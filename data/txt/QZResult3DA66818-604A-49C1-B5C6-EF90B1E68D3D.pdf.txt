ABSTRACT
Gefitinib resistance has been shown to complicate cancer therapy. Lovastatin
is a proteasome inhibitor that enhances gefitinib-induced antiproliferation in nonsmall cell lung cancer. The objective of this study is to investigate the mechanism of
lovastatin-induced antiproliferation in gefitinib-resistant human cholangiocarcinoma.
Two gefitinib-resistant cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, SSP-25 and HuH-28, were
used in this study to determine how to compensate gefitinib resistance. The combined
effect of these two drugs was examined using the MTT assay, qPCR, immunoblotting,
flow cytometry, and in vivo xenograft. Results indicated that lovastatin enhanced TNFα-induced cell death in vitro. In addition, the combination of lovastatin with gefitinib
enhanced accumulation of TNF-α. Furthermore, the treatment induced a synergistic
cytotoxic effect and antiproliferation through apoptosis in SSP-25 cells and cell cycle
arrest in HuH-28 cells. Reproductive results were also observed in in vivo xenografts.
These observations suggest that the combination of gefitinib and lovastatin might
have additive antiproliferative effects against gefitinib-resistant cholangiocarcinoma
cells. Based on these observations, we concluded that the combination of gefitinib and
lovastatin could be used to overcome gefitinib resistance in cholangiocarcinoma cells.

mutations in the kinase domain are in biliary cancer [1].
K-ras mutation and aberrant expression of p53 are present
in one-third of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas [2].
These mutations lead to the resistance to many
chemotherapeutic agents in cholangiocarcinomas [3, 4]
but there is no standard therapy in this situation [5, 6].
LKB1 (also known as serine-threonine kinase
11, STK11) is a tumor suppressor, which is mutated in
various cancers including cholangiocarcinomas [7].

INTRODUCTION
Cholangiocarcinomas are malignant tumors of the
intra- or extrahepatic biliary tract and are the second
most common type of primary liver cancer. An increasing
incidence of cholangiocarcinoma has been documented.
They are associated with a high rate of mortality because
of the difficulty in early detection and their resistance
to chemotherapeutic agents. 15% of the EGFR gene

Physiologically, LKB1 possesses multiple cellular
functions in the regulation of cell cycle arrest, cell
bioenergetics metabolism, embryo development, cell
polarity, and apoptosis [8]. LKB1 has been shown
to regulate PAK-LIMK-cofilin and cyclin D1/CDK4
pathways [9]. The overexpression of the LKB1 protein
significantly inhibits tumor growth in breast cancer cells
[10]. The phosphorylation of LKB1 is regulated by several
growth factors including EGF and TNF-α [7]. Mutation
or loss of LKB1 drives tumorigenesis in several types of
tumors [11–14].
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been
reported to play an important role in pathogenesis in biliary
tract carcinoma [15]. Activation of EGFR is sustained
following EGF stimulation in cholangiocarcinoma cells.
The prolonged EGFR activation results in extended ERK1/2
activation in cholangiocarcinoma cells [16]. K-ras belongs
to a group of genes that encode a family of guanosine
triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins involved in regulating
prosurvival signaling pathways downstream from EGFR
[17]. Mutant K-ras renders the constitutively GTP-bound
protein, eventually resulting in the activation of the MEKERK and the PI3K-AKT antiapoptotic pathways. AKT
activation is associated with disease progression in lung
adenocarcinoma with wild-type EGFR in patients treated
with gefitinib. Administering IGF1R-TKI decreases AKT
signaling and restores gefitinib sensitivity in mutant K-ras
cells [18]. Gefitinib has been reported to be a radiosensitiser,
which inhibits radiation-induced phosphorylation of EGFR
and the downstream pathway and therefore enhances
radiosensitivity in cholangiocarcinoma cells [1, 19].
Lovastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor; its inhib­
itory action on HMG-CoA reductase leads to the
depletion of isoprenoids, which inhibits posttranslational
modification of K-ras [20]. The effect of the combination
of lovastatin with gefitinib on gefitinib-resistant human
nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 and NCI-H460
cell lines with K-ras mutations has shown to effectively
downregulate K-ras protein and suppress the Raf, ERK1/2,
AKT, and EGFR phosphorylation in both cell lines [20].
These effects are correlated with both the upregulation of
cleaved caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
and Bax, and the downregulation of Bcl-2. Similar results
are observed in the combined treatment of lovastatin
(1 μM) and gefitinib inhibits proliferation, which promotes
cell apoptosis, and reduces the AKT activity in K-ras
mutant NSCLC cells compared with gefitinib alone [21].
In this study, two cholangiocarcinoma SSP-25 cells
and HuH-28 cells were treated with gefitinib, lovastatin, or
their combination. Conversely, both gefitinib and lovastatin
induced cell cycle arrest through LKB1 in HuH-28 cells.
On the other hand, gefitinib induced autophagy and
lovastatin induced apoptosis in SSP-25 cells. Furthermore,
inducible TNF-α by lovastatin played one of cruicial roles

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in lovastatin-induced antiproliferation. The addition of
gefitinib did enhance lovastatin-induced TNF-α expression
and thereafter antiproliferation occurred. The observations
were reproduced in xenograft modeling. These studies
indicated that the combined treatment of gefitinib and
lovastatin induced a synergistic cytotoxic effect through
increased TNF-α expression and caused antiproliferation in
cholangiocarcinomas with different LKB-1 statuses.

RESULTS
The combined treatment of gefitinib and
lovastatin induced antiproliferation in human
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma SSP-25 and
HuH-28 cells
The effect of the combination of gefitinib and
lovastatin to attenuate the viability of SSP-25 and HuH-28
cells was evaluated using the MTT assay. As shown in
Fig.1A, SSP-25 and HuH-28 cells were resistant to gefitinib;
however, the combined treatment of gefitinib and lovastatin
significantly decreased viability in a concentration-dependent
manner. For combined treatments, a fixed concentration ratio,
also determined using the cell survival values, was applied.
CI values were calculated using the CompuSyn software,
as described in Materials and Methods; the representative
Fa-CI plots are shown in Fig. 1B. The combined ratio of
1:1 was with lower combination index and with ED:50
8.34 μM and 8.748 μM in SSP-25 and HuH-28 cell lines.
The fixed concentration of gefinitib/lovastatin:10 μM/10
μM was used in the study. The effect of gefinitib, lovastatin
and the combination was also examined in YSCCC,
a cholangiocarcinoma cell line which is more sensitive
to gefitinib. The similar addative effect in the combined
treatment was observed (data not shown).

The combined treatment of lovastatin and
gefitinib with synergistic effect on TNF-α
expression
To investigate whether gefitinib enhanced lovastatinregulated mechanisms, the expression of TNF-α was
examined. The results indicated that lovastatin, but not
gefitinib, induced the expression of TNF-α mRNA in
SSP-25 cells (Fig. 2A). By contrast, both lovastatin
and gefitinib induced the expression of TNF-α mRNA
in HuH-28 cells, but lovastatin was found to be more
effective (Fig. 2A). However, the combined treatment
of lovastatin and gefitinib increased the expression of
TNF-α mRNA compared with that of the signal agents
in both cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A). The increased TNF-α
protein was also observed in the combined treatment
(Fig.  2B). To confirm the role of TNF-α in lovastatininduced antiproliferation in both cell lines, an anti-TNF-α
antibody was used to neutralize accumulated proteins in

lovastatin and gefitinib. The results presented in Fig. 2C
indicated that pretreatment with the anti-TNF-α antibody
reduced lovastatin-induced an antiproliferation effect

in both cell lines. This suggests that although there are
different gene statuses in these two cholangiocarcinoma
cell lines, gefitinib can potentiate lovastatin-induced
antiproliferation through enhancing TNF-α expression.

lovastatin induced cell cycle arrest in
HuH-28 cells through LKB1 activation

autophagy in SSP-25 cells. However, the autophagy was
caused by cell survival responses.

The combined treatment of gefitinib and
lovastatin enhanced antitumor activity in vivo

To further examine the mechanisms involved
in gefitinib and lovastatin-induced antiproliferation in
HuH-28 cell lines, apoptosis, autophagy, and the cell
cycle was detected. The combined treatment of gefitinib
and lovastatin increased the LKB1 activation, and
downregulated park, cyclin D1, and cyclin D3 expression
in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The
results also showed that the combined treatment induced
cell cycle arrest (Fig. 3B), but did not affect apoptosis
or autophagy (Fig. 3C, 3D and 3E). To directly confirm
the role of LKB1 in lovastatin/gefitinib treatment, the
knockdown of LKB1 expression to reduce drug-regulated
antiproliferation was observed (Fig. 3F). These results
suggested that the combined treatment regulated cell cycle
arrest through LKB1 activation in HuH-28 cells.

To evaluate the antitumor activity of the combined
treatment in vivo, we used the hollow fiber assay in
mouse models (Fig. 5A). The results of the treatment
with gefitinib, lovastatin, or their combination indicated
that the antitumor growth ability was consistent with that
noted in studies on cell cultures (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the
expression of TNF-α mRNA increased after treatment
with these agents (Fig. 5C). These data confirmed that the
combined treatment of gefitinib and lovastatin induced
synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. To further confirm
the mechanism in vivo, we used immunohistochemistry to
observe the mechanism (Fig. 6). The results indicated that
the combined treatment inhibited the ERK phosphorylation
and increased the expression of TNF-α in these two cell
lines in vivo xenograft studies. In addition, the combined
treatment also increased LKB1 phosphorylation in
HuH-28 cells in xenograft.
These results suggested that although the
combined treatment of gefitimb and lovastatin induced
antiproliferation in SSP-25 and HuH-28 cells through
different mechanisms, with the former through cell cycle
arrest and the latter through apoptosis, potentiation by
gefitinb of the lovastatin-induced TNF-α played a key role
in the combined treatment of gefitinib-resistant human
cholangiocarcinoma cells.

The combined treatment of lovastatin and
gefitinib inhibit SSP-25 cells proliferation
through apoptosis
To determine whether an antiproliferation response
was involved in the combined treatment of gefitinib
and lovastatin in SSP-25 cells, the apoptotic markers
including Annexin-V, the sub-G1, the cleavage of
caspase-3, PARP, and autophagy markers LC3A and
LC3B were examined in the cells treated with lovastatin,
gefitinib, or their combination. The results indicated
that the combined treatment of lovastatin and gefitinib
induced apoptosis and autophagy (Fig. 4A, 4B and 4C) in
SSP-25 cells, but did not affect the cell cycle population
(Fig. 4D). The results suggest that apoptosis was induced
by lovastatin while autophagy was induced by gefitinib
(Fig. 4A). In order to confirm the LKB1 function
in SSP-25 cell line, knockdown of LKB1 was was
conducted. However, knockdown of LKB1 did not affect
the gefitinib and lovastatin-induced anti-proliferation
(data not show). These results demonstrated that the
combined treatment of lovastatin and gefitinib-induced
anti-proliferation is LKB1 independent in SSP-25. The
autophagic response induced LC3A and LC3B cleavage
and was activated through ATG5/ATG12 complex
formation, but did not affect the ATG7 and Beclin-1
(Fig. 4E). To directly confirm the role of autophagy
in the combined treatment, ATG5 was knocked
down to block ATG5/ATG12 complex-induced
autophagy formation and an inhibitor of authophagy,
3-MA, was also used. The results indicated that
blockage of the autophagic process enhanced
lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4F and 4G).
These results suggested that the combined treatment
of gefitinib and lovastatin induced cell apoptosis and

DISCUSSION
The combined treatment of multiple agents on
cancer has been practiced for years. The efficacy is
often greater than that of the single agent. For example,
atorvastatin (5 μM) enhances gefitinib cytotoxicity through
concomitant inhibition of AKT and ERK activity [21]. It
also interrupts K-ras/PI3K and K-ras/Raf complexes,
leading to the suppression of AKT and ERK activity.
Similar results were also obtained in commutant K-ras/
PTEN or K-ras/PIK3CA NSCLC cells. Simvastatin
ameliorates I/R-induced liver and lung tissue damaged
by inhibiting the level of inflammation and the apoptotic
pathways [22]. The combination of lovastatin and gefitinib
effectively downregulates ras protein and suppresses
the Raf, ERK1/2, AKT, and EGFR phosphorylation in
gefitinib-resistant A549 and NCI-H460 human NSCLC
cells [20].
Lovastatin (1–25 μM, 24 h) induces LKB1
activation in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell
lines SCC9 and SCC25 [23]. LKB1 has been reported to
regulate cell cycle G1 arrest through downregulated cyclin
D1 and cyclin D3 [5], The results of our study indicate

that the combined treatment induced LKB1 activation,
sequential cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 downregulation, and
cell cycle arrest in HuH-28 cells (Fig. 3). By contrast, the
combined treatment of gefitinib and lovastatin induced
the cell apoptosis through LKB1 indenpend pathway
in SSP-25 cells (data not show). Meanwhile, increased
TNF-α expression was observed (Fig. 2). TNF-α has
been reported to induce LKB1 phosphorylation and
cell apoptosis [7, 24]. These results indicated that the
combined treatment induced anti-proliferation via TNF-α
expression to lead to cell death by different mechanisms
in cholangiocarcinoma cells with different LKB1 status.
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib
and erlotinib, activate autophagy as a cytoprotective
response in human lung cancer cells [25]. Cytotoxicity
induced by gefitinib or erlotinib was considerably enhanced
after autophagy inhibition by the pharmacological
inhibitor chloroquine and siRNAs targeting ATG5 and
ATG7, the most crucial components for the formation
of autophagosome [25]. In this study, the knockdown
of ATG5 and the treatment with 3-MA to inhibit
autophagy process enhanced the cytotoxicity induced
by the combined treatment of gefitinib and lovastatin in
SSP-25 cells (Fig. 4). Our data suggest that gefitinibinduced autophagy maybe crucial for cell survival.
Activation of the EGFR signal pathway reduces
TNF-α-related
apoptosis-inducing
ligand-induced
apoptosis through AKT- and XIAP-dependent
mechanisms in EGFR-dependent human bladder cancer
cells [26]. Studies have shown that the combined
treatment of TNF-α and gefitinib is an efficient
therapeutic strategy for tumors that develop resistance to
gefitinib [27]. Lovastatin has been reported to increase
the LPS-induced production of TNF-α [28]. In this
study, lovastatin induced apoptosis or cell cycle arrest
through TNF-α pathway in two gefitinib-resistant human
cholangiocarcinoma cells (Figs. 3 and 4). However, the
enhanced effect of the combined treatment of gefitinib
and lovastatin on the lovastatin-induced expression of
TNF-α was observed in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 2, 5 and 6).
Additionally, pre-treatment with TNF-α antibody
could reduce TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity in vitro
(Fig. 2C). However, the concentration of TNF-α in the
cell was very low (Fig. 2B), and the released TNF-α in
the medium was undetected (Results not shown). These
suggest that TNF-α may be undetectable in serum and
thus is less impacted by TNF-α antibody in animal
models. The TNF-α-induced signal transduction pathway
has been shown to be a possible target of gefitinib in
suppressing the intrahepatic metastasis of hepatocellular
carcinoma [29]. These data demonstrate the crosstalk
between the EGFR signaling pathway and TNF-α
signaling pathway in cholangiocarcinoma cells; similar
results were observed in human lung adenocarcinoma
cells, bladder cancer cells, and hepatocellular carcinoma
cells [26, 27, 29]. TNF-α treatment induces an elevated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NFκB/p65 activation, leading to relatively high p21 levels
and increased sensitivity to gefitinib in PC-9-ZD cells
[27]. These data indicate the correlation between TNF-α
and EGFR pathway. In the current study, the results
show that lovastatin induces TNF-α increase and that its
combination with gefitinib additionally enhances TNF-α
expression [26, 27, 29].
In summary, gefitinib induced autophagy and
lovastatin induced apoptosis in SSP-25 cells. By contrast,
both gefitinib and lovastatin induced cell cycle arrest
in HuH-28 cells. In addition, lovastatin induced the
expression of TNF-α, and gefitinib enhanced lovastatininduced antiproliferation through collaborating TNF-α
expression in both cancer cell lines. Therefore, lovastatin
could be used in cholangiocarcinoma cells either alone or
in combination with gefitinib in human gefitinib-resistant
cholangiocarcinoma cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture and drugs
The human cholangiocarcinoma SSP-25 cells and
HuH-28 cells were purchased from RIKEN Bioresource
Center (Ibaraki, Japan) and preserved for the study in
RPMI-1640 or minimum essential medium content with
10% FBS and P/S solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in
5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Gefitinib was purchased from
Selleckchem, and lovastatin was purchased from Sigma.

Cell viability assay
The cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded in
96-well plates and treated or untreated for 72 hours. Cell
proliferation was determined by incubating the cells
with 200 mL of a fresh medium containing 1 mg/mL 
3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hours at 37°C.
After the MTT solution was removed, the resulting
formazan crystals were dissolved completely in an
ethanol/dimethyl sulfoxide mixture (1:1), and the
plates were read using a microplate reader (Anthos
2010; Biochrom, Cambridge, UK) by measuring the
absorbance at 490 nm. Triplicate wells were assayed
for each experiment, and three independent experiments
were performed. The combination index (CI) and
fraction affected (Fa) of gefitinib and lovastatin for
antiproliferation treatment were evaluated using the
method by Chou and Talalay with CompuSyn freeware

Preparation of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA)
microtube array membranes (MTAMs)

Cell cycle analysis
To measure cell cycle arrest induced by gefitinib
and lovastatin, six-well tissue culture plates were seeded
with SSP-25 or HuH-28 cells (2 × 106 cells) in RPMI-1640
or MEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were treated with
gefitinib, lovastatin, or their combination for 24 hours.
Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with ethanol. Then
they were stained with propidium iodide (PI; 10 μg/mL)
containing RNase (1 mg/mL) at 37°C for 1 hour. Flow
cytometry analysis of the DNA content of the cells was
performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, USA), and 10 000 events were collected and
analyzed using the WinMDI 2.9 software.

Materials used were PLLA (BioTechOne, Taiwan),
polyethylene glycol/polyethylene oxide (PEG/PEO;
Sigma-Aldrich), N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF; Tedia,
USA), and dichloromethane (DCM; Mallinckrodt, USA).
To prepare the electrospinning dopes, PLLA was dissolved
in mixed DCM/DMF (8/2) solvents at room temperature
to obtain a 10% solution. PEG was added to the PLLA
solution to obtain PEG/PLLA (30/70) solutions, as
described previously. [32–34] An electrostatics charger
(ChargeMaster, Simco-Ion, Alameda, CA, USA) or a high
voltage power supply unit (You-Shang Co., Fongshan city,
Taiwan) was used as the source of electrostatics. Typically,
electrospinning was performed by delivering the PLLA
(shell) and PEG (core) solutions through a house-made
co-axial spinneret with a syringe pump (KDS-100, KD
Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) at the rate of 4–9 mL/h,
with 5–7 kV of applied voltage and 3–5 cm of distance to
a rotating drum collector. All electrospinning procedures
were performed in a chamber at a relative humidity
of 50% ± 5% and a temperature of 25 oC ± 1oC. PLLA
MTAMs were obtained by washing to remove the core
component of PEG, followed by drying.

Western blotting
After customized treatments, the cells were lyzed in
cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2%
Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 1× protease
inhibitor mixture), and the protein concentration was
determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL). Cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; they were
probed with an antibody against PARP-1(GTX100573),
ERK1(113094), and GAPDH(100118) purchased
from Genetex Inc. (San Antonio, TX), and LKB1
(ab15095), p-LKB1(Ser428)(ab63473) purchase from
Abcam(Cambridge, UK) and p-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204)

replace the conventional xenograft in this study [4].
A novel hollow fiber substrate-MTAMs were synthesized
and provided by Dr. Chen Chien-Chung (TMU, Taipei,
Taiwan) [36]. Twenty male ICR outbred mice (10 wk
old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories
(Wilmington, US) and purchased from the BioLASCO
(Yi-Lan, Taiwan). Animal breeding was performed
according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee, which are based on the
guidelines of the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care including
facility. Mice were housed in the TMU Laboratory
Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan) in a conventional
environment at constant temperature (20°C ± 3°C)
and humidity (50% ± 20%). The animals had free
access to autoclaved dry granule food and water
during the study period. Each animal was seeded
with two MTAMs with different cells grown
(1 × 105) on the backside. After 3 days of cell
proliferation, the animals were treated intravenously
with gefitinib (10 mg/kg/d), lovastatin (10 mg/kg/12 h),
and their combination (as shown in Fig. 5A). The
MTAMs were harvested 72 hours after injection. A
general clinical observation (e.g., in life numbers, body
weight, food consumption) was made twice daily by a
veterinarian.
