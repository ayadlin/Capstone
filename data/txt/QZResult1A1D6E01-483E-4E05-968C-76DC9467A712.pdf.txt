BACKGROUND: Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is associated with an aggressive biology and a poor prognosis. Poorrisk RCC is defined by clinical prognostic factors and demonstrates similarly aggressive behavior. No standard treatment exists
for patients with sarcomatoid RCC, and treatment options for patients with poor-risk disease are of limited benefit. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in clinically aggressive RCC. METHODS: This was a phase 2, single-arm trial of sunitinib and gemcitabine in patients with sarcomatoid or
poor-risk RCC. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included the time to progression
(TTP), overall survival (OS), safety, and biomarker correlatives. RESULTS: Overall, 39 patients had sarcomatoid RCC, and 33 had
poor-risk RCC. The ORR was 26% for patients with sarcomatoid RCC and 24% for patients with poor-risk RCC. The median TTP and OS for
patients with sarcomatoid RCC were 5 and 10 months, respectively. For patients with poor-risk disease, the median TTP and OS were 5.5
and 15 months, respectively. Patients whose tumors had >10% sarcomatoid histology had a higher clinical benefit rate (ORR plus stable disease) than those with 10% sarcomatoid histology (P 5.04). The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events
included neutropenia (n 5 20), anemia (n 5 10), and fatigue (n 5 7). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that antiangiogenic therapy
and cytotoxic chemotherapy are an active and well-tolerated combination for patients with aggressive RCC. The combination may be

INTRODUCTION
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) consists of a biologically heterogeneous group of tumors with distinct histopathologic and
clinical features. Sarcomatoid RCC, a morphologic feature that can be identified across all RCC histologies, is characterized by the occurrence of spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells. The presence of sarcomatoid features has been reported in up
to 29% of collecting duct carcinomas, in 9% to 11% of clear cell, chromophobe, and unclassified RCCs, and less frequently in papillary RCC (3%).1 Regardless of the underlying histology, sarcomatoid differentiation is associated with a
more aggressive disease phenotype.2,3 In most series, patients with metastatic sarcomatoid RCC had an estimated overall
survival (OS) of 6 to 10 months.3-5
In addition to sarcomatoid RCC, there are patients with a nonsarcomatoid histology who demonstrate similarly
aggressive tumor biology and rapid clinical disease progression. Several clinical factors have been described to identify
patients with poor-risk disease. Motzer et al6 initially characterized 5 risk factors (decreased performance status, elevated
serum lactate dehydrogenase, elevated serum calcium, anemia, and absence of prior nephrectomy) as prognostic, and
patients with 3 or more of these risk factors were defined as poor-risk. This population included approximately 20% of
patients with metastatic RCC and had a median survival of 4 months.6 In addition, a large phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy of temsirolimus in poor-risk patients (defined as those with 3 or more of the aforementioned risk factors or 2 factors
and multiple sites of metastasis) demonstrated a median OS of 7 to 11 months in the treatment arms.7

Original Article

The advent of therapy targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways has improved outcomes for
patients with metastatic RCC. Despite recent advances, experience with these new agents is limited in sarcomatoid
RCC. Furthermore, with the exception of the temsirolimus phase 3 trial described previously, trials informing the
management of patients with predominantly poor-risk disease are lacking.7 Most reported first-line phase 3 trials do
not specify the presence of sarcomatoid features, and less
than 10% of the patients have had poor-risk disease.8-11
Because of the limited prospective data for guiding treatment and the aggressive tumor behavior, the exploration of
new therapeutic approaches that could potentially improve
clinical outcomes is needed for this patient population.
RCC has historically been considered resistant to
standard chemotherapy.12 Despite this, chemotherapy
has demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with sarcomatoid or rapidly progressive RCC.13-15 In particular,
the combination of doxorubicin and gemcitabine resulted
in durable remissions (4 of 18) and a median duration of
response of 5 months in patients with sarcomatoid
RCC.15 Retrospective data illustrate some benefit of
VEGF- and mTOR-targeted therapy in sarcomatoid
RCC.5,16 On the basis of this rationale and the potential
for synergy between agents, we investigated the efficacy
and toxicity of multimodality systemic therapy with gemcitabine and sunitinib in patients with sarcomatoid or
poor-risk RCC. The results of this trial led to an ongoing
randomized Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) trial investigating sunitinib with or without
gemcitabine in patients with advanced RCC with sarcomatoid features (NCT01164228).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients were enrolled at 3 institutions: Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute (Boston, Mass), Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center (Boston, Mass), and Massachusetts
General Hospital (Boston, Mass). Eligible patients had
histologically documented metastatic RCC with any
sarcomatoid histology or poor-risk features. This was
defined as having 3 or more of the following characteristics: ECOG performance status > 1, lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 1.5 times the institutional
upper limit of normal, hemoglobin level less than the
institutional lower limit of normal, corrected serum
calcium level > 10 mg/dL, 2 or more sites of metastatic disease, and time from the initial diagnosis to
3436

evidence of metastatic disease  12 months.7 Patients
with both a sarcomatoid histology and poor-risk clinical features were counted in the sarcomatoid cohort.
Patients were required to have evidence of measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Other inclusion criteria
included adequate organ function and hematologic parameters. Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had received sunitinib
or gemcitabine previously or had received more than 1
metastatic RCC systemic therapy. All patients provided
written informed consent.
This study was conducted after approval from the
institutional review board of the Dana Farber/Harvard
Cancer Center.
Study Design and Treatment

This was a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study of sunitinib and gemcitabine in sarcomatoid and/or poor-risk
patients with metastatic RCC (NCT00556049). In total,
72 patients were enrolled into the study between December 2007 and July 2013. At the time of data retrieval in
August 2014, all patients were off treatment. All patients
received treatment with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle) and sunitinib
(37.5 mg orally daily for 14 consecutive days followed by 7
days off treatment). The doses of each agent were established on the basis of prior phase 1 experience.17 Dose
reductions were allowed for one drug, both drugs, or neither drug according to the type, severity, and likely attribution of the adverse event. The first dose-reduction level of
gemcitabine was 750 mg/m2, and the second was 600 mg/
m2. There was 1 dose reduction allowed for sunitinib (to
25 mg/d). Disease was assessed by imaging at the baseline
and every 3 cycles. Patients remained in the study until
they demonstrated disease progression, intolerable toxicity,
or completed 15 cycles of therapy.
A Simon 2-stage design was used to evaluate the sarcomatoid and poor-risk groups (target a 5 .15, b 5 .20).
The regimen would be considered promising if there were
a 15% or greater objective response rate (ORR) and not
worthy of further evaluation if the ORR were 5%.
Twenty patients were enrolled in the first stage. Because 1
or more patients demonstrated an ORR within each
group, accrual was continued within each group to the
total goal. The regimen would be considered worthy of
further study for either of the 2 groups if at least 4 of 36
patients within that group responded. With this design,
the probability of terminating the study after 20 patients
was 0.36 if the true but unknown ORR was 5%, and it

was 0.04 if the true but unknown ORR was 15%. The
probability that the regimen would be considered active
was 10% if the true ORR was 5% and 80% if the true
ORR was 15% (actual a 5 .101, b 5 .199).
Study Endpoints

The primary endpoint was an ORR defined by RECIST
(version 1.0) and reviewed by a central, independent,
third-party core imaging laboratory. We summarized the
shrinkage of the sum of the longest tumor diameter, calculated the percent reduction from the baseline, and reported
the largest magnitude of shrinkage for each patient. Secondary endpoints included the time to progression (TTP),
OS, safety, and biomarker analysis. TTP was defined as
the time from the initiation of therapy to the date of progression, drug discontinuation, or death, or it was censored
at the last follow-up. OS was defined as the time from the
initiation of therapy to death from any cause, or it was censored at the date of the last follow-up. Safety and tolerability were monitored throughout the study and graded
according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Pathologic Assessment

For patients with pathologically confirmed sarcomatoid
RCC and 3 hematoxylin-eosin–stained slides containing
tumor tissue, a central review was performed by an expert
genitourinary pathologist (S.S.) blinded to patient outcomes.
A minimum of 3 slides were requested to allow an accurate
determination of the percentage of the sarcomatoid component. The percentage of the sarcomatoid component was
estimated in each nephrectomy or metastasectomy sample.
Statistical Analysis

Variables were summarized as numbers and percentage for
categorical variables and as medians and interquartile
ranges for continuous variables. The distributions of TTP
and OS were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). ORRs were summarized as numbers and percentages, with 85% CIs calculated
with an exact binomial test. Associations of responses and
percentages of sarcomatoid elements were assessed with
Fisher’s exact test. The statistical analysis was undertaken
with SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R 2.10.1 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Baseline and disease characteristics are detailed in Table 1.
Overall, 39 patients had sarcomatoid disease, and 33
patients had poor-risk disease. The median age for the total
Cancer

October 1, 2015

cohort was 61 years. Liver metastases were more commonly present in patients with poor-risk disease. Only 5
patients received prior systemic therapy: 4 patients who
received prior temsirolimus and 1 patient who received
prior axitinib. In patients with sarcomatoid RCC, the median percentage of sarcomatoid features as determined by a
post hoc central review was 15% (0%-100%; Fig. 1).
Treatment Exposure

The median number of cycles received for both gemcitabine and sunitinib was 5. With respect to gemcitabine, 30
patients had day 1 treatment delays, and 27 underwent
dose modifications. Twenty-two patients had day 8 treatment delays, and 36 underwent dose modifications. With
respect to sunitinib, 44 patients had treatment delays, and
6 underwent dose reductions.
Response Rate

The median time to the best response was 2 months. The
ORR according to RECIST version 1.0 was 26% (85%
CI, 16%-38%) for patients with sarcomatoid RCC and
24% (85% CI, 14%-38%) for patients with poor-risk
RCC (Table 2). Most patients had stable disease as the
best response (38% for sarcomatoid RCC and 39% for
poor-risk RCC). The median tumor shrinkage was
211% (2100% to 940%) in the sarcomatoid patients
and 219% (255% to 980%) in the poor-risk patients.
Of the sarcomatoid patients with pathology data
available for central review (27 of 39 or 69%), 21 had
available response data. Patients with tumors with >10%
sarcomatoid histology (10 of 21) were more likely to
achieve stable disease or better than patients with tumors
with 10% sarcomatoid histology (100% and 54.5% for
patients with >10% and 10% sarcomatoid histology,
respectively; P 5 .04).
A total of 70 patients had histology subtype data
available. For both sarcomatoid and poor-risk patients,
there was a trend toward an improved ORR in patients
with a clear cell histology (ORR, 32% for patients with a
clear cell histology vs 16% for patients with a non–clear
cell histology; P 5 .23).
TTP and OS

The median TTP and OS for patients with sarcomatoid
RCC were 5 months (95% CI, 3-9 months) and 10
months (95% CI, 6-23 months), respectively (Fig. 2). For
patients with poor-risk disease, the median TTP and OS
were 5.5 months (95% CI, 2-9 months) and 15 months
(95% CI, 9-29 months), respectively (Fig. 2). The
median TTP for patients with a non–clear cell histology
and patients with a clear cell histology were 3 months

and hypophosphatemia (n 5 3). Table 3 lists the most frequent treatment-related adverse events. No grade 5 toxicities were seen.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that multimodality therapy
with gemcitabine and sunitinib is feasible and is associated
with objective responses in patients with sarcomatoid or
poor-risk RCC. This approach may compare favorably to
previous studies of chemotherapy or antiangiogenic therapy alone in these patient populations. In this study, the
ORRs were 26% and 24% for patients with sarcomatoid
and poor-risk RCC, respectively.
Large prospective trials of sunitinib alone have demonstrated ORRs of 25% to 30% and progression-free survival (PFS) of 10 to 11 months in primarily intermediateor favorable-risk disease.9,10 Gemcitabine has been investigated alone and in combination with alternative cytotoxic agents and/or immunotherapy with limited response
rates of 10%.12 Studies comparing combination chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy in patients with RCC
are limited. A phase 2 study evaluating the combination
of gemcitabine and capecitabine with sorafenib followed
by sorafenib monotherapy demonstrated an ORR of 45%
with a PFS of 11 months; this was greater than that
observed with either agent alone.18 Other studies investigating bevacizumab with chemotherapy, including gemcitabine, have demonstrated responses ranging from 11%
to 30% and TTPs ranging from 6 to 11 months.19,20
There are limited studies evaluating treatment
options for patients with sarcomatoid or poor-risk RCC
(Table 4). The combination of gemcitabine and doxorubicin has demonstrated antitumor activity in this subgroup.14,15,21 Nanus et al15 explored this regimen in
patients with sarcomatoid or rapidly progressing RCC
and illustrated an ORR of 39%. Long-term follow-up
demonstrated durables responses in 4 patients.13 A larger
study published by ECOG reported an ORR of 16% in

this population but a median PFS of 3.5 months and an
OS of 8.8 months.14 More responses were observed in
patients with a higher percentage of sarcomatoid differentiation. Similarly, in our study, patients with >10% sarcomatoid differentiation were more likely to achieve
clinical benefits than those with 10% sarcomatoid differentiation. This evidence highlights that sarcomatoid
RCC may have distinct biological properties that predispose it to being more sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy
than nonsarcomatoid RCC.
There are limited studies evaluating antiangiogenic
therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy specifically in sarcomatoid or poor-risk RCC. A retrospective
analysis of 43 patients with sarcomatoid RCC treated
with VEGF-targeted therapy demonstrated an ORR of
19% with a PFS of 5.3 months and an OS of 11.8
months.16 This study further demonstrated that patients
with a lower percentage of sarcomatoid differentiation
had better responses to VEGF-targeted therapy. Translational studies have demonstrated that RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation has decreased expression of hypoxiainducible factor 1a, a primary transcription factor
involved in angiogenesis, and this suggests that antiangiogenic therapies alone may be less effective in this subgroup
and that combinatorial or alternative strategies are warranted.22 In our initial phase 1 study of the combination
of gemcitabine and sunitinib, partial responses were
observed in 26% of the patients (6 of 23), and stable disease was observed in 57% of patients lasting 6 weeks or
longer.17
To explore the molecular underpinnings of rapidly progressive RCC, we used molecular profiling
platforms to identify actionable genomic alterations
in tumor specimens. From our evaluation of 11
patients, we did not identify any clinically significant
genomic alterations with massively parallel sequencing
technology (OncoPanel for Dana-Farber Cancer Institute patients) or multiplex polymerase chain reactions
and single-base extension reactions (SNaPshot for
Massachusetts General Hospital patients), as previously described.23,24 The molecular features of sarcomatoid or poor-risk RCC have not been extensively
described. Comparative RNA sequencing of adjacent
sarcomatoid and clear cell histologies from 5 patients
demonstrated increased aurora kinase A–dependent
activation of mTOR signaling in sarcomatoid RCC.25
Comprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell
RCC has highlighted the importance of the Von
Hippel–Lindau/hypoxia-inducible factor, chromatin
remodeling/histone methylation, and phosphoinositide
3442

3-kinase/AKT pathways.26 Investigations to further
characterize the molecular landscape of rapidly progressive RCC will be critical for developing future
therapeutic options for patients.
With respect to poor-risk disease, many studies have
documented shorter survival in patients with specific clinical features.6,7,27 In our cohort, we defined patients with
poor-risk disease according to the Hudes criteria, as used in
a large phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of temsirolimus. The Hudes criteria incorporate the number of metastatic sites into the already established Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center risk factors.6,7 More than 1 site of
metastasis, a surrogate for the overall tumor burden, has
previously been described as a poor-risk factor in RCC.28
Combinatorial chemotherapy and standard antiangiogenic therapy may have an additive effect in comparison with either agent alone in patients with sarcomatoid
or rapidly progressive RCC. A randomized study investigating this approach in a larger patient population is currently ongoing.
In summary, we have demonstrated that patients
with sarcomatoid or poor-risk RCC have frequent objective responses with acceptable toxicity when they are treated
with a multimodality therapy consisting of gemcitabine
and sunitinib. A prospective, randomized trial is underway
to validate our study findings. Patients with rapidly progressive disease may have fundamentally differing disease
pathogeneses, and molecular studies are warranted to investigate disease drivers and potential therapeutic targets.
