Abstract

Author Manuscript

Interactions between tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor
microenvironment (TMEN) significantly influence cancer growth and metastasis. Transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β) is known to be a critical mediator of the CAF phenotype, and osteopontin
(OPN) expression in tumors is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor patient
outcomes. The potential link between these two pathways has not been previously addressed.
Utilizing in vitro studies using human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MDA-MB231 (OPN
+) and MCF7 (OPN−) human breast cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that OPN induces integrindependent MSC expression of TGF-β1 to mediate adoption of the CAF phenotype. This OPNTGF-β1 pathway requires the transcription factor, myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1). In vivo studies
with xenotransplant models in NOD-scid mice showed that OPN expression increases cancer
growth and metastasis by mediating MSC-to-CAF transformation in a process that is MZF1- and
TGF-β1-dependent. We conclude that tumor-derived OPN engenders MSC-to-CAF transformation
in the microenvironment to promote tumor growth and metastasis via the OPN-MZF1-TGF-β1
pathway.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Tumor growth and metastasis is highly dependent on complex dynamic interactions between
cancer cells and tumor stroma, mediated by direct cell-cell contact and secreted growth
factors and cytokines. CAFs, a tumor stromal element, are involved in tumor growth
potentiation, extracellular matrix degradation, tumor cell motility, inhibition of host antitumor response, promotion of angiogenesis and metastasis. CAF origin is likely
multifactorial, derived from local fibroblasts, bone marrow-MSCs, pericytes and tumor
cells. Defining molecular markers and the signal pathways that mediate CAF activation are
poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that α-smooth muscle actin (SMA),
tenascin-C, vimentin and fibroblast specific protein-1 (FSP-1), among others, describe the
CAF phenotype.1, 2 In addition, TGF-β is critical for CAF activation and elaboration of a
pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.3-6 Signaling by TGF-β regulates tumor initiation,
progression and metastasis through tumor cell-autonomous and host–tumor interactions.

Author Manuscript

OPN, a phosphoprotein secreted by malignant cells and tumor stromal cells, is a key
mediator of tumor cell migration and metastasis and a marker of breast cancer progression
and metastasis.7-13 Recent findings suggest that tumor-derived OPN instigates bone
marrow-derived MSC trafficking to the TMEN,14-16 which is characterized by the
outgrowth of a desmoplastic stroma rich in CAFs that promotes cancer growth and
metastasis.14, 15, 17 However, a direct relationship between OPN and the CAF phenotype has
never been described.
In this study, with in vitro and in vivo human breast cancer models, we demonstrate that
OPN induces MSC-to-CAF transformation. OPN binds to cell-surface integrin receptors to
activate the transcription factor, myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1), and induce MSC production
of TGF-β1. The adoption of the CAF phenotype is associated with increased local tumor
growth and metastases. Aptamer blockade of OPN abolishes this MZF1-TGF-β1 mediated
MSC-to-CAF transformation. This pathway has not been previously characterized.

Results
OPN elicits dose- and time-dependent TGF-β expression in MSCs

Author Manuscript

MSCs were exposed to OPN at increasing concentrations (0 to 320 ng/ml), and active TGFβ protein expression was measured at 48 h (Figure 1A). The mean concentration of TGF-β1
after exposure to 80 ng/ml was 227±7 pg/ml; 619±14 pg/ml after 160 ng/ml; and 872±4
pg/ml after 320 ng/ml (ANOVA p=0.0001). For TGF-β2 and TGF-β3, after exposure to 80
ng/ml, 160 ng/ml, and 320 ng/ml, mean concentrations of each were ~155 pg/ml, 260 pg/ml,
and 425 pg/ml, respectively (ANOVA p=0.0001). Based on this data, in conjunction with
the reported median plasma OPN level of 177 ng/ml in metastatic breast cancer patients,9 all
subsequent studies used an OPN dose of 180 ng/ml.9 MSCs were exposed to OPN at

increasing time intervals (0 to 96 h) (Figure 1B). Time-dependent expression of TGF-β was
observed. All isoforms peaked at 12 h. At all time intervals, except TGF-β3 at 96 hours, the
increase was significant from baseline (p<0.05). Further studies used the 48 h time point.
OPN-mediated TGF-β expression requires integrin cell-surface receptors

Author Manuscript

OPN binds to αvβ3 integrin and CD44 receptors to mediate important cell-cell and cellmatrix signaling pathways.18 To examine the role of these cell-surface receptor pathways in
OPN-mediated TGF-β expression, MSCs were exposed to OPN and the following inhibitors:
RGD, an integrin competitive ligand inhibitor, αvβ3 integrin Ab, CD44 Ab, or APT; control
inhibitors: RGE, IgG, and MuAPT (Figure 1C). Extracellular binding of OPN by APT and
blockade of integrin and CD44 receptors ablated OPN-mediated active TGF-β1, 2, and 3
expression (p<0.01 vs. OPN). The control inhibitors did not alter TGF-β expression.
Pharmacologic inhibition of canonical integrin signaling pathways, Src(PP2;10 μM) or
FAK(PF228;10μM), abolished OPN-mediated TGF-β expression (Data not shown). These
results indicate that OPN-mediated TGF-β expression in MSCs requires OPN binding to
integrin receptors, and to a lesser extent, CD44 receptors.
As TGF-β1 expression is up-regulated to a larger degree than other isoforms, remaining
studies focus on TGF-β1. A similar expression pattern was seen in total TGF-β1 after OPN
exposure (Figure 1D). APT blockade of OPN and integrin receptor blockade resulted in a
significant decrease in total TGF-β1 expression (p<0.01). However, CD44 receptor blockade
had no effect. These results indicate that the primary receptor involved in OPN-mediated
TGF-β1 expression in MSCs is likely integrin.
MSC CAF marker expression is OPN-mediated

Author Manuscript

Expression of OPN-mediated CAF marker (SMA, tenascin-C, vimentin and FSP-1) mRNA
was significantly ablated by APT and RGD (p<0.01 vs. OPN, OPN+MuAPT and OPN
+RGE) (Figure 2A). Of note, on light microscopy, after OPN treatment, MSCs become more
elongated and spindle-shaped. Functional correlation using composite zymography
demonstrated that OPN increased MSC-associated MMP2 and MMP9 activities by 8- and 5fold, respectively (Figure 2B). APT and RGD blocked these increases. OPN increased MSC
adhesion and migration/invasion by 5- and 2-fold, respectively (p<0.01 OPN vs. untreated
MSCs) (Figure 2C). APT, RGD and αvβ3 integrin Ab decreased adhesion and migration/
invasion to baseline. This data indicates that OPN-integrin interactions in MSCs increase
CAF marker expression, MMP activity, adhesion and migration/invasion.

Author Manuscript

MSCs were exposed to OPN once or daily for one week to determine the duration of CAF
marker and TGF-β1 expression. At 2 days, all CAF markers and TGF-β1 were elevated by
8- to 12-fold in both groups (p<0.01). In the group exposed once, all CAF markers and TGFβ1 were decreased by day 7 (p<0.05). In the daily exposure group, by day 5, TGF-β1 was
elevated even further (p<0.05). By day 7, tenascin-C and TGF-β1 were elevated compared to
day 2 (p<0.05) (Figure 2D). These results indicate that under continuous OPN stimulation,
as would likely occur an OPN-producing tumor TMEN, a robust and durable CAF marker
profile persists and TGF-β1 expression is up-regulated to a similar/larger degree.

To determine the functional role of TGF-β1, its’ signaling was blocked using a TGF-β1 type
I receptor inhibitor (SB4) or TGF-β1 type II receptor shRNA. OPN-stimulated CAF marker
expression was ablated (p<0.01 vs. OPN) (Figure 2E). In selected instances, exogenous
recombinant TGF-β1 (400 pg/ml) was administered.19 Exogenous TGF-β1 restored CAF
marker expression in OPN+APT+TGF-β1 (p<0.01 vs. OPN+APT).
BM-MSCs (3000 cells), enriched from normal human bone marrow, were exposed to OPN.
Active TGF-β1 protein increased ~7-fold (p<0.01), total: active TGF-β1 ratio was ~8-10:1
(Data not shown). OPN significantly increased CAF marker mRNA expression, which was
blocked by RGD and APT (p<0.01 vs. OPN) (Figure 2F). Human skin, mammary and lung
fibroblasts and murine embryonic fibroblasts were exposed to human OPN. Active TGF-β1
protein and CAF marker expression was not altered (Data not shown). In summary, OPN−
integrin binding induces TGF-β1 and CAF marker expression in MSCs.

OPN activates TGF-β1 transcription via MZF1

Author Manuscript

The role of OPN in TGF-β1 transcriptional regulation was determined by measuring
recruitment of RNA polymerase II to a consensus TATA box (ATTA located at −1195bp)20
and the final exon. TGF-β1 transcription increased ~20-fold after OPN exposure (p< 0.01)
(Figure 3A). A full-length human TGF-β1 promoter (−3360/+124) was amplified (Figure
3B).21 Stimulation with OPN resulted in >35-fold transactivation with lesser activation of
the first two deletion constructs (Figure 3C). The remaining three deletion constructs
showed no activation after OPN stimulation. The 67bp region (−691 to −624) contained a
canonical binding site for MZF1 (GGGGAGGAGGGGGA), as predicted by TFSearch.22, 23
Two MZF1 consensus DNA-binding sequences have been identified: 5′-AGTGGGGA-3′
and 5′-CGGGGAGGGGGAA-3′ (Figure 3D). This G-rich region is 100% homologous to
the mouse TGF-β1 promoter (−653 to −637). Human and mouse MZF1 proteins are 83%
homologous. MZF1 is involved in cell differentiation, migration and proliferation.24-27

Author Manuscript

ChIP assays targeting −697bp to −600bp confirmed binding of MZF1 and RNA polymerase
II to the TGF-β1 promoter in the presence of OPN (Figure 3E). After OPN exposure, MZF1
binding to the G-rich promoter region increased ~18-fold (p<0.02 vs. MSCs). This putative
MZF1 binding site was mutated to generate two single mutants and one double mutant
(Figure 3D). All mutation constructs demonstrated a significant decrease in luciferase
activity (p<0.03) (Figure 3F). siRNA-mediated silencing of MZF1 significantly decreased
TGF-β1 full-length promoter luciferase activity (p<0.01), MZF1 and TGF-β1 mRNA
(p<0.01) and active TGF-β1 protein expression (p<0.02) in OPN stimulated MSCs
compared to controls (Figure 3G). Taken together, this data indicates that MZF1 regulates
OPN-mediated TGF-β1 transcription and protein expression.
OPN induces TGF-β1-dependent MSC CAF marker expression in breast cancer co-cultures
MSCs were co-cultured in Boyden chambers with MB231(OPN+) or MCF7(OPN−) human
breast cancer cells. All ELISA and qRT-PCR data presented below are results of media from
MSC well or MSC cell lysates only. OPN+ cells exhibit aggressive in vitro indices of
adhesion and migration/invasion. OPN− cells exhibit the opposite.28, 29 MSCs do not
express OPN (Data not shown). After 24 h, in MB231+MSC, active TGF-β1 increased 9-

fold compared to baseline; blockade by αvβ3 Ab, RGD and APT abolished the TGF-β1
response (p<0.01). Conversely, in MCF7+MSC, active TGF-β1 expression was minimal.
Addition of OPN increased active TGF-β1 ~7-fold; this was blocked by αvβ3 Ab, RGD and
APT (p<0.01) (Figure 4A and B). In co-culture with MB231, CAF marker and TGF-β1
mRNA expression increased 20- to 30-fold (p<0.01); abolished by APT, αvβ3 Ab and RGD
(p<0.01); indicating a causative role for OPN-integrin binding. As expected, exogenous
OPN significantly increased CAF marker and TGF-β1 mRNA expression in an integrindependent fashion (Figure 4C and D).

Author Manuscript

Co-culture studies were repeated with SB4, shTGFβR2 and exogenous TGF-β1 (Figure
4E).19 CAF markers in MB231+MSC were significantly decreased with APT and reversed
with exogenous TGF-β1. Similarly, TGF-β1 receptor blockade ablated CAF marker
expression (p<0.01). This data indicates that tumor-derived OPN interacts with MSC
integrin receptors to induce TGF-β1-dependent CAF marker expression. APT blockade of
OPN in MB231 co-culture significantly decreased MZF1 mRNA while ablating MZF1 and
RNA polymerase II binding to the TGF-β1 promoter region. Conversely, co-culture with
MCF7 did not express MZF1 mRNA without exogenous OPN (Figure 4F and G). In parallel
with our previous results, this data suggests that OPN mediates MZF1-dependent TGF-β1
expression to induce CAF marker expression in MSCs.
MZF1 and TGF-β1 expression in mouse models

Author Manuscript

In a MB231+MSC orthotopic xenotransplant model, we previously demonstrated that
extracellular OPN blockade and inactivation by APT significantly inhibits: 1) local breast
cancer growth and metastasis and 2) MSC expression of CAF markers.17 This mouse model
was repeated to study TGF-β1 and MZF1 expression. Animals were injected via tail vein
with APT or MuAPT every 2 days and imaged for 8 weeks. Bioluminescence was greater by
10-fold in MB231+MSC compared with MB231 (p< 0.01) (Figure 5A). Local tumor growth
showed the same pattern as our original study (Data not shown).17 At 8 weeks, MSCs were
isolated from primary tumors and metastatic sites. In MB231+MSC, MZF1 and TGF-β1
mRNA increased by 4- and 8-fold, respectively, in all locations (p<0.01); expression ablated
by APT (Figure 5B and 5C). As expected, CAF markers were readily expressed but ablated
in the presence of APT (Data not shown).

We have previously reported OPN-mediated EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition)
associated growth of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in a mouse xenograft model. 30 To
ascertain the role of our newly proposed OPN-MZF1-TGF-β1 axis in HCC, qRT-PCR was
performed using cDNA from MSCs isolated by FACS from the primary liver tumors of SKHep1+MSC xenografts. APT blockade significantly decreased OPN, MZF1, TGF-β1 and
SMA mRNA expression (p<0.01), supporting the likely presence of the OPN-MZF1-TGFβ1 axis in HCC (Figure 5D).
A series of xenotransplant experiments was performed using dual-labeled MCF7 cells that
constitutively express OPN (RFP-luc-MCF7-lvOPN) implanted alone or co-implanted with
GFP-MSCs. A subset of GFP-MSCs had constitutive MZF1 knockdown (MSC(dMZF1)).
When MCF7-lvOPN were implanted alone, increased growth did not occur until 8 weeks. In
MCF7-lvOPN+MSC mice, tumor growth was significantly greater. Deletion of MZF1

resulted in abrogation of OPN-associated tumor growth in MCF7-lvOPN. In a similar
fashion, APT treatment resulted in ablation of tumor growth in MCF7-lvOPN+MSC mice
(Figure 6A). After 8 weeks, FACS was used to isolate GFP-MSCs and RFP-MCF7 cells
from primary tumors and liver metastases. MCF7-lvOPN+MSC and MCF7-lvOPN+MSC
+MuAPT combinations demonstrated significantly greater fractions of tumor cells (RFP+)
and MSCs (GFP+), suggesting enhanced local growth and metastasis. Similarly, only
MCF7-lvOPN+MSC and MCF7-lvOPN+MSC+MuAPT expressed CAF marker, MZF1 and
TGF-β1 mRNA. When compared to MSCs isolated from MCF7-lvOPN+MSC±MuAPT, the
MSC(d ZF1)s expressed minimal CAF marker, MZF1 and TGF-β1 mRNA (p<0.01) (Figure
6B and 6C). This data demonstrates that enhanced OPN expression in MCF7 in the presence
of MSCs promotes local tumor growth and metastasis, which is inhibited by MZF1 ablation
in MSCs or APT-inactivation of OPN.

Author Manuscript

To elucidate the role of TGF-β1, exogenous TGF-β1 (1.2 ng/mouse/day via tail vein) was
administered to a subgroup of MCF7-lvOPN+MSC(dMZF1).31 With this gain-of-function
study bypassing the inhibition of MSC elaboration of TGF-β1 in MSC(dMZF1)s, exogenous
systemic TGF-β1 accelerated growth and metastasis (Figure 7A and 7B). At Week 5,
luciferase activity was enhanced ~10-fold with TGF-β1 (p<0.01). Primary tumor
MSC(dMZF1)s were isolated by FACS after 6 weeks. CAF markers were strongly expressed
with exogenous TGF-β1; MZF1 was not expressed; TGF-β1 was expressed in a positive
feedback manner (Figure 7C and 7D).19 These results indicate that OPN mediates MZF1dependent TGF-β1 expression in MSCs to promote local tumor growth and metastases via
MSC-to-CAF transformation.
Immunohistochemistry of human breast cancer

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of normal breast (n=2), ER+PR+ breast cancer (n=2),
and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (n=4) tissue samples, obtained under IRB
approval by a collaborative researcher, was performed to assess the correlation of OPN,
TGF-β1, MZF1 and SMA expression. When comparing normal and ER+PR+ (luminal)
breast tissue to TNBC, basal-like thus histologically similar to MB231, there is a definite
difference in quantity and intensity of staining of these proteins (Figure 8). In addition to the
expected higher-grade phenotypic features (minimal tubule formation and enlarged nuclear
size and pleomorphism), the aggressive, poorer prognosis TNBC displays increased
cytosolic expression of all four proteins in the tumor cells and stromal elements. In TNBC,
the quantity of nuclear staining of MZF1 is also increased. The data obtained from this
limited IHC analysis is not enough to draw any conclusion regarding prognostic value of the
OPN-MZF1-TGFβ1 axis, but it does pave the way for future studies to examine this more
closely. This would add to the current data supporting OPN as a prognostic marker for
breast cancer. 32, 33

Discussion
The TMEN significantly influences tumor behavior.6, 34-37 CAFs are a critical constituent,
residing within the tumor or its margins. However, there is lack of an accepted biomarker
definition and controversy over the cell of origin and location of the CAF precursor

cell.1, 35, 38, 39 Utilizing in vitro and in vivo models of human breast cancer, we
demonstrated that: 1) OPN induces MZF1-dependent TGF-β1 production in MSCs to
promote local tumor growth and metastasis, 2) MSCs adopt a CAF phenotype as the result
of autocrine TGF-β1 signaling, and 3) inactivation of extracellular OPN by the OPN-R3
aptamer blocks TGF-β1-mediated MSC-to-CAF transformation and tumor growth and
metastasis. The OPN-MZF1-TGF-β1 signaling pathway has not been previously described.

CAFs are specialized stromal cells with myofibroblast features that promote in vitro cell
proliferation, in vivo tumor growth and facilitate by producing tumor-promoting cytokines
such as CCL5, TNF, IL-6 and SDF1.40, 41 Additionally, CAFs might be a critical niche
component, protecting cancer stem cells; a small proportion of cancer cells responsible for
cancer metastasis, drug resistance and disease relapse; from the effects of chemotherapy.
Small numbers of MSCs, multipotent cells primarily located in bone marrow, can be
detected in other tissues where they may serve as sources of dormant stem cells.42-45 Data
from animal and human breast cancer models suggests that a significant proportion of CAFs
are derived from circulating BM-derived MSCs.46, 47 Thus, eliminating CAFs and/or
repressing the generation of CAFs from local and BM-derived MSCs might be an effective
therapeutic strategy against cancer, especially in combination with standard chemotherapy.

OPN is a ligand for αvβ3 integrin and CD44 receptors.18, 48, 49 Elevated plasma OPN
correlates with increased breast cancer tumor burden, metastasis and prognosis.11, 50-52 OPN
inhibition decreases local breast cancer growth and metastasis.17, 28, 29, 53-55 Therefore,
OPN has been proposed as an anti-cancer target. Studies suggest that OPN-integrin binding
via the RGD domain stimulates tumor cell invasiveness and migration, in part through
activation of MMPs/uPA. On-going research in our lab has identified the likely involvement
of PKA signaling in the OPN-MZF1-TGFβ1 axis. Our current hypothesis is that PKA is
activated downstream of integrin which then leads to MZF1 up-regulation. Further
experiments are underway to test this hypothesis. OPN binds to CD44 to promote cell
survival, chemotaxis, homing and adhesion to enhance metastatic behavior, suggesting a
direct effect of OPN on tumor cells.56-58

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that OPN localizes to the leading edge of
invading tumors, which are enriched in MSC-like cells, suggesting that OPN+ cells interact
in a paracrine fashion with TMEN constituents.59-61 In animal models, OPN produced by
tumor and stromal cells stimulates the incorporation of activated BM-derived cells into
breast tumors, instigating local growth and distant metastases.14, 62 Large numbers of BMMSCs were found in explanted tumors and metastases as shown by GFP+ BM
transplantation studies. By description, this is similar to our findings.17 In xenograft studies
with 4T1(OPN+) murine breast cancer cells (spontaneous metastatic model),63 MSCs
injected into circulating blood selectively localized and proliferated in subcutaneous and
metastatic sites. However, the signaling pathways that underlie OPN-induced MSC
accumulation in tumors remain unknown.

TGF-β autocrine/paracrine signaling loop acts to initiate/maintain this CAF phenotype and
CAFs increase tumor invasion.19, 64-66 The loss of TGF-β1 reverses the growth advantage
imparted by CAFs.67 These studies demonstrated the role of TGF-β signaling in CAF
initiation and maintenance. However, the initiating steps for TGF-β synthesis have never
been addressed. Serendipitously, OPN induces TGF-β expression and fibroblast activation in
models of inflammation and fibrosis.68-75 In the context of carcinogenesis, our findings
indicate that tumor-derived OPN stimulates TGF-β1 production and subsequently the CAF
phenotype in MSCs.

MZF1, originally isolated from a myelogenous leukemia patient, is a Kruppel family
transcription factor containing 13 C2H2 zinc fingers. MZF1 forms a peptide loop that binds
to G-rich DNA consensus sequences.22, 23, 27 Genes regulated by MZF1 identified thus far
include: CD34, lactoferrin, myeloperoxidase, PADI1 and N-cadherin.76 A few reports
identify MZF1 as a tumor suppressor, namely an in vitro cervical cancer model 24 and an in
vivo knockout model 27; however the majority of recent literature supports the oncogenic
nature of MZF1 we describe.23, 25, 26, 76, 77 Expression of MZF1 is associated with the antiapoptotic and oncogenic transformation of cervical (SiHA, HeLa) and colorectal (Rko,
SW480) cancer cell lines.76 3T3 cells transduced with MZF1 lose contact inhibition and
substrate dependence, while undergoing more rapid cell cycling; in athymic mice, these
transduced 3T3 cells form aggressive fibrosarcomas.23 An MZF1 antisense oligonucleotide
inhibits PKCα expression and decreases cell migration and invasion in HCC (SK-Hep1).77
The role of MZF1 in TGF-β1 expression has never been described, but the link to Ncadherin and the overlap between EMT and CAF markers correlates with the role of MZF1
in MSC-to-CAF transformation.

RNA aptamers are short ssRNA oligonucleotides that specifically bind extracellular protein
targets such as OPN.78, 79 Aptamers possess many useful properties as potential therapeutic
molecules: they are small (8-15kD) synthetic compounds with high target affinity
(Kd~0.05-10nM), are heat stable, site-specific modifications can be made to alter
bioavailability and mode of clearance and have minimal interbatch variability. Animal
studies have shown that aptamers are well tolerated, exhibit little immunogenicity and are
likely suitable for repeated administration.78, 79 The aptamer pegaptanib was approved for
treatment of macular degeneration.80 Our work indicates that OPN-R3 APT may serve a role
in targeting CAF phenotype activation.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we have characterized a signaling pathway by which OPN interacts with MSCs
via integrin receptors to up-regulate MZF1-mediated expression of TGF-β1, which results in
conversion of MSCs to a CAF phenotype with promotion of more aggressive local tumor
growth and metastasis. Blockade and inactivation of extracellular OPN by the OPN-R3
aptamer effectively abolishes this pathway. This suggests that OPN blockade may be an
effective clinical strategy for tumor growth inhibition.

Kuperwasser, Tufts University.
Co-culture
1:1 ratio of cancer cells to MSCs were plated in Boyden Chamber (Corning Inc, Corning,
NY) wells with 0.4μm pores that allow cytokine and growth factor passage but prevent cell
movement.
Adhesion and invasion assays

Author Manuscript

Adhesion assays were performed on 96-well plates coated with 10 μg/ml Matrigel. Cells
were trypsinized and re-suspended in DMEM with 1% BSA, 1mM MgCl2, 0.5mM CaCl2 at
1×106 cells/ml. 1×105 cells (100 μl) were added per well and incubated for 30 min at 37°C
in 5% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed (PBS wash with 1mM MgCl2 and 0.5mM
CaCl2). Adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, rinsed with PBS and
stained with 0.4% crystal violet. The dye was released by addition of 30% acetic acid and
plates were read in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 590nm. For
invasion assays, cells were seeded at 105 cells per well in the upper chamber of 12-well
Boyden Chamber transwells (8μm pore). After incubation, cells on the top surface of filters

were removed with cotton swabs. Adherent cells were fixed, dyed and measured as
described above.
Quantitative Real-time PCR
qRT-PCR was performed with the two-step reaction protocol using iQ SYBR Green
detection kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). First-strand cDNA were synthesized
from 1.0 μg of total RNA using the iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Reaction protocol: 25°C for 5 min, 42°C for 30 min, and 85°C for 5 min. The
qRT-PCR parameters were: 95°C for 3 min; 95°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 35 seconds (40
cycles); 95°C for 1 min, and 55°C for 10 min. ΔΔCT was calculated after β-actin
normalization.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Supernatants were analyzed using TGF-β ELISAs (R&D Systems). Measurement of the
active form required no manipulation; total protein measurement required acidification (1N
HCl followed by 1.2N NaOH/0.5M HEPES) prior to assay.
Construction of promoter plasmids

Author Manuscript

Human genomic DNA was isolated from normal human lung fibroblasts (ATCC CCL-210).
TGF-β1 promoter region was defined using NCBI Reference Sequence NM_000660.4. Fulllength promoter (−3360/+124) and deletion constructs (−1196/+124; −691/+124;
−624/+124; −551/+124; −220/+124) were generated by PCR, setting the ATG start site as 0.
All promoter fragments were cloned into pGL4.10(luc2) vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) to
generate luciferase-reporter constructs.

Construction of promoter mutations

Author Manuscript

Point mutations of the TGF-β1 promoter MZF1 putative binding site were made using the
QuikChange II Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
These mutated promoter fragments were cloned into pGL4.10(luc2) vectors and direct
sequencing analysis confirmed.
Dual luciferase reporter assay
4 ug of the luciferase-reporter constructs or empty pGL4.10(luc2) vector were co-transfected
with 0.4 ug of Renilla into MSCs and treated with OPN. After 48 h, using a Dual-Luciferase
assay system (Promega), cells were lysed and promoter activity was measured as a ratio of
Firefly:Renilla luciferase using the Modulus Luminometer (Promega).

ChIP RT-PCR
Cells were treated with OPN and cultured for 48 h prior to DNA cross-linking and lysis.
Chromatin was fixed and immunoprecipitated using the EZ-ChIP assay kit (EMD
Millipore). For the RNA Polymerase II ChIP assay, purified chromatin was
immunoprecipitated using 1 ug of RNA Polymerase Ab or normal mouse IgG (negative
control). For the MZF1 ChIP assay, chromatin was immunoprecipitated using 1 ug of MZF1
Ab, RNA Polymerase Ab (positive control), or normal rabbit IgG (negative control). DNA
was sonicated to 500bp fragments. After DNA purification, RNA polymerase II binding to
the TGF-β1 TATA box and final exon and MZF1 binding to the putative site on the TGF-β1
promoter was determined by qRT-CPR. CT values were normalized to β-actin. Products
from qRT-PCR were run on agarose gel to visualize bands. ChIP RT-PCR primers:

Zymography

Author Manuscript

Gelatin zymography used the Novex Zymogram Gel (Life Technologies) system.
Concentrated serum-free MEM collected from MSC cultures was mixed with sample buffer
and loaded on 10% gel. After running for 1.5 h, the gel was incubated in renaturing buffer
for 30 min at room temperature. After incubating the gel with developing buffer at 37°C
overnight, the gel was stained and images were acquired by AlphaImager 3400 (Protein
Simple, Santa Clara, CA).
Mouse xenograft model
Loyola University’s Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal protocols. Six-weekold female NOD-scid mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were implanted with 106

dual-labeled cancer cells and GFP-MSCs and injected with APT or MuAPT as previously
described.17 After administration of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg), anesthetized mice
(intraperitoneal ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)) were imaged with the IVIS
100 Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Bioluminescence is reported as the sum
of detected photons/second from a constant region of interest. Baseline tumor volume was
established at day 2. Prior to necropsy, D-luciferin was injected to perform ex vivo imaging
of primary, lung and liver tumors.
Fluorescence activated cell sorting
Single cell suspension was prepared as described.82 Cells were sorted using BD
FACSAriaIII (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For GFP, cells were excited using a
488nm laser, with emission collected through a 530/30 bandpass filter. For RFP, cells were
excited using a 561nm laser, with emission collected through a 610/20 bandpass filter.
