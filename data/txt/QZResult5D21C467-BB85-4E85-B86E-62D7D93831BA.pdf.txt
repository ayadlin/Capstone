Abstract
Resistance to currently available targeted therapies signiﬁcantly
hampers the survival of patients with prostate cancer with bone
metastasis. Here we demonstrate an important resistance mechanism initiated from tumor-induced bone. Studies using an
osteogenic patient-derived xenograft, MDA-PCa-118b, revealed
that tumor cells resistant to cabozantinib, a Met and VEGFR-2
inhibitor, reside in a "resistance niche" adjacent to prostate
cancer-induced bone. We performed secretome analysis of the
conditioned medium from tumor-induced bone to identify proteins (termed "osteocrines") found within this resistance niche.
In accordance with previous reports demonstrating that activation of integrin signaling pathways confers therapeutic resistance,
27 of the 90 osteocrines identiﬁed were integrin ligands. We
found that following cabozantinib treatment, only tumor cells
positioned adjacent to the newly formed woven bone remained

viable and expressed high levels of pFAK-Y397 and pTalin-S425,
mediators of integrin signaling. Accordingly, treatment of C4-2B4
cells with integrin ligands resulted in increased pFAK-Y397
expression and cell survival, whereas targeting integrins with FAK
inhibitors PF-562271 or defactinib inhibited FAK phosphorylation and reduced the survival of PC3-mm2 cells. Moreover,
treatment of MDA-PCa-118b tumors with PF-562271 led to
decreased tumor growth, irrespective of initial tumor size. Finally,
we show that upon treatment cessation, the combination of PF562271 and cabozantinib delayed tumor recurrence in contrast to
cabozantinib treatment alone. Our studies suggest that identifying paracrine de novo resistance mechanisms may signiﬁcantly
contribute to the generation of a broader set of potent therapeutic
tools that act combinatorially to inhibit metastatic prostate
cancer. Cancer Res; 75(22); 4949–59. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

of metastatic prostate cancer in bone is the induction of new bone
formation, resulting in bone-forming lesions. This unique tumor
microenvironment likely contributes to resistance to multiple
therapies. However, whether factors from prostate tumor-induced
bone are involved in therapy resistance is unknown.
Recently, cabozantinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor with
potent activity against p-MET and p-VEGFR-2, demonstrated
striking clinical and radiologic responses in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis (4, 5). However, although cabozantinib increased progression-free survival, it
did not lead to improvement in overall survival in a phase 3
clinical trial. Identifying the mechanism(s) of therapy resistance
to cabozantinib and other current drugs for bone metastasis will
lead to the development of strategies to treat this fatal disease.
The current theory whereby patients acquire resistance is
adaptation of tumor cells in response to therapeutic agents.
However, the possibility that prostate tumor-induced changes
in the bone microenvironment may confer "de novo" resistance,
i.e., resistance that occurs prior to treatment with any therapy,
has not been examined previously. In this study, we used
cabozantinib as a study tool to examine the mechanism(s) by
which prostate tumor-induced bone formation confers therapy
resistance. Our studies indicate that prostate cancer-induced
bone provides a "resistance niche" that allows prostate cancer
cells to survive under cabozantinib treatment and perhaps
other targeted therapies.

Development of metastasis in bone is the lethal progression of
prostate cancer. Although several targeted therapeutics have
improved survival of patients with bone metastasis (1, 2), resistance to targeted therapy invariably develops (3). A distinct feature

Materials and Methods
Materials
PC3-mm2 and C4-2B4, human prostate cancer cells, were
maintained in RPMI 1640. HEK-293T cells were maintained in
DMEM. All cell lines were veriﬁed by polymorphic short
tandem repeat loci proﬁling and tested negative for mycoplasma
infection. The patient-derived xenograft (PDX), MDA-PCa-118b
(PCa-118b), was derived from a bone lesion of a patient with
castrate-resistant prostate cancer (6). Cabozantinib (XL184) was
provided by Exelixis. Antibodies were from commercial sources:
pTalin-S425 (ECM), Talin (Millipore), pFAK-Y397 (Invitrogen),
FAK (Cell Signaling), EpCAM (R&D), AE1/AE3 (Dako), penta-His
(Qiagen), mouse osteocalcin, and SPARC (Santa Cruz).
Treatment of PCa-118b tumors with cabozantinib in vivo
PCa-118b PDX was maintained by serial passage in SCID
mice as described (7). SCID mice bearing PCa-118b tumors
were treated with cabozantinib (20 mg/kg) through oral gavage
2/day, 6 days/week. Control mice were administered with
vehicle. Tumor sizes and bone formation were measured by
caliper and X-ray, respectively.
Histology and IHC
PCa-118b tumors were ﬁxed in formalin, decalciﬁed with
formic acid, and embedded in parafﬁn. IHC staining was performed as described (8, 9).
Mass spectrometry analysis of conditioned medium from
tumor-induced bone
PCa-118b tumor was digested with Accumax enzyme mixture
(eBioscience) and cells ﬁltered through a cell strainer. The remaining bone (tumor-induced bone) was cultured in BGJb medium
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for 48 hours. The conditioned media
from tumor-induced bone (Bone-CM) was analyzed by mass
spectrometry (MS) as described (10).
qPCR analysis
Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol and RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Human and mouse integrin
primers, HINT-1 and MINT-1, respectively, were purchased from
RealTimePrimers. GAPDH was used as a control.
Expression and puriﬁcation of osteocrines
RNA from MC3T3-E1 cells was used to generate cDNAs for
osteocrines using primer sequences listed in Supplementary Table
S1. Recombinant osteocrines with His8-tag were expressed from
HEK293 cells using pcDNA3.1 vectors and puriﬁed from conditioned media using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen; ref. 11). cDNAs in
pBMN-I-GFP retroviral vector (12) were used to generate C4-2B4
cells stably expressed osteocrines.
Soft agar colony assay
Soft agar colony assays were performed as described with
modiﬁcations (13). In brief, soft agar colony assay was performed
in a 6-well plate using low melting point agarose. The base layer
was 0.8% agarose and the top layer was 0.48% agarose containing
75,000 C4-2B4-LT cells per well and 10 mg/mL of lumican,
osteopontin, SPARC, BIG-H3, or vitronectin in RPMI medium
without serum. The cells were grown in soft agar for 14 days and
the number of colonies counted. Similarly, in the soft agar assay

4950 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

for the effect of PF562271 on PC3-mm2 cells, various concentration of PF562271 were added to the top layer of agarose
containing 0.1 million cells per well in RPMI containing 0.5%
FBS. PF562271 was replenished daily, 5 days per week. The cells
were grown for 18 days and the number of colonies counted.
Treatment of PCa-118b tumor with PF-562271 in vivo
Mice with PCa-118b tumors grown for 4 to 6 weeks were
grouped according to their tumor sizes as small (30 mm3),
medium (80 mm3), and large (190 mm3). In each group of
four mice, one was treated with vehicle, one with PF-562271
(33 mg/kg), one with cabozantinib (20 mg/kg), and one with
both PF-562271 and cabozantinib, all through oral gavage twice a
day at 8- and 16-hour intervals for 5 days per week. Tumor sizes
were measured weekly. After 2 weeks, treatments were stopped.
Mice in the "large" tumor group were sacriﬁced. Mice in the
"medium" and "small" tumor groups were monitored for tumor
regrowth for either 1 week or 3 weeks. In another study, the
treatments were initiated after the tumors reached palpable sizes.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean  SD unless otherwise stated.
Student t test (two-tailed, paired) was used for statistical analyses.

Results
Cabozantinib inhibits the growth of established osteogenic
PCa-118b tumors
To study resistance speciﬁcally due to osteoblastic metastases,
we use a bone-forming PDX, PCa-118b (6), as a model. PCa-118b
has been shown to induce bone formation even when grown
subcutaneously (6, 7) and PCa-118b tumor has all the cellular
elements present in human bone metastases, including osteoblasts (6).
We ﬁrst determined whether cabozantinib is effective in inhibiting the growth of established PCa-118b tumors. Mice bearing
PCa-118b tumors of various sizes were treated with cabozantinib.
Tumor size measurements showed that regression occurred in all
four tumors at one week after treatment (Fig. 1A, left). Larger
tumors exhibited more pronounced decreases in size (Fig. 1A,
left). When calculated by percentage of tumor shrinkage, all four
tumors showed decreased tumor volume within one week after
cabozantinib treatment (Fig. 1A, right) and these decreases persisted throughout the remaining 3 weeks of treatment (Fig. 1A).
The decrease in tumor sizes may be an underestimate of tumor
shrinkage as there was tumor-induced bone within the tumors
(see Fig. 1B).
Tumor cells adjacent to tumor-induced bone are viable after
treatment
To further examine the effect of cabozantinib on PCa-118binduced bone, X-rays were performed at the onset of treatment
and 4 weeks after treatment (Fig. 1B). No signiﬁcant difference
was observed in the shape of the bone present in the PCa-118b
tumors (Fig. 1B); however, the bone density appeared somewhat
intensiﬁed in the cabozantinib-treated group (Fig. 1B, right). In
addition, decreases in tumor volume were observed in the X-ray
images (Fig. 1B), consistent with the tumor size measurements
(Fig. 1A). Histologic analysis showed that cabozantinib treatment
induced cell death in large areas of the tumors (Fig. 1C). However,
small clusters of viable tumor cells were found, most frequently

adjacent to the tumor-induced bone. Further, osteoblasts rimming the tumor-induced bone were found to be viable (Fig. 1C),
suggesting that PCa-118b-induced osteoblasts are resistant to
killing by cabozantinib treatment. IHC staining for osteocalcin
(an osteoblast marker) and AE1/AE3 (an epithelial cell marker)
showed that the viable tumor cells are located adjacent to osteoblasts (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, PCa-118b tumor cells also express
osteocalcin (Fig. 1C), consistent with the reported osteomimicry
of prostate cancer cells (14, 15). IHC staining of control untreated

suggest that osteoblasts are resistant to cabozantinib and may
protect tumor cells adjacent to the tumor-induced bone from

to grow until the tumors reached approximately 500 mm3. One
group of mice was left untreated (control) and a second group was
treated with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib not only halted tumor
growth but also led to reductions in tumor sizes (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Histologic analyses showed that small clusters of viable
tumor cells were present along with considerable cell death in
cabozantinib-treated tumors at the time cabozantinib treatment
was discontinued (Supplementary Fig. S2A). However, tumors
resumed growth after treatments were discontinued. In tumors
collected 1 or 2 weeks after cabozantinib treatments, robust tumor
regrowth was observed that completely replaced the area of cell
death from prior cabozantinib treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S2B and S2C). IHC analysis showed that cells in the recurrent
tumors are positive for AE1/AE3 epithelial cell markers (Supplementary Fig. S2B), indicating regrowth of cabozantinib-resistant
tumor cells.

Secretome analysis of conditioned medium from tumorassociated bone
Because small clusters of viable tumor cells were found adjacent
to the bone after cabozantinib treatment (Fig. 1C), we hypothesized
that prostate tumor-induced osteoblasts secrete factors that induce
signaling pathways in tumor cells, leading to therapy resistance. We
termed these bone-secreted factors that modulate cellular function
in a paracrine fashion as "osteocrines" ("osteo" ¼ bone; "crine" ¼
paracrines). To identify osteocrines, PCa-118b tumor was digested
with Accumax enzyme mixture to dissociate tumor cells. Tumor
cells were removed and the remaining bone was cultured in BGJb
medium (Fig. 2A). The conditioned media of tumor-associated
bone (Bone-CM) from two independent PCa-118b tumors were
resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, left). SPARC (also known as
osteonectin), a major bone secreted factor, was detected in BoneCM (Fig. 2B, right). MS analyses of Bone-CM identiﬁed 65 and

75 secretory proteins in each sample. Fifty proteins were found in
both samples (Fig. 2C). Together, 90 secretory proteins were identiﬁed (Supplementary Table S2). The most frequently identiﬁed
group of proteins is ligands for integrins (27/90; Supplementary
Table S2). We (16) and others (17–20) have shown that integrin
activation plays a critical role in prostate cancer cell survival.
Additionally, integrin activation has been associated with resistance
to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted agents (21). Thus, the
secreted proteins that are integrin ligands are candidate osteocrines
that may confer therapy resistance to prostate cancer cells.
We employed mouse-speciﬁc primers in qRT-PCR analysis to
conﬁrm the expression of several of these integrin ligands, including ﬁbronectin, laminins, SPARC, SPP1 (osteopontin), BIG-H3
(TGFb induced, TGFbI), tenascin C (TNC), lumican (LUM), and
vitronectin (VTN) in PCa-118b tumors. High levels of messages
for mouse SPARC, SPP1, and lumican and medium levels for
mouse ﬁbronectin, laminins (LAMA3, B1, and C1), and BIG-H3
were observed (Fig. 2D). Because PCa-118b tumors contain both
human PCa-118b cells (22) and mesenchymal cells from mouse
including osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and ﬁbroblasts, we
employed human- and mouse-speciﬁc primers to determine the
origin of the osteocrines. High levels of mouse SPARC and SPP1
messages were found in PCa-118b tumors but not in puriﬁed PCa118b epithelial cells (Fig. 2E), consistent with previous reports
that osteoblasts in PCa-118-induced bone are of mouse origin (6,
7), and the presence of SPARC in the Bone-CM (Fig. 2B). These
observations demonstrate that SPARC, SPP1, and lumican are
secreted from tumor-associated osteoblasts.
Integrins and integrin ligands in PCa-118b tumors

cells. qRT-PCR analysis using human-speciﬁc primers for 16a and
8b integrin subunits showed that PCa-118b tumor cells mainly
express a6, av, and b1 integrins (Fig. 3A). Low levels of other
integrins, including a1, a2, a9, b3, b4, b5, and b8 were also
detected. To conﬁrm that av is expressed in PCa-118b tumor, we
performed RT-PCR using human- or mouse-speciﬁc integrin av
primers on RNAs from isolated PCa-118b cells or PCa-118b
tumors. Human-speciﬁc primers detected av in both isolated
PCa-118b cells and total tumor (Fig. 3B). Mouse-speciﬁc av
primers also detected av in total tumor, suggesting that mouse
cells that were recruited into PCa-118b tumor also expressed av.
Interestingly, av is much more abundantly expressed in PCa-118b
cells relative to PC3-mm2, DU145, and C4-2B cells (Fig. 3B,
right).
The ligands for avb1 are ﬁbronectin, SPP1, and vitronectin,
among others (23, 24). The ligands for a6b1 are laminins (23)
and TNC (25), and others. Fibronectin, TNC, laminins (a1, a4,
b1, and g1), SPP1, lumican, and vitronectin are also detected by
MS (Supplementary Table S2) and by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2D). These
results demonstrate that PCa-118b cells express receptors for the
integrin ligands identiﬁed from the tumor-induced bone.

FAK and Talin phosphorylation are associated with integrin
activation
To examine whether the integrin ligands secreted by the tumorinduced bone activate integrin signaling in PCa-118b tumor, we
examined the phosphorylation of two integrin signaling mediators, focal adhesion kinase (pFAK-Y397) and pTalin-S425
(Fig. 3C; ref. 9), in cabozantinib-treated tumors. Intense staining
of both pFAK-Y397 and pTalin-S425 was observed in viable
tumor cells that are adjacent to the bone (Fig. 3D). These results

Integrin expression in C4-2B4 and PC3-mm2 prostate cancer
cells
To investigate whether integrin signaling confers therapy resistance, we examined the effects of integrin ligands on prostate
cancer cells. Because the PCa-118b cells isolated from PCa-118b
tumors do not survive for more than 2 days in standard culture
conditions (22), C4-2B4 and PC3-mm2 cells were used for this
analysis. qRT-PCR using human-speciﬁc integrin primers showed
that PC3-mm2 cells mainly expressed a5, a6, and b1 integrins
(Fig. 4A). C4-2B4 cells expressed low message levels of integrins
compared with PC3-mm2 and PCa-118b cells, with a5, a6, b1,
and b5 being the major integrins expressed (Fig. 4A). Therefore,
expression of integrins in prostate cancer cells is heterogeneous
and this may lead to varied responses to different integrin ligands
present in the tumor microenvironment.

vector control (Fig. 4D). SPP1 is a ligand for a5b1, avb1, avb3,
avb5, a4b1, and a8b1, and lumican has been shown to be a
ligand for a5b1, avb1, and a2b1. Thus, the effects of these two
osteocrines on C4-2B4 cells are consistent with the expression
of a5 and b1 integrins in C4-2B4 cells. In contrast, addition of
BIG-H3 (a ligand for avb3, avb5, and a6b4 integrins) and
vitronectin (a ligand for avb1 and avb5 integrins) did not have
a signiﬁcant effect on C4-2B4 cell colony formation, likely due to
the low to undetectable levels of expression of av and b1 in C42B4 cells (Fig. 4A). SPARC (osteonectin), which is known as a
counter-adhesive protein (26–29), also did not have a signiﬁcant
effect on C4-2B4 cell colony formation (Fig. 4D). Additionally, we
expressed SPARC, SPP1, lumican, BIG-H3, and vitronectin in C42B4 cells through retroviral transduction. Soft agar colony assays
showed that overexpression of SPP1 or lumican in C4-2B4 cells
led to an increase in cell survival (Supplementary Fig. S3), similar
to the results observed with exogenous addition of puriﬁed
recombinant proteins.

Effect of integrin ligands on C4-2B4 cell survival in vitro
To examine the effects of integrin ligands on C4-2B4 cell
survival, cDNAs encoding SPP1, SPARC, BIG-H3, lumican,
and vitronectin with His8-tags were generated and recombinant
proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4B). Treatment of
C4-2B4 cells with recombinant SPP1 and lumican increased
phosphorylation of FAK-Y397, indicating that these osteocrines
activate integrin signaling (Fig. 4C). Addition of SPP1 or lumican
increased the colony formation of C4-2B4 cells compared with

Effect of FAK inhibitor PF-562271 on PC3-mm2 in vitro
A consequence of integrin activation is phosphorylation of
FAK, which is implicated in cell survival (30). PF-562271 is a
competitive inhibitor for ATP binding to FAK (31), and is undergoing clinical trial (32). We have shown previously that
the integrin signaling pathways are constitutively activated in
PC3-mm2 cells and that FAK is constitutively activated (16).
Therefore, we examined the effect of FAK inhibition on cell
survival. To characterize the effect of PF-562271 on prostate

suggest that osteoblast-secreted integrin ligands likely activate
integrin signaling in tumor cells.

cancer cells, PC3-mm2 cells were ﬁrst treated with PF-562271.
Decreased FAK-Y397 phosphorylation was observed as early as 3
hours and persisted for 24 hours (Fig. 5A), with no change in total
FAK expression. A dose–response analysis showed that treatment
for 24 hours with PF-562271 at greater than 0.1 mmol/L was
sufﬁcient to decrease pFAK-Y397 by 80% in PC3-mm2 cells
(Fig. 5B). Immunoﬂuorescence showed that a 3-hour treatment
with 5 or 10 mmol/L PF-562271 reduced pFAK-Y397 in focal
adhesion sites as well as in the cytosol in PC3-mm2 cells (Fig. 5C,
inset). Although Talin is not a direct target of PF-562271, phosphorylation of Talin-S425 was similarly inhibited, albeit for a
shorter duration and requiring a higher concentration of PF562271 (Fig. 5A and B). These results suggest that PF-562271
effectively inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK-Y397 and TalinS425 in PC3-mm2 cells. We further examined the effect of PF562271 on the survival of PC3-mm2 cells. We observed a dosedependent inhibition of anchorage-independent growth by PF562271 in soft agar colony assays (Fig. 5D).
We next examined the effects of PF-562271 on C4-2B4 cells, in
which the integrin/FAK pathway is not constitutively activated.
C4-2B4 cells were treated with 10 mg/mL SPARC, SPP1, lumican,
BIG-H3, or vitronectin with or without 5 mmol/L PF-562271 and
their growth in soft agar examined. Incubation of C4-2B4 cells
with integrin ligands increased C4-2B4 cell survival (Fig. 5E).
Treatment with PF-562271 signiﬁcantly inhibited the osteocrineinduced C4-2B4 cell survival (Fig. 5E).
Recently, several second-generation FAK inhibitors, including
defactinib (VS-6063 PF-04554878), are being tested in clinical
trials. We thus examined the effects of defactinib on pFAK inhibition in PC3-mm2 cells. Treatment of PC3-mm2 cells with
defactinib led to a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of FAK
phosphorylation similar to that, which was observed with PF562271 (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). Defactinib treatment
also resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of PC3-mm2 cell
survival in soft agar colony formation (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Together, these results suggest that inhibition of FAK activity
decreases prostate cancer cell survival in vitro.
Effect of PF-562271 on tumor growth
Because the expression of pFAK-Y397 was increased in the
resistant tumor cells (Fig. 3D), we reasoned that: (1) inhibition
of FAK activation alone might lead to the decrease of tumor
growth; and (2) a combination of a FAK inhibitor with cabozantinib might reduce the number of resistant cells resulting from
integrin ligand-mediated FAK activation. We ﬁrst examined the
effect of PF-562271 on FAK phosphorylation in vivo. SCID mice
bearing PCa-118b tumors were treated with or without PF562271 for 1, 2, or 5 days. Western blot and immunostaining
showed that pFAK-Y397 was inhibited in the tumor as early as 1
day after treatment with PF-562271 (Fig. 6A and B).
Next, we tested whether PF-562271 is able to inhibit tumor
growth. Mice bearing PCa-118b tumors were grouped according
to tumor sizes: one group with tumors approximately 30 mm3, a
second group with tumors approximately 80 mm3, and a third
group with tumors approximately 190 mm3. Each mouse in the
group was treated with vehicle, PF-562271, cabozantinib, or
cabozantinib in combination with PF-562271. Mouse body
weights in all groups except the cabozantinib alone group
remained similar throughout the course of treatment, suggesting
that there was limited treatment toxicity (Supplementary Fig. S5).

over the initial tumor size (Fig. 6C). We found that PF-562271
treatment alone resulted in an approximately 40% decrease in
tumor size when compared with control, regardless of initial
tumor sizes (Fig. 6C), suggesting that PF-562271 can inhibit
tumor growth. Treatment with cabozantinib or cabozantinib plus

activation in the survival of tumor cells. The combination of
cabozantinib with PF-562271 reduced the levels of pFAK-Y397
in the survived tumor cells compared with cabozantinib alone
(Fig. 6D), although staining was heterogeneous. Importantly, we
found that the tumor cells resistant to PF-562271, cabozantinib,
or combination treatments were Ki67 positive (Fig. 6D), indicating that these tumor cells have the potential to resume their
growth upon cessation of treatments.
Effects of PF-562271 on reducing therapy resistance in
PCa-118b tumor
Next, we examined tumor regrowth after treatment cessation.
After 2 weeks of treatments, tumors in one group of mice were
allowed to re-grow for 1 week and another group for 2 to 3 weeks
after stopping the treatments. Upon cessation of treatments,
cabozantinib-treated tumor re-grew rapidly (Fig. 6E), consistent
with the presence of resistant tumor cells. Treatment with cabozantinib plus PF-562271 delayed tumor regrowth compared with
the tumor regrowth with cabozantinib alone (Fig. 6E), consistent
with the reduction in resistant tumor cells by PF-562271 (Fig. 6D).
Similar results were observed in another set of studies in which
treatments were started as soon as the tumors were palpable
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Together, these results support our
interpretation that cabozantinib eradicates most of the tumor
cells except those adjacent to the bone (Fig. 6F). Cabozantinibresistant cells have higher levels of pFAK, which are sensitive to PF562271 treatment, leading to a delayed tumor recurrence after
treatment cessation in combination therapy compared with those
with cabozantinib alone.

Discussion
Our results suggest that a novel form of "preexisting" or de
novo therapy resistance stems from the osteoblastic nature of
prostate cancer metastasis, in which osteocrines secreted from
tumor-induced bone contribute to therapy resistance. We propose a working model of how the newly formed bone can
induce "de novo" resistance in prostate cancer cells prior to the
initiation of therapy (Fig. 6G). Within the tumor-induced
newly formed woven bone, osteoblasts secrete factors (osteocrines), many of which are integrin ligands that activate integrin
signaling in prostate cancer cells, thus increasing cell survival
and "de novo" therapy resistance. Inhibition of FAK activity
reduces therapy resistance, suggesting that osteocrine-mediated
FAK activation through integrin signaling is one of the de novo
resistance mechanisms.
Increasing evidence demonstrates that integrin-mediated survival pathways play a major role in tumorigenesis and therapy
resistance (17, 20, 33, 34). As a result, several integrin antibodies
are being tested in clinical trials for various cancers (21, 35–37).
We found that C4-2B4, PC3-mm2, and PCa-118b cells express
different panels of integrins. These observations raise concern that
the heterogeneity of integrin expression in prostate cancer cells
may limit the therapeutic efﬁcacy of integrin antibodies. Our
unpublished data support such a possibility. We examined the
anti-integrin b1 antibody mAb 33B6 (16) in combination with
DI17E6, an anti-integrin av antibody that has been tested in phase
1 clinical trials (35), on PCa-118b tumor growth. We found that,
when tested in established PCa-118b tumors, the combination of
mAb 33B6 and DI17E6 did not show a signiﬁcant inhibition of
tumor growth (data not shown). These antibodies also did not

www.aacrjournals.org

signiﬁcantly reduce resistance to cabozantinib treatment in the
PCa-118b model (data not shown). These results may be due to a
failure in blocking a6 integrin that is highly expressed in PCa118b cells. As most integrins signal through FAK, inhibiting pFAK
may be a strategy to overcome the heterogeneity in integrin
expression in tumor cells. In addition to PF-562271 (38), several
FAK inhibitors, e.g., VS-6063 (defactinib, PF-04554878) and VS4718, are currently being tested in clinical trials. Although our
studies showed that PF-562271 is able to reduce PCa-118b growth
as a single agent and improve the therapy outcomes when
combined with cabozantinib, PF-562271 may not be suitable
for clinical application. PF-562271 exhibits potent inhibition of
CYP3A, leading to dose- and time-dependent nonlinearity in PF562271 pharmacokinetics (32). As a result, second-generation
FAK inhibitors VS-6063 and VS-4718 may be better agents than
PF-562271 in clinical application.
Although integrin signals through FAK, FAK is also known to be
activated by many growth factor receptors in various types of
human cancer (for review, see ref. 39). Thus, FAK activation in the
tumor cells that are resistant to cabozantinib treatments may also
be due to integrin-independent signaling pathways other than by
integrin activation. As a result, FAK inhibitors may be used in
therapy resistance arising from pathways other than integrin.
Besides integrin activation, osteocrines may also be involved in
other resistance mechanisms. Several of the identiﬁed osteocrines,
e.g., periostin and tenascin C, have been shown to regulate
maintenance of cancer stem cell-like properties in other solid
tumor types (40, 41). Interestingly, FAK is also a survival factor for
cancer stem cells (42). FAK has been shown to play a role in selfrenewal, tumorigenicity, and maintenance of mammary cancer
stem cells (42). Shapiro and colleagues (43) showed that FAK
inhibitor treatment preferentially eliminates cancer stem cells.
Thus, the combination of a FAK inhibitor with chemotherapy may
also eliminate cancer stem cells that are resistant to chemotherapy.
Other nonintegrin osteocrines may also confer resistance through
different mechanisms. These osteocrines together may contribute
to therapy resistance in human prostate cancer bone metastasis.
Recently, it was reported that vascular heterogeneity may represent another source of primary therapy resistance (44). Systematic
dissection of tumor–microenvironment interactions may reveal
other important mechanisms underlying therapy resistance.
Investigations into the various mechanisms of resistance from
tumor microenvironment may lead to different therapy combinations that further overcome resistance.
In addition to targeting the osteocrine-mediated resistance
pathways in the tumor cells, another approach would be to target
the release of osteocrines from osteoblasts. Thus, it is possible that
the bone-targeting agents, e.g., radium-223 (Alpharadin), could
be considered for preventing therapy resistance from tumorinduced bone. Radium-223 dichloride is a bone-seeking, a-emitting radionuclide that has been shown to result in increased
overall survival, i.e., 3.6 months (45, 46), and has received FDA
approval. As the mechanism of resistance we have identiﬁed is
therapy-independent, we predict that these bone-targeting agents
may also be effective in preventing therapy resistance from the
bone microenvironment by blocking the release of osteocrines
when used in combination with numerous therapeutic agents
approved or in clinical trial for bone-metastatic prostate cancer.
In summary, we identify for the ﬁrst time that factors secreted
from tumor-induced bone constitutes one type of microenvironment-mediated therapy resistance. Although cabozantinib was

used in this study, our studies identify a novel mechanism of de
novo therapy resistance from tumor-induced bone that leads to
resistance prior to any therapy application. Our observations
suggest that pathways mediating such resistance need to be
targeted simultaneously with therapeutic regimens for bone
metastasis. As bone metastasis is the lethal progression of prostate
cancer, strategies that combine inhibitors of preexisting therapy
resistance with currently approved drugs may improve therapy
outcomes and prolong patient survival.
