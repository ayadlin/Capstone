Abstract
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have emerged as essential
players in cancer biology. Using recent large-scale RNA-seq datasets, especially those from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
we have developed "The Atlas of Noncoding RNAs in Cancer"
(TANRIC; http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/TANRIC:
Overview), a user-friendly, open-access web resource for interactive exploration of lncRNAs in cancer. It characterizes the expression proﬁles of lncRNAs in large patient cohorts of 20 cancer
types, including TCGA and independent datasets (>8,000 samples
overall). TANRIC enables researchers to rapidly and intuitively

analyze lncRNAs of interest (annotated lncRNAs or any userdeﬁned ones) in the context of clinical and other molecular data,
both within and across tumor types. Using TANRIC, we have
identiﬁed a large number of lncRNAs with potential biomedical
signiﬁcance, many of which show strong correlations with established therapeutic targets and biomarkers across tumor types or
with drug sensitivity across cell lines. TANRIC represents a valuable
tool for investigating the function and clinical relevance of lncRNAs
in cancer, greatly facilitating lncRNA-related biologic discoveries
and clinical applications. Cancer Res; 75(18); 3728–37. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Recent RNA-seq data over large cancer patient cohorts provide
an unprecedented opportunity to pursue that inquiry in a systematic way. In particular, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
represents a unique resource as it generates multidimensional
data at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels for a broad range of
human tumor types (10). However, there are several computational challenges for biomedical researchers to make full use of
these data and prioritize lncRNAs for further functional investigations. First, the number of expressed lncRNAs in human cancers is
large. For example, a very recent pan-cancer analysis reveals
approximately 8,000 tumor-speciﬁc or lineage-speciﬁc lncRNAs
(11). In terms of prioritizing lncRNAs with potential clinical
relevance and elucidating their mechanisms, it is very informative
to perform the correlation analysis of lncRNA expression with
clinical variables (e.g., patient survival) or with the molecular
characteristics of driver genes or therapeutic targets (e.g., PTEN
loss or HER2 status) over large patient cohorts. But because of
high dimension and complexity of the data involved, such analyses are often daunting and time-consuming. Second, the annotation of lncRNAs in the human genome is rough, very incomplete
and fast evolving, so it is important for researchers to be able to
query the expression proﬁles of user-deﬁned lncRNAs (based on
genomic coordinates). This function is not available in current
lncRNA-related bioinformatics resources as it requires the calculation directly from a huge amount of raw RNA-seq mapping ﬁles.
Third, given lncRNA candidates of interest, it is critical to examine
their proﬁles in a variety of cancer cell lines, which allows
researchers to choose appropriate model systems for experimental
studies. Unfortunately, efﬁcient bioinformatics tools with the
above functions are still missing, representing a major barrier for
the cancer research community to a systems-level understanding
of the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNAs.
To ﬁll the gap, we have developed The Atlas of Noncoding RNAs
in Cancer (TANRIC), a user-friendly, open resource for interactive
exploration of lncRNAs in the context of TCGA clinical and

The human genome encodes approximately 20,000 proteincoding genes and also a large number of transcriptionally active,
noncoding RNAs (14,000 according to the ENCODE annotation; ref. 1). Among noncoding RNAs, long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNA), typically >200 bp, have increasingly been recognized as
playing essential roles in tumor biology, representing a new focus
in cancer research (2–4). Emerging evidence has indicated that
lncRNAs contribute to tumor initiation and progression through
diverse mechanisms ranging from epigenetic regulation of key
cancer genes (5, 6) and enhancer-associated activity (7) to posttranscriptional processing of mRNAs (8, 9). Therefore, central
tasks in cancer research are the identiﬁcation of lncRNA components involved in carcinogenesis and elucidation of their functions in speciﬁc tumor contexts. That inquiry is expected to lay the
foundation for development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic
agents.

genomic data. Using TANRIC, we have demonstrated that a large
number of lncRNA species show differential expression among
known tumor subtypes or in correlation with clinical variables;
many lncRNAs show strong correlations with established therapeutic targets and biomarkers across tumor types or with drug
sensitivity across cell lines; and the tumor subtypes deﬁned by
lncRNA-expression proﬁles show extensive concordance with
established tumor subtypes and provide potential prognostic
value.

(OV), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), and uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma
(UCEC). We also downloaded 739 BAM ﬁles of Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE) cell lines (12) from CGHub. In addition,
we obtained the RNA-seq ﬁles of 531 samples from another
three independent studies, including LUAD (13), clear-cell
renal cell carcinoma (14), and glioblastomas (15). In total, the
current TANRIC release includes RNA-seq data from 8,143
samples (1,142 billion reads).

Materials and Methods
Data resource
We downloaded RNA-seq BAM ﬁles of 6,309 patient samples
(including 6,083 primary tumor samples and 226 metastasis
samples) across 20 TCGA cancer types and their related 564
non-tumor tissue samples (if available; ref. 10) from the UCSC
Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub, https://cghub.ucsc.edu/).
Included were bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), brain
lower-grade glioma (LGG), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA),
cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney
renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous
cell carcinoma (LUSC), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma

Efﬁcient algorithm for expression quantitation of user-deﬁned
lncRNAs
To calculate the expression of a user-deﬁned lncRNA, TANRIC
accepts the genomic coordinates of multiple segments as the
input (e.g., given a lncRNA of 3 exons, the input could
be "chr7:27135713–27136007;27138458–27138985;27139398–
27139585"). The total exon length of a queried lncRNA should
be shorter than 50 kb. To minimize the computation time for
quantifying user-deﬁned lncRNA expression, we preprocessed
all raw BAM ﬁles through three steps: (i) extraction of sequence
depth data from raw BAM ﬁles using SAMtools; (ii) division of
genome-wide depth data into short segments (3,000,000 bp);
(iii) merged of the data into a single ﬁle, thereby minimizing
the ﬁle input/output time when dealing with hundreds of samples
for each cancer type; (iv) compression of the merged depth ﬁles
using a block compression algorithm; and (v) generation of

corresponding index ﬁles for quick location and retrieval of
queried data. We quantiﬁed the lncRNA expression as reads per
kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM; ref. 16) and generated
the expression proﬁle in a dynamic table. With data preprocessing,
the time for calculating lncRNA expression was reduced by >100fold compared with that of SAMtools. Currently, TANRIC, operating single threaded, can generate the expression proﬁle for any
user-deﬁned lncRNA in a minute. That capability dramatically
improves performance, enabling rapid analysis of speciﬁed
lncRNAs through a web interface.
Implementation of the TANRIC data portal
The expression data on annotated lncRNAs and the precalculated correlations with clinical and genomic data are stored in
CouchDB. Correlation, differential analyses, and survival analyses
were performed in R. The Web interface was implemented in
JavaScript; tables were visualized by DataTables; the embedded
plots were based on HighCharts; and heat maps were generated
using the Next-Generation Clustered Heat Map tool (Broom,
Weinstein and colleagues; unpublished data).
Expression quantitation of annotated lncRNAs
To perform a comprehensive survey of human lncRNAs, we
obtained the genomic coordinates of 13,870 human lncRNAs
from the GENCODE Resource (version 19; ref. 1). We further
ﬁltered those lncRNA exons that overlapped with any known
coding genes based on the gene annotations of GENCODE (1)
and RefGene. As a result, the analysis focused on the remaining
12,727 lncRNAs. On the basis of the BAM ﬁles, we quantiﬁed
the expression levels of lncRNAs as RPKM, and the lncRNAs
with detectable expression were deﬁned as those with an
average RPKM  0.3 across all samples in each cancer type,
as deﬁned in the literature (17).

Analysis of expressed lncRNAs for biomedical signiﬁcance
We obtained the clinical information associated with tumor
samples, including the patient's overall survival time, tumor stage,
and tumor grade from Synapse TCGA Pan-Cancer data portal
(https://www.synapse.org/), with ID syn300013. We also
obtained known tumor subtype information from TCGA marker
articles (if available). To identify lncRNAs differentially expressed
between tumors and matched normal samples, we used the paired
Student t test to assess the statistical difference between the two
groups. To identify lncRNAs differentially expressed among established tumor subtypes or tumor stages, we used ANOVA to assess
the statistical difference. Groups with fewer than ﬁve samples were
excluded from the analysis.
Analysis of lncRNA expression related to potential clinical
applications
We obtained a list of 121 actionable target genes from Van Allen
and colleagues (18) and added two genes that are well-established
targets in immune therapy. We downloaded TCGA molecular proﬁling data of these target genes, including somatic mutations, mRNA
expression, miRNA expression, and somatic copy-number alteration (SCNA) data from Synapse TCGA Pan-Cancer data portal.
Student t tests were used to assess the statistical difference in lncRNA
expression between mutated and wild-type samples given a gene of
interest, and Spearman rank correlations were used to assess relationships between lncRNA expression and SCNA or mRNA, with a
coefﬁcient (absolute value) cutoff of 0.6. Multiple comparisons
correction was performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg method
with a corrected false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05, and a
2-fold change between at least two groups was also required. To
assess the effects of lncRNA expression on drug sensitivity, we
downloaded the drug screening data from CCLE (http://www.
broadinstitute.org/ccle/home), and calculated the correlations
between the expression levels of approximately 1,290 expressed

Analysis of tumor subtypes revealed by lncRNA expression
To classify tumor subtypes based on lncRNA expression, for
each cancer type, we selected the 500 lncRNAs with the most
variable expression pattern and used ConsensusClusterPlus
(19) to classify the tumor samples into sample clusters (subtypes). We then used the c2 test to determine concordance
between lncRNA-expression subtypes and known subtypes, and
the log-rank test to examine whether lncRNA-expression subtypes signiﬁcantly correlated with the overall patient survival
times. To understand the molecular mechanisms associated
with lncRNA subtypes, we downloaded reverse-phase protein
array (RPPA) expression data from The Cancer Proteome Atlas
(20). Pathway analysis was conducted as previously described
(21). Brieﬂy, the members of each pathway were predeﬁned on

3732 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

the basis of a literature search. RPPA data were median-centered
and normalized by SD across all samples for each component
to obtain relative protein levels. The pathway score was then
taken as the sum of the relative protein levels of all positive
regulatory components minus the equivalent sum for the
negative regulatory components in a particular pathway. Antibodies targeting different phosphorylated forms of the same
protein with Pearson correlation coefﬁcient >0.85 were averaged. We used a Student t test or ANOVA analysis to assess
statistical differences in pathway score among groups, using the
Benjamini–Hochberg correction, with FDR cutoff of 0.05.

datasets from TCGA and other, independent studies and have
made processed lncRNA expression data plus multiple analysis
and visualization modules available through TANRIC (http://
bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/TANRIC:Overview; Fig. 1).
This data release, which covers 8,143 samples, has three parts
(Table 1). (i) Part one consists of TCGA tissue sample sets: 6,309
tumor samples from 20 cancer types and 564 normal samples
from 11 tissues. Other TCGA cancer sets will be added in the
coming months. (ii) Part two consists of independent tumor
tissue sample sets: one GBM set (274 samples; ref. 15), one KIRC
set (97 samples; ref. 14), and one LUAD set (83 samples; ref. 13).
Other independent sample sets will be added when available. (iii)
Part three consists of tumor cell lines: 739 cell line samples from
CCLE (12). To our knowledge, this represents the largest publicly
available collection of lncRNA data with parallel multidimensional cancer genomic data.
TANRIC integrates lncRNA expression data with clinical and
genomic data (Fig. 1) and provides a user-friendly interface
consisting of six modules: Summary, Visualization, Download,

(Fig. 2,i). The "Summary" module shows an overview of RNAseq datasets in TANRIC with a detailed description of each set
(e.g., source, read length, sequencing platform, and sequencing
strategy; Fig. 2,ii). The "Visualization" module offers an innovative way to examine the global patterns of lncRNA expression in a speciﬁc sample set through "next-generation clustered
heat maps" (Fig. 2,iii). The interactive heat maps allow users to
zoom, navigate, and drill down on clustering patterns (subtypes) of samples or lncRNAs and link to relevant biologic
information sources. The "Download" module allows users to
obtain the expression data of approximately 13,000 annotated
lncRNAs for analysis (Fig. 2, iv; Materials and Methods).
TANRIC provides three analysis modules that enable users to
examine the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNAs in
a ﬂexible, interactive way. The "My lncRNA" module provides
detailed information about one lncRNA of interest in a userspeciﬁed patient sample set. With the module, users can obtain

examine whether the lncRNA shows differential expression
between tumor and normal samples or among tumor subgroups

(as visualized through the box plots, Fig. 2,vi) or whether it
correlates with patient survival time (based on P values from the
univariate Cox proportional hazards model and log-rank test and
visualization through a Kaplan–Meier plot, Fig. 2,vi). This module also enables users to examine the correlations of the lncRNA
with various molecular data for protein-coding and miRNA
genes. The data types include SCNAs, mRNA expression, miRNA
expression, protein expression (as visualized through the scatter
plots in Fig. 2,vii) and somatic mutations (as visualized through
the box plots, Fig. 2,vii). For example, elevated BCAR4 expression
has been shown to signiﬁcantly correlate with shorter survival
time of breast cancer patients (22); and HOTAIR, a well-studied
lncRNA, is known to be coexpressed with HOXC genes (23).
Through this module, these ﬁndings can be easily conﬁrmed on
the basis of TCGA cohorts. Because the annotation of lncRNAs is

3734 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

still rough and incomplete, this module also allows for the query
of any user-deﬁned lncRNA or its isoform (based on genomic
coordinates) and returns the analysis results. The "Analyze all
lncRNAs" module allows users to analyze approximately 13,000
ENCODE-annotated RNAs in a user-speciﬁed patient sample set.
With this module, users can easily identify the most differentially
expressed lncRNAs among tumor subtypes or those with the
strongest correlations with patient survival times (Fig. 2,vi). Given
a known coding/miRNA gene of interest, this module helps
identify those lncRNAs with the strongest associations for various
types of molecular data (Fig. 2,vi). The results are presented in a
table, and users can search the results by lncRNA name, rank the
correlations, and visually examine the details. The "lncRNAs in
cell lines" module provides analyses similar to those in "My
lncRNA," but in sets based on cell lines. It can help users identify

the TANRIC portal, users can perform extensive analyses on
lncRNAs, both within and across tumor types and obtain publication-quality ﬁgures in a convenient way.
A large number of lncRNAs with potential biomedical
signiﬁcance across cancer types
Using the data and analysis modules available at TANRIC, we
performed a comprehensive survey to assess the potential biomedical signiﬁcance of lncRNAs. First, for 12 TCGA cancer types
with available non-tumor samples, we found large numbers of
lncRNAs with signiﬁcant differential expression between tumor
and matched normal samples (paired t test; FDR < 0.05; fold
change 2; Fig. 3A). As an independent validation, 81% of the
differentially expressed lncRNAs identiﬁed in the TCGA LUAD set
were conﬁrmed in a Korean sample set (13). Second, for 11 TCGA
cancer types with established biologic or molecular subtypes
(Supplementary Table S1), we found considerable numbers of
differentially expressed lncRNAs among the known tumor subtypes (t test or ANOVA; FDR < 0.05; fold change 2 in at least two
groups; Fig. 3B), and those lncRNAs may play a role in deﬁning
tumor heterogeneity within a cancer type. Third, for eight TCGA
cancer types with sufﬁcient samples available across different
disease stages (tumor stages I–IV), we identiﬁed some lncRNAs
for which the expression patterns correlated with disease stage.
Some showed a monotonic change [e.g., 71 and 41 in kidney clear
cell cancer (KIRC) and KIRP, ANOVA analysis, FDR < 0.05, fold
change 2 in at least two groups; Fig. 3C]. Those lncRNAs may be
involved in tumor progression. Across the above three analyses,
we demonstrate an abundance of lncRNAs with potential biomedical relevance, and many of the lncRNAs show signiﬁcance in
more than one cancer type (Fig. 3D).
To examine the potential impact of lncRNAs on clinical practice, we focused on 123 clinically actionable genes (18). According
to their clinical utility, we classiﬁed the genes into four groups:
(i) therapeutic targets with FDA drugs approved for cancer treatment; (ii) therapeutic targets with drugs in late-stage clinical
trials; (iii) therapeutic targets with drugs in early-stage clinical

trials; and (iv) other established diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers (Supplementary Table S2). We then examined the correlations between the expressed lncRNAs and the actionable
genes, and found considerable numbers of lncRNAs strongly
correlated with one or more targets in terms of (i) differential
expression between samples with wild-type and mutated genes
(t test, FDR < 0.05, and fold change 2); (ii) in correlation
with SCNAs (Spearman rank correlation j Rs j > 0.6); and
(iii) in correlation with mRNA expression (Spearman rank correlation j Rs j > 0.6; Fig. 4A). Focusing on strongly correlated
lncRNA-target pairs, we found that many of the pairs are consistently identiﬁed in multiple TCGA cancer types (Fig. 4B). These
results highlight the potential of lncRNAs as regulators of key
therapeutic targets for clinical practice.
To explore the potential effects of lncRNAs on drug sensitivity, we identiﬁed the expressed lncRNAs in the CCLE cell
lines (12) and examined their correlations with the sensitivity
data (IC50) of 24 drugs available. Interestingly, we found 202
lncRNA–drug pairs with signiﬁcant correlations (Spearman
rank correlation j Rs j > 0.3 and FDR < 0.01; Fig. 4C). These
results suggest a critical role of some lncRNAs in affecting
the response of cancer therapies.
Biologic and clinical relevance of tumor subtypes revealed by
lncRNA expression
Finally, we examined the clinical relevance of tumor subtypes
revealed by TCGA lncRNA expression proﬁles. On the basis of the
top 500 lncRNAs with the most variable expression, we deﬁned
sample subtypes (sample clusters) by ConsensusClusterPlus
(Materials and Methods; ref. 19). For each of the TCGA cancer
types we studied, lncRNA-expression subtypes show extensive,
strong concordance with established subtypes (c2 test; P < 0.05;
FDR < 0.05; Fig. 5A). For example, lncRNA subtype 1 in breast
cancer (BRCA) almost exclusively corresponds to the basal subtype; lncRNA subtype 5 in HNSC primarily corresponds to HPVnegative tumors; and lncRNA subtype 1 in endometrial cancer
(UCEC) mainly represents the high copy-number molecular subtype (24). We next assessed the prognostic value of lncRNA-

expression subtypes. For BRCA, HNSC, KIRC, and brain LGG, the
lncRNA-expression subtypes show distinct patient survival proﬁles
(log-rank test, P < 0.05, Fig. 5B). As an independent validation, the
three lncRNA-expression subtypes in another independent KIRC
cohort (14) also show a signiﬁcant correlation with the overall
patient survival times (Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, given
clinical variables (i.e., disease stage and tumor grade), the lncRNA
subtypes confer additional prognostic power in BRCA and KIRC
(multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, P < 0.05).
To explore molecular mechanisms associated with the tumor
subtypes deﬁned by lncRNA expression, we examined whether
some biologic pathways showed some differential expression
among the tumor subtypes based on pathway scores calculated
from TCGA protein expression data (21). We found that the
tumor subtypes deﬁned by lncRNA expression (Fig. 5A) are
associated with activation or inhibition of some pathways (Fig.
5C). These results suggest that lncRNA expression represents one
meaningful dimension; therefore, integrating lncRNA expression
with other molecular data may help characterize the molecular
basis of human cancer more fully.

Discussion
We have developed TANRIC, a user-friendly, interactive, openaccess web resource for exploring the functions and mechanisms
of lncRNAs in cancer. Compared with other available lncRNAfocused bioinformatics resources (11, 25–34), TANRIC has several unique features (Table 2): (i) It provides extensive, intuitive,
and interactive analyses on lncRNAs of interest for their interactions with other TCGA genomic/proteomic/epigenomic and clinical data types, both within a tumor type and across tumor types;
(ii) it enables users to query expression proﬁles of user-deﬁned
lncRNAs quickly; (iii) it includes RNA-seq data from well-characterized cell lines and other large, non-TCGA patient cohorts,
thereby allowing users to validate a pattern of interest or identify
model cell lines for experimental characterization. With the
efﬁcient analytic modules, TANRIC substantially lowers the barriers between cancer researchers and complex cancer transcriptomic data (>60TB and 1,142 billion reads in the current release).
Going forward, we will constantly incorporate newly available
large-scale cancer RNA-seq data into TANRIC.
We have further demonstrated the utility of TANRIC through a
comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of expressed lncRNAs. Consistent with previous studies (4, 11, 35, 36), our analysis revealed a

large number of tumor-associated lncRNAs. More importantly, we
report that some lncRNAs show strong correlations with established therapeutic targets across tumor types or with drug sensitivity across cell lines. Although the correlations do not necessarily
indicate direct cause–effect relationships, they highlight the
potential of lncRNAs as a novel class of biomarkers or therapeutic
targets. TANRIC, thus, represents a starting point for exploration
of particular lncRNA species and for generation of testable
hypotheses for further experimental investigation.
