ABSTRACT
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process in embryonic
development and has been associated with cancer metastasis and drug resistance.
For example, in EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), EMT has been
associated with acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Moreover, “EGFRaddicted” cancer cell lines induced to undergo EMT become erlotinib-resistant in
vitro. To identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities specifically within these
mesenchymal, erlotinib-resistant cells, we performed a small molecule screen of ~200
established anti-cancer agents using the EGFR mutant NSCLC HCC827 cell line and
a corresponding mesenchymal derivative line. The mesenchymal cells were more
resistant to most tested agents; however, a small number of agents showed selective
growth inhibitory activity against the mesenchymal cells, with the most potent being
the Abl/Src inhibitor, dasatinib. Analysis of the tyrosine phospho-proteome revealed
several Src/FAK pathway kinases that were differentially phosphorylated in the
mesenchymal cells, and RNAi depletion of the core Src/FAK pathway components
in these mesenchymal cells caused apoptosis. These findings reveal a novel role for
Src/FAK pathway kinases in drug resistance and identify dasatinib as a potential
therapeutic for treatment of erlotinib resistance associated with EMT.

INTRODUCTION

studies have demonstrated small populations of “cancer
stem cells” which appear to be intrinsically resistant to
anti-cancer agents, possibly reflecting elevated drug efflux
potential, as has been associated with normal stem cells
[3, 4]. In addition, in several studies of kinase-addicted
TKI-sensitive cells, “switching” to an alternative kinase
dependency has been observed, highlighting the extensive
cross-talk among pathways that drive cancer cell survival
and the potential for signal redundancy [5, 6].
EMT, a non-genetically determined process
observed within tumor cell populations, has also been
associated with resistance to various cancer therapeutics,
including TKIs [7-9]. In an EGFR mutant NSCLC
patient’s tumor biopsy, a subpopulation of mesenchymal
tumor cells was identified, which subsequently appeared
to give rise to resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy [1].
To model EMT in vitro, numerous experimental strategies

Modeling of acquired drug resistance in vitro using
tumor-derived cell lines has provided critical insights
into the numerous mechanisms underlying the drug
resistance that is typically observed in cancer patients
undergoing treatment with various kinase-targeted agents.
Such studies have revealed several specific genetic
mechanisms of acquired drug resistance that have been
observed clinically [1, 2]. More recently, non-mutational
mechanisms of drug resistance have also been identified.
For example, pre-existing EGFR (Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor) inhibitor-resistant cell populations have
been observed in vitro within a population of EGFR
mutant NSCLC cells, indicating heterogeneity within
cancer cell populations, including a transiently maintained
“drug tolerant persister” (DTP) subpopulation [2]. Other

have been utilized [10-12], and TGF-β-induced EMT has
been demonstrated to promote resistance to TKIs [13].
Maintenance of the mesenchymal state following EMT
can be regulated by paracrine and autocrine signals [12],
and growth factors derived from tumor cells themselves or
the tumor stroma have been shown to promote resistance
to TKIs through kinase dependency switching [5, 6].
Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as AXL
has been observed in the context of EMT-associated
drug resistance, however, the functional role of AXL in
resistance to TKIs remains controversial [9, 14-16].
In this study we sought to identify potential
therapeutic vulnerabilities specifically within the
mesenchymal, TKI-resistant cell population. Using a
small molecule screening strategy, we observed that
the mesenchymal cells are broadly resistant to a variety
of anti-cancer agents, including several TKIs and
chemotherapeutic drugs. However, a small number of
agents showed selective growth inhibitory activity against
the mesenchymal cells. Dasatinib, an inhibitor of ABL and
SRC tyrosine kinases, was the most potent of the tested
agents, and additional studies revealed a role for Src/FAK
pathway kinases in EMT-associated drug resistance.

we sought to determine whether the E-Cadherin-positive
subpopulation within the TGF-β-treated population
was sensitive to erlotinib by FACS-sorting these cell
populations based on E-Cadherin expression (Figure 1H).
The FACS-sorted E-Cadherin-positive population was
erlotinib-sensitive and exhibited comparable sensitivity to
the parental unsorted population, while the E-Cadherinnegative/low population was erlotinib-resistant (Figure
1I). The FACS sorted E-Cadherin-positive population was
further exposed to TGF-β, and subsequently underwent
EMT, however, this population of cells maintained an
E-Cadherin-positive subpopulation of 30-40% (data not
shown). Since the TGF-β-treated HCC827 cell population
display characteristics of mesenchymal cells, they are
hereafter referred to as HCC827 mesenchymal (MES)
cells.
We next sought to determine the mechanism of
drug resistance following EMT. We first established that
erlotinib resistance was independent of drug efflux, as we
observed a comparable suppression of phosphorylation
of EGFR in the mesenchymal (MES) and the parental
(PAR) cells (Figure 2A). TGF-β has both pro-apoptotic
and anti-apoptotic properties [18]; therefore, we tested the
possibility that recombinant TGF-β was directly promoting
erlotinib resistance. Parental HCC827 cells were coexposed to erlotinib and TGF-β in a 72h viability assay,
and there were no detectable differences in the erlotinib
IC50 (Figure 2B). In addition, cells that were induced to
undergo EMT were insensitive to treatment with a TGF-β
receptor 1 inhibitor, SB-431542, and co-treatment with
erlotinib did not further sensitize the erlotinib-resistant
mesenchymal (MES) cells (Figure 2C).
Mesenchymal cells secrete a variety of growthpromoting factors to maintain their mesenchymal
state [12], and growth factor-driven resistance has
been associated with TKIs, including erlotinib [5, 6].
Therefore, we determined whether conditioned media
from HCC827 mesenchymal cells promoted erlotinib
resistance upon treatment of the parental cells (Figure 2D).
Conditioned media from HCC827 mesenchymal (MES)
cells was sufficient to initiate EMT, as indicated by loss
of E-Cadherin and gain in expression of Snail in parental
HCC827 (PAR) cells; however, vimentin was not detected,
indicating that prolonged exposure to conditioned media
may be required to promote a complete EMT. However
the cells remained sensitive to erlotinib, as indicated by
PARP cleavage in a 3-day assay (Figure 2D).
To examine the reversibility of the induced EMT,
we sought to determine whether the derived mesenchymal
cells would spontaneously revert to a drug-sensitive
epithelial phenotype, which would also be indicative of
a non-mutational resistance mechanism. We confirmed
that these cells were able to revert to an epithelial
phenotype upon withdrawal of TGF-β (TGF-β WD) for
10 days (Figure 2E), with restored sensitivity to erlotinib
(Figure S1). Considering the reversible nature of the EMT

RESULTS
RTK-addicted cancer cell lines become TKIresistant upon EMT
Using continuous TGF-β treatment to promote EMT,
we experimentally induced EMT in the HCC827 EGFR
mutant NSCLC cell line, with previously established
sensitivity to the EGFR TKI erlotinib [17]. Exposure of
HCC827 cells to recombinant TGF-β for several days
resulted in the expected EMT, as assessed by loss of
E-Cadherin and gain in vimentin expression (Figure 1A).
A mesenchymal phenotype in these treated cells was
additionally confirmed by demonstrating their increased
invasion capacity (Figure 1B). Next, we compared
drug sensitivity of the parental epithelial cells and their
mesenchymal derivatives (in the absence of TGF-β). Upon
induction of EMT, the HCC827 cells became significantly
more resistant to erlotinib (Figure 1 C&D). Erlotinib
exposure specifically failed to induce caspase-3/7 activity
(Figure 1E) and PARP cleavage (Figure 1F) (markers of
apoptosis) in the mesenchymal cells.
Notably, the mesenchymal cells derived following
TGF-β exposure were not completely erlotinib-resistant,
and 40% of this cell population remained sensitive to
drug (Figure 1D). Consistent with that observation,
immunofluorescence imaging revealed a subpopulation of
epithelial cells (E-Cadherin-positive) within the TGF-βinduced “mesenchymal” population, indicating that not all
of the cells had undergone EMT (Figure 1G). Therefore,

process, we next examined whether the induced EMT was
epigenetically regulated. Treatment with the chromatinmodifying agents, MS-275 and Romidespin, both HDAC
(histone deacetylase) inhibitors, blocked the EMT process
(Figure 2F). These findings demonstrate that the resistance
to erlotinib upon EMT is independent of drug efflux,
exogenous TGF-β, or secreted growth factors, and is
reversibly established through an epigenetic mechanism.

undertook an unbiased drug sensitivity screen using
a panel of 174 established and investigational anticancer agents. This analysis revealed that the HCC827
mesenchymal cells were selectively resistant to a variety
of other anti-cancer agents, with varying degrees in shift
of IC50 values relative to the parental cells (Table 1 &
S1). However, we did observe that the mesenchymal
cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to dasatinib, a
dual Abl/Src kinase inhibitor, and not to other distinct
ABL/Src inhibitors, such as saracatinib or imatinib. To
determine whether this observation could be extended to
other TGF-β-induced mesenchymal cell line models, we
performed a similar screen with the A549 NSCLC cell
line, which also undergoes TGF-β-induced EMT [19].

Upon TGF-β-induced EMT (Figure S2), the A549 cell
line becomes resistant to GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor,
and exhibits resistance to a variety of other anti-cancer
agents (Table S2). Consistent with our observation in the
mesenchymal HCC827 cell line, the mesenchymal A549
cells demonstrate increased sensitivity to dasatinib (Table
S2 and Figure S2). We extended this observation to two
additional TGF-β-induced EMT models, the pancreatic
cancer cell line, PANC-1 and the NSCLC cell line, H358,
as well to an acquired erlotinib resistance model (derived
from HCC4006 NSCLC cells) that had undergone EMT
independent of TGF-β [20]. In all of these models,
dasatinib was more effective at reducing viability in
the derived mesenchymal cells relative to their parental
counterparts (Figure 3A&B). In addition, a FACS-sorted
E-Cadherin-low population of the HCC827 mesenchymal
cells demonstrated greater sensitivity to dasatinib than the
E-Cadherin-positive population (Figure S3).
Since we had detected a low-percentage
mesenchymal sub-population that pre-exists within the
parental HCC827 cell line (Figure 1G), we next sought to
determine whether co-treatment of these cells with a low,

ineffective concentration of dasatinib (30nM) and erlotinib
could prevent the development of drug-resistance. In
HCC827 and HCC4006 cells, co-treatment with dasatinib
and erlotinib, prevented the development of resistance
to erlotinib (Figure 3C&D), whereas in the A549 cells
(EGFR wild-type), which are erlotinib-insensitive, cotreatment with dasatinib and erlotinib did not alter drug
sensitivity (Figure 3E). We next sought to determine
whether longer-term exposure to other anti-cancer drugs
would result in drug resistance, and whether the resistance
could be blocked by co-treatment with dasatinib. We
selected anti-cancer agents that showed activity selectively
in the parental cell line but were ineffective on the
mesenchymal cells, based on the cell line screening data
(Table 1, S1&S2). In the parental HCC827 cells, drugresistant cells were generated following exposure to the
chemotherapeutic agents docetaxel and doxorubicin or
the kinase inhibitors PD325901 (MEK) or BEZ235 (PI3 kinase) at a relatively high concentration of drug over
a period of several weeks (Figure 3C). Co-treatment
with dasatinib significantly reduced the number of
resistant cells to several tested anti-cancer agents. Similar

observations were made in the A549 parental cells,
where dasatinib co-treatment decreased the emergence of
resistant cells (Figure 3E). In addition, the HCC827 cells
remaining following dasatinib treatment alone (Figure 3C)
are sensitive to erlotinib, suggesting that the dasatinibresistant sub-population of cells were epithelial cells (data
not shown). These findings suggest that dasatinib cotreatment can prevent the emergence of drug resistance in
epithelial cancer cell populations by targeting the innately
more drug-resistant mesenchymal cell subpopulation.

the mesenchymal cells, implicating “amplified” FAK
signaling in those cells (Figure 4D). Consistent with the
mass spectrometry analysis, differential phosphorylation
of FAK was observed following erlotinib treatment in
both the parental and mesenchymal cells (Figure 4E).
In parental cells, but not in the mesenchymal cells,
erlotinib suppressed phospho-FAK at the Y397 and
Y925 sites (Figure 4E) and not at the Y570/Y576/
Y577 sites (Figure 4D). Whereas, dasatinib suppressed
phospho-FAK in the mesenchymal cells at each of the
phosphotyrosine sites (Figure 4D&E). The mesenchymal
cells did not demonstrate sensitivity to FAK inhibitors,
PF-562271 or PF-573228, and only demonstrated
modest sensitivity to PF-03814735 (Table 1, S1&S2);
however, dasatinib treatment caused a more pronounced
and prolonged decrease in pFAK than the tested FAKselective inhibitors (Figure S6). Other kinases identified
from the proteomic analysis that are associated with Src/
FAK signaling, EPHB1 and ACK-1, were only detected
in the mesenchymal cells, and were dephosphorylated by
dasatinib and not by erlotinib. Notably, Src kinase itself
was not differentially phosphorylated following drug
treatment (Figure 4E). Signaling pathways downstream
of EGFR, such as PI(3)K and MAPK were comparably
suppressed by erlotinib in the parental and mesenchymal
cells, which remained unperturbed by dasatinib (Figure
4E). However, downstream Src/FAK survival signals
including phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) and phospho-p38
(Thr180/Tyr182) were decreased by dasatinib but not by
erlotinib in the mesenchymal cells. Phosphorylated p38
was elevated in the mesenchymal cells compared to the
parental cells; however, the mesenchymal cells were
resistant to two p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB202190 and
SB220025 (Table S1), suggesting that suppression of
the entire Src/FAK pathway is required to decrease cell
viability in the drug-resistant mesenchymal cells (Figure
4E).

Src/focal adhesion kinase signaling is required for
EMT-associated drug resistance
To establish the mechanistic basis for dasatinib
sensitivity in the mesenchymal cell population, we
used KinomeView™ western blot analysis to profile
the phosphorylation differences between parental and
mesenchymal HCC827 cells in the presence and absence of
erlotinib to identify the kinase(s) responsible for resistance
in the mesenchymal cells. KinomeView™ blots to detect
tyrosine phosphorylation revealed major differences
following drug exposure in the derived mesechnymal cells
compared to the parental cells (Figure 4A). Specifically,
we observed a prominent phospho-tyrosine band at
approximately 140kDa that was effectively suppressed by
erlotinib in the parental cells but not in the mesenchymal
cells. Significantly, phosphorylation of a protein at this
same molecular weight is suppressed by dasatinib in the
mesenchymal cells.
Mass spectrometry analysis, was performed
following immunoaffinity enrichment of pTyr-containing
peptides and several unique phosphopeptides were
differentially observed upon EMT or following drug
exposure (Figure 4B and S4). Among these, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase FAK (focal adhesion kinase)
was one of the most prominent differentially detected
phosphoproteins, with a total of 47 unique pTyr peptides
represented in the analysis (Figure S5). In addition,
several proteins associated with Src/FAK signaling were
also identified, such as EPHB1 (RTK that can activate
FAK, Src and CASL) [21], ACK-1 (a non-receptor
kinase activated by Src and EGFR) [22], CASL (integrin
signaling adaptor) [23], BCAR3 (CAS and Src binding
protein) [24], VCL (cytoskeletal protein that regulates
focal adhesion) [25] and ABL1 (involved in cell adhesion
via phosphorylation of CASL, CRK, CRKL and BCAR1)
[26] (Figure 4B and S4).
The differential FAK phosphorylation was
prominently at the Y576/Y577 and Y925 sites (Src/FAK
recruitment activation) [27] and to a lesser extent at the
Y397 autophosphorylation site (Figure 4C). Doubly
phosphorylated kinase peptides were generally much less
abundant than their singly phosphorylated counterparts
in the parental cells; however, they were elevated in

EMT-associated drug resistance is dependent on
EPHB1/FAK/ACK-1 proteins
To directly examine a functional requirement
for Src/FAK pathway components in mediating drug
resistance associated with EMT, we used RNAi to deplete
several of the pathway components that were observed
to be differentially phosphorylated by mass spectrometry
analysis (Figure 4B and S7). Single gene knockdown
of FAK, ABL, CASL, BCAR3, Vinculin (VCL) and
EPHB1, had little effect on cell viability in either the
parental (Figure 5A) or mesenchymal cells (Figure 5B).
Similarly, Src depletion did not affect cell viability in
either the parental or mesenchymal cells (Figure 5A&B).
However, knockdown of ACK-1 decreased cell viability
by approximately 50% in the mesenchymal cells (Figure
5B and S7B) with 3 out of the 4 tested siRNAs, with no

Since knockdown of the various individual proteins
identified by mass spectrometry analysis did not affect cell
viability of the mesenchymal cells, and ACK-1 knockdown
was not sufficient to completely kill the mesenchymal

cells, we next sought to determine whether simultaneous
knockdown of the key kinases that were observed to be
differentially phosphorylated in these cell populations
could specifically kill the drug-resistant mesenchymal
cells. For this analysis, we included FAK, since it was

Dasatinib suppresses mesenchymal cell line tumor
growth in vivo

the most abundantly differentially phosphorylated kinase,
as well as EPHB1 and ACK-1, since they were only
expressed in the mesenchymal cells. In parental cells
(PAR), either single or combination knockdown of FAK,
ACK-1 or EPHB1 (Figure S8A), failed to induce apoptosis
as indicated by PARP cleavage (Figure 5C) or altered cell
viability (Figure 5E&F). Conversely, in the mesenchymal
drug-resistant cells, simultaneous knockdown of EPHB1,
ACK-1 and FAK (EAF) (Figure S8B), resulted cleaved
PARP (Figure 5D) and substantial loss of cell viability
(Figure 5E&F). These findings suggest that multiple Src/
FAK pathway kinases are required to maintain the viability
of the mesenchymal state, consistent with the ability of
the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor dasatinib to selectively
impact viability of these largely drug-resistant cells.

To extend the cell line findings to an in vivo tumor
context, we performed tumor xenograft studies in mice
using the parental A549 and derived TGF-β-treated
mesenchymal cell lines. The HCC827 mesenchymal cell
line failed to grow as a xenograft and therefore could not
be used for in vivo analysis (data not shown). We first
determined whether the TGF-β-induced mesenchymal
A549 cells retained their mesenchymal phenotype in vivo.
Parental A549 and TGF-β-induced mesenchymal cells
were each implanted subcutaneously in the flanks of nu/
nu mice. Tumors were harvested once they reached 150200mm3, and were found to express significantly lower
levels of E-Cadherin and elevated expression of SNAIL
compared to the parental xenografts (Figure 6A). We were
unable to detect vimentin in these cells (data not shown).

Next, to confirm that dasatinib could suppress downstream
Src/FAK signaling in vivo, we determined that dasatinib
treatment effectively suppressed phospho-p38 activity in
these tumors (Figure 6B). We then assessed the ability
of dasatinib to retard tumor growth in both the parental
and mesenchymal cell lines. Tumors were allowed to
grow until they reached 150-200mm3, after which the
mice received dasatinib treatment. Mice bearing A549
parental xenografts grew at a significantly reduced rate
relative to the A549 mesenchymal xenografts (Figure
6C,D). Upon dasatinib treatment, A549 mesenchymal
xenografts showed significant tumor growth suppression
(Figure 6D; p<0.0001). This effect was not observed in
the A549 parental xenografts, as tumors in dasatinibtreated animals grew at a similar rate to those in vehicletreated animals. Notably, the parental xenografts grew
at a modestly slower rate compared to the mesenchymal
xenografts, potentially contributing to the observed
effects of drug treatment on tumor growth inhibition. We
observed only a slight decrease in body weight, suggesting
that the observed tumor regression is not due to dasatinib
toxicity (Figure 6E,F). These observations support the
potential in vivo utility of dasatinib for a subset of human
tumors demonstrating drug resistance associated with a
mesenchymal phenotype.

[31]. However, selection of patients for this co-treatment
regimen based on EGFR mutation status and expression of
mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, may yield greater
benefit for this specific patient population.
Targeting Src/FAK pathway kinases in solid tumors
has been considered an attractive therapeutic approach by
virtue of potential effects on the tumor microenvironment
via inhibition of Src family kinase [32]. The Src/FAK
pathway kinases are core components of signaling initiated
by growth factors, integrins and cytokine receptors to
activate downstream signaling cascades such as Ras/Raf/
MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STATs [27, 33-35] that control
tumor growth [36] and other cellular process such as cell
motility, adhesion [27] and EMT [37]. Src/FAK and EGFR
converge on common downstream pathways [38], which
may account for the observed antitumor activity in patients
with advanced NSCLC co-treated with inhibitors of both
signaling pathways [31].
Dasatinib is an oral multi- BCR/ABL and Src
family tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the use in
patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
after imatinib treatment [39, 40] and in patients with
Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (Ph+ALL) [41]. More recently it has been
shown to be a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting c-Kit,
EPH, PDGFR and FAK [42, 43]. Src/FAK signaling has
been shown to induce E-Cadherin internalization during
cancer progression, in turn promoting EMT and tumor cell
motility [44], and EPH’s have been shown to be elevated
in mesenchymal cells [45]. Therefore targeting Src/FAK
and associated kinases with dasatinib in mesenchymal
cells may define a useful therapeutic approach.
We observed differential FAK signaling in response
to erlotinib in mesenchymal cells compared to epithelial
cells. FAK inhibitors themselves did not demonstrate
sensitivity in the mesenchymal cells, which may in part
be due to their lack of sustained inhibition as compared
to dasatinib. In addition, FAK knockdown did not result
in cell death of the mesenchymal cells, indicating that
FAK alone is not sufficient to perturb the viability of
mesenchymal cells. Targeting pathway components
downstream of Src/FAK signaling, such as p38, also
failed to impact cell viability of the mesenchymal cells.
These findings suggest that targeting the key upstream
components that are differentially activated upon EMT
may be required. We observed that EPHB1 and ACK1 expression is induced upon EMT, and combination
knockdown of EPHB1, ACK-1 and FAK specifically
promoted cell death in the mesenchymal cells, to a similar
degree as observed following dasatinib treatment. These
observations suggest that combined target inhibition of
each of the three kinases identified here is required to
significantly decrease the viability of mesenchymal cells.
In summary, our findings highlight the utility of
TGF-β-induced EMT models of TKI-addicted cancer
cells to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities

DISCUSSION
During the genesis of epithelial cancers, relatively
rare populations of cells with mesenchymal traits are
believed to contribute to tumor initiation, recurrence,
metastasis and drug resistance [1, 28-30]. These
mesenchymal cells tend to be more resistant to a variety
of anti-cancer agents when compared to the bulk tumor
compartment of epithelial cells, and therefore present
a major challenge to the successful outcome of clinical
treatment. Consequently, combination drug treatments that
include agents that target the mesenchymal subpopulation
of cells may provide a strategy to overcome some types of
drug resistance.
Our previous findings revealed a subpopulation of
cancer cells that displayed a distinct “cancer stem-like”
phenotype with an altered chromatin state, and increased
sensitivity to an IGF-1R TKI and HDAC inhibitors
[2]. However, the TGF-β-induced mesenchymal cells
described here were found to be resistant to IGF-1R TKI
and HDAC inhibitors, indicating a distinct mechanism of
drug resistance from that seen upon EMT. Our findings
demonstrate that the mesenchymal tumor cells are
sensitive to dasatinib treatment and that co-treatment of
EGFR mutant epithelial lung cancer cells with dasatinib
and erlotinib could prevent the emergence of erlotinib
resistance. Notably, the combination of erlotinib with
dasatinib in advanced lung cancer patients is well tolerated,
with some evidence of anti-tumor activity in previously
chemotherapy treated patients with advanced NCSLC

associated with this otherwise largely treatment-refractory
subpopulation of tumor cells. Such pre-clinical approaches
may prove valuable in establishing combination treatment
paradigms for tumors that intrinsically display a mixed
epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype, or have become more
mesenchymal in character during the acquisition of drug
resistance.

Pre-labeled DiIC12(3) BD Bioscience cell
suspensions in serum-free RPMI media were added to
the apical chamber of the BD BioCoat™ Tumor Invasion
System, 8µm, from BD Biosciences at 3 x 105 cells
per chamber. RPMI containing 10% FBS was added as
a chemoattractant to the bottom chamber. Chambers
were incubated for 20h at 37oC, 5% CO2, and invasion
of fluorescent cells was determined at a wavelength
of 549/565 nm (Ex/Em) using the Molecular Devices
SpectraMax® M5.

METHODS
Human cancer cell lines

Cell Viability

Human cancer cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection or Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismenund Zelkulturen, expanded, and
stored at early passage in a central bank. Cells were tested
and authenticated by SNP genotyping (see Supplementary
Procedures for details). Cell lines were maintained at 37oC
in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2 and grown either
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco), 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin.
To induce EMT, cells were treated with 2ng/ml of rhTGF-β1 every three days over a two to three week period.

Cell viability was assessed using the CyQUANT®
Direct Cell Proliferation Assay purchased from Life
Technologies. Cells (3000 or 750 per well) were seeded
into 96 or 384-well plates, respectively, and allowed to
adhere overnight in the absence of TGF-β. They were
then exposed to a range of drug concentrations for a
96-well plate. After 72h, CyQUANT® was added per
manufacturer’s instructions. Cell viability was determined
by fluorescence measurement using a 2104 EnVision
reader (PerkinElmer). For 6 cm dishes, cells were fixed
in 4% formaldehyde, stained with the nuclear fluorescent
dye SYTO 60 from Life Technologies, and images
were collected by fluorescence measurement using a
SpectraMax M5 microplate reader.

Inhibitors
Erlotinib and dasatinib were from LC laboratories.
Docetaxel and doxorubicin were from Sigma. PD325901
and BEZ235, were from Selleck Chemicals. GDC-0941
was synthesized at Genentech. Gemcitabine was from
Toronto Research. TGF-β1 was from R&D Systems Inc.
Additional drugs used in the screen are described in Table
S3.

Caspase-3/7 assay
Caspase-3/7 activity was assessed by the CaspaseGlo® 3/7 Assay (Promega). Cells (3000 per well) were
seeded, allowed to adhere overnight and exposed to
erlotinib (50nM) for 24h in the absence of TGF-β.
Caspase-Glo® 3/7 was added to the cells and incubated
for 30 minutes at room temperature per manufacturer’s
instructions. Caspase activity was measured by
luminescence measurement using a 2104 EnVision reader
(PerkinElmer).

Immunoblotting
Cell lysates were collected using Nonidet-P40
or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer,
supplemented with HALT protease and phosphatase
inhibitor
cocktail
(Thermo
Scientific),
and
immunodetection of electrophoresis-resolved proteins
was performed using standard protocols. The E-Cadherin,
vimentin, Snail, phospho-AKT, total AKT, phospho-p38,
total p38, phospho-pERK, total ERK, phospho-STAT3,
total STAT3, phospho-Src, total Src, phospho-pFAK,
total pFAK, phospho-ACK-1, total pEPHB1, cleaved
PARP, pTyr-1000, and GAPDH antibodies were from Cell
Signaling Technology. Total ACK-1, phospho-EPHB1
antibodies were from Abcam, and the PARP antibody
was from eBioscience. Kinomeview immunoblotting
was performed using the pTyr-1000 antibody from Cell
Signaling Technology.

FACS analysis/sorting
Cells were collected and washed twice in PBS/0.2%
serum, and incubated with E-Cadherin from cell signaling,
at 1:50, 4oC for 1 h. The cells were washed twice in
PBS/0.2% serum, resuspended in PBS and sorted on a
FACSAria from BD Biosciences.

Immunoaffinity enrichment and MS analysis

Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC)accredited facility. Five million A549 parental or
mesenchymal cells (suspended in a 1:1 mixture of HBSS/
Matrigel) were inoculated in the right flank of Nu/Nu
nude mice (Charles River Laboratories). When tumors
reached a volume between 150-200 mm3, mice were
treated with either vehicle control, or dasatinib (10 mg/
kg, 5 days/week, via IP injection). Tumors were measured
three times weekly using digital calipers (Fred V. Fowler
Company) and tumor volumes were calculated using the
formula (L × (W × W))/2. Differences between the vehicle
and dasatinib groups were determined using two-way
ANOVA.

Lysates were collected in buffer containing
20mM HEPES pH 8.0, 9M urea, 1mM sodium
orthovanadate, 2.5mM sodium pyrophosphate and
1mM β-glycerophosphate. Immunoaffinity enrichment
of pTry phosphopeptides and MS analysis was carried
out using PTMscan reagents and protocols (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) [46, 47]. Enriched
phosphopeptide samples were analyzed on an LTQOrbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific, San Jose, CA). Samples were injected onto a
0.1 x 100 mm C18 column packed with 1.7 µm BEH-130
material and separated by NanoAcquity UPLC (Waters,
Milford, MA) using a standard water/acetonitrile/formic
acid gradient. High resolution Orbitrap full MS scans
(MS1) were acquired on monoisotopic, charge state
defined precursors (z > 1) at 60K resolution and data
dependent MS/MS spectra acquired in the dual-linear ion
trap on the top15 most abundant ions in a data dependent
manner. Spectral data were searched using Mascot against
a concatenated target-decoy protein sequence database
(Uniprot v2011_12) considering oxidized methionine
(+15.9949) and phosphorylated serine, threonine or
tyrosine (+79.9663) as variable modifications and
carbamidomethylated cysteine (+57.0214) as a fixed
modification. Peptide spectral matches were serially
filtered to a 5% and 2% false discovery rates at the peptide
and protein levels, respectively and site localization
assessed using AScore [46].
