ABSTRACT
The development of multidrug-resistance (MDR) is a major contributor to death
in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Here, we investigated the possible role of microRNA
(miR)-503-5p in drug resistant CRC cells. Unbiased microRNA array screening revealed
that miR-503-5p is up-regulated in two oxaliplatin (OXA)-resistant CRC cell lines.
Overexpression of miR-503-5p conferred resistance to OXA-induced apoptosis and
inhibition of tumor growth in vitro and in vivo through down-regulation of PUMA
expression. miR-503-5p knockdown sensitized chemoresistant CRC cells to OXA.
Our studies indicated that p53 suppresses miR-503-5p expression and that deletion
of p53 upregulates miR-503-5p expression. Inhibition of miR-503-5p in p53 null
cells increased their sensitivity to OXA treatment. Importantly, analysis of patient
samples showed that expression of miR-503-5p negatively correlates with PUMA in
CRC. These results indicate that a p53/miR-503-5p/PUMA signaling axis regulates
the CRC response to chemotherapy, and suggest that miR-503-5p plays an important
role in the development of MDR in CRC by modulating PUMA expression.

oxaliplatin is multifactorial, and includes low-efficient
cellular drug uptake and accumulation [4], activation of
the antioxidant glutathione system for detoxification [5,
6], enhancement of DNA repair [7], and up-regulation of
anti-apoptosis pathways [8–11]. In order to comprehend
the molecular mechanisms of CRC oxaliplatin resistance,
our laboratory has established an in vitro chemoresistant
CRC cell line model by chronic exposure of human CRC
cells (HT29 & HCT116) to increasing doses of oxaliplatin.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are single-stranded noncoding RNAs, which could silent gene by binding to the

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third leading
cause of tumor-related death in the world [1], and it is
also one of the most shared malignant tumors in China.
Oxaliplatin is the third-generation platinum compound,
which is the first one to show efficacy in the colorectal
carcinoma treatment of platinum-based compounds [2].
Oxaliplatin induces formation of intra-strand guanineguanine and guanine-adenine DNA links, cell cycle
arrest, and death of proliferating cells [3]. Resistance to

three prime untranslated regions (3' UTRs) complementary
sequences of the target messenger RNA transcripts
(mRNAs)[12, 13]. MiRNAs only account about 1% of all
human genes, but they are predicted to adjust up to 30% of
human protein-coding genes expression [14–18]. Aberrant
miRNA expression has been reported in several types of
malignancies, including CRC [19–21]. However, the
mechanisms of miRNA involvement in the acquired drug
resistance of CRC cells are largely unknown. Our previous
studies have suggested that downregulation of miRNAs
may modulate drug resistance in colorectal carcinoma by
targeting multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins [22–25].
The p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis
(PUMA) is a BH3 domain only pro-apoptotic protein
belonging to the Bcl-2 family, also known as BBC3 (Bcl2
binding component 3). PUMA is an direct downstream
target of p53, but it still could induce p53-independent
apoptosis to a variety of stimulus [26–29]. p53 could be
altered in more than 50% of human cancers as a tumor
suppressor gene, which plays crucial roles in apoptosis,
DNA repair or cell cycle arrest [30–32]. And miRNA
expression could also be regulated by p53 in both
transcription-dependent (e.g. miR-34) and transcriptionindependent way (e.g. miR-15, miR-143, and miR-1915)
[33, 34].
In this examine, we have found a novel p53/miR503-5p/PUMA signaling way that regulates the response of
colorectal carcinoma cells to oxaliplatin. We demonstrate
that p53 suppresses expression of miR-503-5p and miR503-5p could increase after p53 deletion. Inhibiting miR503-5p expression in p53 Knock-out cells up-regulate
the their sensitivity to oxaliplatin. miR-503-5p induces
oxaliplatin resistance through the inhibition of apoptosis
by reducing PUMA expression, which could direct target
by miR-503-5p. In addition, a CRC xenograft mouse
model be using manifest that miR-503-5p reduce the effect
of oxaliplatin to CRC in vivo and inhibition of miR-5035p increase oxaliplatin sensitive to CRC drug resistance
cells in vivo. Importantly, examine of colorectal carcinoma
tissues evidence a negative correlation between miR530-5p and PUMA expression. Together, this study has
identified that miR-503-5p could play a crucial role in the
drug resistance of CRC by modulating PUMA expression,
and it will be a potential MDR treatment target in CRC.

cells. Since miR-503-5p expression was increased in both
oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines, we hypothesized that miR503-5p plays a paramount role in acquired oxaliplatinresistant CRC cells. Furthermore, to confirm the results
obtained by microarray profiling, we used RealtimePCR to
analysis miR-503-5p expression in the above 4 cell lines.
And the results manifested miR-503-5p up-regulated in
the HCT116-OxR and HT29-OxR cells as same as the
microarray data (Figure 1A).
To determine miR-503-5p target genes, three
algorithms be used to predict the target gene of miRNAs –
miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org), PicTar (http://
pictar.mdc-berlin.de/), and TargetScan (http://www.
targetscan.org). Based on the representation of miR-5035p recognition sites in their 3’ UTRs, we found that one
of the candidate target genes, PUMA, showed reduced
expression of mRNA and protein levels in HCT116-OxR
and HT29-OxR cells compared to their parental cells
(Figure 1B & 1C), suggesting that miR-503-5p might
induce oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells by targeting
PUMA.

PUMA is a posttranscriptional repression target
of miR-503-5p
The increased expression of miR-503-5p in CRCOxR cells was associated with the decreased protein
expression of PUMA. To determine the influence of
miR-503-5p on the PUMA expression, we transfected
HCT116 and HCT29 cells with miR-503-5p mimics or
control mimics, and transfected HCT116-OxR cells and
HCT29-OxR cells with miR-503-5p inhibitors or control
inhibitors. The qPCR results showed that the miR-5035p mimics increased miR-503-5p expression levels in
HCT116 and HT29 cells (Figure 2A), while miR-5035p inhibitors decreased the expression (Figure 2B). The
PUMA protein levels were inhibited in HCT116 and
HCT29 cells after miR-503-5p mimic-transfected (Figure
2C), and increased in HCT116-OxR and HCT29-OxR
cells after miR-503-5p inhibitor-transfected (Figure 2D).
To determine whether miR-503-5p directly targets
PUMA, a section of PUMA 3’ UTR including the miR503-5p binding site was cloned into a luciferase reporter
system, and a miR-503-5p binding site lacking plasmid
was used as a negative control for the system(Figure
2E). Both the reporter plasmid and miR-503-5p mimics
were transfected into the HCT116-OxR cells. The results
demonstrated that luciferase activity of PUMA 3’ UTR
fragment containing the miR-503-5p binding site is
inhibited by miR-503-5p. And no effect was observed
when the plasmid without the miR-503-5p binding sites
(Figure 2F).
To examine whether miR-503-5p also regulates
other apoptotic proteins, expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and
Mcl-1 was analyzed by western blotting in miR-5035p inhibitors transfected HCT116-OxR cells. Figure
2G shows that miR-503-5p inhibitors also modulate

RESULTS
miR-503-5p is overexpressed in oxaliplatinresistant CRC cells
In order to define whether microRNAs could be
involved in the development of drug-resistance in CRC,
we compared the miRNA expression profiles of CRC cell
and their oxaliplatin-resistant cell (HCT116 and HT29) by
using miRNA microarray (including 2578 human mature
miRNA). Table 1 lists 10 miRNAs that were differentially
expressed between the parental cells and the drug-resistant

those above proteins. As PUMA is a post-transcriptional
repression target of miR-503-5p, we also tested whether
miR-503-5p inhibitors could regulate caspase activity.
Figure 2H shows that miR-503-5p inhibitors activate
caspase-3 in the drug resistant cells. Taken together, these
data indicate that miR-503-5p decreases expression of
PUMA by targeting its 3' UTR directly, and miR-503-5p
could also modulates apoptosis level by PUMA.

To confirm the functional role of miR-503-5p in
inducing chemo-resistance by PUMA, we used PUMA
overexpression (PUMA OE) plasmid and PUMA knock
down (PUMA KD) shRNA plasmid (Figure 3A). The
results showed that increased level of miR-503-5p and

resistance of CRC cells.

apoptosis in HCT116 and HT29 cells, as evidenced by
a right shift of the growth inhibition curve (Figure 3C),
significantly reduced apoptosis (Figure 3E) and decreased
levels of cleaved PARP (Figure 3G). Conversely, inhibition
of miR-503-5p and overexpression of PUMA re-sensitized
HCT116-OxR and HT29-OxR cells to oxaliplatin
treatment, as evidenced by a left shift of the growth
inhibition curve (Figure 3D), increased apoptosis (Figure
3F), and increased cleavage of PARP (Figure 3H). The
above data demonstrate that miR-503-5p could modulate
the oxaliplatin-resistance phenotype of CRC cells.

p53 suppresses miR-503-5p expression in
CRC cells
Our above data suggested that miR-503-5p
promotes drug resistance CRC cells. Thus, we wanted
to determine the mechanisms regulating miR-503-5p
expression. Previous studies have indicated that p53
contributes to oxaliplatin and other chemotherapeutic
drug-induced apoptosis, thus playing a central role in
oxaliplatin resistance [35, 36]. Since our results have
shown that the PUMA expression, which is up-regulated
by p53, is decreased in oxaliplatin resistant CRC cells, and
the miR-503-5p expression is increased, we hypothesized
that the expression of miR-503-5p be suppressed by p53
in CRC cells. To confirm this hypothesis, we compared
the expression of miR-503-5p between HCT116 wild type
(WT) and p53 knock out (p53 KO) cells, and in HCT116OxR control (Ctrl) and p53 overexpressing (p53 OE) cells.
miR-503-5p expression was decreased in p53 KO cells
compared to WT cells, and decreased in p53 OE compared
to Ctrl cells (Figure 5A). And, p53 KO cells showed more
resistance to oxaliplatin than WT cells, and overexpression
of p53 could re-sensitize HCT116-OxR cells to oxaliplatin
(Figure 5B). The same results were obtained in apoptosis
assays (Figure 5C). Restored p53 expression in p53 KO
cells decreased miR-503-5p expression (Figure 5D,
right panel), showing that p53 inhibits the expression of
miR-503-5p. It is worth noting that, PUMA expression
was increased in p53 re-expressed cells (Figure 5D,
left panel). Therefore, p53 expression restoration of
HCT116 p53 KO cells sensitized the cells to Oxaliplatin
treatment (Figure 5F & 5G). To confirm whether miR503-5p is liable for the resistance of p53 KO cells to
oxaliplatin treatment, the miR-503-5p inhibitors were
transfected into p53 KO cells. The inhibitors decreased
miR-503-5p expression in p53 KO cells as documented
by RealtimePCR (Figure 5E, right panel), which led to
increasing expression of PUMA (Figure 5E, left panel).
Reduction of miR-503-5p effectively sensitized oxaliplatin
to p53 KO cells, as evidenced by a left shift of the growth
inhibition curve (Figure 5F), and increased apoptosis
(Figure 5G). These examines indicate that inhibition of
miR-503-5p expression is one of the mechanisms by p53
promotes oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis, furthermore the
raising miR-503-5p expression contributes to oxaliplatin
resistance in p53 KO cells.

miR-503-5p reduces effectiveness of oxaliplatin
in CRC in vivo
The above results showed that overexpression of
miR-503-5p induced oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells in
vitro. To verity this results in vivo, a CRC xenograft model
was established by subcutaneously inoculating nude mice,
injecting with HCT116 cells (2 × 106) expressing ctrl vector
or miR-503-5p, or HCT116-OxR cells (2 × 106) expressing
ctrl vector or miR-503-5p miArresst. After 2 weeks, we
divided those mice randomly into two groups. 10 mg/kg
oxaliplatin was injected administered by i.p. into one group,
and control solution was treated to the other group every
4 days. To determine the therapeutic sensitivity during the
treatment, we monitored the tumor volume of each group.
Xenograft tumor growth curves demonstrated that tumors
had a independent similar rate after miR-503-5p expressed.
Moreover, a big difference was showed in the response of
tumors under oxaliplatin treated. Tumors contained with
control vector (control tumors) growing was inhibited
during oxaliplatin treated, in addition tumors contained
with miR-503-5p (miR-503-5p tumors) kept on growing at
a stable rate (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the size (Figure 4C)
and weight (Figure 4D) of miR-503-5p tumors manifested
obviously smaller reduction of after oxaliplatin treatment
than control tumors. As a complementary approach in
the group of OxR-tumors, we observed that OxR-tumors
with miR-503-5p miArresst expressing cells (miR-5035pi OxR-tumor) exhibited increased effectiveness of
oxaliplatin in the inhibition of tumor growth compared
to the OxR-tumors with control vector-expressing cells
(control OxR-tumor) (Figure 4A), the same effect on
tumor size (Figure 4C), and tumor weight (Figure 4E).
Next, We used TUNEL assay to determine the tumors
apoptotic index, Ki67 staining was used to determine the
proliferative levels of tumors (Figure 4F & 4G). The results
showed that miR-503-5p overexpressed significantly
decreased the growth-inhibitory effect of oxaliplatin in
CRC-Par cells by Ki67 level, and decreased oxaliplatininduced apoptosis of CRC-Par cells. Down-regulation
of miR-503-5p suppressed CRC-OxR cell growth under
oxaliplatin treatment, and increased oxaliplatin-induced
apoptosis of CRC-OxR cells. The above data indicated that
miR-503-5p could modulate the oxaliplatin effectiveness to
CRC in vivo. Taken together, the results of in vitro and in

DISCUSSION

(Figure 6A). To investigate the association between miR503-5p and PUMA, we measured the PUMA expression
in tissues by qPCR and western blotting. However, we
did not find any significant differences in PUMA mRNA
levels (Figure 6B) or protein levels (Figure 6E & 6F)
between CRC and NC tissues. In Figure 6C and 6G,
each point in the scatter graph represents an individual
sample with the relative miR-503-5p level indicated on
the y-axis, and the PUMA expression indicated on the
x-axis. The correlation coefficient indicated that there is
a strong negative relationship between miR-503-5p and
PUMA mRNA expression (r = -0.58, p < 0.01) (Figure
6C), or PUMA protein expression (r = -0.81, p < 0.01)
(Figure 6G) in CRCs. The Spearman’s rank statistical test
was used for analysis. The expression of miR-503-5p and
PUMA mRNA were described by the formulas 2-ΔCt and
2-, and the levels of PUMA protein was described by the
detected bands’ intensity of PUMA protein/β-actin protein.
We found that high miR-503-5p expression was always
associated with low PUMA expression. Using the MannWhitney test, we have shown that miR-503-5p expression
inversely correlates with PUMA expression (P<0.01)
(Figure 6D & 6H).

Previous works have suggested that miRNAs play
an crucial role in cancer progression, and that miRNA
expression signatures may be used as potential diagnostic
and prognostic markers for cancer diagnosis and treatment
[18–25]. However, the specific role of miRNAs in
development of cancer MDR remains largely unexplored.
Our research demonstrates participation of miRNAs in the
development of MDR in CRC cells, indicating that miRNAs
may act as potential targets for chemo-sensitizing strategies.
We have found that ten microRNAs exhibit
differential expression between two parental CRC cell
lines HCT116 and HT29, and their oxaliplatin-resistant
derivative cells (Table 1), suggesting that them could
play paramount role in the oxaliplatin resistance in
CRC. Nowadays, the major clinical treatment strategy
of colorectal carcinomas is platinum drugs. Thence the
platinum-drug resistance turns into a urgent clinical
problem that needs to be resolved. It is critical to
delineate the drug resistance mechanisms to commonly
used therapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin. Importantly,
the mechanisms underlying the resistance to oxaliplatin

link between miR-503-5p and oxaliplatin resistance. This
link likely relates a PUMA-mediated mechanism. In the
first place, by miRNA microarray profiling, we showed
that miR-503-5p is expressed at elevated levels in two
oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines. And then, we demonstrated
that miR-503-5p regulates PUMA expression by directly
binding to the PUMA 3’UTR site. Third, we demonstrated

that overexpression of miR-503-5p protects parental
CRC cells from oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis, and that
suppression of miR-503-5p sensitizes resistant CRC cells
to oxaliplatin in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we have defined
a novel p53/miR-503-5p/PUMA signaling axis that
mediates the response of CRC cells to oxaliplatin. In wild
type p53 cells, miR-503-5p expression was suppressed and
oxaliplatin treatment induced apoptosis, while in p53 KO

cells, miR-503-5p expression was up-regulated and cells
became resistant to oxaliplatin. The miR-503-5p inhibitors
could re-sensitize p53 KO cells to oxaliplatin treatment.
Previous study determined that p53 regulate PUMA
in transcriptional level. Here in our results demonstrated
that PUMA is also a direct target of miR-503-5p in CRC
cells. Since p53 suppresses expression of miR-503-5p,
p53 could regulate PUMA expression in two different
mechanisms: regulating its promoter activity through
transcriptional factors and its 3’UTR through miR-5035p. Since resistance to oxaliplatin treatment is one of
the main reason for the failure of chemotherapy in CRC,
the findings of miR-503-5p as a contributing factor of
MDR and the certification of the p53/miR-503-5p/PUMA
signaling axis should help design strategies to increase
efficacy of oxaliplatin treatment of CRC.
Interestingly, we found that miR-503-5p was upregulated in CRC tissues compared to NC tissues, and a
strong negative relationship was observed between miR503-5p and PUMA gene and protein expression in CRC
tissues. Our results present the first evidence that miRNAs
may be involved in the development of MDR in colorectal
carcinoma cells by P53/PUMA pathway. In addition,
our results demonstrate that miR-503-5p may modulate
PUMA-mediated MDR of tumor cells to chemotherapy
drugs. Our data manifestedthat the overexpression of miR503-5p contributed to the loss of PUMA and oxaliplatin
resistance in CRC-OxR cells, suggesting that targeting
P53/miR-503-5p/PUMA might have significance for
prevention and reversion of MDR in CRC.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that miR-5035p expression negatively correlates with PUMA expression
in colorectal carcinoma cells. Moreover, our findings of
miR-503-5p as a regulatory of drug response in CRC offers
another potential therapeutic way. Reduction of miR-5035p expression may increase chemosensitivity in CRC
treatment. Our findings contribute to the understanding
of MDR regulation in cancer cells. Additionally, these
findings may be beneficial for future research of predicting
drug resistance in patients, and designing personalized
therapy for colorectal carcinoma patients.

MiR-503-5p mimics, negative control mimics,
miR-503-5p inhibitors, and negative control inhibitors
were purchased from Exiqon Inc. (Woburn, MA). cDNA
encoding miR-503-5p precursor and miArrest were
cloned into pMCS-CMV lentiviral vector purchased from
GeneChem, Shanghai, P.R. China. PUMA knock down
shRNA plasmid and p53 CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmid
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA). PUMA overexpression plasmid and p53
overexpression plasmid were purchased from Addgene
(Cambridge, MA). 293T packaging cells were cotransfected with pPackH1 packaging plasmid mix (SBI,
Mountain View, CA) and the lentiviral vectors using
Fugene HD (Promega, Madison, WI). Viruses were
harvested 48 hours later and used to infect target cells.

Tissue samples
Human CRC and their corresponding NC (nontumorous colon) samples were collected at the time of
surgical resection at Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University
of Traditional Chinese Medicine, P.R. China, from January
2010 to December 2011. Written informed consent was
obtained from the patients, in accordance with the
institutional guidelines, before sample collection, and the
study was approved by the Committees for the Ethical
Review of Research at the Putuo Hospital, Shanghai
University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, P.R. China.
The methods were performed in accordance with the
approved guidelines. All patients had a histological
diagnosis of colorectal cancer and received radical
resection. None of the patients included in the study had
received neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. Samples
were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80°C.

miRNA microarray analysis
Prior to experimentation, HCT116-OxR cells
and HT29-OxR cells were cultured 1 week without
oxaliplatin. Total RNA from HCT116, HCT116-OxR,
HT29 and HT29-OxR cell lines was isolated with Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and miRNA fraction
was further purified using a mirVanaTM miRNA isolation
kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The isolated miRNAs was
labeled with Hy3 using the miRCURYTM Array Labelling
kit (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) and hybridized on a
miRCURYTM LNA microRNA Array (v 8.0, Exiqon) as
described [37]. Microarray images were acquired using a
Genepix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City,
CA) and processed and analyzed with Genepix Pro 6.0
software (Axon Instruments) and Excel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Human colorectal carcinoma cell lines HCT116
and HT29 (obtained from the Cell Bank of Chinese
Academy of Science) and their oxaliplatin-resistant
variants HCT116-OxR and HT29-OxR (established
and maintained in our laboratory) were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco Industries, Inc.) with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gibco Industries, Inc.) at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. HCT116-OxR and
HT29-OxR cells were seeded in a medium containing
5 μg/ml of oxaliplatin (OXA) to maintain their drugresistance phenotype.

Quantitative RT-PCR
To prepare total RNA from tissues, the frozen
tissues were ground into finely ground particles after
21729

Oncotarget

5-mm3 sections of each sample were cut, and then the
tissue particles were subjected to extraction of RNA
with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from
cultured HCT116, HCT116-OxR, HT29 and HT29-OxR
cells with Trizol (Invitrogen). The concentration of total
RNA was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260
nm. Expression of mature miRNAs was assayed using
stem-loop RT followed by real-time PCR analysis as
previously described [38]. All reagents for stem-loop RT
were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).
The relative amount of each miRNA was normalized to U6
snRNA. The relative expression levels of each cell line of
each group were measured using the 2-ΔΔCt method [38].
Briefly, the average ΔCt of each group was calculated by
following formula: ΔCt = average miR-503-5p Ct - average
of HK (housekeeping) gene (U6 snRNA)' Ct. ΔΔCt was
calculated by ΔΔCt = ΔCt of control group- ΔCt of the
treated group. The fold change for miR-503-5p expression
level in cell lines was calculated using 2-ΔΔCt. The results
are presented as fold change for each miRNA from
HCT116-OxR or HT29-OxR cells relative to its control
(HCT116 or HT29 cells). And the miR-503-5p expression
level in tissues was calculated using 2-ΔCt. The primers of
miR-503-5p and U6 snRNA used for stem-loop RT-PCR
were purchased from QIAGEN Inc. (Valencia, CA). For
SYBR Green quantitative PCR amplifications, reaction
was performed in a 20 ml reaction volume contained
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
The relative expression levels of each cell line of each
group were measured using 2-ΔΔCt methods as before.
And the relative expression level of tissues was measured
using the 2-ΔCt. The primer sequences as followed:
PUMA,
5’GCGAGACTGTGGCCTTGTGT-3’,
5’-CGTTCCAGGGTCCACAAAGT-3’;
GAPDH,
5’-CTCCATCCTGGCCTCGCTGT-3’, 5’-GCTGTCAC
CTTCACCGTTCC-3’.

used at 1 μg/ml of working concentration in PBS with
5% dried-milk. The membrane was further probed with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit antimouse IgG (Santa Cruz, 1:2000) and the protein bands
were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Pharmacia Corp, Piscataway, NJ).
Quantification of protein bands was performed using the
ImageJ software.

Luciferase activity assay

In vivo xenograft model

The wild-type and mutated miR-503-5p putative
targets on PUMA 3’UTR were cloned into pGL3promoter vector. The cells (2 ×104) were cotransfected
with 500 ng of pGL3-PUMA-WT or pGL3-PUMA-Mut
constructs with miR-503-5p mimics. Each sample was
cotransfected with 50 ng of pRL-SV40 plasmid expressing
renilla luciferase to monitor the transfection efficiency.
A luciferase activity assay was performed 48 h after
transfection with the dual luciferase reporter assay system
(Promega, Wisconsin, USA). The relative luciferase
activity was normalized to the renilla luciferase activity.

Experiments involving animals were approved by
Institutional Review Board of the Putuo District Center
Hospital. HCT116 cells (2×106) expressing miR-503-5p
or an control vector were injected into the flank of male
athymic nude mice (4-5 weeks old); and HCT116-OxR
cells (2×106) expressing miR-503-5p miArresst (miR503-5pi) or an control vector were injected into the flank
of male athymic nude mice (4-5 weeks old). Two weeks
after injection, oxaliplatin (10 mg/kg) or carrier was
administered by i.p. injection every 4 days for 4 weeks
[23]. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated by the formula
V = W2 × L × 0.5, where W represents the largest tumor
diameter in centimeters and L represents the next largest
tumor diameter. The relative tumor volumes (RTV) were
calculated by RTV = Vx/V0 where Vx is the volume in
cubic millimeters at a given time and V0 is the volume at
the beginning of the treatment [39]. Tumors were dissected
out and weighted.

Cell viability and apoptosis assays
Colon cancer cells were plated in 96-well plates and
treated with oxaliplatin for indicated times. After 48 h, cell
viability was assessed using an MTT assay (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO). The absorbance at 490 nm of each well was
read on a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA.)
Cell viability was calculated as a ratio of OD values of
drug treated samples to those of controls. Apoptosis was
detected using a DNA fragmentation ELISA kit (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN).

Caspase-3 activity assay
HCT116-OxR cells (1 × 106/dish) were seeded in
10 cm dishes in antibiotic-free medium and transfected
with control oligonucleotide (40 nM) or inhibitors (40
nM) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48h,
cells were collected, washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA,
and 10 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Cell
lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000g for 3
min, and clear lysates containing 50 mg of protein were
incubated with 100 mM of enzyme-specific colorimetric
substrate at 37°C for 1h. The activity of caspase-3 was
expressed as the cleavage of colorimetric substrate by
measuring absorbance at 405 nm.

Western blot analysis
Proteins were resolved on SDS/PAGE gel and
subjected to immunoblot analysis using monoclonal
antibodies against PUMA, cleaved PARP, p53 or β-actin
(Cell Signaling Technology, US). All antibodies were
