Abstract
The clinical efﬁcacy of EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors geﬁtinib and erlotinib is limited by the development of drug resistance. The most common mechanism of drug resistance is the secondary EGFR T790M mutation. Strategies to overcome EGFR T790M-mediated drug resistance include the use of mutant selective EGFR
inhibitors, including WZ4002, or the use of high concentrations of irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors such
as PF299804. In the current study, we develop drug-resistant versions of the EGFR-mutant PC9 cell line, which
reproducibly develops EGFR T790M as a mechanism of drug resistance to geﬁtinib. Neither PF299804-resistant
nor WZ4002-resistant clones of PC9 harbor EGFR T790M. Instead, they have shown activated insulin-like growth
factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling as a result of loss of expression of IGFBP3 with the IGF1R inhibitor, BMS 536924,
restoring EGFR inhibitor sensitivity. Intriguingly, prolonged exposure to either PF299804 or WZ4002 results in the
emergence of a more drug-resistant subclone that exhibits ERK activation. A MEK inhibitor, CI-1040, partially restores
sensitivity to the EGFR/IGF1R inhibitor combination. Moreover, an IGF1R or MEK inhibitor used in combination with
either PF299804 or WZ4002 completely prevents the emergence of drug-resistant clones in this model system. Our
studies suggest that more effective means of inhibiting EGFR T790M will prevent the emergence of this common drug
resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutant non–small cell lung cancer. However, multiple drug resistance mechanisms
can still emerge. Preventing the emergence of drug resistance, by targeting pathways that become activated in
resistant cancers, may be a more effective clinical strategy. Cancer Res; 73(2); 834–43. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) geﬁtinib and erlotinib are clinically effective therapies for patients
with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-mutant
cancers (1–6). However, therapy is universally limited by the
development of acquired drug resistance (7). The most common mechanism of acquired drug resistance is the secondary
EGFR T790M mutation and is detected in up to 60% of patients
with EGFR-mutant NSCLC that develop acquired drug resistance to either geﬁtinib or erlotinib (8–10). The EGFR-mutant
PC9 cell line has been used as model of drug resistance and
reproducibly develops EGFR T790M following prolonged in

vitro exposure to geﬁtinib or other reversible EGFR kinase
inhibitors (11–13).
Irreversible second-generation EGFR TKIs are undergoing
clinical development to overcome EGFR T790M-mediated drug
resistance. The quinazoline-based irreversible TKIs, including
neratinib (HKI-272), afatinib (BIBW2992), and dacomitinib
(PF299804) have been shown to have potency against EGFR
T790M-bearing models at high concentrations in preclinical
models (14–16). However, when used at low concentrations,
those achievable in patients with NSCLC being clinically
treated with these agents, the resistance induced by these
drugs in EGFR-mutant models, including in the PC9 cells, also
occurs through the emergence of the T790M mutation (17, 18).
In accordance with these preclinical data, neratinib and afatinib has shown only modest efﬁcacy in patients with EGFRmutant NSCLC that had developed acquired resistance to
geﬁtinib or erlotinib (19, 20). One potential reason why neratinib or afatinib have not been effective clinically is due to the
inability to achieve sufﬁcient drug concentrations to inhibit
EGFR T790M in patients with NSCLC. Dose escalation of
irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors is limited by on target
inhibition of wild-type (WT) EGFR, which leads to dose-limiting skin rash (21, 22). These clinical observations have
prompted the development of alternative strategies to inhibit
EGFR T790M. One strategy is to develop mutant-selective
EGFR inhibitors. In prior studies, we identiﬁed a novel class
of irreversible pyrimidine inhibitors, including WZ4002, which

Resistance to Irreversible EGFR Inhibitors

are signiﬁcantly more potent against EGFR T790M compared
with irreversible quinazoline-based inhibitors (23). An alternative strategy is to use high, but intermittent, doses of current
clinical agents including dacomitinib that may lead to sufﬁcient drug concentrations to inhibit EGFR T790M as was
observed in prior studies (11).
While the use of more effective therapeutic approaches
against EGFR T790M may prevent the clinical emergence of
this mechanism of drug resistance, such therapies are unlikely
to cure advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Understanding these
resistance mechanism(s) will allow the identiﬁcation and
subsequent prioritization of rationale treatment strategies
and/or combination therapies. These combination strategies
may ultimately lead to a more effective therapeutic cocktail
against EGFR-mutant NSCLC translating to improved patient
outcome. To address and study mechanisms of resistance that
may emerge instead of EGFR T790M, we generated models of
drug resistance to the PC9 cells using 2 structurally different
EGFR TKIs, the quinazoline irreversible inhibitor PF00299804,
and the pyrimidine irreversible inhibitor WZ4002.

Materials and Methods
Generation of drug-resistant cell lines
PF299804-resistant (PFR) clones of PC9 cells were generated
by exposing cells to increasing concentrations (up to 1 mmol/L)
of PF299804 as previously described (11, 24). WZ4002-resistant
(WZR) PC9 cells were generated in a 96-well plate, 200 cells
per well, and exposed to 1 mmol/L of WZ (17).
Individual clones from PFR cells or WZR cells were selected.
Once cells had reached conﬂuence, they were passed 5 more
times in a medium with drug, then the drug was withdrawn and
cells were conﬁrmed to be drug-resistant using an MTS assay
(11, 24).
Cell culture and reagents
The EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell line PC9 has been previously
characterized (25). PC9, PFR, and WZR cells were cultured in
RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Drug-resistant cells were
cultured with 1 mmol/L of PF299804 or WZ4002. PF299804
was obtained from Pﬁzer. Trichostatine A and CI-1040 were
purchased from Calbiochem. BMS-536924 and OSI-906 were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Recombinant human
IGFBP3 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. WZ4002 was
synthesized as previously described (23). The PC9 cells were
obtained from Dr. Nishio (Kinki University, Osaka, Japan)
and conﬁrmed by ﬁngerprinting using the Power Plex 1.2
system (Promega) most recently in March 2012.
Cell proliferation and growth assays
Growth and inhibition of growth was assessed by MTS assay
according to previously established methods (11, 24, 26). All
experimental points were set up in 6 to 12 wells and all
experiments were repeated at least 3 times. These data were
graphically displayed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for
Windows (GraphPad Software Inc.).
For clonogenic assays, 2,000 cells were plated in a 6-well
plate, incubated overnight, then treated with indicated drug
concentrations. Eight to 10 days later, wells were ﬁxed with a

www.aacrjournals.org

0.5% crystal violet solution. Number of colonies formed was
estimated with the Image J software (NI H, Bethesda, MD).
All experimental points were set up in 3 wells and all
experiments were repeated at least twice. These data were
graphically displayed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for
Windows.
Prevention of emergence of resistance
PC9 cells were plated (200 cells/well in 96-well format) and
were either untreated or treated with one drug or combinations of drugs. The medium and drugs were regularly renewed
for up to 3 months. Each conﬂuent well was considered as one
resistant colony.
Antibodies and Western blot analysis
Cells grown under the previously speciﬁed conditions were
lysed in a Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). Western blot
analyses were conducted after separation by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was conducted according to the antibody manufacturer's recommendations. Antiphospho-Akt (Ser-473), antitotal-Akt, antiphospho-IGF1R (pY1135), antitotal-IGF1R, and
anti-EGFR antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The phospho-EGFR (pY1068), total-ERK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2 (pT185/pY187) antibodies were purchased from
Invitrogen. The anti-KDM5A and anti-DUSP6 antibodies were
purchased from Abcam.
EGFR and IGF1R mutational analysis
Total RNA was isolated from cell lines or tumors using Trizol
(Invitrogen) and puriﬁed using RNeasy minielute cleanup kit
(Qiagen). cDNA was transcribed with Superscript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and used as
template for subsequent PCR-based studies. The PCR primers
and conditions are available upon request.
IGFBP3 methylation studies
Promoter methylation of IGFBP3 was evaluated using previously published methods and primers (27).
Gene expression analysis
Methods for Gene Expression Analysis have been
described elsewhere (28). Synthesis of cRNA and hybridization to Human Expression Array U133 A2.0 chips were
conducted following Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix, Inc.).
Probe-level intensity data ﬁles in the CEL format were
preprocessed using Robust Multichip Average program
using the GenePattern software (Broad Institute). Probes
representing the same genes were collapsed into a single
value, and standardized by taking the median value for each
gene across sample set in the GenePattern software. The
normalized data were subject to comparative maker selection module in GenePattern, and genes differentially
expressed in the samples that meet deﬁned criteria [P <
0.01, fold change (FC) >4] were selected. The expression
values of the genes were log 2 converted and represented in a
heat map using GENE-E. The expression data have been
deposited to GEO (accession GSE38404).

Results
Establishment of PC9-derived clones resistant to the
irreversible EGFR inhibitors PF299804 and WZ4002
PF299804-resistant cells were obtained by chronic exposure
of PC9 cells to increasing doses of PF299804 up to 1 mmol/L
using previously established methods (11, 24). All PFR clones
had an IC50 for PF299804 more than 100-fold that of parental
PC9 cells (Fig. 1A). WZR cells were obtained by exposing PC9
cells to 1 mmol/L of WZ4002 (17). WZR cells had an IC50 about
10-fold that of parental PC9 cells (Fig. 1B). Within 4 to 6
months, more than 4 independent PFR clones and 4 WZR
clones were isolated. Resistance to PF299084 and WZ4002 was
maintained overtime for PFR and WZR cells, respectively, even
after 20 passages in a medium with no drug (data not shown).
The PFR and WZR cells were cross-resistant to WZ4002 and
PF299804, respectively, as well as geﬁtinib (data not shown).
PFR and WZR cells maintain AKT signaling in the
presence of PF299804 or WZ4002 treatment
We next evaluated the effects of PF299804 and WZ4002 on
phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK1/2 in the parental and
PFR or WZR clones. In both the parental and drug-resistant
clones, PF299804 and WZ4002 effectively inhibited EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 1C and D). Consistent with these observations,
no secondary mutations in EGFR were detected in any of the PFR

A

or WZR clones (data not shown). However, unlike in the parental
PC9 cells, in both PFR and WZR clones, AKT phosphorylation
was maintained following PF299804 and WZ4002 treatment,
respectively, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1C and D). As
PF299804 and WZ4002 still inhibited EGFR phosphorylation,
unlike in the PC9 cells, EGFR is unlikely to be responsible for
activation of AKT signaling in these drug-resistant cells (Fig. 1).
In contrast to AKT, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited in all
but one PFR clones (PFR 5) and in all of the WZR cells (Fig. 1C
and D) suggesting that EGFR still controls ERK1/2 signaling in
the majority of the drug-resistant cells.
PFR and WZR cells are sensitive to concurrent EGFR and
IGF1R inhibition
To identify how AKT was activated in the PFR and WZR
clones, we tested the sensitivity of these cells to drugs inhibiting PI3K/AKT (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) signaling
to determine if they would reverse drug resistance. The persistence of AKT phosphorylation, but not ERK1/2 phosphorylation following drug exposure and reversal of resistance by
the PI3K inhibitor PI-103 (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D) in
the drug-resistant cell lines, suggests that PI3K signaling may
be activated by the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R;
ref. 29). Furthermore, PI-103 and CI-1040 (MEK inhibitor)
combination phenocopied the effects of PI-103 and PF299804

assay (Fig. 2A and C). The IC50 of PFR3 cells for PF299804 was
more than 100-fold lower with the combination of BMS536924
and PF00299804 than with PF00299804 alone (Fig. 2A). Similar
results were observed with OSI-906, a dual IGF1R/insulin
receptor TKI, when combined with either PF299804 or WZ4002
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B; ref. 31).
The combined treatment with BMS536924 and PF299804
effectively inhibited AKT phosphorylation in the PFR3 but not
PFR5 cells (Fig. 2E). Similar ﬁndings were observed when
BMS536924 was combined with WZ4002 in the WZR cells (Fig.
2F). We noted that the levels of IGF1R phosphorylation were
higher in PFR clones compared with parental PC9 cells,
especially without serum in the culture medium (Fig. 2G). No
mutations in the tyrosine kinase of IGF1R were detected in
either the PFR or the WZR clones (data not shown). Prior

evaluate the role of IGF1R, we evaluated BMS536924, an IGF1R
inhibitor alone or in combination with PF299804 or WZ4002 in
the drug-resistant cell lines (30). Although not effective when
used as a single agent (Supplementary Fig. S2A), BMS536924,
restored drug sensitivity in both PFR and WZR cells when used
in combination with PF299804 or WZ4002, respectively (Figs.
2A and 2B). The effects were similar in both short-term [3 days
(Figs. 2A and B)] and long-term clonogenic [2 weeks (Figs. 2C
and D)] assays. The only clone in which BMS536924 did not
fully restore sensitivity to PF299804 was PFR5, which was also
the only drug-resistant clone to maintain ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figs. 1C and 2A). However, in the clonogenic assay,
there was some effect of BMS536924 and PF299804 in the PFR5
clone consistent with the modest effect observed in the MTS

expression analyses and compared the ﬁndings to the parental
PC9 cells. Interestingly, we found that IGFBP3 was downregulated in the PFR3 cells, compared with parental PC9 cells
(Fig. 3A). IGFBP3 is the main carrier protein for insulin-like
growth factors and its downregulation has already been implicated as a mechanism of acquired resistance in the EGFR wildtype A431 cell line to geﬁtinib (29). We further validated the
ﬁndings from the gene expression studies by Western blotting
(Fig. 3A). All of the resistant clones, including PFR5, showed
reduced levels of IGFBP3 compared with the parental PC9 cells.
The decreased expression of IGFBP3 is as a result of promoter
methylation as determined by methylation-speciﬁc PCR (Supplementary Fig. S5).
We next tested whether reexpression of IGFBP3 alone could
sensitize the PFR3 cells to PF299804. Treatment of PFR3 cells
with recombinant IGFBP3 restored sensitivity to PF299804 in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). There was no effect of IGFBP3

using a clonogenic assay (Fig. 3C). The addition of IGFBP3 also
restored the ability of PF299804 to downregulate Akt phosphorylation in the PFR3 cells in accordance with the observations in
the growth assays (Fig. 3D). Our studies suggest that in the drugresistant cell lines, downregulation of IGFBP3 leads to the
activation of IGF1R signaling, which activates PI3K/AKT signaling resulting in resistance to either PF299804 or WZ4002.

cells (Figs. 1C and 4C) thus allowing the latter cell population to
emerge even in the presence of drug.
To understand why the PFR3þ cells had a faster rate of
proliferation (Fig. 5A) and persistent ERK1/2 signaling in the
presence of PF299804 (Fig. 4C), we conducted gene expression
analyses comparing the PFR3 and PFR3þ cells. These studies
revealed that several phosphatases, including members of the
dual-speciﬁc phosphatase (DUSP) family, that normally inhibit
ERK1/2 signaling, were downregulated in the PFR3þ compared with the PFR3 cells. DUSP6 has shown the greatest
degree of downregulation (7-fold) between the PFR3þ and
PFR cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A). By Western blotting, we
observed decreased levels of DUSP6 in both in the PFR3þ and
PFR5 cells compared with PC9 and PFR3 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S8B). We further conﬁrmed that DUSP6 expression was
dependent on ERK1/2 signaling in various lung cancer cell
lines, including PC9 and PFR3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8B
and S8C). However, in PFRþ cells, levels of DUSP6 remained
low, despite high levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting
a disconnection in the negative feedback (Supplementary Fig.
S8B). We expressed DUSP6 in the PFR3þ cells to determine
whether reexpression could restore the sensitivity of the
PFR3þ cells to PF29904/BMS536924. However, despite adequate expression of DUSP6, the cells remained resistant to the
drug combination (data not shown).
Given the high levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and the
gene expression studies showing downregulation of multiple

phenotype from their PFR3 and WZR4 counterparts. Unlike
PFR3 and WZR4, the PFR3þ and WZR4þ cells were no longer
sensitive to the combination of BMS536924 and either
PF299804 or WZ4002 (Fig. 4B). There were no differences in
pIGF1R in PFR3þ and WZR4þ cells compared with their
parental counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S6). Furthermore,
in the PFR3þ and WZR4þ cells, neither PF299804 nor WZ4002
inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation unlike in the PFR3 or WZR4
cells (Fig. 4C). These observations are similar to those in the
PFR5 cells (Figs. 1C and 2A). No secondary mutations in NRAS,
KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MEK1, MEK2, MAPK1, or MAPK3 were
detected in these cells (data not shown). We also generated
PFR5þ cells by continued exposure of the PFR5 cells to
PF299804. The PFR5þ and PFR5 and cells were similar in their
growth characteristics, following drug treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7). The removal of PF299804 from the culture media
did not change the resistance phenotype in the PFR3þ cells
(Fig. 4D).
To understand why PFRþ cells emerged so rapidly with
continued drug exposure, we analyzed the proliferation rates of
PFR3 and PFR3þ cells in culture. Compared with the PFR3
cells, the PFR3þ cells had a faster rate of proliferation (Fig. 5A).
In addition, the PFR3þ cells formed greater numbers of
colonies in a clonogenic assay in the presence, but not in the
absence, of PF299804 (Fig. 5A). These differences may be due to
ability of PF299804 to still inhibit ERK1/2 signaling, a known
mediator of cell proliferation, in the PFR3 but not in the PFR3þ

Resistance to Irreversible EGFR Inhibitors

phosphatases that may regulate ERK1/2 signaling, we evaluated whether pharmacologic inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling
using CI-1040 could restore sensitivity to PF299804/
BMS536924. In short-term assays, the addition of the MEK
inhibitor CI-1040 partially restored sensitivity to PF299804/
BMS536924 or WZ4002/BMS536924 in the PFR3þ and WZR4þ
cells, respectively. The effects of CI-1040 were more dramatic in
clonogenic assays where signiﬁcant and almost complete
inhibition of colony formation was observed (Fig. 5B). However, despite inhibition of ERK 1/2 signaling in the PFR3þ cells,
this did not result in apoptosis and only minimally so in WZR
4þ cells (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B).
Our studies suggest that resistance to irreversible EGFR
inhibitors can be mediated by IGF1R signaling. This, however,
seems to be a transient process as additional drug exposure
leads to activation of ERK1/2 signaling. An alternative therapeutic strategy to treating drug resistance is to prevent it from
emerging especially if multiple different drug-resistant clones
are present (such as PFR3 and PFR5) or emerge as a result of
persistent drug treatment (PFR3 and PFR3þ). Given that the
role of IGF1R and ERK1/2 signaling in this process, we wished
to determine whether their inhibition could delay or prevent
the emergence of drug-resistant clones. We thus treated the
parental EGFR TKI-sensitive PC9 cells with either irreversible
EGFR TKIs alone, BMS536924 alone, CI-1040 alone, or with
drug combinations (Fig. 5C). Although resistant colonies
emerged following 3-month exposure to irreversible EGFR
TKIs alone, BMS536924 alone, and CI-1040 alone, we were
unable to isolate any clones from the combination of
PF299804/BMS536924, WZ4002/BMS536924, or WZ4002/CI1040 (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Current strategies to overcome EGFR T790M, the most
common mechanism of acquired resistance to geﬁtinib and

erlotinib, have been relatively ineffective in patients with
EGFR-mutant NSCLC (19, 20). In the present study, we used
2 independent methods to inhibit EGFR T790M in model
systems. These include a mutant-selective EGFR kinase inhibitor, WZ4002, and high concentrations of a clinical irreversible
EGFR kinase inhibitor PF299804. With both agents, we have
previously shown that they can inhibit the growth of cancers
harboring an established EGFR T790M mutation (11, 23). Using
PF299804, inhibition of EGFR T790M occurs only at high
concentrations (>1 mmol/L), which may not be achieved in
patients using current continuous dosing regimens (11, 22).
However, alternative dosing strategies, such as intermittent
pulsatile dosing, may achieve sufﬁcient PF299804 concentrations to inhibit T790M (11). Importantly, using both WZ4002
and high concentrations of PF299804, we prevent the emergence of EGFR T790M in the PC9 cells, which with multiple
investigators have been reproducibly shown to develop EGFR
T790M following exposure to geﬁtinib, erlotinib, or to clinical
concentrations of irreversible EGFR inhibitors (12, 13, 17, 18).
This observation suggests that, if applied clinically, patients
with lung cancer may achieve a longer progression-free survival than is currently possible with geﬁtinib or erlotinib.
A critical goal of our studies was to understand how cancers
develop drug resistance if we are able to fully inhibit EGFR
T790M. Intriguingly, none of our drug-resistant clones harbored a secondary mutation in EGFR. Previous studies have
shown that mutations in the site of covalent binding (C797) can
confer resistance to irreversible EGFR TKIs including WZ4002
(17, 23). Why we do not observe this mutation using our drug
exposure model of resistance remains to be determined.
We found that PC9 cells resistant to either PF299804 or
WZ4002 maintain PI3K/AKT signaling, through activation of
IGF1R signaling, which is in turn mediated by downregulation
of IGFBP3 (Figs. 1–3). This mechanism of acquired resistance
has previously been reported for models of geﬁtinib-sensitive

EGFR wild-type cancers (using A431 cells; ref. 29). Moreover,
Sharma and colleagues observed that PC9 cells could acquire
transient resistance to geﬁtinib through a chromatin change
that is reversible with IGF1R inhibitors (32). Our resistant cells
do not harbor this resistance mechanism (Supplementary Fig.
S4). IGF1R signaling as a mechanism of drug resistance in
EGFR-mutant cancer has not been previously reported with
reversible or irreversible EGFR inhibitors. One potential reason
for these observations is, until recently, the lack of efﬁcacious
therapeutic strategies against EGFR T790M. Several studies
suggest that EGFR T790M preexists in treatment-na€ve cancers
and undergoes a selection process following drug exposure (33,
34). When EGFR T790M is present in just a few rare clones, such
as the PC9 cells, PF299804 effectively prevents its emergence
when used at high concentrations (Fig. 6). In contrast, when
EGFR T790M is already present, inhibition is only transient
followed by selection for EGFR T790M ampliﬁed PFR cells (Fig.
6; ref. 11). Thus outgrowth of an EGFR T790M containing clone
may be an easier or faster means for an EGFR-mutant cancer to
develop drug resistance than activating additional signaling
pathways. This hypothesis is supported by recent clinical
studies that have shown no increase in progression-free survival by the addition of the IGFIR antibody R1507 to erlotinib
compared with erlotinib alone (35).
Models of drug resistance to EGFR TKIs have typically
identiﬁed a single molecular event including EGFR T790M and
MET ampliﬁcation (12, 24) Here, we ﬁnd that the resistance to
PF299804 and WZ4002 occurs through a more dynamic and
multistep process, which could be more reﬂective of clinical
drug resistance. These processes can also occur rapidly as
highlighted by the PFR5 cells (Fig. 1C), which are similar to the
PFR3þ cells but different from the PFR3 cells. Our data suggest
that the ﬁrst step is required for the second step to occur, as we
found that PFR3þ emerged from prolonged exposure of PFR3
cells to PF299804 and inhibition of IGF1R prevented emergence of PFR3þ cells from PC9 cells (Fig. 5B). Resistance
acquired at each step was maintained overtime, suggesting
that these mechanisms are permanent, in contrast to the
mechanism in the drug-tolerant tumor cells that have been
previously described (32). However, with additional drug exposure, in the second step, EGFR could no longer inhibit mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and this pathway
becomes activated through an EGFR-independent mechanism
(Figs. 1C, D and 4C). These cells had a proliferative advantage
over the "ﬁrst-step"–resistant ones, which likely contributed to
their emergence upon continued therapeutic pressure (Fig.
5A). Our ﬁndings further imply that although activation of the
PI3K/AKT pathway is required for resistance to EGFR TKI,
activation of the MAPK pathway may also offer a proliferative
advantage to these cells. However, the resistance is more

complex, as despite inhibiting EGFR and downstream pathways, the PFR3þ cells do not die (Supplementary Fig. S9A and
S9B). Thus the phenotype may involve more than one process
including the inability to undergo apoptosis; a mechanism
recently reported for crizotinib resistance (36). These ﬁndings
highlight the potential clinical challenges in developing therapeutic strategies against just one mechanism of drug
resistance.
An alternative clinical strategy is to identify the spectrum of
potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance and to
inhibit them before they emerge in combination with EGFR
inhibitors (37). By combining an effective strategy to inhibit
EGFR T790M with either an IGF1R or MEK inhibitor, we
prevented the emergence of drug-resistant clones using this
model system. Either one or both of these may be an effective
clinical approach, lead to prolonged progression-free survival
for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and should be tested in
future clinical trials.
