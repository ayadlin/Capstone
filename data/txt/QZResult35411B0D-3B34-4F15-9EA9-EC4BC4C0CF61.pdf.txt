ABSTRACT
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFRTKIs) might be new therapeutic strategies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Here a total of 12,520 patients from 23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
were enrolled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VEGFR-TKIs quantitatively in
advanced NSCLC. Compared with non-VEGFR-TKIs, VEGFR-TKIs regimen significantly
improved progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR): 0.839, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.805-0.874, P < 0.001], objective response rates (ORR) [relative risk
(RR): 1.374, 95% CI: 1.193-1.583, P < 0.001] and disease control rates (DCR) (RR:
1.113, 95% CI: 1.027-1.206, P = 0.009), but not overall survival (OS) (HR: 0.960,
95% CI: 0.921-1.002, P = 0.060) for NSCLC patients. The RR of all-grade neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hemorrhage, fatigue, anorexia, stomatitis, diarrhea,
rash, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) were increased in patients received VEGFRTKIs. As for high-grade (≥ 3) adverse events (AEs), VEGFR-TKIs were associated
with higher RR of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, fatigue, stomatitis,
diarrhea, rash and HFSR. This study demonstrates VEGFR-TKIs improve PFS, ORR and
DCR, but not OS in advanced NSCLC patients. VEGFR-TKIs induce more frequent and
serious AEs compared with control therapies.

INTRODUCTION

[4]. There are two major categories of agents targeting
VEGFR pathway: VEGF antibodies and VEGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs).
Several VEGFR-TKIs have been developed
for targeted therapies in NSCLC, such as sorafenib,
sunitinib, cediranib and vandetanib. The clinical efficacy
of VEGFR-TKIs in advanced NSCLC, as a part of
combination therapies or single agent had been evaluated
[5-10]. But the results were inconsistent. A previous
meta-analysis showed that chemotherapy plus VEGFRTKIs significantly improved the progression-free survival
(PFS), objective response rates (ORR) and disease control
rates (DCR), but not overall survival (OS) [11]. Another
meta-analysis suggested that VEGFR-TKIs significantly
increased risk of death compared with non-VEGFRTKIs [12]. In a recent meta-analysis, Shaodong H et al
demonstrated that angiogenesis inhibitors had significant
advantages over non-angiogenesis inhibitors in terms

Standard therapy for advanced NSCLC is platinumbased palliative chemotherapy. Although 30-50% of
NSCLC patients respond to platinum-based regimens,
the median over survival (OS) is still 8-12 months [1, 2].
Traditional chemotherapy has limited clinical benefits. The
“one size fits all” treatment model must be changed. The
effective and less toxic drugs are urgently needed.
Over the past decade, progress of NSCLC biology
promoted the development of targeted agents. Those
targeted agents specifically inhibit vital signaling
pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor recepter
(VEGFR) [3]. Currently, targeted therapies have emerged
as novel therapeutic options and changed the treatment
paradigm of NSCLC. VEGFR, a critical pathway in tumor
progression, represents an important target in NSCLC

of PFS, OS, ORR and DCR in advanced NSCLC [13].
However, the meta analysis included VEGF antibodybased agents (bevacizumab, aflibercept and ramucirumab).
Since then, several novel randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) are emerging. Furthermore, previous studies
showed different and even contradictory conclusions.
The overall efficacy and safety of VEGFR-TKIs are
undetermined. A more comprehensive review of previous
studies is needed. In this study, we performed a pooled
analysis of currently published RCTs to summarize the up-

to-date evidence.

Finally, only 23 RCTs were included in our study. These
RCTs enrolled a total of 12,520 patients (VEGFR-TKIs
arm: 6487, control arm:6033). Among these 23 studies,
3 were on cediranib [14-16]; 1 on motesanib [10]; 2 on
nintedanib [17, 18]; 1 on pazopanib [19]; 4 on sorafenib
[9, 20-22]; 3 on sunitinib [23-25] and 9 on vandetanib
[5-8, 26-30]. These RCTs comprised 12 phase II and 11
phase III clinical trials. Fourteen studies were published in
recent three years. Eight trials were performed in first-line
settings, 13 in ≥ second-line settings and 2 in maintenance.
VEGFR-TKIs were compared with placebo in 6 trials and
17 trials were chemotherapy plus VEGFR-TKIs versus
chemotherapy alone. The overall study quality was fair
with a median Jadad score of 4, suggesting the quality
of all RCTs was quite good. The characteristics of the 23

RCTs were listed in Table 1.

Progression free survival
Twenty three studies reported the PFS of 6,487
patients in VEGFR-TKIs arm and 6,033 patients in control
arm. Heterogeneity analysis revealed that there was no
significant between-study heterogeneity (chi-squared =
31.88, d.f. = 22, P = 0.079, I-squared = 31.0%). A metaanalysis was therefore carried out using the fixed-effects
model. A statistically significant improvement in PFS was
observed favoring VEGFR-TKIs groups [hazard ratio
(HR): 0.839, 95% confident intervals (CI): 0.805-0.874, P
< 0.001) (Figure 2A).

VEGFR-TKIs monotherapies (HR:0.707, 95%CI: 0.5600.892) and combination therapies of VEGFR-TKIs with
chemotherapy (HR:0.835, 95%CI: 0.798-0.875) (Figure
5A). We further performed meta-regression by the
covariates including individual VEGFR-TKI, treatment

line and treatment regimen. As was found in the subgroup
analysis, individual VEGFR-TKI (P = 0.819), treatment
line (P = 0.416) and treatment regimen (P = 0.261) did not
result in the inter-study heterogeneity (Table 2).

cediranib, nintedanib, sorafenib, sunitinib and vandetanib
(Figure 3B). A positive effect of VEGFR-TKIs for
OS was not observed in first-line treatment, ≥ secondline treatment, and maintenance treatment (Figure

observed in combination therapies of VEGFR-TKIs
with chemotherapy, not in VEGFR-TKIs monotherapies
(Figure 5B). Meta regression suggested that individual

vandetanib) resulted in a significant improvement of
ORR (Figure 3C). Three agents (nintedanib, sunitinib
and vandetanib) resulted in a significant increase of DCR
(Figure 3D). The significant ORR benefit was found both
in first-line and ≥ second-line treatment. However, better
DCR was only found in ≥ second-line treatment (Figure
4D). Subgroup analysis showed that both monotherapy and
combination therapy improved ORR and DCR (Figure 5C,
5D). Meta regression indicated that none of the examined
factors were responsible for between-study heterogeneity
on ORR, including individual VEGFR-TKI (P = 0.975),
treatment line (P = 0.345) and treatment regimen (P =
0.129). In addition, individual VEGFR-TKI (P = 0.938)
and treatment regimen (P = 0.357) did not result in
significantly heterogeneity across studies on DCR. While,
treatment line (P = 0.023) could be a important factor
responsible for between-study heterogeneity on DCR
(Table 2).

Overall response rate and disease control rate
Twenty three RCTs provided information in detail
about ORR, while DCR were suggested in only fifteen
trials. The results of pooled analysis showed VEGFRTKIs significantly improved ORR [relative risk (RR):
1.374, 95%CI: 1.193-1.583, P < 0.001] and DCR (RR:
1.113, 95%CI: 1.027-1.206, P = 0.009) (Figure 2C, 2D).

hemorrhage, thromboembolism, anorexia, dyspnea and
neuropathy (Table 3).

The common AEs were summarized in Table
3. The pooled analyses showed that the risks of allgrade neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension,
hemorrhage, fatigue, anorexia, stomatitis, diarrhea,
rash, HFSR were higher in patients receiving VEGFRTKIs. The pooled RR indicated the risks of all-grade
thromboembolism, dyspnea and neuropathy were
comparable between VEGFR-TKIs and control group.
However, the risk of all-grade anemia was decreased in
patients treated with VEGFR-TKIs than those in control
group (RR:0.820, 95%CI:0.683-0.984).
To clarified the severity of AEs, we further analyzed
the ≥ 3 grade AEs in VEGFR-TKIs and control group.
Compared with the control group, the VEGFR-TKIs
group showed a higher incidence of ≥ 3 grade neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, hypertension, fatigue, stomatitis,
diarrhea, rash and HFSR. Patients receiving VEGFRTKIs experienced a comparable risk of ≥ 3 grade anemia,

Sensitivity analyses
We carried out sensitivity analyses to assess the
stability of the results by sequentially omitting each study.
The leave-one-out sensitivity analyses indicated that no
individual study changed the pooled data qualitatively,
suggesting that our results were stable and reliable (Figure
6).

Publication bias
The Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s test were
conducted to assess the publication bias. The shapes of
the funnel plots seemed symmetrical in all meta-analyses,
suggesting the absence of publication bias (Figure 7).

analysis on PFS was 0.98 (P = 0.328), 1.02 on OS (P =
0.310), 0.42 on ORR (P = 0.673) and 1.04 on DCR (P
= 0.299). Egger’s test showed that the t value (bias) of
the meta-analyses on PFS was -1.54 (P = 0.138), 0.79 OS
(P = 0.439), 0.12 on ORR (P = 0.439) and 0.99 on DCR
(P = 0.338). As shown in Table 2, the results of Begg’s
test and Egger’s test indicated no significant evidence
for publication bias of the subgroup analyses. Bias from
publications might not have a significant influence on the
results of current meta-analyses. Therefore, we did not
perform non-parametric “trim-and-fill” method to adjust
pooled HRs or RRs.

Thus, VEGFR-TKIs result in regression of blood vessels,
suppression of tumor angiogenesis and shrinkage of tumor
volume.
Our results demonstrated significant association
between improvement of PFS and VEGFR-TKIs
(HR:0.839, 95%CI: 0.805-0.874, P < 0.001). However,
the improvement of PFS with VEGFR-TKIs failed to
translate into OS benefit (Figure 2). Our results were
consistent with previous studies (11,13,20-36). One
possible explanation is that PFS is a direct indicator for
treatment efficacy, while the OS may be influenced by
the post-progression treatment. Patients in VEGFRTKIs group have longer PFS than control group. The
improvement of symptom relief results in the possibility
that patients could live with fewer symptoms for a longer
time. Patients in control groups would receive more postprogression interventions. Therefore, they get important
palliative benefit compared with patients in VEGFR-TKIs
groups [11]. Another possible explanation is that tumor
upregulates the expression of alternative pro-angiogenic
factors, such as fibroblast growth factor, ephrin and
angiopoietin after VEGFR-TKIs treatment [32]. Those
factors compensate quickly the inhibition of VEGFR
signal pathway. The exact reasons remain unclear. Thus,
further studies with functional analyses are needed to

DISCUSSION
The present report with updated data improved our
understanding about the efficacy and safety of VEGFRTKIs in advanced NSCLC. The pooled results showed
that VEGFR-TKIs were associated with significant
improvement in PFS, ORR and DCR compared with
control therapies. The basis of VEGFR-TKIs therapy is
stemmed from recognition of the fact that VEGF is the
most important growth factor for angiogenesis [4, 31].
VEGFR-TKIs compete with ATP for the activation domain
and block intracellular VEGF signaling pathway [31].

address this issue.
In the present meta-analysis, we found the spectrum
of VEGFR-TKIs associated AEs was consistent with
previous studies [11, 13, 33]. Hypertension is a wellknown AE of VEGFR-TKIs. VEGFR-TKIs induce
vasoconstriction by inhibition flow-mediated dilation
and nitroglycerin- mediated dilation [34]. Interestingly,
occurrence of treatment-related hypertension is associated
with benefit of VEGFR-TKIs [35]. However, it is unclear
whether hypertension might exploited as an indicator for
better PFS and OS in patients treated with VEGFR-TKIs.
VEGF signal pathway plays a vital role in hematopoiesis.
So, VEGFR-TKIs may lead to neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia. However, the novel thing is that the
risk of all-grade anemia was decreased in patients treated
with VEGFR-TKIs (RR:0.820, 95%CI:0.683-0.984). One
possible reason is the potential benefit of VEGFR-TKIs
for reduction tumor burden. Another reason might be
related to the increase of erythropoietin induced by antiangiogenic effect [36]. But the mechanism is not fully
understood and further studies are needed.
In 2014, nintedanib (BIBF1120), under the brand
name vargatef, was approved in European Union as a
second line agent in advanced lung adenocarcinoma [17,
37]. Recent scientific evidence showed that nintedanib in
combination with docetaxel prolonged survival of patients
with advanced lung adenocarcinoma [37]. Nintedanib is
a triple angiokinase inhibitor that simultaneously blocks
VEGFR, PDGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptors
proangiogenic pathways [38]. These three cellular
signal pathways have an important role in angiogenesis,
progression and metastasis of malignant tumors [3, 4,
39]. Several novel VEGFR-TKIs are also under clinical
investigation. Angiogenesis is imperative for the tumor
growth and metastasis. The formation and remodeling
of vessels is mediated by stimulating molecules released
from malignant cells [4, 40]. The stimulating molecules
activate cellular signal pathways resulting in new vessels
formation. VEGFR-TKIs inhibit sprouting of the vessels
through blocking those activating signal pathways [31, 33].
Unlike classical cytotoxic drugs, VEGFR-TKIs have no
direct cell-killing effect on malignant cells. Conventional
chemotherapy drugs could directly kill normal and
cancerous cells through inhibiting proliferation, interfering
metabolism or/and inducing apoptosis. Taken together, the
combination of VEGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy results
in considerable malignant cells death and rapid tumor
shrinkage [32, 37]. One of the advantages is that it shows
more effective anti-cancer activity than chemotherapy
agent alone. Another advantage is that combination
therapy could reduce the dose of cytotoxic drugs, and
minimize normal cells death caused by cytotoxic drugs.
Previous studies showed that hypoxia expedited
tumor invasion and metastasis by inducing hepatocyte
growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) [41, 42].
One interesting question attracts our attention: whether
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

VEGFR-TKIs drive tumor progression and metastasis in
hypoxia. The shifting from normoxia (21% O2) to hypoxia
indeed activates cancer cells for aggressive behavior [41].
However, “normoxia” defined as 21% O2 (160 mmHg) is
not physiological. The oxygen levels in advanced NSCLC
is just about 1% (5 mmHg) [43]. VEGFR-TKIs shift
malignant cells from hypoxia (the normal oxygen level in
NSCLC) to deeper hypoxia or anoxia. The metastasis and
invasion of cancer is stimulated by physiological hypoxia
not inflicting hypoxia [44]. VEGFR-TKIs exhaust oxygen
and starve cells to death. Thus, metastasis may not occur
during VEGFR-TKIs therapy [44, 45]. Effective anticancer therapy suppresses proliferation of sensitive cells
and only resistant cells survive. The ideal anti-cancer
therapy suppresses all malignant cells. There may be no
residual cells. Currently, VEGFR-TKIs therapy is limited
mainly by low efficacy and shortage of selective drugs.
Blagosklonny MV had proposed strategies to increase
efficacy: combination of VEGFR-TKIs with metronomic
chemotherapy, anti-HIF drugs and inactive prodrugs [44].
Given various potential therapeutic methods, we can
imagine effective VEGFR-TKIs therapies of the future.
According to our data, VEGFR-TKIs improved
PFS, ORR and DCR in advanced NSCLC. Disappointedly,
clinical responses to VEGFR-TKIs therapy did not
translate into OS improvements. Another interesting
question attracts our attention: why therapeutic responses
to VEGFR-TKIs do not prolong the survival of NSCLC
patients. Anti-cancer therapies kill proliferating cells
and cause remission. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) persist in
residual tumor and lead to relapse. All proliferating cells
are descendance of the same CSCs. The life expectancy
of relapsed tumor is identical to that of initial tumor. So,
anti-cancer therapies extend patients’ OS time between
remission and relapse [46]. However, anti-cancer therapies
cannot kill all proliferating cells in NSCLC. Inevitably,
CSCs hierarchy shifts to the dominance of proliferating
cells [47]. Anti-cancer therapies select proliferating
cells with resistance-confirming mutations. Resistant
proliferating cells will be attenuated by differentiation,
unless proliferating cells acquire the potential for selfrenewal [47]. Once the oncogenic resistant mutations
render proliferating cells drug-resistant, apoptosisreluctant and highly malignant, more aggressive relapse
tumors may occur. The relapse tumor tends to be more
lethal compared to initial tumor. Therefore, there is no
improvement of OS. Selection for oncogenic resistance
can explain the response-survival paradox. VEGFR-TKIs
could improve survival of patients as long as acquired
resistance is exploited.
In this meta analysis, the AEs of VEGFR-TKIs were
various, because several VEGFR-TKIs are multitargeted
tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cediranib inhibits VEGFR,
PDGFR, and c-kit. Sorafenib can inhibit VEGFR and
PDGFR tyrosine kinase as well as the Raf kinases.
Vandetanib is a potent inhibitor of RET receptor tyrosine

kinase, VEGFR and EGFR pathways [40]. The wide
clinical use of VEGFR-TKIs has raised concerns over
their AEs. Thus, an emerging issue is to identify the
predictor for selecting patients who benefit from VEGFRTKIs. Although several markers have been postulated,
such as VEGF, MMP-9 and IL-8 [48], no biomarker has
yet been used routinely in NSCLC. So, predictive markers
are greatly needed to identify the subset of patients who
may gain the utmost benefit from VEGFR-TKIs.
This meta analysis comprehensively analyzed data
from different studies to achieve a more robust results.
However, several limitations need to be addressed. First,
this meta analysis was based on study-level evidence.
Thus, confounding factors (demographic characteristics
and post-progression treatment) could not be incorporated
into analysis. An individual patient data-based metaanalysis would give more reliable results. Second, due
to lack of original data, we did not perform sub-analysis
based on predictive markers to identify the exact benefit
population. Third. our conclusions came from the sum of
23 RCTs; 6 of which were the comparison between case
and placebo; 17 of which were the comparison between
TKI added on chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone.
The little heterogeneity across studies may enhance the
reliability of this study. Although subgroup analyses
and meta regression both demonstrated the regimen did
not change the overall results significantly, inconsistent
HRs and RRs for different regimen should be noticed.
Therefore, further research with updated data from
individual patient are needed to clarify the efficacy and
safety of VEGFR-TKIs.

Results from the initial search that matched the
criteria below were eligible. (a) Individuals with advanced
NSCLC must be histopathologically confirmed. (b) The
studies must be prospective randomized controlled phase
II or phase III trials on advanced NSCLC patients. (c) No
patient received VEGFR-TKIs or anti-VEGFR antibodies
treatment before the randomized controlled trials. (d) The
studies must reported one of the four endpoints (PFS, OS,
ORR or DCR). For full text review, trials were excluded if
(a) clinical trials compared VEGFR-TIKs with anti-VEGF
antibodies; (b) data were not available regarding primary
or secondary end points; (c) the number of patients for
the AEs assessment was not provided; (d) patients with
small cell lung cancer or other malignancies or benign
lung tumors; (e) patients were not randomized into
different groups. If the same patient population was used
in more than one study, only the complete study would be
included.

Data extraction and definition
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta analyses (PRISMA) statements were
used to provide complete information about this meta
analysis [49]. The 27 items of PRISMA statements
were shown in Supplement Checklist 1, which included
the title, abstract, methods, results, discussion and
funding. According to PRISMA statements, all data were
independently extracted by two authors using standardised
data compilation forms. The discrepancies were resolved
by discussion to validate the accuracy of extraction. The
primary end point was defined as PFS to standardize data
collection. The secondary end points included OS, ORR,
DCR as well as common AEs. The DFS was defined as
the time from random assignment to disease progression.
The OS time was calculated from random assignment to
the date of death from any cause. Tumor response was
defined as progressive disease, stable disease, partial
response or complete response based on the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria [50]. The
ORR was defined as the proportion of patients showing
complete or partial response. The DCR included stable
disease, partial response and complete response for
longer than three months. Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE 3.0) was used to grade
the severity of AEs. The quality of included RCTs was
assessed according to Jadad scale [51].

Meeting abstracts from the American society of Clinical
Oncology, World Congress of Lung Cancer and European
Cancer Organization were also hand searched. We also
screened the reference lists of review articles and original

Statistical analysis
HRs and corresponding 95% CIs were pooled for
PFS and OS. The HRs and 95% CIs were extracted as
previously reported [52-54]. The most accurate method
was to obtain parameters directly from the articles or to
calculate the HRs from O-E statistic and variance. The

second method was to estimate the HRs from sample size,
survival rate at specified times, log rank statistic and P
value. Otherwise, Kaplan-Meier Curves were analyzed
using the Engauge Digitizer version 4.1 (http://digitizer.
sourceforge.net/) to retrieved HRs and 95% CIs. For
measurement of RRs and their 95% CIs, we constructed
2×2 tables based on abstracted data from each RCTs. RRs
and their 95% CIs were pooled to evaluate overall ORR,
DCR and risk of AEs.
The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to determine
the choice of the fixed effects model or the random-effects
model. A sensitivity analysis was carried out by excluding
each study at a time individually. The publication bias
was analysed using Begg’s funnel plots and Egger’s linear
regression test [55]. P < 0.05 by t-test was defined as
significant publication bias. Despite little heterogeneity
across studies, meta regression was performed to evaluate
potential effects of clinical covariables on overall
outcomes. Three categorical variable were investigated,
including drug class, treatment line and regimens.
Univariate meta-regression analyses were carried out
using the random-effects model. The restricted maximum
likelihood method was undertaken to estimate the residual
between-trial variance and heterogeneity degree [56].
Monte Carlo permutation test was used with 10,000
random permutations [57]. This meta-analysis was carried
out using the software Stata 11.0 (Stata Corporation,
College Station, TX, USA). All the P values were twosided. Differences were considered statistically significant
at P < 0.05.

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

In summary, this study provides proof of principle
that VEGFR-TKIs have an advantage in terms of PFS,
ORR and DCR, compared with control therapies.
However, advanced NSCLC patients treated with VEGFRTKIs have high risks of AEs. Thus, the monitoring AEs
during VEGFR-TKIs therapy is recommended. The risk
and benefit of VEGFR-TKIs must be evaluated carefully
to select patients who utmost benefit from VEGFR-TKIs
treatment.
