ABSTRACT
This study was conducted with objective of evaluating the toxic effects of
nickel chloride (NiCl2) on development of bursa of Fabricius in broilers fed on diets
supplemented with 0, 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg of NiCl2 for 42 days by using the
methods of experimental pathology, flow cytometry (FCM), and quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that dietary NiCl2 in
300 mg/kg and over induced toxic suppression in the bursal development, which was
characterized by decreasing lymphocytes histopathologically and relative weight,
increasing G0/G1 phase (a prolonged nondividing state), reducing S phase (DNA
replication) and proliferating index, and increasing percentages of apoptotic cells.
Concurrently, the mRNA expression levels of bax, cytochrome c (cyt c), apoptotic
peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7 and caspase-9
were increased and the bcl-2 mRNA expression levels were decreased. The toxic
suppression of bursal development finally impaired humoral immunity duo to the
reduction of B lymphocyte population and B lymphocyte activity in the broiler chicken.
This study provides new evidences for further studying the effect mechanism of Ni
and Ni compounds on B-cell or bursa of Fabricius.

INTRODUCTION

19]. Ni (II) can directly generate ROS, activate caspase-3
expression, increase caspase-3-like protease activity,
and then cause cell death in mice [20, 21]. Our previous
studies have shown that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300
mg/kg causes oxidative damage, lesions, immunotoxicity,
cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, cytokine content reduction,
apoptosis and inflammatory response in the cecal tonsil,
spleen, thymus, kidney and intestine [22-37]. In humans,
persons are exposed to Ni or Ni compounds via food,
water, and air produced from sources such as mining,
extraction, refining, electroplating, food processing, and
waste disposal [38]. After accidently drinking water
contaminated with Ni sulfate (NiSO2) and NiCl2 (1.63g
Ni/L), workers can develop acute gastrointestinal and
neurological symptoms [39]. Based on the abovementioned reports, Ni and Ni compound toxic effects
on humans and animals, or/and Ni and Ni compound
contamination of food and water have been a big problem
in the environmental safety and public health.
The bursa of Fabricius has been found only in the
bird and is located between the cloaca and the sacrum.

Nickel (Ni), an essential element of more than
one hundred compounds used widely in industry and
commerce, is also considered to be a nutritionally essential
trace metal for several animal species, microorganisms
and plants [1-4]. However, there have been more reports
on Ni or Ni compound toxicity than on Ni nutritional
deficiency at present. Ni or Ni compounds have been
proved to be potentially hazardous to living organisms due
to their genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, mutagenicity and
carcinogenicity [5-7]. In rats, nickel chloride (NiCl2) at a
level of 1200 mg/kg can cause weight loss and reduction
of food intake [8]. Ling and Leach [9] have reported
that diets supplemented with Ni 300 mg/kg or over are
toxic to male chicks. It has been also proved that longterm exposure to Ni is deleterious to the upper respiratory
tract, skin, kidney, immune system [10-13], embryos, and
the breeding system [14-16], and that Ni causes DNA
damage and inhibits DNA repair in mammalian cells [17www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Changes of relative weight in the bursa of
Fabricius

It is the primary lymphoid organ, and is necessary for
B-cell differentiation, development and maturation, and is
responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the
B-cell compartment in avian species [40-42]. Thus, bursae
may be used as a good model for studies on effects of
many factors on B-cell function. However, there have been
no reports focused on the toxic effects of NiCl2 on bursa of
Fabricius in avian species at present.
Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate
toxic effects of NiCl2 on bursal development, including
histopathological lesions and changes of relative weight,
cell cycle phase, percentages of apoptotic bursa cells and
the mRNA expression levels of mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway-related factors [bcl-2, bax , cytochrome c (cyt
c), apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1),
caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7 and caspase-9] by using
the methods of experimental pathology, flow cytometry
(FCM), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR).

The relative weight of the bursa was significantly
lower (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/
kg and 900 mg/kg groups than those in the control group
from 7 to 42 days of age, as shown in Figure 7.

Changes of cell cycle in the bursa of Fabricius
From 14 to 42 days of age during the experiment,
the percentages of G0/G1 phase (a prolonged nondividing
state) were significantly increased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01)
in the 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg groups.
The percentages of the G2+M phase were lower (P
< 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg and 900
mg/kg groups than those in the control group from 14 to
42 days of age.
The percentages of S phase (DNA replication) were
significantly decreased (P < 0.01) in the 300 mg/kg, 600
mg/kg and 900 mg/kg groups when compared with those
in the control group at 14, 28 and 42 days of age.
The proliferating index (PI) value was markedly
lower (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg
and 900 mg/kg groups than that in the control group from
14 to 42 days of age.
The abovementioned results were shown in Figures
8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.

RESULTS
Clinical observation
From 14 to 42 days of age during the experiment,
the feed intake of broilers in the 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg,
and 900 mg/kg groups began to decline when compared
with those in the control group, except the 300 mg/kg
group at 14 days of age. From 21 to 42 days of age during
the experiment, broilers in the 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, and
900 mg/kg groups showed poor appetite, poor growth and
depression. A few broilers showed polypnea. No death was
found during the experiment.

Changes of apoptosis in the bursa of Fabricius
From 14 to 42 days of age during the experiment, the
percentages of apoptotic cells in the bursa were increased
in the NiCl2-treated groups. The apoptotic percentages
were significantly higher (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 300
mg/kg, 600 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg groups than those in the
control group, as shown in Figures 13 and 14.

Histopathological observation in the bursa of
Fabricius
Histopathological changes were observed in the
three NiCl2-treated groups when compared with those
in the control group from 14 to 42 days of age. Also,
histopathological changes showed obvious time- and
dose-characterization. At 14 days of age, lymphocytes
were slightly reduced in lymphoid follicles. At 21 and
28 days of age, lymphocytes were obviously decreased
in lymphoid follicles with thinner cortices and wider
medullae. At 35 and 42 days of age, lymphocytes were
significantly decreased in lymphoid follicles with thinner
cortices and wider medullae. The results were shown in
Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

At 14, 28 and 42 days of age during the experiment,
the bax, cyt c, Apaf-1, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7
and caspase-9 mRNA expression levels were significantly
increased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 300 mg/kg, 600
mg/kg and 900 mg/kg groups when compared with
those in the control group. However, the bcl-2 mRNA
expression levels were significantly lower (P < 0.05 or
P < 0.01) in the NiCl2-treated groups than those in the
control group from 14 to 42 days of age. The results were
shown in Figure 15.

DISCUSSION

impaired the bursal function, which was consistent with
the cell cycle arrest.
In order to reveal how NiCl2 induced bursal relative
weight reduction or growth suppression, we used FCM
to measure the cell cycle of bursal lymphocytes. The
results showed that NiCl2 induced cell cycle arrest at
the G0/G1 phase, which inhibited damaged cells to stop
DNA replication at G1 phase, and ultimately resulted in
apoptosis of the cells when damaged cells could not be
repaired. The above-mentioned observation was supported
by the findings that NiCl2 decreased bursal lymphocyte
numbers in the S phase and reduced proliferating index,
and increased percentages of apoptotic lymphocytes of the
bursa. It is clear that the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
of bursal lymphocytes are direct evidences of toxic
suppression of the bursa of Fabricius induced by dietary
NiCl2.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxic
effects of dietary NiCl2 on bursal growth. In the present
study, dietary NiCl2 in 300 mg/kg and over was indeed
found to have toxic effects on bursa of Fabricius, including
histopathological lesions (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), reduced
relative weight (Figure 7), arrested cell-cycle (Figures 8,
9, 10, 11, 12) and increased apoptosis (Figures 13 and 14).
It is well known that relative weight, as a satisfactory
measure of nutritive value, can also represent the growth
state of organs. In the present study, the relative weight of
bursa was used to judge the bursal growth. The relative
weight of bursa in NiCl2-treated groups was lower than
that in control group, implying that dietary NiCl2 in 300
mg/kg and over inhibited the bursal development, and then

Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death
morphologically characterized by chromatin condensation,
DNA and nuclear fragmentation, cytoplasmic shrinkage
and formation of apoptotic bodies [43]. Inappropriately
regulated apoptosis is implicated in an extensive variety
of diseases [44]. In our study, the increased apoptotic
lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius were observed in the
three NiCl2-treated groups by FCM, which was consistent
with the mRNA expression alteration of apoptotic
proteins. It was found in the present study that dietary
NiCl2 increased bax, cyt c, Apaf-1, caspase-3, caspase-6,
caspase-7 and caspase-9 mRNA expression levels, and
decreased bcl-2 mRNA expression levels, which explained
the occurrence of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in the
bursa of Fabricius because increase of pro-apoptotic or
reduction of anti-apoptotic genes could push cells down
the apoptotic pathway.
The apoptotic process is mediated by the bcl-2

family proteins and performs in Fas pathway or caspaseindependent apoptotic pathway which relies on the
mitochondrial active control [45]. Bcl-2 family is classified
into anti-apoptotic proteins such as bcl-2 and bcl-xL,
which reduces the level of cyt c release [46] and proapoptotic proteins such as bax and bak, which induces the
release of cyt c and a loss of the mitochondrial membrane
potential [47]. The cyt c release is the main steps in the
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [48-50]. After being
released, cyt c is immediately combined with Apaf -1,
and then activates caspase family to induce apoptosis
[51]. Caspases are central mediators of apoptosis [52].
Nevertheless, bcl-2-like proteins can prevent bax-induced
cell death by blocking cyt c release [53]. The present
study showed that mRNA expression levels of bcl-2, bax,
cyt c, Apaf1, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, caspase-9
in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways had significant
difference between control group and NiCl2-treated

groups. The results of our study are similar to reports that
exposure of A549 cells to Ni ferrite nanoparticles [54]
results in significant increase in mRNA expression levels
of cell cycle checkpoint protein p53 and apoptotic proteins
(bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9).
Cell cycle arrest and increased apoptotic
percentages contributed to the decrease in bursal
lymphocytes, which was supported strongly and directly
by histopathological evidences. Histopathologically,
bursal lymphocytes were decreased with obvious timeand dose-characterization. Simultaneously, dietary NiCl2
has been reported to induce toxicity in the immune organ
or tissue, such as spleen, thymus and cecal tonsil [22, 29,
31-33]. B lymphocytes take part in humoral immunity.

Thus, the humoral immune function is finally impaired
due to the decreased B lymphocyte numbers and reduced
B lymphocyte activities in the peripheral blood and
lymphatic organ or tissue caused by dietary NiCl2.
In conclusion, dietary NiCl2 in 300 mg/kg and
over induces toxic suppression in the bursal growth by
decreasing lymphocytes histopathologically and relative
weight, arresting cell cycle, and increasing apoptosis
percentage. The toxic suppression of bursal growth finally
impairs humoral immunity duo to the reduction of B
lymphocyte population and B lymphocyte activity in the
chicken. This study provides new evidences for further
studying the effect mechanism of Ni and Ni compounds
on B-cell or bursa of Fabricius.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Determination of cell cycle in the bursa of
Fabricius by FCM

Broilers and diets

At 14, 28, and 42 days of age, the bursae of five
broilers in each group were selected for determination of
the cell-cycle by using FCM, as described by Cui et al.
[56].
Bursae were immediately removed and ground to
form a cell suspension that was filtered through 300-mesh
nylon screen. The cells were suspended in 1×binding
buffer at a concentration of 1×106 cells/mL after washing
the cells twice with cold phosphate buffer solution (PBS)
(pH 7.2-7.4). Five hundred microliters of the solution was
transferred to a 5mL culture tube and centrifuged (5001,000 rpm). After removing the supernatant, 5μL 0.25%
Triton X-100 and 5μL propidium iodide were added to the
tube. Then the cells were gently vortexed and incubated
for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. Finally, 500μL PBS was
added to each tube, and the contents were analyzed by
FCM (BD FACSCalibur) within 45 min.

A total of 280 one-day-old healthy avian broilers
were randomly divided into four groups of 70 broilers in
each group. The broilers were housed in separate cages
with electrically heated units and were provided with
water and the control or experimental diets ad libitum
for 42 days. The commercial broilers’ growth cycle
is about 42 days, and then they will be put into use for
consumption. In this period they grow rapidly and a lot of
diet will be consumed, and broilers will easily affected by
diet containing metal pollutants (such as Ni). The aim of
our study is to evaluate the effect of dietary NiCl2 on the
broilers in the period of growth.
All experimental procedures involving broilers were
approved by Animal Care and Use Committee, Sichuan
Agricultural University.
A corn-soybean basal diet formulated by the
National Research Council [55] was the control diet.
NiCl2∙6H2O (Cheng Du Kelong Chemical Co., Ltd.,
Chengdu, China) was mixed into the corn-soybean basal
diet to produce experimental diets with 300, 600, and 900
mg/kg of NiCl2, respectively.

Determination of apoptosis in the bursa of
Fabricius by FCM
At 14, 28, and 42 days of age, the bursae of five
broilers in each group were selected for determination of
the bursal apoptotic lymphocytes using FCM, as described
by Peng et al. [57].
The cell suspension was prepared as described in
the method of cell of cycle. One hundred microliters of
the solution was transferred to a 5 mL culture tube, then
subsequently adding 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl
of propidium iodide to the tube. The cells were gently
vortexed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature
(25 °C) in the dark. Four hundred microliters of 1×binding
buffer was added to each tube and analyzed by FCM
within 1 h.

Clinical signs and the relative weight of bursa of
Fabricius
Clinical signs were observed and recorded daily. At
7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days of age during the experiment,
five broilers in each group were humanely killed. Bursa
was taken from each broiler and weighed after dissecting
connective tissue around the organ. Relative weight of
bursa was calculated by the following formula:
Relative weight = organ weight (g)/body weight
(kg)

Histopathological observation

Detection of apoptotic protein mRNA expression
levels by qRT-PCR

At 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days of age, five broilers
in each group were humanely killed, and the bursae
were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde and routinely
processed in paraffin. Thin sections (5 μm) of each tissue
were sliced from each block and mounted on glass. Slices
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E), and then
were examined under an Olympus light microscope.

At 14, 28, and 42 days of age during the
experiment, the bursae from five broilers in each group
were respectively stored in liquid nitrogen. Adding
liquid nitrogen, the samples were homogenized using
a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted from the
powder of bursa of Fabricius by RNA isolate (RNAiso)
Plus (9108/9109, Takara, Japan). Then the total RNA
reverse transcribed into cDNA using a Prim-Script™
RT reagent Kit (RR047A, Takara, Japan) according
to the manufacture’s introduce. The cDNA was used
as a template for quantitative real-time PCR analysis.

Table 1: A list of primers in qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression of the apoptotic proteins

Sequences for primers of bcl-2, bax, cyt c, Apaf-1,
caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7 and caspase-9 and β-Actin
were obtained from Genbank and NCBI. Primers were
designed with Primer 5 software and synthesized at BGI
Tech (Shenzhen, China) (Table 1).
For qRT-PCR reactions, 25 μL mixtures were made
by using SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM II (DRR820A, Takara)
containing 12.5 μL SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM II, 1.0μL of
forward and 1.0 μL of reverse primer, 8.5 μL ribonuclease
(RNase)-free water and 2 μL cDNA. The real-time PCR
reaction conditions were consisted of 3 min at 95 °C (first
segment, one cycle), 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at Tm of a
specific primer pair (second segment, 44 cycles) followed
by 10 s at 95 °C, and 72 °C for 10 s (dissociation curve
segment) using Thermal Cycler (C1000, BIO RAD, USA).
Gene expression values of control group at 14, 28, and 42
days of age were respectively used for gene expression
calibration respectively. The results from the qRT-PCR
were analyzed with 2-ΔΔCT assay [58] and β-Actin was used
as an internal control gene.
