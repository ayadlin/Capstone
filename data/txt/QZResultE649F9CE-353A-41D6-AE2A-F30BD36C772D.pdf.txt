ABSTRACT
We have utilized a two-stage study design to search for SNPs associated with
the survival of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Our
initial GWS data set consisted of 805 Finnish breast cancer cases (360 treated with
adjuvant chemotherapy). The top 39 SNPs from this stage were analyzed in three
independent data sets: iCOGS (n=6720 chemotherapy-treated cases), SUCCESS-A
(n=3596), and POSH (n=518). Two SNPs were successfully validated: rs6500843 (any
chemotherapy; per-allele HR 1.16, 95% C.I. 1.08-1.26, p=0.0001, p(adjusted)=0.0091),
and rs11155012 (anthracycline therapy; per-allele HR 1.21, 95% C.I. 1.08-1.35,
p=0.0010, p(adjusted)=0.0270). The SNP rs6500843 was found to specifically interact
with adjuvant chemotherapy, independently of standard prognostic markers
(p(interaction)=0.0009), with the rs6500843-GG genotype corresponding to the highest
hazard among chemotherapy-treated cases (HR 1.47, 95% C.I. 1.20-1.80). Upon
trans-eQTL analysis of public microarray data, the rs6500843 locus was found to
associate with the expression of a group of genes involved in cell cycle control,
notably AURKA, the expression of which also exhibited differential prognostic value
between chemotherapy-treated and untreated cases in our analysis of microarray
data. Based on previously published information, we propose that the eQTL genes
may be connected to the rs6500843 locus via a RBFOX1-FOXM1 -mediated regulatory
pathway.

the phenotypic spectrum of the disease, with both highpenetrance and common variants associating with various
histopathological features, most notably estrogen receptor
status [3].

indicated treatment for breast cancer is influenced by tumor
grade, stage, HER2 expression, and hormone receptor
status [4, 5], and it is plausible that genetic variants
associated with these features would be of prognostic
and predictive interest. Additionally, genetic variation
may contribute to breast cancer survival independently of
these markers, potentially by affecting the efficacy of the
treatment. For example, prognostic and predictive SNPs
have been reported in the TP53 gene and its regulatory
network, as well as in genes involved in oxidative stress
[6-10]. Such findings have emerged primarily from
candidate gene based approaches, as more comprehensive
GWS-based survival analyses tend to be problematic due
to issues of statistical power: very large sample sizes are
required to reach GWS significance. The collaborative
iCOGS genotyping project [2] now enables this type of
a study, with over 30,000 genotyped breast cancer cases
eligible for survival analysis, of which 17828 cases have
adjuvant treatment information available, although it can
still be challenging to detect modest effect sizes in smaller
subgroups, such as genetic effects that modulate survival
after a specific type of adjuvant treatment.
We have utilized a two-stage study design to search
for genetic variants associated with survival after adjuvant
chemotherapy in breast cancer. First, we conducted an
initial pilot GWS in an event-enriched set of 805 Finnish
breast cancer cases. We then sought to validate our
findings in an independent validation material consisting
of three separate studies: iCOGS [2], POSH [11], and
SUCCESS-A (dbGaP Study Accession: phs000547.v1.p1).
SNPs associated with survival after treatment were further
characterized using eQTL analysis in two large gene
expression data sets and subsequent in silico analyses.

associated hazard ratio > 3.0. In total, we identified 45
putative hits from this Stage I pilot that were represented
by 39 nominal and tagging SNPs on the iCOGS chip
(Supplementary Table 1).
The candidate SNPs from Stage I were then
analyzed in Stage II, comprising of the iCOGS, POSH
and SUCCESS-A data sets. All Stage II survival analyses
were restricted to cases who had received adjuvant
chemotherapy. The analyses were run under the additive
genetic model with left-truncated follow-up times,
adjusted for patient age at diagnosis, and (in the case of
iCOGS) stratified by study. Ten-year overall survival
(death from any cause) was used as the end-point in these
analyses for reasons of data availability and consistency.
Three of the SNPs were statistically significant at this
stage (Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p < 0.05): rs6500843
(any chemotherapy; HR 1.16, 95% C.I. 1.08 - 1.26, p =
0.0001, p(adjusted) = 0.0091); rs4502225 (any chemotherapy;
HR 0.78, 95% C.I. 0.67 - 0.90, p = 0.0007, p(adjusted) =
0.0263); and rs11155012 (anthracycline therapy; HR 1.21,
95% C.I. 1.08 - 1.35, p = 0.0010, p(adjusted) = 0.0270)(Table
1). Of these, the calculated hazard ratio for rs4502225 was
in the opposite direction than in Stage I, and therefore this
SNP cannot be considered a validated hit.
Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of both the
Stage I and Stage II data sets, resulting in very slight
improvement in the precision of the per-allele HR
estimates for the remaining two SNPs: HR 1.18 (95%
C.I. 1.10 – 1.27; p = 6.96 × 10-6) for rs6500843 in the
chemotherapy-treated group, and HR 1.23 (95% C.I. 1.11 –
1.37; p = 8.41 × 10-5) for rs11155012 in the anthracyclinetreated group. See Figure 1 for forest plots displaying
hazard ratios from Stage I and Stage II data sets, as well
as from individual participant studies within the iCOGS
data set. We detected nominally significant heterogeneity
(p = 0.048) among the data sets in the rs6500843 analysis,
indicating some disagreement between data sets; the
SNP-associated increased hazard was not seen in the
SUCCESS-A data set. No heterogeneity was observed in
the case of rs11155012 (p = 0.415). Neither rs6500843 nor
rs11155012 were associated with tumor histopathological
characteristics (Supplementary Table 2), nor were the
survival analyses described above adjusted for patient
or tumor characteristics except age at diagnosis. More
detailed phenotypes were taken into account in the
subsequent interaction analyses (see below).

RESULTS
rs6500843 and rs11155012 are associated with
survival after adjuvant chemotherapy
Initially, a genome-wide study (Stage I: HEBCSGWS; n = 805) was conducted to discover candidate SNPs
that may be associated with breast cancer survival, with
an emphasis on treatment-based subgroups. This initial
stage of the analysis was carried out using three different
endpoints in parallel: five-year BDDM (breast cancer
death or distant metastasis), 10-year breast cancer specific
survival, and 10-year overall survival, using a codominant
genetic model (test for heterogeneity between genotypes).
We used fairly lenient statistical criteria to select candidate
SNPs at this stage: a SNP would be selected for validation
if it fulfilled any of the following criteria: 1) main effect p
< 10-4 and p < 0.01 among chemotherapy-treated cases, 2)
p < 10-4 among chemotherapy-treated cases, or 3) p < 10-3
among chemotherapy-treated cases and a homozygotewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Next, we investigated whether the observed survival
effects are specific to the chemotherapy-treated subgroup,
and whether these effects occur independently of standard
prognostic factors. To this end, we tested for interaction
between treatment and the rs6500843 and rs11155012

data set, as it contains both treated and non-treated cases
in abundant numbers, enabling robust interaction testing.
A likelihood-ratio test comparing models with interaction
terms with models with only independent covariates
indicated an interactive effect between rs6500843 and
adjuvant chemotherapy (p(interaction) = 0.0009, N = 9680
[1176 events]; Table 2), consistent with the finding
that the SNP was associated with survival in the “any
chemotherapy” subset in univariate analysis. See Figure
2 for a visualization of rs6500843-associated survival
within the chemotherapy-treated and untreated subgroups
in the iCOGS data set. Consistent with the additive model
employed in the survival analyses, the genotype-specific
hazard ratios for rs6500843 in the chemotherapy-treated
group increase in an allele dose dependent manner (HR(AG)
= 1.22 (95% C.I. 1.00 - 1.49); HR(GG) = 1.47 (95% C.I. 1.20
- 1.80). In contrast, no heterogeneity between genotypes
can be observed in the untreated group. The conclusion of
the interaction analysis did not change when radiotherapy,
surgery, and adjuvant endocrine therapy were added as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

additional covariates in the model (p(interaction) = 0.0035, N =
8943 [1110 events]). Despite its association with survival
in the anthracycline-treated and any chemotherapy treated
subsets, no evidence of interaction was observed for the
rs11155012 SNP (Supplementary Table 3), suggesting
that its possible association with survival is not entirely
treatment-specific.

eQTL analysis of SNPs in the survival-associated
loci
To determine if rs6500483 or rs11155012, or other
SNPs in the surrounding LD regions (r2 > 0.1), associate
with gene expression in breast cancer, two publicly
available data sets (containing both genotype and gene
expression data) were used for expression quantitative
loci (eQTL) analysis: TCGA [12], and METABRIC [13].
We classified eQTLs as cis if they occurred within ±1 Mb
from any SNP in the LD region; any eQTLs outside these
regions were classified as trans.
The SNP rs6500843 is located in chromosome
16, in an intron of the RBFOX1 gene, which is the

a biologically significant role for the haplotype(s) tagged
by these two SNPs.
The LD region around rs11155012 contains two
genes: CCDC28A and ECT2L. In total, 34 genes are
located in the expanded cis-eQTL region around this
locus. One nominally significant cis-eQTL was observed
in this region, and occurred as a positive correlation
between the rare allele of rs9321678 (r2 = 0.147, D’ = 1
with rs11155012) and the neighboring CCDC28A gene
(t = 2.003, p = 0.0454). In the trans-eQTL analysis, the
rs11155012 locus was associated with the expression of
the genes CHRFAM7A, CRYBB2, RASGRP4, MOCS1,
SOX21, and UPK3B. No statistically significant GO term
enrichment was detected for the rs11155012 locus.
The complete trans-eQTL results for both loci are
presented in detail in Supplementary Table 4.

only gene in the immediate LD region surrounding
the SNP. The expanded cis-eQTL region (±1 Mb)
surrounding the SNP also contains the RNA coding
genes MIR8065, LINC01570, and LOC102723308, as
well as the uncharacterized gene LOC440337. No ciseQTLs were observed in the rs6500843 locus. When
we examined trans-eQTLs, the expression levels of six
genes were associated with genotypes in the rs6500843
locus; MCM3, CENPM, PKMYT1, AURKA, KIFC1,
TK1 (Bonferroni-corrected for all genes on the array; p
< 0.05). In an enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology
biological processes, using an arbitrary raw eQTL p-value
threshold of p < 10-5 to select an expanded candidate gene
list, GO terms involved in cell cycle control, mitosis and
DNA replication emerged as highly significant for the
trans-eQTLs (34 probes representing 28 genes) in the
rs6500843 locus (Table 3). Note that rs6500843 itself was
not present in the data set, nor were any SNPs in complete
LD with it. The vast majority of eQTLs in this region are
associated with the SNPs rs6500842 (r2 0.54, D’ 0.87 with
rs6500843) and rs7205424 (r2 0.26, D’ 0.53), suggesting

Expression based survival analysis of the genes
associated with the rs6500483 and rs11155012 loci

consistent with the results of the cis-eQTL analysis: the
rare allele of rs9321678 was associated with increased
CCDC28A expression, which in turn is associated with
better prognosis. The rare alleles of rs11155012 and
rs9321678 segregate in different haplotypes (negative
correlation), as can be deduced from the LD information
(r2 = 0.147, D’ = 1, MAFs are roughly equal [0.20 and 0.18,
respectively]). Consequently, the rare allele of rs11155012
would be expected to associate with worse prognosis,
which is indeed the case in our SNP survival analysis.
Of the trans-eQTL genes associated with the rs11155012
locus, the genes CHRFAM7A, CRYBB2, MOCS1 and
SOX21 were associated with survival among all cases in
the KM-Plotter analysis, whereas only one (SOX21) was
associated with survival among chemotherapy-treated
cases (Supplementary Table 5). Significant heterogeneity
(p = 0.0044; 0.0239 after BH-adjustment for multiple
testing) was observed for SOX21: high SOX21 associated
with better prognosis among untreated cases (HR 0.82,
95% C.I. 0.69 – 0.98), but the effect was reversed among

Next, we utilized the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database
[14] to investigate whether any of the genes surrounding
our statistically significant SNPs are associated with breast
cancer survival (10 year relapse-free survival) at the gene
expression level. Regions of interest were defined as
regions containing SNPs with r2> 0.2 to the nominal SNP.
The region for rs11155012 contained two genes (ECT2L,
CCDC28A), and the region for rs6500483 contained
one (RBFOX1/A2BP1). These candidate genes were
analyzed in the “any adjuvant chemotherapy” category,
as information on specific types of chemotherapy was not
available in the database. Among these cases (N = 425),
high expression of the gene CCDC28A was associated
with better prognosis (p = 0.00012, HR 0.5, 95% C.I. 0.35
- 0.72) (Supplementary Figure 1). It was also associated
with prognosis in the full data set, irrespective of treatment
(N = 3455, p = 0, HR 0.56, 95% C.I. 0.49 - 0.63). This is

chemotherapy-treated cases (HR 1.45, 95% C.I. 1.02 –
2.06).
Expression of the RBFOX1 gene at the rs6500483
locus did not associate with survival in the KM-plotter
database, either among chemotherapy-treated cases or
among all cases. In contrast, all six trans-eQTL genes
associated with the rs6500843 locus (MCM3, CENPM,
PKMYT1, AURKA, KIFC1, TK1) were associated with
survival when analyzing all cases irrespective of treatment,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as well as among cases who specifically had not received
systemic chemotherapy. All other genes but AURKA
associated also with survival among cases treated with
adjuvant chemotherapy (Supplementary Table 5) which
would suggest a treatment-independent effect for most
of these genes. However, a test of heterogeneity between
the treated and non-treated groups indicated a statistically
significant difference in AURKA-associated survival
between treated and non-treated cases (heterogeneity

high AURKA expression associated with poor survival in
untreated cases, no such effect was seen in chemotherapytreated cases.
Next, we investigated the possible connection
between the rs6500843 locus and the trans-eQTL genes.
Rs6500843 is located in an intron of RBFOX1, a tissuespecific splicing regulator, for which target genes have
been previously published [15]. Given that the genetic
neighborhood around rs6500843 contains no other protein
coding genes, and little is known about the three RNA
coding genes in the region, we operated here under the
hypothesis that the SNP is functionally associated with the
RBFOX1 gene. As splice variants of gene products may
give rise to different signals in microarray experiments,
we cross-referenced the published list of RBFOX1
targets against our expanded list of putative trans-eQTL
genes (raw p < 10-5 in the eQTL analysis) that also fall
within the enriched GO:0007049 (cell cycle) Gene
Ontology group (Table 3), and came up with one gene:

the transcription factor FOXM1. Genome-wide target
genes for FOXM1 have also been previously published
[16]; comparison of the statistically significant sites
(combined genomic binding and coexpression) with our
trans-eQTL list yielded four genes regulated by FOXM1:
EXO1, MCM6, UHRF1, and KPNA2. These connections
between the genomic locus and the eQTL genes have been
schematically summarized in Figure 3.

The rs11155012 locus contains a genomic
regulatory region
Finally, we investigated the possibility that the
prognostic SNPs identified in this study are in linkage
disequilibrium with other, functionally significant
variants in their genomic vicinity. All SNPs in linkage
disequilibrium (r2> 0.2) with rs6500843 and rs11155012
were analyzed using HaploReg, a database of genomic
regulatory elements [17]. Rs11155012 is in high LD
with a number of SNPs affecting a genomic enhancer

epithelial cells (HMEC). The site has been experimentally
shown to bind the proteins FOXA1 and FOXA2, and
a Foxa binding motif is predicted to be altered by
rs6570291, a SNP in near-complete LD with rs11155012
(r2 = 0.99).
Equally strong evidence of an active regulatory site

any chemotherapy, and rs11155012 among cases treated
with anthracyclines. Of these, rs6500843 was found to
interact with adjuvant chemotherapy in a subsequent
multivariate interaction analysis, reinforcing the notion
that its association with survival may have a predictive
basis: carriers of the rs6500843 G-allele appear to have
somewhat worse survival than other chemotherapy-treated
cases.
The only gene in the LD region surrounding
rs6500843 is RBFOX1 (A2BP1), which encodes a highly
conserved RNA-binding protein involved in the control of
tissue-specific mRNA splicing [18]. It has been identified
as a common target of LOH and copy number variation in
other types of malignancies [19-21], and a SNP in the gene
(not in LD with rs6500843) has been reported to associate
with survival in non-small-cell lung cancer [22], but little is
known about its role in breast cancer. While the rs6500843
SNP is predicted to alter a homeobox transcription factor
binding site targeted by 33 transcription factors, we did
not find further experimentally verified evidence of a
genetically modulated regulatory region in this locus, nor
was RBFOX1 gene expression itself associated with breast
cancer survival. However, a trans-eQTL analysis of the

DISCUSSION
We have utilized three independent data sets
to evaluate the significance of putative prognostic/
predictive SNPs from an initial GWS pilot investigating
survival after adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.
This analysis was carried out as a meta-analysis between
iCOGS studies and two additional data sets (SUCCESS-A,
POSH). Two loci emerged as statistically significant in the
two-stage analysis: rs6500843 among cases treated with

SNPs in the rs6500843 region identified six statistically
significant genes, all of which were associated with
survival in breast cancer in the Kaplan-Meier Plotter
analysis (and five in the chemotherapy-only subgroup).
Notably, the Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) associated with
differential survival when comparing chemoterapy-treated
and non-treated cases. High AURKA expression appeared
to associate with poor survival in untreated cases, whereas
no such effect was seen in chemotherapy-treated cases,
which suggests a favorable response to the chemotherapy
regimens administered to these cases. AURKA has been
previously suggested to be a master regulator of cellular
radio- and chemoresistance, proliferation, cell cycle
progression and anchorage-independent growth [23].
In order to detect enriched Gene Ontology
biological processes among the eQTL genes, we relaxed
the criteria of statistical significance and analyzed a
slightly larger list of candidate genes (n = 28). This set
of candidates was strongly enriched for genes involved
in cell cycle control (GO: 0007049; cell cycle): 15
out of 28 genes fell within this category, an 11-fold
enrichment compared to a random selection of genes.
The set of genes includes EXO1, knockdown of which
has been reported to desensitize H196 lung cancer cells
to paclitaxel treatment [24]; KIFC1, reported to modulate
docetaxel sensitivity [25]; the breast cancer susceptibility
gene CHEK2 [26, 27]; the Bloom syndrome gene BLM
[28]; and the Survivin gene BIRC5, reported to associate
with chemo- and radioresistance in breast cancer [29]. It
is intriguing to see this group of cell cycle control and
chemoresistance-associated genes emerge in eQTL with
a SNP associated with survival after chemotherapy,
especially as there is a plausible connection between the
rs6500843 locus and this set of trans-eQTL genes (Figure
3). Rs6500843 is located in an intron of RBFOX1, a
tissue-specific splicing regulator that targets the protooncogene FOXM1, a transcription factor involved in cell
cycle control. In our analyses, FOXM1 itself emerged as a
putative trans-eQTL gene associated with the rs6500843
locus, and it has been reported to regulate four other
genes on that list: EXO1, MCM6, UHRF1, and KPNA2.
Of these, EXO1 is of particular interest, as the FOXM1EXO1 regulatory connection has been previously reported
to modulate chemoresistance in ovarian carcinoma cells
[30]. An important caveat to this analysis is that the SNP
rs6500843 itself was not present in the eQTL data set,
and the eQTL results are based on SNPs in incomplete
linkage disequilibrium with it. The functional significance
of rs6500843 itself, and the putative transcription factor
binding site it resides in, therefore remains unclear.
The other SNP emerging as statistically significant
in the validation analysis, rs11155012, is located in a LD
region that contains two genes, CCDC28A and ECT2L, the
biological functions of which are poorly understood. Our
analysis of publicly available gene expression data [12]
indicates that CCDC28A transcript abundance is associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with relapse-free survival in breast cancer, which suggests
that rs11155012 may be linked to a prognostically
significant functional variant in this gene. Indeed,
rs11155012 is in LD with a number of SNPs affecting
a genomic enhancer site active in human mammary
epithelial cells. The site has been experimentally shown to
bind the proteins FOXA1 and FOXA2, and a Foxa binding
motif is predicted to be altered by rs6570291, a SNP in
near-complete LD with rs11155012 (r2 = 0.99). FOXA1
(Hnf-3-alpha) is a key transcription factor involved in
mechanisms known to be critical in breast carcinogenesis:
estrogen receptor -mediated signaling, and cell cycle
control in conjunction with BRCA1 [31, 32]. Furthermore,
a modest cis-eQTL effect was observed between
rs9321678 (r2 = 0.147, D’ = 1 with rs11155012) and the
CCDC28A gene. We also detected a trans-eQTL between
rs9495127 (r2 = 0.129, D’ = 1) and the transcription
factor SOX21, a gene whose expression associates with
increasing hazard among chemotherapy-treated cases
despite being protective in untreated cases. While causality
cannot be established without experimental work, these
findings provide supporting evidence for an association
between genetic variation in this regulatory site and breast
cancer survival. The predictive value of this genetic locus
remains questionable, however, as we did not observe
an interaction between rs11155012 and treatment in the
clinical data.
The hazard ratios for rs6500483 show some
heterogeneity between the data sets used in this study:
SUCCESS-A appears to disagree with the other data sets.
Rs6500483 is represented in SUCCESS-A by rs4786939,
but these two SNPs are in nearly complete linkage
disequilibrium (r2 0.967, D’ 1.0), indicating that the use of
a tagging SNP is an unlikely source of heterogeneity here.
Heterogeneity between follow-up times and treatment
regimens would be a more likely reason: the cases in
SUCCESS-A have all received taxane-based therapy,
a regimen poorly represented in the other data sets.
Unfortunately, the specific chemotherapy agents involved
in the genetic association cannot be resolved using our
currently available data. Additionally, in light of our use
of GWAS as a starting point, it must be noted that our
findings do not reach genome-wide significance. However,
the purpose of the initial Stage I GWAS was to define a
candidate SNP set that would most likely capture any true
survival-associated SNPs, the statistical significance of
which would then be evaluated in the substantially more
powerful Stage II analysis. We do not anticipate very
large effect sizes in SNP-based survival analyses, and
therefore utilized a stepwise study design to alleviate the
problem of multiple testing and resultant loss of statistical
power. Only 39 SNPs were analyzed in Stage II, two of
which meet our criteria of statistical significance. Both
findings are supported by additional lines of evidence
from gene expression- and regulome-based analyses.
Nevertheless, these results must be viewed as exploratory
7400

Oncotarget

and hypothesis-generating in nature.
In conclusion, we have conducted a two-stage
genetic association study to detect SNPs associated with
survival after chemotherapy. One SNP, rs6500843, was
found to interact specifically with adjuvant chemotherapy,
independently of standard prognostic markers, whereas
rs11155012 may associate with survival in general.
eQTL analysis of the rs6500843 locus identified a group
of genes known to associate with cancer progression,
chemoresistance, and survival. We propose that these
genes may be connected to the rs6500843 locus via a
RBFOX1-FOXM1 -mediated regulatory pathway. If
confirmed, these findings may aid in the development of
better predictive markers and improved individualized
cancer therapy.

death was obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry, a
central database of diagnostic and death information on all
cancer patients in Finland.
The HEBCS-GWS series (“Stage I”) was genotyped
using the Illumina 550K platform as previously described
[36]. The preliminary survival analysis was carried out
using three different endpoints in parallel: five-year
BDDM (breast cancer death or distant metastasis), 10year breast cancer specific survival, and 10-year overall
survival, using a codominant genetic model (test for
heterogeneity between genotypes). Since survival after
chemotherapy was the main focus of this study, it would
have been ideal to entirely restrict the initial Stage I
analysis only to chemotherapy-treated cases (comprising
45% of the data set; Table 4), given sufficient statistical
power. To determine the feasibility of this approach,
the R package ‘survSNP’ was employed to estimate the
statistical power of our survival analysis [37]. Using a
significance threshold of p < 10-5 and a hypothetical SNP
with a minor allele frequency of 0.25 as the ad hoc target
for discovery, we had 80% power to detect a per-allele HR
of 1.6 in the whole sample set, but only 32% power if the
analysis was restricted to chemotherapy-treated cases only.
Analysis of specific chemotherapy regimens would have
decreased the statistical power further. Based on this, we
concluded that a treatment-based subgroup analysis alone
would be unacceptably underpowered. Therefore, to be
eligible for subsequent validation, SNPs had to meet one
of these three more inclusive criteria: 1) main effect p <
10-4 and p < 0.01 among chemotherapy-treated cases, 2) p
< 10-4 among chemotherapy-treated cases, or 3) p < 10-3
among chemotherapy-treated cases and a homozygoteassociated hazard ratio > 3.0. These SNPs (n = 45) were
then selected as candidates for Stage II validation and
genotyping as part of the iCOGS project [2].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Initially, a genome-wide study (Stage I: HEBCSGWS) was conducted to discover candidate SNPs that
may be associated with breast cancer survival, with an
emphasis on treatment-based subgroups. This candidate
SNP set was then analyzed in three validation datasets
(Stage II: iCOGS, SUCCESS-A, POSH). SNPs emerging
as statistically significant within Stage II were further
examined in an eQTL analysis of two breast cancer
data sets (TCGA, METABRIC), supported by in silico
genomic feature analysis. The data sets used in this study
are described below, and summarized in Table 4. Informed
consent has been obtained from all patients included in
this study.

Discovery GWS (Stage I: HEBCS-GWS)

Validation studies (Stage II: iCOGS, POSH,
SUCCESS-A)

Genotype information was obtained from a study
series consisting of 805 Finnish breast cancer cases
(HEBCS-GWS). All cases were female, ascertained for
their first primary invasive breast cancer. Of these, 423
cases originated from a prospective patient series of
consecutive unselected, incident breast cancer patients
treated in the Helsinki University Hospital Department
of Oncology in years 1997–1998 and 2000 [33, 34]. The
series also includes 140 cases recruited between 2001 and
2004, and 242 additional familial cases [7, 35]. To increase
the statistical power of survival analyses, the GWS series
was specifically enriched for cases with reduced survival
(distant metastasis or death at the time of the initiation
of the study in 2008): in total, the series includes 312
breast cancer specific events, and 339 any-cause mortality
events at the time of analysis. The cancer diagnoses
were confirmed through the Finnish Cancer Registry and
hospital records. Information on the date and cause of

The candidate SNPs from Stage I were analyzed in
three additional data sets: iCOGS, POSH, SUCCESS-A
(described in detail below).

iCOGS
SNPs identified as putatively significant in Stage
I HEBCS GWAS analysis of chemotherapy-treated
cases were included on a custom Illumina Infinium
array (iCOGS) for large scale genotyping of a data set
of 50927 individuals from 52 Breast Cancer Association
Consortium (BCAC) member studies, 41 of which were
of predominantly European ancestry, 9 of Asian, and 2
of African-American ancestry. Genotyping and quality
control was carried out as previously described [2].
Studies represented on the iCOGS chip were
7401

Oncotarget

included in survival analysis here if sufficient followup data was available, with a minimum requirement of
at least 10 survival events (deaths from any cause) per
study. Additionally, we included only studies with cases
from predominantly European ancestry, and from which
adjuvant chemotherapy information was available. At the
individual level, we included only female cases ascertained
for their first primary, invasive tumor. After these filtering
steps, the data set consisted of 17828 eligible cases (2198
any-cause deaths; 12%), of which 6720 cases were treated
with any adjuvant chemotherapy. Of these, 3010 cases
were known to have been treated with anthracyclinebased chemotherapy. While data on taxane (n = 868)
and methotrexate-based (n = 1022) adjuvant treatment
was also available, these treatments were not analyzed
as separate subgroups due to the small sample sizes and
poor comparability with the other data sets (Table 4). For
2528 cases, the specific type of chemotherapy regimen
was unknown. The cases included here come from 16
separate BCAC studies, which have been described in
Supplementary Table 7.

and Phenotypes (dbGaP Study Accession: phs000547.
v1.p) [40].

Statistical analysis
In stage II, unless otherwise noted, 10-year overall
survival (death from any cause) was used as the end point
in all survival analyses, as all-cause mortality data was the
most widely available in the iCOGS data set. This also
allowed us to avoid the potential biases that can arise from
clinical follow-up data in multicenter studies [41].
All survival analyses were run under the additive
genetic model, follow-up times left-truncated, and
adjusted for patient age at diagnosis, and (in the case of
iCOGS) stratified by study in order to minimize potential
biases arising from differing case recruitment strategies
and different populations of origin. The analyses were
performed within the same subgroups (chemotherapytreated cases and anthracycline-specific analysis) as in
stage I.
To alleviate potential biases arising from population
stratification, e.g. cryptic relatedness of cases, the analysis
was also adjusted for three genetic principal components
to correct for possible population substructure. The
principal components were calculated from the genotypes
of uncorrelated (r2 < 0.2) SNPs in the genome-wide
data sets. Briefly, for the HEBCS-GWS, POSH and
SUCCESS-A data sets, we pruned a subset of SNPs not
in substantial LD with any other SNPs (r2< 0.2) and ran a
principal component analysis (PCA) using the ‘GenABEL’
package in R. The PCA analysis for iCOGS has been
described previously [2]; as with the other three data sets,
only three principal components were used in this study.
The selected SNPs from the HEBCS-GWS data
set (Stage I) were also re-analyzed at this point using the
same parameters as with the validation data. This means
that Stage I results were here re-analyzed only under the
additive model (which can be expected to capture both
dominant and recessive signals), regardless of the original
selection criteria, reducing the amount of multiple testing
in the final meta-analysis stage. While the original SNP
selection was based on more inclusive criteria, the
purpose of this was to ensure that the final results are
directly comparable across the stages of the study. Thus,
allele calling and quality control for HEBCS-GWS was
performed as previously described [39], and the survival
analysis was performed as described above. Similar to the
validation data sets, principal component analysis (PCA)
was included for HEBCS-GWS as well at this stage.
Results of the Stage II (iCOGS, POSH,
SUCCESS-A) survival analysis were meta-analyzed
under a fixed-effects model using the ‘rmeta’ package in
R, and the resulting meta-statistics were used to determine
statistical significance. Benjamini-Hochberg correction
was applied to account for multiple testing [42].

POSH GWS
The POSH GWS consisted of 536 individuals (236
any-cause deaths; 44%) selected from a consecutively
ascertained cohort of early onset cases (diagnosed with
invasive breast cancer at the age of 40 or earlier) from
the United Kingdom. These cases were enrolled into
the Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus
Hereditary breast cancer (POSH) between 2000 and 2008,
as previously described [38]. The POSH GWS material
was enriched for cases with poor prognosis by including
cases with triple-negative breast cancer (n=401), and
cases with particularly short duration of breast cancer
survival (<2 years, n=48); additional cases with relatively
long survival were then included for contrast (>4 years,
n=125) [39]. These cases were genotyped on the Illumina
660-Quad SNP array; genotyping and quality control was
carried out as previously described [39]. 518 cases (97%)
in this data set were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.

SUCCESS-A
SUCCESS-A is a randomized Phase III study of
response to treatment of early primary breast cancer with
adjuvant therapy after surgical resection. The cases are
all treated with anthracycline- and taxane-based adjuvant
chemotherapy, and randomized for Gemcitabine treatment.
The sample set consisted of 3596 cases (207 any-cause
deaths; 6%) that were recruited between 2005 and 2007
from 250 study sites across Germany. Genotyping was
carried out using the Illumina Human OmniExpressFFPE BeadChip platform. The SUCCESS-A data as well

Statistically significant SNPs in treatment-based
subgroups were further tested for interaction with
treatment in the iCOGS data set, as it contains both treated
and non-treated cases in abundant numbers, enabling
robust interaction testing. This analysis was adjusted
for clinically relevant covariates (grade, ER, tumor
size category [T], nodal status [N], age at diagnosis).
Distant metastasis at diagnosis (M) was not included
as a covariate, as this information was missing for the
majority of cases. To avoid biases introduced by mostly
missing data, cases known to be M1 were not specifically
excluded from the analysis either. Two Cox proportional
hazards models were generated, one with the SNP and
treatment status as independent covariates, and one that
also included an interaction term between genotype and
treatment. The statistical significance of an interaction
was then determined using a likelihood-ratio test between
the two models. To rule out confounding effects caused
by other treatment types, we also conducted a secondary
interaction analysis where radiotherapy (yes/no), surgery
(yes/no), and adjuvant endocrine therapy (yes/no) were
added as additional covariates in the model.
We employed chi-square tests of heterogeneity
to test for association between SNP genotypes and the
following clinicopathological characteristics: estrogen
receptor status (ER; positive or negative), histological
grade (1 – 3), tumor size (T; 1 – 4), and lymph node
metastasis (N; positive or negative) in the iCOGS data set.

and METABRIC data sets were analyzed separately and
then meta-analyzed to detect the most consistent results.
We searched for cis-eQTLs within regions defined as ±1
Mb from any SNP in the LD region; no formal multiple
testing correction was applied to eQTL results within these
regions. Any genes outside these regions were analyzed
for trans-eQTL and subjected to transcriptome-wide
multiple testing correction (Bonferroni).
In addition to looking for individual genes that are
statistically significant in the eQTL analysis, we also ran a
pathway-enrichment analysis on a set of candidate genes
selected using a more lenient p-value threshold from the
eQTL analysis (raw p < 10-5). The analysis was restricted
to Gene Ontology Biological Processes and was performed
using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool [44, 45].

Further in silico evaluation of SNPs and candidate
genes
It is likely that the prognostic SNPs identified in this
study are merely linkage disequilibrium proxies for other,
functionally significant variants in their genomic vicinity.
In an effort to identify the SNPs and genes with a direct
functional impact on breast cancer survival, we utilized a
number of public databases. For these analyses, regions
of interest were defined as regions containing SNPs in
linkage disequilibrium with the survival-associated SNPs
at r2> 0.1. Candidate genes in the regions surrounding the
prognostic SNPs, as well as statistically significant transeQTL genes associated with the survival-associated loci,
were analyzed in the Kaplan-Meier plotter (http://kmplot.
com/analysis/), a gene expression and survival database
currently consisting of 4142 breast cancer cases, of which
425 were known to have been treated with adjuvant
chemotherapy [12]. These analyses were performed using
10-year relapse-free survival, as this was the only end
point available for the majority of cases in the KaplanMeier plotter data set, and optimized break points for
the binarization of gene expression levels. All SNPs
in these regions were further analyzed for their impact
on regulatory features using HaploReg, a database of
genomic functional annotations [15].

eQTL analysis
To determine if the survival-associated SNPs or
other SNPs in the LD region (r2 > 0.1) associate with
gene expression in breast cancer, two publicly available
data sets (containing both genotype and gene expression
data) were used for eQTL analysis: TCGA [12], and
METABRIC [13]. The TCGA gene expression data is
mRNA sequencing data from the Illumina HiSeq 2000
platform, whereas the METABRIC gene expression data
was generated by the Illumina Human WG6 v3 platform.
Tumor tissue genotyping had been carried out using the
Affymetrix Genome Wide Human SNP array 6.0 for
both data sets. Of the two validated SNPs, rs11155012
itself was represented on this SNP array, whereas
rs6500843 was not. The latter was best represented by
the linked SNPs rs4786121 and rs7190693 (r2 0.603, D’
1.0 for both SNPs); note that all SNPs in the LD region
with r2 > 0.2 were nevertheless included in the eQTL
analysis. The TCGA breast cancer data set consists of
913 solid breast tumor samples that also had genotype
data available. METABRIC consists of 1328 solid breast
tumor samples with both genotype and gene expression
data. eQTL analysis was carried out by calculating linear
models between genotype and gene expression using the
R package ‘MatrixEQTL’ [43]. Only genes present in
both data sets were included in the analysis: the TCGA
