SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Missense mutations in p53 generate aberrant proteins with abrogated tumor suppressor functions
that can also acquire oncogenic gain-of-functions (GOF) that promote malignant progression,
invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance1–5. Mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins undergo massive
constitutive stabilization specifically in tumors, which is the key requisite for GOF6–8. Although
currently 11 million patients worldwide live with tumors expressing highly stabilized mutp53, it is
unknown whether mutp53 is a therapeutic target in vivo.
Here we use a novel mutp53 mouse model expressing an inactivatible R248Q hotspot mutation
(floxQ) to show that tumors depend on sustained mutp53 expression. Upon Tamoxifen-induced
mutp53 ablation, allo-transplanted and autochthonous tumors curb their growth, thus extending
animal survival by 37%, and advanced tumors undergo apoptosis and tumor regression or
stagnation.

The HSP90/HDAC6 chaperone machinery, which is significantly upregulated in cancer compared
to normal tissues, is a major determinant of mutp53 stabilization9–12. We show that long-term
HSP90 inhibition significantly extends the survival of mutp53 Q/−2 and H/H (R172H allele3) mice
by 59% and 48%, respectively, but not their respective p53−/− littermates. This mutp53-dependent
drug effect occurs in H/H mice treated with 17DMAG+SAHA and in H/H and Q/− mice treated
with the potent Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib. Notably, drug activity correlates with induction of

mutp53 degradation, tumor apoptosis and prevention of T-lymphomagenesis. These proof-ofprinciple data identify mutp53 as an actionable cancer-specific drug target.
Tumor-promoting GOF activities of missense mutp53 alleles are demonstrated by knockin
(KI) mouse models1–5 and in Li-Fraumeni (LFS) patients carrying germline TP53 missense
mutations. LFS patients with TP53 missense mutations have earlier cancer onset than
patients with loss of p53 expression13,14. Strikingly, p53R248Q/+ LFS patients have higher
tumor numbers and shorter tumor-free survival by 10.5 yrs than p53null/+ patients2. A key
feature and prerequisite for GOF is that mutp53 proteins undergo massive stabilization
specifically in tumors6–8.

RNAi-mediated depletion of mutp53 produces marked cytotoxic effects in human cancer
cells in culture and xenograft models15. Notably, mutp53 knockdown in orthotopic
allografts of KrasG12D pancreatic murine cancer cells dramatically reduced their metastatic
ability16. Together, this provides a strong rationale for testing mutp53-destabilizing cancer
therapy in vivo. If confirmed, it might establish mutp53 as an important direct drug target in
many cancer patients. To rigorously validate this, we generated conditional inactivatable
p53 R248Q (floxQ) mice (Extended Fig. 1a–c) with a Rosa26CreERT2 (ERT2) knockin
allele, which mirror the constitutive Q mice2 in tumor spectrum and survival (Extended Fig.
1d). Tamoxifen/4OHT treatment activates CreERT2, causing deletion of the floxQ allele
(with up to 90% efficiency) and cell death in primary T-lymphoma cultures, but not in
various controls (Fig. 1a, Extended Fig. 1e). Likewise, transplantation assays into
immunocompromised hosts (subcutaneous and tail vein allografts, prophylactic and
therapeutic treatments) showed that floxQ deletion markedly inhibited tumor growth in vivo
(Fig. 1a–d, Extended Fig. 1f–h) and prolonged survival of recipients compared to controls
(Fig. 1b, Extended Fig. 1f). These data strongly suggest tumor dependence on sustained high
levels of mutp53.

Author Manuscript

Importantly, clinically advanced autochthonous tumors in floxQ/− mice responded to
mutp53 ablation with regression or stagnation (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Fig. 2a).
Mechanistically, this was due to marked tumor apoptosis (Fig. 2d), but not cell cycle arrest
(Extended Fig. 2b). Notably, mutp53 ablation was also associated with strong suppression of
lung metastasis, contrasting with large metastatic nodules in controls (Fig. 2e). Moreover,
mutp53 ablation in floxQ/− mice with early disease (10 wks old) (Fig. 2f) extended median
overall and T-lymphoma-specific survival by 37% from 128 to 175 days (Fig. 2g, Extended
Fig. 2c). Notably, the improved overall survival of floxQ/− mice, which normally have a
significantly shorter lifespan than p53-null littermates2 (Extended Fig. 1d), now resembled
that of p53-null mice (Extended Fig. 2d), while their T-lymphoma specific survival now
extended beyond that of p53-null mice (Extended Fig. 2e). This further indicates that tumors
driven by mutp53 depend on stabilized mutp53. In support, at endpoint (death), most tumors
of all types (17/23, 74%) from floxQ/− mice that were Tamoxifen-treated at 10 wks were
again composed of 100% mutp53-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2h, Extended Fig. 2f). This
indicates strong selective pressure for the small minority of non-recombined mutp53positive cells outcompeting the majority of recombined cells. It is tempting to speculate that
complete allele removal would have further improved survival. Thus, these data establish for

the first time that continued expression of stabilized mutp53 is essential for tumor
maintenance in vivo.

The HSP90 chaperone machinery is highly activated in cancers compared to normal tissues
and renders them resistant to proteotoxic stress by supporting proper folding of
conformationally aberrant oncoproteins including mutp5317,18. Thus, cancer cells have a far
smaller tolerance for HSP90 inhibition. We and others previously showed that HSP90 and
its obligatory positive regulator, cytosolic HDAC6, are major determinants of mutp53
stabilization9–12. Importantly, deletion of HSF1, the master transcriptional activator of the
inducible heat shock response including HSP90, dramatically suppresses oncogenicity in
mutp53 H/+ mice, but has no effect in p53-null mice19,20. These data clearly indicate that
tumorigenicity of the H allele - but not of p53-null - strongly depends on Hsf1-mediated
chaperone support, mainly HSP90. 17AAG and its hydrophilic derivative 17DMAG are
ansamycin-derived highly specific first generation Hsp90 inhibitors (Hsp90i)17. Likewise,
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including FDA-approved SAHA, are promising
anti-cancer drugs whose actions involve hyperacetylation of histone and select non-histone
targets including HDAC6 substrate Hsp90, thus indirectly inhibiting Hsp9021.

Author Manuscript

The cytotoxicity of 17AAG/SAHA in mutp53 cancer cells, despite being pleiotropic drugs,
is largely due to the destabilization of mutp53 protein via Hsp90/HDAC6 inhibition11,12.
Moreover, due to complementary drug targets 17AAG/SAHA treatment caused synergistic
cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cells compared to monotherapy11. Likewise, 17AAG
and SAHA synergized in T47D (p53L194F) xenografts in vivo (Extended Fig. 3). SAHA or
17AAG alone were effective in blocking tumor growth of parental MDA231 (p53R280K)
cells, but lost their efficacy when excess ectopic mutp53 was present. Only the combination
of both drugs overcame this block (Fig. 3a). To translate the genetic proof-of-principle
results from floxQ/− mice (Figs. 1, 2) towards clinical application, we performed long-term
treatments with 17DMAG+SAHA in mutp53R172H (H) mice3. Starting at 8 wks when most
H/H mice exhibited early intrathymic T-lymphoma (Fig. 3b), H/H and p53-null mice were
treated life-long with 17DMAG+SAHA vs vehicles. Strikingly, HSP90 inhibition benefited
only H/H but not p53-null mice, extending their overall survival from a median 140 to 182
days (p<0.001, Fig. 3c). Moreover, drug treatment improved survival of H/H mice beyond
that of p53-null mice (Fig. 3d). For T-lymphoma-specific survival, again only H/H but not
p53-null controls benefited from 17DMAG+SAHA treatment (p<0.001, Fig. 3e). These data
strongly support that tumors expressing mutp53 depend on its presence and fundamentally
differ in their oncogenic wiring from p53-null tumors. Moreover, the mechanism of action
of these pleiotropic HSP90 inhibitors is mutp53-dependent.

Analysis of vehicle- and drug-treated thymic tissues at death for evidence of drug activity
showed HSP90i activity (marked by transient induction of HSF1 target Hsp7022), but this
did not significantly prevent tumors in p53-null mice (Fig. 3f). In contrast, in H/H mice,
when the drug worked (Hsp70 induced, mutp53 undetectable) it apparently prevented Tlymphoma formation in every case since we found only normal thymic tissues (Fig. 3f,
‘p53H/H normal thymus’ mice #7–14, plus 12 mice analyzed by autopsy). In contrast, in all
6 T-lymphomas that arose despite drug treatment, the drugs failed to inhibit HSP90 (Hsp70
not induced) (Fig. 3f, 6/26 (23%) escapers). Mechanistically, NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone

oxido-reductase) is required to activate 17DMAG by metabolizing its quinone moiety, and
NQO1 downregulation is a predictive biomarker for resistance to this ansamycin class of
Hsp90i23,24. Indeed, we observed reduced NQO1 expression in escaper versus responder Tlymphomas (Fig. 3g). In sum, HSP90 inhibition prevented the development of T-lymphomas
in mutp53 mice.

To reduce complexity and dosing of the combinatorial anti-HSP90 treatment, we eliminated
HDAC inhibition and replaced 17DMAG with the highly potent synthetic Hsp90i
ganetespib. Ganetespib has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in more than 1200 cancer
patients treated to date, and is currently being evaluated in 11 clinical trials including a
Phase 3 lung cancer trial (www.syntapharma.com)25,26. On a molar basis, ganetespib is >50fold more potent than 17AAG in degrading mutp53 and killing mutp53 cancer cells
(Extended Fig. 4a–c). Moreover, ganetespib destabilized mutp53 but not wildtype p53 in
human tumor cells and xenografts (Extended Fig. 4d–f). Ganetespib also induced
significantly more apoptosis in Q/− vs p53-null T-lymphoma cells (Extended Fig. 4g, h).
Likewise, ganetespib strongly suppressed tumor growth in allografts of Q/− T- and Blymphomas treated with prophylactic and therapeutic protocols (Fig. 4a, b, Extended Fig. 4i,
j). Notably, this in vivo drug effect, marked by Hsp70 induction, correlated perfectly with
mutp53 destabilization and induction of apoptosis within 24h upon repeated dosing (Fig. 4c,
d). Moreover, ganetespib synergized with conventional chemotherapy like
cyclophosphamide (Fig. 4e, Extended Fig. 4k).

Encouraged by these data, we performed long-term treatments of early disease (8 wks) H/H
and Q/− (Fig. 2f, 3b) vs their respective p53−/− controls (note, they differ in genetic
background2,3,27,28) with one weekly dose of ganetespib (50 mg/kg) or vehicle lifelong.
Strikingly, ganetespib benefited only mutp53 mice, representing a structural mutant (H
allele) and a DNA-contact mutant (Q allele), but not p53-null mice, extending median
overall survival of H/H mice from 157 to 233 days (48%, Fig. 4f) and Q/− mice from 146 to
232 days (59%, Fig. 4g). Q/− T-lymphoma-specific survival was also greatly extended (Fig.
4h). Importantly, clinically advanced autochthonous tumors in Q/− mice responded to
ganetespib with regression or stagnation (Fig. 4i). H/H mice, whose lifespan is normally
identical to p53-null mice7, responded to ganetespib with improved survival beyond p53null controls (Fig. 4j), whereas Q/− mice, whose lifespan is significantly shorter than p53nulls2 (Extended Fig. 1d), showed improved survival now resembling p53-nulls (Extended
Fig. 4l). The fact that ganetespib and genetic mutp53 removal (Extended Fig. 2d) both cause
floxQ/− survival to overlap with p53-null mice supports that ganetespib targets mutp53.
However, ganetespib improved survival more efficiently than genetic mutp53 ablation
(Extended Fig. 4m), likely due to persistent destabilization of mutp53 as compared to
incomplete genetic ablation at 10 wks. Other tumor-promoting Hsp90 clients might also be
inhibited by ganetespib, contributing to the difference. Overall, these data indicate that the
effect of ganetespib is largely due to targeting mutp53, as it had no effect in p53-null mice
(Fig. 4f, g). Moreover, consistent with superior potency of ganetespib vs 17DMAG+SAHA,
weekly ganetespib monotherapy improved overall survival more efficiently than near-daily
17DMAG+SAHA therapy (Extended Fig. 4n).

Ganetespib treatment also correlated with absence of T-lymphomas in 2 of 2 Q/− sibling
pairs, while DMSO-treated siblings exhibited large T-lymphomas (Fig. 4k). Finally, thymic
tissues of Q/− mice analyzed at death again showed that when HSP90 inhibition was
achieved (Hsp70 induced), mutp53 T-lymphomagenesis was prevented (Fig. 4l), while all 5
T-lymphomas that arose despite ganetespib again showed no evidence of drug activity (no
Hsp70 induction) (Fig. 4l, 5/23 (22%) escapers). In colorectal cancers we recently identified
a major resistance mechanism for ganetespib (but not other classes of Hsp90i) via
upregulation of the drug-conjugating enzyme UGT1A in tumor cells, causing drug efflux
and tumor protection29. However, in mutp53 T-lymphomas UGT1A (mRNA and protein)
did not correlate with ganetespib resistance, necessitating future genomic analysis to identify
alternative mechanisms. Overall, these data indicate tumor dependence on high levels of
mutp53 and demonstrate mutp53-dependent drug effects.

Author Manuscript

Missense mutp53 is highly expressed in 40–50% of all human tumors. One therapeutic
strategy considered for nearly two decades is to develop small compounds capable of
restoring the lost wildtype function of mutp53 proteins30. In the face of this daunting and
still elusive goal, the results presented here show that eliminating stabilized mutp53 protein
can have positive therapeutic effects in vivo, even in the absence of wildtype p53, since such
tumors show exploitable dependence on its GOF. Targeting HSP90 represents the first and
currently only viable clinical strategy to achieve this goal.

Methods
Generation of floxQ;ERT2 mice

Author Manuscript

The floxed HUPKI p53R248Q allele (referred to as floxQ) was generated by introducing
loxP sites flanking exons 2 through 10 of the p53 locus where mouse exons 4–9 were
replaced with human exons 4–9 containing a p53 R248Q mutation in Exon 7, as described in
Extended Fig. 1a–c. p53floxQ/+ were crossed with p53−/− mice on a 129SvImJ/C57Bl6J
mixed background as previously described2 to generate p53floxQ/− animals. p53floxQ/−
animals were then intercrossed with p53Q/− animals (previously described in Hanel et al.,
20132) to generate p53floxQ/Q mice on a 129SvImJ/C57Bl6J background.
Rosa26CreERT2/CreERT2 mice (referred to as ERT2) on a pure C57Bl6J background31 were
purchased from Jackson labs (stock # 008463) and intercrossed with the mixed p53−/−
animals to generate p53−/−; Rosa26ERT2/ERT2 mice. p53−/−; Rosa26ERT2/ERT2 were
intercrossed with p53floxQ/Q or p53−/− to generate the p53floxQ/−; Rosa26ERT2/+, p53Q/−;
Rosa26ERT2/+, and p53−/−; Rosa26ERT2/+ cohorts.

were also previously described2,28. Note that two different p53−/− control strains were used
as corresponding genetic background-matching controls for H/H mice (pure C57BL/6J

palpable tumor reached 2 cm3 or ulcerated. Males and females were used at 1:1 ratio (except
for Nu/Nu mice, only males were used). According to Stony Brook University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines and our approved protocol, the
maximum tumor burden per mouse is 4 cm3, which was strictly followed in all experiments.
Time of euthanasia was considered endpoint. All animals were treated humanely and
according to the guidelines by the IACUC of Stony Brook University.
Lymphoma cell isolation and allograft transplants

Author Manuscript

Primary T-lymphoma cells were isolated by mechanically mincing T-lymphoma tumors
with a razor blade for 1 min, followed by 5 min incubation with 5 ml Red Blood Cell (RBC)
lysis buffer at room temperature. 5 ml Lymphoma medium (1:1 DMEM/IMDM
supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, Penicillin/Streptomycin, Antibiotic/
Antimycotic, β-mercaptoethanol) (all from Gibco) was added and cells were passed through
a 40 µm Nylon cell strainer (Falcon) to remove cell clumps. Cells were spun down and
resuspended in Lymphoma medium. Primary B-lymphoma cells were isolated similarly,
except for the addition of 100 µl of 3M sodium acetate during mincing to prevent blood
coagulation and a second round of RBC/ Lymphoma medium /spinning. Freshly isolated
live B- and T-lymphoma cells were counted and either frozen or immediately used for in
vitro studies or transplantations (allografts). For subcutaneous (s.c.) transplantation, 6–7 wks
old Nu/Nu males (Harlan, strain Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu) were injected into four dorsal
sites with 105 lymphoma cells per site suspended in 3:1 PBS/Matrigel (BD Biosciences). For
intravenous (i.v.) tail vein injections, 105 cells in PBS were injected per Nu/Nu recipient.
Removal of the conditional floxQ allele

Author Manuscript

To remove the floxQ allele in cells in vitro, T-lymphoma cells (15×106 live cells per 6 cm
dish) grown in Lymphoma medium were treated with 1 µM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT,
Sigma Cat # H7904) in EtOH for the times indicated in Extended Fig. 1e.
To remove the floxQ allele in T-lymphoma allografts, randomly assigned mice were injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg Tamoxifen (Sigma Cat # T5648) in
corn oil, or with corn oil alone, as indicated in Fig. 1 and Extended Fig. 1. For the
prophylactic protocol typically 9 daily i.p. injections beginning 2 days prior to lymphoma
cell transplantation were given. For the therapeutic protocol 5 to 7 daily i.p. injections were
given after at least two out of four palpable tumors had appeared.

Author Manuscript

For autochthonous tumors, to remove the floxQ allele in mice with early organ-confined
disease, randomly assigned 10 wk old animals were injected i.p. with 100 mg/kg Tamoxifen
in corn oil, or corn oil alone, daily for 5 consecutive days (Fig. 2f–h, Extended Fig. 2c–f).
As a pre-set criterion, animals that died from non-cancer-related causes (the minority) were
excluded from subsequent analyses. To treat clinically advanced tumors (Fig. 2a–e), animals
were monitored weekly by ultrasound imaging using the Visual Sonics Vevo 770 HighResolution Imaging System. When tumors had reached 150 mm3 on average (ranging from
86–218 mm3), mice were injected with 150 mg/kg Tamoxifen daily for 7 days, followed by
100 mg/kg three times a week, or oil alone, until they needed to be sacrificed (endpoint). To

HSP90 is crucial for cancer cell survival32. Cultured cells were treated with 2.5 µM or 5 µM
17AAG (17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, LC Laboratories, Cat # A-6880) or
5-500 nM ganetespib in DMSO for 24h or 48h. For xenografts, human cancer cells were
subcutaneously injected into nude mice (0.5 Mio cells per site in 100 µl Matrigel, 4 sites per
mouse). Tumors became visible around day 10. For Fig. 3a and Extended Fig. 3, treatment
of 10 mg/kg 17AAG and/or 25mg/kg SAHA (Vorinostat / Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid,
LC Laboratories, Cat # V-8477) in DMSO or vehicle control was started at day 24 every
other day, with endpoint at day 44 or earlier in the few cases where tumors became
ulcerated.

For 17DMAG+SAHA treatments of H/H and corresponding p53−/− mice, 17DMAG (17Dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, LC Laboratories Cat # D-3440), a
hydrophilic derivative of 17AAG33, was dissolved in 5% (weight/vol) Hydroxypropyl-βcyclodextrin (HOP-β-CD) (Sigma Cat # 332607), and SAHA (LC Laboratories Cat #
V-8477) was dissolved in a 5 molar equivalent of HOP-β-CD as previously described34.
Equal volumes of 17DMAG and SAHA (or both vehicle solutions) were combined and
frozen in aliquots until use. Starting at 8 wks of age, randomly assigned animals received
100 µl i.p. injections of 10 mg/kg 17DMAG plus 25 mg/kg SAHA, or 100 µL HOP-β-CD
vehicle, for 5 days a week until endpoint (death). As a pre-set criterion, animals that died
from non-cancer-related causes (the minority) were excluded from subsequent analyses.

For ganetespib treatments of H/H and Q/− mice with their corresponding p53−/− control
cohorts, ganetespib (aka STA-9090, Synta Pharmaceuticals) was dissolved in 10%
DMSO/18% cremophor/3.6% dextrose (‘10/18 DRD’) as previously described35. For
reference, rodents safely tolerate doses of ganetespib of up to 150 mg/kg once weekly or 75
mg/kg twice weekly36. Randomly assigned animals received freshly prepared ganetespib or
the corresponding volume of 10/18 DRD vehicle by tail vein injection as follows: 50 mg/kg
ganetespib once a week starting at 8 wks of age until death for the treatment of
autochthonous tumors (including the sibling analysis in Fig. 4j); 75 mg/kg ganetespib twice
a week for the treatment of T- and B-lymphoma allografts (beginning 1 day prior to
lymphoma transplantation in the prophylactic protocol, or beginning when at least 2 out of 4
palpable tumors per mouse had appeared in the therapeutic protocol); 150 mg/kg of
ganetespib once or twice for acute high dose treatment (Fig. 4c, d). As a pre-set criterion,
animals that died from non-cancer-related causes (the minority) were excluded from
subsequent analyses. For the sibling analysis (Fig. 4j), the sisters were sacrificed at 90 days
and the brothers at 148 days, each 24 hrs after their last treatment, and their thymic tissues
were subject to immunoblot analysis. Cyclophosphamide was dissolved in PBS and injected
i.p. at indicated doses.

housekeeping gene HPRT.
Statistics
Statistical tests with appropriate underlying assumptions on data distribution and variance
characteristics were used. Kaplan-Meier analyses with Log Rank statistics for animal
survival curves were generated using SigmaPlot-Systat Software version 11. Note: in Fig. 3e
and Fig. 4h dots represent censored animals, i.e. mice dead due to cancer types other than Tlymphomas. Each line ends when the last animal dies (if due to T-lymphoma, the line goes
down to zero, if due to another cancer type, the animal is censored and the line stops with a
dot).

Extended Data Figure 1. Generation and characterization of the conditionally inactivatable p53
flox R248Q allele

a–c, Generation of the conditionally inactivatable p53 R248Qflox allele. Mouse Exons 4–9
were replaced with human Exons 4–9 (called HUPKI, humanized p53 knockin) containing a
p53 R248Q mutation in Exon 7 (marked by *). Exons 2–10 were flanked with loxP sites in
Introns 1 and 10 (red arrows) to allow for Cre-targeted removal of the mutp53 allele upon
addition of Tamoxifen/4OHT. A deletable Neo selection box was flanked by FRT sites

(green). Knockin mice were mated with FLP mice to delete the Neo cassette in vivo, leaving
behind the distal loxP site. The ‘floxQ’ allele thus has two loxP sites for subsequent Cre
deletion. (b) For genotyping, the Neo-deleted floxQ knockin (KI) allele produces a 657 bp
amplicon, in contrast to the 490 bp amplicon derived from the wtp53 allele. (c) Normal
mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from floxQ/− embryos, which as non-malignant cells
express non-stabilized mutp53, were adenovirally infected with empty vector (-Cre) or Creexpressing vector (+Cre). Cre-mediated deletion of the mutp53 allele was confirmed by
immunoblot analysis.
d, The floxQ and constitutive Q (‘Q’) alleles behave identically in all aspects of gain-offunction including overall survival and tumor spectrum (not shown). Both floxQ and Q mice
predominantly develop aggressive T-lymphomas, with some additional B-lymphomas and
sarcomas. Also, the RosaCreERT2 allele has no discernable impact (data not shown).
Kaplan-Meier analysis comparing overall survival of floxQ/− (red), Q/− (blue) and p53−/−
(black) mice. Significance was assessed by Log Rank and Wilcoxon tests.
e, Deletion of the mutp53 allele induces cell death in vitro. Viability of primary Tlymphoma cells freshly harvested from floxQ/−;ERT2/+ mice (n=4) and Q/−;ERT2/+
control mice (n=3), untreated or treated once with 4OHT or vehicle (EtOH) in short-term
culture for 3–6 days. CTB assay, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test; mean ± s.e.m; n,
number of independent T-lymphomas. Bottom, corresponding immunoblots of
representative T-lymphomas at day 6.
f, mutp53 deletion improves survival of host mice. Therapeutic protocol with primary floxQ/
− T-lymphomas allotransplanted (black arrow on time axis) via subcutaneous injections into
SCID mice. After visible tumors appeared, SCID mice were treated with daily
intraperitoneal injections of oil or Tamoxifen (* on time axis). Mice were sacrificed when
allowable endpoint size (1.5 cm3) was reached. Kaplan-Meier analysis, Log Rank test.
Tamoxifen-induced allele deletion was strong but incomplete, shown by representative p53
immunofluorescence staining of tumors at endpoint (DAPI counterstain).
g, Initial tumor volumes measured before treatment was started in the therapeutic protocol of
the various groups shown in Fig. 1c. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test; mean ± s.e.m; n,
number of allografts.
h, Control for Fig. 1d. Therapeutic treatment of nude mice allografted with p53−/−;ERT2/+
T-lymphoma cells and treated with Tam (150 mg/kg for 7 days) as indicated in the scheme
in Fig. 1c (Endpoint 2). No response to Tam. Time-course, initial allograft volume and
tumor mass at endpoint. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test; mean ± s.e.m; n, number of

regression or stagnation and extends T-lymphoma-specific survival

a, Time-course of imaged tumors, normalized to their initial tumor size (same as Fig. 2a but
zoomed into the first 12 days of treatment). Stagnation or regression of floxQ/−;ERT2/+
tumors treated with Tam, in contrast to treated control tumors (floxQ/−;ERT2/+ on oil and
Q/−;ERT2/+ on Tam) which grow robustly. #, sarcomas; all others are T-lymphomas.
b, Similar mitotic index supports that cell cycle arrest and senescence are not significantly
affected upon genetic mutp53 ablation in autochthonous T-lymphomas (from Fig. 2a–c) and

s.c. allografts (from Fig. 1c, d). Instead, apoptosis is the main mechanism of tumor
regression/stagnation. Quantification of phospho-S28 histone H3 (pH3) positive cells in
individual autochthonous tumors or allografts. Five (left) or three (right) random 40× high
power fields (with no or only minimal apoptosis) were counted for each tumor. Plotted are
mean ± s.d. Representative pH3 immunostainings are shown.
c–e, Kaplan-Meier analyses comparing Tamoxifen-treated T-lymphoma specific survival (c,
e) and overall (d) survival of floxQ/−;ERT2/+ mice vs constitutive Q/−;ERT2/+ and p53−/
−;ERT2/+ control mice from Fig. 2g. Animals were treated once (arrow) at 10 wks with oil
or Tamoxifen by i.p injections for 5 consecutive days.
f, At endpoint (death), like T-lymphomas (Fig. 2h), also most sarcomas in Tamoxifentreated floxQ/−;ERT2/+ mice are again entirely composed of p53-positive cells. This
indicates strong selective pressure for mutp53-positive tumor cells in that the small minority
of non-recombined malignant cells outcompeted the vast majority of recombined mutp53deleted cells and with time took over the tumor mass, supporting tumor addiction to high
levels of mutp53. Out of 10 sarcomas, 9 (90%) stained positive for p53 and only 1 (10%)
was negative for p53. p53 immunostainings of representative fibro- and angiosarcomas are
shown. Note, the blue cells in oil-treated osteosarcoma are normal stromal cells.

and in human non-small cell lung cancer xenografts H1975 (p53 R273H) (f). (f) Nude mice
bearing tumor xenografts (each lane is an independent tumor) were treated with a single
bolus of DMSO or ganetespib (50 mg/kg i.v.). Tumors were harvested at baseline (30 min),
48 hr and 72 hr. Cells were lysed and tumors homogenized and immunoblotted as indicated.
Chk1 and CDK1 are other Hsp90 clients, cleaved PARP indicates activated apoptosis.
g, h, Ganetespib decreases stabilized mutp53 levels in live Q/− T-lymphoma cells within 24
h, associated with induction of apoptosis. (g) Freshly isolated live Q/− T-lymphoma cells
were treated with DMSO or 50 nM ganetespib for 24h, followed by immunoblots as
indicated. Hsp70 indicates drug activity. Hsc70 is the loading control. (h) Death curves of
freshly isolated Q/− and p53−/− T-lymphoma cells treated with DMSO or 50 nM ganetespib

Subcutaneous allografts of Q/− and H/H T-lymphoma cells were treated once (arrow) with
the indicated doses of ganetespib or cyclophosphamide alone or in combination. The mean
(± s.e.m.) allograft size for Q/− and H/H at the start of treatment was 274 ± 36 mm3 and 323
± 44 mm3, respectively. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test; n, number of allografts. Each
single drug is compared to the combination. * p<0.05 or ** p<0.01.
l, Comparison of ganetespib treatment of floxQ/− vs corresponding p53−/− control mice
from Fig. 4g. floxQ/− mice, which normally have a significantly shorter lifespan than p53null littermates2 (median 139d vs 195d, respectively, see also Extended Fig. 1d) respond to
ganetespib with significantly longer survival (right shift) and now resemble that of p53−/−
mice. Kaplan-Meier analysis.
m, n, Ganetespib monotherapy once a week improves overall survival more efficiently than
either genetic mutp53 ablation or 17DMAG+SAHA given 5 times a week. (m) Comparison
of Kaplan-Meier survival curves of Tam-treated floxQ/− animals from Fig. 2g and
ganetespib-treated floxQ/− animals from Fig. 4g. Note, based on their phenotypic identity
(see Extended Fig. 1d), floxQ/− mice were used in Fig. 4g in lieu of Q/− to ensure direct
comparability with Tam treatment. (n) Comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves of
17DMAG+SAHA treated H/H animals from Fig. 3c and ganetespib-treated H/H animals

ganetespib or vehicle (DMSO). (a) Arrowhead, tumor cell injection. (b) Initial allograft
volume and mass at endpoint, mean ± s.e.m, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test; n, number
of allografts. (c, d) Time-course of mutp53 levels and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) in
ganetespib-treated (arrows) Q/− subcutaneous T-lymphoma allografts, analyzed by
immunoblot (c) and immunostaining (d). Asterisks mark non-specific bands. Enlarged

panels after the 1st and 2nd doses (d, far right) immunostained for p53 (arrows), dead cells
stain blue. (e) Growth of subcutaneous Q/− T-lymphoma allografts treated once (arrow) with
ganetespib or cyclophosphamide alone or in combination. Mean ± s.e.m, unpaired two-tailed
Student’s t-test; n, number of allografts, * p<0.05, ** p<0.01 (single drugs vs combination).
(f–h) Kaplan-Meier analysis of cancer-related overall survival (f, g) and T-lymphoma
specific survival (h) of mutp53 H/H, Q/− and their respective p53−/− controls. (i) Fold
growth over time of clinically advanced Q/− and p53−/− T-lymphomas imaged by
ultrasound and treated with ganetespib; normalized to initial tumor size. Mean ± s.e.m,
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test; n, number of tumors, * p<0.05. (j) Comparison of
overall survival of ganetespib-treated mutp53 H/H and their respective p53−/− controls,
shown in (f). (k, l) Immunoblot analysis of thymic tissues from same-litter siblings (k) and
from Q/− mice from (h) at endpoint. Each lane represents individual DMSO or ganetespibtreated mice.
