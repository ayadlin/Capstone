Abstract
Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is an aggressive bone malignancy that
mainly affects children and young adults. The mechanisms by
which EWS (EWSR1) fusion genes drive the disease are not fully
understood. CRM1 (XPO1) trafﬁcs proteins from the nucleus,
including tumor suppressors and growth factors, and is overexpressed in many cancers. A small-molecule inhibitor of CRM1,
KPT-330, has shown therapeutic promise, but has yet to be
investigated in the context of EWS. In this study, we demonstrate
that CRM1 is also highly expressed in EWS. shRNA-mediated or
pharmacologic inhibition of CRM1 in EWS cells dramatically
decreased cell growth while inducing apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest,
and protein expression alterations to several cancer-related factors. Interestingly, silencing of CRM1 markedly reduced EWS–

FLI1 fusion protein expression at the posttranscriptional level and
upregulated the expression of the well-established EWS-FLI1
target gene, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3
(IGFBP3), which inhibits IGF-1. Accordingly, KPT-330 treatment
attenuated IGF-1–induced activation of the IGF-1R/AKT pathway.
Furthermore, knockdown of IGFBP3 increased cell growth and
rescued the inhibitory effects on IGF-1 signaling triggered by
CRM1 inhibition. Finally, treatment of EWS cells with a combination of KPT-330 and the IGF-1R inhibitor, linsitinib, synergistically decreased cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Taken
together, these ﬁndings provide a strong rationale for investigating the efﬁcacy of combinatorial inhibition of CRM1 and IGF-1R
for the treatment of EWS. Cancer Res; 76(9); 2687–97. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

the development of more innovative and effective therapies.
EWS is characterized by chromosomal translocations that fuse
the EWS gene to an E26 transformation-speciﬁc transcription
factor, most commonly FLI1 (3). This major driver event is
accompanied by few additional mutations, highlighting the
importance of the EWS fusion protein in this disease (3–7).
EWS-FLI1 acts as an oncogenic transcriptional factor, which
enhances the survival and growth of EWS cells (8) through
either activating or repressing thousands of genes (8, 9). CRM1 (also known as XPO1) is a major nuclear export protein
responsible for trafﬁcking hundreds of proteins and RNAs out
of the nucleus (10). CRM-1 cargos include many tumor-suppressor and growth-stimulating proteins, such as p53, p73,
p21cip1, p27kip1, STAT3, FOXO, APC, BRCA1, survivin, and IkB
(11, 12). CRM1 is upregulated in several types of cancer, and its
overexpression correlates with a poor prognosis (11, 13–17).
Importantly, CRM1 inhibition by the potent small-molecule
selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE), KPT-330, has been
suggested as a promising therapeutic option for a number of
cancer types (18–23). In this study, we characterized the
biologic signiﬁcance of CRM1 in the context of EWS and
determined the therapeutic merit of CRM1 inhibition for this
malignancy.

Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is one of the most common and
aggressive bone malignancies in children and young adults.
Surgery and chemotherapy either with or without radiotherapy
can cure 70% of patients, but those with metastatic disease are
usually refractory (1, 2). Therefore, a compelling need exists for

purchased from Dharmacon. Bone marrow cells from normal
donors were purchased from AllCells.
Cell culture, drug treatment, and cell viability assays
EWS cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Kimberly Stegmaier
(Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and Dr. Stephen L. Lessnick (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT), and were grown in
DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and
streptomycin. RH5 and MLS402 cell line were kindly provided by
Dr. Javed Khan (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and
Dr. Pierre Åman (University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden), respectively. The identity of all cell lines was recently veriﬁed
by short tandem repeat analysis. Cell viability assays and analysis
of drug synergy were performed as previously described (18). The
extent of interaction between two drugs was presented using the
combination index (CI; ref. 24).
Apoptosis and cell-cycle assays
Cells were seeded at 50% conﬂuency in 6-well plates, and
after overnight incubation, culture media were replaced with
fresh media containing either diluent control or indicated drugs.
After 24-hour incubation, cells were washed with PBS and
stained with both propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V (BD
Biosciences), and assayed on a LSRII ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell-cycle analysis was performed by PI staining
(Sigma-Aldrich) for DNA content and followed by ﬂow cytometric analysis. All ﬂow cytometry data were analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry
Protein lysates from cells were extracted using ProteoJET Mammalian Cell Lysis Reagent (Thermo Scientiﬁc), and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Protein lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF
membrane (Merck Millipore), and followed by immunoblotting
procedures as previously described (18). To prepare nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions, cells were lysed in 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.9), 10 mmol/L KCL, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.6% NP-40, 1 mmol/L
DTT, and protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and centrifuged
at 16,000 g for 10 minutes to collect the soluble fraction (cytosolic
extract). Insoluble pellets were lysed with the lysis buffer [20
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 mol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.6%
NP-40, 1 mmol/L DTT, and protease inhibitors] and centrifuged
at 16,000 g for 10 minutes to collect the nuclear extracts. The

2688 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were then subjected to immunoblotting analysis. The immunohistochemistry was performed
with standard procedures as previously described (18). CRM1
expression was scored using the H-score method as previously
described (25).
Lentiviral infections
The target sequence of shCRM1 in pLKO.1 lentiviral vector is 50 GCTCAAGAAGTACTGACACAT-30 . Cells were transduced with
viral particles in the presence of 8 mg/mL polybrene for 16 hours
followed by replacement of the lentivirus-containing media with
fresh media. Two days after infection, puromycin (2 mg/mL) was
added for 3 days to eliminate uninfected cells.
PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy isolation Kit (Qiagen). For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), cDNA was
generated using the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta Biosciences). qRT-PCR was performed on CFX96 qPCR System
(Biorad Inc). Expression of each gene was normalized to GAPDH
as a reference. Primers for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary
Table S1.
Animal models
All animal studies were approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Seven-week-old female
athymic nude mice [Crl:NU(NCr)-Foxn1nu] were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories and inoculated subcutaneously in both
ﬂanks with a suspension of EW8 or TC32 cells (2.0  106) in
Matrigel. Five days after injection of cancer cells as tumor xenografts were noted to be growing, the mice were randomly divided
into four groups: orally treated with either vehicle [0.6% w/v
aqueous Pluronic F-68 (Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.), n ¼ 10],
KPT-330 (20 mg/kg, n ¼ 8), linsitinib (20 mg/kg, n ¼ 8), or
KPT-330 plus linsitinib (20 mg/kg each, n ¼ 8), thrice weekly  4
weeks. Mice were given Nutri-Cal (Tomlyn) during experimentation to improve nutrition. Tumor volumes were measured thrice
weekly with calipers and were calculated using the following
formula: volume (mm3) ¼ [width (mm)]2  length (mm)/2.
Statistical analysis
The mRNA expression levels of CRM1 from various types of
primary cancer tissues and cell lines were examined by analyzing Expression Project for Oncology ExpO dataset (URL:
https://expo.intgen.org/geo/) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE, URL: http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle; ref. 26),
respectively. Combinatorial effects of KPT-330 with linsitinib
were examined by MTT, and three-dimensional scatter plots
(URL: https://plot.ly/feed/) were used to view drug–drug interactions as previously described (27, 28). The synergism was
analyzed by isobologram analysis using the CompuSyn software program (24). All ﬁgures from MTT assays are a representative of three replicates. Differences between two groups were
analyzed using either paired or unpaired two-tailed Student t
test. One-way ANOVA was used for comparisons among
multiple groups ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01). Overlaps of
gene lists were identiﬁed using online program VENN (URL:
http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/). Statistical
signiﬁcance of overlapping was determined using c2 tests with
one degree of freedom and Yates's correction as previously
described (29).

Results
CRM1 is upregulated in EWS
To evaluate the expression of CRM1 in EWS, we ﬁrst analyzed
1,911 primary samples from 72 different types of tumors from
ExpO (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S2). Notably, CRM1 mRNA
expression in EWS tumors was the ﬁfth highest among these 72
different cancer types, higher than those tumors that have been
shown to have overexpression of CRM1 (11, 13–17). CCLE
database analysis also showed that CRM1 mRNA expression in
EWS ranked ﬁrst among 38 different types of cancer cell lines (Fig.
1B; Supplementary Table S3). To determine the expression level of
CRM1 protein in EWS, we performed IHC staining on 37 primary
EWS tissues and analyzed the staining levels by the H-score
method (25). The analysis revealed that 11 samples showed
strong nuclear staining (30%, H-score value > 199), 13 samples
with moderate nuclear staining (38%, H-score value > 99), and 12
samples showed weak nuclear staining (32%, H-score value 0–
99; Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S4). In addition, CRM1 protein
was strongly expressed in all 9 EWS cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S1). These results demonstrated that CRM1 is highly expressed in
EWS.
Inhibition of CRM1 decreased cell viability by inducing both
apoptosis and G1 cell-cycle arrest
To determine the biologic signiﬁcance of CRM1 in EWS,
CRM1 was suppressed either by shRNA-mediated knockdown
or with the SINE compound KPT-330. Knockdown of CRM1
signiﬁcantly decreased EWS cell proliferation (Fig. 2A–C), and
treatment of KPT-330 dose-dependently inhibited cell viability
in all 9 EWS cell lines tested with a mean IC50 of approximately
400 nmol/L (Fig. 2D). In addition, KPT-330 markedly inhibited
clonogenic growth in EWS cells (Fig. 2E). Moreover, CRM1
inhibition signiﬁcantly blocked cells in the G1 phase (Fig. 2F

www.aacrjournals.org

and G) and induced massive apoptosis (Fig. 2H). In order to
test the therapeutic window of KPT-330, we obtained bone
marrow samples from three healthy donors, isolated normal
CD34þ cells, and measured their dose response to KPT-330
treatment by MTT assay. Results showed a mean IC50 of about
9.4 mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S2), at least 20 times higher
than that in EWS cells, suggesting a wide therapeutic window of
KPT-330.
Inhibition of CRM1 induced cytotoxicity by repressing EWSFLI1 and releasing its targeted gene IGFBP3
CRM1 is an important nuclear transporting protein, which
regulates the localization of many proteins and mRNAs involved
in cell cycle and apoptosis (11, 13–17). To examine downstream
targets of CRM1 in EWS, immunoblotting was conducted. Inhibition of CRM1 with shCRM1 or KPT-330 treatment deregulated
the expression of several cancer-related proteins, including cyclin
D1, p27kip1, p53, p21cip1, and p-MET (Fig. 3A). Notably, CRM1
inhibition (either KPT-330 or shRNA treatment) decreased p53
protein levels in TP53 wild-type cell lines TC32 and CADO-ES, but
not in TP53-mutant cell lines (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Furthermore, silencing of p53 by siRNA signiﬁcantly decreased
KPT-330–induced apoptosis in TC32 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3B), which was in line with previous ﬁndings in TP53 wild-type
leukemic cells (30–34). However, overall no signiﬁcant correlation occurred between the IC50 of EWS cell lines and the mutational status of TP53 in these cells (R2 ¼ 0.27; P ¼ 0.15).
Interestingly, EWS-FLI1 was decreased upon CRM1 inhibition
(Fig. 3A and B). In contrast, KPT-330 only modestly decreased
the level of the fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1 in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RH5 and did not affect the expression of FUSDDIT3 in the myxoid liposarcoma cell line MLS402 (Supplementary Fig. S4).

by MTT assay. D, cell viability of 9 EWS cell lines, and inhibition of growth was measured by MTT assay. E clonogenic assay of three EWS cell lines. Inhibition of growth
was measured by counting colonies using open CFU software (http://opencfu.sourceforge.net/). Right, bar graphs displayed colony numbers in each
treatment group. F and G, EWS cells were stably infected with either a shCRM1 or NC control (F), or cells were treated with different concentrations of
KPT-330 for 48 hours and stained with PI (G). Bar graphs displayed the proportion of cells in G1 phase in each treatment group. H, EWS cells were treated
with KPT-330 for 24 hours, and Annexin/PI assays were conducted to evaluate the ability of KPT-330 to induce apoptosis. Bar graphs display the percentage
of apoptotic cells (positive Annexin V þ PI) in each treatment group. Data (B–H) represent mean  SD, n ¼ 3.

We next asked whether EWS-FLI1 was involved in the cell
cytotoxicity mediated by CRM1 inhibition. As expected, silencing
of EWS-FLI1 through siRNAs decreased EWS cell growth (Fig. 3C

1,004 (2,201 transcripts) genes were upregulated (log2 > 0.5
comparing with DMSO group) upon KPT-330 treatment in EW8
and SKES1 cells, respectively. Venn diagram analysis showed that
172 and 352 genes were codownregulated and coupregulated in
these two different cell lines, respectively. The co-occurrence of
these alterations was statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.00001, c2 tests

knockdown of EWS-FLI1 upregulated 2,415 and downregulated

CRM1 Inhibition in Ewing Sarcoma

that were upregulated by knockdown of EWS-FLI1 was statistically
signiﬁcantly similar (P < 0.0001; Fig 3I; Supplementary Table S6).
Similarly, the downregulated genes also signiﬁcantly overlapped
(P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S6; Supplementary Table S6).
Notably, many EWS-FLI1–regulated genes, including two IGF1–binding proteins (IGFBP3 and IGFBP5), were upregulated by
either KPT-330 treatment or knockdown of EWS-FLI1 (Fig. 3H;
Supplementary Table S5). IGFBP3 is an important EWS-FlLI1
transcriptionally repressed gene, which has been shown to bind
and inhibit IGF-1 (35). Constitutive activation of the IGF-1
pathway in EWS was partly attributable to the downregulation
of IGFBP3 by EWS-FLI1 (36). The regulation of IGFBP3 by KPT330 was further conﬁrmed by both qRT-PCR and immunoblotting approaches (Fig. 3J and K). Moreover, we also observed that
KPT-330 attenuated AKT activation stimulated by IGF-1 (Fig. 3L),
and addition of IGF-1 (50 ng/mL) signiﬁcantly enhanced cell
viability in the presence of KPT-330 (Fig. 3M). In contrast, HGF
(50 ng/mL) did not have a rescue effect (Fig. 3M), consistent
with its negligible effect on p-AKT activation in EWS cells
(data not shown). These results indicated that CRM1 regulated
the EWS-FLI1/IGFBP3 pathway, and AKT signaling played a
central role in mediating the resistance to both linsitinib and
KPT-330 in EWS.
c-MET inhibitor, crizotinib, synergistically enhanced cell
killing in combination with KPT-330
As shown in Fig. 3A, CRM1 inhibition also caused downregulation of p-MET expression. c-MET is a receptor tyrosine
kinase essential for many cellular actions, and its abnormal
activation in cancers, including EWS, correlates with a poor
prognosis (37). Targeting c-MET is recognized as a promising
opportunity for treatment of human cancers (38, 39). Crizotinib
is a c-MET/ALK inhibitor, which has previously been shown to
have modest antineoplastic effect against EWS cells in vitro (40). In
agreement with the prior study, we found crizotinib had a similar
inhibitory effect on EWS cell lines, with an IC50 about 2 mmol/L
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). Notably, combined exposure of both
KPT-330 and crizotinib showed synergistic activity against growth
of EW8 and SKES1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C).
Our results indicate that dual inhibition of c-MET signaling by
KPT-330 and crizotinib might be a potential therapeutic option
for targeting EWS.
Silencing of IGFBP3 rescued the inhibitory effect of CRM1
inhibition in EWS cells
To examine further the role of IGFBP3 in EWS cells, IGFBP3 was
silenced using lentivirus-based siRNA transduction. siIGFBP3
efﬁciently silenced IGFBP3 (Fig. 4A and B) in EW8, TC32, and
SKES1 cells. This caused an increased proliferation of these cells
(Fig. 4C). Furthermore, silencing of IGFBP3 increased both p-AKT
and p-IGF-1R levels (Fig. 4E). Importantly, knockdown of IGFBP3
partly rescued the inhibitory effect of either KPT-330 treatment
(Fig. 4D) or CRM1 knockdown (Fig. 4E and F).
Combination of KPT-330 with linsitinib synergistically
inhibited growth of EWS cells
Development of EWS relies on activation of the IGF-1 pathway (35). As an important IGF-1 signaling partner, IGF-1R is
recognized as a promising target against this disease (41).
Linsitinib (OSI-906) is a potent, orally available small-molecule inhibitor of IGF-1R, which has acceptable tolerability and

preliminary evidence of anti-EWS activity (42, 43). We ﬁrst
determined its IC50 for the EWS cell lines in vitro (Fig 5A).
Inspired by our observations that CRM1 inhibition targeted
EWS-FLI1/IGFBP3/IGF-1R signaling, we tested whether CRM1
inhibition and linsitinib might have synergistic anti-EWS
effects. Combination of KPT-330 with linsitinib synergistically
impaired EWS cell viability in EW8 (mean CI, 0.79), TC32
(mean CI, 0.56), and SKES1 cells (mean CI, 0.44; Fig. 5B).
Similarly, shRNA-mediated CRM1 silencing achieved more
potent anti-EWS effects when combined with linsitinib, but as
expected not when combined with KPT-330 (Fig. 5C, left and
middle). Knockdown of IGFBP3 rescued the inhibitory effect of
linsitinib in EW8, TC32, and SKES1 cells (Fig. 5C, right). In
addition, combination of KPT-330 with linsitinib induced
more apoptosis (Fig. 5D) and cell-cycle arrest (Fig. 5E). Moreover, compared with single agent, combination treatment further decreased the expression of progrowth factors, including
cyclin D1 and p-AKT, and enhanced the proapoptotic factors,
such as BAK, BAX, and IGFBP3 (Fig. 5F).
Combination of KPT-330 with linsitinib signiﬁcantly inhibited
EWS growth in vivo
We next examined the anti-EWS property of KPT330 in EW8
(TP53 mutant) and TC32 (TP53 wild-type) xenograft models.
As shown in Fig. 6, either KPT-330 or linsitinib alone markedly
decreased tumor burden compared with vehicle controls in
both models (Fig. 6A–F). Importantly, combinational treatment achieved signiﬁcantly more potent antitumor effects (Fig.
6A–C) in EW8 xenograft model. Consistent with the in vitro
MTT assay (Fig. 2D), TC32 xenografts were more sensitive to
KPT-330 treatment than EW8 in vivo (Fig. 6A–F). Due to the
dramatic anti-EWS activity mediated by KPT-330 alone, no
signiﬁcant synergistic effect was observed by the combination
treatment of the TC32 xenografts (Fig. 6D–F). As shown in Fig.
3L and M, IGFBP3/IGF-1R/p-AKT signaling was regulated by
inhibiting CRM1. Therefore, the tumor lysates were examined
for expression of p-AKT. Treatment by either KPT-330 alone or
in combination with linsitinib robustly decreased the levels of
p-AKT (Fig. 6G). We speculate on the mechanisms of synergism
with dual inhibition of CRM1 and IGF-1 signaling pathway
on Fig. 6H.

Discussion
Until now, more than 240 nuclear proteins have been experimentally conﬁrmed as CRM1-binding cargos (44), many of
which are tumor suppressors. Overexpression of CRM1 in cancers
causes dysfunction of cell fate regulators and promotes the malignancy of cancer cells. A number of recent studies have shown that
targeting CRM1 produces an effective antitumor activity (18–23).
Here, by analyzing multiple databases and IHC staining results
(Fig. 1), we discovered that CRM1 is highly expressed in EWS,
suggesting that it may have important roles in regulation of EWS
tumorigenesis.
We observed that inhibition of CRM1 in TP53 wild-type but
not in TP53-mutant EWS cell lines resulted in an increased
expression of p53. Furthermore, silencing of p53 in TC32 cells
(TP53 wild-type) decreased the activity of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These ﬁndings are congruent with the
previous ﬁndings in TP53 wild-type leukemic cells (30–34).
However, the IC50 of EWS cell lines to KPT-330 and the

Combination of KPT-330 with linsitinib synergistically inhibited the growth of EWS cells. A, EWS cells were treated with different concentrations of linsitinb
(72 hours), and growth inhibition was measured by MTT assay. B, EWS cells were treated with KPT-330 (0, 50, 100, and 200 nmol/L) and/or linsitinib
(0, 100, 200, 400 nmol/L) for 72 hours, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Isobologram of the cell survival data was presented by three-dimensional
scatter plot, which indicated synergistic cytotoxicity. The color of the isobologram shift from white to black predicted cell viability (100%–20%), which is
indicative of synergism. C, EWS cells that were stably expressing either siIGFBP3, shCRM1, or NC control were generated and subjected to MTT assay upon indicated
treatment. D–F, EWS cells were treated with linsitinib (Lin, 1 mmol/L), KPT-330 (KPT, 200 nmol/L), or linsitinib (1 mmol/L) þ KPT-330 (200 nmol/L; LinþKPT)

mutational status of TP53 in these cells showed no signiﬁcant
correlation (R2 ¼ 0.27; P ¼ 0.15). p53 is an important cargo of
CRM1 (45, 46), but clearly for EWS, it is not a biomarker to predict
response to KPT-330. This appears to be the same in other studies
(18, 19, 47–51). For example, in one of our previous studies, we
showed that p73 plays an important role in mediating cell cycle

2694 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

and apoptosis upon CRM1 inhibition in lung cancer cells with
mutant TP53 (18). Taken together, p53 protein plays an important role in inducing cell apoptosis upon KPT-330 treatment in
cancer cells with wild-type TP53. But other CRM1 targets such as
TP73, IkB, are crucial for mediating KPT-330–dependent cytotoxicity in cancer cells with mutant TP53.

Combination of KPT-330 with linsitinib synergistically inhibited tumor growth. EW8 and TC32 cells were engrafted in nude mice and treated by gavage with

EWS cells have very few somatic mutations highlighting the
crucial role of the EWS fusion gene and its downstream pathways
in the pathogenesis of the disease (3). Among the numerous EWSFLI1–regulated genes, IGFBP3 is one of the most extensively
investigated. IGFBP3 belongs to the family of IGFBPs. It was
originally recognized as an inhibitor of circulating IGFs (52).
Beyond its role in transporting IGFs, IGFBP3 is a tumor suppressor, controlling cell proliferation and survival through interacting
with pericellular and intracellular compartments (36). In EWS,
EWS-FLI1 binds to the IGFBP3 promoter and transcriptionally
represses its expression, which in turn enhances IGF-1 signaling
(35). In this study, we discovered that EWS-FLI1 is a novel target of
CRM1 in several EWS cell lines (TC32, SKES1, and EW8). Either
genetic or chemical inhibition of CRM1 suppressed the expression
of EWS-FLI1, which released the transcriptional repression of
IGFBP3. KPT-330 is the most advanced SINE with >500 cancer

patients (hematologic and solid tumors) treated to date in phase
I/II clinical trials, and it has been shown to be efﬁcacious
in patients with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcoma (unpublished data). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that
inhibition of CRM1/EWS-FLI1/IGFBP3 pathway might be a valuable treatment approach for this disease.
Our study showed that CRM1 was highly expressed in all 9
EWS cell lines, and the CRM1 level did not correlate with the
sensitivity to KPT-330 treatment (R2 ¼ 0.13; P ¼ 0.33). In
agreement with our results, several studies have also shown the
lack of association between the expression level of CRM1 and
the responsiveness to CRM1 inhibitors in different cancer cell
lines. For example, Tai and colleagues and Zhang and colleagues found that multiple myeloma cell lines expressed similar
levels of CRM1 but varied in their IC50s to KPT inhibitors
(50, 51). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of KPT-330 on

different cells might not only depend on the expression level of
CRM1, but also rely on its downstream targets.
IGF-1R is a promising target in EWS, and several monoclonal
antibodies and chemical inhibitors have been developed (35).
Linsitinib (OSI-906) is a potent, selective IGF-1R inhibitor under
evaluation in a phase II trial (ORPHA394629) of EWS (42, 43).
However, it was found that prolonged treatment of EWS cells with
linsitinib in vivo caused reactivation of p-AKT (53, 54), which was
also observed in our in vivo experiments (Fig. 6G). Several studies
have shown that an enhanced anticancer effect can be achieved by
attacking more than one target in the same pathway by preventing
feedback stimulation. For example, Lito and colleagues discovered that RAF inhibitors caused ERK-dependent feedback by
reactivation of ligand-dependent signal transduction, and a MEK
inhibitor enhanced the antitumor activity of RAF inhibitors (55).
Our results demonstrated that dual inhibition of IGF-1 signaling
pathway by KPT-330 (which induces IGFBP3) and linsitinib
(which represses IGF-1R) achieved superior inhibitory effects
both in vitro and in vivo, providing a potentially promising strategy
for the treatment of EWS (Fig. 6H).
