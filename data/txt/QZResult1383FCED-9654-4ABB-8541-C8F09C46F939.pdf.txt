Long-term use of NSAIDs, especially aspirin, can have serious side
effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, the use of
COX-2–specific inhibitors for arthritic pains has been linked to an
increased risk of cardiovascular events (5, 6). Therefore,
alternative approaches are highly desirable to inhibit COXmediated cancer initiation or progression.
Among five primary prostanoids from the COX pathway of
arachidonic acid metabolism, prostaglandin E2 is reported to
promote tumor angiogenesis (7) and represents a novel angiogenic
switch in mammary cancer progression (8). Emerging evidences
suggest a possible involvement of another prostanoid, TxA2, in
tumor progression. TxA2 is a potent vasoconstrictor, mitogen, and
platelet activator (9–11). Increased thromboxane synthase expression and/or elevated levels of TxB2, the stable product of TxA2,
were found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (12), larynx squamous
cell carcinoma (13), and renal carcinoma (14). Previously, we
reported an increase in thromboxane synthase at mRNA level in
renal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, prostate cancer, and uterine
cancer when compared with their matched normal tissues in a
cancer profiling array (15). In prostate cancer, the expression
of thromboxane synthase was increased in tumor specimens of
advanced stage and grade and particularly in the areas of
perineural invasion (15, 16). Thromboxane synthase expressed in
prostate cancer cells was enzymatically active and may play a
contributory role in tumor progression, especially tumor cell
motility (15, 17, 18).
It is unknown, however, how thromboxane synthase affects
tumor migratory phenotype. Herein, we report that functional
TP(s), the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) for TxA2, is
expressed in prostate tumor cells as well as in tumor specimens.
Further, activation of this receptor by TxA2 mimetics has profound
effects on tumor cell cytoskeleton organization and causes
contraction through the small GTPase RhoA. Our studies suggest
that TxA2 and its cognate receptor(s) play a signaling role in tumor
progression associated with thromboxane synthase expression in
prostate cancer.

Abstract
Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) is a prostanoid formed by thromboxane synthase using the cyclooxygenase product prostaglandin
H2 as the substrate. Previously, increased expression of
thromboxane synthase was found in prostate tumors, and
tumor cell motility was attenuated by inhibitors of thromboxane synthase. This study was undertaken to elucidate how
tumor motility is regulated by TxA2. Here, we report that
human prostate cancer cells express functional receptors for
TxA2 (TP). Ligand binding assay found that PC-3 cells binded
to SQ29548, a high-affinity TP antagonist, in a saturable
manner with K d of 3.64 nmol/L and B max of 120.4 fmol per
million cells. Treatment of PC-3 cells by U46619, a TP agonist,
induced PC-3 cell contraction, which was blocked by
pretreatment with the TP antagonist SQ29548 or pinane
TxA2. The migration of prostate cancer cells was significantly
inhibited either by sustained activation of TP or by blockade
of TP activation, suggesting that TP activation must be tightly
controlled during cell migration. Further studies found that
small GTPase RhoA was activated by TP activation, and
pretreatment of PC-3 cells with Y27632, a Rho kinase (ROCK)
inhibitor, blocked U46619-induced cell contraction. A dominant-negative mutant of RhoA also blocked U46619-induced
cell contraction. Taken together, the data suggest that TPs are
expressed in prostate cancer and activation of TPs regulates
prostate cancer cell motility and cytoskeleton reorganization
through activation of Rho. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):115–21]

Introduction
Cyclooxygenases (COX) convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, which can give rise to various bioactive prostanoids via
different downstream isomerases. The second isoform of COX
(COX-2) is frequently up-regulated in various cancers, including
prostate cancer (1). Oncogenes such as ras or Her-2 stimulate
COX-2 expression (2), whereas tumor suppressors such as p53
down-regulate COX-2 expression (3). COX-2 has been a promising
target for prevention and treatment of cancer (4). However, there
are some caveats targeting COX-2 directly for cancer chemoprevention or treatment by using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAID), such as aspirin or COX-2–specific inhibitors.

Calbiochem. Rho activation assay kit was obtained from Pierce. Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against TP were kindly provided by Dr. Tai (University
of Kentucky, Lexington, KY) or purchased from Cayman Chemical or Santa
Cruz Biotechnology.

TP. Left, negative control; right, cells
stained with a polyclonal antibody
recognizing both isoforms of TP. Note the
predominant intracellular localization of TP
in PC-3 cells. C, Western blot analysis of
TP expression at protein level. Top, blot
probed with a polyclonal antibody against
both isoforms of TP. The annotation of TP
isoforms was determined by the molecular
weight. Bottom, loading control as revealed
by actin. D, densitometry analysis of
differential expression of TP isoforms in
prostate cancer cells. The density of TP
bands was quantified and normalized with
actin. Note that whereas PC-3 cells
express both TPa and TPh, DU145 cells
primarily express TPh.

Cells not incubated with the primary antibody but with the secondary
antibody were used as negative controls.
Western blot. PC-3 and DU145 cells were grown to 90% confluence on
10-cm dishes and collected with ice-cold complete radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.0% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0)] containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation.
Protein concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid protein assay
kit (Pierce). Protein samples (30 Ag) were mixed with 6 SDS sample buffer
and subjected to electrophoresis in 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to
0.45 Am of polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After transfer, the
membrane was blocked with TBS containing 5% low fat milk for 60 min
and then incubated with the primary antibody against TP receptor (Cayman
Chemical) at the dilution of 1:1,000 in TBS-Tween 20 with 5% low fat milk at
4jC overnight. The membrane was washed (thrice) with TBS-Tween 20
(0.1%) and probed with goat anti-rabbit fluorescently labeled secondary
antibody (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature and washed (thrice) with
TBS-Tween 20 for a total of 15 min. The immunoblots were visualized and
the target bands were quantified by IR imaging system (Odyssey).
Determination of the TxA2 receptor binding sites. PC-3 cells were
seeded in 24-multiwell plates at a density of 1.5  105 per well. When the
cells reached confluence, the binding test was performed. The binding
buffer was prepared by combining 9 volumes of modified HEPES-Tyrode’s
buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES, 129 mmol/L NaCl, 2.8 mmol/L KCl, 8.9 mmol/L
NaHCO3, 1.8 mmol/L KH2PO4, 0.8 mmol/L MgCl2, 5.6 mmol/L dextrose,

Immunohistochemistry. For tissue immunostaining for TP expression,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections or tissue arrays were deparaffinized,
rehydrated, and antigen retrieved by placing in Declere working solution
(Cell Marque) in an electric pressure cooker for 15 min. After a hot rinse
with boiling Declere, slides were cooled for 5 min. After washing in
deionized water, slides were processed for immunohistochemical staining
using a Zymed Histostain-SP kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in RPMI
1640-10% FBS overnight and changed into serum-free medium. Cells were
fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature,
washed, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for
30 min at room temperature. For immunostaining for TPs or other proteins,
antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA in PBS, added onto cell monolayers, and
incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS-1% BSA
thrice, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated or Alexa Fluor
568–conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room
temperature. After staining, the cells on coverslips were washed and
mounted with Gold antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen).
For live cell staining, cells cultured on cover glass were blocked with 3%
BSA for 20 min and then incubated with primary antibody raised against
the first 120 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of TP (H-120, 1:25; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for 45 min at 4jC. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells
were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody. The
staining was immediately examined under an epifluorescence microscope.

1 mmol/L CaCl2 (with pH adjusted to 7.4)] and 1 volume of 3.8% sodium
citrate. The confluent PC-3 cells in the 24-well plate were washed twice with
the binding buffer. Then, the cells were treated with 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10,
and 20 nmol/L of the TxA2 receptor antagonist [3H]SQ29548 at room
temperature for total binding samples. [3H]SQ29548 plus unlabeled SQ29548
(10 Amol/L) were coincubated in the nonspecific binding samples. After
30 min, the labeled buffer was removed, and the cells were quickly rinsed
thrice with 2 mL of washing buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.38%
sodium citrate]. The cell layer was then solubilized with 0.5 mL of 2% SDS
and transferred to scintillation vial with 2.5 mL of scintillation liquid
(EcoLite, ICN) to measure the bound radioactivities. Specific bindings were
obtained by subtracting the nonspecific bindings from the total bindings.
The binding data were analyzed using Prism 4 software to obtain K d and
B max (GraphPad Software).
Cell contraction assay. PC-3 cells were plated at 2  105 per well in sixwell culture dishes in serum-free medium. Twenty-four hours after plating,
the cells were treated with U46619 or IBOP (300 nmol/L) or vehicle solvent
(ethanol) for durations indicated, with or without 15-min pretreatment with
TP antagonists, such as SQ29548 (10 Amol/L) or pinane TxA2 (PTA2;
10 Amol/L), or other inhibitors of downstream effectors as described in the
text. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room
temperature and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted
fluorescence microscope connected to a Sony DKC5000 digital camera.
Occasionally, cells were stained with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanatephalloidin (TRITC)-phalloidin. Cells displaying rounded morphology with
length less than twice the width were counted. A minimum of 300 cells was
scored in a double-blind approach.
Rhotekin pull-down assay for RhoA activation. Ten million PC-3 cells
were plated out in serum-free medium in a 10-cm culture dish and, after
overnight culture, treated with graded levels of U46619, with or without
pretreatment of SQ29548 to block the activation of TP by U46619. At
different time intervals, cells were rapidly lysed on ice and processed for
Rhotekin pull-down assay for the levels of GTP-bound RhoA according to
the instruction from the manufacturer (Pierce).
Transient transfection of RhoA expression constructs. PC-3 cells
(2  105) were plated on cover glass in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and then
cotransfected with equal amounts of pEGFP-C2 and one of RhoA allelic
constructs (Millipore). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were
cultured in serum-free medium overnight and treated with 300 nmol/L
U46619 or vehicle control for 15 min. The cells were then fixed in 3%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min and stained with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma).
The cover glasses were then mounted on a slide and observed under
epifluorescence microscopy. The contraction of transfected cells, as
indicated by green fluorescent protein, was analyzed.
Cell migration assay. Modified Boyden chamber assay was used to
assess the effects of TP activation or inhibition on prostate cancer cell
migration essentially as previously described (15). Briefly, both sides of
membrane were coated with 10 Ag/mL fibronectin for 2 h. After rinsing,
0.5  106 prostate cancer cells in 0.5 mL serum-free RPMI 1640 were placed
on the top chamber. After the cells settled (1 h), 1 mL RPMI 1640 with
compounds for treatment was added to the bottom chamber. The migration
was terminated after 6 h, and the cells at the top chamber were removed by
cotton swabs. The membranes were fixed, stained, and mounted for
enumeration of cells migrated to the underside of membrane. At least six
fields were counted in a double-blind approach.
Statistical analysis. Student’s t test (two tailed) was used to analyze the
difference between two groups. For comparisons among three or more
groups, ANOVA test was used. The statistical tests were performed using
GraphPad Prism 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software). A P value, if <0.05,
is considered statistically significant.

(15). The arachidonate product of thromboxane synthase, TxA2, can
elicit cellular signaling through its cognate GPCRs (TP). To study
whether TP is involved in prostate cancer progression, we first
evaluated the expression of TP at protein level in normal and
cancerous human prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry.
Tissue slides were stained with rabbit anti-TP antibody. As shown
in Fig. 1A, the benign gland (left) showed weak cytoplasmic staining
for TP (the stain on luminal surface is likely artifact), whereas the
neoplastic glands from the same patient showed strong cytoplasmic
staining for TP (right). The clinical relevance of TP expression is
also supported by the observations that increased TP expression
was associated with extracapsular extension and invasion of the
seminal vesicles by prostate tumors (16).
Next, we determined the expression of TPs in human prostate
carcinoma cells by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1B, TPs
were mainly localized in the perinuclear region of the cytosol of
PC-3 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of both
TPa and TPh isoforms in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1C). The level of total TP
proteins in DU145 cells (6.3) was approximately a half of those in
PC-3 cells (12.07). Further, in PC-3 cells, TPa constituted 28% of

morphology. On treatment with U46619 (300 nmol/L), an agonist
of TP (21–23), cells contracted and presented a ‘‘round’’ shape
within 5 to 15 min (Fig. 3A). Similar results were also obtained with
another TP agonist, IBOP (data not shown; refs. 24, 25). To study
whether the induction of cell contraction by U46619 was mediated
by TP receptors, we pretreated PC-3 cells with SQ29548 (10 Amol/L)
or PTA2 (10 Amol/L), two TxA2 receptor antagonists that have

total TP proteins. In contrast, TPa accounted for only 7% of total
TP proteins in DU145 cells (Fig. 1D).
Surface expression and ligand binding activities of TPs
expressed in prostate cancer. The predominant localization of TP
in the cytosol of prostate cancer cells led us to examine whether a
subset of TPs is expressed at cell surface. A polyclonal antibody
raised against the NH2-terminal 120-amino acid residues of TP was
used to stain live, nonpermeabilized cells. As shown in Fig. 2A,
PC-3 and, to a less extent, DU145 cells had positivity of staining at
cell surface, suggesting that a subset of TPs could be localized at
plasma membrane.
To examine the functionality of TPs expressed, ligand binding
assays were performed using SQ29548, a high-affinity antagonist
of TP (19). Confluent PC-3 or DU145 cells in the 24-well plates were
treated with [3H]SQ29548 alone ( for total binding) or with
[3H]SQ29548 plus excess unlabeled SQ29548 ( for nonspecific
binding). The specific binding was obtained by subtracting
nonspecific binding from total binding. As shown in Fig. 2B, live
PC-3 cells can bind SQ29548 in a saturable manner, suggesting the
presence of receptors on cell surface. Nonlinear regression analysis
of the specific binding data revealed that PC-3 cells bind to
SQ29548 with B max of 120.4 fmol per million cells and K d of 3.641
nmol/L. The B max and K d of DU145 cells toward SQ29548 were
51.47 fmol per million cells and 8.06 nmol/L, respectively. The
lower B max of DU145 cells, when compared with that of PC-3 cells,
is consistent with the pattern of TP expression at protein levels
(Fig. 1C and D) and TP localization at cell surface (Fig. 2A).
Taken together, the data suggest that at least a subset of TPs is
expressed at the cell surface and further prostate cancer cells bind
to TP ligand in a specific and saturable manner. Interestingly, the
K d values of PC-3 and DU145 cells are slightly lower than the K d
values of SQ29548 for TPa (12.4 nmol/L) and for TPh (10 nmol/L;
ref. 20). Both isoforms are expressed in PC-3 cells, whereas in
DU145 cells TPh is predominantly expressed. Further studies are
needed to determine whether the increased affinity of TP(s)
expressed in prostate cancer cells is due to mutations/variations in
primary sequences and/or to potential alterations in their binding
partners that may lead to alterations in its affinity toward agonists
or antagonists, such as SQ29548.

contraction. Cells were transfected with the constructs as indicated and then treated with 300 nmol/L U46619. *, P < 0.05, when compared with its respective vehicle
controls (ethanol). Note the abolishing of U46619-induced cell contraction by either constitutively active RhoA (Rho-Act ) or dominant-negative RhoA (Rho-DN ) but
not the wild-type RhoA (Rho-WT ).

(300 nmol/L or 3 Amol/L), the migration of PC-3 cells was
significantly compromised. In DU145 cells, the effects of U46619
were modest; only at high concentration (3 Amol/L), U46619 had
significant inhibition on cell migration (Fig. 4A). Interestingly,
blockade of TP activation with SQ29548 or PTA2 also significantly
reduced PC-3 migration (Fig. 4B), suggesting that TP activation is
required for PC-3 cell motility.
Taken together, the data suggest that TP activation has to be
controlled in a spatial and temporal manner in its regulation of cell
migration. On one hand, blockade of TP activation with SQ29548 or
PTA2 was found inhibitory for cell migration, suggesting that TP
activation is required for tumor cells (PC-3) to migrate. On the
other hand, sustained activation of TP with high levels of U46619
significantly compromised tumor cell motility. Further studies are
required to determine when and how TP is activated in a temporal
and spatial manner facilitative for cell migration and whether TP
activation requires endogenous synthesis of TxA2 or other
TP ligands, such as prostaglandin H2.
Activation of RhoA by TxA2-TP signaling. As a GPCR, TP
activation can elicit a multitude of signaling cascades, including

higher affinity to TPs than U46619 does (19, 26). As shown in
Fig. 3B, SQ29548 and PTA2 blocked the induction of PC-3 cell
contraction by U46619. The blockade of U46619-induced cell
contraction by TP antagonists suggests that TxA2 mimetic U46619
induces cell contraction through TP receptors and that the
induction of cell contraction by U46619 can be blocked by highaffinity antagonists of TPs, such as SQ29548. The data also suggest
that TP(s) expressed in prostate cancer cells is able to transduce
extracellular signals to the inside of the cells.
Regulation of tumor cell motility by TxA2-TP signaling. Cell
contraction is an integral part of cell migration. During the
migratory process, cells form lamellipodia or filopodia at the
leading edge to charter cells forward. At the trailing edge,
however, cells must detach and retract to enable cells to move
forward (27). To study whether cell contraction, mediated by
TxA2-TP, has effects on prostate cancer cell migration, the effects
of U46619 and SQ29548 on PC-3 cell migration were examined
using the modified Boyden chamber assay. As shown in Fig. 4A,
U46619 stimulated the migration of PC-3 cells at very low
concentration (30 nmol/L). However, at higher concentration

the activation of phospholipase C, mobilization of Ca2+, phosphorylation of p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK), formation of cyclic AMP, and activation of protein kinase
G, C, and A (28). We examined the involvement of different
effectors of TP activation in cell contraction induced by U46619
using various pharmacologic inhibitors. It was found that the
activities of p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, protein kinase G
(Fig. 5A), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or pertussis toxin-sensitive
Gi subunit were not required for U46619 to induce cell contraction
(data not shown). The screening revealed that Y27632 (10 Amol/L),
a Rho kinase inhibitor (29), was able to block U46619-induced
contraction in PC-3 cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting a possible
involvement of small GTPase RhoA in cell contraction induced
by TP activation.
To elucidate whether RhoA participates in TxA2 cellular
signaling, we studied whether activation of TP can lead to the
activation of RhoA. As shown in Fig. 5B, U46619 treatment
stimulated the activation of RhoA as shown by Rhotekin pull-down
assay. This activation was attenuated by pretreatment of cells with
SQ29548, a high-affinity antagonist for TPs. The data suggest that
U46619 stimulated the activation of RhoA through TxA2 receptor
activation.
To further confirm the involvement of RhoA in U46619induced cell contraction, we evaluated the effects of ectopic
expression of RhoA or its mutants on U46619-induced cell
contraction. As shown in Fig. 5C and D, the constitutively active
mutant of RhoA was sufficient to cause cell contraction, whereas
the dominant-negative mutant of RhoA blocked cell contraction
induced by U46619. The data affirm that activation of RhoA is
required for TxA2-TP to induce cell contraction and that RhoA
may serve as intermediary for TxA2-TP signaling axis to regulate
tumor cell motility.
Rho GTPases, which include RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac, are critical
for the dynamic changes in cell shape and adhesions that drive
migration (30–33). During the highly coordinated process of
migration, cells form lamellipodia or filopodia at the leading edge

to charter cells forward (27). At the trailing edge, however, cells
must detach and retract to enable cells to move forward (27).
Cdc42 is required for cell polarity and filopodial protrusions,
whereas Rac1 promotes lamellipodial protrusions. The contraction
at the trailing edge is mediated by the small GTPase RhoA (27).
Recently, it has been shown that RhoA was activated by GPCR
signaling, including those elicited by U46619, through G12
heterotrimeric G proteins during invasion of cancer cells, including
PC-3 (34, 35). Our study suggests that TP can regulate cell
migration and cytoskeleton reorganization through inducing
cell contraction via activating RhoA.
In summary, the present study reports that functional receptors
for TxA2 were expressed in prostate cancer cells. Activation of TP
by receptor agonists, such as U46619, caused profound reorganization in cytoskeleton and induced cell contraction. Cell motility
was significantly inhibited either by sustained activation of TP with
high concentrations of U46619 or by blockade of TP activation with
SQ29548. Further studies found that RhoA was activated by U46619
through TP activation, which was required for U46619 to induce
cell contraction. The present study suggests that TxA2-TP signaling
axis may regulate cell migration through elaborating Rho activation
and cytoskeleton reorganization. Further studies are required,
however, to determine how TxA2-TP signaling is activated and
regulated in a temporal and spatial manner optimal for cell
migration and whether the TxA2-TP signaling axis can be
intervened to impede the invasion and metastasis of prostate
carcinoma cells.
