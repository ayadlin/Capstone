Abstract
Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors broadly used for the control of hypercholesterolemia.
Recently, they are reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. In this study, we show that statins inhibited
the histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and increased the
accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 and the expression of
p21WAF/CIP in human cancer cells. Computational modeling
showed the direct interaction of the carboxylic acid moiety of
statins with the catalytic site of HDAC2. In the subsequent
enzymatic assay, it was shown that lovastatin inhibited HDAC2
activity competitively with a K i value of 31.6 Mmol/L. Sp1 but
not p53 sites were found to be the statins-responsive element
shown by p21 luciferase-promoter assays. DNA affinity protein
binding assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
showed the dissociation of HDAC1/2 and association of CBP,
leading to the histone-H3 acetylation on the Sp1 sites of p21
promoter. In vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth
were both inhibited by statins. These results suggest a novel
mechanism for statins through abrogation of the HDAC
activity and promoter histone-H3 acetylation to regulate p21
expression. Therefore, statins might serve as novel HDAC
inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention. [Cancer

Introduction
Statins can reduce serum cholesterol levels by competitively
inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase,
the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of mevalonate (the fatty
acid intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis). This effect contributes to their decrease in the incidence of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disorders and their remarkable prevention of
cardiovascular disease (CVD; ref. 1). By inhibiting the biosynthesis
of mevalonate, statins also inhibit the formation of downstream
lipid isoprenoid intermediates, such as farnesyl PPi (FPP) and
geranylgeranyl PPi (GGPP). The isoprenoids are lipid moieties that
are added to various proteins, including Ras, Rho, and Rac of small
G proteins during posttranslational modification (prenylation), and
anchor these proteins to the cell membrane (2). Statins have an
established record of human safety and efficacy in CVD prevention
and also show promise for cancer prevention in observational,

preclinical, and certain aspects of randomized controlled studies
(3). These studies have focused primarily on the malignancy of
colorectal, breast, prostate, and melanocyte and indicate that
statins are one of the most promising classes of agents currently
available for testing in cancer prevention. Statins have been reported
to inhibit proliferation by down-regulating CDK2 activity or
up-regulating p21 expression. Simvastatin inhibited high glucose–
induced mesangial cell proliferation through preventing geranylgeranylation of Rho GTPase by reversing p21 down-regulation (4).
However, transcriptional regulation of p21 expression in a p53independent manner by lovastatin has also been reported (5).
Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism will help
develop selective-targeting approaches for statins to prevent cancer
and several other aging-related diseases ( for example, neurodegenerative disorders; ref. 3).
The acetylation of lysine residues on histones H3 and H4
represent the active or open state of chromatin, which allow
various transcription factors access to the promoters of target
genes. In contrast, deacetylation of lysine residues results in
chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression (6). This
posttranslational modification is maintained by a dynamic balance
between the activities of histone acetyltransferases and histone
deacetylases (HDAC). Human tumors are frequently characterized
with an overall loss of acetylation at histone that is considered as
universal epigenetic markers for malignant transformation (7).
Overexpression of HDACs is observed in human cancer tissues
from a range of organs, such as stomach, colon, and breast (8).
Most studies to date have focused on the aberrant recruitment of
HDACs to promoters through physical association with oncogenic
DNA-binding fusion proteins. For example, the oncogenic PMLRARa, PLZF-RARa, and AML1-ETO fusion proteins recruit HDACcontaining repressor complexes to repress the genes required for
myeloid differentiation, thus induce acute promyelocytic leukemia
and acute myeloid leukemia (9). Yet, the exact mechanism of how
HDACs are recruited to functional genes is still unknown.
Nevertheless, restoration of a ‘‘normal’’ epigenetic state by HDAC
inhibitors could be a promising approach for cancer therapy (7).
The HDAC inhibitors are categorized into four groups: shortchain fatty acids, hydroxamic acids, cyclic tetrapeptides, and
benzamides (8). Among them, trichostatin A (TSA), butyrate,
vaproic acid (VPA), and MS275 have been shown to induce the
expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p21, to
activate the death receptor–mediated apoptotic pathway and to
change the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and
metastasis (10). TSA and suberoylanalide hydroxamic acid (SAHA),
the most potent HDAC inhibitors, both contain hydroxamic acid
functional group. Statins in acid form possessing a carboxylic acid–
containing long chain have a very similar structure to TSA and
SAHA (Supplementary Fig. S1), and we found that statins induce
hyperacetylation of H3. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that

statins act as HDAC inhibitors. Molecular modeling supported this
notion that the carboxylic acid moiety of lovastatin chelated the
catalytic site of the human HDAC2, similar to the way that TSA
does. Our in vitro experiments revealed that statins indeed inhibit
the HDAC activity and increase the histone acetylation in human
cancer cells. Furthermore, statins induced p21 expression through
dissociation of HDAC1/2 and association of CBP, leading to histone
acetylation on the Sp1 sites of p21 promoter. Both in vitro cell
proliferation and in vivo xenograft model showed the antitumor
activity of statins. These findings show a novel function of statins
and provide a new thought for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Lovastatin was from Lotus Pharmaceutical Co. Atovastatin,
pravastatin, and simvastatin were obtained from Synpac Kingdom
Pharmaceutical Co. Fluvastatin was a gift from Novartis. TSA and VPA
were obtained from Sigma. The human wild-type p21 promoter-luciferase
fusion plasmid pWWP-Luc and a serial of plasmids of mutant Sp1 were
kindly donated by Dr. T Sakai (University of Tokyo). The antibodies specific
for p21, p53, HDAC1, HDAC3, and h-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti–Ac-histone H3, HDAC2, and Sp1 antibodies were
obtained from Upstate.
Cell culture. A549 human lung carcinoma cells from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and HCT-116, HCT-116 p53 / human colon
carcinoma cells ( from Van Dyke MW, M.D. Anderson) were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; NCI-H292 human lung
carcinoma cells and AGS human gastric carcinoma cells from ATCC were
maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS.
HDAC activity assay. The HDAC activity was determined using the
Fluor-de-Lys HDAC activity assay kit (Biomol). Incubations were performed
at 37jC with cell extracts, statins, or TSA, and HDAC reaction was initiated
by the addition of Fluor-de-Lys substrate. After adequate minutes, Fluorde-Lys Developer was added, and the mixture was incubated for another
10 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured using a
fluorimetric reader with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm.
The HDAC activity was expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units. For HDAC2
enzymatic assay, HDAC2 recombinant protein was incubated with adequate
concentration of acetylated substrate in assay buffer containing or lacking
lovastatin. The K i values for the test compounds were calculated from
Lineweaver-Burk plots.
Immunoprecipitation. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by
using antibodies against HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3. Immune complexes
were then incubated with proteinase A/G agarose beads for 1 h. All
immunoprecipitates were washed thrice with PBS buffer before the HDAC
activity assay.
Homology modeling. The sequence alignment between human HDAC2
and histone deacetylase-like protein (HDLP) was determined by the
multiple sequence alignment between human class I HDACs (HDAC1,
HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8) and HDLP (11). The crystal water molecules
within 30 Å from the center of mass of protein and the cocrystalized
inhibitor of HDLP, TSA, were included in the template structure. The
homology models generated were optimized by molecular dynamics
module implemented in MODELLER 9.1 (12). The one with the lowest
energy score was chosen as the final model, and then its quality was further
checked with PROCHECK (13, 14).
Assignment of protonation states and partial charges. For the
HDAC2 homology model, the hydrogen atoms were added by PDB2PQR
(15) and the protonation states of residues around active site were carefully inspected (16). The histidine residues 141 and 142 were assigned to
HID, and the histidine residue 179 was assigned to HIE. The aspartic acid
residues 175, 177, 182, and 265 were assigned to be deprotonated, whereas
the tyrosine residue 304 was set to be protonated. The ligand atomic
charges were calculated by Gaussian98 program (Gaussian, Inc.) at the
HF/6-31G* level and then fitted by the RESP method. The atomic charges

on protein were generated by LEaP module of the AMBER 9.0 suite
AMBER 9 (University of California-San Francisco).
Molecular docking. The docking simulations were performed by both
AutoDock 3.0.5 (17) and MEDock (18). The grid center was set at the center
of the protein, and the grid box size was set to 90  90  90 points with a
grid spacing of 0.375 Å. The gird box was set to be large enough to include
the entire active site. The rotatable bonds of ligands were checked manually,
and the ones without resonance were allowed to rotate. The charges of
nonpolar hydrogens in the ligands were merged to the charge of carbons
that they attached. The charge of zinc was set to +2, and its van der Waals
variables were taken from Stote et al. (19). In the docking simulation, 100
runs were performed for AutoDock and MEDock. The Lamarckian genetic
algorithm implemented in AutoDock was used for searching the global
minimum, whereas a novel information theory–based evolutionary
algorithm was implemented in MEDock as the search algorithm. The
maximum number of energy evaluations and maximum number of
generation were set to 107 and 2.5  104, respectively. The other docking
variables were set as default values.
Western blot analysis. After treatment with statins, total cell lysates or
nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE using adequate
percentage polyacrylamide gels.
Reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA was isolated from A549 cell
using Trizol reagent (Life Technology). Reverse transcription reaction was
performed using 2 Ag of total RNA, reverse transcribed into cDNA using
oligo dT primer, and then amplified 30 cycles using two oligonucleotide
primers derived from published p21 or h-actin sequence, including5¶CAGAGGAGGCGCCATGTCAG-3¶ and 5¶-CCTGTGGGCGGATTAGG G-3¶
(p21) or 5¶-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3¶ and 5¶-CTAGA
AGCATTTGCGGGGACGATGGAGGG-3¶ (h-actin). The PCR products were
subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.
RNA protease assay. Total RNA was extracted from A549 cells with
statins treatment by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A RiboQuant multiprobe RNase protection assay (RPA) was performed with the hCC-2 biotin
label probe set containing p130, Rb, p107, p53, p57, p27, p21, p19, p18, p16,
p14/15, L32, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; BD
PharMingen). The probes were hybridized with 10 Ag of RNA isolated from
A549 cells. Samples were then digested with RNase to remove singlestranded RNA. Remaining probes were resolved on denaturing 5%
polyacrylamide gels.
Transient transfection and luciferase activity assay. The vectors
(pWWP and its serial mutant plasmids) were transiently transfected
into A549 cells with Arrestin transfection reagent. Briefly, 2 Ag of
plasmid DNA, 1 Ag of h-gal, and 3 AL transfection reagents were mixed,
and the transfection protocol was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Six hours after transfection, the cells
were cultured in normal complete medium for another 16 h. The transfected
cells with or without statin treatment were subjected to luciferase assay.
Luciferase activities were normalized with the amount of protein in cell
lysates.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) analysis was performed as described (20). Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified, resuspended in H2O, and subjected to PCR. To
amplify the regions p21 promoter, PCR was performed with the following
pairs of primers: 5¶-ACCAACGCAGGCGAGGGACT-3¶ and 5¶-CCGGCTCCACAA GGAACTGA-3¶. PCR products were then resolved by 1.5% agaroseethidium bromide gel electrophoresis and visualized by UV.
DNA affinity protein binding assay. Oligonucleotides corresponding to
the consensus sequences of Sp1 (5¶-AGC TTGGAAATTCCGGA-3¶) and (5¶TTCCGGAATTTCCAAGCT-3¶) of the human p21 promoter were synthesized, annealed, and end labeled with biotin.
Cell proliferation. For growth inhibition analysis, A549 cells were
seeded at density of 1  105 cells per well in six-well dishes. A solution
containing various statins or TSA in DMSO was added in each dish after the
seeding. The number of viable cells was counted for 3 d.
Flow cytometry. Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry using a
propidium iodide stain buffer and analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur cytometer
with Cellquest software.

Animal xenograft assay. Female BALB/c nude mice (4–6 wk old) were
injected with 107 A549 cells (suspended in 0.1 mL PBS and mixed with
0.1 mL Matrigel) in the rear left flank. Two weeks after administration,
100 to 200 mm3 tumors were apparent on all mice. At this time, animals
were divided into two groups (n = 6) and orally received either control
vehicle (soy oil) or lovastatin (20 mg/kg/d) suspended in soy oil. Mice were
treated everyday for 30 d with lovastatin or control vehicle, and tumor
growth was measured twice per week with calipers. Tumor volume (V ) was
calculated using the formula, V (mm3) = 0.52(ab 2), where a is length and
b is width of the tumor (20).

0.53 nmol/L) near the active site (Fig. 2B), whereas in the other
binding mode, lovastatin extends its long chain into the active site
(with a predicted K i value of 7.65 nmol/L) with the carboxylate
group coordinating with zinc (Fig. 2C).

Results
Statins inhibit HDAC activity and induce histone acetylation. A number of structurally diverse natural and synthetic
compounds, such as TSA and SAHA, have been reported as HDAC
inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S1A). These compounds consist of a
hydrophobic scaffold (benzyl group) with a spacer (aliphatic group)
attaching to a functional group (hydroxamic acid) which can
interact with zinc ion in the active site pocket (8, 10). Statins in
acid form (open ring) possess a carboxylic acid–containing
aliphatic group similar to the structure of TSA and SAHA
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). To determine whether statins can
inhibit HDAC, computational modeling of the HDAC2-statins
interactions was conducted and the changes of HDAC activity
caused by statins were examined in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1A,
various statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and
atorvastatin) at 10 Amol/L inhibited the activity of HDACs in A549
nuclear extracts; TSA was a positive control. The dose-dependent
inhibition of HDAC activity by lovastatin was seen (Supplementary
Fig. S2). To assess whether HDAC inhibition by statins indeed leads
to increase in histone acetylation, the level of acetylated histone-H3
was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1B, acetylated histone-H3 was
increased after treatment with 30 Amol/L statins. To compare the
effect of lovastatin with TSA and VPA, different concentrations of
TSA or VPA or 30 Amol/L lovastatin were used. The accumulation
of global acetylated histone-H3 was seen after treatment with TSA
from 0.125 to 1 Amol/L or VPA from 1 to 5 mmol/L. There is a
dramatic increase of acetylated histone-H3 by TSA from 0.5 to
1 Amol/L (Fig. 1C). The extent of histone-H3 acetylation induced
by 30 Amol/L lovastatin is comparable with that of 0.5 Amol/L TSA
or 5 mmol/L VPA. To test whether statins affect the protein level of
HDAC, the expression of class I HDACs was examined. The protein
levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 were not changed after
statins or TSA treatment (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that inhibition of
HDAC activity, but not HDAC expression, is responsible for the
accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 after statins treatment.
Computational modeling of the interaction between lovastatin and human HDAC2. To consolidate the hypothesis whether
there are substantial interactions between lovastatin and HDAC2,
homology modeling and docking simulations were conducted.
Docking of TSA into the HDAC2 homology model was first
performed as a control. As shown in Fig. 2A, TSA inserted its long
aliphatic chain into the tube-like pocket of HDAC2 and interacted
with the zinc ion and active site residues of HDAC2 through its
hydroxamic acid at one end of the aliphatic chain. This binding
mode follows very similar pattern to the interaction of TSA and a
bacterial HDLP (21). In the docking of lovastatin, two major binding
modes were observed. In one binding mode, lovastatin was able to
bind HDAC2 at an adjacent pocket (with a predicted K i value of

Inhibition of HDAC activity by lovastatin. To gain a better
understanding of lovastatin on HDAC inhibition, the kinetic
variables (K m and K i values) were calculated according to the
Lineweaver-Burk plot (1/m versus 1/[substrate]). As shown in
Fig. 3A, K m value was 57.6 Amol/L and K i value was 31.6 Amol/L.
The Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that all the lines intersect at the
same point on the 1/m axis in the absence or presence of lovastatin,
demonstrating a competitive inhibition of lovastatin on HDAC2.
The K m value for TSA was 128 Amol/L, and the K i value was
0.3 nmol/L (data not shown). Because HDAC inhibitors might
display distinct selectivity against different isoenzymes, which
isoform was inhibited by statins was further examined. HDAC1,
HDAC2, or HDAC3 was immunoprecipitated, and lovastatin showed
the inhibition on these isoforms (Fig. 3B). To examine whether
statins are broad HDAC inhibitors, cell lysates from several cancer
cell lines, including lung cells A549 and NCI, gastric cells AGS, and
colon cells HCT116, were used to measure the HDAC activity.
Lovastatin at 30 Amol/L inhibited HDAC activity in all malignant
cells (Fig. 3C) but had no effect on benign human umbilical vascular
endothelial cell (data not shown).

Stains increased the protein and mRNA expressions of p21.
Hyperacetylation of histones by HDAC inhibitors have been
reported to activate tumor suppressor genes and repress oncogenes (8). To investigate the biological events aroused by statins,
expression of cell cycle–related genes was examined by RPA.
Statins and TSA increased p21 mRNA expression without increase
in p53 mRNA (Fig. 4A). The increase in p21 mRNA was confirmed
by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting
(Fig. 4B and C, top). A dose-dependent increase of p21 expression
by TSA and VPA was seen (Fig. 4C, middle and bottom). The p21
induction by 0.5 Amol/L TSA is comparable with that by 1 Amol/L,
although the extent of global histone-H3 acetylation is dramatically
increased at 1 Amol/L (Fig. 4C, middle and Fig. 1C, top). The
promoter activity using wild-type p21 promoter-luciferase plasmid
(WWP-Luc) was also activated by statins and TSA (Fig. 4D).
Analysis of the statins responsive elements on the p21
promoter. To identify which of the cis-acting element is
responsible for the statins-induced p21 expression, a series of p21
promoter-luciferase reporters were used, including the 2,326-bp
full-length (pWWP), truncated (pWWP-delp53), and mutant forms

(pWP101-mtSp1-3, pWP101-mtSp1-4, and pWP101-mtSp1-5,6;
Fig. 5A). The induction of p21 promoter activity by lovastatin or
TSA was observed. Deletion of p53 had no effect on the lovastatininduced or TSA-induced p21 promoter activity. By comparing the
pWP101-mtSp1-3, pWP101-mtSp1-4, or pWP101-mtSp1-5,6 with
pWWP, it was clear that promoter activity was strongly diminished
when Sp1-3, Sp1-4, or Sp1-5,6 site was mutated. The statinsinduced p21 expression was seen in both HCT116 wild-type and
p53 / cells (Fig. 5B), and p53 expression was not affected by
statins (data not shown).
The interaction between HDAC and Sp1/Sp3 after treatment
with statins. Because Sp1 elements are important for statininduced p21 expression, DNA affinity protein binding assay (DAPA)
using biotin-labeled oligonucleotides covering Sp1-3 to Sp1-6 sites
on p21 promoter was performed. Sp1 and Sp3 were both bound to
Sp1 sites. However, the occupancy of Sp1 or Sp3 on the p21
promoter did not change after treatment with lovastatin or TSA.
HDAC1 and HDAC2 were also bound to Sp1 sites in the basal state;
however, these bindings disappeared or decreased after treatment
with lovastatin or TSA (Fig. 5C, lanes 2 and 3). To examine the
in vivo binding of Sp1, HDAC1, and HDAC2 to the p21 promoter,
ChIP assay was performed. Consistent with the results of DAPA,
the in vivo binding of Sp1 was not changed by lovastatin or TSA.
However, dissociation of HDAC1/2 and association of CBP to the
p21 promoter covering Sp1 sites were seen after treatment with
lovastatin or TSA (Fig. 5D). To investigate whether the release of
HDAC1/2 and recruitment of CBP increased histone acetylation on
the p21 promoter, the binding of acetylated histone-H3 was further
examined. The increased binding of histone-H3 acetylation to
the p21 promoter was seen in the presence of lovastatin or TSA
(Fig. 5D). These results showed that lovastatin induced release of
the bound HDAC1/2 from the histone-DNA complex at Sp1 sites on
the p21 promoter.
Statins inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth of
lung cancer xenograft. To investigate the anticancer potential of
statins, in vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth were
evaluated. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay examines the growth of cancer cells, and
flow cytometry analyzes the cell cycle progression. Cell growth
was inhibited by statins or TSA (Fig. 6A). The percentage of
G0-G1 phase was increased in cells treated with statins, suggesting
the arrest at G1 phase (Fig. 6B). The in vivo tumor growth was
assessed by xenograft model using nude mice, and mice had a
smaller tumor volume and tumor weight after p.o. administration of
lovastatin (20 mg/kg/d) for 45 days (Fig. 6C and D). The expression
of p21 protein and histone-H3 acetylation in the excised tumors
was also examined and was elevated from lovastatin-treated mice
(Fig. 6D).

showed the effectiveness of statins to inhibit cell proliferation, cell
cycle progression, and tumor formation. These results are
encouraging and strengthen the concept that statins are promising
agent for cancer therapy and prevention.
Inhibiting the biosynthesis of mevalonate, statins reduce the
formation of FPP and GGPP. Posttranslational prenylation of Ras
by FPP or Rho by GGPP is essential for the translocation of these
small G proteins from membrane to cytosol (23). Blockage of Rho is
generally thought as the anticancer effect of statins. However, there
are many evidences showing that nonlipid effect plays an
important role in their anticancer activity (24, 25). To explore the

Discussion
Epidemiologic data have shown the correlation between statins
and a decrease in cancer incidence. The anticancer effect of statins
has attributed to the increase in apoptosis, the suppression of
angiogenesis, and the alteration of invasion and metastatic
potential (22). However, exact mechanism of their anticancer effect
remains to be defined. In this study, we found statins inhibit the
HDAC activity, resulting in the increase of global histone-H3
acetylation. Moreover, statins elicit p21 expression and histone-H3
acetylation on the p21 promoter by shifting the promoter
occupancy from HDAC to CBP. In vitro and in vivo studies also

whole picture, we performed RPA to analyze the cell cycle–related
genes and found that statins increased p21. RT-PCR and Western
blot confirmed this up-regulation of p21. The role of HMG-CoA
reductase is ruled out because mevalonate pretreatment cannot
prevent p21 induction (data not shown).
A variety of transcription factors, such as p53, Sp1/Sp3, C/EBPa,
and C/EBPh, have been reported to be critical for the p21
transcription in response to different stimulus. C/EBPa is required
for the dexamethasone-induced transactivation of the p21 promoter. Antioxidants induce p21 expression through C/EBPh and
sensitize the colon cancer cells to chemotherapy (26, 27). Foremost,
p53 was considered as the most important regulator of p21 because
there are two important p53-binding sites on the p21 promoter (28).
The p21 transcription induced by some chemotherapeutic drugs or
DNA damage has been reported to be p53 dependent (29, 30). IKK
inhibitors a-methylene-g-butyrolactone compounds can also induce p21 expression through up-regulation and acetylation of p53
(31).5 In contrast, statins-induced p21 expression is irrelevant to

p53, because promoter luciferase activity was not affected by p53
deletion and induction of p21 was still seen in HCT 116 p53 / cells.
RPA results also showed no increase in p53 mRNA after statins
treatment. The p53-independent induction of p21 expression is
meaningful for the therapeutic value of statins, as loss or mutation
of p53 is one of the most common defects observed in human
cancers. These results imply that statins can circumvent the loss of
wild-type p53 to induce cell cycle arrest through p21 induction.
The human p21 gene contains six Sp1 binding elements (Sp1-1 to
Sp1-6) which play a major role in the regulation of p21 transcription
(32). The transcription factor Sp1 is a member of Sp family that
binds DNA through its COOH terminal zinc-finger motifs. Sp3
shares extensive structural and sequence homology with Sp1 and
also binds to the Sp1 element on the promoters (28, 33). The Sp1
sites have been reported to be critical for p21 induction by HDAC
inhibitors, such as TSA, SAHA, butyrate, and apicidin (34–37). To
examine whether Sp1 element is involved in statin-induced p21
expression, p21 promoter constructs with different Sp1 mutation
were used. The results showed the involvement of Sp1 in lovastatininduced p21 promoter activity, and the major sites are Sp1-3 to
Sp1-6. A model for regulation of p21 through recruitment of HDACs
by Sp1/Sp3, which in turn represses p21 transcription in the resting

state has been reported (38). Supporting this hypothesis are some
studies demonstrating that certain gene promoters are also
repressed by HDACs through their Sp1 sites (39). In this study,
the binding of Sp1/Sp3 to p21 promoter was not changed after
treatment with lovastatin. We recently found the shift of CBP
binding from p53 to p65 after nuclear activation of IKKa, which
tips the balance for the transcriptional regulation of survival and
apoptotic genes (40). This finding inspired us that the Sp1 switch
from HDAC to CBP might exist to regulate p21 expression. DAPA
and ChIP indeed reveal the recruitment of HDAC1 and HDAC2 to

the Sp1/Sp3 site in resting state, in which p21 expression was not
seen. Lovastatin compels HDAC1/2 from p21 promoter and
recruits CBP, resulting in histone-H3 acetylation. Although there
are also reports demonstrating that SAHA release HDAC from Sp1
site on the p21 promoter (34), we are the first to show that statins
decrease the binding of HDAC1/2 and recruit the binding of CBP to
the p21 promoter. Similar to statins, antitumor agents farneyltransferase inhibitors and geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitors
have also been found to up-regulate Rho expression through
dissociation of HDAC and association of p300, leading to histone

and then treated with 30 Amol/L lovastatin or 1 Amol/L TSA for 16 h. Luciferase activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods. Fold induction compared
with the basal activity was expressed as the mean F SE of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, P < 0.05 compared with basal. B, HCT116
(wild type) and HCT116 (p53 / ) cells were treated with 30 Amol/L statins for 16 h, and then whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting
using antibody against p21 or actin. C and D, A549 cells were treated with 30 Amol/L lovastatin or 1 Amol/L TSA for 16 h, and then nuclear extracts were prepared
(C ) or ChIP assay was performed (D). Nuclear extracts were mixed with biotinylated p21 promoter probe containing Sp1-3 to Sp1-6 sites, then Sp1, Sp3, HDAC1,
or HDAC2 were detected by Western blotting, and result is a representative of three independent experiments (C ). ChIP assays were performed using anti-Sp1,
anti-HDAC1, anti-HDAC2, anti-CBP, or anti–acetylated histone-H3 (H3Ac ) antibody or with rabbit nonimmune IgG (control). The precipitated p21 Sp1 region
(+46 to 239) was assayed as described in Materials and Methods. Chromatin (1%) was assayed to verify equal loading (input). Results were falsely colored
black for easier visualization (D).

in vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor
growth. A, cell growth of A549 cells treated

described in Materials and Methods.
Cell viability was compared with control
cells (basal). Points, mean of three

cells (107) were xenotransplanted into
the right hip region of nude mice. After
visible tumor formation, mice were randomly
divided into two groups for p.o. treatment
with lovastatin (20 mg/kg/d) or vehicle as
described in Materials and Methods.
The tumor volume was calculated as follows:
V = 0.52  (width)2  (length). D, tumors

acetylation on the RhoB promoter (41). The incapability of HDACs
to bind DNA directly means that HDACs are recruited indirectly to
the promoter through associating with the Sp1 transcription factor.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that PMA treatment
shifted the binding of Sp1 from HDAC1 to coactivators p300,
leading to the increase of histone-H3 acetylation on 12-(s)lipoxygenase promoter and gene expression (42). The dissociation
of HDAC and binding of p300/PCAF to the gene promoter other
than p21 were only found in transforming growth factor-h type II
receptor induced by TSA (43). Whether other known HDAC
inhibitors or statins have similar effect remains to be determined.
Statins in acid form possess a carboxylic acid–containing
aliphatic chain, a structure similar to the functional group of
TSA and SAHA. We are the first to reveal that statins directly
inhibit HDAC activity. Statins inhibited the HDAC activity in
cancer cells but not in normal cells. Crystallographic studies have
shown a zinc-dependent deacetylation catalyzed by HDLP (21).
TSA mimicking the acetylated lysine has been shown to chelate the
zinc in the catalytic pocket of HDLP by its hydroxamic acid (44).
Our computational simulation revealed that TSA also nicely packs
into the catalytic pocket of mammalian HDAC2 (Fig. 2A). Recent
molecular dynamics simulations identified an additional pocket
adjacent to the catalytic site that can modulate the HDAC2 conformations by accommodating the acetyl-lysine into the catalytic

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

site (45). According to the homology modeling and molecular
docking, we found that lovastatin was able to bind both sites (Fig.
2B and C), suggesting that a composite butterfly compound that
consists of two lovastatin molecules with a linker in-between might
be able to bind HDAC2 even stronger than lovastatin does. Because
the binding affinity of lovastatin to HDAC2 is already at the
micromolar range, it is very likely that the composite butterfly
compound could exhibit picomolar range affinity if the linker
between the two lovastatin molecules is well designed. This novel
binding mode to distinct inhibitor site also provides an additional
opportunity for further drug development.
The HDAC inhibitor–induced increase in p21 expression seems
to play a major role in arresting transformed cell growth. The
relationship between HDAC inhibition and p21 transcription is
based on the results that HDAC inhibitors release HDAC from p21
promoter and accumulate acetylation of the gene-associated
histones (34). Differential groups of HDAC inhibitors with different
K i values, including TSA (0.28 nmol/L), VPA (0.5 mmol/L), or
butyrate (2.25 mmol/L), have been found to induce p21 expression
(46). The results were obtained from separate groups, and effects of
these HDAC inhibitors were not compared simultaneously. In this
study, we compared lovastatin (K i = 32 Amol/L) with TSA and VPA.
The global histone-H3 acetylation induced by 30 Amol/L lovastatin
is comparable with that induced by 0.5 Amol/L TSA and 5 mmol/L

VPA, and so does p21 expression. Although the global histone-H3
acetylation induced by 1 Amol/L TSA is much higher than 30 Amol/
L lovastatin, the extents of p21 induction and histone-H3
acetylation on p21 promoter are quite similar. DNA-bound
histone-H3 acetylation is more accurate to reflect gene transcription, because global increase in acetylated histones is preferentially
localized to the nuclear periphery that might not be associated to
euchromatin (47).
In summary, statins represent a promising approach for cancer
therapy. We proposed an ‘‘epigenetic mechanism’’ for statins.
Compared with other HDAC inhibitors, statins is one of the best
candidates for chemoprevention, because the clinical application
