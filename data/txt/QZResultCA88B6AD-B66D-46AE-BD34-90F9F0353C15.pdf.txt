Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for cancer. However, multidrug resistance (MDR)
remains a major obstacle to effective chemotherapy, limiting the efficacy of both conventional
chemotherapeutic and novel biologic agents. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a
xenosensor, is a key regulator of MDR. It functions in xenobiotic detoxification by regulating the
expression of phase I drug metabolizing enzymes and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters,
whose overexpression in cancers and whose role in drug resistance make them potential
therapeutic targets for reducing MDR. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous negative regulators
of gene expression and have been implicated in most cellular processes, including drug resistance.
Here we report the inversely related expression of miR-137 and CAR in parental and doxorubicinresistant neuroblastoma cells, wherein miR-137 is down-regulated in resistant cells. miR-137
over-expression resulted in down-regulation of CAR protein and mRNA (via mRNA degradation);
it sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells to doxorubicin (as shown by reduced proliferation,
increased apoptosis, and increased G2-phase cell cycle arrest) and reduced the in vivo growth rate
of neuroblastoma xenografts. We observed similar results in cellular models of hepatocellular and
colon cancers, indicating that the doxorubicin-sensitizing effect of miR-137 is not tumor typespecific. Finally, we show for the first time a negative feedback loop whereby miR-137 downregulates CAR expression and CAR down-regulates miR-137 expression. Hypermethylation of the
miR-137 promoter and negative regulation of miR-137 by CAR contribute in part to reduced
miR-137 expression and increased CAR and MDR1 expression in doxorubicin-resistant
neuroblastoma cells. These findings demonstrate that miR-137 is a crucial regulator of cancer
response to doxorubicin treatment, and they identify miR-137 as a highly promising target to
reduce CAR-driven doxorubicin resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the leading cause of cancer treatment failure. Members of the
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family mediate cellular efflux to protect tissues
from xenobiotics. The xenobiotic receptors, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and
pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and
transporters that contribute to drug resistance. 1 Because of the constitutive activity of
CAR, 2 therapies that modulate CAR expression may effectively deter CAR-driven drug
resistance.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Drug resistance is regulated in part by microRNAs (miRNAs), 3 which cause direct mRNA
cleavage or translational repression via sequence-specific base pairing with the 3′ UTRs of
target mRNA. 4 miRNAs regulate many biological processes,5, 6 affect cancer prognosis, 7
and may influence response to chemotherapy. 8, 9 The differential expression of miRNAs in
drug-sensitive versus drug-resistant cells 10–13 suggests that modulation of miRNA
expression may reduce or reverse drug resistance.
Neuroblastoma causes 15% of all childhood cancer-associated mortality. 14 It initially
responds well to chemotherapy but frequently recurs in a chemoresistant form. Evidence
suggests that chemoresistance increases with increased drug efflux mediated by upregulation of ABC transporters, including MDR1, 15–17 and epigenetic silencing of tumor
suppressor genes through DNA hypermethylation. 18, 19 Identification of additional
biomarkers independently associated with survival, and elucidation of their function, may
offer greater insight into the underlying biology of the disease and the mechanisms of
treatment response and relapse. Although miRNAs have not been extensively implicated in
drug resistance in neuroblastoma, several studies have identified miRNAs associated with
poor clinical outcome. 20–23

We investigated the functional relation of miRNAs to CAR, MDR1 (P-glycoprotein), and
chemoresistance. miR-137, one of the few miRNAs predicted to target CAR, was selected
for study because 1) it is broadly conserved in vertebrates, 2) it is reportedly
hypermethylated in cancers, and 3) its absence in cancers is associated with reduced
survival. 24–28 CAR expression was greater and miR-137 expression was less in
doxorubicin-resistant versus -sensitive neuroblastoma cells. Further, miR-137 targeted the
3’UTR of CAR and negatively regulated CAR expression in neuroblastoma, hepatocellular
carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma cells, identifying CAR as a bona fide target of
miR-137. Restoration of miR-137 sensitized doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells and
significantly reduced the growth of doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma xenografts in vivo.
Unexpectedly, CAR negatively regulated miR-137 expression and, together with
hypermethylation of the miR-137 promoter, reduced miR-137 expression in doxorubicinresistant neuroblastoma. These findings warrant further investigation of the clinical potential
of reducing MDR by manipulating miRNA regulation of CAR.

Inverse relation of miR-137 and CAR levels in neuroblastoma cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recent studies have linked cancer drug resistance to altered expression of miRNAs.11 To
investigate the change in miRNA expression in drug-resistant cancer cells, we used the
parental (UKF-NB3) neuroblastoma cell line, isolated from bone marrow metastases from
N-myc-amplified stage 4 neuroblastoma patients, and its doxorubicin-resistant sub-line,
UKF-NB3rDox20 (UKF-NB3/Dox-R) generated by adapting the cells to grow in the
presence of doxorubicin (20 ng/ml) as described, 29, 30 as experimental models. In UKFNB3/Dox-R cells, miR-137 was among the miRNAs dramatically down-regulated, whereas
CAR mRNA was up-regulated with little change in PXR mRNA (Figure 1A & 1B). Western
blot analysis indicated greater expression of CAR and of its transcriptional target genes,
MDR1, 31 CYP2B6, 32 and to a lesser extent, MCL1, 33 in resistant cells than in parental
cells (Figure 1C). Mcl-1 participates in CAR-mediated anti-apoptotic effects and contributes
to doxorubicin resistance. 34–36 In contrast, levels of doxorubicin-regulated Bcl-XL, Bcl-2,
and MMP-1 37–39 were not found to differ significantly (Figure 1C). To determine whether
the observed inversely related expression was cell type–specific, we measured CAR mRNA
and miR-137 in parental and doxorubicin-resistant hepatocellular HepG2 and colon LS174
cancer cells by qRT-PCR. In doxorubicin-resistant cells, expression of miR-137 was lower
and that of CAR mRNA was higher than in parental cells (Supplementary Figure 1A, B &
C). However, HepG2 and LS174 cells expressed significantly greater CAR mRNA and
lower miR-137 than UKF-NB3 cells (Supplementary Figure 1B & C). Taken together, these
data suggest that prolonged doxorubicin treatment down-regulated miR-137, leading to upregulation of CAR and its target gene MDR1, and contributed to doxorubicin resistance.
miR-137 as a negative regulator of CAR
To determine whether elevated CAR levels in doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells
increase the transcriptional activity of CAR, we performed a reporter luciferase assay in
UKF-NB3 and UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells co-transfected with the CAR-regulated CYP2B6
promoter reporter (CYP2B6pro-Luc) 32, 40 and a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) construct (as
transfection control) for 48 h. As expected, CYP2B6pro-Luc activity was significantly
greater in the doxorubicin-resistant cells than in the parental cells (Figure 2A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether miR-137 directly targets the CAR 3’UTR, we used reporter assays
outlined in Figure 2B. 41 In Assay 1 over-expression of miR-137 significantly downregulated reporter activity of CYP2B6 pro-Luc (Figure 2C). In Assay 2 we used pEXZ-CAR
3′UTR-luc, which contains the CAR 3′UTR cloned directly downstream of the luciferase
gene, and Rluc under the control of a CMV promoter as transfection control. The pEXZCAR 3′UTR-luc construct was co-expressed with pSIF, miR-137 (predicted to target CAR),
or miR-514-1 (not predicted to target CAR). miR-137, but not miR-514-1, down-regulated
the activity of pEXZ-CAR 3′UTR-luc (Figure 2D). When mutations that disrupt the binding
of CAR 3′UTR to the miR-137 “seed” sequence were introduced into pEXZ-CAR 3′UTRluc (to generate CAR 3′UTR Mut), the down-regulation of luc by miR-137 was abolished
(Figure 2E), indicating that CAR is a bona fide miR-137 target gene. Steady-state CAR
mRNA levels were significantly reduced when miR-137 was overexpressed (Figure 2F),

indicating that mRNA degradation likely contributed to miR-137–mediated CAR
suppression. As expected, overexpression of miR-137 reduced CAR (both endogenous and
exogenously expressed from the pcDNA-CAR 3'UTR), CYP2B6, MDR1, and Mcl-1
proteins (Figure 2G). Furthermore, miR-137 negatively regulated CYP2B6 pro-Luc when
co-expressed with a pcDNA-CAR-3’UTR construct but not when co-expressed with
pcDNA-CAR (lacking the 3'UTR) (Figure 2H), further demonstrating that miR-137
regulation of CAR is CAR-3’UTR–dependent. Collectively, these data indicate that miR-137
is a bona fide negative regulator of CAR.
miR-137 down-regulates CAR expression and re-sensitizes doxorubicin-resistant cells to
doxorubicin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor-suppressive miRNAs generally target oncogenes or repress cell growth–promoting
factors. miR-137 is viewed as a tumor suppressor down-regulated in cancers. 24, 42, 43
Doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells expressed a lower level of miR-137 and a higher
level of CAR and MDR1 than did parental cells (Figure 1). Doxorubicin is a substrate of
MDR1.44, 45 To test the hypothesis that increased miR-137 reduces levels of CAR to
increase intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and drug sensitivity, we ectopically
expressed miR-137 stably in parental and doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells.
Ectopically expressed miR-137, but not vector control, caused intracellular accumulation of
doxorubicin in UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells (Figure 3A). Over-expression of miR-137 downregulated CAR, CYP2B6, MDR1, and Mcl-1 protein levels in both cell lines (Figure 3B).
Consistent with the intracellular accumulation caused by ectopically expressed miR-137,
doxorubicin treatment resulted in down-regulation of doxorubicin-regulated Bcl-2, Bcl-XL,
MMP1, and CDC25c in doxorubicin-resistant cells when miR-137 was overexpressed
(Figure 3B, right panel). These data suggest that overexpression of miR-137 decreases CAR
and MDR1 to increase intracellular doxorubicin levels. miR-137-mediated down-regulation
of CAR reduced CAR transcriptional activity, which was rescued by pcDNA-CAR but not
by pcDNA-CAR-3’UTR (Figure 3C). In UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells, pcDNA-CAR only
modestly rescued the effect of miR-137 (Figure 3C) (it is likely that the high level of
endogenous CAR masked the effect of exogenously expressed CAR).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Doxorubicin reduces Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to reduce cell proliferation and increase
apoptosis 39, 46; inhibits MMP-1 to reduce cell migration 37; and down-regulates CDC25c to
arrest cell cycle progression. 47, 48 Consistent with the intracellular accumulation of
doxorubicin (Figure 3A) and expression levels of doxorubicin-regulated genes (Figure 3B),
miR-137 re-sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells to doxorubicin treatment, as indicated by
decreased cell viability (Figure 3D), increased activation of caspase 3/7, apoptosis, and G2
cell cycle arrest (Figure 3E–G), and reduced cell migration (Figure 3H), all of which were
rescued by ectopically expressed CAR (pcDNA-CAR lacking the 3’UTR). Similar results
were observed in doxorubicin-resistant HepG2 and LS174T cells (Supplementary Figure 2;
cell migration assay not performed), indicating that the effect of miR-137 on doxorubicin
resistance is not tumor type–specific and that miR-137 may reverse CAR-driven drug
resistance in tumor cells by increasing intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin.

To further confirm that the overexpressed CAR was functional and could be modulated, we
showed that the CAR inverse agonist clotrimazole decreased, while the CAR agonist CITCO
increased, CYP2B6 promoter activity (Figure 4A) and endogenous MDR1 and CYP2B6
mRNA levels (Figure 4B). In addition, in a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay,
CAR bound to CYP2B6 promoter, and this binding was decreased when miR-137 was
ectopically expressed (Figure 4C). IgG and anti-RNA polymerase II were used as nonspecific negative and positive controls, respectively, in the ChIP assay. To further confirm
the inverse relation between miR-137 level and CAR, we used anti-miR-137 (antisense
oligonucleotides harboring complementary reverse sequences of miR-137 expressed from a
plasmid) to reduce the level of endogenous miR-137, which increased the level of CAR
mRNA (Figure 4D) and CAR, MDR1, and CYP2B6 protein (Figure 4E) in doxorubicinsensitive neuroblastoma cells (which possess higher levels of endogenous miR-137). AntimiR-137 also reduced the doxorubicin sensitivity of UKF-NB3 cells, as measured by cell
viability and caspase 3/7 activation (Figure 4F & G). CITCO, clotrimazole, and antimiR-137 produced similar effects in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Supplementary Figure
3). Collectively, our findings showed that the overexpressed CAR in doxorubicin-resistant
cells is functional and that increasing levels of miR-137 reduce CAR and MDR1 levels,
increase intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and re-sensitize the doxorubicin-resistant
cells.
CAR and miR-137 form a negative feedback loop and hypermethylation of the miR-137
promoter contributes to reduced miR-137 expression in doxorubicin-resistant cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CAR is involved in both transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression.49 To
determine whether CAR contributes to reduced miR-137 expression in UKF-NB3/Dox-R
cells, we performed qRT-PCR after overexpression of CAR. Exogenously expressed CAR
led to reduced miR-137 expression (Figure 5A). Of the two putative promoters that might
regulate expression of miR-137, the distal promoter should also regulate miR-2682.
Overexpression of CAR did not affect expression of miR-2682 (Supplementary Figure 4),
suggesting that CAR represses miR-137 expression at the proximal promoter. For
confirmation, we cloned the miR-137 promoter into the pGL4.20 vector directly upstream of
the luciferase gene (miR-137pro-Luc) and co-expressed this construct with pcDNA-CAR
plasmid. We found significantly less miR-137pro-Luc activity in cells expressing CAR than
in those expressing pcDNA3.1+ (Figure 5B). To determine whether CAR repression of the
miR-137 promoter is compromised by ectopically expressed miR-137, we examined the
activity of miR-137pro-Luc in HepG2 cells co-transfected with pSIF or miR-137 and
pcDNA-CAR or pcDNA-CAR 3'UTR. miR-137pro-Luc activity increased in cells cotransfected with miR-137 and pcDNA-CAR 3’UTR but not in cells co-expressing miR-137
and pcDNA-CAR (construct lacking the 3'UTR) (Figure 5C). These results indicated an
unusual negative feedback loop between miR-137 and CAR.
Several studies have shown down-regulation of miR-137 in various tumors,24, 42, 43 and
hypermethylation at the miR-137 promoter contributes to the down-regulation. 24–26 We
performed methylation-specific PCR of the miR-137 promoters and found that the
promoters were more methylated in UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells than in UKF-NB3 cells (Figure
5D), suggesting that methylation contributes to the reduced miR-137 expression in these

cells. In UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells cultured in doxorubicin, methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine
(72 h treatment) increased miR-137 expression, reduced CAR mRNA (Figure 5E) and
reduced protein levels of CAR, MDR, and CYP2B6 (Figure 5F).
Collectively, these data indicate a negative feedback loop between miR-137 and CAR,
wherein CAR negatively regulates miR-137 expression and miR-137 negatively regulates
CAR expression. Increased methylation of the miR-137 promoter also contributes to the
lower miR-137 expression in doxorubicin-resistant cells. Therefore, miR-137 promoter
hypermethylation and CAR overexpression contribute to down-regulation of miR-137 in
doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells.
miR-137 reduces growth of doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma xenografts

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Soft-agar colony formation assays are routinely used to detect anchorage-independent
growth (a hallmark of cell transformation). We used this assay to investigate whether
miR-137 sensitization of doxorubicin-resistant cells was sufficient to reduce their
transformation capability. UKF-NB3 and UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells stably expressing pSIF or
miR-137 (Figure 6A) were incubated in soft agar for 2 weeks, with vehicle or doxorubicin
treatment every 72 h. Without doxorubicin, the two cell lines formed colonies of similar
number and size, regardless of miR-137overexpression (Figure 6B). With doxorubicin
treatment, pSIF- and miR-137–expressing doxorubicin-sensitive UKF-NB3 cells formed
smaller and fewer colonies (smallest in miR-137–expressing cells). Significantly, miR-137–
expressing UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells formed smaller and fewer colonies with doxorubicin
treatment than did pSIF-expressing cells (Figure 6B). Exogenous overexpression of CAR
rescued the reduced colony formation, indicating that this reduction was CAR-dependent
(Figure 6B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next used a subcutaneous xenograft model to determine whether miR-137 reduces the
growth of doxorubicin-treated UKF-NB3/Dox-R tumors in vivo. The growth rate of the
doxorubicin-sensitive tumor cells was reduced by doxorubicin irrespective of miR-137
expression (Figure 6C). In contrast, the growth rate of UKF-NB3/Dox-R xenografts was
reduced by doxorubicin only when miR-137 was expressed (Figure 6C). MDR1 levels were
reduced in all xenografts in which miR-137 was expressed, regardless of doxorubicin
treatment (Figure 6D). In UKF-NB3 xenografts, doxorubicin treatment led to higher levels
of cleaved caspase 3, irrespective of miR-137 expression. However, in UKF-NB3/Dox-R
xenografts, doxorubicin treatment increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 only when miR-137
was expressed (Figure 6D). qRT-PCR confirmed the higher expression of miR-137 from
miR-137-expressing tumors (Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure 5A) and the inversely
related CAR mRNA levels (Figure 6F and Supplementary Figure 5B). Together, these
results indicated that the miR-137 level is crucial to the response of neuroblastoma to
doxorubicin.

DISCUSSION
Here we showed that expression of CAR and its target, MDR1, is higher in doxorubicinresistant neuroblastoma cells than in their doxorubicin-sensitive parental cells, whereas PXR
shows no change. This finding suggests that CAR, reported to be overexpressed in various

other cancers, drives doxorubicin resistance via up-regulation of MDR1. We showed that
negative regulators of CAR, such as miR-137, can reduce CAR-mediated drug resistance.

Evidence increasingly suggests that epigenetic changes play a crucial role in the
development and progression of human malignancies.50 Altered expression of miRNAs, a
common feature of malignancies,51, 52 has recently been linked to epigenetic
mechanisms. 53 Methylation of the CpG island of miR-137 has been discovered in oral, 27
colon, 24, 25 and gastric 26 cancers, associated with poorer survival in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma, 28 and detected in oral rinses from these patients, suggesting its
utility as a cancer biomarker. 54 Balaguer et al. showed that miR-137 is epigenetically
regulated in colorectal cancer and that reduced expression contributes to colorectal
carcinogenesis. 24 miR-137 is considered to act as a tumor suppressor by targeting prosurvival genes such as those encoding CDK6, MITF, 42 CDC42,55 and ERRα.56 We showed
that increased methylation of the miR-137 promoter contributes to reduced miR-137
expression in doxorubicin-resistant cells. Further, treatment of doxorubicin-resistant cells
with the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine resulted in up-regulation of miR-137
expression. We also found that CAR negatively regulates miR-137. Our findings
demonstrate that CAR overexpression contributes to reduced miR-137 expression.
Therefore, we have shown for the first time a negative feedback loop between CAR and
miR-137, wherein each negatively regulates the other.
Down-regulation of CAR by miR-137 reduced expression of MDR1, suggesting that levels
of miR-137 may affect intracellular drug levels. We found that intracellular doxorubicin
levels were higher in miR-137–expressing than in pSIF-expressing cells, resulting in
decreased expression of doxorubicin-regulated proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, MMP-1,
CDC25c) and increased sensitivity of doxorubicin-resistant cells to doxorubicin, as
evidenced by increased G2 cell cycle arrest, caspase 3/7 activity, and apoptosis and
decreased cell proliferation. Overexpression of miR-137 significantly increased the
doxorubicin-mediated growth inhibition of xenografts in mice. The effect of miR-137 on
doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells was not tumor-specific, as results were similar in
doxorubicin-resistant colon cancer (LS174) and hepatocellular cancer (HepG2) cell lines.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We observed lower expression of miR-137 and greater reciprocal expression of CAR and
MDR1 in doxorubicin-resistant cells than in parental cells. Multiple studies have shown
miR-137 to act as a tumor suppressor whose promoter is hypermethylated in cancer, 24–28
suggesting that miR-137 might play a role in carcinogenesis. We have demonstrated for the
first time that epigenetic silencing of an miRNA (miR-137) in doxorubicin-resistant cells
contributes to over-expression of CAR and, in turn, MDR1. miR-137, which negatively
regulates CAR (and in turn MDR1 and CYP2B6), sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells to
doxorubicin. Down-regulation of MDR1 and CYP2B6 increased the intracellular
doxorubicin levels, enhancing the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin. We also report for the
first time a negative feedback loop between CAR and miR-137, in which one negatively
regulates the expression of the other. Collectively, our results suggest a novel therapeutic
possibility: incorporation of a miRNA into combination chemotherapy to reduce drug efflux
in cancers that develop CAR-mediated drug resistance. Synthetic miRNAs (miR mimetics)
can mimic the endogenous functions of an miRNA but have not yet demonstrated in vivo

efficacy because of low stability and poor cellular delivery. 57–60 Alternative approaches to
increase the expression of endogenous miRNA, including the use of small molecules, 41, 61
should be explored to further validate this therapeutic concept. Figure 7 summarizes the
functional relationships of miR-137, CAR, MDR1, and cellular drug sensitivity revealed by
our findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, transfection, and transduction
Cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2. 293T, HepG2, and LS174 (ATCC, Manassas, VA)
were cultured according to ATCC guidelines. UKF-NB3 and UKF-NB3/Dox-R were
cultured as previously described. 29, 62–64 The doxorubicin-resistant HepG2 and LS174 cells
(HepG2/Dox-R, LS174/Dox-R) were generated by adapting the cells to doxorubicin (20
ng/ml) for 4–6 months in essential modified Eagle’s medium (EMEM, ATCC)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic
solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

CAR 3’UTR was cloned by GeneCopoeia Inc. (Rockville, MD) directly downstream of a
luciferase gene of the pEZX-MT01 vector, which also carries a Renilla luciferase (Rluc)
gene controlled by a CMV promoter (transfection control). The pEZX-CAR 3’UTR mutant
contains mutations at the binding site of the miR-137 “seed” region (5'…AGCAAUAA…3’
to 5'…AGTGGCGA…3’) (Mutagenex, Piscataway, NJ). We used the forward (5'ATTCTAGAGGCCATGCTCACTTCC-3’) and reverse (5'CTTTCTGATTTCGTTATTCGCCGGCGTA-3’) primers to PCR-amplify the CAR 3’UTR
from pEZX-CAR 3’UTR and inserted it into pcDNA-CAR (containing the full human CAR
coding sequence) directly downstream of the CAR gene to generate a pcDNA-CAR 3’UTR.
The miR-137 promoter was PCR-amplified from HepG2 genomic DNA by using forward
(5'-TCCGATCTGGAAGTTCCGCG-3’) and reverse (5'GTAGCACTTTCTTGTTCTTTTC-3’) primers and cloned directly upstream of a luciferase
gene in pGL4.20 (Promega) to generate the pGL4.20-miR-137pro-Luc. All miRNA
constructs were obtained from an existing library, 41 and all DNA constructs were confirmed
by Sanger sequencing.
The following primary antibodies were used in Western blot analyses: anti-CAR (sc-8540),
anti-MDR1 (sc-55510), anti-CYP2B6 (sc-67224), anti-Mcl-1 (sc-12756), anti-Bcl-XL
(sc-8392), anti-Bcl-2 (sc-509), anti-MMP-1 (sc-21731), anti-CDC25c (sc-55513) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-β-actin (AC-15) (Sigma). Secondary

expression levels in parental cells. We used TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems Inc.) to
measure expression of mature miRNAs and CAR mRNA, using U6 RNA and β-actin

unmethylated bisulfite-converted human DNAs (Qiagen) were used as positive and negative
controls. Band intensity was measured by using ImageJ software. Three samples were
analyzed per cell line.
Doxorubicin intracellular uptake assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

UKF-NB3 and UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells stably expressing pSIF- or miR-137 (1×106/well)
were seeded into 6-well plates, incubated with DMSO or 0.5 µM doxorubicin for 6 hours at
37°C, washed ×2 with FACS buffer, and resuspended in FACS buffer (0.5% bovine serum
albumin in PBS). The intrinsic fluorescence of intracellular doxorubicin 67 was excited with
an argon laser at 488 nm and emission was read in an LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD
Bioscience), using a 620-nm filter.68, 69 Histograms were generated using FlowJo 10
software (Tree Star), and each included a minimum of 200,000 living cells.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
UKF-NB3 and UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells stably expressing pSIF- or miR-137 and plated in 10mm dishes were cross-linked and processed as previously described. 70 Precleared
chromatin solution was incubated overnight at 4°C with 5 µg of anti-hCAR (Perseus
Proteomics), anti-RNA Pol II (positive control), or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; negative control). Immunoprecipitates were collected and DNA was purified
by using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The PBREM region of
the CYP2B6 promoter was amplified by the SYBR green method, using the purified DNA as
template and the primers CYP2B6-F: 5′-CTGCAATGAGCACCCAATCTT-3’ and
CYP2B6-R: 5′-ACACATCCTCTGACAGGGTCA-3′ as previously described.71

Cellular assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether miR-137 targets the 3’UTR of CAR, cells were co-transfected with
pEZX-CAR 3'UTR (wild-type or mutated at the miR-137 “seed” binding region) and pSIF,
miR-137, or miR-514-1 for 48 h in 96-well plates, and the Dual-Glo luciferase assay
(Promega) was performed. Values were normalized to pSIF control. CAR transcriptional
activity was determined similarly after co-transfection of cells with a CYP2B6 promoterluciferase construct (CYP2B6pro-Luc), CMV-Rluc, pcDNA-CAR, or pcDNA-CAR 3’UTR
and pSIF or miR-137 for 48 h. The effect of miR-137 on endogenous CAR activity was
assessed in UKF-NB3 and UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells co-transfected for 48 h with CYP2B6proLuc, CMV-Rluc, and pSIF or miR-137. To determine whether CAR regulates the miR-137
promoter, cells were co-transfected for 48 h with pSIF or miR-137; pcDNA-CAR, or
pcDNA-CAR 3'UTR; and pGL4.20 or pGL4.20-miR-137pro-Luc. Luminescence was read
on an Envision Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer; Waltham, MA).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell proliferation was assessed by using the Cell Titer Glo assay (Promega). Apoptosis was
measured by using the Annexin V apoptosis assay (Miltenyi Biotec; Auburn, CA) in 6-well
format and the Caspase Glo 3/7 kit (Promega) in a 96-well format. Cells were transfected in
96-well plates with pSIF or miR-137 with or without pcDNA-CAR and treated with vehicle
or 0.5 µM doxorubicin for 72 h and 24 h, respectively, before the assays. Similar assays
were performed after transfection of cells with an anti-sense miR-137 plasmid or a
scrambled antisense control.
Cell migration was assayed in Matrigel-coated transwell chambers (Becton Dickinson) with
8-µm pores, reconstituted with fresh medium for 2 h. Cells (2 × 104 ml−1 in 0.5 ml serumfree MEM in 12-well plates) were added to the upper chambers, and 1 ml MEM
supplemented with 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber. After 24 h, cells were fixed
with 70% ethanol and stained with 0.4% crystal violet for 2 h. Non-migrating cells were
removed with a cotton swab from the upper side of the filter. The filter was mounted on a
glass microscope slide, and cells were quantified by using ImageJ software. Results were
expressed as the mean number of migrated cells normalized to the number of live cells
cultured in parallel. Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described. 72
Soft agar colony–formation assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Two thousand viable cells in 1.5 ml of culture medium containing 1% glutamine, antibiotics,
and 0.2% soft agar were layered on 0.5% solidified agar in IMDM culture medium in 6-well
plates, incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks, and stained with MTT reagent. Colony foci were
counted by light microscopy (magnification 4×). Experiments were performed in triplicate.
Mouse xenografts and immunohistochemical analyses
All animal experiments were approved by the St. Jude Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Male ~6-week-old immunodeficient NCr nude mice (Taconic Farms, Hudson,
NY) (5 per group) were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 × 106 cells in 200 µl of 1× PBS.
After 2 weeks, animals were randomly divided into two groups per cell line. Mice were
injected intraperitoneally with doxorubicin hydrochloride (carboxylate form; Sigma) 0.5

width x height) was measured every two days.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The LabVision 720 IHC Stainer (ThermoShandon, Fremont, CA) was used for
immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissue. Tissue samples on slides were incubated for
120 min with primary antibodies (anti-MDR1 [sc-55510], Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100;
or anti-cleaved caspase 3 [CP229C], BioCare Medicinal, Concord, CA, 1:100) and then for
30 min with secondary antibodies (rodent anti-mouse, rodent anti-rabbit [BioCare Medical;
RMR622L], donkey anti-goat polymer-HRP [Santa Cruz Biotechnology; SC-2042], and
Quanto mouse on mouse-HRP [Thermo Fisher, Fremont, CA; TL-060-QHDM]). The
stained slides were counterstained with DAB chromogen and hematoxylin
(ThermoShandon), evaluated histologically for proteins of interest by two independent,
blinded observers, and scored according to intensity of staining (0, negative; 1, weak; 2,
moderate; 3, strong).
Statistical analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of at least three independent
experiments. Sample and control values were compared as indicated in the figure legends by
using the two-tailed Student's t-test, and p ≤ 0.05 (* or #) was considered statistically
significant.

miR-137 negatively regulates CAR by directly targeting its 3'UTR. (A) CYP2B6pro-Luc
activity is higher in UKF-NB3/Dox-R than in UKF-NB3 cells. Luciferase assay was
performed 48 h after transfection. The y-axis denotes the relative luciferase units (RLU) of
CYP2B6pro-Luc (normalized to the co-transfected Renilla luciferase reporter, Rluc). RLU

test. (B) Outline of Assays 1 (to determine whether miR-137 represses CAR) and 2 (to
determine whether miR-137 directly targets the CAR 3'UTR. (C) In Assay 1, miR-137
down-regulates CYP2B6pro-Luc. pSIF control expressed scrambled sequence. A Dual-Glo
luciferase assay was performed 48 h after transfection. The y-axis denotes RLU of
CYP2B6pro-Luc (normalized to Rluc). (D) In Assay 2, miR-137, but not miR-514-1 (a

Immunoblotting shows that expression of endogenous and exogenous CAR and its
transcriptional targets MDR-1, CYP2B6 and Mcl-1 is reduced by overexpression of
miR-137 in UKF-NB3/Dox-R cells. β-actin was used as loading control. (H) miR-137
down-regulates pcDNA-CAR-3’UTR but not pcDNA-CAR. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with plasmids as indicated. * Indicates p ≤ 0.05. In the Student’s t test, RLU

MMP-1 are reduced in UKF-NB2/Dox-R cells treated with 0.1 µM doxorubicin only when
miR-137 was overexpressed. β-actin was used as loading control. (C) Down-regulation of
CYP2B6pro-Luc by miR-137 is rescued by pcDNA-CAR. Cells were co-transfected with
the indicated plasmids or control (pcDNA3.1+). RLU from miR-137 was compared to that
from pSIF-transfected cells in the Student’s t test. (D-H) miR-137 re-sensitizes UKF-NB3/

thereby reducing miR-137 (D), inducing CAR (D and E), MDR1, and CYP2B6 (E), and
significantly reducing the doxorubicin sensitivity of UKF-NB3 cells, as shown by cell
viability (F) and caspase 3/7 activation (G) assays. * and # Indicate p ≤ 0.05. In the
Student’s t test in experiments shown in (F) and (G), samples were compared to the control

Dox-R tumors, MDR1 is down-regulated by miR-137 but cleaved caspase 3 is up-regulated
by doxorubicin only when miR-137 is overexpressed. Top: representative
immunohistochemistry images showing MDR1 and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Bottom:
