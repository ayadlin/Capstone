Abstract
The effective use of targeted therapy is highly dependent upon the identification of responder
patient populations. Loss of the Fbw7 tumor suppressor is frequently found in various types of
human cancers including breast cancer, colon cancer 1 and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL)2. In line with these genomic data, engineered deletion of Fbw7 in mouse T cells results
in T-ALL3–5, validating Fbw7 as a T-ALL tumor suppressor. The precise molecular mechanisms

by which Fbw7 exerts anti-tumor activity remain areas of intensive investigation and are thought
to relate in part to Fbw7-mediated destruction of key cancer relevant proteins including c-Jun6, cMyc 7, Cyclin E 8 and Notch-19, all of which possess oncogenic activity and are overexpressed in
various human cancers including leukemia. Besides accelerating cell growth 10, overexpression of
either c-Jun, c-Myc or Notch-1 can also provoke programmed cell death 11. Thus, considerable
uncertainty surrounds how Fbw7-deficient cells evade cell death in the setting of upregulated cJun, c-Myc and/or Notch-1. Here we report that SCFFbw7 governs cellular apoptosis by targeting
the pro-survival Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, for ubiquitination and destruction in a GSK3
phosphorylation-dependent manner. Human T-ALL cell lines showed a close relationship between
Fbw7 loss and Mcl-1 overexpression. Correspondingly, T-ALL cell lines with defective Fbw7 are
particularly sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, but resistant to the Bcl-2 antagonist,
ABT-737. On the genetic level, Fbw7 reconstitution or Mcl-1 depletion restores ABT-737
sensitivity, establishing Mcl-1 as a therapeutically relevant bypass survival mechanism for Fbw7deficient cells to evade apoptosis. Therefore, our work provides novel molecular insight into
Fbw7-direct tumor suppression with direct implications for the targeted treatment of Fbw7deficient T-ALL patients.

Mcl-1 is frequently overexpressed in various leukemias via mechanisms that are not fully
understood 12. Mcl-1 is distinct from other Bcl-2 family members in its extremely unstable
nature 13, which provides a mechanism for cells to switch into either survival or apoptotic
mode in response to various stresses 14. While GSK3 phosphorylation regulates Mcl-1
stability 13, little is known about the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets
phosphorylated Mcl-1 for destruction. Upon examination of the GSK3 sites on Mcl-1, we
surmised that they resemble a possible degron sequence that can be recognized by Fbw7
(Fig. 1a), prompting us to test the possibility that GSK3 phosphorylation of Mcl-1 triggers
its degradation by Fbw7. Depletion of Fbw7 (Fig. 1b) or SCF components Cullin-1, Rbx1
and Skp1 (Fig. 1c), but not other F-box proteins we examined (Fig. 1b), resulted in a
significant increase in Mcl-1. T-cell lineage-specific depletion of Fbw7 in Lck-Cre/Fbw7fl/fl
mice 3 exhibited elevated Mcl-1 levels in their thymi (Fig. 1d) as well as resulting thymic
lymphoma (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and acute leukemia cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Consistent with Wertz et al.15, Fbw7−/− DLD1 (Fig. 1e) and siFbw7 treated HeLa cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1c) have elevated Mcl-1 expression mainly in the M and early G1 cell
cycle phases. The clinical relevance of this finding is further demonstrated by the fact that
T-ALL cell lines harboring Fbw7 mutations/deletions have a significant increase in Mcl-1
(Fig. 1f). Additionally, depletion of Fbw7 in DND41 or Loucy cells (with wild-type Fbw7)
leads to increased Mcl-1 expression (Fig. 1g) while re-introduction of wild-type Fbw7
dramatically reduced Mcl-1 expression in Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cells (Fig. 1h), supporting
a causal relationship between loss of Fbw7 activity and elevated Mcl-1 expression in the TALL cells examined. More importantly, elevated Mcl-1 expression is also observed in both
primary human and murine T-ALL samples with deficient Fbw7 activity (Fig. 1i, Fig. 1j 2
and Supplementary Fig. 1a–b 3, 4), and depletion of Mcl-1 impaired T-ALL disease
progression in vivo (Fig. 1k–m). Consistent with a post-translational mode of regulation, no
changes in Mcl-1 mRNA levels were observed after depletion of Fbw7 in DLD1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 2d), and no positive relationship was observed between Mcl-1 mRNA
levels and loss of Fbw7 in T-ALL cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e). The half-life of Mcl-1 was

significantly extended in the thymi of Fbw7−/− mice and Fbw7-deficient human T-ALL
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c) and experimental manipulation of Fbw7 levels changed
Mcl-1 stability accordingly (Supplementary Fig. 3d–e). Together, these results suggest that
Mcl-1 is a downstream ubiquitination target for SCFFbw7.

As proper substrate phosphorylation events are required for Fbw7 to recognize and target its
substrates for ubiquitination 16, we next investigated which phosphorylation events that
trigger Mcl-1 destruction by Fbw7. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Mcl-1 is
phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). In addition
to Ser159 and Thr163 13, 17, Ser64 and Ser121 were also phosphorylated in vivo.
Consistent with previous reports 13, 17, Mcl-1 destruction is promoted by GSK3 (Fig. 2b),
but not ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). To further investigate the significance of each
individual phosphorylation site, we created a panel of Mcl-1 mutants (Fig. 2c). Using in
vitro kinase assays, we identified Ser159 and Thr163 as the major GSK3 phosphorylation
sites17 and Ser121 as a minor GSK3 phosphorylation site (Fig. 2d–e and Supplementary
Fig. 5g). Inactivation of these GSK3 phosphorylation sites impairs the interaction between
Mcl-1 and Fbw7 both in vitro (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 5h) and in vivo (Fig. 2g and
Supplementary Fig. 5i). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 activity blocked
the interaction between HA-Fbw7 and endogenous Mcl-1 (Fig. 2h) and inhibited the
localization of Fbw7 to the mitochondria where Mcl-1 resides (Supplementary Fig. 5 j–k).
These results indicated that GSK3-dependent phosphorylation of Mcl-1 is necessary for its
interaction with Fbw7. Consistent with this Fbw7-Mcl-1 regulatory axis, Mcl-1 specifically
interacts with Fbw7 (Supplementary Fig. 6a–b and 6j–l) and Cullin-1 (Supplementary Fig.
6c–d) and depletion of endogenous Cullin-1 increases Mcl-1 abundance (Supplementary
Fig. 11a).

We next explored the mechanism by which Fbw7 alters Mcl-1 stability. Overexpression of
Fbw7 and GSK3 significantly decreased Mcl-1 abundance (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig.
6h), while inactivation of the major GSK3 phosphorylation sites impaired Fbw7-mediated
destruction (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 6e–g). All Fbw7 isoforms (particularly α and γ)
participate in Mcl-1 stability control and Fbw7 dimerization is not required to degrade Mcl-1
(Supplementary Fig. 7a–e). Mutant Fbw7 constructs derived from T-ALL patients displayed
reduced ability to interact with Mcl-l (Supplementary Fig. 6i), and were therefore unable to
degrade Mcl-1 (Fig. 3c). Moreover, Fbw7/GSK3-mediated Mcl-1 destruction was blocked
by MG132, indicating the involvement of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in this process
(Fig. 3a). In support of this idea, co-expression of GSK3 and Fbw7 resulted in a marked
reduction in the half-life of wild-type Mcl-1, but not the 2A or 3A Mcl-1 mutants (Fig. 3d)
with reduced interaction with Fbw7 (Fig. 2g). Furthermore, loss of Fbw7 extends the halflife of endogenous Mcl-1 (Fig. 3e), and Fbw7 promotes Mcl-1 ubiquitination in a GSK3dependent manner (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 8a–b and 8e). The decrease of Mcl-1
expression is also impaired in response to various DNA-damaging agents 18 in Fbw7−/−
DLD1 cells (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 8f). These data together suggested a
physiological role for Fbw7 in promoting Mcl-1 destruction in vivo in a GSK3
phosphorylation-dependent manner.

Next we explored how Fbw7 affects the cellular apoptotic response by modulating Mcl-1
abundance. As predicted, Fbw7−/− mouse thymocytes and Fbw7-deficient human T-ALL
cells with increased Mcl-1 levels were less sensitive to apoptotic stimuli (Supplementary
Fig. 9 a–f). More interestingly, compared with T-ALL cell lines with wild-type Fbw7,
Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cells with elevated Mcl-1 expression (Fig. 1f and Supplementary
Fig. 9h) were more sensitive to sorafenib, which can effectively reduce Mcl-1 expression
(Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 9g–i) 19, 20. Although sorafenib’s ability to repress Mcl-1 has
been attributed to inactivating MAPK kinase and/or activating GSK-3 activity 19, the exact
mechanism remains unclear. Nonetheless, this data suggests that Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cell
lines might require elevated levels of Mcl-1 to evade apoptosis, a phenotype known as
“oncogene addiction” 21. On the other hand, Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cell lines were more
resistant to ABT-737 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 9g and 9j). The BH3 mimetic ABT-737
is a pan-inhibitor of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins, which is reported to
effectively kill leukemia cells 22. However, leukemia cells with elevated Mcl-1 are
refractory to ABT-737 23, 24 primarily because ABT-737 fails to inactivate Mcl-1 22.
Experimental evidence from both 7-AAD/Annexin V double staining (Supplementary Fig.
9j) and immunoblots against apoptotic biomarkers (Fig. 4b) suggest that ABT-737-induced
apoptosis is impaired in Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cells. Moreover, specific depletion of Mcl-1
in multiple Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cell lines restored their sensitivity to ABT-737 (Fig.4c–
d), supporting the notion that increased Mcl-1 expression is the primary cause of
desensitization to ABT-737 in vivo 23, 24. It also suggests that Fbw7-deficient T-ALL
patients will not respond well to ABT-737 treatment. We further demonstrated that
manipulation of Fbw7 activity or ectopic expression of a non-degradable Mcl-1 in human TALL cells affects their ABT-737 sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 10a–b) and response to
other apoptotic stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 10c–f).

Our results imply that inhibition of Mcl-1 could be used to restore ABT-737 sensitivity in
Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cells. Given that the clinical application of siRNA- or shRNAmediated target extinction is not yet mature due to delivery challenges, we instead exploited
small molecule strategies to reduce Mcl-1 expression, specifically with the use of sorafenib
(Supplementary Fig. 9h). To this end, combined use of sorafenib and ABT-737 produced a
dose-dependent increase of ABT-737 sensitivity for HPB-ALL (Supplementary Fig. 10g),
which correlated with a significant increase in the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4e). Similar
results were obtained with other Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 10h).

Author Manuscript

Our studies provide experimental evidence for a role of Fbw7 in governing the apoptotic
pathway by controlling Mcl-1 destruction. Mcl-1 plays a key role in regulating the cellular
apoptosis of T cells 14, but not other tissue types such as liver cells. Therefore, our studies
also provide a possible mechanism for why loss of Fbw7 is frequently seen in T-ALL
patients. Although other E3 ubiquitin ligases including c-Mule 25 and β-TRCP 17 have been
implicated in Mcl-1 stability control, c-Mule activity was not implicated in GSK3-dependent
regulation of Mcl-1 (Supplementary Fig. 11a–e) 17, 25. Additionally, no correlation was
found between c-Mule and Mcl-1 expression in various T-ALL cells (Supplementary Fig.
11f), excluding a physiological role for c-Mule in regulating Mcl-1 abundance in T-ALL.
We further found that depletion of Fbw7, but not β-TRCP, leads to a significant induction of

Mcl-1 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 11a–c). Array CGH analysis demonstrated a high
frequency of Fbw7 loss 2, but not simultaneous loss of β-TRCP1 and β-TRCP2 in T-ALL
(data not shown). Altogether, these data support the hypothesis that Fbw7 is a physiological
E3 ubiquitin ligase for Mcl-1 with USP9X as the nominated deubiquitinase 26, and loss of
Fbw7 contributes to T-ALL development via Mcl-1 upregulation. More importantly, our
studies suggest that there is a correlation between Fbw7 genetic status and ABT-737
sensitivity and further provide insight into the usage of Mcl-1 inhibitors as a practical
method to specifically kill Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cells. This work provides a basis for the
rational treatment of T-ALL patients and motivates the development of specific Mcl-1
antagonists, or agents that significantly reduce Mcl-1 expression for the improved
management of T-ALL patients.

Cell culture including synchronization and transfection has been described 6, 28. Wild type
and Fbw7−/− DLD1 cell lines were kind gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein. Murine T-ALL cell
lines derived from Tal1 transgenic mice were kind gifts from Dr. Michele A. Kelliher.
Human T-ALL cell lines were previously described 2. Loucy and CMLT1 T-ALL cell lines
were obtained from Jon Aster. For various assays described below, as indicated in the figure
legends, T-ALL cells were cultured in either 0.5% FBS or 10% FBS-containing medium for
sorafenib (Alexis Biochemicals) or ABT-737 (Symansis) treatment. In the case of combined
treatment with both sorafenib and ABT-737, T-ALL cells were maintained in 10% FBScontaining medium. Lentiviral shRNA virus packaging, retrovirus packaging, and
subsequent infections were performed as described previously 28. For cell viability assays,
cells were plated at 10,000 per well in 96-well plates, and incubated with the appropriate
medium containing sorafenib, ABT-737 or DMSO for 48 h. Assays were performed with
CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega). For detection of apoptosis, cells treated with various drugs were
stained with propidium iodide (Roche), or co-stained with Annexin V-PE and 7-aminoactinomycin D (Annexin V-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I, BD Bioscience) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Stained cells were sorted with Dako-Cytomation MoFlos sorter
(Dako) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute FACS core facility.
Immunoblots and Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed in EBC (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) buffer
supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors
(phosphatase inhibitor cocktail set I and II, Calbiochem). The protein concentrations of the
lysates were measured using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay reagent on a Beckman
Coulter DU-800 spectrophotometer. The lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, 800 µg lysates were
incubated with the appropriate antibody (1–2 µg) for 3–4 h at 4 °C followed by one-hour
incubation with Protein-A Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Immuno-complexes were
washed five times with NETN buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA
and 0.5% NP-40) before being resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the
indicated antibodies. Quantification of the immunoblot band intensity was performed with
Image J software.
Detection of Mcl-1 phosphorylation sites in vivo

Author Manuscript

To map Mcl-1 phosphorylation status in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with HA-Mcl-1
using the calcium phosphate method. Thirty hours post-transfection, 293T cells were treated
with 10 µM MG132 for 16 hours to block the 26S proteasome pathway prior to collecting
the whole cell lysates for HA-immunoprecipitation. After extensive washing with NETN
buffer, the HA-immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by
colloidal Coomassie Blue. The band containing Mcl-1 was excised and treated with DTT to
reduce disulfide bonds and iodoacetamide to derivatize cysteine residues. In-gel digestion of
the protein was done using trypsin or chymotrypsin. The resulting peptides were extracted
from the gel and analyzed by nanoscale-microcapillary reversed phase liquid

chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Peptides were separated across a
37-min gradient ranging from 4% to 27% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in a
microcapillary (125 µm × 18 cm) column packed with C18 reverse-phase material (Magic
C18AQ, 5 µm particles, 200 Å pore size, Michrom Bioresources) and on-line analyzed on
The LTQ Orbitrap XL™ hybrid FTMS (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). For each
cycle, one full MS scan acquired on the Orbitrap at high mass resolution was followed by
ten MS/MS spectra on the linear ion trap XL from the ten most abundant ions. MS/MS
spectra were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm against a database created on the basis
of a protein sequence database containing the sequence for Mcl-1, for common
contaminants, such as human keratins protein with static modification of cysteine
carboxymethylation, dynamic modification of methionine oxidation and serine, threonine
and tyrosine phosphorylation. All peptide matches were filtered based on mass deviation,
tryptic state, XCorr and dCn and confirmed by manual validation. The reliability of sitelocalization of phosphorylation events was evaluated using the Ascore algorithm.
Real-time RT-PCR Analysis
RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, and the reverse transcription reaction
was performed using the ABI Taqman Reverse Transcriptional Reagents (N808-0234). After
mixing the resulting template with Mcl-1 (Hs00172036_m1) or GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1)
primers and ABI Taqman Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (4352042), the real-time RT-PCR
was performed with the ABI-7500 Fast Real-time PCR system. Fbw7 (Hs00217794_m1),
Skp2 (Hs00180634_m1), β-TRCP1 (Hs00182707_m1), Mcl-1 (Hs00172036_m1) and
GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1) primers were purchased from ABI.
Protein Degradation Analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were transfected with Myc-Mcl-1 along with HA-Fbw7, or Flag-β-TRCP1, and GFP as
a negative control, in the presence or absence of HA-GSK3 and/or HA-ERK1. For half-life
studies, cycloheximide (20 µg/ml, Sigma) was added to the media 40 h post-transfection. At
various time points thereafter, cells were lysed and protein abundances were measured by
immunoblot analysis.
In vivo Ubiquitination Assay

Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Flag-Ubiquitin along with Myc-Mcl-1 and
HA-Fbw7 in the presence or absence of HA-GSK3. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells
were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (30 µM, Calbiochem) for 6 hours, and
then harvested. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were recovered and immunoblotted with the
anti-Flag antibody. Alternatively, cells were transfected with His-Ubiquitin along with MycMcl-1 and HA-Fbw7 in the presence or absence of HA-GSK3. Thirty-six hours after
transfection, cells were harvested, and the lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA matrices
(Qiagen) at 4 °C for 12 h in the presence of 8 M Urea pH 7.5. Immobilized proteins were
washed five times with 8 M Urea pH 6.3 before being resolved by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with the anti-Myc antibody.

In vitro Ubiquitination Assay

Author Manuscript

The in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed as described previously 8. To purify the
SCFFbw7 E3 ligase complex, 293T cells were transfected with vectors encoding GST-Fbw7,
HA-Cullin-1, Myc-Skp1 and Flag-Rbx1. The SCFFbw7 E3 complexes were purified from the
whole cell lysates using GST-agarose beads. Purified, recombinant GST-Mcl-1 proteins
were incubated with purified SCFFbw7 complexes in the presence of purified, recombinant
active E1, E2 (UbcH5a and UbcH3), ATP and ubiquitin. The reactions were stopped by the
addition of 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer and the reaction products were resolved by SDSPAGE gel and probed with the indicated antibodies.
In vitro Kinase Assay

Author Manuscript

GSK-3 was purchased from New England Biolabs. The in vitro kinase reaction was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5 µg of the indicated GST
fusion proteins were incubated with purified active GSK3 in the presence of 5 µCi [γ-32P]
ATP and 20 µM cold ATP in the kinase reaction buffer for 20 min. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of SDS-containing lysis buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and
detected by autoradiography.
Mcl-1 Binding Assays
Binding to immobilized GST proteins was performed as described previously 28. Where
indicated, the GST-Mcl-1 proteins were incubated with GSK3 in the presence of ATP for 1
h prior to the binding assays.
Subcellular Fractionation

Author Manuscript

Mitochondrial and cytosolic (S100) fractions were prepared by resuspending HeLa cells in
0.8 ml ice-cold buffer A (250 mM sucrose, 20mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 17 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8
µg/ml aprotinin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin). Cells were then passed through an ice-cold cylinder cell
homogenizer. Unlysed cells and nuclei were pelleted through a 10 min, 750 g spin. The
recovered supernatant was spun at 10,000 g for 25 min. This pellet was resuspended in
buffer A and represents the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was spun at 100,000 g
for 1 hr. The supernatant from this final centrifugation represents the S100 (cytosolic)
fraction.
Mice

Author Manuscript

Generation of conditional Fbw7 knockout mice (Lck-Cre/Fbw7fl/fl and Mx1-Cre/Fbw7fl/fl)
was described previously 3, 4.
In vivo imaging—CMLT1 cells were infected with lentiviral vectors encoding a shRNA
against Mcl-1 (shMcl-1) or an irrelevant control (shGFP). After selection in puromycin 1
µg/ml, cells were engineered for in vivo imaging by transduction with a retrovirus encoding
a fusion of firefly luciferase fused to neomycin phosphotransferase, and then selected with
G418 at 0.5 mg/ml. After selection, the luciferase activity of each engineered cell line was
measured and found to have similar reading. Subsequently, equal numbers of viable cells

(0.5–1 × 107 cells) were injected into NSG mice via the lateral tail vein. Tumor burden was
determined using bioluminescence imaging (IVIS Spectrum, Caliper Life Sciences) after
intraperitoneal injection of D-Luciferin 75 mg/kg. Total body luminescence was quantified
using the Living Images software package (Caliper Life Sciences), and are expressed as
photons/second/standardized region of interest (ph/s/ROI) encompassing the entire mouse.
Data represented as mean ± SEM with statistical significance determined by Student’s t-test.
