ABSTRACT
In addition to genetic alterations, cancer cells are characterized by myriad
epigenetic changes. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that is over-expressed
and mutated in cancer. The EZH2 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations first identified
in lymphomas have recently been reported in melanoma (~2%) but remain
uncharacterized. We expressed multiple EZH2 GOF mutations in the A375 metastatic
skin melanoma cell line and observed both increased H3K27me3 and dramatic
changes in 3D culture morphology. In these cells, prominent morphological changes
were accompanied by a decrease in cell contractility and an increase in collective cell
migration. At the molecular level, we observed significant alteration of the axonal
guidance pathway, a pathway intricately involved in the regulation of cell shape
and motility. Furthermore, the aggressive 3D morphology of EZH2 GOF-expressing
melanoma cells (both endogenous and ectopic) was attenuated by EZH2 catalytic
inhibition. Finally, A375 cells expressing exogenous EZH2 GOF mutants formed larger
tumors than control cells in mouse xenograft studies. This study not only demonstrates
the first functional characterization of EZH2 GOF mutants in non-hematopoietic cells,
but also provides a rationale for EZH2 catalytic inhibition in melanoma.

strongly correlates with gene repression [3]. During
development, EZH2 acts within Polycomb Repressor
Complex 2 (PRC2) to suppress developmental regulators
(e.g. Hox proteins) and thus plays a role in establishing
cellular identity [4]. In cancer, EZH2 is over-expressed
in multiple tumor types including lung, prostate, breast,
colon, bladder, and pancreatic cancer, as well as sarcoma,
lymphoma, and melanoma. EZH2 expression often
correlates with tumor aggressiveness and serves as an
independent prognostic indicator of survival in lung,
prostate, ovarian, breast and renal cell carcinomas [5–7].

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a disease characterized by both genetic
and epigenetic changes that disrupt tumor-suppressive
pathways and activate tumor-promoting pathways.
Perturbations of both DNA methylation and histone
modification patterns resulting from mutations and altered
expression of DNA and histone modifying enzymes have
been observed in a wide variety of cancers [1, 2].
EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that methylates
(mono, di or tri) Lysine 27 of Histone H3, a mark that

In addition, hotspot mutations that activate EZH2 (e.g. Y641,
A677, A687) have now been identified in hematological
tumor types (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (up to 25%)) [8, 9].
The Y641 GOF mutations occur in a heterozygous
fashion and alter the substrate specificity of EZH2 to
dimethylated H3K27, thereby resulting in massive
accumulation of H3K27me3 and depletion of H3K27me2
[10, 11]. Importantly, GOF mutations render DLBCL cell
lines exquisitely sensitive to catalytic inhibition of EZH2
activity, suggesting that EZH2 activity is crucial for these
tumor types and opening up the possibility of EZH2 inhibitorbased therapy for patients with these mutations [12–14].
Recently, a comprehensive analysis of driver mutations in
melanoma has revealed the presence of EZH2 GOF mutations
(2%) within this disease setting [15]. The role played by
EZH2 GOF mutations in non-hematopoietic cells, and in
particular melanoma cells, is completely uncharacterized.
Studying the action of EZH2 GOF mutations in nonhematopoietic cells will allow both a greater understanding of
EZH2 catalytic activity in solid tumors, as well as define and
potentially expand the subset of patients who would benefit
from EZH2-based therapies. In this study, we have utilized
both ectopic expression of EZH2 GOF mutations and a small
molecule inhibitor of EZH2 to gain insight into the function
of EZH2 and EZH2 GOF mutants in solid tumor biology
with a particular focus on melanoma.

(Figure 1A). As reported, mutant-EZH2 DLBCL cells
(Karpas-422 (lane 5), WSU-DL-CL2 (lane 6)) displayed
increased H3K27me3 and depleted H3K27me2 compared
to a WT-EZH2 DLBCL cell line (OCI-LY19 (lane 4)).
Accordingly, the IGR1 melanoma cell line (lane 3) that
contains an endogenous EZH2 Y641N mutation displayed
a similar pattern of H3K27 modification compared to two
WT-EZH2 skin cancer cell lines (A431 skin SCC (lane 1),
A375 melanoma cells (lane 2)).
To evaluate the role of EZH2 GOF mutations, we
introduced EZH2-expressing lentiviral constructs into
two distinct cell models: A375 cells and BEAS-2B cells.
A375 is a malignant skin melanoma cell line that harbors
an activating BRAF mutation and was chosen based on the
observation that EZH2 GOF mutations have been shown
to occur concurrently with BRAF mutations in melanoma
[16]. For comparison, a non-transformed epithelial cell line
was utilized to assess the role of EZH2 GOF mutants in
a normal genetic background. The western blot in Figure
1B shows that only EZH2 GOF mutants (Y641F, Y641N),
but not EZH2 WT or a catalytically-inactive EZH2 point
mutant (Y726D), caused increased H3K27me3 with
subsequent decrease in H3K27me2 in both BEAS-2B and
A375 cells. Importantly, this pattern of histone modification
caused by ectopic EZH2 GOF mutants mirrors the pattern
of cells with endogenous EZH2 mutations.
We next assessed the phenotypes that were
associated with EZH2 GOF-dependent epigenetic
reprogramming in the disease relevant A375 model.
Despite the fact that GOF mutations are selected for
within melanoma, the expression of EZH2 GOF mutants
(Y641F, Y641N) gave no growth advantage to A375
cells grown under standard tissue culture conditions
(Supplemental Figure S1A). Furthermore, there were

RESULTS
To assess the impact of EZH2 GOF mutants on
global levels of H3K27 modification, we performed
western blotting from several cell lines that harbor
endogenous EZH2 WT or EZH2 GOF mutants

no obvious changes to cell morphology in 2D culture
(Supplemental Figure S1B). However, a clear phenotype
became evident upon growing the cells in 3D culture.
Strikingly, EZH2 GOF mutant-expressing cells seeded
upon a thick layer of extracellular matrix (ECM)
displayed prominent branching morphology compared to
control cells (Vector), EZH2 WT and Y726D expressing
cells (Figure 1C). EZH2 GOF-expressing cells embedded
within ECM also showed a similar disruption of
spheroid formation and aggressive growth morphology
(Supplemental Figure S2A).
Upon observing these striking morphological
changes, we asked whether these changes were specific
to the expression of EZH2 Y641 mutants (the only GOF
mutants observed thus far in melanoma), or whether
enhancement of H3K27me3 levels in general could also
give rise to these phenotypes. Therefore, we expressed
two lymphoma-specific EZH2 GOF mutants, A677G
and A687V, in A375 cells. Of note, these mutations have
different substrate preferences compared to Y641 mutants
(Supplemental Figure S2B, top panel). Nonetheless, the
expression of both lymphoma-derived GOF mutants gave
rise to increased global H3K27me3, but had distinct effects
on H3K27me2 depletion. Despite its increased activity on
H3K27me1 (with little gain in activity for H3K27me2),
the observation that EZH2 A687V can drive conversion
of H3K27me2 to H3K27me3 is in line with previous
reports that have both predicted [17] and demonstrated this
ability in cancer cell lines [18]. Despite the fundamental
differences between these EZH2 GOF mutants, all GOF
mutants gave rise to dramatic branching morphologies of
A375 cells in 3D culture, thus strengthening the correlation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

between this phenotype and underlying epigenetic
reprogramming (Supplemental Figure S2C).
While the images of cells grown in 3D-culture
clearly demonstrate differences in cell morphology
between control and EZH2 GOF-expressing cells,
time-lapse imaging of these cells provides a more indepth analysis of the behavior of such cells. A375 cells
expressing an empty vector, EZH2 WT, EZH2 Y641F,
EZH2 Y641N or EZH2 Y726D were cultured on top of
ECM and images were recorded over a 96-hour period
(Supplemental movie files 1–5). These data revealed that
EZH2 GOF-expressing cells display enhanced motility
compared to control cells, forming highly dynamic
collective migrating chains instead of spheroid-like
clusters that remained relatively stationary. Therefore,
collective migration underlies the static branching
morphology observed in EZH2 GOF-expressing cells
shown in Figure 1.
To assess the generality of our findings, we
expressed EZH2 WT or Y641F in non-transformed
BEAS-2B cells and evaluated the resultant phenotypes.
In this model, we observed that both EZH2 WT and
Y641F disrupted the formation of spheroids typical of
normal epithelium embedded within ECM (Supplemental
Figure S3A). Notably, both EZH2 WT and Y641F also
caused hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT)
transition. MosaiX image capture analysis (Supplemental
Figure S3A, bottom panel, tiled images) revealed
that control cells (Vector) formed E-cadherin positive
spheroids that were disrupted by EZH2 WT and Y641F.
Strikingly, EZH2 Y641F caused prominent branching
growth of cells that stained positive for the mesenchymal

marker Vimentin. Accordingly, both EZH2 WT and Y641F
shifted the balance of the classic EMT markers E-Cadherin
and Vimentin as well as other genes associated with this
transition (Supplemental Figure S3B).
To identify the changes associated with the
phenotypes described above, we performed microarray
analysis on the BEAS-2B stable cell lines (Normalized
expression values can be found in Supplemental Table 
S1). While EZH2 Y641F repressed a greater number of
genes than EZH2 WT (Supplemental Figure S3C, note
that numbers represent qualifiers), gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) suggested that the both EZH2 WT and
Y641F repressed genes from similar functional categories
(Supplemental Figure S3D). In addition, the function
of these gene sets corresponds well with the observed
phenotypes. For example, EZH2 WT and Y641F both
regulated gene sets associated with E-Cadherin (CDH1)
and metastasis.
While the 3D culture morphology changes caused
by EZH2 in BEAS-2B epithelial cells can be attributed to
the prominent EMT signature (including suppression of
the master regulator E-Cadherin), A375 melanoma cells
express very little to undetectable levels of E-Cadherin
(not shown). While melanocytes are not of an epithelial
cell lineage, they do express E-Cadherin in order to
maintain contact with keratinocytes in the basal layer of
the epidermis. In contrast, E-Cadherin is down-regulated
in invasive or malignant melanoma cells (e.g. A375 cells)
[19]. Therefore, we wished to understand how EZH2 GOF
mutants caused branching morphogenesis and altered
cell motility in the A375 cell model. We hypothesized
that downstream regulation of the actin cytoskeleton had
been altered in these cells. To understand these changes,
we assessed the phosphorylation status of myosin light
chain 2 (MLC2), a mark that correlates with myosin
ATPase activity and contractility [20]. The western blot in
Figure 2A demonstrates that phosphorylated myosin light
chain 2 (pMLC) was greatly diminished in EZH2 GOFexpressing cells that had been cultured on a thick layer
of ECM, but not under standard tissue culture conditions.
Since pMLC is a marker of active Rho-associated protein
kinase (ROCK), we treated A375 cells with Y-27632
(a well-characterized small molecule inhibitor of ROCK)
to understand how ROCK activity may contribute to
the observed phenotypes (Figure 2B). As in Figure 2A,
pMLC levels were decreased by Y641F and Y641N
GOF mutants. Expectedly, pMLC levels were efficiently
depleted by treatment with the ROCK inhibitor. Two
days after these cells were seeded onto ECM, ROCKinhibited control cells displayed morphology and motility
that was similar to EZH2 GOF-expressing cells (Figure
2B and Supplemental movie file 6). At later time-points,
however, both ROCK inhibitor-treated Vector and EZH2
GOF cells formed extremely large cell clusters devoid of
distinct branching structures (Supplemental Figure S4).
Together these data suggest that while suppression of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ROCK activity by EZH2 GOF mutants contributes to the
observed 3D-morphology, this phenomenon is likely to
require complex cellular organization that involves precise
spatiotemporal regulation of signaling pathways.
We next wished to understand whether the changes
in 3D morphology/motility caused by EZH2 GOF mutants
were permanent or if they could be reversed by inhibition
of EZH2. To address this question, we treated control
and GOF-expressing cells with a previously published
small molecule inhibitor of EZH2, GSK126 [12]. This
treatment caused partial abrogation of the branching
morphology of GOF expressing cells, restoring the
spheroid-like morphology displayed by control cells
(Figure 2C). Notably, at this time-point there were only
minor effects of this inhibitor on control cells. (However,
at later time-points control cells were also affected by
EZH2 catalytic inhibition, Supplemental Figure S5A).
Importantly, the EZH2 inhibitor caused robust downregulation of H3K27me3, confirming the importance
of EZH2 catalytic activity to 3D morphology changes.
Furthermore, inhibition of the catalytic activity of EZH2
GOF mutants partially rescued pMLC levels, indicating
that actin-myosin contractility was restored under these
conditions (Figure 2D).
To assess the therapeutic implications of our findings
in the A375 model, we next extended our studies to the
IGR1 melanoma cell line that contains an endogenous
EZH2 GOF mutation (Y641N, see Figure 1A). Treatment
of these cells with the EZH2 inhibitor decreased global
H3K27me3 levels, but did not affect 2D cell growth up
to a concentration of 2.5 μM, and had only minor effects
on proliferation at 5 μM (Figure 3A). Remarkably, at
concentrations that do not affect 2D cell growth, EZH2
catalytic inhibition caused significant changes in the
3D-morpholgy of IGR1 cells seeded upon a thick layer
of ECM. Control cells (DMSO-treated) distributed evenly
on the ECM, while EZH2 inhibitor-treated cells formed
dense structures with little connectivity to neighboring
cell clusters. Intriguingly, we also observed up-regulation
of E-Cadherin in EZH2 inhibitor-treated IGR1 cells
(Supplemental Figure S5B), suggesting that EZH2 may in
regulate EMT in a subset of melanomas.
To further understand the molecular underpinnings
of the phenotypes described above, we assessed global
levels of mRNA expression by performing RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) from the following cell lines
cultured on ECM: A375 Vector (control), A375 EZH2 WT,
A375 Y726D (LOF), A375 Y641F (GOF), A375 Y641N
(GOF), A375 A677G (GOF). To determine the impact of
EZH2 catalytic inhibition on target gene expression, we
also performed RNA-seq from A375 Y641F −/+ EZH2
inhibitor and IGR1 cells −/+ EZH2 inhibitor (FPKM
values for the A375 and IGR1 RNA-seq can be found
in Supplemental Table S2). Concordant with observed
phenotypes in A375 cells, hierarchical clustering analysis
showed that EZH2 GOF mutants had similar mRNA

expression profiles that were distinct from control cells,
EZH2 WT-expressing cells and EZH2 Y726D (LOF)expressing cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, the gene
expression pattern of inhibitor-treated EZH2 Y641F cells
clustered together with control cells, suggesting that genes
initially repressed by EZH2 Y641F were re-activated upon
EZH2 catalytic inhibition. We looked at this phenomenon
in greater detail by performing GSEA. This analysis
revealed that compared to control cells, EZH2 Y641F
down-regulated gene sets that have been previously found
associated with H3K27me3 promoter modification. These
gene sets were also de-repressed by catalytic inhibition of
EZH2 (Figure 4B).

Next, we utilized Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) to understand the functional cellular networks
impacted by EZH2 GOF expression (Figure 5A). The
axonal guidance pathway represents one such pathway
that was commonly regulated by all three GOF mutants
with high statistical significance. This functional category
contains well-characterized gene families (e.g. Ephrins,
Semaphorins, etc.) that direct neurite outgrowth or
retraction (Supplemental Figure S6A). IPA analysis of both
EZH2 inhibitor-treated IGR1 cells and A375 EZH2 Y641F
cells also revealed EZH2-dependent regulation of genes
involved in axonal guidance (as well as Ephrin receptor
signaling), suggesting that the A375 GOF-expressing cells

recapitulate endogenous functions of EZH2 GOF mutations
in melanoma. Intriguingly, many of the suppressed genes
are thought to provide repulsive signals to migrating
neurons. In addition, the expression of cell surface adhesion
receptors and proteases involved in axonal guidance
were also regulated by EZH2 GOF mutants. We selected
several such genes for confirmation by qRT-PCR analysis
(Figure 5B, Supplemental Figure S6B).
A comprehensive view of the in vitro data presented
in this manuscript point toward a model in which EZH2
GOF mutants alter both ECM adhesion and actin dynamics
to promote branching morphology and collective
migration in 3D culture (Figure 5C). Specifically,
EZH2 GOF mutants repress axonal guidance genes and
other gene sets (e.g. cell surface adhesion receptors and
proteases) and alter the way in which these cells interact
with the ECM and with themselves. These changes likely
lead to differential intracellular signaling such as the
inactivation of ROCK, thereby curbing its ability to cause
contractility and neurite retraction.
Finally, we wished to understand the contribution of
these changes to in vivo tumor growth. We subcutaneously
implanted 1 x 106 A375 Vector (control), A375 EZH2
WT, A375 Y726D (LOF), A375 Y641F (GOF), A375
Y641N (GOF), or A375 A677G (GOF) cells into nude
mice. Tumor volume was recorded over a period of 17
days. As shown in Figure 6A, A375 control xenografts
grew rapidly, achieving a mean tumor volume of 608.46
mm3 by day 17. The expression of EZH2 WT or EZH2
Y726D did not impart any significant growth advantage
or disadvantage to A375 xenografts (left panel).
However, all three EZH2 GOF mutants provided a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significant growth advantage to A375 xenografts, as
EZH2 GOF-expressing cells formed tumors with a mean
volume of ~1150 mm3 by day 17 (right panel). Using
immunohistochemistry (IHC), we assessed whether the
epigenetic pattern of H3K27 modification was maintained
in xenografts. Figure 6B demonstrates that EZH2 GOFexpressing cells displayed significantly increased mean
ratios of H3K27me3 to H3K27me2 intensity compared to
control cells. From these studies we conclude that EZH2
GOF mutants maintain enhanced histone methyltranferase
activity in vivo and that this activity correlates with
increased tumor growth.

DISCUSSION
In this study we have examined the putative
functions of EZH2 GOF mutants in both melanoma
cells and non-tumorigenic cells. We have learned that
in both systems EZH2 GOF mutations greatly increased
H3K27me3 levels, down-regulated a multitude of genes
and caused striking 3D morphology changes. In epithelial
cells, we observed an EZH2-induced EMT, a process
associated with increased metastatic potential that has
been previously been linked to EZH2 activity [21–23]. In
this non-tumorigenic model, both EZH2 WT and Y641F
caused morphological changes to cells in 3D culture. In
contrast, we have found that only exogenously expressed
EZH2 GOF mutants, but not EZH2 WT (or LOF), caused
changes to 3D morphology in A375 melanoma cells. Most
importantly, it was this activity (and not proliferation rate)
that correlated with enhanced tumor growth as only EZH2
GOF expressing cells displayed increased A375 tumor size

in xenograft studies. This finding underscores the need
for a deeper understanding of EZH2 function within this
disease setting.
The observation that four distinct EZH2 GOF
mutants, that each lead to increased global H3K27me3,
caused similar 3D morphologies provides compelling
evidence for the specificity and relevance of this
phenotype. The abrogation of branching morphology
by a small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 reaffirms the
importance of EZH2 catalytic activity in this model.
The observation that EZH2 inhibitor-treated IGR1
cells displayed a similar morphological reversion in 3D
culture points toward conserved functions of EZH2 GOF
mutants across melanoma cell lines. Unlike DLBCL cell
lines that harbor endogenous EZH2 GOF mutants, IGR1
cell lines were insensitive to EZH2 catalytic inhibition
in 2D culture. Interestingly, a recent study showed that
ovarian cancer cells were insensitive to EZH2 inhibition
in 2D culture, but sensitive to such treatment in 3D
culture [24]. Taken together, these data suggest that the
EZH2 GOF mutations may not drive intrinsic melanoma
cell proliferation (as do mutations in driver genes like
BRAF), but rather function by shaping the interactions
between melanoma cells and their microenvironment.
In line with this idea, previous clinical data have
demonstrated an association between EZH2 levels
and aggressive features of cutaneous melanoma [25].
Furthermore, as EZH2 mutations in melanoma are
coincident with BRAF mutations they may serve to
complement the function of BRAF (i.e. BRAF signaling
drives cell division, whereas EZH2 signaling drives
motility/migration). Pointing toward collaboration of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these two oncogenes is the observation that knockdown
of BRAFV600E (in A375 cells and other cell models)
leads to down-regulation of EZH2 levels [26]. As such,
the simultaneous inhibition of both BRAF and EZH2
should be considered in treatment of melanoma patients
that harbor these mutations.
RNA-seq analysis from cells cultured in 3D allowed
a thorough understanding of the changes imparted by
EZH2 GOF mutations. The conserved pattern of gene
expression between EZH2 GOF mutants strongly argues
for a common mechanism underlying the observed
phenotypes. Axonal guidance genes represent factors that
control neuronal migration and positioning by providing
short-range (cell surface localization) or long-range
(secreted/diffusible) attractive or repulsive cues [27].
Factors that regulate axonal-guidance include, but are
not limited to, gene families like Ephrins, Semaphorins,
Netrins, SLITs, and ROBOs as well as ECM components,
cell adhesion molecules and cell-surface proteases.
These factors are also thought to be crucial players in the
migration of neural crest-derived melanocytes [28–30].
It is also well-established that signaling through this
pathway converges on the Rho-GTPase family that acts
as a master regulator of neurite outgrowth [31, 32] and
cell motility [33]. For example, Eph-receptor-ephrin bidirectional signaling greatly contributes to regulation
of cell morphology and motility through functional
interactions with Rho GTPases [34, 35].
Therefore, we hypothesize that the coordinate
regulation of this signaling pathway by EZH2 GOF
mutants contributes to the observed collective migration
and branching morphology in A375 melanoma cells. In
2934

Oncotarget

support of this hypothesis, many of the suppressed genes
are thought to be negative regulators of axon-growth. For
example, Ephrin-B3 has been shown to both inhibit neurite
outgrowth and prevent regeneration after injury [36, 37].
Semaphorins can also provide repulsive forces to growing
axons through their interaction with Neuropilin and Plexin
receptors [38]. Similarly, the netrin receptor Unc5B inhibits
both axonal migration as well as sprouting angiogenesis
[39, 40]. Accordingly, axonal guidance genes have also
been linked to the process of tumor angiogenesis [41].
Further implicating the axonal guidance genes
in cancer biology are studies that have shown genetic
alterations and aberrant regulation of these genes in
several tumor types. For example, a recent genomic
analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
identified recurrent mutations and altered copy number
of axonal guidance genes, implying a functional role
in PDAC [42]. In addition, altered expression levels of
axonal guidance genes have been observed in lung, breast
and colorectal cancers, among others [43, 44]. Most
relevant to this study, oncogenic BRAF mutants have been
shown to down-regulate the expression of axonal guidance
genes in melanoma [45]. Finally, many of the genes
down-regulated by EZH2 GOF in this study that modulate
ECM-adhesion/signaling display altered expression or
have been ascribed roles in tumor biology (e.g. NRCAM,
CEACAM1, SORCS1, ADAM23, MME).
Overall this study suggests that the gene expression
changes resulting from EZH2 GOF expression have
altered the interaction between cells and the ECM in two
distinct cell models representing both non-tumorigenic and
tumorigenic settings. Specifically in melanoma, we have
delineated a novel pathway regulated by both ectopically
and endogenously expressed EZH2 GOF mutants: the
axonal guidance pathway. The 3D-culutre phenotypes
that we have observed are likely caused by the cumulative
effect of EZH2 GOF-dependent epigenetic reprogramming
that results in the altered expression of multiple genes in
this pathway (axonal guidance) as well as other pathways
(adhesion, protease activity, etc.). Consequently, the
alterations to these pathways have impacted intracellular
signaling pathways, exemplified here by ROCK activity,
that control cell motility and morphology. Though future
studies will be needed to assess the metastatic capabilities
of EZH2 GOF expressing cells, these cells indeed formed
larger tumors than control cells in xenograft models. As
these mutations do not enhance 2D-growth rate and the
A375 melanoma cell line is a model that already grows
rapidly in vivo, these surprising findings suggest that
EZH2 GOF mutants likely impart properties to these cells
that go beyond driving proliferation. Taken together, the
data presented in this study strongly suggest that EZH2
GOF mutants contribute to melanoma progression by
altering the way in which melanoma cells interface with
their surrounding microenvironment and in this manner
may confer a growth advantage to tumors bearing these

mutations. This study supports an important role for EZH2
catalytic activity in melanoma and warrants further study
of the utility of EZH2 inhibitors within this disease setting.

METHODS
Cell culture
Two suppliers of ECM were used: BD biosciences
(RGF MatrigelTM, 356231) or Life Technologies
(GeltrexTM, A1413302). To perform 3D culture
experiments, 300 μl of ECM was used to coat one well of a
24-well plate and cells were seeded on top. For embedded
3D-culture experiments, cells were suspended in 100%
ECM and plated into a 24-well plate. To obtain cell
lysates from 3D culture experiments, the Cultrex® 3D-cell
harvesting kit from Trevigen was utilized (3448–020-K).
The GSK126 EZH2 inhibitor was obtained from Xcessbio
(M60071) and used at a concentration of 1 μM unless
otherwise noted. For 3D culture experiments involving the
EZH2 inhibitor, cells were pre-treated in 2D for seven days
prior to plating in 3D culture (and re-treated at the time of
plating). The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 was obtained from
Sigma (Y0503) and was used at a concentration of 10 μM.
For 3D culture experiments, this compound was added as
cells were seeded onto the ECM.

Microscopy
For imaging, an Olympus IX51 inverted microscope
and DP71 camera was utilized.

Western blotting
Antibodies: EZH2 (Cell Signaling Technology
3147), Actin (MAB1501), Total Histone H3 (Cell
Signaling Technology 3638), H3K27me3 (Cell
Signaling Technology 9733), H3K27me2 (Cell Signaling
Technology 9728), MLC2 (Cell Signaling Technology
3672), pMLC2 (ser 19) (Cell Signaling Technology 3671),
E-Cadherin (BD Biosciences 610182), and Vimentin
(Epitomics 4211–1).

qRT-PCR
The Qiagen RNeasy® kit (74106) and Qiagen
Quantitect® Reverse Transcription kits (205311) were
used to generate cDNA used in qPCR reactions (Applied
Biosystems® ViiA 7TM real-time cycler) in conjunction
with Taqman gene expression master mix (4369016) and
TaqMan gene expression assays.

BEAS-2B gene expression profiling
BEAS-2B stable cells were seeded into 6-well
plates in triplicate and 72 post-plating RNA was isolated
using the Qiagen RNeasy® kit (74106). RNA was labeled
