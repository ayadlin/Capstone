ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been implicated in multiple malignant tumors,
and HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) exert anti-cancer effects. However, the expression of
HDACs and the anti-tumor mechanism of HDACIs in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have
not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that expression of HDACs 2, 3, and 8
were up-regulated in CCA tissues and those patients with high expression of HDAC2
and/or HDAC3 had a worse prognosis. In CCA cells, two HDACIs, trichostatin (TSA)
and vorinostat (SAHA), suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis and G2/M
cycle arrest. Microarray analysis revealed that TACC3 mRNA was down-regulated in
CCA cells treated with TSA. TACC3 was highly expressed in CCA tissues and predicted
a poor prognosis in CCA patients. TACC3 knockdown induced G2/M cycle arrest and
suppressed the invasion, metastasis, and proliferation of CCA cells, both in vitro and
in vivo. TACC3 overexpression reversed the effects of its knockdown. These findings
suggest TACC3 may be a useful prognostic biomarker for CCA and is a potential
therapeutic target for HDACIs.

Tumor development requires both genetic and
epigenetic alterations, which include DNA methylation,
histone modifications, and gene silencing by small RNAs
[6]. Acetylation of the N-terminal tail of core histones is
tightly controlled by the antagonistic actions of histone
acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases
(HDACs) [7]. HDACs remove acetyl groups from
the lysine residues of histones, increasing the ionic
interactions between DNA and histones, and resulting in
chromatin condensation that represses transcription [8, 9].
As a consequence, excessive deacetylation of histones
induces cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell migration,
and invasion by inactivating tumor suppressor genes
[10]. There are eighteen HDAC isoforms categorized
into four classes. Class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3 and
8) are the best characterized and are related to the yeast
RPD3 deacetylase. Class II HDACs are subdivided into
class IIa (HDACs 4, 5, 7 and 9) and class IIb HDACs

INTRODUCTION
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) originates from the
epithelial cells of the intra- and extra-hepatic biliary trees
and is the second most common hepatobiliary malignancy
after hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. Morbidity due to CCA
has been rising worldwide over the past several decades [2].
Due to the strong and early invasive characteristics of CCA,
most patients are diagnosed in the later stages of disease. In
addition, more than two-thirds of patients are ineligible for
surgery, the only potential curative option. Unfortunately,
even radical resection is associated with a high rate of
recurrence that results in a five-year survival rate of less
than 20-40%. Most CCA patients resort to palliative
treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with a
response of only 10-20% [3–5]. Therefore, it is crucial to
find new therapeutic strategies and an effective prognostic
biomarker for patients with CCA.

(HDACs 6 and 10), which are homologous to the yeast
Hda1 deacetylase. Class III HDACs (sirtuins [SIRTs])
include the seven subtypes of SIRTs (SIRTs 1-7), while
class IV HDACs only includes HDAC11 [11–13]. Many
studies have reported on the differential expression of
class I and II HDAC isoforms in a variety of malignancies
and cell lines, such as lymphoma [14], breast [15], gastric
[16], colorectal [17], and lung cancers [18], hepatocellular
carcinoma [19], as well as cholangiocarcinoma
[20]. Despite the fact that class I and II HDACs are
overexpressed in a variety of CCA cell lines, few studies
have examined HDAC expression status and its prognostic
value in CCA patients [20].
A multitude of natural and synthetic compounds
function as HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) that weaken
histone-DNA interactions permitting a more open
chromatin conformation and enhancing gene transcription.
HDACIs as cancer treatments lead to increased
transcription of tumor suppressor genes, the induction of
cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, and the
inhibition of angiogenesis [21, 22]. HDACIs have been
classified into four groups according to their chemistry:
hydroxamates (trichostatin [TSA] and vorinostat
[SAHA]), cyclic peptides (romidepsin), aliphatic acids,
and benzamides [21, 23]. Out of all of the HDACIs,
SAHA has shown the most promising antitumor effects
on tumor types at doses that are well-tolerated by patients
and was the first HDACI approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma [24]. TSA is a pan-HDACI and was the
first natural hydroxamate found to inhibit cell proliferation
and induce apoptosis in many cancer cell lines, such as
breast cancer, lung cancer, and CCA cells [20, 21, 25].
Despite the broad application of HDACIs in cell culture,
animal models, and early phase clinical trials, surprisingly
little is known about specific anti-tumor mechanism of
HDACIs in CCA.
Transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein
3 (TACC3), a member of the TACC family, is encoded by
the TACC3 gene, which is located on 4p16.3. TACC3 is a
centrosome/microtubule-associated protein characterized
by a highly conserved C-terminal coiled-coil domain
[26, 27]. TACC3 regulates centrosome integrity and
microtubule dynamics during mitosis, and has recently
been shown to modulate epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) through the activation of the PI3K/
Akt and ERK signaling pathways in cervical cancer cells
[28, 29]. TACC3 is also involved in the development of
glioblastoma [30], multiple myeloma [31], lung cancer
[32] and breast cancer [33], while TACC3 expression is
decreased in thyroid and ovarian cancers [34, 35]. The
function of TACC3 and its relationship with HDACIs in
CCA is unknown.
In the present study, we first investigated the
expression of class I and II HDACs in CCA tissues,
and then, assessed the correlation of HDAC expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with CCA patient clinicopathological characteristics.
We then demonstrated that TSA and SAHA inhibited
cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest in CCA cell lines. In addition, through a
microarray experiment, we found that TACC3 expression
was down-regulated when cells were treated with
HDACIs. Expression of TACC3 and its correlation
with the clinicopathological features of CCA were also
investigated. Moreover, the functions of TACC3 were
assessed by RNA knockdown and rescue experiments,
in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that HDAC2,
HDAC3, and TACC3 are highly expressed in CCA tissues
and that their expression correlates with poor prognosis in
CCA patients. Thus, TACC3 may be a target of HDACIs,
which inhibit the proliferation and migration of CCA cells.

RESULTS
High expression of HDAC2 and HDAC3
promotes tumor progression and correlates with
poor prognosis
The expression of class I and class II HDAC
mRNAs was assayed with qRT-PCR in 26 paired CCA
and adjacent non-tumor fresh tissue samples. Among
HDACs 1-10, class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3,
and HDAC8) and HDAC9 were more highly expressed
in CCA tissues compared with paired non-tumor tissues
(P<0.05; Figure 1A). HDAC protein expression was
then assayed by Western blot (WB), and the expression
of HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 were higher in CCA
tissues compared with paired non-tumor tissues (P<0.05;
Figure 1B). We selected HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8
to further examine in 79 paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffinembedded paired CCA and adjacent non-tumor tissues
with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Expression of all three
HDACs was localized to the nucleus (Figure 1C), and high
expression of HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8 was observed
in 42 (53.16%), 44 (55.69%), and 42 (53.16%) CCA cases,
respectively. CCA tissues had higher expression compared
with corresponding matched non-tumor tissues (27.85%,
30.38%, and 32.91% for HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8,
respectively; χ2 =10.505, 10.327, 6.609; P<0.05; Table 1).
Furthermore, high expression of HDAC2 and HDAC3
was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis
(χ2 =15.474; 9.757) (P<0.001, P=0.002), TNM stage (χ2
=13.021; 7.693) (P<0.001, P=0.006), and differentiation
(χ2 =9.125; 8.313) (P=0.003; P=0.004) in CCA;
however, no such correlations were observed for HDAC8
(P>0.05; Table 1). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that
patients with low expression of HDAC2 and/or HDAC3
exhibited a longer overall survival (OS) than those with
high expression of HDAC2 and/or HDAC3 (P<0.001,
Figure 1D), but no correlation with OS was observed for
HDAC8. Moreover, multivariate COX regression analyses
identified HDAC2 and HDAC3 as significant, independent

was used as a negative control). Both TSA and SAHA
suppressed cell proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner in CCA cells (Figure 2A). At 48 hours, the IC50
of TSA was 0.3075 μM for TFK-1 cells and 0.4718 μM
for HuCCT-1 cells, while the IC50 of SAHA was 3.257
μM for TFK-1 cells and 4.603 μM for HuCCT-1 cells.
Moreover, when TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells were treated
with TSA and SAHA at their respective IC50 doses for 48
hours, the rate of apoptosis was higher than that of the
DMSO-treated cells (P<0.05, Figure 2B). Additionally,
both drugs induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in both CCA
cell lines (P<0.05, Figure 2C), and the percentage of
TFK-1 cells in G1 phase was also markedly decreased

G2/M phase checkpoint proteins, including CDK1 and
cyclin B1, was down-regulated after treatment with TSA
or SAHA (P<0.05, Figure 2D). To detect the impact of
HDACIs on EMT, we also examined the expression of
the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and the mesenchymal
marker, vimentin. Elevated expression of E-cadherin and
reduced expression of vimentin were detected at both the
mRNA and protein level after TSA and SAHA treatment.
In addition, the expression of HDAC2 and HDAC3
were down-regulated (P<0.05, Figure 2E). These results
indicated that HDAC2 and HDAC3 might restrain EMT
in CCA cells.

To investigate whether TACC3 expression is
correlated with CCA progression, we analyzed its
association with the clinicopathological characteristics
of CCA specimens. As shown in Table 1, there was a
strong correlation between high TACC3 expression and
lymph node status (P=0.003), TNM stage (P<0.001), and
differentiation (P<0.001), but not with age (P=0.259)
or gender (P=0.238). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested
that OS was shorter for patients with high TACC3
expression than for those with low TACC3 expression
(P<0.001; Figure 3E). Furthermore, TACC3 expression
was correlated with OS in patients with stage I-II disease
(n=45; P=0.0077; Figure 3E), but not in patients with
stage III-IV disease (n=34; P=0.2454; Figure 3E).
Additionally, multivariate analysis showed that TACC3
expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS
in patients with CCA (95%CI: 1.503–3.1670; P=0.0063;
Table 2).

Identification of TACC3 as a molecular drug
target of HDAC inhibitors and its correlation
with poor prognosis in CCA patients
To identify the target transcripts of HDACIs,
mRNA expression profiles of TFK-1 cells treated with
TSA at the IC50 dose for 48 hours, were measured via
microarray analysis. TFK-1 cells treated with 1% DMSO
were used as a negative controls. The microarray data
have been stored in the NCBI GEO repository and
are accessible through the following GEO accession
number: GSE78867 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78867). In total, there were 1568
up-regulated genes and 1448 down-regulated genes
identified. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia
of genes and genomes (KEGG) software was used to
identify genes involved in cell proliferation and migration,
leaving 163 genes as shown in the hierarchical clustering
graph (Figure 3A). Among these genes, TACC3 mRNA
was markedly down-regulated (Fold Change=6.317668;
P<0.0001) after TSA treatment. To validate these findings,
TACC3 mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in
CCA cell lines treated with TSA or SAHA. The qRT-PCR
results confirmed that TACC3 mRNA was down-regulated
after treatment with HDACIs (P<0.05; Figure 3B).
Next, we investigated the expression of TACC3 protein
in CCA cell lines by WB. TACC3 was also down-regulated
after cells were treated with HDACIs (P<0.05; Figure 3B),
but TSA more effectively down-regulated TACC3 expression
than SAHA in CCA cells. These findings were investigated
further with qRT-PCR and WB in 26 pairs of CCA tissues
and non-tumor tissues. We found that TACC3 expression was
higher in CCA tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues at
both the mRNA and protein levels (P<0.05; Figure 3C). IHC
studies on 79 paraffin-embedded CCA specimens indicated
that TACC3 was localized to the cytoplasm of CCA cells
(Figure 3D). The expression of TACC3 in CCA tissues
was higher than in the paired adjacent non-tumor tissues
(P=0.008; Table 1). These findings strongly suggested that
TACC3 was down-regulated after treatment with HDACIs
and up-regulated in CCA tissues compared with adjacent
non-tumor tissues, and that TACC3 may be a potential antitumor molecular drug target of HDACIs in CCA.

Knockdown of TACC3 suppresses the
proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of
CCA cells
To investigate the potential roles of TACC3 in CCA
tumorigenesis, we stably knocked down TACC3 in TFK1 and HuCCT-1 cells with lentiviral transfection of two
TACC3 shRNA duplexes. For the rescue experiment,
lentiviruses carrying TACC3 cDNA were re-transfected
into the cells with TACC3 shRNA or transfected into TSAtreated cells. qRT-PCR, WB, and immunofluorescence (IF)
analyses confirmed that TACC3 expression was downregulated in cells treated with TSA or TACC3 shRNA
(P<0.05; Figure 4A&4B), while the expression of TACC3
was rescued in cells transfected with TACC3 cDNA
(P<0.05; Figure 4A&4B). Compared with the blank and
negative control (NC) groups, TSA treatment and TACC3
shRNA treatment resulted in markedly lower cell viability
(P<0.05; Figure 4C). TSA treatment reduced the number
of colonies formed compared with the NC group (TFK-1:
44±16.5 vs 276±25.1 cells per well, P<0.001; HuCCT-1:
52.7±21.9 vs 243.3±32.2 cells per well, P<0.001), and
when TSA-treated cells were transfected with TACC3
cDNA, the number of colonies formed was increased
compared with TSA treatment (TFK-1: 130.7±43.6 vs
44±16.5 cells per well, P<0.05; HuCCT-1: 120.5±27.2
vs 52.7±21.9 cells per well, P<0.05). Similarly, there
was a decrease in the number of colonies formed in cells
with TACC3 shRNA knockdown compared with the NC
group (TFK-1: 29.3±10.1 & 30±17.6 vs 276±25.1 cells
per well, P<0.001; HuCCT-1: 23.3±15.3 & 49.7±17.9 vs
243.3±32.2 cells per well, P<0.001), while TACC3 shRNA
cells given TACC3 cDNA had increased colony formation
(TFK-1: 29.3±10.1 & 30±17.6 vs 150±36.1 cells per well,
P<0.05 ; HuCCT-1: 24.3±15.3 & 49.7±17.9 vs 153.3±41.6
cells per well, P<0.05, Figure 4D). These results indicated
a growth-promoting role of TACC3 in CCA cells.

To explore the effects of TACC3 on the cell cycle,
FACS was used to assess cell cycle distributions following
TACC3 silencing or overexpression. Knockdown of TACC3
promoted G2/M arrest (P<0.05, Figure 5A), whereas G1/S
transition was suppressed in TFK-1 and HuCCT-1 cells.
In addition, when TACC3 knockdown cells were given
TACC3 cDNA, the G2/M phase distribution was decreased

(P<0.05, Figure 5A). Moreover, the expression of G2/M

expression (P<0.05; Figure 5E). Expression of HDAC2 and
HDAC3, which correlated with lymphatic metastasis and
prognosis in CCA patients, were also decreased (P<0.05;
Figure 5E). With TACC3 rescue, the expression of vimentin,
HDAC2, and HDAC3 were elevated, while E-cadherin
expression was decreased (P<0.05; Figure 5E). These

of CCA cells and induced apoptosis as well as G2/M
cell cycle arrest. Mottamal et al. reported that Epoxide
1-Alaninechlamydocin isolated from Tolypocladium sp.
also elicited potent anti-proliferative effects, induction
of G2/M cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in human cancer
cells [39]. Our results are consistent with those of an
earlier report that claimed that TSA induced a delay in
G2/M transition of HeLa cells via the downregulation of
Cyclin B1, PIK1 and Survivin, and via the upregulation of
p21WAF1/CIP1 [40].
Furthermore, to identify the target transcripts
of HDACIs that may be potential regulators of the
suppression of CCA tumorigenesis, we determined mRNA
expression profiles by microarray analysis. The microarray
results revealed that the expression of TACC3 was downregulated in CCA cell lines upon treatment with TSA, a
finding confirmed by qRT-PCT and WB. Until recently, it
has been unclear whether TACC3 acts as an oncogene or a
tumor suppressor gene. Accumulating evidence indicates
that alterations in TACC3 expression depend on the
organ and type of cancer [30–35]. In this study, we found
that TACC3 was overexpressed in CCA tissues and was
positively correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM
stage, and differentiation. In addition, patients whose
tumors had high TACC3 expression exhibited a shortened
survival time, and this correlation was more obvious in
patients with stage I-II cancers compared with patients
with stage III-IV cancers. Our study demonstrated that
TACC3 may be a potential anti-cancer molecular drug
target of HDACIs and a potential prognostic indicator for
CCA.
Recently, various reports have suggested that
TACC3 may be a potential therapeutic target and that
the targeted knockdown of TACC3 can inhibit tumor cell
proliferation and induce apoptosis. TACC3 overexpression
is associated with defective checkpoint control and
impaired DNA repair systems, resulting in genomic
instability [41]. Additionally, TACC3 participates in
the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and
transcription [27]. HDACIs decrease ionic interactions
between DNA and histones, which results in chromatin
relaxation and the subsequent acceleration of DNA
transcription. However, the exact relationship of
HDACIs and TACC3 has not yet been elucidated. In
this study, we demonstrated that HDACIs downregulate
TACC3 expression and that targeted TACC3 knockdown
suppresses CCA cell proliferation and colony formation,
and induces G2/M phase arrest in vitro. These findings are
in agreement with previous studies that down-regulated
TACC3 inhibits cell growth in esophageal cancer [42]. In
addition, TACC3-depleted cells were highly sensitive to
paclitaxel-induced cell death, which occurred even when
the levels of active Akt and p21 were high [43]. Moreover,
Yim et al. also reported that TACC3 knockdown combined
with paclitaxel treatment led to a synergistic acceleration
of G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in HeLa cells [44].

To further investigate the potential therapeutic role
of TACC3 in CCA, a subcutaneous tumor model was
established in nude mice. Xenograft tumors grown from
blank and NC cells had larger mean volumes and weights
and were frequently more aggressive than tumors grown
from cells transfected with TACC3 shRNA (HuCCT-1,
P<0.001; TFK-1, P<0.001; Figure 6A). Next, a pulmonary
metastasis tumor model was generated by injection
of tumor cells into the tail vein of nude mice. Fewer
metastatic nodes were detected in the pulmonary tissues of
the treatment groups (TFK-1: TACC3 shRNA-1, P<0.05;
TACC3 shRNA-2, P<0.001; Figure 6B). qRT-PCR, WB
and IHC were performed to verify knockdown of TACC3.
Expression of TACC3 was decreased in subcutaneous
tumors formed by cells that were transfected with TACC3
shRNA (P<0.05; Figure 6C&6D). These results indicated
that targeted TACC3 knockdown suppresses tumor growth
and metastasis of CCA cells, in vivo.

DISCUSSION
CCA is the second most common hepatobiliary
malignancy [1] and is one of the most life-threatening
diseases due to its aggressiveness and metastatic
tendencies [36]. In spite of substantial progress, we
still lack a valid biomarker that is involved in tumor
proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in patients with
CCA. Therefore, it is urgent to find a new molecular
target for therapy and to predict the prognosis of patients
with CCA. Many studies have reported the differential
expression of specific HDAC isoforms in a variety of
hematological or solid malignancies and cell lines, such
as lymphoma [14], breast [15], gastric [16], colorectal
[17], and lung cancers [18], hepatocellular carcinoma
[19], and cholangiocarcinoma [20]. Class I and II HDACs
are overexpressed in a variety of CCA cell lines; however,
few studies have investigated HDAC expression status and
its prognostic value in CCA patients [20]. In this study,
we investigated the expression of HDACs 1-10 and their
biological significance in CCA. We found that HDACs 2,
3 and 8 were up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels
in CCA tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues.
In addition, the expression of HDACs 2 and 3 proteins, but
not HDAC8, was positively correlated with lymph node
metastasis, TNM stage, and differentiation. Moreover,
patients with high expression of HDAC2 or HDAC3 (or
both) had shorter OS. These results indicated that HDAC2
and 3 may serve as useful prognostic biomarkers and
that the modulation of the histone acetylation may be a
novel therapeutic strategy for CCA. HDACIs have the
potential to disrupt multiple signaling pathways to inhibit
tumor growth and induce apoptosis [37, 38]. Our data
showed that TSA and SAHA inhibited the proliferation

Taken together, these findings indicate that TACC3
may be a potential anti-cancer molecular target either in
combination with other drugs or alone.
EMT is a pivotal process in the early phase of
the metastasis cascade and can be initiated by various
signaling pathways [45]. Up-regulated expression of
TACC3 promotes EGF-mediated EMT via the initiation of
the PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling transduction pathways
[27, 29]. To investigate whether alterations in TACC3
gene expression impact the ability of CCA cells to
invade and migrate, wound-healing and Transwell assays
were performed. We found that knockdown of TACC3
reduced the invasive and migratory ability of CCA cells,
while increased TACC3 expression increased invasion
and migration. In addition, elevated expression of the
epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and reduced expression
of the mesenchymal marker, vimentin, after TACC3
knockdown verified the role of TACC3 in EMT. These
findings indicated that TACC3 might act as an important
regulator of CCA metastasis.
Based on our interesting in vitro findings, we next
established subcutaneous and pulmonary metastasis tumor
models to further investigate the potential therapeutic
role of TACC3 in CCA, in vivo. We found that targeted
silencing of TACC3 markedly inhibited xenograft tumor
growth and the formation of pulmonary metastatic nodes,
suggesting that down-regulation of TACC3 suppresses
EMT-induced invasion and metastasis. Another study
demonstrated that TACC3 suppression causes tumor
regression and leads to embryonic lethality in mice due to
massive apoptosis in tumor, but not normal, tissues [46].
Therefore, the targeted silencing of TACC3 may be a valid
approach for anti-tumor therapy for CCA; however, its
mechanism still needs further experimental exploration.
In summary, we observed that HDACs 2, 3, and 8
were over-expressed in CCA tissues and that HDACs 2
and 3 may serve as useful prognostic biomarkers for CCA.
The HDACIs, TSA and SAHA, inhibited the proliferation
of CCA cells and induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle
arrest. Microarray analysis demonstrated that TSA led to
the down-regulation of TACC3, and that patients with CCA
with a high TACC3 expression were predicted to have a
poor prognosis. Therefore, targeted TACC3 silencing may
be a valid approach for anti-tumor therapy for patients
with CCA.

resection between January 2008 and July 2010 at
the Department of Biliary and Pancreatic Surgery,
Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.
The clinicopathological information of the 79 patients
with CCA is listed in Supplementary Table S1. Group 2:
twenty-six fresh CCA samples and adjacent non-tumor
tissues were collected from the same hospital between
January 2014 and December 2014. None of the patients
had received any chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to
surgery. All diagnoses were confirmed by 2 pathologists
at Tongji Hospital. Tumor staging was based on the TNM
classification standard of the 7th edition of the UICC/AJCC
staging manual. All patients signed an informed consent
before surgery, and the ethics approval for this study
was obtained from the Tongji Hospital Research Ethics
Committee (Supplementary Figure S1).

Cell lines
Two human CCA cell lines, TFK-1 and HuCCT-1,
were kindly provided by Professor Peter Schemmer
(Department of General and Transplant Surgery,
University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany). The cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, CA, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, CA, USA), 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Beijing Solarbio
Science & Technology Co., Beijing, China) and were
maintained at 37°C in an incubator with 5% CO2.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) analysis
Total RNA was isolated from tissue specimens or
from cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using 2
μg of the total RNA according to the instructions of the
reverse transcriptase kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China)
in a LifePro Thermal Cycler (Hangzhou Bioer Technology
Co. Ltd., Hangzhou, China). Then, cDNA samples (2 μl)
were subjected to qRT-PCR using a SYBR® Premix EX
Taq kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China) for 40 cycles in
a CFX ConnectTM Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). ACTB was used as an internal control. Primers
were designed and synthesized by Shanghai Sango Biotech
Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China (listed in Supplementary Table
S2). The cycle threshold (Ct) of different genes was
first normalized to ACTB for the same sample, and fold
changes were calculated through relative quantification
(2-ΔΔCt).

(GAPDH) or β-actin. The primary antibodies used are
listed in Supplementary Table S3. To quantify the relative
levels of protein expression, the intensity of the specific
bands was estimated using the Image J2X analysis
software package (National Institute of Mental Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA).

A CCK-8 kit (Dojindo Laboratories Co. Ltd,
Kumamoto, Japan) was used as a colorimetric assay to
assess cell viability. Briefly, cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were
seeded into 96-well plates with 100 μl per well of RPMI1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
the indicated reagents. Each sample had six replicates. At
the indicated time points, the medium was replaced by 100
μl fresh culture medium, and 10 μl CCK-8 solution was
added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1-4 hours at
37°C before the absorbance was recorded at 450 nm using
a Quant ELISA Reader (BioTek Instruments, USA). The
percentage of viable cells was calculated according to the
following method in a previously published report [48]:
Survival Rate % =(ODtreated − ODblank)/(ODcontrol − ODblank)
× 100%. The IC50 was calculated using probit regression
analysis. The tests were repeated at least 3 times.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The streptavidin biotin compound (SABC) method
was used to detect the expression of HDAC2, 3, 8 and
TACC3 proteins, as previously described [47]. The
sections were incubated with a polyclonal or a monoclonal
antibody overnight at 4°C in a moist chamber at the
indicated dilutions (listed in Supplementary Table S3). The
next day, the sections were incubated with the appropriate
secondary antibody for 30 min at 37°C. Finally, the
sections were incubated with streptavidin-biotin complex
(Boster Biotech, Wuhan, China) at a dilution of 1:100 for 5
min and counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin, which
stains the nucleus. The slides were dehydrated, mounted,
and observed by microscopy. IHC scores were assessed by
3 pathologists who were blinded to the patient conditions,
as previously described [47].

Flow cytometry
Cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well
plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Then, the medium
was replaced by 2 ml fresh experimental medium
containing TSA or SAHA at different concentrations
according to the 48-hour IC50 values. After 48 hours, cells
were harvested, and the rate of apoptosis was determined
by an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit (KeyGen
Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Data analysis was performed
using FlowJo software. For cell cycle analysis, after 48
hours the cells were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at
20°C, stained with propidium iodide, and then analyzed
by a FACScan flow cytometer (Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) and ModFit 3.0 software (Verity Software House,
Topsham, ME, USA).

Microarray analysis
TFK-1 cells that were treated with 1% DMSO
and TSA (0.3 μmol/L) for 48 hours were selected
for microarray analysis; cells selection occurred in
triplicate. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines
using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, CA, USA),
the concentration of RNA in the samples was detected
by a NanoDrop ND-2000 (Thermo Scientific) and
RNA integrity was assessed by an Agilent Bioanalyzer
2100 (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, cDNA was
synthesized and labeled (Cyanine-3-CTP) before it
was purified and hybridized to the microarray (Agilent
SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression Array, 8*60K,
Design ID: 039494). After washing, the arrays were
scanned by an Agilent Scanner G2505C (Agilent
Technologies). Original data were extracted using
Feature Extraction software (version 10.7.1.1, Agilent
Technologies). Further data analysis was conducted
using Agilent Genespring software (version 12.5). To
identify significant differential expression of mRNAs,
we performed a Volcano Plot filtering (Fold Change
>=2.0 and P-value <=0.05) between the DMSO group
and the TSA-treated group. After that, the significantly
differentially expressed genes were further analyzed
by GO and KEGG software to judge their biological
function and the pathways through which they function.
Finally, hierarchical clustering was performed based on
the significant differential expression of mRNAs, and
a thermograph was used to demonstrate the expression
patterns of the differentially expressed genes between
both groups.

Transwell chambers (Corning NY, USA) were
pretreated with a mixture of RPMI-1640 and BD Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, NJ, USA) (90 μl; 8:1), which served
as the basement membrane. After the membrane was
hydrated in 0.1% BSA, cells (1 × 105 cells/chamber) were
seeded into the top chamber with 200 μl RPMI-1640
supplemented with 0.2% FBS. After 48 hours, cells were
fixed and stained. Cell counts were performed using the
Image-Pro Plus v6.0 software package (Media Cybernetics

counted in triplicate.

In vivo tumorigenicity and metastasis assays

Immunofluorescence (IF) assay

For the tumorigenicity assay, TFK-1 and HuCCT-1
cells (2 × 106 cells, suspended in 100 μl RPMI-1640
without FBS) were subcutaneously injected into the upper
right flank of nude mice (4-6 week-old, BALB/c/nu,
female). Tumor sizes were measured by a vernier caliper
every three days. Mice were sacrificed three weeks after
the injection of the cells. For the metastasis assay, TFK-1
cells were injected into the tail vein of nude mice. After
6 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and the metastatic nodes
in the lungs were examined by necropsy and counted.
All of the in vivo experiments were performed in specific
pathogen-free (SPF) conditions with the approval of
the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments
of Tongji Medical College. Details are provided in the
Supplementary Figure S2.

Cells grown on cover slips in 6-well plates were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room
temperature and then permeabilized by treatment with
0.4% Triton X-100 (Amresco, OH, USA) for 10 minutes.
After blocking with 1% BSA (Amresco, OH, USA) in
1X PBS (2 ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C, the cells were
incubated at 4°C overnight with the primary antibody
(TACC3, 1:50). Then, the cells were rinsed and incubated
for 1 hour at 37°C with fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated
Affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L; 1:20, ProteinTech
Group) as the secondary antibody. After the cells were
washed in PBS, the nuclei were stained by DAPI (5 μg/
