Phosphoinositide 3’-kinase delta: turning off BCR signaling in
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

was able to rescue mature B cells [6]. Expression of the
PI3Kδ isoform is largely restricted to hematopoietic cells,
where it is involved in B-cell homeostasis and function, as
demonstrated in mice with inactivating PI3K mutations.
Such mice have reduced numbers of B1 and marginal
zone B cells, reduced levels of immunoglobulins,
respond poorly to immunization, and display defective
BCR and CD40 signaling [7]. This restricted expression
makes PI3Kδ an ideal therapeutic target in hematologic
malignancies. CAL-101, the first p110δ inhibitor in
clinical use [8], is currently explored in advanced-stage
clinical trials in patients with B cell malignancies [9].
Recently, we characterized the effects of CAL-101 in
CLL in a series of correlative laboratory studies [10]. We
reported that CAL-101 thwarts CLL chemokine receptor
function and migration beneath marrow stroma cells.
Also, CAL-101 disrupted BCR signaling, life support
by nurselike cells, and BCR-dependent secretion of the
chemokine CCL3 (MIP-1α) by CLL cells in vitro and in
vivo in CLL patients receiving therapy with CAL-101.
These findings are important for understanding the
characteristic clinical activity of CAL-101 in CLL. After
start of therapy with CAL-101, CLL patients typically
experience rapid resolution of enlarged lymph nodes,
along with a transient surge in blood lymphocyte counts.
Then, oftentimes after weeks to months of therapy,
lymphocyte counts gradually improve and normalize
[9]. These effects are explained by CAL-101-induced
blockade of tissue anchors signals, the chemokine
receptors, which normally retain CLL cells in the lymph
glands (see Fig. 1). Later during therapy, the effects of
CAL-101 on survival signaling become apparent, leading
to the gradual decline in lymphocyte counts, and then
many patients achieve remissions. Interestingly, even
high-risk CLL patients, for example CLL patients with
17p deletions, which are largely resistant to conventional
CLL therapies [11], respond to inhibitors of BCRassociated kinases, such as CAL-101, and their response
rates do not seem to substantially differ from lower-risk
patients. What is also remarkable is that fact that Syk
and Btk inhibitors cause similar clinical effects in CLL
patients, early lymphocytosis and rapid lymph node
shrinkage, suggesting that these BCR-associated kinases
play similar roles for CLL cell migration, tissue homing,
and survival. Given the rapid, parallel development

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
pathway is involved in a wide variety of normal cellular
processes including cell death and survival, migration,
protein synthesis, and metabolism. PI3Ks are also
commonly activated in human cancers [1], either by
activating mutations of PI3K signaling modules, or by
pathway activation after triggering of surface receptors.
PIK3CA, the gene encoding the PI3K catalytic subunit
(p110α), PTEN inactivation, or mutations in the p85
regulatory subunit are examples of activating PI3K
mutations found in solid tumors. In contrast, leukemia
and lymphoma cells do not harbor activating PI3K
mutations [2], but nonetheless PI3Ks are constitutively
activated, presumably due to activating signals from the
microenvironment. In this context, PI3K signaling is
now targeted in first clinical trials in patients with B cell
malignancies, including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
(CLL), which represent one of the first molecularly
targeted therapies for B cell malignancies.
Interactions within neighbor stromal cells in tissue
microenvironments (bone marrow, secondary lymphatic
tissues) are necessary for maintenance and expansion of
normal and malignant B cell, mediated by activation of
various signaling pathways in the B cells, including B-cell
receptor (BCR) signaling [3]. The BCR pathway recently
emerged as a central pathway in the pathogenesis of several
B-cell malignancies [4], including chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) [5], and can be therapeutically targeted
with small molecule inhibitors of BCR-associated kinases,
inhibiting either Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Bruton’s
tyrosine kinase (Btk), or PI3K. PI3Ks play an essential,
non-redundant role in BCR signaling, as demonstrated in
a BCR deficient mouse model, in which PI3K signaling

of these new, targeted agents in the laboratory and in
clinical trials, these findings are already changing our
understanding of disease biology, and likely will have a
broad impact on treatments for patients with CLL, other
B cell malignancies [12, 13], and autoimmune disorders
[14] in the near-term future.
