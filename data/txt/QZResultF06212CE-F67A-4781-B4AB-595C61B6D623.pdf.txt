Inhibition of the Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter
Isoform-1 Reduces Glioma Invasion
Brian R. Haas and Harald Sontheimer

Abstract
Malignant gliomas metastasize throughout the brain by infiltrative cell migration into peritumoral areas.
Invading cells undergo profound changes in cell shape and volume as they navigate extracellular spaces along
blood vessels and white matter tracts. Volume changes are aided by the concerted release of osmotically active
ions, most notably K+ and Cl−. Their efflux through ion channels along with obligated water causes rapid cell
shrinkage. Suitable ionic gradients must be established and maintained through the activity of ion transport
systems. Here, we show that the Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter Isoform-1 (NKCC1) provides the
major pathway for Cl− accumulation in glioma cells. NKCC1 localizes to the leading edge of invading processes, and pharmacologic inhibition using the loop diuretic bumetanide inhibits in vitro Transwell migration by
25% to 50%. Short hairpin RNA knockdowns of NKCC1 yielded a similar inhibition and a loss of bumetanidesensitive cell volume regulation. A loss of NKCC1 function did not affect cell motility in two-dimensional
assays lacking spatial constraints but manifested only when cells had to undergo volume changes during migration. Intracranial implantation of human gliomas into severe combined immunodeficient mice showed a
marked reduction in cell invasion when NKCC1 function was disrupted genetically or by twice daily injection
of the Food and Drug Administration–approved NKCC1 inhibitor Bumex. These data support the consideration
of Bumex as adjuvant therapy for patients with high-grade gliomas. Cancer Res; 70(13); 5597–606. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Among the most difficult cancers to treat, gliomas are primary brain tumors derived from glial cells. Their unusual
propensity to diffusely invade surrounding brain makes complete surgical resection impossible (1). Unlike other cancers,
which spread hematogenously, gliomas actively migrate
along blood vessels or white matter tracts (2). The narrow
extracellular spaces require invading glioma cells to undergo
dynamic changes in cell shape and volume, which has been
suggested to be accomplished partially by ion channel activity (3, 4). It has been postulated that invading tumor cells
may shrink their leading processes while moving into narrow
spaces by coordinating the release of K+ and Cl− along with
osmotically obligated water. These ions may be released
through ion channels or transporters; research on glioma
cells suggests that invading glioma cells primarily use ion
channels for this process (5–8). Therefore, cells must establish and maintain suitable ionic gradients for K+ and Cl−. Due

to Na+/K+-ATPase activity, cytoplasmic [K+] is high, creating
an outward gradient for K+ in most living cells. However, this
is not true for Cl− ions. Indeed, most neurons do not maintain a significant gradient for Cl− ions, which instead are
thought to be distributed at equilibrium. Recent studies evaluating immature neurons, astrocytes, and gliomas concluded
that Cl − ions accumulate intracellularly, establishing an
outwardly directed gradient for Cl−. Direct measurements using Cl−–specific indicators suggest that Cl− concentrations
may be as high as 100 mmol/L in immature neurons (9),
40 mmol/L in astrocytes (10), but only around 6 to 10
mmol/L in mature neurons (11). In immature neurons, this
explains why the activation of γ-aminobutyric acid–gated Cl−
channels causes depolarization of the cell membrane. We recently showed that Cl− is maintained ∼100 mmol/L in glioma
cells (12) and that the electrochemical gradient for Cl− provides the energetic driving force for cell shrinkage as cells
invade (12). The high intracellular [Cl−] in gliomas is probably achieved through the action of the Sodium-PotassiumChloride Cotransporter Isform 1 (NKCC1; ref. 13). NKCC1 is
ubiquitously expressed in most tissue types, aiding in cell volume regulation (14). It couples the influx of Na+, K+, and 2Cl−,
using the inward gradient for Na+ for the uphill transport of
two Cl−. NKCC1 is sensitive to bumetanide, a loop diuretic,
used under the trade name Bumex, for the treatment of
patients with severe renal failure (15–17).
In this study, we investigate the contribution of NKCC1 to
glioma cell migration and invasion hypothesizing that
NKCC1 activity establishes a gradient for Cl− necessary to
support cell volume changes required of invading glioma

cells. Under conditions mimicking the spatial constraints
encountered in vivo, we show that NKCC1 localizes to the
leading edges of migrating cells and pharmacologic inhibition of NKCC1 with the loop diuretic, bumetanide, reduces
glioma cell migration. Furthermore, we show that the genetic
knockdown of NKCC1, using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs, inhibits cellular volume regulation and eliminates
bumetanide-sensitive migration. Implantation of human glioma cells into immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice shows significantly reduced
cellular invasion in animals chronically treated with bumetanide or implanted with NKCC1 knockdown cells. These data
suggest the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved
loop diuretic bumetanide or related compounds could be
considered for clinical use in patients with invasive malignant gliomas.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Experiments were performed using glioma cell lines D54MG (glioblastoma multiforme, WHO grade IV; Dr. D. Bigner,
Duke University, Durham, NC) and U87-MG [glioblastoma
multiforme, WHO grade IV, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), passaged < 4 mo]. The D54 line has not recently
been authenticated. Cell cultures were maintained in
DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 2 mmol/L Lglutamine (CellGro) and 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Aleken
Biologicals). Glioma cells were kept at 37°C in a 90% O2/10%
CO2 humidified atmosphere. HEK293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95% O2/5% CO2
humidified atmosphere.
Solutions
NaCl bath solution (pH 7.4, osmolarity 310 ± 10 mOsm)
contained the following (in mmol/L): 130 NaCl, 5.0 KCl,
10.5 glucose, 32.5 HEPES, and 1 CaCl 2. Bumetanide was
added to bath solutions or migration assay buffer from a
1,000 × stock solution. DMSO at its final concentration
(0.1%) did not disturb cell volumes or affect volume regulation (data not shown).
Cell volume measurements and proliferation
Cell volumes were measured as previously described (18),
by electronic sizing with a Coulter counter Multisizer 3
(Beckman-Coulter). Cells were kept at 37°C in bath solution
during volume regulation experiments. Relative volume
measurements were calculated as a ratio to the average of
five baseline measurements before hyperosmotic challenge.
Proliferation assays were performed as previously described
(19) in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of
bumetanide (Sigma) and were measured in triplicate.
Immunocytochemistry
D54-MG (D54) and U87-MG (U87) glioma cells were
grown and fixed as previously described (19); NKCC1 antibody (Millipore) was diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS plus 3.3% normal goat

serum in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing
with PBS, FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were diluted 1:500 in blocking
buffer and incubated for 1 hour in the dark. Cells were
washed twice with PBS, incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) 1:2,000 in PBS, and washed once with
PBS. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Gel
Mount aqueous mounting medium (Sigma). Fluorescent
images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M using a
×63 oil immersion lens.
Transwell migration assays
As prior studies (12), 8.0- or 3.0-μm pore polyethylene teraphthalate track-etched membrane cell culture inserts (BD
Biosciences) were prepared, and cells were allowed 5 or 12
hours (8.0- and 3.0-μm pore sizes, respectively) to migrate in
the presence or absence of bumetanide. Five random fields
per insert were imaged at ×20 magnification on a Zeiss
Axiovert 200M. Migrated cells were counted using ImageJ
(NIH Image, NIH). To visualize NKCC1 localization, migrating D54 cells were fixed, stained, and imaged as previously
described (20) with a ×40 air objective. Digital zooms of a
single cell were taken at 0.5-μm steps for a total of 61 images
(30.5 μm) and 76 images (38 μm) for the leading and lagging
edges, respectively.
Two-dimensional scratch/migration assay
D54 or U87 glioma cells were grown to a confluent monolayer, and scratches were made using a 200-μL pipette tip.
Cells recovered and migrated into the wound site for 8 hours
in the presence or absence of bumetanide. Images were acquired with at ×10 magnification with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M
at 0 and 8 hours. The scratch area was measured using
ImageJ at both 0 and 8 hours, and quantified as a ratio of
8:0 hours.
Western blot protocol
Cultured cells were lysed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper as previously
described (21). Membranes were blocked in a blocking buffer
(5% milk in TBS plus Tween 20) for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, the membranes were incubated in primary
NKCC antibody, which recognizes both isoforms (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 1:5,000 in blocking buffer
for 30 minutes at room temperature. The membranes were
washed three times for 15 minutes in 5% milk in TBS plus
Tween 20 and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 minutes
at room temperature. After washing, blots were developed
with Super Signal West Fempto enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an Eastman Kodak
Image Station 4000 MM (Kodak). NKCC immunoreactivity
was normalized to actin loading control (Sigma).
ShRNA and control stable cell lines
To knockdown NKCC1 expression, we obtained commercially available pGIPZ-lentiviral shRNAmir vectors containing

D54 cells were transfected using the Amaxa Biosystems
nucleofection technique, as previously detailed (22).
In vivo animal studies
All animal experiments were approved and in accordance
with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Tumor cells
(5 × 105) were stereotactically injected at a 2.5-mm depth,
2.0 to 2.5 mm left of midline, and 2.0 to 2.5 mm posterior to
bregma into female C.B.-17 SCID mice, ages 6 to 8 weeks, as
previously reported (23). A total of 5 × 105 tumor cells were
implanted in two 5-μL injections. Mice were divided into
two treatment groups involving twice daily injections of bumetanide (5.5mg/kg) or vehicle for 3 weeks. For knockdown
cells, they were prepared as above but without randomized
treatment groups. Afterwards, the brains were removed and

placed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. The PFA was replaced
with a 10% sucrose solution in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4; phosphate buffer contains 28.34 mmol/L NaH2PO4
and 72.11 mmol/L Na2HPO4) for 1 hour at 4°C. Brains were
transferred to a 30% sucrose solution (in phosphate buffer)
at 4°C until the brains sank (∼30 h). Brains were embedded
in O.C.T. Compound Tissue Tek (Sakura Finetek), sliced on
a Leica CM 1850 UV cryostat (Leica Microsystems) into
30-μm serial sections, and placed on Colorfrost/Plus slides
(Fisher-Thermo Scientific). Slices were treated to remove
O.C.T. compound and stained with H&E. Images for analysis
were acquired with Olympus BX51 upright modified with
a LUDL motorized stage using the ×4 objective. Every
tenth section was analyzed using the Stereo Investigator
software's Cavalieri estimator to calculate tumor volume
(MBF Bioscience). Fluorescent images of every tenth section
were acquired with the AxioVision 4.6 software (Carl Zeiss)
on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M. The software is equipped with a
Length tool function allowing the accurate measurement of
distances in an image. The Length function was used to
measure tumor invasion distance from the edge of the
tumor mass.
Statistical analysis
For all experiments, raw data were analyzed and
graphed using the Origin 7.5 software (Microcal Software),
and appropriate statistical tests were chosen according to
the data analyzed using GraphPad Instat (GraphPad Software). Unless otherwise stated, all data are reported with
SEM and *, **, or *** indicate P < 0.05, P < 0.01, or P <
0.001, respectively.

NKCC1 Inhibition Reduces Glioma Invasion

volume changes that aid the invasion of glioma cells; hence,
this transporter plays an essential role in glioma invasion.
To examine this question, we used several cell migration/
invasion assays in which the efficacy of pharmacologic or genetic inhibitors of NKCC1 was investigated. We used two
common human glioma cell lines, D54 and U87. As illustrated in Fig. 1, both cell lines showed robust NKCC1 expression
as judged by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A) and Western
blot analysis (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for full-length blots;
Fig. 1B). To mimic the spatial constraints of extracellular
brain space, we used 8- or 3-μm pore Transwell migration assays. U87 and D54 glioma cells were allowed to migrate for 5
or 12 hours (8- or 3-μm pore Transwell, respectively) in the
presence or absence of bumetanide. As exhibited in Fig. 2A,
bumetanide significantly inhibited D54 glioma cell migration
compared with controls through 8- and 3-μm pore Transwell
barriers by approximately 25% and 50%, respectively (Fig. 2B1).
A similar inhibition was found for U87 glioma cells with ∼35%
inhibition of migration across the 8-μm pore Transwell barrier
and 50% inhibition across the 3-μm pore (Fig. 2B2).
Because NKCC1 is important for glioma cells' volume
adjustment in constricted spaces, we would expect migration
in an unrestricted environment to be less dependent on
NKCC1. To test this, we assessed glioma migration in a
two-dimensional wound closure assay with D54 and U87 glioma cells. Figure 2C shows example images of U87 glioma
cells taken at 0 and 8 hours, in the presence or absence of
bumetanide. After 8 hours, average wound closure was
∼50% in U87 cells and 35% in D54, and importantly,
bumetanide did not alter the wound closure significantly
(Fig. 2D1), suggesting that cell motility was unaffected. To
rule out any antiproliferative effects of bumetanide, D54 cells
were grown for 4 days in varying concentrations of bumetanide, 0.2 to 200 μmol/L, which did not alter population

growth throughout the experiment duration (Fig. 2D2). At
day 4, there was no significant difference in the normalized
cell number across all conditions. These data suggest that
NKCC1 inhibition compromises cell invasion across barriers
without affecting overall cell motility.
NKCC1 localizes to the leading edge of invading
glioma cells
For NKCC1 to participate in cell invasion as an influx pathway for Cl−, it may be advantageous to localize the transporter to cell processes already past spatial constraints and in the
process of enlarging their volume. We therefore examined the
cellular localization of NKCC1 glioma cells fixed in the midst
of traversing a Transwell barrier. As depicted in Fig. 3, the
leading edges/processes of migrating D54 glioma cells
showed colocalization of NKCC1 and phalloidin, whereas
the lagging parts showed little to no colocalization. Separate
digital magnifications of the boxed area (Fig. 3) highlight the
lagging and leading edges. Arrows indicate points at which
the cell is depicted in “three-view” (central panel is x,y; top
panel is x,z; left panel is z,y). These data suggest that glioma
cells migrating across a Transwell barrier preferentially localize NKCC1 to the membrane on leading edges of the cell.
Genetic knockdown of NKCC1 eliminates
bumetanide-sensitive migration
Although bumetanide is a fairly selective NKCC inhibitor,
it has been reported to block some other transporters, most
notably, the Potassium-Chloride Cotransporters (KCC;
refs. 24–27). Hence, to show that the above effects were
due to NKCC1 disruption and not KCC, we suppressed
NKCC1 by stably transfecting D54 glioma cells with lentiviral
vectors expressing five different NKCC1-knockdown shRNAs
(27, 141, 382, 662, and 690), each targeting a different region

of the SLC12A2 gene, or a scrambled, nonsilencing (NS)
shRNA. To determine whether NKCC1 levels were effectively
knocked down, protein levels from whole-cell lysates from
knockdown-transfected cells were compared with NS by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). The NKCC antibody recognizes both isoforms, but only NKCC1 has been found in gliomas (13). HEK293 cells were used as a positive control as
they express both NKCC1 and NKCC2. As shown in Fig. 4A,
expression of NKCC was significantly reduced with four of
the five NKCC1-knockdown shRNA constructs. After normalizing to actin, constructs 27, 382, 662, and 690 each reduced
NKCC expression by at least 50% compared with NS (Fig. 4B).
The shRNA construct 141, which failed to decrease NKCC
expression, was not further used.
We next examined NKCC1-knockdown lines in biological
assays examining growth, Transwell migration, and bumetanide sensitivity. There was no significant difference in cell
proliferation between NS and all knockdowns (Fig. 4C). We
then determined the ability of cells to migrate in the presence or absence of bumetanide. Employing 3-μm pore Transwell barriers, we studied the migration of two knockdown

lines, 662 and 690, compared with NS cells. NS cell migration
was inhibited by 50% in the presence of bumetanide over
12 hours (Fig. 4D), yet the two knockdown cell lines were bumetanide insensitive (unpaired t test, P > 0.05). The abolishment of bumetanide-sensitive migration in knockdowns 662
and 690 along with the Western blot analysis is consistent
with a loss of functional NKCC1.
NKCC1 blockade with bumetanide or through genetic
knockdown blocks functional volume regulation
We hypothesize that during Transwell migration, cells
must regulate their volume to traverse the pores involving
the release of Cl−, K+, and H2O. Once successfully traversed, cells utilize NKCC1 to reestablish volume. To mimic these volume changes, we used an osmotic challenge
(15 mmol/L NaCl) while monitoring cell volume changes
with a Multisizer-3 Coulter Counter. The ability of glioma
cells to regulate their volume back to baseline after hyperosmotic challenge is termed regulatory volume increase
(RVI) and was presented in the presence or absence
of 200 μmol/L bumetanide at 37°C. Figure 5A shows that

NKCC1 Inhibition Reduces Glioma Invasion

vehicle-treated D54 glioma cells undergo bumetanide-sensitive RVI, and 40 minutes postchallenge, D54 glioma cells
exposed to bumetanide had failed to regulate their volume
back to baseline compared with cells exposed to vehicle
(Fig. 5A, right). Similarly, RVI in NS cells was completely
inhibited by bumetanide, whereas both 662 and 690 knockdown cells failed to undergo RVI in the presence or absence of bumetanide (Fig. 5B). In Fig. 5B (bottom right),
the normalized mean cell volumes (MCV), compared
across all conditions at 40 minutes postchallenge, were significantly different from NS cells exposed to vehicle but
not from each other. Together, these data confirm that genetic knockdown confers functional inhibition of NKCC1.
Inhibition of NKCC1 by bumetanide or stable
knockdown decreases glioma cell invasion from
tumors implanted into SCID mice
After assessing the effects on NKCC1 inhibition on glioma
cells in vitro, we next investigated whether the inhibition of
NKCC1 would affect glioma cell migration and invasion

in vivo by implanting D54 glioma cells stably transfected with
eGFP (D54-eGFP), and either NS or 662, into the brains of
SCID mice. Tumors were confirmed and visualized in vivo
using an 8.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and representative images (Supplementary Fig. S2) suggest markedly
reduced tumor sizes after bumetanide treatment. However,
the limited spatial resolution of MRI combined with the tumor metastasis made it impossible to quantitatively assess
tumor volumes by serial MRI. Therefore, we complemented
these studies by assessing tumor volume with quantitative
stereology. Slices were stained with H&E, and tumor volumes
were determined using the Cavalieri estimator of the Stereo
Investigator software (Fig. 6A). Tumor volumes were highly
variable in vehicle-treated tumors, but smaller and less variable in bumetanide-treated mice. Due to the variability of the
vehicle-treated group, this difference did not quite reach statistical significance (P = 0.06; Fig. 6C1). Because our Transwell studies imply NKCC1 functions primarily to aid cell
invasion, we determined the glioma cell invasiveness into
peritumoral brain by measuring distances migrated from

the primary tumor mass. Using green fluorescent protein
fluorescence, we acquired images of all visible invading cells
(Fig. 6B). After measuring each invading cell(s) distance, we
calculated the average distance migrated from the tumor
mass (Fig. 6D1). We found a significant difference between
vehicle- and bumetanide-treated tumors. We then plotted
the distance of cell migration as a function of frequency of
occurrence (Fig. 6D3). These data were well fit to a single
exponential function. An exponential decrease in the cell
number with invasion distance is predicted by Withers and
Lee (28). From this function, y = A1*e(−x/t)+y0, one can conveniently derive the decay constants (t) of 295.4 ± 78.7 and
160.0 ± 12.5 for vehicle- and bumetanide-treated tumors, re-

spectively (Supplementary Table S1 for equation values),
with the Origin 7.5 software for comparison. These data suggest that roughly one third (1/e) of the vehicle-treated tumor
cells migrated at least 295 μm from the tumor, which was
almost twice that of bumetanide-treated tumors. Hence,
these data indicate that bumetanide inhibits in vivo glioma
cell invasion.
We then repeated these in vivo experiments using one
NKCC1-knockdown cell line, 662, compared with NS cells.
As before, we assessed tumor volume and found no statistical
difference between NS and 662 tumor volumes (Fig. 6C2).
However, when we evaluated the average distance glioma
cells migrated from the tumor mass, we found a significant

NKCC1 Inhibition Reduces Glioma Invasion

decrease in invading 662 cells (Fig. 6D2). The average
distance migrated from the tumor mass was significantly
different at 170.74 and 123.55 μm for NS and 662 tumors, respectively. As previously mentioned, we further examined the
frequency distribution of glioma cell migration (Fig. 6D4) deriving the decay constants of 154.0 ± 5.3 for NS tumors and
111.9 ± 6.3 for 662 tumors. These data, from in vivo tumor
growth, suggest NKCC1 facilitates the invasion of glioma cells.

Discussion
In this study, we show that the disruption of Cl− uptake
through NKCC1, pharmacologically, or shRNA-knockdown
inhibits glioma cell invasion. More specifically, cell migration
was inhibited in three-dimensional migration assays in which
cells encounter spatial constraints, yet cell motility on a twodimensional substrate was unaffected by NKCC1 inhibition.
Importantly, NKCC1 inhibition reduced cell invasion upon
implantation of gliomas into SCID mice in which individual
tumor cells invaded significantly less deep into the surrounding brain upon NKCC1 disruption.
These findings support the hypothesis that glioma cells
undergo profound changes in cell volume as they invade
brain tissue and they use Cl− as an osmolyte to regulate cell
volume while invading. Ion movement across the membrane
is associated with obligatory water movement and has been
shown to play a critical role in cell shape and volume
changes associated with glioma cell migration (3, 12, 29,
30), and if normosmotic conditions are perturbed, glioma
cell migration is significantly reduced (see Supplementary
Fig. S3 and Supplementary Text). Ion movement also plays
an important role in migration in other cell types. Chloride
efflux through ion channels has been shown to play a major
role in cell invasion. For example, in HeLa cells, pharmalogical inhibition of Cl− channels or antisense knockdown of
the chloride channel ClC-3 inhibits Transwell migration by
50% (31). Similar results were reported for nasopharyngeal
carcinoma cells (32). Glioma cells express several members
of the ClC channel family including ClC-3 (33), and the Cl−
channel inhibitor 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate
reduces invasion (29). Consequently, ClC-3 may similarly
be involved in the volume changes of invading glioma cells.
However, for purposes of this study, the molecular identity
of the underlying Cl− current is irrelevant. For Cl− to act as
osmolyte, it must be accumulated intracellularly and requires sustained uptake of Cl− through NKCC1. Indeed, gliomas have been shown to accumulate Cl− up to 100 mmol/L
intracellularly (12).

Several studies (34, 35), including ones in glioma cells
(22, 36), suggest that Cl− efflux is important during defined
stages of cell division, particularly preceding mitosis. We were
surprised to find cell proliferation unaffected by NKCC1 disruption. It is possible that chronic NKCC1 inhibition leads to
compensatory expression of alternative Cl− transporters, for
example, the Cl−/HCO3− transporter AE3 (37). This may also
explain why NKCC1-null mice are viable at birth (38). Despite
possible compensatory mechanisms, our study shows that
NKCC1 inhibition with bumetanide decreases cell migration.
Although, bumetanide is a potent inhibitor of NKCC1, it could
possibly affect other cation/chloride cotransporters, such as
the KCCs, even with the affinity NKCC>>KCC (27). Although
the bumetanide concentration used (200 μmol/L) may have
also inhibited KCCs, similar or even higher concentrations
have previously been used by us (12, 13) and others (39–43)
to selectively block NKCC1. Importantly, our data (Fig. 5)
shows that NKCC1-knockdown cells are insensitive to bumetanide, suggesting that the drug targets only NKCC1 in our
experiments.
We also found that invading glioma cells preferentially localize NKCC1 at the leading edge. This may suggest that Cl−
transport supports local cell volume changes, which possibly
does not affect overall cell volume. An important aspect of
the pharmalogical affect of bumetanide on cell invasion is
the fact that the drug is FDA approved (Bumex) for the treatment of kidney disease, and hence, it would have a short path
to clinical use as adjuvant therapy for gliomas.
