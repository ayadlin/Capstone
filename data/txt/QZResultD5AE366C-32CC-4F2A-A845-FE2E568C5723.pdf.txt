ABSTRACT
This study aimed to identify gastric mucosal protectants that suppress intestinal
tumorigenesis in a mouse model. We chose six gastric mucosal protectants (ecabet
sodium hydrate, irsogladine maleate, rebamipide, sofalcone, teprenone and troxipide)
and examined their effects on the activity of oxidative stress-related transcriptional
factors, including AP-1, NF-κB, NRF2, p53 and STAT3, in Caco-2 cells using a luciferase
reporter gene assay. Among the six protectants, irsogladine maleate clearly inhibited
NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the chemopreventive property
of irsogladine maleate was examined in a Min mouse model of familial adenomatous
polyposis. Treatment with irsogladine maleate at doses of 5 and 50 ppm significantly
reduced the number of intestinal polyps to 69% and 66% of the untreated control
value, respectively. In these polyps, mRNA levels of the downstream targets of
NF-κB, such as IL-1β and IL-6, were decreased by irsogladine maleate treatment.
Moreover, the levels of oxidative stress-related markers, reactive carbonyl species,
in the livers of Min mice were clearly decreased following the administration of
irsogladine maleate. This study demonstrated that irsogladine maleate suppresses
intestinal polyp formation in Min mice partly through the NF-κB signaling pathway,
thus reducing oxidative stress.

colorectal tumors had all been excised by endoscopy. We
successfully demonstrated for the first time that low-dose,
enteric-coated aspirin therapy suppresses colorectal tumor
recurrence in Asian patients (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.36–
0.98), and the suppressive effects were more significant in
non-smokers than smokers. These results are in line with
observations obtained in other colorectal tumor recurrence
trials in Western countries using aspirin [6].
However, in addition to its valuable effects, aspirin
has adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and
hemorrhagic stroke [7]. As aspirin is a nonselective and
irreversible cyclooxygenase (COX)-inhibitor, aspirin

INTRODUCTION
It is important to establish effective preventive
methods against colorectal cancer (CRC) as it currently
accounts for approximately 8% of all cancer deaths
worldwide [1] and is the fourth leading cause of cancer
deaths. One potentially effective prevention strategy is
use of aspirin, a classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID) [2–4]. Recently, we investigated the effects
of low-dose, enteric-coated aspirin tablets in a doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial [5].
The participants were patients whose single/multiple

To overcome these adverse effects, several approaches can
be considered: (i) a reduction of the doses and treatment
periods, (ii) the co-prescription of a gastric mucosal
protectant, (iii) the eradication of Helicobacter pylori
infection, which is a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding
and (iv) the establishment of age restriction for aspirin
use, which may overcome bleeding complications. We
hypothesized that combining aspirin administration with
a gastric mucosal protectant would reduce the risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding. In this study, we only aimed
to identify gastric mucosal protectants that suppress
intestinal tumorigenesis in a mouse model, and left for
future experiments whether the combined treatment of
aspirin and gastric mucosal protectants inhibits intestinal
carcinogenesis while suppressing the side-effects of
aspirin.
Well-known oxidative stress-related transcription
factors, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factorκB (NF-κB), NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), p53 and
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
[8], have been implicated in carcinogenesis. Among these,
NRF2 and p53 possess anti-carcinogenic potential when
activated.
Through their anti-oxidative stress potential,
gastric mucosal protectants may play a suppressive role
on intestinal tumorigenesis. However, this potential has
not been clarified, and screening methods that completely
evaluate the activities of oxidative stress-related
transcriptional factors have not been performed. Thus,
we aimed to identify an ideal gastric mucosal protectant
with anti-oxidative stress and anti-intestinal tumorigenesis
potential. We chose six gastric mucosal protectants
that have been clinically used: ecabet sodium hydrate,
irsogladine maleate, rebamipide, sofalcone, teprenone
and troxipide. These test reagents are not H2 blockers
or proton pump inhibitors because strong inhibition of
gastric acid is reported to induce hypergastrinemia, which
enhances the growth of tumors in Apc-mutant Min mice
[9]. In this study, we demonstrated that irsogladine maleate
significantly suppressed NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional
activities and decreased intestinal tumorigenesis in Min
mice. Based on the reduced levels of reactive carbonyl
species (RCs) in Min mice treated with irsogladine
maleate, the mechanisms underlying the suppressive effect
of the drug on intestinal tumorigenesis are also discussed.

μM each for 24 hours (Figure 1 and 2). Irsogladine maleate
decreased AP-1 and NF-κB transcriptional activities by
47% and 38% of the untreated control value, respectively
(Figure 2A). Rebamipide decreased NRF2 transcriptional
activities by 16% of the untreated control value, although
it decreased AP-1 by 30% (Figure 2B). Ecabet sodium
hydrate decreased NF-κB and p53 transcriptional
activities by 29% and 36% of the untreated control
value, respectively, but increased STAT3 transcriptional
activity by 61% (Figure 2D). Teprenone increased NFκB, increased NRF2 and decreased STAT3 transcriptional
activities (Figure 2F). Troxipide and sofalcone had
disturbance effects on the negative control, and their data
were not included in the analysis (Figure 2C and 2E).
Among the test reagents, the data from irsogladine maleate
were best aligned with the purpose of this study. As AP-1
and NF-κB play important roles in the early stage of
intestinal tumorigenesis, we selected irsogladine maleate
for further in vivo experiments.

The suppression of NF-κB transcriptional
activity by irsogladine maleate and
NF-κB inhibitor
NF-κB transcriptional activity was examined
following treatment with irsogladine maleate (100 and
200 μM) and an NF-κB inhibitor (10 μM SM-7368) in
Caco-2 and HCT-15 cells (Figure S1). In Caco-2 cells,
irsogladine maleate at doses of 100 and 200 μM for
24 hours treatment decreased NF-κB transcriptional
activity by 16% and 31% of the untreated control value,
respectively (Figure S1A). Similarly, in HCT-15 cells,
irsogladine maleate at doses of 100 and 200 μM for
24 hours treatment decreased NF-κB transcriptional
activity by 22% and 29% of the untreated control value,
respectively (Figure S1D). SM-7368 at a dose of 10 μM
for 24 hours treatment decreased NF-κB transcriptional
activity by 70.5% of the untreated control value in Caco-2
cells and by 64.4% in HCT-15 cells.
Moreover, cytokine mixture (TNFα, IL-1β and
EGF)-stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity was
examined following treatment with irsogladine maleate
(100 and 200 μM) SM-7368 in Caco-2 cells for 24 and
48 hours (Figure S1B and C). A 24-h irsogladine maleate
treatment at doses of 100 and 200 μM decreased cytokine
mixture-stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity by 8.3%
and 11.3% of the untreated control value, respectively. A
48-h irsogladine maleate treatment at doses of 100 and
200 μM decreased NF-κB transcriptional activity by
18.9% (**p < 0.01 vs control) and 30.8% (***p < 0.001
vs control) of the untreated control value, respectively.
Similarly, a 48-h irsogladine maleate treatment at doses of
100 and 200 μM decreased cytokine mixture-stimulated
NF-κB transcriptional activity by 6.8% and 22.0%
(***p < 0.001 vs control) of the untreated control value,
respectively.

The suppression of intestinal polyp formation in
Min mice by irsogladine maleate

Table 1 summarizes the data for the number and
distribution of intestinal polyps in the basal diet and
irsogladine maleate-treated groups. Almost all polyps
developed in the small intestine, with only a few developing
in the colon. The representative photos of small intestinal
polyps in the three groups are shown in Figure S4. The total
number of polyps decreased with the administration of 5
and 50 ppm irsogladine maleate to 69.3% and 66.1% of the
untreated control value, respectively. Polyp formation was
reduced in the proximal segment by 61.5% (p < 0.01 vs basal
diet) and in the distal segment by 21.9% (p < 0.05 vs basal
diet) with the administration of 5 ppm irsogladine maleate;
with the administration of 50 ppm irsogladine maleate, polyp
formation in the proximal segment was reduced by 53.8%
(p < 0.01 vs basal diet) and that in the middle segment was
reduced by 39.7% (p < 0.01 vs basal diet). In the colon, no
remarkable change was observed following treatment with
irsogladine maleate.

The administration of 5 and 50 ppm irsogladine
maleate to Min mice for 8 weeks did not affect body
weight, food intake or clinical signs throughout the
experimental period. Average daily food intake did not
differ significantly among the groups. In addition, there
were no observed changes in organ weights that might
have been attributable to toxicity. Of note, no clear
histopathological changes were observed by irsogladine
maleate treatment to the stomach (Figure S2). However,
serum triglyceride levels were changed, and decreased
with the administration of 5 and 50 ppm irsogladine
maleate to 42.1% (p < 0.01 vs 0 ppm) and 73.4% of the
untreated control value, respectively. In the serum free
fatty acid and total cholesterol levels, no remarkable
change was observed (Figure S3)

Figure S5 shows the size distributions of the
intestinal polyps in the basal diet and irsogladine maleatetreated groups. The maximal number of polyps was
observed in the size range up to 3.0 mm in diameter. The
administration of 5 ppm irsogladine maleate significantly
reduced the numbers of polyps sized < 0.5 mm (p < 0.01
vs basal diet) and between 1.5 and 2.0 mm (p < 0.05 vs
basal diet) in diameter. Fifty ppm irsogladine maleate also

decreased the number of polyps sized < 0.5 mm (p < 0.01
vs basal diet) and those between 0.5 and 1.0 mm (p < 0.05
vs basal diet) in diameter.
To evaluate the suppressive effects of irsogladine
maleate on intestinal polyp development in Min mice,
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was measured in
the cell nuclei by immunohistochemistry. The percentage
of PCNA-positive cells in each polyp was slightly, but not

0.05) (Figure 4). Through a comparison with authentic
RCs, certain peaks were attributed to 32 RCs, including
acrolein, pentanal, hexanal, 2,4-NDE, 2-nonenal, HNE,
tetradecanal, hexadecanal and heptadecanal (Figure 5,
Table 2 ). Table 2 presents the detected levels of these
identified RCs in the liver samples of the irsogladine
maleate-treated or non-treated mice. It is noteworthy that
the levels of 17 identified RCs including typical DNA and/
or protein damaging RCs were significantly lower in the
liver samples taken from irsogladine maleate-treated mice
than those of the non-treated mice.

Suppression of the down-stream target genes of
NF-κB in the intestinal polyps of Min mice by
irsogladine maleate
The down-stream target genes of NF-κB in the
intestinal polyp and non-polyp portions of Min mice
were investigated. Real-time PCR revealed that treatment
with 5 ppm irsogladine maleate for 8 weeks significantly
suppressed interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels
in the intestinal polyp segments by 85% and 51% of
the untreated values, respectively (Figure 3). Inhibitor
of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKBKB)
mRNA levels tended to be reduced in intestinal polyp
segments by 48% of the untreated value. The effects of 50
ppm irsogladine maleate on IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels
were not significant (Figure S6).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, irsogladine maleate was
selected from a group of six gastric mucosal protectants
following through screening methods to evaluate their
suppressive activities on multiple oxidative stress-related
transcription factors. Furthermore, Min mice treated with
irsogladine maleate had a significantly reduced number of
intestinal polyps.
Regarding reports of the tumor suppressive effects of
irsogladine maleate, the suppressive effect of irsogladine
maleate on N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidineinitiated and glyoxal-promoted gastric carcinogenesis has
been demonstrated in male Wistar rats [10]. Twenty-five
or 100 ppm irsogladine maleate in the diet for 25 weeks
reduced the average numbers of digestive tract neoplasms
up to 61% of the untreated group value. In addition,
another report described the suppressive effects of
irsogladine maleate on diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated
and phenobarbital-promoted hepatocarcinogenesis in
male F344 rats [11]. Irsogladine maleate in the diet at
125 ppm for 35 weeks did not allow the development of
liver neoplasms (incidence, 0/14 rats). As far as we know,
this is the first report to examine the effects of irsogladine
maleate on intestinal neoplastic lesions. Comparing
the doses and treatment periods of our study with other
reports, irsogladine maleate suppressed the development of

Reduction of the levels of oxidative stress-related
markers and reactive carbonyl species in Min
mice treated with irsogladine maleate
Irsogladine maleate protects against intestinal
polyp development in Min mice, potentially through
the suppression of NF-κB-related oxidative stress. To
examine this mechanism, we used liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and detected the reactive
carbonyl species in the liver of Min mice with or without
irsogladine maleate treatment. LC/MS detected a total
of 240, 236 and 238 peaks in the liver samples taken
from the non-treated and the 5- and 50-ppm irsogladine
maleate-treated Min mice, respectively. Of the 236 and
238 peaks detected, the levels of 194 and 163 peaks were
lower in the 5- and 50-ppm irsogladine maleate-treated
mice than in the non-treated mice, respectively, with the
levels of 97 and 66 peaks being significantly lower (p <

intestinal neoplastic lesions stronger than its suppression
of other organ-derived neoplastic lesions. Moreover, 50
ppm irsogladine maleate seems no more effective than
5 ppm. We assumed that 5 ppm irsogladine maleate is a
sufficient dose to suppress intestinal polyp formation and
reactive carbonyl species. The data suggested the effects
of 5 ppm irsogladine maleate plateaus, and higher doses
did not efficiently decrease polyp numbers. The data using
0.5 ppm, almost the same dose as in medical practice, is of
interest to investigate in the future.
Among the six gastric mucosal protectants,
irsogladine maleate was found to inhibit NF-κB
transcriptional activity in Caco-2 cells. Similar results
obtained in HCT-15 cells support the reliability of our

results. NF-κB plays a critical role in host defense
responses through the induction of several genes
and is related to inflammatory and immunological
responses [12, 13]. Furthermore, the dysregulation of
NF-κB has been suggested to promote carcinogenesis
[14–17]. Thus, the inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional
activity by irsogladine maleate might be related to its
anti-carcinogenic potential observed in this study. Of
note, the potential inhibition of NF-κB by irsogladine
maleate appears to be weaker than commercially
available NF-κB inhibitors, such as SM-7368. For safety
purposes in the long-term use of cancer chemopreventive
agents, weak inhibitors may be advantageous. In fact, to
our knowledge, no descriptions of severe side effects of

irsogladine maleate treatment have been reported in the
literature.
The nuclear translocation of NF-κB initiates NF-κB
transcriptional activities that result in the expression of
NF-κB responsive genes, such as IL-1β and IL-6 [18–20].
In the polyps, but not the non-polyp intestinal mucosa, of
Min mice, we showed that the mRNA levels of IL-1β and
IL-6 were decreased by irsogladine maleate treatment.
These results suggest that irsogladine maleate may modify
the development of intestinal polyps in Min mice partly
through the NF-κB signaling pathway.
Treatment of Min mice with irsogladine maleate also
lowered hepatic levels of RCs, which form endogenously
by lipid peroxidation. Several RCs, including
acetaldehyde, acrolein, 2-nonenal and HNE, are reported

to cause damage to DNA and proteins, and this damage
is associated with disease development, including chronic
inflammation and carcinogenesis [21–23]. For example,
lipid peroxidation-induced exocyclic DNA adduct levels
are significantly increased in the affected organs of cancerprone subjects suffering from Crohn’s disease, chronic
hepatitis, chronic pancreatitis and familial adenomatous
polyposis [24]. Heptanone-etheno-DNA adducts, or lipid
hydroperoxide-derived adducts, are significantly increased
in Min mice compared with wild type C57BL/6J mice
[25]. Therefore, the suppression of oxidative stress in
Min mice by irsogladine maleate could be related to the
reduction of intestinal tumorigenesis.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that
irsogladine maleate may suppress the development of

intestinal polyps in Min mice, in part through the NF-κB
signaling pathway, suggesting the utility of irsogladine
maleate as a chemopreventive agent. Further in vitro
and in vivo experiments and clinical trials investigating
the suppression of colon carcinogenesis by irsogladine
maleate are needed to provide solid evidence of the
chemopreventive effects of irsogladine maleate in the
colon. Clinical trials using a combination of aspirin and
irsogladine are also required to obtain evidence of the
safety of this combination method - the results of which
may impact colorectal cancer prevention strategies.

cells were also supplemented with MEM Non-Essential
Amino Acids Solution (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Japan).

Animals
Male C57BL/6-ApcMin/+ mice (Min mice) were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (ME, USA).
The mice (n = 4 - 5) were housed in a plastic cage
with sterilized softwood chips as bedding in a barriersustained animal room at 24 ± 2°C and 55% humidity on
a 12 h light/dark cycle. Irsogladine maleate was mixed at
concentrations of 5 and 50 ppm in an AIN-76A powdered
basal diet (CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). We calculated
the dose of 5 and 50 ppm that corresponds to a human
dose. As a medicine, human dosage irsogladine maleate is
4 mg/day, so we used irsogladine maleate at about 10 to a
100 times higher dose compared to the human dose.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Dansyl hydrazine (DH), glyoxal, crotonaldehyde,
2,4-nonadienal
(NDE),
2,4-decadienal
(DDE),
heptadecanal, hexadecanal, irsogladine maleate,
octadecanal, pentadecanal, rebamipide, teprenone,
tetradecanal and troxipide were purchased from Tokyo
Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). The NF-κB inhibitor
SM-7368 was obtained from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt,
Germany). p-Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) and the
RCs including propanal, pentanal, butanal, 2-hexenal,
hexanal, 2-heptenal, heptanal, octanal, 2-nonenal,
nonanal, decanal, undecanal, dodecanal and tridecanal
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). 4-Hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
(HNE), 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE) and 4,5-epoxy-2-decenal
(EDE) were purchased from the Cayman Chemical
Company (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Ecabet sodium
hydrate, p-benzyloxybenzaldehyde (p-BOBA), sofalcone
and other chemicals used in the current study were
purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka,
Japan). 8-Heptadecenal (8-HpDE), 8,11-heptadecadienal
(8,11-HpDDE)
and
8,11,14-heptadecatrienal
(8,11,14-HpDTE) were synthesized by a method
previously described [26, 27]. Secosterol-A and -B were
synthesized according to the procedure reported by
Wentworth et al. [28]. Stock solutions of the RCs and an
internal standard (IS) (p-BOBA, 10 mM) were prepared
separately in acetonitrile and stored at –20°C prior to use.

Animal experiment protocols
Ten male Min mice at 5 weeks of age were given 0,
5 and 50 ppm irsogladine maleate for 8 weeks. All animals
in the same cage were in the same treatment group. Food
and water were available ad libitum. The animals were
observed daily for clinical signs and mortality. Body
weight and food consumption were measured weekly.
At the sacrifice time points, mice were anesthetized, and
blood samples were collected from the abdominal vein.
The levels of serum triglyceride, free fatty acid, and total
cholesterol were measured as previously reported [29].
The intestinal tract was removed and separated into the
small intestine, cecum and colon. The small intestine was
divided into the proximal segment (4 cm in length) and
the proximal (middle) and distal halves of the remainder.
Polyps in the proximal segments were counted and picked
under a stereoscopic microscope; the remaining intestinal
mucosa (non-polyp portion) was removed by scraping,
and the specimens were stored at -80°C for quantitative
real-time PCR analysis. Other segments were opened
longitudinally and fixed flat between sheets of filter
paper in 10% buffered formalin. The numbers and sizes
of polyps and their distributions in the intestine were
assessed with a stereoscopic microscope. The experiments
were performed according to the “Guidelines for Animal
Experiments in the National Cancer Center” and were
approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Committee
for Animal Experimentation of the National Cancer
Center.

Cell culture
Caco-2 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell
line, were purchased from Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma
Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). HCT-15 cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA, USA). Caco-2 and HCT-15 cells were maintained in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated

immunoperoxidase technique after heating with 10
mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0). The primary antibody
was monoclonal mouse anti-PCNA antibody (Ab)
(Calbiochem, CA, USA) at a 100× dilution. As the
secondary Ab, biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) was used at a 200×
dilution. Staining was performed using avidin–biotin
reagents (Vectastain ABC reagents; Vector Laboratories),
3,3′-diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide, and the
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin to facilitate
orientation. As a negative control, consecutive sections
were immunostained without exposure to the primary
Ab. The ratio of PCNA-positive cells was calculated
by the formula % = the number of PCNA positive cells
per polyp / the total number of cells in the polyp (100x
magnification).

treated with the test agents (Figure 1) for 24 h and firefly
and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using
the Bright GLO and Renilla GLO Systems (Promega),
respectively. In the case of the cytokine mixture
experiment, transfected cells were cultured in the presence
of 50 ng/mL TNFα (Perotec, NJ, USA), 5 ng/mL IL-1β
and 50 ng/mL EGF (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., CA, USA) for
24 h and 48 h after 30 min incubation with irsogladine
maleate. The basal luciferase activity of NF-κB in the
control was set as 1.0. The percentage luciferase activity
with each treatment was calculated from the data of
triplicate wells, with values normalized by those of the
Renilla luciferase activity. The data are expressed as the
means ± SD (n = 4).

Reactive carbonyl species extraction and LC/MS
methodology

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analyses

Details of RCs extraction and the LC/MS method
were described previously [30]. Mouse livers (20 mg)
were homogenized in 200 μL of sodium phosphate
buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mM EDTA and
20 μM BHT. Liver homogenates were mixed with an
IS (p-BOBA) (20 pmol) and 400 μL of a chloroform/
methanol (2:1, v/v) solution; the resulting mixture was
vigorously agitated for 1 min then centrifuged at 15,000
rpm for 10 min and the organic phase was collected. The
remaining precipitate and aqueous phases were then mixed
with 400 μL of chloroform/methanol solution (2:1, v/v),
and the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm
for 10 min to obtain the organic phase. The combined
organic phases were mixed with 100 μL of acetonitrile
containing 50 μg of DH and 10 μg of p-toluenesulfonic
acid and incubated for 4 h at ambient temperature in the
absence of light. The mixtures were then evaporated to
dryness in vacuo to give the corresponding derivatized
residues. These residues were dissolved in 200 μL of
acetonitrile, and 5 μL of sample were injected onto the
LC/MS system.
The RC-DH derivatives were separated on a TSKgel Super Octyl column (2.3 μm, 100 × 2.0 mm, TOSOH,
Tokyo, Japan) connected to an Agilent 1200 series HPLC
system and an Agilent G6410B triple quadrupole tandem
mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Mobile phase A
consisted of a 0.1% (v/v) solution of formic acid in water,
and mobile phase B consisted of a 0.1% (v/v) solution of
formic acid in acetonitrile. The linear gradient conditions
were as follows: 20% B at 0 min, 100% B at 10 min,
100% B at 20 min and 20% B at 20.01 min, followed by
a 9.99 min equilibration time. The system was operated at
a constant flow rate of 0.2 mL/min for all of the analyses.
The capillary voltage was set to 4000 V, with a source
temperature of 300°C, a drying gas flow rate of 7 L/min,
a nebulizer gas pressure of 20 psi, the fragmentor at 200
V and collision energies of 13 eV (m/z 275–349), 20 eV

Total RNA was isolated from intestinal polyps and
non-polyp-containing intestinal mucosa using TRIzol
Reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), treated
with DNase (Invitrogen) and 1 μg in a final volume of 20
μL was used for cDNA synthesis using a High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, USA). Real-time PCR was conducted
using a CFX96/384 (BIO RAD, Tokyo, Japan) and Fast
Start Universal SYBR Green Mix (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturers’
instructions. Primer sequences were as follows: IKBKB
(5’-ATC AGG CGA CAG GTG AAC AG and 3’-GGC
CAC AGC AGT TCT CGA A), IL-1β (5’-GAA ATG CCA
CCT TTT GAC AGT G and 3’-TGG ATG CTC TCA
TCA GGA CAG), IL-6 (5’-TGT TCT CTG GGA AAT
CGT GGA and 3’-AAG TGC ATC ATC GTT GTT CAT
ACA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (5’-TTG TCT CCT GCG ACT TCA and 3’CAC CAC CCT GTT GCT GTA). To assess the specificity
of each primer set, amplicons generated from the PCR
reactions were analyzed for melting curves.

Luciferase assays for AP-1, NF-κB, NRF2, p53
and STAT3 transcriptional activity
To measure AP-1, NF-κB, NRF2, p53 and STAT3
transcriptional activity, Caco-2 or HCT-15 colon cancer
cells were seeded in 12-well plates (4.0 × 105 cells/
well). After a 24-h incubation, the cells were transiently
transfected with 1 μg/well of the pAP1-Luc, pNF-κB-Luc,
pNRF2/ARE-Luc, pP53-Luc, pSTAT3-Luc or pTA-Luc
(Signosis Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) reporter plasmid
and 100 ng/well pGL4.73 [hRluc/SV40] control plasmid
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using Polyethylenimine
Max MW 40,000 (PolyScience, Warrington, PA, USA);
transfected cells were cultured for an additional 24 h,

(m/z 350–449) and 29 eV (m/z 450–949). Nitrogen was
used as the collision gas. The RC-DH derivatives were
detected using the selected reaction monitoring (SRM)
mode. This strategy was designed to detect a specific
ion product with an m/z value of 236.1 by CID. This ion
product was assigned to the 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene1-sulfonyl moiety derived from the positively ionized
DH derivatives. The RCs-DH derivatives were therefore
specifically and sensitively detected by monitoring their
transmitting [M+H]+→236.1 transitions. A total of 675
SRM transitions were monitored for each DH-derivatized
sample, with the transitions ranging from m/z 275→236.1
to 949→236.1. For each sample injection, a total of 100
channels were monitored simultaneously. One channel
for each injection was reserved to monitor the transition
of the IS at m/z 460→236.1. Each sample was injected
seven times to complete the monitoring of the 675 SRM
transitions.
