BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone (Len=Dex) is indicated for patients with recurrent=refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who were treated with 1 prior therapy until evidence of disease progression. The objective of the current study
was to determine the efficacy and safety profile of long-term exposure to Len=Dex. METHODS: A total of 50 patients with RRMM
lome (IFM) centers (Lille and Nancy)
who were treated with long-term Len for  2 years from 2 Intergroupe Francophone du Mye
were included in the current study. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 58 years, with 30% of the patients aged > 65 years,
49% having an International Staging System stage of 2 and 3, 12% having severe renal insufficiency, and 8% demonstrating an adverse
result on fluorescence in situ hybridization. Approximately 56% of the patients received treatment with Len=Dex for  3 years. The
median duration of treatment with Len=Dex was 3 years (range, 2 years-7 years). The response rates for partial response or better
and very good partial response or better for the overall cohort were 96% and 74%, respectively, which is similar to patients exposed
to Len for  3 years. With a median follow-up of 4 years, 19 (38%) patients had stopped treatment with Len=Dex. The time to disease
progression rate at 37 months was 78% and 91%, respectively, in patients exposed to Len for 2 years to < 3 years and for  3 years
(P 5 025). The safety profile was manageable, similar to that of Len when administered for a shorter period of time; 16% of patients
had grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, 6% had thrombopenia, 6% had anemia, and 20% experienced thromboembolic events, all of venous
type. The annual incidence rate of second primary malignancy was 1.96% in the current series. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study confirmed that the Len=Dex combination is feasible for long-term use in patients with RRMM, with a significant benefit

INTRODUCTION
Lenalidomide belongs to the class of oral immunomodulatory drugs, demonstrating both tumoricidal and immunomodulatory effects in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and thereby allowing immediate tumor cell death along with sustained disease control when used continuously. Lenalidomide is currently approved in Europe in combination with
dexamethasone (Len=Dex) for the treatment of patients with recurrent and=or refractory MM (RRMM) who have
received at least 1 prior therapy. The Len=Dex combination is approved at the best-tolerated dose of both Len and Dex
until evidence of disease progression.
MM is an incurable plasma cell neoplasm characterized by a high rate of disease recurrence. Despite important
improvements in therapies that have provided significant benefits in survival outcome,1 to the best of our knowledge MM
remains incurable. Nevertheless, long-term disease control is now achievable due to novel therapies such as bortezomib
and Len, provided that not only are the best drugs available to patients, but also that the use of these drugs is optimized so
that patients receive treatment for a long time. Although the short-term profile of response and toxicity of Len is well
known, to the best of our knowledge neither the tolerability profile of long-term exposure to the combination of Len=Dex
nor its effect on response rate and survival have been well described to date.
In the current study, we sought to determine the efficacy and safety profile of long-term exposure to Len=Dex in
patients with RRMM.

Long-Term Exposure to Lenalidomide in RRMM/Fouquet et al

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

A total of 50 patients from 2 centers (Lille and Nancy,
France) were recruited for the current retrospective study.
Patients were required to be aged > 18 years, to be diagnosed with RRMM, and to have received Len for at least 2
consecutive years. The patients also had to have been
treated with Len for  2 years, with a special focus on
those patients receiving Len for  3 years. All patients initiated treatment with a Len=Dex regimen. A thromboprophylaxis was recommended up to 2010, and was then
mandatory afterward, the choice of which was at the discretion of the treating physician. The study was approved
by the ethics committee of regional university hospitals of
Lille, France and was conducted in accordance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Assessment

All patients who were recruited had complete follow-up
records. All response rates were determined according to
International Myeloma Working Group criteria.2
Statistical Analysis

Descriptive data were collected for the cohort. All survival
endpoints were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared with the log-rank test. The estimate
of the relative risk of event and its 95% confidence interval were estimated using the proportional hazards model.
All analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 15.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

and received 4 cycles of either vincristine, doxorubicin,
and Dex (33 patients) or bortezomib and Dex (3 patients)
as induction therapy before transplantation. The remaining 14 patients who were deemed ineligible for transplantation upfront received either 12 cycles of melphalan,
prednisone, and thalidomide (9 patients) or 9 cycles of
melphalan, prednisone, and bortezomib (5 patients).
Len=Dex Regimen

The majority of patients were treated with Len-based regimens early in their disease history and up to the fifth line
of treatment. Overall, 25 patients (50%) received
Len=Dex at the time of first recurrence, 19 patients (38%)
received it at the time of second recurrence, and 6 patients
(12%) received it at the time of subsequent recurrences.
Among elderly patients (those aged > 65 years), Len=Dex
was given at the time of first recurrence in 10 patients
(66%). For all patients, Len was administered orally, at a
starting dose of 10 mg to 25 mg daily (42 patients [84%]
at a dose of 25 mg, 7 patients [14%] at a dose of 15 mg,
and 1 patient [2%] at a dose of 10 mg), from day 1 to day
21 every 28 days. The reasons for dose adaptations were
creatinine clearance in approximately 50% of patients,
and initial altered health status for the remaining patients.
The majority of patients received Dex at a dose of 40 mg
weekly; the remaining patients received Dex at a dose of
10 mg or 20 mg weekly; 40 mg daily from day 1 to day 4
every 28 days; or 40 mg at days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 28
days.
Len Dose Reduction

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

The median age was of the patients 58 years (range, 39
years-79 years), with 15 patients (30%) aged > 65 years
(elderly MM). The male:female ratio was 1.2, 48% of the
patients were International Staging System stage of 2 and
3, 12% had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance
< 30 mL=min), and 8% demonstrated an adverse result
on fluorescence in situ hybridization (del17p and=or
t(4;14)). Twenty-eight patients (56%) received Len=Dex
for  3 years. The characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. The median time from diagnosis to
the start of treatment with Len=Dex was 4.5 years (range,
1 years-16 years) for the overall cohort and 3 years (range,
1 year-8 years) for the elderly patients (those aged
> 65years) (P 5 .05).
Thirty-six patients were eligible and received an autologous transplantation upfront with high-dose melphalan at a dose of 200 mg=m2 as a conditioning regimen,

We first examined whether patients who initiated treatment at a reduced dose of Len (7 patients [14%] at 15 mg
and 1 patient [2%] at 10 mg) had a different treatment
profile for the past 2 and 3 years of treatment with
Len=Dex. We found that this set of patients had a similar
response rate (very good partial response or better
[ VGPR], 79% and 67%, respectively), duration of
treatment (median of 3 years in the 2 groups), and median
time to disease progression (TTP); had a similar discontinuation and dose reduction rate; and demonstrated no
difference in terms of toxicity profile compared with
patients with no initial dose reduction at the start of treatment with Len=Dex (P value was not significant [NS]
across cohorts).
We also studied patients who had a dose reduction
for Len during treatment with Len=Dex. Seventeen
patients (34%) had a dose reduction during the treatment
course of Len=Dex; 13 of 42 patients had their dose
reduced from 25 mg to 15 mg and 10 mg and 4 of 7

patients had their dose reduced from 15 mg to 10 mg.
None of the patients who had a dose reduction experienced any nonhematological toxicity; all had dose reductions related to grade 3 neutropenia and thrombopenia.
We found that this group of patients also had a similar
response rate including  VGPR (71% and 70%, respectively), duration of treatment (median, 3 years in the 2
groups), and median TTP, and no difference in terms of
toxicity profile compared with patients with no dose
reduction during the course of Len=Dex (P value NS
across cohorts).
Safety Profile

Overall, 23 patients (46%) experienced adverse events of
clinical significance (defined as  grade 3 or that required
dose interruption or reduction) with Len: 10 patients
with hematological toxicities (neutropenia in 8 patients,
thrombopenia in 3 patients, and anemia in 3 patients)
and 13 patients with nonhematological toxicities (septic
syndrome in 2 patients, diarrhea in 1 patient, cutaneous
reaction in 2 patients, asthenia in 1 patient, and venous
thromboembolism [VTE] in 7 patients) (Table 2). The
median time to the first occurrence of these adverse events
was 8 months (range, 8 months-27 months) for hematological toxicities and 4 months (range, 1 month-37
months) for nonhematological toxicities. We did not
observe any excess of clinically significant adverse events
in patients who were treated with Len=Dex for  3 years
versus those treated for 2 years to < 3 years. The toxicity
profile was similar across age categories and the number of
previous lines of therapy. The patients who experienced

adverse events with clinical significance had a similar discontinuation rate, similar duration of treatment, similar
response rate including  VGPR (78% for patients who
had hematological toxicities and 61.5% for patients with
nonhematological toxicities), and similar TTP versus
patients who did not experience an adverse event (P value
NS across cohorts).
We also observed 25 patients who experienced clinically significant adverse events with Dex, 9 of whom had
to permanently stop dexamethasone. We did not observe
any excess of Dex-related adverse events with clinical significance in patients treated with the combination of
Len=Dex  3 years versus those treated for 2 years to < 3
years. This toxicity profile of Dex was similar across age
categories and number of previous lines of therapy, and
the patients had a similar discontinuation rate with Len, a
similar duration of treatment with Len, a similar response
rate including and  VGPR, and a similar TTP (P value
NS across cohorts).
Overall, 10 patients (20%) experienced a thromboembolic event (VTE), all of which were of venous type.
The median time to the first occurrence of VTE was 5
months (range, 1 month-28 months), including 4 of 10 in
patients with  3 years of treatment with Len=Dex. With
the exception of 1 patient, all cases of VTE occurred while
the patient was receiving VTE prophylaxis: 5 patients
were receiving aspirin, 2 patients were receiving prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin, and 2
patients were being treated with vitamin K antagonist
(target International Normalized Ratio, 2-3). It is interesting to note that 2 patients in the current series had a previous history of VTE but none experienced VTE while
receiving Len=Dex, which is most likely related to
adequate VTE prophylaxis.
We recorded a second primary malignancy (SPM)
in 3 patients (larynx, lung, and myelodysplastic syndrome), corresponding to an annual incidence rate of
1.96%. The SPMs occurred at a median time of 4 years

67%, respectively, in patients exposed to Len for  3
years, similar to the entire cohort. The observed TTP rate
at 37 months was 78% in patients exposed to Len for 2
years to < 3 years and 91% in patients exposed to Len for
 3 years (odds ratio, 11,052 [95% confidence interval,
1-130]; P 5 .025) (Fig. 1).

Response and Survival

Duration of Treatment

The response rate (overall response rate [ORR] and partial
response or better [ PR]) in the entire cohort was 96%
(n 5 48), including 37 patients (74%) with  VGPR.
The response rate was similar across age categories and
numbers of lines of therapy. The median time to first and
best response was 2 months (range, 1 month-5 months)
and 4.5 months (range, 2 months-9 months), respectively.
With a median follow-up of 4 years, 9 patients (18%) had
developed disease progression. The median TTP was not
reached in the current series, and the estimated 4-year
TTP was 51.5%.
We then focused especially on the patients who had
received Len=Dex for at least 3 years compared with those
who received Len=Dex for at least 2 years but  3 years
(Table 3). The ORR and  VGPR rates were 96% and

Overall, 19 patients had stopped treatment with
Len=Dex, including 9 patients (18%) who stopped
because of toxicity (pneumonia in 2 patients, zoster infection in 1 patient, thrombotic event=pulmonary embolism
in 3 patients, diarrhea in 2 patients, and other toxicities in
1 patient), 9 patients (18%) who stopped because of progression of MM, and 1 patient (0.5%) who decided to
stop treatment. The discontinuation rate of Len=Dex was
similar regardless of whether patients were exposed to Len
for  3 years or for 2 years to < 3 years (14% vs 18%,
respectively; P value was NS). The median duration of
treatment with Len=Dex was 3 years (range, 2 years-7
years) for the overall cohort and 4 years (range, 3 years-7
years) for patients treated with Len for  3 years (P value
was NS). The duration of treatment was similar across age
categories and across the number of lines of therapy.

DISCUSSION
The current study provides estimates of responses, TTP,
and safety in patients with MM who received long-term
treatment with the Len-based regimen in the setting of
disease recurrence. Our data set confirmed the efficacy of
Len in patients with recurrent MM, which was already
reported and published in several previous trials and studies, and demonstrated its use as monotherapy but more

importantly in combination.3 The most frequently tested
combination historically was with Dex, although other
drugs have been tested successfully with Len plus Dex in
recent years.
We observed an acceptable safety profile in patients
who underwent long-term exposure to Len, allowing for a
long median duration of treatment. In the current study,
we observed mainly hematological toxicity that was not
found to be greater in patients according to their time of
exposure to Len ( 3 years vs 2 years to < 3 years), which
confirmed no excess of prolonged cytopenias, especially
neutropenias, in patients with long-term exposure to Len.
We observed a relatively higher-than-expected incidence
of VTE with Len=Dex in patients who had had received
prophylaxis for VTE of normally < 10%.4-7 The vast majority of patients who experienced VTE had Len=Dex initiated before the release of the most recent guidelines, and
we were not able to optimize the VTE risk factors identified at that time. Remarkably, this incidence rate was not
influenced by the length of time the patient was treated
with Len=Dex. Overall, the toxicity profile was similar
across age categories, number of previous recurrences, and
whether patients were exposed to Len for > 3 years, which
is consistent with that reported in previous studies.
With regard to the incidence of SPM in the current
series, not only was the observed incidence rate no greater
than expected in previously published studies, but more
importantly, we did not observe any increased incidence of
SPM in patients with  3 years of treatment with Len. In
the pooled analysis of MM-009 and MM-010 trials8 and
other studies of patients with MM who were treated in the
recurrent setting with Len, the incidence of SPM was low,
no acute myeloid leukemia or B-cell malignancies were
reported, and the incidence of solid-tumor SPMs was no
different from that of the general population, with a comparison based on background cancer rates based on cancer
registry data (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
[SEER] database).9 These data do not compromise the
benefit-risk profile for Len in patients with MM treated in
the recurrent setting, and do not limit long-term exposure
to Len in patients with recurrent MM.
It is interesting to note that we noticed a greaterthan-expected ORR in patients with long exposure to
Len=Dex in the current series; the ORR reported by Dimopoulos et al with Len=Dex in the pooled MM-009 and
MM-010 phase 3 trials in patients with MM was 60% as a
whole and 67% in patients at the time of first recurrence.8
This result can likely be explained by the fact that patients
responding to the combination of Len=Dex were more
likely to benefit longer from the combination, and thus to
3684

remain on Len=Dex and be recruited in the current
study.10 All patients who had previously developed disease
recurrence or whose disease became refractory to Len=Dex
before reaching 2 years of treatment were excluded as per
the inclusion criteria in the current study. One might also
consider that our studied population was characterized
with a good prognostic because we noticed a lower incidence rate of < 10% among patients with adverse fluorescence in situ hybridization cytogenetic findings (deletion of
17p and=or translocation t(4;14)) in the current study.
Other studies have reported greater ORRs in patients
exposed to Len long term. Srivastava and al studied the
combination of Len=Dex as initial therapy in 286 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed MM, and observed an
ORR of 72% in the entire cohort, including 26% of
patients with  VGPR, and 86% and 46%, respectively,
among patients who stayed on therapy for  12 months
(93 patients; 32%), thus demonstrating an improvement
in the response rate with long-term exposure to
Len=Dex.11
Another key finding of the current study was the
longer median TTP on Len=Dex noted in patients treated
for  3 years versus those treated for 2 to < 3 years,
regardless of the ORR of either cohort. These results
could be explained by the cellular effect of Len on tumor
cells, which suggests that its chronic use may be beneficial
to patients with myeloma.12 Len exerts both a direct tumoricidal and an immunomodulatory effect in patients
with myeloma, and it has been suggested that although
the tumoricidal effects allow for an initial response by immediate tumor cell death, the immunomodulatory effects
may be responsible for sustained disease control.12 Both
mechanisms, direct inhibition of tumoral cell growth and
induction of apoptosis, were highlighted in previous studies, along with immunomodulation, including inhibition
of myeloid cells and costimulation of lymphoid cells. An
antiangiogenic effect also has been reported. Harousseau
et al10 demonstrated that approximately one-half of those
patients who initially demonstrated a PR eventually
obtained a complete response or near-complete response
after additional cycles of treatment, suggesting deepening
responses with continued treatment, making their study
the first to our knowledge to highlight the importance of
prolonged therapy. San Miguel et al13 also reported that
continuous Len=Dex treatment after the achievement of
best response significantly prolonged survival compared
with earlier discontinuation. Together, these data highlight the importance of continuing therapy with Len=Dex
provided that patients are able to tolerate a Len-based
regimen.

Long-Term Exposure to Lenalidomide in RRMM/Fouquet et al

The analysis of data from the MM-009 and MM010 trials also demonstrated that the patients who
received full-dose therapy with Len=Dex for at least 12
months had a significantly higher complete response rate,
along with higher progression-free survival and overall
survival compared with those who had an earlier dose
reduction.14 These data were confirmed by Oehrlein and
al in a retrospective analysis of 67 patients from a single
center who were treated with the Len=Dex combination
for RRMM.15 In their study, patients treated with
Len=Dex for at least 12 months had a higher overall survival compared with those who discontinued treatment
before 12 months (42.9 months vs 14.4 months, respectively; P < .0001). We have performed similar analysis,
although our data did not reach significance, which is
most likely related to the limited number of patients in
the current study. Based on these results, long-term treatment at the best-tolerated doses of both Len and Dex may
be recommended until evidence of disease progression.16
Although long-term exposure to Len appears to be
more and more beneficial, several questions remain
regarding the addition of Dex in the long term and lowering doses of Len for the prolonged control of myeloma tumor cells. Although Len acts synergistically with Dex to
inhibit myeloma cell proliferation in vitro, it has been suggested that the immunomodulatory effects could be
antagonized by Dex,16 suggesting that maintaining longterm treatment with Len could be more important than
Dex once the disease is controlled.17 Furthermore, it
appears that even low doses of Len could be sufficient to
preserve its immunomodulatory properties and provide
adequate disease control.
However, Williams and al found a significantly positive association between a higher starting dose of Len and
a longer duration of treatment duration in a series of 1286
patients with RRMM who were treated with Len=Dex at
185 treatment centers throughout the United Kingdom.18
Their findings remind us that even if individual dose
adjustments of Len can help to maintain a long-term
treatment, a high starting dose is essential for initial tumor
control.
The results of the current study confirmed that
Len=Dex is safe in patients undergoing long-term treatment in the setting of RRMM, and we have observed a
significant benefit in terms of TTP for prolonged treatment with Len=Dex in patients with RRMM. In the current study, there was a benefit noted in pursuing
treatment with Len for > 3 years, highlighting that
Len=Dex was approved until disease progression for all
patients with myeloma in the setting of recurrent disease.
