BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is well known for its critical role in cell survival and cancer development. It also plays an important role in hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. In
this study, the authors investigated the association of MMP-2 polymorphisms with treatment efficacy and the occurrence of severe toxicity in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were receiving first-line, platinumbased chemotherapy. METHODS: A pharmacogenetic association study was performed in 663 Chinese patients who
had inoperable stage III/IV NSCLC and were receiving first-line, platinum-based regimens. Information about objective response, progression-free survival, overall survival, grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea/vomiting), and
hematologic toxicity (neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) was available. Sixteen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMP-2 were assessed. RESULTS: In 7 polymorphisms, significant associations were observed with
the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. The variant homozygotes of reference SNP rs12934241 exhibited the most
significant effect on the risk of neutropenia, leading to an incidence rate that increased from 12.3% (for the C/C genotype) to 50% (for the T/T genotype; odds ratio, 8.33; P ¼ 8.8  105). Stratified analyses indicated that rs12934241
exhibited a much stronger influence in the cisplatin-gemcitabine regimen subgroup than subgroups that received
other regimens (Pinteraction ¼ .003). Further haplotype analyses produced results that were consistent with results
from single-SNP analyses. However, no significant association was observed between MMP-2 polymorphisms and
treatment efficacy, including response rate, clinical benefit, progression-free survival, and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors’ knowledge, this study provides the first evidence for a predictive role of MMP-2 polymorphisms in the variability of severe chemotherapy-related neutropenia among Chinese patients with platinum-treated,

INTRODUCTION
Platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin), in combination with navelbine, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel, has been widely used
as first-line chemotherapy for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).1 These platinum-based regimens bring modest benefits but also adverse effects, which may cause distressing symptoms and prevent further therapies. Studies have suggested that efficacy and toxicity of platinum-based chemotherapy vary greatly between individuals.2,3 Thus, the

identification of predictive markers for optimal individualized therapy with better efficacy and minimal toxicity
remains a continuing challenge in NSCLC treatment.
Recent clinical studies suggest a large potential for
genomic findings in predicting treatment outcomes.4-6
Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) (also known as gelatinase A), the main physiologic mediator of extracellular
matrix (ECM) degradation,7 which is important in cell
proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis,8-10 is playing an increasingly critical role in pharmacogenetic research of NSCLC treatment.11 Accumulating
evidence has demonstrated that MMP-2 exhibits a high
level of expression in many human tumors and plays an
important role in cancer initiation and development.12 In
lung cancer, activated MMP-2 can confer apoptosis resistance by modulating Fas-mediated death signaling; downregulating MMP-2; increasing caspase-3, caspase-8, and
caspase-9 activities; degrading the BH3-interacting domain death agonist Bid; and releasing cytochrome c.8
MMP-2 also directly modulates the activity of several proliferation and apoptosis-related growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factor, and
fibroblast growth factors.13-16 In addition, functional and
mechanistic studies have demonstrated that MMP-2 plays
an important role in hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression not only by promoting migration of hematopoietic stem cells through the
ECM but also by facilitating the release of pivotal regulatory factors (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, insulin-like
growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta) into
the bone marrow microenvironment.10,17-20 This suggests
a potential impact of MMP-2 on the incidence and severity of drug-related hematologic toxicity.
Several studies have suggested that MMP-2 polymorphisms are associated significantly with lung cancer
risk.14,21 These functional differences between polymorphic variants can strongly influence gene transcriptional
activity and function.22 Other reports have demonstrated
that MMP-2 expression is associated significantly with tumor metastasis and a poor prognosis in patients with
NSCLC.23,24 However, in epidemiologic studies of polymorphisms, the issue has remained controversial.25-30 It is
noteworthy that there are no reports concerning the correlation between MMP-2 genetic variants and the toxicity
of cancer chemotherapy. In the current study, we investigated 16 tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
the MMP-2 gene and assessed the association of the polymorphisms with grade 3 or 4 toxicities and treatment efficacy in 663 Chinese patients with stage III/IV NSCLC

3588

who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
The objective of this work was to explore the potential
impact of MMP-2 variants on the treatment of advanced
NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Recruitment
All patients enrolled in the study were Chinese living in
China and had histologic stage IIIA through IV NSCLC
diagnosed at the Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai
Zhongshan Hospital, and Shanghai Changhai Hospital
between March 2005 and January 2010. The following
criteria were used to identify eligible patients3: 1)
informed consent available and adherence to the treatment schedule; 2) age 18 years; 3) histologically confirmed, stage IIIA through IV NSCLC with the presence
of a measurable and evaluable lesion; 4) receiving firstline, platinum-based chemotherapy (no prior surgery,
radiotherapy, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy for this
cancer); 5) no other prior malignancy in the past 5 years
except treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, treated cervical
carcinoma in situ, or any other ‘‘cured’’ malignant tumor;
6) an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status between 0 and 2; 7) absolute neutrophil count
1.5  109/L, platelet count 100  109/L, serum creatinine 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, creatinine
clearance 60 mL/minute, and alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels 1.5 times the upper limit of normal;
8) no active congestive heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias
requiring medical regimen; 9) no uncontrolled clinical
infections; and 10) no other critical medical or psychological factors that might influence the treatment schedule.
Clinical data for all patients were recorded systematically at entry, including sex, age at diagnosis, smoking
status, clinical stage, and tumor histology. Medical history
interview, physical examination, and laboratory investigations were done before any treatment course was started.
The complete medical record (including progress notes of
the treating oncologist and nurses) was available and
reviewed. Survival statistics were collected from several
sources, including follow-up calls, the Social Security
Death Index, and inpatient and outpatient clinical medical records. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Fudan University and the
participating Hospitals. Investigators were blinded to the
genotype status of the patients.
Chemotherapy toxicity was assessed twice weekly
according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common

Cancer

MMP-2 Polymorphisms and Chemotherapy/Zhao et al

Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0. The worst toxicity record
during the initial 2 cycles of therapy was collected for
analysis. Toxicities included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and vomiting. Severe hematologic
toxicity included grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, or
thrombocytopenia. Severe gastrointestinal toxicity
included grade 3 or 4 nausea or vomiting. No grade 5 toxicity (death) was observed in this study.
Patient responses to the treatment were evaluated after the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version
1.0) guidelines, which classify the responses into 4 categories: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable
disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD).3 The response
rate corresponds to the percentage of patients with CR or
PR, whereas clinical benefit (CR þ PR þ SD) represents
the absence of PD.31 Progression-free survival (PFS) was
calculated from the date the patient started chemotherapy
to the date of disease progression or death (whichever
occurred first) or the last progression-free follow-up.
Overall survival (OS) calculated from the date of first
chemotherapy to the date of death or last follow-up.
Chemotherapy Regimens
All patients enrolled in this study were considered inoperable and, thus, received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy as follows: either cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or
carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5, both administered on day 1 every 3 weeks, in combination with navelbine 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks, or
gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks,
or paclitaxel, 175 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks, or docetaxel 75 mg/m2, on day 1 every 3 weeks. A few patients
received other platinum-based treatment. All chemotherapeutic drugs were administered intravenously, and all
included patients were treated for 2 to 6 cycles.
Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 Single-Nucleotide
Polymorphism Selection and Genotyping
The human MMP-2 gene is approximately 27.52 kb in size
and is located on chromosome 16q13-q21. Genotype data
on the MMP-2 gene region (including 2 kb upstream) from
the Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB) population were downloaded from the phase 2 HapMap SNP database (available
at http://www.hapmap.org/ [access August, 2011]), and
tag-SNPs were selected in Haploview software (available at
http://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview; [access August,
2011]) using a minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoff of 0.05
and a correlation coefficient (r2) threshold of 0.8. In this

Cancer

July 15, 2012

study, a total of 16 tag-SNPs were selected to represent
genetic variation of 37 SNPs in MMP-2.
Blood samples were obtained in ethylene diamine tetracetic acid tubes from patients at the time of recruitment.
Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA
Maxi Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). All SNPs
selected were genotyped using iSelect HD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, Calif) with the following quality-control
criteria: genotyping call rate of SNP, >0.95; MAF, >0.05;
and GenCall score, >0.2. All SNPs were genotyped successfully, except 3 probes that failed in the bead chip synthesis process. Therefore, a polymerase chain reactionSNaPshot method was used to supplement the genotyping
data from the 3 failed polymorphisms (reference SNPs [rs]
rs243844, rs243849, and rs9928731). All selected SNPs
had call rates >0.95. Concordance between replicates was
>99.9%. GenomeStudioV2010.1 (Illumina) and GeneMap-per v 4.0 (Applied Biosystems) software were used to
analyze the data and prepare reports.
Statistical Analysis
The analyses were specified to investigate the relations
between MMP-2 polymorphisms and grade 3 or 4 toxicity
and the clinical efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy
(response rate [CR þ PR], clinical benefit [CR þ PR þ
SD], PFS, and OS). Demographic, clinical, and pathologic
characteristics were tested univariately against outcomes
and genotypes using chi-square tests or log-rank tests,
depending on which variables were analyzed. Association
of each genetic variant with dichotomous outcomes were
estimated by odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) using univariate logistic regression, assuming
an additive model (zero, 1, or 2 copies of variant alleles).
Polymorphisms that had P values < .05 in univariate analysis were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis
in different genetic models (codominant, additive, dominant, recessive), with adjustment of patient characteristics
(sex, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, TNM stage, histologic type, smoking status,
and chemotherapy regimens) to yield P < .1 in univariate
analysis. Further stratification analyses for the significant
polymorphisms were then performed, and differences in
outcomes between characteristic subgroups according to
genetic variants were investigated by calculating P values
for interaction. The association between genotype and survival was examined by hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs
using univariate a Cox proportional hazards regression
model. Polymorphisms with P < .05 in univariate analysis
were selected for inclusion in the multivariate analysis. For

statistical analyses, the SPSS statistical software package was
used (version 15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the SNPs was examined
using D0 and r2. Haplotype blocks were defined according
to Gabriel et al in Haploview software (Broad Institute of
Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass).32 Individual haplotype frequencies were estimated based on the Bayesian algorithm using the PHASE
2.0: http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/resources/phase/
program (version 2.0.2).33 Haplotype-outcome associations were evaluated for each block using HAPLO.STATS
package in R-plus (available at http://cran.r-project.org/
web/packages/haplo.stats/index.html; [access August,
2011]).34 All P values reported were 2-sided. A P value <
.05 was considered statistically significant, whereas a level
of P < .1 was considered marginal. To protect results
against multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was
made for the P value from the results of any SNP by multiplying the number of SNPs tested for the gene.2

RESULTS
All 663 patients in our study had stage III through IV
NSCLC and received 2 to 6 cycles of first-line, platinumbased chemotherapy except for 5 patients who died of disease progression before treatment was completed. The
main patient characteristics and clinical outcomes are summarized in Table 1, and the correlations between variables
were tested univariately using chi-square tests or log-rank
tests, depending on the tested variables (data not shown).
Of the 663 patients enrolled, hematologic toxicity was evaluated in 646 patients, gastrointestinal toxicity was evaluated in 642 patients, and the objective response rate was
assessed in 657 patients. A few patients were not included
because of loss to follow-up during first-line chemotherapy.
For the survival analysis, at the time of final data collection
(March 2011), the median follow-up was 32.0 months.
The median PFS was 6.5 months, and the median survival
was 18.4 months, similar to values in the literature.35 All
16 tag-SNPs involved were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > .05), and the observed allele frequency was consistent with values in the published literature (Table 2). No
significant associations between polymorphisms and
patient characteristics were observed (data not shown).

univariate logistic regression, assuming an additive model
(data not shown). Seven of the 16 SNPs with P values <
.05 in univariate analysis were examined further in multivariate logistic regression analysis, and all 7 retained significance (Table 3). We observed that those 7 SNPs had
significant associations with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (the
variant homozygotes of rs1477017, rs17301608,
rs12934241, rs1992116, and rs11639960 displayed a risk
effect for neutropenia; whereas homozygous rs243847
and rs243844 exhibited a protective influence on neutropenia). Among these, the most significant correlation was
observed between the variant homozygotes of rs12934241
and the risk of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (incidence rate,
50% vs 12.3%; OR, 8.33; 95% CI, 2.89-24.01; P ¼ 8.8
 105  16 ¼ .0014 < .05; remaining significant after
Bonferroni correction). Thus, further stratification analyses between rs12934241 and severe neutropenia were performed for patient characteristic subgroups (Table 4).
Because 100 patients were sufficient to investigate the
associations between rs12934241 (MAF, 0.16) and grade
3 or 4 neutropenia with 90% power to detect a minimum
OR of 1.83 at the 2-sided 5% level of significance, several
subsets were selected for stratified examination (total,
>100 patients): aged 58 years, aged >58 years, men,
women, never-smokers, ever-smokers, stage IIIB or IV
disease, histologic type of adenocarcinoma or squamous
cell carcinoma, patients receiving cisplatin-navelbine, cisplatin-gemcitabine, or carboplatin-paclitaxel. The rs12934241

variant had a similar effect in all the other patient characteristic subgroups, whereas it exhibited a much stronger influence on severe neutropenia occurrence in the cisplatingemcitabine subset than the other 2 regimens (cisplatingemcitabine subgroup, 80% vs 3.3%; OR, 8.39; 95% CI,
2.78-25.29; P ¼ 1.6  104), and with a statistically significant interaction was observed (compared between platinum
plus gemcitabine or platinum plus other agents; P ¼ .003).
We also observed significant associations of
rs1992116 with severe hematologic toxicity (P ¼ .017),
neutropenia (P ¼ .033), and anemia (P ¼ .002). Further
stratified analyses were not performed because of insufficient subgroup sample size. No significant association was
observed between MMP-2 polymorphisms and grade 3 or
4 gastrointestinal toxicity or thrombocytopenia.
Efficacy

Associations between each MMP-2 polymorphism
and treatment efficacy (response rate, clinical benefit,
PFS, OS), were assessed using univariate logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards regression, assuming an
additive model (data not shown). Although 2 polymorphisms had marginally significant correlations with PFS
(rs865094, P ¼ .091; rs243843, P ¼ .071), there was no
statistically significant association between MMP-2 polymorphisms and treatment efficacy. For rs12934241, the
most significant variant in toxicity analysis, the variant
homozygote had a longer PFS and OS than the wild-type

Pairwise LD relations between MMP-2 polymorphisms
are illustrated in Figure 1. The SNP rs12934241 was
observed in high LD with rs1477017, rs17301608, and
rs1992116 (0.993 < D0 < 1.000; 0.304 < r2 < 0.494),
all of which were associated significantly with severe
chemotherapy-related neutropenia. High LD also was

observed for rs11639960, rs17301608, and rs1477017
(0.765 < D0 < 0.986; 0.404 < r2 < 0.687). In addition,
rs243847 and rs243844, both of which demonstrated a
protective effect on severe neutropenia, were correlated
with each other (r2 ¼ 0.416 with each other).
According to the method described by Gabriel et al,
3 blocks were defined for further analyses between haplotypes and severe neutropenia. In multivariate logistic
regression analysis adjusted for type of treatment regimen,
significant correlations of haplotypes with severe neutropenia were observed in all 3 blocks (Table 6). In the cisplatin-gemcitabine subset, a global score test revealed much

DISCUSSION
Epidemiologic studies have indicated that sequence variations within MMP-2 may strongly influence the risk of
several diseases, including lung cancer.14,21 It was
reported recently that rs1477017, rs17301608, and
rs11639960 displayed associations with the risk of prostate cancer.36 More recently, it also was demonstrated that
rs1992116, rs1477017, and rs17301608 strongly influence functional outcome after stroke.37 Several other
reports demonstrated that 2 variants (rs243866 and
rs243865) in the gene promoter region were associated
significantly with the risk of both lung cancer and gastric
cancer.14,28 In addition, there is experimental evidence

concerning the biologic functions of these 2 latter variants.22 However, pharmacogenetic studies related to
MMP-2 polymorphisms are few; and, to our knowledge,
no reports have focused on drug-related adverse events. In
the current study, the tag-SNP selection strategy was chosen to assess a broader spectrum of MMP-2 polymorphisms and to characterize the effects of whole gene
variants on chemotherapy-related outcomes, including
both toxicity and treatment efficacy. The reportedly significant variants, rs243866 and rs243865, were not noted
because of their low MAF in the Chinese population (<
0.05; National Center for Biotechnology Information
[NCBI] dbSNP database; NCBI, Bethesda, Md).
In our study, significant associations were observed
between MMP-2 polymorphisms and the occurrence of
grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Single-SNP analysis identified 7
SNPs that were associated significantly with severe neutropenia, and rs12934241 had the strongest influence,
leading to an incidence rate that increased from 12.3%
(C/C genotype) to 50% (T/T genotype; (P ¼ 8.8 
105). Moreover, LD analysis displayed high levels of LD

between rs12934241 and other significant SNPs, suggesting the important role of rs12934241. Consistent findings
were exhibited in stratified analyses of both single SNPs
and haplotypes. It is noteworthy that we observed a stronger influence of that polymorphism on severe neutropenia
in the cisplatin-gemcitabine subgroup, and the interaction
was statistically significant (P ¼ .003). Our results suggest
a more important role for MMP-2 in the cytotoxic mechanism of DNA-damaging agents (eg, gemcitabine) than
other kinds of drugs, such as microtubule-targeted agents
(eg, navelbine, paclitaxel).
To our knowledge, rs12934241, located in intron 5,
has not been reported in previous association studies.
Accumulating reports previously demonstrated that
intronic polymorphisms located in splice donor, acceptor,
or cis-regulatory element sites may perform an important
role through modulating messenger RNA (mRNA)splicing and gene expression.38-40 However, we know of no ex-

perimental evidence supporting the same hypothesis for
MMP-2 variants. Conversely, it is likely that rs12934241
is not a functional polymorphism but, rather, is a substitute for the underling causative variant in the same region.
For example, we observed that the rs12934241 variant
was in perfect LD (D0 ¼ 1.00; r2 ¼ 1.00) with a synonymous polymorphism (glycine [Gly]226Gly; rs1132896;
phase 2 HapMap SNP database). Synonymous variants
do not lead to altered coding sequences but could affect
mRNA stability and protein translation efficiency by converting a high-usage codon to a low-usage codon.2,41 It
also has been confirmed that silent SNPs influence protein
conformation and substrate affinity.42,43 It is noteworthy
that 1 study demonstrated the ability of chemotherapy to
disturb hematopoietic cell proliferation and survival
through disrupted translation of MMP-2,44 suggesting
the importance of the MMP-2 translation process in
chemotherapy-induced hematologic toxicity. Further

3595

Original Article

studies will be required to identify the actual causative
genetic variation. The findings that MMP-2 plays an important role in hematopoietic progenitor cell recruitment
and bone marrow microenvironment modulation suggest
that the genetic variant tagged by rs12934241 leads to inhibition of MMP-2 and the disruption of hematopoietic
recovery after chemotherapy-related myelosuppression.
It is noteworthy that, although MMP-2 polymorphisms had significant associations with the incidence of
adverse events, they were not correlated significantly with
the efficacy of platinum-based treatment, suggesting a different mechanism of MMP-2 function between tumor
cells and normal cells. A recent meta-analysis called into
question the prognostic significance of MMP-2 expression in tumor cells and stromal cells in patients with
NSCLC: MMP-2 expression in tumor cells was a poor
prognostic factor, whereas this was not the case in stromal
cells.23 In analyses of polymorphisms, several reports have
suggested that a functional variant of MMP-2, although it
demonstrated an association with cancer risk and had an
impact on gene expression, failed to demonstrate a significant correlation with tumor metastasis and prognosis in
patients with gastric cancer.14,21,22,27-29 Considering the
abnormally high level of MMP-2 expression in NSCLC
tumor cells,12,45 it has been suggested that MMP-2
expression and function may be modulated by some other
factors in the background of carcinoma,46 and genetic variants may not play a major role in this situation.
Although the new finding of an association between
MMP-2 polymorphisms and severe neutropenia is interesting, this study is limited by the lack of validation in an
independent population. Another limitation is the insufficient sample size in the subgroup analyses. This may lead
to a failure to detect a small effect from SNPs of low penetrance on a low toxicity incidence (ie, grade 3 or 4 anemia
or thrombocytopenia). Several other important regimens
(eg, a platinum with docetaxel) were not involved in subgroup analysis, also because of limited numbers. However, in terms of the stratified analysis of rs12934241 and
severe neutropenia involved in this study, the sample size
was large enough (for rs12934241, the MAF was 0.16;
assuming n ¼ 100 and a ¼ .05, the analysis had 90%
power to detect a minimum OR of 1.83 for grade 3 or 4
neutropenia).
In the current pharmacogenetic study, the sample
size is large, and the recruitment criteria are strict. All
663 patients enrolled are Han Chinese and were treated
in 3 medical centers that shared identical criteria for
patient recruitment and clinical data collection, thereby

3596

limiting the potential confounding effects of genetic
and clinical heterogeneity. The results focused mainly
on neutropenia, which is an objective and comparable
outcome. Therefore, these findings do not appear have
been obtained by chance. Because the frequencies of
MMP-2 polymorphisms are quite different among ethnic populations (eg, the frequency of the rs12934241 T
allele is much lower in the Han Chinese population
[CHB, 0.11] than in the Western Europe population
[Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe from the Center for the Study of Human
Polymorphisms, 0.40] according to the HapMap database); and, considering the retrospective nature of this
study, independent prospective validations in different
populations will be required.
It is well known that severe chemotherapy-related
neutropenia, frequently leading to serious infections,
greatly influences patients’ quality of life, further therapy,
and survival. Thus, biomarkers for predicting neutropenia
and risk, if validated, would be clinically significant. In
the current study, we investigated the relation between
MMP-2 polymorphisms and clinical outcomes in Han
Chinese with NSCLC who received first-line, platinumbased chemotherapy and identified several significant
genetic variants (especially rs12934241). However, there
was no significant association with treatment efficacy, and
the only significance was for the incidence of grade 3 or 4
chemotherapy-related toxicity, especially neutropenia.
This finding may provide insight not only into the plausible role of MMP-2 in the pathogenesis and treatment of
neutropenia but also into the predictive effect of the
genetic variant on adverse events; thus, these findings
potentially may have significant benefit for the individualized treatment of NSCLC in the future.
