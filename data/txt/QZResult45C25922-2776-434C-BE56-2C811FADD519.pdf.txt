Abstract
Primary and acquired resistance to the breast cancer drug trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a significant clinical
problem. Here, we report enhanced activation of downstream signaling pathways emanating from the growth
factor receptors erbB2, erbB3, and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer cells. Interactions between IGF-IR and erbB2 or erbB3 occur exclusively in trastuzumab-resistant
cells, where enhanced erbB2-erbB3 interactions are also observed. Moreover, these three receptors form a heterotrimeric complex in resistant cells. erbB3 or IGF-IR knockdown by short hairpin RNA–mediated strategies
upregulates p27kip1, inactivates downstream receptor signaling, and resensitizes resistant cells to trastuzumab.
Our findings reveal a heterotrimer complex with a key role in trastuzumab resistance. On the basis of our results, we propose that trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer might be overcome by therapeutic strategies
that jointly target erbB3, erbB2, and IGF-IR. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1204–14. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) against erbB2 receptor, was the first erbB2targeted therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(1). Trastuzumab has been successfully used in early-stage
and metastatic breast cancer therapy of patients with
erbB2-overexpressing tumors as monotherapy (2, 3) and in
combination with other agents (4–6). Unfortunately, not all
breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress erbB2 respond to trastuzumab, and the majority of patients who
achieve an initial response to trastuzumab-based regimens
develop resistance within 1 year (7, 8). These observations
indicate that both primary and acquired resistances to trastuzumab are common.
Several mechanisms contributing to trastuzumab resistance have been reported (9–11). These can be divided into
two general categories. (a) Inability or reduced capacity of
trastuzumab binding to erbB2—trastuzumab is unable to
interfere with the erbB2 heterodimers by epidermal growth

factor receptor (EGFR) or erbB3 (12–15). Elevated expression of membrane-bound glycoprotein mucin-4 directly interacts with erbB2 and sterically hinders erbB2 from
binding to trastuzumab (16, 17). A truncated form of erbB2
receptor (called p95ErbB2) through either an alternative initiation of protein translation or cleavage by proteases does
not bind to trastuzumab (18, 19). (b) Activation of downstream signaling pathways leads to trastuzumab resistance.
Studies have identified the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt signaling as the major determinant of trastuzumab resistance (20, 21). PTEN activation is critical for trastuzumab-induced tumor inhibition, and loss of PTEN
function predicts trastuzumab resistance (7, 22). As an important tumor suppressor, PTEN antagonizes PI3K function
and negatively regulates Akt activities (23). The fact that
loss of PTEN function leads to activation of PI3K/Akt signaling further emphasizes the importance of PI3K/Akt
pathway in trastuzumab resistance. In addition, reduced
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27kip1 expression
and elevated CDK2 activity have been reported in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells (24). Cellular localization
of p27kip1 might be important, as trastuzumab-resistant
cells showed loss of nuclear p27kip1 (25). The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Met activation or overexpression protects
erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells against trastuzumab (26). Trastuzumab-induced growth inhibition was lost
in breast cancer cells that overexpressed both insulin-like
growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and erbB2 (27). However,
the expression of IGF-IR per se does not predict trastuzumab resistance in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer patients (28), suggesting that activation of IGF-IR signaling
may be more important than its expression for development of resistance to trastuzumab. Indeed, IGF-I signaling

resulted in elevated expression of the p27kip1 ubiquitin ligase SKP2, leading to decreased p27kip1 and loss of growth
arrest in the presence of trastuzumab (29). Furthermore,
cross-talk occurs between IGF-IR and erbB2, and IGF-IR
physically interacts with erbB2 and induces activation of
erbB2 in trastuzumab-resistant, but not trastuzumab-sensitive, breast cancer cells (30).
Given the reportedly complex interactions between the
RTK ligands, receptors, and signaling pathways, it is perhaps
not surprising that erbB2-overexpressing breast cancers have
shown variable responses to trastuzumab. Overexpression of
other erbB receptors may be one mechanism of trastuzumab
resistance (31–33). Thus, novel strategies simultaneously targeting multiple receptors or signaling pathways have drawn
great interest for breast cancer therapy. Coexpression of
erbB3 and erbB2 is frequently observed in breast cancers
(34) and cell lines (35). erbB2 requires erbB3 to promote
breast cancer cell proliferation (36), and erbB3 plays a critical
role in breast cancer development driven by erbB2 amplification/overexpression (37). Elevated expression of erbB3 and
its association with erbB2 promote mammary tumorigenesis
in c-neu transgenic models (38, 39). We have recently shown
that erbB3 contributes to erbB2-mediated antiestrogen resistance (40). Ligand-induced dimerization between erbB3 and
erbB2 is one likely mechanism of trastuzumab resistance
(41). Considering the importance of both IGF-IR and erbB3
in erbB2-mediated breast cancer development, it is conceivable to predict that cotargeting IGF-IR and erbB3 signalings
may ultimately enhance the therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancers; however, the
relationship between erbB3 and IGF-IR in trastuzumab resistance remains unknown. Our current studies suggest that
both erbB3 and IGF-IR work cooperatively with erbB2, and
these three RTKs may interact with each other to form more
complicated, multiple receptor complexes, which promote
activation of the downstream signalings contributing to trastuzumab resistance.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech, Inc.) was obtained from the University of Colorado
Hospital pharmacy. MISSION Non-target short hairpin RNA
(shRNA), which does not target human and mouse genes,
control vector (pLKO.1-ConshRNA), pLKO.1 containing human IGF-IR shRNA (pLKO.1-IGF-IRshRNA), and pLKO.1 containing human erbB2 shRNA (pLKO.1-ErbB2shRNA) were
purchased from Sigma. pLKO.1 containing human erbB3
shRNA (pLKO.1-ErbB3shRNA) and lentivirus packaging plasmids pCMV-VSVG and pCMV-ΔA.9 were kindly provided by
Dr. Haihua Gu (Department of Pathology, University of Colorado Denver).
Antibodies were from the following sources: erbB2 (EMD
Biosciences); erbB3 polyclonal antibody (Abcam); erbB3 and
phosphorylated erbB2 (P-erbB2) mAbs (LabVision); IGF-IRβ,
phosphorylated erbB3 (P-erbB3), phosphorylated Src (P-Src;
Tyr416), Src, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, phosphorylated

mitogen-activated protein kinase (P-MAPK), MAPK, Akt, and
phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt; Ser473; Cell Signaling Technology); p27kip1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP; BIOMOL Research Laboratories); and
β-actin (Sigma). All other reagents were purchased from
Sigma unless otherwise specified.
Cells and cell culture. Human breast cancer cell lines
SKBR3 and BT474 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma).
Both cell lines and their trastuzumab-resistant sublines were
cultured in a 37°C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air
and 5% CO2 and split twice a week.
Production of lentivirus containing specific shRNA. The
lentiviral vector pLKO.1-ConshRNA, pLKO.1-ErbB3shRNA,
pLKO.1-IGF-IRshRNA, or pLKO.1-ErbB2shRNA and lentivirus packaging plasmids pCMV-VSVG and pCMV-ΔA.9 were
cotransfected into 293T cells with FuGene 6 (Roche Diagnostics). After 24 h, the culture media were replaced with
fresh medium. The virus in conditioned medium was harvested in 3 consecutive days and filtered with low-protein
binding filters (Millex-HV, 0.45-mm polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore Corp.) before they were aliquoted and stored
at −80°C freezer.
Gene silencing with the lentivirus encoding specific
shRNA. Before infection, the ConshRNA, ErbB3shRNA, IGFIRshRNA, or ErbB2shRNA lentivirus-containing media
(5 mL) were thawed completely at room temperature. Another 5 mL of fresh medium containing polybrene (8 μg/mL)
were added into the virus-containing media, which were
used to replace the culture media of interested cells. After
24 h, the virus-infected cells were selected by puromycin
(1 μg/mL) for 48 h and subjected to required assays.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays were performed as
described (39). Briefly, equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at 4°C followed by incubation with protein A or G–agarose (Roche Diagnostics) at
4°C overnight. The immunoprecipitates or equal amounts of
cell lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved by
SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and
probed with primary antibody. After the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch), the signals were detected using
the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Life
Science).
Detection of protein complex with native PAGE analysis.
Breast cancer cells were cultured in the absence of trastuzumab for 24 h. After collection and lysis, equal amounts of cell
lysates were prepared in sample buffer without SDS and resolved by a native PAGE in Tris-glycine running buffer without SDS. After transferring proteins from the native PAGE to
nitrocellulose membranes, the membranes were probed with
primary antibody as indicated in the figure legends and followed by Western blot analysis.
Cell proliferation assay. The CellTiter96 AQ Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation kit (Promega) was used to determine
cell viability as described (39, 40, 42). Briefly, cells were plated

onto 96-well plates for 24 h. Cells were then grown in either
control medium or the same medium containing trastuzumab and incubated for another 72 h. After reading at
490 nm with a microplate reader, the percentages of surviving cells from each group relative to controls, defined as
100%, were determined by reduction of MTS.
Quantification of apoptosis. An apoptosis ELISA kit
(Roche Diagnostics) was used to quantitatively measure cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments as previously
reported (40).
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses of all experimental data were performed using a two-sided Student's t test.
Significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Coexpression of three RTKs—erbB2, erbB3, IGF-IR—and
their interactions in trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance, we focused on
the role of erbB3 and its relationship with IGF-IR in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. SKBR3 is a trastuzumabsensitive breast cancer cell line, and its resistant subline
SKBR3-pool2 (pool2) was developed through continuously
exposing SKBR3 cells to trastuzumab (24). BT474 is another
trastuzumab-sensitive cell line, and we have developed its resistant subline BT474-HR20 (HR20) through continuously
culturing BT474 cells by gradually increasing the concentrations of trastuzumab for 4 months. Both pool2 and HR20
cells are now maintained well in the presence of 20 μg/mL
trastuzumab. We first performed cell proliferation (MTS) assays and were able to confirm the resistant phenotype of
pool2 and HR20 cells (Fig. 1A). We then used Western blots
to generate the expression profile of RTKs and to examine
the downstream signaling in these breast cancer cells
(Fig. 1B). In general, the levels of erbB2, erbB3, and IGF-IR
were similar in all lines, although erbB3 was slightly higher
in pool2 than SKBR3 cells. The levels of P-Akt were dramatically increased in HR20 cells as compared with BT474 cells,
but P-MAPK levels remained the same. In contrast, P-MAPK
levels were considerably higher in pool2 as compared with
SKBR3 cells, and there was little increase in P-Akt levels. Interestingly, the levels of P-Src were significantly increased in
pool2 and HR20 cells as compared with their corresponding
control counterparts (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Src kinase activity was enhanced in the resistant cells. Thus, both trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer
cells exhibit coexpression of erbB2, erbB3, and IGF-IR. Hence,
multiple and distinct patterns of signaling pathway activation were observed in pool2 and HR20 cells.
Because the interaction between IGF-IR and erbB2 is the
major molecular mechanism resulting in trastuzumab resistance in pool2 cells (30), we wondered if the association of
these two receptors also exists in HR20 cells, and what is
the role of erbB3 in the cross-talk of IGF-IR and erbB2. To
answer these questions, immunoprecipitation with an anti–
IGF-IR antibody was carried out. A negative control immunoprecipitation with a rabbit IgG was also performed using the

1206

same lysates of pool2 and HR20 cells. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and followed by Western
blot analyses of erbB2, erbB3, or IGF-IR. A strong interaction
between IGF-IR and erbB2 was found in pool2 and HR20
cells, confirming previous studies (30). Importantly, our data
revealed, for the first time, a clear association between IGFIR and erbB3 only in pool2 and HR20 cells (Fig. 1C). Thus,
interactions between IGF-IR and erbB2 and between IGF-IR
and erbB3 were exclusively observed in trastuzumab-resistant cells. We next investigated the potential interactions
of erbB2 and erbB3 in the trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant cells. A similar coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed on the four cell lines. Weak but clear
associations of erbB2 and erbB3 were observed in SKBR3
and BT474 cells; interestingly, increased interactions between these two receptors were found in pool2 and HR20
cells (Fig. 1D). These data show that any two of the three
RTKs are able to exhibit strong interactions in trastuzumabresistant cells. To further confirm the results, immunofluorescent staining analyses were performed to examine the
colocalization of the receptors on single-cell level. After hybridization with specific primary antibody, one receptor
was labeled with Texas red (red)–conjugated secondary antibody, and another one was labeled with FITC (green)–
conjugated secondary antibody. In both SKBR3 and BT474
cells, the red and green colors were separately located. In
the resistant lines, however, the colors merged, giving a yellow
membranous signal (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that
any two of the three receptors colocalized in trastuzumabresistant cells.
erbB2, erbB3, and IGF-IR form heterotrimers in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. The aforementioned
data suggest two possibilities about the associations of the
three RTKs: (a) all three receptors may interact to form
one unique heterotrimer and (b) three heterodimers of
erbB2/erbB3, IGF-IR/erbB2, and erbB3/IGF-IR may coexist
in the trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. To distinguish these two possibilities, total cell lysates generated from
pool2 and HR20 cells were subjected to immunodepletion
with an anti–IGF-IR antibody. After binding with protein
A–agarose, the samples were centrifuged, and then the supernatant was further immunoprecipitated with an antierbB3 antibody and followed by Western blot analysis with
an anti-erbB2 antibody. For a control experiment, the total
cell lysates of pool2 and HR20 cells were directly immunoprecipitated with the anti-erbB3 antibody without immunodepletion and followed by Western blot analysis with the
anti-erbB2 antibody. A strong interaction between erbB3
and erbB2 was observed in both pool2 and HR20 cells
(Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6), which was consistent with our previous data (Fig. 1D). Importantly, after immunodepletion with
the anti–IGF-IR antibody, there was no erbB3-associated
erbB2 remaining in the supernatant, indicating that the
anti–IGF-IR antibody also depleted erbB3/erbB2 complexes,
although some free erbB3 protein might still remain in the supernatant (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that
the three RTKs exist within a multiprotein complex that is immunodepleted by the anti–IGF-IR antibody. These data also

argue against the existence of erbB2/erbB3, IGF-IR/erbB2, and
erbB3/IGF-IR heterodimers because erbB3 and erbB2 associations were no longer detectable after immunodepletion
with the anti–IGF-IR antibody (Fig. 2A). To the best of
our knowledge, this was the first study showing that the
three receptors participated in a multiprotein complex in
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells.
To provide direct evidence showing that the three RTKs
may form heterotrimers in trastuzumab-resistant cells, we
performed native PAGE, which would maintain the multiprotein complex intact. Western blot analyses with erbB2, erbB3,
or IGF-IR antibody following native PAGE revealed that a
major signal right below the 500 kDa marker was clearly observed in both pool2 and HR20 but not SKBR3 and BT474
cells (Fig. 2B–D). By calculation of their molecular weight,
a heterotrimer consisting of all three RTKs would be 460

kDa = 180 kDa (erbB3) + 185 kDa (erbB2) + 95 kDa (IGFIR). These data strongly indicated that the three RTKs actually formed heterotrimers in the resistant cells. In addition,
both erbB2 and erbB3 antibodies recognized the dimerization signals of the RTKs, 365 kDa = 180 kDa (erbB3) + 185
kDa (erbB2), mainly in SKBR3 and BT474 cells. The erbB2,
but not erbB3, antibody also recognized monomers in
SKBR3, BT474, and HR20 cells, suggesting that these cells
may produce more erbB2 than erbB3. Hence, some erbB2
molecules seem to exist as monomers, whereas the majority
of erbB3 molecules exist as either heterodimers (SKBR3 and
BT474 cells) or heterotrimers (pool2 and HR20 cells). The
strong monomer signals observed in BT474 and HR20 cells
with anti–IGF-IR antibody might be due to the higher IGFIR expression levels in these two cell lines than SKBR3 and
pool2 cells (Fig. 1B).

Disruption of heterotrimerization by specific knockdown
of either erbB3 or IGF-IR expression abrogates trastuzumab
resistance. To determine whether the heterotrimerization of
erbB3/erbB2/IGF-IR causally results in trastuzumab resistance, we investigated if specific knockdown of either erbB3
or IGF-IR would overcome the resistant phenotype. We
used vector-based shRNAs in a lentiviral system to ensure
specific and stable gene silencing. The erbB3 shRNA was
able to specifically and efficiently knock down erbB3 expression without affecting erbB2 or IGF-IR expressions.
Specific knockdown of erbB3 significantly decreased levels
of P-erbB3 and P-Akt in both pool2 and HR20 cells, produced a minor reduction of P-Src in pool2 cells, and did
not change levels of P-MAPK (Fig. 3A). There was no significant effect on erbB2/IGF-IR associations on knockdown of
erbB3 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that erbB2 was directly interacting with IGF-IR in the resistant cells. Although the combinations of erbB3 knockdown and trastuzumab did not
further decrease the levels of P-Akt and P-Src, they were
able to reduce P-erbB3 and P-MAPK and induce p27kip1 expression (Fig. 3C). More importantly, the resistant cells infected with the lentivirus containing erbB3 shRNA, but not
control shRNA, became significantly sensitive to trastuzumabmediated growth inhibition (Fig. 4D).
Similar results were obtained with IGF-IR. Specific knockdown of IGF-IR by the IGF-IR shRNAs had no effect on the

expression levels of erbB2 and erbB3 (Fig. 4A) and did not
alter the erbB2/erbB3 associations (Fig. 4B), suggesting a direct interaction between erbB2 and erbB3 in pool2 and HR20
cells. Knockdown of IGF-IR significantly resensitized the resistant cells to trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition
(Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the changes in the downstream signaling resulting from specific knockdown of IGF-IR were different from that of erbB3 knockdown. Knockdown of IGF-IR
resulted in a clear reduction in the levels of P-Src, a minor
decrease in P-MAPK, and no effect on P-erbB3 and P-Akt
(Fig. 4A); however, it dramatically enhanced trastuzumabmediated inhibitory effects on P-erbB3 and P-Akt (Fig. 4C).
The combinations of IGF-IR knockdown and trastuzumab induced upregulation of p27kip1 (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these data strongly show that disruption of the heterotrimerization of
the three RTKs via specific knockdown of either erbB3 or
IGF-IR abrogates trastuzumab resistance, and it is the heterotrimer of erbB3/erbB2/IGF-IR, not the heterodimers of
IGF-IR/erbB2 or erbB2/erbB3, that plays a critical role in
causing trastuzumab resistance.
Specific knockdown of erbB2 results in apoptosis of trastuzumab-resistant cells. To explore whether the activation
of downstream signaling pathways is dependent of erbB2
receptor, and to study if erbB3 is directly interacting with
IGF-IR in heterotrimer, we performed additional knockdown
experiments using two shRNA sequences. Knockdown of

separated by native PAGE and followed
by Western blots of erbB2 (B), erbB3 (C), or
IGF-IR (D). Strong signals just below the
500-kDa marker recognized by all three
antibodies indicate that the heterotrimer
complex existed only in the resistant cells. The
heterodimers or monomers of the receptors
were also observed.

erbB2 by the erbB2 shRNAs did not significantly affect the levels of erbB3, IGF-IR, P-Src, and P-MAPK (Fig. 5A), suggesting
that the erbB2 shRNAs were specific and efficient, and the activation of Src and MAPK kinases was independent of erbB2
action. Nonetheless, the levels of P-erbB2, P-erbB3, and P-Akt
were significantly reduced on erbB2 knockdown, and their

reduction rates were clearly correlated with the effectiveness
of shRNAs on downregulating erbB2 expression (Fig. 5A).
Moreover, specific knockdown of erbB2 promoted both

apoptosis was not observed in the cells with specific knockdown of either erbB3 or IGF-IR (data not shown). These results indicated that erbB2 RTK played an absolutely critical
role in activation of erbB3-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling to
maintain survival of the resistant cells. Similar to the results
obtained from the studies on erbB3 and IGF-IR, specific
knockdown of erbB2 expression did not affect the erbB3/

IGF-IR associations (Fig. 5B). Thus, any two of the three
RTKs exhibited direct interactions in both pool2 and HR20
cells. Whereas specific knockdown of IGF-IR expression
showed a major inhibitory effect on Src and MAPK signaling
(Fig. 4A), both erbB3 and erbB2 knockdown led to a significant impairment mainly on PI3K/Akt signaling (Figs. 3A
and 5A).

Discussion
Trastuzumab resistance currently represents a significant
clinical problem in breast cancer treatment. Elucidating the
molecular mechanisms underlying trastuzumab resistance is
critical to improve the survival of breast cancer patients
whose tumors overexpress erbB2. Several studies have revealed the importance of IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling, including
IGF-IR/erbB2 association, in causing trastuzumab resistance
(27, 29, 30); however, the role of erbB3 in the cross-talk of
IGF-IR and erbB2 remains unknown. Our current studies indicate that erbB3 plays as an important role as IGF-IR, and
both erbB3 and IGF-IR work cooperatively with erbB2 in
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. Although dimerization between erbB2 and another RTK, such as erbB3,
EGFR, or IGF-IR, has been the focus of many research labo-

ratories in exploring the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance, here we provide compelling evidence to support a
novel hypothesis—heterotrimer formation of erbB3/erbB2/
IGF-IR leads to trastuzumab resistance. Our data indicate
that any two of these three RTKs interact directly and lead
to activation of unique downstream signaling pathways in
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells (Fig. 6). Although
specific knockdown of any one of the three receptors does
not interfere with the associations of the remaining two, each
receptor exhibits distinct roles in maintaining activation of
the multiple signaling pathways. Knockdown of erbB3 has
no effect on P-MAPK but induces a dramatic decrease of
P-Akt and a minor reduction in P-Src (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
knockdown of IGF-IR reduces the levels of P-Src and PMAPK but not P-Akt; however, it does render the cells to
trastuzumab-mediated inactivation of Akt (Fig. 4A and C).

These data are consistent with previous reports that PI3K/
Akt signaling plays an important role in trastuzumab resistance (7, 20, 21). Another potential molecular mechanism of
trastuzumab resistance may be due to changes of erbB2 conformation on heterotrimerization with erbB3 and IGF-IR,
which hinder trastuzumab binding. As depicted in Fig. 6,
on knockdown of either erbB3 or IGF-IR, the conformation
of erbB2 in monomers or heterodimers (erbB2/IGF-IR or
erbB2/erbB3) may render trastuzumab binding effectively,
and subsequently attenuates the downstream signaling and
upregulates the CDK inhibitor p27kip1. It will be very interest-

ing to determine if the conformation of erbB2 differs in heterotrimers and heterodimers and if distinct domains mediate
erbB2 interactions in the heterotrimerization and heterodimerization of the RTKs.
Interestingly, a recent report reveals that another erbB2
splice variant, erbB2Δ16, which was detected in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (38, 43, 44), promotes trastuzumab resistance via direct coupling with Src tyrosine kinase
(45). We have found that specific knockdown of either erbB3
or IGF-IR reduces the levels of P-Src and resensitizes the resistant cells to trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition in

Figure 6. Proposed model of erbB3/erbB2/IGF-IR
heterotrimerization resulting in trastuzumab
resistance. Our studies show that any two of the
three receptors directly interact with each other to
form a heterotrimer complex, which may
prevent/inhibit trastuzumab binding effectively to
erbB2 (1) and activate the unique downstream
signaling (2). Disruption of the heterotrimerization
by specific knockdown of either erbB3 or
IGF-IR not only enhances the binding efficiency of
trastuzumab due to erbB2 receptor conformation
changes but also inhibits kinase activities of
Src, Akt, or MAPK and therefore abrogates
trastuzumab resistance via inactivation of the
downstream signaling pathways and upregulation
of p27kip1.

erbB3/erbB2/IGF-IR Heterotrimer in Herceptin Resistance

both pool2 and HR20 cells. Because of the importance of
PI3K/Akt signaling and Src in trastuzumab resistance, we
sought to define the role of Akt and Src activation in erbB3/
erbB2/IGF-IR heterotrimer-mediated trastuzumab resistance.
Specific inhibitors were used to explore whether inhibition of
Akt or Src may reverse the resistant phenotype in pool2 and
HR20 cells. P-Src was significantly reduced on dasatinib treatment in both pool2 and HR20 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 alone inhibited Akt activation
only in HR20 cells; however, the combinations of LY294002
and trastuzumab dramatically decreased the P-Akt levels
in both pool2 and HR20 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Importantly, both dasatinib and LY294002 were able to significantly enhance trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). These data suggest that activation
of both PI3K/Akt signaling and Src contributes to erbB3/
erbB2/IGF-IR heterotrimer-mediated trastuzumab resistance
in pool2 and HR20 cells.
It is not clear, at this moment, how the three RTKs form
heterotrimers in the resistant cells. It has been reported that
the ligands for erbB3 and IGF-IR, secreted (soluble) heregulin
and IGF-I, attenuate the inhibitory effect of trastuzumab in
erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (14, 29). Moreover,
in vivo selected trastuzumab-resistant lines from BT474 xenograft tumors overexpress EGFR and multiple erbB ligands,
including heregulin (15). A recent article show that activation
of erbB3 signaling by ADAM17, which is the major sheddase
for heregulin (46), is required for transforming growth factor
β–induced trastuzumab resistance in erbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells (47). If we can confirm the hypothesis that
both IGF-I (or IGF-II) and heregulin may be upregulated in
pool2 and HR20 cells by the long-term selection of trastuzumab, then approaches to block ligands binding to their
corresponding receptors may be novel strategies to overcome the resistant phenotype in breast cancer cells.
We believe this is the first report showing a heterotrimerization of erbB3/erbB2/IGF-IR in trastuzumab-resistant

breast cancer cells, which can activate multiple downstream
signaling pathways resulting in trastuzumab resistance. The
data we show have significant clinical implications. Nonetheless, the confirmation of our hypothesis with clinical samples
is urgently needed. We are collaborating with physician scientist to determine whether these three receptors can also form
a heterotrimer complex in tumor tissues obtained from those
breast cancer patients who fail from trastuzumab-based therapy. Our studies may change the view of cancer biologists
about the protein-protein interactions among the three RTKs.
erbB2, erbB3, and IGF-IR can form not only heterodimers but
also heterotrimers in trastuzumab-resistant cells, suggesting
that novel approaches simultaneously targeting these three receptors may ultimately benefit breast cancer patients whose
tumors overexpress erbB2. For a subset of trastuzumabresistant patients, anti-erbB3 and anti–IGF-IR blocking antibodies may work synergistically to overcome trastuzumab
resistance and enhance its therapeutic efficacy.
