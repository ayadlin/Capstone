Abstract
The Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1) transcription factor has been
shown to play important roles in regulating the expression of
genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and
transformation. Overexpression of FoxM1 has been found in
a variety of aggressive human carcinomas including pancreatic cancer. However, the precise role and the molecular
mechanism of action of FoxM1 in pancreatic cancer remain
unclear. To elucidate the cellular and molecular function of
FoxM1, we tested the consequences of down-regulation and
up-regulation of FoxM1 in pancreatic cancer cells, respectively.
Using multiple cellular and molecular approaches such as
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay, gene transfection, flow cytometry, real-time reverse
transcription-PCR, Western blotting, migration, invasion, and
angiogenesis assays, we found that down-regulation of FoxM1
inhibited cell growth, decreased cell migration, and decreased
invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. FoxM1 down-regulation
also decreased cell population in the S phase. Compared with
control, FoxM1 small interfering RNA–transfected cells
showed decreased expression of cyclin B, cyclin D1, and
Cdk2, whereas p21 and p27 expression was increased. We also
found that down-regulation of FoxM1 reduced the expression
of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and vascular
endothelial growth factor, resulting in the inhibition of
migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. These findings suggest
that FoxM1 down-regulation could be a novel approach for
the inhibition of pancreatic tumor progression. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers and
is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United
States, with about 32,000 newly diagnosed cases and an
approximately equal number of deaths per year (1). This could
be due to the fact that no effective methods of early diagnosis are
currently available, as well as due to the lack of effective systemic
therapies resulting in the high mortality of patients diagnosed with
PC. This disappointing outcome strongly suggests that there is a
dire need for innovative research that will lead to a dramatic
improvement in the survival of patients diagnosed with this deadly
disease.

FoxM1 signaling is involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis,
which affects the development and function of many organs (2–4).
FoxM1 (previously known as HFH-11, MPP2, Win, and Trident) is a
member of the Fox transcription factor family (2–6). It has been
reported that FoxM1 is a key cell cycle regulator of both the
transition from G1 to S phase and the progression to mitosis (2, 3,
7–10). Loss of FoxM1 expression generates mitotic spindle defects,
delays cells in mitosis, and induces mitotic catastrophe (9).
Moreover, FoxM1 has been shown to regulate transcription of cell
cycle genes essential for G1-S and G2-M progression, including
Cdc25A, Cdc25B, cyclin B, cyclin D1, p21cip1, and p27kip1 (2, 7, 10–12).
FoxM1 signaling also plays important roles in the cellular
developmental pathway including proliferation and apoptosis, and
alterations in FoxM1 signaling are associated with tumorigenesis
(5, 6, 13). These observations suggest that dysfunction of FoxM1
prevents differentiation, ultimately guiding undifferentiated cells
toward malignant transformation. It has also been reported that
the FoxM1 signaling network is frequently deregulated in human
malignancies with up-regulated expression of FoxM1 in lung
cancer, glioblastomas, prostate cancer, basal cell carcinomas,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and primary breast cancer and PC
(2, 5, 6, 9, 13–15). These results suggest that FoxM1 plays important
roles in the oncogenesis of several malignancies. Recent data
suggest that the FoxM1 gene is up-regulated in PC due to
transcriptional regulation by the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (2).
There has been some progress toward elucidating the mechanism
of action of FoxM1 as well as the consequence of down-regulation
of FoxM1; however, the exact mechanism has not yet been fully
established. Therefore, we sought to find novel avenues by which
FoxM1 could be inactivated, which may represent a promising
strategy for the development of novel and selective anticancer
therapies for PC. We investigated the consequence of downregulation of FoxM1 by FoxM1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) on
PC cell growth and apoptosis. Moreover, because cell migration
and invasion are important processes involved in tumor development and metastasis and because FoxM1 signaling is known to
control these processes, we also examined the effect of FoxM1 on
the processes of cell migration and invasion of PC cells. We found
that down-regulation of FoxM1 inhibits cell growth of PC cell lines.
Our data also show that down-regulation of FoxM1 inhibited the
expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which could be the
mechanism responsible for the inhibition of PC cell migration,
invasion, and the activity of conditioned media to inhibit
angiogenesis as measured by tube formation of human umbilical
vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC).

detection of proteins was done with the use of a kit from Amersham
Biosciences (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protease inhibitor cocktail,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and all
other chemicals were obtained from Sigma.

separate experiments having six determinations per experiment for each
experimental condition.
Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis. The transfected cells were
trypsinized, collected, and washed twice with PBS. Cell pellets were fixed in
70% ethanol and stored at 4jC. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and
the pellets were resuspended in 0.05 mg/mL of propidium iodide containing
0.6% Nonidet P-40 for the analysis. RNase (0.02 mg/mL) was added, and the

suspension was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The
cell suspension was then filtered and analyzed for DNA content on a
FACScan (BDIS) flow cytometer. The percent of cells in different phases of
the cell cycle was analyzed with CELLQUest software (BDIS) using a Power
Macintosh 7500/100 computer (Apple Computer).
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris (pH, 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% Triton
X-100, 2.5 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 10 AL/mL protease inhibitor
cocktail, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)] by incubating for 20 min at 4jC. The protein concentration was determined using
the Bio-Rad assay system. Total proteins were fractionated using SDS-PAGE

(5¶-AGGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTCAG-3¶). Real-time PCR amplifications were done as described earlier (18).
MMP-2 assay. The culture medium of the FoxM1 siRNA- or control
siRNA-transfected cells grown in six-well plates was collected. After
collection, the medium was spun at 800  g for 3 min at 4jC to remove
cell debris. The supernatant was either frozen at 20jC for later MMP-2
assay or assayed immediately using commercially available ELISA kits (R&D
Systems, Inc.).
MMP-9 activity assay. The FoxM1 siRNA- or cDNA-transfected cells were
seeded in six-well plates and incubated at 37jC. After 24 h, the complete
medium was removed, and the cells were washed with serum-free medium.
The cells were then incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. MMP-9 activity
in the medium was detected by using Fluorokine E Human MMP-9 activity
assay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
VEGF assay. The FoxM1 siRNA- or cDNA-transfected cells were seeded
in six-well plates (1.0  105 cells per well) and incubated at 37jC. After 24 h,
the cell culture supernatant was harvested, and cell count was done after
trypsinization. After collection, the medium was spun at 800  g for 3 min
at 4jC to remove cell debris. The supernatant was either frozen at 20jC
for later VEGF assay or assayed immediately using commercially available
ELISA kits (R&D Systems).
Cell migration and invasion assay. Cell migration was assessed using
24-well inserts (BD Biosciences) with 8-Am pores according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The invasive activity of the FoxM1 or control
siRNA-transfected cells was tested using the BD BioCoat Tumor Invasion
Assay System (BD Biosciences). Briefly, transfected PC cells (5  104) with
serum-free medium were seeded into the upper chamber of the system.
Bottom wells in the system were filled with complete medium. After 24 h of
incubation, the cells in the upper chamber were removed, and the cells that
had invaded through Matrigel matrix membrane were stained with 4 Ag/mL
calcein AM in Hanks’ buffered saline at 37jC for 1 h. The fluorescence of the
invaded cells was read in ULTRA Multifunctional Microplate Reader
(TECAN) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/590 nm. These

fluorescently labeled invasive cells were also photographed under a
fluorescent microscope.
Matrigel in vitro HUVECs tube formation assay. The FoxM1 siRNA- or
cDNA-transfected cells were cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 24 h. The
conditioned media were collected, centrifuged, and transferred to fresh
tubes and stored at 20jC. Growth factor–reduced Matrigel (125 AL), after
being thawed on ice, was plated in an eight-well chamber. The chamber was
then incubated at 37jC for 30 min to allow the Matrigel to polymerize.
HUVECs were trypsinized and seeded (5  104 cells per well) in each well
with 250 AL of conditioned medium from FoxM1 siRNA or control siRNAtransfected BxPC-3 or HPAC cells. The chamber was incubated for 6 h. Each
well was photographed using an inverted microscope with digital camera.
The assessment of vessel number and length of vessel perimeter in each of
the entire field was calculated using the Scion Image analysis program.1
Densitometric and statistical analysis. The cell growth inhibition after
transfection was statistically evaluated using GraphPad StatMate software
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). Comparisons were made between control and
transfection. P < 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.

Results
Down-regulation of FoxM1 expression by siRNA inhibited
cell growth. The baseline expression of FoxM1 was determined in a
panel of human PC cell lines that included AsPC-1, BxPC-3, COLO357, HPAC, L3.6pl, MIAPaCa, and PANC-1. The results showed that
FoxM1 was frequently but differentially expressed in different
human PC cell lines (Fig. 1A). We also examined the relative mRNA
levels of FoxM1 in three PC cell lines such as BxPC-3, HPAC, and
PANC-1 by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). All three

cell lines expressed high levels of FoxM1 in both mRNA and protein
level (Fig. 1A and B). To determine whether FoxM1 could be an
effective therapeutic target for PC, the effect of FoxM1 siRNA on cell
growth of the PC cells was examined. The efficacy of FoxM1 siRNA
for knockdown of FoxM1 mRNA and protein was confirmed by realtime RT-PCR and Western blotting. We observed that both FoxM1
mRNA and protein levels were barely detectable in FoxM1 siRNAtransfected cells compared with siRNA control-transfected cells
(Fig. 1C and D). The cell viability was determined by MTT, and the
effect of FoxM1 siRNA on the growth of cancer cells is shown in
Fig. 2. We found that the down-regulation of FoxM1 expression
caused cell growth inhibition in all three PC cell lines.
Overexpression of FoxM1 by cDNA transfection promoted
cell growth. PC cells AsPC-1, PANC-1, and Colo-357 were
transfected with human FoxM1 or empty vector alone. The reason
for choosing these three PC cell lines was due to the fact that these
cell lines showed the lowest expression of FoxM1. The proteins
were measured using Western blotting. The results showed that
FoxM1 protein level was increased by FoxM1 cDNA transfection
(Fig. 1D). FoxM1 cDNA-transfected cells showed a significant
promotion of cell growth compared with empty vector–transfected
control cells (Fig. 2).
Down-regulation of FoxM1 decreased cell population in the
S phase. To further investigate the growth-inhibitory effect of
FoxM1 knockdown in PC cells, we did cell cycle analysis by
propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Depletion of FoxM1
levels in BxPC-3, HPAC, and PANC-1 cells caused a significant
accumulation of cells in the G0-G1 phase and a marked decrease in
the S phase compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3).
However, as shown in Fig. 3, the percentage of FoxM1 cDNAtransfected cells in the S phase was increased compared with that
of control vector–transfected cells.
To further characterize the G0-G1 arrest, we examined the level
of expression of several known G0-G1 cell cycle regulatory factors.
Consistent with cell cycle arrest, the expression of cyclin D1 and

Cdk2 at both the mRNA and protein levels was found to be
decreased, whereas p21 and p27 expression was increased (Fig. 4),
suggesting the mechanistic roles of these molecules during FoxM1induced cell cycle progression and cell cycle arrest by FoxM1
siRNA. To confirm our data, we also found that the expression of
FoxM1 target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, such
as E2F-1, survivin, cyclin B, and cdc25A, was down-regulated in
FoxM1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4).
Down-regulation of FoxM1 decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9
gene transcription and their activities. It has been reported that
MMP-9 expression is elevated in the liver of FoxM1B transgenic
mice (19). We therefore investigated whether MMP-9 and MMP-2
were down-regulated by FoxM1 siRNA in PC cell lines. To explore
whether FoxM1 siRNA transfection could decrease the expression
of MMP-2 and MMP-9, real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting
were conducted. We found that both MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA
and protein levels were dramatically decreased in the FoxM1
siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5A and B). Next, we examined whether
the down-regulation of FoxM1 could lead to a decrease in MMP-2
and MMP-9 activity in PC cells. There was a marked decrease in the
activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in FoxM1 siRNA-transfected cells
(Fig. 5C and D). However, overexpression of FoxM1 by cDNA
transfection led to an increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression
and activity in Colo-357 and PANC-1 cells (data not shown).
FoxM1 siRNA decreased VEGF activity. FoxM1 has been
shown to regulate VEGF signaling in various cell types (20). To
further explore whether FoxM1 siRNA reduced VEGF activity, we
examined the levels of VEGF activity secreted in the culture
medium. We found that FoxM1 could lead to a decrease in the
levels of VEGF secreted in the culture medium (Fig. 5E). However,
there was a marked increase in the activity of VEGF in FoxM1
cDNA-transfected Colo-357 and PANC-1 cells (data not shown).
FoxM1 siRNA reduced uPAR gene transcription and translation. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and uPA
receptor (uPAR) are able to regulate the MMP-9 activity in PC (21).

Down-regulation of FoxM1 Inhibits Invasion and Angiogenesis

Figure 4. The expression level of several known G0-G1 cell cycle regulatory factors as detected by real-time RT-PCR (A and B ) and Western blotting (C ) in all three PC
cells, respectively. The experiments were repeated thrice. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, relative to control.

To further investigate whether FoxM1 siRNA has any effect on
reducing the level of uPAR, real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting
were done to detect the expression of uPAR. We found that both
uPAR mRNA and protein levels were dramatically reduced in
FoxM1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5A and B).
Down-regulation of FoxM1 decreased PC cell migration and
invasion. MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF, and uPAR are thought to be
critically involved in the processes of tumor cell migration,
invasion, and metastasis. Because FoxM1 siRNA inhibited the
expression and activity of MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF, and uPAR, we
tested the effects of FoxM1 down-regulation on cancer cell
migration and invasion. We found that down-regulation of FoxM1
decreased PC cell migration. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 6B,
FoxM1 siRNA-transfected cells showed a low level of penetration
through the Matrigel-coated membrane compared with the control
cells. The value of fluorescence from the invaded PC cells was
decreased about 3- to 4-fold compared with that of control cells
(Fig. 6B). However, FoxM1 cDNA-transfected Colo-357 cells showed
a marked increase in cell migration and invasion (data not shown).
Reduced tube formation of HUVECs induced by conditioned
media from FoxM1 siRNA-transfected cells. Inhibition of FoxM1
reduced tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis in hepatocellular
carcinomas (22). FoxM1 has been reported to promote both
angiogenesis and metastasis in certain tumor models (22). Because
FoxM1 siRNA inhibited VEGF expression, we tested whether
conditioned media from FoxM1 siRNA-transfected cells could
reduce the tube formation, an indirect measure of angiogenesis. We
did the tube formation assay in growth factor–reduced Matrigel
in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6C, conditioned media from FoxM1

www.aacrjournals.org

siRNA-transfected BxPC-3 and HPAC cells were able to significantly
reduce the tube formation of HUVECs in 6 h incubation compared
with the medium from control siRNA-transfected cells. However,
conditioned media from FoxM1 cDNA-transfected Colo-357
and PANC-1 cells increased the tube formation of HUVECs in
6 h incubation compared with the medium from control cDNAtransfected cells (data not shown).

Discussion
FoxM1 signaling plays important roles in maintaining the
balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis
(2, 5–7). The FoxM1 gene is abnormally activated in many human
malignancies (5–7, 9, 15). It was found that FoxM1 gene is upregulated in PC due to the transcriptional regulation by the Sonic
Hedgehog pathway (2). We have previously reported that docetaxel
(taxotere) alone or in combination with estramustine downregulated the expression of FoxM1 in prostate cancer leading to
cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis (23, 24). We also
found that 3,3¶-diindolylmethane (DIM) reduced the expression of
FoxM1 in breast cancer cells (25). However, very little or no
information is available regarding the consequence of FoxM1
down-regulation in PC. Thus, in the present study, we investigated
the role of FoxM1 in cell proliferation in PC cell lines. In our study,
down-regulation of FoxM1 elicited a dramatic effect on growth
inhibition of PC cells as shown by MTT assay. Our results provide
in vitro evidence in support of the role of FoxM1 as an oncogene in
PC cells because FoxM1 is known to induce oncogenesis, and its
down-regulation causes inhibition of cell growth.

Cancer Research

Because down-regulation of FoxM1 by siRNA reduced cell
growth, we postulated whether cell growth inhibition was due to
cell cycle arrest in any specific phase of the cell cycle. Indeed, we
found that FoxM1 down-regulation increased cell population in
the G0-G1 phase and decreased cell progression into the DNA
replication phase (S phase). Diminished G1-S progression and
growth rate was associated with increased expression of the CdkI
protein p21CIP and p27KIP1, which is known to have negative effects
on cell cycle machinery by binding to various cyclin-Cdk complexes
and inhibiting their activities (26–29). We also observed a marked
reduction in cyclin B, cyclin D1, and Cdk2 expression in FoxM1
siRNA-transfected cells. In our study, the decrease in cyclin D1,
cyclin B, and Cdk2 and the increased expression of CdkI proteins,
including p21CIP and p27KIP1, were strongly correlated with the
altered cell cycle distribution phenotype and growth suppression.
These results suggest that FoxM1 affects the PC cell cycle by
regulating the expression levels of some cyclins (cyclin D1 and
cyclin B) and CDK inhibitors (p21CIP and p27KIP1).
Because FoxM1 has been reported to promote both angiogenesis
and metastasis in certain tumor models and inhibition of FoxM1
reduced tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis in hepatocellular
carcinomas (22), MMP-9 expression was also elevated in the liver of
FoxM1B transgenic mice (19). It is known that MMPs are critically
involved in the processes of tumor cell invasion and metastasis,
and that MMP-9 and MMP-2 are directly associated with angiogenesis and metastatic processes (30–33). Both MMP-9 and MMP-2
have been implicated in metastasis because of their role in the
degradation of the basement membrane collagen (30). Here, we
showed that the down-regulation of FoxM1 inhibited MMP-9 and

MMP-2 expression. We also found that the down-regulation of
FoxM1 inhibited the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the culture
medium of PC cells. However, overexpression of FoxM1 increased
the expression and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Thus, these
results suggest that the down-regulation of FoxM1 could potentiate
antitumor and antimetastatic activities, partly through the downregulation of the expression of MMPs.
Another important molecule involved in tumor cell invasion and
metastasis is VEGF. Many studies have documented that VEGF is a
critical mediator of angiogenesis and regulates most of the steps in
the angiogenic cascade, including proliferation, migration, and
tube formation of endothelial cells (34). Investigations by other
laboratories have shown that VEGF promotes migration and
invasion of PC cells (35). The results of these investigations also
suggested a trend toward an association between the expression of
VEGF and distant metastasis (35, 36). It has been reported that
FoxM1 regulates VEGF signaling in various cell types (20). In this
study, we found a significant reduction of VEGF secretion in the
culture medium of PC cells by FoxM1 down-regulation. We also
found a marked increase in the activity of VEGF in FoxM1 cDNAtransfected cells. There are several other genes that also play
important roles in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. It is well
accepted that uPA and its receptor (uPAR) are important genes in
the processes of tumor cell invasion and metastasis (37). uPA
systems, including uPA and uPAR, play important roles in many
aspects of the angiogenic process, including extracellular cascade
of proteolysis, basement membrane degradation, cell migration,
and invasion. It has been reported that cancer cells with higher
levels of uPA or uPAR will tend to invade surrounding tissues and

Figure 5. A and B, real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that FoxM1 siRNA inhibited the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPAR genes at mRNA
and protein levels in PC cells. C, FoxM1 siRNA inhibited the activity of MMP-2 in PC cells. D, FoxM1 siRNA inhibited the activity of MMP-9 in BxPC-3 PC cells.
E, FoxM1 siRNA inhibited the activity of VEGF in PC cells. The experiments were repeated thrice. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, relative to control.

Down-regulation of FoxM1 Inhibits Invasion and Angiogenesis

Figure 6. FoxM1 siRNA decreased PC cell migration and invasion and reduced the HUVECs tube formation. The experiments were repeated thrice. *, P < 0.05 relative
to control. A, top, migration assay showing that FoxM1 siRNA decreased PC cell migration. Bottom, value of fluorescence from the migrated cells. B, top, invasion
assay showing that FoxM1 siRNA-transfected cells resulted in low penetration through the Matrigel-coated membrane, compared with control cells. Bottom, value
of fluorescence from the invaded cells. The value indicated the comparative amount of invaded cells. C, top, Conditioned media from FoxM1 siRNA-transfected BxPC-3
and HPAC cells were able to significantly reduce the tube formation of HUVECs in 6 h incubation compared with the medium from control. Bottom, image analysis

subsequently migrate to blood vessels, thereby developing cancer
cell metastasis (38). Indeed, in the present study, we found that the
down-regulation of FoxM1 inhibited the expression of uPAR. Our
results suggest that the down-regulation of FoxM1 could potentiate
the antimetastasis activities partly through the down-regulation of
VEGF and uPAR expression.
Because we observed that the down-regulation of FoxM1
inhibited the expression and activities of MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF,
and uPAR, we tested the effects of the down-regulation of FoxM1
on the migration and invasion of PC cells and tube formation
(angiogenesis) of HUVECs. We found that the down-regulation of
FoxM1 inhibited migration and invasion of PC cells through the
Matrigel and reduced the tube formation of HUVECs. These results
are consistent with the inactivation of MMP-9, MMP-2, VEGF, and
uPAR by the down-regulation of FoxM1, resulting in the inhibition
of cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis. We also found that the
down-regulation of FoxM1 inhibited the activity of NF-nB (data not
shown), documenting that the down-regulation of FoxM1 could
inhibit cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis partly through the
down-regulation of NF-nB and its target genes MMP-9 and VEGF.

However, further in-depth studies are needed to ascertain the
precise molecular regulation of FoxM1 and NF-nB and their crosstalks in elucidating the role of FoxM1 in cell growth, invasion, and
angiogenesis of PC cells in animal models and in human PC.
In summary, we presented experimental evidence that strongly
supports the role of FoxM1 down-regulation as antitumor and antimetastatic mechanisms in PC. The down-regulation of FoxM1 induced G0-G1 phase cell cycle arrest with reduced levels of cyclin D1
expression and increased p21CIP and p27KIP1 expression. From these
results, we conclude that the down-regulation of FoxM1 could
potentially be an effective therapeutic approach for the inactivation
MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF, which is likely to result in the inhibition of
cell growth, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of PC.
