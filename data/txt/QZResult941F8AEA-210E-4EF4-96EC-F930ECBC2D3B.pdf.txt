Targeting the eIF4F Translation Initiation
Complex: A Critical Nexus for Cancer
Development

Abstract
Elevated protein synthesis is an important feature of many
cancer cells and often arises as a consequence of increased signaling ﬂux channeled to eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F),
the key regulator of the mRNA–ribosome recruitment phase of
translation initiation. In many cellular and preclinical models of
cancer, eIF4F deregulation results in changes in translational
efﬁciency of speciﬁc mRNA classes. Importantly, many of these
mRNAs code for proteins that potently regulate critical cellular
processes, such as cell growth and proliferation, enhanced cell
survival and cell migration that ultimately impinge on several
hallmarks of cancer, including increased angiogenesis, deregu-

The Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4F
Complex
There have been tomes written on the subject of translational
control under normal and pathophysiologic conditions (1). In
this review, we focus on the role that the "cap-binding complex,"
eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), plays in mRNA discrimination and in driving tumorigenesis. We also discuss strategies
aimed at therapeutically inhibiting eIF4F activity.
A salient hallmark of eukaryotic cytoplasmic, nonorganellar,
mRNAs is the 50 terminal cap, a structure added to nascent mRNA
templates shortly after initiation of transcription. Although the
cap has been implicated in several nuclear events (splicing, polyadenylation, and nuclear/cytoplasmic transport) and plays a
protective role against 50 exonucleolytic degradation, its best
documented function is in facilitating the recruitment of 43S
preinitiation complexes to mRNA templates (2). Initial pioneering studies elucidating a role for the cap in translation uncovered
an important conceptual point—in vitro its presence is facilitative
in nature but in vivo it is absolutely essential (3).

lated growth control, enhanced cellular survival, epithelial-tomesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis. By being positioned as the molecular nexus downstream of key oncogenic
signaling pathways (e.g., Ras, PI3K/AKT/TOR, and MYC), eIF4F
serves as a direct link between important steps in cancer development and translation initiation. Identiﬁcation of mRNAs particularly responsive to elevated eIF4F activity that typiﬁes tumorigenesis underscores the critical role of eIF4F in cancer and raises
the exciting possibility of developing new-in-class small molecules targeting translation initiation as antineoplastic agents.

A second important ﬁnding that emerged from these early
experiments was the existence of an inverse relationship
between secondary structure within the 50 untranslated region
(UTR) of mRNAs and translational efﬁciency. This link was
deduced from experiments reporting on the translational efﬁciency of mRNAs with differing secondary structure, on the ATP
requirement of initiation factors involved in cap recognition,
and the varying degree of inhibition by cap analogues
on initiation of mRNAs with differing secondary structure
(4–9). An understanding of the basis of this relationship was
afforded when the cytoplasmic mammalian cap-binding protein eIF4E was identiﬁed and puriﬁed (10) and shown capable
of stimulating translation of capped mRNA in HeLa cell extracts
(11). eIF4E was subsequently found to be a component of the
heterotrimeric eIF4F complex that also contains a large approximately 220-kDa scaffolding protein (eIF4G) and the ATPdependent RNA helicase, eIF4A (12).

A Molecular Commitment—Recruiting the
Ribosome to the mRNA
Cap-dependent ribosome recruitment
eIF4E is the least abundant of the initiation factors, present at
0.2 to 0.3 molecules per ribosome in reticulocytes and HeLa cells,
rendering it rate-limiting for translation (13, 14). However,
whether eIF4E levels are limiting at the organismal level across
all cell types and cancer cells in vivo remains an outstanding
question. In contrast to eIF4E, eIF4A is the most abundant
initiation factor—present at approximately 3 to 6 molecules per
ribosome and is solely cytoplasmic (13, 14). In mammals, there
exist two highly related eIF4A homologs, eIF4AI (DDX2A) and
eIF4AII (DDX2B; the human proteins are 90% identical; refs. 15,
16), with eIF4AI generally being the more abundantly expressed
(14, 17). The majority (90%) of eIF4A exists as a free form

(eIF4Af) while a small proportion is present as an eIF4F subunit
(eIF4Ac; refs. 18–20). There are also two homologs of eIF4G,
eIF4GI and eIF4GII, which share 46% identity, with eIF4GI being
more abundant (21). eIF4G interacts with eIF4E and eIF4A
through deﬁned domains and provides the scaffold upon which
other factors important for the initiation process assemble (22). In
mammals, there are two separate eIF4A interacting domains on
eIF4G, and it is generally thought that the two domains interact
with different regions of the same eIF4A molecule (23). Given that
eIF4AI and eIF4AII are interchangeable in the eIF4F complex (16),
it would appear that mammalian cells can generate four different
eIF4F complexes, the functional consequences of which remain
unknown.
Although the involvement of eIF4B and eIF4H in translation
initiation is well established, their precise roles need to be better
characterized. eIF4B and eIF4H are RNA-binding proteins that

www.aacrjournals.org

stimulate eIF4A helicase activity, enabling eIF4A to unwind more
stable duplexes (24–27). Their interaction with eIF4A is mutually
exclusive, as the two proteins share a common binding site (28).
eIF4B and eIF4H modulate the afﬁnity of eIF4A for ATP or ADP
(29, 30) and RNA (31) with the interaction of eIF4B near the 50 cap
structure being ATP (and presumably eIF4A)-dependent (6), and
inhibited by secondary structure (7). Through their RNA-recognition motifs, eIF4B and eIF4H may also stabilize single-stranded
regions in the 50 -UTR to prevent re-annealing following unwinding by eIF4A (Fig. 1). eIF4B is obligatory for 48S initiation
complex formation on mRNAs possessing even modest levels of
50 -UTR complexity (32) and its depletion results in reduced
proliferation rates, cell survival, and enhanced sensitivity to
camptothecin-induced cell death (33). These results implicate
eIF4B function in controlling the translation of mRNAs critical for
cell proliferation and survival.

mRNA discrimination
eIF4F is the long-sought discriminatory factor responsible for
differences in translation rates among many mRNAs. Two criteria
are required for this to hold true—ﬁrst, eIF4F had to be limiting
(see above) and different mRNAs had to exhibit distinct afﬁnities
(or requirements) for recruitment of eIF4F—a feature that was
linked to the degree of mRNA 50 -UTR secondary structure (34, 35).
Consistent with eIF4F discriminating between different mRNAs
based on secondary structure, initiation on simple, unstructured
model mRNAs (containing [CAA]n as 50 -UTR) does not require
eIF4F, the cap, or ATP (36). As well, a dominant-negative mutant
of eIF4A capable of inhibiting eIF4F activity exhibits less potent
inhibition toward translation of mRNAs with a lower degree of
secondary structure compared with transcripts harboring more
structure (37).
How the location of secondary structure within the 50 -UTR
determines whether a particular transcript will be a "weak" or
"strong" competitor is not well deﬁned, but the net consequences
may reﬂect the accumulated effects on various steps of the
ribosome recruitment process. Binding of eIF4E to the cap structure is the ﬁrst step in loading of the 43S preinitiation complex
onto the mRNA—an interaction mediated by base stacking of the
positively charged N-7 methylguanosine between two tryptophans (W56 and W102) and auxiliary interactions (38–40). Three
RNA-binding sites on eIF4G, necessary for efﬁcient translation
initiation, stabilize this interaction (Fig. 1; refs. 41–43). Structure
proximal to the cap (secondary structure or protein–mRNA interactions) can inﬂuence the interaction between eIF4E and mRNA
in a negative manner (44–48). On the other hand, structure
located distal from the cap exerts little effect on eIF4E–cap
interaction but can interfere with eIF4F-mediated unwinding—
inhibiting the interaction of eIF4A and/or eIF4B with mRNA
(7, 49). Because eIF4Af has a bidirectional helicase activity, its
delivery to the 50 -end of the mRNA provides forced directionality
to this enzyme. Although eIF4Af has weak helicase in vitro (24, 50),
its presence in the eIF4F complex leads to an approximately 20fold increase in helicase activity (24, 51, 52). This has been
attributed to eIF4E because its binding to eIF4G masks an eIF4A
autoinhibitory domain on eIF4G (53). Hence, eIF4E is capable of
promoting the helicase activity of eIF4A and increasing translation
rates by a mechanism distinct from its cap-binding function. The
overabundance of eIF4A relative to eIF4E (13, 54), the elevated
helicase activity of eIF4Ac relative to eIF4Af (24, 51, 52), and the
ability of eIF4Af to exchange with eIF4Ac (16) has led to the
proposal that eIF4A recycles through the eIF4F complex during
initiation (Fig. 1; ref. 55). The idea that eIF4A/eIF4B/eIF4H may
polymerize on the mRNA is consistent with the observed capdependent cross-linking of these factors downstream of the cap
(56). As noted by Kapp and Lorsch (22), such a polymerization
model is also consistent with the kinetics of unwinding at low
concentrations of eIF4A where a lag in activity is often observed.
One additional interaction that affects translation initiation,
and where 50 -UTR may also exert a negative effect, is between
eIF4G and the poly(A)-binding protein, PABP (57). This interaction is thought to circularize the mRNA (57) and has been
associated with stimulation of 48S preinitiation complex formation (58, 59), 60S subunit joining (59), increased eIF4F capbinding and ATPase activity (60–63), and stabilization of eIF4F–
mRNA interactions in vivo (64). It is not known whether eIF4E
needs to remain bound to the mRNA or is released and available
for formation of new eIF4F complexes (Fig. 1). Consistent with

252 Cancer Res; 75(2) January 15, 2015

the latter possibility is the ﬁnding that the addition of cap
analogues to cell extracts after commencement of translation fails
to block cap-dependent translation (65). Whereas the PABP–
eIF4G interaction is stimulatory but dispensable in yeast cells
(64, 66), it appears critical for translational control of maternal
mRNAs during Xenopus development (67). Whether mRNAs with
elevated structural barriers are less efﬁciently circularized or
require de novo cap recognition by eIF4E at every translational
attempt is unknown, but could be an additional step that renders
"weaker" mRNAs at a disadvantage over their more robust counterparts. Collectively, these studies support the notion that not all
mRNAs are equally "translatable" and that the successful translation of certain mRNAs (i.e., "weak" mRNAs) is dictated by
multiple and cumulative properties mostly associated with that
mRNA's 50 -UTR. Importantly, translation of these "weak" mRNAs,
which typically encode for the potent growth and survival factors
that drive the hallmarks of cancer, is suppressed except under
conditions of enhanced eIF4F activity, that is, during malignant
progression.
Elevated eIF4F activity selectively upregulates translation of a
subset of mRNAs
eIF4E overexpression in experimental cell models elicits only
small increases in overall protein synthesis rates while enabling a
substantial, disproportionate, and selective increase in translation
of a subset of mRNAs. Early attempts at identifying these eIF4Eresponsive mRNAs focused on examining candidates on a one-byone basis. These studies revealed that the production of housekeeping proteins [e.g., actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)] was not altered by changes in eIF4E levels, but
that the translation of mRNAs harboring long, highly structured 50 UTRs [e.g., ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and c-Myc] was profoundly affected by ﬂuctuations in eIF4E levels (68–70). Subsequent genome-wide analyses of changes in translation revealed
that 50 -UTR structure was one determinant of eIF4E or eIF4F
sensitivity, but also uncovered a more complex situation in that
eIF4E-responsive mRNAs did not always appear to possess complex 50 -UTRs. Inhibition of mTOR activity (and therefore eIF4F
assembly) by rapamycin (for 4 hours) in Jurkat T cells, followed by
polysome proﬁling, revealed that the translation of only approximately 6% of expressed genes was inhibited (71). Similarly,
polysome analyses of NIH-3T3 cells transiently overexpressing
eIF4E revealed that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins were
prominently eIF4E-responsive (72). Interestingly, some of these
mRNAs contain a distinct element in their 50 -UTR known as a 50
TOP (50 terminal oligopyrimidine tract) and recent evidence suggests that the RNA-binding protein, LARP1, modulates the translation of this class of mRNAs (73). The relationship between LARP1
and eIF4E responsiveness remains to be fully explored.
More recently, these ﬁndings have been corroborated by ribosome proﬁling analyses, a methodology that relies on deep
sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments to quantify
the translation of mRNAs on a codon-by-codon resolution (74,
75). These studies further reveal a new regulatory element termed
the PRTE (pyrimidine-rich translation element) that interfaces
with eIF4E activity and is essential to control the translation of a
subset of mRNAs encoding key proteins involved in critical steps
of cancer initiation and progression (74, 76). However, the
mechanism by which PRTE elements act to cooperate with eIF4E
to regulate the translation of speciﬁc mRNAs is still under investigation. Additional global approaches probing changes in mRNA

distribution in polysomes as a consequence of altered eIF4F levels
or activity revealed profound effects on the translation of mRNAs
implicated in immune response, cell-cycle progression, and
metabolism (77, 78). Similar to increased eIF4E expression, eIF4E
phosphorylation does not signiﬁcantly increase global protein
synthesis but stimulates the translation of prosurvival (e.g., MCL)
and proinvasion mRNAs (e.g., MMP3 and Snail; refs. 79–81).
Because the cellular translatome at any given time is affected by
upstream regulatory processes, relative mRNA abundance, and
mRNA complexity, the subset of mRNAs responsive to eIF4F can
be expected to vary across tumor types and in response to different
physiologic stimuli.

Critical Oncogenic Signaling Pathways
Converge to Regulate eIF4F Assembly and
Activity
Feed-forward loops drive malignancy—MYC and eIF4F
The MYC transcription factor is one of the most frequently
activated oncogenes in human cancers (82) and has been repeatedly associated with poor prognosis and decreased patient survival (83, 84). A major consequence of elevated MYC activity is a
dramatic elevation in protein synthesis due to increased transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and genes required for
rRNA processing and assembly. This increase in translational
output is a critical determinant for MYC oncogenic activity in
vivo (85). Importantly, elevated MYC also increases transcription
of the core eIF4F components—eIF4E, eIF4AI, and eIF4GI (but
not eIF4AII or eIF4GII; refs. 86–89). Indeed, MYC levels are
elevated in pre-lymphomatous pre-B and pro-B cells isolated
from Em-Myc mice and engender an increase in eIF4F levels
(89). MYC, in turn, is one of the best characterized translationally
controlled mRNAs. Hence, MYC and eIF4F work in a feed-forward
loop, each enhancing the expression of one another. Indeed,
elevated eIF4E consequent to MYC activity has been deemed
necessary to suppress apoptosis resulting from aberrant MYC
activity (90, 91). This intimate relationship affords an opportunity by which part of MYC's function can be interdicted by
inhibiting eIF4F activity (89, 92).
mTOR—regulating eIF4F assembly and activity
The assembly of the eIF4F complex is under the control of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine
kinase whose activity is perturbed in many human cancers
(93). mTOR exists in two functionally distinct complexes.
mTORC2 regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and cell survival,
whereas mTORC1 controls translation initiation, ribosome synthesis, expression of metabolism-related genes, and autophagy
(93). mTORC1 controls eIF4F assembly by liberating both eIF4E
and eIF4A from their respective inhibitory binding proteins,
eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) and programmed cell death 4
(PDCD4). The 4E-BPs (there are three highly related proteins in
mammals with the most well characterized being 4E-BP1) compete with eIF4G for a binding site on eIF4E (94), an interaction
that is regulated by mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBP. Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP binds to eIF4E with high afﬁnity
(nanomolar range) and inhibits translation initiation, whereas
hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP does not bind eIF4E, allowing eIF4F
complexes to form (94).
Similarly, eIF4A availability is regulated downstream of
mTORC1 by the tumor-suppressor gene product PDCD4

www.aacrjournals.org

(95–97). PDCD4 binds to eIF4A, inhibiting its helicase activity
and preventing its binding to eIF4G. PDCD4 is regulated by
S6 kinase, which, when activated by mTORC1, phosphorylates
PDCD4, marking PDCD4 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation,
which then leads to liberation of eIF4A and eIF4F assembly (97).
As noted above, the role of eIF4B is critical to the overall helicase
activity of eIF4A within the eIF4F complex. eIF4B activity is also
controlled downstream of mTOR and Ras–ERK pathway signaling
by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase
(S6K; refs. 98–101). Phosphorylation of eIF4B on Ser422
increases its interaction with eIF4A and eIF3 and is required for
ribosome recruitment to mRNAs containing secondary structure
(98–100). Moreover, recombinant eIF4B, which is presumably
not phosphorylated, cannot substitute for native eIF4B in this
assay (32). Hence, the phosphorylation status of eIF4B affects
mRNA discrimination, possibly by inﬂuencing eIF4A activity.
Regulation by phosphorylation—Ras and MAPK signaling
converge on eIF4F
Increased signaling ﬂux through the Ras—Raf–Erk pathway is a
frequent occurrence in many human cancer types often consequent to mutational activation of Ras or Raf oncogenes or activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., EGFR). Constitutive activation of this pathway enhances the assembly and
activity of the eIF4F complex in multiple ways. Activation of Erk
and p90RSK can phosphorylate TSC2 activating mTORC1, which
would promote eIF4F assembly (102). Ras pathway signaling also
directly impinges upon eIF4F activity. Early studies by RinkerSchaeffer and colleagues (103) revealed that oncogenic Ras dramatically increased the rate of eIF4E phosphorylation. Subsequent work has now shown that ras pathway signaling through
ERK stimulates the MNK kinases to interact with eIF4G and
phosphorylate eIF4E at serine 209 (104–107).
What are the consequences of eIF4E phosphorylation? At this
point, we do not have a complete picture. Mouse knockout studies
have revealed that MNK1 and MNK2 are dispensable for normal
development (108) and eIF4ES209A/S209A knockin mice display no
obvious phenotype (80). Several studies have documented
increased translation as a consequence of eIF4E phosphorylation
(80, 104), yet phosphorylation of eIF4E lowers its afﬁnity for the
cap structure (109–112). This conundrum can be explained if one
posits that the reduced cap afﬁnity is associated with increased
recycling of eIF4E once functional 43S preinitiation complexes
have been successfully recruited to the 50 -end (113). Regardless,
the phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine 209 has been shown in
multiple reports to be absolutely critical to the oncogenic function
of eIF4E (79, 80, 114).

Elevated eIF4F Function Drives Cellular
Transformation, Tumorigenesis, and
Malignant Progression
eIF4E in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis
The landmark study by Lazaris-Karatzas and colleagues (115)
was the ﬁrst to demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of eIF4E
was oncogenic in NIH-3T3 cells, driving cellular transformation
(focus formation and soft agar colonization) and tumorigenesis.
Further highlighting the importance of eIF4E function in cellular
transformation and tumorigenesis, engineered reduction of eIF4E
by antisense eIF4E RNA profoundly suppressed the transformed
phenotype of highly aggressive, Ras oncogene–transformed

ﬁbrosarcomas, reducing soft agar colonization more than 90%,
increasing tumor latency periods, and reducing tumor growth
rates (116). Furthermore, development of an eIF4E transgenic
mouse established eIF4E as a bona ﬁde oncogene in vivo. Indeed, in
vivo constitutive overexpression of eIF4E alone leads to increased
cancer susceptibility, demonstrated by the wide spectrum of
tumors that develop in these mice, including lymphomas, angiosarcomas, lung carcinomas, and hepatomas (117). As well, in vivo
overexpression of eIF4E within the B-cell compartment cooperates with c-Myc in lymphomagenesis as eIF4E counteracts MYCinduced apoptosis, a critical barrier to tumor formation (117,
118). These and other studies showed that elevated levels of eIF4E
can recapitulate key oncogenic functions of Akt (118) and antagonize the proapoptotic activity of c-Myc (90, 91, 117, 118).
The phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser209 also plays an important role in eIF4E's oncogenic function (114). In MYC-driven
lymphomas, eIF4E expression accelerates lymphomagenesis,
whereas overexpression of an eIF4E S209A mutant is incapable
of accelerating disease in this model (79). Similarly, in a PTEN
knockout model of prostate cancer, knockin of the nonphosphorylatable eIF4E S209A mutant delays progression of prostate
cancer (80). Consistent with these data, inhibition of MNK
activity delays tumor development and outgrowth of metastases
(119, 120). Mice homozygously deleted for both MNK1 and
MNK2 are viable (108) making the targeting of this activity
attractive for the development of novel antineoplastic agents.
Increased Ras signaling (121) or altered eIF4E phosphorylation
(80, 81) enhances the translation of a subset of mRNAs, with
some encoding functions in cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis (81).
The prevailing data from these studies indicate that the
oncogenic effects of eIF4E are a result of activated eIF4F rather
than a unique function of eIF4E overexpression (122, 123).
Early work showed eIF4E-mediated transformation to be particularly dependent on the enhanced translation of ODC and
cyclin D1 mRNAs (68, 124–126). Subsequent work has continued to highlight the role that eIF4E plays in driving cellular
transformation—selectively enhancing the translation of a limited pool of mRNAs whose protein products play an integral
role in malignancy—c-MYC, cyclin D1, ODC, VEGF, among
others (127). Importantly, a few common themes have consistently emerged from this body of work. Chief among these is
that very modest changes in expression of eIF4E are required to
affect malignancy. Indeed, only 2- to 3-fold increases in eIF4E
are sufﬁcient to drive cellular transformation, whereas only a
50% to 60% reduction in eIF4E expression is necessary to block
tumor formation and growth (116–118, 125, 128, 129).
eIF4E as a central regulator of metastatic progression
Beyond the initial changes that enable cellular transformation and expansion of a primary tumor, metastatic progression
requires that tumors acquire a wide range of phenotypic characteristics, including the ability to establish autocrine growth
and survival signaling, escape from the primary tumor site,
invade surrounding normal tissue, disseminate through the
blood or lymphatic circulation, establish and survive within
the foreign microenvironment of the distal tissue site, and
outgrow as a metastatic colony. Although diverse stimuli that
regulate the transcription of the critical gene products drive
these phenotypes, the synthesis of these proteins is coordinately elevated by eIF4E and eIF4F (130, 131).

254 Cancer Res; 75(2) January 15, 2015

The ﬁrst evidence supporting a role for eIF4E in the metastatic
process was revealed by antisense RNA studies in highly aggressive
ras-transformed ﬁbroblasts. Depletion of eIF4E by approximately
50% in these cells reduced the number of metastases formed in the
lungs of mice following tail vein injection by up to 90% (128).
Moreover, when implanted under the renal capsule, these same
cells failed to invade the kidney parenchyma. Importantly, when
metastases derived from these cells were examined, levels of eIF4E
had been restored to that of the parental Ras-transformed cells,
indicating a selection in vivo for enhanced eIF4E function (128).
Similarly, in breast cancer models, pharmacologic suppression of
mTOR activity, which limits eIF4E availability and reduces eIF4F
complex levels, diminished invasiveness and migration, as well as
the formation of pulmonary metastases, thus delaying breast
cancer progression (123).
Early overexpression studies have also implicated elevated
eIF4E levels in driving not only tumorigenesis but also metastasis.
Rat embryo ﬁbroblasts engineered to overexpress eIF4E formed
lung metastases both spontaneously after subcutaneous tumor
growth, and experimentally following tail vein injection (128).
Moreover, cells derived from these tumors and lung nodules
showed elevated eIF4E expression levels, again indicating a selection for enhanced eIF4E function with malignant progression in
vivo (128). Collectively, these data strongly implicate eIF4E, and
by extension eIF4F, as a critical driver of metastatic progression.
To survive and grow in the primary tumor site, and especially
within the foreign microenvironment of the metastatic site, tumor
cells acquire growth factor autonomy, often through the establishment of autocrine growth factor networks. In the rat embryo
ﬁbroblast model, eIF4E overexpression enabled the establishment of an autocrine stimulatory loop involving enhanced signaling through the ERK pathway (130, 132). Importantly, the
progressive selection in vivo for more aggressive tumor behavior
(reduced tumor latency, enhanced metastatic potential, and
reduced mouse survival) selected for increased eIF4E expression
as well as enhanced signaling through the ERK pathway
(130, 132). In the NIH3T3 model, eIF4E overexpression was
shown to drive tumorigenesis via the establishment of a Rasdependent autocine loop (116).
Collectively, these studies indicate that eIF4E plays a key
regulatory role in metastasis. Another aspect of metastatic progression is the ability of tumor cells to establish a new vascular
network. In experimental models of breast and head and neck
cancers, eIF4E overexpression was shown to promote the overexpression of the potent angiogenic factors VEGF (133) and FGF2
(134), in both cases by selectively enhancing translation of these
mRNAs. Immunohistochemical surveys of both breast and head
and neck cancers have further supported the link among eIF4E
overexpression, VEGF overexpression, and enhanced microvessel
density (135, 136). These data suggest that eIF4E may indirectly
govern tumor-related angiogenesis by enabling the enhanced
translation of critical angiogenic factors from the tumor cell
compartment. Indeed, treatment of nude mice bearing human
breast or prostate cancer xenografts with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting eIF4E effectively reduced eIF4E expression in these tumors and profoundly reduced tumor vascularity.
Importantly, in in vitro cord formation assays, depletion of eIF4E
by ASO transfection suppressed the ability of endothelial cells to
form vessel-like structures, suggesting for the ﬁrst time that eIF4E
may also directly govern the response of endothelial cells to
angiogenic stimuli (129). Similar results were observed when the

Deregulated eIF4F Activity in Tumorigenesis

eIF4A helicase subunit of eIF4F was targeted with the smallmolecule inhibitor, silvestrol (137).
In addition to the establishment of a vascular network, metastatic progression requires persistent cellular survival, not only at
the primary tumor site but also within the foreign microenvironment of a metastatic site. Numerous studies have linked enhanced
eIF4E expression to the suppression of apoptosis. The earliest
demonstration of this was that eIF4E upregulation was necessary
in MYC-induced malignancies to overcome MYC-induced apoptosis (90). The mechanism could be explained by enhanced synthesis
of BCL-XL and blockade of mitochondrial cytochrome C release
(138). Subsequent work showed that eIF4E regulated the translation of a network of mRNAs encoding antiapoptotic proteins
(139). Most prominent amongst these was osteopontin (139), a
protein that has been repeatedly implicated in metastasis (140).
Additional work also highlighted the translational regulation of
additional antiapoptotic proteins by eIF4E, including BI-1, dad1,
and survivin (72), as well as BCL-2 (129, 141, 142). In the Em-myc
B-cell lymphoma model, enforced expression of eIF4E clearly
promoted tumor cell survival and chemoresistance (118), in part,
by upregulating translation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 (79).
The ability of tumor cells to break from the primary tumor
mass, invade surrounding normal tissues, and ultimately disseminate to distal tissue sites requires the remodeling and degradation
of the extracellular matrix. This process is driven by expression and
secretion of protein-degrading enzymes, most notably the matrix
metalloproteases (MMP). In Ras-transformed rat embryo ﬁbroblasts, reduction of eIF4E levels by only approximately 50%
resulted in a remarkable reduction in the expression of MMP-9,
concomitant with a marked diminution in invasiveness. Interestingly, the cells selected for increased aggressiveness in vivo
regained eIF4E levels as well as MMP-9 expression levels (128).
Similarly, in murine prostate carcinoma cells, MMP-9 is translationally controlled and associated with increased malignancy
(143). More recently, in a murine model of prostate carcinoma
progression, knockin of the nonphosphorylatable eIF4E (S209A)mutant allele suppressed disease progression and speciﬁcally
reduced the translation of a subset of mRNAs critical for progression, including MMP-9 and MMP-3 (80). Moreover, heparanase
production, an enzyme implicated in the metastatic process and
angiogenesis due to degradation of heparin sulfate proteoglycans
with subsequent destruction of the basement membrane, is eIF4E
responsive and is decreased when eIF4E levels are reduced by ASO
(144). Further highlighting a role for eIF4E in tumor cell invasiveness, Robichaud and colleagues (81) have shown that eIF4E
Ser209 phosphorylation plays a prominent role in regulating the
TGFb-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition by
controlling the translation of a pool of mRNAs critical for EMT,
including Snail and MMP-3. Consistent with these genetic studies,
pharmacologic inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation profoundly
suppressed the outgrowth of lung metastases in the B16 melanoma model (120).
Studies using ribosome proﬁling have revealed that oncogenic
eIF4E activity, downstream of mTOR signaling, has a striking
effect on the translational landscape of the cancer genome,
particularly in the context of metastasis (74). This study has
functionally characterized a novel subset of translationally regulated mRNAs associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis
in vivo. These mRNAs include vimentin, MTA1 (metastasis associated 1), CD44, and YB-1 (Y-box–binding protein 1; also called
YBX1) and have critical roles in controlling cell migration, metas-

www.aacrjournals.org

tasis, and EMT (145). Mechanistically, eIF4E regulates the translation of these mRNAs, at least in part, through the PRTE, a
regulatory element that is present in their 50 -UTRs. Signiﬁcantly,
INK128, a clinical ATP-site inhibitor of mTOR, blocks the
increased translation of these eIF4E sensitive mRNAs with therapeutic beneﬁt at all stages of prostate cancer progression, including metastasis (74). Elevated expression of eIF4E is common in a
wide array of human cancers (colorectal, breast, prostate, and
lymphoma; ref. 69). Importantly, in many studies, elevated eIF4E
expression has been linked to advanced disease and/or reduced
survival (69, 146, 147). Recent work has now also shown that 4EBP1 is hyperphosphorylated in human cancers (notably ovarian
and prostate carcinomas) and also associated with reduced
patient survival (69, 141, 146–148).
eIF4E and chemoresponsiveness
Altered eIF4E levels modify tumor cell drug sensitivity. Increased
eIF4E levels have been associated with resistance to front-line
therapy (e.g., doxorubicin; ref. 118) and rapamycin (149) in the
Em-Myc lymphoma model (118). Elevated eIF4E levels are also
associated with resistance to PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors (150,
151). In a report documenting resistance to anti-BRAF and antiMEK therapies, eIF4F levels correlated with drug response with
increased levels associated with diminished efﬁcacy (152).
Increased eIF4E phosphorylation has been associated with expression of BRAFV600E in melanocytes (153). Targeting the eIF4E–
eIF4G interaction or eIF4A activity synergizes with anti-BRAF
therapy (152). A recent shRNA screen targeting the translatome
in multiple myeloma identiﬁed all three subunits of eIF4F (eIF4E,
eIF4AI, and eIF4GI) as modiﬁers of dexamethasone response in
this tumor type. Inhibition of eIF4F by small molecules synergized
with dexamethasone as well as resensitized previously unresponsive cells (154). It will be important to identify the translational
landscape responsible for these effects so as to obtain mechanistic
insight and to distinguish between effects due to synergy versus
resensitization of a previously resistant phenotype.

Breaking Bad Addictions—Targeting eIF4F
Over the last 10 years, there has been signiﬁcant interest in
targeting the activity of the eIF4F complex. The knowledge that
eIF4F assembly is under mTOR control was the ﬁrst stepping stone
toward this. The ﬁnding that MYC is one of the most frequently
ampliﬁed genes in human cancers (155), coupled with an appreciation of its regulatory relationship with eIF4F, helped further
fuel this interest. Targeting translation as an antineoplastic
approach is not new. Depletion of asparagine pools with asparaginase inhibits translation elongation and is used to treat acute
lymphoblastic leukemia and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia
(156). Moreover, homoharringtonine, an inhibitor of translation
elongation has been approved by the FDA for treatment of chronic
myeloid leukemia (157). A large body of biologic data ranging
from cell-based and preclinical models assays suppressing eIF4E,
eIF4A, and eIF4F support the idea that targeting eIF4F activity
would be antineoplastic (reviewed in ref. 158). For example,
eIF4E oncogenic activity downstream of AKT-mTOR hyperactivation is severely compromised in 4EBPM transgenic mice, which
express an inducible mutant form of 4EBP1 that can no longer be
phosphorylated by mTOR (159). In these mice, initiation, maintenance, and progression of Akt-mediated T-cell lymphomagenesis are dramatically thwarted, leading to increased overall

survival. Mechanistically, the anti-oncogenic effects of the 4EBPM
protein are due at least in part to the decreased translation of
the MCL1 anti-apoptotic factor in early T cell progenitors
(159). Experiments targeting eIF4E using antisense RNA
(116, 129), or peptides to interfere with eIF4E–eIF4G interaction
(160–162), demonstrated suppression of the oncogenic properties of transformed cell lines ex vivo and/or tumor growth in vivo.
Most telling, the development of a mouse model in which eIF4E
expression can be inducibly suppressed by shRNAs engineered to
be under doxycycline responsiveness afforded an alternative,
genetic approach to pharmacologically targeting eIF4F activity in
vivo (89). Using this model to suppress eIF4E in pre-lymphomatous B cells in Em-Myc mice revealed signiﬁcantly delayed tumor
onset and demonstrated a tolerance for suppressed eIF4E levels at
the organismal level, thus underscoring eIF4F's status as an
important marker for tumor-speciﬁc vulnerability in vivo (89).
A further key functional link between MYC and mTOR has been
recently described, where MYC directs mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBP1, without affecting other mTOR substrates
such as S6K (92). Taken together, these ﬁndings reveal a critical
vulnerability for MYC overexpressing cancer cells that may rely on
eIF4E availability for cancer cell survival (89, 92). Indeed, blocking 4E-BP phosphorylation either genetically or pharmacologically with the ATP-site inhibitor INK128, results in a dramatic
reduction of lymphomagenesis in Em-Myc mice (92).
The eIF4F complex offers multiple possibilities for functional
interdiction, some of which have been probed with small-molecule inhibitors in high-throughput screens. These include blocking eIF4E–cap interaction, interfering with eIF4E–eIF4G interaction, inhibiting eIF4A helicase activity, and suppressing eIF4E
levels.
Targeting eIF4E function
Although cap analogues have been used to probe eIF4E–cap
interaction since the late 1970s, their use has been limited to in vitro
experiments because they are not readily cell permeable (163, 164).
[Ribavirin has been reported to behave as a cap analogue ex vivo
(165). However, this has been challenged (166, 167). Importantly,
in over 100 antitumor screens involving over 10 different xenograft
models, ribavirin failed to show any efﬁcacy as a single agent
(http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/dtpstandard/servlet/dwindex?searchtype¼
namestarts&chemnameboolean¼and&outputformat¼html&
searchlist¼ribavirin%0D%0A&Submit¼Submit). Any biologic
outcomes observed with ribavirin are therefore unlikely to be the
consequence of inhibiting translation.] Therefore, efforts have
recently focused on developing prodrugs, with modiﬁcations that
would allow the nucleosides to enter the cell followed by conversion to active inhibitors. Accordingly, one compound, 4Ei-1,
inhibited cap-dependent translation in vitro and in vivo when
injected into zebraﬁsh embryos (168). 4Ei-1 chemosensitized
breast and lung cancer cells to nontoxic levels of the cytotoxic
drug gemcitabine (169). 4Ei-1 reduced proliferation and repressed colony formation in mesothelioma cells and sensitized
these to pemetrexed, a folate antimetabolite (170). Several inhibitors of eIF4E–eIF4G interaction have also been discovered
(4EGI-1, 4E1RCat, and 4E2RCat) and shown to inhibit cancer
cell growth ex vivo, breast cancer xenograft growth in vivo, and
reverse chemoresistance in MYC-driven murine lymphomas
(171, 172).
ASO against eIF4E [LY2275796 (a.k.a. ISIS EIF4E Rx)] have
been tested in cell lines ex vivo and in xenograft models with

256 Cancer Res; 75(2) January 15, 2015

promising activity (129). Here, translation of known eIF4Especiﬁc progrowth and prosurvival gene products (c-Myc, cyclin
D1, VEGF, Bcl-2, and survivin) was reduced by LY2275796,
while global protein synthesis was only modestly affected. A
phase I trial demonstrated that LY2275796 could be safely
administered to patients and was effective at decreasing eIF4E
mRNA and protein levels in tumor cells (173). In this study, 30
patients with stage IV disease received LY2275796 for three
consecutive days and then were maintained on this compound
by weekly administration for 3 additional consecutive weeks.
The most common drug-related cytotoxicities reported were
fatigue (47%), nausea (33%), fever (27%), and vomiting (20%;
ref. 173). The compound was effective at reducing eIF4E mRNA
in vivo by 80% in posttreatment biopsies (compared with
pretreatment biopsies; ref. 173). Phase II clinical trials are now
under way combining ISIS EIF4E Rx with carboplatin and
paclitaxel for non–small cell lung cancer (NCT01234038) or
with docetaxel and prednisone for castration-resistant prostate
cancer (NCT01234025).
Inhibiting eIF4A activity
A high-throughput screen based on the differential inhibition
of translation of eIF4F-dependent versus hepatitis C virus internal
ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent reporter mRNAs identiﬁed
three natural products [pateamine A (Pat A), hippuristanol, and
silvestrol] that selectively target eIF4A (174–176). The binding
site for hippuristanol has been mapped to the carboxyl terminal
domain of eIF4A, but the binding sites of Pat A and silvestrol are
not known. Hippuristanol prevents eIF4A from binding RNA
(175, 177), whereas Pat A and silvestrol act as chemical inducers
of dimerization and force a nonsequence speciﬁc engagement
between eIF4A and RNA, resulting in depletion of eIF4A from the
eIF4F complex (137, 176, 178). Pat A inhibits translation irreversibly (likely the consequence of a Michael addition site on the
molecule), whereas inhibition by hippuristanol or silvestrol is
readily reversible. All compounds (or derivatives thereof) exhibit
antineoplastic activity in various xenograft mouse tumor models
as single agents (137, 179–182). Hippuristanol and silvestrol
reverse drug resistance in MYC-driven tumor models (176, 183).
Of the three eIF4A inhibitors, silvestrol and the related rocaglamide family members show the most favorable pharmacologic
properties for in vivo studies. Systemic availability for silvestrol
when delivered intraperitoneally is 100%, with 60% of the
parental compound remaining after 6 hours (184). Silvestrol
does not cause weight loss, liver damage, or immunosuppression
in mice (137). B cells derived from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are more sensitive to silvestrol than B cells from
healthy individuals (182), suggesting preferential targeting of
faster growing leukemic cells. The antiproliferative properties
of silvestrol appear to be mediated primarily through inhibition
of eIF4A because silvestrol-resistant eIF4A mutants can rescue the
effect (185). As expected, the translation of mRNAs with extensive
secondary structure is more sensitive to inhibition by silvestrol
(137, 186–188). A current barrier to the clinical development of
silvestrol is that resistance can develop due to overexpression of
the ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (186, 189).
Preventing eIF4E phosphorylation
Blocking eIF4E phosphorylation has been shown to prevent
the oncogenic function of eIF4E in multiple experimental
models (79, 80, 120), suggesting that pharmacologic inhibition

Deregulated eIF4F Activity in Tumorigenesis

Not All Roads Lead to Rome—The
Differential Consequences of Targeting
eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G
Inhibition of eIF4E by TOR inhibitors (rapamycin, PP242,
INK128; ref. 194) or LY2275796 (129) does not dramatically
reduce global protein synthesis. For example, LY2275796
causes an 80% reduction in eIF4E levels with only a modest
impact on global protein synthesis (20% change; ref. 129). In
contrast, inhibition of eIF4A has a much more profound effect
on global protein synthesis (176). These results could be
explained if the bulk of ongoing translation requires high
concentrations of eIF4A, but not eIF4E, to be sustained. This
is consistent with a model in which eIF4E recycles following the
initial cap binding: eIF4G:eIF4A dimers would then be sufﬁcient to maintain multiple subsequent rounds of initiation (Fig.
1). In this scenario, acute inhibition of eIF4A is expected to
have a more immediate effect on translation than a block in
eIF4E activity.
Overexpression of eIF4GI in NIH-3T3 cells is oncogenic (195).
This may be a consequence of its ability to stimulate IRESmediated translation of transcripts encoding key oncogenic functions (70, 196, 197). This is of clinical relevance because inﬂammatory breast cancers (IBC) display high levels of eIF4GI (with
little change in eIF4E or 4E-BP1 levels). This has been linked to
IRES-mediated translation of VEGFA and p120 catenin, which are
required for progression to metastasis (198). Thus, in the setting
of IBC, it would make more sense to target eIF4GI (and possibly
eIF4A) rather than eIF4E.
Consistent with reports that document differential translational responses to eIF4E versus eIF4A inhibitors is the ﬁnding of a
unique translation/transcription regulatory element, called TISU
(translation initiator of short 50 -UTR; 50 -SAASATGGCGGC-30 , in
which S is C or G; ref. 199). TISUs are present in approximately
4.5% of protein-encoding genes, most of which have unusually
short 50 -UTRs (12nt; ref. 199). Translation of TISU-containing
mRNAs is cap-dependent, but much less dependent on eIF4A
(200). Perhaps, the extreme cap-proximal location of the AUG

www.aacrjournals.org

initiation codon on TISU mRNAs signiﬁcantly diminishes the
scanning requirement for eIF4A-dependent unwinding.

Conclusion—Pushing eIF4F Out of the
Goldilocks Zone
The Goldilocks principle posits that parameters to maintain a
speciﬁc state need to fall within a certain margin, or zone, to
favor a particular outcome. For example, the distance of the
earth from the sun is within a "Goldilocks zone" and hence
favorable to life as we know it. The same analogy can be applied
to the relationship between eIF4F activity and tumor cell
homeostasis. The translational output of a tumor cell needs
to fall within a "Goldilocks zone" to optimally support its
proteastasis (Fig. 2). Too much eIF4F activity is deleterious to
the cell, and too little eIF4F activity precludes cellular transformation. Indeed, the preponderance of experimental work
has revealed that cellular transformation requires only 2- to 3fold increased eIF4E expression, whereas depletion of eIF4E
activity by only approximately 50% can reverse the transformed
and malignant phenotype (116, 117, 118, 125, 128, 129).
Perhaps most important for the therapeutic potential of targeting the eIF4F complex is the consistent observation from many
experimental studies that malignant cells seem to be tuned to
this "Goldilocks zone" of eIF4F activity. That is, malignant cells
have selected for a certain enhanced translational output (i.e.,
enhanced eIF4F activity) necessary for the manifestation of the
varied phenotypes responsible for tumor formation and metastatic progression—growth factor autonomy, angiogenesis,
enhanced cellular survival, invasiveness, and metastatic outgrowth. The particular dependence of malignant cells on this
"zone" of enhanced eIF4F activity makes these cells especially
susceptible to eIF4F inhibition. Indeed, in multiple preclinical
studies in vivo, inhibition of eIF4F activity (via inhibition of eIF4E,
Mnk, or eIF4A) profoundly affected malignant cells, inducing
tumor cell death, cessation of tumor growth, and repression

Goldilocks zone

Cell fitness

of the Mnk kinases may be promising. Indeed, the Mnk inhibitors, CGP57380 and cercosporamide, have been shown to
block eIF4E phosphorylation in cultured cells, limiting cellular
proliferation in large part by inducing apoptosis
(120, 190, 191). Similarly, (5-(2-(-(phenylamino)pyrimidin4-yl)thiazol-2(3H)-one derivatives have been shown to inhibit
MNK2, reduce eIF4E phosphorylation, and diminish Mcl-1
expression in cancer cells (192). In animal models, oral administration of cercosporamide suppressed eIF4E phosphorylation
in normal mouse tissues and xenograft tumor tissues. Importantly, cercosporamide administration profoundly suppressed
the outgrowth of B16 melanoma metastases (120). A more
recent report also showed that cercosporamide treatment at
doses that speciﬁcally inhibited eIF4E phosphorylation
decreased the growth rate of AML xenografted tumors and
suppressed colonization of freshly explanted AML patient
samples (193). Importantly, the biologic effects of cercosporamide on AML cells reﬂected MNK inhibition (i.e., reduced
eIF4E phosphorylation) and did not reﬂect inhibition of Jak3, a
putative additional target of cercosporamide (193). The precise
consequence of MNK inhibition on tumor cell behavior will
require additional studies.

of metastatic outgrowth without substantially affecting normal
cellular and organismal function (120, 129, 137, 173). For example, intravenous administration of the eIF4E ASO dropped eIF4E
levels in the liver of treated, xenograft-bearing mice >80% without
affecting liver enzymes or body weight. Yet, in these same animals,
a reduction in eIF4E expression in the xenografted tumor of only
50% to 60% was sufﬁcient to robustly induce apoptosis and ﬂatline xenograft tumor growth (129).
As detailed above, the sustained translation of a speciﬁc subset
of mRNAs is a key to enabling tumor maintenance and metastatic
progression—that is to allow for the enhanced, selective expression of the potent growth, and survival factors that regulate tumor
cell survival, angiogenesis, growth factor autonomy, invasiveness,
and metastasis. The question arises as to which eIF4E-responsive
mRNA(s) is/are particularly critical and whether this is expected to
vary among tumor types. If the latter were true, this would entail
the development of robust biomarkers to inform on eIF4F dysregulation and inhibition unique to each tumor type—a truly
daunting task.
However, the situation may not be this complicated. First,
high-resolution analysis of copy-number variations from
>3,000 cancer samples representing largely 26 different cancer
types has documented that among the top 20 most common
ampliﬁcations are four genes encoding key oncogenic drivers
and tumor maintenance factors, whose mRNAs are eIF4Eresponsive: MYC, MCL1, BCL2L1(BCL-xL), and CCND1
(155). Although the expression of these proteins may be
elevated because of ampliﬁcation events, if the translation of
their mRNAs remains eIF4E-dependent, inhibition of eIF4F
[coupled with the naturally rapid turnover of the MYC, MCL1,
and CCND1 proteins (201, 202)], is expected to cause a rapid
depletion of these proteins and have a dramatic consequence
on tumor cell homeostasis—shifting cells out of the Goldilocks
zone. MYC, MCL1, and CCND1 have been difﬁcult to "drug"
directly, and thus inhibiting their production at the translation
level is one strategy to overcome this problem.
Targeting the eIF4F complex may potentially bode well for
dealing with the intratumoral heterogeneity that drives malignant
progression and treatment resistance (203). Intratumoral heterogeneity arises from the diverse selection pressures imposed upon
the tumor cell population and may reﬂect genetic, epigenetic
and/or cellular changes. The manifestation of this diversity must
involve changes in translational output—i.e., in eIF4F activity.

Indeed, the eIF4F complex sits at the junction of numerous, potent
oncogenic pathways: Ras–Raf–ERK, Myc, and PI3K–TOR pathways, which, in turn, may also be activated by other divergent
oncogenic stimuli [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinase activation
(EGFR)]. As such, these divergent pathways—which reﬂect the
underlying cellular, genetic, and epigenetic heterogeneity of the
tumor—are critically reliant upon the activity of the eIF4F node
for the alterations to the proteome that give rise to phenotypic
heterogeneity driving malignant progression and therapeutic
resistance. Hence, targeting this complex—this critical node of
convergence for so many divergent oncogenic stimuli—may
provide a powerful means to address the intratumoral heterogeneity that plagues current cancer therapy.
We have come a long way since the discovery of the mRNA cap
structure and fundamental studies that deﬁned its biochemical
and biologic function. One could never have predicted that these
fundamental studies would have led to such a profound interest
in targeting the eIF4F complex, particularly for the treatment of
cancer. The thrust to "translate" these ﬁndings to the clinic
provides a substantial challenge and will continue to demand
rigorous, concerted scientiﬁc partnership between academia and
industry. There exists ample opportunities to leverage and
advance our current knowledge of the eIF4F complex to develop
new therapies to inhibit the translation of mRNAs encoding
oncogenic functions.
