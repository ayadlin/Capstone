BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that multivariate prediction models predict cancer outcomes more
accurately than cancer stage; however, the effects of these models on clinical management are unclear. The
objective of the current study was to determine whether a previously published multivariate prediction model for
bladder cancer (‘‘bladder nomogram’’) improved medical decision making when referral for adjuvant chemotherapy was used as a model. METHODS: Data were analyzed from an international cohort study of 4462 patients
who underwent cystectomy without chemotherapy from 1969 to 2004. The number of patients eligible for chemotherapy was determined using pathologic stage criteria (lymph node-positive disease or pathologic T3 [pT3] or
pT4 tumor classification) and for 3 cutoff levels on the bladder nomogram (10%, 25%, and 70% risk of recurrence
with surgery alone). The number of recurrences was calculated by applying a relative risk reduction to the baseline risk among eligible patients. Clinical net benefit was then calculated by combining recurrences and treatments and weighting the latter by a factor related to drug tolerability. RESULTS: A nomogram cutoff
outperformed pathologic stage for chemotherapy in every scenario of drug effectiveness and tolerability. For a
drug with a relative risk of 0.80, with which clinicians would treat 20 patients to prevent 1 recurrence, use of
the nomogram was equivalent to a strategy that resulted in 60 fewer chemotherapy treatments per 1000
patients without any increase in recurrence rates. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that referring patients
who undergo cystectomy to adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of a multivariate model is likely to lead to better patient outcomes than the use of pathologic stage. Further research is warranted to evaluate the clinical

Decision Analysis of Bladder Model/Vickers et al

Many decisions in oncology depend implicitly or
explicitly on predictions. These predictions normally are
thought of in terms of ‘‘risk’’; typically, we act when a
patient is deemed at sufficiently high risk that the benefits
of intervention, in terms of reducing risk, outweigh the
harms, in terms of toxicities. Most commonly, decisions
that involve prediction are based on risk categories. The
most common system for risk categorization in cancer is
cancer stage, with more aggressive treatments reserved for
patients with higher stage disease. Stage can influence the
extent of surgery, such as in breast cancer or bladder cancer; the intensity of chemotherapy, such as in lymphoma;
and whether adjuvant therapy is indicated, such as in
bladder cancer or colon cancer.
Recent years have seen an upsurge of interest in multivariate prediction models. Typically, these models provide a numerical estimate of risk in the form of a
probability on the basis of several tumor and patient characteristics. The well known ‘‘Kattan nomogram,’’ for
example, provides the probability of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy on the basis of stage,
grade, and prostate-specific antigen level.1 Numerous
similar models have been published for a variety of different cancers2-6 and for specific treatment decisions, such as
adjuvant chemotherapy after breast cancer.7 It appears
reasonable that such models might predict more accurately than simple staging systems, because they include
additional prognostic information. For example, a patient
with high-grade, organ-confined prostate cancer most
likely is at a higher risk of recurrence than a patient at a
similar stage but with low-grade disease. Empirical studies
have confirmed that multivariate models provide more
accurate predictions than American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) staging or other simple risk groupings in a
wide variety of cancers, including melanoma,8 gastric cancer,9 pancreatic cancer,10 and prostate cancer.11 In the
case of bladder cancer, the topic of the current report, the
predictive accuracy of a multivariate model for recurrence
after radical cystectomy (the ‘‘bladder cancer nomogram’’)
was a concordance index of 0.75 compared with only 0.68
for the AJCC TNM classification and 0.62 for standard
pathologic stage.12
Nonetheless, the clinical implications of an
improved concordance index are not immediately
obvious. We may be able to predict better who is at high
risk of death from bladder cancer; however, this may
Cancer

make little practical difference to patient care. We are
interested in defining better whether using the bladder
cancer nomogram would improve clinical decision making, such as whether a patient should receive adjuvant
chemotherapy. To address this question, we examined a
recent multivariate prediction model, the bladder cancer
nomogram, using decision analytic methods.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The collection of data for the International Bladder Cancer Nomogram Consortium has been described previously.12 In total, data on 9064 patients who underwent
radical cystectomy were collected from 13 institutions in
6 countries. Because we wanted to estimate the risk of recurrence after radical cystectomy alone, we excluded
patients who had received systemic adjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or definitive pelvic
radiotherapy (n ¼ 2001) and patients for whom pelvic
radiotherapy status was unknown (n ¼ 319). Of the
remaining patients, 871 were not followed for recurrence,
and 1411 were excluded because of missing data on variables that were included in the nomogram. Therefore, our
sample consisted of 4462 patients who were managed by
radical cystectomy only, who were followed for disease recurrence, and who had complete data for all predictors:
sex, age, pathologic stage, histology, lymph node status,
grade, and time between diagnosis and cystectomy. The
proportion of patients by institution was similar to that
previously reported.12

Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Bladder Cancer
Our interest in this study was adjuvant rather than salvage
chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy commonly is
given to high-risk bladder cancer patients after radical cystectomy. Two separate groups have published meta-analyses of randomized trials and reported similar findings
suggesting a survival benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy.
Ruggeri et al pooled data from 5 phase 3 trials and
reported a statistically significant improvement in diseasefree survival in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 0.54-0.78) for disease-free survival.13 The Advanced

and specificity for survival time data, we first define x ¼ 1
if the patient is classified as being at high risk and x ¼ 0
otherwise; s(t) is the Kaplan-Meier survival probability at
time t, which we predefined as 5 years. According to the
method described by Begg et al,17 we used the following
formula for sensitivity and specificity:
Sensitivity ¼ ½1  ðsðtÞjx ¼ 1Þ  Pðx ¼ 1Þ  ½1  sðtÞ;
and
Specificity ¼ ðsðtÞjx ¼ 0Þ  Pðx ¼ 0Þ  sðtÞ:
FIGURE 1. This chart from sensitivity analyses illustrates how
relative risk (RR) varied under various assumptions for the
relation between absolute risk and RR. Gray solid line indicates constant RR; gray dashed line, treatment most effective
for low-risk patients; black dashed line, treatment most effective for high-risk patients; black solid line, treatment most
effective for average-risk patients.

Bladder Cancer Meta-Analysis Collaboration14 included
an additional trial and performed individual patient data
analysis: Those investigators reported a hazard ratio of
0.68 (95% CI, 0.53-0,89). These numbers are approximately equivalent to a relative risk (RR) of recurrence at 5
years of approximately 0.75. However, given the relatively
limited number of patients included in these meta-analyses (<500), and the accordingly wide 95% CIs, we
planned to use a variety of different estimates of RR in our
analyses.

Statistical Analysis
Eligibility for adjuvant chemotherapy depends on a decision rule for the identification of high-risk patients. With
respect to bladder cancer, patients who have pathologic
T3 (pT3) or pT4 disease or those with positive lymph
nodes generally are considered at high risk for disease recurrence and, thus, according to standard guidelines, are
eligible for chemotherapy; lymph node-negative patients
with organ-confined disease (<pT3) are re followed by
observation only after surgery.15 We wanted to compare
this eligibility criterion with 1 of 3 prespecified rules based
on the nomogram-predicted risk of recurrence at 5 years:
10%, 25%, and 70%.
Our overall statistical approach follows a previously
published methodology.16 In brief, to calculate sensitivity
5462

Assuming a constant RR, the proportion of patients
that recurs with a particular intervention scenario i can be
given as:
Sensitivityi  ½1  sðtÞ  RR þ ð1  Specificityi Þ
 ½1  sðtÞ:

Because we are treating recurrence as a binary event,
RR is defined as the risk of recurrence at 5 years with treatment divided by 5-year recurrence risk without treatment.
Our primary analyses assumed that the RR was constant
across risk groups, so that, for example, given a chemotherapy regimen associated with an RR of 0.9, a patient
who has a 50% probability of disease recurrence
without treatment would have a risk of 45% on chemotherapy, and patient who has a 10% baseline risk would
have a 9% risk.
For sensitivity analyses, we considered 3 scenarios in
which the treatment was most effective for patients at low
risk, average risk, and high risk. A patient’s risk was estimated by using the nomogram probability, which is justified because it has been demonstrated that the nomogram
is well calibrated.12 Figure 1 is an illustration of how RR
varied by absolute risk for each scenario. The mean RR
was kept constant between scenarios, such that the total
number of disease recurrences was identical regardless of
the presumed relation between absolute risk and RR.
The proportion of patients that would be treated
under each strategy is estimated by counting the proportion of patients in our dataset that meets each criterion.
Knowing the treatment and recurrence rates for each strategy does not necessarily identify the optimal approach.

Decision Analysis of Bladder Model/Vickers et al

Often, when comparing 2 strategies, 1 approach will be
associated with a lower rate of treatment but also with a
higher rate of disease recurrence. To calculate whether the
reduction in the number of patients receiving chemotherapy offsets the increase in recurrence rates, we need to consider the maximum number of patients a clinician would
consider treating to prevent 1 recurrence. This is known
as the ‘‘number-needed-to-treat threshold’’ (NNTT) and
is a clinical judgment that can vary from clinician to clinician and from patient to patient.18 The NNTT is reciprocal of the minimum, clinically significant difference, a
concept necessary to design and interpret randomized trials.19,20 NNTT is a measure of drug tolerability in which
an agent that is easy to take, inexpensive, and associated
with low toxicity would have a high NNTT; and a toxic,
inconvenient, or expensive drug would have a low NNTT.
Note that the NNTT is different from the usually reported
number needed to treat (NNT): NNT is calculated from
the results of a study and tells us how many patients would
need to be treated to prevent 1 event; NNTT is a clinical
consideration independent of the results of any study and
tells us how a physician weights the harms of treatment
against the benefits of avoiding an event. Then, we can
define ‘‘clinical net benefit’’16 as follows:
Clinical net benefit ¼ ðreduction in event rateÞ
 ðtreatment rate  NNTT Þ:

Because net benefit includes both treatments and
recurrences, the optimal treatment strategy is the 1 with
the highest net benefit, irrespective of the size of the difference between strategies. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 9.2 statistical software (StataCorp,
College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the 4462 patients in our sample
are summarized in Table 1. The median age at cystectomy
was 62 years (interquartile range, 51-70 years), and the
majority of patients were men (77%). Approximately half
were either lymph node positive or had disease classified
as pT3 (n ¼ 2466; 55%); 4081 patients (91%), 1835
patients (41%), and 365 patients (8%) had a 10%,

nomogram probability of 25% as eligibility for postoperative chemotherapy reduces the number of patients treated
by nearly 25% at the cost of a slight increase in disease recurrence rates; using a 10% nomogram probability
increases the number of patients treated by approximately
65%, but this is associated with a large reduction in rates
of disease recurrence. Table 3 shows the net benefit for
each cutoff level given a range of NNTT and RR values.
The strategy with the highest net benefit will have the optimal clinical results. When drugs are very effective (RR, 0.6
or 0.7) or tolerable (NNTT, 35 or 50), the highest net benefit is for a nomogram cutoff level of 10%. When drugs
are of more marginal benefit and poor tolerability (RR,
0.9; NNTT, 20), the nomogram cutoff of 70% is optimal.
For the remaining scenarios, a nomogram cutoff of 25%
provides the highest net benefit. The differences between
strategies are not trivial. For example, at an RR of 0.80
and an NNTT of 20, the use of a 25% threshold has a net
benefit 0.003 higher than the standard pathologic groups.
This is equivalent to a strategy that led to 3 fewer recurrences per 1000 patients without any change in the number of patients who received chemotherapy or to a strategy
associated with 60 fewer treatments per 1000 patients
without any increase in the rate of disease recurrence.
To explain these findings, Figure 2 provides an illustration of the distribution of predicted probabilities within
each pathologic grouping. A nomogram cutoff of 25%
includes all patients with lymph node-positive disease.
However, a little more than 25% of patients with pT3 or
pT4 disease or lymph node-negative disease are at low risk

We then repeated our analysis for all possible combinations of RR (0.50-0.99) and NNTT (1-250 patients)

and outliers are illustrated by dots. Nþ indicates lymph node

The results are provided in Figure 3. For example, Table 3
shows that, for an NNTT of 20 and an RR of 0.8, the
highest net benefit is obtained by treating only patients
with at least a 25% risk of disease recurrence; the point
corresponding to 0.8 on the x axis and 20 on the y axis in
Figure 3 is medium gray, indicating the 25% threshold as
the optimal strategy. When adjuvant therapy is highly
effective or tolerable, as expected, either all patients or all
patients except those with a very low risk (nomogram
probability, <10%) should be treated; when therapy is of
moderate effectiveness or tolerability, either no patients or
only those at the highest risk (nomogram probability
70%) should be treated. For the remaining patients, the
25% cutoff is optimal. It is important to note that for no
combination of effectiveness or tolerability is the highest
net benefit associated with the standard eligibility for
chemotherapy. In other words, the nomogram outperforms the standard guideline for every plausible scenario
of drug effect and tolerability: Whatever a clinician
believes about a particular drug, he or she should use a
nomogram cutoff to decide which patients to treat.
We excluded 2320 patients who were receiving
chemotherapy or radiotherapy or other, unknown treatments, including 19% (679 of 3551 patients) who had
low disease classification (pT2 and lymph node-negative
disease), 32% (1536 of 4875 patients) who had high disease classification (pT3 or lymph-node positive disease),
and 16% (105 of 638 patients) who had unknown stage.

patients (intervention does more harm than good). The specificity of the optimal strategy increases from top left to bottom right. Note that the conventional definition was inferior
to all other strategies for every combination of NNT threshold
and RR and, thus, has no shaded region on the illustrations.

Although a higher proportion of patients with high stage
were excluded, our cohort comprised the vast majority of
patients with both high and low pathologic stages. Accordingly, we see no reason to believe that treatment selection
would have an important impact on our findings.
Our primary analyses involved an assumption that
the RR reduction associated with treatment was constant
across risk groups. Therefore, we performed sensitivity
analyses to verify that our results were robust to this

assumption. Results of these sensitivity analyses are displayed in Table 4. Although it appears initially that conclusions regarding the optimal cutoff level sometimes depend
on our assumptions of how RR varies with absolute risk,
the assumption of constant RR analyses yielded good
results. Generally, there were only small differences in net
benefit noted between the optimal strategy under constant
RR and the optimal strategy in which the RR varied by
baseline risk. Most important, the strategy chosen under
the assumption of a constant RR was superior to standard
pathologic risk groups across all but 2 of the sensitivity
analyses that we conducted; and, in both of those analyses,
the advantage was trivial (1 or 3 recurrences per 10,000
patients). Thus, our conclusion that the nomogram
improves clinical outcomes holds true regardless of the
relation between absolute risk and RR reduction.
The nomogram was developed with the exclusion of
patients who had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy—patients who likely have the most unfavorable
5466

tumor characteristics. Consequently, the predictions from
the nomogram may underestimate the overall risk of
recurrence. Therefore, in a second sensitivity analysis, we
added a constant to the nomogram prediction for every
patient (varying the constant from 2% to 5%) and
repeated all analyses, and no results were changed.
In a third sensitivity analysis, we repeated all analyses
using only patients who had transitional cell carcinoma,
the predominant histology for bladder cancer in Europe
and North America (see Fig. 3). Although there were
some differences in results, our key finding was unaffected: One or another nomogram cutoff was superior to
the standard eligibility criteria for chemotherapy for every
combination of drug tolerability and effectiveness.
Our final sensitivity analysis accounted for the competing risk of death; that is, we defined the probability of
recurrence by using the cumulative incidence function
instead of the Kaplan-Meier estimate.21 The optimal
treatment strategy under the competing risk analysis was

the same as that under the primary analysis for all but 1
combination of NNTT and RR, as shown in Table 3.

DISCUSSION
Adjuvant chemotherapy after bladder cancer is subject to
some debate, in particular, data from randomized trials,
although positive,13,14 are limited by inadequate numbers
of patients. Nonetheless, adjuvant therapy often is given after radical cystectomy (it is recommended in standard
guidelines15), and pathologic stage is the most common criterion to determine which patients receive it. Our analyses
suggest that determining eligibility for adjuvant chemotherapy after radical cystectomy on the basis of a multivariate
model will yield superior clinical results compared with
determining eligibility on the basis of pathologic characteristics alone. In a typical comparison, use of the nomogram
would reduce the number of patients subjected to chemotherapy by 14% with only a small increase in disease recurrences (0.4%). This improvement in outcome is obtained
purely by changing a decision rule: there are no additional
tests, procedures, or treatments. The superior clinical performance of the nomogram appears to result from reclassification of an important proportion of patients: Some
patients with pT3 or pT4 disease would not be eligible for
chemotherapy on the basis of the nomogram because of the
absence of any other risk factor (such as a long time from
diagnosis to treatment); comparably, some patients with
<pT3 disease are eligible for chemotherapy according to
the nomogram, because they are defined as high risk for a
reason other than pathologic stage.
Although previous studies have demonstrated that
multivariate models improve predictive accuracy compared with staging systems,8-11 we believe that we are the
first to demonstrate that use of such models would have
beneficial effects with respect to a therapeutic decision.
This finding has important consequences for cancer care.
An enormous range of decisions concerning the care of
the cancer patient is based on risk, with patients thought
to be a higher risk subject to more intensive treatment or
monitoring. Currently, however, nearly all such decisions
are based on simple risk stratifications, such as stage. We
hypothesize that multivariate risk prediction models could
be used to replace many of the decisions currently made
on the basis of stage, including whether a patient receives
surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy; how aggressively
the patient is treated; the intensity of post-treatment folCancer

low-up; and eligibility for clinical trials. We have demonstrated that changing the criteria to make decisions has
important clinical consequences; therefore, we also
hypothesize that the use of such models would improve
cancer care either by decreasing the number of patients
subject to unnecessary treatment or by decreasing event
rates as a result of better identification of which patients
require intervention.
Multivariate models have 2 additional advantages
over crude risk stratifications based on criteria such as stage.
First, multivariate models allow for the individualization of
care. Patients may differ with respect to the relative value
they place on treatment toxicities and disease recurrence,
and a model allows patients to vary with respect to the
thresholds they use for treatment. Second, multivariate
models allow for the addition of prognostic markers when
and if it is demonstrated that they have benefit. In the case
of bladder cancer, for example, it has been suggested that
the status of markers such as cyclin E1, p53, p21, retinoblastoma protein, and p27 may distinguish more aggressive
tumors from less aggressive tumors22,23; similarly, genomic
analyses have indicated that certain patterns of gene expression may be associated with cancer outcome.24 If these
markers are validated, then it will remain unclear how they
could be incorporated into a staging system without an
unmanageable expansion of multiple categories (high
stage/lymph node-negative/low p53/low genomic risk;
high stage/lymph node-negative/high p53/low genomic
risk; and so on). Conversely, such markers easily can be
incorporated into multivariate models.
There are several possible limitations to our study.
First, the dataset was used to generate the predictive
model that was used to assess it. That said, we do not
believe that this resulted in statistical over fit on the
grounds that there was a very large number of events.
Indeed, we conducted some preliminary analyses to estimate statistical ‘‘optimism’’25 and observed that this was
close to zero (eg, using a cutoff probability of 25% and an
RR of 0.8, the optimism for the net benefit from the nomogram was 0.0001). It also is possible that patients who
are treated in the community differ systematically from
patients who are treated at academic centers, who contribute data to the nomogram. But even if this is true, it is not
clear that this would favor either the nomogram or the
standard criteria for chemotherapy. For example, if stage
is assessed poorly in a community setting or if lymph
5467

node removal is less extensive, then it would reduce the
predictive accuracy of the nomogram, but it also would
affect the predictive value of a decision rule based on stage
and lymph node status alone.
A clear limitation of this study, as discussed above, is
that, despite being a National Comprehensive Cancer
Network guideline standard of care, adjuvant therapy for
bladder cancer is not unequivocally considered to be of
benefit. However, it can be argued that the quality of evidence for adjuvant therapy is not directly relevant to our
findings unless one takes the position that adjuvant therapy does not and cannot possibly work for bladder cancer
and should never be subjected to a clinical trial. In the absence of such a position, a decision will have to be made
regarding which patients receive adjuvant therapy,
whether as a clinical decision rule or the as eligibility criteria for a trial. Our Figure 3 illustrates that, irrespective of
the characteristics of the adjuvant agent—whether its toxicity is high or low and whether it is of great or only moderate effectiveness—the predicted clinical results will be
superior if the nomogram rather than standard pathologic
criteria are used to determine which patients receive
treatment.
Although it may be desirable in principle, subjecting
a nomogram-based strategy for chemotherapy referral to
prospective experimental trial is of doubtful feasibility.
For example, imagine that we wanted to demonstrate that
a nomogram-based strategy would lead to a recurrence
rate similar to that achieved by a standard nomogram but
required that fewer patients receive chemotherapy. A noninferiority trial designed to test whether the nomogram
did not increase recurrence rates by >1% well may require
>25,000 patients.
This article is presented in the spirit of ‘‘proof of
principle.’’ We believe that we are the first to demonstrate
clearly that use of a prediction model to inform decisions
regarding chemotherapy would improve clinical outcome.
That said, there are several steps that would need to be
taken before the prediction model could be used in the
clinic. First, we believe that the prediction model itself
should be updated. The original bladder nomogram was
developed for general use rather than for the specific purpose of chemotherapy referral. Consequently, the dataset
that was used to develop the nomogram included patients
who would not be considered for adjuvant chemotherapy,
such as those of advanced age or those diagnosed with
5468

squamous cell carcinoma. Second, in this report, we chose
illustrative cutoff levels for the nomogram (10%, 25%,
and 70%). The alternative would be to choose optimal
cutoff levels for each of several scenarios of drug effectiveness and tolerability. Third, any statistical model would
have to be implemented in a user-friendly format, perhaps
in a web version similar to Adjuvantonline.7
In the current study, we have demonstrated that referring patients to chemotherapy on the basis of a multivariate model is likely to lead to better patient outcomes
than the use of pathologic groups. Given the importance
of this finding—that we can improve outcome merely by
changing the basis on which we make decisions—we recommend research on other multivariate prediction models to determine their clinical effects.
