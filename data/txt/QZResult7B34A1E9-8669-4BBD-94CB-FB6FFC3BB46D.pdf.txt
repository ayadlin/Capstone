Summary

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cell cycle checkpoints are implemented to safeguard genome, avoiding the accumulation of
genetic errors1–2. Checkpoint loss results in genomic instability and contributes to the
evolution of cancer. Among G1-, S-, G2- and M-phase checkpoints, genetic studies indicate
the essence of an intact S phase checkpoint in maintaining genome integrity3–4. Although
the basic framework of S phase checkpoint in higher eukaryotes has been outlined, the
mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Human chromosome 11 band q23 translocations
disrupting the MLL/HRX/ALL-1 gene lead to poor prognostic leukemias5–9. Here we assign
MLL as a novel effector in the mammalian S phase checkpoint network and identify
checkpoint dysfunction as an underlying mechanism of MLL leukemias. MLL is
phosphorylated at serine 516 by ATR in response to genotoxic stress in S phase, which
disrupts its interaction with and thereby degradation by the SCFSkp2 E3 ligase, leading to its
accumulation. Stabilized MLL protein accumulates on chromatin, methylates histone H3K4
at late replication origins, and inhibits the loading of CDC45 to delay DNA replication.
Cells deficient in MLL exhibited radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS) and chromatid-type
genomic abnormalities, indicative of S phase checkpoint dysfunction. Reconstitution of
MLL−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with wild-type but not S516A or ΔSET
mutant MLL rescues the S phase checkpoint defects. Moreover, murine myeloid progenitor
cells (MPCs) carrying an MLL-CBP knock-in allele that mimics human t(11;16) leukemia
exhibit a severe RDS phenotype. MLL-fusions function as dominant negative mutants that
abrogate the ATR-mediated phosphorylation/stabilization of wild-type MLL upon DNA

damage and thus compromise the S phase checkpoint. Altogether, our study identifies MLL
as a key constituent of the mammalian DNA damage response pathway and deregulation of
the S phase checkpoint incurred by MLL translocations likely contributes to the
pathogenesis of human MLL leukemias.
Leukemogenic MLL translocations fuse the common MLL N-terminal 1,400 aa in frame
with more than 60 partners8. The MLL gene encodes a 500 kD precursor MLL500 which is
processed by Taspase110 to generate mature, heterodimerized MLLN320/C180. MLL
participates in embryogenesis, cell fate, cell cycle and stem cell function7,11–14, in part by
methylating histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) through its C-terminal SET domain15. Although
the importance of HOX gene deregulation in the pathogenesis of MLL leukemias has been
extensively investigated5–8, physiological MLL-fusion knock-in mouse models indicate that
HOX gene aberrations alone are insufficient to initiate MLL leukemias7,16.

MLL participates in the cell cycle control12,17–19 and exhibits a biphasic expression with
peaks at G1/S and G2/M transitions12. This unique, two peaks are conferred by proteasomemediated degradation–SCFSkp2 and APCCdc20 degrade MLL at S and M phases,
respectively12. Why MLL needs to be degraded in S and M phases is unclear. The
observation that over-expression of MLL impedes S phase progression12 raises a testable
thesis that MLL may accumulate in S phase upon DNA damage to delay DNA replication
for repair. Indeed, tested DNA perturbation agents, including aphidocolin, hydroxyurea
(HU), ultraviolet light (UV), etoposide, and γ-ionizing irradiation (γ-IR), induced the MLL
protein expression, (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). The MLL protein was induced
upon DNA damage in S but not G1 or M phases through a transcription-independent
mechanism (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1c).

The S phase checkpoint senses DNA damage, activates ATM/ATR, inhibits the firing of late
replication origins, and enlists repair machineries. “Chromatid-type” genomic errors,
accrued during S phase, include quadriradials, triradials, and chromatid gaps and breaks20.
Metaphase spread analysis demonstrated a higher incidence of chromatid-type errors in
mitomycin C treated MLL−/− than wild-type cells (Fig. 1c). Cells with compromised S phase
checkpoints exhibit radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS)3. Knockdown of MLL in 293T
cells or genetic deletion of MLL in MEFs resulted in RDS (Fig. 1d), confirming a critical
role of wild-type MLL in the mammalian S phase checkpoint. To explore whether MLLfusions incur S phase checkpoint defects, we generated myeloid precursor cells (MPCs)
from MLL+/ex7(stop)CBP mice that carry a knock-in inducible MLLex7-CBP allele
(Supplementary Fig. 2)21. MLL+/ex7(stop)CBP MPCs retained only one copy of wild-type
MLL and consequently exhibited a partial RDS phenotype (Fig. 1e). Remarkably, a severe
RDS phenotype was observed in MLL+/ex7-CBP MPCs (Fig. 1e). These data suggest that
MLL-CBP functions as a dominant negative mutant that actively compromises the S phase
checkpoint, contributing to the acquisition of additional chromosomal translocations
observed in MLL+/ex7-CBP leukemias21. Furthermore, expression of MLL-AF4 or MLL-AF9
in Jurkat T cells resulted in an RDS phenotype despite the presence of two wild-type MLL
alleles (Supplementary Fig. 3). Consistently, expression of MLL-ENL in progenitor cells
increased chromosomal abnormalities upon etoposide treatment22.

MLL is normally degraded in S phase by SCFSkp2 which directly binds to the N-terminal
1,400 aa of MLL12. It is conceivable that signal transduction triggered by DNA damage
disrupts the MLL-Skp2 interaction and thereby induces MLL, which was indeed observed
(Fig. 2a). As the DNA damage response network relays signals mainly through
phosphorylation, we examined whether inhibition of proximal kinases including ATM, ATR
and DNA-PKcs prohibited the DNA damage-induced MLL accumulation. LY294002 and
Wortmannin abolished the MLL accumulation upon DNA damage (Fig. 2b). To specify key
kinase(s) required for such signaling, we employed MEFs with deletion of ATM, ATR or
DNA-PKcs23–24. Deficiency in ATR greatly reduced the accumulation of MLL upon DNA
damage (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig.4), identifying ATR as the principal kinase for the
MLL induction.

As DNA damage signals disrupt the MLL-Skp2 interaction, ATR might directly or
indirectly phosphorylate MLL and/or Skp2, leading to their dissociation. Bioinformatics
analysis (scansite.mit.edu) identified a candidate ATM/ATR site at conserved serine 516
(LPISQSP) of MLL (Fig. 3a). In contrast to the disrupted interaction between wild-type
MLL and Skp2 upon HU treatment, a comparable interaction was detected between
MLL(S516A) and Skp2 irrespective of DNA insults (Fig. 3b), suggesting that S516
phosphorylation dissociates MLL from Skp2. The S516 of MLL became phosphorylated
after HU treatment (Fig. 3b), correlating with diminished MLL-Skp2 interaction. To assess
if ATR can directly phosphorylate MLL, we performed in vitro kinase assays using affinitypurified ATR and recombinant MLL proteins. As ATR needs to be fully activated by
TopBP1 or Claspin25, purified ATR only weakly phosphorylated wild-type but not S516A
MLL protein (Fig. 3c). Once activated by TopBP1, ATR effectively phosphorylated MLL,
detected by both anti-phospho-ATM/ATR substrate and anti-phospho-MLL(S516)
antibodies (Fig. 3c). To assess the functional significance of S516 phosphorylation, MLL−/−
MEFs reconstituted with wild-type or S516A human MLL (Supplementary Fig. 5) were
subjected to RDS and metasphase spread assays (Fig. 3d, e). Unlike wild-type MLL, S516A
MLL failed to fully rescue the RDS defects and chromatid-type errors of MLL−/− MEFs
(Fig. 3d, e). Although S516A MLL is defective in the S phase checkpoint, its interaction
with Menin and WDR5 and targeting to the promoters of HoxA9 and Meis1 remain intact as
wild-type MLL (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To investigate the mechanism(s) by which MLL engages S phase checkpoint, we determined
if MLL deficiency affects the upstream signal transduction upon DNA damage. Like wildtype MEFs, MLL−/− cells were competent in the formation of γH2AX foci (Supplementary
Fig. 7a). The autophosphorylation of ATM, the S139 phosphorylation of H2AX, the ATMmediated activating phosphorylation of Chk2, and the ATR-mediated activating
phosphorylation of Chk1 were not affected by the MLL deficiency (Supplementary Fig. 7b,
c). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of SMC1 by ATM/ATR, the degradation of CDC25A
signaled by Chk kinases, and the Y15 phosphorylation of CDK2 were also not altered in
MLL deficient cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d).
The key effector step at the initiation of DNA replication is the loading of CDC45 onto the
pre-replication complex (pre-RC) which consists of ORC and the MCM2-7 complex26. The
chromatin association of CDC45 correlates well with DNA synthesis, and thus marks the

firing of replication origins26. Supporting the role of MLL in S phase checkpoint, an
aberrant chromatin association of CDC45 was observed in MLL deficient cells upon DNA
insults, whereas the chromatin association of MCM2 was not altered (Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 8). The S phase checkpoint commenced at ATM/ATR ultimately
inhibits CDC45 loading, in part through inactivating CDK2 and DDK3,3,27–28, which was
not affected by the MLL deficiency (Supplementary Figs. 7d and 9). Furthermore, the MLLmediated inhibition of chromatin association of CDC45 was transcription-independent
(Supplementary Fig. 10). ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays on the β-globin
origin, a well characterized late replication origin in 293T cells29, demonstrated that MLL
accumulated and methylated H3K4 at the β-globin origin upon DNA damage, resulting in a
decreased CDC45 occupancy (Fig. 4b). These data suggest that the histone methyl
transferase (HMT) activity of MLL may be required for the execution of S phase
checkpoint, which is corroborated by the inability of ΔSET MLL mutant to fully correct the
RDS defects and chromatid-type errors of MLL−/− MEFs (Fig. 3d, e). In fact, histone H3
directly interacted with CDC45 and this interaction was greatly compromised when H3K4
was trimethylated (Fig. 4c, d). Data presented thus far support a model in which stabilized
MLL accumulates on chromatin to methylate H3K4 at late replication origins upon S phase
checkpoint activation, which inhibits CDC45 loading and thereby delays DNA replication
(Fig. 4h). Although MLL likely methylates H3K4 at all late replication origins upon DNA
damage, genome-wide studies are required to conclude such a mechanism.

We next investigated how MLL-fusions function as dominant negative mutants in the S
phase checkpoint. Of note, all MLL-fusions have lost their C-terminal SET domain (Fig. 3a)
and tested MLL-fusions were resistant to the Skp2-mediated degradation due to impaired
interaction12. Accordingly, MLL-AF4 and MLL-AF9 were not further stabilized upon DNA
damage despite the increased S516 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 11). Chromatin
association assays revealed an aberrant loading of CDC45 upon DNA damage in Jurkat T
cells that stably express MLL-AF4 or MLL-AF9 (Fig. 4e). While MLL-AF4 and MLL-AF9
stably bound to chromatin, wild-type MLL (MLLC180) failed to accumulate on chromatin in
the presence of MLL-Fusions (Fig. 4e). Consequently, ChIP assays demonstrated a stable
association of FLAG-MLL-fusions, an ablated accumulation of wild-type MLL (MLLC180),
a failed induction of H3K4me3, and an aberrant loading of CDC45 on the late replication
origin upon genotoxic stress (Fig. 4f). Altogether, these data suggest that MLL-fusions
function as dominant negative mutants by preventing the stabilization of wild-type MLL
upon DNA insults. As the ATR-mediated phosphorylation and dissociation of wild-type
MLL from Skp2 constitutes the initiating step of MLL-mediated S phase checkpoint
response, MLL-fusions might prevent the stabilization of wild-type MLL upon DNA
damage by abrogating the S516 phosphorylation of wild-type MLL and thus preserving the
interaction between wild-type MLL and Skp2. Since ATR associates with chromatin and
becomes active upon DNA insults25, the pre-occupancy of MLL-fusions on chromatin
would prohibit the access of wild-type MLL to the activated ATR. Co-expression of MLLAF9 with wild-type MLL abrogated the S516 phosphorylation of wild-type MLL but not
MLL-AF9 upon DNA insults, leading to a constitutive interaction/degradation of wild-type
MLL by Skp2 (Fig. 4g). In summary, MLL-fusions stably associate with chromatin and
prevent the stabilization/targeting of wild-type MLL to the late replication origin upon DNA

damage, which abolish the trimethylation of H3K4 and result in an aberrant loading of
CDC45 and dysfunction of S phase checkpoints (Fig. 4e–h and Supplementary Fig. 12). The
discovery of MLL in executing S phase checkpoint provides new mechanistic insights
concerning not only normal cell biology but also the pathology underlying MLL leukemias.

Generation of myeloid precursor cells (MPCs)

Author Manuscript

The MLL-CBP knock-in allele (MLLex7-CBP) was designed to recapitulate human t(11;16)
MLL-CBP myeloid leukemias21. The MLLex7(stop)CBP allele was engineered by inserting a
floxed “stop cassette” proximal to the knock-in CBP fusion that could be removed upon the
expression of cre recombinase, generating the MLLex7-CBP allele (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
The generation of MPCs has been described20. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation
and bone marrow was harvested from 6 MLL+/ex7(stop)CBPand 6 age-, sex-matched, wildtype littermate mice (Supplementary Fig. 2)21. MPCs were isolated by lineage depletion
(Lin: CD3, Gr-1, B220, ter119) followed by positive selection of Sca-1+ cells using
magnetic beads (Miltenyi). These cells were co-cultured with irradiated (30 Gy) NIH 3T3
hph-HOX11 retrovirus producer cells in infection medium (IMDM, 20% FBS, 100 U/ml
penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 20 ng/ml stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml
GMCSF, and 2 ng/ml GCSF) for 3 days. Cells grew in suspension were expanded in IMDM
supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, and 10%
WEHI conditioned medium as the source of IL-3. To generate MLL+/ex7-CBP MPCs,
MLL+/ex7(stop)CBP MPCs were first retrovirally transduced with creERT2 by spin inoculation,
selected with puromycin, and then treated with 0.5 µM 4-OHT for 2 days to delete the “stop
cassette”, which was then confirmed by genomic PCR as described21.
Reconstitute MLL−/− MEFs using the Flp-In system

Author Manuscript

MLL−/− MEFs were engineered to carry one FRT cassette (Supplementary Fig. 5a). These
FRT+;MLL−/− MEFs were co-transfected with pcDNA-FRT vectors expressing wild-type,
S516A, or ΔSET human MLL plus pOG44 which encodes the Flp recombinase and
subjected to hygromycin B selection. Recombination was verified by genomic DNA PCR
and the protein expression was determined by Western blot analyses.
Generate Jurkat MLL-AF4 and Jurkat MLL-AF9 cells using the Flp-In system
The Flp-In™ Jurkat cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with pcDNA-FRT MLL-AF4 or

Radio-resistant DNA synthesis assays

Author Manuscript

The procedures of RDS have been described35. In brief, cells were first labeled with 20
nCi/ml 14C-thymidine for 24 h to monitor the rate of proliferation of individual cell lines
under normal growth condition. These cells were then irradiated with indicated dose of γ-IR.
Forty-five minutes post-IR, culture medium was replaced with 2.5 µCi/ml 3H-thymidine
containing medium. Thirty minutes after 3H-thymidine labeling, cells were then lysed in
0.25 M NaOH. The radioactivity was measured using an LS 6500 Liquid Scintillation
Counter and the [3H]/[14C] ratio was calculated as described35.
shRNA-mediated knockdown, qRT–PCR, and immunofluorescence assays

Author Manuscript

Both shRNA-mediated knockdown and qRT-PCR of MLL have been described12. MEFs
grown on LabTek II chamber slides (Nunc) were treated with 25 µM etoposide for 15
minutes, washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min,
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 60
min. Fixed cells were then incubated with anti-γH2AX (Abcam) antibody for 1 hour,
washed twice with PBS, and incubated with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular
Probes) antibody for an additional 30 minutes. Microscopy was performed using an
Olympus IX51 microscope attached to a Spotcam (Diagnostic). Images were captured and
analyzed by SPOTcam program as described36.
Metaphase spread, chromatin association, and ChIP assays

Author Manuscript

Metaphase spread assays have been described37. In brief, MEFs of the indicated genotypes
were treated with 20 ng/ml mitomycin C for 36 hours before subjected to metaphase spread
analysis. Chromatin-enriched fractions were purified as described38. ChIP assays were
performed using the Magna ChIP A Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacture’s protocol.
One µg of pre-immune rabbit IgG, anti-CDC45, or anti-MLLC180 antibody was utilized for
each ChIP reaction. Precipitated DNA was amplified using β-globin origin, HoxA9 and
Meis1 specific primers29,17 and the PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis (2%) and visualized with ethidium bromide under UV.
In vitro kinase assays

Author Manuscript

293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-ATR or pFLAG-TopBP1 using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours post transfection, cells were treated
with 20 µM of etoposide for 1 hour and then lysed in RIPA buffer. FLAG-tagged protein
was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) and eluted with 3×FLAG
peptide. His-tagged wild-type and S516A MLL aa 466–565 fragments were purified using
TALON beads (Clontech) and eluted with Imidazole according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. In vitro kinase assays were performed by incubating 0.5 µg of recombinant MLL
fragments with purified ATR plus/minus TopBP1 in kinase buffer that contains 10 µM ATP
at 30°C for 30 minutes. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylation was
visualized by indicated phospho-specific antibodies.

sonicated, and precleared for 1 hour with streptavidin beads (GE Healthcare). Individual
biotin conjugated histone H3 tails (aa 1–21, 2µg) (Millipore) were incubated with either
nuclear extracts or 1µg of recombinant GST-CDC45 in 300 µl of binding buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, NaCl 150 mM, Triton X-100 0.1%), precipitated using streptavidin beads,
resolved in NuPAGE, and subjected to Western or Coomassie blue stain analyses.
BrUTP incorporation assays

Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 10 mM BrUTP (Sigma) and incubated for 15 min at
room temperature before transfection. 293T cells were washed twice with OPTI-MEM
(Invitrogen), and 100 µl of the transfection mix was added to each well of a chamber slide.
After incubation for 2 hours, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and used for
immunostaining with BrdU antibody (clone Bu-33 Sigma).
