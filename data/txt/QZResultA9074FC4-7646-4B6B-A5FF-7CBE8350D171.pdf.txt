Abstract

Author Manuscript

Although p53–mediated cell–cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis serve as critical barriers to
cancer development, emerging evidence suggests that the metabolic activities of p53 are also
important. Here we show that p53 inhibits cystine uptake and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a non–
apoptotic form of cell death, by repressing expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the
cystine/glutamate antiporter. Notably, p533KR, an acetylation–defective mutant that fails to induce
cell–cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, fully retains the ability to regulate SLC7A11
expression and induce ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)–induced stress. Analysis of
mutant mice shows that these non–canonical p53 activities contribute to embryonic development
and the lethality associated with loss of Mdm2. Moreover, SLC7A11 is highly expressed in human
tumours, and its overexpression inhibits ROS–induced ferroptosis and abrogates p533KR–mediated
tumour growth suppression in xenograft models. Our findings uncover a new mode of tumour
suppression based on p53 regulation of cystine metabolism, ROS responses and ferroptosis.
Inactivation of the p53 tumour suppression pathway is a pivotal event in the formation of
most human cancers1–5. Traditionally, the tumour suppression activity of p53 was thought to

reflect its ability to elicit cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and/or senescence in response to
cellular stress. However, recent studies suggest that other unconventional activities of p53
are also crucial for its tumour suppressor function4–8. The p53 protein achieves its diverse
cellular outcomes by serving as a DNA-binding transcription factor that selectively
modulates the expression of certain p53 transcriptional target genes. Stress-induced
activation of p53 protein is primarily achieved by post-translational modifications9, and our
recent studies of mice expressing acetylation-defective p53 mutants revealed that acetylation
differentially regulates p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence10. Notably,
the mutant p533KR polypeptide, while defective for the three conventional p53 functions,
still retains its tumour suppression function and the ability to modulate the expression of
metabolic targets10, suggesting that p53-mediated metabolic regulation is critically involved
in suppressing tumour formation in vivo.

Identification of SLC7A11 as a p53 target

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To elucidate the precise effects of p53-mediated metabolic regulation, we sought to identify
novel p53 target genes by generating a tetracycline-controlled (tet-on) p53-inducible cell
line for microarray analysis. Array data were examined with Partek software and genes that
are differentially expressed between induced and non-induced cells were identified
(Extended Data Table 1). SLC7A11, which encodes a component of the cystine/glutamate
antiporter11–13, was identified as a novel p53 target gene. While there was no obvious effect
of tetracycline treatment on SLC7A11 expression in the parental H1299 cells, progressive
repression of SLC7A11 mRNA expression was observed in the tet-on p53-inducible line
(Extended Data Fig. 1a) and western blot analysis revealed that p53 activation severely
reduced SLC7A11 protein levels (Fig. 1a). The 5′ flanking region of the human SLC7A11
gene at chromosome 4q28-31 (ref. 13) contains one site that matches the consensus p53binding sequence (Fig. 1b), and a p53–DNA complex was readily identified by
electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) upon incubation of highly purified
recombinant full-length human wild-type p53 with a radio-labelled oligonucleotide probe
containing this site (Fig. 1c). Moreover, this p53–DNA complex was super-shifted in the
presence of a p53-specific antibody and was markedly diminished by competition with the
unlabelled probe. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of human
osteosarcoma U2OS cells (which express wild-type p53) revealed that endogenous p53
polypeptides occupy the promoter region of the SLC7A11 gene (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the
protein levels of SLC7A11 were markedly decreased when p53 is activated by nutlin-3
treatment14 or upon DNA damage (Fig.1e and Extended Data Fig. 1b). In contrast,
SLC7A11 downregulation was completely abrogated under p53-knockdown conditions (Fig.
1e). Similar results were also observed in other human cancer cell lines expressing wild-type
p53 (H460 and MCF-7), whereas no apparent effects were detected in p53-null cells (H1299
and SAOS-2) (Extended Data Fig. 1c–e). Together, these data indicate that the SLC7A11
gene is a target of p53-mediated transcriptional repression.

Regulation of SLC7A11 expression by p533KR
Our previous study showed that p533KR retains the ability to regulate metabolic targets10. To
test the role of p533KR in modulating SLC7A11 expression, we established a tet-on H1299

cell line in which p533KR expression can be induced by tetracycline. Consistent with our
previous study10, p533KR was able to activate expression of TIGAR and MDM2, but not p21
(also known as CDKN1A) or PUMA (also known as BBC3). Notably, SLC7A11 levels
were drastically reduced at various time points after p533KR induction (Fig. 2a). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that the p533KR protein is able to bind the
promoter of the SLC7A11 gene (Fig. 2b). To corroborate this finding under more
physiological settings, we examined the levels of SLC7A11 transcripts in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from p53+/+, p533KR/3KR and p53−/− mice. Quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR) analysis revealed that SLC7A11
expression is markedly increased (∼4 fold) in p53−/− cells relative to wild-type MEFs (Fig.
2c and Extended Data Fig. 1f). However, SLC7A11 transcript levels remain low in
p533KR/3KR cells, suggesting that p533KR can inhibit SLC7A11 expression in a manner
similar to wild-type p53. Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that mouse p53 was recruited to
the murine Slc7a11 promoter region with the primers corresponding to the RE3 site in both
wild-type and p533KR MEFs but not in p53-null MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 1g, h). These
data demonstrate that the acetylation-defective mutant p533KR retains its ability to regulate
SLC7A11 expression in vivo.

Regulation of cystine uptake and ferroptosis

Author Manuscript

SLC7A11 is a key component of a plasma membrane transporter (the
system) that
+
mediates Na -independent cellular uptake of extracellular cystine in exchange for
intracellular glutamate11–13. To understand the functional consequences of p53-mediated
repression of SLC7A11 expression, we first examined the effect of p53 activation on
cellular uptake of L-[14C]-cystine. Indeed, the cystine uptake levels of tet-on p533KRinducible cells were reduced upon treatment with tetracycline (Fig. 2d). To investigate this
effect in a more physiological setting, we also examined p53+/+, p533KR/3KR and p53−/−
MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2e, cystine uptake was increased in p53−/− MEFs to levels about
60% higher than those of p53+/+ MEFs, validating that loss of p53 promotes cellular uptake
of cystine. Nevertheless, we failed to detect any increase of cystine uptake in p533KR/3KR
MEF cells, suggesting that p533KR retains the ability to suppress cystine uptake in vivo.

Author Manuscript

Notably, recent studies showed that SLC7A11 expression is also critical for ferroptosis, an
iron-dependent non-apoptotic cell death involving metabolic dysfunction15. To this end, we
examined whether p53 influences cellular sensitivity to ferroptosis by treating early passage
MEFs with erastin, a ferroptosis inducer. Although erastin induced high levels of cell death
(>48%) in both p53+/+ and p533KR/3KR MEFs, only low levels (∼20%) were observed in
p53-null cells (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Moreover, upon kinetic analysis, cell
death was readily detected in both p53+/+ and p533KR/3KR MEFs as early as 6 h after
treatment (Fig. 3b). Although a small fraction of cell death was also detected in p53-null
cells, differential effects on p53-null cells versus p53+/+ or p533KR/3KR MEFs are very
obvious at different time points upon exposure to different concentrations of erastin (Fig. 3b
and Extended Data Fig. 2b). By transmission electron microscopy of erastin-treated cells, we
observed shrunken mitochondria with increased membrane density but no obvious DNA
fragmentation (III and IV, Fig. 3c), a characteristic morphologic feature of apoptotic cells
upon TNF-α treatment (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Western blot analysis revealed that erastinNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 June 04.

induced cell death also failed to induce PARP1 cleavage and caspase 3 activation and the
lack of DNA fragmentation in ferroptosis was confirmed using TUNEL assay (Extended
Data Fig. 2d–f).

Author Manuscript

To confirm the mode of erastin-induced cell death, we treated cells with ferrostatin-1
(ferr-1), a specific inhibitor of ferroptosis15. Notably, ferr-1 completely rescued cell death in
both p53+/+ and p533KR/3KR MEFs (Fig. 3d). In contrast, inhibitors of other forms of cell
death, including autophagy (3-methylademine), apoptosis (Z-VAD-FMK) and necroptosis
(necrostatin-1), failed to suppress erastin-induced cell death (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig.
2g) despite their abilities to inhibit autophagy, necroptosis and apoptosis, respectively, in the
same MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 3a–e). Moreover, several additional inhibitors of
ferroptosis15 also proved to be effective in blocking p53-mediated ferroptosis of p533KR/3KR
MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Together, these data demonstrate that p533KR retains the
capacity to regulate cellular uptake of cystine and promote ferroptosis.

SLC7A11 in ferroptosis and tumour suppression

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that SLC7A11 overexpression is observed in several forms of
human cancer16–18. Upon analysis of 20 pairs of human tumours versus adjacent normal
tissues, we observed SLC7A11 over-expression in about 70% of human cancer specimens
(8/10 colon tumour samples, 3/5 liver tumour samples, and 3/5 kidney tumour samples)
(Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). To further evaluate its role in tumorigenesis, we performed
immunofluorescence staining assays for SLC7A11 on these tissue sections by using
confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4a, both the membrane marker (ATP1A1) (green)
and SLC7A11 (red) were localized predominantly on the plasma membrane. More
importantly, although the levels of ATP1A1 (green) were similar in normal and cancerous
tissues, the SLC7A11 levels (red) were markedly higher in malignant cells compared to the
adjacent normal cells (also see Extended Data Fig. 4d). Although SLC7A11 levels are
elevated in all p53-mutated tumours, SLC7A11 upregulation also occurs in tumours
expressing wild-type p53 (Extended Data Fig. 4e), suggesting that other factors may also
influence SLC7A11 expression in human cancers.

Author Manuscript

To explore the roles of p53-mediated SLC7A11 and ferroptosis in human cancer cells, we
first examined the effects of erastin on tet-on p533KR-inducible H1299 cells. As expected,
these cells are very resistant to erastin-mediated ferroptosis in the absence of p533KR
induction (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 5a); conversely, high levels of cell death (>80%)
were observed upon tetracycline induction of p533KR in the presence of erastin. Again, the
ferroptosis activity induced by p533KR was inhibited in the presence of ferr-1 (Extended
Data Fig. 5b). Notably, SLC7A11 overexpression rescued these cells from p533KRdependent ferroptosis (Fig. 4b) and also abrogated p533KR-mediated reduction in colony
formation (Extended Data Fig. 5c–e). These data indicate that SLC7A11 is overexpressed in
human tumour samples and that ectopic SLC7A11 expression can suppress ferroptosis
induced by p533KR in human cancer cells.
To validate the role of p53-mediated effects on SLC7A11 expression in modulating tumour
suppression activity independent of cell growth arrest, apoptosis and senescence, we tested

whether SLC7A11 overexpression affects tumour growth suppression induced by p533KR in
xenograft tumour models. Upon p533KR expression induced by tetracycline (Fig. 4c), the
growth of p53-null H1299 cells was dramatically reduced (Fig. 4d, III versus I) in xenograft
tumour growth assays; however, the tumour suppression effects of p533KR were largely
abrogated in the presence of SLC7A11 overexpression (Fig. 4d, IV versus III, also see Fig.
4e). These data demonstrate that SLC7A11 expression is crucial for the tumour growth
suppression activity induced by p533KR.

Metabolic regulation by p53 in embryonic development

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Several studies implicate that the canonical activities of p53 in apoptosis, cell growth arrest
and senescence are the primary cause of the lethality observed in p53+/+Mdm2−/− mouse
embryos, which die at days E3.5–E5.5 of development19–24. To evaluate whether noncanonical activities of p53 contribute to this phenotype, p533KR/3KRMdm2+/− mice were
intercrossed and their progenies genotyped. Given that the p533KR mutant fails to induce
p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence10, we were surprised to find a
complete absence of p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− pups in the progeny of these intercrosses
(Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Therefore, embryos obtained from timed intercrosses of
p533KR/3KRMdm2+/− mice were examined. By day E7.5, p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos
displayed dramatically elevated p53 staining but largely normal developmental structures
(Fig. 5a), indicating that the p533KRmutation elicits a substantial rescue of embryonic
development. As expected, despite high p533KR expression, p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos
did not exhibit increasing levels of apoptosis as shown by absence of cleaved caspase-3
staining (Fig. 5a) and negative TUNEL signals (Extended Data Fig. 6c, d). The levels for
Ki67 and BrdU staining also indicated that there is no cell growth inhibition in
p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Further analysis
confirmed the high levels of p533KR protein, absence of cleaved caspase-3, and lack of
induction of p21 or PUMA in p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f).
Moreover, we failed to detect any cells staining positive for senescence-associated βgalactosidase activity in p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos (Extended Data Fig. 6g–i),
suggesting an absence of senescent cells in those embryos.

Nevertheless, Slc7a11 mRNA expression was suppressed in p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos
(Fig. 5b), and by day E11.5 the developmental abnormalities of p533KR/3KRMdm2−/−
embryos became very obvious (Extended Data Fig. 7a). To explore whether p53-mediated
ferroptosis contributes to the developmental defects of p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos, we
injected the ferroptosis inhibitor ferr-1 into the peritoneal cavity at day E5.5 and collected
embryos at day E14.5. As shown in Fig. 5c, ferr-1-treated p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos
showed clear organogenesis such as eye formation and limb differentiation at day E14.5 (II),
at a time when untreated p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos had been largely decimated (I, also
see Extended Data Fig. 7b). The body sizes (from head to tail) of recovered
p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos were also significantly larger and the structure of the eyes was
markedly improved upon ferr-1 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7c, d). A recent study
identified upregulation of PTGS2 as a potential molecular marker of ferroptosis25. As shown
in Fig. 5d, Ptgs2 was indeed significantly upregulated in p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos;
conversely, Ptgs2 levels were not affected in p53−/−Mdm2−/− embryos, suggesting that

Ptgs2 upregulation in p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos is p53-dependent. Taken together, these
data indicate that p53-mediated effects on metabolic regulation and ferroptotic cell death
contribute critically to the embryonic developmental defects observed in
p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− embryos.

p53–mediated ferroptosis in ROS responses

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the regulation of ferroptosis in a more physiological setting, we examined
whether p533KR-mediated ferroptotic cell death is involved in ROS stress responses. The
method for ROS treatment has been described previously26,27. As shown in Fig. 6a, no
obvious cell death was observed upon either p533KR induction or ROS treatment alone.
Notably, however, the combination of p533KR induction and ROS treatment induced
massive cell death that was specifically inhibited by ferr-1 (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig.
8a) or by overexpression of SLC7A11 (Fig. 6b). These data indicate that activation of
p533KR leads to ferroptotic cell death in the presence of ROS stress, independent of cellcycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis.

Author Manuscript

Recent studies indicate that wild-type p53 proteins can be activated in human tumours by
nutlin-3 (ref 14). In most human cancer cells, nutlin-3-mediated p53 activation induces
reversible cell-cycle arrest but not cell death28,29, which may limit its efficacy in cancer
treatment. Therefore, we examined whether Mdm2 inhibition can modulate p53-mediated
ferroptos is in human cancer cells. As expected, nutlin-3 treatment of U2OS cells induced
high levels of p53 expression without eliciting cell death whereas the treatment of ROS
alone, which did not induce strong p53 activation, also failed to elicit a cell death response
(Fig.6c and Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). However, massive cell death was observed upon
combination treatment with both nutlin and ROS (Fig. 6c). The cell death response is p53dependent since it was abrogated upon knockdown of endogenous p53 (Fig. 6c and
Extended Data Fig. 8c), and the cell death was again rescued by the ferroptosis inhibitor
ferr-1 (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Interestingly, although high levels of cell death were also
induced in U2OS cells by DNA-damaging agents such as etoposide and doxorubicin, DNAdamage-induced cell death could not be suppressed by ferr-1 treatment (Extended Data Fig.
8e, f), suggesting that p53-mediated ferroptosisis specifically induced by ROS but not by
DNA damage.

Author Manuscript

Finally, to evaluate SLC7A11 regulation of ferroptosis under more physiological conditions,
we generated BAC transgenic mice overexpressing SLC7A11 (Slc7a11 bacterial artificial
chromosome, Slc7a11-BAC) (Extended Data Fig. 9). Although the phenotypes of Slc7a11BAC mice need further analysis, we derived MEFs from both Slc7a11-BAC mice and their
control littermates. As shown in Fig. 6d, SLC7A11 protein levels were elevated
approximately fivefold higher in Slc7a11-BACMEFs relative to the control MEFs. Notably,
treatment with either ROS or erastin elicited high levels of ferroptosis in wild-type MEFs
but ferroptotic cell death was largely abrogated in Slc7a11-BAC MEFs (Fig. 6e). Together,
these data indicate that p53-mediated ferroptosis is specifically induced by ROS and that the
levels of SLC7A11 are critical for p53-mediated ferroptotic responses.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Although it is commonly accepted that p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and
senescence all serve as major mechanisms of tumour suppression, accumulating evidence
indicates that other activities of p53, such as metabolic regulation, are also critical for
tumour suppression10. While a number of metabolic targets of p53 such as TIGAR, GLS2
and SCO2 have been identified30–37, it remains unclear how the metabolic functions of p53
contribute to its tumour suppression activity. Here we show that, by transcriptional
suppression of SLC7A11, a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, p53 inhibits
cystine uptake and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death.
Moreover, the p533KR mutant, which is defective for p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest,
apoptosis and senescence, retains the ability to inhibit SLC7A11 expression and thereby
regulate cystine metabolism and ferroptotic cell death. Using p533KR/3KRMdm2−/− mutant
mice, we further show that this aspect of p53 function contributes critically to embryonic
development and the lethality associated with loss of Mdm2. Ferroptosis is associated with
metabolic dysfunction that results in production of both cytosolic and lipid ROS,
independent of mitochondria15,25. By repressing SLC7A11 transcription, p53 activation
reduces cystine uptake, which in turn limits production of intracellular glutathione (GSH),
the primary cellular antioxidant. Thus, the sensitivity of ROS-induced ferroptosisis
markedly increased in p53-activated cells. Notably, SLC7A11 is overexpressed in many
types of human cancers and the levels of SLC7A11 are critical for the sensitivity of
ferroptotic responses. By using the p533KR mutant in xenograft tumour models, we show
that high levels of SLC7A11 expression lead to a significant abrogation of the tumour
growth suppression activity induced by p533KR, which is independent of cell-cycle arrest,
apoptosis and senescence.

Our data indicate that p53-mediated transcriptional repression of SLC7A11 is critical for
ROS-induced ferroptosis. Nonetheless, it is possible that additional p53 target genes may
contribute to this novel p53 response. Future investigations are required to elucidate the
roles of other metabolic targets of p53 in regulating ferroptosis. Interestingly, previous
studies have shown that p53 ameliorates oxidative stress by upregulating metabolic targets,
such as TIGAR (also known as C12 or f5) and GLS2, that decrease cellular levels of
ROS30–37. Yet, we found that p53-mediated ferroptosis can be triggered by high levels of
ROS (Fig. 6), consistent with the observation that ferroptosis is characterized by a lethal
iron-dependent accumulation of lipid ROS15,25. Although numerous studies implicate ROS
in both metabolism and tumorigenes is, the mechanisms that underlie cellular responses to
ROS are poorly understood. Nevertheless, the divergent effects of p53 on cellular ROS
levels suggest an intriguing model. In response to low or basal ROS levels, p53 may prevent
cells from accumulating lethal levels of ROS while also allowing survival and repair of
moderate oxidative damage. However, in response to higher or inappropriate ROS levels
(such as in cancer cells), p53 may instead promote the removal of unsalvageable cancer cells
through ferroptosis. This model is reminiscent of the divergent effects of p53 on the cellular
response to DNA damage1–6. In that scenario, p53 activation promotes cell survival and
repair of genotoxic damage (through target genes that facilitate cell cycle checkpoints and
DNA repair) in response to low levels of DNA damage; however, upon severe DNA

damage, high levels of p53-mediated apoptotic cell death eliminate damaged cells
permanently. Taken together, our findings suggest that p53-mediated effects on cystine
metabolism, ROS responses and ferroptotic cell-death represent a novel mechanism of
tumour suppression.

Methods
Cell culture and stable lines

Author Manuscript

Cells were previously obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
maintained in 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. All media used were supplemented with 10%
FBS, 100 units per ml penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin. H1299, U2OS and MCF7
cells were maintained in DMEM medium; SOAS-2 cells in McCoy's 5A medium. MEFs
were generated from day 13.5 embryos according to standard procedures. FBS used for
MEFs was heat-inactivated and supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids. To
generate inducible stable lines, wild-type and 3KR (K117R, K161R and K162R) mouse p53
complementary DNA were cloned into tet-on pTRIPZ inducible expression vector (Thermo
Open Biosystems). All sequences have been confirmed before transfection using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), followed by selection and maintenance with puromycin (1
μg ml−1) in DMEM medium containing 10% tetracycline-free FBS. To induce the
expression of p53, 0.1 μg ml−1 of doxycycline was added to the culture medium. To
generate cells with stable knockdown of p53, U2OS cells were infected with GIPZ short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) non-silencing control or shRNA against TP53 (Thermo Scientific)
with the following target sequences: 3LHS_333919, TACACATGTAGTTGTAGTG and
3LHS_333920, TCTCTTCCTCTGTGCGCCG. Cells were then selected with puromycin (1
μg ml−1) for 2weeks.

Microarray and statistical analysis
Tet-on mouse wild-type p53 stable line cells were induced by doxycycline (0.1 μg ml−1) for
0 or 24 h before total RNA was extracted. RNA was further purified by RNeasy column
(Qiagen) and processed for expression microarray (Affymetrix human gene ST 1.0)
following the manufacturer's instructions. Each condition was done in technical duplicates.
Array data were analysed by Partek software (ver. 6.6) and selected genes that are
differentially expressed (false-discovery-rate-corrected P value less than 0.05) between the
induced and non-induced cells were listed in Extended Data Fig. 1. A two-tailed Student's ttest was used for comparisons between two groups and a P value of less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample
size.

Plasmids and tranfection
Full-length cDNA of SLC7A11 was amplified by PCR from human HeLa Marathon-Ready
cDNA (Clonetech) and cloned into either TOPO (Invitrogen) or pCIN4-HA expression
vector. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for plasmid transfection according to the
manufacturer's protocols.

The procedure was performed essentially as described previously38 with minor
modifications. In brief, cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10min at room
temperature and neutralized by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125M. After
washing twice with cold PBS, cells were harvested and suspended in cold lysis buffer (10
mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40, 5 mM EDTA, 0.25% triton and 1× proteinase
inhibitor). After 10 min incubation on ice, nuclei were harvested and re-suspended in LB3
buffer and sonicated to achieve DNA fragments of 200–500 base pairs. Magnetic beads
coated with specific antibodies or IgG control were added to lysate and incubated overnight.
Next day, beads were washed seven times with washing buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500
mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40 and 0.7% Na-deoxycholate) and once with TE buffer
before the protein–DNA complex was eluted from the beads. After reverse crosslinking
overnight at 55 °C, DNA was extracted and analysed by PCR followed by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis or by quantitative PCR.
RNA extraction, RT–PCR and sequencing of tumour samples
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed by M-MuLV reverse transcriptase and
Random Primer 9 (NEB) following manufacturer's protocol. Semi-quantitative RT–PCR

Western blotting and antibodies

Author Manuscript

Proteins were lysed from cells using RIPA buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150
mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% SDS and fresh 1×
proteinase inhibitor. Concentration was determined by the Bradford method using Bio-Rad
protein assay before proteins were equally loaded and separated in polyacrylamide gels.
Proteins were then transferred to Hybond ECL membrane (GE healthcare) and incubated
overnight with primary antibodies against SLC7A11 (ab37185, abcam), p53 (human: Do-1,
SantaCruz;mouse:CM5, Leica biosystems), MDM2 (Ab5, Millipore), TIGAR (E-2, Santa
Cruz), PUMA (H-136, Santa Cruz), p21 (SX118, Santa Cruz), cleaved caspase 3 (9664, Cell

Sigma-Aldrich), vinculin (V9264, Sigma-Aldrich) and haemagglutinin (11867431001,
Roche). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used and western blot signals were
detected on autoradiographic films after incubating with ECL (GE healthcare) or
SuperSignal West Dura reagents (Thermo scientific).
Colony formation assay

Author Manuscript

H1299 cells were transfected with either empty vector or Flag-tagged
p533KR,haemagglutinin-tagged SLC7A11 expression plasmids. Cells were split 48 h posttransfectionand seeded into 10-cm dishes at a density of 1,000 cells per dish and cultured in
the presence of G418 (600 μg ml−1) for12 days. Cells were then fixed in ice-cold methanol
and stained with crystal violet solution. Numbers of visible colonies were counted using
ImageJ.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay

Author Manuscript

Flag-tagged wild-type p53 protein was purified from transfected 293 cells. A DNA probe
containing the p53 binding site for SLC7A11 was PCR-amplified, labelled with γ-32P-dATP
by T4 kinase (NEB) and purified using Bio-Spin 30 columns (Bio-Rad). The protein–DNA
binding reactions (total of 20 μl) contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 80 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 12.5% glycerol, 2mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 0.7 mM DTT, 200 ng μl−1 BSA,
20 ng μl−1 sheared salmon sperm DNA, 10–20 fmol DNA probe and 200 ng Flag–p53.In
supershift assays, 200 ng anti-p53 pAb421 antibody (Millipore) was added to the reaction. A
non-radioactive labelled probe in excess of 100 or 200 fold was used to compete with
the 32P-labelled radioactive probe.
Drugs, cell death inhibitors and ROS treatment
All drugs were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. Ferrostatin-1 was
from Xcess Biosciences. Drugs or cell death inhibitors are used at the following
concentrations: nutlin-3a, 10 μM; ferr-1, 2 μM; 3-methylademine,2 mM; necrostatin-1, 10

1 mM. ROS were generated by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH). Concentrations of TBH
used in experiments shown in Fig. 6 are: 60 μM for Fig. 6a, 100 μM for Fig. 6b, 350 μM for
Fig. 6c and 200 μM for Fig. 6e with erastin at 1 μM. Cells were about 50% confluent when
medium containing TBH was added. Specific cell death inhibitors were added at the same
time when erastin or TBH treatment was started.
Cell death assay
For cell death assays involving p53 activation, p53 was pre-activated for 24 h by either
doxycycline (in tet-on stable line cells) or nutlin (in cancer cells) followed by treatment with
either erastin orTBH. For quantification of cell death, cells were trypsinized and stained with
trypan blue followed by counting with a haemocytometer using standard protocol. Cells
stained blue were considered as dead cells. Quantification of cell death was further
confirmed by propidium iodide staining followed by FACS analysis.

Cystine uptake assay
Cells cultured in six-well plates were washed twice in pre-warmed Na+-free uptake buffer
containing 137 mM choline chloride, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,5 mM Dglucose, 0.7 mM K2HPO4 and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in 1 ml
uptake buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. Buffer was replaced with 600 μl uptake buffer containing
14C] cystine (0.2 μCi ml−1) (PerkinElmer) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. Cells
L-[3,3′were then washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer followed by addition of 600 μl of
NaOH (0.1M) to lyse the cells. Cell lysate (80 μl) was added into 1 ml scintillation fluid and
radioactive 14C counts per minute (CPM) were obtained in a scintillation counter.

Mouse xenograft

Author Manuscript

Pooled stable cell lines were derived from H1299 tet-on p533KR cells by transfecting either
control vector or vector overexpressing SLC7A11. Cells were selected by G418 (1 mg ml−1)
for 2 weeks and then treated with or without doxycycline (0.5 μg ml−1) for 40 h. Cells (1.5 ×
106) were then mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 1:1 ratio (volume) and injected
subcutaneously into nude mice (NU/NU, Charles River). Mice were fed either with control
food or food containing doxycycline hyclate (Harlan, 625 mg kg−1). Four weeks after
injection, mice were euthanized and tumours were dissected from under the skin.
