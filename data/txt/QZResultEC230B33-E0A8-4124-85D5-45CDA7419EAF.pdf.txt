Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most
common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal
tract and are caused by activating mutations of the KIT or
PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinase genes [1-3]. This causative relationship between single gene mutation and tumor
formation was key for the extremely successful introduction of the small molecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate
(Gleevec) in the treatment of this hitherto deadly disease.
Despite this success story with greater than 85% of patients
with metastatic disease benefiting from imatinib therapy
[4], there are a number of problems. Remissions are often
incomplete and, most importantly, the majority of patients
develop resistance to imatinib during the course of treatment [5]. The most common mechanisms of imatinibresistance are additional, secondary mutations of KIT or
PDFGRA that affect the conformation of the kinase domain
and therefore make imatinib unable to bind while the oncogenic kinase activity is retained [6]. Unfortunately, only a
subset of imatinib-resistant mutated kinases are sensitive to
sunitinib, a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor approved for the
treatment of imatinib-resistant GISTs [7, 8]. The development of alternative approaches to treat patients with GIST
that failed first and second line therapies is hence imperative.

that occurred within minutes whereas the onset of apoptosis took considerably longer with maximum cell death
after approximately three days. While these results suggest
that kinase inhibition plays a pivotal role in inducing GIST
cell apoptosis, they left unanswered what may happen in
the lag period between kinase shut-down and apoptosis. A
study published in 2007 by Liu and co-workers provided
insights into this question by showing that imatinib-treated
GIST cells developed a massive upregulation of a histone
protein of the H2A family, histone H2AX [10]. H2AX is
well known for its role in the cellular response to DNA
double-stranded breaks [11]. Liu and co-workers could
demonstrate that H2AX was a potent inducer of apoptosis
in GIST cells and that this novel function was not primarily
associated with its role as nucleosomal factor in the DNA
damage response. Instead, induction of apoptosis was a
novel, non-nucleosomal function of this protein since the
majority of it was found to be in soluble subcellular fractions. Mechanistically, free H2AX may non-specifically
bind to DNA and/or chromatin thereby blocking transcription and causing cell death. Importantly, Liu and coworkers made the observation that H2AX was regulated
by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery in GIST cells and
that proteasome inhibition led to increased levels of H2AX.
These findings laid the groundwork for the recent study by
Bauer and co-workers [12] who asked the question whether
it would be possible to trigger GIST cell apoptosis with
the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade). Bortezomib has previously been used mostly for the
treatment of multiple myeloma, a hematologic malignancy
that affects plasma cells [13]. Bauer et al. showed that bortezomib causes cell death not only in imatinib-sensitive
GIST cells but also in imatinib-resistant GIST cells. These
results provided compelling evidence that the induction

The prevailing mechanism of GIST cell eradication is
through apoptotic cell death, although recent studies have
shown that a fraction of imatinib-treated tumor cells do not
die but instead enter quiescence [9]. Since such cells can
serve as seeds for relapse and potentially refractory disease, it is desirable to push as many tumor cells as possible
towards apoptosis. Studies analyzing the dynamics of GIST
cell apoptosis following imatinib treatment led to the puzzling observation that kinase inhibition was a rapid effect

of apoptosis is still possible despite the presence of resistance mutations when the proper downstream mechanisms
were targeted. Obviously these results prompted an in
depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying the response
to bortezomib. As expected from previous studies, bortezomib-treated cells showed a significant increase of the
levels of soluble H2AX. Surprisingly, this was not the only
mechanism leading to GIST cell apoptosis as Bauer et al.
also found that bortezomib-treated cells showed an almost
complete loss of the KIT kinase protein itself. Further follow-up studies revealed that this downregulation of KIT
expression was caused by a massive inhibition of transcription similar to the transcriptional shut-down inducible with
the RNA polymerase II inhibitor a-amanitin. Although one
possible explanation for this finding was that the increase
of H2AX was causing the decreased transcription of KIT,
depletion of H2AX only incompletely rescued cells from
bortezomib suggesting additional effects to be involved
and no downregulation of KIT protein is usually seen after
imatinib treatment. Interestingly, inhibition of the NF-Ä¸B
signaling cascade, a key mechanism of action of bortezomib reported in multiple myeloma [14], seemed not to play
a major role in bortezomib-treated GIST cells. Collectively,
these results suggest that bortezomib has a dual negative
effect on GIST cell viability via upregulation of the proapoptotic histone H2AX and downregulation of the oncogenic KIT kinase.

in human cells remain to be determined. Given the fact
that H2AX is polyubiquitylated, the identification of an E3
ubiquitin ligase should yield important insight in its regulation. Related to this problem is the question how KIT
interferes with the H2AX degradation machinery to keep
H2AX low. Although the pro-apoptotic activities of H2AX
are carried out by soluble protein, its constitutive downregulation may cause a global depletion of the protein in cellular nucleosomes and hence impair the response to DNA
damage. It will be important to test whether re-expression
of H2AX can restore GIST cell sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy,
which could be exploited for combination therapies.
The dramatic loss of KIT protein expression following
bortezomib treatment likewise raises several questions. It
is currently unclear what the precise mechanisms of the
transcriptional shut-down in bortezomib-treated GIST
cells may be. The most straightforward explanation would
be that inhibition of the proteasome leads to an accumulation of negative transcriptional regulators. This effect is
unlikely to be sequence-specific but rather targeting the
global transcriptional machinery, such as the loss of initiating and elongating RNA polymerase II, but not total RNA
polymerase II protein, an effect that is seen in bortezomibtreated GIST cells. A disruption of the proper proteolytic
turnover of transcription factors or components of the transcriptional machinery is another possibility that needs to be
taken into consideration. It has been shown that the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery is critically involved in the
regulation of transcription initiation and elongation [15].
Another critical question is why GIST cells are so sensitive
to the loss of ongoing KIT transcription. We (unpublished
results) and others [16] have shown that mutant KIT pro-

A number of important questions arise from these findings. First, the source of soluble, pro-apoptotic H2AX in
GIST cells remains to be determined. It is not clear whether
the increase is triggered by newly synthesized H2AX or
whether the protein has been evicted from chromatin.
Second, the mechanisms that normally limit H2AX levels

Fig. 1. Bortezomib reverses two aspects of GIST cell
biology. GIST cells rely on a high rate of ongoing KIT
transcription in order to maintain continuous expression
of the less stable mutant protein and hence oncogenic
signaling. Previous results have shown that one function of oncogenic KIT is to downregulate expression of
the pro-apoptotic histone H2A family member H2AX
through protein degradation. Treatment of GIST cells
with bortezomib was found to increase H2AX levels,
which can lead to soluble non-nucleosomal H2AX and
enhanced cell death. At the same time, bortezomib was
found to trigger an almost complete loss of KIT protein
expression involving a transcriptional shut-down. Soluble H2AX itself can block ongoing gene transcription, so
it is possible that this activity contributes to the downregulation of KIT transcription in bortezomib-treated
cells. It is also possible that downregulation of other
mRNAs than KIT plays a role in this process since a
general inhibition of RNA polymerase II-mediated gene
transcription was observed. Note: The precise intracellular site and mechanism of H2AX proteasomal degradation remains to be determined.

tein is less stable compared to wildtype protein, indicating
that its constant production is necessary to provide constant oncogenic stimulation. A translational aspect of these
results would be to test whether transcriptional inhibitors
can be used to induce GIST cell death. Whether bortezomib
also affects other pathways such as chaperone proteins to
downregulate KIT protein expression remains to be determined.

Even without considering other downstream effectors of
oncogenic KIT, the signaling pathways that control H2AX
and KIT expression in GIST cells are likely to be extremely
target-rich. There are hence realistic expectations that more
specific approaches can be developed for future interventions against GISTs with an aim towards cure.
