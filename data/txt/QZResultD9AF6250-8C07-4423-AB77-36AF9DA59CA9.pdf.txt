ABSTRACT:
Trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) could explain the high rate of
primary resistance to single-agent trastuzumab in HER2 gene-amplified breast cancer
patients. The identification of agents with strong selective toxicity for trastuzumabresistant breast CSCs may have tremendous relevance for how HER2+ breast cancer
patients should be treated. Using the human breast cancer cell line JIMT-1, which
was established from the pleural metastasis of a patient who was clinically resistant
to trastuzumab ab initio, we examined whether preferential killing of the putative
CD44+CD24-/low breast CSC population might be sufficient to overcome primary
resistance to trastuzumab in vivo. Because recent studies have shown that the antidiabetic biguanide metformin can exert antitumor effects by targeted killing of CSClike cells, we explored whether metformin’s ability to preferentially kill breast cancer
initiating CD44+CD24-/low cells may have the potential to sensitize JIMT-1 xenograft
mouse models to trastuzumab. Upon isolation for breast cancer initiating CD44+CD24-/
low
cells by employing magnetic activated cell sorting, we observed the kinetics of
metformin-induced killing drastically varied among CSC and non-CSC subpopulations.
Metformin’s cell killing effect increased dramatically by more than 10-fold in
CD44+CD24-/low breast CSC cells compared to non-CD44+CD24-/low immunophenotypes.
While seven-weeks treatment length with trastuzumab likewise failed to reduce tumor
growth of JIMT-1 xenografts, systemic treatment with metformin as single agent
resulted in a significant two-fold reduction in tumor volume. When trastuzumab was
combined with concurrent metformin, tumor volume decreased sharply by more than
four-fold. Given that metformin-induced preferential killing of breast cancer initiating
CD44+CD24-/low subpopulations is sufficient to overcome in vivo primary resistance
to trastuzumab, the incorporation of metformin into trastuzumab-based regimens
may provide a valuable strategy for treatment of HER2+ breast cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

tumors overexpress the human epidermal growth factor 2
(HER2) [1]. Evidence is mounting that the CD44+CD24-/
low
cell subpopulation, which is enriched with potential
breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), could explain clinical
resistance to HER2-targeted therapies [1-3]. Therefore,

De novo (i. e. primary) resistance to the monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) remains a prevalent
challenge in the treatment of breast cancer patients whose

future clinical trials should involve the integration of novel
anti-breast cancer stem cells approaches to prevent and
overcome the inherent unresponsiveness to trastuzumab
across clinically important subgroups of HER2-positive
breast cancer patients. Although in vitro studies have
recently suggested that the anti-diabetic drug metformin
can efficiently eliminate treatment-resistant stem/
progenitor cell populations in heterogeneous breast cancer
populations [4-6], it remained to be evaluated whether
systemic metformin might overcome primary resistance
to trastuzumab in HER2-gene amplified human breast
cancer xenografts. Here we explored for the first time the
in vivo sensitizing efficacy of metformin on trastuzumab
therapy by using xenografts of the human breast cancer
cell line JIMT-1, which was established from the pleural
metastasis of a patient who was clinically resistant to
trastuzumab ab initio [7]. The JIMT-1 model is unique
because of displaying at the same time several co-existing
mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab present at
variable levels in other breast cancer cell lines, including
moderate expression levels of HER2 (despite HER2 gene
amplification), low expression of PTEN (phosphatase and
tensin homolog), an activating mutation of the PIK3CA
gene, high expression of NRG1 (neuregulin-1), and
enhanced expression of mesenchymal markers, including a
naturally enriched subpopulation of breast cancer initiating
CD44+CD24-/low CSC-like cells [2, 8-10].

estimated IC50 value of 1±0.2 mmol/L metformin whereas
that in the corresponding non-CD44+CD24-/low population
was 11±2 mmol/L metformin (Fig. 1A, bottom right).
The IC50 of metformin in the unsorted JIMT-1 parental
population was 8±2 mmol/L (Fig. 1A, bottom right).
These findings, altogether, confirmed that the breast cancer
initiating subpopulation within a heterogeneous population
of trastuzumab-refractory, HER2-positive breast cancer
cells notably exhibit greater sensitivity to the growthinhibitory effects of metformin. Indeed, the growth of
the breast cancer initiating CD44+CD24-/low population
was more significantly affected by metformin at all tested
concentrations. Because it has been shown that gradual
loss of stem cell markers takes place in cells growing
as a monolayer, these data may further underestimate
hypersensitivity of the breast cancer initiating
CD44+CD24-/low cells to metformin. Indeed, JIMT-1
cells sorted for the CD44+CD24-/low immunophenotype
repopulated all the parental cell fractions after few days in
monolayer culture (data not shown).

Systemic metformin inhibits tumor growth in
trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer xenografts
The effects of metformin and trastuzumab alone
and in combination on tumor growth were next studied
in vivo using a JIMT-1 xenograft animal model (Fig.
1B). Compared to the control group after seven weeks
of treatment (940±170 mm3), the trastuzumab-treated
group likewise failed to exhibit significant reductions
in mean tumor size (891±135 mm3). Compared to the
mean xenograft tumor size in both the control and the
trastuzumab group, the mean tumor size in the metformin
group was significantly smaller (390±64 mm3), which
confirmed that the inhibitory effect of metformin at the
tested concentration (250 mg/kg/day) was notably stronger
than that of trastuzumab (5 mg/kg/week) on JIMT-1 tumor
growth. When the two drugs were combined, the xenograft
tumor size (213±75 mm3) was smaller than those of the
groups treated with trastuzumab or metformin alone,
indicating that the combination of the drugs was much
more effective at reducing tumor volume. Consequently,
the days required for four-fold increase in tumor volume
was 27±5 after treatment with trastuzumab whereas more
than 50 days were required after the combined treatment
with trastuzumab and metformin (Fig. 1B). No significant
difference in body weight was observed in xenograft
tumor-bearing mice between the treatment groups (data
not shown).
Our current findings reveal that: a.) Metformin
as single agent is active against JIMT-1-derived tumor
xenografts with primary resistance to trastuzumab; b.)
metformin’s ability to distinctively kill breast cancer
initiating CD44+CD24-/low mesenchymal subpopulations
is sufficient to overcome in vivo primary resistance to

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Metformin preferentially kills breast cancer
initiating CD44+CD24-/low cells
We first examined whether breast cancer
initiating CD44+CD24-/low and non-CD44+CD24-/low cell
subpopulations from the trastuzumab-refractory JIMT-1
cell line exhibited differential sensitivities to the growth
inhibitory effects of metformin. We employed MTT-based
cell viability assays to compare the degree of sensitivity
to metformin of parental JIMT-1 cells and that of JIMT1 cell subpopulations isolated and purified for breast
cancer initiating CD44+CD24-/low and non-CD44+CD24-/low
immunophenotypes by employing magnetic activated cell
sorting (MACS; Fig. 1A, top panels). Cells were treated
side-by-side on the following sorting day with graded
concentrations of metformin for five days. While unsorted
JIMT-1, CD44+CD24-/low, and CD44+CD24+ populations
all showed an inhibitory response to metformin that
augmented with the increase in metformin concentration
(Fig. 1A, bottom left), each separate cell population
differed in their extend of cytotoxic response to metformin.
The breast cancer initiating CD44+CD24-/low subpopulation
was significantly more sensitive than was the parental or
CD44+CD24+ populations. CD44+CD24-/low cells had an

Figure 1: A. Top. CD44 and CD24 expression patterns in CD44+CD24-/low and CD44+CD24+ subpopulations of JIMT-1 sorted by

sequential sorting (depletion followed by positive selection) using MACS MicroBeads (MACS® Technology). Enrichment of target
cells by magnetic MicroBeads was carried out according to the manufacturer’s (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) protocol.
CD44+CD24-/low were isolated from the parental JIMT-1 cell line by firstly depleting CD24+ cells using the CD24 MicroBead Kit and
then positively selected for CD44 using the CD44 MicroBeads. Cells were fluorescently stained with combinations of fluorochromeconjugated monoclonal antibodies obtained from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA) against human CD44 (FITC; cat.#555478) and
CD24 (PE; cat.#555428) or their respective isotype controls. Representative expression (n=5) in pre-sorted and post-sorted JIMT-1 cells
is shown. Bottom. Parental JIMT-1 cells and cells sorted for BCSC+ CD44+CD24-/low and non-BCSC-CD44+CD24+ markers were treated
simultaneously with increasing concentrations of metformin for 5 days. Cell viability was determined using a standard colorimetric MTT
(3-4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) reduction assay. For each treatment, cell viability was evaluated as a
percentage using the following equation: (OD570 of treated sample/OD570 of untreated sample) × 100. Cell sensitivity to metformin was
expressed in terms of the concentration of drug required to decrease by 50% cell viability (IC50 value). Since the percentage of control
absorbance was considered to be the surviving fraction of cells, the IC50 values were defined as the concentration of agents that produced
50% reduction in control absorbance. B. Tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of 5 x 106 JIMT-1 cells suspended
in 100 μl of culture medium into the flank of female athymic nude mice (four to five weeks old, 23 to 25 g; Harlan Laboratories –France-).
Animals were randomized into four groups with five mice in each group: control (vehicles), trastuzumab, metformin, and trastuzumab +
Metformin. Trastuzumab (5 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally (i.p.) once per week. Both the “metformin group” and the “trastuzumab +
metformin group” received daily a single i.p. injection of metformin (250 mg/kg). Mice were weighed once per week after dosing, tumors
were measured daily with electronic callipers, and tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: volume (mm3) = length
x width2 x 0.5. Figure shows mean tumor volumes (±SD) of JIMT-1 xenograft-bearing nude mice following injection with trastuzumab,
metformin, and trastuzumab + metformin until seven weeks.
