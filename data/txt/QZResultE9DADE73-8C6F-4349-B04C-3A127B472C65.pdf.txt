ABSTRACT
Higher rate of glycolysis has been long observed in cancer cells, as a vital
enzyme in glycolysis, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) has been shown with great
potential as an anti-cancer target. Accumulating evidence indicates that inhibition
of LDH-A induces apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress in cancer cells. To date,
it’s still unclear that whether autophagy can be induced by LDH-A inhibition. Here,
we investigated the effects of oxamate, one classic inhibitor of LDH-A in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as well as normal lung epithelial cells. The results
showed that oxamate significantly suppressed the proliferation of NSCLC cells, while
it exerted a much lower toxicity in normal cells. As previous studies reported, LDH-A
inhibition resulted in ATP reduction and ROS (reactive oxygen species) burst in cancer
cells, which lead to apoptosis and G2/M arrest in H1395 cells. However, when being
exposed to oxamate, A549 cells underwent autophagy as a protective mechanism
against apoptosis. Furthermore, we found evidence that LDH-A inhibition induced
G0/G1 arrest dependent on the activation of GSK-3β in A549 cells. Taken together,
our results provide useful clues for targeting LDH-A in NSCLC treatment and shed
light on the discovery of molecular predictors for the sensitivity of LDH-A inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

glycolysis to produce ATP, the phenomenon is also known
as “Warburg effect” [3]. In recent years, targeting energy
metabolism has returned to the battlefield of fighting
against cancer, more details and molecular mechanisms
involved in the “Warburg effect” are increasingly
discovered, which not only make us better understand
the characteristics of cancer cells, but also provide the
Achilles’ heel to kill them[4].
Among the numerous enzymes participating in the
glycolysis, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), an isoform
of lactate dehydrogenase, is undoubtedly an remarkable
anti-cancer target with great developable potential[5, 6].
After the year of 2000, many studies found that LDH-A
was abnormally expressed in cancer cells and associated

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers
and causes more than 1.37 million deaths worldwide.
The incidence of lung cancer is still on the rise, due to the
prevalence of smoking and air pollution, especially in the
developing countries[1]. In spite of recent progress in the
treatment of lung cancer, including TKIs (tyrosine kinase
inhibitors) and anti-VEGF, the prognosis of lung cancer
remains poor, with 5-year survival rate approximately
18%[2]. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel
strategies to treat lung cancer.
It is noticed long before that cancer cells have higher
uptake of glucose and more dependent on the anerobic

with poor prognosis, suggesting that LDH-A played an
important role in tumor maintenance[7-12]. Then, Le,
et al. reported that inhibition of LDH-A reduced ATP
levels and induced apoptosis though the accumulation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lymphoma cells[13].
Subsequently, a number of studies found similar results
in other types of tumor cells including renal cancer[14],
breast cancer[15], hepatocellular carcinoma[16, 17],
nasopharyngeal carcinoma[18] and pancreatic cancer[19]
. Besides, the results also indicate that LDH-A inhibition
could suppress the migration of cancer cells and enhance
their sensitivity to the traditional chemotherapy and
radiotherapy[18-21]. Especially, the findings are also
encouraging in lung cancer cells. Very recently, it was
demonstrated that LDH-A was essential for cancerinitiating cell proliferation and could be a feasible
therapeutic target for non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC)
treatment in mouse models[22].
Since lung cancer, particularly non-small cell
carcinoma is one kind of highly heterogeneous tumors
with various genetic expressions, and specific treatment

is not always effective to all types of lung cancer[23],
we built the hypothesis that different NSCLC cells might
exhibit different responses to LDH-A inhibitors. In the
present study, we investigated the effect of oxamate, one
classic inhibitor of LDH-A[24, 25], in several cell lines
of NSCLC, as well as normal lung epithelial HBE cells.
The purpose of our study is to examine the effectivity of
LDH-A inhibition in NSCLC cells and explore the related
mechanism.

RESULTS
Different growth inhibition effects of oxamate in
NSCLC cells
Firstly, MTT assays were performed to investigate
the effect of LDH-A inhibition by oxamate on the cell
proliferation in NCSLC cells and normal lung epithelial
cells. As shown in Figure 1A, we found that oxamate

HBE cells. All Data above represented the average of three independent experiments and were shown as means ± SD, * p<0.05 versus

obviously inhibited the viability of A549, H1975, H1395
cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, the IC50 (50%
inhibitory concentration) at 24h of oxamate sodium were
58.53±4.74, 32.13±2.50 and 19.67±1.53 mmol/L for A549,
H1975 and H1395 cells, respectively, while oxamate
exerted much lower toxicity in normal lung epithelial cell
line HBE cells with its IC50 96.73±7.60 mmol/L.
Then, to further confirm the LDH-A inhibition
effect of oxamate as previously reported and understand
the alteration of energy metabolism in cells, several
intracellular biochemical indicators were detected in both
A549 and HBE cells. As a result, after treatment with
oxamate for 24h, LDH activity, ATP content and NADPH/
NADP ratio were found to be decreased significantly in

A549 cells, while ROS content was distinctly increased
(Figure 1D-F). In contrast, although the LDH enzyme
was also inhibited in HBE cells in a dose-dependent way,
however, the glucose metabolism was less influenced
(Figure 1G-I).

Cycle arrest induced by LDH-A inhibition in
NSCLC cells
Cell cycle is a reflection of cell growth and division,
which is easily disturbed by external stress[26]. Therefore,
we next examined the effects of LDH-A inhibition on
cycle progression in HBE, H1395 and A549 cells. All the
cells were treated with different concentrations of oxamate

Figure 2: Different effects of oxamate on the cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells and normal lung epithelial cells. Cells were
treated with 0, 20, 50, 100 mM oxamate for 24h, and then were analyzed by flow cytometry after PI staining. (A) HBE cells; (B) H1395

(0, 20, 50, 100mmol) for 24h, and then were analyzed by
flow cytometry after PI staining.
As shown in Figure 2A, no dose-dependent
changes were observed in cell cycle progression with the
concentrations of oxamate in normal lung epithelial HBE
cells, in accordance with the effect on the cell viability.
Meanwhile, we found that the numbers of H1395 cells
in G2/M phase were increased in a dose-dependent
manner after treatment with 0, 20, 50, 100mmol oxamate,
the proportions of cells at G2/M were 12.74±1.78%,
16.55±1.20%, 19.09±3.56%, and 26.20±4.57%,
respectively (p<0.05), while the percentages of cells in
G0/G1 phase were consequently deceased (Figure 2B).
Intriguingly, there was another scenario in A549 cells,
as shown in Figure 3C, oxamate induced significant G0/
G1 arrest in A549 cells, after being exposed to 0, 20, 50,
100 mmol/L oxamate, the proportions of cells at G0/G1
phase were 51.88±0.14%, 58.50±0.28%, 67.79±0.58%
and 78.24±2.4%, respectively (p<0.05). In addition, we
noticed that the ratios of cells in the sub-G1 phase were not
elevated significantly except in H1395 cells.

involved in glycolysis in cancer cells[18, 19, 27, 28].
However, we found that oxamate induced significant
G0/G1 arrest, instead of G2/M arrest in A549 cells in our
study. To explore the molecular mechanisms under the G0/
G1 arrest in A549 cells, we performed western blotting
to detect the changes of cell cycle-related proteins in
A549 cells after treatment of oxamate for 24h. As shown
in Figure 3A, we found that the expression of cyclin D1
was in a dose-dependent decrease, accompanied by a
reduction in the levels of CDK2 and cyclin E, while the
expression pattern of cyclin B1 was basically unchanged
(Figure 3A). Next, we continued to test other proteins in
upstream signal pathways affecting cell cycle, the results
showed that the expressions of p53, SIRT1, NF-κB did
not alter significantly after treatment of oxamate (Figure
4A). However, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which
plays an important role in cell proliferation, metabolism
and cycle regulation[29], was obviously inhibited.
Notably, the levels of p-Akt and p-c-raf were decreased
dramatically in a dose-dependent way. Consistent with
this, the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β
(GSK-3β) at Ser-9, a substrate of p-Akt[30, 31], was also
inhibited significantly, accompanied with an enhanced
function.
It has been long known that cyclin D1 can be
down-regulated by the activation of GSK-3β, which
phosphorylated cyclin D1 that triggers its subsequent
degradation[32, 33]. To further verify the role of Akt-

G0/G1 arrest in A549 cells was dependent on the
activation of GSK-3β
Earlier studies have reported that G2/M arrest was
induced by the inhibition of LDH-A or other enzymes

indicated antibodies, β-actin was used as a loading control. (B) A549 cells were pre-treated with 20 mM LiCl followed by combination

Oxamate triggered apoptosis in H1395 while not
in A549cells

GSK-3β-cyclin D1 signal pathway in the G0/G1 arrest
induced by LDH-A inhibition, we therefore employed
lithium chloride (LiCl, 20 mmol/L), an inhibitor of GSK3β, to treat A549 cells with oxamate together. The results,
in accord with our expectations, showed that the G0/G1
arrest induced by oxamate was reversed almost completely
by lithium (Figure 3B). Taken together, these data
indicated that oxamate-induced G0/G1 arrest was possibly
mediated by the changes of G0/G1 cyclins, especially
caused by the degradation of cyclin D1, which resulted
from the de-phosphorylation and activation of GSK-3β.

Apoptosis is one of the major responses to
LDH-A inhibition in cancer cells, as previous studies
reported[13-15]. To investigate the effect of oxamate
on the apoptosis in different NSCLC cells, AnnexinV/
PI double staining assays were conducted. As shown in
Figure 4A, after treatment with 0, 20, 50, 100 mmol/L
oxamate for 24h, the percentages of cells at apoptosis
increased significantly in H1395 cells, the apoptosis

cells

rates were 2.15±0.16%, 6.24±1.50%, 16.36±3.23% and
29.66±4.34% respectively. By contrast, the apoptosis rates
in A549 cells after treatment with oxamate were all at low
levels, similar with the control group.
The mechanism under the apoptosis induced by
LDH-A inhibition has been well studied in other similar
studies, and the results indicate that ROS mediated
mitochondrial pathway plays a key role[13, 15, 17]. In
the present study, the ROS contents were also enhanced
in A549 cells, but relatively lower than the extent in other
cells (Figure 1F). To verify that there was no apoptosis
induced by oxamate in A549 cells, the expression changes
of apoptotic markers, including bcl-2, bax and caspase-3,
were explored by western blotting, the results showed that
these proteins did not change clearly after treatment with
oxamate. Negative results were also obtained with other
key regulators in apoptosis, such as p53, SIRT1, NF-κ B
(Figure 4C).

In our previous experiments, LDH-A inhibition by
oxamate was found not induce apoptosis in A549 cells, we
tried to explore the mechanism of growth suppression in
A549 cells using MDC staining. After treating A549 cells
with oxamate for 24h, the appearance of acidic vesicles
was indeed observed in the cytoplasm of oxamate-treated
cells, indicating that autophagy might occur in A549
cells. Next, we detected the expression changes of LC3, an autophagy marker, to confirm the phenomenon. As
shown in Figure 5B, the expression of LC3-II protein
was increased in A549 cells following 24 h of oxamate
treatment, especially in 50 and 100 mM groups, whereas
the expression level of LC3-I was decreased to some
extent, which is compatible with an enhanced autophagic
flux.
To further investigate the role of autophagy
in the anti-proliferation of oxamate in A549 cells

and its relationship with apoptosis, we next adopted
3-methylademine (3-MA, 10 mM), an autophagy inhibitor,
to treat A549 cells simultaneously with oxamate for
24h, and MDC/PI dual staining showed that there were
a large number of PI-positive cells in 3-MA combined
with oxamate group. Consist with the results of MDC/
PI staining, the quantitative flow cytometry demonstrated
that the apoptosis rate was significantly higher in the
cells treated with both 3-MA and oxamate, compared to
the control cells or the cells treated with oxamate alone.
Therefore, the results suggested that LDH-A inhibition
by oxamate induced autophagy in A549 cells, which
protected the cells against apoptosis.

Autophagy is a self-eating process, in which cellular
components are degraded through the lysosomal system
to maintain homeostasis[37]. Under metabolic stress,
cancer cells can use autophagy as a source of energy and
biomolecules to adapt and survive in the unfavorable
environment[38]. Here, we firstly reported that LDH-A
inhibition induced autophagy in human non-small cell
lung cancer A549 cells, as evidenced by appearance of
autophagic vacuoles and LC-3 degradation, our data
also showed that the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway
was inhibited significantly after oxamate treatment, and
might involve in the regulation of the metabolism and
autophagy induced by LDH-A inhibition. Moreover, the
autophagy inhibitor 3-MA blocked the autophagy and
triggered apoptosis again in human A549 cells, which
was similar to the situation in H1395 cells, suggesting
that the autophagy was a protective mechanism against
apoptosis and contributed to the drug resistance of LDH-A
inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that autophagy
plays an important role in glucose metabolism and the
maintenance of lung tumor’s malignancy[39]. Basing on
these above, our study further indicates that combined
inhibition of autophagy is a worthy strategy to overcome
the drug resistance of LDH-A inhibitor in NSCLC cells.
Another interesting phenomenon is that we observed
different cell cycle arrest coupled with apoptosis or
autophagy. In H1395 cells, after treatment with oxamate,
cells arrested in G2/M cycle were associated with damaged
mitochondrial function and susceptive to apoptosis,
however, G0/G1 quiescence in A549 cells was related to
increased autophagy activity, which allows cells to survive
under the metabolic stress. Especially, our study further
found that the G0/G1 arrest in A549 cells was dependent
on the activation of p-GSK-3β, which is at the downstream signal transduction of Akt/mTOR pathway[40]. In
agreement with our results, An, et al currently reported
that autophagy is necessary for G0/G1 arrest under
nitrogen starvation in saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
concluded that such cycle arrest might permit the cells
to adapt the nutrient deprivation [41]. In addition to this,
our results also demonstrated that when the oxamateinduced G0/G1 quiescence was disrupted by lithium, the
changes in the percentage of apoptotic cells were not
significant, the results indicate that G0/G1 arrest might be
an accompaniment activity with autophagy, however, the
intervention of cycle progression will not determine the
final destiny of cells with LDH-A inhibition.
Since lung cancer is one kind of highly heterogenous
tumors, biomarkers are vitally important in improving the
effectivity of target therapy[42]. As is well-known, EGFR
mutation has been proven successfully as a predictor
in TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), which save many
patients’ lives as well as money[43]. As the development
of more effective LDH-A inhibitors (also including
other glycolysis inhibitors), now there is a pressing need
to seek for biomarkers to predict sensitivity and screen

DISCUSSION
LDH-A has been widely investigated as an antitumor target in previous studies, and accumulating
evidence indicates that inhibition of LDH-A induces
apoptosis though mitochondrial pathway mediated by
oxidative stress[13, 15, 17, 18]. To date, it’s still unkown
that whether autophagy can be induced by LDH-A
inhibition. In the present study, we firstly revealed that
oxamate, a classic LDHA inhibitor induced autophagy
in A549 cells, and addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-MA
with oxamate caused apoptosis again in A549 cells.
Another interesting phenomenon found in our study was
that LDH-A inhibition induced G0/G1 arrest dependent
on the activation of glycogen synthase kinase -3β. Most
of all, these findings were based on a multiple context,
we employed HBE cells as a normal control, and also
observed the apoptosis and G2/M arrest induced by
LDH-A inhibition in H1395 cells. The distinct responses
to oxamate in different NSCLC cells suggest that the
effects of LDH-A inhibition are more complicated than
they appeared before.
LDH-A is a key enzyme in anaerobic glycolysis,
by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate into lactate.
When the LDH-A is inhibited, more pyruvate will enter
into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and more oxygen
is needed. However, since cancer cells tend to overly
depend on aerobic glycolysis, which generates ATP faster
and provides more precursors to meet the metabolic
requirements of rapid proliferation[34], TCA cycle and
subsequent mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) pathway in them are always impaired and
dysfunctional[35]. Consequently, increased ROS are
produced, which activate apoptosis though caspase-3
pathway[36]. In the present study, we further confirmed
the apoptosis induced by LDH-A inhibition in H1395
cells, and also found that LDH-A inhibition induced G2/M
arrest, as reported previously[18, 27, 28]. Moreover,
the toxicity of oxamate was much lower in normal lung
epithelial HBE cells, the results demonstrate that LDH-A
is also a potential target for cancer therapy in NSCLC
patients.

patients who will benefit most from those inhibitors[19,
44, 45]. For instance, not long ago, Birsoy et,al reported
that mtDNA mutations might be useful in determining
the sensitivity of cancer cells to glucose limitation[46].
Our results indicated that the biological consequences
of LDH-A inhibition are more complex than we thought
before in NSCLC cells, and the signal molecules in Akt/
mTOR and autophagy pathway might be of potential value
to predict the efficacy of LDH-A inhibitors.
In conclusion, we find that NSCLC cells exhibit
different responses to LDH-A inhibition in our study, and
provide novel insights into the signaling pathways shifting
cancer cells towards apoptosis or autophagy, as well as
different cell cycle arrests, which are helpful for searching
biomarkers to monitor the efficacy of glycolysis inhibitors
and contribute to more favorable outcomes in the future
clinical trials. The results also suggest that combined
autophagy inhibition may be an attractive strategy to
enhance the sensitivity of LDH-A inhibitors in drugresistant cells.

LDH Activity Assay kit (Biovision, Tucson, AZ,
USA) was used to determine the intracellular LDH
activity. In this test, LDH reduces NAD to NADH, which
interacts with a specific probe to produce a color (λmax =
450nm), which is then detected by colorimetric assay.
Results were expressed as percentage of LDHA activity
normalized to protein concentration, which were measured
by BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, Haimen, China).

ATP detection
Intracellular ATP was detected using a luciferasebased ATP assay kit (Beyotime, Haimen, China),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells treated
with different doses of oxamate were harvested and lysed.
Then, optical density was measured using a microplate
reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) and normalized to
protein concentration.

Reactive Oxygen Species Measurements

Reagents and cell culture

Cells were stained with 2’,7’-dichloro-fluoresce in
diacetate (DCFH-DA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Beyotime,China), and the fluorescence
intensity was measured by a flow cytometry at 530nm.

Oxamate sodium was purchased from SigmaAldrich Corp (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human non-small
cell lung cancer cell lines including A549, H1975 and
H1395 were used, normal lung epithelial cell line HBE
was employed as a normal control. All the cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, USA), and cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) containing
10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2.

Analysis of cell cycle distribution
After 24h incubation with different doses of
oxamate, cells were collected and fixed with 70% precooled ethanol overnight, after staining with propidium
iodide (10 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in the dark for 30 min.
Flow cytometry was performed on the FACS Calibur
system (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) and cell

to test the effects of oxamate sodium on cell viability at
different concentrations or times. Cells were seeded at
104/well in 96-well plates, and treated with fresh media
containing different doses of oxamate (0-100 mmol/L).
After 24h, 48h and 72h incubation, respectively, 20 µl of
MTT solution (5 mg/L) was added into each well, then the
plates were incubated in the dark for 4 h. The supernatant
was removed and the precipitates were dissolved in 150
µl dimethyl sulfoxide for 10 min. Optical density was
measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments,
Inc.,Winooski, VT, USA) at 570 nm.

Apoptosis analysis
