SUMMARY

CXCR2 has been suggested to have both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive properties. Here we show
that CXCR2 signaling is upregulated in human pancreatic cancer, predominantly in neutrophil/myeloidderived suppressor cells, but rarely in tumor cells. Genetic ablation or inhibition of CXCR2 abrogated metastasis, but only inhibition slowed tumorigenesis. Depletion of neutrophils/myeloid-derived suppressor cells
also suppressed metastasis suggesting a key role for CXCR2 in establishing and maintaining the metastatic
niche. Importantly, loss or inhibition of CXCR2 improved T cell entry, and combined inhibition of CXCR2 and
PD1 in mice with established disease significantly extended survival. We show that CXCR2 signaling in the
myeloid compartment can promote pancreatic tumorigenesis and is required for pancreatic cancer metastasis, making it an excellent therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an almost universally lethal malignancy and represents a significant therapeutic
challenge (http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats). Gemcitabine has been the standard of care for patients since 1997,
despite offering only marginal benefit (Burris et al., 1997). Recent
improvements in survival using FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine
plus nab-paclitaxel have offered a choice to clinicians for the first
time (Conroy et al., 2011; Goldstein et al., 2015). However, the

5-year survival rate remains 6%. Surgical resection is the
only potential cure; however, only 15% of patients are suitable
for surgery, and most die within 2 years of surgery due to recurrence or metastatic disease. Thus, a greater understanding of
how key molecular and cellular regulators of tumor progression
combine to drive invasion and metastases in PDAC is required.
Pancreatic cancer develops and metastasizes as a result of the
accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic changes. Activating mutations of the KRAS proto-oncogene occur in >90%
of cases (Almoguera et al., 1988), while inactivation of tumor

Significance
PDAC is predicted to become the second commonest cause of cancer death in the United States by 2020. Aggressive invasion and early metastases are characteristic of the disease, and even the few patients eligible for potentially curative
resection inevitably develop recurrent or metastatic disease. Early indications suggest that immunotherapy will not work
in unselected pancreatic cancer patients. Our data highlight two therapeutic opportunities for PDAC: first the use of
CXCR2 inhibitors in surgically resected patients, and second the use of CXCR2 inhibition in combination with immunotherapy in surgically unresectable advanced disease. Our data also suggest that therapeutic targets that may cause senescence escape will not have deleterious effects in late-stage disease in PDAC, because tumors have already escaped this
checkpoint.

suppressor genes, including CDKN2A, TP53, SMAD4, and
BRCA2 accrue throughout disease development (Hruban et al.,
2000). Progression is a complex process and is reliant on interactions between the tumor and its microenvironment (Baumgart
et al., 2013). Ubiquitous to all PDAC is the dense desmoplastic
stroma, consisting of immune cells, stellate cells, fibroblasts,
and a dense extracellular collagenous matrix, which surrounds
PDAC cells, providing vital signals for survival, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis (Olive et al., 2009). However, two recent
studies found that targeting the stroma led to accelerated disease progression (Ozdemir et al., 2014; Rhim et al., 2014),
although both approaches provided opportunities for immunetargeting therapies. Indeed, targeting FAP+ fibroblasts in pancreatic tumor-bearing mice can synergize with anti-programmed
death 1 (anti-PD1) immunotherapy to cause tumor regression
(Feig et al., 2013). Thus, there may be a complex interplay of
tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive consequences when
targeting specific pathways.
The relationship between inflammation and PDAC progression
is complex. Initially PDAC must overcome immune surveillance; indeed, both human and mouse pancreatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PanINs) and PDAC are characterized by the infiltration
of immune suppressor cells, suggesting tumor immunity is
blocked early during tumorigenesis (Clark et al., 2007). Once immune surveillance has been bypassed, the net effect of interactions between tumor and immune cells is PDAC progression.
However, certain cell types may have the capacity for tumor
suppression and promotion in different contexts. For example,
inflammatory signaling can promote oncogene-induced senescence (Acosta et al., 2008; Kuilman et al., 2008). On the other
hand, inflammation can drive pancreatic tumorigenesis: there
is enhanced tumorigenesis in mice subjected to pancreatitis
(Guerra et al., 2007), and patients with hereditary pancreatitis
have a greatly increased risk of PDAC (Lowenfels et al., 1997).
More recently, specific inflammatory signaling pathways, such
as STAT3/IL-6 (Baumgart et al., 2014; Corcoran et al., 2011; Fukuda et al., 2011; Lesina et al., 2011), NF-kB (Daniluk et al., 2012;
Ling et al., 2012; Maniati et al., 2011), and CXCR2 (Ijichi et al.,
2011; Matsuo et al., 2009a) have been implicated in PDAC
progression.
CXCR2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor for the human CXC
chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL7,
and CXCL8. Mouse CXCR2 has a more limited repertoire of ligands because mice lack CXCL6 and CXCL8 genes. The primary
immune function of CXCR2 is the regulation of neutrophil migration, as it controls the egress of these cells from the bone
marrow, and their recruitment to sites of inflammation (Cacalano
et al., 1994; Eash et al., 2010). CXCR2 also regulates the migration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (Highfill
et al., 2014). We have previously shown that CXCR2 is fundamental to the process of tumorigenesis in both colon and skin
(Jamieson et al., 2012). However, there is growing evidence
that CXCR2 is also important for the metastatic process. For
example, Cxcr2 deletion can reduce the invasive and metastatic
potential of lung cancer cells (Saintigny et al., 2013). In models of
breast cancer, CXCR2 signaling is important for attracting Gr-1+
CD11b+ MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment, where they
drive invasion and metastasis (Yang et al., 2008). Moreover,
CXCL1/2 secretion at metastatic sites can promote the estab-

lishment of a metastatic niche by enhancing the influx of MDSCs
(Acharyya et al., 2012). Indeed, neutrophils have recently been
shown to support metastatic colonization by breast cancer cells
(Wculek and Malanchi, 2015).
There is emerging evidence for a role of neutrophils, MDSCs,
and CXCR2 in pancreatic cancer. Neutrophil infiltration is
observed in pancreatic tumors with the poorest prognosis
(Reid et al., 2011), while high levels of the CXCR2 ligand
CXCL5 are associated with poorer survival and, by implication, metastatic disease (Li et al., 2011). Recent studies have
described the contribution of MDSCs to pancreatic cancer progression (Bayne et al., 2012), and the accumulation of MDSCs in
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer correlates with disease stage (Diaz-Montero et al., 2009). Moreover, in vitro experiments and transplants in immunodeficient animals have
implicated CXCR2 in the regulation of pancreatic tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis (Matsuo et al., 2009a,
2009b; Purohit et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013). CXCR2 inhibition
has also been shown to disrupt interactions between tumor cells
and fibroblasts to slow tumor progression in a mouse model of
pancreatic cancer, although the mice used exhibit high levels
of stromal deregulation and are short lived (Ijichi et al., 2011).
These tumor-promoting properties of CXCR2 may be counterbalanced by CXCR2-dependent tumor-suppressing activities.
Of particular relevance to PDAC, are the elegant studies that
show that CXCR2 reinforces RAS-mediated senescence in
culture, and regulates the senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (Acosta et al., 2008). We therefore sought here to
determine the role of CXCR2 signaling in pancreatic tumorigenesis using relevant in vivo models.
RESULTS
CXCR2 Signaling at the Tumor Border Is Associated with
Poor Outcome in Human PDAC
To investigate the importance of CXCR2 in human pancreatic
cancer we analyzed the expression of CXCR2 and its ligands
in samples from a cohort of 44 PDAC patients. RNA was
prepared from targeted biopsies of tumor borders, and from
the adjacent normal pancreas, and chemokine and CXCR2
expression examined. We found that genes encoding CXCR2,
and two of its ligands, CXCL2 and CXCL8, were significantly
upregulated compared with adjacent normal pancreas (Figure 1A), and high CXCR2 or CXCL2 expression was associated
with significantly poorer prognosis (Figure 1B). High CXCR2
expression was also associated with advanced T stage
(p = 0.05), tumor grade (p = 0.037), and resection margin status
(p = 0.015). We next examined CXCR2 protein by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on full-face sections taken from the edges
of tumors adjacent to normal tissue, and found that high
expression was associated with poor outcome (Figure 1C).
Rather than being expressed in the tumor, most of the
observed CXCR2 staining was within the stroma (Figure 1D).
Further analysis of the cells present at these areas revealed
high numbers of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive cells indicating the presence of neutrophils or their precursors (Figure 1D). There was a significant correlation between expression
of MPO and CXCR2 in the stroma at the edge of these tumors
adjacent to normal regions (Spearman’s rho 0.907, p = 0.01).

Figure S1.

There were also high numbers of CD68+ macrophages, but few
CD3+ T cells: these cells were, however, observed in the tissue
surrounding the tumors (Figure 1D).
Interestingly, the association of CXCR2-positive cells with
prognosis appeared to depend on their location. When we
examined tissue from the tumor body (Figure S1A), neither stromal nor tumor epithelial CXCR2 expression was associated with
survival (Figure S1B). These data show that the effects of CXCR2
signaling, and recruitment of myeloid cells, differ depending on
the site to which these cells are recruited. It is clear, however,
that CXCR2 signaling and myeloid cell recruitment at the tumor
border are linked to poor outcome in patients. Importantly,
very few tumor cells expressed CXCR2.

KPC Mice Recapitulate the Microenvironment and
CXCR2 Expression Profile of Human PDAC
In order to further investigate the importance of CXCR2
signaling in PDAC we used a mouse model that both phenotypically and histologically recapitulates the human disease. KPC
(LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Pdx1-Cre) mice carry a
pancreas-specific Trp53R172H mutation alongside an initiating
mutation in KrasG12D, and develop invasive, metastatic tumors
that exhibit an extensive stroma (Hingorani et al., 2005) (Figure S2A) with significant collagen deposition (visualized by picrosirius red staining, Figure S2B), macrophage (F4/80, Figure S2C)
and neutrophil infiltration (MPO or S100A9, Figures S2D and
S2E), few CD3+ T cells (Feig et al., 2013) (Figure S2F), numerous

activated a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)-positive stellate cells
(Figure S2G), abundant levels of the pro-invasive protein tenascin C (Oskarsson et al., 2011) (Figure S2H), and high levels of
tumor cell proliferation (marked by Ki67, Figure S2I).
It has been previously shown that KPC tumor cells express
the ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2 (Stromnes et al., 2014). When
we examined the expression of CXCR2 and its ligands in
tumors from KPC mice we found that, similar to human tumors, Cxcl2 and Cxcr2 were significantly upregulated in
PDAC compared with normal pancreas, while there was also
increased expression of Cxcl1 and Cxcl5 in a proportion of

the tumors (Figure 2A). To determine the source of ligand
production we performed qPCR on RNA prepared from lasercapture micro-dissected tumor epithelium and stroma. Cxcl1,
Cxcl2, Cxcl5, and Cxcr2 transcripts were quantified in these
samples relative to wild-type (WT) pancreas. This demonstrated increased expression of Cxcl2 and Cxcl5 by tumor cells
(Figure 2B). Similar to human tumors, Cxcr2 was highly expressed by stromal cells, likely neutrophils, and some tumor
cells (Figure 2B), and this was confirmed by IHC (Figure 2C).
Indeed, previously published work has shown that there is significant infiltration of granulocytes into KPC tumors (Clark et al.,
Cancer Cell 29, 832–845, June 13, 2016 835

2007), and these are likely the CXCR2-expressing cells that
we observe. In addition, we found that KPC tumor cells in
culture secreted substantial amounts of CXCL1 and CXCL5,
and smaller amounts of CXCL2 (Figure 2D). Finally we
analyzed expression of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl5, and Cxcr2 by
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of FAP+ fibroblasts isolated from
normal pancreas, PanIN, and PDAC from KPC mice (Feig
et al., 2013). Expression of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl5 was
increased in FAP+ fibroblasts from PanIN and PDAC compared
with WT (Figure 2E). CXCL1 expression by stromal fibroblasts
was confirmed by co-IHC for CXCL1 and a-SMA (Figure
2F). CXCR2 was expressed at negligible levels in FAP+ fibroblasts, and, compared with normal controls, was unchanged
in PanIN and PDAC (Figure 2E). The expression we did
observe was likely due to contamination by a very small number of neutrophils, given that we observe similar levels of
MPO (Figure 2E). Our results show that KPC mice recapitulate
the microenvironment and upregulated CXCR2 signaling seen
in human PDAC, and represent an ideal model in which to
investigate the role of CXCR2 signaling in pancreatic cancer.
Cxcr2 Deletion Abrogates Metastasis in KPC Mice
We generated KPC Cxcr2 / mice, which were born at the expected Mendelian ratios and exhibited normal pancreatic pathology. There was no difference in overall or tumor-free survival
between KPC Cxcr2 / and KPC mice (Figure 3A), which initially
suggested that CXCR2 was neither tumor suppressive nor tumor
promoting in this system. To investigate whether inhibition
of CXCR2 signaling might affect response to chemotherapy
in pancreatic cancer, we treated mice with gemcitabine from
10 weeks of age. At this time mice have widespread advanced
pancreatic neoplasia (Hingorani et al., 2005; Morton et al.,
2010), and are more likely to mimic non-metastatic surgically
resectable disease. Using this timepoint also allowed us to
monitor effects of drugs or combinations over a longer period
of time. This was crucial given recent studies that have generated contrasting results depending on the timing of intervention
(Olive et al., 2009; Rhim et al., 2014). However, it is important to
note that pancreata at this stage will exhibit mostly pre-invasive
disease with occasional progression. Nevertheless, we did not
detect any significant impact of gemcitabine treatment on
survival in either KPC or KPC Cxcr2 / mice (Figure 3A).
There were no clear histological differences between tumors
in KPC and KPC Cxcr2 / mice; however, we found that Cxcr2
deletion was sufficient to almost completely abrogate metastasis (Figures 3B–3F). Unsurprisingly, gemcitabine had no significant effect on metastases in the KPC model (Figure 3B). IHC of
immune cell infiltrate in pancreatic tumors from KPC and treated
and untreated KPC Cxcr2 / mice showed that, as expected,
given the role of CXCR2 in neutrophil homing, there was a significant reduction in the number of MPO+ cells infiltrating tumors
lacking CXCR2 (Figures 3G, 3H, and S3A). Interestingly, this
was accompanied by a significant increase in F4/80+ macrophages and CD3+ T cells in the KPC Cxcr2 / tumors (Figures
3G, 3H, S3B, and S3C), and a significant decrease in expression
of the pro-invasive protein tenascin C (Figures 3G, 3H, and S3D).
There were also fewer proliferative cells in the KPC Cxcr2 /
tumors, but no difference in the levels of apoptosis, as assessed
by cleaved caspase 3 IHC (Figures S3E and S3F). We also found
836 Cancer Cell 29, 832–845, June 13, 2016

a decrease in picrosirius red staining indicating a reduction in
collagen I expression (Figure S3G).
Recently, we performed integrated genomic analysis of 456
human PDAC that defined four subtypes of PC that are associated with distinct histopathological characteristics and differential survival (Bailey et al., 2016). Based on a number of key
molecular characteristics, these subtypes have been named:
(1) squamous; (2) pancreatic progenitor; (3) immunogenic; and
(4) aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX). The
squamous subtype is an independent prognostic factor and
is associated with poor outcomes. To further investigate the
role of CXCR2 in PDAC progression we set out to assess
whether loss of CXCR2 was significantly associated with a specific PDAC subtype. This analysis clearly demonstrated that
CXCR2 loss is associated with an apparent switch from the
poorly prognostic squamous identity commonly observed in
KPC tumors, and an enrichment of gene expression that defines
the pancreatic progenitor, immunogenic, and ADEX subtypes
(Figures 3I and 3J). These data are in line with our finding that
Cxcr2 deletion inhibits metastasis, and provide further evidence
of a role for CXCR2 signaling in promoting aggressive pancreatic cancer.
Depletion of Ly6G+ Cells Recapitulates the Effects of
Cxcr2 Deletion
Ly6G+ cells, including neutrophils and MDSCs, are the most
prominent source of CXCR2 in mice (Cacalano et al., 1994).
Thus, we considered whether depletion of these cells would
recapitulate the phenotypes that arise as a consequence of
Cxcr2 deletion. The anti-Ly6G antibody 1A8, has been routinely
used to deplete Ly6G+ cells, and is well-tolerated and effective
long term (Jamieson et al., 2012). KPC mice were treated from
10 weeks of age with 1A8 or 2A3 isotype control. Compared
with 2A3-treated mice, and like Cxcr2 deletion, 1A8 treatment
had no effect on survival (Figure 4A), but did result in strong suppression of metastasis (Figure 4B), indicating that the CXCR2dependent recruitment of Ly6G+ cells is indeed important in
the establishment of secondary disease. As expected, the primary tumors of 1A8-treated mice contained fewer MPO+ neutrophils than tumors from 2A3-treated mice and, importantly, 1A8+
cells were also reduced even at endpoint in both tumor and
spleen (Figures 4C–4F), suggesting that treatment remains
effective even if some antibody neutralization may occur.
F4/80+ macrophage infiltration did not change, but, like Cxcr2
deletion, the depletion of Ly6G+ cells resulted in a marked increase in the number of infiltrating CD3+ T cells (Figures 4C–
4E), supporting previous work (Stromnes et al., 2014). Thus,
depletion of Ly6G+ cells, the dominant cell type expressing
CXCR2, has a similar effect to Cxcr2 deletion, namely inhibition
of metastasis, and substantial changes in the immune cell profile
of tumors, most notably a loss of MPO+ neutrophils and a
marked increase in CD3+ T cells.
Although these data suggest that Ly6G+ cells mediate the effects of Cxcr2 deletion, others have reported a pro-tumorigenic
role for CXCR2 signaling in pancreatic tumor cells (Purohit
et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013). To confirm that the effects of
Cxcr2 deletion were not mediated by effects on autocrine tumor
cell signaling we deleted Cxcr2 specifically from the pancreatic
epithelium of KPC mice using a conditional floxed Cxcr2 allele

(KPC Cxcr2fl/fl). Importantly, we did not see any effect on survival
(Figure 4G), and we no longer observed any effects on metastasis or CD3+ T cell infiltration (Figures 4H and 4I), confirming
that the effects of Cxcr2 deletion are not dependent on the
loss of expression on the tumor cells.

CXCR2 Inhibition Reduces Metastases and Prolongs
Survival in KPC Mice
Although anti-metastatic therapies may not inhibit growth of
the primary tumor, they may be useful in patients where the primary tumor can be resected. Thus, we wanted to determine if
Cancer Cell 29, 832–845, June 13, 2016 837

pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 signaling could inhibit
metastasis in the KPC model. To inhibit CXCR2, we first used
a short peptide CXCR2 ‘‘pepducin’’ (1/2i-pal), which inhibits
CXCR2 signaling by interfering with its ability to couple to intracellular signal-transduction molecules (Jamieson et al., 2012;
Kaneider et al., 2005). Control mice received a scrambled pepducin. Other groups of KPC mice received gemcitabine alone,
or gemcitabine along with the CXCR2 pepducin. All treatments
were started when the mice were 10 weeks old. CXCR2 pepducin treatment resulted in a significant increase in survival
compared with controls and appeared to reduce metastasis
(Figures 5A and 5B). Gemcitabine alone had no effect on survival
or the development of metastasis, but when CXCR2 pepducin
and gemcitabine were combined, survival was significantly
extended and we were unable to detect any metastases in these
animals (Figures 5A and 5B). We did not see significant changes
in neutrophil, macrophage, or CD3 infiltration in pepducintreated mice (Figures 5C, 5D, and S4A–S4C), although the number of infiltrating neutrophils was significantly higher in mice
treated with the combination of CXCR2 pepducin and gemcitabine (Figure S4A), which may be due in part to necrosis within
these tumors. Indeed, tenascin C, the expression of which is
induced by hypoxia (Lal et al., 2001), was upregulated in pepducin-treated tumors (Figures 5C, 5D, and S4D). There was no
significant change in either tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis
(Figures S4E and S4F), but again we saw a decrease in picrosirius red staining indicating a reduction in collagen I (Figure S4G).
CXCR2 Inhibition Results in Failure to Set up a
Metastatic Niche
Given the profound effect that inhibiting CXCR2 signaling has on
metastasis in our model, we sought to examine potential mechanisms for this phenomenon, particularly in distant metastatic
sites. MDSCs are immature bone marrow cells typified by the
expression of CD11b, Gr1, and Ly6G/Ly6C (Youn and Gabrilovich, 2010). They have been shown to play a role in establishing
the metastatic niche in different metastatic tumor models (Acharyya et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2010). Therefore, we investigated the
levels of these, and other immune cells, in the pre-metastatic
livers of KPC mice (Figure S4H), in KPC liver metastases (Figure S4I), in the livers of KPC mice treated with pepducin and
gemcitabine from 10 weeks old (Figure S4J), and in liver metastases from KPC mice treated with CXCR2 pepducin and gemcitabine when symptomatic (Figure S4K). We included this latter
group because of the lack of metastases in KPC Cxcr2 /
mice and mice with CXCR2 inhibited from 10 weeks.
We found that there were a substantial number of F4/80+ macrophages, NIMP1+ neutrophils, and cells staining positively with
the MDSC marker, S100A9, in the pre-metastatic liver (Figure S4H), and in established liver metastases where there were
also CXCR2-expressing cells (Figure S4I). CXCR2 inhibition
with pepducin considerably decreased the number of myeloid
cells in the livers of KPC mice (Figure S4J) and, even in mice
with late-stage tumors, reduced the number of neutrophils and
S100A9+ cells infiltrating liver metastases, although had no effect
on monocyte/macrophage recruitment (Figure S4K). Interestingly, the number of CD3+ T cells infiltrating these metastases

mary tumors and metastases following CXCR2 inhibition suggest that the migration of myeloid lineage cells to the tumor
microenvironment is impaired when CXCR2 signaling is suppressed. This reduction in chemotaxis may also result in a failure
of myeloid cells to migrate to the liver and establish a niche for
tumor cells. These findings suggest a key role for CXCR2
signaling and immune cell migration in metastatic progression
in this model.
Clinically Relevant Targeting of CXCR2 Reduces
Metastases and Prolongs Survival in KPC Mice
The finding that CXCR2 inhibition but not constitutive knockout
could slow tumorigenesis suggested that CXCR2 might play
opposing roles in early and late tumorigenesis. Loss during initiation might allow pre-neoplastic PanIN lesions to progress
beyond senescence, while loss at late stages might inhibit the
growth and metastatic potential of PDAC. Thus, we wanted to
further test the therapeutic effects of CXCR2 inhibition at a later
stage of neoplasia, using a clinically relevant CXCR2 inhibitor.
Therefore, we tested the effects of AZ13381758, a small-molecule inhibitor of CXCR2 (referred to as CXCR2 SM) that is related
to AZD5069 (Nicholls et al., 2015). AZ13381758 is a potent inhibitor of both murine and human CXCR2 (Figures S5A–S5F, Table
S1), the efficacy of which was confirmed by full blood-count
analysis showing increased circulating neutrophils due to their
inability to home (Figure 6A).
Similar to CXCR2 pepducin, treatment with CXCR2 SM alone
from 10 weeks of age prolonged the survival of KPC mice, and
was most effective in combination with gemcitabine (Figure 6B).
In addition, mice treated with CXCR2 SM were significantly protected from metastasis (Figure 6C). We did not observe significant changes in the number of intra-tumoral neutrophils or
macrophages (Figures 6D, 6F, S5G, and S5H), similar to pepducin treatment; however, we did observe an increase in infiltrating
T cells (Figures 6D, 6F, and S5I), similar to the results seen in KPC
Cxcr2 / mice. We also saw a reduction of tenascin C (Figures
6D, 6F, and S5J), a reduction in the number of proliferative cells
(Figure S5K), no change in apoptosis (Figure S5L), and a reduction in stromal collagen (Figure S5M) in CXCR2 SM-treated
tumors. Thus, like Cxcr2 deletion or Ly6G+ cell depletion, pharmacological inhibitors of CXCR2 can reduce the metastatic
spread of pancreatic tumors in KPC mice and may provide a
survival advantage over control animals. More significantly, the
combination of CXCR2 inhibition and gemcitabine treatment extends the life span of KPC mice by 50–70 days and substantially
suppresses metastasis.
CXCR2 Inhibition Substantially Enhances Sensitivity to
Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy
There is a growing awareness that immunosuppression by infiltrating immune cells plays an important role in the resistance
of tumors to endogenous anti-tumor immune responses as
well as therapeutic interventions. Pancreatic cancer cells themselves actively contribute to immune suppression through
production of cytokines (Beatty et al., 2011), so that although
a systemic anti-tumor immune response is elicited, it is ineffective (Dodson et al., 2011). The efficacy of therapy in PDAC
would likely be improved by overcoming this immune suppression. Indeed, immunotherapy aimed at harnessing endogenous

anti-tumor immunity has shown promise in multiple tumor types
(Sharma and Allison, 2015). Given that Cxcr2 deletion or inhibition increased the number of CD3+ T cells in pancreatic tumors
in KPC mice, we wanted to know if CXCR2 inhibitors could
enhance sensitivity to therapies aimed at de-repressing T cells.
We chose to use anti-PD1 antibodies, which block T cell suppression by preventing interactions between PD1 and its ligands
(Barber et al., 2006; Fife et al., 2009), but which have previously
been found to be ineffective as a single agent in this model
(Winograd et al., 2015).
In this experiment, treatment was only started once the KPC
mice had developed palpable pancreatic tumors. One group of
mice then received CXCR2 SM for 2 weeks to increase T cell infiltration into the tumor. Control mice received either vehicle alone
or gemcitabine alone. After this initial priming phase, animals in
the CXCR2 SM and vehicle groups received anti-PD1 antibody
while continuing on the CXCR2 SM or vehicle treatments. Unsurprisingly, given that they are carrying late-stage tumors,
few vehicle-treated animals survived long enough (2 weeks) to
allow commencement of PD1 treatment (Figure 7A). Remarkably, however, even in these late-stage tumors, treatment with
CXCR2 SM and anti-PD1 significantly extended survival beyond
that of the mice treated with vehicle plus anti-PD1, with two mice
living 100 days beyond the start of treatment before succumbing
to pancreatic tumors (Figure 7A).
When tumors from mice at endpoint were examined by IHC for
Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) we observed a reduction in
proliferation following CXCR2 SM + anti-PD1 treatment (Figures
7B and 7C), but no change in apoptosis (Figures 7D and 7E),

although both tumor cells and cells of
the microenvironment may contribute to
this phenotype. Analysis of the tumors by
flow cytometry confirmed the presence
of an increased percentage of CD3+
T cells in CXCR2 SM + anti-PD1-treated
tumors following 2 weeks of treatment
(Figure 7F). We were able to show by
both IHC (Figure 7G) and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Figure 7H) that the number
of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was increased in CXCR2
SM-treated mice and, importantly, the number of inhibitory regulatory T cells was actually reduced (Figure 7H). Interestingly,
in vehicle-treated mice a substantial proportion of both CD4+
and CD8+ T cells exhibited an effector memory phenotype
(CD62L CD44+). In contrast, in CXCR2 SM-treated mice, this
population was less abundant, and a greater proportion of the
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed a naive T cell phenotype
(CD62L+CD44-) perhaps allowing for increased intratumoral
T cell priming (Figure 7I).
Collectively, our data show that in KPC mice, Cxcr2 deficiency, Ly6G+ cell depletion, or pharmacological inhibition of
CXCR2 suppresses metastasis in PDAC, and that CXCR2 inhibitors enhance response to chemotherapeutics and immunotherapy to prolong survival. These results suggest that CXCR2
targeting might have therapeutic efficacy in the pre-metastatic
setting, and may provide an opportunity for immunotherapy in
pancreatic cancer.
DISCUSSION
The outcome for patients suffering from PDAC remains dismal
(Siegel et al., 2015), and it is clear that improvements in pancreatic cancer treatment are required. Here, we show that CXCR2
signaling in the myeloid compartment is tumor promoting and
required for pancreatic cancer metastasis, and in the notoriously
therapy-resistant KPC model of pancreatic cancer we highlight
therapeutic opportunities: Not only does inhibition of CXCR2

prevent metastasis; it also augments the efficacy of immune
checkpoint inhibitors by allowing T cell infiltration. Indeed,
when we compare our mouse tumors with human tumors, we
find that Cxcr2 deletion is associated with a switch away from
the poorly prognostic squamous identity (Bailey et al., 2016).
Our data support other studies linking inflammation and
metastasis (Colotta et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2009) and suggest
that inflammatory signaling molecules may be excellent targets
in the neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer. A number
of key inflammatory pathways, including IL-6/STAT3, NF-kB,
and COX2 pathways, have already been shown to be key in
the process of PDAC progression and metastasis (Corcoran
et al., 2011; Daniluk et al., 2012; Fukuda et al., 2011; Lesina
et al., 2011; Ling et al., 2012). Indeed, patients with significant tumor-associated inflammation have a poor prognosis following
surgery (Jamieson et al., 2005).
It has been suggested that pancreatic tumors metastasize
prior to the development of a detectable mass in the pancreas
(Haeno et al., 2012; Rhim et al., 2012). However, we found that
whether CXCR2 signaling was targeted by genetic or pharmacological means, alone, or in combination with chemotherapy,
metastasis was significantly inhibited. The ameliorated recruitment of immature myeloid cells to metastatic sites suggests
that CXCR2 functions at multiple stages of the metastatic pro-

cess, hence the striking effect on metastases seen following
genetic knockout. In addition, given that CXCR2 inhibition can
restrict pancreatitis, targeting CXCR2 signaling in cancer may
have additional benefit in terms of ameliorating symptoms
(Steele et al., 2015).
Predicting the outcome of targeting stromal elements within
PDAC has been difficult. Combination of anti-stromal agents
and chemotherapy represents a promising approach to therapy
in this disease, with encouraging findings in studies targeting the
extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan or hyaluronic acid (Jacobetz et al., 2013). On the other hand, recent studies targeting tumor-associated fibroblasts and hedgehog signaling at different
stages of tumorigenesis produced differing results, with accelerated tumorigenesis if treatment was early and improved survival
for late-stage treatment (Olive et al., 2009; Ozdemir et al., 2014;
Rhim et al., 2014). The results we present here suggest that
CXCR2 has stage- and also cell-type-specific roles in PDAC
cancer. During early carcinogenesis, CXCR2 can reinforce
senescence in epithelial cells (Acosta et al., 2008); however,
once the senescence pathway is abrogated, MDSC/neutrophil
CXCR2 drives tumor progression and metastasis. We propose
this as the reason that Cxcr2 deletion had no overall effect on
survival of KPC mice. These findings are consistent with the
expression of CXCR2 in human cancer, which is expressed in

PanINs and more rarely in epithelial tumor cells, but is highly expressed in neutrophils/MDSCs at tumor fronts.
We do find that a subset of human tumors show high epithelial
CXCR2 expression; however, it is unclear what role CXCR2 is
playing in those tumors. Many studies have shown that CXCR2
expression on cancer cells can drive proliferation, invasion,
and migration (Matsuo et al., 2009a, 2009b; Purohit et al.,
2016; Wang et al., 2013). However, our data showing that epithelial cell-specific Cxcr2 loss has no effect on tumor-free survival or
metastasis suggests that the effects we observe in the case
of Cxcr2 deletion or inhibition are not mediated by tumor cell
expression. Together, these findings highlight an intriguing
idea, namely, that tumor cells develop a requirement for autocrine CXCR2 signaling once explanted, as a result of loss
of the paracrine signaling that exists in vivo. This hypothesis
would further underscore the importance of CXCR2 signaling
in pancreatic cancer.
Given that most of the mutations that accompany KRAS
mutation in PDAC have been shown to abrogate growth arrest/
senescence, for example CDKN2A, TP53, and TGFb pathwaytargeting mutations, and the fact that at the time of presentation
tumors are highly proliferative and not senescent, concerns over
treatment of patients with PDAC with CXCR2 inhibitors are
negated. Any remaining concerns are alleviated given the good
efficacy we have seen with combination with gemcitabine or
842 Cancer Cell 29, 832–845, June 13, 2016

anti-PD1. This clearly differentiates CXCR2 inhibition from other
stromal targeting agents such as hedgehog inhibitors.
Among the stromal changes we observed following CXCR2 inhibition, one of the most striking was enhanced T cell infiltration.
This enhanced T cell infiltration may be responsible for the
increased efficacy of gemcitabine, given that enhanced T cell
accumulation in KPC tumors can induce stromal remodeling
(Stromnes et al., 2015), which in turn can increase the efficacy
of gemcitabine (Olive et al., 2009; Provenzano et al., 2012). The
infiltration of T cells also rendered tumors sensitive to immunotherapy with PD1-blocking antibody. There are a number
of possible mechanisms by which CXCR2 inhibition enables
T cell infiltration. For example, we observed a decrease in monocyte/macrophage tumor infiltration in treated mice, and a role for
macrophages in the exclusion of T cells from pancreatic tumors
has been described (Beatty et al., 2015).
Immunotherapy to reactivate anti-tumor immunity has delivered promising results in several tumor types (Sharma and
Allison, 2015), but not, as yet, in pancreatic cancer. Dose
scheduling will be important in future clinical trials, given that
CXCR2 targeting may be most effective when used to prime
the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the anti-metastatic effect
we observe was uncovered when treating mice at an early time
point with mostly pre-invasive disease and, as such, may not
truly reflect the clinical situation. Nevertheless, our results

suggest that inhibiting CXCR2 signaling, and thus recruitment
of myeloid cells, may offer the opportunity for immunotherapy
in pancreatic cancer, even in patients not eligible for resection.
In addition, neoadjuvant targeting of CXCR2 in combination
with standard chemotherapy could provide hope for effective
targeting of disease progression and metastases in resectable
PDAC.

Cytokine Array on Medium Conditioned by KPC Cells
Murine pancreatic cancer cell lines have been described previously (Morton
et al., 2010). AAM-CYT-G2000-4 Ray Biotech slides (Holzel Diagnostics)
were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Laser scanning using
the Cy3 channel was used for detection of protein expression.
In Vivo Treatment Experiments
For drug treatments, mice were randomly assigned to cohorts. Treatments
used were: CXCR2 pepducin (X1/2pal-i3, Genscript) or scrambled pepducin
at 2.5 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection daily; gemcitabine (LC Laboratories)
at 100 mg/kg by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection twice weekly; CXCR2 SM
(AstraZeneca) at 100 mg/kg per os (p.o.) twice daily; vehicle p.o. twice daily;
anti-PD1 (Biolegend) or isotype control at 10 mg/kg by i.p. injection twice
weekly; 1A8 antibody or 2A3 isotype control (BioXcell) at 10 mg/kg by i.p. injection thrice weekly. Efficacy testing of CXCR2 SM is described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed using log rank tests. Assessment of differences in counts between different mice was performed using
non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests. For all boxplots in the paper, boxes depict the middle 50% of the records and the line indicates the median. Whiskers
show the highest and lowest values that are no greater than 1.5 times the interquartile (IQ) range, and asterisks show outliers (cases with values between
1.5 and 3 times the IQ range). Chi-square tests were used to assess the statistical differences in metastasis rate between categorical groups. Spearman’s
rho correlation coefficient method was used to assess correlation. ANOVA
test was used for analysis of qPCR data.
