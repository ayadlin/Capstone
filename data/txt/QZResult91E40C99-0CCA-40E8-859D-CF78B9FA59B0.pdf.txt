ABSTRACT:
With modern advances in robotics and data processing, high-throughput screening
(HTS) is playing an increasingly growing role in the drug discovery process. The
ultimate success of HTS depends upon the development of assays that are robust and
reproducible in miniaturized formats, have low false-positive rates, and can identify
drugs that offer improvements over those currently on the market. One example of
such an assay is the ATAD5-luciferase HTS assay, which identified three antioxidants
that could kill cancer cells without inducing mutagenesis. Here we discuss the ATAD5luciferase assay and expand upon the value of HTS in identifying other potential cancer
drugs, focusing on cell-based assays that involve DNA damage or repair pathways.

INTRODUCTION

closely resembles a natural physiological state; in general,
they are less costly and time-consuming in that they do not
require purification of an active target protein; and they
can immediately select against compounds that cannot
permeate cellular membranes to reach intracellular targets,
thereby eliminating additional validation steps. However,
because they contain more than one target, cell-based
assays may also require more complex secondary screens
than HTS assays that use cell-free systems.
In this manuscript, we discuss the various cellbased HTS assays that have been developed to aid in
the discovery of chemotherapeutic agents, focusing on
those that exploit the DNA damage response. Such assays
include tests for genotoxic agents, assays that utilize
specific DNA repair mutants, and screens for compounds
that can overcome chemoresistance.

High-throughput screening (HTS) is an automated
process that allows for the rapid testing of large chemical,
genetic, or biological libraries. It utilizes 96-, 384-, or
1536-well microplates, robotics, liquid handling devices,
sensitive detectors, and data-processing software to
identify a small number of effectors of a particular
biological mechanism from collections that can contain
up to two million drug candidates or leads. HTS has
increasingly been used by both academic institutions
and pharmaceutical companies to identify diagnostic
biomarkers [1], expedite and reduce the costs associated
with the discovery of new drugs, and screen FDAapproved compounds for additional uses, purposes, and
indications.
HTS requires the development of robust assays
with high signal-to-noise ratios that are adaptable to
small volumes. These assays can be either biochemical
(cell-free) or cell-based. Examples of biochemical
assays include fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS),
fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (FIDA),
and in vitro transcription assays [2]. Examples of cellbased assays include RNAi [3], second messenger, cell
proliferation, and reporter assays [4]. Cell-based assays
have several advantages over biochemical assays: they
enable screens to be conducted in a context that more

Screening for Genotoxic Compounds
Many chemotherapeutic treatments involve the
administration of genotoxic compounds that damage
DNA to the point of inducing cancer cell death via
well-established DNA damage response signaling
networks. Such genotoxins include alkylating agents
(chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide), platinum drugs
(cisplatin, oxalaplatin), antimetabolites (5-fluorouracil,
methotrexate), anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin),

and topoisomerase inhibitors (topotecan, etoposide), all of
which stall DNA replication, collapse replication forks,
and produce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), resulting
in the apoptosis of rapidly dividing cells [5]. There are
currently several cell-based HTS assays available to
identify genotoxic compounds, including GreenScreen
HC GADD45a-GFP (Gentronix Ltd.), BlueScreen HC
(Gentronix Ltd.), CellCiphr p53 (Cellumen Inc.), and
CellSensor p53-bla (Invitrogen Corp.) [6-8]. However,
cell-based genotoxicity assays are notorious for high
false-negative rates due to lack of metabolic activation
and the removal of genotoxic lesions by the DNA repair
system, and the results generated from the varied screens
often only partially overlap due to differences in genotoxic
mechanism [8]. Thus, there remains a need for new
assays that can be used to discover additional genotoxic
compounds.
To address this need, our laboratory recently
developed the ATAD5-luciferase HTS assay [9], which
exploits the stabilization of the ATAD5 protein following
DNA damage [10]. This assay is robust and reproducible
in a 1536-well plate format and exhibits a high specificity
for genotoxic compounds. Most importantly, in a pilot
screen of approximately 4,000 small molecules, the
ATAD5-luciferase assay successfully identified three
potential chemotherapeutic agents that offer improvements
over conventional cancer drugs. These compounds, the
antioxidants resveratrol, genistein, and baicalein, can kill
rapidly dividing cells without inducing mutagenesis or
chromosomal alterations, side-effects that may make cells
more resilient to cell-cycle checkpoints or apoptosis [9].
Based on the success of this pilot study, we have since
used the ATAD5-luciferase assay to screen a collection
of 300,000 chemical probes from the Molecular Library
Probe Production Centers Network, generating hundreds
of hits that may eventually lead to the production of new
and superior drugs to fight cancer (unpublished data).

(AML) patients [15, 16]; and inherited mutations in
the DNA MMR genes are thought to be responsible for
approximately 5% of the new cases of colorectal cancer
diagnosed each year [17]. Given that DNA repair genes
could be sequenced during tumor biopsies, therapies
that target specific DNA repair mutants may prove to be
extremely beneficial in the era of personalized medicine.
In 2009, Takeda and colleagues reported the
development of DNA-repair-deficient chicken DT40 cell
lines that could be used for high-throughput genotoxicity
screening [18, 19], and by extension, for cancer drug
discovery. The advantages of the DT40 experimental
system are numerous: they have a high efficiency of
targeted integration that allows for the generation of
genetic mutations with relative ease [20, 21], they display
a stable karyotype and short doubling time, they are
unable to completely repair any damage induced in the
G1 phase of the cell cycle, they have an unusually long
S phase, and they grow in suspension [18]. However,
despite the fact that the DNA pathways are well-conserved
throughout evolution, it remains to be seen whether the
results generated from DT40 screens translate to human
systems.
An ongoing project in our laboratory involves the
use of the DNA-repair-deficient chicken DT40 cell lines
in succession with the ATAD5-luciferase HTS described
above. We test the genotoxic compounds uncovered by
the ATAD5-luciferase assay in a high-throughput manner
against a panel of DT40 cells deficient in Polymerase β
(BER), Rev3 (TLS), XPA (NER), FANCC (inter-strand
crosslink repair), Ku70/Rad54 (HR/NHEJ), and ATM
(double-strand break signaling). Because MMR is not
represented in this panel due to the diminished viability
of DT40 cells lacking this pathway, we also test the ability
of the hits from the ATAD5-luciferase assay to selectively
kill a human tumor cell line impaired in the expression of
the MMR protein MSH2. Additional human DNA repairdeficient cell lines are then used in a secondary screen to
validate the compounds that reduced the viability of the
DT40 mutants (unpublished data).

Screening for Compounds that Target Specific
DNA Repair Mutants

Screening for Compounds that Can Overcome
Tumor Chemoresistance

Cancer cells often exhibit deficiencies in one of
the six major DNA tolerance or repair pathways (base
excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER),
mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination
(HR), nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ), and translesion
DNA synthesis (TLS)) that protect cells against the
accumulation of mutations and genomic instability. For
example, 13% of breast cancers [11], 23% of advanced
ovarian cancers [12], 6% of cervical cancers [13], and
4% of non–small-cell lung cancers [14] do not express
BRCA1, a component of the HR machinery; missense
mutations of the FANCA gene, whose protein product
plays a key role in inter-strand crosslink repair, have
been reported in 4-8% of acute myeloid leukemia

The failure of tumor cells to respond to
chemotherapeutic agents presents the largest obstacle
in successful cancer treatment. Drug resistance is
frequently characterized by a cross-resistance to a
number of structurally and functionally distinct agents,
even those to which the tumors have never been
exposed [22]. The primary mechanism by which tumor
cells develop a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype
involves changes in the expression of transporters that
regulate intracellular drug concentrations. Most notable
among these transporters is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a
582

170 kDa member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
superfamily of drug efflux pumps that is known to export
several classes of anti-cancer drugs including vinca
alkaloids, anthracyclines, taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins,
camptothecins, and anthracenes [23-26].
The discovery of ABC transporters and the
establishment of MDR hamster, mouse, and human cell
lines [27-30] led to enormous efforts beginning in the
1980s to generate inhibitors that could be used to reverse
chemoresistance. Unfortunately, many of these firstthrough fourth-generation compounds performed poorly
in clinical trials due to low bioavailability, unexpected
secondary physiological effects, and unanticipated drugdrug interactions [31-33]. To address these shortcomings,
several groups have designed HTS assays using human
MDR cell lines to aid in the discovery of novel inhibitors
of P-gp and other ABC transporters. The screening assays
range from simple cytotoxicity assays to more complex
fluorescence-based assays that utilize labeled substrates
[34] or cell lines [35], and have successfully identified
several putative reversal agents including mometasone
furoate [36], NSC23925 [37], NSC77037 [38], pimozide,
acacetin and loxapine [34]. In addition, the ATAD5luciferase assay revealed two compounds, resveratrol and
genistein, that were ultimately shown to selectively kill
a P-gp overexpressing KB cell line [9]. Although there
is one manuscript that reports an interaction between
genistein and the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of
mouse P-gp [39], no biochemical experiments have ever
been conducted to directly test the interaction between
resveratrol and P-gp.
Another mechanism that has been implicated in
chemoresistance is increased DNA damage tolerance or
repair [22], which is often seen following treatment with
the genotoxic drugs discussed above [40]. Consequently,
several biochemical HTS assays have been carried out to
search for inhibitors of the many different DNA repair
factors, including­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ PARP-1 [41], Ape1 [42], RecA [43,
44], and Rad51 [45] . In addition, efforts are currently
underway in our laboratory to identify inhibitors of the
TLS polymerase Polη and the DNA damage response
protein ATAD5 using cell-based HTS assays (unpublished
data). The assay for Polη inhibitors is based on the
observation that polη/polζ deficient chicken DT40 cells,
which can tolerate various genotoxic stresses, become
sensitive to DNA damaging agents when complemented
with human Polη [46]. The screen for ATAD5 inhibitors
utilizes the ATAD5-luciferase cell line [9], and is based on
the premise that cells with reduced levels of the ATAD5
protein are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents [10].

of drug efflux pumps and DNA repair factors. Despite the
incredible number of new therapeutic options that have
been and will continue to be made available through
HTS, many impediments to effective cancer treatment
still remain: the efficacy of genotoxic agents is limited
by their toxicity to normal tissues, the multifactoral
nature of chemoresistance negates any benefit obtained
by overcoming a single resistance mechanism, and
the functional redundancy of the different DNA repair
pathways can reduce the effectiveness of repair enzyme
inhibitors. Thus, the next challenge will be to determine
how the DNA damaging agents, repair inhibitors, and P-gp
modulators identified using the assays described above can
be used in combination with each other to achieve the best
therapeutic outcome.
