Abstract
Cancer cells exhibit an altered metabolic phenotype known as the aerobic
glycolysis. The expression of HK2 changes the metabolic phenotype of cells to support
cancerous growth. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of
resveratrol on HK2 expression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell glycolysis.
Aerobic glycolysis was observed in four HCC cell lines compared to the normal hepatic
cells. Resveratrol sensitized aerobic glycolytic HCC cells to apoptosis, and this effect
was attenuated by glycolytic inhibitors. The induction of mitochondrial apoptosis
was associated with the decrease of HK2 expression by resveratrol in HCC cells. In
addition, resveratrol enhanced sorafenib induced cell growth inhibition in aerobic
glycolytic HCC cells. Combination treatment with both reagents inhibited the growth
and promoted apoptosis of HCC-bearing mice. The reduction of HK2 by resveratrol
provides a new dimension to clinical HCC therapies aimed at preventing disease
progression.

Introduction

hexokinase 2 (HK2) contributes to this process [3].
The first important irreversible step of glycolysis
is catalyzed by HKs, which phosphorylate glucose to
glucose-6-phosphate. Four HK isozymes have been
identified in mammals and are known as HK1, 2, 3,
and 4 [4]. HK1 and HK2 bind to the mitochondrial
voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) through their
hydrophobic N terminal. Disruption of the binding of
HK with VDAC causes mitochondrial dysfunction and
induces cell death [5]. In human carcinomas, including
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HK2 is highly expressed

One of the metabolic features of tumor cells is
the aerobic glycolysis, by which tumor cells, even in
the presence of sufficient oxygen, activate glycolysis
and convert pyruvate to lactate acid rather than totally
oxidizing it by Krebs cycle [1]. Therefore, glycolysis, the
major pathway for energy production, is pivotal for the
survival and growth of cancer cells [2]. The mechanisms
underlying the shift from the Krebs cycle to glycolysis
in cancer cells are well studied, and it is believed that

to produce more energy to support accelerated growth
[6]. The upregulated mitochondria-bound HK2 in tumor
cells, as well as the high glucose phosphorylation activity,
promote tumor cell proliferation and survival by enhancing
energy production and the escape from mitochondriaassociated cell death [7]. Therefore, HK2 in particular, is
regarded as a potential target for anticancer therapy, and
the screening of drugs that suppress HK2 expression and
prevent metabolic transformation becomes meaningful [5].
Resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a
dietary polyphenol derived from grapes, berries, peanuts,
and other sources [8]. Resveratrol has anticancer activity
at multiple stages of tumor development and progression,
and it has minimal toxicity to normal cells. The chemopreventive effect of resveratrol has been shown in a
variety of cancer cell lines, including HeLa, A549, and
MCF-7 cells [9, 10]. Previous studies have proposed
different mechanisms to explain the anti-proliferative
effect of resveratrol, including the upregulation of tumor
suppressor genes such as BRCA1/2 [11] and p53 [12],
and the phosphorylation of Rb and transcription factors
such as AP-1 and NF-kB [13]. Resveratrol was recently
suggested to inhibit cellular survival through SIRT1associated AMPK activation [14]. Resveratrol is also
known to inhibit mTOR, which is one of the central
metabolic integrators [15, 16]. In addition, resveratrol can
suppress glycolysis by inhibiting PI3K signaling, blocking
the cell cycle in B cell lymphomas [17]. However, the
effect of resveratrol on the expression of HK2 during
the metabolic transformation of HCC cells has not been
analyzed to date. In the presented study, we show that the
metabolic phenotype of HCC cells is characterized by
glucose to lactate conversion and suppressed oxidative
activity. Resveratrol inhibits glycolysis and induces
apoptosis in HCC cells. Further investigation of the
underlying mechanism showed that resveratrol inhibits
HK2 expression and activates mitochondria-associated
apoptosis. In addition, resveratrol improved the resistance
of aerobic glycolytic HCC cells to the multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib, the only clinically effective drug that
can slightly prolong the survival of HCC patients. The
results of the present study suggest that improving our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effect
of resveratrol on tumor proliferation and metabolism may
help identify more effective treatments for patients with
HCC.

conditions for 72 h. Glucose uptake and lactate production
were compared between HCC cell lines showing
heterogeneity in cellular metabolism (Fig. 1A and 1B).
The concentration of lactate in the cell culture supernatant
was significantly higher in HCC-LM3, SMMC-7721, and
Bel-7402 cells than in QSG-7701 and LO2 cells. The
concentration of lactate was slightly increased in HepG2
cells compared to QSG-7701 and LO2 cells (P < 0.05).
In addition, the cellular glucose uptake was markedly
potentiated in HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells compared
with QSG-7701 and LO2 cells, (834 vs. 602 pmol/mg/min
of 2-DG, respectively). Glucose uptake was slightly higher
in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells than in QSG-7701 and
LO2 cells, whereas Huh-7 cells showed no glucose uptake
changes in lactate production and glucose uptake. These
results indicate that HCC cell lines show an increased rate
of aerobic glycolysis compared to healthy cells.
Our data showed that glycolysis was used as a
bioenergetic pathway in more than 80% of our tested HCC
cell lines. The first rate-limiting step is the conversion of
glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) during aerobic
glycolysis catalyzed by HK, which is the key mediator
of glucose metabolism. Therefore, HK2 expression was
assessed by western blotting in two healthy liver cell lines
and five HCC cell lines (Fig. 1C and 1D). At least four
of HCC cell lines (HCC-LM3, Bel-7402, SMMC-7721,
and HepG2) expressed HK2, whereas Huh-7 and normal
liver cells did not. HK2 was expressed exclusively in the
high-glycolytic HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cell lines, but
not in the low-glycolytic Huh-7 cell line. Based on these
results, HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells, which showed the
highest aerobic glycolysis rate of all the HCC cell lines
tested, were selected as typical inherent aerobic glycolytic
HCC cell lines with high HK2 expression, and Huh-7 was
selected as a representative low-glycolytic HCC cell line,
showing low glucose to lactate conversion. These cell
lines were used for subsequent experiments.
In tumor cells, the aerobic glycolysis is generally
correlated to decreased oxygen consumption, which results
from disrupted oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
capacity in mitochondria [25]. We therefore tested
byproducts of OXPHOS metabolism and O2 consumption
to determine whether representative high- and lowglycolytic HCC cell lines showed differences in OXPHOS
capacity and oxygen consumption (Fig. 1E and 1F).
Consistent with our hypothesis, OXPHOS metabolismcorrelated proteins, denoted as complexes I/II/III/IV/V
in the electron transport chain, were markedly decreased
in the representative aerobic glycolytic HCC cell lines
(HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402), showing approximately 2.5fold lower levels than in the low-glycolytic HCC cell
line (Huh-7) and healthy cells (QSG-7701 and LO2).
Moreover, O2 consumption, which reflects the level of
OXPHOS metabolism, was lower in representative aerobic
glycolytic HCC cells (HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402) than in
the other cells examined (Fig. 1F).

µM of resveratrol, whereas a concentration of 80 µM was
required to achieve the same effect in Bel-7402 and Huh7 cells (Fig. S1). These results indicate a window for the
selective resveratrol-induced cell apoptosis in HCC cells.
In addition, resveratrol enhanced the apoptosis-induced
functions in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells.
We next examined whether resveratrol induced
cell death was correlated to the inhibition of glycolysis.
We hypothesize that glycolysis inhibitors may attenuate
the growth inhibitory effects of resveratrol on aerobic
glycolytic HCC cells. HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells
were treated with resveratrol in the presence or absence
of 2-DG, a synthetic glycolysis inhibitor. Resveratrol
effectively suppressed the growth of both 2-DG- and
2-DG+ cells (Fig. 2E and 2F), although the inhibitory
effect of resveratrol was stronger in 2-DG- than in 2-DG+
cells, suggesting that cells with a high glycolysis rate are
more sensitive to resveratrol. Moreover, 3-bromopyruvate
(3-BP), a pyruvate analog that acts as a specific glycolysis
inhibitor through a different mechanism of action than
2-DG [30], also attenuated the cell proliferation inhibitory
effects of resveratrol in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells
(Fig. S2A and S2B). Alternatively, the immunoblotting
experiments further demonstrated the signiificant
reduction of resveratrol induced active caspase-3 and
cleaved PARP in both HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 receiving
the 2-DG (Fig. 2G) and the 3-BP (Fig. S2C). Taken
together, these results indicated that resveratrol inhibited
cell growth partly through reducing glycolysis in both
HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells.

Because resveratrol suppresses aerobic glycolysis
in several cancers, including breast and ovarian cancers
[26, 27], we examined the ability of resveratrol to induce
similar changes in HCC cell lines. Our data showed
that resveratrol (20 µM) treatment of HCC-LM3 cells
significantly decreased the concentration of lactate in the
cell culture supernatant (P = 0.018) compared to that in the
untreated control. Bel-7402 cells treated with resveratrol
(40 µM) showed significantly lower lactate concentration
(P = 0.012) than the untreated control group. Moreover,
increasing doses of resveratrol decreased lactate
concentration in the cell culture media in both the HCCLM3 and Bel-7402 cell lines (Fig. 1G).
HCC-LM3 cells treated with resveratrol (40 µM)
showed significantly lower (P = 0.008) glucose uptake
(541 pmol/mg/min) than the untreated control (901 pmol/
mg/min). In Bel-7402 cells, resveratrol (20 µM) also led
to markedly lower (P = 0.031) glucose uptake (524 pmol/
mg/min) compared to the untreated control (668 pmol/mg/
min; Fig. 1H). By contrast, resveratrol treatment did not
change the lactate level and glucose uptake of the lowglycolytic Huh-7 cell line (Fig. 1G and 1H).

Resveratrol inhibits proliferation and induces
apoptosis partly by suppressing HCC glycolysis
Resveratrol-suppressed glycolysis in tumor cells
leads to the inhibition of proliferation in multiple cancers
[27, 28]. Therefore, we examined the effect of resveratrol
on the proliferation of HCC cell lines. After resveratrol
treatment for 24 h, cell proliferation rate was significantly
inhibited in a dose dependent manner in HCC-LM3, Bel7402, and Huh-7 cells, albeit to varying degrees (Fig.
2A). The IC50 of resveratrol for the inhibition of cell
proliferation in HCC-LM3, Bel-7402, and Huh-7 cells
was 59.46, 81.57, and 111.37 µM, respectively (Fig. 2A).
In addition to the inhibition of cell proliferation, a
major effect of resveratrol treatment is the induction of
apoptosis in various types of cancer cells [26, 27, 29].
Therefore, we investigated whether resveratrol treatment
induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Annexin-V propidium
iodide double staining (Annexin-V/PI staining) indicated
that resveratrol induced apoptosis in HCC-LM3, Bel7402, and Huh-7 cells in a dose dependent manner,
albeit to varying degrees (Fig. 2B-2D). Resveratrol at a
concentration of 40 µM significantly induced apoptosis
in HCC-LM3 cells compared to untreated cells, whereas
concentrations above 80 µM were required to achieve a
similar effect in Bel-7402 and Huh-7 cells. Consistent
with the apoptosis staining results, western blotting
revealed a significant upregulation of active caspase-3
and cleaved PARP in HCC-LM3 cells treated with 40

HK2 is essential for resveratrol-suppressed HCC
glycolysis and proliferation
To examine the mechanism underlying the effect
of resveratrol on promoting cell death by inhibiting
glycolysis in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells, we measured
the effects of resveratrol on the expression of several key
glycolytic enzymes, including GLUT1, HK2, PKM2,
PFK1/2, and LDH-A in HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells by
qRT-PCR. Among them, HK2 mRNA level was decreased
the most in both HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells treated
with 80 µM resveratrol (Fig. 3A and 3B). Immunoblotting
results indicated that HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells treated
with resveratrol for 24 h showed a significant decrease
in HK2 protein expression in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 3C-3E). Importantly, fractionation assays
further indicated that in HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells,
mitochondrial HK2 was downregulated in response to 24
h of resveratrol treatment, consistent with the pattern of
total HK2 (Fig. 3C-3E). Analysis of the potential effect
of resveratrol on other glycolytic proteins showed that at
a dose of 40 µM, resveratrol downregulated the protein
expression of PKM2 in HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells
(Fig. 3C-3E), suggesting that resveratrol may inhibit

4H-4J). Moreover, Pastorino JG, et al has identified that
Bax oligomerization on mitochondria can be attenuated
by upregulating mitochondrial binding HK2 [34].
Consistent with their conclusion, by compared to the
resveratrol group, we found the significant reduction of
Bax oligomerization on mitochondria upon combination
treatment with resveratrol and Lenti-HK2 (Fig. 4H and
4I). Alternatively, the expressions of the antiapoptotic
protein Bcl2 and Bcl-xl were not altered on mitochondria
in both resveratrol and resveratrol combining Lenti-HK2
groups (Fig. 4H, 4K and 4L). These results indicate that
resveratrol induced mitochondrial apoptosis in aerobic
glycolytic HCC cells through the downregulation of
HK2, which probably contributed to the activation and
oligomerization of Bax on mitochondria.

glycolysis at a broad level in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells.
HKs are the first important irreversible enzymes
of glycolysis, and the upregulation of mitochondriabound HK2 in tumor cells promotes cell proliferation
and escapes from mitochondria-associated cell death
[3, 7, 31]. Therefore, we examined whether resveratroldownregulated HK2 is essential for resveratrol-inhibited
glycolysis in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells. HCC-LM3 and
Bel-7402 cells stably overexpressing HK2 (Fig. S3A and
S3B) were treated with resveratrol, which significantly
attenuated its inhibitory effect on glucose uptake. The
inhibitory rate of resveratrol was suppressed from 43.17%
and 42.51% in empty vector (EV) groups to 20.44% and
16.83% in HK2 overexpressing groups, respectively.
Analysis of lactate levels showed that the inhibitory effect
of resveratrol on lactate production was also reduced
in HK2 overexpressing groups compared to the EV
groups, with inhibitory rates of 50.85% and 37.76% vs.
18.48% and 9.61%, respectively (Fig. 3F and 3G). The
cell proliferation rate in HK2 overexpressing-HCC-LM3
and -Bel-7402 cells decreased by 34.48% and 21.68%,
respectively, upon 80 µM resveratrol treatment for 24 h
(Fig. 3H). These results indicated that HK2 is essential
for resveratrol-inhibited glycolysis and proliferation in
aerobic glycolytic HCC cells.

Resveratrol enhances sorafenib induced cell
growth inhibition in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
Our results suggested that resveratrol induces
apoptosis and inhibits cell growth via glycolysis inhibition
in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells (Fig. 2). Shen et al
recently reported that the aerobic glycolysis contributes
to sorafenib-resistance in HCC cells, and resistance
can be overcome by inhibiting tumor glycolysis [35].
Therefore, we determined whether combination treatment
with resveratrol and sorafenib, the only effective antiHCC drug in clinical practice, had an effect on cell
metabolism and cell proliferation in HCC cell lines. The
five HCC cell lines tested showed different IC50 values
for sorafenib (range: 3.10–20.75 µM; Fig. S4A and S4B).
Among them, the two high-glycolytic HCC cell lines
HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402, displayed the highest IC50 for
sorafenib, which was consistent with the conclusions of a
previous report [35]. These cells were regarded as typical
sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. HCC-LM3 cell viability
was significantly suppressed in response to combination
treatment with resveratrol (20 µM) and sorafenib (5 µM)
compared with resveratrol or sorafenib alone (Fig. 5A).
Consistent with the above results, combined resveratrol
and sorafenib (40 and 5 µM, respectively), also markedly
decreased the percent of viable Bel-7402 cells compared
to the untreated cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 5B).
On the basis of the in vitro results, we further
investigated the anti-HCC activity of resveratrol in nude
mice bearing liver orthotopic tumor implants generated
by transplantation of glycolytic HCC-LM3 cells. We
also determined the combination effects of resveratrol
and sorafenib. Mice treated with resveratrol (10 mg/kg/
BW/day) or sorafenib (10 mg/kg/BW/day) alone showed
a significantly smaller tumor diameter than untreated
mice after 30 days of treatment (2.03 ± 0.35, 1.58 ± 0.27
vs. 2.84 ± 0.56, P = 0.026, P = 0.002, respectively; Fig.
5C and 5D). Alternatively, resveratrol combined with
sorafenib significantly suppressed tumor size compared

HK2-overexpression in aerobic glycolytic HCC
cells attenuates resveratrol-induced mitochondrial
apoptosis
We next examined the mechanism by which
resveratrol induced apoptosis through the downregulation
of HK2 in HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells. Resveratrol at
a concentration of 80 µM and combined with Lenti-HK2
significantly attenuated resveratrol-induced apoptosis in
HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells (17.44% and 21.35% for
combination vs. 46.91% and 39.03% for resveratrol alone,
respectively) by inhibiting the activation of caspases 3
and 9 (Fig. 4A-4D). In HK2-overexpressing cells treated
with resveratrol, Δψm was significantly increased by
39.1% and 29.7% in HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells,
respectively, compared to cells treated with resveratrol
alone (46.3% and 49.7%; P < 0.01, respectively; Fig. 4E4G). The reduced depolarization effect of Δψm in HK2overexpressing groups was consistent with a decrease in
cytosolic cyt c released from mitochondria to the cytosol
(Fig. 4H, 4M and 4N). Additionally, because Bax and/or
Bak has been demonstrated to form channels on the outer
mitochondrial membrane (OMM) during mitochondrial
apoptosis [32, 33], we further tested the subcellular
localization of Bax and Bak by immunoblotting using
cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. We found that
in resveratrol (80μM) treated group, Bax translocated
to mitochondria, while the expression of Bak was not
changed in both HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402 cells (Fig.

growth inhibition in aerobic glycolytic HCC cell lines and
combination treatment with both reagents significantly
inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis compared
with sorafenib alone.

the resveratrol-inhibited aerobic glycolysis was correlated
to cell growth inhibition.
Previous studies have indicated that the reduced
glucose uptake induced by resveratrol is the result of
decreased glucose transporter expression in lung, breast
and leukemic cell lines [36, 37]. However, in the present
study, resveratrol had no effect on GLUT1 mRNA
expression in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells (Fig. 3).
The mechanism underlying the suppression of glucose
uptake by resveratrol in HCC cells displaying the aerobic
glycolysis remains to be elucidated.
Mitochondria-bound HK2 has been shown to
be associated with apoptosis and the escape from
mitochondrial cell death in several types of cancer [3,
7, 31]. In the present study, we examined the effect of
resveratrol on HK2 correlated glucose metabolism and
cell function in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells. Resveratrol
treatment had no significant effect on key glycolytic
enzymes, such as GLUT1, PFK1/2, and LDH-A (Fig. 3).
Although PKM2 was reduced in response to resveratrol,
which was consistent with previous research [28], our
results also suggested that HK2 is essential for resveratrol
correlated metabolic changes and cancer cell growth and
apoptosis (Fig. 3 and 4). The present study is the first
to indicate that such a mechanism exists in resveratrolinhibited aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in HCC
cells. Moreover, HK2-overexpression in aerobic glycolytic
HCC cells significantly attenuated resveratrol-induced
mitochondrial apoptosis, as indicated by the inhibition of
the loss of Δψm and cytochrome c release (Fig. 4).
Sorafenib is the only chemotherapeutic drug that
has been shown to be effective in prolonging the survival
of HCC patients. However, the low rate of tolerance to
sorafenib among HCC patients limits its use [38, 39].
Since several studies have reported that the aerobic
glycolysis leads to chemotherapy resistance [40, 41] and
glycolysis, which is a potential predictive biomarker of
sorafenib resistance [35], is used to overcome sorafenib
resistance, we investigated whether inhibition of
glycolysis by resveratrol in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells
enhances the effect of sorafenib. Two high-glycolytic HCC
cells, HCC-LM3 and Bel-7402, showed the highest IC50
for sorafenib among all the HCC cells examined, which
was consistent with the conclusions of a previous report
[35]. Resveratrol in combination with sorafenib inhibited
the proliferation of the HCC cell lines HCC-LM3 and Bel7402. Furthermore, resveratrol enhanced the ability of
sorafenib to reduce the size of tumors in hepatoma-bearing
nude mice. These findings are in agreement with previous
studies showing that resveratrol can enhance the effect of
5-fluourouracil in colorectal carcinoma [42], clofarabine in
malignant mesothelioma [43], ursolic acid in skin tumor
cells [44] and tiazofurin in leukemia cells [45].
The present study is the first to investigate the
mechanism of resveratrol in glycolysis through the
downregulation of HK2 using different HCC cell lines

Discussion
In the present study, we showed that the aerobic
glycolysis, which is characterized by enhanced lactate
production and glucose uptake, occurred in the majority
of the HCC cell lines examined. Resveratrol inhibited
cell growth and induced apoptosis by promoting a
metabolic shift away from glycolysis in aerobic glycolytic
HCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that resveratrol
downregulates the expression of HK2, a key regulator of
tumor glycolysis, which could result in metabolic stress
associated apoptosis. The results of the present study
showed that resveratrol enhances sorafenib induced cell
growth inhibition in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells, and
when combined with sorafenib, it increases the in vivo
effects of sorafenib.
Since the glycolysis can be activated under hypoxic
conditions, we hypothesized that HCC cells may not
display glycolysis when cultured under normoxic
conditions. However, we found that under normoxic
conditions, 80% of examined HCC cells displayed the
aerobic glycolysis, as indicated by increased lactate
production and glucose uptake and decreased oxidative
capacity. A low glycolysis in an HCC cell line indicates
that either glycolysis is not activated under normoxic
conditions or other metabolic pathway, such as oxidative
phosphorylation rather than glycolysis, is functional.
Our results indicate that glycolysis might influence HCC
development, and identify a reagent with few side effects
capable of inhibiting the aerobic glycolysis that could be
an effective therapy for the treatment of HCC.
In the present study, we showed that resveratrol
inhibited glycolysis in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells, as
indicated by decreased lactate production and glucose
uptake. At the lowest concentration of 20 µM, resveratrol
reduced glucose uptake and lactate levels; however,
this dose did not significantly suppress the proliferation
rate or promote apoptosis, suggesting that glycolysis
inhibition by resveratrol in high-glycolytic HCC cells
occurs before the inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis
induction. In addition, glycolytic inhibitors reduced the
sensitivity of aerobic glycolytic HCC cells to the antiproliferative effects of resveratrol (Fig. 2), suggesting that

and an HCC-bearing mouse model. HCC is an incurable
disease and it is urgent to find new chemotherapeutic
options; therefore, it is important to test the potential
value of resveratrol in combination with other classic
chemotherapeutic drugs such as sorafenib. Our results
suggest that resveratrol in combination with sorafenib
significantly inhibits the growth and induces apoptosis
of HCC-transplanted mice compared to sorafenib alone,
providing preclinical evidence of the potential value of this
drug for the treatment of HCC. Although the in vivo doses
of resveratrol used in our study were high, resveratrol
is not toxic at high doses in humans [46]. Therefore, in
the near future, the prognosis of sorafenib-resistant HCC
patients could be improved through the application of the
treatment strategy proposed in the present study.

MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, 5 mM L-alanine,
5 mM indomethacin, and 10 mM HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4),
cells were cultured in uptake buffer containing 1 µCi/mL
[3H]-2-DG at 37°C for 30 min. After 30 min, the cells or
tumor tissues were solubilized by 0.1% Sodium Dodecyl
Sulfate (SDS) and the radioactivity was counted using a
liquid scintillation counter. The radioactivity counts for
each sample were then normalized to the protein level and
corrected for the zero-time uptake per mg protein. Lactate
levels were measured by a fluorometric assay (BioVision,
Milpitas, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. O2 consumption was tested using the 110 Fiber
optic oxygen monitor (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA).
Approximately 5 million cells were collected in 500 µl
of media and cultured at 37°C. Results were tested in
three independent experiments and displayed as nmol O2/
million cells/min.

Materials and Methods

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR)

Reagents and cell culture
Resveratrol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Sorafenib tosylate was purchased from
Selleck (Selleck Chemicals, Shanghai, China). For cell
treatment, the compounds were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then
diluted in media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) before use.
All cultured cells were purchased from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences Committee Type Culture Collection
cell bank. HCC-LM3, Huh-7, HepG2, SMMC-7721, Bel7402, and LO2 were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Hyclone)
supplemented with 10% FBS. QSG-7701 was cultured
in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2.

The Trizol reagent was used to extract total RNA
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA
(2,000 ng) in each sample was used to generate cDNA
using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase with Oligo (dT)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The real-time PCR experiment was performed
following the protocol of the real-time PCR kit (Takara,
Dalian, China) [18-19].

Western blot analysis
The cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions
were separated and purified from HCC cells using a
Mitochondrial Isolation Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol [20].
Total cellular proteins were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (SigmaAldrich). For reducing gel electrophoresis, equal amounts
of samples were added to each lane. The samples were
then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinyl
difluoride membranes. The membranes were sequentially
blocked with 5% defatted milk, and incubated overnight
with the following primary antibodies: β-actin (A2228)
(1:2,000; Sigma-Aldrich); HK2 (#2867) (1:1,000; Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass); PARP (133711-AP), Bax (23931-1-AP), Bak (14673-1-AP), Bcl2 (12789-1-AP) and Bcl-xl (10783-1-AP) (1:500;
Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL); active-caspase 3
(ab32042), active-caspase 9 (ab2324), cytochrome c (cyt
c) (ab13575), and hsp-60 (ab46798) (1:1,000; Abcam, San
Francisco, CA). The OXPHOS cocktail (MS604) (1:250;
Mitoscience, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) was used
against the following proteins: NDUFB8 of complex I (20

Cell proliferation analysis
HCC cells were cultured with the indicated
concentrations of resveratrol for 24 h before the addition
of 10 μl CCK-8 solution (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka,
Japan) to each well. The plate was maintained in the
incubator for 4 h. The absorbance was measured at 450
nm using a microplate reader. The IC50 values were
calculated using CompoSyn software using the absorbance
data obtained with a microplate reader Model 680 (BIORAD, Hercules, CA).

kD), SDHB of complex II (30 kD), UQCRC2 of complex
III (48 kD), MTCO1 of complex IV (40 kD), ATPSA of
complex V (55 kD). The LI-COR ODYSSEY scanner
(LICOR) was used to detect the antigens on the blots.

Four-week-old male athymic BALB/C nu/nu mice
with free access to water and food were housed in a
standard animal laboratory with a 12-h light-dark cycle
and constant environmental conditions. All experiments
were performed in accordance with ethical standards
and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki,
and according to national and international guidelines.
The study was approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Shanghai Tongji University. Serum-free
culture medium (300 µl) containing HCC-LM3 cells
(5×106) was subcutaneously injected into the upper
flank region of three mice. After one week, 1.0 mm3
subcutaneous tumor tissue was placed in the livers of
other mice as described previously [21-23]. Twenty mice
were randomly divided into four groups, namely vehicle,
resveratrol, sorafenib, resveratrol+sorafenib. Resveratrol
was suspended in DMSO and diluted with physiological
saline containing 1%DMSO. Mice in the resveratrol
group were treated by intraperitoneal injection once daily
for 30 days with resveratrol (10 mg/kg) dissolved in
1%DMSO/saline solution. Thus 1%DMSO/saline served
as an intraperitoneal vehicle. Sorafenib was dissolved
in an oral vehicle containing Cremophor EL (SigmaAldrich), 95% ethanol and water in a ratio of 1:1:6 as
described previously [24], and orally administrated at
a dose of 10 mg/kg by gavage daily for 30 days. Mice
in the vehicle group received oral and intraperitoneal
vehicles; mice in the resveratrol group, oral vehicle and
intraperitoneal resveratrol; mice in sorafenib group,
intraperitoneal vehicle and oral sorafenib; and mice in
resveratrol+sorafenib group, intraperitoneal resveratrol
and oral sorafenib. During this time, mice were weighed
every 5 days. At the end of the experiment, the mice were
killed by cervical dislocation. Livers were resected and
imaged using a high-definition digital camera.

Annexin-V/PI staining
HCC cells were cultured in six-well plates and
treated as indicated. After 24 h, the cells were centrifuged,
washed twice with PBS, and mixed in 100 µl of 1×
binding buffer (10mM HEPES/NaOH, PH7.4, 140mM
NaCl, 2.5mM CaCl2). After culturing for 15 min at room
temperature in Annexin-V/PI (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) double staining liquid, the cells were examined by
flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500; Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA). The percentage of apoptotic cells was
calculated using ModFitLT software.

mitochondrial

Cells were plated on coverslips with different
treatments overnight. After staining with 10 µg/ml JC-1
(JC-1 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Detection Kit;
Invitrogen) for 15 min in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2),
cells were rinsed with HBSS twice to remove the nonspecific background staining. Cells were analyzed using
a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and cells emitting
a bright red fluorescence represented the aggregate
mitochondria.

Plasmid construction, lentivirus packaging and
infection
To construct the lentivirus vector pCDH-HK2
expressing HK2, a full-length cDNA encoding the HK2
sequence was amplified from 293T cDNA and then cloned
into the EcoR I/BamH I sites in the pCDH-CMV-MCSEF1-GFP vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View,
CA). Control lentiviral vector was used as a control. All
plasmid sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Lentivirus was generated by co-transfecting pCDH-CMVMCS-EF1-GFP empty vector or pCDH-HK2 in 293T cells
with Lipofectamine™2000 (Invitrogen). Target cells were
infected overnight with empty vector or pCDH-HK2 in
the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich).
The following day, the cells were given fresh medium
and allowed to grow for another 48 h. The transduction
efficiency was measured by western blotting. The sorted
cells were then characterized and used in further assays.

TUNEL assay
Apoptosis of tumor tissues was assessed using
the TUNEL assay. Paraffin-embedded sections (5 µm)
were cut and mounted on glass slides. The sections
were deparaffinized and then digested with 20 µg/
mL proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room
temperature. The slides were washed 4 times in distilled
water for 2 min, incubated with 2% hydrogen peroxide
in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, washed with
PBS twice and immersed in TdT-containing buffer for
15 min to prepare digoxigenin-binding sites. An antidigoxigenin antibody fragment carried a conjugated
reporter enzyme (peroxidase) to the reaction sites, and
then localized peroxidase generated an intense signal
from the chromogenic substrate diaminobenzidine. The
counterstain was methyl green.
