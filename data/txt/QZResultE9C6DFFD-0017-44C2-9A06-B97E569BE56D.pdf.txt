BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE); however, its effect on venous
thromboembolism (VTE) remains controversial. Scant data exist on the factors that increase the risk of ATE/VTE in patients with
prostate cancer. The authors investigated the association of bevacizumab treatment and clinical factors with ATE/VTE risk in patients
who were treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 90401. METHODS: Patients with metastatic, castration-resistant
prostate cancer were randomized to receive docetaxel and prednisone with or without bevacizumab once every 21 days. Cycle-toevent Cox regression models were used to investigate the association of bevacizumab with the incidence of grade 3 or greater (3)
ATE and VTE. Age, prior ATE/VTE, baseline antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, and VTE risk score (based on leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, body mass index, and tumor location) were evaluated in univariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Of 1008
randomized patients, the odds of experiencing grade 3 ATE were significantly greater in those who received bevacizumab compared with those who received placebo (odds ratio, 2.79; P 5 .02), whereas an opposite trend was noted for grade 3 VTE (odds ratio, 0.60; P 5 .08). In the multivariable analysis, bevacizumab treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 3.00; P 5 .01) and age (HR, 1.06; P 5 .02)
were significantly associated with the risk of ATE; whereas age (HR, 1.05; P 5 .01) and VTE risk score (HR, 1.83; P 5 .03) were significantly associated with the risk of VTE. CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab was significantly associated with a greater risk of ATE in
patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, but it was not significantly associated with the risk of VTE. Understanding clinical factors that increase the risk for experiencing ATE/VTE is essential to mitigate the risks and reduce the burden of these

INTRODUCTION
Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is currently
approved to treat metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and nonsquamous nonsmall
cell lung cancer.1-5 Although bevacizumab is generally well tolerated, common adverse drug events include hypertension and
proteinuria, whereas rarer, more serious events include hemorrhaging and gastrointestinal (GI) perforation.6-10
Patients with cancer are approximately 4 times more likely to experience a thromboembolism than those without
cancer.11 Clinical manifestations comprise arterial thromboembolism (ATE), including cardiac and cerebrovascular ischemia, and venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The risk factors

for ATE and VTE are distinct. Whereas the risk of ATE is
increased by treatment with certain chemotherapeutic
agents,12 the risk of VTE may be increased by a variety of
factors, such as chemotherapy and specific tumor types,
including prostate cancer,13 and by several patientspecific factors, including prior history, age, mobility, and
diet.14 Attesting to the array of influences on VTE is a predictive VTE risk score proposed and validated by Khorana
et al that incorporates cancer site, hemoglobin, platelet
count, leukocyte count, and body mass index (BMI) to
stratify patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, or highrisk categories for developing a VTE.15
Bevacizumab has been associated with an increased
risk of ATE. However, its effect on VTE remains controversial.8,9,16-19 A meta-analysis reporting an increased
VTE risk with bevacizumab treatment17 was refuted by 2
subsequent large pooled analyses.8,19
The objective our current report was to elucidate
the influence of bevacizumab treatment and patientspecific factors on the risk of grade 3 or greater (3)
ATE and VTE through Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) (Alliance) trial 90401,20 a previously
reported, large, randomized phase 3 study in patients
with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer who
received docetaxel and prednisone with or without bevacizumab. Summary incidence rates from that trial suggested an increased rate of grade 3 ATE and a
decreased rate of grade 3 VTE in bevacizumab-treated
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

CALGB 90401 was a double-blinded phase 3 trial that
randomized men with castration-resistant prostate cancer
1:1 to docetaxel and prednisone with and without bevacizumab.20 All eligible patients were enrolled and treated on
the CALGB 90401 study and provided institutional
review board-approved, protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. Briefly, patient eligibility included histologically
documented, castration-resistant, progressive adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Relevant exclusion criteria included
prior chemotherapy or antiangiogenic therapy, an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2,
evidence of brain metastasis, congestive heart failure,
uncontrolled hypertension, a GI bleed within the past 6
months, a GI perforation within the past 12 months,
history of an ATE within the past 12 months, serious
nonhealing ulcers or wounds, or grade 2 peripheral
neuropathy.

Treatment

All patients received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as an intravenous
infusion over 1 hour on day 1 of each 21-day cycle with
oral dexamethasone before the docetaxel infusion plus
oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Patients were equally
randomized to receive bevacizumab 15 mg/kg or placebo
as an intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle
and were treated until disease progression, death, or a
treatment-terminating adverse event occurred, for up to a
maximum of 2 years of treatment. Stable doses of anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, were
allowed. Bevacizumab or placebo was immediately discontinued for grade 4 hypertension, reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome, recurrent ATE, grade 2 ATE,
grade 3 hemorrhages or bleeding from any cause, GI perforation, wound dehiscence, or nephrotic syndrome.
Toxicity and Risk Factor Data Collection

Toxicity data were collected prospectively by the Alliance
Statistics and Data Center at each treatment cycle on
standardized forms that mandated reporting of all grade
3 toxicities as defined by the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, Version
3.0. For this analysis, an ATE included any grade 3 cardiac ischemia/infarction or central nervous system ischemia,
whereas VTE included any grade 3 thrombosis/thrombus/
embolism. Medical history was collected on standardized
prestudy forms that included documentation of prior
ATE (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral
vascular disease, arterial thrombosis, transient ischemic
disease, and cerebrovascular accident) and prior VTE.
Baseline antiplatelet/anticoagulant use was recorded along
with dose and frequency. A validated predictive risk score
for the incidence of VTE developed by Khorana et al15
based on site of cancer (prostate, categorized as low risk),
baseline platelet count (350,000/lL), hemoglobin
(<10 g/dL), leukocyte count (>11,000/lL), and BMI
(35 kg/m2; all of which were collected prospectively)
was used to classify patients into low-risk (zero risk factors), intermediate-risk (1-2 risk factors), or high-risk (3
risk factors) categories for developing a VTE.
Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint was time (cycle) to the event of interest (ATE or VTE). The analyses for this endpoint were
carried out under a competing-risks model in which the
event of interest was subject to 3 dependent, informative
censoring mechanisms: progression/death, other
treatment-terminating adverse events, or “other reasons,”
such as loss to follow-up, withdrawal for reasons other

than toxicity, or incomplete information (Table 1).
Patients who did not complete 2 years of therapy because
of any of these competing risks before they experienced the
event of interest were informatively censored at the cumulative bevacizumab cycles received. Given the competing
risks, the time-to-event analyses were conducted on the basis of a cause-specific hazard for the influence of each covariate on the event of interest (VTE or ATE). A
multivariable Cox regression model21 was used to adjust
for baseline covariates, including age (continuous, per
year), prior ATE or VTE (yes vs no), baseline antiplatelet/
anticoagulant use (yes vs no), and VTE risk score (VTE
analysis only; low risk vs intermediate/high risk according
to the Khorana model15). Cumulative incidence plots were
constructed to observe the influence of bevacizumab treatment on the risk of ATE and VTE. Fisher exact tests22 were
used to assess baseline differences between bevacizumabtreated and placebo-treated patients. No adjustment for
multiplicity testing was performed. Statistical analyses were
conducted by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center on a
data set that was locked on January 28, 2014.

between bevacizumab-treated and placebo-treated patients

experienced grade 3 ATE, and 58 patients experienced
grade 3 VTE. Table 1 describes the number of patients

Patients

The CALGB 90401 study randomized a total of 1050
patients, of whom 1008 received treatment (503 men
received docetaxel, prednisone, and bevacizumab; 505 men
received docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo). The median
duration of therapy for both arms was 8 cycles. The median
age for the entire cohort was 69 years. Approximately
68.2%, 31.1%, and 0.5% of patients were categorized as
low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk based on the validated VTE risk score. The intermediate-risk and high-risk
categories were collapsed for the univariate and multivariable analysis because of the low number of high-risk
patients. At study entry, most patients (59.5%) were using
aspirin, a different antiplatelet, or an anticoagulant,

compared with placebo-treated patients (HR, 0.60; 95%
CI, 0.35-1.02; P 5 .06). Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative incidence of grade 3 VTE by treatment cycle stratified according to treatment arm. The incidence of grade

Covariate Analysis

In the cause-specific univariate analysis, prior ATE (HR,
2.95; 95% CI, 1.23-7.06; P 5 .02) and increasing age
(HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P 5 .02) were significantly
associated with grade 3 ATE, whereas only increasing age
(HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P 5 .01) was significantly
associated with grade 3 VTE. A trend was noted between
the VTE risk score and increased VTE risk (HR, 1.67;
95% CI, 0.99-2.82; P 5 .054) in the univariate analysis. It
is noteworthy that prior VTE was not associated with the
risk of developing grade 3 VTE (HR, 0.91; 95% CI,
0.22-3.73; P 5 .89), and baseline antiplatelet/anticoagulant use was not associated with the risk of developing grade
3 ATE (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.58-2.94; P 5 .51) or VTE
(HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.46-1.3; P 5 .33).

mab (HR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.25-7.19; P 5 .01) and
increasing age (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P 5 .02)
remained significant for an association with increased risk
of grade 3 ATE, whereas prior ATE no longer met statistical significance (HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 0.93-5.68; P 5 .07).
Both increasing age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; P 5

CI, 0.38-1.12; P 5 .13), were significantly associated with
the risk of grade 3 VTE in the multivariable model.
DISCUSSION
Our analyses confirmed previous data indicating that
patients who received bevacizumab were at a significantly
greater risk of experiencing grade 3 ATE compared with
patients who received placebo. The incidence of grade 3
ATE among patients who did and did not receive bevacizumab (3.8% and 1.4%, respectively) is consistent with
the rates from a previously reported pooled analysis of
1745 patients with metastatic cancer (data for
bevacizumab-treated patients with prostate cancer were
not previously available) of 3.8% and 1.7% in the bevacizumab and control populations, respectively.8
In univariate analysis, a potential protective effect of
bevacizumab on the risk of VTE was identified. The VTE

The validated risk score was developed by Khorana et al15 for VTE analysis only. Patients were categorized as either low risk, intermediate risk, or
high risk if they had 0, 1 to 2, or 3 risk factors (hemoglobin <10 g/dL, platelet count 350,000/lL, leukocyte count >11,000/lL, body mass index
35 kg/m2), respectively. Prostate as the site of cancer was categorized as
low risk (zero points). Because there were only 5 high-risk patients, the
intermediate-risk and high-risk categories were collapsed.

bevacizumab-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively, are lower than those reported (10.9% and 9.8%,
respectively) in a prior pooled analysis; however, the incidence rates of grade 3 VTE vary greatly across tumor
types and treatment regimens (range, 1.2%-13.6%).19 A
prior analysis of 6055 patients reported lower rates of
VTE in bevacizumab-treated patients when adjusted by
exposure and proposed that patients who receive bevacizumab may experience better tumor control, resulting in
decreased tumor-related complications, such as VTE. In
CALGB 90401, the patients who received bevacizumab
had superior progression-free survival, prostate-specific
antigen response, and objective response but did not have
superior overall survival.20 Because VTE is a well documented tumor-related complication,14 it is possible that
the tumor control benefit of bevacizumab treatment partially explains the suggested protective effect on VTE.
Given the lack of data on clinical risk factors associated with ATE and VTE in patients with prostate cancer,
we assessed the influence of baseline covariates on the risk
of ATE and VTE.
In multivariable analysis, bevacizumab treatment
and increasing age were statistically significant predictors

of increased ATE risk, whereas there was a trend toward
an increased risk in patients with prior ATE. These data
are consistent with a previously reported pooled analysis
by Scappaticci et al.8
Alternatively, both increasing age and VTE risk
score had statistically significant associations with an
increased risk of VTE. A previously published pooled
analysis by Hurwitz et al19 demonstrated that age, prior
VTE, and coumarin use at baseline were associated with
increased VTE risk. It is possible that the relatively low
number of patients with prior VTE events reported in our
population prevented the replication of this finding. Only
a minority of baseline antiplatelet/anticoagulant users
were receiving coumarins, which also may have prevented
the replication of similar findings. However, to our
knowledge, our report is the first to validate the VTE risk
score15 in a homogenous cohort of patients with 1 tumor
type from a randomized phase 3 study using a competingrisks model. It is noteworthy that accounting for age and
VTE risk score further abrogated the apparent protective
effect of bevacizumab on the risk of VTE.
Our approach of using a competing-risks model
accounted for informative intervening events that may interfere with the observed event of interest. By definition, the informative censoring approach and removal of patients from
being subject to the event of interest (ie, ATE/VTE) will
result in a lower cumulative incidence.23 Failure to account
for informative censoring may result in a falsely overestimated
cumulative incidence, which may be substantial when the
competing-risk event is related to the underlying disease.24
Use of this method allowed for a more principled interpretation of ATE and VTE risk compared with previous studies,
which generally have used the traditional Kaplan-Meier
approach and may have overestimated the risk.
Although bevacizumab does not have a standard role
in current prostate cancer treatment paradigms,20 these
findings still have clinical applicability both within and
beyond this tumor type. Bevacizumab is used in the firstline setting for many other tumor types, underscoring the
need to understand the adverse event profile of this agent,
in particular its influence on rates of rare but severe
adverse events like ATE. In addition, our report provides
the first known analysis of the covariates that influence
VTE risk in patients receiving docetaxel and prednisone, a
standard first-line chemotherapy regimen for metastatic,
castration-resistant prostate cancer. Recognizing patients
with prostate cancer who are at high risk for developing
VTE (eg, older patients and those with a higher VTE risk
score) is vital for improving patient safety and identifying
patients for thromboprophylaxis.

guidelines for VTE prophylaxis14 support the VTE risk
score proposed by Khorana et al15 to identify high-risk
patients in the outpatient setting. Although routine
thromboprophylaxis is not currently recommended in
this setting, the balance of benefit and harm with thromboprophylaxis for high-risk patients identified by the
model is currently under study (national clinical trials
NCT00876915 and NCT02048865). Nevertheless, it is
critical that clinicians actively engage patients in discussion about the signs and symptoms of VTE, particularly
those who are at higher risk.
In conclusion, our analysis from a large, prospective
cohort of patients with metastatic, castration-resistant
prostate cancer who received docetaxel and prednisone
with or without bevacizumab confirms the increased risk
of grade 3 ATE from bevacizumab treatment. We
observed that increasing age was significantly associated
with an increased risk of experiencing grade 3 ATE;
whereas increasing age and VTE risk score, but not treatment with bevacizumab, were significantly associated
with an increased risk of experiencing grade 3 VTE.
Understanding the risk factors for ATE and VTE is essential to mitigate the risks and reduce the burden of these
prevalent complications in cancer care.
