ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a bone marrow derived blood cancer where
intercellular communication in the leukemic bone marrow participates in disease
development, progression and chemoresistance. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are
intercellular communication structures involved in transport of cellular contents
and pathogens, also demonstrated to play a role in both cell death modulation and
chemoresistance. Here we investigated the presence of TNTs by live fluorescent
microscopy and identified TNT formation between primary AML cells and in AML cell
lines. We found that NF-κB activity was involved in TNT regulation and formation.
Cytarabine downregulated TNTs and inhibited NF-κB alone and in combination with
daunorubicin, providing additional support for involvement of the NF-κB pathway in
TNT formation. Interestingly, daunorubicin was found to localize to lysosomes in TNTs
connecting AML cells indicating a novel function of TNTs as drug transporting devices.
We conclude that TNT communication could reflect important biological features of
AML that may be explored in future therapy development.

[9–15]. Membrane nanotubes can also be utilized by natural
killer cells for lysis of target cells [16]. These intercellular
structures are also exploited for cell-to-cell transfer by
pathogens [17–23] and evidence for TNT-like structures and
TNTs in vivo has been provided in zebrafish embryos, in
neural crest cells in chick embryos, in adult mouse cornea,
as well as lung cancer biopsies [10, 24–28]. Recently, it
was demonstrated that B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells and mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) formed TNTs involving pro-survival cytokines and
leukemic niche therapy resistance [29].
The exact molecular mechanisms responsible
for TNT formation and regulation still remain elusive,
however, molecules suggested to be important are; M-Sec
(also called B94 or tumor necrosis factor-α inducing
protein 2), the small GTPase RalA and the transmembrane
protein leukocyte specific transcript 1 (LST1) [30, 31].
Here, we intended to study the existence, potential
function and molecular mechanisms involved in TNT

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive
bone marrow derived blood cancer [1–3] where the bone
marrow represents a multi-cellular compartment with
a high level of cell-to-cell communication [4, 5]. The
cellular communication between blood cells and stromal
cells may be exploited by the leukemic cells for increased
survival and resistance to chemotherapy [6, 7]. Tunneling
nanotubes (TNTs) are novel cell-to-cell communication
devices [8] demonstrated to connect a variety of cell types
including primary cells and cancer cells [9, 10]. TNTs are
defined as thin (50-200 nm), F-actin containing plasma
membrane embedded tunnel-like structures (5–100 μm)
that interconnect cells by hovering above the substratum
[8]. TNTs and TNT-like structures have been shown to
transport different cellular cargos, including endocytic
vesicles, mitochondria, lysosomes, prions and oncogenes
such as the H-Ras protein and oncogenic microRNAs

formation.

surface (Figure 2B, arrowhead). The fragility of the TNTs
was illustrated by several fractures (Figure 2C, small
arrows). A knob-like structure was observed in the TNT
(Figure 2C, large arrow), similar to structures previously
described involved in cell-to-cell transport [34].
Time-lapse microscopy (intervals of 30 sec) of OCIAML3 cells was used to examine how these TNTs formed
and we found that they originated from filopodia-like
structures which transformed into TNTs in less than three
minutes (Figure 2D, Supplementary Video 1), a mechanism
for TNT formation consistent with previous reported findings
[8].

RESULTS
TNT formation in primary AML cells
To study the existence of TNTs in primary AML
cells, patient-derived leukemic cells were investigated by
live fluorescence microscopy and TNTs were characterized
according to the definition described in material and
methods. Intercellular connection resembling TNTs were
found in 17 of 19 patient-derived AML cells originating
from peripheral blood and all four bone marrow-derived
samples (Table 1). These intercellular connections
spanned from 10-100 μm and one connection per cell
was most common, however, some cells exhibited more
than one (Figure 1A, P6). To verify that these connections
indeed were TNTs, we confirmed the presence of F-actin,
lack of tubulin and no attachment to the substrate as
demonstrated by an x-z plane image (Figure 1B and 1C).
Also, connections appearing after cell division, resembling
TNTs, called cytoplasmic bridges were excluded by
identification of their characteristic midbody by DIC.
TNTs in peripheral blood-derived primary AML cells were
found at a range between 0-11.5 TNTs/100 cells (Figure
1D, Table 1). TNT numbers in bone marrow-derived AML
samples ranged from 0.33-3.8 TNTs/100 cells (Figure
1D, Table 1) and 3-8 TNTs/100 cells in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from six healthy individuals (Figure
1D). Intercellular structures more than 200 nm in diameter
containing actin and tubulin were frequently observed,
though not included in the TNT quantification.

Molecular mechanisms for TNT formation in
AML cells
The molecular mechanisms behind TNT formation
and TNT-mediated transport are mostly unknown. In
myeloid cells, three proteins; M-Sec, RalA and LST1,
have previously been reported to be central in TNT
formation [30, 31] and we therefore investigated their role
in TNT formation in AML cells. All the five AML cell
lines studied endogenously expressed M-Sec, however,
the TNT abundant OCI-AML3 cell line expressed highest
M-Sec protein levels (Figure 3A). The RalA protein was
highly and similarly expressed in all the AML cell lines
whereas LST1 showed limited protein expression, with
lowest amounts found for the OCI-AML3 cells (Figure
3A). We further examined the subcellular localization
of M-Sec, RalA and LST1 in OCI-AML3 cells by
immunofluorescence. All three proteins mainly localized
to the cytoplasm and LST1 was most prominently
localized to the plasma membrane (Figure 3B). M-Sec was
also found localized to the TNT structure itself and was
often associated with filopodia-like protrusions (Figure
3C, arrow). In the other cell lines, M-Sec, RalA and LST1
mostly localized to the cytoplasm, and only MV4-11 cells
demonstrated evident localization of LST1 to the plasma
membrane (data not shown).
Since four of five AML cell lines expressed limited
TNT numbers (Figure 1E) and variable M-Sec protein
levels (Figure 3A), we sought to examine if induction of
endogeneous M-Sec expression could result in increased
TNT numbers. The A-vitamin derivate all-trans retinoic
acid (ATRA), used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL), has previously been shown to upregulate
M-Sec at the mRNA level alone and in combination
with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) [35]. We therefore
treated the APL cell line NB4 and the two non-APL cell
lines; HL60 and MOLM-13, with TNFα (10 nM) or
ATRA (10 μM) for 24 h separately or in combination.
TNFα treatment increased the M-Sec level in all three
cell lines; ATRA treatment also caused an increase in
M-Sec, most prominent in NB4 cells, however, most
evident was the increase in M-Sec after combining these
two compounds (Figure 3D, Supplementary Figure 1),

TNTs in AML cell lines
Two different AML cell lines have previously been
shown to express TNTs; THP-1 cells, not quantified per
100 cells, but demonstrated used for transfer of calcium
flux and dyes [32] and KG1a cells found to have 13.97
± 3.31 TNTs per 100 cells and shown to transport the
stem cell marker CD133 [33]. To further investigate the
function of TNTs in AML and search for potential key
proteins involved in TNT formation, five distinct AML cell
lines (Table 2) were examined for the presence of TNTs.
However, except OCI-AML3 (7.8 TNTs/100 cells), the
other cell lines expressed low numbers (0.1-0.8 TNTs/100
cells) of intercellular TNT-like structures (Figure 1E,
Table 2). The intercellular structures found connecting
OCI-AML3 cells were further verified as TNTs (Figure
1F and 1G) and cytoplasmic bridges were excluded by
identification of their characteristic midbody (Figure
2A). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed
connections by thin (approximately 100 nm in diameter)
structures between OCI-AML3 cells, not attached to the

as also demonstrated earlier [36]. Treatments caused only
minor changes in RalA protein level in the three cell lines,
whereas a minor increase in LST1 protein levels was
observed in TNFα-treated MOLM-13 cells and in TNFα
and ATRA treated NB4 cells (Figure 3D, Supplementary
Figure 1). TNT numbers were modestly induced by TNFα
treatment, however, the TNFα and ATRA combination,
resulting in the highest increase in M-Sec levels, was not
associated with an additional increase in TNTs (Figure 3E).
Expression of the M-Sec gene is directly induced
by TNFα [37] and in AML cells, the TNFα–NF-κB

pathway is frequently constitutively active correlating with
chemoresistance [38, 39]. In order to further investigate the
role of M-Sec in TNT formation in AML cells, we compared
the basal expression level of the NF-κB p65 protein in
different AML cell lines by immunoblotting. This revealed
that the AML cell lines expressed diverse levels of p65
protein (Figure 4A). Since the TNT and M-Sec abundant
OCI-AML3 cells expressed high levels of the p65 protein
we decided to investigate the effect of the small molecular
NF-кB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 [40]. OCI-AML3 cells were
treated for 24 h with a pre-apoptotic concentration (2.5

protein levels of total p65 and phospho-p65 (Figure 4B).
By immunofluorescence, the p65 and p-p65 proteins mainly
localized to the cytoplasm, but also in a dotted pattern in

the nucleus and BAY 11-7082 treatment did not induce a
change in subcellular localizations, however, a modest
reduction in fluorescence intensity was observed (data not

reduction in the number of TNTs (Figure 4C), however, no
changes in the subcellular localization of M-Sec, RalA or
LST1 were seen, but a minor decrease in M-Sec and an
increase in RalA protein levels were found (Figure 4D,E).
This indicated an involvement of the NF-κB pathway in
TNT formation in OCI-AML3 cells, where an association
with the M-Sec and RalA proteins could not be excluded.
Based on this we further investigated the potential
role of M-Sec and RalA in TNT formation and performed a
knock-down by shRNA against M-Sec and RalA, verified
and quantified by immunoblotting relative to shCtr (Figure

5A, 5B). The efficiency of the knock-down was found to
be approximately 40% for M-Sec and approximately 60%
for RalA, relative to the shCtr. When these cells were
compared with respect to TNT formation, no significant
differences were found (Figure 5C).

with an anthracycline (idarubicin or daunorubicin) [41].
Interestingly, cytarabine has been reported to have a
negative effect on the NF-κB pathway and daunorubicin
a positive [42, 43], it was therefore of interest to study
the effect on TNTs of these drugs separately and in
combination. OCI-AML3 cells were treated for 24 h
with cytarabine in three different concentrations (0.1 µM,
1.0 µM and 10 µM), reflecting in vivo treatment with
low (20 mg/m2. BID), intermediate (200 mg/m2 every
18 h) and high dose (3 g/m2, BID) cytarabine therapy
[44]. Treatment for 24 h with these three concentrations

resulted in a reduction in TNTs, where induction of
cell death was negligible or low (0%, 2% and 10%,
Figure 6A). Cytarabine-treated OCI-AML3 cells did not
indicate any change in M-Sec, RalA or LST1 protein
levels (Figure 6B). Since we found that TNTs in OCIAML3 cells could be formed through filopodia interplay
and the GTPase Cdc42 (22 kDa) has been associated
with filopodia formation, actin remodeling and TNT
formation [30, 45], we investigated the Cdc42 activity in
OCI-AML3 cells, compared to OCI-AML3 cells treated
with cytarabine for 1 h. This was performed by the use

of a GST1-PAK1(p21-activated kinase)-PBD pull-down
assay. Activated Cdc42 (GTP-bound, not GDP-bound)
interacts with a protein binding domain (PBD) at the
N-terminal of PAK resulting in PAK activation and actin
reorganization [46]. OCI-AML3 cells were found to
express the Cdc42 protein and no reduction was apparent
after cytarabine treatment (Figure 6C). Active and
inactive Cdc42 was verified in the pull-down assay by the
use of GTPγS and GDP, however, no active Cdc42 was
found in the OCI-AML3 cells, even after overexposing
(OE) the membrane (Figure 6C). Another GTPase also
interacting with PAK is the Rac1 (also 22 kDa) protein
[46]. Based on this we attempted to incubate the same
membrane with an anti-Rac1 antibody and surprisingly,
bands appeared indicating active Rac1 in the OCI-AML3
cells, however, with no apparent change after cytarabine
treatment (Supplementary Figure 2A). TNTs were then
quantified in three AML patient samples (P10, P11,
P12), with similar molecular characteristics (Table 1),
treated with cytarabine (0.1 µM, 1.0 µM and 10 µM,
24 h) also resulting in a reduction in TNTs, confirming
the downregulating effect of cytarabine (Figure 6D).
A minor reduction in TNTs was also found in PBMCs
obtained from an AML patient (P8, Table 1) at diagnosis
versus day 17 after chemotherapy with cytarabine (days
1-7) and daunorubicin days (1-3) (Supplementary Figure
2B). Treatment of OCI-AML3 cells for 24 h with preapoptotic doses [47] of daunorubicin (100 nM) did not
significantly affect TNT numbers; however, daunorubicin
combined with cytarabine (1 μM) resulted in reduced
TNTs (Figure 6E). The protein levels of M-Sec, RalA
or LST1 did not significantly change within the 24 h of
chemotherapy treatment as analyzed by immunoblotting
(Figure 6F, Supplementary Figure 2C). However, we did
find that cytarabine reduced p65 expression alone and in
combination with daunorubicin (Figure 6G). To further
elucidate the effect of cytarabine and daunorubicin on the
NF-κB pathway, we utilized a NF-κB-GFP-Jurkat reporter
cell line, where NF-κB-dependent GFP expression was
measured by flow cytometry. TNFα treatment (5 ng/
ml), used as a positive control, induced GFP expression,
whereas no significant differences were found following
cytarabine or daunorubicin treatment alone (Figure 6H). In
combination with TNFα treatment; cytarabine alone and in
combination with daunorubicin significantly reduced GFP
expression, whereas no change was found after treatment
with daunorubicin alone (Figure 6H).

fibronectin-coated well and therefore cellular movement
during the time-lapse experiment is inevitable. Because
of this and the extreme fragility of the TNTs during
imaging capturing we did not succeed in generating a
video displaying the TNT transport of daunorubicin. To
investigate the potential transport we therefore utilized the
adherent osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2 previously shown
to have TNT forming capabilities [48]. Images were taken
every 15th sec and daunorubicin was found to be transported
in the TNTs (Figure 7B and Supplementary Video 2). As
an illustration of the fragility of these structures, notice the
longer TNT, indicated by an arrow, being stretched and then
break in comparison to the two shorter TNTs, also indicated
by arrows (Supplementary Video 3).
Since daunorubicin is associated with cellular
membranes and lysosomes [49, 50], and lysosomes
themselves can be transported through TNTs [8], we
labeled OCI-AML3 cells with the lysosomal specific dye
Lysotracker-Green before treatment with daunorubicin for
24 h. Indeed, we found that daunorubicin colocalized with
lysosomes in the OCI-AML3 cells (Figure 7C) whereas
no colocalization was found between daunorubicin and
mitochondria in OCI-AML3-mito-GFP cells (Figure
7D). Strikingly, daunorubicin and Lysotracker-Green
also colocalized within the TNTs connecting OCI-AML3
cells (Figure 8A), demonstrating that daunorubicin can be
transported in TNTs through interaction with lysosomes.
Further, in co-culture experiments between CelltrackerBlue labeled cells (CTB, untreated) and daunorubicin
treated cells (Figure 8B) we found that untreated and
treated cells formed TNTs (Figure 8C). Interestingly,
untreated cells (Celltracker-Blue) that turned daunorubicin
positive, formed TNTs with surrounding untreated cells,
where daunorubicin localized to the TNTs (Figure 8D).
This indicated that untreated cells receiving daunorubicin
were capable of forwarding this drug to neighboring cells.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates for the first time the
presence of TNTs in primary AML samples derived from
peripheral blood and bone marrow. The TNT numbers in
the patient-derived samples showed a greater variation
compared to cells from healthy blood donors. However,
the TNT numbers were in general low as only 3 of total
22 patient samples had TNT numbers above 5 TNTs/100
cells and in 12 of 19 blood-derived patient samples,
TNT numbers were lower than 3 TNTs/100 cells. Also,
17 of these patient samples had a normal karyotype
and interestingly, all patient samples containing FLT3ITD mutations expressed 2.5 or less TNTs/100 cells. In
comparison, the primary samples with NPM1 mutation
[51] only, showed a greater variation. As for the AML
cell lines, all except the NPM1-mutated OCI-AML3 cells,
demonstrated very low TNT numbers. In order to further
correlate TNT numbers and AML associated molecular

in 10 sec we observed that daunorubicin slightly moved

characteristics, additional AML patient samples need to
be included, however, thus far AML cells appear to be
associated with relatively low TNT numbers.
Although, the molecular mechanisms responsible
for TNT formation are not elucidated, a limited number

of proteins that directly or indirectly associate with actin
polymerization have been suggested to be central [52,
53]. These proteins include Myo10, the calcium binding
protein S100A4 and its receptor RAGE in neurons and
astrocytes, and the small GTP binding protein Cdc42,

together with M-Sec, RalA, LST1, filamin and the exocyst
complex, particularly in macrophages, leukocytes and in
an overexpression system in HeLa cells [52, 53]. Since
M-Sec, LST1 and RalA all are expressed in the myeloid
lineage; they were chosen to assess their role in TNT

formation in AML cells. We found that the most TNT
abundant cell line OCI-AML3 also expressed highest
amounts of M-Sec protein. Since M-Sec is induced
by TNFα through a NF-κB site identified in the M-Sec
promoter [37, 40], and ATRA induces mRNA expression

of M-sec through an TNFα independent mechanism in
NB4 and HL60 cells [35]; we used these two compounds
to increase endogenous M-Sec expression in the low
number TNT expressing cells NB4, MOLM-13 and HL60.
TNFα treatment alone did increase TNT numbers slightly;
however, even if TNFα and ATRA increased endogenous
expression levels of M-Sec protein more than additive, no
further increase in TNT numbers were observed. These
results suggested that in AML cells TNFα-induced NFκB activation could play a role in TNT regulation. This
was further confirmed by the use of the NF-κB inhibitor
BAY-117082 which downregulated both NF-κB p65
and phospho-p65 protein expression together with a
pronounced reduction in TNT numbers. We also found a
modest decrease in the protein expression of M-Sec and
an increase in RalA. However, knock-down of M-Sec and
RalA did not appear to have any significant effects on TNT
formation in OCI-AML3 cells and this suggested a role
for the NF-κB pathway in TNT regulation in AML cells.
This was further supported by treatment of AML
cells with the standard induction therapy cytarabine
and daunorubicin [54, 55]. Interestingly, daunorubicin
has been associated with increased NF-κB activation
[42], whereas cytarabine has been demonstrated to
inhibit this pathway [43]. In OCI-AML3 cells and in
three AML patient samples (P10, P11, P12, Table 1) we
observed that cytarabine caused a significant reduction
of TNTs and NF-κB p65 protein expression level, with
again no difference in the protein levels of M-Sec,
RalA or LST1. Daunorubicin treatment alone did not
decrease TNTs, however, in combination with cytarabine
TNTs were reduced to similar levels as with cytarabine
alone. A reduction in TNT numbers was also found in
cells obtained from an AML patient (P8, Table 1) after
treatment with cytarabine and daunorubicin. The effects
on NF-κB by daunorubicin and cytarabine were verified
by treatment of the NF-κB-GFP-Jurkat reported cell line
where basal level NF-κB induction was studied compared
to effects following NF-κB activation by the use of
TNFα. We reproduced the NF-κB downregulating effect
of cytarabine by the use of much lower concentrations
than the ones used by Screenivasan and co-workers also
demonstrating this effect in Jurkat cells [43]. However, we
did not find that daunorubicin significantly activated NFκB at the basal level or further after induction with TNFα
and this could be due to differences in concentrations used
as well as cell types; we used 100 nM daunorubicin in
OCI-AML3 cells and Das & White used from 2-5 μM
in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 [42].
This demonstrated that cytarabine is a NF-κB and TNTdownregulating drug in AML cells.
To further search for molecular mechanisms
associated with these findings, we hypothesized that
the RhoGTPase Cdc42, reported activated by NF-κB
induction and having a central role in filopodia induction
and actin reorganization [56], could be influenced in OCIwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AML3 cells following cytarabine treatment. However,
we were not able to demonstrate the presence of active
(GTP-bound) Cdc42 in the OCI-AML3 cells, indicating
that other RhoGTPases closely linked to NF-κB activation
are involved in TNT formation in these cells [56, 57].
Therefore additional studies are needed to elucidate
the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the TNT
formation in AML cells.
Since daunorubicin itself is fluorescent it could
readily be observed colocalized with lysosomes in OCIAML3 cells. More strikingly, this drug colocalized
with lysosomes in the TNT structure connecting OCIAML3 cells, demonstrating that TNTs could function as
intercellular transport devices of this drug. By the use of
the adherent osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2 and timelapse microscopy, we demonstrated that daunorubicin
was transported through TNTs. This could represent an
approach for AML cells to communicate stress response
to surrounding cells, possibly inducing collateral damage
to the microenvironment.
Recently, Polak and co-workers demonstrated that
B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCPALL) cells signals through TNTs to MSCs, reflecting
the leukemic bone marrow niche, resulting in increased
cytokine secretion which acted pro-survival and was
associated with therapy resistance [29]. This study
suggested that drugs targeting TNT communication could
eliminate leukemic cells and prevent drug resistance.
Our results indicate that TNT communication between
AML cells could be rather limited in cells with FLT3-ITD
mutation suggesting less survival dependency towards
the stromal microenvironment as compared to AML cells
with NPM1 mutation only. Subsequently, we find that
cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment downregulates
TNT numbers, this could represent a contributing factor
for the sensitivity towards induction therapy found for
NPM1-mutated AML. This hypothesis needs to be tested
using co-cultures with AML cells and MSCs similar to the
above described study. In conclusion, TNT intercellular
communication represents a potential mechanism for
chemoresistance that should be examined in future therapy
development.

transducing OCI-AML3 cells with ready-to-use lentiviral
particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-45826-V, sc41842-V, sc-108080) according to provider’s instructions.
Initially, copGFP Control lentiviral particles (sc-108084)
were used to investigate the efficiency of OCI-AML3
transduction using these ready-to-use lentiviral particles.
Post-transduction, cells were selected using 5 μg/
ml puromycin for two weeks, using OCI-AML3 cells
only as a control for puromycin induced cell death, before
verification of shRNA effect by immunoblotting. The OCIAML3 cells were transduced with shM-Sec and shRalA
lentiviral particles separated in time and each transduction
was accompanied by a transduction with shCtr. For the
(n=3) TNT quantification the shCtr cells have been pooled
and represents (n=6). The NF-κB-GFP-Jurkat reporter
cell line was obtained from System Biosciences (SBI). All
media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS,
1% 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% 5 mM (1.0 U/ml) penicillin
and streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich).

from Invitrogen). Cytarabine (Pfizer) and daunorubicin
(Galen Ltd.) were obtained from Western Norway
Pharmaceutical Trust, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and BAY

TNT identification and quantification
A TNT in this study is defined as; a thin straight
structure, ≤ 200 nm in diameter, minimum 5 µm in
length, hovering above the substratum connecting
two cells. TNTs were distinguished from cytoplasmic
bridges, which appear following cell division, by the
lack of a midbody clearly visible by DIC and/or staining
of cellular membranes [59]. 8-well µ-slides (Ibidi) were
pre-coated with fibronectin (10 µg/ml, F2006, SigmaAldrich) for 30 min at 37°C before washed with saline.
About 20 000 cells were seeded per well and incubated
overnight under physiological conditions. For TNT
identification, plasma membranes were stained (8 min
at 37°C) with 1.67 g/ml WGA–Alexa Fluor© 594 or
488 in medium, followed by two gentle washes with
saline or PBS always leaving 100 µl in the well. Cells
were examined live by fluorescent light microscopy
(Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 with AxioVision 4.8.2 or Zen
software) using a 63x oil objective, heat block (37°C)
and standard air conditions. One hundred cells per well
were counted following a fixed counting pattern with
3-5 cells examined per vision field. Number of TNTs
between cells were determined and expressed per 100
cells. The definition of a TNT in the present study
combined with an outline of how they are counted is
illustrated in Supplementary Figure 2D. In this example
ten cells are shown where all structures are located above
the substratum.
Two wells are counted for each condition in each
experiment and experiments were performed three
times or more, if not otherwise noted. Cell viability
was monitored by Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) staining as
described earlier [60].

Primary AML samples
The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local Ethics
Committee (Regional Ethics Committee West, University
of Bergen, Norway). Blood and bone marrow samples
from consecutively diagnosed AML patients with high
peripheral blood blast counts (>7*109/L) were collected
after informed consent and were processed by density
gradient separation (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield, Oslo,
Norway) with >95% leukemic blasts for biobanking as
previously described [58].
The PBMCs were obtained from blood donors at the
Blood Bank at Haukeland University Hospital following
a written consent and isolated by density gradient
separation.

subtraction was used for calculating the ratio relative to
the loading control.

Pull-down assay
The activity of Cdc42 was measured using an active
Cdc42 pull-down and detection kit performed according
to the manufacture’s protocol (16119, Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Briefly, 10-15x106 cells were untreated or
treated with 1 µM cytarabine for 1 h, followed by cellular
lysis using the lyse/wash/binding buffer provided in the kit
after addition of 1x EDTA free inhibitor cocktail (Thermo
Scientific). The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 16
000 x g at 4°C. Protein contents were measured by the
Bradford protein assay. 800 µg protein of each condition
was used for the pull-down with glutathione resin and
agarose beads together with 20 µg GST-PAK1-PBD. The
GTPγS and GDP controls were performed according to
manufature’s protocol. About 30 µl of pull-down samples
were applied onto an SDS-gel and Cdc42 was detected by
immunoblotting using the anti-Cdc42 antibody provided
in the kit.

NF-κB-GFP-Jurkat reporter assay

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

NF-κB-GFP-Jurkat cells (500 000) were seeded
in 24-well plates in a total volume of 1 ml. The negative
control were the cells only and the positive control,
cells added TNFα (5 ng/ml) for 24 h. The NF-κB-GFPJurkat cells were treated with cytarabine (1 μM) and
daunorubicin (100 nM) separately and in combination
without and with the addition of TNFα (5 ng/ml) for
24 h. Cells were collected, centrifuged and washed with
PBS before 100 00 live cells were acquired per sample
and analyzed by Guava easyCyteTM (Merck Millipore)
flow cytometer using Guava Soft version 2.2.2 software.
Flow Cytometry results were analyzed using FlowJo 7.6
(Treestar). Results are representative of three independent
experiments.

OCI-AML3 cells (500 000) were seeded onto
L-lysine pre-coated coverslips followed by incubation at
37°C overnight before fixed (4% glutaraldehyde in 0.2
M Na-cacodylate in buffer diluted 1:1 with medium) for
2 h at RT. Cells were washed carefully three times for 15
min with 0.1 M Na-cacodylate buffer followed by a 60
min post-fixation with 1% osmiumtetraoxide in 0.1 M
Na-cacodylate buffer and washed twice for 10 min with
0.1 M Na-cacodylate buffer. Dehydration with ethanol
was performed with 30% for 15 min, 50% for 15 min,
70% for 20 min or overnight, 96% for 20 min and twice
with 100% for 20 min. The coverslips were obtained from
the wells and placed on SEM stubs before incubated in
a heat-incubator overnight. Critical point drying was
omitted in order to avoid breakage of TNTs. The SEM
stubs were coated with 5-10 nm gold/palladium before
SEM microscopy.

Daunorubicin in SAOS-2 cells
SAOS-2 cells were seeded on a fibronectin coated
8-well µ-slide (IBIDI) one day before incubating for 2 h
with 100 nM daunorubicin, followed by WGA-Alexa 488
staining and incubation in saline until analyzed by live cell
microscopy.

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting
according to standard protocol [61, 62]. Developed
immunoblots were detected, captured and quantified by
ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Quantification of immunoblot bands were performed
on 16-bit original files using 1D gel analysis option
in ImageQuant TL version 8.1 (GE Healthcare). Lane
creation was performed with the manual option and
background was subtracted using the manual baseline
option in this program. The final value after background
