Abstract

Author Manuscript

Zinc plays a crucial role in the biology of p53 in that p53 binds to DNA through a structurally
complex domain stabilized by zinc atom. The p53 negative regulator MDM2 protein also carries a
C-terminal RING domain that coordinates two zinc atoms which are responsible for p53 nuclear
export and proteasomal degradation. In this clinically translatable study, we explored the critical
role of zinc on p53 re-activation by MDM2-inhibitor MI-219 in colon and breast cancer cells.
ZnCl2 enhanced MI-219 activity (MTT, apoptosis and colony formation), and chelation of zinc not
only blocked the activity of MI-219, it also suppressed re-activation of the p53 and its downstream
effector molecules p21WAF1 and Bax. TPEN, a specific zinc chelator but not Bapta-AM, a calcium
chelator, blocked MI-219-induced apoptosis. Nuclear localization is a pre-requisite for proper
functioning of p53 and our results confirm that TPEN and not Bapta-AM could abrogate p53
nuclear localization and interfered with p53 transcriptional activation. Addition of zinc suppressed
the known p53 feedback MDM2 activation which could be restored by TPEN. Coimmunoprecipitation studies verified that MI-219-mediated MDM2-p53 disruption could be
suppressed by TPEN and restored by zinc. As such, single agent therapies that target MDM2
inhibition, without supplemental zinc, may not be optimal in certain patients due to the less
recognized mild zinc deficiency among the “at risk population” as in the elderly which are more
prone to cancers. Therefore, use of supplemental zinc with MI-219 will benefit the overall efficacy
of MDM2 inhibitors and this potent combination warrants further investigation.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The tumor-suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. However,
approximately 50% of all human tumors retain normal or wild type p53 (wt-p53) (Lane and
Fischer 2004). Direct activation of p53 in these tumors could in principle be used as a means
to eradicate tumor cells (Brown et al. 2009). p53 is activated in response to a variety of
stresses, such as DNA damage, nutrient deprivation or oncogenic activation, resulting in the
transcriptional activation of target genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis (Feng et al.
2008). To protect healthy cells from the deleterious effects of uncontrolled p53 activation,
p53 is subject to a negative feedback loop activated by the protein product of one of its
target genes, MDM2 (Marine and Lozano 2010). The protein MDM2 binds to p53, inhibits
its transcriptional activation, causes nuclear export and acts as an E3 ligase to target p53 for
proteasomal degradation (Kubbutat et al. 1997). Thus, there is a fine balance between
MDM2, p53 and the need for p53 activation to promote cell survival or apoptosis following
DNA damage or other cellular stresses. Unfortunately, in many cancers, the MDM2 protein
is over expressed and suppresses the activation of even the functional wt-p53, thereby
disrupting the finely-tuned balance of cell survival versus cell death. The end result is a loss
of control of the normal apoptotic processes and contributes to drug resistance. One
potential approach for re-activating p53 in tumor cells is to disrupt the interaction between
MDM2 and p53 with the MDM2-targeting small molecule MI-219 or related inhibitors
(Shangary and Wang 2009; Shangary et al. 2008; Verma et al. 2010; Vassilev 2007).
MI-219 binds to MDM2, thereby preventing the interaction with p53 and causing p53 to be
stabilized. We and others have shown that MI-219 can induce growth inhibition and
apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines and also induce growth arrest in corresponding tumor
xenografts (Yu et al. 2009; Canner et al. 2009; Mohammad et al. 2009; Shangary and Wang
2009; Shangary et al. 2008).

Wt-p53 is one of the best recognized “zinc-finger” transcription factors and binds DNA
through a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (p53DBD) extending from amino acid
residues 96–308 (Bargonetti et al. 1993). The p53DBD incurs an unusually high number of
mutations that consequently results in a failure to bind DNA and prevention of p53-induced
transcription (Levine et al. 1995; Levine 1997). This fact strongly suggests that sequencespecific DNA binding and transactivation are the key activities that control the biological
functions of p53 (Meek 1998). The crystal structure of p53DBD reveals that the p53 core
domain structure consists of a beta sandwich that serves as a scaffold for two large loops (L2
and L3) and a loop–sheet–helix motif (L1) (Pavletich et al. 1993). Zn2+ is coordinated to
C176 and H179 of the L2 loop and C238 and C242 of the L3 loop (Pavletich et al. 1993;
Cho et al. 1994). Zinc coordination has been demonstrated to be necessary for the proper
folding of the p53 core domain in vitro and disruption of this interaction greatly reduces or
abrogates p53 DNA binding and transactivation of target genes (Meplan et al. 2000). NMR
spectra reveal that the DNA-binding surface is altered by removing zinc ion and

fluorescence anisotropy studies show that zinc ion removal abolishes site-specific DNAbinding activity (Butler and Loh 2007; Butler and Loh 2003). Using a cell-permeable metal
chelator, previous investigators were able to show that depletion of intracellular zinc could
induce a change in p53 protein conformation, with loss of DNA-binding capacity, that was
reversible upon removal of the chelator from the culture medium or the addition of zinc to
the media (Verhaegh et al. 1998). The amount of supporting information certainly highlights
the crucial role of zinc in the biology of p53 protein and its importance for DNA binding as
well as stability of this important tumor suppressor.

Author Manuscript

The p53 negative regulator MDM2 protein contains a C-terminal RING domain (aa
430-480) which coordinates two molecules of Zinc (Wawrzynow et al. 2009a; Wallace et al.
2006). This unique RING finger is responsible for shuttling p53 out of the nucleus for
proteasomal degradation and is also responsible for MDM2 auto-ubiquitination (Itahana et
al. 2007; Lindstrom et al. 2007; Alshatwi et al. 2006). The intrinsic E3 activity of MDM2 is
dependent on its zinc-coordinated RING finger domain. The capacity to mediate MDM2's
own ubiquitination requires no eukaryotic protein other than E1 and E2. Therefore, Zinc acts
as a “double-edged sword” promoting p53 activity while simultaneously causing MDM2
auto-ubiquitination.

Author Manuscript

Mild zinc deficiency is a common occurrence in the elderly, a population that is well known
to be more prone to cancers (Prasad 2004; Prasad 2001; Prasad et al. 1993). The observed
deficiency of zinc in the elderly has been attributed to a combination of factors that includes
poor zinc absorption as well as consumption of low-zinc diets (Hambidge et al. 1998). Low
intracellular zinc has been found in different tumors and has been correlated to induction of
oxidative DNA damage, disruption of p53, AP1 DNA binding and affects DNA repair (Ho
and Ames 2002; Ho 2004; Ho and Song 2009). Therefore, therapies that are based on using
small molecule inhibitors to target MDM2 may not be fully successful in the clinical setting
or in patients due to unrecognized mild to moderate zinc deficiency. The studies presented in
this paper demonstrate that zinc is crucial for the activity of p53 re-activated by MI-219 and
provides evidence for using combination therapies with MI-219 that include supplemental
zinc for the treatment of wt-p53 tumors. Prior to MDM2 inhibitors making their way into the
clinic for patients, we believe that the results of our findings will have high impact towards
the design of novel treatment strategies (i.e combination with zinc) for achieving better
survival outcome.

Metal chelation in general and zinc-specific depletion suppresses MI-219-induced growth
inhibition and apoptosis
In order to verify the role of metal ions on the activity of MI-219 we performed growth
inhibition and apoptosis assays in media chelated to remove trace and non-trace metals
(chelexed media). Assessment of chelation using atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed
chelation of zinc (and minimal chelation of copper) (Supplementary Table 1). Our
laboratory has previously standardized the procedure of zinc chelation that minimally alters
the status of other trace metal ions such as iron, copper and magnesium (Bao et al. 2006;
Prasad et al. 2002; Prasad et al. 2001). HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells (wt-p53) were passaged

in chelexed media and then treated with MI-219 (0-10 μM for 72 hrs) followed by analysis
of growth inhibition by MTT assay. In normal media the IC50 of MI-219 in HCT-116 and
MCF-7 cells is 4μM and 3.5 μM respectively. However, in chelexed media depleted of trace
metals, the IC50 increased to >10 μM (Fig 1A). Similar to the results obtained from MI-219induced growth inhibition (0-10 μM for 72 hrs), MI-219 was also less effective in inducing
apoptosis in chelexed media (Fig 1B). We did not observe any appreciable toxicity
represented as change in growth patterns in cells grown in chelexed media vs those grown in
normal media (Fig 1C). Based on our preliminary studies to define the optimal conditions,
we found that specifically chelating Ca (using Bapta-AM) or copper (using Bath) had no
effect on the events studied here and these specific chelators were used as negative controls
in studies designed to determine the specific effect of zinc in MI-219-induced p53 reactivation. To delineate the crucial role of zinc on the efficacy of MI-219 we first evaluated
the effect of ZnCl2 (0-32 μM) on both HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells. As can be seen from
results of Fig 2A. ZnCl2 alone did not induce any appreciable growth inhibition in both cell
lines. We then performed dose kinetics experiment to verify the effect of ZnCl2 on MI-219
mediated cell growth inhibition. As can be seen from our novel results of Fig 2B ZnCl2 at
increasing doses progressively enhanced cell growth inhibition by MI-219. We also tested
the effect of this combination on colony formation capability in HCT-116 cells. Fig 2C
shows colony formation in control and zinc alone treated cells. MI-219 alone as expected
suppressed colony formation. However the most important and clinically relevant results are
observed in the combination treatment where no colonies were visible even after 4 weeks.
Taken together these results indicate that MI-219 requires trace metal ions specifically zinc
for its proper activity. Since Chelex is non specific metal chelator, in the next experiments
we used TPEN (a well recognized membrane permeable zinc-specific chelator) to verify the
exclusive role of zinc in mediating MI-219-induced apoptotic effects. Histone DNA ELISA
results shown in Fig 3A, confirm that addition of TPEN (1 μM) significantly blocks MI-219mediated apoptosis and this could be restored by the addition of 16 μM ZnCl2 to both
HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells. We also performed Annexin V FITC apoptosis analysis to
verify that MI-219 mediated apoptosis could only be blocked by TPEN and not other metal
chelators such as the calcium specific Bapta-AM or copper chelator bathocuproine (Fig 3B).
Taken together these results highlight a significant role of zinc in the activity of MI-219 on
wt-p53 cells. We then tested the role of zinc on the re-activation of p53 pathway in both
HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells.
Zinc depletion blocks MI-219 mediated p53 re-activation

Author Manuscript

It is well known that for its transcriptional activity, p53 requires a specific DNA binding
sequence that is coordinated by a complex helix domain motif stabilized by a zinc atom. It is
therefore expected, that by modifying zinc levels, one would affect the DNA binding
capacities of p53 which would result in altering the re-activation of p53 induced by MI-219.
We performed western blot analysis to determine the specific role of zinc on p53
reactivation. As can be seen from results of Fig 4A & B, in regular media MI-219 treatment
(0-10 μM for 24 hrs) in both HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells resulted in sequential up-regulation
of p53 along with downstream effecter molecules such as the cell cycle regulator p21 and
the pro-apoptotic Bax. However, using chelexed media, we found negligible to modest
expression of p53. Furthermore, the downstream effector's (p21 and Bax) were also not up-

regulated. We then used TPEN to evaluate the exclusive role of zinc on p53 re-activation on
cell growth in normal media. In line with our cell growth inhibition and apoptosis studies
using chelexed media, TPEN (1 μM) significantly blocked p53 pathway re-activation in both
HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells which could be partially restored by addition of 16 μM ZnCl2
(Fig 4C). These results confirm our hypothesis that zinc is required for the proper
reactivation of p53 by MI-219.
Zinc chelation blocks p53 nuclear localization

Author Manuscript

Nuclear localization of p53 is a necessary pre-requisite for its proper function (O'Brate and
Giannakakou 2003). Therefore, we tested whether zinc chelation could alter the nuclear
localization of p53. To achieve this, we used a fluorescent microscopy p53-Cell-Based
Activation/Translocation assay kit coupled with a highly specific p53 primary monoclonal
antibody and DyLight™ conjugated secondary antibody. As can be seen from results shown
in Fig 5A, in both HCT-116 (upper panel) and MCF-7 (lower panel) cells, MI-219 (5 μM)
could induce p53 nuclear localization in normal media but not in chelexed media. Chelation
of zinc with TPEN could suppress p53 localization that again, could be restored by addition
of ZnCl2 (16 μM). To further confirm that MI-219 activity is specifically directed towards
wt-p53, we used siRNA against p53 and as can be seen from results of Fig 5B, in both
HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells, p53 knockdown shows neither p53 activation nor translocation
induced by MI-219. To reaffirm siRNA silencing of p53, we also performed western blot
analysis to demonstrate negative expression of p53 in p53 siRNA treated and not control
siRNA treated cells (Fig 5C). These results for the first time, confirm that zinc is crucial for
the proper re-activation of p53 as well as its nuclear localization induced by the MDM2
inhibitor, MI-219.

Zinc augments p53 transcription in HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells

Author Manuscript

We tested the p53 transcription activity using a sensitive non-radioactive method for
detecting specific transcription factor DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts. In this assay,
a specific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequence containing the p53 response element is
immobilized onto the wells of a 96-well plate. p53 present in a nuclear extract, binds
specifically to the p53 response element and is detected by addition of a specific primary
antibody directed against p53. A secondary antibody conjugated to HRP is added to provide
a sensitive colorimetric readout at 450 nm. As can be seen from results of Fig 6A MI-219
(10 μM) induces p53 transcription that is significantly augmented by addition of ZnCl2
(16μM). In line with our growth inhibition, apoptosis, western blot and p53 nuclear
localization results, TPEN suppressed MI-219-mediated p53 transcription that could be
restored by addition of zinc. Furthermore, the MI-219 inactive analog, MI-10, did not induce
p53 transcriptional activity. These results are in further support of our hypothesis that zinc
plays an important role in the biology of p53 and its use in conjunction of such a targeted
therapy.
Zinc suppresses p53-MDM2 regulatory feedback mechanism
MDM2 contains an auto-regulatory RING finger domain that coordinates zinc atoms.
Therefore, we sought to assess the role of zinc addition and chelation on the activity of
MDM2. As can be seen from results shown in Fig 6B, MI-219 alone at 10 μM induces

MDM2 expression which was expected since activated p53 positively regulates MDM2
(Levine 1997). However, in the presence of zinc (ZnCl2 16 & 32 μM), the induction of
MDM2 was suppressed but could be restored by addition of TPEN. These results provide
evidence that zinc is required for proper positive regulation of MDM2 by p53. We further
performed Co-immunoprecipitation experiments to verify the affect of zinc chelation/
addition on disruption of MDM2-p53 complex. As can be seen from the results shown in Fig
6C, MI-219 disrupts the MDM2-p53 interaction (with less protein precipitated in the treated
samples) and this could be reversed by the addition of TPEN. The addition of supplemental
ZnCl2 (32 μM) could negate the effect of zinc chelator TPEN, thereby restoring the MI-219induced disassociation between MDM2 and p53.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

This clinically translatable study, for the first time, provides insight into the mechanisms by
which zinc affects the activity of the MDM2 inhibitor MI-219 in mediating proper
reactivation of p53 leading to apoptosis in wild type p53 cancer cells. MI-219 is entering
phase I clinical trials. Prior to MDM2 inhibitors making their way for treatment of cancer
patients, we believe that our findings will positively impact the design of MDM2 inhibitor
therapy.

According to the International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group (IZNCG) 20% of the
world's population lack sufficient zinc in their diet, while one-third live in countries
considered at high risk of zinc deficiency (Brown et al. 2004). Zinc is required by at least
200 different proteins and transcription factors (Christianson 1991). Zinc binding by p53
was confirmed when the partial crystal structure of the protein was published (Collins et al.
1997). The zinc atom has an essential structural role in stabilizing the architecture of the
DNA-binding domain of p53 and it has clearly been shown that zinc is an important cofactor for p53 DNA-binding activity in vitro. Most of this evidence relies on the fact that
metal chelators can remove zinc from p53, turning the protein to a ‘mutant-like’ form with
loss of such sequence-specific DNA-binding activity (Meplan et al. 1999). Likewise the p53
regulator MDM2 carries a RING domain that co-ordinates two zinc atoms (Wawrzynow et
al. 2009b). The major functions of this RING domain in to mediate nuclear export of p53 for
proteasomal degradation and also induce MDM2 auto-ubiquitination. Therefore, we believe
that zinc acts as a double edged sword on one hand promoting p53 re-activation and on the
other causing MDM2 degradation. Most of intracellular zinc is immobilized in proteins,
however, cells also contain a pool of labile zinc, which is in dynamic equilibrium with the
extracellular medium (Zalewski et al. 1993; Zalewski et al. 1994). This labile zinc can
undergo fluctuations (3-5 fold) depending on the availability of zinc. Such changes in zinc
levels (1-10 μM range) might have regulatory effects on specific, intracellular
metalloproteins including the all important p53.
Strategies that utilize MDM2 inhibition to re-activate p53 pathway may not be fully
successful in zinc deficient environments/patients. Based on this assumption, we
investigated in wt-p53 cancer cells (HCT-116 and MCF-7) and demonstrated that, zinc is
necessary to the activity of MDM2 inhibitor in mediating enhanced reactivation of p53
leading to apoptosis. Our findings confirmed that in the absence zinc, the efficacy of MI-219

is diminished. Following that, we verified the effect of zinc chelation on MI-219-induced
p53 re-activation. As expected, p53 pathway including downstream affector p21 and Bax,
re-activation was markedly suppressed by zinc chelation and most significantly, this activity
was restored by the addition of zinc. These results, provide irrevocable evidence for the
crucial requirement of zinc on the activity of MI-219 in restoring superior p53 functioning.

Cytoplasmic p53 is rapidly degraded by MDM2 mediated ubiquitination; a reason for
inhibiting MDM2 activity using MI-219. However, under stress, p53 shuttles to nucleus
where it trans-activates numerous genes regulating cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence
(Chen et al. 2006). It is logical to hypothesize that by blocking MDM2-p53 binding, p53
would be allowed to localize into the nucleus and initiate transcription of target genes. To
demonstrate that this is a zinc dependent phenomenon, we found that in the presence of zinc
chelator TPEN, p53 nuclear localization was significantly diminished and that the addition
of zinc could restore this function (Figure 5). Using siRNA against p53 to silence the p53
expression reaffirmed the nuclear localization data observed above which further re-instates
that zinc is a crucial component of the p53 localization signaling pathways. On a cautionary
note, we believe that it is too early to fully explain how zinc chelation blocks p53 nuclear
localization. One possibility is that zinc deficiency may induce p53 conformational change
that would hinder proper alignment of p53 to the nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS)
and thus block its nuclear translocation. Another explanation for the observed effects comes
from an earlier study done by Giannakakou and group, where it was shown that in low zinc
environment the microtubule assembly required to position p53 on NLS is disturbed and
results in reduced nuclear localization (Giannakakou et al. 2002). However, it is understood
that more work is needed in this direction before concluding to the exact mechanism behind
such reduced p53 nuclear localization. Pavletich et al., have reported that for proper
transcription, p53 requires specific DNA binding sequence that is regulated by zinc atoms
(Pavletich et al. 1993). In this study we also found that by lowering zinc levels p53
transcription activity was suppressed (Figure 6). Fortified with the above strong evidence,
we correctly hypothesized that zinc was required for the efficacy of MI-219 on the reactivation of p53.

Author Manuscript

It is well recognized that MDM2 expression is under a positive feedback loop of p53.
However, over-expression of MDM2 as may occur in cancer cells inhibits the p53 reactivation. This would make the cancerous/tumor cells to multiply continuously or become
resistant to chemotherapy. To this end we explored whether zinc could affect the MI-219induced inhibition of MDM2 and causes p53 release and thus, p53 re-activation. Our results
show that the addition of zinc can significantly enhance MI-219-induced suppression of
MDM2-p53 interaction. That this suppression could be reversed by a specific zinc chelator,
TPEN, provides clear proof for the role of zinc in this process. We believe that zinc
chelation may change the p53 binding pocket in MDM2, it is possible that zinc binding to
the sites on MDM2 may alter its conformation and thus its p53 binding affinity (summarized
in Figure 7). Such binding studies using x-ray crystallography are currently under study in
our laboratory. In conclusion therapies which use target p53 reactivation using MDM2
inhibitor approach may still not be fully successful in zinc deficient environment that is
commonly found in a sizable patient population (Prasad et al. 1993; Prasad 2001; Prasad

2004). Therefore, a logical step forward is to use supplemental zinc to enhance the efficacy
of MI-219 for treatment of cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, experimental reagents and chemicals

Author Manuscript

HCT-116 (wt-p53) was obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein's lab. MCF-7 wt-p53 breast
cancer cell line was purchased from ATCC. The cell lines have been tested and
authenticated in our core facility, Applied Genomics Technology Center at Wayne State
University, as late as March 13, 2009. The method used for testing was short tandem repeat
(STR) profiling using the PowerPlex® 16 System from Promega (Madison, WI). Primary
antibodies for p53, Bax, MDM2 and p21 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly
MA). All secondary antibodies were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). MI-219 was
synthesized by using our previously published methods (Ding et al. 2005; Ding et al. 2006).
Chelex 100 resin, the zinc chelator N,N,N′N′-tetrakis(-)[2-pyridylmethyl]-ethylenediamine
(TPEN), the calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(o-Aminophenoxy)- ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid
(BAPTA-AM), the copper chelator, bathocuprione disulfonate (Bath) and ZnCl2 were
purchased from Sigma.
Metal deficient media

Author Manuscript

Chelation of media and other solution with chelex 100 resin is a non-specific method of
removing unbound or excess trace and to some extent non-trace metals. The advantage of its
use is that the resin bound to the metals can be physically removed from the media. Metal
ions were removed from the culture media, DMEM or McCoy 5 A by incubating regular
media (DMEM supplemented with FBS penicillin and streptomycin and 10% glutamine or
McCoys 5A media supplemented with FBS penicillin and streptomycin, 10% glutamine and
10% HEPES) with chelex 100 resin (1 gram per 50 ml media) for 1 hr at 37°C. After
incubation, the media was vacuum filtered to remove the metal bound resin. The zinc and
copper content was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using our
previously established methods (Beck et al. 2004) and other electrolytes plus iron
determined by the clinical laboratories at the Detroit medical center. Chelation of particular
metal ions was accomplished by adding metal-specific chelators to normal media and
include TPEN for zinc, BAPTA-AM for Calcium, Bath for copper and desferroxamine for
Iron.

Figure 1. Chelation suppresses MI-219-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis

[A] Wt-p53 HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells were treated with MI-219 (0-10 μM for 72 hrs) in
either regular or chelexed media. Note: Growth inhibition (MTT assay) by MI-219 is
diminished in chelexed media. [B] Chelation reduced media zinc levels from 5 μM to 0.8
μM (AAS analysis Supplementary Table 1) and this was associated with reduced MI-219induced apoptosis (detected by Histone/DNA ELISA assay) in both cell lines (right and left
panels). [C] Microphotographs of HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells showing no apparent toxicity
reflected as changes in growth pattern of cells grown in either regular or chelexed media. All
experiments were performed in triplicates, data presented represents mean of three
independent experiments.

Figure 3. TPEN a zinc specific chelator blocks apoptosis by MI-219

[A] Cells were treated with MI-219 at indicated concentration for 72 hrs. TPEN blocked MI
219-induced apoptosis (Histone/DNA ELISA) which could be restored by addition of
physiological levels (16 μM) of ZnCl2. [B] Zinc augments MI-219-induced apoptosis
(Annexin V FITC assay) which can be abrogated by TPEN. Depletion of calcium using the
calcium specific chelator, Bapta-AM or copper, using a specific copper chelator,
bathocuproine, had no effect on MI-219-induced apoptosis in either cell line. All
experiments were performed in triplicate, data presented represents mean of three
independent experiments. * represents p<0.05 and ** p<0.01.

Figure 4. Zinc chelation blocks p53 re-activation by MI-219

Author Manuscript

HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells were grown in either regular or chelexed media and treated with
increasing doses of MI-219 (0-10 μM for 24 hrs). Protein lysates were analyzed using
western blot analysis for activation of the p53 pathway. [A & B] Cells grown in chelexed
media exhibited insignificant amounts of p53 or its downstream p21 and Bax compared to
cells grown in regular media. [C] MI-219 inhibition of MDM2 allowed for increased p53
and downstream Bax and p21 expression which could be abrogated by TPEN (a zinc
specific chelator) in normal (non-chelexed) media and then reversed by the addition of
physiological levels of ZnCl2. HCT-116 and MCF-7 cell were exposed to either DMSO;
MI-219 (10μM); MI-219 (10 μM) + TPEN (1μM) or MI-219 (10 μM) + TPEN (1μM) +
ZnCl2 (16 μM) (24 hrs) and western blot analysis was performed on lysates isolated from
treated cells. Blots are representative of three independent experiments. β-actin was used as
loading control.

Figure 5. TPEN suppresses p53 nuclear localization

Author Manuscript

[A] MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells (1000) were grown in triplicate in 96 well plates and treated
with either vehicle (DMSO); MI-219 (5 μM); MI-219 (5 μM) + TPEN (1 μM); MI-219 (5
μM) + TPEN (1 μM) + ZnCl2 (16 μM) or MI-219 (5 μM) + Bapta-AM (10 μM) for 4 hrs.
p53 activation/localization assay was performed using p53 localization kit according to
manufacturer's protocol (Cayman Chemicals Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Note: MI-219-induced
p53 localization in the nucleus is blocked by TPEN. Zinc treatment restores p53 in the
nucleus even in the presence of TPEN. Bapta-AM, a calcium chelator, had no effect on p53
nuclear localization. Cell grown in chelex media are also resistant to MI-219 mediated p53
nuclear localization. [B] p53 siRNA suppresses p53 nuclear localization/activation.
HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells were grown in 96 well plates and treated with either control
siRNA or p53 siRNA for 5 hrs in the absence or presence of MI-219 5 μM for 4 hrs and p53
localization was detected. siRNA treated MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells show reduced p53 in
the nucleus even in the presence of MI-219. [C] Western blot analysis showing siRNA
mediated suppression of p53 in both HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells.

Figure 6. Zinc enhances MI-219 mediated p53 transcription that is blocked by TPEN

Author Manuscript

[A & B] Semi-confluent HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells grown in triplicate were exposed to
either vehicle (DMSO); MI-219 (10 μM); MI-219 (10 μM) + ZnCl2 (16 μM); MI-219 (10
μM) + ZnCl2 (16 μM) + TPEN (1 μM); MI-219 (10 μM) + CaCl2 (15 μM) or MI-219 (10
μM) + CaCl2 (15 μM) + Bapta-AM (10 μM) for 24 hrs in 6 well plates. Nuclear lysates were
isolated and p53 transcription assay was performed in 96 well plates according to
manufacturer's protocol (Cayman Chemicals Ann Arbor, MI, USA). ZnCl2 (16 μM)
enhances MI-219 (10 μM) mediated p53 transcription that is blocked by TPEN. Calcium
does not induce p53 transcription and the calcium chelator, Bapta-AM has no affect. NiCl2
treated HELA cell lysates were used as positive control (provided in kit) while MI-10 the
inactive analogue of MI-219 was used as negative control. * represents p<0.05 and ** p<
0.01. [C] ZnCl2 suppresses MDM2 protein expression and enhances MI-219-induced
MDM2-p53 disruption. MCF-7 cells were exposed to either vehicle (DMSO); MI-219 (10
μM); MI-219 (10 μM) + ZnCl2 (16 μM); MI-219 (10 μM) + ZnCl2 (32 μM); MI-219 (10
μM) + ZnCl2 (16 and 32 μM) in the presence of TPEN (1 μM) for 24 hrs and protein lysates
were subjected to western blot analysis followed by probing with MDM2 antibody. ZnCl2
(16 and 32 μM) suppressed MDM2 expression [D] Co-immunoprecipitation studies of
MCF-7 cells demonstrate reduced disruption of MDM2-p53 interaction in the presence of
TPEN. Again ZnCl2 abrogates the effects of TPEN. Blots are representative of three
independent experiments.

Figure 7. Zinc plays a crucial role in the biology of p53 (a mechanistic summary)

Author Manuscript

[A]. MDM2 binds to p53 and targets p53 for nuclear export and proteasomal degradation.
[B] MI-219's ability to block this interaction is enhanced by the presence of zinc, releasing
p53 to bind to DNA. [C] p53 sequence specific DNA binding requires crucial zinc atoms. If
present, p53-initiated transcription blocks p53-MDM2 feedback loop and promotes MDM2
autoubiquitination. Chelation or TPEN, a membrane permeable metal chelator, abrogates
zinc mediated effects by removing zinc from p53 and causing a conformational change to
prevent DNA binding. Changes in binding affinity induced by zinc (or its removal) may also
apply to MI-219-MDM2 and MDM2-p53 interaction as well. [D]. TPEN also blocks zincmediated MDM2 auto-ubiquitination.
