Abstract:

Despite recent advances in the field, the treatment of patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) remains challenging and difficult. Although chemotherapeutic agents
induce remissions in a large number of patients, many of them eventually relapse and
die. A major goal for the development of new approaches for the treatment of AML
is to enhance the antileukemic effects of standard chemotherapeutics and to design
effective combinations targeting non-overlapping cellular pathways. The PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway plays a critical role in survival and growth of malignant
cells and its targeting has been the focus of extensive work and research efforts
over the last two decades. It now appears possible that a major limitation of the first
generation of mTOR inhibitors can be overcome by a new class of catalytic inhibitors
of mTOR. There is emerging evidence that such compounds target both TORC1 and
TORC2 and elicit much more potent responses against early leukemic precursors in
vitro. In addition, recent studies have shown that combinations of such agents with
cytarabine result in enhanced antileukemic responses in vitro, raising the prospect
and potential of use of these agents in combination regimens for the treatment of AML.

INTRODUCTION

is the inability to efficiently target and eliminate leukemia
initiating cells (LICs), which are the cells that initiate
and maintain the leukemic phenotype [10, 11]. The
majority of LICs are quiescent and therefore not sensitive
to various chemotherapeutic drugs that target and kill
rapidly dividing cells [12, 13]. This fact explains in part
the difficulty in eliminating leukemia with chemotherapy
and the relapses seen in the majority of patients, despite
initially achieving complete responses with classical
chemotherapy regimens. Aberrant activation of prosurvival signaling cascades in leukemia stem cells and
early committed leukemic precursors may also act
protectively and promote their survival, providing a
potential therapeutic outlet and elements that can be
targeted for the treatment of leukemias [12, 14].

Untreated, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a
fatal hematological malignancy. Although remissions
can be achieved with intensive chemotherapy, the disease
relapses in a large number of cases and progression and
death frequently occurs [1-5]. The current treatment
strategies, involving combinations of cytarabine with an
anthracycline, result in substantial toxicity and morbidity.
This is a particularly serious problem in the case of
older adults with the disease, who frequently have less
favorable outcomes than younger patients. Undoubtedly,
there is an urgent need for new treatments and therapeutic
approaches. AML appears to result from mutations
of key genes that ultimately lead to deregulation and
constitutive activation of cellular cascades that promote
cell growth and mediate anti-apoptotic and pro-survival
responses. Such changes result in deregulation of normal
hematopoiesis and promote malignant transformation
leukemogenesis [6-10].

important cellular activities and functions [15, 16].
Via controlling activation of the mTOR kinase and its
downstream effectors, this cellular network ultimately
regulates mRNA translation of genes that encode for
pro-oncogenic proteins and, thus, promote malignant cell
survival [15-18]. Interestingly, this network of signals
is also engaged and activated by growth suppressive
cytokines such as interferons (IFNs) [19-21], suggesting
a competition between factors that suppress growth
and mitogenic signals for the use and regulation of
this pathway. PI 3’ kinase (PI3’K) is a lipid kinase that
controls formation of distinct signaling complexes on
the membrane of cells [22]. Activation of PI3’K leads
to engagement of the kinase PDK1 which subsequently
phosphorylates AKT on threonine 308 (Thr 308),
ultimately leading to engagement and activation of AKT
[23], which in turn phosphorylates many and activates
multiple downstream substrates and effectors, leading
to the generation of signals that promote survival and
proliferation [24, 25].
As aberrant activation of the PI3’K/AKT/mTOR
pathway promotes malignant cell proliferation and
survival [15, 26, 27], several studies have sought to
examine the implications of constitutive activation of
this pathway in tumorigenesis. There is now extensive
evidence that deregulation of this pathway contributes to
the tumorigenic potential, a more aggressive phenotype
and poorer prognosis in several malignancies [28-30]. In
addition, activation of this pathway has been associated
with chemotherapy resistance [31, 32], underscoring the
importance of this signaling cascade as a therapeutic
target for the treatment of various tumors. For all these
reasons, there has been a major interest in the development
of pharmacologic inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway for various solid tumors and hematological
malignancies, which has further intensified after the
detailed mapping and characterization of the pathway the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

last several years.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
central element of the pathway and a key kinase activated
downstream of PI3K/AKT. This kinase was originally
identified in yeast [33], and subsequent work established
that it is conserved in eukaryotic organisms. mTOR is
present in two distinct and functionally diverse cellular
complexes: TORC1 and TORC2 (Fig. 1). Each of these
2 complexes have common and distinct subunits and
effectors and ultimately engage different downstream
elements and activate distinct effector pathways. As
shown in Fig. 1, the interaction of mTOR with Raptor
(regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) defines the
TORC1 complex [34-37]. TORC1 is generally perceived
as rapamycin-sensitive and beyond mTOR and Raptor, it
also contains mLST8 [35-37]. The two major substrates
for TORC1 are the S6 kinase (S6K) and the translational
repressor 4E-BP1, which binds to and negatively controls
the function of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)
[16, 19, 35-39]. After its phosphorylation/activation by
mTOR, S6K regulates downstream engagement of two
major substrates, the S6 ribosomal protein (rpS6) and the
eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) [16, 35-39] (Fig.2).
In addition, there is recent evidence that it phosphorylates
and negatively regulates the expression of PDCD4 (Fig.
2), a tumor suppressor protein with inhibitory activities
on cap-dependent translation via its ability to block the
function of the translation initiation factor eIF4A and the
integration of eIF4A into the eIF4F complex [40-44]. This
protein undergoes phosphorylation by S6K, followed
by degradation by the ubiquitin ligase βTRCP (45),
suggesting a mechanism by which the mTOR pathway
may be targeting and inhibiting tumor suppressor elements
with regulatory effects on mRNA translation. In addition,
to regulating activation of S6K, the mTORC1 complex is
responsible for phosphorylation of the (eIF4E)–binding
proteins (4E-BP) 1 and 2 on several sites, leading to
511

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 510 - 517

their de-activation and detachment from eIF4E [19, 3539]. Such dissociation allows eIF4E activation, which is
a critical event for the initiation of mRNA translation by
oncogenic proteins in eukaryotes.
In contrast to TORC1, whose major function is
control of signals for the initiation of mRNA translation,
the TORC2 complex plays a different role in normal and
malignant cells. The TORC2 complex includes mTOR,
Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR),
SIN1, and mLST8 [35-37, 46-48]. The primary function
of TORC2 is the control of phosphorylation of AKT on
Ser 473 [35-37], a site whose phosphorylation is essential
for activation of AKT resulting in induction of its kinase
domain. Beyond AKT, additional substrates for TORC2
activity have been identified, including PKCα, [49-51]
and SGK1 [52, 53]. Notably it was recently shown that
PKCα gene expression is inducible in AML cells resistant
to chemotherapy [54].
Because of the high relevance of the mTOR pathway
in malignancies, first generation mTOR inhibitors,
including rapamycin and related drugs (rapalogs) have
been tried extensively in various clinical contexts for the
treatment of tumors of diverse cellular origin. Two rapalogs,
temsirolimus (CCI-779) and everolimus (RAD001) have
shown major activity and have been approved by the
FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma [55, 56].
Since then extensive clinical efforts have been ongoing in
attempts to evaluate the clinical activity of the three major
rapalogs (everolimus, temsirolimus and ridaforolimus) in
the treatment of various solid tumors and hematological
malignancies [57-60].

has been extensive evidence that the PI3’K/AKT/mTOR
pathway is aberrantly activated and deregulated in AML
[61]. There is also some evidence that constitutive PI
3’K activation in AML is mainly due to the activity of
the PI3K p110δ isoform [62, 63]. In one study, a large
percentage of samples from patients with AML were found
to have constitutive AKT activation [64]. In addition, the
AKT pathway was among the signaling cascades whose
simultaneous activation with other pathways, such as
PKCα and ERK, was found to confer a poor prognosis
in AML [65]. Other recent studies used proteomic
analysis or single-cell network profiling (SCNP) with
flow cytometry, to predict the likelihood of response to
induction chemotherapy for patients with AML [66, 67].
Remarkably, lack of response to induction chemotherapy
in patients older than 60 years or patients with secondary
AML was associated with increased phosphorylation of
AKT induced by FLT-3 ligand [67].
Recognition of aberrations in the AKT/mTOR
pathway has led to clinical trials with rapalogs in AML.
Recher et al showed that rapamycin resulted in blast
clearance in some patients with AML. However, the length
of response was limited and not all patients responded
[68]. There has been also some evidence that rapamycin
and etoposide exhibit synergistic/enhancing effects on
AML cells in vitro and in AML mouse models in vivo
[69]. However, when a clinical trial involving the addition
rapamycin to salvage chemotherapy (mitoxantrone,
etoposide, and cytarabine) for the treatment of relapsed
and refractory AML was performed, the authors failed to
observe synergistic activity by the combination [70].

several limitations as discussed above. To overcome the
limitations of the rapalogs, extensive efforts over recent
years have been focused on the design and clinical
development of agents that are catalytic inhibitors of
mTOR and in addition to TORC1 suppress TORC2, or
other agents that simultaneously target the PI3’K/AKT
pathway. Several pan PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and
dual TORC inhibitors have been developed and are being
exploited [72-79]. Such efforts have also been extended
to determine the effects of such compounds on leukemias.
Recent studies demonstrated that the dual TORC1/
TORC2 inhibitors PP242 [80] or OSI-027 [81] are potent
suppressors of both TORC1 and TORC2 activities in BCRABL transformed cells. These catalytic inhibitors were
shown to elicit potent antileukemic effects in vitro [80,
81] and in vivo [81] on CML or Ph+ ALL cells, including
cells expressing the T315I BCR-ABL mutation, which
is resistant to the kinase inhibitors currently approved
for use in the treatment of CML and Ph+ ALL (imatinib
mesylate, nilotinib, dasatinib).
The potent suppressive effects of dual TORC1/
TORC2 inhibitors on BCR-ABL-transformed cells, have
raised the possibility that such agents may have activity
in other leukemias and prompted us to perform additional
studies to examine the spectrum of the antileukemic
properties of OSI-027 in AML. In recently published
work [82], we examined the effects of dual TORC1/2
inhibition on various elements of the mTOR pathway
in different AML cell lines and primary leukemia blasts
from AML patients and compared them to the effects of
the classic mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. As expected, only
OSI-027 blocked TORC2-specific cellular events in AML
cells, such as phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473 [82]. On
the other hand, both OSI-027 and rapamycin were potent
suppressors of the activation of the S6 kinase and the
downstream phosphorylation of its target, S6 ribosomal
protein [82] Importantly, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on
Thr 37/46 was blocked by OSI-027, but not rapamycin,
indicating that such phosphorylation is a rapamycininsensitive cellular event in AML cells (79). This is
consistent with the emerging evidence in other systems
for rapamycin-insensitive TORC1-mediated signals [83,
84]. Our studies also established that OSI-027 is a potent
suppressor of primitive leukemic precursors (CFU-L)
from AML patients. Such effects were much more potent
than the effects of rapamycin analyzed in parallel [82]. In
addition, OSI-027 enhanced the inhibitory effects of lowdose cytarabine (Ara-C), suggesting that combinations
of dual TORC1/2 inhibitors with chemotherapy may
provide an approach to enhance antileukemic responses
of chemotherapy [82].
Altogether, the results of such work raise the
prospect of future clinical trials using dual TORC1/
TORC2 inhibitors for the treatment of AML. Beyond OSI027 there are additional TORC1/2 inhibitors in clinical or
pre-clinical development [73-77, 85] that may be good
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

candidates for such studies. Another potential approach to
generate antileukemic responses by complete inhibition of
the mTOR pathway would be to block the PI3’K/AKT axis
[86]. In fact, approaches to simultaneously block PI3’K
and mTOR have been developed [87]. NVPBEZ235 is
a molecule that inhibits the PI3’K and also both TORC1
and TORC2 complexes [88]. Recent studies using this
agent in AML have demonstrated potent inhibitory effects
on PI3’K and TORC1/TORC2 complexes, including
rapamycin-insensitive TORC1. It was also found to
inhibit rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation sites in
4E-BP1 [89]. Such potent effects were associated with
decreased cell proliferation and survival of leukemia cells
and suppressed leukemic progenitor clonogenicity [89],
raising the prospect of using such pan P13’K/AKT/mTOR
inhibitors as a potential future approach for the treatment
of AML.

SUMMARY
While inhibiting mTOR is a promising strategy for
the treatment of malignancies, agents that selectively
target TORC1 (rapalogs) have limited clinical activity and
are unlikely to have major impact in the treatment of AML.
The development of selective ATP-catalytic inhibitors,
which have the capacity to block the functions of both
TORC1 and TORC2 has resulted in new momentum in the
research field of mTOR targeting in AML and is igniting
important work with major therapeutic implications.
Approaches to overcome the limitations of rapalogs for the
treatment of leukemias are now possible, using either dual
TORC1/2 inhibitors or pan–PI3K-TORC1/2 inhibitors.
Our recent studies have established that beyond exhibiting
potent antileukemic effects, dual TORC1/2 catalytic
inhibition enhances the effects of cytarabine on primitive
leukemic precursors from AML patients. These studies
are very encouraging and suggest a potential role for
these agents in the treatment of AML patients. They also
raise the possibility that combinations of dual TORC1/2
inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents may provide a
novel approach to target leukemic initiating stem cells and
increase the probability of cure for AML patients.
