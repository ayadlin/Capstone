Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for
approximately 10% of all paediatric oncology deaths1,2. To identify genetic risk factors for
neuroblastoma, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,251 patients and
6,097 control subjects of European ancestry from four case series. Here we report a significant
association within LIM domain only 1 (LMO1) at 11p15.4 (rs110419, combined P = 5.2 × 10−16,
odds ratio of risk allele = 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.25–1.44)). The signal was enriched in
the subset of patients with the most aggressive form of the disease. LMO1 encodes a cysteine-rich
transcriptional regulator, and its paralogues (LMO2, LMO3 and LMO4) have each been previously
implicated in cancer. In parallel, we analysed genome-wide DNA copy number alterations in 701
primary tumours. We found that the LMO1 locus was aberrant in 12.4% through a duplication
event, and that this event was associated with more advanced disease (P < 0.0001) and survival (P
= 0.041). The germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles and somatic copy
number gains were associated with increased LMO1 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and
primary tumours, consistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Short hairpin RNA
(shRNA)-mediated depletion of LMO1 inhibited growth of neuroblastoma cells with high LMO1
expression, whereas forced expression of LMO1 in neuroblastoma cells with low LMO1
expression enhanced proliferation. These data show that common polymorphisms at the LMO1
locus are strongly associated with susceptibility to developing neuroblastoma, but also may
influence the likelihood of further somatic alterations at this locus, leading to malignant
progression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Multiple somatically acquired chromosomal rearrangements, such as focal amplification of
the MYCN oncogene or deletions at chromosome arms 1p or 11q, are each associated with
an aggressive neuroblastoma phenotype2. Although these somatically acquired genomic
alterations are of clinical use as prognostic biomarkers, until recently little was known about
the constitutional genetic events that initiate tumorigenesis. Highly penetrant gain-offunction mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase domain were
recently identified as the major cause of familial neuroblastoma, and somatic mutations in
this gene implicate it as a target for therapeutic intervention3–6. In addition, a neuroblastoma
GWAS identified common SNPs at 6p22 as being associated with susceptibility to
aggressive neuroblastoma in sporadic cases7; follow-up association analysis on the clinically
relevant group of patients with an aggressive tumour phenotype indicated that common
SNPs within BARD1 also function as susceptibility variants8. Finally, our GWAS has also
identified a common copy number variation at 1q21.1 being highly associated with
neuroblastoma and probably playing a role in early tumorigenesis through disruption of a
novel neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene (NBPF23)9. Taken together, it has become
clear that the embryonal cancer neuroblastoma is genetically heterogeneous, and initiation of
sporadically occurring disease requires multiple interacting genetic factors, including both
sequence and copy number variants.
To identify additional genetic risk factors, we expanded our previous GWAS and analysed
1,627 neuroblastoma patients accrued through the North American-based Children’s
Oncology Group with 3,254 genetically matched control subjects of European ancestry (see
Supplementary Methods). All subjects were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550

BeadChip with over 550,000 SNP markers; the genomic control inflation factor was 1.08
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Clusters of SNPs from three genomic loci reached genome-wide
significance (P < 5 × 10−8; Fig. 1a), including two SNPs within FLJ22536/FLJ44180 at the
6p22 locus (P values range from 2.46 × 10−14 to 3.25 × 10−13; Supplementary Table 1),
nine SNPs within or nearby BARD1 at the 2q35 locus (P values range from 3.05 × 10−13 to
9.69 × 10−9; Supplementary Table 2), each previously reported, and two SNPs within LMO1
(LIM domain only 1), a newly identified neuroblastoma susceptibility locus at 11p15.4 (P
values range from 5.12 × 10−10 to 2.83 × 10−8; Table 1 and Fig. 1b). Closer examination of
the LMO1 locus identified a total of four SNPs that show strong association signals (P < 1 ×
10−4) with neuroblastoma (Table 1), which are in a moderate degree of linkage
disequilibrium (Supplementary Fig. 2). We then examined each of the most significant SNPs
from the 2q35, 6p22, 11p15.4 susceptibility loci and the 1q21.1 copy number variation.
However, we did not find evidence for epistasis (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), indicating
that these susceptibility loci increase disease risk independently.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To replicate our findings, we examined the association results from an independent case
series of 190 patients from the Children’s Oncology Group and 1,507 control subjects, all of
whom were genotyped on the Human610-Quad arrays. All four LMO1 SNPs identified in
the discovery effort showed the same direction of association in this replication cohort, with
P values ranging from 1.01 × 10−5 to 0.058. To seek additional evidence of replication, we
performed quantitative PCR-based genotyping of these four SNPs in a third independent
case series from UK, as well as the two most significant SNPs in a fourth independent case
series from Italy. Combined analysis by the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel method
demonstrated that two of the four SNPs had P values that extend well beyond the genomewide significance threshold (Table 1). Additionally, using the two cohorts with wholegenome genotype data (discovery cohort and US replication cohort), we performed genotype
imputation at 11p15.4 and identified six additional genome-wide significant markers, the
most significant being rs110420 (P = 1.17 × 10−13), which is in complete linkage
disequilibrium (r2 = 1 in HapMap CEU subjects (Utah residents with ancestry from northern
and western Europe) with the genotyped marker rs110419 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table
5).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next determined if the LMO1 genotypes were associated with a particular clinical
phenotype and/or patient survival. Similar to the association pattern observed for the 6p22
and 2q35 (BARD1) loci7,8, the risk alleles of LMO1 were significantly associated with
metastatic disease (P = 0.0040), advanced age (greater than 1 year, P < 0.0001) and a highrisk status by Children’s Oncology Group criteria for treatment stratification2 (P = 0.0010;
Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Consistent with this observation, the rs110419 risk allele
was associated with decreased event-free survival (P = 0.0085; Supplementary Table 8 and
Supplementary Fig. 3) and overall survival (P = 0.0217; Supplementary Fig. 4). Taken
together, these data suggest that common germline variants at LMO1 are associated not only
with predisposition to develop neuroblastoma, but also with a predilection to develop the
more aggressive form of the disease. They emphasize that LMO1 genetic variations are
associated with a particular neuroblastoma phenotype; however, this does not indicate that
these variants have prognostic significance for an individual with neuroblastoma.
The LMO1 gene encodes a cysteine-rich transcriptional regulator with two LIM zinc-binding
domains that is mainly expressed in the nervous system10. LMO1 belongs to a protein
superfamily encoded by four genes, including LMO1, LMO2, LMO3 and LMO4. Multiple
lines of evidence, including chromosomal translocation events and mouse models, strongly
implicate this gene family in the aetiology of human cancer11–14. Most provocatively,
retroviral insertion of the corrective gene for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency
into the LMO2 locus resulted in T-cell leukaemias in several participants in gene therapy

trials15. LMO4 represses the transcription of BRCA1, and dys-regulation of LMO4
expression has been implicated in the breast car-cinogenesis16,17. Finally, LMO3 has been
shown to act as an oncogene in neuroblastoma through the neuronal transcription factor
HEN218. We therefore postulated that the common variants at the 11p15.4 locus discovered
here may increase disease risk through a cis-acting effect on the regulation of expression or
function of LMO1, but we cannot exclude the potential for trans-acting influences on loci
distant from the discovered common variants.
We next examined tumour DNA genotyped on the Illumina SNP arrays for 701
neuroblastomas using a detection algorithm for copy number designed for tumour
samples19. We detected relative segmental gain (copy number changes at a given locus
relative to whole-genome copy number changes) at LMO1 in 87 out of 701 tumours
(12.4%); this was particularly enriched in the high-risk group where the GWAS signal was
most robust (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Most tumours with 11p gain showed a duplication of
the entire chromosome p arm, but four tumours (approximately 5%) showed focal gain
restricted to 11p15 including the LMO1 locus (Supplementary Fig 5b). These data
demonstrate that LMO1 is one of many genes showing somatic copy number gain on 11p,
and here we used the GWAS data to prioritize it as a potential target of this somatically
acquired chromosomal rearrangement.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next examined whether somatic LMO1 alterations were associated with neuroblastoma
clinical phenotype and survival of patients (Supplementary Table 9). Gain of LMO1 was
significantly more common in tumours from patients with metastatic disease (P < 0.0001),
advanced age (greater than 1 year, P < 0.0001), unfavourable pathological grade (P =
0.0013) and Children’s Oncology Group high-risk classification (P < 0.0001). Gain of 11p
was rarely observed in the MYCN amplified cases (Supplementary Table 9). Despite the
strong association of 11p gain in cases without MYCN amplification, a known powerful
adverse prognostic factor1, LMO1 gain was associated with decreased overall survival of
patients (P = 0.041) (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate how the neuroblastoma-associated LMO1 alleles may contribute to tumour
initiation and/or clinical phenotype, we next genotyped a set of human neuroblastomaderived cell lines with Illumina SNP arrays, and measured messenger RNA (mRNA) and
protein expression levels on the subset of lines without copy number changes at 11p to avoid
the influence of somatic DNA alterations on gene expression. Cell lines with diploid 11p
status and harbouring homozygous risk alleles showed significantly higher LMO1 mRNA
and protein expression than those with homozygous non-risk alleles (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Table 11). This trend held in an expanded set of 25 neuroblastoma cell lines
with variable 11p status (Supplementary Fig. 8). To determine if this correlation existed in
diagnostic tumour tissues, we next examined mRNA expression levels on a whole-genome
Affymetrix expression microarray20 in a subset of 61 neuroblastoma primary tumours from
patients whose blood samples and primary tumours had both been genotyped on the Illumina
SNP arrays. Among these 61 tumours, 13 harboured somatic gain of 11p. Considering both
somatic and germline genotypes in the same linear regression model, we detected an
association between LMO1 copy number gains and increased LMO1 expression (P = 0.02;
Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 12), as well as an association between rs110419 risk
alleles and increased LMO1 expression (P = 0.022; Fig. 2b). To refine the genotypeexpression relationships further, we subsequently used quantitative PCR to measure LMO1
expression in an additional set of 23 tumours without LMO1 gain. We confirmed that the
rs110419 risk allele is associated with LMO1 expression (P = 0.01), independent of copy
number changes (Fig. 2c). To determine whether a regulatory variant exists at a narrow
promoter region of LMO1, we performed Sanger sequencing in 20 neuroblastoma cell lines
but did not detect any potential causal variant (Supplementary Table 13). Examination of the

1000 Genomes Project data identified over 300 SNPs within or surrounding LMO1 that are
in moderate to strong linkage disequilibrium (D′ > 0.5) with rs110419 (Supplementary Table
14); however, fine mapping of this region through resequencing will be required to identify
whether any are causal cis-regulatory variants. Subsequent experimentation will be required
to determine if causal DNA variations directly impact LMO1 expression, and if somatic
copy-number gain indeed is targeting LMO1 for further increased expression in tumour
cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As our germline and somatic genomic analyses implicated LMO1 as a neuroblastoma
oncogene, we next sought to determine the functional consequences of LMO1 depletion or
overexpression in a genotype- and expression-specific manner. First, after lentiviral-based
shRNA infection of neuroblastoma cell lines, we were able to recover stable clones with 45–
63% depletion of LMO1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 3e). Cells with the homozygous
neuroblastoma-associated genotype and high LMO1 expression showed significantly
decreased proliferation compared with mock-infected controls (Fig. 3a, b), whereas cells
with homozygous non-risk alleles showed little phenotypic effect (Fig. 3c, d). Finally, to
determine the cellular phenotypes of forced overexpression of LMO1, we stably
overexpressed LMO1 with approximately fourfold higher levels in the SK-N-BE2C cell line
with low de novo LMO1 expression, and detected significantly enhanced proliferation (Fig.
3f). Therefore it appears that inhibition of LMO1 in cells expressing high levels of LMO1 or
activation of LMO1 in cells with low levels of LMO1 leads to pronounced phenotypes.
Taken together, these data suggest that LMO1 may function as an oncogene in a subset of
human neuroblastomas.
In conclusion, here we have identified germline sequence variants at the LMO1 locus that
are robustly associated with neuroblastoma. We have applied an integrative genomics
approach to demonstrate that common genetic polymorphisms associated with cancer
predisposition may also mark regions of the genome prone to somatic alterations influencing
tumour progression. Our data suggest that GWAS studies can identify previously
undiscovered oncogenic drivers of a malignant phenotype, especially when they occur in a
region of the genome involved in large segmental rearrangements impacting hundreds of
genes. In paediatric cancers such as neuroblastoma, the real translational potential of GWAS
efforts may be in discovering therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers of tumour
aggressiveness.

METHODS SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All genome-wide SNP genotyping for the discovery cohorts was performed using the
Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip at the Center for Applied Genomics at the Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia. Multi-dimensional scaling was performed using PLINK version
1.06 on a subset of SNPs not in linkage disequilibrium to identify subjects of European
ancestry, and all control subjects were genetically matched to patients. The first replication
case series was genotyped by Illumina Human610 BeadChip, yet two additional replication
case series were genotyped by TaqMan. Genotype imputation was performed by MACH
(http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/) on discovery and replication case series
with whole-genome genotypes. Alteration calls in tumour copy number were generated from
data of SNP signal intensity by the OverUnder19. Survival analyses used the methods of
Kaplan and Meier, with standard errors following the methods of Peto et al.21. For gene
expression profiling by Affymetrix U95Av2 microarrays, the expression measures for each
probe set was extracted and normalized using robust multi-array average protocols from raw
CEL files. Association tests on genotype and expression were performed on log-transformed
expression values by linear regression or t-test. For quantitative PCR on LMO1, TaqMan
probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems with assay identity Hs00231133_m1.

Relative expression of the target gene was determined by normalization to HPRT1 using a
standard curve method with ten serial dilutions according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
All quantitative PCR reactions were performed in triplicate with an ABI PrismTM 7900HT
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). For the LMO1 knockdown experiments,
the lentiviral particles for shRNA knockdown were purchased from Santa Cruz, including
copGFP Control Lentiviral Particles (catalogue number sc-108084) and LMO1 shRNA(h)
Lentiviral Particles (catalogue number sc-38025-v). Pooled clones of SK-N-BE2C cells with
LMO1 overexpression were created through stable transfection of full-length LMO1
complementary DNA in pCDNA3.1 as previously described22.

Figure 3. Genetic manipulation of LMO1 expression in neuroblastoma cell line models influences
proliferative phenotype in an expression-specific manner

a–d, In cells with neuroblastoma risk alleles and higher LMO1 expression levels, LMO1
knockdown leads to inhibition of cellular proliferation. e, LMO1 knockdown as measured by
quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and western blot for experiments a–d. f, In SK-NBE2C cells with non-risk alleles and low LMO1 expression levels, forced overexpression of
LMO1 leads to enhanced cellular proliferation. Approximate fourfold overexpression of
LMO1 RNA and protein are shown. Error bars, s.e.m.
