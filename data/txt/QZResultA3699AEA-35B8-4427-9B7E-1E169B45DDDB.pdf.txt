ABSTRACT
Aromatase is a critical enzyme in the irreversible conversion of androgens
to oestrogens, with inhibition used clinically in hormone-dependent malignancies.
We tested the hypothesis that targeted aromatase inhibition in an aggressive
brain cancer called glioblastoma (GBM) may represent a new treatment strategy.
In this study, aromatase inhibition was achieved using third generation inhibitor,
Letrozole, encapsulated within the core of biodegradable poly lactic-co-glycolic acid
(PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs). PLGA-NPs were conjugated to human/mouse chimeric
anti-GD2 antibody ch14.18/CHO, enabling specific targeting of GD2-positive GBM
cells. Treatment of primary and recurrent patient-derived GBM cells with freeLetrozole (0.1 µM) led to significant decrease in cell proliferation and migration;
in addition to reduced spheroid formation. Anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO-NPs displayed
specific targeting of GBM cells in colorectal-glioblastoma co-culture, with subsequent
reduction in GBM cell numbers when treated with anti-GD2-ch14.18-PLGA-Let-NPs in
combination with temozolomide. As miR-191 is an estrogen responsive microRNA,
its expression, fluctuation and role in Letrozole treated GBM cells was evaluated,
where treatment with premiR-191 was capable of rescuing the reduced proliferative
phenotype induced by aromatase inhibitor. The repurposing and targeted delivery
of Letrozole for the treatment of GBM, with the potential role of miR-191 identified,
provides novel avenues for target assessment in this aggressive brain cancer.

a poor prognosis and treatment limitations, but also direct
repercussions on quality of life and cognitive functions of
the patient. With 3.19 in 100,000 people newly diagnosed
each year GBM has the highest number of cases of all
malignant brain tumors [1]. Until recently, the World

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain
tumor and the most prevalent malignant primary brain
tumor in adults. This highly aggressive tumor has not only

Health Organization (WHO) classified gliomas into grades
I to IV defined by increasing degrees of undifferentiated
phenotype, grade of malignancy, proliferative index,
response to treatment and survival time. While Grade I
and II described benign and relatively non-malignant
tumors, Grade III were tumors of low-grade malignancy,
and Grade IV astrocytoma were designated the term
glioblastoma (GBM) [2]. In 2016, CNS tumors were
redefined by the WHO to incorporate both histological and
molecular features including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
(IDH)-wildtype, IDH-mutant, giant cell glioblastoma,
gliosarcoma, epithelioid GBM and diffuse midline glioma,
H3 K27 mutant [3]. Unfortunately however the median
survival rate for GBM remains at 14.6 months [4], with a
five year survival rate of only 4–5%. This dismal outcome
motivates a search for novel and effective therapies to treat
this incurable disease.
A combination of resection, radiotherapy (RT) and
chemotherapy is the current standard of care for treating
GBM. The degree of resection is of greatest importance
as it can prolong survival significantly [5–7]; however, it
is difficult to achieve complete resection without causing
neurological deficits due to the highly invasive capacity
of GBM cells in infiltrating adjacent brain tissue [8].
Ionizing radiation therapy remains the most clinically
effective treatment strategy for most CNS tumors. Firstline chemotherapy for GBM is the DNA alkylating
agent temozolomide (TMZ). Despite the fact that several
chemotherapies are available, patients treated with TMZ
have the highest median survival rate compared to other
chemotherapeutic agents [4, 9]. TMZ has much less
toxicity than other chemotherapeutics and is administered
orally.
Although the number of studies of GBM has grown
and current therapy regimes have improved, only little
improvement has been achieved in the last decade, with
patients still waiting for a breakthrough which extends
life beyond the median 14 months of survival post initial
diagnosis. Unfortunately the majority of preclinical
therapies which were shown to be effective have
subsequently failed in the clinic. A promising approach,
which holds real translation potential for the treatment of
GBM, is drug repurposing [10–12].
Aromatase, or estrogen synthase, is a critical
enzyme in the irreversible conversion of androgens to
estrogen [13]. The aromatase enzyme is comprised of
a microsomal cytochrome P450 complex which is a
product of the CYP19A1 gene. Innate aromatase activity
is found to be present in gonadal tissues, uterus, breast,
prostate, epididymis, placenta, adrenal glands, liver,
skin, muscle, vascular endothelium, bone and brain [14].
Moreover estrogen is associated with several cancers and
protects against adverse symptoms during the peri- and
postmenopausal intervals, stimulating cellular proliferation,
migration and growth of reproductive tissues [15]. The
inhibition of aromatase enzyme is currently used in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer, alterations
of ovarian and endometrial function and treatment of
benign disorders like gynecomastia as uncontrolled
proliferation is targeted. In the present study, we therefore
investigated the effects of aromatase inhibition on GBM
cells proliferation, migration and, ultimately when used as
an adjunct therapy, chemoresistance.
Specifically targeting drugs to disease sites within
targeted polymeric carriers offers great potential to
eliminate adverse side effects. Poly lactic-co-glycolic
acid (PLGA) is a well-established polymeric excipient
(FDA approved) consisting of poly lactic acid (PLA)
and poly glycolic acid (PGA). Disialogangliosidase2
(GD2) is a highly glycosylated sphingolipid which has
been shown to be highly expressed in high-grade gliomas
[16] in addition to several other cancer types [17]. It
was also reported as a target for glioblastoma [18] but,
to date, there has been no clinical development related
to GBM. Clinical experience with anti-GD2 antibodies
was generated in neuroblastoma, a paediatric malignancy
characterized by high GD2 expression. Several antiGD2 antibodies are under clinical development
and dinutuximab (ch14.18 produced in SP2/0 cells)
was approved for the treatment of neuroblastoma in
combination with IL2 and GM-CSF [19]. In Europe,
ch14.18 was remanufactured in CHO cells (anti-GD2ch14.18/CHO) [20, 21], which is currently used in
clinical trials [22, 23]. Based on these considerations, we
investigated whether ch14.18/CHO may provide a novel
approach to target nanoparticles to glioblastoma and
thereby minimise off-target effects.
In this study, biodegradable PLGA nanoparticles
containing the aromatase inhibitor, Letrozole, were
synthesized and capable of selective target recognition in
co-culture experiments. Furthermore it was determined
that aromatase inhibition lead to improved drug response
to clinically relevant chemotherapeutic treatment.

RESULTS
Assessment of aromatase expression
To evaluate the expression of aromatase as a target
in patient-derived glioblastoma cells we investigated the
protein levels of P450 (aromatase) in a panel of both
patient-derived cell lines and xenograft tumor lysates.
Glioblastoma cell lines derived from primary tumors, MZ327 and RN1 and recurrent derived GBM tumors, MZ256 and MZ-304, in addition to several patient derived
xenograft tumour lysates provided by the Mayo Clinic
Brain Tumor SPORE (G46, G59, G64, G75, G76, G79,
G80, G84, G85 and G91, Supplementary Table 1) [24–27]
were assessed by Western blot (Figure 1). Notably, all
GBM samples assessed express P450 at the molecular
weight of 50–55 kDa, corresponding to the apparent
molecular weight of aromatase.

cell line U251 expressed β4GANT1, it was of interest to
the authors to assess patient-derived lines in this study.
Expression of GD2 synthase patient-derived lines MZ256, MZ-304 and RN1-spheroid was further confirmed by
flow cytometry analysis (Figure 3B). Based on their high
GD2 synthase expression levels these lines were chosen
for further investigations.

To address the role of aromatase in GBM cells,
the effects of P450-specific inhibitor, Letrozole, was
further assessed. Primary (RN1) and recurrent (MZ256 and MZ-304) GBM cell lines were incubated with
Letrozole (0.1 µM) for 24–72 hours, to determine if the
Letrozole has an impact on biological characteristics of
GBM cell lines such as motility, proliferation and sphereforming potential. Notably all cells treated with Letrozole
showed a significant decrease in cell motility compared
to vehicle-treated (DMSO) controls (Figure 2A and 2B).
As shown in Figure 2C, cell number was significantly
reduced in all three cell lines when treated with Letrozole
(0.1 µM) for 72 hours and RN1 cells displayed reduced
spheroid formation capabilities when exposed to Letrozole
(0.1 µM) over a 72 hour period (Figure 2D and 2E
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

Characterisation of PLGA-Let-NPs and
visualisation of anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO-PLGAAlexafluor647-NPs in glioblastoma-colorectal
cancer cell co-culture
PLGA is an FDA-approved biodegradable, physically
strong and highly biocompatible polymer; especially
suitable as a delivery vehicle for drugs, proteins and other
macromolecules including DNA, RNA and peptides [28–
30]. Reasons for its popularity among various available
biodegradable polymers are its favourable degradation
characteristics and its suitability for sustained drug
delivery. Toxicological studies have designated PLGA as an
extremely safe material for macroscopic and micro particle
systems [31]. Nanoparticles were prepared from a PLGA
polymer using a modified single emulsion evaporation
method [32]. In order to characterize the synthesized
nanoparticles, size and zeta potential of each nanoparticle
batch was measured in a Malvern Zetasizer. Nanoparticles,
which contained Letrozole, (PLGA-Let-NPs) were found
to possess a mean size of 143.6 nm ± 27.84, with a mean
zeta-potential of -21.58 mV ± 0.632 and an encapsulation
efficiency of 82.22% + 5.77. Supplementary Figure 1
Nanoparticle imaging was carried out using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, Figure 4B). As evaluated
through a content release study, there is an initial burst
release of Letrozole within the first 12 hours, with 50% of
content release noted after 50 hours of incubation in both
cell culture media and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at
37°C (Figure 4A). The anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO antibodyNP conjugation protocol, modified from Kocbek et al.
[33] was optimised through positive conjugation verified
by rhodamine fluorescence resulting from anti-mouse-

Assessment of GD2 expression in GBM cells
β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β4GANT1,
GM2/GD2 synthase) is a key enzyme which is responsible
for the synthesis of the glycosphingolipids GM2, GD2,
and GA2. In a previous publication by Woo et al. [16],
disialogangliosidase 2 (GD2) was identified as a GBMspecific antigen, in addition to a glycosphingolipid, CD90.
As an initial screen, a variety of cell lines were assessed
with respect to their relative expression of β4GANT1
mRNA. As a reference, we used cervical cancer HeLa
cells, which have been shown to express β4GANT1
[16]. Cell lines assessed included the colorectal HT29
and lung cancer A549 lines, expressing less or equivalent
amounts of β4GANT1 as the HeLa controls. The GBM
commercial and primary lines, A172, MZ-327 and MZ18
expressed little or no GD2 synthase compared to HeLa
cells, while U251 or patient derived primary RN1 spheroid

expressed significantly higher levels of GD2 synthase
(Figure 3A). Although the commercially available GBM

primary (MZ-327 and RN1) and recurrent (MZ-256 and MZ-304) GBM patient-derived cell lines were assessed by Western blotting for
aromatase expression (50–55 kDa, Abcam, 1:250) with β-actin (1:5000) as a loading control. All clinical data pertaining to patient-derived

Specific delivery to GBM cells using anti-GD2ch14.18/CHO conjugated PLGA nanoparticles

Treatment of GBM cells with anti-GD2-ch14.18/
CHO -PLGA-Let-NPs ± TMZ

Specific cell delivery of potential therapeutics is a
highly relevant issue, especially for diseases such as brain
cancer where off-target drug delivery holds the potential to
cause deleterious adverse effects and toxicity. To evaluate
the potential of anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO antibody to direct
targeted delivery in GBM cells, PLGA-Alexafluor647tagged-NPs were surface activated and coupled to
anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO antibody. HT29 colorectal
cancer cells were pre-incubated with Cell tracker Blue
reagent while MZ-256 GBM cells were incubated with
MitoGreen tracker prior to co-culture on glass bottom
dishes. As shown in Figure 4D, NP positive cells appear
Cyan in the merged image of Blue Cell-tracker-HT29,
Green Mitogreen-MZ-256 and Red-NP. Notably, NP
encapsulation occurs exclusively in mitotically active MZ256 cells as evidenced by their positivity for MitoGreen.

The standard treatment regimen for newly
diagnosed glioblastoma patients is based on the so-called
Stupp protocol [4], involving fractionated radiotherapy
(RT) in combination with temozolomide (TMZ). The
addition of TMZ to RT results in a clinically significant
survival benefit [9]. TMZ is administered with fractionated
radiotherapy and consists of a dose of 75 mg/m2 per
day, given from the first until the last day of RT, but not
longer than 49 days. After a four week break up to six
cycles of adjuvant TMZ at a dose of 150 mg/m2 follow.
Based on the findings of Stupp et al. median survival rate
was increased from 12.1 months with RT alone to 14.6
months with TMZ and RT treatment combination. The
contribution of aromatase to chemoresistance has been
noted for several other cancers [34]. In order to assess
if this may also be the case for GBMs, glioblastoma cell

non-GBM cell lines, qualitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out to asses mRNA expression of the key enzyme responsible for the synthesis
of disialogangliosidase 2 (GD2). The expression levels of β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β4GANT1) mRNA transcript was
assessed in n = 2 non-GBM lines (HT29 and A549), n = 2 commercially available GBM lines (A152 and U251), n = 4 primary GBM-patient
derived lines (MZ-327, MZ-18, RN1spheroid and JK2), n = 2 recurrent GBM lines (MZ-256 and MZ-304) and a glioma initiating cell line
(GIC1080Sp) relative to the cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. As shown (A) RN1spheroid, MZ-256 and MZ-304 have greatest β4GANT1
expression. These highlighted lines were assessed by flow cytometry using a GD2-FITC tagged primary antibody (B) showing positive
GD2 antigen presentation on the surface of these cell types (representative flow of n = 4).

proliferation rates back to basal levels of untreated cells.

DISCUSSION

Assessment of the role of miR-191 in aromatase
inhibitor-induced reduction of GBM cell
proliferation

Previous studies carried out by Dave et al. [41]
investigated the efficacy of the aromatase inhibitor,
Letrozole, on GBM cell growth in vitro and in vivo
exclusively in the conventional human glioma cell lines
and the rat glioma C6 cells. Several studies have shown
that treatment response in established glioma cells differs
greatly to that noted in patient-derived primary cultures
[42, 43]. Therefore, it was of great interest to the authors
to ascertain if aromatase inhibitors manifest an anti-tumor
effect also in primary cultures derived from both primary
and recurrent GBMs, and on patient-derived stem-like
glioma cells. In addition, the possibility of selective
targeting of glioma cells through anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO
conjugated PLGA nanoparticles as an approach to limiting
off target effects was addressed.
Aromatase is a microsomal cytochrome P450
complex coded by the CYP19A1 gene [44]. Aromatase

The microRNA-191 (miR-191) has been implicated
in several cancer types [35–38] showing an active role
in cell proliferation, migration, chemoresistance and
ultimately disease progression. As miR-191 is an estrogenresponsive microRNA [39], and its expression has been
correlated to the aggressive mesenchymal subtype of GBM
[40], it was of interest to evaluate if the treatment with
Letrozole (0.1 µM) (Figure 2) alters miR-191 expression
in glioma cells. Therefore, qPCR was carried out to assess
the effect of aromatase inhibition on levels of miR-191.
The results showed that Letrozole treatment results in a
34.46% ± 4.99 reduction in miR-191 expression relative
to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 6A *p < 0.05). It
was of interest, therefore, to assess if the reduction of

Treatment of both cell lines with anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO-PLGALet-NPs in combination with TMZ significantly reduced cell numbers when compared to anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO-PLGA-Veh-NPs+TMZ
or anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO-PLGA-Let-NPs+DMSO treatments alone (n = 3, mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). Notably,

catalyses the irreversible conversion of androgens to
oestrogens [13] with activity in several normal and cancer
tissues, the latter including brain cancers [14, 45,  46]
and this study. Inhibition of aromatase is promising
for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer,
pathological alterations of ovarian and endometrial
function and some benign disorders like gynecomastia
associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation. As found
in this study, the addition of the aromatase inhibitor,

Letrozole, to patient-derived GBM cultures led to a
significant reduction in proliferation, migration and
gliomasphere forming capacity in vitro. Our findings are
not only concordant with those reported in conventional
glioma cell lines by Dave et al. [41] but also extend these
previous findings to a more clinically relevant experimental
models such as glioma stem cells by integrating cell typespecific targeting approach based on the utilization of
surface biomarkers expressed in GBM cells.

Figure 6: Assessment of miR-191contribution to GBM-letrozole treatment. GBM cells (MZ-304) were treated with

Letrozole (0.1 µM) and qPCR was carried out to assess the effect of aromatase inhibition on the oestrogen response microRNA, miR-191.
Notably, Letrozole treatment resulted in a 34.46% ± 4.99 reduction in miR-191 expression relative to vehicle-treated controls (A), n = 3,
mean ± SEM *p < 0.05). Therefore, the ability of reintroduced synthetics premiR-191 into Letrozole-treated GBM cells to rescue the
reduced-proliferation phenotype was assessed over 120 hours (B). It was found that transient transfection of miR-191 Let-treated MZ-304
cells led to a restoration of ‘normal’ cell proliferation rates, similar to those noted in untreated and DMSO+premiRneg-treated MZ-304 cells
(***p < 0.001, n = 3, mean ± SEM, Two way ANOVA).

In the context of breast cancer, an estrogendependent cancer, where the use of aromatase inhibitors
has been highly researched [47–51], deleterious effects of
non-specific delivery of Letrozole includes osteoporosis
leading to increased bone fractures, joint and muscle pain,
menopausal symptoms, depression, cardiac problems,
increased cholesterol and increased blood pressure were
shown. In this regard, specific delivery of aromataseinhibitors exclusively to target cancer cells using antibody
conjugated biodegradable nanoparticles provides a
promising approach for increasing drug efficacy and
reducing therapeutic side effects. With respect to
GBM, recent studies have shown that several antigens
including cluster of differentiation 90 (CD90, Thy-1)
and GD2 disialoganglioside are frequently overexpressed
in glioblastoma cells [52]. GD2 disialoganglioside is a
sialic-containing glycosphingolipid, also shown to be
overexpressed in neuroblastoma with the GD2 specific
antibody anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO being used in several
neuroblastoma clinical trials [20, 21]. We also reported
previously that the anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO antibody was
successfully used for nanoparticle-mediated specific delivery
of microRNAs to neuroblastoma tumors in vivo [53].
β-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 encoded
by the β4GALNT1 gene is an enzyme responsible for
the biosynthesis of G(M2) and GD2 glycosphingolipids
[54]. As depicted in Figure 3A, β4GALNT1 transcript
expression was assessed as an indicator of GD2 expression
across a panel of human cancer cell lines including
conventional cell lines derived from GBM and patientderived primary cultures of first diagnosed or recurrent
GBM. Our results reveal the benefits of a combinatorial
approach integrating nanoparticles-based delivery of the
aromatase inhibitor Letrozole with the selective antibodymediated cell targeting cell-specific recognition.
Although Letrozole has shown to be capable of
blood-brain barrier (B-BB) transition in rat models of
glioblastoma with high uptake rates into the tumor itself
[55], specific delivery through encapsulation within
biodegradable nanoparticles is a promising avenue of
research and may provide the means to minimize the
adverse effects of current chemotherapeutics in use for
GBM treatment. The intricate composition of the B-BB
ensures the highly regulated and restricted transport of
molecules with limitations further imposed by electrical
resistance across B-BB endothelia [56]. Differences
in nanoparticle material, size and shape and receptor
(over)expression makes it difficult to define optimal
criteria for B-BB diffusions; however, passive transport
typically occurs for lipophilic molecules below 400Da and
through several studies it has been shown that 80–200 nm
nanoparticle size range is optimal for tumour inclusion
and effect [57]. In addition, conjugation of a GD2
specific antibody to the surface of activated Letrozoleencapsulated PLGA-nanoparticles renders GBM cell
specificity. It should be noted that antibody conjugation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significantly alters the cell surface of the nanoparticles
and nanoparticle size as shown in Supplementary Table 2,
presumably due to anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO antibodyantibody aggregation. Such an aggregation causes the
nanoparticles to behave like larger particles [58] and may
affect systemic delivery for therapeutic application in
the brain. However, evaluation of potential therapeutics
through direct intratumoral injection including nanoparticle
delivery to in vivo models of GBM [59, 60] or at the point
of patient tumor resection or biopsy [61–65] in several
studies indicates that such systemic transport challenges
can be circumvented to facilitate therapeutic delivery in a
clinical setting.
Nanoparticle formulation for this study was
based on the protocol by Jana et al. (2014) which used
a single emulsion and evaporation method for letrozole
encapsulation and formulation of PLGA nanoparticles
[32]. Similar to the aforementioned protocol, this study
resulted in the formulation of PLGA-NPs less than 150
nm with an encapsulation efficiency of over 80%. Notably,
however, anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO antibody conjugation
resulted in a dramatic increase in NP size (>360 nm)
which although would affect B-BB penetrance and
cellular diffusion; had no observable bearing on GBM
cellular uptake as a result of direct administration in
this study due to the pharmacokinetics of GD2 antigenantibody endocytosis on the GBM cell surface. Although
these sized NPs would have a significant effect on B-BB
penetrance, treatment protocols for recurrent GBM tumour
resection provides an opportunity for direct therapeutic
administration to the brain tumour cavity; thereby
circumventing the B-BB.
In order to assess whether Letrozole administration
improves chemoresponse to TMZ in GBM cells, antiGD2-ch14.18/CHO-PLGA-Let-NP in combination with
temozolomide (TMZ, 150 µM) treatment in GBM cells in
vitro was assessed. The findings show that the anti-cancer
effects elicited by the Letrozole-nanoparticles in GBM
cells attenuate TMZ-induced reduction in cell numbers
over 72 hours. Although these findings need to be assessed
in an orthotopic model of glioblastoma, this in vitro study
highlights the successful encapsulation and delivery of
functional Letrozole exclusively to GBM cells.
In an attempt to understand the mechanism through
which Letrozole elicits its anti-tumor effect in GBM cells,
the authors evaluated the expression levels of the estrogenresponsive microRNA-191 (miR-191) post-Letrozole
treatments. MiR-191 has been shown to be a prognostic
indicator of poor survival rates in GBM patients [40],
indicating a potential role for hormonal control of GBM
pathogenesis. Oestrogen is synthesised, catalysed by
aromatase, and subsequently binds to the estrogen receptor
(ER) alpha/beta subunits which dynamically interact with
the estrogen responsive elements (ERE) in the promoter
region of miR-191 [39], increasing expression and driving
proliferation, migration and chemoresistance in several

cancer types [54, 66–68]. It is hypothesized that aromatase
inhibition through Letrozole treatment reduces oestrogenmediated binding of the ER to the ERE and therefore
reduces miR-191 expression. In order to assess this
hypothesis the authors investigated the ability of miR-191
to rescue the reduced proliferative phenotype induced by
Letrozole in GBM cells and found that reintroduction of
synthetic premicroRNA-191 led to significant restoration
of ‘normal’ growth patterns of the GBM cell in vitro. In
this regard, it may be of interest to evaluate the therapeutic
merit of miR-191 as a potential anti-tumor molecule for
future studies.
Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain cancer
with an extremely poor prognostic outcome despite
intensive treatment regimes. With an average five year
survival rate of less than 3%, this dismal prognosis
necessitates exploration of novel therapeutics and drug
delivery systems such as those detailed in this study.
The identification of new mechanism-based therapeutic
targets through repurposing of currently approved
clinical drugs, and the use of alternative drug-delivery
strategies such as tumour-specific mediated delivery of
effective anti-cancer drugs, improves upon this bleak
outlook, and is an important agenda with respect to
GBM research.

Glioblastoma cells were washed with 1x Phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) (BioWhittaker®), trypsinised
(Trypsin:EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich®) and centrifuged at
1,200 rpm for 4 minutes. The supernatant was removed
and protein was extracted from the resulting pellet in
Protease inhibitor (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich®) and RIPA
buffer (1M Tis pH 7.4, 5M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 50 mM
NaF, 0.5M EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate).
Resuspended cells in RIPA were left on ice for 20 minutes
before centrifugation at 4°C at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
Supernatant was isolated, quantified using a BCA™
Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored
at –20°C.

Western blot
Western blot analysis was performed on lysates
prepared as outlined previously, or lysates provided from
patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts (G46, G59, G64,
G76, G79, G80, G84, G85 and G91) by Mayo Clinic Brain
Tumor SPORE [24–27]. Clinical data related to these
patient-derived samples are detailed in Supplementary
Table 1. Western blots were carried out using 4–10%
gradient pre-cast gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and TrisHEPES-SDS running buffer (0.1M Tris, 0.1M HEPES,
3 mM SDS, pH 8) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein
samples were mixed with 1x Lamelli buffer containing
1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) (31.5 mM Tris-HCL, pH 6.8;
10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.005% Bromophenol blue, 50
mM DTT). Gels were run at 80V for 45 minutes, followed
by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) at 40V for 90 minutes, in transfer buffer (48
mM Tris, 30 mM Glycine, 0.037% SDS, 2.5% methanol
pH8.3). Blocking buffer (10%-milk-TBST, Marvel, (Tris,
Tween20®) Sigma-Aldrich®) was used to block nonspecific
sites on the membrane at 4°C overnight. Membranes were
incubated with primary anti-P450 antibody (Abcam 1:250
in TBST) at room temperature for 2 hours and washed
with TBST. Secondary anti-rat IgG antibody (Abcam,
1:2000 in TBST) was then added for two hours, followed
by further washes with TBST. For control loading, β-actin
antibody (Abcam, 1:5000 in TBST) was added for one
hour at room temperature. Membranes were washed with
TBST and secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody (Abcam,
1:2000 in TBST) was added for one hour, followed by
further washes with TBST. All membranes were developed
using the Pierce™ ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate
and the images were assessed on a LAS Imager4000.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and patient-derived tumor samples
For all in vitro experiments glioblastoma cell
lines derived from patient GBM tumor biopsies and
from other cancer types such as colorectal (HT29), lung
(A549) and cervical (HeLa) were used. A172 and U251
are commercially available GBM cell lines which, in
addition to the MZ-304, MZ-327 and MZ-256 cell lines
[69, 70] were grown as a monolayer in DMEM media
(BioWhittaker®) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf
serum (FCS; GIBCO), 100U/mL penicillin (SigmaAldrich®), and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich®).
Stem-like glioma initiating cell lines (GICs) established
from human GBMs were previously described [71,
72]. Low-passage primary GBM patient-derived lines,
RN1 and JK2, were kindly donated by the Brain Cancer
Research Unit, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research
Institute, Australia. The cells were grown as a monolayer
(adherent condition) in Serum-Free Human NSC Culture
Medium, as previously described [73], supplemented with
β-FGF and EGF (10 ng/ml and 20 ng/ml respectively)
on 1% matrigel-coated flasks or plates [73] or as a
gliomasphere culture in the absence of matrigel and
presence of heparin (10 ng/µl, Sigma Aldrich). These
RN1 cells stably express luciferase if required. All cells
were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with
5% CO2. Patient clinical data pertaining to the GBM cell
lines used is presented in Supplementary Table 1.

(Applied Biosystems™) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Aromatase mRNA transcript (CYP19A1)
expression was assessed in several cell lines relative to
β-actin by qPCR, using a CYP19A1-specific Taqman probe
(Applied Biosciences) and β-actin as an endogenous gene
control. GD2 expression was assessed using qPCR of the
β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β4GALNT1,
GM2/GD2 synthase) gene using a specific Taqman
probe. Detection of mRNA transcript was carried out
on a StepOne Plus qPCR machine under the following
parameters 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes,
followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15
seconds and 60°C for 60 seconds. Expression levels were
calculated based on the delta delta CT (ΔΔCT) method.

DMSO was dissolved in an acetone - dichloromethane
(1.5 ml 1:2 v/v) mixture. The PLGA-letrozole mixture
was then emulsified with an aqueous phase composed of
2% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution in water (4.5 ml) by
sonication using a micro tip probe sonicator at an output of
50W for 30s in an ice bath. The organic solvents were then
rapidly removed by evaporation at 37ºC leaving behind
colloidal suspension of PLGA NPs containing Letrozole
(PLGA-Let-NPs) or a DMSO control (PLGA-empty-NPs)
in water, which was then pelleted using an ultracentrifuge at
4°C at 30,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Each pellet was washed
with 1.13% w/v NaCl solution to keep the particles small.
This was carried out three times. The resulting pellet was
resuspended in molecular grade water and placed at –80°C
for at least 30 minutes. This was then lyophilized overnight
and the resulting powder was weighed to determine yield.

Fluorescence activated sorting analysis
Log phase GBM cells (2 × 106, MZ-304, MZ-256
and RN1-spheroid) were harvested and stained with GD2FITC antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-53831). Cells were then
analysed by a FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience).

Nanoparticle characterisation
Each nanoparticle preparation was weighed in a sterile
Eppendorf tube and resuspended in molecular grade water.
This suspension was then placed on a Zeta cell and measured
in a Malvern Zetasizer to determine size and zeta potential of
each nanoparticle batch. To determine encapsulation efficiency,
an aliquot of PLGA-Let-NPs (1 mg) was resuspended in
acetone and subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 rpm at 25°C
for 30 min. The amount of drug present in the pellet was
determined using a standard curve, constructed using varying
Letrozole concentrations (0–10 µg/ml in acetone, R2 = 0.9778)
versus absorbance at 238 nm [75]. Encapsulation efficiency
was calculated using the following formula:

Cell proliferation assay
GBM cells (MZ-304, MZ-256 and RN1) were
seeded at 1 × 105cells/well in a 6-well plate (Sarstedt
AG&Co). After 24 hours, media was removed and
replaced by either vehicle control (DMSO)-media (SigmaAldrich®) or Aromatase inhibitor (AI) Letrozole (SigmaAldrich®) supplemented media (0.1 µM). Cells were then
allowed to grow for a further 72 hours and cell numbers
were determined through trypan-blue exclusion.

Encapsulation efficiency (%) = Actual drug loading *(mass) in 1 mg samples x100
Theoretical drug loading in a 1 mg sample

2-Dimensional migration assay (Wound healing/
scratch assay)

Letrozole release was calculated by resuspending
lyophilized PLGA–Let-NPs (1 mg) in PBS (1.2 ml pH 7.4)
and the solution was divided in 6 microfuge tubes (200 μl
each), maintained at 37ºC in a thermo-stable water bath.
After an appropriate time period (1 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr,
96 hr and 120 hr) the solution was centrifuged at 3000
rpm. Absorbance of this sample supernatant was measured
at 238 nm. Concentration of the released Let was then
calculated using the standard curve of the respective drug
(0–10 µg/ml, R2 = 0.9966). The percentage of Let released
was determined from the following equation:

In order to test the migratory potential of cells posttreatment with DMSO as a control or Letrozole (Let,
0.1 µM), GBM cells (MZ-304, MZ-256 and RN1) were
seeded at 1x104cells per side of a 2D Migration chamber
(Ibidi GmbH) and allowed to grow to confluency. After 24
hours, the separator was detached using sterile tweezers,
DMSO or Letrozole (0.1 µM) supplemented media was
added and initial ‘wound’ images were taken. Cells
were allowed to grow for 24 hours and the extent of cell
movement was determined by taking an image after the
incubation time, relative to the DMSO-treated control.

Note: For release, Starting mass of NPs was 1 mg,
divided across 6 eppendorfs (therefore there was 0.17 mg
in each tube containing 200 µl).

Letrozole (Let) loading of PLGA nanoparticles was
carried out according to the modified single-emulsion
evaporation method outlined by Jana et al. [32], modified
from [74]. Briefly, PLGA 50:50 (Resomer 503H 200
mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) polymer was dissolved in an
organic phase of chloroform. Letrozole (10 mg) or control

were resuspended in sterile filtered MES buffer
(4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid, pH 5.5) (SigmaAldrich®) and shaken at room temperature for 1 hour. After
centrifugation at 4°C at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes the
MES buffer was discarded, giving a pellet of activated NPs.
EDC-(N-[3-Dimethylaminopropyl]-N-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride) NHS-(N-Hydroxysuccinimide) (SigmaAldrich®) 1xPBS-mix at a 8:8:1 ratio was prepared. Both,
the EDC-NHS-1xPBS-mix and anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO
antibody were added to the activated NPs, which were
then shaken at room temperature overnight. The antiGD2-ch14.18/CHO antibody was made available by a
European funding effort by charities and commissioned
by SIOPEN. This project is now further developed by
APEIRON Biologics.  A centrifugation at 4°C at 13,000
rpm for 20 minutes followed. The washing steps included a
resuspension of the pellet in 1xPBS (0.01M; pH 7.15) and
a further centrifugation as previously, which was repeated
twice. The resulting pellet was resuspended in nucleasefree water and placed at -80°C for at least 30 minutes. NPs
were then lyophilized overnight and the resulting powder
was weighed to determine yield.

1 mg/ml. Based on the determined average encapsulation
efficiency of 82%, 8.2 mg (2.87 µM) of Letrozole was
calculated to be present per mg of NP resuspended in
1 ml of media. Accordingly, an appropriate amount of
resuspended NP was added to the cell culture media to
ensure a final concentration of 0.1 µM of Letrozole. NPs
were removed after 6 hours and temozolomide (TMZ) or
DMSO vehicle control-supplemented (150 µM) cell media
was used. Cells were then allowed to grow for a further
72 hours and cell numbers were assessed.

PremiR-191 rescue experiment of Letrozoletreated GBM (MZ-304) cells
GBM cells (MZ-304) were transiently transfected
with premiR-191 (30 nM, Applied Biosystems) using
siPORT NeoFx transfection reagent (Applied Biosystems).
In brief, MZ-304 cells were seeded (1 × 104 cells) into a T25
flask in normal cell culture media. After 6 hours, to allow
adherence, media was replaced with control (DMSO) or
Letrozole (0.1 µM)-supplemented media and proliferation
rates were determined using trypan blue exclusion at various
time points. After 40 hours, MZ-304 ± Letrozole cells
were transiently reverse transfected with control negative
(premiR-neg) or synthetic precursor miR-191 (premiR-191)
and returned to assess subsequent growth.

Assessment of GBM-specificity using anti-GD2ch14.18/CHO-PLGA-Alexafluor647-NPs in a
glioblastoma-colon cancer cell co-culture

Statistical analysis

In order to assess the ability of anti-GD2-ch14.18/
CHO antibody to direct nanoparticle-mediated drug
delivery to GBM cells, a co-culture system was generated
involving the GBM cell line MZ-256 and the colorectal
cell line (HT29). HT29 colorectal cancer cells (1 × 105)
were pre-incubated with Cell tracker Blue reagent (25 µM)
while MZ-256 GBM cells (1 × 105) were incubated with
MitoGreen tracker (50 nM) prior to co-culture on glass
bottom dishes in DMEM-10%FCS media. To enable
visualisation of nanoparticle delivery PLGA-nanoparticles
were generated which encapsulated an Alexafluor647
fluorophore. This fluorescent tag is only detectable after
PLGA-NP degradation and content release. Anti-GD2ch14.18/CHO-PLGA-Alexafluoro647-NPs were synthesized
and added for a 6 hour period, removed and cells were
assessed by fluorescent microscopy after 96 hours.

For comparison of multiple unpaired samples,
OneWay ANOVA was used with Kruskal-Wallis H Test;
while for direct comparison of two unpaired biological
samples, Mann Whitney u test was used in PrismGraph Pad. All assays were carried out with technical
repeats of n  = 2–3 and in biological triplicate and the
values presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
***p < 0.001.
