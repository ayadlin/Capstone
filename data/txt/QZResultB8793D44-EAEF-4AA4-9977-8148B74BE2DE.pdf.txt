to mitotic microtubules and not interphase microtubules (7), KSP
inhibitors are more selective to mitotic cells compared with other
antimitotic drugs. In addition, because KSP inhibitors do not target
microtubules, they provide an opportunity for specificity and
improved side effect profile over anti-microtubule drugs, such as
Taxol, which exhibits undesired side effects, such as neuropathy.
Sustained arrest due to mitotic spindle disruption, such as that
mediated by the antimitotic drugs Taxol and monastrol, often
triggers apoptosis. Taxol has been shown to initiate apoptosis
through multiple mechanisms (8, 9). KSP inhibitors induce mitotic
arrest by a mechanism different from Taxol, but whether similar
apoptotic pathways are triggered as a consequence of arrest is
unclear.
Mechanisms of cell death induced by KSP inhibitors are
beginning to be elucidated. Leizerman et al. have shown that
monastrol can induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization in
two human cell lines (10). The mitochondria or intrinsic death
pathway is one of two major caspase-dependent death pathways
activated by anticancer drugs (11, 12). Several studies have
correlated the impaired induction of apoptosis in response to
chemotherapeutics with overexpression of the mitochondriaassociated Bcl-2 family proteins (13, 14). An inhibitor of Bcl-2
family proteins has been shown to have synergistic cytotoxic effects
with chemotherapeutics, resulting in regression of solid tumors
(15). Posttranslational modification of Bcl-2 by phosphorylation
has also been indicated as another level of functional regulation
(16). Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 has been detected in Taxol-treated
cells and has been suggested as one of the mechanisms by which
Taxol induces apoptosis in cancer cells (17, 18). The extrinsic
apoptotic pathway mediated by death receptors, such as Fas, tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and TNF
receptor 1, is the second major pathway cells use to commit
apoptosis (11). Activation of the extrinsic death pathway, mediated
by Fas/Fas ligand (FasL; CD95/APO1), has been reported with Taxol
in human malignant glioma cells (19). Activation of the Fas
receptor pathway has been shown to enhance the anticancer effect
of Taxol and other chemotherapeutic agents in human soft tissue
sarcoma cells (20). Recently, small-molecule cytotoxic agents that
sensitize resistant tumor cells to death receptor ligand stimulation
have been identified using a novel high-throughput screen (21).
In a recent report, it was proposed that activation of the spindle
checkpoint followed by mitotic slippage is required to trigger KSP
inhibitor–induced apoptosis (22). Cells with chromosomal instability, which is associated with mitotic checkpoint defects, have a
low mitotic index and exit mitosis prematurely after treatment
with mitotic drugs (23, 24). There are conflicting reports of whether
impairment of the spindle checkpoint inhibits or sensitizes cells
to apoptosis with anti-microtubule drugs (25, 26). Studies from
our lab have shown that cells, in which the spindle checkpoint is
compromised as a result of BubR1 or Mad2 depletion, undergo

Abstract
Targeting the mitotic motor kinesin kinesin spindle protein
(KSP) is a new strategy for cancer therapy. We have examined
the molecular events induced by KSP inhibition and explored
possible mechanisms of resistance and sensitization of tumor
cells to KSP inhibitors. We found that KSP inhibition induced
cell death primarily via activation of the mitochondrial death
pathway. In HeLa cells, inhibition of KSP by small-molecule
inhibitor monastrol resulted in mitotic arrest and rapid
caspase activation. BclXL phosphorylation and loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential was detected before
significant caspase activation, which was required to trigger
the subsequent apoptotic pathway. In A549 cells, however, KSP
inhibition did not induce mitochondrial damage, significant
caspase activity, or cell death. A549 cells aberrantly exited
mitosis, following a prolonged drug-induced arrest, and
arrested in a G1-like state with 4N DNA content in a p53dependent manner. Overexpression of BclXL provided a
protective mechanism, and its depletion rescued the apoptotic
response to monastrol. In addition, Fas receptor was upregulated in A549 cells in response to monastrol. Treatment
with Fas receptor agonists sensitized the cells to monastrolinduced cell death, following exit from mitosis. Thus, activation of the death receptor pathway offered another mechanism
to enhance KSP inhibitor–induced apoptosis. This study has
elucidated cellular responses induced by KSP inhibitors, and
the results provide insights for a more effective cancer
treatment with these agents. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):237–45]

Introduction
Kinesin spindle protein (KSP; Eg5) is one of several microtubule
associated motor proteins that are required for proper spindle
dynamics (1). KSP is required early in mitosis to separate the
centrosomes and form the bipolar mitotic spindle (2). Consequently, KSP inhibitors, such as monastrol (3), prevent centrosome
separation and generate a monoastral spindle phenotype (4, 5),
triggering mitotic arrest and eventual apoptosis. Monastrol, a
selective allosteric inhibitor of KSP ATPase activity, was one of the
first small-molecule inhibitors identified in a phenotype-based
screen (3). KSP inhibitors have been shown to exhibit antitumor
activity and are currently in clinical trials (6). Because KSP localizes

Tween 20 (TBS-T). Primary antibodies used were anti–poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (anti-PARP; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti–cyclin E (in
house), anti–cytochrome c (BD PharMingen), anti-BclXL (Cell Signaling),
anti-KSP (BD Biosciences), anti-p53 (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), anti-p21
(Neomarkers, Fremont, CA), and anti–h-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at
recommended concentrations. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and
incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or antimouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
Chemiluminescence was detected with Pierce Supersignal Westpico.
Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (Mitotracker) assay.
Mitochondrial integrity was assayed with the mitochondrial dye Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were treated with
monastrol or DMSO as described above. After indicated times, the cells
were incubated with 100 nmol/L dye for 45 min at 37jC under 5% CO2. Cells
were then collected, washed with PBS, resuspended in PBS + 1% FBS, and
analyzed by FACS. The dye intensity was measured in the FL1 channel.
siRNA knockdown. siRNA duplexes to knockdown BclXL, p53, and KSP
mRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). BclXL target
sequence used was 5¶-AGCAUAUCAGAGCUUUGAA-3¶. KSP target sequence
used was 5¶-GAAACTAAATTACAACTTG-3¶ (31). A luciferase siRNA duplex
(5¶-CAUUCUAUCCUCUAGAGGAUG-3¶) was used as a control. Transient
transfection of siRNA duplexes was done as described in Tanudji et al., using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as the transfection reagent
(32). p53 target sequence used was 5¶-AAGACTCCAGTGGTA ATCTAC-3¶
(33). A p53 siRNA expression cassette with puromycin selective marker or an
empty cassette was cloned into pLXSN vector (BD Biosciences) as described
(33). A retroviral stock was generated by transfecting GP293 cells with
p53 hairpin siRNA construct and VSVG (virus envelope) construct using
Opti-MEM transfection reagent. A549 and A2780 cell line stably expressing
p53 siRNA was generated by infecting cells with the retrovirus and then
selecting several clonal cell lines lacking p53 under puromycin selection.
Results shown are representative of at least three individual clones.
Expression analysis by real-time quantitative PCR. RNA was isolated
using the RNeasy method, according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA (5 Ag) was subjected to treatment with
DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). DNase-treated
total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Gene-specific
primers were designed using Primer Express (PE Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Two unlabeled primers at 900 nmol/L each were used with 250 nmol/L
of FAM-labeled probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a Taqman
real-time quantitative PCR reaction on an ABI 7700 sequence detection
system. Ubiquitin levels were measured in a separate reaction and used to
normalize the data by the D2DC t method.
Cell surface expression analysis by flow cytometry. Following drug
treatment, attached and floating cells were collected and washed with 1
PBS + 1% FBS. Cells were then incubated with either control antibody (IgG)
or anti–Fas receptor antibody (ZB4, Upstate) at 500 ng/mL for 1 h at 4jC.
Cells were washed 2 with 1 PBS + 1% FBS and incubated with antimouse FITC for 1 h at 4jC. Cells were washed and resuspended in 1 PBS +

apoptosis in response to Taxol and monastrol following mitotic
slippage, suggesting that activation of the spindle checkpoint may
not be required for KSP inhibitor–induced apoptosis (27). Some cells
can, however, override a functionally activated spindle checkpoint
and aberrantly exit mitosis without undergoing cell division. Studies
have shown that following a transient mitotic arrest, nocodazoletreated fibroblasts arrest in a G1-like state (28). This phenomenon
of adaptation (29), after a failure in cytokinesis in the presence of
mitotic drugs, has been reported to depend on p53 (30).
In this study, we have further elucidated the cellular responses
following monastrol-induced mitotic arrest. We have examined
activation of the intrinsic or mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and
the role of mitochondria associated proteins in KSP inhibition–
induced cell death. We have also examined the role of the extrinsic
or death receptor pathway in modulating the apoptotic response to
monastrol.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatment. HeLa cells, A549 cells, and A2780 cells
were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/mL and 100 Ag/mL, respectively) at 37jC
and 5% CO2. A549 and A2780 cells stably expressing p53 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) hairpin were maintained in above medium supplemented with
1.5 mg/mL puromycin. Cells were plated at a density of 5  105 and treated
with either 200 Amol/L monastrol (Tocris Cookson, Inc., Ellisville, MS) or
control (0.1% DMSO). Where indicated, caspase inhibitor VI (Calbiochem,
San Diego, CA) or DMSO was added to the cells at the time of drug treatment
at a final concentration of 100 Amol/L. IN addition, where indicated, either a
control antibody (IgM), 40 ng/mL Fas receptor activating antibody (CH11,
Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), or 5 ng recombinant FasL (Upstate) was added to
the cells at the time of drug treatment.
Mitotic arrest assay/DNA content analysis. Following drug treatment
at various times indicated, attached and floating cells were collected,
washed in PBS, and then fixed overnight in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were
washed with wash buffer (1% FBS, 0.3 mg/mL saponin in PBS) and
incubated with 100 AL of 5 Ag/mL anti-MPM-2 antibody (Upstate; diluted in
wash buffer) for 1 h on ice. The cells were washed in wash buffer and
resuspended in a 1:50 dilution of anti-mouse IgG-FITC antibody (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ) and incubated for 1 h on ice. The cells were then washed
again with wash buffer and resuspended in 400 AL propidium iodide/RNase I
solution (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). After 1 h on ice, the cells were
analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The percentage of cells stained with MPM-2
antibody was quantified using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) as
mitotic-arrested population. FACS analysis was also used to determine the
percentage of cells containing 4N or >4N DNA content.
Caspase activity assay. Following drug treatment attached and floating,
cells were collected and resuspended in medium. A carboxyfluorescein
caspase detection kit (Biocarta, San Diego, CA) was used according to
protocol to measure activation of general caspases. Activated caspases
were quantified by FACS analysis using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickson,
San Diego, CA) and CellQuest software.
Western blot analysis. Following drug treatment, attached and floating
cells were collected, washed with PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10%
glycerol, protease inhibitors]. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and
assayed for protein concentration. For membrane and cytosolic preparations, the adherent and floating cells were incubated in homogenizing
buffer (250 mmol/L sucrose, 20 nmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA and EGTA, protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min.
Cells were then passed thorough a 26-gauge needle 10 times and
centrifuged at 750  g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at
100,000  g for 1 h at 4jC. Cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer as indicated
above; 30 Ag total protein was loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with 5% milk in TBS

Results
Monastrol induced mitotic arrest and mitochondrial damage followed by caspase activation in mitotically arrested
HeLa cells. Microtubule poisons, such as vinblastine and Taxol,
induce a mitotic block in cells, due to the activation of the spindle
checkpoint (29), resulting in apoptotic cell death (34, 35). We first
examined the kinetics of monastrol-induced arrest and cell death
in asynchronously growing HeLa cells. HeLa cells treated with
monastrol for 16 h arrested in mitosis as determined by the
accumulation of phosphorylated MPM-2 signal, a marker for the
mitotic stage of the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). Monastrol induced a dosedependent arrest of HeLa and other cell lines in mitosis, with
maximum arrest observed with 200 Amol/L concentration by

caspases occurred in mitotically arrested cells. PARP cleavage
observed in cells treated with monastrol was also inhibited in cells
pretreated with the caspase inhibitor (Fig. 1C). Monastrol-treated
cells showed increased cyclin B levels (Fig. 1C) and a decreased
cdc2-Tyr15 phosphorylation levels (data not shown), both of which
are markers for the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. The absence of
cyclin E (Fig. 1C), a marker for G1 phase of the cell cycle, showed
that HeLa cells treated with monastrol did not exit mitosis
following arrest in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitor.
This was consistent with time lapse analysis of cells treated with
monastrol, showing that following mitotic arrest, the monoaster
cells underwent apoptosis without mitotic exit (27). Together, these
results indicate that in HeLa cells, caspase activation and cell death
are triggered in mitosis as a result of drug-induced mitotic arrest.

16 h that was comparable with mitotic arrest induced with
50 nmol/L Taxol (data not shown; ref. 27). There was a rapid
increase in caspase activity followed by an accumulation of cells in
the sub-G1 compartment (Fig. 1A). Maximum mitotic arrest and
activation of caspases was detected within 16 h, and the decrease
in arrested cells by 24 h was due to significant induction of cell
death (increase in caspase activity and sub-G1 cells). Within 36 h of
monastrol treatment, the majority of cells underwent apoptosis
(data not shown). Cleavage of PARP, a marker for cells undergoing
apoptosis, in monastrol-treated cells confirmed the induction of
apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of caspase activity by
caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk) not only reversed monastrolinduced cell death (sub-G1 population) but also prolonged the
arrest of cells in mitosis (Fig. 1B), suggesting that activation of

detected with up to 96 h of treatment with monastrol (Fig. 2C).
Instead, as indicated by the loss of MPM-2 signal, monastroltreated cells exited mitosis and arrested in a post-mitotic G1 state
with 4N DNA content (Fig. 2A). This post-mitotic G1 phase arrest
was p53 dependent because in the absence of p53, monastroltreated cells exhibited endoreduplication with little further
increases in caspase activity or cell death, resulting in aneuploidy
cells with 8N DNA content (Supplementary Fig. S1). p53 and its
target p21 were up-regulated in A549 cells in response to monastrol
(data not shown). The aberrant mitotic exit of cells with 4N DNA
content to G1 state after 48 h of monastrol treatment was
confirmed by increased cyclin E levels and decreased cyclin B levels
(Fig. 2C) and cdc2-Tyr15 dephosphorylation (data not shown).
Some PARP cleavage was, however, detected in these cells after
48 h of treatment with Taxol, at which time cells have exited
mitosis (Fig. 2C). The low level of sub-G1 cells observed with
monastrol could be reversed by pretreatment of the cells with a
caspase inhibitor (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, the percentage
of cells with 4N DNA content increased without a corresponding
increase in MPM-2–positive cells. These results indicated that
unlike HeLa cells, A549 cells did not accumulate in mitosis in the
absence of caspase activation. Thus, A549 cells exited mitosis
without cell division following drug-induced arrest irrespective of
caspase activation. We next analyzed mitochondrial membrane
damage in these cells in response to monastrol and found that
monastrol failed to induce any mitochondrial damage. No decrease
in Mitotracker dye intensity was detected with 24 and 48 h of
monastrol treatment (Fig. 2D ). These results suggest that

Because the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria plays a
key role in the activation of caspases, we examined whether
monastrol induced mitochondrial damage with a subsequent
release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Mitochondrial damage
was determined by a decrease in the intensity of mitochondrial dye
as a result of loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
Monastrol-treated cells showed decreased intensity of mitochondrial dye (Fig. 1D, M2) with time. The loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential correlated with the release of cytochrome
c into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, bottom). Following monastrol
treatment, cytochrome c was detected in the cytoplasmic
compartment by 16 h. Pretreatment with caspase inhibitor
(Z-VAD-fmk) partially blocked drug-induced mitochondrial damage, indicating some requirement for the activation of initiator
caspases upstream of mitochondrial damage (data not shown).
In A549 cells, monastrol induced a sustained mitotic arrest,
but cells exited mitosis to a G1-like state without activation of
the mitochondrial death pathway. Monastrol induced a dosedependent and sustained mitotic arrest, up to 24 h of drug
treatment, in non–small cell lung carcinoma A549 cells (data not
shown; Fig. 2A). An increase in the MPM-2–positive cells with
16- and 24-h drug treatment corresponded with the accumulation
of cells with 4N DNA content. However, no increase in caspase
activity, sub-G1 population (Fig. 2A), or PARP cleavage (Fig. 2C) was
detected with 24-h drug treatment. Time course analysis (Fig. 2A)
revealed that after 48 h of treatment with monastrol, caspase
activity was only slightly increased; however, there was no
accumulation of sub-G1 cells. In addition, no PARP cleavage was

KSP Inhibition–Induced Mechanism of Apoptosis

monastrol is unable to activate the mitochondrial death pathway
and trigger cell death in A549 cells.
Effect of KSP inhibition on the antiapoptotic protein BclXL.
We next investigated the effect of monastrol on several mitochondria-associated proteins that could mediate the response to KSP
inhibition. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) expression analysis revealed that the mitochondria-associated antiapoptotic protein BclXL was overexpressed in A549 cells compared
with HeLa cells. There was little change in BclXL mRNA or protein
levels in monastrol-treated cells compared with DMSO-treated cells
(Fig. 3A). We observed that in HeLa cells, monastrol induced
phosphorylation of BclXL by 16 h as indicated by band shift
(Fig. 3B). BclXL phosphorylation was also detected in A2780
ovarian carcinoma cells in response to monastrol. A2780 cells
exhibited a strong mitotic arrest phenotype in response to
monastrol at 16 h. Increased caspase activity by 24 h with
significant cell death was detected with 48-h drug treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2). A2780 cells, however, were also susceptible to mitotic slippage and exhibited p53-dependent endoreduplication (Supplementary Fig. S2) similar to A549 cells. However, no
BclXL phosphorylation was detected in A549 cells in response to
monastrol (Fig. 3B). All these cell lines showed little or no
expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, as determined by either
quantitative RT-PCR expression analysis or by Western blot
analysis (data not shown). Phosphorylation of BclXL was also
detected in HeLa cells depleted in KSP protein by siRNA (Fig. 3C).
HeLa cells treated with KSP siRNA duplex showed depletion of KSP
protein after 40 h, at which time BclXL protein band shift was
detected, suggesting that BclXL phosphorylation was a consequence of KSP inhibition–induced mitotic arrest. The appearance
of BclXL band shift in drug-treated and KSP-depleted cells
coincides with the activation of the apoptotic pathway. These
results show that KSP inhibition induces phosphorylation of BclXL,
thereby activating the mitochondrial death pathway following
arrest of cells in mitosis.
Antiapoptotic protein BclXL plays a key role in resistance to
monastrol-induced death. We further investigated the resistance
of A549 cells to monastrol-induced apoptosis by examining the role
of BclXL in the response to monastrol. A549 cells lacking BclXL
were generated using siRNA depletion. Cells were transfected with
either luciferase siRNA or BclXL siRNA duplexes, and cell lysates
were analyzed 48 and 72 h after transfection. Transfection with a
BclXL siRNA duplex resulted in significant depletion of BclXL
protein (Fig. 4A) and the knockdown lasted up to 96 h after
transfection. Twenty-four hours after transfection with siRNA, the
cells were treated with monastrol for up to 72 h to analyze their
mitotic arrest, caspase activity, and cell death profile. Interestingly,
in the absence of BclXL, monastrol induced a marked increase in
caspase activity and cell death with time that was not detected in
luciferase-transfected cells treated with monastrol (Fig. 4B). No
increase in caspase activity or cell death was detected in BclXLdepleted cells treated with DMSO (data not shown), suggesting that
BclXL depletion alone does not trigger apoptosis. Thus, BclXL
depletion sensitized cells to mitotic drug-induced apoptosis.
We then tested the ability of monastrol to induce mitochondrial
damage in these cells (Fig. 4C). BclXL-depleted cells treated with
monastrol showed significant mitochondrial damage, as indicated
by a decrease in the intensity of the mitochondrial dye (M2), within
24 h. No mitochondrial damage was observed in luciferasetransfected cells treated with monastrol. In addition, no mitochondrial damage was detected in BclXL-depleted cells treated

with DMSO. Thus, BclXL depletion can rescue the apoptotic
response to monastrol in A549 cells. These results suggest that the
overexpression of BclXL and/or its inability to be phosphorylated
in A549 cells in response to monastrol-induced mitotic arrest
prevents activation of the mitochondrial death pathway.
Fas receptor agonists synergize with antimitotic drugs. We
next examined whether monastrol could modulate expression of
other proteins associated with the apoptotic machinery of the cell.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the Fas receptor mRNA
was up-regulated in monastrol-treated A549 cells (Fig. 5A). Increase
in the cell surface expression of Fas receptor, with time, was also
detected in response to monastrol in A549 and A2780 cells
(Fig. 5B). Depletion of p53 in both the cell lines inhibited the upregulation of Fas receptor mRNA and cell surface protein
expression (Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that drug-induced Fas

receptor by Fas receptor–activating antibody significantly enhanced
caspase activation and cell death (sub-G1 population) in monastroltreated cells but not DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 5C). Activation of
the Fas receptor by recombinant FasL also significantly enhanced
monastrol-induced caspase activity that was inhibited by anti–
FasL-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 5D). Similarly, p53-dependent
Fas receptor up-regulation and Fas agonist–induced enhanced cell
death was also observed with Taxol (data not shown). Thus, Fas
receptor agonists (Fas receptor–activating antibody or recombinant
FasL) can enhance cell death in combination with the antimitotic
drugs but do not induce cell death by themselves. In addition, no
increase in caspase activity and cell death was detected when cells
were treated with monastrol in combination with anti–Fas receptor
antibody for 16 h (Supplementary Fig. S3), at which time cells are
still in drug-induced mitotic arrest. This suggests that Fas receptor
agonists potentiate monastrol-induced cell death following
mitotic exit in cells susceptible to mitotic slippage. In addition,
anti–Fas receptor antibody–induced caspase activity and cell death
was inhibited in p53-depleted cells treated with monastrol
compared with cells wild type for p53 (Fig. 5C). These results
suggest that KSP inhibitor–induced up-regulation of Fas receptor
sensitizes the post-mitotic G1 phase arrested cells to Fas receptor
agonist–mediated death that is p53 dependent.

Discussion
Disruption of the mitotic spindle has been a successful strategy
for cancer therapeutics. Inhibition of the mitotic motor kinesin
protein KSP/Eg5 is a novel method to target the mitotic spindle.
Inhibition of KSP with small-molecule inhibitors, such as
monastrol, or KSP depletion by siRNA induced arrest of cells in
mitosis. The mitotic arrest phenotype was observed in HeLa cells
(Fig. 1), A549 cells (Fig. 2), and A2780 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2),
suggesting that these cells activated the mitotic spindle checkpoint
(36, 37). In HeLa cells, monastrol induced rapid activation of
caspases in mitosis as a consequence of mitotic arrest (Fig. 1).
Inhibition of caspase activity not only inhibited cell death but also
prolonged arrest of the cells in mitosis (Fig. 1). Expression of cyclin
B and the absence of cyclin E accumulation, in the presence or
absence of caspase inhibitor, indicated that HeLa cells did not exit
mitosis. A549 cells, on the other hand, underwent mitotic slippage
following prolonged KSP inhibition–induced mitotic arrest. However, no significant caspase activation or cell death was detected
either during the arrest or following mitotic slippage. Instead, these
cells arrested in a post-mitotic G1-like phase without undergoing
cell division (Fig. 2). Thus, inhibition of caspase activity affected the
kinetics of cell death but not the kinetics of mitotic exit. Similarly,
A2780 cells also underwent mitotic slippage after monastrolinduced mitotic arrest but, unlike A549 cells, showed increased
caspase activity and cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2). Together,
these results suggest that exit from mitosis does not correlate with
induction of apoptosis in response to monastrol.
Aberrant mitotic exit without cytokinesis has been shown to
activate a p53-mediated tetraploidy checkpoint (38). Indeed,
monastrol induced up-regulation of p53 in A549 cells similar to
anti-microtubule drugs. Depletion of p53 protein in A549 and
A2780 cells resulted in endoreduplication (Supplementary Figs. S1
and S2). The predominant phenotype of endoreduplication was
observed only after 48 h of drug treatment, at which time cells have
undergone mitotic slippage into G1 phase. However, endoreduplication was accompanied with little increase in A549 cell death,

a key component of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, we next
examined whether activation of the up-regulated Fas receptor
could sensitizes the cells to monastrol. Activation of the Fas

and that BclXL, the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, is a key
player in monastrol-induced apoptosis. Although the mechanisms
responsible for mitochondrial membrane permeabilization are
unclear, the Bcl-2 family proteins have emerged as key regulators
(41). BclXL, and not Bcl-2, is predominantly expressed in HeLa,
A549, and A2780 cells (data not shown). BclXL mRNA, as well as
protein, was expressed at significantly higher levels in A549 cells
compared with HeLa cells (Fig. 3). The enforced overexpression of
Bcl-2 into most cell types has been shown to confer resistance to
cell death signals (42). Studies in patients with several types of
leukemia’s, non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and
prostate cancer support the hypothesis that high-level expression
of Bcl-2 family proteins confers a clinically important chemoresistant phenotype (43). Thus, an imbalance in the ratios of

suggesting their inability to undergo cell death in response to
monastrol. In addition, HeLa cells, which are inherently p53
deficient (expressing human papillomavirus E6) and which when
depleted in the checkpoint proteins BubR1 and Mad2, also
aberrantly exit mitosis and undergo endoreduplication. Unlike
A549 cells, however, checkpoint-deficient HeLa cells eventually
undergo apoptosis (27). Thus, based on our results, there seems to
be no coupling of the induction of apoptosis to mitotic slippage as
proposed by Tao et al. (22). Rather, failure to undergo cell death
suggests an inability to activate the apoptotic machinery.
Activation of the caspase cascade characterizes cells undergoing
apoptosis (39) and can be triggered by the mitochondrial or death
receptor apoptotic pathway (40). Our results indicate that KSP
inhibition primarily activates the mitochondrial death pathway,

by itself but sensitized cells to mitotic drug-induced death (data
not shown; Fig. 4). This is consistent with recent data that showed
that a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 family proteins enhanced
the apoptotic effects of chemotherapeutics and radiation in non–
small cell lung cancer (15).
Several studies have shown that chemotherapeutic agents can
modulate expression of genes that could be targets for combination
therapy (48, 49). Combination of topoisomerase inhibitor CPT-11
with a cytotoxic antibody to the cell surface antigen whose
expression is induced by CPT-11 resulted in a synergistic tumor
regression as opposed to either agent alone (50). Our data indicated
that Fas receptor expression was significantly up-regulated in
response to monastrol in A549 and A2780 cells in a p53-dependent
manner (Fig. 5). No increase in FasL levels was detected in response
to monastrol (data not shown). This is consistent with reports that
Fas receptor expression is increased and dependent on p53,
following cytotoxic drug treatment (51). Activation of the Fas
receptor induced cell death in monastrol-treated A549 cells with
significant increase in caspase activity and cell death observed after
cells exited mitosis (Fig. 5). Fas receptor agonists enhanced the
sensitivity of A549 cells to monastrol but did not induce cell death
alone. Thus, it seems that cells susceptible to mitotic slippage that
are wild type for p53 can be sensitized to KSP inhibitors and antimicrotubule drugs, such as Taxol, by activating the extrinsic death
receptor–mediated apoptotic pathway.
A successful anticancer therapeutic strategy requires not only a
better understanding of how apoptosis is triggered but also a need
to overcome inherent resistance of many transformed cells to
apoptosis. Our studies, with continuous or transient treatment and
release, with potent high-affinity KSP inhibitors showed identical
results to monastrol, which is a relatively weak KSP inhibitor.1
Potent KSP inhibitors that target the same site as monastrol have
shown good efficacy in tumor models (6). Thus, based on our
studies with monastrol and other potent small-molecule KSP
inhibitors, we propose that inhibition of KSP activates the intrinsic
death pathway during arrest of cells in mitosis. KSP inhibitor–
induced apoptosis can be induced by simultaneous inhibition of
BclXL in cells resistant to mitochondrial death. In cells susceptible
to slippage following drug-induced arrest, apoptosis can be
triggered or enhanced by activation of the extrinsic death pathway
via stimulation of drug-induced Fas receptor expression (Fig. 6).
This study furthers our understanding of the biology of KSP
inhibition and can help in selecting tumor types or potential drug
combinations for a more effective cancer treatment.

Figure 6. Proposed model of KSP inhibition–induced apoptosis. Inhibition of
BclXL, a component of the intrinsic death pathway, or activation of Fas receptor,
up-regulated in response to monastrol in a p53-dependent manner, a component
of the extrinsic pathway, enhances KSP inhibitor–induced cell death.

antiapoptotic and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members that favors
survival can render tumor cells more resistant to cell death stimuli.
Overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins alone, however, may not be
enough to render cells resistant to apoptosis. Expression levels of
Bcl-2 family proteins in tumor samples of patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia did not always correlate with outcomes or
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs (44). Posttranslational
modification, such as phosphorylation, has been implicated as
another level of functional regulation of the Bcl-2 family proteins
(45). Anti-microtubule drug–induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and
BclXL is thought to modulate the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2
proteins and thus contribute to apoptosis (46, 47). BclXL was
phosphorylated in monastrol-treated HeLa and A2780 cells and in
KSP-depleted HeLa cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that BclXL phosphorylation is a consequence of antimitotic drug-induced arrest.
Phosphorylation of BclXL in response to monastrol was not
observed in A549 cells (Fig. 3). However, BclXL depletion in A549
cells dramatically restored the apoptotic response to monastrol
(Fig. 4). Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cell death
were induced within 16 h of monastrol treatment, at which time
cells are still in mitotic arrest. Thus, phosphorylation of BclXL in
response to antimitotic drug-induced arrest may play a role in
inhibiting the antiapoptotic function of BclXL. Neutralization of
BclXL by siRNA depletion of the protein did not induce cell death
