cancer patients (9–12). Taken together, the evidence suggests that
Wnt pathway activation may have opposing functions that depend
on the specific ligand/receptor combination. Because of the
multiple functions of the Wnt family, inhibition of all Wnt signaling
may not be a perfect strategy for tumor therapy. One solution
would be to target only Wnt signaling molecules that contribute
significantly to tumorigenesis.
A promising way to investigate the role of specific Wnt molecules
in tumorigenesis is to observe whether inhibition of their signaling
causes tumor promotion or suppression. For example, we have
shown that silencing of the Wnt16 and Wnt1 genes suppressed the
growth of pre-B leukemia cells and lung cancer cells, respectively
(4, 13). Small-molecule drugs that inhibit Wnt signaling can be used
to test our hypothesis that Wnt signaling promote the growth of
lung cancers. Such drugs can be rationally designed by targeting
the Frizzled (Frz) family of Wnt receptors, which relay Wnt
signaling to the h-catenin/Tcf pathway (14).
Several observations suggest that different Wnt molecules use a
different subtypes of Frz receptor. For example, Wnt7a relays signal
via Frz5 (15) and Frz9 (8). On the other hand, Wnt signaling via
Frz7 is reported to have oncogenic potential (16). Frz7 ectodomain
(an antagonist form) expression inhibits tumor growth in a colon
cancer cell line (17), and Frz7 is overexpressed in tumor cell lines
(18) and tumor tissues (19). Therefore, we hypothesized that
selective targeting of Frz7 will suppress oncogenic Wnt signaling
without interfering with tumor-suppressive Wnt7a signaling. Frz7
interacts directly with a PDZ protein interaction domain of the
Dishevelled (DVL) family (20). DVL3 is overexpressed in a wide
spectrum of cancer cells (21). Wnt signaling in the h-catenin
pathways seems to be induced by DVL overexpression (22, 23).
Therefore, disrupting the Frz7-DVL protein-protein interaction (24)
represents a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Previously, we
have shown that dominant-negative DVL lacking the PDZ domain
decreased cytosolic h-catenin levels, diminished Tcf-mediated
transcription, and suppressed tumorigenesis of mesothelioma cells
in vitro and in vivo (22). This study suggests that the PDZ domain
of DVL represents an attractive cancer therapeutic target.
The PDZ domain is a common protein-protein interaction
module that recognizes short peptide motifs on the COOH
termini or internal sequences that structurally mimic a sharp hturn structure of the cognate ligand (25). PDZ domains mediate
crucial protein-protein interactions that enforce localization and
organization of proteins in a variety of submembranous
complexes associated with cell signal mediators, including ion
channels, transmembrane receptors, and regulatory enzymes (26).
The therapeutic usefulness of PDZ protein-protein interaction

Abstract
Recent progress in the development of inhibitors of proteinprotein interactions has opened the door for developing drugs
that act by novel and selective mechanisms. Building on
that work, we designed a small-molecule inhibitor of the Wnt
signaling pathway, which is aberrantly activated across a wide
range of human tumors. The compound, named FJ9, disrupts
the interaction between the Frizzed-7 Wnt receptor and the
PDZ domain of Dishevelled, down-regulating canonical Wnt
signaling and suppressing tumor cell growth. The antitumorigenic effects of FJ9 were pronounced, including induction
of apoptosis in human cancer cell lines and tumor growth
inhibition in a mouse xenograft model. FJ9 is thus among the
first non-peptide inhibitors to show therapeutic efficacy
through disruption of PDZ protein-protein interactions.

Introduction
Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is implicated
in the development of a broad spectrum of tumors (1–3). Upregulation of Wnt-associated genes has been shown to play a role
in the development of human cancers. For example, Wnt16 is
overexpressed in the pre-B subtype of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, which is characterized by a t(1;19) chromosomal
translocation that results in the E2A-PBX1 fusion protein. Wnt16,
a target gene of E2A-PBX1, plays key a role in leukemogenesis in
such cases (4, 5). However, although many Wnt genes (Wnt1,
Wnt3a, and Wnt16) are thought to have oncogenic potential, others
(Wnt5a and Wnt7a) have the characteristics of tumor suppressor
genes (2). For example, most lung cancer cell lines and tissues show
loss of Wnt7a, and the restoration of Wnt7a expression upregulates E-cadherin and inhibits proliferation of non–small cell
lung cancer cells in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
g–dependent manner (6–8). Loss of expression of h-catenin and
E-cadherin is considered a marker of poor prognosis for lung

Hemagglutinin (HA)–negative mDVL1-pCS2+ and DPDZ-DVL1 were described previously (22).
Protein expression. The coding region of the PDZ domain of the human
DVL3 was amplified by a standard PCR protocol using 5¶-CCTTAAGGATCCCTCAACATCATCACGGTCAC-3¶ as a forward primer, 5¶-CCTTAACTCGAGTCTATGGGTCCCAGCACTTGGCTA-3¶ as a reverse primer and the
human DVL3 full-length cDNA as a template. The PCR product was purified
by agarose-gel electrophoresis, digested by BamHI and XhoI, and inserted
into pGEX-6P2 vector (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) by T4 DNA ligase
to prepare human DVL3 (hDVL3) PDZ-pGEX-6P2. The DVL PDZ-pGEX-6P2
vector was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells, and clones were selected by
a standard protocol. The positive clones were identified by sequencing of
the maintained plasmids (UCSF sequencing facility). The cells were treated
by isopropyl-L-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside for inducing the glutathione
S-transferase (GST) fusion protein expression, grown in Luria-Bertani
culture media at 20jC overnight, and lysed by sonication. The GST-hDVL3
PDZ domain protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham)
from the crude lysate, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by a standard
BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). GST-hDVL1 PDZ domain protein was
prepared in a similar manner.
Compound preparation. FJ9 was synthesized as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 and stored as a 30 to 50 mmol/L aqueous solution (containing
no DMSO) of the monosodium salt.
AlphaScreen energy transfer assay. Serial dilutions of FJ9 (0.1–1,000
Amol/L) were made in the AlphaScreen GST-binding buffer supplemented
with biotin-GKLQSWRRF peptide (10 Amol/L) and the GST-DVL1 or GSTDVL3 PDZ domain (100 nmol/L). The biotin-GKLQSWRRF peptide was not
added in a concurrent control experiment. Each sample solution was plated
in a 384-well plate in triplicate. To each well, 5 AL of anti-GST acceptor
beads (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA) was added. After incubation at room
temperature for 30 min in the dark, 5 AL of streptavidin donor beads
(Perkin-Elmer) was added. After further incubation at room temperature for
60 min in the dark, signal was read with an EnVision (Perkin-Elmer) plate
reader by the standard AlphaScreen method. Each result is reported as the
mean and SD. Binding curves were fitted, and the K i values were calculated
by using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).
Coimmunoprecipitation. HEK293T cells were transfected in six-well
plates with 4 Ag of HA-mDVL1-pCS2+ and myc-hFrz7-pcDNA3 by using
FuGENE6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation for 20 h. The medium was replaced with fresh medium
containing 0, 100, or 300 Amol/L FJ9, and the cells were incubated for an
additional 24 h. The cells were washed once with PBS and lysed by using a
Mem-PER kit (Pierce). The lysates were diluted with M-PER buffer (Pierce)
and immunoprecipitated by using an anti-HA immunoprecipitation kit
(3 AL of anti-HA agarose; Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The precipitates and whole lysate samples (transfection control) were
analyzed by Western blot.

H/15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic
resonance. Chemical shift measurements were done with a Varian INOVA
600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer at 25jC. 15Nlabeled mDVL1 PDZ domain (0.3 mmol/L) was buffered in 100 mmol/L
potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10% D2O, 0.5 mmol/L EDTA, and 1 mmol/L
DTT. A 50 mmol/L solution of FJ9 monosodium salt in water (pH 7.5) was
added directly to the PDZ domain solution. A series of titration were carried
out. The protein/ligand ratio was 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, and 1:10.
Tcf reporter assay. Cells were plated in six-well plates and transfected
with the TOPflash or FOPflash reporter plasmid (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) as
described (22). After incubation for 24 h, FJ9 was added. Each reporter gene
transcript was normalized to the luciferase activity of the pRL-TK reporter
(cotransfected internal control). The Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay kit (Promega)
was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All experiments were
done independently in triplicate. The results reported are the means and SDs
normalized to the TOPflash/pRL-TK reporter activity in the absence of FJ9.
Western blot. The cells (six-well plate) were treated with the FJ9 for
24 to 48 h, washed by PBS, and lysed with M-PER mammalian cell lysis
buffer (Pierce) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail SetII (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA).

antagonism has been clearly shown by using a peptide antagonist
(ref. 27; reviewed in ref. 28). Regardless, few efforts have been
made to design specific non-peptide antagonists of PDZ domain
interaction. Our aim in this study was to design a proof-ofprinciple small-molecule inhibitor to block the interaction
between the PDZ domain of DVL and the COOH-terminal region
of Frz receptor and to test whether it inhibits down-stream Wnt
signaling and suppresses cancer cell growth. We reported the
structure-based design of an indole-3-carbinol compound that
mimics the tetrapeptide sequence binding to a PDZ domain (29).
This compound formed a covalent adduct by electrophilic
alkylation of a histidine residue in the PDZ domain and therefore
had limited therapeutic potential because electrophilic inhibitors
often lack specificity in targeting biomolecules. To overcome this,
we designed a new non-electrophilic indole-2-carbinol–based
chemical scaffold. One compound from this series inhibits the
protein-protein interaction between the DVL PDZ domain and
Frz7. That inhibitor, named FJ9, markedly down-regulates
canonical Wnt signaling and suppresses tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human tumor cell lines (NCI-H1703, NCI-H460, NCI-A549,
NCI-H28, HCT116 p53 / , HeLa, LOX, and HEK293T) were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 (NCI-H1703, NCI-H460, NCI-A549, NCI-H28, HeLa,
LOX, and HCT116 p53 / ), Eagle MEM (HeLa), or DME H-21 high-glucose
(HEK293T) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin
(100 IU/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). Normal human small airway
epithelial cells (SAEC) and normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells
were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and cultured using the
Clonetics SAGM Bullet kit. LP9 was purchased from the Cell Culture Core at
Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Rheinwald Lab, Boston, MA) and
immortalized by introduction of hTERT as described (30). To obtain LP9
cell line expressing wild-type DVL, the XhoI/EcoRI mouse DVL1 (mDVL1)
fragment of the pCS-mDVL1 was cloned into the XhoI/EcoRI site of pLXN.
In the same manner, pLXN-mDPDZ-DVL1 was constructed from pCSmDPDZ-DVL1. To prepare retroviral stocks, Phoenix A cells were transfected with pLXN-neo-DVL1, DPDZ-DVL1, or pLXN-neo (empty vector)
using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. Retroviral constructs were introduced
into LP9-TERT and selected after culture in neomycin (50 Ag/mL, 7 days).
The LP9 cells were cultured in M199 medium containing 15% calf serum
(Hyclone, Logan, UT) plus 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor and 0.4 Ag/mL
hydrocortisone. All cells were maintained at 37jC in a humid incubator
with 5% CO2.
Antibodies. Anti-h-catenin antibody was purchased from Transduction
Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti–cyclin D1, anti-c-myc, and anti-survivin
antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-hactin, anti–phospho-473 Akt, and anti–phospho-c-jun (Ser63) antibody were
from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti–phospho-c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase (anti–phospho-JNK; Thr183/Tyr185) antibody was from
Promega, Inc. (Madison, WI).
Plasmids. myc-Human Frz7-pcDNA3. The total mRNA sample of SW480
colon cancer cells was reverse transcribed by using SuperScript II RnaseHReverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The coding region of the human Frz7 (hFrz7) in
the obtained cDNA sample was amplified by a standard PCR protocol using
5¶-TATAGCTAGCCACCATGGAACAAAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTGATGCGGGACCCCGGCGCGGCC-3¶ as a forward primer and 5¶-TATAAAGCTTTTATCATACCGCAGTCTCCCCCTTGCT-3¶ as a reverse primer. The
PCR product was purified by agarose-gel electrophoresis, digested by NheII
and HindIII, and inserted into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) by T4 DNA Quick
ligation kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The positive clone was
identified by sequencing of the isolated plasmids from the transformed DH5
a cells [University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) sequencing facility].

Antagonist of Dishevelled Suppressing Tumor Cell Growth
To normalize the PAGE loading, the protein concentration of each crude
lysate was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The normalized amounts of the lysate samples were loaded
on SDS-PAGE (10% or 12% ReadyGel; Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and
transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes.
For detecting alterations of h-catenin, cytosolic extracts were prepared and
examined as described previously (31). h-Actin served as loading control.
DVL small interfering RNA transfection was carried out as described
previously (23). HCT116 cells were plated 24 h before treatment in sixwell plates at a density of 1.5  106 per well in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FCS without antibiotics. Cells were transfected with siRNAs
(100 nmol/L) using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and incubated for 72 to
96 h. Transfected cells were collected to extract protein for RNA isolation
for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis.
Taqman RT-PCR was carried out as shown in the Supplementary
Information.
Analysis of apoptosis. Cells in six-well plates were treated with FJ9 in the
culture medium for 3 to 6 days, treated with trypsin, stained with Annexin
V-FITC (Apoptosis Detection kit; Oncogene, Uniondale, NY) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol, and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry
(FACScan; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lake, NJ) as described previously (32).
Cytometry was recorded in two dimensions: the x-axis represented Annexin
V-FITC staining, and the y-axis represented propidium iodide staining.
Percent apoptosis was calculated as the percentage of FITC-positive cells
(sum of top right and bottom right areas of the graph).
In vivo tumor suppression study. Groups of eight 6-week-old female
nude mice (strain: NSWNU-M; Taconic, Germantown, NY) were injected s.c.
in the dorsal area with four million H460 tumor cells in 100 AL PBS. After
7 days, during which the tumors developed essentially uniformly, the animals
began receiving daily i.p. injections of FJ9 (50 mg/kg in 80 AL PBS) or of 80 AL
PBS (days 8–21 after cell injection). Tumor size and body weight were
measured on days 12, 14, and 16 after the start of FJ9 treatment. Mice that
did not form tumors or that died of causes unrelated to tumor or therapy
were eliminated from the analysis. Tumor volume was calculated as x 2y / 2,
where x = width, y = length, and x < y, and was reported as the mean and SD
values obtained from five FJ9-treated mice and four PBS-treated mice.
Statistical analysis. A one-tailed Student’s t test was used to compare
the effect of treatment with that of no treatment (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4B).

Frz7 peptide and GST-fused human DVL PDZ domain was
titrated with FJ9. As the concentration of FJ9 increased, the signal
level dropped to that of the negative control, signifying
competitive antagonism (Fig. 1A). The K i value observed in this
competitive assay was equivalent to the binding affinity of Frz7
(20) and Idax (34) peptides to the mDVL1. We confirmed that
pretreatment with FJ9 for 30 min does not reduce the maximum
signal intensity generated by the PDZ domain bound to Frz7
peptide. In addition, whereas the MAGI3 PDZ2 domain treated
with the indole-3-carbinol compound shows a clear shift in mass
spectrometry (29), the DVL3 PDZ domain exposed to FJ9 under
identical conditions does not (data not shown). These data
strongly suggest that FJ9 does not covalently bind to the DVL
PDZ, at least within the period of observation. Although FJ9 was
derived from a compound that binds to the MAGI3 PDZ2
domain, it inhibited DVL3 PDZ domain interactions >10 times as
potently as MAGI3 PDZ2 interactions (Supplementary Fig. S2). To
determine whether FJ9 would inhibit Frz7-DVL interaction in
intact cells, we did a cellular coimmunoprecipitation analysis.
HA-tagged mDVL1 and myc-tagged hFrz7 were transiently
expressed in HEK293T cells. After cells were treated with FJ9,
the DVL1-Frz7 complex was precipitated from the lysate with
anti-HA agarose and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antimyc antibody. FJ9 treatment diminished formation of the DVL1Frz7 complex at concentrations above the in vitro K i (Fig. 1B).
Therefore, FJ9 penetrates the cell membrane and disrupts
intracellular DVL1-Frz7 binding.
To compare the binding of FJ9 and the binding of native ligands
to the DVL PDZ domain, we used the 1H/15N heteronuclear singlequantum coherence NMR method previously used to observe the
binding of the mDVL1 PDZ domain to peptide ligands (20, 24, 34).
Addition of FJ9 clearly shifted several peaks of the PDZ domain
spectrum. The data in titration experiment shows that the PDZ
domain and FJ9 are in fast exchange because peaks are shifted
gradually with increasing concentrations of FJ9 (Fig. 2). The
residues whose resonance peaks were shifted are located in the
regions of the aB helix and the hB sheet that form the ligandbinding groove of the PDZ domain and are the residues perturbed
by binding of the Frz7 peptide (20). However, unlike the Frz7
peptide, FJ9 caused no shifts in the region of the aA helix located

Results
We conducted AlphaScreen energy transfer assays (33) that
showed FJ9 to be a biochemical antagonist of the binding of Frz7
to DVL. The signal generated by the interaction of biotinylated

Peaks corresponding to residue Ser15, I16, N19, V70,
Arg72, E73, and Val75 shifted when FJ9 was added to the
protein. Shifted residues are shown on the ribbon
representation of mDVL1 PDZ domain.

Consistently, Western blot analysis revealed that FJ9 significantly
down-regulates these canonical Wnt signaling molecules (Fig. 3C
and E). Down-regulation of the signaling was confirmed at the
mRNA level. FJ9 suppressed survivin and cyclin D1 mRNA in this
cell with a dose dependency similar to that observed at the
protein level (Fig. 3D and F). Suppression of Wnt signaling by
silencing the DVL gene (23) also down-regulated the survivin gene
(Fig. 3F). Taken together, these results suggest that FJ9 inhibits
the Tcf transcriptional activity by directly suppressing DVLmediated nuclear translocation of h-catenin.
DVL is a weak activator of Akt (41), and FJ9 slightly reduced
the level of activated Akt as well (Fig. 3C). The DVL PDZ domain
is not essential for activation of the JNK, a key mediator of noncanonical Wnt signaling (42). FJ9 had no effect on JNK activity in
HeLa cells transfected with mDVL1 (Fig. 3G). Because JNK
activation exerts a proapoptotic stimulus (43), we hypothesized
that FJ9 would fail to induce apoptosis in the absence of hcatenin signaling. To test this hypothesis, we observed the effect
of FJ9 on H28 mesothelioma cells expressing high levels of Wnt1
but containing a homozygous deletion of the b-catenin gene
(13, 44). FJ9 neither suppressed growth nor induced apoptosis
(Fig. 4A). This result differs strikingly from the JNK-dependent
apoptosis of H28 cells observed when Wnt-Frz interaction is
inhibited by Wnt1 siRNA (13), Dickkopf-1 (45), or sFRP4 (46).
These results suggest that the cellular effect of FJ9 is independent
of the JNK-mediated pathway. This finding is also consistent with
the weak binding affinity of FJ9 for MAGI3 (Supplementary
Fig. S2), which regulates JNK activation through binding with
Frz4 (47). To further investigate if FJ9 perturb other signaling
than the Wnt pathway, we observed the effect of FJ9 on total
gene expression. HCT116 cells were treated with FJ9 under a
concentration in which their Tcf activity is only modestly
diminished (100 Amol/L), and their RNA was analyzed by using
Affymetrix GeneChips. Only 0.8% of probe sets were either
up-regulated or down-regulated >2-fold (Supplementary Fig. S3).

outside of the groove probably because of the relative compactness
of FJ9. FJ9 caused smaller shifts than did Frz7 peptide, suggesting
that FJ9 causes less conformational perturbation in the PDZ
domain backbone.
To investigate whether FJ9 inhibits the Wnt signaling cascade,
we assayed Wnt signaling in cells that had been treated with FJ9.
DVL mediates at least two (i.e., canonical and non-canonical) Wnt
signaling cascades (35). The canonical pathway is triggered by
nuclear translocation of h-catenin followed by activation of Tcf
transcription. To confirm if FJ9 inhibits the nuclear translocation
of h-catenin DVL dependently, we used the well-characterized
normal human mesothelial cell line LP9. LP9 has a stable growth
control system, has no apparent tumorigenic potential (36), and
shows only trace Wnt signaling (32), suggesting that the pathway
is essentially dormant. We created LP9 cell lines stably expressing
empty vector (mDVL1) or mDVL1 lacking the PDZ domain
(DPDZ-DVL1; ref. 22). We hypothesized that if FJ9 acts by a DVLspecific mechanism, it would down-regulate cytosolic h-catenin
only in the DVL1 cell line. After treatment with FJ9, we observed
no significant cell death or morphologic change in any of the cell
lines. However, cytosolic h-catenin was significantly downregulated in a dose-dependent manner only in the DVL1 cells
(Fig. 3A). These results suggest that FJ9 down-regulates the
nuclear translocation of h-catenin by interacting directly with
the DVL PDZ. Therefore, we expected that FJ9 down-regulates
Tcf transcription regardless of h-catenin mutation. To confirm
this hypothesis, we analyzed Tcf transcription activity in HCT116
cells in which Tcf signaling is constitutively activated because
of mutated gene encoding non-degradative h-catenin (37). At
concentrations above the antagonism K i (Fig. 1A), FJ9 inhibited
Tcf promoter activity dose-dependently, as measured by a TCF
optimal promoter (TOPflash) reporter assay (37), but had less
effect on the negative mutant control reporter FOPflash (Fig. 3B).
The Tcf transcription up-regulates several gene products involved
in mitosis, including c-myc (38), cyclin D1 (39), and survivin (40).

Discussion

Taken together, these results suggest that effect of FJ9 is specific
to DVL PDZ domain but not perturbing diverse cell signaling
promiscuously.
We next investigated the effect of FJ9 on the growth of tumor
cells with intact h-catenin signaling. In the LOX melanoma cell line
and the H460 and H1703 non–small cell lung cancer cell lines, FJ9
caused significant apoptosis at the same concentrations at which it
suppressed Tcf promoter activity (Fig. 4A). In contrast, FJ9 had
little discernible effect on primary cultures of NHBE cells or SAEC,
neither of which expresses Wnt-1. These results show that the
absence of Wnt-1 in normal tissues (32) accounts for the tumorspecific effect of FJ9. To assess the therapeutic potential of FJ9
in vivo, we measured inhibition of tumor growth by FJ9 in a mouse
xenograft model. H460 cells were transplanted into nude mice to
induce tumors. Daily administration of FJ9 began after 7 days and
continued for 14 days. FJ9 significantly inhibited the growth of the
tumor xenografts (Fig. 4B). The mice showed no significant weight
loss (<5%; data not shown).

This study was based on the hypothesis that activation of the
upstream Wnt pathway is an important contributor to diverse
human cancers. Overexpression of Frz7 and DVL3 has been
suggested to play a causative role in human carcinogenesis.
Consistent with this observation, we have shown that an inhibitor
of Frz7-DVL3 interaction selectively down-regulates canonical Wnt
signaling via suppression of h-catenin nuclear translocation.
Cancer stem cell signalings, such as Wnt and Hedgehog pathways,
are connected by protein-protein interaction network rather than
enzymatic signaling events. Therefore, small-molecule drugs that
antagonize protein-protein interactions in those signaling pathways show promise as the next generation of antitumor agents.
There has been more enthusiasm for traditional enzyme inhibitors
(e.g., kinase inhibitors and protease inhibitors) than for proteinprotein interaction antagonists for tumor therapies. However,
several recent studies clearly show the therapeutic usefulness of
protein-protein interaction antagonists, such as antagonists of

findings that both DVL siRNA and dominant-negative DPDZ-DVL
decreased cytosolic h-catenin levels and diminished Tcf-mediated
transcription in human mesothelioma cells. Survivin is downregulated by either FJ9 or DVL siRNA treatment (Fig. 3E and F).
Because inhibition of survivin expression is sufficient to cause
apoptosis and synergize with chemotherapy in human cancer cells
(50), FJ9 may have a synergistic effect on these cancer cells when
combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
In summary, our study indicates that small-molecule antagonists
of PDZ domain interaction of DVL can down-regulate the hcatenin–dependent Wnt signaling pathway and induce apoptosis
in human lung cancer and melanoma cells. These findings support
the further development of this potential strategy for the treatment
of cancer. Additional studies to find more efficient compounds for
clinical usefulness are now under way.

MDM2 (48) and Smoothened (49). In this study, we have shown
that a new small-molecule antagonist of DVL suppresses tumor
growth.
One concern associated with small-molecule drugs is specificity.
We have shown that FJ9 causes little effect on global gene
expression (Supplementary Fig. S3). The cellular effect of FJ9 is
well correlated with its PDZ domain antagonism activity. For
example, the effects of FJ9 on cell signaling are subtle at 30 Amol/L
but significant at 100 Amol/L (Fig. 3), consistent with its antagonism K i (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, our data suggest that FJ9 may
have little effect on the non-canonical Wnt pathway, as the
phosphorylated JNK level remained unchanged after FJ9 treatment (Fig. 3G), although we can not completely rule out the
possibility of involvement of the non-canonical pathway. The
specificity of FJ9 is further supported by the fact that FJ9 had
minimal effect on a mesothelioma cell line with homozygous
deletion of the b-catenin gene and on normal cells even at 100
Amol/L (Fig. 4A). Taken together, the evidence suggests that the
cellular effects of FJ9 are based on DVL PDZ domain antagonism
but not on promiscuous pharmacologic effects. The specificity of
FJ9 to DVL PDZ is also supported by our finding that FJ9
decreased the level of cytosolic h-catenin only in LP9 cells stably
transfected with DVL, not in control and DPDZ-DVL LP9 cell
lines (Fig. 3A).
Previously, we proved the hypothesis that DVL overexpression is
critical to Wnt signaling activation in lung cancer and prevalent as
a result of activated upstream signaling (22, 23). The apoptotic
effect of FJ9 in lung cancer cells correlates with our previous
