Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive malignancy with very poor prognosis.
Genome-wide, high-throughput technologies have made major advances in understanding the
molecular basis of this disease, although important mechanisms are still unclear. Recent data have
revealed specific genetic mutations (for example, KRAS, IDH1 and IDH2), epigenetic silencing,
aberrant signaling pathway activation (for example, interleukin (IL)-6/signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), tyrosine kinase receptor-related pathways) and molecular
subclasses with unique alterations (for example, proliferation and inflammation subclasses). In
addition, some ICCs share common genomic traits with hepatocellular carcinoma. All this
information provides the basis to explore novel targeted therapies. Currently, surgery at early stage
is the only effective therapy. At more advanced stages, chemotherapy regimens are emerging (that
is, cisplatin plus gemcitabine), along with molecular targeted agents tested in several ongoing
clinical trials. Nonetheless, a first-line conclusive treatment remains an unmet need. Similarly,
there are no studies assessing tumor response related with genetic alterations. This review explores
the recent advancements in the knowledge of the molecular alterations underlying ICC and the
future prospects in terms of therapeutic strategies leading towards a more personalized treatment
of this neoplasm.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a relative rare hepatobiliary cancer that primarily arises from
the transformation of cholangiocytes of the epithelial bile ducts.1,2 It is a heterogeneous
malignancy that comprises two different pathological entities, intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which arises from the small bile ducts in the liver, and
extrahepatic CC (ECC), which involves large hilar bile ducts and the extrahepatic biliary
tree. In the past two decades, the incidence of ICC, as well as its mortality rate, has been
increasing worldwide, reflecting the poor survival associated with this neoplasia.3,4 By
contrast, the rate of ECC is stable or even decreasing. Both entities have distinct risk factors,
histological features and clinical outcomes along with different pattern of genetic mutations,
expression profiling and epigenetic changes indicating different biological tumor types.5–7
These clinical and biological differences make difficult the interpretation of data derived
from both clinical and experimental studies where both entities are included indistinctly. In
this review, we will focus specifically on ICC, trying to trace the line from the basic
knowledge of its pathogenesis to the rationale for putative targeted therapies.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Globally, ICC accounts for around 10% of all primary hepatic cancers, being the second
most common after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)4 with an annual age-standardized
incidence rate <1.5 cases per 100 000 population in western countries.8 Epidemiological
data has associated the development of ICC with cirrhosis, hepatolithiasis and hepatitis virus
infection.6,9,10 The highest incidence of ICC is found in Thailand and other areas in Eastern
Asia because of chronic inflammation of bile ducts after liver fluke infections.11,12
However, in developed countries, ICC often arises not only in cirrhotic livers because of
chronic hepatitis or metabolic syndrome6,13 but also in non-cirrhotic livers because of the
absence of a clear etiological risk factor. To date, there are no specific available markers for
ICC diagnosis. Distinguishing ICC from other entities, such as metastatic carcinoma from
gallbladder or pancreatic cancer and HCC, can be made by clinical history, radiological
explorations and pathology.7 Although a number of potential molecular biomarkers (for
example, mucin 4, metalloproteinases 7 and 9) have been proposed, none of them has
reached standard clinical application.14,15

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Only recently the 7th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International
Union Against Cancer (UICC) have provided for the first time a tumor node metastasis
staging system for ICC, mirroring the growing medical importance of this malignancy.16
According to this new staging system, previous T2 and T3 subgroups are now combined into
a simplified T2 group and the previous T4 group has been redefined as T3. Hence, the 7th
staging system includes: stage I—T1N0M0; stage II—T2N0M0; stage III—T3N0M0; stage
IVa—T4N0M0 or N1M0 (any T), and stage IVb M1 (any T, any N). This staging system
posits the presence of multiple tumors, vascular invasion and metastatic disease as powerful
predictors of adverse outcome,17 whereas the tumor size is not considered a significant
prognostic factor.18 Overall, the understanding of prognostic factors in ICC still remains
incomplete.

MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS
Our knowledge of the molecular alterations underlying the development of ICC is still far
from complete, but recent research efforts have improved the understanding of ICC
pathogenesis. Herein, we overview the molecular pathogenesis along with the latest findings
in terms of genetic and epigenetic alterations, chromosomal aberrations, microRNAs
(miRNAs) and molecular pathways disturbances (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Overview of molecular pathogenesis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Activation of Notch and Wnt signaling governs intrahepatic bile duct development and
proliferation and progenitor cell activation, but the direct implication of these cascades in
cholangiocarcino-genesis is not established.19 Although important mechanisms underlying
the pathogenesis of ICC are still unclear, recent genome-wide technologies have provided
novel insights into the molecular understanding of this disease. In the classical model of ICC
pathogenesis, promotion of tumor development follows chronic biliary inflammation (with
the release of inflammatory cytokines inducing inducible nitric oxide synthase in
cholangiocytes, favoring mutagenesis, impaired DNA repair and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
upregulation) and cholestasis (where bile acid signaling promotes cholangiocyte growth via
activation of growth factors).2,20,21 Once clonal proliferation led by epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), interleukin (IL)-6 and
MET is established, additional alterations regulated by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms in
cholangiocytes or stromal cells induce limitless replicative potential (telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) activation), evasion of apoptosis (mediated by COX-2, BCL-2),
neoangiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2), and
invasion and metastasis (matrix metalloproteinases overexpression and E-cadherin
downregulation).1,2,20–22

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ICC results from malignant transformation of cholangiocytes, and in a subset of cases it also
arises from progenitor cells. Recent data indicate common genomic traits between ICC and
HCC, supporting the hypothesis of common cell ancestors in specific molecular
subclasses.23 Transcriptome analysis suggests that the poor prognostic subclass of ICC share
genomic traits and signatures of poor-prognosis HCC,22,24 which are associated with stemlike molecular signatures.25–27 Current evidence suggests that 20–25% of HCCs derive from
stem cells, whereas the rest derive from adult hepatocytes.28 In a recent meta-analysis
exploring molecular subclasses of HCC in more than 600 patients,29 the S2 subclass was
characterized by stem cell phenotype (high EpCAM and AFP expression), AKT/mechanistic
target of rapamycin (mTOR) and MYC activation and poor prognosis. Moreover, both ICC
and HCC share common copy number variations, including chromosomal gains (1q, 8q and
17q) and losses (4q, 8p, 13q and 17p) together with high-level amplifications of 11q–
13.24,30 Finally, ICC shares dominant risk factors associated with HCC development, mostly
cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections, and metabolic syndrome due to
diabetes and/or overweight.6,13
Genetic mutations in ICC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several studies have evaluated the role of mutations in ICC as well as their potential impact
in prognosis and utility for diagnosis. Conclusive data in this regard is limited by the small
number of samples analyzed in most of the studies and the mixed nature of CC specimens.
Activating mutations of KRAS are frequent (22%, range 5–57%),22,24,31–35 particularly in
hotspots located at codon 12, and have been pointed as independent predictors of worse
survival rate after hepatectomy.31,36 These data, however, need further validation in
independent cohorts of samples. BRAF and EGFR mutations have been reported in 7% (1–
22%) and 2% (0–20%), respectively.22,24,37,38 On the other hand, NRAS or
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mutations seem to be rare events in ICC.39 The tumor
suppressor gene TP53 appears mutated in more than 50% of human malignancies. A large
number of TP53 loss-of-function mutations have been reported in ICC at different
prevalence (0.7–37%) with an overall frequency of 15%.24,32–34,40 The contribution of the
cell cycle regulator to the development of ICC has been proven in experimental animal
models.41,42 Lately, there has been a growing interest in assessing the role of mutations in
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2). Overall, mutations in these genes were
identified in 14% of 433 ICCs.43–45 Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 co-occurred with

increased protein levels of TP53 and were associated with DNA hypermethylation. The
functional relevance of IDH mutations in the biliary tract remains to be determined.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There is no reported study assessing whole-genome sequencing in ICC, and the sole data
available include eight cases of liver fluke-related CCs.46 In this study, 206 somatic
mutations affecting 187 genes were identified in known cancer genes (KRAS, TP53) and in
10 novel mutated genes involved in histone modification, genomic instability and G-protein
signaling (for example, MLL3, ROBO2, PEG3 and GNAS).
Chromosomal aberrations in ICC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There are only a few studies reporting chromosomal imbalances in ICC. Four of them
investigated copy number variations by applying comparative genomic hybridization to
small series of ICC patients from Eastern countries47–49 and Europe.50 Even though the
studies from the Eastern countries revealed common pattern of alterations, including gains at
8q, 17q and 20q and losses at 4q, 17p and 18q, the European study revealed only partial
overlap and a higher karyotypic complexity. The common alterations were restricted to
gains at 7p and 8q and losses at 1p, 4q and 9p. These discrepancies might reflect differences
in ethnicity as well as etiological backgrounds. Moreover, the small number of cases
analyzed in each study further limits the interpretation of data. Recently, Sia et al.24 first
applied a single-nucleotide polymorphism array to analyze copy number variation in more
than 149 formalin-fixed ICC tissues collected in Europe and the United States. The analysis
identified a variety of chromosomal alterations, including gains at 1q and 7p and several
losses for 3p, 4q, 6q, 9pq, 13q, 14q, 8p, 17p and 21q, some of them confirming results
previously reported. Notably, significant overlap was found between the two European
series, further suggesting that the different ethnicity could explain discrepancies observed
among eastern and western studies.
Epigenetic and miRNA changes in ICC
Human cancer exhibits aberrant epigenetic regulation through promoter hypermethylation51
along with miRNAs deregulation.52 The methylation profile of several tumor suppressor
genes has been investigated in ICC, including p16INK4a/CDKN2 (47%, range 11–83%),
RASSF1A (56%, range 47–64%) and APC (29%, range 21–46%).34,35,49,53–56 Other
relevant aberrantly methylated genes include SOCS-3, implicated in IL-6/ signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, which promoter is hypermethylated in
27% of CC tumors,57 p14ARF, which prevents TP53 degradation and hence cell cycle arrest
in 18% (range 9–76%) of tumors,35,53,56 and the transcription factor RUNX3 in 42% of ICC
tumors.58

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At the same time, recent evidence suggests that miRNAs’ expression pattern has an
important role in the development and progression of ICC. Studies evaluating the function
of single oncogenic miRNAs have been reported, such as mir-21459 and mir-21.60,61
Furthermore, a unique 38-miRNA profile has been identified in a cohort of 27 ICCs,62 and
some of them are associated with aberrant signaling pathways (for example, hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF)/MET, IL-6/STAT3, and so on). More recently, a link between
miR-200c, stem cell traits and poor prognosis has been proposed.27 Nevertheless, data
should be interpreted with caution, and the exact role of miRNAs either as oncoMIRs or as
prognostic markers remains to be elucidated.
The role of stroma in ICC
ICCs are desmoplastic cancers frequently surrounded by a dense stroma with marked
cellular admixture. Only recently the significance of this cancer microenvironment has been
elucidated and increasing evidence suggests its crucial role in cancer progression and in the

promotion of resistance to therapy. Interestingly, the genomic profiling of the epithelium
and the stroma from 23 microdissected CCs identified a total of 1442 differentially
expressed genes.22 Notably, IL-6 and TGFB3 were found upregulated in the stroma along
with chemokine receptors and ligands, cytokines receptors and interleukins. The stromal
signature was found associated with poor prognosis. Hence, it seems that targeting the ICCassociated stroma could represent a new valid therapeutic strategy. The ICC-associated
stroma is often enriched with mesenchymal cells, including activated macrophages and
cancer-associated fibroblasts. To date, many studies have suggested that tumor-associated
macrophages may contribute to tumor growth, development and prognosis in several
cancers.63 In ICC, recent evidence suggests that patients with higher levels of CD163positive macrophages show poor disease-free survival.64 On the other side, -smooth
muscle actin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts are able to induce cell proliferation,
migration, invasion and epithelial–mesenchymal transition in an organotypic model of ICC
in vitro.21,65
Biological differences between intra- and extrahepatic CC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CCs include a group of tumors largely heterogeneous and can be classified as ECC and ICC.
These two entities differ in terms of incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation and
molecular biology.4,7 ECC is the most common form of CC accounting for 80% of cases,
but its incidence has remained stable or even slightly declined during the past four decades.
Conversely, the incidence of ICC has increased worldwide.3,4,66,67 In terms of risk factors,
ECCs have been associated with chronic inflammation of the biliary tract including primary
sclerosing cholangitis in the western countries and hepatolithiasis in Asian countries,1,2,7
whereas ICC share risk factors with HCC, such as cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and C
infection, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and alcohol.6,68,69 Hepatic infections by liver
flukes are associated with higher incidence of both ICC and ECC in Asian countries.1,7,70
ICC arises from intrahepatic bile ducts and its typical morphological presentation is of an
incidental hepatic mass lesion with a well-demarcated nodule.1,7 These tumors can grow to a
large size as they remain asymptomatic for a long period of time.71–73 In contrast, ECC
arises from epithelia of large ducts and can be often detected at an early stage owing to signs
of biliary obstruction and cholangitis.2,7

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

More novel findings at molecular level have pointed to genetic differences between both
tumor types.5,56,74–76 A unique altered expression of 1633 and 80 genes has been identified
in ICC and ECC, respectively, when compared with normal biliary epithelium.75 Aberrant
methylation of RASSF1A is more common in ECC (83% vs 47% in ICC), whereas
methylation of GSTP occurred more frequently in ICC (31% vs 6% in ECC).56 In addition,
somatic mutations in the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2 have shown to be more
prevalent in ICC (22–28%) than in ECC (0–7%).43,44 Finally, BRAF mutations (7%) have
been only reported in ICCs (Table 1).5 Genome-wide high-throughput sequencing and
methylome analysis comparing both entities will refine the understanding of their
differentiated molecular traits.

SIGNALING PATHWAYS
The development of targeted therapies in cancer has been increasingly guided by the tumor’s
genetic profile. An example is the identification of oncogene addiction loops that has led to
the use of antibodies blocking ERBB2 (HER2/neu) in breast cancer and EGFR and ALK
inhibitors in lung cancer. As a consequence of the above-described genetic and epigenetic
alterations, several pathways have been found deregulated in ICC, including inflammatory
pathways, cell cycle and growth factors signaling. Although they contain potential drivers of
carcinogenesis, to date no oncogenic addition loop has been documented.

Sia et al.

Page 6

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Some pathways have been found to be deregulated, including the most common IL-6/STAT
signaling, growth factors (for example, EGF, HGF/MET, VEGF) and KRAS/MAPKs. Other
emerging pathways, including Hedgehog,77 WNT/catenin78,79 and Hippo,80 have been only
occasionally described in ICC. Below we review key pathways of importance in the disease
in terms of candidate targeted therapies.
IL-6/STAT signaling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inflammation has been closely linked to an increased risk of ICC. Overall, JAK/STAT
signaling activation accounts for 50% of ICC, and may affect more than 70% of the ICC
inflammation subclass.24 In particular, IL-6 is an important oncogenic player in the growth
of malignant cholangiocytes57,81 and its overexpression may be a consequence of the
epigenetic silencing of SOCS-3, the suppressor of cytokine signaling.57,82 IL-6 is secreted
by CC cells in response to inflammatory stimuli in an autocrine or paracrine manner and acts
upstream or downstream of potent oncogenes. Binding of IL-6 to the gp130 receptor triggers
receptor dimerization, leading to the activation of gp130-associated JAK kinases (JAK1,
JAK2 and TYK2) and subsequent activation of STAT3, which induces the transcription of
target genes essential for cell growth, differentiation and proliferation. The silencing of
SOCS-3 might explain, in part, the IL-6-mediated activation of STAT3. Treatment of CC
cells with demethylating agents restored SOCS-3 expression, downregulating MCL1 and
sensitizing CC cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)mediated apoptosis.57,82 Furthermore, IL-6 increases the telomerase activity facilitating
malignant cholangiocytes to evade senescence,83 and it is also involved in the altered
methylation pattern of relevant growth factor receptors, including EGFR,84–86 and in the
expression of miRNA belonging to the let-7 family.87
EGFR signaling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Members of the EGFR family, most notably EGFR and ERBB2 (HER-2/ neu), have been
implicated in the ICC pathogenesis. Overexpression of these receptors (10–32%) has been
reported in ICC patients,88–90 but mutations are infrequent (Table 1).37 On the other side,
the oncogenic role of ERBB2 has been shown in a tissue-specific transgenic model that
developed intrahepatic biliary tumors in 30% of cases.91 Aberrant phosphorylation of EGFR
family receptors activates MAPK/ERK and p38, which in turn increases COX-2 and induces
inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of tumor growth.92–93 Several preclinical studies with
anti-EGFR targeted drugs, such as erlotinib and cetuximab, have demonstrated in vitro a
decrease in cell proliferation of ICC cell lines,94 although in vivo tumor growth inhibition
requires blocking both ERBB1 and ERBB2 receptors by lapatinib.22,95 Recently, it has been
reported that vandetanib, an antagonist of EGFR, VEGFR2 and RET kinases, caused
significant ICC growth inhibition in vivo.96 However, the clinical experience with antiEGFR therapies showed questionable benefits, suggesting that further investigations will be
required to delineate the relevance of these targets (Table 2).
HGF/MET signaling
MET is considered a key regulator of invasive growth. The interaction of HGF with its
receptor MET triggers the activation of major signaling cascades, including MAPK, PI3K/
AKT and STAT.97 MET is overexpressed in ICC (12–58%).98,99 Several experimental
models have linked overexpression of MET with overexpression of members of the EGFR
family98,100 and have shown the capacity of HGF to stimulate migration and invasion in CC
cells.101 Nonetheless, MET inhibitors have not yet entered clinical trials.

Page 7

Angiogenesis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

VEGF has an important role in tumor-associated neoangiogenesis. Activation of the VEGF
receptors leads to survival, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells.102 VEGF has
been found expressed in 51% of 106 ICCs89 and its expression level correlates with poor
prognosis.103 Moreover, a recent study showed that sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor acting
predominantly against BRAF and VEGFR, presents potent antitumor activity in both in vitro
and in vivo preclinical models of human ICC.104 However, the role of VEGF in ICC needs
to be further explored.
Emerging pathways in ICC: Wnt and Hedgehog signaling
The Wnt/ -catenin pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway essential for normal
cellular processes (that is, development, growth and survival) and its dysregulation has been
found associated with numerous malignancies. So far, few studies in ICC reported aberrant
nuclear localization (15%) and reduced membranous expression of -catenin.78,79,105
However, the mechanism beyond Wnt activation in ICC has not been elucidated. In fact,
genetic mutations in -catenin, Axin 1 and APC are rare events.78,79 Hedgehog pathway has
an important role in survival, proliferation, development and self-renewal. The role of this
pathway in ICC pathogenesis has not been explored thoroughly, and just some preclinical
studies demonstrated an indirect role of this cascade in promoting tumorigenesis.77,106

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Animal models of ICC
Only a few animal models have been able to recapitulate key molecular and clinical features
of human ICC progression.107 Among them, a unique ‘patient-like’ rat model of ICC that
closely mimics the disease has been proposed. It consists of an orthotopic model based on
the inoculation in the bile duct of isogenic rats of the highly tumorigenic BDEneu rat
epithelial cell line,108 which results in rapid ICC tumor growth, accompanied by bile duct
obstruction and peritoneal metastases. Another model consists of mutant mice harboring
albumin-Cre-mediated somatic activation of KRASG12D and deletion of TP53 in the hepatic
parenchyma.42 This is based on the observation that tissue-specific activation of KRASG12D
alone results in the development of invasive ICC with long latency that is strongly
accelerated by combining with heterozygous or homozygous deletion of TP53 (mean
survival of 56 vs 19 weeks, respectively). Clearly, these models might represent a valuable
platform for the understanding of the progression of ICC and for the preclinical testing of
promising novel therapies.
Molecular classification of ICC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Molecular classification of cancer should aid in understanding the biological subclasses and
drivers of the disease and optimize benefits from molecular therapies and enrich trial
populations. Molecular stratification can be based on biomarkers as predictors of response to
targeted drugs or biomarkers as prognostic factors. Few molecular subclasses have been
adopted by guidelines of management, and they are particularly based on biomarker
predictors of treatment response. This is the case of amplification of ERBB2 and responders
to trastuzumab in breast cancer,109 EGFR mutational status or ALK status and response to
erlotinib and crizotinib, respectively, in non-small-cell lung cancer,110,111 and BRAF
mutations to identify responders to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma.112 No such case has been
described in ICC.
Recent advancements have been made defining molecular subclasses in ICC based on
whole-transcriptome analysis and other biological parameters.22,24,113,114 The first
comprehensive study included 104 CC cases—both ICC and ECC—and described two
molecular subclasses, one of which with poor prognosis and activation of receptor tyrosine

kinases, including EGFR, ERBB2 and MET.22 Exploring the microenvironment of ICC in
23 cases, they identified two subclasses, including one with a stromal signature, including
chemokines (CXCR4), cytokines and IL-6, pointing to an alternative therapeutic strategy.
More recently, an integrative genomic study of 149 ICC identified two molecular subgroups
— inflammation and proliferation—with distinct genomic profiling and clinical outcome.24
The inflammation subclass (40%) showed an enrichment of inflammation and cytokine
pathway signatures, overexpression of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17, and constitutive activation of
STAT3. The Proliferation subclass (60%) was characterized by enrichment of activated
oncogenic pathways as RAS/MAPK and MET, high-level DNA amplifications at 11q13 and
deletions at 14q22.1 and signatures of poor outcome. Further independent validation of ICC
subclasses is needed in order to be adopted as stratification factors by ICC guidelines.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT
Overview and unmet needs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Surgical treatment is the only curative treatment option for ICC. Life expectancy for patients
with unresectable ICC is <5% at 5 years,4 whereas it increases to 20–44% at 5 years for
patients undergoing resection at early T1–T2 stages. Tumor recurrence is observed
frequently.115,116 Adjuvant treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and
photodynamic therapy, have not shown to significantly improve survival or time to
recurrence, albeit no large randomized trials have been published.2,7 The development of
molecular targeted therapies for the treatment of advanced ICCs has encountered many
problems.117 Firstly, the vast majority of clinical trials conducted until now are directed
towards biliary tract cancers, including both ICC and ECC, as well as gallbladder
carcinomas. Secondly, most studies are small, non-randomized and single-centered trials,
resulting in statistically underpowered or biased data. Finally, the development of targeted
agents in cancer is increasingly guided by the tumor’s genetic profile and until recently little
effort had been dedicated to fully understand the molecular basis of ICC. Despite that, in
recent years there has been a renewed interest in developing molecularly targeted therapies
in this arena (Table 2), especially in combination with conventional chemotherapy. The
completion of the landmark phase III trial (ABC-02 trial), which demonstrated improved
overall survival of patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin vs gemcitabine alone
(11.7 vs 8 months) defined a novel paradigm for the management of biliary tract cancers.118
The subgroup analysis including around 80 ICC confirms a positive signal of efficacy for
the combination therapy, but this result needs to be confirmed within a specific wellpowered RCT-only targeting ICC patients. This type of evidence will certainly be required
to accept the combination chemotherapy as the standard of care for management of patients
in the setting of guidelines and to be the control arm in advanced ICC trials testing novel
compounds.
Molecular targeted therapies
In the past years, a growing number of clinical trials have been conducted using few classes
of targeted therapies as first-line treatment in advanced biliary tract cancers (Table 2 and
Figure 2). These trials were carried out as single agents (for example, sorafenib, erlotinib,
sunitinib, selumetinib), combined targeted agents or in combination with conventional
chemotherapy (for example, gemcitabine, cisplatin and oxaliplatin). So far, discouraging
results have been obtained in several phase II studies where these agents have been used as
monotherapy (Table 2), such is the case of sorafenib119,120 and lapatinib.121 Small singlearm phase II studies have reported acceptable results combining gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin
with bevacizumab (median survival of 12.7 months; objective responses of 40%)122 or
cetuximab (median survival of 15.2 months; objective responses of 63%).123 At the same
time, a multicenter, open-label randomized phase III of GEMOX in combination with

erlotinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor against EGFR) or placebo suggested a marginal benefit
of erlotinib in the subgroup analysis of CC.124 Few randomized phase II trials are currently
ongoing, but no phase III pivotal trial is active so far (Table 3).
A more comprehensive understanding of ICC pathogenesis may lead to uncover new
candidate therapeutic targets. For example, herein we emphasized the importance of MET
signaling, IL-6/JAK/ STAT3 pathway and COX-2 in ICC (Figure 2). Currently, there are
multiple MET inhibitors in clinical development for solid tumors but none for testing
patients with ICC.125 Also, the use of recently developed and clinically evaluated novel
JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitors126–130 along with some novel STAT3 inhibitors131 and
antibodies against IL-6 receptor may be considered an appealing therapeutic strategy.
Finally, considering that selective targeting of COX-2 with celecoxib reduces CC
proliferation in vitro,93,132–134 COX-2-mediated pathway may represent a promising target.

CONCLUSIONS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There is still a limited understanding of the molecular abnormalities involved in ICC
pathogenesis. Only recently, there has been a growing effort dedicated to clarifying the
involvement of several signaling pathways and key drivers. However, an approach aimed at
identifying oncogenic loops and at linking these discoveries with the design of therapeutic
algorithms is still missing. In this regard, the identification of two molecular subclasses with
specific molecular traits needs further validation to guide a more stratified treatment
approach. As more we understand the molecular basis of CC, novel candidate targets, such
as MET, EGFR and JAK/STAT, may become attractive, and clinical trials testing drugs
blocking these pathways are encouraged. So far, advanced ICC is considered an orphan
cancer with no established first-line treatment option, hence representing an unmet medical
need. Although combined chemotherapy might provide survival advantages, results need to
be confirmed in specific trails for this tumor type. Hopefully, the latest technological
advancements (for example, next-generation sequencing technology) will significantly
improve our understanding of the main drivers of this neoplasm. These advancements

Summary of key molecular alterations involved in ICC carcinogenesis. Despite the absence
of clear etiological risk factors or underlying disease, external stimuli (for example, liver
fluke or hepatitis viral infection) favor the induction of proinflammatory signals mediated by
several cellular types lying in the microenvironment. The release of growth-promoting
factors and cytokines during chronic inflammation (for example, IL-6, tumor growth factor
) promotes cholangiocytes’ proliferation. This phenomenon along with the accumulation of
genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes and oncosuppressors leads to the malignant
transformation of normal cholangiocytes and to the deregulation of main signaling pathways
(for example, EGFR, ERBB2, HGF/MET, VEGFR) involved in the hallmarks of cancer,
such as proliferation, survival, invasion and enhanced angiogenesis.

Signaling pathways and molecular therapies in ICC. Major deregulated oncogenic signaling
pathways identified for ICC and targeted molecular drugs evaluated in preclinical and
clinical studies are represented. Activation of tyrosine kinase receptors (for example, EGFR,
VEGFR, MET, and so on) and also others, such prostaglandin receptor 4 (EP4), triggers the
activation of two major signaling pathways including the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT
pathways. These pathways implicate sequential activation of downstream tyrosine kinases,
which lead to the regulation of gene expression through the activation of specific
transcription factors. COX-2 is a key enzyme implicated in inflammation and cell growth
through the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In IL-6/STAT3 signaling, the binding

of IL-6 to the receptor leads to gp130 receptor dimerization and associated JAK
phosphorylation. These then provide a docking place for the transcription factor STAT3,
which also is phosphorylated and dimerized. Activated STAT3 is translocated to the nucleus
and induces the transcription of targeted genes implicated in cell processes, such as
proliferation, cell growth and differentiation.
