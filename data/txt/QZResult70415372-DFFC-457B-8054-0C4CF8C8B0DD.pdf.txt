ABSTRACT
Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds are a family of smallmolecules that inhibit nuclear export through covalent binding to cysteine 528 (Cys528)
in the cargo-binding pocket of Exportin 1 (XPO1/CRM1) and promote cancer cell death.
Selinexor is the lead SINE compound currently in phase I and II clinical trials for advanced
solid and hematological malignancies. In an effort to understand selinexor-XPO1
interaction and to establish whether cancer cell response is a function of drug-target
engagement, we developed a quantitative XPO1 occupancy assay. Biotinylated leptomycin
B (b-LMB) was utilized as a tool compound to measure SINE-free XPO1. Binding to XPO1
was quantitated from SINE compound treated adherent and suspension cells in vitro,
dosed ex vivo human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and PBMCs from
mice dosed orally with drug in vivo. Evaluation of a panel of selinexor sensitive and
resistant cell lines revealed that resistance was not attributed to XPO1 occupancy by
selinexor. Administration of a single dose of selinexor bound XPO1 for minimally 72
hours both in vitro and in vivo. While XPO1 inhibition directly correlates with selinexor
pharmacokinetics, the biological outcome of this inhibition depends on modulation of
pathways downstream of XPO1, which ultimately determines cancer cell responsiveness.

with the natural product inhibitor of XPO1, leptomycin
B (LMB), demonstrated high potency and cytoxicity
in vitro and in vivo [22], but this compound failed in the
clinic due to poor tolerability [23]. In an effort to target
this dysfunctional mechanism common to many cancer
types, Karyopharm Therapeutics has developed Selective
Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds which
bind to and inhibit XPO1 function [24]. SINE compounds
are slowly reversible small molecule inhibitors that
covalently bind to the cysteine 528 (Cys528) in the cargo
binding pocket of XPO1, block the binding of NES cargo
and hence prevent XPO1 from removing cargo from the
nucleus [18, 25]. SINE compounds have been shown to
effectively block nuclear export of many major TSPs and
GRPs including p53, p21, FOXO, IκB, and survivin, both
in vitro and in vivo [reviewed in [26]]. In cancer cells
nuclear retention of TSPs by SINE compounds results
in cell cycle arrest, inhibition of proliferation, initiation
of apoptosis [reviewed in [27]], and prevention of DNA
damage repair (Kashyap et al. 2014 EORTC poster,
manuscript in preparation). Normal cells, however, are
resistant to apoptotic effects of SINE compounds and

INTRODUCTION
A hallmark of all cancers regardless of their
mutational status or histopathology is the dysregulation
of the function of tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) and
growth regulatory proteins (GRPs) [1]. This malfunction
is often directly attributed to the over expression or
increased activity of exportin 1 (XPO1/CRM1) [2].
XPO1 serves as the nuclear export chaperone for over
200 different cargo proteins [3, 4]. The interaction
between XPO1 and the activated small G-protein Ran
(Ran-GTP) in the nucleus facilitates the binding to
cargo proteins containing a short amino acid sequence
of hydrophobic residues called a nuclear export signal
(NES). This binding leads to subsequent transport of the
multimeric complex through the nuclear pore, hydrolysis
of Ran-GTP, release of the cargo in the cytoplasm, and
return of XPO1 to the nucleus [5–8]. In cancer, over
expression of XPO1 protein results in an aberrant
distribution of TSPs to the cytoplasm where they are
rendered ineffective at surveying genomic damage and
preventing abnormal cell growth [9–21]. Experiments

typically undergo cell cycle arrest in the presence of
these compounds [25]. These findings have made SINE
compounds attractive therapies for a wide variety of solid
and hematological malignancies [see [27] for review], as
well as for the treatment of non-cancer indications with
enhanced nuclear export activity [28–30].
Selinexor (KPT-330), the first clinical SINE
compound, is currently being evaluated in Phase I and
II clinical trials in many different cancer indications
(see http://clinicaltrials.gov for details). To date, > 1000
patients have been dosed with selinexor and the drug has
shown good tolerability with manageable side effects.
Selinexor pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis in humans
has shown that the drug has a Tmax of ~4 hours and near
complete plasma clearance by ~24 hours post-dose. In an
effort to identify patients that would respond to selinexor
treatment, we developed an assay that evaluates drugtarget interaction from patient blood samples. In theory,
this assay could be used to correlate a patient’s response
to selinexor to the level of XPO1 engagement. In the
event that XPO1 from a particular patient was unable to
bind selinexor then this individual could be offered an

alternative therapy. Such an assay would be an ideal tool
to screen patients to provide them with precision medicine
and ensure they are receiving treatment that will be most
effective for their malignancy.

RESULTS
Biotinylated LMB has anti-cancer properties
that are similar to unmodified LMB
To determine whether a patient’s response to selinexor
therapy could be predicted from evaluating drug-target
interaction, we developed an assay to quantify XPO1
occupancy by SINE compounds. For this assay we utilized
biotinylated LMB (b-LMB) [31] as a tool compound to
quantify the amount of XPO1 bound by SINE compounds
(Figure 1). b-LMB was synthesized by coupling a biotin tag
to LMB. We compared the inhibition of nuclear export and
the cytotoxicity of b-LMB to that of the unmodified LMB.
We first evaluated the nuclear retention of the XPO1 cargo
protein Rev-GFP (HIV-Rev fused to the cAMP-dependent
Protein Kinase Inhibitor (PKI) nuclear export signal) stably

expressed in U2OS cells treated with selinexor, LMB or
b-LMB (Table 1). We then quantified the effects of these
compounds on cell death in several cancer cell lines using
an MTT cytotoxicity assay (Table 2). The ability of b-LMB
to induce nuclear retention of Rev-GFP in U2OS cells was
similar to unmodified LMB (IC50 0.11 nM vs. 0.16 nM,
respectively; Table 1) and was 360-fold more potent than
selinexor (IC50 40 nM; Table 1). Although b-LMB was less
cytotoxic than unmodified LMB (~6 – 30-fold), it proved to
be more potent than selinexor in all cell lines tested (Table 2).
These results indicated that b-LMB has anti-cancer activity
that is on par with unmodified LMB and is more potent
than selinexor, allowing for further development as a tool
compound for the XPO1 occupancy assay.

control. XPO1 was detected in the eluate from cells
treated with as little as 0.01 nM of b-LMB, while equal
levels of XPO1 and actin proteins were detected in all
input samples tested. The protein signals for XPO1
detected by Simple Western in Figure 2A were reported
as mean peak areas and were used to compare levels of
XPO1 present in each sample to produce a graphical
representation of the ratio of free XPO1 detected at each
concentration of b-LMB (Figure 2B). “Ratio of bound
XPO1” is defined as the ratio of the mean peak area of
b-LMB bound XPO1 detected in the eluate compared to
the mean peak area of all XPO1 detected in the input
lysate, while “free-fraction” refers to the amount of
XPO1 not occupied by SINE compound, as described
later. Increasing levels of bound XPO1 were detected
with increasing concentrations of b-LMB (Figure 2B).
The amount of b-LMB necessary to occupy 50% and
90% of XPO1 was calculated from the ratio of free XPO1
versus b-LMB concentration in MM.1S cells, which was
0.27 +/− 0.11 and 2.53 +/− 1.72 nM (n = 3), respectively.

XPO1 can bind b-LMB in a dose-dependent
manner
b-LMB was tested for the ability to bind XPO1
protein. First, a dose-response curve was generated by
exposing MM.1S cells to increasing concentrations of
b-LMB (0 – 500 nM) for 1.5 hours in culture. The cells
were then collected, lysed, and a portion of the lysate
(input) was reserved prior to incubating the remaining
lysate with streptavidin-tagged beads overnight. After
extensive washes, b-LMB bound XPO1 was eluted from
the beads, and XPO1 from both input and bead eluate
was detected and quantified by Simple Western on Peggy
Sue. Simple Western allows for the chemiluminescent
detection of proteins from small volumes of samples
that are run through a matrix-filled capillary. The signal
is detected by a CCD camera which generates a digital
image and then reports quantitative results. Figure 2A
is a representative digital western for XPO1 detected in
the eluate and input samples, with β-actin as a loading

Occupation of XPO1 by SINE compounds can be
quantitated
The next step was to evaluate whether selinexor
or other SINE compounds could dose-dependently bind
to XPO1. MM.1S cells were treated with increasing
concentrations (0 – 10 μM) of SINE compounds selinexor,
verdinexor (KPT-335), KPT-8602, or KPT-350 for one hour
prior to treatment with 1 nM b-LMB, the amount found
to reach a plateau in MM.1S cells (Figure 2B) as well as
the amount tested by Sakakibara et al [32]], for 1.5 hours.
The cells were then collected and processed for the XPO1
occupancy assay. Figure 3 shows a graphical representation of
an example of the ratios of free-fraction XPO1 (i.e. unbound

compound is shown which was calculated by dividing the mean peak areas of XPO1 occupied by b-LMB (from the eluate) by the total

by SINE) versus SINE compound concentration. For these
assays, the “ratio of free-fraction XPO1” is calculated by
dividing the mean peak areas of XPO1 occupied by b-LMB
(from the eluate) by the total amount of XPO1 (from the
input). The ratio of free-fraction XPO1 is indicative of the
amount of SINE compound bound to Cys528 of XPO1;
a lower ratio of free-fraction XPO1 means more XPO1 is
occupied by SINE compound and vice versa. All four SINE
compounds bound in a dose-dependent manner to XPO1
in the XPO1 occupancy assay. The average 50% and 90%
occupancy values were calculated for each SINE compound
and were compared to their Rev-GFP values (Table 3).
Verdinexor, KPT-8602, and selinexor were similarly effective
at occupying XPO1 while KPT-350 was less potent in the
XPO1 occupancy assay. This is consistent with the higher
Rev-GFP IC50 value for KPT-350, indicating that higher
KPT-350 concentration is needed to achieve entrapment of
REV-GFP relative to the other SINE compounds (Table 3).
As a negative control, the XPO1 occupancy assay was
also performed with KPT-301, the inactive, trans isomer
of KPT-185 [ [18, 25]; Figure 1], that does not have anticancer activity [15, 33, 34]. Treating MM.1S cells with
increasing concentrations (0 – 10 μM) of KPT-301 followed
by 1 nM b-LMB showed that no XPO1 bound to KPT-301,
demonstrating the specificity of the active SINE compounds
for XPO1 occupancy (data not shown). Together, these
results indicate that b-LMB can be effectively utilized as
an in vitro tool compound to evaluate the occupancy of all
XPO1 inhibitors.

treatment with 1 nM b-LMB. In freshly isolated PBMCs,
50% XPO1 occupancy occurred at 0.01 μM selinexor,
while 90% occupancy occurred at > 0.5 μM (Table 4),
similar to results obtained in MM.1S cells. Since patient
samples must be isolated and viably frozen at the clinic prior
to being tested, the assay was performed on PBMCs that
were revived after being viably frozen. For this, the other
half of the pooled healthy donor PBMCs were cryopreserved,
revived and assayed (Figure 4B). To allow sufficient time for
recovery from cryopreservation, revived PBMCs were treated
with increasing concentrations of selinexor (0 – 0.5 μM) for 4
hours, subsequently washed to remove the drug, then treated
with 1 nM b-LMB for 1 hour prior to the XPO1 occupancy
assay. In revived PBMCs, 50% XPO1 occupancy occurred at
the same concentration of selinexor as that of freshly isolated
PBMCs (Table 4). These ex vivo assays demonstrated that
PBMCs isolated from patients in the clinic and viably frozen
would be a suitable source of material to perform the XPO1
occupancy assay.
Based on these ex vivo results, we sought to determine
whether the XPO1 occupancy assay could be performed
on PBMCs exposed to selinexor in vivo (Figure 5).
Mice were orally administered vehicle, 0.75, 1.5, 3, or 10 mg/
kg of selinexor and 4 hours later the mice were terminally
bled. In order to have enough PBMCs to assay, the blood
from the mice for each dose (n = 4) was pooled and PBMCs
were immediately isolated. Mouse PBMCs were incubated
with 1 nM b-LMB for 1.5 hours ex vivo then collected and
prepared for the XPO1 occupancy assay. Increasing doses of
selinexor corresponded to increasing occupancy of XPO1, as
indicated by a decrease in the ratio of free-fraction XPO1
(Figure 5A). The amount of selinexor required to occupy
50% of XPO1 at 4 hours post-dosing was 1.84 mg/kg, while
the amount to achieve 90% occupancy was > 10 mg/kg.

PBMCs can be utilized as a sample source to
measure XPO1 occupancy by selinexor
Our goal was to use this method to quantify XPO1
occupancy in patient tumor biopsies. However, after numerous
attempts we found that this assay could only measure XPO1
occupancy in living cells with intact membranes. Therefore,
in addition to using this method on cultured monolayer cells
that can be trypsinized into suspension cells, we also used the
method on hematological suspension cells. Development of
this method in hematological cells derived from selinexor
patient peripheral blood or bone marrow biopsies required
additional optimization. We envisioned collection of biopsies
remotely in hospitals then shipment to a central laboratory
performing the assay. For this we optimized the assay for
measuring XPO1 occupancy in human PBMCs. Therefore
it would require conditions for preserving these cells
cryogenically at the clinic collecting the samples. In order
to evaluate this process, the XPO1 occupancy assay was
performed ex vivo on PBMCs isolated from pooled healthy
donor blood, where half of the PMBCs were assayed fresh
while the other half were cryopreserved (Figure 4). First,
the assay was performed on the freshly isolated PBMCs
(Figure 4A). Similar to the method described above,
PBMCs were incubated with increasing concentrations
of selinexor (0 – 0.5 μM) for 1 hour prior to a 1 hour
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Single dose administration of selinexor results in
sustained XPO1 occupancy
Using similar conditions, we sought to determine the
duration of XPO1 occupancy by SINE compounds in mice.
Once again mice were orally administered a single dose of
either placebo, 3, or 10 mg/kg of selinexor. The mice were
then terminally bled at 4, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours
post dose (n = 4 mice per dose per time point). Blood for each
dose at each time point was pooled and PMBCs were isolated.
Mouse PBMCs were incubated with 1 nM b-LMB for 1.5
hours ex vivo before being processed for the XPO1 occupancy
assay. Both 3 and 10 mg/kg had time-dependent increases in
the ratio of free-fraction XPO1, with 50% XPO1 occupancy
being sustained for up to 72 hours post-treatment (Figure 5B).
Interestingly, full saturation of XPO1 was already achieved
between 4–24 hours at the lower dose of 3 mg/kg. These
in vivo data demonstrate that it is possible to correlate the
level of occupied XPO1 to the amount of drug administered
and that the binding of selinexor to XPO1 is robust and
sustained for up to 72 hours after a single oral dose.

serial dilutions of selinexor (starting from 10 μM) for 4
hours, the time at which maximum Rev-GFP inhibition
occurs. Cells were washed to remove the compound,
replenished with fresh compound-free media, and then
assayed at 0, 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post wash-out.
At each time point the cells were prepared in duplicate
such that one set was treated with 1 nM b-LMB and
used for the XPO1 occupancy assay (Figure 7, Table 5),
while the other set was prepared for immuno-fluorescent
detection of Rev-GFP (Table 5). Figure 7 is the graphical
representation for the ratio of free-fraction XPO1 plotted
for each concentration of selinexor at each time point post
wash-out. The horizontal line demarcates the 50% XPO1
occupancy by selinexor. Selinexor occupied XPO1 in a
dose-dependent manner at 0, 4, and 24 hours post washout (Figure 7). From 48 to 96 hours post wash-out 3 and
10 μM selinexor resulted in persistent XPO1 occupation
(Figure 7). 50% occupancy of XPO1 was maximized at 3
μM of selinexor at 48 hours and longer (Table 5). Similar
to the PBMCs time-course from treated mice (Figure 5B),
a single dose equivalent of selinexor demonstrates robust
and sustained target interaction with full saturation of
XPO1 occurring between 4–24 hours post-treatment both
in vivo and in vitro. Wash-out of selinexor in the Rev-GFP
assay showed that there was a decrease in inhibition of

Although the in vivo data indicated that selinexor
remained bound to XPO1 for up to 72 hours, it did not
address the question of whether XPO1 was continuously
inhibited over this period of time. To test whether timedependent XPO1 occupancy by selinexor correlated with
inhibition of activity, we used the U2OS Rev-GFP cells in the
XPO1 occupancy assay. First, these cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of selinexor (0–10 μM) for 1 hour,
followed by 1 nM b-LMB treatment for 1.5 hours, and then
analyzed by the XPO1 occupancy assay (Figure 6). Figure
6A shows the XPO1 protein levels detected from eluates and
inputs from the U2OS cells in each treatment group (β-actin
is a loading control). Figure 6B is the graphical representation
of the ratio of free-fraction XPO1 for each concentration of
selinexor from Figure 6A. Selinexor bound dose-dependently
to XPO1 in a similar fashion to MM.1S cells, with 50% of
XPO1 occupancy occurring at 0.02 μM and 90% at 0.48 μM
(compare to values in Table 3).
Since Rev-GFP cells were adequate for the XPO1
occupancy assay, these cells could be used to test the
correlation between drug-target interaction and inhibition
of protein activity. Rev-GFP cells were treated with 3 fold

Rev nuclear export with time. The time course revealed
a dose-dependent response to selinexor, with Rev-GFP
being retained in the nucleus at IC50 values of 1.3 μM
selinexor at 48 hours, 6.8 μM at 72 hours, and 11.4 μM
at 96 hours (Table 5). Comparison of these Rev-GFP IC50
values to the corresponding 50% XPO1 occupancy values
suggests that administration of a low dose of selinexor
more frequently is as effective as administration of a
higher dose of selinexor given less often. These results
indicate that there is a correlation between the amounts
of drug administered to the persistence of target binding
coupled with inhibition of protein activity.

biotinylated SINE compounds were developed as a
more relevant comparison to untagged SINE compound
for patient samples. KPT-9085, the biotinylated version
of KPT-276, and KPT-9511, the biotinylated version of
KPT-8602 (Figure 1) were less potent in Rev-GFP and in
MTT assays compared to their unmodified counterparts
(Table 7). KPT-9058 was ~18-fold less potent in Rev-GFP
compared to KPT-276 (961 vs. 53 nM) and ~6-fold less
cytotoxic (110 nM vs. 18 nM). KPT-9511 was ~5 fold
less potent in Rev-GFP compared to KPT-8602 (230 nM
vs 42 nM) and ~15 fold less cytotoxic (280 vs 19 nM).
Both biotinylated compounds, however, showed dosedependent binding to XPO1 and a binding ratio of 1:1 with
their unmodified counterparts in the XPO1 occupancy
assay (Figure 8, Table 8). MM.1S cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of KPT-9058 (Figure
8A) or KPT-9511 (Figure 8B) and the corresponding
50% occupancy values were determined to be 0.12 μM
for KPT-9058 and 0.18 μM for KPT-9511. MM.1S cells
were then treated with increasing concentrations of either
selinexor (Figure 8C) or KPT-8602 (Figure 8D) followed
by treatment with 0.1 μM of either KPT-9058 or KPT9511. 50% and 90% XPO1 occupancy values were similar
for each unmodified SINE compound/biotinylated SINE
compound pair (Table 8). Selinexor had 50% and 90%
XPO1 occupancy values of 0.03 and 0.1 μM with KPT9058, and KPT-8602 had 50% and 90% occupancy values
of 0.02 and 0.11 μM with KPT-9511. For both selinexor
and KPT-8602, the 90% occupancy values were equal to
the amount of biotinylated SINE compound used for the
assay, indicating a 1:1 ratio of binding of unmodified SINE
compound compared to the biotinylated SINE compound.
These data suggest that biotinylated SINE compounds
can be used as tools to effectively evaluate the binding
capacity of SINE compounds to XPO1 protein for research
purposes.

XPO1 occupancy by selinexor occurs to the same
extent regardless of drug sensitivity
To test whether the XPO1 occupancy assay can
predict sensitivity of cancer cells to selinexor treatment,
it was performed on a panel of cell lines from many
different types of both solid and hematological cancers
each with various levels of selinexor sensitivity (by MTT,
IC50 values). Table 6 lists each cell line tested in the XPO1
occupancy assay compared to the corresponding selinexor
IC50 (sensitive to resistant). Regardless of sensitivity to
selinexor by IC50 values, all cell lines tested had similar
50% and 90% occupancy values. However, when the
XPO1 input areas for each cell type were averaged and
then divided by the number of cells used for the assay,
there was a strong correlation between the relative amount
of XPO1 protein per cell and the sensitivity of that cell
type to selinexor by the MTT assay. This result indicates
that while loading of the drug into the XPO1 target occurs
by the same kinetics in sensitive and resistant cells, high
XPO1 protein levels itself could predict drug resistance.

Biotinylated SINE compounds are tools for
evaluating SINE-XPO1 occupancy

DISCUSSION

Despite the fact that the XPO1 occupancy assay
may not be able to predict patient response to selinexor,
the assay could potentially be used to measure drug
delivery and XPO1 inhibition. Since b-LMB is not
pharmacologically relevant to SINE compounds, we next
used this assay to compare the ability of other biotintagged SINE compounds to bind to XPO1. Initially biotin
was added to selinexor, but the modification significantly
impaired the potency of the compound and therefore
was not able to be utilized in the assay. Next, additional

Selinexor is currently being evaluated in Phase I
and II clinical trials to treat patients with both solid and
hematological malignancies. In addition to pharmacological
measurements, it is clinically beneficial to develop an
assay that will assess the level of target occupancy. Similar
occupancy assays have been developed for other drug-target
interactions such as ibrutinib/Bruton tyrosine kinase [35,
36] and MDX-1106/programmed death-1 [37] proteins.

Figure 5: PMBCs from mice dosed with selinexor show dose- and time-dependent responses of XPO1 occupancy. A.

Mice (n = 4 per dose) were administered a single oral gavage of either 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3, or 10 mg/kg of selinexor for 4 hours, were terminally
bled, and then PBMCs were processed for the XPO1 occupancy assay. Ratio of free-fraction XPO1 versus selinexor dose is shown (see how
calculated below). B. Mice (n = 4 per dose per time point) were dosed once with either 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg selinexor and terminally bled at
4, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours post-dose. PBMCs were processed for the XPO1 occupancy assay. Ratio of free-fraction XPO1 versus
selinexor dose for each time point is shown which was calculated by dividing the mean peak areas of XPO1 occupied by b-LMB (from the
eluate) by the total amount of XPO1 (from the input), normalized to the corresponding selinexor-free control.

difference in cancer cell sensitivity to selinexor observed
in cytotoxicity assays. We predicted that sensitive cells
would have increased XPO1 occupancy at a lower drug
concentration, and therefore utilize a patient’s cancer

cells to predict a positive response to selinexor. We
found, however, that selinexor was capable of binding to
XPO1 similarly in all cell types tested regardless of their
sensitivity to selinexor. Hence this assay demonstrated that

drug sensitivity was determined by factors downstream of
drug-target interaction and possibly by overexpression
of the XPO1 target. We also found that different SINE
compounds bound XPO1 with a potency that correlated
with their capacity to inhibit nuclear export by the RevGFP assay and to induce cell death by MTT assay.
Additionally, we found that the binding of selinexor to
XPO1 was prolonged and sustained whereby saturation
was achieved at 4–24 hours and persisted for up to 72
hours both in vitro and in vivo after a single administration
indicating that dosing of patients could be further
optimized.
Although this assay successfully correlated
occupancy of XPO1 to dosing level, this assay revealed
no correlation of XPO1 occupancy to efficacy across
a diverse panel of cell lines. Therefore, we can
conclude that the difference in response to selinexor is
downstream of XPO1 inhibition. We came to this same
conclusion when we compared the parental HT1080
(fibrosarcoma) cell line to the in vitro-generated
selinexor resistant counterpart [38]. Comparison of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sensitive parental cells to resistant cells by microarray
analysis revealed differences in pathways related to
adhesion, apoptosis, and inflammation. Given the vast
number of cargoes which rely on XPO1 for nuclear
transport it is reasonable to suspect that selinexor
response may be governed by the cellular context of
signaling mechanisms downstream of nuclear export
inhibition and the differential dependence of tumor
cell survival on these downstream mechanisms in
one type of cancer versus another. Indeed the concept
of oncogene addiction is now known to play a role
in growth and survival of certain tumor types, and
exploitation of this concept has led to some successful
precision cancer therapeutics [39, 40]. The same
general principle may apply to XPO1 inhibition, where
in a particular tumor cell context, cell survival is
exquisitely dependent on the cytoplasmic localization
(or reduced nuclear localization) of an XPO1 cargo.
In particular this concept of differential dependence
on XPO1 cargo localization based on cellular context
is further supported by the observation that normal,
1873

non-malignant cells are more resistant to apoptosis
induced by XPO1 inhibition than their malignant
counterparts [25].
Our studies indicate that cancer cell response
to selinexor therapy is determined by pathways
downstream of XPO1 inhibition, and in at least 4
out of 7 selinexor resistant cell lines, could also be
determined by overexpression of the XPO1 target. Such
an overexpression enhances exclusion of essential TSPs
and GRPs from the nucleus and supports unregulated
cell division. This observation should be further tested in
additional cell lines as well in biopsies of selinexor treated
patients where drug response is documented.
The XPO1 occupancy assay could be used to
determine direct inhibition of XPO1 in a specific tumor
biopsies but only from intact and viable cells. To use this
assay in biopsies of solid tumors additional optimization
steps are needed. Optimization of the solid tumor XPO1
occupancy assay would most likely include immediate
collagenase treatment of biopsies after collection onsite, cryopreservation, and then shipment to a central
laboratory. While the assay has not been optimized for
solid tumors, it is available for the measurement of XPO1
occupancy in patient PBMCs ex vivo. Therefore, the next
step of implementing XPO1 occupancy in a clinical trial
is to perform the assay with purified cancer cells from
hematological patient bone marrow.
Based on our occupancy assay we predict that
modulation of pathways downstream of XPO1 may confer
resistance to selinexor. Alternatively, resistance to SINE
compounds could develop through mutations in the cargo
binding pocket of XPO1, i.e. a spontaneous mutation of
Cys528 [41]. Since our experiments indicated that the
affinity of XPO1 for selinexor is relatively similar across
a panel of selinexor sensitive and resistant cell lines, a
mutation in the cargo binding pocket of XPO1 is highly
unlikely. However, further investigation is warranted
to determine how mutations present in the XPO1 cargo
binding site might affect compound occupancy. Based on
these predicted results, our occupancy assay could be used
to identify patients with XPO1 mutations who might not
respond to selinexor and could benefit from alternative
therapies.

Rev-GFP assay
For the typical Rev-GFP assay, U2OS cells
stably expressing Rev-GFP [42] were cultured in 96
well plates at 7,500 - 15,000 cells/well. U2OS cells
were treated with serial dilutions of selinexor (started
at 10 μM; 1:3 dilution), LMB (started at 100 nM; 1:3
dilution), or b-LMB (started at 100 nM; 1:3 dilution) for
4 hours, then collected, washed with PBS, and fixed with
3% paraformaldehyde solution for at least 15 minutes
at room temperature. For the wash-out experiment,
complete media changed was performed after 4 hours
of treatment with selinexor and cells were collected for
fixation at 0, 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-selinexor
wash-out. After fixation cells were stained with DAPI
(Invitrogen) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells
were imaged with a Nikon fluorescent microscope at 10X
magnification and intensity of the GFP and nuclear area
were measured and recorded. Cells were scored as either
GFP nuclear positive or negative. Number of positive
cells were divided by total number of cells in order to
calculate percentage of cells with nuclear GFP per well.
XLFit model 205 was used to calculate IC50 curves to
report the amount of drug necessary to cause nuclear
retention of Rev-GFP in 50% of the cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates.
Titrating concentrations of KPT-330, KPT-335, KPT-350,
KPT-8602, b-LMB, or leptomycin B (LMB) were added
to the wells and incubated at 37°C in a 5% humidified CO2
incubator for 72 hours. Triplicate wells per concentration
were used to calculate IC50 curves. The CellTiter-Fluor Cell
Viability Assay (Promega) was performed as instructed by
the manufacturer. The whole procedure was repeated three
times. The inhibitory rate of cell growth was calculated using
the formula: % growth inhibition = (1− OD extract treated)/
OD negative control × 100) [43].

isolation. For dose-response, mice (n = 4 per group)
were orally administered 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3, or 10 mg/kg
selinexor and terminally bled after 4 hours. For time
course, mice (n = 4 per group) were administered 0,

24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Mouse whole blood was
collected in Vacutainer® EDTA tubes (BD) and pooled
from each group for each time point. Human and mouse
PBMCs were separated by Ficoll (GE Healthcare)
gradient. Human PMBCs were cryogenically preserved
in Recovery™ Cell Culture Freezing Medium
(Gibco). Freshly isolated or previously frozen human
donor PBMCs were treated ex vivo with titrating
concentrations of selinexor for 1 (fresh) or 4 (revived)
hours followed by treatment with 1 nM b-LMB for 1
hour and were subsequently collected for processing for
the XPO1 occupancy assay. Freshly isolated PBMCs
from control or selinexor-treated mice were treated ex
vivo with 1 nM b-LMB for 1.5 hours prior to collection
and processing for the XPO1 occupancy assay.
