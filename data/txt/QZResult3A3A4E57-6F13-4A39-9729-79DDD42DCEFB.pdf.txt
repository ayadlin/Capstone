Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

HOTAIR is a long intervening non-coding RNA (lincRNA) that associates with the Polycomb
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and overexpression is correlated with poor survival for breast,
colon and liver cancer patients. In this study, we show that HOTAIR expression is increased in
pancreatic tumors compared to non-tumor tissue and is associated with more aggressive tumors.
Knockdown of HOTAIR (siHOTAIR) by RNA interference shows that HOTAIR plays an
important role in pancreatic cancer cell invasion and as reported in other cancer cell lines. In
contrast, HOTAIR knockdown in Panc1 and L3.6pL pancreatic cancer cells that overexpress this
lincRNA decreased cell proliferation, altered cell cycle progression, and induced apoptosis,
demonstrating an expanded function for HOTAIR in pancreatic cancer cells compared to other
cancer cell lines. Results of gene array studies showed that there was minimal overlap between
HOTAIR-regulated genes in pancreatic vs. breast cancer cells and HOTAIR uniquely suppressed
several interferon-related genes and gene sets related to cell cycle progression in pancreatic cancer
cells and tumors. Analysis of selected genes suppressed by HOTAIR in Panc1 and L3.6 pL cells
showed by knockdown of EZH2 and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that HOTAIRmediated gene repression was both PRC2-dependent and -independent. HOTAIR knockdown in
L3.6pL cells inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft model, further demonstrating the prooncogenic function of HOTAIR in pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Studies on the human, mouse and other genomes have demonstrated that a large number of
genes and their corresponding RNAs are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are differentially
expressed in various organs and tissues.1–4 The functions of some ncRNAs have been
characterized and it is evident that they are key factors in gene regulation and influence
normal and cancer cell phenotypes.4–8 Among the different classes of ncRNAs, microRNAs
(miRs) have been the most extensively investigated, and it is estimated that >1000 miRs
regulate up to 30% of all protein encoding genes.7–10 Several miRs are overexpressed in
different tumors and their functional pro-oncogenic activity is usually associated with
induction of oncogenes or inhibition of multiple genes with tumor suppressor-like
activity.11–13
Rinn and coworkers have identified up to 3000 human long intervening non-coding RNAs
(lincRNAs),14, 15 and biological characterization studies suggest that lincRNAs have
important functions in both normal and cancer tissues.14–19 There is evidence that many
lincRNAs act as scaffolds that regulate molecular (protein, RNA, DNA) interactions
required for various signaling networks15–17 and this is accomplished, in part, by association
with chromatin-modifying complexes.

HOTAIR is a 2,158 bp lincRNA localized to a boundary in the HOXC gene cluster.
HOTAIR is a negative prognostic factor for breast, colon and liver cancer patient survival,
and increased HOTAIR expression in patients has been correlated with enhanced breast and
colon cancer metastasis.14, 20–23 HOTAIR expression has been linked to increased breast,
liver and colon cancer cell invasiveness, whereas RNA interference (RNAi) studies in liver
cancer cells showed that HOTAIR alone had minimal effects alone on cell viability or
apoptosis but enhanced the activities of other agents.22 The activity of HOTAIR is due, in
part, to interaction of HOTAIR with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (EZH2,
SUZ12 and EED) which enhances H3K27 trimethylation to decrease expression of multiple
genes. Other lincRNAs also associate with PRC2 and other chromatin complexes,
suggesting potential gene repressive activity similar to that described for HOTAIR.15

Initial data mining studies of publically available data bases24–26 showed that HOTAIR was
overexpressed in pancreatic tumors compared to the normal pancreas and more highly
expressed in advanced tumors.24 HOTAIR exhibited variable expression in pancreatic
cancer cells, and knockdown of HOTAIR in Panc1 and L3.6pL pancreatic cancer cells by
RNAi showed that HOTAIR was associated with enhanced cell invasion, cell proliferation,
modulation of cell cycle progression, and induction of apoptosis. HOTAIR knockdown in
L3.6pL cells also inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Knockdown of
HOTAIR in Panc1 cells resulted in significant (>1.5) changes in expression of 1006 genes
and analysis of the data suggested that HOTAIR-mediated gene regulation plays a critical

role in pancreatic cancer progression and will be a novel epigenetic molecular target for
treating pancreatic cancer patients.

RESULTS

Author Manuscript

Data mining of publically available gene profiling results 24–26 showed that among 36
pancreatic cancer patients,25 HOTAIR was more highly expressed in pancreatic tumors
compared to non-tumor tissue (Fig. 1A) and HOTAIR was more highly expressed in tumors
extending beyond the pancreas (T3) compared to tumors only detected in the pancreas (T2)
and more highly expressed in tumors spread to regional lymph nodes (N1) compared to
tumors localized only in the pancreas (NO) (Fig. 1B).24 In this same study,24 Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis showed that patients with low HOTAIR expression (bottom 85%) had
significantly increased overall survival compared to patients with high HOTAIR expression
(top 15%), and additional summaries of patient data are provided in Supplemental Figure
S1. Furthermore, the result of Cox proportional hazard regression analysis consistently
indicates that HOTAIR levels and N stage are strongly correlated with overall patient
survival (p < 0.05) (Table S2). Figure 1C illustrates plots from gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) using pancreatic patient gene profiling data (GSE21501) showing that gene set
differences in HOTAIR high vs. low patients indicated that HOTAIR regulates gene sets
mainly associated with cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (Supplemental Table
S3).14 Figure 1D illustrates that HOTAIR was highly expressed in Panc1 and L3.6pL cells,
whereas lower expression was observed in Panc28, MiaPac-2 and BxPC3 cells. These
results overlapped with data mining from array data from several pancreatic cancer cell
lines26 which also showed that HOTAIR was overexpressed in Panc1 cells (Fig. 1D).

Panc1 cells are a highly aggressive “basal-like” pancreatic cancer cell line, and knockdown
of HOTAIR by RNA interference (siHOTAIR) resulted in changes in expression (>1.5 fold)
of 1006 genes in which expression of 454 genes was enhanced and expression of 552 genes
was decreased (Supplemental Fig. S2A). HOTAIR knockdown was performed using two
different siRNAs (siHOTAIR I and siHOTAIR II) to avoid off-target effects. Results from
GSEA using gene ontology (GO) terms showed that 20 significant gene sets were affected
by HOTAIR knockdown in Panc1 cells compared to control (siCT) cells (Supplemental
Table S4). Since 10 out of the 20 GO terms were related to the cell cycle (Fig. 2A and
Supplemental Table S3), we concluded that HOTAIR regulation of cell viability and cell
cycle progression was important in both pancreatic cancer cells and patients (Fig. 1C).20–23

Author Manuscript

Previous studies characterized HOTAIR-regulated genes by overexpression of this ncRNA
in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells,20 and Figure 2B shows that there were 241 common
genes among 1006 and 9,260 genes (>1.5 fold change) modulated by HOTAIR knockdown
or overexpression in Panc1 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, respectively (summarized in
Supplemental Tables S5 – S6). Since the HOTAIR-regulated genes were determined by
opposite procedures (knockdown vs. overexpression) in Panc1 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
respectively, we compared heat maps of the genes induced or repressed by HOTAIR
knockdown or overexpression in both cell lines (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Table S7). The
heat map illustrates the limited overlap between the 241 genes regulated by HOTAIR in
Panc1 and MDA-MB-231 cells and this is further evidenced in the bar graphs (Fig. 2B)

showing that among the 119 genes induced in Panc1 cells by siHOTAIR II, only 27 of these
genes (green color) were repressed in MDA-MB-231 cells by HOTAIR overexpression
(Supplemental Table S7) whereas among the 122 genes repressed after HOTAIR KO in
Panc1 cells only 24 genes were induced (blue color). Moreover, siHOTAIR resulted in the
repression of 122 genes in Panc1 cells and only 18 of these genes were induced by HOTAIR
overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells.20 HOTAIR plays an important role in PRC2mediated gene suppression. Supplemental Figure S2 and Table S7 compares HOTAIRregulated genes in Panc1 cells with HOTAIR/PRC2-coregulated genes in MDA-MB-231 (in
a ChIP assay) and there were only 9 genes in common (Supplemental Fig. S2B and Table
S7) but only minimal overlap between PRC2-regulated genes induced by siHOTAIR in
Panc1 cells and genes suppressed by HOTAIR overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells. We
further investigated differences in HOTAIR regulated genes in Panc1 and MDA-MB-231
cells by comparing specific genes repressed and induced by HOTAIR overexpression in the
latter cell line.20 Among 3 genes repressed by HOTAIR overexpression in MDA-MB-231
cells (PCDHB5, PCDH10 and JAM2), two were enhanced after HOTAIR knockdown in
Panc1 and L3.6pL cells, but only JAM2 expression was enhanced in both cell lines (Fig.
2C). LAMB3, ABL2, SNA1 and LAMC2 were induced by HOTAIR overexpression in
MDA-MB-231 cells;20 however, none of these genes were repressed by siHOTAIR in either
Panc1 or L3.6pL cells (Fig. 2D), and two of the four genes (ABL2 and SNA1) were induced
in both cell lines. These results confirm that HOTAIR regulates significantly different sets
of genes in pancreatic vs. breast cancer cells.

HOTAIR knockdown induces or represses multiple genes that could contribute to the
functional pro-oncogenic activity of HOTAIR in Panc1 cells (Fig. 2A; Supplemental Tables
S5 and S6). We further examined expression of 7 genes with tumor suppressor-like
activity27–36 that are constitutively suppressed by HOTAIR and induced in Panc1 cells after
transfection with siHOTAIR. Figure 3A demonstrates that siHOTAIR I significantly
induced expression of GDF15, IL29, IL28A, IL28B, IFTM1, OAS1 and MX1 mRNA in
Panc1 and L3.6pL cells. The role of the PRC2 complex in coregulating suppression of these
HOTAIR-suppressed genes was investigated by EZH2 knockdown (siEZH2), and only
GDF15 mRNA expression was induced in Panc1 and L3.6pL cells transfected with siEZH2
(Fig. 3B) and similar results were observed for knockdown of Suz12, another member of the
PRC2 complex (Fig. 3C). GDF15 is a growth inhibitory/proapoptotic gene,27, 28 and ChIP
analysis (Fig. 3D) shows that primers directed at the proximal region of the GDF15
promoter detected H3K27 trimethylation and EZH2 binding but not RNA pol II interactions
in Panc1 cells transfected with siCT (control). In contrast, knockdown of HOTAIR resulted
in the loss of H3K27 trimethylation and EZH2 binding but increased interaction of RNA pol
II with the promoter region and this is consistent with cooperative PRC2/HOTAIR induction
of GDF15 (Fig. 3A–3C). The effects of HOTAIR on GDF15 were further evaluated using
two different siRNAs for HOTAIR in order to minimize possible off-target effects; both
siHOTAIR I and II exhibited a similar level of knockdown efficiency. Both siRNAs for
HOTAIR decreased luciferase activity in Panc1 cells transfected with constructs containing
the proximal −3500 to +41, −1086 to +41, and −474 to +41 regions of the GDF15 promoter
(Fig. 3E), whereas effects of siHOTAIR were minimal in Panc1 cells transfected with a
construct containing only the −133 to +41 region of the promoter. These results suggest that

HOTAIR/PRC2 coordinately regulate GDF15 in pancreatic cancer cells; in contrast, this
gene was not affected by HOTAIR overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells,20 further
demonstrating cell context-dependent differences in HOTAIR/PRC2-regulated genes.
Identification of other HOTAIR/PRC2-regulated genes in pancreatic cancer cells and tumors
is currently being investigated and we expect that GDF15 is only one of several
proapoptotic/growth inhibitory genes suppressed by this complex.

Since MiaPaCa2 and Panc28 cells express relatively low levels of HOTAIR, we further
investigated the functional and genomic effects of HOTAIR overexpression and compared
these results with overexpression of HOTAIR as previously reported in MDA-MB-231
cells20 and knockdown of HOTAIR in Panc1 and L3.6pL cells (Figs. 3A and 3B). HOTAIR
overexpression enhanced MiaPaCa2 and Panc28 cell invasion in a Boyden chamber assay
(Fig. 4A) and this was consistent with previous functional studies in breast and colon cancer
cells.20, 23 HOTAIR overexpression decreased PCDBH5 and PCDH10 [as observed in
MDA-MB-31 cells20] but not JAM2 in MiaPaCa2 cells, whereas in Panc28 cells PCDH10
and JAM2 were induced and PCDBH5 was unchanged by HOTAIR overexpression (Fig.
4B). In contrast, overexpression of HOTAIR either decreased or did not affect LAMB3,
ABL2, SNA1 or LAMC2 mRNA levels in MiaPaCa2 and Panc28 cells (Fig. 4B), whereas
these genes were all induced by HOTAIR overexpression in MDAMB-231 cell.20 The
HOTAIR repressed genes (e.g. Fig. 3A) were also investigated by overexpression of
HOTAIR in MiaPaCa2 and Panc28 cells. HOTAIR downregulated GDF15, MX1, IL28,
IL28A, IL28B and IL29 only in MiaPaCa2 cells (Fig. 4C) and the remaining genes were
unchanged in both cell lines. Overexpression of HOTAIR in MiaPaCa2 and Panc28 cells
increased cell proliferation (Fig. 4D) and the % of cells in S phase and decreased the % in
G2/M (Fig. 4E) in Panc28 but not in MiaPaCa2 cells. Thus, results of both HOTAIR
knockdown or overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells further demonstrate differences
between HOTAIR regulated genes in pancreatic vs. breast cancer cells and also show
differences in HOTAIR function in MiaPaCa2 and Panc28 cells that express low levels of
this ncRNA.

We further investigated the functional effects of siHOTAIR in Panc1 and L3.6pL cells that
overexpressed this ncRNA. Transfection of siHOTAIR I and II inhibited Panc1 and L3.6pL
growth which was significant after 4 days, and >50% growth inhibition was observed after 6
days (Fig. 5A). siHOTAIRs caused a G0/G1 to S phase arrest in Panc1 cells (32 hr), whereas
in L3.6pL cells there was a decrease in the percent cells in G0/G1 and increase in G2/M,
indicating pancreatic cancer cell context-dependent differences in the effects of HOTAIR on
cell cycle progression (Fig. 5B). siHOTAIRs significantly decreased Panc1 and L3.6pL
invasion using a Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 5C) and siHOTAIR II also enhanced Annexin
V staining associated with induction of apoptosis in Panc1 cells (Fig. 5C) and siHOTAIR
also induced PARP cleavage in both cell lines (data not shown). L3.6pL cells transfected
with siHOTAIR II were used in a mouse xenograft model and, up to 16 days after
knockdown of HOTAIR by RNA interference, there was a dramatic decrease in pancreatic
tumor volume and weight and HOTAIR expression (Fig. 5D). Supplemental Figure 3 also
shows that immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue indicates an increase in TUNEL
staining and a decrease in proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA) in siHOTAIR vs. siCT

transfected tumors. These in vivo data complement the functional in vitro studies of
HOTAIR and confirm the pro-oncogenic activity of this lincRNA in pancreatic cancer cells
and tumors.

DISCUSSION
HOTAIR was initially identified as one of 231 ncRNAs associated with human HOX loci,
and HOTAIR resided in the HOXC locus but repressed transcription in the more distal
HOXD locus in foreskin fibroblasts. HOTAIR interacted with the PRC2 complex and was
required for PRC2-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation and gene silencing.
HOTAIRM1 and HOTTIP are lincRNAs associated with the HOXA locus, and both
ncRNAs differentially modulate gene expression in various cell and tissue types, but genes/
pathways modulated by these lincRNAs are PRC2-independent.37, 38

HOTAIR has also been characterized as a negative prognostic factor in breast, liver and
colon cancer patients,20–23 and results of this study demonstrate that HOTAIR is also
overexpressed in human pancreatic tumors compared to non-tumor tissue (Fig. 1).
Moreover, there is also evidence that HOTAIR is more highly expressed in more aggressive
and invasive pancreatic tumors (Figs. 1A and 1B). HOTAIR function was investigated in
knockdown studies and indicates that this ncRNA enhances pancreatic cancer cell invasion,
inhibits cell growth, modulates cell cycle progression, and induces apoptosis in vitro, and
HOTAIR knockdown in L3.6pL cell inhibited tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing
these cells as xenografts (Fig. 5). Results of HOTAIR overexpression in MiaCaPa2 and
Panc28 cells were also consistent with the pro-oncogenic activity of HOTAIR, although
there were some cell context-dependent differences. Thus, HOTAIR not only plays a role in
invasion of pancreatic, breast, colon and liver cancer cells 20, 22, 23 but also exerts distinct
pro-oncogenic activities in pancreatic cancer associated with increased cell survival and
proliferation and repression of interferon-related genes. This was further supported by a
similar result from GSEA analysis of Panc1 cells (Fig. 2A) and human tumors (Fig. 1C),
showing that at least 50% of the gene sets were associated with cell cycle progression and
proliferation.

Author Manuscript

Modulation of HOTAIR expression in breast and colon cancer cells and tumors results in
both enhanced and suppressed expression of genes, and a subset of genes repressed by
HOTAIR in these cancer cells were also coregulated by PRC2.20, 23 A comparison of the
gene expression data modulated by HOTAIR overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells and
HOTAIR knockdown in Panc1 cells showed some overlap in expression of individual genes;
however, a heat map of induced/repressed genes illustrates significant differences between
the cell lines (Fig. 2). Moreover, only 9 of the 854 genes coregulated by HOTAIR/PRC2 in
MDA-MB-231 cells were also affected by HOTAIR knockdown in Panc1 cells
(Supplemental Fig. S2B and Table S8). Among these genes, only OC1AD2 and RSAD2
were induced in Panc1 cells, whereas only minimal repression was observed after HOTAIR
overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells.20
HOTAIR-dependent gene regulation in pancreatic cancer cells was investigated by HOTAIR
knockdown in Panc1 and L3.6pL cells and HOTAIR overexpression in Panc28 and

MiaPaCa2 cells using a set of genes repressed (JAM2, PCDH10, PCDHB5) and induced
(ABL2, SNAIL, LAMB3 and LAMC2) by HOTAIR overexpression in MDA-MB-231
cells.20 HOTAIR knockdown or overexpression gave variable results among the four
different pancreatic cancer cell lines (Figs. 2D, 2E and 4B) which in turn exhibited minimal
overlap with respect to HOTAIR-dependent regulation of this set of genes in MDA-MB-231
cells.20 These results were consistent with the differences observed in the gene arrays from
Panc1 vs. MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. S2).

Author Manuscript

A second set of genes identified in the microarray that were significantly induced after
HOTAIR knockdown were further investigated in Panc1 and L3.6pL cells transfected with
siHOTAIR, and all were induced in both cell lines (Figs. 3A and 3B). Previous studies show
that all seven genes exhibit tumor suppressor-like activities,27–36 and four genes, namely
IL29, IL28A, IL28B and IFTM1, were among a subset of several interferon-regulated genes
suppressed by HOTAIR in Panc1 cells (Supplemental Table S4). Transfection of Panc1 and
L3.6pL cells with siEZH2, a key component of the PRC2 complex, or siSuz12, another
PRC2 component, showed that only GDF15 was coregulated by HOTAIR and EZH2
(PRC2) (Figs. 3A, 3B and 3D), and ChIP assays in cells transfected with siCT vs.
siHOTAIR confirmed that GDF15 was a HOTAIR/PRC2-regulated gene (Fig. 3C). In
contrast, the interferon-related genes were not affected by EZH2 knockdown and the
mechanisms of PRC2-independent but HOTAIR-mediated suppression of these genes are
currently being investigated. These observations are consistent with recent reports showing
that HOTAIR regulation of multiple genes is EZH2-indendent.21, 39 Consistent results were
observed for the HOTAIR-regulated gene sets in pancreatic cancer patients (Fig. 1C) and
after HOTAIR knockdown in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that knockdown
of endogenous HOTAIR rather than overexpression may be preferable for investigating
ncRNA-dependent gene regulation and function.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we show that HOTAIR is a negative prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer
patients and exhibits pro-oncogenic activity in both in vitro and in vivo bioassays. HOTAIRdependent gene regulation in pancreatic cancer cells is complex and differs significantly
from a previous report in breast cancer cells.20 Nevertheless, HOTAIR knockdown in cells
overexpressing this ncRNA gave consistent results using a subset of highly regulated genes,
suggesting that HOTAIR-mediated suppression of genes in pancreatic cancer is both PRC2dependent and PRC2-independent. Current studies are focused on mechanisms associated
with suppression and activation of genes by HOTAIR in pancreatic cancer and development
of therapeutic strategies that target HOTAIR.

bicarbonate, 0.011% sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10 ml/l 100×
antibiotic antimycotic solution (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
Pancreatic cancer patient gene profiling data (GSE20501) was obtained from Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) site. The patients are classified into two groups according to
their HOTAIR expression level (top 15%: high vs. bottom 85%: low) and GSEA was carried
out to assess the effects of HOTAIR expression level on various biological pathways using
these two classified data sets. Similarly, GSEA was also performed using gene profiling data
sets obtained from control siRNA control vs. HOTAIR siRNA (siHOTAIR I) transfected
Panc1 cells. Significantly enriched biological pathways were identified, which produced
nominal p-value < 0.05 and false discovery rates (FDR) < 0.25.

RNA isolation and quantative PCR
Total RNA was extracted either from pancreatic cancer cell lines or tissue samples. Five
control and siRNA HOTAIR transfected tissue samples were analyzed, respectively, from
xenograft study using mirVana™ RNA isolation kit from Ambion (Austin, TX), and
quantative PCR was carried out using iCycler IQTM real time PCR detection system (BioRad, Hercules, CA) after reverse transcription to cDNAs. The RT primer sets for HOTAIR,
PCDHB5, PCDH10, JAM2, LAMB3, ABL2, SNAI and LAMC2 were used as previously
described.20 All other primer sets and sequences are shown in Supplemental Table S1.
siRNA transfection and luciferase assay

Author Manuscript

Pancreatic cancer cells were transfected with 100 nM of control siRNA or HOTAIR siRNA
I (SASI_Hs02_00380445) or HOTAIR siRNA II (SASI_Hs02_00380446) purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Panc1 cells were
cotransfected with control siRNA or HOTAIR siRNA I and HOTAIR II, and various length
of GDF15 luciferase constructs. Luciferase activities were measured after 24 hr as
previously described.40, 41 MISSION® siRNAs for EZH2 and Suz12 were also purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)

Author Manuscript

Antibodies for RNA polymerase, EZH2 and Histone H3 trimethyl Lys 27 antibodies were
obtained from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA), and ChIP assay was performed as previously
described.41 The ChIP primer sequences: (forward) 5'-GGAGCACCCTGCTTAGACTG-3'
and (reverse) 5'-GGGCCTCAGTATCCTCTTCC-3', which amplified 5' promoter region
(−680 ~ −190) of GDF15 gene.
Boyden chamber cell invasion and apoptosis assays
Pancreatic cancer cells either transfected with siRNAs (HOTAIR vs. control) or expression
vectors (empty vs. HOTAIR) and cell invasion assay was performed as described
previously.41 Cells were transfected with siCT or siHOTAIR and after 72 hr, cells were
stained for Annexin V using the Vibrant apoptosis assay kit as described.42

Cell proliferation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and apoptosis

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with either appropriate siRNA or
expression vectors and cell numbers were counted at the indicated times using a Coulter Z1
cell counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). For FACS analysis, after pancreatic cancer
cells transfected with siRNA either for control or HOTAIRs, cells were stained with
propidium iodide solution and were analyzed on a FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (Becton
Dickinsin Systems, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
Xenograft study

Author Manuscript

L3.6pL cells (6×104 mL) were transfected with 100 nM siHOTAIR or siCT using
Lipofectamine and after 48 hr, cells were collected and 1×106 cells injected into either side
of the flank area of female nude mice (Harlan), and tumor volumes and weights were
determined in mice from the siHOTAIR (6 mice) or siCT (6 mice) groups as described,43
and siHOTAIR levels were determined by real time PCR. Tumor volumes were measured
(0.5 × length × width2) and after 16 days, the mice were sacrificed and tumor weights were
measured and also used for further analysis as described.41–43
Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay

Author Manuscript

Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and treated with graded series of alcohol and
rehydrated in PBS. Antigen retrieval was done using 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0–6.2)
and endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 6 min.
Slides were then incubated with blocking serum (Vecstatin ABC Elite kit, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 45 min. Samples were then incubated overnight with
Ki-67 and PCNA antibodies at 4°C. Sections were then washed in PBST and then incubated
with biotinylated secondary antibody followed by streptavidin. The brown staining specific
for antibody binding was developed by exposing the avidin and biotinylated peroxidase
complex to diaminobenzidine reagent (Vector Laboratories) and sections were then
counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories). The in situ cell death detection POD
kit was used for the terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) assay according to the instructions in the protocol for tissue sections.
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Statistical significance of differences between different groups was determined using
Student's t-test. Gene profiling data was either analyzed by BRB-Array Tools44 or Gene
Pattern software.45 Cluster and Treeview programs were employed for generation of heat
map and for gene clustering.46 Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were applied to
evaluate a prognostic significance of HOTAIR expression level in terms of patient survival.
Cox proportional hazard regression model was also used to evaluate independent prognostic
factors correlated with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis.
