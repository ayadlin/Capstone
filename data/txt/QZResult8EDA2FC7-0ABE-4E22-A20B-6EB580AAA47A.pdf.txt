ABSTRACT
Many different aberrations in the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) were found
to be oncogenic drivers in several cancers including neuroblastoma (NB), therefore
ALK is now considered a critical player in NB oncogenesis and a promising therapeutic
target. The ALK-inhibitor crizotinib has a limited activity against the various ALK
mutations identified in NB patients.
We tested: the activity of the novel ALK-inhibitor X-396 administered alone or
in combination with Targeted Liposomes carrying ALK-siRNAs (TL[ALK-siRNA]) that
are active irrespective of ALK gene mutational status; the pharmacokinetic profiles
and the biodistribution of X-396; the efficacy of X-396 versus crizotinib treatment
in NB xenografts; whether the combination of X-396 with the TL[ALK-siRNA] could
promote long-term survival in NB mouse models.
X-396 revealed good bioavailability, moderate half-life, high mean plasma and
tumor concentrations. X-396 was more effective than crizotinib in inhibiting in vitro
cell proliferation of NB cells and in reducing tumor volume in subcutaneous NB models
in a dose-dependent manner.
In orthotopic NB xenografts, X-396 significantly increased life span independently
of the ALK mutation status. In combination studies, all effects were significantly
improved in the mice treated with TL[ALK-siRNA] and X-396 compared to mice
receiving the single agents.
Our findings provide a rational basis to design innovative molecular-based
treatment combinations for clinical application in ALK-driven NB tumors.

stages with metastatic disease. Despite aggressive and
multi-modal therapies (i.e. aggressive chemotherapy,
surgery, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation,
immunotherapy) the effective treatment of advanced NB
is still a challenge for paediatric oncology [1, 2].
Over the years, many genes have been encountered
to have potential roles in NB pathogenesis, but the NB
causing genes remained unidentified. The identification of
germline and somatic activating mutations in the tyrosine
kinase domain of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)
gene as well as amplification, rearrangments and/or over
expression of either mutated or wild-type ALK allelesrevealed that such aberrations are oncogenic drivers in NB
and correlate with worse patients’ outcome or unfavourable
aggressive NB phenotype [3–7]. Notably, as both ALK and
MYCN oncogene are located in close proximity to each
other on chromosome 2p, amplification of MYCN can also
involve amplification of the ALK locus [3, 4, 7, 8]. When
expressed together, ALK and MYCN promote NIH3T3 cell
transformation and both wild-type and activated mutant
forms of ALK stimulate transcription of MYCN [9].
Therefore, ALK has emerged as a critical player in
NB and tractable ‘oncogene’ opening new perspectives
into the design and development of gene-targeted
therapies for NB and other ALK-driven cancers [8, 10,
11], such as Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC)
[12] and Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphomas (ALCL) [13]
characterized by oncogenic ALK fusion proteins arising
from chromosomal translocations.
ALK tyrosine kinase domain mutations account for
8–10% of diagnosed NB at three hot spots accounting for
85% of mutations: R1275 (43%), F1174 (30%), and F1245
(12%) and 13 minor sites, and correlated significantly with
poorer survival in high- and intermediate-risk NB [3–8].
The success of various tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the
treatment of different cancers as well as the increased number
of human malignancies involving aberrant ALK activity, both
in children and adults, encouraged the search and motivated
the development of ALK-selective small-molecule inhibitors.
Crizotinib, the only ALK-inhibitor approved by Food and
Drug Administration (FDA, USA), showed limited activity
against ALK-driven NB [14]. The mutated variants also
showed differential in vitro crizotinib sensitivities [8].
The most aggressive ALK-mutation in NB,
ALKF1174L, has been described as a relapse-specific
mutation correlating with unresponsiveness to therapy
[15]. ALKF1174L also arises as a secondary event after an
initial response to crizotinib [16] and is able to potentiate
the oncogene activity of MYCN [17]. To overcome
acquired resistance to crizotinib, different categories of
next-generation ALK-inhibitors have been developed
and are subject of various pre-clinical studies or earlyphase trials [18]. However, there is no certainty that these
compounds will be more potent than crizotinib against
ALK-mutants. In this view, Xcovery (West Palm Beach,
FL) has developed a novel and powerful small molecule
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ALK-inhibitor named X-396 (http://www.xcovery.com).
The potency and the selectivity of X-396 were validated
by comparison with other ALK-inhibitors available
and tested in animal models of Non-Small-Cell Lung
Cancer (NSCLC). Noteworthy, X-396 is active against
multiple ALK variants founds in NSCLC, including
ALK mutations associated with acquired resistance to
crizotinib [10]. Indeed, in June 2012, X-396 entered a
Phase 1 safety trial in patients with solid tumors [11] (for
details see NCT01625234 at http://www.clinicaltrials.
gov). Preliminary clinical data have shown that X-396
is generally well-tolerated and has anti-tumor activity in
patients with NSCLC bearing an ALK fusion protein [19].
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that X-396
could be more effective than crizotinib on NB cells
bearing in either of the two more common ALK-mutations,
ALKF1174L or ALKR1275Q [20]. In addition, we believe that
novel combination strategies that increase the efficacy of
ALK-inhibitors like X-396 without increasing toxicities in
children are potentially relevant.
To this regard, we have successfully developed and
validated by in vitro and in vivo studies a RNAi-mediated
therapeutic approach to selectively knockdown ALK
expression by using NB targeted nanoliposomes [21, 22].
Since our formulation is a safe and powerful siRNA-based
therapeutic tool for NB, we thought it may be ideal to
combine with an ALK kinase inhibitor. Here we present
results aimed at testing whether a combined therapeutic
approach using the novel inhibitor X-396 working on ALK
at protein level, and the NB targeted liposomal siRNAs
against ALK working at mRNA level, could represent an
improved strategy with additive and/or synergistic effects
to promote long-term survival in NB xenografts.

RESULTS
X-396 is a kinase inhibitor with higher potency
against ALK-mutated neuroblastoma-cell lines
than crizotinib in vitro
Pre-clinical studies have shown that NB cell lines
harbouring the F1174L mutation, the second most common
ALK-mutation seen in NB tumors, are significantly more
resistant to crizotinib than those harbouring the most common
mutation, R1275Q [16, 20]. For this reason, we first measured
3
H-thymidine uptake to assess the dose-dependent effect of
X-396 and crizotinib on the growth of two NB cell lines, each
one harbouring one of the hot spot-activating ALK-mutations:
LAN-5 carrying R1275Q ALK mutation (ALKR1275Q) and SHSY5Y carrying F1174L ALK mutation (ALKF1174L).
Although the slope of the curves between X-396
and crizotinib are similar, the differences between
the elevations were significantly different in both cell
lines. Specifically, in LAN-5 cells X-396 was 3.7-fold
more potent than crizotinib (IC50: crizotinib 328 nM,
X-396 88 nM) to decease cell growth (Figure 1A).

In vivo anti-tumor activity of X-396 against
human NB orthotopic xenografts

Lower effect (total fold increase 2.57) was registered in
SH-SY5Y cells(IC50: crizotinib 383 nM, X-396 149 nM)
(Figure 1B).
We next examined the activity of X-396 on the cell
viability of cultured NB cells by AlamarBlue staining.
Treatment with X-396 induced a statistically significant
dose-dependent decrease in cell viability compared with
the same dose of crizotinib (Figure 1C, 1D).
To confirm the target specificity of X-396, we
assessed the ability of the compound to reduce the
endogenous ALK phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y and LAN5 NB cells. Compared to crizotinib, X-396 inhibited ALK
phosphorylation at lower concentrations of drug (Figure
1E, 1F and Supplementary Figure S1).
The above results indicated that X-396 is an ALKinhibitor more powerful and gene-specific than crizotinib
in accordance with previous findings obtained by Lovly
et al [10].

We next asked whether the above anti-tumor results
could be recapitulated in a more clinically relevant mouse
model. To this purpose, we explored the effects of X-396
in biologically relevant orthotopic mouse models [23],
obtained by implanting of Luciferase-stably-transduced
NB cells, SH-SY5Y-Luc and LAN-5-Luc, into the adrenal
gland of nu/nu mice.
To avoid the possible stressful mice conditions,
due to the repeated oral gavage in the same day, BID, we
decided to administrate 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of X-396
in two mice groups only once a day (QD), starting 7 days
post cell implantation.
Treatments with X-396 did not revealed any sign
of toxicities (i.e. severe weight loss, dehydration or
abdominal dilatation). As clearly shown by in vivo BLI
(Figure 3A and 4A) capturing the Luciferase signal
intensity at day 22, X-396 treatments were able to slow
down the primary tumor growth. All data were confirmed
and quantified at day 29 by the fold increase of photon
counts over the time in the tumor region (Figure 3B and
4B), indicating a significant dose-dependent anti-tumor
activity of X-396 in both mouse models. In SH-SY5Y
xenografts the lower dose of X-396 (50 mg/kg QD) did
not significantly increase the mice life span compared
to control group, while a significant improvement of the
anti-tumor effect was obtained with the higher dose (100
mg/kg QD) (Figure 3C). This is consistent with the high
brain tissue concentration of X-396 when dosed at 100
mg/kg, where the mean is 138 ng/g 8 hours after dosing.
This concentration (~246 nM) is 1.7x the IC50, while that
at 50 mg/kg is only 34.6 ng/mL or ~61 nM which is below
the IC50 of 149 nM (Table 2). Noteworthy, either 50 mg/kg
QD or 100 mg/kg QD doses of X-396 exerted a significant
increased life span in LAN-5-bearing mice (Figure 4C).

Pharmacokinetic profile, biodistribution
properties and anti-tumor activity of X-396 in
subcutaneous NB mouse model
We next investigated the effects of X-396 in vivo, in
SH-SY5Y xenografts. Pharmacokinetic profiles revealed
that X-396, after multiple oral administrations by gavage
in NB xenograft mice, showed substantial bioavailability,
moderate half-life and slow absorption in vivo (time of the
maximum concentration (TMAX: 2 h). At the low dose of
25 mg/kg, the mean plasma concentration 2 hours after the
last dosing was 1284 ng/mL or about 2.3 μM which is 15x
that of the IC50 of inhibiting the SH-SY5Y cell growth,
in vitro (Figure 2A and Table 1).
The tissue concentration of X-396 was also
examined in these mice. It clearly indicated that the
X-396 concentrations were higher in the tumor site than
in the plasma in each schedule of treatment performed,
reaching 32 fold-ratio increase 8 h after the last treatment
with 50 mg/kg BID (Table 2). Since the plasma and
tumor concentrations of X-396 are well above the IC50 of
inhibiting cell growth, we expected that X-396 should be
able to inhibit tumor growth.
Indeed, X-396 was able to significantly reduce the
tumor volume in a subcutaneous SH-SY5Y NB model in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B) and its efficacy was
more pronounced than that obtained with crizotinib when
administered at the same dose (Figure 2C). These findings
suggest that the same anti-tumor activity may be achieved
by administration of lower doses of X-396 with respect to
crizotinib, in keeping with results obtained in other animal
models by Lovly et al [10].
The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was not
identified with any given regimens and no signs of
adverse effect were observed (i.e. dehydration, severe
weight loss, Supplementary Figure S2) during the
treatment.

Combined anti-tumor activity of X-396 and NBtargeted nanoparticles entrapping siRNA against
orthotopic and pseudometastatic human NB
xenografts
To determine whether the silencing of ALK,
independently of its mutational status, could improve
the anti-tumor efficacy of the ALK-inhibitor X-396, we
decided to introduce our well established NB-targeted
nanoparticles entrapping siRNA for specific ALKknockdown [21, 22] in the treatment schedule.
Seven days after orthotopic implantation of SH-SY5YLuc and LAN-5-Luc-transduced cells, mice were treated for 21
days with 50 mg/kg QD of X-396 or with 1 mg/Kg of targeted
liposomes entrapped siRNA against ALK (TL[ALK-siRNA])
administered either individually or in combination (COMBO).

22 with respect to the control group at T0, TL[ALK-siRNA]

determined a statistically significant decrease of the signal
in both cell lines (Figure 5A and 5C). Noteworthy, the
combination of X-396 plus TL[ALK-siRNA] treatment led to
further significant reduction of ROI signals respect to the single
agents. These results were supported by a significant increase
of the mice life span, as showed in Figure 5B and 5D.
Based on these encouraging results, we decided to
verify whether the increase of X-396 dose to 100 mg/Kg QD
was able to further ameliorate tumor growth in the mice. As
shown in Figure 6, X-396 and TL[ALK-siRNA] used alone
induced a statistically significant increase of mice life span

Noteworthy, the combination of X-396 plus

DISCUSSION

The use of ALK kinase inhibitors have been shown
to be promising in treatment of Non-Small-Cell Lung
Cancer (NSCLC), Anaplastic Large Lymphoma (ALL)
and other cancers with an ALK-driven component, and for
these reasons novel small-molecule inhibitors suitable for
clinical applications are in development or in early-phase
trials [29–31].
Furthermore, since ALK expression in normal adult
tissues is found in very low levels, selective ALK inhibitors
would exhibit sufficiently wide therapeutic windows in
patients with ALK-activated cancers [31]. Thus, ALK
represents a bona fide target and its inhibition is not
predicted to result in undesirable systemic side effects [32].
Crizotinib, the first small-molecule kinase inhibitor,
timely approved by Food and Drug Administration for
the treatment of NSCLC patients (for details see FDAUS website), has limited activity against the various
ALK-mutations identified in children with NB [14]. As

Despite intensive multimodal treatments (i.e.
combination of isotretinoin, myeloablative therapy with
stem-cell rescue and immunotherapy), the outcome of
high-risk NB-patients remain very poor and the 2-years
progression-free survival was improved only by 20% [25].
Since a considerable cohort of children are refractory to
conventional approaches and/or can face relapse [26], new
improved treatment options are needed.
Many studies on familial and sporadic cases with
advanced NB have shown either germline or somatic
activating mutations in the ALK gene as well as amplification
or rearrangements and/or over expression independently of
its genetic status, providing evidence of its pivotal role in NB
oncogenesis, growth and survival [3, 15, 27, 28]. Therefore,
patients presenting with tumors exhibiting ALK aberrations,
may potentially benefit from ALK-targeted therapy.

observed with other kinase inhibitors, ALK-positive
NSCLC patients eventually relapse on crizotinib. Several
distinct mechanisms of crizotinib resistance have been
identified but most of them as yet remain unknown and
to be elucidated [33–37]. The crizotinib-resistance of NB
cells with ALKF1174L mutation should be surmountable with
very high doses of the drug and/or with new generation
of inhibitors [20]. Importantly, ALKF1174L may secondarily
arise as a mechanism of resistance after an initial response
to crizotinib in patients with ALK-rearranged cancers [16].
Recently, Xcovery developed X-396, a secondgeneration highly specific ALK small molecule tyrosine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

kinase inhibitor. X-396 has proved to be more selective and
up to 10 times more potent than crizotinib in NSCLC [10].
Preliminary clinical results showed that X-396 had efficacy in
crizotinib resistant patients [19]. Accordingly, in the present
study, X-396 proved to be more effective in inhibiting in vitro
NB cell growth than crizotinib (IC50 2.6- 3.7 fold lower).
Importantly, we confirmed and extended the ability
of X-396 to inhibit ALK phosphorylation in NB cell lines
harbouring the two most common ALK mutations, F1174L
and R1275Q [10]. Indeed, one of the most recent study
undertaken in 1,596 diagnosed NB patients identified 8%
mutations at three “hot spot” mutation sites that display

by ALK-siRNA nanoliposomal formulation in combination
with the pharmacological inhibition of the ALK kinase
activity by X-396.
Although ALK mutations are found in a small
percentage of neuroblastomas, other ALK activating
aberrations may occur at genomic, or post-transcriptional or
post-translational level (gene amplification, over expression,
epigenetic regulation, phosphorylation). Therefore, the ALK
role in the activation of downstream pathways involved in
the tumorigenesis of NB might be far greater than expected.
We think that our data suggest that novel small
molecule ALK inhibitors combined with RNA interferingbased nanoliposomes could ultimately subdue many ALKdriven cancers into manageable diseases.

the highest oncogenic potential in NB cells and account
for 85% of mutations (R1275 43%, F1174 30%, and
F1245 12%) [8], the most common of which, F1174L and
R1275Q (73%), are present in some NB cell lines such as
SH-SY5Y and LAN-5 that we have chosen for therapeutic
approaches in vivo of the present study
Pharmacokinetic profiles performed in nude mice
indicated that X-396 is slowly absorbed in vivo as indicated
by TMAX value of 2 h, followed by a moderate terminal
plasma elimination half-life, thus indicate a favourable
behaviour for clinical translation. The plasma and tumor
concentrations were well above the IC50 required to inhibit
the NB cell growth even at the low doses of 25 mg/kg or
50 mg/kg, but higher dose of 100 mg/kg is required to
reach high enough concentration in the brain to achieve
prolonged inhibition, if brain metastases were present.
However, the determination of the brain concentration is
mainly relevant from a toxicology perspective.
The development of acquired resistance to targeted
therapies is considered a largely inevitable hurdle that
has a substantial impact on patients [15, 38]. At least one
mechanism of acquired resistance is the emergence of new
ALK mutations at relapse of NB [27]. Therefore, alternative
strategies that may overcome acquired resistance to
therapeutic agents and increase the efficacy of small molecule
inhibitors in ALK-mutated NB, are of particular relevance.
One promising strategy could be the combination of kinase
inhibitors with gene-specific silencing molecules, such as
siRNAs, which are able to knockdown ALK independently
of its mutational status by promoting degradation of the gene
mRNA. In this context, we have recently generated targeted
nanoliposomal formulations carrying ALK-directed siRNAs
(TL[ALK-siRNA]), which are highly specific for the gene
target [21, 22] and efficiently delivered to NB cells thanks to
a selective tumor targeting provided by the carrier [24, 39].
Indeed, compared to free ALK-siRNA, TL[ALKsiRNA] formulations have low plasma clearance,
increased siRNA stability, improved binding to NB cells,
and are effective for ALK-silencing and induction of
NB cell death [22]. Our liposomal formulation showed
a strong ALK knockdown in mice-bearing NB tumors,
which resulted in cell growth inhibition and prolonged
survival, as described [21].
In the current study, we sought to combine the
TL[ALK-siRNA] with the novel ALK-inhibitor X-396
showing, for the first time to our knowledge, that this drug
combination exhibits a greater anti-tumor effectiveness in
biologically and clinically relevant NB mouse models when
compared with the single agents. Moreover, the combined
treatment was also proven to be well tolerated, with no
obvious toxicities (i.e. weight loss, skin rush), further
underlining a potentially promising therapeutic translation.
In summary, this study provides solid evidence that
a more sensitive and specific therapeutic approach for NB
may be achieved by blocking the ALK signaling pathway
simultaneously through the directed ALK gene knockdown

Cell lines and culture conditions

Pharmacokinetic and therapeutic studies in
subcutaneous NB model

Two human Neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines carrying
different ALK-mutations, SH-SY5Y (ALKF1174L) and
LAN-5 (ALKR1275Q), were grown in Dulbecco’s-modifiedEM and RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma), respectively
[21, 22]. Moreover, cells were tested for mycoplasma
contamination, cell proliferation, morphology evaluation,
and multiplex short tandem repeat profiling test, both after
thawing and within six passages in culture.

Six-week-old male Balb/c nude mice (Beijing
HFK Bio-Technology co. Ltd, Beijing, China) were
subcutaneously injected with 4 × 106 SH-SY5Y cells in
matrigel. Once tumors reached an average volume of 250
mm3, 24 mice were randomly splitted in three groups and
treated via oral gavage (OG) with either 25 or 50 mg/Kg of
X-396 administered bis in die (BID) or 100 mg/kg of X-396
administered quaque die (QD) for 14 days. A uniform
volume per administration (200 μL) was used for each
group. Mice were monitored daily throughout the treatment
period for sign of morbidity/mortality. On the last day of
study, 0.1 – 0.2 mL of blood was collected from the X-396
treated mice as follows: 3 mice in each group were bled at
pre-dose, 1, 4 hours post dose, and sacrificed at 4 hours.
Another 3 mice in each group were bled at 0.5, 2,
and 8 hours post-dose, sacrificed at 8 hours. Tumor and
brain tissues were explanted. Drug concentrations in
plasma and tissues were analyzed by Liquid Chromato­
graphy-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS [10].
In other set of experiments, Balb/c nude mice were
xenografted with SH-SY5Y cells as earlier. Once tumors
reached an average volume of 250 mm3, mice were
randomized and treated as above or with either X-396
or crizotinib via OG, with 50 mg/Kg BID, or control
vehicle. Tumors were measured twice weekly using
callipers, and volume was calculated using the formula:
Length × Width2 × 0.5. Body weight was also assessed
twice weekly. The experiment was terminated after 3
weeks of treatment.
All studies were done in accordance with the current
International Conference on Harmonization harmonized
tripartite guidelines, and the protocol was approved by
the Sundia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(Shangai, China).

Cell proliferation and cell viability assay
NB cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates (at 1
× 103 – 8 × 103 cells per well) in complete medium and
cultured for 24 hours. The medium was removed and
replaced with fresh complete medium supplemented
with four different concentrations of crizotinib or X-396
(10 – 2000 nM) or 0.01% DMSO (control). Six replicates
of cells for each condition were then incubated for an
additional 72 hours. Eighteen hours before the end of the
treatment cells were then incubated with 0.5 μCi (0.0185
MBq) of 3H-thymidine (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Ma, USA)
and processed for liquid scintillation counting (Packard
Instruments Company, Downers Grove, IL) [40, 41].
For viability assay, two hours before the end of
the treatment cells were incubated with AlamarBlue
staining according to the manufacture’s instructions (Life
Technologies).

Western blot analysis
NB cell lines were plated in 10 cm2-dishes and 24
hours after were treated with four different concentrations
of crizotinib or X-396 (10 – 1000 nM) or 0.01% DMSO
(Control) for in total 72 hours.
Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by
western blot analysis [40, 42]. Briefly, cells lines were
lysed with Cell Extraction Buffer (Life Technologies) plus
protease-inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Protein lysates (50
μg per lane) were resolved on sodium dodecyl sulphate
(SDS) 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then incubated
with antibodies against ALK and phospho-ALK tyrosine
1586 (Cat N°3333 and 3343 respectively, Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA). Peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were used as
secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Immune
complexes were visualized with the use of a Supersignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo-Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) or Clarity Western ECL Substrate
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) according to the

Preparation of Targeted Liposomes [ALKsiRNA]
Briefly, ALK-directed siRNA were complexed with
cationic lipids and then coated with neutral lipids [22].
Successively, Fab’ fragment of anti-GD2 monoclonal
antibody was coupled to the malemide terminus of
DSPE-PEG2000-MAL of the liposomes [24] to provide a
formulation of Targeted Liposomes entrapping siRNA
against ALK (TL[ALK-siRNA]). Liposomes size,
polidispersity, and zeta-potential were analysed by
dynamic light scattering using zeta-sizer Nano-S ZS90
particle sizer at a fixed angle (90°) (Malvern Instruments,
Malvern UK).

In vivo therapeutic studies in orthotopic and
pseudometastic NB mouse models

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean values with 95%
confidence intervals. All in vitro data are from at least three
independent experiments. The statistical significance of
differential findings between experimental and control groups
was determined by Student’s t test with Welch’s correction
or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the
Tukey’s or with the Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test.
IC50 values were evaluated by non-linear regression (curvefit: log inhibitor vs normalized response-variable slope)
and significance between slopes were evaluated by linear
regression, Best-fit values and Spearman r (two-tailed) in
GraphPad Prism 5.03 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La
Jolla, CA). These findings were considered significant if twotailed P values were < 0.05.
All in vivo experiments were repeated at least two
times with similar results. Kaplan-Meier method & Log
Rank (Mantel-Cox) test was applied to build up and
compare the survival curves between analyzed groups.

All experiments involving these models have
been reviewed and approved by the licensing and ethical
committee of the IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria
San Martino-IST Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul
Cancro, Genoa, Italy and by Italian Ministry of Health.
All the in vivo experiments were performed using the least
number possible in accordance with the 3 Rs policy.
In the orthotopic-model, NB cells (1.5 × 106 LAN5 or SH-SY5Y) were injected in the left adrenal gland
capsule of five-week-old female athymic (nu/nu) mice
(Harlan Italy, S. Pietro al Natisone, Udine, Italy) [23, 43].
No mice died as result of this treatment.
In the pseudometastatic model, 3 × 106 SH-SY5Y cells
were injected intravenously (i.v.) in the tail vein in four-weekold female nu/nu mice [24, 44]. Mice were then randomly
assigned to the different groups and treated with either the
vehicle alone (control mice) or with X-396 and/or TL[ALKsiRNA] (administered individually or in combination).
Depending on the experimental schedules, mice received 50
or 100 mg/Kg of X-396 via oral gavage QD. An amount of 1
mg/Kg (20 μg/injection per mouse) of TL[ALK-siRNA] were
i.v. injected twice a week, for a total of 3 weeks treatment,
with a 3-day interval between injections.
Body weight and general physical status of the
animals were recorded daily until they were judged to
be in discomfort by animal caretakers. Specifically, once
showing signs of poor health (i.e., abdominal dilatation,
dehydration, paraplegia, severe weight loss), mice were
euthanized by anaesthesia with xilezine (Xilor 2%, Bio98
Srl, Milan, Italy).

A Bioluminescence Imaging System (BLI), able
to capture signals released by Luciferase (Luc)-stablytransduced NB cells [45, 46], named SH-SY5Y-Luc and
LAN-5-Luc, was used to monitor disease progression,
metastasis and therapeutic effects in orthotopic-xenografted
mice. Briefly, SH-SY5Y-Luc and LAN-5-Luc tumor cells,
were orthotopically implanted into the left adrenal gland
of nu/nu mice [45, 47]. The initial in vivo trafficking of
the malignant cells, organ-specific homing, orthotopic
expansion over time, and response to X-396 treatment were
all readily visualized and quantified by a highly sensitive,
cooled Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera mounted
in a light-tight specimen box (IVIS Caliper Life Sciences,
Hopkinton, MA) after 10 min incubation with 150 μg/mL
of D-Luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences) [45].
Quantification of the in vivo Luciferase signal of the
tumor area, expressed as fold increase of photon counts
over time in the Region Of Interest (ROI), was computed
at time 22 and 29 day with respect to the starting day of
the treatment (T0).
