BACKGROUND: The authors hypothesized that low doses of the hypomethylating agent 5-azacitidine may
maximize the graft-versus-leukemia effect and may be tolerated well after allogeneic transplantation
(HSCT). METHODS: The drug was given to 17 patients with acute leukemia as salvage for disease recurrence after HSCT (n ¼ 9 patients) or as maintenance therapy (n ¼ 8 patients). 5-Azacitidine was given subcutaneously daily for 5 days and was repeated every 4 weeks at doses of 16 mg/m2 (n ¼ 4 patients), 24
mg/m2 (n ¼ 9 patients), and 40 mg/m2 (n ¼ 4 patients). A median of 8 cycles was delivered. The median
follow-up was 16 months and 11 months after HSCT and 5-azacitidine treatment, respectively. RESULTS:
Five of 9 patients with recurrent disease responded. Four of 13 responding patients developed disease recurrence while they were receiving 5-azacitidine after a median of 10 months. The actuarial 1-year eventfree and overall survival rates were 55% and 90%, respectively. There were no extramedullary toxicities, and
no graft-versus-host disease exacerbation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose 5-azacitidine
may induce durable remissions for patients who develop disease recurrence after HSCT. Further follow-up
and a larger group of patients will be necessary to confirm these observations. Cancer 2009;115:1899–905.

KEY WORDS: acute leukemia, transplantation, azacitidine, survival.

Disease recurrence is a major cause of treatment failure in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to treat recurrent and/or refractory disease.1,2 Modifications of the preparative regimen
using multiple combinations of chemotherapy and physical agents have failed to reduce the risk of recurrence without an increase in nonrecurrence mortality.3,4 Outcomes after early recurrence of acute leukemia
usually are dismal given the toxicity of salvage chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusions, and second
transplants. Therefore, novel strategies are needed to prevent and treat disease recurrence.
5-Azacidine is a DNA hypomethylating agent that appears to induce leukemic cell differentiation
and increase the expression of human leukemic antigen DR-1 (HLA-DR) and several tumor-associated

antigens. We have hypothesized that such actions may
increase the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect.5-12 The
drug also has significant activity in MDS and AML.13-15 It
is interesting to note that lower doses appear to promote
hypomethylation more effectively than higher doses.16
Lower doses are likely to be tolerated better after HSCT
given the high risk of myelosuppression and other toxicities
in the post-HSCT period. Therefore, we used 5-azacitidine
to treat and prevent disease recurrence after HSCT, and
here we present the results of this intervention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between November 2004 and January 2008, 17 patients
were treated sequentially (16 patients at the University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and 1 patient at
Vanderbilt University). They represent all patients who
received azacitidine in our institutions outside a clinical
trial. Nine patients with AML received 5-azacydine as salvage therapy, and 8 patients (7 with myeloid leukemia
and 1 with lymphoid leukemia) received it as maintenance
of remission. Patients with disease recurrence were chosen
on the basis of having an ‘‘indolent’’ disease recurrence,
whereas maintenance was offered to patients who were
perceived to have a very high risk of disease recurrence but
were in remission after transplantation, as described in
Table 1. In addition, patients did not have uncontrolled
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), elevated liver function
tests, or creatinine levels above the normal range. The
drug was given 5 times daily and was repeated every 4
weeks at doses of 16 mg/m2 (n ¼ 4 patients), 24 mg/m2
(n ¼ 9 patients), and 40 mg/m2 (n ¼ 4 patients). The
intent was to administer azacitidine until loss of response
or upon completion of 2 years of therapy. Doses were chosen on the basis of an ongoing dose-finding study in which
these patients did not participate (either they were not eligible or the protocol was not available in the institution).
Donors were HLA-compatible related (n ¼ 5
donors), unrelated (n ¼ 11 donors; double cord blood,
n ¼ 2 donors), or syngeneic (n ¼ 1 donor). HLA typing
consisted of allele level resolution for HLA-A, HLA-B,
HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1, except for cord
blood donor-recipient pairs, in which the donor was typed
with intermediate resolution for HLA-A and HLA-B and
with high-resolution for HLA-DRB1. All donor-recipient
pairs were fully matched except for recipients of cord
1900

blood transplantation, who received units with 2 mismatches. GVHD prophylaxis was tacrolimus-based in all
patients, and all recipients of unrelated stem cell transplantation received antithymocyte globulin as part of the
conditioning regimen. Patients who were receiving azacitidine also received granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) intermittently at the discretion of the treating
physician for those with absolute neutrophil counts
<1  109/L. No G-CSF was given during administration
of the drug. Toxicity was graded according to National
Cancer Institute criteria. GVHD was graded according to
consensus criteria.17 Bone marrow aspirations were performed 30 days after transplantation and approximately
every 3 months thereafter. Chimerism was studied in
bone marrow and peripheral blood samples obtained at
approximately 3-month intervals using cytogenetics for
sex-mismatched donor-recipient pairs (bone marrow) or
analysis of microsatellite DNA polymorphism (bone marrow and peripheral blood; in the latter, we also analyzed
lymphoid and myeloid chimerism). A complete remission
(CR) was defined as bone marrow with <6% blasts, granulocyte count >1  109/L, and platelet count
>100  109/L. Patients who met these criteria but had
from 6% to 25% bone marrow blasts were considered to
have a partial remission (PR). Event-free survival (EFS)
was measured from start of 5-azacitidine until loss of
response, progression, or death from any cause during
treatment. Overall survival (OS) was defined from the date
of HSCT to the date of death or last follow-up. Survival
probabilities were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier
method and were compared using the log-rank test.18
Informed consent was obtained for 5-azacitidine treatment
in all patients for treatment off protocol. The institutional
review board of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center approved this retrospective study.

RESULTS
The median patient age was 48 years (range, 21-67 years).
Cytogenetics were low-risk, intermediate-risk, and highrisk in 1 patient (5%), 11 patients (65%), and 5 patients
(30%), respectively. Six patients (35%) had failed a previous HSCT. At the time of HSCT, 10 patients (59%) had
refractory disease with a median bone marrow blast percentage of 51% (range, 20%-98%) (Table 1). All 17
patients were in CR after HSCT. Nine patients then

developed a disease recurrence after a median of 8 months
(range, 2-23 months).
5-Azacidine was started at a median of 8 months
(range, 2-26 months) after HSCT in patients with recurrent disease and at a median of 2 months (range, 1-6
months) when it was given as maintenance therapy. The
median number of cycles delivered was 8 (range, 1-22
cycles delivered). Of the 9 patients who had recurrent disease, 6 patients had a medullary recurrence (median bone
marrow blasts, 25%), and 3 patients had extramedullary
disease (leukemia cutis in 2 patients and blastic pleural
effusion in 1 patient). Five of 9 patients who developed
recurrent disease responded (55%); 3 patients achieved a
CR that was ongoing for 4 months and 17 months in
2 patients and that was lost after 4 months in 1 patient
(Table 2). Two patients had a PR that was sustained for
2 months and 4 months. Eight patients who received
5-azacitidine as maintenance therapy remained in CR for
a median of 17 months (range, from 14 months to 26
months). Three of those patients developed disease recurrence after 4 months, 14 months, and 18 months of therapy after they received 3 cycles, 12 cycles, and 12 cycles,
respectively. All but 1 patient in the maintenance group
were full donor chimeras at the beginning of azacitidine
therapy and remained complete chimeras unless they
developed a recurrence. The patient who was a mixed chimera in an unfractionated bone marrow sample became a
complete donor chimera after therapy. Among the
patients with recurrent disease, those who achieved a CR
with azacitidine converted to full donor chimerism in the
lymphoid and myeloid populations.
Five of 9 patients in the recurrent disease subgroup
were off immunosuppressants at the time of disease recurrence, whereas 2 patients underwent immunosuppression
withdrawal to treat recurrence (before initiation of the
drug); and, in 2 patients, azacitidine was given concomitantly with the process of tacrolimus discontinuation. Ten
patients developed grade 1/2 GVHD post-HSCT (before
the initiation of 5-azacitidine); 4 of them had persistent
grade 1/2 GVHD after the initiation of 5-azacitidine, and
no new episodes occurred afterward.
Azacitidine was tolerated well with no extramedullary toxicities and with no apparent increase in the rate of
infectious complications. Grade 1/2 hematologic toxicities were noted in most patients. After a median followup of 16 months (range, 3-40 months) and 11 months
1902

(range, 1-26 months) after HSCT and 5-azacitidine therapy, respectively, 14 patients (82%) remained alive,
including 7 patients (41%) who were in CR and 2 patients
(13%) who were in PR for a median of 20 months (range,
from 7 months to 40 months) and 12 months (range,
from 2 months to 26 months), respectively. The 1and 2-year actuarial EFS and OS rates were 55% and
30%, and 90% and 80%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficacy of
5-azacitidine given to a large number of patients after allogeneic HSCT. Specifically, we demonstrated the safety of
the drug administered at low doses and the lack of
GVHD exacerbation. The efficacy of this approach is suggested by the high response rate in patients with recurrent
disease who had failed after 1 or 2 HSCTs.
The most important predictor of survival for
patients who develop disease recurrence after allogeneic
HSCT is the duration of remission after transplantation.1,2,12,19-21 Our cohort had a short median CR duration of 8 months, and 6 patients had undergone 2
transplantations. Patients who received maintenance therapy were unlikely to remain in CR otherwise given the
advanced stage of their disease at the time they underwent
HSCT.
To our knowledge, there is little information on the
use of 5-azacytidine at the doses that we used in the current study. However, there is clinical and laboratory evidence that the other US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved hypomethylating agent, decitabine, may
be more active in lower than ‘‘standard’’ doses. The FDAapproved dose of 5-azacytidine is 75 mg/m2 daily for 7
days, a dose that is unlikely to be tolerated in the postHSCT period because of high likelihood of myelosuppression and other toxicities.14-16
Immunosuppression withdrawal alone was not responsible for the results described here. In our previous
experience treating similarly high-risk patients, the
response rate to that intervention was zero.22 In addition,
some of our patients remained on immunosuppressants
while they were on azacitidine, although we have avoided
administering the drug in the presence of more than minimal manifestations of GVHD. The response rate observed
in the current study was comparable to that achieved any

salvage strategy used in similar patient populations in the
past with a very favorable toxicity profile.23 It is interesting to note that some patients never achieved a CR but
remained with stable disease for a period. In addition, all
treatments were conducted in the outpatient setting. Most
responders, however, had relatively indolent recurrences,
whereas rapidly evolving disease was less likely to respond.
It is unclear whether the drug has an inhibitory effect on
GVHD, although there is preclinical evidence of its influence on regulatory T lymphocytes.24,25
Our cohort demonstrated that low-dose azacitidine
can be given safely after allogeneic transplantation. We
hypothesize that our results were caused by an effect of
the drug as an antileukemic agent and as a potentiator of
the GVL effect. Although this speculation remains to be
proven formally, low-dose azacitidine may provide us
with a tool with which to decrease the rates of disease recurrence and to improve mixed chimerism after HSCT
when it is given as maintenance or possibly as an adjuvant to donor lymphocyte infusions to treat disease recurrence. We are concluding a dose and schedule finding
study that will be followed by a controlled, randomized
evaluation of azacitidine as maintenance therapy after
HSCT for patients who are at high risk of a recurrence of
AML and MDS.26
