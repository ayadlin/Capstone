Abstract

Author Manuscript

Homologous recombination is a high-fidelity DNA repair pathway. Besides a critical role in
accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, recombination functions in DNA repair and in
the recovery of stalled or broken replication forks to ensure genomic stability. In contrast,
inappropriate recombination contributes to genomic instability, leading to loss of heterozygosity,
chromosome rearrangements, and cell death. The RecA/UvsX/RadA/Rad51 family of proteins
catalyzes the signature reactions of recombination, homology search and DNA strand invasion 1,2.
Eukaryotes also possess Rad51 paralogs, whose exact role in recombination remains to be
defined 3. Here we show that the budding yeast Rad51 paralogs, the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer,
counteract the anti-recombination activity of the Srs2 helicase. Rad55-Rad57 associate with the
Rad51-ssDNA filament, rendering it more stable than a nucleoprotein filament containing Rad51
alone. The Rad51/Rad55-Rad57 co-filament resists disruption by the Srs2 anti-recombinase by
blocking Srs2 translocation involving a direct protein interaction between Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2.
Our results demonstrate an unexpected role of the Rad51 paralogs in stabilizing the Rad51
filament against a biologically important antagonist, the Srs2 anti-recombination helicase. The
biological significance of this mechanism is indicated by a complete suppression of the ionizing
radiation sensitivity of rad55 or rad57 mutants by concomitant deletion of SRS2, as expected for
biological antagonists. We propose that the Rad51 presynaptic filament is a meta-stable reversible
intermediate, whose assembly and disassembly is governed by the balance between Rad55-Rad57
and Srs2, providing a key regulatory mechanism controlling the initiation of homologous

Rad51 protein and its homologs RecA, UvsX, and RadA form nucleoprotein filaments with
ssDNA that perform homology search and DNA strand invasion during homologous
recombination. The Rad51 paralogs share the RecA core with the Rad51 protein featuring
unique N- and C-terminal extensions (Supplementary Fig. 2), but themselves do not form
filaments and are unable to perform homology search and DNA strand invasion 2-4. While
humans contain five paralogs (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, XRCC3), the
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two clearly identifiable paralogs, Rad55
and Rad57 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Rad55 and Rad57 in yeast as well as the five human
RAD51 paralogs have unique non-redundant functions in recombination, and mutations in
any one of them lead to recombination defects, chromosomal instability, sensitivity to DNA
damage, and meiotic defects 1-3. Defects in the budding yeast RAD55 and RAD57 genes lead
to identical and epistatic phenotypes in DNA repair and recombination, consistent with the
formation of a stable Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer 4,5. Rad55-Rad57 were inferred to function
as mediator proteins (ref. 6) allowing assembly of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament on
ssDNA covered by the eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein RPA 4. This suggested that
Rad55-Rad57 are involved in the nucleation of the Rad51 filament, which is otherwise
inhibited on RPA-covered ssDNA. This nucleation model is akin to the role of RecFOR or
BRCA2 in nucleating RecA or human RAD51 filaments 7-9. Rad51 filament formation in
vivo can be monitored cytologically as Rad51 focus formation at the site of DNA damage 10.
Unexpectedly, Rad51 focus formation after IR in yeast was demonstrated to be independent
of Rad55-Rad57 and formation of visible Rad55-Rad57 foci required Rad51 10. These
results are difficult to reconcile with the nucleation model derived from the biochemical
results and suggest an alternative function of Rad55-Rad57 in vivo.

To address the function of the Rad51 paralogs in yeast, we determined the effect of Rad55Rad57 on the stability of Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein complexes. Deletion mutants of the
RAD55 or RAD57 genes display a curious enhancement of some phenotypes at low
temperature (in particular IR sensitivity; see Supplementary Fig. 12) 5, suggesting that these
proteins are involved in the stabilization of a molecular complex, likely the Rad51
presynaptic filament. To test this hypothesis, we incubated subsaturating amounts of Rad51
protein with ssDNA (1 Rad51 per 15 nts) in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of
Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer (1 Rad55-Rad57 per 4 Rad51) and challenged the filaments with
buffer containing high salt (500 mM NaCl) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Under these
conditions, Rad51 does not maintain stable complexes with ssDNA during electrophoresis.
However, the presence of Rad55-Rad57 resulted in stable, Rad51-containing ssDNA
complexes that withstood the salt challenge. In a complementary approach, we examined the
effect of Rad55-Rad57 on Rad51 filament formation at near physiological ionic strength (90
mM NaCl) (Fig. 1a, b). Under these conditions, only a fraction of the available Rad51 binds
ssDNA, causing retarded mobility of the DNA (Fig. 1b, lane 3). Addition of
substoichiometric amounts of Rad55-Rad57 (1 Rad55-Rad57 per 6 Rad51 in lane 4 of Fig.
1b) led to the formation of a novel, supershifted complex that contained both Rad51 and
Rad55-Rad57, as demonstrated by immunoblotting. Rad55-Rad57 alone binds to DNA

under these conditions, leading to the formation of protein-networks that are too large to
enter the gel (Fig. 1b, lane 2). The results from both experiments (Fig. 1b; Supplementary
Fig. 3) suggest that Rad55-Rad57 form a co-complex with Rad51 on ssDNA and stabilize
Rad51-ssDNA filaments. Indeed, immunogold electron microscopy (EM) targeted towards
Rad55 (GST-tag; see Fig. 1c) directly visualized Rad55 associated with the Rad51-ssDNA
filaments (Fig. 1d). Control experiments demonstrated the specificity of the gold labeling
(Supplementary Table 1) with over 90% of the gold particles associated with clearly
identifiable Rad51 filaments. The remainder may have associated with filaments too short to
be scored or with free Rad55-Rad57. Gold particles were found either at the filament
terminus (n=40) or interstitially (n=43) (Supplementary Table 1). Negative controls with
Rad51 filaments assembled in the absence of Rad55-Rad57 showed negligible gold labeling
(Supplementary Table 1). These data show that Rad55-Rad57 are associated with the
Rad51-ssDNA filament, but the exact disposition of the heterodimer with the filament
remains to be determined (see Fig. 1e).

Salt stability of protein-DNA complexes is a valuable biochemical criterion. To establish
biological significance, we tested whether Rad55-Rad57 stabilize Rad51-ssDNA filaments
against a biologically relevant destabilizer. The Srs2 helicase was identified as a negative
regulator of homologous recombination, and genetic experiments suggested that Srs2 targets
Rad51 protein 11-13. Consistent with the genetic data, Srs2 translocates on ssDNA and
disrupts Rad51 presynaptic filaments in vitro, providing a compelling mechanism for its
function as an anti-recombinase 14-16. In the presence of 0.1 or 0.33 μM Srs2 approximately
70% of the Rad51 is dissociated as assessed by measuring Rad51 associated with ssDNA
coupled to magnetic beads (Fig. 2a- c). The presence of substochiometric amounts of
Rad55-Rad57 (0.1 μM) enhanced the recovery of ssDNA-bound Rad51 by ∼2-fold (from
31% to 60% in the presence of 333 nM Srs2). Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2 bound to Rad51covered ssDNA in a quantitative and concomitant manner (Fig. 2d). Together the data show
that Rad55-Rad57 inhibit Srs2 when bound to DNA and not in solution. Concentrationdependent inhibition of Srs2-mediated dissociation of Rad51 from ssDNA by Rad55-Rad57
was also observed in a topology-based assay (Supplementary Fig. 4, 5).

To further investigate the role of Rad55-Rad57 in antagonizing disruption of Rad51
presynaptic filaments by Srs2, we utilized EM to examine nucleoprotein filaments directly
(Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 6). Rad51 filaments were assembled on a 600 nt fragment of
ssDNA and RPA was added to visualize free ssDNA. Consistent with previous
observations 14,15, in the absence of Rad55-Rad57 Srs2 disrupts the Rad51-ssDNA filament
efficiently, leading to binding of RPA to the newly exposed ssDNA (Fig. 3). Importantly,
when sub-stoichiometric amounts of Rad55-Rad57 were co-incubated with Rad51 and
ssDNA, the filaments were stabilized against disruption by Srs2, as indicated by the
significantly increased mean filament length.
How do Rad55-Rad57 block Srs2 from dissociating Rad51 from ssDNA? Srs2 is known to
interact with Rad51 and trigger the Rad51 ATPase leading to dissociation of Rad51 from
ssDNA 16. We found that Rad55-Rad57 form a 1:1 complex with Srs2 (Fig. 4a) and have
higher affinity to Srs2 than to Rad51 (Fig. 4b, c). Excess Rad51 does not compete with Srs2
binding to Rad55-Rad57 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Moreover, Rad55-Rad57 are able to

simultaneously bind Rad51 and Srs2 in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Figs.
7-9). We entertained the possibility that Rad55-Rad57 inhibit the Srs2 ATPase activity and
by that Srs2 translocation, but Srs2 ATPase activity is barely altered by the presence of
Rad55-Rad57 (data not shown). Srs2 translocase/helicase activity is stimulated by Rad51
binding to DNA 17 (Fig. 4e-g). Importantly, Rad55-Rad57 completely suppress this
stimulatory effect of Rad51, leading to inhibition of the Srs2 helicase activity even at a 5fold molar excess of Srs2 over Rad55-Rad57 (Fig. 4f, g; Supplementary Fig. 10). This
substoichiometric action of Rad55-Rad57 eliminates the possibility that Rad55-Rad57
inhibition functions by binding Srs2 in solution. Rad55-Rad57 only slightly inhibit Srs2
helicase in the absence of Rad51 (Fig. 4g; Supplementary Fig. 10c). Control experiments
show that this effect depends on Srs2 translocating in the expected 3′ to 5′ direction
(Supplementary Fig. 10d), showing that Rad55-Rad57 inhibit Srs2 translocation on DNA to
increase filament stability (Figs. 1, 2) and function (Supplementary Fig. 11). Direct
visualization of human RAD51 filaments revealed that RAD51 is only able to form
discontinuous short clusters on dsDNA, as a result of frequent nucleation but limited
extension 18,19. If this property holds true for ssDNA, the formation of a co-filament with
Rad51 by Rad55-Rad57 might provide a mechanism to form extended Rad51 filaments.
This could also explain the increase in Rad55-Rad57 focus intensity over time in following
IR exposure and is consistent with the dependence of Rad55-Rad57 foci on Rad51 10.

Our biochemical data are consistent with a model (Supplementary Fig. 1) whereby Rad51
presynaptic filament formation is modulated by a balance between the stabilizing function of
Rad55-Rad57 and the destabilizing function of Srs2 anti-recombinase. This model predicts
that a deletion of SRS2 should suppress the phenotypes caused by defects in Rad55-Rad57.
In fact, srs2Δ completely suppresses the IR sensitivity of rad57 and rad55 mutations in
quantitative survival assays (Supplementary Fig. 12), consistent with semi-quantitative
results using rad57 20. However, srs2Δ only mildly suppresses the MMS sensitivity
(Supplementary Fig. 13) and recombination defect (Supplementary Fig. 14) of a rad55
mutation, consistent with previous rad57 data20. The difference in suppression is likely
related to that IR-induced DNA damage requires primarily DSB repair, whereas MMSinduced DNA damage and sister chromatid recombination require gap repair
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We propose that the Rad51 presynaptic filament is a meta-stable
reversible intermediate, whose dynamics in yeast are partially controlled by the balance of
the filament-stabilizing activity of Rad55-Rad57 and the filament-destabilizing activity of
the Srs2 helicase (Supplementary Fig. 1). This balance is likely influenced by the multiple
post-translational modifications that have been identified to regulate Rad55-Rad57 21 and
Srs2 22 functions (Supplementary Fig. 1) (ref. 1). Together with the local availability of
SUMO-PCNA, which specifically recruits Srs2 23-25, post-translational modifications may
determine the balance between recombination and anti-recombination in wild type cells and
explain the various degrees of suppression observed in the srs2 rad55 (rad57) double
mutants that depend on the type of DNA damage or genetic endpoint (DSB versus
replication fork associated gap in Supplementary Fig. 1).
The human RAD51 paralogs play important roles in tumor suppression and human
disease 3,26. Our studies established an unprecedented mechanism of anti-antirecombination

that may serve as a paradigm for the mechanism of action of the five human RAD51
paralogs. The diversification of the human RAD51 paralogs may reflect the multiplicity of
human motor proteins that may disrupt RAD51 presynaptic filaments, including the RecQlike helicases BLM and RECQL5 as well as FBH1 and FANCJ 27-30 or indicate additional
functions during recombinational repair.
