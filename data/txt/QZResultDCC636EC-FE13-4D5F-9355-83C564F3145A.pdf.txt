BACKGROUND: The ICON6 trial showed that cediranib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3,
improved clinical outcomes for patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer when it was used with chemotherapy and
was continued as maintenance therapy. This study describes health-related quality of life (QOL) during the first year of treatment.
METHODS: Four hundred fifty-six women were randomly allocated to receive standard chemotherapy only, chemotherapy with concurrent cediranib, or chemotherapy with cediranib administered concurrently and continued as maintenance. Patients completed
QOL questionnaires until disease progression every 3 weeks during chemotherapy and then every 6 weeks to 1 year. Patients alive
with disease progression completed a QOL form 1 year after randomization. The primary QOL endpoint was the global score from the
Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) at 1 year, with the standard chemotherapy group compared with the concurrent-maintenance cediranib group. RESULTS: The rate of questionnaire compliance was 90% at the baseline and 76% at 1 year and was similar across the 3 groups. The mean global QOL score at 1 year was 62.6
points for the standard chemotherapy group and 68.7 points for the concurrent-maintenance group (14.5; 95% confidence interval, –
2.0 to 11.0; P 5 .18). Sensitivity analyses suggested that this finding was robust to the effect of missing data, and the improvement
became statistically significant after adjustments for self-reported diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The 6th study by the International Collaboration in Ovarian Neoplasm (ICON6) showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival with cediranib as concurrent
and maintenance therapy. No QOL detriment with cediranib was found 1 year after treatment was commenced. The maintenance of
QOL along with prolonged cancer control suggests that cediranib has a valuable role in the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION
The effects of new cancer therapies on patients’ quality of life (QOL) should be assessed alongside their effects on clinical outcomes.1,2 The 6th study by the International Collaboration in Ovarian Neoplasm (ICON6) was a phase 3 trial testing the
addition of cediranib, an angiogenesis inhibitor, to standard platinum-based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis
is an important part of preclinical and clinical cancer growth.3,4 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator
of angiogenesis. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGRs) can prolong survival for patients with
ovarian and other cancers.5 Cediranib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of VEGF signaling
through the VEGR1, VEGR2, and VEGR3 receptors, and it has been studied in the management of several tumors.6-9
All patients in ICON6 had relapsed platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma (subsequently called ovarian cancer). In the reference group (group A), patients received 18 weeks of standard chemotherapy; in the first intervention group (group B), cediranib was added for the duration of the chemotherapy only; and
in the second intervention group (group C), cediranib was given with chemotherapy, and this was followed by maintenance cediranib. Hereafter, the 3 randomized groups are called the reference (group A), concurrent (group B), and maintenance groups (group C). The trial was redesigned by the Trial Management Group after AstraZeneca’s decision to cease

cediranib development. The redesigned trial required fewer patients; the primary endpoint became progression-free
survival instead of overall survival, with the primary comparison made between groups A and C.
Group C had significantly lengthened progressionfree survival in comparison with group A (hazard ratio,
0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.73; log-rank P <
.001).10 Improved overall survival was also seen in group C,
but the difference was not statistically significant (hazard
ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-1.05; P 5 .1),
whereas adverse events, including diarrhea and hypertension, occurred more frequently among patients receiving
cediranib. A health-related QOL assessment provides a
broad evaluation of a patient’s function, well-being, and
symptoms over time. We reported outline QOL data in the
initial article on survival; here, balancing cancer control
against the nature of the time gained and using validated
self-report measures, we report detailed QOL data describing the wider impact on patients.11,12 Previous QOL analyses in large ovarian cancer treatment trials have shed
substantial light on this balance.13-19 We report a QOL substudy, designed at the outset of ICON6, that examined key
a priori hypotheses about the effect of adding cediranib to
standard chemotherapy during the first year of treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ICON6 Parent Study

ICON6 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-group (2:3:3 ratio), multicenter, phase 3
Cancer

July 15, 2017

Gynecological Cancer Intergroup trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding oral cediranib (20 mg
daily; AstraZeneca, United Kingdom) to standard
platinum-based chemotherapy. The recommended chemotherapy was carboplatin dosed to target an area under
the concentration versus time curve of 6 (AUC6) every 3
weeks in combination with paclitaxel (175 mg/m3). Other
platinum-based regimens were allowed if previous toxicity
or fitness prevented combination therapy.
After radiological confirmation of relapsed ovarian
cancer, 456 women were recruited between November
2008 and December 2011. Treatment in each group was
initially planned for 78 weeks (18 months), but a protocol
amendment allowed patients to continue treatment indefinitely if they continued to benefit. Each participant gave
informed consent, and the study was approved by relevant
ethics committees and research governance authorities.
The trial is registered with the International Standard
Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry
(ISRCTN68510403), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00532194),
and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN1261000016003).
ICON6 QOL Substudy
Data collection

Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and
Quality of Life Questionnaire for Ovarian Cancer 28
(QLQ-OV28) from the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer provided QOL estimates within the preceding 7 days. The QLQ-C30
2753

Original Article

contains 30 items, including a global health status scale, 5
function scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and
social), and 9 symptom scales/items (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation,
diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The QLQ-OV28 contains 28 items focused on ovarian cancer, including
abdominal/gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, chemotherapy side effects (not specifically
antiangiogenic-agent side effects), hormonal/menopausal
symptoms, body image, attitude to disease/treatment, and
sexual functioning. For each subscale, the score is scaled
from 0 to 100. For function scales, high scores indicate better function (improved QOL); for symptom scales, higher
scores indicate greater symptoms (poorer QOL). The
QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-OV28 have undergone extensive
psychometric validation and multiple translations and are
acceptable to patients.20 A between-groups difference of 10
to 15 points in the QLQ-C30 global health score was previously defined as having moderate clinical significance.21
Questionnaires were completed during outpatient
attendance at protocol-defined time points (Fig. 1). QOL
data were collected by patient self-report, on paper, without conferral with others, and always before medical consultation or treatment administration. QOL data were
collected only after disease progression at a scheduled
assessment 1 year after enrollment for all patients still
alive. Reasons for missing QOL data at scheduled collection time points were requested.

chemotherapy were compared for group A and
groups B and C combined for patients with ascites at
enrollment.
Mid hypothesis. The improvement in symptoms
will be faster in patients receiving cediranib because
of a more rapid reduction in cancer bulk. The
changes from enrollment to the midpoint of chemotherapy (the start of cycle 4) in the global, physicalfunction, and pain scores of the QLQ-C30 were
compared between group A and groups B and C
combined.
Late hypothesis. Maintenance cediranib may continue social impairment and fatigue. The socialfunctioning and fatigue scales of the QLQ-C30 at 1
year were compared between group C and groups A
and B combined.
Differences between the treatment groups in all other validated subscales of the QLQ-C30 and the QLQOV28 were analyzed individually in an exploratory manner with a significance level of P 5 .01.
Sample size

The sample size of ICON6 was determined clinically to
detect a hazard ratio of 0.65 for progression-free survival
between groups A and C with 2-sided 5% significance
and 80% power. For QOL, this gave us 80% power to
detect a small difference between groups (7 points) in
global QOL, with the standard deviation estimated from
QOL data for the control group of the ICON7 study.

Outcomes

The primary QOL endpoint was the QLQ-C30 global
QOL score 1 year after enrollment. The primary comparison was made between groups A and C, which was consistent with survival endpoints. One year was chosen because
many patients experience good QOL at that point if they
are not receiving chemotherapy and their cancer is controlled. The QOL form closest to 1 year (within 63
months) was used for the primary outcome.
Secondary outcomes included 3 hypotheses based
on cediranib’s mechanism for controlling cancer and causing toxicity and on elements of maintenance cancer therapy that can be important to patients.22 These were
specified a priori to examine the effect of cediranib at different time points during treatment:
Early hypothesis. Angiogenesis is related to ascites
formation; therefore, a more rapid resolution of ascites will be observed in patients receiving cediranib.
With the abdominal/gastrointestinal subscale of the
QLQ-OV28, the areas under the curve during

Statistical methods

Randomization was performed with permuted blocks stratified by the Gynecological Cancer InterGroup group, firstline chemotherapy, duration of relapse-free interval, and
previous use of VEGF inhibitors. The statistical significance of the difference in primary QOL outcomes at 1 year
between randomized groups was assessed with an analysis
of covariance adjusted for the baseline value. Based on
repeated measurements from randomization to 1 year,
mixed-effects regression models were used to analyze
changes in QOL with unstructured covariance and patientlevel random effects. The statistical significance of secondary outcomes was assessed as follows: for the early hypothesis, an analysis of covariance adjusted for the baseline score;
for the mid hypothesis, linear regression modeling of the
interaction between the treatment group and whether or
not the patient was symptomatic at the baseline; and for
the late hypothesis, an analysis of covariance adjusted for
the score at the end of chemotherapy. An analysis of covariance was used to compare exploratory outcomes between

randomized groups and was also used for a subsequent
re-analysis of the primary outcome with adjustments for
diarrhea scores. All analyses were performed with the
intention-to-treat principle with Stata 13.1.
Sensitivity analysis and missing data

To assess the potential impact on the primary outcome of
the relatively wide 3-month visit window, the analysis was
repeated with a 1-month window. To assess the effect of
early disease progression, the analysis was repeated after
the exclusion of patients whose disease had progressed

before 1 year. To assess the effect of patients’ stopping
treatment early after an adverse event, the primary outcome analysis, adjusted for diarrhea scores, was repeated
after the exclusion of these patients.
The potential impact of missing data on the primary
outcome was also assessed; imputation was used to model
a number of scenarios: In scenario 1, a global score of 0
was imputed for patients who died within 1 year of enrollment. In scenarios 2 to 4, all patients alive at 1 year but
missing QOL data were assigned a score; this started with
the mean 1-year score and continued with the mean score

during the maintenance period (Table 2 and Fig. 2).
The mean QOL changes during chemotherapy were
–2.8, –7.4, and –12.0 points in groups A, B, and C,
respectively. During maintenance, the mean QOL was
reduced further by –1.0 point in group A but
increased by 5.5 and 2.5 points in groups B and C,
respectively.

minus 10 points and then the mean score minus 20. The
rationale for this approach was that patients with missing
data may be missing because of illness, and in this case, a
lower than average QOL would be expected. In scenarios
5 and 6, control patients alive but missing QOL data were
given the mean 1-year score, whereas maintenance-group
patients were given the mean minus 10 and the then mean
minus 20 to examine how much difference would be
needed to affect the interpretation of results.
RESULTS
All ICON6 participants were included in the QOL substudy (n 5 456). QOL data were expected from 340
women at 1 year; 72 others had died, 37 were lost to
follow-up after disease progression, and 7 were lost to
follow-up without progression. Baseline data were provided by 410 of the 456 women (90%; Table 1), and 1-year
data were provided by 259 of 340 women (76% of those
in follow-up); 235 of these 340 women (69%) had data
for both these time points.
Primary Outcome

The difference in global QOL 1 year after randomization
between patients in groups A and C (the reference and
maintenance groups) was neither clinically nor statistically
significant (Table 2). The mean 1-year scores were 68.7
and 62.6 in groups C and A, respectively; the average
global QOL was 4.5 points higher in group C than group
A (95% confidence interval, –2.0 to 11.0; P 5 .18 after
adjustments for the baseline).
Mixed-effects modeling of repeated global QOL
scores from enrollment to 1 year showed some decline
during chemotherapy followed by an improvement
2756

No significant difference was found between the treatment groups in any of the 3 specific prospectively defined
secondary analyses (Table 3). First, among patients with
ascites at the baseline, abdominal symptom scores were
lower at the end of chemotherapy but by similar amounts
for those receiving cediranib and those not receiving cediranib (A vs B/C: P 5 .98). Second, at the midpoint of chemotherapy treatment, global scores, pain scores, and
physical-function scores were all lower than those at the
baseline but again by similar amounts for those receiving
cediranib and those not receiving cediranib (A vs B/C: P
for global score 5 .88, P for pain score 5 .92, and P for
physical-function score 5 .63). Therefore, even in
patients with angiogenic processes contributing to symptoms, with platinum-sensitive relapsed disease, cediranib
did not improve patients’ reports of symptoms early during treatment. Third, from the end of chemotherapy to 1
year, social-functioning scores changed little, whereas
fatigue scores were reduced similarly among patients
receiving and not receiving maintenance cediranib (A/B
vs C: P for social-functioning score 5 .17 and P for
fatigue score 5 .71).
Exploratory Analysis

The analysis of other subscales of the QLQ-C30 and the
QLQ-OV28 was exploratory. Most differences between
the 3 randomized groups were small and not statistically
significant at the prespecified significance level of P 5 .01
(Supporting Tables 2-4 [see online supporting information]). However, diarrhea was reported more in groups B
and C during chemotherapy and continued in group C
during the maintenance period. At 12 months, the difference between groups was highly significant (P < .001),
diarrhea being reported more by patients in group C than
those in group A or B. We, therefore, re-analyzed the primary outcome of global QOL at 12 months post hoc, and
we adjusted the analysis for self-reported diarrhea. The
results in groups B and C were very similar, with both having significantly better QOL than group A (Table 4).
There was good agreement between self-reported diarrhea
and the clinically reported diarrhea grade (Supporting

Sensitivity Analysis and Missing Data

Sensitivity analyses did not alter our interpretation of
the results. The primary endpoint changed little after the
1-year visit window was reduced from 3 to 1 months and
also after patients whose disease had progressed at 1 year
were excluded. Our interpretation was also unchanged
after the exclusion of patients who stopped treatment after
toxicity, the effect being relatively small after adjustments
for the diarrhea score (Table 4).
The proportion of missing data increased over time
(Table 1). At 1 year, QOL data were sought from all

surviving patients whether or not their disease had
progressed; 81 of 340 forms (24%) were not received (19,
29, and 33 in groups A, B, and C, respectively). The
reason for missing forms was known in 31 cases (38%): in
21 of these 31 cases (68%), administrative oversight by
the center was the reason; in 6 of these 31 cases (19%),
patient refusal not due to illness was the reason; and in 4
of these 31 cases (13%), the patient was too ill. None of
the sensitivity analyses modeling the value of missing data
through 6 scenarios changed the interpretation of our
results (Fig. 3), with the imputation of clinically plausible
values used for missing data.15 Therefore, our primary
finding of no significant decrement in QOL for the cediranib group is robust to the range of clinically plausible unrecorded data with progressive, increasingly
treatment-resistant ovarian cancer.

DISCUSSION
We report QOL results from the ICON6 trial of cediranib for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Comparing patients in the reference arm and patients receiving
maintenance cediranib treatment, our primary analysis
found that global QOL after 1 year was not significantly
different according to the intention to treat. We examined
whether cediranib improved symptoms early in the treatment course, and this was not the case. Among patients
with abdominal symptoms at relapse, the resolution of
symptoms during chemotherapy was unchanged with
cediranib. Halfway through chemotherapy, there was no
difference in pain and physical-function scores with cediranib. At later time points, no difference was seen in social
functioning or fatigue with cediranib
Diarrhea was observed as a significant adverse effect
and continued in the maintenance group. With adjustments for self-reported diarrhea, patients on maintenance
treatment had significantly improved QOL in comparison with the reference group. Therefore, although our primary analysis showed global QOL after 1 year to be
unaffected by cediranib, the data also suggest that cediranib could provide improved QOL if better diarrhea

control could be achieved. This would, however, depend
on the quality of diarrhea control at a population level
outside clinical trials, such as was achieved, for example,
with detailed studies of the physiology of this adverse
effect after irinotecan.23 Our data indicate the incomplete
association between patient reports of diarrhea and clinical severity grading and emphasize the importance of evaluating both aspects of adverse effects.
When the 1-year period was divided into chemotherapy and postchemotherapy phases, the overall picture
was of declining QOL during chemotherapy, with some
recovery from the end of chemotherapy to 1 year. There
was evidence that in patients receiving cediranib (groups
B and C), a greater decline occurred during chemotherapy, but there was also a stronger postchemotherapy recovery. Results in groups B and C were again very similar
when they were adjusted for self-reported diarrhea, and
this indicates further the key nature of diarrhea control to
the experience of cediranib treatment.
ICON6 is the only randomized trial of cediranib for
recurrent ovarian cancer; however, our finding of no
QOL detriment tallies with other trials of antiangiogenic
therapies (Supporting Table 2 [see online supporting

information]), whereas reduced QOL has been reported
with erlotinib (an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor) as maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.24 The negative short-term impact of second-line
chemotherapy plus cediranib contrasts with QOL
improvements observed during first-line chemotherapy
combined with antiangiogenic agents.13,25 Treating
relapsed ovarian cancer before symptom development
has previously been found detrimental to QOL,26
but 87% of ICON6 patients were symptomatic at
randomization.
It is also interesting to note the findings of Stockler
15
et al in a trial of bevacizumab in recurrent ovarian cancer, where differences were primarily in cancer-specific
symptom scores. This raises the important question
whether patient-reported outcomes studies should focus
on cancer-specific symptom control or whether (in recurrent cancer) the overall impact of treatment on patient
function and QOL (balancing toxicity, disruption, and
cancer symptoms) is primary when the clinical value of a
treatment is being considered. Although this is more difficult to improve (because most treatments have negative
aspects), we believe that function and QOL should have
primacy in the assessment of palliative cancer therapies as
equal partners with estimates of cost, cancer control, survival, and toxicity.2,27 Patient-reported outcome instruments need rigorous development to be valid endpoints in

trials, so they will inevitably be available later than clinical
symptom assessments for newer drugs with distinct toxicity patterns. Voice changes with cediranib are an example.
Therefore, functional and global assessments will retain a
key role.28
We studied a large group of women representative of
the patient population making choices about second-line
therapy for ovarian cancer. The pattern of QOL that we
observed, during chemotherapy and afterwards, is consistent
with our expectations, and this indicates that the QLQOV28 and QLQ-C30 instruments are appropriate and sufficiently sensitive for detecting important changes. We
achieved a comprehensive collection of QOL data. Any bias
arising from missing data should be attenuated by similar
levels of missing data across randomized groups. Our sensitivity analyses indicate that our findings are robust to missing data, and this greatly strengthens our interpretation.29,30
However, weaknesses include the limited data (5%)
from women beyond cancer progression. We chose this
design because of patient burden and incomplete contextual data on treatment after relapse. Although sensitivity
analyses support our conclusions, missing data were
replaced with mean values rather than individual multivariate imputation. We used a wide 3-month window to
estimate 1-year QOL because of missing data; this adds
uncertainty, although a sensitivity analysis applying a
1-month window did not change our conclusions.

Original Article

We report no significant difference in global QOL
with cediranib among recurrent ovarian cancer patients
after 1 year, including a period of maintenance treatment,
in comparison with chemotherapy alone. Self-reported
symptom data show that the main toxicity reported by
patients with cediranib is diarrhea, and an additional
exploratory analysis suggests that improved QOL from
the cancer-control effect of cediranib may be achievable if
diarrhea can be better controlled. The primary clinical
analysis of ICON6 reported significantly improved
progression-free survival and a nonsignificant improvement in overall survival. The unchanged QOL should be
considered alongside the improved clinical outcomes by
patients, clinicians, and funding authorities as they consider the case for cediranib as a new therapeutic treatment
option for recurrent ovarian cancer.
