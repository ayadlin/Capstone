ABSTRACT:
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that occur
spontaneously, or from benign plexiform neurofibromas, in the context of the genetic disorder
Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The current standard treatment includes surgical resection,
high-dose chemotherapy, and/or radiation. To date, most targeted therapies have failed to
demonstrate effectiveness against plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs. Recently, several
studies suggested that the mTOR and MAPK pathways are involved in the formation and
progression of MPNSTs. Everolimus (RAD001) inhibits the mTOR and is currently FDA approved
for several types of solid tumors. PD-0325901 (PD-901) inhibits MEK, a component of the MAPK
pathway, and is currently in clinical trials. Here, we show in vitro than MPNST cell lines are
more sensitive to inhibition of cellular growth by Everolimus and PD-901 than immortalized
human Schwann cells. In combination, these drugs synergistically inhibit cell growth and induce
apoptosis. In two genetically engineered mouse models of MPNST formation, modeling both
sporadic and NF1-associated MPNSTs, Everolimus, or PD-901 treatment alone each transiently
reduced tumor burden and size, and extended lifespan. However, prolonged treatment of each
single agent resulted in the development of resistance and reactivation of target pathways.
Combination therapy using Everolimus and PD-901 had synergistic effects on reducing tumor
burden and size, and increased lifespan. Combination therapy allowed persistent and prolonged
reduction in signaling through both pathways. These data suggest that co-targeting mTOR and
MEK may be effective in patients with sporadic or NF1-associated MPNSTs.

INTRODUCTION

loss of NF1 results in increased signaling through the
PI3K pathway, data suggest that additional changes occur
that further activate signaling through this pathway. For
example, many MPNSTs express EGFR, which when
stimulated by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), results
in hyperactivation of PI3K signaling [13]. Loss of Nf1 in
mouse Schwann cells is sufficient for benign neurofibroma
formation, but additional loss of Pten drives malignant
transformation [11, 12]. Additionally, a Sleeping Beauty
forward genetic screen demonstrated that while benign
neurofibromas had insertions in either Nf1 or Pten,
these mutations only co-occurred in MPNSTs [19].
These observations suggest that co-targeting the mTOR
and MAPK pathways may be an effective treatment for
MPNSTs.
Therapies that target PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK
pathways have been of studied both pre-clinically and in
clinical trials for many cancer types [4, 20, 21]. The most
clinically studied are drugs that bind FKBP12, inhibiting
the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway by directly
binding the mTOR Complex1 (mTORC1), not inhibiting
kinase activity directly [22]. These inhibitors of the mTOR
pathway include sirolimus (rapamycin) and its derivative,
Everolimus (RAD001) [22]. Currently, Everolimus is
FDA approved for kidney cancer, subependymal glial cell
astrocytomas, pancreatic cancer and certain subtypes of
breast cancer [23]. There are phase III clinical trials in
progress for gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and
lymphoma [23].
Preclinical studies have been conducted in models
of neurofibromas and MPNSTs using mTOR inhibitors
that suggest varied efficacy at different stages of disease.
In a mouse MPNST model where Nf1 and p53 are deleted
in cis, and in MPNST xenograft studies, rapamycin
treatment resulted in delayed tumor formation [24, 25]. In
contrast, when Nf1 is biallelically inactivated in Schwann
cells and their precursors (Nf1 flox/flox; DhhCre), modeling
grade 1 neurofibromas, Everolimus was ineffective at
decreasing tumor volume [26]. Based on these studies,
phase II clinical trials are currently in progress using the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in the treatment of plexiform
neurofibromas [2].
PD0325901 (PD-901) is a potent and highly specific
allosteric inhibitor of Mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase kinases, MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK) [27]. It is
currently in clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer
and other advanced cancers [28]. In preclinical studies,
PD-901 has shown efficacy in a human MPNST xenograft
model; tumor growth was reduced and survival was
prolonged, although tumor growth was not completely
suppressed [29]. In GEMM-PNSTs in which Nf1 and
Ink4a are biallelically deleted in the sciatic nerve, mice
develop MPNSTs and show a delay in growth when
treated with PD-901 [30]. In the GEMM of neurofibromas
formation (Nf1 flox/flox; DhhCre), PD-901 reduced tumor

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that occur in 10% of
patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), but which
can also occur spontaneously in the general population
[1]. MPNSTs are derived from Schwann cells and/or their
precursors and are highly associated with peripheral nerves
[1]. The current standard of care for patients with MPNSTs
includes surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy and the
only cure for MPNST is complete surgical resection [2].
Unfortunately, MPNSTs are often inoperable, due to
nerve-association and infiltration of surrounding structures
[3]. MPNSTs are also highly aggressive and often chemoand radiation resistant, making these tumors difficult to
treat [4]. Even when surgery in combination with radiation
or chemotherapy is used, the local recurrence rate is 4065%, with distant recurrence occurring 40-68% of the
time. Chemotherapy treatment on distant metastases does
not improve survival rates [5]. With the current treatment
strategies used, the five-year survival rate for patients with
MPNSTs is less than 40% and remains the leading cause
of death for patients with NF1 [2, 6, 7]. Current research
in the field focuses on identifying the genetic changes and
molecular pathways that drive MPNST formation in order
to identify targeted therapies that can be used to treat these
tumors more effectively [3, 6].
In NF1 patients, loss of the Neurofibromin 1 gene
(NF1) is required for benign neurofibroma formation, and
additional genetic changes are required for transformation
into MPNSTs [8]. For example, in chimeric mice with
loss of Nf1, benign, grade 1 neurofibromas will form;
when Tp53 is also lost, these tumors present as highgrade peripheral nerve sheath tumors (GEM-PNST) [9,
10]. When Nf1 is biallelically inactivated in Schwann
cells, GEM-grade 1 neurofibromas occur, but when
phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) is also lost,
these mice form numerous, high-grade PNSTs [11, 12].
Validating these genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMMs), MPNSTs from human patients also often
show reduced PTEN expression compared to normal
nerve or benign neurofibromas, and alteration in TP53 [2,
12]. Less is known about the genetic changes that occur
in spontaneous MPNSTs, but alterations in sporadic and
NF1-associated MPNSTs include over-expression of
the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), loss of
PTEN, TP53 alteration, and loss of Cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) [2, 8, 13-15].
One common feature of sporadic and NF1 driven
MPNSTs is activation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathways [4, 16, 17]. NF1 encodes the protein
Neurofibromin, a Ras GTPase activating protein (RasGAP) [18]. When NF1 is lost, Ras accumulates in its
GTP-bound, active state, resulting in hyperactive signaling
through both the MAPK and PI3K pathway [18]. While

volume, but did not result in the induction of apoptosis of
tumor cells [29].
To date, no clinical trials evaluating molecularly
targeted therapies have prevented neurofibroma formation,
stopped the growth of neurofibromas, or caused prolonged
arrest of MPNST growth [31]. In preclinical studies
using Everolimus or PD-901, it has been shown that,
while these drugs can be either modestly or transiently
effective, in most cases, each inhibitor acts cytostatically
and does not induce apoptosis [32]. It is thought that this
could be due to the effect of negative feedback, and/or
the need to inhibit multiple pathways to elicit a cytotoxic
response [20, 21]. In light of these findings, we sought
to address whether co-targeting the mTOR and MAPK
pathways would be more effective in treating MPNSTs
than targeting either pathway alone. We addressed this
by testing the effect of each of these drugs alone and in
combination in two GEMM-PNSTs. One model represents
NF1-associated MPNSTs, in which both Nf1 and Pten are
biallelically deleted in Schwann cells and their precursors
(Dhh-Cre; Nf1 flox/flox; Pten flox/flox) [12]. The other model
more closely resembles spontaneous MPNSTs in which
Pten is biallelically inactivated in Schwann cells and
EGFR is overexpressed (Dhh-Cre; Pten flox/flox; CNPasehEGFR) [13].
Here we confirm that targeting the MAPK pathway
with the MEK inhibitor PD-901 and targeting the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with the mTOR inhibitor
Everolimus is effective at inhibiting cellular growth in
both NF1-assscociated and spontaneous MPNST cell
lines in vitro, and that these inhibitors appear to act
cytostatically. When given in combination, Everolimus
and PD-901 synergistically inhibit proliferation and
effectively induce apoptosis in multiple MPNST cell
lines. Based on this in vitro data, we tested the efficacy
of these inhibitors as single agents and in combination in
NF1-associated and spontaneous GEMM-PNST. While
Everolimus and PD-901 alone each reduce tumor burden
and/or grade, the combination of these two drugs is much
more effective, resulting in a reduction in tumor burden,
size and grade as well as an increase in survival in both
mouse models. When given as single agents, these drugs
are initially effective at reducing signaling through their
respective pathways, but long term treatment results in
the development of drug resistance, with reactivation of
the target pathways. In contrast, when Everolimus and
PD-901 are given simultaneously, signaling through both
the PI3K and MAPK pathway remains effectively and
persistently inhibited.

Everolimus and PD-901 are effective at inhibiting
cellular growth in both NF1-associated and
spontaneous MPNST cell lines
To assess the therapeutic potential of inhibiting
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways in human
MPNSTs, a panel of two immortalized human Schwann
cell lines (iHSC1λ and iHSC2λ [33]) and five human
MPNST cell lines (S462 [34], S462-TY [35], ST8814
[36], T265 [37], and STS-26T [38]) were exposed to
the mTOR inhibitor Everolimus and the MEK inhibitor
PD-901. When exposed to Everolimus, immortalized
Schwann cell lines were less sensitive to inhibition of cell
growth than the MPNST cell lines, with 50% inhibitory
concentrations (IC50s) of 2.6- 2.7 µM versus 1.0- 2.1
µM in the MPNST cell lines (Figure 1A). Similarly, PD901 IC50s were 134.0µM- 147.1µM in the immortalized
human Schwann cell lines versus 1.3- 127.8 µM in the
MPNST cell lines (Figure 1A). These data suggest that
MPNST cells are more sensitive to inhibition of mTOR
and MEK than untransformed Schwann cells.
In addition to inhibiting cell growth at relatively low
IC50s in MPNST cell lines as single agents, Everolimus
and PD-901 also acted synergistically to inhibit cellular
growth. MPNST cell lines treated with varying dilutions of
Everolimus and PD-901 at their respective IC50s resulted
in combination indices of 0.02 to 0.11 (Figure 1B).
Combination indices below 1.0, as calculated using the
software Calcusyn ©, suggest that in MPNST cell lines,
Everolimus and PD-901 function to inhibit cellular growth
synergistically.

Inhibiting the mTOR and MEK in combination
induces apoptosis in MPNST cell lines
To further understand how Everolimus and PD901 function to inhibit cell growth synergistically, we
exposed the S462 MPNST cell line to the IC50 doses of
Everolimus and PD-901 and assessed apoptosis. In both
cases, treatment with a single agent at a concentration
that inhibits 50% cell survival resulted in less than 50%
cell death, demonstrating that these drugs function largely
cytostatically (Figure 1C). In contrast, when the S462
cells were treated with the IC25 doses of Everolimus
and PD-901 in combination, the percentage of cells
undergoing apoptosis was nearly 70%. These data suggest
that co-targeting mTOR and MEK results in a synergistic
induction of apoptosis.

Everolimus and PD-901 as single agents are
moderately effective at reducing disease in two
GEMMs of MPNSTs

inactivation of both Nf1 and Pten in Schwann cells and
their precursors [40, 41]. This GEMM has advantages
for in vivo drug testing, including severe and fully
penetrant peripheral nerve disease, a median lifespan of
approximately 15 days, and an average tumor burden of
21.8 high-grade peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs)
per animal [12]. Pups were divided into 4 cohorts and
given DMSO (vehicle control), 10 mg/kg/day Everolimus,
5 mg/kg/day PD-901, or a combination of 5 mg/kg/day
Everolimus and 2.5 mg/kg/day PD-901 beginning on postnatal day 0. When the NF1-associated MPNST mouse
model (Dhh; Nf1 fl/fl; Pten fl/fl) was treated with Everolimus
or PD-901, survival was significantly prolonged from an
average of 15.8 days with DMSO treatment, to 22.4 days

To test the efficacy of targeting the mTOR and
MEK for MPNSTs in vivo, two GEMMs were treated with
Everolimus and PD-901. In a mouse model of MPNSTs
representing NF1-associated Schwann cell tumors,
the Desert Hedgehog promoter was used to drive Cre
Recombinase (Dhh-Cre) resulting in Cre Recombinase
expression in Schwann cells and their precursors [39].
Combined with floxed alleles of Nf1 (Nf1 fl/fl) and Pten
(Pten fl/fl), expression of Dhh-Cre results in the biallelic

in two immortalized human Schwann cell lines (iHSC1λ, iHSC2λ) and five MPNST cell lines (S462, S462-TY, ST8814, T265, and STS26T) were determined using the MTS assay for proliferation and calculated using Calcusyn software ©. Immortalized Schwann cells are
more resistant to inhibition of cell growth by Everolimus and PD-901, while the MPNST cell lines are much more sensitive as shown by
their lower IC50 values. B. The combination index (CI) for Everolimus and PD-901 was determined using MTS cell growth data for the
combination of drugs at varying IC50 dilutions and calculated using Calcusyn © software. Combination indices of less than one suggest
that the two drugs act synergistically to inhibit cell growth in all five MPNST cell lines. C. TUNEL assay assessing apoptosis in the S462
MPNST cell line treated with IC50 doses of Everolimus or PD-901 as single agents. The percentage of cell undergoing apoptosis is less

IC25 doses, the percentage of apoptosis is nearly 70%, suggesting that in combination, these drugs act synergistically to induce apoptosis.

p=0.036, respectively) (Figure 2A).
In a mouse model representing spontaneous
MPNSTs, Dhh-Cre is again used to biallelically inactivate
a floxed allele of Pten, and human EGFR is expressed
under the control of the 2’, 3’ cyclic nucleotide 3/
phosphodiesterase promoter, which results in the overexpression of EGFR in Schwann cells [39, 41, 42]. In
this model, mice have a median of 26 days, with 100%
penetrance of high-grade PNSTs and approximately 13.7
tumors per animal [13]. Pups were separated into the same
4 cohorts described above for the NF1-associated mouse
model and treatment also began on post-natal day 0. When
the spontaneous MPNST mouse model (Dhh; Pten fl/fl;
EGFR) was treated with Everolimus or PD-901, survival
was also extended from an average of 29.4 days with

DMSO to 39.8 days with Everolimus and 48 days with
PD-901 (p=0.109 and p=0.019, respectively) (Figure 2B).
Although Everolimus extended lifespan in the NF1associated mouse model, the number of tumors per animal
was not significantly reduced at the time of necropsy
(Figure 2C). PD-901 treatment in the NF1-associated
mouse model significantly reduced tumor burden from
20.6 tumors per animal with DMSO treatment to 12.8
tumors per animal with PD-901 treatment (p=0.0002)
(Figure 2C). In contrast to the NF1-associated model,
when the spontaneous mouse model was treated with
Everolimus, the number of tumors per animal was reduced
from 15.4 tumors per animal in the DMSO treated cohort,
to 10.6 tumors per animals treated with Everolimus (p=
0.0189) (Figure 2D). PD-901 did not significantly reduce
tumor burden in the spontaneous mouse model (Figure

enlarged at only 15 days. In contrast, Everolimus and PD901 treatment resulted in fewer and smaller tumors at later
time points (day 23 and 25, respectively).
In the spontaneous MPNST mouse model, DMSO
treated animals had approximately 50% low grade,
neurofibroma-like tumors (grade 1-2) and 50% high
grade (grade 2/3 and 3) tumors, as assessed by H & E,
S100, and Ki67 as described above (Figure 3B & 5A).
When these mice were treated with Everolimus, tumor
grade was reduced, with the majority of tumors being
low grade neurofibromas, and some enlarged DRGs even
being graded as peripheral nerve hyperplasia. PD-901 was
not effective at reducing tumor grade. Figure 5B shows
examples of DRG tumors with each treatment. DMSO
treated animals had nearly every DRG nerve enlarged,
while mice treated with Everolimus and PD-901 had fewer
and/or smaller DRG tumors, at later time points.

Tumors treated with each drug were histologically
analyzed to determine tumor grade as previously
described [43, 44]. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)
staining was performed to assess cellularity and mitotic
index, immunohistochemistry for S100β confirmed
the Schwann cell origin of these tumors, and Ki67
immunohistochemistry demonstrated the level of cellular
proliferation (Figure 3A). Although the number of tumors
per animal in the NF1-associated mouse model was not
reduced, tumor grade was much lower with Everolimus
treatment (Figure 3A & 4A). Tumors from mice treated
with DMSO were mostly grade 2 PNSTs, with some being
grade 1. When these mice were treated with Everolimus,
there was a dramatic reduction in the fraction of grade
2 tumors, with most tumors being grade 1 following
treatment. While PD-901 treatment alone dramatically
reduced tumor burden in this model, all tumors analyzed
were grade 2. Figure 3B & 4B show examples of the
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tumors in each of the treatment
groups. DMSO treated mice have nearly every DRG nerve

extended lifespan and dramatically reduced tumor burden,
although all tumors that were analyzed at necropsy
were grade 2, as assessed by H & E, S100, and Ki67 as
described above (Figure 2A, 2C, 3A, 4A). Importantly,
the DRG tumors from mice treated with the combination
therapy were somewhat smaller at necropsy (Figure 4B).
In contrast, combination treatment of Everolimus and
PD-901 in the spontaneous mouse model resulted in all
low grade tumors (Figure 3B, 5A). Additionally, fewer
enlarged DRG were observed, and those seen in this
model were quite small (Figure 5B).

Co-targeting mTOR and MEK in both mouse
models resulted in a significant improvement in survival
compared to vehicle control (DMSO) treated animals
(23.5 days, p= 0.025 in the NF1-asociated model and
42.3 days, p= 0.002 in the spontaneous model), although
the extension of lifespan was similar to treatment with
Everolimus or PD-901 alone (Figure 2A-B). We found
that treatment of mice with a combination of Everolimus
and PD-901 at doses given as single agents (10 mg/kg/day
and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively), resulted in toxicity, with
mice becoming very slow and shakey in their movements,
and showing signs of intestinal damage. To avoid toxicity,
mice were treated with significantly lower doses of drug
in combination (5 mg/kg/day Everolimus and 2.5 mg/
kg/day PD-901). Both mouse models had significant
reductions in tumor burden when drugs were combined
(7.5 tumors per animal in the NF1-asociated model, p
<0.0001 and 11.8 tumors per animal in the spontaneous
model, p=0.0474) (Figure 2C-D).

Inhibiting mTOR or MEK signaling results in the
development of drug resistance with reactivation

To assess pathway inhibition in vivo, we monitored
the level of p-AKT, p-4EBP, and p-ERK in tumors from
animals treated with Everolimus or PD-901. As expected,
in mice treated with Everolimus, the levels of p-AKT
and p-4EBP were reduced at early time points (day 24) at
which there were few tumors, all of which were relatively
small (Figure 6A). At later time points (day 55), tumors
from Everolimus treated mice were more numerous and
larger, and western blot analysis showed that both p-AKT

of signaling through the MAPK and PI3K pathways.
A. Western blot analysis and quantification of phospho-AKT
and phospho-4EBP in DRG tumors from animals treated with
DMSO or Everolimus at early and later time points. At early
time points, Everolimus effectively reduces phospho-AKT
levels, but at later time points, the level of phospho-AKT is very
high. Similarly, at early time points, Everolimus also effectively
reduces phospho-4EBP levels, but at later time points, the level
of phospho-4EBP is very high, suggesting the development of
resistance to Everolimus treatment. B. Western blot analysis
and quantification of phospho-ERK levels in DRG tumors
from animals treated with DMSO or PD-901 at early and later
time points. At early time points, phospho-ERK is inhibited,
but at later time points the level of phospho-ERK increases
suggesting that these mice are becoming resistant to PD-901
treatment. C. Western blot analysis of DRG tumors treated with
DMSO, Everolimus, PD-901, or a combination of Everolimus
and PD-901 at late time points. Quantification of western blot
demonstrates that at late time points, the level of phospho-AKT
is elevated in Everolimus treated animals, but remains low when
animals are treated with a combination of Everolimus and PD901. Similarly, the level of phospho-4EBP remains lowest when
mice are given the combination treatment. Phosho-ERK levels
also remain lowest when mice are given Everolimus and PD-901
in combination.

and p-4EBP were elevated, suggesting that long term
treatment of Everolimus results in the development of
drug resistance (Figure 6A). Similarly, tumors from mice
treated with PD-901 at early time points (day 25) have a
reduced level of p-ERK (Figure 6B). At later time points
(day 45), the level of p-ERK has strongly increased, again
suggesting that long term PD-901 treatment results in the
development of resistance (Figure 6B).

and are highly associated with peripheral nerves [1, 46].
Another advantage of our models is that these mice rapidly
and uniformly form high-grade PNSTs [12, 13]. While
other models have evaluated the pre-clinical efficacy
of targeted therapies in neurofibromas, it is important
to evaluate these therapies in mouse models of PNSTs,
as clinical trials are likely to evaluate these therapies in
malignant tumors.
	 Another important aspect of this preclinical
study is that targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK
pathways alone and in combination was studied in two
preclinical mouse models that represent two subsets
of Schwann cell tumors, those that form in the context
of NF1 and those that form spontaneously [12, 13]. By
showing efficacy of these targeted therapies in two
different GEMMs, we hope that there will be an increased
likelihood of success in human clinical trials. Finally, these
GEMMs have advantages for pre-clinical drug testing, as
the mice rapidly form tumors with 100% penetrance and
multiple tumors per animal [12, 13].
We show that survival is significantly increased
in both mouse models when the mice are treated with
Everolimus, PD-901, or the combination of both
(Figure 2). In the NF1-associated mouse model, the
combination of Everolimus and PD-901 significantly
decreased tumor burden and size, although tumor grade
remained high (Figure 2-4). In the spontaneous MPNST
mouse model, tumor burden, size, and grade were all
significantly decreased when Everolimus and PD-901
were administered in combination (Figure 2, 3 & 5).
While these drugs clearly demonstrated efficacy in these
models, we have not ruled out the possibility that in
addition to inhibiting the malignant Schwann cells, these
drugs could also be affecting non-neoplastic cells, such
as mast cells and fibroblasts, and may be having an effect
on angiogenesis and tumor vasculature. Finally, it should
be noted that PD-901 has been shown to have off target
effects [47]. Although the off target effects of this inhibitor
may be playing a role in our study, we have demonstrated
that PD-0325901 does in fact inhibit MEK (Figure 6),
and the use of other MEK inhibitors would be necessary
to determine whether specifically inhibiting MEK is
necessary for the effect seen in our study. Although there
may be off target effects, PD-901 is still being used in
preclinical studies, as well as multiple clinical trials for
cancers dependent on MAPK signaling.
Further research will be necessary to determine
the exact mechanism by which PI3K/AKT/mTOR and
MAPK signaling cascades become activated in benign
Schwann cell tumors and MPNSTs. While loss of NF1
is clearly functioning to drive benign neurofibromas, it
appears that further activation of Ras/PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling is required for malignant transformation [1,
8-10]. We have previously showed a reduction in PTEN
expression in both human and murine MPNSTs, but a
mechanistic understanding of how PTEN expression

Co-targeting mTOR and MEK results in
prolonged and persistent inhibition of signaling
through both pathways
Because long term treatment with Everolimus or PD901 resulted in reactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and
MAPK pathways, we sought to understand the mechanism
by which the combination therapy more effectively treats
disease in our models. In contrast to the reactivation of the
MEK and mTOR signaling seen in single drug treatments,
when mice were treated with Everolimus and PD-901
in combination, p-AKT, p-4EBP, and p-ERK were all
inhibited at early timepoints, and remained low at later
time points (Figure 6C). This suggests that co-targeting
the mTOR and MEK pathways in vivo results in prolonged
and persistent pathway inhibition, resulting in an effective
combinational targeted therapy.

DISCUSSION
Analysis of human Schwann cell tumors and mouse
models of neurofibromas and MPNSTs have demonstrated
the functional importance of both PI3K/AKT/mTOR
and MAPK pathway activation [17, 18, 29, 30]. While
targeting either of these pathways alone in preclinical
models of MPNST has shown moderate efficacy, we show
that co-targeting mTOR and MEK is more effective both
in vitro and in vivo than targeting either pathway alone.
In MPNST cell lines, we show that a combination of the
mTOR inhibitor, Everolimus, and the MEK inhibitor, PD901, act synergistically to inhibit growth and induce cell
death (Figure 1). While many targeted therapies, including
these, have been shown to act cytostatically, it is of
clinical importance that, in combination, these inhibitors
act cytotoxically [20, 21].
We believe that this study has many advantages over
previous pre-clinical studies. First, GEMMs better reflect
patient outcomes than in vitro and xenograft studies, as
these tumors model the genetic changes, progressive
evolution, anatomic location, pathology, histology, and
micro-environmental interactions of human tumors [45].
In addition, as these tumors form in situ, the contribution
of other cell types can be evaluated [45]. This is especially
important in studying Schwann cell tumors, as these
tumors are quite angiogenic, contain heterogeneous
populations of fibroblasts, macrophages, and mast cells,

is down-regulated may uncover other potential drug
targets, such as miRNAs and control of methylation [12,
48]. Clearly, in Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), these
mechanisms play a role in Schwann cell tumorigenesis,
and have been utilized in preclinical studies as promising
drug targets [49, 50]. Another recent study reported the
identification of FAM83B as a novel activator of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling that was capable of
driving transformation of human mammary epithelial cells
[51]. This study also implicates FAM83B as a novel target
for drug therapy, and further work should be pursued to
see whether FAM83B plays a role in Schwann cell tumors
as well [51].
The development of resistance to targeted therapies
in cancer has been well documented [21, 52]. We show
that when mice are treated with either Everolimus or
PD-901 as single agents over a long period of time,
resistance does indeed develop, and the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR and MAPK pathways become reactivated (Figure
6). In contrast, when mTOR and MEK are co-targeted in
these two mouse models, both signaling pathways remain
inhibited over the course of treatment (Figure 6). This
likely accounts for the reason that single drug treatments
do not show the efficacy that the combination therapy
shows in these two mouse models and may explain why
either of these drugs given alone in other models have only
showed modest efficacy [25, 26, 29]. It is also likely that
mice treated with Everolimus and PD-901 in combination
may also develop resistance, although more delayed than
with single treatments, through different mechanisms,
as these mice eventually succumb to their tumors due
to paralysis. Future work will be required to determine
if other pathways become activated, allowing for tumor
cells to escape inhibition from Everolimus and PD-901.
Future work will also need to be done to study
the effect of co-targeting mTOR and MEK in other less
severe models of neurofibromas or MPNST development,
including other GEMMs as well as xenograft models. In
fact, in slower developing tumor models, these drugs may
be more effective, as they have more time to effectively
inhibit these pathways and control cellular proliferation
and transformation. It will be important to determine the
safety and efficacy of co-targeting the mTOR and MEK
pathways in human patients. We found that treatment
of mice with a combination of Everolimus and PD-901
at doses given as single agents resulted in toxicity. To
avoid toxicity, mice were treated with significantly lower
doses of drug in combination, and this approach may be
necessary in clinical trials as well. It is also of interest
to study whether the combination of Everolimus and
PD-901 could be used to treat plexiform neurofibromas
in an attempt to prevent transformation to MPNSTs. This
could be done in the Dhh-Cre; Nf1 flox/flox model [11].
One difficulty that could arise that we and others have
demonstrated, is that long term treatment with Everolimus
causes immunosuppresion, which could add a layer of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

complexity to the use of this drug in a clinical setting over
a long period of time for plexiform neurofibromas [53].
Additionally, it has become clear that the immune system
can play an important role in cancer, therefore, immune
system suppression may not be desirable [54]. While there
are challenges with implementing new targeted therapies
in the clinic, the data presented here demonstrates that cotargeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK may be beneficial
for patients suffering from Schwann cell tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Culture Reagents and Cell Lines
Cultured immortalized Schwann cells (iHSC1λ
and iHSC2λ) were both derived from a patient’s normal
sciatic nerve, are NF1 wild-type, and were immortalized
by hTERT and CDK4R24C to allow in vitro studies [33].
Immortalized human Schwann cell and MPNST cell
lines (S462 [34], S462-TY [35], ST8814 [36], T265
[37], and STS-26T [38]) were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modification of Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin
(Cellgro) and cultured on tissue culture-treated plates
under standard conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2.

In Vitro Drug Studies to Determine 50%
Inhibitory
Concentration
(IC50)
and
Combination Index (CI)
Everolimus and PD-901 were solubilized in DMSO
and then subsequently diluted in sterile PBS. 1,200 cells
per well of a 96-well plate were treated with varying
concentration of drug in quadruplicate and assayed for
cell viability using the MTS assay (Promega) to determine
the IC50 values, 48 hours after drug treatment. Drug was
added at the time of cell plating. All data analysis was
done using Calcusyn software (CalcuSyn Version 2.1,
BioSoft). A combination of Everolimus and PD-901 at
varying dilutions of their IC50 concentration was used
to determine the combination index (CI) using Calcusyn
software (CalcuSyn © Version 2.1, BioSoft).

In Vivo Drug Studies

PBS before incubating with goat anti-rabbit horseradish
peroxidase conjugated-secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). After three washes with PBS, the sections
were treated with freshly prepared DAB substrate (Vector
Laboratories) and allowed to develop before stopping
the reaction in water once adequate signal was obtained.
Finally, sections were then lightly counter-stained with
hematoxylin, dehydrated through gradual increase in
ethanol concentration, cleared in Xylene (Fisher Scientific)
and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific).

Everolimus and PD-901 were solubilized in DMSO
and then subsequently diluted in PBS and sterilized. Mice
were weighed daily and given 10 mg/kg/day of Everolimus
or 5 mg/kg/day of PD-901. For combination studies mice
were given 5 mg/kg/day of Everolimus and 2.5 mg/kg/
day of PD-901 at the same time. Mice were weighed
and monitored daily, and sacrificed when they became
moribund. Tumors, nerves, and organs were harvested
for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. All
animal work was conducted according to the University of
Minnesota’s approved animal welfare protocol.

Histologic Evaluation
Sections stained with H&E, Ki67 and S100β were
evaluated for all tumors. Each sample was graded using
established criteria for tumors arising in genetically
engineered mice [43, 44]. Briefly, low-grade PNSTs
exhibited low cellularity with little if any nuclear atypia
and mitotic activity. High-grade PNSTs were increasingly
cellular with increasing nuclear atypia and increasing
mitotic activity.

Peripheral Nerve Tumor Analysis
Tumors were carefully removed from the sacrificed
animal under a dissecting microscope (Leica), washed,
and placed in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
Sciatic nerves, brachial plexi, sacral plexi, trigeminal
nerves, spinal cord, brain, and liver were also removed and
observed for any abnormalities. The number of enlarged
dorsal root ganglia was counted for the whole spinal cord.
All tumor nodules (>1 mm in diameter) were carefully
removed from the spinal cord.

Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining
For immunofluorescence assays, cells were grown
to 80% confluency on 8 chambered slides (Lab-TekII).
Cells were fixed in 10% formalin and washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Tween-20
(PBST). TUNEL staining was performed using the In
Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Roche). Slides were
mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent with
DAPI (Invitrogen) and images using a Zeiss Axiovert 25
inverted microscope. For analysis of cell death, total cells
and TUNEL positive cells were counted and averaged over
three independent frames with 50-100 cells per frame.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining
Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, routinely
processed, and embedded in paraffin. Sections for
histology were cut at five microns from the paraffin
blocks using a standard microtome (Leica), mounted
and heat fixed onto glass slides. Slides were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard protocols.

Mouse Tumor Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Western Blot Analysis

Immunohistochemistry was done as previously
described [12, 13]. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded
tissues were sectioned at five microns, mounted, and heatfixed onto glass slides to be used for IHC analyses. The
glass section slides were de-waxed and rehydrated through
a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration. The antigen
epitopes on the tissue sections were then unmasked using
a commercially available unmasking solution (Vector
Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The tissue section slides were then treated with 3%
hydrogen peroxide to remove endogenous peroxidases.
Blocking was performed at room temperature in normal
goat serum (5% serum in PBS) in a humidified chamber
for one hour. Sections were then incubated overnight at
4°C in a humidified chamber with primary antibody (S100
(Santa Cruz 1:100), Ki67 (Novocastra 1:200)). After
primary incubation, sections were washed thoroughly in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

One million cells were lysed using an NP-40 buffer
(50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
5mM NaF, 1mM EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor
(Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Whole cell
lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Protein samples
were prepared in an SDS solution with reducing agent
(Invitrogen) and run on 10% Bis-Tris pre-made gels
(NuPage, Invitrogen). Gels were transferred onto PVDF
membranes using the iBlot system (Invitrogen) and
activated in 100% methanol. Membranes were blocked
in filtered 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 2 hours
at room temp followed by a 4°C overnight incubation in
primary antibody. The primary antibodies used in this
study were: p-AKT S473 (Cell Signaling 1:100), p-4EBP
(Cell Signaling 1:500), p-ERK (Cell Signaling 1:1000),
and GAPDH (Cell Signaling 1:2000). Following primary

antibody incubation, membranes were thoroughly washed
in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween-20
(TBST) and incubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP
conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:4000
in 0.5% BSA, 1 hour at room temperature). Blots were
thoroughly washed in TBST and developed using the
SuperSignal WestPico Chemiluminescence Detection Kit
(Thermo Scientific). Densitometry quantification was done
using ImageJ software and normalized to GAPDH [55].
