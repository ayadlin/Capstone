ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) remains to be an incurable disease. The purpose
of this study was to evaluate the effect of ABCG2 monoclonal antibody (McAb)
combined with paclitaxel (PTX) conjugated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on MM
progressed from cancer stem cells (CSCs)in non-obese-diabetic/severe-combinedimmunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mouse model. Mice were injected with MM CSCs as
marked by CD138−CD34− phenotypes through tail veins. The developed MM mice were
examined by micro-computer tomography scanning, ultrasonography and enzymelinked immunosorbent analysis. These mice were then intravenously treated with
different combinations of NPs, PTX, McAb, PTX-NPs and melphalan/prednisone once
a week for four weeks. The injected mice developed characteristic MM-associated
syndromes, including lytic bone lesions, renal damages and proteinuria. All the treated
mice showed decrease in bone lesions, renal damages and anemia but increase in
apoptosis compared with the mice treated with NPs only. In particular, the treatment
with ABCG2 McAb plus PTX-NPs induced the strongest therapeutic response and had
an efficacy even better than that of melphalan/prednisone, a conventional regimen
for MM patients. These data suggest that PTX-NPs with ABCG2 McAb can be developed
into potential treatment regimens for patients with relapsed/refractory MM.

prednisone, and carfilzomib as well as hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation have dramatically improved the
therapeutic response and survival rate of MM patients.
However, most MM patients are still facing a high risk
of ultimate relapses due to the persistence of minimal
residual malignant cells in the bone marrow. Consequently
MM remains to be an incurable disease [1, 2]. Emerging
evidence supports the view that a subpopulation of MM
cells that are highly resistant to conventional cancer

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a debilitating disease
characterized by neoplastic growth of plasma cells in
the bone marrow and responsible for the most deaths
of patients with hematologic malignancies. Clinically,
MM patients often manifest destructive bone lesions,
renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia and anemia. Agents

therapies shares certain features with cancer stem cells
(CSCs) and may be responsible for tumor-initiating, selfrenewal, drug resistances and metastasis [3–6]. Thus, it
is clinically desirable to develop a therapeutic paradigm
that targets specific molecules associated with MM
CSCs, and thereby overcoming the drug resistance by
eradicating CSCs.
It is known that CSCs often exhibit a high activity
of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, in particular
ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2),
a surface molecule that contributes to drug resistance
by pumping out intracellular drugs. Indeed, there have
been reports that using anti-ABC monoclonal antibodies
are able to inhibit partially cellular drug resistance by
compromising the growth of CSCs [7, 8].
Paclitaxel (PTX) has a broad spectrum of
cytotoxicity towards a variety of cancers, including MM.
However, it has a poor solubility, and clinical usage of
its adjuvants such as Cremophor EL often causes severe
allergic reactions, which significantly limits the efficacy
of PTX-based therapies [6, 9]. Recent advances have
evidenced that engineered nanoparticles (NPs) offer many
therapeutic advances over traditional formulations because
they can be readily manipulated into particles with desired
sizes and surface properties that would make it possible to
conjugate and deliver certain pharmaceutical compounds
that are otherwise insoluble and unstable [10–15].
Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) such as magnetite Fe3O4
based NPs have small sizes, large active surface areas,
an excellent biocompatibility, and are readily internalized
into cells and sustain well under endocytic environments.
In the presented study we attempted to target MM CSCs
by using a monoclonal antibody against ABCG2, and
to deliver PTX by using NPs. To evaluate the anti-MM
efficacy of the new approach, we also developed a MM
model in which MM CSCs derived from either human
MM RPMI 8266 cells or bone marrow mononuclear
cells (BMMCs) from MM patients were used to develop
MM-like malgiancies in xonografted mice. We found that
application of NPs carrying PTX in combination with the
ABCG2 antibody improved significantly the efficacy of
inhibiting MM progression compared with that using each
agent alone.

bone marrow density (BMD) of humeri and femora of
injected mice by micro-CT, a gold standard for imaging
MM [16]. As shown in Fig. 1A and 1B, the BMD of both
humerus and femurs of MM CSC-injected mice (model)
was significantly reduced compared with the control
group (normal). Micro-CT also detected a few lowdensity shadows (arrows, Fig. 1C) in the kidney of model
mice, suggestive of the presence of MM lesions and
renal impairment. Indeed, ultrasound imaging analysis
of the renal arteries revealed that the peak systolic blood
flow velocity (BFV) in the renal artery was significantly
decreased in model mice (Fig. 1D and  1E). To assess
further the renal damage, we measured protein contents
in the urine and found that the proteinuria level was
markedly enhanced in the model mice versus the normal
mice (Fig. 1F). Thus, mice injected with MM CSCs
shared many pathological characteristics with those
of MM.

PTX-NPs combined with ABCG2 McAb reduces
effectively MM-associated bone lesions
To determine whether prepared PTX-NPs as
illustrated in Fig. 2A remain a nano property, we analyzed
PTX-NPs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and dynamic light scattering (DLS), which demonstrated
that PTX-NPs have a quite uniformed core size of 7.63 nm
(Fig. 2B), and hydrodynamic diameter of 69.0  nm
(Fig. 2C), the latter of which includes both the core-shell
and the aqueous layer.
To evaluate the therapeutic effect of PTX-NPs on
MM progression, the mice injected with MM CSCs were
treated once a week with different combinations of PTX,
NPs and McAb. In addition, injected mice were treated
with MP, which is a common and effective regimen for
MM patients. After 4 weeks of treatments, the mice were
subjected to BMD examination. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
lowest BMD was found with the model group in which
the injected mice were treated with PBS only. The group
of which the injected mice were treated with NPs alone
also showed a poor BMD. In contrast, the mice treated
with the other combinations showed improved BMD at
different degrees. Significantly, the mice that were treated
with McAb-PTX-NPs had restored BMD up to the level
similar to that of the normal group and even higher than
that of mice treated with MP (Fig. 3B).
Bone lesions in treated mice were further analyzed
by histology. The model mice had developed significant
lytic bone lesions, including bone trabeculae destruction,
sinus extension and breakage, RBC seepage and
edema in the bone marrow matrix, and aggregated and
infiltrated inflammatory cells (arrows) in the compact
bone (Fig. 4A). The lytic bone lesion, as determined by
infiltrated inflammatory cells, was markedly decreased
in the mice treated with McAb-PTX-NPs compared with

RESULTS
Mice injected with MM CSCs manifests typical
MM-associated syndromes
To establish a MM animal model, we isolated MM
CSCs from human MM RPMI 8226 cells based on the
CD138−CD34−cell phenotypes17 and injected them via
tail veins into NOD/SCID mice. Because MM patients
were frequently associated with bone lesions and kidney
damages, we examined on day 18 after implantation the

mice, respectively. However, there was no significant

group (Fig. 4B).

mice had a less normal current velocity profile than did
McAb-PTX-NPs treated mice.
Renal sections derived from the mice after 28 days
of treatments were also subjected to histological analysis.
Apparent renal damages as indicated by large blue areas
were seen in massion-stained sections from the model
mice (Fig. 6A, top panel). Also, periodic acid-schiff
staining revealed that the model mice had over 75%
glomeruli that were apparently hardened (bottom panel),
which is pathologically equivalent to a 4 score of renal
damages [15, 17]. The renal damages became apparently
less severe in the mice treated with the other agents. In
particular, the mice treated with McAb-PTX-NPs or
MP showed a significant alleviation of renal damages
(Fig. 6B).
Kidney damages in MM patients are often
manifested by increase in protein contents in urine and in
the levels of serum free light chains (FLCs), calcium and
IL-6 in serum [17–20]. To analyze the effect of McAbPTX-NPs on these MM-associated disorders, we used
ELISA to measure the contents of these soluble factors.
The result of this study indicated that the treatment of MM

McAb-PTX-NPs improves the kidney function of
MM bearing mice
To evaluate whether McAb-PTX-NPs have any
therapeutic effect on the MM-mediated kidney disorders,
we analyzed the renal artery of treated mice by ultrasound
imaging. As shown in Fig. 5, the renal artery of normal
mice had a stable current velocity profile and a peak
BFV at 295.9, whereas that of MM bearing mice without
treatment had a nearly diminished current velocity wave
and markedly decreased BFV (140.1). Notably, the peak
BFV of the renal artery of the mice treated with McAbPTX-NPs was significantly recovered to 254.6, which was
accompanied with a stable arterial current velocity. The
mice treated with MP also showed a significant recovery
and had a peak BFV at 250.5, which was statistically the
same as that treated with McAb-PTX-NPs. However, these

mice with PTX-NPs significantly decreased the levels of
FLC, calcium and IL-6 in serum as well as proteins in
urine compared with that of PTX or McAb alone (Fig. S1).
This efficiency was further enhanced by combining PTXNPs with ABCG2 McAb. In addition to the soluble
molecules, the number of RBCs, as measured by RBC
counting, was also elevated similarly in the mice treated
by these agents (Fig. S1).

alone, which ranged from 21.02% to 38.83% (Fig. 7B).

McAb-PTX-NPs has a strong therapeutic effect
on cancer cells derived from MM patients
To determine whether McAb-PTX-NPs have a
therapeutic effect on primary MM cells, we isolated
CD138−CD34−cells from BMMCs of three MM patients.
These cells have characteristics of CSCs as determined by
a series of in vitro assays (Fig. S2), which demonstrated
that CD138−CD34−cells had a higher growth rate
(Fig.  S2A), a higher clonogenic potential (Fig.  S2B
and 2C), a higher drug resistance to vincristine (Fig. S2D),
and a higher ability to form tumors in xenografted mice
than did non-CD138−CD34−cells (Fig. S2E). In addition,
CD138−CD34−cells from nine MM patients showed a
significantly increased expression levels of ABCG2 at both
mRNA and cell surface (Fig. S3).
Upon treatment with McAb-PTX-NPs, MM-derived
CD138−CD34−cells underwent to significant apoptosis

McAb-PTX-NPs induces strong apoptosis with
BMMCs derived from MM mice
To explore a cellular mechanism for the anti-MM
function of McAb-PTX-NPs, we performed flow
cytometry to analyze the apoptosis with BMMCs derived
from treated mice. As shown in Fig. 7A, normal and
model mice or the mice treated with NPs contained
few apoptotic BMMCs. In contrast, mice treated with
other agents showed a marked increase in the number of
apoptotic BMMCs. Among them, McAb-PTX-NPs caused
the highest apoptotic rate (58.98%), which is significantly

increased significantly their BMD compared with the
control mice (data not shown), demonstrating that McAbPTX-NPs have also a strong therapeutic effect on primary
MM cells.

because this phenotype cells isolated from MM cell
line RPMI 8226 have the characteristics of MM CSCs,
which exhibited stronger proliferation, migration, drug
resistance to PTX, clone formation ability, tumorigenic
potential and more ABCG2 molecular expression than
the non-CD138−CD34−cells [23, 24]. In addition, we
found that such population derived from MM patients
possesses typical CSC features and that they are enriched
in ABCG2 expression on cell surface. Our finding is
essentially consistent with the previous findings by
others [2, 22, 25] and by us [23, 24]. Indeed, we had
previously been able to establish tumors in mice by
subcutaneous injection of MM CD138−CD34−CSCs
from human cell lines. However, whether these injected
mice have MM characteristics remained unknown. In
the presented study we injected, via dorsal tail vein,
MM CD138−CD34−CSCs into NOD/SCID mice and
demonstrated that these injected mice developed typical
MM-associated symptoms including abnormally poor
BMD, high levels of urine protein, high levels of FLC,
calcium and IL-6, and impairments in the function of
kidney. In view of the fact that mice normally do not
contain detectable level of protein in urine and that the

DISCUSSION
MM CSCs may be responsible for chemoresistances, the primary cause for the clinical failure in
complete elimination of MM cells. One of the possible
mechanisms for drug resistance is that CSCs express
high levels of ABCG2 transporter [8, 21, 22], which
facilitates pumping out therapeutic drugs out of cells.
Recent advances have evidenced that the targeted
therapies have promised to improve the efficacy of
cancer treatments by aiming at inhibition of specific
molecules or signaling pathways. Thus, we hypothesized
that combination of a conventional cancer drug with the
ability to target ABCG2 would be a better approach to
treat MM patients and may improve drug-sensitivity.
In this study, we focused on CD138−CD34−cells

mice injected with CD138−CD34−CSCs exhibited a high
level of urinal protein, it is likely that injected MM cells
had significantly infiltrated into the kidney. Thus, the
mice described here would serve as a proper murine
model that reflect many pathological aspects associated
with MM. Based on this model, we have been able to
demonstrate that the combination of PTX-NPs with
ABCG2 McAb achieved a highest therapeutic response
than did any other combinations tested in this study.
Importantly, McAb-PTX-NPs showed even a stronger
efficacy than MP, which has a demonstrated curative
effect on MM [26, 27]. Thus, combination of nano-drugs
with ABCG2 McAb targeting CSCs could be ultimately
developed into a better therapy for MM.
The strong therapuetic activity of McAb-PTXNPs is apparently associated with its strong activity to
induce BMMC apoptosis. The mechanisms may involve
inhibition of ABCG2 and preventing of the internalized
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PTX from efflux out of the cells, and thereby generating a
high cytotoxicity on cells. In addtion, we guess that antiABCG2 McAb may lyse MM cells by antibody-dependent
cell-mediated toxicity and complement-dependent
cytotoxicity in mice. These possible mechanisms deserve
further investigations.
In conclusion, our data shows the targeted
therapeutic effect of McAb-NPs-PTX on MM
CD138−CD34−CSCs were demonstrated in a xenograft
MM mice. To our knowledge, this study is the first to
examine the efficacy of McAb-PTX-NPs therapy for MM
murine model established by tail vein injection of MM
CD138−CD34−cells. The findings presented provide novel
insight into the use of NPs-PTX in combination with antiABCG2 McAb directly targeting MM CD138−CD34−CSCs
and inhibiting CSC growth in vivo. The strategy may be
an effective treatment paradigm for patients with relapsed/
refractory MM.

PTX+1.2 mg/kg NPs), MP group (treated with melphalan
7.5 mg/kg and prednisone 3 mg/kg) as the positive
control, and normal group (no treatment). To test the antitumor effect of agents, 200μL of each was intravenously
injected into MM-bearing mice once a week with total
of four times 18 days after the mice were injected with
CSCs [1,  29–31]. To analyze tumorigenicity, NOD/
SCID mice were subcutaneously injected with 5 × 104
CD138−CD34−cells derived from the bone marrow of MM
patients, and tumors palpable at the injection sites were
examined after 14 days. All the animal experiments were
repeated at least twice.

CD138−cells were isolated from human MM
RPMI 8226 cells or BMMCs from MM patients using
mouse anti-human CD138 and anti-human CD34
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) followed by
immune magnetic activated cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec,
Germany) as described previously [23–25, 28, 29], and the
positive rate of CD138−CD34−cells checked by FACS was
about 95% (data not shown).

Establishment of a MM xenograft model
NOD/SCID mice were injected with 1 × 107 MM
CD138−CD34− cells through tail veins. Eighteen days
after injection, urine protein was collected by using
a mouse metabolic cage and measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Micro-computer
tomography (Micro-CT) scanning and ultrasonography
were used to examine bone lesions and renal damages
in mice. MM-bearing mice were randomly divided into
eight groups of equal size (3 mice), including model group
(mice treated with PBS), NPs group (treated with 1.2
mg/kg Fe3O4 NPs), McAb group (treated with 0.5 mg/kg
anti-ABCG2 McAb), PTX group (treated with 4 mg/

Measurement of serum FLC, calcium, IL-6 and
urine protein and red blood cells

The bone mineral density (BMD) of the humerus
and femurs in mice was measured by in vivo Micro-CT
imaging with MCT-1108 (China) at a setting of
voltage 45 kV and electric current 80 μA [33, 34].
The peak systolic BFV of renal artery was detected by
ultrasonography with Vevo 2100 (Visualsonic, Germany).
All the measurements were performed once a week with
total of four times [35].
