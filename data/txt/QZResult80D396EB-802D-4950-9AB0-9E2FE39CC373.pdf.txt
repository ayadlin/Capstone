Abstract
Malignant gliomas remain aggressive and lethal primary brain tumors in adults.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in the
most common malignant glioma, glioblastoma (GBM), and represents an important
therapeutic target. GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) present in tumors are felt to be
highly tumorigenic and responsible for tumor recurrence. Multifunctional magnetic
iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) can be directly imaged by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and designed to therapeutically target cancer cells. The targeting
effects of IONPs conjugated to the EGFR inhibitor, cetuximab (cetuximab-IONPs),
were determined with EGFR- and EGFRvIII-expressing human GBM neurospheres and
GSCs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cetuximab-IONP GBM cell binding
and internalization. Fluorescence microscopy and Prussian blue staining showed
increased uptake of cetuximab-IONPs by EGFR- as well as EGFRvIII-expressing
GSCs and neurospheres in comparison to cetuximab or free IONPs. Treatment with
cetuximab-IONPs resulted in a significant antitumor effect that was greater than
with cetuximab alone due to more efficient, CD133-independent cellular targeting
and uptake, EGFR signaling alterations, EGFR internalization, and apoptosis induction
in EGFR-expressing GSCs and neurospheres. A significant increase in survival was
found after cetuximab-IONP convection-enhanced delivery treatment of 3 intracranial
rodent GBM models employing human EGFR-expressing GBM xenografts.

INTRODUCTION

initiation, progression, and re-growth after chemoradiation
[5, 6], as well as supporting tumor vessel growth and
function [7]. GSCs are considered a relevant target for
therapy of GBM [8]. Expression of various cell surface
markers on GSCs have been reported, including CD133
[9], SSEA1 [10], and CD44 [11]. CD133-positive
populations, isolated from human GBM surgical samples,
have been shown to initiate the growth of GBM tumors
in vivo that recapitulate human tumors [9]. CD133positive human GBM cells secrete a high level of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which can contribute to
their tumor-initiating capacity [12].
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),

Malignant gliomas remain a deadly form of
brain cancer with a poor prognosis despite surgery,
chemotherapy, and ionizing radiation [1]. The most
common malignant glioma, known as glioblastoma
(GBM), is characterized by necrosis, hypoxia, and
extensive angiogenesis [2]. Highly invasive GBM cells are
known to infiltrate the surrounding normal brain, making
complete resection impossible [3, 4]. There is a clear need
for more effective strategies for the treatment of GBM.

models of human GBM.

including the EGFRvIII deletion mutant, is overexpressed
in the majority of GBM tumors and represents a major
target for treatment of these tumors [13, 14]. The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has shown that the high
level of EGFR expression correlates with EGFR gene
amplification [15, 16] and indicates a poor prognosis in
GBM patients [17]. EGFR has been used for targeting
GSCs previously [18, 19]. Cetuximab (Erbitux; ImClone
Inc.), a 152 kDa chimeric monoclonal antibody of the
immunoglobulin G1 subclass that binds to the extracellular
domain of the human EGFR [20], has been used to treat
GBM [21]. Targeting of both the wild-type (wt) EGFR and
the EGFRvIII deletion mutant is possible with cetuximab
[22, 23]. Cetuximab was found to have an inhibitory effect
against GBM cell lines and in vivo when systemically
administered in xenograft mouse models [21, 22, 24, 25].
The use of cetuximab for GBM patients has been limited
due to its larger size and difficulty crossing the blood brain
barrier (BBB) similar to other anti-EGFR antibodies [23,
26-28]. Cetuximab has also been evaluated preclinically in
a rodent glioma model alone [29], as a delivery agent for
methotrexate [30], and boron neutron capture therapy after
intratumoral convection-enhanced delivery (CED) [31].
Magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are
becoming an increasingly versatile and potent tool in
modern medicine. They can be used for clinical detection
by direct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their
strong hypointense T2 weighted signal (T2WI) [32]. They
also offer the ability to attach tumor-specific biomolecules
to their biocompatible surface for tumor targeting [3335]. To reduce nonspecific interactions of IONPs with
cells, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating can be used
to modify the nanoparticle surface [36, 37]. CED is a
method for delivering therapeutic agents directly to brain
tumors by avoiding the BBB. CED permits distribution
of molecules through the brain interstitial spaces by a
pressure gradient applied through a catheter implanted in
the brain [38]. Direct delivery into the brain can provide
higher concentrations of therapeutic agents in and around
brain tumors while minimizing systemic toxic effects.
The main objective of this study was to investigate
the therapeutic targeting effect of cetuximab-IONPs
against EGFR- and EGFRvIII-expressing GSCs in
addition to GBM tumor non-stem cells. Compared to
cetuximab alone, our data support the findings of increased
binding by cetuximab-IONPs to EGFR- and EGFRvIIIexpressing GBM cells, including GSCs. Greater binding
of cetuximab-IONPs and EGFR inhibition results in
downstream EGFR cell signaling aberrations. We have
also found greater intracellular presence of cetuximabIONPs and greater translocation of EGFR into the
cytoplasm, specifically the cytoskeletal fraction of cells.
In combination, greater binding to EGFR, inhibition of
EGFR, as well as internalization of the cetuximab-IONPs
and EGFR trigger apoptosis in human EGFR-expressing
GBM cells including GSCs. The targeted therapy of

RESULTS
EGFR and stem cell markers expression in human
GSCs-containing GBM neurospheres
GBM neurospheres are pathologically relevant
models that stably maintain genomic changes of the
primary tumor, exhibit stem-like tumor properties, and
recapitulate the invasive behavior of GBM [39]. Early
passage neurospheres derived from fresh human surgical
specimens of eight GBM patients were analyzed for
wtEGFR overexpression or expression of the EGFRvIII
deletion mutant. Western blotting confirmed that, relative
to normal astrocytes, all neurosphere cultures express
higher levels of wtEGFR and that these levels varied in the
neurosphere set: N08-30 displayed strong, N08-74, N081002, N09-30, N09-33, N09-20 and N09-21 intermediate,
and N09-32 weak EGFR expression. Only the N08-30
neurospheres were positive for both wtEGFR and the
EGFRvIII mutant (Supplementary Figure S1A, top).
The ability of GBM neurospheres to maintain wtEGFR
expression after in vitro passaging was confirmed by
higher expression of wtEGFR in GBM neurospheres
compared to normal human astrocytes (Supplementary
Figure S1A, bottom) and neural human progenitor
cells (NHPC) (Supplementary Figure S1B). In all other
experiments, however, neurospheres in early passage
were used. Neurospheres N08-74, N08-1002, N0830, N09-30, N09-32, and N09-33 were positive for the
stem cell marker CD133, N08-30 and N09-32 displaying
very strong expression (Supplementary Figure S1C). All
neurospheres were positive for stem cell markers nestin,
Nanog, and Sox-2, except for N08-21, which was positive
only for nestin and Nanog. N09-20 had a low level of
Sox2 (Supplementary Figure S1D). Expression of the stem
cell marker CD133 in GBM neurospheres was further
characterized by Flow cytometry (FACS) (Supplementary
Figure S2A).
For further studies, we chose the EGFRvIII/
wtEGFR-positive N08-30 and the wtEGFR-positive N0874 and N08-1002 neurospheres.

medium supplemented with 10% FCS, neurospheres
became positive for glial (GFAP) and neuronal (Tuj 1)
differentiation markers (Supplementary Figure S2C). At
the same time, no or significantly decreased expression
of the neuronal marker Olig 2 and the stem cell marker
CD133 was observed (Supplementary Figure S2D).

electrophoresis (Figure 1A, right). Briefly, for antibody
conjugation, activation of the carboxyl groups on the
IONPs was performed in an activation buffer containing
ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) and
NHS (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide). Conjugation of
IONPs to amino groups of cetuximab, human IgG, and
EGFRvIII antibodies was carried out at an approximate
1 : 1 (IONPs : antibody) molar ratio. Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) analysis revealed that the mean diameters
of the cetuximab-IONPs, EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs, and free
IONPs were 19, 21, and 11 nm, respectively (Figure

of EGFR in the presence of cetuximab-IONPs. Total ERK 44/42 was used as an internal control.

EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs, and free IONPs were -21.5Â±1.07,
-26.2Â±1.31, and -26.0Â±0.53 mV, respectively (Figure 1B,
bottom). To evaluate the cellular uptake of the cetuximabIONPs, we performed transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and Prussian blue staining after treatment of cells.
TEM revealed uptake of cetuximab-IONPs by GBM
neurospheres N08-74 and N08-1002. Nanoparticles
were found freely within the cytosol and in endosomes,
suggesting endocytosis of the cetuximab-IONPs (Figure
1C, top). To assess the targeting effect by cell binding,
we compared Prussian blue staining of GBM neurospheres
N08-30 incubated with IONPs and cetuximab-IONPs for
24 hs. Data in Figure 1C, bottom confirm the highest
uptake of cetuximab-IONPs, suggesting improved
internalization of cetuximab-IONPs compared to IONPs.
Markedly decreased phosphorylation of Y1068, one of the
major autophosphorylation sites on EGFR, in cetuximab-

on EGFR signaling in GBM neurospheres.

Cytotoxic effect of cetuximab-IONPs in human
GBM neurospheres in vitro
Cetuximab was previously reported to elicit
significant cytotoxicity and increased apoptosis in GBM
cell lines with EGFR amplification [21]. We tested
the effect of cetuximab-IONPs on the growth of GBM
neurospheres with varying levels of EGFR expression.
Neurospheres N08-74, N08-30, and N08-1002 were
incubated with free IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), cetuximabIONPs (0.2 mg/ml), and cetuximab (50 Âµg/ml) alone for
24, 48, and 72 hs (50 Âµg/ml cetuximab was used since

quantification by an MTT assay. (A) Neurospheres N08-74, N08-30, and N08-1002 (3x104 cells per well) and normal brain cells

(NB, 5x103) were treated with free IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), cetuximab-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), control vehicle, or cetuximab alone (50 Âµg/ml) and
MTT assay was performed after 24, 48, and 72 hs (GBM neurospheres) or 72 hs (normal brain cells). A significant decrease in cell survival
was observed in GBM neurospheres treated with cetuximab-IONPs for 72 hs (P<0.001). No cytotoxicity was observed in normal brain
cells after 72 hs. (B) Neurospheres N08-30 were treated with 0.2 mg/ml cetuximab-IONPs or IgG-IONPs for 72 hs when an MTT assay
was performed. Only cetuximab-IONPs displayed increased cytotoxicity (P<0.001). (C) U87MGwtEGFR cells (5x103) were treated with
hIgG-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), cetuximab-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), control vehicle, or cetuximab alone (50 Âµg/ml) for 144 hs. A significant decrease
in cell survival was found in U87MGwtEGFR GBM cell treated with the cetuximab-IONPs (P<0.001). In all experiments, neurospheres
and other cells were used in early passage.

in the conjugation reaction we used 1 : 1 molar ratio,
equivalent to 4 Âµg IONPs : 1 Âµg cetuximab). Cells from
adult normal human brain (NB) were used as a control.
A cell proliferation and viability assay was performed
after each time point. In this assay, the absorbance of
control (untreated neurospheres) cells is considered as
100% of live cells and the absorbance of treated cells
is proportionate to that of the control cells. Absorbance
was corrected by subtracting the background (IONPs in
media, or media only, respectively). Cetuximab-IONPs
significantly decreased cell survival in all neurospheres
tested, most prominently after 72 h treatment (P<0.001)

whereas cetuximab alone had a modest effect on
neurosphere cell viability. Due to nonspecific uptake,
free IONPs also compromised cell survival in N08-74
neurospheres, but much less efficiently than cetuximabIONPs. None of the treatments was toxic to human
astrocytes (data not shown) and NB cells after 72 hs
(Figure 2A). In contrast to hIgG-IONPs, cetuximab-IONPs
decreased viability of N08-30 GBM neurospheres (Figure
2B) and in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).
These results confirm that the conjugation of cetuximab to
IONPs is crucial for enhanced cytotoxicity of cetuximabIONPs against all GBM neurospheres. As an additional

EGFR to the cytoskeletal structures. Neurospheres were treated with free IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), cetuximab-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), control
vehicle, or cetuximab alone (50 Âµg/ml) and expression of apoptotic proteins was evaluated by Western blotting. Elevated levels of cleaved
caspase 3 and cleaved PARP were found in neurospheres N08-74 and N08-30 after treatment with cetuximab-IONPs for 3 (A, left) and
in neurospheres N08-74 for 14 hs (A, right). Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs was most effective in inducing cleavage of caspase 3 and
PARP although some caspase 3 cleavage was also induced by free IONPs in N08-30. In neurospheres N08-1002, induction of caspase 3
and PARP cleavage, and decreased phosphorylation of ERK 44/42 was found after 3 h treatment with cetuximab-IONPs and cetuximab
alone, both in the presence and absence of EGF and FGF, caspase 3 was used as a control (B, top). Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs (but
not the control conjugated antibody) increased cleavage of PARP in neurospheres N08-1002 whereas no cleavage was observed in NHPC
(B, bottom). (C) N08-30 neurospheres were treated as above for 5 hs, lysates were subcellularly fractionated, and analyzed by Western
blotting. Elevated levels of wtEGFR were found in the cytoskeletal fraction after cells were treated with cetuximab-IONPs. (D) U87MG
and U87MGwtEGFR human GBM cell lines were treated with free IONPs, cetuximab-IONPs, or cetuximab alone. Apoptosis, as indicated
by activation of caspase 3 cleavage, was seen only in the U87MGwtEGFR cell line treated with cetuximab-IONPs.

control, cetuximab-IONP treatment induced increased
translocation of wtEGFR to the lysosomes (data not
shown), suggesting increased lysosomal degradation of
EGFR in the presence cetuximab-IONPs. In U87MG cells,
cetuximab-IONP treatment resulted in elevated levels of
cleaved caspase 3 only in U87MGwtEGFR cells but not in
the parental U87MG cell line with basal level of wtEGFR
(Figure 3D). These data highlight the necessity of EGFR
for biological activity of the cetuximab-IONPs.
In summary, these data demonstrate that cetuximabIONPs specifically induce increased apoptosis in GBM
neurospheres and cell lines in comparison to NHPC, and
promote traslocation of wtEGFR predominantly to the
cytoskeletal fraction within cells.

control, we used the GBM cell line U87MGwtEGFR
(overexpressing wtEGFR). Treatment with hIgG-IONPs,
cetuximab-IONPs, control vehicle, or cetuximab for
144 hs resulted in significantly decreased survival only
in cells treated with cetuximab-IONPs (Figure 2C). In
the parental cell line U87MG with low basal wtEGFR
expression, the cytotoxic effect of cetuximab-IONPs was
about 6x lower than in U87MGwtEGFR (data not shown).
Together, these results indicate a significant and selective
EGFR-dependent cytotoxic effect of cetuximab-IONPs on
the growth of GBM neurospheres and cell lines and no
toxicity with normal brain cells.

EGFR profile and characterization of human
GSCs in vitro and in vivo

Next, we examined the mechanism of cytotoxicity
of the cetuximab-IONPs to GBM neurospheres, focusing
on apoptosis and autophagy as putative mechanisms of
cell death. In human GBM neurospheres N08-74, N08-30,
and N08-1002, none of the treatments induced conversion
of LC3B-I to LCB3-II, the hallmark of autophagy (data
not shown), suggesting that autophagy is not a likely
mode of cell death. In contrast, treatment with cetuximabIONPs resulted in elevated levels of cleaved caspase
3 and cleaved PARP in GBM neurospheres N08-74,
without any cleavage observed in cells treated with free
IONPs and cetuximab for 3 hs (Figure 3A, left). After
a 14 h incubation, induction of caspase 3 cleavage was
even more pronounced (Figure 3A, right). In neurospheres
N08-30, treatment with cetuximab-IONPs also resulted in
elevated levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3.
Free IONPs also increased caspase 3 cleavage (Figure 3A,
left), most likely due to nonspecific uptake as evidenced
in Figure 1C, bottom. On the other hand, in neurospheres
N08-1002, both cetuximab-IONPs and cetuximab alone
caused apoptosis through cleavage of PARP and caspase
3. Cetuximab-IONPs and cetuximab alone inhibited
phosphorylation of Y1068 in EGFR in N08-74 (data not
shown). A concomitant decrease in phospho-ERK44/42
levels was also observed in the presence/absence of
EGF and FGF (Figure 3B, top) (cetuximab has up to
10-fold higher affinity for EGFR than the EGF and can
thus competitively inhibit EGF binding to the receptor
[41]). When comparing GBM neurospheres N08-1002
and NHPC, elevated PARP cleavage was observed
only in neurospheres treated with cetuximab-IONPs
(Figure 3B, bottom). Consistently, U0126 (inhibitor
of the ERK pathway) also increased PARP cleavage
in cetuximab-IONP-treated cells (data not shown). By
subcellular protein fractionation we found that treatment
with cetuximab-IONPs for 2 (data not shown) and 5 hs
promoted translocation of wtEGFR to the cytoplasmic
(data not shown) and predominantly to the cytoskeletal
fraction (Figure 3C, 60-fold increase over control as
indicated by densitometric analysis). Compared with

Utilizing FACS analysis, we isolated CD133positive GSCs cells from GBM neurospheres N08-74,
N08-30 (Figure 4A), and N08-1002 (data not shown).
Renewal capacity and multi-lineage differentiation ability
of GSCs were confirmed (data not shown). GSCs (104)
from all tested neurospheres (N08-74, N08-30, and
N08-1002) were tumorigenic in athymic nude mice and
intracranial GBM xenografts were confirmed by both
MRI and histological examination. Expression of both
wtEGFR and EGFRvIII in vivo was demonstrated by
immunohistochemistry (Figure 4B). Mice inoculated with
N08-30 CD133-negative cells (10x more than GSCs) also
developed invasive intracranial tumors at a later point
(data not shown). Interestingly, GSCs from neurospheres
N08-74 and N08-1002 expressed higher levels of wtEGFR
than CD133-negative cells, whereas CD133 status had no
effect on wtEGFR and EGFRvIII expression in fractions
isolated from neurospheres N08-30 (Figure 4C).

GSCs bind and internalize cetuximab-IONPs
Internalization of cetuximab-IONPs in CD133positive N08-74 and N08-30 GSCs in vitro was confirmed
by Prussian blue staining at 24 hs (Figure 4D). These
data confirm again that the cetuximab-IONPs were most
efficiently taken up by the N08-74 GSCs and N08-30
GSCs, suggesting improved internalization of cetuximabIONPs compared to free IONPs. In addition, confocal
microscopy of N08-74 GSCs and N08-30 GSCs (data
not shown) treated with Cy5.5-conjugated cetuximab
or cetuximab-IONPs for 4 hs was performed. The ratio
of pseudo-red (Cy5.5) to pseudo-blue (DAPI) signals
confirmed more efficient internalization of cetuximabIONPs-Cy5.5 compared with cetuximab-Cy5.5 alone (7x
higher in the former, Figure 4E).

GBM CD133-negative cells (except N08-1002) after 72
hs (Figure 5A, B) (P<0.001). Treatment with cetuximab
alone also resulted in decreased cell survival in N0874, N08-30, and N08-1002 GSCs and in N08-74, N0830 GBM CD133-negative cells, albeit not as efficient as
with the cetuximab-IONPs (Figure 5A, B). None of the
treatments affected NHPC treated for 24, 48 (data not
shown), and 72 hs (Figure 5C). Increasing concentration
of cetuximab to 0.2 and 0.5 mg/ml did not significantly
decrease viability of N08-74 GSCs after 72 hs (data not
shown). These data confirm a significant cytotoxic effect
of cetuximab-IONPs on human GSCs and, to a lesser
degree, on the GBM CD133-negative population of cells.

We also investigated the effect of cetuximab-IONPs
on the growth of human GSCs. GSCs and GBM CD133negative cells from N08-74, N08-30 (Figure 5A), and
N08-1002 neurospheres with varying levels of EGFR
expression (Figure 5B), were treated with free IONPs,
cetuximab-IONPs, and cetuximab for 24, 48, and 72 hs.
CD133 positivity of GSCs on the day of the experiment
was verified by Western blot (data not shown). Cell
proliferation and survival assays revealed that cetuximabIONPs most efficiently decreased survival of GSCs and

Cetuximab-IONPs induce apoptosis in human
GSCs and tumor non-stem cells

(Figure 6B).
Drug-treated cancer cells can undergo apoptosis due
to activation of intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. We found
increased cleavage of caspase 9, a hallmark of activation
of intrinsic apoptosis, in N08-30 GSCs and GBM CD133negative cells treated with cetuximab-IONPs (Figure 6C).
Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs and cetuximab alone for
30 min, 1, and 3 hs inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR
Y1068 in N08-74 GSCs (data not shown). In addition,
significant inhibition of ERK44/42 phosphorylation was
observed in N08-74 GSCs, along with a more modest
effect in GBM CD133-negative cells treated for 3 hs
(Figure 6D). Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs for 72
hs showed more significant inhibition of ERK44/42
phosphorylation than treatment with cetuximab alone in
N08-74 (Figure 6E) and N08-30 (data not shown) GSCs.
Furthermore, treatment with cetuximab-IONPs and to a
lesser extent cetuximab alone dramatically decreased

Apoptosis and cleavage of caspase 3 was
investigated as a mechanism of cell death in GSCs and
GBM CD133-negative cells. Both populations from the
neurospheres N08-74 and N08-30 were incubated with
free IONPs, cetuximab-IONPs, and cetuximab alone.
Cetuximab-IONPs induced apoptosis in N08-74 GSCs and
GBM CD133-negative cells, as indicated by the presence
of cleaved PARP and caspase 3 after treatment for 3
hs (Figure 6A) and cleaved PARP after 6, 8, and 24 hs
(data not shown). We did not find any increase in cleaved
caspase 3 or PARP after treatment with free IONPs and
cetuximab alone. Only cetuximab-IONP-treated N08-30
GSCs underwent apoptosis, as shown by cleaved PARP
and caspase 3, whereas cetuximab alone had less of an
effect. In CD133-negative GBM cells from N08-30, the
opposite was observed: cetuximab alone was more potent
than cetuximab-IONPs in inducing cleavage of PARP

Human GSCs harvested from neurospheres N08-74, N08-30 (A), and N08-1002 (B) (3x104 cells per well), GBM CD133-negative cells
(3x104), and NHPC (C) were treated with free IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), cetuximab-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), control vehicle, or cetuximab (50 Âµg/
ml). MTT assay was performed after 24, 48, and 72 hs (GSCs and GBM CD133-negative cells) or 72 hs (NHPC). A significant decrease
in cell survival was found in all human GSCs treated with the cetuximab-IONPs for 72 hs (P<0.001); cetuximab-IONPs also decreased,
to a lesser degree, the survival of human GBM CD133-negative cells after 72 hs (P<0.001). No cytotoxicity was observed in NHPC cells
after 72 hs.

cetuximab-IONPs CED in multiple orthotopic
GBM rodent models

Figure S3). Similarly as in GBM neurospheres, subcellular
protein fractionation revealed that treatment of GSCs with
cetuximab-IONPs for 5 hs promoted translocation of the
wtEGFR predominantly to the cytoskeletal fraction (data
not shown).
Use of IONPs conjugated to an EGFRvIII antibody
(EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs), but not the EGFRvIIIAb alone,
induced apoptosis through cleavage of caspase 3 in
GSCs and GBM CD133-negative cells from N08-74
(Supplementary Figure S4). These results further support
the finding that targeting wtEGFR and the EGFRvIII
mutant by EGFR-antibody conjugated IONPs triggers cell
death via apoptosis in human GSCs.

Three different intracranial orthototopic GBM mouse
models were used to test the efficacy of cetuximab-IONPs
in vivo. Animal survival studies were also performed.
Human GBM xenograft tumors were established in

animals per group) were divided into 4 CED treatment
groups: cetuximab-IONPs (5Âµg), free IONPs (5Âµg,) free
cetuximab (5Âµg), and a control group (HBSS). Mice
implanted with LN229wtEGFR (7 animals per group)
were divided into 3 CED treatment groups: cetuximabIONPs (5Âµg), free cetuximab (5Âµg), and a control group
(HBSS). Before CED, MRI was performed and mice with
comparable tumor sizes were randomized into treatment
groups.
In mice implanted with the GSC-containing
neurospheres, MRI was performed prior to CED to
monitor tumor growth and initiation of CED treatment
(Figure 7A). Tumor xenografts derived from the implanted
GSC-containing neurospheres had imaging and pathologic
characteristics of infiltrating and invasive GBM tumors.
After CED of cetuximab-IONPs (day 41 after tumor
implantation), MRI on day 0 confirmed T2-weighted
signal drop and distribution of the cetuximab-IONPs (in
the brain 4.79 mm3 cetuximab-IONPs is distributed over
1.36 mm3 of tumor), T2-weighted signal drop correlated
with intra- and peri-tumoral cetuximab-IONP distribution
(black arrows) (Figure 7A, top and bottom, upper panel).
The nanoparticles were still visible on day 146 post CED,
revealing delayed clearance of the nanoparticles from

the mouse brain. Intracranial xenograft tumors were
confirmed by histopathology (Supplementary Figure
S5A, left). Prussian blue staining also confirmed intraand peri-tumoral presence of nanoparticles in the human
neurosphere xenografts (Supplementary Figure S5A,
right). Immunostaining with wtEGFR and EGFRvIII
antibodies confirmed wtEGFR and EGFRvIII expression
(Supplementary Figure S5B, left and right). Increased
levels of cleaved caspase 3 in tumors from mice treated
with cetuximab-IONPs were detected by immunostaining
(Supplementary Figure S5C) and Western blotting
confirming thus apoptosis in vivo (Supplementary Figure
S5D). Densitometric analysis of Western blot signals
indicated a 27-fold induction of caspase 3 cleavage in
cetuximab-IONP-treated xenografts (Supplementary
Figure S5E). In contrast, we did not find any increase in
cleaved caspase 3 in xenografts treated with free IONPs or
cetuximab alone (Supplementary Figure S5D, E).
Overall, mice that received CED of cetuximabIONPs survived significantly longer (median survival 164
days; P<0.005). Median survival time for control mice was
146 days (P<0.005) and in animals that underwent CED
with cetuximab only, the median survival time was 147
days (P<0.005) (Figure 7B). MRI revealed large tumors

cetuximab-IONPs significantly higher caspase 3 cleavage
was detected (data not shown).
Most importantly, in the LN229wtEGFR model,
the median survival time of mice treated with cetuximabIONPs was 73 days, two and half time longer than control
mice and mice that underwent CED with cetuximab only
with median survival times of 29 and 30 days, repectively
(P<0.005) (Figure 8D). In summary, in all three GBM
rodent models tested, CED of cetuximab-IONPs
significantly increased survival of animals with human
EGFR-expressing orthotopic tumors.

in control mice and on day 163 post tumor implantation
all control mice were dead. In contrast, in the cetuximabIONP treated group, significantly smaller tumors were
detected on days 134, 146 after CED (175 and 187 days
post implantation) (Figure 7A). Furthermore, two mice
from this treatment group were long-term survivors living
over 200 days (Figure 7B).
In the U87MGwtEGFR orthotopic model, CED
treatment was performed 5 days after implanting GBM
cells. A separate group of 4 mice was sacrificed on
day 5 and intracranial xenografts were confirmed by
histopathology (Supplementary Figure S6A). After
CED, H&E (Supplementary Figure S6B, left) and
Prussian blue staining (Supplementary Figure S6B, right)
were performed. Immunostaining confirmed wtEGFR
expression (Supplementary Figure S6C). Furthermore,
potent inhibition of EGFR Y1068 phosphorylation was
demonstrated by immunostaining (Supplementary Figure
S6D) and Western blot analysis (data not shown), whereas
levels of cleaved caspase 3 increased in the intracranial
xenografts from mice treated with the cetuximab-IONPs
(Supplementary Figure S6E).
Additionally, we monitored targeting and the
presence of nanoparticles in human GBM xenografts by
MRI (Figure 8A). MRI confirmed T2-weighted signal
drop and distribution of cetuximab-IONPs on day 0 after
CED. The T2 signal drop increased on days 8, 16, and 23,
confirming progressive dispersion of the bioconjugated
IONPs into the surrounding brain (Figure 8A, left) as
previously described [44]. Dramatic T2-weighted signal
drop within the xenograft tumor was observed in mice
that underwent cetuximab-IONP CED (Figure 8A, right,
bottom, black arrow).
In the U87MGwtEGFR model, the median survival
time of mice treated with cetuximab-IONPs was 42 days,
whereas control mice died in 31 days. Median survival
times of animals that underwent CED with free IONPs
(data not shown) and cetuximab only were 34 and 33 days,
respectively (P<0.001) (Figure 8B).
As the final orthotopic model, we employed
LN229wtEGFR GBM cells implanted 5 days prior to
CED treatment. As in previous models, targeting and the
presence of nanoparticles in xenografts was monitored by
MRI (Figure 8C). We confirmed dramatic T2-weighted
signal drop within the xenograft tumor (white arrows)
and distribution of cetuximab-IONPs on day 0 after
CED. T2 signal drop increased on days 16, 30, and 44
confirming dispersion of the bioconjugated IONPs into
the surrounding brain (Figure 8C, left, black arrow). On
day 49 post tumor implantation (44 post CED), MRI of
control mice revealed large tumors (Figure 8C, right,
lower panel), whereas significantly smaller tumors were
detected in cetuximab-IONP-treated mice (Figure 8C,
right, upper panel). Histopathology confirmed the presence
of intracranial xenograft tumors that expressed wtEGFR
and in intracranial xenografts from mice treated with the

Intracranial cetuximab-IONP toxicity evaluation
In all 3 rodent GBM models, histopathology
examination revealed no signs of toxicity in the
surrounding brain tissue where CED was performed. No
signs of inflammation, neural cell degeneration, or necrotic
cells were found in mice after CED of cetuximab-IONPs
(data not shown).
Toxicity studies, performed separately in
immunologically competent C57BL/6 mice (without
orthotopic xenografts) that underwent cetuximabIONP CED, provided no evidence of toxicity. After
cetuximab-IONP CED, there were no changes in rodent
behavior, weight loss, appearance, or neurological signs.
Furthermore, MRI showed no signs of hemorrhage,
inflammation, or edema on T2 weighted-imaging on
day 1 (Supplementary Figure S7) and day 7 (data not
shown). On histopathologic examination, no toxicity or
inflammation was evident. No neural cell degeneration or
necrotic cells were found in brains of C57BL/6 mice 14
days and 1 month post CED of cetuximab-IONPs (data
not shown).
In conclusion, these data demonstrate that
cetuximab-IONPs induce a significant increase in
survival of experimental animals implanted with highly
tumorigenic GBM xenografts in the absence of any signs
of toxicity. We provide evidence that cetuximab-IONPs
are feasible for in vivo GBM tumor targeting and have a
significant antitumor effect.

DISCUSSION
Unsatisfactory results of standard GBM therapy
have resulted in multiple efforts to search for new
therapeutic strategies. Proper delivery of therapeutic agents
and tumor targeting are important goals that will help
overcome obstacles in the treatment of primary malignant
brain tumors. GBM tumors which rarely metastasize,
and are locally invasive in the brain, represent a potential
target for loco-regional delivery strategies, such as CED
[45]. CED was developed as a tool for intracerebral drug
delivery and its utility has been demonstrated in multiple
human clinical trials [46, 47]. CED provides high local
8798

concentration of drugs in the brain with relatively uniform
distribution permitting subsequent diffusion and further
dispersion of drugs into the surrounding brain. The other
advantage of CED is the ability to concentrate therapeutic
agents into the tumor and surrounding brain tissue and
avoid systemic toxicities [48, 49].
The importance of EGFR in the malignant
progression of GBM and the effect of EGFR on patient
survival has been extensively documented. Heterogeneity
of GBM tumors with respect to in situ EGFR amplification
was previously reported in tumor cells with EGFR
amplification enriched at the invading margin of tumors
[14, 50]. EGFR has been proposed as a prospective GSC
marker [51] and targeting of EGFR by small molecules or
antibodies is therapeutically relevant [52, 53]. The CD133

marker allows identification of a clinically more aggressive
molecular subtype of GBM and is associated with a worse
outcome [54]. Newer studies provide evidence that CD133
negative cells can also be tumorigenic in a rodent model,
albeit less efficiently as CD133-positive GSCs [55].
IONPs represent a multifunctional clinical platform
that can be designed to therapeutically target cancer cells
while simultaneously be sensitively imaged by MRI. There
have been several attempts to use magnetic nanoparticles
to target GBM [33, 56]. IONPs conjugated with RGD
have been used for noninvasive monitoring and orthotopic
GBM therapy [57]. Other groups studied the effect of
curcumin-conjugated nanoparticles on GSCs in vitro [58].
The effect of TRAIL conjugated to nanoparticles in GBM
models in vitro and in vivo has also been explored [59].

The data presented do show that cetuximab-IONPs
have a significant therapeutic effect with 3 different
GBM animal models. Cetuximab-IONP CED permitted
direct imaging by MRI, revealing intra- and peritumoral
localization of the nanoparticles in three orthotopic
intracranial rodent GBM models. One of these models
is characterized by invasive xenografts grown from
patient-derived GSC-containing neurospheres and the
two other models with xenografts derived from human
GBM cell lines. No evidence of toxicity or inflammation
was found in rodents treated by the cetuximab-IONPs.
In our previous study, we reported on MRI-guided CED
of cetuximab-IONPs and demonstrated its safety and
feasibility in healthy canine patients [61]. Present studies
involved both mice with xenografts as well as healthy
immunocompetent mice. Widespread distribution of the
nanoparticles within and adjacent to xenograft tumors
was observed in all three models as evidenced by MRI
and histopathology. This suggests that cetuximab-IONPs
can potentially target the main tumor mass and infiltrating
cancer cells residing away from the tumor mass. The
survival of athymic nude mice implanted with GBM
xenografts was significantly prolonged after CED with the
cetuximab-IONPs in all three models.
In summary, we have determined that cetuximabIONPs bind to both the wtEGFR and the EGFRvIII
deletion mutant on human patient-derived GBM cells
(including GSCs), inhibit EGFR cell signaling, are
internalized by the tumor cells, and promote internalization
of the EGFR resulting in enhanced apoptosis. Treatment
with cetuximab-IONPs exerted a significant therapeutic
effect in vivo in 3 different orthotopic GBM mouse
models after CED. One of the rodent models developed
invasive intracranial human GSC xenografts from a
patient with GBM. Cetuximab-IONPs are safe, can be
visualized on standard T2 weighted MRI, are retained
in brain tumors for many weeks with no evidence of
toxicity to the surrounding brain. No toxicity to healthy
immunocompetent mice was observed after CED of
cetuximab-IONPs. We have thus provided a proof of
principle that GSCs and GBM tumors can be targeted with
cetuximab-conjugated IONPs and established the basis for
a future human clinical trial for patients with GBM.

We have previously described the conjugation of a purified
EGFRvIII antibody to amphiphilic triblock copolymercoated IONPs for the imaging and treatment of GBM [44].
In this study, we are the first to report that IONPs
bioconjugated to the chimeric monoclonal EGFR
antibody, cetuximab, have a much greater therapeutic
effect against GBM than cetuximab alone. In side-by-side
comparisons, cetuximab-IONPs were more effective than
cetuximab alone and offered significantly increased tumor
cell toxicity in vitro against human GBM neurospheres,
GSCs, and GBM CD133-negative cells expressing various
levels of wtEGFR. The significant in vitro effect was
also observed in human GBM neurospheres, GSCs, and
CD133-negative tumor cells which also expressed the
EGFRvIII deletion mutant.
Potential mechanisms responsible for the cytotoxic
effect of cetuximab-IONPs against different types of GBM
cells include increased apoptosis through activation of the
intrinsic pathway resulting in elevated cleaved caspase 3
levels. We have also found EGFR signaling alterations,
as indicated by significant inhibition of ERK44/42
phosphorylation in GSCs treated with cetuximab-IONPs.
We have determined the cetuximab-IONPs bind to both
the wtEGFR and the EGFRvIII deletion mutant, are
internalized by the tumor cells, and that conjugation
with IONPs enhances internalization. We believe when
internalized, cetuximab-IONPs accumulate and a proapoptotic signal is triggered, as the consequence of EGFR
signaling dysregulation, through cleavage of caspase 9,
followed by cleavage of caspase 3 that eventually causes
cancer cell death. Although the pro-apoptotic effect of
EGFR-targeting therapies has been described previously,
cetuximab elicited a pro-apoptotic effect only in GBM
cell lines with EGFR amplification [21]. Moreover, in a
subcellular fractionation experiment, we were able to show
transport of EGFR to the cytoplasm, predominantly to the
cytoskeletal fraction. This suggests increased endocytosis
and degradation of EGFR in cells treated with cetuximabIONPs.
Our data suggest that cetuximab conjugation to
IONPs amplifies the biological effect of cetuximab and
cetuximab-IONPs are effective against GBM cells with
varying levels of EGFR expression. Cetuximab in the
cetuximab-IONPs complex performs a dual function: by
targeting EGFR, it not only inhibits the EGFR signaling
pathway but also facilitates attachment of the IONPs
onto the GBM cell surface. The reason for the higher
cytotoxicity of cetuximab-IONPs may be greater uptake,
compared to free IONPs and cetuximab alone, by GBM
cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This results
in a higher concentration of intracellular IONPs that
eventually trigger apoptosis[60].
Furthermore, we have found that treatment of
GSCs with cetuximab-IONPs dramatically decreases
the expression of the GSC markers CD133 and Sox2,
providing further support for targeting of GSCs.

was cultured in DMEM/F12 (50/50 mix, Cellgro) and
10% FCS (HyClone) in the presence of sodium pyruvate,
Penstrep, and L-glutamine (HyClone). Cell lines were
used for fewer than 6 months after resuscitation and
were routinely tested for Mycoplasma, no genotypic
authentication was conducted. Each cell line was used in
early passage.

carboxyl groups on the IONPs were activated in an
activation buffer (provided by the manufacturer)
containing ethyl dimethylaminoprolyl carbodiimide
(EDC) and sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Briefly,
IONPs were mixed vigorously with the EDC/NHS
solution at 25Â°C for 20 min, the IONPs with activated
carboxyl groups (100 Î¼l at 5 mg/ml) were then reacted
with cetuximab, EGFRvIII antibody, or human IgG (62.5
Î¼l at 2 mg/ml) at 25Â°C for 2 hs and the reaction mixtures
were stored at 4Â°C overnight. Unreacted antibody was
removed by three rounds of centrifugation using 300K
MWCO OMEGA membranes, followed by resuspending
IONPs in PBS. Conjugation was visualized using mobility
shift in 1% agarose gel. The number of antibody molecules
conjugated to IONPs was determined by Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Human GBM neurospheres
Tumor specimens were collected from patients
with a histologic diagnosis of GBM (WHO Grade IV
astrocytoma). Confirmation of tumor diagnosis and
grading was performed by neuro-pathologists at Emory
University. Patient tumor specimens (patients # N08-74,
N08-1002, N08-30, N09-30, N09-32, N09-33, N09-20,
N09-21) were harvested at the time of surgical resection
with approval by the Emory University Institutional
Review Board (IRB) (protocol 642-2005). Tissues were
minced with a scalpel, fragments were digested for 30
min at 37Â°C with 1 mg/ml collagenase/Dispase (Roche)
and separated by Ficoll gradient. GBM neurospheres were
cultured in a Neurobasal A-medium with N-2 and B-27
supplements (Invitrogen), 10 ng/ml human recombinant
bFGF and 20 ng/ml EGF (both STEMCELL Technologies)
at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. Neurospheres were used in early

Measurements were performed at 25Â°C.

Subcellular Fractionation
GBM neurospheres N08-30 (single cell suspensions,
2x106 cells/6-well plate) were treated with control IgG,
IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), cetuximab-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), and
cetuximab (50 Âµg/ml) for indicated time. Subcellular
fractions were separated with the Subcellular Protein
Fractionation kit for Cultured cells (Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

Isolation of human GBM CD133-positive cells
using FACS
Neurospheres were dissociated using Accutase
(Chemicon), single cell suspensions of 1 - 8 x 107 cells
were stained with anti-CD133 /1 (AC133)- phycoerythrin
(PE)-coupled antibody (Miltenyi Biotech) and sorted using
FACS Vantage SE (Becton Dickinson). In all experiments,
human GBM CD133-positive and negative cells were used
in early passage.

Transmission electron microscopy
Single cell suspensions of neurospheres (5x104 cells)
were incubated with cetuximab-IONPs, and IONPs (all 0.2

Cy5.5 was conjugated to cetuximab and cetuximabIONPs with EasyLink APC/Cy5.5 conjugation kit (Abcam,
MA, USA). Single-cell suspensions of N08-74 GSCs (2
x104 /8 well chamber slide) were treated with cetuximabIONPs-Cy5.5 (0.2 mg/ml) and cetuximab-Cy5.5 (50 Âµg/
ml) for 4 hs, fixed, and imaged using Zeiss LSM 510 Meta
Confocal microscope. Quantification was performed using
Zen 2011 Light Edition. Experiments were conducted in
triplicates.

Tumor inoculation and CED
Anesthetized athymic nude mice were placed in
a stereotactic instrument and GBM neurospheres N0830 (1x106 cells resuspended in Neurobasal medium,
5 Âµl), U87MGwtEGFR and LN229wtEGFR GBM
cells (5x105 resuspended in DMEM, 5 Âµl) in were
stereotactically inoculated 1 mm posterior to the coronal
suture, 3 mm to the right to the midline and 3 mm below
the cortical surface into the right striatum (day 0). On
day 5 after tumor implantation (U87MGwtEGFR and
LN229wtEGFR) and day 41 (N08-30), mice were
randomized into four groups (7 in each group using GBM
neurospheres N08-30 and GBM LN229wtEGFR cell line
and 10 using GBM U87MGwtEGFR cell line) for CED
of: a) untreated control; b) free IONPs; c) cetuximab only;
and d) cetuximab-IONPs. The CED infusion apparatus
consisted of a hydraulic drive serially connected to a
digital syringe pump controller (UltraMicroPumpII,
World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, Florida) and
was used according to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction. For
CED a Hamilton syringe with a 22 gauge, 51 mm needle
was used. The needle was inserted through the same skull
opening used for tumor cell injection with the pressure
8720 kPa. It was performed with 5 Î¼g total dosage in a 10
Î¼l volume (0.5 mg/ml) at a rate of 0.5 Î¼l/min (20 min of
total infusion) in the right striatum (0.624 Î¼g Fe/cetuximab
per 1mm3 of tumor).

Cell viability assay (MTT)
Toxicity experiments were performed on GBM
neurospheres, GSCs (CD133-positive), CD133-negative
tumor cells (3x104 cells), primary culture from normal
human brain, NHPC, and U87MGwtEGFR (5x103
cells). Cells were seeded in triplicate on 96-well plates
and treated with IONPs, hIgG-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml),
cetuximab-IONPs, and cetuximab alone for 24, 48, and
72 hs (neurospheres), 72 hs (normal human brain cells and
NHPC), and 144 hs (U87MGwtEGFR cells). Cell viability
was determined by an MTT Cell Proliferation Assay kit
(Roche). All absorbances were in the linear range and
corrected by subtracting the background. Experiments
were conducted in triplicates.

Western blot analysis
GBM neurospheres, GSCs, CD133-negative tumor
cells, and human GBM cell lines (single cell suspensions,
3.5x105 cells/6-well plate) were treated with control
IgG, IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), hIgG-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml),
cetuximab-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs
(0.2 mg/ml), cetuximab (50 Âµg/ml), and EGFRvIIIAb
(50 Âµg/ml) for indicated time. Cells were centrifuged at
4000 rpm for 5 min, lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation
buffer (RIPA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5
mM EDTA, and 1% NP40 with protease and phoshatase
inhibitors (Roche)) and protein concentrations were
determined using Bio-Rad protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad).
Conditions for Western blotting were per manufacturersâ€™
recommendations. Primary antibodies used were:
mouse anti-Î²-actin (1:1000, Sigma); rabbit anti-cleaved

Intracranial toxicity studies of cetuximab-IONPs
For toxicity studies in C57BL/6-cBrd/cBrd/Cr mice,
CED was performed as described above with the 5Î¼g total
dosage in a 10 Î¼l volume (0.5 mg/ml) at a rate of 0.5 Î¼l/
min (20 min of total infusion) in the right striatum.

Anesthetized mice underwent MRI scanning on a
4.7-T animal MRI scanner using a dedicated mouse coil
(Varian Unity). T2 weighted fast spin echo sequences with
TR/TE=6500/70 ms were typically used for imaging of the
tumor and IONPs in the brain.

Histology

Authorsâ€™ contributions

The brains of mice implanted with tumors were
harvested and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin.
Axial sections were made at the level of the needle tract
to mark the center of xenografted tumors. Tissue blocks
were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and mounted on
slides. Prussian blue staining was performed in a mixture
(50/50) of 5% potassium ferrocyanide and 5% HCl for 30
min at 37Â°C followed by a rinse with distilled water. For
immunohistochemistry, slides were incubated with rabbit
anti-wtEGFR (1:50, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-EGFRvIII
(1:100, GenScript Corp.), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:300,)
and anti-phospho-EGFR 1068 (1:3000, both Cell
Signaling Technology) antibodies at room temperature for
1 h and detected with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody in rabbit ABC staining system (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

Experimental design, project, and manuscript were
developed by MK and CGH; MK established neurosphere
cultures from surgical specimens and performed in vitro
experiments; MK and AB performed intracranial tumor
inoculations and CED treatments; RM helped with GBM
neurosphere cultures and animal experiments.

Animal survival studies

Editorial note

Athymic nude mice were observed daily to monitor
external appearance such as hunching, weight loss,
locomotion, and feeding behavior. Animals were sacrificed
when neurological deficits such as paresis, seizures, and
significant weight loss occurred and mouse brains were
fixed in 10% formalin.
