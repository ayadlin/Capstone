Carcinogenesis is a multistep process attributable to both gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes and loss-of-function mutations in
tumor suppressor genes. Currently, most molecular targeted therapies are inhibitors of oncogenes, because inactivated tumor suppressor genes have proven harder to “drug.” Nevertheless, in cancers, tumor suppressor genes undergo alteration more frequently
than do oncogenes. In recent years, several promising strategies directed at tumor suppressor genes, or the pathways controlled by
these genes, have emerged. Here, we describe advances in a number of different methodologies aimed at therapeutically targeting

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a genetic disease. Historically, the idea that cancer could be etiologically attributed to genetic alterations was first
recognized when cancer-causing viruses were found to be able to transform normal cells. The responsible genes within
these viruses were identified and called “oncogenes.” The existence of “antioncogenes” had also been posited, but definitive evidence was lacking for many years. In 1969, Knudson first predicted the existence of tumor suppressor genes
(TSGs), based on the kinetics of the development of sporadic and inherited retinoblastomas.1 He proposed a “2-hit”
model for carcinogenesis that was ultimately supported in 1986 with the successful cloning of the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1)
gene.2 Classically, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes will only lead to a phenotype when both copies of the gene have
been lost. In cancer, the inactivation of one copy of a TSG will generally need to be followed by loss of the remaining copy
of the gene, followed then by emergence of the tumor phenotype.
One of the early logical arguments against the existence of TSGs was that it was difficult to reconcile Knudson’s 2hit model with the model of clonal evolution of cancer as put forth by Nowell, in which cancer is the result of cells progressing through successive waves of clonal selection, with a growth advantage at each step along the way.3 The Knudson
2-hit model assumed that TSGs are recessive and that a precancerous cell would only enjoy an advantage once it loses both
functional copies of a TSG that had been suppressing growth. Given the very low spontaneous mutation rate in normal
cells (estimated at between 131026 and 13 1027 mutations per gene, per cell division), the requirement that both alleles
be lost before a cell developed a growth advantage would make such events too rare to account for the observed incidence
of human cancer.4,5 Quon and Berns proposed that a tumor requiring 4 mutations would arise at an approximate frequency of 13 10221 cells, orders of magnitude below the 1014 cells comprising the human body, a fact that appeared to
be inconsistent with the statistic that 1 of 3 individuals will develop a cancer during their lifetime.6 This led to the conclusion that there could be a phenotype associated with loss of a single copy of certain TSGs; this ultimately was shown to be
the case with some. Indeed, it is now more or less accepted that for many TSGs, heterozygous loss of function can be associated with reduced gene dosage and tumorigenesis via haploinsufficiency.6,7 Additional explanations for this question
also appeal to alternate methods by which TSGs can be silenced, such as epigenetic mechanisms, or changes in mutation
frequency, such as those that occur in hypermutator phenotypes. Together, these mechanisms begin to provide insight
into potential therapeutic approaches.
Kinzler and Vogelstein proposed that TSGs fall into 2 categories: “gatekeeper” genes and “caretaker” genes.8 Gatekeeper genes control how cells progress through cycles of growth or division, whereas caretaker genes maintain the

integrity of the genome. The distinction between these 2
classes of genes is critical to developing approaches to
therapy. Currently, nearly all molecular targeted therapies
are inhibitors of oncogenes such as kinases. Kinase inhibitors have been one of the most successful classes of cancer
drugs developed to date. Intuitively, it appears more
straightforward to inhibit a hyperactivated oncogene than
to restore the function of an inactivated TSG. Despite
their being harder to “drug,” loss-of-function alterations
in TSGs make equally important contributions to tumorigenesis. In recent years, several promising strategies
for targeting TSGs therapeutically have emerged.
Here, we describe advances in several different methodologies aimed at targeting inactivated TSGs. Although
attempts to restore TSG function have demonstrated
some potential, the most promising approaches are those
that focus on molecules that regulate, inhibit, or epigenetically silence TSGs; shut down signaling pathways
that have been abnormally activated by loss of the TSG;
or exploit vulnerabilities in cancer cells lacking certain
TSGs.
Overview of Cancer Genome Data

In cancer genomes, alterations that lead to the development of cancer tend to more commonly affect TSGs
rather than oncogenes. Early on, this was evident in exome
sequencing studies performed across multiple types of
human cancer, revealing a set of cancer “driver” genes, the
majority of which were TSGs.9,10 More recently, pancancer analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
have supported this initial finding on a broader scale, with
the majority of copy number alterations in these cancer
genome studies comprising deletions of putative TSGs.11
Zack et al have demonstrated that approximately 60% of
peak regions of copy number alteration in cancer are deletions, and the majority of genes within these peaks are either known TSGs or appear to be novel TSGs.12
Of the TSGs mutated in cancer that are deemed
most likely to be driver genes, several pathways and processes are implicated. Well-described TSGs include genes
in pathways such as Wnt/APC (adenomatous polyposis
coli gene [APC], AXIN1, and CDH1); apoptosis/cell cycle
(cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [CDKN2A], tumor
protein 53 [TP53], RB1, TRAF7,and CASP8); chromatin
modification (ARID1A/B/2, ASXL1, ATRX, CREBBP,
KDM5C, KDM6A, MEN1, MLL2/3, SETD2, ten-eleven
translocation-2 [TET2], WT1, and BAP1); DNA damage
repair (ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM], ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related [ATR], BRCA1/2, mutL homolog 1 [MLH1], and MSH2/6); hedgehog (PTCH1);
1358

Notch (FBXW7 and NOTCH1); phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) (PIK3R1, phosphatase and tensin homolog
[PTEN], and TSC1); Ras (CEBPA, von Hippel-Lindau
[VHL], and NF1); transforming growth factor-b
(SMAD2/4); and transcriptional regulation (GATA3 and
RUNX1).
Targeting p53

Mutations in p53, encoded by the TP53 gene, are the
most frequent genetic alterations in cancer.13-15 TP53 is
mutated in 30% to 50% of human cancers, with a particularly high prevalence (>50%) of mutation in types of
ovarian, lung, colorectal, head and neck, pancreatic, uterine, breast, and bladder cancer.16 p53 was initially
believed to be an oncogene, based on experiments demonstrating its transforming ability. However, these early data
were ultimately attributed to the finding that the experimental TP53 cDNA had been cloned from a tumor cell
and harbored a mutation.17 Subsequently, wild-type p53
was confirmed to suppress growth; ultimately, TP53 was
correctly classified as a TSG. It is interesting to note that
p53 exerts dominant-negative activity when mutated. In
contrast to the Knudson 2-hit model, in which mutations
are thought of as creating inactive alleles, mutated TP53 is
associated with an altered gain-of-function phenotype.18
This finding is consistent with cancer genomics data, in
which the vast majority of mutations in TP53 are missense, rather than nonsense.16
In recent years, targeting mutated p53 has been a
field characterized by intense research that is beginning to
bear fruit. TP53 is a frequently inactivated gene that represents a highly tumor-specific target. However,
“drugging” mutant p53 via the standard mechanisms used
for anticancer therapies is not straightforward because
p53 is not a cell surface protein or an enzyme, and therefore not targetable with antibodies or enzyme inhibitors.
In vivo studies have supported the desirability of reactivating p53 activity in p53-null or p53-mutant tumors, indicating that doing so is sufficient to cause tumor stability
or regression.19-22 In many cases, the transformed tumor
cells were observed to be highly responsive to restoration
of p53 activity, which often turns on an apoptosis or senescence pathway. These findings have led to interest in
finding a way to reactivate wild-type p53 in tumor cells.
In addition, radiotherapy and the majority of chemotherapy agents are more effective in the presence of a functional p53 pathway, implying that biologic approaches to
reactivating p53 could also sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

regulators. The interaction between MDM2 and p53 is targeted by nutlin (which binds MDM2) or RITA (which binds

The main approaches to targeting p53 in cancer
include targeting molecules that posttranslationally regulate, inhibit, or mediate the downstream effects of p53;
reintroducing wild-type p53; or selectively killing p53mutant cancer cells.
p53: Targeting its Regulators

Several compounds have been identified that affect p53
posttranslational modification. These agents include
tenovin-1 and tenovin-6, which are now known to inhibit
the protein deacetylation activities of sirtuins. Inhibiting
these processes leads to acetylated, and thereby stabilized,
p53.23 Another class of molecules are nuclear export
inhibitors such as leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the nuclear export protein CRM1, which is able to increase local
p53 protein levels.24
The protein MDM2 (mouse double minute 2 homolog) is a negative regulator of p53. Several compounds have
been developed to specifically target protein-protein interactions between p53 and MDM2. The first molecule in
this category is nutlin, which has been identified in several
large in vitro biochemical screens as a molecule that inhibits
interaction between p53 and MDM2 by occupying the
p53-binding pocket.25 Early preclinical data have demonstrated that these agents have activity against tumors in
vivo, and research has now advanced to several clinical trials

in which nutlin in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted therapies.26 Several additional molecules
have been developed to target the N-terminal interaction
between p53 and MDM2 or MDMX. There is now known
to be a deep hydrophobic cleft in MDM2 into which p53
is embedded, a potentially “druggable” pocket.27,28 There
are now orally bioavailable molecules with submolar affinity for MDM2 in phase 1 studies. These compounds
increase p53 levels, as well as the levels of the p53 target
genes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A),
MDM2, and PUMA (BBC3), in cancer cells.29 Complete
tumor regression has been achieved with several of these
compounds in preclinical studies. Of particular interest,
these compounds appear to have very little toxicity in normal cells. As used, many of these compounds are only present in the cells for a brief time but long enough to induce a
pulse of p53 activity. It is important to note that only a subset of tumors have upregulated MDM2; although up to
30% of sarcomas harbor MDM2 gene amplification, this is
far less prevalent in other cancer types. In addition, nutlin
has been demonstrated to select for certain p53-mutated
cells, which can accumulate and lead to drug resistance.30
Several newer, second-generation compounds may be able
to overcome this limitation, and are currently in phase 1 trials.31 Another recent approach is restoring p53 function
using molecules that stabilize the protein as chaperones.
For example, the molecule PRIMA-1 is a small molecule
that restores the wild-type conformation of certain mutant
p53 proteins by incompletely understood mechanisms,
and has recently completed phase 1 clinical trials.32 Several
of these approaches to targeting p53 are depicted in
Figure 1.
p53: Gene Therapy Approaches

Gene therapy approaches to p53 functional restoration
have been an area of investigation for years. The rationale
behind gene replacement therapy strategies is to use a viral
vector, such as a replication-deficient adenovirus, to introduce wild-type p53 into cancer cells. These viral vectors
can be administered intratumorally or into body cavities
(eg, intraperitoneally or intravesically). The toxicity to
normal cells of such an approach would theoretically be
minimal, because the introduction of a TSG into a normal cell at physiologic levels would not be expected to
have any significant effect. In early-phase clinical trials,
this therapy has been well tolerated by patients with minimal toxicity. Unfortunately, the major limitation to this
approach has been efficacy. The viral vectors used for gene
therapy have not been able to achieve the necessary efficiency of transduction of p53 within tumors to be

curative.33,34 Furthermore, repeat administration is hampered by host immune reactions to the virus vectors.
Therefore, an alternative approach has been to use
tumor-specific replication-competent oncolytic viruses.
An example of this is an adenovirus in which a 55kilodalton gene in the E1B region of the virus, which normally binds and inactivates p53, has been attenuated. As a
result, the virus can only replicate within (and kill) cells
lacking functional p53, and cannot survive in normal cells
with functional p53.35,36 This approach has also been
explored in numerous clinical trials and, although generally safe, has had varying levels of efficacy, most likely due
to low efficiency of delivery and nonspecific expression.37,38 This agent did not advance through phase 3 trials in the United States, but has been approved in China
1360

for use in combination with chemotherapy for certain
types of head and neck cancer.
p53: Moving Downstream

Several downstream mediators of the mutant p53 tumorigenic phenotype have been identified, including C-X-C
chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), cyclin G2, MYC,
TERT, p63/p73 transcription factors, and the mevalonate
pathway.13,39 This opens the possibility of targeting
downstream targets of mutated p53. For example, mutant
p53 (but not p53 loss) has been recognized to facilitate a
prometastatic phenotype in a pancreatic adenocarcinoma
model. Mutant p53 induces expression of platelet-derived
growth factor receptor-b (PDGFRb), which in turn mediates invasion and metastasis. Pharmacologic inhibition of

PDGFRb with agents such as crenolanib or imatinib was
able to significantly reduce the invasive potential of models of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.40
p53: Vaccine Approaches

The frequent mutations in p53, together with its high levels of expression, make it likely to be identified by the
immune system as a target antigen. Indeed, patients with
cancer are known to produce anti-p53 antibodies and
p53-reactive T cells. This has led to several nascent but
promising approaches using vaccines. For example, vaccines containing multiple p53 peptides are able to generate a T-helper type I response in patients, although the
responses have not yet been potent enough to be clinically
beneficial.41 More recently, vaccines derived from dendritic cells transfected with the TP53 gene have been noted
to generate stronger immune responses.42 Related
approaches use dendritic cells loaded with human leukocyte antigen class I p53 peptides, which appear to induce
changes in immune regulatory mechanisms, although a
continuing challenge is overcoming strong immune suppressive mechanisms in patients with cancer.43

Inhibiting Hyperactivated Pathways Resulting
From TSG Inactivation

In cases such as the example provided above of p53 and
PDGFRb, the TSG undergoing loss of function is part of
a broader signaling pathway, and the cancer phenotype is
mediated by hyperactivation of that pathway. In this scenario, the inactivated TSG can be therapeutically targeted
by inhibiting the relevant pathway further downstream.
An example of this paradigm is provided by PTEN, which
is one of the most commonly altered TSGs across human
malignancies. PTEN is inactivated by mutation or deletion in a significant percentage of diverse cancer types
including glioblastoma; endometrial, prostate, uterine,
and breast cancer; and melanoma.16,44,45 PTEN is a welldescribed TSG, functioning as a phosphatase that
removes the D3 phosphate from phosphatidyl (3,4,5)
tri-phosphate (PIP3). In their resting state, cells have low
levels of PIP3, which are then increased at the time of
growth factor stimulation or activation of PI3K. Loss of
PTEN leads to constitutively high levels of PIP3, which
mimics the state of growth factor stimulation of hyperactivated PI3K.46,47 Ultimately, the second messenger PIP3
goes on to activate target proteins including the kinases
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and
AKT1/2/3. AKT then phosphorylates as many as 20 progrowth targets relevant to cancer, including those activatCancer

ing the cell cycle, preventing apoptosis, and promoting
cell growth via the kinase mTOR (Fig. 2).48-51
It is believed that hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway resulting from inactivation of PTEN is,
at least in part, similar to the sequelae of oncogenic alterations elsewhere in the pathway such as epidermal growth
factor receptor amplification or mutation, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) amplification,
PIK3CA (the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of
PI3K) mutation, or AKT1/2 mutation.44,52 Accordingly,
downstream inhibition of signaling is an attractive
approach to targeting inactivated PTEN. PTEN-mutated
tumors, similar to PIK3CA-mutated tumors, appear to be
dependent on this signaling pathway for maintenance of
the transformed phenotype, and as a result are vulnerable
to inhibition of the pathway.53,54 Unfortunately, these
approaches have been limited by the complexity of feedback networks in this pathway. For example, inhibition of
mTOR with agents such as rapamycin is effective in
attenuating signaling but also relieves feedback inhibition
of other upstream components such as insulin, insulinlike growth factor receptor, HER3, and HER4, which can
then signal through other branches of the pathway such as
forkhead box O (FOXO)-dependent transcription.55,56
In vivo data have demonstrated that combined inhibition
of AKT, together with agents inhibiting HER kinases or
with inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase stabilization by
heat shock protein 90, is necessary to truly shut down signaling. These combination approaches can be effective in
promoting tumor regression, which AKT inhibition alone
is not able to achieve.56,57 The approach of targeting the
hyperactivated pathway affected by an inactivated TSG is
likely to be more complex than the simple linear models
of signal transduction pathways. Effective targeting of
PTEN mutation-driven cancers will require comprehensive dissection of the feedback networks activated by inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling, and durable therapy will
undoubtedly require combination approaches.
Synthetic Lethality: Vulnerabilities in DNA
Damage Repair

Cancer cells are reliant on intact DNA repair mechanisms
to be able to continuously divide. At the same time, many
cancers result from genetic aberrations that lead to
impaired DNA damage repair, such as mutations in the
caretaker TSGs ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and the Fanconi
anemia genes. Mutations in these TSGs are most commonly found in breast, ovarian, colorectal, and hematologic malignancies. In cancer cells with an impaired DNA
damage repair pathway, the cell becomes addicted to
1361

Review Article

Figure 3. The paradigm of synthetic lethality as exemplified by the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant breast cancers. PARP inhibitors impair the cell’s ability to repair single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs), which then progress to become doublestrand breaks (DSBs). DSBs are normally repaired via homologous recombination. However, cancer cells lacking BRCA1 or BRCA2
(BRCA1/2-/-) lose the ability to repair DSBs, leading to specific death of these cancer cells undergoing PARP inhibition. Adapted
with modifications from Polyak K, Garber J. Targeting the missing links for cancer therapy. Nat Med. 2011;17:283-284.

another DNA damage repair pathway. Synthetic lethality
refers to the principle by which secondary addictions such
as these can be exploited therapeutically, either by inhibiting the remaining vital pathway or by enhancing DNA
damage from chemotherapy.
There are 2 major pathways used for the repair of
DNA double-strand breaks: nonhomologous end joining
(NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR); and 3
major pathways used to repair single-strand breaks: base
excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair.58-61 Several important mediators of these
pathways play a role in more than one pathway; for example, the gene poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is
involved in NHEJ, HR, and BER.
BRCA1 or BRCA2 loss leads to cells being defective in
HR repair of double-strand breaks. This leads to a reliance
1362

on potentially mutagenic mechanisms such as NHEJ or
single-strand annealing. Ultimately, this results in significant genomic instability, causing a cancer predisposition.
This knowledge has led to the emergence of a synthetic lethal approach to targeting BRCA-mutated cancers. The
best known example of this approach is targeting PARP1
(and other PARPs) in cancers deficient in BRCA1 or
BRCA2. In these cells, if PARP1 is inhibited, the cell loses
its ability to repair single-strand DNA breaks via BER.
When the replication fork reaches an area with a singlestrand break, a double-strand break results. These doublestrand breaks are then unable to be repaired because of the
BRCA1/2 mutation impairing HR. As a result, the BRCAmutated cells undergo apoptosis, whereas normal cells with
intact BRCA are able to repair the double-strand DNA
lesions and survive (Fig. 3). Accordingly, PARP1 inhibition
Cancer

Therapeutic Targeting of Tumors/Morris and Chan

is theoretically specific for BRCA-mutated cells. Preclinical
data with PARP inhibitors demonstrate as high as 1000fold relative sensitivity of BRCA-mutated cells compared
to normal cells.62,63 In recent years, several clinical trials of
PARP inhibitors have been undertaken in patients with
breast and ovarian cancer and several of these are in
middle-stage to late-stage trials. An initial disappointing
phase 3 trial of the PARP1 inhibitor iniparib has been
attributed to the relatively low on-target potency of this
particular agent, and there remains considerable interest in
other PARP inhibitors.64,65 Because radiotherapy causes
double-strand DNA breaks, there is also considerable interest in combining radiation with PARP inhibitors for
patients with tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations.66
The list of potential candidates for a synthetic lethal
approach most likely extends beyond patients with familial
BRCA syndromes. Some sporadic (nonfamilial) breast and
ovarian cancers are now recognized to harbor de novo
mutations or promoter hypermethylation in BRCA1/2.
Some types of cancers harbor alterations in other HRassociated genes such as RAD50, RAD51, ATR, ATM, or
FANC family genes, conferring sensitivity to PARP1 inhibition. It is interesting to note that mutations in PTEN have
also been found to sensitize cells to PARP1 inhibition, most
likely due to downregulation of RAD51, a critical HR gene,
although the precise mechanism remains unclear.67
Synthetic Lethality: “BRCAness”

This constellation of findings in BRCA-related pathways
has led to the recognition of a broader concept of
“BRCAness” in cancer. This term refers to the evidence
that other genetic lesions in sporadically occurring cancers
can phenocopy familial BRCA1/2 mutation-driven cancers. These cancers harbor impaired DNA repair mechanisms, potentially rendering them more sensitive to
therapies with DNA-damaging agents such as crosslinking
drugs such as cisplatin or mitomycin, and potentially
establishing vulnerability to synthetic lethal therapies.
There are great similarities in gene expression profiles
among BRCA1/2-mutated, basal-like, and triple-negative
breast cancers, as well as serous ovarian cancers.68 For
example, there are molecular fingerprints such as expression signatures that identify BRCA1-like breast cancers.69,70 There are implications of BRCAness outside of
breast cancer as well; for example, there are lung cancers
with mutations in BRCA1, XRCC5, XRCC3, ERCC1, or
RRM1, in which PARP inhibitors appear to have activity
in combination with radiotherapy,71 and also chronic
lymphocytic leukemias with ATM mutations that are sensitive to cytotoxic agents.72

Synthetic Lethality: Beyond PARP

Although PARP inhibition has received the most attention, several other synthetic lethal strategies targeting
DNA repair proteins also have demonstrated significant
promise. For example, the TSGs MLH1 or MSH2, implicated in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, mediate
the mismatch repair pathway. These alterations are synthetically lethal with inhibition of DNA polymerases, specifically, MLH1 with POLG and MSH2 with POLB.73,74
Therefore, inhibitors of these DNA polymerases may
have activity in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer.
Another example is inhibition of the enzyme DNAdependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs),
which cooperates with ATM and ATR to phosphorylate
proteins involved in NHEJ. ATM-deficient cancer cells
are addicted to DNA-PKcs activity to survive DNA damage, and DNA-PKcs agents may therefore have activity in
ATM-deficient or ATR-deficient cancers.75,76 WEE1
inhibitors capitalize on the finding that cancer cells with
dysfunctional p53 rely on the G2 checkpoint to repair
DNA damage. WEE1 is a nuclear serine/threonine kinase
that drives G2/M-phase checkpoint progression. After
DNA damage, WEE1 is phosphorylated and stabilized,
leading to cell cycle arrest. In combination with DNA
damaging agents, WEE1 kinase inhibition selectively
induce death of p53-mutant cancer cells.77 This results in
mitotic catastrophe.78 A WEE1 inhibitor is currently in
early-phase clinical trials for the treatment of patients with
p53-deficient ovarian cancer.
More recently, the field has moved toward using
high-throughput unbiased screening methodologies to
identify novel synthetic lethal interactions. These techniques are generally based on modeling in yeast79 or human
cancer cell lines,80 and use RNA interference or chemical
compounds, or both.81 Bioinformatic approaches can also
predict synthetic lethal interactions. For example, the
DAISY pipeline leverages pan-cancer sequencing data to
identify coinactivated genes that occur less frequently
than expected, suggesting that they have been eliminated
from surviving cancer cell populations. As a proof of principle, this approach was able to identify numerous genes
that were then experimentally validated as synthetically lethal partners of VHL in renal cancer cells.82
“Collateral Lethality”

An intriguing concept related to synthetic lethality was
recently proposed and named “collateral lethality.” When
tumor suppressor genes undergo homozygous deletion,
the region of deletion can be quite broad, and usually
encompasses several (or many) neighboring genes.
1363

Review Article

Because these broad genetic alterations are not selected
against during the development of cancer, the collateral
effect on other genes must not be ultimately harmful to
the cell. However, these passenger deletions of nearby
genes may generate vulnerabilities if the nearby deleted
gene is one of several redundant genes that perform a
housekeeping function critical to cell survival. As a proof
of principle, Muller et al examined genes in the 1p36
locus, which is deleted in a small percent (1%-5%) of glioblastomas.83 The ENO1 gene is located in this region and
is one of 3 mammalian genes encoding enolase, an enzyme
that mediates glycolysis. In glioma cells with a passenger
deletion affecting ENO1, knockdown of ENO2 abrogated
tumorigenic potential. Similarly, an enolase inhibitor was
selectively toxic for ENO1-deleted cells. There are numerous other candidates for such a collateral lethality
approach. There are several similarly situated housekeeping genes within functionally redundant families that can
be identified within the deletion peaks targeting chromosome 9p21 (deleting CDKN2A) and 10q23 (deleting
PTEN).83 It has been estimated that 11% of proteincoding genes undergo homozygous deletion in patients
with cancer,84 making such a personalized therapeutic
approach potentially promising in many malignancies.
Taking Aim at Epigenetic Mechanisms

It is now well understood that many epigenetic processes
are altered during the development of cancer. There are
several complex mechanisms by which TSGs are silenced
in cancer as a result of dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms. The important processes altered in cancer center
around modulation of the chromatin landscape, and
include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and
nucleosome remodeling. During the process of tumor initiation and progression, the cancer epigenome is remodeled in several complex ways, including global
hypomethylation, increased promoter methylation at
CpG islands, and alterations in nucleosome occupancy.85
Ultimately, it is the balance between transcriptionally permissive and transcriptionally repressive chromatin modifications that affects gene expression, and it is an imbalance
in these modifications that is observed in cancer.86
At its simplest, the role of epigenetic alterations in
cancer is best exemplified by promoter hypermethylation
of TSGs, leading to gene silencing. Many canonical TSGs
are hypermethylated in cancer, including BRCA1/2, RB,
and PTEN.87 In contrast, there are several important
TSGs that are silenced in cancer but rarely undergo mutation or deletion, including the DNA repair gene
MGMT88; the cell cycle regulator CDKN2B; the RAS1364

binding protein RASSF1A; MLH1, which plays an important role in genomic stability; and secreted frizzledrelated proteins, which negatively regulate WNT signaling.89 In certain types of cancer, a genome-wide CpG
island methylator phenotype has been reported, and these
tumors demonstrate unique genetic and epigenetic characteristics.90-92
DNA methylation in mammalian cells is regulated
by DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs). Mutations in
several members of this family have been identified in cancer, including DNMT1 mutations in colorectal cancer93
and DNMT3A mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).94,95 Inhibitors of DNMTs such as 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2deoxycytidine reverse hypermethylation of DNA and
have now been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for use in patients with MDS and selected
patients with AML. Patients with MDS experienced
improved survival with 5-azacytidine in a randomized
controlled trial. Response appears to be modulated, in
part, by the status of the demethylating genes DNMT3A
and TET2.96,97
Mutation of epigenetic regulators can cause profound changes in gene expression and cellular behavior.
For example, mutation of the noncanonical oncogene isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) results in fulminant
DNA hypermethylation, silencing of differentiation
mediators, and a block in differentiation.98,99 Although a
specific inhibitor of mutant IDH is quite effective in
reversing this block in differentiation in AML, it has been
less active in solid tumors with extensive mutant IDHinduced hypermethylation.100 In IDH-mutant glioma
cells and mutant IDH-transformed mesenchymal cells,
DNMT inhibitors have been quite effective, acting by
demethylating and reactivating the tumor suppressors
silenced by mutant IDH.101-103
Histones are critical regulators of the chromatin
landscape, and modification of histones is able to alter
chromatin dynamics and gene expression. Histone methylation can be described as either activating (eg, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, H3K4me3) or repressing
(eg, H3K27me3, H3K9me3) transcription. Histones can
also undergo modification via acetylation, which is associated with active transcription. Histone deacetylases
(HDACs) are “eraser” genes that remove acetyl groups
from histone tails and thereby repress transcription. Aberrant activity of HDACs has been implicated in cancer and
plays a role in silencing TSGs. For example, the promoter
of CDKN1A is hypoacetylated in cancer; this can be
reversed by inhibiting HDAC activity.104 Overexpression

of HDACs has also been implicated in the silencing of
BRCA1 and ATR.105 Mutations in HDAC genes have
also been identified in several types of cancer.106 There are
currently 2 HDAC inhibitors (vorinostat and romidepsin) that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with refractory cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma.107,108 These and several other agents currently are in clinical trials for solid and hematologic malignancies. Despite responses in patients with hematologic
malignancies, durable responses in patients with solid
tumors have been uncommon with current agents, and
significant toxicity has been observed in some trials. Additional trials with combination therapies are planned.105
The Polycomb group of repressor proteins are chromatin remodelers that control transcription by regulating
the accessibility of gene regulatory elements to transcriptional machinery (eg, by occupying the transcription start
site and compacting chromatin).109 These proteins have
been observed to undergo alteration in cancer. For example, the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 is formed by
enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), SUZ12, and embryonic ectoderm development (EED), which together
can silence gene expression by trimethylating H3K27.
EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of this complex and is overexpressed or mutated, and associated with H3K27me3, in
several cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung
cancer.110 Among other TSGs, EZH2 has been shown to
repress the expression of the CDKN2A (p14/p16)
locus.111 This has led to great interest in targeting EZH2
in cancer as a means of disabling the Polycomb Repressive
Complex 2, with several emerging agents including 3deazaneplanocin A and novel agents that disrupt the interaction between EZH2 and EED.112,113
Immunotherapy

The field of cancer immunotherapy has recently experienced remarkable advances, with immune checkpoint
inhibitors demonstrating strong promise in several tumor types.114,115 Clinical responses can be dramatic and
durable. Although the molecular determinants of
response are ill-defined, these immunotherapy
approaches likely target neoantigens formed by somatic
mutations that can cause tumors to present “non-self”
peptides on major histocompatibility complex molecules. This is in contrast to the more focused tactic of
vaccines targeting specific, nonforeign proteins such as
mutant p53, as discussed earlier. Bioinformatic
approaches are now able to examine exome sequencing
data across multiple types of cancer, to identify tumorspecific mutated peptides, combined with predicted

binding to major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, inferring neoantigens that would be expected to be
presented to CD8-positive T cells. Many of these mutations represent TSGs. In fact, the number of neoantigens
generated from missense and frameshift mutations was
proportional to the mutational rate in the tumor.116
Conclusions

Progress in recent years has fortunately belied the concerns
of some researchers that TSGs were going to be a
“neglected” area of therapeutics.117 Nevertheless, the
translation of basic cancer research findings into therapy is
a long journey. The steady progress being made in targeting p53 and other TSGs is a decades-long effort, not dissimilar to the history of the development of molecular
targeted therapies directed at oncogenes such as BRAF and
PIK3CA. Continued progress in basic research into TSG
biology, and the allied fields of DNA damage repair, p53
biology, oncolytic viruses, signaling pathways, the cancer
epigenome, and the immune system, will be essential to
informing translational laboratory work in functional
genomics and pharmacology, and ultimately bringing
novel compounds to the clinic.
