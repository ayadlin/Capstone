mechanism for endoglin shedding and deregulation of TGF-b
signaling

Endoglin is a transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) coreceptor that serves as a prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic vascular
target in human cancer. A number of endoglin ectodomain-targeting antibodies (Abs) can effectively suppress both normal and
tumor-associated angiogenesis, but their molecular actions remain poorly characterized. Here we deﬁne a key mechanism for
TRACON105 (TRC105), a humanized monoclonal Ab in clinical trials for treatment of advanced or metastatic tumors. TRC105, along
with several other endoglin Abs tested, enhance endoglin shedding through direct coupling of endoglin and the membrane-type 1
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-14 at the cell surface to release the antiangiogenic factor, soluble endoglin (sEng). In addition to
this coupling process, endoglin shedding is further ampliﬁed by increased MMP-14 expression that requires TRC105 concentrationdependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. There were also notable counterbalancing effects on canonical Smad signaling
in which TRC105 abrogated both the steady-state and TGF-b-induced Smad1/5/8 activation while augmenting Smad2/3 activation.
Interestingly, TRC105-induced sEng and aberrant Smad signaling resulted in an excessive migratory response through enhanced
stress ﬁber formation and disruption of endothelial cell–cell junctions. Collectively, our study deﬁnes endoglin shedding and
deregulated TGF-b signaling during migration as major mechanisms by which TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis is a process in which new blood vessels are formed
from pre-existing vasculature. As tumors require angiogenesis
to grow and metastasize to distant organs, reducing tumor
vascularization is a promising strategy in limiting cancer progression.1 Endoglin is a transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) coreceptor that is emerging as a unique vascular target in anticancer
therapy.2–5 Numerous studies have shown that endoglin is
required for both normal and tumor-induced angiogenesis,
and is considered as the gold standard biomarker of tumor
vasculatures for tumor progression, survival rate and metastases.6
Despite a growing number of endoglin monoclonal antibodies
(Abs) under evaluation for clinical applications, however, the
underlying molecular mechanisms of antibody (Ab) action remain
poorly deﬁned.
As part of an integral TGF-b signaling complex in endothelial
cells, the essential role of endoglin in angiogenesis during
embryonic development and tumor growth is well established.7
Endoglin knockout in mice is embryonic lethal due to defective
angiogenesis, and multiple studies have shown that either
depletion or targeted inhibition of endoglin expression impairs
tumor vascularization.5,8,9 These effects are mediated in large part
by two canonical TGF-b signaling pathways.
In endothelial cells, TGF-b can either promote or inhibit angiogenesis depending on its association with two types of signaling
receptors. The endothelial-speciﬁc receptor, ALK1, enhances a
proangiogenic transcriptional response by phosphorylating and

activating Smad1/5/8 transcriptional factors.10 Alternatively, TGF-b
can signal through ALK5, a ubiquitously expressed signaling
receptor that suppresses angiogenesis by activating Smad2/3.10 In
addition, endoglin and ALK1 can each bind a structurally related
TGF-b superfamily ligand, bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP-9),
which signals through the ALK1/Smad1/5/8 pathway.11 Although
the precise mechanisms by which TGF-b and BMP-9 regulate
angiogenesis is still an active area of investigation, endoglin is
considered a critical component in modulating the balance
between ALK1 and ALK5 signaling to exert either pro- or
antiangiogenic signals.
The complex role of endoglin in angiogenesis is also evident at
the level of extracellular domain shedding.12 A recent study has
demonstrated that endoglin is cleaved near the plasma
membrane by membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-14 to release a soluble form of endoglin (sEng) into the
circulation.13 And although membrane-bound endoglin promotes
angiogenesis, sEng antagonizes this process through multiple
mechanisms including cell surface receptor downregulation and
ligand sequestration. More recently, a surface plasmon resonance
study demonstrated direct binding of sEng with BMP-9 but not
TGF-b, suggesting that sEng inhibits angiogenesis in part by
dampening the BMP-9/Smad1/5/8 signaling axis.14 Overall,
endoglin shedding has a critical role in regulating TGF-b signaling
during angiogenesis.
Numerous preclinical studies have so far demonstrated the
efﬁcacy of endoglin-targeted therapies. Of particular interest is

TRACON105 (TRC105), the ﬁrst humanized monoclonal Ab
currently in phase I/II clinical trials for treatment of advanced or
metastatic solid tumors.15 To date, it is unclear whether TRC105
and its variants inhibit angiogenesis by neutralizing endoglin
signaling, by mediating Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
or by inducing endothelial cell dysfunction through a combination
of mechanisms. In the present study, we examined the
mechanistic basis for how TRC105 and other endoglin-targeting
Abs inhibit angiogenesis.
RESULTS
We chose to study the effects of TRC105 on two types of human
endothelial cells, a human microvascular endothelial cell line
(HMEC-1) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC), to deﬁne the mechanisms by which endoglin-targeting
Abs inhibit angiogenesis. We ﬁrst examined the effects of TRC105
on the steady-state TGF-b signaling to the canonical ALK1/Smad1/
5/8 and ALK5/Smad2/3 pathways. A 24 h treatment with TRC105 in
growth media caused a signiﬁcant enhancement in Smad2/3
activation, whereas Smad1/5/8 activation was markedly reduced
in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 1a and b). The
Smads appeared as either single or doublet bands when
immunoblotted with their respective phospho-speciﬁc and total
Smad Abs, depending on the gel electrophoresis conditions as
previously reported.16,17 We next tested for ligand responsiveness
by subjecting the cells to serum deprivation, followed by a brief
pretreatment with TRC105 (10 min) before either TGF-b or BMP-9
stimulation. Interestingly, TRC105 treatment abrogated TGF-binduced Smad1/5/8 activation, whereas its effect on Smad2/3 was
enhanced (Figure 1c). Given that TGF-b-induced Smad1/5/8
activation ﬁrst requires TGF-b binding to the endothelial-speciﬁc
endoglin/ALK1 complex, these results suggest that TRC105
prevents the TGF-b/endoglin interaction, while presumably
providing ALK5 a greater access to the ligand for Smad2/3
activation. In the case of BMP-9, there was a robust Smad1/5/8
activation irrespective of TRC105 treatment (Figure 1d). Together,
these results suggest that by targeting endoglin, TRC105

selectively inhibits the regulation of TGF-b but not BMP-9
signaling, and that overall, TRC105 attenuates the activation of
Smad1/5/8 in favor of Smad2/3.
To determine the cellular effects of TRC105, we ﬁrst tested its
impact on endothelial cell growth using the MTT assay. We and
others18,19 have previously reported that endoglin suppresses cell
growth in part by downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) activation and c-Myc expression. Interestingly,
endoglin targeting by TRC105 had minimal effect on cell growth
relative to the control immunoglobulin G (IgG) over the course of
48 h treatment (Figure 2a, left graph) or by cell doubling time
(data not shown), whereas endoglin depletion predictably yielded
increased cell growth relative to the control (Figure 2a, right
graph). We further compared the mitogenic response between
endoglin targeting by TRC105 and endoglin depletion
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Here, endoglin depletion by short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) stable knockdown caused a notable increase
in ERK activation that activates c-Myc expression compared with
the non-targeting control Ab, whereas endoglin targeting by
TRC105 or control Ab had minimal effects (Supplementary
Figure 1A). In addition to proliferation, cells were assessed for
TRC105 dose-dependent cytochrome c release as an indicator of
mitochondrial dissolution and apoptosis. Consistent with the cell
proliferation data, TRC105 did not induce a signiﬁcant cytosolic
cytochrome c release relative to untreated cells (B3–5%)
(Figure 2b, graph). In comparison, TGF-b, as a known inducer of
apoptosis, yielded 25–30% cytochrome c release (Figure 2b;
graph). Furthermore, there was no detectable difference in
caspase cleavage relative to control IgG (Figure 2c), indicating
that TRC105 does not have a direct role in growth inhibition or
apoptosis.
Although previous studies have established sEng as an
antiangiogenic factor in vitro and in vivo,20–23 whether endoglin
Abs regulate sEng production has not been examined. To test
whether TRC105 has a functional role in regulating sEng
production, we measured for endogenous sEng in the
conditioned media of HUVECs and HMEC-1s upon TRC105
treatment for 24 h. Intriguingly, there was a distinct TRC105

concentration-dependent increase in sEng when released into the
media from both cell types, whereas expression of total
endogenous cellular endoglin remained constant (Figures 3a
and b upper and middle panels). As TRC105 caused endoglin
downregulation by promoting shedding rather than degradation,
we explored the possibility that TRC105 regulates the MMP-14
activity. Notably, MMP-14 expression was moderately increased as
a result of TRC105 treatment (Figures 3a and b third panels). To
test whether this was an epitope-related effect, three additional
Abs targeting different epitopes were measured for their
endoglin-shedding effects. Similar to TRC105, all three Abs tested
signiﬁcantly enhanced the level of sEng compared with no
treatment (Figure 3c), indicating a general role for endoglintargeting Abs in sEng production. Moreover, three of the four Abs
tested, including TRC105, also promoted MMP-14 expression
relative to the control (Figure 3c, third panel).
To deﬁne the mechanism of Ab-induced endoglin shedding, we
ﬁrst examined their direct effects on MMP-14 proteolytic activity.
We hypothesized that endoglin-targeting Abs promote the
Oncogene (2014) 3970 – 3979

coupling of endoglin and MMP-14 into a complex at the cell
surface. To test this, cells expressing myc-tagged endoglin and
human inﬂuenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MMP-14 were
subjected to a brief pretreatment with TRC105 at 4 1C to allow
TRC105 to react with membrane-localized endoglin while
preventing their endocytosis. Although the immunoprecipitation
with either anti-HA or MMP-14-speciﬁc Ab yielded a barely
detectable transient interaction with full-length endoglin in the
absence of pretreatment, TRC105 pretreatment dramatically
enhanced their interaction, suggesting an Ab-induced coupling
of endoglin/MMP-14 at the cell surface (Figures 4a and b). To
exclude the possibility of TRC105 non-speciﬁcally targeting MMP14, a parallel experiment was performed in which cells expressing
MMP-14 alone, or MMP-14 and endoglin, were treated with TRC105
and then immunoprecipitated with TRC105 (Supplementary
Figure 1B). As predicted, TRC105 failed to react with MMP-14
irrespective of pretreatment (lanes 1 and 2), and only coimmunoprecipitated MMP-14 when endoglin was co-expressed
(lane 3, Supplementary Figure 1B). To speciﬁcally examine whether

the Ab-induced coupling of the endoglin/MMP-14 complex
occurred at the cell surface, cells expressing MMP-14 and endoglin
were pretreated with or without TRC105 at 4 1C before cell surface
biotinylation, followed by immunoprecipitation of MMP-14. Consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation results, TRC105 pretreatment enabled the detection of biotinylated endoglin/MMP-14
complex, conﬁrming TRC105 action at the cell surface (Figure 4c).
Finally, to demonstrate that endoglin shedding speciﬁcally requires
MMP-14 proteolytic activity, we used an MMP-14 blocking Ab (aMMP-14) that neutralizes its catalytic function.24–26 Although
TRC105 markedly enhanced endoglin shedding relative to the
basal state, we repeatedly observed only slight increases in sEng
upon MMP-14 inhibition (Figure 4d), presumably through indirect
proteolytic actions of other MMPs. However, the level of sEng upon
co-treatment of TRC105 and a-MMP-14 was lower than TRC105
alone, indicating that the TRC105-induced shedding requires MMP14 activity (Figure 4d). Taken together, these biochemical studies
indicate that TRC105 induces endoglin shedding by promoting its
interaction with MMP-14 for proteolytic cleavage.
In addition to the biochemical approaches, we employed an
immunoﬂuorescence co-patching method to visualize TRC105induced cell surface clustering of the endoglin/MMP-14 complex.
Originally developed by Henis and co-workers27–29, this method
provides a semi-quantitative analysis of two known interacting
proteins to form heteromeric co-patched clusters at the cell

surface. In control experiments, we measured the degree of
random co-patching between MMP-14 with ALK3, another TGF-b
superfamily membrane receptor. Upon expressing Myc-tagged
ALK3 with HA-tagged MMP-14, each protein was allowed to
aggregate into patched clusters by probing with its respective
primary and then ﬂuorophore-conjugated secondary Abs at 4 1C
before ﬁxation. This Ab-induced aggregation yielded mostly
distinct green and red patches, indicating that TRC105 did not
promote the dimerization of ALK3 and MMP-14 (Figures 5d and e;
random overlay image and graph). In contrast, endoglin and MMP14 co-expression followed by immunoprobing with TRC105 and
either anti-HA or MMP-14-speciﬁc Ab resulted in signiﬁcant copatching and co-localization (Figures 5a–c, inset in image c and
overlay in d). The level of TRC105-induced endoglin/MMP-14 copatching was signiﬁcantly greater than the random control (60
versus 10%) regardless of whether HA or MMP-14-speciﬁc Ab was
used (Figure 5e graph). To further test whether this coupling is
TRC105-speciﬁc or a general endoglin-Ab-directed effect, we used
P3D1 Ab that also promoted sEng production (Figure 3c). P3D1 and
MMP-14-speciﬁc Abs yielded B40% co-patching (Figure 5e graph),
strongly supporting a general role for endoglin-targeting Abs in
endoglin/MMP-14 coupling at the cell surface. Taken together,
these biochemical and immunoﬂuorescence data demonstrate that
endoglin-targeting Abs mediate endoglin/MMP-14 coupling at the
cell surface to promote endoglin shedding.

Given the observation that TRC105 also promotes MMP-14
expression (Figure 3) that likely further potentiates endoglin
shedding, we measured the effect of TRC105 on gene expression
and found that TRC105 typically ampliﬁed MMP-14 gene expression 1.5–2-fold relative to the control (Figure 6a). As TGF-b has
been shown to transcriptionally regulate several members of the
MMP family in other cell types by Smad2/3 induction of Snail
transcription factor,30,31 we tested this pathway as a possible
mechanism for TRC105-induced MMP-14 gene expression.
Contrary to expectations, blocking Smad2/3 activation with
the ALK5 inhibitor (SB431542) markedly enhanced MMP-14
transcription relative to the control or TRC105 treatment
(Figure 6b graph). Co-treatment with the ALK5 inhibitor and
TRC105 failed to suppress MMP-14 transcription, suggesting that
the TRC105-induced MMP-14 expression is Smad2/3-independent.
We next screened several small-molecule inhibitors to identify
other potential signaling effectors mediating this process. Induction of MMP-14 mRNA by TRC105 was most sensitive to JNK
inhibition (Figure 6c). Consistent with this ﬁnding, there was a
distinct concentration-dependent increase in JNK activation by
TRC105 (Figure 6d), supporting the novel role of TRC105 in JNKmediated MMP-14 transcriptional regulation.
Although sEng is a well-established antiangiogenic factor
in vivo, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms have
not been fully elucidated. Having ruled out growth inhibition and
apoptosis as major cellular mechanisms, we tested whether
TRC105 and sEng production disrupt cell motility. HUVEC and
HMEC-1 were treated with either low or high concentrations of
TRC105 and allowed to migrate in a transwell system.
Oncogene (2014) 3970 – 3979

Interestingly, TRC105 increased the migratory response in both
the HMEC-1 and HUVEC (Figures 7a and b), a result consistent with
the anti-migratory role for endoglin in previous studies using the
endoglin knockout and knockdown systems.32–34 Next, given that
MMP-14 activity is required for efﬁcient motility in many cell types,
we examined whether the TRC105 enhances migration by
upregulating MMP-14 activity. To do so, we co-treated cells with
TRC105 in the presence or absence of the MMP-14 blocking Ab.
Consistent with previous reports of MMP-14-neutralizing function,
a-MMP-14 treatment alone effectively suppressed cell migration
relative to the control (Figure 7c). Furthermore, TRC105 treatment
failed to override the inhibitory effects of a-MMP-14 in cells
treated with both Abs (Figure 7c), suggesting that MMP-14 activity
mediates TRC105-induced migration. Finally, to speciﬁcally test
the role of sEng in cell motility, we compared the migratory
response of TRC105-treated cells with those expressing a secreted
form of endoglin into the conditioned medium (Eng-E: extracellular domain). As predicted, the expression of Eng-ECD resulted
in a signiﬁcant enhancement of migration similar to that of
TRC105 treatment, the effects of which were not signiﬁcantly
reduced even when incubated with a-MMP-14 Ab (Figure 7d).
To determine the mechanisms by which increased endothelial
migration might contribute to reduced angiogenesis, we examined several cellular properties including the actin cytoskeleton
organization, and more the recently described phenomenon of
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.35,36 Given that a-smooth
muscle actin (a-SMA) is a marker of endothelial-to-mesenchymal
transition, we tested for a-SMA expression in HUVEC and
HMEC-1. Although a-SMA expression could not be detected by

immunoﬂuorescence staining or immunoblotting (data not
shown), we observed a striking increase in actin stress ﬁbers in
HMEC-1 and HUVEC when treated with TRC105 (Figure 8A).
Moreover, while the additional contractile forces generated by the
stress ﬁbers likely contribute to enhanced cell motility, we also
measured how TRC105 inﬂuences endothelial cell–cell contacts
during the maturation phase of angiogenesis. Near conﬂuent
monolayers of HUVEC were treated with or without TRC105 for
12–24 h, then stained with endothelial-speciﬁc adherens junctions
markers (Figure 8B). Whereas untreated cells formed a complete
monolayer accompanied by prominent vascular endothelial (VE)cadherin and platelet endothelial cell adhesion (PECAM) staining
along cell–cell junctions. TRC105 treatment prevented the
formation of efﬁcient cell–cell contacts as indicated by the
reduced VE-cadherin and PECAM localization along cell membranes (Figure 8B, I–III versus IV–VI). Taken together, our data here
strongly support the role of TRC105 in perturbring normal
endoglin regulation of endothelial migration and the formation
of endothelial cell junctions.
DISCUSSION
Endoglin shedding is an important process in the regulation of
angiogenesis and endothelial homeostasis. Not only does shedding reduce the overall cell surface level of endoglin, the resulting
product acts as an antiangiogenic factor by sequestering
circulating BMP-9.14 The recent discovery of MMP-14 as the
major protease responsible for endoglin shedding has raised an
important question as to whether this proteolytic processing is
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

actively regulated or whether it involves a general housekeeping
mechanism. Our present study provides novel evidence that
endoglin Abs have an important role in endoglin shedding—a key
ﬁnding that is now supported by clinical evidence. Indeed, results
from the ﬁrst-in-human, phase I trial now reveal that, among the
37 plasma-based protein biomarkers tested, there is a dramatic
dose-dependent increase in sEng levels in patients treated with
TRC105 (personal communication with Drs Y Liu and A Nixon,
Duke University, manuscript submitted).
Notably, our data indicate that TRC105 induces endoglin
shedding through two overlapping mechanisms. First, we used
multiple biochemical and immunoﬂuorescence approaches to
demonstrate that endoglin Abs enhance shedding by directly
coupling endoglin and MMP-14 into complex at the cell surface
(Figure 8). This process likely involves the stabilization of a
preformed endoglin/MMP-14 complex, as our control experiments
demonstrate that TRC105 speciﬁcally targets endoglin and does
not directly react with MMP-14. Second, our small-molecule kinase
inhibitor screening identiﬁed JNK signaling as the key mediator of
TRC105-induced MMP-14 gene expression instead of Smad2/3,
which has been previously shown to induce MMP-14 gene
expression through Snail transcription factor. This ﬁnding was
rather unexpected, as TRC105 promoted Smad2/3 activation at
steady state and in rapid response to TGF-b (Figure 1). Instead, the
Smad2/3 upregulation may contribute toward pro-migratory
phenotype through transcriptional regulation of known mediators
of cell motility, including PAI-1 (schematic, Supplementary

data is also consistent with the role of TRC105 in stimulating cell
motility through ALK5/JNK-induced stress ﬁber formation. Our
data here also reveal important clues as to how endoglin Abs may
alter receptor oligomerization at the cell surface, not only with
ALK1 and ALK5, but also another subset of TGF-b superfamily
receptors such as ALK3 and ALK6, which are known to interact
with endoglin in various contexts.22,23,37,38 How TRC105 and

related Abs alter these heteromeric receptor complexes need to
be studied to more fully understand the molecular basis for their
antiangiogenic effects.
Although it is clear that endoglin Abs cause endoglin shedding,
the fate of the remaining membrane-anchored intracellular
domain is unclear. Although this relatively short cytoplasmic
domain lacks a catalytic function, it contains important structural

elements that serve as docking sites for multiple adaptor proteins.
To date, at least ﬁve binding partners have been identiﬁed: zyxin,
zyxin-related protein 1, b-arrestin2, Tctex2b and GIPC.32–34,39,40
Given that these proteins differentially regulate endoglin
signaling, trafﬁcking or exert distinct cellular effects during
angiogenesis, it will be critical to deﬁne precisely how endoglin
Abs affect these important interactions.
Apart from the mechanism of endoglin shedding, understanding the overall effects of TRC105 on endoglin signaling
and biology appears to be much more complex than anticipated.
For instance, endoglin depletion in HMEC-1 increased the
mitogenic response (that is, ERK activation, c-Myc expression
and cell proliferation), whereas TRC105 yielded no changes,
suggesting that, overall, TRC105 alters rather than neutralizes
endoglin function. This notion is consistent with our data showing
that endoglin expression is not signiﬁcantly altered by TRC105
even though a subpopulation of endoglin undergoes shedding.
Another related but surprising ﬁnding in our studies was that
TRC105 and its sEng byproduct minimally induced growth arrest
or apoptosis, two widely recognized cellular outcomes of TGF-b
signaling to the ALK5/Smad2/3 pathway (Figure 2). These results
are in contrast with previous preclinical studies in which TRC105induced apoptosis in HUVEC.4 Although our results showed no
such TRC105-related effects, a notable difference between the two
studies is the markedly higher concentration of TRC105 used to
induce apoptosis (50–100 mg/ml) compared with our experimental
conditions (0.02–2 mg/ml). Preclinical pharmacokinetic studies
suggest that TRC105 binds to human endoglin with a Kd of
4.6 ng/ml (31 pM), and achieves saturation at 200 ng/ml in
proliferating HUVEC. Although we also did observe growth
inhibition and apoptosis at signiﬁcantly higher doses (500–
1000 mg/ml), these effects were relatively small (B10%) and
statistically similar to that of IgG control (data not shown). Still,
there are other discrepancies that cannot be accounted for, such
as the recent study demonstrating that a relatively high dose of
TRC105 (6 mg/ml or higher) effectively blocks BMP-9-induced
Smad1/5/8 activation in HUVEC.41 In direct contrast, our data
indicate little or no effects on BMP-9/Smad1/5/8 activation either
at low (0.2 mg/ml; Figure 1d) or high concentrations (10 mg/ml;
data not shown).
In our present work, a much more deﬁned endothelial
dysfunction was evidenced in uncontrolled migration of two
different endothelial cell types. To date, the role of endoglin in
endothelial migration remains controversial, with earlier studies
demonstrating that endoglin and ALK1 together promote migration, whereas others10,23,33,42 have reported the opposite ﬁnding.
Although certainly the varying experimental conditions may help
explain these disparate ﬁndings, it is noteworthy that the role of
sEng in these studies had not been examined as a critical variable.
Our data suggest that the degree of sEng production may have a
key role in ﬁne-tuning cell motility, and is consistent with previous
endoglin knockout and knockdown studies, demonstrating that
endoglin inhibits migration and proliferation in certain contexts in
order to facilitate neovessel maturation.18,19,32,33,43
In summary, we have examined the multifunctional role of
TRC105 to provide immediate and clinically relevant mechanistic
insights for rapid improvement of existing antiangiogenic
therapies. Importantly, our results demonstrate a previously
unanticipated role of TRC105 in upregulating sEng production
that contributes to deregulated endothelial migration and
signiﬁcantly alters TGF-b signaling to impair angiogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, transfection and Abs
HUVEC were purchased from Lonza and maintained in endothelial growth
medium (EGM)-2 growth medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). HUVEC
from passages 2 to 9 were used for experiments. HMEC-1 were maintained
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

in MCDB-131 medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml
epidermal growth factor (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine.
COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transfect COS-7 cells as described
according to manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). HMEC-1 were either
transfected with Lipofectamine or Amaxa 4D nucleofection system
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Primary Abs used in this study
were: TRC105 (TRACON Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, USA), endoglin
(H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), endoglin P4A4, P3D1,
and PECAM (University of Iowa Hybridoma, Iowa city, IA, USA), HA-Ab
(Roche, Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA), MMP-14 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The
following Abs were all purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA):
total Smad2/3 (no. 8685), total Smad 1 (no. 6944) and phospho-Smad2/3
(no. 9510), phospho-Smad 1/5/8 (no. 9511), VE-Cadherin (no. 2500), total
SAPK/JNK (no. 9258), phospho-SAPK/JNK (no. 9665), caspase-3 (no. 9665)
and caspase-9 (no. 9508).

Immunoprecipitation
Cells were washed with PBS, then lysed on ice with lysis buffer (20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1%
Nonidet NP-40) and supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma
protease inhibitor cocktail) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma phosphatase inhibitor cocktail). The lysates were precleared by centrifugation and
incubated with appropriate Abs and protein agarose G for 4–6 h at 4 1C.
The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation; pellets were
washed with lysis buffer, and stored in 2  sample buffer before western
blot analyses. For immunoprecipitation of sEng from the conditioned
media, typically media from 10-cm plates of HUVEC and HMEC-1 were
collected and concentrated by Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) before immunoprecipitation with appropriate Abs.

Reverse transcriptase, real-time PCR and shRNAs
Total RNA was extracted from the cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and
2 mg RNA was then converted to cDNA by using the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA).
Gene expression of MMP-14 was quantiﬁed by real-time reverse
transcriptase PCR (Applied Biosystems, Step One) using the SYBR green
assay reagent and gene-speciﬁc primer (Forward 50 -CCTGCCTGCGTCCAT
CA-30 ; and Reverse 50 -TCCAGGGACGCCTCATCA-30 ). Relative ampliﬁcation
was quantiﬁed by normalizing the gene-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation to that of
18s rRNA Forward (50 -GCTCTAGAATTACCACAGTTATC-30 ) and Reverse (50 AAATCAGTTATGGTTCCTTTGGT-30 ) in each sample. The speciﬁc products
were conﬁrmed by SYBR green single-melting curve and a single correctsize product when running in 2% agarose gel. Changes in mRNA
abundance were calculated using 2(T DDC) method.44,45 Quantitative PCR
were run in triplicate. Statistical signiﬁcance is presented as mean±s.d.
The knockdown of human endoglin in HMEC-1 was achieved by
transfecting cells with a shRNA vector purchased from Sigma (Mission
shRNA) (50 -CCGGCCACTTCTACACAGTACCCATCTCGAGATGGGTACTGTGTAG
AAGTGGTTTTTG-30 ) and stably selected using puromycin.

Immunoﬂuorescence
HMEC-1s and HUVECs grown on coverslips were serum starved for 3–4 h,
washed with PBS and then ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were
permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min, then blocked with 5%
bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 20 min. All
primary Abs were incubated at room temperature for 1 h unless noted
otherwise. Cytochrome c was detected using cytochrome c Ab (Invitrogen).
VE-cadherin (Cell Signaling) and PECAM Abs (University of Iowa
Hybridoma) were used to detect endothelial cell–cell junctions. Actin
was detected using Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin for 30 min.
Wherever appropriate, cells were co-stained with DAPI (Sigma) immediately before immunoﬂuorescence microscopy analyses. For immunoﬂuorescence co-patching, cells expressing endoglin and MMP-14 were washed
with cold PBS, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS before 1 h
incubation with appropriate Abs (TRC105 and Myc or HA) at 4 1C to allow
cell surface labeling while preventing internalization. Cells were then
washed three times with cold PBS, then incubated with secondary
ﬂuorophore-conjugated Abs (for example, anti-human for TRC105 and
anti-mouse for HA or Myc-Ab) for 30 min at 4 1C. To analyze the copatching, Pearson correlation coefﬁcient software (http://www.wessa.net/

index.html) to calculate the degree of co-localization of two ﬂuorophores.

Transwell migration assays
Cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a transwell ﬁlter in growth
media, coated both at the top and bottom with gelatin to assess cell
migration. Cells were allowed to migrate for 16 h at 3 1C through the
gelatin-coated toward the lower chamber containing growth media with
TRC105 (0.02–2 mg/ml). Migrated cells on the bottom surface of the ﬁlter
were ﬁxed, stained and then digitally imaged before counting.

Cell surface biotinylation assay
Cells were washed brieﬂy with cold PBS before biotinylation with
membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent (Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin,
Thermo Scientiﬁc, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to manufacturer
protocol. The biotinylation reaction was neutralized and cells were washed
three times with cold PBS, then lysed and prepared for immunoprecipitation with MMP-14 (HA-Ab). The immunoprecipitated MMP-14 along with
interacting proteins were resolved on SDS–PAGE and immunoblotted with
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase.
