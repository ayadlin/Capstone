ABSTRACT
Therapeutic intervention in neddylation pathway is an emerging area for
cancer treatment. Herein, we evaluated the clinical relevance and therapeutic
potential of targeting this pathway in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
Immunohistochemistry of neddylation pathway components in a cohort of 322 cases
showed that E1 (NAE1 and UBA3) and E2 (UBC12) enzymes, as well as global NEDD8
conjugation, were upregulated in over 2/3 of human ICC. Notably, NAE1 was identified
as an independent prognosticator for postoperative recurrence (P=0.009) and a
combination of NEDD8 and NAE1 provided a better power for predicting patient clinical
outcomes. In vitro treatment with MLN4924, a small-molecule NEDD8-activating
enzyme inhibitor, led to a dose-dependent decrease of viability in both established
and primary cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Additionally, MLN4924 exhibited at
least additive effect when combined with cisplatin. By blocking cullins neddylation,
MLN4924 inactivated Cullin-Ring ligase (CRL) and caused the accumulation of CRL
substrates that triggered cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis. Meanwhile,
MLN4924 was well-tolerated and significantly inhibited tumor growth in xenograft
model of cholangiocarcinoma. Taken together, our findings indicated that upregulated
neddylation pathway was involved in ICC progression and interference in this pathway
could be a promising target for ICC therapy.

INTRODUCTION

incidence of ICC have been well-recognized worldwide
[1]. Although effective new treatments have increased
survival for many other cancers during the past 30
years, treatment strategies and survival for patients with
ICC have improved little. For the few patients suitable
for curative resection, a dismal 5-year survival of 30%

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the
second most common primary hepatic malignancy after
hepatocellular carcinoma, accounting for approximately
10-15% of primary liver cancer [1]. Rising trends in the

was documented [2]. Still worse, ICC patients respond
poorly to aggressive chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Thus,
identifying effective treatment strategies to improve
outcome is one of the major challenges and future needs
for ICC [3].
Cancer cells depend on oncogenic signals that
promote cell cycle progression and prevent cell death/
senescence that would otherwise result from aberrant
stress. This requires the dysregulation of ubiquitinproteasome pathway that results in permanent activation
of pro-tumor signal cascade [4]. Therefore, modulating
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway represents an attractive
anticancer strategy. Indeed, a proteasome inhibitor
Bortezomib approved for the treatment of multiple
myeloma and relapsed mantle cell lymphoma has gained
good clinical response [4]. Targeting protein homeostasis
has thus become an attractive therapeutic strategy in
human cancers. Due to normal cell toxicity resulted
from global inhibition of proteasome-mediated protein
degradation by Bortezomib, tremendous efforts have been
focused on better specificity by targeting the enzymes
upstream of the proteasome [5].
The main control points in ubiquitin–proteasome
process include families of E3 ubiquitin ligases [6]. Of
note, cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) represent the largest
multiunit E3 ubiquitin ligase family, which show high
selectivity in degradating proteins and are considered
as new targets of interest for cancer therapy [5, 7].
Importantly, NEDD8 modification of cullins, the CRLs
essential components, is required for the activation of
CRLs [8]. The NEDD8-conjugation cascade, called
neddylation, is mediated by E1 NEDD8-activating
enzyme (NAE1/UBA3), E2 NEDD8-conjugating enzyme
(UBC12), and E3 NEDD8 ligases, which activate and
transfer NEDD8 to a target protein successively [9].
Recently, MLN4924, an investigational small-molecule
inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), has
shown antitumor activity in various cancer xenograft
models [10-16]. Mechanistically, MLN4924 abrogates
cullin neddylation, inactivates CRL, and thus causes
accumulation of CRL substrates, which eventually
triggers DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and/or
senescence in a broad panel of tumor cells [12-19]. Due to
its potent anticancer efficacy and well-tolerated toxicity in
preclinical studies, MLN4924 is currently tested in several
Phase I clinical trials for cancer therapy [20, 21].
In the present study, we investigated the expression
of neddylation pathway in human ICC, and tested the
preclinical activity of the NEDD8-activating enzyme
inhibitor MLN4924 against ICC cells. Using a large
consecutive cohort of ICC patients, we found that
neddylation pathway was highly active in ICC and
possessed independent prognostic value. In established
and primary cell lines and xenograft model of ICC,
we demonstrated that inhibition of neddylation was a
promising strategy for treatment of this malignancy.

Neddylation pathway was upregulated in ICC and
correlated with clinical outcome
To address the activation status of neddylation
pathway in ICC, the expression of E1 (NAE1 and
UBA3 subunits) and E2 (UBC12) enzymes as well
as global NEDD8 conjugation were determined by
immunohistochemical staining in tumor samples from
a consecutive cohort of 322 ICC patients. The results
showed that, as compared with intrahepatic bile duct
cells which showed weak or negative expression of these
molecules, high expression of NEDD8 (that represents
the global conjugation of NEDD8 to substrates) was
observed in 68.9% (222/322; moderate, n=92; strong,
n=130) of ICC cases (Fig. 1A-B). Likewise, NAE1,
UBA3 and UBC12 were scored as high intensities in
70.5% (227/322; moderate, n=134; strong, n=93), 67.1%
(216/322; moderate, n=159; strong, n=57), and 72.0%
(232/322; moderate, n=133; strong, n=99) of ICC cases,
respectively (Fig. 1A-B). These data indicated that
neddylation pathway was upregulated in over two third
of human ICC.
To illustrate the clinical relevance of NEDD8,
NAE1, UBA3 and UBC12 expression in ICC, patients
were dichotomized according to high (strong or moderate
intensities) or low (weak or negative intensities)
expression of these markers. Univariate analyses revealed
that high expression of NEDD8, NAE1, and UBC12 were
significantly associated with high risks of postoperative
recurrence in ICC patients (Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Table S2). The median Time to Recurrence (TTR) for
patients with low expression of NEDD8 (44.0 months),
NAE1 (45.5 months), and UBC12 (36.7 months) were
obviously longer than those with high expression
(NEDD8, 14.0 months; NAE1, 13.5 months; UBC12, 15.5
months), respectively (Fig. 1C). Although NEDD8, NAE1,
and UBC12 expression significantly correlated with
tumor recurrence, their expression intensities were largely
independent of conventional clinicopathologic features,
like tumor size, vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis,
intrahepatic metastasis and TNM stage (Supplementary
Table S3). Of note, subgroup analysis showed that the
prognostic value of NEDD8, NAE1, and UBC12 also
existed in patients with relatively early stage disease, such
as patients with small tumor, or with no vascular invasion,
or in early TNM stages (I+II) (Fig. 1D).
Furthermore, to further confirm the prognostic
significance of NEDD8, NAE1, and UBC12 expression,
multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis
was performed, adopting all the significant variables in
univariate analysis. Multivariate analyses revealed that,
among the neddylation pathway components, NAE1 was

the only independent factor for postoperative recurrence
(P = 0.009) (Supplementary Table S2). Patients with high
expression of NAE1 were 1.62 times more likely to suffer
from tumor recurrence than those with low expression
(HR, 1.62; 95%CI, 1.13-2.33), similar to the predictive
power of tumor vascular invasion (HR, 1.65; 95%CI,
1.12-2.43; P = 0.011). However, on multivariate analysis,
NEDD8 and UBC12 expression were not associated with
TTR any more (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, the results
indicated that NAE1 may play a central role in regulating
the neddylation pathway and served as an independent
prognostic factor for TTR in ICC.

Given that NEDD8, NAE1, UBA3 and UBC12
constituted a highly regulated enzymatic cascade, we
explored whether their expression correlated with each
other. Notably, using successively-sectioned tumor tissues,
significantly positive correlations were found among these
components of neddylation pathway (r = 0.287-0.445, P
= 0.012 to P < 0.001, Spearman’s correlation) (Fig. 2AB). Immunoblotting showed constitutive expression of
the four molecules in established cholangiocarcinoma
cell lines (RBE and QBC939) and in-house developed
primary ICC cell lines (Fig. 2C). Considering that NAE1
and UBC12 are the NEDD8 -activating and -conjugating
enzymes respectively, the impact of their combination with

NEDD8 on patient prognosis were investigated. Patients
with simultaneously high expression of NEDD8 and
NAE1 had a strikingly shorter TTR (median, 13.5 months)
than patients with NEDD8low/NAE1low (median, 81.0
months) (P = 0.002) (Fig. 2D). Likewise, simultaneously
high expression of NEDD8 and UBC12 also indicated
an obviously reduced TTR (median, 13.5 months), as
compared with those with NEDD8low/UBC12low (median,

81.0 months) (P = 0.012) (Fig. 2D). Multivariate Cox
analysis, adopting conventional clinicopathologic features,
confirmed that the combination of NEDD8 and NAE1 was
an independent prognostic factor for TTR (Supplementary
Table S4). Patients with NEDD8high/NAE1high were 2
times more likely to develop recurrence than those with
NEDD8low/NAE1low (HR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.25-3.05; P =
0.003).

cell lines, MLN4924 effectively suppressed growth of two
cell lines with the IC50 of 0.378 or 0.629 μM, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S1A-B). However, the other two
primary ICC lines showed only moderate sensitivity or
resistance to MLN4924, with the IC50 of 1.09 or >10 μM,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1C-D). Thus, these
data demonstrated that MLN4924 was a potent inhibitor
of cell proliferation and survival in ICC cells. In addition,
potential synergy was observed between MLN4924 and
cisplatin, an agent used for clinical management of ICC
(Fig. 3D), suggesting that MLN4924 favorably impact the
anti-tumor activity of cisplatin.

Considering the clinical significance of
overactivated neddylation pathway in ICC, we further
tested the efficacy of MLN4924, a specific inhibitor of
NAE, on cholangiocarcinoma cells QBC939 and RBE. In
ATPlite (Fig. 3A) and CCK-8 (Fig. 3B) cell proliferation
assays, MLN4924 significantly inhibited the proliferation
of cells in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, MLN4924
caused a dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation
of QBC939 and RBE cells (Fig. 3C). In four primary ICC

cells, MLN4924 induced apoptosis as reflected by a
shrunk morphology in shape (a feature of apoptosis),
cleaved caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 5A-B) and the
appearance of sub-G1 peak (Fig. 4A). In contrast, in RBE
cells, MLN4924 triggered senescence as demonstrated
by an enlarged and flattened cellular shape as well as the
expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (Fig.
5C).
Further analysis of protein alterations of known
CRL substrates was conducted in MLN4924-treated

cholangiocarcinoma cells (Fig. 5D). Accumulation of NFκB inhibitor pIκB-α was observed, which could retain NFκB subunits in the cytoplasm and decrease their nuclear
localization, resulting in reduced cell viability [11, 24].
Meanwhile, accumulation of DNA replication licensing
proteins CDT1 and ORC1 were detected, whose overexpression were known to cause double-strand break
(DSB) and trigger DNA damage response [17-19], as
demonstrated by the appearance of p-H2AX and p-CHK1
(Fig. 5D).

and control groups were collected, imaged (Fig. 6C),
and weighed (Fig. 6D). As shown in Fig. 6C, the size of
MLN4924-treated cholangiocarcinoma was significantly
smaller than that of control tumors. Consistently, the
weight of MLN4924-treated cholangiocarcinoma was
significantly lighter than that of control tumors (Fig. 6D).
The results clearly indicated that MLN4924 had a strong
anti-tumor activity against cholangiocarcinoma in vivo and
was well tolerated in mice.
To explore the in vivo mechanisms of MLN4924,
immunohistochemical analysis of proliferative and
apoptotic index were conducted. The results showed a
marked decrease of PCNA and Ki-67 intensities indicating
the suppression of cell proliferation, and an obvious
increase in TUNEL staining indicating the induction of
apoptosis in MLN4924 treated tumors, as compared with
control tumors (Fig. 6E). Finally, tissue samples from four
tumors each group were randomly selected to determine
the inactivation status of CRL by measuring the expression
of classical tumor-suppressive CRL substrates. Consistent
with in vitro experiments, sharp increases of ORC1, p21,
p27, WEE1 and C-casp3, as well as accumulation of
pIκB-α, were observed in MLN4924-treated tumors (Fig.

of neddylation pathway components, like NEDD8, NAE1,
UBA3 and UBC12, was up-regulated in more than two
third of human ICC and significantly positive correlations
were found among them. More importantly, NAE1 was
identified as an independent factor for postoperative
recurrence and a combination of NAE1 and NEDD8
provided a better prediction for patient prognosis. Similar
results have also been reported in human lung cancer and
colon cancer, where expression of neddylation pathway
correlated with cancer progression and poor prognosis [16,
27].
Then, we demonstrated significant anti-tumor and
chemosensitizing/synergizing effects of MLN4924 both
in established and primary cholangiocarcinoma cell lines,
as well as in mice xenograft model with low toxicity.
Interestingly, MLN4924 induced cell death via either
apoptosis or cellular senescence in a cell line-dependent
manner. Mechanistically, the anticancer efficacy of
MLN4924 is mainly attributed to the inhibition of CRL
activity and the accumulation of CRL substrates. For
examples, MLN4924 treatment led to the accumulation
of (a) G2-M phase transition inhibitor WEE1 that led to
G2 phase cell cycle arrest [10, 14], (b) DNA replication
licensing protein CDT1 and ORC1 that triggered DNA
re-replication stress and DNA damage [10, 14, 17-19],
(c) tumor suppressor p21 and p27 that resulted in cell
senescence [19], and (d) pro-apoptotic proteins such
as NOXA that induced apoptosis [16]. Among these
substrates, NOXA was exclusively induced in some of but
not all treated cells, which led to cell-context induction
of apoptosis [16]. Further studies are required to address
the mechanisms for cell-line dependent induction of proapoptotic proteins (e.g. NOXA) which plays a critical
role in cell fate determination (apoptosis vs senescence)
upon neddylation disruption with MLN4924. In addition,
dramatic accumulation of IκB-α was observed in treated
cells. Considering that induction of NF-κB signaling
was an important mechanism of resistance to many
chemotherapeutic and targeted agents [28, 29], MLN4924
may be helpful to overcome NF-κB-related treatment
resistance.
The anti-tumor potential of MLN4924 in ICC
was largely in line with those findings in hematological
malignancies and other solid tumors, supporting the
rationale to develop phase I trials for evaluating MLN4924
in ICC. However, one of the primary ICC cell line with
the lowest expression of NAE1 were highly resistant to
MLN4924 treatment, indicating the presence of primary
resistance to MLN4924 in ICC, and highlighting the need
for precise patient selection according to the activation
status of neddylation pathway. Similarly, treatmentinduced mutations of NAEβ/UBA3 were reported to lead
to secondary resistance to MLN4924 in leukemia [30,
31], further mandating the development of combinational
regiments including MLN4924 or novel next-generation
NAE inhibitors.

DISCUSSION
Herein, for the first time, we revealed the clinical
significance of neddylation pathway overactivation and
reported preclinical evaluation of inhibiting this pathway
using MLN4924, a potent and selective small-molecule
inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme [10], in ICC. We
found that overactivation or up-regulation of neddylation
pathway occurred in about two third of ICC patients, and
high expression of certain components of neddylation
pathway significantly and independently correlated with
increased tumor recurrence. Moreover, we demonstrated
that MLN4924 had a broad tumoricidal activity both in
vivo and in vitro. Similarly, we and others recently had
reported that neddylation pathway was overactivated
in several types of human cancer and inhibition of this
pathway significantly inhibited tumor growth [12-19].
Thus, these data provided additional information on the
crucial role of neddylation pathway in human cancers
and, in particular, a rationale for targeting this pathway in
patients with ICC.
The therapeutic potential of modulating components
of the UPS and UBL conjugation pathways in cancer has
been demonstrated by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals) [4, 25]. Further
efforts to search other druggable targets in these pathways
had identified NEDD8-activating enzyme as the focus of
particular interest, which could catalyze the first step in the
neddylation pathway [20, 26]. In this study, our interest in
targeting NEDD8-activating enzyme for treatment of ICC
was further stimulated by the observation that expression

In summary, our study demonstrated that
neddylation pathway was upregulated/overactivated
in ICC and served as a promising therapeutic target,
which provided impetus for clinical trials of MLN4924
in the treatment of ICC. Due to the primary resistance to
MLN4924, expression status of neddylation pathway may
provide a base for appropriate patient enrollment, although
further validation was need. Meanwhile, discovery of new
neddylation inhibitors, such as inhibitors of neddylation
E2 or E3 and next-generation E1 inhibitors may provide
additional choice for targeting overactivated neddylation
pathway and overcome the primary/secondary resistance.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines QBC939
(donated by Professor Wang SG at the Third Military
Medical University, China) and RBE (Cell Resource
Center of Tohoku University, Japan) were cultured
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Hyclone),
containing 10% FBS (Biochrom AG) and 1% penicillin–
streptomycin solution, at 37°C with 5% CO2. MLN4924
was synthesized as previously described (34). For in vitro
studies, MLN4924 stock solution (10 mM) was prepared
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -20°C as
small aliquots until needed. For in vivo studies, MLN4924
was dissolved in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin
(HPBCD), and the solution of MLN4924 was freshly
made every week and stored in dark at room temperature
before use [10, 14].
Four primary ICC cell lines were established using
freshly resected human ICC samples, essentially as
previous described [35]. Each line was validated by its
unique DNA short tandem repeat “fingerprints” matching
that of the patient’s tumor tissue.

Patients and specimens
Paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 322
consecutive ICC patients who underwent primary and
potentially curative resection for their tumor in Liver
Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University
(Shanghai, China) between 2005 and 2011 were selected.
Patients had no signs of distant metastasis nor had
any anticancer treatments before surgery. The clinical
information of these patients is provided Supplementary
Table S1 and also in our previous study [32].
The patient follow-up and postoperative
management were administrated abiding our established
guidelines as described previously [32, 33]. The median
duration of follow-up of the 322 patients was 21.0 months
(range, 3.0-91.5 months; SD, 18.3 months). TTR was
defined as the interval between the date of surgery and
the first recurrence, or from the date of surgery to the
date of last follow-up for the patients without recurrence.
Data were censored at last follow-up for patients without
relapse. The study was approved by the Zhongshan
Hospital Ethics Committee, and informed consent was
obtained from each patient under Institutional Review
Board protocols.

Cell viability assessment and IC50 determination
QBC939 and RBE cells seeded in 96-well plates
with 1500 cells per well in triplicate were treated with
MLN4924 or DMSO for 96 hours. Cell viability was
determined using the ATPliteTM kit (PerkinElmer)
and CCK8 (Dojindo), following the manufacturer’s
instructions and as previously described [14, 16].
For IC50 determination, primary ICC cells were
seeded with 2000-4000 cells per well in 96-well plates
according to the nature of each lines. MLN4924 was
given from 5nM to 50μM serially. Cell viability on day
7 was determined using the ATPliteTM kit (PerkinElmer)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry
Tissue microarrays were constructed as previously
described [32, 33]. Core samples were obtained from
representative regions from each tumor on hematoxylin
and eosin staining. Duplicate 1-mm cores were taken
from different areas of the same tissue block for each case
(tumor tissue and matched noncancerous liver tissue, i.e.,
a total of four cores). Tissue microarrays were constructed
using an arraying machine (Beecher Instruments).
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously
described. Briefly, 4-μm sections were deparaffinized and
subjected to antigen retrieval (citrate buffer, pH=6.0).
Sections were then incubated for 30 min with goat

Clonogenic assay
For clonogenic assay, cells were seeded into
6-well plates (200 cells per well) and cultured for 12

days. The colonies on the plate were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. The
colonies with more than 50 cells were counted.

All procedures were performed in accordance with the
National Institutes of HealthGuide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals.

Propidium iodide staining and fluorescence
activated cell sorting analysis

Statistical analysis

Cells treated with MLN4924 or DMSO were
harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20°C overnight,
and stained with propidium iodide (PI, 36 μg/ml, Sigma)
containing RNAase (10 μg/ml, Sigma) at 37°C for 15
min, then analyzed for apoptosis and cell cycle profile
by CyAnTM ADP (Beckman Coulter) as previously
described [14, 16]. Data were analyzed with ModFit LT
software. Apoptosis was measured by the percentage of
cells in sub-G1 population.

Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
version 18.0 for Windows (IBM). Data were presented
as the mean ± SD. Fisher’s exact, spearman’s correlation
coefficients, and Mann-Whitney U test were used where
appropriate. The relationship between the TTR and
prognostic variables was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier
methods (log-rank test). Univariate and multivariate
analyses were based on the Cox proportional hazard
regression model. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Five-week-old male athymic nude mice were
obtained from the Shanghai experimental animal center
(Shanghai, China). QBC939 cells were trypsinized,
resuspended in PBS and then subcutaneously injected into
groin with 5×106 cells per injection. Three days later, the
tumor bearing mice were randomly divided into 2 groups
(11 mice/group), started to treat with 10% HPBCD or
MLN4924 (60 mg/kg, s.c.), twice a day respectively, on
a 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule for 5 cycles within total
25 days. The size of tumors was measured by Vernier
caliper twice a week. At the end of study, mice were
sacrificed, and tumor tissues were collected, photographed
and weighted. Fresh frozen tumor tissues were used for
immunoblotting assay, and paraffin-embed tissues were
sectioned for immunohistochemistry of Ki-67 and PCNA
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or TUNEL assay (Promega).
