ABSTRACT
Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-homoserine lactone
(C12) as a quorum-sensing molecule for bacterial communication. C12 has also
been reported to induce apoptosis in various types of tumor cells. However, the
detailed molecular mechanism of C12-triggerred tumor cell apoptosis is still unclear.
In addition, it is completely unknown whether C12 possesses any potential therapeutic
effects in vivo. Our data indicate that, unlike most apoptotic inducers, C12 evokes
a novel form of apoptosis in tumor cells through inducing mitochondrial membrane
permeabilization independent of both pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Importantly,
C12 inhibits tumor growth in animals regardless of either pro- or anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins. Furthermore, opposite to conventional chemotherapeutics, C12 requires
paraoxonase 2 (PON2) to exert its cytotoxicity on tumor cells in vitro and its inhibitory
effects on tumor growth in vivo. Overall, our results demonstrate that C12 inhibits tumor
growth independent of both pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and through inducing
unique apoptotic signaling mediated by PON2 in tumor cells.

INTRODUCTION

[6]. C12 decreases the expression of thymidylate synthase
and enhances the activity of chemotherapeutic agents,
5-fluorouracil (5- FU), Tomudex and Taxol in colorectal
and prostate cancer cells. Recently, a derivative of C12,
3-oxo-12-phenyldodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone, has
been identified as another cancer cell growth inhibitor
[8]. Comparative SAR analysis demonstrates that long
acyl side chains with a 3-oxo substitution are essential
for C12′s anti-cancer effect [8]. In light of its function
of triggering tumor cell death, C12 displays promise as a
cancer treatment. However, detailed apoptotic signaling of
C12 remain unclear and whether C12 cytotoxicity in vitro
is relevant to tumor growth in vivo has never been studied.
Resistance toward apoptosis is a hallmark of
most, perhaps all, types of human cancer [9, 10]. Bcl-2
proteins are the major regulators of apoptotic signaling
pathways and can be classified into anti-apoptotic and
pro-apoptotic groups. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such
as Bcl-2 are considered to protect against mitochondrial

Quorum sensing is a bacterial intercellular
communication system that constitutively produces,
releases, and detects small diffusible autoinducers that are
similar to mammalian hormones [1]. The gram- negative
human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses
N-(3- oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (C12) as a
quorum sensing signal [2, 3].
Recent studies have shown that C12 is not only
important in regulating bacterial virulence genes but
also interacts with eukaryotic cells and modulates cell
physiology, such as triggering cell death [4]. C12 has
been demonstrated to cause apoptosis in a variety of
cancer cells [5–8]. C12 induces apoptosis through
inhibiting the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases and Akt/
PKB pathway and diminishing STAT3 activities in breast
carcinoma cells [5]. In pancreatic carcinoma cells, C12
also triggers apoptotic signaling and inhibits cell migration

outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) during
apoptosis, whereas pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members such as
Bax and Bak promote MOMP [11, 12]. The expression
of individual Bcl-2 proteins in different types of cancer
has been used as an independent prognostic marker
[10]. Studies in various human tumors showed that loss
of Bax expression, or increased expression of Bcl-2, are
associated with their resistance to chemotherapy [13–15].
Accordingly, one strategy for cancer therapy is to identify
agonists that activate apoptotic pathway independent of
Bcl-2 proteins in tumor cells [16–18].
As a lactone, C12 is known to be hydrolyzed into a
carboxylic acid by the lactonase paraoxonase 2 (PON2),
which belongs to a gene family (PON1, PON2 and PON3)
with Ca2+-dependent lactonase and arylesterase activities
[19, 20]. In murine airway epithelia, PON2 attenuates
Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing by inactivating
C12 [21]. PON2 and PON3 also display anti-oxidant
and anti-inflammatory functions [22–24]. The detailed
mechanism by which PON2 exerts these effects remains
unknown. Importantly, PON2 expression is markedly
elevated in several human non-small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) cell lines, which is associated with resistance
to classical anticancer drugs like doxorubicin or cisplatin
[23, 24]. In contrast, overexpression of PON2 promotes
C12-induced apoptosis in MEFs and HEK293T cells [25].
To gain insights into the mechanism of C12-evoked
tumor cell apoptosis, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects
of C12 on tumor cells in vitro and the inhibitory effects
of C12 on tumor growth in vivo. The role of pro- and
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and PON2 proteins in C12-induced
apoptosis was systematically examined. C12 inhibited
the tumor growth through inducing apoptosis in a PON2dependent but not Bcl-2 protein-dependent manner. Our
study reveals a unique anti-tumor function of C12, which
may lead to the development of new therapeutic agents
for cancer.

(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1B) compared with
their untransformed counterparts, indicating that C12
induces apoptosis preferentially in transformed cells.
To investigate the relevance of C12 cytotoxicity
on transformed cells to tumor growth in animals, we
examined the effects of C12 on the growth of established
Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumors. As shown in
Figure 1C, transplanted tumors grew much more slowly
in C12-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice, revealing
a dose-dependent anti-tumor activity of C12 as a single
agent. No significant changes of body weight and organ
weight (spleen, kidney, liver, heart and lung) were
observed for C12-treated C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary
Figure 2A and 2C), showing no evidence of significant
toxicities of C12 administration. To test the involvement
of apoptosis in tumor growth inhibition, established LLC
tumors from mice were analyzed for caspase-3 activation
through immunofluorescence staining (Figure 1D–1E),
western blot (Figure 1F–1G) and TUNEL staining
(Figure 1H–1I). The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells
and the levels of activated caspase-3 were higher in tumors
from C12– treated mice than in those of the control group,
suggesting that apoptosis is involved in the inhibitory
activity of C12 in vivo.
In order to explore the therapeutic potential of
C12, we studied the combinatorial effects of C12 and
therapeutic drugs. Cell death of human lung tumor cells
A549 and NCI-H1299 treated with various concentrations
of C12 and the inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL ABT-737 at
a constant dose ratio were measured, and the combination
index (CI) values were determined (Supplementary
Figure 3). As shown in Supplementary Figure 3C and 3F,
in the range of tested drug concentrations, CI values
were smaller than 1, indicating that C12 and ABT-737
exhibited synergistic cytotoxic effects on A549 cells and
NCI-H1299 cells.

cytotoxicity

RESULTS
C12 inhibits lung tumor growth and induces
tumor cell apoptosis in vivo

Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are frequently
overexpressed in human cancers and associated with
chemotherapeutic resistance and relapse [30]. To
investigate the involvement of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
proteins in C12-induced human tumor cell apoptosis,
Bcl- 2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were stably overexpressed in
A549 cells respectively by retroviral infection (Figure 2A
and Supplementary Figure 4A and 4D). The anti-tumor
drug actinomycin D caused less cell death and caspase-3/7
activation in Bcl-2-, Mcl-1- or Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells
than in cells expressing the empty vector (Figure 2B–2C
and Supplementary Figure 4B–4C and 4E-4F). In contrast,
C12 induced similar levels of cell death and caspase-3/7
activation in cells overexpressing Bcl-2, Mcl- 
1 or
Bcl-xL and the vector control cells (Figure  2B– 2C and
Supplementary Figure 4B–4C and 4E–4F). To further

The cytotoxic effects of C12 on tumor cells have
been reported previously [5–8, 26], but whether they
are selective for transformed cells was unknown. To
investigate whether oncogenic transformation influences
the cytotoxicity of C12, we studied normal human
bronchia/tracheal epithelial (NHBE) and corresponding
HBE immortalized and transformed successively by
telomerase, SV40 large T antigen and activated Ras
(H-ras V12) [27–29]. This is a well-established epithelial
cell malignant transformation system related to human
lung cancer. Following C12 treatment, transformed HBE
exhibited higher levels of cell death (Figure 1A and
Supplementary Figure 1A) and caspase-3/7 activation

explore the involvement of Mcl-1 in mediating C12induced cytotoxicity, we examined A549 cells in which
Mcl-1 expression was stably reduced by shRNA [31].
Actinomycin D but not C12 caused more cell death
and caspase-3/7 activation in Mcl-1-knockdown cells
than the cells expressing the control scramble shRNA
(Supplementary Figure 4G–4H), further validating that
Mcl-1 expression is not vital for C12-induced apoptotic
signaling.
MOMP has been recognized to be a “no-return”
step during mitochondria-based apoptotic signaling
[32]. To further investigate C12-initiated apoptosis in
tumor cells, we studied the involvement of Bcl-2 in two
key events of MOMP: depolarization of mitochondrial
membrane potential (∆ψmito) and cytochrome c release.
Depolarization of Δψmito was evaluated by determining
the changes in fluorescence of the voltage-dependent
dye JC1 released from mitochondria into the cytosol and
nucleus. Within minutes of C12 exposure, mitochondria
in A549-vector cells and A549-Bcl-2 overexpressing
cells were depolarized to the same degree (Figure
2D–2E). While depolarizing ∆ψmito quickly, C12 did
not appear to affect mitochondrial morphology with
mitochondrial interconnectivity determined by mean area/
perimeter ratio and mitochondrial elongation measured
by inverse circularity, indicating that mitochondrial
fission/fusion is unlikely involved in the initiation of
MOMP in cells exposed to C12 (Supplementary Videos
1–4 and Supplementary Figure 5). Moreover, C12
caused cytochrome c release from mitochondria in both
A549- vector and Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 over-expressing A549
cells (Supplementary Figure 6A–6B). Taken together,
these results indicate that overexpression of anti- apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins reduces apoptosis in response to the
classical anti-tumor drug actinomycin D but fails to
provide protection against C12.

tumors than vehicle-treated ones regardless of Bcl-2
expression levels (Figure 3C–3D). Overall, these results
show that Bcl-2 is not involved in the cytotoxic effects of
C12 in vitro as well as in vivo.

Bak and Bax are not involved in C12-induced
apoptosis
Previous studies show that C12 induces apoptosis
in MEFs independent of Bak and Bax [25, 34], two
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members required for MOMP in
almost all apoptotic paradigms [35]. To clarify their
role in C12- induced tumor cell apoptosis, human colon
carcinoma HCT116 cell lines lacking Bak alone, Bax
alone, or both Bak and Bax (Bak/Bax-DKO) were studied
(Figure 4A). C12 caused roughly equivalent cell death
and caspase-3/7 activation in all the HCT116 cell lines
examined, indicating that deficiency of Bak and Bax
in HCT116 cells did not influence their responses to
C12 (Figure 4B–4C). Unlike C12, the therapeutic drug
etoposide induced significant cell death and caspase-3/7
activation in wild-type (WT), Bax-KO and Bak-KO but
not in Bak/Bax-DKO HCT116 cells (Supplementary
Figure 7A–7B). Moreover, deficiency in Bak/Bax
expression did not affect C12’s effect to depolarize Δψmito
(Figure 4D–4E) and release cytochrome c (Supplementary
Figure 8), indicating Bak/Bax are not involved in
C12-induced MOMP in tumor cells. These results
demonstrate that C12-induced apoptotic signaling is distinct
from that triggered by conventional anti-cancer drugs.

The inhibitory effects of C12 on tumor growth
are independent of Bak and Bax
To further investigate whether the Bak/Baxindependent effect of C12 to trigger apoptosis in vitro also
occurred in vivo, WT and Bak/Bax-DKO HCT116 cells
were inoculated into athymic nude mice. C12 reduced the
growth of established HCT116-WT tumors and HCT116Bak/Bax-DKO tumors to a similar degree (Figure 5A–5B),
indicating that Bak and Bax are not involved in antitumor activity of C12. Moreover, the level of activated
caspase-3 and the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells
were higher in C12-treated tumors than vehicle-treated
tumors regardless of Bak and Bax expression levels
(Figure 5C– 5F), suggesting that C12 inhibits tumor
growth probably through inducing Bak/Bax-independent
apoptosis. Unlike C12, etoposide inhibited the growth
of WT HCT116 tumors but not that of Bak/Bax-DKO
HCT116 tumors (Supplementary Figure 7C–7D).

C12 blocks tumor growth independent of Bcl-2
protein
To determine whether anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteinindependent C12 cytotoxicity is relevant in vivo, we
examined its effects on the growth of tumors originated
from A549 cells with different levels of Bcl-2 expression
in athymic nude mice. Similarly to C57BL/6 mice,
C12 caused no significant change of body weight and
organ weight (spleen, kidney, liver, heart and lung) in
C12- treated athymic nude mice (Supplementary Figure 2B
and 2D). As shown in Figure 3A–3B, A549– Bcl- 2
overexpressing tumors grew much faster than their
vector control counterparts, which is consistent with the
oncogenic function of Bcl-2 [33]. C12 inhibited the growth
of vector control A549 tumors and Bcl-2-overexpressing
A549 tumors to a comparable degree. Inhibitory effects of
C12 on tumor growth are likely attributed to apoptosis, as
more TUNEL-positive cells were detected in C12-treated

in the BH3 domain, including Noxa and Puma [36]. To
further elucidate whether BH3-only proteins are involved
in C12 cytotoxicity in tumor cells, we investigated two
HCT116 cell lines in which Noxa expression was stably
reduced by shRNA (Figure 6A) or Puma expression was
eliminated genetically (Figure 6E) [37, 38]. C12 caused
similar levels of cell death and caspase-3/7 activation in
HCT116 cell lines with reduced expression of Noxa or

Puma compared with their corresponding counterparts
expressing normal levels of Noxa or Puma (Figure 6B
and 6F–6G). In contrast, less cytotoxicity was observed
in HCT116 cells with decreased Noxa or Puma expression
in response to conventional apoptosis stimuli (Figure 6C
and 6F–6G). Overall, our results suggest that BH3- only
proteins are not critical for C12-induced apoptotic
signaling.

PON2 expression was increased in human lung

transformation enhances PON2 expression.

It has been shown that PON2 upregulation in
some cancer cells, including lung cancer cell lines,
enables cancer cells to become resistant to conventional
therapeutic drugs [23]. To determine whether PON2
expression is enhanced in human lung cancer, we
examined PON2 protein levels in tumor tissues of non
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients by western
blot (Figure 7A). Among eleven samples from patients, we
found that PON2 was overexpressed in eight of lung cancer
tissues compared with corresponding adjacent normal
tissues, whereas its expression was slightly decreased
in three of them (Figure 7B). As Ras- transformed HBE

apoptotic signaling was unclear. To further investigate the
mechanism of C12-triggered apoptosis, we studied the

less cell death and caspase-3/7 activation were observed
in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells lacking PON2 expression
(Figure 8B–8D, 8H and 8J). In contrast, more cell death
and caspase-3/7 activation were detected in PON2deficient cells in response to the common apoptotic
stimuli actinomycin D and tunicamycin (Figure 8B, 8D
and 8I–8J), suggesting that PON2/C12 interaction induces
a novel form of apoptosis distinct from that evoked by
classical apoptotic stimuli. Importantly, C12 inhibited

the growth of vector control A549 tumors but not the
A549 tumors with reduced PON2 (Figure 8E–8F), further
indicating that PON2 is vital for C12 cytotoxicity in vivo.
In addition, similar levels of reduction in cell death and
caspase-3/7 activation were observed in HCT116-WT and
HCT116-Bak/Bax-DKO cells lacking PON2 expression
(Supplementary Figure 9), demonstrating that Bak and
Bax are not involved in PON2-mediated C12 cytotoxicity.
Previous studies indicate that PON2 reduces cellular
oxidative damage and influences redox signaling and
subsequent apoptotic pathways [23, 39, 40]. We investigated
whether C12 modulated the antioxidant activities of PON2.

variation, the relative levels of PON2 were calculated by dividing the PON2 value into the corresponding value for actin. The data were

PON2 expression is increased in tumor tissues. Differential expression of PON2 in tumor versus normal tissues is significant with the value

Consistent with earlier findings, reducing PON2 expression
increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells (Supplementary Figure 10).
However, C12 failed to influence ROS production
regardless of PON2 expression levels, indicating that the
interaction between C12 and PON2 does not modulate the
antioxidant activities of PON2.

MOMP and subsequent apoptosis [48]. Unlike C12,
cytotoxic effects of betulinic acid are influenced by
Bcl- 
2 overexpression and it is ineffective against
epithelial tumors. Similarly, Bak/Bax is also nonessential
in apoptotic signaling induced by chelerythrine [49],
mitochondrial Kv1.3 channels inhibitors [50] or titanium
dioxide (TiO2) [51]. The polyphenolic compound gossypol
evokes Bak/Bax-independent apoptosis and inhibits
Bcl- 2-overexpressing tumor growth [52]. Furthermore,
Bcl-2 expression fails to influence human tumor cell
apoptosis induced by the antibiotic agent Tetrocarcin-A or
protein complex HAMLET [16, 17]. Compared with those
molecules, C12 is the first small molecule compound, to
the best of our knowledge, inducing human tumor cell
apoptosis in vitro as well as blocking tumor growth in vivo
independent of both pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.
The apoptosis cascade induced by C12 in tumor cells
is unique, evident by its rapid pro-apoptotic effects, such
as depolarizing mitochondrial membrane potential within
minutes (Figures 2 and 4), releasing cytochrome c into
the cytosol within three hours (Supplementary Figures 6
and 8) and maximally activating caspases within four
hours (Figure 1). These distinctive pro-apoptotic features
of C12 have not been observed in any other apoptosis
paradigms of cancer cells, which might be attributed to the
ability of C12 or its derivatives generated in tumor cells
to directly permeabilize mitochondria (within minutes)
without the involvement of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
proteins.
This study also shows that endogenous PON2 is
essential for C12‘s cytotoxicity in human lung tumor cells
and inhibitory effects on tumor growth (Figures 8–9),
consistent with our previous observation of PON2
overexpression in nontransformed fibroblasts and
HEK293T cells [25]. The ability of PON3 to restore the
sensitivity of PON2-deficient tumor cells to C12 suggests
that overlapping enzymatic activities of PON2 and PON3
mediate C12 killing activities. In addition, overexpressing
wild-type but not lactonase-deficient PON2 in HEK293T
cells sensitizes them to C12 [25]. These observations raise
the possibility that a secondary, cytotoxic metabolite(s)
of C12 generated by PON2 or PON3 is a more potent
apoptosis inducer, which could be a carboxylic acid
cleavage product of C12 or a molecule generated from
its reaction with other molecules (e.g. phosphorylation).
Future studies are warranted to identify such C12
metabolite(s).
It has been reported that lung tumor cell lines are
resistant to conventional therapeutic drugs partially
due to enhanced expression of PON2, which is thought
to be associated with anti-oxidant activities of PON2
[23, 24]. Our data also show that PON2 expression is
enhanced in lung cancer tissues from NSCLC patients
and human bronchia/tracheal epithelial cells transformed
by an oncogenic Ras allele (Figure 7). Moreover, C12’s
ability to kill NSCLC tumor cells in vitro and block tumor

PON3 expression recovers C12 cytotoxicity in
PON2-deficient tumor cells
PON2 is known to function as a lactonase to cleave
C12 [21, 41, 42]. Therefore, we reasoned that PON2
lactonase activity might be essential for C12 cytotoxicity
on tumor cells. Since PON3 possesses overlapping
enzymatic activities with PON2 to cleave C12 [43], we
investigated whether PON3 could functionally compensate
for the loss of PON2 and re-sensitize tumor cells to C12.
To this purpose, the expression of human or murine
PON3 was stably increased in PON2-deficient A549 and
NCI-H1299 cells using retroviral infection. Western blot
analysis showed that human PON3 and murine PON3
expression was significantly increased (Figure 9A and
9D). Overexpression of human or murine PON3 restored
the sensitivity of PON2-deficient cells to C12, as measured
by the levels of cell death and caspase-3/7 activation
(Figure 9B–9C and 9E–9F). These data further validate the
role of PON lactonase activity in C12-initiated apoptotic
signaling in tumor cells.

DISCUSSION
Despite growing evidence that the bacterial
quorum-sensing molecule C12 induces apoptosis in
various types of human tumor cells [5–8], the relevance
of C12 cytotoxicity to tumor growth in animals was
unknown. Importantly, knowledge about the mechanism
of C12-evoked tumor cell apoptosis has been limited.
Here, we present the evidence that C12 preferentially
triggers transformed cell apoptosis in vitro and inhibits
transplanted tumor growth in vivo as a single agent
independent of both anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.
Furthermore, selective cytotoxicity of C12 on lung tumor
cells and its inhibitory effects on tumor growth are likely
related to upregulated PON2 expression in tumor cells.
Many neoplastic cells show an increased ratio of
anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, which
enables them to survive even under the conditions that
would normally initiate apoptotic signaling [9, 44]. An
emerging strategy for cancer therapy is to overcome
the resistance to apoptosis caused by aberrant Bcl-2
signaling in tumor cells [45–47]. Recently, several small
molecules triggering apoptosis independent of either proor anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have been identified as
potential anti-tumor drugs. Among them, the pentacyclic
triterpenoid betulinic acid induces Bak/Bax-independent

growth in vivo is mediated through PON2 (Figure 8).
These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of C12 on
lung tumor growth in both normal and immunodeficient
nude mice (Figures 3 and 5) could be attributed to PON2
overexpression in tumors. Thus, it is conceivable that
C12 or compounds derived from C12 could trigger rapid
and Bcl-2 protein-independent apoptosis in lung tumors
that are resistant to traditional chemotherapeutic drugs,
whereas normal tissues are spared due to their lower
PON2 expression.
As Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces C12 to
control virulence factors, C12 alone could potentially
promote infections, particularly in immune compromised
patients [20]. Published information about the safety
of C12 in vivo is limited except that C12 exerts acute
influence in immune responses in mice. For instance, C12
reduces innate immune responses acutely via disrupting
TLR4-dependent NF-kB signaling in mice [53]. In a
murine model of dermal inflammation, intradermal
injection of C12-loaded micelles leads to local immune
cell infiltration within 24 hours [54]. In our studies,
administration of C12 for extended periods of time does
not appear to cause significant toxicity to either normal
or immunodeficient athymic nude mice (Supplementary
Figure 2), suggesting that long-term side effects of
administrating C12 on animals might be limited.
Overall, our study reveals that C12 inhibits tumor
growth in animals as a single agent, through inducing a
unique Bcl-2 protein-independent and PON2-mediated
apoptotic cascade in tumors. Therefore, C12 is an ideal
candidate of a lead compound for novel therapeutic agents
for cancer.

Plasmids
The retroviral expression vector pBABE-IRESmKate2 was generated by replacing EGFP cDNA in
pBABE-IRES-EGFP with mKate2 cDNA. Human PON3
cDNA (Sino Biological; China) or murine PON3 cDNA
(Origene; Rockville, MD) was cloned into pBABE-IRESmKate2 to generate pBABE-hPON3-IRES-mKate2 or
pBABE-mPON3-IRES-mKate2. pBABE-hBcl-2-IRESEGFP was generated by cloning human Bcl-2 cDNA
into pBABE-IRES-EGFP. pMIG-hMcl-1-IRES-EGFP
and pMIG-hBcl-xL-IRES-EGFP was a gift from Dr. Levi
Beverly (University of Louisville). The plasmid identities
were validated by sequencing. Lentiviral human PON2
shRNA plasmid was purchased from Santa Cruz.

different levels of Bak and Bax were obtained from
Dr.  Richard Youle (National Institutes of Health).
HCT116 cells stably expressing Noxa shRNA or the
control luciferase shRNA were described previously
[37]. Puma-deficient HCT116 cells were acquired
from Dr.  Bert Vogelstein (John Hopkins University).
NSCLC cell line A549 cells were obtained from ATCC,
which were produced from adenocarcinomic alveolar
basal epithelial cells of a lung cancer patient [56].
NCI-H1299 cells were also acquired from ATCC. A549
cells expressing Mcl- 1 shRNA or control scramble
shRNA were described previously [31]. A549 cells
overexpressing Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 were produced
by retroviral infection as described previously [55].
To generate NCI-H1299 or A549 cells with reduced
PON2 expression or vector control, we infected cells
using respective lentiviral supernatants with 10 µg/ml
polybrene. Stable cell lines were obtained by culturing
cells in the medium containing1.5 mg/ml puromycin. To
express PON3 in NCI-H1299 or A549 cells with reduced
PON2 expression, corresponding cells were infected
with the retroviral supernatants containing 10 µg/ml of
polybrene. NHBE cells were purchased from Lonza
(Walkersville, MD). hT/LT/Ras HBE cells were obtained
from Professor Barrett Rollins (Harvard Medical School).

were cultured as described previously [55]. NHBE and
hT/LT/Ras cells were grown in BEGM supplemented
with SingleQuots (LONZA). HCT116 cells were grown
as described previously [57]. Cells were all cultured in a
5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37°C.

(Ratio at a given time - minimal Ratio) / (maximal ratio minimal Ratio) *100%. Normalized JC1 ratios at plateau
(before addition of FCCP) from different experiments
have been averaged for summary charts.

Cell viability of NCI-H1299 or A549 re-expressing
PON3 cells was measured by TOTO®-3 Iodide using
flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) as described previously
[51]. Cell viability in other studies was determined
by propidium iodide exclusion using flow cytometry
as described previously [55]. The synergistic effect of
C12 and ABT-737 on cell viability was evaluated by
Chou- Talalay median dose effect assay. IC50 of C12 and
ABT-737 on NCI-H1299 or A549 was first determined.
Various combinations of C12 and ABT-737 at a constant
ratio above or below their IC50 values were added to cells.
Following incubation for the indicated time, cell viability
was evaluated and Fa (fractional activity) was determined
as the ratio between the cell death levels of drug-treated
cells and those of untreated control cells. Combination
index (CI) was calculated by the CompuSyn software
(Biosoft; Cambridge, UK).

Mitochondrial morphology
To image mitochondrial morphology and membrane
potential using confocal microscopy, cells were transfected
with mitochondrial matrix-targeted GFP plasmid
(Clontech; Madison, WI) using an Amaxa nucleofector
device (Lonza; Allendale, NJ), seeded onto 35 mm glass
coverslips and placed in a tissue culture incubator. After
16–24 hours coverslips were mounted in a recording
chamber positioned on the stage of an inverted microscope
(IX71; Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA). Cells
were visualized using a PlanApo 60x, 1.42 NA oil
immersion objective and confocal time series images
acquired using a VT-Infinity 3 (VisiTech International;
Sunderland, UK). The chamber was perfused with Hank’s
Balanced Salt Solution containing 20 nM mitochondrial
membrane potential probe tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl
ester (TMRE) at room temperature. After a 15 minute
equilibration period, GFP and TMRE were alternately
excited using the 488 and 568 nm lines respectively of a
Krypon-Argon laser. The emitted fluorescence was filtered
using a dual bandpass filter set (VisiTech International)
and collected and using HCImage software (Hamamatsu
Corporation; Sewickley, PA). Mitochondrial morphology
was analyzed using ImageJ to determine the mean area/
perimeter ratio and inverse circularity as the measurement
of interconnectivity and elongation respectively, as
described previously [59].

Caspase-3/7 activity and TUNEL labeling
Caspase-3/7 activities were measured using a
Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega; Madison, WI) as
described previously [58]. The proluminescent substrate
containing the amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Val-Asp
(DEVD) is cleaved by activated caspase-3/7, leading
to the release of a luciferase substrate (aminoluciferin)
and the generation of luminescent signal. Data were
presented as relative luminescent units (RLU) which were
normalized to the corresponding values of control cells as
an indicator of caspase-3/7 activities. TUNEL labeling was
carried out by the Pathology Research Services Laboratory
at University of Washington. The slides were scanned by
a ScanScope CS digital slide scanner (Aperio; Vista, CA)
and analyzed by ImageJ software (NIH) as described
previously [46].

Immunofluorescence microscopy
For immunofluorescence staining of A549 and
HCT116 cells, cells plated 24 hours earlier were incubated
for 3 hours with either vehicle (DMSO) or 50 µM C12
in Ringer’s solution. The immunofluorescence staining of
cytochrome c was carried out as described previously [55].
Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse Ti confocal
microscope with a 40x CFI Plan Fluor objective (NA 0.6).
To minimize variability, the same microscope settings
were used for all experiments.
For immunofluorescence staining of tumor sections,
tumor sections (5 μm) were treated with antigen retrieval
procedure by boiling in 10% Triton x-100, then slowly
cooled down at room temperature. After incubating with
the blocking buffer (1× PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5%
goat serum), the slides were incubated with antibodies
against activated caspase-3 (Cell signaling) overnight
at 4oC. Following three 10-minute washes, slides were
incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (Alexafluor-568,

Measuring Δψmito using imaging microscopy

Dye- loaded cells were mounted onto a chamber on the
stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a Fluor

imaging measurements of Δψmito were performed as
reported previously [25, 34]. Briefly, a charge coupled
device camera collected JC-1 emission images using filter
wheels (Lambda-10, Sutter Instruments; Novato, CA).

by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). Thirty micrograms of
total protein was electrophoresed in 4–12% Bis/Tris gels
(Bio- Rad; Hercules, CA). PON2 was detected by western
blot as described previously [46].

In vivo animal studies

ROS measurement

For C12 toxicity studies, DMSO or C12 (25 mg/
kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally each day in 8
week-old C57BL/6 mice or in 6 week-old athymic nude
mice. All organs were collected and weighted at sacrifice.
For transplanted tumors in C57BL/6 mice, eightweek old C57BL/6 female mice (Jackson Laboratories;
Bar Harbor, ME) were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.)
with 1×106 Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells on the right
flank. Tumors were measured daily with dull edged
Vernier calipers (V = L × W2/2). After tumor size reached
around 100 mm3, animals with size-matched tumors
were divided into control group and C12 group. DMSO
or C12 was administered intraperitoneally each day.
At the end of the experiments, tumors were excised for
apoptosis evaluation. For the study of transplanted human
tumors, female athymic nude mice (5–7 weeks) were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN).
Wild-type HCT116 cells and Bak/Bax DKO HCT116
cells (3.0 × 107/ml), wild-type A549 cells and Bcl-2overexpressing A549 cells (3.0 × 107/ml), A549-controlshRNA cells and A549-PON2-shRNA cells (3.0 × 107/ml)
were resuspended and mixed 1:1 (vol/vol) with Matrigel
(BD  Biosciences), then 0.1 ml mixture of cells and
Matrigel was injected s.c. on the right flank of mice.
All animals with size-matched tumors were divided
into two groups (control and C12) when the tumor size
reached around 100 mm3. For HCT116 and Bak/Bax
DKO HCT116 tumors, DMSO or C12 was administered
intraperitoneally each day. DMSO or etoposide (40 mg/kg/
day) was administered intraperitoneally once every other
day. For wild-type A549 tumors, animals were treated
with C12 for 6 times/week.  For Bcl-2 over-expressing
A549 cells tumors, DMSO or C12 was administered with
C12 each day. For A549-control-shRNA and A549-PON2shRNA tumors, DMSO or C12 was administered twice
every three days. At the end of the experiments, tumors
were excised for apoptosis evaluation.

A549 or NCI-H1299 cells were cultured in 96-well
white-walled plates (7.5 × 103 per well) for 24 hours.
Cells were subsequently treated with DMSO or 100 µM
CM- H2DCFDA in growth medium for 1 hour at 37oC.
Growth medium was then removed and cells were washed
twice with Ringer’s Buffer. DMSO or 100 µM C12 in
Ringer’s Buffer was added to cells. The fluorescence signal
(Ex/Em = 492 nm/520 nm) was measured kinetically at
37oC using the Gemini EM microplate spectrofluormeter
(Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA). Data was plotted
as relative fluorescence units (RFUs) versus time and
the slope was determined (RFU/min) as an indicator of
intracellular ROS level.
