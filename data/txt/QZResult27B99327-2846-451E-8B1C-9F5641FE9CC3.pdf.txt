ABSTRACT
Although the connection between cancer and cigarette smoke is well established,
nicotine is not characterized as a carcinogen. Here, we used exome sequencing to
identify nicotine and oxidative stress-induced somatic mutations in normal human
epithelial cells and its correlation with cancer. We identified over 6,400 SNVs, indels
and microsatellites in each of the stress exposed cells relative to the control, of
which, 2,159 were consistently observed at all nicotine doses. These included 429
nsSNVs including 158 novel and 79 cancer-associated. Over 80% of consistently
nicotine induced variants overlap with variations detected in oxidative stressed
cells, indicating that nicotine induced genomic alterations could be mediated through
oxidative stress. Nicotine induced mutations were distributed across 1,585 genes,
of which 49% were associated with cancer. MUC family genes were among the top
mutated genes. Analysis of 591 lung carcinoma tumor exomes from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that 20% of non-small-cell lung cancer tumors in
smokers have mutations in at least one of the MUC4, MUC6 or MUC12 genes in contrast
to only 6% in non-smokers. These results indicate that nicotine induces genomic
variations, promotes instability potentially mediated by oxidative stress, implicating
nicotine in carcinogenesis, and establishes MUC genes as potential targets.

INTRODUCTION

	 Nicotine is one of over 4,000 chemicals found
in cigarette smoke. The connection between cancer and
cigarette smoke is well established due to the presence of
a number of carcinogenic substances in cigarette smoke
[4]. However, nicotine is considered as an addictive
substance in cigarette smoke, but not as a carcinogen.
Because nicotine is not yet considered a carcinogen, it
is increasingly being used as a therapeutic. The market
for smoking cessation products that utilizes nicotine is
growing rapidly and expected to reach $2.3 billion by
2016 in addition to nicotine consumption through tobacco
[5]. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
relaxed the restrictions on many nicotine products and
removed the duration-of-use limits, which may signal
to consumers that the consumption of these products is
safe, even for extended periods (Section 918 Report to
Congress, dated 22 April 2013, Department of Health and
Human Services, FDA).
Microarray based studies have shown that a 1mM

The increased incidence of cancer in the last 50-60
years may be largely attributed to two factors: the aging
of the population, and the increased exposure to disease
promoting agents present in general and occupational
environments [1]. There are currently two opposite
interpretations for this growing incidence of cancer. The
first considers that environmental pollutants and chemicals
can only make minor contributions to the overall cancer
incidence and therefore increases in the size and aging of
the population, and lifestyle influences such as smoking,
alcohol consumption and diet can explain most of the
increased cancer incidence [2]. Conversely, the second
interpretation, citing that these arguments are not
sufficient, estimates that in addition to these factors, there
are contributions from the environment such as exposure
to diverse chemical and biological agents, which may play
a major role in the occurrence of the disease [3].

nicotine exposure can suppress immune response and
modulate gene expression of immune system associated
genes, including changes in NF-ĸB [6, 7]. Aberrant
activation of NF-ĸB through oncogenic mutations in
regulatory genes is associated with cancer [8]. Also,
nicotine administration through dermal patches applied
to mice has shown immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory effects at nicotine concentrations lower than
those used in experiments described herein [9]. In a 2007
study, in mice, prolonged nicotine exposure is reported
to be genotoxic, particularly for bone marrow [10]. In
contrast, a 1995 in-vitro assay based study conducted by
the R.J. Reynolds Tabaco Company reported that nicotine
and its major metabolites do not increase the frequency
of mutations and are not genotoxic [11]. Recently, we
have shown that nicotine could promote an environment
for cancer genesis by modulating expression and splicing
patterns of numerous genes [12].
Here, we explored and characterized in depth
the genomic influence of nicotine and its genotoxic
mechanism mediated through oxidative stress, using
massively parallel sequencing in a controlled cell line
experiment. This study suggests that nicotine exposure can
adversely affect the human genome by inducing somatic
mutations and over the period of significant exposure, may
contribute to increased cancer incidence, characterizing
nicotine as a carcinogen or mutagen. We further identified
specific mutation targets that could be used for lung cancer
diagnosis, prognosis and as an indicator for those exposed
to nicotine. Importantly, results presented herein along
with previous publications indicate that the recent action
by the FDA to eliminate duration-of-use limits on nicotine

products may need to be re-evaluated.

RESULTS
Genetic variations induced by nicotine stress
We targeted 201,071 exons (62.2 Mb target
sequence) covering 20,794 genes in nicotine (0.5, 3 and
5mM) and hydrogen peroxide stressed normal breast
epithelial cells, and sequenced them at high coverage
(>50x average). 41 million 150bp reads on average were
generated per sample. Exome enrichment efficiency was
98% (197,839 target exons were on average fully covered).
This enabled 60.9 Mb of target sequences to be analyzed
per sample for stress induced exomic changes, including
single nucleotide, indel, and microsatellite variations.
The comparison of exomic changes indicated that
all sequenced samples (control and experimental) exhibit
between 10,000 and 10,700 non-synonymous single
nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) with respect to the human
genome reference, hg19. This is as expected because
the 1000 genome project (1kGP) estimated that the
typical exome differs from the reference human genome
sequence at 10,000 to 11,000 non-synonymous sites
[13]. This confirms that the samples in our study (control
and experimental) were of good quality and the analysis
criteria used were technically comparable. Further, by
performing the initial experimental scans using this global
microsatellite array that quantitates overall genomewide microsatellite content changes it was possible to

confirm biological and technical reproducibility. These
experiments identified and confirmed overall comparable
genomic changes in multiple independent experiments
with nicotine and oxidative stress (Supplementary Fig.
S1 and S2), thus providing confidence that the detailed
sequencing experiment was being conducted on highly
reproducible alterations induced by stress exposure.
Compared to the unexposed control, we identified a
total of 6,506, 6,610, and 7,138 single nucleotide (SNVs),
indel and microsatellite variations in 0.5, 3 and 5mM
nicotine stressed cells, respectively. These included over
1,200 nsSNVs. In comparison, we identified 6,804 total
variations in hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress) stressed
cells, which included 1,251 nsSNVs, of which 211 were
cancer associated and 191 were predicted as functionally
damaging by Polyphen (Table 1).
To identify only variants consistently present in
different nicotine experiments, we report herein only those
variants that were observed in all three dose experiments.
This resulted in to the identification of 2,159 variants
consistently present in all three experiments compared
to the unexposed control (Table 2). Of these 2,159, 429
were nsSNVs of which 158 were novel (not previously
recorded in dbSNP 137). The COSMIC (Catalogue of
Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database indicated 79 of the
2,159 mutations had an association with cancer. Polyphen
predicted 59 of the nsSNVs to be functionally damaging

(Table 2).
Nicotine exposure showed a slight dose-dependent
effect as indicated by total number of variants detected
in three nicotine dose exposures. However, the number
of variants at the lowest dose were significant in number,
indicating that there exists a possible threshold for
genomic destabilization and nicotine could be genotoxic
at less than LD5 (0.5mM) dose even though it may not be
inducing cell death. Note, the systemic nicotine level in
smokers is reported to be up to 444nM following smoking
[14]. Its daytime average is 99nM and 154nM in blood
while undertaking transdermal nicotine and nasal spray
as a therapy, respectively [15]. The actual concentration
of nicotine from transdermal patches at the skin can be
high, equivalent to 5.1mg/cm2 [16]. Optical absorbance
measurements indicate the nicotine concentration at
skin contact to be greater than 1mM, in agreement the
concentration found 1 mm below the skin surface where
it enters blood vessels [17, 18], thus confirming the range
of doses used in these experiments are physiologically
appropriate.
Overall, 57 to 75 microsatellite loci varied in all
stressed cell cultures compared to the control (Table 1,
Supplementary Table S1). Of variable microsatellites,
eight were consistently detected in all three nicotine
exposure doses. These eight variable microsatellites were
also consistent with that of oxidative stressed exome.

They were distributed as follows: exon (1), intron (1),
3’UTR (5), and intergenic (1). The exomic microsatellite
repeat variation was found in FAM157B, which is a
large gene with unknown function. PRELP, SGPL1, IGJ,
HIATL1, and MIER1 acquired repeat variations in 3’
untranslated regions (3’ UTRs). 3’ UTRs often contain
several regulatory elements that govern the spatial and
temporal expression of mRNA [19]. Although, these are
relatively understudied genes, PRELP and MIER1, both
are associated with leukemia [20, 21].
Nicotine induced somatic mutations (SNVs, indels

and microsatellites) were distributed in 1,585 genes
(Supplementary Table S2). Out of the 1,585 genes,
301 harbored more than one mutation and four of them
contained more than 10 mutations. Of particular note,
several members of the mucin (MUC) family of genes
harbored numerous variations in all samples. Gene
expression alterations in mucin family genes accompany
the development of cancer [22]. Mucins are used as
diagnostic markers in cancer, and are under investigation
as therapeutic targets for cancer [22]. At 5mM nicotine
exposure, MUC4, MUC12, and MUC6 harbored 116, 52,

MUC4, MUC6, and MUC12 mutations in the lung
cancer

and 25 variations, respectively. MUC4, in particular, was
a consistently the top mutated gene upon stress exposures.
It had 99, 110, and 116 variations upon 0.5, 3, and 5mM
nicotine exposure, respectively and 115 variations upon
oxidative stress.

To identify a possible association of MUC4,
MUC6, and MUC12 with lung cancer, we analyzed the
publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
exome sequence data for lung adenocarcinoma and lung
squamous cell carcinoma. We found that 18% (66 of
360) lung adenocarcinoma tumor samples in smokers
had mutations in at least one of these three MUC genes
(p-value ≤0.03), in contrast to just 7% (4 of 58) from
non-smokers. Similarly, 23% (38 of 167) squamous cell
carcinoma tumor samples from smokers had mutations
in at least one of these three MUC genes, whereas no
mutations (0 of 6) were detected in any of three MUC
genes in non-smokers (p-value ≤0.3). Overall, 20% of
all non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumors
in smokers had mutations in at least one of three MUC
genes in contrast to only 6% in non-smokers (p-value
≤0.006) (Supplementary Table S3). Although there was
no correlation between mutation status of these genes
with that of the tumor stage, the significant correlation
of mutation status with the smoking history in patients
reveals a strong potential to exploit these genes in clinical
settings.

Biological implications and potential mechanisms
Polyphen and COSMIC analysis of nicotine
stress-induced somatic mutations revealed a number of
possible biological implications. We performed gene
ontology enrichment analysis of the 1,585 genes mutated.
The PANTHER classification system identified 1,433
genes, of which 21% of the genes were associated with
metabolic and 17% genes were associated with cellular
processes (Fig. 1A). We imported these 1,585 genes into
the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) suite to further
investigate gene-gene interactions, diseases and pathway
associations. IPA identified cancer and gastrointestinal
disease associations with statistical significance (p
<0.05) because of the large number of mutated genes
associated with these diseases (779 and 452, respectively)
(Fig. 1B). It also confirmed the statistically significant
overabundance of genes associated with cancer.
Canonical pathway enrichment analysis in IPA revealed
strong association of these genes with cancer associated
canonical pathways. These included, “molecular
mechanism of cancer, PTEN signaling, Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, pancreatic adenocarcinoma signaling and
hereditary breast cancer signaling” (p<0.05). A number
of genes were also associated with multiple cancer
associated canonical pathways revealing potentially
complex biological interactions and implications (Fig. 2).
“Molecular mechanism of cancer”, a canonical pathway,
shows involvement of 35 mutated genes (Supplementary
Fig. S3).
Increased oxidative stress is a common feature
observed in different types of tumors. Comparing doses
with equivalent impact, LD50 (5mM and 4mM doses of
nicotine and hydrogen peroxide, respectively), we found
that 44% of the somatic mutations were overlapping.
However, of the consistently induced variants at all
nicotine doses, 81% of the SNVs and indels and 100% of
the microsatellite variations were concordant with those
observed in the oxidative stress induced samples (Table 2).
These mutations were distributed in 1,320 unique genes.
Further, we performed pathway and disease association
analysis of genes that were mutated upon oxidative stress
(n=3,760), which confirmed the highest association to
be with cancer (n=1,763) and gastrointestinal disease
(n=1,070). This indicates that nicotine induced genomic
changes are potentially mediated by oxidative stress.

DISCUSSION
Nicotine exposure is pervasive through the use
of tobacco and tobacco cessation therapeutics. Here we
provide evidence that nicotine is a carcinogenic/mutagenic
substance in addition to an addictive one.
The genome-wide view of nicotine-induced somatic
mutations, gene expression changes and mutated cancer
associated genes is concisely presented in the Circos plot
(Fig. 3). In the recent transcriptome sequencing study,
we demonstrated that nicotine exposure differentially
regulates 2015 genes and resulted in alternative splicing
of 173 genes [12]. We observed that 138 of these
differentially expressed and 11 of the alternatively
spliced genes acquired mutations upon nicotine
exposure as detected in the present study. Both studies
identify statistically significant cancer-associated genes
differentially expressed and/or mutated upon nicotine
exposure. However, none of the mutated MUC genes were
reported as differentially expressed in transcriptome study
indicating that expression level changes of the altered
MUC transcripts (and presumably proteins) may not be
associated with nicotine or oxidative stress. Note that
these studies utilize the identical model cell line, nicotine
concentration and experimental control, which makes
results uniquely comparable as outlined previously [23].
We also analyzed microsatellite variations
since microsatellites are known to have a role in faster
adaptation to environmental stresses [24]. Microsatellites
4793

are among the most variable types of DNA sequence in
the genome and represents ~3% of the genome, which is
twice the coding region [25]. Under nicotine and oxidative
stress, approximately 50-70 (0.3%) of the microsatellite
loci varied, and were independent of dose. In comparison,
we observed on average ~6,000 SNPs in the 62 Mbases
sequenced in each exome, or about 0.01% of the bases
varied. Thus, in this study, microsatellite loci were ~30
times more mutable than single nucleotide polymorphisms,
consistent with previous reports of elevated microsatellite
mutability. Thus, microsatellite variability may be a more
sensitive measure of the genomic response to cell stress.
Nicotine-induced somatic mutations were
concordant with those induced by oxidative stress.
Nicotine has been previously reported to induce oxidative
stress in cultured cells [26]. Further, cells in tissues and
organs are continuously subjected to oxidative stress and
free radicals, which may be of exogenous or endogenous
(intracellular) origin. The cells withstand these processes
via several different defense mechanisms; ranging from
free radical scavengers (glutathione (GSH), vitamins C
and E and antioxidant enzymes like catalase, superoxide
dismutase and various peroxidases) to sophisticated and
elaborate DNA repair mechanisms such as base excision
repair [27]. Therefore, the intensity of nicotine stress
induced genomic damage on an individual basis varies
depending on the dynamic equilibrium of the above factors
and may be greatly reduced with a healthy lifestyle and
better food consumption habits. This may also partially
explain why individual smoker’s susceptibility of cancer
may vary.
Previous studies have demonstrated that nicotine
and its metabolites bind to nAchR subunits, which
may mediate the carcinogenic effects [28]. It has been
suggested that nicotine could cause cell proliferation
through Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway [29].
However, at this point, it is unclear whether nicotine
exerts its mutagenic effect either through activating
downstream signaling pathways or its conversion to a
carcinogenic substance. Further, carcinogenic substances
often induce transversions (Conversion of G to T). In our
study, 5% of the variations measured were transversions
(104 out of 2,158 mutations), which suggests this possible
carcinogenic characteristic of nicotine.
We subjected cells to a single pulse of nicotine at
doses up to LD50 to document the extreme of physiological
and genotoxic effects. However, long-term exposures
(ranging from months to years) at lower concentrations,
identical to those found in the plasma after smoking, may
be warranted to evaluate the consequences of sustained
nicotine consumption. These higher doses, applied as a
time pulse, more resembles the local dose experienced
by those cells in direct contact with the nicotine patch
or spray. Additional studies that better emulate the time
course for an average nicotine cessation program should
be conducted, as would studies on other epithelial cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lines to characterize long-term effect of nicotine cessation
therapy that includes nicotine patches, nasal sprays and
“vapor” cigarettes. In addition, epidemiological studies
involving analysis of a substantial number of human
genomes are warranted to uncover the biological impact
of continued nicotine consumption on human health.
A key area of cancer research is to identify and
investigate genetic and epigenetic alterations occurring
during cancer development that may serve as clinical
tools for disease diagnosis and prognosis. We identified 79
consistently occurring mutations that are cancer associated
per the COSMIC database. Additionally, exposure induced
429 nsSNVs that may have functional significance.
Together, these suggest that nicotine exposure results
in many reproducible genetic variations that drive cells
towards the cancer state. Of particular note, we observed
frequent mutations in a number of MUC family genes,
in particular MUC4. Previous studies have associated
differential MUC4 expression with a number of cancers,
including pancreatic, lung, breast, gall bladder, salivary
gland, prostate and ovarian cancer, indicating that MUC4
may be a good candidate as a diagnostic and prognostic
marker [30]. For example, in one breast cancer study,
silencing MUC4 led to reduced expression of HER2,
although the molecular mechanism of this interaction is
unknown [31]. Over-expression of HER2 occurs in 30% of
breast cancers and has been used effectively as an adjuvant
therapy drug target in these patients [32].
MUC4 exhibits a pattern of positive selection under
nicotine and oxidative stress as indicated by the positive
ratio of nonsynonymous SNVs/ synonymous SNVs (1.7 to
2.3 in all experimental samples). Stress-induced selection
pressure on genes is reported to play an important role in
evolution [33, 34]. However, the functional significance
of positive selection of MUC4 upon nicotine or oxidative
stress is unclear at this time.
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer
related death [35], which is frequently caused by longterm exposure to tobacco smoke [36]. We correlated the
mutation frequency of MUC4, MUC6, and MUC12 with
the non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and identified a distinct
mutation frequency in tumor samples from smokers (20%)
and non-smokers (6%), which cumulatively designates
these MUC genes as diagnostic and prognostic markers
in smokers. It is interesting to note here that MUC genes
were not previously reported as the most frequently
mutated genes in lung cancer [37]. Because large
genome based population scale studies are dominated
by frequently mutated genes and their ranked correlation
with clinical metadata, it is possible to overlook the
impact of an individual gene or a family of genes and
their experimental validations. It would be interesting to
explore mutation frequencies of MUC genes in germline
samples of lung cancer patients that may pre-dispose them
to cancer. Further, the study of MUC gene alterations may
be warranted in recurrent tumors that were previously

exposed to chemotherapy and radiation since both of these
would be inducing extreme stress at the cellular level.
In summary, this study utilized an unbiased
next-generation sequencing approach to investigate
somatic exomic variants induced in response to
exposure of nicotine and oxidative stress. It reveals
that nicotine exposure causes somatic mutations, which
are substantially concordant with those induced from
oxidative stress and implicates nicotine in carcinogenesis/
mutagenesis. Further, we identified MUC4, MUC6, and
MUC12 as consistent mutation target genes for nicotine
and oxidative stress. We discovered that 14% of the nonsmall-cell lung cancer tumors in smokers have mutations
in at least one of three MUC genes establishing MUC
family genes as strong genetic marker for nicotine stress
in smokers and for diagnosis and prognosis in the lung
cancer.

Each array consists of 41,430 unique repeat probes,
each replicated 3-5 times at different positions across
the array, for 125,300 probes (features), from which data
were obtained. The design included probes to measure all
possible cyclic permutations of repeat units from 1-mer
to 6-mer, and a variety of controls. Additionally, 7-mer
probes were included though this set is not a complete
set of all possible cyclic permutations due to array size
constraints. All arrays were manufactured by Roche
Nimblegen following their standard production methods
for maskless photolithography. All DNA test samples
were labeled, hybridized to array and scanned in pairs,
always including one standard. The data extraction was
performed by Roche Nimblegen‘s standard protocol for
aCGH arrays. Array data analysis of the raw hybridization
intensities was performed locally. Briefly, a custom pearl
script was used to calculate a z-score for each motif
family, including replicates and cyclic permutations,
followed by the calculation of average and standard
errors for each motif family using all replicates and
cyclic permutations that a pass z-score cutoff (1.64) for
significance. Processed data for each array represented
3,304 unique microsatellites motif families and their
intensity values, which themselves were proportional
to the global microsatellite content in a given genome.
Further, data were log transformed and mean normalized.
Then, experimental samples were compared to their
respective controls to determine global microsatellites
content changes. The data processing, analysis, and
hirechial clustering was done using Gene Spring v.
11.5 data analysis software (Agilent). Commercially
available Promega human female DNA was used as a
control to gauge reproducibility of this array. All motifs
continuously monitored in the control DNA confirmed the
array reproducibly (R2 ≥0.99) when samples were run on
three different arrays and compared. Additionally, we have
previously demonstrated array specificity and sensitivity
by demonstrating the ability of the array to detect EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) transformation within cell line samples
by detecting EBV’s singular and specific microsatellite
motif/locus GAGCAG [38]. Together, these confirm very
high confidence in the sensitively and reproducibly of
array experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents, chemicals, and cell culture
MCF-10A cells were obtained from American type
culture collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured in DMEM/
F12 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with horse serum
(5% final, Invitrogen), Pen/Strep (1% final, Invitrogen),
EGF (20ng/ml final, Peprotech), hydrocortisone (0.5mg/
ml final, Sigma), cholera toxin (100ng/ml final, Sigma),
and insulin (10ug/ml final, Sigma) at 370C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. Nicotine was
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.).

Experiments
Twenty-four hours before application of nicotine
and hydrogen peroxide, cells were seeded at a density
of approximately 3x105 cells/well in 6-well plates or
5x107/ 500cm2 cell culture dishes. Nicotine was diluted in
complete culture media at required final concentrations.
Dose ranging experiments were carried out in six well
plates. Nicotine was applied for a range of doses on cells
for 72hrs and at the end of the exposure period, the number
of live cells were measured with a cell counter (Biorad).
We used 5mM (~LD50), 3mM (~LD25) and 0.5mM (~LD5)
doses of nicotine and 4mM (~LD50) for hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2). Dose for nicotine experiments were within the
range of previously reported studies [7, 12]. All isolated
DNAs were tested for quality and DNA samples with
260/280 ratio over 1.8 were used for exome sequencing.

using a Covaris M220 to 400bp. A gel-free method
recommended in the protocol was used to prepare the
library. The ends were repaired and an ‘A’ base was added

to the 3’ end, which prepares the DNA fragments for
ligation to the adapters that have a single ‘T’ base overhang
at their 3’ end. The adapters enable PCR amplification and
hybridization to the flow cell. The library generated was
validated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantitated
using Quant-iT dsDNA HS Kit (Invitrogen; Carlsbad,
CA). Exome enrichment was performed using a TruSeq®
Exome Enrichment Kit (FC-121-1024; Illumina). Samples
were pooled (500ng each) and enriched following the
manufacturer’s standard protocol. Enriched samples were
quantitated based on Quant-iT dsDNA HS Kit (Invitrogen)
and qPCR.
Libraries were clustered onto a flow cell using
TruSeq® Rapid PE Cluster Kit – HS (PE-402-4001), and
sequenced for 150 cycles pair-end using TruSeq® Rapid
SBS Kits – HS (FC-402-4001) on HiSeq 2500®. Reads
that passed the Illumina chastity filter were kept. Reads
passed the chastity filter if they had, within the first 25
cycles, no more than one cycle of a chastity below 0.6
(Chastity = Highest intensity/(Highest intensity + Next
highest intensity)). An average of 41.4 million high quality
150bp reads (passed Chastity filter) were generated from
exome-enriched samples equivalent to 6.2 billion DNA
bases per exome. We opted for longer (400bp) DNA
fragments for library preparation and longer read length
(150bp) for sequencing to enhance the quality and results,
especially within repeat regions.

considered as stop-gain variants. Variants that eliminated
stop codon at the variant site were considered as stoploss variants. All identified variations were annotated
for a variety of characteristics and analyzed. The Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP 137) was
used to check for novel variants. Polyphen 2.0 was used
to predict the functional impact of non-synonymous
variations [45] (We considered high confident predictionsvariations that were identified by Polyphen as “Possible
damaging”); The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in
Cancer (COSMIC) database v64 was used to identify
somatic cancer variants [46]. The PANTHER classification
system was used for gene ontology enrichment analysis
[47]. Gene network and pathway analysis was done
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Circos plot was
generated with the R statistical software using RCircos
package [48]

Analysis of lung cancer data from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset
As of 1 November 2013, The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) contained exome sequence data for 499
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples and 493 Lung
squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tumor samples. These
are subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer, one of the most
common types of lung cancer. We downloaded the clinical
metadata and somatic mutations for the LUAD and LUSC
sets from TCGA Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.
gov/tcga/). The somatic mutation file only listed the
mutations contained in the tumor samples. Using custom
perl scripts, we analyzed the data for each tumor sample
and correlated metadata (individual smoking history) and
mutations (including MUC4, MUC6, and MUC12). We
only considered the 591 samples (418 LUAD and 173
LUSC) for which smoking history was provided and there
was at least one mutation identified in the tumor sample.
This allowed us to ensure that all samples included in the
analysis were also included in the mutation calls provided
by TCGA. Further, we grouped these samples according
to the pathological stage reported as metadata to correlate
tumor grade with the mutation status of MUC genes. R
statistical software was used to compute p-values with the
fisher.test function for a two-by-two matrix set with the
alternative hypothesis as “two.sided”.

SNVs, indels, and microsatellite calling from
exome sequencing data
We aligned sequence reads to the human genome
reference, hg19, using BWA and obtained an average
sequence coverage of 50.7x per sample on targeted exomic
regions. Reads were locally realigned around Indels, and
raw variants (Single nucleotide variations and Indels)
were called using GATK Unified Genotyper [39, 40]. We
filtered variants with a minimum read depth of ≥5x and
mapping quality >30 as a final acceptable variant call. This
method has shown >90% of true positives in other studies
[41]. We used microsatellite specific genotyping software
that requires a minimum of 15 reads completely spanning
a locus in order to call the genotype for each sample [42,
43]. This method has shown to have a 95% accuracy.
This analysis enabled the calling of on average 22 820
microsatellite loci from each exome-sequenced sample.
