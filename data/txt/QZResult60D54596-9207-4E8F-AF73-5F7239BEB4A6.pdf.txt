ABSTRACT
The RAS-related signalling cascade has a fundamental role in cell. It activates
differentiation and survival. It is particularly important one of its molecules, B-RAF.
B-RAF has been a central point for research, especially in melanoma. Indeed, it lacked
effective therapeutic weapons since the early years of its study. Molecules targeting
B-RAF have been developed. Nowadays, two classes of molecules are approved
by FDA. Multi-target molecules, such as Sorafenib and Regorafenib, and selective
molecules, such as Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib. Many other molecules are still under
investigation. Most of them are studied in phase 1 trials. Clinical studies correlate
B-RAF inhibitors and QT prolongation. Though this cardiovascular side effect is not
common using these drugs, it must be noticed early and recognize its signals. Indeed,
Oncologists and Cardiologists should work in cooperation to prevent lethal events,
such as fatal arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. These events could originate from
an uncontrolled QT prolongation.

INTRODUCTION

stimulates neoplastic cell proliferation and decreases
apoptosis [1, 2].
Throughout the years, multi-target drugs inhibiting
either only BRAF or including BRAF have been
developed. In this review, we discuss about those drugs
suppressing BRAF, which have been approved by the
FDA. They are sorafenib (2005), vemurafenib (2011),
regorafenib (2012) and dabrafenib (2013). Besides, we
discuss about other drugs in development, which have not
yet been approved (Table 1).

Over the years the development of more and more
advanced technology, applied in molecular biology, has
led to the production of new molecules and an increasing
use of targeted therapies. These molecules can selectively
inhibit the related targets. Researchers studied extensively
those targets involved in the cellular signalling pathway
RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK.
RAF and its isoforms, especially the serine/
threonine kinase BRAF, are commonly activated by
somatic point mutations in human cancers. BRAF
mutations are frequently observed in melanoma and in
colorectal cancer. Activating mutations in BRAF upregulate the downstream signalling pathway. This event

GTPase, which interchanges the active GTP-bound state
with the inactive GDP-bound state. It is the starting point
of a pathway that transmits mitogenic signals from the
plasma membrane to the nucleus. So, it stimulates cell
differentiation and survival. The RAS family includes
H-RAS, N-RAS and K-RAS proteins. Activating
mutations of specific codons in these clinically relevant
isoforms of RAS determine malignant transformation.
They are present in a variety of human cancers. These
RAS proteins are activated by growth factor receptors
and stimulate their ultimate effectors through various
signalling pathways. The most important pathways are the
RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K)/PTEN/Akt pathway.
The first signal transduction pathway is also called
the MAPK cascade. The RAF kinases and their effectors,
MEK and ERK kinases, stimulate cell proliferation or
differentiation in relation to the intensity and time duration
of the signal. RAF serine/threonine kinase has various
isoforms, which include ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF, also
called Raf-1. RAF kinases interact with the GTP-bound
RAS, leading to the RAF protein kinase activation.
The activated RAF phosphorylates and stimulates the
kinase MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates
the kinase ERK. This sequence of events triggers

transcriptional regulators that activate a wide variety of
cellular phenomena, such as cell cycle progression and
cell proliferation [3-7].
The second signal transduction pathway, PI3K/
PTEN/Akt, stimulates survival. PI3K is a heterodimeric
protein with a regulatory subunit, p85, and a catalytic
subunit, p110. When p85 binds other molecules, it is
released by the inhibition of p110. PI3K localizes to the
plasma membrane and it phosphorylates its substrate,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P2) on
the 3’OH position to produce PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4,5)
P3 drags close to it, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
1(PDK1) and Akt. PDK1 activates Akt by phosphorylating
it at threonine 308. After activation, Akt leaves the cell
membrane to phosphorylate intracellular substrates.
Besides, it translocates to the nucleus where it stimulates
several transcriptional regulators, including CREB, E2F
and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). NF-κB is localized in the
cytosol constitutively linked to the inhibitory κ B protein
kinase (IκB). Under activation NF-κB is translocated to
the nucleus, where it stimulates the expression of several
target genes, inducing cell proliferation, invasion and
inflammation. Akt is involved in cell cycle progression
and migration, survival, senescence, invasion, metastasis,
drug resistance and DNA damage repair [8-15]. These two

signal transduction pathways can interact between them
and with other pathways.
BRAF mutations are frequently detectable in
melanoma (50-60% of cases), papillary thyroid cancer
(40-60%), colorectal cancer (about 5-10%), pilocytic
astrocytoma (10-15%) and non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC; 3-5%). They are also present in low percentage
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in sarcoma, ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer and liver
cancer. The six most frequent BRAF mutations are
V600E, V600K, V600R, V600E2, V600D, and K601E.
They are about the 95% of all BRAF mutations (COSMIC
database). Among these, the most common BRAF
mutation is a T1799A transversion mutation in exon 15,
which has been discovered in more than 90% of BRAF35591

mutant tumors. This mutation determines a substitution
from the amino acid valine to glutamic acid within the
activation segment of the kinase. It is also called V600E.
In addition, the T1799A alteration can even be associated
with a second nucleotide mutation, G1798A. It leads to
a V600K mutation. This mutation entails a constitutional
activation of the kinase protein. So, BRAF targeting may
be an incisive therapeutic tool for BRAF mutated patients.
The aim of BRAF inhibitors is to suppress the hyperactivation of the signalling pathway given by the mutation
of BRAF, limiting the excessive cell proliferation and
balancing proliferation and apoptosis [2, 16-19].

investigational drug. Among these patients one cardiac
ischemic event led to permanent discontinuation of
study drug. All grade hypertension was reported in 17%
(seventy-eight patients), of which 4% had grade 3 or 4
hypertension. A larger population was then studied in
North America through an expanded access program, in
which about 2.504 patients were enrolled. The incidence
of all-grade hypertension was 12%, and 5% was grade
3 hypertension. Schmidinger et al. in an observational,
single-center study, evaluated cardiac toxicity in eighty-six
patients affected by metastatic RCC. These patients were
treated with either Sunitinib or Sorafenib. Among these
patients only seventy-four of them were eligible for the
study, 33.8% among them experienced a cardiac event (25
patients), 40.5% had ECG changes (30 patients, of which
12 experienced a cardiac event while 18 did not experience
a cardiac event) and 18% were symptomatic (13 patients).
However these valuations included both treatments.
Giving a closer look to the Sorafenib-treated patients,
it is possible to highlight that 14 patients experienced a
cardiovascular event (56% upon the whole of 25 patients).
Besides, among these 14 patients, six patients had ECG
changes. Eight patients had symptoms likely related to
myocardial damage. Furthermore, the use of Sorafenib led
to cardiac ischemia in 3% of patients [9, 23-25].
The recent prospective, open-label, noninterventional, non-controlled, multicenter study
conducted in 18 countries, which is called PREDICT
study, enrolled 2855 patients with advanced RCC. All of
them were treated with Sorafenib. It registered, among the
drug-related adverse events, only hypertension, which was
present in 4.2% (110 patients) [26].
It is more recent the phase 3 trial, which led to the
approval of Sorafenib in locally advanced or metastatic
differentiated thyroid cancer. The DECISION trial is a
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study, in which patients were assigned on a 1:1 basis to
Sorafenib or placebo, so 207 patients were randomised in
the Sorafenib-arm. Any grade hypertension was present
in 40.6% (84 patients), of which 9.7% was grade 3 (20
patients), while no grade 4 hypertension was registered.
As regards dyspnoea, any grade was highlighted in 14.5%
(30 patients), grade 3 in 4.8% (10 patients). No grade 4
dyspnoea was registered. Among serious adverse events
occurring in 2% or more of patients receiving Sorafenib,
there was dyspnoea in 3.4% (7 patients among 207).
One death, in the Sorafenib group, was attributable to
myocardial infarction [27].
Many other studies evaluated the safety profile of
Sorafenib compared to either placebo or another drug
(including sunitinib, axitinib, brivanib, tivozanib, dovitinib
and linifanib). All the studies reported hypertension, all
grade hypertension ranging from 17.5% to 34% (with a
mean value of about 26%). More heterogeneous values
were recorded as regards grade 3/4 hypertension ranging
from 1% to 18% (with a mean value of about 10%). Most

CARDIOTOXICITY OF BRAF INHIBITORS
Sorafenib
To date, Sorafenib has been approved by the
FDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), patients with advanced/
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and patients with
locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated
thyroid carcinoma (DTC) which is refractory to radioactive
iodine treatment. It is an oral drug. It inhibits multiple
intracellular and cell surface kinases including VEGFR-2,
VEGFR-3, RET (including RET/PTC), CRAF, BRAF and
its mutant forms (including BRAFV600E), c-KIT, FLT-3 and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β).
There are three main phase 3 trials, which studied
sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC, SHARP and
Asia-Pacific trial, and unresectable and/or metastatic
RCC, TARGET trial. These studies showed that among
the several side effects, sorafenib gives a certain level
of cardiotoxicity, mainly hypertension. In the SHARP
trial, Llovet et al. studied a huge population of patients
with advanced HCC. Data showed that any grade
hypertension was present in 5% of patients (among the
297 patients in the sorafenib-arm), among them 2% had
grade 3 hypertension, while no grade 4 hypertension was
registered. Cardiac ischemia or infarction was revealed
in 3% of patients. To achieve regulatory approval also in
China, sorafenib had to be examined, in a parallel study, in
about 200 patients with HCC from the Asia-Pacific region.
This study highlighted that all grade hypertension was
present in 18.8% (twenty-eight patients) and among them
2% had grade 3 or 4 hypertension. The incidence of heart
attack or cardiac ischemia occurring during treatment in
sorafenib-treated patients was 2.7% [9, 20-22].
Sorafenib was firstly studied in advanced RCC in
the TARGET trial. 451 patients were assigned to receive
continuous treatment with sorafenib and compared to the
placebo-arm. In this study twenty-two patients (4.9%)
were assigned to the sorafenib-arm. They reported cardiac
ischemia/infarction and six events were correlated to the

of these studies registered asthenia, all grade asthenia
ranging from 11.4% to 17% (mean value of about 14%)
and grade 3/4 asthenia ranging from 2.1% to 5% (mean
value of about 3.5%). Very few cases led to discontinuation
of treatment with Sorafenib. The studies also reported
other cardiovascular adverse events that were present in
low percentage or in individual cases, such as myocardial
ischemia, cardiac failure, pulmonary embolism, peripheral
edema and cerebrovascular accidents. Two studies
reported dyspnoea but they registered very different
percentages. One of them reported all grade dyspnoea in
9% of patients of which 2% had grade 3/4. The other one
reported all grade dyspnoea in 20% of patients, of which
7% had grade 3/4 [28-36].
Similar results about hypertension were observed
in a meta-analysis by Funakoshi T et al. All grade
hypertension was present in 23.1% of patients. High-grade
hypertension occurred in 6.0% [37].
Another meta-analysis by Choueiri et al. evaluated
the incidence and the risk of arterial thromboembolic
events (ATEs) linked to Sorafenib. ATEs had an incidence
by 1.7%, while it was calculated an RR of ATE by 3.1
[38].
In a phase 1 open-label study Tolcher et al. analysed
the cardiovascular safety of Sorafenib. They evaluated
the baseline and the variations of QTc interval, together
with other parameters such as left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF), blood pressure and heart rate. Thirtyone patients, after one cycle of Sorafenib treatment,
showed a modest prolongation of the QT/QTc interval.
They registered mean increases from baseline by 9.0 and
4.2 milliseconds (ms) respectively for QTcF and QTcB.
None of the patients had a QTcB or QTcF value >500 ms
at any time of the study. Besides none of them showed
a change from baseline in QTcB or QTcF ≥60 ms. Only
one patient had a prolongation in either QTcB or QTcF
that was a +50 ms change from QTcF baseline. Besides,
this study highlights that there are few cases in which the
mean maximal increases from baseline can be of 16 ms for
QTcB and 20 ms for QTcF. This was showed in continuous
treatment with Sorafenib. So these results reveal that there
is no clinically relevant effect of Sorafenib on cardiac
repolarization, if it is used at therapeutic doses (400 mg
BID) [39].
Sorafenib was firstly created to inhibit RAF kinases.
It strongly acts on Raf-1 and BRAF more than the other
targets it has. This could be underlined taking a look to
the IC50 it has towards its targets. IC50 is the half maximal
inhibitory concentration at which the compound reaches
half of its maximal inhibitory effect. Raf-1 is affected with
a mean IC50 of 6 nM with a standard deviation (SD) of ± 3;
BRAF wild-type: 25 ± 6; its mutant form BRAFV600E: 38
± 9; VEGFR-2: 90 ± 15; murineVEGFR-2 (flk-1): 15 ± 6;
mVEGFR-3: 20 ± 6; mPDGFR-β: 57 ± 20; Flt-3: 58 ± 20;
c-KIT 68 ± 21. A study evaluated the interaction between
several kinases and thirty-eight kinase inhibitors. In this
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

study Sorafenib strongly bound to 38% of the tyrosine and
11% of the serine/threonine kinases. The kinase binding
dissociation constant (Kd - which is commonly used to
describe the affinity between a ligand and a protein) was
less than 3 μM. This concentration is under therapeutic
plasma levels. Besides, only 16% of the tyrosine kinases
and 1% of the serine/threonine kinases bound Sorafenib
with a Kd of less than 100 nM. This is the value under
which there is a greater binding affinity between the drug
molecule and the ligand. In fact, the lower the value of
Kd is the higher the binding affinity will be, and vice
versa. So, even though sorafenib was initially described
as a potent inhibitor of RAF serine/threonine kinase, it
preferably binds tyrosine kinases and in some cases with
affinities within ten-fold of that for its expected primary
target [40-42].

Regorafenib
The kinase inhibitor Regorafenib has been approved
for the treatment of patients affected by metastatic
colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients already treated with
fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based
chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and also an antiEGFR therapy, if the patients have a wild type KRAS
mutational status. It has also been approved for locally
advanced, unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST) in patients who have been
previously treated with imatinib mesylate and sunitinib
malate. Regorafenib is a small molecule. It inhibits several
membrane-bound and intracellular kinases involved both
in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes
such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance
of the tumor microenvironment. It suppresses the action
of several targets such as RET, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2,
VEGFR-3, KIT, PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, FGFR-1, FGFR-2,
TIE2, DDR2, TrkA, Eph2A, Raf-1, BRAF and its mutant
form BRAFV600E, SAPK2, PTK5, and Abl [43-45].
There are two main phase 3 trials that led to the
approval of regorafenib by the FDA. The CORRECT
trial studied patients affected by metastatic CRC. The
GRID trial studied patients affected by advanced GIST.
In the CORRECT trial, among the 500 patients treated by
regorafenib, the most present cardiovascular side effect
was hypertension. Any grade hypertension emerged in
28% of the patients, grade 3 hypertension emerged in
7% of the patients, while no grade 4 hypertension was
highlighted. The other cardiovascular side effect, which
came to light, was dyspnoea. Any grade dyspnoea was
present in 6% of patients (28 patients) including only
one patient experiencing grade 3 dyspnoea (< 1%). No
grade 4 dyspnoea was reported. Among patients assigned
to regorafenib-arm, 12 patients (2%) had thromboembolic
events. Besides, regorafenib increased the incidence of
myocardial ischemia and infarction 1.2% versus 0.4%
in the placebo-arm. In the GRID trial, 132 patients were

treated with regorafenib. Among them 48.5% had any
grade hypertension (64 patients), 22.7% presented grade 3
hypertension (30 patients), while only one patient (0.8%)
had grade 4 hypertension. So, among grade ≥3 side effects,
hypertension was the most common (23.5%). This adverse
event could be managed with dose modification and
appropriate anti-hypertensive intervention. One patient,
in the regorafenib-arm, had cardiac arrest, which was
considered by the investigators a grade 5 adverse event
drug-related [9, 46-48].
Regorafenib has also been studied for advanced
HCC in a phase 2 trial. It reported any grade hypertension
in 36% of the patients (13 patients), of which one patient
(3%) had grade ≥3 hypertension. One patient (3%) had
grade ≥3 arrhythmia, which led to discontinuation of
treatment[49, 50].
In an open label, single arm study, 25 patients with
advanced solid tumors assumed regorafenib at multiple
doses. In this study the effect of multiple doses on the QTc
interval was evaluated. No large changes in the mean QTc
interval (> 20 msec) were detected in the study.
Regorafenib is biochemically similar to sorafenib
but essentially different, by showing a more powerful
inhibition on oncogenic kinases. This aspect emerges
from its biochemical profile, namely the IC50 on each
target kinase. VEGFR-1 has an IC50 of 13 nM with a SD
of ± 0.4, murineVEGFR-2: 4.2 ±1.6, murineVEGFR-3:46
± 10, TIE2: 311 ± 46, PDGFR-β: 22 ± 3, FGFR-1:
202 ± 18, KIT: 7 ± 2, RET: 1.5 ± 0.7, Raf-1: 2.5 ± 0.6,
B-RAFwt: 28 ± 10, BRAFV600E: 19 ± 6. These target
kinases were also analyzed in mechanistic cellular
phosphorylation assays. They evaluated the inhibition of
receptor auto-phosphorylation in cells, which expressed
FGFR, PDGFR-β, BRAF, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, TIE2.
Regorafenib potently inhibited VEGFR-2 and TIE2 autophosphorylation in cells with an IC50 respectively by 3 nM
and 31 nM. It inhibited PDGFR-β auto-phosphorylation
with an IC50 of 90 nM, while FGFR signalling with a value
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of about 200 nM. Finally, the inhibition of the MAPK
signalling pathway was evaluated using tumor cells, which
expressed wild-type KRAS and BRAF, and in melanoma
cell line BRAFV600E mutated. The first ones had an IC50 by
380 nM, while the second ones had an IC50 by 272 nM.
So, the potency of inhibition from regorafenib expressed
in the cellular assays was correlated to the one showed in
biochemical assays, with some exceptions. TIE2 showed
an inhibition of about 10-fold weaker in biochemical
assays than the cellular auto-phosphorylation assay. On the
contrary, BRAF and BRAFV600E highlighted an inhibition
of about 14-fold stronger in biochemical assays than the
cellular auto-phosphorylation assay [51, 52].

Vemurafenib
Vemurafenib is a kinase inhibitor. It has been
approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable
or metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600E mutation. It is
an orally administered drug, which potently inhibits some
BRAF serine-threonine kinases with activating mutations
and in particular BRAFV600E. Besides, vemurafenib has
shown in vitro inhibitory activity on other kinases such as
CRAF, ARAF, wild-type BRAF, SRMS, ACK1, MAP4K5
and FGR[55-57]. Vemurafenib inhibits BRAFV600E with an
IC50 of 31 nM, 48 nM for CRAF, 100 nM for wild-type
BRAF. It inhibits SRMS with an IC50 of 18 nM, 19 nM
for ACK1, 51 nM for MAP4K5 and 63 nM for FGR [55].
Three studies represent the cornerstone in the
approval of vemurafenib by the FDA. These are BRIM1 (phase 1 trial), BRIM-2 (phase 2 trial) and most
importantly the BRIM-3 (phase 3 trial). In the BRIM-3
trial, vemurafenib was compared to dacarbazine in 675
patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma
BRAFV600E-mutated. In this study there were four deaths
(1%) in patients treated by vemurafenib not directly
attributed to disease progression, which occurred
35594

Oncotarget

within 28 days from the last dose administration of the
investigational drug. These deaths were linked to fatal
adverse events, which were cerebrovascular accident,
pneumonia, cardiopulmonary failure and aortic aneurysm
rupture. But, none of them were attributed to vemurafenib.
Grade 1-4 asthenia was recorded in 36 patients in
vemurafenib-arm (10.7%). The QT interval was examined
in a sub-study within BRIM-2, showing that for this drug
there is a concentration-dependent increase in QT interval
[54, 56, 57].
In the Expanded Access Program conducted in the
United States patients with metastatic melanoma were
treated with vemurafenib. Among these patients twentyfour (7%) had an increase in QTc interval of more than
480 milliseconds. Eleven patients (3%) had QTc intervals
of more than 500 milliseconds. Nineteen patients (5%) got
an increase in QTc interval from baseline by at least 60
milliseconds. But, it has to be noted that none of these QTc
interval prolongations was associated with any significant
clinical finding, such as arrhythmia. Two patients reported
a prolonged QT interval, which was a treatment-related
serious adverse event. Besides in two cases (0.5%) the
prolonged QT interval led to vemurafenib permanent
discontinuation [58].
Larkin et al. studied in an open-label, multicentre,
safety study, 3222 patients with BRAFV600 mutated
metastatic melanoma, who received at least one dose of
vemurafenib. Among these patients 316 (overall - 10%)
experienced prolonged QT interval with or without clinical
manifestation, such as atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia,
atrial flutter and other atrial arrhythmias, and ventricular
arrhythmias. Grade 1 and 2 QT prolongation was present
in 287 patients (9%), while 52 patients (2%) had corrected
(Fridericia) QT interval (QTcF) prolongation of more than
500 ms (grade 3 and 4). Peripheral edema was present in
215 patients (7%), including 212 with grade 1 and 2, while
5 had grade 3 and 4. Hypertension was also registered,
Grade 1 and 2 in 117 patients (4%), while grade 3 and 4 in
76 (2%) with an overall percentage by 6%. Four patients
died because of cerebrovascular accident and other four
patients died because of pulmonary embolism. The most
common adverse event leading to drug discontinuation
included QTc prolongation in nine patients (<1%).
Among these ones only two had QTcF longer than 500
ms, dyspnoea in six (<1%) and cerebral haemorrhage in
six (<1%) [59].
More recently Larkin et al. evaluated the efficacy
of the combination therapy with vemurafenib and
cobimetinib in comparison with vemurafenib plus placebo.
Among the 239 patients treated with vemurafenib plus
placebo grade 1 QT-interval prolongation was registered
in 8 patients (3%), grade 2 in 2 (1%), grade 3 in 3 (1%);
no grade 4 toxicity was registered. Low percentage
of frequency was also reported for decreased ejection
fraction, there was no grade 1 or 4 toxicity, grade 2 was
present in 4 patients (2%), while grade 3 was present in 3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(1%) [60].
Besides, some medical cases report cardiovascular
toxicity by vemurafenib. They report about not only QTinterval prolongation, but also about pericarditis and some
of them with effusion and tamponade [61, 62].

Dabrafenib
Dabrafenib is a potent and selective inhibitor
of some mutated forms of BRAF kinases. It has been
approved as a single agent or in combination with
trametinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable
or metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600E mutation (and
also metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600K mutation for
the combination therapy). It is not indicated for treatment
of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma. It inhibits in
vitro and in vivo BRAF mutated forms with an IC50 by 0.65
nM for BRAFV600E, 0.5 nM for BRAFV600K, 1.84 nM for
BRAFV600D. Less potently it inhibits CRAF with an IC50
of 5.0 nM and wild-type BRAF kinases with an IC50 of
3.2 nM and at greater concentrations other kinases such as
SIK1, NEK11, and LIMK1[63].
The clinical trials, which led to the approval of this
drug by the FDA are called BREAK. They are BREAK-1
(phase 1 trial), BREAK-2 (phase 2 trial), BREAK-3
(phase 3 trial) and BREAK-MB (phase 2 trial in BRAFmutant melanoma metastatic to the brain). No significant
cardiovascular toxicity was reported in these trials, in
which patients were treated with dabrafenib as a single
agent [64-67].
Cardiovascular adverse events were recorded
in patients which underwent the combination therapy
dabrafenib plus trametinib. These adverse events were
venous thromboembolism, decreased ejection fraction,
pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, hypertension
and hypotension, which were present in low percentages.
But, it is not possible to determine which one of the
two drugs is more cardiotoxic than the other one or
if it is the combination therapy itself that determines
cardiotoxicity[68-70].

Drugs in development
Many other molecules are still in development.
Most of them are so far studied in preclinical level, while
others have reached phase 1 trials. So, they still need more
data in order to establish if they determine cardiotoxicity
and eventually which level of expression. They include
RAF265, an orally bioavailable small molecule. It inhibits
the activities of several intracellular kinases such as
BRAFV600E, wild-type BRAF, CRAF, VEGFR2, PDGFR,
RET, c-KIT, SRC and other targets with an IC50 ranging
from less than 20 to more than 100 nM. It inhibits more
potently BRAFV600E and VEGFR2 than the other targets.
Among these molecules there are also PLX-8394, TAK35595

Oncotarget

632 (which is a potent and selective pan-RAF inhibitor
that overcomes paradoxical RAF activation), MLN-2480.
The molecule PLX-4720 was one of the first highly
selective inhibitors of mutant BRAFV600E (IC50 = 13 nM). It
was effective on cell lines in preclinical studies, but it did
not reach in vivo pharmacologic levels to affect efficiently
BRAFV600E [16, 71-77].
Finally, LGX818 a highly potent BRAF inhibitor has
been studied and developed for BRAF-mutated advanced
melanoma. It has a much longer half-life of dissociation
from BRAFV600E kinase than the other molecules. It
emerged from the studies that its toxicity profile was
similar to those of vemurafenib and dabrafenib. At
present, there is an ongoing trial. The COLUMBUS trial
is a randomized, open label, 3-arm phase 3 study which
compares the efficacy and safety of LGX818-MEK162
combination or LGX818 monotherapy to vemurafenib in
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with
BRAFV600 mutation (NCT01909453) [78].

highlighted a down-regulation of hERG channel protein
quantity and activity. Hence, it is possible to consider that
BRAF inhibitors down-regulating hERG channels protein
quantity and down-regulating their activity, undermine
IKr. This event determines a slowdown in repolarization,
which leads lastly to QT prolongation [79-84].
It remains to understand the mechanism by which
BRAF acts on hERG channels. Studies revealed that in
some cells cAMP stimulates MAPK activation in the
presence of BRAF and Rap1. In fact, cAMP activation
stimulated PKA, which in turn activated BRAF through
the small G protein Rap-1. The latter is a selective activator
of BRAF and inhibitor of Raf-1. Other studies disclosed
that increased concentration of cAMP determines effects
on hERG function through two pathways. Although
it increases hERG protein abundance and the channel
production, it decreases the trafficking velocity. On
one hand, cAMP stimulates PKA. The latter directly
phosphorylates hERG. PKA-dependent phosphorylation
of hERG gives the channels a minor ability to open
during action-potential voltages. So, there is an inhibition
of K+ current directed towards the outside of the cell at
all voltages. On the other hand, cAMP directly binds to
the hERG protein and shifts the voltage-dependence of
activation to depolarized potentials. Even though this
direct effect counterweights the PKA-dependent action,
the current inhibition and accelerated deactivation remain
unopposed. The final effect is a reduction of hERG
current. So, it could be possible to hypothesize that BRAF
inhibition through an inhibitory molecule determines a
compensatory up-regulation of cAMP. The increase in
cAMP concentration leads to the stimulation of PKA,
whose action stimulates the phosphorylation of hERG
channels. This event gives the channels a minor capability
to open and facilitate the repolarization of the cell. The
slowdown of the repolarization implies QT prolongation
[85-90] (Figure 1).

HYPOTHESES FOR ANTI-BRAF-RELATED
CARDIOTOXICITY
The human ether-a-go-go related-gene K+ channel
hERG is encoded by the KCNH2 gene. It is a voltageactivated K+ channel responding to changes in membrane
potential, widely expressed in the heart. It has a critical
role in the repolarization process of the action potential
in cardiomyocytes. In fact, these channels are responsible
of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr)
in the heart. The outward K+ currents and in particular the
delayed rectifier repolarizing current IK correlates with
repolarization. This determines the configuration of the
action potential. It results from the sum of two different
types of K+ currents: the rapid component, IKr, and the
slow component, IKs. These currents are fundamental in the
transition from phase 2 to phase 3 of the action potential
in cardiomyocytes. So, small changes in conductance can
significantly modify the effective refractory period, hence
the action potential duration. A reduction or an increase
in IKr lead respectively to long or short QT interval
converting in a QT syndrome. So, both of these conditions
render liable affected hearts to fatal arrhythmias (including
torsades de pointes, TdP) and sudden cardiac death.
The hERG channels could be also up-regulated by the
signalling of growth factors and contribute to it. Among
these factors there is BRAF, which may participate in the
regulation of these channels. Cardiac cells express all the
three RAF family members, RAF-1, BRAF, and ARAF.
They stimulate survival and growth of cardiomyocytes. A
recent study has shown that BRAF is a powerful regulator
of hERG K+ channels, stimulating them. Wild-type BRAF
increased hERG channel protein abundance in the cell
membrane and consequently it increased the hERGmediated current through the cell membrane. Furthermore,

CONCLUSIONS
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has a central
role in many cellular processes. It transmits a mitogenic
signal and stimulates cell proliferation, gene expression
and survival. The molecules involved in this pathway have
been investigated for many years either in their wild-type
or mutated form. The evidence of BRAF mutated forms
(above all BRAFV600E) in melanoma, papillary thyroid
cancer and colorectal cancer have pushed the researchers
to focus on this target. Over time various molecules
have been developed, first as multi-target agents but
progressively the aim has become to produce drugs that
could selectively target BRAF and particularly its mutated
forms. These selective molecules for BRAF mutated
forms have shown to impair QT interval throughout their
development. For this reason a precaution for the use of
BRAF inhibitors in patients with pre-existing conditions

affecting their QT interval on ECG has been inserted in
their label.
In this work we analyze the cardiotoxicity data
related to molecules that target either as multi-target or
selective agents (Table 2). The data analysis shows that
multi-target molecules have somewhat an influence
on QT interval, even though clinically not significant.
Vemurafenib, as a selective agent, has a more consistent
influence on QT interval leading to clinically significant
changes. Conversely the recently approved BRAF
inhibitor dabrafenib seems to have a slight cardiotoxic
effect when used in combination with trametinib. Such
heterogeneity of data can be a consequence of the different
power by which each molecule hits its target in vivo
compared to that one disclosed in vitro.
Herein we propose a mechanism through which
BRAF inhibitors may determine their cardiotoxic effect.
Indeed we hypothesize that BRAF inhibitors blocking
this molecule lead to an increase in cAMP activity and
through PKA, this event increases hERG channels
phosphorylation. These channels normally facilitate
K+ ions transit, which correlates with myocardial
repolarization process. Phosphorylation decreases the
function of these channels. Certainly many molecules
could intervene in this mechanism. Some data about the
association of Raf-1 with cardiovascular adverse events
are reported in literature [91, 92].
Although the cardiac effects of BRAF inhibitors
in clinical trials are reported in low percentage, attention
must be paid on the use of these drugs, because an
uncontrolled QT prolongation could expose to a syndrome
that would lead to fatal arrhythmias and sudden cardiac
death.
Therefore a cooperation between Oncologists and
Cardiologists is very important when these drugs are
delivered. While Oncologists should pay attention to
the potential onset of these effects, Cardiologists should
promptly and appropriately treat as necessary the side
effects that occur. The rising integrated discipline called
Cardio-Oncology should focus on research about BRAF
inhibitors, either developing experimental models on
cardiotoxicity and planning prospective studies focused
on the cardiac effects of these drugs.
