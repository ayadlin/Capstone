Abstract
Hypoxia, a common feature of the microenvironment in solid tumors, is associated with resistance to
radiotherapy, reduced therapeutic response, and a poorer clinical outcome. In head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC), the negative effect of hypoxia on radiotherapy can be counteracted via addition of hypoxic
modification to the radiotherapy. To predict which patients harbor hypoxic tumors and would therefore benefit
from hypoxic modification, clinically applicable methods for pretherapeutic hypoxic evaluation and categorization are needed. In this study, we developed a hypoxia classifier based on gene expression. Through study of
xenograft tumors from human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, we verified the in vivo relevance of previously
identified in vitro derived hypoxia-induced genes. We then evaluated a training set of 58 hypoxia-evaluated
HNSCCs to generate a gene expression classifier containing 15 genes. This 15-gene hypoxia classifier was
validated in 323 patients with HNSCC randomized for hypoxic modification or placebo in combination with
radiotherapy. Tumors categorized as hypoxic on the basis of the classifier were associated with a significantly
poorer clinical outcome than nonhypoxic tumors. This outcome was improved and equalized to the nonhypoxic
tumors by addition of hypoxic modification. Thus, findings show that the classifier attained both prognostic and
predictive impact, and its pretherapeutic use may provide a method to identify those patients who will benefit
from hypoxic modification of radiotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5923–31. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The specific issue of hypoxia-induced radiation resistance
has been acknowledged for more than 100 years and methods
to describe and overcome the obstacle have occupied
researchers in the field of radiotherapy ever since (1–3).
Therapeutic initiatives such as hyperbaric oxygen (4), hypoxic
radiosensitizers (5, 6), and hypoxic cytotoxins (7) to control
tumor hypoxia have been promising, but the question still
remains whether we are evaluating and directing the hypoxiatargeted therapy to the right patients.
Techniques to detect relevant tumor hypoxia have continuously evolved and the approaches have included both
direct measurements in the tumor by an oxygen electrode (8,
9), infusion and detection of exogenous hypoxia tracers

[pimonidazole (10) and various PET-tracers (11–16)], or quantification of endogenous hypoxia markers expressed by the
tumor cells under hypoxic conditions (17–19). Despite progression in these fields, no common treatment strategy and
identification approach about hypoxia in tumors has yet been
implemented in a clinical setting.
In this study, we aimed at generating a method for characterizing the hypoxic status of a tumor based on quantifying
the gene expressions of hypoxia-responsive and hypoxia-specific genes within the tumor biopsy, and furthermore generate
a method that could improve the ability of individualizing
treatment in accordance to such characterization. Thus, the
experimental plan involved identifying specific hypoxiainduced genes responding with a significant increase in
expression correlating to a radiobiological relevant oxygen
level (20) that could additionally identify patients having
benefit from hypoxic modification of radiotherapy. Such
"hypoxia-regulated genes" have previously been suggested in
the literature (21–23), but to our knowledge none of the
developed hypoxia gene expression signatures (24–26) have
yet shown to be predictive for beneficial treatment strategies
and consequently implemented in the clinic.
To identify relevant genes for hypoxia classification, we have
previously focused especially on the influence of hypoxia and
pH on gene expression in vitro (27). From these studies, 29
genes characterized by being upregulated under hypoxic conditions and furthermore being independent of pH fluctuations

were identified as potential classifier genes across a range of
human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. The identified
genes were upregulated more than 2-fold under hypoxia in
at least 4 of 5 cell lines. In addition, we chose to investigate and
quantify the gene CA9, which has frequently been associated to
hypoxia in the literature (refs. 28–30; Table 1).
We first validated the in vivo relevance of the in vitro
identified genes in a xenograft study by applying the hypoxia
radiotracer 18F-flouroazomycin arabinoside (FAZA) in the
detection and isolation of hypoxic and nonhypoxic tumor
tissue. Following gene expression quantification, we compared the genetic response in the 2 areas to detect whether
an upregulation in the hypoxic area could be registered. To
proceed into the clinical setting, we then developed a hypoxia
classifier on gene expressions quantified from hypoxia-eval-

uated human tumor biopsies. This classifier contained 15 of
the in vitro identified hypoxia-responsive genes that could best
discriminate between "more" and "less" hypoxic human head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC; evaluated by
oxygen electrode measurements). In an independent data set,
where patients were randomized for either placebo or hypoxic
modification in combination with radiotherapy, we finally
evaluated whether the developed 15-gene hypoxia classifier
could identify patients with hypoxic tumors and thereby
identify patients that would potentially benefit from hypoxic
modification. Our findings indicate that with this strategy, it
has been possible to develop a 15-gene hypoxia classifier,
which attain both prognostic and predictive impact.

Materials and Methods
Biological material
In vitro experiments were based on human squamous cell
carcinoma cell lines UTSCC5, UTSCC14, UTSCC15 [oral carcinoma, unknown human papilloma virus (HPV) status, established by Dr. Reidar Grenman, University of Turku, Finland,
obtained from Dr. Michael Baumann], FADUDD (a subline of
FaDu, an undifferentiated hypopharyngeal carcinoma, HPVnegative, obtained from Dr. Michael Baumann), and SiHa
(uterine cervix carcinoma, HPV-positive, obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection). Xenograft tumors for in
vivo validation were generated with cell lines of UTSCC33 (oral
carcinoma, unknown HPV status, established by Dr. Reidar
Grenman, University of Turku, Finland, obtained from Dr.
Michael Baumann), FADUDD, and SiHa. None of the cell lines
have been tested and authenticated. The hypoxia classifier was
generated from 58 head and neck cancer biopsies archived as
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples (FFPE). The
oxygen status of these tumors had previously been evaluated in
accordance to the relative number of oxygen electrode measurements less than 2.5 mm Hg in their metastatic lymph nodes
(9, 31, 32). To test the prognostic and predictive impact of the
developed classifier, we isolated mRNA from 326 accessible
archival supraglottic larynx or pharynx tumor samples (FFPE)
from the randomized, double-blinded DAHANCA 5 trial (6).
Gene expression could be quantified in 323 samples, and these
were individually classified as either "more" or "less" hypoxic. In
the original study, 414 tumors had been randomized to either
placebo or hypoxic modification with nimorazole [4-[2-(5nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl]morpholine] in conjunction with
conventional radiotherapy (62–68 Gy, 2 Gy/fx, 5 fx/wk). Those
treated with nimorazole experienced an improved outcome in
comparison with those treated with placebo. There was no
significant differences in terms of patient and tumor characteristics (N- and T-stage, tumor site, tumor differentiation, age,
gender, HPV status) and locoregional tumor failure between
the 91 patients where RNA was not accessible and the 323
patients included in the present analysis (data not shown).
Identifying hypoxia-responsive pH-independent genes
The subjected genes were selected from the data from a
previously published in vitro study, where the above-mentioned
cell lines were exposed to different oxygen concentrations

and pH levels (7.5 or 6.3; ref. 27). Gene expression was analyzed
with microarray (Affymetrix–Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0
Array). In addition, the expression of the pH-dependent gene
CA9 was evaluated. (Fig. 1A).

Gene expression quantification
RNA from fresh-frozen tissue was extracted by using
RNeasy-kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA from FFPE tumor biopsies was extracted by using a
fully automated, bead-based RNA isolation procedure (34).
cDNA was generated by using the High Capacity cDNA
Archive kit (Applied Biosystems; ABI) and gene expression
was quantified by using qPCR. cDNA based on FFPE samples
was preamplified according to the manufacturer's details
(TaqMan PreAmp, ABI) before real time qPCR. To detect
transcripts of interest, TaqMan Gene Expression assay
(ABI) was used for all potential classifier and reference genes

Hypoxia tracer and isolation of hypoxic xenograft tissue
In autoradiographic studies of xenograft tumors, FAZA was
used as exogenous tracer revealing hypoxic tumor areas (<10
mm Hg; ref. 33). Immediately after cryosection of the excised
tumor, autoradiography was carried out. This procedure was
carried out at 20 C to minimize degradation of mRNA. By
demarcating FAZA-positive areas (H) and FAZA-negative
areas (N) from the autoradiography a computer-assisted
(ImageGauge) 1:1 template was made to describe the hypoxic
status inside the tumor. Guided by hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining of every fifth section (Fig. 1B), necrotic areas
were avoided if possible and the demarcated areas were
dissected. Tissue from multiple corresponding sections, but

representing each area, was pooled to achieve tissue for
quantitative PCR (qPCR) quantification. Every fifth tumor
section was left in total (M) before RNA extraction, cDNA
preparation, and qPCR. All sections were preserved in RNAlater-ICE at 80 C prior to dissection.

(Supplementary Table S1). Reactions were carried out on an
ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detector (ABI) and in duplicate.
Seven potential reference genes were analyzed: ACTR3,
CHCHD1, NDFIP1, SPCS2, and TMEM85 were selected on
the basis of our previous in vitro results (27); RPL37A and
TFRC have previously been described (35, 36). The geNORM
application available in RealTime Statminer (Intergromics)
was used on the training set of 58 HNSCC samples, and 3
optimal reference genes (RPL37A, ACTR3, and NDFIP1) were
selected for normalization. Data were analyzed by using RealTime Statminer (Intergromics) and DCt values were generated
by normalizing to the geometric mean of the 3 reference genes.
When analyzing FFPE samples, Ct values more than 35 or with
an SD more than 0.3 were dismissed and interpreted as empty
wells. Gene expression levels were quantified as 2DCt and log2transformed before building the classifier.

was quantified from each area, respectively. A Wilcoxon's
signed rank analysis of the intratumor variability of gene
expression measured with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR showed that all the suggested genes were
significantly upregulated in hypoxic tumor areas (H) compared with nonhypoxic tumor areas (N; Fig. 1D). To mimic the
clinical scenario where biopsies may include both well-oxygenated and hypoxic areas, we also compared the gene expression from nonhypoxic tumor areas with the gene expression in
total neighbor sections (M) that represented more heterogeneous tissue material. With this, we expected to verify whether
the hypoxia-induced upregulation would be traceable in terms
of gene expression, irrespective of being quantified from a mix
of both hypoxic and nonhypoxic tumor areas. We found all but
3 genes to be significantly upregulated (Fig. 1E), which supported their potential role as hypoxic markers.

Statistical analyses
Gene expression in the H, N, and M areas of the xenograft
tumors were compared with Wilcoxon's signed rank analysis.
The prognostic impact of the 15-gene hypoxia classifier was
evaluated on the placebo group of the DAHANCA 5 data set.
This subgroup had been treated with radiotherapy alone (6).
The predictive impact for hypoxic modification with nimorazole in conjunction with radiotherapy was evaluated by
comparing the response to placebo or nimorazole among
the groups classified as having "more" or "less" hypoxic
tumors, respectively. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard
analysis was used to evaluate the importance of independent
tumor characteristics and treatment, with respect to the risk
of locoregional failure. All patients were observed for at least 5
years or until death. Follow-up was completed as part of the
original study. End point in the evaluation of the classifier was
cumulative incidence of locoregional tumor failure defined as
persistence or recurrence of the disease in the primary tumor
(T site) or regional lymph nodes (N site) after radiotherapy
and compared at 5 years. Death within 3 years after finalized
treatment and without failure was considered a competing
risk in the analysis (37). Statistical analyses were carried out
with STATA 10 software. All P values are 2-sided with a level of
significance at 5%.

Generation of a hypoxia classifier with prognostic
impact included 15 hypoxia-responsive genes
Identification of the most informative genes for relevant
hypoxia classification in human biopsies was carried out by
quantifying gene expression in 58 head and neck cancer
biopsies that had previously been hypoxia evaluated and
ranked in accordance to oxygen electrode measurements in
their metastatic neck nodes (9, 31, 32). In the effort of building
the hypoxia classifier we separated and categorized the 58
tumors constituting the training set into a "more" hypoxic
group containing the 10 tumors with the highest frequency of
low oxygen electrode measurements and a "less" hypoxic
group containing the remaining 48 tumors (Fig. 2A). With
this split of the hypoxia-ranked tumors, we obtained 2 groups
with the largest possible distance between mean gene expression levels among the groups and thereby the greatest discrimination in terms of gene expression. In short, the
separation of the tumors into these 2 groups was determined
by the ratio of between to within variations (B/W) in expression levels (see Supplementary Data on classification). We
obtained the highest B/W ratios when the "more" hypoxic
group consisted of the 10 most hypoxic tumors (Fig. 2B).
Subsequently, an independent tumor would be classified as
belonging to the predefined group ("more" or "less" hypoxic),
where the distance from the gene expression level of the
independent tumor and to the mean gene expression level
of the predefined group was lowest (Supplementary Data on
classification; Supplementary Table S2).
We then determined the number of genes to constitute the
most optimal classifier. By use of a "leave one out" crossvalidation approach (38), each sample from the training set
was classified, one by one, as belonging to either of the 2 groups.
The classification was based on all samples from the training
set, excluding the sample being classified. Each of the 58
samples was then classified with combinations of the 30, 29,
28, and so on best separating genes. We found that a combination of 15 genes was optimal to classify the highest number of
tumors into the same group as they were predefined into
(Fig. 2C). As the final classifier, we chose the 15 candidate
genes (Table 1) that were present with the highest frequency in
the 58 "leave one out" classifications with a 15-gene classifier

Results
Suggested in vitro derived hypoxia-responsive genes are
upregulated in hypoxic areas of in vivo xenograft
tumors
To confirm the in vivo hypoxia specificity of the 30 genes,
subcutaneous xenograft tumors in nude mice were established from 3 cell lines of human squamous cell carcinoma, of
which 2 were used in the in vitro experiments. Before excision
of the evolved tumor, mice were administered with the
hypoxia tracer FAZA (33) which allowed ex vivo visualization
of hypoxic tumor areas by autoradiography. A computerassisted 1:1 template of demarcated FAZA-positive and
FAZA-negative areas was generated from the autoradiography
to guide the dissection of hypoxic and nonhypoxic tumor
tissue (Fig. 1B and C). Tissue was isolated and gene expression

terms of cumulative incidence of locoregional tumor failure
(46% vs. 54%, P ¼ 0.28), irrespective of whether the patient had
been treated with nimorazole or placebo in conjunction with
the radiotherapy. This indicated a beneficial effect of additive
treatment with nimorazole that was restricted to those
tumors classified as "more" hypoxic. A Cox proportional
hazards analysis for risk of locoregional failure was carried
out. The following parameters were included in the model:
15-gene classification ("more" vs. "less" hypoxic), nodal status
(N-positive vs. N-negative), tumor stage (T3-4 vs. T1-2),
hypoxic modification (nimorazole vs. placebo), HPV status
(p16-positive vs. p16-negative), gender (male vs. female), and
age (<60 vs. 60). The 15-gene classifier was found to have
independent prognostic importance with an HR of 1.41 (95%
CI, 1.03–1.94). A test for interaction showed that the response
to nimorazole was significantly different in the "more" hypoxic
tumors compared with the response in the "less" hypoxic
tumors (P ¼ 0.003). In a separate multivariate analysis,
nimorazole was an independent factor associated with good
prognosis in "more" hypoxic tumors (HR ¼ 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25–
0.68), whereas there was no significant effect of hypoxic
modification with nimorazole in "less" hypoxic tumors (HR
¼ 0.98; 95% CI, 0.67–1.44).

Discussion
In principle, there are at least 3 different methods to
measure hypoxic status of a tumor: the physical approach,
with an oxygen sensing electrode inserted into the tumor
(39); a metabolic approach with preinjection and visualization of metabolically bound exogenous hypoxia tracers (10,
14, 33); or the more biology-driven approach characterized
by the measurement of one or more endogenous genes being
expressed under hypoxic conditions in the tumor (17, 28).
Despite negative influence of hypoxia on the outcome of
HNSCC after radiotherapy and despite evidence that modification of hypoxia can benefit the patients with hypoxic
tumors (3, 6), such methods for pretheraputic hypoxic tumor
evaluation have not yet been implemented in the clinical
setting. This is probably due to an understandable combination of disadvantages either in the form of physical inconveniencies, need for preinjection of tracer, or a lack of
sensitivity or specificity of the hypoxia markers (17). In this
project we tried to apply the advantages of 2 of these
previously established methods to measure hypoxia to refine
and improve the third approach into a more clinically
relevant and applicable form. Thus, we developed a hypoxia
gene expression classifier enabling us to characterize an
independent tumor as either "more" or "less" hypoxic, based
on the quantification of hypoxia-responsive genes in the
tumor biopsy.
The initially suggested potential classifier genes were characterized by being upregulated under hypoxic conditions and
furthermore independent of pH fluctuations in the previous in
vitro studies (27). The pH parameter was included as studies
have shown that hypoxia-induced genes can also be regulated
by other factors such as inflammation and pH fluctuations (17,
36, 40). Therefore, independency to one or more of these

Hypoxia Gene Expression Classifier

factors could hypothetically improve the hypoxia specificity of
the gene in question. To improve the clinical applicability and
the choice of potentially predictive genes contained in a
hypoxia-specific signature/classifier, we aimed at identifying
hypoxia-induced and pH-independent genes. In addition to
the pH-independent genes, we also chose to evaluate the pHdependent gene CA9 due to its frequent linkage to hypoxia in
the literature (41–43).
At first, we verified that the genes being upregulated under
hypoxic in vitro conditions were also upregulated in hypoxic
areas of in vivo xenograft tumors (Fig. 1D). Furthermore the
hypoxia-induced gene expression could also be measured
from total xenograft sections which resembled tumor biopsies
(Fig. 1E). We therefore believe that these genes can be used as
indicators of clinically relevant hypoxia. We also registered
that although 27 of the genes were significantly upregulated in
the total sections compared with the nonhypoxic tumor
tissue, the magnitude of upregulation varied considerably.
Thus, a fraction of the suggested genes probably carried more
hypoxia-specific information than all of the genes together. In
a recent study by Marotta and colleagues (22), a comparable
xenograft approach was applied in the description of in vitro
versus in vivo hypoxia-responsive genes in a single gliosarcoma model. Few genes were common to the 2 growth
conditions, and in general they found striking differences
between the global in vitro and in vivo hypoxic mRNA profiles.
In contrast to Marotta and colleagues, we did not aim at
identifying a new set of in vivo generated hypoxia-responsive
genes through an explorative supervised cDNA microarray
analysis in a xenograft study, but used it as an in vivo
verification of the hypoxia-induced upregulation already
observed in the previous in vitro studies. Furthermore, the
genes from our in vitro studies were selected on the basis of
several different cell lines, and this probably explains why we
in general observe a good correlation between our in vitro and
in vivo settings. Interestingly, 13 of the 30 suggested hypoxiaresponsive genes included in our study were also identified
either in the in vitro or the in vivo studies from the Marotta and
colleagues. This supports the idea that common hypoxiainduced genes can be used to evaluate hypoxia in different
tumor sites (26).
In contrast to previous studies on hypoxia gene expression
classifiers, we wanted to build a classifier based on the hypoxic
status of the tumors. We therefore developed the final 15-gene
classifier in a training set of 58 HNSCC tumors that were
evaluated and ranked according to the number of low oxygenelectrode measurements of their metastatic neck nodes (31,
32, 44). We also wished to develop a robust classifier that can
be used routinely to classify individual FFPE tumor biopsies.
Compared with the previously published hypoxia signatures
(22, 24–26) we identified some genes that are in common. In
the most comprehensive study, Buffa and colleagues used a
network-based approach involving both coexpression networks and gene set enrichment analysis to identify a gene
expression signature that correlates with prognosis across
different tumor sites (26). That there is some overlap between
the genes identified by these very different approaches supports the use of gene expression as a global marker for

hypoxia. However, because of the difference between the
approaches, we would also expect to find genes that are
not in common. First, we did not develop the classifier on
the basis of its prognostic value, but solely on the association
with hypoxic status in the tumor. Second, some of the coexpression networks in the network-based approach include
CA9 (25, 26). Although CA9 failed in our in vitro analysis which
generally excluded pH-dependent genes, we chose to include it
in the analysis. In the xenograft study, CA9 was indeed
upregulated in hypoxic areas consistent with the findings
by Marotta and colleagues (22). However, CA9 was not correlated to the hypoxic status of the tumors in the training set,
and is not among the genes in the final 15-gene classifier.
Finally, we have specifically focused on test genes and reference genes that can be measured robustly in FFPE samples
and where gene expression measurements in an unknown
sample can be used directly to classify the tumor in a clinical
setting. Although the samples in the validation set were 20 to
24 years old, we could successfully classify 323 of 326 tumors.
Whether these exact classification levels can be directly
applied to tumors of other cellular origin still remains to
be examined.
The relevance of the classification levels in HNSCC was
tested when classifying the 323 patients from the DAHANCA 5
trial as either "more" or "less" hypoxic. This validation set was
unique as both prognostic and predictive evaluation was
possible. We verified the prognostic relevance of the classifier
by focusing on the outcome of the classified tumors in the
placebo group. These tumors were treated with radiotherapy
alone. We observed a significantly poorer outcome of those
tumors classified as "more" hypoxic, when compared with the
"less" hypoxic tumors (Fig. 2E). We believe this difference can
be explained by a more pronounced resistance to radiotherapy
in the "more" hypoxic tumors, thus a less efficient treatment
response.
By including those randomized for hypoxic modification in
the analysis, we also showed the predictive impact of the
classifier. Those tumors classified as "more" hypoxic
responded significantly better to the radiosensitizer nimorazole than compared with those classified as "less" hypoxic
(Fig. 3A and B). This was confirmed in a multivariate analysis.
Thus, we conclude that when quantifying the expression of
hypoxia-induced genes in the tumor biopsy, the classifier
identifies a subgroup of candidate HNSCC patients for hypoxic
modification of radiotherapy. Therefore, the 15-gene hypoxia
classifier attains both prognostic and predictive potential and
suggests that hypoxic modification of radiotherapy should
only be tailored to a subgroup of patients with gene expression
classified "more" hypoxic tumors.
