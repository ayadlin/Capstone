Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent with established antitumor activity in patients with primary brain tumors
and melanoma. The originally approved temozolomide dosing regimen is 150 to 200 mg/m2 per day (Days 1 to 5
every 28-day cycle [5 of 28 days]). However, extended dosing regimens (eg, 7 of 14 days, 21 of 28 days, 6 of 8 weeks,
or continuously daily) allow for administration of a higher cumulative dose per cycle and have been shown to deplete
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, which may enhance cytotoxic activity. This article reviews efficacy and
safety data from studies that investigated dose-dense temozolomide regimens in patients with recurrent glioma and
advanced metastatic melanoma. The clinical benefits of these dose-dense regimens compared with the standard 5 of
28-day regimen have yet to be established. Although the toxicity profile of dose-dense temozolomide is generally
similar to that of the standard 5 of 28-day regimen, it is associated with an increased incidence and severity of
lymphocytopenia. The clinical management of temozolomide-associated lymphodepletion and the potential risks and
benefits of extended dosing with temozolomide are discussed. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that
temozolomide-associated lymphodepletion may enhance the host immune response to tumor-associated antigens
and/or immunotherapy and may overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression. Further studies exploring the

Temozolomide is a second-generation, orally administered, DNA alkylating agent with excellent bioavailability
in the central nervous system. Phase 2 studies in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma and advanced metastatic melanoma established 150 to 200 mg/m2 per day on Days 1 to 5 of each 28-day cycle (5 of 28 days) as a clinically active and
generally well-tolerated regimen.1-6 This regimen has been used widely for the treatment of patients with recurrent highgrade glioma and advanced metastatic melanoma since the late 1990s. The major dose-limiting toxicity of the standard
dosing regimen is myelosuppression, mainly grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia with an incidence of 7% to 17% across all studies, and neutropenia to a lesser extent.2,5,7,8 Unlike nitrosoureas, treatment with temozolomide is not associated with cumulative hematologic toxicity, and the occurrence of severe myelosuppression prohibiting the continuation of
temozolomide treatment is rare.
Rationale for Alternate Regimens
The cytotoxic effect of temozolomide is mediated primarily via methylation at the O6 position of guanine, and the predominant mechanism of tumor resistance to temozolomide is overexpression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT).9 Evidence supporting the role of MGMT in determining response to temozolomide comes from clinical
studies demonstrating that epigenetic inactivation of MGMT by hypermethylation of the promoter is associated with
improved tumor response and survival in patients with glioblastoma.10-12 Other studies have extended this observation to
include patients with anaplastic glioma and anaplastic (oligo)astrocytoma.13,14
Although MGMT can effectively repair temozolomide-mediated DNA damage, the enzyme is consumed in the
process.15 This led to exploration of extended dose-dense temozolomide regimens, with the idea that they could
potentially deplete MGMT in tumor cells by overwhelming the cells’ ability to synthesize MGMT, which might enhance

therapeutic activity. The concept of MGMT depletion
was validated by Tolcher et al,16 who showed that
MGMT enzyme activity was depleted in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during treatment with temozolomide for either 7 consecutive days every 14 days (7 of
14-day regimen) or 21 consecutive days every 28 days
(21 of 28-day regimen). The hypothesis that these dosing
schedules that deplete MGMT could result in improved
antitumor activity presupposes that MGMT depletion in
tumor cells is similar to that observed in PBMCs. However, the extent of MGMT depletion in tumor cells has
not been directly demonstrated and might not parallel the
effect observed in PBMCs. Therefore, it remains unclear
whether dose-dense temozolomide regimens can deplete
MGMT in tumors and overcome MGMT-mediated
resistance.
In addition, other mechanisms may further contribute to the antitumor activity of extended temozolomide
dosing schedules. First, a growing body of evidence suggests that daily temozolomide may act as a radiosensitizer
when coadministered with radiotherapy.17-19 Second,
protracted, low-dose, daily chemotherapy, also referred to
as metronomic chemotherapy,20 may exert antiangiogenic
effects via induction of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors,21,22 apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial
cells,23 and/or decreased mobilization and viability of circulating endothelial progenitor cells.24
Dose-Dense Temozolomide Regimens
Initial attempts to modify the standard temozolomide
dosing regimen examined the safety of continuous daily
administration for up to 7 weeks. In a preliminary phase
1 study, temozolomide administered continuously for
6 or 7 weeks at a dose of 75 mg/m2/d to patients with
malignant glioma was well tolerated.25 The demonstration that continuous daily dosing with temozolomide was
feasible paved the way for combining it with fractionated
radiation therapy (RT) in patients with newly diagnosed
glioblastoma. After promising survival data emerged from
a phase 2 study of RT combined with concomitant temozolomide (75 mg/m2/d) followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant
temozolomide (at the standard dose of 150-200 mg/m2/d
on the 5 of 28-day schedule),26 a randomized phase 3 trial
(European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer [EORTC] 26,981-22,981/CE.3) established this
regimen as the new standard of care for initial treatment
of glioblastoma.27 This landmark trial demonstrated
improved overall survival (OS) in patients treated with

and combination therapy did not adversely affect quality
of life.28,29
Recurrent high-grade glioma (World Health
Organization grade III and IV)

Given that many patients with high-grade glioma
receive temozolomide as part of their initial treatment and
typically experience disease progression during or within a
few months after completing first-line therapy, standarddose temozolomide is not a viable option at recurrence.
Therefore, several alternative dose-dense temozolomide
regimens have been explored in patients with recurrent
high-grade glioma. The most widely studied regimens in
this setting include a continuous daily schedule at a dose
of 50 mg/m2/d,30,31 the 7 of 14-day schedule at a dose of
150 mg/m2/d (also referred to as the ‘‘1 week on/1 week
off’’ schedule),32 and the 21 of 28-day schedule at a dose
of 75 to 100 mg/m2/d.16,25 These dosing regimens
increase the cumulative dose of temozolomide over a 28day cycle by approximately 2-fold compared with the
standard 5 of 28-day schedule.2,5,6,30,32-38 Dose-dense
temozolomide regimens have been investigated in patients
with recurrent high-grade glioma, with reported 6-month
progression-free survival (PFS) rates ranging 30% to 44%
in patients with glioblastoma and 56% in patients with
anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (Table 1).30,32,34-37 Studies
investigating the activity of these regimens for the treatment of glioma have been reviewed recently.39 The results
of these various uncontrolled studies suggest that retreatment with a dose-dense regimen has activity in some glioblastoma patients who experience disease progression
during or shortly after completing adjuvant treatment
with the 5 of 28-day regimen (after initial therapy with
RT plus concomitant temozolomide), thus lending support to the notion that dose-dense temozolomide regimens may, to some extent, overcome resistance that
develops during standard-dose adjuvant temozolomide
therapy.
Low-grade gliomas (World Health Organization
grade II)

Protracted low-dose chemotherapy has been suggested as an alternative to RT to reduce the risk of radiation encephalopathy and cognitive deficits in patients
with low-grade gliomas (LGGs) that recur or progress after surgery. The standard 5 of 28-day temozolomide regimen is clinically active in LGGs, with 1-year PFS rates in
chemo- and RT-naive patients ranging from 73% to

In the context of low-grade tumors, which have a
limited number of cells in the proliferation phase at any
given time, chronic exposure to lower doses of cytotoxic
drugs may be a more effective therapeutic strategy than
achieving high peak drug levels. Thus, in low-grade
tumors, extended low-dose temozolomide regimens
might provide additional benefit compared with the
standard 5 of 28-day regimen. A limited number of nonrandomized studies have evaluated the efficacy of protracted temozolomide schedules in patients with LGG
(Table 1).42-44 Two studies evaluating the 21 of 28-day
regimen reported 1-year PFS rates of 72% and 73%.42,44
However, the incidence of grade III lymphopenia ranged
from 20% to 48%. Another study evaluating the 7 of 14day regimen in patients with oligodendroglioma or mixed
oligoastrocytoma reported an objective response rate of
32%, and 80% of patients were progression-free at a median follow-up of 14 months.43 Again, the incidence of
grade III lymphopenia was high (45%), and 15% of
patients required dose interruption or transfer to the
standard temozolomide regimen (5 of 28 days). On the
basis of the small number of studies and the heterogeneity
of the patient populations, it is difficult to assess differences in the clinical benefit of dose-dense regimens com-

2870

pared with the standard 5 of 28-day regimen. However, it
is clear that dose-dense regimens are associated with
increased myelotoxicity, especially chronic lymphopenia.
Prospective randomized studies comparing these regimens
are warranted to determine whether dose-dense temozolomide regimens can improve clinical outcomes in this setting. The potential benefit of temozolomide as an
alternative to RT is currently being evaluated in an
ongoing EORTC randomized phase 3 trial comparing
temozolomide (75 mg/m2/d; 21 of 28-day schedule) for a
maximum of 12 cycles with RT as primary treatment.
Melanoma

Several phase 2 and phase 3 trials have also evaluated
the clinical benefit of temozolomide monotherapy in
patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma. Whereas
initial trials used the standard 5 of 28-day dosing regimen,3,45-49 more recent studies have evaluated dose-dense
regimens, most commonly 75 mg/m2/d for 6 or 7 weeks
followed by a 2- to 4-week break.50,51 Response rates
reported in these studies ranged from 10% to 13%, and
median OS ranged from 6 to 10 months. In general, both
standard and dose-dense temozolomide monotherapy
have demonstrated modest activity (response rates <20%
and median survival times <8 months) in advanced melanoma. Most recently, the EORTC 18,032 phase 3 trial

Cancer

demonstrated similar benefit associated with the 7 of 14day temozolomide regimen (150 mg/m2/d) compared
with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 every 21 days) in patients
with advanced melanoma.52 Thus, the antitumor activity
of single-agent temozolomide appears to be similar to single-agent dacarbazine, regardless of the dosing schedule. A
large number of phase 2 studies have also investigated the
combination of temozolomide with interferon-a (IFN-a)
or thalidomide in patients with advanced melanoma and
have reported promising activity, particularly when dosedense temozolomide regimens were used (reviewed by
Hwu et al53).
Association of MGMT with therapeutic efficacy
of dose-dense temozolomide

A retrospective subset analysis of MGMT promoter
methylation status in glioblastoma patients enrolled in the
randomized phase 3 National Cancer Institute of Canada
(NCIC)–EORTC 26,981-22,981/CE.3 trial suggested
that the survival benefit associated with temozolomide
was primarily restricted to patients with methylated
MGMT promoter sequences in their tumor tissue; 93
(45%) of 206 assessable cases were methylated.11 Within
this subset, RT plus temozolomide significantly improved
OS compared with RT alone (21.7 months vs 15.3
months, respectively; P ¼ .007). In contrast, there was a
negligible survival benefit among patients whose tumors
had unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences.
Unfortunately, based on the available data, it is not
yet clear whether dose-dense temozolomide regimens can
overcome MGMT-mediated resistance or improve clinical outcome compared with the standard 5 of 28-day regimen. The only study that prospectively compared the
standard 5 of 28-day regimen with a dose-dense regimen
is the British MRC-B12 trial.54 This trial randomized
447 patients with recurrent malignant glioma to treatment with standard temozolomide (5 of 28-day), dosedense temozolomide (21 of 28-day), or procarbazine,
1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy. Median survival was
8.5 months with the 5 of 28-day regimen, 6.5 months
with the 21 of 28-day regimen, and 6.7 months with
PCV.54 Several studies have examined whether dosedense regimens can improve survival in patients with an
unmethylated MGMT promoter. In the single-arm UKT05 trial,55 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
(n ¼ 41) received sequential treatment with 2 cycles of
neoadjuvant temozolomide (150 mg/m2, 7 of 14-day regimen), standard RT with concomitant temozolomide,

Cancer

and adjuvant therapy with the 7 of 14-day regimen for
16 weeks. In addition, patients received 25 mg of the
radiosensitizing agent indomethacin (twice daily)
throughout the treatment period. The authors concluded
that the clinical outcome in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter (median OS, 15.9þ months;
median PFS, 7.6 months) was similar to that observed in
the overall patient population in the NCIC-EORTC trial
treated with the standard 5 of 28-day regimen in the adjuvant setting,27 which compares favorably with the outcomes for patients with an unmethylated MGMT
promoter in that trial.56
The correlation between MGMT promoter methylation status and the antitumor activity of dose-dense
temozolomide regimens has also been assessed in 2 prospective phase 2 trials and 1 retrospective study in patients
with recurrent glioma.13,32,34 In these studies, patients
whose tumors had a methylated MGMT promoter at initial diagnosis had numerically improved survival rates
compared with patients whose tumors had an unmethylated promoter; however, these differences, within a relatively small series of patients, did not achieve statistical
significance. In the largest of these studies, reported by
Wick et al32 (n ¼ 90), among the subset of patients evaluable for MGMT methylation status (n ¼ 36), median PFS
was 19 weeks in patients with an unmethylated MGMT
promoter compared with 27 weeks in patients with a
methylated MGMT promoter. In the study reported by
Brandes et al,34 33 patients with glioblastoma were treated
with the 21 of 28-day regimen, and no correlation was
observed between MGMT promoter methylation status
and overall response rate, time to progression, or survival.
This observed lack of correlation could be interpreted as
evidence that dose-dense regimens may, to some extent,
overcome MGMT-mediated resistance and improve outcomes in the unmethylated subset. However, these studies
may not have been sufficiently powered, and multiple factors could have confounded the analysis.
Thus, further study of dose-dense temozolomide
regimens is needed to clarify whether they can overcome
MGMT-mediated resistance. Larger randomized studies
in which patients are prospectively stratified on the basis
of MGMT promoter methylation status are required to establish whether dose-dense temozolomide regimens can
increase the sensitivity of unmethylated tumors to temozolomide. The recently completed, phase 3 Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group 0525/EORTC trial (n ¼
1169) was prospectively designed to address this question
(Fig. 1).

Regimen-Dependent Toxicity of
Temozolomide
The greater dose intensity achieved with alternative temozolomide regimens does not appear to significantly
increase the frequency of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. Available data from phase 2 trials indicate a high incidence of lymphopenia, particularly in patients with
recurrent glioma treated with the 21 of 28-day regimen
(Table 2).32-36,56,57 Moreover, the incidence of severe
lymphopenia appears to correlate with cumulative
dose.36,57 Importantly, some patients treated with the 21
of 28-day regimen at an initial dose of 100 mg/m2 have
developed profound and prolonged myelosuppression after the first treatment cycle, with blood counts recovering to normal only after 12 weeks.36 Therefore, at least
in the recurrent setting, a lower initial dose may be advisable in the first treatment cycle to identify patients
with lower tolerance. In comparison, the 7 of 14-day
regimen appears to be associated with a lower incidence
of lymphopenia. However, in the EORTC 18,032 trial,

2872

the incidence of lymphopenia was significantly higher
with the 7 of 14-day dosing regimen compared with
dacarbazine monotherapy.58
As a result of lymphopenia, patients treated with
dose-dense temozolomide regimens are at increased risk
for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and other
opportunistic infections. Although the reported incidence
of grade 3/4 lymphopenia is high in some studies (Table
2), the reported incidence of lethal or life-threatening
opportunistic infections has remained relatively low,
highlighting the importance of proactively addressing infectious complications. Physicians treating patients with
dose-dense temozolomide regimens should actively monitor pulmonary health and should consider PCP prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at a dose of
1 single-strength tablet daily or 1 double-strength tablet
3 per week is the standard prophylactic therapy for
PCP. Pentamidine 300 mg monthly by aerosol is an alternative.58 Additional clinical variables such as older age,
concomitant RT, concurrent corticosteroids, and poor

performance status are also likely to increase risk for infections. In addition, prophylactic antifungal and antiviral
(mainly antiherpetic) drugs might be needed to control
the risk of infection or viral reactivation.
Furthermore, because temozolomide is a DNAdamaging agent, secondary malignancies are a potential
cause for concern. Although the 5 of 28-day regimen has
no known cumulative side effects, and the number of
patients reported to have developed secondary myelodysplasia, leukemia, or aplastic anemia is low,59-62 the
increased total dose delivered with dose-dense regimens
could potentially increase the risk for delayed toxicity or
secondary malignancies. This concern is particularly relevant in populations with a better prognosis, such as
patients with LGG. A recent case report on 3 patients who
developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma after treatment with
temozolomide exemplifies this risk.63 Notably, 2 of these
patients received dose-dense temozolomide (12 cycles
of 21 of 28-day regimen).
Immunomodulatory Effects of
Lymphodepletion
Intuitively, it might be expected that lymphodepletion
associated with chemotherapy would suppress the
immune response to tumor antigens and compromise the
therapeutic potential of immunomodulatory strategies.
This is particularly relevant in melanoma, where cytotoxic
agents, including temozolomide, are often investigated in
combination with immunomodulatory agents such as
IFN-a, interleukin (IL)-2, thalidomide, or cytotoxic
T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4–blocking antibodies.
In an effort to understand better the potential clinical implications of lymphodepletion, investigators have
examined whether temozolomide selectively depletes
specific subsets of lymphocytes such as effector (CD8þ)
T cells or regulatory (CD4þ/CD25þ/FOXP3þ) T cells.
Depletion of effector T cells might be expected to cause
immunosuppression, whereas depletion of regulatory
T cells might be expected to enhance antitumor immunity. Indeed, a recent study reported that metronomic
cyclophosphamide (50 mg 3 per day) induced profound
and selective reduction of regulatory T cells in patients
with advanced cancer, thereby relieving suppression of
cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and restoring their innate antitumor activity.64 These observations
are also supported by recent preclinical data in a glioma
model suggesting that low-dose metronomic temozolomide (corresponding to 3 mg/m2/d) depletes regulatory
T cells and may ameliorate their immune suppressive

Cancer

activity.65 In contrast, other studies have provided some
evidence that effector T cells may be depleted by dosedense temozolomide regimens. For example, in a retrospective analysis of 97 melanoma patients treated with
dose-dense temozolomide (75 mg/m2/d) either as monotherapy or in combination with thalidomide or low-dose
IFN-a, lymphopenia (defined as absolute lymphocyte
count [ALC] 800/lL) occurred in 60% of patients, and
preferential depletion of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells was
observed.66 Further analysis of 3 patients with severe lymphopenia (ALC 500/lL) demonstrated marked suppression of CD4þ/CD25þ T-cell subsets, whereas B-cell
(CD3/CD19þ) and NK-cell (CD3/CD56þ/CD16þ)
subsets were within the lower limits of normal. Patients in
this retrospective cohort also experienced a high incidence
of opportunistic infections (22%), indicative of T-cell
dysfunction. In our own unpublished study in melanoma
patients who were treated with the 21 of 28-day regimen
(100 mg/m2/d), global depletion of all lymphocyte subsets was observed when lymphocyte counts fell below
500/lL (grade 3). At present, there is no conclusive evidence that temozolomide can be used to predictably
deplete any particular lymphocyte subset at any given
dose or schedule. Further research is, therefore, needed to
determine how metronomic low-dose schedules can
potentially be used to preferentially deplete regulatory
T cells.
In addition, preclinical studies have elucidated physiologic rebound responses to global lymphodepletion that
may enhance antitumor immune responses.67,68 Possible
mechanisms underlying these rebound responses include
elimination of endogenous cytokine sinks for homeostatic
cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15, depletion of regulatory
T cells, and enhanced proliferation of effector lymphocytes. IL-7 and IL-15 are important for CD8þ T-cell
function and antitumor activity. After lymphodepletion
or other myeloablative conditioning regimens, cells that
normally compete for IL-7 and IL-15 are eliminated,
increasing availability of these cytokines and lowering the
threshold for T-cell activation. After lymphodepletion,
antigen-activated effector T and B lymphocytes also proliferate rapidly. Furthermore, lymphodepletion appears to
erase immune memory (as evidenced by a loss of recall
responses to common antigens) and may reduce tumormediated tolerance to tumor antigens.69 The result is a
more robust response to tumor-associated antigens. This
is particularly relevant in patients with glioblastoma and
melanoma, based on evidence of increased infiltration of
lymphocytes (including regulatory T cells) into tumor

2873

Review Article

tissue, which is correlated with poor prognosis.70,71 Thus,
lymphodepletion may reset the host immune system and
reduce or eliminate host tolerance to autologous tumor
antigens. This has led to the hypothesis that the efficacy of
antitumor vaccines could be enhanced if they are administered immediately after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.
In light of the availability of well-characterized tumor
antigens associated with glioma and melanoma,69,72 this
hypothesis could be readily tested.
Combination of temozolomide with antitumor
vaccines and immune modulatory therapy

Few studies have examined the influence of temozolomide on the immune response to anticancer vaccines,
but several proof of concept studies have been conducted.
In a phase 1/2 study in melanoma, 81% of patients treated
with the standard 5 of 28-day schedule of temozolomide
and the telomerase peptide vaccine GV1001 (hTERT:
611-626) had an immune response to GV1001 at 12
weeks, and patients who received 9 cycles of temozolomide had a stable proliferative response to GV1001
throughout the treatment period.73 Another recent study
in melanoma patients demonstrated significantly
improved and durable CD8þ T-cell memory responses to
HLA-2–restricted melanoma antigen A and gp100 peptides when the vaccines were administered 1 day after
dacarbazine treatment.74 A recent study of temozolomide
plus an anti–epidermal growth factor receptor variant III
(anti-EGFRvIII) peptide vaccine (PEPvIII-KLH) provided preliminary evidence in support of the hypothesis
that dose-dense temozolomide regimens might enhance
response to an antitumor vaccine. In this phase 2 multicenter study (ACT II, reported at the American Society of
Clinical Oncology 2008 annual meeting), patients with
newly diagnosed glioblastoma whose tumors expressed
EGFRvIII underwent complete surgical resection
(>95%) followed by concomitant RT plus temozolomide.69 Twenty days after completing RT, patients
received 3 intradermal immunizations (every 2 weeks)
with the PEPvIII-KLH vaccine plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor followed by adjuvant
temozolomide with either the standard 5 of 28-day regimen or the dose-dense 21 of 28-day regimen. Patients
received further immunizations with the PEPvIII-KLH
vaccine on Day 21 of each cycle of adjuvant temozolomide (Fig. 1).
During the adjuvant phase, ALC decreased to a
greater extent, more consistently, and in a cumulative
fashion in patients treated with the 21 of 28-day regimen

2874

compared with the 5 of 28-day regimen. In the majority
of patients who completed 6 cycles of adjuvant treatment
with the 21 of 28-day regimen, lymphocyte counts were
<500/lL (grade 3). Unexpectedly, anti-PEPvIII antibody titers were >10-fold higher in patients treated with
the 21 of 28-day regimen. In addition, the delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reaction to the vaccine also
became increasingly stronger in this group, an effect that
was not observed with the standard 5 of 28-day regimen.
In contrast, the DTH response to a control antigen
(Candida) did not increase in either group, but decreased
only in patients treated with the 21 of 28-day regimen,
suggesting a greater loss of memory T cells. Median time
to progression and median OS for patients who received
the EGFRvIII peptide vaccine in the ACT II trial compared favorably with matched historical controls treated
with standard RT plus temozolomide. These preliminary
results support the hypothesis that lymphodepletion associated with the dose-dense 21 of 28-day temozolomide
regimen may enhance the immune response, and particularly the humoral immune response (production of antivaccinal antibodies) to tumor vaccines, which may
translate into improved clinical benefit.
In patients with melanoma, the combination of
immunotherapeutic strategies after lymphodepletion has
also been explored, although not using temozolomide.
Several studies have investigated the benefit of adoptive
cell therapy, a process by which tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are harvested, stimulated in vitro with tumor
antigens, expanded, and then reinfused. Recent studies of
adoptive cell therapy preceded by lymphodepletion with
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in patients with metastatic melanoma reported favorable response rates (49%72%) compared with a study in which patients received
minimal or no lymphodepletion before adoptive cell therapy (34%).75 These studies also reported elevation of
serum levels of IL-7 and IL-15 after lymphodepletion.
Therefore, there is evidence to suggest that controlled
lymphodepletion may be used to generate positive immunomodulatory effects. Moreover, the use of dose-dense
temozolomide to achieve lymphodepletion before adoptive cell therapy or therapeutic antitumor vaccination
might have added benefits in patients with melanoma or
glioma, because temozolomide has direct antitumor activity in these patient populations.
Conclusions and Future Directions
Dose-dense temozolomide regimens are being investigated widely based on their potential to enhance

Cancer

antitumor activity and overcome MGMT-mediated drug
resistance. At present, however, definitive evidence that
MGMT-mediated resistance to temozolomide can be
overcome in tumor tissues remains elusive. Whether the
potential benefits associated with these regimens will outweigh the added toxicity in patients with glioma and melanoma awaits confirmation from prospective randomized
trials. For example, the recently concluded EORTC
18,032 study in patients with melanoma demonstrated
that the efficacy of dose-dense temozolomide was similar
to that of dacarbazine.52 Recently completed and ongoing
trials evaluating the 21 of 28-day regimen as adjuvant
therapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
and as primary treatment for LGG will no doubt provide
further crucial insights into the therapeutic potential and
safety of these regimens in patients with glioma. An additional intriguing aspect of dose-dense temozolomide
regimens relates to the emerging evidence that temozolomide-associated lymphodepletion may have clinically important immunomodulatory effects and may enhance the
response to antitumor vaccines or adoptive cell therapy
strategies. These pilot observations warrant further
investigation.
