Cytotoxic chemotherapy is effective in debulking tumour masses initially; however, in some
patients tumours become progressively unresponsive after multiple treatment cycles. Previous
studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are selectively enriched after
chemotherapy through enhanced survival1–3. Here we reveal a new mechanism by which bladder
CSCs actively contribute to therapeutic resistance via an unexpected proliferative response to repopulate residual tumours between chemotherapy cycles, using human bladder cancer xenografts.
Further analyses demonstrate the recruitment of a quiescent label-retaining pool of CSCs into cell
division in response to chemotherapy-induced damages, similar to mobilization of normal stem
cells during wound repair4–7. While chemotherapy effectively induces apoptosis, associated

prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release paradoxically promotes neighbouring CSC repopulation. This
repopulation can be abrogated by a PGE2-neutralizing antibody and celecoxib drug-mediated
blockade of PGE2 signalling. In vivo administration of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitor
celecoxib effectively abolishes a PGE2- and COX2-mediated wound response gene signature, and
attenuates progressive manifestation of chemoresistance in xenograft tumours, including primary
xenografts derived from a patient who was resistant to chemotherapy. Collectively, these findings
uncover a new underlying mechanism that models the progressive development of clinical
chemoresistance, and implicate an adjunctive therapy to enhance chemotherapeutic response of
bladder urothelial carcinomas by abrogating early tumour repopulation.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care for many advanced carcinomas.
Although chemotherapy is effective in debulking tumour mass, certain patients show initial
response but progressively become unresponsive after multiple treatments. Chemotherapy is
administered in cycles to induce fractionated killing of unsynchronized proliferating cancer
cells, and treatments are spaced out to allow recovery of normal tissues between cycles8.
However, repopulation of residual surviving cancer cells also occurs, which is an
undesirable phenomenon that limits chemotherapeutic response in subsequent cycles8.
Recent studies demonstrated that CSCs have a survival advantage in response to
chemotherapy1–3. Here we investigate the unexplored concept that CSCs may actively
proliferate in response to chemotherapy-induced damages, similar to how tissue resident
stem cells mobilize to wound sites during tissue repair4–7,9.

Bladder urothelial carcinomas contain cells that span various cellular differentiation
stages10–15, cytokeratin 14 (CK14) marks the most primitive (or least differentiated)
cells11,13 and patients with abundant CK14 staining correlate with poor survival11,13. Here,
comparative analysis of matching pre- and post-chemotherapy patient tissues revealed one
group with CK14 staining enrichment/persistence (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c) and
another group with no CK14 staining after chemotherapy (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig.
1a, b, d). Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed patients with CK14+ cancer cell enrichment/
persistence showed worse survival (Fig. 1a), justifying further need to investigate their
chemotherapeutic response. Using the standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced bladder
urothelial carcinomas (that is, gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC)), one chemotherapy cycle
effectively reduced the growth rate of all xenograft tumours in comparison to controls (Fig.
1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a), while leading to a generalized enrichment of CK14+ cancer
cells (1.7–4.3-fold) (Fig. 1c, d and Extended Data Fig. 2b, c). This enrichment is
unexpectedly contributed by proliferation marked by mitosis phaseprotein phosphohistone
H3 (Extended Data Fig. 2d, e; white arrows). In addition to the conventional thinking that
chemotherapy selects for chemoresistant cancer cells, this active proliferative response may
represent a new mechanism contributing to repopulation of residual tumours. To investigate
this phenomenon further, we constructed a lentiviral reporter to enable prospective isolation
of CK14+ cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), as CK14 is an intracellular
protein that would not allow for cell surface antibody labelling. We sub-cloned a previously
validated gene promoter region of human KRT14 (ref. 16) into a promoterless lentiviral
vector carrying a tdTomato (hK14. tdTomato) red fluorescent protein (Extended Data Fig.
3a). With this reporter stably transduced into urothelial carcinoma cells (Fig. 1e and

Extended Data Fig. 3b–d), we could readily detect a tdTomato+ (Tm+) subpopulation that
exclusively expressed CK14 at the protein (Fig. 1f; white arrows) and messenger RNA (Fig.
1g; KRT14) levels, while minimally expressing the differentiation marker uroplakin1B (Fig.
1g; UPK1B). These Tm+ CK14+ urothelial carcinoma cells represented a subpopulation of
our previously reported CD44+CD49f+ CSCs11,13 (Extended Data Fig. 3b–d). Additional
functional evaluation validated their unique biological properties being enriched for sphereforming stem cells in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and tumorigenic cells when engrafted in
vivo (Extended Data Fig. 3f), thus demonstrating accepted functional criteria for CSCs. To
evaluate their chemotherapeutic response, we purified Tm+ CK14+ and Tm− CK14− cancer
cells and evaluated their relative cell viability after GC chemotherapy (Fig. 1h and Extended
Data Fig. 4). Tm+ CK14+cancer cells survived chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
significantly better than Tm− CK14− cells starting at day 3 (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig.
4). Concurrent cell cycle analyses revealed an unexpected proliferative response of both
subpopulations by entering into S phase at days 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 1i, j and
Extended Data Fig. 5). Interestingly, Tm− CK14− cancer cells remained proliferative
throughout the 11-day time course, whereas Tm+ CK14+ cancer cells gradually returned to a
less proliferative state (Fig. 1i, j and Extended Data Fig. 5). Because gemcitabine (a cytidine
analogue) and cisplatin preferentially incorporate into proliferating cells to initiate apoptosis
via inducing DNA crosslinks, strand breaks and adduct formation17, we propose that the
slower cycling properties of CK14+ cells may provide one mechanism by which they evade
GC chemotherapy.

To explore this hypothesis in vivo, we used the classical pulse-chase labelling approach to
mark quiescent cells18,19, followed by chemotherapy treatment to analyse their proliferative
response (Fig. 2a). We repetitively pulsed xenograft tumours with the thymidine analogue 5iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU), followed by a 4–8-week chase period, during which dividing
cells diluted out IdU whereas quiescent cells retained IdU18 (Fig. 2a). Effective IdU pulsing
was validated (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and a quiescent cancer subpopulation (1.08–5.48%)
was consistently found (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d), which we term label-retaining cancer
cells (LRCCs) (green cells in Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). These IdU+ LRCCs
predominately localized within CK14+ cells (Fig. 2b, c; red) and were mutually exclusive to
proliferating cells labelled by 5-chloro-2′-deoxyuridine (CldU) (Fig. 2b; white) or other
proliferation markers (Extended Data Fig. 6e–g). Notably, chemotherapy significantly
reduced the fraction of CldU+ proliferating cells while not altering IdU+ LRCCs initially
(Fig. 2d, e; 6 h). These results confirmed our in vitro findings that gemcitabine and cisplatin
preferentially induce apoptosis of dividing cells17 (Fig. 1h, i). This is paradoxically followed
by a significant increase in IdU+ LRCCs that were simultaneously incorporated with CldU
(Fig. 2d, e; 12 h). These IdU+ CldU+ cells constantly appeared as a two-cell state immediate
adjacent to each other (Fig. 2d; yellow cells), suggestive of LRCC recruitment to divide
after chemotherapy-induced apoptotic damage. This trend coincided with an increase in
CldU+ proliferating and CK14+ cancer cells (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 6h;12 h),
which gradually decreased from 24 h and onwards, corresponding with a plateau of single
CldU+ proliferating cancer cells (Fig. 2e). Collectively, these results illustrate that quiescent
LRCCs are unexpectedly recruited into cell division after chemotherapy treatment,
contributing to repopulation of residual tumours.

Next, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying tumour repopulation. After
chemotherapy, it is known that soluble factors are released from apoptotic cells to attract
immune cells for clearance20. Paradoxically, some of these factors are also known to
stimulate epithelial cell proliferation during wound repair. One example is PGE2, which was
demonstrated to promote stem-cell expansion21 and mobilization22. Here, we investigate
PGE2 and CSCs in the context of chemotherapy, which was not studied previously.
Urothelial carcinoma cells were exposed to chemotherapy in vitro (Fig. 3a) and their
viability was quantified by flow cytometry analyses of mitochondrial and plasma membrane
permeability (Fig. 3b) and by cleaved caspase-3 (CASP3) (Fig. 3c). The time kinetics of
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3b, c) is closely associated with an increase in the
expression of COX2 (the enzyme mediating PGE2 production) and PGE2 release (Fig. 3d).
We further validated these findings in vivo, by analysing the co-localization of PGE2,
CASP3 and CK14+ cancer cells, and their associated changes after chemotherapy (Fig. 3e,
f). Similar to in vitro, chemotherapy induced apoptosis as measured by a CASP3-positive
stain, which peaked at 6 h and gradually reduced thereafter (Fig. 3e, f), which was closely
followed by PGE2 release from 6 to 24 h after chemotherapy (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, PGE2
localization (Fig. 3e; red) was often found adjacent to CK14+ cancer cells (Fig. 3e; green).
Altogether, these findings demonstrated that chemotherapy-induced apoptosis is closely
followed by the release of PGE2, which preceded that of tumour repopulation (Fig. 3g).

Author Manuscript

To establish a biological role for PGE2 in promoting tumour repopulation, we investigated
how exogenous dmPGE2 (a stabilized PGE2 analogue) could modulate sphere-forming stem
cells in vitro23. Exogenous dmPGE2 treatment significantly increased the frequency of
sphere-forming cells (Fig. 3h). To evaluate PGE2 in the context of chemotherapy, we
applied PGE2-containing supernatant obtained from chemotherapy-treated cells to urothelial
carcinoma cells (Fig. 3a), and compared their sphere-forming ability to those receiving
exogenous dmPGE2 (Fig. 3i). Although both conditions significantly induced sphereforming cells, supernatant from chemotherapy-treated cells induced a higher frequency (Fig.
3i). Notably, functional blockade of PGE2 by a neutralizing antibody significantly reduced
the ability of factor-containing supernatant to generate sphere-forming cells (Fig. 3i).
Furthermore, the addition of the pharmacological COX2 inhibitor celecoxib, alone or in
combination with a PGE2 neutralizing antibody, further reduced their frequencies (Fig. 3i).

Because more than 70% of patients with advanced bladder cancer do not benefit from
neoadjuvant chemotherapy24–26, and celecoxib is a US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved drug, we evaluated whether the attenuation of PGE2 signalling in vivo
could enhance chemotherapeutic response (Fig. 4a). Although chemotherapy is clinically
administered in multiple cycles, few preclinical studies administered chemotherapy beyond
one cycle or a single dose. To bridge this gap, we recapitulated the clinical regimen (Fig.
4a–e) in advanced bladder cancer xenografts, including one derived from a patient who was
resistant to chemotherapy (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 1a). During the first
chemotherapy cycle, both PDX-3 and T24 xenograft lines were responsive to chemotherapy
(GC) and combination therapy (celecoxib plus GC) by reducing tumour size (Fig. 4b, e;
days 3–12). Nevertheless, celecoxib combination treatment did abrogate notable expansion
of CK14+ cancer cells induced by chemotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Remarkably,

manifestation of chemoresistance occurred progressively after successive chemotherapy
cycles (Fig. 4b, e; black circle), and celecoxib combination treatment (celecoxib plus GC)
enhanced chemotherapeutic response more evidently in later treatment cycles (Fig. 4b, e;
asterisk). T24 bladder cancer xenografts were limited to two chemotherapy cycles owing to
distal lung metastases, and celecoxib combination treatment significantly diminished
metastatic lung foci (Fig. 4c, d). Because celecoxib is known to suppress prostacyclin and
predisposes patients to thrombosis27, patients with cancer prescribed celecoxib as adjuvant
therapy will probably be co-administered with low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection. We
confirmed the antithrombotic efficacy of low-dose aspirin without affecting the overall
efficacy of celecoxib (Extended Data Fig. 8).

Here, our findings highlight a new mechanism by which CK14+ CSCs contribute to the
progressive development of chemoresistance, via their proliferative response to fuel
repopulation of residual tumours during the gap periods between chemotherapy cycles
(Extended Data Fig. 10). Global gene expression profiling further revealed a parallel to
tissue wound response, that chemoresistant tumours elicited enrichment of a ‘woundresponse gene signature’ (Fig. 4f, g and Extended Data Fig. 9a, b), which could be abrogated
by combination celecoxib treatment (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 9c). The PTGS2 gene,
which encodes COX2 and is a core pathway component for PGE2 signalling, is among these
wound-response genes (Fig. 4g, h). Similar findings were found in human bladder
carcinomas that are resistant to chemotherapy (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 9a, d, e), thus
confirming the importance and generalization of PGE2/COX2 signalling during
development of chemoresistance, while other metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway
may also be involved. By validating the efficacy of celecoxib in abrogating chemoresistance
in xenografts derived from a patient who was resistant to chemotherapy, this preclinical
finding provides considerable implications for immediate clinical translation, as the standard
of care for advanced bladder cancers is limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery with
no other therapeutics28–30. This approach to abrogate chemoresistance may extend to other
epithelial tumour types on further functional validation.

METHODS
Acquisition of human bladder urothelial carcinoma tissues

Author Manuscript

With approval from Institutional Review Board (H-26809) and informed consents, we
obtained matching samples of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human bladder tumours
before (collected at the time of transurethral resection of bladder tumour) and after
(collected at the time of radical cystectomy) chemotherapy. Our pathologist selected
representative specimens on review of haematoxylin and eosin slides.
Generation of patient-derived xenografts from human urothelial carcinomas
All mice (immunocompromised Rag2−/ − II2rg−/ − double-knockout mice; Taconic) were
housed in the Animal Facility at Baylor College of Medicine. Freshly isolated patient cancer
tissues (clinical information is summarized in Extended Data Fig. 1a) were obtained with
patient consent under Institutional Review Board (H-25099) approval at Baylor College of
Medicine. Tumour tissues were subdivided into 2–5 mm3 pieces, coated with growth-factor-

reduced matrigel (BD) and media in a 1:1 ratio, and embedded within the subcutaneous
space underneath the skin of mice (male or female, 6–8 weeks old). Successfully
xenografted tumours were then enzymatically dissociated into single cell suspensions and
directly passaged in vivo without prior culturing in vitro, as previously reported10,11. Animal
work was performed in accordance to ethical regulations approved by Baylor College of
Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; AN-5803).
In vitro treatment

Author Manuscript

Immortalized bladder cancer cell line T24 (high-grade) was purchased from ATCC and
maintained in DMEM (HyClone), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and penicillinstreptomycin (Cellgro). Cells used were authenticated and tested for mycoplasma at the
Tissue and Cell Culture Core Laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine. Cells were
incubated with gemcitabine (7.5 ng ml−1; Sigma) 2 h before addition of cisplatin (100 μg
ml−1; Sigma). Determination of cell viability after treatment was based on the analysis of
mitochondrial transmembrane potential by 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6;
Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and cell membrane permeability to propidium iodide (Sigma)
by FACS (BD Fortessa) at the indicated time points (24, 48 and 72 h). CASP3 cleavage was
measured at the indicated time points using standard immunoblotting with rabbit-polyclonal
CASP3 antibody (Cell Signaling, 9662; 1:1,000), COX2 expression was measured with
rabbit-polyclonal COX2 antibody (Cell Signaling, 4842; 1:1,000), GAPDH expression was
measured with mouse-monoclonal GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
sc-137179; 1:400). Appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit/mouse IgG, horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody, Cell Signaling; 1:2,000) were used for detection.
In vivo treatment

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

When xenograft tumours reached a palpable size, mice (male and female) were assigned into
different experimental groups: vehicle control (12.5% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) in
saline) group; GC chemotherapy treatment group; celecoxib treatment group; and celecoxib
plus GC combinatory treatment group. According to the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees (IUCUC) protocol (AN-5803), the maximal allowable size of the tumours could
not exceed 10% of mouse body weight. For systemic administration of a single GC
treatment, mice were treated with either vehicle or sequential intraperitoneal injection of
gemcitabine (60 mg kg−1) and cisplatin (6 mg kg−1) given 4 h apart. For one GC cycle,
cisplatin (6 mg kg−1) was only applied after the first gemcitabine (40 mg kg−1) treatment on
day 2, followed by three consecutive treatments of gemcitabine on days 5, 8 and 11
(GC→G→G→G). The tumours were collected 24 h after the last treatment. In celecoxib
combination treatment experiments, mice were pretreated with celecoxib (5 mg kg−1 daily;
Sigma PZ0008) via intraperitoneal injection 2 days before the initiation of chemotherapy,
followed by daily intraperitoneal administration of celecoxib during chemotherapy or
vehicle treatment cycle.
Immunohistochemical analysis of CK14 in patient samples
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using keratin 14 polyclonal antibody
(Covance, PRB-155P; 1:1,000). Every sample was scored for its CK14 staining by

determining the percentage of visual fields that were CK14 negative (0%), CK14 lowinfiltrating (<25%), CK14 high-infiltrating (25–100%), and CK14 basal-restricted (staining
restricted to the basal layer of urothelium). The final result for each case was the average
score of all visual fields. COX2 staining was performed on serial sections using COX2
monoclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical, 160112; 1:100).
Immunofluorescence analyses

Author Manuscript

Tumour sections were analysed following standard haematoxylin and eosin procedures or
immunostaining protocols as previously reported10. Nikon microscopy and NIS element
software were used for imaging and quantification. Primary antibodies used are listed as
follows:5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (for IdU, BD 347580; 1:100), BrdU (BD 347583,
1:100), BrdU (for CldU, Abcam, ab6326, 1:100), CK14(Covance, PRB-155P, 1:1,000),
CK14(Abcam, ab77684, 1:100), cleaved CASP3 (Cell Signaling, 9661; 1:400), PGE2
(Abcam, ab2318; 1:100), and phosphohistone H3 (Cell Signaling, 3377; 1:1,000).
Generation of hK14.tdTomato lentiviral reporter construct
We developed a lentiviral construct that reports on the activity of human KRT14 promoter
by sub-cloning a previously characterized and validated promoter region of human KRT14
(ref. 16) (obtained from ATCC, MBA-124) using EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymatic
digestion, and inserting this promoter fragment into a promoterless lentiviral vector
(Clontech, 631754) tagged with a DD-tdTomato (Tm) red fluorescent protein (Clontech
Lenti-X DD-tdTomato vector). DD-Tm protein is rapidly targeted to proteasome
degradation unless incubated with Shield1 (Clontech) in vitro.
Limiting dilution analysis of tumour subpopulations

Author Manuscript

For in vivo limiting dilution assay, Tm+ CK14+ and Tm− CK14− tumour cells were purified
by FACS (BD FACS Aria Sorter) and serially diluted to the appropriate cell dose. Cells
were injected and the number of tumours formed from each cell dose injected was scored.
The frequency of cancer stem cells had been calculated using the ELDA software (http://
bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html) provided by the Walter and Eliza Hall
Institute.
qRT–PCR

Author Manuscript

RNA isolation (RNAspin Mini, Illustra, GE Healthcare) and reverse transcription
(Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis, Invitrogen) were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. We used Taqman Gene Expression assay mix (Applied
Biosystems) and FAM-labelled Taqman probes to detect expression of the following genes:
KRT14 (Applied Biosystems, Hs00265033_m1) and UPK1B (Applied Biosystems,
Hs00199583_m1). Relative qPCR (ΔΔCt method) was performed in triplicate using
ABIPrism7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels
were normalized to GAPDH transcript levels (Applied Biosystems, Hs99999905_m1).

Cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

Tm+ and Tm− cells subjected to in vitro GC chemotherapy were collected using trypsin
(Gibco), washed twice with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol for 30 min at room
temperature. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (25 μg ml−1 solution in 4 mM citrate
buffer supplemented with RNase, 10% Triton X-100 and PEG 6000; all from Sigma) and
analysed by FACS (gating strategy excluded cell doublets from analysis).
Dual labelling of slow-cycling and active-proliferating cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Mice were labelled by intraperitoneal injection of IdU (Sigma-Aldrich; 50 mg kg−1
bodyweight), BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich; 50 mg kg−1 bodyweight) or CldU (Sigma-Aldrich). For
labelling of slow-cycling cells, repetitive pulsing of IdU (50 mg kg−1 bodyweight) was
given for 5 consecutive days, followed by various long chase periods (4–8 weeks) to localize
LRCCs. For labelling of proliferating cells, CldU was given 1 h before tumour tissue
collection to localize active cycling cancer cells.
PGE2 ELISA assay
To measure PGE2 release, bladder cancer cells T24 were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 2% FBS and treated with gemcitabine (7.5 ng ml−1; Sigma) and cisplatin (100 μg ml−1;
Sigma). Supernatants were collected 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment initiation. PGE2 levels
in the supernatants were measured by ELISA kit (R&D Systems).
dmPGE2 exogenous treatment

Author Manuscript

T24 cancer cells were plated in a semi-solid sphere-forming assay in the presence of 0.38 ng
ml−1 dmPGE2, 100 nM of neutralizing PGE2 antibody (Cayman Chemical, 10009814), 5
μM celecoxib (Sigma) or vehicle for 12 days23. Clonal derivation of spheres from single
cells was ensured and monitored as described23.
Thromboprophylaxis with aspirin
Immunocompromised mice bearing T24 xenografted tumours were treated with celecoxib
and GC chemotherapy in the presence or absence of aspirin (Sigma) (37.9 μg g−1 twice a
week, equivalent of 162.5 mg daily dose in human) for two cycles, and antithrombotic
activity of aspirin was tested by analysing tail bleeding time. In brief, tails of anaesthetized
mice (1–3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 1–2 L min−1) were transected 1 mm
from the tip with a scalpel, the remaining tail was immersed in 37 °C saline, and the time
until bleeding stopped for more than 1 min was observed and recorded.

RNA-sequencing
Tumour tissues were collected from the animals and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA
isolation was performed using Illustra RNAspin mini kit (GE Healthcare) upon
manufacturer instructions. The Genomic and RNA Profiling Core at Baylor College of
Medicine conducted sample quality checks using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and
Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. A double-stranded DNA library was created using 1 μg of total
RNA, preparing the fragments for hybridization onto a flowcell. First, cDNA was created
using the fragmented 3′ poly(A) selected portion of total RNA and random primers.

Libraries were created from the cDNA by first blunt ending the fragments, attaching an
adenosine to the 3′ end and finally ligating unique adapters to the ends. The ligated products
were then amplified using 15 cycles of PCR. The resulting libraries were quantitated using
the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and fragment size assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer.
A qPCR quantitation was performed on the libraries to determine the concentration of
adaptor ligated fragments using a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System and
a KAPA Library Quant Kit. Using the concentration from the Bio-Rad qPCR machine, 18
pM of library was loaded onto a flowcell and amplified by bridge amplification using the
Illumina cBot machine. A paired-end 100 cycle run was used to sequence the flowcell on the
HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System.
Bioinformatics analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The Philadelphia neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) data (GSE48277) were obtained from
Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), which consisted of
microarray gene expression data of urothelial tumours before and after NAC treatment. The
microarray data were quantile normalized and then log2 transformed. If there were multiple
probes for a gene, we used the probe with median expression value for GSEA. For the RNAseq data analysis, the reads were trimmed from the both ends to 90 nucleotides, and then
mapped to the human genome (UCSC hg19) using Tophat with NCBI RefSeq genes as the
reference and up to two possible mismatches. To reduce possible biases caused by RT–PCR,
read duplicates were removed using samtools. HTseq (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/
anders/HTSeq) was used to determine the number of reads falling in the known genes. The
counts that indicate gene expression values were normalized to have the same total counts
for each sample. The normalized counts were log2 transformed and 1 was added to read
counts to avoid log2 transformation of zeros. Genes with small expression value (count <6)
for all samples were not used for GSEA. The wound response gene signature (GO:0009611–
response to wounding) was obtained from Amigo (http://amigo.geneontology.org)
consisting of 1,163 genes.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) and
included two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test for
comparing the means of two or multiple groups, respectively. P <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. No formal randomization was used in any experiment; for in vivo
experiments animals were unbiasedly assigned into different treatment groups. Group
allocation and outcome assessment was not performed in a blinded manner. No animals or
samples were excluded from data analysis. On the basis of our preliminary results, we
estimated that the tumour sizes in the GC treatment group are about 200 mm3 and we
expected celecoxib plus GC combination treatment would reduce the tumour size to 80–100
mm3. With an estimated standard deviation of 50 mm3 within group, we expected to have at
least 80% power to detect differences of tumour volume (α = 0.05, two-tailed t-test) using a
sample size of 6 mice in each group. For in vivo experiments performed with patient-derived
tumour cells, the sample size was dependent on the number of viable cells isolated upon
tumour dissociation. Generally, at least six tumours were analysed for each group tested. In

Extended Data Figure 10. Schematic model: recurrent CSC repopulation and its manifestation
of chemoresistance

Cytotoxic chemotherapy effectively induces apoptosis but paradoxically elicits a wound
response of bladder cancer stem cells to proliferate and repopulate residual tumours. Release
of PGE2 from neighbouring apoptotic cancer cells is sufficient to promote this CSC
repopulation. In vivo administration of celecoxib effectively abolishes this PGE2/COX2mediated wound response gene signature, and attenuates progressive manifestation of
chemoresistance in preclinical models of human urothelial carcinomas.
