ABSTRACT
Resveratrol is a potential polyphenol drug used in cancer treatment. We
examined the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in RSV-treated nonsmall lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Resveratrol treatment increased autophagy
and autophagy-mediated degradation of P62. Immunocytochemistry revealed P62
co-localized with Fas/Cav-1 complexes, known to induce apoptosis. However,
siRNA-mediated P62 downregulation enhanced formation of Fas/Cav-1 complexes,
suggesting that P62 inhibited Fas/Cav-1 complex formation. Fas/Cav-1 complexes
triggered caspase-8 activation and cleavage of Beclin-1, releasing a C-terminal
Beclin-1 peptide that translocated to the mitochondria and initiate apoptosis.
Inhibition of autophagy by siRNA-mediated repression of Beclin-1 also blocked RSVinduced apoptosis, showing a dependence of apoptosis on autophagy. P62 knockdown
by siRNA accelerated the activation of caspase-8 and initiate apoptosis, while Cav-1
knockdown inhibited apoptosis, but increased autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy
by 3-MA prevented both P62 degradation and induction of apoptosis, whereas
inhibition of apoptosis by z-IETD-FMK or z-DEVD-FMK enhanced both P62 induction
and autophagic cell death. In conclusion, P62 links resveratrol-induced autophagy to
apoptosis. P62 blocks apoptosis by inhibiting Fas/Cav-1 complex formation, but RSVinduced autophagic degradation of P62 enables formation of Fas/Cav-1 complexes
which then activate caspase-8-mediated Beclin-1 cleavage, resulting in translocation
of the Beclin-1 C-terminal fragment to the mitochondria to initiate apoptosis.

have also attracted an immense amount of attention for
its potential antitumor activity [9]. Additionally, RSV is
currently in phase I clinical development with preliminary
evidence of antitumor activity [10]. However, the actual
mechanisms of RSV-induced cell death and the specific
molecular targets of RSV in A549 cancer cells have not
yet fully established.
Autophagy, literally interpreted as “self-eating”,
is a highly evolutionarily conserved catabolic process in
eukaryotes and plays an important role in the recycling
of cellular components [11]. It is involved in various
biological processes, such as adaptation to changing
environmental conditions, cellular remodeling during

INTRODUCTION
Resveratrol (trans 3, 4’, 5-trihydroxystilbene; RSV),
a polyphenol phytoalexin found in grapes, peanuts and
other plants, is well-known for its potential antioxidant,
anti-tumorigenic activities [1–4], extends lifespan by
activate Sirt1 [5, 6]. Accumulated reports demonstrate
that RSV has the ability to affect tumor initiation and
promotion, arrest angiogenesis and metastasis, and induce
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [7]. Previous studies have
indicated that resveratrol inhibits the proliferation of A549
non-small adenocarcinoma cells and induces apoptosis [8].

development and differentiation, and cancer [12].
Crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy exists to
regulate cell death. Recent studies have shown that several
molecules required for autophagy also play a key role in
apoptosis. For example, cleavage of Beclin-1, a wellknown protein required for the initiation of the formation
of the autophagosome, generates a pro-apoptotic protein
fragment that translocates to the mitochondria and
interacts with the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BclxL to antagonize autophagy and initiate mitochondrial
apoptosis [13, 14]. An increasing number of reports show
that members of the caspase family, such as caspase-3 and
caspase-8, participate in the cleavage of Beclin-1 [15, 16].
The apoptosis initiator Fas, is a well-documented
mediator in the apoptotic process. Activated Fas induces
the cleavage and activation of caspase-8, which induces
apoptosis through caspase-3 activation or cleaves t-Bid to
change the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) [17,
18]. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), as a scaffolding protein within
the plasma membrane microdomains, is an important
regulator that interacts between signaling proteins and Fas
[19]. Recent emerging evidences suggest that Cav-1 plays
a critical role in the regulation of a wide range of cellular
processes, including the regulation of signal transduction,
cell death, and survival [19]. However, it is still unknown
the actual function of Cav-1 involved in autophagy.
The signaling adaptor P62 protein, also called
sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), is commonly found in
inclusion bodies containing polyubiquitinated protein
aggregates. P62 is a functional protein with multiplebinding domains that can combine with several proteins
and bring them into the autophagolysosome for
degradation during autophagy [20]. Recent work reveals
that P62 acts as a signaling hub through its ability to recruit
and oligomerize signaling molecules in cytosolic speckles
to control cell survival and apoptosis, and elimination of
P62 by autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis [21]. The
overexpression of p62 contributed to ROS production
in a positive feedback loop, thereby leading to increased
genome instability [22]. Other reports showed that p62 was
able to maintain and stabilize the integrity and functions
of mitochondria for the longevity or immortalization of
mammalian cells [23]. The accumulation of p62 reflected
the inhibition of proteasomal activities [24]. These
discoveries suggest that P62 is a central player in the life
and death decisions of cells. The role of P62 involved in
the linkage between autophagy and apoptosis is still not
yet fully understood.
We and others have previously demonstrated that
RSV drives tumor cells toward autophagic cell death [9].
In this study, we investigate whether p62 plays a role in
regulating the processes of autophagy and apoptosis, and
how p62 regulates the switch between these two processes.
Here we demonstrate that in human A549 cells, cell death
undergoes a transition from autophagy to apoptosis after

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prolonged treatment with RSV (more than 48 hours).
The switch from autophagy to apoptosis is governed by
P62-mediated formation of Cav-1 and Fas complexes that
activate cleavage of caspase-8 and Beclin-1 to regulate
autophagy and apoptosis.

RESULTS
RSV induces growth inhibition and cell death in
A549 cells
To investigate the cytotoxic activity of RSV on
A549 cells, exponentially growing cells were incubated
with 50 μM RSV, then cell viability was measured at
various times following RSV addition (Fig. 1A). The
number of viable cells decreased in a time-dependent
manner to 65.8% and 40% at 24 and 72 h, respectively,
after RSV treatment. Further analysis by clonogenic assay
demonstrated that RSV treatment caused a reduction in
both the size and number of colonies, in agreement with
our cell proliferation assay (Fig. 1B & 1C). Thus, the data
suggested that RSV arrested A549 cell proliferation and
induced cell death.

RSV induces early autophagy followed by
apoptosis in A549 cells
To investigate RSV-induced autophagy and
apoptosis in A549 cells, we exposed cells with 50 μM
RSV for up to 96 h. Both autophagy and apoptosis were
induced by RSV in a time-dependent manner, as indicated
by markers LC3 and cleaved caspase-3. As shown in
Fig. 2A, LC3II emerged after RSV treatment for 12 h, and
reached a peak around 24 h, followed by appearance of
cleaved caspase-3 at 48 h, which became more prominent
with time. To test the case, cells were pre-treated with
3-methyladenine (3-MA) (Fig. 2A) or Z-Asp (OMe)-Glu
(OMe)-Val-Asp (OMe)-FMK (Z-DEVD-FMK) (Fig. 2A)
for 1 hour before RSV treatment and then analyzed for
autophagy and apoptosis. We also analyzed apoptotic
morphologic changes by DAPI staining (Supplementary
Fig. 1A) and autophagic vacuole formation by staining
with the autolysosome indicator monodansylcadaverine
(MDC) (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The results demonstrated
that RSV induced apoptosis 48 h after treatment with RSV,
which was strongly reduced by Z-DEVD-FMK, whereas
RSV-induced autophagy was evident by 12 h, increased up
to 24 h, then dramatically dropped to low levels by 48 h.
To further confirm that autophagy and apoptosis
are both activated in RSV-treated cells, we then
detected LC3 and cleaved caspase-3 simultaneously
by immunofluorescence staining in the same samples
(Fig. 2B). Results indicated that the number of LC3
speckles increased prior to 48 h, and cleaved caspase-3
increased after 48 h in a time-dependent manner. Next, we

determined apoptotic cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C).
The non-treated cells, as well as cells treated with RSV
for less than 48 h, had a low percentage of apoptotic cells
(2% and less than 20%, respectively). However, when
cells were incubated with RSV for 72 h, the percentage of
apoptotic cells increased to 61% .This increase in apoptosis
was blocked by the caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK
(decreased to 18.4%). Enzymatic activity of caspase-3 also
increased after 48 h following RSV treatment (Fig. 2D),
which could be inhibited by incubation of cells with
Z-DEVD-FMK. In conclusion, the above results indicate

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that autophagy and apoptosis are both activated by RSV in
a specific time course, and induction of autophagy occurs
prior to the activation of apoptosis.

RSV activates caspase-8 and its functions in
autophagy and apoptosis
To determine whether caspase-8 is involved in
RSV-induced autophagy and apoptosis, we examined
cleaved caspase-8 by Western blot. Caspase-8 cleavage
forms were clearly detectable at 24 h after RSV treatment

used as a loading control. (B) Autophagy (LC3) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) were detected by immunofluorescence as described in

(Fig. 3A), and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 increased with
time, especially after 48 h. This correlated well with the
timing of cytochrome C release from the mitochondria
to the cytosol (Fig. 3A). Combined treatment with
Z-Ile-Glu(OMe)- Thr-Asp(OMe)-FMK(Z-IETD-FMK)
could reverse RSV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B). To
confirm that apoptosis was induced through a change in
mitochondrial membrane permeability, we then analyzed
the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) with the
indicator Rho123. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2A,
the mean fluorescence intensity was reduced significantly
at 48 h after treatment with RSV, illustrating that MMP
was decreased by the action of RSV in a time-dependent
manner, and caspase-8 inhibition could reduce the action.
Next, we examined cell viability by MTT assay. Cells
in the presence of Z-IETD-FMK had a higher survival
rate compared with cells in the absence of the caspase-8
inhibitor (Fig. 3C). We then detected the effect of Z-IETDFMK on caspase-3 enzymatic activity (Fig. 3D). The results
from flow cytometry showed that Z-IETD-FMK reduced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3E). In conclusion,
RSV activated caspase-8 and then triggered apoptosis.
To further demonstrate the role of caspase-8 in
autophagy, we examined the levels of LC3-I and II in the
prescence or absence of Z-IETD-FMK. Conversion of LC3-I
to II was increased in the presence of the caspase-8 inhibitor
(Fig. 3B), suggesting that caspase-8 may function as an
inhibitor of autophagy. We next examined the co-expression
of cleaved caspase-8 and the autophagy marker-LC3,
following RSV addition, by immunofluorescence. The
amount of LC3 co-expressed with cleaved caspase-8
significantly increased after RSV treatment for 24 h and
became more evident in the combined treatment of RSV
and Bafilomycin A, an inhibitor of autophagic protein
degradation (Supplementary Fig. 2B), suggesting that
caspase-8 could be degraded by autophagy. From the above
results we conclude that activation of caspase-8 functions as
a switch to inhibit autophagy and at the same time to initiate
apoptosis. Therefore our results demonstrate that autophagy
promotes the cleavage and activation of caspase-8.

Caspase-8 cleaves Beclin-1 to inhibit RSVinduced autophagy and promote apoptosis

deficiency results in inhibition of autophagy. Intriguingly,
we found that when Beclin-1 was knocked down, cell
conversion to apoptosis was inhibited (Fig. 4C). Enzymatic
activity of caspase-3 (Fig. 4D) and flow cytometry (Fig.4E)
indicated that the extent of apoptosis in Beclin-1-deficient
cells was reduced. MTT assay indicated that cell viability
was substantially increased in Beclin-1 knockdown cells
following RSV addition, and caspase-8 inhibition had
little effect on cell survival, although caspase-3 inhibition
increased survival (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Therefore, the
above results suggested that Beclin-1 cleavage by caspase-8
is required for RSV-mediated apoptosis.
To confirm the truncated form of Beclin-1
indeed functions to enhance apoptosis, we examined
the localization of Beclin-1 in mitochondria. Cleaved
Beclin-1 was found to translocate to the mitochondria
in a time-dependent manner, but full length Beclin-1
was mainly localized in the cytosol. Translocation was
dramatically inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK (Supplementary
Fig. 3C). As shown in the figure, the green color represents
mitochondrial, the red color represents FL-Beclin-1
and C-Beclin-1, C-Beclin-1 aggregates and form big

Because caspase-8 can cleave Beclin-1 to release a
pro-apoptotic peptide, we defined the role of Beclin-1 in
autophagy and apoptosis by first examining the expression
of Beclin-1 mRNA by Q-PCR. Expression of Beclin-1
increased in a time-dependent manner following RSV
addition (Supplementary Fig. 3A). We next detected the
expression of full length Beclin-1and Beclin-1 cleavage
products by western blot. Interestingly, cleaved Beclin-1
started to appear at 48 h and continued to increase up
to 96 h. Conversely, the level of full length Beclin-1
gradually declined (Fig. 4A upper panel). Therefore, we
conclude that RSV activates cleavage of Beclin-1, and this
action requires caspase-8 (Fig. 4A lower panel).
The functional consequences of Beclin-1 in autophagy
and apoptosis were examined using Beclin-1 siRNA
knockdown. Results shown in Fig. 4B indicated that MDC
fluorescence was dramatically decreased in Beclin-1 siRNAtransfected cells, and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II
was reduced. These results clearly showed that Beclin-1

full-Beclin-1 in the figure diffused outside the nuclear.
To further analyze the function of cleaved Beclin-1 in
apoptosis, we extracted the mitochondrial and cytosolic
subcellular fractions to determine the levels of Beclin-1
by western blot (Fig. 4F). Beclin-1 localized in the
mitochondria was mainly in its cleaved form, whereas full
length beclin-1 was present in cytosol. In addition, RSVinduced cytochrome C release from the mitochondria to
cytosol was decreased following Beclin-1 knockdown.
In sum, the results above suggest that the cleavage of
Beclin-1 by caspase-8 could inactivate autophagy and
subsequently induce cell death through the intrinsic
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

and RSV increased the level of p62 protein and the cleavage
form of Caspase-8 (was also observed in Supplementary
Fig. 2B) compared with the group treated with RSV alone
(Fig. 5B). However, one intriguing observation is that
3-MA decreased Beclin-1 levels, but not through inhibition
of cleavage since the cleavage form of Beclin-1 also
reduced in 3-MA combined treatment group (Fig. 5B).
To determine whether the reduction of Beclin-1 protein
by 3-MA was caused by inhibiting gene transcription, we
examined the level of Beclin-1 mRNA after treatment with
3-MA (Fig. 5C). 3-MA treatment markedly lowered the
level of Beclin-1 mRNA, with a temporal pattern consistent
with the change in protein level.
To further investigate the function of P62, we
then knockdown P62 by using P62 specific siRNA, the
knockdown efficiency was shown in Fig. 5D. Our results
showed that P62 knockdown augmented cell apoptosis (Fig.
5E & 5F). To further elaborate the involvement of P62 in
Beclin-1-mediated apoptosis, we determined the levels of
full-length and cleaved Beclin-1 in the mitochondrial and
cytosolic fractions by western blot analysis. Immunoblotting
indicated RSV induced cleavage and mitochondrial

translocation of Beclin-1 following p62 knockdown (Fig.
5G). In addition, the release of cytochrome C from the
mitochondria to cytosol was enhanced in P62-deficient
cells. (Fig. 5G). Results in Supplementary Fig. 4A further
indicated that the Beclin-1 cleavage fragment was localized
in mitochondrial compartment, and full length Beclin-1 was
localized in cytosol in P62 knockdown cells.
To further confirm the involvement of P62 in
apoptosis, we analyzed the apoptosis-related proteins by
western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 4B). The data showed
that P62-deficient cells had a higher extent of apoptosis,
which was blocked by caspase-8 inhibition. These results
were also confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5H). MTT
assay demonstrated that wild-type A549 cells had a
higher survival ratio than cells treated with P62 siRNA
(Supplementary Fig. 4C). All the above showed clearly
that caspase inhibitors could block apoptosis induced by
knocking down P62. In conclusion, when P62 was degraded
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by autophagy, the low level of P62 resulted in activation
of caspase-8 to induce the cleavage of Beclin-1, whose
cleavage product then functioned as an effector to initiate
apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

Fas/Cav-1 complex links P62 and Beclin-1 to
transition from autophagy to apoptosis
Cav-1 is a plasma membrane-localized scaffolding
protein that links Fas to down-stream signaling pathways
[19, 25]. The involvement of Cav-1 and Fas in RSVinduced cell apoptosis is still unknown. To increase
our understanding of the conversion from autophagy
to apoptosis by P62 and Beclin-1, we analyzed the colocalization of Fas with Cav-1. Both Fas and Cav-1
increased in expression and enhanced their co-localization
after exposure to RSV (Fig. 6A & 6B). We then examined
the role of the Fas/Cav-1 complex in the conversion from
795

autophagy to apoptosis. P62 co-localized with Fas and
Cav-1 in a time-dependent manner from 24 h to 72 h (Fig.
6C), the related purified-IgG pull down group loaded as
control to the specific antibody we used. Treatment with
3-MA induced aggregation of P62 (as shown in Fig. 5B)
and decreased the amount of Fas-Cav-1 interaction (Fig.
6D-a). However, P62 siRNA-transfected cells displayed
higher Fas-Cav-1 interaction compared with wild type
cells, regardless of whether Fas or Cav-1 antibody was
used to detect the interaction complex (Fig. 6D-b), but
there was no change in total levels of Fas and Cav-1 in cells
treated or not treated with 3-MA and P62 siRNA. These
results suggest that P62 regulates RSV-induced apoptosis
by mediating the Fas and Cav-1 complex formation.
We next investigated whether Cav-1 affects the
collective changes in caspase-8, Beclin-1, caspase-3 and
apoptotic proteins. Cav-1 knockdown inhibited RSVinduced cleavage of caspase-8, Beclin-1, and caspase-3,
(Fig. 6E), suggesting that Cav-1 deficiency suppresses
apoptosis. Cav-1 knockdown alone did not change cell
viability, as judged by MTT assay (Fig. 6G). However,
3-MA inhibited cell death of RSV-treated Cav-1-deficient
cells, but Z-IETD-FMK had no effect. These results suggest
that knockdown of Cav-1 blocked the activation of apoptosis
within cells that were still undergoing autophagy. To
confirm this, we analyzed LC3 by western blot. As shown
in Fig. 6E, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was enhanced in
Cav-1-deficient cells. We then stained for autophagosomes
with MDC. MDC fluorescence was increased in Cav-1deficient cells (Fig. 6F). We therefore concluded that Cav-1
is required for conversion from autophagy to apoptosis.
To expand our knowledge regarding the role of Cav-1
in apoptosis in P62-deficient cells, we co-transfected P62
siRNA and Cav-1 siRNA in A549 cells. Cav-1 knockdown
inhibited the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3,
as well as cleavage of Beclin-1 compared with cells
transfected with P62 siRNA alone (Fig. 6H). Moreover,
Cav-1 knockdown could reverse the cell death induced
by P62 knockdown (Fig. 6I). In summary, the above
results suggest that Fas and Cav-1 complex formation is
important in RSV-induced apoptosis, and Cav-1 functions
to protect cells by blocking the transition from autophagy
to apoptosis by forming a complex with Fas.

pathway [9]. Recently, autophagy and apoptosis, and the
relationship between them are a subject of intense debate.
Successive activation of both autophagy and apoptosis
are observed in many systems. In this study, we observe
degradation of P62 by autophagy after cell treatment with
RSV, which results in time-dependent cell death associated
with the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Caspase-8
as an apoptosis effector, is always involved in extrinsic
apoptosis mediated by death receptors [26], but recent
literatures show caspase-8 is accompanied by autophagy,
and that active form of casapse-8 can degraded by
autophagy, which serves as a balance to control autophagy
and apoptosis [27–29]. Our results demonstrate that
caspase-8 decreases along with the activation of autophagy
induced by RSV, but inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA
or Bafilomycin A increases the active form of caspase-8,
confirming previous reports that autophagy decreases
cleavage of caspase-8. Our results also demonstrate that
after treatment with RSV, caspase-8 induces the cleavage
of Beclin-1, leading to inhibition of autophagy. Our results
showing that inhibition of caspase-8 activation prevents
Beclin-1 cleavage are in agreement with prior reports,
which show that cleavage of Beclin-1 by caspase family
members results in inactivation of autophagy [15, 16].
Autophagy and apoptosis both are essential
biological processes in maintaining cell stability, structure
and function, and proper development. We demonstrate
that RSV sequentially induces autophagy and apoptosis,
with autophagy as an initial response prior to apoptosis,
supporting previous reports [30, 31]. We also show that
RSV induces activation of caspase-8 to cleave Beclin-1
and induce apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial
pathway. Previously, Li H et al. [16] demonstrated that
cleavage of Beclin-1 induces the release of cytochrome
C, followed by apoptosis after cells undergo the process
of autophagy. In addition to Beclin-1 cleavage, ATGs
such as ATG5 are also found to be cleaved by caspases in
apoptotic cells [32–34].
P62 is an autophagy-related protein, previous
studies showed that P62 is degraded through autophagy
[20, 35]. Recent reports demonstrated that p62 provided
a signal-organizing interface to recruit poly-ubiquitinated
caspase-8 and subsequently allow its full activation.
When treated with reagents that induced ER stress or
proteaosome inhibition, the cells could activate the
apoptosis system directly through caspase-8, without
the involvement of death receptor signaling [36]. This
novel mechanism of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis was
dependent on the autophagy-related proteins LC3 and p62
[37, 38]. Thus, in addition to serving as a typical caspase
species in the ‘classic’ extrinsic apoptosis, caspase-8 can
also be activated in a p62-dependent manner and involved
in an alternative endogenous pathway of apoptosis,
especially when induced by various reagents or drugs. Our
results reveal that P62 decreases along with the activation

DISCUSSION
The effect of RSV on cancer cells has mainly focused
on antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic effects through
cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and sensitization
to chemotherapy- induced apoptosis [25]. Recently, more
and more research demonstrates that RSV also induces
autophagy in different cells [9, 25]. However, the actual
signaling pathways mediated by RSV to induce cell death
remain elusive. Our previous study found that RSV induced
autophagy in A549 cells through the Ca2+-AMPK-mTOR

treated with 50 μM RSV for up to 96 h, then cells were harvested and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. (B) Co-localization
of Fas and Cav-1 following RSV treatment, showing the interaction and expression level of the two proteins. Cells were stained with antiFas, anti-Cav-1, and DAPI, and then captured by microscopy after treatment with 50 μM RSV for the indicated times. (C) Fas/Cav-1 coimmunoprecipitated following RSV treatment. Cells were exposed to 50 μM RSV for the indicated times, then harvested, and cell lysates
were used in the co-IP assays with P62 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed with anti-P62, anti-Fas and anti-Cav-1 antibodies. The
purified IgG group (72 h) used as control to the p62 antibody we used. (D) A549 cells were pre-treated with 3-MA (a) or transfected with
P62 siRNA (b), then exposed to 50 μM RSV for the indicated times. Cells were lysed and lysates were used in the co-IP assays with Fas
or Cav-1 antibodies. The interaction between Fas and Cav-1 was determined using the corresponding antibody. (E) Cells were transfected
with or without Cav-1 siRNA and then incubated with 50 μM RSV for the indicated times, then proteins were extracted and analyzed by
western blot. (F) The viability of wild type and Cav-1 knockdown cells was analyzed by MTT assay. Cells were treated with 50 μM RSV in
the presence or absence of autophagy and caspase-8 inhibitors. (G) Cells were co-transfected with Cav-1 and P62 siRNA, incubated with
50 μM RSV for indicated times, then extracted and analyzed by western blot. (H) Viability of wild type and P62, P62 and Cav-1 knockdown

of autophagy, and increases when autophagy is inhibited.
Here we demonstrate that the degradation of p62 triggers
formation of Fas/Cav-1 complexes. As far as we know,
this is the first report to demonstrate the involvement of
P62 in balancing autophagy and apoptosis.
Cav-1, a 22-kDa plasma membrane scaffolding
protein, is critical in the formation of the 50- to 100-nm
flask-shaped invaginated caveolin [19, 39]. Previous
reports demonstrated that Cav-1 regulates caspase
3-mediated apoptotic pathways via down-regulation of
Survivin [40]. and the deletion of Cav-1 confers protective
functions against both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis [41].
The data in our study also confirm that deletion of Cav-1
protects cells from apoptotic death due to an inability to
form a death-inducing complex with Fas [42, 43].
In conclusion, we show that activation of autophagy
facilitates the degradation of P62, enabling the formation
of apoptosis initiating Fas/Cav-1 complexes, followed
by cleavage and activation of caspase-8 to trigger
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 5). Furthermore, caspase8-regulated cleavage of Beclin-1 also plays a fundamental
role in the conversion from autophagic to apoptotic cell
death. Although we demonstrate a novel role for P62 in
regulating Fas and Cav-1 complex formation, a detailed
mechanism is still needs to be elucidated. In particular, p62
has been recently described as a binding partner for many
other proteins to facilitate the autophagosomal degradation
of ubiquitinated proteins. Further experiments examining
the binding sites of P62 and mechanism that regulates the
formation of Fas/Cav-1 complexes are warranted.

Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy

Cell lines and treatments

A549 cells were inoculated on coverslips overnight
and then incubated with different combined chemicals
for the indicated time. Cells were then fixed with 4%
formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 minutes. After
rinsing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS cells
were permeabilized by 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS for 10
minutes, and then blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Coverslips were
incubated with 1:500 corresponding primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C, followed by CY3-labeled anti-rabbit or
FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at
RT in the dark. Slides were washed repeatedly with PBS,
and counterstained with DAPI. Fluorescence was acquired
using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany).

Human non-small cell lung cancer (A549) cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), and cultured in DMEM medium supplemented
with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin at 37°C
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. All experiments
were performed during the exponential phase of cell
growth. After reaching 80% confluence, cells were treated
with RSV as indicated and combined with other chemicals.

Cell proliferation assay
Exponentially growing cells were plated in 96-well
culture plates at a density of 7 × 103 cells/well. After plating
for 12 h, cells were pre-incubated with corresponding
inhibitors for 1 h, then 50 μM RSV was added to the
culture medium, the group with no RSV was used as blank
control. After incubation for the indicated time, 20 μl MTT
(500 μg/ml final concentration) was added to each well,
followed by a 4 h incubation at 37°C, then medium was
removed and 150 μl DMSO added to each well. Absorbance
at 490 nm was read using a Micro-plate Auto-reader
(Labsystem). The percentage of viable cells was calculated
as follows: cell viability (%) = OD treatment / OD control × 100%.

Fluorescence intensity analysis
For quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity,
A549 cells were planted in black 96-well culture plates.
After cells reached to 80% confluence, cells were treated
for the indicated time and dose of RSV, stained with
fluorescent dye and then analyzed with a Multiskan
Spectrum (Molecular Devices, SpectraMax M2e 200100) at an excitation wavelength of 507 nm and emission
wavelength of 529 nm for Rho123, excitation wavelength
490 nm and emission wavelength 516 nm for MitoTracker
Green.

Measurement of caspase-3 activity

Co-immunoprecipitation assay

Caspase-3 activity was determined using a
commercially available caspase-3 assay kit (Sigma)
as described by the manufacturers. Briefly, after lysis,
the Bradford method was used to determine protein
concentration. Supernatants were incubated with 2 mM
caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA) at 37°C for 1 h,
and then the absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A549 cells were either transfected with siP62 or
siControl for 24 h, and then treated with 50 μM RSV
for the indicated time. Cells were harvested and lysed
in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1%

sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM
aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin) for 30 minutes. Total
cell extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at
4°C. To immunoprecipitate endogenous Fas and Cav-1, 1
mg of the total lysate was incubated at 4°C with 2 μg of
corresponding antibodies and 50 μl Dynabeads® protein G
(Invitrogen, Oslo, Norway). The immune complexes were
then washed three times with PBS and followed by lysis
buffer. Samples were heated in SDS sample buffer and
processed by western blotting.

Data was normalized to GAPDH transcript levels using
5′- GGCCTCCAAGGAGTAAGACC-3′ (sense) and
5′-AGGGGAGATTCAGTGTGGTG-3′
(antisense)
primers. Expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt
method.

Subcellular fractionation
Mitochondrial and cytosolic subcellular fractions
were isolated by cell disruption followed by differential
centrifugation and washing, as described in the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, lysis homogenates
were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and
supernatants were then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15
min at 4°C. Pellets contained the enriched mitochondrial
fraction, whereas supernatants contained the cytoplasmic/
microsomal fraction, equal amounts of proteins were
analyzed by western blotting and then probed with the
indicated antibodies.

Flow cytometric analysis
For assessment of apoptosis, an Annexin V-PI
staining kit (Santa Cruz) was used according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were pre-treated
with or without inhibitors for 1 hour, followed by
treatment with 50 μM RSV for the indicated times. Both
floating and adherent cells (removed by trypsinization)
were collected. Cells were resuspended in PBS three
times, followed by the addition of annexin V-FITC and PI
to the binding buffer. Samples were then analyzed by flow
cytometry. FITC and PI signals were detected at 518 nm
with FL1 and at 620 nm with FL2, respectively. The log
fluorescence values of annexin V-FITC and PI are shown
on the X and Y axis, respectively.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times
independently. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D (standard
deviation) and analyzed with SPSS 13.0 statistical
software (SPSS Inc.). The immunofluorescence intensity
was analyzed with Image J software (NIH), and the optical
density was measured with Quantity One software (BioRad). The difference between each group was analyzed
with the Dennett t-test and P < 0.05 was considered as
statistically significant.

Western blotting analysis
A549 cells were incubated with the indicated drugs
and times, cells were harvested, washed with PBS and
lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer for 30 minutes. For
western blot analysis after protein quantification with
a BCA assay kit, 50 μg of denatured protein samples
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with the
corresponding antibodies as indicated at 4°C overnight,
followed by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. The transferred proteins were visualized with
a SuperSignal West Dura detection kit (Pierce, Rockford,
USA) and exposed to Medical Blue X-ray film. All
samples were normalized to β-actin.
