Abstract
The anti-ErbB2 antibody trastuzumab has shown signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁts in metastatic breast cancer.
However, resistance to trastuzumab is common. Heterodimerization between ErbB2 and other ErbBs may
redundantly trigger cell proliferation signals and confer trastuzumab resistance. Here, we developed a bispeciﬁc
anti-ErbB2 antibody using trastuzumab and pertuzumab, another ErbB2-speciﬁc humanized antibody that binds
to a distinct epitope from trastuzumab. This bispeciﬁc antibody, denoted as TPL, retained the full binding
activities of both parental antibodies and exhibited pharmacokinetic properties similar to those of a conventional
immunoglobulin G molecule. Unexpectedly, TPL showed superior ErbB2 heterodimerization-blocking activity
over the combination of both parental monoclonal antibodies, possibly through steric hindrance and/or inducing
ErbB2 conformational change. Further data indicated that TPL potently abrogated ErbB2 signaling in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines. In addition, we showed that TPL was far more effective than trastuzumab
plus pertuzumab in inhibiting the growth of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines, both in vitro and in
vivo. Importantly, TPL treatment eradicated established trastuzumab-resistant tumors in tumor-bearing nude
mice. Our results suggest that trastuzumab-resistant breast tumors remain dependent on ErbB2 signaling and
that comprehensive blockade of ErbB2 heterodimerization may be an effective therapeutic avenue. The unique
potential of TPL to overcome trastuzumab resistance warrants its consideration as a promising treatment in the
clinic. Cancer Res; 73(21); 6471–83. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Overexpression of HER2 (or ErbB2), a member of the ErbB
family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is found in 25% to 30% of
human breast cancers (1, 2). Trastuzumab, a humanized
monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against ErbB2, is the
ﬁrst anti-ErbB2 treatment approved for clinical use for patients
with ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (3). The
use of trastuzumab has led to signiﬁcant improvements in

survival in ErbB2-positive breast cancer (4–8). However, many
patients still do not respond to trastuzumab treatment (de
novo resistance; ref. 8), and the majority of trastuzumabresponsive patients develop resistance within 1 year of treatment initiation (acquired resistance; refs. 9, 10). Novel therapeutic approaches are, therefore, needed to overcome de novo
and acquired resistance to trastuzumab therapy.
The mechanism of trastuzumab resistance is not well
understood at the moment, but cross-talk between different
ErbB family receptors is believed to be associated with resistance to trastuzumab therapy (10–12). Although no speciﬁc
ligand for ErbB2 has been identiﬁed, it is the preferred heterodimerization partner of the ErbB family (13). ErbB2 forms
heterodimers with both ligand-free and ligand-bound forms of
the other three ErbB family members (EGFR, ErbB3, and
ErbB4), which activates ErbB receptors and downstream
MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, thereby promoting cell
proliferation and survival (3, 14–19). Previous studies have
shown that trastuzumab only partially inhibits ErbB2-containing heterodimer formation (16, 19, 20). Thus, ErbB2 heterodimerization may still initiate signaling events that confer
resistance when ErbB2 is inhibited by trastuzumab (11, 12).
Pertuzumab is another ErbB2-speciﬁc humanized antibody
that binds to a distinct epitope from trastuzumab (21–23).
Pertuzumab efﬁciently inhibited ErbB2–ErbB3 complex

formation when cells were stimulated with ErbB3 ligand (20).
In contrast, trastuzumab had little effect on ligand-mediated
ErbB2/ErbB3 association (20). Interestingly, in the absence of
ErbB3 ligand, the abilities of these two antibodies to inhibit
ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer formation were reversed: the
amount of ErbB3 associating with ErbB2 was clearly reduced
when cells were treated with trastuzumab, whereas pertuzumab only caused a minor decrease in ErbB3 in complex
with ErbB2 (16). The combination of these two anti-ErbB2
antibodies that have complementary mechanisms of action
synergistically inhibits the in vitro and in vivo growth of
ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (24, 25). In a
phase II study, the activity of combination treatment with
pertuzumab and trastuzumab was investigated in patients
with ErbB2-positive breast cancer with documented progression on trastuzumab as prior therapy (26). The clinical
data showed that combination therapy was well tolerated
and the clinical beneﬁt rate (CBR) was 50% (26). Another
clinical study was designed to further evaluate whether the
encouraging activity observed with the combination of
pertuzumab and trastuzumab actually required the presence
of trastuzumab (27). The results indicated that pertuzumab
monotherapy showed modest efﬁcacy in patients with
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had experienced progression during earlier trastuzumab-based therapy, with a CBR of 10.3% (27). In comparison, after reintroduction of trastuzumab, the combination of pertuzumab
and trastuzumab showed much greater activity than pertuzumab alone, with a CBR of 41.2% (27). These studies suggest
that ErbB2 remains a valid therapeutic target even after
cancers have progressed on multiple ErbB2-directed therapies and that comprehensive blockade of ErbB2 heterodimerization may overcome trastuzumab resistance.
Despite the effectiveness of trastuzumab and pertuzumab
combination therapy in patients with ErbB2-positive breast
cancer whose disease progressed after prior trastuzumab-based
therapy, the objective response rate is only 24.2%, and less than
8% of patients experience a complete response (26). Thus, there
is still an urgent need to improve ErbB2-directed therapy. Here,
we report a bispeciﬁc anti-ErbB2 antibody that exhibits superior
efﬁcacy over the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and animals
The human breast cancer cell lines BT-474, SK-BR-3, HCC1954, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7 and the Chinese
hamster ovary cell line CHO-K1 were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. All the cell lines were
authenticated twice by morphologic and isoenzyme analyses
during the study period. Cell lines were routinely checked for
contamination by Mycoplasma using Hoechst staining and
consistently found to be negative. Six-week-old female BALB/c
mice and 5-week-old female BALB/c nude mice were obtained
from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center of Chinese
Academy of Sciences. All animals were treated in accordance
with guidelines of the Committee on Animals of the Second
Military Medical University.

Construction, expression, and puriﬁcation
The extracellular domain of ErbB2 (ErbB2-ECD) was prepared as described previously (23), except that we used the
pcDNA3.1(þ)-expressing vector (Invitrogen) and the FreeStyle
293 expression system (Invitrogen). Trastuzumab was purchased from Roche Ltd. The pertuzumab antibody (21) was
expressed and puriﬁed using the method described in our
previous studies (28, 29). Recently, Wu and colleagues
described a new approach for producing bispeciﬁc tetravalent
antibody that exhibits excellent, immunoglobulin G (IgG)-like
physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties (30). The
bispeciﬁc tetravalent antibody can be efﬁciently produced by
conventional mammalian expression systems as a single species for easy manufacturing and puriﬁcation (30). Here, we
used this approach to construct monospeciﬁc or bispeciﬁc
tetravalent antibodies. Brieﬂy, the VH and VL of the antibody X
were respectively fused in frame to the 50 terminus of the heavy
chain and light chain of the antibody Y via short (or long)
linkers, which were respectively selected from the N termini of
human CH1 and Ck, where X and Y represent either trastuzumab (31) or pertuzumab (21). The sequences of the short
linkers (SL) are AST (between the two VH) and TVA (between
the two VL). The long linker (LL) sequences are ASTKGPSVF
(between the two VH) and TVAAPSVFI (between the two VL).
We generated six tetravalent antibodies: TPS (Vtrastuzumab-SLVpertuzumab-constant), TPL (Vtrastuzumab-LL-Vpertuzumab-constant), PTS (Vpertuzumab-SL-Vtrastuzumab-constant), PTL
(Vpertuzumab-LL-Vtrastuzumab-constant), TTL (Vtrastuzumab-LLVtrastuzumab-constant), and PPL (Vpertuzumab-LL-Vpertuzumabconstant). The resultant heavy-chain and light-chain genes for
the tetravalent antibody were respectively cloned into the
pcDNA3.1(þ) vector (Invitrogen), yielding the heavy-chain and
light-chain expression vectors. The tetravalent antibody was
expressed and puriﬁed using a similar method as described in
our previous report (28). Brieﬂy, the heavy-chain and lightchain expression vectors were cotransfected into CHO-K1
cells. After transfection, the stable transfectants were isolated
by limiting dilution in the presence of G418 (500 mg/mL). The
cell clone producing the highest amount of antibodies was
grown in serum-free medium. Finally, the recombinant antibody was puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography on Protein ASepharose (GE Healthcare). The puriﬁed antibodies were
analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and
on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by
Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.
Competitive binding assay
Cells at 1  106 cells/mL were incubated with a subsaturating concentration of the indicated Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
anti-ErbB2 mAbs and increasing concentrations of puriﬁed
competing antibodies for 1 hour at 4 C. Then, the cells were
washed and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using a FACScan ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The IC50 values of competitors
were calculated using a four-variable algorithm.
Afﬁnity measurement
The afﬁnities of anti-ErbB2 antibodies for ErbB2-ECD were
determined as described previously (31, 32). Brieﬂy, each mAb

was incubated with increasing concentrations of ErbB2-ECD
for an hour. The concentration of free antibody was then
measured by ELISA using immobilized ErbB2-ECD and was
used to calculate afﬁnity (Kd).
Pharmacokinetics
Groups of 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected
with 5 mg/kg body weight of anti-ErbB2 mAb via the tail vein.
Blood samples were taken every day by retro-orbital bleeding
and collected in tubes coated with heparin to prevent clotting.
Four mice were used for every time point, and each mouse was
bled only once. After centrifugation to remove the cells, the
plasma samples were stored at 80 C until analysis. Serum
concentrations of anti-ErbB2 mAbs were measured by competitive ELISAs. Brieﬂy, serial dilutions of serum samples were
incubated with a subsaturating concentration of trastuzumab–biotin or pertuzumab–biotin on ErbB2–ECD-coated
ELISA plates at 37 C for 1 hour. Detection was carried out
with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental
analysis.
Immunoprecipitation
The association of ErbB2 with ErbB3 cannot be detected
using standard immunoprecipitation methods in the absence of ligand stimulation. To detect ligand-independent
ErbB3/ErbB2 heterodimer, Junttila and colleagues (16) used
a reversible chemical cross-linking procedure with 3,30 dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP). This reagent
cross-links extracellular proteins through amino groups. Even
weakly interacting protein complexes can then be coimmunoprecipitated by using this reagent (16). In this study, we
detected the ligand-independent ErbB2-containing heterodimers using the reversible chemical cross-linking procedure
described by Junttila and colleagues (16), with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, cells were incubated with the indicated
antibodies for 1 hour at 37 C. After washing twice with icecold HEPES/NaCl buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.2, 150
mmol/L NaCl), the cells were incubated with 2 mmol/L DTSSP
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) dissolved in HEPES/NaCl buffer for 1 hour
at 4 C. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold 25
mmol/L Tris (pH 7.1), 150 mmol/L NaCl and lysed in NP-40
lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. For the determination of the expression levels of
EGF receptor (EGFR) and ErbB3 in cell lysates, total cell
lyastes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with
antibodies against EGFR (sc-03; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and ErbB3 (sc-285; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we incubated the total cell
lysate with an agarose-conjugated anti-ErbB2 monoclonal
antibody (sc-7301 AC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight
at 4 C. The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE
followed by Western blot analysis with antibodies speciﬁc for
EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB3 (sc-285; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
The formation of ligand-induced ErbB2-containing heterodimers was assayed by the method described previously (20),
with slight modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, the cells were starved overnight in growth medium without serum and then incubated

with the indicated antibodies for 1 hour at 37 C. Recombinant
human EGF (R&D Systems) and HRG (R&D Systems) were
added at a ﬁnal concentration of 5 and 1 nmol/L, respectively.
EGF is a ligand for EGFR and HRG is a ligand for ErbB3 and
ErbB4. After an additional 10-minute incubation, the cells were
washed three times and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer. For the
determination of the expression levels of EGFR and ErbB3 in
cell lysates, total cell lyastes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with antibodies against EGFR (sc-03; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and ErbB3. For coimmunoprecipitation
experiments, we incubated the total cell lysate with an agaroseconjugated anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 C.
The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with antibodies speciﬁc for
EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB3.
Immunoblotting
Cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies in serumfree medium for 1 hour at 37 C. The cells were then treated
with EGF (5 nmol/L) or HRG (1 nmol/L) or not treated for 15
minutes. After washing, the cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer
and the cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against EGFR, phospho-EGFR-Tyr1068,
phospho-ErbB2-Tyr1221/1222, phospho-ErbB3-Tyr1289, AKT,
phospho-AKT-Ser473, p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p44/42 MAPKThr202/Tyr204 (2236, 2243, 4791, 9272, 4060, 9102, and 9106
respectively, all from Cell Signaling Technology), ErbB2, and
ErbB3.
siRNA transfection
Cells were transfected with 100 pmol siRNA using DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon). Sequences for
interfering RNAs were: 50 -CTA CTT GGA GGA CCG TCG C30 (EGFR); 50 -GAT CTT TGG GAG CCT GGC A-30 (ErbB2); 50 ACC ACG GTA TCT GGT CAT AAA-30 (ErbB3).
Cell proliferation assay
Cells were incubated with different concentrations of
recombinant anti-ErbB2 mAbs for 2 hours, followed by the
addition of ErbB ligands or not. Recombinant human EGF and
HRG were added at a ﬁnal concentration of 5 and 1 nmol/L,
respectively. After an additional 4-day incubation, cell proliferation was determined by CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution
Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS assay) Kit (Promega).
In vivo therapy study
For HCC-1954, MDA-MB-231, or MCF-7 xenograft studies,
3  106 HCC-1954, MDA-MB-231, or MCF-7 cells were inoculated into the mammary fat pad of female BALB/c nude mice.
For BT-474 or BT-474-TraR xenograft studies, female BALB/c
nude mice were implanted with 0.72 mg 60-day release 17bestradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America). After 6 days,
1  107 BT-474 or BT-474-TraR cells were injected into the
mammary fat pad in a 1:1 PBS:Matrigel suspension (BD Matrigel; BD Biosciences). When tumor volumes reached an average
of approximately 100 mm3, the mice were randomly divided
into groups of 10 mice each. Treatments consisted of twice
weekly intravenous injection of different anti-ErbB2 mAbs for 4

Results
Characterization of anti-ErbB2 bispeciﬁc antibodies
We engineered two monospeciﬁc tetravalent antibodies
(TTL and PPL) and four bispeciﬁc tetravalent antibodies (TPS,
TPL, PTS, and PTL) using trastuzumab and pertuzumab
(Fig. 1A). The molecular weights of these recombinant antiErbB2 mAbs were determined by SDS-PAGE. Under reducing
conditions, each of the six tetravalent antibodies (TPS, TPL, PTS
, PTL TTL, and PPL) yielded two protein bands with a molecular
mass of approximately 65 kDa (heavy chain) and approximately 35 kDa (light chain), respectively (Fig. 1B). The SDS-PAGE
analysis under nonreducing conditions showed a single band
at approximately 200 kDa for each of the six tetravalent
antibodies (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that these tetravalent antibodies are IgG-like molecules, which are composed of
two heavy chains and two light chains, held together by
disulﬁde bonds. Competitive binding assays were conducted
to examine the relative binding afﬁnity of TPS, TPL, PTS, or PTL
for the trastuzumab epitope on ErbB2 and the pertuzumab
epitope on ErbB2. The results showed that out of the four
bispeciﬁc antibodies, only TPL retained the full binding activities of both parental antibodies (Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Fig. S1). The relative binding afﬁnity (mean IC50  SD) of TPL
for the trastuzumab epitope was similar to that of trastuzumab
(Supplementary Table S1) and the relative binding afﬁnity of
TPL for the pertuzumab epitope was similar to that of pertuzumab (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, we selected TPL
for further investigation. The afﬁnity constant (Kd) of TPL for
the extracellular domain of ErbB2 (ErbB2-ECD) was determined by an ELISA. The data shown in Supplementary Table S3
indicated that TPL had an ErbB2-bindng afﬁnity comparable
with that of trastuzumab and much higher than that of

pertuzumab. Moreover, the afﬁnity constant (Kd) of TTL or PPL
for ErbB2-ECD was measured and the results showed that
these two monospeciﬁc tetravalent antibodies had binding
afﬁnities similar to those of their respective parental antibodies (Supplementary Table S3).
The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, TTL,
PPL, and TPL were determined after single-dose intravenous
administration to mice. The serum concentrations of these
anti-ErbB2 mAbs were measured by competitive ELISA in
which they competed with biotin-conjugated trastuzumab
(trastuzumab–biotin) and/or biotin-conjugated pertuzumab
(pertuzumab–biotin) for binding to ErbB2-ECD immobilized
on ELISA plates. As summarized in Supplementary Table S4,
the main pharmacokinetic parameters of TTL and PPL in mice
were very close to those of their respective parental mAbs,
trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The serum concentrations of
TPL were determined by both trastuzumab–biotin-based and
pertuzumab–biotin-based competitive ELISAs. The pharmacokinetic parameters calculated based on the two different

competitive ELISA methods were very similar (Supplementary
Table S4), indicating that the TPL molecule was intact and
capable of binding both the trastuzumab epitope and the
pertuzumab epitope in the presence of serum. The data presented in Supplementary Table S4 also showed that TPL had
pharmacokinetic properties similar to those of a conventional
IgG molecule, suggesting that it is highly stable in vivo.
TPL blocks ErbB2 heterodimerization more effectively
than the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab
The expression of ErbB receptors in human breast cancer
cell lines used in this study was determined and shown in
Supplementary Table S5. BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cell lines were
trastuzumab-sensitive, and HCC-1954, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were de novo resistant to trastuzumab (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined the capability of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, TTL, PPL,
TTL plus PPL, and TPL to disrupt ErbB2 heterodimerization in
BT-474 and MCF-7 cell lines. In both cell lines, trastuzumab

was more effective than pertuzumab in disrupting ligandindependent ErbB2/ErbB3 association (Fig. 2B). The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab caused a marked
decrease in the amount of ligand-independent ErbB2/ErbB3
complex compared with either mAb alone (Fig. 2B). Both
trastuzumab and pertuzumab were effective in inhibiting
EGF-stimulated ErbB2/EGFR dimerization, although pertuzumab exhibited a stronger effect (Fig. 2C). However, only
pertuzumab, but not trastuzumab, was able to disrupt HRGmediated ErbB2/ErbB3 complex formation (Fig. 2C). The
addition of trastuzumab to pertuzumab led to a decrease in
EGF-induced ErbB2/EGFR heterodimer but not in HRGinduced ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer compared with pertuzumab alone (Fig. 2C). TTL and PPL, either alone or in combination, was as effective as the parental mAbs, trastuzumab and
pertuzumab (Fig. 2B and C). Remarkably, TPL was far more
potent in blocking both ligand-independent and ligandinduced ErbB2 heterodimerization than all other anti-ErbB2
mAbs and mAb combinations tested (Fig. 2B and C). More
strikingly, the amount of ligand-independent ErbB2/EGFR
heterodimer was markedly reduced only when cells were
treated with TPL (Fig. 2B).
TPL potently inhibits ErbB2 signaling in both
trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer
cell lines
We examined the inhibitory effects of anti-ErbB2 mAb
treatment on the activation of ErbB2 and downstream MAPK
and AKT signaling pathways. Our results indicated that the
ability of anti-ErbB2 mAbs to inhibit ErbB2 signaling corresponded with their capacity to block ErbB2 heterodimerization
(Figs. 2 and 3). In the absence of ligand stimulation, treatment
of trastuzumab-sensitive BT474 cells with either trastuzumab
or pertuzumab caused a decrease in ErbB3, MAPK and AKT
phosphorylation, but trastuzumab showed a much stronger
effect (Fig. 3A). The addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab
further reduced the phosphorylation of ErbB3, MAPK, and AKT
(Fig. 3A). Notably, TPL inhibited the phosphorylation of ErbB3,
MAPK, and AKT far more effectively than did all other antiErbB2 mAbs and mAb combinations tested (Fig. 3A). It is
particularly noteworthy that signiﬁcant dephosphorylation of
EGFR was observed only when cells were treated with TPL (Fig.
3A). Moreover, in trastuzumab-resistant MDA-MB-231 and
HCC-1954 cell lines, only TPL treatment effectively inhibited
ligand-independent ErbB2 signaling, whereas all other treatments had only a very minor effect (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Fig. S2A).
We next sought to determine the ability of TPL to block
ligand-induced ErbB2 signaling. The results showed that the
phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, and MAPK was dramatically
increased in BT-474 cells after EGF stimulation and this
activation could be signiﬁcantly inhibited by pretreatment
with both trastuzumab and pertuzumab, although pertuzumab appeared to be a more potent inhibitor (Fig. 3C). We also
showed that the phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3, MAPK, and
AKT was substantially enhanced after HRG treatment in BT474 cells (Fig. 3C). Pertuzumab effectively inhibited the HRGinduced enhancement of ErbB2, ErbB3, MAPK, and AKT

phosphorylation, whereas trastuzumab had no effect (Fig.
3C). The combination of trastuzumab with pertuzumab
resulted in a marked reduction in EGF-induced, but not in
HRG-induced, ErbB activation when compared with pertuzumab alone (Fig. 3C). Of note, TPL showed the most potent
inhibitory effect, almost completely abrogating ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, MAPK, and AKT
in BT-474 cells (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with
trastuzumab-resistant HCC-1954, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB231, and MCF-7 cell lines (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S2B).
TPL-Fab is as effective as TPL in inhibiting ErbB2
heterodimerization and signaling in breast cancer cell
lines
To determine whether TPL must be tetravalent to prevent
ErbB2 heterodimerization and block ErbB2 activation, we
assessed the properties of a Fab version of TPL–TPL-Fab (Fig.
4A). TPL-Fab, which is bivalent and bispeciﬁc, was obtained by
papain digestion of TPL and puriﬁed as described previously
(33). In the absence of ErbB ligand stimulation, TPL-Fab was as
effective as TPL in disrupting the association of ErbB2 with
either EGFR or ErbB3 (Fig. 4B). Both TPL and its Fab version
almost completely blocked the formation of EGF-mediated
ErbB2/EGFR heterodimer and HRG-induced ErbB2/ErbB3
heterodimer (Fig. 4C). Likewise, TPL-Fab showed a similar
ability as TPL to inhibit both ligand-independent and
ligand-induced phosphorylation of MAPK and AKT (Fig. 4D
and E). We next compared the effects of TPL and its Fab version
on breast cancer cell proliferation. The results indicated that in
the absence or present of ErbB ligand, TPL and TPL-Fab were
equally potent in suppressing the proliferation of both BT-474
and MCF-7 cell lines (Fig. 4F). Together, these data suggest that
the ability of TPL to block ErbB2 heterodimerization and
signaling is independent of tetravalency.
TPL has superior in vitro antitumor activity compared
with the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab
We evaluated the ability of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, TTL, PPL, TTL plus PPL, and TPL to
inhibit the in vitro proliferation of trastuzumab-sensitive (BT474 and SK-BR-3) and trastuzumab-resistant (HCC-1954, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468) breast cancer cell lines.
Our data clearly indicated that the antiproliferative activity of
these anti-ErbB2 mAbs was directly related to their ability to
block ErbB2 heterodimerization and signaling (Fig. 5A). Notably, trastuzumab was much more effective than pertuzumab in
suppressing breast cancer cell proliferation in the absence of
ErbB ligand (Fig. 5A). In contrast, pertuzumab exhibited a
greater antiproliferative activity than trastuzumab against
HRG- and EGF-stimulated cell lines (Fig. 5A). The inhibitory
effects of TTL and PPL, either alone or in combination, were
similar to those of trastuzumab and pertuzumab (Fig. 5A).
Remarkably, TPL showed far greater antiproliferative activity
than that of any of the others both in the absence and presence
of ErbB ligand (Fig. 5A). To rule out potential off-target activity
of TPL, we examined the effects of ErbB2 RNAi knockdown on
MAPK/AKT pathways and growth in the low-ErbB2–expressing cell line MDA-MB-231. Our data showed that knockdown

of ErbB2 effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of MAPK
and AKT (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and resulted in growth
inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Therefore, it can be
concluded that the antitumor activity of TPL is associated
with an ErbB2-dependent mechanism.

MCF-7 tumor progression (Fig. 5B). Both trastuzumab and
pertuzumab did not inhibit the HCC-1954 tumor growth (Fig.

inhibition of the BT-474 and HCC-1954 tumors than either of
these mAbs alone (Fig. 5B). However, combinatorial treatment
with these two mAbs did not result in a signiﬁcant beneﬁt over

MCF-7 xenograft mouse models (Fig. 5B). The antitumor
activity of TTL plus PPL was similar to that of trastuzumab
plus pertuzumab (Fig. 5B). Notably, TPL inhibited tumor
growth much more effectively than the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in all four tumor models (Fig. 5B).
Importantly, TPL treatment resulted in complete regression of
all BT-474, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 tumors and 40% of HCC1954 tumors, whereas no tumor eradication was observed in
tumor-bearing mice treated with all other anti-ErbB2 antibodies. Moreover, our data also indicated that TPL inhibited
breast cancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner both
in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S4).
TPL overcomes acquired resistance to trastuzumab
We modeled the development of acquired resistance in
patients by treating BT474 and SK-BR-3 cell lines with 10
mg/mL of trastuzumab for 9 months to obtain the trastuzumab-resistant (TraR) sublines, BT-474TraR and SK-BR-3TraR.
The TraR sublines were signiﬁcantly more resistant to trastu-

zumab treatment than the parental cell lines both in vitro and
in vivo (Fig. 6A and B). In addition, we found that the amount of
EGFR and EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers was dramatically
enhanced in the TraR cells compared with the parental cells
(Fig. 6C and D). Consistent with this, the TraR cells showed a
marked increase in EGFR and MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 6C).
In addition, the TraR cells expressed higher levels of ErbB
ligands (EGF, HRG, and BTC) than did the parental cells (Fig.
6E). These data indicate that overexpression of EGFR and
ligands for EGFR and ErbB3 may be associated with trastuzumab-resistant phenotypes. Next, we examined the effect of
siRNA knockdown of EGFR or ErbB3 on the BT-474TraR cell
line. Transfection of EGFR siRNA and ErbB3 siRNA dramatically downregulated the amount of EGFR and ErbB3 in BT474TraR cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B).
Treatment with EGFR siRNA inhibited ligand-independent
EGFR signaling (Supplementary Fig. S5C, left) and considerably
resensitized BT-474TraR cells to trastuzumab treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5D, left). Further data indicated that EGFR

siRNA effectively inhibited EGF-induced EGFR signaling (Supplementary Fig. S5C, middle) and cell growth (Supplementary
Fig. S5D, middle). Our data also showed that treatment with
ErbB3 siRNA resulted in effective inhibition of HRG-mediated
ErbB3 signaling (Supplementary Fig. S5C, right) and cell
growth (Supplementary Fig. S5D, right) in the BT-474TraR cell
line. Together, these data further suggest that enhanced ligandindependent EGFR signaling and ligand-activated ErbB signaling may be acquired trastuzumab resistance mechanisms.
TPL has been shown to be able to block both ligand-independent and ligand-induced ErbB signaling. Next, we asked
whether it could overcome acquired resistance to trastuzumab. As observed in the parental cells, TPL potently inhib-

receptor heterodimerization and signaling in the TraR cells
(Fig. 6F–I). Accordingly, the extent of in vitro growth inhibition by TPL was similar for the parental and TraR cells (Fig.
6A). TPL treatment eradicated established TraR tumors in all
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 6B), whereas trastuzumab treatment failed to lead to signiﬁcant tumor shrinkage. We also
showed that trastuzumab plus pertuzumab was signiﬁcantly
less effective than TPL in inhibiting the in vitro proliferation
of BT-474TraR cells (Fig. 6J). Consistent with this, the in vivo
antitumor activity of the two mAbs in combination was
much lower than that of TPL in the BT-474TraR xenograft
mouse model (Fig. 6K).

An Anti-ErbB2 BsAb Circumvents Trastuzumab Resistance

Discussion
Here, we constructed the bispeciﬁc antibody TPL from
pertuzumab and trastuzumab. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst study to report a bispeciﬁc antibody targeting distinct
ErbB2 epitopes and to show that this bispeciﬁc antibody has
exceptionally potent antitumor activity. The superior heterodimerization-blocking activity of TPL over trastuzumab plus
pertuzumab suggested that, in addition to the regions recognized by trastuzumab and pertuzumab, other regions in ErbB2
might be involved in ErbB2 heterodimerization, and that TPL
might block the interaction of these regions with other ErbBs
through steric hindrance and/or inducing ErbB2 conformational change. The strategy for the generation of a bispeciﬁc
antibody against different epitopes on the same antigen has
been reported by Lu and colleagues, who developed an antiVEGFR-2 bispeciﬁc antibody (34). The extracellular domain of
VEGFR-2 consists of seven Ig-like domains, and VEGF binds to
the second and third Ig-like domains (35). Lu and colleagues
engineered a bispeciﬁc diabody using two anti-VEGFR2 singlechain antibodies (scFvs; ref. 34). One scFv binds to an epitope
that is located on VEGFR-2 domain 1, and the other scFv binds
to an epitope on domains 6 and 7. Neither of the two scFvs
blocks VEGFR-2 from binding to VEGF, or has any effect on
VEGF-induced receptor activation (34). It is rather unexpected
that the bispeciﬁc diabody effectively blocks VEGFR-2–VEGF
interactions, and inhibits both VEGF-induced activation of the
receptor and mitogenesis of human endothelial cells (34). Their
results suggest that this diabody is most likely to exert its
VEGFR-2–VEGF blocking activity by steric hindrance and/or
by causing major conformational changes of VEGFR-2 (34).
Taken together, our results and those of Lu and colleagues
suggest that a bispeciﬁc antibody directed against two different epitopes with the same antigen may exert unique effects
through steric hindrance and/or causing major conformational changes of the antigen.
The mechanism of trastuzumab resistance is not yet fully
elucidated, but compensatory signaling downstream of ErbB2containing heterodimers is believed to play a critical role in
driving trastuzumab resistance (10–12). A deeper understanding of signaling pathways that may still be active in the
presence of trastuzumab and further understanding of ErbB2
heterodimerization will offer unique opportunities to enhance
the sensitivity of antibody-based therapy. Here, we show that
trastuzumab is ineffective at blocking ligand-independent

EGFR–ErbB2 complex formation and ligand-induced ErbB2
heterodimerization. In addition, our results indicate that signaling from ligand-independent ErbB2/EGFR heterodimer and
ligand-mediated ErbB2-containing heterodimers may contribute to resistance to trastuzumab, suggesting that simultaneous
targeting of multiple ErbB2-containing heterodimers may be a
promising therapeutic avenue for patients with trastuzumabresistant tumors.
ErbB2 remains a valid therapeutic target even after cancers
have progressed on multiple ErbB2-directed therapies (26,
27, 36, 37). Thus, for some, most, or all ErbB2-positive cancers,
ErbB2 itself continues to represent a major vulnerability. The
challenge is determining the optimal method to capitalize on
this vulnerability (38). One strategy to overcome trastuzumab
resistance is to continue trastuzumab therapy but while combining it with an alternative chemotherapy regimen. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody–drug conjugate
comprising trastuzumab and DM1, a microtubule polymerization inhibitor (39, 40). In a phase 2 study, T-DM1 monotherapy led to an objective response rate of 34.5% in patients
with ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had
prior treatment with trastuzumab, lapatinib, an anthracycline,
a taxane, and capecitabine (41). Another strategy to overcome
trastuzumab resistance is to combine trastuzumab with
another anti-ErbB2 antibody that has different mechanisms
of action from trastuzumab. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab
mainly interfere with ligand-independent and ligand-induced
ErbB2 heterodimerization, respectively (16, 20). The combination of these two antibodies that have complementary
mechanisms of action is active in patients with ErbB2-positive
breast cancer who had experienced progression during prior
trastuzumab or pertuzumab monotherapy (26, 27). In this
study, TPL has been shown to provide a more comprehensive
blockade of ErbB2 heterodimerization and signaling and result
in greater antitumor activity than trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in trastuzumab-resistant breast tumor models. Thus, it
can be concluded that compared with combinatorial therapy
with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, TPL treatment may lead to
a better therapeutic outcome for patients with ErbB2-positive
breast cancer who do not respond to trastuzumab treatment.
In conclusion, the data shown here suggest that trastuzumab-resistant breast tumors remain dependent on signaling
downstream of ErbB2-containing heterodimers and that
comprehensive blockade of ErbB2 heterodimerization may
