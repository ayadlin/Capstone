ABSTRACT
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) management has undergone a major transformation
over the past decade; immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical
trials and show promising results. However, the effectiveness of immune checkpoint
inhibitors in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) is still limited. Lycorine, an alkaloid
extracted from plants of the Amaryllidaceae family, is touted as a potential anti-cancer
drug because of its demonstrative growth inhibition capacity (induction of cell cycle
arrest and inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry formation). Moreover, T cell checkpoint
blockade therapy with antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein
4 (CTLA-4) has improved outcomes in cancer patients. However, the anti-tumor
efficacy of combined lycorine and anti-CTLA-4 therapy remains unknown. Thus, we
investigated a combination therapy of lycorine hydrochloride and anti-CTLA-4 using
a murine RCC model. As a means of in vitro confirmation, we found that lycorine
hydrochloride inhibited the viability of various RCC cell lines. Furthermore, luciferaseexpressing Renca cells were implanted in the left kidney and the lung of BALB/c mice
to develop a RCC metastatic mouse model. Lycorine hydrochloride and anti-CTLA-4
synergistically decreased tumor weight, lung metastasis, and luciferin-staining in
tumor images. Importantly, the observed anti-tumor effects of this combination were
dependent on significantly suppressing regulatory T cells while upregulating effector T
cells; a decrease in regulatory T cells by 31.43% but an increase in effector T cells by
31.59% were observed in the combination group compared with those in the control
group). We suggest that a combination of lycorine hydrochloride and anti-CTLA-4 is
a viable therapeutic option for RCC patients.

INTRODUCTION

2016, with a prediction that 14,240 people will die from
RCC [1]. Recent studies on anticancer therapy targeting
RCC have mainly focused on inhibitors of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways [2]. Immune checkpoint

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the twelfth most
common cancer in the world. In the United States,
approximately 62,700 new cases were diagnosed in

Lycorine hydrochloride suppressed Renca
migration and invasion

inhibitors, a prominent means of immunotherapy also
known as biologic therapy, have demonstrable clinical
efficacy in a subset of cancer patients [3].
Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4
(CTLA-4) is an essential negative regulator of T cell
responses [4], resulting in T cell exhaustion and hence
a state of T cell dysfunction in many types of cancer
[5]. The blockade of CTLA-4 can promote anti-tumor
T cell immunity [6]. In metastatic melanoma, overall
survival (OS) was improved markedly with ipilimumab,
a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets CTLA-4 and
prevents B-cell activation antigen B7 and thus serving
as an immune checkpoint inhibitor [7]. Nevertheless,
response rates were poor, and adverse events were high,
thus limiting the use of this therapy [8]. To date, only three
clinical trials have assessed this anti-CTLA-4 antibody in
patients with RCC [9–11]. Hence, more effective treatment
strategies are required to improve therapeutic efficacy,
minimizing adverse events, improving response rates, and
application of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Lycorine, a natural alkaloid derived from
Amaryllidaceae plants, inhibits growth of various
cancers, such as prostate cancer [12], multiple myeloma
[13], ovarian cancer [14], lung epithelial cancer [15],
leukemia [16–18], and melanoma [19, 20]. The possible
mechanisms underlying its anticancer effect was attributed
to the induction of cell apoptosis [12, 16, 18] and cell cycle
arrest [13, 14, 17] and inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry
formation [19]. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated
that lycorine was able to sensitize chronic lymphocytic
leukemia cells to treatment in the presence of CD40L [16],
highlighting that lycorine may affect the immune system.
However, lycorine’s anti-tumor effects in RCC have yet
to be determined.
To determine the immunomodulatory potential
of lycorine in RCC, we evaluated anti-tumor effects of
lycorine hydrochloride alone or in combination with antimouse CTLA-4 in an orthotopic and metastatic tumor
mice model.

In order to determine the effects of lycorine
hydrochloride on the motility of Renca cells, the scratch
motility assay was performed. Lycorine hydrochloride
had significant effects on Renca cell migration, with the
highest concentration of lycorine hydrochloride displaying
> 4-fold inhibition in the migration rate compared to the
control group (10% ± 2.83% in the highest concentration
group vs. 73% ± 5.15% in the control group) (Figure 2A
and 2D). Subsequently, we performed migration and
invasion assays to evaluate the migratory aspects of
Renca cells, as shown in Figure 2B and 2C, and lycorine
hydrochloride remarkably repressed the migration and
invasion abilities of Renca cells.
In different dilution groups (0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM), the
cell migration rates were 97.28% ± 0.65%, 72.62% ± 5.13%,
48.49% ± 3.09%, 45.34% ± 2.56% and cell invasion rates
were 67.70% ± 6.18%, 49.21% ± 3.07%, 37.03% ± 5.12%,
and 26.10% ± 3.08%, respectively (Figure 2E and 2F).

Lycorine hydrochloride induced cell cycle arrest
of Renca cells
Flow cytometry was used to profile cell cycle
dynamics, via propidium iodide (PI)/RNase Staining
Buffer, upon treatment with lycorine hydrochloride. As
revealed in Figure 3A, sub-G1 fractions (which represent
the population of apoptotic cells) were markedly elevated
from 1.77% to 49.52% compared with that in the
control, whereas cells with difference dilutions lycorine
hydrochloride treatment. By contrast, the proportions in
G2/M cells decreased from 27.55% to 7.83% compared
with that in the control. Subsequently, we performed
western blot analysis to evaluate the expression of cyclin
D1, cyclin D3, and CDK2 in Renca cells after treatment.
As shown in Figure 3B, the expression level of all three
proteins was significantly decreased as compared with that
in the vehicle-treated group.

RESULTS

Lycorine hydrochloride and anti-mouse CTLA4 combination therapy led to anti-tumor effects
in an orthotopic and metastatic tumor murine
model

Lycorine hydrochloride inhibited RCC cell
viability
We observed that lycorine hydrochloride inhibited
Renca cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1). Additionally,
lycorine hydrochloride inhibited the viability of the
following RCC cell lines: Caki-1, ACHN, KPK-1, and
Renca, as evaluated via an XTT assay. Here, inhibition
was observed in a time-dependent inhibition manner
following treatment with 5 μM lycorine hydrochloride
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figures 1, 2).

To appraise in vivo effects of lycorine hydrochloride
and anti-mouse CTLA-4 combination treatment, mice
were randomly divided into four groups and received
treatment as outlined in the Materials and Methods.
Tumor volumes were detected by the IVIS-200 Imaging
System on day 10 post-treatment (Figure 4A). The photo
flux indices (Figure 4C) were analyzed among groups,

the combination treatment group as compared with other
groups. Moreover, macroscopic images of the orthotopic
and metastatic tumors were captured (Figure 4B) via the
IVIS instrument.

RCC management has undergone a major
transformation over the past decade [21]. Innovative
surgical strategies such as partial nephrectomy can provide
excellent oncological outcomes compared with radical
nephrectomy in localized disease [22]. The European
Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines also recommend
cytoreductive nephrectomy and VEGF- and mTOR-targeted
therapies for patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) [22].
Immunotherapy, agents such as IL-2 (interleukin-2)
and interferon have been used for more than 20 years.
In addition, novel agents, such as immune checkpoint
inhibitors CTLA-4 blockage, PD-1 and PD-L1 blockage,
are currently undergoing clinical trials and show promising
results [23]. Two phase III studies are investigating PD-1,
CTLA-4, and PD-L1 antibodies in combination with
anti-VEGF therapy for patients with mRCC (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02231749,
NCT02420821). Nevertheless, the effectiveness of
immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with mRCC
is very low. Therefore, developing a new therapeutic
strategy with improved effectiveness is of paramount
importance. Lycorine has previously been suggested to
exhibit potential anti-cancer effects [12–19]. Furthermore,
according to the previous study, the activation of
lycorine was associated with the immune system [16].
More recently, we demonstrated that a combination of

Lycorine hydrochloride and anti-mouse CTLA-4
combination therapy suppressed Tregs and
upregulated effector T cells
T-regulatory cells (Tregs) are known to suppress
immune responses towards tumors. The frequency of
CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs was higher in control, tumor bearing
BALB/c mice, accounting for approximately 35% of total
splenocytes, but there was a significant decrease of Tregs in
the combination group as compared with the other treatment
groups (3.70 ± 0.23% in combination group vs. 13.88 ±
0.75% in lycorine hydrochloride group and 10.98 ± 0.38%
in anti-mouse CTLA-4 group) (Figure 5A and 5B). In
addition, the frequency of CD8+ CD44+ CD62L− effector
T cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Intriguingly, we
observed a remarkable upregulation of effector T cells in
the treatment groups: 52.95 ± 3.40% in the combination
group, 42.89 ± 0.49% in the lycorine hydrochloride group,
and 50.15 ± 12.53% in the anti-mouse CTLA-4 group,
respectively, compared to the control group (Figure 6A
and 6B). Furthermore, histopathological examination
indicated no abnormal histological changes in any
treatment group (data not shown).

survivin inhibitor and immunotherapy exhibited a potent
therapeutic effect in RCC [24].
In the current study, we hypothesized that
combining lycorine hydrochloride with emerging
immunotherapeutic agent anti-CTLA-4 mAb could
result in a potentially more effective anticancer strategy.
The inhibition of cell proliferation was measured
using IC50 values (Supplementary Figure 1). We clearly
confirmed the anticancer potential of lycorine hydrochloride
in vitro as we observed time-dependent inhibition in several
RCC cell lines, particularly following treatment with 5 μM
lycorine hydrochloride (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Figure 2), and the Renca cell line was the most sensitive
to the treatment (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1).
Moreover, lycorine hydrochloride suppressed the migratory
and invasive abilities of Renca cells (Figure 2). Previous
studies indicated that there is a strong relationship between
cell cycle arrest and the anticancer effect of lycorine [13,
14, 17, 20, 25, 26].
To further investigate the possible mechanism
underlying the anticancer potential of lycorine
hydrochloride, we discerned its effect on the cell cycle
profile and found that sub-G1 fractions and G2/M DNA
content respectively increased and decreased after treatment
(Figure 3A). Compared with the control group, the sub-G1
phase cell proportion increased by approximately 48.82%
and G2/M cells proportion decreased by 20.13% in the
highest concentration group. The expression of cyclin D1,
cyclin D3, and CDK2 was also significantly decreased
upon lycorine treatment (Figure 3B). A previous study has
demonstrated significant associations between cell cycle
arrest and cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and CDK2 depletion [27],
which may partly explain their anticancer effect in RCC.
We then investigated whether the combination of lycorine
hydrochloride and anti-mouse CTLA-4 would treat RCC
and mRCC, one of the most common malignant tumors.
In our study, when compared to mice treated only with
anti-CTLA-4 or lycorine hydrochloride therapy, mice on
the combination treatment regimen showed significantly
reduced orthotopic and metastatic tumors (Figure 4). In
addition, we observed a synergistic effect of immunological
suppression using this combination treatment strategy,
which may partially explain the robust anti-tumor effects
of this treatment regimen.
Herein, for the first time, we report that lycorine
hydrochloride in combination with anti-mouse CTLA-4
inhibited orthotopic and metastatic tumors by
downregulating Tregs (Figure 5), which was accompanied
with upregulation of effector T cells (Figure 6). Our
findings suggest and indicate lycorine as a potent candidate
for treating RCC. Moreover, our study demonstrated that
lycorine functions partially via immunological activation
as per the observed dynamics of Tregs and effector T cells.
Importantly, we have highlighted the synergistic effect of
immunological suppression in the combination treatment
group, and such insight implies that lycorine may partly

enhance patient immune response rates. In summary,
the effect of combined administration of lycorine
hydrochloride and anti-mouse CTLA-4 exhibited a potent
therapeutic effect in the orthotopic and metastatic RCC
tumor murine model and will serve as an excellent aid for
developing a better treatment strategy for RCC.
However, this study has some limitations, e.g., the
exact molecular target of anticancer effect on RCC has
not yet been identified. Thus, more research needs to
be conducted in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture
Caki-1; ACHN; KPK-1, the human adenocarcinoma
cell lines; and Renca, a murine kidney carcinoma cell
line, were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured
at 37°C and 5% CO2. The cells were maintained in
Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 Medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Animals
BALB/c mice (female, 8 weeks old, 20 ± 2 g) were
purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan)
and used for this study. All mice were bred and housed
in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment at the
Department of Animal Center of Okayama University
(Okayama, Japan). To allow adequate acclimation, mice
were housed in the SPF environment for more than
1 week prior to experimentation. Animals were bred and
handled in accordance with the guidelines of the Okayama
University Animal Research Committee.

Drugs and antibodies
Lycorine hydrochloride (Figure 1A) was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA). The
anti-mouse CTLA-4 (clone 9H10) monoclonal antibody
was purchased from BioXCell (West Lebanon, NH,
USA). Primary antibodies against cyclin D1, cyclin D3,
CDK2, and β-actin were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). Purified  PE rat
anti-mouse CD4, FITC rat anti-mouse Foxp3, APC rat
anti-mouse CD8a, PE rat anti-mouse CD62L, and FITC rat
anti-mouse CD44 were purchased from BD Biosciences,
Inc. (San Jose, CA, USA).

XTT assay
The Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used to assess the effects of
lycorine hydrochloride on cell viability. Briefly, the cell

lines Caki-1; ACHN; KPK-1 and Renca were diluted in
96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) at a density
of 1 × 103 and incubated with medium alone or serial
dilutions of lycorine hydrochloride (0, 0.5, 1, 5, and
10 μM). Cell viability was monitored after 24, 48, 72, and
96 h. For each time point, the XTT labeling reagent and
an electron coupling reagent was added to the culture. The
cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C and 5% CO2, and
absorbance at 450–500 nm, with a reference wavelength at
650 nm, was recorded using a Bio-Rad microplate reader
(Hercules, CA, USA).

were resuspended with propidium iodide (PI)/RNase
Buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). After being
incubated in the dark for 15 min at 4°C, flow cytometric
analyses were performed and analyzed via MACSQuant
Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA).
For in vivo assays, blood samples from mice were
collected into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA). Samples were then incubated with the
appropriate antibody for 1 h at 4°C and washed twice with
PBS. For the intracellular staining of Foxp3, cells were
fixed and permeabilized as previously described [28].
Samples were resuspended in 250 μL of cold PBS and
analyzed using the MACSQuant Analyzer 10.

Scratch motility assay
Renca cell migratory ability was evaluated via the
scratch motility assay. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates
(Costar, Corning, NY, USA) at a density of 3 ×  105 for
24 h. A vertical wound was made with a sterile pipette
tip, followed by washing with PBS two times, and then
incubated with medium alone or serial dilutions of lycorine
hydrochloride (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM) for 24 h at 37°C and
5% CO2. Images of cell migration onto these scratched
zones were captured by the Olympus IX2 microscope
(Olympus, TOKYO, JAPAN). The scratch width was
calculated using the Image Pro Plus 6.0 software. Migration
rate was calculated as (%)  =  [1 −*W (24 h)]/*W (0 h),
where  *W (0 h) and *W (24 h) indicate the width of the
wound at 0 h and 24 h, respectively.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were performed as previously
described [28]. A total of 20 μg of protein was separated
in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PVDF
membranes were incubated with the indicated primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C after being blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk in 1 X TBS-T (0.05 M Tris-buffered
saline with 0.5% Triton X-100). After washed three times
with 1 X TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxide secondary
antibodies, and protein abundance was assessed via
exposing the membranes to X-ray film after incubation
with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL kit;
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Chandler, AZ, USA).

Migration and invasion assays
For the migration assay, Renca cells were plated
in six-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 and incubated
with medium alone or serial dilutions of lycorine
hydrochloride (0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM) for 24 h. Renca
cells were resuspended in serum-free medium and seeded
into trans-well chambers with 8-μm diameter pore size
polycarbonate membranes (Corning, NY, USA). Medium
containing 30% fetal bovine serum was used in the
lower chamber as an attractant. For the invasion assay,
trans-well chambers were coated with Corning Matrigel
Matrix (Corning, NY, USA). After 12 h, cells on the
upper chamber surface were removed using cotton swabs.
The migrated or invaded cells in the lower surface were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1%
crystal violet. The total numbers of cells were captured
and analyzed from 10 different fields with the Olympus
IX2 microscope.

Bioluminescent imaging of tumors in live mice
Luciferase-expressing tumors were detected by
IVIS-200 Imaging System (Xenogen Corporation,
Alameda, CA, USA). Briefly, mice were injected by
intraperitoneally (IP) with D-luciferin (150 mg/kg,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) after being
anesthetized. Images were acquired with the IVIS-200
Imaging System at appropriate exposure times, the
imaging and quantification of signals were analyzed
by the Living Image software with proper background
subtraction.

In vivo lycorine hydrochloride and anti-mouse
CTLA-4 combination treatment
For our in vivo therapeutic experiments, Renca-Luc
cells were inoculated into the sub-renal capsule kidney
(3 × 105 cells in 50 µl PBS) and tail vein (2 × 105 cells
in 30 µl PBS) of C57BL/6 mice to produce an orthotopic
tumor and metastatic lung tumors. Mice were randomly
divided into four groups: PBS (control), lycorine
hydrochloride, anti-mouse CTLA-4, and the combination
(lycorine hydrochloride plus anti-mouse CTLA-4), a

For in vitro assays, Renca cells were plated onto
6-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 and incubated with
medium alone or serial dilutions of lycorine hydrochloride.
Cells were washed with PBS after 12 h, fixed with 75%
ethanol, and further incubated at 4°C for 2 h. Then, cells

captured by the IVIS-200 Imaging System. Briefly, mice
received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 200 μL of
PBS as a vehicle control, lycorine hydrochloride (5 mg/kg
per day for a week) and/or anti-mouse CTLA-4 (100 µg/
mouse on day 0 and 7 of treatment). The bioluminescent
imaging and tumor volume was analyzed on day 10 posttreatment. Mice were then sacrificed, and the macroscopic
images of orthotopic and metastatic tumors were detected.
