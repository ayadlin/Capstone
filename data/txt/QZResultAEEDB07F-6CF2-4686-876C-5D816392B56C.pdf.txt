Abstract
Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNA), an abundant class
of small nonprotein-coding RNAs that mostly function as negative regulators of protein-coding gene expression, is common in cancer. Here, we analyze the regulation of miRNA
expression in response to estrogen, a steroid hormone that
is involved in the development and progression of breast carcinomas and that is acting via the estrogen receptors (ER)
transcription factors. We set out to thoroughly describe miRNA expression, by using miRNA microarrays and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments, in various
breast tumor cell lines in which estrogen signaling has been
induced by 17β-estradiol (E2). We show that the expression
of a broad set of miRNAs decreases following E2 treatment
in an ER-dependent manner. We further show that enforced
expression of several of the repressed miRNAs reduces E2dependent cell growth, thus linking expression of specific miRNAs with estrogen-dependent cellular response. In addition, a
transcriptome analysis revealed that the E2-repressed miR-26a
and miR-181a regulate many genes associated with cell growth
and proliferation, including the progesterone receptor gene, a
key actor in estrogen signaling. Strikingly, miRNA expression
is also regulated in breast cancers of women who had received
antiestrogen neoadjuvant therapy. Overall, our data indicate
that the extensive alterations in miRNA regulation upon estrogen signaling pathway play a key role in estrogen-dependent
functions and highlight the utility of considering miRNA
expression in the understanding of antiestrogen resistance
of breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(21):8332–40]

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small noncoding RNAs for
which functions in regulating gene expression at the posttranscriptional level is now established in multicellular eukaryotes. These
small (18–24 nucleotides in length) RNA molecules regulate numerous biological processes. The base-pairing interactions between miRNAs and their target mRNAs, often within the 3′
untranslated regions (UTR) of target genes, results in degradation

and/or translation inhibition of the target mRNAs (1, 2). miRNA,
generally transcribed by RNA polymerase II, are initially made as
large RNA precursors, called pri-miRNAs (3). Transcription of miRNA-containing genes has been shown to be regulated in the same
way as that of protein-coding genes through the modulation of
the synthesis/activity of various transcription factors, e.g., c-Myc
(4), cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (5), MyoD (6), or
p53 (7–9).
In cancer, a large set of data shows that the expression of
miRNAs is largely altered (10, 11). Specifically, several genomewide miRNA expression studies have shown differential expression between normal tissue and breast tumors or between breast
tumor subgroups (12–16). Of note, the differential expression of
several miRNAs correlates with the status of estrogen receptors
(ERα and ERβ; refs. 13, 15), which are members of the nuclear
hormone receptor transcription factor family. This is particularly
interesting because experimental, clinical, and epidemiologic data
largely suggest that ERs, through their binding to the steroid hormone E2, contribute to the growth of many breast cancers. Furthermore, ERα is considered as one of the most valuable targets
for endocrine-based therapies as it is expressed in 70% to 75% of
early breast cancers (17–19). E2 binding to ERs leads to transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the control of cell
growth. ERs exert many of their effect by interacting directly
or through tethering to other transcription factors bound to
DNA elements located in target gene promoters (20). However,
the set of genes that directly mediate ERs effects on cell growth
has not been fully defined.
Some recent reports have shown a link between E2 and/or ERs
and miRNA expression. E2 treatment of human endometrial stromal cells, endometrial glandular epithelial cells, myometrium, or
leiomyoma smooth muscle cells leads to altered expression of
some miRNAs (21, 22). E2 also regulates miRNA expression in
the adult zebrafish (23). Finally, two miRNAs (miR-206 and
miR-21) have recently been identified as being downregulated by
E2 in the MCF-7 breast tumor cell line (24, 25). However, a high
throughput analysis of E2-regulated miRNAs in breast tumor cell
lines is lacking and the role of miRNAs in estradiol-dependent
functions is poorly documented.
Therefore, we sought to identify E 2 -regulated miRNAs. We
showed that E2 stimulation of various breast/ovarian tumor cell
lines resulted in a widespread repression of miRNA expression that
was needed for E2-dependent in vitro cell growth. We also showed
that the most potent miRNAs in repressing cell growth, miR-26a
and miR-181a, regulated the gene encoding the progesterone receptor and many other genes associated with cell proliferation.
Lastly, we found that the expression of several miRNAs was

Results
Identification of estrogen-regulated miRNAs. To identify estrogen-regulated miRNAs, we initially focused on the ERα-positive
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line as it has been extensively used as a
model of hormone-dependent breast cancer (e.g., refs. 27, 28). We
used a sensitive array for miRNA expression profiling based on
locked nucleic acids–modified capture probes (26). This allowed
us to apply a straightforward RNA isolation procedure devoid of
RNA size selection and/or amplification steps. Strikingly, the predominant consequence of E2 treatment was a widespread repression of miRNA expression. Indeed, we observed that 23 miRNAs (of
125 miRNAs whose expression is detectable on the array according
to our criteria for inclusion; see Materials and Methods) were
significantly (P ≤ 0.05) downregulated following E 2 treatment
(Table 1; Fig. 1A). No upregulated miRNA candidates were obtained following the same criteria. To confirm the expression
changes detected by microarray analysis, real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed on eight candidate miRNAs
(miR-181a, miR-21, miR-181b, miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-200c, miR27b, miR-23b). The expression of these miRNAs decreased upon
E2 treatment (Fig. 1B). To exclude the possibility that E2 treatment
led to an artifactual change in miRNA recovery, we also analyzed
the expression of two miRNA (miR-18a and miR-92) that were not
regulated by E2 according to our microarray data. As expected,
miR-18a and miR-92 did not change their expression upon E2 treatment (Fig. 1B).
As E2 treatment leads to an increase in cell proliferation, and
because miRNA expression is regulated by cell density (29), we
asked whether the observed effects might be linked to differential
cell confluence in the E2-treated cells compared with the vehicletreated cells. We observed no change in miR-26a expression at
different confluence, demonstrating that the difference in the
expression of miR-26a following E2 treatment is not linked to the
state of confluence (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We next analyzed by real-time RT-PCR the expression of the
above-mentioned eight E2-regulated miRNAs in several human

ER-positive breast (T-47D, ZR-75-1, BT-474) or ovarian (BG1) cell
lines. We found that, in all these cell lines, the expression of the
analyzed miRNAs was downregulated by E2 treatment (Fig. 1C).
Therefore, E2-dependent regulation is not restricted to the MCF7 cell line. Interestingly, E2-dependent repression of the expression
of tested miRNAs was absent in the ER-negative SK-BR-3 breast
tumor cell line (Fig. 1C), suggesting that ER is involved in E2dependent miRNA regulation.
Several pri-miRNAs are primary transcriptionally repressed
targets of ER. We noticed that, in most cases, clustered miRNAs
decreased their expression similarly (cluster miR-181a∼181b; miR23b∼27b∼24-1; miR-23a∼27a∼24-2; miR-98∼let-7f-2; Table 1), suggesting a regulation at the transcriptional level. To determine
whether estrogen-dependent transcriptional regulation of miRNA
expression is mediated through ER, the ability of several ER antagonists to block the observed E2 repression was tested. We found
that preincubation of MCF-7 cells with ICI 182,780 (ICI), a pure
antagonist of ER genomic action, or with 4-hydroxytamoxifen
blocked the E2-dependent decrease in the expression of the tested
miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 2A).
The results presented up to now show that a 48-hour-long E2 treatment downregulates the expression of several miRNA-containing
genes. We next asked whether a modulation in the abundance of
miRNAs could also occur at earlier time points. Although no difference in the amount of the tested miRNAs was observed after

6 hours of E2 treatment, a weak but reproducible effect was observed after 18 hours of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). This
shows that the E2-dependent effects on the abundance of miRNAs
is relatively late, starting after 18 hours of treatment, compared
with the known E2-dependent immediate transcription targets that
can be modulated after 3 hours of treatment.
Of note, the miRNA abundance is the result of (a) the transcription of the miRNA-containing gene as a pri-miRNA, (b) the processing of the transcribed pri-miRNA into the mature miRNA, and (c)
the stability of the miRNA. It is therefore possible that the regulation of the transcriptional activity of miRNA-containing genes occurs at early time points but that the effect on miRNA abundance
occurs at later time points due to inefficient processing of the
pri-miRNA or an important stability of the mature miRNA. We
therefore decided to evaluate E 2-dependent regulation of primiRNA expression.
We focused on the two pri-miRNAs containing the most repressed miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-181a∼miR-181b). We found a

3- to 4-fold reduction in the expression of these pri-miRNAs upon
a 3-hour-long E2 treatment (Fig. 2B). This early E2-dependent transcriptional repression was partially lost in the presence of ICI
(Fig. 2B), showing the participation of ER in this effect. This repression was also lost upon treatment with the transcriptional inhibitor
actinomycin D (Fig. 2C), showing that the effect is linked to transcriptional regulation. To next determine whether these primiRNAs were primary targets of ER signaling (i.e., genes regulated
in the absence of de novo protein synthesis), the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on E2 repression was examined. Notably, pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with cycloheximide did
not change the early E2-mediated transcriptional repression of primiR-21 and pri-miR-181a∼b-1 synthesis (Fig. 2C). However, cycloheximide impaired the E2-dependent regulation of pri-miR 17∼92,
a known target of the E2-regulated c-Myc transcription factor
(Fig. 2C; ref. 4). These results indicate that pri-miRNA-21 and primiRNA-181a∼b-1 are primary targets of ER transcriptional action,
this notion being also supported by the presence of ERα binding

sites located at <50 kb around the miR-21 (25) or miR-181a∼b-1
sequences [as reported by Chip-chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments (30); Supplementary Fig. S4].
Specific E2-repressed miRNAs suppress estrogen-dependent
cell proliferation. Because estrogen functions as a mitogen in
ER-positive tumors, the observed downregulation of miRNA expression suggested a possible role for these miRNAs in cancer cell
proliferation. We therefore investigated whether some E2-downregulated miRNAs were able to interfere with E2-dependent cell
growth by analyzing the proliferation activity of MCF-7 cells after
reintroduction of each of the candidate miRNA. E2-treated MCF-7
cells were transfected with either a control miRNA (miR-ctrl) or
each of the eight candidate miRNAs. miR-181a and miR-26a
strongly inhibited E2-dependent cell growth in a time-dependent
manner, whereas MCF-7 cells transfected with miR-ctrl continued
to grow during the period in response to E2 (Fig. 3A). miR-181b,
miR-26b, miR-200c, miR-21, or miR-23b could also inhibit E2dependent cell growth but to a lesser extent than miR-26a and
miR-181a (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, miR-26a and miR-26b, but also
miR-181a and miR-181b, differ from only three nucleotides in their

sequence, highlighting the specificity of the effect. miR-27b had no
effect on cell growth (Fig. 3A).
To further analyze these effects on MCF-7 cell growth, the level
of DNA synthesis was measured after [3H]-thymidine incorporation. Introduction of miR-181a, miR-26a, or miR-200c, but not
miR-ctrl or miR-27b, led to a strong decrease in DNA synthesis
of E2-treated cells (Fig. 3B). Introduction of miR-181b, miR-26b,
miR-21, or miR-23b led to a milder effect in reducing DNA synthesis of E2-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3B). All together, these results
show that among the eight tested E2-regulated miRNAs, seven of
them are functionally involved, although to various extents, in E2dependent cell growth.
We next extended our analysis to define the global changes in
transcriptome induced by miR-26a, one of the most potent miRNA to inhibit proliferation in our study. We therefore decided not
to look only for individual direct predicted mRNA targets of miR26a but to analyze global changes in the transcriptome of the
various treated cells. Thus, we transcriptionally profiled MCF-7
cells grown in the presence of E2 and transfected or not with
miR-26a. We arrived at a set of 503 genes for which expression

is regulated (>1.2-fold; P < 0.05) by miR-26a (Supplementary
Table S2; Fig. 4A). Interestingly, among the miR-26a–regulated
genes, 178 (35%) genes corresponded to genes related to “cellular
growth and proliferation” as determined using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (Supplementary Table S3).
We also described 343 genes for which expression was regulated
in E2-treated compared with vehicle-treated MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Table S4; Fig. 4A). The overlap between this list and the
list of miR-26a–regulated genes yielded a set of 78 genes (Supplementary Table S5; Fig. 4A). We found only 5 genes (among the set

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (21). November 1, 2009

of 78) that contain in silico predicted miR-26a binding sites (Supplementary Fig. S5).
We focused on the PGR (progesterone receptor) gene for several
reasons. First, PGR isoforms (-A and -B) are, such as ERs, members
of the steroid hormone receptor family of transcription factors and
are key mediators of estrogen signaling (31). Second, we noticed
that the extremely long (>9 kpb) PGR 3′UTR had very few conserved predicted miRNA binding sites (miRNA response elements;
Fig. 4B). Moreover, six miRNA (miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-181a, miR181b, miR-23a, miR-23b), of the seven miRNAs predicted to bind to

Estrogen-Regulated MicroRNAs

the PGR 3′UTR, were actually found to be repressed by E2 in our
study (Table 1) including two miRNAs (miR-26a and miR-181a)
that strongly inhibited cell growth (Fig. 3).
We therefore analyzed the expression of PGR in MCF-7 cells
grown in the presence of E2 and transfected with miR-26a or
miR-181a. We found that both miRNAs inhibited the expression
of PGR at the RNA (Fig. 4C) and protein level (Fig. 4D). Conversely,
anti-miRs against miR-26a and miR-181a derepressed PGR expression (Supplementary Fig. S6). Furthermore, the predicted miRNA
response elements are critical for the direct and specific binding
of miR-26a or miR-181a to the PGR mRNA, as judged by luciferase
reporter assays (Supplementary Fig. S7). Overall, this set of results
argues for the involvement of specific miRNAs in suppressing E2dependent cell proliferation through their ability to regulate genes
involved in the control of cell growth, such as the one encoding the
progesterone receptor isoforms.
Regulation of miRNA expression by antiestrogen in breast
cancer. To investigate the regulation of miRNAs expression by
antiestrogen in human breast tumor specimens, we used tumors
from patients participating to a phase II pilot study. Fifteen
postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast tumors (Supplementary Table S6) received, as a neoadjuvant therapy, a combination of exemestane (an inhibitor of CYP19 aromatases,
enzymes catalyzing the last steps of estrogen biosynthesis) and
tamoxifen during 4 months, daily before surgery. As expected, a
decrease in the expression of biological markers involved in the
estrogenic transduction pathway (ER, PGR), and in proliferation
(Ki-67 and cyclin D1) was generally observed after treatment

(Supplementary Table S7; Fig. 5, top). An example of the histopathologic response as well as cyclin D1 expression for one
among the responsive tumors (patient 7) is shown in Fig. 5.
We isolated RNAs from the initial breast tumor biopsy and from
the surgery specimen for 10 patients and analyzed the expression
of several miRNAs by real-time RT-PCR. The expression of miR-92,
which is not regulated by E2 (Fig. 1A), was unchanged upon treatment (Fig. 5, bottom). The expression of most of the candidate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-181b, miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-27b, miR-23b),
except for miR-181a and miR-200c, was higher after treatment
(Fig. 5, bottom), showing regulation of miRNA expression by tamoxifen combined with exemestane in breast cancer.

Discussion
Multiple lines of evidence provided here argue for the involvement of specific miRNAs in E2-dependent cellular response. A
set of 23 miRNAs (including miR-181a, miR-21, miR-181b, miR26a, miR-200c, miR-26b, miR-27b, miR-23b for which a more
detailed study was carried out) are downregulated by E2 in a
number of ER-containing human cell lines. The RNA precursors
of miRNAs (i.e., pri-miR-21 and pri-miR-181a∼b-1) are primary
immediate transcriptionally repressed targets of ER. The expression of most of these miRNAs is upregulated by antiestrogen
treatment in breast tumors. Several miRNAs, the most potent being miR-26a and miR-181a, counteract the E2-dependent increase
in cell proliferation, through a global deregulation of genes (e.g.,
progesterone receptor) involved in the control of cell growth.

miRNAs are thus uncovered as another class of molecules that
modulate E2-dependent functions.
Recently, two miRNAs (miR-206 and miR-21) were identified
as being downregulated by E2 in MCF-7 (24, 25). In our miRNA
microarray analysis, we indeed found an E2-dependent repression of miR-21 expression (Supplementary Table S1; also see
Table 1 and Fig. 1). However, we could not find any evidences
of E2-dependent miR-206 regulation of expression. This may be
consistent with the apparent lack of miR-206 expression in
MCF-7 cells (32) as also discussed by Pandey and Picard (33).
For miR-21, our results differ from that of Wickramasinghe
and colleagues (25) concerning the time at which the repression
was observed. The reason for that is unknown but may be due
to slightly different cell conditions (e.g., serum starvation times,
cell confluences). It was also recently shown that E2 induced the
expression of several miRNAs, including miR-21, in MCF-7p cells,
a derivative of MCF-7 cells that contain a bicistronic vector (34).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (21). November 1, 2009

The simplest way to explain this discrepancy is to consider the
difference in the cell line used, because we and others (25) have
used the parental MCF-7 cell line.
In any cases, our work shows that a full set of miRNAs are actually downregulated by E2 in MCF-7 cells. It also provides evidences for regulation of miR-21 and several other miRNAs by an
antiestrogen treatment (tamoxifen combined with exemestane)
in breast cancer.
For two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-181a), we have shown an early transcriptional inhibition of the expression of the corresponding
pri-miRNAs. Interestingly, according to Carroll and colleagues (30),
several ER binding sites can be found at 50 kb around the miR-21
sequence (Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 25). Furthermore, chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the direct binding of
ERα to the miR-21 promoter sequence (34). The position of these
sites may account for ER action as correlation of ER binding
sites with estrogen-regulated genes showed a bias of binding sites

Estrogen-Regulated MicroRNAs

within 50 kb of the transcription start sites of these genes (30).
Strikingly, the E2 effects on all the tested miRNAs were ER dependent and 80% of the E2-repressed miRNA contained one or more
ER binding sites in a region of 50 kb surrounding the miRNA sequence (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, the regulation of these
miRNAs may follow the same kind of mechanisms.
Noteworthy, global downregulation of miRNA expression is
common in cancer (12) and contributes to tumorigenesis (35). This
can be achieved through widespread transcriptional repression
(36) or impaired miRNA processing (35). Avoidance of gene regulation by miRNAs can also occur through regulation of the presence of miRNA binding sites in mRNAs. In this context, it has
been recently shown that globally shifting gene expression to
shorter 3′UTR isoforms, devoid of target sequences for specific
miRNAs, is a mechanism to control proliferation during lymphocyte activation (37). Together with our data, these findings suggest
that gene expression regulation by miRNAs generally tends to suppress cell proliferation/transformation.
It will now be important to more deeply describe how estrogens modulate gene expression through downregulation of miRNA expression. The E2-regulated miR-206 was shown to directly
downregulate the expression of ERα (24, 38), although this conclusion was contradicted by Pandey and Picard (33). We have
found that the E2-dependent downregulation of miR-26a and
miR-181a leads to upregulation of PGR, possibly through their direct binding to the PGR 3′ UTR. This leads to the interesting notion that, to be efficiently expressed, a gene that is directly
upregulated at the transcriptional level by E2 (such as PGR) also
has to avoid miRNA-dependent posttranscriptional repression.
This can be achieved by E2-dependent downregulation of miRNAs
expression. Therefore PGR, and possibly several other genes, may
be regulated at two levels by E2: a direct transcriptional effect
and an indirect posttranscriptional effect through E2-dependent
repression of miRNA expression. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that
PGR alone can explain the effects of miR-26a and miR-181a on

cell growth. It will therefore be essential to define novel targets
for these miRNA.
Our data on regulation of miRNA expression in breast tumors
from postmenopausal patients with ER-positive breast cancer that
were administered an antiestrogen neoadjuvant treatment for
several months before surgery leads to several interesting perspectives. One of the main aims of neoadjuvant therapy is the validation of predictive factors of response, which could allow optimizing
the adjuvant therapy and then hopefully increasing the disease-free
and overall survival. In this study, we assessed the use of miRNAs
as potential predictive biomarkers. We observed a marked increase
in the expression of several miRNAs (miR-21, miR-181b, miR-26a,
miR-26b, miR-27b, miR-23b) upon antiestrogen treatment. Interestingly, several of these miRNAs (miR-21, miR-23b, miR-181b)
were shown as being differentially expressed in tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 (39). Therefore, the analysis of the expression of these candidate miRNAs in larger cohorts may certainly warrant further investigation to help in the evaluation of the response to hormonal
therapy.
