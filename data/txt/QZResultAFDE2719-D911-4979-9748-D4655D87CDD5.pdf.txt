Abstract
MLN4924 is a first-in-class experimental cancer drug that inhibits the NEDD8-activating enzyme, thereby
inhibiting cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases and stabilizing many cullin substrates. The mechanism by which
MLN4924 inhibits cancer cell proliferation has not been defined, although it is accompanied by DNA
rereplication and attendant DNA damage. Here we show that stabilization of the DNA replication factor
Cdt1, a substrate of cullins 1 and 4, is critical for MLN4924 to trigger DNA rereplication and inhibit cell
proliferation. Even only 1 hour of exposure to MLN4924, which was sufficient to elevate Cdt1 for 4–5 hours, was
found to be sufficient to induce DNA rereplication and to activate apoptosis and senescence pathways. Cells in S
phase were most susceptible, suggesting that MLN4924 will be most toxic on highly proliferating cancers.
Although MLN4924-induced cell senescence seems to be dependent on induction of p53 and its downstream
effector p21Waf1, we found that p53/ and p21/ cells were even more susceptible than wild-type cells to
MLN4924. Our results suggested that apoptosis, not senescence, might be more important for the antiproliferative effect of MLN4924. Furthermore, our findings show that transient exposure to this new investigational
drug should be useful for controlling p53-negative cancer cells, which often pose significant clinical challenge.

Introduction
Duplication of the genetic material is a key event in the cell
cycle. In eukaryotes, replication origins are recognized and
bound by a 6-subunit complex called ORC (Origin Recognizing
Complex; refs. 1–3). Cdc6 and Cdt1 are subsequently recruited
independently to those sites in late M or early G1 phase (1, 3,
4), followed by the recruitment of MCM2–7 complex to initiate
DNA replication (5, 6). It is vitally important that the initiation
of replication at replication origins is tightly controlled such
that it occurs only once during the cell cycle. Mammalian cells
have developed different mechanisms to prevent reinitiation
and subsequent rereplication of DNA within the same cell
cycle. One such mechanism is the inactivation of Cdt1 during S
and G2 phases (7, 8). After replication initiation, Cdt1 is either
inhibited by a small protein called Geminin (9, 10) or degraded
by 2 distinct E3 ligases, cdk-dependent SCFskp2 and Cul4-

DDB1cdt2 in S or G2/M phase (8, 11). Deregulation of those
pathways by depletion of Geminin, Cul4, or Cdt2 activates (or
stabilizes) Cdt1 and consequently induces DNA rereplication
in different systems (7, 12–14).
Studies have shown that cullin-RING ligases (CRL), a subclass of E3 ligases that includes both SCFskp2 and CRL4Cdt2, are
modified by an ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8, which subsequently facilitates their ligase activities (15–18). Thus, through
the modulation of this activity, the NEDD8 pathway regulates
the abundance of CRL substrates. MLN4924, a potential
cancer drug currently in phase I clinical trials, is a small
molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE; refs. 19,
20). MLN4924 treatment in HCT116 human colon cancer–
derived cell line inhibits NAE, and therefore the NEDD8
conjugation pathway, resulting in an increase in protein
abundance of CRL substrates such as Cdt1 (21). This is
accompanied by an increase in the percentage of cells containing more than 4N DNA, indicating DNA rereplication was
occurring. Cells treated with MLN4924 also undergo significant apoptosis contributing to the drug's antiproliferative
activity. Various CRL substrates play critical functions in
cellular growth and survival pathways and the question
remained as to which substrates are critical for MLN4924induced rereplication and apoptosis.
In this article, we examine whether Cdt1 is the key factor for
the induction of DNA rereplication in HCT116 cells treated
with MLN4924. Among the different approaches for stimulating Cdt1 activation, MLN4924 shares a similarity with that
of Cdt2 depletion in inactivating the CRL4cdt2 E3 ligase, as

Effect of Transient Exposure of HCT116 to MLN4924

opposed to Geminin depletion, which activates Cdt1 by a
different pathway. We verified this hypothesis and detected a
synergistic effect between MLN4924 treatment and Geminin
depletion. Transient exposure of cells to MLN4924 led to DNA
rereplication, as well as activation of the apoptosis and
senescence pathways. This allowed us to test whether a
specific part of the cell cycle was particularly susceptible or
resistant to MLN4924. Finally, we compared the sensitivity of
wild-type (WT) HCT116 cells and isogenic p53/ or p21/
HCT116 cells to MLN4924 and discovered that WT HCT116
cells were less susceptible to MLN4924-induced cell death. The
results indicate that p53-deficient cancer cells may be more
sensitive to MLN4924, emphasizing the therapeutic opportunity with this class of investigational drugs.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and chemicals
Human colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 (WT, p53,
p21) were cultured in McCoy's 5A-modified medium
(HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin-streptomycin. Isogenic p21/ and p53/
HCT116 cell lines were described earlier (22). Millennium
Pharmaceuticals Inc. provided MLN4924, which was then
dissolved in DMSO (Sigma). The concentration of Z-VadFMK (Calbiochem) used was 50 mmol/L. The concentration
of nocodazole (Sigma) used was 40 ng/mL.
siRNA
Short interfering (siRNA) oligonucleotides (Invitrogen)
were made to the following target sequences (sense): GL2
(control), AACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA; Cdt1, GCAAUGUUGGCCAGAUCAA; Cdc6, GAUCGACUUAAUCAGGUAU;
Mcm7, GAUGUCCUGGACGUUUACA; Geminin (Gem), UGCCAACUCUGGAAUCAAA (12); Cdt2, GAAUUAUACUGCUUAUCGA. Transfections were conducted with 20 nmol/L
siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of manufacturer.

Time-lapse movie analysis
HCT116 cells were plated at 15,000 cells per well in 6-well
culture plates (Becton Dickinson). For continuous treatment,
cells were treated with 1 mmol/L MLN4924 for 72 hours. For
washout treatment, HCT-116 cells were treated with 1 mmol/L
MLN4924 for 8 hours, washed with fresh media to remove
compound, and then maintained in fresh compound-free
media for 8 days. Time-lapse movie images were taken at
times indicated using an automated TE2000U microscope
(Nikon Instruments) with Hoffman-modulation optics, 20
objective, with environmental control, and an Orca-ER CCD
camera (Hamamatsu) controlled with MetaMorph imaging
software (Molecular Devices).
Measure cell growth and clonogenicity
The number of viable cells was estimated with a cell
proliferation assay (MTT) kit (Promega) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded into 96-well
plates at 500 cells per well, treated with DMSO or MLN4924,
and incubated for 7 days before MTT assay. Cell clonogenicity
assay was conducted as described (25). Cells were seeded into
6-well plates at 3  103 cells per well. DMSO or 1 mmol/L
MLN4924 was added for 8 hours. Cells were washed twice with
PBS and incubated in fresh medium after the washout.
Medium was changed every 2–3 days and the colonies were
stained with crystal violet to show cell clonogenicity. OD595
was measured to quantify cell colony numbers and normalized to DMSO-treated control sample to obtain cell survival
rate.
SA-b-gal staining assay for senescence
Senescence b-galactosidase staining assay was conducted
in a 6-well plate with staining kit (Cell Signaling Technology;
no. 9860). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed, and stained
following manufacturer's instruction. Stained plates were
checked under a microscope for development of blue color.
For each sample, SA-b-gal–positive and total cell numbers
were counted from 5 different microscopic fields (roughly
>200 cells per field).

Results
Antibodies and immunoblotting
Rabbit anti-Cdt1, rabbit anti-Geminin, and rabbit anti-Cdt2
were raised as described (9, 23). The purchased antibodies
were mouse anti-p21 (Lab Vision/Neomarkers); mouse antib-actin, mouse anti-Chk1, mouse anti-Chk2 (Sigma); rabbit
anti-Chk1-P-S317, rabbit anti-Chk2-P-T68; rabbit anti-PARP,
rabbit anti-H3-P-S10 (Upstate). Cells were lysed as described
(24), and Western blot analysis was conducted according to
standard procedures.
Flow cytometric analysis (FACS)
Cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed with 70%
ethanol overnight at 80 C. Cells were then stained and
analyzed as described before (12). For FACS analysis with
both propidium iodide (PI) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
double staining, cells were labeled with 10 mmol/L BrdU
(Sigma) and then harvested as described earlier (12).

Stabilization of Cdt1 protein is critical for MLN4924induced rereplication in HCT116 cells
Consistent with previous results (21), we observed rereplication after 20 hours of treatment of HCT116 cells with MLN4924
(Fig. 1A). To investigate whether the regulation of Cdt1 protein
level plays a role in MLN4924-induced rereplication, HCT116
cells were treated with siRNA oligonucleotides targeting Cdt1
for 48 hours prior to the addition of MLN4924. After 20 hours of
MLN4924 treatment, Cdt1 protein level increased significantly
as expected (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) and more than 40% of cells
were determined to have rereplicated, containing >4N DNA
content. However, in the cells depleted of Cdt1 by siRNA, the
percentage of rereplicating cells reduced to 15% (Fig. 1A). In
these cells, Cdt1 protein expression was effectively repressed
(Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 3, and 4), although at a higher exposure, Cdt1
protein level was observed to be modestly induced in

MLN4924-treated cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that
the drug was still inhibiting its degradation, potentially explaining the 15% of cells with >4N DNA.
Rereplication has been shown to induce both single-strand
and double-strand DNA breaks, resulting in activation of
checkpoint pathways (24, 26). Indeed, we observed both
Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation in MLN4924-treated cells
(Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Cdt1 siRNA treatment not only
decreased the percentage of cells undergoing rereplication
but also decreased the activation of Chk1 and Chk2 (Fig. 1B,
lanes 2 and 4), indicating that MLN4924 induces DNA damage
primarily through Cdt1-dependent rereplication.
To characterize whether other replication initiators contribute to the rereplication induced by MLN4924, we systematically depleted other components of the prereplicative
complex. We treated HCT116 cells hypomorphic for ORC2
(27) with MLN4924 and compared the extent of rereplication
with that of WT cells. As shown before, although we could
detect ORC2 in 6 mg of extract from WT HCT116 cells, it was
hard to detect ORC in even 60 mg of e83 HCT116 cells (Sup-

plementary Fig. S1A). Despite this, there was no significant
difference in the amount of rereplication between these cell
types (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we conducted siRNA knockdown
of both MCM7 and Cdc6 (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C) and
observed no difference in the amount of MLN4924-induced
rereplication in both cases (Fig. 1D, 1E). Interestingly, we
noticed that MLN4924 treatment could also induce Cdc6
protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S1C), which indicated
that Cdc6 could be a potential CRL substrate. Overall, these
results show that the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Cdt1
protein is the rate-limiting step in preventing rereplication and
that stabilization of this component of the prereplicative
complex by MLN4924 induces rereplication in HCT116 cells.
The rereplication leads to DNA damage and activates checkpoint pathways.

was more than that observed in cells treated with MLN4924
alone, and adding the 2 together did not increase rereplication
(Fig. 2B). This suggests that a) pure CRL4Cdt2 inhibition with
siCdt2 is more effective at inducing rereplication than inhibiting all cullins by MLN4924, but b) once Cdt1 level has crossed a
certain threshold, there is no further increase in rereplication
with more Cdt1. In addition, other substrates/pathways
affected by MLN4924 may make cells die, thereby decreasing
the extent of rereplication observed.
In contrast to the lack of synergy in induction of rereplication by siCdt1 þ MLN4924, siGeminin (to activate Cdt1 in S
through G2 phase) þ MLN4924 caused more rereplication
than either agent alone. This is particularly evident when one
considers the proportion of cells with >6N DNA content
(Fig. 2B).
These results suggest that removal of an inhibitor of Cdt1
(Geminin) will act additively with stabilization of Cdt1 by
MLN4924 to cause more rereplication. In contrast, inhibition
of CRL4cdt2 by siCdt2 and MLN4924 does not additively cause
more rereplication, even though there was more stabilization
of Cdt1. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that
MLN4924 causes rereplication primarily through the inhibition of CRL4cdt2.

ubiquitin ligases known to degrade Cdt1 (28–32). Cdt2 depletion, and thus inactivation of CRL4Cdt2, in zebra fish, Xenopus
egg extracts, and human cancer cells induces DNA rereplication (13, 33). If CRL4cdt2 inhibition is the primary mechanism
by which MLN4924 causes rereplication, one would predict
that there should be no synergy between MLN4924 and siCdt2
in induction of rereplication.
To determine whether MLN4924 acts through the same
mechanism to induce rereplication as that of Cdt2 depletion,
we compared the Cdt1 protein level in cells depleted of Cdt2
by siRNA or treated with MLN4924. As seen in Figure 2A, Cdt2
depletion caused less Cdt1 accumulation than MLN4924 alone
(Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3) and together the 2 stabilized Cdt1 more
(lane 4). However, the extent of rereplication caused by siCdt2

Transient exposure of HCT116 cells to MLN4924
induces rereplication
One advantage of using MLN4924 treatment to induce
rereplication lies in its ability to act rapidly. Previous studies
have shown that in as little as 5 minutes following MLN4924
treatment, the NEDD8 pathway is inhibited concurrent with
the accumulation of Cdt1 protein (20, 21). Therefore, we
wanted to test whether transient treatment of MLN4924 is
sufficient to induce rereplication in HCT116 cells.
Surprisingly, as shown in Figure 3A, 1-hour exposure to
MLN4924 was sufficient to induce rereplication in 40% of the
cells. The percentage of cells with rereplication increased with
longer pulse of MLN4924 but was close to its maximum after 4
or 8 hours of treatment, with 60% of cells rereplicating their
DNA.
To determine the rate of Cdt1 turnover following MLN4924
washout, we treated HCT116 cells with MLN4924 for 4 hours
and harvested the cells after different time periods. Cdt1
protein level increased following MLN4924 treatment
(Fig. 3B, W0). However, by 4 hours after washout, Cdt1 level
decreased to basal levels (Fig. 3B, W4). These results indicate
that although Cdt1 stability returns to normal in roughly 4
hours after the removal of MLN4924, this short period of Cdt1
stabilization is sufficient to induce irreversible DNA rereplication.
S-phase cells are more susceptible to MLN4924-induced
rereplication
Because a mere 4-hour pulse treatment of MLN4924 leads
to rereplication, we decided to test whether the portion of
the cell cycle was more susceptible to the drug exposure.
HCT116 cells synchronized by nocodazole block/mitotic
shake-off were exposed to MLN4924 at the indicated times
postmitosis (Fig. 4A). Cells were then collected for flow

cytometric analysis (FACS). As shown in Figure 4B, cells
started to enter G1 around 4 hours after nocodazole release
and began S phase after approximately 12 hours. This
suggests that the majority of the cells were in M/G1 at T4
and in either S phase or at the G1/S transition at T12. We
saw a similar increase in Cdt1 protein level after MLN4924
treatment in both populations (Fig. 4C). However, whereas
only 10% of the cells rereplicated when Cdt1 was stabilized
in M/G1-phase cells, 50% of the cells showed rereplication
upon stabilization of Cdt1 in S-phase cells (Fig. 4D). These
results show that S-phase cells are more susceptible to
MLN4924-induced DNA rereplication.
To ask whether cells must be in S phase for MLN4924 to
induce rereplication, we labeled the cells with BrdU for 40
minutes to mark cells in active S phase, washed out BrdU, and
added MLN4924 for 4 hours. Cells were collected for FACS
after 20 hours (Fig. 4E). BrdU-positive cells, which were
actively replicating when exposed to MLN4924, showed 44%
of cells rereplicating, whereas only 14% of the BrdU-negative
cells rereplicated (Fig. 4F). These results further show that
actively replicating cells are more susceptible to MLN4924induced rereplication.

Both checkpoint and apoptosis pathways are activated
upon short exposure of cells to MLN4924
Rereplication induces DNA damage and checkpoint activation (24, 26, 34). The initiation of DNA rereplication by a short
exposure to MLN4924 led us to test whether checkpoint
pathways were similarly activated in those cells. We treated
HCT116 cells with MLN4924 for 8 hours and harvested cells 24
or 72 hours after washout. Chk1 was activated 24 hours after
drug washout, whereas DNA rereplication was seen in 30% to
55% of cells (at 1 and 3 mmol/L MLN4924, respectively). The
DNA damage checkpoint pathway still persisted even at 72
hours after washout, when rereplication was observed in 10%
to 25% of cells (Fig. 5A and B). In addition, we noticed that
PARP cleavage happened only at the later time point, suggesting that apoptosis was not activated until 72 hours after
washout. This was further confirmed by the increase in
sub-G1 population cells (Fig. 5B). Overall, these results were
consistent with the idea that even transient exposure of
MLN4924 leads to rereplication, activates checkpoint pathways, and eventually induces apoptosis following irreparable
DNA damage.
Senescence is induced after transient exposure to
MLN4924 through the induction of p53 and p21
When culturing cells after transient exposure to MLN4924,
we noticed changes in cell morphology starting approximately
72 hours post-washout, including an increase in cell size,
intracellular vesicle accumulation, and flatness. As shown
in the top panel of Figure 6A, after 48 hours or more of
continuous exposure to MLN4924, cells shrank and became
round, suggesting that these cells were undergoing apoptosis.
However, after a transient 8-hour exposure to MLN4924, cells
exhibited the flattened, vesiculated morphology, often noticed
when cellular senescence pathway is activated.
Senescence is marked by permanent withdrawal from the
cell cycle. To test whether MLN4924 induces senescence, we
first conducted colony formation assays to determine the
clonogenicity of the cells (35). We added MLN4924 to
HCT116 cells for 8 hours and cultured cells for 7 days after
washout for colony formation as measured by crystal violet
staining (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Quantitation of the optical
density of staining (Fig. 6B) showed that MLN4924 treatment
suppressed the clonogenicity, a characteristic of senescent
cells.
Senescence associated-b-gal (SA-b-gal) staining is a wellaccepted biomarker of senescence (36). Transient treatment
of cells with MLN4924 increased the percentage of rereplicating cells (Fig. 3A) and the percentage of SA-b-gal staining
(Fig. 6C and D). This suggested that the senescence pathway
was activated upon transient exposure to MLN4924. These
results were consistent with the earlier findings that rereplication can activate the DNA damage response leading to
cellular senescence (37).
We next examined whether reduction of rereplication by
Cdt1 depletion could decrease senescence following MLN4924
treatment. We conducted a similar assay as that displayed in
Figure 1A, except that the HCT116 cells were exposed to
MLN4924 for only 8 hours and cells collected for FACS after

24 hours or SA-b-gal staining after 72 hours (Fig. 6E). Consistent with our hypothesis, Cdt1 depletion reduced both
rereplication and senescence to a similar degree. Together,
these data suggest that rereplication induced by transient
exposure to MLN4924 leads to senescence. Eight-hour exposure to MLN4924 also induced apoptosis, as measured by the
cleavage of PARP (Fig. 5A). Thus, transient treatment with
MLN4924 induces senescence or apoptosis (also evident in
Fig. 6A, 72 hours per washout), whereas continuous treatment
with the drug leads mostly to apoptosis (Fig. 6A, 72 hours).
Both p53 and p21 can have a function in the cellular
senescence pathway (38, 39). We therefore examined protein
expression levels of p53 and p21 over 8 days following an 8hour treatment with MLN4924. Both p53 and p21 were
induced 24 hours post-washout and their expression persisted
thereafter for the entire time course (Fig. 6F). We then
conducted the SA-b-gal staining assay in p53/ or p21/

HCT116 cells to determine the level of senescence in the
absence of these proteins. As shown in Figure 6G, the number
of SA-b-gal–stained cells was only half in the p21/ HCT116
compared with those of WT HCT116, indicating that p21 plays
an important role in the senescence pathway. p53 seemed to
be less essential than p21, which was consistent with results
from other studies (40). The p16 gene is silenced in these cells
(41), so the residual senescence in the p21/ cells was most
likely by a p21- and p16-independent pathway.
p21- and p53-deficient HCT116 cells are more sensitive
to transient treatment with MLN4924
Because transient exposure to MLN4924 causes both senescence and apoptosis, but senescence is attenuated in the
p21/ cells, we could ask how important is the senescence
for the toxicity of MLN4924 on cancer cells. We noticed
that although p21- and p53-deficient cells exhibited less

senescence after transient treatment with MLN4924, the total
cell numbers observed were much less than in WT cells, which
suggested that p53/ or p21/ HCT116 cells might be more
susceptible to overall cell death or growth inhibition by
MLN4924. Colony formation assays following an 8-hour treatment of MLN4924 in all 3 cell lines confirmed this (Fig. 7A).
Consistent with our previous results (Fig. 6B), colony formation was decreased by MLN4924 treatment in a dose-dependent manner in WT HCT116 cells, but the p53- and p21deficient cells formed fewer colonies than WT cells, indicating
that the absence of p53 or p21 sensitized the cells to the drug
treatment. As senescence is attenuated in the mutant cells
(Fig. 6G), the result suggests that apoptosis pathways are
important for cell killing after transient exposure to MLN4924.
We also conducted an MTT cell growth assay to compare
cell survival rate upon either transient or 72-hour continuous
exposure to MLN4924. After 8-hour treatment, the IC50 for
WT, p53/, and p21/ cells were 0.9, 0.18, and 0.25 mmol/L,
respectively (Fig. 7B), which was consistent with the results of
the colony formation assays. However, the difference was
much smaller upon 72-hour continuous exposure: IC50 of
0.08, 0.07, and 0.07 mmol/L in WT, p53/, and p21/ cells,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4A).

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

To confirm that cells with mutant p53 were more susceptible
to cell death by MLN4924, we conducted MTT assay in MCF7
cells after MLN4924 transient exposure. After p53 knockdown,
IC50 decreased from 0.68 to 0.4 mmol/L (Fig 7B, Supplementary
Fig. S4B). Similar results were obtained when we compared IC50
in 2 lung cancer cells (Fig 7B): NCI-H23 mutant p53 (IC50 ¼ 0.28
mmol/L) and NCI-H460 (wild type p53 ¼ IC50 1.5 mM). Intriguingly, when we compared IC50 in more than 20 cancer cell lines
upon 72 hours MLN4924 treatment, after dividing them into
p53 WT (wild type) group and p53 MT (mutant) group, we
found the median value of WT group was significantly higher
than MT group (465 nmol/L vs. 280 nmol/L; Supplementary
Fig. S4C) despite all the different genetic backgrounds. It must
be noted, however, that there are other genetic factors that
affect MLN4924 sensitivity besides p53 status. For example, we
obtained opposite results when comparing MCF7 (WT p53)
with MDA-MB-231 (MT p53) cells, whereby the MCF7 cells
were more susceptible to MLN4924 (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
Despite this exception, our data suggest that p53 mutant cells
are generally more susceptible to MLN4924.
Thus, there is a clear therapeutic advantage of transient
MLN4924 treatment, particularly considering that the p53
mutant cells are more susceptible to cell death than the
p53 WT cells. Because up to 50% of human tumors have a
mutant p53 gene, our results suggest that the kinetics of
MLN4924 administration might alter the therapeutic index.

Discussion
As a potential anticancer drug, MLN4924 was discovered to
inhibit NAE activity, inhibit cullins, increase the expression of
CRL substrates, induce rereplication, and cause cell death (21).
In this article, we showed that the regulation of Cdt1 protein
level is the rate-limiting step for the induction of rereplication
upon MLN4924 treatment. It is noteworthy that even transient
exposure of HCT116 colon cancer cells to MLN4924 leads to
DNA rereplication. Once rereplication is induced, DNA
damage checkpoint pathways are activated, which then lead
to apoptosis and cellular senescence. We found that p53/
and p21/ HCT116 cells were both more sensitive to
MLN4924 exposure than wild type cells, indicating that cancer
cells with p53 mutations were likely more susceptible to
transient exposure to the drug.
Various CRL substrates accumulate upon MLN4924 treatment, including Cdt1, p27, NRF2 (21), and possibly Cdc6
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). However, our data suggest that
the deregulation of Cdt1 protein level plays an essential role in
DNA rereplication induction, as shown by the decline in
rereplication when Cdt1 is knocked down. That depletion
of Orc2, MCM7, and Cdc6 did not prevent rereplication should
not be interpreted to say that prereplicative complex components are not required for rereplication. The more likely
hypothesis is that these proteins are in vast excess and so
do not become rate limiting for rereplication after siRNA
depletion.
We noticed a high G2 peak and a residual 15% of cells
rereplicating after MLN4924 treatment in Cdt1-depleted
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The 15% of cells labeled as

rereplicating could arise from the tail of the large G2/M peak
observed and may not be real rereplication that leads to DNA
damage, as there was no activation of either Chk1 or Chk2 in
these cells (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data show that
MLN4924 cause a G2/M arrest, consistent with the report that
siCdt2 can induce G2/M arrest (13). This hypothesis was
further confirmed by the increased phosphorylation of
Cdc2 on Y15 and the loss of phosphorylation of H3 on S10
in cells treated with MLN4924 (Supplementary Fig. S1E),
indicating that cells cannot enter mitosis. None of these
changes, increase in G2 population, increase in Cdc2-P-Y15,
and decrease in H3 phosphorylation, were relieved by decreasing Cdt1. Thus, unlike rereplication, the G2/M block seen with

www.aacrjournals.org

MLN4924 may be due to stabilization of substrates other than
Cdt1.
In vivo data suggested that Cdt1 protein level peaked at 2–4
hours after injection of MLN4924 into tumor-bearing mice and
started to decrease by 4–8 hours postinjection (21). Therefore,
we hoped to evaluate the effect of transient exposure of cancer
cells to MLN4924. Amazingly even 1-hour exposure was
sufficient to induce rereplication in 40% of a colon cancer
cell population in culture. With short treatment, we discovered that S-phase cells were more susceptible to MLN4924induced rereplication, which is consistent with the idea that Sphase cells have already licensed origins (and fired many of
them), so that relicensing by transient stabilization of Cdt1

would cause rereplication. The observations that transient
exposure can lead to rereplication and S-phase cells are more
susceptible to this exposure are positive indicators for the
clinical usefulness of this compound.
In addition to activation of apoptosis, we observed activation of senescence pathway after transient exposure of
MLN4924. As previously stated, this was not due to a reduction
in rereplication, as HCT116 cells displayed an equivalent
increase in cells with a >4N DNA content even after short
treatment with MLN4924 compared with continuous treatment (Fig. 3). This rereplication subsequently led to DNA
damage and activated checkpoint and apoptosis pathways
(Fig. 5). Unexpectedly, we observed that the senescence phe-

notype did not appear in continuously treated cells (Fig. 6A).
Although there was barely any difference in the extent of
rereplication between the 2 treatments, DNA damage signals
(DDS) were possibly different, resulting in a different choice of
cell fate between apoptosis and senescence (42). Upon short
exposure, no new DDS occurred from persistent origin refirings, which likely occurred in the continuously treated cells.
This lower level of DNA damage signaling perhaps is not great
enough in duration or extent to trigger cells apoptosis, though
it is sufficient to induce p21 and p53.
One remaining question is what activates senescence. Is it
related to rereplication-induced DNA damage? Previous articles suggested DNA damage caused by rereplication could

activate the senescence pathway (37, 43, 44). In our hands,
depletion of Geminin or Emi1 in HCT116 cells similarly
induced senescence after 3–4 days (data not shown). Consistent with this idea, decrease in rereplication by depletion of
Cdt1 reduced cellular senescence (Fig. 6E). Thus, the senescence is triggered by the rereplication-induced DNA damage.
Another intriguing question is, once cell fate has been determined, is it reversible? We treated cells with Z-VAD-FMK
together with MLN4924 to inhibit cells from entering apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, there was no significant increase in senescence, which suggested an irreversible
commitment to apoptotic, nonsenescent pathways.
It has already been suggested that p53 and p21 levels are
increased during cellular senescence (45, 46). Multiple studies
have shown that the p53–p21 pathway is critical for senescence to occur in human fibroblasts and cancer cells (38, 42,
47, 48). However, some researchers have observed that
although p53 and p21 are positive factors in senescence, they
are not necessary (49). Our results suggest that p53 and p21
have important functions in initiating cellular senescence
upon MLN4924 treatment in tumor cells, but they are dispensable given that p53/ or p21/ cells showed decreased
but not absent SA-b-gal staining (Fig. 6G).
Although both p53/ and p21/ HCT116 cells underwent
less senescence than WT cells, both were more susceptible to
cell death after transient treatment with MLN4924 (Fig. 7),
suggesting a shifting of the balance toward a more apoptotic

phenotype upon intermittent treatment in those cells. This
p53-independent susceptibility to MLN4924 is potentially
critical for clinical applications, where nearly half of human
tumors have mutated their p53 gene. Conventional chemotherapy is less effective in p53 mutant cells. Thus,
MLN4924 is exceptional in its ability to target p53 mutant
tumors.
