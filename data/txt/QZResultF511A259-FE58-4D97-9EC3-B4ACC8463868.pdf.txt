Abstract
Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) plays a critical role in monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated
cancer therapy. ADCC, however, has not been directly shown in vivo but inferred from the requirement for IgG Fc
receptors (FcgR) in tumor rejection in mice. Here, we investigated the mechanism of action of a Tn antigenspecific chimeric mAb (Chi-Tn), which binds selectively to a wide variety of carcinomas, but not to normal
tissues, in both humans and mice. Chi-Tn mAb showed no direct toxicity against carcinomas cell lines in vitro
but induced the rejection of a murine breast tumor in 80% to 100% of immunocompetent mice, when associated
with cyclophosphamide. Tumor rejection was abolished in Fc receptors–associated g chain (FcR-g)–deficient
mice, suggesting a role for ADCC. Indeed, tumor cells formed stable conjugates in vivo with FcR-g chainexpressing macrophages and neutrophils in Chi-Tn mAb-treated but not in control mAb-treated mice. The
contact zone between tumor cells and ADCC effectors accumulated actin, FcgR and phospho-tyrosines. The in
vivo formed ADCC synapses were organized in multifocal supra-molecular activation clusters. These results
show that in vivo ADCC mediated by macrophages and neutrophils during tumor rejection by Chi-Tn mAb
involves a novel type of multifocal immune synapse between effectors of innate immunity and tumor cells.

Introduction
The mechanisms of action of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are still matter of debate (1, 2). In vitro, certain
therapeutic mAbs including trastuzumab (recognizing Her2/
neu, used in breast cancers) or cetuximab (specific for the
epidermal growth factor receptor, used in colon carcinomas)
affect tumor cell growth by blocking receptor signalling. Other
mAbs such as the anti-CD20 rituximab and the anti-CD52
alemtuzumab (both used in B cell neoplasia) induce apoptosis
by direct transmembrane signaling (1, 3). In addition to these
direct antitumor effects, therapeutic mAbs can kill tumor cells
indirectly, through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
(ADCC), phagocytosis, or through complement dependent
cell cytotoxicity (CDC). Although the mechanisms of tumor
growth inhibition in vivo in animal models or in patients have

proved very difficult to unravel, there is good evidence that Fc
receptors for IgG (FcgR) are somehow involved. This was
shown for rituximab and trastuzumab-mediated immunotherapy in mouse tumor models (4–6) using different
FcgR-deficient mice. Recently, de Haij and colleagues (6)
showed that a mutation in the FcgR-associated g (FcR-g)
chain that prevents cell activation and ADCC, but does not
affect FcgR expression at the cell surface, also prevented
antibody-mediated tumor rejection. In humans, patients bearing high affinity alleles of activating FcgRs (FcgRIIIa-158V/V
and FcgRIIa-131H/H genotypes) show increased clinical
responses to rituximab or trastuzumab (7–9). Collectively,
these data support a role for FcgRs and ADCC in the mechanism of action of therapeutic mAbs in vivo, although this
phenomenon has not been directly shown.
The nature of the effector cell type responsible for the ADCC
in vivo is also unclear. Macrophages and neutrophils are
implicated in lymphoma rejection in mouse models using
anti-CD20 mAbs (5, 10). The observed infiltration of breast
cancers by natural killer (NK) cells in trastuzumab-treated
patients suggests a role for this cell type in tumor rejection
(11). In all published studies addressing the question, the
immune system was reported to play a role in the therapeutic
effect of the mAbs analyzed. Nevertheless, the antibodies used
in the vast majority of these studies also have direct effects on
the tumor cells, at least in vitro. Therefore, ADCC is required
for tumor rejection, but we still do not know if it is sufficient.
We have investigated the potential use for immunotherapy
of a mAb directed to the glycopeptidic antigen called Tn, using

Anti-Tn mAb Tumor Immunotherapy through ADCC In Vivo

a mouse model of breast cancer. Tn is formed by a N-acetyl
galactosamine residue (GalNAc) linked by O-glycosylation to
serine or threonine amino acids present in the backbone of
mucin-type glycoproteins (12). The Tn epitope (GalNAc-OSerine/Threonine) is a cryptic determinant not detectable in
normal cells, because it is masked by other sugar residues on
mature saccharide chains. Aberrant protein glycosylation
processes occur in almost 90% of human carcinomas (13–
18), causing incomplete elongation of carbohydrate chains
and unmasking the Tn antigen. Thus, Tn is one of the most
widely expressed and specific tumor-associated antigens
described so far, representing an attractive target for antibody-mediated passive immunotherapy (1, 2).
We now show that a chimeric anti-Tn mAb (Chi-Tn)
recognizing a wide variety of epithelial cancers in both human
and rodents (including breast and ovarian cancer, refs. 14, 19),
has no direct effect on the growth or viability of the mouse
breast cancer cell line TA3Ha in vitro. In vivo, however, Chi-Tn
in association to cyclophosphamide (CTX) induced the rejection of TA3Ha tumors in more than 80% of mice. Tumor
rejection in vivo required the FcR-g chain, indicating that the
therapeutic effects observed depend on ADCC. Indeed, TA3Ha
tumor cells interact in vivo with FcR-gþ macrophages and
neutrophils in Chi-Tn mAb-treated mice, forming an organized multifocal "ADCC synapse" at the contact zone.

Materials and Methods
Cells
TA3Ha (murine breast cancer, given by C. Leclerc, Institut
Pasteur, Paris, France), TA3Ha-GFP (see Supplementary Methods), SKBR3 (human breast cancer, provided by P. de Cremoux, Institut Curie, Paris, France), Jurkat and RAW 264.7
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing glutamax and
10% foetal calf serum. DOHH2 cells (human follicular B
lymphoma) were purchased from DSMZ and cultured in RPMI
1640 containing 5% human AB serum.
Mice
Female BALB/cByJ wild-type mice (7–8 weeks of age) were
obtained from Charles River Laboratories. FcgRIIb/
[C.129S4(B6)-Fcgr2btm1TtK/cAnNTac N12] and FcR gamma
chain-deficient mice [FcR-g /, C.129P2(B6)-Fcer1g tm1Rav
N12] were purchased from Taconic. Experimental procedures
were approved by the French veterinary department.
Antibodies
Rituximab (Mabthera, anti-CD20) and trastuzumab (Herceptin, anti-Her2) were purchased from Hoffmann-La Roche.
The chimeric Chi-Tn mAb described in (20) was produced as
explained in Supplementary Methods. These mAbs were biotinylated (NHS-LC-biotin, Pierce Protein Research Products)
using manufacturer's instructions.
Immunohistochemistry
Ovarian adenocarcinomas and breast cancers samples were
obtained from patients of the Institut Curie, Paris, France.
Tissues sections from paraffin-embedded tumor samples were

labelled with the biotinylated Chi-Tn mAb and avidin coupled
to horseradish peroxidase.
Flow cytometry
Cells were labelled using the indicated antibodies at 20 mg/
mL and with a F(ab0 )2 goat antiserum specific for the human
IgG Fc fragment (GaH-Fc) coupled to phycoerythrin (PE; GaHFc-PE; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), or with streptavidin-PE (Jackson). 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)negative living cells (104) were acquired using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Canto cytometer (BD
Biosciences), and analyzed using the FlowJo software (Tree
Star Inc.).
Ascitis samples (5  106 cells) from ovarian cancer patients
of the Institut Curie were saturated with human immunoglobulins, then labelled with anti-Epcam–FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate), anti-CD45–PerCP–Cy5.5 (both from BD
Biosciences) and biotinylated Chi-Tn mAb plus streptavidine-PE. Living cells (106) were acquired.
For inhibition experiments, the Chi-Tn mAb (20 mg/mL)
was preincubated with synthetic GalNAc, or N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) as control antigen (both from Sigma) at 1
mol/L final concentration for 1 hour at room temperature,
then used for cell labelling as above.
For viability experiments, cells (105) were plated in a 96-W
round bottom plate in the presence of the indicated mAb for
15 minutes on ice. When indicated, unlabelled GaH-Fc (Jackson) was added at 100 mg/mL final concentration to cross-link
Chi-Tn. Cells were then transferred to 37 C for 16 hours,
labelled with propidium iodide (PI), and the percentage of PIpositive cells was determined in the entire cell population (104
cells) by flow cytometry.
Proliferation assays
SKBR3 (5  103) and TA3Ha cells (104) were cultured in a
96-W flat bottom plate with Chi-Tn mAb or trastuzumab for
6 days at 37 C. Cell viability was then assessed by using the
MTS assay (Promega). Results are expressed as a percentage of
inhibition compared with untreated cells.
When indicated, cyclophosphamide (Sigma-Aldrich) or its
active metabolite phosphoramid mustard (PhM, NSC69945,
from the National Cancer Institute/NIH Developmental
Therapeutics Program) were added to the cell culture. Cell
viability was determined using the Alamar Blue assay (Promega) and results are expressed as arbitrary fluorescent
units.
In vivo tumor immunotherapy
Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) on day 0 with 103
TA3Ha tumor cells. The day after graft (day 1), mice were
injected i.p. with CTX at 50 mg/kg or with PBS when indicated.
Starting from day 2 after graft, mice were treated twice a week
with the Chi-Tn mAb or the isotype control antibody (trastuzumab) at 20 mg/kg i.p or with the same volume of PBS (6
total injections). Mice survival was monitored over a 2.5
months period of time; Kaplan–Meier survival curves and
statistical analyses were done by using the log-rank test and
the Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software).

Results
The Chi-Tn mAb specifically labels human breast and
ovarian cancers
The murine anti-Tn mAb (clone 83D4, IgM) recognized
tumor cells from human carcinomas tissue sections but not
the surrounding normal tissue (14, 15, 22). 83D4 strongly
labelled more than 80% of ovarian and breast cancers
(X. Sastre-Garau, unpublished results). Because the pentameric structure of IgM mAbs may impair penetration into
the tumor, and because IgMs do not mediate ADCC, a
chimeric mAb (Chi-Tn mAb) comprising the variable regions
of the murine 83D4 mAb fused to the Fc portion of the human
IgG1 was generated (20).
Figure 1A shows that, similarly to 83D4, the Chi-Tn mAb
strongly labelled primary breast cancers and ovarian serous
adenocarcinoma from patients. More than 80% of ovarian and
breast tumor cells were labelled by the Chi-Tn mAb (top
panel). Tn labelling appeared located in the cytoplasm and at

Anti-Tn mAb Tumor Immunotherapy through ADCC In Vivo

Figure 2. The Chi-Tn mAb does
not affect TA3Ha cell viability or

(squares) or rituximab (circles), in
the presence (open symbols) or
absence (filled symbols) of GaHFc antiserum. Percentages of PIpositive dead cells were

the plasma membrane in both tumors (middle panel). Neither
the healthy ovarian nor breast tissues were labelled with the
Chi-Tn mAb (lower panel).
The Chi-Tn mAb specifically recognizes the Tn antigen
at the plasma membrane of tumor cells
To determine whether the Chi-Tn mAb could be used in
tumor immunotherapy, we analyzed the plasma membrane
expression of the epitope in primary tumor cells from ovarian
cancer ascitis of patients. In 17 of 23 patients examined (74%),
the Chi-Tn mAb labelled the ovarian tumor cells (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Table S1). The labelling was specific for the Tn
antigen, since it was inhibited by soluble GalNAc (Fig. 1B). The
Chi-Tn mAb strongly labelled Jurkat (human T lymphoma)
and TA3Ha (mouse breast cancer) cells, whereas SKBR3
(Her2/neu-positive human breast cancer) and DOHH2
(CD20-positive human B lymphoma) cells were not recognized
(Fig. 1C). Chi-Tn mAb binding to Jurkat and TA3Ha cells is
shown in Supplementary Figure S2. Similarly, Chi-Tn mAb
binding to these tumor cell lines was inhibited by GalNAc, but
not by the control sugar GlcNAc (Fig. 1D). Therefore, Tn is
expressed and accessible at the plasma membrane of fresh
human ovarian cancer cells and of certain human and mouse
tumor cell lines, which can thus be used as model systems to
test the antitumor efficacy of this antibody.
The Chi-Tn mAb does not affect the viability or
proliferation of TA3Ha cells in vitro
Most tumor cell-specific therapeutic mAbs used in the
clinics, including trastuzumab, cetuximab, or rituximab, have
a direct apoptotic or antiproliferative effects on tumor cell
lines in vitro. These direct effects could account, partially or
totally, for their therapeutic efficacy (1, 2). We thus determined whether the Chi-Tn mAb directly affects tumor cell
viability in vitro. As shown in Figure 2A (left panel), moderate
cell cytotoxicity (20%–40% of PIþ dead cells) was observed
when Jurkat cells were treated with high concentrations of
Chi-Tn (50–100 mg/mL). Cross-linking the Chi-Tn mAb with a

www.aacrjournals.org

secondary GaH-Fc antibody strongly increased Jurkat cell
death (5 mg/mL of Chi-Tn inducing 50% of PIþ cells), most
likely by increasing its avidity for Tn (Supplementary Fig. S3).
As expected, the Tn-negative/CD20-positive DOHH2 cell line
was not killed by the Chi-Tn mAb used at any concentration,
although it was killed by the anti-CD20 rituximab (about 40%
of cell death, Fig. 2A, middle panel). In contrast, direct tumor
cell death was not observed for the Tn-expressing breast
tumor cell line TA3Ha using either the Chi-Tn mAb alone
or after cross-linking (Fig. 2A, right panel). The Chi-Tn mAb
did not inhibit TA3Ha cell proliferation, while trastuzumab
induced a 40% inhibition of SKBR3 cell growth (23, Fig. 2B).
Similarly, cross-linked Chi-Tn mAb did not inhibit the proliferation of the Tn-positive human tumor cell lines MCF-7
and SHIN-3 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, the Chi-Tn mAb
did not display any direct apoptotic, or antiproliferative effect
on Tnþ epithelial tumor cells in vitro.
The Chi-Tn mAb associated with CTX inhibits TA3Ha
cell growth in vivo
The efficiency of the Chi-Tn mAb at inhibiting tumor
growth in vivo was assessed in the model of immunocompetent BALB/c mice grafted in the peritoneal cavity with TA3Ha
mouse breast cancer cells. Control mice injected with trastuzumab or PBS rapidly developed ascitis (mean around
day 11 in both cases), and then died (mean survival, 24 days;
range, 15–26 days; Fig. 3A, left panel). Mice treated with the
Chi-Tn mAb did not survive better than control mice (20%
survival, P > 0.05). No sign of general toxicity was observed in
tumor-free mice injected with the Chi-Tn mAb alone (no loss
of weigh, abnormal activity or macroscopic organ lesion, data
not shown).
Synergistic antitumor effects were observed previously
when certain chemotherapies were combined with mAb treatment (24, 25). Moreover, low doses of CTX potentialized
antitumor immune responses induced by immunotherapeutic
treatments in mice, when CTX was given before vaccine
injection (26, 27). Interestingly, as shown in Figure 3A (middle

panel), when mice were given a single injection of CTX (50 mg/
kg) on day 1 after graft and prior Chi-Tn mAb treatment, their
overall survival was highly increased (86% survival, P ¼ 1.8 
1013) compared with mice treated with CTX þ trastuzumab
(as an isotype control, 4% survival). Importantly, survival of
mice treated with CTX alone or CTX þ trastuzumab was
identical to that of mice treated with PBS or trastuzumab
alone (P > 0.05), showing that CTX by itself did not affect
TA3Ha growth in vivo (Fig. 3A, compare left and middle
panels).
The antitumor effects of the Chi-Tn mAb in vivo was dose
dependant. Indeed, survival was decreased when mice were
treated with CTX and a lower dose of Chi-Tn mAb (60% and
100% survival for 10 and 20 mg/kg of Chi-Tn mAb, respectively; Fig. 3A, right panel). Moreover, when the CTX þ Chi-Tn
mAb treatment was delayed (CTX injected on day 4 and ChiTn mAb injections starting from day 5), the survival of treated
mice was still increased compared with control mice (Fig. 3B,
P ¼ 0.0007). In addition, when mice previously treated and
cured by CTX þ Chi-Tn mAb treatment were rechallenged

5138

with TA3Ha cells i.p. after 75 days, more than 90% of the mice
were resistant to this second graft (Fig. 3C), most likely due to
an adaptative antitumor memory response. Taken together,
these results show that the Chi-Tn mAb prevented the growth
of TA3Ha cells when associated to CTX, in the absence of any
apparent sign of toxicity.
To investigate a possible direct toxic effect of the CTX þ
Chi-Tn association on TA3Ha cells, we used the CTX liveractive metabolite, PhM. A single injection of CTX at 20 to
60 mg/kg to rodents or humans induced a peak of 20 to
30 mmol/L PhM in the plasma after 30 minutes to 1 hour,
which then decreased rapidly (PhM half-life about 50 minutes,
refs. 28, 29). PhM was not directly toxic for TA3Ha cells in vitro
for concentrations up to 50 mmol/L (Fig. 3D, left panel).
Moreover (Fig. 3D, middle panel), no synergistic antiproliferative effect was found when TA3Ha cells were cultured with
Chi-Tn and PhM (concentration up to 50 mmol/L). In addition,
when TA3Ha cells, precultured with PhM (0.5 mmol/L; or 30
mmol/L, not shown), were stimulated using Chi-Tn mAb crosslinked with a GaH-Fc antibody, no cell death was observed

Anti-Tn mAb Tumor Immunotherapy through ADCC In Vivo

(Fig. 3D, right panel). Similar results were obtained when
TA3Ha cells were cultured simultaneously with CTX or
PhM, Chi-Tn and GaH-Fc (not shown). Finally, PhM did not
sensitize TA3Ha cell death by Chi-Tn-mediated ADCC in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. S5). These results show that Chi-Tn, even
upon cross-linking and in the presence of CTX, has no toxic
effects on TA3Ha cells, suggesting that the tumor inhibition
observed in vivo is not due to a direct effect of the Chi-Tn mAb
on tumor cells.
The Chi-Tn mAb kills TA3Ha cells by ADCC in vitro, and
rejects TA3Ha cells through activating FcgR in vivo
Because the Chi-Tn mAb did not inhibit directly the growth
of TA3Ha cells in vitro, we investigated if it could induce tumor
cell death by ADCC (Ref. 21, and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Figure 4A shows that the Chi-Tn mAb, but not an isotype
control, induced the lysis of TA3Ha cells incubated with RAW
(a macrophage cell line) as effector cells. Therefore, the Chi-Tn
mAb mediates ADCC in vitro.
FcgRs were showed to play a role in the antitumor effect
induced by different therapeutic mAbs in several mouse
models of cancer (4, 5). We therefore examined whether these
receptors were involved in the protective antitumor effect
mediated by CTX þ Chi-Tn mAb in vivo. The inhibitory
FcgRIIB enhanced the antitumor effect of trastuzumab and
rituximab in murine xenograft tumor models (4). In the
present experimental model, treatment with CTX þ Chi-Tn
mAb induced the same level of protection in both TA3Hagrafted FcgRIIb/ and wild-type BALB/c mice (80% survival
in each case, P ¼ 0.937, compare Fig. 4B, left and middle
panels). In addition, FcgRIIb/ mice-bearing TA3Ha cells did
not survive better than wild-type mice upon treatment with
Chi-Tn mAb alone (20% and 0% survival respectively, P ¼
0.537, compare Fig. 4B, left and middle panels), and their
survival was similar to CTX þ PBS-injected control mice in

both strains. We concluded that FcgRIIB did not influence the
antitumor effect mediated by the Chi-Tn mAb in this tumor
model.
The activating FcgR, responsible for ADCC in vitro, were
shown to contribute substantially to antibody-mediated
tumor growth inhibition in vivo, since the antitumor effect
of rituximab and trastuzumab were impaired in mice deficient
for the FcR-g chain (FcR-g / mice), which lack functional
FcgRI, FcgRIII, and FcgRIV (4, 5). The survival of FcRg–deficient mice grafted with TA3Ha cells and treated with
CTX þ Chi-Tn was dramatically decreased compared with
wild-type mice (20% and 80% survival respectively, P ¼ 0.02,
compare Fig. 4B, left and right panels), and did not differed
from control FcR-g / mice injected with CTX þ PBS (Fig. 4B,
right panel, 20% and 0% survival respectively, P ¼ 0.373). These
results show that activating FcgRs play a critical role in the
therapeutic antitumor effect of CTX þ Chi-Tn mAb, supporting a role for ADCC in tumor rejection induced by Chi-Tn.
TA3Ha cells form conjugates in vivo with effectors of the
tumor microenvironment after CTX þ Chi-Tn mAb
treatment
To further investigate the mechanisms of Chi-Tn mAbinduced tumor rejection in vivo, BALB/c mice were given
TA3Ha-GFPþ cells on day 0, CTX on day 1, and then Chi-Tn
mAb or trastuzumab on day 2. Four hours after mAb injection,
peritoneal cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 5A, Tn-positive TA3Ha-GFPþ cells
from Chi-Tn mAb but not from trastuzumab-treated mice
were labelled with the secondary GaH-Fc-PE antibody, showing that the Chi-Tn mAb was bound to the plasma membrane
of TA3Ha cells in vivo. Analysis of these peritoneal infiltrates
by deconvolution microscopy showed conjugates between
GFPþ tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment
in CTX þ Chi-Tn-treated mice, but not in control mice

(106/mouse) on day 0. PBS or CTX (50 mg/kg) was given on day 1, and Chi-Tn mAb (n ¼ 3) or trastuzumab (n ¼ 3) were injected at 20 mg/kg on day 2. Peritoneal

injected with trastuzumab (Fig. 5B top panels and Fig. 5C).
F-Actin accumulated at the interface between host peritoneal
cells and tumor cells suggesting synapse formation in vivo.
Macrophages (F4/80þ) and neutrophil/polymorphonuclear
cells (Ly6Gþ), as well as B cells (CD19þ), were found in
conjugation with tumor cells, at a mean frequency around
30% for each cell type (Fig. 5C). No interactions with tumor
cells were observed for NK cells (DX5þ), T cells (CD3þ),
dendritic cells (CD11cþ), nor mastocytes or basophils (FceRIþ;
data not shown).
Orthogonal projections of the contact zone between potential effectors and GFPþ tumor cells showed that F-actin was
reorganized into dense-punctuated structures across the
interfaces, with one or several small zones with no F-actin
(see the representative "en face" vues in Fig. 5C), forming what
has been referred to as "actin rings," similarly to immunologic
T-cell synapses (30). In addition, FcgRIII, one of the most likely
effectors of ADCC, accumulated at the interface within the
actin "wholes" (Fig. 6A and B). FcR-g chain and FcgRIIB were
also present at the interface but did not accumulate in this
zone (Fig. 6A). The marked accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins at the interface suggested that active
signaling was occurring between the 2 cells. We also
observed the polarization of LAMP-1þ vesicles near the

5140

interface, again suggesting that these structures represent
functional cytotoxic synapses (Fig. 6C). Thus, organized
macromolecular structures formed at the interface between
ADCC effector cells and tumors cells upon injection of the
Chi-Tn mAb. These structures are organized in central and
peripheral supra-molecular activation clusters (SMAC) that,
by analogy to the structures formed at the interface between
T cells and antigen-presenting cells, could be called "ADCC
synapses."
Interestingly, conjugates between tumor cells and macrophages, neutrophils, or B cells could still be observed in FcRg–deficient mice (lacking activating FcgR) after CTX þ Chi-Tn
mAb treatment, probably because of the engagement of the
inhibitory FcgRIIB present on these effector cells. Synapses
between tumor and effector cells were also present in wildtype mice treated with Chi-Tn mAb in the absence of CTX
(Fig. 5B lower panels, and Supplementary Fig. S6). Under these
2 last experimental conditions, no antitumor effect was
observed (see Fig. 3A and Fig. 4B), indicating that the
cross-linking of the Chi-Tn mAb is not by itself sufficient to
induce tumor cell death in vivo (activation of the effector cells
is required).
We conclude that macrophages and neutrophils are the 2
main cytotoxic cell types that mediated Chi-Tn-induced

Anti-Tn mAb Tumor Immunotherapy through ADCC In Vivo

Figure 6. Analysis of the ADCC synapse between TA3Ha and immune
cells. Mice were grafted with TA3Ha-GFPþ cells, injected with CTX and
treated with Chi-Tn mAb or trastuzumab as in Figure 5. Peritoneal cells
were labelled 4 hours after mAb injection using the indicated 1st Ab (red)
against: FcR-g chain, phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr), FcgRIII or FcgRIIb (A) or
LAMP-1 (C), and phalloidin (yellow). Green, TA3Ha-GFP cells; blue, DAPI.

marker. B, synapses between FcgRIIIþ cells and TA3Ha-GFPþ cells were

TA3Ha rejection by ADCC, and that ADCC in vivo occurs
through organized ADCC synapses that form at the interface
between effectors and tumor cells.

Discussion
The relative contribution of direct growth inhibition, indirect cytotoxicity (ADCC or CDC) and adaptive immunity (2, 6,
31) in the therapeutic effect of mAbs is still a matter of
sustained investigation. We show here that a mAb (Chi-Tn)

www.aacrjournals.org

induced tumor rejection in vivo through ADCC, in the absence
of any detectable direct effect on tumor growth in vitro.
The Chi-Tn mAb is specific for the GalNAc-O-Ser or Thr
epitope expressed on various proteins of the mucin family in
both humans and mice carcinomas (12, 27). Distinct anti-Tn
mAbs display differences in their fine specificity (the binding is
affected by the density of the Tn determinant or/and by the
amino acid residues neighboring O-glycosylation sites) and
show different cancer recognition patterns and variable
effects on tumor growth (16, 32–36). With the exception of
Jurkat T cells, the Chi-Tn mAb did not affect the growth of any
of the Tn-expressing tumor cells tested, particularly the breast
tumor cell line TA3Ha that was used here (Fig. 2, and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Chi-Tn-induced tumor rejection in vivo required pretreatment of mice with CTX. TA3Ha cells were insensitive to PhM
(the active metabolite of CTX) in vitro (28, 29, Fig. 3D), and in
vivo (Fig. 3A). It is unclear thus far by which mechanism CTX
participated to the antitumor effect of the Chi-Tn mAb in vivo.
PhM did not potentiate Chi-Tn to induce TA3Ha cell death or
ADCC in vitro (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S5). The other
hypothesis is that CTX modified the host microenvironment
favoring the antitumor effect of Chi-Tn. Indeed, CTX induces
the release of cytokines from bone marrow cells (37, 38), which
could activate ADCC effectors, thereby promoting tumor
rejection. This idea is strengthened by the results in Figure
5B and Supplementary Figure S6, showing that synapses are
not sufficient by themselves in the absence of CTX to induce
tumor cell death.
Tumor growth inhibition by the CTX þ Chi-Tn mAb combination in vivo needed activating FcgR (Fig. 4B). Similarly, to the
FcR-g chain-dependent antitumor effect of rituximab and
trastuzumab (4–6), Chi-Tn mAb cross-linking was not sufficient
to kill TA3Ha cells in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 2A, 3A, and 5B and
Supplementary Fig. S6). Instead, our results suggest that TA3Ha
cells are eliminated upon CTX þ Chi-Tn mAb treatment
through FcR-g chain-dependant ADCC (Figs. 4–6). Moreover,
no enhanced response to Chi-Tn mAb alone was observed in
FcgRIIB-deficient mice, as compared with wild-type (WT) mice
(Fig. 4B), contrary to that was described for rituximab and
trastuzumab (4). This result suggests that the CTX pretreatment
used here may overcome the negative effect of FcgRIIB in vivo.
No direct demonstration that ADCC occurs in vivo was
reported so far. Indirect evidence showing an infiltration of
the tumors by FcgRþ lymphoïd cells in patients treated with
trastuzumab was only reported (11). In this study, we show for
the first time that hematopoietic cells were conjugated to tumor
cells in vivo in Chi-Tn but not in control trastuzumab-treated
mice. 3D deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy
showed that the interface between the 2 cells was organized
into SMACs, defining what could be referred to as "ADCC
synapses" in vivo. This study represents one of the few direct
demonstrations of the existence of immune synapses in vivo.
The analysis of these conjugates also identified the nature of the
effector cells involved in tumor rejection through ADCC in vivo.
Surprisingly, no NK cells were found in the conjugates, while F4/
80þ macrophages, Ly6Gþ neutrophils and CD19þ B cells were
present in the same proportion in the doublets. Macrophages

and neutrophils were already reported to mediate tumor cell
killing through ADCC and synapse formation between these
effectors and tumor cells was shown in vitro (39, 40). Moreover,
B cells were also suggested to be necessary for tumor growth
inhibition in vivo (41).
Chemotherapies synergize with therapeutic mAbs (24, 25)
by interfering with DNA-repair processes (42), by increasing
CTL-mediated tumor cell lysis (43), or decreasing regulatory T
cells (44). Moreover, some reports (26, 31) showed that the
timings of chemotherapy and mAb injections are important
for the duration of the antitumor response. Our model using
CTX before Chi-Tn mAb treatment reinforce this idea, suggesting that a tumor-specific memory response may also be
involved in the CTX þ Chi-Tn mAb antitumor effect.
