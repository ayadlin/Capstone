BACKGROUND. Patients older than 75 years of age are usually excluded from metastatic colorectal cancer randomized studies. The OPTIMOX1 study evaluated
FOLFOX7, a simplified (s) leucovorin (LV) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) regimen
(sLV5FU2) with high-dose oxaliplatin, in a new oxaliplatin stop-and-go strategy.
An exploratory cohort of patients aged 76 to 80 years was included in the study.

METHODS. In all, 620 previously untreated patients were randomized between
FOLFOX4 until progression (arm A), or FOLFOX7 for 6 cycles, maintenance without oxaliplatin for 12 cycles, and reintroduction of FOLFOX7 (arm B).

RESULTS. A total of 37 patients aged 76 to 80 years were included, 20 in arm A and
17 in arm B. The overall response rate (ORR) was 59.4%, comparable to younger
patients (59%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.0 months and median
overall survival (OS) was 20.7 months. These results did not differ from that in
younger patients 75 years in the OPTIMOX1 study with PFS 9.0 months (P 5 .63)

olorectal cancer (CRC) is 1 of the most common malignancies
and the second cause of cancer deaths in the US and most European countries. Its incidence has been increasing in the last decade, primarily as a consequence of the aging of the population.1 In
Europe >40% of new CRCs are diagnosed in patients older than
75 years.2,3 In the US the incidence of CRC is 250 per 100 000 at
75 years and 310 per 100 000 at 80 years.3 In the elderly population
the frequent incidence of other age-related comorbidities such as
impaired renal, cardiac, and liver function, general decline in health,
loss of autonomy, and cognitive impairment can all impact the ther-

apeutic decision, especially when the patient’s family
and physician are involved.4,5 Moreover, in a palliative context some elderly patients would prefer immediate relief and a comfortable quality of life to
potentially toxic chemotherapy or a clinical trial.6
One study reported that fewer than 50% of elderly
patients aged older than 65 years with advanced CRC
received systemic chemotherapy.7
Given the great importance of the elderly population in CRC, it is important to assess systematically
the management of elderly CRC patients with modern chemotherapeutic regimens. Unfortunately, elderly patients are usually excluded from randomized
studies.8 Up to now, no randomized phase 3 study
has accurately compared the effect of therapy
between young and elderly patients, and there has
not even been a standard definition of the elderly
patient, with the age limit fixed variably between 65
and 75 years. Only phase 2 or retrospective studies
have addressed the issue of elderly patients with
advanced CRC. Two studies have shown that palliative 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy could
be performed in elderly patients (>74 years) without
increasing toxicity or morbidity, while obtaining
response rates and survival (14–17 months) comparable to those of younger patients.9,10 Another study
has shown that combination therapy with 5FU and
oxaliplatin or irinotecan was active, with manageable
toxicity in patients older than 74 years.11
A new high-dose stop-and-go strategy FOLFOX7
regimen14,15 has been investigated in the OPTIMOX1
study in comparison to the FOLFOX4 regimen12,13
and the results are now published.16
To investigate response rates, median progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of
older patients to both FOLFOX regimens, an exploratory cohort of patients aged 76 to 80 years was
included in the OPTIMOX1 study. The results in this
patient cohort are reported here.

chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients older
than 75 years of age (reported here) or patients with
alkaline phosphatase over 3 upper limit of normal
(UNL) constituted an exploratory cohort.
Patients were randomized between FOLFOX4 (leucovorin 200 mg/m2 followed by 5FU bolus 400 mg/m2
and 22-hour infusion 600 mg/m2 on 2 consecutive days
with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on Day 1) every 2 weeks
(arm A), or FOLFOX7 (leucovorin 400 mg/m2 followed
by a 5FU 46-hour infusion 2400 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin
130 mg/m2 on Day 1, every 2 weeks) for 6 cycles, maintenance with 12 cycles of simplified LV5FU2, and reintroduction of FOLFOX7 for 6 cycles (arm B).
In both arms the treatment was continued until
progression on FOLFOX therapy, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient chose to discontinue. In the case
of progression during sLV5FU2 alone and sensory
neuropathy <grade 2, reintroduction of oxaliplatin
was scheduled in arm B and allowed in arm A.
Evaluation with physical examination, blood
count, liver and renal function tests, and computedtomography (CT) scans was performed at baseline,
after 4 cycles, 6 cycles, and then every 6 cycles.
The primary assessment criterion for the overall
OPTIMOX1 study was time to treatment failure or duration of disease control (DDC).16 Secondary assessments were PFS, OS, response rates, and tolerance, all
of which were assessed in the elderly cohort.
In the OPTIMOX1 study16 randomization was
performed using a minimization technique,17 stratifying patients by center, performance status, number
of metastatic sites involved, age, and baseline alkaline phosphatase. The randomization was stratified
so as to ensure a reasonable treatment balance for
prognostic factor values that usually make patients
ineligible (age >75 years and baseline alkaline phosphatase >3 3 ULN). The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to estimate survival and PFS curves and the
log-rank test was used to compare the curves.18 The
cutoff date for the final analysis was October 1, 2004.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
OPTIMOX1 was an international multicentric randomized study. A detailed description of patient selection, chemotherapy with dose adaptation, evaluation
criteria, and statistical considerations have been previously reported in the main OPTIMOX1 study.16
The principal characteristics of patients included
were: adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum; unresectable metastases; at least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion of 1 cm or a nonmeasurable evaluable
lesion; adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function; World Health Organization (WHO) performance
status (PS) of 0 to 2; age 18 to 80 years; no peripheral
sensory neuropathy at inclusion; and no previous

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
In total, 37 patients were older than 75 years in the
OPTIMOX1 study. Their median age was 77 years
(range, 76–80). Twenty patients were randomly
assigned to arm A and 17 to arm B. Patients characteristics are reported in Table 1. Six (16%) patients
had a performance status of 2. Five patients (14%)
had an alkaline phosphatase level more than 3 times
the ULN. Twenty-seven (73%) patients had only 1
metastatic site, usually in the liver (65%). The most
common comorbidities were hypertension (17 patients, 46%), other severe cardiovascular disease (4

patients, 11%), and other cardiovascular or related
metabolic diseases such as vasculitis, phlebitis, and
diabetes (11 patients, 30%).

Treatment Cycles and Dose Intensity
In total, the patients in the elderly cohort received
469 cycles of treatment, including 307 cycles with
oxaliplatin. The median number of cycles was 12
(range, 2–51) for all patients, 10 (2–19) in arm A and
16 (2–51) in arm B. The median number of cycles
with oxaliplatin was 9 (range, 2–18) in arm A and 6
(2–7) in arm B.
In arm A 16 (80%) patients received at least 6
cycles of FOLFOX4 in first-line therapy. In arm B 13
(76%) patients received the 6 planned cycles of FOLFOX7. In patients who received 6 cycles the median
oxaliplatin dose-intensity was 38 mg/m2/week (89%
of the planned dose) in arm A and 50 mg/m2/week
in arm B (77% of the planned dose). These results
are very similar in patients 75 years (89% and 77%
of the oxaliplatin planned dose in arm A and B,
respectively).
In arm A the median dose intensity of 5FU bolus
was 362 mg/m2/week (90% of the planned dose) and
of 5FU infusion 500 mg/m2/week (83% of the planned
dose). In arm B the median dose-intensity of 5FU
infusion was 1000 mg/m2/week (83% of the planned
dose).
Responses
Thirty-five patients were assessable for response. The
overall response rate (ORR: complete response [CR] 1
partial response [PR]) was 59.5% for all patients
(range, 43.4%–75.6%), 65% in arm A and 53% in arm
B. In addition, 29.7% of all patients had stable disease
(SD) and only 5.4% progressive disease (PD).

FIGURE 2. Overall survival. Patients >75 years versus patients 75

Response rates of patients from 76 to 80 years are
comparable to results found for younger patients in
the OPTIMOX1 study (ORR: 59%, range, 55.1%–62.9%,
SD: 28%, PD: 10%).
Following response to chemotherapy, a metastasis surgery was performed in 6 patients >75 years
and the resection was complete for 4 of them (R0
resection).
Five patients in arm B (29%) had a per-protocol
oxaliplatin reintroduction. Of these, 1 had a partial
response, another stable disease, and 3 progressed
after oxaliplatin reintroduction.

Progression-Free and Overall Survival
Median PFS was 9.0 months for all patients, 7.6 months in arm A and 9.4 months in arm B. Median OS was
20.7 months for all patients, 14.0 months in arm A and
25.1 months in arm B. Survival curves are shown in
Figures 1 and 2.

PFS indicates progression-free survival; OS, overall survival.

As with tumor response rates, PFS and OS in the
elderly cohort did not differ from that in younger
patients in the OPTIMOX1 study (respectively, 9.0
months, P 5 .63, and 20.2 months, P 5 .57) (Figs. 1, 2).
Twenty-one patients died of CRC, 1 of pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, 1 of a cerebrovascular event, 1 of myocardial infarction, 1 of postsurgical
complication, and 1 from an unknown cause. The
remaining 11 patients >75 years were alive at the
cutoff date.

Additional Therapeutic Lines
Twenty-six patients (70%) received a second-line
treatment, of which 13 received an irinotecan-based
regimen. One partial response and 3 stabilizations
were observed. Ten patients received a third-line and
2 a fourth-line treatment. Comparatively, about 75%
of patients younger than 75 years received a secondline treatment in the OPTIMOX1 study.
Safety
Grade 3–4 toxicity occurred in 65% of patients (Table 2). The main toxicities were neutropenia, which
occurred in 41% of patients, 11 patients in arm A
(55%) and 4 patients in arm B (24%), and sensory neurotoxicity attributed to oxaliplatin, which was
observed in 8 patients (22%), 4 in each arm. Only 1
patient in arm A was hospitalized for febrile neutropenia. A total of 17 patients (46%) had a dose reduction
due to toxicity-related or unrelated to oxaliplatin,
including 11 in arm A (55%) and 6 in arm B (35%).
In comparison to younger patients, as shown in
Table 3, elderly patients experienced more neutropenia (41% vs 24%, P 5 .03), neurotoxicity (22 vs 11%,
P 5 .06), and overall grade 3–4 toxicity (65% vs 48%,
P 5 .06). However, tolerability was manageable and
no toxic death occurred in any group of older
patients >75 years.

DISCUSSION
In this small and selected but randomized and genuinely elderly population, chemotherapy with both
FOLFOX4 and stop-and-go FOLFOX7 demonstrated
high activity in the treatment of advanced CRC,
with response rates, PFS, and OS comparable to
those observed in younger patients (Table 2). These
results are impressive, but caution should be exercised in extrapolating them to elderly patients in
general. Not only was the cohort small in number,
but in addition the general health of the participants selected to be included in the clinical trial
was comparatively good: although two-thirds had at
least 1 comorbidity, only 16% had a performance
status of 2. To fully evaluate therapy in elderly
patients, more specific evaluations will be necessary,19 although this was not feasible within the setting of this large randomized study.
The results of this cohort study are consistent
with previous findings that chemotherapy is active
in elderly patients with advanced CRC. Leucovorin
and 5FU have achieved response rates between 20%
and 44%, median PFS between 5.5 and 8.8 months,
and median survival between 10.8 and 16.4 months.9,10,20–22 Raltitrexed was reported to achieve a
response rate of 22%, with a median PFS of 3.5 months
and OS of 9.5 months.23 In most studies, even if the
definition of elderly patients included younger
patients, age was not usually found to be an independent prognostic factor.20,24 Polychemotherapy has not
been extensively studied.11 In this study the results
achieved, including a response rate of 59%, a median
PFS of 9 months, and a median OS of more than
20 months, suggest that FOLFOX has an improved efficacy in patients older than 76 years as in younger
patients.
The toxicity of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in elderly patients appears manageable,

2670

especially with 5FU-infusion regimens.10,21,22 Specific
concerns about safety have emerged with 5FU bolus
regimens or raltitrexed in patients with impaired renal function.23,25,26 Elderly patients treated with irinotecan as single agent second-line therapy did not
experience more toxicity than younger patients,27 but
in cases of combination chemotherapy in which
oxaliplatin or irinotecan were given with 5FU or raltitrexed, 42% of patients aged >75 years experienced
grade 3 or 4 toxicity.11
In our study, therapeutic compliance of patients
aged >75 years was good. With comparable duration
of treatment and dose intensity achieved, elderly
patients experienced only slightly more toxicity than
younger patients, including the 2 most common side
effects of FOLFOX, neutropenia and sensory neuropathy (Table 3). However, there were no deaths due to
FOLFOX.
Our results are confirmed by a recent retrospective pooled analysis in a large number of older
patients >70 years, where FOLFOX4 had efficacy and
safety, except with a few more adverse events without outcome modifications, comparable to younger
patients.28 In that study the comparison was done
between patients aged under or older than 70 years
but only a few of them were older than 76 years
(13.5%). Our study more specifically concerned
patients older than 76 years, with similar results of
FOLFOX efficacy and tolerability.
The comparison of the 2 arms in such a small
subset of the treated population is not relevant,
although their efficacy was similar. The general conclusions of the OPTIMOX1 study can, however, be
extrapolated to elderly patients, namely, that the 2
arms had a similar activity but that convenience
and tolerability favored the OPTIMOX1 strategy (6
cycles of FOLFOX7 followed by sLV5FU2). In this
analysis the OPTIMOX1 strategy, which allows a
greater median number of cycles (10 in arm A vs 16
in arm B), is as safe and efficient for patients older
than 76 years as for younger patients. Toxicity could
be further decreased using a reduced oxaliplatin
dose intensity. The convenience of safety and the
stop-and-go strategy are important issues in this
population.
In conclusion, performance status and geriatric
assessment are surely better criteria than age to predict the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy. The
results of this study support our belief that the
increasing population of elderly patients >75 years,
with appropriate motivation and performance status,
benefit from FOLFOX regimens to a similar degree as
younger individuals, and consequently that this treatment can be offered to these patients.
