ABSTRACT
Background: CRC is a significant cause of cancer mortality, and new therapies are
needed for patients with advanced disease. TAK-733 is a highly potent and selective
investigational novel MEK allosteric site inhibitor.
Materials and Methods: In a preclinical study of TAK-733, a panel of CRC cell
lines were exposed to varying concentrations of the agent for 72 hours followed by a
sulforhodamine B assay. Twenty patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts were
then treated with TAK-733 in vivo. Tumor growth inhibition index (TGII) was assessed
to evaluate the sensitivity of the CRC explants to TAK-733 while linear regression
was utilized to investigate the predictive effects of genotype on the TGII of explants.
Results: Fifty-four CRC cell lines were exposed to TAK-733, while 42 cell lines
were deemed sensitive across a broad range of mutations. Eighty-two percent of the
cell lines within the sensitive subset were BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutant, whereas
80% of the cell lines within the sensitive subset were PIK3CA WT. Twenty patientderived human tumor CRC explants were then treated with TAK-733. In total, 15
primary human tumor explants were found to be sensitive to TAK-733 (TGII ≤ 20%),
including 9 primary human tumor explants that exhibited tumor regression (TGII >
100%). Explants with a BRAF/KRAS/NRAS mutant and PIK3CA wild-type genotype
demonstrated increased sensitivity to TAK-733 with a median TGII of -6%. MEKresponse gene signatures also correlated with responsiveness to TAK-733 in KRASmutant CRC.
Conclusions: The MEK inhibitor TAK-733 demonstrated robust antitumor activity
against CRC cell lines and patient-derived tumor explants. While the preclinical activity
observed in this study was considerable, single-agent efficacy in the clinic has been
limited in CRC, supporting the use of these models in an iterative manner to elucidate
resistance mechanisms that can guide rational combination strategies.

INTRODUCTION

(EGFR). Once the receptor is activated, it serves to
activate membrane bound RAS which can then recruit
RAF to the membrane. RAS thus serves as a critical link
between growth factor receptors and initiation of signal
transduction. RAS proteins are comprised of 4 major
forms, HRAS, NRAS, and 2 forms of KRAS while
RAF includes three kinase family members, ARAF,
BRAF, and CRAF. The complexity of RAF activation
is increased by additional non-RAS signaling activities

The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway
is a major contributor to cell growth and survival and
is frequently dysregulated in numerous cancers [6, 9].
Signaling through the MAPK pathway is known to be
complex with numerous downstream effector signaling
pathways and can be initiated by several growth factor
receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor

including phosphorylation (p21 activated kinase) and
dephosphorylation (protein phosphatase 2A) that are
required to fully activate RAF function. RAF function is
also regulated by interactions with other proteins including
14-3-3 proteins and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) [1].
RAF activation leads to its binding with a scaffoldlike protein complex in the cytoplasm that allows it to
physically locate near the vicinity of MEK1/2. MEK1 and
2 have only one known substrate, ERK [2], whereas ERK1
and ERK 2 are known to have over 160 different targets
including cytosolic proteins and numerous transcription
factors [3]. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade is a
central signaling pathway required for normal cellular
proliferation and transformation, and MEK has been
shown to be integral in the development and progression
of colorectal cancer [4].
Due to the frequent aberration of this signaling
cascade in malignant tissues, MEK has emerged as an
attractive target in cancer. Inhibition of MEK impairs
proliferation and affects a diverse array of cellular events
including differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis [5,
6]. MEK is a validated target in several malignancies,
including non-small lung cancer and melanoma with
selumetinib and trametinib respectively [7, 8]. MEK
inhibitors have also shown promise in preclinical studies
of KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutant colorectal cancer, but early
phase clinical trials with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib
(AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) failed to demonstrate
significant improvement in progression-free survival [9,
10].
MEK1/2 (MAP2K1/K2), the canonical targets of
MEK inhibitors, are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine
kinases that are integral in the activation of the RAS/
RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a
variety of tumor cell types. TAK-733 is a highly potent
and selective novel MEK allosteric site inhibitor with an
IC50 of 3.2 nM that selectively binds to and inhibits the
activity of MEK1/2, preventing the activation of MEK1/2dependent effector proteins and transcription factors.
TAK-733 has demonstrated potent anticancer activity in
several solid tumor mouse xenograft models and exhibited
potent enzymatic and cell activity with an EC50 of 1.9 nM
against ERK phosphorylation, the downstream target
within the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, in cells [11,
12].
In this study, the antitumor activity of TAK-733 was
assessed against colorectal cancer cell lines and patientderived tumor xenografts (PDX). Given the known
resistance mechanisms of MEK inhibition in colorectal
cancer, we hypothesized that tumors with known KRAS/
NRAS or BRAF mutations that were PIK3CA wild-type
would exhibit greater sensitivity to MEK inhibition [13].

Effects of TAK-733 on proliferation of colorectal
cancer cell lines
Initially, a panel of 54 CRC cell lines was exposed
to TAK-733 to establish the IC50s. As depicted in Figure
1, 54 CRC cell lines were segregated into highly sensitive
(IC50 ≤ 0.03µM) or highly resistant (IC50 > 1µM). Of the
54 cell lines, 42 (77%) were classified as sensitive to TAK733. Cell lines with a KRAS/NRAS or BRAF mutation
were associated with sensitivity to TAK-733 (p = 0.03),
and even greater sensitivity was observed in 14 of 17 CRC
cell lines that were KRAS/NRAS mutant and PIK3CA
wild-type.

Effects of TAK-733 on CRC cell lines by
immunoblotting
The effects of TAK-733 on the modulation of
downstream targets in the MAPK and PI3K pathways
were analyzed in 2 sensitive and 4 resistant cell lines
(Figure 2). As observed by us and others in prior studies,
inhibition of p-ERK was observed in both S and R cell
lines, with only one of the R cell lines (LS123) exhibiting
inhibition at only the higher (1.25uM) concentration
[14-16]. Interestingly, there was evidence of increased
p-AKT after exposure to TAK-733 in one of the R cell
lines (Colo741). Two additional TAK-733 R cell lines
were evaluated, and one R cell line was found to have an
increase in p-AKT (LS123) (Supplemental Figure 1). An
increase in p-AKT was also observed in one of the S cell
lines (LOVO).

MEK pathway inhibition by TAK-733 in patientderived CRC xenografts
To further investigate this agent, we conducted
in vivo experiments in patient-derived CRC xenograft
models (PDX). Based on our in vitro results, we assessed
the ability of this molecular classifier: BRAF MUT (any
PI3K), or KRAS/NRAS MUT and PI3K WT to predict
responsiveness to TAK-733 in 20 CRC PDXs (Figure 3).
To do this, we selected more clinically relevant criteria
for categorizing the PDX as “responsive” or “resistant”,
requiring the tumor growth inhibition index to be ≤
20% to score a PDX as “responsive” while a TGII >
20% was classified as “resistant”. Table 1 depicts the
mutational status of the PDX. Overall, there was a 75%
TGII “response rate” with 15 responders using the criteria
described above. There was a trend towards greater TGII
in PDXs that were KRAS/BRAF mutant and PIK3CA
wild-type. Notably, of the 12 KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutant

disease or partial response per TGII criteria. Interestingly,
of the 8 PDXs that demonstrated tumor regression, 6
(75%) were KRAS/BRAF mutant and PIK3CA wild-type,

The other biomarkers assessed were quite variable such
as survivin, which was paradoxically decreased in the
two non-responsive tumors and increased in one of the
sensitive tumors, perhaps confounded by its assessment at
the end of study. Next tumor samples from a responsive
PDX (CUCRC 102) collected at the end of study were
evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). As depicted
in Figure 5, after treatment with TAK-733, this PDX
demonstrated the expected decrease in p-ERK with an
increase in caspase 3. Similar results were observed in
IHC stains performed on CUCRC102.

Development of a MEK-sensitivity signature for
KRAS mutant CRC

11 KRAS mutant PDX models treated with TAK-733,
7 and 4 models were predicted as sensitive or resistant,
respectively (Table 3). The MEK signature correctly
predicted 8 out of the 11 PDX models (accuracy 73%)
in TAK-733 sensitivity. The sensitivity and specificity of
the MEK signature to TAK-733 are 86% (6/8) and 67%
(2/3), respectively. We also tested the published KRASdependency signature against these 11 PDX models, and
this signature achieved 64% accuracy in predicting TAK733 sensitivity. The KRAS-dependency signature has 83%
and 40% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. When
we tested the MEK signature against the eight KRAS
wild-type and one BRAF mutant PDX models treated
with TAK-733, the prediction accuracy was only 44%,
suggesting that the MEK signature is only predictive for
KRAS mutant CRC (Table 4).

As KRAS mutation is a negative predictor for
EGFR-based therapy for CRC patients, novel therapeutics
are urgently needed for this population. Recent studies
have suggested that the KRAS-mutant cancer cell
lines, including CRC could be divided into two groups
based on their “KRAS-dependency” [17, 18]. Based on
the observation that the presence of a KRAS mutation
was associated with sensitivity to a wide-range of
MEK inhibitors including TAK-733 in CRC, but was
insufficient for prediction alone, we reasoned that gene
expression changes within this subset might enable better
prediction of responsiveness to MEK inhibition. To test
this, we focused on 11 KRAS mutant CRC cell lines
that have been tested in our laboratory and demonstrated
consistent sensitivity or resistance across four different
MEK inhibitors [TAK-733, AZD6244 [19], PD-0325901
[20] and U0126 [21]] (Table 2). Using SAM analysis, we
identified 201 probe sets that were differentially expressed
in MEK inhibitor sensitive or resistant cell lines. To
test whether these probe sets were predictive in KRAS
mutant PDX models, we performed cluster analysis on
the common 117 probe sets found between the cell lines
and PDX models from two different platforms. From the

DISCUSSION
TAK-733 is a highly potent and selective novel
MEK allosteric site inhibitor and selectively binds to
and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the antitumor activity of TAK-733
in colorectal cancer cell lines and PDX models. We also
developed a MEK-sensitivity signature based on four
different MEK inhibitors from colorectal cancer cell lines
and evaluated the predictivity of this signature in TAK-

733 sensitivity in PDX models. As the results demonstrate,
TAK-733 exhibited significant activity against colorectal
cancer cell lines and PDX models, supporting inhibition
of this pathway as a therapeutic strategy in CRC, with the
caveat that better prediction is needed for single agent use,
or the development of rational combinations.
Prior clinical studies with an earlier generation MEK
inhibitor, selumetinib, failed to demonstrate significant
improvements in progression-free survival in CRC [10].
In terms of preclinical activity, TAK-733 differs from
selumetinib in its potency and ability to inhibit MEK1/2
activity with an IC50 for MEK1/2 of 3.6 nM compared
to that of selumetinib of 14 nM [22]. In a prior study
of selumetinib, roughly half of the cell lines exposed to
selumetinib had IC50 values > 1µM, whereas in the current
study, 42 of 54 CRC cell lines exhibited robust sensitivity
to TAK-733, as defined by an IC50 ≤ 0.02 µM, with the
majority being KRAS or BRAF mutant. Similar to studies
of other MEK inhibitors, phospho-ERK was consistently
suppressed to varying degrees and did not correlate with
sensitivity. Likewise, other downstream effectors were
variably impacted by TAK-733 and no clear conclusions
could be made with respect to resistance mechanisms,
although further studies are planned. These and other data
suggest that at least in CRC, various inherent and adaptive
resistance pathways exist to MEK inhibition that will
require rational strategies for combination therapy [14,
15, 21, 23].
In order to provide a more clinically relevant
preclinical platform for in vivo testing, we utilized patientderived xenograft (PDX) models which may be better at
recapitulating the tumor heterogeneity observed in patients
in terms of gene-expression patterns, mutational status,
and tumor architecture [24]. Additionally, we utilized
more stringent response criteria to TAK-733 by setting
a cutoff of TGII < 20, similar to RECIST measurements
utilized in the clinical trial setting [25]. In our study, TAK733 demonstrated substantial activity with 9 of 20 PDXs
exhibiting tumor regression. This is unusual for a MEK
inhibitor in CRC, and of published preclinical studies of
selumetinib and trametinib, we could only find 3 models
where regression was induced as a single agent, and this
was largely in cell line xenograft models [14, 26-28].
Furthermore, there was a trend towards tumors displaying
regression in KRAS/BRAF mutant and PIK3CA wildtype status, suggesting a potential hypothesis that can be
tested in future preclinical studies of TAK-733. Similar
to what was observed in cell lines, downregulation of
p-ERK was consistently observed regardless of response
and it was difficult to ascertain the contribution of other
potential resistance pathways at the end of study, although
robust caspase 3 induction was observed in a model
with significant regression. While prior studies of MEK
inhibition in CRC and melanoma have indicated resistance
through PI3K pathway activation, our results were not
consistent across multiple models, and may in fact, reflect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the fact that at least in the case of CRC, combinations
of PI3K and MEK inhibitors have not been particularly
active in the clinic [29, 30]. As has been reported by
us and others, resistance to MEK inhibition in CRC is
multifactorial and related to secondary mutation events,
feedback loops, or compensatory pathway activation, all
of which require improved detection methodology so that
combination therapy can be individualized [15, 31].
Not surprisingly, there was significant activity
of TAK-733 against KRAS mutant CRC, due to
constitutively active MEK and ERK phosphorylation
in this subset. Structural and functional analyses have
indicated that MEK inhibitors with superior anti-tumor
activity in KRAS-driven tumors form a strong hydrogenbond interaction with the backbone amide of S212
in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback
phosphorylation by wild-type RAF [32]. The pyridine
oxygen within the structure of TAK-733 is able to form
a hydrogen bond as described above, and this interaction
coupled with the potent inhibition of phosphorylated MEK
may explain the anti-tumor activity observed in KRAS and
BRAF mutant models, whereas activity in the non-mutant
models continues to be a mystery that warrants further
study.
From the MEK inhibitor signature, KRAS and
SPRY2 were among the highly expressed genes in the
sensitive group. Both genes are regulators of the MAPK
signaling pathway and thus the sensitive lines are
“dependent” on this pathway. Among the genes highly
expressed in the MEK signature that predict resistance
to this class of inhibitors are FZD2, a biomarker that
we previously described as modulating resistant to
AZD6244 via non-canonical Wnt pathway [15, 19].
We further demonstrated the combination of AZD6244
and Cyclosporin A (calcineurin inhibitor) is synergistic
in KRAS mutant CRC PDXs [15]. This combination
has been translated into a Phase I/II clinical trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02188264) at our institute.
Another highly expressed gene in the MEK signature in
the resistant group is anti-apoptotic gene BCL2L12, a
BCL2-family member. A recent synthetic lethality screen
of MEK inhibitor (AZD6244) in KRAS mutant cancer
identifies the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-XL as the top hit.
The combination of ABT-263 (navitoclax, a chemical
inhibitor of the BCL2 family) and a MEK inhibitor shows
synergistic effects in KRAS mutant CRC xenografts [23],
and this combination is currently being tested in a Phase
I/II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02079740).
Taken together, the MEK inhibitor sensitivity signature
is biologically relevant and provides a list of candidate
resistant genes for future combination studies with MEK
inhibitors.
In summary, TAK-733 is a potent and selective
MEK allosteric site inhibitor demonstrating significant
activity against CRC cell lines and PDXs with KRAS and
BRAF mutations. In particular, some CRC PDX models

exhibited significant tumor regression, particularly those
harboring mutations in KRAS and BRAF with no mutation
in PIK3CA. This activity in CRC provides a rationale
for further clinical study in patients with advanced CRC
with a potential patient-selective biomarker strategy
focusing on KRAS and BRAF mutant, PIK3CA wild-type
tumors. Further studies will need to focus on elucidating
mechanisms of resistance to TAK-733 and strategies to
overcome resistance pathways with novel combination
therapies.

TAK-733 for 2 hours and then exposed to 10% FBS or
serum-free media for 10 minutes. After treatment, the
cells were immediately disrupted in RIPA lysis buffer
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50
mmol/L of Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L of NaCl,
1 mmol/L of PMSF, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 5 μg/mL of
aprotonin, 5 μg/mL of leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, 1%
sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate).
Forty micrograms of total protein was loaded onto a
10% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and then
transferred to nitrocellulose using the G2 Fast Blotter
(Pierce). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in blocking
buffer [0.1% casein solution in 0.2× phosphate buffered
saline (PBS)] and were then incubated overnight at 4°C
in blocking buffer plus 0.1% Tween-20 with the primary
antibodies (Cell Signaling). Blots were then washed 3 ×
10 minutes in 1× TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and
incubated with the appropriate secondary goat anti-rabbit
and goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) DyLight™ conjugated
antibodies at 1:15,000 (Cell Signaling) for 1 hour at
room temperature. Following 3 × 10 minutes of washes,
the blots were developed using the Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Immunoblot
experiments were done in triplicate for each antibody and
representative blots are depicted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and proliferation analysis
All human colon cancer cells were grown in RPMI
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin and were maintained at 37°C in an incubator
under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells
were routinely screened for the presence of mycoplasma
(MycoAlert; Cambrex Bio Science) and were exposed
to TAK-733 when they reached approximately 70%
confluence. All cell lines were tested and authenticated
by the University of Colorado Cancer Center DNA
Sequencing and Analysis Core. DNA from CRC cell
lines was analyzed using the Profiler Plus Kit (Applied
Biosystems).
The antiproliferative effects of TAK-733 against
CRC cell lines were determined using the sulforhodamine
B (SRB) method. Briefly, cells in logarithmic growth
phase were transferred to 96-well flat-bottomed plates
with lids. Cell suspensions (100 μL) containing 3,000 to
5,000 viable cells were plated into each well and incubated
overnight before exposure with increasing concentrations
of TAK-733 for 72 hours. After treatment, medium was
removed and the cells were fixed with cold 10% TCA
for 30 minutes at 4°C. The cells were then washed with
water and stained with 0.4% SRB (Fisher Scientific) for
30 minutes at room temperature and washed again with
1% acetic acid followed by stain solubilization with 10
mmol/L of Tris at room temperature. The plate was then
read on a 96-well plate reader (Biotek Synergy 2) set at
an absorbance wavelength of 565 nm. Cell proliferation
curves were derived from the raw absorbance data and
expressed as the percentage of vehicle-treated controls.

Patient-derived tumor explant models
PDX establishment and treatment protocols were
conducted under previously described procedures [33,
34]. Briefly, surgical specimens from patients undergoing
either removal of a primary CRC or metastatic tumor at
the University of Colorado Hospital were reimplanted
s.c. into five mice for each patient. Tumor samples were
then passaged into subsequent generations of mice for
drug studies. Briefly, tumors were allowed to grow to a
size of 1,000 to 1,500 mm3 (F1) at which point they were
harvested, divided, and transplanted to an additional five
mice (F2) to maintain the tumor bank. After a subsequent
growth passage, tumors were excised, transplanted onto
both flanks of nude mice, and expanded into cohorts of
≥25 mice for treatment. Tumors from this cohort were
allowed to grow until reaching approximately 150 to
300 mm3, at which time they were equally distributed
by size into the two treatment groups: control and TAK733 treated. Because of the variability in take rates of
the human patient explant material, enough mice were
designated into each group based on the number of
overall tumors (n = at least 12 tumors per group). Mice
were treated for at least 28 days with either vehicle
control (0.5% methylcellulose) or TAK-733 (1 mg/kg)
once daily by oral gavage. Tumor growth inhibition index
was calculated from average volume of the treated (Vt)
and vehicle control (Vvc) groups, with the equation: TGII
= 100 × (Vt final -Vt initial)/(Vvc final -Vvc intial).

Immunoblotting analysis
Cells were initially plated into 6-well plates and
cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS for 24 hours. All cells
were then cultured in serum-free RPMI medium for
16 hours to lower the basal levels of ERK and AKT
phosphorylation. The cells were treated with vehicle or

Raw microarray gene expression data for the KRAS
mutant CRC cell lines was obtained from the Cancer
Cell Lines Encyclopedia (GSE36133). These samples
were profiled by the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2 arrays.
Gene expression profiles were normalized by RMA and
extracted using Affymetrix Power Tools (APT). Significant
Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (PMID: 11309499) was
performed using R, with 500 permutations. Probe sets
that passed FDR < 0.25 were selected as significantly
differentially expressed in MEK sensitive and resistant
KRAS mutant CRC cell lines. Raw microarray gene
expression data for the CRC PDX models were profiled
by the Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 arrays. Gene expression
profiles were normalized by RMA and extracted using
APT. Probe sets were matched between platforms using
the BEST_MATCH probe sets provided by Affymetrix.
Probe sets that matched between two platforms were
Z-normalized independently and merged into single
gene expression profiles for cluster analysis. We used
Spearman’s rank correlation with Average linkage analysis
in Cluster 3.0 (PMID: 14871861) and visualized in Java
TreeView for the cluster analysis.
