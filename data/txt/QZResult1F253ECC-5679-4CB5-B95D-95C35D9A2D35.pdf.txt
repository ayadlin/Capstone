Abstract
Curcumin is known to induce apoptosis of cancer cells by different mechanisms, but its effects on cancer stem
cells (CSC) have been less investigated. Here, we report that curcumin promotes the survival of DCLK1-positive
colon CSCs, potentially confounding application of its anticancer properties. At optimal concentrations,
curcumin greatly reduced expression levels of stem cell markers (DCLK1/CD44/ALDHA1/Lgr5/Nanog) in
three-dimensional spheroid cultures and tumor xenografts derived from colon cancer cells. However, curcumin
unexpectedly induced proliferation and autophagic survival of a subset of DCLK1-positive CSCs. Spheroid
cultures were disintegrated by curcumin in vitro but regrew within 30 to 40 days of treatment, suggesting a survival
beneﬁt from autophagy, permitting long-term persistence of colorectal cancer. Notably, RNA interference–
mediated silencing of DCLK1 triggered apoptotic cell death of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and abolished
colorectal cancer survival in response to curcumin; combination of DCLK1-siRNA and curcumin dramatically
reversed CSC phenotype, contributing to attenuation of the growth of spheroid cultures and tumor xenografts.
Taken together, our ﬁndings conﬁrm a role of DCLK1 in colon CSCs and highlight DCLK1 as a target to enhance
antitumor properties of curcumin. Cancer Res; 74(9); 2487–98. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer incidence remains very high in the
United States and Western world (1), and even though
several antibodies/molecules have been developed for treating colorectal cancers, surgical removal and chemo/radiotherapy remains standard of care. Colon cancer stem cells
(CSC) are believed to be resistant to chemo/radiotherapy,
and a major cause of relapse (2). Several colorectal cancer
stem cell markers, with extracellular domains, have been
identiﬁed, including CD44 (3), Lgr5 (4, 5), and DCLK1 (6, 7).
We recently reported that immortalized embryonic epithelial cells, induced to overexpress progastrin (HEKmGAS),
developed tumorigenic/metastatic potential (8). Transformed HEKmGAS CSCs coexpressed stem cell markers
DCLK1/CD44, while nontumorigenic (HEKC) cells did not
(8). Normal stem cells (NSC) from colonic crypts, positive for
DCLK1/Lgr5, also do not coexpress CD44 (9). Here, we

HT-29) coexpress stem cell markers DCLK1/CD44, similar
to tumorigenic HEKmGAS cells (8).
Curcumin (active ingredient in turmeric powder), isolated
from Curcuma longa (10), is an important ingredient of Asian
foods. Curcumin has potent anti-inﬂammatory, antibacterial,
and anticancer effects (10), but lacks solubility in aqueous
solutions; bioavailable formulations have been developed (11)
and are being examined in phase I/II clinical trials (Dr. L.
Helson, personal communication; ref. 12). Curcumin is nontoxic
at high doses (12 g/d) and targets multiple oncogenic pathways
(10, 12–14). However, proapoptotic effects of curcumin are
attenuated by autocrine growth factors (14). Thus, subpopulations of cancer cells may escape inhibitory effects of curcumin;
this concept was extended to CSCs in the current studies.
Curcumin induces caspase-3–dependent and -independent
apoptosis due to autophagy (13, 15). Autophagy represents a
double-edged sword that causes either cell death or survival of
cells (16). Majority of the studies suggest that curcumin-induced
autophagy is a prodeath signal (13, 17, 18). However, curcumininduced autophagy also allows tumor-initiating cells to survive
and either differentiate (19), or become senescent/quiescent (20,
21). Possible autophagic effects of curcumin on CSCs remain
unknown. Inhibitory effects of curcumin have been reported on
CSCs (22–25). However, response of CSCs, positive for DCLK1/
CD44/Lgr5, to curcumin remains unknown. Here, we examined
inhibitory effects of curcumin against colon cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo, in relation to effects on apoptosis/autophagy/
proliferation of DCLK1/CD44/Lgr5þ stem cells. Spheroidal
regrowth assay was used to examine resistance of CSCs to
curcumin. Our results suggest the novel possibility that
DCLK1þ cells survive curcumin-induced autophagy.

Because a subpopulation of DCLK1þ cells survived inhibitory
effects of curcumin, we examined inhibitory efﬁcacy of DCLK1siRNAcurcumin, against growth of HCT-116 cells in vitro and
in vivo. Our studies demonstrate that DCLK1-siRNA induces
apoptosis of colon cancer cells/tumors in the absence of autophagy; combination of curcuminþDCLK1-siRNA induced massive
apoptotic/autophagic cell death, resulting in almost complete
loss of stem cell populations expressing DCLK1/CD44/Lgr5.

Materials and Methods
Materials and methods used in the current study are similar
to that described previously (8). Reagents used are detailed in
Supplementary Methods (A). HCT-116, DLD-1, and HT-29
colon cancer cells from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium as previously described (26). These cells were purchased in
1990s from ATCC and were authenticated by BioSynthesis
DNA Identity Center in 2012.
Treatment of cells
Subconﬂuent cells in monolayer cultures were treated with
either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or nontargeting siRNA (controls) or optimally effective concentrations of curcumin
(25 mmol/L)DCLK1-siRNA (100 nmol/L), based on preliminary
studies with increasing concentrations of these agents. After 24
to 48 hours of treatment, cells were processed for measuring
viability/proliferation/apoptosis/autophagy by published methods (8, 17, 18), as detailed in Supplementary Methods (B).
Viability/proliferation. Brieﬂy, viability/proliferation of
cells was measured by Trypan blue exclusion test and MTT
assay, respectively, as described previously (8).
Apoptosis/autophagy/proliferation. To assess the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis/autophagy/proliferation,
control and treated cells/spheroids, dissociated enzymatically
and cytospun onto slides, were ﬁxed and processed for staining
with antibodies against apoptotic marker (activated caspase-3),
autophagic marker (LC3A/B-I/II), and proliferation marker
[proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)]. Live cells were also
stained with Acridine Orange to visualize autophagic vesicles.
Colon cancer cells grown as primary/secondary
spheroids
Colon cancer cells were grown as primary/secondary spheroids, as previously described by us (8). Primary spheroids were
treated on day 6 after seeding the wells (at which time wellformed primary-spheroids were present), with optimally effective concentrations of curcuminDCLK1-siRNA, as described
in legend of Fig. 2A. For generating secondary spheroids, wells
containing primary spheroids were enzymatically dissociated,
and approximately 5,000 cells replated in low-attachment
plates as described in Supplementary Methods (C).
Relapse experiment. For the relapse experiment (Fig. 2),
control/treated primary spheroids were dissociated and
replated as secondary spheroids and imaged daily with white
light microscopy. In some experiments, spheroids were processed for parafﬁn embedding, followed by hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining/immunohistochemistry/immunoﬂuorescence staining, as previously described (8). Control/treated

2488

spheroids were also processed for either Western blot analysis
or cell viability, as described above.
FACsorted colon cancer cells and analysis for stem cell
markers
Colon cancer cells were FACsorted and analyzed for stem cell
markers, as described previously (8) and detailed in Supplementary Methods (D). Brieﬂy, subconﬂuent cells were harvested and processed for labeling with ﬂuorophore-tagged
antibodies against DCLK1/Lgr5, FACsorted into distinct populations of positive/negative cells, cytospun and ﬁxed on slides,
and processed for immunoﬂuorescence staining with antiCD44 antibody and 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Images acquired with an epiﬂuorescent microscope were analyzed using METAMORPH, v6.0 software (Molecular Devices).
Cells grown as subcutaneous xenografts in athymic
(SCID/nude) mice
Cells were grown as subcutaneous xenografts in athymic
(SCID/nude) mice as described previously (8) and detailed in
Supplementary Methods (E). Brieﬂy, 5  106 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in both ﬂanks of female athymic mice.
One week after injection, xenografts were visible on both sides.
Mice, bearing tumors, were randomly divided into groups of
3 each. Mice were injected every 2 days with either 0.01%
DMSO (Control), curcumin (3 mg/100 mL in 0.01%DMSO ¼ 100
mmol/L), nontargeting siRNA (control; 100 (nmol/L)/100 mL
PBS), DCLK1-siRNA (0.5 pmol/100 mL in PBS ¼ 100 nmol/L), or
curcumin (100 mmol/L) and DCLK1-siRNA (100 nmol/L).
Tumor volume was measured every other day. Mice were
sacriﬁced 3 weeks after initiating treatment, and tumors were
removed and weighed and processed for Western blot/
immunoﬂuorescence analysis.
Western blot analysis of cells growing either as 2D
cultures, 3D spheroids, or xenografts
Western blot analysis of cells growing either as two-dimensional (2D) cultures, three-dimensional (3D) spheroids, or xenografts was conducted as detailed in Supplementary Methods (F).
Brieﬂy, cells/tumors were processed for Western blot analysis as
previously described (8). Blots were cut into horizontal strips
containing target or loading control proteins and processed for
detection of antigen–antibody complexes by chemiluminescence. Membrane strips containing target/loading control proteins were simultaneously exposed to autoradiographic ﬁlms. In
cases in which limited samples were analyzed for multiple
proteins, loading control b-actin was measured in a corresponding sample containing equivalent protein. In a few cases, b-actin
was stripped to measure target protein with equivalent protein
with similar molecular mass within the same membrane. Relative band density on scanned autoradiograms was analyzed
using ImageJ program (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download) and expressed as a ratio of b-actin in corresponding samples.

Effects of DCLK1-siRNACurcumin on Cancer Stem Cells

recently reported that transformed/tumorigenic embryonic
epithelial cells coexpressed stem cell markers DCLK1/CD44,
unlike isogenic nontumorigenic cells (8). Human colon cancer
cell lines were similarly positive for transformed phenotype
(representative data from HCT-116 cells are presented in
Supplementary Fig. S1i). Majority of FACSorted DCLK1þ cells
(>80%) coexpressed CD44, whereas FACSorted Lgr5þ cells did
not (Supplementary Fig. S1ii and S1iii). Surprisingly, a large
number of CD44þ cells cosorted with Lgr5þ cells (Supplementary Fig. S1i and S1iii), suggesting that a subpopulation of Lgr5þ
cells may be tightly adherent to CD44þ cells. Lineage-tracing
studies in the future may allow us to determine whether the
adherent CD44þ cells perhaps represent daughter progenitor
cells, derived from Lgr5þ cells. CD44þ cells, which cosorted
with Lgr5þ cells, did not coexpress DCLK1 (data not shown),
unlike coexpression of CD44 by a majority of DCLK1þ cells
(described above). CSCs, positive for either DCLK1 or Lgr5,
were mostly present along outer edges of spheroids, derived
from colon cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A); CD44þ cells,
on the other hand, were distributed throughout the spheroids,
providing further evidence that cells positive for only CD44

and was conducted as previously described (8). Transfected cells
in 2D were propagated in normal growth medium containing
10% fetal calf serum, and growth was examined after 48 hours in
an MTT assay. Transfected spheroids were maintained in spheroid medium as described in Supplementary Methods (C).
Statistical analysis of data
Data are presented as mean  SEM of values obtained from
four to six samples from two to three experiments/mice. To
test for signiﬁcant differences between means, nonparametric
Mann–Whitney test was used using StatView 4.1 (Abacus
Concepts, Inc.); P values were considered statistically signiﬁcant if less than 0.05.

Results
DCLK1þ colon CSCs coexpress CD44
Monolayer cultures of colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116/
DLD-1/HT-29) were analyzed by either immunoﬂuorescence
or FACSorting for expression levels of CSC markers, DCLK1/
CD44/Lgr5, as previously described (8). On an average, 2% to
3% of cells expressed stem cell markers (data not shown). We

developed dense secondary spheroids. By days 28 to 30, small
spheroidal structures appeared in wells containing curcumintreated samples (Fig. 2Ai). By day 45, curcumin-treated spheroidal cells had regrown as secondary spheroids, suggesting
that a subset of stem cells survived curcumin. Secondary cells/
spheroids were isolated as single cells at indicated days and
analyzed for cell viability (Fig. 2Aii). Surprisingly, approximately 25% of curcumin-treated cells were viable on day 4 after
replating (Fig. 2Aii), increasing dramatically by days 30 to 45,
matching regrowth of treated-cells as secondary spheroids
(Fig. 2Ai and ii). Relative levels of Lgr5 remained stable in
secondary spheroids from control wells, while relative levels of
DCLK1 increased 2- to 3-fold by days 30 to 45 (Fig. 2Bi and ii).
Curcumin treatment of primary spheroids resulted in almost
complete attenuation of Lgr5, but low levels of DCLK1
remained (Fig. 2Bii). These results suggest that a subset of
DCLK1þ cells is resistant to curcumin. At day 30, after replating, relative levels of Lgr5/DCLK1 were increased in curcumintreated spheroids; by day 45, levels had increased 2- to 4-fold
(Fig. 2Bii). Because curcumin attenuated Lgr5 expression but

were less effective (data not shown). Control-siRNA had no

mice, from the ﬁve treatment groups, are shown at day 28
in Fig. 3B. Tumor size (volume) continued to enlarge in mice in
the order of control (DMSO) ¼ control-siRNA > curcumin >
DCLK1-siRNA (Fig. 3Ci). However, in curcuminþDCLK1siRNA group, the preformed tumors actually began to shrink
in size (Fig. 3Ci). After 3 weeks of treatment, mice were
euthanized and tumor weights noted. Tumor weights in control versus treated mice followed a similar pattern described
above for tumor size (Fig. 3Cii). Surprisingly, DCLK1-siRNA
was more effective than curcumin against growth of HCT-116
cells/tumors (Fig. 3Ai and ii, B, and C), suggesting a functional
role of DCLK1 in proliferative/tumorigenic potential of CSCs.
The latter possibility was conﬁrmed in the relapse experiment
with spheroids. Primary spheroids treated with curcuminþDCLK1-siRNA did not re-form secondary spheroids even
after 60 days of replating (data not shown), and cell viability
remained <5% after replating (Fig. 2Aii).
Inhibitory efﬁcacy of curcumin on relative expression of
stem cell markers/transcription factors in HCT-116 cells
Autocrine progastrin exerts growth-promoting effects on
colon cancer cells by activating NF-kBp65/b-catenin and upregulating relative expression of DCLK1/Lgr5/CD44 (9, 26–29).
Control and curcumin-treated monolayer cultures (M), spheroids (S), and tumors (T) were harvested and analyzed by
Western blot analysis for the above indicated proteins. Representative Western blot data are presented in Supplementary
Fig. S3Ai and S3Aii; data from several blots are presented as a
percentage change in ratio of relative levels of target proteins/
b-actin in control versus curcumin-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Results conﬁrmed that curcumin attenuates
activation of b-catenin/NF-kBp65 and reduces relative expression of stem cell markers. Surprisingly, even though curcumin
reduced expression of indicated proteins by >40% to 90%
(Supplementary Fig. S3), inhibitory efﬁcacy on growth of
2Dcells/spheroids/tumors was <50% (Fig. 3A–C). Because curcumin induces autophagy (13, 15–20), which can lead to either
cell survival or cell death (16), we next examined autophagy/
apoptosis in response to curcuminDCLK1-siRNA.
Curcumin induces autophagy and apoptosis of colon
cancer cells while DCLK1-siRNA only induces apoptosis
Curcumin-treated HCT-116 cells were analyzed for relative
levels of autophagic markers (LC3A/BI-II and Beclin-1) and
activated caspase-3. Representative Western blot data are
shown in Fig. 4Ai and ii. Data from several blots are presented
as percentage change in the ratio of relative levels of target
proteins/b-actin in control versus curcumin-treated cells (Fig.
4Aiii and iv). Curcumin increased relative levels of LC3-I
between 12 and 24 hours, which was processed to generate
LC3-II (Fig. 4Ai and ii), conﬁrming previous reports (20).
Beclin-1 (autophagy-latent gene, ATG6), required to initiate
autophagosome formation (30), also increased in a timedependent manner in response to curcumin (Fig. 4Aii and iv).
Acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) stain orange/red with acridine orange and specify autophagy (31). Formation of AVOs

dose- and time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S4Ai–
S4Aiv). Increased expression/formation of LC3-I/II in response
to curcumin was conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescent staining of
HCT-116 cells in culture (Fig. 4B). A signiﬁcant percentage of
LC3þ cells in curcumin-treated samples coexpressed activated
caspase-3 (Fig. 4B, merged images), suggesting that curcumininduced autophagy results in apoptotic death of many HCT116 cells. DCLK1-siRNA signiﬁcantly increased staining for
activated caspase-3, but not LC3 (Fig. 4B). Combination of
curcuminþDCLK1-siRNA signiﬁcantly increased staining for
LC3/activated caspase-3, suggesting that combined regimen
may synergistically induce autophagy/apoptosis, wherein
majority of autophagic cells go through apoptosis (Fig. 4B).
PCNAþ cells are mainly present at outer edges of control
HCT-116 spheroids (Fig. 4C), similar to staining pattern of
DCLK1/Lgr5 (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Curcumintreated HCT-116 spheroids become positive for PCNA and
LC3-I/II in an overlapping area of spheroids (Fig. 4C), suggesting that curcumin-induced autophagy is associated with both
apoptosis (Fig. 4B) and proliferation (Fig. 4C).
To further examine cell death/cell survival role of autophagy,
HCT-116 cells were treated with an inhibitor of autophagy (3methylalanine, 3-MA; Supplementary Fig. S4B). Inhibitory
effects of curcumin were partially reversed by 3-MA, but not
to control levels (Supplementary Fig. S4B), suggesting that
curcumin-induced autophagy results in both survival/apoptosis. 3-MA had insigniﬁcant effects on cells treated with DCLK1siRNA or DCLK1-siRNAþcurcumin (Supplementary Fig. S4B),
conﬁrming that autophagy in DCLK1-siRNAþcurcumin–treated cells is mainly linked to apoptosis.
HCT-116 xenografts, harvested from control/treated mice,
were processed for H&E/immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 5). The
H&E sections from curcumin-treated tumors demonstrated
unique hollow circular areas, surrounded by concentric
layers of cells (Fig. 5Ai), not seen in other groups. As
observed in 2D/3D cells in vitro (Fig. 4B and C), control/
DCLK1-siRNA–treated tumor sections were largely negative
for LC3 (Fig. 5Aii and iii). Curcumin-treated tumor sections
demonstrated strong LC3 staining in concentric layers of
cells surrounding the hollow areas, which seemed free
of nucleated cells; combined treatment with curcuminþDCLK1-siRNA signiﬁcantly augmented LC3 staining,
but the hollow areas, surrounded by concentric layers of
cells, were not evident any longer (Fig. 5Aii). PCNAþ cells
were present along the edges of control tumors, but relatively absent in tumors treated with DCLK1-siRNA or curcuminþDCLK1-siRNA (Fig. 5Aii). Curcumin-treated tumor
sections, on the other hand, demonstrated PCNA staining in
concentric layers of cells surrounding the hollow areas (Fig.
5Aii), similar to PCNA staining pattern seen in curcumintreated spheroids (Fig. 4C). Enhanced images from Fig. 5Aii
are presented in Supplementary Fig. S5A to present the
staining of LC3 and PCNA more clearly. A signiﬁcant number of LC3-expressing cells coexpressed PCNA (Supplementary Fig. S5A, yellow color in merged images), while cells
positive for LC3 and PCNA in control tumor sections were
distinct and separate (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Percentage

tumors were minimally (1%) LC3þ, while LC3 staining of
tumor sections treated with curcumin/curcuminþDCLK1siRNA increased several fold. Control tumor sections were
positive for PCNA staining in 4% to 5% of the area, while <1%

(Fig. 5Aiii). An unexpected ﬁnding was that the percentage

PCNA staining to <1% (Fig. 5Aiii). Activation of caspase-3

Treatment of tumors with curcuminDCLK1-siRNA

Tumor sections presented in Fig. 5Aii and Bi were also
processed for DCLK1/Lgr5/CD44 staining. Representative data
from one tumor/group of a total of four to six tumors/group are
presented in Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S5B. Intensity of
staining for all three stem cell markers was strongest at the
edges of tumors. Control tumors demonstrated signiﬁcant
coexpression of DCLK1/CD44 and Lgr5/CD44 (Fig. 6A and
Supplementary Fig. S5B), conﬁrming transformed phenotype
of CSCs. Treatment with curcuminDCLK1-siRNA caused
complete attenuation of transformed phenotype, with negligible coexpression of CD44 with DCLK1/Lgr5 (Fig. 6A and
Supplementary Fig. S5Bi and S5Bii). Surprisingly, curcumintreated tumor sections demonstrated DCLK1 staining in concentric layers of cells surrounding the hollow areas (Fig. 6A and
Supplementary Fig. S5Bi); these layers of cells were also
positive for LC3 and PCNA staining, as described above for
images presented in Fig. 5Aii. The latter ﬁndings suggest the

novel possibility that autophagic cells present among the
concentric layers of cells, surrounding the hollow areas may
represent a subpopulation of DCLK1þ cells, which retain the
potential to proliferate (as suggested by PCNA-labeling of these
cells; Fig. 5Aii and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Curcumin-treated
tumor cells also continued to express CD44, unlike DCLK1siRNA–treated tumors (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Curcumin signiﬁcantly reduced expression of Lgr5, while
DCLK1-siRNA was much less effective (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S5B). CurcuminþDCLK1-siRNA was most effective in attenuating DCLK1/Lgr5 staining along with signiﬁcant

DCLK1-siRNAþcurcumin likely leads to cell death rather
than survival, unlike the response to curcumin alone.

Discussion
A novel ﬁnding of the current study is that a subset of
DCLK1þ colon CSCs is resistant to inhibitory effects of curcumin, and that DCLK1-siRNA is more effective than curcumin in
reducing tumor mass in vivo. Conventional anticancer therapies (radio/chemotherapy) primarily kill rapidly proliferating
cancer cells that form bulk of the tumors, but are believed to
spare relatively quiescent CSCs. Dietary agents, such as curcumin, are believed to suppress self-renewal of CSCs, thus,
sensitizing drug-resistant tumors (2, 23). A curcumin analog,

www.aacrjournals.org

LC3-II

G0-Y030, inhibited tumorosphere formation from ALDHA1þ/
CD133þ colon CSCs (22). We used DCLK1/Lgr5/CD44 as
markers of colon CSCs, as they mark both normal and cancer
intestinal/pancreatic stem cells (4–6, 32, 33). The spheroid
relapse assay provided the ﬁrst evidence that a subset of
DCLK1þ cells may be resistant to curcumin, becoming quiescent/dormant for a period of time before re-forming spheroids
(Fig. 2A and B), which is a hallmark of stem cells. Resistance of a
subset of esophageal squamous carcinoma cells to curcumin
has been reported; but the authors concluded that curcumin
eliminates CSCs as ALDHA1þ/CD44þ CSCs were eliminated by
curcumin (24). Another dietary agent was reported to significantly target DCLK1þ CSCs, via the Notch signaling pathway
(34). Our ﬁndings, however, suggest that DCLK1þ CSCs are not
eliminated by curcumin.
Multiple signaling pathways are inhibited by curcumin
in epithelial cancers, resulting in apoptotic death (10).

Besides apoptosis, curcumin induces caspase-3–independent
apoptosis (autophagy) in cancer cells (15). Autophagy culminates in either cell death or survival/quiescence/differentiation of tumor cells (15, 21, 18). Curcumin-induced autophagy in
cancer cells is mainly reported to result in cell death (12, 18).
Our results, however, suggest that while curcumin induces
apoptotic/autophagic cell death of many cancer cells/CSCs, it
seems to induce autophagic survival/quiescence of a subset of
DCLK1þ CSCs (Figs. 2A and B, 5Aii, and 6A), representing a
novel aspect of our ﬁndings.
Autophagy has been described as a prosurvival mechanism that acts as a cellular switch between apoptosis and
quiescence/senescence (21). Speciﬁc pathways, activated in
autophagic cells in response to curcumin, protect cells from
cell death and allow cells to differentiate or become quiescent (19, 20). Curcumin induces differentiation of autophagic glioma-initiating/embryonic stem cells (19, 35). Similar
to our ﬁndings, Mosieniak and colleagues (20) observed that
a subpopulation of curcumin-treated autophagic colon cancer cells survived, becoming senescent/quiescent; the
authors, however, did not examine possible regrowth of
cells beyond 72 hours. Our results suggest that curcumininduced quiescent colon cancer cells may represent DCLK1þ
CSCs, which become dormant for a period of time, followed
by reformation of spheroids.
Apoptotic and autophagic cell death are not mutually
exclusive but can induce cell death simultaneously and cooperatively (36), which may explain coexpression of apoptotic/
autophagic markers within same cells in response to curcumin
(Fig. 4B). Even though autophagy and apoptosis can occur in
same cells, autophagy in response to curcumin is believed to
be due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, independent of
apoptosis (37). Autophagy either allows ER-stressed cells to
survive or drives them toward apoptosis (37); it remains to be
determined whether ER stress plays a role in survival of a
subset of DCLK1þ colon cancer cells, in response to curcumin.
Besides ER stress, curcumin also induces reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which can result in autophagy (17). It is thus
possible that a subset of DCLK1þ cells are resistant to curcumin-induced ROS and/or ER stress, and spared from autophagic cell death. A complex cross-talk between several signaling pathways is believed to dictate the outcome of autophagy in
cancer cells, which can either survive or proceed to cell death,
as recently reviewed (38). In future studies, we will examine the
role of some of these pathways in allowing a subpopulation of
DCLK1þ cells to go through autophagy, associated with survival, rather than apoptosis.
Results of our in vivo studies also suggest that long-term
treatment of tumors with curcumin perhaps allows a subset
of DCLK1þ CSCs to proliferate and maintain tumor mass,
which may explain the disconnect between potent inhibitory
effects of curcumin against multiple growth-promoting
pathways (current studies and refs. 10, 13, 14), but less than
optimal inhibitory effects against tumor growth (Fig. 3B and
C). Previously also, curcumin was reported to increase a
subset of colon cancer cells in S-phase (20); based on our
results, we believe that the PCNAþ cells likely represent
DCLK1þ CSCs, which survive curcumin. Results of our

2496

Cancer Res; 74(9) May 1, 2014

preliminary studies further suggest that DCLK1þ CSCs also
survive other insults, such as radio/chemotherapy (unpublished data from our laboratory), strongly suggesting that
DCLK1 expression in CSCs is perhaps linked to chemoresistance of CSCs, allowing cells to survive autophagy by as
yet unknown mechanisms.
Because DCLK1þ cells seemed to be resistant to curcumin
and other chemotherapeutic insults as well, we examined
inhibitory effects of DCLK1-siRNA. Downregulation of DCLK1
expression signiﬁcantly reduces growth of colon cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo (7, 39), as conﬁrmed by us (Fig. 3). A surprising
and unexpected ﬁnding was that DCLK1-siRNA was more
effective than curcumin in reducing size/weight of colon
cancer tumors growing as subcutaneous xenografts (Fig.
3C). Combination of DCLK1-siRNAþcurcumin was even more
effective than either agent alone, and caused preformed
tumors to lose tumor mass (Fig. 3C). Synergistic inhibitory
effects of curcumin against cancer cells/CSCs from many
different organs have been previously reported with chemotherapeutic agents (reviewed in ref. 23). Here, we demonstrate
for the ﬁrst time, synergistic inhibitory effects of curcumin with
siRNA molecules against a stem cell marker, DCLK1. Although
curcumin treatment resulted in both apoptotic cell death and
autophagic survival, DCLK1-siRNA caused only apoptotic cell
death of colon cancer cells (Figs. 4B and 5B). RNA interference
against other CSC markers, such as CD44, also inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells (3), suggesting that DCLK1 and CD44 may represent functional CSC
markers, which play an important role in maintaining proliferative potential of cancer cells. Many reports strongly suggest
that DCLK1 expression is critically required for maintaining
tumorous growths in many different organs, including intestines and pancreas (6, 7, 33, 39, 40), as further conﬁrmed in the
current studies.
Combined regimen of curcuminþDCLK1-siRNA augmented both apoptotic/autophagic cell death pathways, with no
sign of proliferation/survival of CSC populations. It is therefore speculated that addition of DCLK1-siRNA overcomes
resistance of a subset of DCLK1þ cells to curcumin, resulting
in possible elimination of CSCs, as suggested by the results
of the relapse assay (Fig. 2Aii); however, it remains possible
that a subset of quiescent CSCs, positive for other stem cell
markers, such as Lgr5, remain dormant/undetectable. Our
results suggest that while curcumin targets Lgr5þ CSCs,
DCLK1-siRNA does not eliminate LGR5þ CSCs (Fig. 6). On
the basis of our results, it is proposed that combination of
curcuminþDCLK1-siRNA may therefore be effective toward
eliminating CSCs positive for Lgr5/DCLK1/CD44. In a previous study, we had reported that addition of p38MAPK may
overcome resistance of insulin—like growth factor-II (IGFII)–expressing colon cancer cells to curcumin (14). On the
basis of recent ﬁndings, as discussed above, it may be
possible to overcome resistance of a subset of DCLK1þ
CSCs against curcumin by adding inhibitors of ROS, and/or
autophagy, to avoid possible deleterious effects of downregulating DCLK1 in normal intestinal stem cells and neuroprogenitor cells (6, 41, 42). Thus, in the future, it may be
possible to avoid toxic effects of radio/chemotherapy by
