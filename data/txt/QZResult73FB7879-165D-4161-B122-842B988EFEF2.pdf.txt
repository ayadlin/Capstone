Abstract

Author Manuscript

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in males
and the second highest cause of cancer-related mortality. We identified an RNA helicase gene,
DDX3 (DDX3X), which is overexpressed in prostate cancers, and whose expression is directly
correlated with high Gleason scores. Knockdown of DDX3 in the aggressive prostate cancer cell
lines DU145 and 22Rv1 resulted in significantly reduced clonogenicity. To target DDX3, we
rationally designed a small molecule, RK-33, which docks into the ATP-binding domain of
DDX3. Functional studies indicated that RK-33 preferentially bound to DDX3 and perturbed its
activity. RK-33 treatment of prostate cancer cell lines DU145, 22Rv1, and LNCaP (which have

high DDX3 levels) decreased proliferation and induced a G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Conversely,
the low DDX3–expressing cell line, PC3, exhibited few changes following RK-33 treatment.
Importantly, combination studies using RK-33 and radiation exhibited synergistic effects both in
vitro and in a xenograft model of prostate cancer demonstrating the role of RK-33 as a
radiosensitizer. Taken together, these results indicate that blocking DDX3 by RK-33 in
combination with radiation treatment is a viable option for treating locally advanced prostate
cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignant cancer in men in Western
countries. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, prostate cancer still remains the
most prevalent cancer in males, with an estimated 180,890 new cases and 26,120 deaths in
the United States in 2016 (1). It has been suggested that the development of prostate cancer
from benign prostatic epithelial cells is a stepwise progression that leads to high-grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive adenocarcinoma, distant metastatic disease, and
finally lethal castration-resistant metastatic disease (2). Screening and treatment monitoring
of prostate cancer utilizes mainly the highly sensitive and specific prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) serum biomarker (3). However, there are many drawbacks to the use of PSA as a
screening biomarker tool, including unnecessary biopsies and low specificity. Furthermore,
PSA has limitations as a prognostic and predictive biomarker (4). Although there are reports
of other biomarkers associated with prostate cancer patients, including but not limited to
markers of apoptosis such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and BCL2-associated X protein, a
marker of proliferation rate (Ki67), p53 mutation or expression, p27, E-cadherin, p16, and
PTEN expression, none of these biomarkers have been prospectively validated. Thus, new
prognostic biomarkers are required, especially to differentiate between low and high grades
of aggressive cancer to improve clinical management (4, 5).

Recently, we have discovered that an RNA helicase, DDX3, is dysregulated in many cancer
types, including prostate cancer. Our earlier investigations showed that overexpression of
DDX3 induced an epithelial–mesenchymal transition, along with increased motility and
invasive capabilities, in cigarette smoke-induced breast cancer (6). DDX3 also modulates
cell adhesion and motility (7), and has an important role in the hypoxia response (8). DDX3
is a multifunctional protein that belongs to the aspartate-glutamate-alanine-aspartate (D-EA-D) box RNA helicase family (9–11). The putative functions of DDX3 have been
associated with a variety of cellular functions, including cell-cycle progression, cellular
proliferation, and apoptosis under various conditions (12–15). On the basis of the
crystallographic structure of DDX3, we rationally designed a small-molecule inhibitor,
RK-33, which has been demonstrated to bind to DDX3 and inhibit its helicase activity in
breast and lung cancer cell lines (6, 16–18). RK-33 inhibits proliferation of multiple lung
cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and acts as a radiosensitizer in lung cancer
mice models (19).
Conventional treatments for prostate cancer include active surveillance, surgery,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy has been used effectively as the first-line

treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer. However, radioresistance can develop in
14%–91% of patients after radiotherapy (20). A radiosensitizer, combined with radiotherapy,
may provide not only the benefit of higher radiosensitivity, but may also allow radiation dose
reduction to reduce normal tissue toxicity.

Author Manuscript

Here, we report that DDX3 expression levels correlate to the aggressiveness of prostate
cancer cell lines and patient tumor samples. Knockdown of DDX3 leads to significantly
reduced clonogenic ability in aggressive androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines, such
as DU145 and 22Rv1. Our rationally designed DDX3 inhibitor showed inhibition of cell
proliferation in the high DDX3–expressing prostate cancer cell lines DU145, 22Rv1, and
LNCaP, compared with little inhibition in the low DDX3–expressing cell line, PC3.
Interestingly, combination studies using RK-33 and radiation exhibited synergistic effects
both in vitro and in a xenograft model of prostate cancer. As radiation is a mainstay of highgrade prostate cancer treatment, we feel that the use of DDX3 may be used as a biomarker to
select for RK-33 treatment, which in combination with radiation, will not only significantly
increase local control, but also reduce many of the side effects associated with current
conventional therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents

Author Manuscript

PC3, 22Rv1, and DU145 cells were obtained from Dr. Phuoc Tran (The Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD) in 2013. PC3 and 22Rv1 were authenticated by short tandem
repeat profiling in 2015. DU145 was purchased from ATCC in 2013. LNCaP cells were
obtained from Dr. Kenneth Pienta (The Johns Hopkins University) from ATCC in 2011.
DU145-Luc cancer cells were kindly provided by Dr. Evan Keller (University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, MI) in 2014. Cells were maintained in RPMI1640 (Corning) containing 10%
FBS. All cell lines were maintained under standard sterile cell culture conditions in a
humidified incubator at 37 C and air containing 5% CO2. The primary antibodies used were
mAbs against DDX3 (21). DDX3 shRNA lentiviral constructs have been described
previously (6). Wound-healing assays were performed as described previously (6). Cell
proliferation and flow cytometry assays were carried out as described previously (22, 23).
Colony formation assays

Author Manuscript

PC3, DU145, and 22Rv1 cells transduced with vector and shDDX3 were seeded in 6-well
plates at a density of 200 cells per well for PC3 and DU145, and 250 cells per well for
22Rv1. After incubation for 2–3 weeks, colonies were stained with 0.05% (w/v) crystal
violet and counted. PC3, DU145, 22Rv1, and LNCaP were plated at different densities in 6well plates 24 hours before treatment with RK-33, and radiation treatment with different
doses was administered 1 hour after adding RK-33. After incubation for 2–3 weeks, colonies
were stained with 0.05% (w/v) crystal violet and counted. All experiments were performed
in triplicates.

Mice experiments

Author Manuscript

Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines from the Johns Hopkins
Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions
with regulated temperature and humidity. Mice were randomly assigned in groups of 5 per
cage, and given food and water ad libitum under controlled light/dark cycles.
SCID (NCI, Fredrick, MD) mice were purchased (32 in total) at 4–6 weeks of age. DU145Luc cells in growth medium mixed with Matrigel (1:1; 2.5 million cells per injection) were
inoculated in both the right and left flanks of 6- to 8-week-old male SCID mice using a 28gauge needle, when mice were anesthetized using 3% isoflurane. Mice were monitored
weekly until a tumor could be felt by palpation.

Mice were randomly redistributed into four groups of 8 according to their tumor growth,
which resulted in an approximately equal distribution of tumor size at the beginning of
radiation and RK-33 drug treatment. The four groups of mice were blindly chosen for four
different experimental procedures, including control (injection of DMSO only), RK-33
treatment (injection of RK-33 only 50 mg/kg), radiation (one-time radiation of 5 Gy), or
radiation and RK-33 treatment (combination of radiation of 5 Gy and RK-33 injection).
RK-33 and DMSO were injected intraperitoneally thrice weekly for two weeks. Radiation
was performed at the beginning of drug injection using the Small Animal Radiation
Research Platform (SARRP; ref. 24) with a circular beam of 1-cm diameter, focusing on the
tumor site. Mice of each group were euthanized 0 and 24 hours after radiation and tumors
were extracted for γH2AX, cleaved caspase-3, and Ki67 staining. The remaining mice of
each group were imaged with a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum (PerkinElmer), with injection of Dluciferin 5 minutes before imaging. Mice were euthanized after 6 weeks of imaging and
tumors were extracted for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, cleaved caspase-3, and
Ki67 staining. Morphology of the tumors after RK-33 and radiation treatment was assessed
by a veterinary pathologist on H&E-stained sections.
Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Prostate cancer cells PC3, DU145, and LNCaP (20,000 cells/ plate) were allowed to attach
overnight in chamber slides. Cells were incubated with RK-33 (PC3 12 μmol/L, DU145 3
μmol/L, LNCaP 6 μmol/L) for 1 hour before 2 Gy radiation treatment. After 0, 1, 6, and 24
hours of radiation, cells were fixed for 15 minutes in 4% formalin, washed with PBS,
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes, and blocked with 10% goat serum for
30 minutes. Cells were incubated with anti-γH2AX mAb (dilution 1:1,600, EMD Millipore)
antibodies in 0.5% BSA/PBS for 1 hour. Next, cells were washed with PBS and incubated
with the secondary antibodies, CY3 (dilution 1:200, goat anti-mouse, Jackson
ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour. Cells were washed, nuclei-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI), and cover-slipped. Photographs were taken with a Nikon Eclipse 80i
fluorescence microscope using a CoolSnap ES camera (Roper Scientific).

(Utrecht, the Netherlands) and routinely processed into a tissue microarray, as described
previously (25). The clinicopathologic data, including tumor PSA, Gleason score, tumor
stage, lymph node involvement, perineural growth, and resection success, was collected
from patient files (Supplementary Table S1). Risk group was determined following EAU/
ESTRO guidelines. Protein expression data by IHC of von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor
protein (VHL), prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 1 (PHD1), PHD3, VEGF,
Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), Ki67, and the androgen
receptor (AR) were derived from previous studies (25). Survival statistics were obtained
from the Comprehensive Cancer Centre, the Netherlands (IKNL).

As we used archival leftover pathology material and our study did not affect the included
patients, no ethical approval was required according to Dutch legislation (26). Use of
anonymous or coded leftover material for scientific purposes is part of the standard
treatment contract with patients in the UMCU, congruent with Dutch law (27). Hence, the
requirement for consent was waived.
IHC
Four-micron sections were cut, transferred on SuperFrost slides (Menzel & Glaeser),
deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in decreasing ethanol dilutions. Endogenous
peroxidase was then blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide buffer for 15 minutes for DDX3
and 3% hydrogen peroxide buffer in methanol for 10 minutes for Ki67, γH2AX, and
cleaved caspase-3 (CC3). Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling in 10 mmol/L citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 minutes, cooling, and washing with PBS.

Slides were subsequently incubated in a humidified chamber for 1 hour with anti-DDX3
(dilution 1:1,000, polyclonal antibody r647; ref. 21), anti-Ki67 (dilution 1:1,000, Leica
Biosystems), or anti-CC3 (dilution 1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology), or overnight with
anti-γH2AX (dilution 1:500, Cell Signaling Technology). Secondary poly-HRP-anti-mouse/
rabbit/rat IgG (BrightVision, Immunologic) for 30 minutes was used for DDX3 slides and
poly-HRP anti-rabbit IgG (Leica Biosystems) for 1 hour was used for all other stainings.
Subsequently, slides were washed with PBS and developed with diaminobenzidine, and
lightly counter-stained with hematoxylin and mounted. Appropriate positive and negative
controls were used throughout.

Author Manuscript

For mice tumor slides, scoring of Ki67, γH2AX, and CC3 was performed by scoring the
percentage of positive nuclei per tumor. For patient tumor slides, the intensity of cytoplasmic
DDX3 expression was scored semiquantitatively as absent (0), low (1), moderate (2), or high
(3). Cases with score of 0 to 2 were classified as having low DDX3 expression and evaluated
against cases with strong expression, as performed previously (8, 19, 28). Nuclear
expression of DDX3 was scored as absent or present. Two observers (P.J. van Diest and
G.M. Bol) scored the slides, in consensus.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed a minimum of three times. Cytotoxicity graphic data were
presented as the mean percentages of control ± SEM. Linear regression analysis was used to
compute the concentration of test agent needed to reduce mitochondrial activity by 50%,

termed the midpoint cytotoxicity. Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 23.0 for
Windows (IBM Inc.). Only two-sided P values <0.05 were considered significant and are
indicated by an asterisk (*) in the figures. Expression levels of DDX3 and the
clinicopathologic features were compared by χ2 test, t test, Fisher exact test, or Mann–
Whitney, whenever applicable. Overall survival of prostate cancer patients was assessed by
computing Kaplan–Meier curves, and differences between the curves were tested by the logrank test.

Results
Overexpression of DDX3 correlates to prostate cancer progression

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

DDX3 overexpression has an oncogenic role in many cancer types including but not limited
to breast cancer, lung cancer, medulloblastomas, and colorectal cancer (6, 19, 29, 30). To
corroborate our findings in prostate cancer patients, we analyzed a total of 90 samples for
DDX3 expression and found that there was a significant difference (P < 0.02) in the staining
intensity of DDX3 in cancer cells compared with normal cells (Fig. 1A). In addition,
prostate cancer samples exhibited a differential cytoplasmic and nuclear staining pattern
(Fig. 1A). We also searched the Oncomine database to confirm our results. The Wallace
prostate dataset (31) showed that the DDX3 mRNA expression of prostate adenocarcinoma
was more than two times higher than that of the normal prostate gland (data not shown).
Clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with low and high DDX3 expression can be
seen in Supplementary Table S1. No significant correlations were observed between either
cytoplasmic or nuclear DDX3 expression or other variables (data not shown). Cytoplasmic
DDX3 was associated with other immunohistochemical markers (Supplementary Table S2).
A positive correlation was observed with p21 (P = 0.038) and AR expression (P = 0.006).
Cytoplasmic DDX3 correlated positively with cytoplasmic PHD2 (P = 0.042), cytoplasmic
PHD3 (P = 0.002), and cytoplasmic CA9 (P < 0.001). Nuclear DDX3 correlated positively
with nuclear PHD2 (P = 0.004) and negatively with AR (P = 0.003) and cytoplasmic VHL
(P = 0.008).
Follow-up of prostate cancer patients with a low or high cytoplasmic DDX3 expression level
indicated that there were no significant differences in patient’s survival rate (Fig. 1B and C).
Knockdown of DDX3 in prostate cancer cell lines with various DDX3 expression levels

Author Manuscript

As overexpression of DDX3 has been related to prostate cancer, we assessed the protein
levels of four prostate cancer cell lines, including three androgen-insensitive cell lines (PC3,
DU145, and 22Rv1) and one androgen-sensitive cell line (LNCaP). We discovered that the
DDX3 expression levels of DU145 and LNCaP were high, while 22Rv1 had moderate
expression and PC3 had low expression of DDX3 (Fig. 2A). To assess the function of DDX3
in prostate cancer, we generated DDX3 knockdown cell lines of DU145, PC3, and 22Rv1
(Fig. 2B). Knockdown of DDX3 significantly reduced the clonogenic ability in DU145,
partially reduced the clonogenic ability in 22Rv1, but not in PC3, which is characterized by
low expression of DDX3 (Fig. 2C). DDX3 knockdown significantly slowed the proliferation
rate in DU145 and 22Rv1, but did not affect the proliferation of PC3 (Fig. 2D). We

confirmed the specificity of shDDX3 targeting with the help of a rescue experiment

RK-33 inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines dependent on DDX3 expression
levels and causes cell-cycle arrest

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Recently, our laboratory synthesized a small-molecule RK-33 (Fig. 3A), which serves as a
DDX3 inhibitor with radiosensitizing properties. RK-33 has anticancer activity in lung
cancer, as well as many other cancer types, including breast cancer and sarcoma (16, 17, 19,
32). An MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetra-zolium) assay of RK-33 treatment showed that DU145, LNCaP, and
22Rv1 were sensitive to RK-33 at half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 3–6 μmol/L),
whereas PC3 was much less sensitive to RK-33 (IC50 >12 μmol/L; Fig. 3B). It is worth
noting that DU145, with the highest amount of DDX3 expression levels, showed the most
sensitivity to RK-33 treatment, whereas PC3, with the lowest amount of DDX3 expression
levels, showed the least sensitivity to RK-33. RK-33 also inhibits DDX3 helicase function,
which is involved in translation and cell-cycle regulation (33). To determine whether growth
inhibition of prostate cancer cell lines by RK-33 involved cell-cycle arrest, we performed
flow cytometry analysis on RK-33–treated cancer cell lines (Fig. 3C). PC3 did not show a
significant difference between RK-33–treated and untreated cells, while the cell cycle in
DU145, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 cells was perturbed by RK-33 treatment. RK-33 treatment
caused a significant accumulation in the G1 phase for DU145 and LNCaP (P < 0.05),
although treatment with RK-33 caused only a moderate accumulation of the G1 phase for
22Rv1, and the treated cells had significantly reduced G2 phase. In cell lines with a high
expression level of DDX3 (DU145 and LNCaP), arrest occurred in the G1 phase after
treatment with RK-33. RK-33 treatment also caused moderate G1 accumulation in 22Rv1.
However, RK-33 did not perturb the cell cycle of PC3, which is characterized by low DDX3
expression levels. Thus, the RK-33 perturbation of the cell cycle in prostate cancer cell lines
may be dependent on the expression level of DDX3.
RK-33 reduced cell motility in DU145 and PC3 cell lines

Author Manuscript

As RK-33 inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines and causes G1 arrest, we
next asked whether RK-33 could reduce the motility of prostate cancer cells. We chose PC3
and DU145 for the motility assay as the motility of 22Rv1 itself is low and LNCaP grows
slowly and tends to detach after certain confluence. The result of the scratch assay indicated
that treatment with RK-33, even at lower concentrations (1.5 μmol/L for DU145 and 6
μmol/L for PC3), reduced the motility for migration compared with untreated prostate
cancer cells of DU145 and PC3, in which the scratch gaps were completely filled in 36
hours (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Moreover, the higher concentration of RK-33
reduced the cancer cell motility more than the lower concentration. We confirmed these
results with the help of a Boyden chamber assay (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Combination of RK-33 and radiation reduced clonogenicity in a synergistic or additive
pattern
As radiotherapy is one of the major treatment options for prostate cancer patients and RK-33
has been identified as a radiosensitizer for lung cancer (18, 19), we explored the treatment

combination of radiation and RK-33 for the clonogenicity of prostate cancer cells, including
PC3, DU145, 22Rv1, and LNCaP. In this experiment, we chose different radiation doses
according to the sensitivity of the prostate cancer cells. The results indicated that the
treatment combination of RK-33 and radiation exhibited a synergistic effect in DU145 and
LNCaP cells that overexpress DDX3 (Fig. 4). In contrast, 22Rv1 and PC3, with lower
DDX3 expression, showed lower RK-33–induced radiosensitization. In this combination
study, we used the Bliss Independence Model (34) as we made the assumption that radiation
and RK-33 act independently to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. As described earlier,
the effect of RK-33 alone was normalized; therefore, the overlapping curves for radiation
alone and the combination of RK-33 and radiation indicated an additive effect in PC3 cells.
The survival curve of the combination, which was below that of radiation alone, indicated a
synergistic effect in 22Rv1, DU145, and LNCaP (Fig. 4).

Immunocytochemistry of γH2AX indicates a slowed DNA damage repair process in cells
treated with a combination of RK-33 and radiation

Author Manuscript

As radiation causes DNA double-strand breaks in cancer cells, the cancer cells recruit DNA
damage repair proteins to help survive after radiation. γH2AX, the phosphorylated form of
the histone H2AX, is the first step in recruiting and localizing DNA repair protein (35). To
explore the possible mechanism of the synergistic effect of the treatment combination of
RK-33 and radiation, we investigated the marker of DNA double-strand breaks, γH2AX, in
the three prostate cancer cell lines, PC3, DU145, and LNCaP. The result shown in Fig. 5
indicated that γH2AX foci increased dramatically 1 hour after radiation and gradually fell
after the double-strand breaks were repaired. Compared with radiation treatment alone, the
combination treatment did not result in more double-strand breaks at 1 hour for DU145;
however, there were more foci at 6 and 24 hours. In LNCaP cells, there were more γH2AX
foci even at 1 hour. In PC3 cells, only at 24 hours were there more foci in the treatment
combination of RK-33 and radiation. This is an indicator that the DNA damage repair
process in the presence of RK-33 has been slowed or requires more γH2AX to overcome the
inhibition of DNA damage repair by caused by RK-33.
In vivo combination treatment of RK-33 and radiation in DU145-luc SCID mice

Author Manuscript

The promising results of the treatment combination of RK-33 and radiation in vitro
encouraged us to explore the combination treatment in a mouse model. Four randomized
groups of SCID mice inoculated with DU145-Luc (engineered with luciferase) were treated
with DMSO, RK-33, and the combination of RK-33 and radiation, and tumors were imaged
for bioluminescence emission. As shown in Fig. 6A, tumors of the DMSO and RK-33
groups weighed more than those of the radiation and RK-33 radiation groups. The median
weight of tumors in the DMSO group was slightly higher than that in the RK-33 group.
There was no significant difference in median weight for the radiation and RK-33 radiation
group (median weight between 30 and 40 mg). As the sizes of tumors treated with radiation
or radiation combined with RK-33 were small, measuring tumor weight or tumor size may
not have accurately reflected tumor growth or tumor necrosis. We used luciferase-engineered
DU145 cells for bioluminescence imaging on an IVIS system, which is more sensitive and
accurate for the early detection of tumor growth and development, tumor cell death, and
necrosis (36, 37). The signal we detected, total flux, is proportional to the number of lightCancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 August 30.

emitting cells and the calibrated IVIS system allowed us to monitor tumor growth more
accurately and over a long period of time. The imaging results indicated that the tumor
growth of the radiation group was significantly higher compared with the combination
group. Tumor growth in the radiation group increased significantly over 5 weeks of
measurement, while tumor growth in the combination group did not increase at all after the
second week (Fig. 6B). To study the differential tumor growth in the two groups, tumors
from dissected mice were sliced and stained with Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 antibody. As
shown in Fig. 6C, there were less cells stained with Ki67 antibody and more cells stained
with cleaved caspase-3 antibody in the tumors of the combination group, indicating less
proliferation and more apoptosis. The representative pictures of cleaved caspase-3 and Ki67
staining are shown in Fig. 6D. H&E staining indicated that there was more cell death
(pyknotic or condensed nuclei) admixed with fibrin and interstitial edema in the tumors from
mice from the combination RK-33 and radiation group compared with the control or single
treatment groups (Fig. 6E).

To determine whether the DNA damage repair pathway was disturbed by the combination of
RK-33 and radiation, a subset of mice inoculated with DU145-Luc were randomly divided
into four groups for DMSO, RK-33, radiation, and the combination of RK-33 and radiation.
Mice were dissected at 30 minutes and 24 hours after radiation treatment. Tumor sections
were stained with γH2AX, Ki67, and cleaved caspase-3 antibody. γH2AX levels increased
even at 30 minutes after radiation and γH2AX levels remained high at 24 hours after
radiation for the combination treatment, while γH2AX levels decreased more than 60% at
24 hours for the radiation group (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results confirmed our in
vitro findings. The results of Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 indicated that radiation treatment
(both radiation and the combined treatment of radiation and RK-33) decreased Ki67 levels
and increased cleaved caspase levels at 30 minutes of radiation, and the effects of radiation
for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 were sustained for at least 24 hours. RK-33 treatment alone
did not affect the tumor proliferation at either time point (Ki67 levels equal to DMSO
group), but did induce apoptosis at 24 hours after treatment (cleaved caspase-3 level
increased at 24 hours). Thus, the treatment combination of RK-33 and radiation has an
advantage in reducing tumor proliferation, possibly through inhibiting the DNA damage
repair pathway by RK-33.

Prostate cancer, sometimes viewed as a chronic and manageable disease, still remains the
most prevalent cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males in the
United States. The current treatment armamentarium for prostate cancer includes surgery,
radiation, hormonal therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. The major
chemotherapy drugs effective for locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer are the
taxanes, which disrupt microtubule function. In addition, radiotherapy is a well-established
treatment for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer, but radiation efficacy for poorrisk disease still requires improvement. Physical radiation dose escalation has reached a
maximum secondary to dose-limiting rectal and genitourinary toxicity. Another approach to
increase the efficacy of radiotherapy are via tumor-specific radiosensitizing agents. Thus,

alternate strategies and drugs with new mechanisms of action are needed in the prostate
cancer field.
DDX3 has been discovered to play an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis in many cancer types,
including breast cancer, lung cancer, medulloblastoma, and colorectal cancer (6, 19, 29, 30,
38). Although there are some controversial data indicating that DDX3 is a tumor suppressor
(39–41), it is possible that the function of DDX3 is organ-specific. Our previous data in lung
cancer indicate that inhibition of DDX3 function by a small-molecule inhibitor, RK-33,
reduces cell proliferation in lung cancer and radiosensitizes lung cancer cells in a DDX3dependent manner (19). Radiotherapy remains one of the mainstays for prostate cancer
treatment, making DDX3 inhibition a highly promising therapeutic approach. RK-33, as a
nontoxic small molecule, which inhibits DNA repair induced by radiation, would be a
promising option for a combination radiation treatment for prostate cancer.

Our clinical data indicate that prostate cancer patients express higher DDX3 levels compared
with normal patients. Also, distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic DDX3 expression was observed
in some prostate cancer patient samples. It is possible that the presence of nuclear DDX3
corresponds with altered translational demands in cancers, but the exact role of nuclear
versus cytoplasmic DDX3 remains to be elucidated. Also, the differential localization of
DDX3 within the cancer cells may reflect the multifunctional role of DDX3 not only in
translation but also enhancing specific transcriptional products and regulating discrete
cellular processes. Through searching Oncomine database, we also found that the DDX3
mRNA expression level is higher in prostate adenocarcinoma. To determine DDX3 function
in prostate cancer cell lines, we have knocked down DDX3 in three prostate cancer cell lines
(PC3, DU145, and 22Rv1) and found that DDX3 knockdown reduces cell proliferation and
clonogenicity in DU145 and 22Rv1, but not in PC3. We checked the DDX3 levels of four
prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, 22Rv1, and LNCaP) and found that DU145 and
LNCaP overexpressed DDX3, 22Rv1 expressed moderate levels of DDX3, whereas PC3
expressed low levels of DDX3. The low expression level of DDX3 in PC3 may indicate that
the role of DDX3 is not as crucial in PC3 cell lines as in other cell lines. RK-33 treatment of
four prostate cancer cell lines indicated that the efficiency of RK-33 in inhibiting cell
proliferation could be related to the DDX3 expression levels. Cell-cycle analysis of prostate
cancer cell lines indicates that RK-33 causes cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The woundhealing assay (scratch assay) of PC3 and DU145 treated with RK-33 indicates that RK-33
reduced cell motility in DU145 and even in PC3.

RK-33, being a nontoxic drug in vivo, would be an ideal radiosensitizer in combination with
radiation treatment in prostate cancer, and will have a benefit by reducing radiation dose and
frequency, while maintaining or improving upon tumor cell kill. To assess whether the
combination of RK-33 and radiation was synergistic, an in vitro clonogenic assay and an in
vivo imaging of mice inoculated with DU145-Luc were performed. The combination of
RK-33 and radiation reduced colony-forming ability significantly in DU145 and LNCaP, but
only slightly in 22Rv1 and PC3. Combination of 3 μmol/L RK-33 and 6 Gy radiation for
DU145 and a combination of 6 μmol/L RK-33 and 4 Gy radiation for LNCaP reduced
clonogenic ability two to three times more compared with radiation treatment alone, while
the combination of 6 μmol/L RK-33 and 4 Gy radiation for 22Rv1 and the combination of

12 μmol/L RK-33 and 6 Gy radiation reduced clonogenic ability 50%–100% more compared
with radiation treatment alone. The in vivo combination treatment of RK-33 and radiation
caused less tumor cell proliferation and more cell apoptosis in the DU145-Luc–inoculated
SCID mice model. Both in vitro and in vivo immunostaining indicated that the DNA damage
repair process in DDX3-rich cell lines (DU145 and LNCaP in vitro, DU145 in vivo) were
slowed by the treatment combination of RK-33 and radiation, which may explain the
synergistic effect of the combination treatment in reducing the clonogenicity and
proliferation rate, as well as inducing apoptosis in prostate cell lines.
In conclusion, DDX3 could serve as a marker of high grade and aggressive prostate cancer
and the small-molecule DDX3 inhibitor, RK-33, could function as a radiosensitizer for
prostate cancers with a high DDX3 expression.
