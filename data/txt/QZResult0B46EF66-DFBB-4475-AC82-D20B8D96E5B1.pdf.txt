ABSTRACT
Brain tumours kill more children and adults under 40 than any other cancer.
Around half of primary brain tumours are glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs) where
treatment remains a significant challenge.GBM survival rates have improved little over
the last 40 years, thus highlighting an unmet need for the identification/development
of novel therapeutic targets and agents to improve GBM treatment. Using archived and
fresh glioma tissue, we show that in contrast to normal brain or benign schwannomas
GBMs exhibit re-expression of FANCD2, a key protein of the Fanconi Anaemia (FA)
DNA repair pathway, and possess an active FA pathway. Importantly, FANCD2
expression levels are strongly associated with tumour grade, revealing a potential
exploitable therapeutic window to allow inhibition of the FA pathway in tumour cells,
whilst sparing normal brain tissue. Using several small molecule inhibitors of the
FA pathway in combination with isogenic FA-proficient/deficient glioma cell lines
as well as primary GBM cultures, we demonstrate that inhibition of the FA pathway
sensitises gliomas to the chemotherapeutic agents Temozolomide and Carmustine.
Our findings therefore provide a strong rationale for the development of novel and
potent inhibitors of the FA pathway to improve the treatment of GBMs, which may
ultimately impact on patient outcome.

INTRODUCTION

Around half of primary brain tumours are highgrade malignant astrocytomas, also known as glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM). Treatment of GBM remains a
significant challenge with a median patient survival
of ~1yr. Current treatments are limited by anatomical
constraints e.g. proximal neural areas, high resistance
to radio-/chemotherapy and the blockading effect of the
blood-brain barrier to systemically administered agents
[1]. In addition to surgery, standard treatment for these
tumours consists of chemotherapeutic agents such as
Temozolomide (TMZ), Carmustine (BCNU) and/or
radiotherapy regimes. Previous work has suggested that
up-regulation of DNA response (DDR) pathways in GBM

Brain tumours are the biggest cancer killers of
the under 40s with over 400,000 new cases diagnosed
worldwide each year. They also represent the commonest
site for solid tumours in childhood under the age of 15
[1]. However, brain tumour research has received far less
funding than many other cancers and patient survival has
improved little over the last 40 years (Cancer Research
UK, Brain Tumour Research and The Brain Tumour
Charity). There is therefore an unmet need for the
development of novel targets and agents to improve GBM
treatment.

may contribute to some of the relative ineffectiveness of
these agents [2, 3]. However, the underlying molecular
mechanisms driving inherent or acquired resistance of
GBM to DNA damaging agents has yet to be determined.
There is therefore precedence for determination of
expression levels/activity of DDR factors in GBM that
could account for resistance to therapeutic agents, as well
as highlighting novel drug targets as a means to augment
the cytotoxicity of current therapeutic regimes.
The Fanconi Anaemia (FA) pathway is comprised
of at least 16 proteins that promote the repair of lesions
that impede DNA replication in order to preserve genome
integrity [4-6]. As such, the FA pathway is activated
during DNA replication or in response to the detection
of replication-blocking lesions [7], and is therefore often
down regulated in differentiated cells [8]. Consistent with
this, previous studies have shown that highly proliferative
tissues such as testis, tonsils and spleen exhibit high levels
of FANCD2 and FANCA expression, yet non-proliferative
tissues such as lung, liver, muscle and the brain exhibit
minimal protein expression [9, 10]. Furthermore, a recent
large-scale gene expression study revealed that at least
11 of the FA genes exhibit increased expression at the
mRNA level in GBM compared to normal brain tissue
[11]. This raises the possibility that as brain tumours such
as oligodenrogliomas and astrocytomas become more
proliferative, they re-activate the FA pathway.
The FA pathway is activated in response to a variety
of DNA damaging agents that impede DNA replication,
where it acts to facilitate lesion repair and/or bypass, and
co-ordinates recruitment and activity of other DNA repair
pathways needed to repair such lesions [12]. As such,
cells defective in the FA pathway are rendered sensitive
to a variety of DNA crosslinking agents, making the
FA pathway an attractive target for inhibition in cancer
cells. In an attempt to identify novel inhibitors of the FA
pathway (FAPi), several groups have carried out largescale small-molecule library screens [13-16]. These studies
have revealed four FAPi that are currently commercially
available; curcumin and its monoketone analogues EF24 & 4H-TTD, and the menadione analogue DDN [1316]. However, the mode of action of these compounds
has not been elucidated to date, and curcumin may
impact on multiple DNA repair pathways [17]. Pertinent
to the treatment of GBM, the FA pathway is activated
in response to alkylating agents such as Temozolomide
(TMZ) and Carmustine (BCNU; [18]), and previous work
has demonstrated that FA-deficient cells are more sensitive
to TMZ and BCNU than FA-proficient cells [18, 19].
Given these previous findings, we hypothesised that the
FA pathway would not be expressed/active in normal nonproliferative brain tissue, but be re-activated in rapidly
proliferating GBMs. As such, FA pathway inhibition
in aggressive brain tumours may offer an exploitable
therapeutic window to improve the treatment of GBM to
currently used chemotherapeutic agents.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Using both archived and fresh GBM tissue, we
demonstrate that in contrast to normal brain tissue or
benign Schwannomas, the key FA pathway protein
FANCD2 is re-expressed and that the FA pathway is active
in GBMs. Furthermore, expression levels of FANCD2
strongly correlate with tumour grade. We also show that
three separate small molecule FA pathway inhibitors
sensitise GBMs (primary and established cultures) to both
TMZ and BCNU irrespective of MGMT status. Our data
therefore highlights a potential exploitable therapeutic
window to increase the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic
agents used to treat GBM, whilst sparing normal noncancerous brain tissue.

RESULTS
The FA pathway is re-expressed and active
in high-grade GBM, with FANCD2 protein
expression associated with tumour grade
Given that the FA pathway responds to lesions that
impede on-going DNA replication [12], is down-regulated
in differentiated cells [8], expressed in highly proliferative
tissue, but not expressed in normal brain tissue [9, 10];
we hypothesised that FA protein expression would be
elevated in GBM and might potentially correlate with
clinical grade. To test this, we quantified the expression of
the key FA pathway protein FANCD2 [6] in 131 archived
FFPE glioblastoma specimens collected at the Royal
Hallamshire Hospitalâ€™s neuro-oncology department.
As normal brain material is difficult to obtain, benign
schwannomas served as a negative control for these
experiments (Figure 1A). FANCD2 expressing cells were
never detected in schwannomas and only 7% of grade
II oligodendrogliomas exhibited FANCD2 expression
(Figures 1A and 1B). However, 46% and 93% of grade
III and grade IV gliomas respectively stained positive for
FANCD2 expression (Figures 1A and 1B). Comparable
data was obtained using a commercial tissue microarray,
in which normal brain tissue was devoid of any FANCD2
expression, and expression was more prevalent with
increasing tumour grade (Figure 1C). In both experiments
there was a significant association between the presence
of FANCD2 expression and tumour grade (p<2x10-16 and
p<1x10-4 respectively). Given these findings, we attempted
to stratify overall survival of the Grade III patients
with FANCD2 staining, but did not detect a significant
correlation (data not shown). However, this cohort was
very heterogeneous with some patients having undergone
aggressive de-bulking surgery and radiotherapy, while
others having just biopsy. Therefore, given the relatively
small number of cases in this cohort and the differences in
treatment regimes among them, it is perhaps not surprising
that no prognostic correlation between FANCD2 staining
6415

and patient survival could be ascertained at this time.
Consistent with the overall findings in our archived
tissue samples, we observed negligible FANCD2 staining
in one particular low-grade (radiology diagnosis)
oligodendroglioma originally diagnosed in 2011
(supplementary Figure 1B). This tumour was graded WHO
II at biopsy later that year and immunohistochemical
analyses revealed weak FANCD2 expression
(supplementary Figure 1B). This patient was re-admitted
in 2012 with biopsy proven transformation to grade III
anaplastic astrocytoma from which we were again able to
determine FANCD2 expression. Interestingly, the patientâ€™s
grade III tumour exhibited increased FANCD2 expression
compared to the previous biopsy proven lower grade
disease (supplementary Figure 1B). Even with the caveat
that this is a single case, taken together with our analyses
of over 165 normal, benign schwannomas and brain
tumours derived from multiple patients (Figures 1A-C),
our data reveal that FANCD2 expression is significantly
associated with tumour grade. These findings therefore
raise the possibility that the FA pathway is more active
in high-grade gliomas, and may therefore contribute to
chemotherapeutic resistance.
Even though we have determined that FANCD2

expression increases with brain tumour grade, it does
not indicate if the FA pathway is active in these tumours
and could contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance
mechanisms [19, 20]. To determine if the FA pathway is
indeed active in high-grade glioma, we derived primary
cultures from freshly resected grade III/IV gliomas
(supplementary Figure 1C), using previously described
protocols [21, 22]. In agreement with our findings in
archived FFPE gliomas, all successfully established
primary GBM cell cultures to date were found to express
FANCD2 (Figure 1D and data not shown). Importantly,
the FA pathway is active in these cells, as treatment of
these primary cultures with the chemotherapeutic agent
Temozolomide (TMZ) activated mono-ubiquitination of
FANCD2 and re-localisation to nuclear foci (Figures 1D
and supplementary Figure S1D). These are two key steps
in activation of the FA pathway [23], and imply that the
rest of the FA pathway is also expressed to sufficiently
high levels to facilitate FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination/
re-localisation. Overall, these data are consistent with
previous mRNA studies [11], and demonstrate that
FANCD2 protein expression increases with glioma grade
and is active and responsive to chemotherapeutic agents.
Given that normal brain tissue [9, 10], or benign tumours

agents currently used to treat GBM such as the alkylating
agents Temozolomide (TMZ) and BCNU [18], and others
have shown that FA-deficient cells are more sensitive to
these agents than FA-proficient cells [18, 19]. However,
the effects of several commercially available FA inhibitors
(FAPi) in GBM cells have not been determined. We
therefore used the glioma cell lines U87 and U138, which
are respectively proficient and deficient for the FA pathway
[18], to ascertain if FAPi can sensitise GBM cells to the
chemotherapeutic agents currently used to treat high-grade
gliomas. To date, four separate FAPi have been described
that are commercially available; curcumin, its monoketone

cell cultures. A: Representative western blots showing FANCD2 and actin (loading control) expression in U87 (left panel) and U138
cells (right panel). Treatment with Temozolomide (TMZ) activates the FA pathway as evidenced by the appearance of a slower migrating
form of FANCD2 with represents the mono-ubiquitinated form (Ub-FANCD2). Pre-treatment with the indicated that FAPi severely inhibits
FA pathway activation as evidenced by significantly reduced Ub-FANCD2 after TMZ treatment. DMSO treatments were used as negative
controls. To determine FA pathway activation, the normalised ratio of Ub-FANCD2 (L) to FANCD2 (S) (normalised to DMSO+TMZ
treated cells) was calculated for each treatment as previously described [30] and shown under the blots for U87 cells. Note that all values
are zero for U138 cells). As described previously, U138 cells express low levels of FANCD2 and exhibit a defective FA pathway (no UbFANCD2 after TMZ treatment). The FANCD2 antibody recognises a non-specific band in U138 cell line as indicated (n.s. band), which is
most likely due to reduced epitope expression in this cell line. B: Immunofluorescence detection and quantification of cells exhibiting 10

analogues EF-24 & 4H-TTD, and the menadione analogue
DDN [13-16]. However, in initial toxicity studies, we
found that 4H-TTD was toxic to both U87 and U138 cells
even at nM concentrations (data not shown), and was
therefore excluded from our further analyses, as was the
recently reported FAPi Ouabain [24].
Treatment of U87 cells with non-toxic doses of
curcumin, EF-24 or DDN resulted in significant inhibition
of FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination following treatment with
TMZ (Figure 2A). This was accompanied by a concurrent
reduction in the number of cells exhibiting FANCD2
nuclear foci (Figure 2B). Consistent with a previously
reported defective FA pathway [18], the glioma cell line
U138 displayed reduced endogenous levels of FANCD2
and an inability to activate the FA pathway following
TMZ treatments (Figures 2A and 2B). Comparable data
was obtained in both U87 and U138 cells using BCNU
in place of TMZ (supplementary Figure S2A). It is
important to note that the inhibitory effects on FA pathway

activation conferred by curcumin, EF-24 or DDN were
not a consequence of altered cell cycle distribution (data
not shown). As well as serving as an important negative
control for these experiments, the data generated in U138
cells suggest that perturbation to FA pathway activity in
U87 cells was a direct consequence of FAPi treatments,
which was further confirmed using isogenic cell lines (see
later).
To ascertain if FAPi could inhibit the activation
of the FA pathway observed in primary glioma cultures
(Figure 1D), we treated several independently derived
primary GBM cell cultures with TMZ with or without
the prior treatment of FAPi. Consistent with results
obtained in U87 cells, treatment of primary glioma cell
cultures with curcumin, EF-24 and DDN all resulted
in significant inhibition of FA pathway activation in
response to Temozolomide treatments as measured by
both reduced mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 (Figure
2C) and a reduced ability to form FANCD2 nuclear foci

(Figures 2D and S1D). Together with the data presented
in Figure 1, these results provide strong evidence that
unlike normal brain tissue, an active FA pathway is highly
expressed in high-grade gliomas and the use of FAPi may
therefore sensitise these inherently resistant tumours to
chemotherapeutic agents.

(Figure 3A and supplementary Figure S2B). In order to
ascertain if inhibition of the FA pathway would also confer
a chemo-sensitising phenotype to primary glioma cultures,
we repeated these experiments using several primary
glioma cultures derived from fresh tissue (supplementary
Figure 1C). Consistent with data obtained in immortalised
glioma cell lines (Figures 3A and S2B), and with the
fact that FAPi are capable of inhibiting FA pathway
activation in primary glioma cell lines (Figures 2C, 2D
and S1D); pre-treatment with curcumin, EF-24 or DDN
all led to significantly increased TMZ sensitivity in several
independently derived primary GBM cultures (Figure 3B
and supplementary Figure S2C). As with immortalised
glioma cell lines, both EF-24 and DDN were generally
greater chemo-sensitisers than curcumin, which likely
reflects their increased potency to inhibit the FA pathway
[15, 16].
Inherent resistance of high-grade gliomas to
alkylating agents has often been linked to expression of
the de-alkylating enzyme MGMT, which is not expressed
in around half of these tumours [1]. However, conclusive
evidence that such genetic differences account for the
majority of tumour cell responses to such agents is still
lacking and may also be linked to other DNA repair
mechanisms [2]. If inhibition of the FA pathway is to
offer promise as a potential chemo-sensitising strategy,

Inhibition of the FA pathway sensitises
glioblastoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents
irrespective of MGMT status
To determine if inhibition of the FA pathway could
sensitise glioma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, we
carried out cytotoxicity assays, initially using U87 (FA
proficient) and U138 (FA deficient) cells. Cells were pretreated with the FAPi curcumin, EF-24 or DDN, and then
treated with increasing doses of either TMZ or BCNU.
All three FAPi conferred a significant increased sensitivity
to both TMZ and BCNU in the FA-proficient U87 cells
(Figure 3A and supplementary Figure S2B respectively).
Importantly, this increased sensitivity could be mainly
ascribed to inhibition of the FA pathway, rather than
any non-specific activities of the FAPi, as comparable
increased sensitivity was not observed in FA-deficient
U138 cells treated with either curcumin of EF-24, with
only a modest increase observed in DDN treated cells

DISCUSSION

then it is important to determine if they confer this
function irrespective of MGMT status. U87 cells are
MGMT negative and U138 cells are MGMT positive
(supplementary Figure S2D), therefore FAPi are capable
of sensitising MGMT negative cells to both TMZ and
BCNU (Figures 3A and S2B). To determine if they also
act as potent chemo-sensitisers in an MGMT positive
genetic background, we carried out cytotoxicity assays
with the FAPi curcumin in T98G cells, which, like
U87 cells are chemo-resistant, yet are MGMT positive
(supplementary Figure S2D). Pre-incubation of T98G
cells with curcumin, EF-24 or DDN all sensitised T98G
cells to TMZ in a similar manner to that observed in the
MGMT negative cell line U87 (Figure 3C). We therefore
conclude that inhibition of the Fanconi Anaemia pathway
offers promise as a chemo-sensitising strategy irrespective
of MGMT status, which is an important finding for the
future clinical development of FAPi.
The use of FA-proficient and FA-deficient U87 and
U138 GBM cell lines provides strong proof of concept that
the observed increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
agents is specifically due to inhibition of the FA pathway.
However, other genetic differences between these two
cell lines could account for some of the phenotypic
differences observed, as could potential off-target effects
of these FAPi [17, 25]. To provide more conclusive proof
and to act as important tool for the further development
of FAPi, we generated isogenic U87 cell lines that are
proficient or deficient in the FA pathway. To achieve
this, we stably integrated plasmids expressing previously
validated FANCD2-directed shRNA and screened several
clones derived from two independent shRNA or nontargeted control shRNA for FANCD2 levels (data not
shown). A cell line was selected that exhibited minimal
residual FANCD2 expression and severely compromised
FA pathway activation when compared to cell lines stably
expressing non-targeted control shRNA (Figure 4A and 4B
respectively). As in parental U87 cells, pre-treatment with
the FAPi curcumin, EF-24 and DDN sensitised the stable
cell line expressing a non-targeting control shRNA to
TMZ treatments (Figure 4C). Importantly however, these
FAPi had minimal effect of TMZ sensitisation in the cell
line depleted of FANCD2 (Figure 4C). Similar data was
obtained using an additional stable FANCD2-depleted cell
line expressing shRNA targeting a different region of the
FANCD2 mRNA (supplementary Figure S2E). The slight
increased TMZ sensitivity observed in the FANCD2depleted cells following pre-treated with either EF-24 or
DDN likely reflects their more potent activity towards
the residual levels of FANCD2 compared to Curcumin
[15, 16]. Collectively, these findings provide strong proof
of concept data that FAPi could sensitise gliomas to
chemotherapeutic agents by exploiting their heightened FA
pathway expression/activity compared to the surrounding
normal brain tissue.

We report here the first appraisal of the expression
and activity of the FA pathway in high-grade glioma,
demonstrating a strong association between FA protein
expression and clinical grade. Given that the FA pathway
is activated during normal S-phase transit (unperturbed
DNA replication) or in response to replication-blocking
lesions [4, 5, 7], increased FANCD2 expression in highgrade glioma is most likely a consequence of an increased
proliferative index, which also increases with glioma
grade. Indeed, analyses of the proliferation marker Ki67
in GBM tissue micro-arrays agree with this hypothesis
(Figures 1C and S1C). It is interesting to note that in
contrast to these findings, a previous study showed that a
cohort of breast tumours exhibiting reduced cytoplasmic
FANCD2 expression were correlated with poor survival
outcomes [26]. However, our findings are also consistent
with previous reports showing that highly proliferative
tissues such as testis, tonsils and spleen exhibit high
expression of FANCD2 and FANCA, yet non-proliferative
tissues such as lung, liver, muscle and the brain exhibit
minimal expression of these proteins [9, 10]. We also
reveal that FANCD2 expression is negligible in normal
brain tissue, which is consistent with previous findings
that the FA pathway is down regulated in differentiated
cells [8]. Also relevant to our findings is a recent largescale gene expression study which revealed that at least
12 of the currently 16 known FA genes exhibit increased
expression at the mRNA level in GBM compared to
normal brain tissue [11]. Taken together, the data presented
here are in agreement with previous studies and reveal an
exploitable therapeutic window for FA pathway inhibition
in high-grade gliomas. In this regard, and as part of our
on-going studies towards such clinical application of FA
pathway inhibitors, we also report here the first use of
multiple commercially available FAPi (curcumin, EF-24,
DDN) to sensitise glioma cells to chemotherapeutic agents
irrespective of genetic background.
An important aspect to bear in mind when
considering clinical applications of FA pathway inhibitors
is how such FAPi will be delivered to prevent/minimise
possible systemic side effects. The recent interest and
advancements in nano-particles combined with magneticmediated delivery/localisation is a potentially attractive
future approach for drug delivery in glioma. Indeed, it has
been recently reported that curcumin and Temozolomide
could be successfully co-loaded onto such particles and
delivered to both 2D and 3D model cell cultures [27].
Alternatively, oral delivery of an FAPi such as curcumin
may offer a viable and safe delivery mechanism [28],
assuming of course that sufficiently amounts of active
compound at the tumour site could be achieved to confer
a chemo-sensitising effect.
Perhaps the most promising approach would either
be the use of current intrathecal pumps to facilitate
6420

exploitation of the blood-brain barrier to deliver FAPi
directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or alternatively
intratumoural/intracerebral convection enhanced delivery
[29]. Thus, delivery of small-molecule FA pathway
inhibitors directly to the cerebrospinal fluid or directly
into the brain parenchyma may maximise their sensitising
properties at tumour sites, whilst taking advantage of the
blood-brain barrier to retain the FAPi agent to minimise
possible systemic side effects. Such an approach would
therefore facilitate both tumour localisation and reduce
potential undesired side effects.
Given that the mechanisms of action for any of the
commercially available FAPi described here (curcumin,
EF-24 and DDN) are currently unknown; as part of the
future development of more potent and specific FAPi, we
are presently working with medicinal chemists to develop
novel small molecule inhibitors of the FA pathways for
which we know the mechanism of action. The isogenic
FANCD2 proficient/deficient U87 cells lines described
here, along with others that we are presently generating
will be instrumental in determining FAPi specificity and
for target validation studies. To facilitate this potential
future application of FAPi, we are also currently carrying
out in vivo studies based on the promising in vitro findings
presented here, using both commercially available FAPi
and our novel FAPi in combination with chemotherapeutic
agents currently used in the clinical management of highgrade gliomas. Given the poor prognosis of patients with
high-grade gliomas and the current unmet need for new
therapies for this devastating disease, it is hoped that the
data presented here and future in vivo studies will facilitate
the development of an early phase clinical trial to allow
the assessment of the use of FAPi to improve our current
treatment of these tumours.

FANCA (IHC: ab5063, 1:100), FANCD2 (IHC:
ab108928, 1:200; IF: ab2187, 1:1000; WB: ab12450,
1:5000) and MGMT (ab39253, 1:1000), Ki67 (ab16667,
1:100). For Western blotting, primary antibodies were
visualised using HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and antimouse secondary antibodies at 1:5000 (DAKO P0399
and P0447 respectively). For immunofluorescence, antimouse Alexa-488 or anti-rabbit Alexa-594 (Invitrogen)
were used at 1:1000. The FANCD2 antibody for IHC
was optimised using mouse spleen and brain as positive
and negative controls for protein expression respectively
(supplementary Figure S1A) as previously described [9],
together with FANCD2 proficient and siRNA-depleted
cells (data not shown).

Drug treatments

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were treated with Curcumin (5ÂµM), EF24 (31nM), DDN (30nM) 8 hours prior to treatment
with 50ÂµM of either TMZ or BCNU for 24hrs (western
blots and immunofluorescence detection of FA pathway
activation) or 5 days (cytotoxicity assays).

Primary and archived brain tumour samples
Primary brain tumour tissue surplus to clinical
requirements was collected from patients attending the
Neuro-oncology unit at the Sheffield Royal Hallamshire
Hospital, and FFPE tissue was retrieved from the Royal
Hallamshire Hospital diagnostic archive. The research
involving patient material was approved by the Leeds
East Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 11/
YH/0319). The tissue microarray containing both healthy
and cancerous human brain tissue cores was purchased
from Insight Biotechnology. All archived brain tissue
were verified for tumour grade by a consultant pathologist
(MF).

Cell lysis and Western Blotting
For whole-cell extracts, cells were solubilized on
ice for 20 minutes in lysis buffer; 20 mM Tris-HCl pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT and
1 mM EDTA supplemented with 50 U/Î¼l benzonase
(Novagen), protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma).
Cleared lysates were produced by centrifugation of the
resulting samples at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 min at 4Â°C. Gel
electrophoresis was performed using the NuPAGE system
(Invitrogen). Briefly, samples were resolved on 4-12%
Bis-Tris gels in MOPS buffer, transferred to a PVDF
membrane which was then probed for the protein of
interest using antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5%

performed on a Nikon Eclipse T200 inverted microscope
(Melville), equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca ER camera
and a 200 W metal arc lamp (Prior Scientific, United
Kingdom), with a 60X and 100X objective lens. Images
were captured and analyzed using Volocity software
(Improvision).

Immunohistochemistry and scoring
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples
were deparaffinised in 2 xylene baths for 5-10 minutes
each. Slides were then hydrated through descending
grades of ethanol (100% to 70%) for 3 minutes each.
After washing the slides in running water for 5 minutes,
the sections were then immersed in sodium citrate at
pH 6 (Sigma) and microwaved for 3 minutes at high
temperature and 7 minutes at low temperature for antigen
retrieval. The slides were allowed to cool down in solution
and then washed in distilled water for 15 minutes. Sections
were then soaked in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol
at 37Â°C for 30 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase
activity. Following 3 washes in distilled water, slides
were then incubated for 60 minutes in 10 % normal goat
serum (Vector Laboratories) and 10% casein in PBS to
block non-specific binding sites and then probed with the
relevant primary antibodies prepared in PBS containing
2% sera and 2% casein overnight at 4Â°C. Next day, slides
were rinsed in PBS and then incubated for 60 minutes
at room temperature in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) prepared at
1:200 in PBS containing 2% sera and 2% casein. The
antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the
Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) according
to manufacturerâ€™s protocol, followed by staining with
3,3â€™-diaminobenzidin (DAB) peroxidase substrate kit,
(Vector Laboratories). Sections were then counterstained
in Gillâ€™s haematoxylin and dehydrated in ascending grades
of ethanol before clearing in xylene and mounting under
a coverslip using DPX mountant (Fisher). All sections
were verified for tumour grade by a consultant pathologist
(MF), who also marked the tumour area for scoring.
Scoring of FANCD2 staining was carried out blindly by
two independent people (AAP and AR), with positive
staining indicating that â‰¥50% cells in the marked tumour
area had positively stained nuclei. A chi-squared test was
used to test for association with tumour grade.

Flow Cytometric Analyses
Cells were collected using trypsin, pelleted, washed
with PBS, fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and stored at
âˆ’20Â°C for up to 2 weeks. After thoroughly washing with
PBS, to remove any residual ethanol, cells were stained
with a propidium iodide solution (50 Âµg/ml) containing
RNase A (25 Âµg/ml) for 30 min before flow cytometry
was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur
instrument. The percentage of cells in each cell cycle
phase was subsequently calculated using FloJo analysis
software.

Cytotoxicity assays
Cells were plated at a density of between 10002000 cells/well in 96-well plates (depending on cell line),
and the following day treated with appropriate non-toxic
concentrations of FAPi for 8 hours, after which time, cells
were then treated with DMSO, TMZ or BCNU. After 5
days of growth, MTT reagent was added to the cells at
a final concentration of 3 mg/ml, and incubated at 37Â°C
for 3 hrs. The media was removed and replaced with 200
Âµl DMSO to solubilise the formazan product, which was
quantified by determining optical density at 540 nm using
a spectrophotometric microtitre plate reader. Cytotoxicity
was calculated for each treatment by normalisation to
appropriate vehicle only (DMSO-treated) controls.
