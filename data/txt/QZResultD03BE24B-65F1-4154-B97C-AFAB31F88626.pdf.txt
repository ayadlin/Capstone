ABSTRACT
The effects of many chemotherapeutic drugs on ribosome biogenesis have
been underestimated for a long time. Indeed, many drugs currently used for cancer
treatment – and which are known to either damage DNA or hinder DNA synthesis
– have been shown to exert their toxic action mainly by inhibiting rRNA synthesis
or maturation. Moreover, there are new drugs that have been proposed recently for
cancer chemotherapy, which only hinder ribosome biogenesis without any genotoxic
activity. Even though ribosome biogenesis occurs in both normal and cancer cells,
whether resting or proliferating, there is evidence that the selective inhibition
of ribosome biogenesis may, in some instances, result in a selective damage to
neoplastic cells. The higher sensitivity of cancer cells to inhibitors of rRNA synthesis
appears to be the consequence of either the loss of the mechanisms controlling the
cell cycle progression or the acquisition of activating oncogene and inactivating tumor
suppressor gene mutations that up-regulate the ribosome biogenesis rate. This article
reviews those cancer cell characteristics on which the selective cancer cell cytotoxicity
induced by the inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis is based.

INTRODUCTION

appear to reduce the specificity of these drugs for cancer
cell elimination. In fact, unlike DNA synthesis, the
synthesis of rRNA occurs in both proliferating and resting
cells, the latter constituting a large portion of normal
tissues. However, a series of recent results indicated that
- in some instances - a specific, non-genotoxic inhibition
of rRNA transcription may result in a selective damage
to neoplastic cells (reviewed in [8-12]). Data dealing
with the alterations in the relationship between ribosome
biogenesis and cell proliferation, as well as with the
changes in the mechanisms controlling the ribosome
biogenesis rate in cancer cells, may explain the selective
cytotoxicity of ribosome biogenesis inhibitors for cancer
cells [13-17]. These characteristics - which may be of
importance for the selection of an appropriate anticancer
therapy on the one hand, and the stimulation of the
development of specific rRNA inhibitors on the other - are
the subject of this review. For an easier understanding of
the topics discussed, a brief description of the main steps
in ribosome biogenesis and of its relationship with cell
proliferation will be given first.

Many drugs used for treating cancer, such as DNAreactive agents, antimetabolites, and topoisomerase
inhibitors, exert their toxic action by damaging DNA
or hindering DNA synthesis. The rationale for this
chemotherapeutic approach is that DNA integrity and
duplication are crucial for proper cellular function and
proliferation, respectively. In proliferating normal cells,
the damage or inhibition of DNA is sensed by cell-cycle
checkpoint factors that block cell cycle progression,
thus making it possible for the cell to repair DNA before
division (see for review [1-3]). The repair of these
lesions is important in preventing apoptotic cell death.
In proliferating cancer cells these mechanisms frequently
function poorly or not at all [4, 5], so DNA damages
may more often induce cell death [6]. Therefore, these
chemotherapeutic agents may be considered to be more
effective against cancer cells than normal proliferating
cells. On the other hand, these kinds of drugs, apart from
their action on DNA, very frequently also induce an
inhibition of ribosome biogenesis [7]. This fact would

thus consequently ensuring the generation of normalsized, viable daughter cells [45]. In this context, it was
demonstrated that not so much the capacity of protein
synthesis, but rather the production of new ribosomes is
important for cell cycle progression [46], a deficiency in
ribosome biogenesis activating in fact a p53-dependent
checkpoint mechanism [47, 48]. Furthermore, the
relationship between ribosome biogenesis rate and cell
cycle progression was stressed by the finding that an
accelerated or delayed achievement of the appropriate
amount of ribosomes during the G1 phase is associated
with an accelerated or delayed G1/S-phase progression
[49].

Ribosome biogenesis is the result of a series of
coordinated steps that occur in the nucleolus (reviewed
in [18-21]). Within the nucleolus, some ribosomal genes
are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) to produce
the 47S rRNA precursor that is then processed in order
to generate the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA. The 5S
rRNA, which is transcribed in the nucleoplasm by RNA
Polymerase III (Pol III), is imported to the nucleolus. The
assembly of a specific multiprotein complex at the rDNA
promoter containing Pol I is necessary for the initiation
of 47S pre-rRNA synthesis. Within this multiprotein
complex, at least three basal factors - the ribosomal
DNA transcription factor Rrn3 [22] (also referred to as
Transcription Initiation Factor I (TIF-I) A [23]), Selectivity
factor 1 (SL1), and Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) - are
necessary for ribosome gene transcription in mammals
[24].
TFIIIC and TFIIIB transcription factors are
necessary for the transcription of the 5S rRNA by Pol
III [25-27].The ribosomal proteins (RPs), whose mRNA
is transcribed by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), are also
imported to the nucleolus where they assemble with the
rRNAs to form both the large pre-60S and the small pre40S incompletely processed subunits of the final mature
ribosomal subunits. The large 60S subunit contains one
each of the 28S, 5.8S, and 5S RNAs, together with 47
ribosomal proteins, called RPLs, whereas the small 40S
subunit contains only the 18S RNA and 32 ribosomal
proteins, called RPSs [28, 29]. The large and small
subunits migrate to the cytoplasm, where they make up
the final 80S ribosome particle. In proliferating cells, the
ribosome biogenesis rate appears to be regulated by cell
proliferation-controlling processes [30]. During mitosis,
Pol I transcription is repressed by the CDK1-cyclin B
kinase activity, and re-activation of Pol I transcription at
the end of mitosis depends on inhibition of this activity
[31-34]. The RNA-polymerase I upstream binding factor
(UBF), inactive during mitosis and early G1 phase [35], is
phosphorylated by G1-specific cyclin/Cdk complexes thus
stimulating rRNA synthesis during G1 phase progression
[36]. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor Rrn3/TIFIA and of SL1 also correlate with cell cycle fluctuation
of rDNA transcription [24, 37, 38]. Moreover, in cycling
cells, the phosphorylation of the pRb tumor suppressor induced by the cyclin-D-cyclin-dependent protein kinase
(CDK)-4, CDK-6 , and cyclin E-CDK-2 complexes during
the G1 phase - hinders its binding to UBF and TFIIIB,
thus allowing rRNA transcription to increase. In fact,
pRb, in its active, non-phosphorylated form, inhibits
both rRNA synthesis by binding to UBF [39-42] and Pol
III transcription by binding to TFIIIB [43, 44]. Indeed,
an up-regulation of the rate of ribosome biogenesis is
necessary for the enhanced protein synthesis requested by
cells in order to grow in size during the cell cycle phases,

The inhibitors of rRNA synthesis induce apoptotic
death in cancer cells lacking the p53-pRb control
of G1/S phase transition
During cell cycle progression, there are some active
mechanisms that ensure the proper timing of cell cycle
events by enforcing the dependence of late events on the
completion of early events [50]. These checkpoints exert
their function at the G1-S and G2-M phase transitions
by arresting cells which, for any reason, should not enter
the following phase. Inappropriate ribosome biogenesis
appears to be one of these reasons, with perturbed rRNA
processing and ribosome assembly inducing cell cycle
arrest in a p53-dependent manner [47, 51-56]. There is
evidence that any perturbation in ribosome biogenesis
causes p53 accumulation and activation. Indeed, in normal
conditions, the amount of p53 within the cell is very
small due to the fact that p53 is a short-lived protein that
is rapidly degraded by MDM2 (Murine Double Minute
2) and HDM2 in humans, which acts as an E3 ubiquitin
ligase facilitating p53 proteasomal degradation. Ribosome
biogenesis perturbation is responsible for the fact that
several ribosomal proteins (RPs), no longer used for
ribosome construction, may bind to MDM2, thus relieving
its inhibitory activity toward p53 which, therefore,
accumulates within the cell nucleus (reviewed in [57, 58]).
The most important RPs for the inactivation of MDM2
are RPL5 and RPL11 [55, 59-61], which, by forming a
complex with the 5S rRNA bind to and inactivate MDM2,
all the components of the complex being necessary for
the its inhibitory function [62, 63]. Ribosome biogenesis
perturbations block the transition from G1 to S-phase. The
mechanism involved in the block of cell cycle progression
is activated by p53 that induces p21 expression, which
in turn - by hindering pRb phosphorylation - blocks
the activity of E2Fs transcription regulators and the
consequent transit from G1 to S phase [2, 64]. Thus the
activation of the p53-pRb pathway for blocking cell
cycle progression in conditions of insufficient ribosome
biogenesis is an important mechanism for preventing
proliferating cells from dividing without reaching an outfit

of the cell constituents sufficient for daughter cell survival.
Cancer cells are frequently characterized by i) the presence
of activating mutations of gene coding for the components
of the proliferating and growth factor signaling pathways,
ii) the disruption of pRb function consequent to RB1
mutation or deletion, overexpression of cyclin D1, cdk4,
and cyclin E, and INK4a mutation, gene deletion, or
silencing [65, 66], and iii) inactivating mutations of p53
[67, 68]. A frequent effect of these changes is the loss of
a normal G1/S phase checkpoint, with the consequent
loss of the functional relationship between ribosome
biogenesis and cell cycle progression [13, 14]. What were
the consequences of the absence of an efficient G1/S phase
checkpoint in proliferating cells upon ribosome biogenesis
perturbation? Experimental evidence indicates that, in cells
with a normally functioning p53-pRb pathway, the specific
inhibition of ribosome biogenesis induced by Actinomycin
D (ActD) treatment at a dose that selectively blocks the
Pol I-dependent transcription caused an arrest in cell
cycle progression that hindered the cell division with an
incomplete ribosome content [13]. When rRNA synthesis
was resumed, ribosome biogenesis tended to continue
to completion and the cell divided with an appropriate
ribosome content, as demonstrated by the absence of
quantitative changes in the rRNA content in these cells,
even after a 1 h treatment with ActD every day for four
days. In contrast, in the case of cells lacking both p53 and
pRb, the exposure to ActD did not influence the cell cycle
progression for the absence of the activation of the cellcycle check-points [13] , thus leading these cells to divide
without having reached an appropriate ribosome content;

therefore, the progressive reduction in the ribosome
content becomes very quickly incompatible with cell life
(Figure 1). In fact, in this case, after ActD treatment a
progressively increased cell death rate occurred, due to an
increased apoptotic activity, without significant changes
in the cell cycle progression rate [13]. The importance of
the status of the p53-pRb-mediated control of cell cycle
progression in the cell response to chemotherapeutic
agents that hinder ribosome biogenesis was also suggested
by a study on the effects of 5-Fluorouracyl (5-FU) and
methotrexate treatment on human cancer cell lines,
after silencing for RB1 expression. In fact, besides the
effect on DNA synthesis, a major effect of both drugs
is the down-regulation of ribosome biogenesis: 5-FU
by inhibiting rRNA processing, and methotrexate by
inhibiting rRNA transcription [7]. Therefore, the inhibition
of ribosome biogenesis can be considered for a good part
responsible for the effects caused by these two drugs in
cancer cells. Treatments with 5-FU and methotrexate, at
doses and time exposures derived from the evaluation
of the interstitial pharmacokinetics of the drugs in vivo
[69], caused a marked reduction in the RB1-silenced
cancer cell population growth, but not in control cells.
Moreover, a higher death rate was observed in drugtreated RB1-silenced cells than in control cells [14].
Therefore, the deficiency of the pRb and p53 function,
which appeared to give cells an immediate advantage
in maintaining proliferation unchanged after ribosome
biogenesis inhibition, was on the contrary responsible
for the later cell population exhaustion (Figure 1). These
observations taken together indicate that the absence of

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the relationship between cell cycle progression and ribosome biogenesis. When
ribosome biogenesis is adequate, the cell increases in size, passes through the cell cycle phases, and gives rise to two normal daughter
cells A. In the case of perturbed ribosome biogenesis, if the p53-pRb pathway normally controls the G1/S phase checkpoint, the cell cycle
progression is arrested in the G1 phase B. However, if the p53-pRb pathway is not functioning, the cell cycle progression is not arrested and
the cell divides without having reached a sufficient size, thus giving rise to two non-viable daughter cells C.

the p53-pRb mediated check-point control, as it occur in
many cancer cells, may render them more sensitive to the
inhibition of ribosome biogenesis than normal cells. In
other words, the loss of the two major tumor suppressors
is a cancer characteristic that should be exploited in order
to selectively eliminate cancer cells by using inhibitors of
ribosome biogenesis. In support of this statement are some
clinical findings indicating that patients with breast cancers
lacking a functioning p53/pRb pathway and treated with
the adjuvant standard chemotherapy regimen, which
includes 5-FU and methotrexate, had a more favorable
clinical outcome in comparison with patients with cancers
with a normally functioning p53/pRb pathway [14, 15].

suppressor hinders ribosome biogenesis both by inhibiting
UBF recruitment on the transcription complex [78], and
by down-regulating the activity of nucleophosmin, a
multifunctional nucleolar protein involved in rRNA
processing [79]. As for the other major tumor suppressor,
pRb, it inhibits ribosome biogenesis, as reported above
[39-44]. Lastly, Pol I transcription is also repressed
by PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in
chromosome 10), another important tumor suppressor
which activates various signaling events that inhibit cell
proliferation and disrupt the SL1 complex [80]. Therefore,
the claim that a high activity of ribosome biogenesis
characterizes cancer cells appears to be substantiated by
the observation that many of the genetic changes occurring
in cancer cells up-regulate ribosome biogenesis. On the
other hand, there is evidence that the severity of these
changes may be highly variable in human cancers, thus
giving rise to tumors characterized by a highly variable
ribosome biogenesis rate, which is sometimes quite similar
to that of the corresponding normal cells [81]. The highly
variability of the nucleolar size in cancer cells is long since
known [82, 83]. Of importance from the histopathological
standpoint is the fact that the variability in the rate of
ribosome biogenesis is reflected in differently-sized
nucleoli within cancer cells, the size of the nucleolus
being directly related to the rate of ribosome biogenesis
[84, 85]. Accordingly, nucleoli with highly variable size
can be observed in histological sections in the same types
of cancers, either stained with E&E (Figures 2A and 2B)
or with the silver staining procedure selective for nucleolar
visualization (Figures 2C and 2D) (reviewed in [86-88]).

Ribosome biogenesis has a highly variable rate in
cancer cells
It is a common belief that cancer cells are typically
characterized by a higher rate of ribosome biogenesis than
the corresponding normal cells. An up-regulated ribosome
biogenesis in cancer cells may be considered to be the
consequence of the fact that neoplastic transformation
is frequently characterized by changes of protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [5] which activate
mechanisms stimulating cell growth and proliferation , and
also trigger a series of pathways which enhance ribosome
biogenesis [70]. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(MAPK/ERK) pathway activates both Pol I transcription,
through the phosphorylation of UBF [71, 72], and Pol III
transcription, by phosphorylating TFIIIB [21], and ERK
phosphorylates the Transcription Initiation Factor TIF-IA
which links the initiation-competent Pol I entity with the
rDNA promoter [38]. Mitogens and growth factors also
activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which in turn activates
MYC [73], the major modulator of ribosome biogenesis.
MYC increases Pol I activity by enhancing the recruitment
of SL1 to promoters, stimulates ribosomal protein
synthesis by increasing Pol II transcription, and facilitates
Pol III transcription by activating TFIIIB [27, 74, 75].
Furthermore, the mitogenic growth factor stimulation,
through the activation of the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), also induces both Pol I transcription
by activating UBF and Rrn3/TIF-IA (the latter not in
all cell types), and Pol III transcription by facilitating
the association of the transcription factors TFIIIB and
TFIIIC with 5S rRNA genes [18, 76]. Furthermore, there
is evidence that the products of the tumor suppressor
genes that adversely affect cell proliferation and cell cycle
progression also negatively control ribosome biogenesis.
In fact, p53 inhibits both Pol I transcription by binding
to the selectivity factor SL1 - which is necessary for Pol
I recruitment to the rRNA gene promoter [77] - and Pol
III transcription by binding to TFIIIB [44]. In the control
of ribosome biogenesis, p53 may be aided by p14ARF.
In addition to activating the p53 pathway, this tumor

The inhibitors of rRNA synthesis induce apoptotic
death in cancer cells with up-regulated ribosome
biogenesis
This high variability in the ribosome biogenesis
rate in cancer cells has been found to account for a
different sensitivity of cancer cells with functional
p53 to the treatment with inhibitors of rRNA synthesis.
Recent data indicate that cancer cells exhibiting an upregulated ribosome biogenesis are highly sensitive to
drugs inhibiting rRNA transcription or maturation [17].
In fact, it has been shown that the exposure of human
cancer cell lines characterized by different levels of rRNA
transcription to drugs which inhibit rRNA synthesis
induced apoptosis only in the cells with the highest rates
of ribosome biogenesis. Moreover, the cancer cells in
which the high rRNA synthesis was down-regulated by
serum starvation failed to undergo apoptosis after the
treatment with rRNA synthesis inhibitors. The induction of
apoptosis by ribosome biogenesis inhibitors in cells with
high but not with low rRNA synthesis rate was due to the
fact that the level of p53 stabilization and of its activity in
the activation of the target genes responsible for apoptosis

induction were directly related to the rRNA synthesis
rate of the cells before the drug treatment . Apoptotic cell
death is induced only in those cells where a high amount
of p53 is stabilized after rRNA synthesis inhibition. This is
consistent with previously reported data on the relationship
between p53 levels and the induction of apoptosis [89].
Interestingly, the inhibition of rRNA synthesis always
stopped the cell cycle, irrespective of the ribosome
biogenesis rate of cells. The high and low levels of p53
stabilization induced by rRNA synthesis inhibitors were
the consequence of the fact that high and low amounts of
ribosomal proteins, no longer used for ribosome building,
bind to the ubiquitin ligase MDM2, thus hindering p53
ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (Figure 3),
according to the well-established RP-MDM2 pathway that
controls the cellular level of p53 (see reviews in [57, 58]).
The level of p53 stabilization induced by drugs acting in
different ways from the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis,
such as Hydroxyurea [90], was independent of the level of
ribosome biogenesis in cells and lower than that occurring
after the inhibition of rRNA synthesis. Worth of note, in
cells with a low ribosome biogenesis rate, the combined
treatment with Actinomycin D and Hydroxyurea exerted

an additive effect on p53 stabilization, thus succeeding
in the apoptotic pathway activation even in these cells.
The different sensitivity to inhibition of rRNA synthesis
depending on a different rate of ribosome biogenesis
is very likely at the basis of the preferential induction
of apoptosis in tumor cells - when compared to the
normal cells of the same lineage - by the selective rRNA
synthesis inhibitor CX-5461 [10, 91]. CX-5461, a nongenotoxic drug recently undergoing phase I clinical trials
for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, inhibits
ribosome biogenesis, most likely by disrupting the SL-1/
rDNA complex [92, 93]. It has been shown that CX-5461
induced p53-dependent apoptosis of malignant B cells,
but not of normal cells, in a Eµ-MYC mouse model of
Burkitt lymphoma, resulting in an increased survival rate
of tumor-bearing mice [91]. In these mice, B-lymphocytes
constitutively overexpressing MYC are characterized by
an enhanced ribosome biogenesis, due to an increased
rDNA transcription rates and Pol I machinery abundance
[91]. Indeed, MYC controls ribosome biogenesis by
stimulating the synthesis of all three DNA-dependent
RNA polymerases, thus enhancing the synthesis of 47S
pre-rRNA, 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins, which

Figure 3: Schematic representation of the effects of ribosome biogenesis inhibitors on cells with different rates of
rRNA synthesis. Normally, the nuclear p53 level is very low as a consequence of the fact that newly synthesized p53 is rapidly linked

by the oncoprotein MDM2 which mediates the tumour suppressor ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation. In cells with a
low ribosome biogenesis rate, also a low production of ribosomal proteins (RPs) occurs A. In these cells, after the inhibition of ribosome
biogenesis, just a few RPs, no longer used for ribosome building, bind to a very few MDM2 molecules, thus only partially neutralizing
their ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53, with a consequent induction of a low-level p53 stabilization. A low amount of stabilized p53 is
responsible for cell cycle arrest B. In the case of cells characterized by a high ribosome biogenesis rate also a high production of RPs occurs
C. The inhibition of rRNA synthesis causes a large number of RPs, no longer used for ribosome building, to bind and neutralize a large
number of MDM2 molecules, thus inducing a strong p53 stabilization. A high amount of stabilized p53 is responsible for cell apoptotic
death D.

are necessary for ribosome building [94]. That the high
sensitivity to CX-5461 was the consequence of the
activation of p53 was demonstrated by the fact that EµMYC lymphoma cells, with elevated basal rates of Pol
I transcription, mutant or null for p53 exhibited a 180fold decreased sensitivity to the drug [91]. On the other
hand, the lack of cytotoxic effects in normal cells without
up-regulated Pol-1 transcription suggested that the rate of
rRNA synthesis of the cells could account for the different
sensitivity of cancer cells with functional p53 to the
treatment with inhibitors of rRNA synthesis. Therefore,
in tumor cells with up-regulated ribosome biogenesis
consequent to MYC overexpression, the inhibition of
rDNA transcription may well be responsible for a high
accumulation and activation of p53, sufficient for the
induction of apoptosis, whereas it causes only transient
effects in cells with a normally regulated ribosome
biogenesis (Figure 3).

be carried out very easily and should be very useful for
distinguishing those cancers that may benefit greatly from
treatment with ribosome biogenesis inhibitors, resulting in
apoptosis, from those in which the inhibition of ribosome
biogenesis will cause only a cell cycle arrest with a low
chemotherapeutic efficacy. A schematic representation
of the effects of treatment with inhibitors of ribosome
biogenesis in relation to the characteristics of neoplastic
cells is shown in Table 1.

The effect of many chemotherapeutic drugs on
ribosome biogenesis has been underestimated for a long
time. Only recently, it has been shown that the mechanism
of action of many drugs used for cancer treatment is
mainly based on either the inhibition of rRNA synthesis or
maturation [7]. The introduction in cancer chemotherapy
of CX-5461, a molecule which selectively hinders Pol
I activity without exerting any genotoxic activity, may
certainly stimulate more studies aiming to identify and/
or produce compounds that have these characteristics
for targeting the nucleolus in cancer cells [95]. In this
context, worthy of mention are the recent results obtained
using a small molecular compound, BMH-21, and a
small-molecule peptide (22mer) which have been found
to stabilize p53 by inhibiting rDNA transcription. BMH21 binds to GC-rich sequences and inhibits RNA Pol I
activity [96]. It also induces the proteasome-dependent
destruction of the large catalytic subunit in the Pol I
complex, as do three other small molecular compounds,
BMH-9, BMH-22, and BMH-23 [97]. The 22mer targets
the interface between RNA polymerase I and Rrn3
thus selectively inhibiting the synthesis of rRNA [98].
Indeed, the development of similar compounds appears
to be particularly appropriate, based on the evidence that
cancer cells may acquire genetic and metabolic changes
that render them much more sensitive to the inhibition
of rRNA synthesis than normal cells. Considering the
fact that these changes consist of either the loss of the
mechanisms controlling the relationship between cell
growth and cell cycle progression or an up-regulated
ribosome biogenesis, it could be rationally suggested
that a pre-treatment analysis should be conducted on
cancer samples to define the integrity of their mechanism
regulating the G1/S phase checkpoint and to evaluate the
rate of ribosome biogenesis. Such a characterization can
