ABSTRACT
N-myc downstream-regulated gene1 (NDRG1) has been identified as a potent
tumor suppressor gene. The molecular mechanisms of anti-tumor activity of NDRG1
involve its suppressive effects on a variety of tumorigenic signaling pathways.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of NDRG1 in the apoptosis of
colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. We first collected the clinical data of locally advanced
rectal cancer (LARC) patients receiving oxaliplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy
in our medical center. Correlation analysis revealed that NDRG1 positively associated
with the downstaging rates and prognosis of patients. Then, the effects of overexpression and depletion of NDRG1 gene on apoptosis of colorectal cancer were tested
in vitro and in vivo. NDRG1 over-expression promoted apoptosis in colorectal cancer
cells whereas depletion of NDRG1 resulted in resistance to oxaliplatin treatment.
Furthermore, we observed that Bcl-2, a major anti-apoptotic protein, was regulated by
NDRG1 at post-transcriptional level. By binding Protein kinase Cα (PKCα), a classical
regulating factor of Bcl-2, NDRG1 enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of
Bcl-2, thus promoting apoptosis in CRC cells. In addition, NDRG1 inhibited tumor
growth and promoted apoptosis in mouse xenograft model. In conclusion,NDRG1
promotes oxaliplatin-triggered apoptosis in colorectal cancer. Therefore, colorectal
cancer patients can be stratified by the expression level of NDRG1. NDRG1-positive
patients may benefit from oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens whereas
those with negative NDRG1 expression should avoid the usage of this cytotoxic drug.

type of neoadjuvant therapy regimen is still unclarified.
Several randomized trials comparing the efficacy and
toxicities of CRT with or without oxaliplatin (L-OHP), as the
preoperative treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer have
been reported [4-7]. Although the results were inconsistent,
oxaliplatin was still a reasonable candidate for inclusion into

neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, which was further
evidenced by studies demonstrating that oxaliplatin was able
to induce apoptotic cell death in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells
[8, 9]. However, the mechanisms by which oxaliplatin trigger
death signal in cancer cells have not been fully defined yet.
Apoptosis is a morphologically and molecularly
distinct form of programmed cell death. This conserved
cellular suicide program is initiated either ‘intrinsically’[10,
11] through cellular stress that impinge on the mitochondria
or ‘extrinsically’[12, 13] from extracellular ligands
that activate death receptors at the cytomembrane. One
of the most important advances in cancer research is
the recognition that apoptosis is crucially involved in
the regulation of tumor formation and also critically
determines chemotherapy treatment response [12, 14, 15].
Thus, understanding of the molecular events that regulate
apoptosis in response to anticancer chemotherapy, and how
cancer cells evade apoptotic death provides novel insights
for a more rational approach to develop molecular targeted
therapies for combating cancer.
N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) plays
a potent role in modulating metastatic ability in multiple
types of solid tumor including CRC [16, 17], breast cancer
[18, 19] and prostate cancer [20, 21]. Also, NDRG1 has
been linked to many cellular processes including cell cycle,
apoptosis, and cellular differentiation [22-26]. Plenty of
studies indicate that over-expression of NDRG1 is able to
inhibit the invasion and metastasis of CRC. The molecular
mechanism this anti-tumor activity involves its suppressive
effects on several tumorigenic signaling pathways such as
Wnt [27, 28], phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) [29, 30]
and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) [31] pathway.
Moreover, our previous work revealed a significant inverse
correlation of NDRG1 expression with tumor stage,
differentiation status and metastasis in CRC patients,
suggesting the clinical significance of NDRG1[32]. To
date, however, the underlying mechanism by which NDRG1
affects apoptosis has not been fully elucidated. Hence, the
specific functions of NDRG1 in apoptosis need to be further
investigated.

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As shown,
NDRG1 transcript levels were significantly higher in cancer
tissues from downstaging patients relative to those from nodownstaging ones (Figure 1A). Moreover, higher expression
of NDRG1 in downstaging group was further confirmed
at the protein level by western blots (Figure 1B). A tissue
microarray containing specimens from all enrolled patients
was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 1C).
In downstaging group, the positive expression of NDRG1
was detected in 39 cases (67.2%), whereas only 18 cases
(46.1%) showed positive signal in no-downstaging group (R
= 0.210, P = 0.039, Table 1). The detailed clinical information
of each patient was listed in supplementary Table 1.
To further investigate the clinical significance of
NDRG1 in CRC, we analyzed the possible correlation
between NDRG1 expression and clinicopathologic
variables (Table 2). Our data showed a significant inverse
correlation between NDRG1 and tumor size (R = -0.355,
P = 0.001), local invasion (R = -0.318, P = 0.002),
lymphatic invasion (R = -0.287, P = 0.005) and TNM
stage (R = -0.287, P = 0.005). Moreover, Kaplan–Meier
analysis revealed that patients in the NDRG1 negative
group (n = 40) had a significantly poorer overall survival
than those in the NDRG1 positive group (n = 57; logrank = 10.37; P = 0.001; Figure 1D). Additionally,
NDRG1 positive expression was associated with a longer
disease-free survival time (log-rank = 9.974, P = 0.002,
Figure 1E). These findings suggested that NDRG1
positively correlated to the downstaging rate of LARC
patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover,
NDRG1 might function as a potential prognostic marker.

NDRG1 was necessary for oxaliplatin-triggered
apoptosis
To gain insight into the mechanisms of significant
tumor regression in NDRG1-positive patients, we
detected altered activities in several apoptotic pathways
via a pathscan array using protein extracted from selected
specimens. As shown, after two cycles of chemotherapy,
the protein levels of P53, cleaved-caspase-3, and cleavedPARP were dramatically elevated in downstaging
group (Figure 2A), indicating that the remarkable tumor
regression in downstaging patients was due to substantial
apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin. Western blot was
then performed to analyze several apoptosis regulating
factors. Intriguingly, upon the increase of NDRG1, a
loss of Bcl-2 protein was detected in specimens from
downstaging group while protein levels of other molecules
stayed stable (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure
1A), suggesting NDRG1 might promote apoptosis via
targeting Bcl-2, a classical potent apoptosis suppressor. To
investigate the role of NDRG1 in the apoptotic procedure,
we generated HCT116NDRG1 cells stably expressing
human NDRG1 and HCT116shNDRG1 cells depleted
of NDRG1. The magnitude of apoptosis was measured
with western blots. As shown, significant higher levels

RESULTS
NDRG1 positively correlated to the downstaging
rate and prognosis of LARC patients receiving
neoadjuvant chemotherapy
A total of 97 LARC patients were enrolled into our
study. Colonoscopy was performed on each patient to validate
the diagnosis. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy and subsequent
surgical resection, patients were divided into downstaging
or no-downstaging group according to the pathological
staging results. Sixteen patients were randomly selected in
each group. To evaluate the potential effect of NDRG1 on
the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, total RNA
was extracted from cancer tissues and subjected to reverse

of cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP were detected in
HCT116NDRG1 cells (Figure 2C). In contrast, silencing
of NDRG1 resulted in remarkable blockage of apoptosis
(Figure 2C). Similar results were also observed in SW620
cells (Figure 2D). Moreover, the apoptosis induced by
NDRG1 was potentiated by oxaliplatin. After oxaliplatin

treatment, the protein levels of cleaved-caspase-3 and
-PARP in HCT116- and SW620NDRG1 cells were
drastically elevated compared to those untreated whereas
control cells showed moderate elevation (Figure 2C, 2D and
Supplementary Figure 1B, 1C). Additionally, shNDRG1
cells showed negligible signal of cleaved-caspase-3 and

that NDRG1 could increase the sensitivity of CRC cells to

to attenuated response to oxaliplatin (Figure 2E, 2F).
However, ectopic NDRG1 expression could restore the
sensitivity of TP53KD cells to oxaliplatin (Figure 2G,
2H). The results in HT29 cells, a TP53 defective and
oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell line, were similar in the
same experiment setting (Supplementary Figure 2A,
2B). Taken together, these data indicated that oxaliplatintriggered apoptosis depends on NDRG1 instead of TP53.

translation inhibitor, before NDRG1 ectopic expression.
However, Bcl-2 protein level still underwent a fast decline
upon NDRG1 expression (Figure 3A), which indicated
the loss of Bcl-2 was due to enhanced degradation instead
of inhibition of protein synthesis. We then investigated if
Bcl-2 degradation could be modulated by NDRG1. The
pathway through which Bcl-2 degraded was investigated
using both lysosome and proteasome pathway inhibitors.
As shown, the lysosomal inhibitor BafilomycinA1 (BafA)
had no effect on Bcl-2 degradation (Figure 3B) while the
proteasomal inhibitor MG132 reversed the degradation
of Bcl-2 in NDRG1 cells (Figure 3C, 3D). Moreover,
proteins degraded by proteasome system are often first
conjugated to multiple copies of ubiquitin through
covalent binding. To verify the role of NDRG1 in Bcl-2
ubiquitination, immunoprecipitation assay was performed
in NDRG1 over-expression and knockdown cell models.
As shown, NDRG1 over-expressed cells displayed a
much higher Bcl-2 ubiquitination level than control cells
(Figure 4A, 4C) whereas shNDRG1 cells demonstrated the
opposite (Figure 4B, 4D).
Bcl-2 contains 4 conserved homology domains
(BH1–4), among which BH4 containing lysine residues

NDRG1 induced the degradation of Bcl-2 via
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
By blocking polymerization of Bax, Bcl-2 suppresses
apoptosis and contributes to drug resistance in cancer
cells. We first confirmed the counteractive role of Bcl-2
in oxaliplatin-triggered apoptosis in CRC cells. HCT116
cells were transfected with high amount of Bcl-2 constructs
(10μg), and apoptosis was dramatically attenuated
(Supplementary Figure 2C). In addition, the over-expression
of Bcl-2 also suppressed the magnitude of apoptosis in
HCT116NDRG1 cells (Supplementary Figure 2D), further
validated our above-mentioned hypothesis that NDRG1
might promote apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2. Next, to explore
the mechanisms for the loss of Bcl-2 protein, we treated

is very crucial to the process of ubiquitination. To further
confirm our results, the BH4 deletion mutant of Bcl-2 were
constructed and introduced into HCT116 cells. As expected,
the ubiquitination of Bcl-2 was significantly decreased in
mutant cells even after NDRG1 over-expression (Figure 4E).
These results suggested that NDRG1 induced the degradation
of Bcl-2 via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The decrease of
Bcl-2 subsequently resulted in enhanced apoptosis.

Previous studies demonstrated that Bcl-2 underwent
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after inhibition of protein
kinase C (PKC), accompanied with induction of apoptosis
[33]. According to the antagonism relationship between
NDRG1 and PKC family in hematologic malignancy [26],

verify this hypothesis, we treated HCT116 and SW620

PKCα stabilized Bcl-2 and suppressed magnitude of
apoptosis whereas depletion of PKCα resulted in the
opposite (Figure 5B). However, neither over-expression

depletion of PKCα led to enhanced ubiquitination (Figure
5C). Moreover, NDRG1 could reverse the suppression
of Bcl-2 ubiquitination induced by PKCα (Figure 5D).
Therefore, we speculated that NDRG1 might specially
block the effect of PKCα. Subsequently, western blots and
RT-PCR were performed in HCT116 NDRG1 derivates
to detect potential alterations of PKCα. Unfortunately, no
statistic differences were detected in either way (Figure 5E
and Supplementary Figure 2F). Co-immunoprecipitation
assay was finally performed to test potential direct
interaction between NDRG1 and PKCα. As shown,
NDRG1 directly binded PKCα in HCT116 and SW620
cells (Figure 5F). These results indicated that NDRG1
might inhibit PKCα function via direct binding. As
consequences, ubiquitination of Bcl-2 was enhanced and
CRC cells were more sensitive to apoptosis induced by
oxaliplatin.

apoptosis. Accordingly, depletion of NDRG1 led to
accumulation of Bcl-2 and impaired apoptosis. These
data were consistent with our in vitro observations and
suggested that the NDRG1 suppressed tumor growth and
promoted apoptosis in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Even after recommended by guidelines, the
necessity of including oxaliplatin into neoadjuvant
chemotherapy has been controversial. Plenty of clinical
trials concerning rectal cancer patients dominated by
T4 and advanced T3 cases given sequential oxaliplatincontaining preoperative chemotherapy demonstrated high
tumor response rates, prolonged overall survival, and
acceptable toxicity [4, 5, 7]. Yet other researchers [34, 35]
didn’t observe similar promising results, suggesting that
rectal cancer might be biologically heterogeneous with
subgroups eligible for further individualization of therapy.
Our investigation showed that NDRG1 was positively
correlated with the downstaging rates and prognosis of
LARC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Moreover, substantial apoptosis in cancer tissues from
downstaging patients was detected by a pathscan array.
These finding inspired us to focus on the role of NDRG1
in apoptosis.
Apoptosis is one of the major mechanisms of cell
death in response to chemotherapy [36]. Alterations in
susceptibility to apoptosis not only contribute to tumor
development but also can grant resistance to anticancer
therapies. In our study, elevated levels of P53, cleavedcaspase-3 and cleaved-PARP were revealed by pathscan
array. The P53 tumor suppressor protein can induce
expression of numerous pro-apoptotic gene products
which can activate intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic
pathways [37]. Current evidence points toward P53
functioning through transcriptional activation of pro-

NDRG1 inhibited tumor growth and promoted
apoptosis in vivo
Based on our in vitro findings, xenograft model was
established to examine the in vivo effect of NDRG1 by
injecting HCT116NDRG1 or -shNDRG1 cells into nude
mice subcutaneously (Figure 6A). Oxaliplatin (5mg/kg
in 5% glucose solution) was infused from the tail vein to
simulate the neoadjuvant chemotherapy in human rectal
cancer patients. After the infusion, the growth of NDRG1
xenografts was significantly suppressed comparing with
those from mice receiving glucose (Figure 6B, 6C).
Moreover, xenograft tumors formed by control and
shNDRG1 cells still underwent rapid growth even after
drug treatment (Figure 6B, 6C). In addition, the levels of
NDRG1 and Bcl-2 in xenografts were detected by IHC
(Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure 2G) and western
blots (Figure 6E). As shown, expression of NDRG1 was
always associated with decreased Bcl-2 and enhanced

apoptotic target genes that contain TP53 gene binding
sites within their regulatory regions [38]. Of the several
genes to which P53 can directly target, NDRG1 has been
considered to be necessary for P53-dependent apoptosis
in several types of cancer including colorectal cancer
[24]. NDRG1 is a potent metastasis suppressor in multiple
tumor-types [39]. Plenty of studies manifest that overexpression of NDRG1 is able to inhibit the invasion and
metastasis of CRC [40, 41]. In contrast, some studies have
demonstrated that NDRG1 promotes cell migration and
invasion in certain type of carcinoma [42]. Hence, the role
of NDRG1 in the formation, development and treatment of
cancers may depend on tissue-specific molecular profiles
and remains to be clarified. We showed that NDRG1
increased sensitivity of CRC cells to oxaliplatin-triggered
apoptosis. In line with this, knockdown of NDRG1 led to
impaired response to chemotherapy. Moreover, in TP53
defective cancer cells, the ectopic NDRG1 expression
could restore the response of CRC cells to oxaliplatin
treatment. These results indicate that one of the major
mechanisms by which P53 activate apoptotic pathway
is targeting and activating NDRG1. Once NDRG1 is
activated, it is sufficient to maintain the response of cancer
cells to drug-induced apoptosis.
Dysregulation or blockade of apoptosis in cancer
cells represents a potential mechanism of resistance to
anticancer therapies [43, 44]. Given the promoting activity
of NDRG1 in apoptosis, we speculated that there might
be interactions between NDRG1 and other apoptosis
regulating proteins. As expected, the level of Bcl-2,
a potent inhibitor of intrinsic apoptotic pathway [37],
was decreased upon the expression of NDRG1. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in
cancer has been associated with chemotherapy resistance
in various human cancers, and preclinical studies have
shown that agents targeting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members have preclinical activity as single reagent and
in combination with other anticancer drugs [45]. Thus,
NDRG1 may exert its pro-apoptotic function through
down-regulating Bcl-2. It was previously reported that the
posttranscriptional modulation of Bcl-2, mainly through
ubiquitination and phosphorylation, was responsible for
its stability [46, 47]. Bcl-2 was shown ubiquitinated and
rapidly degraded in apoptosis trigged by TNF-α [48]
and UV exposure [49]. Furthermore, attenuation of this
ubiquitination process contributed to chemo-resistance
in cancer cells. Therefore, the process of regulating Bcl2 stability seems to be crucial in sensitizing cancer cells
to chemotherapeutics. In our subsequent investigation, we
focused on the cellular degradative machinery for Bcl-2.
Lysosomal and proteasomal pathways were both explored.
We found that MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, led to
accumulation of Bcl-2 protein in NDRG1-transfected
cells, which suggested the degradation of Bcl-2 induced
by NDRG1 was blocked. Thus, Bcl-2 degraded through
proteasome pathway. Moreover, immunoprecipitation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

assay provided solid evidence that NDRG1 enhanced Bcl2 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.
In the absence of Bcl-2, CRC cells were more sensitive to
oxaliplatin-triggered apoptosis.
It has been reported that that PKC or Erk1/2
prolonged half life of Bcl-2 via phosphorylation of several
sites in Bcl-2 protein [50]. Among several isoforms, PKCα
was proved to suppress Bcl-2 ubiquitination and increased
its stability. We then investigated several potential
mechanisms and finally discovered that NDRG1 might
suppress PKCα function via direct binding. Through this,
NDRG1 could enhance Bcl-2 ubiquitination and promote
apoptosis. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms
through which NDRG1 affects PKCα remains to be
clarified in further studies.
The present study highlights the pivotal role of
NDRG1 in regulating apoptosis of CRC. In summary,
through interacting with PKCα, NDRG1 enhances
the degradation of Bcl-2 and promotes apoptosis in
CRC. In the presence of NDRG1, oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy can yield great killing activity, resulting in
higher downstaging rates and better prognosis of LARC
patients. As far as we are concerned, our study is the
first demonstration that rectal cancer can be stratified by
NDRG1 status in terms of the response to chemotherapy.
These findings provide a novel predictive biomarker for
the treatment of CRC. However, this conclusion needs to
be confirmed in further clinical trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international

Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy was then delivered to
all the patients for two cycles before surgery. Patients
receiving FOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on
day 1, leucovorin 200 mg/m2 on day 1, 5-Fu 400 mg/
m2 intravenous infusion on day 1, then 600 mg/m2/day
continuous infusion for 2 days) or XELOX regimen
(oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1, capecitabine 1,000
mg/m2 bid on days 1–14) were all included. Surgery
was scheduled within 6-8 weeks after the completion of
chemotherapy, and standard TME was then performed.
For each patient, the resected specimen was examined
by two independent pathologists for pathological
staging. The pathological stage was compared with the
pre-chemotherapy stage. Complete regression (CR) was
defined as no cancer cells in the rectal wall or mesorectum
(ypT0N0). Downstaging was defined as achieving some
tumorous and lymphatic regression including CR. Nodownstaging was defined as no difference between prechemotherapy stage and final pathological stage or TNM
stage upgrading during preoperative chemotherapy. All
patients were routinely followed. Sixteen samples were
selected by simple randomization conducted with SAS
software. Protein and RNA for further research were
obtained from specimen of preoperative colonoscopy
biopsy and surgical resection.

plastic dish. The images were captured using an Oddessy
fluorescent imaging system (LI-COR Biotechnology,
Lincoln, NE, USA).

Reagents and anitbodies

Western blot and immunoprecipitation

The Pathscan Sampler Kit (#7851) and Apoptosis
Antibody Sampler Kit (#9930) including anti-cleaved
PARP, anti-cleaved caspase-3, anti-cleaved caspase-8,
and anti-cleaved caspase-9 antibodies were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).
The In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (11684795910) was
obtained from Roche (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Anti-P53
(#2524), anti-Bcl-2 (#15071) antibodies were also
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-NDRG1
antibody (WH0010397M3) was from Sigma Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Anti-PKCα (#2056) antibody
was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. AntiPKCβ (2099) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Oxaliplatin (3422)
was provided by Sanofi (Paris, France). The PKC inhibitor
GO6976 (S7119) was obtained from Selleck (Houston,
TX, USA).

For western blot analysis, cells were lysed in
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 M urea, 5%
β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 1 × protease inhibitor
mixture). The total cell lysates was sonicated and then
centrifuged at 14,000g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove
cell debris. The supernates were then separated in
12.5% SDS-PAGE. Protein levels were revealed by
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method. For Bcl2 immunoprecipitation assay, protein extracts prepared
in lysis buffer (1% CHAPSO, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 × protease inhibitor
mixture) were firstly pre-cleared to reduce non-specific
binding of proteins to sepharose beads. The supernatants
was incubated with Bcl-2 antibody overnight and then with
protein A/G agarose for 4 hours at 4 °C. After washing
five times with cold PBS, the immunoprecipitates was
boiled and subjected to western blot analysis with antiubiquitin antibody. For detecting NDRG1/PKC binding,
5×106 cells were harvested with immunoprecipitation
lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 150 mM NaCl;
1 mM EDTA; 0.5% NP-40; 10% glycerol; 1 mM
PMSF; protease inhibitor cocktail). After sonication,
the lysates were centrifuged (14,000g, 15min) at 4°C.
Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-NDRG1
antibody. After adding protein A/G agarose, equal amounts
of lysates were incubated with NDRG1 antibody or IgG
for 16h. Subsequently, immunoprecipitates were washed
3 times with RIPA buffer. All incubations and washes

Cell culture and transfections
Human colorectal cancer cells HCT116, SW620
and HT29 were from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Standard growth media for HCT116 and HT29
was McCoy’s 5A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
HyClone, Logan, UT, USA). SW620 was cultured in
Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS. All
cells were maintained in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.
For transient transfection, cells were transfected with
pcDNA3.1 (over-expression) or pLKO (knockdown)
plasmids encoding target sequences. For establishment
of stable cell Lines, the stable clones were selected by
puromycin (5 μg/mL) for 2 weeks. Sequences or hairpin
sequences used for construction were listed in Table 3. All
constructs were confirmed by sequencing.
The staging results were determined by two independent
pathologists according to the 7th edition of the AJCC
Cancer Staging system.

Pathscan array
Conducting of pathscan array was strictly followed
the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, the glass slides
containing detecting antibody matrix was prepared and
assembled. Then the blocking buffer was added in each
well and incubated in room temperature for 15 minutes.
After washing, a total protein of 30μg was added in each
well and incubated at 4°C overnight on an orbital shaker.
Then the slide was washed with PBS and placed on a

Immunohistochemical staining

were performed at 4°C with gentle rotation. Proteins were
eluted from beads for western blots.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed
on paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The tissue sections
were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and microwaved-heated
in sodium citrate buffer (10mmol/L, pH6.0) for antigen
retrieval. Then, the slides were incubated with primary
antibody (anti-NDRG1, anti-Bcl-2, or anti-cleaved PARP).
Counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin. The
scoring was carried out by two independent pathologists
blinded to the clinical characteristics of the patients
according to proportion of cell staining (0 = 0%, 1 =
≤ 25%, 2 = 26% to 50%, 3 = 51% to 75%, 4 = > 75%
positive cells) and the staining intensity (0 = no staining, 1
= weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong). Scores of cell staining
and staining intensity were multiplied. An overall score of
≤ 7 was defined as negative, while a score >7 was defined
as positive.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
RT-PCR was performed as we described previously
[41]. The involving primers were as follows: NDRG1
forward: 5’-CTCCTGCAAGAGTTTGATGTCC-3’ and
reverse: 5’-TCATGCCGATGTCATGGTAGG-3’. PKCα
forward: 5’-GTCCACAAGAGGTGCCATGAA-3’ and
reverse: 5’-AAGGTGGGGCTTCCGTAAGT-3’.

Flow cytometry analysis
For flow cytometry analysis, both floating and
attached cells were collected, after washing twice with
ice-cold PBS, cells were resuspended in 400 μl binding
buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM
CaCl2, pH 7.4) and stained with annexin V-enhanced
green fluorescent protein/propidium iodide (PI), using an
annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein apoptosis
detection kit (BD science, UK). After incubation for
15 minutes, the cells were collected and analyzed in a
FACScanflow cytometry analyzer (Beckman, Brea, CA,
USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Both PI- and
annexin V-negative cells (quadrant 4) were intact cells, PInegative and annexin V-positive cells were considered as
early apoptotic (quadrant 3) cells, both PI- and annexin
V-positive (quadrant 2) cells were late apoptotic cells,
PI-positive and annexin V-negative cells were considered
to be mechanically injured (quadrant 1) during the
experiment.

Statistics
SPSS software (version 19.0) was utilized for
statistical analysis. Differences between continuous
variables (protein levels and RNA levels) were compared
using unpaired t test. Relationship between NDRG1
expression and clinicopathologic variables were measured
by Pearson Chi-square (χ2) test. R values were determined
by Spearman correlation analysis. Overall survival was
assessed by Kaplan-Meier method, and difference between
survival curves was determined by using the log-rank
test. Growing curves of xenograft tumors from different
NDRG1 derivates were compared with two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) method. Differences with a P value
< 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.

In vivo studies

Abbreviations

Mice were maintained at the animal experiment
center of Ruijin Hospital under standard conditions
following institutional guidelines. All procedures
were approved by the Institute Ethical Committee
for animal use. A total of 10×106 HCT116NDRG1 or
HCT116shNDRG1 cells along with control cells were
injected subcutaneously into nude mice (male BALB/c
nu/nu nude mice, 4-week-old, 5 per group). To assess the
effect of oxaliplatin on different NDRG1 derivates in vivo,
mice were divided into two groups receiving oxaliplatin
treatment or glucose as a control. Treatments were started
from day 14. The treatment schedule consisted of 2
intravenous infusions, every 2 weeks, 5 mg/kg injection
of oxaliplatin from tail vein each time. The drug dose
was decided on the basis of literature data and results of
our preliminary experiment showing that this dose was
generally well tolerated whereas higher dosages were
associated with death of mice. Tumor size was measured
every 7 days using calipers and tumor volume (V) was
determined by measuring the length and width of the
tumor and using the formula V = (width2 × length) / 2.
