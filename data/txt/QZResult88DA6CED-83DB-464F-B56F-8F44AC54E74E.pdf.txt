ABSTRACT
Herein we show that a majority of human brain tumor samples and cell lines
over-expressed cannabinoid receptor CB1 as compared to normal human astrocytes
(NHA), while uniformly expressed low levels of CB2. This finding prompted us to
investigate the therapeutic exploitation of CB1 inactivation by SR141716 treatment,
with regard to its direct and indirect cell-mediated effects against gliomas. Functional
studies, using U251MG glioma cells and primary tumor cell lines derived from glioma
patients expressing different levels of CB1, highlighted SR141716 efficacy in inducing
apoptosis via G1 phase stasis and block of TGF-β1 secretion through a mechanism
that involves STAT3 inhibition. According to the multivariate role of STAT3 in the
immune escape too, interestingly SR141716 lead also to the functional and selective
expression of MICA/B on the surface of responsive malignant glioma cells, but not
on NHA. This makes SR141716 treated-glioma cells potent targets for allogeneic NK
cell-mediated recognition through a NKG2D restricted mechanism, thus priming them
for NK cell antitumor reactivity. These results indicate that CB1 and STAT3 participate
in a new oncogenic network in the complex biology of glioma and their expression
levels in patients dictate the efficacy of the CB1 antagonist SR141716 in multimodal
glioma destruction.

SIGNIFICANCE
CB1 is implicated in the regulation of cellular processes linked to survival,
proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis in several physio-pathological conditions.
We shed light on previously unrecognized molecular mechanism of CB1-mediated
modulation of human glioma progression and provide the first and original
demonstration of CB1-STAT3 axis as a new target and predictor biomarkers of
the benefit from specific therapies. Indeed CB1 antagonism capable of tumoral

cell division’ control while making the glioma immunovisible and engaging the
immune system to fight it may represent a hopeful alternative to other established
chemotherapeutics. Because different aspects of glioma biology have been separately
targeted with very limited success, we speculate that CB1 inhibitors which enclose in
the same molecule cytotoxic potential and high activity to boost competent immune
surveillance mechanisms, at a degree that seems to be correlated to the levels of CB1
immunoreactivity, might have profound implications for exploring new therapeutic
anti-glioma actions.

be pro-tumorigenic. In support of this, CB1 receptor
immunoreactivity has been correlated with a more severe
form of the disease at diagnosis and poorer outcome in
prostate cancer [7] and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
patients [8]; Messalli et al. have recently proved that
its expression increased from benign and borderline to
malignant epithelial ovarian tumors [9] and further, a high
CB1 receptor immunoreactivity is indicative of a poorer
prognosis in stage II colorectal cancer patients  [10].
As regard to glioma, discrepancies in CB1 receptor
expression were observed by different groups. Held-Feindt
et al. reported no significant change in mRNA expression
of CB1 receptor in glial tumors versus normal tissues [11],
whilst more recently Wu et al. attested an increase of CB1
receptor expression in high-grade glioma, compared with
low-grade glioma and non-tumor brain tissues [12]. In
the light of this background and as CB1 receptor was
recently suggested as a potential oncogene in pediatric
sarcoma [13], its function in glioma progression deserves
much attention. Indeed the evidence that the endogenous
ligand anandamide is founded upregulated in glioblastoma
brain tissue [14] suggests that the endocannabinoid system
may be over-activated in cancer, leading us to investigate
the therapeutic exploitation of CB1 receptor inactivation
as a promising anti-glioma strategy. In particular,
SR141716 is a potent and selective CB1 receptor
antagonist. Interestingly, besides its antagonist properties
SR141716 can exert also inverse-agonist effects exhibiting
a significant anti-tumor action in thyroid, mantle cell
lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, leukaemia, breast and colon
tumors both in vitro and in vivo [15–20] while its complete
functional significance in glioma has remained not fully
explored, especially for its immunomodulatory effects.
The highly lethal nature of glioblastoma suggests
that the levels of immunogenic signals by glioma
cells are to low to induce an antitumor immunity.
Then, among potential novel therapies, combined
chemoimmunotherapy remains an attractive approach
for GBM patients. Recent studies have shown that GBM
may be vulnerable to elements of the innate immune
system through its expression of several MHC class
I-like stress-associated molecules, such as MHC class
I chain-related proteins A and B (MICA/B) and human
cytomegalovirus membrane glycoprotein (UL-16)-binding
proteins [21]. These antigens are recognized by Natural
Killer (NK) cells via the stimulatory receptor NK group 2
member D (NKG2D) using innate mechanisms that are

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal disease
characterized by uncontrolled cellular proliferation,
diffuse infiltration, a tendency for necrosis, significant
angiogenesis, intense resistance to apoptosis, and
widespread genomic aberrations. Despite years of research
in anti-tumoral therapeutic strategies, malignant glioma
remains one of the most aggressive forms of cancer,
with a median survival after resection, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy of 12–15 months [1]. To improve
the treatment outcome of this devastating disease, new
therapies are then urgently needed.
The ubiquitous regulatory action of the
endocannabinoid system in health and disease emphasizes
the role of this endogenous system in several physiopathological processes and makes its pharmacological
manipulation a promising strategy for the management
of many different diseases, including cancer. Indeed,
this system, composed of cannabinoid receptors CB1
and CB2, their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids,
eg, anandamide) and the enzymes for their metabolism,
has been shown to be involved in the control of
proliferation, migration, and invasive behavior of a wide
variety of tumor types [2]. In glioma the engagement of
CB receptors by THC and other cannabinoid agonists has
been reported to inhibit tumor growth in animal model
through a well established mechanism of action that seems
to be active in patients, too [3]. However little is currently
known about the biological role of the endocannabinoid
system in cancer physiopathology and many basic
questions remain unanswered.
In the central nervous system the main effects of
the endocannabinoid system rely on the activation of
CB1, a 7-transmembrane-domain protein belonging to
the Gαi protein-coupled receptor family (GPCR) which
to date has been shown to be involved in memory and
learning processes, in diseases affecting movements,
mood and anxiety and in conditions related to altered
brain reward mechanisms [4]. It is also expressed and
functional active in neuronal progenitors, where it
regulates cell proliferation and differentiation [5–6].
Some studies showed that the endocannabinoid tone
and CB1 receptor expression are higher in tumor tissues
than in non malignant tissues; additionally this trend
has been associated with disease severity and outcome,
suggesting that an altered endocannabinoid tone may

MHC-independent and do not require prior antigen
exposure or priming [22]. Thus, the immunity to glioma
may be boosted by achieving high levels of activating
NKG2D ligand on the surface of cancer target cells. In
the last few years, increasing evidence have indicated
that efficient chemotherapeutic agents can induce specific
immune responses that result in immunogenic cancer
cell death or immunostimulatory side effects [23]. In this
study we found an upregulation of CB1 in human glioma
tissues and primary cell lines which correlates with the
activity status of STAT3. Moreover, the inactivation of
this oncogenic axis directly affects human glioblastoma
and also stimulates NK cell-mediated antitumor effects.
Indeed, according to the role of STAT3 in the promotion
of survival and proliferation, but also in the immune
escape of cancer cells, SR141716, besides a direct
antiproliferative potential, specifically induces expression
of NKG2D ligand MICA/B in malignant but not in
healthy neuronal cells, leading to a specific stimulation of
NK-antitumor immune response at a degree that seems to
be correlated to the levels of CB1 immunoreactivity.

of CB1. SR141716 was used in the subsequent experiments
at the efficacious concentrations of 10 and 20 μM. At
first, we investigated cell cycle distribution following
SR141716 treatment for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 1C, the
percentage of cells in G1 phase was significantly higher
in U251 glioma cells treated with SR141716 (10–20 μM)
than in untreated cells. Furthermore, a marked reduction
of the cell population in the S phase was observed after
SR141716 treatment, reaching its significance only at
the highest dose of 20 μM. However, no significant
differences in G2/M population were found. These results
suggested that the antiproliferative effects of SR141716 in
U251 cells can be related to a G1/S transition inhibition.
Indeed, in SR141716-treated cells the protein levels of G1/
S-specific Cyclin D1 were selectively reduced compared to
control, with no detectable effect on the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p27kip1 (Fig. 1D). To assess whether the
inhibition of cell proliferation by SR141716 was also
associated to the induction of apoptosis, we performed
a cytofluorimetric cell death analysis by Annexin-V and
propidium iodide staining. We observed a slight increase
in apoptosis induction in glioma cells treated with
SR141716 20 μM (Fig. 1E, upper panel). Accordingly,
in control glioma cells and U251 treated with the lowest
dose of SR141716 (10 μM), we didn’t detect processed
caspase-3. On the contrary, in response to SR141716
20 μM, caspase 3 was cleaved into the intermediated p20
form and its active p17 subunit after 48 h of treatment and
sustained until 72 h (Fig. 1E, lower panel). As expected the
broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely
inhibited apoptosis induction (Fig. 1F, left panel) and
caspase activation (Fig. 1F, right panel) in response to
72 h treatment with SR141716 20 μM. Taken together, the
results illustrate that SR141716 affects glioma cell growth
through the inhibition of cell-cycle progression and the
induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis at the highest
concentrations.

RESULTS
The pharmacological inactivation of CB1
receptor by SR141716 induces apoptosis
through G1 phase block in human
glioma cell lines in vitro
We examined the protein levels of CB1 and CB2
receptors in 4 different glioma cell lines (U343, U251,
U87, T98) and in normal human astrocytes (NHA)
as their normal counterpart. The results showed that
protein expression of CB1 receptor was up-regulated
in all glioma cell lines tested compared with normal
astrocytes. Conversely, CB2 immunoreactivity varied
without a specific trend between normal and malignant
cells (Fig. 1A). The altered expression of CB1 in glioma
cells allowed them to be selectively targeted by CB1
receptor antagonist SR141716, whose pharmacological
and biological effects we sought to explore. First, all
glioma cell lines and NHA were incubated with increasing
concentrations of SR141716 (0.3–40 μM) in time course.
Specifically after 72 h-treatment, SR141716-exposed
glioma cells showed a dose-dependent inhibition of
proliferation compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1B).
In particular, a clear reduction of proliferative rate
became more apparent at a concentration of 20 μM, as
demonstrated by the BrdU incorporation assay. Of note,
SR141716 elicited no significant reduction of NHA
proliferation as compared to cancer cells in the same
condition. To gain better insight into the biological
processes modulated by SR141716 treatment in glioma
cells, U251 cell line was used as a model system for further
studies, as this cell line is one of the most aggressive
glioblastoma cell lines with a considerable expression

Exposure to SR141716 renders U251 glioma
cells more susceptible to NK cell-mediated
cytotoxicity through the upregulation of
the NKG2D ligand MICA/B
These observations, along with previously
published data by our group [15–19], raise the concern
that a potential antitumor effect might be ascribed to
SR141716 in the context of glioma. Increasing evidence
indicates that cancer cell perturbation induced by
chemotherapeutic agents promote antitumor immune
responses and contribute to their full clinical efficacy.
To characterize if SR141716 was able to regulate
immune surveillance mechanisms, we analyzed the
effect of SR141716 treatment on the expression of NKcell-activating ligands on U251 glioma cells and in turns
on NK cell recognition and cytotoxicity against these
cancer cells as target.

First, we monitored by flow cytometry the cell
surface expression of the NKG2D ligand MICA, MICB,
ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3, ULBP4 and MHC class I on
untreated and SR141716-treated U251 glioma cells at
24 h to exclude that the possibility of observed effects
are linked to the stress of dying cells. FACS analysis
revealed that U251 cells expressed the different antigens at
various levels, showing high level of MHC class I antigen
expression. We found that the incubation with SR141716
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced a substantial and selective up-regulation of MICA
and MICB surface expression on U251 cells (Fig. 2A,
upper histograms). Importantly, MHC class I surface
expression was not altered by SR141716 treatment
demonstrating that the observed changes were not due
to an unspecific effect of the compound. The observed
increase in MICA/B expression was both in terms of
percentage of positive cells and Mean Fluorescence
Intensity (MFI) (Fig. 2C), leading us to verify that a

possible mechanism underlying MICA/B upregulation
on U251 cells could be the consequence of an increased
mRNA expression. Indeed, we found a significant increase
of either MICA and MICB mRNA levels in treated cells
with, as expected, no significant effect on the other
NKG2D ligand mRNA levels (Fig. 2A, lower panel).
It is of importance that, in contrast to the effects on
cancer cells, MICA and MICB, in terms both of protein
surface and mRNA levels, on NHA were not affected by
SR141716 treatment (Fig. 2B), suggesting that SR141716
was able to specifically upregulate “danger signals” for
NK cells in malignant but not in healthy cells. Then, it was

still important to verify the functionality of MICA/B and
further investigate if the SR141716-dependent increase in
MICA/B expression could enhance NK cell recognition
and killing of U251 glioma cells. As expected, treatment of
U251 cells with SR141716 significantly increased specific
killing (Fig. 2D) and production of IFN-γ by co-cultured
NK cells (Fig. 2F), when compared with the cytotoxicity
and cytokine secretion of control untreated cells. These
increases were significantly dependent on MICA/
B-NKG2D interaction, because considerably reduced in
the presence of a blocking anti-MICA/B mAb, whereas
isotype control had no significant effects (Fig. 2E–2F).

Of note, MICA/B-blocking mAbs didn’t affect basal cell
lysis, indicating that constitutive NK cell degranulation
and U251 glioma cell lysis probably does not involve
NKG2D activating receptor.
These preliminary results therefore indicate
that SR141716 might have additional therapeutical
immunomodulation properties related to the specific
increase of MICA/B expression.

4–6 mm in diameter, 12 mice in SR141716 group
received each the peritumoral injection of SR141716, at
1mg/Kg/dose, while 12 mice in control group received
vehicle alone (PBS). We recorded the tumor sizes on the
first day of SR141716 treatment (day 1) and biweekly
at the indicated time points. The peritumoral injections
of the drug were then repeated two times a week for
4 weeks. As results, all of the mice in vehicle (control)
group developed tumors beyond 200 mm3 on average
by day 37. In contrast, the mice in SR141716 group
developed much smaller tumors (Fig. 3A). Specifically
on day 34, 37, 41, the mice in the SR141716 group
had significantly smaller tumor sizes compared with
the mice in the control group. Furthermore, after
35  and 41 days from treatment beginning, 4 animals
for each group were sacrificed for immunohistological
analysis that revealed that SR141716 upregulated the
expression of MICA in the tumor xenograft compared
to the control  group (Fig.  3B). Bar graphs in lower

analyses.

To evaluate SR141716 efficacy also in vivo, we
tested SR141716 effect on glioma tumor growth in a
subcutaneous xenograft model. The U251 cells did not
show a considerable tumorigenicity in nude mice in the
initial attempts to establish xenograft model. Thus, we
used U87 cells because this cell line has been widely used
due to their higher tumorigenicity reported in nude mice.
U87 cell suspension was injected s.c. into nude
mice and when the tumor size reached approximately

CB1 is highly expressed in brain tumor samples
and patients’ primary glioma cells

As control, CB2 receptor levels did not show any apparent
differences between normal and malignant tissues and/
or association with tumor grade and were lower than CB2
expression in NHA cells (Fig. 3D). Then we addressed the
functional relevance of this molecular finding, verifying if
the results achieved for SR14176-treated U251 cells were
also true for the primary cell lines established from fresh
resectioned tumors of selected individual glioma patients.
Preliminary FACS analysis suggested a similar overlapping
phenotypic profile of all patients’ derived primary cells used
and U251 for comparison, corroborating that they had the
features of human glioma cells (Fig. 4A-4D). After verifying
the expression of CB1 and CB2 in the 7 established primary
cell lines (Fig. 4E), we then moved to select individual
glioma patient-derived cells with different CB1 receptor
protein levels to characterize their sensitivity to SR141716
treatment on the basis of these receptors levels. Interestingly
the primary cell lines derived from high receptor levels
tumors (GBM17, GBM18) were more susceptible to the
growth inhibiting effects of SR141716 than those derived
from low to moderate receptor levels tumors (GBM25,
GBM27) (Fig. 4F). These preliminary observations support
that CB1 strongly positive cells are more likely to respond
to SR141716 treatment in vitro.

As a new potential chemotherapeutical agent with
combined anti-glioma action we then sought to verify the
clinical relevance of SR141716 in terms of real sensitivity to
its growth inhibiting and immunomodulatory effects. Since
CB1 receptor is the most relevant pharmacological target
of SR141716, we looked for a possible correlation between
receptor expression levels in patients and drug activity. First,
we examined the expression pattern of CB1 in gliomas, by
extracting total RNA and proteins from 23 primary glioma
samples, among which there were grade II, grade III, and
grade IV glioma tissues, compared with normal human
astrocytes. To avoid confounding effects of therapy, only
samples from treatment-naïve patients, that is without
prior radiation therapy and chemotherapy, were considered
(Supplementary Table 1). Real-time PCR and Western blot
analysis were then performed to evaluate gene expression
and protein profiles. The results showed that mRNA and
protein expression of CB1 was upregulated in glioma tissue
compared with NHA (Fig. 3C–D). A strong positive signal
of CB1 was found in almost all glioma tissues, whereas an
almost undetectable level of CB1 in NHA was observed.

of a blocking anti-MICA/B mAb was achieved (Fig. 5I).
These data suggest that the augmented expression of MICA
in high-CB1-expressing cell lines treated with SR141716
enhances NK cell activation and killing but we cannot rule
out the effect of SR141716 on other molecules or ligands
that can modulate NK cell recognition for the control of
low grade malignancy.

Next we verified if the results achieved for
SR14176-treated U251 cells were also true for the
patient derived primary cell lines and significantly
differ between high- and low-CB1-expressing cells.
First, given that anti-proliferative activity of SR141716,
we hypothesized that SR141716 might also regulate
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF–β1) production,
a cytokine upregulated during gliomas malignant
progression. In particular TGF-β1 isoform may contribute
to tumor pathogenesis by direct support of tumor
growth, self-renewal of glioma initiating stem cells
and stimulating expression of the vascular endothelial
growth factor as well as the plasminogen activator
inhibitor and some metalloproteinases that are involved
in vascular remodeling, angiogenesis and degradation of
the extracellular matrix [24–25]. All these promoted the
investigation of SR141716 effects on TGF-β1 levels in our
expermental model. Really we noticed a decreased level of
TGF–β1 secretion in supernatant of high-CB1-expressing
cells after treatment with SR141716 but not in that of lowCB1-expressing primary cell lines in the same conditions
(Fig. 5A). TGF–β1 also interferes with several mechanisms
of anti-tumor immune responses and selectively downregulates MICA expression [26]. Accordingly the
incubation with SR141716 induced a substantial and
selective up-regulation of MICA/B surface expression in
high- but not in low-CB1 expressing primary cell lines
(Fig. 5B). In particular, as reported for one representative
patient primary cell line, belonging to the responsive
high-CB1 group (GBM17), SR141716 treatment mainly
upregulates the basal expression of MICA, at both mRNA
(Fig. 5D) and surface protein level (Fig. 5C) with less
pronounced but equally significant effects also on MICB
(Fig. 5C–5D). At the immunofluorescence analysis, a
weak MICA expression was detected on untreated glioma
GBM17 cells while, of course, it was much higher after
24 h treatment with SR141716 (Fig. 5E). Surprisingly, we
did not observe any significant differences in the degree
of specific killing and production of IFN-γ by NK cells
in the coculture with high- and low-CB1-expressing cells
treated with SR141716. In fact, a slight difference in the
degree of IFN-γ production was observed between the two
different groups even though it failed to reach statistical
significance (Fig. 5H) and of note, accordingly SR14176
treatment increased susceptibility to NK cell killing of both
high (Fig. 5F) and low receptor levels cell lines (Fig. 5G)
when compared with the cytotoxicity of control untreated
cells. However only for high-CB1-expressing cell lines
the increase in NK cell lysis was significantly dependent
on MICA/B-NKG2D interaction; indeed in GBM17
patient primary cell line (high-CB1-expressing) but not in
GBM25 patient primary cell line (low-CB1-expressing)

Pathway activation signature of SR141716
effects in human glioma: a role for STAT3
Finally we investigated the cell signaling pathway
that might mediate the response to SR141716. Since active
STAT3 in tumors influences tumor survival, angiogenesis,
metastasis, chemoresistance and immune evasion, too, we
finally looked for a regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation
targeted by CB1 inhibition. Indeed, either for Glycogen
Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3β)-catenin pathway either,
more recently, for the transcription factor STAT3 a role in
the regulation of MICA/B expression has been described.
Thus we investigated the possible effects of SR141716
on modulating GSK-3β and STAT3 activity in our
experimental model starting from U251 glioma cell lines,
while confirming it in high- and low-CB1-expressing
primary cells. First western blot analysis showed that the
treatment with SR141716 can increase the expression of
MICA, by selectively reducing Tyr705 phosphorylation of
STAT3 in U251 cells (Fig. 6A), with no detectable effect
on signal pathway activated by GSK-3β activity, evaluated
by measuring the phosphorylation of GSK3β and β-catenin
expression. As shown in Fig. 6A and in accordance to the
biological effects observed, all these molecular events
were already evident after exposure to SR141716 for 18 h
and more pronounced after 24 h. These preliminary results
therefore indicate that SR141716 might really have dual
combined activity on tumor growth and immunogenicity
by a mechanism that can involve STAT3. Interestingly,
this previously unrecognized finding in cancer cells,
highlighted a new potential oncogenic network that led us
to investigate STAT3 activity status in our tumor samples
correlating them to CB1 expression levels. Interestingly,
a strict and unexplored directionality CB1→STAT3 was
found both in almost all tumor tissues (18/23) (Figs. 3D
and  6B) and in patients primary cell lines where the
levels of active STAT3 expression followed those of CB1
(Figs. 4E and 6C). Surprisingly a gradually higher CB1
expression was found from peripheral to central tissue of
the dissected tumor from one representative patient and
these levels inversely correlate with STAT3 activity status
(Fig. 6D). To corroborate these findings we then conducted
western blot analysis after 24 h treatment with SR141716
on 2 primary glioma cell lines characterized by the
highest CB1 expression (GBM17, GBM18) and on 2 lowCB1-expressing cell lines (GBM25, GBM27). Specifically,
we paid our attention on previously highlighted

low-CB1-expressing primary cell lines. Finally, since
overexpression of CB1 correlated with STAT3 activity in
almost all brain tumor tissues and GBM primary cell lines
analyzed, we determined if inactivation of CB1 by siRNA
knockdown reversed this finding. U251 and GBM17 cell
lines transfected with CB1 siRNA showed considerably
less active STAT3 compared to cells transfected with
scrambled siRNA (Fig. 6F). Overall these data point out
to CB1-STAT3 as a new oncogenic molecular activation

signature that might differentiate, alone or together
with other possible regulatory elements, the response to
SR141716 of high-CB1 from low-CB1 expressing cells.

DISCUSSION
Our findings provide new insight into the
physiopathology of the endocannabinoid system and
in particular of CB1 receptor signaling, strengthening
15473

Oncotarget

the new concept of CB1 as positive modulator of cell
proliferation and immune escape in glioma. Indeed,
proliferation-promoting functions of CB1 receptors
have been already reported in neurogenesis, that is
impaired in mice lacking CB1 and in wild-type mice
administered with CB1 antagonist, implying that an
endogenous signaling through this receptor promotes
basal levels of neurogenesis in vivo [27]. In line with this,
an antiproliferative action of CB1 antagonism in thyroid,
mantle cell lymphoma, colon and breast cancers [15–20],
as well as in adipocyte and in hepatic myofibroblast has
been demonstrated [28–31]. Of note, our group also
provided evidence that CB1 receptor inactivation inhibits
angiogenesis that contributes to the growth and survival of
the most aggressive and vascolarized cancers [19].
In this study, we present previously unrecognized
functions of SR141716 in multimodal anti-glioma action.
Here we report the upregulation of CB1 in human glioma
tissues and primary cell lines where a surprising ability of
SR141716 to interfere with common oncogenic processes
related to cell cycle progression, apoptosis and immune
escape is highlighted. Indeed, in addition to the direct
cytotoxic and antiproliferative effect in established U251
glioma cell line and primary tumor cells, SR141716
also improves the immunorecognition of cancer cells by
inducing the NKG2D ligand MICA/B. The documented
efficacy in growth inhibition in glioma xenograft
corroborated the chemotherapeutic potential of this CB1
antagonist bringing an interesting new dimension to the
use of this class of drugs as effective anticancer agents.
The in vivo major drawback in glioma therapy is, in fact,
the lack of complete eradication, leading to the selection of
resistant cancer cells and, as a consequence, combinatory
treatment targeting glioma cells in different ways probably
represents a more fruitful approach. In this context, the
documented cytotoxic potential and high activity to boost
competent immune surveillance mechanisms of SR141716
may represent a hopeful alternative to other established
chemotherapeutics. The uncovering of STAT3 as a target
of SR141716 activity, which we believe is novel in cancer,
constitutes the molecular bases of this dual activity
enclosed in SR141716 molecule and highlight CB1STAT3 as a potential new oncogenic axis in the complex
glioma biology.
Indeed, SR141716 impacts U251 and primary
glioma cells growth and MICA/B expression through the
specific inhibition of activated STAT3, a transcription
factor harboring both oncogenic and immunosuppressive
functions [32–34]. Of note the treatment of U251 glioma
cell line with SR141716 is able to reduce the expression
levels of the cell cycle regulator Cyclin D1 (Fig. 1D), of
the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL (Supplementary Fig. 1)
and the TGF-β1 production (Fig. 6A), all canonical
targets of a deregulated STAT3 transcriptional activity
in the process of carcinogenesis and tumor survival [34].
At the light of these findings the inhibition of STAT3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activation might really account not only for removal
of STAT3-mediated repression of MICA [33], but also
for drug effects on glioma growth and apoptosis, even
though we cannot rule out an antiproliferative effect of
SR141716 probably via TGF-β signaling blockage. Indeed
preliminary results showed that SR141716 inhibited also
phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 (Supplementary Fig.  2),
central mediators of signals from TGF-β receptors.
However because TGF-β signaling pathways can be
Smad dependent or independent, these new findings, even
though intriguing and exciting, need to be extensively
underpinned in the next future.
The recent evidence that deletion of mouse
astroglial CB1 receptors impairs leptin-mediated STAT3
activation [35], along with that electroacupuncture (EA)
pretreatment enhances active form of STAT3 via CB1
receptor to protect against cerebral ischemia [36], support
our findings corroborating the CB1-STAT3 axis as a
new potential oncogenic network in brain that deserves
much attention in the near future. Up to now our data
highlighted, indeed, that a strict directional correlation
between CB1 and STAT3 was found both in almost all
tumor tissues (18/23) and in all patients primary cell lines
where the levels of phosphorilated-STAT3 followed the
trend of the CB1 expression (Figs. 3D and 6B, Figs. 4E
and 6C), suggesting that Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3
in these cells may be dependent on the signaling through
this G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), in line with CB1
receptor knockdown experiments too (Fig. 6F). In support
of this new perspective, several examples exist of GPCRs
with transforming abilities, when overexpressed, in NIH
3T3 fibroblast model, for example, the MAS oncogene
[37] and serotonin 1c receptors [38]. CB2 has also been
described as a new transforming GPCRs in several human
myeloid cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) samples where it has been found aberrantly
upregulated [39]. Accordingly since SR141716 acts as a
CB1 antagonist with properties of inverse agonism only
when its target is tonically activated, we hypothesize that
in pathological setting, as brain cancer, the deregulated
activity of this GPCR may turn on oncogenic signals
that interfere with normal proliferative response and
immunesurveillance mechanisms. Indeed glioma patient
samples reported high levels of CB1 expression, compared
with NHA. Of interest, the extent of CB1 but not CB2
receptor protein expression was related with tumor
malignancy. Thus a glioma grade II patient (relapsefree survival 38 months) and an astrocytoma grade II
(relapse free survival) had lower levels of CB1, whereas
most of glioblastoma IV patients, with recurrence of the
tumor within 9 months from surgery, had high levels of
CB1 (Supplementary Table 1). The tumor established
primary cell lines confirmed the high levels of CB1
expression compared with normal human astrocytes
(NHA), reinforcing the pertinence of the model used
for testing SR141716 effects. However, endogenous
15474

systems that become dysregulated in cancer can be
useful pharmacological targets and predictor biomarkers
of the benefit from specific therapies as for example the
biochemical evaluation of ER or of ERBB2, which predict
the benefit from endocrine therapies and trastuzumab,
respectively, in breast cancer. In our experimental model
the careful selection of individual primary cancer cells
with different CB1 receptor expression enables us to verify
the CB1 dependency of SR141716 effects. Interestingly,
we found that the degree of CB1 expression conferred
a different sensitivity to SR141716 treatment, being
CB1 strongly positive cells more likely to respond to
SR141716 treatment in vitro than cells derived from low
to moderate receptor levels tumors. Although this finding
can be suggestive of a CB1 dependency of SR141716
activity, we cannot rule out its off-target effects, too. In
our experimental model SR141716 showed its efficacy at a
concentration of 20 μM that is reported to be non selective
for CB1 receptor only. At this dose, SR141716 can produce
also modulation and internalization of GPR55 [40], an
orphan G-protein linked receptor that appears up-regulated
in aggressive manner in some cancer-derived cell lines
and play a pivotal role in the control of cancer cell fate
[41–42]. Very recently, Moreno et al. described that GPR55
and CB2 can form heteromers in cancer cells and that
both receptors co-participate via direct receptor-receptor
interaction in the control of tumors growth [43]. Receptor
heteromers involving the sister CB1 receptor have been
the focus of intense research. To date CB1 has been
shown to interact with other GPCRs, including dopamine
D2 receptors and adenosine A2 receptors simultaneously
[44], opioid receptors [45], orexin OX1 receptors [46],
and angiotensin AT1 receptors [47]. Intriguingly a recent
paper by Kargl et al., reported that in HEK293 cell model
CB1 receptor can physically interact with GPR55 and
modulate each other signaling properties [48]. Specifically
GPR55 signaling is inhibited in the presence of SR141716
inactivating-CB1 receptors, highlighting an important
cross-antagonism action for this molecule. On the other
hand, the findings that the high selective CB2 antagonist
SR144528 did not affect glioma cells proliferation in the
same experimental conditions used for CB1 antagonist
SR141716 (data not shown), excluded its non specific
effects on CB2 receptors. Accordingly to the new strict and
previously unexplored directionality CB1→STAT3, in our
experimental model the differential effect of SR141716
on primary glioma growth occurred in concert with the
differential changes of CB1 expression in tumor tissues
and consequently with basal activated STAT3 levels. The
only apparent paradox of the same degree of susceptibility
of high- and low-CB1-expressing tumor cells to NK cellmediated killing  (Fig. 5) could be explained through
the possible induction of other NK activating factors by
SR141716 treatment. In this respect apoptosis proteome
profiler array analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1) showed
that SR141716  killing of U251MG in vitro, at least in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

part, is dependent on induction of tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and its ligand
death receptor 4 (DR4). NK cells are known to express
functional TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand [49] and
it is indeed possible that a part of the enhanced NK lysis
we observed after SR141716 is caused by induction of
DR4 or other member of this family on the target cells for
the control of low grade malignancy. Additionally, STAT3
has been shown to act also as a transcriptional repressor
of p53 [50] that, apart from its cell-autonomous effects,
activates the innate immune response against cancer cells
stimulating the expression of ULPB2 [51], in human tumor
cells of different origin and so, the lower level of active
STAT3 found in low-CB1-expressing tumor cells may
be responsible of a major amount of this immunogenic
ligand on their cell surface. Overall regarding the potential
patient stratification, CB1 detection alone or combined
with other conventional biomarkers may allow to select
which particular individuals are potentially responsive
to drug administration. Taking all this in account, our
findings showing a direct and NK-mediated antitumor
effect exerted by SR141716 in glioma cells, its proved
efficacy in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3A), the weak and poor
effects on healthy brain cells (Figs. 1–2) and the well know
pharmacological ability to penetrate throughout the CNS
and blood-brain barrier are adjunct values that may led to a
renewed interest toward SR141716 as a chemotherapeutic
agent capable of inducing multimodal glioma destruction.
Because different aspects of glioma biology have been
separately targeted with very limited success, we speculate
that to obtain significant clinical results a great therapeutic
effort should be aimed to found new compounds which
enclose in the same molecule cytotoxic potential and
high activity to boost competent immune surveillance
mechanisms. As here showed, CB1 antagonism capable
of tumoral cell division’ control while making the glioma
immunovisible and engaging the immune system to fight
it may represent a hopeful alternative to other established
chemotherapeutics approaches.

fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
against CD56, CD3, CD69, as well as the corresponding
isotype immunoglobulin of control (BioLegend, San
Diego, CA, USA). For the evaluation of MICA/B
expression, U251 cells and GBM primary glioma cell lines
were plated into p60 tissue culture plates at a densities
of 20 × 103 cells/cm2 and were allowed to grow for 24 h.
Afterwards cells were washed with PBS and treated with
vehicle or test substance in complete medium. Following a
24 h incubation period, immunofluorescence staining was
performed. Briefly 2 × 105 tumor cells were stained with
the indicated MICA-, MICB-, MICA/B-, MHC class I or
ULBP1–4-specific mAbs or the respective isotype controls
followed by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were fixed in
1% formaldehyde for data analysis. Sample fluorescence
was measured by the Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter
FACScalibur apparatus (Becton Dickinson, USA) and
data were analyzed by using the Cell- Quest Pro software
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data are expressed as
logarithmic values of fluorescence intensity.

cell growth was expressed as a percentage comparison
with the untreated control cells.

Immunofluorescence staining

Quantitative assessment of apoptosis of U251
glioma cell lines was analyzed by anti-human Annexin V
(BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and PI staining.
Briefly, cells grown in 100-mm dishes for 72 h in EMEM
containing 2% FBS were harvested with trypsin and
washed in PBS. The cells were resuspended in Annexin
V binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7; 140 mM
NaCl; and 2.5 mM CaCl2) and stained with Annexin
V-FITC for 20 min at room temperature (RT) and then
with PI at RT for additional 15 min in the dark. The cells
were acquired by flow cytometer within 1 h after staining.
At least 10, 000 events were collected, and the data were
analyzed by Cell- Quest Pro software (Becton Dickinson,
San Jose, CA). Data are expressed as logarithmic values
of fluorescence intensity.

Cell cycle analysis
U251 glioma cell lines were plated in 100-mm
dishes. To synchronize cells at the G1/S interface, they were
serum starved in medium with 0.5% serum for 18 h. Cells
were treated with SR141716 (10 and 20 μM). After 48 h,
the cells were collected, fixed in 70% ethanol, and kept at
–20°C overnight. Propidium iodide (PI; 50 μg/ml) in PBS
containing 100 U/ml DNase-free RNase was added to the
cells for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were acquired
by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA). The analysis was performed with ModFit
LT v3.2 (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME,
USA); 10, 000 events, corrected for debris and aggregate
populations, were collected.

Apoptosis analysis

GBM primary cell lines were plated on slides in
12 well plates at a densities of 10 × 103 cells/cm2 and
were allowed to grow for 24 h. Afterwards cells were
washed with PBS and treated with vehicle or SR141716
in complete medium. Following a 24 h incubation period,
cells were fixed with 4% parafolmadehyde (PFA) for
15 minutes, washed and blocked with 4% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were
then incubated with anti-MICA primary antibody (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) at final concentration of 20 μg/ml at 4°C
overnight. Immunofluorescence staining was obtained by
incubating for 90 minutes with Alexa Fluor® 488 donkey
anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (A21206, Molecular
Probes®) at final concentration of 2 μg/ml. The nuclei were
counterstained with DAPI (1:2000) (Molecular Probes®Invitrogen, Paisley, UK ) and slides were mounted using
Mowiol Coverslip Mounting solution for Fluorescence
Microscopy (Fluka, – through Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St Luis,
MO, USA). Cells were examined under fluorescent
microscope and then analyzed through cellSens Imaging
Software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells using
TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementary DNA
(cDNA) was transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), starting from
1 μg/μl of high pure RNA and samples were tested in
triplicate using the SsoFast EvaGreen reagents (Bio-Rad).
Primer sets were the following:
MICAFw–GACTTGACAGGGAACGGAAA,
MICARev–CAGGTTTTGGGAGAGGAAGA;

Determination of glioma cell proliferation
Glioma cells or normal human astrocytes (NHA)
(4 × 103/well), were cultured for 24 h into 96-well
plates before addition of SR141716 at the indicated
concentrations and cultured for additional 72 h at 37°C.
Cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring BrdU
incorporation into DNA (BrdU colorimetric assay kit;
Roche Applied Science, South San Francisco, CA, USA).
Newly synthesized BrdU-DNA was determined on an
ELISA plate reader (ThermoScientific) at 450 nm. All

BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells were treated in
triplicates and ELISA were done in duplicates for each
cell sample.

Western blot (WB) analysis
For analysis of protein levels from cells they
were grown in p60 tissue culture plates at a density of
2 × 104 cells/cm2 for 24 h. Tumor cells were then incubated
with vehicle or SR141716 as indicated in the text. After
incubation cells were washed with PBS, harvested and
lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
150  mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic
acid, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Tumor pieces were
disrupted for protein extraction by gentle homogenization
(Potter-Elvehjem Pestle) in cold RIPA buffer. After
removal of cell debris by centrifugation (14, 500 g for
20  min at 4°C), the proteins were estimated and then
analyzed using the protocol described elsewhere [53].

Flow cytometric assay of NK-cell cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity assays were performed using the
fluorescent carboxy-Fluorescein Diacetate c’FDA NK
assay in which cell lysis was analyzed by flow cytometry
using the protocol described elsewhere [52]. Briefly, U251
or primary glioma target cells, stimulated as indicated
in the text, were labeled by incubation at 1 × 106/ml in
PBS with 3 μM c’FDA (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK). IL-2 activated effector NK cells were mixed
with and titrated on the target cells and incubated at 37 ̊C
in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 4 h. In blocking
experiments, LEAF™ purified anti-human MICA/
MICB (6D4) and LEAF™ purified Mouse IgG2a κ as
isotype control were added at 10 μg/ml 2 h before starting
co-incubation effector:target and maintained in culture
for additional 4 h till to the end of the experiment. All
determination were made in triplicate, and E:T ratios
ranged from 6:1 to 1:1, as indicated.

Mice experiments
We used U87MG cell line in the tumor xenograft
models because this cell line has been widely used due to
their tumorigenicity in nude mice. The U251MG cells did
not show any tumorigenicity in nude mouse in the initial
attempts to establish xenograft model.
Athymic CD1-deficient nude mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany).
Female mice of 6–8 weeks old were used in all the
experiments. The experiments were performed according
to NIH guidelines, Guide for the care and Use of
laboratory Animals. Mice were bred at Animal research
Facility of Biogem scarl, Institute for Genetic Research
‘‘Gaetano Salvatore’’, (Ariano Irpino Avellino, Italy) in
accordance with Institutional Statement for the Use of
Animals in cancer research.
U87 luciferase expressing glioblastoma cells
(luc-U87) were furnished by Biogem scarl. Before
the implant the cells were expanded, evaluated for
contaminations and vitality, counted and resuspended in
M199 medium. Cells were inoculated subcutaneously
(s.c) on the right flank region at a concentration of
5  ×  106/100  μl/mouse. Treatments began 9 days after
injection. The day before the first administration
(day  -1) mice were subdivided in tumor volume (TV)
homogeneous groups of treatment, (N = 10–12 each) in
the following experimental groups: control (peritumoral
injection of vehicle, 2  times a week for 4 weeks) and
SR141716 (peritumoral administration of 1mg/Kg
SR141716, 2 times a week for 4 weeks). Mice were daily
monitored for clinical signs and mortality. Body weight
recordings were carried out biweekly. Tumor growth was
monitored biweekly with a Mitutoyo caliper. The formula
TV (mm3) = [length (mm) x width (mm)2]/2 were used,
where the width and the length are the shortest and the

Determination of IFN-γ and TGF-beta1
levels by ELISA
For IFN-γ secretion measurement, human purified
NK cells were stimulated with IL-2 (100 IU/ml). After
72 h, activated NK cells were washed twice and mixed
with untreated or SR141716-treated glioma target cells
in 200 μl of complete medium. Cells were incubated
for the indicated time. Thereafter, supernatants were
collected and stored at -20°C pending measurement. The
concentration of IFN-γ was measured by ELISA assay
according to manufacturer’s specification (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN). For TGF-beta1 secretion measurement,
human primary glioma cell lines were plated into p60
tissue culture plates at a densities of 20 × 103 cells/cm2
and were allowed to grow for 24 h. Afterwards cells
were washed with PBS and treated with vehicle or test
substance in complete medium. After 24 h supernatants
were collected and stored at -20°C pending measurement.
The concentration of TGF-beta1 was measured by ELISA

Immunohistochemistry
Criosections (0, 7 mm) of luc-U87 explanted
masses prepared at day 35 and 41 were fixed in acetone
and blocked with 2% normal rabbit serum and 2% BSA.
Tissue sections were stained with antibodies (1:50) to
MICA ( Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). A biotinylated
anti-rat secondary antibody (Zymed, San Francisco, CA)
was used at 1:150. Avidin-biotin complex was added, and
the staining was developed with diaminobenzidine.
For the evaluation of MICA staining, a score
combining the staining intensity and distribution was
used. Staining intensity and the distribution for MICA
was scored as 0 (no staining), 1 (predominantly unstained
with smaller stained areas), 2 (stained and unstained areas
are about equally large), 3 (predominantly stained tissue
with smaller unstained areas), 4 (all xenografted cells
are moderately stained), and 5 (all xenografted cells are
strongly stained). The MICA staining score are the mean
values of five to eight scored samples of tumor tissues
belonging to each group [54]. Slides were scored without
any pre-clinical information, and the final immunostaining
score reported was the average of two independent
pathologists, both with experience in the IHC analysis.
