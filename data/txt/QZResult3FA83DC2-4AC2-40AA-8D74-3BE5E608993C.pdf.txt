ABSTRACT
Castration-resistant prostate cancers still depend on nuclear androgen receptor
(AR) function despite their lack of dependence on exogenous androgen. Second
generation anti-androgen therapies are more efficient at blocking nuclear AR;
however resistant tumors still develop. Recent studies indicate Src is highly active
in these resistant tumors. By manipulating AR activity in several different prostate
cancer cell lines through RNAi, drug treatment, and the use of a nuclear-deficient AR
mutant, we demonstrate that androgen acting on cytoplasmic AR rapidly stimulates
Src tyrosine kinase via a non-genomic mechanism. Cytoplasmic AR, acting through
Src enhances laminin integrin-dependent invasion. Active Matriptase, which cleaves
laminin, is elevated within minutes after androgen stimulation, and is subsequently
shed into the medium. Matriptase activation and shedding induced by cytoplasmic AR
is dependent on Src. Concomitantly, CDCP1/gp140, a Matriptase and Src substrate
that controls integrin-based migration, is activated. However, only inhibition of
Matriptase, but not CDCP1, suppresses the AR/Src-dependent increase in invasion.
Matriptase, present in conditioned medium from AR-stimulated cells, is sufficient to
enhance invasion in the absence of androgen. Thus, invasion is stimulated by a rapid
but sustained increase in Src activity, mediated non-genomically by cytoplasmic AR,
leading to rapid activation and shedding of the laminin protease Matriptase.

disease [4, 5]. The critical role of AR is further supported
by the fact that more potent second generation antiandrogen therapies are able to extend patient survival.
Unfortunately, even these therapies are still not curative.
Studies with the new anti-androgen agent MDV3100
(enzalutamide) indicate one of the ways it inactivates AR
nuclear activity in the tumor cells is by preventing nuclear
translocation, thus retaining a significant amount of AR
the cytoplasm [6, 7]. Several steroid receptors, including
AR, are reported to have non-nuclear (aka non-genomic)
signaling functions in the cytoplasm independent of
their transcriptional activity [8–13]. These non-nuclear
signaling mechanisms are associated with rapid responses
(within minutes) of steroid stimulation. One common
target of steroid receptor nongenomic signaling is the

INTRODUCTION
The survival of malignant tumors arising from the
prostate gland is dependent on the androgen receptor
(AR), a classical nuclear steroid receptor that binds
androgen and activates gene transcription [1, 2]. This
dependence on androgen is exploited therapeutically;
patients presenting with metastatic disease are treated
with anti-androgen therapies that effectively lower
circulating androgen levels and cause tumor regression.
However, patients typically relapse within one to two
years and develop castration-resistant disease in which the
tumors no longer respond to androgen ablation therapy
[3]. Nonetheless, AR itself is still critical as demonstrated
by its retention, mutation, and amplification in resistant

non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src [14–17]. Activated Src
correlates with resistance to MDV3100 (enzalutamide) in
castration-resistant patients [18]. Thus, it is necessary to
understand how Src promotes castration-resistant disease.
Src is a prototypic member of the non-receptor
protein tyrosine kinase family (SFK) up-regulated
or hyper-activated in a high percentage of human
cancers [19, 20]. SFK activation and signaling is highly
associated with bone metastasis in breast and prostate
cancer [21, 22]. Inhibition of Src and Lyn with dasatinib
decreased prostate cancer growth and lymph node
metastasis in AR-independent and -dependent xenograft
models [23]. In vitro, Lyn was required primarily
for tumor cell growth, while Src was responsible for
promoting cell migration. The specific effect of Src on
migration is not surprising given that many Src substrates,
such as FAK, Cas, and cortactin, are intimately involved
in promoting cell motility through integrin-mediated
adhesion to extracellular matrices [17, 21].
Src is activated nongenomically in cells by
progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and
AR, via interactions between the Src SH3 domain and
a PXXP-containing scaffold protein, NMAR/PELP, that
binds steroid receptors via LXXLL motifs. Alternatively,
the Src SH3 domain binds directly to the PXXP motif in
AR or PR [14, 15]. Assembly of Src-containing ER and
AR complexes activates MAPK signaling to stimulate
cell proliferation and castration-resistance [24, 25]. ER,
acting through Src to activate ILK1 was recently shown
to be responsible for enhancing breast cancer invasion
and metastasis [26]. While several studies independently
linked increased invasion and metastasis with elevated AR
or Src activity [27, 28], the specific role of cytoplasmic
AR signaling via Src to promote prostate cancer migration
and invasion was not reported.
We previously demonstrated that AR activation in
prostate cancer cells increases integrin α6β1 transcription
and expression [29, 30]. During that study, we also observed
that AR activation induced morphological changes in the
cells. We hypothesized that AR contributes to prostate
cancer cell migration and invasion, possibly through
stimulation of integrin α6β1 transcription. As described
herein, we identified an AR-dependent non-nuclear signaling
pathway, independent of integrin α6β1 transcription, leading
to Src activation and subsequent cleavage and shedding of
Matriptase, required for prostate cancer invasion.

and PSA expression. During those studies we observed
marked changes in cell morphology in the AR-expressing
cells compared to the parental vector cells (PC3-Puro).
To quantify these differences, PC3-Puro and PC3-AR
cells were plated on laminin and immunostained to
visualize actin structures. There was a marked increase
in cell spreading on laminin by the AR-expressing
cells compared to the vector cells (Figure 1A), which
was accompanied by an 8-fold increase in filopodial
structures (Figure 1B). The observed increase in filopodia
formation specifically in PC3-AR cells correlated
with a 22-fold increase in Boyden chamber migration
(Figure 1C) as well as a 3- to 4-fold increase in Matrigel
invasion (Figure 1D) compared to PC3-Puro vector cells.
Furthermore, inhibiting AR activity with Casodex or
RU486 attenuated the AR-specific increase in Matrigel
invasion (Figure 1D). Complementary experiments were
conducted using LNCaP and C4–2 cells which express
endogenous AR. In LNCaP and C4–2 cells, stimulation of
AR with R1881 increased Matrigel invasion 3- and 2.4fold respectively (Figure 1E). Conversely, AR suppression
using siRNA decreased Matrigel invasion stimulated by
R1881 (Figure 1F). We previously demonstrated that AR
transcriptionally induces integrin α6β1 expression [29].
However, blocking integrin α6 or α3 expression alone
did not block invasion (not shown). Depletion of both
laminin integrins, α3 and α6, was required to suppress
Matrigel invasion 4-fold (Figure 1G). Thus AR promotes
the migration and invasion of prostate tumor cells through
Matrigel via either of two laminin-specific integrins.

AR stimulates Src activation
Src is a major effector of cell spreading, migration,
and invasion [19, 20]. Therefore we investigated Src
activation and expression in the PC3-Puro and PC3AR cells. We found elevated Src expression as well as
increased Src activity in PC3-AR cells as measured by
anti-phospho-[Y416]-Src antibody (Figure 2A). Inhibiting
AR expression in PC3-AR clones with siRNA decreased
Src activation, but not total Src (Figure 2B) demonstrating
AR regulates Src activation but not its expression.
Stimulating LNCaP or C4–2 cells with R1881 for twenty
minutes was sufficient to increase Src activation, but
did not change Src expression (Figure 2C). Conversely,
inhibiting AR expression with siRNA in LNCaP and
C4–2 cells suppressed Src activation in response to
R1881 (Figure 2D). Similarly, suppressing AR activation
in PC3-AR cells with RU486 or Casodex suppressed
Src activation (Figure 2E). Thus, AR is required for Src
activation in several different prostate tumor cell lines.
Inhibiting Src with siRNA did not alter AR
expression (Figure 2F) indicating Src is downstream of AR.
AR stimulates integrin α6 [29], which could activate Src.
However, inhibiting integrin α6 expression with siRNA
did not change Src activity or expression (Figure 2G).

RESULTS

invasion via laminin integrins

Src is also not involved in AR-dependent survival
signaling, since suppressing Src expression with siRNA in
PC3-AR clones caused no increase in cell death (Figure
2H). Treatment of PC3-Puro or PC3-AR cells with RU486
or Casodex also did not induce cell death (not shown). Thus
AR, independently of its actions on integrin α6 expression
or cell survival, stimulates Src activity.

cell-associated (cell lysates) and shed (conditioned
medium) Matriptase were measured by immunoblotting
with an antibody that recognizes the 72kDa transmembrane
and 60kd shed fragments. PC3-AR cells displayed elevated
levels of cleaved cell-associated Matriptase compared to
PC3-Puro cells (Figure 4A). Suppression of AR in PC3AR cells using a tetracycline-inducible shRNA decreased
cleaved Matriptase expression (Figure 4B). Interestingly,
despite non-detectable AR expression in PC3-Puro
cells, a low level of cleaved Matriptase was detectable
in the medium and more was released after 2 hours of
androgen stimulation. In contrast, cleaved Matriptase was
constitutively shed into the medium of PC3-AR cells. PC3
cells are reported to express low, but unstable levels of
AR [36, 37]. Low levels of steroid receptors are often not
sufficient to stimulate transcription, but are still capable
of mediating nongenomic signaling. That androgen
rapidly increases shedding of cleaved Matriptase in PC3Puro cells suggest a possible non-nuclear mechanism
for Matriptase activation when AR expression is low. To
test this, we measured cleaved cell-associated and shed
Matriptase in PC3 cells expressing the NLS or LBD AR
mutant following R1881 stimulation. PC3-AR∆NLS,
but not PC3-AR∆LBD, cells induced the accumulation
of cleaved cell-associated and shed Matriptase within
20 minutes following androgen stimulation (Figure 4C).
Thus, the AR-dependent increase in cleaved Matriptase
requires ligand binding, but not nuclear activity.
In complementary experiments with LNCaP and
C4–2 cells, Matriptase shedding was observed 24 hours
after androgen stimulation (Figure 4D). Cell-associated
cleaved Matriptase was elevated within twenty minutes of
ligand stimulation (Figure 4E) and remained elevated for a
few hours, but by 24 hours its levels decreased while shed
Matriptase levels increased (Figure 4F). Thus, androgen
initially stimulates Matriptase cleavage within the cell,
and that cleaved Matriptase is subsequently shed into the
medium. The increase in cleaved Matriptase within 20
minutes of androgen stimulation was resistant to mRNA
synthesis inhibition by Actinomycin D (Figure 4G)
indicating androgen stimulates this rapid Matriptase cleavage
independent of transcription, further supporting a rapid nonnuclear action of AR on Matriptase. Suppressing Src activity
with dasatinib or two different Src shRNAs decreased the
androgen-dependent induction of Matriptase cleavage in
C4–2 cells (Figure 4H, 4I). Thus, the ability of AR to induce
Matriptase cleavage and shedding is dependent on Src.
Altogether these data indicate AR signaling through Src via
a ligand-dependent, but non-nuclear, mechanism is required
to stimulate Matriptase cleavage and induce its shedding.

AR and Src are required for invasion
To determine if AR-dependent stimulation of Src
is responsible for the increase in invasiveness, cells were
transfected with scrambled or specific siRNAs directed
towards AR or Src. Inhibition of AR or Src expression
attenuated PC3-AR invasion 3- to 4-fold; similar to levels
seen in PC3-Puro control cells (Figure 3A). Inhibiting
Src expression in LNCaP, C4–2, or VCaP cells with the
siRNAs or with individual independent shRNAs similarly
decreased R1881-stimulated Matrigel invasion 2.5- to 3-fold
(Figure 3B, 3C). To assess whether AR stimulates Src activity
and invasion via a non-nuclear mechanism, Src activation
was measured in PC3 cells expressing AR with a mutated
nuclear localization sequence (AR∆NLS) or AR with a
mutated ligand binding domain (AR∆LBD) (Figure 3D). As
described previously, the AR∆NLS mutant is cytoplasmic
while the AR∆LBD mutant is predominantly nuclear, and
both expressed at the same levels as wild type AR in the
PC3 cell lines [29, 31, 32]. Src activity and expression were
elevated in all AR-expressing mutant cell lines, similar to that
seen in PC3-AR cells. Cells expressing the AR∆NLS mutant
also displayed increased Matrigel invasiveness compared to
vector control cells, which was suppressed 2.5- to 2.8-fold
when Src was inhibited with siRNA (Figure 3E). However,
despite elevated levels of Src expression and activity in the
AR∆LBD mutants, their invasiveness was unaffected by Src
inhibition (Figure 3F), indicating that AR ligand binding
activity may be crucial for Src-dependent invasion. Thus, the
ability of AR to promote Src-dependent invasion occurs via
a non-nuclear, but ligand-dependent mechanism.

AR stimulates Matriptase cleavage and its
extracellular shedding via a non-nuclear
mechanism
Matrigel invasion requires proteolytic degradation
of laminin substrates; therefore, we measured expression
of the active form of the laminin protease Matriptase
[33–35]. Matriptase is activated by autocatalytic cleavage
of the 95kDa zymogen into a transmembrane 72kDa
fragment tethered by a disulfide bond to the active
enzymatic domain [35]. The active transmembraneassociated protein is then shed as a ~60kd fragment
tethered to the active enzyme. Thus, both the cleaved
cell-associated and shed enzymes are active. PC3Puro and PC3-AR cells were stimulated with R1881
for 20, 60 or 120 minutes and the amounts of cleaved

tyrosine phosphorylation of cleaved CDCP1 (Figure 5A).
Inhibition of AR or Src expression with siRNA, or treatment
with the Src inhibitor dasatinib prevented cleavage and
tyrosine phosphorylation of the cleaved fragment (Figure
5A). While dasatinib can target other Src-related tyrosine
kinases as well as some receptor kinases, it abrogated
generation of the CDCP1 cleavage product (72kDa) and
its phosphorylation to a similar extent as the Src siRNA
(Figure 5A). Conversely, treatment of C4–2 cells with
R1881 rapidly increased CDCP1 cleavage and tyrosine
phosphorylation (not shown). However, inhibition of
CDCP1 expression (Figure 5B) had no effect on invasion
(Figure 5C). Although Src activation by AR is able to
induce cleavage and phosphorylation of CDCP1, this target
is not critical for AR-dependent invasion of Matrigel.

always maintained at low passage and grown only in
charcoal stripped serum for cultivation to prevent over
activation of AR, which often inhibits proliferation as
seen in other PC3-AR models. The level of AR expression
in these clones was not excessive; comparable to that
seen in LNCaP cells as demonstrated previously [29].
LNCaP, C4–2, and VCaP cells that express endogenous
AR require androgen to be transcriptionally activated.
The advantage of the PC3-AR model is that we were able
to express a mutant of AR that is defective in nuclear
localization, and thus lacks transcriptional activity, or is
defective in ligand binding [29, 31, 32]. Thus, we were
able to demonstrate that Src and Matriptase activation
and shedding occurs via a nongenomic mechanism, i.e.
independent of AR nuclear activity. Additional support
for the nongenomic mechanism was afforded by the fact
that androgen stimulation of PC3 control cells that do not
express detectable levels of AR also stimulates cleaved
Matriptase shedding; consistent with the observation
that low levels of AR that are not sufficient to activate
classical transcriptional responses, are sufficient to
activate cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways. We
used the androgen responsive lines to demonstrate the
AR/Src invasion pathway is also active in androgenresponsive cells. The nongenomic aspects of AR, Src,
and Matriptase activation in these cells were evidenced
by a rapid response occurring independently of new
mRNA synthesis. The lack of dependence of this invasion
pathway on the AR-dependent integrin α6 pathway, which
is transcriptionally activated by AR [29], further indirectly
supports a nongenomic mechanism.
Depending on the model being examined, the ability
of steroid receptors to activate nongenomic signaling may
or may not be ligand dependent. Our data demonstrating
that Casodex and RU486, ligand antagonists, block
invasion and Src activation support the conclusion that the
AR/Src invasion pathway is ligand dependent. Therefore,
we expected the cells expressing the AR ligand binding
mutant (LBD) to be neither invasive nor to activate Src.
Contrary to expectations, Src was constitutively activated
and the cells were highly invasive. However, the PC3ARLBD cells did not behave like any of the other cell lines
in that their invasive activity was not dependent on Src,
even though Src activity was elevated; nor did they
induce Matriptase activation. Our finding that addition of
cleaved and thus activated Matriptase, generated by AR/
Src signaling, exogenously to non-stimulated cells was
sufficient to increase invasion, indicates that the primary
target of AR/Src signaling in invasion is Matriptase. Thus
in the PC3AR-LBD cells, the failure to activate Matriptase
in spite of active Src, suggests it is Matriptase activation
that is sensitive to ligand binding. It further suggests that
depending on whether Src is activated through a liganddependent or -independent mechanism may determine
which downstream targets are affected and the biological
outcome.

Matriptase is required for AR-dependent
invasion
To assess whether Matriptase is required for
increased invasion induced by AR signaling, its expression
was suppressed by siRNA in PC3-AR cells and the effect
on Matrigel invasion evaluated. Inhibition of Matriptase
expression (Figure 6A) decreased invasion 3-fold
(Figure 6B). Conditioned medium from PC3-AR cells
containing cleaved Matriptase was sufficient to increase
the invasiveness of androgen-deprived C4–2 cells 3-fold
relative to untreated cells (Figure 6C). Conversely, depletion
of shed Matriptase from the PC3-AR cell conditioned
medium reduced C4–2 cell invasion 5-fold (Figure 6D).
Thus, shed Matriptase is required and sufficient to promote
Matrigel invasion of prostate tumor cells.

DISCUSSION
In addition to its role in regulating gene transcription
in the nucleus, AR like other steroid receptors rapidly
activates signal transduction pathways in the cytoplasm.
Pathways reported to be activated by nongenomic AR
signaling include MAPK, PI-3K, EGFR, and Src [16,
17, 43, 44]. Functionally, these pathways were linked
to AR-dependent increases in cell proliferation. In this
study, we demonstrate for the first time that AR stimulates
integrin-dependent prostate cancer invasion by stimulating
Src activity through a ligand-dependent but non-nuclear
mechanism. Src in turn stimulates rapid cell-associated
Matriptase cleavage and its extracellular shedding, which
is required for laminin matrix-dependent invasion.
We employed several different prostate cancer cell
lines to demonstrate the universality of the nongenomic
AR/Src invasion pathway. The first model made use
of PC3 cells engineered to express AR (PC3-AR). We
previously demonstrated that PC3-AR cells display
constitutive AR transcriptional activity as measured by
nuclear AR localization and elevated PSA and TMPRSS2
expression in the absence of androgen [29]. Cells were

Matriptase or indirectly through an associated molecule,
triggers an initial activation of the autocatalytic cleavage
of Matriptase between 20 minutes and 2 hours. The cellassociated Matriptase diminishes at the same time it

the course of 24 hours (Figure 4F). The cleavage and
release of Matriptase depletes cellular stores, triggering
an AR-dependent, but indirect, transcriptional increase in
Matriptase mRNA as reported previously [45].

To determine additional aspects of the mechanism by
which AR/Src signaling to Matriptase increases invasion,
we interrogated CDCP1, a known integrin regulator and
Src and Matriptase substrate [38–42]. While CDCP1
cleavage and phosphorylation was dependent on AR
and Src, it was not required for AR-dependent invasion.
Clinically, this is important because CDCP1 expression
is often elevated in primary cancers and prognostic
of poor outcome and survival [46]; however, recent
evidence indicates its expression actually decreases within
metastatic prostate cancer lesions (B. Knudsen, personal
communication). While, CDCP1 may be necessary in vivo
for initial metastatic dissemination [47], the dependence
on CDCP1 in late stage disease may decrease. It is also
possible that CDCP1 dependency is specific to a subset of
integrin/matrix interactions.
While enzalutamide can extend patient survival for
6 months, it is far from curative [48]. One mechanism
proposed for enzalutamide resistance is increased
Src activation [18]. Whether this is mediated through
cytoplasmic-localized AR, AR variants that arise during
enzalutamide resistance [49], or by some other mechanism
remains to be determined. Our data further indicate that
when Src is activated in resistant disease it could activate
Matriptase. In laminin-enriched tumor microenvironments,
such as that found in the bone and lymph nodes [50],
Matriptase activation may enhance metastatic spread and
could serve as an ideal therapeutic target in resistant disease.

lentiviruses as described previously [29]. PC3-AR TetON shRNA clones were generated by using pLKO-TetON vector (Novartis) that contained a single AR shRNA,
5′-CCGGCCTGCTAATCAAGTCACACATCTCGAGA
TGTGTGACTTGATTAGCAGGTTTTT-3′, purchased
from Open Biosystems and cloned upstream of the H1/
TO promoter as described [52, 53]. Src shRNAs, shSrc1:
5′-GACAGACCTGTCCTTCAAGAA-3′ and shSrc2:
5′-GCGGCTCCAGATTGTCAACAA-3′ in TRC pLKO
vector were purchased from Sigma. The AR Tet-ON
and Src shRNA plasmids were sequence validated and
packaged into lentiviruses using 293FT cells (Invitrogen).
PC3-AR cells were infected with Tet-ON-ARshRNA
or Src shRNA lentiviruses and individual clones were
selected using 1–3 μg/ml puromycin.

siRNA transfections
A pool of four small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
against androgen receptor (siGENOME SMARTpool),
integrin α6 (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool); integrin
α3 (ON-TATRGETplus SMARTpool); Src (ONTARGETplus SMARTpool); CDCP1 (ON-TATRGETplus
SMARTpool), or a non-targeting sequence were purchased
from Dharmacon. Matriptase-specific siRNA was
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Serumdeprived sub-confluent cells were transfected with siRNA
using siLentFect lipid reagent (Bio-Rad) and OptiMEM (Invitrogen) medium following manufacturer’s
directions. The medium was changed 16 hours after
siRNA transfection. All pools were titrated to determine
the lowest optimal concentration for inhibition of protein
expression by immunoblotting 72 hours after transfection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The prostate tumor cell lines PC3, LNCaP, and
VCaP, were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. C4–2 cells were obtained from Dr. Robert
Sikes, University of Delaware [51]. PC3 cells were grown
in F-12K media supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped
and charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (CSS), 2 mM
glutamine, 50 U penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin.
LNCaP, VCaP, and C4–2 cells were grown in RPMI
1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 U penicillin, 50 μg/
ml streptomycin, 0.225% glucose, 10 mM HEPES, and
1 mM sodium pyruvate. For experiments, LNCaP, VCaP,
and C4–2 cells were seeded on laminin (Millipore) and
grown in phenol-red free media and 0.1% CSS for 24
hours before and throughout the experiment. All cells were
grown at 37°C in 5% CO2.

Drug treatments
Mifrepristone (RU486) was purchased from Tocris
Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). Dasatinib was a gift from Dr.
Matt Steensma (Van Andel Research Institute). Bicalutamide
(Casodex) was purchased from Enzo Life Science
(Farmingdale, NY). Each drug was diluted into ethanol and
used at a final concentration of 10 nM. Metribolone (R1881)
was purchased from PerkinElmer (Boston, MA). R1881 was
diluted into ethanol and then into phenol red free media and
used at a final concentration of 10 nM in all experiments.
Actinomycin D was purchased from Calbiochem and
reconstituted in DMSO at a concentration of 10 μg/mL.
For R1881 treatments, cells were starved 24 hours in
0.1% charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) prior to stimulation.
Inhibitors were added during the starvation period and
maintained during androgen stimulation.

DNA constructs and cell lines

Immunoblotting

Stable clonal isolates of PC3 cells expressing empty
vectors, PC3-Puro and pLKO.1, or wild type or mutant
AR, PC3-AR, PC3-ΔNLS, and PC3-ΔLBD (N705S),
were generated by infecting cells with retroviruses or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Total whole cell lysates were prepared for
immunoblotting as previously described [30, 54]. Briefly,
cells were lysed on ice with MAPK lysis buffer (50 mM

Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 100 mM NaCl,
50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
1% Triton-X100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml
leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM
benzamide) or RIPA (10 mM Tris pH 7.2, 158 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% NaDOC, 1% Triton-X100,
1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 100U/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml
pepstatin and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). For immunoblotting,
40–65 μg of total cell lysates in 2X SDS sample buffer
were boiled for 5 minutes and run on SDS polyacrylamide
gels following standard SDS-PAGE protocols, then
transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were
blocked in 5% BSA in TBST for two hours at room
temperature, and then were probed with primary antibody
for two hours at room temperature. Signal was detected,
after incubation with horseradish peroxide-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) in 5% BSA in TBST for
1 hour at room temperature, by chemiluminescence with
a CCD camera in a Bio-Rad Chemi-Doc Imaging System
using Quantity One software v4.5.2 (Bio-Rad).
Primary antibodies were as follows: anti-AR mono­
clonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Bcl-xL
polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies); antiMatriptase polyclonal antibody (Bethyl Laboratories); antiphospho-[Y416]-Src polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen); anti-Src
monoclonal antibody (Src 327) [55]; anti-CDCP1 polyclonal
antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies); and anti-Tubulin
monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).

Hoechst 33258 for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells
were washed four times with TBS + 0.1% TritonX-100
over ten minutes between all steps. Epifluorescent images
were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 fluorescence
microscope using OpenLab v5.5.0 image analysis software
(Improvision).

Migration assays
Cell migration was measured using the modified
Boyden chamber assay. Cells (5 x 104) were suspended
in the upper well of the 8.0 μm pore size polyethylene
terephthalate membrane culture inserts for (BD
Biosciences) in which the bottom membrane was precoated with 1 μM laminin. The lower and upper chambers
were filled with 400 μL phenol-red and serum-free
DMEM. After 6 hours of incubation, the culture inserts
were removed and washed with 1X PBS. Cells that had
migrated to the lower membrane surface were stained with
Crystal Violet (Millipore) and counted under a microscope
in five random fields per insert in triplicate.

Matrigel invasion assays
Serum-starved sub-confluent cells (6.25 × 104)
were suspended in the upper well of the 8.0 μm pore size
Matrigel membrane culture inserts (BD Biosciences) in
which the bottom membrane was pre-coated with 1 μM
laminin. The upper and lower chambers were filled with
400 μL phenol-red and serum-free DMEM. After 72 hour
incubation, the culture inserts were removed and washed
once with 1X PBS. Cells that invaded through Matrigel
to the lower membrane surface were stained with Crystal
Violet (Millipore) and counted under a microscope in five
random fields per insert in triplicate.

Immunoprecipitation
For detection of phosphorylated CDCP1 and
phospho-[Y416]-Src, cell lysates were prepared as
described above. Protein samples (500 μg), in a volume of
500 μL of 1X MAPK buffer, were incubated with 1 μg of
mouse monoclonal anti-Src antibody [55] or anti-CDCP1
(Cell Signaling Technologies) overnight at 4°C. Proteinantibody complex was precipitated with protein G or
protein A beads (Thermo Scientific) respectively followed
by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-phospho-[Y416]-Src
antibody (Invitrogen) or mouse 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Millipore) as described above.

Isolation of conditioned medium
To examine Matriptase shedding into the medium,
cells were washed 2 times with PBS and placed in serumfree medium for 24 hours prior to R1881 stimulation.
10–15 mL of medium was collected on ice from the plates
and loaded into Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units
(Millipore). The Amicon filter tubes were centrifuged at
4000 × g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Concentrated medium was
collected and subjected to SDS PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membrane for immunoblotting. Protein loading was
normalized to total cell number.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS at 4°C for twenty minutes and permeabilized for
ten minutes with TBS (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl) + 0.5% TritonX-100 at room temperature. Cells
were then blocked with 2% BSA in TBS + 0.1% Triton
X-100 for twenty minutes at room temperature before
incubation with vinculin antibody (Sigma) and Alexafluor
546-Phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for one
hour. Cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa
Flour-488 secondary antibody for one hour at room
temperature. DNA was visualized by staining with
