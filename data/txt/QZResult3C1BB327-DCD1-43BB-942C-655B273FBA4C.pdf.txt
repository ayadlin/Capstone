Abstract
Celecoxib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in
human tumors, but the molecular mechanisms for these
processes are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated
the ability of celecoxib to induce toxicity in head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and explored the relationships between celecoxib-induced cell cycle inhibition and
toxicity in HNSCC. Celecoxib inhibited the proliferation of
UM-SCC-1 and UM-SCC-17B cells both in vitro and in vivo,
accompanied by G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Celecoxib induced p21waf1/cip1 at the transcriptional level
independent of wild-type p53 function, leading to decreased
expression of cyclin D1 and hypophosphorylation of Rb, with
subsequent marked downstream decreases in nuclear E2F-1
protein expression and E2F transactivating activity by
luciferase reporter assay. Cell cycle phase–specific cytometric
sorting showed that celecoxib induced clonogenic toxicity
preferentially to cells within the S phase greater than G1 and
G2 phases. Levels of p21waf1/cip1 and cyclin D1 protein were
reduced in the S phase compared with the G1 and G2 phases,
suggesting a possible protective role for p21waf1/cip1 expression
in celecoxib toxicity. In conclusion, we show that celecoxib has
marked antiproliferative activity against head and neck
cancer cells through transcriptional induction of p21waf1/cip1
and G1 phase accumulation leading to S phase–specific
clonogenic toxicity. We additionally show that a profound
inhibition of nuclear E2F function provides a possible
mechanism for this S phase–specific toxicity. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Over 27,000 new cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head
and neck (HNSCC) will be diagnosed in the United States this year,
and surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy remain the
hallmarks of modern HNSCC treatment (1). Despite dramatic
improvements in surgical technique, radiation delivery, and
chemotherapy regimens, overall survival rates for this disease have
remained nearly constant for the last 40 years. Any therapeutic
modalities that would increase curative outcomes without
additional toxicity would be of great benefit.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition has emerged as a novel
molecular target for the prevention and treatment of head and
neck cancers with this goal in mind (2). COX-2 is the key inducible
enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins
(3) and seems to be elevated in a number of human cancers (4–8),

including HNSCC (9). Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, is
currently Food and Drug Administration–approved for chemoprevention in familial adenomatous polyposis based on demonstrable inhibition of colon polyp formation, further solidifying the
use of this agent in cancer therapy (10). Recent large-cohort clinical
trials have shown the significant activity that celecoxib has in vivo
against colorectal adenomas (11). These same studies have also
shown a risk of cardiac toxicity with long-term administration
of celecoxib at high doses, and authors of these studies suggest
that the significant antineoplastic benefits of celecoxib need to be
balanced against these toxicities in human cancer treatment
protocols (12, 13). It seems likely that long-term use of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) for chemoprevention may not be
possible due to these toxicity issues, but short-term combination
therapies with standard agents may significantly augment standard
cancer treatments. A clearer understanding of the mechanism of
the toxicity of celecoxib will allow for improved clinical outcomes
while limiting treatment morbidity.
NSAIDs have been shown to markedly alter cell cycle kinetics in
a number of human tumors, and cell cycle alteration seems to be a
major contributing factor in celecoxib-mediated cancer toxicity.
Celecoxib usually inhibits cell cycle progression through the G1
phase, and this inhibition of proliferation seems to be independent
of COX-2 enzyme inhibition in breast cancer models (14). Ovarian
tumors are similarly blocked in G1 following treatment with NS-398
(a COX-2–specific inhibitor), and this effect also seems to be
independent of COX-2 inhibition (15). This implies that the actual
mechanism underlying the antiproliferative activity of NSAIDs may
be independent of COX-2 inhibition. The cellular factors involved
in this cell cycle inhibition and how these changes affect the
subsequent toxicity of celecoxib and other NSAIDs are not clearly
known. Celecoxib alters the levels of several important G1 cell cycle
checkpoint proteins including p21waf1/cip1 (p21) and cyclin D1,
and this may mediate the activity of this drug (14, 16). NSAIDs have
additionally been shown to induce peroxisome proliferator–
activated receptor (PPAR) transcription factor family members
(17), and PPAR-g antisense oligonucleotides have been shown to
abrogate the antiproliferative effects of NSAID compounds. These
data propose a possible mechanism for the antineoplastic activity
of NSAIDs apart from COX-2 inhibition through cell cycle
inhibition by a transcriptional activation system. Unfortunately,
few studies have confirmed these mechanistic patterns in HNSCC,
and the connections between these pathways in any cell system
remain unclear at best.
In this paper, we show that celecoxib has strong antiproliferative
and toxic activity against HNSCC cells, shown by decreased in vitro
and in vivo cellular growth, G1 cell cycle phase accumulation, and
apoptosis. We show that celecoxib induces expression of both
PPAR-g and p21 protein independent of wild-type p53 activity,
and that the induction of p21 occurs at the transcriptional level.
We further show that these G1 checkpoint protein alterations lead
to a marked decrease in E2F activity and subsequent cell cycle

phase–specific toxicity in the S phase, correlating with p21
expression changes across the cell cycle phases. To date, no one
has shown cell cycle phase–specific toxicity of any NSAID agent,
and this describes a connection between the cytostatic and toxic
effects of celecoxib treatment. This cell cycle phase–specific
toxicity also points toward a potential avenue for therapeutic
synergism by combining celecoxib with treatment modalities that
are active in the S and G2 phases, including radiation therapy and
chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents. All drugs and biochemicals were supplied by SigmaAldrich Fine Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise specified.
Celecoxib was purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN). Celecoxib
was prepared as a 0.1 mol/L stock solution in DMSO. Tissue culture
reagents were supplied by Invitrogen Corporation/Life Technologies Life
Sciences (Carlsbad, CA). The UM-SCC-1 and UM-SCC-17B oral cancer cell
lines were generously provided by Dr. Thomas Carey (University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). All cell lines were maintained as monolayer
cultures in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%
penicillin-streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% non–essential amino acids.
Proliferation assays. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were done according to standard published
protocols (18). Cells were incubated with drug and harvested after 96 h of
drug exposure, followed by exposure to the MTT reagent (500 Ag/mL) and
data analysis. Relative MTT absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a Syva
Autotrak EIA Autoreader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Growth
curve assays were done according to standard parameters. For xenograft
assays, 6- to 8-week-old athymic nu/nu female mice (National Cancer
Institute, Bethesda, MD) received bilateral flank injections of 1  106
HNSCC cells. For growth analysis, mice were immediately started on dietary
celecoxib chow (1,500 ppm in irradiated NIH 31 chow, Harlan Teklad,
Madison, WI) or control chow (NIH 31, Harlan Teklad). For gavage
experiments, mice received daily oral gavage with a solution of 1,500 mg/kg/
day celecoxib in 0.5% methylcellulose or control methylcellulose gavage for
14 days. Tumor volume was calculated using the following equation:
tumor volume = p/6  (large diameter)  (small diameter)2. All animal
experiments were done according to University of Iowa Animal Care Facility
protocols.
Flow cytometry assays. For cell cycle phase–sorting experiments, cells
were incubated with 5 Amol/L Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)
for 1 h at 37jC and filtered through 70-Am mesh. Cells were sorted on a
Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA) FACS DiVa using 100 mW at 488 nm
from a Coherent I90C-4 argon ion laser for generation of forward- and sidescatter signals and 100 mW of multi-line UV from a Coherent 302C krypton
laser for Hoechst excitation. Hoechst emissions were detected after passing
through a 510SP dichroic filter and 424/44 band-pass filter. Amorphous
gates were used in bivariate plots of forward-scatter area (FSC-A) versus
side-scatter area (SSC-A), forward-scatter area (FSC-A) versus forwardscatter width (FSC-W), and Hoechst area versus Hoechst width to eliminate
dead cells, debris, and aggregates. Following sorting, cells were plated
at clonogenic density (500–2,500 cells) into 60-mm tissue culture plates in
the absence of drug and allowed to grow for 2 weeks. Additional cells
were prepared for SDS-PAGE immunoblotting as described below. Cells
were fixed with 70% ethanol for 2 min and then stained with crystal violet
(0.5% in H2O). Colonies containing more than 50 cells were scored, and
survival fractions were calculated. Active caspase-3 assays were done
according to manufacturer’s instructions (PE-Conjugated Monoclonal
Active Caspase-3 Antibody Apoptosis Kit; BD PharMingen, San Diego,
CA). Propidium iodide (PI)–staining for sub-G1 DNA accumulation was
done according to published protocols (19). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
pulse flow cytometric assays for cell cycle progression were done according
to previously published guidelines (20).
Immunoblotting. Protein lysates were generated in reducing lysis buffer
and boiled for 7 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to standard

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

parameters. Protein content was measured by Bradford assay. A total of
20 Ag of protein was loaded on 12% agarose gels (except 7.5% for Rb gels)
according to standard SDS-PAGE protocol. Proteins were transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h according to standard protocol. Equal
protein loading was confirmed via Ponceau S staining of nitrocellulose.
Blots were probed for 1 h with primary antibody diluted in 5% nonfat dry
milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), followed by 3  10min washes. Primary antibodies included COX-1 (1:200 dilution, Cayman
Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI), COX-2 (1:250, Cayman Chemical
Company), p21waf1/cip1 (1:250, BD PharMingen), p53 (1:500, BD PharMingen),
Rb (1:250, BD PharMingen), cyclin D1 (1:333, BD PharMingen), E2F-1 (1:250,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), PPAR-g (1:250, sc-7273, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) actin (1:2,000, Sigma) and a-tubulin (1:4,000, Oncogene
Research Products, San Diego, CA). Blots were then probed with
appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000–10,000,
Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in 5% nonfat dry
milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed 5  8 min in
TBS-T and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England) followed by radiographic exposure
and development. Relative band intensities were determined using CCD
camera-based densitometry of bands (Alpha Imager 2200, Alpha Innotech
Corporation, San Leandro, CA). Band intensities were first normalized to
a-tubulin in each sample, and results were calculated relative to untreated
controls.
Quantitative analysis of p21waf1/cip1 mRNA levels by real-time
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. PCR assays used TaqMan
Universal RT-PCR Master Mix (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA),
and reactions were done and analyzed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence
detector equipped with a 96-well thermal cycler (PE Applied Biosystems).
RNA was isolated by TRIzol and chloroform extraction (Invitrogen
Corporation). About 100 ng of RNA was loaded per PCR reaction. RNA
was reverse transcribed (30 min at 48jC, denaturation at 95jC for 10 min),
followed by 40 cycles of PCR (92jC for 30 s and 60jC for 30 s). Fluorogenic
probes were labeled at 5¶ and 3¶ ends with a reporter [6-carboxy-fluorescein
(FAM)] and a quencher dye [6-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)].
Primers for PCR amplification of p21 were 5¶-CTGGAGACTCTCAGGGTCGAA-3¶ ( forward), 5¶-GGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATCT-3¶(reverse), and 5¶FAM-ACGGCGGCAGACCAGCATGA-TAMRA-3¶ (probe; ref. 21). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probes and primers were
purchased from Applied Biosystems.
p21 mRNA turnover assay. UM-SCC-1 cells were plated to 50%
confluence in 60-mm3 tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h.
Cells were incubated with celecoxib (100 Amol/L) or DMSO control (0.1%)
for 14 h. Actinomycin D was prepared as a 1-mg/mL solution in sterile
water, and added to culture plates at 1 Ag/mL concentration. RNA was
harvested over 12 h using TRIzol and chloroform extraction technique
(Invitrogen Corporation). p21 RNA levels were then evaluated using realtime quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) techniques
as described above.
E2F promoter luciferase reporter assays. Dr. Mark May (University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) graciously provided the 3 E2F luciferase
reporter construct. pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid was
purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). UM-SCC-1 cells were cultured in
24-well plates and pretreated with a range of celecoxib doses for 6 h. A 4:1
ratio of E2F reporter plasmid to pRL-TK vector was transfected into UMSCC-1 cells using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. E2F promoter activity was
assayed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter kit from Promega according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase reactions were done on
Luminoskan Ascent Luminometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Helsinki,
Finland). Luciferase activity was reported as a ratio of E2F activity relative
to untreated control UM-SCC-1 cells in triplicate experiments.
Data analysis. All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate, and
representative data from a single experiment are presented in this
manuscript as means, SD, and SE. Statistical comparisons between
experimental groups included the use of a two-tailed Student’s t test and
ANOVA. Data points marked with an asterisk indicate P < 0.05.

Celecoxib Toxicity Is Cell Cycle Phase Specific

Results
Celecoxib inhibits HNSCC viability. UM-SCC-1 and UMSCC-17B cells were treated with a dose range of celecoxib (0–100
Amol/L) for 96 h and assayed for viability using a standard MTT
assay (Fig. 1A). Celecoxib induced a strong dose-dependent
decrease in MTT absorbance in UM-SCC-1 and UM-SCC-17B cells,
with an IC50 of 39.9 F 1.1 and 35.2 F 2.3 Amol/L, respectively
(averaged from triplicate experiments). We also evaluated the
ability of celecoxib to inhibit HNSCC proliferation by standard
growth curve assays (Fig. 1B). UM-SCC-1 cells were incubated with
a range of doses of celecoxib, and samples were harvested 3, 5, and
7 days after drug addition. Celecoxib administration produced a
dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation across a wide
dose range. These data show that celecoxib treatment produces
strong in vitro inhibition of HNSCC viability and proliferation.
In vivo celecoxib antiproliferative activity was assayed using a
mouse xenograft assay (Fig. 1C). Bilateral UM-SCC-1 xenograft
tumors were grown on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice, and
treatment mice consumed celecoxib chow (1,500 ppm). Celecoxib
administration began on the day of tumor injection, and all mice
were allowed continuous access to either drug or control chow
throughout the experimental period. Celecoxib strongly inhibited
in vivo tumor xenograft growth, inducing nearly a 5-fold decrease
in overall tumor size (82%). This decrease in tumor size was
statistically significant after 14 days of treatment and remained
throughout the duration of the experimental period.
Celecoxib induces apoptosis in HNSCC. The antiproliferative
effect of celecoxib can occur through the induction of apoptosis
or cell cycle arrest. Therefore, we assessed the ability of celecoxib
to induce apoptosis in our HNSCC model by evaluating the
levels of active caspase-3, a central and irreversible component of
both the cytosolic and mitochondrial apoptosis cascades,
following treatment with celecoxib. UM-SCC-1 cells were treated
for 36 h with a dose range of celecoxib, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and incubated with a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated
antibody against active caspase-3. Dose-dependent increases in
active caspase-3 levels were seen between 100 and 200 Amol/L
celecoxib (Fig. 2A). We also assayed for apoptosis by analyzing
sub-G1 DNA formation. Cells were treated with a similar dose
range of celecoxib, and dose-dependent accumulation of sub-G1
DNA was observed again between doses of 100 and 200 Amol/L
celecoxib (Fig. 2B).
Celecoxib inhibits progression through the G1-S transition
via induction of p21. The effects of celecoxib on cell cycle
progression in HNSCC were determined using BrdUrd pulse-chase
experiments, allowing for clear visualization of G1, S, and G2
populations as previously described (20). UM-SCC-1 cells were
treated with 0 to 100 Amol/L celecoxib for 24 h before ethanol
fixation and staining. Celecoxib treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell cycle progression through the G1-S
transition, leading to >77% G1 phase accumulation after 24 h of
treatment with 100 Amol/L celecoxib [Fig. 3A (histograms) and
B (graphic data)]. A concomitant decrease in both S phase and G2
phase distributions was noted as G1 populations increased.
Further studies were done to evaluate the specific cellular
proteins involved in these observed G1 phase cell cycle rearrangements. Celecoxib administration induced COX-2 expression at high
doses, but COX-1 levels did not change appreciably following
celecoxib administration. This increase in COX-2 expression was
not associated with increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels by

enzyme-linked PGE2 immunoassay (data not shown). Celecoxib
induced p21 in a dose-dependent fashion, increasing to more than
16-fold of baseline expression by 50 Amol/L (Fig. 3C). This increase
in p21 protein expression levels was seen within 6 h of initiation of
treatment (data not shown). UM-SCC-1 cells have previously been
reported to have wild-type p53 activity (22). Wild-type p53 levels
were expressed at very low levels and did not change appreciably
following celecoxib treatment. Induction of p21 was accompanied
by a decrease in cyclin D1 expression and a dose-dependent
increase in the predominance of hypophosphorylated Rb, consistent with the previously observed G1 phase accumulation (Fig. 3A).
PPAR-g may also be involved in the activity of NSAIDs (23, 24), and

we therefore evaluated the expression of this transcription factor
following celecoxib treatment. PPAR-g protein levels increased in a
dose-dependent fashion by more than 40-fold at the highest
doses of celecoxib and were increased by even low doses of
celecoxib (1–5 Amol/L). These data show that celecoxib strongly
induces p21 and PPAR-g without significant changes in p53
expression, leading to decreased cyclin D1 expression and a shift to
the hypophosphorylated state of Rb.
We also evaluated the effects of celecoxib therapy on G1
checkpoint protein expression in a head and neck tumor xenograft
model (Fig. 3D). Four athymic nude mice were injected with
bilateral xenograft tumors of UM-SCC-17B cells, and tumors were

Celecoxib Toxicity Is Cell Cycle Phase Specific

Figure 4. Celecoxib induces transcriptional activation of p21. UM-SCC-1 cells
were treated with 100 Amol/L celecoxib for 14 h, and actinomycin D was added
to all plates to arrest transcription. RNA was extracted at 4, 8, and 12 h, and
relative p21 mRNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR.

allowed to grow for 1 week to an average volume of f100 mm3.
Mice were then gavaged with 1,500 mg/kg/day of celecoxib or
control methylcellulose solution for 14 days. Tumors were
dissected, and protein was extracted, followed by Western blot
analysis of G1 checkpoint protein expression, as well as PPAR-g. As
seen in the previous in vitro studies, p21 and PPAR-g were induced
in the tumor xenografts compared with controls (1.5- and 1.25-fold,
respectively), with a corresponding 4-fold decrease in cyclin D1
expression. UM-SCC-17B cells also express wild-type p53 (25), and
again, p53 levels did not seem to change significantly following
celecoxib gavage. This implies that p21 induction was also
independent of p53 function in this in vivo head and neck
xenograft model. Overall, this pattern of in vivo G1 checkpoint
protein expression recapitulates the previous in vitro data and
suggests that p21 induction leads to downstream inhibition of
cyclin D1 and subsequent hypophosphorylation of Rb.
Celecoxib induces p21 expression by transcriptional activation. Celecoxib strongly induced p21 expression in our model
system of HNSCC, and this seemed to be independent of wild-type
p53 activity. To determine the mechanism of this increase in p21
protein levels, we evaluated the expression of p21 mRNA following
celecoxib administration using quantitative real-time RT-PCR
analysis. Subconfluent UM-SCC-1 cells were treated with 100
Amol/L celecoxib or 0.1% DMSO for 14 h. After drug exposure,
actinomycin D (1 Ag/mL) was added to the culture media to inhibit
de novo RNA transcription, and samples were collected over the
following 12 h (Fig. 4). RNA levels were standardized relative to
DMSO 0.1% 0-h control point. Celecoxib treatment induced a
5.3-fold increase in p21 mRNA expression after 14 h of treatment.
After addition of actinomycin D, both control and celecoxib
treatments showed a marked decrease in p21 mRNA over the
following 12 h, with a plateau phase between 4 and 8 h. Final levels
of p21 mRNA 12 h after addition of actinomycin D were f10% of
0-h levels for both groups. The overall rate of decay for both groups

www.aacrjournals.org

was nearly identical, indicating that the mechanism for the
observed increase in p21 mRNA levels was due to transcriptional
induction and not to decreased RNA degradation.
Celecoxib treatment induces profound inhibition of E2F
activity. We showed above that p21 induction induced a
predominance of the hypophosphorylated form of Rb following
celecoxib treatment. In this state, E2F should be highly bound to
Rb in the cytoplasm of the cell, thereby inactivating E2F activity.
We therefore evaluated the transcriptional transactivating activity
of the E2F promoter using a luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 5A).
UM-SCC-1 cells were pretreated with celecoxib for 6 h before
transfection of a synthetic 3 E2F-driven luciferase reporter
plasmid and then incubated with the reporter construct overnight
along with the drug. Celecoxib treatment produced a dosedependent decrease in E2F transactivating activity that roughly
paralleled the amount of hypophosphorylated Rb present on
Western blots (Fig. 3C). At maximal dosing of 100 Amol/L
celecoxib, E2F activity decreased by more than 50-fold compared
with DMSO-treated controls.
We further evaluated the nuclear expression of E2F-1 following
treatment with celecoxib. UM-SCC-1 and UM-SCC-17B cells were
treated with 0.1% DMSO or 100 Amol/L celecoxib for 24 h, followed
by nuclear protein extraction and Western blotting for E2F-1
(Fig. 5B, inset). Baseline levels of nuclear E2F-1 expression were
similar for both cell lines. Celecoxib produced a significant
decrease (4–5-fold) in the amount of E2F-1 protein in the nucleus
in both cell lines. Thus, celecoxib treatment reduced overall levels
of E2F-1 protein within the nucleus and produced a profound
decrease in E2F transactivating activity.

Figure 5. Celecoxib inhibits E2F expression and activity. UM-SCC-1 cells were
pretreated with indicated dose range of celecoxib for 6 h, followed by transfection
with a 4:1 ratio of a 3 E2F promoter firefly luciferase reporter vector and
control Renilla luciferase vector. Celecoxib was added to the media for an
additional 14 h following luciferase construct transfections. Relative luciferase
activity was determined by dual luciferase reporter assay. A, relative E2F

Celecoxib specifically kills S phase cells, which correlates
with phase-specific alterations in p21 induction. Celecoxib
induced apoptosis at doses where we also observed strong
inhibition of E2F function and cell cycle rearrangement. To further
evaluate the effect of these observed cell cycle rearrangements on
celecoxib-induced cytotoxicity, we treated UM-SCC-1 cells with
0.1% DMSO and 50 or 100 Amol/L celecoxib for 24 h and then did
vital cellular staining with 5 Amol/L Hoechst 33342, followed by cell
cycle phase–specific cytometric sorting. This technique allowed for
identification and collection of pure cell populations from the G1, S,
and G2 phases (see Fig. 6D for representative sorting histograms).
Cells from each phase were then plated at clonogenic density in the
absence of drug and evaluated for growth potential by standard
clonogenic survival assay techniques. Figure 6A shows representative clonogenic survival plates seeded at similar density and
treated for 24 h with 100 Amol/L celecoxib before sorting and
plating, whereas Fig. 6B shows overall experimental data presented
in graphic form for celecoxib 50 and 100 Amol/L dosing compared
with control plating efficiency. Treatment with 50 Amol/L celecoxib

for 24 h before sorting did not cause significant changes in plating
efficiency across all cell cycle phases, although a general trend was
noted toward decreased plating efficiency in the S phase at this
dose (Fig. 6B). In contrast, 24-h treatment with 100 Amol/L
celecoxib produced significant changes in plating efficiency across
all cell cycle phases, with the most profound toxicity in the S phase
(Fig. 6A and B). G1 phase clonogenic survival was 43.2 F 12.3% of
control survival efficiency, a statistically significant decrease. G2
phase cells had even lower plating efficiency, with 24.1 F 2.0% of
control efficiency. In contrast, cells from the S phase had a plating
efficiency of only 3.64 F 2.6% of control, more than a 27-fold
decrease in plating efficiency compared with control.
We further hypothesized that changes in p21 expression may
affect this celecoxib-induced phase-specific toxicity due to effects
of p21 expression on cell cycle transition out of the G1 phase. Using
standard SDS-PAGE techniques on protein extracts from pure
sorted cell cycle populations, we observed faint expression of p21
in the G1 and G2 phase of control cells (0.1% DMSO treated,
Fig. 6C). Strong induction of p21 was seen in the G1 and G2 phase

Figure 6. Celecoxib induces specific clonogenic toxicity within the S and G2 phases. UM-SCC-1 cells were treated with DMSO control (0.1%) or celecoxib (50 and
100 Amol/L) for 24 h, followed by 30 min of incubation with Hoechst 33342. Cells were trypsinized and sorted by FACS DiVa for cell cycle distribution, allowing for
identification and collection of pure G1, S, and G2 populations. These cells were plated at clonogenic density and allowed to incubate at 37jC for 2 wks, followed
by ethanol fixation, crystal violet staining, and colony counting. Colonies with a minimum of 50 cells were counted, and all experiments were done in triplicate.

Celecoxib Toxicity Is Cell Cycle Phase Specific

populations after 24 h of treatment with 50 and 100 Amol/L
celecoxib, 6- and 8.5-fold, respectively, compared with controls.
Expression of p21 in the S phase was barely detectable at both
doses. Further blotting for cyclin D1 showed a general trend toward
decreased cyclin D1 expression as doses of celecoxib decreased,
especially within the S phase. These data show that p21 and cyclin
D1 are relatively underexpressed in the S phase of celecoxib-treated
cells and suggest that p21 and cyclin D1 expression may perhaps be
protective against celecoxib-induced toxicity in the G1 and G2 cell
cycle phases.

Discussion
We show for the first time in this study that celecoxib toxicity is
targeted specifically to the S phase of the cell cycle. This is of
considerable significance because celecoxib is currently being used
in clinical trials with agents most active in the S and G2 phases,
such as chemotherapeutic agents (docetaxel, ref. 26; cisplatin/5fluorouracil, ref. 27) and radiation (28, 29). This demonstration of
marked toxicity specifically limited to cells within the S phase
following celecoxib administration provides a clear basis for
additive or synergistic toxicity with agents that function specifically
in the S and G2 phases. We also show that this specific toxicity is
likely mediated at least in part through profound downstream
inhibition of E2F-1 activity within the nucleus because celecoxib
induces derangements of G1 checkpoint proteins and downstream
sequestration of E2F by hypophosphorylated Rb. Without active
nuclear E2F-1 function, crucial S phase activities such as DNA
repair are impaired, leading to eventual cell death (30). Indeed,
celecoxib has been previously shown to inhibit DNA repair
enzymes such as Ku70 through the inhibition of nuclear factor
nB, leading to radiosensitization (31). Of note, decreased expression
of Ku70 is seen at doses of celecoxib where we routinely observe
strong E2F inhibition, suggesting that this E2F inhibition may be
involved in downstream inhibition of intracellular DNA repair
activity. Further work is needed to clarify these connections
between toxicity and E2F activity and how these relate to the
observed G1 arrest following celecoxib treatment.
The mechanism for celecoxib-induced specific S phase toxicity
may also be related to the relative inability of S phase cells to
manage reactive oxygen stress. NSAID compounds are able to
markedly increase the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS; ref. 32). Celecoxib has previously been shown to
increase the formation of ROS in osteosarcoma cells (33). G1 and G2
populations are able to perform silent repair of oxidative DNA
lesions through the base excision repair pathway, whereas the S
phase remains highly sensitive to perturbations of peroxide and
other ROS (34). It is possible that the generation of ROS by
celecoxib leads to pronounced toxicity to S phase cells through
reactive oxygen toxicity and DNA damage, while leaving G1 and G2
phases relatively protected. Additional studies are needed to clarify

the exact relationship between the E2F inhibition that we observe
and S phase progression following celecoxib treatment and how
this may specifically relate to DNA replication and repair.
We also show for the first time that levels of p21 and cyclin
D1 change markedly across the cell cycle phases following
treatment with celecoxib, correlating with observed levels of
toxicity. In sorted cell cycle populations, p21 was strongly
induced in the G1 phase and, to a lesser extent, the G2 phase,
and this expression roughly correlates with clonogenic survival
within these cell cycle phases. Cells that are overexpressing p21
will arrest in the G1 phase and are then inhibited from further
cell cycle progression. We routinely observe significant G1 phase
accumulation only at doses of celecoxib sufficient to induce p21
and inhibit E2F function, suggesting that p21 function is
important in this G1 blockade. Our data show that it is transit
through S phase that is most toxic to celecoxib-treated cells;
therefore, p21 induction would offer a protective effect by
prohibiting cells from progressing into S phase. One previous
study has also shown a similar protective effect of p21 expression
in NSAID toxicity. Jung et al. (35) showed that murine
thymocytes deficient in p21 were more susceptible to apoptosis
following sulindac administration, another NSAID compound.
This protective component of p21 expression has also been
observed in chemotherapeutic toxicity studies, where cells
expressing p21 are inhibited from progressing through S phase
and developing polyploidy (36). Conversely, it is also likely that
overexpression of p21 is at least partly responsible for the
inhibition of E2F function that we observe, which may contribute
to S phase toxicity (31). In this way, p21 induction may have a
dual role in celecoxib toxicity, protecting cells from toxicity by
inducing G1 arrest, but inhibiting S phase E2F activity and
thereby causing toxicity to cells progressing through S phase.
In conclusion, we show that celecoxib treatment produces
marked toxicity in HNSCC cells through transcriptional induction
of p21 and E2F-1 inhibition. This toxicity is specifically targeted to
S phase cells, leading to a direct mechanism for synergistic toxicity
with many common anticancer agents such as chemotherapeutics
and radiation. This provides a rationale for the continued use of
celecoxib in clinical cancer trials and dictates a basis for developing
further combination therapies that exploit this facet of celecoxibinduced toxicity.
