BACKGROUND. A phase 2 trial of gemcitabine and capecitabine (GemCap) in
patients with advanced biliary cancer led to an objective response in approximately 30% of patients and a median survival of 14 months. In the current study,
the authors report further efficacy data of a larger cohort of such patients treated
with the GemCap regimen.

METHODS. Patients aged >18 years and who had a diagnosis of locally advanced
biliary cancer received first-line treatment with capecitabine at a dose of 650
mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days and gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Day

RESULTS. Between July 2001 and January 2005, 75 patients were enrolled in the
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 19.4–41%), with a median duration of 9.7
months (range, 3–36 months). Three patients achieved complete responses, with
a median duration of 17 months (range, 9–27 months). The median progressionfree survival and overall survivals were 6.2 months (95% CI, 4.4–8.3 months) and
12.7 months (95% CI, 9.5–31 months), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. The GemCap regimen is active in patients with biliary cancer.

iliary cancers are among the most lethal gastrointestinal cancers,1 and their incidence is rising.2 The prognosis of biliary
cancers (adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) is dismal, with <5% of patients alive
at 5 years after first diagnosis.1 The median survival of patients with
metastatic biliary tumors is usually <1 year, and the majority of
these patients die as a consequence of cholangitis, hepatic failure,
or cancer-related general consumption. To our knowledge, complete
surgical ressection is the only curative modality and, to date, there
is no definite evidence that chemotherapy adds to survival or quality of life compared with best supportive care.
In the past, biliary cancer was considered a chemoresistant disease because 5-fluorouracil-based regimens led to tumor responses
in <10% of patients.3,4 However, in the last 10 years, several phase 2
trials with new chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated tumor
response in 20% to 35% of patients treated with single agents (gemcitabine5,6 or capecitabine7), and in 20% to 45% of patients treated
with chemotherapy combinations.8–14 Among these studies, Knox

et al.14 reported that the combination of gemcitabine
and capecitabine (GemCap) in 45 patients with
locally advanced or metastatic biliary tumors led to
objective responses in 30% of patients with cholangiocarcinoma and in 23% of patients with tumors
arising from the gallbladder, with a median survival
of 14 months.14 After the publication of this study,
and while developing the next clinical trial, the GemCap regimen phase 2 trial was expanded to 75
patients with advanced biliary cancers, all of whom
were treated as per protocol at the Princess Margaret
Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
The objective of the current study was to report
further data concerning efficacy in an expanded
cohort of patients treated with the GemCap regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study
The current study was an expanded nonrandomized,
single-institution phase 2 clinical trial of gemcitabine
combined with capecitabine for patients with advanced
biliary tumors. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an objective response; secondary
endpoints included the median progression-free survival and overall survival of the entire cohort and by
type of cancer.
Patients
Patients aged >18 years with pathologically confirmed, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic
adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic
biliary ducts or gallbladder were considered eligible.
Patients had to have measurable disease. Additional
inclusion criteria were no prior systemic antineoplastic therapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 2, and adequate organ
function (neutrophil count 1.5 3 10/L, platelet
count 100 3 10/L, serum creatinine 160 lmol/L
or actual or calculated creatinine clearance 60 mL/
min, alanine aminotransferase 5 times the upper
limit of normal [ULN], total bilirubin 3 times ULN,
and stable disease for 2 weeks, especially after stenting). Each patient provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Research Ethics
Review Board of the Princess Margaret Hospital,
Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Patients were treated as previously reported.14
Capecitabine at a dose of 650 mg/m2 orally was
given twice daily for 14 consecutive days and gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was administered
intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8; both
drugs were given at 3-week intervals. Treatment was
continued until disease progression, unacceptable

toxicity, physician decision to remove the patient, or
withdrawal of patient consent. Information regarding
adverse events (recorded according to the Common
Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute of
Canada [version 2]), dose adjustments, and delays
have been previously reported and were not updated
for the current study.14 For the expanded cohort,
patients were assessed for toxicity at routine medical
visits and case report forms were not formally completed.
Baseline evaluation included medical history, physical examination, and assessment of tumor dimensions
(using computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scans of the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis performed within 28 days of study entry); CT/
MRI scans of the brain and bone scans were performed
if indicated by clinical findings. Tumor response was
assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria,15 with CT or MRI scans
repeated every 3 cycles of treatment. Responses were
evaluated by investigators.
Progression-free survival was defined as the time
from Day 1 of Cycle 1 of GemCap to the first documentation of progressive disease or death from any
cause (whichever came first), with patients being
censored on the last day of study follow-up if no disease progression had occurred. Summary statistics
were used to describe the medians, range, proportions, and frequencies. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate time-to-event outcomes.

RESULTS
Between July 2001 and January 2005, 75 patients
were enrolled in the current expanded phase 2 trial.
The charateristics of the patients are described in
Table 1. The median age was 61 years (range, 37–84
years) and greater than half of the patients were
male. Approximately 60% of patients had cholangiocarcinoma and 85% had metastatic disease at the
time of study enrollment. The great majority of
patients (98%) had not received any form of anticancer therapy; 1 patient with locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma received local external beam radiation
and 1 patient received postoperative radiation concurrently with gemcitabine for positive surgical margins. Greater than 60% of patients had undergone
biliary decompression either by stenting or bypass
surgery prior to the initiation of the study chemotherapy.
The total number of cycles delivered was 609
and the median duration of treatment was 6 months
(range, 5 weeks to 40 months). All 75 patients were
evaluable for efficacy outcomes. The proportion of

patients achieving best response as per RECIST criteria is described in Table 2. At a median follow-up
of 9.5 months (range, 1–49 months), the overall
response rate was 29% (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 19.4–41%), with a median duration of
9.7 months (range, 3–36 months). Three patients
achieved a complete response (1 patient with cholangiocarcinoma, 1 with gallbladder cancer, and 1
patient with an ampullary tumor), with a median
duration of response of 17 months (range, 9–27
months). The overall disease control (proportion of
patients who achieved tumor response and stable
disease) was 78%. The proportion of patients who
achieved an objective response was slightly higher
for gallbladder cancer patients than for cholangiocainoma patients (33% vs 24%); more patients with
gallbladder cancer developed early disease progression at 9 weeks (37% vs 16%) and had less stable
disease (30% vs 60%) compared with cholangiocarcinoma patients.
The median progression-free survival and overall
survival for the entire cohort were 6.2 months (95%
CI, 4.4–8.3 months) and 12.7 months (95% CI, 9.5–31
months), respectively. The estimated 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 9.8%
(95% CI, 4–23%) and 39% (95% CI, 29–53%), respectively. The median overall survival was 15.5 months
(95% CI, 12.3 months to not reached) for patients
with cholangiocarcinoma and was 7.7 months (95%
CI, 4.6 months to not reached) for patients with gallbladder tumors. The median progression-free survival was 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.2–12.2 months) for
cholangiocarcinoma patients and 4.4 months (95%

CI, .1–9.4 months) for gallbladder cancer patients. Of
75 patients, 73 developed disease progression during
the study period; 12 patients (16%) progressed locoregionally, 27 patients (37%) progressed at distant
sites, and 34 patients (47%) progressed in both local
and distant sites.
Twenty-one patients (6 patients with gallbladder
cancer and 15 patients with cholangiocarcinoma)
received 2 lines of anticancer therapy. As per
RECIST criteria evaluation, no objective responses
were observed. Seven patients were treated with
phase 1 drugs, 5 patients were rechallenged with
GemCap, 3 patients received cisplatin combined with
5-flurororacil, 2 patients received gemcitabine alone,
and 1 patient each received cisplatin and gemcitabine, cisplatin and irinotecan, the ECF regimen (epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil), and gefitinib.
The phase 1 drugs that patients received included a
vasopressin V1-A receptor antagonist combined with
irinotecan (3 patients) and tyrosine kynase inhibitors
(2 patients), and 1 patient each received an antisense
oligonucleotide targeting BCL-2 plus doxorubicin, a
histone deacetylase inhibitor agent, an oral topoisomerase inhibitor, and a metaloproteinase inhibitor. Of the 5 patients who received second-line
GemCap after a median treatment break of 4 months
(range, 3–14 months), 4 patients achieved stable disease for a median of 10 months (range, 4–11 months)
and 1 patient developed disease progression after 2
cycles. These 5 patients were rechallenged with GemCap because of progressive disease and their best
tumor responses with first-line GemCap were as follows: 3 patients achieved stable disease for a median of 18 months (range, 18–44 months), 1 patient
achieved a complete response lasting 27 months,
and 1 patient achieved a partial response lasting 12
months.
Reasons for discontinuing treatment included
progressive disease in 62 patients (83%), a chemo-

therapy break in 7 patients with stable disease (9%),
a chemotherapy break in 3 patients with a complete
response (4%), adverse events in 2 patients (3%; 1
patient had grade 3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia and 1 patient had gastrointestinal bleeding), and
the development of sepsis in 1 patient (1%). Transient neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and
hand-foot syndrome were commonly observed, but
were easily managed without discontinuing further
treatment. In this expanded cohort, the investigators
did not observe any adverse events that were not in
keeping with that which had been reported previously in the initial sample of 45 patients.

DISCUSSION
This expanded phase 2 trial lends further evidence
that the GemCap regimen is effective in patients with
advanced biliary cancers, with nearly one-third of
patients achieving an objective response and a median overall survival of nearly 13 months. At a total of
75 patients, the outcomes remain encouraging and
consistent with what was demonstrated within the
first 45-patient cohort.14 Patients with gallbladder
tumors had shorter overall and progression-free survival compared with patients with cholangiocarci-

noma. No objective responses were observed among
patients who received 2 lines of therapy. A few
patients who achieved long-term disease control with
first-line GemCap benefited from second-line GemCap in terms of disease stabilization.
To our knowledge, there is currently no standard
chemotherapy regimen for advanced biliary cancer.
Historically, chemotherapy has had little impact on
the natural history of this disease. This is because of
several reasons: a lack of active agents, the overall
morbidity of treatment and consequent reduced dose
intensity, and the grouping together of different cancer types with different biologies such as pancreatic
cancers and hepatocellular carcinomas. Older chemotherapy combinations with 5-fluorouracil have
demonstrated response rates of 0% to 10%. To our
knowledge, only 1 randomized study published to
date demonstrated an improvement in quality of life
for biliary cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracilbased chemotherapy versus best supportive care,
although no difference in overall survival was
observed.4 Regimens containing new agents such as
gemcitabine, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin have
demonstrated objective responses in 20% to 45% of
patients and a median survival of 8 to 14 months
(Table 3).12,16 The preliminary results of a large

Gemcitabine and Capecitabine for Biliary CA/Riechelmann et al.

randomized phase 2 trial of gemcitabine versus gemcitabine combined with cisplatin demonstrated that
both arms were active, although time to disease progression was longer in the combination arm (5.5
months vs 8 months).17
Many advances, including the blockade of angiogenesis-related signaling and epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) signaling, are being made in several
cancer types, including biliary cancer. Philip et al.
evaluated the oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
erlotinib in 42 patients with advanced biliary cancers.18 Approximately 60% of patients had received 1
prior chemotherapy regimen and 81% had tumors
expressing EGFR as detected by immunohistochemistry. In that study, 3 patients achieved a partial
response (7%) and 17% of patients were progression
free at 6 months.18 These results suggest a therapeutic benefit for EGFR blockade with erlotinib in some
patients with biliary cancers.
The GemCap regimen has consistenly shown promising results, as demonstrated by our expanded
phase 2 trial, which to our knowledge is 1 of the largest trials published to date regarding this disease, as
well as by other studies.19,20 Although the impact of
this regimen on patient survival warrants further evaluation in a randomized study, the results presented
herein suggest that GemCap may improve the survival
of biliary cancer patients, as evidenced by a reported
median survival of nearly 13 months (patients with
advanced biliary tumors usually survive <1year). In
addition, patients who achieved a complete response
had a median duration of response of 17 months. We
did not observe responses among those patients who
received 2 lines of anticancer therapy. Four of 5
patients who received second-line therapy with GemCap had disease stabilization for a median of 10
months, although these numbers are too small to
draw any conclusions and evidence of a benefit for
second-line therapy in biliary cancers currently is anecdotal.21,22 We observed that patients with gallbladder tumors developed more early disease progression
and less stable disease, and had shorter survival than
patients with cholangiocarcinoma. In the initial cohort
treated with GemCap, gallbladder cancer patients also
appeared to have a worse outcome, as demonstrated
by a Cox regression multivariate analysis.14
Limitations of the current study should be noted.
First, this was single-institution trial and patient
selection bias was possible. Second, we did not
update data regarding patient safety. The evaluation
of adverse events occurring in the expanded cohort
was performed at routine follow-up visits; however,
the formal collection of toxicity data into the case
report forms was not undertaken because of logistic

1311

matters. However, the study team did not identify
differences with regard to the type or frequency of
drug-related adverse events in comparison with what
has been reported previously.14 Lastly, the serum tumor marker CA 19-9 was not routinely available for
use during the current study and therefore no evaluation as to its usefulness in monitoring patient outcomes was performed.
In conclusion, encouraging antitumor activity as
reinforced by this larger patient cohort coupled with
a mild toxicity profile14 suggest that the GemCap
chemotherapy regimen may benefit patients with
advanced biliary cancers. The National Cancer Institute of Canada’s Clinical Trials Group will conduct a
randomized clinical trial to compare the GemCap
combination with single-agent gemcitabine, with
overall survival being the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints will include response and quality of
life. The study will stratify for cancer type (gallbladder vs bile duct cancer), performance status, and
extent of disease and will include a tumor banking
component. The trial will begin accrual in the
second semester of 2007 with the goal of establishing
a chemotherapy standard of care for patients with
biliary cancers.
