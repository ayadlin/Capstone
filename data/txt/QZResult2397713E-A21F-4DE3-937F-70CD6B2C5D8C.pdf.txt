Abstract

Author Manuscript

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated cell signaling is critical for mammary
epithelial cell growth and survival; however, targeting EGFR has shown no or only minimal
therapeutic benefit in patients with breast cancer. Here, we report a novel regulatory mechanism of
EGFR signaling that may explain the low response rates. We found that breast tumor kinase (Brk)/
protein-tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase highly expressed in most
human breast tumors, interacted with EGFR and sustained ligand-induced EGFR signaling. We
demonstrate that Brk inhibits ligand-induced EGFR degradation through uncoupling activated
EGFR from Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. In addition, upon activation by EGFR, Brk
directly phosphorylated Y845 in the EGFR kinase domain, thereby further potentiating EGFR
kinase activity. Experimental elevation of Brk conferred resistance of breast cancer cells to
cetuximab (an EGFR-blocking antibody)-induced inhibition of cell signaling and proliferation,
whereas knockdown of Brk sensitized the cells to cetuximab by inducing apoptosis. Our findings
reveal a previously unknown role of Brk in EGFR-targeted therapy.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in breast
tumorigenesis for more than two decades on the basis of numerous experimental, clinical,
and epidemiological studies; EGFR expression was reported to correlate with breast cancer
prognosis over 25 years ago (Sainsbury et al., 1985). The most recent studies show that
EGFR expression is correlated with breast cancer relapse in selected patients (Rimawi et al.,
2010). However, novel molecular therapeutic approaches targeting EGFR have shown no or
limited efficacy in breast cancer clinical trials, including in patients with the basal-like
breast cancer subtype, in which high EGFR expression is common (Normanno et al., 2005;
Corkery et al., 2009). Since EGFR is critically important for mammary epithelial cell
growth and survival (Taketani and Oka, 1983), we hypothesized that there exist mechanisms
in breast cancer that can render breast cancer cells insensitive to pharmacological inhibition
of EGFR; identification of such mechanisms may help to improve response to EGFRtargeted therapy in breast cancer.
Activation of EGFR by its ligands at the cell surface is followed by internalization of the
ligand-receptor complex via receptor-mediated endocytosis (Sorkin and Von Zastrow,
2009). After internalization, EGFR traffics through a series of endosomal compartments and
is either recycled back to the plasma membrane for continued signaling or routed to the
lysosomes for degradation. Ligand-induced EGFR internalization followed by lysosomal
degradation is an important negative feedback mechanism for regulating the amplitude and
kinetics of EGFR signaling. Failure of this mechanism for EGFR downregulation can result
in enhanced receptor signaling, which may lead to cell transformation and tumorigenesis
(Marmor and Yarden, 2004; Polo et al., 2004).

Author Manuscript

Although not necessary for EGFR internalization, ubiquitination of EGFR is required for
routing the receptor to sorting endosomes and, subsequently, to the lysosomal degradative
compartment (Huang et al., 2007). Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) is a ubiquitin ligase
that mediates ubiquitination of several growth factor receptors, including EGFR (Levkowitz
et al., 1998). Cbl targets activated EGFR for ubiquitination and subsequent endosomal
sorting mainly by direct binding to Y1045-phosphorylated EGFR and additionally by
indirect binding to the receptor through the Grb2 adaptor protein (Waterman et al., 2002;
Grovdal et al., 2004).

Author Manuscript

Breast tumor kinase (Brk; also known as protein-tyrosine kinase 6/PTK6) is a nonreceptor
tyrosine kinase originally identified in a screening of protein-tyrosine kinases expressed in
human melanocytes (Lee et al., 1993). It was later cloned from a metastatic breast cancer
cell line (Mitchell et al., 1994). Brk is overexpressed in the majority of breast tumors,
particularly in advanced invasive and metastatic tumors, but its expression is either low or
undetectable in normal breast epithelial cells (Mitchell et al., 1994; Barker et al., 1997; Born
et al., 2005; Ostrander et al., 2007). High expression of Brk is also found in several other
cancer types, including melanoma (Easty et al., 1997) and colon cancer (Llor et al., 1999).
Originally classified as a Src-related kinase, Brk lacks the Src-characteristic N-terminal
myristoylation consensus sequences necessary for fatty acid acylation and membrane
association, and its SH2 and SH3 domains are atypical (Qiu and Miller, 2002; Qiu and

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 April 04.

Miller, 2004). Brk is now considered a member of a novel family of soluble protein-tyrosine
kinases distantly related to c-Src (Serfas and Tyner, 2003). Brk is activated by EGF
stimulation of cells, and experimental elevation of Brk sensitizes immortalized
nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cells to EGF-induced mitogenic effects (Kamalati
et al., 1996) and protects cells from anoikis (Irie et al., 2010). Brk may regulate clathrinmediated EGFR endocytosis via phosphorylation of centaurin δ-2 (also known as ARAP1)
(Kang et al., 2010). Brk interacts with EGFR, and Brk also interacts closely with other
members of the EGFR family—HER2 (Born et al., 2005; Xiang et al., 2008) and HER3
(Kamalati et al., 2000)—to enhance HER2-induced activation of cell signaling and to
mediate EGF-stimulated HER3 phosphorylation. Brk can also interact with tyrosine kinase
receptor downstream substrates, such as Akt (Zhang et al., 2005) and insulin receptor
substrate-4 (Qiu et al., 2005), regulate heregulin-induced activation of ERK5 and p38 MAP
kinases in breast cancer cells (Ostrander et al., 2007), phosphorylate STAT3 (Liu et al.,
2006) and STAT5b (Weaver and Silva, 2007), and phosphorylate paxillin (Chen et al.,
2004) and p190RhoGAP-A (Shen et al., 2008) to promote breast carcinoma growth,
migration, and invasion.

Author Manuscript

In the current work, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the direct
interaction between EGFR and Brk. Our results support a novel model for the interaction,
which helps to unravel the role of Brk in mediating cell responses to EGF stimulation and
may lead to improved EGFR-targeted therapy in breast cancer.

Brk sensitizes cancer cells to EGF stimulation through inhibiting ligand-induced EGFR
degradation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Brk is commonly expressed in human breast cancer (Mitchell et al., 1994; Born et al., 2005;
Ostrander et al., 2007). Analysis of a panel of 16 breast cancer cell lines revealed Brk in 11
of the 16 cell lines, often at high levels (Figure 1a). Immunohistochemical staining showed
positive Brk staining in 67% (36/54) of breast cancer specimens from patients (Figure S1).
To investigate the role of Brk in regulating EGFR, we used SUM102 cells, which were
derived from an intraductal breast adenocarcinoma and are basal-like (estrogen receptor and
progesterone receptor negative, HER2 nonamplified, and CK5/6 and EGFR positive) (Sartor
et al., 1997; Forozan et al., 1999; Hoadley et al., 2007; Eck et al., 2009). SUM102 cells had
a relatively low level of Brk compared to the levels in other Brk-expressing breast cancer
cell lines and a detectable level of EGFR (Figure 1a). We found that experimental elevation
of Brk substantially sensitized cells (SUM102-Brk) to EGF-induced stimulation of cell
proliferation, compared to control vector-transfected cells (SUM102-neo) (Figure 1b).
Experimental elevation of Brk raised basal levels of activation-specific phosphorylation of
Akt and Erk and sensitized the cells to EGF-induced increases in Akt and Erk
phosphorylation (Figure 1c). Similar results were found in non-breast-cancer cell lines, such
as A431 human vulvar squamous carcinoma cells, which express an unusually high level of
EGFR (Figure S2a). Conversely, knockdown of Brk expression markedly reduced EGFinduced activation of cell signaling in SUM102 cells as well as in A431 cells (Figure 1d and

Figure S2b). These results strongly suggested that Brk sensitizes cells to EGFR-mediated
signal transduction.
We found that experimental elevation of Brk markedly inhibited downregulation of EGFR
after EGF-induced activation of EGFR tyrosine kinase in SUM102 breast cancer cells
(Figure 1e) as well as in A431 non-breast-cancer cells (Figure S2c). We then performed a
pulse-label and chase experiment to determine the half-life of EGFR upon EGF stimulation
in SUM102 and A431 cells with and without Brk overexpression. Compared with control
vector-transfected cells, in which over 80% of EGFR was degraded by the end of the chase
period, the Brk-transfected SUM102 and A431 cells exhibited almost no change in the level
of EGFR (Figure 1f and Figure S2d). These results strongly supported the conclusion that
overexpression of Brk inhibits ligand-induced degradation of EGFR.

Brk inhibits ligand-induced EGFR degradation through inhibiting EGFR-Cbl association
and Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination

Author Manuscript

To elucidate the mechanism by which Brk inhibits EGFR degradation, we compared the
levels of EGFR ubiquitination and the association of EGFR with Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase
known for regulating EGFR degradation (Levkowitz et al., 1998), in SUM102-neo and
SUM102-Brk cells after EGF stimulation. The association between EGFR and Cbl was
markedly reduced in SUM102-Brk cells compared with SUM102-neo cells at 15, 30, and 90
min after EGF stimulation (Figure 2a). Consistent with the reduction in EGFR-Cbl
association, the level of EGFR ubiquitination was lower in SUM102-Brk cells than in
SUM102-neo cells (Figure 2a). Conversely, knockdown of endogenous Brk expression in
SUM102 cells markedly increased the levels of EGFR-Cbl association and EGFR
ubiquitination (Figure 2b). These results strongly indicated that Brk can inhibit EGFinduced EGFR-Cbl association and subsequent Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination.

Author Manuscript

To ascertain whether this Brk-mediated inhibition of EGF-induced EGFR-Cbl association
and subsequent EGFR ubiquitination was directly linked to Brk kinase activity and
expression, we examined the effects of expression of wild-type Brk, a constitutively active
Brk mutant (Brk-Y447F), and a kinase-dead Brk mutant (Brk-K219M) on the levels of
EGFR-Cbl association and EGFR ubiquitination in SUM102 cells (Figure 2c). To permit
visualization of the basal levels of EGFR-Cbl association and EGFR ubiquitination in
unstimulated SUM102 cells, the blots in Figure 2c were overexposed compared to those in
Figures 2a and 2b. We found that the level of EGFR-Cbl association was reduced in the cells
transfected with wild-type Brk, more profoundly reduced in the cells transfected with BrkY447F, and only minimally reduced in the cells transfected with Brk-K219M. The changes
in the level of EGFR ubiquitination correlated well with the reductions in the level of
EGFR-Cbl association. Similar results were found in A431 cells (Figure S3a). Inhibition of
EGFR ubiquitination with overexpression of wild-type Brk was stronger in A431 cells than
in SUM102 cells, likely because the wild-type Brk was activated by autocrine TGF-α, which
is known to exist in A431 cells (Figure S3a). Indeed, similar to the findings after EGF
treatment, TGF-α-induced EGFR-Cbl association and EGFR ubiquitination were also
inhibited by Brk (Figure S3b).

Together, these findings indicated that Brk inhibits ligand-induced EGFR degradation after
EGFR activation through interfering with EGFR-Cbl association and subsequent Cblmediated EGFR ubiquitination and that the kinase activity of Brk plays an important role in
the process.
Brk inhibits Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination through competing with Cbl for binding to
the Y1045 phosphorylation site on EGFR

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To elucidate the mechanism by which Brk inhibits Cbl-EGFR association, we first examined
the dependence of EGFR-Brk association on EGFR activity. EGF-induced EGFR-Brk
association was strongly inhibited by a small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
gefitinib, in SUM102-Brk cells (Figure 3a) as well as in A431-Brk cells (Figure S4),
indicating that EGFR kinase activity is required for EGFR-Brk association. Next, we asked
whether Brk kinase activity is also required for EGFR-Brk association. Because no Brk
specific inhibitor is currently available, we used a genomic approach to coexpress wild-type
EGFR and wild-type Brk or wild-type EGFR and kinase-dead Brk (Brk-K219M) in Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which have no detectable level of endogenous Brk or EGFR.
Experimental elevation of EGFR can induce receptor activation due to receptor
homodimerization, which led to a moderate EGFR-Brk association in Brk
immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells cotransfected with wild-type EGFR and wildtype Brk (Figure 3b); the association was markedly increased after EGF stimulation. In
contrast, in cells cotransfected with wild-type EGFR and kinase-dead Brk, no EGFR-Brk
association was seen in unstimulated cells, and only a minimal level of EGFR-Brk
association was seen after EGF stimulation. Similar results were seen in EGFR
immunoprecipitates (Figure 3b), although the difference was not as marked as in Brk
immunoprecipitates, possibly because immunoprecipitation of myc-tagged EGFR with antimyc antibody was less complete than immunoprecipitation of Brk with anti-Brk antibody. In
any case, the data supported the conclusion that Brk kinase activity is required for EGFRBrk association.

Author Manuscript

Because phosphorylated Y1045 on EGFR is a major docking site for Cbl (Levkowitz et al.,
1998), we tested the hypothesis that Brk inhibits Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination by
competitively binding to Y1045-phosphorylated EGFR. We used CHO cells with
coexpression of wild-type EGFR or EGFR-Y1045F mutant with Brk to eliminate potential
interference from endogenous levels of related proteins. Using the same experimental
approach as in Figure 3b, we found massive amounts of wild-type EGFR, but not EGFRY1045F, in Brk immunoprecipitates of cells after EGF stimulation (Figure 3c). Reciprocal
EGFR immunoprecipitation showed that an increased amount of Brk coimmunoprecipitated
with wild-type EGFR but not with EGFR-Y1045; however, as in Figure 3b, the difference
was not as marked as in Brk immunoprecipitates. Furthermore, we found that activationspecific phosphorylation of Brk Y342 was increased in EGF-stimulated CHO cells
cotransfected with Brk and wild-type EGFR but not in EGF-stimulated CHO cells
cotransfected with Brk and mutant EGFR-Y1045F (Figure 3c). These findings supported a
model wherein EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation is essential not only for EGFR-Brk
association but also for activation of Brk after EGF treatment.

We next asked whether Brk and Cbl competitively bind to the same phosphorylated Y1045
site on EGFR. We correlated the level of EGFR-Cbl association with the level of EGFR-Brk
association in CHO cells transfected with increasing amounts of Brk constructs. Figure 3d
clearly shows an inverse relationship: with stepwise increases in the levels of Brk
expression, the levels of EGFR-Brk association also increased, whereas the levels of EGFRCbl association correspondingly decreased. These findings indicated that Brk can compete
with Cbl for binding to the phosphorylated Y1045 site on EGFR. Thus, Brk competes with
Cbl for binding to Y1045-phosphorylated EGFR, thereby interfering with Cbl-mediated
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of EGFR.

Author Manuscript

In addition, we found a positive correlation between Brk cDNA dose-dependent expression
and EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation (Figure 3d, blot for EGFR-Yp), suggesting that
Brk may have a direct role in regulating EGFR phosphorylation and functional
consequences.
Brk phosphorylates EGFR on Y845 independently of Src or HER activity

Author Manuscript

As previously mentioned, experimental elevation of wild-type EGFR alone can induce
EGFR autophosphorylation due to receptor homodimerization; however, we found that
coexpression of EGFR with the constitutively active Brk mutant Brk-Y447F resulted in
higher levels of total and site-specific EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (particularly at Y845
and Y1045) than expression of EGFR alone or coexpression of EGFR with the kinase-dead
Brk mutant Brk-K219M (Figure 4a; lanes 2-4, short exposures of blots of EGFR-Yp and
EGFR-Y845p). This finding indicated that Brk-Y447 likely enhances EGFR
autophosphorylation, directly phosphorylates EGFR, or both. Because wild-type Brk, when
cotransfected with EGFR, can be moderately activated in CHO cells without EGF
stimulation (Figure 3b, blot for Brk-Y342p), we used Brk-K219M instead of wild-type Brk
as a negative control for Brk-Y447F in this experiment and the following experiments.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether EGFR can be a substrate for Brk, we used a kinase-dead EGFR
mutant (EGFR-K721A), which produced no EGFR autophosphorylation when expressed
alone (Figure 4a, lane 5). EGFR total and Y845 phosphorylation levels were higher when
EGFR-K721A was coexpressed with Brk-Y447F than when EGFR-K721A was coexpressed
with Brk-K219M (Figure 4a, lanes 5-7, long exposures of blots of EGFR-Yp and EGFRY845p; note: only the long-exposed films that had positive findings are shown). Although
EGFR total and Y845 phosphorylation levels were low in the absence of EGFR kinase
activity, this result clearly indicated that Brk-Y447F can phosphorylate EGFR Y845. No
increased phosphorylation of EGFR on Y992, Y1045, Y1068, or Y1173 was detected by
their respective phosphorylation site-specific antibodies (Yamaoka et al., 2011) when
EGFR-K721A was coexpressed with Brk-Y447F (Figure 4a).
To further confirm that Y845 of EGFR can be phosphorylated by Brk-Y447F, we created an
EGFR-K721A/Y845F double mutant. As expected, no Y845 phosphorylation was observed
when EGFR-K721A/Y845F was coexpressed with Brk-Y447F in CHO cells; however, total
tyrosine phosphorylation on EGFR-K721A/Y845F was not completely eliminated despite
being clearly decreased (Figure 4a, lanes 8-10 of the short- and long-exposed EGFR-Y845p
and EGFR-Yp blots). These findings indicated that Y845 of EGFR-K721A was

phosphorylated when EGFR-K721A was coexpressed with Brk-Y447F but that additional
tyrosine site(s) may also have been phosphorylated by Brk-Y447F.

Author Manuscript

Y845 of EGFR is a known Src phosphorylation site (Tice et al., 1999; Biscardi et al., 1999).
We found that coexpression of EGFR-K721A and Brk-Y447F resulted in similar levels of
Y845 phosphorylation on EGFR-K721A in cells with and without siRNA-mediated
knockdown of Src (Figure 4b, lane 3 versus lane 5 of the EGFR-Y845p blot), indicating that
Brk may phosphorylate EGFR Y845 independently of Src. Because the siRNA-mediated
transient silencing of Src expression may be incomplete, and also because multiple members
of the Src family, as well as the members of the HER family, may also phosphorylate Y845
of EGFR, we further treated cells with dasatinib (a Src family inhibitor) and lapatinib (a
HER2/EGFR dual inhibitor) to confirm our findings. Figure 4c shows that, despite strong
inhibition of Src by dasatinib (lanes 4-6 of the Src-Y416p blot), Y845 of EGFR-Y721A was
still phosphorylated in cells cotransfected with EGFR-Y721A and Brk-Y447F (lane 5 of the
EGFR-Y845p blot), whereas it was not phosphorylated in cells cotransfected with EGFRY721A and vector control (lane 4) or Brk-K219M (lane 6). There was a weak crossinhibition of Brk-Y447F by dasatinib (lane 5 versus lane 2 or 8 of the Brk-Y342p blot; note:
similar results were observed in cells treated with PP2, another Src inhibitor; data not
shown). Thus, Y845 phosphorylation was less in dasatinib-treated cells (lane 5) than in
vehicle-treated (lane 2) or lapatinib-treated cells (lane 8); however, the data clearly
supported the conclusion that Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR in CHO cells cotransfected
with Brk-Y447F and EGFR-Y721A is primarily Src independent.

Author Manuscript

Although CHO cells express HER2, we did not detect any phosphorylated HER2 when the
cells were transfected with EGFR-Y721A and control vector, Brk-Y447F, or Brk-K219M
(Figure 4c, blots of HER2 and HER2-p), nor did we detect any effect of lapatinib on BrkY447F-induced EGFR Y845 phosphorylation (lanes 7-9 of the EGFR-Y845p blot). This
experiment rules out involvement of HER2 in Brk-Y447F-mediated Y845 phosphorylation
of EGFR.

Author Manuscript

Lastly, to confirm that Brk can directly phosphorylate Y845 of EGFR, we conducted an in
vitro Brk kinase assay by incubating GST fusion proteins containing the kinase domain of
EGFR-K721A or EGFR-K721A/Y845F with a recombinant Brk protein in the presence or
absence of ATP (Figure 4d). Consistent with the findings in Figure 4a, after incubation with
recombinant Brk and ATP, Y845 EGFR phosphorylation was detected in the GST protein
fused with EGFR-K721A kinase domain but not in the GST protein fused with EGFRK721A/Y845F kinase domain, strongly indicating that Brk can directly phosphorylate Y845
of EGFR. Interestingly, the Y845-phosphorylated EGFR antibody also detected
phosphorylated Brk, which was autophosphorylated in the presence of ATP. In vitro
incubation of full-length EGFR-K721A and EGFR-K721A/Y845F proteins
immunoprecipitated from CHO cells also confirmed phosphorylation of EGFR on Y845 as
well as on some not-yet-identified sites by recombinant Brk (Figure S5); the additional
phosphorylation sites will be determined in separate studies.

Brk phosphorylation of EGFR-Y845 potentiates EGFR functions

Author Manuscript

To investigate the role of Brk-induced EGFR Y845 phosphorylation in EGFR function, we
analyzed EGF-induced association between EGFR and Brk in CHO cells cotransfected with
wild-type Brk and either wild-type EGFR or EGFR-Y845F mutant. Figure 5a shows that the
EGF-induced association between Brk and EGFR-Y845F was substantially less than the
EGF-induced association between Brk and wild-type EGFR, suggesting that Brk-induced
EGFR Y845 phosphorylation is important, although not essential, for EGFR-Brk
association. Both Brk Y342 and EGFR Y1045 were phosphorylated following EGF
stimulation of cells cotransfected with Brk and EGFR-Y845F mutant, but the levels were
less than those in cells cotransfected with Brk and wild-type EGFR (Figure 5a).

Author Manuscript

Because EGF-induced association between EGFR and Brk is EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation
dependent (Figure 3c), we next compared the levels of EGFR-Brk association in CHO cells
expressing various combinations of EGFR constructs (wild type, EGFR-Y1045F, and
EGFR-Y845F) and Brk constructs (Brk-Y447F and Brk-K219M) to further analyze the roles
of Brk kinase activity and Brk-induced EGFR Y845 phosphorylation in EGFR-Brk
association (Figure 5b). These experiments with various combinations of EGFR and Brk
constructs produced three main findings. First, while there was only a minimal association
between wild-type EGFR and kinase-dead Brk-K219M, there was a marked association
between wild-type EGFR and constitutively active Brk-Y447F (Figure 5b, lanes 2-4 of the
blots of EGFR for Brk immunoprecipitates [I.P. α Brk] and Brk for EGFR
immunoprecipitates [I.P. α EGFR]), and phosphorylation of EGFR on both Y845 and
Y1045 was higher with wild-type EGFR and Brk-Y447F than with wild-type EGFR and
Brk-K219M (lanes 2-4 of the blots of EGFR-Y845p and EGFR-Y1045p). Second, mutation
of EGFR Y1045 abolished the association between EGFR and Brk-Y447F (Figure 5b, lanes
5-7 versus lanes 2-4 of the blots of EGFR for Brk immunoprecipitates [I.P. α Brk] and vice
versa) but did not affect Brk-Y447F-induced phosphorylation of EGFR Y845 (lane 3 versus
lane 6 of the EGFR-Y845p blot). Compared with the result in Figure 3c, which showed that
activation of wild-type Brk by EGF is EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation dependent, this finding
with constitutively active Brk-Y447F indicated that, once activated, Brk can phosphorylate
Y845 of EGFR independently of Y1045 phosphorylation. Third, mutation of EGFR Y845
markedly reduced the association between Brk-Y447F and EGFR (Figure 5b, lanes 8-10
versus lanes 2-4 of the blots of EGFR for Brk immunoprecipitates [I.P. α Brk] and vice
versa) and also markedly reduced Brk-Y447F-induced phosphorylation of EGFR Y1045
(lane 3 versus lane 9 of the EGFR-Y1045p blot). These findings indicated that Brk-Y447Finduced EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation is dependent on prior Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR
Y845 phosphorylation.

Author Manuscript

Our data in Figure 4 indicated that Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation is
EGFR kinase dependent because it was not seen with EGFR-K721A (Figure 4a, lanes 2-4
versus lanes 5-7 of the EGFR-Y1045p blot). In contrast, Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR Y845
phosphorylation was not EGFR kinase dependent because it was seen with EGFR-K721A
(Figure 4a, lanes 5-7 of the long-exposed EGFR-Y845p blot). However, Brk-Y447Finduced EGFR Y845 phosphorylation was markedly higher on wild-type EGFR than on
EGFR-K721A (Figure 4a, lane 3 versus lane 6 of the long-exposed EGFR-Y845p blot),

indicating a role of EGFR kinase in Y845 phosphorylation. We thus further compared the
levels of Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR Y845 and Y1045 phosphorylation in CHO cells with
and without inhibition of EGFR kinase activity with gefitinib. Figure 5c shows that gefitinib
treatment markedly decreased Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR Y845 phosphorylation, although
EGFR Y845 phosphorylation could still be detected in gefitinib-treated cells (lane 6 versus
lane 3 of the EGFR-Y845p blot). In contrast, Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR Y1045
phosphorylation was barely detected in the gefitinib-treated cells (lane 6 versus lane 3 of the
EGFR-Y1045p blot). These findings confirmed that EGFR kinase activity is required for
Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation and indicated that EGFR kinase activity
affects the level of but is not required for the occurrence of Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR
Y845 phosphorylation. These findings also explained why Brk-Y447F can induce EGFR
Y845 phosphorylation but the phosphorylation is much weaker in the kinase-dead EGFRK721A than in the kinase-functional wild-type EGFR (Figure 4a). In addition, it appears that
there was a slightly increased phosphorylation of EGFR Y1045 with Brk-K129M,
supporting a previously described adaptor function for the kinase-dead protein (Harvey and
Crompton, 2003; 2004).
Taken together, these findings indicated that Brk phosphorylates EGFR on Y845, which in
turn enhances EGFR phosphorylation on Y1045, which is EGFR kinase dependent.
Phosphorylation of EGFR Y1045 leads to further increase in EGFR-Brk association and Brk
activation, which decreases EGFR-Cbl association and EGFR ubiquitination. Thus, the
repetitive cycles between Brk activation and EGFR Y845/Y1045 phosphorylation constitute
a positive feedback loop, through which EGFR activation-induced cell signaling is sustained
and amplified.

Knockdown of Brk sensitizes breast cancer cells to EGFR-targeted therapy

Author Manuscript

The above-described novel functions of Brk suggested that Brk could sustain activated
EGFR signaling and thus augment cell response to EGF stimulation and reduce the
dependence of cells on new EGFR activation. To substantiate this critical role of Brk in
breast cancer cells, we knocked down endogenous Brk in SUM102 breast cancer cells and
confirmed that the knockdown did lower the level of EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation
at Y845, Y1045, Y1068 and Y1173 (Figure 6a). Knockdown of Brk sensitized SUM102
cells to cetuximab, an EGFR-blocking antibody that is approved for treatment of several
types of human solid tumors, as shown by greater induction of apoptosis (measured by two
independent apoptosis assays: DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage) in cells treated with
Brk siRNA and cetuximab than in cells treated with either treatment alone (Figure 6b).
Conversely, experimental elevation of Brk lowered the levels of inhibition of Akt and Erk
phosphorylation by cetuximab in SUM102 cells compared with the levels in control vectortransfected SUM102 cells (Figure 6c). Consistent with the results of Western blot analysis,
the Brk-transfected SUM102 cells required higher doses of cetuximab to achieve the same
level of growth inhibition as observed in the control vector-transfected cells, and this effect
was more apparent in the cells transfected with constitutively active Brk-Y447F (Figure 6d).
Similar results were found in A431 cells (Figure S6). Together, these data confirmed that
knockdown of Brk can sensitize breast cancer cells to EGFR-targeted therapy whereas a

high level of Brk expression can lower the sensitivity of cancer cells to EGFR-targeted
therapy.

Discussion
In this study, we found that Brk plays important roles in regulating EGFR function in both
breast cancer cells and non-breast-cancer cells. Our data suggest a new model, depicted in
Figure 7, through which Brk sustains activated EGFR signaling, sensitizes cancer cells to
EGF stimulation, and renders Brk-overexpressing cells less sensitive to EGFR-blocking
antibodies than cells with low or no Brk expression.

There are several key novel findings of this study. First, we demonstrated that the EGFinduced EGFR-Brk association is EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation dependent. One early study
compared several growth factor-mediated cell signaling pathways, including those of
fibroblast growth factors (acidic or basic), nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth
factor-BB, insulin, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Kamalati et al., 1996), and
found that Brk enhanced the cellular response only to EGF stimulation and that Brk was
activated only by EGF stimulation. Our current work now provides a mechanistic insight
into this observation by demonstrating the unique requirement of EGFR Y1045
phosphorylation for EGFR-Brk association and Brk activation by EGFR. Second, we
unraveled a novel interaction between EGFR, Brk, and Cbl. We showed that Brk can inhibit
ligand-induced EGFR degradation after receptor activation. We demonstrated that binding
of Brk to the Y1045 site of EGFR inhibits Cbl binding to the same site. The competition
between Brk and Cbl for binding to EGFR constitutes a novel mechanism of uncoupling of
activated EGFR from ubiquitination and degradation. One recent study showed that Brk can
also inhibit EGFR endocytosis (Kang et al., 2010). Together, these findings indicate that Brk
inhibits EGFR downregulation through multiple interacting mechanisms. Third, we showed
that the Y845 site of EGFR can be directly phosphorylated by Brk. Brk-mediated EGFR
Y845 phosphorylation further potentiates EGFR function and the interaction between EGFR
and Brk. Lastly, we showed that knockdown of Brk sensitized breast cancer cells to
cetuximab treatment whereas experimental elevation of Brk conferred resistance to
cetuximab treatment.

Author Manuscript

The effect of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases on uncoupling activated EGFR from
endocytosis and degradation is emerging as an integral part of the oncogenic activation of
EGFR, together with EGFR gene amplification and protein overexpression or mutation;
however, such mechanisms have not yet been explored in the context of targeted therapy.
Given that Brk is widely expressed in breast cancer (Mitchell et al., 1994; Barker et al.,
1997; Ostrander et al., 2007), that EGFR plays critical roles in breast tumorigenesis, and that
targeting EGFR has been disappointing overall in breast cancer, our findings justify the
development of novel Brk inhibitors, which may be used alone and in combination with
EGFR inhibitors for treating patients with breast cancer.

Brk sensitizes breast cancer cells to EGF stimulation by inhibiting ligand-induced EGFR
degradation. (a) Brk was overexpressed more often than EGFR in breast cancer cell lines.
Expression of Brk and EGFR in the indicated breast cancer cells was detected by Western
blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control. (b) Brk sensitizes breast cancer cells to EGFinduced cell proliferation. SUM102-neo and SUM102-Brk cells were cultured in the
presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of EGF in 0.5% FBS medium for 5 days.
Relative cell growth and survival were determined by an MTT assay. (c) Brk enhances EGFinduced activation of cell signaling. Following transient transfection with Brk or vector for
24 h, SUM102 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of EGF in 0.5% FBS
medium for 10 min and then harvested for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies.
(d) Knockdown of Brk expression decreases EGF-induced activation of cell signaling.
Forty-eight hours after knockdown of Brk by siRNA, SUM102 cells were treated with the
indicated concentrations of EGF in 0.5% FBS medium for 10 min and then harvested for
Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (e) Brk sustains activated EGFR level and
signaling. SUM102 cells were treated with 10 μM cycloheximide for 30 min prior to
incubation with 10 nM EGF in 0.5% FBS medium for the indicated time periods. Cell
lysates were harvested for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. EGFR-Yp = total
phosphorylated EGFR. (f) Brk inhibits EGF-induced EGFR degradation. 35S-labeled
methionine metabolic-labeled SUM102 cells were pulse-chased for up to 120 min in the
presence or absence of 10 nM EGF in 0.5% FBS medium. The levels of EGFR
immunoprecipitated at 30, 60, and 120 min were quantified by densitometry and plotted
against the pulse-chase time period. Note: The ratios in this figure and in other figures
represent quantitative analysis of densitometric values of specific band intensities
normalized to the densitometric value of the leftmost lane in the same gel, which has a

(a) Brk-Y447F increases EGFR phosphorylation in an EGFR kinase-dependent manner but
can increase EGFR Y845 phosphorylation independently of EGFR kinase activity. CHO
cells were transiently cotransfected for 24 h with a construct containing neo control vector,
wild-type EGFR (EGFR-wt), kinase-dead EGFR (EGFR-K721A), or EGFR-K721/Y845F
double-mutant and a construct containing neo control vector, constitutively actively Brk
(Brk-Y447F), or kinase-dead Brk (Brk-K219M) as indicated. Whole cell lysates were
analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. EGFR-Yp = total
phosphorylated EGFR. Exp. = exposure time. (b and c) Brk-Y447F increases EGFR Y845
phosphorylation independently of Src or HER kinase activity. In (b), CHO cells were
subjected to Src siRNA or control siRNA treatment for 48 h. The cells were then
cotransfected for 24 h with EGFR-K721A and either Brk-Y447F or Brk-K219M. CHO cells
transfected with a control vector or EGFR-wt were used as controls. In (c), CHO cells were
cotransfected for 24 h with EGFR-K721A and control vector, Brk-Y447F, or Brk-K219M.
The cells were then treated with 10 μM dasatinib or lapatinib or vehicle control (DMSO) as
indicated for overnight. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with the
indicated antibodies. (d) Brk directly phosphorylates Y845 of EGFR in vitro. GST-fusion
proteins containing the kinase domain of EGFR-K721A or EGFR-K721A/Y845F were
incubated with recombinant Brk in the presence of ATP for 30 min at 30°C. The products of
this in vitro kinase reaction were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies.

Brk promotes EGFR-Brk interaction through phosphorylating EGFR Y845. (a) Mutation of
EGFR Y845 reduces EGF-induced EGFR-Brk association. CHO cells were transiently
cotransfected with Brk and wild-type EGFR or EGFR-Y845F for 24 h and then treated with
10 nM EGF for 5 min or not. CHO cells transfected with control vector were used as
controls. Brk and EGFR immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates were subjected to
Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (b) Brk-Y447F induces EGFR Y1045
phosphorylation and promotes EGFR-Brk association through phosphorylating EGFR Y845.
CHO cells were transiently cotransfected for 24 h with a construct containing neo vector,
wild-type EGFR (EGFR-wt), EGFR-Y1045F, or EGFR-Y845F and a construct containing
neo vector, Brk-Y447F, or Brk-K219M as indicated. Brk and EGFR immunoprecipitates
and whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (c)
EGFR kinase activity is required for Brk-Y447F-induced EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation.
CHO cells were cotransfected with wild-type Brk and control vector, Brk-Y447F, or BrkK219M for 24 h. The cells were then treated with 0.5 μM gefitinib or vehicle control
(DMSO) for 16 h. Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated
antibodies.

Brk confers resistance of breast cancer cells to EGFR inhibition. (a) Knockdown of Brk
reduces breast cancer cell response to EGF stimulation. SUM102 cells were subjected to
treatment with Brk-specific siRNA or control siRNA for 48 h prior to serum starvation for
overnight. The next day, the cells were treated with 10 nM EGF or not for 30 min and
harvested for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (b) Knockdown of Brk
sensitizes breast cancer cells to cetuximab. SUM102 cells were subjected to Brk knockdown
as in (a) and then treated with 20 nM cetuximab or not for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared
for apoptosis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting with the indicated
antibodies. O.D., optical density. (c) Overexpression of Brk confers resistance to cetuximabinduced inhibition of cell signaling. SUM102 cells selected for overexpression of wild-type
Brk and corresponding control cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of
cetuximab in 0.5% FBS culture medium for 16 h. Whole cell lysates were subjected to
Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (d) Overexpression of Brk confers resistance
to cetuximab-induced growth inhibition. SUM102 cells selected for overexpression of wildtype Brk or Brk-Y447F and corresponding control cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of cetuximab for 5 days. Cell survival and proliferation after cetuximab
treatment were measured with an MTT assay and plotted as a percentage of the optical
density at 570 nm of the untreated cells. ■ = Control vector-transfected cells; ● = wildtype-Brk-transfected cells; ▲ = Brk-Y447F-transfected cells.

Proposed model of novel roles of Brk in augmenting EGFR signaling. Upon EGF
stimulation, several sites on EGFR, including Y1045, are phosphorylated (step 1). In cells
with no or a low level of Brk expression (left panel), Cbl binds to phosphorylated Y1045 on
EGFR (step 2), leading to EGFR ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In cells with a
high level of Brk expression (right panel), Brk competes with Cbl for binding to
phosphorylated Y1045, preventing Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination and degradation (step
2, see Figures 2 and 3). The association between EGFR and Brk leads to activation of Brk
(step 3, see Figure 3), and the activated Brk can phosphorylate EGFR Y845 (step 4, see
Figure 4), which increases EGFR Y1045 phosphorylation in an EGFR kinase-dependent
manner and further potentiates the association between EGFR and Brk and activation of new
Brk molecules (step 5, see Figure 5). Therefore, Brk inhibits EGFR-Cbl association and
promotes EGFR-Brk association through this positive feedback loop between EGFR and
Brk. P = phosphorylation; Ub = ubiquitination.
