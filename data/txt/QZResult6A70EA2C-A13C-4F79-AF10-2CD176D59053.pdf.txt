which function as master regulators that coordinate cell growth
(mass), cell metabolism, and division and which are activated in up
to 70% of rapidly dividing malignancies. Their selective activation in
cancer likely reflects their regulation of a large cast of genes
involved in cell metabolism and proliferation, as well as in tumor
angiogenesis and metastasis (5). Indeed, expression profiling and
genome-wide chromatin binding analyses suggest that Myc can
regulate the transcription of up to 15% of the genome (6, 7).
Enforced expression of Myc in transgenic mouse models is sufficient
to provoke a wide array of malignancies that accurately phenocopy
human malignancies (8–11). This is particularly true of the tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) promoter-driven expression of N-Myc in neural
crest progenitors that gives rise to a malignancy that faithfully
recapitulates MYCN-amplified stage IV neuroblastoma, including
shared syntenic chromosomal alterations (9).
A hallmark of cancer is that sustained expression or activity of
oncogenic lesions are necessary to maintain the malignant state,
and this especially applies to tumors driven by Myc, wherein even
rather brief inactivation of Myc usually leads to complete tumor
regression (12, 13). Thus, targeting Myc directly (e.g., blocking its
transcription or translation or augmenting its turnover) could be
therapeutic, yet Myc oncoproteins are also required for the growth
of most normal cell types (14, 15), raising concerns of acquiring a
suitable therapeutic index. Furthermore, the complexity of Myc’s
transcriptional response raises questions regarding which targets
downstream of Myc to choose and whether intervention through
any single target will show efficacy.
Ornithine decarboxylase (Odc), the first and a rate-limiting
enzyme in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, is a wellcharacterized, direct Myc transcription target (16, 17) clearly
amenable to therapeutic intervention. Odc converts ornithine into
putrescine, which is then converted into the more abundant
polyamines spermidine and spermine (Supplementary Fig. S1),
which control various aspects of cell biology, including replication,
translation, and cell growth and survival (18, 19). Accordingly,
polyamine levels are tightly maintained in cells, and these controls
include the catabolic arm of the pathway that allows for back
conversion (Supplementary Fig. S1) and, for Odc, also include
regulation of its translation and turnover, which is directed by a
dedicated inhibitor, coined antizyme, that directly shuttles Odc to
the proteasome for destruction. In turn, an Odc decoy, coined
antizyme inhibitor, dampens antizyme activity (reviewed in ref. 19).
Elevated Odc levels and accompanying increases in polyamine
pools are common in cancer (18), and enforced Odc expression in
the skin of transgenic mice leads to increased tumor incidence and
rate in response to chemical carcinogens (20, 21). Furthermore, like
Myc, Odc cooperates with activated Ras in transformation in vitro
and in vivo (22, 23). Notably, Odc heterozygosity or treatment with
the difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a suicide inhibitor of Odc,
impairs Myc-induced lymphomagenesis in EA-Myc transgenic mice

Abstract
Neuroblastoma is a pediatric malignancy that arises from the
neural crest, and patients with high-risk neuroblastoma,
which typically harbor amplifications of MYCN, have an
extremely poor prognosis. The tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
promoter-driven TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model faithfully
recapitulates many hallmarks of human MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma. A key downstream target of Myc oncoproteins
in tumorigenesis is ornithine decarboxylase (Odc), the ratelimiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis. Indeed, sustained
treatment with the Odc suicide inhibitor A-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) or Odc heterozygosity markedly impairs
lymphoma development in EM-Myc transgenic mice, and these
effects are linked to the induction of the cyclin-dependent
kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1, which is normally repressed by
Myc. Here, we report that DFMO treatment, but not Odc
heterozygosity, impairs MYCN-induced neuroblastoma and
that, in this malignancy, transient DFMO treatment is
sufficient to confer protection. The selective anticancer effects
of DFMO on mouse and human MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma also rely on its ability to disable the proliferative response
of Myc, yet in this tumor context, DFMO targets the expression
of the p21Cip1 Cdk inhibitor, which is also suppressed by Myc
oncoproteins. These findings suggest that agents, such as
DFMO, that target the polyamine pathway may show efficacy
in high-risk, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is a childhood malignancy that accounts for
nearly 8% of all childhood cancers and 15% of pediatric cancer–
related deaths (1). This tumor arises from sympathetic nervous
tissue, most commonly in the adrenal gland, and its onset is agedependent, with an incidence, during the first year of life, twice that
of the second. Furthermore, neuroblastoma is the most common
cancer during infancy, with an incidence nearly twice that of
pediatric leukemia. Tragically, children with stage IV, high-risk
neuroblastoma have a <40% long-term survival (2).
The best-described genetic alteration in neuroblastoma is the
amplification of the proto-oncogene MYCN, which occurs in f20%
of all neuroblastoma and is associated with the high-risk phenotype
(3, 4). MYCN is a member of the Myc family of transcription factors,

fetal bovine serum, 1 L-glutamine, 1 MEM nonessential amino acids, and
1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37jC, 5% CO2. Cells were harvested for
protein and RNA analyses. For treatment with DFMO, cells were split at
2.5  106 into 15-cm plates for protein analyses and 4  105 into 6-cm
plates for RNA and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses
4 h before 5 mmol/L DFMO treatment. Cells were cultured in the presence
of DFMO for 72 h and then harvested for protein, RNA, or FACS analyses.
For growth curve analysis, 1  105 cells were plated into six-well plates
4 h before 5 mmol/L DFMO or mock treatment. Each day, three wells of
mock-treated and three wells of DFMO-treated cells were individually
collected and counted. Cells were counted using a Cellometer Auto T4 cell
counter (Nexcelom Bioscience).
Mice and tumor analyses. Mice expressing the human MYCN gene
under the control of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase promoter (TH-MYCN;
ref. 9) were maintained on a 129x1/SvJ background. TH-MYCN littermates
were given either water, water containing 1% DFMO from weaning (f21 d)
to sacrifice, or water containing 1% DFMO from weaning to 120 d of age.
TH-MYCN were also bred to Odc +/ mice (ref. 29; on a 94% 129x1/SvJ
background) to generate TH-MYCN;Odc +/+ and TH-MYCN;Odc +/ littermates (97% 129x1/SvJ background). Mice were monitored daily for illness
and tumor development. Sick animals were sacrificed, and tumors were
collected, snap frozen, and stored at 80jC.
Flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was performed by using the FITC
BrdU flow kit (559619, BD Biosciences). DFMO-treated or mock-treated
(72 h) cultured cells were incubated with 10 Amol/L BrdUrd for 30 min and
collected by trypsinization. Cells were stained for BrdUrd incorporation and
cell cycle, as previously described (24). Stained cells were analyzed using a
BD FACSCanto II; doublets were excluded based on pulse width/height and
separated based on FITC staining (BrdUrd incorporation) versus 7-AAD
(cell cycle).

(24), a model of human B-cell lymphoma (8). In B cells, targeting
Odc selectively impairs the proliferative response of Myc by
disabling its ability to suppress the expression of the cyclindependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1 (24). Importantly, recent
clinical trials of colon and prostate cancer, two malignancies with
known Myc involvement (e.g., ref. 11), have shown remarkable
efficacy of DFMO as a chemoprevention agent (25, 26). Here, we
tested the hypothesis that targeting Odc would also show efficacy
in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma and report that DFMO, but not
Odc heterozygosity, impairs the proliferative response of N-Myc
and delays tumor incidence and onset. Interestingly, targeting Odc
in this context affects the expression of a second arbiter of the
proliferative response of Myc, the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1. Thus,
targeting Odc disables Myc-induced tumorigenesis via distinct
effectors, depending upon tumor type, yet this typically involves
Cdk inhibitors that disable the proliferative response of Myc.

Materials and Methods
Array analyses. The GSE3960 Series Matrix File was downloaded from
National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus
database. This file summarizes the expression profiles of 101 primary
human neuroblastoma using Affymetrix U95Av2 arrays (27). Z scores were
used in GeneSpring 7.3 (GS) for hierarchical clustering and visualization of
microarray data. Z scores were calculated by subtracting the average gene
signal in all arrays from the signal for each gene and dividing the result by
the SD of all measured signals. Pearson correlation similarity measures and
average linkage clustering algorithms were used in GS for hierarchical
clustering of samples, which segregated the two major tumor groups. GS
was also used for Student’s t test between the two tumor groups. Genes with
P values of <0.05 were identified as those that were significantly
differentially expressed between the two tumor groups.
RNA preparation and analyses. Tumors were collected from TH-MYCN
mice (9) at the time of sacrifice and were snap frozen. An aliquot of each
tumor was homogenized. RNA from tumor samples and cultured cells was
prepared using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) and 1 Ag of RNA were used to prepare cDNA for quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was performed with the iTaq SYBRGreen kit and
an iCycler machine (Bio-Rad). Data analyses were performed with the DDCt
method, wherein ubiquitin served as the internal control.
To assess potential effects of DFMO on the turnover of p21Cip1 mRNA in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, IMR-32 and CHP-134 cells were either
mock-treated or DFMO-treated for 3 d. Actinomycin D (10 Ag/mL) was then
added, cells were harvested at specific intervals, RNA was isolated, and
p21Cip1 mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR. Expression was
standardized to the expression of ubiquitin; experiments were performed
in duplicate.
Western blot analyses. Cell culture lysates and homogenized tumor
aliquots from TH-MYCN mice were disrupted in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2.5 mmol/L EGTA, and
0.1% Tween 20 with 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L NaVO4, and complete mini
tablet protease inhibitor (Roche)] by sonication, as described (24). For
analyses of p21Cip1 levels in neuroblastoma cell lines, nuclear extracts were
prepared, as described by Andrews and Faller (28). Protein (40–50 Ag/lane)
was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and blotted for antibodies
specific for N-Myc (OP13, Calbiochem), ODC ( from Dr. Lisa Shantz,
Pennsylvania State University School of Medicine), p21Cip1 ( for mouse,
sc-6246, Santa Cruz; for human, sc-397, Santa Cruz), p27Kip1 (610242, BD
Transduction Labs), p53 ( for mouse, 1C12, Cell Signaling; for human, sc-6243,
Santa Cruz), actin (AC-15, Sigma), and a-tubulin (B-5-1-2, Sigma).
Cell culture. Human neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-MC, SK-N-SH, IMR32, and CHP-134 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) with 10%

Results
MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas express elevated levels of
ODC. High-risk, stage IV neuroblastoma is often accompanied by
MYCN amplification (3, 4). To initially canvass the potential
relationships of amplified MYCN in neuroblastoma with the
polyamine pathway, we performed hierarchical clustering of
microarray data of 101 primary human neuroblastomas from Gene
Expression Omnibus Series GSE3960, wherein f20% of the tumors
are MYCN-amplified (27). Several polyamine biosynthetic genes
were up-regulated in MYCN-amplified versus non–MYCN-amplified
tumors, including ODC, AMD1 (S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase), SMS (spermidine synthase), and SRM (spermine synthase;
Fig. 1A). In addition, there were significantly reduced levels of the
ODC antagonist antizyme 2 (OAZ2) in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, whereas other components of the pathway were not
significantly different between the two tumor cohorts (Fig. 1A).
Collectively, these data suggest an increase in polyamine pools in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.
The expression of the entire polyamine pathway was also
interrogated in the SK-N-MC, SK-N-SH, IMR-32, and CHP-134
human neuroblastoma cell lines. SK-N-MC and SK-N-SH are non–
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, whereas IMR-32 and CHP134 contain 25 and 100 copies of the MYCN gene per cell,
respectively (30). qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed
that IMR-32 and CHP-134 cells expressed much higher levels of
MYCN RNA and protein than SK-N-MC and SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 1B
and C). The levels of ODC were also increased in the MYCNamplified cell lines, IMR-32 (1.8-fold) and CHP-134 (2.2-fold),
compared with SK-N-MC (1.0-fold) and SK-N-SH cells (1.2-fold;
Fig. 1B). Similarly, ODC protein levels were elevated in the MYCNamplified versus non–MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines
(Fig. 1C). Therefore, ODC expression is selectively elevated in

was elevated in the MYCN-amplified lines (Fig. 1B), the expression
of others that were significantly different in primary neuroblastoma
were either unchanged between the two cell line cohorts (e.g.,
AMD1 and SSAT) or were regulated in an inverse fashion (e.g., SRM
and OAZ2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the expression of the
ODC and SMS polyamine biosynthetic enzymes pathway are
concordant between MYCN-amplified primary neuroblastoma and
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines.
DFMO selectively impairs the proliferation of MYCNamplified neuroblastoma. The increased levels of ODC in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines suggested that inhibiting ODC might selectively
affect neuroblastoma with MYCN involvement. To test this notion,
we initially assessed the effects of DFMO, an agent that was
originally developed as a suicide inhibitor of the active ODC dimer
(19), on the growth and/or survival of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. DFMO had no appreciable effects on the survival of any
of the four neuroblastoma cell lines (data not shown). By contrast,
DFMO had selective effects on the proliferation of MYCN-amplified
versus non–MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines (Fig. 2A).
Here, there were marked increases in the percentages of IMR-32
and CHP134 cells in G1 and corresponding reductions in the
percentage of these cells in S phase (Fig. 2A and Supplementary

enzyme activity in vivo and leads to marked reductions in
putrescine and spermidine pools (24). These mice were then
followed for neuroblastoma development and compared with the
control transgenic cohort that received normal drinking water. As
expected (31), 74% (20 of 27) of untreated TH-MYCN mice
developed neuroblastoma by 1 year of age. By contrast, only 48%
(12 of 25) of TH-MYCN mice receiving DFMO-drinking water
developed neuroblastoma by 1 year of age (Fig. 3A). Furthermore,
DFMO also delayed disease, wherein the median survival of the
DFMO-treated cohort that developed neuroblastoma was 139 days
and that of the untreated cohort was 84 days (Fig. 3A). Therefore,
DFMO delays both the onset and the incidence of neuroblastoma.
In EA-Myc transgenics, continuous DFMO treatment is required
to prevent lymphoma development, and when treated transgenics
are deprived of the drug, they develop lymphoma with kinetics
nearly identical to that of untreated EA-Myc mice (24). To address
whether this was also the case for MYCN-driven neuroblastoma,
a cohort of TH-MYCN mice received DFMO-treated water from
3 weeks of age until they were 120 days old, at which time they
were then withdrawn from the drug. Surprisingly, only 38% (8 of 21)
of this cohort of mice succumbed to disease (Fig. 3A). Thus, only
transient exposure to DFMO is needed for chemoprevention, a
finding which suggests that Odc activity is only required early
during neuroblastoma development.
To test if Odc heterozygosity would similarly impair neuroblastoma development, we backcrossed Odc +/ mice on to a
129x1/SvJ background until they were f94% 129x1/SvJ, and these
mice were then crossed to TH-MYCN mice (129x1/SvJ) to
generate TH-MYCN;Odc +/+ and TH-MYCN; Odc +/ littermates
(f97% 129x1/SvJ), which were followed for 1 year for neuroblastoma development. On this mixed background, incidence of
disease was reduced to 54% (22 of 41) for the TH-MYCN;Odc +/+
cohort. In this context, Odc heterozygosity did not significantly
affect disease incidence (P = 0.6241), wherein 44% (16 of 36) of
TH-MYCN;Odc +/ mice developed neuroblastoma (Fig. 3B).
Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the median
survival between the two cohorts (Fig. 3B). Therefore, Odc
heterozygosity is not sufficient to prevent Myc-driven cancer in
this context. However, the reductions in penetrance of neuroblastoma from 74% on a pure 129x1/SvJ background (Fig. 3A),
where disease penetrance and severity is most manifested (9), to
that observed for TH-MYCN;Odc +/+ mice (54% penetrance;
Fig. 3B) could potentially mask modest effects of Odc heterozygosity on N-Myc–driven tumorigenesis.
DFMO targets p21Cip1 to impair the growth of MYCNamplified neuroblastoma. In EA-Myc B cells, targeting Odc
disables Myc-mediated suppression of p27Kip1 (24). We, therefore,
tested whether DFMO-induced growth arrest in MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cells was also specifically associated with increased
levels of p27KIP1. As expected, there were no effects of DFMO on the
expression of N-MYC protein or ODC in MYCN -amplified
neuroblastoma, but surprisingly, there were also no effects of
DFMO on p27KIP1 mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 4A and B). Myc also
suppresses the transcription of the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1 (32, 33);
thus, we tested whether DFMO disables this response in MYCNamplified neuroblastoma. Indeed, qRT-PCR and Western blot
analyses established that DFMO induced marked and selective
increases in p21CIP1 mRNA levels in the IMR-32 and CHP-134
MYCN-amplified cell lines (Fig. 4A). p21CIP1 is a known transcription target of p53 (34) but p21CIP1 induction by DFMO was not
associated with increased levels of p53 (Fig. 4B), which is wild type

Fig. S3). By contrast, DFMO had only modest effects on the
proliferation of SK-N-MC cells and had no effect on the growth of
SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3). Accordingly,
growth curve experiments F DFMO showed that DFMO treatment
effectively abolished the growth of MYCN-amplified IMR-32 and
CHP-134 neuroblastoma cells but had more modest effects on the
rates of cell growth of SK-N-MC cells and none whatsoever on SKN-SH cells (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the growth of MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cells is dependent upon ODC.
DFMO, but not Odc heterozygosity, impairs N-Myc–driven
neuroblastoma. In EA-Myc transgenic mice, either DFMO or Odc
heterozygosity impairs the proliferative response of c-Myc in B cells
and markedly delays lymphomagenesis (24). Given the selective
effects of DFMO on the proliferation of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, we reasoned that similar responses would be
manifest in the rat tyrosine hydroxylase promoter-driven TH-MYCN
transgenic model, which overexpress N-Myc in the sympathetic
nervous tissue derived from the neural crest and which develop
neuroblastoma with f70% penetrance. Notably, hemizygous THMYCN mice develop tumors that are histologically similar to those
arising in pediatric stage IV, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma,
including syntenic gain and loss of chromosomes (9). Beginning
at 3 weeks of age, these transgenic mice were treated with 1%
DFMO in their drinking water, a dose that effectively blocks Odc

DFMO Impairs Neuroblastoma Development

in this cast of neuroblastoma cells (35).1 However, the induction of
p21CIP1 mRNA by DFMO did seem to be due to effects on
transcription, as DFMO had no effects on the t 1/2 of p21CIP1 mRNA
in actinomycin-D experiments, which measured their turnover
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Importantly, the induction of p21CIP1 by
DFMO was also manifested at the protein level, wherein there were
selective increases in p21CIP1 protein in DFMO-treated IMR-32 and
CHP-134 MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the
selective effects of DFMO in impairing the proliferative response of
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma are associated with increases in
p21CIP1 expression.
DFMO targets p21Cip1 in TH-MYCN neuroblastoma. The
findings that DFMO selectively targeted p21CIP1 in human
neuroblastoma suggested that this pathway would also be involved
and targeted in vivo in neuroblastoma arising in TH-MYCN
transgenics. One prediction was that p21Cip1 expression would be
generally suppressed in such TH-MYCN tumors. Indeed, only 3 of
11 neuroblastomas from TH-MYCN transgenics showed detectable
levels of p21Cip1 protein (Fig. 5A). In contrast, nearly all
neuroblastoma expressed p27Kip1 (Fig. 5A) and again in contrast
to Myc-driven lymphomas where p27Kip1 protein levels are
suppressed (24). Therefore, p21Cip1 expression is suppressed in
N-Myc–driven neuroblastoma.
A second prediction was that DFMO treatment would selectively
affect p21Cip1 expression in the delayed-onset tumors that
eventually arose in the DFMO-treated cohort of TH-MYCN mice.
Indeed, levels of p21Cip1 mRNA and protein were higher in most
DFMO-treated tumors compared with the untreated cohort
(Fig. 5A and B). Therefore, DFMO also induces the expression of
p21Cip1 in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma in vivo. In contrast, levels
of MYCN RNA and protein and of p27Kip1 were unaffected by
DFMO (Fig. 5A and B).
ODC amplification has been described as a mechanism of DFMO
resistance (36); thus, we also assessed whether Odc was induced
in the DFMO-treated cohort. Indeed, there were marked increases
in Odc protein in the DFMO-treated cohort of neuroblastoma
(Fig. 5A). However, the Odc gene was not amplified in these tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S5) and levels of Odc transcripts were similar
between the two cohorts (Fig. 5B). Therefore, up-regulation of Odc
in the DFMO-treated cohort seems due to either alterations in Odc
translation or turnover.

Discussion
Myc oncoproteins augment the rate of cell proliferation (37),
and in EA-Myc transgenic mice this response is limiting for tumor
onset and survival. Specifically, in B cells enforced c-Myc
expression increases the number of cells in cycle by repressing
p27Kip1 protein levels, and this occurs through the Myc-mediated
regulation of E2f1 and Cks1, which together are required for
activating the SCFSKP2 complex that targets p27Kip1 for destruction by the proteasome (38, 39). Accordingly, loss of p27Kip1
accelerates rates of Myc-induced lymphoma development (40),
whereas loss of either E2f1 or Cks1 compromises Myc’s
proliferative response, suppression of p27Kip1, and onset and
incidence of Myc-drive lymphoma (38, 39). Quite strikingly, the
Myc-to-p27Kip1 pathway is also controlled by the polyamine
pathway, wherein Odc expression is greatly elevated in EA-Myc B

cells and targeting Odc with DFMO or Odc heterozygosity blocks
the ability of Myc to repress p27Kip1 (24).
The findings presented herein show some parallels of targeting
Odc in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma compared with Mycoverexpressing B cells. Specifically, akin to Myc-driven B-cell
lymphomas of mice and man, ODC is also overexpressed in
stage IV, MYCN-amplified pediatric neuroblastoma, findings
consistent with ODC being a direct transcription target of Myc
oncoproteins (16, 17). Furthermore, DFMO also selectively
cancels the proliferative response of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and dramatically impairs the onset and incidence of NMyc–driven neuroblastoma in vivo. However, interesting and

lymphoma (24) whereas only ODC and spermidine synthase are
increased in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma (Fig. 1A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S2). Finally, in neural crest progenitors, there
may be no substantial effects of loss of one Odc allele on overall
levels of Odc protein, on Odc enzyme activity, and/or on
polyamine pools.
Loss of the neurofibromatosis-1 (Nf1) or retinoblastoma (Rb)
tumor suppressors accelerates disease in TH-MYCN mice (9). These
studies are consistent with apparent alterations of NF1 in pediatric
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma (42, 43) and with the reduced
expression of p21Cip1 in most TH-MYCN neuroblastomas (Fig. 5),
which express hyperphosphorylated (i.e., inactive) pRb (data not
shown). They are also consistent with reduced p21CIP1 expression
in MYCN-amplified versus nonamplified human neuroblastoma
(P < 0.005, Gene Expression Omnibus Series GSE3960; data not
shown). They also underscore the unique genetics of this peculiar
malignancy versus those driven by Myc in other scenarios, wherein
there seems to be little to no contribution of p21Cip1 on tumor
development (40). Finally, these findings support the interesting
notion that Myc activation in different tumor types selects for the
inactivation of distinct tumor suppressor pathways, which
contribute to malignant progression.
The mechanisms by which targeting Odc induces the p27Kip1
and p21Cip1 inhibitors to impair the proliferative response of Myc
in lymphoma versus neuroblastoma, respectively, are not fully
understood. In B cells, targeting Odc disables the ability of Myc to
trigger p27Kip1 protein degradation, and here, effects appear via
Cks1,2 which is induced by Myc and is a required component of
the SCFSkp2 complex that directs p27Kip1 destruction (39, 44). By
contrast, in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma there are elevated
levels of ODC and low levels of p21CIP1 mRNA and protein, and
DFMO seems to cancel the ability of N-Myc to repress p21Cip1
transcription, both ex vivo and in vivo. We propose that MYCNamplified cells are, similar to Myc-expressing B cells, ‘‘addicted’’ to
ODC for their proliferative response and that, in neuroblastoma,
this hinges upon proper regulation of p21CIP1 . Furthermore, we
suspect that the effects of DFMO on p21Cip1 expression that have
been observed in some tumor cell lines (45, 46) reflect Myc
involvement in the tumors from which they were derived, which
renders these cells addicted to ODC. How DFMO may affect
p21CIP1 transcription in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma is not yet
clear. However, because this response seems to be p53independent and does not involve changes in the t 1/2 of p21CIP1
mRNA, we hypothesize that DFMO somehow interferes with Mycmediated transcriptional repression of p21CIP1 , which occurs by
binding of Myc to Miz-1 (32).
The findings that DFMO is an effective prevention agent in
neuroblastoma were quite surprising, because the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter driving the MYCN transgene is active from the
genesis of the neural crest early in development. Thus, one would
predict more benefit if DFMO was given earlier in life. However,
DFMO cannot be given during gestation, where this drug or total
loss of Odc causes early embryonic lethality (37, 47), nor after birth,
as there are side effects on neuronal development (48). Thus, there
are valid concerns whether DFMO could be given in a safe manner
to pediatric patients suffering from stage IV MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma. Nonetheless, with the low doses of DFMO that

elevated levels of p21Cip1. A, Western blot analysis of MYCN, ODC, p21Cip1,
p27Kip1, and tubulin levels in individual neuroblastoma arising in untreated or
DFMO-treated TH-MYCN transgenic mice. B, qRT-PCR analysis comparing the
levels of MYCN, ODC, p21Cip1 , and p27Kip1 mRNAs in neuroblastoma that arose
in either untreated (H2O) or DFMO-treated TH-MYCN transgenic mice. The
relative expression in individual tumor samples is indicated by the individual
marks (circle, untreated; squares, DFMO-treated) on the scatter blot, and the
average relative expression for the group is indicated by the bar. The average
relative expression level of each gene is set at 1.0 for the untreated group, and
levels of mRNA are standardized to the expression of ubiquitin, which is not
regulated by N-Myc. qRT-PCR analysis shows that the expression of other genes
in the polyamine pathway was unaffected in the DFMO-treated cohort of
neuroblastoma (Supplementary Fig. S6).

context-specific differences are also evident, wherein DFMO
effects on the proliferative response driven by N-Myc are linked
to effects on p21Cip1 in both human and mouse neuroblastoma
and only transient treatment with DFMO is necessary to achieve
chemoprevention. Furthermore, Odc heterozygosity has no effect
on tumorigenesis in this tumor model, whereas in EA-Myc
transgenics and in carcinogen-driven papillomas, Odc heterozygosity has marked effects on tumor onset, incidence, and overall
survival (24, 41). Cell type and/or tumor context-specific control
of polyamine homeostasis could account for these differences
and allow neural crest progenitors to overcome effects of
reductions in Odc. Indeed, polyamine homeostasis is different
between Myc-driven lymphoma and neuroblastoma, as all of the
biosynthetic enzymes are up-regulated in Myc-induced B-cell

have been given in the colon and prostate cancer chemoprevention
trials, wherein there were no noticeable side effects (25, 26), it may
be wise to revisit this issue for stage IV neuroblastoma because
transient treatment with DFMO here is also sufficient to provide
chemoprevention and especially because it may show benefit for
this otherwise lethal malignancy. Notably, recent findings that ODC
overexpression is a superior indicator of poor prognosis in
neuroblastoma (49) suggests that even those patients lacking
MYCN amplicons but overexpressing ODC may experience benefit
from DFMO treatment. Regardless, our studies do suggest that
targeting the polyamine pathway should perhaps be considered in
combination with more conventional agents to treat this
devastating disease.
