BACKGROUND: Objective, treatment-independent markers of cancer-related fatigue are needed to advance clinical trials. In the current study, the authors evaluated physical, neurocognitive, and serologic markers for correlation with self-reported fatigue before and
after (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: Women with AJCC TNM Stage I-III breast
cancer consented to assessment before and after the completion of 4 cycles of dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Assessment included self-reported fatigue (using the Brief Fatigue Inventory), depression (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–
Depression Scale [CES-D]), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 28 objective measures (grip strength in dominant and nondominant
hands, 6-minute walk, daily total energy expenditure, 14 neurocognitive tests, and 10 serologic markers). Generalized linear regression
models of fatigue were constructed (1 model per marker), and adjusted for depression, timing before/after chemotherapy, menopausal status, obesity, and educational level. P values were adjusted to control the False Discovery Rate. RESULTS: Of 28 subjects, 3 withdrew without completing baseline assessments. Prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy data were available for the evaluation of
physical measures (25 subjects aged 50.6 6 9.5 years), neurocognitive tests (22 subjects), and serologic markers (10 subjects). On
covariate-adjusted analysis, interleukin (IL)-12 was found to be associated with fatigue at both assessments (P<.01). Serum eotaxin
(P <.01), IL-1RA (P <.01), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) (P<.01), and performance on 2 neurocognitive (Trail Making)
tests (P<.01 and P 5.02, respectively) were found to be inversely associated with fatigue before chemotherapy but not afterward,
whereas daily energy expenditure, serum MCP-1, and serum macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP-1a) were found to be associated with fatigue after receipt of chemotherapy but not before (P<.01 for each). The association between energy expenditure and fatigue was detectable only if an actively athletic subject with outlier values of energy expenditure was excluded. CONCLUSIONS:
Serum IL-12 merits confirmatory testing as an objective, treatment-independent measure of fatigue in patients with early-stage breast

INTRODUCTION
Fatigue is consistently one of the most common symptoms reported by patients undergoing cancer treatment. It may develop early in the course of therapy, and may persist for months afterward.1,2 By definition, “cancer-related fatigue (CRF)
is a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning.”3 In patients with
cancer, several factors contribute to CRF, including the underlying disease, comorbid symptoms, and medical conditions,
as well as treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fatigue is seldom an isolated symptom, but generally is a component of a symptom complex that may include depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders.4 The ability to study and conduct interventional trials to decrease CRF has been compromised by the complexity of the problem as well as the lack of
an objective measurement of what is primarily a subjective symptom.5

Tools such as the 6-minute walk, accelerometers,
and hand grip have been used by pulmonologists and geriatricians to provide objective information that may distinguish functional age from chronologic age.68
Neurocognitive tests also may provide an objective assessment of psychomotor processing time, reaction time,
and executive functioning.9,10 Women undergoing (neo)
adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer often
report fatigue, and that symptom may have both physical
and cognitive components.11
In the current study, we undertook a clinical trial to
assess and identify objective measurements of physical
and cognitive fatigue. A battery of validated measures
were performed before and after 4 cycles of (neo) adjuvant
chemotherapy and compared with patient-reported fatigue as assessed by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). Approximately one-half of the participants had blood
obtained for the assessment of cytokines. The results of
that clinical trial are reported herein.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients from the outpatient medical oncology clinics at
the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in
Duarte, California were recruited to participate in a clinical trial regarding CRF in patients with breast cancer.
Women with newly diagnosed, AJCC TNM Stage I-III
invasive ductal breast cancer were eligible if they had an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0 to 2, were aged > 18 years, were not being treated

with daily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and
were to receive the chemotherapy regimen of dose-dense
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the City of
Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center. Each participant
provided an informed consent form before participation
in the current study.
The study design is summarized in Table 1. The repeated assessments included 3 self-reported (fatigue [Brief
Fatigue Inventory (BFI)], depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D)], and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) and 28 objective
measures (4 physical markers [grip strength in dominant
and nondominant hands, a 6-minute walk test, and daily
total energy expenditure (averaged over 1 week)], 14
examiner-administered neurocognitive tests [grooved pegboard in dominant and nondominant hands, digit symbol
coding and symbol search (Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale [WAIS] -4th edition), 2 Trail Making tests (parts A
and B), and 4 color-word interference and 4 verbal fluency tests (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [DKEFS])], and 10 serologic markers [eotaxin, granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-1RA, interferon-inducible protein
10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a, MIP-1b, and
RANTES]).
The tools used to assess both physical and cognitive
function, in addition to the patient’s quality of life, are
summarized below.
Quality of Life Measures
Brief Fatigue Inventory

The BFI is a 9-item questionnaire that addresses the impact of fatigue on daily function. The items are scored on
a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no
fatigue or does not interfere with activity/work and 10 indicating bad fatigue or completely interferes with activity/
work. The tool was developed specifically for the assessment of fatigue in patients with cancer.12
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index

The PSQI is a 19-item index that measures subjective
sleep quality grouped into 7 component scores: sleep
quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and
daytime dysfunction. A global PSQI score also can be
scored. The PSQI has demonstrated internal consistency,
with an overall reliability coefficient of 0.83. The index

have supported its high validity and reliability.13

tive battery was approximately 40 minutes. Tests were
completed in the following order.

Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression
Scale

Conners’ Continuous Performance Test II
(Version 5)

The CES-D is a 20-item, self-report scale that was originally developed to measure depressive symptoms in the
general population and has been used to screen for depression in samples of medically ill individuals. Responses are
rated on a 4-point scale, and the total score ranges from 0
to 60. Scores of  16 are indicators of clinical
depression.14

The Conners’ Continuous Performance Test II (Conners’
CPT II; version 5) is a neuropsychological task that has
repeatedly been shown to differentiate individuals with
attention deficit from normal groups. The standard protocol of the Conners’ CPT II computerized test uses a
short practice exercise before administration of the full
test to ensure that the respondent fully understands the
task before proceeding. After the practice exercise, a new
administration of the Conners’ CPT is initiated that is 14
minutes long. Conners’ CPT II respondents are required
to press the space bar or click the mouse whenever any letter except the letter “X” appears on the computer screen.
Several variables may be derived from the Conners’
CPT II, including errors of omission and commission,
mean hit reaction time, standard error of the mean hit reaction time, d’, and beta. Overall performance on the 2
signal detection measures, d’ and beta, as well as increased
variability in reaction time over time, are reported to have
the strongest relationship to attention symptoms. The
program is commonly used as a screening tool to identify
potential attention problems, and as an aid in monitoring
treatment effectiveness. The Conners’ CPT II has been
used in prior research to determine whether there has
been improvement or deterioration with changes in
medication.

Physical Assessments
Body Mass Index

The patients’ body mass index was determined as weight
in kg/height in m2.
Activity Monitor BodyBugg

The BodyBugg (BodyMedia, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is
a monitor worn on the back of the upper right arm (the
tricep) against the skin and underneath clothing. The
monitor measures the wearer’s caloric expenditure
through information gathered by 4 sensors: a galvanic
skin response sensor, heat flux sensor, thermistor-based
sensor, and 3-dimensional accelerometer.15 Women were
asked to wear the BodyBugg all day in conjunction with
recording daily activity logs for 7 pretreatment days (within a 2-week window before the initiation of chemotherapy
with AC) and for 7 posttreatment days (within days 8-14
after cycle 4 of AC chemotherapy). The total energy expenditure was recorded as the average over 1 week. The
validation of this testing has been reported elsewhere.16
Six-minute walk

Patients were instructed to wear comfortable shoes and
were asked to walk as quickly as possible for 6 minutes.
This test occurred in a marked (premeasured) hallway
within the breast clinic. The distance walked during those
6 minutes was calculated.
Hand grip

Grip strength was recorded using a hand grip dynamometer in both the dominant and nondominant hand.
Patients were instructed to squeeze the device as hard as
they could. Each hand was tested 3 times, and the highest
score was recorded in kilograms.8
Neurocognitive Testing

Each participant was tested by a single trained individual
(S.W.). The total time for completion for the neurocogni1812

WAIS Digit Symbol Coding

WAIS Digit Symbol Coding is a symbol substitution task
which requires the subject to copy symbols that are paired
with numbers for 2 minutes. This test is a psychomotor
performance test, requiring motor persistence, sustained
attention, processing speed, and visuomotor coordination. The average test-retest reliability coefficient is 0.84,
with an average alpha of .81. This test is one of the several
cognitive subsets comprising the 4th edition of the WAIS.
The standardization sample consists of 2450 individuals
stratified for sex, race, and geographic region consistent
with the percentages of those variables in the most recent
US census.9
Trail Making Test Parts A and B

The Trail Making Test part A is a timed paper-and-pencil
task requiring the patient to connect encircled numbers
randomly arranged on a page as quickly as possible without errors. It requires both attention skills and

information processing speed. Part B is a more challenging timed task, requiring the patient to sequentially alternate between 2 mental sets (letters and numbers). It
requires set shifting, processing speed, working memory,
and cognitive flexibility. On average, Part A has a testretest reliability coefficient of 0.79 and Part B has a testretest reliability coefficient of 0.89.17
Grooved Pegboard

The grooved pegboard is a widely used test with which to
assess fine motor coordination and dexterity. It consists of
a small board containing a set of slotted holes angled in
different directions. Each peg has a ridge along one side,
requiring it to be rotated into position for correct insertion. The score is time to completion. Test-retest reliability has been found to be substantial (reliability coefficient
of  0.82) with no consistent practice effects.18
The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS)

The D-KEFS is a neurocognitive battery, consisting of
several tests and sub-tests which measure a wide spectrum
of verbal and nonverbal executive functions. Each test is
designed to be a stand-alone instrument that can be administered individually or along with other D-KEFS tests.
The D-KEFS was standardized on a stratified sample of
1,750 individuals of varying age ranges. Two D-KEFS
subtests are recommended as part of the neurocognitive
battery: the Color-Word Interference Test and the Verbal
Cancer

Covariates taken into account in each model were depression; menopausal status (perimenopausal vs premenopausal or postmenopausal), timing of assessment, and their interaction; and obesity, education (college vs less or unknown), and their interaction.
b
P values were adjusted to control the False Discovery Rate. Values significant at False Discovery Rate-adjusted P<.05 are shown in bold type.
c
One subject was a 36-year-old athlete who continued to train vigorously throughout the study and had outlier values for TEE both before and after
chemotherapy.
d
Before chemotherapy, a single subject exceeded the time limit for this neurocognitive test; her missing score was replaced with the lowest score possible (z
score of -3.00).

linear regression models of fatigue (1 model per objective
marker) were constructed using generalized estimating
equations with an independent correlation matrix. All models were adjusted for the following covariates: depression
score centered on the mean of all values; menopausal status,
timing of assessment (prechemotherapy or postchemotherapy), and their interaction; and obesity, college education,
and their interaction. Due to the large number of hypotheses (28 objective markers, each before and after chemotherapy), the False Discovery Rate was controlled using the linear
step-up method of Benjamini and Hochberg.19
1814

RESULTS
Of the 28 enrolled subjects, 3 were nonevaluable because
they withdrew before the first week of the study. The baseline characteristics of the remaining subjects (age 50.3 6
9.5 years) are summarized in Table 2. The median CESD score was slightly elevated at 12 (range, 1-42), and the
median PSQI of 6 is indicative of poor sleep quality.13
Preparatory to evaluating candidate markers for fatigue, a model of BFI was constructed to identify the covariates needing to be controlled in the main analysis. As
shown in Table 3, the following covariates were identified:

depression (CES-D), status pre- or post-chemotherapy,
menopausal status, obesity, and college education.
According to covariate-adjusted analysis (Table 4),
serum eotaxin (P < .01), IL-1RA (P < .01), MCP-1
(P < .01), and performance on 2 neurocognitive (Trail
Making) tests (P < .01 and P 5 .02, respectively) were
found to be inversely associated with fatigue before chemotherapy but not afterward. Daily energy expenditure,
serum MCP-1, and serum MIP-1a were found to be significantly associated with fatigue after chemotherapy but
not before. The association between energy expenditure
and fatigue was detectable only if the athletic subject with
outlier values of energy expenditure was excluded. IL-12
was the only marker that correlated significantly with fatigue both before and after chemotherapy.
DISCUSSION
A scientific research committee within the National Comprehensive Cancer Network concluded that progress in
the study of CRF is compromised by the lack of clinical
measures and the consistent use of self-report questionnaires; the results of which may vary throughout the day.5
We undertook the current prospective pilot study to identify an objective marker of self-reported CRF. Participants
were tested 7 to 10 days before the initiation of chemotherapy and 7 to 10 days after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy, a time that would reflect their hematologic and
functional nadir. All subjects had recently been diagnosed
with breast cancer, and the impact of their diagnosis may
have contributed to the relatively high CES-D scores and
poor sleep quality at baseline.
Many of the assessments we performed correlated
with self-reported fatigue using the BFI. It is interesting to
note that none of the physical measurements (energy expenditure, hand grip, 6-minute walk) were found to be
consistently associated with fatigue before and after chemotherapy. This finding raises the possibility that, at least
in patients with early-stage breast cancer, CRF does not
resemble common fatigue. Also worthy of comment is the
lack of a consistent association between fatigue and neurocognitive tests.
Only the cytokine IL-12 correlated with fatigue
both before and after chemotherapy. Changes in inflammatory markers have been reported in conjunction with
CRF before, during, and after treatment.20 The contribution of immune signaling to CRF is intriguing and complex. Several factors contribute to increases in cytokines,
including treatment, obesity, and depression. In the
current study, obesity was found to be associated with fatigue, except in college-educated individuals. To our

knowledge, it is unclear whether cytokine changes are a
marker of other biologic processes, or contribute to the
symptom of fatigue. It is of interest that we observed the
greatest increase in fatigue among those participants who
were perimenopausal at the time of diagnosis. Although
the majority of breast cancer is diagnosed among postmenopausal women, younger women who undergo
chemotherapy are at risk of experiencing premature menopause and its associated endocrine changes, which contribute to fatigue. The impact of endocrine changes on
fatigue could not be assessed in this small sample.
Much of the data concerning CRF in breast cancer
survivorship is derived from population-based, rather
than prospective studies. A strength of the current study is
that all patients were enrolled and tested prospectively.
Because CRF is influenced by several factors, such as type
of treatment, depression, sleep problems, hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal function, neurotransmitters, and skeletal
muscle and fitness, as well as psychological factors, welldesigned prospective clinical trials should control for as
many of these risk factors as possible.4,20-23
The current study was limited by the small number
of participants (especially in the analysis of serologic
markers) and the many factors that contribute to CRF. In
addition, only the BFI was used to determine the patients’
report of fatigue. Nonetheless, the assessment of IL-12
warrants further investigation in other populations of
patients undergoing different treatment modalities and
different chemotherapy regimens.
