BACKGROUND. The prognosis of patients with plasma cell leukemia (PCL), an
aggressive variant of multiple myeloma (MM), is usually poor. Bortezomib is the
first proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced MM. Currently
available information regarding the role of bortezomib in PCL is scanty and
derives from anecdotal, single–case reports.

METHODS. The authors conducted a retrospective survey of unselected Italian
patients with primary or secondary PCL who were treated with bortezomib outside of clinical trials. Twelve evaluable patients were recorded who had received
bortezomib for 1 to 6 cycles as either a single agent or variously combined with
other drugs. Three patients were treated with bortezomib as frontline therapy,
and 9 patients received bortezomib after 1 to 4 lines of chemotherapy, including
autologous stem cell transplantation and thalidomide.

We conducted a national retrospective survey of
unselected patients with a diagnosis of PCL according to the International uniform response criteria of
the International Myeloma Working Group who had
received bortezomib for the treatment of their disease outside of clinical trials.29 Eight hematologic
institutions participating in the Gruppo Italiano
Studio Mieloma Multiplo (GISMM), Gruppo Italiano
Studio Linfomi (GISL), and Gruppo Italiano Malattie
Ematologiche dell’Adulto (GIMEMA) cooperative
groups enrolled at least 1 patient each. No PCL
patient treated with bortezomib in these centers was
excluded from the analysis.
Twelve patients who were diagnosed between
October 2002, and August 2006 were evaluable (5
men and 7 women with a median age of 61.2 years
[range, 42–74 years]). Informed consent was obtained
to review the available clinical data in each case.
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the
patients, 8 of whom had primary PCL and 4 of
whom had secondary PCL. Nine patients had previously received 1 to 4 lines of chemotherapy before
treatment with bortezomib, including autologous
stem cell transplantation in 5 cases and thalidomide
in 5 cases. Three patients received bortezomib as
frontline therapy.

without previous evidence of MM, whereas secondary PCL (which accounts for the remaining 40% of
cases) consists of a leukemic transformation occurring in approximately 1% of patients with a previously diagnosed MM.
The prognosis of PCL patients who are treated
with standard chemotherapy is usually poor, with
median survival being measured in months.3–11 Stem
cell transplantation may be more effective in some
but not all PCL patients.12–17
Bortezomib (Velcade) is the first proteasome inhibitor approved in the U.S. and European Union for
the treatment of resistant/recurrent MM and is currently under investigation as a frontline chemotherapy approach.18–20 Some reports have suggested that
bortezomib could be particularly effective in patients
with extramedullary MM.21–24 However, to our
knowledge, to date there are very few data regarding
the efficacy of this drug in PCL.25–28
In the current study, we evaluated the therapeutic role of bortezomib in a retrospective, multicenter
series of 12 patients with PCL who received this drug
as either frontline therapy or during the course of
their disease.

Dose reduction required.
§
Bortezomib was given at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2.

Circulating plasma cells ranged from 2 3 109/L
to 71 3 109/L. Three patients had varying degrees of
renal failure (serum creatinine levels of 1.55 mg/dL,
2.6 mg/dL, and 6.1 mg/dL, respectively), and 4
patients had extramedullary disease. A chromosome
13 deletion was observed in 4 of 7 patients with an
available karyotype.
In all but 1 patient, bortezomib was given using
the standard schedule of 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8,
and 11, with an interval of 10 to 12 days between 2
cycles. One patient was treated with a higher dose
(1.5 mg/m2) of bortezomib. Four patients received
bortezomib as single agent, and 8 patients received it
in combination with other drugs (Table 2). A median
of 4 cycles was administered (range, 1–6 cycles).
Responses were graded according to the recently
published International uniform response criteria30
as partial (PR) (defined as a reduction of >50% of
M-protein and a reduction in the 24–hour urinary
M-protein of >90% or to <200 mg per 24–hour period), very good partial (VGPR) (defined as serum
and urine M-protein levels detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or a 90% reduction in the serum M-protein level plus the urine
M-protein level of <100 mg per 24–hour period), and
complete (CR) (defined as negative immunofixation
on serum and urine, the disappearance of soft tissue
plasmacytomas, and bone marrow plasma cells of

<5%). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated beginning with the first
month of treatment with bortezomib.

RESULTS
Table 2 summarizes the results. Overall, there were 5
PRs, 4 VGPRs, and 2 CRs, for a response rate of 92%.
Plasma cells disappeared from the peripheral blood
in 10 patients. Serum creatinine levels improved or
returned to normal values in all patients who had
abnormal renal function noted at baseline.
Responses did not appear to be influenced by
the type or number of previous treatments or by
other clinical or biologic parameters, including chromosome 13 deletion or the use of bortezomib as single agent or in combination with other drugs.
However, it was interesting to note that the longest
response was achieved in a patient who had previously been treated with a combination of bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide and
who again received bortezomib in association with
doxorubicin and dexamethasone. In 3 patients, autologous stem cell transplantation procedures could be
initiated after the response was achieved.
Overall, the median PFS and OS were 8 months
and 12 months, respectively (Fig. 1A). The median
PFS and OS in patients with primary PCL had still

not been reached at 21 months (Fig. 1B). At the time
of last follow–up, 8 patients were alive 6 to 21
months after therapy with bortezomib (4 of whom
either in VGPR or CR) whereas 4 patients (including
the only nonresponder) had died of progressive disease after 3 to 12 months.
According to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 3), grade 3/4
hematologic toxicity (mainly thrombocytopenia)
occurred in 9 patients whereas reversible, grade 3
neuropathy was observed in only 1 patient (Table 2).
Fever of unknown origin or documented infections
(genitourinary tract, pneumonia, herpeszoster) were
reported to occur in 6 patients. Other toxicities
observed (diarrhea, nausea, skin rashes) never
reached grade 3 (Table 2). In 3 patients, a reduction
in the dose of bortezomib given was required due to
hematologic or neurologic toxicity.

DISCUSSION
PCL is an aggressive variant of MM characterized by
poor prognosis. The global response rate to standard
chemotherapy in patients with primary PCL was
reported to be 45% in 7 larger series including 136

patients.3,4,6–8,10,11 In these studies, the median OS
was only 7 months (Table 3). In particular, conflicting data have been reported regarding the use of the
combination of vincristine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and dexamethasone (VAD) or VAD-derived regimens.5,6,9,10 In view of such disappointing results,
autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation
are currently recommended for eligible patients with
primary PCL.2 Using these more intensive approaches, long–term survivals have been reported
occasionally.12–15 Indeed, the median OS was reported to be approximately 36 months (range, 1–
106 months) after autologous stem cell transplantation and approximately 20 months (range, 1–84
months) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation
in 38 evaluable patients with primary PCL recently
reviewed.16 However, even with these treatments,
results may be unsatisfactory.17
Among new drugs for the treatment of MM, thalidomide has been reported to be temporarily effective in a small group of patients with PCL.31–33 To
our knowledge, no data are currently available in the
literature regarding the use of lenalidomide in this
setting.
Secondary PCL often represents a terminal event
for patients with advanced MM, which is usually nonresponsive to any treatment modality and demonstrates a median survival of only 1 to 2 months.1–4,11
Bortezomib is a novel therapeutic agent with
proven efficacy for the treatment of MM.18–20 It is
interesting to note that some authors have suggested
that bortezomib could be particularly useful for the
treatment of MM patients with extramedullary disease.21–24 However, only sporadic, single–case reports
have been published to date regarding the use of

Bortezomib and Plasma Cell Leukemia/Musto et al.

bortezomib in the setting of PCL. The efficacy of this
drug, as a single agent or in sequence after other
combination chemotherapies, has been reported
both in primary PCL27 as well as in secondary PCL.26
Esparis-Ogando et al25 were the first to describe a
heavily pretreated patient with secondary PCL, severe
anemia, and thrombocytopenia in whom circulating
plasma cells disappeared and peripheral blood
counts returned to normal after treatment with bortezomib. Complete remission and successful stem
cell mobilization also have been reported in patients
with refractory PCL.28 However, this treatment needs
to be carefully monitored because tumor lysis syndrome may occur in PCL patients receiving bortezomib.34
The results of the current study, which is the first
performed in a relatively larger number of patients,
indicate that bortezomib is effective in inducing significant responses in patients with primary or secondary PCL. Toxicity was found to be acceptable and
some patients entered into high–quality remission
phases, allowing to start intensive therapeutic programs after bortezomib. It is interesting to note that
4 of 5 patients who developed disease recurrence after autologous stem cell transplantation achieved a
response, a finding that compares favorably with the
results obtained with other salvage treatments for
MM patients who undergo transplantation. We also
emphasize that survival after bortezomib therapy
was found to be longer than the entire OS previously
reported for patients with primary PCL who receive
standard chemotherapy (Table 3). This appears to be
of particular significance if we consider that the majority of patients in the current study were not treated at the time of diagnosis and that some had
developed disease recurrence after autologous stem
cell transplantation or had secondary PCL, the prognosis of which is particularly poor. However, as
expected, the best results were obtained in patients
with primary PCL (Fig. 1B).
The reasons for a possible particular sensitivity
of PCL to bortezomib remain speculative. Bortezomib reportedly reduces the in vitro growth of
leukemic plasma cells more efficiently than dexamethasone or doxorubicin.25 Treatment with bortezomib also favors PCL cell apoptosis, inducing
procaspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and decreasing the amount of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk1/2) and phospho-Erk1/2.25
The peculiar genetic and phenotypic characteristics
of circulating and extramedullary neoplastic plasma
cells35–37 could explain the sensitivity of these cells
to bortezomib, but this remains to be formerly
demonstrated.

2289

In conclusion, the findings of the current study
indicate that bortezomib is a useful agent for the
treatment of patients with PCL, which could significantly improve the otherwise expected poor clinical
outcome of these individuals. Therefore, we suggest
that bortezomib be considered and investigated further (particularly in combination with other drugs
and within transplantation programs) for the initial
treatment of these patients.
