Molecular Modulation of Estrogen-Induced Apoptosis by
Synthetic Progestins in Hormone Replacement Therapy:
An Insight into the Women's Health Initiative Study
Elizabeth E. Sweeney, Ping Fan, and V. Craig Jordan

Abstract
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used to manage menopausal symptoms in women and can be
comprised of an estrogen alone or an estrogen combined with a progestin. The Women's Health Initiative
demonstrated in their randomized trials that estrogen alone HRT decreases the risk of breast cancer in
postmenopausal women, whereas combined estrogen plus a progestin (medroxyprogesterone acetate, MPA)
HRT increases this risk. Long-term estrogen-deprived MCF-7:5C cells were used to model the postmenopausal
breast cancer cell environment. MPA is able to modify E2-induced apoptosis in MCF-7:5C cells. MPA, similar to
dexamethasone, increases glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcriptional activity, increases SGK1, a GR target gene,
and can be blocked by RU486 (an antiglucocorticoid), suggesting that it functions through the GR. Norethindrone
acetate (NETA), another progestin used in HRT, acts like an estrogen at high doses, upregulating estrogen
receptor target genes and generating apoptosis in MCF-7:5C cells. The data suggest that women taking HRT
comprising an estrogen plus MPA may have an increased risk of breast cancer due to MPA acting as a
glucocorticoid and blunting E2-induced apoptosis in this environment. Therefore, perhaps other approved
progestins (e.g., NETA) should be considered as alternatives to MPA. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7060–8. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) was introduced into
clinical practice in 1941 for the treatment of menopausal
symptoms and related conditions. Despite its widespread
use, there were concerns with unopposed estrogen therapy.
Reports (1, 2) of an increased risk of endometrial cancer in
women taking CEE resulted in package label warnings about
the risks of cancer and thrombosis. A solution was required
for the long-term use of CEE to treat osteoporosis in
postmenopausal women without risking endometrial cancer. Histologic examination of biopsies from women taking
CEE showed proliferation of the endometrial lining, but the
addition of a synthetic progestin prevented this action (3).
The FDA approved the use of a combination of an estrogen
and a synthetic progestin for the treatment and prevention
of osteoporosis in 1986. The combination of CEE and a
synthetic progestin, here medroxyprogesterone acetate
(MPA), is referred to as hormone replacement therapy
(HRT).

Observational clinical and laboratory studies supported the
view that HRT users had a reduced risk of coronary heart
disease and atherosclerosis (4, 5). These encouraging data led
to randomized clinical trials, the largest of which is the
Women's Health Initiative (WHI) comprising two parallel
studies that enrolled a total of 27,000 subjects. Women with
an intact uterus were randomized to placebo or HRT (CEE
0.625 mg and MPA 2.5 mg daily), and hysterectomized women
were randomized to placebo or CEE alone. The trial was
stopped when the HRT arm exceeded the predeﬁned safety
limit for the risk of breast cancer, as well as heart disease,
stroke, and blot clots (6). Unexpectedly, however, the CEE alone
group reported decreased breast cancer incidence and mortality after stopping this trial 18 months later for an increase in
strokes (7).
Laboratory studies over the past decade have documented
and deciphered a new biology of estrogen-induced apoptosis
that occurs in long-term estrogen-deprived breast cancer
cells (8, 9). These studies translate to beneﬁt in clinical trials
of estrogen therapy in antihormone-resistant breast cancer
(10, 11). The question becomes: if the molecular mechanism of
estrogen-induced apoptosis is deﬁned in well-documented
laboratory models of estrogen-deprived breast cancer cells
(12–14), why does a combination of MPA plus CEE in the WHI
increase the risk of breast cancer (15)? Although there is a large
body of experimental evidence that the female sex hormones
estrogen and progesterone are responsible for breast cancer
growth (16), the paradox that estrogen induces apoptosis in
estrogen-deprived breast cancer cells (10) has created a new
dimension in our understanding of physiologic estrogen action
in a woman's body.

Estrogen-Induced Apoptosis in Hormone Replacement Therapy

The central question to be addressed is whether a synthetic
progestin, MPA, can modulate estrogen-induced apoptosis and
cause breast cancer cell growth. Here, we demonstrate that
different synthetic progestins have different pharmacologic
actions that exert different selection pressures during longterm therapy in culture. We report for the ﬁrst time that the
glucocorticoid properties of MPA (17) are responsible for
blunting the apoptotic actions of estrogen, resulting in the
growth of a new breast cancer cell population that is better able
to survive.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MCF-7:5C and MCF-7:WS8 cell lines were cultured in phenol
red-free RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% charcoalstripped fetal bovine serum. Media and treatments were
replaced every 3 days. DNA ﬁngerprinting patterns of the cell
lines are consistent with the report by the ATCC (18). The MCF7:5C cell line was chosen for its representation of the estrogendeprived breast cancer cell and its ability to undergo estrogeninduced apoptosis; the MCF-7:WS8 cell line represents the
estrogen-fueled breast cancer cell environment. Estradiol (E2;
Sigma-Aldrich), dexamethasone (Dex; Sigma-Aldrich), MPA
(Sigma-Aldrich), norethindrone acetate (NETA; SigmaAldrich), R5020 (Sigma-Aldrich), RU486 (Sigma-Aldrich), 4hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; Sigma-Aldrich), ICI 182,780 (ICI;
Sigma-Aldrich), and combinations were dissolved in ethanol
and then in media. MPA and NETA were chosen as two
representative progestins used in HRT.
Cell proliferation assay
MCF-7:5C cells were harvested after treatment with vehicle
(0.1% ethanol), E2 (109 mol/L, 1 nmol/L), Dex (106 mol/L, 1
mmol/L), MPA (106 mol/L, 1 mmol/L), NETA (106 mol/L, 1
mmol/L), R5020 (106 mol/L, 1 mmol/L), RU486 (106 mol/L, 1
mmol/L), 4-OHT (106 mol/L, 1 mmol/L), or combinations, in
triplicate, for speciﬁed time. Media and treatments were
replaced every 3 days. DNA content was measured as using
the Fluorescent DNA Quantitation Kit (Bio-Rad).
Immunoblotting
ERa (sc-544), GR (glucocorticoid receptor; sc-8892), and PR
(progesterone receptor; sc-810) antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, PARP (#9532S) antibody from
Cell Signaling Technology, and b-actin antibody (A5441) from
Sigma-Aldrich. Proteins were harvested from cells in 10-cm
dishes using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set I and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Set II (Calbiochem). Bicinchoninic
acid assay was used to quantify total protein content (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Protein (50 mg) was probed and visualized as
previously described (18).
Annexin V analysis of apoptosis
Apoptosis was quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry using the FITC
Annexin V Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. MCF-7:5C cells were treated, suspended in 1 binding buffer, and stained simultaneously with

www.aacrjournals.org

FITC-labeled Annexin V (FL1-H) and PI (FL2-H). Cells were
analyzed using FACSort ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Cells were harvested from 6-well plates using TRIzol, and
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). RNA
was reverse transcribed using an Applied Biosystems kit. SYBR
green (Applied Biosystems) was used for quantitative real-time
PCR (RT-PCR) in triplicate in a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems).
GRE activity
Transient transfection assay was conducted using a dualluciferase system (Promega). To determine GR transcriptional
activity, cells were transfected in 24-well plates for 24 hours
with a glucocorticoid response element (GRE)–regulated dualluciferase reporter plasmid (gift from Dr. Anne Gompel, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France) or an estrogen response
element (ERE)–regulated dual-luciferase reporter plasmid (gift
from Dr. Rebecca Riggins, Georgetown University, Washington, DC). Cells were treated with speciﬁed compounds for 24
hours following transfection, in triplicate. Cells were then
harvested and processed for dual-luciferase reporter activity,
in which ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla
luciferase activity.
Statistical analysis
Values reported are means  SEM. Signiﬁcant differences
were found by the Student t test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
MCF-7:5C growth patterns with HRT compounds
MCF-7:5C cells represent a stable cell line derived from
parental MCF-7 cells by long-term estrogen deprivation, and
are the relevant cells used in the following studies. They are
estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, GR-positive, and PR-negative (Supplementary Fig. S1A). MCF-7:5C cells were treated
for 8 days with a vehicle, R5020, Dex, MPA, or NETA
(another progestin used in HRT; Fig. 1A). R5020 was used
as a pure progestin-positive control and had no effect on
growth. After 8 days, Dex and MPA caused a 28.7% and
21.6% decrease in MCF-7:5C cell DNA, respectively, compared with vehicle treatment. NETA, however, caused a
93.6% decrease in MCF-7:5C cells. Dose–response assays
were carried out with various concentrations of the compounds in both MCF-7:5C (Supplementary Fig. S2) and in
the parental estrogen-sensitive MCF-7:WS8 cells (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S7).
MCF-7:5C cells were then treated longer with the compounds (Fig. 1B). Again, cells treated with Dex and MPA do
not grow as quickly as the control cells. NETA and estradiol (E2)
both cause MCF-7:5C cell death; minimal DNA is sustained for
6 weeks of treatment. To mimic HRT, MCF-7:5C cells were
treated with combinations of E2þMPA and E2þNETA, and
compared with vehicle, E2 alone, and E2þDex (Fig. 1C). Cells
treated with 1 nmol/L E2 die during the ﬁrst week of treatment,
but Dex and MPA seem to reverse this effect; cells are able to

grow. E2þNETA trigger the same death response as E2 alone,
suggesting NETA's role as an estrogen. Also, NETA decreases
MCF-7:5C ER levels similarly to the effect of E2 after 2 months
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B). NETA caused the growth
of MCF-7:WS8 cell and this was blocked by the 4-OHT or
fulvestrant (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Dex and MPA block E2-induced apoptosis in MCF-7:5C
MCF-7:5C cells underwent these same treatments for 72
hours, and Annexin V staining was measured by ﬂow cytometry to indicate apoptosis (Fig. 2A). E2 caused 29.03 (1.44)%
of cells to undergo apoptosis. Dex was able to block this
apoptosis as shown by E2þDex causing only 5.37 (0.35)% of
cells to stain for Annexin V. NETA and E2þNETA show similar
Annexin V staining as E2 alone; both treatments cause apoptosis (30.17  0.65 and 33.23  0.97%, respectively). Although
MCF-7:5C cells are eventually able to grow under E2þMPA
treatment (Fig. 1C), MPA is not able to block initial E2-induced
apoptosis at 72 hours; more time is required for MPA to exert
its subtle long-term effect. When Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage is probed by Western blot analysis to
indicate apoptosis, again we show that E2 alone, and in
combination with MPA, causes apoptosis after 72 hour treatments. However, MPA can block E2-induced apoptosis after 6,
9, and 12 days of combination treatment, as shown by
decreased cleaved PARP protein expression. This conﬁrms the
biologic effect already seen, as MCF-7:5C cells can grow in the
presence of E2þMPA (Fig. 2B).

7062

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

After a 2-month treatment, microscopy photographs
were taken to illustrate the dramatic effects Dex and MPA
have on E2-treated cells. Cells treated with both E2 and
E2þNETA show a reduction in MCF-7:5C cell number.
E2þDex and E2þMPA treatments both allow MCF-7:5C
cells to grow during the 2 months of treatment as demonstrated by increased cell number seen in the photographs (Fig. 2C).
NETA functions as an estrogen at high concentration
To illustrate estrogenic actions of NETA, MCF-7:5C cell
DNA was measured after treatment with the drugs alone and
in combination with 4-OHT, an antiestrogen. As a positive
control, the data conﬁrm that 4-OHT is able to reverse E2's
apoptotic action as shown by signiﬁcantly increased DNA
when MCF-7:5C cells are treated with combination compared with E2 alone. 4-OHT also has the ability to reverse
NETA's decrease in MCF-7:5C DNA, suggesting its role as an
estrogen (Fig. 3A). Estrogen target gene mRNA expression
was then measured in MCF-7:WS8 cells by RT-PCR. Whereas
Dex and MPA generate no increase in estrogen target genes
pS2 (Fig. 3B) or PR (Supplementary Fig. S4), NETA elicits
signiﬁcant upregulation of both pS2 (23.6- and 46.9-fold) and
PR (30.6- and 81.0-fold) at the two higher concentrations
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4). This result is similar to
that of E2, which increases pS2 64.9-fold and PR 58.9-fold
over vehicle (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4) in MCF-7:
WS8 cells after 24 hour treatment. Furthermore, when MCF-

1 mmol/L NETA, or combinations, for 72 hours. Cells were harvested and apoptosis was measured by Annexin V staining and ﬂow cytometry. Means represent

magniﬁcation, 10; exposure time, 1/1000 seconds.

7:5C cells are transiently transfected with an ERE–luciferase
construct, NETA is able to generate 8.12-fold higher ERE
activity than vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3C). This increased
ERE activity is blocked by ICI (Fig. 3C) and 4-OHT (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting its reliance on the ER. Similar
ERE activity results were generated in MCF-7:WS8 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6).

MPA functions as a glucocorticoid through GR similarly
to Dex
To classify MPA as a glucocorticoid similar to Dex, MCF-7:5C
cell DNA was quantiﬁed after treatment with the drugs alone
and in combination with RU486, an anti-glucocorticoid. Dex
and MPA alone cause a reduction in MCF-7:5C cell DNA;
however, RU486 can reverse this reduction when treated in
combination (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that MPA could be
working through the GR in these cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

To further test glucocorticoid behavior of MPA, GR target
gene SGK1 mRNA was quantiﬁed by RT-PCR. Dex and MPA
dramatically increased SGK1 expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). This upregulation was inhibited by at
least 50% when RU486 was added in combination to treatment, suggesting a GR-mediated mechanism. Furthermore,
GRE activity was detected by transiently transfecting MCF7:5C cells with a GRE–luciferase reporter vector. The cells
were then treated for 24 hours with a vehicle, RU486, R5020,
Dex, MPA, NETA, or combinations. Cells treated with Dex
induced 289.39 (0.11)-fold GRE activity over vehicle-treated cells, conﬁrming the validity of the assay. Importantly,
MPA also caused 99.44 (0.01)-fold more GRE activity
compared with vehicle, indicating its ability to activate GR
transcription (Fig. 4C). GRE activity generated by both Dex
and MPA was blocked by RU486 when treated in combination (Fig. 4C). NETA was unable to elicit a dramatic increase
in GRE activity (Fig. 4C).

Figure 3. NETA functions as an estrogen at high concentration. A, MCF-7:5C cells were treated with vehicle, 1 mmol/L 4-OHT, 1 nmol/L E2, 1 mmol/L NETA, or
combinations for 7 days, and DNA was quantiﬁed;    , P < 0.001. B, MCF-7:WS8 cells were treated with vehicle, 1 nmol/L E2, or 10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L,
or 1 mmol/L concentrations of Dex, MPA, or NETA for 24 hours. pS2 mRNA expression was quantiﬁed by RT-PCR. 36B4 was used as an internal control.
Means represent three samples in triplicate. C, MCF-7:5C cells were transfected with an ERE–luciferase reporter construct for 24 hours, then treated
with vehicle, 1 mmol/L ICI, 1 mmol/L MPA, 1 mmol/L NETA, 1 nmol/L E2, or combinations for 24 hours. ERE activity was measured by luciferase assay and
normalized to vehicle control. Means represent samples in triplicate; error bars, too small to visualize.

Dex and MPA block E2-induced apoptosis-related genes
similarly
To explore pathways involved in Dex and MPA blocking
E2-induced apoptosis, RT-PCR was performed using primers
for genes associated with E2-induced apoptosis. E2 triggers
apoptosis in MCF-7:5C cells by increasing levels of TNFa,
HMOX1, LTA, and LTB after 72 hours of treatment. Both Dex
and MPA are able to signiﬁcantly decrease upregulation of these
genes in response to E2 when treated in combination (Fig. 5). This
suggests that MPA can work in a similar way as Dex by blocking
key genes necessary for E2 to initiate apoptosis in this setting.

Discussion
The hypothesis addressed in this study is whether a synthetic progestin in HRT that exhibits glucocorticoid activity

7064

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

can interfere with E2-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
The results of the WHI indicate an increase in the risk of breast
cancer in women taking CEEþMPA (15); MPA was, therefore,
expected to increase the growth of breast cancer cells in the
presence of E2 in our well-studied cellular model, and was
predicted to function as a glucocorticoid. To test this hypothesis, Dex was used as a known glucocorticoid-positive control
that can block E2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A). This classiﬁcation of Dex is consistent with reports in the literature that
indicate that glucocorticoids can prevent apoptosis in various
contexts of cancer (19–21).
Reports in the literature demonstrate the potential of synthetic progestins to bind and activate other nuclear receptors
than their own cognate receptors. NETA and other 19-nortestosterone derivatives have been shown to activate the ER and
stimulate the growth of estrogen-responsive MCF-7 and T47D

Figure 4. MPA functions as a glucocorticoid. A, MCF-7:5C cells were treated with vehicle, 1 mmol/L RU486, 1 mmol/L Dex, 1 mmol/L MPA, or combinations for 7
days, and DNA was quantiﬁed. Means represent samples in triplicate;  , P < 0.05. B, MCF-7:5C cells were treated for 24, 48, or 72 hours with vehicle,
1 mmol/L RU486, 100 nmol/L Dex or MPA, or combinations. SGK1 mRNA expression was measured by RT-PCR. 36B4 was used as an internal control. C,
MCF-7:5C cells were transfected with a GRE–luciferase reporter construct for 24 hours, then treated with vehicle, 1 mmol/L RU486, 1 mmol/L R5020,
1 mmol/L NETA, 100 nmol/L Dex, 100 nmol/L MPA, or combinations for 24 hours. GRE activity was measured by luciferase assay and normalized to vehicle

cells (22, 23). The estrogenic activity of NETA is conﬁrmed in this
work through its ability to increase cell replication (DNA) in
MCF-7:WS8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C), to elevate estrogen
target genes (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S4), generate apoptosis
in MCF-7:5C cells (Fig. 2A), increase ER transcriptional activity
(Fig. 3C, Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6), and has its action be
blocked by 4-OHT and ICI (Fig. 3A and C). Notably, reports have
indicated that the synthetic progestin, MPA can bind to and
activate not only the PR, but also the GR in breast cancer (24). A
more recent report shows that MPA has afﬁnity for the GR and
can compete with the natural glucocorticoid, cortisol, in the
body (25). Others have recently demonstrated that MPA can
increase glucocorticoid activity in MCF-7 cells (26).
The data presented in this study integrate the previously
published ﬁndings and establish that MPA functions as a
glucocorticoid in long-term estrogen-deprived breast cancer

cells, blocking E2-induced apoptosis and allowing cells to grow
(Fig. 1C). MPA cannot block E2-induced apoptosis as early as
Dex (Fig. 2A); it requires at least 6 days to gain sufﬁcient
glucocorticoid activity (Fig. 2B and C). When MPA is able to
inhibit E2-induced apoptosis, like Dex, it acts by preventing
upregulation of important E2-induced apoptosis-related genes
(Fig. 5). We have noted previously that Dex decreases the
growth of MCF-7:5C cells and blocks E2-induced apoptosis
(27). Dex blocks E2-simulated growth of MCF-7:WS8 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7). MPA prevents E2-stimulated growth
at high concentration (106 mol/L), with similar effect as the
more potent Dex in wild-type MCF-7:WS8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). This inhibition is not an effect of the progestin
action of MPA as R5020, a progestin with no glucocorticoid
action has no effect on E2-stimulated MCF-7:WS8 growth
(Supplementary Fig. S7A).

MPA, or combinations for 72 hours. RT-PCR was performed using primers for TNFa (A), HMOX1 (B), LTA (C), and LTB (D). 36B4 was used as an internal control.
Means represent three samples in triplicate;    , P < 0.001.

Although others have demonstrated MPA's function as a
glucocorticoid (24–26), it is illustrated here as a mechanistic
explanation for the increased breast cancer risk observed in
the CEEþMPA arm of the WHI clinical trials (15). By
modeling the environment of postmenopausal breast cancer
using long-term estrogen-deprived MCF-7:5C cells, we can
predict clinical responses through laboratory experiments.
In so doing, we propose a unifying hypothesis of the modulation of E2-induced apoptosis to explain the results of the
WHI HRT trial in population of postmenopausal women
over the age of 60 years (15).
Critical to the understanding of how these effects occur,
studies describe the interplay between ER and GR, and how
AP-1 can integrate their transcriptional responses (28).
Recent reports (29) also show that the ER and GR can
interact and cause differential activation by reconﬁguring
the chromatin structure at GRE or ERE sites in the DNA.
Furthermore, it is shown that GR can inhibit ER transcrip-

tional activity and ER-mediated proliferation in breast cancer (30). Consistently, Dex blocks E2-stimulated MCF-7:WS8
cell replication (Supplementary Fig. S7). We can speculate
that when MPA binds to the GR, the complex binds to GREs
in the DNA, which then affects the ability of ligand-bound
ER to functionally transcribe ER target genes. In order for
E2-induced apoptosis to occur, E2 binds to ER, resulting in
transcription of genes (e.g., HMOX1, TNFa, etc.) necessary
for apoptosis. When this process is inhibited, possibly by the
chromatin remodeling actions of MPA-bound GR, apoptosis
is decreased even in an estrogenic setting.
Inﬂammation is also critical for MCF-7:5C cells to undergo
apoptosis; it has been shown that E2 upregulates key inﬂammatory genes in these cells (11). Glucocorticoids function to
block inﬂammation, and are used in the clinic as anti-inﬂammatory drugs. Dex and MPA may prevent E2-induced apoptosis
by downregulating proinﬂammatory genes (e.g., IFNL1, BCL10,
IL4R, FADS1, etc.) through binding to GR.

Estrogen-Induced Apoptosis in Hormone Replacement Therapy

It is important to consider timing when considering the
implications of this work; timing of HRT can make a dramatic
difference in response to treatment (31, 32). MCF-7:5C cells
represent long-term estrogen-deprived cells, we sought this is
the biologic context required in the patient as well to replicate
the patient population in the WHI CEE alone trial (15).
Previous studies have examined how a "gap" is needed after
menopause to sufﬁciently deprive women's nascent breast
cancer cells of estrogen (33). Five to 10 years postmenopause
is appropriate to ensure effective apoptosis when CEE is
introduced to the woman (31). Without this delay, exogenous
estrogen may stimulate breast cancer growth, resulting in
increased breast cancer risk; in fact, studies show that breast
cancer risk is greater when HRT is initiated closer to menopause (34).
The ﬁndings presented can have clinical impact as
CEEþMPA is frequently taken by postmenopausal women to
alleviate menopausal symptoms. Patients should perhaps be
advised to choose a different approach with a selective ER
modulator (SERM)/CEE combination (35), and also to delay
HRT until they are appropriately past menopause. Because the
synthetic progestin NETA can prevent endometrial cancer, and
also cause breast cancer apoptosis like an estrogen, it appears
to be a logical alternative to MPA as an alternative approved
synthetic progestin that could be used in HRT.
