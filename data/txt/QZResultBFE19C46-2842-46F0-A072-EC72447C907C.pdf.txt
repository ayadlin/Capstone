Abstract
Expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER) A govern estrogendependent growth, response to endocrine therapy, and
prognosis in ERA-positive breast cancer. Multiple mechanisms
involved in altering ERA gene expression in breast cancer
have been identified, including ERA gene amplification as well
as transcriptional silencing by DNA methylation of CpG
islands within the ERA promoter and mutations within the
open reading frame of ERA. However, expression levels of ERA
in breast cancer tissues differ widely among patients, and
frequently change during disease progression and in response
to systemic therapies. Recent evidence has shown that
microRNA mutations or misexpression correlate with various
human cancers, and miR-206 is reported to decrease
endogenous ERA mRNA and protein levels in human MCF-7
breast cancer cells via two specific target sites within the
3¶-untranslated region of the human ERA transcript. In this
study, we show for the first time that miR-206 expression is
markedly decreased in ERA-positive human breast cancer
tissues assayed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
analysis. Moreover, we observe that miR-206 expression is
inversely correlated with ERA but not ERB mRNA expression
in breast cancer tissues. Transfection experiments revealed
that introduction of miR-206 into estrogen-dependent MCF-7
breast cancer cells inhibits cell growth in a dose- and timedependent manner. Our results suggest that miR-206 could be
a novel candidate for endocrine therapy that targets only ERA
in breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5004–8]

Introduction
Estrogen receptor (ER) a is essential for estrogen-dependent
growth, and its level of expression is a crucial determinant of
response to endocrine therapy and prognosis in ERa-positive
breast cancer. There is no doubt that the more ERa present in the
tumor cells, the greater the likelihood of a favorable response to
endocrine therapy (1). However, little is known about how the
expression of ERa in human breast cancer is regulated.
ERa acts as a ligand-activated oncogene product in breast
tissues. Expression of the human ERa gene (ESR1) is controlled at
the transcriptional level by seven different promoters used in a cellspecific manner (2). This complex transcriptional unit can undergo
alternative splicing, which has been shown to generate shorter ERa
isoforms (3). Multiple mechanisms involved in the silencing of
ESR1 gene expression in breast cancer have been identified,

including mutations within the open reading frame (3) and
transcriptional silencing by DNA methylation of promoterproximal CpG islands (4). It was recently reported that ERa gene
amplification is frequent in breast cancer and results in ERa
protein overexpression (5). However, breast cancer patients show a
wide range of ERa expression levels, and the levels of expression in
individual patients change during disease progression and in
response to systemic therapies. Therefore, other mechanisms may
also regulate ERa expression in breast cancer.
Recently, Adams and colleagues (6) reported that the microRNA
miR-206 decreases endogenous ERa mRNA and protein levels in
human MCF-7 breast cancer cells by acting through two specific
miR-206 target sites within the 3¶-untranslated region (UTR) of the
human ERa transcript. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class naturally
occurring small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression by
targeting mRNAs for translational repression or cleavage (7).
Primary miRNA transcripts are cleaved into 70- to 80-nucleotide
precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpins by RNase III Drosha in the
cell nucleus and transported to the cytoplasm, where pre-miRNAs
are processed by RNA Dicer into 19- to 25-nucleotide miRNA
duplexes. One strand of each duplex is degraded, and the other
strands become mature miRNAs, which, incorporated into the
RNA-induced silencing complex, recognize sites in the 3¶-UTR of
the target mRNAs and cause translational repression or mRNA
cleavage. miRNAs are a new player among gene regulation
mechanisms, and their functions have not been fully explored
but are known to include the regulation of cellular differentiation,
proliferation, and apoptosis. Recent evidence has shown that
miRNA mutations or misexpression are associated with various
human cancers and indicates that miRNAs can function as tumor
suppressors and oncogenes (8). MicroRNA expression profiling also
revealed that miRNAs are differently expressed among molecular
subtypes in breast cancer (9–11). Furthermore, recent studies have
shown that loss or gain of function of specific miRNAs, such as let7 (12), miR-10b (13), miR-21 (14), and mir-17-5p (15), contributes to
breast epithelial cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.
The present study was undertaken to assess the role of miR-206
in human breast cancer. We examined expression of miR-206 in
ERa-positive and ERa-negative human breast cancer tissues, and
found for the first time that miR-206 expression was markedly
decreased in ERa-positive breast cancer. Growth inhibition of
estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells transfected with miR-206
was also analyzed.

primary breast cancer (either mastectomy or lumpectomy). The samples
were chosen from the continuous series of invasive carcinoma tissues. ERa
protein expression status was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
as follows. One 4-Am section of each submitted paraffin block was stained

first with H&E to verify that an adequate number of invasive carcinoma
cells were present and that the fixation quality was adequate for IHC
analysis. Serial sections (4 Am) were prepared from selected blocks and float
mounted on adhesive-coated glass slides, for staining with monoclonal
mouse anti-human ERa antibody (1D5; DAKO) at 1:100 dilution as
described previously (16). The DAKO Envision system (DAKO EnVision–
labeled polymer, peroxidase) was used for detection. After the entire slide
was evaluated by light microscopy, expression of ERa was scored by
proportion and intensity, according to Allred’s procedure (17). In brief,
the proportion score represented the estimated proportion of tumor
cells staining positive was as follows: 0 (none), 1 (<1/100), 2 (1/100 to 1/10),
3 (1/10 to 1/3), 4 (1/3 to 2/3), and 5 (>2/3). Any brown nuclear staining in
invasive breast epithelium counted toward the proportion score. The
intensity score represented the average intensity of the positive cells was as
follows: 0 (none), 1 (weak), 2 (intermediate), and 3 (strong). The proportion
and intensity scores were then added to obtain a total score, which could
range from 0 to 8. Among 383 cases from which paired frozen tissue
samples were available, 203 cases with HER2-negative tumors were used in
this study from 246 cases which HER2 status was known. Forty-five tumors
with scores of 0 to 2 made up the ERa-negative group in this study, and
49 tumors with score 8 composed the ERa-positive group. HER2-positive
tumors were excluded in this study (Table 1).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR detection of miRNA. Total
RNA was extracted from f500 mg of frozen breast cancer tissue using
TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (18). cDNA
was reverse transcribed from total RNA samples using specific miRNA
primers from the Taq Man MicroRNA Assays and reagents from the Taq
Man MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). The
resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using Taq Man MicroRNA Assay
primers with the Taq Man Universal PCR Master Mix and analyzed with a
7500 ABI PRISM Sequence Detector System according to the manufacturer’s

mRNA expression were calculated from the relevant signals by normalization with the signal for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) mRNA expression. The assay numbers for ERa, ERh, progesterone
receptor (PR), cyclin D1, pS2, and GAPDH were as follows: Hs00174860_m1
for ERa, Hs00230957_m1 for ERh, Hs00172183_m1 for PR, Hs00277039_m1
for cyclin D1, Hs00170216_m1 for pS2, and Hs99999905_m1 for GAPDH
(Applied Biosystems).
Cell culture and transfections. MCF-7 cells (American Type Culture
Collection) were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/mL and
50 mg/mL, respectively), at 37jC with 5% CO2. Transfections of pre–miR206 precursor (hsa-miR-206; Ambion) were performed with Cell Line
Nucleofector kits (Amaxa) using a Nucleofector device (Amaxa) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. A nonspecific control miRNA (Anti-miR
miRNA Inhibitors-Negative Control #1; Ambion) was used as a negative
control.
Cell proliferation assay. After transfection, MCF-7 cells (4,000 cells per
well) were plated in 96-well plates and incubated in RPMI 1640 containing
10% FBS or in RPMI 1640 without phenol red containing 10% charcoal/
dextran-treated FBS (HyClone Laboratories), in the presence or absence of
17h-estradiol (E2, 10 nmol/L; Sigma). Cell growth was measured using Cell
Proliferation Reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science) by incubating cells for
3 h with the reagent and recording absorbance at 450 nm with a 96-well
plate reader.
Statistical analysis. The unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare
expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs in ERa-positive and ERa-negative
tumors. The differences between miR-206 expression levels corresponding
to various ERa protein scores were compared by one-way ANOVA followed
by the Tukey-Kramer test. Correlation between miR-206 expression and
ERa and ERh mRNA expression was assessed by regression analysis.
Differences between treatments on cell growth were compared by one-way
ANOVA followed by the Dunnett’s test.

were calculated from the relevant signals by normalization with the signal
for U6B miRNA expression. The assay names for miR-206, miR-30c, and U6B
were as follows: hsa-mir-206 for miR-206, hsa-mir-30c for miR-30c, and

miR-206 expression is down-regulated in ERA-positive
human breast cancer. We first examined expression levels of
miR-206 in ERa-positive and ERa-negative human breast cancer
tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR detection analysis showed that the
expression levels of miR-206 were much higher in the ERa-negative
tumors (0.67 F 0.52; range, 0.15–2.25) than in the ERa-positive
tumors (0.31 F 0.34; range, 0.06–1.66; P = 0.0001; Fig. 1A). We then
tested expression of another miRNA, miR-30c, in the same tissues
because it was reported that miR-30c expression, as assayed by
microRNA microarray analysis, was increased in ERa-positive
compared with ERa-negative breast cancer (9). Our quantitative
RT-PCR results showed no differences in miR-30c expression
between ERa-negative and ERa-positive tumors (30.8 F 25.4 versus
24.7 F 20.8, P = 0.21; Fig. 1B). We then extended the analysis of
miR-206 expression in breast cancer tissues to include all scores
for ERa protein expression, assessed semiquantitatively by IHC
(Fig. 1C). miR-206 expression levels were gradually decreased as
ERa protein scores increased. We conclude that miR-206
expression is markedly decreased in ERa-positive human breast
cancer tissues.
miR-206 expression is inversely correlated with ERA mRNA
expression in human breast cancer. We next examined ERa
mRNA expression in human breast cancer tissues. As expected,
the expression levels of ERa mRNA were much higher in the
ERa-positive tumors (16.1 F 12.1; range, 0.08–50.00) than in the
ERa-negative tumors (0.38 F 0.82; range, 0.005–3.20; P < 0.0001;
Fig. 2A). To analyze the association between miR-206 expression
and ERa mRNA expression, expression levels of miR-206 and ERa
mRNA were plotted. The scatterplots showed that miR-206

expression was inversely correlated with ERa mRNA expression in
human breast cancer (P = 0.002; Fig. 2B). In contrast, no
association was found between miR-206 expression and ERh
mRNA expression (P = 0.43; Fig. 2C).
miR-206 suppresses ERA expression and inhibits growth of
MCF-7 cells. To assess the role of miR-206 in the growth of ERapositive breast cancer, pre–miR-206 precursor was introduced into
proliferating MCF-7 cells. Cells were transfected with either control
miRNA (200 nmol/L) or pre–miR-206 precursor at 20 or 200 nmol/L
and incubated for up to 72 hours in a medium containing 10% FBS.
A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT)-based cell proliferation assay revealed that miR-206 strongly

inhibited cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner,
whereas MCF-7 cells transfected with control miRNA continued to
grow during the period (Fig. 3A). Introduction of miR-1, which is
expressed in muscle cells and promotes their differentiation as well
as miR-206 (19), also did not inhibit cell growth (data not shown).
When MCF-7 cells were transfected with pre–miR-206 precursor at
various concentrations and incubated for 72 hours, miR-206 induced
a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 3B). Introduction of
pre–miR-206 precursor at 200 nmol/L into proliferating MCF-7 cells
produced a significant 55% decrease in cell number compared with
cells transfected with negative control (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3B, top left).
Expression levels of ERa mRNA and miR-206 were quantitatively

measured using parallel samples. Transfection with pre–miR-206
induced a dose-dependent repression of ERa mRNA levels, whereas
it produced a dose-dependent increase of miR-206 levels (Fig. 3B,
top right and bottom left). To further validate the effect of miR-206
on growth of MCF-7 cells, mRNA expression of ERa-target genes,
such as PR, cyclin D1, and pS2, was quantitatively measured using
parallel samples (Fig. 3B, bottom right). Introduction of pre–miR-206
produced a dose-dependent decrease of mRNA expression of these
genes. We then extended our analysis to determine whether miR206 would affect estrogen-induced growth of MCF-7 cells. Similar
inhibition of growth by introduction of pre–miR-206 precursor at
200 nmol/L was observed when cells were cultured in a medium
containing charcoal/dextran-treated FBS in the presence of E2
(control +E2 versus pre–miR-206 +E2; Fig. 3C). In the absence of
E2, cell growth was also inhibited when cells were transfected with
pre–miR-206 (control -E2 versus pre–miR-206 -E2; Fig. 3C). The
cells may have been affected by low levels of estrogen present in
serum because MCF-7 cells transfected with negative control grew
slightly in the absence of added E2. From these analyses, we
conclude that introduction of miR-206 into estrogen-dependent
breast cancer cells leads to suppression of ERa mRNA expression
and inhibition of growth.

Discussion
In the present study, we have extended the basic, mechanistic
insight by Adams and colleagues (6) to actual breast cancer by
using clinically obtained tissue samples, and found that miR-206
expression is markedly decreased in ERa-positive human breast
cancer tissues. We also showed that introduction of miR-206 into
estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells leads to suppression of ERa
expression and growth inhibition.
In experimental models, a single miRNA can regulate a number
of genes (20). Previous studies have shown that miR-206 is
expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle and promotes muscle
differentiation by down-regulating the p180 subunit of DNA
polymerase a and myogenic transcription factors, Is1-3 and MyoR
(19). Adams and colleagues (6) recently identified two miR-206
binding sites within the 3¶-UTR of human ERa and showed that
miR-206 down-regulates ERa mRNA and protein expression in
breast cancer cells. Our results show that the expression levels of

miR-206 are much higher in ERa-negative than in ERa-positive
breast cancer tumors, and that the more ERa-positive cells present
in the tumor, the less miR-206 expression seen, suggesting that
miR-206 is a key factor for the regulation of ERa expression in
development and progression of human breast cancer.
Endocrine therapy has become the most important treatment
option for women with ERa-positive breast cancer, and f70% of
primary breast cancers express ERa. Although endocrine therapy
inhibits estrogen-dependent growth via ERa, the currently
available treatments, such as selective ER modulators and estrogen
deprivation therapy, affect the functions of both ERa and ERh. In
this study, we show that miR-206 expression is inversely correlated
with expression of ERa but not ERh in human breast cancer
tissues, and that introduction of miR-206 into estrogen-dependent
breast cancer cells suppresses ERa expression and inhibits cell
growth. Our results suggest that miR-206 would be a novel tool for
endocrine therapy that targets only ERa.
To analyze the role of miR-206 in development of breast cancer
could also be important for identifying the different molecular
mechanisms between ERa-positive and ERa-negative breast
cancers. In addition, miR-206 may serve as a key factor that
regulates ERa expression during the development of normal breast
epithelium because the expression of miR-206 is under hormonal
regulation (6), although the role of miR-206 in normal breast
tissues has not been studied.
In conclusion, the present data indicate for the first time that miR206 expression is markedly decreased in ERa-positive human breast
cancer tissues and that introduction of miR-206 into estrogendependent breast cancer cells inhibits cell growth. miR-206 could be a
novel candidate for ERa-specific endocrine therapy in breast cancer.
