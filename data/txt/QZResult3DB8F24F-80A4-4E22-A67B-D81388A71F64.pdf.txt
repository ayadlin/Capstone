ABSTRACT
Bevacizumab plus weekly paclitaxel improves progression-free survival (PFS)
in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC), but its use has been questioned
due to the absence of a predictive biomarker, lack of benefit in overall survival (OS)
and increased toxicity. We examined the baseline tumor angiogenic-related gene
expression of 60 patients with mBC with the aim of finding a signature that predicts
benefit from this drug.
Multivariate analysis by Lasso-penalized Cox regression generated two predictive
models: one, named G-model, including 11 genes, and the other one, named GCmodel, including 13 genes plus 5 clinical covariates. Both models identified patients
with improved PFS (HR (Hazard Ratio) 2.57 and 4.04, respectively) and OS (HR 3.29
and 3.43, respectively). The G-model distinguished low and high risk patients in the
first 6 months, whereas the GC-model maintained significance over time.

survival (OS), possibly due to the confounding effect
of post-progression therapy, lack of statistical power, or
treatment crossover. This, along with economic issues,
lack of validated biomarkers and increased toxicity has put
into question the role of bevacizumab in mBC. Nowadays,
the identification of predictive biomarkers for this drug
remains a challenge.
Technological improvements in molecular profiling
have allowed a better knowledge of breast cancer biology,
leading to the development of new tests that help in
clinical decision making.
In the present study we analysed a set of 168 genes
related to angiogenesis and other processes on a discrete
series of patients treated with bevacizumab and weekly
paclitaxel. Our aim was to find a molecular signature
predicting PFS benefit from this regimen. To date, this is
the first report of a biomarker profile with PFS prediction.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease regarding
molecular and clinical features. In the metastatic setting,
the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2) and hormonal receptors determine the selection
of therapies. Treatment for HER-2 negative mBC includes
hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and bevacizumab
combined regimens.
In the pivotal E2100 study, bevacizumab plus
weekly paclitaxel increased overall response rate (50% vs
22%) and progression-free survival (PFS) (median of 11.8
vs 5.9 months) compared to paclitaxel alone [1]. Other
phase III trials in mBC also reported a PFS benefit with
the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy, both in
first [2, 3] and second line therapies [4]. However, none
of them showed a significant improvement in overall

patients had received prior therapy with anthracyclines
and taxanes, and 40% had been treated with one or more
previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease.
Forty-five percent of the patients achieved a
partial response and 13% a complete response. Median
PFS was 11.4 months (range 0.5-46.1), and median OS
was 29 months (range 1.41-44.8). All patients received
bevacizumab until progression, but paclitaxel had to be
discontinued after 6-8 cycles in 32 patients, mostly due to
toxicity. During the bevacizumab continuation phase, 15
patients (53.5% of estrogen receptor -ER- positive patients
with continuation treatment) also received hormonal
therapy.

Univariate analysis of clinical and pathological
variables for PFS is presented in Table 2. Disease-free
interval (DFI), ER and metastatic location (3 or more
locations or hepatic involvement) were significantly
associated with PFS. Summary information for the gene
expression measurements as well as the Hazard Ratio
(HR) for the association between the gene expression
values and PFS is presented on Supplementary Table. Nine

results from the univariate analysis. Figure 1 shows
Kaplan Meier plots for progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS) in G and GC models. The HR,
differences in median and p values for these predictions
are summarized in Tables 6 (PFS) and 7(OS).

Comparison of accuracy of prediction of the
models through roc curves
Models were also compared to evaluate the gain of
accuracy by time-dependent ROC curves [8], and results
are shown in Figure 2. In the first 6 months G and GC
models worked better than C model (AUC 0.68 and
0.72 versus AUC 0.53 respectively). The G model lose
accuracy with longer follow-up, whereas GC remained
accurate over time, as shown in Figures 2c and 2d.

Multivariate cox models
A multivariate analysis with five clinical variables
(DFI, ER, ML, prior anthracyclines and taxanes, and
prior chemotherapy treatment for metastatic disease) was
associated with PFS (Table 3). This was defined as the
clinical or C-model.
We then combined clinical and gene variables
into two models using the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO) [6] [7] for variable selection:
one model had gene expression only (G-model), and the
other had both gene expression and clinical variables (GCmodel). The G-model included 11 genes (SLC39A6, REL,
IL8, FN1, PLAU, HES1, HMBS, DDIT4, FABP5, ACVRL1,
PGR) (Table 4). The GC-model consists of 13 genes (REL,
FN1, NOTCH3, DDIT4, IL8, ADRBK1, FABP5, PLAU,
HMBS, PTK2B, THBS1, SLC39A6, TCF3) and the five
clinical variables mentioned previously (Table 5). The beta
coefficient signs of the genes agreed with the expression

Inmunohistochemistry evaluation of biomarkers
Tissue microarrays (TMA) were used to evaluate the
protein expression encoded by those genes with the higher
beta coefficients: cREL, SLC39A6, NOTCH, FN1 and
DDIT4. A summary of these studies is shown in Figure
3. None of the proteins analyzed were independently
associated with PFS.

DISCUSSION
Bevacizumab was approved as first-line treatment
for mBC in 2008. Three years later, the Food and Drug
Administration revoked the indication due to increased

toxicity without a clear benefit in OS. However, the
European Medicines Agency decided to keep the
indication, but only in combination with paclitaxel
(regimen with the most benefit in SLP).
The identification of a reliable biomarker would
avoid unnecessary toxicity in non-responders, reduce
healthcare costs, and therefore improve cost-effectiveness.
VEGF is a master regulator of angiogenesis, and should
be expected to predict response to bevacizumab, but the
results of different studies are controversial. Translational
studies associated to bevacizumab trials in mBC have
shown a possible role of plasmatic VEGFA (pVEGFA) and
VEGFR2 levels as response predictors [9-12]. However,
preliminary results of the prospective study Meridian
showed that baseline pVEGFA levels were not associated
to improved PFS [13].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Due to the high number of genes involved in
angiogenesis, a single biomarker is unlikely to predict
benefit from bevacizumab. Therefore, identification of
alternative biomarkers is a main subject for translational
oncology research, and, to our knowlegde, this is the
first report of a biomarker profile predicting PFS benefit
in mBC patients treated with bevacizumab and weekly
paclitaxel.
We selected a group of genes described to have
a role in angiogenesis and other related processes, to
investigate if any combination could impact on response
to bevacizumab [5]. In the multivariate analysis we
decided to include clinical factors found to be relevant
in another study with bevacizumab-containing therapy
[14]. Some of these factors did not reach statistical
significance, probably due to the small sample size.

SLC39A6 and REL in the G-model, and FN1 and, again,
REL in the GC-model had the highest weight.
SLC39A6 expression has been described in clinical
breast-tumour populations as significantly associated
with the estrogen receptor status [15]. It has also been
associated with the spread of breast cancer to regional
lymph nodes [16, 17]. Interestingly, this gene had the
highest beta coefficient in the G-model, but one of the
lowest in the GC one, where ER is also included.
FN1 has been previously described as part of an
extracellular matrix gene cluster associated with resistance
to first-line tamoxifen therapy in patients with mBC and
with the development of metastasis [18] [19].
REL is part of the nuclear factor-κappaB (NF-κB)
complexes. It had the highest beta coefficient in both
models, being associated with improved PFS and OS.
The involvement of NF-κB in neoplastic proliferation
of human breast cancer cells has been described under
estrogen-free conditions in vitro, where it induces additive
anticancer effects with tamoxifen [20]. Its specific role

This is the main weakness of our study, along with the
absence of a validation set. Validation was not feasible
because of the limited number of patients treated with
bevacizumab and paclitaxel. Possible biases are difficult
to be controlled in a retrospective study, including the
use of chemotherapy before bevacizumab and the use of
hormonal therapy during the bevacizumab continuation
phase in some patients. The latter group was not included
in the multivariate analysis.
On the other hand, the strengths of our work are
the biological plausibility of the selected genes, the low
number of genes included in the models, and the statistical
method that offers a robust internal validation.
The G-model consists of 11 genes, and the GCmodel includes 5 clinical covariates and 13 genes. Among
the genes, 8 are present in both models: SLC39A6,
REL, IL8; FN1, PLAU, HES1, HMBS, DDIT4, FABP5,
ACVRL1, and PGR. The sign of beta coefficients agrees
in all cases with the expression results of the univariate
analysis of the genes, and is maintained in both models.

in antiangiogenic therapy response should be further
characterized.
We used LASSO Cox regression model to determine
genes significantly related to PFS. This model accounts
for overfitting, a problem inherent to studies where the
number of genes far exceeds the number of patients. The
output is a profile with a reduced number of genes, which
makes it more suitable for clinical application. We also
used LOOCV method, and a permutation test to assess
the statistical significance of the models. Both GC and G
models fared better than C model, being correlated with
PFS and OS (Table 7).

We also tested the predictive accuracy of these
models by time-dependent ROC curves (Figure 2).
The relative weight of the gene component in G and
GC models remained constant over time, whereas the
clinical variables were important in the long term. A
plausible explanation is that clinical parameters are purely
prognostic, whereas genes predict benefit from treatment,
so their influence is detected earlier.
In summary, we described two models that predict
improved PFS and OS with bevacizumab-paclitaxel
therapy: the G-model included a combination of 11 genes,
and the (GC-model consisted of 13 genes and 5 clinical

Gene expression analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RNA purification from FFPE samples
Sixty archival FFPE cases were evaluated by two
breast cancer expert pathologists. Regions of invasive
carcinoma were confirmed, and different areas with more
than 80% of malignant epithelial cells were selected. Four
to eight μm sections were used for total RNA isolation,
with MasterPure RNA Purification Kit (EPICENTRE
Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) according to the
manufacturer´s instructions with minor modifications.
RNA concentrations and quality were measured using
a Nanodrop 1000A spectrophotometer (Nanodrop
Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).

Patient selection and tumor sample collection
The study was approved by our institutional
Ethics Committee. Patients with a diagnosis of HER2negative mBC between 2007 and 2011 and treated with
bevacizumab and paclitaxel were identified from local
records. The schedule consisted of bevacizumab 10 mg/
m2 days 1 and 15 plus weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/2 days 1,
8 and 15, on a 28-day cycle. REMARK criteria were used
to help in patient selection [21].
Seventy eight patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Six of them were excluded due to the absence of primary
tumor biopsy, and another 12 because of poor quality
material. The study included the primary tumor from
60 patients. All of them had a minimum follow-up of
18 months since the beginning of the treatment (unless
progression and/or death due to mBC occurred before).
Patients with an early withdrawal due to toxicity were not
included.
The variable selected to generate a gene signature
was progression-free survival, defined as the time from the

thermal cycler for 10 min at 25°C, 120 min at 37°C, and
then held at 4°C.
The RT obtained products were amplified using
a Real Time Ready Custom panel 384 (Hoffmann-La

Roche, Basel, Switzerland). This platform enables the
quantitation of 168 genes (Supplementary Table) plus
19 housekeeping (HK) genes and 5 internal controls per

literature as related with the angiogenic process and other
progression and resistance mechanisms, such as EMT or
inflammation.
Nineteen housekeeping (HK) genes were also
included in the study (Supplementary Table 1). Twelve of

indicators. Cross-validated time dependent receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curves were computed
using the cross-validated risk scores. The area under the
curve (AUC) values calculated from the CV ROC curves
were used as measure of predictive accuracy of the models
[8]. All statistical analyses were performed using R
software (version 3.1.1) and the analysis was conducted by
the penalized and survival ROC packages in R software.

Statistical analysis
Univariate Cox regression models were fitted
to evaluate the association between continuous RNA
expression values and clinical covariates with survival.
The prediction models were built with penalized
multivariate Cox regression proportional hazards
modelling using L1-penalized (Lasso). A cross-validated
(CV) risk score was calculated by leave-one-out crossvalidation (LOOCV) for each model [6, 7]. Patients were
classified into high- and low-risk groups, based on the
median value of the cross-validated risk score, and crossvalidated Kaplan-Meier curves (CV KM) were estimated.
A log-rank statistic was computed for the CV KM plots
and the statistical significance was evaluated based on
the permutation distribution of the cross-validated logrank-statistic, repeating the whole LOOCV process
with randomly permuted survival times and censoring

Inmunohistochemistry analysis
Genes found to be related to PFS in the multivariate
analysis were further analyzed by tissue microarray.
Representative areas of the tumors were selected on
hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and marked on
individual paraffin blocks by an expert pathologist in the
field. Two tissue cores (1 mm in diameter) were obtained
from each specimen. The tissue cores were arrayed into a
receptor paraffin block using a TMA workstation (Beecher
Instruments, Silver Spring, MD, USA), as described
previously [23]. A hematoxylin and eosin-stained section
of the array was reviewed to confirm the presence of

morphologically representative areas of the original
lesions.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as
described previously [24] on 4um sections of the TMAs,
obtained by a semiautomated microtome HM3508
(Microm). Briefly, the tissue sections were deparaffinized
and rehydrated in water, after which antigen retrieval
was carried out in a DAKO PT Link in citrate buffer
(pH=6). Endogenous peroxidase and nonspecific antibody
reactivity was blocked with peroxidase blocking reagent
(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at room temperature for
15 min.
The sections were then incubated for 60 min with
the following antibodies: rabbit monoclonal cMET (SP44,
#790-4430, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland)
and cREL (EPR2258, #ab108299, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK); rabbit polyclonal: FN1 (#A0245, Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark), SLC39A6 (#ab61307), DDIT4 (#ab63059),
and NOTCH3 (#ab60087), all these last from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK). Detection was performed with Envision
Plus Detection System (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).
Cytoplasmic staining for cREL and SLC39A6,
as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for DDIT4
was classified as negative, focal or diffuse. NOTCH3
presence was diffuse when present, so we evaluated
absence or weak/strong staining. Stromal FN1 staining
observed in the stromal component was also evaluated.
The pathologists performing the immunohistochemistry
analysis were blinded for patient´s outcome.
