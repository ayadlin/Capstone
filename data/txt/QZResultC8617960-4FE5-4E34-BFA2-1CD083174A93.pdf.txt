BACKGROUND. There is increasing interest in the use of a weekly administration of
docetaxel as a way of reducing its hematologic toxicity. The purpose of the current
randomized study was to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of docetaxel plus cisplatin
combination on 2 schedules in patients with previously untreated, advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. Consenting patients with advanced NSCLC were randomized to receive
first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1, plus 3-weekly (75 mg/m2
on Day 1) or weekly (35 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 4-week cycle) docetaxel, for
up to 6 cycles.

RESULTS. Of 86 patients accrued, 41 patients were treated with 3-weekly and 43 with
weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin. The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicity in the 3-weekly

arm was neutropenia (56% of patients). In those receiving the weekly regimen, the
frequent grade 3/4 toxicities were fatigue (44%) and nausea/vomiting (35%). The

overall response rate was 40% with the 3-weekly and 39% with the weekly arm
and 3.9 months in the weekly arm (P ¼ .08) and the median survival was 10.3 and
10.0 months, respectively (P ¼ .76). Quality of life data showed no relevant difference
between the arms.

CONCLUSIONS. The weekly schedule of docetaxel plus cisplatin combination as firstline chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, while feasible, has no clear advantage over
the standard 3-weekly regimen. Cancer 2007;109:732–40.

he benefit of palliative chemotherapy for advanced nonsmall-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the leading cause of cancer-related
death in Korea,1 is established.2 A number of randomized studies and
meta-analyses have reported that cisplatin-based chemotherapy produces modest but significantly improved survival with better quality
of life (QOL) compared with that of supportive care alone.2,3 As a
result, current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines have established 2-drug combination chemotherapy regimens as
the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC.4 Although
treatment options for NSCLC have expanded in recent years to
include newer-generation agents such as vinorelbine, gemcitabine,
paclitaxel, or docetaxel, the efficacy of platinum-based doublet therapy appears to have reached a therapeutic plateau, with a median survival of 8 to 10 months seen in patients with advanced disease.5,6
In the TAX 326 study,7 which included chemotherapy-naive
patients with advanced NSCLC, a combination of docetaxel and

cisplatin significantly improved overall survival (OS)
compared with a combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin combination (11.3 vs 10.1 months; P ¼ .044) as
first-line therapy. This led to the current use of docetaxel and cisplatin combination as one of the most important first-line chemotherapy regimens. Although
initial Phase I studies suggested that docetaxel administered on a weekly basis was effective with low toxicity at
doses up to 45 mg/m2,8,9 the combination of docetaxel
75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 60–80 mg/m2 administered
every 3 weeks is now one of the most commonly used
regimens for the first-line treatment of advanced
NSCLC.
Although the 3-weekly regimen is active and tolerated, it is associated with a significant incidence of
severe neutropenia, often complicated by fever. Therefore, there has been increasing interest in the use of a
weekly administration of docetaxel as a way of reducing
its hematologic toxicity. In a Phase I study evaluating
weekly docetaxel,9 significant alteration in the toxicity
profile was observed, with fatigue being the dose-limiting toxicity. Myelosuppression was generally mild and
severe neutropenia was uncommon. This altered toxicity profile suggested a potential for better tolerance and
increased dose intensity, which was supported by
recent randomized studies performed in a second-line
setting.10–12
Likewise, weekly regimens of docetaxel in combination with cisplatin were developed in an attempt to
increase the therapeutic index of this treatment when
used for advanced NSCLC.13–15 In the first-line setting,
most studies undertaken to date have been Phase II studies.16–19 Weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin produced
minimal myelosuppression and showed activity in the
treatment of chemotherapy-naive patients with NSCLC.
Given the promising results, we designed the current
randomized Phase II study in order to evaluate the
safety profile and antitumor activity of two different
schedules of docetaxel plus cisplatin given as first-line
therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
For this single-center randomized Phase II study, eligible patients had histologically or cytologically confirmed AJCC stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Other inclusion criteria
were as follows: age less than 75 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2
or less; at least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion or
evaluable indicator lesion; adequate baseline bone
marrow functions (neutrophil count >1,500/mm3
and platelet count >100,000/mm3); normal hepatic
(aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/alanine transaminase

733

[ALT] 2.5 upper limit of normal [ULN], bilirubin
1.5 mg/dL) and renal (creatinine clearance 60 mL/
min or serum creatinine ULN) functions; and the provision of a signed written informed consent. Patients
were only enrolled if they had no prior chemotherapy,
or if prior therapy consisted of adjuvant chemotherapy
that had been completed more than 6 months before
study entry. Patients were excluded from the study if
they had severe comorbid illness, known history of anaphylaxis of any origin, or a history of other primary
tumors except adequately treated in situ carcinoma of
the uterine cervix and basal or squamous cell skin cancer. All registered patients were mentally capable of
understanding the diagnosis and nature of the study.
This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the
Gil Medical Center (Incheon, Korea) Institutional
Review Board.
Patients were stratified according to their performance status (0–1 vs 2) and were randomly assigned to
receive either 3-weekly or weekly docetaxel, in addition
to cisplatin 75 mg/m2 after adequate hydration on Day
1. The 3-weekly arm received 3-week cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion on Day 1. Patients
randomized to the weekly arm received 4-week cycles
of docetaxel 35 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15. In both
arms premedications included adequate antiemetic
therapy and dexamethasone before each docetaxel
infusion (15 mg given at 12, 0 and þ12 hours of every
docetaxel administration in the 3-weekly arm and at
0 hour in the weekly arm). Chemotherapy was administered for up to 6 cycles unless there was documented
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient
refusal. Second-line treatments were permitted at the
investigators’ discretion and the nature of any secondline treatments was recorded.
Dose adjustments at the start of a new cycle were
based on the worst toxicity observed during the previous cycle. For hematologic toxicity, subsequent cycles
were delayed for up to 2 weeks if grade 2 toxicities
appeared. The dose of docetaxel was reduced if grade 4
myelosuppression or febrile neutropenia was present,
and if myelosuppression or febrile neutropenia persisted an additional reduction of docetaxel dose was
required. If there was a third such episode docetaxel
was discontinued. In the case of grade 2 nonhematologic toxicity, treatment was delayed until recovery but
not for more than 2 weeks. The dose was reduced in the
case of severe nonhematologic toxicity that was not
controllable with usual measures, and treatment was
discontinued if the patient experienced a significant
hypersensitivity reaction or unacceptable toxicity (eg,
grade 4 stomatitis or diarrhea, grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, severe and persistent skin/nail changes). On
the weekly arm, docetaxel administration could be

omitted if 1 of the following toxicities was noted on Day
8 or Day 15: grade 2 hematologic or nonhematologic
toxicities, fever 388C, diarrhea of any grade, or a
decreased performance status. Dose adjustment criteria
for cisplatin were based on creatinine clearance, which
was calculated before the beginning of each cycle, and
neuropathy. The dose of cisplatin could be reduced for
a reversible decrease of creatinine clearance. Cisplatin
was also reduced if grade 2 neuropathy appeared.
The use of hematopoietic growth factors was not
allowed during treatment, except for patients with febrile neutropenia or grade 4 myelosuppression at the
investigators’ discretion.

Efficacy and Safety Analyses
Baseline evaluation included a complete medical history, a physical examination, complete blood counts
and serum chemistry, chest x-ray, computed tomography of the thorax and upper abdomen, and measurement of the measurable lesion(s). Safety evaluations,
including the clinical assessment of any adverse events
and laboratory tests, were performed before the start of
subsequent cycles. In the weekly arm, clinical adverse
events and blood counts were checked on Day 15.
Objective tumor response was evaluated before every
second cycle and graded using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Patients who showed a complete
or partial response were reassessed at least 4 weeks
later for confirmation of clinical response. All tumor
measurements were recorded in millimeters by a pulmonary radiologist, with 2 dimensions in all measurable lesions. If the patient had only evaluable lesion,
response was classified as complete response, stable
disease, or progressive disease. Progression in nonmeasurable lesions that led to deterioration of the patient’s
status was classified as progressive disease, regardless
of the status of the measurable lesions. Toxicities were
evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute
criteria (NCI-CTCAE) v. 3. The worst grade of toxicity
occurred during the treatment was computed for each
patient.
QOL was assessed using the validated Korean version of the European Organisation of Research and
Treatment of Cancer questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30),
which contains 30 questions addressing various aspects
of QOL.20,21 This self-administered questionnaire was
completed by patients at baseline, every 2 cycles, and at
the end of treatment. QOL scores were descriptively
recorded as baseline values and changes from baseline.
As a general criterion for a clinically significant
improvement or deterioration, we defined a difference
of 10 or more from baseline mean score as a clinically
significant change.

Statistical Consideration
The objective of this study was to determine whether
the weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin combination warranted further evaluation in a larger trial. Thus, this randomized Phase II study was treated for statistical
purposes as 2 simultaneous Phase II studies and the
Fleming’s 1-stage design was applied separately for
each treatment arm. Within each treatment arm the
design was based on a test of a null hypothesis of 30%
versus an alternative of 50%. With a significance level
and power set at 0.1, 39 patients per arm were required.
The primary endpoint was to estimate the response
rate to the given regimens, particularly to the weekly
arm. A chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables, and QOL differences between treatment arms were calculated with paired t-tests.
Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were estimated
according to the Kaplan-Meier method and the statistical significance of survival curves between the 2 arms

RESULTS
A total of 86 patients were entered in this study between
January 2004 and December 2005: 42 in the 3-weekly
arm and 44 in the weekly arm. One patient assigned to
each arm did not receive protocol therapy because of
the rapid deterioration of their general condition. However, in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis the patients
were included in the denominator for treatment outcomes. Clinical characteristics were available for all
patients and are listed in Table 1. Because of the stratification by their performance status, baseline characteristics are well balanced between the 2 arms. A majority
of patients (73%) had stage IV disease.

Toxicity and Treatment Exposure
There was no significant difference in the number of
chemotherapy cycles, with 153 cycles (median, 4; range,
1–6) given to patients in the 3-weekly arm and 144
cycles (median, 3; range 1–6) to the weekly arm
(P ¼ .37). Of the 84 patients who started treatment, 12
patients (29%) in the 3-weekly arm and 6 patients (14%)
in the weekly arm completed 6 planned cycles. Other

was 17 (11%). In the weekly arm, treatment delays were
required in 15 patients and affected 21 (15%) cycles.
Patients treated with the 3-weekly regimen had
a significantly higher incidence of thrombocytopenia
(P < .01) and neutropenia (P < .01) of any grade compared with the weekly arm patients. Conversely, patients
in the weekly arm experienced a significantly higher
incidence of anemia (P < .01), fatigue (P ¼ .04), peripheral neuropathy (P ¼ .03), skin toxicity (P ¼ .01), nail
changes (P ¼ .02), and lacrimation (P < .01) compared
with patients in the 3-weekly arm. There was no difference in the incidence of stomatitis, nausea/vomiting, or
peripheral edema. Diarrhea was noted in both arms, but
was more severe in patients receiving the weekly regimen. A summary of toxicities is presented in Tables 2
and 3.
The most frequent reasons for treatment delays
were neutropenia (for the 3-weekly arm) and fatigue
(weekly arm). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicity in
the 3-weekly arm was neutropenia (56% of patients)
and overall 17% developed febrile neutropenia. In those
receiving the weekly regimen, the most frequent grade 3
or 4 toxicities were fatigue (44%) and nausea/vomiting
(35%). Hematopoietic growth factor was administered
to 7 patients in the 3-weekly arm and to 1 patient in the
weekly arm. Severe skin/nail changes and excessive
lacrimation occurred almost exclusively in the weekly
arm. No patient died of toxicity during treatment.
For patients treated with 3-weekly docetaxel plus
cisplatin, the median dose intensity of docetaxel 24.3

mg/m2 per week corresponded to 97% of the scheduled
dose, and the median duration of therapy was 3.1
months. For patients treated with weekly regimen, 21%
of scheduled Day 15 docetaxel and 6% of Day 8 doses
were omitted because of nonhematologic toxicity, as
per the protocol criteria. Due to these skipped doses,
the median dose of docetaxel in the weekly arm was
only 23.1 mg/m2 per week, which corresponded to 88%
of the scheduled dose, and the median treatment duration was 2.6 months. Relative dose intensities of cisplatin were 97% for patients in the 3-weekly arm and 98%
for those in the weekly arm.

Efficacy
Treatment outcomes obtained in the study are summarized in Table 4. Disease control (objective response
and stable disease) in the ITT population was achieved
in 67% of patients in the 3-weekly arm and in 75% of
patients in the weekly arm, and the overall response
rate was 40% with the 3-weekly and 39% with the
weekly regimen (P ¼ .74). All responses occurred
between 39 and 83 days after the initiation of treatment.
At the time of analysis, 74% of the patients had died
and the median follow-up duration was 15.4 months.
The median PFS was 4.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5–6.1 months) in the 3-weekly arm and 3.9
months (95% CI: 3.1–4.7 months) in the weekly arm
(P ¼ .08; Fig. 1). Their median OS was 10.3 months
(95% CI: 7.3–13.3 months) and 10.0 months (95% CI:
8.7–11.3 months) in the 3-weekly and weekly arms,
respectively (P ¼ .76; Fig. 2). Multivariate analysis
revealed that only treatment arm (3-weekly vs weekly)
had a significant effect on the hazard of disease progression (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI: 0.33–0.88; P ¼ .01).
This effect did not, however, translate into OS benefit
(hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.37–1.34; P ¼ .28).

patients who were still alive (n ¼ 22) was 10.3 months.

Second-Line Treatment
Salvage treatment was not specified in the protocol.
Palliative radiotherapy was given to 12 patients with
symptomatic progression in lung, bone, or brain. We
offered second-line chemotherapy to 62 patients after
failure. For reasons that are unknown, more patients in
the weekly arm received second-line chemotherapy (23
patients in the 3-weekly arm vs 39 in the weekly arm).
Second-line therapy after docetaxel plus cisplatin was
mostly nonplatinum therapy: 22 patients (8 in the 3weekly arm vs 14 in the weekly arm, respectively)
received gemcitabine-based therapy, 9 patients (2 vs 7
patients in each arm, respectively) received irinotecan,
2 patients (in the weekly arm) received pemetrexed,
and 29 patients (13 vs 16 patients, respectively) were
treated with gefitinib or erlotinib. Nineteen patients
received third-line treatment.
Quality of Life
Baseline QOL questionnaires were completed by 66
(77%) patients: 31 in the 3-weekly arm and 35 in the
weekly arm (Table 5). The scores for the baseline QOL
were similar in both arms. The baseline highest score of
the symptoms scales was assigned to fatigue in both
arms, and this was neither improved nor deteriorated
after chemotherapy. Change in QOL was defined as the
difference between the baseline and mean score
reported for each subscale during and after chemotherapy. For both arms, the global QOL and functional
scores were unchanged from baseline. When we considered as significant a change of 10 or greater in any of
the symptoms scores, there was significant improvement in insomnia scores in the weekly arm. Nausea/
vomiting and appetite scores were worsened in both

posttreatment.

DISCUSSION
The primary objective of this study was to compare
weekly schedule with 3-weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin,
the standard first-line chemotherapy for patients with
advanced NSCLC. Both treatment schedules showed
similar response rates but had different toxicity profiles.
The most frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicities were neutropenia in the 3-weekly arm and fatigue in the weekly
arm. Of the 84 patients who started treatment, only 18
patients (12 patients in the 3-weekly arm and 6 patients
in the weekly arm) completed the 6 planned cycles. The
main reason for treatment discontinuation was toxicity
rather than progressive disease. The toxicity profiles
suggested that the weekly regimen might not have a significant impact on tolerability when compared with the
standard 3-weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin schedule.
Although the concept of weekly docetaxel administration was introduced as a way of reducing its hematologic toxicity, previous randomized studies comparing
weekly with 3-weekly docetaxel in the treatment of
NSCLC were mostly limited to the second-line setting.10–12 These studies showed similar efficacy and

improved tolerability with weekly docetaxel compared
with the 3-weekly regimen. In a Phase III study, Schuette et al12 concluded that weekly docetaxel at 35 mg/
m2 could be recommended as a feasible second-line
treatment option for patients with previously treated
NSCLC. However, they reported that more patients in
the weekly arm had to discontinue treatment due to
toxicity than did those in the 3-weekly arm (9.7% vs
12.4%). The median number of treatment cycles delivered was 4 and 2 for the 3-weekly and weekly arms,
respectively. Gridelli et al.11 focused on QOL issues and
found similar efficacy and some QOL advantages in
favor of a weekly treatment schedule. In contrast,
Camps et al.22 reported that both 3-weekly and weekly
docetaxel are effective and well-tolerated, but they concluded that in general there is no indication to recommend the weekly schedule. Another randomized Phase
II study, in which the relative dose intensity delivered
was similar for both treatment arms, reported similar
efficacy despite a higher rate of severe fatigue with the
weekly regimen.10
In our study a weekly docetaxel dose of 26 mg/m2/
week was employed, which was comparable to the dose
intensity of the standard 3-weekly docetaxel (25 mg/
m2/week). However, the true dose intensity of docetaxel
in the weekly arm was lower because weekly doses
were sometimes omitted due to nonhematologic toxicity. Differences between the 3-weekly and weekly regimens found in the present study are not due to an
uneven distribution of patient characteristics (Table 1)
or to the number of cycles given. The only bias was that
dose omission on Day 15, and even on Day 8, in the
weekly arm was necessary for some patients. This dose
omission resulted in reduced overall dose intensity for
weekly docetaxel. The median relative dose intensity
for docetaxel in the weekly arm was 88%, whereas in
the 3-weekly arm it was higher at 97%.
While there was no relevant difference in overall
survival between the 2 arms, it is worth considering the
possible role that salvage treatment could have had on
survival, and the administration of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors after treatment failure
could have influenced survival results. Thirty-one percent of the 3-weekly arm patients received EGFR inhibitors as second-line treatment, and in the weekly arm
36% received gefitinib or erlotinib. It is also possible
that the greater incidence of neutropenia in the 3weekly arm is associated with improved efficacy.23 A
previous investigation by Di Maio et al.24 demonstrated
that neutropenia during chemotherapy was associated
with increased survival of patients with advanced
NSCLC. In addition, differences in baseline factors
may have contributed to the different results. Current
ASCO guidelines recommend that second-line chemo-

therapy with docetaxel should be confined to patients
with adequate performance status,4 thus only patients
with a good performance status who had responded to
first-line treatment are candidates for second-line
chemotherapy. Possible selection of only patients who
were eligible for further treatment could influence outcome parameters in previously performed randomized
studies.
The overall response rate of 40% and the median
OS of 10.3 months obtained with the 3-weekly treatment schedule are consistent with those reported in
previous Phase III studies applying the same regimen.6,7,25 The comparison of both treatment schedules
revealed similar treatment outcomes. This was rather
unexpected, considering the results from earlier randomized studies performed in a second-line setting,10–12
and those from nonrandomized studies in first-line setting.16–19 One possible explanation might be the combination with cisplatin. Randomized studies have shown
that cisplatin-containing regimens are significantly
more toxic than those without cisplatin, due to excessive nonhematologic toxicity of cisplatin.26,27 A metaanalysis also demonstrated that combination chemotherapy increased toxicity significantly, including a 3.6fold increase in the risk of treatment-related death
compared with single-agent chemotherapy in patients
with NSCLC.28 Rather than indicating decreased nonhematologic toxicity of 3-weeks docetaxel plus cisplatin, the difference in toxicity profile is probably a
consequence of the combination with cisplatin, as the
incidence and severity of toxicities observed in the 3weekly arm are consistent with the known profiles of
standard 3-weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin combination. A randomized Phase II study performed in elderly
and/or poor performance patients with advanced
NSCLC showed that weekly docetaxel monotherapy
had equivalent efficacy but lower hematologic toxicity
than 3-weekly docetaxel.29 In the current study, that
more patients in the weekly arm experienced severe
nonhematologic toxicity, leading to Day 15 dose omission, makes this a likely explanation. Moreover, severe
(grade 3) skin/nail changes and excessive lacrimation
occurred almost exclusively in the weekly arm. These
chronic toxicities that develop and increase with successive treatment were more prominent with weekly
dosing. It is also noteworthy that the latest version of
NCI-CTCAE (v. 3) includes grade 3 nail changes,
whereas in version 2 the rating scale extended only up
to grade 2. It is likely that previously reported severities
of nail changes were underestimated because of the
lack of more specific rating.
Our study is limited in that we performed laboratory tests (ie, complete blood counts) once per chemotherapy cycle in the 3-weekly arm (on Day 1) and twice

in the weekly arm (on Days 1 and 15). Lower incidence
of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was in part due to the fact
that weekly blood counts were not done for the 3weekly arm. However, hematologic adverse events
including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were
observed more frequently in the 3-weekly arm. More
frequent evaluation of these hematologic parameters
would likely strengthen rather than weaken our results.
We found that the toxicity profiles for the 3-weekly arm
were generally consistent with those reported in other
Phase III studies.6,7
We designed the present study to test the hypothesis that weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin is better tolerated than chemotherapy every 3 weeks, especially in
the first-line setting. The underlying presumption with
a weekly schedule is that it can reduce toxicity and thus
allow intensification of the dose without increasing
adverse events. However, we find that the weekly schedule, while feasible, has no clear advantage over the
standard 3-weekly regimen. Chemotherapy given at
intervals of 3 weeks is more efficacious and convenient
for most patients, and we believe that this should
remain the standard first-line docetaxel schedule. The
weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin combination can only
be applied to specific patient population who are not
expected to tolerate certain toxicities such as febrile
neutropenia, including those with a poor performance
status, multiple comorbidities, or old age. Additionally,
modifications of the weekly regimen, such as docetaxel
35 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks, which is quite
similar to the actual dose intensity in the present study
and is more convenient, could affect the tolerability or
outcome in this setting.
