Abstract
Batracylin (8-aminoisoindolo [1,2-b]quinazolin-10(12H)-one;
NSC320846) is an investigational clinical anticancer agent.
Previous animal studies showed activity against solid tumors
and Adriamycin-resistant leukemia. We initially sought to test
the proposed Top2-mediated DNA cleavage activity of batracylin and identify potential biomarkers for activity. COMPARE
analysis in the NCI-60 cell lines showed batracylin activity to be
most closely related to the class of Top2 inhibitors. The 50%
growth inhibition (GI50) value for batracylin in HT29 colon
carcinoma cells was 10 Mmol/L. DNA-protein cross-links,
consistent with Top2 targeting, were measured by alkaline
elution. DNA single-strand breaks were also detected and
found to be protein associated. However, only a weak induction
of DNA double-strand breaks was observed. Because batracylin
induced almost exclusively DNA single-strand breaks, we tested
batracylin as a Top1 inhibitor. Batracylin exhibited both
Top1- and Top2A/B-mediated DNA cleavage in vitro and in
cells. The phosphorylation of histone (;-H2AX) was tested to
measure the extent of DNA damage. Kinetics of ;-H2AX ‘‘foci’’
showed early activation with low Mmol/L concentrations, thus
presenting a useful early biomarker of DNA damage. The halflife of ;-H2AX signal reversal after drug removal was
consistent with reversal of DNA-protein cross-links. The
persistence of the DNA-protein complexes induced by batracylin was markedly longer than by etoposide or camptothecin.
The phosphorylated DNA damage–responsive kinase, ataxia
telangiectasia mutated, was also found activated at sites of
;-H2AX. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase, Chk2, was only
weakly phosphorylated. Thus, batracylin is a dual Top1 and
Top2 inhibitor and ;-H2AX could be considered a biomarker
in the ongoing clinical trials. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9971–9]

Introduction
The DNA topoisomerase enzymes relax helical supercoiling
generated during transcription, replication, and chromatin remodeling (1). Topoisomerase I (Top1) transiently cleaves a single strand
of DNA, whereas topoisomerase II (Top2) cleaves double-stranded
DNA (2). Interfacial inhibitors of topoisomerases reversibly trap
these enzyme-DNA complexes, which become lethal lesions upon
encountering a replication fork (3). Agents that target topoisomerases are successfully used as anticancer drugs (4, 5).
However, drug resistance due to varying expressions of Top1 or

Top2 and prolonged treatment schedules due to rapid reversibility
of cleavage complexes impose serious therapeutic limitations (6, 7).
Batracylin [8-aminoisoindolo [1,2-b ]quinazolin-10(12H )-one;
NSC320846] is a solid tumor-active compound developed by the
Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer
Institute (NCI; refs. 8, 9). Given i.p., batracylin was shown to inhibit
tumor growth completely in 80% to 100% of mice with early-stage
colon adenocarcinomas (9). Previous animal model studies have
also shown s.c. and oral activity against solid tumors (implanted
colon adenocarcinomas and pancreas ductal carcinomas) and
Adriamycin-resistant P388 leukemia (9, 10). COMPARE analysis in
the NCI-60 anticancer screen panel of cell lines suggested
batracylin activity to be most closely related to the class of Top2
inhibitors (11–13).3 The overall dose-response curves revealed that
the leukemia subpanel was most sensitive, with 50% growth
inhibition of six leukemia cell lines ranging from 0.2 to 14.7 Amol/L.
The colon cancer subpanel was ranked second most sensitive with
GI50 between 4 and 15.8 Amol/L. Batracylin presents a promising
agent because no correlation was found between drug sensitivity
and activity of P-glycoprotein efflux pump [multidrug resistance
(MDR) activity], as is seen for many MDR substrates (14).
Batracylin is undergoing evaluation as an anticancer agent at the
NCI in patients. We therefore proposed to test the use of potential
biomarkers of its DNA-directed actions. Members of the DNA
damage response pathway are among the first responders to
genomic alterations produced by topoisomerase-targeting agents.
The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, a member of the
PIKK family, is autophosphorylated on serine 1981 and acts on
downstream substrates responsible for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest,
and apoptosis. Histone H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139,
termed g-H2AX, is one of the earliest markers of camptothecininduced replication-associated DNA double-strand breaks (DSB;
refs. 15, 16) and of etoposide (VP-16; ref. 17). g-H2AX is proposed to
anchor broken chromosomes together and recruit DNA repair
elements, including Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (18, 19). Another substrate
of ATM is the cell cycle–associated kinase, Chk2 (2, 20). The Chk2
kinase undergoes a cascade of autophosphorylation, including on
threonine 68, upon camptothecin-induced DNA damage (21).
In this report, we present results from our study on the
topoisomerase-directed mechanism of actions of batracylin. We
also present evidence for the use of phosphorylated histone
g-H2AX as a biomarker of its DNA damage.

Cell Culture and Drug or Ionizing Radiation Treatment
Human colon carcinoma HT29, HCT116, and MCF-7 cells were obtained
from the Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI. HCT116-p53–deficient
cells were obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD). MCF-7/VP cells were maintained in 4 Amol/L VP-16 during
culture. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37jC before experimental use. Cells grown in T75 flasks
were exposed to indicated doses of ionizing radiation from a 137Cs source in
a Mark I irradiator (J.L. Shepherd and Associates).

Colony Formation Assay
Cell survival was determined using a colony formation assay after
indicated treatments. HT-29 cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated
(in triplicate, 50/500/5,000 cells) on six-well, 60-mm sterile polystyrene
culture plates. The cells were maintained in 3 mL of culture medium and
incubated unperturbed for 10 days. Before colony counting, culture medium
was aspirated, and colonies were treated with 2 mL of fixation solution (50%
methanol, 5% acetic acid) for 1 h. After removal of fixation solution,
colonies were stained with 3 mL of Wright’s Giemsa stain (Sigma
Diagnostics) for 1 h. Colonies were counted manually.

Assessment of Cell Survival
Cytotoxicity of batracylin was assessed by the sulforhodamine B (SRB;
Sigma-Aldrich) assay as described previously (22). IC50 was calculated using
the software Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Data were obtained from at
least three independent experiments.

Alkaline Elution
DNA damage was detected using alkaline elution assays as described
previously (22, 23). HT29 cells were prelabeled with [3H]thymidine (1 ACi/
mL) for 72 h. Cells were chased overnight (16 h) with radioisotope-free
medium before receiving drug treatments. The cells were harvested after
specified incubations by scraping them into ice-cold HBSS.
Detection of DNA-protein cross-links and protein-associated strand
breaks. DNA-protein cross-links (DPC) and protein-associated strand
breaks were analyzed using DNA-denaturing (pH 12.1) alkaline elution
carried out under nondeproteinizing conditions as described previously (24).
Detection of DNA single-strand breaks. DNA single-strand breaks
(SSB) were analyzed using DNA-denaturing (pH 12.1) alkaline elution
carried out under deproteinizing conditions as reported previously (24).
Detection of DSBs. DSBs were analyzed using non–DNA-denaturing
(pH 9.6) elution carried out under deproteinizing conditions as described
previously (23, 25).

Immunocomplex of Top1-DNA Detection Assay
Top1-DNA adducts were detected as described previously (16, 26).
Briefly, 106 treated or untreated cells were pelleted and immediately lysed
in 1% sarkosyl. Following homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer and
pestle B, cell lysates were gently layered on cesium chloride step gradients
and centrifuged at 165,000  g for 20 h at 20jC. Half-milliliter fractions
were collected and the fractions 6 to 10 were pooled together. The pooled
fractions were then diluted with 25 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 6.5) to make a 1, 2, 4, or 8 scaled dilution for better resolution of
differences and applied to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) in a slotblot vacuum manifold. Top1-DNA complexes were detected using the C21
Top1 monoclonal antibody (gift from Yung-Chi Cheng, Yale University,
New Haven, CT) using standard Western blotting procedures. Top2a and
top2h antibodies were obtained from Abcam.

Confocal Microscopy of Nuclear Protein Localization,
Antibodies Used
Cells grown in Nunc chamber slides (Nalgene) using 0.5 mL of tissue
culture medium were fixed and permeabilized as described previously using
4% paraformaldehyde and ice-cold 70% ethanol (16). Nonspecific binding
was blocked using 8% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Fixed cells were
stained overnight with primary antibodies (in 1% BSA at 4jC) and tagged
with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room
temperature. Slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting liquid
(Vector Labs) and sealed. Immunofluorescence microscopy was done in a
Nikon Eclipse TE-300 confocal laser scanning microscope system. The
mouse anti–g-H2AX antibody was purchased from Upstate USA, Inc., and
the rabbit anti–g-H2AX antibody was obtained from Dr. William Bonner
(NCI). The phosphorylated S1981-ATM and phosphorylated T68-Chk2
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Images were
collected as tif files and processed with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems,
Inc.). Images were converted to black and white and ellipses were drawn
over the nuclear boundaries for clarity.

Results

Top1- and Top2-Induced DNA Cleavage Assays
Top-mediated reactions have been described previously (22). The 161-bp
fragment from pBluescript SK( ) phagemid DNA (Stratagene) was
3¶-end labeled with [a-32P]dGTP. For Top1 cleavage assays, labeled DNA
(50 fmol/reaction) was incubated with 5 ng of recombinant Top1 with or
without drug at 25jC in 10 AL reaction buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5),
50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, and 15 Ag/mL bovine
serum albumin (BSA), final concentrations]. Maxam Gilbert loading buffer
[3.3 volumes of 80% formamide, 10 mmol/L sodium hydroxide, 1 mmol/L
sodium EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromophenol blue (pH 8.0)]

was added to the reaction mixtures. Aliquots were separated in 16%
denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 mol/L urea) in 1 Tris-borate EDTA
(45 mmol/L Tris, 45 mmol/L boric acid, and 1 mmol/L EDTA) for 2 h at
40 V/cm at 50jC.
For Top2 assays, the same pSK fragment used for Top1 assays or singlestranded oligonucleotides were 5¶-end–labeled with [32P]ATP and T4
polynucleotide kinase. Labeling mixtures were subsequently centrifuged
through Mini Quick Spin DNA columns ( for pSK fragment) or Oligo columns
( for oligonucleotides; Roche Diagnostics) to remove the unincorporated
label. Annealing to the complementary strand of the oligonucleotides was
done by heating the reaction mixture to 95jC and overnight cooling to
room temperature in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mmol/L NaCl, and
1 mmol/L EDTA. DNA substrates (10 pmol/reaction) were incubated with
500 ng of Top2a or Top2h (kind gift from Dr. Neil Osheroff) in the presence
or absence of drugs for the indicated times at 25jC in 10 AL of reaction buffer
[10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L
ATP, 0.2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, and 15 Ag/mL BSA]. Reactions
were stopped by adding SDS ( final concentration 0.5%). Samples were
separated on 16% ( for pSK DNA) or 20% ( for the oligonucleotides)
denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 mol/L urea). Imaging and quantitation
were done using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).

Cytotoxicity profile of batracylin. Batracylin is a synthetic
heterocyclic amine (Fig. 1A, structure) that has advanced through
the NCI drug development program based on its anticancer
activity in mouse colon adenocarcinoma 38 and other tumor
models. Using a colony formation assay, we determined the IC50
of batracylin to be 10 Amol/L after a 6-h pulse exposure in the
human colon carcinoma cell line, HT29 (Fig. 1B). Figure 1C
shows the activity profile of batracylin in the NCI-60 panel of

human cancer cell lines using a SRB dye–based cell proliferation
assay. The colon cancer subset of cell lines was ranked second
most sensitive, after leukemic subset, with GI50 between 4.07 and
15.85 Amol/L. The mean value for concentration corresponding
to GI50 across all cell lines (MG_MID) was 4.4 Amol/L. COMPARE
analysis of batracylin has shown that its pattern of activity is
most closely related to that of the Top2-targeting family of drugs
(Supplementary Table S1). The sensitivity to batracylin did not
seem to be predictable based on the p53 status of these cells
from the NCI-60 panel. Thus, we confirmed the cytotoxicity of
batracylin in human cancer models and chose the colon
carcinoma cell line, HT29, to further analyze its topoisomerasedirected molecular mechanism.

Batracylin induces DPCs. As a consequence of the proposed
Top2-mediated actions of batracylin (11), we proposed that
exposure of HT29 cells would produce protein-associated DNA
breaks formed as a result of the Top2-DNA cleavage complexes
trapped by batracylin. To quantify the protein-associated DNA
breaks, we did alkaline elutions (23). Figure 2A shows that
treatment with 100 Amol/L of batracylin for 3 h produced DNA
SSB under deproteinizing conditions. In contrast, under nondeproteinizing alkaline elution conditions, no such breaks
were observed (Fig. 2A, right), which is consistent with induction
of topoisomerase cleavage complexes (23). A time course of
100 Amol/L batracylin revealed an increasing level of DPC
formation (Fig. 2B). The formation of DPC was concentration

dependent when measured at 3 h (Fig. 2C). As expected for
topoisomerase cleavage complexes (23), very low levels of proteinfree breaks were observed, and the formation of SSB was nearly
equivalent with the extent of DPC (Fig. 2C).
Formation of SSB or DSB by batracylin. Because batracylin
was known to induce Top2 cleavage complexes (11), we expected batracylin to produce both SSBs and DSBs (23). We used
pH-based alkaline elution assays to quantitate the extent of SSB
or DSB formation. Contrary to our expectation, batracylin was a
weak inducer of DSBs at 3 or 6 h even at concentrations up
to 300 Amol/L (Fig. 2D, left). The extent of clear DSB formation
by known Top2-targeting VP-16 was included in the analysis for
comparison. Under the same conditions, batracylin efficiently produced SSB within 3 h of exposure (Fig. 2D, right). Thus, batracylin
produced SSBs to a greater extent than DSBs, which is unusual for
a Top2 inhibitor (23, 25).
Topoisomerase-directed actions of batracylin. The favored
production of SSBs over DSBs by batracylin led us to hypothesize
that batracylin could be targeting Top1. Induction of DNA cleavage
in the presence of Top1 was tested using recombinant Top1 on a
purified DNA fragment (Fig. 3A; ref. 22). The cleavage sites
observed with camptothecin are indicated by arrows for comparison. Batracylin showed a DNA cleavage pattern distinct from the
known Top1-targeting drugs, camptothecin, and the indenoisoquinoline, MJ-III-65 (NSC 706744) (2). We also tested the actions of
batracylin on Top2a and Top2h. VP-16 (100 Amol/L) was used as a
positive control in these experiments. Shown in Fig. 3B, batracylin
exhibits extremely low Top2a inhibition compared with VP-16. We
found mainly Top2h-mediated DNA cleavage in the presence of
increasing concentrations of batracylin (Fig. 3C). Thus, batracylin is
a dual inhibitor of both Top1 and Top2h enzymes.
Batracylin induced Top1 and Top2 cleavage complexes
in vivo. Using the in vivo complex of enzyme (ICE) bioassay,
we measured in vivo trapping of Top1, Top2a, and Top2h
after batracylin treatment at 3 h in HT-29 cells. Camptothecin
(1 Amol/L) or VP-16 (100 Amol/L) were used as positive controls.
The pooled fractions were diluted as described in Materials and
Methods and probed for Top 1, Top2a, or Top2h. Batracylin at
100 and 300 Amol/L showed increased enzyme complexes at
3 h (Fig. 3D). The complex formation was most apparent for Top1.
Thus, batracylin exhibits in vivo trapping of both Top1 and Top2
enzymes.
Batracylin cell killing in cells deficient for p53 and Top1, or
resistant to VP-16. Loss in cellular viability by batracylin was
assayed using a SRB dye–based test (22). A dose-dependent
reduction in cell survival at 72 h was observed in HCT116 colon
carcinoma cells deficient or proficient for p53 (Fig. 4A), suggesting
a p53-independent mode of cell killing. MCF-7 breast cancer cells
stably transfected with Top1 siRNA (27) were partially resistant to
batracylin (f2.9-fold reduction in IC50 value). MCF-7 cells that are
resistant to VP-16 (MCF-7/VP; ref. 28) were 5.4-fold resistant to
batracylin compared with their sensitive parental cells. Thus,
batracylin displays a p53-independent but partially Top1- and
Top2-mediated cell killing.
Phosphorylated histone, ;-H2AX, as a biomarker of batracylin-induced DNA damage. We tested the phosphorylation of a
variant of histone H2A, termed g-H2AX, as a viable biomarker for
the early detection of DNA damage by batracylin. We analyzed
whether we would be able to detect nuclear aggregates (‘‘foci’’) of
g-H2AX before the earliest detection of DNA breaks that would be
indicative of DNA damage. In Fig. 5A, we used confocal microscopy

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

to detect the formation of g-H2AX foci with increasing concentrations of batracylin for 3 h. Doses as low as 1 Amol/L were able to
increase the number of cells that were positive for g-H2AX. VP-16
was included as a positive control and the time course of g-H2AX
formation in response to batracylin was determined. Figure 5B
shows distinct foci formation after 1 h of treatment. The signal for
g-H2AX seemed to increase with time up to 15 h.
The formation of g-H2AX has been associated with the kinase
activity of ATM, a large protein mutated in the disorder ataxia
telangiectasia (20, 29). ATM itself is autophosphorylated at S1981
(pS1981-ATM) and is emerging as yet another responsive element
to DNA damage (20, 29). We tested the formation of pS1981-ATM
along with g-H2AX and found an equivalent increase in nuclear
foci for pS1981-ATM with 3-h treatment of batracylin in HT29 cells
(Fig. 5C). The signal for g-H2AX seemed to colocalize with that of
pS1981-ATM. Additionally, we tested the phosphorylation of the
cell cycle checkpoint kinase, Chk2 (pT68-Chk2), a substrate of ATM
and other phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (30, 31). In Fig. 5D, we
observe weak induction of pT68-Chk2 compared with g-H2AX. The
pT68-Chk2 signal was also colocalized with g-H2AX.
Thus, g-H2AX could serve as a biomarker for early detection of
DNA damage by batracylin.
Slow reversibility of the DPCs and ;-H2AX foci induced by
batracylin. To ascertain the reversibility of DNA damage induced
by batracylin, we measured the reversal of g-H2AX after a 3-h
exposure to 10 Amol/L of drug. In Fig. 6A, we show persistence of
g-H2AX foci after 3-h incubation in drug-free medium. By 15 h,
most cells had returned to their untreated state for g-H2AX signal.
We then measured the stability of Top1- and Top2-DNA cleavage
complexes by alkaline elution. The reversal of DPC after batracylin
removal was found to be in agreement with g-H2AX disappearance
(Fig. 6B). The DPC reversal was compared with that of VP-16 and
observed to be significantly slower. The half-life of VP-16–induced
DPCs was within minutes (<30 min), whereas that of batracylin was
between 1 and 2 h. Thus, the reversibility of DNA damage by
batracylin was slower than for VP-16.

Discussion
Batracylin has advanced through the NCI drug development
pipeline based on its activity against colon carcinomas as well as
cisplatin- and doxorubicin-resistant tumors. Initial studies had
suggested its mechanism to be Top2 targeted (Supplementary
Table S1; refs. 11–13). We aimed to perform preclinical studies to
test the activity of batracylin on topoisomerases and the DNA
damage it caused, as well as provide evidence for a viable
biomarker for its DNA-damaging activity. Current anticancer
therapy with topoisomerase-directed agents is limited by drug
resistance as well as long treatment schedules to overcome
reversibility of cleavage complexes. Therefore, we also questioned
whether batracylin would present an advantageous option based
on its mechanism of action. Previous studies have already indicated
that batracylin sensitivity did not correlate with MDR activity (14).
Thus, batracylin could present alternative therapy against doxorubicin- or cisplatin-resistant tumors.
The topoisomerase-directed actions of batracylin. We
confirmed the toxicity of batracylin in colon carcinoma cell line
HT29 by colony formation assay and provided evidence for a dosedependent cell killing (Fig. 1). The COMPARE algorithm was used
to analyze sensitivity patterns in the NCI-60 human tumor cell line
panel, and activity of batracylin was most comparable with the

Rad equivalents corresponds to about one
lesion per 106 nucleotides. D, representative
alkaline elution experiments show the extent
of DSB (left ) and SSB (right ). Following
batracylin treatments, the same cell culture
was divided into two fractions, one for DSB
and one for SSB. DSB and SSB experiments
were done under non-DNA denaturing (pH 9.6)
and DNA-denaturing conditions (pH 12.1),
respectively. Cells were exposed to
100 Amol/L (y) or 300 Amol/L (E) of batracylin
for 6 h followed by alkaline elution. VP-16
(10 Amol/L, n) and 50 Gy ionizing radiation (*)
were used for comparison. The weak induction
of DSB at 3 h (5) by batracylin is included
for comparison. For SSB analysis, the cells
were the same as for the DSB except for the
irradiated cells that were exposed to 3 Gy (*).
The extent of DNA lesions is expressed as the
fraction of DNA remaining on the filter after
elution.

Top2 class of drugs. The Top2 inhibitory actions of batracylin were
hypothesized to reveal predominantly DSB in cells. However, when
alkaline elutions were done to measure DSB and SSB, we observed
almost none at 3 h under conditions where SSB were clearly
detected. Only a few DSB were detectable at longer times (6 h;
Fig. 2D). This led us to hypothesize that batracylin might be
targeting Top1 in addition to Top2. In the present study, we show
batracylin activity on both Top1- and Top2-mediated DNA cleavage

(Fig. 3A–C). Batracylin exhibited a unique cleavage pattern when
compared with VP-16 or camptothecin or VP-16, suggesting that
it might also target distinct genomic sites. These DNA breaks
observed were protein associated because no significant breaks
could be measured in the presence of proteinase K (Fig. 2A). Also,
we present evidence for increasing DPCs after batracylin exposure
with time and increasing concentration (Fig. 2B). Thus, batracylin
seems to possess the properties of a dual topoisomerase inhibitor.

Figure 3. Batracylin is a dual Top1 and Top2 poison. A, DNA corresponding to the 3¶ end-labeled Pvu II/Hin dIII fragment of pBluescript SK( ) phagemid DNA
(pSK) was incubated with recombinant Top1 in the absence of drug (Top1) or presence of camptothecin, MJ-III-65, or increasing concentrations of batracylin
(10–300 Amol/L). Reactions were done at 30jC for 20 min and stopped by addition of 0.5% SDS. Arrows, migration positions of DNA fragments cleaved at the indicated
sites (sequence indicated to the right). B, to probe Top2a-mediated cleavage activity, the Pvu II/Hin dIII fragment of pBluescript SK( ) phagemid DNA (pSK) was
labeled at the 5¶ ends, and reactions were carried out with recombinant Top2a. VP-16 (100 Amol/L for 30 min) was included as a positive control. C, for testing
Top2h-mediated activity, recombinant Top2h was used in the reactions as above with increasing concentrations of batracylin or with VP-16. Arrows, the
batracylin-induced cleavage sites. D, cellular topoisomerase cleavage complexes were determined using the ICE bioassay at 3 h. Positive controls were 1 Amol/L
camptothecin for Top1 or 100 Amol/L VP-16 for Top2a and Top2h.

We confirmed the cellular activity of batracylin on Top1 and Top2
using the immunocomplex of enzyme assay (ref. 26; Fig. 3D). The
activity of batracylin was only partially diminished in Top1deficient or VP-16–resistant cells, confirming the redundancy of the
topoisomerase targeting (Fig. 4). The varying expression level of

Top1 and Top2 in cancer cells treated with a selective inhibitor can
potentially be overcome by use of a dual inhibitor such as
batracylin. Thus, batracylin seems to be a nonclassic topoisomerase inhibitor. It belongs to the group of dual topoisomerase
inhibitors. A limited number of dual topoisomerase inhibitors have

measure growth inhibition. Pairs of HCT116 (p53+/+ or p53 / ; A), siRNA-transfected MCF-7 (Top1 siRNA or control siRNA; B ), and MCF-7 (sensitive and VP-16
resistant; C ) were treated with increasing concentrations of batracylin and cell viability was measured after 72 h.

Topoisomerase Inhibition by Batracylin

Figure 5. g-H2AX foci as a cellular biomarker of DNA damage by batracylin. A, batracylin-treated HT29 cells were permeabilized and fixed for visualization of
microscopic foci by histone g-H2AX. Images were converted to gray scale and nuclear boundaries are indicated by white ellipses for clarity. Kinetics of concentration
response are shown in representative images. B, HT-29 cells were exposed for various times to batracylin at 10 Amol/L. VP-16 at 20 Amol/L for 3 h was used as a
reference. Representative images. C, phosphorylation of ATM kinase (pS1981-ATM) and colocalization with g-H2AX. HT-29 cells exposed to 1 Amol/L batracylin
for 6 h were co-stained with antibodies against g-H2AX and pATM-S1981. Inset, single enlarged nuclei representative of colocalization. D, batracylin also induces

been identified and some are being developed as anticancer agents.
These include the anthracycline-like anthraquinone saintopin,
indenoquinolones (TAS-103), quaternary alkaloids ( fagaronine),
the indolocarbazole NB-506, GA3P polysaccharide, the acridine
DACA and pyrazoloacridine, the pyridoindole intoplicin, XR5944,
and the homocamptothecin derivative BN-80297 (32–40). The
DPCs produced by batracylin had a significantly longer half-life
than those induced by VP-16 (Fig. 6) and camptothecin (data not
shown; ref. 41). Hence, similar to the bisindenoisoquinolines (22),
batracylin has an advantage of producing cleavage complexes with
slower reversibility than conventional topoisomerase-targeting
drugs that require longer treatment schedules. Only a few dual
topoisomerase inhibitors have been identified and are being
developed as anticancer agents (42, 43). Further preclinical studies
on batracylin are therefore warranted to evaluate its clinical
potential.
Histone ;-H2AX as a biomarker of the DNA damage by
batracylin. We have previously presented g-H2AX as an experimental biomarker of replication-mediated DNA damage by
anticancer agents (16, 22). Phosphorylation of histone H2AX
occurs rapidly after replication stress and can be readily detected

www.aacrjournals.org

by microscopic analysis of the nuclear foci that appears after
fluorescent antibody staining (44). The phosphorylation of H2AX is
mediated, among other kinases, by the ATM kinase. We show clear
increase in g-H2AX foci formation along with an increased
colocalized signal for phosphorylated ATM and Chk2 (Fig. 5).
The g-H2AX signals are within similar dose range as the
antiproliferative activity of batracylin, as indicated in Fig. 4. Lower
doses of batracylin used for these microscopic analyses of g-H2AX
are indicative of the high sensitivity of this assay (15, 45, 46). Pilot
studies, including those from our group, with surgical tissue
specimens and cell lines have shown that the g-H2AX foci are
present at higher levels in cancerous samples when compared with
normal tissue of the same origin (15, 44, 47). These foci are
suggested to be indicative of aggressive replication stress–mediated
genomic instability in these cells. The early detection of such foci is
an early hallmark of DNA damage caused by batracylin and similar
to other replication stress models likely signals for the concentration of DNA repair factors at the lesion sites (45, 48). Efforts are
under way to characterize the low basal level of g-H2AX foci in
various cancer models (44). An increase in g-H2AX foci signal is
being tested in the clinic as a biomarker of increased DNA damage

Figure 6. Reversal of DNA damage by
batracylin. A, reversal of g-H2AX foci in
HT-29 cells after 3-h treatment with 10 Amol/L
batracylin. Cells were analyzed at 1, 3, or
6 h after treatment. Images were converted
to gray scale and nuclear boundaries were
indicated by white ellipses for clarity. B,

by ionizing radiation (49) and computed tomography examination
(50). The slower rate of reversal of DPCs by batracylin was in
agreement with the rate of reversal of g-H2AX foci after drug
removal (Fig. 6). Consequently, batracylin caused DNA damage
after topoisomerase inhibition that was measured by alkaline
elution as well as g-H2AX foci formation. We have also previously
presented evidence for the use of g-H2AX in the measurement of
DNA damage by camptothecin, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, and
aminoflavone in cancer cell lines (14, 24, 25). Thus, g-H2AX
presents a sensitive biomarker of therapeutic efficacy of anticancer
drugs that could be readily measured in tissue biopsies or blood
cells. It would be most beneficial to use it in combination with

other biomarkers of disease progression during the upcoming
clinical trials of batracylin.
