ABSTRACT
mTORC1 is a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and an established
anticancer drug target. Aberrant mTORC1 signaling is common in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Rab1A is a newly
identified mTORC1 activator that mediates an alternative amino acid (AA) signaling
branch to Rag GTPases. Because liver is a physiological hub for nutrient sensing and
metabolic homeostasis, we investigated the possible role of Rab1A in HCC. We found
that Rab1A is frequently overexpressed in HCC, which enhances hyperactive AAmTORC1 signaling, promoting malignant growth and metastasis of HCC in vitro and in
vivo. Moreover, aberrant Rab1A expression is closely associated with poor prognosis.
Strikingly, aberrant Rab1A overexpression leads to increased rapamycin sensitivity,
indicating that inappropriate activation of AA signaling is a cancer-driving event in
HCC. Our findings further suggest that Rab1A is a valuable biomarker for prognosis
and personalized mTORC1-targeted therapy in liver cancer.

INTRODUCTION

high mortality rate, there is a pressing need to identify
key molecular events underlying the development of this
disease in order to improve diagnosis and therapy.
mTOR is a PI3K-related kinase conserved
throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. It forms two distinct
complexes named mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are
composed of the mTOR kinase subunit and accessory
proteins [6]. mTORC1, a master growth regulator and a
nutrient sensor, regulates growth-related processes such
as translation and ribosome biogenesis. mTORC2, on the
other hand, phosphorylates several AGC kinases including
AKT, to promote survival. Due to the central role of
mTORC1 in growth, aberrant mTORC1 signaling has been
linked to human diseases particularly cancer [7]. Because
many tumors are addictive to activated mTOR signaling,

HCC is the predominant form of liver cancer. It is
one of the most common malignancies in the world and the
third leading cause of cancer-related death [1, 2]. Although
HCC is most prevalent in East Asia, its incidence has seen
significant increase in North America and Western Europe
in recent years [3]. Due to lack of obvious symptoms and
reliable early detection methods, majority of the patients
are diagnosed at an advanced disease stage when there
are few curative options [4]. The pathogenesis of HCC is
thought to be due to a stepwise accumulation of mutations,
genomic aberrations and epigenetic changes, resulting in
alterations in the function of genes critical for growth,
proliferation, migration, and invasion [5]. Because of the

mTOR is a desirable target for molecular therapy.
Temsirolimus and everolimus, semisynthetic analogs of
the highly specific mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, are
FDA-approved drugs for advanced mammary and renal
carcinomas [8]. In addition, mTOR kinase inhibitors are
currently in many human cancer clinical trials [8].
mTOR activation promotes rapid cell growth
and proliferation [9, 10]. Recent studies indicate that
mTOR signaling is aberrantly activated in HCC [11,
12]. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is clinically used as an
immunosuppressant for liver transplantation after HCC
surgery [13]. Compared with FK506 (tacrolimus),
rapamycin-treated patients have significantly higher
recurrence-free survival [14-16]. It has been speculated
that rapamycin has the benefit of inhibiting graft rejection
while simultaneously preventing tumor recurrence. A
number of mTORC1-targeted HCC clinical trials have
been carried out (clinicaltrials.gov) [17]. However, mTOR
inhibitor as a single agent or in combination therapy has
achieved limited success to date [17]. Therefore, it is
of urgent need to investigate the mechanism of mTOR
activation and identify surrogate biomarkers.
mTORC1 is known to be downstream of
phosphatidylinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K). However,
recent evidence shows that oncogenic PI3K is often
insufficient to promote mTORC1 activity in colorectal
and breast cancer cells [18, 19], suggesting that other
events such as amino acid signaling are involved. We
have previously conducted a genomic rapamycin screen
for mTORC1 signaling pathway components in yeast [20],
and identified Rab1A, a small GTPase previously known
for its role in ER-to-Golgi trafficking, as a critical mediator
of AA signaling to activate mTORC1 [21]. In the present
study, we investigated Rab1A expression in HCC, and
found that it is frequently overexpressed in human primary
HCCs, which is correlated with poor prognosis. We further
studied the role of Rab1A in mTORC1 signaling and HCC
oncogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Rab1A is a new
oncogenic protein with potentially significant prognostic
and therapeutic values.

shows a strong correlation between genomic DNA copy
number and mRNA level of Rab1A (Figure 1A). To further
understand the molecular basis underlying aberrant Rab1A
expression, we examined mRNA and protein expression
of Rab1A in two immortalized liver (LO2 and QSG-7701)
and six HCC cell lines. Rab1A protein and mRNA levels
are both generally higher in HCC cell lines compared to
immortalized liver cell lines (Figure 1B and 1C). Rab1A
protein and mRNA levels are correlated, suggesting that
increased Rab1A is due to change in gene expression
(Figure 1D). These results indicate that HCC cell lines
resemble those seen with human tumors, and are useful
in vitro models for studying aberrant Rab1A expression.
Epigenetic alteration is another major cause of aberrant
gene expression in cancer. However, upon examination of
CpG island methylation of Rab1A promoter in two HCC
cell lines (MHCC97H and PLC/PRF/5) with high Rab1A
expression, and in two immortalized liver cell lines (LO2
and QSG-7701) with low Rab1A expression, we did not
find significant DNA methylation in any of the HCC cell
lines (Figure 1E and 1F), suggesting that methylation does
not contributes significantly to aberrant Rab1A expression.

Rab1A promotes oncogenic growth of HCC
Rab1A is important for AA to activate mTORC1,
a central regulator of cell growth. We investigated
the consequence of Rab1A overexpression by stably
expressing Rab1A in SK-HEP-1 and BEL-7402 (Figure
2A), two HCC cell lines with similarly low endogenous
Rab1A expression to immortalized liver cell lines LO2
and QSG-7701. Strikingly, moderate ectopic Rab1A
expression (~2-3-fold of endogenous Rab1A) is sufficient
to robustly increase the rate of colony formation and cell
growth compared with control cells (Figure 2B and 2C).
In xenograft mouse models established by injecting SKHEP-1-Rab1A or BEL-7402-Rab1A cells into the right
dorsal flanks and subcutaneously vector control cells into
the left dorsal flank of the same animals, tumor burden
with Rab1A overexpression is significantly larger than
control tumors (Figure 2D). IHC staining reveals that
Rab1A-overexpressing tumors have higher cell density,
mitotic index and nuclear variability, indicating that these
tumors are more malignant than control tumors (Figure
2E). Our results demonstrate that Rab1A overexpression
promotes oncogenic growth and proliferation in vitro and
in vivo.

RESULTS
Rab1A is overexpressed in HCC cells, which is
due to gene amplification
Genome data from two previous studies deposited
in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) suggest that
Rab1A gene is amplified in many HCC cases (http://
cancergenome.nih.gov) [22, 23]. We therefore examined
the relationship between the Rab1A copy number and
mRNA expression in 187 HCC samples available in the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer genomic database
(http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). Linear regression analysis

Rab1A promotes HCC cell migration, invasiveness
and metastasis
Intriguingly, Rab1A expression is nearly 3 times
higher in the metastatic cell line MHCC97H than the
paired non-metastatic cell line MHCC97L from the
same patient (Figure 1B and 1C), suggesting that Rab1A

the effect of Rab1A overexpression on HCC cell migration

and invasion. Indeed, Rab1A-overexpressing SK-HEP-1
and BEL-7402 cells migrate faster and are more invasive

nodules are found on the surface of the lung in Rab1Aoverexpressing HCC cells than the control (Figure 3C and

larger than the control (Figure 3E). These observations
indicate that Rab1A overexpression promotes HCC
migration, invasion and metastasis.

sections of the same HCC tissue. In support of a key role
for Rab1A in activation of mTORC1 signaling in liver
cancer, Rab1A expression in HCC tissues is generally
correlated closely with the level of P-S6K (Figure 5A). To
further investigate this phenomenon, we modulated Rab1A
expression in HCC cell lines. Overexpression of Rab1A in
SK-HEP-1 cells and BEL-7402 cells, two HCC cell lines
with low endogenous Rab1A, causes a significant increase
in mTORC1 signaling, as determined by phosphorylation
of S6K (Figure 5B). In contrast, phosphorylation of AKT,
a substrate of mTORC2 is not affected. Additionally,
phosphorylation of ERK, another major mitogenic kinase,
remains unchanged. Conversely, Rab1A knockdown in
MHCC97H and PLC/PRF/5 cells, two HCC cell lines
with high endogenous Rab1A, attenuates mTORC1
signaling, but not mTORC2 or ERK signaling (Figure
5C). These results indicate that Rab1A is an activator of
mTORC1 signaling in HCC. To determine whether the
hyper-activation of mTORC1 signaling is important for
the oncogenic activity of Rab1A, Rab1A-overexpressing
SK-HEP-1 cells were treated with rapamycin. Rapamycin
blunts Rab1A-stimulated mTORC1 signaling and HCC
cell growth (Figure 5D and 5E). This result indicates that
activation of mTORC1 signaling is critically important for
Rab1A to promote the oncogenic growth of HCC and that
Rab1A-stimulated growth is sensitive to the anticancer
drug rapamycin.

To further investigate the importance of Rab1A
overexpression in HCC, we knocked down Rab1A with
lentiviral shRNA in MHCC97H and PLC/PRF/5 (Figure
4A), two HCC cell lines with high Rab1A expression.
Rab1A knockdown significantly inhibits their growth and
colony formation (Figure 4B and 4C). We also generated
xenograft tumors in nude mice with MHCC97H stably
expressing a previously validated Rab1A shRNA or
a scrambled control shRNA by injecting HCC cells
subcutaneously into the left and right dorsal flanks of
athymic nude mice. Rab1A knockdown attenuates the
growth of the xenograft tumors compared with control
tumors (Figure 4D). Consistently, Rab1A-knockdown
tumors also display diminished proliferation as measured
by lower Ki67 staining (Figure 4E). Moreover, inhibition
of Rab1A expression leads to much reduced cell
invasiveness (Figure 4F). These data show that Rab1A is
required for malignant growth, proliferation and invasion
of HCC cells.

curve, we defined IHC score 120 as cutoff value to
distinguish Rab1A expression level (Figure 7A). There
is no statistically significant correlation between Rab1A
high expression and clinicopathological features such as
age, gender, tumor diameter, pathological stage, hepatitis
B virus infection, recurrence, TNM stage (Table 1).
Kaplan-Meier analysis reveals that overall survival of
HCC patients with high Rab1A expression is significantly
worse than those with low Rab1A expression in cohorts
I and II (Figure 7B and 7C). Furthermore, high Rab1A
expression correlates with poor prognosis at all three TNM
stages (Figure 7D) in cohort I. Thus, Rab1A level can
provide predictive value for the outcome of HCC patients.
The relationship between Rab1A expression and overall
survival of HCC patents was validated in cohort II (Figure
7E). Univariate Cox regression analysis further supports
the finding that Rab1A overexpression is significantly
associated with an elevated risk of HCC-related death
(Table 1). The relative risk (RR) of high Rab1A expression
was 7.863, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging
from 3.128-19.768 (p < 0.001) in cohort I. To adjust for
potential confounding factors, multivariate Cox regression
was performed on all variables (Table 1). The results
show that Rab1A expression is an independent prognostic
factor for HCC patients (Table 1). Analysis of the results
in cohort II leads to the same conclusion. These results
robustly demonstrate that Rab1A is an independent
prognostic predictor of poor survival in patients with
HCC. As expected, the TNM stage and recurrence are also
independent prognostic indicators for HCC patient (Table
2).

mTORC1 is an evolutionarily conserved nutrient
sensor whose activity is regulated by AA sufficiency.
To ask if Rab1A regulates mTORC1 signaling in HCC,
we examined the dependency of mTORC1 activation on
Rab1A by AA. We found that overexpression of Rab1A
strongly potentiate the ability of AA to activate mTORC1
as shown by much enhanced S6K1 phosphorylation
in SK-HEP-1 cells (Figure 5F). On the other hand,
Rab1A knockdown blunts the ability of AA to stimulate
phosphorylation of S6K1 in MHCC97H cells (Figure
5G). These observations demonstrate that Rab1A is
essential for mTORC1 activation by AA and that Rab1A
overexpression leads to hyperactive AA-mTORC1
signaling in HCC. Taken together, our data suggest that
increased Rab1A expression promotes tumorigenesis and
metastasis in HCC through activation of AA-dependent
mTOR signal transduction.

Rab1A is overexpressed in human primary HCCs
To investigate the clinical significance of Rab1A
expression in HCC, we analyzed its expression by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 143 paired primary HCC
and adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues from South
China (Guangzhou) (Cohort I). The data shows that
Rab1A expression is significantly up-regulated in tumors
compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (Figure
6A and 6B). To verify the result in a second, independent
cohort, we further examined 90 paired primary HCC and
adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues from East China
(Shanghai) (cohort II). Essentially the same result is
seen with Cohort II (Figure 6C). We further performed
an immunoblot analysis of 8 randomly selected pairs of
HCC and matching adjacent normal liver tissues. Rab1A
protein expression in HCC is higher in seven out of eight
cases after adjusting against the GAPDH loading control,
confirming the IHC staining results (Figure 6D). In
addition, we found that Rab1A mRNA is also increased
in 225 HCC samples versus 220 normal liver tissues by
analysis of an Oncomine mRNA expression profile, which
represents yet another independent source of samples
(Figure 6E). Together, these findings demonstrate that
Rab1A is frequently overexpressed in HCC.

DISCUSSION
Rab1A is a small GTPase well known for its role
in regulating ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport [24].
Although it is generally thought to be a housekeeping
enzyme, recent evidence indicates that Rab1A is closely
linked to human diseases. For example, Rab1A is critical
for infection by the pathogen Legionella pneumophila
[25, 26]. A DNA microarray study in a murine dilated
cardiomyopathy model identified Rab1A as one of the
highly induced genes during disease progression [27].
In the same study, Rab1A transgene is shown to cause
cardiac hypertrophy in a gene dosage-dependent manner
[27]. Another microarray expression profiling of human
tongue squamous carcinomas finds that Rab1A is highly
expressed in tongue cancer [28], although the significance
of Rab1A overexpression in this particular malignancy
remains unknown. The last two studies indicate that
aberrant Rab1A expression is closely associated with
hyper-proliferative diseases. However, it remains unclear
whether Rab1A is overexpressed in common human
cancers, and if so, what the significance and mechanism of
Rab1A overexpression are in the pathobiology of cancer.

AA signaling to activate mTORC1 independently of Rag
GTPases [29, 30]. It is anchored in the ER and Golgi
apparatus, instead of lysosomes for Rag GTPases, which
is consistent with that mTOR is found in these organelles
in many different types of cancer cells [31, 32]. Our results
demonstrate that aberrant AA signaling is a cancer-driving
event for common malignancies such as colorectal and

liver cancers.

in HCC is correlated closely with the increased Rab1A
DNA copy number. In contrast, no significant Rab1A
promoter methylation is associated with HCC, indicating
that Rab1A overexpression in HCC primarily results
from gene amplification. When overexpressed, Rab1A
promotes oncogenic growth, invasion and metastasis
of HCC cells. Conversely, down-regulation of Rab1A
attenuates these malignant phenotypes of HCC. Thus
Rab1A acts as an oncogene to promote malignant liver cell
growth and metastasis. These observations further suggest
that activation of AA signaling can promote both cancer
growth and metastasis.
mTORC1 is a master regulator of cell growth and
metabolism in response to nutrient signals, particularly
AAs. AAs are essential nutrients that serve as precursors
for protein synthesis and for other catabolism. In recent
years, it is increasingly recognized that AAs are also
important mitogenic signals stimulating cellular growth
and metabolism. Rag small GTPases have previously
been shown to be mediators of AA signaling [33,
34]. However, we found that AAs are still capable of
activating mTORC1 in the absence of Rag GTPases in
yeast and human embryonic kidney cells, and this Ragindependent mechanism is dependent on Rab1A [21]. Here
we show that Rab1A is also crucial for AA to stimulate
stimulate mTORC1 signaling in HCC. Importantly,
Rab1A overexpression enhances AA-mTORC1 signaling
in hepatocellular carcinomas, suggesting that aberrant AA
signaling is a main driving event for hepato-oncogenesis.
Because Rab1A overexpressing HCC cells are sensitive to
rapamycin, Rab1A can be potentially used as a surrogate
biomarker to guide personalized, mTORC1-targeted HCC
therapy. Further study of Rab1A should have considerable
basic and translational significance.

SK-HEP-1, and immortalized hepatic epithelial cell line
LO2 were cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal bovine
serum.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate
total RNA. To quantify mRNA expression level in cells,
the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech) was used to
synthesize cDNA. The SYBR Green PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems) was then used for qPCR, which
was followed by detection with an ABI PRISM 7900
Sequence Detector and analysis with the ABI SDS
2.3 software (Applied Biosystems). Relative Rab1A
expression level (defined as fold change) was expressed
as 2−ΔCT (ΔCT = CTRab1A − CTGAPDH) and normalized to the
relative expression level detected in control cells. Each
sample was tested in triplicate. Primer sequences are listed
in Supplementary Table 1.

Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

For MSP assay, genomic DNA was extracted from
HCC cells with the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA underwent
bisulfite modification with the EZ DNA MethylationDirect Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Primer
sequences for bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) and
MSP were listed in Supplementary Table 1. BGS PCR
fragments were analyzed by Sanger sequencing method
(Invitrogen).

Patients and HCC samples
Two cohorts of archived de-identified specimens
were used in this research: Cohort I of 143 HCC
patients who did not receive preoperative radiotherapy
or chemotherapy was selected consecutively from the
surgical pathology archives of Sun Yat-Sen University
Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China) with a median followup of 48 months (Ranging from 4 to 111 months). These
patients underwent radical hepatectomy between 2005 and
2008. Cohort II of 90 HCC patients was obtained with
the same selection criteria from Zhong Shan Hospital
(Shanghai, China). These patients received radical
hepatectomy between 2007 and 2009, with a median
follow-up of 33 months (range: 2-80 months). All tumor
samples were analyzed by two experienced pathologists.
The overall survival time was calculated from the date

Plasmids and DNA transfection
Human Rab1A cDNA plasmids were described
previously [21]. Rab1A plasmid was transfected into SKHEP-1 and BEL7402 cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Stable Rab1A-expressing or control cell clones were
selected in culture medium containing G418 (Roche
Diagnostics) at a concentration of 300 µg/ml. Lentiviral

Oncotarget

Immunohistochemical staining (IHC)

containing short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting Rab1A
was purchased from Thermo Fisher and were used to
infect MHCC-97H and PLC/PRF/5 cells according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were also infected with
scrambled control shRNA as controls. Puromycin was
used to select stable clones.

The
standard
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex method was used for IHC staining. Briefly, after
tumor sections were deparaffinized, nonspecific binding
was blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min
and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with
3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 10 min. For antigen
retrieval, the slides were soaked in 10 mM citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) and boiled for 15 min in a microwave oven.
Tumor sections were then incubated in a 1:200 dilution
of Rab1A-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 4°C overnight in a humidified
chamber. After washing, tumor sections were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat
antibody (DakoCytomation, Carpentaria, CA) for 30
min at room temperature. 3,5-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
substrate was used for color development, followed by
Mayer’s hematoxylin counterstaining. For IHC score,
the percentage (0 -100%) of stained tumor cells was
multiplied by the intensity (0, 1, 2, or 3) to achieve a score
between 0 and 300.

Wound healing and transwell invasion assays
Cell mobility was measured by the scratch woundhealing assay. Briefly, HCC cells expressing Rab1A or
carrying the control vector were cultured in six-well plates
until confluence, and then scratched with a 10 µl pipette
tip. Cell migration images were captured at 0 hr and 48 hr
after scratching. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
Cell invasion assay was performed with BD BioCoat
Matrigel Invasion Chambers (Becton Dickinson Labware)
following manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were seeded
at proper number. The chambers were incubated for 16-18
h at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The upper surface of
the membrane was scrubbed carefully with a cotton swab
to remove the remaining cells and matrigel matrix. Cells
on the lower surface of the scrubbed membranes were
fixed with 100% methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal
violet. Five random fields were counted under the light
microscope.

Antibodies and immunoblot
Immunoblot was performed according to
previously described [35, 36]. Briefly, Protein lysates
were resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto a
polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore,
Billerica, MA), incubated with a primary antibody, and
then a secondary antibody. The signals were detected
using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (GE
Healthcare). Antibodies against GAPDH, P-S6K(T398),
S6K, P-AKT(S473), AKT, P-ERK(T202, Y204), andERK
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and
antibodies anti-Rab1A and anti-P-S6K(T398) for
Immunohistochemistry were purchased from Santa Cruz
and Abcam, respectively.

Analysis of Rab1A copy number
The cancer genomic databases Oncomine (https://
www.oncomine.org/) and The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA, http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) were used to
analyze Rab1A DNA copy number alteration and mRNA
expression in HCC. The website cBioPortal (http://
www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/index.do) was used to
download and analyze HCC data from TCGA.

Cell viability assay

AA starvation or stimulation assay

The cells were seeded at 1x103 cells per well in
96-well plates for the cell growth assay using the CCK-8
assay kit (Dojindo, Shanghai, China). All of the results are
expressed as the mean ± SD.

Amino acid starvation and stimulation assay were
performed according to the previous study [21].

Focus formation assay

Metastasis assay

Cells were plated in triplicate in 6-well plates to
form colonies for up to 2-4 weeks. The medium containing
selective antibiotics was replaced every 3-5 days. The
colonies were then stained with crystal violet and counted.
The results are expressed as mean ± SD.

All animal procedures were performed in
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (NIH publications Nos. 80-23, revised
1996) and the Institutional Ethical Guidelines for Animal
Experiments developed by Sun Yat-sen University. Four
groups of 6 mice were each given intravenous tail vein
injection with 2×106 cells. After 8 weeks of observation,
mice were sacrificed and tumor nodules on the lung
