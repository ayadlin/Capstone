BACKGROUND. To the authors’ knowledge, few studies exist demonstrating the
reliability of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy for high-grade sarcoma (HGS).

METHODS. In the current study, the authors reviewed their cytopathology database (March 2001 through January 2007) and identified all FNA cases diagnosed

with a male:female ratio of 1:1) had an FNA diagnosis of HGS, or had HGS and a
prior FNA diagnosis of another entity. Ten cases were nondiagnostic. Of the 97
remaining samples, 6 were diagnosed as something other than HGS (sensitivity
of 94%). The positive predictive value of an FNA diagnosis of HGS was 97% (88
of 91 cases). Fifty-four cases were diagnosed as HGS, not otherwise specified, 8
as myxofibrosarcoma, 8 as osteosarcoma, 5 as malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumor, 5 as leiomyosarcoma, 4 as Ewing sarcoma, 4 as liposarcoma, 2 as epithelioid sarcoma, and 1 as angiosarcoma. Approximately 71% of patients presented
with a primary tumor, 23% with disease recurrence, and 7% with metastasis. Sites
of disease included the lower extremity (59%), upper extremity (19%), trunk
(15%), groin (4%), and head and neck (4%). FNA diagnosis was confirmed histologically in 88% of cases, clinically in 7% of cases, and cytogenetically in 1% of
cases; 3% of cases had false-positive results and 1 patient was lost to follow-up.
Sixteen of 19 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on the FNA diagnosis alone.

CONCLUSIONS. A cytopathologic diagnosis of HGS was found to be accurate in 88
of 97 cases (91%) with follow-up. A FNA biopsy diagnosis of HGS appears to be
clinically reliable in a high percentage of cases when used in close conjunction
with the orthopedic team. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2007;111:491–8.  2007

oft tissue sarcomas are uncommon, with approximately 8000 to
9000 new cases diagnosed each year in the U.S.1,2 Because of
this, the consensus among orthopedists, surgical oncologists, and
medical oncologists is that these patients should be evaluated in tertiary care centers that are experienced in securing a correct diagnosis and in sarcoma management. The initial assessment of a soft
tissue mass includes diagnostic imaging and a variety of biopsy
techniques.1 Among the latter are core needle biopsy (CNB), incisional (open) biopsy, and, occasionally, excisional biopsy. Although
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy has been accepted for the evaluation of superficial mass lesions, its use in the arena of soft tissue
masses is controversial. Thus, many clinicians resist the idea

of requesting FNA when a sarcoma is clinically
suspected, let alone permit management based on
such a diagnosis.
Over the past several years, close collaboration
has existed between orthopedic oncologists and
pathologists in the study institution whereby FNA biopsy has become integral in the evaluation of
patients presenting with a palpable soft tissue mass.
After diagnostic imaging, it is among the first procedures to be performed in a patient presenting with a
soft tissue mass. One of the criticisms of soft tissue
FNA biopsy is that even if sarcoma is diagnosed,
grading is not provided. Therefore, to partially answer this question, we focused on a consecutive
sequence of patients treated over the past 6 years
who had undergone FNA biopsy of a soft tissue
mass, had a diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma (HGS)
of any subtype issued based on the FNA, and had
clinical or histologic follow-up. Our goal was to
determine whether FNA biopsy was capable of making an accurate diagnosis of HGS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Case Selection and Grading
We reviewed our cytopathology files for all FNA cases
of soft tissue masses diagnosed as HGS (or neoplasms that by definition would be categorized as
HGS) between March 2001 and January 2007 in accordance with the approved Ohio State University
Institutional Review Board application #2002H0089.
This included bone sarcomas presenting as palpable
soft tissue masses. There were no cases of gastrointestinal or retroperitoneal HGS. Our surgical pathology files were also searched for any examples of HGS
cases with a prior FNA to capture any false-negative
cases. The majority of cases that were graded generically as HGS were done so using overall cellularity
and cellular pleomorphism, and were typically diagnosed as ‘‘pleomorphic sarcoma, high-grade.’’ Specific subtyping of HGS was accomplished either
because the mass was recurrent or metastatic and
the primary tissue diagnosis was known, ancillary
testing such as immunohistology on a cell block or
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed, or, in the case of bone neoplasms, specific
knowledge of the bone imaging was known.
FNA Technique
Percutaneous FNA biopsy was performed using a
standard technique with 21-gauge or 22-gauge, 1.5inch or 2-inch long needles. A single pathologist performed nearly all aspirations with an average of 3
separate passes into the lesion; no aspirations were

performed using radiologic guidance. This was often
done after a review of images with the orthopedic
surgeon, and occasionally coordinated placement of
the needle site. Conventional smears were made.
Slides were stained with a Romanowsky stain for the
initial assessment. A preliminary interpretation was
issued within 20 minutes after the FNA. Remaining
slides were later stained using a modified Papanicolaou stain. Cell blocks were attempted by embedding
cells that were rinsed from each pass into a balanced
salt solution, and then using a thrombin clot method
to create a cell clot/block. This was then fixed in
10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.
Cell block slides were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin.

FISH Testing
FISH testing used a commercially available LSI
EWSR1 dual-color, break-apart probe set (Vysis Inc,
Downers Grove, Ill). This probe searched for translocations involving the EWSR1 gene on chromosome
22q12. An abnormal cell with a translocation reveals
1 pair of separate or ‘‘split’’ signals rather than 2
fused signals as occurs in a normal cell. Split signals
in [20% of the cells were considered to be a positive
result. FISH testing was performed on cell blocks in
only 2 cases, and on both the cell block and cytospin
smear in 2 cases.

RESULTS
A total of 107 FNA specimens from 98 patients with
HGS were performed. Ten aspirates were found to be
nondiagnostic (no malignant cells, necrosis only, or
too few cells to issue a diagnosis) (Table 1). Of the 97
cases (91%) deemed satisfactory for interpretation, 6
were diagnosed as something other than HGS (1 malignant lymphoma, 1 hematoma, 1 spindle cell
lesion, 1 suspicious, 1 low-grade sarcoma, and 1 sarcoma, not otherwise specified), resulting in a sensitivity of 94%. The remaining 91 HGS aspiration
specimens contained 3 false-positive diagnoses (2
low-grade sarcomas and 1 hematoma). The positive
predictive value and accuracy of an FNA diagnosis of
HGS were 88 of 91 cases (97%) and 88 of 97 cases
(91%), respectively.
Of the 10 nondiagnostic cases and 6 cases diagnosed as being other than HGS, 9 had a core needle
biopsy (CNB) finding that confirmed the diagnosis of
HGS, 5 had open biopsy (2 of these had a CNB that
was nondiagnostic), and 1 patient diagnosed as having recurrent myxoid liposarcoma (LPS) underwent
an electively scheduled amputation. Resection of that

tumor demonstrated myxoid LPS with a focus of
round cell LPS.
Three false-positive cases (Cases 6, 33, and 36),
and 1 case diagnosed as malignant lymphoma (Case
96) did not appear to adversely impact patient outcome. In 2 cases, resection revised the diagnosis of
HGS to low-grade spindle cell sarcoma after tissue
examination. Neither patient received chemotherapy;
each underwent a surgical procedure similar to what
would have been performed had a diagnosis of HGS
been made. The patient with a hematoma (Case 6)
that was misdiagnosed as HGS had a computed tomography (CT) scan finding that was worrisome for
sarcoma. The mass decreased in size 1 week after
FNA. Incisional biopsy revealed organizing hematoma and exuberant granulation tissue. The patient
with a Ewing sarcoma (EWS) that was misdiagnosed
as lymphoma underwent open biopsy 6 days later
when the flow cytometric findings from the FNA
were negative; no interval therapy was instituted. We
encountered no cases of metastatic carcinoma that
were mistaken for HGS.
Patients ranged in age from 13 to 90 years (mean
age, 56 years) with 50 men and 48 women (male:
female ratio of 1:1). Six patients underwent 2 FNA
biopsies (Cases 16 and 17, 5 and 32, 50 and 56, 30 and
53, 20 and 48, and 37 and 54) because of a local mass
or metastasis. One patient underwent 4 FNA biopsies
(Cases 47, 77, 78, and 79).
Of the 91 HGS aspiration specimens, 54 (59%)
were diagnosed as HGS corresponding to a pleomorphic sarcoma of no specific type, 8 (9%) as highgrade myxofibrosarcoma, 8 (9%) as osteosarcoma, 5
(5%) as high-grade malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor (MPNST), 5 (5%) as high-grade leiomyosarcoma, 4 (4%) as EWS, 4 (4%) as high-grade
LPS, 2 (2%) as epithelioid sarcoma, and 1 (1%) as
high-grade angiosarcoma. Seventy-six aspiration specimens (71%) were of a primary soft tissue mass, 24
(22%) were of a locally recurrent mass, and 7 (7%)
were presumed metastases. Of the aspiration specimens of a new (primary) soft tissue mass, 58 of 76
(76%) were correctly diagnosed as HGS; 3 were falsepositive findings, 10 were nondiagnostic, and 5 were
diagnosed as an entity other than HGS. When the 10
nondiagnostic aspiration specimens were discounted,
the sensitivity was 92% and the positive predictive
value was 95% for recognizing primary HGS by FNA.
Only 15% of cell blocks contained sufficient cellular
material to aid in the final interpretation.
Sites included the lower extremity in 63 cases
(59%), the upper extremity in 20 cases (19%), the
trunk in 16 cases (15%), the groin in 4 cases (4%),
and the head/neck region in 4 cases (4%). Of 91 HGS

495

diagnoses, 80 (88%) were confirmed histologically, 6
(7%) were confirmed clinically, 1 was confirmed
cytogenetically (1%; Case 15), and 3 (3%) were falsepositive findings. One patient was lost to follow-up.
Tissue specimens after FNA included 56 wide excision/radical resections, 17 amputations, 12 CNBs, 8
open biopsies, 3 excisional biopsies, and 1 punch biopsy. Six clinically confirmed cases included 4
patients who declined further treatment and were
sent to hospice for palliative care due to deteriorating clinical status, 1 patient with radiographically demonstrable metastases to several sites, and 1 patient
who died with clinical disease but did not undergo
an autopsy.
Four of 5 patients diagnosed with MPNST (1
patient with 2 separate FNA biopsies) had a known
history and clinical stigmata of NF-1. Sixteen patients
had a known bone lesion with soft tissue extension
at the time of FNA. No complications was known to
occur in any patient as a consequence of FNA
biopsy.

Patients Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Nineteen patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Three underwent a subsequent CNB or open
surgical biopsy shortly after the FNA diagnosis (Cases
55, 59, and 68) to confirm the cytologic diagnosis.
Sixteen patients (6 with HGS, 6 with osteosarcoma,
and 4 with EWS) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
based on the FNA diagnosis alone. All 16 patients
had subsequent tissue specimens that verified the
FNA diagnosis. Four patients with EWS who were
treated based on the cytologic diagnosis had positive
FISH results for the EWRS-1 translocation. Three
patients were diagnosed with osseous EWS with soft
tissue involvement, and 1 patient was diagnosed
with an extraosseous EWS. Three of 4 patients underwent definitive surgical resection after completing
chemotherapy, all of whom demonstrated [90% tumor necrosis. One patient with EWS (Case 15) had
such a remarkable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy that surgery was not pursued, thereby preserving his shoulder function. All 8 soft tissue masses
diagnosed as osteosarcoma originated from an
underlying bone lesion. Six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before definitive surgical resection based on the FNA diagnosis only. Another
patient with osteosarcoma was diagnosed as having
HGS, not otherwise specified, by FNA. Subsequent
surgical resection demonstrated a sufficient amount
of viable tumor to confirm the FNA diagnosis with
varying amounts of necrosis noted in each of these
cases. One patient with HGS (Case 7) achieved a
complete response such that no viable sarcoma

496

CANCER (CANCER CYTOPATHOLOGY) December 25, 2007 / Volume 111 / Number 6

remained in the resection; 19 months later, it
was found that HGS had metastasized to the small
intestine.

DISCUSSION
Accurate pathologic diagnosis is crucial to the management of patients with soft tissue sarcomas
because many will require drastic, debilitating surgery. The most appropriate type of biopsy to establish a pathologic diagnosis has been the subject of
many reports. The ‘‘gold standard’’ is incisional/open
biopsy because it overcomes (in most instances) the
problems of sampling error, histologic heterogeneity,
and necrosis within a sarcoma. It often allows
for reliable mitotic counts and estimation of the
percentage of necrosis, thus permitting accurate
grading.3,4 Nonetheless, because of the wound complications and tumor spillage associated with open
biopsy, CNB is currently in vogue and appears to be
a more common procedure in many busy orthopedic
centers because of substantial savings in time and
cost, and minimal morbidity compared with incisional biopsy.5–7 Although some studies quote a
lower rate of accuracy when compared with open biopsy, CNB is still considered an acceptable substitute
for patients with large soft tissue masses or bone
tumors with soft tissue extension.8
Pathologists and even experienced cytopathologists usually approach the FNA interpretation of a
possible soft tissue sarcoma with trepidation. Current
sentiment is that FNA biopsy can be used to confirm/rule out local disease recurrence or metastasis
in a known sarcoma patient, but not for an initial
sarcoma diagnosis or to perform a major resection
based on FNA diagnosis.9 We agree with others that
due to their infrequency, their histologic heterogeneity, their overlapping histomorphologic features with
some reactive lesions, the difficulty sometimes associated with the procurement of an ample amount of
diagnostic material, and the inherent difficulty associated with the pathologic interpretation of a sarcoma even in tissue specimens, FNA biopsy of these
neoplasms should be attempted only in centers
associated with a sufficient volume and experience
with both performing and interpreting FNA biopsy
results.1 Because pathologists in Sweden are reported
to have the largest experience with soft tissue aspiration, they have espoused this form of tissue sampling
more than others,10 and some have now advocated
supplementing FNA with CNB because both techniques appear to complement one another.11 Others
also have found the combination of CNB and FNA to
be more clinically useful as opposed to FNA alone.12

Ancillary studies should be an important component
of soft tissue FNA biopsy whenever possible. Cell
blocks made from FNA can act as surrogates for CNB
because they allow one to apply immunohistology
and FISH to aspiration samples. Unfortunately, during this time period, the quality of our cell block material was poor due primarily to technical factors in
the laboratory. We were only able to capture sufficient cells in 15% of our aspiration specimens for
immunostaining. FISH testing for chromosomal
translocations in select sarcomas is another avenue
for confirmatory testing and can be applied to FNA
specimens. In all 4 examples of EWS, we were able
to apply the EWS gene translocation to support our
combined cytologic, radiologic, and clinical impressions. Other sarcomas that are potential targets of
FISH testing from FNA specimens include low-grade
fibromyxoid sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma,
clear cell sarcoma of soft parts, extraskeletal myxoid
chondrosarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and synovial
sarcoma. We either did not possess the probe for
these other tumors at the time the case was encountered or did not encounter examples of these tumors
in the current study.
To our knowledge, the current study is one of
the largest series of FNA biopsy diagnoses of HGS
reported to date. The majority of cases represented
high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with no specific
differentiation, or what until recently had been
termed ‘‘malignant fibrous histiocytoma.’’ An unexplainable fact of this series is that only 1 example of
synovial sarcoma was aspirated during this time period, and that aspiration sample was found to be
nondiagnostic. After eliminating 10 nondiagnostic
samples, we found 91% were adequate for diagnosis;
91 aspiration specimens were diagnosed as some
form/subtype of HGS. Six tissue-documented HGS
were misdiagnosed by a prior FNA. Three of 91 HGS
aspiration specimens represented false-positive diagnoses. During this 6-year interval, we were able to
achieve a sensitivity of 94% (excluding the 10 nondiagnostic cases), a positive predictive value of 97%,
and an overall accuracy of 91% in our ability to diagnose HGS using FNA biopsy. Nearly 75% of our
aspiration specimens were from primary, previously
undiagnosed, malignancies. Nearly 90% of our cytologic diagnoses were followed eventually by some
form of tissue confirmation and 7% by a subsequent
clinical course. This degree of accuracy was accomplished only through a close collaboration of pathologists willing to see the patient (thus creating a
clinical impression with review of images when available, and the ability to issue immediate diagnostic
feedback), and knowledgeable orthopedic surgeons

skilled in radiographic interpretation. As in all musculoskeletal oncology, the clinical and radiologic
appearance must correlate with the FNA impression;
if it does not, our surgeons will proceed with CNB or
open biopsy depending on the nature of the lesion.
This is analogous to applying a ‘‘triple test’’ as is
done in breast cytopathology so that our 3 false-positive cases did not result in any harm or improper
treatment to the patient.
What advantage, if any, has this form of biopsy
over more conventional methods? For us, this technique allows the patient to be given a preliminary diagnosis on the day of the initial consultation. Staging
studies and medical workup can be expedited and
initiated that same day. FNA biopsy tracts cause less
contamination because there is not as large an
amount of tissue that is passed through the needle
tract as in CNB. Therefore, our surgeons have chosen
not to remove the biopsy tract with definitive surgical
resection. This does not appear to compromise clinical outcome. Therefore, morbidity of resection may be
decreased by not resecting the skin with an FNA biopsy, and in some cases it might prevent a split thickness skin graft from having to be performed. There is
minimal disruption of the tumor bed leading to a
reduced risk of hematoma formation because a smaller needle is used, thereby causing less trauma and
risk of injury to a feeder blood vessel. Another reason
is practice enhancement for the clinician. A much
more rapid turnaround of patients occurs with FNA
biopsy, allowing surgeons and oncologists to see more
individuals in a single clinical setting. FNA is a lower
cost alternative to conventional open biopsy or CNB
while still facilitating patient workup and generating
sufficient relevant diagnostic information to guide
therapeutic management. This latter point was
emphasized by Kilpatrick et al, who demonstrated that
FNA biopsy was sufficient to begin definitive therapy
in 83% of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.13
Grading of soft tissue sarcomas is important in
predicting biologic behavior, and involves both tumor subclassification and certain histomorphologic
parameters. Although the National Cancer Institute
and French grading system are currently the 2 most
commonly used grading systems, no grading system
fits every type of sarcoma,14 and some centers have
employed nomograms to help determine sarcoma
survival.15 Furthermore, the histomorphologic criteria
used for grading in these 2 schema are not applicable to any form of needle biopsy be it FNA or CNB.
Nevertheless, CNB has been shown to accurately
grade approximately 85% of sarcomas when it is
used by experienced soft tissue pathologists.6 Our
practice has been to attempt to determine cytologic

497

grade from sarcoma aspiration specimens whenever
possible. This has been used to influence the extent
of surgical resection, and decide whether neoadjuvant therapy may be administered to eligible
patients. In 16 patients, the clinical and radiographic
features were compelling enough that FNA biopsy
was the sole pathologic discriminator used to administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and in 3 of these
patients it was followed by CNB or open biopsy
before chemotherapy. The FNA diagnosis was validated in all 16 patients who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy by eventual tissue examination. Previous reports of FNA grading of sarcoma have reported
variable success. In a retrospective review of 77 cases
using a 3-grade system, 3 different pathologists were
able to accurately predict the final histologic grade
from FNA biopsy alone in only 43% to 50% of
cases,16 whereas Palmer et al were able to achieve
90% concordance in 59 cases of histologically confirmed sarcomas when using a 2-grade system17 and
Weir et al reported a 92% grading accuracy rate in 36
cases of spindle cell sarcoma.18
The shortcomings of the current study are that
we only included FNA specimens of palpable masses
and not those of deep lesions that could have been
aspirated using radiologic guidance. Although we
used a 1.5-inch and occasionally a 2-inch needle,
some of our nondiagnostic aspiration specimens
were the result of the lesion being deeper than we
could reach with these needles. In addition, we did
not attempt during this period to review all soft tissue FNA biopsies diagnosed as sarcoma to determine
the overall accuracy of the technique; we focused
only on those aspiration samples designated as HGS.
Moreover, we included 16 cases that could rightly be
interpreted not as soft tissue tumors but as bone sarcomas presenting with soft tissue masses (8 osteosarcomas detected by FNA, 4 osteosarcomas diagnosed
as HGS by FNA, and 4 osseous EWS [1 of which was
misdiagnosed as lymphoma]). Because the diagnosis
of a malignant bone tumor is often reasonably certain from its radiographic appearance alone, one
could argue that FNA biopsy is merely a confirmatory test in this situation. As noted, our clinicians
were more comfortable administering neoadjuvant
chemotherapy without histopathologic confirmation
for a bone sarcoma because 10 of 16 patients had either osteosarcoma or EWS diagnoses made by FNA
before neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
In the current study, we reported a high success
rate in the recognition of HGS using FNA biopsy.
Although we have embraced the value of this technique, it should not be overstated. Cytologists without
familiarity or the resources to make an accurate diag-

nosis may wish to avoid FNA in this circumstance or,
alternatively, have the patient referred to the appropriate
institution. Our experience leads us to believe that
patients treated at specialty orthopedic centers with a
high volume of these neoplasms can benefit from the
incorporation of FNA by orthopedists into their practice.
