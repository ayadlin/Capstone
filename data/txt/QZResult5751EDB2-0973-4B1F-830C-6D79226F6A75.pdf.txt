ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSC) may take advantage of the Warburg effect-induced
siphoning of metabolic intermediates into de novo fatty acid biosynthesis to increase
self-renewal growth. We examined the anti-CSC effects of the antifungal polyketide
soraphen A, a specific inhibitor of the first committed step of lipid biosynthesis
catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA). The mammosphere formation capability
of MCF-7 cells was reduced following treatment with soraphen A in a dose-dependent
manner. MCF-7 cells engineered to overexpress the oncogene HER2 (MCF-7/HER2
cells) were 5-fold more sensitive than MCF-7 parental cells to soraphen A-induced
reductions in mammosphere-forming efficiency. Soraphen A treatment notably
decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSC-like cells and impeded
the HER2’s ability to increase the ALDH+-stem cell population. The following results
confirmed that soraphen A-induced suppression of CSC populations occurred through
ACACA-driven lipogenesis: a.) exogenous supplementation with supraphysiological
concentrations of oleic acid fully rescued mammosphere formation in the presence
of soraphen A and b.) mammosphere cultures of MCF-7 cells with stably silenced
expression of the cytosolic isoform ACACA1, which specifically participates in de novo
lipogenesis, were mostly refractory to soraphen A treatment. Our findings reveal for
the first time that ACACA may constitute a previously unrecognized target for novel
anti-breast CSC therapies.

INTRODUCTION

Several attempts have been made to therapeutically
modulate the metabolic state of cancer cells by treating
with compounds that inhibit the most recognizable
bioenergetic feature of tumor cells, i.e., aerobic glycolysis
(the Warburg effect) [7-11]. However, efforts to inhibit
glycolysis using the glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), which accumulates in cells and inhibits glycolytic
hexokinase (KH), or the small molecule dichloroacetate
(DCA), which inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and forces pyruvate into
the mitochondria to increase mitochondrial metabolism,
remain unsatisfactory. In addition, these approaches

Accumulating evidence indicates that the metabolic
state of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a population of cancer
cells capable of enhanced self-renewal, governs their
tumor-initiating ability. Additionally, CSCs are resistant
to conventional therapy and are significantly different
from their differentiated cellular counterparts. Because
metabolic reprogramming may control the ability of CSCs
to avoid treatment and promote recurrence, successful
metabolic therapy may eliminate these key drivers of
tumor formation, progression, and recurrence [1-6].

are not selective for either CSCs or more differentiated
bulk tumor cells, and drugs that inhibit glycolysis do not
necessarily result in increased mitochondrial metabolism
and could result in the disruption of energy production
and non-selective cell death. Thus, glycolysis inhibitors
may be undesirably toxic to non-cancerous tissues that
depend on glycolysis for energy production (i.e., skeletal
muscle or brain tissues). CSCs are known to contain
lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels than their
cancerous epithelial-like progeny cells [12]. Therefore,
one therapeutic alternative to consider is the re-activation
of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, which in turn
would impact the suppression of ROS-induced killing in
CSCs, as opposed to acutely inducing energy starvation
and cell death in all tissues utilizing glycolysis for energy
production. In particular, the mitochondrial regulator
metformin has been increasingly recognized as a strong
therapeutic capable of targeting CSCs in pre-clinical
models of human cancer [13-23].
Another possible treatment approach is related to
the commonly observed upregulation of endogenous lipid
biosynthetic pathways in cancer tissues. This so-called
lipogenic phenotype fuels membrane biogenesis in rapidly
proliferating cancer cells and renders cancer membrane
lipids more saturated. The lipogenic phenotype also
impacts fundamental cellular processes associated with
cancer cell transformation, including signal transduction,
gene expression, ciliogenesis, and response to therapy
[24-30]. In the fatty acid synthesis pathway, acetyl-CoA is
carboxylated to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACACA). Both acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are then
used in a condensation reaction by the main lipogenic
enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) to produce long-chain
fatty acids. Of note, it is known that higher expression
levels of lipogenic genes and proteins such as FASN are
found in CSC subpopulations of breast cancer cell lines
and that upregulation of de novo fatty acid biogenesis is
a pre-requisite for the formation of pre-malignant lesions
due to increased CSC survival [31-35]. Moreover, recent
studies performed in induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) have revealed that when activities of the ACACA
and FASN lipogenic enzymes are inhibited, the efficiency
of somatic reprogramming to stemness is decreased [30].
Coincidentally, ACACA and FASN are highly expressed
in iPSCs. We recently hypothesized that the stemness
features of cancer cells may take advantage of the
Warburg effect-related ability of tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle intermediates to be siphoned into lipid biosynthesis
metabolism for CSC self-renewal and survival.
To test the hypothesis that the therapeutic targeting
of endogenous lipogenesis may impact the CSC cellular
state in heterogeneous breast cancer cell populations, we
examined the polyketide soraphen A, which was chosen for
these studies because its mechanism of ACACA inhibition
is well defined [36-43]. Unlike RNA interference-based
approaches [44], the rapidity of soraphen A-induced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition of lipid metabolism minimizes non-specific
or adaptive changes caused by changes in cell fatty acid
composition and cell growth. Our current results are the
first to show that soraphen A treatment can inhibit the
formation of mammospheres in a fatty acid-dependent
manner, highlighting the potential value of ACACA as a
novel metabolic target in breast CSC.

RESULTS
Soraphen A decreases mammosphere formation in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells
We first tested the ability of MCF-7 breast cancer
cells to form tumor spheres when grown in suspension
cultures in the presence of a range of concentrations
of soraphen A (1, 5, 10, and 50 nmol/L). The MSFE
was calculated as the number of sphere-like structures
(diameter >50 µm) divided by the original number of cells
seeded and expressed as the mean percentage (±SD). A
subset (2.0 ± 0.01%) of untreated MCF-7 breast cancer
cells formed bona fide mammospheres upon initial plating,
and this result confirms previous reports that MCF-7
cell cultures intrinsically contain a SC-like population.
Interestingly, the spheroid formation capability of MCF7 cells was significantly reduced following treatment
with increasing concentrations of soraphen A in a dosedependent manner (50% reduction at 15 nmol/L soraphen
A; Fig. 1, left and middle panels). Although the ability of
some CSC-like cellular states to survive and proliferate as
floating spherical colonies under anchorage-independent
conditions at low frequencies (1-3%) is commonly
regarded as an in vitro surrogate of the self-renewal
and tumor-initiating capacity exclusively possessed by
CSCs, it should be acknowledged that mammosphere
formation assays can also be viewed as bona fide assays
for evaluating the number of anoikis-resistant cells within
heterogenous cancer populations. To unambiguously
validate the anti-CSC effects of soraphen A, anoikis was
induced by plating MCF-7 cells into culture dishes that
had been coated with poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
(Poly-HEME) in the absence or presence of soraphen A
(50 nmol/L; 48 h) prior to replating a viable fraction of
the suspended samples in serum- and soraphen A-free
mammosphere medium. Remarkably, soraphen A-treated
anoikis cultures reduced by 50% their mammosphereformation efficiency after removal of the drug (Fig. 1, right
panel). Importantly, the soraphen A-induced reduction
in mammosphere formation was not due to non-specific
toxicity, as MTT-based experiments in monolayer cultures
of MCF-7 cells showed that cell viability remained as
high as 90% in the presence of identical nanomolar
concentrations of soraphen A (Fig. 1, middle panels).

a natural model of HER2 overexpression and HER2
dependency for cell proliferation and survival (data not
shown).
Similar to the results obtained with MCF-7 cells,
the reductions in mammosphere formation were not
due to non-specific soraphen A toxicity, as identical
concentrations of the drug had no drastic impact on MCF7/HER2 cell viability under adherent culture conditions.
These findings strongly suggest that the mechanism of
action targeted by nanomolar concentrations of soraphen A
is not essential for the bulk breast cancer cell population.

We next examined whether treatment with soraphen
A was sufficient to prevent the well-recognized ability of
the oncogene HER2 to expand the breast CSC population.
MCF-7 cells engineered to overexpress HER2 (MCF7/HER2) exhibited a significantly increased ability to
form mammospheres (3.8 ± 0.1%) compared to parental
MCF-7 cells. However, this enhanced spheroid formation
capability of MCF-7/HER2 cells was drastically reduced
following treatment with soraphen A, which decreased
the MSFE by 50% at ∼3 nmol/L (i.e., a Soraphen A
concentration 5 times lower than that needed to decrease
MSFE by 50% in MCF-7 parental cells). The highest
dose of the soraphen A (50 nmol/L) elicited inhibitory
effects of ∼80% compared to the basal MSFE found in
untreated MCF-7/HER2 tumor sphere cultures (Fig. 2).
Mammosphere formation was also drastically decreased
by soraphen A treatment in SKBR3 cells, which are

a density of ∼105 cells/mL (total of 2 x 105 cells/well) in the absence or presence of 50 nmol/L soraphen A and then incubated at 37 oC
for an additional 48 h. Cells that were visibly anoikis-resistant with intact plasma membranes, i.e., excluding trypan blue stain, were then
cultured in soraphen A-free mammosphere medium for 7 days following the same procedure as described above. The results are presented

Soraphen A suppresses HER2-enhanced
mammosphere formation by blocking endogenous
lipogenesis

provided preliminary insight as to the Soraphen A’s
mechanism of action, in particular to its putative ability to
specifically remove CSCs from the bulk population. We
therefore envisioned that Soraphen A might specifically
suppress aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSClike cells. Using flow cytometry and the ALDEFLUOR®
reagent, we first confirmed the presence of an enhanced
aldefluor-positive sub-population in MCF-7 and MCF-7/
HER2 cells. In Soraphen A-naïve MCF-7 cell populations,
approximately 2.4% of the cells expressed high ALDH
activity (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in Soraphen A-treated
MCF-7 cell populations, solely 1.5% of the cells remained
ALDH-positive. We confirmed that overexpression of
HER2 increased the aldefluor-positive population almost
twofold compared to MCF-7 parental cells; remarkably,
the aldefluor-positive cell content drastically decreased
from 4% in Soraphen A-naïve MCF-7/HER2 cell
populations to 1.8% in Soraphen A-treated MCF-7/HER2
cells (Fig. 3B).

We next sought to unambiguously establish that
soraphen A suppresses mammosphere formation by
inhibiting de novo fatty acid biogenesis (Fig. 4A, left
panel). Therefore, we determined the rescue potential of
oleic acid when the lipogenic pathway was specifically
blocked through treatment with soraphen A. The strong
inhibitory effects of soraphen A on the mammosphere
formation capability of MCF-7/HER2 cells were fully
counteracted by supplementation of the mammosphere
medium with micromolar concentrations of oleic acid (100
µmol/L; Fig. 4A, middle panel).
Notably, in the presence of a gradient of noncytotoxic micromolar concentrations of the FASN
inhibitor C75, MCF-7 cells lost their ability to develop
mammospheres in a dose-dependent manner with the
highest dose of C75 (10 µmol/L) eliciting consistently
greater inhibitory effects than the lowest dose (0.1
µmol/L). Indeed, 10 µmol/L C75 dramatically suppressed

mammosphere formation between conditions of ACACA
chemical inhibition versus ACACA gene silencing. A
previous study reported that knockdown of ACACA
recapitulated AMPK activation and facilitated anchorageindependent growth [45]. Our data indicated that ACACA
silencing elicited stronger mammosphere formation in
MCF-7shACACA1 cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, we observed
that the enhanced mammosphere formation ability of
MCF-7shACACA1 cell was mostly refractory to soraphen A
treatment even at concentrations of 100 nmol/L, which
were able to fully suppress the mammosphere formation
capability of MCF-7 parental cells.

Soraphen A suppresses mammosphere formation
via ACACA
We next evaluated whether soraphen A-induced
inhibition of mammosphere formation occurred through
the specific targeting of ACACA. To do so, we reevaluated
the effects of soraphen A on the mammosphere capability
of MCF-7 cells in which the ACACA gene was stably
silenced via lentiviral-delivered small hairpin RNA
(MCF-7shACACA1). First, we confirmed differences in

DISCUSSION

formation as stable genetic silencing of the cytosolic
isoform ACACA1, which specifically participates in de
novo lipogenesis. As reported in the study by Jeon et al.
[45], knockdown of ACACA was found to recapitulate
AMPK activation and facilitate anchorage-independent
growth. Thus, MCF-7 cells with stably silenced expression
of the cytosolic isoform ACACA1 demonstrate enhanced
mammosphere formation capacity. Interestingly, MCF7shACACA1 cells were largely refractory to concentrations
of soraphen A that completely suppressed mammosphere
formation in MCF-7 parental cells. This finding, as well
as the data showing that exogenous supplementation with
supraphysiological concentrations of the monounsaturated
fatty acid oleic acid fully rescued the ability of MCF-7/
HER2 cells to form mammospheres in the presence
of soraphen A, mechanistically confirm that soraphen
A-induced suppression of breast CSC populations
specifically occurs via blockade of ACACA1-driven
lipogenesis.
Soraphen A-induced inhibition of ACACA has been
shown to augment the accumulation of unsaturated fatty
acids derived from saturated and polyunsaturated fatty
acid precursors by impacting both fatty acid elongation
and by disrupting pathways where both elongases and
desaturases are utilized. The inhibition of ACACA
leads to a significant shift in fatty acid metabolism,
whereby saturated fatty acids and essential fatty acids are
desaturated but not elongated [42]. Thus, it is tempting to
speculate that unlike RNA interference-based approaches
[45], the rapid ability of soraphen A to acutely disrupt
a strong functional link between ACACA activity and
the synthesis of saturated-, monounsaturated-, and
polyunsaturated fatty acids through the control of fatty
acid elongase activity might underlie soraphen A-mediated
elimination of breast CSCs. Other studies have found
that reversing the lipogenic switch in cancer cells with
soraphen A treatment leads to a marked decrease in
saturated and mono-unsaturated phospholipid species
and an increase in the relative degree of polyunsaturation.
Because polyunsaturated acyl chains are more susceptible
to peroxidation, soraphen A-induced acute inhibition of
lipogenesis may increase the levels of peroxidation end
products and render cells more susceptible to oxidative
stress-induced cell death. One of the properties of
anoikis-resistant stem/progenitor cells is their ability
to survive in anchorage-independent conditions and
generate mammospheres. Thus, the soraphen A-induced
acute blockade of endogenous lipogenesis may impair
the intrinsic ability of CSCs to escape anoikis due to
increased oxidative damage and starvation and cell death
in detached microenvironmental conditions. In this regard,
exposure of breast cancer cells to soraphen A led to a
marked augmentation of cells ability to oxidize H2DCFDA (Fig. 4C); because H2DCF oxidation by ROS results in
formation of strongly fluorescent DCF which is considered
to be a marker of ROS abundance and low levels of ROS

Frustrated by the gene-centric limitations of
conventional approaches used to identify molecular
markers associated with rare tissue-specific subpopulations of CSCs, we recently postulated that CSCs
may display unique metabolic features that distinguish
them from the bulk of tumor cells. We hypothesized that
these metabolic properties may constitute a basis for
developing new therapeutic strategies to eliminate CSCs
[1]. One of the properties of stem/progenitor cells is their
ability to survive under anchorage-independent conditions
and generate mammospheres. Our current data are the first
to show a highly significant decrease in mammosphere
formation in the presence of the polyketide fungicide
soraphen A. These results confirm that the lipogenic
enzyme ACACA might represent a novel target for antibreast CSC therapies. These findings, together with the
ability of chemical inhibitors of FASN activity such as
C75 to recapitulate the anti-mammosphere activity of
the ACACA inhibitor soraphen A, also confirm that de
novo fatty acid biogenesis, a pathway that is frequently
deregulated during breast carcinogenesis, plays a
functional role in CSC self-renewal and survival.
Therapeutic exploitation of the lipogenic pathway
in cancer should consider the effects of blocking one
metabolic enzyme on the expression and activity of other
metabolic genes. In particular, it is essential to consider
that alternate mechanisms/pathways might compensate
for the inhibition of any enzyme in the lipogenic
pathway. For example, silencing of ATP citrate lyase
(ACLY), a cytosolic enzyme that converts citrate into a
shared precursor for fatty acid and mevalonate synthesis
such as acetyl-CoA, is sufficient to counteract stem cell
characteristics induced in diverse cancer cell systems.
Moreover, the expression of FASN, which catalyzes
the rate-limiting reaction for fatty acid synthesis, and
HMGCR, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the
mevalonate pathway, were both shown to be significantly
enhanced after ACLY knockdown. These results suggest
that ACLY deficiency forces cancer cells to upregulate
the expression of downstream genes in fatty acid and
cholesterol synthesis pathways to compensate for the loss
of ACLY. Of note, this type of compensation that occurs
during the therapeutic targeting of lipogenesis-related
enzymes such as ACLY might be unacceptable for cancer
treatment [43, 46]. We acknowledge that our study failed
to evaluate whether the chemical perturbation of ACACA
promoted major changes in the expression profile of
other metabolic genes. However, the rapidity of soraphen
A-induced inhibition of de novo fatty acid biogenesis
appeared to minimize the occurrence of non-specific or
adaptive changes that could be switched on in response
to changes in cell fatty acid composition and cell growth.
In fact, the chemical inhibition of ACACA mediated by
soraphen A promoted the opposite effect on mammosphere

maintain characteristics of ROS, it might be tempting
to suggest that increasing ROS might be part of the
pharmacological mechanism through which soraphen A
promotes the loss of breast CSCs. Additionally, soraphen
A may alter the formation and functioning of membrane
microdomains such as lipid rafts, a recently recognized
mechanism involved in the escape from anoikis-induced
cell death [47-52].
Chemoresistant cell subpopulations from breast cell
lines have been shown to possess high levels of ALDH
activity. By virtue of those high levels of ALDH activity,
FACS can track chemoresistant CSC-like subpopulations
as ALDH-positive cells. Indeed, in several types of tumors
including breast cancer, cancer cell subpopulations that
are enriched for cancer-initiating activity have been
readily identified by flow cytometry analysis using the
ALDEFLUOR® reagent to identify cells with high levels
of ALDH activity [53-56]. We confirmed earlier studies
showing that HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
contain readily detectable higher amounts of ALDHpositive cells [57]. What we believe is remarkable here
is that treatment with no cytotoxic concentrations of
Soraphen A notably reduced the number of ALDH-positive
cells to those levels commonly found in breast cancer
cell lines expressing the lowest level of ALDH activity.
Moreover, Soraphen A treatment was sufficient to impede
the HER2’s ability to increase the stem cell population.
Therefore, in the presence of Soraphen, the decrease in
ALDH activity may account, at least in part, for the loss of
stemness of breast CSCs. This is very interesting since the
ALDH-positive cells represent the chemosensitive fraction
of biologically aggressive breast tumors and it indicates
the potential of Soraphen A-like molecules for eliminating
ALDH-positive chemoresistant cell subpopulations.
In summary, our findings confirm the importance
of de novo fatty acid biogenesis in CSC self-renewal and
survival and reveal for the first time that ACACA might
constitute a previously unrecognized target for novel antibreast CSC therapies. A large number of nanomolar smallmolecule ACACA inhibitors have been developed, and
several have been evaluated in clinical trials for metabolic
diseases such as obesity and metabolic syndrome [58-60].
The potency and mechanism of ACACA inhibition by
soraphen A strongly suggest that pharmacological targeting
of the soraphen A binding subunit dimerization site (i.e.,
the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain of the enzyme) may
be useful to identify potent, efficacious ACACA inhibitors
for cancer intervention. Using state-of-the art structurebased drug design and crystal structures of human ACACA
BC domain, Nimbus Discovery (Cambridge, MA) recently
identified a unique series of allosteric inhibitors with
low nanomolar potency (ND654, ND646) that bind to
the soraphen A binding site. These inhibitors show antineoplastic properties against human non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro and
in vivo [61, 62]. If further studies support the anti-CSC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activity of these drug-like allosteric inhibitors to bind the
BC domain of ACACA with high potency and selectivity,
our current findings may open new avenues for exploring
potential anti-lipogenesis treatments to successfully target
breast CSCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs and reagents
Soraphen A purified from the myxobacterium
Sorangium cellulosum was kindly provided by Drs.
Klaus Gerth and Rolf Jansen (Hemholtz Zentrum für
Infektionsforschung GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany).
Oleic acid was purchased from Sigma. C75 was purchased
from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Soraphen A
and C75 were dissolved in DMSO, and stored in the dark
as stock solutions at -20 oC until utilization.

Culture conditions
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
The cells were routinely grown in improved MEM
(IMEM;BioSource International; Invitrogen S.A.,
Barcelona, Spain) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 2 mmol/L L-Glutamine. The cells were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95%
air and 5% CO2. The construction of pBABE/HER2
retroviruses and retroviral infection of MCF-7 cells to
generate MCF-7/pBABE and MCF-7/HER2 cells have
been described elsewhere [44]. The cells were screened
periodically for Mycoplasma contamination.

Mammosphere culture.
Mammospheres were generated from single cells of
the MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2, and MCF-7shACACA1 cell lines
seeded at 103 cells/cm2 in six-well ultralow attachment
plates (Corning Inc.). The sphere medium consisted of
F-12/DMEM containing 5 mg/mL insulin, 0.5 mg/mL
hydrocortisone, 2% B27 (Invitrogen Ltd.), and 20 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor. The medium was made semisolid by the addition of 0.5% methylcellulose (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) to prevent cell aggregation.

Mammosphere-forming efficiency.
The mammosphere-forming efficiency (MSFE) was
calculated as the number of sphere-like structures (large
diameter >50 µm) formed in 7 days divided by the original
number of cells seeded and expressed as a percentage
(mean ± SD).

cells. BAAA passively diffuses into live cells and is
then converted by intracellular ALDH into a negatively
charged product (BODIPY-aminoacetate) that is retained
inside cells, labeling the cells with a bright fluorescent
signal. After a washing step, the brightly fluorescent
ALDH-expressing cells (ALDHbright) were detected in
the green fluorescence channel (FL1; 520–540 nm) on a
FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). A sample of
cells was further stained with a specific ALDH inhibitor,
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) (Sigma), to serve
as a negative control for each experiment. Because only
cells with an intact cellular membrane can retain the
ALDH1 reaction product, only viable ALDHbright cells
were identified. Cells incubated with BAAA and DEAB
were used to establish the background signal and define
the ALDHbright region. Incubation of cells with the substrate
in the absence of DEAB induced a shift in the BAAA
fluorescence and defined the ALDHbright population.

6-well tissue plates were coated with 200 µl (12 mg/

(poly-HEME; Sigma) by incubation overnight at 40 oC. To
perform the anoikis assay, MCF-7 cells were trypsinized
into a single cell suspension, and 2 mL was cultured in
poly-HEME-coated plates at a density of ∼105 cells/mL
(total of 2 x 105 cells/well) in the absence or presence of
50 nmol/L soraphen A in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Metabolic status assessment (MTT-based cell
viability assays)
Cell viability was determined using a standard
colorimetric
MTT
(3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,
5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) reduction assay.
Exponentially growing cells were harvested by
trypsinization, seeded at a concentration of ~2.5 x 103
cells/200 μL/well in 96-well plates, and allowed to attach
overnight. The medium was then removed, and fresh
medium containing various concentrations of soraphen
A was added to the cultures as specified. Control cells
without soraphen A were cultured in parallel using
the same conditions with comparable media changes.
Following treatment (5 days), the medium was removed
and replaced with fresh drug-free medium (100 μL/well),
and MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well at
a 1/10 volume. After incubation for 2–3 h at 37°C, the
supernatants were carefully aspirated, and 100 μL of
DMSO was added to each well. The plates were agitated
to dissolve the crystal product. The optical density (OD)
was measured at 570 nm in a multi-well plate reader.
The cell viability effects resulting from exposure to
soraphen A were analyzed as percentages of the control
cell absorbances, which were obtained from control wells
treated with appropriate concentrations of the soraphen A
vehicle and processed simultaneously. For each treatment,
cell viability was evaluated as a percentage using the
following equation: (OD570 of treated sample/OD570 of
untreated sample) x 100.

Lentiviral transduction
Pre-packaged lentiviral particles that either
encoded a non-targeting shRNA (negative shRNA, sc108080) or sequences specifically targeting the human
ACCα(ACACA1) gene (sc-40312-V) were purchased
from a commercial provider (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.). To infect MCF-7 cells with virus, the regular
medium was replaced with culture medium containing
5 µg/mL polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc124220). MCF-7 cells were then exposed to lentiviruses
for 48 h. The lentiviral shRNA particles also encode a
puromycin resistance gene for transduction selection.
After infection, the cells were washed and grown
in culture medium containing 10 μg/mL puromycin
dihydrochloride (Sigma, P9620) for an additional 72 h.
The MCF-7 cells were allowed to proliferate for at least 1
week before any experimental procedures. To monitor the
lentiviral transduction efficiency and transgene expression
during the experiment we incubated additional subsets of
MCF-7 cells with lentiviral particles encoding a green
fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter (sc-108084). The
transduction efficiency (>90%) was calculated as the ratio
of the number of GFP-positive cells to the total number of
cells from five random visual fields in three independent
culture experiments.

ALDEFLUOR® activity assay

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Detection.

The ALDEFLUOR® assay (Stem Cell Technologies)
quantifies ALDH activity by measuring the conversion
of the ALDH substrate BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde
to the fluorescent product BODIPY aminoacetate.
Briefly, cells were suspended in ALDEFLUOR assay
buffer containing the fluorescent ALDH substrate
BODIPY-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA) and incubated
for 45 min at 37 oC. The assay buffer also contained a
transport inhibitor to prevent efflux of BAAA from the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Untreated cells as well as cells treated with soraphen
A were incubated 60 min with 10 μmol/L 2’,7’-dihydrodichlorofluorescein-diacetate (H2DCF-DA) (Invitrogen/
Molecular Probes) at 37˚C. Cellular green fluorescence
was then measured by flow cytometry. Following
oxidation by ROS and peroxides within cells the nonfluorescent substrate H2DCF-DA is converted to the highly
8313

Oncotarget

fluorescent derivative DCF [63-65]. The cell-permeant
non-fluorescent H2DCF-DA upon cleavage of the acetate
moiety by intercellular esterases and oxidation by ROS is
converted to strongly fluorescent DCF and thus reports the
ROS abundance.
