ABSTRACT
Breast tumors comprise an infrequent tumor cell population, termed breast
tumor initiating cells (BTIC), which sustain tumor growth, seed metastases and resist
cytotoxic therapies. Hence therapies are needed to target BTIC to provide more durable
breast cancer remissions than are currently achieved. We previously reported that
serotonergic system antagonists abrogated the activity of mouse BTIC resident in the
mammary tumors of a HER2-overexpressing model of breast cancer. Here we report
that antagonists of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) biosynthesis and activity,
including US Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antidepressants,
targeted BTIC resident in numerous breast tumor cell lines regardless of their clinical or
molecular subtype. Notably, inhibitors of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), required for
5-HT biosynthesis in select non-neuronal cells, the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT)
and several 5-HT receptors compromised BTIC activity as assessed by functional sphereforming assays. Consistent with these findings, human breast tumor cells express TPH1,
5-HT and SERT independent of their molecular or clinical subtype. Exposure of breast
tumor cells ex vivo to sertraline (Zoloft), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI),
reduced BTIC frequency as determined by transplanting drug-treated tumor cells into
immune-compromised mice. Moreover, another SSRI (vilazodone; Viibryd) synergized
with chemotherapy to shrink breast tumor xenografts in immune-compromised mice
by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and inducing their apoptosis. Collectively our data
suggest that antidepressants in combination with cytotoxic anticancer therapies may
be an appropriate treatment regimen for testing in clinical trials.

base. Recent findings demonstrate that induction of an
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) can endow
non-tumorigenic breast tumor cells with BTIC activity
implying that tumor cells transition between nontumorigenic and tumorigenic states [3–5]. Hence, the
abundant non-tumorigenic cell population may provide a
reservoir of BTIC.
These observations have therapeutic implications
[6–8]. Conventional cytotoxic therapies principally
eradicate the abundant non-tumorigenic progeny of
BTIC. Consequently tumors regress after cytotoxic

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer was the first malignancy of epithelial
tumors reported to follow the cancer stem cell (CSC)
model [1], which proposes that genomic alterations in
tissue-specific cells results in clonal tumor cell populations
with stem cell-like properties, including the capacity
for self-renewal and differentiation [2]. Hence tumors
following the CSC model comprise a cellular hierarchy
of infrequent BTIC at their apex and an abundant nontumorigenic cell population arising from BTIC at their

tumor cells in vitro and in vivo

therapies, but often recur likely due to therapy-resistant
BTIC. Indeed the frequency of BTIC increases in tumors
after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy [9] or after exposure
of breast tumor cells to chemotherapy ex vivo [10, 11].
Consequently, to provide durable breast cancer remissions
anticancer therapies should eradicate BTIC and their nontumorigenic progeny.
Identifying molecular targets required to maintain
BTIC activity would provide a means to develop antiBTIC therapies. However, the latter has been difficult
to achieve due to the scarcity of BTIC in human breast
tumors [12] or breast tumor cell lines and the inability
to sufficiently purify BTIC for molecular analyses
[13]. We previously reported that tumors from multiple
transgenic mouse models of breast cancer comprise a
high BTIC frequency [14], which is maintained when the
cells are propagated in chemically-defined, serum-free
medium [15] as non-adherent spheres, which we termed
tumorspheres [16]. The capacity to propagate BTICenriched tumor cells in vitro enabled a high-throughput
phenotypic screen using a sensitive cell viability assay
with approximately 35,000 compounds [17]. We found
that neurotransmitter antagonists comprised a high
frequency of the small molecules of known mechanism of
action that affected the viability of sphere-derived mouse
tumor cells. Moreover, we confirmed that the serotonergic
antagonists we identified targeted mouse BTIC and the
sphere-forming subpopulation of mouse tumorspheres.
Herein we report that serotonergic pathway components
are expressed in human breast tumor cell lines independent
of the molecular subtypes they model, and that inhibitors
of such proteins targeted BTIC and synergized with
docetaxel (Taxotere) to shrink breast tumor xenografts.

Before testing the effect of serotonin antagonists
in functional assays we determined whether SERT was
expressed in breast tumor cell lines modeling the various
molecular subtypes of breast cancer (Supplementary Table
1) [18]. We performed Western analyses of breast tumor cell
line lysates with a polyclonal antibody obtained from rabbits
immunized with a peptide comprising amino acids 388-400
of SERT, whose specificity has been previously validated
[19]. Western analyses revealed that all the breast tumor
cell lines expressed two SERT species identified previously
at roughly the same level independent of the breast cancer
molecular subtype that they mimicked (Figure 2) [19, 20].
The slowest migrating form of SERT detected with the
polyclonal antibody represents the glycosylated form of
the protein, whereas the faster migrating species is the nonglycosylated form of the protein, which co-migrated with
SERT in mouse brain lysates and with the alpha (α)-tubulin
loading control [19].
The natural substrate for SERT is 5-HT, which is
synthesized from tryptophan. Tryptophan hydroxylase
(TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT biosynthesis,
converts tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP),
which in turn serves as a substrate for aromatic L-amino
acid decarboxylase yielding 5-HT. There are 2 isoforms
of TPH encoded by independent genes that are expressed
in different tissues. TPH1 is expressed in a subset of cells
of specific non-neuronal tissues such as enterochromaffin
cells of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas TPH2 is
expressed primarily in presynaptic neurons in midbrain
raphe nuclei.
To learn whether TPH1 and 5-HT were expressed
in breast tumor cell lines we used immunofluorescence
(IF) staining with antibodies that bind to each of these
molecules as well as to SERT. The majority of cells in the
cell lines expressed TPH1, 5-HT and SERT (Supplementary
Figure 1). TPH1, 5-HT and SERT were also expressed
in most of the tumor cells in HCC1954 tumor xenografts
and tumorspheres (Figure 3). We similarly detected SERT
expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in sections
of patient-derived breast tumor xenografts (PDX), which
mimicked the histopathology of the primary tumors from
which they were derived, and comprised each of the major
clinical subtypes of breast cancer (Figure 4). Interestingly,
the IHC analysis revealed variation in the intensity of SERT
expression among the tumor cells in individual xenografts.
Hence the machinery to synthesize and transport 5-HT is
expressed in breast tumor cells regardless of their molecular
or clinical subtype.

RESULTS
SLC6A4 expression and gene copy number
variation in breast tumors
In advance of assessing the activity of 5-HT
antagonists in human breast tumor cell lines we mined
transcriptomic and genomic datasets of breast tumors to
determine whether 5-HT signaling might be implicated in
breast cancer. We focused primarily on SERT (encoded
by SLC6A4) because its antagonists include SSRI, highly
selective and safe drugs that are widely used to treat
depression and other mood disorders.
We initially determined whether SLC6A4
transcripts are differentially expressed in breast tumors
compared to normal breast samples. We found that
breast tumors overexpressed SLC6A4 transcripts by an
average of 2.8 fold compared to normal breast samples
(Figure 1a). We also determined whether SLC6A4 copy
number varied among breast tumor samples and found
that the gene is amplified in a fraction of human breast
tumors (Figure 1b and 1c). These findings suggested a
link between SERT and breast tumorigenesis.

epithelial stem cells (MESC) and BTIC [3, 21–25]. MESC
[23] and BTIC co-fractionate with sphere-forming cells after
fluorescence-activated cell sorting [13, 26], and agents that
alter MESC/BTIC frequency similarly affect the frequency
of sphere-forming cells [14, 27, 28] suggesting that MESC/
BTIC possess sphere-forming activity.
We have shown that spheres arise from dispersed
tumorsphere-derived cells in direct proportion to the
number of cells plated into the medium, and that the
frequency of sphere-forming cells, which averages 5% of
the total tumor cell population in human breast tumor cell
line-derived tumorspheres, can be accurately quantified
over a range of cell densities [27]. Moreover plating single

tumorsphere-derived cells into the wells of 96-well plates
yields spheres at the same frequency as those forming
when the cells are plated at higher cell densities [17].
We assayed the activity of 7 concentrations of
compounds known to be selective for TPH1, SERT or each
of 9 of the 14 human 5-HT receptors in HCC1954 breast
tumor cells to establish their half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) in sphere-forming assays. Selective
antagonists targeting TPH1, SERT and each of 7 5-HT
receptors (5-HT1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 2C, 5A, and 6) inhibited sphere
formation with an IC50 of less than 10 μM (Table 1).
Because one of our goals is to provide pre-clinical data
to determine whether existing FDA-approved drugs might
be candidates for drug repurposing as anticancer agents we

also tested a panel of serotonergic antidepressants for their
capacity to affect sphere formation. All the antidepressants
that were tested reduced sphere formation in a concentrationdependent fashion (Table 2).
Our high-throughput screen, which identified
serotonergic system antagonists as candidate anti-BTIC
agents, was carried out in mammary tumor cells from an

HER2 overexpressing mouse model of breast cancer [17].
Moreover, the HCC1954 breast tumor cell line we initially
used for sphere-forming assays also overexpresses HER2
(Supplementary Table 1). Hence we sought to learn whether
5-HT antagonists affected the sphere-forming activity
of breast tumor cell lines modeling different molecular
subtypes of breast cancer by establishing their IC50 [18].

Figure 2: SERT is expressed in breast tumor cell lines representative of all the molecular subtypes of breast cancer.
Western blot performed with breast tumor cell line lysates (35 μg) and mouse brain tissue after electrophoresis in 5-15% gradient
polyacrylamide gels reveal that the rabbit polyclonal antibody identifies SERT species that migrate between molecular mass markers of
63 kDa and 75 kDa, and between 48 kDa and 63 kDa. The arrowheads identify the glycosylated and non-glycosylated SERT species. Nonglycosylated SERT co-migrated with α-tubulin, the loading control, which is shown in the bottom-most panel.

All the antagonists reduced the sphere-forming
activity of the breast tumor cell lines (Table 3). The IC50
values of individual antagonists varied between some cell
lines, but this difference was unrelated to their molecular
subtype. Where differences in IC50 for a particular antagonist
occurred between cell lines, these pair-wise comparisons
invariably included the BT474 cell line. For example, the
IC50 of 4F-4PP in the BT474 cell line (Luminal B) was
greater than that in the MDA-MB-453 (Luminal B) or in
the HCC1954 (Basal A) cell line by 14 fold and 4.5 fold
respectively. Similarly the IC50 of SB-242084 in the BT474
cell line was nearly 8-fold higher than that in the HCC1954
cell line. These findings are likely related to the fact that
BT474 tumor cells are chemoresistant due to the increased
expression of ABC transporters [29].

differentiation programs, largely irreversible biological
processes, which require a sustained period for execution
and which reduce BTIC frequency [27, 30]. To learn
whether SSRI acted by a reversible or irreversible
mechanism to inhibit sphere formation, the spheres that
arose 4 days after exposure of HCC1954 tumorspherederived cells to defined concentrations of either vilazodone
or sertraline were dissociated, the same number of viable
cells from each sample were seeded into SSRI-free
medium for 4 days, and the number of spheres that arose
in the secondary sphere-forming assays was determined
and compared to those arising after exposure of the tumor
cells to the vehicle.
The tumorsphere-derived cells exposed to the
vehicle formed spheres in the secondary sphere-forming
assay at the same frequency (~5%) as they did in the
primary sphere-forming assays (Figure 5a and 5b). By
contrast, exposure of the tumorsphere-derived cells to each
SSRI during the primary sphere-forming assays reduced
the frequency of sphere-forming cells in a concentrationdependent fashion in the secondary sphere-forming

Human HCC1954 cells were grown in the presence of serial dilutions of each selective antagonist. Over a four-day
incubation many of the antagonists reduced sphere formation in a dose-dependent fashion. IC50 values (listed in μM) were

assays. Hence both SSRI targeted the sphere-forming
subpopulation of tumorspheres by an irreversible process.
The data showing that SSRI targeted sphere-forming
cells raised the likelihood that they targeted BTIC. Tumor
initiating cells, including BTIC, are functionally defined
by their capacity to initiate tumors following transplant
into rodents. Consequently we incubated dispersed
HCC1954 tumorsphere-derived cells into medium with the
vehicle or with sertraline at either 2.5μM (~IC50) or 5.0μM
(~IC90). Following exposure of the cells to the vehicle or
to sertraline, the spheres that formed were dissociated and
an equal number of viable cells were transplanted into one
of the #2 fat pads of 10 6-8 week old female non-obese
diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID)
mice. We monitored tumor incidence during a 15-week
period.
Tumor xenografts were detected in 1 of the 10 mice
transplanted with vehicle-treated tumor cells 4 weeks
following their transplantation, but by 6 weeks all the mice
in this cohort had developed tumor xenografts (Figure 5c).
Four of the 10 mice transplanted with tumor cells exposed
to 2.5μM sertraline developed xenografts by 5 weeks posttransplant, but by 7 weeks all the mice had developed
tumor xenografts. By contrast, only 1 mouse developed a
xenograft 6 weeks after transplant of tumor cells exposed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to 5.0μM sertraline, and all of the 9 remaining mice
remained tumor free for up to 15 weeks, at which time the
experiment was concluded. Hence exposure of tumor cells
to sertraline reduced the incidence of tumor xenografts and
delayed their appearance dependent on the concentration
of sertraline to which they were exposed ex vivo. These
findings are consistent with our previous observation
[14] and those of others [31] that the incidence and time
to appearance of tumors arising after transplanting tumor
cells into mice is directly proportional to the frequency of
BTIC in the transplanted tumor cell population.

Vilazodone synergizes with docetaxel to shrink
breast tumor xenografts
Any clinical studies to assess the efficacy of
serotonergic drugs in breast cancer patients will likely be
carried out by treating them with both a 5-HT antagonist
and conventional breast cancer therapies. We also imagine
that achieving durable breast cancer remissions in patients
will require targeting both the BTIC tumor cell population
and the non-tumorigenic tumor cell population, a potential
source of BTIC. Hence we sought to determine whether
vilazodone and docetaxel might be combined to affect
tumor xenograft growth in mice.

Dispersed cells from each human breast tumor cell line were suspended in serum-free, chemically-defined medium and the
effect of serial dilutions of the various compounds assayed for their capacity to affect sphere-formation. The compounds
reduced sphere-formation in all cell lines in dose-dependent fashion. The IC50 (expressed in μM) of each compound in each
cell line was calculated using GraphPad Prism 6. The IC50 values of the compounds in each cell line were determined in
two biological experiments. The blank values illustrate examples of compounds that were not tested in select cell lines. The

We used vilazodone for these experiments because
unlike some other SSRI vilazodone does not inhibit
CYP2D6, which is required for the conversion of the
breast cancer pro-drug tamoxifen into its active metabolite
endoxifen, nor does it affect CYP3A4 activity, which
metabolizes many chemotherapeutics [32]. We used

HCC1954 tumor cells because they form xenografts
more rapidly than any of the other breast tumor cell lines
we tested (data not shown). In advance of performing
the study we established the maximum tolerated dose
of vilazodone in combination with docetaxel (5 mg/
kg, half that which is normally employed) using the

dosing regimen we planned to use in subsequent in vivo
experiments (Figure 6a). The female NOD/SCID mice
tolerated 60 mg/kg and lower amounts of vilazodone
during a 3-week course of combination therapy, but
animals administered higher doses became moribund or
died (data not shown). Hence we used the 60 mg/kg dose
for the preclinical study.
We orthotopically transplanted HCC1954 tumor
cells dissociated from tumorspheres into NOD/SCID
female mice to elicit xenograft growth. When the
xenografts of mice averaged a volume of ~300 mm3 we
treated the mice with the vehicle (5 mice), vilazodone (5
mice), docetaxel (5 mice) or a combination of vilazodone
and docetaxel (7 mice) using the dosing schedule in
Figure 6a. Treatment of mice with the drugs occurred over
3 weeks; the mice were sacrificed a week after the third
treatment cycle. Tumor volume was measured every 4
days after the treatment started.
The tumor xenografts of the vehicle-treated mice
increased in volume 6-7 fold during the time course of
the experiment (Figure 6b). The xenografts of mice
administered vilazodone or docetaxel also increased in

volume after treatment started, but to a lesser extent (2fold) than those of mice administered the vehicle. By
contrast, the volume of the xenografts of mice treated
with both vilazodone and docetaxel decreased after the
first treatment cycle and continued to decline after the
third treatment cycle (Figure 6c). Four of the xenografts
remaining after combination therapy were nodules and 2
others were blood filled (Supplementary Figure 2). Hence
the combination of both drugs reduced xenograft growth
to a much greater extent than did each drug individually
suggesting that the drugs functioned synergistically. These
findings recapitulate our previous observations where we
showed that the combination of docetaxel and sertraline
functioned synergistically both in vitro and in vivo using
mouse mammary tumor cells [33]. Our findings are
consistent with the hypothesis that each drug targets a
different tumor cell population; docetaxel likely eliminates
the non-tumorigenic tumor cells whereas vilazodone or
sertraline eradicates the BTIC, which serve as the source
of the non-tumorigenic tumor cells.
To uncover potential mechanisms by which
vilazodone and/or docetaxel limited xenograft growth, we

prepared sections from the tumor xenografts at the end of
the treatment period and stained them with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) to reveal their histology. The xenografts
of mice treated with vilazodone were morphologically
distinct from those of mice administered the vehicle
comprising clusters of tumor cells separated by cell-free
areas, which contained stromal cells and extra-cellular
debris (Figure 7). Xenografts from docetaxel-treated mice
appeared histologically similar to those of the vehicletreated mice. By contrast, the xenografts harvested from
mice that were treated with the drug combination were
largely devoid of tumor cells, and comprised red blood
cells as well as regions of stromal cells and cellular debris.

vilazodone, docetaxel or their combination we enquired
whether their effect on tumor growth could be ascribed
to changes in tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis. We
used immunohistochemistry (IHC) with antibodies to
Ki67 to estimate the frequency of proliferating cells in
tumor sections from all 4 treatment-groups at the end of
the treatment period. Neither vilazodone nor docetaxel
individually affected the frequency of Ki67-positive
tumor cells (Supplementary Figure 3). However, we
observed a substantial decrease in Ki67-positive cells in
xenograft sections from mice treated with the combination

of vilazodone and docetaxel compared to those of mice
administered the vehicle or each drug individually.
TUNEL assays with xenograft sections demonstrated
that vilazodone increased the frequency of apoptotic cells,
whereas docetaxel had little effect (Figure 7). Xenografts
of mice administered both drugs comprised fewer tumor
cells, which occurred in clusters, and any remaining tumor
cells in surrounding regions were undergoing apoptosis.
These observations suggest that the drug combination
shrank the xenografts by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation
and by inducing their apoptosis. Kinetic analyses of tumor
cell proliferation and apoptosis during the treatment period
would provide stronger support for the conclusion that
the reduced rate of tumor xenograft growth results from
changes in these cellular processes.

DISCUSSION
Our data demonstrate that breast tumor cells possess
the enzymatic machinery to synthesize 5-HT, which acts
by an autocrine or paracrine mechanism in conjunction
with other serotonergic pathway components to maintain
BTIC activity. Structurally unrelated selective antagonists
affecting the activity of TPH1, SERT and a minimum of 7
individual 5-HT receptors reduced the frequency of BTIC

Figure 7: The combination of vilazodone and docetaxel reduces the frequency of proliferating tumor cells and increases
that of apoptotic cells in tumor xenografts to a greater extent than do either compound individually. Xenografts resected
from mice that were administered the vehicle, vilazodone, docetaxel or a combination of each drug were fixed, embedded, sectioned and
stained with H&E, antibodies to Ki67 or assayed for fragmented DNA using the TUNEL assay. The various panels from each xenograft
were prepared from consecutive sections. The scale bars represent 50 μm.

as revealed by sphere-forming or tumor cell transplantation
assays. The fact that inhibitors of TPH1, SERT and any
one of several receptors compromised BTIC activity
suggests that each protein plays a distinct role in BTIC
biology. Whereas the role of TPH1 seems obvious that of
SERT and those of several independent receptors is not yet
clear. The observation that the combination of vilazodone
and docetaxel synergized to shrink breast tumor xenografts
is consistent with the hypothesis that each drug targets
a different but interrelated tumor cell population, likely
BTIC and their non-tumorigenic descendants.
Genetic evidence demonstrating a requirement for
5-HT function to maintain BTIC activity would secure
the role of the serotonergic system in breast cancer, and
provide insight into the biological roles of its individual
components. Interestingly knockout mice homozygous for
genes encoding several of the serotonergic system proteins,
including SLC6A4, have been isolated demonstrating that
individually these genes are not essential for embryonic
development or adult tissue physiology and homeostasis
[34–36].
Hence, we attempted to knockout SLC6A4 in breast
tumor cell lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing
tool with the expectation that cells lacking the gene
might be viable. Whereas we were able to successfully
target 1 of the 2 SLC6A4 alleles in diploid MCF-7 cells,
and 3 of the 4 alleles in tetraploid HCC1954 tumor cells
we were unable to derive a single clone from either
cell line lacking functional SERT among hundreds of
clones that were screened, implying that the gene is
essential for the viability of these breast tumor cell lines
(data not shown). In this regard it is noteworthy that
knockout of Slc6a14, which encodes a transporter for
neutral amino acids including tryptophan, the precursor
of 5-HT, compromises mammary tumorigenesis in a
mouse model of breast cancer [37]. Our current efforts
are centered on conditionally targeting SLC6A4 and the
genes encoding TPH1 and each of the 14 5-HT receptors
in human breast tumor cell lines to learn whether loss of
each gene phenocopies the effect of selective serotonergic
antagonists of their encoded molecular targets.
To learn whether previous functional genomic
screens identified genes encoding serotonergic pathway
components as being essential for the proliferation
of human tumor cell lines in vitro, we mined the data
resulting from genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout
screens in human cancer cell lines [38, 39]. The cell lines
included 2 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines and
2 Burtkitt’s lymphoma cell lines in one study [38], and
a colon carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, glioblastoma
and melanoma cell line in another [39]. All the cell
lines were propagated in serum-containing medium as
adherent cultures and passaged at least 3 times. Under
the conditions of the latter studies none of the genes
encoding serotonergic pathway proteins were identified as
essential for tumor cell proliferation. However, none of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the cell lines investigated were of breast origin. Hence we
mined the data resulting from a recently reported shRNA
dropout screen performed in over 70 breast tumor cell
lines that were propagated as adherent cultures in serumcontaining medium for 2 passages [40]. shRNAs targeting
transcripts encoding TPH1, SERT and many of the 5-HT
receptors statistically significantly dropped out during the
propagation of the breast tumor cell lines in vitro (data not
shown). This latter study is in accord with our unpublished
data suggesting that SLC6A4 is essential for the viability
or proliferation of the MCF-7 and HCC1954 breast tumor
cell lines.
IF and IHC analyses of 5-HT pathway component
expression in breast tumor cell lines revealed their
presence in a fraction of cells that supersedes the
frequency of BTIC reported in these sources [1, 13, 41].
One explanation for this discrepancy is that the extent to
which the 5-HT pathway proteins are expressed differs
between BTIC and their non-tumorigenic progeny. The
latter is suggested by our IHC analyses of PDX, which
revealed that infrequent SERT-positive cells in PDX were
more intensely stained than others. Additional experiments
are required to determine whether both the tumorigenic
and non-tumorigenic tumor cells in PDX and other sources
differentially express the various 5-HT pathway proteins,
and whether their expression correlates with BTIC activity.
A link between 5-HT and breast cancer has been
reported in previous studies. Analysis of 288 breast
tumors revealed increased expression of TPH1 in tumors
compared to normal breast samples, and an association
between increased TPH1 levels and breast cancer
progression [42]. Another study uncovered a correlation
between increased plasma-free 5-HT and the risk of breast
cancer recurrence in a cohort of 29 women [43]. Moreover,
recent analyses of transcriptomic and metabolomic data
from thousands of breast tumor specimens demonstrated a
correspondence between patients predicted to have a poor
prognosis and increased tumor-specific 5-HT production
[44]. Breast tumor recurrence and poor patient prognosis
may be attributable to BTIC, which require 5-HT for their
activity, seed metastases and are refractory to conventional
therapies [45, 46].
Studies pioneered by Horseman and his colleagues
were the first to implicate 5-HT in postnatal mouse
mammary gland development [47, 48]. Initial studies
identified Tph1 as a prolactin target gene [47]. TPH1
transcripts are increased during pregnancy and lactation
leading to increased 5-HT levels in the mammary
epithelium. 5-HT acts in a negative feedback loop to
suppress prolactin stimulation of milk production during
lactation and to initiate involution by inducing epithelial
cell apoptosis [48]. The function of 5-HT requires
5-HT receptor activity because a non-selective receptor
antagonist, methysergide, inhibited the effect of 5-HT
on the expression of milk proteins and 5-HT mediated
initiation of apoptosis [47]. 5-HT also increased the
32111

Oncotarget

synthesis of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP),
which acts on bone to release calcium that ultimately
accumulates in milk. Recent publications demonstrate that
5-HT binding to the 5-HT7 receptors triggers mammary
epithelial cell apoptosis during the involution phase of
postnatal mammary gland development, whereas 5-HT
binding to the 5-HT2B receptor stimulates the expression
of PTHrP from mammary epithelial cells during lactation
[49–53]. Hence 5-HT binding to different receptors in
the mammary gland regulates different cellular processes
likely by activating distinct signaling pathways. By
analogy, our findings of a requirement for multiple 5-HT
receptors for BTIC activity in sphere-forming assays
may reflect the fact that each receptor acts through a
distinct signaling pathway, and that activation of multiple
pathways is required to maintain BTIC activity.
It is noteworthy that the serotonergic system
has been implicated in other malignancies including
lymphoma and leukemia, prostate carcinomas, small cell
lung carcinomas, glioblastomas, bladder carcinomas,
colorectal carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas,
cholangiocarcinomas, choriocarcinomas, carcinoid tumors
and ovarian tumors (reviewed in [54]). Interestingly,
overexpressing cDNAs encoding the 5-HT2C or 5-HT2A
receptors results in the transformation of mouse 3T3
fibroblasts demonstrating that they function as oncogenes
in the focus-forming assay [55, 56]. Consistent with our
findings serotonergic system antagonists, including several
that we independently discovered [17], were recently
found to inhibit sphere formation by glioblastoma cell
lines [57] and to affect the growth of tumor allografts and
xenografts of neuroendocrine origin [58].
Epidemiologic studies have sought to determine
whether SSRIs increase breast cancer recurrence, as a
consequence of findings in experimental rodent models
in the early 1990s suggesting that SSRI increased the
incidence of tumors (reviewed in [59]). However,
subsequent studies found that there is no association
between SSRI use and breast cancer risk in women. To
the best of our knowledge epidemiological studies have
not addressed whether antidepressants reduce the risk
of breast cancer, or whether their use during cytotoxic
anticancer therapies reduces breast cancer recurrence.
The repurposing of serotonergic antagonists to treat
breast cancer will depend in part on whether therapeutic
concentrations can be achieved in patients. Two of the
SSRI we used here (sertraline and vilazodone) have IC50
values in vitro between 1- 2 μM in a diversity of human
breast tumor cell lines. The concentration of sertraline in
the plasma of individuals who were orally administered
200 mg of the drug is 0.19 ug/ml (0.55 μM), which was
achieved between 4.5 - 8.4 hours post administration: the
half-life of the drug is between 24 and 36 hours [60]. The
plasma concentration of sertraline is directly proportional
to the administered oral dose over the range of 20 - 400
mg. Moreover, daily oral doses of 400 mg of sertraline are
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

well tolerated suggesting that a 1μM plasma concentration,
the approximate IC50 of the drug in breast tumor cell lines,
can be achieved in humans [61]. Vilazodone can similarly
achieve plasma concentrations in humans at the IC50
required to inhibit sphere formation in vitro [62]. The fact
that the SSRI we have tested synergize with docetaxel
when used at their respective IC50 values in human breast
tumor cell lines offers the promise that therapeutic doses
of these SSRI can be achieved in breast cancer patients.
Collectively our data imply that 5-HT signaling is
required to maintain BTIC activity and suggests that drugs
affecting the serotonergic system might be repurposed to
treat breast cancer patients in combination with anticancer
therapies to achieve more durable breast cancer remissions
than occur currently. SSRI in particular are among the
most widely prescribed antidepressants, have been
used for decades and are considered safe when used as
prescribed suggesting that their testing in clinical trials as
anticancer drugs may be warranted [63].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Care and treatment of mice
All procedures involving mice were performed with
the approval of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

Patient-derived xenografts
The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board
approved all protocols associated with the collection of
primary human breast tumor samples. Primary patient
breast tumors were processed to yield dispersed cells
and these transplanted into the cleared humanized #4
mammary gland of NOD/SCID gamma mice (NSG) [64].
Tumor xenografts were subsequently propagated in NOD/
SCID mice [14].

Analyses of SLC6A4 transcripts and
copy number
All genomic data was publicly available. Level
3 DNA copy number data for breast tumors were
downloaded from the BROAD Institute portal (https://
gdac.broadinstitute.org/) on June 28, 2016 and level
3 RNA sequencing data (RSEM) for breast tumors and
normal tissues were obtained from the National Cancer
Institute GDC Data Portal (https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.
gov/) on August 22, 2016. GISTIC 2.0, which facilitates
sensitive and confident localization of focal somatic copy
number alterations, was used to estimate the copy number
of SLC6A4 [65]. Sequencing data were normalized with
the TMM normalization method [66] and then transformed
with voom transformation [67]. Thereafter, differential
expression analysis was performed using the limma
package in R [68].

the recommendations of their manufacturers or as we
described previously [17]. Color images were converted to
grayscale, inverted, and their contrast adjusted to optimal
resolution using ImageJ software. An antibody to Ki67
(ABCAM, Cambridge, Mass., USA) was used to identify
proliferating tumor cells, whereas TUNEL assays were
performed to identify apoptotic cells in xenograft sections
as described [27, 30].

Breast tumor cell lines were purchased from the
ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in serumcontaining medium with the recommended supplements.
Breast tumor cell line derived tumorspheres were treated
with trypsin (0.25%) to yield dispersed cells, which
were placed in chemically-defined, serum-free medium
containing B-27, Epidermal Growth Factor, Fibroblast
Growth Factor 2 and heparin to form tumorspheres
[14]. The tumorspheres were passaged every 4 days by
trituration and exposure to trypsin followed by reseeding
the dispersed cells into fresh medium.

Statistical analyses
Assays were repeated in 2 or more biological
experiments with each data point being the average of a
minimum of 3 technical replicates. Where relevant the
figures show the mean +/- the standard error. Differences
among experimental means were analyzed by analysis
of variance (one-way ANOVA) using Graphpad Prism
6 (La Jolla, CA., USA). Significant differences between
individual means were calculated using Tukey’s test. For
Kaplan-Meier survival, significance was determined using
a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Differences were considered
statistically significant if P < 0.05.

Sphere-forming assays
Quantitative sphere-forming assays were performed
as described [17, 27].

IC50 calculations
The IC50 of compounds was calculated using
GraphPad Prism 6 software as described [27, 30]. To aid
IC50 calculations, the vehicle comprised a 1 nanomolar
concentration of the tested compound.

Animal studies

Tumor xenografts were processed to obtain
sections, and IF and IHC analyses of the sections were
performed as described [14, 27, 30, 69, 70]. The proteins
in tumor cell lysates were resolved by electrophoresis in
denaturing conditions in 5-15% gradient polyacrylamide
gels and immunoblots were carried out as described [71].
To identify human SERT in tumor cell lysates we used a
polyclonal antibody to SERT (Alomone Labs; Jerusalem,
Israel), elicited by immunization of rabbits with a peptide
corresponding to amino acids 388-400. The polyclonal
antibody was also used to detect SERT in breast tumor
xenograft sections as described [17]. A polyclonal antibody
to TPH1 (LifeSpan BioSciences, Inc.; Burlington, ON,
Canada) generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide
(amino acids 231-280) was used to detect the protein in
breast tumor cell lines [17]. A mouse monoclonal antibody
to 5-HT (Novus Biologicals; Oakville, ON, Canada) was
used to detect the neurotransmitter in breast tumor cell
lines [17]. Western blots IF and IHC with primary and
secondary antibodies were performed in accordance with
