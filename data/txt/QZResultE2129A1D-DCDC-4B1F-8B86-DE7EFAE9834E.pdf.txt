ABSTRACT
Cancer heterogeneity and microenvironmental aspects within a tumor
are considered key factors influencing resistance of carcinoma cells to distinct
chemotherapeutical agents. We evaluated a high concentration of metformin in
combination with gemcitabine on a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model using 6606PDA
cells. We observed reduced tumor size and reduced cancer cell proliferation after
three weeks of chemotherapy with either compound and noticed an additive effect
between gemcitabine and metformin on tumor weight. Interestingly, distinct areas
of the carcinoma responded differently to either compound. Metformin inhibited the
proliferation of cancer cells close to the desmoplastic reaction, whereas gemcitabine
inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells mainly 360–570 µm distant to the
desmoplastic reaction. Indeed, co-culture of pancreatic stellate cells with 6606PDA,
7265PDA or MIA PaCa-2 cells increased gemcitabine resistance. Metformin resistance,
however, was increased by high glucose concentration in the medium. Other factors
such as hypoxia or the pH of the medium had no influence on gemcitabine or
metformin induced inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. These data demonstrate a
spatial heterogeneity in drug resistance within pancreatic adenocarcinomas and that
microenvironmental aspects such as supply of glucose and the presence of pancreatic
stellate cells regulate cancer cell sensitivity towards metformin or gemcitabine.

INTRODUCTION

These studies demonstrated that metformin at a low dose
typical for glycemic control is unlikely to benefit patients
with pancreatic cancer when used in combination with
traditional cytostatic agents [7, 8]. However a subgroup of
patients with high metformin concentration (> 1 mg/L) in
the blood seemed to have an improved survival [7].
The efficacy of chemotherapies is often jeopardized
by the heterogeneity of carcinomas [9, 10]. Heterogeneity
may exist between carcinomas of different patients, but
also within a single carcinoma [11]. This intratumoral
heterogeneity can be caused by cell intrinsic mechanisms
such as the accumulation of distinct sets of mutations
in distinct subpopulations of cancer cells [12]. Another
prominent cause for intratumoral heterogeneity is the
influence of the microenvironment on cancer cells [10].
For example, certain aspects of the microenvironment such

Although multiple chemotherapies for the
treatment of pancreatic cancer have been evaluated, the
5-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer patients is still
only 7% [1]. For adjuvant therapy chemotherapeutic
regiments such as gemcitabine or 5-Fluoruracil with
follinic acid are recommended [2]. For the treatment of
advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer gemcitabine
in combination with nab-paclitaxel or a combination
known as FOLFIRINOX (5-fluoruracil, leucovorin,
oxaliplatin, irinotecan) can be used [3, 4]. Since all
chemotherapies offer modest mortality benefit, novel
combinatorial chemotherapies continue to be tested [5, 6].
Lately the benefit of metformin, a traditional diabetes
type II medication, has been evaluated in clinical studies.

as the presence of a tumor stroma can restrict the ability of
chemotherapeutic agents to reach the carcinoma cells and
cause thereby drug resistance [13–15]. These observations
already lead to the development of experimental drugs,
with the goal to reduce the tumor stroma [13–15].
However, the benefit of disrupting the tumor stroma
is highly controversial [13–17]. Understanding the
interaction of cancer heterogeneity, microenvironmental
aspects and drug resistance will continue to be important
to develop novel therapies [9, 10, 18].
In this study we treated pancreatic adenocarcinomas
with gemcitabine and a high metformin dose and observed
local heterogeneity in the inhibition of cancer cell
proliferation in response to each drug. Based on these
in vivo observations, we characterized microenvironmental
aspects, such as glucose supply, pH, hypoxia and the
presence of pancreatic stellate cells on drug resistance of
pancreatic cancer cells.

only a moderate effect on cancer cell proliferation
(Figure 3A–3C). When evaluating the carcinomas
360–570 µm from the desmoplastic reaction gemcitabine
as well as gemcitabine plus metformin treatment reduced
the number of proliferating cancer cells significantly,
whereas metformin treatment had only a moderate effect
on cancer cell proliferation (Figure 3D). Thus, local
differences in the proliferation rate of carcinoma cells, in
response to gemcitabine and metformin treatment, can be
observed in vivo.

Expression of gemcitabine and metformin
transport proteins
We also evaluated the expression of proteins
involved in the transport of gemcitabine or metformin.
6606PDA cells expressed metformin transporter proteins
such as the organic cation transporter OCT1/2 with a
theoretical molecular weight of 62 kDa (Supplementary
Figure 1A). The expression of plasma membrane
monoamine transporter (PMAT) with a theoretical
molecular weight of 58 kDa was detected in the intestine,
but in 6606PDA cells two proteins with an apparent
molecular weight of 70 kDa and 55 kDa were observed
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Possibly these proteins might
be splice variants or glycosylated forms of PMAT. OCT1/2
as well as PMAT was detected throughout 6606PDA
derived carcinomas in vivo (Supplementary Figure 1C
and 1D). This suggests that the observed metformin
induced reduction of cancer cell proliferation primarily
0–210 µm close to the desmoplastic reaction cannot be
explained by the expression of these two transport proteins.
In addition, we evaluated the expression of
known gemcitabine transport proteins. We observed that
nucleoside import proteins such as the concentrative
nucleoside transporters CNT1 with a theoretical
molecular weight of 71 kDa as well as CNT3 with a
theoretical molecular weight of 78 kDa were expressed
by 6606PDA cells (Figure 4A and 4B). The full length
of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1)
with a theoretical molecular weight of 50 kDa was very
moderately expressed in 6606PDA cells (Figure 4C). A
known functional isoform, however, called mENT1∆11
[21] with a theoretical molecular weight of 39 kDa, was
highly expressed in this cell line (Figure 4C). CNT1 as
well as CNT3 was expressed throughout the carcinomas
in vivo (Figure 4D and 4E). ENT1, however, was
mainly expressed close to the desmoplastic reaction
(Figure 4F). Since ENT1 is implicated in re-exporting
gemcitabine from cells [22], ENT1 expression close to the
desmoplastic reaction might reduce gemcitabine induced
inhibition of cell proliferation in this area of the tumor.
Thus, the expression pattern of gemcitabine, but not of
metformin transporter proteins might explain the observed
local differences in cell proliferation in response to these
two therapies.

RESULTS
Gemcitabine and metformin reduce cell
proliferation in distinct carcinoma regions
In order to evaluate the effect of metformin in
combination with gemcitabine on the pathophysiology of
pancreatic cancer in vivo, we injected 6606PDA cells into
the pancreas of mice. Distinct mouse cohorts were sham
treated or injected intraperitoneally with gemcitabine,
metformin or both substances for three weeks (Figure 1A).
Gemcitabine application was effective, since it reduced
the number of leucocytes (Figure 1B). The application
of metformin resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in the
concentration of blood glucose (Figure 1C). After three
weeks of gemcitabine as well as metformin application
reduced tumor weight was observed when compared to
sham treated mice (Figure 2A). Treating mice with both
substances lead to an even larger reduction of the tumor
weight (Figure 2A). Independent of treatment, all tumors
had similar histological features as described previously
[19, 20]. They were cyst-like, completely encapsulated by
fibroblast like cells and had few necrotic areas close to the
encapsulation (0–120 µm distance from the desmoplastic
reaction), but more necrotic areas at 360–570 µm distance
from the desmoplastic reaction (Figure 2B and 2C).
However, major differences in cell death between distinct
cohorts of mice were neither observed in close proximity
to the desmoplastic reaction nor at 360–570 µm distance
to the tumor stroma (Figure 2D and 2E).
Interestingly, inhibition of proliferation by
gemcitabine and metformin was dependent on the distance
to the desmoplastic reaction (Figure 3). When evaluating
the carcinomas 0–210 µm close to the desmoplastic
reaction metformin as well as gemcitabine plus metformin
treatment reduced the number of proliferating cancer
cells significantly, whereas gemcitabine treatment had

inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, when evaluating
6606PDA or 7265PDA cells (Figure 5B and 5C). When
studying MIA PaCa-2 cells we also did not observe a major
influence of oxygen concentration on gemcitabine induced
inhibition of proliferation (Normoxia: 78.8/74.6–85.1;
hypoxia: 76.9/68.2–82.6 median/interquartile range in
% inhibition). However, all three cell lines modestly
increased their proliferation under hypoxic conditions
(6606PDA: normoxia 0.95/0.87–1.19, hypoxia 1.14/1.00–
1.36; 7265PDA: normoxia 1.10/0.98–1.14, hypoxia
1.16/1.09–1.22; MIA PaCa-2: normoxia 0.78/0.67–0.88,
hypoxia 0.94/0.80–1.12 median/interquartile range in
absorption at 450 nm). In addition, we explored, if glucose
concentration in the medium influences the resistance
of pancreatic cancer cells towards gemcitabine. High
glucose concentration increased the proliferation of
untreated 6606PDA cells (Figure 5D). However, glucose
concentration had no major influence on gemcitabine
induced inhibition of cancer cell proliferation of 6606PDA
or 7265PDA cells (Figure 5E). Glucose concentration had
also no major influence on gemcitabine induced inhibition
of cancer cell proliferation of MIA PaCa-2 cells (high
glucose: 30.7/13.3–37.7, low glucose: 36.2/24.0–45.1
median/interquartile range in % inhibition of proliferation).
Another microenvironmental aspect, which could
be different between distinct areas of the carcinoma,
was the pH of the tissue. Indeed, blotting cryo-sectioned

To explore the option if tumor stroma cells might
influence the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells towards
gemcitabine, we co-cultured pancreatic stellate cells (PSC)
with 6606PDA cells. PSCs were treated with mitomycine
C in order to inhibit their proliferation. A co-culture of
6606PDA cells and mitomycine C treated PSCs resulted
in modest increase of the proliferation rate when compared
to 6606PDA cells (6606PDA: 1.786/1.371–2.013
6606PDA + PSC: 1.880/1.650–2.54 PSC: 0.021/.0.19–
0.039 median/interquartile range in absorption at 450 nm).
However, gemcitabine administration to 6606PDA cells
co-cultured with PSCs resulted in a significantly weaker
inhibition of cell proliferation when compared to 6606PDA
cell, which were grown without PSCs (Figure 5A). We also

significantly weaker inhibition of cell proliferation when
compared to carcinoma cells, which were grown without
PSCs (Figure 5A). We also investigated if hypoxia
influences the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells towards
gemcitabine. Hypoxia induced the expression of lactate
dehydrogenase A, as described in other cell lines [23],
but failed to have any influence on gemcitabine induced

carcinomas on a pH-paper revealed a higher pH in the
inside of the tumor, which was characterized by an
extensive central necrosis, when compared to vital
tissue close to the rim of the carcinoma (Figure 6A).
The average pH in the central necrosis was 7.8 whereas
the pH in the vital tissue on the outside of the tumor
was significantly lower (Figure 6B). We evaluated,
if the pH of the medium influences the resistance of
pancreatic cancer cells towards gemcitabine in vitro.
A ten-fold difference in the H+ ion concentration in

the medium had remarkable little influence on the
proliferation of untreated 6606PDA cells (Figure 6C)
or on gemcitabine induced inhibition of cancer cell
proliferation (Figure 6D). Differences in the H+ ion
concentration in the medium had also little influence on
the proliferation of untreated 7265PDA cells (Figure 6E)
or on gemcitabine induced inhibition of cancer cell
proliferation (Figure 6F). No major influence of the pH
value on proliferation was also noticed when studying
MIA PaCa-2 cells (data not shown).

medium of low glucose concentration was also observed
with 7265PDA cells (Figure 7C). However, this result
was not confirmed when evaluating MIA PaCa-2 cells
(metformin: high glucose 34.4/24.6–36.5, low glucose
11.8/3.2–24.6; metformin plus gemcitabine: high glucose

cells towards metformin is not influenced by H+ ion

decreased by low glucose concentration in the medium.

of 125 mg/kg metformin can be administered safely in
C57Bl/6J mice, but that the administration of 250 mg/kg
can have adverse effects (at least when administered
in form of ip injections). Considering that in multiple
preclinical studies more than 50 mg/kg metformin very
consistently reduced tumor weight [24–28], it might be
worth pursuing clinical studies with a higher dose of
metformin.
So far no definite mechanism has been identified
how metformin inhibits cancer cell proliferation. One
favored option is that metformin inhibits oxidative
phosphorylation in mitochondria, which leads to an energy
crisis within cells [29]. In response to this energy stress
adaptive responses of the cell reduces energy consuming
processes, such as proliferation [30]. We observed,
however, that hypoxia, which usually also causes an
energy crisis in cells, did not have a significant influence
on the inhibition of 6606PDA, 7265PDA or MIA PaCa-2
cell proliferation by metformin (Figure 7A and data not
shown). These data are consistent with the hypothesis
that many carcinoma cells produce energy predominantly
via enhanced glycolysis even under aerobic conditions
[31]. This Warburg effect might also occur in 6606PDA
cells, since we observed that this cell line produced
only about 18% less lactate under normoxic conditions
when compared to hypoxic conditions (data not shown).
Nevertheless, these considerations raise the question how
metformin, a well characterized inhibitor of the respiratory
chain complex I in mitochondria [32, 33], inhibits cell
proliferation independent of oxygene supply. Either one
has to assume that 1% oxygene is sufficient for some
oxidative phosphorylation to occur and its inhibition by
metformin reduces cell proliferation, or metformin inhibits
cancer cell proliferation by modulating key processes
completely distinct to the inhibition of the respiratory
chain such as inhibition of hexokinase or inhibition of
gylcerophosphate dehydrogenase [34, 35].
Interestingly, the presented in vivo data demonstrate
that metformin inhibits cancer cell proliferation in a
spatially distinct area of the carcinoma when compared
to gemcitabine (Figure 3). This spatial heterogeneity
in the response to two distinct drugs causes an additive
effect on tumor growth (Figures 2A and 3). Combinatorial
therapies have been defined to work in two distinct ways:
i) one agent reinforces the action of another agent, or ii)
two drugs may combine to exert effects that are distinct
from either individual compound [36]. These classical
assumptions how combinatorial therapies work are based
on the idea that distinct drugs inhibit identical cancer
cells by different mechanisms. The presented data,
however, demonstrate that distinct agents might also have
a combinatorial effect on the tumor by targeting distinct
areas of a carcinoma. Pursuing combinatorial therapies
to target distinct subpopulations of a carcinoma might be
a promising option for the future. However, appropriate
animal models must be developed for this purpose.

DISCUSSION
The presented in vivo data demonstrate that
gemcitabine inhibits cancer cell proliferation primarily in
cancer cells that are situated distant to the desmoplastic
reaction in a more central position of cyst like carcinomas
(Figure 3). Usually the function of the desmoplastic
reaction is described as barrier, which blocks access of
gemcitabine to cancer cells and thereby causes resistance
to this drug [13–15]. However, the observed spatial
heterogeneity in response to gemcitabine in the carcinomas
of the presented mouse model cannot be explained by
this hypothesis, since carcinoma regions in the inside of
the tumors, which should even be better shielded from
gemcitabine, are most sensitive to gemcitabine (Figure 3).
Our data rather suggest a more active role of the
desmoplastic reaction in conferring gemcitabine resistance
to carcinoma cells. This hypothesis is supported by in vitro
data demonstrating that co-culturing pancreatic stellate
cells with 6606PDA cells or other pancreatic cancer cell
lines reduces gemcitabine induced inhibition of cancer cell
proliferation, although cancer cells were in free contact to
gemcitabine supplemented medium (Figure 5A–5C).
While gemcitabine is well established as a
therapeutical agent for the treatment of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, the benefit of metformin is highly
disputed. Many experimental studies in mice used a
high dose of metformin, such as 125 mg/kg per day [24],
150 mg/kg per day [25] or 250 mg/kg per day [26] and
observed reduced growth of pancreatic cancer. Clinical
studies, however, demonstrated that metformin at a
low dose typical for glycemic control (up to 2 g/patient
per day) is unlikely to benefit patients with pancreatic
cancer [7, 8]. However a subgroup of patients with high
metformin concentration in the blood seemed to have
an improved survival [7]. In our study we used a high
dose of 250 mg/kg metformin per day for the first week
and observed in 25% of gemcitabine plus metformin
treated mice and 43% of metformin treated mice a
strong reduction of the blood glucose concentration (0.5
to 3.9 mM) on day 14. We therefore reduced the dose
of metformin in the following two weeks to 125 mg/kg
per day. This resulted in a recovery of the blood glucose
concentration in these mice. This suggests that a daily dose

Cell culture

Western blots

The murine cell line, 6606PDA and 7265PDA were
a gift of Prof. Tuveson (University of Cambridge, UK) and
were grown in DMEM high glucose medium (Biochrom
GmbH, Berlin, Germany) as previously described [19, 20].
The human MIA PaCa-2 cells were ordered from ATCC
(LGC Standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany). The PSCs
were isolated from the pancreas of C57BL/6J mice by
collagenase digestion of the organ and by Nycodenz
density gradient centrifugation as previously described
[37]. These cells were expanded in Iscove’s-medium
(Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with
17% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% non-essential amino
acids, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for
one to two weeks. All experiments were performed with
passaging the cells no more than 2 times.

Western blots were performed by separating cell
lysate on SDS polyacryl gels and transferring the proteins
to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Immobilon-P;
Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) as described previously
[19]. The membranes were blocked with 2.5% (wt/vol.)
BSA or 5% (wt/vol.) milk powder (only for the analysis of
OCT1/2) and incubated overnight at 4°C with a goat antiCNT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA, code
sc48457, dilution: 200×), rabbit anti-CNT3 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, code sc134529, dilution: 1000×), rabbit

Aachen, Germany, code ABIN754948, dilution: 1000×),
rabbit-anti-OCT1/2 (Antikörper-online, code ABIN754948,

by incubation with a secondary peroxidase linked antirabbit (Cell Signaling, code 7074, dilution: 1000×), or
anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2020, dilution:
5000×) antibody. For analysis of β-actin production,
membranes were stripped, blocked by 2.5% (wt/vol.) BSA
and incubated with mouse anti-β-actin antibody (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, codeA5441, dilution: 20000×)
followed by peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA; code A9044, dilution: 60000×).
Protein production was visualized by luminol-enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL plus; GE Healthcare, Munich,
Germany) and digitalised with Chemi-Doc XRS System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany).

Evaluation of proliferation in vitro
For evaluating cell proliferation all cells were seeded
in a 96 well plate and grown in either DMEM high glucose
medium (Biochrom GmbH) or as indicated in Figures 5D,
5E and 7C in low glucose medium (Dulbeccos MEM from
Biochrom after adding 0,5 g/L glucose). Both media were
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For co-culture
experiments of PSCs with 6606PDA, 7265PDA or MIA
PaCa-2 cells (Figure 5A), the proliferation of PSCs was
stopped by treating them with 10 µg/ml mitomycine D
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) for 2 hours, followed by
washing the cells twice with PBS. For some experiments
(Figure 6C–6F and Figure 7B) DMEM high glucose
medium (Biochrom GmbH) was adjusted to pH 6.8 or
pH 7.8 with 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH. The media were
retitrated until the pH remained stable after equilibrating
the medium in a tissue culture incubator for 24 hours. In
order to mimic lactate production in the carcinoma, the
medium with pH 6.8 was also supplemented with 10 mM
lactate (Sigma-Aldrich). For growing cells under hypoxic
conditions, the cell culture dishes were placed 24 hours
after seeding the cells in an Innova CO-48 incubator (New
Brunswick Scientific Co, Edison Edison, USA) under
1% oxygene supply. In all experiments 6606PDA and
7265PDA cells were treated 24 hours after seeding with
control media, 100 nM gemcitabine, 20 mM metformin
or 100 nM gemcitabine plus 20 mM metformin. MIA
PaCa-2 cells were treated with control media, 25 nM
gemcitabine, 20 mM metformin or 25 nM gemcitabine
plus 20 mM metformin. The cells were treated with these
agents for 24 hours (glucose experiments: Figures 5D
and 7C; PSC experiments: Figure 5A, pH experiments:
Figure 6C–6F and Figure 7B) or 72 hours (hypoxia
experiments: Figure 5C and 7A) and the BrdU labeling
reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was
added within the last 24 hours. The incorporation of BrdU

The syngeneic orthotopic carcinoma model
Male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in our local
animal facility. As published previously, laparotomy was
performed on anesthetized mice (1.2–2.5% isoflurane),
2.5 × 105 carcinoma cells were injected into the pancreas
head, and the abdominal cavity was closed by sutures [20].
For pain relief 5 mg/kg carprofen (Pfizer GmbH, Berlin,
Germany) was injected (sc) before surgery and 800 mg/L
metamizol (Ratiopharm GmbH, Ulm, Germany) was
added to the drinking water until euthanasia of the mice.
Distinct mouse cohorts were either sham treated with an
appropriate vehicle (PBS, ip), ip injected with gemcitabine
(50 mg/kg) twice a week, ip injected with metformin
(250 mg/kg metformin daily from day 8 to day 15; 125 mg/kg
metformin daily from day 16 to day 29), or ip injected
with a corresponding dose of gemcitabine plus metformin
over a period of three weeks (Figure 1). For isolating
the tumors animals were anesthetized with 90 mg/kg
ketamine (bela-pharm, Vechta, Germany) and 7 mg/kg
xylazine (Bayer Health Care, Leverkusen, Germany). All

the median, the 25th and 75th percentiles in the form
of a box, and the 5th and 95th percentiles as whiskers.
The significance of differences was evaluated using a
Mann-Whitney rank-sum test followed by the correction
for the accumulation of the α error by considering
the number of meaningful comparisons (Bonferroni
correction). Differences with P ≤ 0.05, divided by the
number of meaningful comparisons, were considered to
be significant. Differences with P ≤ 0.08, divided by the
number of meaningful comparisons, were considered to
indicate a tendency.

Analysis of the blood and tissue
The blood glucose concentrations were measured
with the blood glucose meter Contour (Bayer Vital,
Leverkusen, Germany) on day 14 and day 29 of the
experimental schema in Figure 1A (1.5 hours after
metformin injection). The concentration of leucocytes
in the blood was determined on day 29 with the
automated hematology analyzer Sysmex KX 21 (Sysmex
Cooperation, Kobe, Japan). The tissue was sampled on
day 29 and processed as described previously [19]. The
histology of the tumors was evaluated on haematoxylin
and eosin (H/E) stained paraffin tissue sections. For
visualizing the pH in the carcinoma, we invented a new
method: In a CM1850 cryostate (Leica Mikrosysteme
Vertrieb GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) 10 µm sections
were cut and placed on white writing paper, which was
freshly soaked in 1% bromothymolblue solution (SCS
GmbH, Bonn, Germany). Prior to soaking the paper in the
indicator solution, the color of the solution was adjusted
with 1 M NaOH until a green color was observed. Photos
were taken within 15 seconds of placing the tissue section
onto the soaked paper. In order to measure the pH, the
liquid within the central cyst of the tumor was removed
with a syringe and the remaining tissue was minced. Solid
particles in liquid and minced tissue were removed by
centrifugation and the pH in the supernatant was measured
by a RapidLab Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare GmbH,
Erlangen, Germany).
