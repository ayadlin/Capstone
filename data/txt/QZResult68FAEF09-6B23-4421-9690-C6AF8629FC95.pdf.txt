ABSTRACT
Molecule-targeted therapy has achieved great progress in cancer therapy.
Effective drug combinations are one way to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and
combat resistance. Here, we determined the effect of the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor
BEZ235 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) on human
breast cancer. We demonstrated that the combination of BEZ235 and TSA results
in significant synergistic growth inhibition of multiple breast cancer cell lines.
Mechanistic studies revealed that the combined therapy induced apoptosis in a
caspase-dependent manner, which might be related to the further depression of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Additionally, co-treatment with BEZ235 and
TSA enhanced autophagic cell death by up-regulating the expression of LC3B-II and
Beclin-1. The vivo tumour modelling studies revealed that BEZ235 combined with TSA
blocked tumour growth without noticeable side effects. These data suggest that the
combination of BEZ235 and TSA may be a new selective strategy, which may have
significant clinical application in the treatment of breast cancer patients.

techniques is found in up to 50-60% of papillary serous
breast cancers [5]. Approximately 25% of breast cancer
tumours have mutations in the gene encoding the kinase
active p110α subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA), with the majority
of mutations located in the kinase domain. There was
no significant relation between PIK3CA with receptor
status of HER-2 and ER/PR [6]. The expression of
phosphorylated 4EBP1, a downstream effector of PI3K
in breast tumour specimens, has been associated with
poor prognosis [7]. These findings have encouraged the
development of several different inhibitors targeting the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, many of which are either in
or approaching clinical trials [8–9]. BEZ235, a novel
therapeutic agent that targets two molecules, including
PI3K and mTOR in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [10],
has demonstrated efficacy as an anti-tumour agent in vitro
and in vivo in several cancers [3, 4, 11-12]. Recently, in

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the second major cause of
cancer-related death for women in world-wide [1]. The
survival rates of patients with recurrences or metastases
have not significantly meliorated, although numerous
improvements in prevention, surgical resection and
adjuvant chemoradiotherapy have caused a diminution in
total mortality of breast cancer [2], underscoring the need
for better strategies for both prevention and therapy.
The
phosphoinositol-3-kinase/serine-threonine
protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/
Akt/mTOR) signalling pathway, which plays important
biological roles in normal cellular physiology, has been
demonstrated to be activated in breast cancer [3–4].

combined treatments with melphalan, doxorubicin, and
bortezomib, BEZ235 showed synergistic and additive
effects on cell growth inhibition in multiple cancer cells
[13–14], suggesting its potential clinical activity combined
with chemotherapeutic agents.
Epigenetic modifications, including dysregulated
protein acetylation, affect signalling pathways and
gene expression, which accelerate drug resistance
and tumourigenesis [15]. It has been demonstrated
that histone deacetylase (HDAC) is overexpressed in
multiple cancers, including prostate cancer, pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer, indicating
that HDAC inhibitors are promising compounds for
the therapy of proliferative diseases [16–17]. As the
most potent reversible HDAC inhibitors, TSA is most
commonly used for preclinical studies, serving as panHDAC inhibitors [18]. The antitumor effect of TSA may
induce cell death via mitochondria dependent pathway or
deregulate histone acetylation at centromeres in mitosis,
causing apoptosis and abnormal chromosomal segregation
[19]. According to a report, short treatment with HDAC
inhibitors earlier than exposure to antitumor medicines
can raise medicaments noxiousness, still in cells that are
intrinsically resistant to these medicines [20], indicating
that targeting multiple points of various pathways may
lead to enhanced therapeutic activity.
Previous studies suggested that combining a PI3K/
Akt/mTOR inhibitor and HDAC inhibitors maybe more
effectual than single agents in a number of cancer cells
[21–22], which represents a translatable and promising
approach to cancer therapy. Our recent research also
revealed that co-treatment BEZ235 with TSA exerted
a synergistic inhibition on NSCLC [23]. However, a
preclinical investigation of combining BEZ235 with TSA
in breast cancer has not yet been reported. In this study,
we investigated the joint inhibitory properties of BEZ235
and TSA in various subtypes of breast cancer cells and a
xenograft model and the underlying mechanism.

μM were less sensitive to BEZ235. Additionally, MDAMB-468, MCF7 and SKBR3 cells were more sensitive
to TSA treatment, with IC50 values below 0.5 μM, while
MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468 and T47D cells had IC50
values higher than 0.5 μM (Table 1).
Either BEZ235 or TSA can significantly inhibit the
proliferation of breast cancer cells according to the MTT
assay results; therefore, we further tested the combination
of BEZ235 and TSA for a possible synergistic killing
effect on breast cancer cells. The combination index (CI)
was used to decide whether the combined treatment of
drugs is synergistic, additive, or antagonistic by the Chou
and Talalay method [24]. As represented in Table 1 and
Figure 1B, the results indicated that rather than simple
additive killing, the combination of BEZ235 and TSA
exerted a highly synergistic cytotoxic effect on MCF-7
cells with a CI value below 0.7. Similarly, a synergistic
effect of BEZ235 plus TSA was also observed in T47D
cells and MDA-MB-231, with no correlation with ER, PR
and HER2 status.
To further confirm the potential inhibitory property
of co-treatment with BEZ235 and TSA on breast cancer
cells, we aimed to ascertain if the combination might
inhibit colony formation of breast cancer cells. After 14
days of growth in the combination drug group, fewer and
smaller colonies were counted compared with either the
control or single drug groups in MCF-7, T47D and MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 1C). These results, along with the
viability data, confirmed the synergistic antitumor effect
of BEZ235 and TSA combination on these breast cancer
cells.

Genome-wide analysis of BEZ235 and/or TSA
induced differential gene expressions in breast
cancer cells by gene chip
To estimate the potential interaction of PI3K/mTOR
signalling pathways and HDAC inhibition in a more
comprehensive manner, a transcriptome analysis was
performed utilizing microarrays after 24 hours of treatment
with BEZ235 and/or TSA in MCF-7 cells. After filtering
and normalization, gene expression alteration in samples
was calculated. Microarrays assess concurrent alterations
in transcription levels on an individual basis, leading to
a long list of genes which have changed transcript levels
significantly compared to control cells. Here, we found
747 up-regulated and 964 down-regulated genes (fold
change ≥2.0) in the combination treatment group of MCF7 cells, and the numbers of genes induced was much larger
than that induced by BEZ235 (585 up-regulated and 353
down-regulated) or TSA (401 up-regulated and 403 downregulated) (Figure 2).
These alterations in gene expression, however,
do not exist as independent actions within the cell but
are dominated in a co-ordinated manner and always
interconnected. Pathway Analysis is an impartial approach

RESULTS
Synergistic anti-tumour effect of
BEZ235 and TSA
Six breast cancer cell lines, including T47D, SKBR-3, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and
MDA-MB-453, were exposed for 24, 48 or 72 hours to
increasing concentrations of BEZ235 or TSA ranging
from 0.1 to 1 μM, respectively. Our results showed that
the proliferation abilities were significantly decreased
by BEZ235 or TSA in all the above breast cancer cells
(Figure 1A). The results also exhibited that MCF-7, MDAMB-231 and T47D cells were more sensitive to BEZ235
treatment, with IC50 values below 0.1 μM after 48 h of
incubation. In contrast, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453
and SK-BR-3 with IC50 values ranging from 0.147 to 1.8

expressed are enriched in some particular pathways,
providing insight into the biological significance of the
changes that are observed. According to all pathways in
the genetic information (KEGG, BIOCARTA), pathway
enrichment analysis of differential genes and hierarchical
cluster analysis were performed. Importantly, in sorting

differentially expressed genes pursuant to their differential
expression level, our data clearly revealed that these focus
genes have functions in cancers, cell death and survival,
cellular development, and development disorders.
The combination group cells had significantly higher
expression levels of genes associated with apoptosis and
autophagy such as BAX (encoding bax), CASP9 (encoding

groups treated with either BEZ235 or TSA alone.

Caspase 9), MAP1LC3B (encoding LC3B) and but lower
expression levels of genes, such as BCL-2 (encoding Bcl2) than the other group.

As shown in Figure 4A, co-treatment with BEZ235
and TSA induced more apoptosis of breast cancer cells
compared to treatment with either agent alone (p <0.05).
The apoptotic rate in T47D cells treated with BEZ235 and
TSA was 33.23%, and it was significantly higher than that
in the BEZ235 group (8.18%) and TSA group (10.03%)
after treatment for 48 h. Similarly, in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells, co-treatment of BEZ235 and TSA resulted
in an increased apoptosis rate compared with other groups.
The Hoechst 33342 staining results revealed that
the apoptotic cells were more frequently observed in
breast cancer cells treated with the BEZ235 and TSA
combination compared with the groups treated with
BEZ235 or TSA alone (Figure 4B). Additionally, the
cells possessed marked morphological changes in the
combination group than either the BEZ235 or TSA
group. The cells of the control group showed round and
homogeneous nuclei; however, following co-treatment
with BEZ235 and TSA for 48 h, alterations in the size,
shape, and structure of the cell nuclei were observed as
well as the condensed chromatin and cell shrinkage.
Moreover, western blot data showed that the
expression level of Bcl-2 was down-regulated following
BEZ235 and TSA co-treatment, and Bax expression was
up-regulated under the same conditions (Figure 4C).
Importantly, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was significantly
decreased, which suggests that the Bcl-2/Bax plays an
important role in breast cancer cell progression regulated
by the BEZ235 and TSA combination. Our data also
showed that cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9

Effect of BEZ235 and TSA treatment on PI3K/
mTOR signalling
To elucidate the signalling pathway inhibition of the
combination of TSA and BEZ235 in breast cancer cells,
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway molecules were detected after
48 h of drug treatment. As shown in Figure 3, the PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 reduced the phosphorylation
of S6 (S240/244), Akt (S473), mTOR (S2448), and
4EBP1 (S65) in the cultured MCF-7, T47D and MDAMB-231 cells. Although TSA treatment alone did not
significantly affect PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway protein
phosphorylation, if in combination with BEZ235, it further
inhibited the phosphorylation of S6(S240/244), Akt (S473)
and 4EBP1 (S65) in various degree in breast cancer cells
relative to single treatments.

Co-treatment with BEZ235 and TSA
synergistically induce apoptosis signalling
To determine if the synergistic growth inhibition of
BEZ235 and TSA results from apoptosis, we used flow
cytometry, Hoechst 33342 staining, and western blot to
observe nuclear fragmentation and apoptosis related
protein expression in T47D, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells treated with BEZ235 and/or TSA.

PI3K/mTOR pathway in breast cancer cells MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 co-treated with BEZ235 and TSA for 48h. Each protein was
analyzed in triplicate, and a representative experiment is shown.

and poly ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) were all
increased in breast cancer cells. These data suggest that
cell apoptosis induced by dual drug treatment was caspasedependent, indicating that the combination of BEZ235 and
TSA exerts an anti-breast cancer effect through not only
the mitochondrial pathway but also the death receptor
pathway.

breast cancer cells. Using western blot, we detected
increased levels of LC3B-II, a lysosome-bound form of
LC3B, in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells exposed
to BEZ235 and TSA (Figure 5A). Beclin1 expression was
also significantly increased at the same time, indicating
the autophagy induced by the dual drug treatment in breast
cancer cells. Moreover, in agreement with western blot
data, we observed enhanced punctate staining of FITCLC3B in cells when exposed to BEZ235 and TSA cotreatment (Figure 5B), compared with either single drug
group or the control group, suggesting the formation of
autophagosomes. Collectively, these results demonstrate
that the combination of BEZ235 and TSA exerted antibreast cancer effects through inducing not only apoptosis
but also autophagy.

To explore the interaction between autophagy and
apoptosis in more detail, we detected the immunoblotting
of LC3B, caspase-3 and PARP-1 of breast cancer cells
with 3-MA pre-treatment before combined BEZ235
and TSA treatment, an inhibitor of autophagy. Here, we
found that with the addition of 3-MA, the expression of
LC3B-II in the dual drug group was lower than in the
absence of 3-MA, indicating that autophagy induced by
the combination of BEZ235 and TSA was blocked by
3-MA. More importantly, we found that the apoptotic
executioners, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP-1, increased
significantly in the presence of 3-MA (Figure 5C).
Collectively, these observations suggested that as a parallel
response to the BEZ235 and TSA combination strategy,
autophagy accelerated the cell death of breast cancer cells
in addition to apoptosis.

As shown in Figure 6, treatment with BEZ235 or TSA
alone significantly reduced tumour growth, resulting in
lower mean tumour volume of the tumours, compared
to control treatment (vehicle alone). Notably, combined
treatment with BEZ235 and TSA completely abrogated
the growth of tumour xenografts, an effect significantly
superior to treatment with BEZ235 or TSA as a single
agent. After approximately 35 days of treatment, neither
a single agent nor the combination of BEZ235 and TSA
caused weight loss or other toxicity to the nude mice at
the doses that were used in both models. Moreover, we
confirmed that the effect of treatment with these agents
together was associated with marked tumour necrosis by
H&E staining. IHC staining also showed lower expression
of Ki-67 and p-S6 and higher expression of LC3B in the
co-treatment group than in the other groups, which was
consistent with the in vitro findings.

DISCUSSION

To better recapitulate the clinical setting, we tested
the effect of treatment with BEZ235 and/or TSA on the
growth of established tumour xenografts of MDA-MB-231
cells implanted in the mammary gland pad of nude mice.

The understanding of breast cancer potential biology
has risen exponentially recently, and improvements in
molecular biology have unveiled a substantial sum of

genomic aberrations. Recent researches unveiled that
many aberrations centered on certain key pathways of
signal transduction in cancer cell, including PI3K/Akt/
mTOR and epigenetic alterations. Future strategies in
consequence are likely to utilize combined two or more
targeted drugs to further decelerate the traffic of signals
pathways, therefore, achieve optimum and undergone
clinical benefit.
Recent studies indicate that combined PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor with HDAC inhibitor may be more efficacious
than single drug in some cancer cells [25–26]. Erlich
et al. reported that the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BGT226
(Novartis) and BEZ235, in combination with the HDAC
inhibitor panobinostat, inhibit the viability of head
and neck squamous carcinoma cells better than single
drug [27]. The works of Kathleen et al. illustrated that
HDAC inhibitor TSA and the mTOR inhibitor MLN0128
synergistically inhibited the proliferation and induce
apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines [28]. In the present
study, we found that BEZ235 and TSA, if administered
alone, exert antitumour activity against breast cancer
cells in vitro. These findings are consistent with previous
reports that have documented the preclinical single agent
activity of BEZ235 or TSA against lung cancer and PDAC
cells [23, 29–30]. More importantly, for the first time, we
reported that co-treatment with BEZ235 and TSA could
selectively synergistically affect the viability of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D cell lines compared with
other breast cancer subtypes, suggesting that different
breast cancer cell lines have varied sensitivities to the
combination treatment. Additionally, the dual drug
treatment is superior to single-treatment in vivo, which is
consistent with the results of the in vivo experiments.
In some breast cancers, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway is overactive irrelevant to HER2 and ER/PR
status. Akt, a serine/threonine-speciﬁc protein kinase,
stimulates mTOR, resulting in protein synthesis increasing
via its effectors 4EBP1 and S6K [31–32], promoting
polysome formation and translation of transcription factors
modulating tumour cell growth. Akt also phosphorylates
BAD, BIM and caspase, which leads to inhibition of
apoptosis [33]. Thus, Akt is known as a key point bonding
cell growth, cellular metabolism and cell apoptosis. In
this study, we found that co-treatment with BEZ235 and
TSA caused a marked reduction in p-Akt (Ser473) levels,
abolishing the feedback activation of PI3K-Akt due to
p-mTOR (Ser2448) inhibition, in addition to maintaining
marked attenuation of p-S6 (Ser240/244) and p-4EBP1
(Ser65) levels caused by depletion of p-mTOR (Ser2448)
activity. Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 appears to be a key
regulator of the proliferation and survival of breast cancer
cells. Consequently, a marked depletion of p-4EBP1
(Ser65) levels upon combined treatment with BEZ235
and TSA would inhibit the growth and survival of breast
cancer cells. Therefore, the synergistic effect on breast

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer cells is connected with further inhibition of the
PI3K/mTOR signalling pathway.
For most drugs inducing cancer cell death, cell
apoptosis is a common mechanism. Venkannagari et al.
reported that BEZ235 and Panobinostat (HDAC inhibitor)
can synergistically suppress pancreatic cancers through the
TORC1/4EBP1 signalling pathway and induce apoptosis
[34]. Here, using a FACS assay and Hoechst 33342
staining, we found that co-treatment with BEZ235 and
TSA could synergistically induce apoptosis compared
with either BEZ or TSA alone. It is well known that
apoptosis is regulated by various signalling pathways,
including the death ligand pathway and the mitochondrial
pathway. In the process of the mitochondrial pathway, Bcl2, the anti-apoptotic protein and Bax, the pro-apoptotic
protein were actived, which activate caspase-3 and
caspase-9 and accelerate the secretion of cytochrome c
in the downstream [35–36]. Once activated, caspase-3
cleaves PARP-1 into two fragments, promoting DNA
fragmentation and triggering apoptosis, indicating that
an impaired DNA repair mechanism is associated with
the induction of apoptosis [37–38]. In another signal
pathway of apoptosis, the death receptor pathway leads
to the activation of a caspase cascade involving caspase-8
and caspase-3. As initiator caspase, caspase-8 produce a
cascade reaction in response to extracellular signals from
apoptosis-inducing ligands [39]. In this study, our results
showed that co-treatment of BEZ235 and TSA resulted in
greatly reduced Blc-2 protein expression in breast cancer
cells, whereas Bax protein increased, in agreement with
previous reports, which suggests that the ratio of Bcl-2/
Bax is significant in the survival of drug-induced apoptosis
in cancer cells, rather than Bcl-2 alone [40–42]. Moreover,
cleaved caspase-3, 8, and 9 proteins were all significantly
increased, indicating that the caspase-dependent pathway
was involved in the BEZ235 and TSA co-treatment. The
mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway
maybe the mechanisms that the combination treatment
inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in breast cancer
cells.
Recent studies demonstrated the association
between autophagy and cancer. Concurrent induction
of apoptosis and autophagy in some cancer cells was
reported for several anticancer compounds, such as
cannabidiol in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, which
provides a mechanism that cancer cells may survive
stresses imposed by therapy [43]. So far over 35 proteins
are considered to be essential in autophagy occurrence
and progression containing Beclin1 and LC3B [44]. The
conversion of LC3B to LC3B-II, the lower migrating form
in autophagosomes have been considered as indicator of
autophagy [45]. Chen et al revealed that there were 9
cell lines that had allelic Beclin-1 deletions among 22
breast cancer cell lines by a FISH analysis [46]. High
frequency of monoallelic BECN1 gene deletion has been

found in up to 75% cases of human ovarian, breast and
prostate tumours. Thus, Beclin-1 is considered a tumour
suppressor gene. The novel finding in this study is that
co-treatment with BEZ235 and TSA potently induces
autophagy in breast cancer cells while inhibiting cell
growth and initiating apoptosis, evidenced by the
detection of increased protein levels of LC3B-II and
Beclin1 and punctate staining of FITC-LC3B bound in
autophagosomes. These results suggest that co-treatment
with BEZ235 and TSA may lead to the engagement of
autophagic cell death and tumour cell growth inhibition.
There is a close relationship between apoptosis
and autophagy during cell death. The intricate interaction
between these mechanisms is a substantial challenge
in cancer therapy. Under some conditions, autophagy
and apoptosis can exert synergetic effects, while in
other situations, autophagy can be initiated only if
apoptosis is repressed [47]. 3-MA, an inhibitor of the
autophagy, has been uncovered to block the formation
of preautophagosome, autophagosome, and autophagic
vacuoles [48]. As expected, we found that 3-MA
diminished the increase in the autophagic protein LC3BII, induced by the combination group, which is consistent
with previous reports. Additionally, we found that the
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP-1 were also improved in
varying degrees by 3-MA in breast cancer cells treated by
the BEZ235 and TSA combination group, indicating that
dual drug treatment may trigger apoptosis and autophagy,
leading to cell death of breast cancer cells via a caspasedependent pathway.
In summary, our findings demonstrate that the
simultaneous suppression of the combination of the PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 and the pan-HDAC inhibitor
TSA is more effective than single agent in inhibiting
the viability of breast cancer cells in vitro and tumour
progression in vivo. This combination is also effective in
inducing apoptosis and enhancing autophagy in tumour
regression of these breast cancer cells, which could be a
new selective strategy for breast cancer patients.

Cell viability was measured using the MTT
[3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium]
dye reduction method. Cells in DMEM or PRMI1640
medium with 10% FBS were plated into 96-well plates
(2×103 cells/100μL/well) and cultured with indicated
compounds for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h. The absorbance value
(OD) of the wells was measured with a microplate reader
at test and reference wavelengths of 570 nm. Percent
growth was reported relative to untreated controls. Each
experiment contained at least triplicate samples and was
performed at least three times. The combination index
(CI) for each drug combination was obtained using the
commercially available software Calcusyn (Biosoft,
Ferguson, MO). CI<1, CI=1, and CI>1 represent
synergistic, additive or antagonistic interaction of the two
agents, respectively.

Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested by 0.25% trypsin, then
collected by centrifugation at 1000×g for 5 min at
RT. After prepared cell solution at a concentration of
1× 106 cells/mL, cells were mixed in Binding buffer,
and incubated with 5uL of Annexin V-FITC and 5uL
Propidium iodide (PI) (1:100, FITC Annexin V Apoptosis
Detection kit II, BD Bioscience, USA) for 20 min in
darkness. Fluorescence was measured by FACS caliber
cytometer (BD Company, USA) using standard software.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

Colony formation assay

Human breast cancer cells MCF-7, T47D, MDAMB-231, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR3
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cell lines were cultured in
DMEM and PRMI1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
at 37°, 5% CO2. When the cells were spread the bottle
bottom of 80%, transferred of culture by 0.25% trypsin
digestion every 2~3 days. Cells were thawed and cultured
for 3~5 passages, then frozen in aliquots in -80° and/or
liquid nitrogen until use.

Prepared the concentration of 100 cells/mL cells
and plated 1 mL of cell solution to 6 cm dish to expect
plating 100 cell in each dish. After adding the drug to the
medium at indicated concentration for 48 h, medium was
replaced and colonies allowed to form until clearly visible,
usually an additional 14 days. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 1 h at RT, then stained with Giemsa.
The cloning efficiency was calculated by dividing the
number of wells containing proliferating cells with the
total number of cell-plated wells.

Cells were grown on cover slips to 60~70% of
cell confluence, then fixed by methanol for 30 min and
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After
washing in PBS, the fixed cells was incubated in 3%
albumin bovine serum (BSA) for 1 h at RT. Cells were
incubated with primary antibody (1:50) for 1 h and the
secondary antibody (against Alexa Fluor®488 goat antirabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor®568 goat anti-mouse IgG,
1:1000) for 30 min at RT. Staining cells with 0.1~1 mg/
mL 49-6-diainidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min,
cells were observed with Leica confocal microscope TCS
SP5 II.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 17.0
software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data
from experiments were expressed as means±standard
deviation (SD), and evaluated by analysis on factorial
design of two factors and one-way ANOVA. Differences
were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.

GRANT SUPPORT

Whole cells lysate were prepared and electrophoretic
sepearated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrilamide
(SDS-PAGE) gel. Then polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membrane electrotransferred was incubated with 5% skim
milk solution for 1 h at RT, and overnight at 4°C with
primary antibodies (1:1000 ~ 1:5000). After washing the
membrane for three times with PBS-T, PVDF membrane
was shaked with secondary antibody at RT for 1 h. Then
protein-antibody complexes were detected by enzymelinked chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (ECL, Pierce
Biotechnology). Results were analyzed quantitatively
using Chemiluminescent and Fluorescent Imaging System
(Sage, champchemi professional, China).

Animal experiments were approved by the animal
ethics committee of the Yanbian university, China and
performed in accordance with the regulations of the
Service of Consumables and Veterinary Affairs-Division
of Animal Protection (SCAV-EXPANIM). Female
nude mice aged 4~6 weeks were obtained from Beijing
Vital River Laboratories (VRL), China, and housed in
pathogen-free conditions and maintained at 25±1° under
a natural light-dark cycle in a well-ventilated room. 5×106
MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the mammary fat
pad of nude mice. When tumor reached to 200 mm3, mice
were randomized into four groups (n=5, in each group):
DMSO, BEZ235(30mg/kg/d, p.o.), TSA(1.5mg/kg/d, i.p.),
and BEZ235+TSA groups. Animals were sacrificed after
35 days of treatment, and remove the tumor in formalin,
