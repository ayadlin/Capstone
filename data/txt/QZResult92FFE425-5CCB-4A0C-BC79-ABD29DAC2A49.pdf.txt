and Endometrial Cancer Cells

Abstract
Omental adipose stromal cells (O-ASC) are a multipotent
population of mesenchymal stem cells contained in the omentum tissue that promote endometrial and ovarian tumor proliferation, migration, and drug resistance. The mechanistic
underpinnings of O-ASCs' role in tumor progression and growth
are unclear. Here, we propose a novel nitric oxide (NO)–mediated metabolic coupling between O-ASCs and gynecologic
cancer cells in which O-ASCs support NO homeostasis in
malignant cells. NO is synthesized endogenously by the conversion of L-arginine into citrulline through nitric oxide synthase
(NOS). Through arginine depletion in the media using L-arginase and NOS inhibition in cancer cells using NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), we demonstrate that patientderived O-ASCs increase NO levels in ovarian and endometrial
cancer cells and promote proliferation in these cells. O-ASCs

and cancer cell cocultures revealed that cancer cells use O-ASC–
secreted arginine and in turn secrete citrulline in the microenvironment. Interestingly, citrulline increased adipogenesis
potential of the O-ASCs. Furthermore, we found that O-ASCs
increased NO synthesis in cancer cells, leading to decrease in
mitochondrial respiration in these cells. Our ﬁndings suggest
that O-ASCs upregulate glycolysis and reduce oxidative stress
in cancer cells by increasing NO levels through paracrine
metabolite secretion. Signiﬁcantly, we found that O-ASC–
mediated chemoresistance in cancer cells can be deregulated
by altering NO homeostasis. A combined approach of targeting secreted arginine through L-arginase, along with targeting
microenvironment-secreted factors using L-NAME, may be a
viable therapeutic approach for targeting ovarian and endometrial cancers. Cancer Res; 75(2); 456–71. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

regulate tumor growth and induce chemoresistance is unknown.
We hypothesize that "nitric oxide homeostasis" is a key player in
regulating reciprocal communication between O-ASCs and gynecologic cancers (ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer).
O-ASCs can differentiate into adipocytes lineage, promote
tumor initiation, growth, vascularization, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy in many tumor models (2, 10). Recently,
we showed that O-ASCs promoted proliferation, migration, chemotherapy, and radiation response of ovarian cancer cells (8).
Omentum has been shown to promote colonization of ovarian
cancer cells (11). Mounting evidence suggests that bidirectional
communication between ovarian cancer and its microenvironment is critical for tumor growth (12). One critically important,
yet often overlooked, contributor to ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer tumor growth, progression, and metastasis to
omentum is nitric oxide (NO). Cancer cells' high afﬁnity for
NO could explain the proximity of many carcinomas to fatty
tissue, and thus the high positive correlation between obesity and
cancer (13).
NO is an intracellular signaling molecule that plays pleiotropic
roles in cellular physiology and diseases (14) by regulating
cellular levels of pH, blood ﬂow, oxygen, and nutrients (15). NO
is synthesized endogenously by the conversion of L-arginine into
citrulline through nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NOS is differentially expressed in obese and nonobese individuals and is overexpressed in many tumors (16, 17). It has been shown that high
levels of NOS activity exist in malignant tissue from gynecologic
cancers (18) and higher NOS expressions were correlated to the

The omentum, the fatty pad of adipose tissue that covers the
bowel, is a frequent site of metastasis for ovarian cancer (1–3). The
omentum contains a population of stromal cells, adipose stromal
cells (ASC), which are multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that
engraft in tumors and can support cancer progression (4–7).
Omentum-derived ASCs (O-ASC) may contribute to the formation of a hospitable environment for the development of ovarian
cancer metastasis (8, 9). Recently, we showed that O-ASCs promoted proliferation, migration, chemotherapy, and radiation
response of ovarian cancer cells (8). Furthermore, O-ASCs
recruited to tumors expressed factors that enhanced tumor vascularization, promoted survival, and proliferation of endometrial
cancer cells (9). However, the mechanism by which O-ASCs

more advanced stages of breast cancers (19). NO acts in a bimodal
manner in cancer research, at low concentrations it increases
proliferation, angiogenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and cytoprotection (10, 20, 21). However, high concentrations of NO induce
extensive DNA damage, oxidative, and nitrosative stress that lead
to cytotoxicity and apoptosis of tumor cells (22, 23). The impact
of altering NO metabolism in the tumor microenvironment is
unknown.
Altered cancer cells' metabolism is one of the tumor hallmarks
(24). Warburg reported that cancer cells rely on glycolysis for their
energetic needs even under aerobic conditions. Despite glycolysis
being an inefﬁcient mechanism for ATP production compared
with mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, cancer cells
were found to be metabolically reprogrammed for increased
glucose uptake and they route the intermediate metabolite pyruvate toward lactate secretion. Treating cancer as an isolated
epithelial cell disease has not been successful because of the
unique interplay between the various aspects of the tumor and
microenvironment (25). Thus, the microenvironment has been
the recent target of molecular strategies for tumor treatment (12).
Little is known about the features of metabolic alterations
induced by O-ASCs in cancer cells. We hypothesize that O-ASCs
regulate NO metabolism in ovarian cancer and endometrial
cancer cells, thereby support tumor growth, survival, and chemoresistance. We propose a previously unexplored metabolic
coupling among ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer cells, and
O-ASCs by showing that O-ASCs affect cancer hallmarks by
altering the NO homeostasis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
patient-derived O-ASCs regulate NO homeostasis in ovarian
cancer and endometrial cancer cells and promote tumor growth
and induce chemoresistance in these cancer cells. Collectively, our
study will lead to signiﬁcant advances in the understanding of the
omentum in altering cancer metabolism and lead to novel therapeutics, enabling treatment disrupting the communication
between the tumor and omentum.

Materials and Methods
Isolation of patient-derived O-ASC
Grossly normal-appearing human omentum was obtained
according to Institutional Review Board–approved protocols.
O-ASCs were isolated as described in previously published protocol (8). Informed consent for tissue banking was obtained from
each patient. All clinical investigations were conducted according
to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written
consent was obtained from each patient. O-ASCs were classiﬁed as
lean (BMI25) and overweight (BMI>25). ASCs were isolated
according to published protocols (24). After isolation, cells were
expanded in vitro, and then characterized with ﬂow cytometry to
evaluate cell-surface marker expression. O-ASCs were characterized with antibodies against the following markers: CD34, CD44,
CD45, CD29, CD90, EpCam (from Becton Dickinson), and
CD105 (from BioLegend).
Cells and reagents
The human ovarian and endometrial carcinoma cell lines,
OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A, were grown in RPMI-1640 containing
10% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin and streptomycin
mixture. O-ASCs were maintained in MEM-a containing 20%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. All cells
were kept at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2.
NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and SNAP were pur-

chased from Enzo Life Sciences. L-arginase from bovine was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Direct and indirect coculture
For indirect cocultures, transwell plates (Corning) with two
compartments separated by a polycarbonate membrane with 0.4mm pores were used. O-ASCs were seeded in the upper compartment (0.2  105 cells/well) and cancer cells in the lower compartment (1  105 cells/well). O-ASCs and cancer cells could not
contact each other directly although they can communicate
through the soluble factors derived from each cell type such as
metabolites and growth factors. The cells were cocultured for 2 to
5 days, depending on experiments. Cancer cells and O-ASCs alone
were cultured as controls.
For direct coculture, O-ASCs were seeded in 96-well microplates and incubated at 37 C until they attached to surface. Next,
cancer cells were seeded on top of attached O-ASCS. The ratio of
O-ASCs to cancer cells was 3:1.
Quantitative analysis of NO
Cancer cells either experienced transwell coculture of O-ASCs
or they were monocultured for 72 hours. The media were replaced
with fresh media (RPMI-1640) 3 hours before sample collection.
For measurement of NO content in homogenates, cells were
washed in PBS solution at 4 C and lysed in PBS solution containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmol/L N-ethylmaleimide, 0.2 mmol/L
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride, and protease inhibitors. After three instant freeze–thaw cycles (80/37 C), lysates
were passed through a 29-gauge needle to reduce viscosity and
spun at 2,000  g for 10 minutes at 4 C. Protein concentration
was measured to normalize the NO results. Samples were assessed
by using a Sievers NO analyzer (280i; GE Analytical Instruments).
Cell viability analysis
OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A were cocultured either directly or
indirectly with O-ASCs at 37 C for 2 to 5 days, depending on the
experiment. For indirect coculture, cancer cells were trypsinized
and stained with Trypan Blue. Viable cancer cells were quantiﬁed
by hemocytometer counting. For direct coculture experiments,
OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A cells stably transfected with ﬁreﬂy
luciferase gene using a lentiviral method were used. Cancer cells'
viability and proliferation was determined by measuring luminescence by a plate reader (SpectraMax M5; Molecular Devices).
UPLC
Cell supernatants were collected after 24 hours of incubation
with fresh media and were stored at 80 C until further analysis.
Extracellular metabolite proﬁling was performed using a Waters
ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. Derivatization of samples was according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, deproteinized samples are prepared by
mixing 1:1 ratio of collected media with 10% sulfosalicylic acid/
norvaline solution. The mixture is centrifuged for no more than 5
minutes at a ﬁxed angle at 13,000 rpm. Supernatant from the
centrifugation is then added to borate buffer/NaOH mixture
along with reconstituted MassTrak AAA regent. Chromatographic
separations were performed on a 2.1 mm  150 mm chromatography column. The column was maintained at 43 C, eluted
with a mix of 99.9% of MassTrak AAA eluent A concentrate (8%–
10% acetonitrile, 4%–6% formic acid, 84%–88% ammonium
acetate/water solution), and diluted at 10% in miliQ water and
0.1% of MassTrak AAA eluent B (95% acetonitrile, 5% acetic

acid) with a MassTrak AAA eluent B (95% acetonitrile, 5%
acetic acid derivatized sample was injected into the column with
UV detection at 260 nm.
Adipogenesis
O-ASCs were cultured in a 12-well plate in MEM-a media until
cells were almost conﬂuent. The media were replaced with quick
differentiation media that includes DMEM/F12, human transferrin (10 mg/mL), insulin (0.02 mmol/L), cortisol (0.1 mmol/L),
rosiglitazone (1 mmol/L), dexamethasone (1 mmol/L), IBMX (500
mmol/L), and indomethacine (200 mmol/L; all were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich). After 4 days, the media were changed to
adipogenic media including insulin (0.02 mmol/L) and rosiglitazone (1 mmol/L). Differentiation of O-ASCs was determined
by either OilRed O staining or measuring glycerol 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity.
OilRed O staining
The cells incubated in adipogenic media for 7 or 14 days
(depending on the experiment) were rinsed twice with warm
PBS. The cells were ﬁxed with 5 vol% glutaraldehyde solution in
PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. The oil red O solution
was prepared by mixing an oil red O (0.3 wt%) stock solution in
isopropanol (6 mL) and 4-mL distilled water followed by the
ﬁltration through Whatman ﬁlter (No. 1). Fixed cells were incubated with oil red O for 10 minutes at room temperature. The cells
were rinsed with tap water to be viewed by phase-contrast microscopy (EVOS XL Core Cell Imaging System).
G3PDH activity
O-ASCs were grown and induced to differentiate in 12-well
plate as describe above. The G3PDH activity was measured using
the method by Sottile and Seuwen (26). Brieﬂy, the media were
removed and the cells were washed once with PBS. An ice-cold
homogenization solution was then added (20 mmol/L Tris, 1
mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, and pH adjusted to
7.3). Cell lysate was stored at 20 C until measurement. To
prepare the enzyme reaction, 80 mL of reaction mix (0.1 mol/L
triethanolamine, 2.5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, 334 mmol/L NADH, and pH adjusted to 7.7) and
10 mL of cell lysate were added to each well, and plates were
preincubated for 10 minutes at 37 C. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) was added to start the reaction (10 mL/well of a 4
mmol/L stock solution in H2O). Absorbance (340 nmol/L) was
monitored at time intervals by a plate reader (SpectraMax M5;
Molecular Devices). The protein content of cell cultures was
determined in parallel wells. Results are expressed as mU/mg

protein (1 U ¼ 1 mmol NADH/min). For control experiments,
G3PDH from human was used (Abcam).
XF bioenergetics assay
Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured with an
XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Cancer
cells were reseeded upon termination of indirect coculture with
O-ASCs in Seahorse 24-well microplates at a cell density of 0.5
 105 cells per well. The plate is incubated at 37 C with 5%
CO2 until cells were attached to surface. The attached cells were
washed with 200 mL of assay media (FBS excluded RPMI)
and were incubated at 37 C without CO2 for 1 hour for
equilibrium. The endogenous respiration or basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was then measured. The endogenous
coupling degree of the OXPHOS system was assessed using
oligomycin (2 mg/mL), an inhibitor of the F1F0-ATPsynthase.
The uncoupled OCR was also measured in the presence of
1 mmol/L of FCCP. Finally, the cells were treated with a
mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, rotenone (2.5 mmol/L), to
assess the mitochondrial contribution to OCR.
Metabolic assays
The lactate secretion was quantiﬁed with the lactate kit (Trinity
Biotech). The lactate secreted into the growth media by the cells
after 24 hours of incubation was measured according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance at 540 nm was
proportional to the lactate concentration in the sample. The
results were expressed in mmol/million cells. By a similar method,
the glucose consumption was determined with the Glucose Autokit (Wako).
The pyruvate uptake was estimated spectrophotometrically by
measuring the remaining pyruvate in growth media after 24 hours
of incubation of the cells in different experimental conditions as
speciﬁed in the text. The aim of this assay was to determine the
amount of NADH oxidized at 340 nm in a 96-well plate format.
Each well contained 20 mL of sample, NADH reagent, and lactate
dehydrogenase reconstituted at 50% in glycerol and diluted to
1:20 in Tris (0.1 mol/L; pH 7).
ATP measurements
The intracellular ATP content was measured using the CellTiterGlo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The cells were
seeded in 96-well plates upon termination of transwell coculture
at 0.5  105 cells per well and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2
until cells are attached to surface. Next, cells were incubated for 3
hours in the absence or the presence of oligomycin (2 mg/mL) and
2-deoxyglucose (100 mmol/L) at 37 C. The ATP content was

thereby measured according to the manufacturer's instructions,
with a spectrophotometer SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices).
Detection of intracellular reactive oxygen species
The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined using the ROS-speciﬁc ﬂuorescent dye H2DCF-DA. Brieﬂy,
cancer cells and O-ASCs were transwell cocultured for 3 days.
Cancer cells were trypsinized and re-plated in 96-well plates until
cells were attached to surface. Next, cells were washed with PBS
and incubated with 10 mmol/L H2DCF-DA for 20 minutes at
37 C. The probe was washed by PBS and the DCF ﬂuorescence (Ex
485 nm and Em 535 nm) was measured by a plate reader
(SpectraMax M5; Molecular Devices).
NADPH measurement
A water-soluble tetrazolium salt was used to monitor the
amount of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) in cancer cells through its reduction to a yellow
colored water-soluble formazan dye. Brieﬂy, cells were washed
with PBS and 100 mL of XTT/1-methoxyPMS solution (251 and
0.5 mmol/L, respectively) was added in each well. Formazan
formation was quantiﬁed by measuring absorbance at 650 nm
using a plate reader (SpectraMax M5; Molecular Devices).
Analysis of gene expression using real-time PCR
Cells from transwell coculture and monoculture were used.
Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA
was synthesized from 1.0 mg of total RNA with the High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) using a
Veriti 96-well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA
levels of gene of interest were examined by real-time PCR using
50 ng of the resultant cDNA. Real-time PCR was performed with
the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using the
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The
reactions with gene of interest were normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Speciﬁc primer
sets were as follows listed 50 –30 ; forward and reverse, respectively):
iNOS, AGATAAGTGACATAAGTGACC and CATTCTGCTGCTTGCTGAG; AP2, GCATGGCCAAACCTAACATGA and CCTGGCCCAGTATGAAGGAAA; and LPL, CTGGACGGTAACAGGAATGTATGAG and CATCAGGAGAAAGACGACTCGG. Reactions were
performed in a volume of 20 mL.
Data analysis
Results are expressed as mean  SEM of at least triplicates.
Statistical analyses were performed for multiple comparisons with

one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc tests and Bonferroni. The
Student t test was implemented for two comparison analyses.
Differences were considered statically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05 ( , P <
0.05; x, P < 0.01; and #, P < 0.001).

Results
O-ASCs induce NO synthesis in ovarian cancers and
endometrial cancers
We hypothesized that "NO homeostasis" is a key player in
regulating reciprocal communication between O-ASCs and
cancer cells. We tested NO levels in coculture media supernatants of O-ASCs and ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 1A) as compared with tumor cells cultured alone. Signiﬁcantly higher NO
was detected in cocultures. To further conﬁrm the increased NO
levels in cancer cells, we measured NO in cancer cell homogenates. Indeed, NO levels were higher in cell homogenates of
cancer cells that were in cocultures compared with cancer cells
cultured alone (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, control cell line (IMR90, human ﬁbroblasts) was unable to increase NO synthesis in
cocultures (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that O-ASCs selectively increase NO synthesis in cancer cells. Furthermore, OASCs increased expression of iNOS in HEC-1-A cells in Transwell cocultures (Fig. 1C). Cancer cells in turn increased NO
synthesis in O-ASCs; O-ASCs synthesized higher NO when
transwell cocultured with ovarian cancer and endometrial
cancer cells (Fig. 1D).
To conﬁrm that NO synthesis in these cells is by conversion of
arginine into citrulline through NOS, we measured NO levels in
the presence of NOS inhibitor L-NAME (Fig. 1E). As seen in Fig. 1E,
L-NAME reduced the NO production in a dose-dependent manner
in cancer cells. The hydrolysis of L-NAME results in L-NNA, a fully
functional inhibitor of NOS. L-NAME action on NOS was further
conﬁrmed using L-NNA, an active form of the NOS inhibitor.
Furthermore, D-NAME, an inactive enantiomer of L-NAME that
served as negative control, was ineffective in reducing the NO
production in cancer cells. To ascertain whether arginine is a
major source for NO synthesis in these cells, we measured NO
synthesis under arginine depletion conditions with and without LNAME. As see in Fig. 1F, under arginine-deprived conditions, NO
synthesis is drastically reduced, thus indicating that other nutrients contribution toward NO synthesis is negligible. Moreover,
when L-NAME is added to inhibit NO production through endogenously synthesized arginine, the decrease of NO levels was not
signiﬁcant. To conﬁrm whether arginine levels in cancer cells were
regulated through arginase, an enzyme that converts arginine into
ornithine and urea, we measured urea secretion in these cells. Our

O-ASCs positively regulate ovarian cancers and endometrial cancer growth through arginine. A, O-ASCs and stably luciferase transfected ovarian cancer and
endometrial cancer cells were in contact cocultures in 96-well plate. Luciferin (150 mg/mL) was added and luminescence was assessed to quantify viable
cells for 5 days. The media were changed to RPMI after each measurement for further viability assessment. B, OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A cells were seeded in 6-well
plates, while O-ASCs were seeded on top of transwell inserts. The media were changed to RPMI without arginine during 3 days of indirect coculture. Cancer cells'
viability was measured and was reported in million units. Cancer cells without cocultures are shown in white (medium with arginine) and black (medium
without arginine) bars. Cocultured cancer cells (both OVCAR42 and HEC-1-A) are labeled according to the O-ASCs they were cocultured. Cancer cells without
coculture and without arginine were used as the control. C, cancer cells were cocultured in direct contact either with O-ASCs or IMR-90 for 3 days before
their viability was measured. The coculture media were complete RPMI or RPMI without arginine. Cancer cells without coculture were used as the control.
D, arginine contents of cancer cells and O-ASCs in mono and coculture, respectively. OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A were transwell cocultured with O-ASCs for

E, O-ASCs from transwell coculture were separated and incubated with arginine-free media for 24 hours before the sample collection. Arginine contents of

results show that cancer cells have negligible arginase activity as
measured through urea secreted in the medium (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Furthermore, gene expression analysis using the Oncomine database (27) showed that arginase-1 (ARG1) expression in
ovarian and endometrial cancers was similar to normal ovarian
epithelium (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The urea secretion data
were in line with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data that did
not show any upregulation of arginase gene expression (ARG1) in
cancer cells.
We next sought to determine whether NO regulates cancer
proliferation. We used S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine
(SNAP), a NO donor, with varying concentrations to investigate
NO's effect on cancer cell growth under complete media conditions. Our results illustrate that SNAP plays a bimodal role in the
growth of ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers. At low concentrations of SNAP (less than 0.1 mmol/L), increased growth of
cancer cells (Fig. 1G), whereas higher concentrations of SNAP
(greater than 1 mmol/L) have cytotoxic effects. To conﬁrm NO's
role in increasing proliferation, we used low to high concentrations of L-NAME. As seen in Fig. 1H, L-NAME and L-NNA had
similar behavior at low concentrations (<1 mmol/L) where they
marginally reduced viability. On the contrary, both L-NNA and LNAME signiﬁcantly reduced viability at 10 mmol/L concentration
compared with D-NAME control.
O-ASCs positively regulate ovarian cancer and endometrial
cancer cells growth through arginine
To understand O-ASCs' role in regulating cancer cells growth,
we ﬁrst cultured ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers cells
with and without O-ASCs cocultures for 5 days (Fig. 2A). OASCs increased the proliferation of both endometrial (HEC-1A) and ovarian (OVCAR429) cancer cell lines. Next, to elucidate
a precise role for the NO pathway in O-ASC–induced tumor
pathogenesis, we cocultured ovarian cancer and endometrial
cancer cells under complete media and arginine-deprived conditions (Fig. 2B). Cells cultured under arginine-deprived conditions will have reduced NO synthesis. We found that ovarian
cancer and endometrial cancer cells are arginine-dependent and
hence had reduced proliferation. Signiﬁcantly, transwell cocultures of both overweight and lean O-ASCs with HEC-1-A and
OVCAR429 cells rescued the proliferation rate in these cells
under arginine-deprivation conditions. Interestingly, the rescue
of proliferation was higher when cancer cells were cocultured
with overweight O-ASCs compared with their lean counterparts. Similar results were obtained when cancer cells were
cultured in conditioned media obtained from lean and overweight O-ASCs (Supplementary Fig. S2A). As seen in the ﬁgure,
the rescue effect with conditioned media for both lean and
overweight O-ASCs is less pronounced compared with rescue of
proliferation obtained with transwell cocultures. We further
conﬁrmed the effect of O-ASCs in rescuing proliferation under
arginine-deprivation conditions under direct contact cocultures
(Fig. 2C). Interestingly, control cell line was ineffective in
rescuing the reduced proliferation in cancer cells under arginine-deprivation conditions. In line with these ﬁndings, IMR90 was found to be arginine-dependent for proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). This is in contrast to complete media
conditions where IMR-90 cells did increase proliferation of
cancer cells.
To establish whether the O-ASC–mediated rescue under arginine deprivation is through the secreted arginine, we measured

462 Cancer Res; 75(2) January 15, 2015

arginine using UPLC in spent media of transwell cocultures of OASCs and cancer cells under arginine-deprivation conditions (Fig.
2D). As seen in the ﬁgure, both lean and overweight O-ASCs had
signiﬁcant arginine secretion in coculture with both ovarian and
endometrial cancer cells, while tumor cells alone did not secrete
arginine. Interestingly, cancer cells exhibited reciprocal effect by
increasing arginine synthesis from O-ASCs (Fig. 2E). As seen in the
ﬁgure, arginine secretion from O-ASCs is higher when they were
cocultured with cancer cells.
Inhibition of endogenous NO synthesis abrogates elevated
viability of cancer cells induced by O-ASCs
The above experiments demonstrated that O-ASC coculture
rescued the growth-inhibitory effect of arginine depletion. We
further investigated whether O-ASCs secrete arginine, an essential metabolite for NO synthesis, or they secrete factors that
upregulate NO synthesis in cancer cells. To assess whether OASCs secrete arginine under arginine-deprivation conditions, we
added L-arginase, an enzyme that converts arginine to ornithine
and urea, in direct cocultures of O-ASCs and cancer cells seeded
in a ratio of 3:1. We ﬁrst evaluated the efﬁcacy of arginase in
depleting arginine in the medium (Supplementary Fig. S3). As
seen in the ﬁgure, arginine levels decreased with increasing
arginase concentration. The L-arginase treatment depletes secreted arginine and thereby disrupts the rescue effect of O-ASCs.
Indeed, L-arginase (10 U/mL) disrupted the rescue potential of
O-ASCs, thus suggesting that O-ASCs secreted arginine is the
possible cause behind the rescue potential of O-ASCs (Fig. 3A
and B). We added L-NAME in contact cocultures and monocultures under arginine-deprivation conditions to determine
whether NO signaling is required for the O-ASC effect on cancer
cell proliferation (Fig. 3C and D). Consistent with L-arginase
results, the addition of L-NAME decreased the rescue effect of OASCs on cancer cells' proliferation in cocultures, thereby suggesting that O-ASCs effects on cancer cell proliferation are mediated
by NO signaling. Interestingly, overweight O-ASCs had stronger
rescue effect in cocultures for both ovarian and endometrial
cancer cells. To determine whether the O-ASCs effect on cancer
cell proliferation is mediated by secreted factors, we added LNAME to transwell cocultures (Fig. 3E and F). In agreement with
L-arginase results, L-NAME addition signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation in cocultures. To further demonstrate the direct involvement of the NO pathway in rescue of cancer cells growth, we
added SNAP (100 nmol/L), a NO donor, under arginine-deprivation and NOS-inhibition conditions (using L-NAME; Fig. 3G).
Remarkably, SNAP rescued the reduced proliferation of cancer
cells under both conditions and the rescue effect was similar to
O-ASC–induced rescue of cancer cell growth under L-NAME and
arginine-deprivation conditions.
Citrulline induces adipogenesis of O-ASCs
Cells with high NOS activity convert arginine into citrulline and
release NO. In our previous study, we found that ovarian cancer
cells secreted citrulline, suggesting signiﬁcant levels of NOS activity. Thus, we measured citrulline in spent media from transwell
cocultures. Interestingly, we found high levels of citrulline in
cocultures compared with tumor cells alone (Fig. 4A). These
results suggest that cancer cells use arginine from the tumor
microenvironment and in turn secrete citrulline to alter the tumor
microenvironment. To reveal the reciprocity of cancer cells in
modulating O-ASCs, we hypothesized that cancer cells secrete

Inhibition of NO synthesis abrogates elevated viability of cancer cells induced by O-ASCs. A and B, stably luciferase transfected ovarian cancer and endometrial
cancer cells (OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A) were cocultured in direct contact with O-ASCs for 3 days (seeding ratio of 1:3). L-arginase (10 U/mL) was added to
deplete arginine from media. Luciferin (150 mg/mL) was added to cells and luminescence was assessed to determine viability of cancer cells. Cancer cells without
coculture and without L-arginase treatment were used as a control. C and D, L-NAME (20 mmol/L) was added to inhibit NO synthesis by blocking NOS.
Cancer cells and O-ASCs were cocultured in direct contact for 72 hours with L-NAME. All the conditions were compared with cancer cells without coculture and
without L-NAME treatment. E and F, cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates while O-ASCs were on top of transwell inserts (the ratio was 1:2, respectively).
The media were changed to RPMI without arginine, with and without L-NAME (20 mmol/L), during 3 days of indirect coculture. OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A without
coculture and without L-NAME treatment were used as control. G, SNAP (100 nmol/L) and L-NAME (10 mmol/L) were simultaneously added to cancer cells
for 48 hours, and the results were compared with the viability of cells treated with L-NAME alone. Moreover, arginine was excluded from the cancer media, and the

presence of citrulline and no alterations were observed (data not
shown).
To conﬁrm our hypothesis, we cultured O-ASCs into adipogenic differentiation media with and without citrulline during the
differentiation period. As seen in Fig. 4C, citrulline markedly
increased the adipogenic differentiation in the three tested primary patient-derived O-ASC cell lines. The extent of differentiation was similar in lean (O-ASC1, O-ACS 35) and overweight (OASC 21) O-ASCs. Noticeably, citrulline increased the size of fat
droplets in O-ASCs (Fig. 4C). We further measured the activity of
G3PDH, an enzymatic marker for measuring adipogenesis.
G3PDH activity is elevated during adipogenesis to support the
production of key metabolites such as glycerol. Our results show
increased G3PDH activity with citrulline at day 14 of O-ASC
differentiation (Fig. 4D). We further measured the mRNA expression of adipocyte protein 2 (AP2) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in
O-ASCs when adipogenesis was induced with and without citrulline. As seen in Fig. 4E, citrulline increased the expression of
these adipogenesis markers. To conﬁrm whether the cancer cells
indeed could increase adipogenesis of O-ASCs, we cultured OASCs in conditioned media obtained from cancer cells (Fig. 4F).
As seen in the ﬁgure, conditioned media from cancer cells significantly increased adipogenesis in patient-derived O-ASC cells.
To prove that cancer cells induce adipogenesis via citrulline, we
measured adipogenesis using cancer cells' conditioned media
with and without arginine. Cancer cells cultured under arginine-deprived conditions will have signiﬁcantly reduced citrulline
in the media. Thus, decreased adipogenesis will be consequent of
reduced citrulline in the conditioned media. As seen in Fig. 4G,
G3PDH activity of O-ASCs differentiated with was signiﬁcantly
higher for conditioned media with arginine than the conditioned
media without arginine. These results conﬁrm our hypothesis that
cancer cells increased adipogenesis in O-ASCs and this increase is
mediated through secreted citrulline.
O-ASCs modulate cancer cells' mitochondrial bioenergetics
Recently, cancer cells have been found to have altered metabolism and this metabolic rewiring promotes tumor growth and
increases malignancy. Previous studies have shown that NO
regulates mitochondrial respiration in hepatocytes and cardiomyoctes (28). To elucidate the precise role of O-ASCs in regulating cancer cells' metabolic pathways by altering NO homeostasis, we performed mitochondrial bioenergetic analysis. Our
results show that NO reduced respiration of both ovarian cancer
and endometrial cancer cells. OCR of cancer cells under arginine-

deprived conditions was signiﬁcantly higher than arginine
replete conditions (Fig. 5A). Inhibiting NO synthesis using LNAME under complete media conditions similarly increased
OCR. Furthermore, when SNAP was added OCR drastically
decreased. The addition of L-arginine in arginine-free media also
decreased OCR, because arginine is a substrate for NO synthesis.
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NO
decreases mitochondrial respiration in cancer cells. To determine
the effect of O-ASCs on mitochondrial respiration of cancer cells
through NO, we measured OCR of cancer cells cocultured with
O-ASCs in arginine-deprived condition for 72 hours. We found
that cancer cells that were cocultured with both lean and overweight O-ASCs had signiﬁcantly lower respiration when compared with cancer cells without cocultures (Fig. 5B and C).
Furthermore, cancer cells in cocultures with O-ASCs had lower
maximal respiratory capacity (measured using FCCP, a protonophoric uncoupler; Fig. 5B). We next measured OCR under NO
inhibition conditions. Consistent with previous results, adding LNAME increased OCR (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, cocultures of both
lean and overweight O-ASCs decreased OCR. Thus, from these
data, we can conclude that O-ASCs increase NO synthesis in
cancer cells, resulting in suppression of mitochondrial respiration in these cells.
O-ASCs regulate ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers'
metabolism via NO pathways
To expand our ﬁndings on O-ASCs' regulation of cancer cells'
metabolism, we examined O-ASCs effect on the glycolysis. NO
increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion in cancer cells (Fig.
6A). Both lean and overweight O-ASCs increased glycolysis in
cancer cells under coculture conditions in the absence of arginine.
These results conﬁrm that O-ASCs induced NO-induced changes
consistent with the Warburg effect in these cells. Interestingly,
pyruvate uptake was increased in cancer cells cocultured with OASCs (Supplementary Fig. S4A). To investigate whether there was
reciprocal communication between cancer cells and O-ASCs in
regulating metabolism, we measured metabolic activity of OASCs with and without cocultures of cancer cells. Interestingly, OASCs from cancer cells coculture had higher glucose uptake and
lactate secretion (Supplementary Fig. S4B). However, pyruvate
uptake was reduced in O-ASCs that were cocultured with cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C). In line with results previously
reported, our results suggest that cancer cells transform the microenvironment cells by increasing their glucose metabolism (29).
To further conﬁrm NO's regulation of cancer cells' metabolism in

Figure 4.
Citrulline induces adipogenesis of O-ASCs. A, OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A cells were transwell cocultured in arginine-free media for 3 days. Fresh media were replaced
24 hours before sample collection. Citrulline contents of collected samples were analyzed by UPLC. Cancer cell viability was measured and reported in
million units to normalize the results. Cancer cells without coculture were used as a control. B, O-ASCs were incubated with MEM-a along with citrulline (0.5 mmol/L)
for 48 hours. O-ASCs' supernatant were collected and citrulline content of samples was assessed with UPLC and compared with fresh media at day 0. C, O-ASCs
were seeded on a 12-well plate and cultured until conﬂuency. The media were replaced with adipogenic media containing insulin (10 mg/mL), rosiglitazone
(2 mmol/L), indomethacin (200 mmol/L), cortisol (100 nmol/L), IBMX (500 mmol/L), and human transferrin (10 mg/mL) with or without citrulline (0.5 mmol/L) for 4
days. Next, the media were exchanged to adipogenic media including only rosiglitazone (2 mmol/L) and insulin (10 mg/mL) with or without citrulline (0.5 mmol/L) for
another 10 days. Lipid droplet formation was evaluated with Oil red O staining. The bright ﬁeld images were taken with 4 and 20 magniﬁcations by
EVOS XL Core Cell Imaging System. D, G3PDH activity was measured for adipogenic induction with and without citrulline conditions as described in B. E, AP2 and LPL
mRNA expressions were measured at day 14 of adipogenic induction in the presence or the absence of citrulline (0.5 mmol/L). F, cancer cells were conditioned 24
hours with MEM-a, and the conditioned media were used to induce adipogenesis in O-ASCs. O-ASCs induced by adipogenic media were used as a control.
G, cancer cells were conditioned with either arginine-free or arginine-containing media. Cancer conditioned media without arginine was then replenished
with 0.2 g/L-arginine before adipogenic induction. G3PDH activity was measured at day 14 and results from cancer complete conditioned media were compared with

increased NADPH and reduced ROS in cocultures under argininedeprivation conditions. These results substantiate the role of OASC–secreted factors that modulate NO homeostasis in cancer
cells and thereby upregulate glycolysis and reduce oxidative stress
(30).
O-ASCs induce chemoresistance of cancer cells
The above results show that O-ASCs secrete factors that modulate NO homeostasis and increases cancer cells' proliferation and
alters cancer metabolism. We recently showed that O-ASCs induce
chemoresistance in cancer cells (8). Here, we asked whether this
O-ASC–mediated chemoresistance can be deregulated by disrupting NO homeostasis. We added L-arginase in direct-contact cocultures of O-ASCs and cancer cells. The L-arginase depletes any
secreted arginine by O-ASCs and blocks NO synthesis in cancer
cells. Remarkably, we found that addition of L-arginase to directcontact cocultures increased chemosensitivity of paclitaxel in
cancer cells (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, addition of L-NAME in
direct-contact cocultures also had similar effect and increased
sensitivity of paclitaxel in cancer cells (Fig. 7B). Similar results
were obtained with additional O-ASCs patient samples treated
with L-arginase at 10 U/mL (Fig. 7C). To conﬁrm the involvement
of NO in increasing resistance of cancer cells to paclitaxel, we
added SNAP in cancer cells cultured with either L-arginase or LNAME in the presence and absence of paclitaxel (Supplementary
Fig. S5). We found that SNAP decreased sensitivity of cancer cells
to paclitaxel, thus corroborating our previous results. We further
evaluated whether combinatorial addition of L-NAME and Larginase will have synergistic effect in disrupting the NO-mediated communication between O-ASCs and cancer. Indeed, adding
both L-NAME and L-arginase signiﬁcantly reduced the cell viability
in cancer cells in cocultures with O-ASCs (Fig. 7D). These results
suggest that a combined approach of targeting secreted arginine
through L-arginase, along with targeting microenvironmentsecreted factors induced increased NO synthesis in cancer cells
using L-NAME, may be a viable therapeutic approach for targeting
ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers.

Discussion
Here, our results revealed mechanism behind the interaction
between O-ASCs and cancer cells. We found that O-ASCs promoted the growth of both ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer
cells through NO. Interestingly, O-ASCs secrete arginine under
arginine-deprivation conditions and this secreted arginine was
uptaken by cancer cells, thereby increases NO synthesis and cancer
cells' growth rate. Arginine depletion is currently used as a therapy
for melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (31, 32). We showed
that when O-ASC–secreted arginine is depleted (using L-arginase)
or when O-ASC–secreted factors induced increased NO synthesis
in cancer cells is inhibited (using L-NAME), there is a decline in the
growth rate of both ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer cells. It

was previously reported by our group that ovarian cancer cells
secrete considerable amount of citrulline, thereby indicating high
NOS activity and arginine utilization (33). Here, our data showed
that ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer cells use arginine
produced by O-ASCs and generate citrulline. Remarkably, citrulline secreted by cancer cells increased the adipogenesis of O-ASCs.
Thus, our ﬁndings propose a previously unexplored metabolic
coupling between cancer cells and O-ASCs.
Recent studies proposed metabolic-symbiosis as a reciprocal
coupling between cancer cells and its microenvironment (34). In
these studies, tumor microenvironment cells, mainly cancer associated ﬁbroblasts, were shown to be in catabolic state, thus
generating energy-rich metabolites (such as lactate, glutamine,
fatty acids, and other amino acids) that are then used by cancer
cells' mitochondria for OXPHOS (35). However, our ﬁndings
show that O-ASCs rescue cancer cells loss of growth under
arginine-deprivation conditions, by secreting arginine for cell
growth/biosynthesis but not for energetic needs. Arginine utilization for NO as a signaling molecule dominated other roles of
arginine in cellular functions. As seen in Fig. 3G, growth of cancer
cells decreased signiﬁcantly when arginine was excluded from
media and SNAP compensated this decrease induced by arginine
deprivation. These results emphasize the crucial role of arginine in
NO synthesis.
In contrast with Warburg effect, recent data suggest that cancer
cells have healthy mitochondria; however, they have upregulated
glycolysis (36). Interestingly, our data suggest that O-ASCs promoted glycolysis in cancer cells by elevating NO synthesis, which
has been shown to have inhibitory effects on enzymes involved in
mitochondrial respiration. Previous studies showed that NO
affects glycolysis through s-nitrosylation of hexokinase (37).
Hexokinase converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in the ﬁrst
step of glycolysis and is highly expressed in cancer cells (38). Low
concentrations of NO (below 100 nmol/L) induce hypoxiainducible factor 1-a (HIF1a) expression and mimics low oxygen
conditions (39). HIF1a, a key regulator of hypoxia, switches
energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis
by regulating glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) expression (40).
We here showed that O-ASCs positively regulate the Warburg
effect by modulating the NO homeostasis. O-ASC–secreted arginine increased NO synthesis in cancer cells that reprogrammed
cancer cells by increasing glycolysis and reducing mitochondrial
ATP generation. Treating cancer cells with arginine-depleted
media showed that reducing NO levels reduced glucose and
pyruvate consumption of cells as well as their lactate secretion
levels. Remarkably, O-ASCs interaction with cancer cells compensated the reduced levels of metabolites. Consistent with our
hypothesis, we found that O-ASCs increased glucose uptake and
lactate secretion of cancer cells under arginine-deprivation conditions. O-ASC–modulated ovarian and endometrial cancer cell
metabolism via arginine secretion that when uptaken by cancer

cells increased NO in these cells. Figure 6E summarizes our results
obtained on metabolic coupling between O-ASCs and cancer
cells. On the basis of our results, "NO homeostasis" could be a
key player in regulating reciprocal communication between OASCs and gynecologic cancer cells. The reciprocal communication
was observed between cancer cells and O-ASCs, where cancer cells
were found to increase glucose metabolism and adipogenesis in
O-ASCs.
NO has been known to inﬂuence respiration rates of cancer cells
by targeting mitochondrial complexes, complex I and IV (41,42).
Previous studies carried out primarily in liver cells showed that
NO regulates mitochondrial respiration by targeting terminal
enzyme of electron transport chain, cytochrome c oxidase by
competing with oxygen (43). Inhibition of complex IV is rapid
(milliseconds), reversible, and occurs at low NO concentrations
(nmol/L), whereas inhibition of complex I occurs after a constant
exposure of higher NO concentrations (44, 45). NO's inhibition
of mitochondrial respiration in cancer cells shifts them from
oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Here, we showed that
arginine deprivation decreases NO, thereby increases OCR of
OVCAR429 and HEC-1-A cells (Fig. 5A). O-ASCs decreased OCR
of cancer cells by secreting arginine, a substrate for NO synthesis
under arginine-deprivation conditions. We demonstrated that
NO can shift source of ATP generation in cancer cells cocultured
with O-ASCs by increasing glycolytic ATP production and concomitantly decrease mitochondrial contribution toward ATP production (Fig. 6B).
Recent studies have shown that O-ASCs induce chemoresistance in cancer cells (46). Multiple lines of evidence support the
link between NO and chemoresistance (47–50). Herein, we show
that O-ASCs regulate cancer cells' response to chemo-drugs
through the NO pathway. Inhibition of NO synthesis, sensitized
cancer cells cocultured with O-ASCs to paclitaxel (Fig. 7A–C).
Furthermore, our studies suggest that combinatorial therapy of
depleting arginine using L-arginase, along with inhibiting NO
using L-NAME, could disrupt the communication between OASCs and cancer cells. Our data present mechanistic insights
into O-ASC–mediated metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells
and also reciprocal modulation of O-ASCs adipogenesis by

cancer cells. Future studies are needed to investigate the therapeutic strategies targeting the impact of O-ASC on cancer
initiation and progression. The detailed analysis of altered NO
metabolism of cancer cells in the presence of O-ASCs will shed
light on the molecular pathways regulated by O-ASCs and thus
allow development of targeted therapies linking signaling,
transcriptional changes with metabolic signatures linking obesity with cancer.
