Abstract
Rapamycin and its analogues have significant antiproliferative action against a variety of tumors. However,
sensitivity to rapamycin is reduced by Akt activation that results from the ablative effects of rapamycin on a
p70 S6K–induced negative feedback loop that blunts phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–mediated support for
Akt activity. Thus, sensitivity to rapamycin might be increased by imposing an upstream blockade to the
PI3K/Akt pathway. Here, we investigated this model using the somatostatin analogue octreotide as a tool
to decrease levels of activated Ser473-phosphorylated Akt (pAkt-Ser473) in pituitary tumor cells that express
somatostatin receptors. Octreotide increased levels of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 that were
suppressed by rapamycin, subsequently decreasing levels of pAkt-Ser473 through effects on phosphotyrosine
phosphatase SHP-1. Octreotide potentiated the antiproliferative effects of rapamycin in immortalized pituitary
tumor cells or human nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma cells in primary cell culture, sensitizing tumor cells
even to low rapamycin concentrations. Combined treatment of octreotide and rapamycin triggered G1 cell
cycle arrest, decreasing E2F transcriptional activity and cyclin E levels by increasing levels of p27/Kip1. These
findings show that adjuvant treatment with a somatostatin analogue can sensitize pituitary tumor cells to the
antiproliferative effects of rapamycin. Cancer Res; 70(2); 666–74. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is
frequently overactivated in a variety of tumors either by
mutations or by growth factors (1). It plays a crucial role
in tumor formation and progression by controlling cell
growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis (2, 3).
Growth factor–bound tyrosine kinase receptors with the
help of adaptors, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), recruit the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 and activate
PI3K and, subsequently, PDK1, Akt, and the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR).
Rapamycin is a mTOR inhibitor with potent immunosuppressant and antiproliferative properties. Rapamycin and its
analogues (rapalogs) are effective against solid tumors
presenting with overactivated PI3K/Akt pathway (4, 5). In

contrast, rapalogs displayed modest efficacy in clinical trials
(6). Analysis of breast cancer biopsies derived from patients
treated with RAD001 revealed increased Akt phosphorylation
(7). The mTOR target p70 S6K phosphorylates IRS-1 at serine
residues, leading to its dissociation from tyrosine kinase receptors and inhibition of the PI3K signaling (8–11). Rapamycin and its analogues by inhibiting mTOR decrease p70 S6K
serine phosphorylation and abolish this inhibitory feedback
loop to IRS-1, resulting in the observed increased Akt phosphorylation (7, 12, 13). Therefore, cotreatment with an agent able to
decrease Akt phosphorylation could overcome rapamycininduced Akt phosphorylation upstreams and improve the
antiproliferative action of rapamycin analogue treatment.
Somatostatin receptor type 2 (Sst2) was shown to deactivate the PI3K pathway by inhibiting p85 tyrosine phosphorylation and decreasing Akt phosphorylation (14, 15).
Somatostatin analogues targeting Sst2, such as octreotide
and lanreotide, are frequently used for the treatment of
neuroendocrine tumors (16).
In the present study, addition of the somatostatin analogue octreotide to rapamycin increased serine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels, decreased rapamycin-induced pAkt-Ser473
levels, and enhanced the antiproliferative effect of rapamycin
in immortalized pituitary tumor cells and in human nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) in primary cell culture by
upregulating p27/Kip1.

the American Peptide Co.; phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate,
MG132, and rapamycin were from Sigma. Lithium chloride
and SB415286 were from Calbiochem. Octreotide was dissolved in 0.01 mol/L acetic acid, and rapamycin and
SB415286 were dissolved in DMSO.
Tumors. This study was approved by the Max Planck Institute ethics committee, and informed consent was received
from each patient or from their relatives. Twenty-eight
NFPAs were included. The tumors were removed through
transsphenoidal surgery and diagnosed by clinical, biochemical, radiological, and surgical findings.
Cell culture. Postsurgical specimens were washed with HDB
buffer [15 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mmol NaCl, 5 mmol/L
KCl, 0.7 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 10 mmol/L glucose, 2.5 mg/mL amphotericin B, 105 units/L penicillin/streptomycin] and enzymatically dispersed as previously described (17). D-Valine was used
to suppress the growth of contaminating fibroblasts (17). Cell
viability over 80% was acceptable, as determined by the acridine
orange and ethidium bromide staining. Cells were seeded in
48-well plates (100,000 per well) and left for 48 h.
The immortalized pituitary tumor cell lines GH3 and AtT20 (American Type Culture Collection) were used. Cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 nmol/L
glutamine, 0.5 mg/L partricin, and 105 units/L penicillinstreptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Proliferation studies. [3H]thymidine incorporation ([3H]
TdR) was performed as previously described (18). Cells were
treated with rapamycin, octreotide, and their combination at
the indicated times for each experiment concentrations in the
presence of [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/mL) for 24 h. Cells treated
with the carriers in which octreotide and rapamycin were dissolved were used as control. Cell proliferation was also assessed using the nonradioactive colorimetric WST-1 assay
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as previously described
(19). All treatments were carried out in quadruplicates.
Colony formation. Anchorage-independent colony formation was determined as previously described (19). AtT-20
cells were treated for 24 h, suspended in 0.3% melted agar,
and plated on 0.5% agar. The cultures were incubated for
20 d and stained with MTT to show the presence of viable
cells under all treatments at the end of the experiment.
Flow cytometry. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry
after propidium iodide staining as previously described (20).
Cells were serum deprived for 24 h and treated for 24 h with
octreotide, rapamycin, and their combination. The vehicle in
which the substances were dissolved was used as control.
Analysis was done in FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) using
the CellQuest and ModFit softwares.
RNA extraction and semiquantitative reverse transcriptionPCR. RNA was extracted by the guanidinium isothiocyanate–
phenol method. PCR for β-actin was performed on 1 μg RNA to
exclude genomic DNA contamination. RNA (1 μg) was reverse
transcribed using random hexanucleotides and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed for p27/Kip1 (sense:
5′-agggcagatacgagtggcag-3′, antisense: 5′-ctggacactgctccgctaacc-3′) and β-actin (internal control) under restrictive
conditions as previously described (21). Each RT-PCR was performed in RNA extracted from three independent experiments.

Western blot. AtT-20 cells were treated with 1 nmol/L octreotide, 1 nmol/L rapamycin, and their combination for the
times indicated for each experiment. DMSO was added to the
control (untreated) and single octreotide treatment. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis
buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Samples were separated by PAGE and
blotted using standard procedures (22).
Primary antibodies were against cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, CDK4, and CDK6
(all made in mouse; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.); retinoblastoma (Rb; made in mouse; BD Pharmingen); pRb-Ser780,
p27/Kip1, Akt, and pAkt-Ser473 (all made in rabbit; Cell Signaling); IRS-1 (Upstate); pIRS-1-Ser636/639 (Cell Signaling); and
pAkt-Ser473 (mouse monoclonal; Calbiochem). Anti-mouse
and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated
secondary antibodies were used (Cell Signaling). Each experiment was performed in duplicates.
Coimmunoprecipitation. AtT-20 cells were treated with
octreotide, rapamycin, and their combination for 5 min
and collected in ice-cold lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 50
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
2 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
1% NP40]. Protein (600 μg) was immunoprecipitated with
an antibody against IRS-1 (Upstate) or with a control rabbit
IgG. Protein A–Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)
was used as previously described (15). The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed, and protein bound to Sepharose was eluted and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Western
blot was performed using the HRP-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate), anti-phosphoserine (Zymed), or
anti–IRS-1 antibody (Upstate). Coimmunoprecipitation was
performed in two independent experiments and repeated
using protein G–Sepharose.
Transfection and reporter assays. The SHP-1/C453S
dominant-negative mutant (SHP-1dn; ref. 23) and the constitutively active myristoylated Akt (Myr-Akt; ref. 24) were used.
Cell transfection was performed with SuperFect (Qiagen
GmbH). Cells (3 × 105) were transfected for 3 h with 1 μg
of SHP-1dn plasmid, left in cell growth medium overnight,
and treated with octreotide alone or in combination with rapamycin. Lysates of cells treated for 3 h were analyzed for
pAkt-Ser 473 and pIRS-1-Ser 636/639 by Western blot. Each
transfection experiment was performed in duplicates. To
confirm the SHP-1dn and Myr-Akt incorporation, Western
blot was performed for hemagglutinin (Acris).
The E2F-Luc construct (Mercury pathway profiling system, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) has the E2F-responsive element upstream to the TATA box of the herpes simplex
virus thymidine kinase promoter and the reporter gene luciferase. Cells transfected with E2F-Luc were treated with
octreotide, rapamycin, and their combination for 6 h, and
luciferase activity was measured by a Berthold luminometer. Transfection efficiency was determined using the
Rous sarcoma virus–β-gal construct as described previously
(19). Data are expressed as the ratio of E2F relative luciferase activity (RLA) to β-gal activity. Each experiment was
performed in triplicates.

RNA interference. Double-stranded small interfering RNA
(siRNA) against mouse p27/Kip1 (Cdkn1b) was obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. One scrambled siRNA
(Scramble II; MWG Biotech) was used as a control.
AtT-20 cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L scrambled
siRNA or siRNA against p27/Kip1 using SuperFect for 3 h and
left in cell growth medium overnight to recover. The day after, they were split and distributed for proliferation assays
and for RNA extraction. Cells for RNA extraction were harvested at the same time with the proliferation assay (i.e., 48
h after transfection with the siRNA). Each experiment was
performed twice.
Statistics. All the [3H]TdR results were assessed by oneway ANOVA in combination with Scheffé's test. P < 0.05
was considered as significant.

Results
Octreotide reverses rapamycin-induced increase in Akt
phosphorylation. To identify a cell model to test our hypothesis, the presence of the feedback of rapamycin on Akt phosphorylation was determined in two immortalized pituitary
tumor cell lines: AtT-20 and GH3. Treatment with 1 nmol/L
rapamycin increased pAkt-Ser 473 levels in AtT-20 cells
(Fig. 1A), whereas it had no effect in GH3 cells, confirming
our previous study (20). Based on these results, AtT-20 cells
were used as experimental model of rapamycin-resistant cells.
In these cells, addition of 1 nmol/L octreotide to rapamycin
treatment decreased pAkt-Ser473 levels. This observation
shows that octreotide affects the feedback loop of rapamycin
on Akt phosphorylation.
Octreotide treatment inhibits the action of rapamycin
on IRS-1. The rapamycin-induced increase in pAkt-Ser473
and subsequent resistance to its antiproliferative action were
suggested to arise from the elimination of the negative feedback of the mTOR target p70 S6K on IRS-1 (Supplementary
Fig. S1). In line with this hypothesis, herein, it is shown that
treatment with octreotide increases the levels of IRS-1 detected with the phosphoserine antibody, which had been decreased by rapamycin (Fig. 1B). In contrast, octreotide
suppressed IRS-1 levels detected with the 4G10 phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1B), as was previously shown (14). Furthermore, rapamycin was found to decrease pIRS-1-Ser636/639
levels and addition of octreotide eliminated this effect
(Fig. 1C).
Octreotide was shown to transduce its effects on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation through SHP-1. Transfection with a
catalytically inactive SHP-1 abolished the mediated increase
of octreotide in pIRS-1-Ser636/639 levels (Fig. 2A) and decrease
in pAkt-Ser473 levels (Fig. 2B).
Octreotide treatment did not affect the suppressed p70
S6K of rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S2). Rapamycin also
decreased mTOR phosphorylation at the Ser2448 and Ser2481
sites.
These data show that octreotide increases serine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels and decreases pAkt-Ser473, in a mechanism involving SHP-1, and suggest that it could improve the
antiproliferative action of rapamycin.

Antiproliferative action of the combined octreotiderapamycin treatment in immortalized pituitary tumor
cells. Rapamycin treatment had a small antiproliferative
effect in AtT-20 cells at 1 nmol/L concentration (25% growth
suppression; P < 0.05) and no effect at lower doses (Fig. 3A). In
these cells, addition of 1 nmol/L octreotide to 1 nmol/L rapamycin led to 50% inhibition, as determined by both [3H]TdR
(Supplementary Fig. S3A) and a nonradioactive colorimetric
assay (P < 0.001 versus vehicle control, and P = 0.003 versus
rapamycin alone; Fig. 3B). The antiproliferative effect of the
combined treatment remained even at lower rapamycin concentrations (P < 0.01). Octreotide alone had a mild antiproliferative effect (20% growth suppression; P < 0.01).
To confirm the sensitivity of AtT-20 cells to the combined
treatment, a soft agar colony formation assay was used. A 24hour treatment with the combined octreotide-rapamycin
treatment inhibited anchorage-independent colony formation in AtT-20 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Antiproliferative action of the combined octreotiderapamycin treatment in human pituitary tumors in primary
cell culture. The antiproliferative efficacy of the combined
treatment was tested in human NFPA in primary cell culture.
In NFPA, Akt is overactivated (25) so these tumors could
benefit from rapamycin treatment. Treating NFPA in primary
cell culture with 1 nmol/L rapamycin decreased proliferation
by <20% in 8 of 28 tumors (mean suppression of [3H]TdR incorporation as % of vehicle control: 27 ± 6; Fig. 3C). Addition
of 1 nmol/L octreotide further suppressed proliferation
(% mean suppression: 44 ± 13), and the suppressive effect
of the combined rapamycin-octreotide treatment was significantly higher than that of rapamycin alone (P = 0.009) in
these eight tumors.
However, most of the NFPAs (20 of 28) did not respond to
1 nmol/L rapamycin alone (Fig. 3C), displaying resistance to
this treatment. Combined octreotide-rapamycin treatment in
these tumors significantly reduced proliferation in all cases
(% mean suppression: 38 ± 13; P < 0.001). Altogether, all 28
NFPAs responded to the combined octreotide-rapamycin
treatment, with [3H]TdR inhibition ranging from 20% to 74%.
In six tumors that provided enough cells for dose-response
studies, the suppressive action of the combined octreotiderapamycin treatment (1 nmol/L; % mean suppression: 45 ±
17; P = 0.018) happened after adding concentrations of rapamycin as low as 0.1 nmol/L and 0.01 to 1 nmol/L octreotide
[% mean suppression: 43 ± 22 (P = 0.037) and 42 ± 21 (P =
0.019), respectively; Fig. 3D].
Single octreotide treatment did not suppress proliferation
in most NFPAs, similar to what has been extensively reported
in previous studies. Seven of 28 NFPAs responded to 1 nmol/L
octreotide (% mean suppression: 26 ± 5). Addition of 1 nmol/L
rapamycin to octreotide in these seven cases had a significantly higher antiproliferative effect compared with octreotide alone (% mean suppression: 50 ± 18; P = 0.007;
Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Effect of combined octreotide-rapamycin treatment
on cell cycle components. Both rapamycin and octreotide
are cytostatic (26–28), and the combined treatment accumulated the cells in the G0-G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. S4A).

Octreotide Enhances Action of Rapamycin

leading to increased E2F-driven gene transcription (31). Rapamycin decreased Rb phosphorylation levels, but addition
of octreotide almost eliminated them (Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
the combined octreotide-rapamycin treatment reduced E2F
transcriptional activity more potently than rapamycin alone
(P = 0.012; Fig. 4C), whereas octreotide alone had a small effect, which did not reach statistical significance. E2F transcription factors drive the transcription of several genes,
whose products are important for the transition to the
S phase, including cyclin E. The combined octreotiderapamycin treatment decreased cyclin E protein expression
more potently than each individual treatment alone
(Fig. 4D). Single octreotide treatment decreased cyclin E, similar to what was reported for the somatostatin analogue RC160 in CHO/SSTR2 cells (23) and somatostatin in pancreatic
acinar cells (32). Treatment with the protease inhibitor
MG132 did not affect cyclin E suppression after single or
combined octreotide and rapamycin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
These results suggest that the combined treatment decreases E2F transcriptional activity and cyclin E transcription, prohibiting the tumor cells from entering the S phase
of the cell cycle. However, the rapamycin-induced decrease
in CDK2 levels alone cannot explain the better suppressive
effect of the combined octreotide-rapamycin treatment on
E2F transcriptional activity and cyclin E transcription.

using anti–pIRS-1-Ser636/639 and anti–IRS-1. Representatives of three
experiments are shown.

Therefore, the mechanism behind the superior antiproliferative action of their combination was sought among the proteins important for the G1-S cell cycle transition. Cell cycle
progression starts with the activation of D-type cyclins and
their associated kinases CDK4 and CDK6 (29). Rapamycin
alone or in combination with octreotide decreased cyclin
D1, cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6 (Fig. 4A), whereas octreotide
alone had no effect and did not potentiate the effect of rapamycin, suggesting that the potent antiproliferative action of
the combined treatment is not due to a more potent suppression of D-type cyclins.
The G1 to S transition is primarily governed by the cyclin
E/CDK2 complex (30). Single and combined rapamycin treatment decreased CDK2 protein levels (Fig. 4A). Cyclin E/CDK2
complexes act by hyperphosphorylating and inhibiting Rb.
The resulting pRb dissociates from E2F transcription factors,

complex is the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27/Kip1. Single octreotide and rapamycin treatments increased p27/Kip1 protein levels, similar to what was described in previous studies
(23, 33), but their combination had a stronger effect on p27/
Kip1 transcript (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and protein levels
(Fig. 5A). These data suggest that increased p27/Kip1 transcription is an adjuvant mechanism by which the combined
treatment exerts its superior antiproliferative action. Indeed,
knocking down p27/Kip1 abolished the antiproliferative action of the combined octreotide-rapamycin treatment without affecting that of the single rapamycin treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). Furthermore, adding octreotide
to rapamycin treatment in the GH3 cells, which do not express p27/Kip1 (34), did not enhance the antiproliferative effect of rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
The stronger effect of the combined treatment on p27/
Kip1 indicates that the two drugs may induce p27/Kip1
through different pathways. The stimulatory effect of octreotide on basal and rapamycin-induced p27/Kip1 was not observed in AtT-20 cells transfected with SHP-1dn (Fig. 5B) or
with a constitutively active Myr-Akt (Fig. 5C), whereas neither intervention affected rapamycin. Instead, the stimulatory action of rapamycin on p27/Kip1 was blocked after
inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) with
20 mmol/L lithium chloride (Supplementary Fig. S5D) or
14 μmol/L of the selective inhibitor SB415286 (Fig. 5D).

Resistance to cytotoxic and cytostatic treatments is a common limitation in cancer treatment. Rapamycin resistance
was in part attributed to the rapamycin-induced increase
in pAkt-Ser473 levels, which was documented in vitro and
in vivo on biopsies of patients treated with the rapalog
RAD001 (7) and was found to derive from the elimination
of the negative feedback loop of the mTOR target p70 S6K
on the PI3K pathway. In the present study, we sought to suppress the PI3K pathway upstreams with a somatostatin
analogue that was previously shown to target this pathway
(14, 15) to restore the control of Akt and therefore induce
sensitivity to rapamycin treatment.
The serine/threonine kinase p70 S6K phosphorylates IRS-1
at serine residues, causing its inactivation. Rapamycin, by
inhibiting mTOR, decreases p70 S6K activity and reduces serine IRS-1 phosphorylation, leading to its activation. Octreotide was previously reported to inhibit IRS-1 by decreasing
its tyrosine phosphorylation levels through the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (14). Herein, we show that it also increases IRS-1 serine phosphorylation levels and, in particular,
pIRS-1-Ser636/639, which is the site primarily phosphorylated
by p70 S6K. Interestingly, this effect was also SHP-1 dependent. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 was previously reported
to bind to another phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP2C)
and to get dephosphorylated and inhibited through this association (35). Whether SHP-1 plays a similar role in regulating IRS-1 remains to be determined. Nevertheless, it is
noteworthy that the basal levels of pIRS-Ser636/639 in the cells
transfected with the catalytically inactive SHP-1 were higher

than those of the control cells, suggesting that changes in tyrosine phosphorylation undermine the IRS-1 serine phosphorylation status.
Single and combined rapamycin treatment decreased mTOR
phosphorylation at both Ser2448 and Ser2481, similar to previous
studies (36). However, the rapamycin-suppressed p70 S6K phosphorylation was not altered by cotreatment with octreotide,
indicating that the effect of octreotide on rapamycin-induced
IRS-1 is not due to an action of the drug on p70 S6K.
Octreotide enhanced the antiproliferative action of rapamycin in immortalized mouse pituitary tumor cells that responded poorly to the antiproliferative action of rapamycin
and in human pituitary tumors in primary cell culture. The
present study focused on NFPAs, which were shown to display high levels of activated Akt compared with normal pituitary or with other pituitary tumor types and could therefore
be a good candidate for treatment with rapamycin (25). In
our study, more than half of the cases could not respond
to rapamycin, suggesting resistance to this treatment. It is
noteworthy that addition of octreotide improved the antiproliferative action of rapamycin not only in rapamycin-resistant
tumors but also in rapamycin responders. The improvement
of the antiproliferative action of rapamycin by octreotide was
not due to its own growth-inhibiting effect in NFPA because
only few cases responded to single octreotide treatment,
reflecting in vitro (37) and in vivo (38–40) observations.

Interestingly, the superior effect of the combined treatment
was present even at low rapamycin concentrations. These
findings suggest that the same antiproliferative effect can
be achieved at lower pharmacologic doses of the rapamycin
analogs, which is of clinical importance considering their
relative toxicity at high doses (41).
Searching for mechanisms mediating the superior antiproliferative effect of the combined treatment downstream to
IRS-1/Akt suppression, we focused on the G1-S cell cycle
transition because the combined treatment arrested the cells
in the G0-G1 phase. Rapamycin decreased cyclin D1, cyclin
D3, CDK4, CDK6, and CDK2 similar to what was described
in previous studies (42–44). Addition of octreotide did not
potentiate this action, but it nevertheless suppressed Rb
phosphorylation, E2F transcriptional activity, and the E2F
transcriptional target cyclin E more potently than rapamycin
treatment alone. Both octreotide and rapamycin were previously shown to suppress cyclin E (20, 32, 45, 46), so this
finding is not surprising. However, these data collectively indicate a strong inhibitory action on CDK2 activity, upstream
to cyclin E, which cannot be explained only by the rapamycin-induced decrease in CDK2. Cyclin E/CDK2 activity
is negatively regulated primarily by the cell-dependent
kinase inhibitor p27/Kip1, which was previously reported
to be upregulated by octreotide and rapamycin (23, 33).
Nevertheless, the combination of the two drugs strongly

enhanced p27/Kip1 expression, providing with an additional
mechanism for its superior antiproliferative action downstreams at cell cycle level. Indeed, cells in which p27/Kip1
was knocked down or do not express p27, such as the GH3
cells, failed to better respond to the combined octreotiderapamycin treatment compared with the individual
treatments.
The extent of the p27/Kip1 upregulation after the combined octreotide-rapamycin treatment suggests that the
two drugs may use different pathways to induce this cell cycle inhibitor. The action of octreotide on p27/Kip1 was SHP-1
dependent, reflecting previous studies in pituitary tumor
cells (15). Interestingly, Akt overexpression also abolished
the stimulatory effect of octreotide, indicating that Akt overactivation may block the cytostatic action of octreotide in pituitary tumor cells. Indeed, Akt overexpression eliminated
the antiproliferative action of octreotide in the AtT-20 pituitary tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). These data raise
the interesting possibility that Sst2-expressing tumors with
overactivated Akt may be more resistant to the antiproliferative action of somatostatin analogues that target mainly this
receptor, such as octreotide and lanreotide. In contrast, the
effect of rapamycin did not depend on SHP-1 or Akt but on
GSK3β, which, as a downstream target of p70 S6K (47), is
activated by rapamycin (48).
Inhibition of the PI3K pathway upstreams could facilitate
tumor cells to respond to rapamycin by inhibiting mitogenic
and survival signaling and cell cycle progression. In previous
studies, addition of small-molecule inhibitors against PI3K
(12) or insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (7) abolished
the rapalog-induced Akt phosphorylation and improved its
efficacy. In the present study, we chose to target the PI3K

pathway with a biological acting on a G protein–coupled receptor. Sst2 is present on neuroendocrine tumors, and targeting this receptor with somatostatin analogs, such as
octreotide, constitutes a first-line pharmacologic treatment
for these tumors (16). Using a Sst2 agonist to target the
PI3K pathway and improve the antitumor action of rapamycin could ensure a tumor-specific action. While the present
study was ongoing, the combination of octreotide long-acting
repeatable and the rapalog RAD001 (everolimus) went in
phase II clinical trials for the treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumors and was shown to be well tolerated with
promising antitumor activity (49). Our observation that octreotide can sensitize tumor cells to lower concentrations
of rapamycin indicates that a beneficial effect can be expected after treatment with lower doses of the drug, which
is important in case of adverse side effects. Clinical trials are
needed to address the efficacy of the combined treatment in
patients with NFPA and other neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, two recent studies in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cell lines failed to show improvement of the
antiproliferative action of rapamycin after addition of octreotide (50, 51). In our study, the same outcome was observed in
the GH3 pituitary tumor cells and was attributed to the lack
of p27/Kip1 in these cells (34). Intrinsic differences in each
individual tumor are suspected to be responsible for these
discrepancies, and future studies are essential to identify factors that may contribute to resistance to the beneficial effects of the combined treatment.
Summarizing, in the present study, we showed that octreotide blocks one of the mechanisms that are suspected to be
responsible for rapamycin resistance in a mechanism involving SHP-1, decreased IRS-1 tyrosine, and increased IRS-1

serine phosphorylation. These events lead to suppressed
pAkt-Ser473 levels and increased p27/Kip1, which blocks
CDK2 activity and eventually cell cycle progression. The
herein described mechanistic background indicates
that adding somatostatin analogues to rapamycin analogue
treatment could efficiently limit growth not only in NFPA
but also in other somatostatin receptor–expressing tumor
types for which treatment with mTOR inhibitors is indicated.
