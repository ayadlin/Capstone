ABSTRACT
In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mutation and loss of p53 and ATM
abrogate DNA damage signalling and predict poorer response and shorter survival.
We hypothesised that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity, which is crucial
for repair of DNA breaks induced by oxidative stress or chemotherapy, may be an
additional predictive biomarker and a target for therapy with PARP inhibitors.
We measured PARP activity in 109 patient-derived CLL samples, which varied
widely (192 – 190052 pmol PAR/106 cells) compared to that seen in healthy volunteer
lymphocytes (2451 – 7519 pmol PAR/106 cells). PARP activity was associated
with PARP1 protein expression and endogenous PAR levels. PARP activity was not
associated with p53 or ATM loss, Binet stage, IGHV mutational status or survival,
but correlated with Bcl-2 and Rel A (an NF-kB subunit). Levels of 8-hydroxy-2’deoxyguanosine in DNA (a marker of oxidative damage) were not associated with PAR
levels or PARP activity. The potent PARP inhibitor, talazoparib (BMN 673), inhibited
CD40L-stimulated proliferation of CLL cells at nM concentrations, independently of
Binet stage or p53/ATM function.
PARP activity is highly variable in CLL and correlates with stress-induced
proteins. Proliferating CLL cells (including those with p53 or ATM loss) are highly
sensitive to the PARP inhibitor talazoparib.

that may be exploited therapeutically. Current treatment

aggressive therapies. The development of biomarkers to
stratify subgroups of patients for personalised medicine is
therefore crucial to achieve the best therapeutic outcomes
for these patients.
Cytogenetic abnormalities including mutation
and loss of p53 and ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase
(ATM) (del(17p) and del(11q) respectively) confer
chemoresistance and are associated with poorer response
and shorter overall survival [3, 4]. Both ATM and p53
signal DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) with ATM
also promoting their high-fidelity repair by homologous
recombination repair (HRR). These phenotypes were
recently found to impact on the newer kinase inhibitors
that target BCR signalling. Although the mechanism
of action of the BTK inhibitors is p53-independent,
underlying genomic instability in patients with p53 and
ATM loss can result in acquired mutations in the kinase,
resulting in drug resistance [5].
	 We reasoned that genomic instability arising
from unresolved single-strand DNA breaks may also be
important in response to DNA damaging therapy in CLL.
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is activated by
DNA strand breaks and is pivotal in the signalling to their
repair [6]. Since PARP1 has a key role in the response
to DNA damage, it is currently being pursued as a drug
target in several clinical trials [7]. We co-developed the
first clinically-used PARP inhibitor [8] for combination
chemotherapy but subsequent studies identified the
synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitor monotherapy in
HRR-defective (HRD) tumours, notably those with BRCA
mutations [9, 10]. Importantly, PARP1 is known to be part
of the first line of defence against oxidative stress, which
is increased in cancer and associated with poor prognosis
in CLL [11].
In agreement with the known synthetic lethality of
PARP inhibitors in HRD tumours, ATM-defective CLL
can call be selectively targeted by the PARP inhibitor,
olaparib [12]. A phase I/II clinical trial is investigating the
use of olaparib in CLL patients stratified by ATM status
(11q deletion or ATM mutation: ISRCTN34386131 http://
www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN34386131) and phase I studies
of talazoparib have been undertaken in haematological
malignancies (NCT01399840).
A comprehensive analysis of PARP1 function
in CLL is lacking. We previously observed that PARP
activity was very high in a pilot cohort of CLL cases [13]
and hypothesised that defects in DNA repair (e.g. loss
of p53 or ATM function), response to oxidative stress or
oncogene activation could lead to up-regulation of PARP1
and greater reliance on PARP activity for survival of
CLL cells. We hypothesised therefore that PARP activity
could not only be a key determinant of patient sensitivity
to chemotherapies that stimulate PARP activity, but
also to PARP inhibitors themselves. Here, we analysed
the expression and activity of PARP1 in a large cohort
of patient-derived CLL cells (n = 109). We found that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PARP activity was highly variable in CLL patients, and
tended to be higher than PBMCs from healthy volunteers
(HV). PARP activity and/or PARP1 protein levels were
associated with levels of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl2,
and the DNA binding of the stress-induced transcription
factor NF-kB subunit, RelA. PARP activity was not
associated with ATM dysfunction or levels of oxidative
DNA damage and the potent PARP inhibitor talazoparib
inhibited the growth of patient derived CLL cells at low
concentrations, even in cells with functional HRR.

RESULTS
PARP activity is more variable in CLL cells than
in PBMCs from healthy volunteers
PARP activity and endogenous PAR levels in
patient-derived CLL samples (109 and 90 samples,
respectively) were more variable than in PBMCs from
HV (n = 8, age 25-51, mean 37). In CLL samples there
was an approximately 1,000-fold difference from highest
to lowest (192- 190052, mean = 11968; median = 5615
pmol PAR formed/106 cells, coefficient of variation =
1.92) compared to PBMCs (3-fold variation) from HV
(range = 2452 - 7519, mean = 4365; median = 3315 pmol
PAR formed/106 cells, coefficient of variation = 0.47)
(Figure 1A, left). Similarly, endogenous PAR levels were
also highly variable ( > 4,000-fold) in CLL cells (0.7 3090 pmol, mean = 110; median = 6.0 pmol PAR/106
cells, coefficient of variation = 3.33) compared to HV
lymphocytes (3.66 - 52.9 pmol mean = 13.8; median =
8.8 pmol PAR/106 cells, coefficient of variation = 0.88)
and there was a population of cells that had particularly
high levels (Figure 1A, right). PARP activity significantly
correlated with endogenous PAR levels (p = 0.01 r =
0.27; Supplementary Figure S1). Variable PARP activity
and endogenous PAR levels were observed across all
cytogenetic groupings with no obvious relationship
between PARP activity (Figure 1B) or endogenous PAR
levels (Figure 1C) and cytogenetic abnormalities, and no
obvious distinction between treated and untreated patients.
Some patients’ CLL cells were sampled on more than one
occasion from diagnosis through their disease course,
and measurement of PARP activity did not reveal any
particular trend in PARP activity over the course of disease
(supplementary Figure S2). These data suggest that neither
cytogenetics nor prior therapy influence PARP activity in
CLL.

relationship was stronger (r = 0.562) (Figure 2C). PARP
has been implicated in the apoptotic process; not only
is it cleaved by caspases but PAR formation promotes
apoptosis inducing factor release from the mitochondrion
and nuclear translocation triggering caspase-independent
apoptosis [16]. However, there was no correlation between
PARP1 levels and RelA (a component of the stressactivated pro-survival transcriptional activator protein
complex NFkB) binding to DNA (Figure 2D). RelA DNA
binding did correlate with PARP activity in the CLL
samples (Figure 2E, n = 65; p = 0.045) but the relationship
was weak (r = 0.25).

Since the data on cytogenetic abnormalities in Figure
1 may not definitively reflect p53 and ATM function, we
analysed the distribution of PARP activity in 102 patients
stratified according to their p53 status, including those
cases that had TP53 mutation without del(17p) (n = 86 wild
type (WT) and p53 mutant (M) n = 16) but there was still
no significant correlation (p = 0.15, Mann Whitney, Figure
3A). Similarly, we examined whether the functional status
of ATM, a key player in HRR, had any relationship with
PARP activity. Approximately 60% of del(11q) cases have
fully functional ATM, and only those cases with biallelic
loss of ATM (with mutation on the remaining allele) have
non-functional ATM. Therefore, we stratified the del(11q)

to auto-phosphorylate (ser1981) and phosphorylate SMC1, (Supplementary figure S3). In the 46 cases evaluated,
there was no difference in PARP activity between those
with functional (n = 34) or non-functional (n = 12)
ATM (p = 0.42) (Figure 3B, supplementary Table S2).
Similarly, endogenous PAR levels did not correlate with
p53 or ATM function (supplementary Figure S4A, S4B,
Table S2). PARP activity was not significantly associated
with any particular cytogenetic abnormality (del(13q)
versus del(17p)/TP53, n = 98, p = 0.13 Mann Whitney;
Figure 3C). Similarly, endogenous PAR levels were not

associated with cytogenetic abnormalities, supplementary
Figure S4C). PARP activity had a tendency to be higher
in patients with progressive disease, defined as Binet
stage B or C (n = 46), compared to those with nonprogressive disease, Binet stage A, (n = 57) but again, this
was not significant (p = 0.08 Mann Whitney, Figure 3D).
Endogenous PAR levels did not correlate with disease
progression (n = 84;p = 0.47, supplementary Figure

were related to IGHV mutation status (p = 0.94 and 0.39,
respectively), data not shown.

Samples 175, 191, 200 and 206 were exposed to talazoparib using CD40L co-culture method 1, where cells were cultured
in talazoparib containing media 72 – 168 hr post seeding. Samples 193, 199 and 208 which had pre-exposure to talazoparib

in Figure 1A) was due to high levels of oxidative stress.
There was no relationship between 8-OHdG levels and
the cytogenetic groups or in response to prior therapy
(Figure 4A), PARP activity (Figure 4B) or endogenous
PAR (Figure 4C), implying that the highly variable PARP
activity in CLL does not reflect levels of oxidative stress.

Since PARP activity is a continuous variable,
we used ROC curve survival analysis to examine the
impact of PARP activity on patient outcome. Maximally
stimulated PARP activity and basal PAR levels did not
have clinically relevant discriminatory power using ROC
curve survival analysis at 2.5 years and 5 years (30 and 60
months) post-diagnosis (supplementary figure S7). AUC
values of below 0.75 were deemed to be of no clinical
significance [17] with relation to PARP as a prognostic
marker in CLL.

Talazoparib inhibits the growth of CLL cells
irrespective of ATM and HRR status
By culturing CLL cells on an irradiated monolayer
expressing the CD40 ligand (CD40L), CLL cells can be
induced to proliferate, making growth inhibition studies
possible [18], and pilot studies confirmed induction of
proliferation (Supplementary Figure S5). PARP inhibitors
are synthetically lethal to cells with HRR dysfunction and
ATM is thought to function in the HRR pathway [12].
In initial studies using CLL samples from 4 patients,
(including an ATM dysfunctional and a del11q case)
proliferating CLL cells cultured on the CD40L-expressing
cells for 72 hr were exposed to talazoparib (0- 10,000 nM)
( Method 1). Cell counting over 96-168 hr, (i.e. 72 hr
exposure) revealed a concentration-dependent suppression
of cell growth (Figure 5A left panel) with GI50 values
between 19 and > 1000 nM talazoparib (Table 1). It has
been suggested that high PARP activity is associated with
HRR defects [19], although our data do not indicate that
ATM defects are associated with higher PARP activity
(Figure 3B). To investigate if PARP activity was related to
HRR status and hence sensitivity to talazoparib, 3 further
CLL samples (193, 199 and 208) with high, medium or
low PARP activity and low or high endogenous PAR levels
(Table 1) were stimulated to proliferate on a CD40L-

8-OHdG levels do not correlate with PARP
activity, endogenous PAR levels, cytogenetic
abnormalities, p53 functional status, or treatment
status
PARP is activated by DNA breaks, with the most
common endogenous cause of these breaks being oxidative
stress/reactive oxygen species (ROS). 8-OHdG is the
predominant form of ROS-induced DNA damage. ROS
levels are reported to be higher in CLL and associated
with poor prognosis [11]. Therefore, to determine if ROSinduced DNA damage was associated with cytogenetic
abnormalities or PARP activity, or if the endogenous PAR
levels reflected the level of ongoing DNA damage, we
measured 8-OHdG in DNA extracted from 56 treatmentnaïve or pre-treated CLL patient samples (Figure 4).
In particular, we wanted to determine if the outlier

expressing layer, and exposed to talazoparib (0 nM 1,000 nM) after a 72 hr talazoparib pre-exposure period
(method 2). Cell counts over the same 96-168 hr timeperiod demonstrated a profound suppression of growth by
all concentrations of talazoparib with GI50 values of < 25
- 30 nM (Figure 5A right panel, supplementary figure S6).
Although these data seem to imply that ATM dysfunction
confers resistance to talazoparib, a direct comparison
cannot be made between data from method 1 and 2 due to
the differences in the pre-exposure period. However, using
method 1, sample 200 (which had non-functional ATM)
had a 10-fold higher GI50 value than sample 191 (which
had functional ATM).
To further determine whether sensitivity was a
result of defective HRR, cells exposed to 1000 nM
talazoparib or vehicle were harvested and HRR function
determined by measuring γH2AX and RAD51 foci. A ≥2fold increase in γH2AX foci was taken as confirmation
that stalled/collapsed replication forks and/or DSB had
been generated. Cells were defined as HRR competent
if a ≥2-fold increase in RAD51 foci was also observed
as previously described [20, 21]. Samples 193 and 199
generated analysable results. Both CLL samples were
HRR competent (Figure 5B and 5C). Patient 208 also
displayed an increase in RAD51 foci indicating HRR
competence, however the staining was too poor to analyse
fully (data not shown). This suggests that even HRR
competent CLL cells are sensitive to talazoparib.

modulation of PARP activity we examined associated
clinical data. Treatment status (treatment-naïve as opposed
to having received treatment), IGHV status, adverse
cytogenetic abnormalities or Binet stage did not have a
significant impact on the level of PARP activity. However,
we noted that there was a trend for PARP activity to be
higher in patients with Binet stage B or C and in patients
with p53 defects (Figure 3). We therefore examined PARP
activity in sequential samples taken from the same patient
(Figure S2), but there was no particular trend in PARP
activity over the course of disease.
We had hypothesised that PARP activity may be
related to underlying genomic instability, (due to p53 or
ATM loss), because such cells may be reliant on PARP
function for repair of DNA damage. In fact, our data
suggest that neither p53 nor ATM loss closely correlate
with PARP function. In our cohort, 16/102 patients lacked
p53 function, but neither PARP activity nor endogenous
PAR levels were significantly related to p53 status. This
indicates that in CLL PARP activity is not required in
response to the genomic instability and compromised
DNA damage signalling resulting from loss of p53. This
contrasts somewhat with a recent publication [24] that
found PARP1 expression was lower in CLL samples with
mutated TP53 and unmutated IGHV, and that apoptosis
positively correlated with PARP1 expression. However, in
that study PARP1 protein levels and activity were only
determined in a small subset of samples after irradiation
and, because PARP activity is only partially dependent
on its protein level and concordance between mRNA
and protein levels is highly variable [24, 26], we believe
determination of PARP function is a more robust indicator
of the cellular phenotype.
Defects in HRR are known to confer sensitivity
to PARP inhibitors due to the accumulation of SSB in
PARP-inhibited cells that would normally be resolved at
replication by HRR [27]. ATM promotes HRR, and lack
of ATM has been shown to result in sensitivity to the
PARP inhibitor, olaparib in replicating CLL cells [12].
We postulated that CLL cells lacking ATM might be more
dependent on PARP and therefore have increased PARP
activity. Since del(11q) status alone does not necessarily
confer ATM loss (as mutation or loss of the second allele
is needed for complete inactivation) we assessed ATM
function in selected cases . In 12/46 cases with nonfunctional ATM, PARP activity was similar to cases with
functional ATM, suggesting that ATM dysfunction does
not result in an increased reliance on PARP activity. This
confirms a lack of association between HRR function and
PARP activity previously observed in primary cultures of
cells in ovarian cancer ascites [A Mukhopadhyay, PhD
thesis, Newcastle University 2011].
To probe the role of ATM and HRR status further,
and assess PARP as a therapeutic target in CLL, we
analysed the effect the highly potent PARP inhibitor,
talazoparib (cell-free IC50 = 0.57 nM, [27] on the

DISCUSSION
Here we show, for the first time, a comprehensive
analysis of the activity and expression of PARP1 in a
large cohort of CLL tumours. PARP activity was found
to be highly variable among the 109 cases analysed
ranging from 200-190,000 pmol PAR/106 CLL cells,
i.e. almost 1,000-fold variation. B-cells are reported to
have approximately 2-fold higher PARP1 protein levels
compared to T cells [22], but some patients had values >
10,000 pmol/106 cells, far higher than previously reported
for normal PBMCs. By comparison, PARP activity was
less variable in PBMCs from HVs, and although this was
from a small cohort (n = 8) it was within the range seen
in a separate HV cohort (n = 56) in our previous study
(10 - 2,190 pmol PAR/106cells; [23]). In the CLL cohort
studied here, although approximately 1/3 patients had
higher PARP activity than HV, median PARP activity was
not significantly different in CLL cases, largely due to the
huge variation in activity in the cohort.
To understand the variation in PARP activity
observed, we measured PARP1 protein levels and
discovered that, although there was a significant
correlation between protein levels and activity, the strength
of the correlation was weak as observed previously [23].
This suggests that the activity of PARP1 is influenced
by post-translational modification. To understand this

proliferation of CLL cells using the CD40L-stimulated
co-culture model. Here, we used two different culture
conditions to allow us to test different exposure times to
study the effect of talazoparib on proliferating CLL cells,
including the conditions that were previously used [12]
and had enough material available to examine a sample
which was confirmed as ATM non-functional (CLL 200,
Figure 5 and supplementary figure S3) and another with
confirmed p53 loss (CLL 199). We found that sensitivity
to talazoparib was independent of the ATM functional
status of the cells, in contrast to previous studies showing
that ATM dysfunctional CLL cells were more sensitive to
the PARP inhibitor, olaparib [12]. Duration of exposure
to talazoparib at concentrations of 10 nM appears to be
important to achieve high levels of cytotoxicity, since
samples exposed for 168 hours versus 72 hours had lower
GI50 values. A sub-population of cells appear capable of
proliferation even at higher concentrations of talazoparib,
and this may reflect an intrinsically resistant subpopulation in a heterogeneous population of CLL cells.
Our previous studies indicated that a 30 min pulse with
talazoparib reduced PARP activity in HV PBMCs cells
with an IC50 of approximately 7±6 nM (James Murray,
unpublished data) suggesting that PARP activity probably
needs to be suppressed by > 50% for growth inhibition. In
our studies the case with confirmed p53 loss (CLL 199)
had similar sensitivity to talazoparib compared to cases
with wild type p53. Since p53 loss remains the main
indicator of refractory disease, these data present the
exciting possibility that talazoparib is effective at reducing
proliferation of CLL cells in this difficult-to-treat patient
population. All of the samples tested had functional HRR,
but this was not associated with resistance to talazoparib.
Interestingly, using both method 1 and method 2 to
evaluate talazoparib cytotoxicity, the cells with the highest
PARP activity, CLL 208 (method 1) and 191 (method 2),
were the most sensitive.
Since our data suggested that neither p53 nor ATM
status were determinants of intrinsic PARP activity or
sensitivity to PARP inhibition, we explored other factors
that may alter PARP activity. Bcl-2 is an important prosurvival protein, and a member of a family of proteins
that dictate the balance between survival and apoptosis. In
CLL, Bcl-2 is frequently highly expressed and associated
with disease progression [15] and as such, is being
explored as a target in current clinical trials for CLL and
other malignancies [28]. We observed high expression
of Bcl-2 in the subset of the cohort we analysed, and
found that levels of Bcl-2 significantly correlated with
PARP expression. Our results suggest that CLL cells
may rely more on PARP function, or increase PARP
function to promote repair and survival, and in parallel
upregulate pro-survival signalling, including Bcl-2 to
inhibit apoptosis. In agreement with this, we also found
that levels of the NF-κB subunit, RelA, were associated
with high PARP activity. NF-κB induces transcription of a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

large repertoire of stress-response genes in CLL, including
the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 [29], allowing
us to speculate that stress-induced activation of PARP, and
NF-κB in CLL cells occurs as a mechanism of protecting
CLL cells from damage.
Endogenous PAR levels varied widely between
samples. CLL cells are known to have high levels of
reactive oxygen species [11], resulting in increased
8-OHdG DNA lesions that activate PARP. However
measurement of 8-OHdG in DNA extracted from a subset
of our cohort of CLL samples with high, intermediate
or low PAR levels did not reveal a relationship between
either endogenous PAR levels or PARP activity and levels
of 8-OHdG. It should be recognised that the levels of
8-OHdG represent a balance between induction of DNA
damage and its repair, and PAR levels reflect both ongoing
synthesis by PARP and degradation by PARG. Therefore,
although one might expect high levels of 8-OHdG to
be associated with high levels of endogenous PAR, it is
possible that in cases where high PAR levels were found
in CLL samples with low 8-OHdG, this may have reflected
high rates of repair, conversely high levels of 8-OHdG
in the absence of high PAR may reflect reduced rates of
repair and/or high PARG activity.
We wanted to determine whether PARP activity
had any impact on outcome in our cohort. Preliminary
analysis using median cut-off values suggested that high
PARP activity was associated with poorer overall survival
(OS) [13], however, since PARP activity is a continuous
variable, we used ROC analysis to more accurately
analyse effects on outcome. We found no association with
PARP activity and survival, which is in agreement with
our analysis of other clinical correlates such as cytogenetic
abnormalities and disease progression, where we found
that PARP activity was not strongly linked to clinical
outcome.
In conclusion, our data suggest that neither PARP1
expression nor activity correlate strongly with adverse
cytogenetic abnormalities, p53 or ATM function or stage
of disease, but it may be associated with anti-apoptotic
proteins. However, encouragingly, our data show that, in
an albeit limited number of ex vivo cultures, CLL cells
were sensitive to talazoparib cytotoxicity independent of
their p53, ATM or HRR status, confirming that PARP is a
therapeutic target in CLL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection and processing
This study was approved by the UK NHS
Research Ethics Service, and patient samples are part
of the Newcastle Haematology Biobank http://www.
ncl.ac.uk/nbb/collections/nhb. Patient information is
43987

Oncotarget

described in supplementary Table S1. Following written
informed consent, patients provided peripheral blood
samples which were transported to the laboratory and
processed immediately using Lymphoprep (Axis Shield,
Cambridgeshire, UK). Sample collection, processing and
storage were carried out in accordance with the regulations
of the Human Tissue Act 2004 (UK) and local guidelines.
Binet staging refers to the patient status at the time of
sample collection. All chemicals were obtained from
Sigma Aldrich (UK) unless otherwise stated.

CLL cells that had been stored at -80°C were thawed on
ice and washed in PBS prior to assay. Endogenous PAR
levels were measured in unreacted (i.e. in the absence
of oligonucleotide or NAD+) cells. Because endogenous
PAR levels were low, the maximum number possible were
loaded, ranging from 4x103 to 2.5x105 permeabilised cells.
Samples were assayed in duplicate, with PARP activity
represented as mean recalculated PAR (pmol/106 cells).

Determination of ATM function

Cytogenetic analyses

CLL cells were treated with ionizing radiation (IR, 5
Gy, Gulmay Medical Xstrahl RS320 X-irradiator (Gulmay
Medical, Chertsey, UK). 45 minutes after IR treatment,
cell lysates were prepared as described above and western
blots were probed with antibodies to ATM (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), and (where possible) SMC1 (Millipore,
MA, USA) and ATM-specific phosphorylation targets;
pATM (ser1981) and pSMC1 (ser 966) (Cambridge
Bioscience, Cambridge UK). Samples showing clear
phosphorylation of ATM (ser1918) and SMC1 (ser966)
following IR treatment were deemed ATM functional [4].

Interphase FISH and a multiple ligation dependent
probe assay were used to determine cytogenetic
abnormalities as previously described [30]. CLL cell
DNA was extracted from 5 x 106 lymphocytes using a
QIAmp DNA blood mini kit according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen, UK). TP53 mutational status was
determined by targeted next generation sequencing (details
to be published separately) covering all coding exons (211) using a ROCHE 454 GS-FLX platform (performed by
NewGene, UK, http://www.newgene.org.uk).

Measurement of Bcl-2 levels

NF-κB DNA binding activity and expression

Levels of Bcl-2 were determined in CLL cell lysates,
prepared as described above, by Western Blotting using an
anti-Bcl-2 antibody (sc-509 Santa Cruz), B-actin (Sigma
A4700) and anti-mouse secondary antibody as described
above.

NF-κB activity was quantified in nuclear extracts
using the Trans-AM NF-кB family Transcription Factor
Assay ELISA Kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). A
standard curve (2 Gy-treated MDA-MB-231 cells) was
used to calculate arbitrary units (AU) per µg of nuclear
extract from the standard curve.

Oxidative DNA damage ELISA

Determination of PARP expression and activity

Detection and quantitation of 8-hydroxy-2’deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in DNA was carried out
using the 8-oxo-dG ELISA kit II (4380-096-K, Trevigen,
Maryland USA). The assay was carried out according to
manufacturer’s protocol, with the exception of altering
the standard curve range from 25 nM - 0.39 nM, to
accommodate for lower 8-OHdG levels. 8-OHdG values
were interpolated from standard curves, which were
generated as per manufacturer’s instructions. The final
8-OHdG values represent the amount of 8-OHdG (nM)
per µg DNA.

Whole-cell extracts were prepared using
PhosphosafeTM Extraction Reagent (Novagen), and
proteins separated using Criterion XT 3-8% Trisacetate (v/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad),
transferred onto Hybond C membrane (Amersham) and
probed with anti-PARP-1 primary antibody (C2-10,
Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) then anti-mouse HRPlinked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology)
and ECL reagent (Amersham) detection. Quantification
was performed using a Fuji LAS-3000 luminescent
image analyzer system (Raytek, Sheffield, UK). PARP
activity was determined in 103 digitonin-permeabilised
cells (CLL or HV PBMCs) by immunoblotting for the
product, PAR, with anti-PAR 10H Ab, following maximal
stimulation with a palindromic DS oligonucleotide
(5′-CGGAATTCCG-3′; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK 10 µg/
ml final concentration) in the presence of excess NAD+
(350 μM) using a GCLP (Good clinical laboratory
practise)-validated assay as previously described [23].

to prevent proliferation and incubated at 37oC overnight.
CLL cells were thawed and resuspended at a density of
2 x 107 cells/mL in RPMI supplemented with 10 ng/mL
human interleukin-4. Cells were then seeded onto the
monolayer at a density of 1x107 per well and incubated at
37⁰C. Cells were monitored and began to proliferate after
approximately 72 hours.
After 72 hours, cells from duplicate wells were
counted as a pre-treatment control. In order to determine
optimal conditions, experiments were carried out in two
ways. Initially (samples 175, 191, 200 and 206), CLL
cells were co-cultured with CD40L-expressing cells for
96 hours before being re-seeded onto a fresh feeder layer
in culture medium containing talazoparib (provided by
BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.) for a further 72 hours
(‘method 1’). In subsequent experiments (samples 193,
199, 208), 72 hour-cultured CLL cells were transferred
onto fresh feeder layers in medium containing talazoparib.
Drug-containing medium was replenished with fresh
medium containing the same concentration of talazoparib
after 72 hours and cells were counted at 24 hour intervals
thereafter. Response to drug was measured for the last
72hr (between 96 - 168 hours drug exposure, ‘method 2’).
In both instances cell counts (Coulter counter, threshold
set at 5-12 µm: Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK)
were plotted (a) against time and (b) as a concentrationdependent response curve generated from the cell counts
at the terminal 72 hr exposure period as a % of the vehicle
control.

GRANT SUPPORT

Cells from the CD40L-stimulated cultures that
had been treated with vehicle or 1000 nM talazoparib
(method 2) were harvested after 144 hours and 1x104
cells/ml cytospun onto microscope slides (Shandon
Cytospin 2 centrifuge). Slides were dried, washed 2x in
PBS, fixed in cold methanol and stored at -20⁰C. Slides
were probed for γH2AX and RAD51 foci as described
previously (16) using anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X
(Ser139) (clone JBW301, Merck Millipore, Watford,
UK), anti-RAD51 antibody (PC130 Calbiochem, Merk
Millipore, Watford, UK) and secondary antibodies Alexa
Fluor 546 Goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 Goat
anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen, Life Technologies,
Paisley, UK). Coverslips were mounted over the cells in
media containing 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
(Vectashield, Peterborough, UK). The number of γH2AX
and RAD51 foci was analysed in > 500 cells per condition
using ImageJ software with an in-house spot-counting
macro [31].

As the data do not have Gaussian distributions,
Mann Whitney tests, Kruskal Wallis tests or Spearman
rank correlations were performed as indicated in results
using GraphPad Prism software (http://www.graphpad.
com).
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
survival analysis was performed to assess the predictive
accuracy of PARP activity at 2.5 and 5 years (30 and 60
months), [32]. The method uses time-dependent sensitivity,
specificity, and associated ROC curves to characterize the
predictive accuracy of a continuous marker, when the
outcome is a censored survival time. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) was determined using the true positive
(TP) and false positive (FP) rate, with an AUC value
below 0.75 deemed as having no clinical value. Analysis
was carried out in R using the risksetAUC function, part
of the risksetROC library R package version 1.0.3, URL:
http://CRAN.R-project.org/package = risksetROC). [33]
