ABSTRACT
A multi-center study from the French Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Group
confirmed that iron chelation therapy is an independent prognostic factor that can increase
the survival rate of patients who are suffering from transfusion-dependent low-risk MDS.
In this study, we aimed to explore this clinical phenomena in vitro, by exploring the
synergistic effect of the iron chelator Deferasirox (DFX) and the DNA methyl transferase
inhibitor Decitabine (DAC) in the leukemia cell lines SKM-1, THP-1, and K-562. Treatment
with both DFX or DAC promoted apoptosis, induced cell cycle arrest, and inhibited
proliferation in all three of these cell lines. The combination of DFX and DAC was much
greater than the effect of using either drug alone. DFX showed a synergistic effect with
DAC on cell apoptosis in all three cell lines and on cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in
K-562 cells. DFX decreased the ROS levels to varying degrees. In contrast, DAC increased
ROS levels and an increase in ROS was also noted when the two drugs were used in
combination. Treatment of cells with DAC induced re-expression of ABAT, APAF-1, FADD,
HJV, and SMPD3, presumably through demethylation. However the combination of DAC
and DFX just had strong synergistic effect on the re-expression of HJV.

dependency, resulting in secondary iron overload in which
elevation of serum ferritin (SF), heart failure, and liver
dysfunction are often observed [4]. Since the body has no
physiological mechanism to excrete excess iron, in order to
avoid secondary iron overload, patients receiving long-term
blood transfusion should be treated with iron chelation therapy
(ICT) according to the MDS Foundation’s guidelines [5].
In a recent multicenter study, the French
Myelodysplastic Syndromes Group (GFM) confirmed
that iron chelation therapy appears to improve survival
in heavily transfused, lower-risk MDS [2]. In this study,
they analyzed survival and cause of death in ninety-seven
low, or intermediate-1 (int-1) -risk patients from eighteen
centers, regularly transfused as outpatients, chelated or
not, who were studied for a month and followed for 2.5
years. In this heavily transfused cohort of low- and int1-risk MDS patients, a significant survival advantage
was seen in chelated patients, particularly in those who
had received sufficiently intensive chelation therapy [2].

INTRODUCTION
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a malignant
condition of bone marrow stem cells. It is characterized
by ineffective hemopoiesis of stem or progenitor cells,
which leads to peripheral blood cytopenias and may
progress to acute myeloid leukemia in some patients
[1]. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)
groups MDS patients into four prognostic categories and
the treatment of MDS varies according to risk group [2].
The clinical outcome for MDS remains discouraging,
although treatments such as immunomodulatory agents,
low-dose chemotherapy, and allogeneic blood or marrow
cell transplantation have been used, and “Active therapy”
was given only when the disease progressed to AML, or
resembled AML, in terms of severe cytopenias [3].
Currently, the most frequent treatment given to patients
with MDS is supportive care. This has led a substantial
subgroup of MDS patients to eventually develop transfusion

However, there is no precise understanding of the reason
for this survival advantage provided by ICT.
However, anecdotally, it is believed that the reason
iron therapy improves a patient’s prognosis is due to an
overall reduction in the iron load on the heart, liver, brain,
lung, kidney, and other vital organs. However, numerous
other studies have shown that some iron chelation
drugs have an anti-cancer action including Deferasirox.
Deferasirox (DFX) is a new oral iron chelator approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical
use since 2010. DFX shows better safety, tolerability,
convenience, with fewer adverse effects compared to
Deferoxamine (DFO), which had been the treatment of
choice for iron overload for the last 40 years [6]. Breccica
et al. summarized the potential pathogenic mechanisms
responsible for hematologic improvement induced by
DFX [7], such as a direct effect on neoplastic clone or
the bone marrow environment, promoting iron release
from iron stores, allowing use by hemopoietic tissue,
reduction of the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
[8], inhibition of m-TOR signaling [9], and inhibition of
NF-kB signaling [10].
The DNA methyl transferase inhibitors,
5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine (Decitabine
(DAC)) were approved as chemotherapeutics for the
treatment of MDS in 2004 and 2006, respectively. These
drugs both improve the outcome for patients with high
risk MDS, and ameliorate the cytopenias of MDS and
decrease the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow [11].
Numerous clinical trials have shown DAC to be effective
in MDS. In some iron chelation studies, including one
conducted by GFM, some of the patients were also taking
DAC. As a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, the DAC
mechanism of action involves relaxation of chromatin
structure by causing DNA demethylation or hemidemethylation. Chromatin relaxation leads to an increase
in transcription factor binding to promoters thereby
increasing gene transcription of target genes.
Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that
the iron chelator DFX, in addition to improving median
overall survival (OS) in MDS and AML patients, may
possess a distinct anti-tumor activity that also leads to an
improvement in prognosis for MDS and AML patients.
Furthermore, Pogribny et al. have provided experimental
proof for an interdependence between iron and epigenetic
regulatory mechanisms and suggested that modification of
intracellular iron metabolism by itself may enhance the
efficacy of epigenetic therapy in breast cancer [12]. Hence,
in this study we tried to understand if a similar relationship
existed in MDS and AML.
The aim of the present work was to study the
effect of DFX and DAC, and combinations of both, on
cell viability, apoptosis, and cell-cycle progression in the
human leukemia cell lines SKM-1, THP-1, and K-562
in vitro. We also examined ROS levels in each of these
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell types, since ROS play a critical role in hematopoietic
stem cell (HSC) metabolism [8]. In our previous work, we
discovered five MDS-related genes that are simultaneously
hyper-methylated and transcriptionally downregulated
[13–15]. Therefore, in this study, we also examined the
expression of these five genes, before and after treatment
with DFX and DAC, in the hope of finding if ICT can
promote their re-expression.

RESULTS
Combination treatment with DFX and DAC
showed a greater anti-proliferative effect on
leukemia cell lines compared to single-drug
treatment
To evaluate anti-proliferative effects, the three
leukemia cell lines, SKM-1, THP-1, and K-562 cells were
treated with DAC, DFX, or a combination of DAC and
DFX for 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. The results revealed
that increasing concentrations of both drugs, ranging
from 20 to 100 μM of DFX and 1 to 8 μM of DAC, all
significantly suppressed cell line viability in dose- and
time-dependent manners. Based on these single dose
response studies, the most effective concentration and
minimum effective dose of each drug was picked to create
different drug combinations including 20 μM DFX with
8 μM DAC, 100 μM DFX with 1 μM DAC, and 100 μM
DFX with 8 μM DAC, in order to evaluate the effect of
DFX in combination with DAC. Data with DFX and
DAC in different combinations suggested predominantly
synergistic or additive interactions for proliferation in all
cell lines. In SKM-1 cells, the cell viabilities when treated
with 100 μM DFX or 8 μM DAC alone for 24, 48, 72,
or 96 h were 86.01%, 40.75%, 16.68%, and 11.04% and
97.78%, 80.68%, 42.94%, and 35.15%, respectively. The
combination of the two drugs (100 μM DFX plus 8 μM
DAC) for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h decreased cell viability to
76.85%, 20.16%, 11.32%, 8.90%, respectively. Other
doses also showed the same trend (Figure 1A). These
results suggested that the combined treatment of DFX
and DAC showed a greater anti-proliferative effect on
the SKM-1 cell line, compared to treatment using DFX
or DAC alone. This synergistic anti-proliferative effect of
DFX and DAC was also observed in THP-1 and K-562
cells (Figure 1B, 1C).

The combination of DFX and DAC induced
more cells to undergo apoptosis than single-drug
treatment
Cell apoptosis is generally used as an indicator for
growth inhibition of cells following drug treatment. In
order to determine if cell apoptosis was involved in growth
inhibition in these cell lines induced by either individual
or combined treatment of DFX and DAC, we performed

flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V/PI staining. The
apoptotic fraction was considered as both early apoptotic
cells and late apoptotic cells. As shown in Figures 2
and 3, both drugs alone showed a significant dose- and
time-dependent induction of apoptosis in all three cell
lines. In SKM-1 cells, the fraction of apoptotic cells
was 33.74±0.96% and 17.26±1.65% after 72 h treatment
with 100 μM of DFX or 8 μM of DAC, respectively.
The fraction of apoptotic cells increased to 51.3±2.28%
with the combination of both drugs (P<0.0001). In
THP-1 cells, the apoptotic fraction was 47.32±3.56%
following treatment with 100 μM DFX alone for 72 h,
and 19.09±1.91% following treatment with 8 μM DAC
for 72 h alone. This fraction increased to 64.72±4.39%
with the combination treatment (P<0.0001). In K562 cells,

the apoptotic fraction was 50.85±5.87% following 100 μM
DFX treatment for 72 h, and 37.75±4.06% following
treatment with 8 μM DAC treated for 72 h. This fraction
increased to 69.34±5.95% with combination treatment
(P<0.0001). These results suggested that the combined use
of these two drugs induced cell apoptosis more efficiently
than either drug alone.

Effect of treatment with DFX and DAC alone or
in combination on cell-cycle distribution
To examine whether the growth inhibitory effect
of these compounds could be explained by alterations in
the cell-cycle, we examined the effects of DFX and DAC
alone, and in combination, on the cell cycle of these three

leukemia cell lines. We found that DFX caused SKM-1
and THP-1 cells to arrest in the G0/G1 phase in a dosedependent manner. However, in K562 cells, treatment with
DFX arrested cells at S phase. When treated with DAC, all
three cell lines showed a dose-dependent arrest in S phase.
Interestingly, when cells were treated with a combination
of the two drugs at various concentrations, the actual
concentrations of the two drugs used in each combination
seemed to determine which phase of the cell cycle the
cells arrest in. For example, the percentage of cells in the
G0/G1 phase in untreated SKM-1 cells was 56.84±3.14%.
When treated with 20 μM DFX or 100 μM DFX for 48 h,
the percentages of SKM-1 cells in the G0/G1 phase were
61.47±3.16% and 76.00±1.51%, respectively. When
SKM-1 cells were treated with 1 μM DAC or 8 μM DAC
for 48 h, the percentages of cells in the G0/G1 phase were
55.06±3.03% and 25.49±3.60%, respectively. After cotreatment with 8 μM DAC or DFX at 20 μM or 100 μM,
the percentages of cells in the G0/G1 phase decreased to
24.74±4.97% and 24.87±4.17%. This trend was similar
for treatment with DAC. After treatment with 1 μM DAC
combined with 100 μM DFX, the percentage of cells in
the G0/G1 phase increased to 76.61±3.82% (P<0.01). This
trend was similar for treatment with DFX. In THP-1 cells,
we obtained similar results; when a lower dose of DFX
was combined with a larger dose of DAC, the percentage
of cells in the G0/G1 phase decreased. Conversely, when
a larger dose of DFX was combined with a lower dose
of DAC, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase
increased. In K562 cells, both drugs decreased the
percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and, when treated
in combination, the additive effect was very evident. In
untreated K-562 cells, the percentage of cells in the G0/
G1 phase was 72.89±4.72%. When treated with either 100
μM DFX or 8 μM DAC for 48 h, the percentages of cells
in the G0/G1 phase were 12.95±3.80% and 22.13±2.88%,
respectively. After co-treatment with 100 μM DFX and
8 μM DAC, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase
decreased to 8.66±3.48% (P<0.01). (Figure 4 and Table 1).

respectively. After treatment with DAC at 1, 3, 5, or 8 μM
for 72 h, the ROS levels were 52.73±1.26%, 60.53±2.60%,
67.43±0.87%, and 73.87±0.25%, respectively. After
treatment with 8 μM DAC combined with DFX at either
20 μM or 100 μM, the ROS levels were 74.20±0.70% and
61.70±1.30%, respectively. After treatment with 1 μM
DAC combined with 100 μM DFX, the ROS levels was
56.37±1.17% (Figure 5A). In THP-1 and K-562 cells, the
results were similar to what was seen in SKM-1 cells, as
shown in Figure 5B. In conclusion, our results showed
DAC has a bigger influence on ROS levels in these cell
lines, compared to the effect of DFX.

Effect of treatment with DFX and DAC alone
and in combination on gene expression
Since DAC causes DNA demethylation, which can
regulate gene expression in cis by relaxing chromatin
structure [16], we analyzed the expression levels of five
genes, which had been previously been shown to be
hyper-methylated and down-regulated in MDS [13–15],
to identify whether the comparative advantage of DAC
is related to this mechanism. RT-qPCR was performed
72 h after drug treatment of cells. This time point was
chosen because the highest percentage of apoptotic cells
was observed in this time group. As shown in Figure 6,
all five of these genes were up-regulated to varying
degrees when these three leukemia cells were treated
with DAC (Figure 6). However, DFX treatment alone
had little impact on the expression of these genes; DFX in
combination with DAC appeared to have no obvious trend.
SMPD3 was the gene that showed the most sensitivity to
DAC; its expression was up-regulated significantly in all
cell lines and at all DAC concentrations. The magnitude of
up-regulation ranged from 5.04- to 74.35-fold when these
three cell lines were treated with 8 μM DAC (P<0.0001).
Individual treatment with DFX up-regulated SMPD3 only
in THP-1 cells at 50 and 100 μM. The combination of
1 μM DAC and 100 μM DFX up-regulated SMPD3 in
SKM-1 cells (P<0.05), and it was also up-regulated at all
DAC and DFX combinations in THP-1 cells (P<0.0001)
(Figure 6E).
After combination treatment with 8 μM DAC and
20 μM DFX, the expression level of HJV in THP-1 cells
increased significantly, which was much higher than when
using 8 μM DAC alone. This study therefore demonstrated
that the combination of DAC and DFX can promote reexpression of HJV.

Combination treatment with DFX and DAC
increased ROS levels mirroring the DAC effect
Since excess free iron in cells catalyzes the
generation of ROS which causes oxidative stress and ROS
levels can be impacted by iron chelators, we examined the
ROS levels in these leukemia cell lines. We found that
DFX treatment decreased cellular ROS levels in a dosedependent manner in all three leukemia cell lines, and
that DAC treatment had the opposite effect and increased
ROS levels. Interestingly, the effect of the combination
of the two drugs was consistent, overall trending in line
with the DAC alone response. The ROS level in untreated
SKM-1 cells was 49.33±2.18%. Following treatment
with DFX at 20, 50, or 100 μM for 72 h, the ROS levels
were 41.67±0.81%, 36.63±1.56%, and 23.37±0.59%,

DISCUSSION
Most MDS patients requiring red blood cell
transfusions may develop iron overload, which may
adversely affect organ function and survival rate [17]. Iron
chelation therapy (ICT) can effectively prevent and treat
iron overload, and this has been clearly demonstrated in

transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia and MDS
[18]. Recently, the French Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Group (GFM) found that ICT appears to improve survival
in heavily transfused lower risk MDS patients in a
multicenter study and the survival advantage persisted
as a powerful prognostic parameter for survival though
a multivariate Cox analysis [2]. Numerous studies have
shown that ICT can not only reduce the burden of iron
overload as a whole, but also exist several pathogenetic
mechanisms.
In our study, we investigated whether ICT has a
synergistic effect with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
treatment in vitro in three leukemic cell lines, SKM1, THP-1, and K-562 cells. It is worthy of note that
SKM-1 is a secondary AML cell line derived from a
76-year-old Japanese male patient with MDS. SKM-1
cells show karyotype abnormalities with del(9)(q13;q22),
del(17)t(17;?)(13;?), del(9q), i(17q) and t(17p), which
have been detected in MDS [19]. Nakagawa et al. believe
that this cell line may contribute to understanding the
pathogenesis of MDS and its leukemic progression [20].
Deferasirox (DFX), a new oral iron chelator,
was chosen as our experimental drug to treat these cell
lines, either alone or in combination with the DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor Decitabine (DAC). We found
that both drugs, either alone or in combination, can inhibit
cell growth and the level of inhibition was dose and time
dependent. Both DFX [9, 10, 21] and DAC [22–24] have
previously been shown to have anti-proliferative effects
in K562 cells in numerous experiments, consistent with
our results. We also found that these three cell lines had a
greater sensitivity to DFX than DAC, with approximately
an 89-94% reduction in proliferation at 100 μM DFX
for 96 h and a 54-71% reduction at 8 μM DAC for 96 h
compared to controls. Overall, the combination of DFX
and DAC at different concentrations produced either a
predominantly synergistic or additive interaction with
respect to proliferation in all three cell lines.
Several studies have demonstrated that DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors cause tumor cell death by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inducing apoptosis. DAC has also been reported to induce
apoptosis in various leukemia cell lines [11, 25, 26].
In addition DFX itself has also been shown to have
strong anti-proliferative effects by inducing apoptosis
in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and leukemia cell
lines [9, 27, 28]. Based on these facts, we performed
flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V/PI staining to
determine whether the growth inhibition observed in these
three cell lines, induced by the combination treatment with
DFX and DAC, is related to apoptosis. The data showed
that the combined use of DFX and DAC induced/caused a
higher percentage of cells to undergo apoptosis compared
to either DFX or DAC treatment alone (P<0.0001).
Therefore, we believe these drugs inhibited the growth of
leukemia cells, most likely through inducing apoptosis. We
also analyzed the effect of drug treatment on the number
of early apoptotic cells (annexin V+/PI-). Although the
results were not as clear as for the late apoptotic cells, the
trend was consistent.
However, cell cycle analysis, using DNA content,
was not completely consistent in these three cell lines.
DAC was shown to decrease the proportion of cells in
the G0/G1 phase in all three of the leukemia cell lines,
which is consistent with our previous result [29]. DFX
induced G0/G1 phase cell-cycle arrest in SKM-1 and
THP-1 cells but induced S phase cell-cycle arrest in
K562 cells. When used in combination, the effect on
the cell-cycle in SKM-1 and THP-1 cells depended on
the dose of these two drugs. In K562 cells, combination
treatment was additive at all concentrations except at
100 μM DFX and 8 μM DAC where it was synergistic
(P<0.05). Interestingly, 8 μM DAC in combination with
DFX at different concentrations, decreased the proportion
of cells in the G0/G1 phase in THP-1 cells. Treatment
with 8 μM DAC alone for 48 h resulted in 20.14±2.53 %
of cells being in the G0/G1 phase. When combined with
20 μM or 100 μM DFX, the percentages of cells in the
G0/G1 phase decreased to 18.90±2.25% and 10.96±4.92%
respectively. These effects do not appear to be synergistic.
Dae Sik Kim et al. found that treatment with DFX on

its own induced an accumulation of cells in the sub-G1
phase in K562 cells through down-regulation of the
NF-κB expression and β-catenin levels [21]. However,
Ohyashiki et al. demonstrated that DFX induced cell cycle
blockade in the G2-M phase by decreasing the enzyme
activities of ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine
N1-acetyltransferase and by decreasing ornithine
decarboxylase mRNA levels [9, 30] These two published
results are not consistent with each other, and neither are
consistent with our data. We conclude that the effect of
DFX on the cell cycle is complex and may be mediated by
more than one factor, however currently we are unsure as
to which factor is important.
Based on the above results, we believe that DFX
does have an anti-tumor mechanism of action and showed
synergistic effects with DAC in MDS and AML cell lines.
Iron plays a vital role in the normal function of cells.
Increasing evidence indicates the existence of an intimate
link between metabolic status and epigenetic regulation in
cells [12, 31]. For example, the ten-eleven translocation
1-3 (TET 1-3) proteins that catalyze the hydroxylation of
5-methylcytosine to form 5-hydroxymethylcytosine [32],
are members of the superfamily of α-ketoglutarate-nonheme Fe2+-dependent oxygenases [33], thus providing a
direct link between epigenetic regulation mechanisms and
cellular iron metabolism status [12]. In cancer cells, the
balance between iron metabolic status and the epigenetic
regulation mechanisms is profoundly disturbed [12]. For
instance, it is well established that changes in cellular iron
metabolism and dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms
both play crucial roles in the progression of many types
of cancer, such as breast cancer, prostate tumors, and
leukemia [12, 34]. We considered the possibility of
whether a similar process exists in MDS.
Numerous studies have shown that iron plays
a critical role in regulating various important cellular
pathways including the generation of hydroxyl radicals
[35], so DFX and other chelators would be expected to
lower cellular ROS levels by reducing intracellular labile
iron. This has been proven to be correct in many studies
and is considered to be one of the important therapeutic
mechanisms for chelators [7]. In this study, DFX treatment
decreased cellular ROS levels in a dose-dependent
manner in all three leukemia lines, in agreement with
this. In contrast, DAC treatment increased cellular ROS
levels in a dose-dependent manner in all three leukemia
lines. A similar result has been obtained by Fandy et al
[36]. They suggested that the increase in ROS levels
was deoxycytidine kinase-dependent, indicating that
incorporation of DAC into nuclear DNA is required for
ROS generation and that ROS accumulation in response
to DAC was caspase-independent and mediated the
dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential [36].
This effect of DAC may also show up as a comparative
advantage in combination treatment; the ROS level
changed in line with the individual DAC treatment in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the combination group. Therefore, we conclude that the
synergistic effect of DFX and DAC is not achieved by
inhibiting the increase in reactive oxygen species.
Since DAC causes DNA demethylation, which can
regulate gene expression in cis by relaxing chromatin
structure [16], we analyzed the expression levels of five
genes, which have been proven to be hyper-methylated
and down-regulated in MDS [13–15], to identify whether
the comparative advantage of DAC is related to this
mechanism. As expected, these five genes were all upregulated in the three leukemia cells lines when treated
with DAC. In contrast, DFX treatment alone did not
have an obvious effect on the expression levels of these
five genes when compared with DAC treatment alone
(Figure  6). The relative expression of HJV was upregulated significantly in THP-1 cells when they were
treated with 20 μM DFX in combination with 8 μM DAC
and the synergistic effect was very clear (P<0.0001). The
HJV gene, which encodes hemojuvelin, acts as a BMP
(bone morphogenetic protein) co-receptor and triggers
the binding of BMP ligands to BMP receptors to enhance
hepcidin expression, which is the key factor in iron
homeostasis regulation through binding to ferroportin
[37, 38]. Gu et al. concluded that hyper-methylation of the
HJV promoter region could silence gene expression and
that an HJV de-methylating therapy might ameliorate ironoverload in MDS patients [15]. Although it is unknown
whether the synergistic effect on HJV expression is
associated with these mechanisms, we believe that through
this synergistic effect, DFX may play a role in promoting
the demethylation of some genes by DAC.
Our results showed that DFX and DAC both have
anti-proliferative effects in these three leukemia cell lines.
Combination treatment with DFX and DAC showed either
an additive or a synergistic inhibition in vitro, which is
consistent with the previous findings that iron chelation
therapy can increase the survival rate of transfusiondependent low-risk MDS patients suggested by GFM [2].
These data provide a theoretical basis for future clinical
use of iron chelators and epigenetic drugs in MDS therapy
and provide important information that will be useful for
mechanistic studies in clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and cell culture
The iron chelator Deferasirox was kindly donated
by Novartis Pharma (Alcon (China) Ophthalmic Product,
Shanghai, China) and the methylation drug Decitabine
was purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Alorich, Shanghai,
China). Human myeloid leukemia cell lines THP-1
and K562 were obtained from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, and SKM-1 from the Japanese Collection of
Research Bioresources. All cell lines used in this study
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone; GE Healthcare
36527

Oncotarget

Measurement of reactive oxygen species

Life Sciences, Logan UT, USA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scienti c,
Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Following collection, cells were incubated with
DCFH-DA[2’,7’-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate]
(10 μM) in the dark at 37°C for 30 min to detect ROS.
The cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640
and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The ROS
levels were analyzed with BD CFlow® software (BD,
Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,
USA).

Drug treatment
For drug treatment, the cell lines were cultured as
described above in medium supplemented with 20, 50,
or 100 μmol/L DFX or 1, 3, 5, or 8 μmol/L DAC or the
following combinations; 20 μmol/L DFX with 8 μmol/L
DAC, 100 μmol/L DFX with 1 μmol/L DAC, or 100
μmol/L DFX with 8 μmol/L DAC for 24, 48, or 72 hours,
with replacement of medium every 24 hours.

Total RNA isolation and quantitative reverse
transcription PCR

Cell proliferation assay

To evaluate gene expression, total RNA was
extracted using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was
performed on total RNAs obtained from untreated and
treated cell lines. Takara PrimeScriptTM RT Master
Mix (Takara, Japan) was used for the synthesis of cDNA
from cell lines as the first step for reverse transcription.
For qRT-PCR, cDNA samples were amplified using the
Applied BiosystemsViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR System
(Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with Massimo
Massimo Massimo Takara SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM
PCR reagents (Takara, Japan). The expression of ABAT,
APAF-1, FADD, HJV, and SMPD3 genes was analyzed
using the Applied BiosystemsViiA™ 7 software. Gene
expression levels were expressed relative to the expression
of GADPH.

Cell proliferation was measured using the Cell
Counting Kit-8 assay (Dojindo Molecular Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, aliquots (200 μL) of the cell
suspension were dispensed into 96-well plates and
treated with varying doses of each drug. The plates were
incubated in a humidified incubator for 24, 48, 72, 96,
or 120 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Following this, 10 μL of
CCK-8 reagent was added to each row. After incubation
for 4 h, the plates were further incubated until wells with
the maximum absorbance at 450 nm reached values of
approximately 1 optical density (OD). Cell viability was
expressed as a percentage of the control value.

Measurement of apoptotic cells and cell-cycle
distribution by flow cytometry

Statistical analysis

The leukemia cell lines SKM-1, THP-1, and K-562
(1×10 cells/mL) were plated in 12-well plates, and treated
with DFX and/or DAC at different concentrations for
24, 48, or 72 h. The cells were harvested, washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then apoptosis
assessed using Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide (PI)
staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Dojindo Laboratories). Flow cytometry analysis was
immediately performed after the incubation period. Data
acquisition and analysis was performed using a BD FACS
Calibur flow cytometer using FCS Express 3.0 software.
Cells that were Annexin V-positive and PI-negative were
considered to be the early apoptotic fraction, whereas
cells that were double-positive were considered to be the
late apoptotic fraction. For cell cycle analysis, cells were
harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and fixed
with 70% ethanol at −20°C overnight. Prior to analysis,
the fixed cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and
suspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 50 μg/mL PI for
30 min in the dark at 4°C. Cell-cycle distribution was
analyzed on a BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer (BD,
Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,
USA).
