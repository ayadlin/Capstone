BACKGROUND: Arthralgia is common in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS) who are receiving
aromatase inhibitors (AIs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the perceived onset, characteristics, and
risk factors for AI-related arthralgia (AIA). METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey of postmenopausal BCS
who were receiving adjuvant AI therapy at a university-based oncology clinic, patient-reported attribution
of AIs as a cause of joint pain was used as the primary outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analyses
were performed to evaluate risk factors. RESULTS: Among 300 survey respondents, 139 (47%) attributed
AI as a cause of their current arthralgia. Of those patients, 74% recognized the onset of AIA within 3
months of starting medication, and 67% rated joint pain as moderate or severe in the previous 7 days. In
multivariate logistic regression analyses, the time since last menstrual period (LMP) was the only significant
predictor of AIA. Controlling for covariates, the women who had their LMP within 5 years had the highest
probability of reporting AIA (73%), whereas those who had their LMP 10 years previously had the lowest
probability of reporting AIA (35%; adjusted odds radio, 3.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-9.44; P ¼ .02).
Wrists/hands, ankles/feet, elbows, and knees appeared to be associated more strongly with AI-related
symptoms than non-AI–related joint symptoms (all P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: AIA was common, began
within the first 3 months of therapy in most patients, and appeared to be related inversely to the length of
time since cessation of menstrual function. These findings suggest that estrogen withdrawal may play a

cancer. Large, adjuvant, randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) have produced improvements in disease-free survival rates as high as 40%, greater than the rates observed
with tamoxifen.1-4 The utility of AIs also is being investigated in combination with ovarian suppression in premenopausal women with breast cancer and among
healthy postmenopausal women for the prevention of
breast cancer.5
With the increase in AI use and potential indications, AI-related arthralgia is emerging as a major source
of symptom burden among its users,6,7 with a 28% relative increase compared with placebo (21.3% for AI vs
16.6%; P < .001).2 In trials comparing AIs with tamoxifen, the incidence of arthralgia was substantially greater in
AI groups (range, 5%-36%) than in tamoxifen groups
(range, 4%-29%); although the rates varied.8,9 Arthralgia
affected daily function and appeared to decrease adherence, leading to premature discontinuation of AIs.10 One
Canadian chart review of 50 patients indicated that 22%
of patients discontinued adjuvant AI therapy because of
toxicity, including muscle and joint symptoms.11 A study
using a health claims dataset indicated that 1 in 5 AI users
filled <80% of their prescribed AI medications.12
Because of the significant impact of AI-related
arthralgia on quality of life, adherence behavior, and
potential survival benefit derived from AIs, research is
needed to better define the characteristics of AI-related
arthralgia to guide future interventions. Thus, the specific
objectives of the current study were 1) to define the rate of
AI as a cause for arthralgia in early stage breast cancer survivors (BCS) who currently received AIs, 2) to describe
the perceived onset of AI-related arthralgia in relation to
initiating AI therapy, 3) to identify the demographic and
clinical risk factors associated with AI-related arthralgia,
and 4) to explore the joint-specific presentation of AIrelated arthralgia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Population
We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients with
breast cancer who were receiving care at the Rowan Breast
Cancer Center of the Abramson Cancer Center of the
University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, Pa) between
April and October 2007. Potential participants included
3632

all postmenopausal women who had a history of histologically confirmed stage I through III, hormone receptorpositive breast cancer and who currently were taking a
third-generation AI (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane), had completed chemotherapy or radiotherapy at
least 1 month before enrollment, and had the ability to
understand and provide informed consent in English.
Research assistants obtained permission from the treating
oncologist, screened medical records, and approached
potential study participants for enrollment at their regular
follow-up appointments. After informed consent was
obtained, each participant was given a self-administered
survey. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania and the
Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee of the
Abramson Cancer Center.

Outcome Measurement
Primary outcome measures included patient self-report of
joint pain, particularly self-reported joint pain attributed
to AIs; severity of joint pain; and clinical characteristics
(ie, onset, location) of joint pain. Because AI-related
arthralgia is a relatively new clinical phenomenon, we
developed a questionnaire based on limited literature,
clinical expert opinion, and patient input. Then, we
piloted the questionnaire with 16 BCS who were receiving
AIs to determine the clarity of items and patient relevance
and to identify additional content. Because arthralgia in
this population may be multifactorial,13 we instructed
participants to attribute causes for their arthralgia by asking, ‘‘What do you believe are the sources of your current
joint symptoms?’’ The response options included ‘‘prior
osteoarthritis,’’ ‘‘aromatase inhibitors,’’ ‘‘other medical
conditions,’’ ‘‘other medications,’’ and ‘‘others.’’
Respondents were able to choose more than 1 option. To
generate the main outcome variable of AI-related arthralgia, any participant who selected ‘‘aromatase inhibitors’’
as a cause of their current joint symptoms were considered
to have AI-related arthralgia, and those who did not select
that option did not have AI-related arthralgia. This
dichotomous variable was used as the main outcome in
both bivariate and multivariate analyses.
To assess symptom severity, participants were asked
to rate their joint pain over the preceding 7 days on a 5point Likert scale ranging from ‘‘none’’ to ‘‘very severe.’’

To evaluate perceived onset, we asked the participants, ‘‘If
you are experiencing joint symptoms which you think are
related to aromatase inhibitors, when did you first recognize the symptoms after starting to take the medications?’’
Response options ranged from ‘‘right away’’ and ‘‘within
the first week’’ to ‘‘after 6 months.’’ To evaluate which
joints were affected most commonly in those with AIrelated arthralgia, we asked participants 2 questions. The
participant was asked first to indicate all joints with pain
in the preceding 24 hours and then to indicate in which
single joint the participant experienced the most pain in
the preceding 24 hours.
Information on covariates was collected, including
age, race, ethnicity, education level, and employment status. Clinical and treatment characteristics were assessed by
either self-report (ie, timing of the last menstrual period
[LMP], height, weight before breast cancer and current
weight, and comorbidities, including previous arthritis)
or medical record abstraction (ie, stage, chemotherapy,
tamoxifen use, AI use).

Data analysis was performed using STATA 9.0 for Windows (STATA Corporation, College Station, Tex). We
initially performed descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses. Then, we developed multivariate logistic regression
to determine the relative impact of each variable on AIrelated arthralgia. Variables that were not significant at
the .20 level in the bivariate analyses were not included.
To explore how AI-related arthralgia may impact specific
joints differently, we then performed chi-square analyses
to compare individuals with AI-related arthralgia and
those without. Statistical tests were 2-sided, and P values
<.05 indicated significance except in the exploratory analyses for joint-specific arthralgias. Because multiple comparisons were used in the latter analyses, we lowered the
statistical significance to <.01 to indicate significance.

the 300 survey participants, the mean age was 61 years;
and, although the majority of patients (84%) was nonHispanic white, a substantial proportion (13%) was nonHispanic black. In the analysis, we combined the race categories into white and nonwhite. Among the participants,
51 patients (17.6%) reported having had their LMP

example, 26% of those with AI-related arthralgia had pain
rated severe or very severe, whereas only 11% among those
without AI-related arthralgia had pain on that level.
Among those who reported AI-related arthralgia, 67%
rated pain of moderate or greater severity.
Perceived onset of aromatase
inhibitor-related arthralgia

Among the 139 participants who had AI-related
arthralgia, 10 (7%) noticed the onset of arthralgia because
of AI right away after starting the medication, 9 (7%)
noticed the onset within the first week, 46 (34%) noticed
the onset within the remaining first month, 35 (26%)
noticed the onset within the first 3 months, 14
(10%) noticed the onset within the first 6 months, 21
(15%) noticed the onset after the first 6 months, and 4 (3%)

did not provide a response to this question (see Fig. 1).
Thus, about 75% of AI-related arthralgia has been noticed
within the first 3 months after the onset of the therapy.
Factors associated with aromatase
inhibitor-related arthralgia

In bivariate analyses, younger age, full-time employment status, and fewer years since LMP were associated
with greater AI-related arthralgia (see Tables 1, 2). Nevertheless, in the multivariate regression model (adjusting for
variables selected from the bivariate analyses), time since
LMP was the only factor associated with reporting AIrelated arthralgia (Table 3). Women who had their LMP
within the last 5 years were significantly more likely to
report AI-related arthralgia than women who had their
LMP >10 years previously (adjusted OR, 3.39; 95% CI,
3635

Original Article

1.21-9.44; P ¼ .02). Adjusting for covariates, the probabilities of reporting AI-related arthralgia were 0.73 (95%
CI, 0.59-0.84) for LMP within 5 years, 0.48 (95% CI,
0.37-0.58) for LMP between 5 years and 10 years, and
0.35 (95% CI, 0.28-0.44) for LMP >10 years.

FIGURE 1. This chart illustrates the time to onset of aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgia (AI-Arthralgia) in patients
with breast cancer.

Because arthralgia in different joints may have different
underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and differential
impact on function and quality of life, we examined manifestations of AI-related arthralgia in specific joints. The
most common sites of joint pain in individuals who had
AI-related arthralgia were wrist/hand (60.4%), knee
(59.7%), back (54%), ankle/foot (51.8%), and hip
(42.5%), in descending order (see Fig. 2A). The average
number of joints affected in patients with joint pain was
greater in individuals who had AI-related arthralgia

than who did not (3.5 affected joints vs 2.1 affected joints;
P < .001). The worst arthralgia was most commonly in the
knee (22.3%) and the wrist/hand (21%), followed by
the back (16.2%) the ankle/foot (12.3%), and the hip
(11.5%) (see Fig. 2B). Compared with the patients who
did not have AI-related arthralgia, the patients who
reported AI-related arthralgia were significantly more likely
to report arthralgia in the wrist/hand (relative risk [RR],

It is noteworthy that joints distal to the torso may have
greater pain related to AIs (suggested by the increasing
RR).

DISCUSSION
In this article, we present a comprehensive evaluation of
AI-related arthralgia based on patients’ perceptions. Despite the multifactorial nature of arthralgia in a postmenopausal BCS population, close to 50% of our sample
reported experiencing AI-related arthralgia. Most patients
recognized arthralgia within the first 3 months from the
initiation of AIs, and >60% reported current arthralgia
that was moderate or severe. Controlling for clinical and
demographic factors, the time from LMP was related
inversely to the report of AI-related arthralgia, and those
who experienced menopause in the 5 years before enrollment had a 3-fold greater likelihood of developing AICancer

related arthralgia compared with those who were 10
years postmenopause. Furthermore, despite the finding
that multiple joints can be involved, wrists/hands, elbows,
ankles/feet, and knees may be particularly vulnerable to
AI-related arthralgia.
Recent data suggest that the prevalence of AI-related
arthralgia is higher outside of clinical trials.10,14 In a survey among 200 BCS who were receiving AIs, 94 patients
(47%) reported having AI-related arthralgia; and, of those
patients, 50% had a new onset of joint pain after the initiation of AI, and 50% reported that their pain worsened
since starting AIs.15 Our study, like others that have examined this issue in a practice setting outside a clinical trial,
is subject to selection bias. Ten percent of individuals who
stopped AIs were not captured by this survey. Although
our 5% refusal rate was low, it is possible that those
patients who refused to participate were relatively asymptomatic and may have viewed the survey as less relevant.
In addition, because patients with prior arthritic conditions may opt not to initiate AIs, our study may underestimate the degree of AI-related arthralgia in patients with
pre-existing arthritis. Finally, because our study relied on
self-report, some degree of misclassification bias because
of patients’ perception exists; however, for subjective
symptoms like AI-related arthralgia, patient-reported outcome is considered the gold standard. Despite such limitations, our estimated prevalence of ongoing AI-related
arthralgia was almost identical to that of Crew et al, suggesting that the prevalence is credible.15 Furthermore, the
site(s) at which patients reported joint pain also were very
similar to the site(s) reported by Crew et al.15
Our findings with regard to the temporal onset of
symptoms confirm a similar observation in a small case
series,10 and these data justify and inform prospective
studies. Measuring the perceived onset of AI-related
arthralgia may be subject to recall bias, because the actual
event occurred months if not years before the study.
Because most patients reported the onset of AI-related
arthralgia within 3 months from the initiation of AIs,
more intense follow-up and data collection during this
window of opportunity may help evaluate the true timing
of the development of AI-related arthralgia as well as elucidate the potential biologic mechanism. These data also
may suggest that clinicians should have early follow-up
with patients who initiate AIs to discuss the potential
onset of arthralgia, so that timely detection and

management can occur to prevent premature discontinuation,16 which has been documented as high as 20% in
some studies.14,17
Risk factors for AI-arthralgia are not well characterized. In the only other study to report on this issue
in clinical practice, prior tamoxifen use and higher
weight appeared to be associated with a lower risk of
AI-arthralgia, whereas receiving taxane chemotherapy
was associated with increased risk.15 Although these
were not significant risk factors in our population, we
did observed a trend for the use of taxanes (P ¼ .07).
The differences in risk factor profiles between the 2
studies may be the result of sample size or of subtle
underlying differences in the study populations. For
example, our study population was younger, because
most patients were aged <55 years. These findings
emphasize the need to replicate such studies in diverse
populations to determine whether such associations are
robust, reproducible, or population-specific.
In our study, the interval after menopause (measured as the time from LMP) was the only significant
factor that was associated with AI-related arthralgia. We
hypothesize that those individuals who most recently
have transitioned into menopause may have higher residual circulating estrogen; thus, the exposure to AIs
may cause a more precipitous absolute drop in estrogen,
leading to greater symptom experience. Several recent
publications have cited estrogen deprivation caused by
AIs as a potential mechanism for this clinical phenomenon.6,8,9,18 The effect of estrogen withdrawal on the
clinical syndrome of AI-arthralgia may be multifactorial,19 acting both centrally and peripherally.8 Centrally,
acutely reducing estrogen levels may decrease endogenous opioid generation, thereby decreasing pain threshold. Thus, some individuals with subclinical
osteoarthritis may experience a rise in AI-associated
symptoms because of a decreased pain threshold and an
increased awareness of arthralgia, leading some patients
to attribute the ‘‘cause’’ of arthralgia to AIs.20 Peripherally, estrogen withdrawal may up-regulate inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis
factor-a, which may accelerate bone loss and bone
aging, thereby leading to pain.21 Prospectively measuring appropriate biomarkers (eg, reproductive hormones, drug metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines)
in addition to subjective symptom measurement may
3638

help elucidate the biology underlying this unexplained
clinical phenomenon.
Increasing evidence suggests that those women who
may benefit from AI the most also may be the ones who
experience the greatest degree of adverse events. Freedman
et al observed that younger age was a predictor of benefiting from AIs in a cohort study in women who finished
radiation therapy and tamoxifen.22 Cuzick et al recently
demonstrated that those with treatment-emergent joint
and vasomotor symptoms during the first 3 months of AI
therapy were less likely to develop breast cancer recurrence
in a retrospective analysis of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen,
Alone or in Combination trial.23 Our findings underscore
the need to develop mechanistically based treatment
options for these women to adequately address AI-related
arthralgia so that they can adhere to AIs optimally to maximize the benefit of AIs while maintaining quality of life.
Finally, the pattern of joint pain at specific sites provides important data for both clinical care and future
intervention development. Site-specific joint symptoms,
as suggested by the rheumatology literature,24,25 may have
a vastly different impact on functions and quality of life;
therefore treatment and rehabilitation may differ. Jointspecific symptom and function measures need to be tested
in this population to guide further evaluation and treatment development. Some limited self-reported data and
clinical review have suggested that pain medications, supplements, and exercise may be helpful for arthralgia,8,9,15
although these have not been confirmed by well designed
RCTs. Initial research also is underway to evaluate alternative approaches, such as acupuncture, for treating AIrelated arthraligia.26,27
In summary, the current results have shed light on
the early onset and pattern of arthralgia related to AIs and
have identified the interval from menopause as a novel
risk factor for symptom development. Multidisciplinary
translational research is critically needed to evaluate the
etiology and potential therapeutic options for patients
with AI-related arthralgia.
