BACKGROUND: Bortezomib has preclinical and clinical in B-cell lymphomas, both alone and in combination with
other agents. A phase 1 evaluation was conducted of bortezomib with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in patients with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or mantle
cell lymphoma (MCL). METHODS: Twenty patients (16 with DLBCL and 4 with MCL) with a median age of 66 years
(range, 29-84 years) were enrolled. Eleven subjects (55%) had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, and 10
patients (50%) had International Prognostic Index scores of 3 to 5. Standard R-CHOP was administered on a 21-day
cycle for 6 cycles, with 1 of 3 dose levels of bortezomib (0.7 mg/m2 [n ¼ 4 patients], 1.0 mg/m2 [n ¼ 9 patients], or 1.3
mg/m2 [n ¼ 7 patients]) administered on Days 1 and 4 of each cycle. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib with R-CHOP was not reached, and the 1.3-mg/m2 dose level had acceptable tolerability. A dose-limiting toxicity (pulmonary) was only observed in 1 patient receiving 1.0 mg/m2 of bortezomib. Neuropathy occurred in 13
patients (65%), but was mostly grade 1 (45%) and reached grade 3 in only 1 patient (all toxicities were graded using
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0). Grade 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 7
patients (35%). Of 19 evaluable patients, all responded, with 18 (95%) cases of complete response/complete response
unconfirmed achieved and 1 (5%) partial response reported. At a median follow-up of 56 months, overall survival at 4
years was 75% and progression-free survival was 58%. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 twice per
cycle can be added to R-CHOP chemotherapy with acceptable toxicity. Multi-institutional and cooperative group

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is comprised of a diverse group of malignancies with different biologic characteristics and clinical outcomes to therapy.1,2 Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoma subtype, is an aggressive disease that is currently curable in over half of patients.3 However, patients with resistant or recurrent
disease often have unfavorable outcomes. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a heterogeneous disease, with indolent and
aggressive variants, and is generally considered to be incurable with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy.4 The addition of rituximab (R) to the regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) resulted in improved
outcomes in patients with DLBCL and the adoption of chemoimmunotherapy as the current standard of care.5-9
Although initial therapy for newly diagnosed MCL is less standardized, treatment based on R-CHOP is commonly used
for initial treatment.10,11 Although benefits have been noted with the addition of R to CHOP, resistance is common and
more effective strategies are necessary to improve the outcomes of patients with DLBCL and MCL. Incorporation of new
agents capable of targeting relevant biological pathways may lead to improved outcomes.
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib impacts on many cellular processes relevant to the pathogenesis and treatment
of DLBCL and MCL, including accumulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins (eg, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors),

alteration in the balance of bcl-2 family members, accumulation of p53, and inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B
(NF-jB).12,13 The NF-jB pathway is believed to play a
key role in the pathogenesis of the activated B-cell–like
(ABC) subtype of DLBCL, which carries a poor prognosis
compared with germinal center B-cell like (GCB), thereby
providing rationale for the use of bortezomib in these
patients.14-16 In MCL cell lines and patient specimens,
bortezomib induced apoptosis by down-regulating BclXL and bfl/A1 and inducing degradation bcl-2 and inhibition of cyclin D1 expression.16-19
Bortezomib, alone and in combination with R or
dexamethasone, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with
MCL20-26 and is approved in the United States as a single
agent for the treatment of MCL in patients who have
received at least 1 prior therapy. It is interesting to note that
the activity of bortezomib in MCL is independent of responsiveness to prior chemotherapy.27 Although bortezomib
demonstrated minimal efficacy as a single agent in patients
with recurrent and refractory DLBCL, when combined with
dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (DA-EPOCH), no significant
increase in toxicities were noted, suggesting that it could be
safely used in combination with chemotherapy.28
We hypothesized that the addition of bortezomib to
R-CHOP would be well tolerated and effective in patients
with untreated DLBCL and MCL.16 Because of the
potentially overlapping toxicities of individual agents
used in this combination therapy, particularly neuropathy
and cytopenias, we first conducted a phase 1 study using
standard R-CHOP with a dose escalation of bortezomib
in patients with untreated DLBCL and MCL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Patients with histologically confirmed CD20þ DLBCL
or MCL who had not received prior therapy were eligible
for enrollment. Other inclusion criteria included age >18
years; measurable stage II (inappropriate for radiotherapy), III, or IV disease; Karnofsky performance status
50%; absolute granulocyte count 1000 cells/mm3;
platelet count 50,000 cells/mm3; and creatinine and
total bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of normal.
Patients with known central nervous system involvement
by lymphoma or pre-existing peripheral neuropathy >
grade 2 were excluded. The trial was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization
Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Declaration of

Helsinki after approval by the sites’ Institutional Review
Boards. All patients provided written informed consent.
Study Design and Drug Administration
The primary objective was to determine the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity profile of bortezomib
administered in combination with R-CHOP to patients
with untreated DBLCL or MCL. Secondary objectives
included assessment of the overall response (OR) and
complete response (CR) rates, progression-free survival
(PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients received standard, full-dose CHOP chemotherapy comprised of cyclophosphamide at a dose of 750 mg/m2 intravenously (iv)
on Day 1, doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 iv on Day 1,
vincristine at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 iv (not to exceed
2.0 mg total) on Day 1, and prednisone at a dose of
100 mg orally on Days 1 through 5 every 21 days for
6 cycles. R at a dose of 375 mg/m2 with standard premedication (acetaminophen and diphenhydramine) was
administered before CHOP on Day 1 of each cycle. One
of 3 dose levels of bortezomib (0.7 mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2,
and 1.3 mg/m2) was administered on Days 1 and 4 of
each cycle. Day 1 bortezomib was administered before the
R-CHOP. This schedule was chosen to allow for proteosome inhibition at the time of chemotherapy administration. Dose escalation occurred according to the time-toevent continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) as
patients entered the study.29,30 When a new patient was
registered on to study, a vital summary for the currently
enrolled patients was reported to the statistician who estimated the MTD based on currently available observations. The newly enrolled patient was then treated at the
updated MTD.
The MTD was defined as the dose that caused a
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) to occur in 25% of patients
during the first 6 cycles of treatment. A DLT was defined
as a grade 3 motor neuropathy, grade 3 neuropathic pain,
or other grade 4 neurologic toxicity; platelet count
<10,000/mm3 (unless due to underlying bone marrow
involvement by lymphoma); grade 3 or greater nonhematologic or non-neurologic toxicity; or requirement of >2
dose reductions in doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, or
bortezomib, or treatment delays beyond 4 weeks.
Dose modifications for toxicity were allowed. For
neurotoxicity, bortezomib doses were adjusted according
to recommendations in the prescribing information. For
vincristine, doses were reduced by 25% for grade 2 motor
and grade 3 sensory neuropathy. For grade 4 thrombocytopenia (but not <10,000 cells/mm3, which would be

5433

DLT), bortezomib doses were reduced by 25% (to a minimum of 0.7 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin doses were reduced by 20%. Platelet counts were
required to return to 50,000 cells/mm3 before the next
cycle of therapy. Patients unable to be treated by Day 49
(a 4-week delay) were removed from the study and considered to have a DLT. In patients with febrile neutropenia
or an absolute neutrophil count of <500 cells/mm3 for
>7 days, the dose of bortezomib was reduced by 25%,
and cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin doses were
reduced by 20%. Supportive care, including hematopoietic growth factors, antibiotics, and other medications,
could be used at the discretion of the treating physician.
Pretreatment and Safety Assessments
Tumor tissue was collected to confirm the diagnosis and
to test for CD20 expression and other characteristic
phenotypes. Pretreatment assessments included patient
history, physical examination with vital signs and performance status assessment, serum chemistries including
lactate dehydrogenase, and complete blood counts (CBC)
with differential and platelets. These, along with toxicity
assessments, were repeated on Day 1 of each cycle and at
the completion of treatment. CBC with differential and
platelets were repeated on Days 4 and 10 or 11 of each
cycle. All toxicities were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version
3.0).31 Computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck,
chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a bone marrow aspirate
and core needle biopsy were performed at baseline. CT
scan was repeated after the third and sixth cycles of chemotherapy. The bone marrow aspirate and core needle biopsy were repeated after Cycles 3 or 6 if the patient was
otherwise in a CR, and were not repeated once negative.
Patients were evaluated with physical examination, laboratory assessments, and CT scan every 3 months for the
first year and then every 6 months until disease progression or death until Year 5 after treatment.
Response Criteria
Patients were monitored for response using criteria modified from those recommended by the National Cancer
Institute (NCI)-sponsored international working
group.32 Briefly, CR was defined as the complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and related symptoms: all lymph nodes
and lymph node masses regressed to normal (<1.5 cm) or
a >75% decrease in the sum of the products of their greatest transverse diameters (SPD) if between 1.1 and 1.5 cm

5434

at baseline, normalization of serum chemistries, and normal bone marrow evaluation. CR/unconfirmed (CRu)
was defined as meeting the criteria of CR except for a residual lymph node measuring >1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that regressed by >75% in the SPD or
individual lymph nodes that were previously confluent
and regressed by >75% in their SPD, or indeterminate
bone marrow status. A partial response (PR) was defined
as a decrease of >50% in the SPD of the 6 largest lymph
node masses; normal or a decrease in the size of other
lymph nodes, liver, or spleen; and no new sites of disease.
Progressive disease (PD) was defined as a >50% increase
in the SPD from nadir of any previously identified
abnormal lymph node or the appearance of a new lesion.
Stable disease was defined as a response insufficient to
qualify as a PR nor sufficient disease progression to qualify as PD.
Statistical Analyses
For the phase 1 dose escalation of bortezomib, the TITECRM with an empirical dose-toxicity model33 and a linear weight function29 was used with a sample size of 18.
This model is calibrated to eventually select a dose that
results in DLTs in 20% to 30% of patients.30 The TITECRM makes use of each patient’s time-to-toxicity as partial information even before a complete follow-up has
occurred. The sample size of 18 ensures that estimates of
any binary variable will have a 95% confidence interval of
width <0.24.

RESULTS
Patients and Dose Escalation
Twenty patients were enrolled in the phase 1 portion of
the study. Patient and disease characteristics are listed in
Table 1. Four patients received the 0.7-mg/m2 bortezomib dose, 9 patients received the 1.0-mg/m2 bortezomib
dose, and 7 patients received the 1.3-mg/m2 bortezomib
dose on Days 1 and 4 of each cycle.
Treatment-Emergent Toxicities
Seventeen patients (85%) completed all 6 cycles of treatment according to the protocol. Major adverse events are
listed in Table 2. One DLT was reported in a patient with
MCL receiving bortezomib at a dose of 1.0 mg/m2. The
patient was admitted to hospital with dyspnea and found
to have significant bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral
ground glass opacities on CT imaging. Upon further
investigation, the effusions were found to be chylous. The

patients were not fully evaluable for DLT, although toxicity is reported here. One patient receiving the 0.7-mg/m2
bortezomib dose withdrew from the study after 3 cycles of
treatment while in response due to patient preference.
This patient received no further lymphoma therapy and
died of unknown causes 15 months after study entry. One

fevers. The fifth cycle was administered with a 50% dose
reduction of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. One week later, he was admitted to the hospital
with worsening fever and headache. Lumbar puncture
revealed an elevated white blood cell count but no evidence of lymphoma. Molecular studies performed on the
cerebral spinal fluid were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi,
and antibiotics were initiated with rapid resolution of the
symptoms. This infection and related symptoms, including neuropathy (given that the patient lived in an endemic
area) were not judged to be bortezomib therapy. He subsequently received a sixth cycle of treatment with full
doses of cytotoxic chemotherapy but no bortezomib.
Although the protocol specified 6 cycles of therapy, he
received 2 additional cycles due to his treatment modifications. The seventh cycle was administered with a 25%
dose reduction of bortezomib and vincristine due to grade
2 motor and sensory neuropathy, after which his sensory
neuropathy increased to grade 3. He received the eighth
cycle of treatment with no vincristine or bortezomib. One
other patient had a dose reduction of cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, and bortezomib according to protocol for
thrombocytopenia. The prospectively planned highest dose
level to be assessed in the study was bortezomib at a dose of
1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 of each cycle, which was filled
without a DLT being observed.
Myelosuppression was the most common grade 4
toxicity, occurring in 7 (35%) patients, and included
thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 3 patients) and neutropenia
(n ¼ 4 patients) (Table 3). Two episodes of febrile neutropenia were reported. Thirteen patients (65%) reported
neuropathy of any grade. Of these, 9 (45%) had grade 1,
3 (15%) had grade 2, and 1 (5%) had grade 3 neuropathy.

One patient with MCL was not evaluated for response.

The grade 3 neuropathy occurred at the 1.0-mg/m2 bortezomib dose level. There were no incidents of grade 4 neuropathy reported (Table 4). Neuropathy tended to occur
by the third cycle.
Efficacy
At a median follow-up of 56 months (range, 15 to 68þ
months), 11 patients were alive and in remission. The
overall response rate on an intent-to-treat basis was
95%, including 13 CRs (65%), 5 cases of CRu (25%),
and 1 PR (5%), with 1 patient being inevaluable for
response secondary to meningitis resulting from Lyme
disease (Table 5). The 4-year OS and PFS rates for all
patients were 75% and 58% respectively (Fig. 1). The 4year OS rate for patients with DLBCL was 81%.

DISCUSSION
The results of this phase 1, dose escalation study demonstrated that bortezomib at doses up to 1.3 mg/m2 on Days
1 and 4 of a 21-day cycle may be combined with
R-CHOP chemotherapy with acceptable toxicity in
patients with untreated DLBCL or MCL. The combination of R-CHOP and bortezomib was well tolerated and
adverse events were predictable and manageable. Most nota-

5436

bly, there was no apparent increase in either the incidence
or severity of neuropathy or thrombocytopenia, adverse
events most likely given the overlapping toxicities of
the agents used. There was only 1 DLT experienced,
which was a grade 3 pleural effusion. Therefore, the
data from the current study demonstrate that the regimen is appropriate for further study.
The 1.3-mg/m2 dose of bortezomib is predicted to
achieve a maximum inhibition of the 26S proteasome of
65% with return of sufficient proteasome activity by 72
hours.34,35 Theoretically, it is preferable to have the proteasome inhibited at the time of chemotherapy to overcome chemoresistance. However, prolonged proteasome
inhibition is likely to result in increased toxicity. For these
reasons, it is relevant that the 1.3-mg/m2 dose was reached
using the Days 1 and 4 schedule without excessive
toxicity.
Although this phase 1 experience included only 20
patients, R-CHOP plus bortezomib demonstrated
encouraging efficacy, with an overall response rate of 95%
at a median follow-up of 56 months, including 90% confirmed and unconfirmed CRs. Safety and efficacy results
from this study support an ongoing phase 2 trial. Patients
with untreated DLBCL or MCL will receive R-CHOP
plus bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4
of a 21-day cycle with PFS as the primary endpoint. The
subtype of DLBCL (GCB vs non-GCB) will be evaluated
by immunohistochemistry using CD10, bcl-6, and multiple myeloma oncogene-1(MUM1) expression.36 Additional prognostic markers, including FOXP1, cyclin D2,
and bcl-2 will be assessed.15,37 This information may help
determine whether all patients with DLBCL, or only a

subset (ie, the ABC subtype), might derive benefit from
the addition of bortezomib to R-CHOP.
Several studies using the combination of bortezomib
plus chemotherapy have been undertaken or are ongoing.
These trials have met variable degrees of success, with
complications in some cases arising due to overlapping
neurotoxicity from vincristine and bortezomib. In
patients with previously treated DLBCL, bortezomib was
administered on Days 1 and 4 in combination with DAEPOCH.28 In the phase 1 portion of the study, the MTD
of bortezomib was 1.7 mg/m2. However, after multiple
episodes of neuropathy resulting in discontinuation of
bortezomib, the remainder of the phase 2 study was conducted at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2. As hypothesized, the regimen benefited those patients with the ABC subtype to a
greater degree than those patients with the GCB subtype.
In 11 patients with untreated indolent B-cell lymphoma,
bortezomib doses of up to 1.6 mg/m2 were added on
Days 1 and 8 to R-CHOP with vincristine capped at a
dose of 1.5 mg.38 Treatment was well tolerated, with only
1 episode of grade 3 neuropathy reported. The same regimen was administered to 13 patients with aggressive Tcell lymphoma.39 The MTD of bortezomib was not
reached at a dose of 1.6 mg/m2, despite not capping the
dose of vincristine. In a randomized phase 2 study from
the French Adult Lymphoma Study Group (GELA),
Ribrag et al tested 2 schedules of bortezomib that were different from this report in combination with R-CHOP in
patients with B-cell lymphoma: Arm A (Days 1, 4, 8, and
11 at doses of 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2) and Arm B (Days
1 and 8 at doses of 1.3 mg/m2 or 1.6 mg/m2).40 With the
dose of vincristine capped at 2 mg, grade 3 neuropathy
was reported in 5 of 7 patients treated in Arm A at a dose
of 1.3 mg/m2, and 4 of 15 patients treated in Arm B at a
dose of 1.6 mg/m2. The CR rate was slightly higher in the
biweekely group (90% vs 79%). In a feasibility study of
30 patients with mantle cell lymphoma treated with bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone (VcR-CVAD).41 A high
incidence of painful neuropathy resulted with 1.5 mg/m2
of bortezomib on Days 1 and 4 and up to 2 mg of vincristine. Once the doses of bortezomib were capped at 1.3
mg/m2 and vincristine at 1 mg, only 1 of 16 patients experienced grade 3 neuropathy. In a phase 2 study from Canada that was also presented as an abstract, 95 patients with
newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma were treated with
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine (capped at 2
mg), prednisone, and bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 Days 1 and
8).42 Only 6 patients developed grade 3 neurotoxicity,

with no patients developing grade 4 neurotoxicity. Taken
in conjunction, it is challenging to determine from these
data the optimal dose or schedule of bortezomib when
combined with vincristine-containing regimens.
The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) is conducting an ongoing study of R-CHOP þ bortezomib (1.3
mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 of each cycle) with bortezomib
maintenance in patients with untreated MCL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00376961), a regimen identical to that used in the current report. The Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) is evaluating the
VcR-CVAD regimen in patients with untreated MCL
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00433537). Millennium Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of bortezomib,
recently initiated 2 randomized phase 3 trials of R-CHOP
chemotherapy compared with R-CHOP chemotherapy
with bortezomib substituted for vincristine for patients
with untreated MCL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00722137), and R-CHOP versus R-CHOP plus
bortezomib (in the dose and schedule used in the current
study) for patients with non-GCB DLBCL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00931918). These studies will
more definitively assess the potential value of the combination of proteasome inhibition with chemoimmunotherapy in patients with lymphoma.
