Abstract
The progression from preinvasive lesion to invasive carcinoma is a critical step contributing to breast cancer
lethality. We identified downregulation of milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) as a contributor to breast
cancer progression using microarray analysis of laser capture microdissected (LCM) tissues. We first identified
MFG-E8 downregulation in invasive lesions in transgenic mammary tumor models, which were confirmed in
LCM-isolated human invasive ductal carcinomas compared with patient-matched normal tissues. In situ analyses
of MFG-E8 expression in estrogen receptor (ER) positive cases confirmed its downregulation during breast cancer
progression and small inhibitory MFG-E8 RNAs accelerated ERþ breast cancer cell proliferation. MFG-E8 also
decreased in erbB2þ human cancers and erbB2 transgenic mice lacking MFG-E8 showed accelerated tumor
formation. In contrast, MFG-E8 expression was present at high levels in triple-negative (ER, PgR, erbB2) breast
cancers, cell lines, and patient sera. Knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter assays all showed
that p63 regulates MFG-E8 expression, and MFG-E8 knockdowns sensitized triple-negative breast cancers to
cisplatin treatment. Taken together, our results show that MFG-E8 is expressed in triple-negative breast cancers
as a target gene of the p63 pathway, but may serve a suppressive function in ERþ and erbB2þ breast cancers. Its
potential use as a serum biomarker that contributes to the pathogenesis of triple-negative breast cancers urges
continued evaluation of its differential functions. Cancer Res; 71(3); 937–45. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor progression results from accumulation of genetic
changes that permit autonomous growth of malignant cells
(1). While evaluating the genetics of tumor progression, we
identified downregulation of milk fat globule—EGF8 (MFGE8) mRNA in a microarray analysis of invasive murine tumors
(2), but we were puzzled by its original description as a breast
cancer antigen (3). A monoclonal antibody raised against
human mammary epithelial cells was originally used to
demonstrate elevated circulating levels of a 46-kD protein
(BA46) in patients with metastatic breast tumors (4). BA46

radioimmune assays accurately monitored tumor burden and
the a-BA46 antibody slowed tumor growth in xenotransplantation studies (5, 6). However, cDNA cloning of BA46 revealed
that it was the normal breast protein milk fat globule factor 8
(MFG-E8)/lactadherin (7, 8). Importantly, MFG-E8 is the
ligand for avb3-5 integrins (8), which mediates apoptotic cell
phagocytosis (9). Likewise, homozygous MFG-E8 loss impairs
two mammary developmental stages; its loss blocks both
branching morphogenesis (10) and clearance of apoptotic
cells during involution (11). Finally, loss of integrins b3, b5,
or b3b5 accelerates MMTV–erbB2 tumor formation (12).
In contrast, microarray studies have shown that MFG-E8
mRNA increases in a diagnostic gene cluster in basal breast
cancers (13, 14). p63 gene expression is generally restricted to
the basal myoepithelial cell layer of mammary glands and p63/
p73 regulation plays a role in the biology of tumors arising
from these cells (15). Recent developments in our understanding of BRCA1's functions have suggested new therapeutic strategies incorporating platinum chemotherapy and poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for triple-negative
tumors, which encompass the basal subtype distinguished by
its unique gene signature (16). The use of cisplatin as a
targeted therapy is based on findings that BRCA1 defective
cells are particularly susceptible to its effects (17). Studies of
the p53/p63/p73 protein network provided additional support
for this approach. Importantly, both p63 and p73 control of
the p53 apoptosis program is a necessary and sufficient

contributor to the effects of cisplatin. Additionally, a recent
publication identified consensus p53/p63/p73 binding sites in
the MFGE8 promoter, which control transcriptional responses
to p63/p73 in skin (18). Here, we show that MFG-E8 is a
potential biomarker for triple-negative breast cancers due to
its upregulation by p63/p73, which contrasts with its downregulation in ERþ and erbB2þ breast cancers.

Materials and Methods
Animals
MFG-E8 null mice obtained from Barry Shur (Emory University; ref. 19) were crossed with nonmutant MMTV-erbB2
mice (Jackson Labs). Tumor incidence was evaluated by
routine histology or by counting masses in mammary gland
whole mounts at 15 months of age. Conditional p63 knockdowns using p63flox mice are described in Supplementary
Materials. Animal experiments followed approved standards
of the MGH Animal Advisory Committee.

Patient cohorts, laser capture microdissection, RNA
isolation and amplification, microarray analysis, and
qRT-PCR analysis
The patient cohort used for laser capture microdissection
(LCM) specimens was previously described (N ¼ 36; ref. 20).
Additional erbB2þ patients were added (total N ¼ 10). Tumor
samples were used to compare MFG-E8 and p63 mRNA levels
in the basal versus other tumors that were described in
Richardson et al. (13). Unpaired 2-tailed Student's t tests were
used to determine statistical significance of all data unless
otherwise noted.
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization procedures are described in the Supplementary Methods. MFG-E8 expression was scored by an
investigator (D.S.) who was blinded to the estrogen receptor
(ER) status of the tumors and who had not performed the in situ
staining. In situ staining was scored as 0 (no staining), þ (weak
positive), þþ (moderate positive), and þþþ (strong positive).

by an investigator (D.S.) who was blinded to the ER status of the tumors and had not performed the actual in situ staining. Shown is a graph of the fraction of the
tumors staining with various intensities, comparing the ERþ and ER samples. The actual number of tumors staining at each value for each type is shown
within the columns of the graph. In situ staining was scored as 0 (no staining), 1þ (weak positive), 2þ (moderate positive), and 3þ (strong positive).
Comparing specimens staining 2þ or 3þ to those staining 0 or 1þ, one ERþ tumor was among the top 13 MFG-E8-expressing tumors, and one ER tumor
was among the bottom 12 expressing samples. MFG-E8 expression was highly correlated with the ERþ status of breast cancers across all staining intensities
(P < 0.001 by chi-square analysis).

Cell culture, RNAi and cisplatin sensitivity
T47D, MCF7, ZR-75-1, BT474, SKBR3, HCC 1937, MDAMB468, MB231, HCC1143, BT20, and HS578T cells were grown
in conditions indicated by the supplier (ATCC). Secreted
MFG-E8 was measured in culture supernatants 24 hours after
changing media by using the commercial ELISA.
A published lentiviral small inhibitory RNA for p63 (shp63;
ref. 15) was transduced, and total RNA and protein were
harvested 3 days later for MFG-E8 regulatory studies (15).
To study antiproliferative effects of MFG-E8, MFG-E8
(Ambion; ID numbers 1436, 1531, and 1621) and scramble
(Dharmacon D-1205-20) siRNAs were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Ten wells of 96-well plates were
seeded at 6,000 cells per well for each treatment condition for
MTT assays performed 72 hours after transfection. Two hours
after siRNA transfection, RGD blocking peptide (7) or its
control peptide from ENZO Life Science was added to the
cell culture medium to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. For
cisplatin sensitivity the same siRNAs were transfected, cells
were harvested 48 hours after transfection in varying doses of
cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich), and MTT assays were performed as
previously described (15).

MFG-E8 expression decreases during tumor
progression in ERþ and erbB2þ breast cancers but is
increased in triple-negative breast cancers
Comparing mRNA expression changes between invasive
tumors and preinvasive mammary tissues, we initially identified MFG-E8 as a uniformly downregulated gene during tumor
progression in murine transgenic erbB2, ras, and cyclin
D1induced tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 2). An
analysis of available SAGE expression data suggested that
similar changes also occur in human cancers (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). We therefore evaluated MFG-E8 expression changes
in LCM-isolated human specimens where the patient's own
normal and neoplastic tissues could be directly compared (20;
ref. Fig. 1). We found that MFG-E8 mRNA decreased 3.3-fold
from normal to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and from
normal to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in a mixed breast
cancer population (Fig. 1A). This result contrasted with the
original description of MFG-E8 as the breast cancer antigen
BA46 so we next considered whether MFG-E8 changes might
differ among different breast cancer subtypes.
We first found that MFG-E8 decreased 3.9-fold in ERþ DCIS
and 4.8-fold in ERþ IDC samples (Fig. 1B). This was especially
true for cyclin D1þ tumors (Fig. 1C). A similar decrease in
MFG-E8 expression was found in LCM-isolated erbB2þ
tumors during tumor progression from normal to DCIS to
IDC (Fig. 1D). Published microarray data suggested that basal
and BRCA-mutated breast cancers likely had increased MFGE8 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S2), which might explain
the original description of MFG-E8 as a metastasis-associated
tumor marker in this poor prognosis tumor class. We therefore assessed MFG-E8 in these BRCA1 associated and sporadic
basal cancers (13), finding a significant increase in MFG-E8

levels in them compared with ERþ and erbB2þ tumors
(Fig. 1E). In addition, we compared MFG-E8 protein in sera
from 10 controls, 10 ERþ, 10 erbB2þ, and 10 triple-negative
breast cancer patients (Fig. 1F). Control sera contained 318 
96 pg/mL of MFG-E8. MFG-E8 levels increased slightly to 1,700
and 1,730 pg/c in ERþ/PRþ and erbB2þ patient sera, respectively. In contrast, a mean of 3,900 pg/mL of MFG-E8 was
found in sera from triple-negative breast cancer patients. This
increase was due in large part to 4 of the 10 patients whose
MFG-E8 ranged from 3,000 to 50,700 pg/mL, markedly exceeding levels seen in the other tumor types.

In situ hybridization confirms that MFG-E8
downregulation is highly correlated with ERþ breast
cancer
To delineate cell types expressing MFG-E8 and to validate
the results in ERþ breast cancers, we used in situ analyses
using specimens from a separate cohort of breast cancer
patients (Fig. 2, ref. 21). We found high-level expression of
MFG-E8 in an ER-negative breast cancer (Fig. 2A) where a
sense control probe showed no hybridization (Fig. 2B). Moreover normal-appearing breast tissues showed robust MFG-E8
expression, which was decreased in adjacent tumor tissue in

an ERþ breast cancer (Fig. 2C). We confirmed that MFG-E8 is
expressed in both juxta-lumenal and myoepithelial cells in
normal ductal tissues (Fig. 2D), as previously described (10).
We then performed our in situ analyses using 13 randomly
selected ER and 12 ERþ breast cancers to evaluate the
significance of our observations. Characteristic in situ results
for ERþ versus ER tumors are demonstrated in Figure 2E–L.
One ERþ tumor was among the top 13 MFG-E8-expressing
tumors, and one ER tumor was among the bottom 12
expressing samples, showing that low MFG-E8 expression is
highly correlated with the ERþ status of breast cancers
(Fig. 2M, P < 0.001 by chi-square analysis).
p63 regulation of MFG-E8 expression
Abnormalities in p63/p73 regulation are an important
feature of triple-negative (basal) breast cancers (15). Recently,
MFG-E8 was found to be a p63/p73 target gene in skin cells
(18). To determine whether p63/p73 regulatory changes in
triple-negative breast cancer cells might account for their
increased MFG-E8 levels, we compared p63 levels in LCMisolated normal, DCIS, and IDC breast tissues in ERþ, erbB2þ,
and triple-negative cancers (Fig. 3A–C). mRNA for the transcriptionally active (TA) form of p63 (TAp63) increased in
triple negative but decreased in ERþ and erbB2þ cancers.
We next evaluated the effect of conditional loss of p63,
finding that 90% knockdown of p63 in myopithelial cells in
p63flox mice targeted by a K14 Cre recombinase system
decreased mammary MFG-E8 levels by 40% (Fig. 4A). We
then used p63 siRNA to knock its expression down in a
triple-negative breast cell line. The p63 siRNA knockdown
caused a 2.5-fold decrease in MFG-E8 mRNA (Fig. 4B). Using
two triple-negative cell lines, we performed anti-p63 ChIP
experiments, finding that p63 is present in the p63 binding

region in the MFGE8 promoter in triple-negative breast
cancers (Fig. 4C). We compared p63 binding at the MFG-E8
promoter to actin promoter binding as a negative control. As a
positive control, we found that p63 bound to the PUMA
promoter as previously described (not shown; ref. 15).
Finally, we used a previously described luciferase reporter
assay (18) that reports activity at 1,198, 742, 370, and 27
p63 MFG-E8 promoter binding sites in T47D (Fig. 5A) and in
MDA-MB468 cells (Fig. 5B). Reporter activity increased 12.3fold in response to cotransfection with TAp63g at the
upstream site and 5.3-fold at the 877 site in T47D cells.
This changed to 9-fold for TAp63a at the upstream site. p63
cotransfections had similar but lesser effects in MDA-MB468
cells.
MFG-E8 RNAi stimulates ERþ breast cancer cell
proliferation, and MFG-E8 loss accelerates tumor
formation in erbB2 transgenic mice
Since MFG-E8 is the ligand for integrins avb3 and avb5 that
promotes apoptosis (22–24), we evaluated effects of MFG-E8
RNAi on cell proliferation in ERþ breast cancer cells (Fig. 6A
and B). We also compared the effect of the RGD peptide that
blocks integrin–ligand interactions (7) on siMFGE8-induced
cell proliferation. MFG-E8 knockdown increased cell numbers
for ERþ breast cancer cell lines and the RGD peptide blocked
this stimulation.
These data identified potentially antiproliferative effects of
MFG-E8-integrin b3/b5 signaling in ERþ breast cancer cell
lines. Such antiproliferative effects have been shown in vivo for
the integrin b3/b5 receptor by acceleration of tumor formation in transgenic MMTV-erbB2 mice lacking integrins b3
and/or b5 (12). To assess MFG-E8 in vivo, we crossed MFG-E8
knockout mice to erbB2 transgenic mice. Several tumors

Figure 6. MFG-E8 is antiproliferative in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, and its loss accelerates tumor formation in erbB2 transgenic
mice. A, T47D cells were transfected with an siRNA oligonucleotide for MFG-E8 (MFG) or a scrambled control siRNA (Scr), and MFG-E8 and actin levels were
analyzed 48 hours later using standard immunoblots to validate the siRNA. B, three breast cancer cell lines were transfected with scramble and MFG-E8
siRNAs. They were grown for 72 hours in the absence and presence of the RGB peptide that competitively inhibits ligand binding to a and b integrins
and harvested for the MTT assay. The fold difference in proliferation was obtained by dividing the MTT measurement in the MFG-E8 siRNA samples by
the MTT measurement in the scrambled oligonucleotide samples. Plotted are the means and standard deviations for each cell line. C and D, we crossed
MFG-E8 null mice with homozygous MMTV-erbB2 transgenic mice that express the nonmutated form of erbB2 in their mammary tissues. Resulting
MFG-E8þ/ mice were then backcrossed to the MFG-E8/ mice and mice of 4 genotypes were identified using PCR-based genotyping: nontransgenicMFG-E8þ/, erbB2 transgenic-MFG-E8þ/, nontransgenic-MFG-E8/, and erbB2 transgenic-MFG-E8/. Mice were evaluated weekly for palpable masses
and scored as positive upon appearance of a tumor. Shown are photomicrographs of standard hematoxylin and eosin stained tumors that arose in
compound erbB2/MFG-E8/ transgenic mice before 15 months of age (40). The tumors are high-grade invasive ductal carcinomas that display a
predominant solid pattern with focal gland formation. E, at 15 months of age, all remaining mice were sacrificed and mammary gland whole mounts
were prepared. Tumors identified either in the whole mounts or in the mice that developed overt palpable tumors were scored as positive. We plotted
the incidence of tumor formation for each genotype of mice and indicate the tumor number/number of mice evaluated within the bars of the graph.

developed in erbB2þ/MFG-E8 null mice before 1 year of age,
but none developed in either the erbB2/MFG-E8þ/ or mice
that were solely MFG-E8 null (Fig. 6C and D). However, erbB2induced tumor onset was relatively slow in these crosses
compared to the usual kinetics of tumor formation in inbred
erbB2 mice. Consequently, we sacrificed remaining mice at
15 months of age and evaluated tumor formation using whole
mounts to assess tumor incidence at 15 months of age
(Fig. 6E). Tumor incidence caused by the MMTV-nonmutant-erbB2 transgene on its own was lower than published
experiments using inbred strains. However, mice that were
erbB2þ and MFGE8 null developed tumors at 3 to 7 times the
rate seen in mice that were singly erbB2þ or MFG-E8 null
alone.
Triple-negative cell lines have higher levels of MFG-E8
expression and knockdown of MFG-E8 increases
chemosensitivity to cisplatin
We also evaluated MFG-E8 protein levels in 10 breast
cancer cell lines (Fig. 7A top). High levels of MFG-E8 expression were only seen in triple-negative breast cancers. We

measured secreted MFG-E8 levels in culture supernatants,
finding that secreted MFG-E8 matches intracellular expression (Fig. 7A bottom). We evaluated the functional significance of these changes by knocking MFG-E8 down in two
triple-negative breast cancer cells. The MFG-E8 siRNA effectively knocked its protein levels down (Fig. 7B), which led to
increased sensitivity of both triple-negative breast cancer cell
lines to the inhibitory effects of cisplatin (Fig. 7C and D).

Discussion
BA46/MFG-E8 was first identified using an antibody (BA46)
that could monitor metastatic breast cancer burden in patient
samples. Subsequently, MFG-E8/lactadherin physiologic role
was shown in mammary development, complicating the earlier findings. Here, we clarify potentially opposing roles MFGE8 may play in breast cancers of different types. We first show
that MFG-E8 is downregulated in ERþ and erbB2þ breast
cancer (Figs. 1and 2) where MFG-E8 is antiproliferative
(Fig. 6). In contrast, we found that MFG-E8 is expressed at
high levels in the basal/ triple-negative set of breast cancers

immunoblots for a variety of breast cancer cell lines whose ER, PR, and erbB2 status are known. Cell lysates were harvested and Western blots were
performed for MFG-E8. A commercial MFG-E8 ELISA was then used to measure MFG-E8 protein in the supernatants of media from the same cell lines.
Supernatant media were harvested after 24 hours of incubation and ELISAs were performed according to kit instructions. The mean and standard error are
shown for three replicas harvested from each cell line, which are plotted as ng/mL of MFG-E8 in the conditioned media. B, an MFG-E8 immunoblot of
cells transfected using scramble (Sc) and siMFGE8 (MFG) shows effective MFG-E8 knockdown. An actin control is shown. C and D, dose–response curves

where it apparently functions as a functional target gene of the
p63/p73 pathway. We present evidence that p63 directly
regulates MFG-E8 in those cells (Figs. 3–5). These descriptions
of MFG-E8 suggest that its interactions with its avb3,5 receptor
offer new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of different
breast cancer types.
We started by investigating gene regulation during breast
cancer progression. We were surprised to find MFG-E8
decreases in mouse models and in human breast cancers,
given its initial description. This was especially surprising
since we separately found that estradiol induces MFG-E8
and inhibitors of erbB2 downregulate its expression (not
shown). Evidently these effects are secondary to regulation
by p63 given its control of MFG-E8 as shown in Figures 3–5.
Decreases in MFG-E8 that accompany decreased p63 in ERþ
or erbB2þ tumors may provide a selective advantage in these
cancer types to evade immune clearance during tumor progression since MFG-E8 acts as the ligand for the phagocytic
clearance pathway (9).
In contrast, MFG-E8 expression was increased in a different
set of tumors-–the triple-negative subset. These tumors are

the most refractory to treatment, and recent studies are
investigating novel treatment strategies for them. By evaluating microarray databases, a triple-negative–specific association with MFG-E8 expression in breast cancer was readily
apparent. We confirmed this increased expression using cell
lines and in a patient cohort, thus showing that the initial
descriptions of BA46 potentially focused on patients with this
type of tumor. We confirmed reports that p63/p73 regulates
MFG-E8, and we showed this is functionally significant since
an MFG-E8 siRNA increased cisplatin sensitivity. These results
suggest that antagonists of MFG-E8-integrin signaling should
be investigated in triple-negative breast cancers and further
suggest that circulating MFG-E8 levels might be used to
monitor the clinical response of some patients where p63
dysregulation is a major feature of their triple-negative breast
cancer. MFG-E8 levels vastly exceeded those seen in any other
tumor patient in three patients (3,000, 5,000, and 50,000 pg/
mL). While these patients represent only 30% of the triplenegative patients tested, markers such as alpha fetoprotein
and carcinoembryonic antigen are useful when found in
similar proportions of patients with other cancers. One erbB2

tumor patient had a serum level of 3,670 pg/mL. This level
could be due to misclassification, to a mixed tumor phenotype, to co-occurrence of another disease with elevated MFGE8 levels such as systemic lupus erythematosus (25) or to
secretion by inflammatory cells in the tumor itself. Importantly, healthy donors exhibited no MFG-E8 levels higher than
366 pg/mL, again suggesting that further explorations of MFGE8 levels as a serum tumor marker are warranted.
Taken together, our results show that MFG-E8 joins a large
group of ligands with context-specific functions in cancer. For
example, these dual roles are not unlike the dual functions of
transforming growth factor-b. Our results provide additional
evidence that triple-negative breast cancers are phenotypically distinct from other breast cancers and these interactions
suggest that integrins might be a druggable target whose
ligands need to be evaluated in context as integrin-related
therapies are advanced in the clinic.
