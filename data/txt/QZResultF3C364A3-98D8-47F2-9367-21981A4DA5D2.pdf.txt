Abstract
LMO2 is a transcription regulator involved in human T-cell
leukemia, including some occurring in X-SCID gene therapy
trials, and in B-cell lymphomas and prostate cancer. LMO2
functions in transcription complexes via protein-protein
interactions involving two LIM domains and causes a preleukemic T-cell development blockade followed by clonal
tumors. Therefore, LMO2 is necessary but not sufficient for
overt neoplasias, which must undergo additional mutations
before frank malignancy. An open question is the importance
of LMO2 in tumor development as opposed to sustaining
cancer. We have addressed this using a peptide aptamer that
binds to the second LIM domain of the LMO2 protein and
disrupts its function. This specificity is mediated by a
conserved Cys-Cys motif, which is similar to the zinc-binding
LIM domains. The peptide inhibits Lmo2 function in a mouse
T-cell tumor transplantation assay by preventing Lmo2dependent T-cell neoplasia. Lmo2 is, therefore, required for
sustained T-cell tumor growth, in addition to its preleukemic
effect. Interference with LMO2 complexes is a strategy for
controlling LMO2-mediated cancers, and the finger structure
of LMO2 is an explicit focus for drug development. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The molecular cloning of chromosomal translocation junctions
and cDNA copies of genes affected by the chromosomal translocations resulted in the definition of how these abnormal
chromosomes affect tumorigenesis (reviewed in ref. 1). Chromosomal translocations in T-cell acute leukemia (T-ALL) involving
chromosome 11, band p13, resulted in the isolation of LMO2 gene
(2, 3), which belongs to a family of four genes, encoding small LIMonly proteins, in which LMO1 is also involved in chromosomal
translocations in T-ALL (4, 5). LMO1 and LMO2 affect T-ALL by
interfering with T-cell differentiation before the appearance of
overt T-cell neoplasia (6–11). Recently, LMO2 has been further
implicated in T-ALLs arising after retroviral insertion during gene
therapy trials for correcting the X-SCID defect (12–15). Overall,
expression of LMO2 in T-ALL is much greater than simply due to

chromosomal translocations (16, 17) and includes cryptic deletions
of 11p13 (18), but it remains unknown if LMO2 is only required for
development and tumor continuation.
LMO2 is a T-cell oncogenic protein, but its normal role is in
controlling cell fate in normal hematopoiesis, being required for
primitive and definitive hematopoiesis (19–21). In addition, there is
a role for LMO2 in endothelial cell remodeling (22). The LMO2 gene
encodes a 156–amino acid protein, comprising two zinc-binding
LIM domains, each with two LIM fingers. The LIM fingers,
separated by two amino acids, comprises a zinc-binding motif of
either four cysteines or three cysteines plus a histidine or aspartate
residue coordinating the zinc atom and a finger of f16 to 20
residues (represented in Supplementary Fig. S1B). LIM domains
function in protein-protein interactions rather than direct DNA
binding (23–25). LMO2 can bind to TAL1/SCL (another T-ALL
translocation-associated protein), LDB1, and GATA-1 in a DNAbinding complex found in erythroid cells (26). This complex
recognizes a bipartite DNA site, comprising an E box separated
from a GATA site by f12 bp (26). In studies of T-cell tumors
arising in an Lmo2 gain-of-function transgenic mouse model, an
analogous Lmo2-associated complex was detected, but in this case
binds a bipartite sequence comprising tandem E boxes (27). In
addition, other protein interaction partners are known (28),
including the retinoblastoma protein (29).
The frequent expression of LMO2 in T-ALL poses LMO2 protein
as an intriguing therapy target, and its involvement in transcription
complexes provides the focus of applications that can produce a
therapeutic effect. In addition, the protein is expressed in diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, wherein it has prognostic significance (30–
32), and is also found overexpressed in prostate tumors (33).
Whereas protein-protein interactions have been thought to be
‘‘undruggable,’’ this dogma is being questioned (34) by clear
examples of molecules that can indeed induce a therapeutic effect
in preclinical mouse models. In addition, our recent work with
macrodrugs that bind to RAS indicates that interfering with
protein interactions within the cell has a preclinical therapeutic
index (35).
One of the most promising ways that drug design can be focused
on is using structural data to model shapes that can be transmuted
into chemicals. In those cases wherein no structure is available,
antibody fragments or peptide aptamers can serve as guides to
functionally relevant parts of target proteins, wherein small
molecules can have an effect. Therefore, macrodrugs can serve as
lead compounds for rational or in silico design of new small
molecule mimetics. We have found that an antibody fragment in the
single-chain Fv format (VH linked to VL) can block the function of
LMO2 in a mouse tumor model (36) but the size of the single-chain
Fv format surface, which is occupied on the LMO2 target, is too big

LMO2 Is Necessary for T-Cell Neoplasia

to determine the key interaction sites. We have now developed the
peptide aptamer that binds specifically to LMO2 and prevents its
function as a T-cell oncogenic protein in a mouse transplantation
assay. Genetic and in silico modeling shows that the peptide binds
to the fourth LIM finger at the point wherein the zinc atom resides
and exerts its therapeutic effect by interference with the stability of
the second LIM domain. This location is a target for drug design.

Materials and Methods
Screening a peptide aptamer library with LMO2. A truncated form of
LMO2 (amino acids 28–150) was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain in
a modified version of pBTM116, in which the selectable marker for yeast
TRP1 had been replaced by the LEU2 gene, allowing growth in a medium
lacking leucine. This LexA-LMO2 construct was used as a bait to screen 3 
106 transformants from a 20-mer peptide library (37) using the L40 yeast
strain and following the protocol described (38). In this library (cloned in a
vector with TRP1), which contains >109 initial members, the active site loop
of Escherichia coli thioredoxin (TRX) is used as the scaffold to display the
20-mer peptides.
Mammalian two-hybrid assays. TRX peptide and the truncated LMO2
bait (amino acids 28–150) segments were subcloned into the mammalian
pEF-VP16 vector as a fusion with the VP16 activation domain or into the
pM vector (39) as a fusion with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The
interaction between LMO2 and the peptides was tested in Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All luminescence values by
firefly luciferase were normalized against the values by Renilla luciferase.
The best interacting peptide (PA207) was subcloned intact or as
truncated versions in the pM vector, giving the fusion with the Gal4DBD

directly or indirectly through a flexible linker consisting of three repeats of
Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser. The mutated LMO2 preys have been described (36).
Protein purification and surface plasmon resonance. Recombinant
protein expression, purification, and surface plasmon resonance analysis
are described in the Supplementary Data.
Retrovirus infection into Lck-Lmo2 tumor T cells. A PCR fragment
from Gal4DBD-linker-PA207 (Gal4DBD-LPA207, 12-mer) was cloned into
pMIG retroviral vector (40). PlatE viral packaging cells (41) were plated in
six-well plates (106 per well) and transfected with 2 Ag of pMIG-Gal4DBDLPA207 or pMIG empty vector using 8 AL of FUGENE6 reagent (Roche) per
well to produce viral supernatants. Neoplastic T cells prepared from the
thymoma of Lck-Lmo2 transgenic mice (36) were infected as described in
the Supplementary Data.
Transplantation of retrovirally infected cells into Rag1 null
recipients. After retrovirus infections, the percentage of green fluorescent
protein (GFP)–expressing infected cells was assessed using flow cytometry
before transplantation. The mixed population (2  106) were i.v. injected
into Rag1 / mice. Before transplantation, cell viability was measured by
trypan blue exclusion. After the injection procedure, cell viability was again
determined in the residual populations to ensure that injected cells were
still viable. After f6 wk, mice were sacrificed and GFP expression was
analyzed in spleen cells by flow cytometry.
Structural in silico analysis. The LMO2 structural model with and
without bound peptide was created in silico by comparative modeling using
known structures of LIM proteins (42, 43). The detailed in silico modeling
appears in the Supplementary Data.

yeast with an LMO2 bait. The yeast peptide aptamer library
consisted of a diverse set of clones expressing random peptides (20mer) incorporated into the scaffold of bacterial TRX protein as an
external loop. Transformans (3  106) were screened, and 15 were
confirmed to be LMO2-specific binders. These clones were tested
in a mammalian two-hybrid luciferase assay, and 10 showed a
detectable reporter activity for LMO2 (Fig. 1A). The sequences of
the peptides revealed the presence of a motif Cys-X-X-Cys or His-XX-Cys in 12 of the clones (Fig. 1D). The similarity of this peptide
motif to the zinc-binding regions of LMO2 (Supplementary Fig. S1B
online) indicates that the peptides bind to LMO2 at a zinc atom
coordination site.
A conserved region extends a few residues on either of the core
Cys/His-x-x-Cys motif, with generally two hydrophobic residues on
the NH2 terminal side and one hydrophobic residue on the COOH
terminal side of the core motif. Furthermore, a charged amino acid
often occurs as one of the two amino acids between Cys/His and
Cys (Fig. 1D).
The lead anti-LMO2 peptide aptamer binds to the second
LIM domain. The binding site of TRX-PA207 on LMO2 was
assessed using variant forms of LMO2 protein. CHO cells
were cotransfected with plasmids expressing TRX-PA207 fused to
the Gal4DBD (Gal4DBD-TRX-PA207) and LMO2(LIM1 + LIM2),
LMO2(LIM1), or LMO2(LIM2) fused to VP16 (prey) with luciferase
reporter plasmids (Fig. 1B). The luciferase activation with the
LMO2(LIM1 + LIM2) prey and LMO2(LIM2) were stimulated by
25-fold and 160-fold, respectively, whereas the LMO2(LIM1) prey
was inactive showing that TRX-PA207 binds to the second LIM
domain of LMO2 (i.e., LIM2).
We assessed cross-reaction of the PA207 peptide aptamer with
other LIM-only family members and with other zinc-binding
proteins (Fig. 1C). Significant binding was only found with LMO2
and not with the other LIM-only or zinc finger proteins or the LIMbinding protein LDB1. The LIM domain is most closely related to
the DNA-binding domain of the GATA fingers, but no appreciable
binding was found with a GATA1 bait. Finally, the anti-LMO2
peptide aptamer is specific for the LIM fingers, as TRX-PA207

showed no binding to the zinc fingers of estrogen receptor a (zinc
finger type C4) or the protein kinase TTK (zinc finger type C2H2;
Fig. 1C).
We determined if the peptide could bind LMO2 in a semiconstrained form by expressing the peptide linked as a COOH terminal
sequence fused with the Gal4DBD (bait). We used either a protein
comprising Gal4DBD fused with the whole TRX-PA207 (Gal4DBDTRX-PA207; Fig. 2A) with a Gly-Ser flexible linker (Gal4DBD-TRXLPA207) or comprising Gal4DBD fused with just the 20 amino acids
of the PA207 (Gal4DBD-PA207) with preys comprising whole LMO2
(LIM1 + LIM2), the LIM1, or the LIM2 domain only. Both baits
behaved equivalently in luciferase production, indicating binding to
the LIM2 domain–only prey with greatest efficiency. Both fully
constrained (Gal4DBD-TRX-PA207) and semiconstrained
(Gal4DBD-PA207) baits had identical binding to LMO2; thus,
PA207 is able to meet its target site on LMO2 with only NH2
terminal linkage to the DBD carrier.
We assessed the required number of flanking amino acids needed
for the binding by comparing four peptides as baits (Fig. 2B). Highluciferase stimulation was observed with both formulations of bait
with the LIM2 domain prey, and when the linker was present,
the PA207 of 12 or 8 amino acids was able to bind with the prey
[-LPA207 (12 mer) or (8 mer); Fig. 2A]. Conversely, the direct fusion
of Gal4DBD with PA207 resulted in diminished binding for peptide
lengths of 12 or 8. This suggests that steric hindrance prevents the
latter from having access to the LMO2 protein.
The conserved Cys-x-x-Cys motif of the peptide is required
to bind LIM finger 4. Because LIM2 has the greatest binding with
PA207, it suggests that the tertiary structure of LMO2 limits access
to the peptide. Further definition of the PA207 binding on LIM2
domain was achieved with a series of LIM finger mutants with each
side of each LIM finger changed to either the LIM sequences of
ISL1 or LMO4 (36). These preys were coexpressed with the
Gal4DBD-LPA207(12-mer) bait in the two-hybrid assay, and their
relative expression levels were determined (Fig. 3A). The luciferase
analysis showed the most significant effect with the mutant in
which the right side of finger 4 (Fig. 3A) was changed into the

PA207 has an inhibitory effect on Lmo2 in vivo function in erythropoietic
(A and B) and T-cell neoplasia (C ) assays. The ES clones used in the
erythropoietic assay were heterozygous Lmo2 (with a lacZ gene knocked-in
Lmo2 ; ref. 19) designated either Lmo2 +/ ; null Lmo2 ES cells (Lmo2 / ) or
the latter ES cells expressing Gal4DBD-LPA207 (Lmo2 +/ ; Gal4-DBDLPA207). Embryoid bodies (11 d) were used to quantify cells expressing the
endothelial marker CD31 (A ) or the erythroid marker Ter119 (B). C, neoplastic T
cells from Lck-Lmo2 transgenic mice transplant into Rag1 null mice (36). T cells
were transduced with retrovirus expressing GFP only or expressing Gal4DBDLPA207 (12-mer) fusion protein and GFP. The percentage of transduced cells
was determined by flow cytometry before transplantation into Rag1 recipients
(closed boxes ). Recipient mice were sacrificed at signs of ill health, and

(gray boxes ). Error bars, SD of three independent experiments.

LMO4 sequence. In this mutant, no significant binding to PA207
was observed.
Mutations were made at each residue through the ‘‘right-hand’’
side of finger 4 (sequence in Supplementary Fig. S1 online), and the
luciferase stimulation was determined with the Gal4DBD-LPA207
(12-mer) bait (Fig. 3B). Substitution of the Cys125 (involved in zinc
coordination in finger 4) removed PA207 interaction, suggesting
that the peptide aptamer binding site is the zinc-binding Cys-x-xCys motif of the LIM finger 4. Mutation of nonzinc binding finger
4 residues 128 and 130 decreased the reporter activity (Fig. 3B),
whereas mutation of finger 4 residues 135 to 140 significantly
decreased their binding activities to PA207. An important residue
in the LMO2 protein also seems to be phenylalanine (residue 129),
as changing at that position to glycine ablates peptide binding
(Fig. 3B). The amino acids of the PA207 that have key interactions

were similarly assessed by mutagenesis (Fig. 3C). Changing the
cysteine residue 10 of PA207 to aspartate or histidine destroys
binding, as does changing isoleucine (residue 8) to either aspartic
acid or proline (but not the conserve change to leucine).
We have determined the binding affinity of PA207 with LMO2
in vitro using surface plasmon resonance with recombinant
protein (i.e., GST-LMO2 and HIS-TRX-PA207; Supplementary
Fig. S2). Using different concentrations of TRX-PA207 protein, the
average Kd for binding was calculated as 29 nmol/L.
The peptide aptamer inhibits LMO2 protein function. LMO2
is a protein interaction module (26, 27, 44–46) that operates by
protein interaction in each of its functional settings, which includes
hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and leukemogenesis (8, 28, 47). Gene
targeting approaches showed that Lmo2 null ES cells fail to
undergo differentiation into erythroid (Ter119-expressing) cells,
whereas de novo formation of endothelial (CD31-expressing) cells
is unimpeded (21). We used ES cells in which Lmo2 has been
disrupted by knock in of the lacZ gene into one allele (21) to stably
transfect with a plasmid which expressed Gal4DBD-LPA207. We
observed that the PA207 had no effect on CD31-positive cell
development (Fig. 4A), whereas it has an inhibitory effect on
development of Ter119-expressing cells mimicking the Lmo2 / ES

cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the peptide aptamer binds to Lmo2
complexes and prevents specific function.
The effectiveness of the PA207 in LMO2-dependent tumorigenic
models was analyzed using a preclinical mouse transplantation
assay (36). Neoplastic T cells from an Lmo2-dependent transgenic
mouse model were infected with retrovirus expressing the
Gal4DBD-LPA207 and GFP reporter or vector only–expressing
GFP. The proportion of infected cells was assessed using flow
cytometry (Fig. 4C), and these populations were transplanted into
mature lymphocyte-null Rag1 knockout mice. Spleen cells were
collected from mice with splenomegaly, and the proportion of
GFP-expressing cell was determined. A 90% reduction of GFPpositive neoplastic T cells was observed in the recipients that
were transplanted with cells infected with retrovirus encoding
PA207 (Fig. 4C) compared with those only expressing GFP
(vector-only infections). These data are indicative of the specific
growth inhibition of the neoplastic cells by PA207 in vivo in
tumor-bearing mice.
In silico modeling of LMO2 and peptide aptamer binding. To
build a model of the protein-peptide interaction, an in silico model
of LMO2 was generated using mouse Lmo4 and partial mouse
Lmo2 structural data (42, 43). Our in silico model indicates that the

peptide PA207 8-mer (sequence ILCHECVT) has similarities to the
region of the LMO2 LIM2 finger 4 sequence FKCAACQK, which is
itself responsible for binding the fourth zinc atom (residues 120 to
127; Supplementary Fig. S1 online). The most likely position for
the peptide binding site is where the fourth Zn atom is in LMO2
(Fig. 5). The zinc atom of finger 4 seems to be the most exposed
and may explain the interaction of the peptide at this position
rather than the other three zinc atoms. A model was built carrying
the LMO2 point mutation with phenylalanine to glycine in the
codon 129 (F129G), indicating a distortion of the region-binding
zinc. The phenylalanine is exposed to the peptide interaction,
whereas the glycine is buried in the F129G mutant and the zinc
atom of finger 4 is correspondingly less exposed (Supplementary
Fig. S3), providing an in silico explanation for the effect of the
F129G mutation on PA207 interaction with LMO2.

Discussion
LMO2 binding peptides target the zinc binding region of the
LIM2 domain. The LMO2-binding peptides were selected from a
random 20-mer library in the TRX scaffold (37), displayed binding
through a Cys/His-x-x-Cys motif and preferential binding to the
LMO2 LIM2 finger 4. Mutation of the cysteine residues in the
peptide confirms the requirement for these residues (Fig. 3C), but
other residues in the peptide have important interactions with
LMO2, such as isoleucine residue 8 in PA207 (see Fig. 3C).
Our in silico model concurs with mutagenesis data and predicts
that interaction with the peptide has structural consequences for
the second LIM domain without direct changes to the first domain
(Fig. 5). Thus, the mechanism by which the peptide elicits its effect
on the biological role of LMO2 in the T-cell neoplasia assay may be
by disrupting the transcription complex in which LMO2 is a
bridging molecule.
Inhibition of LMO2 function by peptide aptamer. Our data
show that the peptide aptamer (using the Gal4DBD scaffold) can
prevent Lmo2-dependent T-cell neoplasia in a tumor transplant
in vivo assay. This validates both PA207 and LMO2 sequences as
important elements for any possible LMO2-based therapy. In
addition, the PA207 replicates the effect of gene targeting knockout
of Lmo2; thus, PA207 is an ideal reagent for investigating the
normal LMO2 interactome. Cell-specific and temporal activation of
the peptide aptamer would facilitate the dissection of properties of
LMO2 transcription complexes in development.
The T-cell neoplasia transplant assay is a surrogate of T-cell
neoplasia therapy. The results show that transplanted T cells
expressing the PA207 macrodrug are severely growth impaired in
the recipient mice, showing that Lmo2 functional activity is
required for tumor maintenance in this mouse model. This means
that LMO2 is a drug target for therapy of T-ALL and possibly other

neoplasias, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (30, 31) and
prostate cancer (33), wherein aberrant LMO2 expression is
reported. Furthermore, the peptide reported here will act as a
lead for LMO2 drug development.
LMO2 is a validated therapeutic target in T-cell neoplasia.
The Lmo2-dependent T-cell neoplasias that develop in the
transgenic model occur as clonal tumors with long latency,
showing that the Lmo2 transgene is necessary but not sufficient
for cancer. Neoplasia is preceded by an Lmo2-dependent period of
partial blockade of T-cell differentiation at the immature T-cell
stage. As previously argued (48), this blockade of T-cell differentiation coincides with the expression of the Rag recombinase, and
so, in humans, the LMO2 chromosomal translocations will occur at
that stage, resulting in inhibition of differentiation of the afflicted
T cell and eventual appearance of overt cancer. The question of
whether LMO2 is needed only for this preleukemic stage or also for
the overt neoplastic stage is answered by our studies with PA207,
showing overt tumor inhibition by the macrodrug. Thus, LMO2
is a therapeutic target in LMO2-expressing T-cell leukemias and
perhaps also B-cell lymphoma and prostate cancer where LMO2 is
expressed.
Our molecular data locates LIM finger 4 as a key region of LMO2
that could be the focus of small molecule drug development to
ablate the transcription complex. This approach can be tackled by
development of a mimetic compound, either by selection processes
that compete the binding of the LMO2-binding peptide or by
in silico virtual drug screens using either the modeling of the
LMO2-peptide complex or from structures that may be obtained in
the future. The specificity for LMO2 LIM fingers is especially
encouraging for this drug development endeavor and seems to rely
of structural features of the LMO2 protein not shared by the family
members.
