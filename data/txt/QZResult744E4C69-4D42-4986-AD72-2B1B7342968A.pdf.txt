ABSTRACT
Trans-resveratrol suppresses glioblastoma growth in vitro, but its effects on
intracranial glioblastomas remain untested. Resveratrol crosses the blood–brain
barrier, and lumbar puncture (LP) greatly increases its bioavailability in rat brains;
therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of LP-administered resveratrol on
orthotopic rat glioblastomas. Twenty-four tumor-bearing rats were separated into two
groups: Group 1 receiving 100 μl saline containing 0.3% DMSO and Group 2 receiving
100 μl resveratrol (300 μM). Treatments started 3 days after transplantation in 2-day
intervals until death. Intracranial drug availabilities, tumor sizes, average life spans
and the impacts on STAT3 signaling, apoptosis and autophagy rates were evaluated.
MRI imaging revealed that average tumor size in the LP group (495.8 ± 22.3 mm2)
was smaller than the control groups (810.3 ± 56.4 mm2; P<0.05). The mean survival
time in the LP group (22.2 ± 2.1 d) was longer than control animals (16.0 ± 1.8
d; P<0.05). LP resveratrol-treated glioblastomas showed less Cyclin D1 staining,
enhanced autophagy with up-regulated LC3 and Beclin1 expression, and widely
distributed apoptotic foci around tumor capillaries with suppressed STAT3 expression
and nuclear translocation. In conclusion, LP-delivered resveratrol efficiently inhibited
orthotopic rat glioblastoma growth by inactivating STAT3 signaling and enhancing
autophagy and apoptosis.

over 5 years and the others died of recurrence within 15
months [6]. It is therefore in urgent needs to explore
more effective, lesser toxic and the blood–brain barrier/
BBB-permeable anticancer agents in the management of
glioblastomas [7].
Accumulating in vitro data reveal that resveratrol
exerts inhibitory effects on human brain malignancies
including medulloblastoma [7, 8] and glioblastoma cells
[9]. More importantly, resveratrol is able to cross blood
brain barrier [10] and has little toxic effect on normal brain
cells [11], suggesting its potential neurotherapeutic values
in the treatments of GMBs and other neurological diseases.
Nevertheless, resveratrol is quickly metabolized in vivo

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common
primary brain malignancy with extremely poor prognosis
[1]. Surgery is the first stage of treatment of GBMs, while
it can at most remove 99% of GBM mass, leaving 1% of
the tumor cells for adjuvant chemo- and/or radio-therapy
[2]. However, the susceptibility of normal brain tissue to
radiotherapy [3] and the frequent resistance of glioblastoma
cells to conventional anticancer drugs such as temozolomide
(TMZ) are the main therapeutic challenges [4, 5].
Consequently, only 3% of GBM patients with standard-ofcare post-operative radiation and chemotherapy can survive

upon absorption, resulting in very low bioavailability and
limited biological effects in the main organs, especially in
the brain [12]. Due to these reasons, no datum has been
so far available concerning the therapeutic efficacy of
resveratrol for intracranial malignancies. Alternatively, it
would be necessary to explore an administration approach
by which the bioavailability of resveratrol in the brain can
be increased to an effective anti-glioblastoma level.
Lumbar puncture/LP is one of the main
administration routes for treating brain malignancies.
By this approach, the drug concentration in the brain can
reach to a high level with limited dose, within a very short
time and without affecting other tissues and organs. To
overcome the neurotherapeutic dilemma of resveratrol,
we checked the diffusion efficiencies and bioavailabilities
of LP-administered resveratrol in rat brains and found
that high drug availability in the brain (65.662 ± 6.259
μM) could be achieved in this drug delivery manner [13].
Since the concentration of LP-administered resveratrol
is 3 times higher than the intracellular concentration in
rat RG2 glioblastoma cells treated by the effective dose
(150 μM) of resveratrol, it would be possible that lumbar
punctured resveratrol might exert inhibitory effects on the
intracranial tumors. The current study thus aims to address
this issue using a rat orthotopic glioblastoma model
formed by resveratrol-sensitive RG2 cells.

LP of 100 μl 0.3% DMSO-containing normal saline and
Group 2, LP of 100 μl 300 μM resveratrol. The treatments
were conducted according to drug flow diagram of lumbar
puncture and administration schedule (Figure 1).

Sufficient resveratrol availability in brain and
tumor tissues
The amounts of resveratrol in 0.08 g of rat
intracranial glioblastomas and tumor-surrounding brain
tissues were counted at 20 min after LP administration
of trans-resveratrol. As shown in Figure 2, the average
resveratrol concentration was 1.392 ± 0.281 nmol/g in
tumor tissues and 1.037 ± 0.203 nmol/g in the tumorsurrounding ones. HPLC analysis revealed that only one
peak corresponding to trans-resveratrol could be detected
in the tumor extracts.

Resveratrol inhibited tumor growth
MRI imaging (Figure 3A) and histological
examination (inset of Figure 3A) revealed solid
tumor formation 3 d after RG2 inoculation. Treatment
commenced on Day 3 and was performed in 2-day
intervals until animals were sacrificed according to the
study protocol. MRI was employed to monitor tumor
growth and revealed that tumors occupied a great fraction
of the left hemisphere, pressing the brain middle fissure in
the control rats on Day 12 and in resveratrol-treated rats
on Day 17. The force of the solid tumor pressing the brain
middle fissure was more distinct in the control animals
(Figure 3B). MRI monitoring showed that average tumor
size in the resveratrol-treated group (495.8 ± 22.3 mm2)
was smaller than the control group (810.3 ± 56.4 mm2;
P<0.05). As shown in Figure 3C, extensive cell death
with high overall gray intensity (94.7 ± 3.8) was observed
inside the resveratrol-treated tumor tissues compared with
the control group (69.6 ± 9.4).

RESULTS
Establishment of orthotopic glioblastoma model
MRI scanning was performed on the rats after 3 days
of RG2 cell intracranial injection. The images revealed
slightly low signal changes in the left caudate nucleus
region. After enhancing the images with Gd-DTPA, small
solid tumors could be clearly observed in the brains of
all rats with intracranial RG2 cell inoculation. The tumorbearing rats were randomly separated to the Group 1,

Resveratrol prolonged tumor-bearing times

Resveratrol enhanced autophagy

To further evaluate the therapeutic values of
lumbar punctured resveratrol in treating rat orthotopic
glioblastomas, the tumor bearing spans of the two
experimental groups were estimated. As shown in
Figure  4A and 4B, the control tumor-bearing animals
had a mean survival time of 16.0 ± 1.8 days, while the
mean survival time of the rats treated by lumbar punctured
resveratrol was prolonged to 22.2 ± 2.1 days. Statistical
analyses confirm distinct differences of the animal survival
times and survival rates between the two experimental
groups (P<0.05).

Increased autophagy reflects the stress-response
status of drug-treated cells, although its precise biological
consequence has not yet been ascertained [15]. The results
of double immunofluorescence staining demonstrated
that the autophagy-related protein LC3 was undetectable
in glioblastoma tissues from the control group but was
distinct in resveratrol-treated tumor tissues; Beclin1
was expressed in control tumor tissues and upregulated
following resveratrol treatment (Figure 6A). The
results of western blotting were in accordance with the
immunofluorescence findings, showing elevated Beclin1
and the appearance of LC3 expression with remarkable
LC3 II generation in the tumors treated with LP resveratrol
(Figure 6B; P<0.05). Beclin1 was expressed but LC3 was
undetectable in normal brain tissue.

Unique location of apoptotic foci in resveratroltreated tumor tissues
Because resveratrol suppresses the in vitro growth
of RG2 glioblastoma cells and causes apoptosis [14],
its corresponding effects on RG2 orthotopic tumors
were evaluated. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining
demonstrated extensive cell death (Figure 5A). TUNEL
assay revealed that apoptotic foci were widely distributed
in the tumor tissues, especially at regions surrounding
capillaries (Figure 5B and 5C; P<0.05). In contrast,
cell death was uncommon in tumors from the control
group. Immunohistochemical staining showed decreased
frequencies of Cyclin D1 labeling cells in tumors treated
with resveratrol (Figure 5B and 5C; P<0.05).

Resveratrol inactivated STAT3 signaling
ImmunohistochemistryforSTAT3 was performed
on tissue microarrays constructed with the brain tumors
and surrounding tissues of the animals with and without
resveratrol treatment. Staining showed that STAT3 and
p-STAT3 were undetectable in normal brain tissues,
expressed at a high level in untreated glioblastoma
tissues and remarkably decreased in resveratrol-treated
tumors, particularly in the regions with extensive cell
death (Figure 6A). Western blotting (Figure 6B) further

demonstrated the reduction of STAT3 and p-STAT3 levels
in tumors treated with LP resveratrol (P<0.05).

LP administration can remarkably increase intracranial
resveratrol concentrations [13]. However, it is still
unclear whether the growth of intracranial tumors can be
controlled and the survival times of glioblastoma-bearing
rats can be prolonged by LP-delivered resveratrol. To
address these issues, an orthotopic rat glioblastoma model
was established using RG2 glioblastoma cells [20]. MRI
images showed that although the intracranial tumors
grew irrespective of LP resveratrol treatment, the speed
of tumor growth and average tumor size were reduced

DISCUSSION
The main challenges in glioblastoma treatment
are the severe side effects of commonly used anticancer
drugs and primary and secondary drug resistance [16, 17].
Trans-resveratrol possesses anti-glioblastoma activity
without affecting normal brain cells [12, 18, 19] and

death [20]. However, corroborating data from in vivo
systems have not yet been available. Our morphological
examination revealed that untreated tumor tissues
showed aggressive growth and abundant Cyclin
D1 expression, while TUNEL+ apoptosis foci were
commonly observed in resveratrol-treated tumor tissues,
which also showed a remarkable reduction of Cyclin
D1 expression. The heterogeneous gray intensity inside
the MRI-imaged resveratrol-treated tumors further
supports these findings. Interestingly, those foci were
commonly located in the regions close to or surrounding
capillaries. Glioblastomas are highly vascularized
[25], which may increase the diffusion efficiency of
LP resveratrol from tumor capillaries, allowing it to
directly act on neighboring tissues. Meanwhile, the brainassociated UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A6, 2B7 and
8, which metabolize trans-resveratrol to the less potent
monoglucuronide are down-regulated in RG2 cells [14].
Consequently, the enhanced angiogenesis and reduced biotransforming activities may increase the bioavailability
and anticancer effects of trans-resveratrol in RG2-derived
tumors. The above findings provide direct evidence for

in resveratrol-treated rats, which significantly prolonged
mean survival time. The observed inhibition of tumor
growth and the prolonged survival times result from LPdelivered resveratrol rather than the cytotoxic effects of
0.3% DMSO because 1) control rats were treated with
the same concentration of DMSO (0.3%) in normal saline
via lumbar puncture and 2) the amount of resveratrol in
the brain tumor tissues was higher than in resveratrolsuppressed RG2 cells [13]. Nevertheless, tumor-bearing
rats receiving LP resveratrol treatments eventually died
from tumor expansion, suggesting the insufficiency of
this therapeutic approach by itself to cure orthotopic
glioblastomas. In clinical settings, surgery is the first-line
treatment for glioblastomas [21], while chemotherapy is
used pre-operatively to improve resection rates [22] and/
or post-operatively to prevent recurrence [23, 24]. In this
context, a combination of LP-administered resveratrol
with surgery may improve the therapeutic outcome of the
individual treatments, and we are currently testing this
hypothesis using the same experimental model.
Resveratrol manifests its anticancer effects by
suppressing proliferation and causing extensive cell

the effectiveness of LP resveratrol in inhibiting orthotopic
glioblastoma growth.
Autophagy rates reflect cellular responses to
environmental stresses such as drug treatment [26, 27].
So far, no report has been available concerning the status
of autophagy and its relevance to resveratrol sensitivity
in glioblastoma cells either in vitro or in vivo. We found
that resveratrol promoted expression of the autophagyrelated protein Beclin1 and, especially, LC3 in tumor
tissues. Interestingly, the cells with Beclin1 and LC3 colabeling also accumulated in regions close to capillaries,
overlapping with the regions of high apoptosis. This
finding indicates a potential link between enhanced
autophagy and apoptotic cell death and suggests that
these two biological events underlie the in vivo effects of
resveratrol on glioblastomas.
STAT3 signaling is critical for glioblastoma cells
[28] and is the major molecular target of resveratrol [29].
Because STAT3 signaling is activated in RG2 cells, its
status in resveratrol-treated tumors was also evaluated.
The results revealed that activated STAT3 signaling was
suppressed by resveratrol; overall STAT-3 expression was
down-regulated as was p-STAT3 nuclear translocation.
Interestingly, STAT3 signaling was unevenly inactivated
in the tumor tissues, and regions showing STAT3
inhibition exhibited extensive cell death. The roles of
STAT3 signaling in suppressing apoptosis and autophagy
in cancer cells have been well documented [30, 31]. For
this reason, the cell death in those regions may be, at least
in part, the biological consequence of resveratrol-mediated
STAT3 inactivation.
Taken together, our imaging, pathological and
mechanistical examinations confirm the inhibitory
effects of LP-administered resveratrol on orthotopic
rat glioblastomas, indicating the potential values of this
therapeutic approach in the clinical treatment of brain
malignancies. The sporadic distribution of STAT3inactivated apoptotic foci in tumor tissues and the eventual
death of resveratrol-treated tumor-bearing animals suggest
the necessity to combine LP resveratrol with surgical
resection for more promising therapeutic outcomes.
Employment of improved drug delivery systems such as
biodegradable nanocapsules [32] may further enhance the
efficacy of resveratrol.

LP with 100 μl of 0.3% DMSO-containing normal saline
(12 rats) and Group 2 received LP with 100 μl of 300 μM
resveratrol (12 rats). Because the total cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) volume present in the rat central nervous system is
about 500 μl [34], the final resveratrol concentration in the
CSF was approximately 50 μM. LP was conducted into
the L5-6 interspace in two-day intervals using previously
described methods [13] and lasted until animal death
(Figure 1).

MRI monitoring of tumor growth
Animals were imaged at the MRI Facility of the
Department of Radiology, the Second Clinical College,
Dalian Medical University, using a 7-Tesla/30 cm horizontal
bore magnet (SIEMENS Verio 3.0 T, Munich, Germany) 3
days after RG2 cell inoculation. Animals were anesthetized
with 10% chloral hydrate (0.3 ml/100 g) by intraperitoneal
injection, and then placed in an MR probe head in the
prone position. A head surface coil was used for receiving
the induced MR signal. A quadrature volume coil (72-mm
inner diameter) was used to transmit radiofrequency pulses
(Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH). Check Sequence: T1WI,
T2WI; Specific imaging parameters are as follows: whole
brain axial scans. T1WI: SE sequence, layer thickness: 3
mm, interlayer spacing: 0.3 mm, FOV: 60 × 60 mm, matrix:

T2WI: TSE sequence, layer thickness: 3 mm, interlayer
spacing: 0.3 mm, FOV: 60 × 60 mm, matrix: 288 × 384,

TSE sequence, layer thickness: 3 mm, interlayer spacing:
0.3 mm, FOV; 144 × 144 mm, matrix: 130 × 130, 8NEX
TR/TE = 7082 ms/90 ms, imaging time: 249 s. The contrast
agent (Gd-DTPA, 0.3 mmol/kg) was injected through tail
veins for enhanced imaging [3, 35].

Tumor area measurements
For accurate tumor area measurements, digital
MRI images of the intracranial tumors were saved in JPG
form and opened at Adobe Photoshop CS4 site (Adobe
Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA, USA). As shown in
Figure 3C, tumor margins were defined using the “Magic
Wand” tool. Pixel values from individual tumors were
calculated using previously described methods [36]. A 1
mm2 standard area unit was set in the original films/MRI
images and its pixel value was defined as the numerator.
The areas of all tumors were calculated simultaneously
by dividing each of the tumor pixel values (Y) in the
excel form with the pixel value of standard area unit (X)
and then multiplied by the real area of the standard unit
(Z). Calculations were conducted by three independent
researchers, and the data obtained were analyzed together
by the independent-samples t-test method with SSPS 17.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance
was defined as P<0.05.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Resveratrol delivery via lumbar puncture
A 100-mM stock solution of resveratrol (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was made by dissolving
0.228 g in 10 ml dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; SigmaAldrich). The 300 μM working solution was prepared by
mixing 3 μl of the stock solution with 1 ml physiological
saline just before use. The tumor-bearing rats were

the main molecular target of resveratrol and the critical
survival and growth-promoting factor of glioblastoma
cells [40, 41], its status in the orthotopic glioblastoma
tissues with and without LP resveratrol treatment was
analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and western
blotting using rabbit anti-STAT3 antibody (1:300 for
immunohistochemistry and 1:1000 for western blotting;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
and anti-phosphorylated STAT3 antibody (1:300 for
immunohistochemistry and 1:600 for western blotting;
ProteinTech, Chicago, IL, USA) [41]. Binding of the
primary antibody was detected by a peroxidase reaction
using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) as
the substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Tissue sections without primary antibody incubation were
used as background controls for IHC staining and β-actin
was used as a quantitative control for western blotting.

Tumor-bearing animals that suffered from rapid
weight-loss, lack of appetite and/or paralysis were
painlessly sacrificed in a cold room (4°C) by an authorized
expert in the DMU Animal Center through cervical
dislocation, and whole brains were harvested within 3
minutes. All animal experiments were performed under
chloral hydrate anesthesia and all efforts were made to
minimize animal suffering. By the end of the experiments,
the animals were scarified by the experts in the University
Animal Center. Portions of the tumor-containing tissues
were snap frozen with evaporated liquid nitrogen
(–80°C) for frozen sectioning and protein preparation,
and the remaining tissue was fixed in 10% formalin,
embedded into paraffin and sectioned for morphological
and immunohistochemical examinations using standard
methods [37].

LC3 and Beclin1 double immunofluorescence
labeling

Resveratrol availability in brain
All experiments were performed 20 min following
LP administration. Briefly, brains were dissected on an
ice bed, wrapped in aluminum foil, snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at –80°C until use. Tumor-bearing
and cancer-free brain tissues in the frozen sections were
separately collected using standard procedures [13] and
used for HPLC analysis. Sample tissues were extracted
with 416 μl methanol and 84 μl internal standard (IS, 1,
8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, 200 μg/ml) in a centrifuge
tube. The tissue homogenates were vortexed for 5 min
and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The
supernatant was then transferred to a clean tube. The
residue was extracted twice more with 1 ml methanol
by vigorous 5 min agitation, followed by centrifugation.
The combined organic solvent of the supernatants was
evaporated to a final volume of 400 μl, and subsequently
placed in a sealed amber vial for HPLC analysis [11]. To
improve the sensitivity and precision of quantification, we
purified the samples and cited 1, 8-dihydroxyanthraquinone
(Sigma-Aldrich) as the internal standard and transresveratrol (Sigma-Aldrich) as the standard for drawing a
standard curve using previously described methods [13].

LC3 and Beclin1 double immunofluorescence
labeling was performed on tumor tissues obtained from
the two experimental groups. The tumor tissues were
rinsed with PBS, and then fixed in cold acetone for 20 min
and stored at –20°C. After being blocked with 10% goat
serum in PBS for 20 min, tumor tissues were incubated
overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-LC3 antibody (1:80;
GeneTex Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) and rabbit anti-Beclin1
antibody (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), followed by
co-incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG and PE-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (both 1:100;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 37°C for 60 min in the dark.
Nuclei were labeled with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole,
2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamidine. After
being sealed with fluorescence mounting medium,
the tumor tissues were observed and imaged under a
fluorescence microscope (BX53F, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
The same anti-LC3 and anti-Beclin1 antibodies were
used for western blotting at dilutions of 1:200 and 1:600,
respectively.
