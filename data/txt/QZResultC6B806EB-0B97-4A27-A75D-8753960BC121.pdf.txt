Abstract
Using the intratumoral aromatase xenograft model, we have
observed that despite long-lasting growth inhibition, tumors
eventually begin to grow during continued letrozole treatment. In cells isolated from these long-term letrozole-treated
tumors (LTLT-Ca), estrogen receptor-A (ERA) levels were
decreased, whereas signaling proteins in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade were up-regulated along with
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2). In the
current study, we evaluated the effect of discontinuing
letrozole treatment on the growth of letrozole-resistant cells
and tumors. The cells formed tumors equally well in the
absence or presence of letrozole and had similar growth rates.
After treatment was discontinued for 6 weeks, letrozole was
administered again. Marked tumor regression was observed
with this second course of letrozole treatment. Similarly, in
MCF-7Ca xenografts, a 6-week break in letrozole treatment
prolonged the responsiveness of the tumors to letrozole. To
understand the mechanisms of this effect, LTLT-Ca cells were
cultured in the absence of letrozole for 16 weeks. The resulting
cell line (RLT-Ca) exhibited properties similar to MCF-7Ca
cells. The cell growth was inhibited by letrozole and
stimulated by estradiol. The expression of phosphorylated
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was reduced and
ERA and aromatase levels increased compared with LTLT-Ca
cells and were similar to levels in MCF-7Ca cells. These results
indicate that discontinuing treatment can reverse letrozole
resistance. This could be a beneficial strategy to prolong
responsiveness to aromatase inhibitors for patients with
breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4518–24]

Introduction
Approximately 75% of patients with breast cancer have
hormone-dependent tumor cells and are given endocrine therapy.
Aromatase inhibitors are proving to be more effective than the
antiestrogen tamoxifen. Nevertheless, as with all forms of cancer
therapy, not all patients respond and some relapse due to the
development of resistance to aromatase inhibitor treatment.
To study hormone-responsive breast cancer, we created a model
system in which tumors of human estrogen receptor (ER)–positive
breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene
(MCF-7Ca) were grown in immunosuppressed ovariectomized

mice (1, 2). This model system has provided us with results (3)
that have predicted the outcomes of several clinical trials (4–7). We
have previously reported that during treatment with letrozole, the
MCF-7Ca xenografts increased the expression of human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2) and proteins in the downstream
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In order to
investigate the mechanisms in the loss of sensitivity of the tumors
to aromatase inhibitors, we developed a cell line isolated from
tumors of MCF-7Ca cells following long-term letrozole treatment
(8, 9). These cells also exhibited a lower expression of ERa and an
increase in Her-2 as well as apparent ‘‘estradiol-independent’’
growth (8). In our previous studies, we found that inhibition of
these growth factor pathways leads to down-regulation of Her-2/
MAPK activation and restoration of ERa-mediated signaling,
suggesting that signaling pathways such as Her-2/MAPK are the
key regulators of growth of letrozole-refractory cells and tumors.
Furthermore, trastuzumab, an inhibitor of the Her-2 pathway,
reverses the resistance of long-term letrozole-treated tumor (LTLTCa) cells to letrozole (10). This suggests that cross-talk between the
Her-2/MAPK and ERa pathways control the growth of cancer cells.
In this study, we evaluated the effect of discontinuing letrozole
treatment on these signaling pathways and whether hormone
sensitivity could be restored in LTLT-Ca cells and tumors.
Treatment with letrozole shifted the balance towards the growth
factor pathway whereas when the treatment is stopped, compensatory signaling via the Her-2/MAPK pathway declined, ERa levels
were restored, and the cells regained their original sensitivity to
letrozole.

Materials and Methods
Materials. DMEM, IMEM, penicillin/streptomycin solution (10,000 IU
each), 0.25% trypsin–1 mmol/L EDTA solution, Dulbecco’s PBS, and
geneticin (G418) were obtained from Invitrogen. Androstenedione was
obtained from Sigma Chemical Company.
Cell culture. MCF-7Ca cells were routinely cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
and 700 Ag/mL of G418. LTLT-Ca cells were isolated from the tumors of mice
treated with letrozole for 56 weeks as previously described (8). In brief,
small pieces of tumors were disrupted by repeatedly drawing into a pipette.
The tissue was incubated at 37jC, stirring overnight with collagenase type
1A, hyalyronidase type 1S, amphotericin B, and polymixin B sulfate. The
cells were filtered and plated onto Petri dishes. After a week, phenol red–
free trypsin was added to remove fibroblasts and washed with Dulbecco’s
PBS. Epithelial cells were cultured in medium with 750 Ag/mL of G418 and
1 Amol/L of letrozole. Over the next 2 to 3 weeks, serum levels in the
medium were reduced to 5% charcoal-stripped serum and penicillin/
streptomycin levels were reduced to 1%. The cells were then propagated in
phenol red–free IMEM supplemented with 5% CSS, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, 750 Ag/mL of G418, and 1 Amol/L of letrozole. RLT-Ca cells
were derived by culturing LTLT-Ca cells supplemented with androstenedione and in the absence of letrozole for at least 4 months.
Cell proliferation assays were performed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described

Letrozole Resistance is Reversed by Stopping the Treatment

Figure 1. A, effect of letrozole on the proliferation of MCF-7Ca, LTLT-Ca, and RLT-Ca cells in vitro: the viability of cells was measured by MTT assay after 6 d of treatment
with letrozole as described in the Materials and Methods. The treatment with letrozole was significantly more effective in MCF-7Ca and RLT-Ca cells compared with
LTLT-Ca cells (P = 0.0003). B, aromatase activity of MCF-7Ca, LTLT-Ca, and RLT-Ca cells: aromatase activity was measured by 3H2O release assay as described in

earlier (8, 11). The results were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance
of the controls. IC50 values for inhibitors were calculated from the nonlinear
regression line of the plot of cell viability (percentage of control) versus
inhibitor concentration.
Tumor growth in ovariectomized female athymic nude mice. All
animal studies were performed according to the guidelines and approval of
the Animal Care Committee of the University of Maryland School of
Medicine. Female ovariectomized athymic nude mice, 4 to 6 weeks of age,
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). The
mice were housed in a pathogen-free environment under controlled
conditions of light and humidity and received food and water ad libitum.
The tumor xenografts of MCF-7Ca cells were grown in mice as previously
described (3, 9). Mice were assigned to groups for treatment so that there
was no statistically significant difference in tumor volume among the
groups at the beginning of treatment (P = 0.97). Tumors were measured
weekly with calipers and volumes were calculated using the formula (4/3) p
r21 r 2 (r 1 V r 2). The doses of letrozole and androstenedione used were
previously determined and reported. Mice in the androstenedione group
(n = 6) were treated for 7 weeks, after which they were sacrificed due to
large tumor volumes. The mice in the letrozole group (n = 30) continued
to receive treatment. When the tumor volumes of these mice reached
double their starting size, the mice were assigned into two groups. One
group (n = 10) stayed on continued letrozole treatment and the other group
received only androstenedione (n = 20). This group was assigned as ‘‘off
letrozole.’’ Out of these 20 mice, 10 mice were switched back to letrozole
after 6 weeks of discontinuation of treatment. This group was designated
‘‘back on.’’
LTLT-Ca xenografts were grown similarly as the MCF-7Ca xenografts (8).
However, after inoculating LTLT-Ca cells into the mice, they were not
supplemented with any steroidal agent. After 4 months off treatment, the
mice were grouped so that there was no statistically significant difference in
their tumor volumes (P = 0.56).
Western blotting. The protein extracts from tumor tissues were
prepared by homogenizing the tissue in ice-cold Dulbecco’s PBS containing
protease inhibitors, and lysates from cells were prepared as described
previously and separated by SDS-PAGE (11).

H2O release assay for aromatase activity measurement. The
radiometric 3H2O release assay was performed as described previously

(12). The activity of the enzyme was corrected for protein concentration in
the tumor homogenates and cells.
Statistics. The tumor volumes were analyzed with S-PLUS (7.0, Insightful
Corp.) to estimate and compare an exponential variable (bi) controlling the
growth rate for each treatment groups as described previously (13). P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
Antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors produce inhibitory
effects and estradiol induces mitogenic effects on RLT-Ca cells.
LTLT-Ca cells were cultured without letrozole for 4 months. These
cells were designated as RLT-Ca cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the IC50
of letrozole was 44.3 pmol/L in the parental MCF-7Ca cells and
1.85 nmol/L in RLT-Ca cells, whereas LTLT-Ca cells were resistant

to the growth-inhibitory effects of letrozole. Similar effects were
observed with other aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, exemestane
and antiestrogen fulvestrant, and tamoxifen. The IC50 values of
these agents in RLT-Ca cells are comparable to the parental MCF7Ca cells (Table 1). However, tamoxifen was found to be the least
effective compound of all studied (IC50 > 19.8 Amol/L). Our findings
indicate that when letrozole-resistant cells (LTLT-Ca) are no longer
exposed to letrozole for several weeks (RLT-Ca), they regain their
original sensitivity to aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens,
whereas LTLT-Ca cells exhibit complete cross-resistance to all
endocrine agents (data not shown). The reversal of response to
letrozole was accompanied by increased aromatase activity in RLTCa cells (Fig. 1B) compared with LTLT-Ca cells (P < 0.01), which
was also higher than the activity in MCF-7Ca cells (P < 0.05).
In addition, RLT-Ca cells respond to the mitogenic effects of
androstenedione and estradiol. Figure 2A shows that androstenedione stimulated the growth of RLT-Ca cells at concentrations of
10 11 and 10 9 mol/L (P < 0.01), a response similar to that of MCF7Ca cells. Interestingly, the growth of LTLT-Ca cells was decreased
at all androstenedione concentrations (Fig. 2A). This effect may be

due to a specific androgenic effect of androstenedione as it was
not converted to estrogen owing to the low levels of aromatase
activity in LTLT-Ca cells (Fig. 1B; ref. 14). Estradiol was ineffective
in stimulating the growth of LTLT-Ca cells, as shown in Fig. 2B.
However, the growth of RLT-Ca cells was significantly stimulated
by estradiol at concentrations of 10 12 to 10 10 mol/L (P < 0.01).
The biphasic dose-response of androstenedione and estradiol
observed in RLT-Ca cells is similar to the response of MCF-7Ca
cells. RLT-Ca cells show changes in the activation and expression
of several signal transduction proteins. Thus, compared with LTLTCa cells, Her-2 and phosphorylated MAPK levels were decreased,
whereas ERa increased to levels approaching those of MCF-7Ca
cells (Fig. 2C).
Reversal of letrozole resistance in LTLT-Ca xenografts. As
shown in Fig. 3A, when LTLT-Ca xenografts were grown in nude
mice in the absence of letrozole for a period of 4 months, they
responded to a second course of letrozole treatment for up to
12 weeks. The growth rate (bi) of tumors treated with letrozole
(6.5 F 7.1) was significantly (P = 0.04) lower compared with control
tumors (48.8 F 16.8). The mean tumor volume of letrozole-treated

described in Materials and Methods. Compared with LTLT-Ca cells, RLT-Ca cells exhibit a significantly marked stimulation of proliferation in response to
androstenedione at concentrations of 10 11 mol/L and 10 10 mol/L (*, P < 0.001). LTLT-Ca cells are markedly inhibited by androstenedione at all concentrations
(b, P < 0.01), but only at a concentration of 10 6 mol/L of androstenedione in RLT-Ca cells (c, P < 0.05) and 10 5 mol/L and 10 4 mol/L (*, P < 0.001). B, effect of
estradiol on proliferation of LTLT-Ca and RLT-Ca cells: the viability of cells was measured by MTT assay after 6 d of treatment as described in Materials and Methods.
Compared with LTLT-Ca cells, RLT-Ca cells exhibit a significantly marked stimulation of proliferation in response to estradiol at concentrations of 10 12 mol/L to
10 10 mol/L (*, P < 0.001). Estradiol markedly inhibited the growth of LTLT-Ca cells at concentrations of 10 6 mol/L to 104 mol/L (b, P < 0.01), but only at 10 4 mol/L of
estradiol in RLT-Ca cells (P < 0.01). C, protein expression profile of RLT-Ca cells compared with MCF-7Ca and LTLT-Ca cells: Expression of proteins was examined
using Western immunoblotting as described in Materials and Methods. Phosphorylated MAPK at 42 to 44 kDa, Her-2 at 185 kDa, ERa at 66 kDa, and h-actin at
45 kDa. The blots were stripped and reprobed for h-actin to verify equal loading. The blots show a single representative of three independent experiments.

Figure 3. A, effect of letrozole treatment on the growth of LTLT-Ca xenografts after 4 mo off letrozole: LTLT-Ca xenografts were grown in female OVX nude
mice as described in Materials and Methods. The mice were kept off letrozole treatment for a period of 4 mo. After which they were assigned to two groups
(on and off letrozole). The mice in the control and letrozole-treated groups exhibited significantly different growth rates. The difference in the exponential variable
governing growth was 42.3 (P = 0.04). B, effect of letrozole on the tumor weight of the LTLT-Ca xenografts: the mean tumor weight of control mice was 607.5 F

on the uterine weight of LTLT-Ca xenografts: the mean uterine weight of control mice was 83 F 21.45 mg, which was significantly different from those of the

mice at week 24 was found to be 196 F 169.4 mm3, whereas
without letrozole treatment, the mice had a mean tumor volume of
1,261.9 F 409.3 mm3 (P = 0.03). As shown in Fig. 3B, the tumor
weights of these two groups were also significantly different.
Furthermore, the low uterine weight in the letrozole-treated group
suggests that letrozole was effective in inhibiting the synthesis of
estrogen production (Fig. 3C).
Reversal of letrozole resistance in MCF-7Ca xenografts.
Consistent with our earlier report, letrozole treatment in MCF-7Ca
xenografts caused marked tumor regression, which was maintained
for a prolonged period. The mice treated with letrozole versus
androstenedione (control) had significantly lower growth rates

(P < 0.0001) and tumor volumes (P < 0.0001). After 22 weeks,
letrozole was discontinued in one group of mice (the ‘‘off ’’ group).
Tumors in these mice had a similar growth rate to that of the group
continued on letrozole over weeks 22 to 34. The difference in the
exponential variable governing growth rate (bi) was 0.002 F 0.12
(P = 0.99). This suggests that when resistance to letrozole develops,
discontinuing treatment does not affect the growth rate of tumors
significantly. When the mice in the ‘‘off ’’ group were put ‘‘back on’’
letrozole, the tumor growth was significantly reduced. The
difference in the exponential variable governing growth rate was
0.436 F 0.12 (P = 0.0005). Also, the ‘‘back on’’ group had a
significantly lower growth rate compared with the ‘‘letrozole’’

On week 34, the mice were sacrificed due to large tumor volumes

cleaned, weighed, and stored at 80jC. The tumor weights of the

mice in the control, letrozole, and ‘‘off ’’ groups were not statistically
different (P = 0.46; Fig. 4A).
However, the uterine weights exhibit significant differences
(Fig. 4B). As the mouse uterus is very sensitive to estrogens, the
measurement of uterine weight is a useful bioassay that indicates

the level of circulating estrogens in the mouse. The mice in the
‘‘letrozole’’ group had significantly lower uterine weights compared
with the control group (P = 0.0006) and the ‘‘off ’’ (P = 0.02) group,
indicating that aromatase was effectively inhibited by letrozole in
this group. However, the mice in the control and ‘‘off ’’ groups had
similar uterine weights (P = 1). Furthermore, the uterine weights of
mice in the control and ‘‘off ’’ groups correlated well with their
tumor weights. In contrast, the uterine weights of mice in the
letrozole group were markedly reduced and did not correlate with
the tumor weights. This suggests that estrogen production in the
control and ‘‘off ’’ groups was sufficient to stimulate tumor growth.
Although estrogen synthesis was suppressed as evidenced by low
uterine weight in the letrozole group, the growth of tumors in the
letrozole group was independent of estrogen.
Protein expression and activity after letrozole withdrawal in
MCF-7Ca xenografts. MCF-7Ca xenografts were examined for
changes in aromatase activity after treatment with letrozole.
Tumors used for this assay were collected at different time points
during the course of treatment (Fig. 4C). When treated with
letrozole, the aromatase activity of the tumors was significantly
lower compared with the control groups (P < 0.01 at 22 weeks and
P < 0.001 at 33 weeks). However, after discontinuing treatment
(off treatment for 22 weeks), aromatase activity increased and was
similar to the control levels (P < 0.001 compared with letrozole at
22 and 33 weeks). The aromatase activity, however, had increased
further by week 33, and it was significantly higher than the control
level (P < 0.001). When the mice were put ‘‘back on’’ letrozole, the
aromatase activity ceased to increase and remained at the same
level as the ‘‘off ’’ group at week 28 but it was still higher than the
levels in the control group (P < 0.01).
When protein expression was examined (Fig. 4D), tumors treated
with letrozole (22 weeks) exhibited a higher expression of Her-2,
phosphorylated Her-2, and phosphorylated MAPK compared with
controls. The levels increased further after 33 weeks. In contrast,
the tumors from the ‘‘off ’’ group showed decreased levels of Her-2,
phosphorylated Her-2, and phosphorylated MAPK compared with
letrozole-treated tumors and were similar to control tumors. On
the other hand, ERa and aromatase expression decreased with
letrozole treatment and was restored in the ‘‘off ’’ groups (28 and 33
weeks). These results suggest that tumors may adapt using the Her2/MAPK signaling pathway during letrozole treatment but revert to
the ERa pathway when letrozole is withdrawn.

Discussions
Despite significant advances in the treatment of breast cancer
since the development of aromatase inhibitors (15–17), some
patients eventually become resistant to treatment. Thus, it is
important to understand the mechanisms of this resistance and
determine how resistance to treatment can be overcome. We have
developed a xenograft model in order to investigate how cells adapt
and survive the effects of treatment. Although letrozole caused
marked inhibition of tumor growth initially, tumors eventually
acquired the ability to grow in the presence of letrozole and were
refractory to estrogen stimulation and second-line therapy with
antiestrogens (3, 8, 9).
Previous studies of cells isolated from the long-term letrozoletreated tumors (LTLT-Ca) revealed that overexpression of Her-2
and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway accompanied the
resistance to antiestrogens, aromatase inhibitors, androstenedione,
and estradiol (8, 18). In these cells, ER levels were reduced and cell

www.aacrjournals.org

growth was independent of estrogen, indicating cross-talk between
ERa and Her-2 (10). These results suggest that acquisition of
resistance and progression to hormone independence represents a
shift in the balance that leans towards growth factor signaling in
the presence of letrozole and back to hormonal signaling upon
withdrawal of the aromatase inhibitor. These results led to the
hypothesis that the Her-2/MAPK pathway provides a compensatory signaling mechanism for the cells when estrogen levels are
extremely low (10).
Analysis of the protein expression and aromatase activity in RLTCa cells revealed that Her-2 and the downstream signaling proteins
as well as ERa had returned to the levels in the original phenotype
(MCF-7Ca cells). Thus, RLT-Ca cells respond to estradiol,
androstenedione, aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant. The EC50
values for these RLT-Ca cells were similar to those previously
reported for MCF-7Ca cells (19). The response to tamoxifen,
however, was not completely restored in RLT-Ca cells.
The in vivo findings were consistent with the in vitro results.
When mice were inoculated with MCF-7Ca cells and treated with
letrozole, tumor growth was suppressed for several weeks, but
eventually, tumors began to grow despite continued treatment. By
22 weeks, the tumor volume reached twice the initial volume. The
mice were then divided into two groups. One group continued on
letrozole whereas treatment was then stopped in the other group
for 6 weeks. At week 28, half of the animals in the latter group
began treatment with letrozole again while the others continued
on androstenedione until week 33. When letrozole treatment was
discontinued, aromatase activity returned to MCF-7Ca control levels
by 28 weeks. However, at 33 weeks, aromatase activity was more than
3-fold higher than control levels. Although the mechanism of this
increase is unclear, previous studies have reported increased
aromatase activity after letrozole withdrawal, which has been
explained by stabilization and reduced degradation of the aromatase
protein. Interestingly, growth of tumors in the ‘‘off ’’ group was not
significantly different from those of the animals continuing on
letrozole. The increase in aromatase activity may contribute to an
increase in tumor growth in the ‘‘off ’’ group and may also contribute
to increased sensitivity of the tumors to letrozole in the ‘‘back on’’
group. The further increase in Her-2/MAPK signaling could drive the
growth of tumors on continuous letrozole treatment.
In conclusion, our results suggest that resistance to letrozole can
be reversed by discontinuing treatment for 6 weeks. These findings
suggest that alternating ‘‘on/off ’’ letrozole treatment may be an
effective way to delay resistance and prolong sensitivity to
aromatase inhibitors. This strategy could have advantages for
patients relapsing from aromatase inhibitor treatment.
