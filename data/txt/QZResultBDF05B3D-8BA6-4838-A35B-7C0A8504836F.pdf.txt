Abstract
Secondary resistance to hormonal therapy for breast cancer
commonly develops after an initial response to tamoxifen or
aromatase inhibitors. Agents to abrogate these adaptive
changes would substantially enhance the long-term benefits
of hormonal therapy. Our studies with a stilbene derivative
called TMS (2,3¶,4,5¶-tetramethoxystilbene) identified unexpected effects with potential utility for treatment of breast
tumors secondarily resistant to hormonal therapy. TMS was
originally developed as an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1B1
to block the conversion of estradiol to 4-OH-estradiol. While
studying this agent in three models of hormone resistance,
we detected direct antitumor effects not related to its role
as an inhibitor of catecholestrogens. During examination of
the mechanisms involved, we showed that treatment with
3 Mmol/L TMS for 24 h inhibited tubulin polymerization and
microtubule formation, caused a cell cycle block at the G2-M
phase, and induced apoptosis. TMS also inhibited activated
focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Akt, and mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) and stimulated c-jun-NH2-kinase and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. With respect to
antitumor effects, TMS at a concentrations of 0.2 to 0.3 Mmol/L
inhibited the growth of long-term tamoxifen-treated MCF-7
cells by 80% and fulvestrant-treated MCF-7 cells by 70%. In vivo
studies, involving 8 weeks of treatment with TMS via a 30-mg
s.c. implant, reduced tumor volume of tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts by 53%. Our data suggest that
TMS is a promising therapeutic agent because of its unique
ability to block several pathways involved in the development
of hormone resistance. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5717–26]

Introduction
Two-thirds of breast cancers, when excised at the time of
original diagnosis in women, contain estrogen or progesterone
receptors (1). The presence of these receptors predicts that
hormonal therapy will induce objective disease regressions lasting
for 12 to 18 months on average in the majority of patients with
advanced disease. However, tumor regrowth then occurs as a

reflection of the development of secondary hormonal resistance.
Substantial investigative effort has focused recently on the mechanisms potentially responsible for secondary resistance (2–6).
Comprehensive studies in breast cancer model systems have led
to the concept that cancer cells dynamically adapt in response to
various antihormonal therapies and up-regulate growth factor
pathways as a mechanism for resistance (2, 6, 7).
Women who have developed secondary resistance to one
hormonal therapy may often respond to a second- or third-line
hormonal therapy (1). However, nearly all women ultimately
become completely resistant and require alternative treatment
approaches, which generally involve cytotoxic chemotherapy (1).
Because of the side effects and toxicity associated with chemotherapy, therapy targeted to more specific intracellular signaling
events is a major focus of current research. The crosstalk between
estrogen receptors (ER) and growth factor receptor pathways in
secondarily resistant ER + breast cancer cells has suggested the use
of inhibitors of growth factor pathways rather than chemotherapy
at this stage of the disease (8). Both preclinical and early-phase
clinical trials are testing various combinations of inhibitors and
particularly those targeting the EGF-R, HER-2, and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Potential drawbacks are
that these agents can produce significant toxicity in the heart and
other organs, and that treatment might not be focused on targets
that are up-regulated in the individual patient. Based on these
concepts, a relatively nontoxic agent that would act upon multiple
targets but exert minimal toxicity would be a welcome addition to
the therapeutic armamentarium.
During the course of our studies, we identified unexpected
properties of a drug, called tetramethoxystilbene (TMS), a
synthetic derivative of the herbal product, rhapontigenin (9).
Rhapontigenin, a naturally occurring stilbene, is a potent
mechanism-based inactivator of cytochrome P450 1A1(10).
Trans-stilbene compounds have been chemically modified with
the goal of creating anticancer agents with a higher potency of
inhibition against cytochrome P450 1B1, an enzyme that catalyzes
the formation of potentially genotoxic estradiol metabolites (9–12).
Naturally occurring stilbenes have dihydroxyl groups on their
phenyl ring. Because substitution of dihydroxyl for dimethoxy
groups was thought to increase the lipophilicity and binding to
the active sites of the P450 family 1 enzymes, TMS was synthesized
such that dimethoxy groups were placed on the 3 and 5 positions
of the phenyl ring. TMS, a methoxy derivative of 2,4,3¶,5¶tetrahydroxystilbene, showed potent and selective inhibition of
P450 1B1 (9–11). The original rationale of our studies was to
evaluate the effect of TMS on the conversion of estradiol to 4-OHestradiol and ultimately on tumor formation (12). However, we

observed that TMS was highly effective in reducing cell number in
breast cancer cells in tissue culture. In an attempt to uncover the
mechanisms responsible for this effect, we discovered ‘‘off-target’’
actions including a marked inhibition of microtubule polymerization, substantial induction of apoptosis, and effects on several
growth factor signaling molecules.
This manuscript describes the effects of TMS on microtubule
polymerization, cell cycle dynamics, growth factor pathways, and
apoptosis. We found that this agent induces apoptosis in 80% to
90% of cells within a 48-h period and inhibits breast cancer cells
with secondary hormonal resistance more effectively in vivo and
in vitro than hormone-dependent cells. Based on its lack of apparent toxicity in intact animals, its antitumor effects in vitro and
in vivo, and its potent actions on cell signaling pathways, we
believe that this agent could potentially serve as an important
therapeutic agent for the treatment of women who develop
secondary resistance to hormonal therapy.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. TMS was synthesized as described previously (9). Tamoxifen
(TAM) and fulvestrant (ICI 182,780–ICI) were purchased from Sigma.
Sources of antibodies for Western analysis include Zymed Laboratories,
Inc. for total and phosphospecific mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) monoclonal antibodies and Cell Signaling Technology for
Ser473-phospho-Akt, total Akt, Thr389-phospho-p70 S6K, total p70 S6K,
Ser65-phospho-4E-BP1, total 4E-BP1, Tyr1068-phospho-EGF receptor, and
Tyr576/577-phospho–focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology for ERa. Cell culture medium (IMEM) was from Biosource
International, Inc. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine, and trypsin were
from Invitrogen. z-VAD was purchased from Calbiochem and was dissolved
in dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma Chemical Co.). Dextran-coated charcoalstripped FBS (DCC-FBS) was prepared as previously described (2).
Cell culture conditions. Wild-type MCF-7 cells were grown in IMEM
containing 5% FBS. Tamoxifen-resistant (TAM-R) MCF-7 cells were treated
with tamoxifen (10 7 M) continuously for more than 1 year with a change in
medium every 2 to 3 days (13). ICI 182,780 (ICI)–resistant MCF-7 cells were
treated with ICI (ICI 10 8 M) continuously over a period of more than
1 year. Long-term estradiol-deprived (LTED) cells were developed as
previously described (14) and maintained routinely in phenol red–free
IMEM supplemented with 5% DCC-FBS.
Assessment of cell growth. Cells were plated in six-well plates at a
density of 60,000 cells per well in their culture media. Two days later, the
cells were treated as described in figure legends for 5 days with media
change on day 3. Nuclei were prepared by sequential addition of 1 mL
HEPES-MgCl2 solution (0.01 mol/L HEPES and 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2) and
0.1 mL ZAP solution [0.13 mol/L ethylhexadecyldimethylammonium
bromide in 3% glacial acetic acid(v/v)] and counted using a model Z1
Coulter counter (Coulter Corp).
Cell proliferation. To specifically assess cell proliferation, 3H-thymidine
incorporation into DNA was assessed by methods previously described (15).
Plasma estradiol assay. Estradiol was measured with a previously
described RIA method involving purification with column chromatography
and use of an iodinated estradiol trace (Diagnostic Products Corp.). Assay
sensitivity is 5 pg/mL, and interassay precision averages 11% at a
concentration of 32 pg/mL (16).
Immunoblotting. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 60-mm dishes
and lysed with buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris (pH, 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
2.5 mmol/L sodium PPi, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate,
1 Ag/mL leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.
Cells were then pulse sonicated for 30 s at room temperature and
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell lysates were stored at 80jC. The
total protein concentration was determined using a standard Bradford
assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Western blots were carried out using primary

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

antibodies dissolved in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA);
secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000); and
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) to identify
bands on X-ray film.
Apoptotic cell death detection by ELISA. To quantitate histoneassociated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) in vitro in the
cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells undergoing early apoptosis, f8  104 MCF-7 cells
were plated per well into 12-well plates. After 2 days, the cells were treated
with either DMSO, 3 Amol/L TMS, or 10 nmol/L 17h-estradiol + 3 Amol/L
TMS. After 24 h, floating cells and adherent cells were collected for analysis.
A cell death detection ELISAPLUS apoptosis kit (Roche) was used as
described by the manufacturer. Experiments were done in triplicate, and
P values were determined using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.).
Measurement of DNA degradation via terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling assay. Apoptotic MCF-7 cells were
detected by terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling
(TUNEL) using the APO-BRDU Complete Flow Cytometry Analysis Kit
(Phoenix Flow Systems, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Controls included positive and negative cells provided in the kit following
the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cell cycle distribution. MCF-7 cells were grown in IMEM + 5% FBS.
Cells were treated with either DMSO or TMS for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h.
Both floating and adherent cells were collected and filtered through a
40-Am cell strainer (BD Falcon) to remove clumps. Cells were counted,
and 1  106 cells were hypotonically lysed in 1 mL of DNA staining
solution [3.4 mmol/L Tris (pH, 7.6), 0.075 mmol/L propidium iodide (PI),
0.1% NP40, and 700 units/L RNase A] for 10 min on ice. Samples were
then analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and
cell cycle distribution and percentage of cells within the sub-G1 peak were
determined using Modfit software (DNA Modelling System, Verity Software
House, Inc.).
Annexin V assay. MCF-7 cells were treated with either DMSO or 3 Amol/L
TMS for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h. Floating cells were collected by centrifugation
and added to adherent cells, which were gently lifted off the tissue culture
plate with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc.). A total of 20,000
MCF-7 cells were labeled with Annexin V–Alexa 488 antibody and PI using
an apoptosis detection kit (Invitrogen) and analyzed on a FACScalibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The distribution of apoptosis was determined using Cell QuestCell software (Becton Dickinson), and cells that were
Annexin V ( ) and PI ( ) were considered viable cells. Cells that were
Annexin V (+) and PI ( ) were considered early-stage apoptotic cells. Cells
that were Annexin V (+) and PI (+) were considered late-stage apoptotic
cells. Cells that were PI (+) and Annexin V ( ) were considered necrotic.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. MCF-7 cells were grown for 24 h on
coverslips pretreated with poly-lysine to enhance cell flattening and
adherence and then incubated in the presence or absence of TMS (0.1, 1,
5, 10, and 50 Amol/L) for 20 h. Control cells were incubated with vehicle
alone. Cells were fixed in 10% formalin (20 min, 25jC) and permeabilized in
methanol ( 20j, 10 min). Nonspecific antibody staining was blocked with
20% normal goat serum in PBS, and cells were incubated with DM1a anti–
a-tubulin antibody (Sigma Chemicals; 1:1,000 dilution) followed by goat
anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma Chemicals; 1:500
dilution) for 1 h at 37jC to visualize microtubules. Nuclei were stained with
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.2 Ag/mL in PBS; Sigma Chemicals) for
1 min. Coverslips were mounted with Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes)
and viewed and photographed with a 60 objective using an ORCA II digital
camera driven by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) on a Nikon
Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope.
Purification of tubulin and microtubule polymerization. Microtubule protein preparations consisting of tubulin and microtubule-associated
proteins were isolated from bovine brain by three cycles of polymerization
and depolymerization. Tubulin was purified from the microtubule protein
by phosphocellulose chromatography, drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at 70jC (17). On the day of use, tubulin was thawed on ice and
centrifuged (17,000  g, 20 min, 4jC) to remove aggregated or denatured
tubulin. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using
BSA as standard. For polymerization, tubulin (2.75 mg/mL) was mixed

Figure 1. TMS inhibits hormone-resistant MCF-7 cell number. A, hormone-dependent parental MCF-7 cancer cells, hormone-independent MDA-MB-468 cells,
and benign MCF-10A cells were treated with TMS for 5 d with cell counts at that time point. To normalize results among experiments, results are expressed as

with a range of concentrations of TMS in 100 mmol/L PIPES, 1 mmol/L
MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and 1 mmol/L GTP. Microtubule seeds were
prepared with the same solution (without TMS) plus 10% glycerol and 10%
DMSO by incubating at 30jC for 30 min and shearing the assembled
microtubules six times through a 25G 7/8 in needle. Microtubule
polymerization was initiated by adding seeds to the tubulin solution and
was monitored at 30jC by light scattering at 350 nm using a Beckman DU
640 spectrophotometer.
Mouse xenograft model. Tumor fragments (30–40 mg) of TAM-R
MCF-7 human mammary tumors were implanted s.c. as xenografts in
oophorectomized nude mice (Charles River Labs) aged 4 to 5 weeks at the
start of the experiment. Animals containing continuously passaged tumors
in tamoxifen-treated animals were obtained as a gift from V.C. Jordan
(Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA; ref. 18). Estradiol was delivered
to produce plasma levels of 280 pg/mL with an ‘‘estradiol clamp,’’ silastic
capsule method previously described (19). Treatment with s.c. silastic
capsules containing 30 mg TMS was started when tumors reached a
measurable size (f300 mm3), about 6 months after inoculation. Tumors
were measured at least weekly with calipers, and volumes were calculated
using the formula 4/3p  r21  r 2 (r 1 < r 2) during 8 weeks. All animal
experiments were conducted under Federal and Institutional guidelines and
approved by the University of Virginia Animal Care and Use Committee.

(day and drug) and a random effect (mouse) was fitted, and the
statistical significance of the drug effect was examined with the
significance level 0.05. In particular, log10 transformation was used for
MCF tumor volume data to produce a linear relationship between tumor
volumes and days.

Results
The effects of TMS on breast cancer cell growth. Initially, we
tested the effect of TMS on growth of several breast cell lines,
including benign ER-negative MCF10A, malignant receptor–
negative MDA-MB-468, and hormone-dependent parental MCF-7
cells and three varieties of secondarily hormone-resistant MCF-7
cell lines (TAM-R, fulvestrant-resistant and LTED).
TMS inhibited the wild-type MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells by
50% at a concentration of f1 Amol/L with greater suppression
at higher doses (Fig. 1A). The benign MCF10A cells were inhibited
by 50% at a similar concentration, but with a plateau at higher
doses. All three secondarily resistant cells lines were inhibited by
50% at TMS concentrations of f0.1 to 0.3 Amol/L (Fig. 1B). With
increasing doses, the cells exhibited a 70% to 90% reduction in
cell number in a dose response fashion with increasing concentration of TMS until a plateau was reached at 0.3 to 1 Amol/L
(see Fig. 1B).
TMS is known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 1A1 and 1B1
enzymes and, thus, to reduce the conversion of estradiol to

2-hydroxyestradiol and 4-hydroxyestradiol. Other investigators
have shown that these catecholestrogens could potentially
stimulate proliferation of breast cancer cells (20). Accordingly,
we considered that TMS might inhibit cell number by blocking

control mitotic cells (a), spindles were bipolar, and all chromosomes were
congressed to a compact metaphase plate. However, in the presence of 1 Amol/L
TMS (c ), mitotic cells contained multiple asters of very short microtubules and
chromosomes were disorganized. Interphase control cells (b) and interphase
cells incubated with 1 Amol/L (d) or 10 Amol/L TMS (e) exhibited microtubules,
but the cells were less well spread in the presence of TMS, and the overall
microtubule polymer was reduced. Microtubules were depolymerized, and the
cytoplasm was severely reduced after incubation with 50 Amol/L TMS (e). TMS
incubation induced frequent multinucleated cells (d, top cell , and f ). Bar, 5 Am.

4-hydroxylation of estradiol. To examine this possibility, we
attempted to rescue the cells from TMS blockade by adding the
products of these enzymes, 2-OH- and 4-OH-estradiol, respectively, as well as the substrate estradiol, to the cells receiving TMS. All
three cell lines exhibited a similar degree of inhibition of cell
number in the presence of added 2-OH-estradiol and of 4-OHestradiol, as well as estradiol itself. These results clearly indicated
that the mechanism of TMS to reduce cell number was not
mediated by the inhibitory effects of TMS on cytochrome P450
1A1 and 1B1 with the resulting reduction of catecholestrogen
formation (see Fig. 1C).
We then questioned whether the TMS effects might represent
generalized toxicity to the breast cancer cells with resulting
increase in necrotic cell death, as evidenced by trypan blue uptake
at 24 h of exposure to TMS. Surprisingly, a large fraction of the
secondarily resistant cells detached from the culture plates (see
Supplementary Fig. S1) in response to TMS. The parental MCF-7
cells seemed less sensitive to this effect of TMS, as shown above for
inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 1A). Although detached, these cells
were still able to exclude trypan blue, a finding that excluded
necrotic cell death and provided evidence of continued viability
(Fig. 1D).
Effects of TMS on tubulin polymer mass and mitosis. The
detachment of viable cells at 24 h suggested that TMS might
exert specific effects on cellular structures that mediate
adherence to culture plate surfaces. Resveratrol, a stilbene with
a structure similar to TMS, had been reported to interfere with
microtubule function (21). Accordingly, we examined the effect
of TMS on microtubule polymerization. A microtubule polymerization assay was used to study this phenomenon. Concentrations of TMS ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 Amol/L inhibited
microtubule polymerization in a time and dose response
fashion, with a maximum inhibition of 50% of vehicle control
(Fig. 2A).
The effects of TMS on microtubule organization in cells. The
effects of TMS (1–50 Amol/L) on microtubule arrays and
chromatin in fixed MCF-7 cells are shown in Fig. 2B. TMS induced
highly abnormal mitotic spindles and multinucleated cells. In
control mitotic cells, most spindles were bipolar (Fig. 2Ba), with
all the chromosomes congressed to a compact metaphase plate
and interphase cells (Fig. 2Bb) were well spread with an array
of fine filamentous microtubules. At 1 Amol/L TMS (Fig. 2Bc),
mitotic microtubules were very short and stubby and arranged
in multiple asters, and chromosomes were in a disorganized ballshaped mass. Interphase cells at 1 and 10 Amol/L TMS (Fig. 2Bd
and f ) contained intact microtubules, but the overall mass of
microtubules was reduced, and the cells were less well spread.
At 50 Amol/L TMS (Fig. 2Be), cells were small and had very little
cytoplasm, and microtubules seemed depolymerized. In addition,
after incubation with TMS (1–50 Amol/L), many cells became
multinucleated (Fig. 2Bd and f ), a phenomenon that is often seen
after escape from mitotic arrest induced by microtubule-targeted
drugs (22).
TMS induces G2-M cell cycle arrest. Blockade of microtubule
polymerization can result in arrest of the cell cycle at the S or
G2-M phase depending on the specific microtubule polymerization
agent used (23). We carried out fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis using PI to stain DNA and examined MCF-7 cells that had
been treated for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h in the absence or presence of
3 Amol/L TMS. We found that at 36 h, a large percentage of the
TMS-treated cells were arrested in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle

Figure 3. TMS induces G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A, cell cycle analysis of MCF-7 cells after treatment with 0.1% DMSO or 3 Amol/L TMS.
After 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of treatment, cells were labeled with PI and analyzed by DNA flow cytometry. The fraction of cells in the G1, S, and G2-M phases at the
indicated times are shown by the numbers included in the panels. The percent of cells in the sub-G1 phase is shown in (A) and quantitated in (B ).

when compared with the control DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 3A,
compare G1 with G2-M peaks). The increased G2-M peak is
consistent with what has been reported for the microtubule
inhibitor nocodazole (24). In addition, after 48 h treatment with
3 Amol/L TMS, we observed a sub-G1 peak that is apparent in
Fig. 3A (bottom right), suggesting the possibility of apoptosis.
Modfit was used to quantitate the sub-G1 peak, and an increase
from 2% at 12 h to a maximum of 20% at 36 and 48 h (Fig. 3B) was
observed. The sub-G1 peak was negligible in the DMSO-treated
control cells.
The flow cytometry studies indicated a cell cycle arrest, but
were not optimized to detect an inhibition of DNA synthesis.
For that reason, we conducted 3H-thymidine uptake experiments

www.aacrjournals.org

to directly examine the effect of TMS on DNA synthesis. Under
conditions of high and low serum concentrations, 3 Amol/L TMS
caused a 50% inhibition of 3H-thymidine uptake (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
TMS induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The presence
of viable (i.e., trypan blue excluding) floating cells at 24 h and the
sub-G1 peak on flow cytometry suggested that TMS triggers
apoptosis. To distinguish apoptosis from necrosis at later time
points, we examined Annexin V and PI staining followed by flow
cytometry. We found that at 12 h, only 6% of the TMS-treated cells
were apoptotic (see Supplementary Fig. S3, compare DMSO-treated
to TMS, sum of early and late apoptosis). At 24 h, apoptosis
increased to 12%, and at 36 and 48 h, apoptosis increased to 40%.

During each time point, the maximum percent of necrotic cells
in the TMS-treated groups was 0.73% compared with 0.88% in the
DMSO-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3, compare top left
quadrant DMSO to TMS).
As further evidence of apoptosis, we carried out an antihistone/DNA monoclonal antibody ELISA assay, which examines
double-strand DNA breaks occurring at an early stage. Three
cell lines, parental, LTED, and Tam-R, were treated with either
ethanol, 3 Amol/L TMS, or 3 Amol/L TMS + 10 nmol/L E2 for
24 h and assayed by ELISA. We found that addition of 3 Amol/L
TMS resulted in an increase in the level of dsDNA and
nucleosomes present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A–C compare lanes
1 to 2). Because it is known that the microtubule active agent,
paclitaxel, is inhibited in the presence of estradiol, we also
tested whether the addition of estradiol would inhibit the action
of TMS in these cell lines (25, 26). When 10 nmol/L E2 was
added in the presence of TMS, there was no decrease in the
level of apoptosis for the parental or LTED cells (Fig. 4A and B,
compare lanes 2 with 3) and only a slight decrease in the
TAM-R cells (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 2 with 3). Most, but not

all, types of programmed cell death involve activation of
caspases (27). For this reason, we examined the effects of the
pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD, and showed blockade of TMSelicited apoptosis, a finding providing strong evidence for the
presence of caspase-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A–C, compare
lanes 2 to 4).
We then used the TUNEL assay to detect single- and doublestranded DNA breaks as free 3¶OH-termini incorporating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Parental MCF-7 cells were treated with
either DMSO or 3 Amol/L TMS for 24 h (top), 36 h (middle) or 48 h
(bottom; Fig. 4D). No significant level of BrdUrd was incorporated
into the control or TMS-treated cells at 24 h (Fig. 4D compare
left top to right top). At 36 and 48 h, 83% of the TMS-treated cells
contained apoptotic nuclei as compared with only 1.6% in the
control cells exposed to DMSO.
Most types of apoptosis involve the cleavage of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) as molecular signature of apoptosis
(28). We therefore examined the effect of TMS on the cleavage of
this protein and the ability of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD
to block these effects. TMS caused an increase in the p85

Figure 4. TMS induces cell death. A, MCF-7 cells were treated with TMS (3 Amol/L) for 24 h. ELISA cell death detection kit showed that TMS increases apoptosis three
times higher than control. Estradiol did not block TMS effects. B, LTED cells show more apoptosis with the E2 plus TMS treatment than with the TMS treatment
alone based on OD/105 at 24 h. C, estradiol blocked TMS effects slightly in TAM-R cells. D, MCF-7 cells were harvested and studied with APO-BRDU TUNEL assay.
MCF-7 cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO or 3 Amol/L TMS for 24, 36, or 48 h. Cells were double-stained with BrdUrd and PI and analyzed for apoptosis by DNA flow
cytometry. The numbers in the boxes indicate the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells. DMSO showed 1.36% apoptosis among live cell population, but 3 Amol/L
TMS treatment for 48 h induced 82.4% apoptosis.

expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting using phosphospecific antibodies against MAPK, p38, JNK, Akt, 4-E-BP-1 and FAK. B, Parental MCF-7 cells after

cleavage product of PARP, an effect blocked by z-VAD (see
Supplementary Fig. S4). As an indication of the mechanism
of apoptosis, the c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125)
also blocked PARP cleavage, but the p38 inhibitor (SB 203580)
did not.
TMS inhibits multiple signaling pathways. Disruption of
microtubules is known to trigger a sequence of downstream
signaling events resulting in apoptosis (29). Accordingly, we
next sought to identify the signal transduction pathways
involved in regulating cell survival and cell death using Western
blot techniques. Activated JNK and p-38 increased substantially
with initial increases at concentrations of TMS of 0.3 and
3 Amol/L, respectively. As evidence of specificity of its effects,
phospho-MAPK and total MAPK levels did not change with
TMS. However, we did detect reduced phosphorylation of Akt,
FAK, and 4-E-BP-1(T-70) at concentrations above 1 Amol/L
(Fig. 5A).
Biological effects of JNK and p-38 activation. The morphologic appearance of floating cells (Fig. 5B) occurred during the
same time frame as the activation of JNK and p38. We reasoned
then that the floating cells might be used as a bioassay for JNK and
p38 effects. Accordingly, we used JNK and p38 inhibitors and
assessed their effects on floating cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, the

www.aacrjournals.org

specific inhibitors markedly decreased the number of floating cells,
providing evidence that the activation of JNK and p-38 markedly
influences cell detachment. As additional evidence, these inhibitors
also blocked apoptosis as quantitated by the ELISA assay
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
Effects of TMS on a breast xenograft model. We implanted
tumor fragments (30–40 mg) of TAM-R MCF-7 human mammary
tumor cells into both flanks of athymic mice. Six months after
implantation of tumors, the xenografts reached measurable size
(f300 mm3). The group (n = 5) treated with vehicle alone grew
substantially over the 56-day period of observation. Two months
of continuous treatment with TMS, using 30 mg s.c. implants
(n = 4, reduced tumor volume by 53% when compared with
control (P < 0.02). In the parental MCF-7 cells xenograft model,
the 30-mg TMS implant (n = 16) reduced tumor volume by
41.7% when compared with control (n = 17; Fig. 6A), but this
effect did not reach statistical significance. Animals receiving
the 30-mg implant of TMS for 2 months tolerated this procedure
well and exhibited no apparent systemic toxicity. As evidence
of this, there were no changes in total body weight, uterine
weight (Fig. 6B) ovarian weight, and plasma estradiol levels and
no changes in liver and renal histology (see Supplementary
Figs. S6 and S7).

Discussion
TMS, a tetramethoxystilbene, effectively inhibits the growth of
breast cancer cells engineered to become secondarily resistant to
tamoxifen, fulvestrant, or estradiol deprivation, a therapeutic
maneuver analogous to either use of aromatase inhibitors or
surgical oophorectomy (9, 10). Although TMS was developed as an
inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1B1, we showed that it exerts its
effects on breast cancer cells through multiple actions, including
inhibition of microtubule polymerization; blockade of cells at the
G2-M phase of the cell cycle; increase in the activation of p-38
kinase and JNK; reduction in the phosphorylation of FAK, Akt, and
4E-BP-1; and the induction of apoptosis. Notably, our studies
showed that TMS inhibits the growth of TAM-R breast cancer
xenografts in vivo without evidence of systemic or organ-specific
toxicity. These properties suggest that TMS has potential as a new
therapeutic approach for breast cancers that develop secondary
hormonal resistance.
The effect of TMS on apoptosis in vitro was especially dramatic
with 80–90% of cells undergoing programmed cell death by 48 h of
exposure. The magnitude of this process required verification that
cell death did not merely represent necrosis, and that apoptosis
was indeed present. Accordingly, our study used multiple
methods to provide definitive evidence of programmed cell death
and the lack of necrotic toxicity. These included the use of an
ELISA apoptosis assay, flow cytometry coupled with the BrdUrdbased TUNEL and Annexin V methods, demonstration of a sub-G1
peak on flow cytometry, blockade of apoptosis with the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD, examination of the formation of the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

89-kDa PARP cleavage product and its blockade with z-VAD, and
exclusion of necrotic cell death with a trypan blue viability test.
To further rule out necrotic cell death, we used the Annexin V
flow cytometry–based assay and showed that a maximum of only
0.73% of cells were necrotic under all conditions examined. Taken
together, these various methods provided compelling evidence of
the presence of apoptosis and absence of significant necrotic cell
death.
One mechanism whereby TMS induces apoptosis seems to be
related to its effects on microtubule polymerization. Agents such
as colchicines and nocodazole block microtubule polymerization
in a manner similar to TMS and also trigger apoptosis (30).
Exactly how apoptosis occurs is not completely understood, but
a marked up-regulation of p-38 kinase and JNK occurs in association with this phenomenon. A suggested mechanism is that
microtubule inhibitors release MLK-2 from binding to specific
sites on tubulin and free it to act as an upstream kinase (MAP
KKK) in the JNK kinase cascade sequence (31). JNK itself is
known to mediate apoptosis under certain circumstances. Our
data showing blockade of PARP cleavage with a JNK inhibitor
support a role for JNK in the apoptotic process. These
observations, taken in concert, would suggest that blockade of
microtubule polymerization might be a primary effect of TMS
and result in the secondary activation of JNK and p38 kinase.
However, additional primary effects of TMS on other targets such
as FAK, Akt, and mTOR might also be possible (32, 33). Further
experiments are necessary to precisely determine which effects
of TMS are primary and which are secondary to more upstream
events.

Hormone-Resistant Breast Cancer Treatment with TMS

Treatment of neoplastic diseases with other microtubuleinteracting agents such as the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids provide
effective therapy but are associated with substantial toxicity
(30, 34). Our data with TMS revealed no apparent systemic
toxicity at concentrations which effectively blocked growth of
secondarily resistant breast cancer xenografts in vivo. Parameters
used to assess systemic toxicity included total body weight, plasma
estradiol levels, uterine and ovarian weight, and histologic changes
in the liver or kidney (Supplementary Fig. S7). More detailed
studies will be required to assess toxicity in greater depth and
particularly neurotoxicity.
An important consideration is the relative efficacy and toxicity
of TMS compared with another class of microtubule active
agents, the taxanes, because both compounds exert similar
actions. TMS inhibits phosphorylation of FAK, Akt, and mTOR
and stimulates JNK and p38 MAPK activity. Paclitaxel also
inhibits Akt and increases JNK and p38 MAPK activity (35, 36).
However, paclitaxel acts differently than TMS in that it blocks
microtubule depolymerization and causes stabilization of these
structures. Comparative studies on antitumor efficacy, toxicity,
and organ specificity will be required to fully address potential
differences between these agents. An important consideration,
however, is the observation that the herbal parent of TMS,
rhapontigenin, has been used in oriental medicine for more than
three millennia without untoward toxicity. While speculative, this
would suggest that TMS, a derivative of rhapontigenin, might be
relatively nontoxic as well.

Our current studies are intriguing but still contain weaknesses
that we plan to address in the near future. For example, we have not
as yet conducted rigorous experiments to determine if wild-type
breast cancer cells of several derivations (i.e., ZR-75-1, T 47D, cloned
MCF-7, or others) also seem to be less sensitive to TMS than their
secondarily resistant counterparts. This could be important for
concluding that TMS might be an ideal agent for treating hormoneresistant disease. However, because hormone therapy is effective
initially in receptor-positive breast cancer, it is unlikely that TMS
would be chosen to replace this modality of therapy. Thus, it is not
essential to our conclusions that hormone-resistant cells be more
sensitive to TMS than parental cells. Another issue we considered is
that we did not examine DNA laddering, which is usually required
for demonstration of apoptosis when using a new antiapoptotic
agent. However, this technique requires the activation of caspase 3,
a factor lacking in MCF-7 cells (37). Finally, it will be important in
future studies to carefully examine whether TMS induces apoptosis
via mitochondrial or death receptor pathways and to dissect out the
precise mechanisms by which apoptosis occurs.
