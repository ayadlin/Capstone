ABSTRACT
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma characterized by
the chromosomal translocation t(11;14) that leads to constitutive expression of cyclin
D1, a master regulator of the G1-S phase. Chk1 inhibitors have been recently shown
to be strongly effective as single agents in MCL. To investigate molecular mechanisms
at the basis of Chk1 inhibitor activity, a MCL cell line resistant to the Chk1 inhibitor
PF-00477736 (JEKO-1 R) was obtained and characterized. The JEKO-1 R cell line
was cross resistant to another Chk1 inhibitor (AZD-7762) and to the Wee1 inhibitor
MK-1775. It displayed a shorter doubling time than parental cell line, likely due to a
faster S phase. Cyclin D1 expression levels were decreased in resistant cell line and its
re-overexpression partially re-established PF-00477736 sensitivity. Gene expression
profiling showed an enrichment in gene sets involved in pro-survival pathways in
JEKO-1 R. Dasatinib treatment partly restored PF-00477736 sensitivity in resistant
cells suggesting that the pharmacological interference of pro-survival pathways
can overcome the resistance to Chk1 inhibitors. These data further corroborate the
involvement of the t(11;14) in cellular sensitivity to Chk1 inhibitors, fostering the
clinical testing of Chk1 inhibitors as single agents in MCL.

INTRODUCTION

Overexpression of cyclin D1 occurs as a result of the
chromosomal translocation t(11;14)q(13;32), which fuses
the enhancer promoter of the immunoglobulin heavy chain
gene with the transcription unit of the CCND1 protooncogene, and characterizes all MCL cases. Additional
genetic alterations occur in subsets of MCL and are related
to the cell cycle machinery and to the cellular response
to DNA damage [1, 4]. Specifically, many genetic lesions
involve other important components of the G1/S phase
cell cycle regulatory checkpoint, such as p16INK4
(deletion), and CDK4 (amplification) which together with
the overexpression of cyclin D1 contribute to impair the
control of G1-S transition in MCL [5].

Mantle Cell Lymphoma is a subtype of non
Hodgkin Lymphoma characterized by an unfavourable
clinical course with a median overall survival of only
4-5 years [1-3]. Although this lymphoma presents an
initial high response to first line treatment, its clinical
course is characterized by continuous relapses, resulting
in a discouraging long term outcome, thus MCL is
considered non curable with current therapies and the
identification of new and effective therapeutic strategies
is of fundamental importance [4]. Deregulation of cell
cycle is the characteristic pathogenic hallmark of MCL.

Cell cycle checkpoints are constantly activated in
the cells after exogenous and endogenous DNA damage
to avoid their cycling without having fixed the DNA
damage [6]. The serine/threonine kinase Chk1 is a crucial
player of the cell cycle checkpoints machinery, being
activated after exogenous DNA damage, such as the
damage caused by cytotoxic agents, and activating the S
and G2 checkpoints, by coordinating various aspects of
DNA repair, such as the homologous recombination repair
and by inducing apoptosis whenever necessary [7, 8]. In
the last years Chk1 inhibitors have been developed in
combination with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics (especially
antimetabolites such as gemcitabine, hydroxyurea, and
cytarabine) to potentiate their genotoxic effects [9-11].
Recently, a role of Chk1 in the absence of exogenous
DNA damage for cell proliferation and survival, mostly
due to its crucial role in regulating CDKs activity and
in controlling DNA replication, has been described and
corroborated by many experimental evidence, suggesting
that Chk1 inhibitors could also be effective as single
agents in tumors with a specific genetic background [1214]. For example Chk1 inhibition caused cell death in the
U2OS osteosarcoma cell line [15], it has been shown to
be a crucial therapeutic target in neuroblastoma [16] and
in melanoma cell lines with high levels of endogenous
replicative stress [17]. Tumor cells deficient in Fanconi
anemia pathway are hypersensitive to Chk1 inhibition
[18] and Chk1 inhibitors are effective against Myc-

driven malignancies, such as certain B-cell lymphomas
and some breast and lung cancers [19, 20]. Recently, the
protein kinase Wee1 has been shown to be in synthetic
lethality with Chk1. Combined treatment with Chk1 and
Wee1 inhibitors showed a strong synergistic cytotoxic
effect in various human cancer cell lines suggesting that
this combined target specific strategy could be a valid
therapeutic approach against cancer [21-23]. We recently
found that the have activity of the combination of Chk1
and Wee1 inhibitors is strikingly effective in preclinical
models of MCL, at extremely low doses, providing a
strong rational for its possible successful application in
the clinical setting for this disease [24]. Interestingly,
MCL cell lines were also extremely sensitive to the Chk1
inhibitor PF-00477736 as single agent. To investigate the
molecular mechanisms at the basis of the Chk1 inhibitor
activity in MCL, a MCL cell line, JEKO-1, resistant to a
Chk1 inhibitor was isolated and characterized.

In order to get more insights on the response
mechanisms to Chk1 inhibitors of MCL, we selected a

MCL cell line, JEKO-1, resistant to the Chk1 inhibitor
PF-00477736 by treating cells for about one year with
growing concentrations of PF-00477736 (see details
in materials and methods). Figure 1A shows the PF00477736 sensitivity of the parental (JEKO-1) and
resistant (JEKO-1 R) cells. The JEKO-1 R cell line was
at least seven times more resistant to PF-00477736 than
its parental cell line (IC 50 value of 140±5 nM vs 20.6
±4 nM); the resistance was stable for at least 5 months
after isolation and propagation in culture conditions with
no drug (experimental conditions used for the subsequent
experiments). JEKO-1 R cell line resulted more resistant
also to another Chk1 inhibitor (AZD-7762) (IC 50 of
222.6 ±3 nM vs 36.7± 2 nM) (Figure 1B). To exclude
that the acquired resistance to Chk1 inhibition could
be due to higher extrusion of the drug from the cells,

MDR-1 (multidrug resistant gene, coding for the ABCB1
ATP-dependent drug efflux membrane pump), MRP1 (coding for the ABCC1 membrane pump) and BCRP
(coding for ABCG2 membrane pump) expression levels
were monitored and resulted similarly expressed in the
parental and resistant cell lines (Supplementary Figure
1). Moreover, treatment with Doxorubicin, substrate of
the three membrane pumps, showed similar activity in the
parental and resistant JEKO-1 cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 1). Considering the functional inter-relationship
and the pharmacological synergism observed treating
with Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors [21], we next evaluated the
cytotoxic response of both cell lines to the Wee1 inhibitor
MK-1775, and found that the JEKO-1-R cell line was
more resistant to this drug as compared to the parental
cell line (IC50 of 241±15 nM vs 56.8 ± 6 nM) (Figure

1 R (20.5 hours) versus parental cell line (26.1 hours).
FACS analysis was then performed at different time points
after cells seeding (Figure 2B). Cell cycle distribution
appeared slightly different between the two cell lines with
higher percentage of cells in S phase in parental and a
more emphasized G2-M peak in the resistant cell line. To
better investigate the duration of S phase, BrdUrd pulsechase analysis was performed in parental and resistant
cells harvesting the samples immediately after BrdUrd
labeling and after 7 hours; this time point was chosen
as previous experiments indicated that it is a time point
sufficient to follow cell progression through S phase. This
analysis confirmed the higher percentage of S-phase cells
in JEKO-1 parental cells than the JEKO-1 resistant ones
(52.4 vs 44.1 at time 0 and 38.9 vs 30.6 at time 7). The
higher percentage of S phase cells can be ascribed to a
lower DNA synthesis rate and thus to a longer duration of
the phase, confirmed by the higher percentage of labelled
undivided cells and by lower relative movement (RM)
observed at 7 hr in JEKO-1 respect to JEKO-1 R (Figure
2C). The extrapolated duration of the different cell cycle
phases (Figure 2D) showed that JEKO-1 R cells display a
quicker S phase as compared to the parental cell line and
this finding may explain the difference in doubling times
observed between the two cell lines.
We next evaluated the expression of the S phase
molecular markers Cdt1 and cyclin A, finding out that they
were decreased both at the mRNA and at the protein levels
in the JEKO-1 R cell line (Figure 3A-3B). Moreover,
based on our previous evidence of an involvement of
the translocation t(11;14) in PF-00477736 sensitivity
[24], we evaluated the expression of cyclin D1, that the
translocation in MCL renders constitutively active, and
a decrease in its expression levels (both mRNA and

1C). On the contrary, sensitivity of the two cell lines to
bendamustine and bortezomib, drugs commonly used for
the treatment of MCL [25], resulted comparable (Figure
1D-1E). The activity of other DNA damaging agents, that
notably activate Chk1, was also evaluated and found to be
alike (Supplementary Table 1).
We evaluated the activation of apoptosis in JEKO-1
parental and resistant cell line after treatment for 24 and
72 hours with PF-00477736 at equimolar (15 nM) and
at equitoxic IC50s concentrations (15 nM and 150 nM
respectively for JEKO-1 and in JEKO-1 R). A caspase 3
activity was detected in JEKO-1 parental at 15 nM, but
not in JEKO-1 R at this concentration; however apoptosis
could be detected in JEKO-1R cells after treatment with
a dose of 150 nM (Supplementary Figure 2A). These
data were corroborated by the TUNEL assay performed
in the same experimental conditions (Supplementary
Figure 2B). Similarly, at the corresponding IC50s in both
cell lines, treatment with PF-00477736 induces γH2AX
(Supplementary Figure 2C), which persisted longer in
JEKO-1R. All these data suggest that resistant cell line
still sensed the DNA damage and was able to respond by
activating apoptosis.

We next evaluated, if any, differences in cell

protein) could be observed in JEKO-1 R cell line (Figure
3A-3B and Supplementary Figure 3). A PCR analysis
confirmed the presence of the t(11;14) in the resistant cell
line (data not shown), suggesting that resistance is not
due to the selection of cell clone loosing the t(11,14). In
addition, treatments with both 5’aza-deocycitidine and
actinomycin D led us to exclude any role of epigenetic
and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in determining
lower cyclin D1 levels in JEKO1-R cells (data not shown).
We also evaluated Chk1 protein levels and its activating
status (phosphorylation in S317) finding out that,
comparable total protein levels of Chk1 were associated
with a substantial decrease in constitutive activation of
Chk1 in the JEKO-1 R cells as compared to the parental
cell line (Figure 3C).

Our previous data suggested that the high activity
of the complex CDK4/6-cyclin D1 due to the presence
of the t(11;14) could potentially explain the sensitivity to
PF-00477736 [24]. To assess if the decrease in expression
level of cyclin D1 could be related to the acquired PF00477736 resistance, we induced re over-expression of
this protein in the resistant cell line through a lentiviral
expression system. A significant re-overexpression of
cyclin D1 as compared to the JEKO-1 R cell line infected
with the control empty vector, could be obtained in cyclin
D1 infected cells (Figure 4A), although it did not reach the
expression levels of the parental cell line. However, when
we evaluated the effects of cyclin D1 re-expression on the

sensitivity to PF-00477736 in the resistant cell line could
be observed (Figure 4B).

Contribution of SRC pathway to the resistance to
Chk1 inhibitor

Chk1 is a key regulator of the S and G2 checkpoints,
replication initiation and replication fork stability, being
required during normal S phase to avoid deleterious
DNA breakage and to ensure maintenance of genome
integrity [7, 12]. In recent years the development of
Chk1 inhibitors has been considered to enhance the
effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs [28]. However,
the emerging evidence of the crucial role of Chk1 during
normal cell cycle progression, prompted the study of the
effect of Chk1 inhibitors as single agents, as an alternative
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of some tumors. The
identification of the molecular markers responsible for
the extreme sensitivity to Chk1 inhibitors of some tumors
is of paramount importance because it could provide
tailoring opportunities to stratify the most responsive
patients maximizing the effects of this targeted therapy.
We have recently demonstrated that MCL cells are
extremely sensitive to the Chk1 inhibitor PF-004777736
as single agent, much more than other B cell lymphoma
cell lines and different epithelial carcinoma cell lines [21,
24]. Our experimental data suggested a correlation of the
t(11;14) chromosomal translocation with Chk1 inhibitor
sensitivity. A higher cytotoxicity of PF-00477736 was
observed in a panel of MM cell lines displaying the
t(11;14) as compared to those without the translocation
and the inhibition of the CDK4/6 cyclin D1 complex
activity, which in MCL cell lines is over-activated, partly
neutralized the cytotoxic effect of the Chk1 inhibitor
[24]. In order to better investigate the molecular markers
responsible for the high response to the Chk1 inhibitor

DISCUSSION

To get further insights in the molecular mechanisms
at the basis of the acquired resistance to PF-00477736,
gene expression profiles were obtained in untreated
parental and resistant cells. The transcripts down-regulated
in the JEKO-1 R cell line were enriched of genes involved
in cell cycle progression and E2F1 targets (Supplementary
Table 2, Supplementary Figure 4), while the up-regulated
genes were enriched of gene sets involved in cell survival
and proliferative pathways (such as NFKB, SRC/MAPK
pathways) (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Figure
5). Since FGR, coding for a member of the SRC family,
was the most up-regulated transcript in the JEKO-1 R cell
line (Supplementary Table 3), as also validated by real
time PCR (Figure 5A), we decided to test the combination
of PF-00477736 with the clinically available dual Src/
Abl kinase inhibitor dasatinib [27]. A partial restoration of
PF-00477736 sensitivity was observed in the resistant cell
lines when the Chk1 inhibitor was combined with nontoxic concentrations of dasatinib, although the latter, as
single agent, did not show differences of activity between
the parental and the resistant JEKO-1 cells (Figure 5B
and Supplementary Figure 6A). When we investigated the
cytotoxicity to PF-00477736 in the presence of dasatinib
in the MCL cell line REC-1 with a primary resistance
to Chk1 inhibitors [24], no reversion of drug resistance
could be observed, suggesting that in this experimental
system other molecular mechanisms are taking place

PF-00477736 of MCL cell lines, we have isolated and
characterized a MCL cell line JEKO-1, resistant to the
Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736. The JEKO-1 R cell line was
seven times more resistant to PF-00477736 and crossresistant to another Chk1 inhibitor, AZD-7762, suggesting
that resistance was related to the inhibition of the target.
The JEKO-1 and JEKO-1 R cells were equally sensitive
to bendamustine and bortezomib, two chemotherapeutic
drugs commonly used in clinic for the treatment of MCL
[25], and to other DNA damaging agents implying that
the acquisition of the resistance to Chk1 inhibitors should
not be related to resistance to other chemotherapeutic
drugs. The DNA damage molecular marker γH2AX was
detected in JEKO-1 R at its IC50 (150 nM) but not at 15
nM (JEKO-1 parental IC50), suggesting that this cell line
acquired tolerance to treatment with the Chk1 inhibitor.
In addition, analysis of DNA fragmentation and caspase-3
activation suggests that PF-00477736 resistance in JEKO1 R is not due to inability to undergo apoptosis.
Interestingly, the JEKO-1 R cell line was also more
resistant to the Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775 than the JEKO1 parental cell line. This is an interesting and puzzling

result, considering that the inhibitors are target (Chk1
or Wee1) specific [9, 29]. It could be postulated that this
cross-resistance is related to the redundant roles played by
Wee1 and Chk1 in both the G1-S and G2-M transitions
and in ensuring a correct DNA replication [12], even if the
precise molecular mechanisms are to be defined.
When we analyzed the cell growth and cell cycle
progression in parental and resistant cells, we found
out that JEKO-1 R cell line has a shorter doubling time
and a faster S phase than JEKO-1 parental cell line. In
addition the markers of S phase, cyclin A and Cdt1, were
downregulated in the JEKO-1 R cell line as compared
to the parental cell line. Considering that the principal
MCL molecular feature is the t(11;14), which leads to
the overexpression of cyclin D1, and that our previous
data suggested its involvement in the Chk1 inhibitor PF00477736 sensitivity, we compared cyclin D1 expression
in the two cell lines, and found that it was downregulated
in the resistant cell line. The re-overexpression of cyclin
D1 in the JEKO-1 R cell lines led to a partial restoration
of the Chk1 inhibitor sensitivity, corroborating the
previous hypothesis of the possible involvement of

Figure 6: Model of Chk1 role in JEKO-1 parental and resistant cell line. A. JEKO-1 parental cells with the chromosomal

translocation t(11;14), have an enhanced G1-S transition due to cyclinD1 constitutive expression and are strongly dependent on Chk1
kinase which plays a crucial role in control of initiation of DNA replication and in the regulation of correct progression into S phase,
minimizing endogenous DNA damage. Thus Chk1 inhibition in JEKO-1 cell line leads to cell death B.. JEKO-1 R cells showed a decrease
in expression of cyclin D1 which correlates with a lower rate of G1-S transition, thus they became less dependent on Chk1 activation
for a correct initiation of DNA replication and progression into S phase which proceeds quicker in the resistant cell line. Chk1 is not
constitutively activated in JEKO-1 R cells and its inhibition is not lethal (see text).

Cyclin D1 overexpression in the high responsiveness
to Chk1 inhibitors. Constitutive expression of cyclin
D1 leads to an enhancement of the G1-S transition, due
to higher activity of the CDK4/6-cyclin D1 complex,
which, by phosphorylating Rb, induces the release of
E2F1 transcription factor and the consequent progression
of cells into S phase [4]. The G1-S transition and the
DNA replication progression is strongly controlled by
Chk1 [12], possibly explaining the high activity of Chk1
inhibitors in MCL. In the resistant cells the decrease in
cyclin D1 expression led to hypothesize that the activity
of the CDK4/6-cyclinD1 complex is less pronounced
and that the G1-S transition is less deregulated than the
parental cell line (Figure 6). This is in agreement with the
analysis of gene expression profile, showing that JEKO-1
R presented a lower expression of genes involved in cell
cycle progression and under the control of the transcription
factor E2F1 as compared to its parental cell line. Indeed, a
shorter S phase and a lower Chk1 basal activity suggested
that resistant cells were much less dependent on Chk1 than
parental ones. These observations could also explain the
increased resistance of JEKO-1 R cell line to the Wee1
inhibitor MK-1775. Wee1 plays a similar role to Chk1 in
the regulation of DNA replication progression, although
MCL cells rely more on Chk1 than on Wee1 activity [12,
24].
Genes belonging to pro-survival and proliferative
pathways were enriched in the resistant cell line. This was
somehow expected since treatment with Chk1 inhibitors
leads to activation of compensatory protective pathways
(MAPK, ERK) to neutralize the drugs cytotoxic effect and
this might contribute to resistance to Chk1 inhibitors. Due
to the observed high expression levels of FGR in JEKO-1
R, paired with additional members of the SRC pathway,
we evaluated whether the inhibition of SRC pathway with
a clinically available drug could overcome the resistance
to PF-00477736. Treatment with the dual SRC/ABLinhibitor dasatinib partly restored the drug sensitivity in the
resistant cell line, but had no effect on parental cell line,
suggesting that up-regulation of SRC and SRC-related
pathways, and of downstream survival pathways, could
be strictly associated with the resistance to Chk1 inhibitors
in MCL. This is in agreement with data available in the
literature showing in vitro and in vivo synergistic effect of
Chk1 and SRC inhibitors [30, 31]. In MM it was shown
that intact SRC kinase pathway is required for ERK1/2
activation and cytoprotective response after treatment with
Chk1 inhibitors. On the contrary disruption of SRC kinase
pathway, blocks Chk1 inhibitor induced activation of RasERK1/2 signaling cascade leading to potentiation of DNA
damage and activation of apoptosis. It will be worth in
the future to test other drugs specifically targeting survival
pathways (e.g. SRC-NFKB, RAS, MAPK pathways) in
combination with Chk1 inhibitors, since these pathways
may be responsible for a lower activity of Chk1 inhibitors
[31]. Along with this hypothesis, our previous analysis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

aimed at comparing basal gene expression profile in PF00477736 sensitive and resistant B cell lymphomas cell
lines, revealed an enrichment in NFKB and JAK/STAT
anti-apoptotic and pro survival pathways in the resistant
ones [24].
In conclusion, the isolation and characterization of
a mantle cell lymphoma cell line resistant to the Chk1
inhibitor PF-00477736 provided new mechanisms at the
basis of sensitivity/resistance to the inhibition of this
target. Specifically, we corroborated previous data on
the involvement of the t(11;14) in the activity of Chk1
inhibitors in MCL, further supporting the preclinical
evidence for the use of Chk1 inhibitors treatment as single
agents in MCL. Moreover, the information gained by gene
expression profile analysis suggested the possibility to
apply specific drug combination to overcome resistance to
Chk1 inhibitor, by interfering with pro-survival and antiapoptotic pathways.

initial cell number.
Starting from the measure of the absolute cell
number made by Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter) at
different times it is possible to calculate the TD, by fitting
the growth curve with a linear regression model and
calculating the angular coefficient (m) of the straight line:
ln(N(t)) = mt + ln(N0) with TD = ln(2)/m.
Supposing that cells can proliferate without
perturbations and considering negligible the intercellular
variation in the phase durations, the assessment of TD
and the measure of cell cycle percentages (%G1, %S and
%G2M), derived from flow cytometric analysis of DNA
distribution or biparametric staining of BrdUrd and DNA,
allows us to calculate the mean cell cycle phase durations
(TG1, TS e TG2M) by applying Steel’s formulae [36]:

Drugs treatment
Cell lines were seeded in the experimental setting
of 96 well plate and treated after 48 hrs with growing
concentrations of the different drugs. MTS assay,
performed 72-96 hrs after treatment, was used to measure
cell proliferation using a plate reader (Infinite M200,
TECAN). The IC50s of the compounds investigated for
the JEKO-1 and JEKO-1 R cell lines were calculated by
Calcusyn Software.

FACS-Analysis
To detect DNA by FACS, JEKO-1 and JEKO-1 R
cells were fixed 24 and 48 and 72 hr after seeding and
processed as already described [15]. Percentage of cell
cycle phases (G1-S-G2/M) of the two cell lines was
obtained analyzing DNA histograms with the previously
described software [32].

BrdUrd pulse-chase analysis

Caspase-3 activity assay

Cell cycle differences between JEKO-1 and
JEKO-1 R cells were further investigated using
2’-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) pulse-chase analysis.
BrdUrd (Sigma) replaces thymidine during DNA
synthesis, thus BrdUrd pulse labeling (20 min labeling
with 20 µM BrdUrd added on exponential growing
cells) catches S-phase cells engaged in DNA synthesis
at that time [33]. Analysis at 7 hr post-labeling detects
their movement through the S phase and the outflow of
unlabeled cells from G1 and G2/M. The relative movement
(RM), defined as the average DNA content of undivided
BrdUrd-positive cells in a scale from 0 (DNA content of
G1 cells) to 1 (DNA content of G2/M cells), allows us
to appreciate DNA synthesis rate with the consequent
evaluation of S phase duration [34]. About 2x106 cells
were fixed in ethanol 70% and staining and biparametric
analysis were done as previously described [35]. For each
sample we acquired 10,000 events with a FACS Calibur
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) flow cytometer.

Caspase-3 activity was measured by enzymatic
assay using a fluorogenic substrate for caspase-3, AcDEVD-AMC (acetyl Asp-Glu-Val-Asp 7-amido-4methylcoumarin) as already described [21].

Two-parameter flow cytometry analysis DNA
content and FITC-conjugated dUTP
DNA fragmentation in JEKO-1 and JEKO-1 R cells
treated with the same concentration and with an equitoxic
dose of the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 (15 nM and 150
nM respectively) was detected at 24 and 72 hr of treatment
by the TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling technique
(TUNEL), following a procedure already described [21].

Analysis of gene expression and real time PCR
RNA was extracted by using Maxwell 16LEV
simplyRNA Cells kit (Promega). RNA was retrotranscribed to cDNA using High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystem). Optimal
primer pairs were chosen for each gene of interest using
PRIMER-3 software (Supplementary Table 4). Differences
in gene expression were determined by real time RT-PCR
performed with Sybr Green PCR master mix (Applied

Biosystem) and the curve of dissociation was evaluated
for each gene. Samples were then normalized using the
expression of the housekeeping gene (actin) and their
levels were compared to control samples. Real-time PCR
was done using the 7900HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems).
Gene expression profiling was done using the
HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA) as previously reported [37]. Data were
first extracted with the Illumina GenomeStudio software
and then imported in the Partek Genomics Suite 6.4 and
quantile normalized. Functional annotation was performed
using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) tool
using the GSEA C2 and, C3.tft collections [38] and the
SignatureDB gene-sets collection [39]. Raw data will
be available at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo) database.

particles was resuspended in PBS and was used to infect
JEKO-1 R cells. The day after the infection the marker
of selection puromycin was added to the cells. After
some passages virus titer was evaluated by using the LV
Lentiviral Titer qRT-PCR (MoBiTec) in order to be able
to safely manipulate the cell culture once the titer reached
non-detectable levels.

Flow cytometric analysis of GFP content
To quantify the efficiency of the lentiviral infection
% of GFP positive cells was monitored by FACS.
Cells were detached and re-suspended in PBS for flow
cytometric analysis. For each samples we acquired
at least 10,000 events on a 256-channel scale using a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). GFP
fluorescence was detected in FL1 (530 ± 30 nm) with
a logarithmic amplifier. Dead cells were excluded from
the analysis by propidium iodide (PI) staining. For this
purpose 1 µg/ml PI in PBS was added to cell suspensions
5 min before flow cytometric analysis. Cells could be
divided into different populations: PI impermeable
(viable) and PI permeable (dead cells). PI fluorescence
was detected in the fluorescence channel FL3 (>670 nm)
using a logarithmic amplifier. To increase the fluorescence
intensity the concentration of puromycin was increased
from 1 µg/ml to 6µg/ml.

Western blotting analysis
Proteins were extracted and visualized using
standard techniques, and as already described [15].
Primary anti Chk1 (G4), cyclin D1, Cdt1, actin and
ß-tubulin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Primary anti pS317-Chk1, was purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology. The mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin
A is from BD Transduction Laboratories. The anti γH2AX
antibody is from Millipore.
