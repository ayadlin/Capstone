transcription factors directly involved in cisplatin resistance (1).
YB-1 is an important molecule for brain development and nullmutant mice show embryonic lethality (6, 7). YB-1 has been
proposed to possess various biological activities in both nucleus
and cytoplasm (8). YB-1 expression closely correlates with cell
proliferation and is up-regulated in both proliferating adult tissues
and cancer cells. It is well known that YB-1 overexpression is
closely associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome (8, 9). We
have previously shown that several E-boxes are located in the
YB-1 promoter (10). YB-1 expression is induced by cisplatin and
is regulated by the E-box–binding transcription factor c-Myc
(11). YB-1 is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells but c-Myc
expression is down-regulated in these cells, suggesting that other
E-box–binding transcription factors might participate in YB-1
expression.
Among E-box–binding transcription factors, Twist belongs to
the family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. Twist
inhibits the p53-mediated response to cellular stress (12). Twist
shows vague sequence recognition and binds to the nucleotide
sequence 5¶-CANNTG-3¶. Several binding sites are present in the
core promoter of the YB-1 gene. Here, we show that YB-1 is a
target gene of Twist and that Twist is overexpressed in cisplatinresistant cells. We also show that knockdown of either YB-1 or
Twist expression can induce cell cycle arrest, and YB-1 is a major
downstream target of Twist.
These results contribute to the elucidation of the roles of both
YB-1 and Twist in tumor progression and suggest that these
proteins may represent promising molecular targets for cancer
chemotherapy.

Abstract
YB-1 controls gene expression through both transcriptional
and translational mechanisms and is involved in various
biological activities such as brain development, chemoresistance, and tumor progression. We have previously shown that
YB-1 is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells and is
involved in resistance against DNA-damaging agents. Structural analysis of the YB-1 promoter reveals that several Eboxes may participate in the regulation of YB-1 expression.
Here, we show that the E-box–binding transcription factor
Twist is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells and that
YB-1 is a target gene of Twist. Silencing of either Twist or
YB-1 expression induces G1 phase cell cycle arrest of tumor
cell growth. Significantly, reexpression of YB-1 led to increase
colony formation when Twist expression was down-regulated
by small interfering RNA. However, cotransfection of Twist
expression plasmid could not increase colony formation
when YB-1 expression was down-regulated. Collectively, these
data suggest that YB-1 is a major downstream target of Twist.
Both YB-1 and Twist expression could induce tumor
progression, promoting cell growth and driving oncogenesis
in various cancers. Thus, both YB-1 and Twist may represent
promising molecular targets for cancer therapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cisplatin is widely used in the treatment of many solid tumors.
Cisplatin can induce oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress,
and DNA-damaging stress, leading to the activation of multiple
signal transduction pathways. These are involved in mediating
cisplatin-induced apoptosis and exert antitumor activities. Thus,
the mechanisms by which cancer cells can develop cisplatin
resistance can be complex. Cisplatin resistance arises through
multiple mechanisms, such as decreased accumulation of cisplatin,
inactivation of cisplatin by glutathione conjugation, and increased
DNA repair activity. However, little is known about the relationships and interactions among these mechanisms. To resolve and
elucidate these complex mechanisms as a whole, we have started to
identify the critical transcription-related factors and their interacting partners (1).
We have reported that several transcription factors are upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells, including YB-1 (2), ATF4 (3),
Clock (4), and ZNF143 (5). These have been reported to be

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human epidermoid cancer KB cells and human prostate
cancer PC3 cells were cultured in Eagle’s MEM. Human breast cancer
MCF7 cells were cultured in DMEM. These media were purchased from
Nissui Seiyaku and contained 10% fetal bovine serum. The cisplatinresistant KB/CP4 and P/CDP6 cells were derived from KB and PC3 cells as
previously described (3) and found to be f23- to 63-fold more resistant to
cisplatin than their parental cells (3). Human dermal fibroblasts were
purchased from Cell Applications, Inc., and cultured in fibroblast basal
medium (Cell Applications). Cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2
atmosphere at 37jC.
Antibodies. Antibodies against signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3), Clock, and Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti-Flag (M2) antibody, anti-Flag (M2) affinity gel, and
anti–h-actin (AC-15) antibody were purchased from Sigma. Anti-YB-1
antibody was prepared as previously described (2).
Plasmid construction. To obtain the full-length cDNA for Twist, PCR
was carried out on a SuperScript cDNA library (Invitrogen) using the
following primer pair: 5¶-ATGATGCAGGACGTGTCCAGCT-3¶ and 5¶CTAGTGGGACGCGGACATGGACC-3¶. The PCR product was cloned into
the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). For construction of pcDNA3-Flag-Twist,

plates. The following day, the indicated concentrations of the drugs were
applied. After 72 h, the surviving cells were stained with TetraColor ONE
(Seikagaku Corporation) for 90 min at 37jC. The absorbance was then
measured at 450 nm.
Cell proliferation assay. PC3, MCF7, or human dermal fibroblast cells
(2.5  104) were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with siRNA as
described above. Twelve hours after transfection was set to 0 h. The cells
were harvested with trypsin and counted daily with a Coulter-type cell size
analyzer (CDA-500, Sysmex).
Flow cytometry. PC3 or MCF7 cells (2.5  105) were seeded in six-well
plates, transfected with siRNA, and cultured for 72 h. The cells were

vector (Invitrogen). The construction of pcDNA3-Flag-YB-1 has previously
been described (13).
The core promoter and partial first exon (661 to +78) of the wild-type
YB-1 gene were amplified by PCR using placenta DNA and the primer pair
5¶-AGATCTCTATCACGTGGCTGTTGC-3¶ and 5¶-AAGCTTATCAGTCCTCCATTCTCATTGG-3¶. PCR was also done to introduce the E-box mutations
into the YB-1 promoter using the following primer pairs: MT, 5¶-AGATCTCTATCAGCTGGCTGTTGC-3¶ and 5¶-AAGCTTATCAGTCCTCCATTCTCATTGG-3¶; MM, 5¶-AGATCTCTATACCGGTGCTGTTGC-3¶ and 5¶-AAGCTTATCAGTCCTCCATTCTCATTGG-3¶; M1, 5¶-AGATCTCTATACCGTGGCTGTTGC-3¶ and 5¶-AAGCTTATCAGTCCTCCATTCTCATTGG-3¶; and M2,
5¶-AGATCTCTATACACGGTCTGTTGC-3¶ and 5¶-AAGCTTATCAGTCCTCCATTCTCATTGG-3¶. Underlined nucleotides indicate a wild-type E-box
and mutated E-boxes. These PCR products were cloned and ligated into the
BglII-HindIII sites of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega).
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done as previously
described (4, 5) with antibodies for STAT3 (1:1,000), Clock (1:1,000), Twist
(1:500), Flag (M2; 1:5,000), and h-actin (1:10,000).
Knockdown analysis using small interfering RNAs. The following
double-stranded RNA 25-bp oligonucleotides were commercially generated
(Invitrogen): Clock small interfering RNA (siRNA), 5¶-UAAAGUCUGUUGUUGUAUCAUGUGC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-GCACAUGAUACAACAACAGACUUUA-3¶
(antisense); Twist siRNA #1, 5¶-UUGAGGGUCUGAAUCUUGCUCAGCU-3¶

PC3 or MCF7 cells (1  106) were
transfected with siRNA as previously described (4, 5). Aliquots of
2.5  104, 2.5  105, 3  102, or 2.5  103 cells were used in cell proliferation
assays, flow cytometry, colony formation assays, or WST-8 assay, respectively,
as described in the following sections. The remaining cells were seeded
in 100-mm dishes with 10 mL of culture medium and harvested after 72 h of
culture for Western blot analysis as described earlier.
Luciferase assay. Transient transfection and a luciferase assay were
done. Cells were cotransfected with the indicated amounts of YB-1 reporter
plasmid and expression plasmids using Superfect reagent (Qiagen); 48 h
posttransfection, a luciferase assay was done as previously described (4, 5).
The results shown are normalized to protein concentration measured using
the Bradford method and are representative of at least three independent
experiments.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done as previously described (4, 5). Briefly, PC3 cells
were transiently transfected with Flag or Flag-Twist plasmid and cultured for
48 h as described above. Soluble chromatin from 1  106 cells was incubated
with 2 Ag of anti-Flag (M2) affinity gel or antimouse immunoglobulin G
(IgG). Purified DNA was dissolved in 20 AL of distilled water and 2 AL of DNA
were used for PCR analysis with the following primer pairs: YB-1 #1 (2,112
to 1,730), 5¶-ATTAAGCAGGCAAAGAGGAAGG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶GTGGTTTACTGGACTCTATGAC-3¶ (reverse); YB-1 #2 (1,708 to 1,329),

Results
Twist is up-regulated in cisplatin-resistant cells and
regulates YB-1 gene expression. We have previously shown that
YB-1 is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells. Because several
E-boxes are found in the promoter region of the YB-1 gene, we

to Twist expression. These data indicate that E-box sequences (i.e.,
5¶-CANNTG-3¶) contribute to the activation of transcription by
Twist, which is also supported by previous report (14). To
determine if the transcription activation of Twist on the YB-1
promoter was a result of direct recruitment of Twist to the
promoter, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
covering different segments of the promoter and 5¶ end of the YB-1
gene. We tried this assay using a commercial antibody against
Twist, but it did not work well. Subsequently, transient transfection
of human prostate cancer PC3 cells with a Flag-tagged Twist
expression plasmid was used. Forty-eight hours after transfection, a
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done with an anti-Flag
antibody. When control primers from irrelevant Rad51 gene
promoter were used, no binding of Twist was observed in Rad51
gene promoter (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2C, we found that Twist
was present in three segments; 1,708/1,329, 892/422, and
664/+77 bp. These results indicate that E-boxes in the proximal
promoter region are the target of Twist binding in vivo.
Knockdown of Twist expression sensitizes cells to cisplatin.
It has been shown that YB-1 expression is involved in cellular
sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (2, 7). To determine whether
Twist also contributes to the cytotoxic effect of anticancer agents,
cells were initially exposed to a range of concentration of
anticancer agents in the presence or absence of siRNA against
Twist. Knockdown of Twist expression sensitizes cells to cisplatin
but not to etoposide and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; Fig. 3).

first examined the level of expression of E-box binding proteins. A
number of transcription factors have been shown to bind to
E-boxes. The expression of the circadian transcription factor Clock,
but not that of c-Myc or the upstream stimulatory factor 1, was upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells (4). Initially, we examined
whether Clock is responsible for the transcriptional regulation of
the YB-1 gene. However, YB-1 expression was unaffected by the
down-regulation of Clock (Fig. 1A). Then, the expression of another
E-box binding protein, Twist, was examined. We found that Twist
expression was significantly up-regulated in two cisplatin-resistant
cells that were independently isolated (Fig. 1B). This prompted us
to test the hypothesis that Twist might affect YB-1 gene expression.
We verified the existence of a relationship between YB-1 expression
and Twist expression using two different siRNAs targeting different
regions of Twist. Inactivation of Twist was shown to suppress YB-1
expression (Fig. 1C).
To determine whether the YB-1 expression was due to E-box–
dependent transcriptional activation, we analyzed the activity of
the YB-1 promoter region as well as several constructs containing
E-box mutations (Fig. 2A). PC3 cells ectopically expressing Twist
showed an f4-fold increase in luciferase activity driven by YB-1WT-Luc containing a wild-type E-box (CACGTG; Fig. 2B). In
addition, PC3 cells cotransfected with Twist expression plasmids
and the YB-1-MT-Luc construct containing a mutated E-box
(CAGCTG) also displayed a 4-fold higher level of luciferase activity.
However, three E-box mutants (MM, M1, and M2) did not respond

YB-1 are essential mediators of growth regulation in cancer cells.
Further, we used primary human fibroblasts to examine the
molecular basis of both YB-1 and Twist in cellular proliferation.
Murine embryonic fibroblasts from YB-1–null mouse embryo
showed greatly reduced proliferation (6). Western blot analysis
showed that Twist and YB-1 protein levels were significantly
decreased on transfection of siRNAs targeting Twist and YB-1,
respectively (Fig. 5A). Knockdown of Twist again decreased the
YB-1 expression in primary fibroblasts. We found that knockdown
of Twist and YB-1 resulted in the inhibition of cellular proliferation
(Fig. 5B and C).
YB-1 is a major downstream target of Twist. To assess
whether YB-1 expression modulates the growth of cancer cell that
was transfected with siRNA for Twist, we then carried out colony
formation assays. About 20% to 30% reduction of colony forming
activity was observed in the cells treated with either YB-1 or Twist

Down-regulation of both Twist and YB-1 induces G1 arrest
and decreases cell proliferation. To get further insight into the
biological relevance of both Twist and YB-1, we analyzed their
effect on the proliferation of PC3 and MCF7 cells. When Twist
expression was knocked down by transfection of cells with a Twistspecific siRNA, growth retardation was induced in both PC3 and
MCF7 cells (Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed when YB-1
expression was down-regulated (Fig. 4B). To understand the
implications of this growth retardation, cells were treated with
siRNA and assayed for DNA content at 72 h posttransfection by
laser scanning flow cytometry (Fig. 4C and D). The silencing of
either Twist or YB-1 expression led to a significant and
reproducible increase in the proportion of PC3 and MCF7 cells in
the G1 fraction. Furthermore, we observed a substantial increase in
the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 fraction. These data are
consistent with previous reports (12, 15). Thus, both Twist and

neural tube morphogenesis in mice (6). Like YB-1–null mice,
Twist-null embryos also exhibit failure of neural tube closure (20),
suggesting that YB-1 might be a major target gene of Twist. We
have also confirmed that there are several E-boxes in the
promoter region of the mouse YB-1 gene (data not shown),
suggesting that Twist also regulates YB-1 expression in mice. In
clinical studies, the level of YB-1 expression has been shown to
correlate with tumor growth and prognosis (8, 9). Although there

siRNA (Fig. 6A and B). Cotransfection of YB-1 expression plasmid
increased the colony number to f90% of that in the control. Thus,
YB-1 reexpression almost completely rescued Twist siRNA–induced
growth arrest. However, cotransfection of Twist expression plasmid
could not rescue YB-1 siRNA–induced growth arrest. Western blot
analysis confirmed that siRNA and expression plasmids functioned
properly in these experiments (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that
YB-1 is a major downstream target of Twist and necessary for cell
growth.

Discussion
The Y-box–binding protein family contains a cold shock domain,
which is a highly conserved nucleic acid binding domain (8, 9).
Y-box proteins are multifunctional and are involved in both
transcription and translation (8, 9, 16). YB-1 promotes cell
proliferation through the transactivation of target genes such as
proliferating cell nuclear antigen, epidermal growth factor receptor,
DNA topoisomerase II, thymidine kinase, and DNA polymerase a
(1). We have previously reported that YB-1 functions as a positive
transcription factor to activate human multidrug resistance 1 in
response to various environmental stimuli (8, 9). YB-1 is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells (2, 8, 9) and is involved in brain
development (6). The transcriptional regulation of Y-box proteins
is poorly understood. We have also characterized the structure and
function of the promoter of two Y-box proteins, YB-1 (10) and
Contrin/dbpC. Interestingly, E-boxes are found in the promoter
regions of both genes. Among E-box–binding proteins, Clock has
been found to be overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells (4).
However, YB-1 expression is not affected by the knockdown of
Clock expression with siRNA (Fig. 1A). We found that another
E-box binding protein, Twist, is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant
cells (Fig. 1B) and positively regulates YB-1 expression (Fig. 1C).
Both reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays clearly
showed that Twist positively regulated YB-1 gene expression
(Fig. 2). Using whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays, Twist
was also found to be overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant ovarian
cancer cells (17). Functional analysis of Twist provides considerable
insight into the epigenetics of cisplatin-resistance. Twist depletion in cells using siRNA confers sensitivity to cisplatin but not
to etoposide and 5-FU (Fig. 3). These results correspond to the
previous reports that YB-1 depletion in cells confers sensitivity to
DNA-damaging agents (2, 7).
Twist has been suggested to be a potential oncogene interfering
with p53-related pathways (11). We have shown that siRNAmediated YB-1 knockdown results in reduced cell growth (6).
Inactivation of Twist expression was sufficient to provoke massive
apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines (15). We have also found
that siRNA-mediated Twist knockdown results in complete
inhibition of the proliferation not only of cancer cell lines but
also of primary cultured cells (Figs. 4 and 5). Fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis also showed that silencing
of Twist expression by siRNA induces G1 arrest and apoptosis
(Fig. 4C and D). Further, cotransfection of YB-1 expression
plasmid can rescue the Twist siRNA–induced growth arrest
(Fig. 6A and B), suggesting that YB-1 is a major downstream
target gene of Twist. Twist was discovered as a Drosophila gene
whose mutation causes the TWISTED phenotype in embryos
(18). In humans, Twist germ-line mutations and reduced Twist
expression are responsible for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (19).
Interestingly, we have reported that YB-1 is required for cranial

Figure 6. YB-1 rescues Twist siRNA–
induced growth arrest. A, PC3 cells were
transfected with indicated amount of
siRNA and expression plasmid. Columns,
mean of at least three independent
experiments; bars, SD. The number
of colonies transfected with control
siRNA and Flag vector corresponded
to 100%. **, P < 0.001. B, representative
plates treated with indicated siRNA
and expression plasmid. C, PC3 cells
were transfected with siRNA and
expression plasmid. Whole-cell extracts
(50 Ag for Flag and 20 Ag for YB-1)
and nuclear extracts (100 Ag for Twist)
were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and
Western blot analysis was done with
corresponding antibodies.

In summary, we have identified that YB-1 is a major target gene
of Twist and that YB-1 expression is required for tumor cell growth.
This functional link between YB-1 and Twist suggests that Twist
and its downstream effector YB-1 will provide promising molecular
targets for the treatment of various human cancers.

is no sufficient evidence to indicate the role of Twist in human
cancers, it will be important to examine whether Twist expression correlates with YB-1 expression. The serine/threonine kinase
AKT/protein kinase B has been shown to play a key role in cell
proliferation. AKT2 is a Twist target gene and a functional
mediator of Twist as well as YB-1 (21). AKT1 has recently been
shown to promote YB-1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (22). Based on these reports, Twist can regulate the expression of both YB-1 and AKT2 and might be involved in promoting
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Twist regulates
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and is involved in tumor
metastasis. It has been shown that inhibition of Twist expression
in highly metastatic cells suppresses their metastatic ability (23).
This indicates that Twist expression might correlate with
malignant progression and prognosis.
