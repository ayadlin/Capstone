ABSTRACT
Radiotherapy is a mainstay for treatment of many human cancer types, including
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Thereby, it is clinically very relevant
to understand the mechanisms determining radioresistance. Here, we identify CIP2A
as an Oct4 target gene and provide evidence that they co-operate in radioresistance.
Oct4 positively regulates CIP2A expression both in testicular cancer cell lines as
well as in embryonic stem cells. To expand the relevance of these findings we show
that Oct4 and CIP2A are co-expressed in CD24 positive side-population of patientderived HNSCC cell lines. Most importantly, all Oct4 positive HNSCC patient samples
were CIP2A positive and this double positivity was linked to poor differentiation
level, and predicted for decreased patient survival among radiotherapy treated HNSCC
patients. Oct4 and CIP2A expression was also linked with increased aggressiveness
and radioresistancy in HNSCC cell lines. Together we demonstrate that CIP2A is a
novel Oct4 target gene in stem cells and in human cancer cell lines. Clinically these
results suggest that diagnostic evaluation of HNSCC tumors for Oct4 or Oct4/CIP2A
positivity might help to predict HNSCC tumor radioresistancy. These results also
identify both Oct4 and CIP2A as potential targets for radiosensitation.

HNSCC cells. Therefore, despite of recent advancements
in adjuvant therapies and imaging modalities, the overall
prognosis of advanced HNSCC has not improved
significantly; the five-year overall survival among these
patients is approximately 50% [2]. Recently, many
different approaches have been introduced to clarify the
cause of HNSCC aggressiveness and poor patient survival.
These include mutation analyses [3–5], locoregional
diversity of HNSCC cancers [6] and mechanisms of
radio/chemosensitivity [7, 8]. Moreover, features linked
to cancer stem cells, such as self-renewal and pluripotency

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck cancer is the 6th most common cancer
worldwide and 90% of these cancers are diagnosed as
HNSCCs (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, [1]).
Surgery is the traditional and sufficient treatment of small
and local HNSCC tumors. In order to achieve a better
locoregional control in advanced HNSCC tumors, surgery
is generally combined with chemoradiotherapy. However,
it is generally acknowledged that one of the major barriers
for successful HNSCC treatment is high radioresistance of

have also been hypothesized to be one explanation for
the aggressiveness and therapy resistancy of HNSCCs
[9, 10]. Despite these activities, the mechanisms behind
recurrency of HNSCC cancers after adjuvant therapies are
still poorly understood. This has prevented development
of diagnostic methods for stratification of patients having
more aggressive subtypes of HNSCCs for more aggressive
therapies and thus potentially better clinical outcome.
Also, identification of mechanisms behind radioresistancy
of HNSCC cells might provide novel opportunities for
radiosensitation of HNSCC cells.
Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) is
highly expressed in embryonic germ, stem, and testicular
cancer cells [11, 12]. In embryonic stem (ES) cells Oct4
has a critical function in self-renewal and differentiation by
regulating the pluripotent potential of these cells [13, 14].
Recent studies have suggested that Oct4 is also expressed
in many other tumours than those of embryonal or
testicular origin, such as HNSCC, breast and lung cancers
[15–18]. Moreover in recent studies, increased Oct4
expression in cancers has been linked to cancer stem cell
phenotype [19], radioresistancy [20] and poor prognosis
of cancer patients [21, 22] although Oct4 link to cancer
aggressiveness seems to be somewhat controversial [23].
Many known Oct4 target genes are directly involved in
stemness regulation of normal and cancerous cells, but we
know much less about potential targets of Oct4 that could
regulate other characteristics of aggressive growth such as
proliferation, apoptosis resistance or senescence evasion.
Moreover, to date, the target genes regulated by Oct4 in
HNSCCs are not known.
Cancerous Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase
2A (CIP2A) is an oncogene that inhibits the tumour
suppressor PP2A in many different cancers, including
HNSCCs [24–26]. Several recent studies have shown
that increased CIP2A promotes malignant cell growth,
in vivo tumour formation [25, 26]. Clinically, high
CIP2A expression correlates with worsened patient
survival in more than dozen different cancer types
[25]. Linked to its function as an inhibitor of PP2A, a
master regulator of cellular signaling, CIP2A expression
promotes various cancer driver pathways and thus many
aspects of aggressive cell growth such as proliferation,
apoptosis resistance or senescence evasion [27, 28].
Importantly, CIP2A is expressed at very low level
in other normal tissues than testis, and its systematic
inhibition do not cause detrimental consequences to
normal mouse development and viability [28, 29].
However, CIP2A-deficient mice do show decreased
Her2-driven mammary tumor development [28].
Therefore inhibition of CIP2A may have clinical
relevance in development of future cancer therapies. In
our recent work we demonstrated that CIP2A is highly
expressed in testicular stem cells and has a role in
regulation of spermatogonial progenitor proliferation.
Moreover, spermatogonial cells isolated from CIP2A
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutant mice showed reduced expression of Plzf
(promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger) and other stem
cell renewal-associated genes, suggesting a role for
CIP2A in testicular stem and progenitor cells. However,
the functional relationship between CIP2A and stem
cell renewal genes, such as Oct4 is not clear. Also, the
potential role for CIP2A in mediating radioresistancy of
HNSCCs has not been addressed thus far.
In this work we identify a novel function for
stem cell regulator Oct4 in regulating oncoprotein
CIP2A expression. Functionally, we demonstrate
that Oct4/CIP2A double positivity is associated with
radioresistancy in both normal spermatogonial cells,
as well as in HNSCC. Clinically these results suggest
that diagnostic evaluation of HNSCC tumors for Oct4
or Oct4/CIP2A positivity might help to predict HNSCC
tumor radioresistancy.

RESULTS
Oct4 and CIP2A are expressed in radioresistant
cell population in the mouse testis
Previous studies have demonstrated that testicular
stem cells (spermatogonia) contain great pluripotent
capacity and mimic in many ways embryonic stem cells
[30, 31]. CIP2A is expressed in testicular stem cell/
progenitor population (Fig. 1A) and our recent results
suggest that CIP2A promotes self-renewal of normal
testicular spermatogonia expressing Oct4 and Plzf [29].
To study whether CIP2A is expressed in the radioresistant
stem cell population, we used a novel approach to
identify the spermatogonial genes involved in stemness
based on their expression profiles in response to in vivo
irradiation [32]. To avoid systemic side-effects, mouse
testes were X-irradiated with 4 Gy under CT-scan
guidance (Fig. 1B; [32]). Changes in gene expression
profiles in response to in vivo irradiation were studied
as a function of time. Spermatogonial genes that did
not show inhibition of expression were considered to
be expressed in radioresistant spermatogonial stem
cells [32]. Expression of stra8 and c-Kit, which are
markers of more differentiated spermatogonia [33–35],
expectedly collapsed in response to 4Gy X-irradiation
(Fig. 1C). However, expression of Oct4 or CIP2A did
not significantly change over the 144-hour observation
period (Fig. 1C), whereas the spermatogonial markers
Plzf and CD9 showed a strong increase at 96 and
144 hours after irradiation, coinciding with increased
proliferation and repopulation of the spermatogonia.
Regarding CIP2A and Stra8 these results were confirmed
by immunohistochemical staining of testis samples 144
hours after irradiation (Supplementary Figure 1). These
results indicate that expression of both CIP2A and Oct4 is
linked to cellular radioresistance in vivo.

was deleted (Fig. 2G, -1802ΔCIP2ALuc). As shown in
Figure 2I, deletion of putative Oct4 binding sites decreased
the promoter activity of -1802CIP2ALuc significantly
(p = 0.021). However, the inhibition did not fully reach the
level of inhibition observed by Oct4 RNAi (Fig. 2I red line),
indicating that additional Oct4 binding sites, or sites through
which Oct4 increases CIP2A transcription co-operatively
with other transcription factors, may exist downstream of
the identified region mutated here.
Results above identify CIP2A as a novel Oct4 target
gene in testicular cancer cells. To clarify whether similar
regulatory pathway between Oct4 and CIP2A exists also
in embryonic stem cells, we adopted a widely used murine
ES cell model (Zhbtc4; [32, 38]) in which Oct4 can be
conditionally downregulated by doxycycline treatment.
Similarly to TC cell lines, in mES cells Oct4 downregulation
is accompanied by a decrease in CIP2A levels (Fig. 2J).
Increased phosphorylation of transcription factor MYC at
serine 62 is a hallmark of CIP2A function in cancer cells
[25]. To test whether Oct4 depletion resulted in functional
outcome of CIP2A inhibition, we studied pS62MYC
expression after Oct4 siRNA treatment. Importantly, Oct4
depletion resulted in potent inhibition of expression of
both CIP2A and pS62MYC (Fig. 2K). Consistent with
the post-translation mechanism by which CIP2A regulates
MYC phosphorylation [39], and with previously published
results [24, 40], no effects on c-myc mRNA expression was
observed by Oct4 siRNA (data not shown).
To study whether Oct4 and CIP2A are co-expressed
in vivo in a cancer type that is characterized by stem
cell–like cell growth, twenty TC patient samples were
subjected to immunohistochemical staining with specific
CIP2A and Oct4 antibodies [24, 41]. In addition, MYC
and ki67 expression were also analysed. All studied
testicular cancers were positive for Oct4 and ki67
(Fig. 3 and Table 1). Only 1/20 of Oct4 and ki67 positive
TC samples did not show co-expression with CIP2A
(Fig. 3 and Table 1). Oct4 and CIP2A co-expression with
MYC in TCs was also very obvious and only two cancer
samples were MYC negative (Table 1).
Together these results demonstrate that CIP2A is
a novel Oct4 target gene in normal and malignant stem
cell-like cells, and that they are co-expressed in vivo in
testicular cancers with characteristics of stem cell–like
cell growth. As their regulation is unidirectional, and
CIP2A does not regulate either Oct4 or Nanog, it is
likely that CIP2A does not regulate stemness of TC cells.
Instead CIP2A regulation by Oct4 may expand Oct4
functions to regulation of CIP2A-dependent processes
such as regulation of oncogenic MYC phosphorylation,
proliferation and apoptosis resistance.

Results above, together with our previous results
[29] indicate that CIP2A expression is linked to expression
of Oct4 in normal mammalian progenitor cells. However,
these studies have not yet addressed whether these genes
regulate each other’s expression. Testicular cancer (TC) is a
good model to study regulatory mechanisms related to cell
stemness [36]. To further study the possible link between
CIP2A and Oct4 we used two different TC cell lines derived
from either seminoma (Tcam2) or embryonal carcinoma
(Tera1). When CIP2A siRNA was used in Tcam2 and Tera1
cells, an effective downregulation in CIP2A protein levels
was detected, whereas neither Oct4 nor Nanog levels were
affected (Fig. 2A). Similar results were seen when ES cells
originating from CIP2A hypomorphic blastocyst were
studied. Even though CIP2A expression levels in CIP2A
hypomorphic ES cells were below the level of detection,
Nanog and Oct4 levels were not significantly decreased
(Supplementary Fig. 2). These data suggest that CIP2A is
not an upstream regulator of Oct4.
To test whether Oct4 instead regulate CIP2A, we
performed parallel transfection of siCIP2A, and siOct4 in
Tcam2 cell line. Importantly, two independent Oct4 siRNAs
were found to potently inhibit CIP2A protein expression
(Fig. 2B, C). Suggestive of functional relevance, the
downregulation of CIP2A expression by Oct4 RNAi was
even further pronounced after 5 days (Fig. 2D). To study
the molecular mechanism by which Oct4 regulates CIP2A
expression, we examined CIP2A mRNA regulation in cells
transfected with either Oct4 or CIP2A siRNA. Both siRNAs
potently inhibited CIP2A mRNA expression (Fig. 2E), and
as was observed at the protein level, CIP2A inhibition did
not affect Oct4 expression (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, consistent
with function of Oct4 as a transcription factor, a luciferase
promoter assay, using previously characterized  -1802
bp fragment of CIP2A promoter [37], demonstrated that
Oct4 regulates CIP2A expression at the promoter level
(Fig. 2F). Importantly, bioinformatics analysis of -1802
bp promoter fragment identified putative octamer binding
elements at region -1650 to -1600 (Fig. 2G red box, and
Supplementary Fig. 3). To map whether these sites could
mediate CIP2A promoter activity in Oct4 positive Tcam2
cells, we used a shorter CIP2A promoter fragment in
which the putative Oct4 binding region is absent (Fig. 2G).
Importantly, as compared to 1802 bp promoter fragment,
this shorter 865 bp fragment displayed significantly
decreased promoter activity ( p =  0.021; Fig.  2H).
Interestingly, previous study using human gastric cancer
cells demonstrated that the 865 bp promoter fragment had
even increased activity as compared to 1802 bp fragment
[37], suggesting that the observed effect might be related
to stem-like characteristics of Tcam2 cells. To directly
assess the contribution of putative Oct4 binding sites in the
context of 1802 fragment, we cloned a mutant version of
the -1802CIP2ALuc in which the region -1650 to -1600

protein and mRNA expression. HNSCC was selected based
on previous validation of CIP2A as an HNSCC oncoprotein
[24, 42], and suggested importance of Oct4 and other
stem cell regulators in the therapy resistance of HNSCCs
[22, 43, 44]. Notably, all studied patient-derived HNSCC
cell lines expressed CIP2A and Oct4 proteins (Fig.  4A).
However, as compared to TC cell lines (Tera1, Tcam2), Oct4
expression levels were clearly lower in HNSCC cell lines,
which is in line with the true stem cell characteristics of TCs.
Next we recorded the mRNA expression levels of CIP2A
and Oct4 in 15 different patient-derived HNSCC cell lines.

In this analysis, statistically significant co-expression
correlation existed between CIP2A and Oct4 expression
( p = 0.0049; Fig.  4B). Importantly correlation between
CIP2A and Oct4 expression was specific to this gene pair
as no correlation was observed between CIP2A and Nanog
expression ( p = 0.286; Fig. 4C).
Oct4 is expressed in several cancer types and
its expression has been linked with increased cancer
cell stemness and tumorigenicity [12, 17, 21]. Role of

regulated gene (Fig. 2), suggests that CIP2A might also
be expressed in cancer stem cell like cells, however
this has not been studied as yet. To study the nature of
cell population in which Oct4 and CIP2A might be
co-expressed in patient-derived HNSCC cells, three
cell lines were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) experiment based on their cell surface
CD24+/CD44+ double positivity. CD24+/CD44+ double
positivity was indicated recently to potentially mark for
HNSCC cell population with stem cell like characteristics
[45]. Also HNSCC patients with CD24 and CD44
double-positive cells showed the lowest overall survival
rates [46]. Importantly, CIP2A has been shown to drive
in vivo tumorigenesis and MYC expression in two of the
studied cell lines, UT-SCC7 and UT-SCC9 [24], and all
three cell lines do contain a population of cells that have
characteristics of stem cell like cells as they are able to
form spheres in serum free medium in low attachment
plates (Sittig et al., unpublished results).
Cell sorting experiment revealed that all cell lines
were 100% positive for CD44, which is in line with
recent data that CD44 is expressed almost ubiquitously
in HNSCC cells in culture [46]. Instead, CD24+/CD44+
double positivity did select for a side population of cells
with frequency varying from 11% to 70% depending
on the cell line (Fig. 4D, E, F). Indicative of increased
stem cell like potential of CD44+/CD24+ double positive
side population, these cells showed a clear enrichment
in Oct4 expression as compared to CD44+ positive bulk
of the cells (Fig. 4G, H, I). Importantly, although CIP2A
expression pattern between two cell populations was

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

more variable, Oct4 and CIP2A were co-expressed in the
CD44+/CD24+ positive side population in all studied cell
lines (Fig. 4G, H, I).
From these data we conclude that CIP2A and Oct4
are co-expressed in side-population of HNSCC cells
and thus their regulatory relationship may contribute to
HNSCC progression and therapy response.

Oct4 positivity is linked to poor HNSCCC
tumor differentiation level and increased
radioresistance whereas CIP2A confers poor
HNSCC patient survival
To clarify the possible clinical importance of
CIP2A and Oct4 in HNSCC, we studied CIP2A and Oct4
expression in 52 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) patient samples by immunohistochemistry
(Fig. 5A). As shown in Table 2, 82.7% of HNSCC cancer
samples were CIP2A positive, whereas 36.5% were Oct4
positive. Interestingly, Oct4 positive HNSCC tumors
were always also CIP2A positive (Table 2). The relative
expression levels of CIP2A and Oct4 were monitored, and
their association to 5-year overall survival were studied
in these 52 HNSCC patients. Staining intensity of CIP2A
was categorized to three different groups (negative, low or
high) whereas Oct4 exhibited either negative or positive
staining in HNSCC tumours (Fig. 5A). Importantly,
high CIP2A positivity indicated a reduced overall 5-year
survival, compared to patients with low or negative
CIP2A positivity (P = 0.020, log-rank test; Fig. 5B).

promoting function for CIP2A in HNSCCs [24], this data
indicate that CIP2A is a driver oncoprotein in HNSCC.
However, when overall survival of Oct4 positive cancers
was compared to Oct4 negative cancers, a trend towards
poor patient survival was observed in Oct4 positive
cases, however this effect was not statistically significant
(Supplementary Figure 4). Next, we set to study the other
clinical variables that might be linked to cancers that
are positive for both Oct4 and CIP2A, and assessed the
differentiation status of the tumors, as low differentiation
grade is known to be associated with existence of more
stem-like cells [43]. Indeed, when histological grading
of HNSCC samples was taken into account, we observed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that 16/19 (84.2%) of Oct4/CIP2A double positive tumors
were poorly differentiated whereas only 3/19 (15.8%)
of CIP2A/Oct4 double positive were well-differentiated
tumors ( p = 0.0029; Fig. 5C). These results are in line
with Oct4 function as a key regulator of stemness and cell
differentiation.
In vivo testicular irradiation experiment indicated
that CIP2A and Oct4 were expressed in radioresistant
population of spermatogonia (Fig. 1). Radiotherapy is
widely used in HNSCC treatments, but the markers that
would predict for radioresistancy in HNSCC are mostly
lacking. Among the studied patient material, 29 of our 52
HNSCC patients (56%) were treated with radiotherapy.

Among those, 55% of patients’ tumors were negative for
Oct4 expression, whereas 45% of patients’ tumors were
Oct4 positive and expressed also CIP2A. Importantly,
in the radiotherapy group, Oct4 positivity predicted for
a reduced overall 5-year survival, compared to patients
with Oct4 negative staining (P = 0.027, log-rank test;
Fig. 5D). To validate the clinical results, we compared
Oct4 and CIP2A expression levels in UT-SCC cell lines
evaluated in this study (Fig. 4B and 6A, B), to the intrinsic
radioresistancy of these cell lines based on previous
publications [47, 48]. When relative Oct4/CIP2A mRNA
expression values of six different HNSCC cell lines with
the highest and lowest double Oct4/CIP2A expression
index were compared to the area under the survival curve
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

values (AUC), a tendency between Oct4/CIP2A double
positivity and the intrinsic radioresistancy was observed
(Table 3, Fig. 5E).
Together these results demonstrate that CIP2A
expression predicts for poor patient survival in HNSCC.
Moreover, the results indicate that high Oct4 and CIP2A
expression in HNSCC cells confer HNSCC tumour
radioresistancy.

is very significantly inhibited by CIP2A depletion [24].
Moreover results above indicate that CIP2A expression
correlates with tumor aggressiveness in vivo. To further
test how CIP2A and Oct4 expression in HNSCC cells
correlate with their tumorigenic capacity, we selected for
subcutaneous xenograft experiment UT-SCC cell lines
that contained either lower (UT-SCC-50) or higher (UTSCC-14) CIP2A mRNA expression levels than in cell lines
UT-SCC-9 and UT-SCC-7 whose CIP2A-dependence
has been validated. Regarding Oct-4, UT-SCC14 had
clearly higher expression than CIP2A-dependent cell
lines, whereas expression in UT-SCC-50 was in a range
of tumorigenic UT-SCC-7 cells (Fig. 6A and 6B). Notably,
within five weeks, all mice (3/3) injected with UT-SCC-14
cells (CIP2A/Oct4 double positive) formed large palpable
tumours (range 1.8-2.5 cm; Fig. 6C), whereas only 1/3
mice injected with low CIP2A expressing HNSCC cell line
(UT-SCC-50) formed a barely detectable tumour (Fig. 6C).
These data further support our conclusions that
CIP2A expression confers HNSCC tumorigenicity. We
further postulate that in the context of Oct4 positive cells
with increased stemness, Oct4-driven CIP2A expression
contributes to clinical radioresistance in virtue by its
effects on various oncogenic pathways rendering to
increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance (Fig. 6D).

Capacity of either normal or malignant tissue to
recover from DNA damaging insult is dependent on degree
of DNA damage induced, cellular capacity to repair the
damaged DNA, as well as capacity of cells to proliferate
during the regeneration phase. In the context of malignant
tumors, this equals to regrowth of the tumor following
therapy. Traditionally, the role of Oct4 and other bona
fide stem cell factors in radioresistance has been linked
to their function in maintaining DNA damage resistant
pool of stem cells, that then give rise to regenerating
pool of progenitor cells. However, Oct4 target genes that
contribute to cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance
are poorly understood. In that regard, identification of
CIP2A as a novel Oct4 target gene may have important
implication in our understanding the mechanisms by
which high Oct4 expression drives cellular radioresistance
beyond its role in regulating cell stemness (Fig. 6D). In
addition to MYC, CIP2A mediated regulation of PP2A
serine/threonine phosphatase activity promotes activity
of several oncogenic mechanisms such as Akt kinase
activity and E2F1 phosphorylation [27, 28]. Therefore it
will be of great interest to further study whether activities
of these CIP2A effector pathways are regulated by Oct4,
and what is their functional relevance for Oct4 driven
radioresistance. In summary our data extends the function
of Oct4 from being only a regulator of cell stemness, to
regulator of phosphoprotein signaling via CIP2A, and we
postulate that combination of these activities contribute to
clinical radioresistance (Fig. 6D).
CIP2A promotes malignant cell transformation
and tumour growth [24, 25], and importantly its
downregulation does not cause detrimental systemic side
effects in vivo [29]. As CIP2A is overexpressed practically
in all human cancer types, and its expression predicts
poor patient survival in a dozen different cancers [25],
it is an obvious drug target candidate protein. It is also
evident that future identification of target mechanisms
regulated by Oct4 driven CIP2A expression may help in
development of novel radiosensitation therapies. In that
regard, results of this study may have clinical potential
in treatment of many different malignancies, in addition
to HNSCC.

DISCUSSION
Resistance towards DNA damaging anticancer
therapies has been demonstrated to be associated with
stem cell nature of cancer cells [49]. Oct4 is a stem cell
transcription factor that is overexpressed in various human
cancer types, and this expression has been linked to both
poor patient survival and resistance to DNA-damaging
therapies [22, 44]. In this work we identify CIP2A as a novel
Oct4 target gene associated with cellular radioresistance and
tumorigenicity. The radioresistance phenotype of Oct4/
CIP2A double positive cells is indicated by various lines of
evidence extending from radioresistant normal testicular cell
population in vivo (Fig. 1C), to both HNSCC tumor tissues
(Fig. 5D) and cell lines (Fig. 5E).

HNSCC radioresistance and
tumorigenesis

Figure 6: CIP2A and Oct4 double positivity is linked to cancer aggressiveness and increased radioresistance in HNSCC
cell lines. (A-B) Relative mRNA expression levels of CIP2A and Oct4 in six different HNSCC cell lines (UT-SCC) were studied with

qPCR. Xenograft capacity demonstrates how easily HNSCC cell line is capable to grow in nude mice. ND = not determined. (C) Xenoraft
experiment where HNSCC cell lines containing low (UT-SCC-50) and high (UT-SCC-14) Oct4/CIP2A mRNA expression levels were
injected into nude mouse subcutaneous and followed for five weeks. (D) CIP2A expression is important for HNSCC tumorigenicity
and radioresistancy. In the context of Oct4 positive cells with increased stemness, Oct4-driven CIP2A expression contributes to clinical
radioresistance and tumorigenesis by affecting oncogenic pathways involved in proliferation and apoptosis resistance.

Head and neck cancers are the sixth commonest
cancer types worldwide with poor prognosis [1]. In order
to study the importance of Oct4 and CIP2A co-expression
in other than testicular cancers, we used HNSCC cell
lines and patient specimens. Our results demonstrate
that CIP2A and Oct4 expression is linked in HNSCC
cell lines, and that the cell lines with CIP2A and Oct4
co-expression were radioresistant. In patient samples of
HNSCC, CIP2A was expressed in 82.7% and Oct4 in
36.5% of the studied tumor samples, respectively, and all
Oct4 positive HNSCC tumours were also CIP2A positive.
Our demonstration that CIP2A and Oct4 expression is
linked to poor differentiation level of HNSCC tumors,
and predicts for a poor patient survival among HNSCC
patients treated with radiotherapy is intriguing. It is clear

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

further prospective study using larger HNSCC patient
groups is warranted to validate the potential clinical
usefulness of these results. In general terms, our results
indicate that cancer cells can adapt similar mechanisms for
X-irradiation resistance as normal stem cells, and that this
might be one explanation for poor radiotherapy response
in those cancer cases. Consequently, targeting of the
mechanisms implicated in radioresistance could provide
a foundation for new radiosensitation therapies. CIP2A
inhibition has previously been shown to potently inhibit
HNSCC tumorigenesis [24], whereas here we demonstrate
that high CIP2A expression was linked to poor overall
5-year survival in HNSCC. Together these results support
the idea that targeting of CIP2A could simultaneously be
used for radiosensitation of Oct4 positive cancer stem

sample was run on agarose gel to confirm good quality
of the isolated RNA (intact 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA
bands). One microgram of RNA was processed further.
Firstly, traces of contaminating genomic DNA were
removed by treating the samples with DNase I (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). DyNAmo SYBR Green 2-step
qRT-PCR Kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) was used
for cDNA synthesis and 0.5 μg of template RNA was
reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl-reaction with oligo(dT)
primers while another 0.5 μg was used as a template in
RT- reaction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In vivo X-irradiation and tumor formation
experiments
Mice were housed in plastic cages (Tecniplast,
Buguggiate, Italy) in a climate-controlled room at the
Animal Centre of Turku University (Turku, Finland).
Aspen chips (Tapvei Co., Kaavi, Finland) were used
as bedding material. Animals were maintained on a
12 h light/12 h dark cycle (lighted from 07 to 19 h) and
they had free access to tap water and standard laboratory
animal feed (Commercial RM3 (E) SQC, Special Diet
Service, Witham, UK). Two-month-old mice (C57BL/6)
were anaesthetised with 2.5% Avertin (Aldrich Chemical
Co., Milwaukee, WI, USA) i.p. and locally irradiated (with
a water-equivalent build-up layer, focus-target distance
100 cm, field size 4 x 10 cm, dose rate 3 Gy/min) by
3-4 Gy using 6 MV X-rays produced by a Clinac 600C
linear accelerator (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The mice
were sacrificed by neck dislocation under CO2 anaesthesia
6, 17, 24, 48, 72, 96 or 144 hours after X-irradiation and
their testes were dissected and decapsulated. Seminiferous
tubules were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used in
RNA analyses. Radiation dose in testis was determined
mathematically using a computer tomography based
Eclipse planning system (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
Control mice were subjected to the same treatment
omitting the X-irradiation. In xenograft experiment
previously established UT-SCC-14 (originating from a
persistent T3N1M0 Gr 2 cancer of the mobile tongue)
and UT-SCC-50 (established from a recurrent T2N0M0
Gr 3 glottic laryngeal tumor) HNSCC cell lines [50]
were seleceted for in vivo tumour formation experiment.
2 × 106 cells were injected into immunocompromised
mouse subcutaneously. Altogether 6 mice were injected
and the size of the palpable tumors was evaluated every
third day for five weeks. All animal experiments were
conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Provincial Government of Southern Finland and handled in
accordance with the institutional animal care policies of the
University of Turku. The Experimental Animal Committee
of the University of Turku has approved all protocols used
in animal experiments (ESLH-2007- 08517).

Real-time PCR
Primers (Supplementary table 1) were designed to
be located to different exonic sequences with the help
of online Primer 3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/)
and mRNA sequence data available at Ensembl
(www.ensembl.org/) and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm
.nih.gov/) databases to avoid amplification of genomic
DNA. To avoid misleading detection of Oct4, the primers
were designed so that they do not recognize any of the
Oct4 pseudogenes [41]. Amplification of target cDNAs
was performed using CFX96 real-time PCR detection
system device (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA,
USA) and the DyNAmo Flash SYBR green qPCR kit
(F-415L; Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR
was executed under the following conditions: 95°C for
7 min followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 s and 55–64°C
(depending on the primer pair; see Supplementary table 1)
for 15s. Relative gene expression data was normalized
to expression level of endogenous house-keeping genes
(Ppia (cyclophilin A) and RPL19 (ribosomal protein
L19) using 2^-ΔΔC(t) method [51]. Specificity of PCR
reactions was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and
melting curve analysis. One band of the expected size and
a single peak, respectively, were required.

Antibodies, immunohistochemistry
and tissue samples
Following antibodies were used for Western blotting:
CIP2A (CIP2A (2610-3B5) sc-80659, mouse monoclonal,
1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Oct4 (Oct-3/4
(c-10), sc-5279, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, Santa Cruz

monoclonal mouse (33A12E10), 1:1000) and actin (antiβ-actin Clone AC-74, monoclonal mouse, Sigma-Aldrich
1:5000). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of
mouse and human organs were cut into 6 μm thin sections,
deparaffinised and thereafter rehydrated. Epitope retrieval
was then proceeded in 10 mM Tris-EDTA-buffer (pH 9)
during 4 min in microwave oven 4 min 850 W followed
by 15 min at a lower power (150 W). After blocking
with 3% BSA PBS for 10 min the slides were rinsed in

RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was isolated from cell pellets or
seminiferous tubules of mouse testis using Trisure reagent
(Bioline, London, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After isolation, RNA concentration was
measured using a NanoDrop device (ND-1000; NanoDrop
Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and the RNA

After 3 days the promoter activity was measured using
Promega’s Dual-Glo luciferase Assay system (E2940)
according to manufactures protocol. Luminescence
was measured with Victor-multilabel counter 1420
(PerkinElmer).

Murine embryonic stem cell (mESC)
in vitro studies
ZHBTc4 ES cells [38] were kindly provided
by Dr. Hitoshi Niwa (Center For Developmental
Biology, Laboratory for Pluripotent Cell Studies, Kobe,
Japan). Murine ESCs were kept in undifferentiated
state by culturing them on a feeder layer of mitomycin
C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts with basic
ES cell medium. The cells were passaged every twothree days and ES cell medium was exchanged daily. To
study the effect of Oct4-mediated differentiation of mES
cells ZHBTc4 ES cells were plated on to 0.1% gelatincoated culture dishes and treated without or with 1 μg/ml
doxycycline. Samples were collected 6, 12, 24, 48 and
72 hours by scraping off the cells, pelleting them by
centrifugation and snap-freezing them in liquid nitrogen.
Three independent experiments were performed, all of
which gave similar results.

Cell sorting
UT-SCC2, -7 and -9 cells were harvested with
0.01% Trypsin-EDTA and washed twice with cold
buffer (D-PBS, 2% FCS, 0.01% sodium azide). Primary
antibodies (anti-human CD44 (clone 9B5) rat monoclonal
antibody was a kind gift from Professor Marko Salmi
(Turku, Finland), anti-human CD24 (clone ML5) Alexa
Fluor® 647 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences))
were added at dilution of 1:100 and incubated for 1 hour at
+4°C, after which cells were washed. Secondary antibody
(Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat Anti-Rat IgG (Life Technologies))
was added at dilution of 1:400 and incubated for 1 hour
at +4°C. The cells were washed and sorted with BD
FACSAria™ III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). After sorting
the cells were lysed with TXLB buffer. Sorting experiment
was repeated three times for each cell line.

Derivation of embryonic stem cells
from blastocysts
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were isolated from
CIP2A and WT mouse blastocysts as described by Bryja
and coworkers [53]. Briefly, time-mated females were
killed at E3.5, and the blastocysts were flushed out of the
uterine horn. Blastocysts were plated to dishes containing
mitotically inactivated feeder cells (mouse embryonic
fibroblasts, MEFs). Blastocysts were allowed to attach
to MEFs and grow in ES medium containing knockout
serum replacement (SR-ES medium). The content of the
medium was: Knockout DMEM supplemented with 20%
Knockout SR (Gibco), penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin
(100 g/ml) (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco),
1 X minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids
(Gibco), 100 μM -mercaptoethanol and recombinant
mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (1,000 U/ml of ESGRO,
Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). The blastocysts
and ESCs derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts
were allowed to grow alternately in SR-ES medium and
FCS-ES medium. In FCS-ES medium SR was replaced
by 20% fetal calf serum (FCS). In the method, the cells
were grown always after trypsinization in FCS-ES for
one day to allow greater trophic support, whereas SR-ES
medium supported selective propagation of ESCs between
trypsinizations.

siRNA transfections
Tcam2 and Tera1 cell lines were cultured in RPMI
with Glutamax (Invitrogen, 61870-010), 10% FCS and
antibiotics (streptomycin and penicillin) and were adapted
to 50–250 nM concentration of CIP2A or scramble
(SCR) siRNA or medium (negative control). siRNA was
transfected with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA were
used in 50–250 nM concentration for 3 d or 5 d. Used
siRNA sequences are presented in Supplementary table 2.

Promoter assay
Tcam2-cells were double transfected using the
Surefect transfection reagent according to manufactures
protocol (Nunclon Surface, Nunc). Cells were transfected
with CIP2A-promoter construct (1802 bp upstream [38],
renilla plasmid and siRNA (either scrambled or siOct4-1).
Promoter construct (200 ng), renilla (10 ng) and 2 pmol of
siRNA were transfected per 96 well plate. Transfections
with -1802 bp, -865 bp and -1802ΔCIP2ALuc CIP2A
promoter constructs were also done as described above
only without siRNAs. -1802ΔCIP2ALuc construct

The results were analysed for statistically significant
differences using one-way analysis of variance, followed
by Dunnett’s tests (vs. 0h) for multiple comparisons
of independent groups of samples (Fig. 1C). Student’s
t-test was used to compare mRNA levels of CIP2A,
Nanog and Oct4 in blastocyst-derived ES cells between
WT and CIP2A HOZ mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). The
assumptions of normal distribution and equal variance
within the data sets were fulfilled. Correlation of gene
expression levels in UT-SCC cell lines was analysed by
using linear regression analysis (Fig. 4B–C). In HNSCC
patient data statistical analyses were presented using
frequencies and percents. The differences between CIP2A
and Oct4 expression to 5-year overall survival were studied
using survival analysis. Survival curves were estimated
using Kaplan-Meier technique, and differences were tested
using a log-rank test. p-values (two-tailed) less than 0.05
were considered statistically significant (Fig. 5B and 5D).
For each UT-SCC cell line 95% confidence intervals were
calculated for AUC means (Table 3, Fig. 5E). Statistical
analyses were performed using the SAS System for
