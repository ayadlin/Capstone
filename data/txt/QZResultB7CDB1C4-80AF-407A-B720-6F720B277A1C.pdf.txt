ABSTRACT
We employed a high-throughput drug library screening platform to identify
novel agents affecting thyroid cancer cells. We used human thyroid cancer cell
lines to screen a collection of approximately 5200 small molecules with biological
and/or pharmacologial properties. Parallel primary screens yielded a number of
hits differentially active between thyroid and melanoma cells. Amongst compounds
specifically targeting thyroid cancer cells, colchicine emerged as an effective
candidate. Colchicine inhibited cell growth which correlated with G2 cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis. These effects were hampered through inhibition of MEK1/2 and JNK.
In contrast, inhibition of p38-MAPK had little effect, and AKT had no impact on
colchicine action. Systemic colchicine inhibited thyroid cancer progression in
xenografted mice. These findings demonstrate that our screening platform is an
effective vehicle for drug reposition and show that colchicine warrants further
attention in well-defined clinical niches such as thyroid cancer.

INTRODUCTION

potential for increased toxicity and economic implications
can limit clinical feasibility. Additionally, recent evidence
identified a role for the AKT pathway in mediating
resistance to BRAF inhibition [6].
Prompted by these limitations, we set out to identify
existing compounds active in thyroid cancer cells and
explore their mechanism of cytotoxicity. Recognized
for their BRAFV600E mutation and sensitivity to BRAF
inhibition [7], melanoma cells were included in our
drug screens as a reference. Fully-automated screens
by integrated robotics were run in parallel to employ a
collection of nearly 5200 small molecules that were
assembled to include most FDA-approved drugs and
a large array of compounds with known biological
and biochemical properties. This screening platform,

Inhibition of the BRAFV600E oncoprotein by smallmolecule drugs such as PLX4032 (vemurafenib) is highly
effective in the treatment of melanoma [1]. However,
thyroid cancer patients who are radioiodine refractory
and harbor the same BRAFV600E oncogenic mutation,
show variable responses to this class of inhibitors [2, 3],
suggesting a lack of drug selectivity. Alternatively,
underlying drug resistance might conceivably result from
additional MAPK pathway alterations [4]. Accordingly,
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) inhibitors
appear to provide synergy with BRAF inhibitors in
multiple BRAF-mutant cancers [5]. Although such drug
combinations may show a more effective action, the

and late marker of apoptosis detected by PI, were
observed by flow cytometry in live cells treated with
variable concentrations of colchicine (0.01–1.0 µM)
across different time points (24–72 hrs) (Figure 3A).
Further, we observed that the effect of colchicine
correlated with PARP cleavage in a time- (Figure 3B) and
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C), as detected by
Western blotting. Importantly, the pro-apoptotic action of
colchicine was accompanied by the activation of multiple
signaling pathways. In 8505C cells, we noted increased
phosphorylation of the MAP kinases MEK/ERK, p38, and
JNK. Further, despite an early inhibitory impact detected
after 24 hrs treatment, AKT phosphorylation was increased
by 72 hrs in both cell types (Figure 3B). In WRO cells, we
also noted increased MEK, p38, and JNK phosphorylation
in response to colchicine treatment, while elevated pERK
levels remained unaffected (Figure 3B, 3C).
To study the significance of these pathway alterations
in relation to colchicine mode-of-action, we co-incubated
colchicine with a variety of chemicals known to impact
specific cell signaling routes. Inhibition of MEK1/2
with U0126 virtually abolished the apoptotic effect of
colchicine, as shown by absence of PARP degradation
(Figure 4A), reduced apoptotic cell fraction (Figure
4E), and rescue of cell viability (Figure 4F). Similarly,
we noted the ability of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 to
diminish colchicine-induced apoptosis (Figure 4C, 4E)
and rescue cell viability (Figure 4F). In contrast, the
effect of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 was less evident
on PARP degradation in WRO cells (Figure 4B), and it
only partially rescued these cells from apoptosis (Figure
4E) with minimal impact on cell viability (Figure 4F)
in response to colchicine treatment. Additionally,
SB203580 failed to rescue colchicine-induced PARP
degradation (Figure 4B), apoptosis (Figure 4E), or
viability (Figure 4F) of 8505C cells. Moreover, the
AKT inhibitor LY294002 had no measureable impact on
colchicine action in either cell type including apoptosis
(Figure 4D, 4E) and cell viability (Figure 4F), thus ruling
out AKT involvement in colchicine action in these cells.
To further distinguish between the roles of different
MAP kinases on colchicine action, we generated
colchicine-resistant 8505C cells. Confirmation of drug
resistance was demonstrated by expression of the MDR-1
marker (Figure 5A), the absence of PARP degradation
(Figure 5A), and the lack of any impact on cell viability
following colchicine treatment (Figure 5B). Compared
with their sensitive parental cells, colchicine-resistant
8505C cells continued to exhibit measureable p38
phosphorylation responses, but failed to stimulate MEK,
ERK1/2, or JNK (Figure 5A).

RESULTS
High-throughput screening and hit selection
To identify small molecules that can inhibit the
viability of thyroid cancer cells, we developed a screening
platform using 8505C and KTC-1 cells that harbor the
BRAFV600E mutation and, as a reference for a non-thyroidal
BRAF mutant phenotype, human melanoma Malme-3M
cells. The screening libraries included approximately
5200 small molecules selected to facilitate drug reposition
and mechanistic studies. Primary screening data were
normalized by Z-score transformation as shown in
Figure 1A. The screening procedure identified a BRAF
inhibitor active in melanoma Malme-3M cells (Figure 1B)
(IC50 = 0.85 ± 0.19 µM) but virtually ineffective in
thyroid 8505C and KTC-1 cancer cells (IC50 > 10 μM, not
shown). In contrast, the EGF-R inhibitor AV-412 showed
inhibitory effects on thyroid 8505C and KTC-1 cells with
reduced effects on melanoma Malme-3M cells (Figure 1C).
These findings provided evidence of the platform’s ability
to correctly identify drugs of recognized activity in a
cell-contextual manner.

Colchicine inhibits thyroid cancer cells
From the initial screens, we selected colchicine,
which was present in 3 different locations within the
screening library, as one of the top hits (Figure 1A).
Validation testing demonstrated the ability of colchicine
to decrease 8505C and KTC-1 thyroid cancer cell viability
with IC50 of 0.02 ± 0.00 µM and 0.44 ± 0.17 µM,
respectively, whereas a much lower activity was displayed
in melanoma cells (Figure 2A). Importantly, these findings
were also extended to other thyroid cancer cell lines
including WRO and TPC-1 cells (Figure 2B).

Colchicine induces growth arrest of thyroid
cancer cells at G2/M phase
To examine the mechanisms underlying growth
inhibition of colchicine, we monitored cell cycle phase
progression by flow cytometry. Figure 2C demonstrates
the impact of colchicine on increasing the proportion
of 8505C and WRO cells in G2/M phase, and shows a
markedly diminished entry of cells into the G1 phase.

cell mouse xenografts. These studies revealed the ability
of colchicine to significantly reduce 8505C tumor volume
and tumor weight (Figure 6A, 6B). Comparable results
were also recapitulated in the WRO cell xenografts
(Figure 6F, 6G). Further, TUNEL staining identified a
significant impact on apoptosis in both animal models
(Figure 6C, 6H). PHH3 staining also demonstrated
the ability of colchicine to reduce the proportion of
proliferating malignant cells in both cell line xenografts
(Figure 6D, 6I). Finally, we observed that colchicine
administration was well-tolerated in mice with no adverse
impact on body weight (Figure 6E, 6J), and overall health
(not shown).

targeting of this kinase in thyroid cancer remains limited
but encouraging [7, 14]. From a clinical perspective, the
appreciation of discrepant responses amongst BRAF
mutant cancers [15, 16] has highlighted the need for
additional therapeutic strategies.
In this report, colchicine was selected using a
high-throughput screening campaign, and our findings,
altogether, point to its therapeutic impact in thyroid
cancer. Notably, high-throughput (HT) drug screens were
rarely employed for thyroid cancer. In this regard, a HEK
293-based HT assay was previously shown to identify
cyclic AMP agonists of the TSH receptor [17] and, more
recently, a different platform yielded EGFR/HER2 and
HDAC inhibitors as possible therapeutics [18].
Colchicine represents a vinca alkaloid clearly
recognized for its ability to bind tubulin [19].
Microtubules have long been considered as an ideal target
for anti-cancer drugs because of their essential functions
in mitosis and, in particular, the formation of the dynamic
spindle apparatus. In this regard, colchicine inhibits
tubulin polymerization by blocking the cell cycle at the

DISCUSSION
The relevance to thyroid cancer of the MAPK
pathway and of the BRAFV600E mutation is now
well-established [8–10]. Its diagnostic relevance has
been accepted [11], however, its prognostic significance
remains controversial [12, 13]. Selective pharmacologic

8505C cells and two resistant clones 8505C–R2 and 8505C–R4 were subjected to serum starvation for 24 hrs. Cells were then treated with

activation, and PARP cleavage. (B) Cell viability by Alamar Blue staining of parental 8505C cells and two resistant clones 8505C–R2 and

G2/M phase and triggering apoptosis [20]. While such
an impact may lead to toxic effects, orally-administered
colchicine is a well-established, safe treatment [21].
Thus, it may be reasonable to consider repositioning of
colchicine as a lead compound, alone or in combination
with other drugs.
Here, we show that colchicine exhibits cytotoxicity
against thyroid cancer cell lines in the nanomolar
concentrations. Our findings implicate multiple MAP
kinases in colchicine-induced apoptosis. Consistent
with our current findings, earlier studies suggested
the involvement of JNK as a putative MAPK target in
thyroid cancer cell growth [22]. In contrast, the ability of
colchicine-resistant cells to support p38 phosphorylation
raises questions about requirements of this MAPK in
colchicine-induced thyroid cancer cell apoptosis. Our

results are partially supported by earlier findings where
colchicine-induced neuronal toxicity was linked to JNK
and p38-MAPK, but not with ERK1/2-MAPK activation
[23]. We propose that recruitment of multiple MAPKs
affords colchicine, as shown here, broader activity across
BRAF-mutant and BRAF-WT thyroid cancer cells.
Recently, allocolchicines and other analogues have
shown potentially promising effects in cancer cells. Of
note, the (S)-3, 8, 9, 10-tetramethoxyallocolchicine
derivative, while showing effective chemotherapeutic
properties against pancreatic cancer cells, did not
perturb tubulin polymerization, suggesting involvement
of alternative targets [24]. It is therefore possible that
colchicine analogues display reduced toxicity profiles,
thus boosting their suitability for the treatment of thyroid
cancer.

with known impact on key molecular players, signaling
pathways, and more general biological processes.
Chemicals were obtained from Prestwick Chemical
(Prestwick Chemical Library), Tocris Bioscience,
MicroSource Discovery Systems (Spectrum Collection),
BioFocus (NIH Clinical Collection), and the Ontario
Institute for Cancer Research (protein kinase inhibitors).
Cells were seeded in 384-well plates in a total volume of
40 µL/well. On the following day, screening compounds
(1mmol/L in DMSO) were robotically pinned (200 nL)
into assay wells to achieve a final concentration of
5 µmol/L. Equal amounts of DMSO (0.5%) were used as
vehicle controls. After 48 hrs incubation, Alamar Blue was
added at 10% of the volume (4 μL/well), and cell viability
was read 4 hrs later using a PHERAstar plate reader
(BMG Labtech).

Chemicals and reagents
The EGF-R inhibitor AV-412 (MP-412) was
obtained from AdooQ Bioscience, colchicine was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. The BRAF inhibitor PLX4032, the
MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, the p38 inhibitor SB203580,
the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 were obtained from Selleck Chemicals
(Houston, TX). All drugs were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −20°C.

Cell lines and culture
The human thyroid carcinoma–derived cell lines
8505C, KTC-1 (Cell Resource Center for Biomedical
Research, Sendai, Japan) and WRO (G. Juilliard, UCLA,
Los Angeles) were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 1 × non-essential amino
acids, streptomycin sulfate (100 U/ml), and penicillin
(100 µg/ml). TPC-1 (S. Jiang, Ohio State University)
thyroid cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS,
and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. The human melanoma
carcinoma–derived cell line Malme-3M was cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate.
All cell lines were grown and maintained at 37°C, 95%
humidity, and 5% CO2. Cell lines were assembled in
2006 and authenticated by short tandem repeats. Cell
counts were performed with a Beckman Coulter counter
(Fullerton) while cell viability was determined by Alamar
Blue (Invitrogen) staining. Development of colchicineresistant sub-lines was performed by continuous exposure
to colchicine using an initial concentration of 0.01 μmol/L
that was increased in a step-wise fashion to 1.0 μmol/L.
Resistant cell lines were maintained in media containing
1.0 μmol/L colchicine for more than 6 months.

Flow cytometry
Approximately 2 × 106 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml
of phosphate-buffered saline and vortexed with 3 ml of
80% ethanol. Cells were fixed at 4°C for 1 hr, washed with
phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in 3 ml of staining
Buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA in D-PBS),
vortexed vigorously, and left at room temperature for
5 min. Cells were re-suspended in 1 ml of staining buffer
containing 50 µg/ml of DNase-free RNase A and 50 µg/ml
of propidium iodide (PI). Cells were stained for at least
1 hr at room temperature in the dark. Stained cells were
analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on
a FACS CALIBUR4 flow cytometer.

Cell apoptosis analysis
Annexin V-FITC staining of phosphatidylserine
residues is indicative of early apoptotic events, whereas
propidium iodide staining is a typical marker of late
apoptosis processes. We used the Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit with PI from Biolegend (San
Diego, CA). Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold
PBS and re-suspended in binding buffer and incubated
with 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of PI for 15 min
at room temperature in the dark. Stained cells were then
analyzed by FACS CALIBUR4 flow cytometer within 1 hr.
Data were analyzed using the Flowing software 2.

High-throughput screening (HTS)
High-throughput screens were performed in the
SMART Laboratory for High-Throughput Screening
Programs of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research
Institute (Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto). Assays were
fully automated on a Dimension 4, modular platform
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Biomek FX
liquid handler. Screening compounds (n~5200) were
acquired from several vendors re-assembled to form
a unique collection suitable for drug reposition and
mechanistic studies aimed at target identification and
validation. Compounds included FDA-approved drugs,
drug candidates with history in human clinical trials, and
chemical entities (including 320 protein kinase inhibitors)

on 10% or 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred
electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes.
Membranes were blocked in TBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 (TBS-T) plus 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 hr at room
temperature, probed with various primary antibodies
(Table 1) at 4°C overnight. Membranes were washed
3 times and incubated with the appropriate secondary
antibodies (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG) conjugated
with horse-radish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:2000 in

(0.5 mg/kg/day) daily for 2 weeks. Tumor volume ([length
× width2]/2) and bodyweight were measured every other
day. Mice were sacrificed and tumors dissected and
weighed. Mouse organs were fixed in 10% formaldehyde
for paraffin embedding.

Morphologic studies of mouse xenografts
To detect apoptosis, we used the terminal
deoxyncleotidyl transferase TDT-mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique
(ApopTag kit, Oncor, NY). Paraffin sections were
dewaxed through changes of xylene, hydrated through
graded alcohols and pretreated with 1% pepsin (Sigma)
in 0.01N HCl at pH 2.0 at 37°C for 15 min. Endogenous
peroxidase was blocked using 3% aqueous hydrogen
peroxide and endogenous biotin activity was blocked
with an avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector labs). Sections
were incubated with the Biotin-nucleotide cocktail [DNA
Polymerase 1 Large (Klenow) Fragment (Promega);
dATP, dCTP, dGTP (Promega); Bio-11-dUTP Cedarlane
40029BT)] in at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was
visualized with the Ultra Streptavidin Horseradish
Peroxidase Labeling Reagent (ID Labs Inc.) for
30 mins at room temperature and developed with freshly
prepared DAB (Dako) and counterstained with Mayer’s
hematoxylin. To detect cell proliferation we used
phosphorylated histone H3 (PHH3) staining (Upstate,
NY). Sections were pretreated with citrate at pH 6.0
and the antibody was incubated at 1/2000 for one hour,

In vivo mouse studies
Animal studies were carried out in accordance with
the Canadian Council for Animal Care guidelines and
approved by the Ontario Cancer Institute (OCI) Animal
Care and Use Committee. Six week-old female severecombined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were purchased
from OCI (Toronto, Canada). Five × 106 cells were
implanted subcutaneously into the right flanks of mice.
Treatment was initiated after tumor diameter had reached
5 mm followed by random allocation of animals to
equalize variations in tumor volume across groups. Mice
were divided into 3 groups: the control group was treated
with DMSO (5%), the second group was subcutaneously
treated with colchicine (0.2 mg/kg/day), and the third
group was subcutaneously treated with colchicine

on emerging treatments for radioactive iodine-refractory
patients. Oncologist. 2015; 20:113–126.

Data are presented as means ± SD. Statistical
analyses were performed using the software package
(SPSS 19.0). We used independent t-tests for comparison
between different cell types and for different animal
groups. We used paired t-tests for comparison of
treatments at the same time point of the same cell type.
P-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically
significant.
