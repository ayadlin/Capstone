BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify predictors of locoregional recurrence (LRR) after neoadjuvant therapy
(NAT) and postmastectomy radiation (PMRT) in a cohort of patients with stage II through III breast cancer and to determine whether
omission of the supraclavicular field had an impact on the risk of LRR. METHODS: The authors reviewed records from 464 patients
who received NAT and PMRT from January 1999 to December 2009. RESULTS: The median patient age was 50 years (range, 25-81
years). Clinical disease stage was stage II in 29% of patients, stage III in 71%, and inflammatory in 14%. Receptor status was estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive in 54% of patients, progesterone receptor (PR)-positive in 39%, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)-positive in 24%, and negative for all 3 receptors (triple negative) in 32%. All patients received NAT and underwent mastectomy, and 19.6% had a complete pathologic response in the breast and axilla, 17.5% received radiation to the chest wall only, and
82.5% received radiation to the chest wall and the supraclavicular field; omission of the supraclavicular field was more common in
patients with lower clinical and pathologic lymph node status. The median follow-up was 50.5 months, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of LRR was 6% (95% confidence interval, 3.9%-8.6%). Predictors of LRR were clinical stage III (P ¼ .038), higher clinical lymph
node status (P ¼ .025), higher pathologic lymph node status (P ¼ .003), the combination of clinically and pathologically positive
lymph nodes (P < .001), inflammatory presentation (P ¼ .037), negative ER status (P ¼ .006), negative PR status (P ¼ .015), triplenegative status (P < .001), and pathologic tumor size >2 cm (P ¼ .045). On univariate analysis, omission of the supraclavicular field
was not associated significantly with LRR (hazard ratio, 0.89; P ¼ .833); however, on multivariate analyses, omission of the supraclavicular field was associated significantly with LRR (hazard ratio, 3.39; P ¼ .024). CONCLUSIONS: Presenting stage, receptor status,
pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy, and omission the supraclavicular field were identified as risk factors for LRR after neoC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Three major randomized trials1-3 and the landmark Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group meta-analysis4
have demonstrated that postmastectomy radiation (PMRT) reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and the
improves survival of patients with breast cancer. On the basis of these and other studies, the role of PMRT traditionally
has been determined by pathologic staging, with surgery as the first treatment modality.
However, the use of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has become increasingly common, particularly in locally advanced
disease. Although it has not been demonstrated that the sequence of chemotherapy has an impact on survival, younger premenopausal patients may derive a greater benefit from NAT,5 and response to NAT is predictive of both local control and
survival.6,7 NAT has an impact on the extent of disease at the time of surgery and results in a pathologic complete response
(pCR) in the breast and axilla in 5% to 40% of patients. The response to NAT is affected by many variables, including receptor status, chemotherapy type, and initial stage at presentation.5,7-9 Although NAT has many advantages, its impact on
surgical staging reduces the applicability of the traditional pathologic guidelines for PMRT, and clear guidelines for the
use of PMRT after NAT have not been established. Retrospective series have demonstrated that the elimination of PMRT
after NAT in high-risk patients, particularly those with stage III breast cancer, results in unacceptably high rates of recurrence, even in the setting of a pCR.10,11 For this reason, the role of PMRT generally is determined by clinical staging
before NAT without regard for the response to NAT. Risk factors for recurrence in this specific setting are not well
established.

Neoadjuvant Therapy and PMRT Outcomes/Wright et al

In addition, the role of regional lymph node irradiation in patients with breast cancer is increasingly controversial. In the postmastectomy setting, adjuvant radiation
has most commonly been defined as radiation of the chest
wall and regional lymph nodes, including supraclavicular
(SCV) and internal mammary (IMN) lymph nodes.
Although treatment of the SCV field is generally well tolerated, it can result in skin/cosmetic toxicities and
increased risk of brachial plexopathy, pneumonitis, lymphedema,12,13 and cardiac/cerebrovascular mortality.14
Thus, identification of patients who can safely have this
field omitted is desirable. However, to our knowledge, no
studies to date have assessed omission of the SCV field in
the setting of PMRT after NAT.
At our institution, use of the SCV field as a component of PMRT previously was not standardized, leading
to variation in clinical practice over the last 10 years, with
omission of the SCV field in selected patients. This variation in practice allows a meaningful, retrospective review
of outcomes in PMRT patients who received PMRT to
the chest wall with or without the SCV field. Our objectives were to identify predictors of LRR after NAT and
PMRT, to assess the patterns of use of the SCV field in
relation to clinical and pathologic lymph node status at
our institution, and to determine whether omission of the
SCV field in selected patients resulted in poorer survival
or a higher risk of LRR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective review was approved by the University
of Miami Institutional Review Board. A review of the
medical records of patients with breast cancer who
received PMRT between January 1999 and December
2009 at Jackson Memorial Hospital and at the University
of Miami’s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center identified 464 patients who received NAT. We collected data
on patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and clinical outcomes.
Breast cancer staging was determined clinically
based on physical examination at the time of diagnosis.
Tumor size was determined by physical examination or by
imaging studies if no palpable tumor was present. Patients
did not undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy before they
received NAT. Fine-needle aspiration of clinically suspicious axillary lymph nodes also was not standard during
the treatment period assessed but was performed in
selected patients, and clinically suspicious lymph nodes
that were negative on fine-needle aspiration were staged as
clinically negative (cN0).

Follow-up was calculated from the date of diagnosis.
The date of progression was selected as the date of first
event, including LRR, distant metastasis (DM), or death.
Local failure was defined as tumor recurrence in the chest
wall. Regional failure was defined as recurrence in the
axilla, internal mammary lymph nodes, or supraclavicular
fossa. Local failure and regional failure were defined together as LRR. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the earliest occurrence
of LRR, DM, or death from any cause. Overall survival
(OS) calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of
death from any cause, with surviving patients censored at
date of last contact. PFS and OS were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method. A pCR to NAT was defined as the
absence of invasive disease in the breast and axilla at the
time of surgery.
The incidence of LRR, with or without synchronous
distant failure (events <3 months apart), and the incidence of DM as first failure were estimated using the
method of cumulative incidence described by Gray using
the ‘‘cuminc’’ procedure in the R statistical package
‘‘cmprsk’’ (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria),15 with death as competing risk. The
effects of potential prognostic factors were examined using
the Gray test, which compares cumulative incidence
curves, or the test of Fine and Gray, which is based on the
competing risk Cox proportional hazards regression
method implemented in the ‘‘crr’’ procedure in the
‘‘cmprsk’’ package. Statistical analyses were conducted
using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC) and R software (version 2.15.0; The R Development
Core Team).
RESULTS
Patient and Disease Characteristics

Patient demographics and tumor characteristics are provided in Table 1. The median patient age at diagnosis was
50 years (range, 25-81 years), and 55% of patients were
premenopausal or perimenopausal. Twenty-five percent
of patients were black, 73% were white, 2% were Asian/
other, and 59% were Hispanic. Clinical stage at presentation was as follows: 5.8% of patients had stage IIA disease,
23.5% had stage IIB disease, 39.5% had stage IIIA,
26.1% had stage IIIB disease, and 5% had stage IIIC disease. Inflammatory disease was observed in 14.2% of
patients. Tumor histology was ductal in 81.9% of tumors,
lobular in 7.8%, medullary in 3.4%, metaplastic in 2.8%,
and other in 4.1%. Receptor status was as follows: 24% of
patients were positive for human epidermal growth factor
2 (HER2), 54% were positive for estrogen receptor (ER),

Treatment Characteristics

Treatment characteristics are summarized in Table 2. All
patients received NAT. Forty-four percent of patients
received a platinum salt/docetaxel/anthracycline as a component of their NAT regimen, 19.6% received anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy, 20% received
trastuzumab-containing regimens, and 16.2% received
other chemotherapy regimens. Among patients who had
HER2-overexpressing tumors, 83% received trastuzumab-containing therapy. All underwent mastectomy, and
98% underwent axillary lymph node dissection. A median
of 17 lymph nodes were removed in each patient. Three
patients had positive surgical margins. All patients
received radiation to the chest wall with or without
18

regional lymph nodes, and the median total chest wall
dose inclusive of boost was 60.4 grays (range, 46.8-74.4
grays). Radiation generally was delivered using medial
and lateral photon tangents with a 1-cm bolus placed over
the chest wall every other day; treatment of the internal
mammary lymph nodes rarely was performed; and, if
those lymph nodes were included, then the technique was
most commonly deep tangents. It is difficult to determine
the number of patients retrospectively who had the internal mammary lymph nodes included, but we estimate this
was done in <5% of patients. Radiation to the SCV field
was delivered by a standard anterior or anterior oblique
field, prescribed to a depth of 3 to 5 cm. The majority of
patients in this series received treatment using a 2-dimensional technique, with standard bony anatomic field
boundaries for the SCV field, including the transverse
process of the vertebral bodies medially, the match line

ted. Table 3 summarizes use of the SCV field in the entire
cohort and by clinical and pathologic lymph node-stage
combinations. The omission of the SCV field was significantly more common in lower clinical and pathologic
lymph node classification: 29.8% of 205 patients who
had pathologically negative lymph node status after NAT
had the SCV field omitted, whereas 46.3% of 80 patients
who had clinically and pathologically negative lymph
node status had the SCV field omitted. Delivery of both
chest wall and SCV radiation also was associated significantly with increasing clinical stage group, clinical T-classification, lack of pCR in the breast and axilla, and lack of
pCR in the axilla.
Clinical Outcomes

The median follow-up from the date of diagnosis was
45.9 months for all patients and 50.5 months for the
patients who remained alive with no evidence of disease.
In the whole cohort, the 4-year PFS rate was 76.5% (95%
confidence interval, 71.9%-80.5%), and the OS rate was
86.3% (95% confidence interval, 82.3%-89.5%).
The cumulative 4-year incidence of LRR with or
without synchronous DM as the first site of failure for
the entire cohort was 5.8% (95% confidence interval,
3.8%-8.4%), which occurred in 25 patients. There were
25 LRRs as the first site of failure, including 12 isolated
LRRs and 13 LRRs associated with synchronous distant
failure (6 events were diagnosed simultaneously, 4 events
were diagnosed <1 month apart, and 3 remaining events
were diagnosed <3 months apart). The failure events are
listed in Table 4. Among the total 25 LRRs, 16 were
recurrences in the chest wall only, 3 were recurrences in
the chest wall and regional lymph nodes, and 6 were regional lymph node recurrences only without chest wall
failure. Among 9 regional failures, 6 were recurrences in
the SCV field, and only 1 of those 6 recurrences developed in a patient who had the SCV field omitted.
Among the 6 SCV failures, 4 occurred in the setting of
inflammatory disease (the SCV field was treated in all 4
patients), 1 occurred in the setting of pathologic
ypT3N2 disease (the SCV field was treated), and 1
occurred in a patient who had clinically positive lymph
nodes but pathologically negative lymph nodes after
NAT and had the SCV field omitted. Six patients had
axillary failures, all 6 patients had received treatment to
the SCV field, and 5 of these 6 patients had triple-negative disease.
There were significant differences in several prognostic factors for LRR (Table 5). On univariate analysis,
predictors of LRR were higher clinical lymph node status

for positive pN status (HR, 10.23; P < .0001), triple-negative status (HR, 8.50; P < .0001), clinical stage III disease (2.56; P ¼ .108), and inflammatory presentation
(HR, 1.41; P ¼ .460).
The cumulative 4-year incidence of isolated DM as
the first site of failure for the entire cohort was 15.2%
(95% confidence interval, 11.8%-19%), occurring in 68
patients. Overall, there were 87 distant failures, including
13 failures that were synchronous with LRR, 6 failures after LRR, 68 patients who had isolated DM as the first failure, and a total of 68 deaths. There were significant
differences in the cumulative incidence of isolated DM by
several prognostic factors (Table 5). In univariate analysis,
predictors of DM as the first failure included higher clinical stage (P ¼ .009), inflammatory disease at presentation

(P ¼ .038), positive pathologic lymph node status (P <
.001), the combination of clinically and pathologically
positive lymph node disease (P ¼ .001), lack of a pCR in
the breast and axilla clinical (P ¼ .001), and residual pathologic tumor size >2 cm (P ¼ .003). Also in univariate
analysis, omission of the SCV field was associated marginally with the risk of isolated DM as the first failure (Gray
test: P ¼ .083 [Table 5]; HR, 0.51; Gray and Fine test: P
¼ .089) (Table 6). However, omission of the SCV field
lost its significance for predicting isolated DM (HR, 0.69;
P ¼ .360) in a model that was adjusted for lack of a pCR
in the breast and axilla (HR, 5.15; P ¼ .006), triple-negative status (HR, 1.15; P ¼ .62), clinical stage III disease
(HR, 1.87; P ¼ .067), and inflammatory presentation
(HR, 1.35; P ¼ .32). Omission of the SCV field was not
associated with PFS (P ¼ .078) or OS (P ¼ .462) on univariate analysis.
DISCUSSION
In this large retrospective series of patients with stage II
and III breast cancer who uniformly received NAT,
underwent mastectomy, and received PMRT, we identified multiple risk factors for LRR, including negative ER
status, negative PR status, triple-negative disease,
advanced clinical stage, and poor response to NAT. On
univariate analysis, omission of the SCV field was not
associated with an increased risk of LRR. However, omission of the SCV field became significantly associated with
an increased risk of LRR in multivariate analyses with
adjustment for other established risk factors, including triple-negative status, pCR in axilla, advanced stage at presentation, and inflammatory disease.
Triple-negative receptor status is emerging as a clear
negative prognostic indicator for LRR as well as PFS and
OS. An analysis of the Danish postmastectomy trials demonstrated that the locoregional control benefit of PMRT
was less in patients with triple-negative tumors,16 and our
own series demonstrated a higher risk of LRR after
PMRT in patients with triple-negative tumors.17 It
remains unclear whether triple-negative breast cancer is a
risk factor specifically for lymph node recurrence. Studies
suggest that lymph node-positive disease at presentation is
more common in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, and a retrospective series revealed that patients with
triple-negative tumors had a higher risk of isolated regional lymph node failure in the setting of early stage
breast cancer and breast-conserving therapy.18 In our
series, of 9 regional failures, 7 occurred in patients
with triple-negative disease. Because of the small
number of regional events, we were unable to assess

whether triple-negative breast cancer was a significant predictor of regional failure in particular, but the data overall
do suggest that this is an entity with a high risk of recurrence in all forms, and omission of the SCV field in this
patient subset should be avoided. However, because it
appears that PMRT is less effective in the setting of triplenegative disease, it is possible that comprehensive PMRT
alone is not sufficient. It is noteworthy that, in the setting
of treatment with trastuzumab for the majority of patients
with HER2-overexpressing tumors, HER2 overexpression
did not emerge as a risk factor for LRR.
The role of regional lymph node irradiation in
breast cancer has become increasingly controversial. The
recently published American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 study assessed the role of
completion axillary dissection in patients with very early
stage, low-risk breast cancer who had clinically negative
lymph nodes and 1 or 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes;
those patients received adjuvant radiation to the whole
breast using supine tangent fields (generally inclusive of a
substantial component of the level I/II axillary lymph
nodes), but not to the high axillary or supraclavicular
lymph nodes. In that study, there was no difference in
locoregional outcome between patients who underwent
completion axillary dissection and those who did not, and

the locoregional failure rates were very low despite omission of SCV radiation.19 A recent publication from
France evaluated the locoregional impact of omission of
the SCV field in patients who were lymph node-negative
at the time they underwent breast-conserving surgery after
NAT, regardless of the initial clinical lymph node status.
Those investigators observed no difference in locoregional
outcome or death with and without the receipt of regional
lymph node radiation.20 Conversely, the National Cancer
Institute of Canada (NCIC) MA.20 study, which
randomized patients who had more advanced disease than
the patients in ACOSOG Z0011 (the majority of had 1-3
positive lymph nodes) to receive whole breast radiation
with or without regional lymph node irradiation, demonstrated a decreased risk of LRR and a trend toward
improvement in OS with the addition of regional lymph
node irradiation.13 It is critical to note that the ACOSOG
Z0011 and NCIC MA.20 studies are not directly applicable to the patient population reviewed in our current
study, because our patients had more locally advanced disease than the patients in those 2 studies, and they received
NAT: Positive lymph node status after NAT has clearly
emerged as a more serious prognostic indicator than positive lymph node status at the time of up-front surgery.
However, as techniques for radiation delivery
improve and advances are made in systemic therapies, the
omission of radiation to ‘‘elective’’ fields has become more
common in disease sites, like the lung, pancreas, and
others, to maximize the therapeutic ratio of treatment.
The toxicity of regional lymph node irradiation, such as
skin/cosmetic toxicities; the risk of brachial plexopathy,
pneumonitis, lymphedema12,13; and the risk of cardiac/
cerebrovascular mortality are quite low. Nonetheless, the
omission of regional lymph node irradiation is desirable if
it does not offer patients a significant benefit. However,
our series suggests that treatment of regional lymph nodes
may have an impact on locoregional outcome. We were
not able to identify a subset of patients who received NAT
and underwent mastectomy and could safely received
treatment to the chest wall only with omission of the SCV
field. Although the rate of LRR was low at 5.8% in the
entire cohort, and there was a very low LRR rate (1.9%)
in patients who had pathologically negative lymph nodes
after NAT, our multivariate analysis demonstrated that
omission of the SCV field had a negative impact on the
risk of LRR in our cohort. The potential benefit of regional lymph node radiation is a reduction in the distant
failure rate, in addition to LRR, as demonstrated in the
NCIC MA.20 study.13 Regional lymph node radiation in
our series was not associated with distant failure and did
23

not have an impact on PFS, possibly because of the small
numbers of events.
Our study included only patients who received
PMRT; thus, we were not able to assess the overall benefit
of PMRT in this patient population. Although guidelines
for the use of PMRT after up-front surgery are relatively
well established, guidelines after NAT are less clear. Currently, common indications for PMRT after NAT include
a clinical tumor size >5 cm, clinically positive lymph
nodes, and/or residual lymph node disease after NAT;
generally, all patients with clinical stage III disease who
receive NAT are offered PMRT, and patients with stage II
disease usually are offered PMRT, depending on other
risk factors. The low rate of LRR in patients who achieved
an axillary pCR in our series, as well as that observed in
other series,11 suggests the possibility that PMRT may be
avoided altogether in patients who have a pCR to NAT,
and trials designed to assess possibility this are currently
being developed by cooperative groups.
It is important to note that, during the period covered in this review, breast cancer staging was determined
clinically, and pathologic assessment of axillary lymph
nodes before chemotherapy was not routinely performed.
At our center, we do not perform sentinel lymph node biopsy before NAT. Since 2009, we have adopted ultrasound staging with fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy
of clinically or radiographically suspicious lymph node(s)
before the initiation of NAT. Although this approach has
a lower sensitivity than sentinel lymph node biopsy, ranging from 28% to 56%,21,22 it does not have an impact on
subsequent surgical staging and does not delay treatment.
In addition, regional lymph node recurrence is likely
underestimated in this series, because dedicated imaging
is required to identify clinically occult recurrences and
was not routinely performed in our patients.
This series is limited by its reliance on retrospective
data and small patient numbers in each category of lymph
node status and SCV field use combinations. We view the
current data as a preliminary step toward well designed,
prospective studies that will assess the tailoring of radiation field selection to patients individually, with hormone
and HER2 status combinations as well as lymph node
response to NAT as factors in clinical decision-making
pathways, to determine whether any particular subset of
patients receiving NAT can safely have the SCV field
omitted from their PMRT treatment.
