ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic neoplasms and
an appropriate in vivo environment for myeloma cells has potential implications for
initiation, progression, and metastasis of MM. Exosomes, entities carrying microRNAs
(miRNAs) to target locations, participate in the cross-talk between myeloma cells
and nonmalignant components of the in vivo environment. This study disclosed the
emerging roles of circulating exosome-associated miRNAs in drug resistance (DR) of
MM. To this end, the medical records of consecutively hospitalized MM patients, who
received novel agents-based therapies, were analyzed. Then, an optimized procedure
was established for exosome isolation and exosomal RNA analysis. The exosomeassociated miRNA expression patterns for predicting bortezomib (Bz) resistance of
MM were further examined using a microarray. In total, 204 patients were enrolled
with DR rates of 36.5%, 73.1% and 81.8% in the bortezomib (Bz), thalidomide
and lenalidomide containing groups. The serum total light chain ratio  ≥  100,
CRP ≥ 20 mg/L, and the second-line usage increased risks of acquired Bz-resistance.
Among 68 cases having genetic tests, a high risk factor for predicting de novo DR was
1q21 amplification, which also correlated with lower levels of cholesterol and LDL-C.
Moreover, nano-sized exosomes were isolated with significantly increasing internal
RNAs and down-regulation of exosomal miR-16-5p, miR-15a-5p and miR-20a-5p,
miR-17-5p was revealed in the patients resistant to Bz. The routine workup of MM
hardly suggested a value for DR prediction. The circulating exosomes carrying miRNAs
provided a window that permits a better understanding of the in vivo intercellular
crosstalk in MM patients.

INTRODUCTION

human tumors and their microenvironment [11]. Thereby,
we hypothesized that the profile of exosomal miRNA
from peripheral blood, which can be easily available with
a minimally invasive procedure, had a predictive value of
primary or acquired drug resistance (DR) for MM patients.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common and lifethreatening hematological malignancy and is characterized
by uncontrolled growth and accumulation of monoclonal
plasma cells. These cells can infiltrate the bone marrow
(BM) and typically secrete monoclonal (M) proteins
into the peripheral circulation, resulting in related organ
and tissue injury (ROTI). The pathogenesis of MM is
largely attributed to the interplay between myeloma cells
and the in vivo environment, mostly the bone marrow
microenvironment (BMME). This interaction occurs
throughout the entire disease process, namely, from
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS), smoldering MM, symptomatic MM, and finally
to plasma cell leukemia (PCL) [1]. Conventional therapies
such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which
mainly focused on myeloma cells, result in a low complete
remission (CR) rate and short survival time in MM [2]. The
emerging novel therapies, including proteasome inhibitors
and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), can influence the
BMME of MM and have strikingly improved the survival
for MM patients [3–5]. However, resistance to novel drugs
tends to be a clinical frustration because nearly all MM
patients inevitably relapse or evolve to a refractory stage.
In addition to the biobehavioral changes of myeloma cells
of resisting drug challenges, BMME such as bone marrow
stromal cells (BMSCs), have been found to play a vital
role in drug resistance like bortezomib [6]. Thus, more
attention needs focused on the crosstalk between myeloma
cells and the in vivo environment, which may shed light
on understanding drug resistance in MM. Accordingly,
it is necessary to find some routine clinical markers that
reflect the in vivo environment directly correlated to a high
predictive value of DR.
We designed this study using the real world study
(RWS) method of using data for decision making that
was not collected in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), a
concept introduced in 2007 by the International Society
for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)
Task Force [7]. Additionally, due to focal distribution of
the disease it is difficult to obtain samples containing
myeloma cells and those that are obtained may lack
biomarkers that reflect MM [8]. Exosomes, which are
released into circulation from all cell types, are lipid
bilayer cup-shaped nanovesicles with 30–100 nm in
diameter and provide membrane protection for inclusive
RNAs and proteins [9]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), existing
naturally as the most biologically stable nucleic acid
molecule with only about 19–23 nucleotides, act as finetuning regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional
level through a complicated miRNA-mRNA interaction
[10]. Until now, emerging studies have suggested that
tumor-derived exosomes quantitatively predominate
in peripheral blood and exosome-mediated miRNA
transduction plays a pivotal role in the dialogue between

RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics
A total of 300 MM patients with 1826 episodes of
hospitalizations (with an average of 6.1 per patient per
year) were analyzed in our center. The median age of this
cohort was 61 years old, while the estimated median OS
was 83.9 months. As shown in Table 1, 68.0% (n = 204)
of patients with 1682 episodes of hospitalizations received
a novel agent-based regimen and were enrolled in the
study, among which, 56.4% (n = 115), 32.8% (n = 67)
and 10.8% (n = 22) were treated with Bz, thalidomide
and lenalidomide, respectively. Meanwhile, 32% (n = 96)
of the remaining patients were admitted for clinical trials
or supportive treatment. Bz and thalidomide were mainly
used as front-line therapy, while lenalidomide as salvage
therapy. In total, DR accounted for 53.4% (n = 109) of the
entire cohort with the lowest frequency of 36.5% (n = 42)
in the Bz group (p = 0.000).

Baseline data predicting DR for MM treated
with novel agents
As shown in Tables 2–3, the de novo DR group
accounted for 83.38% (n = 35) of the Bz-resistant group,
while 73.13% (n = 40) of the thalidomide-resistant
group. For the drug resistant cases receiving bortezomibcontaining regimens, compared with the response, also
called the sensitive group, the serum total light chain
ratio was higher than 100 or less than 0.01 RR = 34.286;
95% CI: 3.476–338.2 P = 0.001), CRP was greater than
20 mg/L (RR = 14; 95% CI: 1.23–158.84 P = 0.032), and
the second-line usage of bortezomib (RR = 9.667; 95% CI:
1.705–54.87; P = 0.009) was associated with an increased
risk for the occurrence of acquired resistance. However,
no significant indicators from the routine workup were
found between the response and primary resistant groups
capable of predicting the efficacy for the usage of either
Bz or thalidomide as well as between the response and
acquired thalidomide-resistant group.
As shown in Table  4, among 68 cases with
cytogenetic results in this cohort, a statistically significant
difference of a 1q21 gain frequency was found between
the response and de novo DR groups (RR:3.472,  95%
CI:1.184–10.179, p = 0.034). Moreover, patients with a
1q21 gain in the de novo DR groups were significantly
associated with lower levels of serum cholesterol
(p = 0.029) and LDL-C (p = 0.024) (shown in
Supplementary Table S1).

miR-21-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-15a-5p, miR16-5p were down-regulated. These differentially expressed
miRNA families play key roles in post-transcriptional
regulation by influencing transcription co-factors, the
MAP kinase pathway and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme
activity (Figure 2C). Furthermore, a miRNA-RNA
synergistic network was constructed to describe the role
of multiple exosomal miRNAs in the DR mechanisms
of complex post-transcriptional regulations in human
MM, which were by several miRNAs rather than a single
miRNA. We found that miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR15a-5p and miR-16-5p exhibited higher synergistic effects
(Figure 2D), indicating a functional complexity where a
global central core of the post-transcriptional regulatory
network is involved as a Bz-resistant mechanism of MM.
Levels of miR-16-5p, miR-15a-5p, miR-20a-5p and
miR-17-5p in the Bz-resistant group were 3.91, 1.83 and
2.96, 1.97 folds lower, respectively, than those in the Bzresponse group.

As shown in Figure 1B, TEM images and
NanoSight NS300 revealed the presence of nanosized, round EMVs, MVs and cup-shaped exosomes
isolated from the U-266 cell culture media, serum
of MM patients and healthy control. The purified
exosomes of less than 100  nm in diameter, which are
equipped with exosomal  marker  proteins CD63 and
HSP70 (Figure 1C), were more abundant in the serum
of MM patients than in healthy control. As shown
in Figure  2A, significant  differences  of  exosomal
RNA content were observed between the Bz-resistant
group and the Bz-response group (350.17 ± 37.55 ng/μl
vs 235.43 ± 3.91 ng/μl, p = 0.033) by Nanodrop analysis
and the exosomal RNA concentrations of both groups
were obviously higher than 78.21  ±  45.51  ng/μl of the
healthy control. Besides, we also isolated circulating
RNAs in plasma of patients in the Bz-resistant group and
the Bz-response group (Figure 2A–2D and Figure 2A–2F).
It showed that the exosomal RNA concentrations of both
groups were significantly higher than the circulating RNA
concentrations, respectively (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Early predication of DR has been playing an
increasingly important role in holistic treatment for
patients with MM, considering that nearly all patients
eventually relapse and refractory MM (RRMM) with
multidrug resistance is observed even with the use of
novel  treatment agents. Moreover, almost 20–30% of
MM patients have innate DR to Bz [12, 13]. The present
study showed that Bz and thalidomide were mainly used
as front-line therapies (67.2%, 71.3%, respectively)
and lenalidomide as a salvage therapy (72.7%),
differing from the management guideline for multiple
myeloma (Version4, 2015) published by the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). To some
extent, this may be associated with an overwhelming

expressed at higher levels and 88 miRNAs were expressed
at lower levels in Bz-resistant group (Figure 2B), and
more than 90% of these miRNAs had novel functions.

positives, we listed the top 10  miRNAs exhibiting the

Not valid

price advantage of thalidomide over lenalidomide in the
Chinese market and this may generally represent the
current MM treatment in China. In this study we explored
the potential factors responsible for the occurrence of Bz
and thalidomide DR.
Compared with the Bz-response groups, risk
predictors for an increased likelihood of acquired
resistance were in descending order, namely, abnormal
total serum light chain ratio (≤ 0.01 or ≥ 100), higher
CRP level (≥ 20  mg/L), and the second-line usage.
First, although the free light chain (FLC) ratio has been
increasingly used for monitoring MGUS evolving to MM
and early evaluation of Bz response, the test of FLC ratio
has not been widely available in the majority of Chinese
myeloma centers [14, 15]. Under such circumstances, the
clinical role of the total light chain ratio in Bz resistance
cannot be ignored. The total serum light chain detection in
this analysis was consistent with results from a published
retrospective study that speculated that reaching a normal
total light chain ratio may be sufficient to maintain a
stable phase of the disease and confer prolonged event
free survival (EFS) [16]. Second, a high level of CRP is
known to contribute to a high tumor burden, extensive
complications and poor prognosis in MM [17,  18].
In contrast, CRP may protect myeloma cells from
dexamethasone and melphalan-induced apoptosis in vitro
and in vivo [19]. A shorter time to progression was
correlated with an elevated CRP level during the use
of Bz-containing therapy, which suggested that a high
level of CRP was involved in the rapid progress due to
resistance to Bz [20]. Meanwhile, according to the up-todate data [21, 22], CRP elevation was one of the potential
side effects of Bz, especially for male patients older than
60 years old using the drug less than 1 month, but the
mechanisms of DR remain largely unknown. Thereby,
monitoring CRP changes is essential during Bz usage and
lowering CRP to the baseline level may offer a potential
way to alleviate the risk of Bz acquired resistance. In
reference to the inferiority of the second-line usage of
Bz for relapsed disease, the phase III VISTA trial and the
phase II RETRIEVE study analyzed the efficacy of Bz
retreatment after the initial response to Bz, with a response
rate (≥ PR) in the range of 21%–50% [23, 24]. In contrast,

Bz was approved by the FDA for treating relapsed MM
patients in 2003, this was due, to a large extent, to data
from 202 cases for whom previous therapies did not work,
including traditional the chemotherapy of thalidomide
or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
from 14 centers [25]. The response rate of second-line
usage of Bz for RRMM was 59% [26–29]. In this study,
the drug resistance rate to second-line usage of Bz was as
high as 54.5% (n = 18) for the whole RRMM and 50%
for the RRMM previously obtaining the Bz treatment. The
clonal evolution theory indicates that there are emerging
dominant clones that may now be drug resistance to the
same drug [21]. Until now, for RRMM, whether the
ineffective agent used previously could be reused for
MM has given rise to a heated debate and awaits further
investigation.
It has not been possible to assess the impact of
the in vivo environment in the subgroup of patients with
MM presenting de novo resistance to Bz, as well as both
primary and acquired DR to thalidomide. Prospective
and larger clinical trials are clearly needed to resolve this
issue. The use of precise medicine would be a promising
model providing tailored therapies to individual patients
especially when the in vivo microenvironment influences
the pathological processes via the interaction with MM
cancerous components that varies from patient to patient.
In addition, no correlation between DR and immune
status indicators (bone metabolism and bone disease
indicators) has been found in the multivariate analysis,
which may be partly explained by the limited number
of patients in our cohort and other factors should also be
taken into considerations, namely, 1) the sensitivity of
the measurements, for example, plain radiographs rather
than MRI may show false negative results for myelomainduced bone lesions, and 2) dynamic parameter tracking
for particular individuals .
The number of samples with genetic information has
been fairly limited. Among 63 cases with FISH results in
the cohort, the gain of 1q21 has been implicated as a risk
factor for conferring de novo DR of the new agents. In line
with this possibility, increasing evidence has suggested
that the 1q21 gain accounted for DR and poor OS [30, 31].
The 1q21 gain is also correlated  with lower levels of

serum cholesterol and LDL-C. In fact, metabolic pathways
in multiple myeloma are essential for the regulation of
DR [32], but based on genetic evidence, chromosome
1q21 was associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility in
Hong Kong Chinese [33].
Since there has not been a practical model from
the routine workup of MM to effectively predict DR,
we aimed to construct a model based on the differential
expression of exosomal miRNAs. Given that Bz is

the  most  widely  used  new drug for MM, exosomeassociated miRNA panels, reflecting the crosstalk
between MM cells and the in vivo environment,
were explored in this study by comparing the Bzresistance and Bz-response groups. Although in vivo
tracking of the exosomes in humans is challenging, a
conclusion is that the majority of the exosomes come
from myeloma cells because the significant elevation

exosomes.

both the myeloma subgroups to the healthy control
and the resistant group to the response group. The
microarray profiling found four exosomal miRNAs (miR16, miR-15a, miR-20a and miR-17) are at the core of the
miRNA-RNA regulatory signaling network predicted
by integrating network analysis and Gene Ontology
and were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Our
previous work and other findings suggest that downregulation of miR-15a and miR-16 of primary MM cells
as well as in MM cell lines could contribute to the DR
and progression by the modulation of the bone marrow
microenvironment [34, 35]. In addition, miR-20a and miR17 are also involved in the tumorigenicity of MM [36].
Although miR-15a  and miR-16 are located on 13q13.4
and miR-17-92 cluster of chromosome 13q31.3, their
expression is independent of the loss of chromosome 13,
which is observed in almost half of MM patients and
resulted in poor prognosis. Further prospective studies on
a larger cohort are required to clarify the potential role of
specific exosomal miRNAs, namely, miR-15a and miR16 with the putative BCL2 target and miR-20a and miR17 with the putative Myc target.
Our study has the important implication of using
serum exosomal miRNAs as drug resistance biomarkers
for MM. First, cell-free circulating RNAs have opened
a window to assess global alteration of the in vivo
disease and an extensive list of circulating RNA-based
biomarker candidates have been reported in the recent
years  [37,  38]. Significantly, in this study from the
equivalent blood sample of the same patients, obviously
higher concentrations of exosomal RNAs than circulating
RNAs were found, suggesting that more effort is necessary
to make a comprehensive assessment of the potential roles
of exosomal RNAs in human disease. Second, unlike
monogenic disorders such as chronic myeloid leukemia
with the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene [39],
MM is a complex polygenic trait shaped by multiple and
translocation genetic anomalies, thus leading to a more
obvious disease heterogeneity. The advances in systems
biology and the development of new molecular tools
in the “omics” science, including genomics, Rnomics,
miRNomics, proteomics and epigenomics, have made
it possible to reveal new findings in relation to DR in
MM patients. The expression panel of miRNAs that
are highly  stable  in blood and involved in a complex,
multi-faceted network of regulatory interactions
suggest that miRNAs may be the preferred option for
circulating biomarker for MM in routine clinical practice
since mRNAs and proteins are unstable molecules,
in constant alteration and dynamic  expression
of  mRNAs and proteins are  frequently  correlated  with
the events of each episode taking place within
extended periods of time. Although DNAs are biologically
stable, their mutations exert a great deal of diversity due
to the complexity of assembled genomic  clones and
biological subtypes among individual MM cases. Our
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

results still warrant further investigations because of
the limitation of number of miRNAs microarray in each
group and outside of Bz. Moreover, large multi-center
studies are needed to explore the more precise exosomeassociated microRNA expression models accompanying
the development of novel agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From January 2013 to December 2014, all the
hospitalized MM patients in our tertiary hematology
center, who received novel agents-based therapies,
namely, bortezomib (Bz), thalidomide or lenalidomide,
and did not participate in any clinical trials during
the corresponding period, were enrolled in this study.
This study was performed in accordance with the
1996 Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the
ethics committees of West China Hospital, Sichuan
University. The diagnosis of MM was established
using the International Myeloma Working Group
2003 diagnostic criteria [40]. The cut-off date for followup was March 31st, 2015. The median follow-up was
23 months with a median follow-up of 23 months, and 38
patients (19.1%) were lost from follow-up sessions.

Study design and treatment
The overall treatment for patients with MM was
divided into three phases: induction, consolidation
and maintenance. Thalidomide-base therapy of MPT
regimen specifically included melphalan orally 0.25 mg/
kg on days 1–4, prednisone orally 1 mg/kg on days
1–4 and thalidomide orally 50–200 mg/day, with over
4–6 weeks as per cycle. Bz-based therapy of BD regimen
specifically included Bz intravenously or subcutaneously
1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11 and dexamethasone orally
or intravenously 20 mg/day on days 1–2, 4–5, 8–9, 11–12 
with over 21-days per cycle. Lenalidomide-based therapy
of Rd regimen specifically included lenalidomide orally
25  mg/day on days 1–21 and dexamethasone orally
20  mg on days 1,  8,  15 and 22  with over 28-days per
cycle. After at least 4 cycles of induction treatment,
patients with partial remission or better response
underwent consolidation therapy, either autologous stem
cell transplant (ASCT) or chemotherapy with the initial
regimens, according to their intent and performance status.
Subsequently, the patients with good tolerance would be
treated with thalidomide (100–150 mg/day) for 1 year
for maintenance, if the drug was well tolerated. The role
of the in vivo environment was analyzed as contributors
to DR, while the data based on the routine workup for
MM were collected into 5 aspects as follows: (1) patients’
general information; (2) immune status indicators; (3)

markers; (5) genetic profile. More details are found in the
Tables.
DR was defined according to the criteria of the 19th
annual meeting of European Hematology Association.
Briefly, the patients were divided into two groups based
on therapeutic outcome: the response group and resistant
group. The latter were further divided into the de novo
drug resistant group (de novo DR) and the acquired
drug resistant group (acquired DR). The de novo DR
consisted of the patients who failed to achieve minimal
remission (MR) or experienced progressive disease
(PD) within 60 days when receiving the novel agentbased therapy for the first time, while the acquired DR
consisted of those who developed DR when receiving
the novel agent-based therapy and had previously been
treated with the drug. The response group represented
the patients who acquired partial remission (PR) or
complete remission (CR) no matter the first or second
line application of the novel agent-based regimen.
Duration of response was defined as the time from
the date of the first response to the date of PD or death
due to PD. Survival time was defined as the time from
diagnosis to the last follow-up or death.

and then use either 0.2-micrometer (μm) pore size filters
or artificially synthesized molecular sieves to enrich
exosomes. In this study, we isolated and purified exosomes
from both U266 cell line and MM samples, as depicted in
Figure 1A. Then, the size and morphology of EMVs were
observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM)
(hitachi H-600 Japan) after negatively staining by 2%
uranyl acetase. The size distribution of EMVs was traced
by NanoSight NS300 (Malvern company, Great Britain)
following manufacture protocols. Protein lysates of EMVs
were assessed by Coomassie staining and western blotting
for identification the expression of exosomal protein
marker such as heat shock protein (Hsp70), CD63 and
myeloma membrane-associated CD138.

RNA isolation and microRNA array profiling
Serum exosomal samples of 3 subjects were
selected and harvested, respectively, from Bz-response
and Bz-resistant groups. To extract circulating RNA
from plasma samples, the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma
Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from cells or
exosomes harvested from serum was isolated using TRIzol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quantity and quality of RNA
was evaluated by nanodrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000,
Nanodrop Technologies). An equal amount of 150  ng
RNA from the 3 subjects of the same group was mixed to
minimize differences among subjects within a group. Total
RNA from both groups was labeled with Hy3™ fluorescent
using the miRCURY™ Hy3™/Hy5™ Power labeling kit
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) following the procedure
described by the manufacturer. The Hy3™-labeled samples
were mixed and hybridized to the miRCURY™ LNA
Array version 7th Generation (Exiqon), covering all
human, mouse and rat miRNAs annotated in miRBase
18.0, as well as all viral microRNAs related to these
species. In addition, this array contains capture probes
for 25 miRPlus™ human miRNAs. The hybridization
was performed according to the miRCURY™ LNA array
manual. Then, the slides were scanned using the Axon
GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments,
Foster City, CA), and scanned images were then imported
into GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon) for grid alignment
and data extraction. Replicated miRNAs were averaged
and miRNAs that intensities > = 30 in all samples were
chosen for calculating normalization factor. Expressed
data were normalized using the Median normalization.
After normalization, differentially expressed miRNAs
were identified through Fold Change filtering. Hierarchical
clustering was performed using MEV software (v4.6,
TIGR). MicroRNA array experiments were performed by
the Shanghai KangChen Bio-tech Company, Shanghai,
China. Real-time PCR was used for confirmation.
Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified through
volcano plot screening. Cluster analysis was carried out by

Cell lines, cell culture and blood sample
collection
The human multiple myeloma U266 cell line
was purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in 5% CO2. For exosome
isolation, the U-266 was prepared with 10% SBI EXOFBS-50A-1 Exosome-depleted FBS media supplement.
Blood samples of the patients who would receive Bzbased regimen were collected into EDTA-coated tubes
and in the same day processed under a protocol approved
by the Institutional Review Board in Sichuan University,
West China Hospital. Blood samples of the patients who
preferred to receive the novel drug-based regimen were
collected with written informed consent.

Exosome isolation and identification
Extracellular membrane microvesicles (EMVs) are
circulating fragments of membrane, including exosomes,
which are released from the endosomal compartments
with diameters of 30 to 100 nm and microvesicles (MVs),
which are shedding from the surface membranes of most
cell types with diameters of 50 to 2,000 nm. Until now,
even differential ultracentrifugation, the gold standard
method for separating and purifying EMVs, is incapable
of efficiently distinguishing between exosomes and
MVs. Alternatively, based on the principle of aqueous
gradient solubility differences between various lipids and
nanoparticles, commercial kits are able to capture EMVs

hierarchical clustering. Finally, a fold change analysis was
performed by calculating the ratio between the two groups
with a cut-off value of 2-fold changes. The mechanism
of miRNA differentially expressed between groups were
further explored by Ontology (GO) classification analyses
through evaluating the genes affected by the upregulated
and downregulated miRNAs, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for pathway analysis were
also employed to estimate the functions and pathways
of miRNAs target genes.
