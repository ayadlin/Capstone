ABSTRACT
Impaired PTEN function is a genetic hallmark of aggressive prostate cancers
(CaP) and is associated with increased CXCL8 expression and signaling. The current
aim was to further characterize biological responses and mechanisms underpinning
CXCL8-promoted progression of PTEN-depleted prostate cancer, focusing on
characterizing the potential interplay between CXCL8 and other disease-promoting
chemokines resident within the prostate tumor microenvironment. Autocrine CXCL8stimulation (i) increased expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in PTEN-deficient CaP cells
suggesting a self-potentiating signaling axis and (ii) induced expression of CXCR4 and
CCR2 in PTEN-wild-type and PTEN-depleted CaP cells. In contrast, paracrine CXCL8
signaling induced expression and secretion of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12
from prostate stromal WPMY-1 fibroblasts and monocytic macrophage-like THP-1
cells. In vitro studies demonstrated functional co-operation of tumor-derived CXCL8
with stromal-derived chemokines. CXCL12-induced migration of PC3 cells and CCL2induced proliferation of prostate cancer cells were dependent upon intrinsic CXCL8
signaling within the prostate cancer cells. For example, in co-culture experiments,
CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling but not CCL2/CCR2 signaling supported fibroblast-mediated
migration of PC3 cells while CXCL12/CXCR4 and CCL2/CCR2 signaling underpinned
monocyte-enhanced migration of PC3 cells. Combined inhibition of both CXCL8 and
CXCL12 signaling was more effective in inhibiting fibroblast-promoted cell motility
while repression of CXCL8 attenuated CCL2-promoted proliferation of prostate cancer
cells. We conclude that tumor-derived CXCL8 signaling from PTEN-deficient tumor
cells increases the sensitivity and responsiveness of CaP cells to stromal chemokines
by concurrently upregulating receptor expression in cancer cells and inducing stromal
chemokine synthesis. Combined chemokine targeting may be required to inhibit their
multi-faceted actions in promoting the invasion and proliferation of aggressive CaP.

INTRODUCTION

cellular activity is to regulate the phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Allelic loss,
epigenetic silencing and/or acquisition of functionallyinactivating mutations have all been shown to contribute
to the impairment of PTEN in prostate cancer [2,3].
Elegant in vivo genetically-engineered mouse models
have shown that heterozygous or homozygous deletion
of PTEN in the prostate epithelium [4] or alternatively,
constitutive activation of the downstream effector PKB/
Akt [5] underpins the development of a prostate pathology
recapitulating human prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia

Large scale sequencing and molecular pathology
analysis is providing deeper insight into the genetic
underpinnings of prostate cancer, heightening anticipation
of near-term and widespread access to precisionbased therapy of prostate cancer [1]. One of the best
characterized common genetic events in prostate cancer
relates to the impaired function of PTEN, a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene, whose primary

(PIN), a pre-malignant condition. In further experimental
models, the combination of PTEN loss with ERG overexpression or Tp53 mutation has been shown to promote
the transition to invasive prostate carcinoma [6,7] while
epidemiological studies conform the relevance of PTEN to
aggressive prostate cancer [8]. In support of this, a recently
published longitudinal molecular pathology analysis
indicated that mutation of PTEN was associated with
the lethal phenotype of prostate cancer [9]. Furthermore,
other recent studies support that functional loss of PTEN is
correlated with the relapse of prostate cancer after radical
prostatectomy or radiotherapy [10,11]. Therefore, while
pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggests that increased
signaling of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway is considered to
be a sustaining drive in the development and progression
of this disease, our understanding of the key biological
mediators and microenvironment responses that underpin
and define the more aggressive behavior of PTEN-depleted
prostate cancer remains to be fully defined.
Chemokines are critical signaling mediators, driving
communication between malignant epithelial cells and the
surrounding microenvironment, and contribute to multiple
hallmarks of cancer. Overexpression and increased
activity of three specific chemokines termed CCL2,
CXCL12 and CXCL8 have been strongly implicated
in the progression of prostate cancer [12-14]. Increased
expression and activity of CCL2 and CXCL12 has been
reported in both the localized prostate cancer and within
the microenvironment of bone metastases [13-18], while
prior work from our own group has confirmed elevated
CXCL8 expression in human prostate cancer tissue [19].
Our recent research has established an important
contextual relationship of impaired PTEN function to
the over-expression of CXCL8 in prostate tumor cells.
Conversely, modulation of this tumor suppressor gene had
no impact on the expression of either CCL2 or CXCL12
in prostate cancer cells [20]. Other studies report that
expression of CCL2 and CXCL12 may originate from
stromal cells and regulate tumor cell behavior through
promotion of paracrine signaling [12,13,15,18,21].
Therefore, the initial objective of this study was to
establish the existence of interplay between tumor-derived
CXCL8 from PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells and
the potentiation of stromal-derived CCL2 and CXCL12
expression and/or signaling. Our further objective was to
characterize the functional consequences of this interplay
in the context of augmenting the proliferation and/or
migration of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells. In this
study, we report a co-operative role between CXCL8 and
stromal-derived chemokines, establishing a multi-faceted
chemokine cross-talk between PTEN-deficient tumor
and stroma that sustains the proliferation, migration and
invasion of these aggressive prostate cancer cells.

CXCL8 signaling regulates chemokine receptor
expression in the prostate epithelium
Our prior studies demonstrated that silencing
of PTEN expression increased the transcription and
secretion of CXCL8 and increased gene expression of the
receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 in prostate cancer cells
[20]. In the current study, our initial experiments sought to
investigate how elevated levels of CXCL8 signaling may
regulate chemokine receptor expression in the prostate
epithelium. The ability of the recombinant-human CXCL8
(rh-CXCL8) stimulus to regulate chemokine receptor
expression was studied in representative androgensensitive (LNCaP and 22Rv1) and castrate-resistant
(PC3 and DU145) cell lines. QPCR analysis confirmed
that exogenous rh-CXCL8 administration significantly
increased CXCR1 (Fig 1A, left panel) and CXCR2 (Fig
1A, right panel) mRNA expression in the PTEN-null
PC3 and LNCaP cells. No change in CXCR1 or CXCR2
mRNA expression was detected in PTEN-expressing
DU145 or 22Rv1 cells (Fig 1A). The importance of PTEN
in regulating this response was exemplified using isogenic
lines. Administration of rh-CXCL8 induced CXCR1/2
mRNA expression in a PTEN-depleted clone (sh11.02)
but not a PTEN-expressing (NT.01) clone of the DU145
cell line (Figure S1A). Furthermore, immunoblotting
confirmed the CXCL8-stimulated increase in CXCR1
and CXCR2 receptor expression in PC3 and LNCaP cells
(Fig 1B). Therefore, these initial experiments suggest
that CXCL8 signaling can potentiate expression of the
receptors transducing its biological activity in PTENdeficient prostate carcinoma cells.
The effect of CXCL8 on expression of CCR2
and CXCR4 was also investigated. Stimulation with
rh-CXCL8 increased CCR2 mRNA expression in both
castrate-resistant cell lines, irrespective of their PTEN
status (Fig 1C, left panel), and in each of the androgensensitive lines, LNCaP and 22Rv1 (Fig 1C, left panel).
Similarly, rh-CXCL8 signaling increased CXCR4 mRNA
levels in all four cell lines relative to un-stimulated
controls (Fig 1C, right panel). Furthermore, QPCR
analysis demonstrated that the magnitude of increased
CCR2 and CXCR4 mRNA expression was similar in the
isogenic DU145 11.02 and NT.01 clones, supporting that
CXCL8-induced regulation of these chemokine receptors
is independent of PTEN expression (Fig S1B). We also
determined that CXCL8 signaling increased CXCR7
mRNA expression, a further receptor shown to mediate the
biological activity of CXCL12 (Fig S1C). QPCR data was
confirmed by immunoblotting analysis, which confirmed
CXCL8-induced up-regulation of CXCR4 receptor protein
expression in PC3 and LNCaP cells (Fig 1B). Therefore,

our data indicates that CXCL8 signaling originating from
PTEN-deficient tumor cells increases the expression of
CCR2 and CXCR4 in prostate epithelium, but of potential
significance, we observed that the expression of these
receptors can be induced in prostate epithelial cells that
still retain functional PTEN and have the capacity to
respond to CXCL8.

Basal mRNA expression for CCL2 (Fig 2A, left panel)
and CXCL12 (Fig 2A, right panel) was lower in each of
the prostate cancer cell lines relative to the expression
detected in the WPMY-1 prostate stromal fibroblast or
the monocytic THP-1 cell lines. Furthermore, qPCR
analysis revealed no change in CXCL12 (Fig S2A) or
CCL2 (Fig S2B) mRNA expression following stimulation
with rh-CXCL8 in any of the prostate cancer cell lines
studied; moreover, we observed that the secretion of either
CCL2 or CXCL12 from any of the prostate cancer cells
was below the limits of detection of the ELISA assays
employed. However, basal secretion of these chemokines
from the representative stromal cell lines was easily
detectable (Fig S2C).

CXCL8 signaling regulates CCL2 and CXCL12
expression and secretion in prostate stromal cells
Further experiments focused on characterizing the
regulation of CXCL12 and CCL2 across our panel of
prostate cancer cells and representative stromal cell lines.

Expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was also
detected in the stromal cell lines and this was up-regulated
in response to CXCL8 stimulation, demonstrating
their responsiveness to CXCL8 stimulation (Fig S2D).
Moreover, we observed a significant increase in CCL2
mRNA expression (Fig 2B, left panel) and secretion (Fig
2C, left panel) from macrophage-like THP-1 cells as well
as WPMY-1 and 293T cells (both fibroblast-like cell lines)
following exposure to rh-CXCL8. Increased CXCL12
mRNA expression was detected to varying degrees in

CXCL8-stimulated THP-1, 293T and WPMY-1 cells
(Fig 2B, left panel). CXCL12-secretion was significantly
increased from both fibroblast-like cell lines including the
prostatic fibroblast WPMY-1 but was undetectable from
THP-1 cells (Fig 2C, right panel).
Basal expression of CCR2 and CXCR4 was also
detected in each of the stromal cell lines (Fig S2E). Given
the effect of CXCL8 in regulating expression and secretion
of CCL2 and CXCL12 from these stromal cells, we also
extended our analysis and confirmed that CCR2 (Fig

2D, left panel) and CXCR4 (Fig 2D, right panel) mRNA
expression by each of these stromal cell lines was also upregulated in response to CXCL8 stimulation.
Our initial data suggests that stromal rather than
prostate cancer cells are the principal source of CCL2 and
CXCL12. Moreover, the release of CXCL8 from PTEN-

depleted prostate cancer cells may act in a paracrine
manner to increase the expression and secretion of CCL2
and CXCL12 from neighboring stromal cells. In contrast,
autocrine CXCL8 signaling increases the expression of
CCR2 and CXCR12 in prostate epithelium but does not
appear to affect expression of the chemokine ligands.

Collectively, this data indicates that CXCL8 signaling may
initiate signaling that results in increasing the sensitivity of
prostate epithelium to stromal-derived chemokine signals.

To explore the significance of CXCL8-promoted and
stromal-derived chemokine signaling on prostate
cancer cell-migration, we established a series of in vitro
experiments to characterize the functional importance
of CXCL8, CXCL12 and CCL2 as independent and codependent migratory factors within the prostate tumor
microenvironment.
Using wound scratch assays, we observed no change
in the migratory potential of PC3 cells when stimulated
with CXCL12 (100ng/ml) or CXCL8 (3nM) alone (Fig
3A & 3B). However, a significant increase in wound

CXCL8, CCL2 and CXCL12 play differential
roles in potentiating the chemotactic migration of
prostate cancer cells
Local tumor migration and invasion plays an
important role in metastasis and therapeutic relapse.

closure was observed when PC3 cells were co-stimulated
with CXCL8 and CXCL12. This migratory response to
CXCL8 and CXCL12 was abrogated by administration of
the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (Fig 3A & 3B).
This co-dependent effect of CXCL8 and CXCL12
was supported in further experiments. Use of a traditional
Boyden chamber experiment confirmed that migration
towards a CXCL12 stimulus (lower chamber) was only
observed following the addition of CXCL8 to the upper
chamber of the apparatus (Fig S3, left panel). Moreover,

experiments conducted over an extended timecourse on
the Xcelligence platform demonstrated an increased rate
of migration of CXCL8-stimulated PC3 cells towards
CXCL12 (Fig S3, right panel).
In contrast, the effect of CCL2 upon PC3 cell
migration was more complex. Addition of CCL2 (100ng/
ml) alone significantly enhanced the rate of wound closure.
However, although CCL2 and CXCL8 together increased
the migratory potential of PC3 cells over control, the effect
was not as dramatic as that exerted by CCL2 alone (Fig

3C & 3D, left panel). CCL2-promoted PC3 cell motility
was arrested by the administration of the CCR2 antagonist
RS102895 (Fig 3D).
Similar experiments were performed on isogenic
DU145 clones. We observed a significant increase in
wound closure when PTEN-expressing DU145 NT.01
and PTEN-depleted DU145 11.02 cells were cultured
with CXCL8 in combination with CXCL12(Fig S4),
eliminating the potential that this response was specific to
PC3 cells. Thus, our experiments indicate that CXCL8 and
CXCL12 signaling co-operate to accelerate the migration
of prostate cancer cells.

PC3 cells (Fig 4A). Addition of the CXCR4-selective
antagonist AMD3100 significantly attenuated this
response, confirming the importance of CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling in enabling this fibroblast-enhanced migration.
Similarly, inhibition of CXCL8 signaling using a peptidebased receptor-targeting pepducin (x1/2pal-i3) [22] was
also shown to significantly attenuate the WPMY-1-induced
migration of PC3 cells (Fig 4B). In a further series of
parallel experiments, we observed that while targeting
either the tumor-derived signaling stimulus, CXCL8
(using x1/2pal-i3), or the fibroblast-derived enabler
of migration, CXCL12 (using AMD3100), attenuated
the migration of PC3 cells to similar extents, a trend
towards more effective attenuation of WPMY-1-promoted
wound closure was observed following the simultaneous
administration of both AMD3100 and x1/2pal-i3 (Fig 4C).
Addition of THP-1 cells also promoted PC3
wound closure (Fig 5A/B). Interestingly, this response
was inhibited by addition of x1/2pal-i3 pepducin while
administration of AMD3100 had no effect, consistent
with our observation that THP-1 cells do not secrete
detectable levels of CXCL12. Addition of the CCR2
inhibitor RS102895 attenuated both THP-1- and WPMY1-promoted migration of PC3 cells (Fig 5C), consistent
with the secretion of CCL2 from each of these stromal

Co-culture experiments were conducted to examine
whether CXCL8-induced increases in stromal cell-derived

migration. CXCL8-secreting PC3 cells were co-cultured
overnight with either THP-1 or WPMY-1 cells prior to
wound scratch assays, allowing signaling between tumor
and stromal cells to be established.
WPMY-1 cells acted to promote the migration of

cells.

Consistent with our earlier results indicating that CXCL8
signaling up-regulated CCR2 and CXCR4 expression
in prostate cancer cells, we observed that the reduction
in autocrine CXCL8 expression resulted in a significant
decrease in CCR2 and CXCR4 mRNA expression in PC3120 cells (Fig S5C). Growth curve analysis demonstrated
that there was no significant difference in the basal growth
rate observed between parental PC3, PC3-NT and PC3120 cells (Fig S5D). Stimulation of PC3-NT cells with
rh-CCL2 promoted cell proliferation to a similar extent
as observed in parental PC3 cells (Fig 6D, left panel).
In contrast, CCL2 had no effect on growth of the low
CXCL8-expressing PC3-120 cells (Fig 6D, left panel).
Addition of RS012895 attenuated CCL2-promoted
growth of PC3-NT cells, but there was no effect on the
proliferation of PC3-120 cells (Fig 6D, right panel).

CXCL8, CXCL12 and CCL2 have differential
impacts on the proliferation and survival of
prostate cancer cells.
We investigated the role of CXCL8, CCL2 and
CXCL12 in regulating the growth and survival of
prostate cancer cells, independently or in a co-dependent
manner. Stimulation of PC3 cells with CCL2 resulted in a
concentration-dependent increase in the proliferation rate.
In contrast, stimulation with increasing concentrations of
CXCL12 inhibited the proliferation rate of PC3 cells (Fig
S5A). Accordingly, further experiments investigated the
importance of stromal-derived CCL2 signaling on prostate
cancer cell proliferation/viability.
Treatment with the CCR2 antagonist RS102895
significantly reduced the viability of PC3 cells in both a
cell count assay (Fig 6A) and a MTT assay (Fig S5B).
Cell cycle analysis demonstrated a significant increase
in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle following administration of RS102895 (Fig 6B, left
panel). However, inhibition of CCL2 signaling using this
antagonist did not increase the level of apoptotic cells
detected by PI/annexin V-labelling (Fig 6B, right panel).
Consistent with our published reports, the inhibition of
CXCL8 signaling using x1/2pal-i3 similarly reduced
the viability of PTEN-depleted PC3 cells (Fig 6A & Fig
S5B). However, we observed no additional benefit from
co-administering RS102895 and x1/2pal-i3 in the context
of reducing cell viability (Fig 6A). As further internal
validation of our data, treatment with the CXCR4 inhibitor
AMD3100 had no effect on basal cell number relative to
untreated controls or in affecting the viability of the PC3
cells in MTT assays (Fig 6C & Fig S5B).

DISCUSSION
PTEN-deficiency is a major molecular hallmark
of prostate cancer [4]. We have associated increased
expression and secretion of the pro-inflammatory CXCchemokine CXCL8 with loss of PTEN function in prostate
cancer cells and prostatic tissue [20]. Furthermore, loss
of PTEN function concurrently increased the expression
of CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), with the
resulting elevated autocrine CXCL8 signaling acting
to sustain the viability of these PTEN-deficient prostate
cancer cells [20]. Beside their elevated expression in
PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells, CXCR1 and CXCR2
are also expressed on vascular endothelial cells, monocytes
and fibroblasts [24,25]. Therefore, each of these cell
types within the tumor microenvironment is potentially
receptive to the increased levels of CXCL8 secreted by
PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells. The objective of
this study was to characterize the functional importance,
and molecular basis, of CXCL8-promoted tumor-stromal
communication in promoting the aggressiveness of PTENdeficient prostate cancer cells, with a specific focus on
understanding how tumor-derived CXCL8 may regulate
the expression of stromal-derived chemokines.
Our data highlights a co-ordinated response of
tumor and stromal cells to the secretion of CXCL8
from malignant prostate cancer cells. Autocrine CXCL8
signaling was shown to-upregulate the expression of
chemokine receptors in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly,
CXCL8 signaling increased the expression of CXCR1
and CXCR2 receptors in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer
cells, suggesting that CXCL8 signaling acts in a selfsustaining capacity, to potentiate its signaling in PTENdeficient prostate cancer. Furthermore, CXCL8 signaling
also increased the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 (the
receptors mediating the biological activity of CXCL12)
and CCR2 (a receptor activated by the ligand CCL2)
in both PTEN-expressing and PTEN-deficient prostate
cancer cells.

Autocrine CXCL8 signaling augments sensitivity
of PC3 cells to CCL2 stimulation
Elevated
CXCL8
expression
and
the
characterization of autocrine signaling effects of CXCL8
in PC3 cells is well-documented [20,23]. We developed
further derivative PC3 models to investigate how the
levels of autocrine CXCL8 signaling may augment the
ability of CCL2 to enhance cell proliferation. PC3 cells
were transfected with a CXCL8-targeted shRNA. While
transfection protocols with shRNA did result in the loss
of PC3 viability, we were able to select a small number
of residual populations; CXCL8 expression within the
selected populations was characterized by qPCR analysis
and ELISA. For the purpose of this study, a population
with CXCL8 expression equivalent to parental PC3 cells
(PC3-NT) and a population in which CXCL8 expression
was repressed by ~25% relative to PC3-NT levels (PC3120; Fig S5C) were used in further experimentation.

While CXCL8 was unable to induce chemokine
synthesis in prostate cancer cells, CXCL8 signaling
did increase CXCL12 and CCL2 synthesis in prostate
stromal fibroblasts and monocytes. Elevated CXCL12
secretion was observed from cells of fibroblast origin
while increased CCL2 secretion was demonstrated
in fibroblasts and monocytes. CXCL8 signaling also
increased CXCR4 and CCR2 expression in these stromal
cells. Although we have not investigated the significance
of these concurrent increases in chemokine ligand and
receptor expression upon the function of the stromal
cells themselves, it is conceivable that this elevated
chemokine signaling may regulate stromal cell function.
For example, CCL2 is known to drive the differentiation
of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype [26], typically
associated with a tumor progression. Moreover, CCL2 can
drive the infiltration of lymphocyte populations [27]. We
propose that, in addition to immediate impacts on tumor
cells, tumor-derived CXCL8 may also initiate sustained,
long-term effects on the tumor microenvironment, by
activating resident stromal cells, which, in turn, may
act to either directly remodel the tumor site or promote
the recruitment of additional cell types. Previous studies
have also demonstrated the importance of fibroblastderived CXCL12 in the evasion of immunosurveillance
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [28]. Our current
findings propose that tumor-derived CXCL8, through the
regulation of fibroblast-derived CXCL12 production, may
drive immune evasion in prostate cancer.
CXCL8 did not promote migration of prostate
cancer cells; elevated secretion of CXCL8 by prostate
tumors results in locally high levels of this chemokine
which in turn may prevent the establishment of a
chemotactic CXCL8 gradient. Instead, integrating our
observations in tumor and stromal cell lines, we propose
that tumor-derived CXCL8 signaling initiates a coordinated chemokine-driven cross-talk between tumor
and stromal cells (Fig 7). Our data demonstrates that
tumor-derived CXCL8 acts to increase the secretion of
stromal-derived chemokines which then activate the
increased pool of their respective receptors expressed
on the surface of prostate cancer cells. Ultimately, the
combined effect is that CXCL8 signaling increases the
sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to stromal-derived
chemokines. Our functional experiments establish that
CXCL12 and CCL2 act upon prostate cancer cells to
induce very different responses. While CXCL12 was
clearly implicated in supporting fibroblast-dependent
migration of PC3 cells, CCL2 signaling was observed to
be more effective in underpinning monocyte-dependent
proliferation of the malignant cells. For either of these
phenotypes, we observed that the efficacy of the stromalderived chemokine required the presence of tumor-derived
CXCL8 signaling (Fig 7). For example, in migration
assays, addition of both CXCL8 and CXCL12 was
necessary in order to observe migration. Furthermore, PC3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells expressing lower levels of CXCL8 were insensitive
to the proliferation-promoting effects of CCL2. We
propose these results indicate the importance of CXCL8driven CXCR4 and CCR2 expression in the prostate
cancer cells, which increases their capacity to respond to
each of these stromal-derived chemokines.
Addition of fibroblasts and macrophages promoted
the migration and invasion of PC3 cells. CXCL12/
CXCR4 signaling was shown to support fibroblastmediated migration and invasion of PC3 cells in coculture assays but not that promoted by macrophage-like
cells. Moreover, combined inhibition of both CXCL8
and CXCL12 signaling was more effective in repressing
fibroblast-promoted cell motility. In contrast, although
CCL2 signaling had only a minor effect on macrophageinduced prostate cancer cell motility, this chemokine had
significant effects upon the proliferation and survival
of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells. Furthermore,
repression of CXCL8 signaling reduced the sensitivity
of prostate cancer cells to these effects of CCL2. These
observations have important considerations in the context
of chemokine signaling as therapeutic interventions.
Specifically, our data suggests that targeting of only
one chemokine signaling axis may not be sufficient to
adequately suppress independent functional responses.
Furthermore, given the interplay between tumor-derived
and stromal-derived chemokines, we propose that cotargeting of multiple chemokine pathways may be
required in order to diminish multiple behavioral traits
of aggressive PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells.
Therefore, combined targeting of CXCR1/CXCR2,
CXCR4 and CCR2 signaling may be necessary in order to
deliver concurrent inhibition of stroma-promoted invasion
and proliferation.
In summary, we report the characterization of a
CXCL8-driven augmentation of CXCL12 and CCL2
signaling arising from different compartments of the
tumor-associated stroma, which act to sustain the
hallmarks of increased cell motility (migration and
invasion) and increased cell proliferation and survival.
Our study complements prior studies which have reported
the significance of stromal-derived CXCL12 signaling in
driving the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancers
[14,29], and provides a more-detailed understanding
of how stromal-derived chemokine signaling may be
induced. We propose this chemokine cross-talk has
greatest relevance to foci of PTEN-deficient prostate
cancers which secrete higher levels of CXCL8 in order
to trigger the induction of stromal chemokine synthesis.
Dedicated studies employing immune-competent
transgenic models of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer are
underway in our laboratory to provide greater insight into
the potential consequences of this chemokine signaling
cross-talk in driving the aggressiveness of PTEN-deficient
prostate carcinomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR)
RNA was harvested and reverse transcribed as
previously described using specified primer sequences
[20]. Real-time PCR was performed in 96-well plates
using an LC480 light cycler instrument (Roche
Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK). MRNA expression levels
were determined using the relative standard curve method
and normalized against 18S.

Chemical and Reagents
Chemicals were source from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.

Cell Culture and Treatments

Immunoblotting

Prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, LNCaP
and 22Rv1) or clones were sourced, derived and
cultured as previously described [20]. Fibroblast (293T,
human embryonic kidney; WPMY-1, prostate stroma)
cell lines were maintained in DMEM (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
calf serum (FCS; GIBCO BRL/Life Technologies, Paisley,
Scotland). Human macrophage-like THP-1 cells were
maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS and
0.05M β-mercaptoethanol. All cell lines were maintained
at 37oC.
In experiments investigating CXC-chemokine
signaling, cells were incubated in serum-free, phenolred free RMPI 1640 or DMEM medium for 16h prior to
exposure to 3nM recombinant human (rh)-CXCL8, 100ng/
ml rh-CXCL12 or 100ng/ml rh-CCL2 (Peprotech, London,
UK). For inhibition of chemokine signaling, cells were
treated with RS102895 (CCR2 antagonist, 10nM; Tocris,
Bristol, UK), AMD3100 (CXCR4 antagonist, 25µg/ml;
Tocris) or a CXCR1/2-derived pepducin (x1/2pal-i3,
300nM; Biomatik, Wilmington, Delaware). Control cells
were treated with the appropriate vehicle or NT-pepducin
(x1/2pal-con) sequence as required.

Whole cell lysates were prepared, resolved and
blotted as described previously [20]. CXCR4 expression
was detected using an anti-human CXCR4 antibody
(Abcam) at 1:1000. Expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2
were detected as previously described [30]. Membranes
were re-probed with GAPDH antibody to ensure equal
loading (Biogenesis, Dorset, UK).

ELISA
The amount of secreted CCL2 (Biolegend, London,
UK) or CXCR12 (R&D systems, Abringdon, UK) detected
in the medium of prostate cancer cells was determined
using an ELISA assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

MTT Assay and Cell Count Analysis
Cells were plated and treated with chemokines or
chemokine inhibitors for 48h or 72h as required. Cell
number was assessed by Coulter Counter [30] while cell
viability was assessed by MTT assay [31].	

Generation of PC3-120 cells

Cell cycle Analysis

CXCL8-depleted PC3‑120 and corresponding PC3NT cells were generated by stable downregulation of
CXCL8 using commercially available CXCL8-targeted
shRNA and non-targeting plasmids (HuSH constructs
in pGFP‑V‑RS vector; Origene, Rockville, MD, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
PC3 cells (5 x 105) were incubated in a transfection
mix containing plasmid (2μg), Lipofectamine 2000 and
OptiMEM medium (GIBCO BRL/Life Technologies).
Following 24h, cells were reseeded and populations
containing the shRNA plasmids were selected using
puromycin (0.5μg/ml). PC3-NT and PC3-120 cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% FCS and 0.5μg/ml puromycin.

PI staining and cell cycle analysis was performed as
previously described [30].

Apoptosis Assay

[20].

Apoptosis was measured as previously described

Migration Assays
Wound scratch assays were performed on confluent
monolayers of prostate cancer cells. Prostate cancer cells
were treated and/or co-cultured with stromal cell lines
as required prior to a regular scratch being made in the
prostate cell monolayer. Plates were observed and imaged
4906

Oncotarget

using Cell B software (Olympus; Southend-on-Sea, UK)
incubated for the required length of time and imaged
again. Wounds were measured using ImageJ software and
the degree of wound closure calculated.
Migration assays were performed on uncoated
transwell membranes (12µM pore size; CoStar). Cells
were seeded with media alone or stimulated with media
containing 3nM CXCL8 and allowed to migrate towards
media alone or media containing 100ng/ml CXCL12 for
20h before the membranes were stained with crystal violet
and the absorbance of each well calculated.
Cell movement through a synthetic matrix in vitro
was assessed using the RTCA DP cell analyzer system
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The upper
chamber of CIM invasion plates were pre-coated with
MatrigelTM (5% in SFM). Cells were stimulated with 3nM
CXCL8 as required and invasion towards media alone or
media containing 100ng/ml CXCL12 was investigated.
Measurements were taken every 15min for 36h.
