ABSTRACT
Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) produced by Campylobacter jejuni is a genotoxin
that induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in mammalian cells. Recent studies have
demonstrated that prostate cancer (PCa) cells can acquire radio-resistance when
DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein (DAB2IP) is downregulated. In this study, we showed
that CDT could induce cell death in DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells. A combination of
CDT and radiotherapy significantly elicited cell death in DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells
by inhibiting the repair of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand break
(DSB) during G2/M arrest, which is triggered by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)dependent DNA damage checkpoint responses. We also found that CDT administration
significantly increased the efficacy of radiotherapy in a xenograft mouse model. These
results indicate that CDT can be a potent therapeutic agent for radio-resistant PCa.

INTRODUCTION

B (Akt) [7]. Loss of DAB2IP expression in PCa cells
has been reported to provide a survival advantage and
resistance to stress-induced apoptosis [8]. Reduced
expression of DAB2IP in PCa cells also induces epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to cancer
metastasis [9], and these cells acquire radio-resistance to
ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis [10]. Therefore,
it is imperative to develop a strategy to overcome radioresistant phenotype of these cells in order to maximize the
efficacy of radiation therapy.
Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a bacterial
genotoxin [11]. It is a tripartite protein toxin composed
of the 3 subunits, CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC [12], that are
encoded by an operon comprising cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC
[13]. In a holotoxin containing all the three subunits, CdtA
and CdtC are to interact with the cell membrane and enable
the translocation of CdtB across the cell membrane [14].

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent
male cancers in many western developed countries, and
its incidence is increasing worldwide [1]. For patients
with inoperable disease or high risk of cancer recurrence,
radiation therapy is considered an optimal choice [2,3].
However, some of these patients present with intrinsic
radio-resistance or develop radio-resistance prior to
or after radiotherapy [4]. Although recent advances in
radiotherapy have improved the disease-free survival rates
of patients with disseminated PCa, disease recurrence
remains inevitable [5,6].
DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein (DAB2IP) is
a potent tumor suppressor in PCa, modulating several
pathways including that of mitogen-activated protein
kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase

Cellular cholesterol plays an important role in mediating
CDT binding to the cell membrane, where it serves as
a portal for CdtB delivery into host cells and induction
of cell intoxication [15-18]. In addition, the nucleartranslocated CdtB exhibits type I deoxyribonuclease
activity, which causes DNA damage leading to cell-cycle
arrest at G2/M [11]. Several studies have shown some
promising therapeutic effect of CDT, derived from other
bacterial species, on oral cancer cells [19-21]. Thus, we
decided to explore the effect of CDT on radio-resistant
PCa cells. Data from this study indeed reveal that CDT can
overcome radio-resistance of PCa cells by intervening the
repair of the radiation-induced DNA double-strand break
(DSB) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent
DNA damage checkpoint responses. Taken together, CDT
in combination with radiotherapy can be considered a
unique therapeutic strategy to aggressive PCa.

distention was apparent in shDAB2IP cells treated with
CDT (Supplementary Figure S2). Similarly, a significant
cytotoxic effect of CDT treatment was observed in
DAB2IP-deficient cells (Figure 1C), whereas this was not
observed in control cells.

CDT increases the sensitivity of DAB2IP-deficient
PCa cells to IR
We then assessed whether CDT enhances the
sensitivity of PCa cells to IR. Cells were first treated
with CDT alone (0–10 nM), and viability was determined
using clonogenic assay. We found that shDAB2IP cells
were more susceptible to CDT than shVector cells, and
the effect of CDT was dose-dependent (Figure 2A). In
addition, our data also demonstrated that shDAB2IP
cells were more susceptible to combined treatment than
IR alone (Figure 2B). The surviving fraction (SF) in
response to IR at 2 Gy (SF2) for shVector and shDAB2IP
cells was 0.75 and 0.87, respectively. Notably, when cells
were treated with a combination of CDT and IR, the SF2
significantly decreased to 0.68 for shVector cells and
0.66 for shDAB2IP cells. The dose enhancement ratio

RESULTS
CDT induces cell death in DAB2IP- knockdown
(KD) cells
Our recent data demonstrated that loss of DAB2IP
in PCa cells elicited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), leading to cancer metastases [8] and radioresistance [9]. Considering the therapeutic potential of
CDT, we aimed to evaluate whether CDT holotoxin
exhibits any cytolethal activity in PCa cells. Three cell
lines, LAPC4, PC-3, and PZ-HPV-7, were included in
this study. Western blot analysis showed that DAB2IP
levels were significantly reduced in all three DAB2IP-KD
(i.e., shDAB2IP) lines compared to their corresponding
controls (i.e., shVector) (Supplementary Figure S1).
LAPC4 shVector and shDAB2IP cells were treated
with different concentrations (0–1000 nM) of CDT for
varying incubation times (0–96 h), and CDT cytotoxicity
was determined. As shown in Figure 1A and B, CDT
potently induced cell death in LAPC4 shDAB2IP cells in
a concentration- and time-dependent manner with an IC50
of approximately 200 nM (Figure 1A). To further evaluate
whether CDT exhibited cytolethal activity in these cells,
we treated cells with CDT at 200 nM for 24 h. Cell

CDT with radiation results in synergistic antitumor activity in DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells

A recent study has suggested that c-Myc expression
is required to activate ATM-dependent DNA damage
checkpoint responses when cells are exposed to IR or CDT
[23]. We therefore tested whether c-Myc plays a critical
role in the CDT-enhanced radio-sensitivity of DAB2IPdeficient PCa cells. As shown in Figure 5A, c-Myc

CDT acts by eliciting cell cycle arrest at G2/M,
subsequently inducing apoptosis [22]. To evaluate the
effect of CDT on cell cycle arrest in shDAB2IP cells with
or without IR, LAPC4 shDAB2IP cells were treated with
CDT alone, IR alone, and CDT combined with IR. Cells
were then harvested at various time points (0.5–24 h) after
treatment and subjected to cell cycle analysis. Our data
showed that when treated with CDT alone, the number of
LAPC4 shDAB2IP cells arrested in G2/M phase gradually
increased from 0.5 to 24 h (Figure 3A). IR alone also
induced a time-dependent G2/M arrest during 0.5–8 h
of incubation time, but such an effect was attenuated at
24 h. In contrast, a combination treatment with CDT and
IR led to a significant synergistic G2/M cell cycle arrest
observed at 24 h. These results suggest that CDT-induced
cell death in radio-resistant PCa cells may be mediated
through G2/M cell cycle arrest.
We further investigated whether CDT induces cell
death in LAPC4 shDAB2IP and PC-3 shDAB2IP cells.
After treatment with CDT or IR, cells were incubated
for 48 h, and cell cycle analysis was performed by flow
cytometry. As shown in Figure 4A, the proportion of
sub-G1 cells treated with IR alone was similar to that in
the untreated group. CDT treatment, however, significantly
increased the proportion of sub-G1 cells. In addition, a
combination of CDT and IR synergistically increased

was added to shVector or shDAB2IP cells before IR. (B) shVector
or shDAB2IP cells were treated with IR (2–6 Gy) alone, or CDT

expression was highly elevated in LAPC4 shDAB2IP
cells compared to controls. Although c-Myc expression
levels remained unchanged in cells treated with IR alone
compared to untreated cells (Figure 5B), they significantly
decreased when cells were treated with CDT or a
combination of CDT and IR. To further demonstrate the
role of c-Myc, shVector cells were transiently transfected
with c-Myc expression vector followed by treatment with
CDT for 24 h. An increase in CDT-induced cell death
was observed in c-Myc overexpression cells compared to
mock-transfected cells (Supplementary Figure S3). These
results suggest that c-Myc levels are critical for CDTinduced cell death. We subsequently profiled the status
of other key molecules associated with DNA DSB, and
the results indicate that the expression of phosphorylated
γ-H2AX and ATM increased in cells treated with either
CDT or a combination of CDT with IR, consistent with
increased levels of phosphorylated CHK2 and p53 (Figure
5B and 5C).

CdtB is known to exhibit endonuclease activity to
elicit DNA damage signaling (i.e., γ-H2AX expression) in
response to G2/M cell cycle arrest [24]. The recruitment
of both phospho-γ-H2AX and 53BP1 at the damage
sites often indicates an early step in response to DSB.
We therefore examined CDT-induced cell death in PCa
cells by analyzing focus formation of phospho-γ-H2AX
and 53BP1 [10]. LAPC4 cells (shVector or shDAB2IP)
were treated with CDT (50 nM) for varying amounts of
time and subjected to immunofluorescence staining for
phospho-γ-H2AX (green) and 53BP1 (red) foci. As shown
in Figure 6, the co-localization of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci
significantly increased in shVector and shDAB2IP cells
upon exposure to IR for 0.5 h compared to untreated cells
(0 h). However, the remaining foci were almost abolished
in shDAB2IP cells treated with IR at 48 h. Nevertheless, in
cells treated with a combination of CDT and IR, the high
level of foci formation remained observable in shDAB2IP

shDAB2IP cells were untreated (control), exposed to CDT (10
nM) alone, IR (1 Gy) alone, or CDT for 1 h prior to IR treatment
(CDT+IR). Cells were then collected at various time points as
indicated. Cell cycle distribution was based on DNA content

positive cells were not observed in samples from the

Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses revealed
that the cell proliferation marker (Ki-67) was diminished
and the apoptotic marker (p-PARP) increased in tumors
treated with a combination of CDT and IR (Figure 7C),
indicating that CDT increased IR-induced cell death via
apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this pre-clinical
study indicate that CDT could be a potent therapeutic
agent for PCa and can be provided in combination with
radiotherapy.

Effect of CDT, IR, and a combination of CDT and
IR on PCa growth
To further demonstrate the role of CDT as a radiosensitizer in radiotherapy for PCa, we evaluated preclinical experimental therapy using a xenograft animal
model. Tumors were treated with CDT (2.5 mg/kg).
For combination therapy, CDT was administered 6 h
before radiation. Fractionated radiation (4 Gy × 3) was
administered on days 0, 4, and 8. Our results showed
that CDT alone was able to significantly reduce tumor
growth. Nevertheless, combination therapy showed the
best efficacy compared to controls (P < 0.01), IR alone
(P < 0.01), and CDT alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 7). Our data
demonstrate that CDT can effectively inhibit the growth of
radio-resistant PCa tumors in vivo.
In comparison to controls, tumors treated with a

DISCUSSION
Bacterial toxins have been extensively studied
for their biomedical applications in cancer therapy. For
example, Shiga toxin, produced by Shigella dysenteriae
and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, has been found
to inhibit tumor growth in mouse xenograft models [25].
Diphtheria toxin inhibits protein synthesis, resulting
in cancer cell apoptosis [26]. In addition, Clostridium

perfringens enterotoxin displays acute cytotoxic activity
and induces tumor necrosis in vivo [27]. These findings
have strongly supported the use of bacterial toxins as
potential cancer therapeutic agents.
DAB2IP is a novel member of the Ras-GTPaseactivating protein family that plays an important role
in regulating cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis
by inactivating PI3K-Akt via apoptosis signalregulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activation pathways [8,9].
Downregulation of DAB2IP in PCa cells renders these
cells resistant to stress-induced apoptosis [8], radiotherapy
[10], and chemotherapy [28]. Loss of DAB2IP expression
is frequently detected in PCa cells and is associated
with an increased risk for tumor metastasis [9,29].
Furthermore, a single-nucleotide polymorphism probe
(rs1571801) in the DAB2IP gene has been nominally
associated with aggressive PCa phenotypes [30-33]. In
addition, the DAB2IP expression level determined by
immunohistochemical staining of needle biopsy specimens
from PCa patients has been shown to be associated with
recurrence-free survival in a retrospective cohort analysis
[34]. These findings suggest that DAB2IP is a prognostic
marker for aggressive PCa.
We have previously shown that loss of DAB2IP can
increase EMT in PCa, leading to cancer metastases [9] and
radio-resistance [10]. A decrease in DAB2IP expression
in PCa cells has been reported to induce accelerated
DSB repair, a G2/M checkpoint response and a means
of escaping apoptosis [10]. On the basis of the abovementioned clinical evidence and DAB2IP mechanism
of action, a targeted therapeutic strategy for DAB2IPdeficient PCa could potentially be developed. In this study,
we found that CDT, a bacterial genotoxin secreted by C.
jejuni, can induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M and apoptosis
in DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells exhibiting a radio-resistant
phenotype. Such findings suggest that CDT can sensitize
these cells to IR. Our data clearly demonstrate that CDT,
when combined with IR, has a synergistic cytotoxic effect.
The mechanisms underlying radio-sensitization induced
by CDT in DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells are attributed to
the degradation of host cell DNA and cell cycle arrest,
resulting in an increased induction of apoptosis.
Both IR and CDT have been reported to exhibit
similar cytotoxic effects: cell cycle arrest and increased
induction of apoptosis [14,35]. Our results show that
CDT dramatically induced cell death in shDAB2IP cells
but not in shVector cells (Figures 1 and 2). When treated
with a combination of CDT and IR, shDAB2IP cells
demonstrated a different cell cycle pattern from that when
treated with IR alone at 24 h. We noticed a prolonged
G2/M arrest followed by apoptosis in cells treated with a
combination of CDT and IR (Figures 3 and 4). In contrast,
a significant sub-G1 population was not observed in
shDAB2IP cells treated with IR alone (Figure 4). This
result indicates that CDT enhancement of IR-induced cell
death was mediated through cell cycle arrest followed by

activation of the apoptotic pathway.
Activation of checkpoint responses to genotoxic
stress is a major factor in the prevention of carcinogenesis
[36]. Cells exposed to DNA damaging agents often
undergo cell cycle arrest followed by senescence or
eventually apoptosis [37]. c-Myc has been reported to
play an important role in regulating cancer cell growth,
differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism [38]. In this
study, an increase in c-Myc expression was observed
in shDAB2IP cells compared to shVector cells (Figure
5A). After shDAB2IP cells were exposed to CDT or a
combination of CDT and IR, their c-Myc expression
declined, but the expressions of phosphoproteins such
as γ-H2AX, ATM, CHK2, and p53 were significantly
elevated (Figures 5B and C). These results are consistent
with a previous study reporting that c-Myc can enhance
the DNA damage response by stimulating ATM and CHK2
phosphorylation, resulting in cell death [23]. Although our
data clearly indicate that CDT can target c-Myc, which is
critical for PCa growth and survival, the exact mechanism
requires further study.
Although γ-H2AX can recruit DNA repair proteins
nearby DNA damage site and the γ-H2AX-foci containing
p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) [39], γ-H2AX is not always
associated with DNA damage. Previous studies have
demonstrated that γ-H2AX expression may be elevated
in senescent cells, thus leading to activation of the DNA
damage response (DDR) in the absence of DNA damage
[40,41]. Additionally, the pseudo-DDR, or the DDR in
senescent cells, is represented by γ-H2AX phosphorylation
without detectable DNA damage [42]. To strengthen our
finding that CDT-induced cell death was mediated by DNA
DSB, we performed additional studies involving comet
assays. As shown in Supplementary Figure S5, the comets
were significantly increased in all 3 shDAB2IP cell lines
(LAPC4, PC-3, and PZ-HPV-7) following treatment with
CDT relative to the comets in untreated cells. In contrast,
CDT only slightly increased the comets in the shVector
cells. These results are consistent with the phosphorylated
γ-H2AX expression data (Figures 5 and 6), indicating that
CDT-induced cell death in DAB2IP-deficient prostate
cancer cells was mediated by DSB.
Alteration of ATM expression has been reported
to play an important role in prostate tumorigenesis [43].
Moreover, a DNA DSB in eukaryotic cells is generally
accompanied by the formation of hundreds of histone
γ-H2AX molecules in the chromatin flanking the
break site [44]. Our data show that either CDT or CDT
combined with IR induced ATM-dependent checkpoint
responses (Figure 5). However, when the combination
treatment was applied, the ATM–CHK2–p53 apoptotic
pathway was dramatically activated, which is thought to
be a p53-dependent apoptosis response to genotoxic stress
[45]. These findings indicate that CDT-enhanced radiosensitivity in DAB2IP-deficient cells is associated with
compromised DSB repair.

Previous studies have indicated that several anticancer compounds, including honokiol [46], paclitaxel
(Taxol) [47], gemcitabine [48], and epothilone B [49],
can enhance the sensitivity of tumors to radiotherapy.
However, significant side effects associated with these
anti-cancer drugs are also frequently reported [5052]. Previous investigations have utilized CDT from
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans for the treatment
of human gingival squamous carcinoma and oral cancer
cells [19-21]. Recently, our group developed chitosan/
heparin nanoparticles for the delivery of C. jejuni CdtB
as a potential therapeutic agent for gastric cancer [53].
Our in vivo xenograft experiments in this study further
demonstrated that C. jejuni CDT effectively inhibited the
growth of radio-resistant PCa (Figure 7). Considering the
biological safety and low CDT concentration administered
in cancer therapy, our study supports the utilization of
CDT in therapy for radio-resistant PCa, particularly in
cases with loss of DAB2IP expression.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that CDT can
enhance the effect of IR in radio-resistant PCa. The
molecular mechanism of such radio-sensitization might be
attributable to the attenuation of DSB repair and the longterm cell cycle arrest at G2/M followed by the induction
of the apoptotic pathway. We believe CDT can be utilized
as a potential personalized medicine in combination with
radiotherapy to target PCa with DAB2IP deficiency.

cloned by following the standard protocols as described
previously [17]. The expressed His-tagged CdtA, CdtB,

by SDS-PAGE. Each purified protein was subjected to
ToxinEraser (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) for removing of
endotoxin.

Antibodies and reagents

The
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine
the effects of CDT on the growth of PCa cells [54]. Briefly,
PCa cells were treated with various concentrations of CDT
and different periods. Relative cell number was quantified
by a spectrophotometer (BioRad, Hercules, CA) at the
wavelength of 570nm.

Antibody specific for phospho-p53 was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Poly
(ADP-Ribose) P polymerase (PARP) antibody was
purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA). Antibodies
against cleaved PARP (Asp214), phospho-ATM and
phospho-checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) were purchased
from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Anti-phospho-γH2AX (Ser139) antibody was purchased from Millipore
(Billerica, MA). Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat antimouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated goat antirabbit IgG, and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). All other reagents were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Clonogenic survival assay
The surviving fraction (SF) of each treatment
in cells was assessed using our previous report with a
slight modification [10]. Briefly, cells were plated for 3
h to allow cell attachment followed by increasing doses
of IR alone (2–6 Gy), CDT alone (1–10 nM), or CDT
combined with IR. After 10-day incubation, the colonies
were fixed and stained with 4% formaldehyde in PBS
containing 0.05% crystal violet. The number of surviving
colonies (defined as a colony with > 50 cells) was counted
as (mean colony counts) / (cells inoculated) / (plating

was fitted to the experimental data using a least squares
fitting algorithm. Linear Quadratic (LQ) analysis was
subjected for radiation surviving curve and calculated with
the program Sigma Plot 11.0 (Systat Software, San Jose,
CA). The determination of dose enhancement ratio (DER)
was performed as described previously [49]. The radiation
DER was calculated as the dose (Gy) for radiation alone
divided by the dose for radiation combined with CDT
(normalized for CDT toxicity).

analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Göttingen, Germany) with a 63× objective (oil immersion,
aperture 1.3). Fifty nuclei from each experiment were
counted and evaluated. All samples were examined in
three independent experiments.

Animal study
Male BALB/c nude mice (BALB/cAnN.Cg-Foxnlnu/
CrlNarl, 5-weeks old; National Laboratory Animal
Center) were used in this study. A suspension of LAPC4
shDAB2IP (3 × 106) cells mixed with 50% Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in 0.1 ml was injected
subcutaneously into the right posterior ﬂanks of the
mice. Animals were divided into four groups (9 animals/
group), including untreated control, CDT alone (2.5 mg/
kg), radiation alone and combined treatment of CDT and
irradiation. CDT was administered intratumorly 6 h before
radiation in the combination treatment group. Tumors were
treated with a total dose of 12 Gy delivered in 3 fractions
using the Faxitron RX-650 irradiator (Faxitron X-ray,
Wheeling, IL) on day 0, 4 and 8. Tumors were measured
3 times per week using a Vernier caliper. Results were
evaluated with the formula: volume = 0.5236 × length ×
width × height [55].

Cell cycle analysis
LAPC4 cells were treated with CDT (50 nM), IR (2
Gy), or CDT combined with IR. Cells were then incubated
at 37°C for 0.5, 2, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h. The treated cells
were harvested and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1
h, and stained with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (SigmaAldrich) containing 1 mg/ml RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) for
1 h. The stained cells were determined by an FACScalibur
flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and the
data were analyzed using Cell Quest software WinMDI
(Verity Software House, Topsham, Me).

Western blot assay
Cells treated with CDT, IR, or CDT combined
with IR for 24 h were harvested and cell lysate was
prepared. The samples were then resolved by 6-12%
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with
primary antibodies as indicated and then incubated with
horseradish peroxidase−conjugated secondary antibody
(Millipore). The proteins of interest were detected using
the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and visualized using X-ray
film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The signal intensity of each
protein was quantified with the Image J software (National
Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis
Tissue specimens from mice were formalin-fixed
then subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) or IHC
staining. Briefly, the tissue sections were de-waxed
and rehydrated. After blocking with 3% BSA, rabbit
monoclonal antibodies against cleaved PARP (Cell
Signaling) and Ki-67 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
added to the tissue sections for 24 h at 4°C. After washing,
the samples were probed with peroxidase-labeled goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Epitomics, Burlinggame,
CA) and detected with an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA).
DNA fragmentation was detected by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-meditated dUTP-fluorescein
nick end-labeling (TUNEL) with the fragmented DNA
detection kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA) by following
the manufacture’s instruction. The prepared tissues
were treated with permeabilization reagent (0.1% Triton
X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) on ice for 2 min followed
by incubation with the TUNEL reaction mixture at 37
°C for 60 min. The stained tissues were analyzed under
a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen,
Germany).

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were seeded on 13-mm
glass coverslip in 6-well plates. After treatment, cells were
washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (SigmaAldrich) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for
30 min at room temperature. The samples were blocked
with 1% BSA for 1h and incubated with phospho-histoneγ-H2AX antibody (Ser139) (Millipore) and p53-binding
protein 1 (53BP1) antibody (Santa Cruz). Samples were
washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS, and then incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody
and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody
(Invitrogen) for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI (0.2 μg/ml) for 10 min. The stained cells were then

Three cell lines (LAPC4, PC-3, and PZ-HPV-7)
transfected with either shVector or shDAB2IP were
left untreated or treated with 200 nM CDT for 24 h.
The cells were then collected and prepared using the
Comet Assay Kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
The nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (SigmaAldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA). The comets
were imaged via fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss,
Göttingen, Germany). The tail moments (tail DNA% × tail
length) were quantified from 50 randomly selected cells.
