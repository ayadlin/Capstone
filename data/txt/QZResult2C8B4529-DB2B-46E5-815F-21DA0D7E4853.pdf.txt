ABSTRACT
The goal of this study was to determine whether combined targeted therapies,
specifically those against the Notch, hedgehog and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways,
could overcome ovarian cancer chemoresistance. Chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells
were exposed to gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI-I, Compound E) or the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib, alone and in combination with the hedgehog antagonist,
LDE225. Bortezomib, alone and in combination with LDE225, was evaluated for
effects on paclitaxel efficacy. Cell viability and cell cycle analysis were assessed by
MTT assay and propidium iodide staining, respectively. Proteasome activity and gene
expression were determined by luminescence assay and qPCR, respectively. Studies
demonstrated that GSI-I, but not Compound E, inhibited proteasome activity, similar
to bortezomib. Proteasome inhibition decreased hedgehog target genes (PTCH1,
GLI1 and GLI2) and increased LDE225 sensitivity in vitro. Bortezomib, alone and
in combination with LDE225, increased paclitaxel sensitivity through apoptosis
and G2/M arrest. Expression of the multi-drug resistance gene ABCB1/MDR1 was
decreased and acetylation of α-tubulin, a marker of microtubule stabilization, was
increased following bortezomib treatment. HDAC6 inhibitor tubastatin-a demonstrated
that microtubule effects are associated with hedgehog inhibition and sensitization
to paclitaxel and LDE225. These results suggest that proteasome inhibition, through
alteration of microtubule dynamics and hedgehog signaling, can reverse taxanemediated chemoresistance.

INTRODUCTION

improvements in progression-free survival, but no increase
in durable cures. This clinical course suggests that multiple
cellular pathways contribute to either inherent or acquired
resistance to chemotherapy. Targeting these cellular
pathways with combination therapies may provide better
long-term outcomes if the chemoresistant population can
be identified and targeted.
Cellular pathways normally involved in embryonic
development, including Notch and hedgehog, have
been found to be aberrantly expressed in a variety of

among the most chemosensitive malignancies at the time
of initial treatment (consisting of surgery and platinum/
taxane-based chemotherapy), most patients will develop

malignancies [2-4], including ovarian cancer [5-11], and
may be especially important in conferring resistance
to chemotherapies [12-16]. Thus, inhibition of these
pathways may offer valuable therapeutic strategies against
ovarian cancer, either alone or as chemosensitizing agents.
In particular, compounds that target gamma-secretase,
which is crucial for Notch signaling activation [17], have
been evaluated as potential anti-cancer agents. In addition,
compounds have been developed that antagonize the
Smoothened receptor, a mediator of hedgehog signaling
[18]. One of these compounds, LDE225, has been used to
target cancer cells in both pre-clinical and clinical models
[18-21].
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is responsible
for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the
degradation of proteins. Disruption of this pathway can
result in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as a result of
incompatible regulatory protein accumulation within the
cell [22]. Cancer cells generally have higher levels of
proteasome activity and are more sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than normal
cells, making the proteasome a desirable therapeutic
target [23]. Bortezomib is a dipeptidyl boronic acidbased reversible proteasome inhibitor that targets the
chymotrypsin- and caspase-like active sites of the
proteasome complex [24]. This compound was the first
proteasome inhibitor to be approved for clinical use
and is commonly used in the treatment of hematologic
malignancies, including multiple myeloma and mantle
cell lymphoma [25]. By inhibiting the proteasome,
bortezomib acts through several mechanisms to suppress
tumor survival pathways and to arrest tumor growth,
metastasis and angiogenesis. These mechanisms of action
have provided rationale for the combination of bortezomib
with numerous chemotherapeutic and targeted agents [2628], some of which have been evaluated in ovarian cancer
clinical trials [29-31].
Novel therapeutic strategies targeting chemoresistant
cells are essential to achieving durable cures in ovarian
cancer. In our study, we sought to reverse resistance to
chemotherapeutic and targeted agents using different
pharmacological strategies. The results of this study
demonstrate several novel mechanisms. First, the variable
response seen with different gamma-secretase inhibitors
is due to differential effects on the proteasome. Secondly,
proteasome inhibition affects microtubule stabilization in
a manner similar to taxanes and increases sensitivity to
paclitaxel. Finally, proteasome inhibition alone reduces
hedgehog pathway signaling and as a result is synergistic
with hedgehog antagonist LDE225. The demonstrated
crossover between these pathways sheds new light onto
the contributing mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance
in ovarian cancer and provides new opportunities for
clinical development.

In vitro resistance to the Smoothened antagonist,
LDE225, can be reversed by the gamma-secretase
inhibitor GSI-I but not compound E
We first sought to examine the mechanisms of dual
inhibition of the Notch and Hedgehog pathways in three
chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell lines: A2780cp55
(platinum- and taxane-resistant), HeyA8MDR (taxaneresistant) and SKOV3TRip2 (taxane-resistant). Dosedependent growth inhibition with LDE225 alone is
shown in Figure 1A. The decrease in A2780cp55 and
HeyA8MDR cell viability following LDE225 treatment
is similar (39.7% versus 38.2% decrease at 5 µM and
56.7% versus 60.1% decrease at 10 µM). However,
SKOV3TRip2 cells responded to LDE225 to a lesser
extent by comparison (13.5% and 35.4% decrease at 5
and 10 µM, respectively), suggesting that these cells have
an innate mechanism of resistance to LDE225. Therefore,
further combination strategies were pursued in this line
in an attempt to uncover mechanisms of resistance to
hedgehog inhibition.
Having previously demonstrated crosstalk between
the Notch and Hedgehog pathways in SKOV3TRip2
cells [32], we wanted to determine if targeting the Notch
pathway using gamma-secretase inhibitors could have an
effect on response to LDE225 in these cells. To this end,
we examined the effect of 2 different gamma-secretase
inhibitors, GSI-I and GSI-XXI (Compound E) on the
viability of SKOV3TRip2 cells. Interestingly, the viability
of these cells was decreased following exposure to GSI-I,
but not to Compound E (Figure 1B). Used in combination,
GSI-I increased the sensitivity of SKOV3TRip2 cells to
LDE225; up to a 17-fold decrease in the LDE225 IC50
compared to DMSO control was observed, suggesting
a synergistic interaction (Figure 1C). Calculation of a
combination index (CI=0.44 at 2µM, CI=0.11 at 3µM)
confirms a synergistic effect. This effect was not observed
with LDE225 in combination with Compound E (Figure
1D), suggesting that these gamma-secretase inhibitors may
have differential mechanisms of action.
To determine if Notch inhibition is playing a role
in LDE225 sensitization, knockdown of Notch signaling
components (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Jagged1) was
carried out using siRNA. These siRNAs have previously
been shown by our laboratory to decrease the mRNA
levels of their respective target genes by up to 85% [32].
Alone, knockdown of these individual genes decreased
SKOV3TRip2 cell viability (by 65.1%, 29.3%, 45.7%
and 73.3%, respectively; p<0.05) compared to siRNA
control, indicating that Notch signaling does contribute
to the survival of these cells (Figure 1E). However, none
of these siRNAs had a significant sensitizing effect on
7066

LDE225, as demonstrated by parallel dose response curves
(Figure 1E) compared to the siRNA control. The fact that
independent Notch family targeting and Compound E
could not sensitize to hedgehog inhibition, as GSI-I could,
suggest that the mechanism by which GSI-I sensitizes
SKOV3TRip2 cells to LDE225 is independent of Notch
inhibition.

GSI-I sensitizes SKOV3TRip2 cells to LDE225 through
this mechanism rather than gamma-secretase inhibition,
we first examined the effects of GSI-I, Compound E
and bortezomib (a known proteasome inhibitor) on
proteasome activity. In agreement with previous studies,
both GSI-I and bortezomib produced a dose-dependent
decrease in proteasome activity by up to 51.6% and
71.0%, respectively (p<0.05), whereas Compound E
did not (Figure 2A). Moreover, treatment with GSI-I
or bortezomib resulted in a significant increase in
polyubiquitinated proteins, an indicator of proteasome
inhibition [33] (Figure 2B). When combined with
LDE225, bortezomib produced a similar synergistic effect
on the viability of SKOV3TRip2 cells as that observed

with GSI-I. Up to a 10-fold decrease in the LDE225 IC50
compared to DMSO control (CI=0.64 at 20nM, CI=0.38
at 30nM) was observed (Figure 2C).
To determine how proteasome inhibition combined
with LDE225 might affect cell growth, we performed cell
cycle analysis on SKOV3TRip2 cells that were treated
with DMSO control, LDE225 (5 µM), GSI-I (2 µM),
Compound E (30 µM), bortezomib (20 nM), or combined
LDE225+GSI-I, combined LDE225+Compound E or
combined LDE225+bortezomib for 72 hours. As shown
in Figure 2D, LDE225+GSI-I and LDE225+bortezomib
treatment combinations resulted in a greater accumulation
of cells in the sub-G0/apoptotic (9.0% and 9.5%,
respectively, versus 2.5% control), S (23.3% and 26.1%,
respectively, versus 9.9% control) and G2/M (34.3%
and 35.2%, respectively, versus 27.2% control) phases
compared to DMSO control or either treatment alone (all
p<0.05). Combined LDE225+Compound E did not have
these effects. Representative flow cytometric graphs for
combination therapy compared to control are shown in
Figure 2E. In addition, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) cleavage, an indicator of apoptosis, was
observed in SKOV3TRip2 cells treated with combined
LDE225+GSI-I, bortezomib alone and combined
LDE225+bortezomib (Figure 2F). These data suggest
that the synergy between LDE225 combined with GSI-I
or bortezomib results from cell cycle arrest at the S and
G2/M phases, with the induction of apoptosis possibly
playing a limited role.
To further examine the mechanism by which
proteasome inhibition increases LDE225 sensitivity, we
quantified gene expression of PTCH1, GLI1 and GLI2,
established markers of hedgehog pathway activity [36]
in SKOV3TRip2 cells exposed to DMSO, LDE225 (5
µM), GSI-I (2 µM), Compound E (30 µM), bortezomib
(30 nM), LDE225+GSI-I, LDE225+Compound E or
LDE225+bortezomib after 24 hours using qPCR analysis.
As shown in Figure 2G, LDE225-resistant SKOV3TRip2
cells demonstrated no significant decrease in PTCH1,
GLI1 or GLI2 expression following exposure to single
agent LDE225 (5 µM). This result agrees with LDE225’s
lack of an effect on SKOV3TRip2 cell viability at this
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

concentration (see Figure 1A). Surprisingly, GSI-I alone,
but again not Compound E, led to a profound decrease in
expression of PTCH1 (by 41.8%, p<0.05) and GLI1 (by
50.7%, p<0.05) compared to DMSO control. Moreover,
combined GSI-I and LDE225 further decreased expression
of PTCH1, GLI1 and GLI2 (by 64.2%, 63.2% and 57.6%,
respectively; p<0.05) compared to DMSO control.
Similar to GSI-I, bortezomib alone significantly decreased
PTCH1, GLI1 and GLI2 expression in SKOV3TRip2 cells
(by up to 70.2%, 51.6% and 32.9%, respectively; p<0.05)
compared to DMSO control. Combined bortezomib and
LDE225 further decreased expression of PTCH1 and GLI1
(by 74.2% and 69.4%, respectively; p<0.05) compared
to LDE alone or DMSO control. These data establish a
previously-unrecognized direct effect of proteasome
inhibition on hedgehog signaling.

Bortezomib decreases hedgehog transcriptional
activity in ovarian cancer cell lines in a dosedependent manner
As shown in Table 1, OvCar3 and SKOV3TRip2
cells were the most sensitive and resistant, respectively,
to GSI-I and bortezomib. Linear regression analysis of
GSI-I and bortezomib response (IC50s) across all cell
lines revealed a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.78,
suggesting a similarity in drug response and mechanism
of action (i.e. proteasome inhibition). SKOV3TRip2 cells
demonstrated an increased resistance to both GSI-I and
bortezomib compared to its parental, chemosensitive
cell line, SKOV3ip1 (bortezomib viability results shown
in Figure 3A). The effect of bortezomib on hedgehog
transcriptional activity (as determined by PTCH1, GLI1,
GLI2 gene expression) in SKOV3TRip2 cells led us to
evaluate this compound in other ovarian cancer cell
lines. Interestingly, in all of the ovarian cancer cell lines
that were examined by qPCR (A2780cp20, A2780cp55,
HeyA8MDR, ES2), bortezomib significantly (p<0.05)
decreased hedgehog transcriptional activity in a dosedependent manner within 24 hours (Figure 3B-E).
These results agree with the reductions in PTCH1, GLI1

primary mediator of taxane resistance ABCB1/MDR1.
This gene encodes for P-glycoprotein, a drug efflux
pump that has been shown by our laboratory to play a
role in the synergy between LDE225 and paclitaxel [16].
Gene expression of ABCB1/MDR1 was measured using
qPCR after treatment with increasing concentrations
of bortezomib for 72 hours. As shown in Figure 5A,
bortezomib (10, 20, 30 nM) significantly (p<0.05)
decreased ABCB1/MDR1 expression in a dose-dependent
manner (by 25%, 73% and 83%, respectively), indicating
that bortezomib increases paclitaxel sensitivity, at least in
part, through inhibition of drug efflux.
To more directly examine the effect of bortezomib
on hedgehog signaling and chemotherapy response, we
next evaluated the effect of bortezomib on microtubule
stabilization. Recent studies have indicated that
microtubule dynamics may play a role in bortezomib
response [37, 38] as well as hedgehog signaling [39],
thereby providing the rationale for examining this cellular
process. A2780cp55 cells were treated with DMSO,
bortezomib (5 nM), paclitaxel (50 nM) or LDE225 (10
M) for 24 hours, and examined for protein expression of
acetylated α-tubulin, a marker of microtubule stabilization,
using Western blot analysis. Treatment with bortezomib,
and to a similar degree with paclitaxel, led to an increase
in acetylated α-tubulin (Figure 5B). Alternatively,
treatment with LDE225 did not have this effect,
suggesting that hedgehog inhibition itself does not impact
tubulin polymerization. An alternative relationship was
hypothesized, whereby hedgehog signaling may actually
be a downstream effect of microtubule stabilization.
Indeed, A2780cp55 cells treated with microtubulestabilizing agents, paclitaxel and the selective HDAC6
inhibitor, tubastatin-a [40], demonstrated modest but
significant (p<0.05) decreases in GLI1 (33% and 30%,
respectively) and GLI2 (33% and 26%, respectively)
gene expression (Figure 5C), similar to decreases noted
after treatment with bortezomib (Figure 2E, 3B-E). To
determine whether microtubule effects play a role in drug
sensitization, we exposed chemoresistant ovarian cancer
cells to DMSO or tubastatin-a, combined with increasing
concentrations of paclitaxel or LDE225. Similar to
bortezomib, we found that tubastatin-a increased
paclitaxel sensitivity in A2780cp55 cells (up to a 5-fold
decrease in IC50 compared to DMSO control; Figure 5D)
and in SKOV3TRip2 cells (up to a 3-fold decrease in IC50
compared to DMSO control; Figure 5E). Also similar to
bortezomib, tubastatin-a increased LDE225 sensitivity
in LDE225-resistant SKOV3TRip2 cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5F). Taken together, these data
suggest bortezomib can reverse taxane chemoresistance by
interfering with microtubule dynamics and, subsequently,
hedgehog pathway activity.

inhibitory effect of bortezomib on hedgehog signaling
led us to consider whether this compound could be used
to increase paclitaxel sensitivity. The chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cell lines A2780cp55 and SKOV3TRip2
were exposed to DMSO or bortezomib combined with
increasing concentrations of paclitaxel. Interestingly,
we found that bortezomib combined with paclitaxel act
in a synergistic manner. Up to a 2.3-fold decrease in
paclitaxel IC50 compared to DMSO control was observed
in A2780cp55 cells (CI=0.47) (Figure 4A) and up to a
2.6-fold decrease in paclitaxel IC50 compared to DMSO
control was observed in SKOV3TRip2 cells (CI=0.41
at 30nM) (Figure 4B). To determine whether LDE225
combined with bortezomib could have a greater effect
on paclitaxel sensitization, we exposed A2780cp55 and
SKOV3TRip2 cells to DMSO, LDE225, bortezomib
or LDE225+bortezomib combined with increasing
concentrations of paclitaxel. In agreement with previous
findings [16], LDE225 alone increased the sensitivity of
A2780cp55 and SKOV3TRip2 cells to paclitaxel (Figure
4C, D); however, combined LDE225+bortezomib did not
further enhance paclitaxel sensitization compared to single
agents, indicating an additive effect. These results suggest
that bortezomib can sensitize chemoresistant ovarian
cancer cells to a similar degree as inhibition of hedgehog
signaling.
To determine the mechanism through which
bortezomib combined with paclitaxel might affect cell
growth in a synergistic manner, we performed cell cycle
analysis on A2780cp55 and SKOV3TRip2 cells after
treatment with DMSO (vehicle control), bortezomib alone,
paclitaxel alone or combined bortezomib+paclitaxel for 72
hours. As shown in Figure 4E/F, bortezomib+paclitaxel
combination treatment resulted in a significantly greater
(p<0.05) accumulation of cells in the sub-G0/apoptotic
phase (17.9% versus 6.2%, 9.6%, 13.5% for A2780cp55;
17.1% versus 1.1%, 6.5%, 5.8% for SKOV3TRip2) and
the G2/M phase (44.9% versus 27.0%, 39.4%, 21.3%
for A2780cp55; 46.3% versus 27.8%, 34.6%, 30.3% for
SKOV3TRip2) compared to DMSO control, bortezomib
alone and paclitaxel alone, respectively. In addition, PARP
cleavage was more readily observed in SKOV3TRip2
cells treated with combined bortezomib+paclitaxel
compared to DMSO control and single agents (Figure
4G). Taken together, these data suggest that bortezomib,
in combination with paclitaxel, induces apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest at the G2/M phase.

Modification of microtubule dynamics plays a role
in the sensitization of paclitaxel and LDE225 by
bortezomib

by bortezomib could promote increased paclitaxel
sensitivity in vitro, we first examined expression of a

DISCUSSION

cell cycle arrest (S and G2/M phases) and apoptosis in
combination with LDE225, compared to DMSO control
or single agents. It was demonstrated from the qPCR
analysis of cells treated with GSI-I or bortezomib that
there is crosstalk between the proteasome and hedgehog
signaling pathways, as the mRNA levels of hedgehog
target genes (PTCH1, GLI1 and GLI2) decrease with
exposure to either drug. It has been proposed that
hedgehog inhibitor resistance may be due to three distinct
mechanisms: 1) mutations within Smoothened that prevent
molecular interaction with the inhibitor, 2) activation of
compensatory pathways, 3) increased amplification of
downstream mediators in the hedgehog pathway, such
as the Gli transcription factors [18, 20]. If resistance to
LDE225 is occurring upstream (perhaps at the level of
Smoothened), it could be theorized that suppression of
hedgehog signaling downstream of Smoothened (through
proteasome inhibition) would help alleviate this resistance.
Based on our previous finding that hedgehog
antagonism could be used to reverse taxane resistance
[16], we asked whether proteasome inhibition, through
its effect on hedgehog, could be used to achieve the
same goal. Indeed, we found that bortezomib sensitized
chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel. This
combination effect was accompanied by decreased
expression of ABCB1/MDR1, a drug efflux pump that is
strongly associated with taxane resistance and hedgehog
pathway upregulation [14, 16]. Having found that
bortezomib was able to increase sensitivity to LDE225
and paclitaxel in vitro, we sought to identify a common
mechanism that could account for these biologic effects.
Recent studies have implicated microtubule stabilization
as one of bortezomib’s mechanisms of action [37, 38].
In addition, microtubule dynamics have been shown to
play a role in regulating hedgehog signaling [39]. These
studies led us to investigate the impact of bortezomib on
microtubule function. In agreement with microtubulestabilizing agents, bortezomib alone, and in combination
with paclitaxel, was found to induce G2/M phase arrest.
Moreover, bortezomib increased acetylation of α-tubulin, a
marker of microtubule stabilization and HDAC6 inhibition
[43], compared to DMSO control. As single agents, the
microtubule stabilizing agents, paclitaxel and the selective
HDAC6 inhibitor, tubastatin-a, decreased hedgehog gene
expression, suggesting that the changes in microtubule
dynamics following bortezomib treatment are associated
with decreases in hedgehog signaling. LDE225 did not
affect acetylated α-tubulin, indicating that hedgehog
inhibition itself is not responsible for microtubule
stabilization, but rather occurs downstream of this event.
Sensitization of chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells to
paclitaxel and LDE225 by tubastatin-a further suggests
that microtubule effects are a mechanism whereby
bortezomib can induce chemosensitivity.
Because bortezomib and paclitaxel seem to
share a common mechanism of action (i.e. microtubule

In the current study, we found that inhibiting the
proteasome, using two distinct pharmacologic agents,
decreased hedgehog pathway activity and increased
LDE225 sensitivity in an ovarian cancer model. Moreover,
proteasome inhibition sensitized chemoresistant ovarian
cancer cells to paclitaxel. These effects appear to be
mediated, at least in part, by modification of microtubule
dynamics within ovarian cancer cells. The participation of
proteasome inhibition in reversing chemotherapeutic and
targeted therapy resistance makes it an attractive clinical
strategy, considering most ovarian cancer patients develop
tumor recurrence and succumb to chemoresistant disease.
Recent studies have identified clinical resistance
to selective hedgehog antagonists, such as GDC-0449/
vismodegib and LDE225/erismodegib [18-21]; however,
strategies for reversing this resistance have not been well
defined. In a previous study, we reported that GLI1 and
GLI2 mRNA levels, indicators of hedgehog signaling,
were significantly higher in cancer cells isolated from
persistent/chemoresistant ovarian tumors compared to
those isolated from matched primary tumors [41]. In
addition, we have shown that hedgehog signaling plays
a role in ovarian cancer chemoresistance [16]. Based on
these data, the utility of developing methods for increasing
sensitivity to hedgehog antagonists becomes apparent.
Initially, we focused on crosstalk between the hedgehog
and Notch signaling pathways as a potential mechanism
of LDE225 resistance, based upon the finding that the
Notch ligand Jagged1 can regulate hedgehog signaling
[32]. Inhibition of the gamma-secretase complex, which
is essential for processing of the Notch signaling cascade,
initially provided contrasting results, as one of the
agents, GSI-I, sensitized ovarian cancer cells to LDE225,
whereas another agent, GSI-XXI/Compound E, did not.
Moreover, knockdown of individual Notch signaling
components (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Jagged1) did
not increase LDE225 sensitivity, suggesting that Notch/
hedgehog interactions are not involved in resistance to
this compound. Since GSI-I, but not Compound E, was
found to increase LDE225 sensitivity in ovarian cancer
cells, we sought to identify an alternative mechanism of
action for GSI-I that is independent of gamma-secretase
inhibition. Recent studies have indicated that GSI-I can
act as a proteasome inhibitor [33-35], largely due to
the fact that this compound is derived from MG132, a
known proteasome inhibitor [42]. Evaluation of GSI-I
on proteasome activity revealed that this compound does
significantly inhibit the proteasome in our ovarian cancer
model.
Based on this evidence, we combined the more
selective and clinically available proteasome inhibitor,
bortezomib, with LDE225 to determine if the same
sensitization would result, which we did observe in
vitro. GSI-I and bortezomib also similarly increased

stabilization), it would seem counterintuitive for these
agents to act in a synergistic manner when combined.
The same could be said of the combination effects of
tubastatin-a and paclitaxel. As suggested by Poruchynsky
et al. [37], it could be postulated that proteasome inhibition
increases the expression of proteins that help stabilize
microtubules, thereby providing a favorable environment
for paclitaxel effects. In addition, HDAC6 may play a role
in regulating these microtubule-associated proteins or
vice versa, thereby affecting microtubule dynamics in a
manner independent of the mechanism by which paclitaxel
causes microtubule stabilization, which is through direct
binding to tubulin [44]. In terms of LDE225 sensitization,
it could be additionally inferred that HDAC6 inhibition
results in decreased hedgehog signaling downstream of
Smoothened, thereby overcoming potential resistance
mechanisms that exist at the level of this receptor or
compensatory pathways.
Collectively, this study validates proteasome
inhibition as a strategy for reversing resistance to
chemotherapy and hedgehog-targeting agents in an
ovarian cancer model. With the ability to identify cancer
patients whose tumors have active hedgehog signaling,
proteasome inhibition could ultimately provide a useful
therapeutic strategy for reversing chemoresistance and
increasing overall survival in ovarian cancer patients.

lines was confirmed with STR genomic analysis, and
only cells less than 20 passages from stocks were used in
experiments.

Cell viability assays
In each well of a 96-well plate, 2,000 cells were
exposed to increasing concentrations of single agents,
in triplicate. For combination studies, cells were treated
with fixed doses of GSI-I, Compound E, bortezomib or
tubastatin-a combined with increasing concentrations of
LDE225, in triplicate. In addition, cells were exposed
to fixed doses of bortezomib, tubastatin-a, LDE225
or LDE225+bortezomib combined with increasing
concentrations of paclitaxel, in triplicate. For combination
studies, all drugs were added at the same time and cells
were allowed to grow until the control groups reached
80-90% confluency (usually 72 hours). After this time,
50 µL of 0.15% MTT dye (Sigma-Aldrich) was added
to each well and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 2
hours. Conversion of MTT to formazan, a measure of
cell viability, was determined using an Epoch Microplate
Spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). IC50 of
the drug of interest was determined by finding the dose
at which 50% inhibition of cell viability was achieved,
calculated by the equation [(OD570MAX-OD570MIN)/2) +

to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification was
performed on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection
system and gene expression was calculated using the
comparative CT method as previously described [47].
Briefly, this technique uses the formula 2-ΔΔCT to calculate
the expression of target genes normalized to a calibrator.
The cycling threshold (CT) indicates the cycle number
at which the amount of amplified target reaches a fixed
threshold. CT values range from 0 to 40 (the latter
representing the default upper limit PCR cycle number
that defines failure to detect a signal).

SKOV3Trip2 cells were plated in white-walled 96well plates (2,000 cells/well), allowed to attach overnight,
and exposed to DMSO, LDE225, GSI-I, Compound E
or bortezomib, in quadruplicate, at the indicated doses
for 24 hours. Proteasome activity was measured in these
treated cells using the Proteasome-Glo ChymotrypsinLike Cell-Based Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). One
hundred µl of Proteasome-Glo reagent was added to the
100 µl of media present in each well, mixed for 2 minutes
at 700 rpm using a plate shaker and incubated at room
temperature for 2 hours. Luminescence was measured in
each well using a Synergy HT Microplate Reader (Biotek).

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were collected in modified
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer with
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Manheim, Germany).
Lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis by
standard techniques [46] using ubiquitin antibody
(P4D1, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody (7D3-6,
BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), or acetylated α-tubulin
antibody (D20G3, Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1000
dilution overnight at 4°C or anti-β-actin antibody (AC15, Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 hour at RT,
which was used to monitor equal sample loading. After
washing, blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit (for
acetylated α-tubulin) or goat anti-mouse (for ubiquitin,
PARP, β-actin) secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Visualization
was performed by the enhanced chemiluminescence
method (Pierce Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were treated with the indicated agents for 72
hours, trypsinized, and fixed in 100% ethanol overnight
at 4°C. Cells were then centrifuged, washed in PBS, and
resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v),
200 µg/mL DNase-free RNase A and 20 µg/mL propidium
iodide (PI). Cells were incubated in the PI staining
solution for at least 30 minutes at 4°C prior to analysis.
PI fluorescence was assessed by flow cytometry and the
percentage of cells in sub-G0, G0/G1, S and G2/M phases
was calculated by the cell cycle analysis module for Flow
Cytometry Analysis Software (FlowJo v.7.6.1, Ashland,
OR).

RNA extraction and reverse transcription

Statistical analysis

Total RNA was isolated from ovarian cancer cell
lines using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA was then DNase treated and purified
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).
RNA was eluted in 50 μL of RNase-free water and stored
at -80°C. The concentration of all RNA samples was
quantified by spectrophotometric absorbance at 260/280
nm using a Take3 Micro-Volume Plate in an Epoch
Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek). Prior to cDNA
synthesis, all RNA samples were diluted to 20 ng/μL
using RNase-free water. cDNA was prepared using the
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting cDNA
samples were analyzed using quantitative PCR.

Comparisons of cell viability, gene expression,
relative luminescence units (RLU), and PI fluorescence
were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test,
if assumptions of data normality were met. Those
represented by alternate distribution were examined using
a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. In the case of
multiple group comparisons, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post-test was performed.
Differences between groups were considered statistically
significant at p<0.05. Error bars represent standard
deviation unless otherwise stated. The combination
index (CI) method [48] was used to identify synergistic
interactions between different compounds in their effect
on cancer cell viability. A CI value equal to 1 indicates an
additive effect, a CI value less than 1 indicates synergy
(greater than additive) and a CI value greater than 1
indicates antagonism.
