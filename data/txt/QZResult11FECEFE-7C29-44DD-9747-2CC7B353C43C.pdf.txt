Abstract
Erlotinib (Tarceva), is an orally available, reversible inhibitor of
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; HER1) that exhibits
inhibitory activity on purified HER2 kinase at much higher
concentrations. Despite the minimal activity on purified
protein in vitro, in vivo studies show that erlotinib inhibits
the growth of HER2-driven systems effectively. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this discrepancy. In
particular, it has been suggested that erlotinib might indirectly
suppress the activity of HER2 by blocking the ability of EGFR to
transactivate it when the two receptors are part of a
heterodimer complex. However, an alternative possibility that
has not been adequately addressed is whether the direct
inhibitory action of erlotinib on the HER2 kinase might account
for the observed biological responses. To distinguish between a
direct effect of erlotinib on HER2 kinase in intact cells or an
indirect effect of erlotinib on HER2 activity that is mediated
through EGFR, we generated cell lines that express either
EGFR-H2 chimeric receptor or HER2 and HER3 receptors in an
EGFR-negative background. We show that dose-dependent
inhibition of HER2 was achieved at the receptor level, on
downstream signaling molecules, and more importantly was
also translated into inhibition of cell growth. Our findings
imply that the inhibitory effect of erlotinib in HER2-expressing
cells may in part be mediated through direct interaction with
HER2 rather than indirectly through a process that requires the
presence of EGFR. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1228–38]

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family consists of
four members: EGFR/HER1, HER2/ErbB2, HER3/ErbB3, and HER4/
ErbB4. These receptors are essential in modulating cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival in many tissue types (1).
On ligand binding, the receptors form homodimers and heterodimers, and the subsequent activation of the intrinsic kinase
then results in receptor autophosphorylation and the activation of
downstream signaling mediators (2). Aberrant expression of EGFR
and HER2 has been implicated in the development of many types
of human cancers, including lung, head and neck, colorectal,
pancreatic, breast, and ovarian cancers, and patients with tumors
bearing dysregulated EGFR or HER2 receptors have been linked to
poor clinical outcome (3, 4). Therefore, EGFR as well as HER2 have
been intensely pursued as therapeutic targets.

Erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva) is a selective, orally available low
molecular weight inhibitor that binds competitively to the ATPbinding site at the kinase domain of EGFR. The IC50 measured in
in vitro kinase assays is 2 nmol/L, whereas the potency in intact
cells is f20 nmol/L (5). Preclinical studies with erlotinib have
shown potent antitumor activity in a variety of cultured tumor cell
lines as well as human tumor xenografts (6, 7), and favorable
clinical studies have led to the approval of erlotinib for the use in
the treatment of advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer (8).
Identifying predictors of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors has been a focus of recent research, and a variety of
efforts are ongoing to elucidate what confers sensitivity to these
inhibitors. In contrast to the HER2 therapeutic antibody trastuzumab that is effective only on HER2-amplified tumors, the role of
EGFR expression as a predictor for clinical outcome is less defined
(9–11). Consequently, further studies were designed to determine if
EGFR gene amplification rather than EGFR overexpression as
assessed by immunohistochemistry is a better indicator to identify
patients who might benefit from EGFR-directed therapies (12). The
recently identified EGFR kinase mutations have proven to be very
sensitive to erlotinib (13–15). Yet, tumors with mutated EGFR are
not the only tumors that respond to kinase inhibitors (16–18),
suggesting that factors other than EGFR mutations contribute to
the sensitivity.
The presence or absence of other members of the EGFR family
alters the responsiveness of tumor cells to EGFR kinase inhibitors
(19) because these receptors modify the signaling properties of
EGFR (20). In fact, HER2 is known to form heterodimers with
EGFR, and several studies have recently reported that epithelial
tumor cell lines and human tumor xenograft models overexpressing HER2 are particularly sensitive to erlotinib and to
another EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib (21–23).
Additionally, a recent clinical study suggests that EGFR-positive
NSCLC patients with increased HER2 gene copy numbers
respond better to gefitinib than patients that do not overexpress
HER2 (24).
Why HER2-overexpressing cells are particularly sensitive to an
EGFR inhibitor is still unclear. In vitro kinase assays suggest
that erlotinib is not effective in inhibiting HER2 kinase directly
because the sensitivity of this kinase is 40- to 3,000-fold less when
compared with the EGFR kinase (25–27). However, HER2
phosphorylation decreases significantly upon inhibitor treatment
(22, 28). Therefore, we wanted to explore whether erlotinib had
the capability to directly block HER2 kinase function in intact
cells.
HER2 activation arises through either a ligand-dependent or a
ligand-independent process. Ligand-independent activation occurs
when receptor expression levels are very high, leading to
spontaneous receptor homodimerization and kinase activation.

Erlotinib Inhibits the HER2 Kinase Directly

In contrast, ligand-dependent HER2 kinase activation requires the
formation of a heterodimeric complex between HER2 and another
member of the HER receptor family. In this case, the ligandoccupied partner transactivates HER2.
In the present study, we explored the inhibitory effects of
erlotinib on both modes of HER2 activation. We present evidence
that erlotinib directly inhibits the HER2 kinase in the absence of
EGFR. The inhibition of HER2 kinase at submicromolar levels also
translates into the effective inhibition of Akt and mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. We further show that,
in the absence of EGFR, erlotinib effectively inhibits HER2/HER3driven signaling and cell proliferation. These findings indicate that
direct inhibition of HER2 may account for a portion of the overall
responsiveness to erlotinib in HER2-driven and HER2/HER3-driven
signaling.

Materials and Methods
Materials. NR6 cells were kindly provided by Mark Pegram (University of
California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; ref. 29) and maintained in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% calf serum. The NCI-H1666 cell line was
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in a
50:50 mixture of F12 Ham’s medium and DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum.
Cetuximab was purchased from St. Mary’s pharmacy. The EGF-like
domain of HRGh177-241 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as
described previously (30).
Antibodies. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20H) conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories
(Lexington, KY). Anti-HER2 (Ab-17) was obtained from Lab Vision Corp.
(Fremont, CA). Anti-HER3 (C-17) and anti-EGFR (1005) were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against pHER3, pAkt
(Ser473), pAkt (Thr308), Akt, pMAPK, and p44/42MAPK were purchased from
Cell Signaling.
Expression constructs and infection of NR6 cells. Full-length HER2
cDNA was subcloned into the LNCX retroviral vector, HER3 cDNA was
introduced into the LHCX vector, and the EGFR cDNA was subcloned into
MSCVneo vector. All retroviral vectors were purchased from BD Biosciences
Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The expression construct for the chimeric EGFRH2 receptor encoding a molecule containing the extracellular and
transmembrane portion of EGFR and the intracellular domain of HER2
was generated by PCR. In detail, amino acids 1 to 680 of EGFR were fused to
amino acids 689 to 1,255 of HER2, creating the fusion sequence
HIVRKRTLR/RLLQETEL. The entire coding sequence of the chimeric
receptor was subcloned into MSCVneo vector, and the accuracy of the
construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The retroviral constructs were
transfected into the Phoenix amphotropic packaging cell line using
LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the recommendation of the
manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Viral particles were harvested
48 h after transfection and NR6 cells were infected. Stable populations were
selected using the appropriate selection markers.
Western blot analysis. For biochemical characterization, cells were
plated in six-well plates. Following serum starvation, EGFR and EGFR-H2
chimera-expressing cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations
of transforming growth factor a (TGFa) for 12 min. HER2/HER3-expressing
cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of heregulin for 8
min. Total cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were
probed with various antibodies. Western blots were quantitated by
densitometry, and the results are shown as percentage of control. H1666
cells were plated in 12-well plates and treated as above.
Cell proliferation assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plates (NR6, 3,000
per well; H1666, 5,000 per well) and incubated overnight at 37jC. The next
day, medium was removed and cells were stimulated with indicated
concentrations of ligand in 1% (NR6) or 0.1% (H1666) serum-containing
growth medium. After 3 to 4 days, Alamar Blue (Trek Diagnostic Systems,
Cleveland, OH) was added to the wells and fluorescence was read using a

www.aacrjournals.org

96-well fluorometer with excitation at 530 nm and emission of 590 nm.
The results are expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU). For growth
inhibition assays, erlotinib or cetuximab was administered with ligand,
and assay was done as stated above.

Results
Because constitutive, homodimeric activation of HER2 requires
very high HER2 levels, we examined the effects of erlotinib on
the HER2 kinase using a chimeric receptor composed of the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of EGFR fused to the
intracellular domain of HER2 (31). This allowed us to activate
HER2 using the EGFR ligand TGFa. The chimeric receptor, which
we called EGFR-H2, was stably expressed in the NR6 derivative of
the NIH3T3 cell line. NR6 cells lack endogenous EGFR and
therefore do not respond to EGFR ligands. Although ligand
stimulation was required for activation of the EGFR-H2 chimera,
the activation did not result from transactivation by a different
member of the HER receptor family. Therefore, EGFR-H2 activation
was similar to a homodimeric activation that occurs when fulllength HER2 is expressed at high levels. An EGFR-expressing NR6
line was generated as a control (Fig. 1A).
Biochemical and in vitro characterization of EGFR-H2expressing cells. To validate the use of our engineered cells
for drug studies, we first determined whether the EGFR-H2expressing line responded appropriately to ligand treatment.
Cells were stimulated with TGFa and then lysed, and the levels
of receptor autophosphorylation were assessed using antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots. The Western blots were quantitated by densitometry, and the results were then plotted. As
shown in Fig. 1, receptor phosphorylation of EGFR-H2 (Fig. 1B) as
well as EGFR (Fig. 1C) was seen in a TGFa dose-dependent
manner. The EC50 for EGFR-H2 receptor phosphorylation was
0.49 nmol/L, f2.5-fold higher than the EC50 value measured for
EGFR of 0.19 nmol/L.
The two major downstream signaling pathways that are
activated in response to EGFR phosphorylation are the Ras/MAPK
and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. We
examined whether the EGFR-H2 chimeric receptor was capable of
activating these pathways in NR6 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, TGFa
treatment of cells expressing EGFR-H2 induced phosphorylation of
p44/42MAPK in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the trend for
the autophosphorylation of the chimeric receptor, the measured
EC50 for the EGFR-H2 cell line was 0.29 nmol/L, whereas the EC50
for activation of p44/42MAPK in the EGFR-expressing cells was
0.17 nmol/L (Fig. 1C). Akt phosphorylation also occurred in EGFRH2 cells in response to TGFa stimulation. An EC50 of 0.21 nmol/L
was observed in the EGFR-H2 cells compared with an EC50 of
0.08 nmol/L in the control EGFR-expressing cells (Fig. 1B and C,
respectively).
These data confirmed that the EGFR-H2 kinase can be activated
by TGFa and that, once activated, the chimeric receptor
transduced a signal similar to that of EGFR. TGFa was f2.5
times less potent in activating the EGFR-H2 receptor kinase versus
wild-type EGFR based on receptor phosphorylation. It was about
1.7 and 2.6 times less potent in activating p44/42MAPK and Akt,
respectively, in EGFR-H2 NR6 cells versus the EGFR NR6 control
cells.
Results from cell proliferation experiments were consistent with
these biochemical data. EGFR-H2, EGFR, and the parental NR6
cells were treated with various concentrations of TGFa for 3 days
and their growth rates were measured using Alamar Blue

densitometry, and the results are shown as percentage of control. C, EGFR-expressing cells were treated as described in (B ), and immunoblots were probed with

reduction. As shown in Fig. 1D, the EGFR-H2 cells as well as EGFRexpressing cells proliferated on ligand stimulation with EC50s of
2.1 and 0.59 nmol/L, respectively. As expected, parental NR6 cells
did not grow on addition of TGFa.
Erlotinib inhibits the HER2 kinase directly. The biochemical
and biological responses of EGFR-H2 cells to TGFa stimulation
were very similar to those of the EGFR line, and we therefore
considered it as a good model system for examining the effects of
the inhibitor erlotinib on the HER2 kinase. EGFR-H2 and control
EGFR-expressing cells were pretreated with various concentrations
of erlotinib prior to ligand stimulation, and receptor phosphorylation status was analyzed by immunoblots (Fig. 2A). Interestingly,
despite the 40- to 3,000-fold difference in activity in in vitro kinase
assays (26, 27), erlotinib had a profound effect on the HER2 kinase
in our cell-based assays. EGFR-H2 receptor phosphorylation was
inhibited by erlotinib with an IC50 of 230 nmol/L. As expected,
erlotinib blocked EGFR receptor phosphorylation with an IC50 of
20 nmol/L (Fig. 2B). This measured inhibitory concentration for the
EGFR cell line was similar to previously published IC50 data
obtained from high EGFR-expressing cancer cell lines (25).
Because erlotinib efficiently blocked receptor phosphorylation in
both cell lines, albeit with less potency for the EGFR-H2 kinase, we
next examined the effect of erlotinib on the downstream MAPK
and Akt signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 2, erlotinib inhibited
phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK in EGFR-H2-expressing cells
and also in EGFR-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner.
The IC50 values were 290 and 170 nmol/L, respectively. Interestingly, despite the >10-fold difference in IC50 values for receptor
phosphorylation for the two cell lines, the IC50 values for p42/p44
MAPK differed by only f2-fold. Similar experiments done on
breast cancer lines have revealed that inhibition of receptor
activation and downstream signaling are not necessarily directly
proportional (6). We also measured the inhibitory effects of
erlotinib on Akt, a major focal point in the cell survival pathway.
The measured IC50 value in EGFR-H2-expressing cells was 210
nmol/L, and the IC50 value in the EGFR line was 40 nmol/L.
Inhibition of cell proliferation. After we established that
erlotinib prevented signaling by the HER2 kinase, we examined
whether this inhibitory effect was also translated into growth
inhibition. EGFR and EGFR-H2 cells were treated with various
concentrations of erlotinib in the presence of 3 nmol/L TGFa, and
cell proliferation was measured after 3 days using Alamar Blue
staining. Consistent with what has previously been shown for
various cancer cell lines (32), erlotinib strongly inhibited the
growth of EGFR-expressing cells with an IC50 of 260 nmol/L.
Erlotinib also inhibited the proliferation of the EGFR-H2 line
despite the fact that these cells did not express EGFR. As expected,
the potency was lower compared with what was observed for the
EGFR-expressing line. Cell growth was inhibited with an IC50 of
1.4 Amol/L in the EGFR-H2 cells (Fig. 2C). In spite of its lower
potency against the HER2 kinase, erlotinib effectively blocked
proliferation of EGFR-H2 cells.
Generation of HER2/HER3-expressing NR6 cells. As mentioned earlier, the HER2 kinase can also be indirectly activated by
ligands through the formation of heterodimeric complexes with
other HER receptors that are capable of binding their cognate
ligand. We chose to study the effect of erlotinib on the HER2/HER3
heterodimer because HER3 is the preferred partner of HER2 and
the resulting complex is more active than any other HER receptor
combination in terms of signaling (33) and transforming potential
(34, 35).

www.aacrjournals.org

We engineered NR6 cells to coexpress HER2 and HER3 and
confirmed that they would respond biochemically and biologically
as expected as we described earlier for the EGFR-H2 cells. In this
case, however, the cells were stimulated with the HER3 ligand
heregulin. To detect an active receptor complex in the HER2/HER3expressing line, we stimulated the cells with various concentrations
of heregulin for 8 min and then determined HER3 phosphorylation
by immunoblots using a HER3 phospho-specific antibody. As
shown in Fig. 3A, ligand treatment led to a dose-dependent
increase in HER3 phosphorylation. Quantification of the Western
blot by densitometry revealed an EC50 of 0.09 nmol/L. Heregulininduced activation of the receptor complex also resulted in the
phosphorylation of the downstream molecules MAPK and Akt. The
measured EC50 values were 0.17 and 0.22 nmol/L, respectively
(Fig. 3B). The ability of HER2/HER3-expressing cells to proliferate
in response to heregulin was also assessed. The cells were treated
with various concentrations of heregulin for 3 days, and their
growth response was determined by Alamar Blue staining. HER2/
HER3-expressing cells responded to heregulin with an EC50 of 0.38
nmol/L, whereas the parental cells did not grow under these
conditions (Fig. 3C).
Erlotinib inhibits heregulin-stimulated HER2 kinase activity. HER3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity and cannot transduce a
signal by itself (33). Instead, it requires the presence of a partner
receptor, such as HER2, which is catalytically active and can be
transactivated. For this reason, any inhibitory effects of erlotinib on
the HER2/HER3 cell line result from the effects of erlotinib on the
HER2 kinase. We first explored whether erlotinib could block
ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation in the HER2/HER3expressing cells. Cells were pretreated with various concentrations
of erlotinib prior to ligand stimulation, and HER2/HER3 phosphorylation status was analyzed by immunoblots (Fig. 4A). Erlotinib
inhibited the HER2 kinase in the HER2/HER3-expressing cells
with an IC50 of 150 nmol/L (Fig. 4B). Erlotinib also inhibited the
phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK in HER2/HER3-expressing cells
in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 160 nmol/L.
Moreover, it also inhibited Akt phosphorylation in HER2/HER3
cells with a measured IC50 value of 720 nmol/L (Fig. 4B).
Inhibition of heregulin-stimulated cell proliferation. We
next investigated if the growth of HER2/HER3-expressing cells was
also inhibited by erlotinib. Cells were stimulated with 1 nmol/L
heregulin in the presence of various concentrations of erlotinib.
The extent of cell proliferation was measured after 3 days using
Alamar Blue staining. As with the EGFR-H2 line, erlotinib inhibited
the proliferation of the HER2/HER3-expressing line with an IC50
value of 690 nmol/L despite the fact that these cells did not express
EGFR (Fig. 4C).
Effect of erlotinib on the NSCLC line H1666. After we
established that erlotinib was capable of inhibiting the HER2
kinase in the engineered cell lines, we asked whether the inhibitory
effect could also be seen in a nonengineered cancer cell line. H1666
cells were chosen because this NSCLC line expresses HER2 and
HER3 and responds well to heregulin stimulation (Fig. 5A, lane 2).
Like most other lung cancer lines, H1666 cells also express EGFR
and respond to EGFR ligands (Fig. 5A, lane 11). To examine the
effects of erlotinib on HER2 in the absence of EGFR signaling,
we blocked the ligand binding and dimerization capability of
EGFR with the EGFR ectodomain-specific antibody cetuximab.
Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that sterically hinders the
EGFR ectodomain and prevents it from adopting the extended
conformation necessary for ligand binding and dimerization (36).

Figure 3. Heregulin (HRG ) induces receptor phosphorylation, MAPK, and Akt activation and induces cell growth in HER2/HER3-expressing cells. A, cells were
seeded in 24-well plates and serum starved for 3 h before ligand stimulation. Heregulin stimulation was done for 8 min with indicated concentrations. Whole-cell lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and immunoblots were probed with anti–P-HER3 (aP-HER3) or anti-HER2 (aHER2) as loading control. B, immunoblots were
also probed with P-MAPK, total MAPK, P-Akt (Ser473 + Thr308), and total Akt antibodies. The blots were quantitated by densitometry, and the results are percentage of

described in Fig. 1. Representative of three independent experiments.

Treating H1666 cells with saturating amounts of cetuximab
eliminated EGFR signaling, although the receptor was still physically present on the cells (Fig. 5A, lane 15).
Erlotinib inhibits heregulin-dependent activation of H1666
cells in the presence or absence of cetuximab. Heregulin
treatment induced receptor phosphorylation in H1666 cells
regardless of whether cetuximab was present or not. As shown in
Fig. 5A, addition of 2 nmol/L heregulin resulted in a strong increase
of HER3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3) in both the
absence and the presence of 20 Ag/mL cetuximab. In contrast, the
TGFa-induced EGFR receptor phosphorylation was fully inhibited
by the presence of 20 Ag/mL cetuximab (Fig. 5A, lane 15). These
results confirmed that heregulin-mediated signaling, in contrast to
TGFa-mediated signaling, does not depend on EGFR.
We next incubated the cells with various concentrations of
erlotinib prior to ligand stimulation both in the presence and in the
absence of cetuximab. HER3 receptor phosphorylation was
completely abrogated with 5 Amol/L erlotinib (Fig. 5A, lane 6),
whereas 1 Amol/L erlotinib decreased receptor phosphorylation by
76% (Fig. 5A, lane 5). As anticipated and shown previously, erlotinib
inhibited TGFa-induced receptor phosphorylation more potently.
Treatment with 0.1 Amol/L erlotinib decreased EGFR phosphorylation by 65% (Fig. 5A, lane 12), and treatment with 1 Amol/L
erlotinib abolished receptor phosphorylation completely (Fig. 5A,
lane 13). The presence of saturating concentrations of cetuximab
in heregulin-treated cells did not change the activity of erlotinib
(Fig. 5A, lanes 7–9), again indicating that EGFR is not participating

www.aacrjournals.org

in this aspect of the inhibitory activity of erlotinib on the HER2/
HER3 complex.
The inhibitory effect of erlotinib was also assessed on the
downstream target MAPK using phospho-specific antibodies.
MAPK was inhibited by erlotinib in the absence (Fig. 5A, lanes
4–6) or presence (Fig. 5A, lanes 7–9) of cetuximab, indicating
that EGFR signaling is not required for drug sensitivity in
heregulin-stimulated cells. Cetuximab alone, however, completely
inhibited MAPK activation in TGFa-stimulated cells (Fig. 5A,
lane 15).
Erlotinib abrogates heregulin-induced growth in H1666
cells in the presence of cetuximab. Ultimately, we wanted to
determine whether erlotinib could inhibit heregulin-driven growth
in H1666 cells. H1666 cells were plated in 96-well plates in 0.1%
serum-containing medium. The cells underwent different treatments, and cell growth was measured after 5 days using Alamar
Blue staining.
As shown in Fig. 5B, heregulin treatment stimulated the growth
of H1666 cells, and cetuximab had essentially no effect on this
stimulation. TGFa also induced proliferation of the H1666 cells
but, as anticipated, the effect was abrogated by the presence of
cetuximab. To obtain IC50 values, we treated H1666 cells with
various concentrations of erlotinib and measured ligand-dependent
cell growth in the presence or absence of cetuximab (Fig. 5C).
Heregulin-driven proliferation was inhibited by erlotinib with an
IC50 of 700 nmol/L regardless of whether cetuximab was present
or not. TGFa-stimulated growth was repressed by erlotinib with an

IC50 of 300 nmol/L. As expected, significant cell growth did not
occur when TGFa-stimulated cells were treated additionally with
cetuximab. The heregulin-stimulated proliferation of H1666 cells
in the presence of saturating concentrations of cetuximab
indicated that HER2/HER3 heterodimer complexes play an
important role in the growth and survival of these cells. The fact
that erlotinib suppressed the proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner showed that this inhibitor effectively blocked the HER2
kinase, albeit with a lower potency in comparison with its effect on
the EGFR kinase.
The engineered EGFR-H2 and HER2/HER3 cell lines enabled us
to study the effect of erlotinib on the HER2 kinase in the absence of
endogenous EGFR. With this system, we were able to clearly
distinguish a direct effect of erlotinib on HER2 from possible
indirect effects that might be facilitated through EGFR/HER2
cooperation. Using the EGFR-H2 chimera, we showed that erlotinib

can directly inhibit the HER2 kinase when it is activated through
the formation of a homodimeric complex. We also showed that
erlotinib effectively inhibits the most prominent heterodimeric
complex in the HER receptor family—the HER2/HER3 heterodimer.
The dose-dependent inhibition was seen at the receptor level, on
downstream signaling molecules, and was also translated into
inhibition of cell growth.

Discussion
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in HER2-overexpressing cells results in decreased basal receptor phosphorylation of
EGFR and HER2 (21, 28). Thus far, it is unclear whether this
decreased phosphorylation is due to direct inhibition of both HER2
and EGFR receptors or to direct inhibition of EGFR and the
subsequent loss of HER2 transactivation.

Cancer Research

In this study, we set out to determine whether some portion of
the antiproliferative effects of erlotinib can be attributed to direct
inhibition of the HER2 kinase. We first showed that, in intact cells,
erlotinib was capable of inhibiting an EGFR-H2 chimeric receptor
at submicromolar levels following activation by an EGFR ligand.
The inhibition at the receptor level translated into the potent
inhibition of downstream signaling molecules and resulted in a
marked decrease in cell proliferation. The EGFR-H2 chimeric
receptor enabled us to recapitulate homodimeric activation of the
HER2 kinase; the mode of activation that is predominantly seen in
HER2-overexpressing cells. Because NR6 cells lack EGFR expression, we showed that erlotinib blocked the HER2 kinase directly.
We found that erlotinib was only f12-fold less active against HER2
kinase versus the EGFR kinase in intact cells. These results are in
strong contrast to the 40- to 3,000-fold difference in potency that
has been seen in purified enzymatic assays. One potential
explanation for the substantial difference may be that erlotinib is
a far better inhibitor of the HER2 kinase in intact cells because
the in vitro kinase format may not recapitulate how HER2 is
presented in the cell membrane. Hence, higher IC50 values are
obtained in in vitro kinase assays.
The potent inhibition of HER2 kinase by EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors has been reported previously (21–23). However, since the
in vitro kinase assays suggested that erlotinib or gefitinib was
incapable of inhibiting the HER2 kinase at submicromolar levels,
an alternative mechanism of action was proposed. In the presence
of EGFR, HER2 forms functional heterodimers with EGFR upon
ligand stimulation that in turn result in the transphosphorylation
of HER2. It was suggested that EGFR inhibitors efficiently hinder
the transphosphorylation of HER2 but do not block HER2 function
directly. However, based on our data, the activity of EGFR kinase
inhibitors on HER2-overexpressing cells can be attributed to the
direct inhibition of HER2 kinase. In accordance with our findings, a
study by Wels et al. (37) shows that an EGFR-neutralizing antibody
is unable to inhibit cell proliferation of HER2-overexpressing

SKBR3 cells, yet SKBR3 cells are very sensitive to EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors. Because SKBR3 cells express HER2 in large excess
over EGFR, it is unlikely that the potent down-regulation of HER2
in SKBR3 cells is solely due to the inhibition of cross-talk between
EGFR and HER2. It is more likely that the direct inhibition of HER2,
in conjunction with some disruption of EGFR/HER2 cross-talk,
leads to the profound antiproliferative effect of EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors on HER2-overexpressing cells.
Although HER2 overexpression is observed in 20% to 30% of
all breast cancers, the frequency of HER2 overexpression in most
other tumor types is low (38). When HER2 levels are low, HER2
signaling is mediated by a second receptor in a heterodimeric
complex. Because HER3 is the preferred heterodimeric partner of
HER2 and is the most common mediator of ligand-stimulated
HER2 activation (2, 33), we examined the inhibitory effects of
erlotinib on the heregulin-dependent activation of HER2/HER3
heterodimers in cells that lack EGFR. Inhibition of receptor
phosphorylation as well as Akt and MAPK activation was
achieved using submicromolar concentrations of erlotinib. Heregulin-induced cell growth was also effectively inhibited in these
cell lines. Because HER3 is catalytically inactive and cannot
signal by itself, these results indicated that erlotinib directly
blocked HER2 kinase and, consequently, prevented HER3 transphosphorylation.
Our findings agree with a previously published report that
gefitinib potently inhibits ligand-driven HER2/HER3 signaling in
various breast cancer cells (28). Contrary to our interpretation,
Anido et al. postulate that inhibition of HER2 occurs through
the formation of inactive EGFR/HER2 and EGFR/HER3 heterodimers and not through direct inhibition of HER2. These
inactive heterodimers sequester HER2 and prevent the formation of active HER2/HER3 heterodimers. This model, however,
implies that only cells that express significant amounts of EGFR
in relation to HER2 will respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. Our findings and a recent report describing the

Figure 6. Schematic diagram of the
inhibitory action of erlotinib. Erlotinib
effectively inhibits EGFR (blue ) kinase and
signaling when it is activated by either
homodimeric or heterodimeric receptorreceptor interactions. These interactions
are driven by ligand binding as indicated in
the first two representations on the left.
HER2 (green) also forms activated
homodimeric and heterodimeric
complexes, but HER2 homodimers
(right ) can form in the absence of ligand
stimulation. Erlotinib is capable of
blocking the signaling activity of HER2 in
homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes
even when EGFR is not present, albeit
with lower potency in comparison with its
effect on the EGFR kinase.

potent effect of gefitinib on the inhibition of HER2/HER3
signaling in NSCLC cells that have no detectable EGFR (39) do
not support this model.
As mentioned previously, EGFR, HER2, and HER3 activate the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The activation of this pathway is most
efficiently mediated through HER3 because only HER3 has multiple
binding sites for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (40, 41). In
contrast, EGFR predominantly activates PI3K via the adaptor
protein GrbB2-associated binder 1 (42, 43). Additionally, in the
presence of EGFR and HER3, PI3K can be stimulated via ligandinduced EGFR/HER3 heterodimers (44). Gefitinib sensitivity in
NSCLC lines has been strongly linked to the down-regulation of the
PI3K/Akt pathway, and loss of HER3 activation seems to be an
important prerequisite for the sensitivity (45, 46). The authors
propose the direct inhibition of EGFR/HER3 as the mechanism of
action. Interestingly, all of the sensitive lines also express HER2.
Given our data, one can imagine that the potent down-regulation
of the survival pathway in HER2-overexpressing cells may also
occur via the inhibition of HER2/HER3 heterodimers especially in
cases where EGFR expression is low.
In conclusion, we have shown that erlotinib directly blocks HER2
activity regardless of whether HER2 was activated by either
homodimeric association or heterodimeric transactivation with
HER3. These modes of inhibition are summarized schematically in
Fig. 6. In both cases, erlotinib also inhibited the activation of

downstream signaling intermediates and suppressed cell proliferation in the absence of EGFR.
Based on our study, we speculate that erlotinib may have a
much wider therapeutic potential and that, in addition to EGFRexpressing tumors, it may also be useful against HER2overexpressing tumors. Pharmacokinetic studies determined that
a daily oral dose of 150 mg erlotinib, which is the maximal
tolerated dose, translates into a mean serum concentration of 3 to
10 Amol/L (47, 48). Because f90% of erlotinib is bound to serum
protein, the free drug concentration is approximately 0.3 to
1 Amol/L. Therefore, it is unlikely that erlotinib effectively inhibits
HER2 activity in a wide range of patients. Yet, some individuals
might benefit from this therapy because plasma concentrations of
erlotinib vary substantially among individuals (49). If higher drug
exposure could be achieved potentially through pulse dosing or i.v.
administration, erlotinib may very well efficiently block HER2
function in a substantial number of patients bearing tumors that
are driven by either EGFR or HER2 activation.
