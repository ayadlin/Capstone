ABSTRACT:
In a previous study, we reported that sodium orthovanadate (vanadate) is the
first known inhibitor that is capable of protecting mice from death from the radiationinduced gastrointestinal syndrome via its ability to block both transcription-dependent
and transcription-independent p53 apoptotic pathways. In this paper, we report
that vanadate has a unique activity for inducing the denaturation of p53 relative to
other known radioprotective p53 inhibitors, pifithrin-α (PFTα) and pifithrin-µ (PFTµ).
This potent radioprotective effect of vanadate prompted us to undertake a more
extensive search for p53 inhibitors that can induce p53 denaturation. Based on the
fact that p53 denaturation can be induced by the dissociation of a zinc ion, which
is used as a structural factor of p53, we screened some zinc (II) chelators for the
suppression of the DNA binding activity of p53 in vitro and the inhibition of radiationinduced p53-dependent apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells. The findings indicate that two
of five zinc (II) chelators also suppressed apoptosis. Among the inhibitors tested,
Bispicen (N,N’-Bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine) had the highest inhibition
activity. A mechanistic study using cells bearing different p53 status or functions (i.e.,
p53-knockdown MOLT-4 transformant and its revertants, p53 mutant cells, p53-null
cells), and p53-independent apoptotic stimuli revealed that the suppressive effect
of Bispicen on apoptosis is specifically mediated through p53. Moreover, Bispicen,
similar to vanadate, induces the denaturation of p53 as well as the blocking of both
transcription-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. Our findings indicate
that the use of zinc (II) chelators represent a new approach for protecting against
radiation-induced p53-dependent apoptosis through the inhibition of p53-dependent
apoptotic pathways.

INTRODUCTION

structural alterations, resulting in the inactivation of the
p53 protein [13-19]. We therefore expected that removing
the zinc ion from the ZBS would be an effective means
of inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis. Although when Zn2+
was substituted with Cd2+ and Zn2+ was chelated by TPEN
(tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine), a potent Zn2+
chelator [20], p53 denaturation was induced and p53mediated growth arrest was suppressed [17, 18], there
has been no report that these agents can suppress p53mediated apoptosis, presumably due to their cytotoxicity.
Only a cadmium test previously reported by us suggests
the availability of this ZBS-targeting strategy [7]. In this
previous work, cadmium was shown to be able to suppress
radiation-induced p53-dependent apoptosis within a very
narrow effective concentration range. However, the
strategy for inhibiting radiation-induced p53-dependent
apoptosis that involves the use of heavy metals usually
involves the development of toxic symptoms. Thus, it is
important to identify organic zinc (II) chelators with high
anti-apoptotic activity and low-toxicity that target the ZBS
of p53.
In this study, we examined the effect of vanadate on
the denaturation of p53 [6], and found that vanadate has
a unique activity in inducing a p53 denaturation relative
to the other two radioprotective p53 inhibitors, PFTα and
PFTµ. We therefore postulated that the activity should
be responsible for the potent radioprotective effect of
vanadate, and initiated a search for a zinc (II) chelator that
is capable of suppressing p53-dependent apoptosis and
also inducing p53 denaturation. We evaluated five zinc
(II) chelators as candidates for novel p53 inhibitors. As
a result, two zinc (II) chelators were found to suppress
p53-dependent apoptosis in irradiated MOLT-4 cells.
Especially, Bispicen (N,N’-Bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2ethanediamine), having the high efficacy in the inhibition
of apoptosis, showed activity for p53 denaturation as well
as on the inhibition of both the transcription-dependent
and -independent apoptotic pathways. Our findings
indicate that the use of zinc (II) chelators represent a
potentially viable approach for inhibiting p53-dependent
apoptosis.

Radiation therapy and some chemotherapeutic
agents mainly target the DNA of growing cancer cells,
and such therapies frequently have adverse side effects on
normal tissues and cells, including p53-induced apoptosis
[1]. In contrast, many types of cancers tend to have a
lower incidence of p53-mediated apoptosis, because the
function of their p53s is often suppressed or lost during
cancer development [2]. Thus, a chemical inhibitor that
suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis would be expected
to partially prevent the damage of normal tissues during
treatments of p53-deficient tumors [1].
p53 is considered to be a target for therapeutic and
mitigative radioprotection to escape the apoptotic fate.
In fact, p53-knockout mice are protected from sublethal
doses of irradiation (IR) that cause the hematopoietic
syndrome [3]. Three radioprotective p53 inhibitors
have been reported to date, namely, pifithrin-α (PFTα),
pifithrin-µ (PFTµ), and sodium orthovanadate (vanadate)
[3-8]. These p53 inhibitors protect mice from the acute
lethality associated with the hematopoietic syndrome,
indicating that the temporary, pharmacological
suppression of p53 is an effective strategy for minimizing
radiation damage. In addition, a recent study has shown
that the short-term inhibition of p53 (only during the acute
radiation syndrome, but not the later oncogenic stressrelated radiation response) does not result in an increase
in tumorigenesis, which also ensures radioprotection by
p53 inhibition [9].
Among the three radioprotective p53 inhibitors
mentioned above, vanadate was found to have a more
potent radioprotective activity than PFTα and PFTµ [7].
We previously postulated that the powerful radioprotective
activity of vanadate appears to be due to its wide spectrum
of anti-p53 activity against both the p53-mediated
transcription-dependent and transcription-independent
pathways, whereas that of the anti-p53 activity of PFTs is
restricted. PFTα is most likely specific to p53 transcription
[7, 10-12], and PFTµ is specific to the transcriptionindependent function of p53 [5]. In total-body IR (TBI)
experiments, neither PFTα nor PFTµ were found to protect
mice from gastrointestinal syndrome-induced death,
whereas vanadate acts as a more potent radioprotector that
can protect, at least partially, mice from gastrointestinal
syndrome-induced death [3, 5, 7].
Our results obtained in series of studies of vanadate
also provide theoretically and practically an important hint
to the mechanism of its action. We focused the majority
of our attention on the unique activity of vanadate for
inducing the denaturation of p53 [6]. On the other hand,
p53 denaturation is induced by the dissociation (or
substitution) of a zinc ion, which is coordinated to a metal
ion binding site on p53 [13]. The zinc binding site (ZBS)
in the p53 protein is essential for DNA transcription,
and thus zinc chelation and metal exchange can cause

RESULTS
Vanadate has a unique activity in inducing a
denaturation of p53 relative to the other two
radioprotective p53 inhibitors, PFTα and PFTµ
We initially investigated the effect of three
radioprotective p53 inhibitors on the conformation of
p53 by means of immunoprecipitation with an anti-p53
PAb 240 monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a specific probe
for the conformationally inactivated form of p53 [18, 19,
21, 22]. Under nondenaturing conditions, PAb 240 mAb

recognized the inactivated form of p53 but not the normal
form, whereas the DO-1 mAb recognizes both forms [6].
For the immunoprecipitation experiment, we used 800 µM,
50 µM, and 7.5 µM concentrations of vanadate, PFTα, and
PFTµ, respectively. Each concentration was an optimal
dose, as determined in a previous study, for suppressing
apoptosis in 10 Gy-irradiated MOLT-4 cells [7]. As shown
previously [6], PAb240 mAb immunoprecipitated the
p53 from irradiated MOLT-4 cells that had been treated
with vanadate (Fig. 1). However, PFTα and PFTµ did
not induce any detectable conformational change. These
data indicate that only vanadate is able to induce the
denaturation of p53. We therefore postulated that the
activity might be responsible for the potent radioprotective
effect of vanadate, and then began a search for a zinc (II)
chelator capable of suppressing p53-dependent apoptosis
and inducing p53 denaturation.

the in vitro DNA-binding activity of recombinant FLAGtagged p53 (FLAG-p53) by means of an electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA), which revealed that four
chelators (but not BPA), inhibit complex formation of
DNA with FLAG-p53 (Fig. 3).

Bispicen showed the highest inhibitory activity on
radiation-induced apoptosis
The effect of the five chelators on intracellular p53
activity was examined with reference to p53-dependent
apoptosis in irradiated MOLT-4 cells. The results of the
dye-exclusion test as a method for determining cell death
(Fig. 4A) and MitoTracker staining for measuring the loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential (loss of Δψm; Fig.
4B) suggested that Bispicen potently suppressed apoptosis,
while TPEN, cyclen, and BPA have negligible effects on
apoptosis. TPA was a weak suppressor of cell death, and
moderately suppressed the loss of Δψm (Fig. 4A, B),
probably due to its cytotoxicity (Fig. 4A; open circles).
TPEN also failed to suppress apoptosis (remarkably, at
10 µM), possibly due to its cytotoxicity as well. Cyclen
had no effect on apoptosis, despite its strong affinity for
Zn2+, possibly because this molecule is hydrophilic and its
membrane permeability is very low. BPA appeared to fail
to suppress apoptosis due to its low zinc binding constant
and low-affinity for p53.
We also examined the effect of five chelators on
caspase activation. Bispicen suppressed caspase-3 and
-7 activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C).
In contrast, TPEN and TPA suppressed the activation
at moderate concentrations, but their inhibitory effects
decreased with increasing concentration, except for 10
µM TPEN, which suppressed the activation of caspase-3
but not caspase-7. Cyclen and BPA had little effect on the
activation. Considering these collective data, it can be

Five zinc (II) chelators were evaluated
Figure 2 shows the structural formula, coordination
number, and intrinsic binding constant with zinc (log
Ks(ZnL)) for each zinc (II) chelator tested in this work.
These binding constant values were reported in previous
studies [23-27]. These five compounds can be classified
into two groups with respect to binding constant: a higheraffinity group (two compounds; upper panel of Fig. 2)
having log Ks(ZnL) values of > 15, and a lower-affinity
group (three compounds; lower panel of Fig. 2) having
log Ks(ZnL) values of < 15. The former group consists of
TPEN, and cyclen (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane), and
the latter includes Bispicen, TPA (tris(2-pyridylmethyl)
amine), and BPA (bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine). Among
the five chelators, only TPEN was reported to induce the
denaturation of p53 [18].
We analyzed the effect of these zinc (II) chelators on

unirradiated (1st lane) or 10 Gy-irradiated (2nd lane) MOLT-4
cells cultured for 6 h were used, respectively, as the negative and
positive controls for p53. The p53 from WCLs (lanes 1 and 2)
and the immunoprecipitated p53 (lanes 3 to 7) were visualized
by immunoblotting using anti-p53 DO-1 mAb

have mutation(s) in the core domain of p53 [28-30]; p53null cell lines [31, 32]; MOLT-4 cells stimulated by p53independent apoptotic stimuli, anisomycin [6] and C2ceramide [33].
Figure 5A shows immunoblotting data for p53
expression in a series of MOLT-4 transformants. KD-1
and mock vector-transfectant KD-1/Hygro showed only
a slight increase in p53 protein expression, even after
IR (Fig. 5A), and these cells were resistant to radiationinduced apoptosis, although it partially occurred (Fig.
5B). In contrast, p53 protein expression for the newly
established revertants, KD-1/R-p53-1 and -2, after IR,
were comparable relative to that of parental MOLT-4 and
MOLT-4-derived negative control shRNA-expressing
clone (MOLT-4/Nega; Nega) (Fig. 5A). The sensitivity of
the revertants to radiation was restored to that observed in
MOLT-4 and Nega cells (Fig. 5B). For the effectiveness
of Bispicen, its anti-apoptotic activity was limited to
cells expressing p53 or FLAG-p53 (MOLT, Nega, KD-1/
R-p53-1, and KD-1/R-p53-2), but not the p53-knockdown
KD-1 and KD-1/Hygro cells that showed partial death
followed IR (Fig. 5B), indicating that p53 is prerequisite
for the suppression of apoptosis by Bispicen.
As presented in Figure 6A and B, the effect of
Bispicen on etoposide-induced apoptosis was investigated
in p53-mutated leukemia cell lines, KU812 (K132R),
CCRF-CEM (R175H/R248Q), and Ball-1 (D281G), and
p53-null cell lines, HL60 and U937 [28-32]. Bispicen
also suppressed etoposide-induced apoptosis in MOLT4 cells, while showing no protective effect on any of
the p53-impaired cells. Furthermore, Bispicen did not
suppress MOLT-4 apoptosis induced by p53-independent
apoptotic stimuli, anisomycin and C2-ceramide (Fig. 6C).
These data strongly suggest that the suppression of DNAdamage-induced apoptosis by Bispicen occurs specifically
via p53.

Bispicen exerted anti-apoptotic activity in a p53dependent manner
We previously used a genetic approach to
demonstrate the specificity vanadate for p53 in
suppressing DNA-damage-induced apoptosis by using
different several cell systems [6, 7]. Likewise, we
confirmed and characterized the effects of Bispicen on
p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis using several
cell systems: MOLT/p53KD-1 (KD-1), a p53-knockdown
MOLT-4 transformant expressing RNA interference–
based p53-targeting short hairpin RNA (shRNA) [6, 7];
MOLT/p53KD-1/R-p53-1, -2 (KD-1/R-p53-1, -2), MOLT/
p53KD-1-derived, newly-established revertants, each
of which expresses an shRNA-resistant, silent-mutated
FLAG-p53; p53-mutated leukemia cell lines, all of which

The effects of Bispicen on p53 denaturation as
well as on the inhibition of both the transcriptiondependent and -independent apoptotic pathways,
were similar to the effects of vanadate
To study the inhibitory mechanism of the Bispicen
against p53, we examined its effect on the conformation
of p53 by immunoprecipitation with PAb 240 mAb as
was used in Figure 1, in comparison with vanadate and
other zinc (II) chelators that can inhibit caspase activation
(TPA and TPEN). As expected, Bispicen induced p53
denaturation in a dose dependent manner, the level of
which was comparable to that for vanadate and other
chelators (Fig. 7). These data indicate the zinc (II)
chelators induce the denaturation of p53.
The conformational changes to p53 induced by zinc
(II) chelators or vanadate were also monitored by circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The negative Cotton effects

DNA-binding reactions were performed using the FITClabeled oligonucleotide probe for 3 hours at 37 °C. The reaction
mixtures were then separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C, and the
bands were quantified by fluorescence intensity measurements.

at 207 and 216 nm, which can be assigned to α-helix and
β-sheet structures in p53, respectively [34], were clearly
reduced on the addition of zinc (II) chelators or vanadate
to the solution (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, CD spectra were
restored upon the addition of an excess amount of zinc
ion (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that a conformational
change in p53 results in its being inhibited.
We next investigated the effects of the zinc (II)
chelators on p53 transactivation after IR. Bispicen, TPEN,

and TPA, but not cyclen and BPA, were found to potently
suppress the induction of two p53 target gene products,
namely, PUMA and p21, although the accumulation
of p53 was less affected (Fig. 8A). The suppression by
Bispicen, TPEN, and TPA was also verified by realtime PCR analysis of the transcription of puma and p21
(Fig. 8B). Cyclen and BPA failed to suppress apoptosis
(Fig.4), proving that their inhibitory activity against p53
transactivation is negligible.

Finally, we investigated the effect of Bispicen on
the transcription-independent p53 pathway in irradiated
MOLT-4 cells, in comparison with that of PFTµ, a
positive control inhibitor for the pathway. We first
analyzed their effects on the translocation of p53 to
mitochondria, a key initial event in this pathway [3538], in fractionated MOLT-4 cells. Subcellular Fraction 1
mainly contained mitochondria, and Fraction 2 contained
cytosolic components, as evidenced by several marker
proteins (Fig. 9A) and as described previously [7, 39].
In fractionated, irradiated MOLT-4 cells, Bispicen dosedependently reduced the post-IR p53 in Fraction 1, and
completely suppressed p53 at a level of 200 µM, similar
to that for PFTµ. Bispicen and PFTµ also suppressed the
interaction of p53 with Bcl-2, which is essential for the
direct initiation of transcription-independent apoptosis
[35, 36] (Fig. 9B). Taken together, these data indicate that
Bispicen suppresses transcription-independent apoptotic
events as well as p53 transcription.

and -independent apoptotic pathways. Our findings
indicate that the use of zinc chelators represents a new
and potentially useful approach to the inhibition of p53dependent apoptosis.
In vivo, zinc is an essential element that functions
as a co-factor for many enzymes including the free
radical scavengers, transcription factors including p53,
replication proteins, and storage proteins [40]. In addition,
caspases are the main apoptosis-executing enzymes with
a cysteine residue in the active center, which makes
them susceptible targets for transition metals, such as
zinc [41]. On the other hand, the inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins (IAPs) contains a cysteine-rich zinc-finger-like
ZBS in the BIR domain, which has the ability to inhibit
caspases [42]. Zinc deprivation by treatment with TPEN
has been reported to cause caspase-dependent apoptosis
[43]. These results imply that intracellular zinc serves as
an inhibitor of the casual activation of caspases. In fact,
TPEN elicits the sudden activation of caspases only at a
concentration of 5 µM, and the inhibitory effects of TPA
on caspases are reduced with increasing concentrations of

DISCUSSION
Five zinc (II) chelators were evaluated in a
fundamental study of the mechanism of p53 inhibition, and
Bispicen, which had the highest efficacy for the inhibition
of p53-dependent apoptosis, resulted in the denaturation of
p53 as well as inhibiting both the transcription-dependent

TPA (Fig. 4C). In contrast, Bispicen is a good inhibitor
of p53-dependent apoptosis without facilitating caspase
activation. Namely, the advantage of Bispicen appears to
be due to its moderate chelating activity that is sufficient
to inhibit p53 without triggering caspase activation. These
results suggest that p53 is more sensitive to zinc chelation
than the other zinc-requiring vital proteins.
We also postulated that p53 denaturation activity
might be responsible for the potent radioprotective activity
of vanadate and Bispicen. Of note, both vanadate and
Bispicen suppress both the p53-mediated transcriptiondependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. Since
the DNA binding domain of p53 contains a ZBS [14, 15]
and this domain is critical for both DNA binding in the
transcription-dependent pathway and the formation of a
complex with Bcl-2 family members in the transcriptionindependent pathway [36], p53 denaturation that disables
the DNA-binding activity of p53 would also result in the
inhibition of the transcription-independent pathway as

well as the transcription-dependent pathway.
Although Bispicen has an antiapoptotic advantage
in suppressing both pathways in cultured cells, it failed
to show any efficient radioprotective effect against totalbody-irradiated mice (data not shown). Unfortunately,
the highest dose of Bispicen available in mice was
substantially lower than the dose required for the
suppression of p53-dependent apoptosis in cultured cells.
However, this is the first study to demonstrate that the
chelation of zinc can efficiently inhibit p53-mediated
apoptosis. A less toxic zinc (II) chelator that functions in
vivo may serve as a therapeutic inhibitor of p53. In fact,
treatment with some metal complexes has been reported
to facilitate the survival of lethally irradiated mice and
rats, although its mechanism is not completely clear [44].
Further studies are currently in progress in attempts to
identify optimal radioprotective chelators that target the
ZBS of p53 with no substantial toxicity in vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatment
MOLT-4 cells and their derivative transformed cell
lines (MOLT/Nega, MOLT/p53KD-1, MOLT/p53KD-1/
Hygro, MOLT/p53KD-1/R-p53-1, and MOLT/p53KD1/R-p53-2), KU812, CCRF-CEM, Ball-1, HL60, and
U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Wako,
Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Gibco, GrandIsland, NY) and antibiotics
(100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Meiji
Seika, Tokyo, Japan)) [6, 7]. The medium was also
supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Enzo Life Sciences,
Farmingdale, NY) or with both 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 0.25
mg/ml Hygromycin B (Wako) for the maintenance of
G418-resistant or G418/Hygromycin B-resistant stable
transformants, respectively. Cells were maintained at
37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
To generate stable transfectants that MOLT/p53KD-1
cells (a stable p53-knockdown MOLT-4 transformant
expressing RNA interference–based p53-targeting shRNA
(IMGENX, San Diego, CA) [6]) expresses p53 shRNAresistant recombinant p53 (R-p53), MOLT/p53KD-1
cells were transfected with Bgl II-linearized R-p53-1/2
vector or mock vector (pcDNA 3.1/Hygro (+), Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) by electroporation (Gene Pulsar II, BioRad, Richmond, CA; 0.25 kV, 950 microfarads). Cell
density was determined with a cell counter (Z1 Cell
and particle counter, Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL).
Exponentially growing cell cultures (5 × 105 cells/ml) in
tissue culture plates or flasks (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln
Park, NJ) were irradiated at room temperature with a

cell lysate (WCL) from unirradiated (1st lane) or 10 Gyirradiated (2nd lane) MOLT-4 cells cultured for 6 h were used,
respectively, as the negative and positive controls for p53. The
p53 from WCLs (lanes 1 and 2) and the immunoprecipitated p53
(lanes 3 to 11) was visualized by immunoblotting using anti-p53

treated with several reagents, including etoposide (Wako),
anisomycin (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) or C2ceramide (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY)).
Vanadate, PFTα, and PFTµ were purchased from Wako,
Sigma (Saint Louis, MO), and Calbiochem, respectively.
TPEN was purchased from Wako. Cyclen was purchased
from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). Bispicen
was synthesized and purified by the procedure described
by Girerd et al. [45]. BPA was synthesized and purified
by the procedure described by Brown et al. [46]. TPA was
synthesized and purified by the procedure described by
Arnold et al. [47]. Each of the chelators or each of the p53
inhibitors was added to the culture medium immediately
after IR.

The R-p53-expressing vectors (R-p53-1 and -2)
were constructed by using Ala138 version of FLAG-p53 [7]
as template. To generate the shRNA-resistant FLAG-p53,
shRNA-target sequence, the information of which was
provided by the manufacturer (IMGENEX), was mutated
by six (R-p53-1) or five (R-p53-2) silent mutations using
the overlap extension method [48], and the products were
ligated into the Hind III/Kpn I site of the pcDNA 3.1/
Hygro (+) vector. The corresponding sequences were as
follows: original sequence, TCC AGT GGT AAT CTA;
R-p53-1, AGC AGC GGC AAC CTG; R-p53-2, TCC
AGC GGC AAC TTG. Each codon was partitioned by
space, and underlined sections denote silent mutations.

Immunoprecipitation

detection.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)

Immunoprecipitation was performed as described
previously [6]. We used anti-p53 PAb 240 (Calbiochem),
anti-p53 DO-1-conjugated agarose (Calbiochem), and
anti-Bcl-2 (7/Bcl-2, BD Transduction Laboratories,
Lexington, KY).

Recombinant FLAG-p53 was synthesized by a
silkworm-baculovirus expression system (Procube-T
system; Sysmex, Hyogo, Japan) using the Ala138
version of FLAG-p53 [7] as template, and purified
by a FLAG-affinity purification. The protocol for
the DNA-binding assays was as follows: FLAG-p53
(12.5 nM) was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the
presence of the indicated concentrations of zinc (II)
chelators in 9 µl of binding buffer containing 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40. The
samples were then mixed with 1 µl of FITC-labeled
double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (sense strand;
5’-GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3’)
[49],
and
incubated for 3 hours at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures
(10 µl of the total volume/lane) were then separated
by electrophoresis at 4 °C. The gels were visualized by
LAS-3000 (FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan). The bands were
quantified with FUJI FILM Science Lab 2001 Image
Gauge software. The binding ratio of FLAG-p53 to target
DNA was calculated using equation R = Ib/(Ib+If), where
Ib and If are the intensities of FLAG-p53-bound and free
DNA bands, respectively [50, 51].

Immunoblotting analysis
Immunoblotting was performed as described
previously [39]. We used the following antibodies
as primary antibodies: p53 (clone DO-1, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), FLAG (Monoclonal
ANTI-FLAG-M2, Sigma), β-Actin (clone AC-15, Sigma),
caspase-7 (clone 4G2, MBL, Nagoya, Japan), cleaved
caspase-3 (Asp175, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), PUMA
(Ab-1, Calbiochem), p21 (clone EA10, Calbiochem), Bcl2 (clone Bcl-2/100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bak (BakNT, Upstate), or VDAC1 (ab15895, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA). The anti-p53, anti-FLAG, and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies
were peroxidase-conjugated form, and used for direct

Apoptosis assay
Cell viability was determined by means of an
erythrosin B dye-exclusion test [52]. The percentage of
cells losing their ∆ψm was measured by MitoTracker Red
CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining with
a flow-cytometer (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson) as
described previously [6].

Real time-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from MOLT-4
cells using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system kit
(Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized by the
reverse transcription of 2 µg of total RNA with oligo (dT)
primer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative real-time
reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed on an
Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously
[8]. The primers used in these analyses were as follows:
puma, (forward) 5’-AGCCAAACGTGACCACTAGC-3’,
(reverse) 5’-GCAGAGCACAGGATTCACAG-3’; p21,
(forward) 5’-GGTGGCAGTAGAGGCTATGGACA-3’,
(reverse)
5’-GGCTCAACGTTAGTGCCAGGA-3’;
β-actin, (forward) 5’-TGGCACCCAGCACAATGAA-3’,
(reverse) 5’-CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGCA-3’.

Figure 9: Bispicen interferes with the mitochondrial
translocation of p53. A. The fractions were isolated 6 h after

10 Gy IR and treatment, and then subjected to immunoblotting
analysis of p53, mitochondrial markers (Bcl-2, Bak, and
VDAC1), with β-actin being used as a cytosolic marker. Fraction
1(F1) contained mitochondrial components, and Fraction 2(F2)
contained cytosolic components. B. Immunocoprecipitation
(IP) of Bcl-2 and p53 in irradiated MOLT-4 cells (6 h after 10

(2nd lane) MOLT-4 cells cultured for 6 h were the negative and
positive controls, respectively, for p53. They were also used as
positive controls for Bcl-2.
