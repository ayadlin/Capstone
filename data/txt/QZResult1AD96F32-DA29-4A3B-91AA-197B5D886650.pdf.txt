ABSTRACT
Inhibition of Brd4 by JQ1 treatment showed potential in the treatment of glioma,
however, some cases showed low sensitivity of JQ1. In addition, the pre-clinical
analysis showed its limitation by demonstrating that transient treatment with JQ1
leads to aggressive tumor development. Thus, an improved understanding of the
mechanisms underlying JQ1 is urgently required to design strategies to improve its
efficiency, as well as overcome its limitation. HEXIM1 has been confirmed to have an
important role in regulating JQ1 sensitivity. In our study, ubenimex, a classical anticancer drug showed potential in regulating the JQ1 sensitivity of glioma cells using
the WST-1 proliferation assay. Further studies demonstrated that ubenimex inhibited
autophagy and downregulated the autophagic degradation of HEXIM1. The role of
HEXIM1 in regulating JQ1 sensitivity was verified by the HEXIM1 knockdown. Since
ubenimex was verified as an Akt inhibitor, we further studied the role of Akt inhibition
in regulating JQ1 sensitivity and migration of glioma cells. Data showed that ubenimex
improved the efficiency of JQ1 treatment and suppressed migration both in the in vitro
and in vivo xenografts models. The Akt agonist attenuated these effects, pointing to
the role of Akt inhibition in JQ1 sensitivity and suppressed migration. Our findings
suggest the potential of ubenimex adjuvant treatment to enhance JQ1 efficiency and
attenuate parts of its side effect (enhancing tumor aggressive) by regulating the
autophagic degradation of HEXIM1 and Akt inhibition.

new agents until a novel Brd4 inhibition by JQ1
treatment showed potential in glioma treatment [1, 2].
However, some cases showed a low sensitivity of JQ1
[3, 4], while pre-clinical analysis showed its limitation
by demonstrating that transient treatment with JQ1 leads
to aggressive tumor development and, consequently,
accelerated death [5].

INTRODUCTION
Gliomas represent about 30% of brain and central
nervous system tumors. While the rate of successful
treatment of gliomas is lower, most often, high-grade
tumors show dismal prognosis. For the past 20 years,
there has been little progress in clinical trials testing

BRD4 belongs to the BET (bromodomain and
extraterminal domain) subfamily of bromodomaincontaining proteins comprised of Brd2, Brd3, Brd4, and
Brd5.BRD4 protein is elevated in gliomas and has been
demonstrated to regulate transcriptional activation of various
genes involved in sustaining growth and developmental of
tumors, and therefore, drugs targeting BET show potential
therapeutic intervention. Brd4 functions by recruiting the
p-TEFb protein complex, which is composed of cyclindependent kinase 9 and its regulatory partner cyclin T1.
P-TEFb protein complex is essential for the activation
of promoters and super-enhancers by interacting with
acetylated histones [6–8]. Multiple evidences suggest that
Brd4 regulates transcription elongation carried out by
RNA Polymerase II as well as expression of oncogenes
including Bcl2 and c-Myc [8–10]. HEXIM1(hexamethylene
bisacetamide-inducible protein 1) negatively regulates the
functional activity of p-TEFb [11, 12]. Homeostasis between
the activation of Brd4 by p-TEFb and inhibition of p-TEFb
by HEXIM1 determines the extent of BET activation [8, 9,
11, 12]. Interestingly, recent work suggests that activation
of PI3K/AKT pathway can inhibit interaction of HEKIM1
with P-TEFb, and therefore, enhance Brd4 activation [13].
Besides, the latest research has demonstrated that HEXIM1
are degraded through the process of autophagy in a number
of acute leukemia cell lines [14]. In turn, inhibition of
autophagy substantially increases the expression of
HEXIM1, suggesting that the activation of autophagy confer
sensitivity to BET inhibitors.
Ubenimex (Bestatin) is a low-molecular-weight
dipeptide that enhances the function of immunocompetent
cells and exhibits diverse effects on the production of
cytokines. It shows benefits in glioma treatment by inhibiting
the 5-LO-LTA4 hydrolase pathway [15]. Our previous study
demonstrated its function as an Akt inhibitor and a regulator
of autophagy in RCC and prostate cancer cells [16–18]. In
this study, we have discovered that ubenimex suppresses the
Akt pathway and autophagy in glioma cell lines, resulting
in reduced proteolysis of HEXIM1, increasing HEXIM1
expression and activity. Our results suggest that regulation
of the Akt pathway and autophagy in glioma cells confers
sensitivity to BET inhibitors and provides a synergistic
effect of JQ1 on glioma.

and U251). The cells were treated with JQ1 at varying
concentrations (from 10nM to 5μM) for 72 hours. The
WST-1 assay demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in
the viability of all three cell lines following treatment with
JQ1 (P<0.05, Figure 1B). The IC50 values were 65 nM
for U87M, 480 nM for T98G, and 3010 nM for U251.
After 72 hours of JQ1 treatment, U87M showed the most
sensitivity to JQ1, while U251 showed the least response
to JQ1 treatment.
To investigate the effects of ubenimex on JQ1
sensitivity, we pre-treated the cells with ubenimex (0.5mg/
ml) for 48 hours before treatment with JQ1. The WST-1
assay showed no cytotoxicity due to ubenimex pretreatment alone on these three cell lines (data not show);
however, the data showed an increase in JQ1 sensitivity
(P<0.05, Figure 1A). The IC50 values shifted to 50 nM for
U87M, 235 nM forT98G and 830 nM for U251.
HEXIM1 plays an important role in basal and
ubenimex enhanced JQ1 sensitivity
Our study showed distinct sensitivity to JQ1 in
three different glioma cell lines. As some reports showed,
HEXIM1 expression and activity contribute to BRD4
inhibition; therefore, we tested HEXIM1 expression in
these three types of cells by Western Blot. WB showed
that U87M exhibited the highest HEXIM1 expression,
while U251 exhibited the lowest expression (Figure 1B).
This indicated that HEXIM1 plays an important role in
basal JQ1 sensitivity.
To verify this concept, we down-regulated HEXIM1
expression using HEXIM1 SiRNA in U87M and T98G
(basal HEXIM1 expression in U251 is very low). After
verification using Western blot (Figure 2A), HEXIM1
downregulated cells (Si-HEXIM1), empty vectors (Sicontrol), and control cells were subjected to the WST-1
cell proliferation assay. There is no significant difference
between the control (no treatment) and mock (empty
vector transfected) groups. However, compared to the
control group, both of these cell lines showed less JQ1
sensitivity after knock down of HEXIM1, (P<0.05,
Figure 2B). The IC50 values shifted to 110 nM for U87M
HEXIM1 SiRNA, and 750nM for T98G HEXIM1 SiRNA
(Figure 2C). These results indicated that HEXIM1 plays
an important role in JQ1 sensitivity.
In addition, we tested the ubenimex pre-treated
cells in the same way to identify whether the HEXIM1
knockdown has the same effect on ubenimex-enhanced
JQ1 sensitivity. Generally, all three groups (HEXIM1
SiRNA, empty vector and control cells) were pre-treated
with ubenimex (0.5mg/ml, 48 hours), followed by JQ1
treatment at varying dose (10nM-5uM) for 72 hours.
WST-1 assay showed that downregulating HEXIM1 could
attenuate ubenimex-enhanced JQ1 sensitivity (P<0.05,
Figure 2B). In comparison to ubenimex pre-treated cells,
the IC50 for JQ1HEXIM1 knockdown groups ‘shifted to
70 nM for U87M HEXIM1 SiRNA, and 380 nM for T98G
HEXIM1 SiRNA (Figure 2C).

RESULTS
Ubenimex enhances the sensitivity of JQ1 (BRD4
inhibition)-induced cell death by upregulating
HEXIM1 expression in glioma cells
Ubenimex enhances the sensitivity of JQ1-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis
To investigate the effects of JQ1 on glioma cell
proliferation, we first employed the WST-1 assay to
determine the effects of JQ1on glioma cell lines. Three
cell lines of interest were subject to the test (U87M, T98G

induced apoptosis in U87M cells, the effect was attenuated
by knocking down HEXIM1 which indicated a role of
HEXIM1 on JQ1-induced apoptosis. Ubenimex enhanced
the JQ1 sensitivity of both mock control and HEXIM1
knockdown cells (Figure 3). Acridine orange (AO)/
ethidium bromide (EB) double staining shows the level

knockdown.

through which proteins are targeted for degradation
in autophagocytic vesicles (Figure 5A). Besides, a
reduced count of autophagosomes was observed in the
ubenimex-treated group using the electron microscope
(P<0.01, Figure 6C, 6D), which, therefore, suggested a
decrease in autophagy after ubenimex treatment.
To further verify the presence of autophagy in
regulating HEXIM1 expression and JQ1 sensitivity, the
cells were incubated with pharmacologic autophagy
stimulator Rapamycin (10nm, together with ubenimex
treatment). The data has shown a dramatically decreased
HEXIM1 expression after upregulation of the autophagy
level (Figure 5A). Immunofluorescence staining of
U87M cells was performed to test JQ1 or JQ1 combined
ubenimex treatment on HEXIM1 expression. The
data showed that JQ1 treatment alone had no effect on
HEXIM1 expression, however, in combination with
ubenimex HEXIM1 expression was significantly downregulated (Figure 5B, 5C). Min Huang et al. demonstrated
that HEXIM1 is degraded through the process of
autophagy. Our results are consistent with HEXIM1
autophagic degradation. The WST-1 assay verified that
the effect of ubenimex-improved JQ1 sensitivity was
attenuated (P<0.05, Figure 6A) upon knockdown of
HEXIM1 in glioma cells. Moreover, the KD of HEXIM1

Upregulation of HEXIM1 expression after ubenimex
treatment by suppression of autophagic protein
degradation
We tested the effect of ubenimex on HEXIM1
expression using Western blot; the data pointed to
significant HEXIM1 up-regulation after ubenimex pretreatment in all three cell lines (Figure 5A).
The up-regulation of HEXIM1 by ubenimex
treatment, in conjunction with markedly increased
expression of p62 and decreased LC3B expression,
pointed to the downregulation of autophagy, a process

shifted the IC50 of JQ1 from 50nM to 125nM for U87M,
from 235nM to 505nM for T98G and from 830nM to
4950nM for U251 (Figure 6B). All of the above data
pointed to an important role of autophagy in ubenimexregulated JQ1 sensitivity in glioma cells.

Western blot showed that ubenimex treatment
significantly reduced the concentration of phosphorylated
proteins involved in the Akt signaling pathways (p-Aktser437), (Figure 7C). We designed a test to verify whether
the Akt pathway is involved in JQ1 sensitivity in glioma
cells. The WST-1 assay showed that treatment with an
Akt agonist (10 nM) compromises JQ1 efficacy (P<0.01,
Figure 7A). It also verified that ubenimex improved
JQ1 sensitivity was attenuated after stimulating the Akt
pathway using the Akt agonist (P<0.05, Figure 7A). The
IC50 of JQ1 combined with the Akt agonist treatment
shifted from 50nM to 100nM for U87M; from 235 nM to
510 nM for T98G and from 830nM to 1100nM for U251
(Figure 7B). The Akt agonist attenuated the ubenimexenhanced JQ1 sensitivity suggesting that suppression of
the Akt pathway by ubenimex is involved in JQ1sensitivity
in glioma cells.

The role of the Akt pathway in ubenimexenhanced JQ1 sensitivity and invasion inhibition
in glioma cells
The role of the Akt pathway in ubenimex-enhanced
JQ1 sensitivity
The role of the Akt pathway in JQ1 sensitivity
remains controversial. Cheng’s study indicates higher
Akt expression rescuing c-Myc from JQ1- induced
suppression in glioblastoma, whereas tour his study
indicates the opposite, c-Myc downregulation effects on
Akt downregulation. Cheng’s study also demonstrated
that Akt-upregulation in the genetically engineered cells
did not attenuate JQ1 sensitivity indicating that Akt may
not directly associate with JQ1 resistance [19]. A preclinical analysis conducted by Vishal et al. suggested
that JQ1 treatment could induce Akt suppression only
at longer time intervals, indicating that the Akt pathway
plays a context-depended role in JQ1 treatment of
glioma cells [5].

Combing JQ1 with ubenimex inhibit cell invasion in an
Akt-dependent pathway
The Akt pathway plays an important role in
regulating cell invasion. Our previous study verified that
ubenimex could inhibit RCC cell migration by inhibiting
the Akt pathway. Since one of the potential risks of JQ1
treatment is an aggressive progression of the tumor [5], a
method to reduce glioma cell migration is essential in JQ1
treatment.

Trans-well assays were performed to determine
whether ubenimex affects the migration capacity in glioma
U251 cell lines. The migration capacity of glioma cells
was significantly suppressed by combining ubenimex
with JQ1 (P=0.012). The Akt agonist could significantly
attenuate this effect (P=0.007), pointing to its role in
suppressing glioma cell migration by combining ubenimex
with JQ1 (Figure 8). However, the migration assay showed
that there is no response to JQ1 treatment alone.

could improve JQ1 efficiency in vivo. Consistent with the
in vitro study results, T98G showed a better response to
JQ1 treatment than the U251 xenografts model (P=0.017).
In order to verify whether ubenimex could improve JQ1
sensitivity in less sensitive glioma cells, T98G, the U251
xenografts model was studied in more detail. The data
showed that with ubenimex oral dosage, the volume of
the tumor grew slower or shrunk much faster (P=0.031),
indicating that ubenimex improved the efficiency of JQ1 in
controlling the glioma tumor volume in vivo (Figure 9A).
The tumor tissue from U251 xenografts was subjected
to IHC staining to detect HEXIM1 expression. The data
showed higher HEXIM1 expression in ubenimex-treated
tumor tissues (P=0.015), which was consistent with in

ubenimex or JQ1 treatment could hinder the progression
of glioma, dissection was performed after U251 xenografts
were sacrificed. The metastases to lungs, the liver and

al. evaluated the efficacy of JQ1 against medulloblastoma.
They found that the JQ1 treatment significantly suppressed
cell proliferation by decreasing cMYC activation [20].
Furthermore, Venkataraman’s study demonstrated that
BRD4 inhibition by JQ1 treatment in medulloblastoma
induced apoptosis leading to a significant decrease in
cell proliferation. However, the pre-clinical analysis
showed its limitation by demonstrating that transient
treatment with JQ1 leads to an aggressive development
of the tumor and, therefore, accelerated death [5]. Thus,
an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying
JQ1 is urgently required to design strategies to improve its
efficiency, as well as overcome its limitations.
BRD4 regulates mitotic progression by binding to
transcriptional start sites of genes and directing their postmitotic transcription [21]. JQ1 gets incorporated in place
of BRD4 fusion oncoprotein and inhibits its interaction
with p-TEFb on chromatin, thus inducing cell-cycle arrest
and initiating apoptosis. BRD4 mediates transcriptional
elongation and has been linked to positive transcription
elongation factor complex (P-TEFb)-induced increased
growth promotion [22, 23].

DISCUSSION
Glioma,
including
glioblastoma
(GBM),
medulloblastoma, and oligodendrogliomas, typically
originate in the brain or the spine. The potential of JQ1
in glioma has been reported during the past 10 years.
Cheng found JQ1 induced marked G1 cell-cycle arrest
and apoptosis in heterogeneous GBM as well as in
orthotopic GBM tumors [19]. These studies suggest the
therapeutic potential of JQ1 in GBM treatment. Henssen et

Recent evidence demonstrated a role of HEXIM1
in cancers via regulation of P-TEFb dependent
mechanisms [24, 25]. HEXIM1’s major function is
P-TEFb inhibition [26, 27]. It plays an equilibrium
between the positive regulation by Brd4 and negative
regulation by HEXIM1 of p-TEFb which determines
the extent of BET activation [8, 9, 11, 12]. (Figure
10). Min Huang’s research demonstrated a reduced

sensitivity to JQ1 after degradation of HEXIM1 in a
number of acute leukemia cell lines [14]. Our research
confirmed that HEXIM1 is critical in regulating JQ1
sensitivity in glioma cells. HEXIM1 upregulation
significantly improved JQ1 efficiency in inhibiting
glioma cell lines’ proliferation and cell death.
Previous study showed ubenimex’s benefits
in glioma therapy [15], but its mechanism remains

unclear. According to our previous study, ubenimex can
inhibit the Akt pathway and regulate autophagy in renal
cell carcinoma and prostate cells sensitive to radiotherapy
[16–18]. We tested the effect of autophagy regulation
and Akt inhibition in glioma cells. The data have shown
that ubenimex can downregulate the level of autophagy
and inhibit the Akt pathway. Besides, ubenimex showed
significant potential in improving JQ1 sensitivity in
glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we
also tested whether this effect is associated with the
autophagy suppression or Akt inhibition induced by
ubenimex treatment.
Our study demonstrated that ubenimex treatment
suppresses autophagy in glioma cells. Min Huang's
research demonstrated the activation of autophagy as
the cause of degradation of HEXIM1 in a subset of
acute myelogenous leukemias, and verified its role in the
regulation of HEXIM1 protein stability [14]. Autophagy
activation and the subsequent proteolysis of HEXIM1
result in a shift in the balance between an inactive pTEFbHEXIM1 complex and an active Brd4-pTEFb complex
toward increased efficiency of Brd4 inhibition by JQ1.
Our research show definitive evidence to suggest that
autophagy is central to HEXIM1 degradation in a subset
of glioma cells. The role of autophagy in the regulation of
HEXIM1 protein expression was confirmed by a reversal
of proteolysis, a decrease in LC3B expression, a decrease
in autophagosome formation, and an increase in p62 - a
key receptor of cargo uptake into the autophagosome
vesicle.
The role of the Akt pathway in JQ1 sensitivity
remains controversial. Haifeng Qiu’s research
demonstrated that JQ1 suppresses tumor growth via the
PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in endometrial cancer. This
research demonstrated that JQ1 blocks the PI3K/AKT
pathway and suppress tumor growth. Thus, JQ1 resistance
appears to be highly associated with the status of the Akt
pathway in endometrial cancer [28]. However, Cheng
demonstrated that Akt up-regulation does not attenuate
JQ1 sensitivity, and therefore may suggest a lack of impact
of Akt-activation on JQ1 resistance [19]. HEXIM1 was
found to inhibit the pTEFb kinase activity by sequestering
it in a complex with 7SK snRNA [7, 27], HMBA releases
the P-TEFb from HEXIM1 and 7SK [13] (Figure 10),
indicating a cross-talk between HEXIM1 and the Akt
pathway. Our study showed that treatment with ubenimex
significantly reduced phosphorylated proteins involved
in the Akt signaling pathways (p-Akt-ser437), while
treatment with an Akt agonist compromised JQ1 efficacy,
indicating that the Akt pathway plays an important role in
ubenimex-improved JQ1 sensitivity in glioma.
The Akt pathway also plays an important role in
regulating the invasiveness of cancer cells. Our previous
study demonstrated that ubenimex can suppress cell
migration and invasion in prostate cancer and renal cell
carcinoma cells via Akt inhibition. Vishal Rajagopalan
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

showed that limitation of JQ1 treatment leads to aggressive
tumor development and, therefore, accelerated death [5].
Our research demonstrated that JQ1 could suppress glioma
cell’s migration and invasion ability via downregulation
of the Akt pathway, indicating that this adjuvant treatment
could not only improve JQ1 efficiency but also overcome
its limitation.
In conclusion, our results suggest the existence
of a regulatory role of autophagy based degradation of
HEXIM1 leading to BRD4 inhibition. Our study also
provides a potential explanation for the BET inhibitors’
sensitivity and suggests that the adjuvant treatment with
autophagy inhibitors such as ubenimex to JQ1 may be
better than JQ1 treatment alone in glioma cells. Although
the role of the Akt pathway in regulating JQ1 sensitivity
remains controversial, our study demonstrated that
ubenimex could improve JQ1 efficiency by suppressing
the Akt pathway. Through suppression of the Akt pathway,
the potential of ubenimex adjuvant treatment to attenuate
parts of JQ1’s side effects becomes evident. The potential
of combining JQ1 with autophagy inhibition by ubenimex
has also been confirmed in xenografts model, pointing to
the utility of ubenimex adjuvant treatment in the treatment
of glioma.

were purchased from ATCC (American type culture
collection, USA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in a humidified
incubator containing 5% CO2. All the reagents used
in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.

using a microplate reader (EL340 Bio-Tek Instruments,
Hopkinton, MA, USA).
The IC50 was measured by incubating the cells
with a series of JQ1concentrations in 96-well plates
according to the procedure similar to the WST-8
described below.

incubated with annexin V-FITC/PI in the dark for 15
min. A total of 5,000 cells/sample were analyzed using
an FACSCalibur or an EPICS XL flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The cells in the
early stages of apoptosis stained positive for annexin
V-FITC, whereas those in the late stages of apoptosis
stained positive for both annexin V-FITC and PI.

Parental and respective cells were seeded into
6-well plates and incubated with different concentrations
of drugs. Before lysis, the cells were washed once with
ice-cold PBS. Proteins were extracted from the cells
with a suspension of RIPA buffer, 1% PMSF and 1%
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Cells were scraped off,
collected into eppendorf tubes and incubated on ice
with a lysis buffer mixture for 30 minutes while shaking
the mixture every 5 minutes. Extracted proteins were
then centrifuged at 12,000rpm, and 4°C for 30 minutes
and the supernatants were used for analysis. Protein
concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay
and the BCA protein assay kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China).
Protein (40 μg) was electrophoresed on a pre-cast Bis-Tris
polyacrylamide gel (8% and 12%) and then transferred to
a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blotted with the
following antibodies: rabbit anti-LC3B (1:1,000; Sigma),
rabbit anti-HEXIM1 (1:1,000, sigma, USA), rabbit antiAkt (1:1,000, CST; Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit antipAkt (1:1,000, CST; Danvers, MA, USA), and rabbit
anti-a tubulin (1:1,000, BOSTER, China), followed by
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:5,000; ZB2306 and ZB2301; both from
ZsBio, Beijing, China). Immunoblots were developed by
enhanced chemiluminescence (LAS4000).

Acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB)
double staining
Cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h and
were then treated with different doses of ubenimex for 16
h. After the indicated treatment times, AO/EB operating
fluid was mixed reagent A, reagent B, and reagent C at
a certain rate of 1:1:8. Each sample was added 2ul AO/
EB operating fluid, discarded the supernatant after low
speed centrifugal (500g/min), re-suspend cells in AO/EB
Dilution Buffer at a concentration of 5x10^6 cells/ml, then
add 1ul AO/EB operating fluid to 25ul cell suspension.
Next, the cells were observed under a fluorescence
microscope (Nikon, Inc., Japan).

Electronic microscopy
After incubation, the cells were fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde for 1.5h, postfixed with 1% osmium
tetroxide for 1.5h, dehydrated with increasing ethanol,
embedded and sectioned. Sections were stained with
Uranium Acetate and 0.3% lead citrate and observed on a
JEOL-1200EX electron microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan).

Immunocytochemistry
The coverslips containing fixed cells were washed
two times with wash buffer. Non-specific staining was
blocked by adding blocking buffer and incubating the
cells for 45 minutes at room temperature. Following, the
blocking buffer was removed and the primary antibody
rabbit anti-HEXIM1 (1:300, sigma, USA) was diluted in
dilution buffer. The cells were then incubated overnight at
4°C. The secondary antibody was diluted in dilution buffer
and 400 μL were added to the wells and incubated at room
temperature for 1 hour in the dark. One drop of the antifade mounting medium was dispensed onto the microscope
slide per coverslip. The coverslip was mounted with the
cells facing towards the microscope slide and visualized
using a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS, Japan).

Animal experiments
Five weeks old female nude BALB/c mice were
obtained from VITAL RIVER (Beijing, China). The study
protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of
the Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University
and in line with the guidelines of the Office of Laboratory
Animal Welfare. The experiment schedule was designed
on the basis of preliminary experiments. Approximately
5x106 ACHN/ACHN-R cells were subcutaneously
inoculated into the right flank of mice which was randomly
arranged into five groups of five mice per group. Two
weeks later, the mice were treated on day 0 once daily
by gavage with either vehicle (DMSO), JQ1 (30mg/kg),
JQ1+ ubenimex (20mg/kg) in both parental and resistance
groups. The tumor volumes were estimated every 7 days
using the standard formula: volume = length × width 2/2.
One month later, all mice were sacrificed.

Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/
propidium iodide (PI) staining
Apoptotic cells were quantified (%) using an
annexin V-FITC/PI kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech, Co.
Ltd., Nanjing, China) and detected by flow cytometry.
The cells were harvested after 12h of treatment with
JQ1 alone or in combination with ubenimex. Next, the
cells were resuspended in the binding buffer (10 mmol/l
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid,
140 mmol/l NaCl and 2.5 mmol/l CaCl2, pH 7.4) and

Immunohistochemical staining (IHC)
Tumor tissues from mice were formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded. After rehydration and antigen
retrieval, the slides (thickness = 4 μm) were incubated
