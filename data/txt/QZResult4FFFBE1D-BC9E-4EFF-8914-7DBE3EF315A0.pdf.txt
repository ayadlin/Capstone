Telomerase Inhibition Potentiates the Effects of Genotoxic
Agents in Breast and Colorectal Cancer Cells in a
Cell Cycle–Specific Manner
Raina A. Tamakawa, Helen B. Fleisig, and Judy M.Y. Wong

Abstract
Previous studies have shown that telomerase facilitates DNA-damage repair and cell survival following stress.
It is not clear how telomerase promotes DNA repair, or whether short-term telomerase inhibition, combined
with genotoxic stress, can be exploited for cancer therapy. Here, we show that transient inhibition of telomerase
activity by the specific inhibitor, GRN163L, increases the cytotoxicity of some, but not all, DNA-damaging
agents. Such synergistic inhibition of growth requires the use of DNA-damaging agents that are toxic in the
S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. Notably, inhibition of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase, together with
telomerase inhibition, synergistically increases the cytotoxicity induced by the G2-specific topoisomerase II
inhibitor etoposide. By varying the timing of telomerase inhibition, relative to the timing of DNA damage, it
is apparent that the prosurvival functions of telomerase occur at early stages of DNA damage recognition and
repair. Our results suggest that the protective role of telomerase in cell cycle–restricted DNA damage repair
could be exploited for combined anticancer chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8684–94. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase that
maintains telomeres, nucleoprotein structures that cap the
ends of linear chromosomes. Somatic inhibition of telomerase activity functions as a tumor suppression mechanism
important in long-lived organisms, limiting indefinite proliferation and thus decreasing the likelihood of accumulating
multiple mutations essential for carcinogenesis (1, 2). Surveys
of cancer patient samples established that more than 85% of
human tumors have high telomerase activity, primarily
through transcriptional upregulation of the telomerase
reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene (3). Solid tumors reactivate telomerase in the late initiation phase of tumorigenesis
(4). Accordingly, telomerase activity and in situ hTERT detection have been used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in
tumor pathology studies (5–7).
The prevalence of telomerase activation in human cancers
makes the targeting of telomerase an appealing therapeutic
option. Current rationale for the use of telomerase inhibitors
in anticancer therapies is based on the knowledge that these
agents disrupt telomere length homeostasis in cancer cells,
eventually leading to telomere depletion after a sufficient

lag time (8). Previously, it was shown that faster cancer cell
death resulted from combining other cytotoxic agents with
telomerase inhibition, through chemical inhibitors or genetic
manipulations such as RNA interference, or expression of
dominant-negative hTERT (9, 10). These reports concluded
that telomere attrition is essential for treatment efficacy (9),
but this conclusion may have been influenced by the lag time
required to genetically manipulate and generate stable cell
lines to achieve telomerase inhibition. GRN163L is a thiophosphoamidate oligomer with 13 bases complementing the template region of telomerase RNA. GRN163L competitively
inhibits the binding of the telomerase holoenzyme to its substrate (11, 12). GRN163L-mediated telomerase inhibition has
a synergistic effect when combined with breast cancer treatments such as ionizing radiation (13), and again - these effects
were dependent on telomere length attrition. New studies of
GRN163L with other anticancer agents such as paclitaxel, a
microtubule stabilizer (14), and trastuzumab, a monoclonal
antibody against HER2-positive cancers (15), showed cooperativity between telomerase inhibition and these treatments.
GRN163L treatment in these combination studies was over
longer periods, and the effects of the combinations were evaluated immediately after the cessation of treatment, with cell
viability assays such as the trypan blue exclusion protocol.
The prosurvival functions of telomerase, unrelated to
telomere length maintenance, could contribute to cancer
growth. Matsutomi and colleagues have shown that reduced
endogenous expression of telomerase in primary fibroblasts
abrogates DNA damage repair by changing chromatin architecture and Ataxia Telangiestasia Mutated (ATM) activation
(16). The ability of telomerase to protect against DNA damage may explain the strong preference of telomerase activation over the Alternate Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT)

mechanism in most tumors. Here, we investigate whether
telomerase-positive cancer cells better tolerate the genotoxic
effects of common chemotherapeutic agents with or without
concurrent short-term telomerase inhibition.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 (ATCC no.
HTB-22) and human colorectal carcinoma cell lines HT29
(ATCC no. HTB-38) and LS180 (ATCC no. CL-187) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection at the
commencement of this work. The identities of all three cell lines
were authenticated at the conclusion of experiments (STR
analysis by RADIL service at the University of Missouri in
August 2010). All cell culture media, antibiotics, and other cell
culture reagents are commercially available from Invitrogen/
Life Technologies unless otherwise noted. Etoposide, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich.
Bleomycin and ATM inhibitor KU55933 were obtained from
Calbiochem. GRN163L (Imetelstat) was obtained from Geron,
resuspended in PBS, and the stock concentration was determined before each experiment using UV-spectrophotometer
absorbance.
Telomerase inhibition, DNA damage induction, and
colony-forming unit assays
Prior to DNA damage induction, MCF-7 or HT29 cells
were treated for 24 hours with 10 μmol/L of GRN163L, a
dose determined with a dose–response telomere rapid
amplification protocol (TRAP) experiment described below.
Following treatment, cells were incubated for an additional
24 hours with a 2-fold serial dilution of etoposide (dose
ranges: MCF, 0.025–12.8 μmol/L; HT29, 0.05–12.8 μmol/L),
bleomycin (MCF-7, 0.01–10.24 μg/mL; HT29, 0.02–20.48 μg/
mL), irinotecan (MCF-7, 0.1–102.4 μmol/L; HT29, 0.1–102.4
μmol/L), or oxaliplatin (MCF-7, 0.1–102.4 μmol/L; HT29,
0.1–102.4 μmol/L) in the presence or absence of 10 μmol/L
of GRN163L. Experiments requiring ATM inhibition were
carried out in an identical manner with one modification:
the ATM inhibitor KU55933 was added at a concentration
of 10 μmol/L in combination with the DNA-damaging
agents (17).
The colony-forming unit (CFU) assay was performed essentially as described (16). Cells were incubated for 2 weeks
at 37°C and 5% CO2 to allow single colonies to develop. The
minimum threshold for inclusion required colonies to be >50
μm in diameter. Each combination treatment curve was normalized to its own control group: cells receiving the same
dose of GRN163L or ATM inhibitor KU55933, but no DNAdamaging agent. Each experiment was repeated at least three
times. LD 50 s for each experiment were obtained using
the software GraphPad Prism. Student's t-test was used for
statistical comparison.
Telomerase activity assays
Telomerase activity was measured using whole cell extracts and a modified TRAP assay (18, 19). TRAP activity

www.aacrjournals.org

was measured for each of the combination experiments to
confirm the efficient inhibition of telomerase activity by
GRN163L treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Western blot assays
Whole cell lysate from treated cells was electrophoresed on
SDS-PAGE gel, transferred and subsequently blotted with antibodies against p53 (Cell Signaling) and β-actin (Sigma), as previously described (20). The membranes were immunoblotted
with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibody, followed by ECL Plus (Amersham) for
detection on Kodak X-ray films.
Immunofluorescent analysis
Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and treated with
the same chemotherapeutic regimens described above. At
the conclusion of chemical treatment, cells were fixed in
3.7% paraformaldehyde, solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100
in 1× PBS supplemented with 1% FCS. Fixed cells were immunostained with γH2AX antibodies (Millipore) and Texas
red–labeled secondary antibodies against mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). DNA was counterstained with the nucleic acids
dye Yo-PRO-1 and mounted using Fluoromount G (Southern
Biotech). Immunofluorescent signals were observed with a
Zeiss Pascal confocal microscope, fitted with the appropriate
lasers and filters (UBC BioImaging Centre).

Results
Efficient telomerase inhibition by GRN163L in breast
cancer and colorectal cancer cell models
To achieve efficient short-termed inhibition of telomerase
activity in cultured cancer cell models, we used the specific
telomerase inhibitor, GRN163L (Imetelstat, Geron Corporation). We chose three different cancer cell lines for our experiments: MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line previously reported to
respond well to telomerase inhibition by GRN163L (21), and
HT29 and LS180, two colorectal cell lines that are highly
telomerase-positive, but with different p53 status and microsatellite stabilities (22–24). Cells were cultured with increasing doses of GRN163L for 24 hours. Cell extracts from each
treatment group were assayed for telomerase activity with
the TRAP activity assay.
TRAP profiles showed that a dose of 8 μmol/L of GRN163L
resulted in a 25- to 125-fold inhibition of telomerase activity in
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). Compare the lack of telomere repeat
activity in extracts treated with 8 μmol/L of GRN163L to the
control profiles, in which weak TRAP activity was observed at
125-fold dilution. We found very similar dose–response relationships of GRN163L and TRAP activity in HT29 and LS180
colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 1B and C). Quantitative PCR analysis of mean telomere length in these three cell lines did not
reveal any significant changes with GRN163L treatments for
24 or 48 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1). We concluded that a
24-hour treatment with 10 μmol/L of GRN163L is sufficient to
inhibit telomerase function as assayed with TRAP in all three
cancer cell models.

measures long-term recovery and proliferation of cultured
cells following cytotoxic stress induction.
Using the breast cancer cell model MCF-7, we observed
a significant shift of the dose–response curves for the
S/G2-specific double-stranded DNA-damaging agent etoposide, in the presence of GRN163L. Etoposide induces doublestranded DNA breaks in a S and G2 cell cycle phase–specific
manner (25, 26). The addition of GRN163L reduced the lethal
dose of etoposide by 2.8-fold, significant at P = 0.005 (unpaired
t-tests, GraphPad Prism; Fig. 2A). The parallel shift of the

dose–response curves suggests a conserved cytotoxic mechanism. Next, we measured the LD50 of etoposide in the colorectal cancer cell line HT29. Consistent with our observations in
MCF-7 cells, the addition of GRN163L telomerase inhibition
significantly increased the cytotoxicity of etoposide in HT29
cells (Fig. 2B). Adding telomerase inhibition reduced the
lethal dose of etoposide by 2.5-fold in HT29 colorectal cancer
cells, significant at P = 0.006.
To corroborate this observation, we combined telomerase
inhibition with another cell cycle–dependent DNA-damaging

agent. Irinotecan is converted to its active metabolite SN-38
by intracellular hydrolysis, resulting in the inhibition of
topoisomerase I. Inhibition of topoisomerase I by these compounds results in the generation of DNA nicks in replicationand transcription-active cells (27). These ssDNA nicks are
converted into double-strand breaks by DNA replication machinery as they pass through the unrepaired loci during the
DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle (28). Coadministration
of irinotecan with telomerase inhibitor GRN163L in breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 resulted in increased cytotoxicity of
the DNA-damaging agent (Fig. 2C). The addition of telomerase inhibitor reduced the lethal dose of irinotecan in
MCF-7 cells by 2.1-fold, significant at P = 0.02. A similar increase in the cytotoxicity of irinotecan by the coadministration of telomerase inhibitor GRN163L was observed in the
colorectal cell line HT29 (Fig. 2D). We observed a 1.7-fold
increase in the cytotoxicity of irinotecan in HT29 cells concurrently treated with the telomerase inhibitor GRN163L.
This difference in LD50 is significant at P = 0.02. Notably,
the combination of irinotecan with GRN163L is less effective
than etoposide with GRN163L.
These experiments indicate that telomerase activity conferred a survival advantage in DNA-damaged human cancer
cells. Transient loss of telomerase activity induced by a specific enzyme inhibitor is sufficient to reverse this protection.
Administration of telomerase inhibition at the time of
DNA-damage induction resulted in synergistic increases of
cytotoxicity.
Telomerase inhibition by GRN163L has no effects
on the cytotoxicity of cell cycle nonspecific
DNA-damaging agents
Telomerase activity in human cells is regulated in a manner that is specific to the cell cycle (19, 29, 30). Because both
etoposide and irinotecan are cytotoxic at the S and G2 phases
of the cell cycle, we next tested whether the synergy between
telomerase inhibition and DNA-damaging agents was dependent on cell cycle timing of the genotoxic agent action.
We treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the doublestranded DNA-damaging agent bleomycin. Bleomycin's cytotoxicity is attributed to its ability to cleave nucleic acids,
leaving lesions that are difficult to repair (31). Bleomycin
cytotoxicity is not cell cycle–dependent, although actively
cycling cells exhibit increased sensitivity to bleomycin treatment. Unlike cell cycle stage–specific DNA-damaging agents,
MCF-7 cells did not exhibit any increased sensitivity to bleomycin in the presence of telomerase inhibitor GRN163L
(Fig. 3A, P = 0.90). In parallel, the addition of GRN163L slightly increased the cytotoxicity of bleomycin in the colorectal
cancer cell line HT29 by 1.2-fold (Fig. 3B). However, this small
difference in LD50 was not statistically significant for our assay
variables (P = 0.28).
We next tested the effect of oxaliplatin, another cell cycle
stage–nonspecific DNA-damaging agent. Oxaliplatin is a
platinum-containing alkylating agent that forms direct crosslinks with DNA by attacking nucleophilic sites on the base,
with cytotoxicity correlated to the number of interstrand
crosslinks, leading to double-stranded DNA breaks (32). In

www.aacrjournals.org

agreement with our observations of the other non–cell
cycle–specific DNA-damaging agent bleomycin, combining
oxaliplatin with GRN163L did not result in an increase in
its cytotoxicity (Fig. 3C, P = 0.76). This observation was corroborated in the colorectal cell line HT29 (Fig. 3D). Paradoxically, the addition of telomerase inhibitor showed a small
protective effect against oxaliplatin cytotoxicity, but this
difference was not statistically significant for our assay
variables (P = 0.29).
Coadministration of GRN163L and DNA-damaging agents
with broad genotoxicity induction timing did not show the
same potentiation seen with the previous combination treatments. Adding telomerase inhibitor to these cell cycle nonspecific DNA-damaging agents caused no increase in
cytotoxicity. We concluded that concurrent telomerase inhibition only benefits a select group of DNA-damaging agents
that have a defined window of cytotoxic activity within the
cell cycle.
GRN163L telomerase inhibition and ATM inhibition
synergistically increase the cytotoxicity of cell
cycle–specific DNA-damaging agents
Our data showed that telomerase activity protects against
the cytotoxicity of double-stranded DNA-damaging agents
active in S/G2 of the cell cycle. Telomerase inhibition in primary human fibroblasts by small hairpin RNA targeting
hTERT was associated with a loss of ATM kinase activity.
As a result, there is a significant loss of phosphorylation of
ATM targets following the induction of DNA damage when
compared with telomerase-positive cells (16). Because the
ATM-mediated homologous recombination DNA repair
mechanism is particularly important at S/G2 phases of the
cell cycle, we subsequently tested the influence of combining
GRN163L and ATM inhibition on DNA damage–induced
cytotoxicity.
We tested three cancer cell lines with concurrent administration of specific ATM inhibitor KU55933, with GRN163L,
and S/G2-specific double-stranded DNA damage inducer etoposide. ATM inhibition was confirmed with the loss of phosphorylation of ATM targets p53 and γH2AX, normally
evident following the induction of double stranded DNA
damage (Fig. 4, insets; Supplementary Fig. S3). Treatment
with KU55933 or GRN163L separately, in combination with
etoposide, increased the cytotoxicity of the DNA-damaging
agent in MCF-7 cells compared with the cells treated with
topoisomerase II inhibitor alone (P = 0.001 and 0.007, respectively; Fig. 4A). Combining three therapeutic agents together
reduced the lethal dose of etoposide even further (P = 0.0004;
Fig. 4A). The increased cytotoxicity of the triple combination,
compared with the GRN163L/etoposide and KU55933/etoposide double combinations, suggest that telomerase and ATM
inhibition have an additive effect, and that inhibiting these
two prospectively related pathways did not result in the
diminished therapeutic efficiency of either agent.
We repeated this triple-agent treatment with the colorectal cell lines HT29 and LS180. The addition of specific ATM
inhibitor KU55933 or GRN163L to etoposide increased the
cytotoxicity of the DNA-damaging agent in both colorectal

Figure 4. Addition of ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933 further increased the cytotoxicity of etoposide and GRN163L combinations in (A) MCF-7 cells. To confirm
that ATM inhibition by KU55933 was effective, we examined the stability of p53 following DNA damage induction. Corresponding bar graphs showed the

cancer cell lines compared with cells treated with etoposide
alone (Fig. 4B and C). Combining three therapeutic agents
together further reduced the lethal dose of etoposide in
HT29 cells and LS180 cells, significant at P = 0.007 and
P < 0.001, respectively (Fig. 4B and C).
Timing of GRN163L inhibition of telomerase activity
affects its potentiation of the G2-specific
DNA-damaging agent etoposide
To further probe how telomerase inhibition potentiates
the cytotoxicity of etoposide, we performed order-of-addition
experiments. We compared MCF-7 breast cancer cells in four
treatment groups. One group received etoposide alone, and
the other three groups received etoposide doses with
GRN163L, respectively, administered 24 hours before,

www.aacrjournals.org

concurrent with or 4.5 hours after the introduction of the
G2-specific DNA-damaging agent.
The order-of-addition experiments illustrated that the
pretreatment of cells with GRN163L is required for optimal
synergy with etoposide. Pretreatment with GRN163L for 24
hours before the onset of DNA damage substantially reduced
the viability of MCF-7 cells (P = 0.0008; Fig. 5). The addition
of GRN163L concurrently with and after the introduction of
etoposide resulted in lethal doses of the DNA-damaging
agent only slightly different from that of the cells receiving
etoposide alone (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively; Fig. 5), indicating that addition of GRN163L concurrently or after the induction of DNA damage minimally potentiates the effects of
etoposide. These findings suggest that telomerase must be
effectively inhibited by the time DNA damage is induced,

for optimal potentiation of cytotoxicity. This experiment also
showed that decreased CFU growth in GRN163L treatment is
not likely due to posttreatment effects of residual intracellular GRN163L. Otherwise, all three groups receiving GRN163L
would show similar post-treatment effects.

Discussion
High telomerase activity is consistently observed in primary breast and colon cancer samples (3, 33, 34). In addition
to its canonical role of providing telomere length maintenance and the associated proliferative immortality, we and
others have proposed that high telomerase activity confers
an additional growth advantage to cancer cells by promoting
survival in the presence of cellular stresses (reviewed in refs.
35 and 36). A prior report, using short hairpin RNA knockdown of telomerase expression in primary fibroblasts (16),
provided us with the impetus to inhibit this prosurvival function of telomerase in cancer cells as an additional anticancer
therapeutic application for telomerase inhibition. Unlike
long-term telomerase inhibition for the goal of telomere
attrition, telomerase inhibition to reduce cell survival in
conditions of DNA damage could be used as a short-term
therapeutic application.
Short-term, concurrent administration of the telomerase
inhibitor, GRN163L, sensitized breast and colorectal cancer
cells to the cytotoxic effects of cell cycle stage–specific DNAdamaging agents, but it showed minimal potentiation of other
non–cell cycle stage–specific agents. It remains possible that
GRN163L administration could contribute to the cytotoxic
mechanism of most DNA-damaging agents, including the
bleomycins and platinum compounds under some conditions.
However, the potentiation effect of concurrent GRN163L administration seems to be confined to the subpopulation of
cells in S/G2 phase, thereby reducing the contribution of this
mechanism's effect on the overall cytotoxicity of non–cell
cycle–specific DNA-damaging agents. The small contribution
of increased cytotoxicity in S/G2 cells may not be sufficient to
increase cytotoxicity in the overall cell population. Although
off-target effects have been reported with therapeutic oligonucleotides (37), GRN163L treatment in telomerase-negative human cells, and mismatched control oligomer in cancer cells,
produced minimal toxicities (38, 39). Accordingly, we did not
detect any significant loss of CFU growth in the three cancer
cell models treated with short-term GRN163L, either alone or
in combination with non–cell cycle–specific genotoxic agents.
GRN163L is currently in multiple phase I and phase II clinical
trials in patients with breast cancer to assess its efficacy and
toxicity (12).
Based on our drug order-of-addition studies, telomerase
inhibition at the time of genotoxic stimulus is essential for
the optimal cytotoxic potentiation of the DNA-damaging
agent etoposide. We found that the concurrent addition of
telomerase inhibitor GRN163L, or the addition 4.5 hours after
the introduction of etoposide, showed a much smaller
potentiation of the DNA-damaging agent than that observed
with cells receiving GRN163L pretreatment. This observation

nition and/or early repair events. Considering the mechanism of etoposide action, we put forward that in a
nonsynchronized population of MCF-7 cells, only a fraction
of cells would be in G2 at the time of etoposide administration. The delay for cells to reach G2, and hence etoposide toxicity, increases the time for GRN163L to fully inhibit
telomerase actions, before the onset of cytotoxicities.
The addition of ATM inhibitor KU55933 to GRN163L/
etoposide combination treatment increased cytotoxicity further, as observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A previous
model proposed that telomerase acts upstream from ATM activation and that telomerase inhibition prevents ATM activation through the structural regulation of chromatin (16). Our
data suggest the possibility that ATM and telomerase work
independently and augment each other in the DNA damage
repair process, because inhibiting ATM and telomerase activity together provided an additive effect on cytotoxicity. Alternately, this synergy could also reflect combined partial
inhibition of two steps in the same pathway. The synergy of
ATM and telomerase inhibition to increase the cytotoxic
effects of etoposide observed in MCF-7 cells was also observed
in LS180 colorectal cancer cells, but not in HT29 colorectal
cancer cells. Comparison of LS180 and HT29 revealed two notable differences. First, LS180 cells are microsatellite unstable,
with defects in the mismatch repair mechanism, whereas
HT29 cells exhibit normal microsatellite stability, indicating
that their mismatch repair is functional (23). Second, whereas
LS180 cells preserve wild-type p53 function, HT29 cells are reported to express a DNA-binding deficient form of p53 (R273H;
refs. 22, 40). This dominant-negative form of p53 reduces wildtype p53 binding to its cognate DNA binding sites and results
in the loss of tumor suppression activities. Future studies will
be required to determine if these differences underlie the disparity in the role of active telomerase in cell survival following
DNA damage.
Although our data suggests that telomerase provides survival advantages to counter S/G2-specific DNA damage, in a
manner unrelated to telomere length, the actions of telomerase at telomeres may play a significant role in this protective
mechanism. Extremely short telomeres known as T-stumps
occur with low frequency in transformed cells and cancer
cells (41). T-stumps are protected by TERT and the abundance of these structures may be manipulated by changing
TERT levels (41, 42). Transient inhibition of telomerase by
GRN163L could potentially destabilize T-stumps and activate
DNA damage response pathways, in S/G2, coinciding with the
time of telomere synthesis. In addition, recent data showed
that both the ATR and ATM DNA damage signal pathways
are involved in normal DNA replication through telomeres.
Coordinated activation of these two kinases was proposed
for a two-phase model of telomere structural resolution
and reformation during S/G2 of the cell cycle (43, 44). Inhibition of telomerase could prolong this DNA damage signal
activation at the telomeres, specific to S/G2. Additional DNA
damage induced at this time could result in the observed increase in cell death. Finally, topoisomerase IIα is implicated
in the resolution of replication-related topology strains at
the telomeres. There is an inverse relation between the

Telomerase Inhibition and DNA Damage Survival

requirement for topoisomerase action and available TRF2,
with its associated nuclease Apollo at the telomeres (45). It
is conceivable that transient inhibition of telomerase by
GRN163L could induce kinetic or structural changes at telomeres, tipping the balance towards reliance on topoisomerase activities. This could explain the synergistic induction
of cytotoxicity with combined topoisomerase IIα inhibition
and telomerase inhibition.
In previous studies, synergies between GRN163L and various anticancer treatments such as ionizing radiation, microtubule inhibition, and inhibition of oncogenic signals (HER2)
were considered to be dependent on longer-term changes associated with telomere length (13) and chromatin status (14).
Our experiments were designed to examine whether telomerase actions other than the long-term maintenance of
telomere length and chromatin structure may play an important role in response to genotoxic stimuli. Our data imply
that this is indeed the case, and that the contribution of telomerase occurs in a manner that is cell cycle stage–specific:
telomerase activity can increase cell survival by mitigating
the deleterious effect of genotoxic agents predominantly active in G2 phase of the cell cycle. This is the first mechanismbased study combining telomerase inhibition and genotoxic
agents in colorectal cancer cell models. Our data shows that
when DNA damage is induced in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle,

telomerase inhibition increases the cytotoxicity of a genotoxic stimulus. These findings encourage the design of new
chemotherapeutic regimens to exploit the prosurvival function of active telomerase.
