BACKGROUND. In a randomized, phase 3 trial, sunitinib demonstrated superior efficacy over interferon-alfa as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic clearcell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). On the basis of outcome data from that trial, the
authors developed a nomogram for predicting the probability of 12-month progression-free survival for patients who received sunitinib therapy.

METHODS. Three-hundred seventy-five patients who received sunitinib in the
phase 3 trial were the subject of the current analysis. Nomogram pretreatment
predictor variables included corrected serum calcium levels, the number of metastatic sites, hemoglobin levels, prior nephrectomy, the presence of lung and liver

status, time from diagnosis to treatment, and serum levels of alkaline phosphawas the predicted outcome endpoint. Internal validation of the nomogram consisted of quantification of the discrimination with the concordance index and
assessment of calibration.

RESULTS. One-hundred seventy-four of 375 patients (46%) who received sunitinib
achieved an objective response, and the median progression-free survival was
10.8 months (95% confidence interval, 10.6-12.6 months). A nomogram for predicting the probability of 12-month progression-free survival for patients who
received sunitinib therapy was constructed on the basis of a Cox regression
model from 11 parameters that were determined before treatment. The concordance index was 0.633.

CONCLUSIONS. A nomogram was developed from pretreatment clinical features to
predict the probability of achieving 12-month progression-free survival with sunitinib therapy for metastatic clear-cell RCC. The authors concluded that independent validation of the nomogram and additional studies to identify tumorspecific prognostic factors are warranted.

First-line mRCC Nomogram for Sunitinib/Motzer et al

S

unitinib malate (SUTENT; Pfizer, New York, NY)
is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptors.1 Its inhibitory
profile provided the rationale for its study as an antiangiogenesis targeted therapy for clear-cell renal cell
carcinoma (RCC).2,3 Objective response rates of 40%
were observed with sunitinib as second-line treatment in patients with cytokine-refractory, metastatic
RCC.4,5 The high response rate led to the conduct of
a randomized phase 3 trial comparing sunitinib with
interferon-alfa (IFN-a) as first-line, systemic therapy.
The results of a preplanned interim analysis showed
statistically significant improvements in progressionfree survival and objective response rates with sunitinib compared with IFN-a.6 As a result of this trial,
sunitinib is a new reference standard for the first-line
treatment of metastatic RCC.
Prognostic factors are used in clinical trial design
and interpretation, risk-directed treatment, and
patient counseling. Pretreatment features predictive
of survival in patients with metastatic RCC were
examined previously, and the predictive models that
were developed have been applied to the conduct of
clinical trials.7-11 One model, which was developed at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC),
groups patients into categories (favorable, intermediate, and poor) according to the number of risk factors predictive of a short survival.7 The risk factors
are: time <1 year from diagnosis to the start of systemic therapy, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and
corrected serum calcium levels, anemia, and low performance status (PS).7 This model was validated independently by investigators at the Cleveland
Clinic12 and has been used in phase 3 trial design
and interpretation of the new, targeted agents.6,10,13
The MSKCC model defines risk categories, or
groupings of patients, according to predicted outcome.7 It was developed with and comprised of
patients who were treated with cytokines or chemotherapeutic agents, and the outcome assessed
was overall survival. Because molecularly targeted
therapy has replaced outpatient cytokine therapy in
the first-line treatment of metastatic RCC, there is a
need to reassess clinical and biologic features that
are predictive of outcome. Moreover, with the identification of multiple agents now available for RCC,
including temsirolimus,13 bevacizumab,14 and sorafenib,10 the development of tools that individualize
patient prognostication may be helpful in directing
individualized therapy.
After an update of the reported efficacy data
from the randomized phase 3 trial,15 we performed
an analysis of patients who were treated on the suni-

1553

tinib arm of this trial to investigate the correlation
between pretreatment clinical features and progression-free survival. As a result of this analysis, a predictive model, or nomogram, was developed that
predicted the probability of achieving 12-month progression-free survival with sunitinib as first-line
treatment for metastatic clear-cell RCC. Nomograms
have been developed and validated for use in numerous malignant diseases, including prostate cancer
and soft tissue sarcoma,16,17 as well as localized RCC
for use in predicting disease recurrence after nephrectomy.18 To our knowledge, to date, this is the
first nomogram that has been developed specifically
to predict the outcome of systemic therapy for metastatic clear-cell RCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The patient population for this analysis was comprised of 375 patients with metastatic RCC who were
treated with sunitinib in the randomized phase 3
trial.6 The eligibility, methods, treatment plan (1:1
randomization of sunitinib or IFN-a), and outcome
for this phase 3 trial have been reported previously.6
Key eligibility criteria included metastatic RCC with a
clear-cell component, measurable disease, no prior
systemic therapy, adequate PS and organ function,
and signed informed consent. Sunitinib was administered orally in repeated 6-week cycles at 50 mg daily
for 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off
treatment (Schedule 4/2). Response and progressionfree survival outcome data for this analysis were
updated from the published report6 using a data cutoff of February 2007. The study was approved by the
institutional review board or ethics committee at
each participating center. All patients provided written informed consent.
The primary endpoint for this analysis of prognostic factors to sunitinib therapy was investigatorassessed progression-free survival. This endpoint was
defined as the time from randomization to the sunitinib arm of the trial to the first documentation of
disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. The time to progression-free
event was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method.19 A multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression model was the basis of the nomogram.
Points for variables in the nomogram were determined by their Cox model coefficients. The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was
verified by tests of correlation with time. The variables that we used in the nomogram were selected
on the basis of knowledge of their prognostic significance from previous reports and were examined as

either categorical or continuous variables.7-9,11,12,20
The following baseline variables were examined: corrected serum calcium levels, the number of metastatic sites, hemoglobin levels (greater than or equal
to the lower limit of normal [LLN] vs <LLN), prior
nephrectomy, the presence of lung and liver metastases, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
PS of 0 versus 1, thrombocytosis (defined as a platelet count >400,000/lL), time from diagnosis to treatment, and the ratios of the serum levels of both
alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase to
the upper limits of normal for each. No other variables were assessed. Dose reductions or interruptions
were not accounted for in the construction of the
nomogram.
All decisions with respect to the categorization of
variables were made before modeling. Continuous
variables were modeled using restricted cubic splines
to accommodate potentially nonlinear effects.21 No
variables were omitted for a lack of statistical significance in either univariate or multivariate analysis
because of the deleterious effect this would have on
predictive accuracy.21
Nomogram validation comprised 2 activities.
First, discrimination was quantified with the concordance index.22 Similar to the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, but appropriate
for censored data, the concordance index provides
the probability that, in a randomly selected pair of
patients in which 1 patient experiences an event (disease progression or death, whichever is first) before
the other, the patient who experiences an event had
the worse predicted outcome from the nomogram.
We used bootstrapping with 200 resamples to obtain
a relatively unbiased estimate.
Second, calibration was assessed. This was done
by plotting the mean nomogram-predicted progression-free survival probabilities versus the observed
Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression-free survival.
Again, bootstrapping was used. All analyses were performed using S-plus 2000 Professional software (Statistical Sciences, Seattle, Wash) with the Design and
Hmisc libraries added.23

RESULTS
Descriptive statistics for the baseline pretreatment
patient features studied are described in Table 1. All
patients were treated with sunitinib, and the median
duration of treatment was 11 months (range, from
<1 month to 31 months). In total, 101 patients (27%)
were ongoing on sunitinib treatment at the time of
data cutoff for this analysis. The reasons for discontinuation in the remaining patients were progressive

objective response (169 partial responses and 5 complete responses). The best response among the
remaining patients was stable disease (n 5 152
patients; 41%) and progressive disease or not evaluable (n 5 49 patients; 13%). The median progression-free survival was 10.8 months (95% confidence
interval, 10.6-12.6 months) (Fig. 1).
In the Cox model, corrected serum calcium
levels (P 5 .01), the number of metastatic sites
(P < .01), the presence of hepatic metastases (P 5 .03),
thrombocytosis (P < .01), serum lactate dehydrogenase levels (P < .01), and the time from diagnosis to
treatment (P < .01) were associated with progressionfree survival; whereas hemoglobin levels (LLN vs
<LLN; P 5 .82), prior nephrectomy (P 5 .37), ECOG
PS (0 vs 1; P 5 .22), the presence of lung metastases
(P 5 .74), and serum alkaline phosphatase levels
(P 5 .82) were not associated with progression-free
survival. A nomogram for predicting the probability
of 12-month progression-free survival with sunitinib
therapy was constructed from the 11 parameters that
were determined before treatment (Fig. 2).
Statistically insignificant variables were not omitted from the model because of the resultant bias on
the remaining predictors and the subsequent deleterious effect on predictive accuracy.21 The concordance index for the model was 0.633. Figure 3
illustrates the calibration of the nomogram, which
appears to be accurate.
Figure 4 provides examples of calculations using
our nomogram for 2 patients in which very different
prognoses are represented. For the first patient (Fig. 4a),

DISCUSSION
The result of the randomized phase 3 trial comparing
sunitinib with IFN-a established sunitinib as a new,
standard, first-line treatment for metastatic clear-cell
RCC.6 By using updated outcome data from this trial,
we developed and internally validated a nomogram
for predicting the probability of 12-month progression-free survival for sunitinib as first-line therapy.
An advantage of the nomogram is that it may provide a more individualized prognostication than
models that categorize patients into risk groups.
Over the course of the past few years, there has
been a shift in the medical management of patients
with metastatic RCC from cytokines to agents that
target the inhibition of proangiogenic growth factor

activity. Favorable results of phase 3 trials with sunitinib and several other agents, including bevacizumab in combination with IFN-a (first-line therapy),14
temsirolimus (first-line
therapy in poor-risk
patients),13 and sorafenib (as second-line therapy),10
have resulted in a new treatment paradigm for the
management of metastatic RCC.25 Moreover, with the
identification of multiple targeted agents that have
demonstrated benefit, now, there may be an opportunity to individualize patient treatment and to study
the combination and sequencing of these new targeted agents.
In the setting of multiple treatment options,
improving the accuracy of current prognostic estimates
is important for making treatment recommendations
in metastatic RCC. Issues, including efficacy, patient
quality of life, and other ancillary effects of treatment,
influence clinical decision-making, requiring that physicians more accurately assess the risk versus benefit
of treatment. In response to this need, the nomogram
described in this report is a tool that was developed
specifically to predict patient outcome after treatment
with sunitinib, a targeted agent that has demonstrated
efficacy against metastatic clear-cell RCC.
Consistent with the development of nomograms
for other malignancies, we included a wide variety of
clinical features to develop a model that best represented the patients’ baseline clinical features. The
pretreatment factors that have the greatest influence
on this nomogram’s predictions are elevated lactate
dehydrogenase levels, corrected serum calcium
levels, the number of metastatic sites, and the time
from diagnosis to treatment. These clinical features
had previously demonstrated prognostic value in the
earlier models comprised of patients who were treated with cytokines or cytotoxics.7,12
Like any multivariate analysis in which multiple
predictors are undergoing simultaneous adjustment,
interpretations can be difficult or counterintuitive.
From the nomogram, it may appear that a prior nephrectomy contributes to a poor outcome, in that
patients who underwent prior nephrectomy appear
to have a lower prediction of 12-month progressionfree survival. Only 10% of patients in the study did
not undergo prior nephrectomy, and, as may be
expected, the progression-free survival outcome was
more favorable for patients with prior nephrectomy
according to the univariate analysis (median progression-free survival: 11 months vs 6 months with vs
without prior nephrectomy, respectively; P 5 .09).
The important point to remember when interpreting
this axis of the nomogram is that other factors in the
nomogram are being considered. In reality, it is artificial to vary a patient on 1 axis, holding all others

First-line mRCC Nomogram for Sunitinib/Motzer et al

constant (eg, sliding a patient from ‘No’ to ‘Yes’ on
the Prior nephrectomy axis), because it is likely that
he also will move on other axes. Thus, a patient who
underwent prior nephrectomy may have other favorable characteristics, which could result in a prognosis
better than that of the typical patient who has not
undergone prior nephrectomy. Most important,
based on the data from which it was created, this
nomogram would be applied to patients at the time
of evaluation for sunitinib therapy, which would
occur after the completion of standard diagnostic
testing and appropriate surgical management.
The next step in developing this nomogram is to
assess external validation, as has been done with
similar nomograms constructed for other diseases.
This assessment will require the use of a similar
patient cohort treated with sunitinib. One clinical
trial that may be used to provide such a patient database is a randomized phase 2 trial of nearly 300
patients comparing sunitinib administered either on
a continuous dosing regimen at 37.5 mg per day versus Schedule 4/2 at 50 mg per day in treatment-naive patients with metastatic clear-cell RCC.26 The
nomogram was developed through analysis of a
dataset comprised of patients who meet eligibility
criteria for a phase 3 trial.
We recognize the limitation of predictive criteria
based on pretreatment clinical features. Responses to
targeted therapy for other malignancies with agents
like gefitinib and imatinib mesylate have been linked
to specific mutations in the tumors.27,28 The identification of tumor-specific, predictive-specific features
for sunitinib and other targeted therapies in metastatic RCC would be of great value and currently is
being pursued.29
In conclusion, we have developed an internally
validated nomogram for predicting the probability of
12-month progression-free survival with sunitinib. To
our knowledge, it is the first such tool for use with
systemic therapy in metastatic clear-cell RCC. With
the identification of multiple targeted agents for metastatic RCC, the development of tools that individualize
patient prognostication may be helpful for counseling
patients, planning follow-up, and directing therapy.
The nomogram would be applied to patients at the
time of evaluation for sunitinib therapy, after the
completion of standard diagnostic testing and appropriate surgical management. Independent validation
of the nomogram and additional studies to identify
tumor-specific prognostic factors are warranted.
