ABSTRACT:
One of the concerns in targeted drug therapy is that the inhibition of receptors
and signaling molecules in tumor cells may also affect similar components in the
tumor microenvironment or in the immune system, with undefined consequences
for inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, in addition to its antitumor activity in mice
and humans, the Ras inhibitor salirasib (S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid, FTS) also
exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. Here we show three antitumor effects of FTS
in immune-competent mice with subcutaneous or intracranial tumors. First, FTS
exhibited antitumor activity in immune-competent, intracranial tumor-bearing mice
and increased their survival relative to tumor-bearing immune-compromised mice.
Second, FTS induced an increase in regulatory T cells in mouse splenocytes, but
the inhibitory effects of FTS on tumor growth were not affected by these Foxp3+
T lymphocytes. Third, FTS increased antitumor T-cell reactivity by downregulating
Foxp3. This caused TGF-β-dependent sensitization of the tumor to the immune system.

INTRODUCTION

Ras (H-, K-, and N-Ras) and attenuated Ras signaling
and Ras-dependent cell and tumor growth in animal
studies [13-14]. In recent clinical trials (phases I and II)
in patients with pancreatic or nonsmall cell lung cancer,
FTS exhibited marked efficacy with limited toxicity
(http://www.concordiapharma.com). Although Foxp3 was
thought to be unique marker for Tregs [2], it was found to
be expressed also by nonlymphocytic nonhematopoietic
cells and by cancer cells [15-16]. Foxp3 expression has
been demonstrated in breast cancer cells, melanoma cells,
virally transformed B cells, and in cells derived from a
variety of solid tumors [15-18]. The effects of FTSinduced Ras inhibition on Foxp3 expression in tumor cells
and its influence on their growth are not known. Our main
objective in the present work was to examine these effects.
Although Foxp3+ Tregs have been found to have
positive effects in autoimmune diseases (inhibition of
T effector cells and attenuation of the disease), their
accumulation in tumors is associated with unfavorable
clinical prognosis [19]. Foxp3+ Tregs in tumors inhibit
activation of the antitumor immune response. Moreover,
depletion of Foxp3+ Tregs results in activation of CD8+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and enhances their
infiltration into tumors [19]. These effects are accompanied

Foxp3, a transcription factor mainly expressed in
CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) [1], plays a major
role in maintaining homeostasis in immune regulation
by inhibiting the proliferation of effector T cells, thereby
maintaining tolerance and preventing development of
autoimmune diseases [2]. Recently we showed that
expression of Foxp3 in T lymphocytes is negatively
controlled by Ras [3-5]. Accordingly, Ras inhibition in
lymphocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, induces an increase
in Foxp3 expression in T cells [3-4]. In line with these
findings, the Ras inhibitor salirasib (FTS) increases the
number and function of Foxp3+ Tregs and consequently
attenuates the progression of autoimmune diseases in
experimental autoimmune encephalitis, an animal model
for multiple sclerosis [6-7], and in type 1 diabetes [4, 8].
These results supported earlier findings showing effects
of Ras inhibitors in autoimkmune diseases, including
experimental autoimmune neuritis (an animal model for
Guillain-Barré), the MRL/lpr mouse model for lupus,
and experimental antiphospholipid syndrome in mice
[9-12]. Notably, FTS inhibited all isoforms of active

by complete regression of tumors [20-21]. Thus, the two
major functional characteristics of FTS, inhibition of
tumor growth and attenuation of autoimmunity, seem
potentially to pose a therapeutic dilemma. On the one hand
FTS inhibits cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth
[23, 24]; on the other hand it upregulates Foxp3+ Tregs
[3, 4, 5], thereby attenuating autoimmune disease but
inhibiting the antitumor activity of CTLs [22].
Our working hypothesis in the present study was
that the functions of Ras in autoimmune diseases differ
from its functions in cancer. We postulate that in cancer
FTS has a dual effect: it causes a unique Treg-mediated
immune response, which has a favorable effect on tumor
cells while at the same time attenuating tumor-cell growth.
To test our hypothesis, we examined the effect of FTS on
tumor growth in immune-compromised and immunecompetent mice. According to our hypothesis, we expected
to find stronger antitumor activity of FTS in the immunecompetent mice owing to the presence of immune cells in
these mice.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the commonest and
most aggressive neoplasms among human primary brain
tumors [25-26]. Using the mouse glioma cell line GL261
[27], we examined the growth of these cells in syngeneic
C57bl/6 immune-competent mice (host) and nude mice.
Our results showed that FTS treatment significantly
inhibited tumor growth when these GBM cells were
implanted either subcutaneously (s.c.) or intracranially
into the immune-competent C57bl/6 mice. Thus, in mice
with intracranial tumors, FTS not only decreased tumor
size but also prolonged survival. In tumor-bearing nude
mice, however, the life span of animals treated with FTS
did not differ from those that remained untreated. In line
with our hypothesis, FTS reduced the expression of Foxp3
in tumor cells. This reduction may have altered the tumor
microenvironment by enhancing the antitumor immune
response. These results point to the intriguing possibility
of a mechanism in which Ras inhibition reduces resistance
of tumors to immune-mediated protection. These novel
findings also provide strong support for the treatment of

examined by western blotting and FACS, as described in
Methods. Figure 2A shows the changes in tumor volumes
as a function of time. Compared with the control, tumor
volume in the FTS-treated immune-competent mice
was significantly inhibited (by 69%±5%; Figure 2A).
Tumor weight in the FTS-treated mice was decreased by
47.8%±3.8% relative to controls (Figure 2B).
The in-vivo results of biochemical analyses of
K-Ras-GTP, P-Erk, and P-Akt in the excised tumors were
similar to those obtained in vitro, i.e., their levels were
significantly decreased (by 47.06%±3.9%, 26.74%±7.05%,
and 24.45%±5.03%, respectively; Figure 2C). Foxp3
levels in these glioma cells were also significantly
decreased (by 31.88%). However, Foxp3 levels in the
splenocytes of the same tumor-bearing FTS-treated mice
were significantly increased (by 69.3%±8.63%; Figure
2C). This result is in agreement with recent findings that
FTS upregulates peripheral Foxp3+ regulatory T cells [34, 8].

RESULTS
FTS inhibits proliferation of GL261 cells and
decreases levels of K-Ras-GTP, P-Erk and P-Akt
in vitro
GL261 cells are mouse glioma cells that carry point
mutations in the Kras and p53 genes [27]. These cells
therefore seemed suitable for studies on the cross-talk
between cancer cells and immune cells in an immunecompetent syngeneic mouse model.
We first investigated the effect of FTS on GL261 cells
in vitro. FTS (12.5‒100 µM) inhibited GL261 proliferation
in a dose-dependent manner (IC50, 43.2±3.3 µM; 4 separate
experiments, each performed in triplicate; Figure 1A). We
then examined whether the reduction in cell proliferation
was associated with downregulation of Ras and its major
downstream signals. Western blot analysis of viable cells
with specific Abs revealed that treatment with FTS (50
µM) decreased the levels of K-Ras-GTP, P-Erk, and P-Akt
by 48.26%±7.5%, 46.9%±2.67%, and 37.82%±4.02%,
respectively (Figure 1B).

Inhibition of GL261 tumor growth by FTS is not
affected by FTS-induced Foxp3 Tregs
The antitumor response of CD8+ CTLs is weakened
by an increase in CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs [19]. Seeing
that FTS causes an increase in Foxp3 expression in
lymphocytes [3-2, 8], we suspected that this might
interfere with the antitumor effect of FTS. Thus, depletion
of Tregs by the specific anti-CD25 Ab might induce an
antitumor immune response and hence enhance the FTSinduced inhibition of tumor growth [19].
To examine this possibility we used C57bl/6 mice
implanted s.c. with GL261 cells as described above. On
day 4 after tumor cell implantation the mice were divided
into three groups. To decrease the number of Tregs, mice
in the first group (n=8) were injected i.p. with 250 µg of
anti-CD25 Ab on days 4 and 11. At the same times, mice in
the second group (control, n=8) received 250 µg of IgG1
Ab. On day 5, mice in those two groups each received 60
mg of oral FTS. The third group (n=8) served as a control
for the FTS treatment and received vehicle only. Tumor
volumes were determined on days 6, 10, 17 and 21, and
the data are presented in Figure 3A. Tumor growth was
inhibited in the two groups of FTS-treated mice, and by
day 21 the decrease in tumor volume in both of these
groups relative to the vehicle-treated control was highly
significant (decrease of 70.25%±19% in the first (antiCD25 Ab-treated) group (p<0.05) and 64.69%±15.6%
(p<0.05) in the second (anti-IgG1 Ab-treated) group;
Figure 3A). However, there was no difference in tumor
volume between the two FTS-treated groups (Figure 3A),
suggesting that the specific depletion of CD25+Foxp3+
Tregs did not enhance the antitumor activity of FTS.
Importantly, in the anti-CD25 Ab-treated group we
detected, as expected, a marked decrease in CD25+Foxp3+

FTS decreases Foxp3 mRNA and protein
expression in GL261 cells in vitro
Next we examined whether GL261 cells self-express
Foxp3, and investigated the possible effect of FTS on any
such expression. FACS analysis and western blot assays
with anti-Foxp3 Ab revealed that GL261 cells express
large amounts of Foxp3 (Figure 1C, D). Treatment with
50 µM FTS for 24 hours decreased Foxp3 levels by
52.3%±9% and 41.3%±5% as determined by FACS and
by western blot analysis, respectively (Figure 1C, D).
The same treatment also resulted in a marked decrease
in Foxp3 mRNA (by 80%±18.3%; Figure 1E). These
results indicated that FTS, as opposed to its effects in T
lymphocytes [3-4, 8], induces downregulation of Foxp3
in GL261 glioma cells.

FTS inhibits subcutaneous GL261 tumor growth
in C57bl/6 mice
Our next aim was to investigate the effect of Ras
inhibition by FTS on GL261 tumor cells in a syngeneic
mouse model with a competent immune system. C57bl/6
mice were implanted s.c. with 2×106 GL261 cells (see
Methods). After 7 days the mice were randomly divided
into two groups (n=40 in each group) that were treated
daily for 12 days with oral FTS (60 mg/kg) or vehicle,
after which their excised tumors were weighed and

Tregs both in the spleens (Figure 3B) and in the tumors
(Figure 3C) of the treated mice. Thus, the FTS-induced
presence of Tregs did not interfere with the antitumor
activity of the drug. This conclusion was supported by the
results of experiments in which CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in the
spleens and in the GL261 tumors of C57bl/6 mice were
assayed without anti-CD25 Ab and with or without FTS
treatment (Figure 3D).
In another experiment, C57bl/6 mice implanted
s.c. with GL261 cells were treated daily, from 7 days
after implantation, with FTS or vehicle. On day 18 after
implantation the mice were killed and CD25+Foxp3+
levels in their excised spleens and tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) were measured by flow cytometry
(see Methods). In spleens from FTS-treated mice,
the numbers of CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells had
increased (by 203.7%±9.3% relative to controls; Figure
3D), in agreement with our previously reported results
[3-4, 8]. However, treatment with FTS had no effect on
the numbers of CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in the tumors (Figure

3D), indicating that Tregs did not migrate to the tumors or
proliferate as a result of FTS treatment. Quantification of
the results is shown in Figure 3D.

FTS decreases secretion of the immunosuppressive
cytokine TGF-β from GL261 cells
The lack of involvement of the immune system’s
regulatory arm in the antitumor activity of FTS (Figure
3), together with the finding that Foxp3 in GL261 glioma
cells was decreased after FTS treatment, suggested that
the Foxp3-depleted GL261 glioma cells might behave
like lymphocytes, and accordingly produce a proinflammatory microenvironment. To pursue this idea,
we studied the possible involvement of the immune
system’s inflammatory arm; more specifically, we wanted
to find whether the FTS-induced downregulation of
Foxp3 expression observed in GL261 cells (see Figure
2) has implications for the activity of CD8+ T cells. To

examine this possibility, we first isolated CD8+ T cells
from the spleens of GL261-tumor-bearing mice treated
with FTS for 1 week, and labeled the isolated cells with
the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester
(CFSE; see Materials and Methods). We then added them
to GL261 cells that had been pretreated for 24 h with
vehicle or increasing doses of FTS and then thoroughly
washed. Figure 4 shows that after 96 hours, CD8+ T cells
incubated with the FTS-pretreated GL261 cells attained
significantly higher proliferation rates than CD8+ T
cells incubated with untreated control GL261 cells. The
rate was dose dependent, yielding an increase in CD8+
T cells proliferation of 153.3%±1.55%, 184.8%±6.3%,
and 228.8%±6.6% in the presence of 12.5, 25 and 50
µM FTS, respectively (Figure 4A). Similar results were
obtained when we used transwells to separate the CD8+ T
cells from the GL261 cells and treated the cells with the
same FTS dosages as above. In this case, the proliferation
rates of CD8+ T cells were increased by 175.6%±13.51%,
270.2%±5.4%, and 267.56%±2.7%, respectively, relative
to controls (Figure 4B). These results suggested that FTS
reduces an anti-inflammatory response in the GL261
cells, and that this FTS effect might be mediated by a
small soluble molecule that is secreted into the media and
diffuses through the transwells.
Our next task, therefore, was to identify this putative
soluble anti-inflammatory molecule. We considered that
a possible candidate might be transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β, well known as an anti-inflammatory cytokine
with a pivotal role in the growth and progression of
gliomas [28]. Notably, glioma cells are known to induce
immune suppression via the production of interleukin-10
(IL-10) and TGF-β [29]. We recently showed, moreover,
that FTS directly perturbs TGF-β signaling to Smaddependent and Erk-dependent pathways in neurofibromindeficient cells [30]. We therefore examined the effect of
FTS on the secretion of TGF-β from GL261 cells (see
Methods). We found that FTS induced a dose-dependent
decrease in TGF-β secretion from GL261 cells (by
9.82%±0.76%, 17.52%±1.27%, and 42.67%±7.63% in
the presence of 12.5, 25 and 50 M FTS, respectively;,
Figure 4C). Accordingly, we postulated that the increase
in proliferation of CD8+ T cells observed after their
incubation with FTS-pretreated GL261 cells (Figure 4A,
B) reflects a decrease in TGF-β secretion.
To find out whether the abovementioned CD8+ T
cells contribute to the growth-inhibitory effect of FTS on
the GL261 cells, we cocultured the CD8+ T cells (isolated,
as described above, from FTS-pretreated GL261 tumorbearing mice) with FTS-pretreated GL261 cells for 96
hours, then removed the CD8+ T cells and analyzed the
viability of the GL261 cells (see Materials and Methods).
The FTS-pretreated GL261 cells that were co-cultured
with CD8+ T cells exhibited significantly lower viability
than GL261 cells that were not incubated with CD8+ T
cells (Figure 4D). The IC50 of FTS-pretreated GL261 cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that were incubated with CD8+ cells was significantly
lower than that of the nonincubated FTS-pretreated GL261
cells (14.27±1.3 µM vs. 34.87±3.4 µM FTS, Figure 4D).
Taken together, these results demonstrated that growth
inhibition by FTS enhances the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T
cells.
To support the apparent connection between the
enhanced proliferative and cytotoxic capacities of CD8+
T cells and the presence of the TGF-β cytokine, we
examined the proliferative and the cytotoxic effects of
CD8+ T cells with and without neutralization of the TGF-β
expression from GL261 cells. TGF-β was neutralized as
described in Methods. The results (Figure 4E, F) show
that neutralization of the TGF-β expressed by GL261 cells
indeed significantly increased the proliferation of CD8+ T
cells (by 175.23%±33.62, Figure 4E) and decreased their
cytotoxic activity (a decrease of 79.5%±4.65, Figure 4F).
The neutralization percentage of TGF-β in GL261 cells
was 72% (data not shown).

FTS increases the accumulation of CD8+ CTLs
within GL261 tumors
Having established that FTS enhances both the
proliferative and the cytotoxic effects of CD8+ CTLs in
vitro, we wanted to find out whether FTS had the same
effect on these T cells in vivo. We examined whether FTS
affects the accumulation of CD8+ T cells in peripheral
GL261 tumors and in the spleens of FTS-treated mice. Our
results show that FTS significantly increased the numbers
of CD8+ CTLs in the tumors (by 144.9%±7.78%, p<0.05;
Figure 4G), identifying FTS as a positive regulator of the
migration and accumulation of CD8+ CTLs in the tumors.
However, no significant differences between CD8+ T
cell numbers were observed in the spleens of FTS- and
vehicle-treated (control) mice (Figure 4G). Thus, unlike
the effect of FTS in enhancing the splenic production of
Tregs, FTS had no such effect on the splenic production
of CTLs.

FTS prolongs survival of intracranial immunecompetent tumor-bearing mice but not of tumorbearing nude mice
As mentioned earlier, GL261 cells were chosen for
the present experiments to examine the effects of FTS with
and without immune system involvement. Previous studies
have shown that FTS is able to inhibit intracranial U87
glioblastoma cell growth in nude mice but not to prolong
their survival [31]. In the present study we compared
the effect of FTS on GL261 glioma intracranial tumors
in immune-competent (C57bl/6 mice) with its effect in
immune-compromised mice (nude mice). GL261 cells
were implanted into the crania of nude mice and of
C57bl/6 mice (syngeneic hosts), as described in Methods.

Four days later we divided the mice randomly into two
groups (n=8 per group). Mice in one group were treated
with oral FTS (60 mg/kg) and the other (control) with
the carboxymethyl cellulose vehicle. Tumor growth was
assessed by gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted
MRI (see Materials and Methods) on days 10, 14 and 17 in
C57bl/6 mice and on days 13 and 21 in nude mice. Typical
images presented in Figure 5A (immune-competent mice)
and Figure 5C (nude mice) indicate that tumor growth

was attenuated in both models. However, FTS exerted
a significantly stronger inhibitory effect in the immunecompetent C57bl/6 mice than in the nude mice. In C57bl/6
mice the tumor volume was decreased by 66.6%±3.44%
and 59.67%±15.89%, respectively, on days 14 and 17
(p<0.01 on both days, Figure 5A). The decrease in the
nude mice was smaller (only 43.57%±19.58% on day 21;
p<0.05, Figure 5C).
It is important to note that FTS treatment increased

drugs (e.g. bevacizumab, semaxanib) have been developed
and approved for a variety of cancer types [32, 33-36].
Other drugs, not only against receptors but also against
their downstream targets, are now being developed.
These drugs include the Ras inhibitor salirasib (FTS), for
which clinical phase I and II clinical trials were recently
completed in patients with pancreatic or NSCLC. Ras
oncogene products that are targeted by FTS are involved
in more than 30% of all human tumors [37]. They are
therefore considered to be good targets for cancer therapy
[38].
An interesting question with regard to targeted
drug therapy has to do with the way in which nontumor
cells and tissues cope with the drug-induced inhibition

DISCUSSION
The concept of selective targeting of signal
transduction pathways has been developed over the past
few years and has proved highly successful. Thus, antiBcr Abl drugs (e.g. imatinib), anti-epidermal growth
factor receptor drugs (e.g. Erbitux and Tarceva®), antiERB2 drugs (e.g. trastuzumab) or anti-VEGF receptor

Figure 6: Proposed mechanism explaining the differential effects of Ras inhibition on immune and cancer cells. Ras

inhibition by FTS acts differently on Foxp3 expression in immune cells and in cancer cells. In immune cells, Ras regulates Foxp3 expression
via the MAPK pathway. Its inhibition results in upregulation of Foxp3 expression, thereby augmenting Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs)
[3-4]. The upregulated CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs induce an anti-inflammatory effect by secreting tolerogenic cytokines, such as IL-10 and
TGF-β, which attenuate the proliferation of effector T cells and thus help to maintain immune tolerance [42]. In the glioma cancer cells, Ras
regulates Foxp3 expression via both the MAPK and the PI3K pathways. Treatment of the cancer cells with FTS results in downregulation
of Foxp3, which in turn attenuates expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-β from glioma cells. A similar effect of Foxp3
on TGF-β expression levels has been demonstrated in melanoma cells [43]. The decrease in TGF-β produces an inflammatory tumor
microenvironment, which promotes robust proliferation, migration, and activation of antitumor CTLs. This effect on the CTLs intensifies
their antitumor character, resulting in decreased tumor growth.

of major growth and differentiation pathways. The
coping mechanisms of the immune system and the
microenvironment are of particular interest because of
the involvement of these systems in tumor growth [39].
The various drugs inhibit, either directly or indirectly,
many signaling molecules in these systems, including
MAP kinases, Akt, cyclin-dependent kinases, and
small GTPases [40]. These inhibitory activities seem to
introduce contradictory situations: on the one hand they
might reduce the antitumor activity of many targeted
drugs, while on the other hand they support some of
their antitumor activity, for example by enhancing the
antitumor activity of the immune system. One example
of possible contradictory effects is given by FTS, which
exhibits potent antitumor activity in mice [23-24] and in
humans (http://www.concordiapharma.com), and a strong
anti-inflammatory activity in mice [3]. The results of the
present study showed, however, that Ras inhibition by FTS
in mice provides a favorable antitumor environment both
in the immune system and in glioma cells. FTS was found
here to have three major effects in immune-competent
tumor-bearing mice. First, it exhibited antitumor activity
and increased survival of immune-competent mice with
intracranial gliomas (Figure 5). Notably, the increased
survival of immune-competent C57bl/6 mice relative to
nude mice was apparently a function of the presence or
absence of an intact immune system, rather than of strain
differences. For example, we previously reported that FTS
treatment of intracranial U87 gliomas failed to achieve
increased survival in nude mice [31]. Those results, like
the present findings, indicated that the increase in survival
was prevented not by the type of tumor or the strain of
mouse, but by an incompetent immune system. Second,
FTS was found to induce an increase in the antitumor
reactivity of CD8+ CTLs by downregulating TGF-β
expression in GL261 glioma cells (Figure 4). We attributed
this effect, in the present study, to the reduction in Foxp3
resulting from FTS treatment of the tumors in immunecompetent mice (see scheme in Figure 6). Interestingly,
we have also observed a decrease in Foxp3 in DLD1
colon cancer cells in vitro (unpublished data), suggesting
that the effect of FTS on cancer cells that express Foxp3
might be more general than previously supposed. Third, in
tumor-bearing immune-competent mice, an FTS-induced
increase in Tregs was observed in splenocytes (Figure 2).
Such an increase has also been reported in other mouse
strains besides C57bl/6, including Balb/c, and NOD [3-4,
7-8]. Importantly, although FTS was found here to induce
an increase in the Tregs of the splenocytes in C57bl/6
mice, no such effect was observed in the tumors (Figure 3).
In addition, depletion of peripheral CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in
tumor-bearing mice did not enhance the tumor-inhibitory
effect of FTS. Evidently, therefore, Foxp3+ Tregs do not
interfere with the inhibitory effects of FTS. These novel
findings demonstrated the antitumor activity of FTS in
immune-competent mice. They also demonstrated the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

negative involvement of Foxp3 in glioma and showed
that inhibition of Foxp3 by FTS has a favorable antitumor
activity.
Taken together, our results suggest that the impact of
FTS-induced Ras inhibition (Figures 1 and 2) on Foxp3
expression in the immune system differs from its impact
on Foxp3 expression in cancer cells. In the immune cells
it leads to upregulation of Foxp3, whereas in cancer cells
it leads to Foxp3 downregulation (see scheme in Figure.
6). The outcome of Ras inhibition in immune cells is
an enhanced anti-inflammatory response (increased
interleukin-10 and TGF-β) and immune tolerance [7].
Its outcome in GL261 glioma tumor cells, however, is
decreased secretion of TGF-β and hence an increase in the
proliferation and functional capacity of antitumor CD8+
CTLs (see Figure 4 and scheme in Figure 6). All in all, our
results highlight the importance of the immune system,
and probably also of the tumor microenvironment, in
supporting tumor growth. They also support a mechanism
by which Ras inhibition in glioma cells changes the
tumor microenvironment in a way that reduces resistance
of the tumor to the immune system and hence induces
significantly increased inhibition of cancer growth.
The importance of these results derives from the
fact that they can explain some of the major beneficial
effects of Ras inhibitors, as well as of inhibitors that act
downstream of Ras. Moreover, these beneficial effects
are not restricted to inhibition of tumor growth, but also
relate to the microenvironment and the immune system.
These are novel findings, which provide, in addition, an
experimental framework for examining the impact of
other anticancer drugs on cancer and the immune system.
Such experiments can be used for the design of drug
combinations of anticancer and immunostimulatory drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The glioma cell line GL261 was a generous gift from
the laboratory of Prof. Reuven Stein. The GL261 cell
line and splenocytes were cultured in DMEM and RPMI
medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Ha-Emek,
Israel), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin, in
a humidified environment with 5% CO2 at 37oC. FTS was
a gift from Concordia Pharmaceuticals (Fort Lauderdale,
FL).

Western blotting and GTPase pull-down assays
GL261 cells were plated at a density of 1×106 cells
per 10-cm plate, grown for 24 hours, and then treated with
FTS or 0.1% Me2SO4 (control). Cells were then lysed in
153

Cell division tracking and coculturing assays

300 µl of homogenization buffer [41], centrifuged for
10 minutes at 14 000 rpm at 4°C, and the supernatant
was collected. Equal amounts of proteins (50–100 µg
per lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by
immunoblotting with the following antibodies (Abs):
mouse anti-Pan-Ras (Ab-3) monoclonal Ab (mAb)
(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), anti-CD3 (AbD Serotec,
Oxford, UK), anti-Erk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA),
anti-P-Erk (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), anti-Akt, anti-PAKT (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-tubulin, and
anti-Foxp3 (eBioScience, San Diego, CA). Blots were
exposed to the appropriate secondary peroxidase-coupled
IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA) and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Protein
bands were quantified by densitometry with Image
EZQuant-Gel Statistical Analysis Software. Ras-GTP in
the lysates was assayed by the glutathione-S-transferase
– Ras-binding domain (GST-RBD) pull-down assay, and
this was followed by western blotting with anti-Pan-Ras
(Ab-3) mAb.

The isolated CD8+ cells were harvested, washed
twice in cold PBS, resuspended in PBS at a concentration
of 5×106 cells/ml, and stained (for assessment of their
proliferation rates) by incubation for 10 minutes at
37°C with the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein
succinimidyl ester (CFSE; 5-( and 6)-carboxyfluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester; BD Biosciences; 5 mM,
diluted 1/1000). The staining reaction was stopped by
two washes with complete medium. The stained CD8+
cells (1×105 per well) were then cocultured with GL261
cells (1×104 per well) pretreated with 12.5, 25, or 50
µM FTS in RPMI medium for 96 hours in the presence
of 2.5 µg/ml anti-CD28 (37.51) and 5 µg/ml anti-CD3e
(145-2C11) monoclonal antibodies (eBioscience). In
other experiments, we separated the CFSE-stained
CD8+ cells from the GL261 cells by using 24-well
translucent chambers, pore size 0.4 μm (Greiner Bio-One,
Frickenhausen, Germany). FTS-pretreated GL261 cells
(1×104 per well) were seeded in the lower chamber in 500
μl RPMI, and the isolated and CFSE-stained CD8+ cells
were placed on top of the membrane (1×104 per well) in
200 μl RPMI. After 96 hours the supernatant media of the
isolated and the nonisolated cultures were collected and
proliferation of the CFSE-labeled CD8+ T cells in both
sets of cultures was analyzed by flow cytometry in three
independent experiments. All migration experiments were
carried out in duplicate.

Determination of Foxp3 expression
RNA was extracted from 1×106 GL261 glioma
cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed
according to the protocol of the Reverse-iT™
1st Strand Synthesis Kit (ABgene, Epsom, UK).
Adenosine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) was
analyzed using the following primers: APRT forward
5′-GCCTCTTGGCCAGTCACCTGA-3′ and APRT
reverse 5′-CCAGGCTCACACACTCCACCA-3′. PCR
was carried out with ReddyMix™ PCR Master Mix
(ABgene) on a Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ
Research, Waltham, MA) at gene-specific conditions.
Primer sequences for Foxp3 were: Foxp3 forward 5′CACCCAGGAAAGACAGAACC -3′ and Foxp3 reverse
5′- GCAAGAGCTCTTGTCCATTGA -3′. The PCR
products were subjected to electrophoresis in 2% agarose
gel stained with ethidium bromide.

Neutralization of TGF-β
Anti-TGF-β1 mAb (R & D Systems, Ellisville, MO;
1 µg/ml) was used as a blocking antibody to neutralize the
activity of TGF-β in vitro.

Assay of TGF-β cytokine
Secretion of TGF-β from GL261 cells treated for
24 hours with 12.5, 25, or 50 µM FTS was measured by
ELISA (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO).

Cell separation and flow cytometry

In-vivo studies

Spleens and GL261 tumor tissues were removed
from C57bl/6 mice and single-cell suspensions were
stained with either phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled antiCD25 (BC96) mAb or PE-labeled anti-CD8 (LY-2)
mAb. Foxp3 was stained according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (eBioscience). Stained cells were analyzed by
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). CD8+
cells were isolated from splenocytes by the BD FACSAria
cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
Committee at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel
Aviv, Israel (Approval ID: L-11-019 for C57bl/6 mice;
L-11-024 for athymic nude mice).

Subcutaneous implantation of GL261 cells into
C57bl/6 mice

using the Medical Image Analysis version 2.4 in MATLAB
(Mathworks, MA).

Survival analysis

C57bl/6 male mice (8-10 weeks old) were housed as
described earlier [7]. On day 0, GL261 cells (2×106 cells
in 0.1 ml PBS) were implanted s.c. just proximal to the
right femur. After 7 days, by which time tumor volumes
(measured as previously described [41]) were 0.3–0.5
cm3, mice were separated randomly into two groups (40
mice per group). Mice in one group were treated daily
with oral FTS, 60 mg/kg, and mice in the other group
received vehicle (carboxymethyl cellulose). After 18 days
the mice were killed. Tumors were weighed and were then
homogenized for western blotting and FACS analysis as
described above.

Following their intracranial implantation with
GL261 cells, mice were monitored and weighed daily until
they died. Survival curves were calculated by the KaplanMeier procedure. The log-rank test was used for statistical
analysis.

Downregulation of Foxp3+ CD25+ cells in vivo
Regulatory T cells in vivo were decreased by
injection of purified anti-CD25 Ab, which blocks the
production of CD25+ cells (Tregs). Anti-CD25 Ab was
contributed by Prof. Jacob George’s lab. GL261 cells were
implanted s.c. in the flanks of C57bl/6 mice on day 0, as
above. On day 4 the tumor-bearing mice were divided into
three groups. In two of the groups each mouse was injected
i.p. on days 4 and 11, in the first group with 250 µg of
purified anti-CD25 Ab and in the second group with 250
µg of functional grade purified IgG1 Ab (eBioscience).
From day 5, both groups received FTS treatment. The
mice in the third group did not receive antibody and were
treated with the vehicle (control) instead of FTS. Tumors
were measured on days 6, 10, 17, and 21.

Intracranial implantation of GL261 glioma cells
into C57bl/6 and nude mice
Male C57bl/6 mice (4 months old) and athymic
nude mice (8‒10 weeks old) were anesthetized by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg)
and xylazine (20 mg/kg) and then placed in a stereotaxic
alignment system (Kopf Instruments, CA). A cut,
approximately 1 cm long, was made in the scalp, exposing
the skull, and a 2-mm burr hole was drilled 1 mm posterior
to the bregma and 1.5 mm lateral to it. A Hamilton 10µl syringe and a 31-gauge Hamilton needle were used to
implant 1×105 GL261 cells in 3 µl DMEM, 3 mm below
the surface of the cortex, at a rate of 1 µl/min. To avoid
backflow, the needle was left for an additional 1 minute
before being gradually removed. The scalp was stitched
and the mice were allowed to recover in their cages.
Survival rates of the tumor-bearing mice were recorded.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive analytical data are presented as means
± SEM. Tumor volumes were compared by two-way
ANOVA (repeated measures). Survival was assessed by
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by a log-rank
test. The results of all other experiments were analyzed by
unpaired Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA. Values of
p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Magnetic resonance imaging
At 10, 14, and 17 days after intracranial implantation
of GL261 cells, tumor progression was assessed by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as described earlier
[31]. The MRI scans were performed under inhalational
isoflurane (1%–2%) anesthesia (Nicholas Piramal
(Mumbai, India) in 98% oxygen. Immediately before
scanning the mice were injected i.p. with 150 µl of 0.1M
Gd-DTPA (Soreq Radiopharmaceuticals, Yavne, Israel).
Mice were scanned in a 7T/30 spectrometer (Bruker
Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany) using a quadrature head
coil and a 400 mT/m gradient system. The MRI protocol
included gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA-enhanced T1 weighted
imaging (TR=800 and TE=12 ms); field of view 2×2 cm;
matrix dimensions 256×128 (reconstructed to 256×256)
pixels). Fourteen slices, 0.8 mm thick with no gap, were
acquired in the coronal orientation. Final image resolution
was 0.078×0.078×1 mm3. The tumor area was determined
