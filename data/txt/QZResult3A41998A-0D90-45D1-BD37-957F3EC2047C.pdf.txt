Lung Cancer in China
Si-Yang Liu, MD1; Tony Mok, MD2; and Yi-Long Wu, MD1

Since the discovery of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
lung cancer treatment in China has entered the precision era. However, novel targeted agents based on novel biomarkers still need to
be developed. In the current study, the authors review the biomarker features of lung cancer in the Chinese population and the novel
agents that are aimed at novel targets. Furthermore, they discuss issues that require improvement for the production of novel drugs

INTRODUCTION
The discovery of a relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations and EGFR tyrosine kinases inhibitor (TKI) efficacy has taken the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) into the
era of precision medicine. Since the results of the Iressa Pan-Asia Study (IPASS) study were released in 2008, 8 clinical trials involving the EGFR mutation have shown that EGFR TKIs are superior to chemotherapy for patients with EGFRmutant lung cancer.1-9 EGFR TKIs have become a standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC with
EGFR mutations. Subsequently, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement gene became another target in
lung adenocarcinoma. Clinical trials have demonstrated that ALK inhibitors can effectively treat patients with ALKpositive lung adenocarcinoma at any treatment stage.10-13 A new term, driver gene, has drawn the attention of clinical
oncologists. Targeted therapy has increased the median overall survival (OS) of patients with lung cancer to 3.5 years if
they carry the driver gene.14 Clearly, the time between the initial diagnosis of lung cancer and death has shifted from
months to years. Chinese patients with lung cancer are now routinely undergoing DNA testing as part of their care,
thereby allowing clinicians to select treatments based on the genotypes to improve survival and minimize adverse effects.
Although significant advances have been achieved, due to the heterogeneity of lung cancer, only 47.9% of Chinese patients
can benefit from driver gene-focused treatment.15 The remaining 52.1% of patients with advanced lung cancer continue
to be treated with the “one size fits all” model. In addition, the median OS is reportedly only 13.7 months among Chinese
patients with advanced lung cancer according to a consecutive cohort study from the Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute.16
Thus, novel targeted agents for defined patient populations based on definitive biomarkers urgently need to be developed.
Molecular changes in Chinese patients with lung cancer differ from the changes in the white population. Based on the
results of the molecular epidemiology analysis that Wu and Gou and Wu and Zhou pooled from >2000 lung cancer cases, the
frequency of the cases of EGFR-mutated NSCLC is 28.2% in the Chinese populations, whereas it is <10% among white individuals.15,17 In addition, the frequency of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene and ALK fusion gene (EML4ALK) is found to be 5.6%, similar to that of the Western population. In enriched NSCLC (adenocarcinoma with wild-types of
both EGFR and KRAS), 16.1% of patients are reported to be positive for ALK.18,19 Conversely, mesenchymal-epithelial transition gene (MET) amplification, phosphoinositide kinase-3 (PI3K) and phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) mutations, and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) did not differ between these ethnic populations.17

Review Article

The molecular epidemiology of lung cancer in
China indicates that Chinese patients with NSCLC have
unique biomarker features, and the targeted treatment
strategy for NSCLC must be carefully selected based on
these features.
NOVEL TARGETED THERAPIES IN CHINA

with or without maintenance treatment. The median OS
was significantly longer in the group treated with ramucirumab compared with the placebo group (10.5 months vs 9.1
months; P 5 .0235), as was the median progression-free
survival (PFS) (4.5 months vs 3.0 months; P<.0001).28
We believe it is regrettable that ramucirumab is not permitted in China at the current time.

Puzzled Biomarker and Novel Agents

Antiangiogenesis is a new cancer therapy strategy that has
emerged over the last 10 years. Bevacizumab was the first
antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody.20 It has extended the median OS of patients with
nonsquamous NSCLC to 12.3 to 14.6 months.21-23
Based on the results of phase 3 E4599 and AVAiL trials
and those of a phase 4 SAiL trial, bevacizumab-based therapy has become a global standard first-line therapy for
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. Recently, a Chinese
phase 3 registration trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01364012) reported a best OS of 24.3 months. Surprisingly, Chinese patients with lung cancer who were
treated with bevacizumab are reported to have an OS that
is 10 months longer than that of white patients.24 To the
best of our knowledge, the heterogeneity of clinical tumor
responses to antiangiogenic therapies is poorly understood. Because VEGF is considered to be one of the most
potent angiogenic and endothelial cell survival factors, it
may be an interesting biomarker for antiangiogenic
agents. However, to our knowledge, biomarkers such as
VEGF that predict the clinical benefit of antiangiogenic
agents have not yet been identified. Nevertheless, the targeting of the antiangiogenic pathway has become increasingly attractive in clinical trials.

Nintedanib (BIBF1120)

Ramucirumab

Apatinib

Ramucirumab is a fully immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal
antibody that selectively inhibits VEGFR-2 and blocks
the VEGFR-2-related signaling and activating pathways.25 It received its first global approval in the United
States for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric
cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.26
On December 12, 2014, the US Food and Drug
Administration expanded the indication for ramucirumab
to include the treatment of patients with metastatic
NSCLC based on findings from the phase 3 REVEL trial.27
This international study involved a total of 1253 patients
with NSCLC from 26 countries on 6 continents including
Taiwan. It was designed to compare treatment with ramucirumab plus docetaxel with placebo plus docetaxel in
patients with stage IV NSCLC whose disease progressed
during or after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy

Apatinib is a novel VEGFR-2 TKI that was independently
developed in China.32 This orally administered, smallmolecular receptor TKI has shown encouraging efficacy
and safety in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer.33
Since January 2015, a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial has been recruiting
patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC harboring
wild-type EGFR to assess the efficacy of apatinib as a
third-line/fourth-line treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02332512).

3090

Nintedanib is a triple angiokinase inhibitor that targets
VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3; fibroblast growth
factor receptor (FGFR)21, FGFR-2, and FGFR-3; and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor a/b signaling.29
A total of 173 Chinese patients have been recruited
as part of the LUME-Lung 1 trial, which was designed to
compare the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus nintedanib with docetaxel plus placebo as a second-line therapy
in patients with NSCLC who have experienced disease
progression after first-line chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00805194).
Combination therapy with nintedanib and docetaxel has been found to significantly improve the primary
endpoint of PFS from the results of the LUME-Lung 1
trial (median, 3.4 months vs 2.7 months; P 5 .0019).
However, the benefits on OS were only observed in
patients with adenocarcinoma (median, 12.6 months vs
10.3 months; P 5 .0359) but not in the total study population.30 Thus, the addition of nintedanib to docetaxel is
an effective second-line option for patients with advanced
NSCLC, especially those with adenocarcinoma, without
detrimental effects on the patient self-reported quality of
life.30,31

Famitinib

Famitinib, which was also independently developed in
China, is a small-molecule, multitarget receptor TKI of
VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3.34 Furthermore,
Cancer

the manufacturer also conducted a clinical trial of famitinib. A phase 2 study is currently underway to investigate
the ability of famitinib to prolong PFS in Chinese patients
with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT02356991). This randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study is now
recruiting patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC
in China.
Moreover, a phase 2 study to assess the safety and
maximum tolerated dose of continuous daily treatment
with famitinib plus docetaxel (60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks)
in the same Chinese population is also currently ongoing
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02364362).
Fruquintinib

Fruquintinib (HMPL-013), which was also developed on
the Chinese mainland, is a highly potent and selective
small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and
VEGFR-3.35
A randomized phase 2 study to assess the efficacy
and safety of fruquintinib combined with the best supportive care for Chinese patients with nonsquamous
NSCLC who have experienced disease progression after
second-line chemotherapy has been initiated
(CTR20140396).
The novel antiangiogenesis agents and relevant clinical trials introduced above demonstrate that Chinese
researchers are conducting new clinical trials to explore
deeper problems. Local companies have developed new
antiangiogenesis agents.
However, the poorly understood role of biomarkers
has hindered the development of new drugs. For example,
in addition to famitinib and fruquintinib, other antiangiogenesis agents targeting VEFGR have been developed
by local companies, such as apatinib, sulfatinib, and henatinib. Both sulfatinib and henatinib received approval for
the treatment of gastric cancer and lung cancer in 2010.36
The mechanisms and targets of these drugs are similar,
but they lack a clear predictive biomarker. Thus, “novel”
agents are not sufficiently “novel.” Innovative agents with
unique mechanisms and targets still need to be developed
in the future.

to 20 to 30 months, patients who initially respond to
EGFR TKIs eventually acquire resistance.37 The EGFRT790M mutation, which is considered to be the main cause
of acquired resistance, occurs in 48.3% of Chinese TKIresistant patients.38 However, de novo T790M mutations
have also been found in nearly 1% of Chinese patients with
NSCLC before the administration of TKIs, which indicates
that T790M could also lead to primary resistance.39 Thus,
new drugs have been developed to overcome this resistance,
such as AZD9291, CO-1686, and afatinib.
AZD9291 is a novel oral, potent, and selective
third-generation irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR
mutation-sensitizing and T790M-resistant mutants.
International coordinating principal investigators from
Hong Kong (T.M.) and the Chinese mainland (Y-l. W.)
are currently leading a global phase 3 trial (AURA-3 trial)
to compare AZD9291 with platinum-based doublet
chemotherapy in patients with EGFR TKI-resistant and
T790M-positive disease (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT02151981). Another phase 2 trial, AURA 17, an
Asia regional trial that recruited patients who were positive for the T790M, is currently ongoing.
It is interesting to note that avitinib, an indigenous
EGFR TKI developed in China, is currently undergoing
clinical testing. A phase 1, single-arm trial is being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
and antitumor activity of avitinib in Chinese patients who
progressed to advanced NSCLC while receiving prior
therapy with an EGFR TKI agent and were then identified as being positive for T790M (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02274337). The preliminary results of this
trial are expected to be released in 2016.
Based our experience, resistance to EGFR TKIs is heterogeneous in clinical practice.40 Several issues need to be
considered when attempting to overcome T790M resistance, including the timing of a second biopsy, the timing of
the administration of a T790M inhibitor based on Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria or
clinical disease progression, and methods to monitor disease
progression. Resolving these issues could allow T790M
inhibitors to be successfully used in clinical practice.

MET amplification is related to the development of resistance to EGFR inhibitors, which occurs in 15% to 20% of
patients with EGFR TKI resistance.41 Clinical studies of
MET amplification are currently focused on smallmolecule anti-MET TKIs, such as INC280 and crizotinib, because the majority of antibodies against cMET
failed in clinical trials.42
3091

Review Article

A high-profile phase 1B/2 study of INC280 in combination with gefitinib was designed to detect the efficacy,
safety, and phase 2 dose of this combination therapy in
adult patients with mutant EGFR, c-MET-amplified
NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with EGFR
TKIs (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01610336). Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, this study is one of
the few phase 1B/2 trials to recruit patients based on their
genetic profile. Seventeen Chinese patients were enrolled
in this study. As reported at the 50th American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in 2014,43
the preliminary results demonstrated that oral INC280 in
combination with gefitinib was well tolerated. This preliminary clinical activity supports the further evaluation
of INC280 combined with gefitinib in patients with
MET-positive NSCLC that is resistant to EGFR TKIs.43
If the clinical activity is confirmed in a future phase 3
study, combination therapy with INC280 and gefitinib
would be the best choice for patients with MET-positive
NSCLC that is resistant to EGFR TKIs.
With regard to crizotinib, the efficacy and safety data
for this drug in patients with advanced c-Met-amplified
NSCLC were presented at the 50th ASCO Annual Meeting (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00585195).44 To
the best of our knowledge, this report was the first abstract
to date to demonstrate the antitumor activity of crizotinib
in patients with de novo, c-MET-amplified NSCLC and a
generally manageable toxicity profile. Further study on this
landscape is still warranted in the future.
Several anti-MET TKI compounds have been developed in China, such as CT053PTSA and volitinib.45
Both of these drugs have entered phase 1 clinical trials of
their efficacy and tolerability in patients with advanced
solid tumors (CTR20131150 and ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT01985555). Furthermore, a phase 1 study
of the safety and pharmacokinetics of volitinib in combination with gefitinib currently is underway in patients
with EGFR mutation-positive disease who experienced
disease progression after treatment with EGFR TKIs
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02374645).
ALK gene rearrangement

Although the ALK inhibitor crizotinib has shown great efficacy in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma at any
treatment stage, patients eventually acquire resistance
within 1 or 2 years.46 Thankfully, LDK378 and alectinib
are promising treatment alternatives.
LDK378 is a second-generation ALK inhibitor that
has shown great efficacy in patients with advanced, ALKrearranged NSCLC, including those who experienced dis3092

ease progression during treatment with crizotinib.47 We
believe it was regrettable that Chinese patients did not
take part in this study. However, a phase 1/2, multicenter,
open-label, single-arm study of LDK378 has been conducted in adult Chinese patients with ALK-rearranged
advanced NSCLC who were previously treated with crizotinib (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02040870). Furthermore, China is also one of the main countries
partaking in a global phase 3 trial designed to compare
LDK378 with standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus
cisplatin or pemetrexed plus carboplatin) in previously
untreated adult patients with ALK-rearranged, stage
IIIB/IV NSCLC (Union for International Cancer Control
TNM classification through July 31, 2009, and according
to the seventh edition from August 1, 2009.) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01828099). Both of these trials
currently are at the stage of recruiting participants.
Alectinib is a potent, selective, ALK inhibitor. In a
phase 1/2 study, alectinib has shown promising antitumor
activity in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC that is
resistant to crizotinib, including those with central nervous system metastases (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier
NCT01588028).48 Therefore, treatment-naive patients
with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC are currently being
recruited from 181 study locations worldwide, including
Hong Kong, for a phase 3 study that aims to compare
alectinib with crizotinib (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier
NCT02075840).49
Moreover, AP26113 is a novel dual ALK-/EGFR
TKI that potently inhibits the ALK-L1196M and EGFRT790M mutations. Principal investigators from Hong
Kong currently are recruiting patients with ALK-positive
advanced NSCLC for a phase 2 study of AP26113 (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier NCT02094573).
Due to endless efforts over the past several years, the
second and even the third generation of EGFR TKIs, antiMET TKIs, and ALK inhibitors have been developed to
overcome acquired resistance. However, patients eventually acquire resistance even to the newest targeted therapies.
Chinese investigators continue to work on defining the
mechanism and developing new methods to overcome the
seemingly inevitable acquired resistance to these therapies.

A multicenter, single-arm, phase 1 dose escalation
study of BGJ398 in East Asian patients with advanced
solid malignancies harboring either FGFR-1 or FGFR-2
amplification or FGFR-3 mutations is currently ongoing

may become a potential targeted therapy for patients with
squamous NSCLC.
ROS1 gene fusion

The ROS1 fusion gene has been detected in 2.4% of East
Asian patients with lung adenocarcinoma. ROS1-positive
patients tend to be younger and to have characteristic histologic subtypes.51
Because the structures of ALK and ROS1 are similar,
patients with advanced NSCLC harboring ROS1 gene
fusion are also highly sensitive to crizotinib.52 A multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study was completed in September 2013. This trial investigated the efficacy of singleagent crizotinib in East Asian patients with advanced
NSCLC harboring ROS1 gene fusion (ClinicalTrial.gov
identifier NCT01945021). A total of 127 patients were
enrolled in this study, including 74 Chinese patients. We
currently are awaiting the results to confirm the efficacy of
crizotinib in East Asian patients with ROS1 gene fusion.

HMPL-813 is a novel targeted agent that was developed in Shanghai, China. A phase 1 study currently is
investigating the efficacy and toxicity of HMPL-813 and
its association with different biomarkers such as EGFR,
cMET, PI3K, and EML4-ALK (CTR20130972).
To allow more patients to benefit from targeted
therapy, Chinese researchers have attempted to develop
new-generation agents that act on existing targets while
also exploring novel targets. Given recent advances in
next-generation sequencing, additional driver mutations
may be detected in the future, and all tumors may be
sequenced at the time of diagnosis to identify potential
driver mutations that can be therapeutically targeted. This
strategy would allow patients to maximize the benefits of
precision medicine. Details regarding clinical trials of
novel targeted treatment in China are shown in Table 1.
Rare Mutations and New Trial Design

Beyond EGFR and ALK, cancer heterogeneity and
genomic complexity complicate biomarker-driven trials.
For example, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) is only found in 1% of patients with NSCLC.
Accruing a sufficient number of patients with this rare
mutation for a corresponding trial is a significant problem.
Innovative trial design has become a necessity in the era of
precise medicine. One umbrella trial, named CLUSTER,
was initiated in 2014 in China. Patients with advanced
NSCLC received drugs against various targets based on
their molecular profile. The goal of the CLUSTER trial is
to identify promising targets and drugs. This study was
designed as an open trial: novel agents and biomarkers
could be included at any time. Five drugs targeting

different molecular abnormalities were initially included
in the trial: BYL719 for patients with a PIK3CA mutation/amplification; INC280 for patients with METpositive tumors; LDK378 for patients with ALK or ROS1
rearrangement; MEK162 for patients with KRAS, NRAS,
or BRAF mutations; and allitinib for patients with HER2
or HER4 mutations (Fig. 1).54 Each treatment arm is independent of the others and will be analyzed separately. If
the response rate of 1 agent reaches 40%, a phase 2 trial
will be extended. By grouping multiple open trials simultaneously, the CLUSTER study will reduce the overall
screen failure rate and provide more opportunities to
match patient biomarkers with agents. This study will be a
significant landmark in the precise medicine era in China.
THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF NOVEL
TARGETED THERAPIES IN CHINA
According to the ClinicalTrials.gov Web site, Chinese
clinical sites had participated in >1000 studies by 2014.
The NSCLC studies have placed Chinese trial sites on the
map internationally and tested the drugs that emerged
from the laboratories of overseas companies. Although
China follows the development of targeted therapies for
lung cancer, it has also been a leader in innovation.
3094

Since the first small-molecule targeted antitumor
drug, called icotinib, was developed by a Chinese company, nearly 15 types of novel lung cancer targeted
agents for clinical trials have emerged in China. Furthermore, based on the register at the chinadrugstrial.org.cn
Web site, nearly 10 studies that were independently initiated by local companies were registered within the last
year.
Although early success has been achieved in the development of innovative agents, China’s drug development capability can still improve in some areas.
As mentioned above, “novel” agents are currently
not sufficiently “novel” enough. Although the number of
early-phase trials in China has tripled in recent years and
the number of new antitumor agents submitted for approval within the last year has increased, the majority of
these agents were developed based on the adjusted structures or the same mechanism as those used for drug development by international companies.55,56 The capability
to develop innovative agents remains weak because of the
limited awareness of risk and complexity and the lack of
an overall clinical development strategy for innovative
domestic drugs. Since the lung cancer genomic landscape
was revealed, more targetable driven genes with a low incidence will continue to be discovered. Based on the large
patient resource, Chinese industries and researchers may
be able to create new drugs based on novel targets in the
future.
Second, the regulatory environment limits the development of novel agents. In China, novel drugs are
approved based on the examination and approval system,
not the file system. All novel agents must wait nearly 2 to
4 years for approval. The average review timeline is
approximately 1 to 2 years for clinical trial authorization
approvals and 2 years for new drug application approvals.
Domestic companies also must wait much longer for regulatory approval than international industries.57 Thus,
patients may be unable to receive the most effective treatment in time. Due to significant efforts on the part of the
government, the overall clinical trial environment in
China has improved over the past 5 years. The Chinese
Food and Drug Administration is actively reforming the
regulatory framework of novel agent approval and will
likely further adjust its policies to be in step with the rest
of the world.
Third, patients should be encouraged to participate
in clinical trials. Currently, most Chinese patients refuse
to be enrolled in clinical trials because they consider novel
drugs to be experiments that are ineffective or unsafe. In
fact, the safety and efficacy of novel drugs that are tested

in phase 3 studies have been demonstrated by the results
of the previous phase 1/2 study. Furthermore, oncologists
regularly monitor the efficacy of new drugs. Thus, clinical
trials offer therapeutic opportunities for patients, and
physicians should encourage qualified patients to
participate.
Finally, according to the biomarker features of the
Chinese population, only approximately one-half of
patients with NSCLC and no patients with small cell lung
cancer can currently benefit from targeted therapy. Moreover, patients who receive targeted therapies are also
financially burdened by the price of these drugs. Thus,
novel therapeutic targets need to be identified urgently to
develop effective drugs that are more affordable than those
available in the West. Along with the discovery of new targets and agents, launching separate trials that examine
each oncogenic driver and the corresponding drugs would
be too time-consuming and cost-intensive. The design of
the CLUSTER trial provides a novel direction, and we
will design clinical trials that fit Chinese biomarker characteristics in the future. Despite the availability of smallmolecule targeted drugs, immunotherapy has brought
hope to the treatment of lung cancer. The checkpoint
inhibitors targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
protein 4 and the programmed cell death 1 pathway have
shown durable clinical responses with manageable toxicity. Several phase 2 and 3 clinical trials testing the association between different schedules of chemotherapy and
immunotherapy or immunotherapy alone are ongoing in
patients with lung cancer and important results are
expected in the near future.58 However, more studies are
awaited to further confirm this treatment.
China is now committed to improving the situations
discussed above, developing more exciting targeted drugs,
and performing high-quality clinical trials that will
improve the lives of patients with lung cancer in China
and worldwide.
