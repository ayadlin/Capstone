Abstract
In an effort to develop cancer therapies that maximize cytotoxicity, while minimizing unwanted side effects, we
studied a series of novel compounds based on the highly energetic heterocyclic scaffold, dinitroazetidine. In this
study, we report the preclinical validation of 1-bromoacetyl-3,3-dinitroazetidine (ABDNAZ), a representative lead
compound currently in a phase I clinical trial in patients with cancer. In tumor cell culture, ABDNAZ generated
reactive free radicals in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, modulating intracellular redox status and
triggering apoptosis. When administered to mice as a single agent, ABDNAZ exhibited greater cytotoxicity than
cisplatin or tirapazamine under hypoxic conditions. However, compared with cisplatin, ABDNAZ was better
tolerated at submaximal doses, yielding signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition in the absence of systemic toxicity.
Similarly, when combined with radiation, ABDNAZ accentuated antitumor efﬁcacy along with the therapeutic
index. Toxicity studies indicated that ABDNAZ was not myelosuppressive and no dose-limiting toxicity was
apparent following daily administration for 14 days. Taken together, our ﬁndings offer preclinical proof-ofconcept for ABDNAZ as a promising new anticancer agent with a favorable toxicity proﬁle, either as a
chemotherapeutic agent or a radiosensitizer. Cancer Res; 72(10); 2600–8. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated
1.4 million people will be diagnosed with cancer each year in
the United States and the number of predicted cancer deaths
will be more than half a million (1). Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are two main modalities of cancer treatment but
often fail to cure many patients. The key factors limiting the
therapeutic efﬁcacy are the dose-limiting toxicities on normal
tissues and the existence of hypoxic tumor cells (2, 3). Chemotherapy has been used with radiotherapy to treat the
radioresistant tumors but is often associated with signiﬁcantly
increased toxicity (4). The identiﬁcation of agents that specifically target and radiosensitize hypoxic tumor cells is a promising area of investigation. A number of different radiosensitizers have been developed, such as hyperbaric oxygen (5),
electron afﬁnity nitroimidazole compounds (6, 7), thiol depletion agents (8–10), metal texaphyrin (11), and bioreductive
compounds (12). However, the normal tissue toxicity and the
formation of toxic byproducts have been the signiﬁcant proAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Radiation Oncology and 2Radiology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford; and 3RadioRx, Inc.,

blems for clinical use with these radiosensitization approaches
(13). For these reasons, it is important to develop new therapeutic agents with improved efﬁcacy, minimal toxicity to
normal tissues, and an enhanced therapeutic window.
Energetic materials are chemical compounds that contain
signiﬁcant quantities of potential energy that is released upon
activation and breakage of chemical bonds. These materials
can be designed for controllable storage and release of chemical energy under speciﬁc conditions (14). In an effort to
develop unique targeted cancer therapies, which maximize
cytotoxicity to cancer cells, while minimizing unwanted side
effects to normal tissue, we have studied a series of novel
compounds based on the highly energetic heterocyclic dinitroazetidine scaffold, which can be selectively activated in
tumors in a controlled manner. Our research has resulted in
the selection of a lead compound, 1-bromoacetyl-3,3-dinitroazetidine (ABDNAZ), for clinical development both as a standalone chemotherapeutic agent and as a radiation sensitizer.
Activation of ABDNAZ resulted in selective targeting of hypoxic
tumors and enhancement of the effect of radiation by locally
releasing highly energetic free radicals in tumors as well as by
increasing tumor blood ﬂow. Our data show that ABDNAZ is a
promising novel anticancer drug with a very favorable toxicity
proﬁle that is efﬁcacious in preclinical tumor models as both a
stand-alone chemotherapeutic agent and as a radiosensitizer.

volume. Three days later, plates were washed with PBS and
reﬁlled with 100 mL of phenol red–free growth medium. CCK-8
solution was added and after 2-hour incubation at 37 C, the
optical absorbance of wells was measured at a wavelength of
450 nm with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Cell
viability was calculated as the percentage of the optical density
of the treated cells to that of untreated control cells.

is reported in detail elsewhere (15, 16).
Cell lines
Eleven human cancer cell lines and a murine squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) cell line (Table 1) were grown and maintained
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in a 37 C humidiﬁed
incubator with a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2. The identity
of cells has regularly been conﬁrmed throughout the course of
the studies by observation of the growth pattern and cell
morphology in vitro and in vivo. All experiments were carried
out on exponentially growing cells with cell population doubling times of approximately 20 to 36 hours.
In vitro cytotoxicity assay
Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), a modiﬁed MTT assay with 2(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (Dojindo Molecular Technologies), was
used to measure the cytotoxicty of ABDNAZ. Cells were inoculated into 96-well plates and incubated overnight. Freshly

In vitro clonogenic assay
Survival curves were generated with an in vitro clonogenic
assay as previously described (17). Brieﬂy, cells were inoculated
in Petri dishes and irradiated in the presence or absence of
ABDNAZ with a 137Cs source at a dose rate of 300 cGy/min.
After irradiation, cells were incubated for 10 to 14 days and
stained with crystal violet for colony count.
For in vitro clonogenic assays after exposure to hypoxia, cells
were inoculated in 60-mm glass dishes with medium containing freshly prepared ABDNAZ and loaded into gas-tight aluminum gassing chambers on a shaking table. Hypoxia was
achieved in the chambers through a series of 5 alternate
evacuations followed by gassing with 95% nitrogen and 5%
CO2 to 20 psi at 37 C. After the last round of gassing, the
chambers were incubated on the shaking table at 37 C for 2 to 4
hours and then irradiated. Cells were rinsed, trypsinized,
counted, and plated in Petri dishes in triplicate for colony
formation as described earlier.
Measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species
Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured
with a ﬂuorescent probe 20 70 -dichloroﬂuorescein diacetate
(DCFH-DA; Invitrogen Molecular Probes) as previously
described (18). Brieﬂy, cells were grown in a black 96-well
plate overnight, incubated with DCFH-DA probe for 1 hour,
and treated with ABDNAZ and/or irradiation. Immediately
following addition of ABDNAZ or radiation, the green ﬂuorescence was observed under a ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica
Microsystems) and quantitated with a spectroﬂuorometer
(Molecular Devices). The green ﬂuorescence was measured
again at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 to 24 hours after
treatment.
DNA damage assay
DNA damage was assayed by immunocytochemical staining
of gH2AX. Cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips in a
60-mm dish. After exposure to ABDNAZ, cells were washed
with PBS, ﬁxed in ice-cold methanol for 10 minutes at 20 C,
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes, and
blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 minutes. Cells
were incubated with a primary rabbit anti-human phosphohistone gH2AX antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for
60 minutes and then incubated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for 60 minutes in dark. After washing with
PBS, coverslips were mounted on slides with a drop of mounting medium containing 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Slides were visualized and photographed by a Leica ﬂuorescence microscope.

Apoptosis analysis
Apoptotic cell death was quantitated by measuring the
number of subdiploid (sub-G1) cells stained with propidium
iodide (PI) as described previously (18). Brieﬂy, ABDNAZtreated and untreated control cells were collected and ﬁxed
with ethanol, treated with RNase A, and stained with PI. The
DNA content was analyzed with a FACScan ﬂow cytometer
(Becton, Dickinson and Company). The percentage of cells in
the sub-G1 phase was calculated as previously described.
Tumor model and therapy
Male C3H mice, 7 to 8 weeks old and 20 to 25 grams in body
weight, were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice
were normally bred and maintained under speciﬁc pathogenfree conditions and sterilized food and water were available
ad libitum. Mice were injected s.c. in the right ﬂank with 5 
105 SCC VII tumor cells in 0.05 mL Hank solution. When tumors
reached an average size of 150 mm3 (100–300 mm3), mice were
randomly assigned to the treatment groups. ABDNAZ was
injected i.p. or i.v. at doses as speciﬁed in each experiment.
For irradiation, the unanesthetized tumor-bearing mice were
placed in individual lead boxes with tumors protruding through
a cutout window at the rear of each box. Radiation was delivered
by a Philips RT-250 200 kVp X-ray unit (12.5 mA; half value
layer, 1.0 mm Cu) at a dose rate of 140 cGy/min. The length and
width of the tumors were measured with calipers before treatment, and 3 times a week thereafter until the tumor volume
reached at least 4 times (4) the pretreatment volume. The
tumor volume was calculated with the formula: tumor volume ¼
p/6  length  width2. The tumor volume quadrupling time
(TVQT) was determined by a best-ﬁt regression analysis. The
tumor growth delay (TGD) time is the difference between the
TVQT of treated tumors compared with that of untreated
control tumors. Both the TVQT and TGD time were calculated
for each individual animal and then averaged for each group. The
data are presented as percentage of the pretreatment volume
on day 0. Body weight of animals was measured 3 times a week.
The animal experiments described herein were approved by the
Stanford University (Stanford, CA) Administrative Panel for
Laboratory Animal Care.
Microbubble-enhanced ultrasound image
Blood perfusion and blood volume in tumors were assessed
by microbubble-enhanced ultrasound imaging as previously
reported (19). Brieﬂy, tumor-bearing mice were treated with
ABDNAZ and radiation and then imaged at various time points
on a Vevo770 system (VisualSonics Inc.). Mice were anesthetized with a 3% isoﬂurane oxygen and imaged with a 6  6 mm2
view ﬁeld. A baseline image was acquired before microbubble
injection. The contrast-enhanced image was acquired 5 seconds after a bolus injection of the nontargeted microbubble
contrast agent (1.0  108 microbubbles/0.1 mL) via a tail vein
catheter. Images were acquired at a frame rate of 18 frames per
second for a total of 800 frames. The image data were analyzed
with Vevo770 Contrast Mode software by comparing the
contrast cine loop with the baseline cine loop to generate a
contrast overlay to identify the differences in image intensity
between these 2 loops.

Intestinal crypt stem cell assay
The detailed procedure for intestinal crypt cell survival
following irradiation has been described elsewhere (20). Briefly, one group of mice was irradiated with total body irradiation
(TBI). Another group of mice was injected i.p. with 10 mg/kg
ABDNAZ 10 minutes before TBI. Three days after radiation, the
duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were removed, ﬁxed, and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Surviving crypts
(10 cells) for each cross-section were counted under
microscopy.
Statistics
Data were statistically analyzed with a 2-tailed Student t test.
The dose-modifying factor (DMF) attributable to the radiosensitization effect of ABDNAZ was calculated by dividing the
radiation dose without ABDNAZ by the radiation dose
required to produce the same survival in the presence of
ABDNAZ (21).

Results
ABDNAZ is a potent chemotherapeutic agent
The cytotoxic antiproliferative effects of ABDNAZ were
studied on a panel of 12 cancer cell lines in vitro with a
CCK-8 cell counting kit. The IC50 values (concentration
required for 50% inhibition of cell growth) ranged from 1.8 to
6.0 mmol/L (Table 1). Comparison with cisplatin (CDDP)
showed that ABDNAZ had similar activity to CDDP against
4 human cancer cell lines and SCC VII cells, with IC50 values of
2.6  1.6 mmol/L and 4.4  2.2 mmol/L for ABDNAZ and CDDP
(P > 0.05), respectively (Fig. 2A).
Cytotoxic activity of ABDNAZ is enhanced under hypoxia
The cytotoxicity of ABDNAZ under hypoxic condition compared with normal aerobic condition was examined in SCC VII
cells with a clonogenic assay. Cells were exposed to ABDNAZ
for 2 hours in a hypoxia chamber or in a cell culture incubator.
In addition, tirapazamine, a hypoxic cytotoxin (22), was included in the study as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 2B, SCC
VII cells were more sensitive to ABDNAZ under hypoxia than
under normoxia. The IC50 values were 0.14 and 0.66 mmol/L for
cells under hypoxia and normoxia, respectively, representing a
4.7-fold increase in cytotoxicity under hypoxic condition. In a
separate experiment, ABDNAZ was found to be even more
potent than tirapazamine under hypoxia (Fig. 2C). The IC50
values for ABDNAZ and tirapazamine were 0.14 and 0.96
mmol/L (P < 0.01), respectively.
ABDNAZ increases intracellular ROS generation, gH2AX
expression, and apoptosis
To test the initial hypothesis that ABDNAZ would generate
ROS that would have downstream cytotoxic effects on tumor
cells, levels of intracellular ROS, DNA damage (gH2AX expression), and apoptosis of tumor cells following exposure to
ABDNAZ were measured. Data showed that ABDNAZ induced
intracellular ROS generation in a dose- and time-dependent
manner in HT29 and SCC VII cell lines (Fig. 3A). The levels of
intracellular ROS increased and peaked at 6 hours after

ABDNAZ inhibits tumor growth in vivo
The in vivo antitumor effect of ABDNAZ was studied in mice
bearing SCC VII tumors. This is an aggressive tumor with a
volume doubling time of approximately 2 days. ABDNAZ was
prepared as a solution in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water
and administered i.p. with either 5 mg/kg body weight daily for
5 days or 10 mg/kg every other day for 3 doses or 15 mg/kg 2
doses in the ﬁrst week. All 3 ABDNAZ regimens inhibited
tumor growth and resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in TGD
time (1.8–4.5 days, P < 0.01, compared with untreated control
tumors; Fig. 4A). ABDNAZ at 15 mg/kg for 2 doses total was
more effective than other dose regimens tested (P < 0.01). None
of the ABDNAZ regimens caused a signiﬁcant decrease in

addition of ABDNAZ in HT29 cells and at 2 hours in SCC VII
cells. For HT29 cells, the ﬂuorescence signals increased from a
baseline of 1.3  2.1 measured before ABDNAZ treatment to 6.5
 1.0, 27.5  3.0, and 69.2  17.5 at 6 hours after exposure to 1,
10, and 100 mmol/L of ABDNAZ, respectively. For SCC VII cells,
the ﬂuorescence signals increased from 8.7  2.4 at baseline to
19.1  7.6, 63.2  25.7, and 160.6  29.8 at 6 hours for 1, 10, and
100 mmol/L ABDNAZ, respectively.
ABDNAZ-induced gH2AX expression in HT29 cells and SCC
VII cells was found to increase in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 3B). The gH2AX-positive HT29 cells increased
from 0.5%  0.4% before ABDNAZ treatment to 49.4%  9.5%
after 2 hours of exposure to 10 mmol/L ABDNAZ, representing a
99-fold increase in unrepaired DNA damage. Corresponding
induction of apoptosis also increased over 72 hours (Fig. 3C). At
72 hours, 5 mmol/L ABDNAZ induced 60% apoptosis in SCC VII
cells and 96% in promyeloblastic leukemia HL60 cells (P < 0.01
vs. baseline). At the same time point, ABDNAZ at 4 mmol/L
induced 45% apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma Daudi cells. ABDNAZ at 2 mmol/L also induced a signiﬁcant level of apoptosis
compared with the baseline (Fig. 3C).
To examine whether ABDNAZ-induced apoptosis was due
to the generation of ROS, we treated HL60 cells and Daudi cells
with a glutathione (GSH) precursor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC),
and a GSH synthesis inhibitor, buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoxime
(BSO), and measured the level of apoptosis (Fig. 3D). Pretreatment with NAC was found to completely inhibit ABDNAZinduced apoptosis. The level of apoptosis decreased from 21%
after ABDNAZ exposure to 1% baseline in HL60 cells and from
11% for ABDNAZ to 5% of baseline in Daudi cells. In contrast,
pretreatment with BSO increased ABDNAZ-induced apoptosis
from 21% to 33% in HL60 cells and from 11% to 25% in Daudi
cells, suggesting that intracellular redox status and ROS generation impact ABDNAZ-induced apoptotic cell death.
Next, we treated tumor-bearing mice with one i.v. dose of 10
mg/kg ABDNAZ with or without coadministration of one dose
of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg NAC. NAC alone had a minor effect on
tumor growth (P ¼ 0.3 vs. control). When given in combination
with ABDNAZ, NAC slightly reduced the ABDNAZ-induced
TGD time of 1.7  1.4 days to 1.3  0.3 days and 1.1  0.5 days
for 500 and 1,000 mg/kg NAC (P > 0.05, n ¼ 6–8), respectively.
Although these differences in TGD time were small, these data
do suggest that NAC decreased the cytotoxic effect of ABDNAZ
in vivo (Fig. 4C).

animal body weight when compared with untreated control
mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Next, we studied the antitumor activity of oral administration of ABDNAZ. Tumor-bearing mice were orally gavaged
with ABDNAZ at doses of either 12 mg/kg for 5 days or 20 mg/
kg every other day for 3 doses or one dose of 60 mg/kg. All 3
dose regimens delayed tumor growth (P < 0.01 vs. control) and
did not cause signiﬁcant loss of body weight (Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
We also compared the antitumor efﬁcacy of ABDNAZ and
cisplatin. Mice with SCC VII tumors were injected i.p. with a
single dose of either 15 mg/kg ABDNAZ or 10 mg/kg CDDP
(MTD at 12 mg/kg). As shown in Fig. 4B, ABDNAZ was as
potent as CDDP at inhibiting tumor growth, and produced a
TGD time of 4.5  1.1 days for ABDNAZ compared with 4.3 
0.9 days for CDDP (P ¼ 0.7). In addition, observations of the
animals during the study suggested that the ABDNAZ-treated
mice appeared healthier than the cisplatin-treated mice.
Taken together, our data showed that ABDNAZ is a potential
anticancer agent without obvious systemic toxicities in terms
of body weight loss.

ABDNAZ is a potent radiation sensitizer
Because ABDNAZ is activated both by hypoxia and ionizing
irradiation (15), we hypothesized that ABDNAZ could be used
in combination with radiation therapy as a radiosensitizer to
selectively enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, especially in hypoxia. We initially studied the effect of ABDNAZ on
the radiation response of HT29 cells and SCC VII cells in vitro
under normal conditions. ABDNAZ alone reduced survival by
50% at 0.1 mmol/L, 80% at 1 mmol/L, and 99% at 2 mmol/L in
both cell lines. When combined with radiation, treatment with
ABDNAZ shifted the radiation survival curves downward (Fig.
5A). The radiation survival at 2Gy (SF2) was decreased from
72% to 12% in HT29 cells and from 89% to 1.4% in SCC VII cells.
At 10 Gy, ABDNAZ further decreased the radiation survival
from 1.3% to 0.07% for HT29 cells and from 3.3% to 0.03% in
SCC VII cells, respectively. The radiation DMFs of ABDNAZ
were 1.7 and 1.6 at 10% survival for HT29 cells and SCC VII cells,
respectively.
We next studied the effect of ABDNAZ on radiation survival
under hypoxia. SCC VII cells were preexposed to 1mmol/L
ABDNAZ for 2 hours in a hypoxia chamber and then irradiated.
As expected, ABDNAZ increased the radiation sensitivity of

www.aacrjournals.org

radioresistant hypoxic cells and reduced their radiation survival to levels close to that observed under normoxia (Fig. 5B).
Meanwhile, the radiosensitivity of normoxic cells was also
enhanced by ABDNAZ, albeit to a lesser degree than observed
under hypoxia. The DMFs of ABDNAZ at 10% survival were 1.6
and 1.9 for normoxia and hypoxia, respectively, suggesting that
ABDNAZ more preferentially radiosensitized SCC VII tumor
cells under hypoxia.
The level of intracellular ROS in HT29 cells and SCC VII cells
was also increased in a dose-dependent manner following
exposure to ABDNAZ and radiation (Fig. 5C). ABDNAZ (1–
100 mmol/L) alone and radiation (2–10 Gy) alone induced ROS
generation in these cells. When used in combination, the levels
of ROS were signiﬁcantly higher than that observed with either
ABDNAZ alone or radiation alone (P < 0.01).
We then studied the in vivo therapeutic efﬁcacy of combining ABDNAZ with radiotherapy. Tumor-bearing mice were
treated with either 5 mg/kg ABDNAZ i.p. daily for 5 days, or
local tumor radiation of 250 cGy daily for 5 days, or both
ABDNAZ and radiation. Results showed that either radiation
alone or ABDNAZ alone inhibited tumor growth and produced
TGD times of 3.2  1.8 days and 1.8  0.6 days, respectively (P <
0.01, compared with untreated control; Fig. 6A). The combination treatment of radiation and ABDNAZ resulted in a TGD
time of 7.0  2.1 days (P < 0.01 vs. ABDNAZ or radiation alone).
We also studied the effect of using higher daily doses of
radiation (400 cGy) and ABDNAZ (6 mg/kg; Fig. 6B). Again,
ABDNAZ was able to enhance the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
radiotherapy and prolong the TGD time from 7.9  2.4 days
for radiation alone to 13.9  1.9 days for combination therapy
(P < 0.01 vs. ABDNAZ alone or radiation alone). All of the
combination regimens did not cause a signiﬁcant decrease in
animal body weight compared with untreated control mice or
radiation-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To optimize the treatment regimen, we studied the sequence
and timing effects of administration of ABDNAZ with
radiation. Figure 6C graphically shows the effect of sequence
and timing between administration of ABDNAZ (10 mg/kg)
and radiation (7Gy) on TGD time. Results showed that the
synergistic antitumor effect of combining ABDNAZ with radiation was sequence- and time-dependent. The maximum TGD
occurred when ABDNAZ was given 0 to 2 hours before radiation, with 4x TGD times of 4.5-4.0 days for ABDNAZ given 0 to
2 hours before radiation compared with 2.8 to 3.3 days for
ABDNAZ given at 2 or 24 hours after radiation (P < 0.05).
Because the metabolism of ABDNAZ involves the loss of
nitro groups leading to the formation of nitric oxide (NO;
ref. 23), experiments were carried out to determine whether the
observed radiosensitization effect of ABDNAZ could be due, in
part, to changes in tumor blood ﬂow arising from the effect of
nitric oxide on blood vessels in tumors. We therefore measured
the blood perfusion rate and blood volume in tumors before
and after treatment with ABDNAZ by microbubble-enhanced
ultrasound imaging. Results showed that treatment with ABDNAZ either alone (Fig. 7A) or in combination with radiation
(Fig. 7B) dramatically increased the rates of blood perfusion
and blood volume of SCC VII tumors in a dose- and timedependent manner. The microbubble signals peaked 6 hours

ABDNAZ did not increase radiation-induced myelosuppression (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Gastrointestinal toxicity caused by radiation limits the therapeutic dose that can be used for treating abdominal and pelvic
tumors with radiotherapy. Therefore, we conducted experiments to study the effect of ABDNAZ on intestinal crypt survival
following a TBI. Results showed that administration of ABDNAZ did not increase the TBI radiation–induced cell killing of
crypt stem cells in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Rather, it
actually protected the crypt cells against TBI and increased the
number of viable crypt cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Toxicity study
Detailed preclinical toxicity studies of ABDNAZ in mice, rats,
and dogs will be reported elsewhere. Brieﬂy, we found that the
maximum tolerated dose in mice was 10 to 12 mg/kg for a
single-dose i.v. bolus injection and 15 to 20 mg/kg for a singledose i.p. injection. A daily i.p. dose of 6 mg/kg for 14 days was
well-tolerated and there were no unexpected deaths, and no
obvious change in the general appearance, skin reaction, or
daily activity of mice. Cumulative toxicity was not observed.
There were no signs of myelosuppression following a 15 mg/kg

ABDNAZ, a Novel Anticancer Agent from Energetic Materials

pharmaceutical applications. In an aerospace setting, compounds containing this energetic functionality, such as trinitroazetidine, are designed to fragment explosively (14, 24).
Modiﬁcation of this structure resulted in ABDNAZ, a nonexplosive, selectively activated compound with the potential for
use in the treatment of cancer (15).
The preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies reported herein
show that ABDNAZ administered as a single agent is cytotoxic
for a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines in vitro and has
efﬁcacy for inhibiting growth of established tumors in vivo. The
IC50 dose of ABDNAZ is similar to that of cisplatin under
normoxia. However, ABDNAZ is more cytotoxic under hypoxic
conditions to tumor cells than both cisplatin and the bioreductive cytotoxin tirapazamine. ABDNAZ efﬁciently radiosensitizes tumor cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in vitro. Studies in tumor-bearing mice showed that
ABDNAZ effectively inhibits tumor growth without causing
systemic toxicity. When combined with conventional radiation
therapy, ABDNAZ enhanced the radiation response of tumors
and signiﬁcantly improved the therapeutic index. ABDNAZ
can be administered daily, every other day, or weekly by i.v.
or i.p. injection, or oral administration. ABDNAZ is well
tolerated, is not myelosuppressive, has no effect on hepatic
or renal function, and has no apparent dose-limiting toxicity
when administered daily for 14 days. Our data show that
ABDNAZ is a promising novel anticancer drug with a very
favorable toxicity proﬁle that is efﬁcacious in preclinical tumor
models as a stand-alone chemotherapeutical agent and as a
radiosensitizer.
The mechanism of action of ABDNAZ has not been fully
elucidated and is the subject of ongoing studies. Our current
results reported here show that ABDNAZ induced intracellular
ROS generation and increased the expression of the DNA
damage marker gH2AX in tumor cells in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. Modulation of intracellular redox
status with the GSH precursor NAC or the GSH synthesis
inhibitor BSO signiﬁcantly affected the magnitude of ABDNAZ-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, suggesting that the
ROS generation is one of the underlying mechanisms by which
ABDNAZ exhibits its cytotoxic antiproliferative effect on
tumor cells. Our data also show that combined use of ABDNAZ
and radiation augmented the generation of ROS and apoptosis.
Because ionizing irradiation produces free radicals mainly via
indirectly ionizing reactions with water molecules, combined
use of ABDNAZ and radiation could act synergistically through
different mechanisms and pathways to produce enhanced
levels of cytotoxic free radicals.
Our preliminary data suggest that ABDNAZ also results in
nitric oxide release via decomposition of conjugates formed in
vivo, which has effects on tumors as well. We have recently
reported that after i.v. administration, ABDNAZ binds rapidly
to hemoglobin and GSH, decomposing ultimately to soluble
metabolites in the blood (23). The major soluble metabolites
are the GSH and cysteine adducts. In addition, species derived
from ABDNAZ that had released one or both nitro groups were
detected by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry or by
proteomic studies, suggesting that ABDNAZ itself might act as
an NO donor. These ﬁndings well explain the results from our

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor-imaging studies that ABDNAZ markedly increased
regional blood perfusion and blood volume in tumors. NO is
an active cellular signaling molecule and well known as the
endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The blood vessel
endothelium uses NO to signal the surrounding smooth muscle
to relax, thus resulting in vasodilation effect and increasing
blood ﬂow in tissues. Taken together, these data support the
initial hypothesis that ABDNAZ releases NO radicals that affect
tumor blood ﬂow and would be expected to increase the
intratumoral concentration of ABDNAZ or its metabolites and
thereby enhance its therapeutic efﬁcacy. The effect of ABDNAZ
on blood perfusion could theoretically affect tumor oxygenation and will be investigated in the future.
Normal tissue toxicity and the presence of hypoxic cells in
human tumors are the principal reasons for the frequent failure
of radiotherapy to cure or control cancer. An ideal radiosensitizer should enhance the effect of radiation on tumors
and sensitize the hypoxic tumor cells without sensitizing
normal tissues to radiation or adding other toxicity to the
treatment regimen. Such an agent has yet to be identiﬁed and
to date there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administrationapproved radiosensitizers for clinical use. Results obtained
with the radiosensitizing compounds in clinical trials have
been discouraging in terms of their efﬁcacy and toxicity
proﬁles (25). Bioreductive agents, tirapazamine in particular,
have shown great promise preclinically and in early clinical
trials, results from phase III trials have been disappointing and
conﬂicting, in part, due to suboptimal tumor penetration and
activation outside of the targeted hypoxic regions of tumors
(12, 26). Several chemotherapeutic agents have been used to
enhance the effect of radiation therapy (27, 28). However, these
drugs have overlapping toxicities and can signiﬁcantly augment radiation effects in normal tissues. In addition, these
chemotherapeutic drugs do not have selective activity against
hypoxic tumor cells. Because ABDNAZ has activity under both
normoxic and hypoxic conditions, this drug has promising
potential for the treatment of a variety of cancers either as a
stand-alone single agent or in combination with radiation
therapy. Furthermore, ABDNAZ did not sensitize normal
tissue, such as intestinal crypt stem cells, to radiation and has
a favorable toxicity proﬁle at therapeutic doses. The efﬁcacy
and toxicity proﬁle of ABDNAZ warrant further investigation
and development as a novel anticancer agent.
