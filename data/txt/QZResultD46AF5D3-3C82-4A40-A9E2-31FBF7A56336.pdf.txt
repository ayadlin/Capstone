ABSTRACT
Metformin and aspirin have been studied extensively as cancer preventive or
therapeutic agents. However, the effects of their combination on pancreatic cancer
cells have not been investigated. Herein, we evaluated the effects of metformin and
aspirin, alone or in combination, on cell viability, migration, and apoptosis as well as
the molecular changes in mTOR, STAT3 and apoptotic signaling pathways in PANC-1
and BxPC3 cells. Metformin and aspirin, at relatively low concentrations, demonstrated
synergistically inhibitory effects on cell viability. Compared to the untreated control
or individual drug, the combination of metformin and aspirin significantly inhibited
cell migration and colony formation of both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. Metformin
combined with aspirin significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR and STAT3,
and induced apoptosis as measured by caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Remarkably,
metformin combined with aspirin significantly downregulated the anti-apoptotic
proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, and upregulated the pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma,
as well as interrupted their interactions. The downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 was
independent of AMPK or STAT3 pathway but partially through mTOR signaling and
proteasome degradation. In a PANC-1 xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that
the combination of metformin and aspirin significantly inhibited tumor growth and
downregulated the protein expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in tumors. Taken together,
the combination of metformin and aspirin significantly inhibited pancreatic cancer
cell growth in vitro and in vivo by regulating the pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members, supporting the continued investigation of this two drug combination as
chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents for pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

study found that diabetic patients who received metformin
had a significant lower risk of pancreatic cancer (odds
ratio = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.22–0.69; P = 0.001) comparing to
those who did not, while insulin administration caused a
higher risk of pancreatic cancer [1]. In a clinic-based casecontrol study involving 904 pancreatic cancer patients

Metformin and aspirin, two emerging candidate
drugs of cancer chemoprevention, have been reported to
decrease the risk of different types of cancers, including
pancreatic cancer [1-6]. For example, a large case-control

and 1224 controls, Tan et al. showed that aspirin use for
1 day per month or more frequently was associated with
a significantly decreased risk of pancreatic cancer (odds
ratio = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60–0.91, P = 0.005) compared
with never or less than 1 day per month [5]. In a pooled
analysis of 25,570 patients in eight trials, Rothwell et al.
recently reported that daily aspirin use reduced deaths
due to several common cancers, including significant
reductions in colorectal and pancreatic cancer deaths,
with most benefit seen after 5 years of the scheduled
trial treatment [7]. These investigations suggest that both
metformin and aspirin have preventive effects against the
development of pancreatic cancer.
In preclinical studies, metformin has been found
to inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion in
pancreatic cancer cells [8-10]. Metformin has also been
shown to prevent the promotional effect of high-fat diet
on N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP)-induced
pancreatic carcinogenesis in Syrian hamsters [11] and
to inhibit the pancreatic cancer cell growth in xenograft
models using athymic nude mice [10, 12, 13]. A recent
study reported that metformin prevents the progression of
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) to pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by targeting cancer stem
cells and mTOR signaling in p48Cre/+.LSL-KrasG12D/+
transgenic mice [14]. Tan et al. also recently showed that
metformin treatment may inhibit pancreatic tumorigenesis
in the LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53F2-10 mice by modulating
multiple molecular targets in signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor
kappa B (NFкB) inflammatory pathways [15]. Aspirin has
been shown to suppress pancreatic cancer growth both in
vitro and in vivo [16, 17]. Besides, a derivative of aspirin,
nitric oxide–donating aspirin (NO-ASA), also showed
chemopreventive effect in pancreatic cancer cell lines [18]
and transgenic mice models [19].
Interestingly, metformin and aspirin have been found
to share several underlying mechanisms on these protective
effects. At the cellular level, metformin stimulates AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) activation by disrupting
mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and decreasing
the ATP synthesis [20]. Recently, aspirin was also shown
to inhibit the dephosphorylation of AMPK thus activating
AMPK [21, 22]. AMPK maintains energy homeostasis by
blocking protein synthesis and cell proliferation through
inhibition of mTORC, which plays a pivotal role in cell
survival and regulation of metabolism [23]. Metformin
and aspirin can inhibit the mTOR signaling pathway
through both AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent
mechanisms [21, 24, 25]. Given that persistent low-grade
inflammation is an important factor for the development
of pancreatic cancer, it is worth noting that two major
inflammatory mediators, STAT3 and NFкB, also can
be suppressed by metformin and aspirin [26-30]. These
reported actions suggest possible better benefits in cancer
prevention by using the combination of metformin and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

aspirin. However, this interesting possibility in pancreatic
cancer has not been investigated.
Apoptotic cell death is tightly regulated by Bcl2 family protein members. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, bind to their
pro-apoptotic relatives and neutralize their pro-apoptotic
activity [31]. Of the BH3-only proteins, Bim and Puma
are the least selective, binding to all five anti-apoptotic
proteins [32]. Cancer cells evolve diverse strategies to
evade apoptosis by disturbing the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway. They can achieve this goal by increasing the
expression level of anti-apoptotic regulators such as Bcl2 and Mcl-1, or downregulating pro-apoptotic proteins
such as Bim and Puma [33]. Several Bcl-2 inhibitors
have shown efficacy as chemotherapy agents in clinical
trials [34]. However, there are some cancers that cannot
be treated with these Bcl-2 inhibitors, in which the
upregulation of Mcl-1 may play a key role [32]. Both
metformin and aspirin can induce apoptosis in different
cancer cells, including pancreatic cancer cells [9, 35-43].
However, the molecular mechanism for the apoptosis
induced by metformin or aspirin has not yet been clearly
elucidated.
In this study, we evaluated the effects of metformin
and aspirin on cell viability, migration, and apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and BxPC3. We found
that metformin combined with aspirin, at relatively low
concentrations, demonstrated a synergistic effect on cell
proliferation. Compared to the individual drug, we also
found that the combination of metformin and aspirin had
significantly stronger effects on the inhibition of colony
formation and cell migration, as well as the modulation
of the key molecular targets in AMPK, mTOR, STAT3
and NFкB pathways. Furthermore, the combination
of metformin and aspirin led to apoptosis through
downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl2 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and
Puma. We also showed that the downregulation of Mcl-1
and Bcl-2 was independent of AMPK or STAT3 pathway
but partially through mTOR signaling and proteasome
degradation. In a PANC-1 xenograft mouse model,
we demonstrated that the combination of metformin
and aspirin significantly inhibited tumor growth and
downregulated the protein expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2
in tumors. These data provide rationale and experimental
evidence for the combined use of metformin and aspirin
in the prevention and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer.

doses of metformin and aspirin in PANC-1 and BxPC-3
cells. We observed that the combination of metformin and
aspirin caused a synergistic inhibition of cell viability in
both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, mainly in low dosages
of both drugs [e.g., PANC-1 cells: 5 mM metformin and
2 mM aspirin, and 10 mM metformin and 4 mM aspirin
(P for the test of synergy = 0.034 and 0.007, respectively);

PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells were treated with metformin and aspirin at indicated concentrations for 72 hours. Cell viability was evaluated
by MTS assay. For colony formation assay, the treated and untreated cells were trypsinized and 1000 single viable cells were plated in
6-well plates and culture for additional 14 days. The colonies were stained with MTT and counted if they contain 50 cells or more. For
wound-healing assay, cells were seeded in 12-well plates, and the wound was generated by scratching the surface of the plates with a pipette
tip. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with metformin and aspirin at indicated concentration for 18 hours. Data are means ±

then tested the effects of metformin and aspirin on colony
formation of PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. The combination
of metformin and aspirin significantly decreased the
colonogenicity to about 20% compared to the control in
both cell lines (Figure 1B). Furthermore, in anchorageindependent colony formation assay, metformin or aspirin
alone could effectively inhibit the formation of colonies at
dose of 5 mM or 2 mM, respectively, and this inhibition

was even greater in cells treated with the combination of
metformin and aspirin (Supplementary Figure S1). We
also examined the effect of metformin and aspirin on cell
migration by wound-healing assay, and observed that the
combination metformin and aspirin acted more efficiently
to inhibit the capacity of wound healing in both cell lines
(Figure 1C).

The effects of metformin and aspirin on different
signaling pathways

Metformin and aspirin induced apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cells

To further investigate the mechanism responsible for
the effects of the combination of metformin and aspirin,
we evaluated the effects of metformin and aspirin on the
expression and activation of selected signaling pathways.
We first examined the effects of both drugs individually
in PANC-1 cells on AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC), which is a well-established AMPK downstream
targeting enzyme [21]. The results showed that both
metformin and aspirin could individually stimulate the
phosphorylation of AMPK, especially on early time point
(8 h) (Figure 2A, left panel). The activation of AMPK
was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of
ACC, which was continued to 48 h. When the cells were
treated by the combination of metformin and aspirin, the
phosphorylation of ACC was further erected (Figure 2A,
right panel).
Since AMPK is a major regulator of mTOR pathway,
we also examined the effects of metformin and aspirin
on mTOR and its downstream targets, the ribosomal
protein S6 kinase (S6K) and the eukaryotic initiation
factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) in PANC-1 cells.
Previous studies had demonstrated that both metformin
and aspirin could inhibit the activity of mTORC1 [21,
24]. Consistent with those results, we also observed that
treatment of metformin or aspirin led to a time-dependent
decrease of the phosphorylation level of mTORC1
(Figure 2B, left panel). Furthermore, metformin or aspirin
showed a strong inhibition of the phosphorylation of S6K.
We also examined the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and
detected three isoforms of 4E-BP1, which correspond
to differentially phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 [44].
The slowest migrating band γ represents the hyperphosphorylated form and the fastest migrating band α
represents the hypo-phosphorylated form of the protein.
Metformin or aspirin treatment caused a remarkable shift
from the γ form to the α form, indicating a decrease of
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Interestingly, the combination
of metformin and aspirin showed stronger inhibition of the
phosphorylation of mTOR, S6K and 4E-BP1, compared to
the single agent (Figure 2B, right panel).
We then assessed the effects of metformin and
aspirin on NFкB and STAT3 pathways in PANC-1
cells. Metformin and aspirin individually suppressed the
phosphorylation of NFкB and STAT3 in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 2C, 2D). Compared to a single agent, the
combination of metformin and aspirin exerted a more
pronounced effect on the suppression of NFкB (Figure
2C, right panel) and STAT3 (Figure 2D, right panel).
These results showed that the combination of metformin
and aspirin had significantly stronger effects on the above
signaling pathways in PANC-1 cells, compared to the
single agents.

To define the type of cell death induced by
metformin and aspirin, we assessed the apoptotic cell
death in BxPC-3 cells by flow cytometry using co-staining
of Annexin-V and Propidium Iodide. Compared to the
untreated control, treatment with metformin or aspirin
induced a marginal to mediate increase of apoptotic cells
(14.23% vs. 12.56%; 12.66% vs. 12.56%, respectively),
and the combination of metformin and aspirin significantly
increased the number of apoptotic cells (23.72%), as
compared to the untreated control or individual drug
(Figure 3A). We also determined the cleavage of
caspase-3 and PARP, which are the hallmarks of apoptosis.
Metformin alone induced a slight proteolytic cleavage
of caspase-3 in PANC-1 cells, while the combination of
metformin and aspirin significantly induced the cleavage
of caspase-3 and PARP (Figure 3B, left panel). Similar
results were also observed in BxPC-3 cells (Figure 3B,
right panel).

The effects of metformin and aspirin on antiapoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins
To further explore the mechanism of the apoptosis
induced by metformin and aspirin, we investigated the
protein levels of the Bcl-2 family members. We first
examined the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and
Bcl-xL in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. The protein levels of
Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 decreased in the cells treated with either
metformin or aspirin, and these effects were significantly
stronger in the cells treated with the combination
of metformin and aspirin (Figure 3C). However, no
significant change on the protein level of Bcl-xL was
observed when the cells were treated with metformin and
aspirin alone or a combination. We also determined the
protein levels of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members,
including Bim, Puma, Bak, Bax, Bid and Bad, and most
of them did not show significant changes (Figure 3D).
However, the combination of metformin and aspirin
significantly increased all the three isoforms of Bim in
PANC-1 cells (Figure 3D, left panel) and Puma in BxPC3
cells (Figure 3D, right panel). These results suggested
that the downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, and the
upregulation of Bim and Puma may be involved in the
apoptosis induced by metformin and aspirin in pancreatic
cancer cells.

The effects of metformin and aspirin are
independent of AMPK and STAT3
To examine whether the downregulation of Mcl1 and Bcl-2 is dependent on AMPK, we knocked down

After AMPKα was silenced, we still observed the
downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 induced by metformin

and aspirin, indicating that the inhibitory effect of
metformin and aspirin on Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 is independent
of the activity of AMPK. We observed that both metformin

and aspirin significantly inhibited the activity of STAT3,
and STAT3 was previously showed to regulate Mcl1 and Bcl-2 in various cancer cell lines [35, 45, 46].
Therefore, we determined whether metformin and aspirin
regulated Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 through STAT3 inhibition. In
our experiment, knockdown of STAT3 did not alter the
protein levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, and metformin and
aspirin could still decrease Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 protein levels
in the siRNA transfected STAT3-silenced PANC-1 cells
(Figure 4B). Furthermore, we assessed the cell viability in
AMPKα or STAT3 knockdown cells upon metformin and
aspirin treatment (Figure 4C). Compared to the control,
knockdown of AMPKα or STAT3 has no significant effect
on the inhibition of cell viability by metformin and aspirin.
These results suggested that the inhibitory effects of
metformin and aspirin on cell proliferation and the protein
expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 are independent of AMPK
and STAT3 in PANC-1 cells.
To further evaluate the role of STAT3 in the

regulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, we examined whether
IL-6, a STAT3 activator, could revert the downregulation
of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in the BxPC3 cells treated with
metformin and/or aspirin. We observed that IL-6 alone
significantly induced the phosphorylation of STAT3, but
could not induce the protein expression of Mcl-1 and
Bcl-2 (Figure 4D). In addition, the inhibitory effects of
metformin and aspirin on the protein expression of Mcl-1
and Bcl-2 in BxPC3 cells could not be compensated when
the cells were simultaneously treated with IL-6 (Figure
4D). These results further suggested that the inhibitory
effect of metformin and aspirin on Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 is
independent of STAT3 inhibition.

Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2 (Figure 5A). The results suggest that
the downregulation of Mcl-1 by metformin and aspirin
is through proteasome degradation, and the different
mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of Mcl-1
and Bcl-2 by metformin and aspirin.
Mcl-1 has also been reported to be transcriptional
regulated by mTORC1 [48], therefore, we determined
whether the regulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 by metformin
and aspirin is dependent on the mTORC1 activity. We
observed that AZD8055, a mTORC1 inhibitor, induced

a comparable reduction of the phosphorylation of S6K,
resulting in inhibition of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression
(Figure 5B). However, AZD8055 could not further
enhance the downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 induced
by metformin and aspirin (Figure 5B). These results
indicated that metformin and aspirin may regulate the
expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 partially through mTOR
pathway.

Figure 7: The combination of metformin and aspirin inhibited tumor growth and downregulated the protein expression
of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in a PANC-1 xenograft mouse model. (A) The combination of metformin and aspirin significantly inhibited

pancreatic tumor growth. 2 × 106 PANC-1 cells suspended in 50% Matrigel in DMEM medium were injected subcutaneously into the right

(5 μL/g body weight), metformin (200 mg/kg), aspirin (60 mg/kg), or metformin (200 mg/kg) plus aspirin (60 mg/kg) three times a week
for 28 days (n = 10 per group). The tumor size (length and width) was measured before each i.p. injection and tumor volume was calculated

The combination of metformin and aspirin
disrupted the balance between Mcl-1 and Bim/
Puma

growth for the combination of metformin and aspirin was
significantly different from that for any other groups (P ≤
0.02). At the last time point (Day 28) when the mice was
sacrificed, the mean ± standard error (SE) for the percent
of initial tumor volume was 377.2 ± 29.8% for the vehicle
treated control group, 307.3 ± 30.2% for the aspirin
alone, 249.2 ± 20.5% for the metformin alone, 153.4 ±
17.6% for the combination of metformin and aspirin.
The percent of initial tumor volume at the last time point
for the combination group was statistically significantly
lower than that for any other groups after the Tukey’s
multiplicity adjustments (Comb vs. Cont: P < 0.0001,
Comb vs. Asp: P = 0.0006, Comb vs. Met: P = 0.049)
(Figure 7A). No statistically significant difference in the
percent of initial body weight between the control group
and any of the treatment groups was observed during the
experiments (Supplementary Figure S3).
Furthermore, we determined the protein expression
of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in the mice tumors, and demonstrated
that the combination of metformin and aspirin significantly
decreased the protein levels of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in
vivo (Figure 7B). However, we did not detect significant
changes on Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 protein expression in the mice
treated with metformin or aspirin alone (Figure 7B).

To further elucidate the mechanism by which the
combination of metformin and aspirin induced apoptosis,
we performed immunoprecipitation to examine the
interaction of Mcl-1 with Bim in PANC-1 cells and Puma
in BXPC-3 cells. We first immunoprecipitated endogenous
Mcl-1 protein from these cells and determined its binding
to Bim using anti-Bim antibody. We observed that BimEL or Bim-S that binding to Mcl-1 significantly decreased
after the treatment of metformin and aspirin (Figure 6A).
Similar effects of metformin and aspirin on the interaction
between Mcl-1 and Puma were also observed in BxPC3
cells (Figure 6B). Since the Mcl-1 protein expression
significantly decreased in the cells treated with metformin
and aspirin, we could not exclude the possibility that the
decreases of Bim and Puma levels were due to the downregulation of Mcl-1. To further clarify the treatment
effects on the interaction between Mcl-1 and Bim/
Puma, we performed the reverse immunoprecipitation
by immunoprecipitating endogenous Bim or Puma and
immunobloting with anti-Mcl-1 antibody. Although
the immunoprecipitated Bim or Puma in PANC-1 or
BxPC3 cells increased, the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1
interacting with them significantly decreased, indicating
an increase of free Bim or Puma which will lead to
apoptosis (Figure 6C, 6D). In addition, we observed that
metformin and aspirin could also decrease the interaction
between Bcl-2 and Puma in BxPC3 cells (Supplementary
Figure S2), but we were not able to detect the interaction
between Bcl-2 and Bim in PANC-1 cells (data not shown).
Furthermore, knockdown of Mcl-1 could sensitize the
PANC-1 cells to metformin and aspirin (Figure 6E),
indicating that the downregulation of Mcl-1 played a
pivotal role in the apoptosis induced by metformin and
aspirin alone or in combination.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed that metformin and
aspirin exhibited synergistic effect on the cell proliferation
inhibition. Compared to the individual agents, we
showed that the combination of metformin and aspirin
had significantly stronger effects on the inhibition of
colony formation and cell migration in PANC-1 and
BxPC-3 cells. These effects of metformin and aspirin
are independent of AMPK, which is a well-established
upstream target of metformin. Our results also showed
that metformin combined with aspirin could significantly
downregulate anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 and
upregulate pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma. The
immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that metformin
alone or combined with aspirin abrogated the interaction
between Mcl-1 and Bim corresponding to the increase
of Bim in PANC-1 cells and disrupted the interaction
between Mcl-1 and Puma corresponding to the increase
of Puma in BxPC3 cells. In a PANC-1 xenograft mouse
model, we further demonstrated that the combination
of metformin and aspirin significantly inhibited tumor
growth and downregulated the protein expression of Mcl1 and Bcl-2 in tumors. These results suggested that the
combination of metformin and aspirin could significantly
inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo
though suppressing anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and Bcl2, and increasing pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma,
as well as disrupting their interactions in pancreatic cancer
cells.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study

The combination of metformin and aspirin
inhibited the growth of PANC-1 xenograft tumors
in immunodeficient mice
The combination of metformin and aspirin had
a strong inhibitory effect on tumor growth, whereas
injection of aspirin alone had only a small inhibitory
effect on tumor growth, and administration of metformin
alone had a moderate inhibitory effect on tumor growth
(Figure 7A). The quadratic trends in tumor growth for all
the treatment groups were significantly different from the
vehicle control group (Asp vs. Cont: P = 0.009, Met vs.
Cont: P < 0.0001, Comb vs. Cont: P < 0.0001). The linear
trend for the metformin alone and aspirin alone were not
significantly different from the control group (P = 0.815
and 0.272, respectively), while the linear trend in tumor

to show that metformin combined with aspirin suppress
the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member
Mcl-1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Mcl-1 amplification is
one of the most common genetic aberrations observed
in human cancers, including pancreatic cancer [34,
47], indicating Mcl-1 plays a key role in pancreatic
tumorigenesis. Studies also showed that Mcl-1 highly
expressed in pancreatic cancer cells which was related to
the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs [49]. In vitro, we
observed that the protein level of Mcl-1 was reduced by
either metformin or aspirin and the combination of two
drugs further decreased the Mcl-1 protein level. Since
Mcl-1 is strongly regulated by proteasome degradation,
we compared the effects of metformin and aspirin in the
absence and presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132.
Our results showed that metformin and aspirin failed to
decrease Mcl-1 protein level in the presence of MG132,
indicating that metformin and aspirin induced proteasome
degradation of Mcl-1. In contrast, MG132 failed to rescue
the reduction of Bcl-2 induced by metformin and aspirin.
These findings imply that metformin and aspirin regulate
the expression level of Mcl-1 (but not Bcl-2) partially
through proteasome degradation.
The mTOR signaling pathway has been reported to
regulate Mcl-1 at both transcriptional and translational
levels [48, 50]. mTOR also can indirectly regulate
proteasome degradation of Mcl-1 by repressing GSK3
[51]. . In our study, AZD8055, an mTOR inhibitor,
significantly decreased the phosphorylation of S6K,
resulting in repression of the expression of Mcl-1 in the
two pancreatic cancer cell lines. However, AZD8055 could
not further enhance the downregulation of Mcl-1 induced
by metformin and aspirin. These results suggest that the
regulation of Mcl-1by metformin and aspirin are at least
partially through mTOR pathway. Given that metformin
and aspirin could downregulate Mcl-1 through protein
degradation (Figure 5A), it is also possible that mTOR
might partially contribute to the proteasome-dependent
degradation of Mcl-1 induced by metformin and aspirin.
To the best of our knowledge, we found, for the first time,
that the expression of Bcl-2 was downregulated upon
AZD8055 treatment, raising the possibility that Bcl-2 is
also regulated by mTOR. More studies are warranted to
determine whether and how mTOR regulates Bcl-2 at
transcription or translational level.
AMPK has been shown to be a main mediator
of metformin in various cancer cell lines. In our study,
although AMPK could be activated by both metformin
and aspirin, which is consistent with other previous
reports, AMPK activation is not indispensable for the
anti-proliferation effect of metformin and aspirin. When
AMPKα was silenced by specific siRNA, the survival
curves of the cells treated by metformin, aspirin or
the combination did not show significant difference.
Furthermore, the downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 by
metformin and aspirin were still observed in the absence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of AMPKα, indicating that the regulation of Mcl-1 and
Bcl-2 by metformin and aspirin is independent of AMPK
activation.
STAT3 is a key player in inflammation-related
tumorigenesis, including pancreatic cancer, by promoting
tumor cell proliferation and survival [46]. We observed
that metformin and aspirin significantly inhibited the
phosphorylation of STAT3 in PANC-1 and BxPC-3
cells. This is consistent with the previous findings that
both metformin and aspirin inhibited the transcriptional
activation of STAT3 in various cancer cell lines [26-28,
35, 52-54]. However, in our study, knockdown of STAT3
did not change the sensitivity of the cells to metformin
and aspirin. Moreover, the protein levels of Mcl-1 or Bcl2 did not change in STAT3-silenced cells. These results
suggest that the inhibition of STAT3 is not involved in
the proliferation inhibitory effect or the downregulation of
Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 induced by metformin and aspirin in the
studied pancreatic cancer cells.
We found that metformin and aspirin-induced
apoptosis is mediated by the downregulation of
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, the
upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim
and Puma as well as the interruption of their interactions.
Mcl-1 contributes to oncogenesis by both promoting
apoptotic resistance and supporting high-rate proliferation
of cancer cells, which makes it a critical molecule in
cancer initiation and progression [32, 47]. Consistent
with this, inhibition of Mcl-1 by siRNA sensitized PANC1 cells to metformin and aspirin, further emphasizing
the important role of Mcl-1 in metformin and aspirininduced apoptosis. Among BH3-only proteins, Bim and
Puma would be more efficient because of their ability
to potently bind all the antiapoptotic proteins of Bcl-2
family, including Mcl-1[33]. After the PANC-1 cells were
treated with metformin and aspirin, the protein levels of
Bim were increased, and the interaction between Mcl-1
and Bim/Puma was decreased. In BxPC-3 cells, we also
observed that metformin and aspirin increased the protein
level of Puma and abrogated the interaction between Puma
and Mcl-1. These results are consistent with the idea that
that particular BH3-only proteins drive the responses
to specific cytotoxic insults, with Bim and Puma often
being essential [31]. Increased levels of Puma and Bim
may initiate apoptosis through the activation of Bax and
Bak [55]. We did not find the upregulation of Bax and
Bak after the treatment with metformin and aspirin, but
more evidence are needed to determine whether Bax and
Bak are activated in pancreatic cancer cells treated with
metformin and aspirin.
In this study, we evaluated, for the first time, the
effects of the combination of metformin and aspirin at
relatively low concentrations in pancreatic cancer cell
lines. The published in vitro studies on anti-cancer effects
of metformin had used the dosages of metformin ranged
from 1 mM to 50 mM. Although the doses of metformin
21219

we used is still higher than the physiologically achievable
plasma concentration, metformin has been reported
to accumulate within tissues at concentrations several
folds higher than in blood [56]. In addition, metformin
was also reported to accumulate in the mitochondrial
matrix with a concentration higher than 20 mM due to
the positive mitochondrial membrane potential [57, 58].
The plasma salicylate (the in vivo metabolite of aspirin)
concentrations in human are 1~2 mM, which is similar
with the concentrations we used in vitro.
Furthermore, we utilized a PANC-1 xenograft model
to determine the effects of the combination of metformin
and aspirin at physiologically achievable concentrations
(the human equivalent doses of 416.9 mg/day and 125
mg/day for metformin and aspirin, respectively) on
tumor growth. The results showed that the combination
had significantly stronger effects on the inhibition of
the pancreatic tumor growth than the individual agent.
Additionally, the combination of metformin and aspirin
significantly suppressed the protein expression of Mcl1 and Bcl-2 in tumors, while no significant changes on
Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 protein expression were observed in
the mice treated with metformin or aspirin alone. These
data suggested that the combination of metformin and
aspirin within therapeutic dose range had better benefits
on inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell growth, compared
to metformin or aspirin alone, indicating a novel approach
for pancreatic cancer prevention using the combination of
metformin and aspirin.
In conclusion, the combination of metformin and
aspirin exert synergistic cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer
cell lines and significantly inhibitory effect on in vivo
tumor growth by inducing apoptotic cell death through
the downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member
Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, and the upregulation/activation of the
pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma. It is of
interest to explore the possibility of using the combination
of the two drugs to prevent the development of pancreatic
cancer. The ongoing clinical trials on metformin and
pancreatic cancer are focusing on assessing the efficacy of
metformin in combination with standard and experimental
therapeutics in advanced pancreatic cancer patients.
Our study provides a rationale for the potential clinical
trials that combine metformin with aspirin to assess
the preventive effect on pancreatic cancer in high-risk
population.

PBS to remove cell debris and incubated with indicated
agents (5 mM metformin, 2 mM aspirin for PANC-1
cells; 3 mM metformin, 1 mM aspirin for BxPC-3 cells)
for 18 hours and then photographed with phase-contrast
microscope. The migrated distance for each group was
measured and statistically analyzed.

Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The siRNA
transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 hours, the transfected
cells were treated with metformin and aspirin, alone or in
combination for additional 72 hours. Cell viability assay
and Western blotting were performed as described above
to determine the effects of metformin and aspirin on cell
proliferation and specific molecular changes, respectively.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was determined by using an Annexin
V-FITC/ PI apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Briefly,
the untreated and treated cells were washed with PBS
buffer and gently suspended in Annexin V binding buffer
and incubated with Annexin V-FITC (20 μg/mL) and PI
(20 μg/mL) for 15 minutes in the dark. Flow cytometry
analysis was performed using Cellquest software.

Protein immunoprecipitation
After indicated treatments, cells were collected
and lysed in cell lysis buffer with protease inhibitor
cocktail on ice. 20 μL of protein A/G sepharose beads
and 1 μg indicated antibody were added to the cell lysates
containing 500 μg total proteins. Following overnight
incubation with gentle rocking at 4°C, the beads were
washed with PBS buffer for 4 times and analyzed by
Western blotting.

Western blotting
The treated and untreated cells were rinsed twice
with ice-cold PBS and extracted on ice with cell lysis
buffer (Cell signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) which contains
20 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2.5 mM Na
pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 µg/mL
leupeptin and 1 mM PMSF. The protein concentrations
of lysates are determined with BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). A stock of
the extract was made in 1 × Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) and stored at -20°C for western blot
analysis. 20 μg of total proteins from each sample were
loaded and separated on a gradient 4-20% polyacrylamide
gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free
milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST, 20mM Tris,
pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hour at
room temperature, followed by an overnight incubation at
4°C with the primary antibodies. Blots were subsequently
washed three times with TBST and then incubated with
the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for
1 hour at room temperature. After three additional TBST
washes, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher, Rockford,
IL USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The levels of β-actin were estimated to check for equal
samples loading. Films were scanned and band densities
were quantified with densitometric analysis using ImageJ
software (NIH).

In vivo experiments
Female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)
mice (6–7 weeks old) were obtained from Taconic Farms
Inc (Germantown, NY, USA). The animals were housed in
sterile filter-capped microisolator cages and provided with
sterilized food and water. PANC-1 cells (2×106 cells/0.1
mL/mouse) suspended in 50% Matrigel (Collaborative
Research, Bedford, MA) in DMEM medium were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the mice.
To determine suitable metformin and aspirin doses for our
study, we carefully reviewed the available data. Based
on our recent study [15] and other prior studies [10, 11,
59] we administrated metformin 200 mg/kg, and aspirin
60 mg/kg three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and
Friday) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. After 4–6
weeks, mice with PANC-1 tumors (0.5–1.0 cm wide
and 0.5–1.0 cm long) were randomized and injected by
i.p. with vehicle (5 μL/g body weight), metformin (200
mg/kg), aspirin (60 mg/kg), or metformin (200 mg/kg)
plus aspirin (60 mg/kg) three times a week for 28 days.
The mice in the different experimental groups received
the same amount of vehicle (5 μL/g body weight) which
consisted of propylene glycol, polysorbate 80, benzyl
alcohol, ethanol and water (40:0.5:1:10:48.5) (14). Tumor
size (length and width) and body weight were measured
before each i.p. injection. All animal experiments were
carried out under an Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC)-approved protocol.

The method by Laska et al [60], based on
isobologram, was used to assess the synergistic effects
of the combination of metformin with aspirin on cell
viability. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s test
was used for assessing the treatment effects on colony
information, cell migration, apoptosis, as well as the
modulations of protein expression. The tumor volume
was calculated by using the formula length × width ×
width/2. The analyses of percentage of initial tumor
volume were based on a repeated measurement model
[61]. The treatment effects were assessed by comparing
the rates of change over time between treatment groups
(i.e. comparing the slops and/or quadratic trends between
treatment groups). Heterogeneous autoregressive
correlation structure was used to account for the withinmice correlation. The ANOVA model with Tukey-Kramer
adjustment [62] was used for the comparison of tumor
volume and body weight among different treatment groups
at the end of the treatment. A P value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
