ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy resistance frequently drives tumor progression. Increased
expression of ST8SIA4 has been reported in diverse carcinomas and highly
correlates with leukemia multidrug resistance (MDR). MicroRNAs (miRNA) are
widely recognized as key players in cancer progression and drug resistance. Here,
to explore whether miRNA modulates the sensitivity of chronic myelocytic leukemia
(CML) to chemotherapeutic agents and regulates ST8SIA4 expression, we analyzed
the complete miRNA expression profile and found a subset of miRNAs specifically
dysregulated in adriamycin-resistant CML cell line K562/ADR and its parent cell line
K562. Compared with three pairs of CML cell lines and 38 clinical samples of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CML patients, miR-181c expression was downregulated in drug-resistant cell lines and CML/MDR samples. Altered expression levels
of miR-181c influenced the MDR phenotypes of K562 and K562/ADR. Reporter-gene
assay showed that miR-181c directly targeted and inhibited the ST8SIA4 expression,
as well as miR-181c was inversely correlated with the levels of ST8SIA4 expression in
CML cell lines and samples. Moreover, ST8SIA4 could reverse the effect of miR-181c
on drug resistance in K562 and K562/ADR cells in vitro. Upregulation of miR-181c
sensitized K562/ADR cells to adriamycin in vivo through directly suppressing ST8SIA4
expression. Further investigation showed that miR-181c mediated the activity of
phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signal pathway, and inhibition of PI3K/Akt
in K562 cells counteracted miR-181c-mediated MDR phenotype. These data revealed
an important role for miR-181c in the regulation of chemoresistance in CML, and
suggested the potential application of miR-181c in drug resistance treatment.

base pairing to partially or fully complementary
sites [2]. It has been demonstrated that miRNAmediated gene regulation was involved in multiple
biological processes, such as cell proliferation,
migration and invasion, differentiation, survival, and
tumorigenesis [3]. It has been reported that miRNAs
play important roles in chemotherapeutic resistance
[4], highlighting miRNAs as potent therapeutic targets
or chemoresistant modulators in cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a
myeloproliferative disorder characterized by BCRABL fusion gene [1]. Over the past two decades, major
advances have been achieved in the treatment of cancers
thanks to the highly potent antineoplastic drugs. However,
chemoresistance is still a significant obstacle for successful
chemotherapy of CML patients.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of regulatory
non-coding RNAs of 19-25 nucleotides which act
by targeting specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
for degradation or inhibition of translation through

apoptosis induced by imatinib in CML [6], and forced
expression of miR-217 sensitizes dasatinib-resistant
K562 cells to dasatinib [7]. More recently, miR-17 and
miR-20a have been demonstrated to be involved in
resistance of the leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic
drug VP-16 mediated by BIM-S [8].
Sialic acids are negatively charged nine-carbon
carboxylated monosaccharides on glycosylated
proteins and lipids formed due to post translational
modification [9]. Most cell surface glycans are highly
sialylated and often involved in cell-cell and/or cellextracellular matrix interaction [10]. High level of
ST3Gal III sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to Taxo [11].
Endogenous expression of ST6GalNAc I in CML cell
line K562 was associated with the expression of the STn
O-glycan related to a lack of response to chemotherapy
[12]. In many tumors, continued activation of
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway
has been implicated as a mechanism of resistance to
cytotoxic chemotherapy agents [13, 14]. ST8SIA4
has been reported to enhance the chemoresistance in
leukemia by phosphorylating and activating of Akt
at Ser473 and Thr308 specifically and increasing the
activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [15, 16].
By combining microarray analyses and real-time
PCR, we found that miR-181c levels remained low in
K562/ADR cells but became markedly higher in K562
cells. Other study has reported that upregulation of
miR-181c contributes to chemoresistance in pancreatic
cancer. Based on the above, we selected miR-181c for
analysis. By miRNA target prediction algorithms, and
experimental validation approaches, the objective of

this study was to reveal the molecular mechanisms of
miR-181c in adriamycin-resistant CML cancer.

RESULTS
MiRNA-181c is downregulated in chemoresistant
CML cell lines and CML/MDR patients
A screen to identify miRNAs involved in adriamycin
resistance was performed in K562 and K562/ADR cell
lines, which were made adriamycin-resistant by continuous
exposure to adriamycin in vitro. We identified 41 miRNAs
to be dysregulated at least 5-fold in resistant compared to
adriamycin sensitive parental cells (Table 1). Supervised
hierarchical clustering using the 41 differentially expressed
miRNAs clustered cell lines according to miRNA
expression rather than doxorubicin response (Figure 1A).
We found that miR-181c levels remained low in K562/
ADR cells but became markedly higher in K562 cells. We
further confirmed miR-181c expression using real-time
PCR. As shown in Figure 1B, the expressions of miR-181c
were decreased in K562/ADR, KU812/ADR, KCL22/ADR
cells. To identify the expression level of miR-181c in CML
patients, the PBMC isolated from CML patients was also
analyzed. The PBMC were first divided into two groups,
CML without MDR and CML/MDR. The frequency of
P-gp positivity was 57.9% (22 of 38) in the CML patients.
As shown in Figure 1C, miR-181c expression was increased
in CML patients compared with that in CML/MDR patients.
We hypothesized that miR-181c might functionally regulate
therapy response. We therefore focused on its role in
chemoresistance regulation.

MiR-181c signature impacts chemoresistance of

the expression of miR-181c (Figure 3A). Conversely,
transient transfection of miR-181c resulted in a significant
decrease in cell viability of K562/ADR cells to ADR,
VCR and Taxol (Figure 2B). Furthermore, overexpression
of miR-181c sensitized cells to chemotherapy, as
indicated by a decrease in the IC50 (Figure 3C).
Moreover, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that miR181c significantly increased the apoptosis of these cancer
cells upon drug treatments (Figure 3D). Collectively,
these results indicated that downregulation of miR-181c
promotes chronic myelocytic leukemia cell resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro.

The role of miR-181c in chemoresistance was
characterized by endogenously silencing miR-181c in
K562 cells. As shown in Figure 2B, transient transfection
of antagomiR-181c in K562 cell resulted in an increase
in cell viability to ADR, VCR and Taxol. Moreover,
increased IC50 values for chemotherapeutic agents were
observed, after downregulation of miR-181c (Figure
2C). In addition, flow cytometry analysis showed that
inhibition of miR-181c led to a decrease in the apoptosis
rate (Figure 2D). The role of miR-181c in chemoresistance
was further examined by upregulation of miR-181c. K562/
ADR cells were transiently transfected with miR-181c or
mimic control. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that the
transient transfection of miR-181c effectively enhanced

binding seed regions.
Forced miR-181c expression decreased luciferase
activity, and this suppression was reversed by the mutation
of the target sequences in the 3’-UTR of ST8SIA4
(Figure 4A). Western blotting analysis showed that the
inhibition of miR-181c increased ST8SIA4 expression
levels in K562 cells. Whereas, ectopic expression of
miR-181c by transient transfection decreased the protein
expression of ST8SIA4 in K562/ADR cells (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, analysis of miR-181c and ST8SIA4 expression
in CML patients by Spearman’s correlation analysis showed
a significant inverse correlation (r= –0.7355, P =0.000;
Figure 4C) Taken together, the results indicated that miR181c targets ST8SIA4 to repress its expression by binding
to 3’-UTR regions.

well-developed miRNA algorithms were employed, such
as TargetScan, PicTar, and miRNA.org, to obtain possible
mRNA targets of miR-181c. ABI1, ACSL1, APOO, BRAP,
BRD1, PLEK,SETX, RLF,ST8SIA4, DHX57, DOCK7,
ENPP1, FOS et al were among the potential targets.
Polysialylation of NCAM is implemented by the two
polysialyltransferases (polySTs) ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4.
Recently, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) also
has been implicated in the signalling events initiated by
NCAM [15]. ST8SIA4 seems to be the major polyST of
the adult brain [16]. Moreover, constitutive activation of
PI3K/Akt is associated with the expression of ST8SIA4
[17,18]. In addition, our previous study has demonstrated
it was involved in the development of multidrug resistance
in human leukemia [19, 20]. So, among the search results,
ST8SIA4 captured our attention.
Then, we investigated whether ST8SIA4 was a target
of miR-181c in CML cells. Luciferase reporter constructs
were made, containing the putative binding sites of

ST8SIA4 reverses the effect of miR-181cmediated chemoresistance in K562 and K562/
ADR cells

by sensitizing cells to chemotherapeutic agents [19].
These results suggested that ST8SIA4 is responsible for
mediating the effects of miR-181c on chemoresistance in
CML cell lines.

To assess the possible role of ST8SIA4 in the
chemoresistance-mediating capability of miR-181c,
we performed functional loss assays by co-transfecting
ST8SIA4-shRNA plasmid and antagomiR-181c in K562
cells. Western blotting analyses showed a decrease
of ST8SIA4 protein in antagomiR-181 transfected
clone (K562-antagomiR-181c) (Figure 5A), indicating
the effective inhibition of the wild-type protein.
While suppression of miR-181c expression promoted
chemoresistance, knockdown of ST8SIA4 reversed
antagomiR-181c-mediated sensitivity of the K562 cells
to ADR, VCR and Taxol (Figure 5B). Re-introducing
the wild-type form of ST8SIA4 in K562/ADR cells led
to a marked increase in the protein expression upon
transfection with the miR-181c compared to control
(Figure 5C). As shown in Figure 5D, while miR-181c
expression induced inhibitory effects on chemoresistance,
recombinantly expressed ST8SIA4 reversed miR181c-mediated sensitivity of K562/ADR cells to drug
treatment (Figure 5D). Equally important, knockdown of
ST8SIA4 copied the phenotype of high miR-181c levels

MiR-181c regulates chemoresistance via
ST8SIA4 dependent PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway
It has been reported that inhibition of PI3K/AKT
signaling has proven to be an efficient way to attenuate
the resistance of chemotherapy [36]. Our previous results
showed that PI3K/AKT pathway is activated in K562/
ADR cells compared with its parental cells K562, and
ST8SIA4 was positive regulators of PI3K/AKT pathway.
In present study, given that the expression of ST8SIA4
was down-regulated by miR-181c in CML cells (Figure 4),
we further investigated whether dysregulation miR-181c
altered the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway. As shown in
Figure 6A, a significant increase in PI3K p110α, phosphoAkt 308, phospho-Akt 473 and NF-κB protein was
observed when miR-181c was inhibited in K562 cells. By
contrast, there was no change in the total amount of Akt
protein, demonstrating a truedecrease in phosphorylation
status. In addition, after overexpression of miR-181c in

K562/ADR cells, we observed a noticeable decrease in
protein expression of PI3K110α, p-Akt 308, p-Akt 473
and NF-κB (Figure 6B). Together, the data confirmed that
augmented PI3K/AKT pathway expression accompanying
miR-181c deficiency was also associated with activation
of PI3K/AKT.
To further support the role of PI3K/AKT signaling
in regulation chemoresistance by miR-181c, Akt shRNA
was utilized in K562 cells. The protein levels of the
main signal molecules of PI3K/AKT pathway were
analyzed by western blotting. Our results indicated
that in K562-antagomiR-181c cells, the protein levels
of PI3K/AKT pathway were decreased in Akt shRNA
treatment group compared to control group (Figure 6C).
In addition, inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway made the
K562-antagomiR-181c cells susceptible to chemotherapy
(Figure 6D). These data indicated the involvement PI3K/
AKT pathway in suppression of drug resistance by
miR-181c.

intratumorally injected with mimic control or miR-181c
mimic three times per week for three weeks,combining
with intraperitoneal injection of adriamycin (7mg/kg)
weekly or PBS. The tumor volumes were decreased in
the miR-181c group,as compared to the mimic control
group (Figure 7A). Significantly, the combined miR-181c
and adriamycin treatment markedly restricted the tumor
growth to low volumes. These results suggested that miR181c decreased adriamycin resistance and tumor growth,
while injection of miR-181c sensitized K562/ADR cells
to adriamycin treatment and inhibited tumor growth.
Meanwhile, tumors injected with miR-181c had decreased
Ki67, ST8SIA4, PI3K p110α, p-Akt 308, p-Akt 473 and
NF-κB expression, analyzed by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 7B and 7C). These results further suggest that
miR-181c and its downstream PI3K/AKT pathway play
important roles in controlling K562/ADR cells adriamycin
sensitivity in vivo.

DISCUSSION

MiR-181c decreases chemoresistance of K562/
ADR cells in vivo

MiRNAs can regulate various biological processes
in tumorigenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance. In the
current study, we reported that specific miRNA expression
signatures characterized and contributed to the MDR
phenotypic of CML cell lines. Among them, we validated
miR-181c, which was downregulated in chemoresistant
CML cell lines and CML/MDR patients. Furthermore,
miR-181c could exert chemoresistant functions and
impede CML drug resistance, partly through targeting

The promotive effect of miR-181c on CML cell
chemoresistance was further examined in vivo. Mice
were inoculated subcutaneously (1 × 107 K562/ADR
cells per mouse) in the right flank. One week later, the
mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6/
group, mimic control group, mimic control+ADR group,
miR-181c group, miR-181c+ADR group). Mice were

ST8SIA4 and its downstream PI3K/AKT pathway both
in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide a insight into the
function of miR-181c in regulating ST8SIA4 and drug
resistance in CML cells.
The miR-181 family contains four miRNAs
(miR-181a/b/c/d). Recent studies showed that
miR-181 also play a vital role in chemotherapeutic
resistance. Restoration of miR-181a expression could
sensitize K562/A02 and HL-60/Ara-C cell lines to
chemotherapeutic agents [21, 22]. MiR-181b enhanced
resistance to the anticancer drug doxorubicin in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [23], and functioned as
a tumor suppressor in AML chemoresistance [24]. In the
present study, we performed miRNA expression profiling
in adriamycin-sensitive cell line K562 and adriamycinresistant cell line K562/ADR. The expression of miR181c was decreased in ADR-resistant cell lines (K562/
ADR, KU812/ADR, KCL22/ADR) as well as in CML/

MDR patients. Moreover, we found that inhibition of
miR-181c may enhance resistance to the anticancer
drugs of K562 cells. Overexpression of miR-181c
sensitized K562/ADR cells to chemotherapy both
in vitro and in vivo. Our findings were supported by
investigations in another study. Contrary to our results,
miR-181c contributed pancreatic cancer cell resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs by inactivating the Hippo
signaling pathway [25]. Down-regulation of miR-181c
was found in imatinib-resistant CML patients, compared
with imatinib-responders patients [26], which was
consistent with our study. These results additionally
demonstrate that miR-181c may be a reasonable approach
to improving or prolonging drug sensitivity in CML.

catalyze oligo- and polysialylation of surface-localized
glycoproteins and glycolipids through transfer of
sialic acids from CMP-sialic acid to the nonreducing
ends of sialic acid acceptors [30]. Our previously
showed that the sialyltransferase ST8SIA4, encoded
N-acetylgalactosaminide a-2, 8-sialyltransferase IV
(ST8SIA4), was critical for CML multidrug resistance
[19, 20]. In addition, miRNAs that target glycosylation
enzymes have been identified. Vaiana et al demonstrated
that MGAT4A, an N-acetylglucosamintltransferase that
installed the β-1, 4 branch of N-glycans, was directly
regulated by miR-424 in multiple mammary epithelial
cell lines [31]. MiR-200a might target ST3GAL3 and
ST3GAL4 sialyltransferases, which potentially involved
in antithrombin sialylation, were 85% lower in neonates
in comparison with adults [32]. MiR-199a targeted
ST6GAL1 and reduced both the sialylation and the protein
level of Necl-2 [33]. Herein we demonstrated that miR181c targets the 3’ UTR of the sialylation related gene
ST8SIA4, suggesting the enzyme may play a role in
cancer chemoresistance. Thus, further exploration of the
interaction between miR-181c and ST8SIA4 in alternate
MDR system of CML was warranted. We showed that
downregulation of miR-181 contributes to high levels of
ST8SIA4. While, forced expression of miR-181c resulted
in a significant decrease of ST8SIA4. We also observed
a significant inverse correlation between miR-181c and
ST8SIA4 levels in CML patients. Furthermore, silencing
of the ST8SIA4 gene reversed antagomiR-181c-mediated

sensitivity of the K562 cells to ADR, VCR and Taxol.
Overexpression of ST8SIA4 in K562/ADR cells increased
chemoresistance after miR-181c introduction. Taken
together, our findings suggest that miR-181c mediates
CML chemoresistance at least in part by functionally
targeting ST8SIA4.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that activation
of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was essential to the
development and progression of most cancer types
and associated with nearly all aspects of the malignant
phenotype of cancer, such as uncontrolled proliferation,
resistance to cell death, invasiveness, angiogenesis and
metastasis [34, 35]. PI3K/AKT inhibition correlated
down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity and inhibition
P-gp function in murine lymphoma cell lines [36].
Inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway was a promising
therapeutic approach in patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia [37]. Recent evidences have indicated that
miRNAs were involved in the regulation of PI3K/AKT
signaling pathways. For example, overexpression of
miR-22 in CLL B cells switched on PI3K/AKT, leading
to downregulation of p27 (-Kip1) and overexpression of
Survivin and Ki-67 proteins [38]. Ectopic expression of
miR-206 mimics inhibited cisplatin resistance, decreased
the migration and invasion in cisplatin-resistant lung
adenocarcinoma cells, partly due to inactivation of MET/
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway [39]. Our recent
study showed that downregulation of ST8SIA4 expression
suppressed the activity of PI3K/AKT pathway. In the

current World Health Organization criteria. The diagnosis
of CML was based on cytomorphology, cytochemistry,
multiparameter flow cytometry, immunology, molecular
genetics and cytogenetics. All the participants were
provided written informed consent and the study were
approved by and the institutional ethics committees.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated
using Ficoll-Hypaque and were further cultured in plastic
dishes to remove adherent cells at 37°C for 24 h. The
PBMC were divided into two groups, CML without MDR
and CML/MDR. The frequency of P-gp positivity was
57.9% (22 of 38) in the CML patients.The clinical data of
enrolled 38 patients was given in Supplementary Table S1.

present study, we found miR-181c-ST8SIA4 axis regualted
PI3K/AKT in CML cell lines. MiR-181c inhibitor
enhanced phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT in K562 cells.
In contrast, miR-181c suppressed the phosphorylation
of PI3K/AKT in K562/ADR cells. Further investigation
detected Akt shRNA inhibited the phosphorylation of
PI3K/AKT in K562-antagomiR-181c cells, subsequently
leading to a decrease in chemoresistance. Other studies
also reported that ectopic expression of miR-181a leads
to AKT phosphorylation, enhancing cell proliferation
and inducing cell resistance to chemotherapy in T-cell
leukemia/lymphoma [40]. These findings may indicate
that miR-181 functions as both an oncomir and tumorsuppressive miRNA, depending on the tumor type and the
subtypes of miR-181. These results provides a possible
mechanism linking miR-181c, PI3K/AKT pathway,
drug resistance, by which altered expression of ST8SIA4
leads to drug resistance in CML cell lines. In addition,
we also assessed the anti-tumor effect of miR-181c in an
adriamycin-resistant in vivo mice model. We found that
overexpression of miR-181c enhanced the K562/ADR
cell sensitivity to adriamycin and inhibited the PI3K/
AKT pathway and ST8SIA4 expression in vivo. Therefore,
these results further demonstrated in vivo that miR181c inhibiting ST8SIA4 and its downstream PI3K/AKT
pathways is one potential mechanism to overcome drug
resistance in CML.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that miR181c was downregulated in adriamycin-resistant chronic
myelocytic leukemia cell lines and CML/MDR patients.
In addition, we showed that miR-181c regulated
chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo by targeting
ST8SIA4 and mediating its downstream PI3K/AKT.
Therefore, activation of miR-181c or inactivation of its
target gene pathway may be a potential strategy to reverse
drug resistance in human CML.

miRNA expression arrays
miRNA arrays were performed for K562 group and
K562/ADR group (n=3/group) by Exiqon (KangChen,
China) using the miRCURY™Hy3™/Hy5™ power
labelling kit and the miRCURY™ LNA Array (v.10.0; 757
human miRs). The expression values are log2 (Hy3/Hy5)
ratios. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of miRNAs
was performed.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Total RNAs for array analysis were extracted using
Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) or
RNA was precipitated with isopropanol and glycogen
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA were synthesised from RNA using a TaqMan
miRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA), and quantified the expression levels
of miR-181c using a miRNA-specific TaqMan MiRNA
Assay Kit (Applied Biosystems). The expression of miRNA
was defined based on the Ct, and relative expression levels
were calculated as 2-[(Ct of miR-181c) − (Ct of U6)] after normalization
with reference to expression of U6 small nuclear RNA.

Cell culture

Western blotting

Human CML in blast crisis cell lines, K562, KCL22,
KU812 were both cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) at 37°C in humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. The resistant cell lines, K562/ADR,
KCL22/ADR, and KU812/ADR were incubated in the
presence of adriamycin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, 1 μg/ml) until
at least 3 days before starting the experiments.

Cells were harvested, lysed and sonicated in RIPA
buffer. A total of 10-50 μg of protein was electrophoresed
in SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
The membranes were then incubated with the following
antibodies: anti-ST8SIA4, anti-PI3K p110α, anti-phosphoAkt 308, anti-phospho-Akt 473, and anti-Akt and anti-NF-κB
antibodies (Abgent, Cambridge, UK). The immunoblots were
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Primary patient samples

The cell viability was monitored using the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies,
60083

Oncotarget

Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, cells (1×104) were plated in 96-well plate
and allowed to grow for 48 h before the addition of CCK8.
The spectrometric absorbance was measured at 490nm by
microplate reader (Model 680; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). All of the experiments were repeated at least three
times.

injected intratumorally with miR-181c mimic or mimic
control three times per week for 3 weeks, combining with
intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (7mg/kg) weekly.
Tumors were examined every 7 days. Tumor volume was
calculated using the equation (length × width2)/2.

Apoptosis assay

At the end of observation animals were sacrificed
and tumors were retrieved for further analysis. Tumors
were immediately immersed in 4% buffered formaldehyde,
washed, dehydrated, and finally embedded in paraffin. Tumor
slices 5 μm thick were deparaffinized. After washing steps,
peroxidase blocking was carried out for 10 min to quench the
endogenous peroxidase. Tumors were again washed and then
incubated with the primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The
secondary streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
antibody staining (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) was
performed at room temperature for 60 min. Subsequently,
slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.

Immunohistochemistry

Cell apoptosis was evaluated using an Annexin-VFITC apoptosis detection kit (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
Briefly, after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (K562/
ADR, ADR/VCR/Taxol 40 μg/ml; K562, ADR/VCR/Taxol
1μg/ml), for 48 h, 2×105 cells were harvested, resuspended
in 100 μl flow cytometry binding buffer, and stained with
5 μl Annexin V/FITC followed by 1 μl PI. Cells were then
incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature, and
400 μl binding buffer was added. The cells were immediately
measured by FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson, CA, USA).

Statistical analysis

Plasmids, oligonucleotides, shRNA and
transfection

The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
software. The data are presented as the mean± SD. Student’s
t-test (two-tailed) was employed to analyze the significance
of differences between two groups of data in all pertinent
experiments. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used to determine whether there are any significant
differences between the means of more than two groups.
The association between miR-181c and ST8SIA4 expression
was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation analysis.
Statistical significance was defined as p< 0.05.

The region of the human ST8SIA4 3′-UTR,
generated by PCR amplification from DNA, was cloned
into vector pmirGLO (Promega). MiR-181c mimic,
antagomiR-181c from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China).
For depletion of ST8SIA4, shRNAs were synthesized
and purified. Overexpressing of ST8SIA4 was generated
by transduction using a pEGFP-N2 vector (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Transfection was performed using the
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s instruction.
