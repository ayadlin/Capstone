ABSTRACT
This study included patients with primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
who underwent resection without neoadjuvant chemotherapy between January
2004 and December 2014. Among the 248 TNBCs studied, programmed cell death
ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression was detected in 103 (41.5%) tumors, and high levels
of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were present in 118 (47.6%) tumors. PDL1 expression correlated with high levels of TILs, but was not a prognostic factor.
Patients with TILs-high tumors had better overall survival than those with TILslow tumors (P = 0.016). There was a strong interaction between PD-L1 expression
and TILs that was associated with both recurrence-free survival (P = 0.0018) and
overall survival (P = 0.015). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis
showed that PD-L1-positive/TILs-low was an independent negative prognostic factor
for both recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Our findings suggest that PDL1-positive/TILs-low tumors are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with
TNBC, and that it is important to focus on the combination of PD-L1 expression on
tumor cells and TILs present in the tumor microenvironment. These biomarkers may
be useful for stratification of TNBCs and for predicting prognosis and developing novel
cancer immunotherapies.

subtypes. In general, TNBC is a high-grade, aggressive
disease with a high rate of distant metastasis, and is
associated with a poorer outcome than other breast
cancer subtypes, despite a good response to standard
chemotherapy regimens [1]. Therefore, further definition
of these subclasses and novel therapeutic strategies are
needed to predict prognosis and choose appropriate
treatments for patients with TNBC.

INTRODUCTION
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is
characterized by a lack of expression of estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and represents up to
20% of all breast cancers. This subtype is a heterogeneous
tumor that encompasses other breast cancer molecular

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been
shown to have prognostic and predictive value in both
adjuvant [2–4] and neoadjuvant settings [5–7] in breast
cancer, especially in TN and HER2 breast cancers. TILs
(both stromal and intratumoral) are associated with high
histologic grade, hormone receptor negativity and high
Ki-67 expression [2], possibly as a result of the load of
somatic mutation. In TNBC in particular, a high number
of stromal TILs is predictive of a more favorable outcome,
and the prognostic value of stromal TILs can be considered
strong evidence. However, according to the International
TILs Working Group, TILs should not yet be used as a
biomarker for withholding chemotherapy [8].
The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1,
also known as CD279) pathway plays a crucial role in
regulating immune responses. Programmed cell death
ligand-1 (PD-L1, ligand for PD-1; also known as B7-H1
or CD274) on tumor cells is upregulated by constitutive
oncogenic signaling (innate resistance) or by inflammatory
signals in the tumor microenvironment (adaptive
resistance), such as interferon-γ (INF-γ) produced by some
activated T cells and natural killer cells [9]. Although
some results remain controversial [10], PD-L1 expression
reportedly correlates with a poor clinical outcome in
several types of malignancy, and may be a predictive
marker of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition [11–13]. In
TNBC, the value of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker
has so far been controversial [14–18] and the underlying
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, further
studies are needed to identify immune biomarkers for the
selection of patients who would most likely benefit from
novel immunotherapies.
In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed
PD-L1 expression and stromal TILs in 248 TNBCs.
We also explored the correlation between immunologic
features on tumors and immune cells and the
clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors, their
response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome.

tumors, and 31 (21.4%) PD-L1-negative tumors (Figure
1). Positive PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated
with high levels of TILs (P < 0.0001, Figure 1). Patients
with PD-L1-positive tumors were younger than those with
PD-L1-negative tumors (P = 0.007). The nuclear grade and
Ki-67 index were higher in PD-L1-positive tumors than
in PD-L1-negative tumors (P = 0.0015 and P < 0.0001,
respectively), although there was no significant difference
between the two groups with respect to tumor size, nodal
status and pathological stage (Table 1). We also evaluated
PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (PDL1IC expression). PD-L1IC-positive tumors were observed
in 129 (52.0%) of the TN tumors (Supplementary Table 1
and Supplementary Figure 3). Positive PD-L1 expression
on tumor cells was significantly correlated with positive
PD-L1IC expression (Table 1).

Patient survival
The median follow-up in this cohort was 68 months
(range 2–150 months). There was no significant difference
in recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival
(OS) between patients with PD-L1-positive tumors and
those with PD-L1-negative tumors (Figure 2A, 2B), and
also there was no difference between patients with PDL1IC-positive tumors and those with PD-L1IC-negative
tumors (Supplementary Figure 4). Although there was no
significant difference in RFS between patients with TILshigh and TILs-low tumors (Figure 2C), patients with TILshigh tumors had significantly better OS than those with
TILs-low tumors (P = 0.016, Figure 2D).
The Cox proportional hazards model showed a
significant interaction between PD-L1 and TILs (P =
0.0018 for RFS; P = 0.015 for OS, Table 2); that is, PDL1 expression and TILs were not independent prognostic
factors. The patients were therefore divided into four
subgroups: PD-L1-positive/TILs-high, PD-L1-positive/
TILs-low, PD-L1-negative/TILs-high and PD-L1-negative/
TILs-low. Kaplan-Meier graphical analysis demonstrated
that both RFS (P = 0.0045, Figure 3A) and OS (P = 0.0036,
Figure 3B) differed significantly among the four subgroups.
The treatment background of these four subgroups did not
significantly differ (Supplementary Table 3).

RESULTS
Clinicopathological features, PD-L1 expression,
and TILs
We evaluated 248 TN tumors with respect to the
clinicopathological data (Table 1), PD-L1 expression on
tumor cells (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary
Figure 1) and stromal TILs (Supplementary Figure 2).
Among the 248 TN tumors, PD-L1 expression was
classified as strong-positive in 38 (15.3%), weakpositive in 65 (26.2%), and negative in 145 (58.5%)
(Supplementary Table 1). Stromal TILs were present at a
high level in 118 (47.6%) of the tumors (Supplementary
Table 2). The breakdown of these results is as follows:
high levels of TILs were present in 35 (92.1%) PD-L1
strong-positive tumors, 52 (80.0%) PD-L1 weak-positive

Univariate and multivariate survival analysis
Univariate analysis of the clinicopathological
characteristics revealed that tumor size (> 2 cm) and
lymph node involvement were significantly related
to poorer RFS and OS, while TILs-high tumors were
significantly related to better OS (Table 3A). In addition,
when we compared the PD-L1-positive/TILs-high
subgroup, which had the longest RFS and OS, with other
three subgroups, the PD-L1-positive/TILs-low subgroup
had significant greater  recurrence and death risks (for

DISCUSSION

inter-observer reproducibility [23, 24]. We evaluated TILs
according to these guidelines, and our data showed that
patients with TILs-high tumors had significantly better
OS than those with TILs-low tumors. This finding was
consistent with the previous results of Pruneri et al. [8],
who showed that each 10% increase in TILs strongly
predicted better survival.
In the present study, PD-L1 expression was
significantly correlated with higher levels of TILs. There
few reports on the relationship between PD-L1 and
TILs, and their results are controversial: higher CD8+
lymphocyte infiltration was related to lower PD-L1
expression in early-stage breast cancer [25], whereas PDL1 expression showed a positive correlation with levels of
infiltrating intratumoral CD8+ and FOXP3+ lymphocytes
in breast cancer [18].
Our univariate analysis showed that PD-L1
expression on tumor cells was not a prognostic factor for
RFS or OS. In combination, however, PD-L1 and TILs
had a pronounced influence on patient prognosis, owing

PD-L1 positivity in TNBC ranged from 19% to
58% in two previous studies [14, 19]. Differences in the
cut-off value and primary antibody are likely reasons for
the discrepancy in the percentages of PD-L1 expression
between the two studies. Although studies have been
conducted to analyze the relationship between PD-L1
and breast cancer, including all subtypes, the prognosis of
patients with PD-L1-positive tumors remains controversial:
PD-L1 was related to a poor prognosis [19–21], whereas
PD-L1 expression was a good prognostic factor for breast
cancer [16, 22], especially for basal-like tumors [17].
These controversial results might reflect the presence of
multiple breast cancer subtypes, biological heterogeneity,
or non-uniform methods for assessing PD-L1 status.
The International TILs Working Group recently
issued recommendations for improving the consistency in
scoring TILs, including detailed guidelines for annotating
the prevalence of lymphocyte infiltration that may improve

to interaction between PD-L1 and TILs. In addition, our
multivariate analysis showed that the PD-L1-positive/
TILs-low subgroup had the poorest prognosis, while
the PD-L1-positive/TILs-high subgroup had the best
prognosis among the four subgroups. Modulation of PDL1 levels occurs via two major pathways, the intracellular
(innate) signaling pathway mediated by PI3K/AKT/
mTOR activation and/or the extracellular induced
(adaptive) pathway mediated by IFNγ production by
TILs and subsequent IFNGRs/JAK/STAT signaling in
tumor cells [26]. When TILs levels are decreased in PDL1-positive tumors, there may be aberrant activation of
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Conversely, when levels of
TILs are increased in PD-L1-positive tumors, there may
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be activation of IFNGRs/JAK/STAT signaling mediated
by IFNγ production by TILs. Webb et al. showed that
the PD-L1-positive/CD8+ tumors are associated with
a better prognosis than PD-L1-negative/CD8+ or PDL1-negative/CD8– tumors in high-grade serous ovarian
cancer [27]. Teng et al. reported that four types of tumor
microenvironment exist on the basis of their PD-L1 status
and presence or absence of TILs [28]. Microenvirionments
that are PD-L1-positive with TILs driving adaptive
immune resistance are associated with the best prognosis.
This is the first report of an interaction between
PD-L1 and TILs in breast cancer. The combination of
PD-L1 and TILs may be the most robust factor predictive
of prognosis in TNBC. Although PD-L1 expression is
15589

generally considered to indicate a poor prognosis [11–13],
the prognosis of patients with PD-L1-positive/TILs-high
tumors was improved. We therefore expect a positive effect
of novel anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapies in
patients with PD-L1-positive/TILs-low tumors, for whom
prognosis is currently poor. In fact, in a phase Ib trial for
PD-L1-positive TNBCs (KEYNOTE-012), it was unclear
whether PD-L1 expression was predictive of a clinical
benefit with the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab [29].
This study had several limitations. First, it included
only retrospectively collected cases. Second, although
we assessed the interactive effect PD-L1 and TILs, the
causal relationship is not clear. Finally, these factors were
not predictive of the response to treatments, including
anthracycline- or taxane-based regimens (data not shown).
In conclusion, we report that PD-L1 expression
on tumor cells is related to high TILs levels, and the
combination of PD-L1-positive and TILs-low is associated
with a poor prognosis in TNBC. Although additional
research into the underlying mechanisms is necessary,
these biomarkers may be useful for stratification for TNBC
patients and for predicting their prognosis. Our findings
support a rationale for the development of novel immunetargeted therapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, for
patients with TNBC.

neutral buffered formalin for 6 to 72 h. ER-positive or
PR-positive tissues were defined as ≥ 1% of tumor cells
staining positive for ER or PR. Cancer specimens were
defined as HER2-positive when HER2 IHC staining was
scored as 3+ according to the standard criteria [34, 35],
or when HER2 gene amplification was detected using
fluorescence spectroscopy with in situ hybridization.
The primary anti-PD-L1 antibody (monoclonal rabbit,
E1L3N; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) was
used with a Ventana Discovery XT automated stainer
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and using proprietary reagents.
Briefly, slides were deparaffinized on the automated
system with EZ Prep solution. A heat-induced antigen
retrieval method was used in standard Cell Conditioning
1 with an incubation temperature of 95°C. The primary
antibody was used at a 1:200 dilution and was incubated
for 32 min. The secondary antibody was SignalStain Boost
IHC Detection Reagent (Cell Signaling Technology).
Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, and a
bluing reagent was used for counterstaining. Using the
clinical trial assay to identify levels of PD-L1 expression
on tumor cells that maximally predict clinical response to
pembrolizumab [29], PD-L1 weak-positive was defined as
membranous PD-L1 expression in 1–49% of tumor cells,
and PD-L1 strong-positive was defined as expression
in ≥ 50% of tumor cell (Supplementary Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, PD-L1IC-positive
was defined as expression in ≥ 5% of tumor-infiltrating
immune cells [12] (Supplementary Figure 3).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study included 248 patients with primary TNBC
who underwent resection without neoadjuvant chemotherapy
at Kyushu University Hospital (Fukuoka, Japan),
Hamanomachi Hospital (Fukuoka, Japan) or Kumamoto
City Hospital (Kumamoto, Japan) between January 2004
and December 2014. About 20% of patients diagnosed
with TNBC received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our
institutions and were excluded from this study. The patients
received adjuvant treatment according to the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines for treatment
of breast cancer (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/
physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#breast), the Clinical Practice
Guideline of Breast Cancer by the Japanese Breast Cancer
Society (http://jbcs.xsrv.jp/guidline/, in Japanese), and the
recommendations of the St. Gallen International Breast
Cancer Conference [30–33]. The treatment characteristics
for the patients are shown in Supplementary Table 3. The
study conformed to the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Kyushu University Hospital (No. 27-102).

Evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
TILs were assessed in hematoxylin and eosinstained sections, carefully following the guidelines
published by the International TILs Working Group to
standardize TILs evaluation [23, 24] while blinded to
the clinical information. These recommendations mainly
propose a focus on stromal TILs. Cases were defined as
TILs-high for ≥ 50% stromal TILs, which is also known as
lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer, and as TILs-low
for < 50% stromal TILs (Supplementary Figure 2).

Statistics
Logistic regression was used to compare continuous
variables and χ2 tests were used to compare categorical
variables between the PD-L1-positive and PD-L1negative groups. The survival endpoints evaluated were
RFS and OS. RFS was defined as the time from surgery
to recurrence, including both local relapse and metastatic
disease. OS was defined as the time from surgery until
the date of death from any cause. Survival curves were
generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared
with the log-rank test. Hazard ratios were calculated using
Cox proportional hazards regression. Values of P < 0.05

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
