Abstract
Recent clinical trials raised concerns regarding the cardiovascular toxicity of selective cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) inhibitors and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is now being reconsidered as a target for chemoprevention.
Our aims were to determine whether selective COX-1 inhibition could delay or prevent cancer development and
also clarify the underlying mechanisms. Data clearly showed that COX-1 was required for maintenance of
malignant characteristics of colon cancer cells or tumor promoter-induced transformation of preneoplastic cells.
We also successfully applied a ligand-docking computational method to identify a novel selective COX-1 inhibitor,
6-C-(E-phenylethenyl)-naringenin (designated herein as 6CEPN). 6CEPN could bind to COX-1 and speciﬁcally
inhibited its activity both in vitro and ex vivo. In colorectal cancer cells, it potently suppressed anchorageindependent growth by inhibiting COX-1 activity. 6CEPN also effectively suppressed tumor growth in a 28-day
colon cancer xenograft model without any obvious systemic toxicity. Taken together, COX-1 plays a critical role in
human colorectal carcinogenesis, and this speciﬁc COX-1 inhibitor merits further investigation as a potential
preventive agent against colorectal cancer. Cancer Res; 74(1); 243–52. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third most common noncutaneous
malignancy and also the third leading cause of cancer-related
death in the United States (1). Fortunately, during colorectal
carcinogenesis, the transition from normal mucosa to adenoma and ﬁnal carcinoma is a protracted event that offers
opportunities for preventive interventions. Chemoprevention
by targeting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been used successfully and seems to be a promising strategy for prevention of
colorectal cancer (2–4). However, recent clinical trial studies
raised concerns regarding the cardiovascular toxicity of selective COX-2 inhibitors (5, 6). Animal model studies further
revealed that COX-2 plays a crucial role in cardioprotection
(7–10), and thus persistent COX-2 inhibition might not be an
ideal chemopreventive strategy.
Although evidence implicates a crucial role of COX-2 in
colorectal cancer development, the idea that COX-2 is the only
COX isoform involved in carcinogenesis has been challenged.
For example, aspirin at low doses (81 mg per day) is widely
accepted to be able to provide both cardioprotective and colon
cancer chemopreventive effects (11–13). However, pharmacoAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota,

kinetic data analysis revealed that low doses of aspirin mainly
target COX-1 rather than COX-2 (14, 15). Genetic disruption of
ptgs-1 [gene encoding for cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)] or ptgs-2
(gene encoding for COX-2) reduces intestinal polyposis to a
similar extent (16, 17). Importantly, targeting COX-1 was effective in preventing not only colon cancer but also other tumor
types such as skin cancer and ovarian cancer (17, 18). Deﬁciency
of COX-1 reduced mouse skin tumorigenesis by 75%, whereas a
COX-1 inhibitor (SC560) effectively attenuated epithelial ovarian
tumor growth in multiple genetically engineered mouse models.
Thus, COX-1 is now being reconsidered as a target for
chemoprevention (19, 20). To gain a deeper insight into the
role of COX-1 in human cancer development, we used a liganddocking computational method to identify a novel selective
COX-1 inhibitor, 6-C-(E-phenylethenyl)- naringenin (i.e.,
6CEPN). We then evaluated its chemopreventive activity
against colon cancer both in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and chemicals
6CEPN was chemically synthesized as described previously
(21). CNBr-Sepharose 4B beads were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. All other chemicals
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Cell culture
All cell lines used in this study were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained
following ATCC instructions. Cells were cytogenetically tested
and authenticated before being frozen. Each vial of frozen cells
was thawed and maintained for a maximum of 20 passages.

Cell transfection
For either transient or lentiviral transfection in adherent
cells, the jetPEI reagent (Qbiogen, Inc.) was used following
the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length cDNAs for COX-1
and COX-2 (pCMV-SPORT6-COX-1 and pCMV-SPORT6-COX-2)
and the 29-mer small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs against
COX-1 and COX-2 were from Open Biosystems, Inc.
Cell growth assay
Cells were seeded (1  103 cells per well) in 96-well plates.
After incubation for various times, 20 mL of CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution (Invitrogen) were added. Cells were further
incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Finally, the optical density was
determined at 492 nm.
Anchorage-independent cell growth
In each well of a 6-well plate, cells (8 103) were suspended
in Basal Medium Eagle (BME) medium (1 mL, with 10% FBS
and 0.33% agar) and plated over a layer of solidiﬁed BME (3 mL,
with 10% FBS and 0.5% agar). The cultures were incubated in a
37 C, 5% CO2 incubator for 7 days and colonies in soft agar
were counted under a microscope equipped with the ImagePro Plus software program (vs. 6; Media Cybernetics).
In vitro pull-down assay
Recombinant COX-1 and COX-2 (0.5 mg) or endogenous cell
lysates (500 mg) were incubated with 6CEPN-Sepharose 4B
beads (100 mL, 50% slurry) in reaction buffer (50 mmol/L Tris
pH 7.5, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L DTT,
0.01% NP40, 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.02 mmol/L
phenylmethysulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF), 1 protease inhibitor
mixture). Incubation with gentle rocking was performed overnight at 4 C. The beads were then washed a total of 5 times with
washing buffer and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed
by Western blotting.
In vitro COX enzyme assay
The effect of 6CEPN on COX activity was evaluated using a
COX Inhibitor Screening Kit (Cayman Chemical Company)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and
6-keto prostaglandin F1a (6-keto PGF1a) determination
The measurement of prostaglandins in the cell-culture
medium or mouse serum was performed using Enzyme Immunoassay Kits from Cayman Chemical Company. In brief, cells
(6  105) were plated in a 6-well plate with 10% serum. When
cells reached 80% conﬂuency, 1 mL fresh medium with 6CEPN
or vehicle was added and cells were further incubated for 24
hours. Supernatant fractions were collected for prostaglandin
measurement according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blot analysis
Protein samples (20 mg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Corporation). After blocking, the membranes were
probed with primary antibodies (1:1,000) overnight at 4 C.
The targeted protein bands were visualized using an enhanced

244

chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Corporation) after
hybridization with a secondary antibody conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase.
Xenograft mouse model
Athymic mice [Cr: NIH(S), NIH Swiss nude, 6- to 9-week old]
were obtained from Charles River and maintained under
"speciﬁc pathogen-free" conditions based on the guidelines
established by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Austin, MN). Mice were divided
into 4 groups (n ¼ 6 in each group). HT29 colon cancer cells
(2  106 cells/100 mL) were suspended in serum-free McCoy's
5A medium and injected subcutaneously into the right ﬂank
of each mouse. 6CEPN dissolved in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/PEG400 was given to the mice by gavage every
other day for total of 6 weeks. Tumor volume and body weight
were measured every other day. Venous blood was collected
from mice postmortem by suctioning from the right ventricle
using a syringe containing sodium citrate. Blood samples were
then centrifuged at 2,000  g for 15 minutes, and the resulting
supernatant fraction was designated as serum.
Molecular modeling
The three-dimensional structures of COX-1 and COX-2
were directly downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
for docking studies. COX-1 (PDB code 3KK6) is an X-ray
diffraction structure with a resolution of 2.75 Å and COX-2
(PDB code 1PXX) is an X-ray diffraction structure with a
resolution of 2.9 Å. The proteins were prepared for docking
following the standard procedure outlined with the Protein
Preparation Wizard in Schr€
odinger Suite 2012. All crystallographic waters were deleted and a 30-Å grid was generated
on both COX-1 and COX-2 active sites to deﬁne the protein
receptor for docking following the standard procedure outlined in Schr€
odinger's GLIDE docking package. The Zinc
natural database, FDA-approved drug database, Traditional
Chinese Medicine, a ﬂavonoid compound database, and our
in-house library of compounds were each used in the virtual
screening.
Statistical analysis
All cell line experiments were performed independently at
least 3 times. Statistical analysis was performed using the
Prism statistical package. Turkey t test was used to compare
data between 2 groups. One-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni
correction were used to compare data between 3 or more
groups. Values are expressed as means  SEM unless otherwise
indicated. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
COX-1 is required for maintaining colorectal cancer cell
malignant characteristics
To determine whether COX-1 is directly associated with the
tumorigenic properties of colon cancer cells, we ﬁrst examined
COX expression in normal and colon cancer cells (Fig. 1A).
Consistent with previous reports (22, 23), COX-1 is present
both in normal and malignant colon cancer cells, whereas

6CEPN Suppresses Colon Cancer by Inhibiting COX-1

Figure 1. COX-1 is required for maintenance of malignant characteristics of colorectal cancer cells. A, Western blot analysis of COX-1 and COX-2
expression in human colorectal cancer and normal colon epithelial cells (HCEC). B, COX-1 is required for anchorage-independent growth of colorectal
cancer cells. C, COX-1 and COX-2 are equally important for tumorigenic properties in human colorectal cancer cells. Knockdown of COX-1 or
COX-2 in colon cancer cells was analyzed by Western blot. Mock and knockdown cells were then subjected to anchorage-dependent growth,
anchorage-independent growth, and PGE2 production assays as described in Materials and Methods. Cell growth was evaluated by MTS assay. Data
are presented as means  SEM (n ¼ 4). Anchorage-independent cell growth was evaluated by colony formation in soft agar. Data are presented
as means  SEM from 3 independent experiments. Production of PGE2 in supernatant fractions was measured by ELISA. Data are presented as

COX-2 is overexpressed only in colorectal cancer cells. Among
the cell lines tested, HT29, HCT115, and DLD1 cells expressed
relatively higher COX-1 levels, and were therefore chosen for
subsequent studies.
Anchorage-independent growth ability is an ex vivo indicator and a key characteristic of the transformed cell phenotype
(24). We thus questioned whether COX-1 inhibition would
affect colon cancer cell growth under anchorage-independent
conditions. Our results revealed that knocking down COX-1
expression in HT29 and HCT115 cells signiﬁcantly decreased

the number of colonies formed in soft agar compared with
Mock-control cells (Fig. 1B).
We also compared the function of COX-1 with COX-2 in
human colon cancer cells. Our results revealed that knocking
down the expression of either COX-1 or COX-2 delayed cell
growth, reduced the number of colonies formed in soft agar,
and decreased PGE2 production in HT29 cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with our ﬁndings, a previous animal study also indicated that both COX-1 and COX-2 contribute to PGE2 production in polyp formation (16).

Involvement of COX-1 in neoplastic transformation
Based on the ﬁnding showing that knockdown of COX-1
greatly abrogated anchorage-independent cell growth, we
hypothesized that COX-1 might also be involved in neoplastic
transformation. The JB6 CI41 cell model is a promotion
sensitive (Pþ) mouse epidermal skin cell line that provides
a unique cell model to characterize the role of COX-1 in
preneoplastic cells (25, 26). We established 2 stable JB6 CI41
clones that express an shRNA-targeting mouse COX-1 (Fig. 2A),
and then tested the effects of COX-1 inhibition on tumor
promoter (TPA or EGF)–induced cell transformation. Results
indicated that either EGF- or TPA-induced cell transformation
was markedly attenuated by knockdown of COX-1 (Fig. 2B).
Additional results indicated that with EGF stimulation, the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) downstream signaling cascades were substantially suppressed in the absence of
COX-1 (Fig. 2C).
Taken together, these ﬁndings indicated that COX-1 is
required for both the maintenance of cancer cell malignant
characteristics and neoplastic transformation.

computational modeling data clearly showed that 6CEPN
could only bind to the COX-1 active site by forming 3
hydrogen bonds with Tyr355, Phe518, and Ser530 (Fig. 3B).
This compound failed to bind to the COX-2 catalytic pocket
because of a potential steric-hindrance effect—a phenomenon in which the enzyme is inaccessible to substrates with an
improper molecular size as well as shape (Fig. 3C, left).
However, even though 6CEPN failed to occupy the active
pocket of COX-2, it still might bind to COX-2 in another region
(i.e., His 207 and His388; Fig. 3C, right).
To validate the computational prediction, we performed an
in vitro pull-down assay using 6CEPN-conjugated Sepharose
4B beads (Fig. 3D). Results revealed that both recombinant
COX-1 and COX-2 bind with 6CEPN-Sepharose 4B beads, but
not with Sepharose 4B beads alone in vitro. We then examined
the potential inhibitory effect of 6CEPN against COX-1 and
COX-2 enzyme activity using a COX Inhibitor Screening Assay
Kit. Our data conﬁrmed that 6CEPN selectively inhibited COX-1,
but not COX-2, activity in vitro (Fig. 3E). These results clearly
support our hypothesis that 6CEPN is a selective COX-1 inhibitor.

The predicted binding mode of 6CEPN with COX-1
Although COX-1 is now being reconsidered as a target for
colorectal cancer chemoprevention, only a few selective COX1 inhibitors have been found (19). To identify a novel potent
selective COX-1 inhibitor, we conducted an intensive molecular-docking analysis using Glide v5.7 (16). We screened
several libraries of compounds and 6CEPN (Fig. 3A) was
identiﬁed as a potential selective COX-1 inhibitor based on
its docking scores against COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. Our

6CEPN suppresses human colorectal cancer cell growth
Next, we determined whether 6CEPN could selectively
inhibit COX-1 activity in cells. Human embryonic kidney
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with a COX-1 or
COX-2 plasmid (Fig. 4A, left) and then treated with 6CEPN.
Data regarding PGE2 release in supernatant fractions clearly
indicated that 6CEPN selectively inhibited COX-1 activity
rather than COX-2, especially at low doses (Fig. 4A, right). We
also conﬁrmed that 6CEPN binds to endogenous COX-1 (Fig.

4B, right). Moreover, 6CEPN potently inhibited anchorageindependent growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C) in
3 colon cancer cell lines. 6CEPN at 2.5 or 5 mmol/L caused a
decrease of more than 70% to 90% compared with untreated
control HT29 cells, which highly express COX-1.
Evaluation of cardiovascular toxicity of 6CEPN
Next, we evaluated the potential cardiovascular toxicity of
6CEPN in an in vitro model using human umbilical vein

endothelial cells (HUVEC). Although undetectable under normal physiological conditions, COX-2 is markedly induced and
exerts a cardiac protective role under pathophysiological
conditions such as during cardiac ischemia or reperfusion
injury. The imbalance between COX-1–derived prothrombotic
thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and COX-2–related antithrombotic
prostacyclin (PGI2) production is suspected to contribute to
the cardiovascular side effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors. In
addition, the ratio of TXB2 (i.e., the stable breakdown product
of TXA2) to 6-keto-PGF1a (i.e., the hydrolysis product of PGI2)

has been used as one of the biomarkers for COX-2 inhibitionrelated cardiovascular toxicity (7, 9, 10, 19, 20, 27, 28). To mimic
proinﬂammatory conditions, HUVECs were treated with IL-1b,
an inﬂammatory cytokine implicated in vascular diseases. IL1b stimulation resulted in a remarkable increase in COX-2
expression as well as 6-keto-PGF1a synthesis (Fig. 5A). 6CPEN,
but not celecoxib, had a modest but signiﬁcant inhibitory effect
on TXB2 synthesis (Fig. 5B, middle). In contrast, celecoxib, but
not 6CPEN, could potently suppress 6-keto-PGF1a synthesis
(Fig. 5B, lower). More importantly, the ratio of TXB2/6-ketoPGF1a was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.001) increased by the selective
COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib even at very low doses (e.g., 0.1
mmol/L), but only weakly disturbed by 6CEPN (Fig. 5B, upper),

suggesting that cardiovascular toxicity is caused by celecoxib
but not by 6CEPN.

Based on both in vitro and ex vivo data, we determined

TXA2, but not PGI2 (13, 19, 27, 28). Similar results were obtained
with 6CEPN treatment in this study (Fig. 6C). Importantly, the
ratio of TXB2 to 6-keto-PGF1a was greatly attenuated by
continuous 6CEPN treatment, suggesting that 6CEPN might
provide cardioprotective effects. Moreover, based on body
weight data (Fig. 6D), general appearance, and organ histology,
6CEPN was well tolerated in mice and no obvious systemic
toxicity (e.g., diarrhea or bleeding in the digestive tract) was
observed during the entire period of drug treatment.

Discussion
In this study, we conﬁrmed a critical role for COX-1 in
colorectal cancer. Phenotypically, COX-1 knockdown or cata-

www.aacrjournals.org

lytic inactivation in colon cancer cells resulted in an obvious
reduction of malignant characteristics, including anchoragedependent and -independent cell growth as well as in the
production of endogenous PGE2. Importantly, COX-1 was also
required for genotoxic carcinogen-induced malignant transformation in preneoplastic cells. All of these ﬁndings provided
an explanation as to why genetic disruption of ptgs-1 reduces
cancer incidence both in skin and colon.
Although more attention has been given to COX-2 as a key
player in the development of various cancers, accumulating
evidence indicates that COX-1 is equally as important as COX-2
for carcinogenesis, especially in skin and colon (16, 17). The
immediate-early phase of prostaglandin production is reportedly mediated by constitutive expression of COX-1, whereas

the later phase of prostaglandin production is dependent
on the induction of COX-2 (29). However, PGE2 can transactivate the EGFR kinase cascade in colon cancer cells, which is
dependent on the extracellular release of an EGF-like ligand
(30), whereas activation of EGFR might conversely stimulate
COX-2 biosynthesis (31). Overall, our data suggest the possibility that both COX-1 and COX-2 contribute to colon cancer
development by cooperating with the EGFR signaling pathway,
which modulates tumorigenesis through multiple biological
effects including anchorage-independent cell growth (32).
Therefore, although COX-1 is generally described as constitutively expressed both in malignant and normal colon tissues,
this might be an oversimpliﬁcation because the COX enzymes
are known to function in the production of prostaglandins,
which is either because of increased protein expression, catalytic activity, or both (27).
In this study, we successfully applied a ligand-docking
computational method and discovered a novel selective
COX-1 inhibitor (6CEPN). Notably, 6CEPN, chemically seems
to be a natural product-based compound, a hybrid molecule of
stilbene with a ﬂavonoid structure. Compared with other
known COX-1 inhibitors, it has a unique carbon skeleton that
might present a new leading COX-1 inhibitor (19, 27, 33). To
identify compounds that show higher selective COX-1 inhibition, more structure-activity studies are needed.
Another question to be addressed is whether selective COX1 inhibition causes gastrointestinal toxicity. Conventional
NSAIDs are known to normally produce much stronger gastrointestinal toxicity than selective COX-2 inhibitors. Considering its high expression in the gastrointestinal tract, COX-1 is
commonly believed to protect the gastrointestinal tract, and
thus selective COX-1 inhibition is still a controversial issue (19,
20, 27). However, no direct evidence exists to support selective
inhibition of COX-1 as the cause of gastrointestinal side effects.
Notably, homozygous ptgs-1 (genes coding for COX-1) mutant
mice do not exhibit gastric lesions even though their PGE2
production in the gastrointestinal tract is just 1% that of wildtype mice (16). Pharmacological inhibition of COX further
suggested that inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 was
required for NSAIDs-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. In the
Wistar rat, neither a selective COX-1 inhibitor (SC560) nor a
COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) could cause obvious gastric damage. However, their combination results in severe gastrointestinal side effects (34). In this study, our COX-1 inhibitor, 6CEPN,
was also well tolerated in mice, and no obvious gastrointestinal
toxicity (e.g., diarrhea and bleeding in digestive tract) was
observed during the entire period of drug treatment.

Although our ﬁndings in this study are promising, several
signiﬁcant questions remain unanswered. For example, whether the inhibitory potential of 6CEPN in vivo was because of a
direct suppression of COX-1 activity (not COX-2) is still
unclear. Addressing this question is challenging with current
technologies because COX-1 and COX-2 normally share the
same substrate (arachidonic acid) and yield the same product
(PGH2) in vivo. Thus, differentiating between their respective
activities is not possible at this time. Another issue is the
relevance of the JB6 cell model to colon carcinogenesis. JB6
Cl41 cells are a promotion sensitive (Pþ) mouse epidermal cell
line. This cell line enables the study of genetic susceptibility to
promotion of transformation, and thus might provide a unique
cell model to characterize activated COX-1 in preneoplastic
cells. TXA2 production in vivo is known to be associated with
COX-1. 6CEPN could markedly lower the serum levels of TXA2
in mice. However, we did not collect pharmacokinetic data in
this study, and therefore whether 6CEPN reached tumors
directly or only inhibited COX-1 activity pharmacologically is
still unknown.
In summary, this study was conducted to characterize the
role of COX-1 in colorectal cancer and evaluate the clinical
potential of a selective COX-1 inhibitor in chemoprevention.
This work together with previous studies by others should
provide insight into the potential application of selective
COX-1 inhibitors in colorectal cancer chemoprevention
(16, 17, 19, 34, 35).
