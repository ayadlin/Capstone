Direct Therapeutic Applications of Calcium Electroporation
to Effectively Induce Tumor Necrosis
Stine Krog Frandsen1, Hanne Gissel2, Pernille Hojman3, Trine Tramm4, Jens Eriksen1,5, and Julie Gehl1

Abstract
Electroporation of cells with short, high-voltage pulses causes a transient permeabilization of cell membranes
that permits passage of otherwise nonpermeating ions and molecules. In this study, we illustrate how electroporation with isotonic calcium can achieve highly effective cancer cell kill in vivo. Calcium electroporation elicited
dramatic antitumor responses in which 89% of treated tumors were eliminated. Histologic analyses indicated
complete tumor necrosis. Mechanistically, calcium electroporation caused acute ATP depletion likely due to a
combination of increased cellular use of ATP, decreased production of ATP due to effects on the mitochondria,
as well as loss of ATP through the permeabilized cell membrane. Taken together, our ﬁndings offer a preclinical
proof of concept for the use of electroporation to load cancer cells with calcium as an efﬁcient anticancer treatment. Electroporation equipment is already used clinically to enhance the delivery of chemotherapy to superﬁcial
tumors, with trials on internal tumors in progress, enabling the introduction of calcium electroporation to clinical use. Moreover, the safety proﬁle, availability, and low cost of calcium facilitate access to this technology for
many cancer patients in developed and developing countries. Cancer Res; 72(6); 1336–41. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Calcium is a ubiquitous second messenger involved in many
cellular processes, including regulation of transcription, metabolism, proliferation, muscle contraction, and cell death (apoptosis and necrosis; refs. 1–3). Due to the many effects of
calcium, the intracellular calcium concentration is tightly regulated, and the effects of calcium are dependent on time, place,
amplitude, frequency, and duration of the calcium signal (1, 2, 4–
6). Cellular uptake of calcium can be facilitated by electroporation in which cells are exposed to an electric ﬁeld exceeding
the dielectric strength of the cell membrane, resulting in generation of reversible permeabilization structures in the membrane (7). In eukaryotic cells, the concentration of free intracellular calcium is very low (107 mol/L), in striking contrast to
the concentration of free calcium in plasma (103 mol/L; ref. 5).
Thus, even a small increase in the permeability of the membrane
may increase the concentration of free intracellular calcium
drastically. Increase in intracellular calcium concentration due
to electroporation has previously been shown (8, 9), but its use in
cancer treatment was not investigated.
Here, we document that calcium electroporation can be
highly efﬁcient in eradicating tumors in vivo, and we

depletion.

Materials and Methods
In vitro electroporation
Three cell lines were used for in vitro experiments, DC-3F, a
transformed Chinese hamster lung ﬁbroblast cell line; K-562, a
human leukemia cell line; and Lewis Lung Carcinoma, a
murine lung carcinoma cell line (all tested negative for mycoplasma). Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 culture medium
(Gibco, Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, Invitrogen),
penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 C and 5% CO2. After harvesting, cells were washed and diluted in HEPES buffer [10 mmol/L
HEPES (Lonza), 250 mmol/L sucrose, and 1 mmol/L MgCl2 in
sterile water]. Cell suspension (270 mL; 6.1  106 cells/mL) with
30 mL CaCl2 or HEPES buffer (controls) were electroporated in
4 mm cuvettes with aluminium electrodes (Molecular BioProducts, Inc.). Cooled cells (8 C) were exposed to 8 pulses of 99 ms
with respectively 1.2 kV/cm (DC-3F and K-562) and 1.4 kV/cm
(Lewis Lung Carcinoma) using a BTX T820 square wave
electroporator. Electroporation parameters were optimized
for high permabilization and cell survival. After 20 minutes
at 37 C and 5% CO2, cells were diluted in culture medium (as
above) and seeded in 96-well plates (3.1  104 cells per 100 mL).
After 1 and 2 days, respectively, MTT assay was conducted with
Multiskan-Ascent ELISA reader (Thermo Labsystems).
Difference between electroporated and nonelectroporated
cells in identical buffer was assessed using 2-way ANOVA with
post least-squares-means test with Bonferroni correction.

Calcium Loading by Electroporation Causes Tumor Necrosis

nonelectroporated cells with 1 mmol/L calcium, and untreated
cells were used as controls. Cell death induced by irreversible
electroporation (8 pulses of 99 ms and 6.6 kV/cm) was used as
negative control. Cells seeded in 96-well plates as above were
lysed with Cell-Based Assay Lysis Buffer (Cayman Chemical),
and ATP content was determined after 1, 4, and 8 hours
incubation by adding 100 mL rL/L Reagent (ENLITEN ATP
Assay; Promega) and measuring light emission using a luminometer (LUMIstar; Ramcon).
Difference in ATP level after different treatments was
assessed by 2-way ANOVA with post least-squares-means test
with Bonferroni correction.
Tumor volume and tumor ﬂuorescence intensity
In vivo experiments were conducted in accordance with
European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals
used for Experimentation and with approval from the Danish
Animal Experiments Inspectorate.
For in vivo experiments, the H69 human small cell lung
cancer cell line stably transfected with enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP) regulated by the cytomegalovirus
promoter (10) was kindly provided by the Department of
Radiation Biology, Copenhagen University Hospital. Cells were
tested by rapid MAP27 panel (Taconic) without signs of
infection. Cells were grown in vitro as described above. A total
of 1.5  106 cells per 100 mL PBS were injected s.c. in both ﬂanks
of 9- to 11-week-old NMRI-Foxn1nu mice (Harlan). Tumor
pieces were transplanted to the right ﬂank of recipient mice.
Hypnorm-dormicum (VetaPharma and Roche) was used for
anesthesia complemented with rimadyl (Pﬁzer Aps) and lidocaine in the incision. Mice were randomized at an average
tumor diameter of 6.2 mm (range, 5.5–6.9 mm) and treated with
(i) injection of isotonic calcium chloride solution (168 mmol/L
CaCl2) and electroporation (8 pulses of 100 ms at 1.0 kV/cm and
1 Hz; refs. 7, 11) using a 6-mm plate electrode and a square wave
electroporator, from Cliniporator, IGEA; (ii) calcium-free physiologic saline injection and electroporation with the same
parameters as above; (iii) isotonic calcium chloride injection;
or (iv) calcium-free physiologic saline injection. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Solaar AAS; Thermo) conﬁrmed
absence of calcium in physiologic saline. Tumor volume was
calculated as ab2p/6 (a, largest diameter; b, largest diameter
perpendicular to a). Initially, tumors were injected with a
volume equivalent to the tumor volume but as the Ca2þ-EP
group showed skin necrosis, the injected volume was changed
to half the tumor volume for all groups. Solutions were injected
through the side of the ﬁrm tumor, and the needle was moved
around inside the tumor to secure injection all over the tumor.
Tumor size measurements (Vernier calliper) and bioimaging
using the Optix MX-2 optical molecular image system (ART)
with a scan resolution of 1.5 mm were carried out before treatment and 3 times a week after treatment. Background ﬂuorescence (opposite ﬂank) was subtracted from ﬂuorescence
intensity of tumors, and ﬂuorescence intensity below 100
normalized counts (NC) was ﬁltered away with Optiview version 2.02 (ART).
Differences in tumor volume and ﬂuorescence intensity in
the 4 treatment groups were evaluated as repeated measure-

ments, validated, and analyzed with an exponential decrease
model with Bonferroni correction using SAS software (version
9.1). "Group," "days," and "mouse" were considered factors, and
baseline levels of tumor volume or ﬂuorescence intensity were
used as covariant. Fluorescence intensity values were log
transformed before analysis.
Histology
At an average diameter of 6.1 mm (range, 5.8–6.6 mm)
tumors were treated with CaCl2 injection and electroporation
as described above. Tumors were removed 2 hours, at days 1, 2,
and 6, respectively, after treatment, ﬁxated in formalin (10%
neutrally buffered), and parafﬁn embedded. Tissue sections
(3 mm) were hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained, and a
fraction of necrosis was estimated by stereologic point counting using a light microscope, and evaluated by a pathologist
who was blinded with respect to treatment status.
Difference in fraction of necrosis was assessed by 1-way
ANOVA with post least-squares-means test with Bonferroni
correction.

Results and Discussion
To test the effect of calcium overloading in vitro, we
electroporated 3 cell lines from different species and of
different tissue origin in buffers with increasing calcium
concentrations (Fig. 1). There was a dose-dependent, dramatic decrease in viability for all electroporated cell lines
with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) whereas
EC50 being 0.57 mmol/L Ca2þ (range, 0.35–0.79 mmol/L) was
not reached without electroporation. As expected, due to
differences in, for example, cell size and homogeneity,
there was a differential effect of the electroporation procedure alone on the different cell lines (12), as electroporation alone reduced viability by 0% (DC-3F), 6% (Lewis Lung
Carcinoma), and 23% (K-562), respectively. Consequently,
values are listed as a percentage of electroporated versus
nonelectroporated controls, respectively. The decrease in
viability after calcium electroporation was similar to the
effect induced by electroporation with the chemotherapeutic
agent bleomycin in concentrations from 0.1 mmol/L (data not
shown).
After having shown a robust anticancer effect in vitro, the
effect of calcium electroporation in vivo was tested. Fluorescent tumors (10) were treated with isotonic calcium chloride
injection and electroporated (Ca2þ-EP, or in the case of controls, injected with calcium-free physiologic saline and electroporated (NaCl-EP), only injected with isotonic calcium
chloride (Ca2þ) or calcium-free physiologic saline (NaCl;
Fig. 2A). Strikingly, Ca2þ-EP treatment eliminated 89% (8 of
9) of the treated tumors. Ulceration occurred in all Ca2þ-EP–
treated tumors, with healing at an average of 18 days (range,
9–24 days). Tumor volume was measured including the
ulceration, giving the impression that tumor volume was
increasing just after treatment; however, ﬂuorescence intensity
showed acute decrease. The volume of tumors treated with
Ca2þ-EP was signiﬁcantly different from controls treated
with Ca2þ (P < 0.0001) and NaCl-EP (P < 0.01). Tumor volume
of all nonelectroporated tumors increased with a doubling

Control

Optical bioimaging was used in vivo to consecutively track
the amount of tumor tissue expressing EGFP (10). Fluorescence intensity of Ca2þ-EP–treated tumors decreased drastically after treatment and stayed at background levels for the
remainder of the experiment, being signiﬁcantly different from
tumors treated with NaCl-EP (P < 0.01) and from control
groups treated without electroporation (P < 0.0001). As
expected, ﬂuorescence intensity of the nonelectroporated
tumors increased over time. The ﬂuorescence intensity of
tumors treated with NaCl-EP decreased 2 to 3 days after
treatment and was signiﬁcantly different from that of tumors
treated with NaCl (P < 0.05); thereafter, the ﬂuorescence
intensity increased and was not signiﬁcantly different from
that of nonelectroporated tumors (Fig. 2B and C).
Histologic analysis was conducted on tissue sections, and
the fraction of necrosis was estimated. The analysis of Ca2þEP–treated tumors showed progressive necrosis, which was
highly signiﬁcant 2 days after treatment (P < 0.0001) and
complete 6 days after treatment (Fig. 3A and B).
Because Ca2þ-EP treatment leads to highly efﬁcient cell
death independently in different cell lines and also leads to
uniform necrosis across tumors within 6 days, a condition
fundamental for cell survival must be involved. Previous work
showed that ATP decreased signiﬁcantly in tissue exposed to
high-voltage pulses (13, 14). Determination of ATP levels in

cells after treatment showed that Ca2þ-EP treatment resulted
in an immediate and severe drop in ATP level (Fig. 3C). Cells
treated with electroporation alone exhibited a similar drop in
ATP level but with a marked recovery 4 hours after treatment
to levels signiﬁcantly higher than those of Ca2þ-EP–treated
cells (P < 0.0001). Calcium without electroporation did not
affect ATP levels. Cells electroporated with calcium-free physiologic saline showed a similar drop and recovery in ATP level
as cells treated with electroporation alone (data not shown).
Here, we show that calcium electroporation leads to acute
ATP depletion and cell death (in vitro) as well as massive tumor
necrosis in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4, ATP depletion in relation
to increased intracellular levels of free calcium may be caused
by greatly increased activity of the Ca2þ-ATPase, leading to
high consumption of ATP (2, 5). Furthermore, a high intracellular calcium level may induce opening of permeability transition pores (PTP) in the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in
loss of the electrochemical gradient, the driving force for ATP
production, and thereby uncoupling mitochondrial formation
of new ATP (2, 5, 6). Other cellular effects associated with
calcium overload include activation of lipases and proteases,
and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may
also contribute to cell death (2, 5, 6). Finally, the electroporation procedure itself may lead to some increased ATP consumption as the inﬂux of sodium (directly or due to sodium

A direct loss of ATP through permeabilization structures is also
a possible contributor. Together, this may result in cell death
(Fig. 4; refs. 2, 5, 6). Severe calcium overload causes cell death,
and depending on the cellular ATP level, cells undergo either
apoptosis or necrosis. If the majority of mitochondria remain
capable of ATP synthesis, the ATP loss may have a transient
nature favoring the apoptotic pathway (15–17). On the contrary, if ATP depletion is too severe for apoptosis to occur,
the cell will undergo necrosis (15–17). Our results clearly
show that calcium overload induced by calcium electroporation results in severe ATP depletion and necrosis (Fig. 3).
Electroporation has been used for local treatment of malignant tumors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents
(electrochemotherapy; refs. 11, 18) or plasmids (gene electrotransfer; ref. 7) in clinical trials. The cytotoxic agents bleomycin
or cisplatin have been used, either by i.v. or by the intratumoral route, followed by application of electric pulses to the
tumor (11, 18). Our suggestion would be to use direct intratumoral calcium injection followed by electroporation according to the standard procedures already published for electrochemotherapy (7). We found that injecting isotonic calcium
chloride corresponding to half the tumor volume followed by
electroporation was highly efﬁcient. Systemic administration
of calcium was not tested in this study, as adsorption to
plasma proteins and risk of hypercalcemia were predicted.
Because electrochemotherapy has proved efﬁcient in cutaneous tumors, electrodes facilitating the application of electro-

Electroporation (EP) generates

poration for use in colorectal cancer, bone and liver metastases, and brain tumors (19) have been developed, and are now in
clinical trials (7). Efforts are also being made to carry out
irreversible electroporation of tumors (7) in which addition of
calcium could enhance efﬁcacy. Because calcium for injection
is commercially available and regularly used at most hospitals
and electric pulses are already used clinically, this treatment
could easily be implemented. In addition, calcium has an
excellent safety proﬁle both for use in patients and for staff,
and would not need administration by staff accredited to
administer chemotherapy. Finally, cost of cancer treatment
is causing global concern (20), and calcium electroporation is
both simple and inexpensive and is likely to be of potential
beneﬁt in the treatment of local tumors regardless of histology.
