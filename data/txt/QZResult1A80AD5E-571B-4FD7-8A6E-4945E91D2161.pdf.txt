ABSTRACT:
Despite all recent advances in malignant glioma research, only modest progress
has been achieved in improving patient prognosis and quality of life. Such a clinical
scenario underscores the importance of investing in new therapeutic approaches
that, when combined with conventional therapies, are able to effectively eradicate
glioma infiltration and target distant tumor foci. Nanoparticle-loaded delivery systems
have recently arisen as an exciting alternative to improve targeted anti-glioma drug
delivery. As drug carriers, they are able to efficiently protect the therapeutic agent and
allow for sustained drug release. In addition, their surface can be easily manipulated
with the addition of special ligands, which are responsible for enhancing tumorspecific nanoparticle permeability. However, their inefficient intratumoral distribution
and failure to target disseminated tumor burden still pose a big challenge for their
implementation as a therapeutic option in the clinical setting. Stem cell-based delivery
of drug-loaded nanoparticles offers an interesting option to overcome such issues.
Their ability to incorporate nanoparticles and migrate throughout interstitial barriers,
together with their inherent tumor-tropic properties and synergistic anti-tumor effects
make these stem cell carriers a good fit for such combined therapy. In this review, we
will describe the main nanoparticle delivery systems that are presently available in
preclinical and clinical studies. We will discuss their mechanisms of targeting, current
delivery methods, attractive features and pitfalls. We will also debate the potential
applications of stem cell carriers loaded with therapeutic nanoparticles in anticancer
therapy and why such an attractive combined approach has not yet reached clinical
trials.

1. INTRODUCTION

that surrounds the central nervous system (CNS). In
addition, the few chemotherapeutic agents that are able
to reach the brain post-systemic administration usually do
not get to the tumor site at a concentration high enough
to kill infiltrative tumor cells without damaging nonneoplastic tissues [3]. Last, cancer stem cells, which have
been shown to play a major role in therapeutic relapse
and tumor recurrence, have proven to be resistant to the
current standard therapies [4].
Several efforts have been made to overcome these
obstacles. Among them, the development of nanoparticle
delivery systems has offered a new hope in obtaining
efficient and effective therapeutic distribution. Most of
the newly engineered nanoparticles are able to cross the

Glioblastoma multiforme, the most common
primary brain tumor in adults, is characterized by a highly
invasive phenotype and invariable recurrence. Despite
aggressive standard therapy, which consists of surgical
resection, followed by chemo- and radiotherapy, the
median survival remains only 14.6 months [1, 2]. Several
problems have been held responsible for such a dismal
prognosis. First, due to diffuse malignant infiltration
into white matter tracts, complete surgical extirpation
of the tumor is considered impossible. Second, most
effective drugs available in the market are not able to
cross the extremely selective blood-brain barrier (BBB)

BBB and accumulate within the tumor. Their surface can
be functionalized in order to enhance a targeted delivery
to neoplastic tissues [5]. These nanocarriers can also be
loaded with a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic
agents, allowing for effective uptake across the BBB of
previously non-diffusible chemotherapeutic drugs [6, 7].
Moreover, their versatile structure allows for the loading
of a high number of therapeutic agents per nanocarrier,
which, together with a targeted delivery, increases the
amount of drugs that accumulate at the tumor site, and
decreases toxicity to normal tissues. As a result of such
superior delivery, this new therapeutic approach has
proven to target both chemoresistant cancer stem cells and
rapidly dividing malignant cells [8].
Although powerful tools for both diagnosis and
treatment of brain tumors, nanoparticle delivery systems
alone present several drawbacks that hamper complete
tumor eradication. First, depending on the size of the
carrier, cells from the mononuclear phagocyte system,
such as macrophages and lymphocytes, can easily engulf
them, which decreases the amount of systemically
administered nanoparticles that effectively reach the
tumor area [9, 10]. Second, upon reaching glioma tissues,
nanoparticle systems may experience uneven intratumoral
distribution due to entrapment in the extracellular matrix

space surrounding neoplastic cells or within intratumoral
necrotic pockets. Third, although these carriers are able to
reach the tumor site, they are mostly unable to effectively
target infiltrative areas.
The use of stem cell carriers loaded with
nanoparticle delivery systems has recently been presented
as a solution to overcome the above limitations. They
have proven to be effective delivery vehicles for many
therapeutic systems, including nanoparticles [11-14]. They
can be loaded with a fair amount of these nanocarriers,
while keeping their inherent tumor-tropic properties. In
addition, they are able to migrate within glioma tissue,
providing increased intratumoral distribution of the
therapeutic payload and targeted migration to infiltrative
tumor areas [11]. They were shown to protect these
therapeutic agents from the host immunosurveillance,
decreasing their unrestricted uptake by mononuclear cells.
Furthermore, they possess intrinsic immunosuppressive
properties, which have been shown to decrease tumor
inflammation and improve therapeutic index [15]. In this
review, we will describe the main nanoparticle delivery
systems that are presently available in preclinical and
clinical studies. We will discuss their mechanisms of
targeting, current delivery methods, attractive features and
pitfalls. We will also debate the potential applications of

cell carriers. Three mechanisms of nanoparticle incorporation into cell carriers are depicted here: caveolin-mediated endocytosis,

clathrin-mediated endocytosis and passive transport. Drug-loaded nanocarriers coated with cationic charges or tumor-specific ligands
are incorporated into stem cells. By different mechanisms (see text) endo-lysosomal escape takes place. Drug-loaded nanoparticles then
accumulate in the cytosol. Nanoparticle accumulation and sustained drug release in the cytoplasm of the cell carrier leads to membrane
disruption and targeted drug release to tumor cells.

2.1. Liposomes

stem cell carriers loaded with therapeutic nanoparticles in
anticancer therapy and why such an attractive combined
approach has not yet reached clinical trials.

Liposomes are spherical polymeric vesicles made
up of a lipid bilayer, and range in size from 100 nm to
5 µm in diameter [20]. Liposomes have the ability to
carry hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules [21]. One
major advantage of liposomes is that they are easily
manipulated during their synthesis process [16]. By taking
advantage of this, many liposomes have been constructed
to be temperature- or pH-sensitive, allowing for regulated
release of their contents [22]. Moreover, due to their
physiochemical characteristics, liposomes have long blood
circulation times and favorable diffusion properties [23].

2. Nanoplatforms
Nanoparticle platforms are defined by their
physicochemical structure that gives them their unique
and multifunctional properties. At their foundation,
nanoparticles are materials that range from one to a
hundred nanometers in at least one dimension, have a
large surface to volume ratio, and can, to some extent,
cross the BBB [16-18]. Beyond these commonalities, a
huge diversity of nanoparticle systems has been developed
to possess different shapes, sizes, chemical properties,
and biofunctional compositions that render them unique
from one another [19]. In the following section, we will
describe the most widely studied organic and inorganic
nanoparticles in the context of glioma therapy [17].

2.2. Micelles
Micelles range in size from 20 nm to 200 nm
in diameter, and are formulated from lipids or other
amphiphilic molecules. These nanostructures have a
hydrophobic core with a hydrophilic exterior [21], which
has the advantage of rendering insoluble therapeutic
agents soluble in biologic environments [24]. The outer

migration results in a targeted drug release in infiltrative tumor zones. Modified cell carriers contribute to the local toxic effects caused
by the drug-loaded system in neoplastic areas. Stem cells’ immunosuppressive properties hide loaded nanocarriers from the host-immune
system and facilitate targeted anti-glioma therapy.

2.6. Gold nanoparticles

shell of a micelle provides added protection over freely
administered therapeutics, thus increasing the amount
delivered to the intended target [25]. Furthermore, micelles
can be structurally and chemically modified to respond
to various environmental stimuli (i.e. pH, temperature)
therefore regimenting therapeutic release [26].

Gold nanoparticles consist of self-assembled gold
atoms that range in size from 1-150 nm in diameter [33].
The synthesis of gold nanoparticles results in high reaction
yields with a consistent nanoparticle size, shape, and mass
[34]. Gold nanoparticles are thought to be biologically
inert and therefore have a low toxicity and high
biocompatibility [35]. Another advantageous characteristic
of gold nanoparticles is their strong optical property, due
to surface plasmon resonance, that is detectable in the
visible region of the light spectrum [36]. Lastly, because
of the surface chemistry of gold nanoparticles functional
diversity can be achieved with relative simplicity [37].

2.3. Polymeric nanoparticles
Polymeric nanoparticles are assembled from
either natural or synthetic polymers and may be the
best nanoparticles for long-term therapeutic delivery
[16]. These nanocarriers have a hydrophobic core with
a large loading capacity, and a hydrophilic shell that
provides stability and protection [27]. They have been
designed to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
molecules, as well as macromolecules such as proteins
and nucleic acids [28]. Polymers have demonstrated
low levels of toxicity, and are naturally metabolized and
secreted from the body [16]. Lastly, break-down and
release of therapeutics can be regulated in a controlled
manner by altering the physiochemical properties of the
nanoparticle, such as its molecular weight, dispersity
index, hydrophobicity, and crystallinity [16].

3. Nanoparticle delivery in glioma therapy
The inherent nature of glioma presents several
distinct challenges for the successful delivery of
therapeutics. Primary targeting is the first major obstacle
and involves delivering nanoparticles past the highly
discriminating BBB; a physiological barrier of the brain
that limits unrestricted diffusional movement of molecules
into and out of the brain [38]. The second challenge is
specifically targeting glioma cells such as the aggressively
infiltrative cells that have left the primary tumor site
and spread throughout the brain. These invasive cells
eventually give rise to recurrent disease [39]. This is
referred to as secondary targeting. The following section
will review the ways nanoparticle systems have aimed
to overcome these challenges, and outlines the major
roadblocks that still remain to be resolved.

2.4. Dendrimers
Dendrimers are polymer-based nanoparticles that
range in size from 5-10 nm in diameter and contain
extensive branching arms and multivalent functional
groups. The tree-like structure of dendrimers allows
for multifunctional properties. Dendrimers are capable
of enclosing therapeutics within their structure, while
anchoring imaging agents and targeting molecules to
its periphery. Additionally, controlled degradation of
dendrimers and release of therapeutics can be achieved
through the thoughtful choice of their polymer chain
chemistry [29].

3.1. Primary targeting - the brain
Nanoparticles have been delivered to malignant
gliomas both systemically and locally. Systemic delivery
of nanoparticles via intravenous injection requires efficient
transport through the systemic circulation and across
the BBB in order to deliver therapeutics at an optimal
distribution and therapeutic concentration into the CNS
[23]. Local delivery circumvents the BBB and relies
on the diffusion of nanoparticles directly into the brain
parenchyma [40].

2.5. Iron oxide nanoparticles
Iron oxide nanoparticles are magnetic nanoparticles
that have a diameter of 10-100 nm [21]. The chemical
properties of iron oxide nanoparticle surface modifications,
such as inorganic silica or natural polymers, are required
to stabilize the nanoparticle and are also used to attach
ligands for targeting [30]. The relaxivity of the core of
iron oxide nanoparticles makes them particularly potent
magnetic resonance contrast agents [31]. A recent study
has shown that the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles (SPIONs) for magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) as compared with conventional MRI contrast
agents, increased both the diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity in the detection of metastatic tumors [17].
Magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) is a therapeutic application
of iron oxide nanoparticles that takes advantage of their
magnetic properties [32].

Systemic Delivery
Intravenous injection is the most widely used
method to deliver nanoparticles to the brain because
of its non-invasive nature [41]. Although intravenous
administration presents a viable option, nanoparticle
delivery is hindered because of clearance by the
mononuclear phagocyte system [42]. To circumvent this,
nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm with amphipathic
poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) surface modifications have
been shown to mitigate macrophage recognition and
increase blood circulation half-life. However, the lack of
an inclusive study of this effect across multiple cell lines
and animal models has created conflicting results [42, 43].

3.2. Secondary targeting - the glioma cell

Furthermore, to address the issue surrounding the BBB,
it has been reported that BBB penetrance occurs with
nanoparticles in the 15-100 nm range but optimal passage
occurs with nanoparticles ≤15 nm in size. Therefore,
particle size poses a clear limitation on what type of
nanocarriers can be utilized for brain tumor diagnosis and
treatment [44-46].
Beyond particle size, nanoparticles have been
modified with cationic bovine serum albumin (CBSA),
aclarubicin-loaded CBSA, or polysobate 80 surfactant,
and these modifications have resulted in more robust
levels of nanoparticle accumulation within the brain [7,
47, 48]. Also, modifying nanoparticles with lipophilic
additives reduces their surface charge therefore binding
apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can enhance BBB uptake
[49, 50]. Although these modifications help to increase
the uptake of nanoparticles into the brain, local injection
methods have generated a greater accumulation of
nanoparticles in this organ [41].

The ability to specifically target glioma cells either
within the primary tumor or cells that have diffused deeply
throughout the normal brain tissue is a complex challenge.
One way nanoparticles may overcome this obstacle
is through passive targeting. Passive targeting occurs
naturally through the enhanced permeability and retention
effect (EPR). The second tactic is active targeting which
involves functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with
glioma-specific targeting moieties.
Passive targeting - enhanced permeability and
retention effect
The enhanced permeability and retention effect
(EPR) is a phenomenon involving solid tumors where
their porous vasculature and secretion of elevated levels
of vascular permeability factors create an environment
that promotes tumor growth (i.e. necessary levels of
oxygen and nutrients) [60]. Since the onset of this
discovery, cancer therapies have exploited the distinct
tumor microenvironment to deliver therapeutics to cancer
tissue [61]. Within the context of brain tumors, passive
targeting is especially significant as glioma vasculature is
considerably hypervascularized, leaky, and deficient of a
proper lymphatic drainage system. This creates an ideal
environment for the uptake and retention of nanoparticles
in tumor tissues, while sparing healthy brain cells [62]. It
has been shown that passive targeting can be enhanced
by localizing supermagnetic nanoparticles within glioma
through an externally applied magnetic field [63]. In
one study using this approach, magnetic paclitaxel
nanoparticles significantly increased the survival of
glioma-bearing rats when compared with free paclitaxel
[64]. Regardless, the efficacy of EPR-based nanoparticle
delivery for glioma therapy is still under question because
of glioma’s pathophysiological heterogeneity. It has
been well reported that the core of gliomas consists of
hypovascularized or necrotic tissue. Therefore, these
central areas of the tumor do not exhibit an active EPR
effect [65]. Moreover, it is thought that the existence of
a “hypoxic niche” supports the small subpopulation of

Local Delivery
Local or direct bolus injection of nanoparticles is
an alternative delivery method that bypasses the systemic
circulation and BBB altogether [41]. A major disadvantage
of this delivery technique stems from the tightly packed
cells in the brain matter that results in low diffusion
coefficients and causes sluggish diffusion and backflow
of the injected nanoparticles [41, 51]. Additionally, high
intracellular fluid pressure in gliomas further restricts
local delivery [52, 53]. In order to correct these issues,
a technique called convection-enhanced delivery (CED)
has been applied with local injection of nanoparticles to
create a pressure-driven gradient that drives nanoparticle
diffusion [54, 55]. CED has shown encouraging results in
experimental animal models [56]. However, issues such
as the limited amount of time CED can be applied [57],
variable distribution, as well as safety concerns, render
CED as a questionable mode of delivery of nanoparticles
to glioma tissues [58, 59].

tumor stem cells that are responsible for glioma growth,
progression, and disease recurrence [66, 67]. The access of
nanoparticles to the hypoxic core may therefore be crucial
for therapeutic impact.

inter-tumoral heterogeneity as well as the aggressiveness
of infiltrating tumor cells continue to challenge the success
of nanoparticle systems.
Even after the implementation of CED as an attempt
to overcome the shortcomings of the local delivery, the use
of nanoplatforms alone in anti-cancer therapy still faces
some important challenges such as uneven intratumoral
distribution and ineffective targeting of distant tumor foci.
One possible way to overcome these problems is the use
of cell carriers as vehicles for drug-loaded nanoparticle
delivery to the targeted tumor site. Amongst other cell
carriers, neural and mesenchymal stem cells (NSCs
and MSC, respectively) are especially attractive for this
application because they have proven to be permissive to
nanoparticle incorporation, immunoprotective, and tumor
tropic. These specific stem cell properties make delivery
of nanoparticle payloads to targeted tumor areas in an
optimal concentration a realistic possibility. Moreover,
their unique oncotropic property allows them to target
distant tumor foci, and potentially decrease the levels
of tumor recurrence. As a result, stem cell carriers seem
to be more suitable as delivery vehicles for anticancer
therapy when compared to other options. In the following
sections, we will survey stem cells as tumor-specific
carriers of drug-loaded nanoparticles, as well as address
their synergistic effect in anti-glioma therapy and the main
limitations related to such an approach.

Active Targeting - functionalizing the surface of
nanoparticles
Active targeting involves functionalizing the surface
of nanoparticles by attaching ligands or antibodies specific
to glioma on their surface [68]. Several nanoparticles
utilizing active targeting have been developed for glioma
treatment both in vitro and in vivo. In one in vitro study,
an antibody specific to interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2
(IL-13Rα2) (a receptor up-regulated in glioma cells) was
attached to the surface of nanoparticles and demonstrated
tumor specificity and toxicity in U373 and U87 glioma cell
lines [69]. Additionally, Madhankumar et al. used an IL13 conjugated nanoliposome to target U251 glioma cells
in vitro and revealed increased internalization compared
to their unconjugated counterpart. In an intracranial
animal model using human U87 cells, this functionalized
nanoparticle system resulted in a 5-fold reduction in
intracranial tumor volume as well as significantly extended
survival compared to animals receiving unconjugated
liposomes [70]. In another study, carbon nanotubes were
functionalized with the monoclonal antibody CD133+, a
marker thought to be specific for glioma stem cells [71].
This study revealed the ability to selectively target and
destroy CD133+ glioma stem cells and not CD133- cells, as
well as thwart their tumorigenic and self-renewal capacity
in vitro. Furthermore, similar antitumoral effects were
exhibited in a xenograft nude mouse model [72]. Another
moiety used in active nanoparticle targeting of glioma is
the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) epidermal growth
factor receptor vIII (EGFRvIII). It has been shown that
elevated levels of EGFR protein and EGFR amplification
are present in 40-60% of glioblastomas [73]. The results
of one study using an EGFRvIII antibody-conjugated
iron oxide nanoparticle exhibited survival efficacy and
served as a suitable targeted therapy towards infiltrative
glioblastoma [74]. Beyond antibodies and antigens,
ligands have also been used for active targeting of
nanoparticles in glioma therapy. For example, a polymeric
nanoparticle introducing a plasmid encoding proapoptotic
Apo2 ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) repressed tumor growth
and lengthened survival in a C6 murine glioma model
[75]. Lastly, Kang et al. have developed a polymer based
nanoparticle modified with a transferrin (Tf) ligand that
precisely binds to the Tf receptor which is upregulated
on the surface of proliferating glioma cells [76]. This
nanoparticle system revealed improved cytotoxicity and
extended survival of C6 tumor-bearing rats by an average
of 88.37% when treated at an early stage of disease
progression [77]. Despite the progress made with active
nanoparticle targeting, glioma’s prodigious intra- and

4. Stem cells as carriers of nanoparticle-delivery
systems
4.1 Neural stem cells
NSCs are defined by their ability to self-renew and
differentiate into neurons, astrocyte, and oligodendrocytes,
the three major cell types in the CNS. In the adult brain,
they are located within the subventricular zone and the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These cells demonstrate
homing behavior towards glioma cells both in vitro and in
vivo [11, 78, 79]. NSCs have already begun to make their
way into clinical trials in the field of regenerative medicine
for diseases such as ALS, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke
[80]. Information about their fate and migratory abilities
gained from these studies will no doubt be important for
further advances in delivery of anti-cancer agents using
stem cells. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
also recently approved the HB1.F3.CD NSC line for their
evaluation in clinical trials for the treatment of malignant
gliomas. The goal of the study is to evaluate the safety
of NSCs expressing the suicide gene cytosine deaminase
(CD), which can convert the pro-drug 5-Fluorocytosine to
the active drug 5-Fluorocytosine (NCT01172964). Other
therapeutic agents, including oncolytic viruses, have
already been loaded in NSCs to target gliomas in animal
models, and further clinical studies in patients with brain
cancer may be on the horizon [11, 81]. As these clinical
383

challenges of using NSCs for therapeutics delivery will
become evident.

cells, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, expression
of MHC-I (major histocompatibility class I) and absence
of MHC-II antigens [102]. The last two mechanisms,
respectively, are responsible for the protection of stem
cell carriers from natural killer (NK) cells, and allow for
immune evasion from CD4+ lymphocytes [15]. Therefore,
both the tumortropic and immunosuppressive properties of
stem cell carriers make them excellent choices for targeted
anti-glioma therapy.

4.2 Mesenchymal stem cells
MSCs are multipotent cells typically found in
the bone marrow [82] that can give rise to a variety of
cell types including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and
adipocytes [83]. They have been isolated from many
locations including bone marrow, peripheral blood, lung,
adipose tissue, as well as a variety of other sites [8488]. These stem cells have also exhibited tumor-homing
capabilities both in vitro and in vivo [89-92], suggesting
their potential as therapeutic carriers. Many studies
have loaded non-nanoparticle therapeutic agents into
MSCs to target malignant gliomas [89-91, 93, 94]. For
example, Kosaka et al. reported that MSCs expressing
CD and concurrent 5-fluorocytosine administration could
improve the survival of rats bearing 9L gliomas [94].
Another report by Ryu et al. demonstrated that MSCs
loaded with herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase
could increase the survival of glioma-bearing mice [93].
There are also a number of clinical trials that have already
used MSCs for therapeutic delivery or for regenerative
purposes, including chronic ischemic stroke and ALS [80]
(NCT01051882; NCT01287936). Even though they are
not aimed at treating malignant gliomas, lessons learned
from these current studies will provide critical insight into
the efficacy, fate and safety of these cell types.

4.4. Incorporation of nanoparticles into the cell carrier:
trafficking and storage
Nanoparticle uptake by stem cell carriers can be
variable depending on several factors including the type
of particle, size, and surface charge. Furthermore, several
uptake mechanisms may be at play simultaneously. Some
possible uptake mechanisms include passive Brownian
diffusion into the cell, protein-mediated transport,
clathrin-mediated, and caveolin-mediated endocytosis.
Nativo et al. demonstrated that surface modifications of
gold nanoparticles using cell penetrating peptides could
affect their intracellular distribution, suggesting changes in
uptake mechanisms [103]. Silica nanoparticles, however,
were shown to interact with the lipid membrane of large
unilamellar liposomes, inducing transmigration [104].
Mesoporous silica and polystyrene nanoparticles have
been assimilated by ovarian cancer cells via caveolinmediated endocytosis [105]. Once inside the cells,
drug-loaded nanoparticles are transported to the endolysosomal system, where they are destroyed. Due to
secondary changes in their surface charge, which leads
to an interaction between nanoparticles and lysosomal
membrane, polylactide (PLA) and polyglycolide (PLGA)
polymer nanoplatforms are able to disrupt the lysosomal
membrane and escape into the cytoplasm, where they
accumulate [106]. Lipid nanoparticles, in turn, suffer
lysosomal escape through direct interaction of their
outmost coat, the hydroxystearate of poly(ethylene glycol)
(HS-PEG), with the membrane of the lysosome [107].
Nanoparticle accumulation and sustained drug release
in the cytoplasm of the cell carrier leads to membrane
disruption and targeted drug release in tumor cells (Figure
1). The study of the means by which nanocarriers are
assimilated and trafficked into stem cells is still in its
infancy. A deep understanding of the uptake mechanism
of most nanoparticle systems is still lacking, and if more
analyses are conducted in this arena, it might provide
insight on how to optimize uptake and distribution of these
particles.

4. 3. Tumortropic and immunosuppressive properties
of stem cell carriers
In the context of malignant gliomas, stem cells
may provide a more targeted delivery method over other
previously described cell carriers, such as macrophages
[95], endothelial cells [96], cytokine-induced killer
(CIK) cells [97], dendritic cells [98], monocytes [96] and
T-cells [98, 99] . MSCs and NSCs have demonstrated
homing behavior towards glioma cells both in vitro
and in vivo [11, 78, 79, 89-92]. Not only do these cells
migrate and distribute themselves within the tumor bed
after a short time period, NSCs and MSCs also appeared
to trail invading cancer cells [78]. The mechanisms of
this migratory behavior are still unclear but have been
shown to involve signaling pathways including the SDF-1
(stromal cell-derived factor-1)/CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine
receptor type 4) system [100] as well as other signaling
pathways involving uPA/uPAR (urokinase receptor),
VEGF/VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial cell growth factor
receptor 2), and c-Met (pro-oncogene) receptors [101].
Because of this targeted migratory ability, it is thought
that stem cells might act as carriers of therapeutic agents,
including nanoparticles. Another important characteristic
of both MSCs and NSCs that makes them attractive cell
carriers is their intrinsic immunosuppressive properties.
Such immunosuppression can be explained by four main
mechanisms: promotion of apoptosis of type 1 T-helper

5. Delivery methods of stem cells to the brain
5.1. Intracranial injection
Most of the current clinical trials using NSCs involve
direct perioperative intracranial injections [80, 108]
384

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 378-396

(NSC01172964; NCT01151124; NCT01005004) (Figure
2). Patients with Batten disease, for example, received
multiple subcortical and intraventricular injections of
NSCs, and the number of cells injected was found to be
well tolerated with the use of immunosuppressant therapy.
However, if this injection method is to be used effectively
for brain tumor diagnosis and therapy, stem cells loaded
with therapeutic agents will need to demonstrate increased
efficacy over intratumoral injections of the therapeutic
agent alone. It is possible that the ability of these cells
to distribute themselves within the tumor and track down
invading cells may lead to enhanced efficacy.

[114]. There was no tumor or abnormal cell growth in
these patients over 1 year. Nevertheless, this intravenous
delivery method brings up some obvious concerns
surrounding the distribution of these cells. More work
must be done to study the biodistribution and fate of these
intravenously injected cells.

5.2. Intranasal injection

MSCs have demonstrated the ability to express
transgenes efficiently without any alteration of their
tumortropic or immunosuppressive properties [115]. Such
competent expression may offer an anti-cancer therapy
where the product of a gene within a stem cell could be
used to target surrounding glioma tissues. Gene therapy
usually relies on the use of viral vectors as transporters
to deliver the desired gene to cell carriers. However,
this method faces many limitations, including infectionrelated cell damage and immune response issues [116].
Nanoparticles bound with DNA avoid many of these
problems and have shown promise for gene delivery into
stem cell carriers. Park et al. developed polyethylenimine
(PEI)-DNA coated silica nanoparticles for gene delivery
into hMSCs [117]. The authors reported that 75% of
hMSCs showed uptake of this vehicle. In another study,
the same group demonstrated that PEI polyplexed
with transcription factor SOX 5, 6, and 9 coated onto
PLGA nanoparticles led to a significant increase in
chondrogenesis of hMSCs in vitro [118]. Yang et al.
delivered the hVEGF gene to hMSCs using biodegradable
poly beta-amino ester nanoparticles, leading to enhanced
VEGF production in these cells. This led to enhanced
angiogenesis and limb salvage [119]. Although such
reports were not specific to glioma therapy, the concept
of nanoparticle-mediated gene delivery to stem cells may
be of value if anti-glioma genes can be incorporated onto
nanoparticle transporters. The goal of such transporters
would be to enhance gene uptake by stem cells without the
limitations found in viral gene delivery, a method already
demonstrated in the treatment of glioma [11, 81].

6. Currently available methods incorporating
nanoparticles and stem cell carriers
6.1. Gene therapy

Intranasal delivery of stem cells has also been
demonstrated as a less invasive method of transporting
these cells into the CNS. Danielyan et al. delivered
MSCs to the brains of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
unilaterally lesioned rats, a model of Parkinson Disease
[109]. The authors noted distribution of MSCs throughout
the CNS and increased tyrosine hydroxylase levels in
the lesioned ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra,
leading to behavior improvements. Importantly, 24% of
the injected MSCs survived in these rats for at least 4.5
months, suggesting long-term integration and survival of
injected cells. Velthoven et al. used intranasal delivery
of MSCs in the context of CNS ischemia [110]. It was
noted that these MSCs could reduce lesion size and induce
functional recovery in a cerebral hypoxia-ischemia mouse
model. Intranasal injection of stem cell carriers has also
been described in the context of malignant gliomas.
In a recent report, Reitz et al. analyzed the tumortropic
and migratory pathways of human- and murine-derived
NSCs after intranasal administration in mice bearing
intracerebral glioblastomas. Intranasally delivered NSCs
displayed a rapid and targeted tumor tropism, with most
of the cells reaching the glioma site within 6 hours after
injection. Histological sections revealed the olfactory
bulb and the microvasculature of the nasal mucosa as the
two main pathways of stem cell migration [111]. Taken
together, these studies provide key insight into an effective
and less invasive method for introducing stem cells into
the CNS.
5.3. Intravenous injection

6.2. Labeling of stem cells to track migration

Aboody et al. first demonstrated that intravenously
injected NSCs could migrate to brain tumors in a nude
mouse xenograft glioma model. However, the authors
did mention that such a delivery method resulted in
low migration efficiency [78]. Intravenous-injected
MSCs have already been used in clinical trials for other
neurological diseases such as stroke. Bang et al. described
a randomized clinical trial in which stroke patients were
injected intravenously with MSCs, and no adverse events
were noted in these 5 patients by 5-years [112, 113].
Honmou et al. reported 12 stroke patients who were
injected intravenously with bone marrow-derived MSCs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Labeling of stem cells with nanoparticles to track
their migration is one of the best-established combinations
of nanoparticles and stem cells in the field of medical
imaging. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles such as
SPIOs have been commonly used to enhance imaging in
addition to other non-iron particles including manganese
oxide nanoparticles and gadolinium chelates attached to
the surface of nanoparticles [120]. SPIOs have also been
used to track the migration of stem cells and demonstrate
the migratory path towards tumors [92, 120]. Wu et al.
demonstrated that while initially MSCs were scattered
385

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 378-396

throughout the tumor at early stages after injection, after
14 days the MSCs were found at the border between tumor
and normal parenchyma [92]. Thus, such cells loaded
with SPIOs may offer a more efficient way of delineating
the boundaries of the tumor using MRI. Flexman et al.
provided a quantitative analysis of the migration of
NSCs loaded with ferumoxide (SPIO + dextran) and
found that NSCs typically migrate at a speed of 50-70
µm/day depending on the brain region [121]. The study
also claimed to be able to distinguish cell migration from
clearance or degradation of cell debris and free tracer.
It has also been demonstrated that nanoparticle systems
such as ferumoxide do not disrupt the migratory ability
of MSCs towards glioma cells [122]. Concerning the
NSC line newly approved for clinical trials, Thu et al.
demonstrated that loading with ferumoxide-protamine
sulfate complex nanoparticles did not change the migration
properties of HB1.F3.CD cells. These results support the
use of nanoparticles to improve our understanding of the
distribution of stem cells systemically and throughout the
brain and help delineate the migratory mechanism of cell
carriers to tumor burdens, and support their use in future
clinical studies [123].

conducted in order to show that stem cells improve the
efficacy of free-standing nanoparticle systems.
6.4. Modulation of stem cell behavior
The behavior and characteristics of stem cells may
be altered by loaded nanoparticles, offering new avenues
for therapy. Chung et al. in a recent report demonstrated
that MSCs loaded with iron oxide nanoparticles showed
increased EGFR expression [127]. This resulted in more
efficient MSC migration towards tumor cells. It also
allowed MSCs to interfere with tumor EGF/EGFR growth
signaling, tumor angiogenesis, and VEGF expression.
Although this was demonstrated in the context of colon
cancer, such strategies could be used to target malignant
gliomas as EGFR has been shown to be amplified
in glioblastoma multiforme [128]. It has also been
demonstrated that ferucarbotran-protamine complexlabeled hMSCs had a higher expression of CXCR4,
a receptor that is thought to be critical for stem cell
migration towards glioma cells [129]. Such modifications
to stem cells could improve migration efficiency and offer
unique ways of targeting malignant gliomas.

7. Challenges and potential pitfalls of
nanoparticle-loaded stem cells in anti-glioma
therapy

6.3. Delivery of toxic agents
One of the major challenges of the stem cellnanoparticle partnership is developing ways to deliver
toxic compounds to areas of the tumor in a specific manner
while preserving carrier migration. Li et al. demonstrated
that silica nanorattle-doxorubicin particles could be
anchored to MSCs in a system called “nanoparticulate
patches” [124]. Loaded cells were able to migrate towards
U251 cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
this system demonstrated more widespread apoptosis at
7 days post-intratumoral injection of silica nanoparticledoxorubicin loaded MSCs when compared to injections
of free doxorubicin.
Roger et al. demonstrated that marrow-isolated adult
multilineage inducible cells (MIAMI cells) containing
ferrociphenol could induce cytotoxicity in U87MG glioma
cells in vitro via a transwell system assay [125]. Tumors
treated with this delivery system showed decreased growth
rates in vivo. Nevertheless, the results were not very
robust and survival improvements of the animals were
not discussed. In addition, the authors did not mention
toxicity improvements of the stem cell-nanoparticle
combination therapy over treatment with stem cells alone.
In a report from Rachakatla et al., neural progenitor cells
were loaded with magnetic nanoparticles and delivered
to mice with melanoma. Using an alternating magnetic
field, hyperthermia was induced and significant tumor
attenuation was observed [126]. A similar strategy might
prove effective for glioma targeting. Results thus far
combining stem cells and nanoparticles for the induction
of toxicity towards glioma cells demonstrate a simple and
promising proof-of-concept, but more work needs to be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The use of nanoparticles may offer improvements
for glioma therapy on several fronts. They can bring
the added benefit of enhancing tumor imaging while
simultaneously causing toxicity to glioma cells. Stem cells
could provide the effective targeted delivery mechanism
that is currently lacking in nanomedicine. However, there
are challenges that must be overcome in order to develop
effective therapeutic systems using such a combination.
Highlighted are some limitations that need to be addressed
(Table 1).
7.1. Toxicological issues
Every year bigger investments have been directed to
the development of new nanoparticle delivery systems for
anti-cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the possible effects of
these nanocarriers on the tumor microenvironment and on
the host biology have not yet been fully clarified. Recent
data have suggested that the physiochemical properties
of nanoparticles may lead to unpredictable biological
interactions and undesirable toxicity. Pan Y et al. have
demonstrated the existence of size-dependent nanoparticle
cytotoxicity. In this study, small sized gold nanoparticles
(1.4 nm) were shown to induce programmed cell death
by intercalating into the DNA major groove. However,
larger gold nanocarriers (more than 15 nm) demonstrated
no toxicity [130]. Another report has revealed the
propensity of single-walled carbon nanotubes to disrupt
the nuclear mitotic spindle apparatus and thus interfere
with cell division [131]. The relative surface area and the
386

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 378-396

coating of a nanocarrier have also been correlated with
cytotoxic effects. Monteiller et al. recently determined
the role of surface area on the pro-inflammatory effects
of low-toxicity low-solubility nanoplatforms. They
have shown both in vivo and in vitro that the high
surface area of a nanoparticle was a key factor in their
inflammogenicity [132]. Similarly, Valhov H et al. and
Kagen VE et al., respectively, showed that endotoxin
adherence on a nanoparticle’s surface as well as transition
metal contamination during its production could result
in unwanted adverse reactions [133, 134]. Nanocarrierrelated toxicity can also occur due to ROS (reactive
oxygen species) generation. Many mechanisms have
been proposed to explain such an event. Amongst them,
the presence of metal contaminants, particle dissolution
after internalization in the cell and membrane damage
by bigger nanoplatforms have been directly related with
ROS production and cell death [135]. However, toxicity
caused by nanoparticles has not only been correlated with
off-target effects. New cancer immunotherapies have been
taking advantage of immunogenic nanomaterials to induce
host vaccination [136]. Therefore, nanocarriers can be
used to both deliver the therapeutic agent and activate the
immune system against the tumor.

therapeutic regimens in order to target different disease
pathways, surpass difficulties imposed by tumor biology
and microenvironment and increase both safety and
therapeutic efficacy.
7.3. Migration efficiency of nanoparticle-loaded cell
carriers towards neoplastic tissues
The loading efficiency of nanocarriers into stem
cells can be low. Therefore, in order to be able to deliver
a therapeutically effective drug dose, a sufficient number
of cells must migrate to the targeted tumor area. Although
stem cells have demonstrated an ability to migrate
towards glioma cells, the migration efficiency is still
considered low [78]. To overcome this issue, methods
need to be developed to increase the pool of migrating
stem cells. Klopp et al. demonstrated that tumor irradiation
increased the recruitment of circulating MSCs into the
tumor microenvironment [141]. Pre-treatment with
irradiation may thus offer a way to increase the number
of migrating cells in a future therapy. Growth factor
injection or chemokine co-injection may also activate
certain stem cells to become more migratory. Kendall et al.
demonstrated that several signaling molecules produced
by glioma cells activate the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) pathway [142]. Stimulation of this pathway may
enhance the sensitivity of these cells towards signals
produced by the tumor. The type of stem cell used may
also influence the migration efficiency of nanoparticleloaded cell carriers. NSCs may be more suited for delivery
of nanoparticles to glioma when compared to other stem
cell types. Ahmed et al. found that NSCs loaded with
an oncolytic adenovirus displayed more tumor-specific
migration when compared to MSCs carrying the same
virus [11]. A further understanding of the signaling
pathways mediating stem cell migration may offer a means
of increasing the migrating pool of stem cells in the future.

7.2. Evaluation of efficacy and safety
The efficacy of a nanoparticle-delivery system can
be affected by its shape, size, stability, density, solubility,
and surface charge. Therapeutic efficacy has also shown
to be directly correlated with the drug-release profile.
Consequently, the mechanism that triggers drug release
may influence the bioavailability and biodistribution
of the therapeutic agent [137, 138]. A couple of clinical
trials have tested both efficacy and safety of some
specific nanomedicines in anti-cancer therapy. They have
demonstrated that nanoparticle uptake also depends on
the tumor microenvironment and vascularization, which
facilitates the uptake of drug-loaded nanocarriers. A
phase III clinical trial compared the efficacy of pegylatedliposomal doxorubicin versus the combination of
doxorubicin, bleomycin and vincristine in 258 patients
with advanced Kaposi’s sarcoma, a highly vascularized
tumor. A clear-cut improvement in therapeutic response,
overall survival and decreased off-site toxicity was
observed in the group treated with pegylated-liposomal
doxorubicin [139]. On the other hand, a phase III
trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pegylatedliposomal doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone in
patients with metastatic breast cancer showed decreased
cardiotoxicity, but was unable to show an increased
therapeutic effect of drug-loaded nanoparticles compared
to free doxorubicin [140]. The above results indicate
that multiple factors influence both efficacy and safety
of drug-loaded nanocarriers. Therefore, future studies
should focus on the development of more biocompatible
nanoplatforms that would be able to facilitate combined
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

7.4. Maintaining optimal drug stability and release
To be effective, a therapeutic agent must first be
stably loaded inside the cell carrier and then be released
into the extracellular space. Rather than just a quick
drug release, a slow and steady discharge is necessary
in order to reach as many tumor cells as possible. Both
drug stability and controlled release are dependent on
the mechanism of intracellular trafficking utilized by the
nanoparticle. Drug stability can be achieved by avoiding
the entry of loaded nanoplatforms into lysosomes [143] or
by rapid endo-lysosomal escape [106, 107]. A recent study
demonstrated that silver nanoparticles were internalized by
human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) via a clathrindependent mechanism. Once inside the cells, stable
silver agglomerates could be observed in the perinuclear
region [144]. An additional report showed that ritonavir
nanoparticles coated with poloxamer 188 and assembled
by high-pressure homogenization were internalized by
human monocyte-derived macrophages through a clathrindependent mechanism. These nanoplatforms remained
387

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 378-396

stable inside endosomes and were then discharged by
Rab11 (Ras-related protein) and Rab14-dependent
mechanisms. The released nanoparticles kept their ability
to preclude HIV-1 infection in human monocyte-derived
macrophages [95].
Delayed drug release is also necessary to give the
cell carrier time to migrate towards the tumor. This can be
accomplished via “internal” and “external” triggers. Some
nanoparticles have been designed with a pH-sensitive
linker that releases drugs or peptides upon nanoparticle
entry into the lysosome [145]. Fang et al. developed a
nanoparticle system containing SPIO nanoparticles, a pHsensitive poly (beta-amino ester) (PBAE) copolymer, and
doxorubicin. This particle demonstrated drug release at pH
5.5 and 6.4 corresponding to the endosome [146]. Other
intrinsic release mechanisms include glutathione-mediated
controlled release where disulfide linkers are broken at
tumor-relevant glutathione levels [147]. However, for
stem cell delivery of such nanoparticles, it may be more
beneficial to have an external stimuli-mediated toxicity
to ensure that stem cell migration can be achieved. Some
external triggers that have been used to allow for release of
attached molecules from nanoparticles include ultrasound
release of drugs [148], photothermal linkers that break
in response to heat, and photo-mediated release [149].
In addition to this, other methods such as photothermal
ablation allow for control of a damaging stimulus to tumor
cells [150]. Although highly promising, the study of the
mechanisms behind drug stability and release from stem
cell carriers is still in its infancy. Additional efforts should
be invested to uncover new pathways and thus advance
this research field.

models may not fulfill expectations in humans.
Another fundamental point that needs to be
addressed when considering the use of stem cell
carriers in the clinical setting is the origin of these cells.
Heterologous stem cell carriers can be subject to HLA
mismatches and, consequently, host-related rejection [152,
153]. Cell carriers that are derived from the own patient
(autologous origin) are not subject to alloimmunization.
However, their isolation from human patients and
expansion in culture is so difficult, time-consuming, and
expensive that, unless alternative methods are developed,
the clinical implementation of this technique becomes
almost impossible [154, 155].

8.
CONCLUSION
PERSPECTIVES

FUTURE

The design of new nanoparticle systems for the
treatment of malignant gliomas has the objective of
developing both safer and more effective diagnostic
and therapeutic approaches. In order to fulfill their
full potential and serve as candidates for targeted drug
delivery, nanoparticles must present a versatile structure,
which should be amenable to small molecules, peptides,
and a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents. Their
construction should be biodegradable, non-toxic and
biocompatible, so they could deliver their therapeutic
payload anywhere in the brain without unwanted adverse
reactions due to nanoparticle accumulation or activation
of a host-related inflammatory response. They should also
present a controlled drug release profile, which would
secure continuous drug delivery at the targeted neoplastic
tissue. Upon reaching the malignant area, they should
first avoid the mononuclear phagocyte system and then
be effectively recognized and internalized by glioma
cells. This would allow for a direct and efficient payload
distribution.
Recent preclinical and clinical studies have
repeatedly underscored the importance of drug-loaded
nanoparticles in anti-cancer diagnosis and therapy.
Nevertheless, the use of drug-encapsulated nanomaterials
alone as a therapeutic tool still poses some important
limitations that hamper complete neoplastic destruction.
Two important examples are uneven intratumoral
distribution and inefficient targeting of disseminated tumor
areas. The combination of nanoparticle delivery systems
with stem cell carriers could potentially overcome these
limitations, increasing both the efficiency and efficacy
of nanotherapy. Due to their inherent tumor-tropic and
immunosuppressive properties, stem cells carriers can not
only serve as optimal vehicles for distant delivery, but can
also manipulate the tumor microenvironment in order to
assist in the eradication of tumor cells. Moreover, these
cell carriers can be loaded with multifunctional drugloaded radiolabeled nanomaterials. This combination
could be used as an extra instrument to report in vivo

7.5. Translational issues
An important pitfall regarding the implementation
of nanoparticle-loaded stem cell carriers into the clinical
setting for targeted anti-cancer therapy is the current
use of non-representative animal models in pre-clinical
studies. These models are not able to fully exemplify the
heterogeneous and complex nature of high-grade gliomas,
since rodent tumors grow much faster than human (weeks
vs years) and therefore they contain a much higher vascular
permeability. As more nanoparticle will extravasate leaky
vessels, the sole use of rapidly growing rodent models may
lead to an overestimation of the potential usefulness of
passively targeted drug-loaded nanoparticle systems [151].
Another critical point is that most preclinical studies are
performed in immunocompromised mouse models, which
exclude the possibility of evaluating the involvement of
the host-immune system on the therapeutic outcome. Last,
when compared to stem cell carriers transplanted to human
patients, preclinical rodent models are not representative
of the actual migration distance that these carriers need to
achieve in order to reach invasive tumor areas. Due to the
discrepancies between preclinical and clinical models, it
can be argued that many agents that are effective in animal

efficacy of the therapeutic agent and to track the fate of
stem cell carriers.
Although a promising strategy, the use of stem cell
carriers combined with drug-loaded nanoparticles for
anti-glioma therapy still faces some important challenges.
First, there should be a better characterization of molecular
targets that are specific to malignant gliomas, and are
not present in non-neoplastic tissues. As a consequence,
drug-loaded nanomaterials could be functionalized for a
highly targeted approach. Second, as nanoparticle-delivery
systems support a high drug loading per carrier, more
therapeutic agents are able to reach the targeted area. To
avoid unwanted toxicity, recalibration of drug dosage may
be necessary. Third, regarding the manufacturing process,
these nanovehicles should have their formulation design
optimized in order to increase their reproducibility, costeffectiveness and biocompatibility. This would open a new
path for redirecting nanomedicine formulations towards
industrial utilization and clinical translation. Last, more
efforts should be placed on a further characterization
of stem cell carriers and on the determination of their
biological function in the tumor microenvironment. This
would allow for a more reliable therapeutic exploitation of
these cell carriers.
More investments should be directed to the
development of multifunctional nanoplatforms, which
consist of both drugs and imaging agents within the
same nanoparticle delivery system. Such an approach
would allow for effective tracking of the destination
and biodistribution of cell carriers, nanoparticles and
therapeutic agents, permitting a non-invasive real-time
visualization of the efficacy of the intervention. This
information could actively influence the decision to adjust
drug dosage or to whether or not continue the therapy.
Image-guided insights would also assist in the prescreening of patients based on the profile of nanoparticle
assimilation by the tumor: active or passive targeting [156158]. Such knowledge might contribute to the development
of personalized medicine, where the best therapeutic
response for each patient would be predicted. Future
efforts should be directed towards better understanding the
biological and pathophysiological principles of stem cell
delivery to neoplastic areas, nanoparticle loading of stem
cells, biodistribution and assimilation of nanomedicines by
tumor cells, and drug targeting. It would allow us to obtain
a more in-depth understanding into the shortcomings of
stem cell-based tumor-targeted drug delivery, and would
assist us in finding optimal strategies to surpass these
limitations in the future.
