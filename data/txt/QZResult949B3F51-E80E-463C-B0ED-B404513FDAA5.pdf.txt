BACKGROUND: Although studies of melphalan-based isolated limb infusion (ILI) combine data from upper extremity (UE) treatments
with those from lower extremity (LE) treatments, differences between the 2 may be clinically important. METHODS: Candidates for
UE ILI (n ¼ 51) and LE ILI (n ¼ 192) were identified from prospective databases at 2 institutions. The Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors and Wieberdink toxicity scale were used as appropriate. RESULTS: The following patients had indications for UE ILI:
melanoma, 36 of 47 patients (77%); sarcoma, 5 of 47 patients (11%); Merkel cell sarcoma, 3 of 47 patients (6%), and squamous cell
carcinoma, 3 of 47 patients (6%). The patients who underwent UE ILI, as expected, had lower limb volumes (mean, 2.5 L vs 8.6 L; P <
.001) and lower mean melphalan doses (20.7 mg vs 49.5 mg; P < .001). On perfusate blood gas analysis, the mean base excess at 30
minutes (13.9 vs 9.1; P < .001) and the mean pH at 30 minutes (7.06 vs 7.15; P < .001) were lower for UE procedures than for LE
procedures, although the mean ischemic time was longer in LE procedures (67.2 minutes) than in UE procedures (61.6 minutes; P ¼
.03). The rate of regional toxicity grade 3 for UE ILI was 7% compared with 24% (P ¼ .005) for LE ILI. There was no difference in the
complete response rate for melanoma UE procedures (28%; 95% confidence interval, 16%-44%) compared with LE ILI procedures
(32%; 95% confidence interval, 25%-39%). CONCLUSIONS: ILI for UE disease was associated with similar complete response rates but
lower toxicity than ILI for LE disease and with different physiologic sequelae despite comparable methods. The UE appears relatively
resistant to toxic effects of melphalan-based ILI as currently performed, which suggests a potential for further optimization of drug

INTRODUCTION
Isolated limb infusion (ILI) is a well tolerated, minimally invasive technique for delivering high-dose regional chemotherapy. Although the procedure is used primarily as a modality to treat unresectable in-transit melanoma, other indications
include unresectable, limb-threatening extremity sarcoma and other tumor types that recur in a local, multifocal manner.
For advanced extremity melanoma, single-institution complete response (CR) rates after ILI with melphalan with or without dactinomycin range from 25% to 38% with a median durability of approximately 12 months.1-3 Differences in
treated patient populations, minor variations in performing the technique, and nonuniform response criteria account for
most of the variability among centers. A recent, retrospective, US multicenter study of ILI for melanoma reported a CR
rate of 29% (n ¼ 68) in patients who had a melphalan dose corrected for ideal body weight (IBW), a method of dosing
that reportedly decreases toxicity from ILI while not altering CR rates.4 For advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity,
the largest case series reported a CR rate of 57% and an overall limb salvage rate of 76% in 21 patients.5 Thus, ILI can
achieve durable CR rates that are higher than other forms of treatment for advanced extremity malignancies. The toxicity
profile of the procedure also is acceptable, with catastrophic toxicities (limb loss) nearly 10-fold less than such toxicities
that result from the maximally invasive counterpart to ILI, hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (HILP).6 Therefore, ILI
has become a popular first-line procedure of choice at many institutions for patients who present with advanced extremity
tumors that are not amenable to surgical resection.
In the 2 largest single-center case series of ILI for melanoma, upper extremity (UE) procedures accounted for only
7% (n ¼ 13) and 14% (n ¼ 21) of total procedures performed.3,6 In the case series of advanced extremity sarcoma, only 3

patients (14%) received treatment for UE disease. The
exact reason why UE in-transit disease appears to have a
lower incidence than LE in-transit disease is unclear but
cannot be explained fully by the larger surface area of the
LE. UE ILI may be more challenging from a technical
standpoint than LE ILI, because catheters typically are
placed percutaneously through the femoral artery and
vein and must be positioned near the elbow joint of the
affected UE. Thus, the catheter tips are much farther from
the access site compared with the LE (Fig. 1), and the caliber of vessels (brachial artery and vein compared with
femoral artery and vein) is much smaller in the UE; both
factors may contribute to lower flow rates achieved during
ILI of the UE. It is believed that maximizing the flow rate
during ILI is critical for optimal drug exposure.7
Despite the lower flow rates typically achieved with
UE in contrast to LE ILI, drug distribution may be better
achieved in smaller limb volumes as opposed to larger
limbs. In the multicenter US study of 75 ILI procedures,
patients who had an overall response to treatment (partial
responses [PRs] þ CRs) had significantly smaller limb
volume (6.45  2.1 L) than patients who did not respond
(8.01  347 L; P ¼ .021).4 This observation further suggests that drug distribution and delivery may be important
in determining response. In the largest case series of ILI
reported by the Sydney Melanoma Unit at Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital (Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia), a higher melphalan concentration in the isolated
circuit at the end of the procedure appeared to be significant for both CR (P ¼ .013) and overall response (P ¼
.022).3 Because drug delivery appears to have an impact

on response and drug delivery may vary between UE and
LE ILI procedures, we sought to review our experience of
UE and LE ILI procedures to determine whether any important differences in response rates or toxicity were
present.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Prospective databases from 2 centers were used to identify
51 patients who were candidates for UE ILI and 192
patients who were candidates for LE ILI from 2004 to
2011. Toxicity after all completed procedures (n ¼ 47)
was evaluated using the Wieberdink toxicity scale.7 Grade
3 toxicities included considerable edema and blistering,
whereas grade 4 toxicities were compartment syndromes.
Treatment response to ILI performed for melanoma only
(n ¼ 36) was evaluated according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 3 months after the
procedure. This study was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Duke University Medical
Center and Moffitt Cancer Center.
Intervention

ILI procedures were performed as previously described.1
Percutaneous arterial and venous catheters were placed by
vascular surgery or interventional radiology. The catheters
were inserted using the Seldinger technique in the ipsilateral (only for UE procedures) or contralateral (for UE or
LE procedures) femoral artery and vein; and, using fluoroscopic guidance, the tips were positioned near the
involved elbow or knee joint (Fig. 1). After the extremity
had been warmed to at least 37 C, chemotherapy was

wash-out. Circuit (perfusate) blood gases were taken at 25
minutes and 30 minutes after the initial infusion of chemotherapy to document the degree of hypoxia and acidosis.
The dose of melphalan was 10 mg/L for the UE and 7.5
mg/L for the LE at both centers (Duke University Medical
Center and Moffitt Cancer Center). The dose of dactinomycin was 100 lg/L for the UE and 75 lg/L for the LE at
Duke University Medical Center and 100 lg/L for the
UE and LE at Moffitt Cancer Center. Chemotherapy
doses were corrected for ideal body weight (IBW) based
on evidence that this dosing modification significantly
reduced grade 3 and 4 toxicities by 27% (P ¼ .027) without altering the CR rate.8,9 The melphalan concentration

Variables were compared using the Student t test, the
Fisher exact test, and r  c contingency tables, as appropriate. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of toxicity. Given our
effective sample size of 37 patients, the model included
only 2 covariates with a C statistic of 0.64. A 2-sided a
value of .05 was used for all tests. All statistical analyses
were performed using Enterprise Guide version 4.2 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The association of response
(CR vs all others) with overall survival was assessed with
the log-rank test, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used display the results of these tests.
RESULTS
In total, 51 UE and 192 LE planned procedures were analyzed from 2 centers. One planned UE procedure was
unable to be performed because of small vessel size. One
other UE procedure was aborted because of intimal flap
creation during catheter insertion, and 2 additional procedures were aborted because of difficulty obtaining
adequate flow. One LE procedure was aborted because of
inadequate flow. Thus, 47 UE procedures and 191 LE
procedures were available for analysis. Patient variables
for all procedures are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Age and
body mass index were similar between groups. The

majority of patients with UE tumors had melanoma (n ¼
36 of 47; 77%). The remaining patients had sarcoma (n
¼ 5), Merkel cell carcinoma (n ¼ 3), and squamous cell
carcinoma (n ¼ 3). LE procedures were performed for
similar indications (Table 2). Some patients (n ¼ 56)
were treated as part of clinical trials involving systemic
administration or ADH-1 (an N-cadherin antagonist) or
sorafenib in combination with melphalan by ILI. In particular, 4 patients who underwent UE ILI received systemic ADH-1; whereas 34 patients who underwent LE
ILI received systemic ADH-1, and 18 patients who underwent LE ILI received systemic sorafenib. Because it has
not been demonstrated that the administration of these
agents increases overall response rates to ILI with melphalan alone, these patients were included in the current
study.11,12 Finally, there was no significant difference in
the percentage of patients who had their melphalan doses
corrected for IBW between LE ILI procedures (89%) and
UE ILI procedures (83%).
Procedural variables are listed in Table 3. Peak temperatures were similar between groups (mean, 38.6 C for
UE vs 38.9 C for LE). The mean volume circulated during the 30-minute infusion, which was calculated only in
patients at Duke University Medical Center, was lower
for the UE group (1250 mL; n ¼ 11) than for the LE
group (1867 mL; n ¼ 73; P < .001). The mean ischemic
time was longer in the LE group (67.2 for LE vs 61.6 for
UE; P ¼ .03). The difference in ischemic time did not
reflect any planned procedural differences between the
UE and LE groups but may have been caused in part by
the more rapid achievement of mild hyperthermia (37 C)
in the UE group compared with the LE group. The mean
limb volume was significantly lower in the UE group (2.5
L) compared with the LE group (8.6 L; P < .001), resulting in a mean melphalan dose that was significantly lower
for the UE group (20.7 mg) compared with that for the

LE group (49.65 mg; P < .001). The melphalan dose was
volume-based, as discussed above (see Materials and
Methods), although the dose for UE ILI (10 mg/L) was
higher than that for LE ILI (7.5 mg/L). We examined the
peak plasma concentration of melphalan in a subset of
patients who underwent UE ILI (n ¼ 9) and LE ILI (n ¼
70) whose melphalan doses were corrected for IBW (Fig.
2, left). Although dosing was 10 mg/L for the UE group
and 7.5 mg/L for the LE group and was corrected for
IBW in all procedures in this subset, there was a wide
range of peak plasma concentrations (11.2-27.63 lg/mL
for UE and 14.8-40.06 lg/mL for LE). Because of the
small number of UE melphalan levels, a formal statistical
analysis was not performed comparing peak plasma concentration of melphalan in the UE group with that in the
LE group. However, there was a trend toward a higher
peak concentration in the LE group in this sample population. Next, we examined the correlations of response and
toxicity with plasma melphalan concentrations for UE
procedures only (Fig. 2, right). There appeared to be no
correlation between peak plasma concentration and either
clinical response or toxicity. The patient who had grade 3
toxicity in this subset of the UE group had received the
highest melphalan dose but did not have the highest peak
plasma concentration (Fig. 2, right).
It is noteworthy that there were differences in blood
perfusate gases that suggested a greater degree of acidosis
in the UE group versus the LE group during ILI (Table
3). The mean pH at 30 minutes was lower in the UE
group (7.06 vs 7.15; P < .001), and there was also a
greater mean base deficit at 30 minutes in the UE group
(13.9 mmol/L vs 9.1 mmol/L; P < .001). These differences were observed despite a mean ischemic time that
was 6 minutes longer in the LE group (67.2 minutes vs
61.6 minutes in the UE group; P ¼ .03). It is noteworthy
that the longer ischemic time was associated with a greater

degree of hypoxia in the LE group (mean oxygen partial
pressure [pO2] at 30 minutes, 7.9 mm Hg) than in the
UE group (mean pO2 at 30 minutes, 11.7 mm Hg; P ¼
.013). However, greater hypoxia in the LE group did not
lead to greater acidosis as measured by pH in the LE
group. In summary, patients in the UE group appeared to
become more acidotic but less hypoxic than the patients
in the LE group.
The rate of grade 3 Wieberdink toxicity for those
undergoing UE ILI for any indication was 6% (n ¼ 3 of
47), and no grade 4 toxicities were observed. For LE procedures, the rate of grade 3 toxicities was 24% (n ¼ 46 of
190), and 5% of patients (n ¼ 10) experienced grade 4 toxicity (excluding 1 LE patient whose toxicity assessment had
not been recorded). The percentage of patients with grade
3 toxicity was significantly higher for those undergoing
LE ILI (24% LE vs 6% UE; P ¼ .005). It was reported previously that the peak creatine kinase (CK) level is a strong
predictor of severe toxicity.13 In our study, the mean peak
CK was higher in patients who underwent LE ILI compared with those who underwent UE ILI (1673 U/L vs 918
U/L). The Student t test could not be used to compare UE
and LE groups, because the variances in CK were not similar between the groups. Therefore, we compared the 2
groups with respect to the proportion of patients who had a
CK level >1000 U/L, because, historically, 1000 U/L has
been the value at which concern for severe toxicity arises
and typically prompts the administration of high-dose steroid treatment.1,14 The proportion of patients who had
peak CK levels >1000 U/L after LE ILI (33%; 95% confidence interval, 27%-41%) was similar to the proportion af6140

ter UE ILI (19%; 95% confidence interval, 17%-42%).
Furthermore, even when controlling for the peak CK level,
UE procedures still produced fewer toxicities compared
with LE procedures (P ¼ .019). It is noteworthy that correcting the melphalan dose for IBW is associated with less
toxicity. However, the proportion of patients who had their
melphalan doses corrected for IBW was similar for both
groups (81% for UE, 88% for LE).
Next, we examined the clinical response rate for the
group of patients who underwent ILI for melanoma (n ¼
36). Four patients had received previous melphalan-based
regional therapies but were included in the response rates.
As outlined in Figure 3, 10 of 36 patients (28%) had a
CR, 9 of 36 patients (22%) had a PR, 5 of 36 patients
(14%) had stable disease (SD), 10 of 36 patients (28%)
had progressive disease (PD), and 2 of 36 patients (5%)
were lost to follow-up. By comparison, 173 patients
underwent LE ILI procedures for melanoma, and 167
were evaluable for response. Two patients underwent LE
ILI procedures for prophylactic indications, and 4
patients had not yet reached the 3-month time point and,
thus, were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining
167 patients, 53 of 157 patients (32%) who underwent
LE ILI had a CR, 35 of 157 patients (21%) had a PR, 18
of 156 patients (11%) had SD, 51 of 157 patients (31%)
had PD, and 10 of 167 patient s(6%) were lost to followup. A similar percentage of patients were lost to follow-up
in both groups. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in the CR rate between the UE and LE
groups (28% vs 32%, respectively; P ¼ .58). We also
examined overall survival for the patients who underwent

DISCUSSION
Optimizing drug delivery to tumor cells is essential to
maximizing response. It has been suggested that the relatively low flow system of ILI compared with HILP leads
to lower levels of melphalan uptake by tumor cells and,
subsequently, a lower response, although this finding has
not been examined thoroughly. Consequently, to maximize ILI flow rates, 1 center has described placing a
shorter venous catheter below the tourniquet on the ipsilateral side to improve blood flow and, thus, the total volume of blood circulated through the ILI circuit.7 Because
ILI procedures of the UE are associated with lower flow
rates, we sought to examine whether there were differences
in response or toxicity between UE ILI and LE ILI. Furthermore, most studies combine the results from both UE
and LE procedures without separate examination,
although the patients are dosed differently for melphalan.
In the current study, there were no differences in the
CR rate (28% UE vs 32% LE), but the frequency of grade

3 toxicities was significantly lower in UE procedures
(6% vs 24%).
Although the volume circulated over a 30-minute
period is lower for UE ILI, limb volumes are much smaller
in the arm, and the melphalan dose is higher for UE procedures (10 mg/L for UE vs 7.5 mg/L for LE). Peak
plasma concentrations actually appear to be higher in
patients undergoing LE ILI, although this finding was
limited by a small sample size. Ultimately, it is believed
that the concentration of drug in tumor tissue is the most
important factor in ILI, and this issue has been studied by
Thompson and colleagues using a microdialysis technique. Those authors observed a significant association
between tumor response and melphalan concentrations
measured over time in subcutaneous microdialysate (P <
.01).14 Enhanced uptake of melphalan into tumor cells
also may be enhanced by hypoxia and reduced pH, as suggested in animal models.3,13 In our current study, the differences in melphalan dose between the UE (10 mg/L)
and LE (7.5 mg/L) groups, the 6-minute difference in ischemic times, and the differences in physiologic sequelae
between UE and LE procedures did not lead to differences
in CR rates between UE and LE procedures. However,

UE procedures appear to be resistant to some of the toxic
effects of the procedure as currently performed despite
differences in physiologic sequelae. Although our study
was limited by a heterogenous and small group of
patients, the results suggest that further optimization of
drug dosing could enhance the efficacy of ILI for the treatment of UE tumors.
These results have important implications with
regard to the management of patients who have unresectable, in-transit extremity melanoma. ILI with melphalan
previously produced CR rates ranging from 25% to 38%
in single-center studies and 29% in a multicenter, retrospective study.1,2,4 In addition, having a clinical response
to regional therapy (including ILI) has been associated
with improved survival compared with the survival of
those who do not respond to therapy3,6 The results from
this study, in which we examined data from 2 large-volume ILI centers, include response rates for UE and LE
procedures that were similar to the rates reported previously and the finding that patients who attained a CR to
UE ILI had a significant survival benefit over those who
did not achieve a CR (Fig. 4). Despite a potential for less
effective drug delivery in the UE group, the CR rate was
are similar to that in the LE group, suggesting that UE ILI
for unresectable, in-transit melanoma is an important
therapeutic option for these patients.
Although the current study was focused on ILI, we
certainly advocate the role of HILP in the appropriate
patient and clinical setting. HILP may be particularly valuable in the setting of documented regional lymph node

disease or after ILI failure. However, ILI has an important
role in the management of advanced extremity neoplasms;
therefore, it is critical to identify strategies for improving
efficacy and minimizing toxicity to ILI. Such strategies
may include novel therapies. Although melphalan-based
regional therapies currently are used, we are conducting a
phase 1 trial of temozolomide using ILI. With the addition of new targeted agents, potential also exists to further
improve response rates with novel combination therapies
that may include regional therapy. We also are starting to
examine the tumor microenvironment using the hypoxia
marker EF5 (2-[2 nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl]-N-[2,2,3,3,3pentafluoropropyl]) before ILI to determine how hypoxia
and acidosis may affect treatment response. For example,
animal studies suggest that the magnitude and direction
of the pH gradient (intracellular pH and extracellular pH)
can be exploited for optimal intracellular drug delivery.15
Given the significant differences observed in the physiologic parameters in UE procedures versus LE procedures,
future studies will need to analyze UE ILI and LE ILI separately in an attempt to best optimize the therapeutic
potential of this form of regional treatment.
