A systematic review was performed to determine whether first-line dose-intensive
chemotherapy supported by growth factor or autologous bone marrow/stem cell
transplantation improves response rate, time-to-disease progression, or survival
compared with standard-dose chemotherapy in patients with inoperable, locally
advanced, or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
Cochrane Library databases were searched. Three randomized trials (2 phase 3, 1
phase 2), 12 phase 2, and 5 phase 1 dose-escalation trials were located. One randomized trial (N 5 314) did not detect significant differences in response rate
(P 5 .65) or survival (log-rank P 5 .98) between high-dose doxorubicin plus ifosfamide with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and doxorubicin

plus ifosfamide at standard doses. Progression-free survival, however, was significantly longer in the high-dose arm (log-rank P 5 .03). Higher rates of thrombocytopenia, infection, grade 3 of 4 asthenia, and stomatitis were observed with highdose compared with standard-dose chemotherapy. Preliminary results from a second randomized trial (N 5 162) indicated no benefit with respect to tumor
response for an intensified mesna, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), ifosfamide, and
dacarbazine regimen with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support compared with standard doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was significantly higher with the high-dose regimen. Four phase 2
trials of high-dose regimens observed tumor response rates greater than 50%.
Phase 1 trials reported dose-limiting toxicity for dose-intensive chemotherapy

lthough multidisciplinary management of early-stage localized
soft tissue sarcoma (STS) has led to several improved outcomes,
therapy of advanced (inoperable or metastatic) disease remains
problematic. In patients with metastatic STS who develop metastases the lung is the most common site, and in many patients may be
the only site, of distant dissemination.1 Although surgical resection

of pulmonary metastases may be curative in 15% to
30% of patients with isolated slow-growing metastases, the majority of patients with metastatic STS are
not candidates for such treatment.2,3 Patients with
metastatic involvement have a median survival of
approximately 1 year, and for most of these patients
systemic therapy is the only therapeutic option. The
cytotoxic agents doxorubicin and ifosfamide are
widely acknowledged to have the highest activity in
metastatic STS, with approximately 20% to 30% of
patients responding to these drugs as single agents.4–
7
Improved response rates have been observed with
combination chemotherapy involving doxorubicin
and ifosfamide at conventional doses8; however,
when data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs)
comparing single-agent doxorubicin to doxorubicinbased combination chemotherapy were pooled in a
recent meta-analysis, response and survival outcomes were not significantly different.4
More recent efforts to improve outcomes in
advanced STS have involved exploration of doseintensive chemotherapy regimens incorporating
growth factors and/or autologous stem cell support.
The rationale for this approach is premised on the
observation of a dose-response relation for both doxorubicin and ifosfamide as single agents in STS.8–12
Furthermore, several prospective trials have demonstrated that growth factors such as granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or
autologous bone marrow/stem cell transplantation,
may improve the hematologic tolerance of doseintense combination-chemotherapy regimens.13–15
As therapeutic options for adult patients with
advanced or metastatic STS are limited and the possibility of cure for these patients is virtually nonexistent, we chose to do a systematic review of the
available evidence on dose-intensive chemotherapy
for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic
STS and then develop a clinical practice guideline.16

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MEDLINE (1982 to June 2007), EMBASE (1980 to
June 2007), and the Cochrane Library (2007, Issue 2)
databases were searched. The disease-specific search
terms ‘‘sarcoma’’ (Medical subject heading [MeSH]),
‘‘soft tissue neoplasms’’ (MeSH), ‘‘*sarcoma/dt’’
(exploded MeSH term), and ‘‘soft tissue sarcoma’’
(text word) were combined with the treatment-specific terms ‘‘drug therapy’’ (MeSH), ‘‘drug therapy,
combined’’ (MeSH), ‘‘granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor’’ (MeSH), ‘‘granulocyte colonystimulating factor’’ (MeSH), ‘‘bone marrow trans-

plantation’’ (MeSH), ‘‘transplantation, autologous’’
(MeSH), ‘‘hematopoietic stem cell transplantation’’
(MeSH), and each of the following phrases used as
text words: ‘‘chemotherapy,’’ ‘‘high-dose,’’ ‘‘doseintense,’’ ‘‘g-csf,’’ ‘‘gm-csf,’’ ‘‘growth factor,’’ ‘‘abmt,’’
‘‘pbsc,’’ ‘‘psct,’’ and ‘‘transplant.’’
In addition, the 1998–2007 American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference proceedings
were searched for abstracts of relevant trials. The
Canadian Medical Association Infobase (http://
mdm.ca/cpgsnew/cpgs/index.asp) and the National
Guidelines Clearinghouse (http://www.guideline.gov/
index.asp) were also searched for existing evidencebased practice guidelines. Relevant articles and
abstracts were selected and reviewed by 2 reviewers,
and the reference lists from these sources were
searched for additional trials, as were the reference
lists from relevant review articles.
Studies (full reports or abstracts) were eligible for
inclusion if they included patients with advanced or
metastatic STS entered into RCTs comparing doseintensive chemotherapy regimens, supported by
growth factor (eg, G-CSF, GM-CSF) or autologous
bone marrow/stem transplantation, with a lower or
standard-dose chemotherapy regimen as first-line
therapy. Outcomes for all groups had to include
overall survival, time-to-progression, or tumor
response rate. ‘‘Dose-intensive chemotherapy’’ was
defined as a regimen for which the investigators
expressed intent to increase standard doses of
chemotherapy supported by the use of hematopoietic growth factors and/or autologous bone
marrow/stem cell transplant support. Comparator
regimens were accepted as standard chemotherapy
if they had been previously evaluated in a large
phase 2 trial or a randomized phase 3 trial without
growth-factor support.
Single-arm noncomparative trials were also
included if they were phase 2 trials that reported toxicity data, response rates, or survival rates, or if they
were phase 1 trials that reported dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for
adult patients who received dose-intensive chemotherapy (as defined above) as first-line therapy for
locally advanced or metastatic STS. The rationale for
including the noncomparative trials was the paucity
of RCTs and to permit as detailed a description as
possible of the potential efficacy and toxicity of
dose-intensive chemotherapy in STS.
Articles were excluded from the systematic
review if they included patients with pediatric sarcomas, bone sarcoma, or small round cell sarcomas
including Ewing sarcoma or if they assessed dose-intensive chemotherapy in the second-line setting.

RESULTS
A total of 20 reports evaluating dose-intensive chemotherapy and meeting the inclusion criteria defined
above were identified in the literature search (Table 1).
These included 2 phase 3 randomized trials,17,18
13 phase 2 trials (2 abstracts and 9 completed
trials),13,19–30 and 5 phase 1 dose-escalation trials.31–35
All but 2 trials28,29 administered chemotherapy that
included both an anthracycline (doxorubicin, epirubicin, or liposomal daunorubicin) and ifosfamide.
Seventeen trials13,17–23,25–27,29–32,34,35 used hematopoietic growth factors alone, and 3 trials used G-CSF
plus peripheral-blood stem cell rescue.24,28,33 Consideration was given to pooling data from the RCTs, but
the conclusion was that a meta-analysis would be
inappropriate as the 2 RCTs identified evaluated different chemotherapy regimens.

Randomized Trials
Two randomized trials compared standard to higher
doses of chemotherapy.17,18 Both trials incorporated
a colony-stimulating factor into the high-dose treatment regimen. A detailed discussion of these studies
is hindered by the finding that 1 of the trials was
reported in abstract form only.18
Patients who had received prior chemotherapy
were excluded from both trials. Neither trial was
double-blind, and no published information is available on concealment of allocation before randomization. The published report of a trial by Le Cesne
et al.17 included a justification of sample size and the
sample size was achieved. Data on survival, tumor
response, and disease progression are summarized in
Table 2. No quality-of-life data have been published
for these trials. Toxicity data are described later in
this report.
In the trial conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC),
Le Cesne et al.17 randomized 314 patients to receive
either a standard dose of doxorubicin and ifosfamide

or a high dose of doxorubicin combined with a
standard dose of ifosfamide. The patients randomized to the high-dose regimen received GM-CSF.
Six percent of randomized patients were excluded
from analysis because they did not meet the eligibility criteria for the trial. There were no significant differences between treatments for response rate
(P 5 .65) or survival (log-rank P 5 .98). Progressionfree survival, however, was significantly longer in the
high-dose arm (log-rank P 5 .03); 1-year progressionfree survival rates were 20% with standard chemotherapy and 28% with high-dose chemotherapy.
In the Bui et al.18 study, patients were randomized to receive either standard-dose MAID (mesna,
doxorubicin [Adriamycin], ifosfamide, and dacarbazine) or MAID 1 25% with G-CSF support. Preliminary results of this study, reported thus far only in
abstract form, suggested no benefit for the intensified regimen in terms of tumor response. Survival
data have not yet been reported.

Phase 2 Trials
Thirteen phase 2 trials13,19–30 investigated dose-intensive chemotherapy in patients with STS (Table 2).
The abstract by Patel et al.19 reported on a group of
79 patients who participated in 1 of 3 sequential
trials. This report included a smaller proportion of
patients with metastatic disease (53%), as opposed to
primary sarcoma.

In 7 of the 11 single-arm phase 2 trials, summarized in Table 3, ifosfamide and an anthracycline were
administered in combinations in which 1 or both
drugs were given at higher than standard doses with
G-CSF or GM-CSF.13,19,21,24–27 Four trials used doxorubicin (75–90 mg/m2 per cycle),13,19,21,24 2 used
epirubicin (90–110 mg/m2 per cycle),26,27 1 used liposomal daunorubicin (100 mg/m2 per cycle),25 and 1
phase 2 dose-escalation trial examined etoposide
and ifosfamide (600 mg/m2 and 4.5 g/m2, respectively, with a 10% increase in dose per course).28
Response rates ranged from 31% to 63% in 9 trials of
an anthracycline combined with ifosfamide at doses
>7.5 g/m2/cycle and median survivals ranging from
13 months to 24 months.19,21,23–27
Patel et al.19 included a subset of patients with
primary STS of extremity origin in whom the objective response rate was 80%; 52% of patients with
metastatic disease responded. Steward et al.13 used a
similar regimen to the high-dose arm in the randomized trial by Le Cesne et al.17 described above but
observed a higher response rate than that seen in the
RCT. In the phase 2 dose-escalation trial reported by
Saeter et al.,28 no significant correlation was found
between tumor response and mean dose level
(Spearman coefficient 0.129, P 5 .24). The Buesa
et al.29 trial differed from the other phase 2 trials in 2
ways. That study investigated dose-intensive singleagent ifosfamide, and GM-CSF was administered

only to patients who experienced 1 episode of
neutropenic fever or had no hematologic recovery
by Day 28. Sixty percent of patients received
GM-CSF.
One randomized phase 2 trial reported by Worden et al.22 was identified in addition to the singlearm studies summarized in Table 3. Of the 86
patients enrolled, 82 were randomized and 79 were
evaluated in this study comparing standard-dose
ifosfamide (6 g/m2) or high-dose ifosfamide (12 g/
m2), both given in combination with doxorubicin
(60 mg/m2) and G-CSF. Patients were stratified
for localized (n 5 52) versus metastatic disease
(N 5 27) before randomization. Two- and 3-year
overall survival rates were higher for the standarddose arm than for the high-dose arm (73% vs 57%
and 52% vs 49%, respectively). Statistical significance was not reached in these differences (relative
hazard ratio [HR] of death for the high-dose arm
compared with the standard-dose arm, 1.39; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 2.77; P 5 .34). Oneyear disease-free survival was 55% for the high-dose
arm and 52% for the standard-dose arm (HR 1.08;
95% CI, 0.56 to 2.09; P 5 .81). Among 27 patients
with metastatic disease, the 2-year overall survival
was 46% for both the high-dose and standard-dose
arms (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.44 to 3.14). However, the
1-year disease-free survival rate for this group of
patients was higher for the high-dose arm (29%)
than for the standard-dose arm (15%). Among 52
patients with localized disease, the 2-year overall
survival was 64% for the high-dose arm and 88% for
the standard-dose arm (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.62 to
4.31). One-year disease-free survival was 65% for
the high-dose arm and 75% for the standard-dose
arm.

Dose Escalation (Phase 1) Trials
Five phase 1 trials of dose-intensive chemotherapy
with ifosfamide and an anthracycline are summarized in Table 4.31–35 These studies were designed to
determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of
epirubicin given with a fixed dose of ifosfamide,31
ifosfamide given as a continuous infusion with a
fixed dose of an anthracycline,32–34 or increasing
doses for the MAID regimen.35 MTD was the dose at
which a substantial number of patients suffered
dose-limiting toxicity. At the MTD, dose reductions
were required because of serious hematologic toxicity, mucositis, neutropenic fever, vomiting and fatigue, and nephrotoxicity, which were observed in all
the trials.31–35 Although not a primary study objective, tumor response was also reported.

observed a higher rate of thrombocytopenia with
high-dose chemotherapy compared with standard
dose. Patients receiving the high-dose regimen
experienced an increased number of infections compared with those receiving standard-dose chemotherapy (16.6% vs 4.6%; P 5 .0004). There were 2 toxicityrelated deaths in the high-dose arm, 1 due to kidney
failure and 1 septic shock, and 1 death due to septic
shock in the standard-dose arm. The incidence of
grade 3 of 4 asthenia was significantly higher in the
high-dose arm (16% vs 4.5%; P 5 .0005), as was grade
3 of 4 stomatitis (13% vs 4%; P 5 .008).
Important differences between regimens in the
incidence of adverse events were observed in the Bui
et al.18 randomized trial. There were 5 toxicity-related
deaths in the MAID 1 25% arm, but causes of death
were not reported in the abstract. The rate of grade 4
thrombocytopenia was significantly higher with

intensified MAID compared with standard-dose
MAID (P 5 .0001). The incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher with MAID 1 25%; however, the difference was not statistically significant (66% vs 54%
with standard-dose MAID).
Similar adverse events were experienced in the
phase 2 trials. As might be expected, hematologic
toxicity including thrombocytopenia and neutropenia
was commonly observed across all trials (Note: Steward et al.13 and Patel et al.19 did not report on hematologic toxicity). Despite these toxicities, only 10
treatment-related deaths among 605 participants
were reported.13,19,29,30

DISCUSSION
To date, in patients with metastatic or unresectable
STS only 2 RCTs have been conducted to determine
whether dose-intensive chemotherapy with growth
factor support or autologous bone marrow/stem cell
support improves survival, response, or time-toprogression compared with standard-dose chemo-

therapy in the first-line treatment setting. Only 1
RCT, composed of 314 patients, reported data on all
3 outcomes; however, no significant differences in
overall survival or response rate were observed
between the 2 treatment groups.17 One-year progression-free survival was significantly longer in the
high-dose chemotherapy arm compared with the
standard-dose chemotherapy arm (28% vs 20%,
respectively; log-rank P 5 .03). The second RCT, by
Bui et al.,18 has only been published in abstract
form. In that study no benefit in response rate was
observed, and overall survival was not reported. One
randomized phase 2 trial reported by Worden et al.22
examined the role of high-dose ifosfamide specifically. In that trial no statistically significant improvements in overall or disease-free survival were
observed between the high- and standard-dose
chemotherapy arms. Although several small phase 2
trials have reported response rates of 31% to 63%
with overall median survival ranging from 13 to
24 months, it is clear that this experience was not
replicated in the RCTs.
Although none of the trials evaluated potentially
myeloablative regimens similar to those used in
other settings such as hematologic malignancies, it is
quite clear that even modest dose escalations beyond
standard-dose chemotherapy are associated with
increased hematologic toxicity. Treatment-related
deaths were more common in the high-dose arms
(7 deaths) than in the standard-dose arms (1 death)
in both phase 3 trials.

Conclusions
Although 1 of the randomized trials reported that 1year progression-free survival was significantly longer
in the high-dose chemotherapy arm, this systematic
review has been unable to discern any consistent
benefits in patients with metastatic unresectable STS
when doses higher than standard-dose chemotherapy are used in this setting. Future research in
patients with inoperable, locally advanced, or metastatic STS should focus on the identification of novel
compounds or combinations that improve the
response rate or survival of these patients. If highdose chemotherapy with growth factor support or
autologous bone marrow/stem cell transplantation is
to be pursued, potentially myeloablative combinations similar to those used in hematologic malignancies should be compared with conventional
approaches. Outcomes should include survival,
response, response duration, symptom control, and
quality of life.
