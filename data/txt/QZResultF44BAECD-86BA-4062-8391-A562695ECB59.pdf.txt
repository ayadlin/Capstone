ABSTRACT
Virus-neutralizing antibody and B cell responses to influenza A viruses were
measured in 35 aged and 28 middle-aged individuals following vaccination with the
2012 and 2013 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines. Antibody responses to the
vaccine strains were lower in the aged. An analysis of B cell subsets by flow cytometry
with stains for immunoregulators showed that B cells of multiple subsets from the
aged as compared to younger human subjects showed differences in the expression of
the co-inhibitor B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). Expression of BTLA inversely
correlated with age and appears to be linked to shiftsing the nature of the response
from IgM to IgG. High BTLA expression on mature B cells was linked to higher IgG
responses to the H1N1 virus. Finally, high BTLA expression on isotype switched
memory B cells was linked to better preservation of virus neutralizing antibody titers
and improved recall responses to vaccination given the following year.

INTRODUCTION

for induction of long-lived affinity-matured plasma and
memory B cells, is decreased in the aged [5]. Some of
the defects of B cell responses in the elderly are also
caused by an age-related decline of helper functions from
CD4+ T cells [6]. This phenomenon is marked by reduced
expression of critical costimulatory receptors, such as
CD28 and CD40 ligand, which in turn, are essential for
activation of B cells and germinal center formation [7].
Additionally, similar to observations made in T cells,
expression of coinhibitory receptors such as programmed
death (PD)-1 or lymphocytes activation gene (LAG)3 may increase upon aging, tipping the balance toward
inhibition of immune responses [8].
To further define age-related defects in responses to
the 2012/2013 TIV, we tested virus neutralizing antibody
(VNA) and B cell responses in a cohort of 35 aged
individuals of or above 65 years of age in comparison to
28 younger individuals between 30-40 years of age. VNA
responses were tested against the two influenza A virus
strains of the vaccine, i.e., H1N1 A/California/7/2009

In the 2012/13 Influenza season, infections with
H3N2 virus were predominant. Final analyses of vaccine
efficacy in the US and Canada reported an efficacy of ~
32% for influenza A viruses in the general population.
However, in people over 65 years of age, the efficacy
against influenza A viruses only reached 9% [1]. Overall,
vaccine-induced protection against the most prevailing
Influenza A virus was far from optimal in spite of a good
match between the vaccine and the circulating strains.
Poor vaccine efficacy in the elderly is of particular concern
since the elderly experience increased morbidity and
mortality following infection [2]. Primary B cell responses
in the elderly are commonly low and short-lived, resulting
in antibodies with low affinity [3]. The elderly are also
prone to develop recall responses that match previously
circulating strains, a phenomenon known as antigenic sin
caused by prior recurrent influenza virus infections [4].
In addition, germinal center formation, which is required

Immune responses were tested from blood at baseline and
on days 7 and 14 after TIV. We had conducted a study
for individuals vaccinated with the 2011/2012 TIV and
shown that circulating B cell responses peak at these time
points [9]. Cellular responses were analyzed with regard
to numbers of circulating cells of different B cell subsets,
i.e., transitional B cells, mature naïve B cells, unswitched
and switched memory B cells, double-negative B cells,
and antibody secreting cells (ASCs) defined by stains
for CD19, IgD, CD20, CD27, and CD38. In addition,
we characterized expression of the B and T lymphocyte
attenuator (BTLA), which upon interactions with the
herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) provides inhibitory
signals [10].
Our results show that, as expected, the younger
individuals mounted higher VNA responses to both viruses
and had higher numbers of naive B cells compared to the
aged. BTLA was significantly higher expressed on B cells
from younger compared to aged individuals at baseline.
Expression levels of BTLA, as well as percentages of
BTLAhi B cells, selectively increased in the aged after
vaccination so that differences between the two cohorts
cease to be significant. Individuals with high BTLA on
their mature B cells had better IgG responses to the H1N1
virus, compared to those with low BTLA. Further analysis
showed that individuals with high BTLA expression
levels showed better preservation of H1N1- and H3N2specific VNA titers and superior booster response to the
next annual dose of TIV compared to those with BTLAlo
switched memory B cells. Overall these results show
that a decline of BTLA during immunosenescence may
contribute to lack of sustained antibody responses in the
aged and to a reduction in their ability to mount recall
responses.

to influenza. Some of these individuals were re-vaccinated
the following year with the 2012/13 TIV.

VNA responses to the influenza A virus strains of
2012/13 TIV
At baseline before vaccination with the 2011/12
TIV, VNA titers to H1N1 California//7/2009 (from here
on referred to as H1N1) were higher in the younger
individuals (p = 0.0025 by Wilcoxon Rank analysis);
titers to H3N2 Victoria/361/2011 (from here on referred
to H3N2) were comparable (Figure 1). After vaccination,
both cohorts developed increased VNA titers to H1N1 and
H3N2. VNA responses to H1N1 tested at baseline or on
days 7 and 14 after vaccination were significantly higher
in younger individuals (Figure 1A). Responses to H3N2
virus were also higher in the younger cohort, although this
only reached significance for day 7 (Figure 1B).

Changes in circulating B cells
Numbers of cells belonging to different B cell
subsets were tested for by flow cytometry upon staining
of PBMCs with antibodies to lineage defining markers
(Figure 2). Numbers of naïve B cells (CD19+IgD+) in
blood were at all three time points higher in the younger
individuals (p < 0.0001). There was a trend towards
increased numbers of transitional B cells, which form a
link between immature B cells in bone marrow and mature
naïve B cells in the periphery in younger individuals;
this failed to reach significance. The same was seen for
double-negative IgD-CD27- B cells, which may reflect
exhausted B cells that have previously been described to
be more common in the aged [11], as well as for switched
memory B cells. Numbers of cells within the individual
subsets were primarily stable over time, but ASCs in both
age groups individuals showed a non-significant trend
towards increases on day 7 as compared to baseline.

Age-related differences in BTLA expression on B
cells

To compare immune responses of aged and
younger individuals to the two influenza A virus strains of
2012/2013 TIV, a total of 35 aged individuals of or above
65 years of age and 28 younger individuals between 3040 years of age were enrolled in the Durham-RaleighChapel Hill of North Carolina. Briefly, the aged were
on average 76 years of age ranging from 66 to 88 years
of age, with 64% females and 95% Caucasians. Most
individuals but for 4 had been vaccinated in 2011, the
majority (58%) reported annual vaccinations with TIV.
Younger individuals were on average 35 years of age with
64% females, 75% Caucasians, 21% African Americans
and 4% Asians. All but two individuals received the
2011/12 Flu vaccine and 43% reported annual vaccination

It has been shown previously for T cells that the
expression of co-inhibitors changes upon aging [8].
We tested B cells for a number of different markers at
baseline and upon vaccination, BTLA was found to show
significant age-related differences (Figure 3). At baseline,
BTLA expression and percentages of BTLAhi cells were
significantly higher for B cells of all subsets from younger
than aged individuals. After vaccination, expression levels
slightly increased on aged B cells while percentages of
BTLAhi cells increased significantly in the aged for several
of the B cell subsets. By day 7, differences between
aged and younger B cells were only significant for non19446

switched memory B cells, switched memory B cells and
double-negative B cells. By day 14 after vaccination, both
levels of BTLA expression and percentages of BTLAhi
cells became comparable for all B cell subsets between
the two age groups. BTLA expression at baseline showed

a strong negative correlation with the biological age of
the individuals on all B cell subsets again supporting that
expression of the co-inhibitor declines upon aging (Figure
4A).

BTLA expression on mature B cells indicates
higher increases in antibody titers

while TFH cells were BTLAlo. Results from this new cohort
again confirmed higher BTLA expression on B cells from
younger individuals. This was also seen for TFH cells.
HVEM was expressed at approximately equal levels on
TFH cells between the younger and the aged individuals,
while B cells from younger individual expressed slightly
higher levels.

To see if BTLA expression was related to antibody
production, we looked at antibody titers of individuals
with either high or low levels of BTLA on their mature
B cells, irrespective of age. We selected ten individuals
who had either the highest (BTLA high) or lowest (BTLA
low) expression on their mature B cells, at baseline/on
the day of vaccination, and looked at their virus specific
antibody titers by ELISA, at baseline and two weeks after
vaccination. Individuals with high BTLA on their mature
B cells, showed the highest increase in IgG antibodies to
the H1N1 virus, compared to those with low BTLA on
their mature B cells (Figure 4B). This trend was reversed
for IgM titers, indicating a possible role for BTLA in class
switching of antibody responses.

High BTLA expression on memory B cells
influences VNA responses
Many of the individuals that we vaccinated in the
2012/13 season were vaccinated again by our team in the
2013/14 season. This gave us the opportunity to follow
the evolution of antibody titers after an additional boost.
To assess if levels of BTLA expression influenced VNA
responses to the two influenza A virus strains of the
vaccine we selected 10 individuals (regardless of age) that
at baseline in 2012 had the highest (4 aged, 6 younger) or
lowest (9 aged, 1 younger) levels of BTLA expression on
their switched memory B cells. We analyzed their VNA
titers on days 0, 7 and 14 after vaccination with 2012/13
TIV and then again 1 year later on day 0, 7 and 28 with
2013/14 TIV. Increases in VNA titers to the influenza A
virus strains of TIV in 2012 were similar in individuals
with BTLAhi or BTLAlo switched memory B cells
although there was an insignificant trend towards higher
responses of the former to H3N2 virus. More impressive
was that individuals with BTLAhi switched memory B
cells maintained higher titers of H1N1 and H3N2-specific
VNAs for the one year period between their seasonal Flu
shots (compare d0 levels in 2013) and in addition mounted
more robust recall responses in the following season
compared to those that had BTLAlo switched memory B
cells at baseline in 2012 (Figure 6).

B cells express higher levels of BTLA than
follicular T helper cells
To formally test if BTLA signaling affects induction
of ASCs, we tested if HVEM, the binding partner of
BTLA, is expressed on follicular T helper (TFH) cells. TFH
cells interact with B cells during their differentiations
into ASCs in lymph node follicles through interactions
between PD-1 and PD-L2 [12] or ICOS and ICOS-ligand
[13] expressed on TFH and B cells respectively. TFH cells,
which generally reside in lymph nodes, can be detected
at low frequencies in blood [14], were identified by
positive staining for CD4, CXCR5 and PD-1. B cells were
identified by staining for CD19. A stain for BTLA was
included in the experiment, which used PBMC samples
from 13 aged and 6 younger individuals that were not part
of the original cohort shown in Figures 1-4. As shown in
Figure 5, BTLA was expressed at high levels on B cells

DISCUSSION

vaccines. Antibody responses were analyzed to identify
non-responders by neutralization assays. As expected,
antibody responses of the aged tended to be lower than
those of younger individuals.
Our main emphasis was to identify differences in B
cell subsets at baseline and upon immunization between
aged and younger individuals and to assess if and how
the differences may explain low responsiveness of the
aged. Confirming previous results, numbers of circulating
naïve B cells were lower in the aged [25] while numbers
of some of the other subsets only showed a trend towards
an age-related decline. Our main finding was that on all B
cell subsets expression of BTLA prior to vaccination was
significantly lower in the aged.
HVEM, the binding partner of BTLA also binds
CD160, LIGHT, and lymphotoxin A [26]. BTLA and
CD160 bind to overlapping sites while LIGHT and
lymphotoxin B bind to a different domain. CD160
and BTLA provide inhibitory signals while LIGHT
and lymphotoxin A act as co-stimulators. In case of
simultaneous binding of an inhibitor and an activator,
negative signaling prevails. The BTLA signaling pathway
has mainly been studied for T cell responses where its
blockade was shown to increase T cell responses to
vaccines [27] and resistance to infections [28]. Negative
signaling through BTLA seems to be conserved in CD8+
T cells of aged mice as gD-mediated blockade markedly
improves their response to vaccination [29]. Downstream
events of BTLA, a member of the CD28 family, remain
controversial. The cytoplasmic tail of BTLA similar to
that of the well characterized PD-1 immunoregulator
carries a membrane proximal immunoreceptor tyrosinebased inhibition motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM).
These motifs, through recruitment of the Src homology
(SH) proteins (SHP)-1, and SHP -2, could inhibit the

Influenza vaccination is highly recommended for
the elderly although vaccine efficacy tends to be less
than optimal in this age group. Numerous studies have
addressed the effect of immunosenescence on innate
and adaptive immune responses in animals as well as
humans [5-8, 15-23]. Human immune responses to
influenza virus antigens are unique and cannot readily be
recapitulated in animal models as humans are repeatedly
exposed to antigens of influenza virus through infections
or vaccinations. In adults, influenza vaccines elicit
both recall responses to epitopes that are shared with
previously encountered viruses and primary responses
from naïve B and T cells to novel drifted epitopes or
shifted antigens. Recall responses are expected to be
particularly predominant in the elderly with their more
numerous exposures to influenza viruses or vaccines,
resulting in responses that can be poorly fitted to the
recall antigen [4]. It has been previously shown for T
cells that immunosenescence selectively affects primary
responses, while memory responses elicited before aging
do not become impaired [23]. This suggests that immune
responses to conserved influenza antigens might remain
intact even in the aged. As has also been shown for T cells,
repeated recall of immune responses not only increases
the pool of memory cells but also changes their activation
status [24], which again may disproportionally affect
the aged with their enhanced memory to influenza virus
antigens.
We undertook this study with cohorts of aged and
middle-aged individuals to assess age-related defects in
antibody and B cell responses to TIV. A cohort of middleaged individuals was chosen for comparison to the elderly
with the expectation that these subjects had previous
although less numerous exposures to influenza viruses or

activating effects of CD3/CD28 ligation leading to
reduced production of cytokines and cell proliferation
[30]. In addition BTLA, like CD28, contains a sequence
in its cytoplasmic domain that may interact with the Grb2 adaptor protein. This sequence could also enable it to
interact either directly or indirectly with the p85 subunit
of PI3 kinase, which in turn could provide survival
signals [31]. Although BTLA is generally viewed as a
co-inhibitor, one report showed that this may depend on
the strength of antigenic stimulation; specifically, in the
setting of weak stimulation by alloantigens, BTLA was
found to be inhibitory while upon potent alloantigen
stimulation BTLA appeared to promote the T cell response
[31]. Other data showed that lack of BTLA reduced
rather than augmented pathology in a colitis model [32]
and promoted survival of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells
induced by bacterial infection [33] again suggesting that
BTLA may have disparate role in maintaining homeostasis
of the immune system.
One interesting observation was the relationship
between BTLA expression on mature B cells prior to
vaccination, and increases in H1N1 specific IgG antibody
titers with concomitant decreases in IgM titers. This
seems to indicate that high BTLA expression on mature
B cells might play a role in augmenting IgG production,
specifically in shifting the response from IgM to IgG. The
fact that we only saw this for the H1N1 virus, and not the
H3N2 virus needs to be noted. It may reflect that H1N1
underwent a dramatic change in 2009 and is thus a fairly
recent virus while variants of H3N2 have been circulating
since 1968.
More intriguing was that high expression of
BTLA on switched memory B cells, the main subset that
responds to vaccination against influenza virus to which
adult humans in general have immunological memory
was linked to better preservation of VNA responses to
the two influenza A virus strains of TIV and to higher
recall responses upon the next dose of TIV given one
year later. This in turn suggests that BTLA may promote
rather than suppress the induction of long-lived plasma
cells and memory B cells, a hypothesis that remains to be
investigated further.
In summary our results show a decline in BTLA
expression on B cells upon immunosenescence that may
be linked to decreased induction of long-lived plasma
cells, memory B cells, and antibody titers in the aged.

virus were obtained from the Center for Disease Control,
Atlanta, Georgia. Viruses were expanded by injecting 100
µl of 4 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of virus/ml into 10
day-old specific pathogen-free embryonated eggs, which
were then incubated for 48 hrs at 35°C. After 48 hrs, the
eggs were chilled at 4°C overnight. The allantoic fluids
from the infected eggs were harvested and concentrated
by centrifuging at 20,000rpm for 1 hr at 4°C. The
concentrated viral pellet was resuspended in PBS and
further purified by fractionation over 10-55% sucrose
density gradients at 25,000rpm for 2 hrs. Purified viruses
were serially diluted on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney
(MDCK) cells to determine mean tissue culture infective
dose (TCID50) after 3 days of infection by screening for
cytopathic effects (CPE).

Human subjects
Blood was collected after informed consent from
community dwelling persons in the Durham-RaleighChapel Hill area of North Carolina. Younger individuals
were 30-40 years of age; older individuals were > 65
years of age. The following subjects were excluded
from the study: (1) humans with immunosuppression
resulting from diseases (e.g., clinically active malignancy,
HIV/AIDS, immune disorders) or drugs (e.g., cancer
chemotherapy, corticosteroid use); (2) individuals with
significant underlying diseases that would be expected to
prevent completion of the study; (3) subjects, which were
bed-ridden or homebound or had intercurrent illnesses that
might interfere with interpretation of study (e.g., urinary
tract infection, respiratory tract infection); (4) individuals
that were unlikely to adhere to protocol follow-up; (5)
subjects that were involved in a conflicting study; (6)
subjects that had a history of alcohol or substance abuse;
(7) subjects with contraindication for influenza vaccination
such as anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or to other
components of the influenza vaccine, and moderate or
severe acute illness with or without fever, and GuillainBarre Syndrome within 6 weeks following a previous
dose of influenza vaccine. Persons with moderate to
severe acute febrile illness were not vaccinated until their
symptoms had abated.
From enrolled subjects demographic data and
medical history including medical diagnoses, medications,
vaccination to influenza and other infectious diseases, and
history of influenza or influenza-like diseases during the
last 5 years were recorded. Subjects were bled and then
vaccinated with TIV via the intramuscular route in the
deltoid muscle. Subjects were bled again on days 7 and
14 following injection of TIV. Some of the subjects were
revaccinated with TIV the following years using the same
procedures.

Collection of blood and isolation of PBMCs and
plasma

The optimal concentrations of these antibodies were
determined experimentally. Samples were stained for 30
minutes at room temperature and washed with PBS. The
cells were then permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm
(BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 4°C, washed with
Permwash (BD Biosciences) and stained with their
specific panel of intracellular antibodies. The samples
were stained with the intracellular stains for 30 minutes at
4°C, washed with PBS and then resuspended in 150μl of
fixative (BD Pharmingen). All antibodies were obtained
from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA) unless specified
differently. The stained samples were analyzed in a LSRII
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Blood was collected into heparinized tubes and
shipped overnight to Philadelphia, PA. A 1.5 ml aliquot
of each sample was set aside for serum collection.
PBMCs were isolated from the remaining samples using
established protocols. Specifically, blood was overlaid
onto Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare Biosciences,
Piscataway Township, NJ) and spun for 30 minutes at
2000 rpm, with brake off, and at 50% acceleration. The
PBMC layer at the Ficoll interface was then collected
and washed twice with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY), by centrifuging at 2000
rpm. The washed, pelleted cells were treated with 10 ml
of red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience, San Diego,
CA). Lysis was stopped by adding 5 ml of Roswell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]. Cells were washed
with Hank’s Salt (HBSS). Cells were resuspended in 5ml
of Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM), live
cells were counted using Trypan Blue as a diluent.

ELISA
H1N1- and H3N2-specific binding antibody
isotypes were measured by ELISA. Briefly, wells of Nunc
Maxisorp™ plate were coated with 10μg/ml of influenza
H1N1 or H3N2 virus along with isotype standards for
IgA1, IgG and IgM (Athens Research & Technology, Inc.,
Georgia, USA) in bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4°C. The
plates were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and incubated
for 2 hrs at room temperature with heat-inactivated
sera of young and aged subjects at a dilution of 1/250.
The plates were washed 4X with PBS containing 0.05%
tween (PBST) and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature
with alkaline phosphatase conjugated mouse anti-human
IgA1 at 1:1000, IgG at 1:3000 and IgM at 1:1000
dilutions (SouthernBiotech, Alabama, USA). Following
the incubation, plates were washed 4X with PBST and
developed using alkaline phosphatase substrate containing
pNPP tablets (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri, USA) dissolved
in DEA buffer. Adsorbance was recorded at 405nm. The
adsorbance values were plotted against standard curves
from each plate for every isotype. Antibody concentrations
were determined and are expressed in μg/ml.

Micro-neutralization assay
Two-fold serially diluted (1:20 to 1:10240) heatinactivated human sera were tested for neutralizing
antibodies to influenza A virus strains by microneutralization assays. Equal volume of 100TCID50 per
well of the titrated virus was added to the diluted serum
in 96 well plates and incubated at 37°C. After 1hr, serumvirus mixtures were added to MDCK cells that had been
washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagles Medium (DMEM). The cells were incubated
for 2 hrs at 37°C with 5% CO2. The cells were washed
and re-incubated with DMEM supplemented with L
-1-Tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone
(TPCK) trypsin for 3 days. CPEs were scored under a
microscope. Neutralization titers were defined as the
dilution of the serum that resulted in 50% inhibition of
CPE formation.

Statistical analyses
Results were analyzed by multiple t-tests or 2-way
ANOVA. Correlations were tested for by Spearman.
P-values were corrected for multiple testing using
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Results with corrected
p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.

B cell detection by flow cytometry
Each subject sample was initially treated with
Human TruStain FcX Fc Receptor Blocking solution
(BioLegend, San Diego, CA) for 30 minutes, washed
with PBS at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and then stained
with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. Samples were
stained first for their extracellular markers using the
following antibodies: CD19-Brilliant VioletTM 650, CD20Brilliant VioletTM570, IgD-PeCy7, CD38-PerCPCy5.5,
CD3-Pacific Blue, CD14-Pacific Blue, CD27-FITC,
BTLA-APC, and AmCyan Aquablue as a live cell stain.
