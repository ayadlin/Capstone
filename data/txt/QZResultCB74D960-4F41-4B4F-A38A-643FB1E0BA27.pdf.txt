BACKGROUND: Complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is predominantly seen in
‘‘ERBB2’’ and ‘‘basal-like’’ tumors using expression profiling. We hypothesize that a similar response could be predicted using semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). METHODS: ER, PR, and HER2 were used to classify 359 tumors
treated with NACT into 6 groups: luminal A (strong ERþ, HER2 negative), luminal B (weak to moderate ERþ, HER2
negative), triple negative (negative for ER, PR, and HER2), ERBB2 (negative for ER and PR, but HER2þ), luminal AHER2 hybrid (strong ERþ and HER2þ), and luminal B-HER2 hybrid (weak to moderate ERþ and HER2þ). Complete
pathologic response was defined as absence of invasive carcinoma in the breast and regional lymph nodes. RESULTS:
Thirteen percent (48 of 359) demonstrated complete pathologic response. The highest rate of complete pathologic
response was seen in ERBB2 (33%; 19 of 57) and triple negative (30%; 24 of 79) tumor classes. Among the ERþ ‘‘molecular’’ group, the highest rate of complete pathologic response was seen among luminal B-HER2 hybrid tumors, 8%
(2 of 24). Remainder of ERþ tumors demonstrated a very low rate of complete pathologic response, 1.5% (3 of 198).
The 5-year survival for patients achieving complete pathologic response was 96% compared with 75% in patients
that failed to achieve complete pathologic response. The overall survival was worse in the ER-negative group (ERBB2
and triple negative) compared with the ER-positive group. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the recently defined ‘‘triple
negative paradox,’’ or rather ‘‘hormone receptor negative paradox,’’ that despite the best response to NACT, ERBB2
and triple negative tumors show the worst overall survival because of higher relapse among those with residual

KEYWORDS: immunohistochemical surrogate markers, breast cancer molecular classes, neoadjuvant chemotherapy,

Traditionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has been used in locally advanced breast cancers that are

deemed inoperable.1 More recently, it has been increasingly used for T2 and T3 tumors that are resectable, but the intent
is to reduce the tumor size by NACT and subsequently remove a smaller portion of breast tissue than would otherwise be
removed at primary surgery.2-4 NACT followed by excision provides a unique opportunity to objectively assess in vivo tumor response to chemotherapeutic drugs. This information can be used for future patient treatment for further consolidation in case of complete response or trigger alternative therapeutic regimen in cases of minimal or no response.
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease at the morphologic, immunohistochemical (IHC), and even molecular level.
Therefore, some breast carcinomas respond completely to NACT and others show minimal or no response.4,5 Apart from
the breast tumor itself, other factors that may predict response include the number of cycles and type of chemotherapy

the current chemotherapeutic protocols are rather limited
and use a very similar type of chemotherapy (anthracycline or taxane based) except for human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive patients who also
receive trastuzumab, and most patients receive 4-8 cycles
before surgical excision.7-9 The tumor tissue microenvironment and host response may also be important determinants of chemotherapeutic response but appears to be
tightly linked to tumor type itself.
On the basis of decades of morphologic data, it is
well-known that only a subset of ductal carcinomas shows
pathologic complete response to NACT. Recent gene
expression-based studies have shown complete pathologic

response in 45% of ERBB2 and basal-like breast carcinomas compared with only 6% in luminal subtype.10
The primary aim of this study was to analyze the
NACT database at our institution and identify the molecular classes (using IHC surrogate markers) that predict
complete pathologic response to NACT. The molecular
classes, tumor grade, and complete pathologic response
were correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The institutional review board approved the study. The
patient case list was obtained from the hospital tumor
registry, which represented consecutive cases treated with
NACT at our institution. However, some cases did not
meet the criteria for inclusion in the study as explained in
Table 1. Clinical information and pathology data was
carefully extracted from the clinical charts and reports to
include a total of 359 cases for this study (Table 1).
IHC Surrogate Markers of Molecular
Classification
Semiquantitative IHC results for hormone receptor and
HER2 were obtained from pathology reports to classify
tumors into molecular classes (Table 2). By using the criteria mentioned in Table 2, the tumors were classified as
luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2, triple negative, luminal AHER2 hybrid, and luminal B-HER2 hybrid. These criteria correspond to the initial gene expression profiling
studies and are similar (but not identical) to the prior
studies that used IHC as a surrogate for molecular classification.11-13 The criteria shown in Table 2 primarily

IHC Criteria and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy/Bhargava et al

correspond to Cheang et al’s criteria,14 but we have subdivided the luminal category into luminal A, luminal B,
luminal A-HER2 hybrid, and luminal B-HER2 hybrid
based on hormone receptor expression level and HER2
positivity. The subdivision was performed to study the
impact of semiquantitative hormone receptor analysis and
coexpression of hormone receptors and HER2 on chemotherapeutic tumor response and survival. At our institution, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor
(PR) results are reported using a semiquantitative score
(previously described as ‘‘H-score’’), which details the percentage of positive cells showing none, weak, moderate, or
strong staining.15,16 The score is given as the sum of the
percentage staining multiplied by an ordinal value corresponding to the intensity level (0 ¼ none, 1 ¼ weak, 2 ¼
moderate, 3 ¼ strong). With 4 intensity levels, the resulting score ranges from 0 (no staining in the tumor) to 300
(diffuse intense staining of the tumor). HER2 protein was
analyzed and scored using either HercepTest (1999-2003)
or CB11 antibody (2004-2006) and basic DAB detection
on Benchmark XT (Ventana, Tucson, Ariz). HER2 was
considered positive with either 3þ immunoreactivity (diffuse strong reactivity in >10% of the tumor cells) or
unequivocal amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (with a ratio of HER2 to chromosome 17
centromeric region >2.2, using PathVysion Vysis dualcolor FISH by Vysis Inc., Downers Grove, Ill). All 2þ cases
(by immunohistochemistry) included in this study were
followed by FISH. Equivocal FISH result (1.8: 2.2 ratio)
was considered as negative for HER2 in this study.
Morphologic Examination
A detailed morphologic examination of pretherapy core
biopsy specimen was performed on 191 cases. Slides from
the remaining 168 specimens were not available for
review. Several morphologic parameters were recorded as
follows: tumor type (ductal, lobular, other), tumor subtype, tubule formation score (1-3), nuclear pleomorphism
score (1-3), mitotic activity score (1-3), total score (3-9),
Nottingham grade (1-3), absolute mitoses count/10 highpower fields, tumor borders (infiltrative/pushing), sheetlike growth pattern, lobular-like growth, spindle cells,
apocrine differentiation, nucleoli (visibility at 10),
lymphoid infiltrate (10% or less/11%-50%/>50%), geographic necrosis, apoptosis (visibility at 10), ductal carcinoma in situ (type/grade/comedonecrosis), lobular
carcinoma in situ, and lymphovascular space invasion.
These criteria were slightly modified from the published
criteria by Fulford and colleagues.17

Patient Treatment With NACT
NACT given to patients included compounds that are
generally given as adjuvant chemotherapy.2 Because this
was not a clinical trial, the patient population was diverse
and the treatment received by patients was variable.
NACT given to the patients was mainly based on clinical
staging and physician discretion. The type of therapy
given can be broadly classified as anthracycline-based
therapy, ie, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) plus cyclophosphamide, 5-flurouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, or
taxane-based therapy, ie, taxol plus carboplatinum, and in
cases of HER2-positive tumors, such as taxol, carboplatinum, and trastuzumab. In many cases a sequential combination of anthracycline and taxane was given, ie,
doxorubicin (Adriamycin) plus cyclophosphamide followed
by taxane. The doses given were generally the recommended
doses per unit body surface area. The total number of cycles
ranged from 4-10 with an average total cycle number of 6.
Trastuzumab was part of the NACT regimen in only 6
ERBB2 tumors and 10 non-ERBB2, HER2-positive
tumors. Trastuzumab was more often administered as adjuvant therapy in HER2-positive tumors.
Response Assessment
Complete pathologic response was defined as absence of
invasive carcinoma in the post-therapy resection specimen
and within regional lymph nodes. Percentage tumor size
reduction was also calculated based on pretherapy clinical tumor size and residual tumor size in the resection specimen.
Clinical Follow-Up
Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated as the time
from the date of diagnosis of the primary tumor to the
date of the development of distant or locoregional recurrence. Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time
from the date of diagnosis of the primary tumor to the
date of death from any cause, or the date of last contact.
The data were analyzed for DFS and OS separately for
patients with complete pathologic response and patients
without complete pathologic response. Patient DFS and
OS with respect to molecular classes and tumor grade was
also analyzed.
Statistical Analysis
The chi-square (Monte Carlo method) test was used to
compare tumor stages among molecular classes and
NACT given among molecular classes. The KruskalWallis test was used to evaluate possible differences of ages
among molecular classes. Univariate logistic regression

analyses were performed for each potential predictor variable of complete pathologic response to NACT. Variables
were included in the multivariate analysis if the univariate
P-value was .25. A stepwise selection procedure was
used to predict the probability of achieving complete
pathologic response. The survival experience was examined with the 2 methods of time-to-event analyses: DFS
and OS. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were evaluated
for difference among groups with the log-rank test. P-values <.05 were considered statistically significant. The
data analysis for this paper was generated using SAS software, Version 9.2 of the SAS System for Windows, product of SAS Institute Inc. (Cary, NC).

RESULTS
The 359 tumors treated with NACT comprised 111
(31%) luminal A, 73 (20%) luminal B, 57 (16%)
ERBB2, 79 (22%) triple negative, 15 (4%) luminal AHER2 hybrid, and 24 (7%) luminal B-HER2 hybrid. As
these cases were considered for NACT, most were stage II
or higher at the time of diagnosis. There was no significant
difference in tumor stage among different molecular
classes (P ¼ .129). The patients with strong ERþ tumors
(luminal A and luminal A-HER2 hybrid with median age
of 53 and 54 years) were 5-10 years older than weak/moderate ER-positive and ER-negative tumors (luminal BHER2 hybrid, luminal B, ERBB2, triple negative with
median ages of 44, 47, 48, 49 years, respectively), a difference that was statistically significant (P ¼ .0002). The
patient clinical data and tumor characteristics are shown
in Table 3.
Molecular Class and Response to NACT
Of the 359 cases that could be classified using IHC surrogate markers, 48 cases (13%) demonstrated complete
pathologic response. The highest rate of complete pathologic response was seen in ERBB2 and triple-negative tumor classes with 33% (19 of 57) and 30% (24 of 79)
showing complete pathologic response, respectively (Table 4). Among the ERþ ‘‘molecular’’ groups, the highest

IHC Criteria and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy/Bhargava et al

rate of complete pathologic response was seen among
luminal B-HER2 hybrid tumors, 8% (2 of 24). The remainder of ERþ tumors demonstrated dismal rate of
complete pathologic response, 1.5% (3 of 198). Although
complete pathologic response information was available on
all 359 cases, tumor size reduction could not be analyzed
on 30% of cases because of lack of information about
either pretherapy tumor size or ambiguous reporting of the
post-therapy tumor size. The precise cellularity of the posttherapy residual tumor specimen was not available; therefore, quantification (such as Miller-Payne scoring)9,18 of
residual tumor was not feasible. Despite these shortcomings, the percentage tumor size reduction (available on
70% of cases) deduced from gross and microscopic
description provided a reasonable alternative to compare
tumor size reduction in different tumor classes. The mean
tumor size reduction was higher in ERBB2 and triple-negative tumors compared with other classes. The average percentage tumor size reduction in descending order was as
follows: triple negative (75%), ERBB2 (68%), luminal BHER2 hybrid (47%), luminal A-HER2 hybrid (33%),
luminal B (30%), and luminal A (23%).
Type and Amount of Chemotherapy
The patients received anthracycline-based or taxane-based
chemotherapy, with most receiving a sequential combination of both (Table 3). However, there were slight differences between chemotherapy given to patients depending
on receptor status, HER2 status, clinical stage, and physician preference. Despite this variability, there was no statistical difference for NACT given (for the most effective
regimen doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by
T) between patients that achieved complete pathologic
response and patients that failed to achieve complete pathologic response (P ¼ .9108). Trastuzumab was part of the
NACT regimen in 6 ERBB2 tumors, of which 5 (83%)
achieved complete pathologic response. In contrast, 10
patients with non-ERBB2, but HER2-positive tumors (ie,
luminal A-HER2 hybrid and luminal B-HER2 hybrid
tumors) received trastuzumab, of which none achieved
complete pathologic response.
Univariate Analysis of All the Analyzed
Variables for Complete Pathologic Response
In a univariate analysis, the following factors predicted
complete pathologic response: higher Nottingham tumor
grade, ER-negative molecular class, HER2 status, apocrine differentiation, necrosis, apoptosis, and presence of
spindle cells. However, it should be noted that with

Cancer

regards to morphologic features, data were available only
on 191 cases. If one closely examines each of these morphologic parameters, then the correlation between tumor
‘‘molecular’’ classes, morphology and tumor grade can be
identified as shown previously.19
Multivariate Analysis for Complete
Pathologic Response
The variables, HER2 status, Nottingham grade, spindle
cells, apocrine differentiation, geographic necrosis, apoptosis, stage, and molecular class (ERþ vs ER negative),
having P-values .25 in univariate analyses, were used to
build a model by using multivariate logistic regression.
However, only molecular class was found as a statistically
significant predictor for complete pathologic response.
The probability of complete pathologic response is lower
for patients who have ERþ disease than the patients having ER-negative breast cancer molecular class (OR ¼ 0.06
with 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.18).
Morphologic Analysis
Microscopic examination of 191 cases revealed a correlation between higher tumor grade and complete pathologic
response, as complete pathologic response was identified
in 1 of 13 (7%) of grade 1, 14 of 125 (11%) grade 2, and
14 of 53 (26%) of grade 3 tumors (P ¼ .0073 for grade 3
vs others). The most high-grade tumors (Nottingham
grade 3) were seen predominantly in the triple-negative
group (58% cases), less commonly in the ERBB2 (18%
cases) and luminal B-HER2 hybrid (11% cases) groups,
and least commonly in other molecular groups (ie, 13%
of combined luminal A, luminal B, and luminal A-HER2
hybrid cases). However, once the tumors were assigned to
one of the molecular classes, further division by Nottingham grade did not add any other information that would
have predicted complete pathologic response. In addition,
several morphologic features were associated with particular molecular class, such as necrosis and spindle cells with
triple-negative tumors, and apocrine differentiation with
ERBB2 class. The association of apocrine differentiation
with ERBB2 tumor class was quite strong and was identified in 26 of 29 (90%) ERBB2 tumors compared with 35
of 162 (22%) of all other tumors combined (P ¼ .0001).
Survival Analysis
An average of a 46-month follow-up period was available
on all cases. The average follow-up period was similar for
cases that showed complete pathologic response (mean,
46 months; median, 42 months; range, 21-99 months)
and for cases that did not show complete pathologic

Of the 48 patients that showed complete pathologic

tumors (P ¼ .0474).
To test the validity of ‘‘triple-negative paradox,’’ the
DFS and OS were compared between ER-negative
(ERBB2 and triple negative) and ERþ (luminal A, luminal B, luminal A-HER2 hybrid, and luminal B-HER2
hybrid) molecular classes in patients that did not achieve
complete pathologic response. The DFS and OS were
worse for ER-negative molecular classes (P ¼ .0007 for
DFS and <.0001 for OS; see Figs. 2A and 2B). The DFS
and OS for ERþ versus ER-negative tumors was also
examined after stratifying by stage and the data remained
statistically significant for each stage.

DISCUSSION
Breast cancer molecular classification using ‘‘intrinsic’’
gene set demonstrated distinct molecular classes
with prognostic significance.20-22 As per our current
Cancer

March 15, 2010

IHC Criteria and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy/Bhargava et al

understanding, these classes are luminal A, luminal B,
ERBB2, and basal-like.23 The so-called ‘‘normal breastlike’’ group of tumors is now believed to be an artifact of
sampling and likely represented poorly sampled tumor tissue rather than a distinct, clinically important group.23,24
The initially described luminal C category was later
included along with luminal B tumors.21,22 Most IHC
studies that followed extrapolated the gene expression
findings in less than optimal fashion. In a recent similar
study, Carey et al classified the tumors based on IHC as
luminal A (hormone receptorþ/HER2 negative), luminal
B (hormone receptorþ/HER2þ), HER2 group (hormone receptor negative/HER2þ), and basal subtype
(hormone receptor negative/HER negative). However,
the authors clearly indicated in their study that ‘‘hormone
receptorþ/HER2þ tumors comprise only a minority of
luminal B tumors, so this method of subcategorizing the
luminal subtype will necessarily misclassify a substantial
fraction of luminal B tumors into the luminal A category.’’11 We have previously raised similar concerns about
this issue.25 Therefore, to faithfully reproduce the gene
expression profiling studies, we have used semiquantitative IHC (see Table 2). We believe this distinction is necessary to study the impact of semiquantitative IHC
hormone receptor analysis and coexpression of hormone
receptors and HER2 on chemotherapeutic tumor
response and survival.
By using the simple IHC criteria shown in Table 2,
the study findings suggest that routine hormone receptor
and HER2 analysis can act as a substitute for expression
analysis in predicting complete pathologic response to
NACT. In one of the very first studies examining the relationship between breast cancer molecular classes (using
gene expression analysis) and NACT tumor response,
Rouzier et al demonstrated complete pathologic response
in 45% of ERBB2 and ‘‘basal-like’’ breast carcinomas
compared with only 6% complete pathologic response in
luminal tumors.10 Our results are very similar in the sense
that complete pathologic response was predominantly restricted to ERBB2 and triple-negative tumor classes; however, the percentages of cases showing complete
pathologic response are slightly lower (30%-33% vs
45%). This difference is likely explained by the larger and
more diverse study population in the current study and by
slight differences in chemotherapeutic regimen between
the 2 studies. However, our findings are very similar to
the results obtained by Carey and colleagues,11 and we
believe the response rates observed in the current study are
more representative of the clinical experience.

Our semiquantitative hormone receptor analysis
and IHC criteria for molecular classes were helpful in predicting complete pathologic response and also showed
subtle differences in percentage tumor size reduction
among these classes. Average tumor size reduction appears
to be related to the amount of ER expression and presence
of HER2 overexpression. Surgeons and oncologists alike
can use this information in making better decisions about
NACT. If the intent is to achieve complete pathologic
response, only triple-negative and ERBB2 tumors should
be considered for NACT. The only other tumor type that
may also be considered would be an luminal B-HER2
hybrid tumor. If the intent is to reduce tumor size so that
a smaller lumpectomy can be performed, then all tumors
may be considered knowing that the tumor size reduction
would be lowest in strong ERþ, HER2-negative tumors.
Because of short follow-up in the current study, the survival differences were not apparent among the ERþ
tumors, but were significantly different between ERþ and
ER-negative ‘‘molecular’’ classes. Despite the best
response to NACT, ERBB2 tumors and triple-negative
tumors showed the worst DFS and OS (5-year survival of
65% for stage II and 45% for stage III). This worse survival was seen only in the cases that did not achieve complete pathologic response, as cases that achieved complete
pathologic response had excellent survival irrespective of
the molecular class (5-year survival of 96%). Our findings
are concordant with Carey et al, who called this phenomenon ‘‘triple-negative paradox’’,11 ie, the good response to
NACT, but poor survival rates because of higher relapse
among those with residual disease. Because both triplenegative and ERBB2 tumors demonstrate this phenomenon, this triple-negative paradox should rather be called
‘‘hormone receptor-negative paradox.’’
One unique feature of our study was review of the
pretherapy tumor slides and detailed morphologic analysis on 191 cases. This examination showed that tumor
grades and molecular classes are not completely independent of each other. It was not surprising to see that 3 tumor
grades distinctly showed different response to NACT and
were also prognostic. The tumor grades and molecular
classes (as identified by IHC) are closely interlinked. Most
ERBB2 and triple-negative tumors are Nottingham grade
3, while luminal-type tumors are generally well-differentiated to moderately differentiated tumors. Although, both
ERBB2 and triple-negative tumors responds equally to
NACT, the morphologic examination suggested that the
mechanism of response is probably different. The triplenegative tumors are the most proliferative as was shown in

1437

Original Article

the initial gene-expression profiling study20,21 and later
confirmed with morphologic studies.26,27 The literature
also suggests that ERBB2 tumors are high-grade, but most
studies fail to mention that ERBB2 tumors are not as proliferative as triple-negative tumors. In the current study, a
mitotic activity score of 3 was identified in 22 of 40
(55%) triple-negative tumors in contrast to only 5 of 29
(17%) ERBB2 tumors. This suggests that effect of NACT
in triple-negative tumors is likely related to destruction of
rapidly proliferating cells but the effect of NACT in
ERBB2 tumors is related to mechanism other than inhibition of cellular proliferation. Rouzier et al also reached at
the same conclusion as the genes responsible for complete
pathologic response in ERBB2 and ‘‘basal-like’’ tumors in
their study were distinct in each group.10
Another instructive feature of our study was the difference in response rates among HER2þ tumors with the
inclusion of trastuzumab in the NACT regimen. The use
of trastuzumab in metastatic and adjuvant setting is now
well-established. However, the use of trastuzumab in the
neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting was mainly limited to
clinical trials before 2005. This explains why only a total
of 16 (of 96) HER2þ patients received trastuzumab in
our study. Despite these small numbers, the maximum
benefit was seen in ERBB2 (ERþ/PRþ/HER2þ) tumors
compared with luminal A-HER2 hybrid (strong ERþ/
HER2þ) and luminal B-HER2 hybrid (weak to moderate
ERþ/HER2þ) tumors. Although none of the luminal AHER2 hybrid or luminal B-HER2 hybrid tumors that
received trastuzumab showed complete pathologic
response in this study, the percentage tumor size reduction was far greater in luminal B-HER2 hybrid tumors
than in luminal A-HER2 hybrid tumors, indicating extent
of ER reactivity by IHC could influence tumor response
to trastuzumab. The effect of low ER expression on IHC
coupled with HER2 positivity was further exemplified by
8% complete pathologic response rate in luminal BHER2 hybrid tumors compared with only 1.5% complete
pathologic response rate in all other ERþ tumors.
In summary, we have shown that simple IHC-based
categorization of breast tumors can help predict extent of
tumor response to NACT. The predictive power of IHC
criteria appears to be similar to that of gene expression
analysis. There are morphologic and immunohistologic
correlates to molecular classes. Semiquantitative IHC
analyses of hormone receptors helps in better categorization of breast tumors than a mere positive or negative
result. This information can be used toward improved
therapeutic decisions.
