ABSTRACT:
Understanding genetic aberrations in cancer leads to discovery of new targets for
cancer therapies. The genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not
been fully described. Therefore, patients with refractory advanced/metastatic HCC
referred for experimental therapies, who had adequate tumor tissue available, had
targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of their tumor samples using the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 platform (Foundation One, Foundation Medicine, MA) and their treatment
outcomes were analyzed. In total, NGS was obtained for 14 patients (median number
of prior therapies, 1) with advanced/metastatic HCC. Of these 14 patients, 10 (71%)
were men, 4 (29%) women, 6 (43%) had hepatitis B or C-related HCC. NGS revealed
at least 1 molecular abnormality in 12 patients (range 0-8, median 2). Detected
molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
(n=3 [mTOR, PIK3CA, NF1]), Wnt pathway (n=6 [CTNNA1, CTNNB1]), MAPK pathway
(n=2 [MAP2K1, NRAS]), and aberrant DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control and
apoptosis (n=18 [ATM, ATR, BAP1, CCND1, CDKN2A,CDK4, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, MCL1,
MDM2, RB1, TP53]). Of the 3 patients with molecular aberrations putatively activating
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, 2 received therapies including a mTOR inhibitor and all
demonstrated therapeutic benefit ranging from a partial response to minor shrinkage
per RECIST (-30%, -15%; respectively). In conclusion, genomic alterations are
common in advanced HCC. Refractory patients with alterations putatively activating
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway demonstrated early signals of clinical activity when
treated with therapies targeting mTOR.

INTRODUCTION

leading cause of death after lung and gastric cancers, but
lacks molecular targets or signatures.[3] HCC comprises
several distinct entities defined by etiology, and often
arises in the wake of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction.
Most cases of HCC are associated with hepatitis B or
hepatitis C, as well as metabolic derangements such as
alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. It
is plausible that each entity may have a different molecular
genetic profile that determines biological behavior,
prognosis and response to molecularly targeted therapy.
[4] Currently, complete resection or liver transplant

The discovery of mutated “cancer genes”,
has provided key insights into the mechanisms of
tumorigenesis, which has been useful for developing
targeted cancer therapies. Most recent examples include
ALK inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer with an ALK
rearrangement or BRAF inhibitors in melanoma with a
BRAF mutation.[1, 2]
Yet, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most common malignancies worldwide and the third

tumor suppressor p53; therefore, amplification of MDM2
may be oncogenic (Figure 2). MDM2 amplification has
been identified according to some data in up to 44%
of patients with HCC.[10] It is assumed that MDM2
amplification may predict sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors;
however, currently available evidence is inconclusive.
[11] At the time of referral to the CCTT the patient had
metastatic disease to lungs and bones and subsequently
received experimental therapy with sorafenib (200 mg
orally twice a day), temsirolimus (15 mg intravenously
weekly), and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg intravenously every
3 weeks), which did not match any molecular target.
Although the patient demonstrated a 25% improvement
per RECIST after 8 weeks of therapy, he ultimately
progressed in his bones after 2.8 months of therapy.
Patient 2, an African American male, was diagnosed
at the age of 51 years with hepatitis C and cirrhosisrelated HCC (Table 1). He progressed after 1.8 months
of firstline therapy with sorafenib. NGS performed on
a tumor sample from the chest wall biopsy obtained
at the time of diagnosis revealed PIK3CA mutation
H1047R, CTNNB1 mutation S37C, and protein tyrosine
phosphatase delta (PTPRD) mutation S1845fs*2
(Figure 1). PIK3CA encodes the active subunit of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which regulates
cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility and
survival (Figure 2).[12] Mutations in PIK3CA have been
reported in 7% of liver cancer cases.[7] Preclinical and
early clinical data suggest that activating mutations in
PIK3CA may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway.[12-14] CTNNB1 encodes betacatenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway
(Figure 2). CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, such as S37C, are
considered to be activating and lead to activation of the
Wnt pathway.[15] CTNNB1 mutations have been reported
in 19% of HCC.[7] PTPRD, a tumor suppressor, plays an
essential role in dephosphorylating STAT3 (Figure 2).[16]
Mutations in PTPRD occur only sporadically in HCC
(1%).[7] S1845fs*2 is a frameshift mutation that truncates
the PTPRD protein within the second tyrosine phosphatase
domain (amino acids 1644-1903) only 1 amino acid
from the phosphatase active site, possibly resulting in an
inactive protein. At the time of referral to the CCTT the
patient had metastatic disease to the mediastinum, bones,
and liver and subsequently received experimental therapy
with a mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (4 mg orally daily) in
combination with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC)
vorinostat (300 mg orally daily), which was matching a
molecular abnormality in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
(PIK3CA H1047R mutation) and attained 15% shrinkage
per RECIST. He progressed after 3.8 months.[17] Then
he received a mTOR inhibitor everolimus (10 mg orally
every other day) and multikinase inhibitor pazopanib
(600 mg orally every other day), which again targeted the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and induced 11% shrinkage
per RECIST after 2 months, but he progressed after a

are the only therapeutic approaches offering long-term
survival. Most patients (>85%) with HCC present with
advanced disease and about 12 months of survival on
standard therapies.[5, 6] HCC is a highly heterogeneous
tumor for which molecular signatures or druggable targets
remain to be identified. According to the COSMIC
database, which includes data from cell lines and tumor
samples, there have been 1,709 oncogenes with oncogenic
mutations identified in HCC to date (accessed 2/12/2013).
[7] Mutations are primarily prevalent in TP53 (31%),
CTNNB1 (19%), AXIN1 (16%), NFE2L2 (14%), ARID2
(13%), and PIK3CA (7%).[7] However, systematic efforts
to delineate the molecular profile of HCC in a large group
of tumor samples from patients are still underway (http://
cancergenome.nih.gov/).[8] Here we report the results of
targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and treatment
outcomes in a case series of 14 patients with advanced/
metastatic HCC.

RESULTS
PATIENTS
A total of 14 patients with advanced metastatic
HCC were analyzed with NGS, of whom 10 (71%) were
men and 4 (29%) women. Their median age at diagnosis
was 58 years (range, 27 to 79 years) and 10 (71.5%)
patients were White, 3 (21.5%) African American, and 1
(7%) Asian. In addition, 3 (21.5%) patients had hepatitis
C-related HCC, 1 (7%) hepatitis B-related HCC, 2
(14.5%) hepatitis B and C-related HCC and 8 (57%) had
HCC without identified predisposing factors. Patients
received a median of 1 (range, 1-4) therapies prior to being
referred for experimental therapies to the Clinical Center
for Targeted Therapy (CCTT).

Molecular profiling and treatment outcomes
Patient 1, an Asian male, was diagnosed at the
age of 56 years with hepatitis B-related HCC and was
initially treated with a liver transplant (Table 1). At the
time of disease recurrence, the patient received firstline
therapy with sorafenib and progressed after 4 months.
NGS performed on a tumor sample from the epidural
biopsy obtained after the firstline therapy revealed an ATR
W463* mutation and MDM2 amplification (Figure 1).
ATR encodes the protein ataxia telangiectasia, which plays
a key role in maintaining genomic integrity via regulation
of DNA repair and replication (Figure 2).[9] The ATR
W463*mutation truncates the ATR protein and is likely to
lead to a loss of protein function. In HCC ATR mutations
have been reported anecdotally.[7] Based on preclinical
evidence, ATR-deficient tumors may be sensitive to PARP
inhibitors.[9] MDM2 acts to prevent the activity of the

total of 2.9 months. The patient then received the EGFR
inhibitor erlotinib (100 mg orally daily) and antimetabolite
praletrexate (15 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for 3 weeks
followed by a week off), which did not match any of the
detected abnormalities and progressed after 2.1 months
with no initial response.
Patient 3, a White male, was diagnosed at the age
of 59 years with hepatitis C-related HCC and history of
hepatitis B. He was initially treated with a liver transplant.
At the time of the second disease recurrence he progressed
on firstline therapy with sorafenib after 5.9 months.
NGS of a tumor sample obtained from a lung resection
performed at the time of the first recurrence after the initial
liver transplantation revealed RB1 loss (Figure 1). RB1
encodes the retinoblastoma protein, a tumor suppressor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and negative regulator of the cell cycle (Figure 2).[18]
The loss of RB1 protein expression has been linked to
poor survival and may prognosticate a decreased response
to kinase inhibitors.[18] RB1 mutations have been
reported sporadically in HCC.[7] At the time of referral
to the CCTT the patient had metastatic disease to the
right pterygoid fossa and liver and his clinical condition
precluded experimental therapy.
Patient 4, a White male, was diagnosed at the age of
57 years with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and alcohol-related
HCC. He was initially treated with liver transplantation
and at the time of disease recurrence he received firstline
therapy with sorafenib and progressed after 7 months.
NGS performed on the tumor sample from the liver
transplant after diagnosis revealed CTNNB1 mutation

I35S, and TP53 V143M mutation (Figure 1). The CTNNB1
gene plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway and is
characterized in detail above and the I35S mutation is
considered to be activating (Figure 2).[15] Functional loss
of tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53
gene, is common in advanced cancers (Figure 2).[19]
TP53 V143M mutation is located within the DNA-binding
domain of the p53 protein, which is thought to result in loss
of function.[20] Mutations of TP53 have been reported in
31% of cases of HCC.[7] A recent meta-analysis reported
that HCC patients with TP53 alterations experienced
significantly shorter recurrence-free survival and overall
survival.[19] There are no approved therapies to address
TP53 mutations; however, tumors with TP53 mutations
may be sensitive to Wee1 inhibitors, which are in clinical
trials. At the time of referral to the CCTT the patient had
metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, retroperitoneum, and
bones. He did not receive experimental therapy because of
insurance denial.
Patient 5, a White male, was diagnosed at the age
of 66 years with hepatitis C-related HCC. He was initially
treated with sorafenib and progressed after 15.5 months;
however, during that period of time he also underwent
transarterial chemoembolization of the liver. NGS of a
tumor sample obtained from a liver biopsy performed at
the time of diagnosis revealed CDKN2A mutation H83Y
and CTNNB1 mutation T41A (Figure 1). The CDKN2A
gene encodes the tumor suppressor p16(Ink4a), which
plays a vital role in cell cycle G1 checkpoint regulation
and its deletion contributes to inactivation of the p16CDK4/Cyclin/Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control
(Figure 2).[21] The CDKN2A H83Y mutation leads to a
reduced ability to induce cell cycle arrest. CTNNB1, a key
component of the Wnt signaling pathway, is characterized
above (Figure 2).[15] CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, such as
T41A, are considered to be activating the Wnt pathway.
[22] At the time of referral to the CCTT the patient had
metastatic disease to the liver and decided to pursue
therapeutic options outside of MD Anderson.
Patient 6, a White male, was diagnosed at the age
of 61 years with hepatitis C-related HCC (Table 1). He
was initially treated with sorafenib and progressed after
4.5 months. NGS of a tumor sample obtained from a
bone biopsy performed at the time of diagnosis revealed
CTNNA1 mutation K889* and CTNNB1 mutation
T41A (Figure 1). The CTNNA1 gene plays a role in cell
adhesion downstream in the Wnt signaling pathway
(Figure 2).[15] The CTNNA1 K889* mutation is expected
to be inactivating; however, its functional consequencies
are not fully understood. CTNNB1, a key component
of the Wnt signaling pathway, is characterized above
(Figure 2).[15] CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, such as
T41A, are considered to be activating the Wnt pathway.
[22] At the time of referral to the CCTT the patient had
metastatic disease to his liver, adrenal glands and bones
and subsequently received experimental therapy with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hepatic arterial infusion oxaliplatin (140 mg/m2 every
3 weeks), intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every
3 weeks) and oral; capecitabine (1500 mg/m2 on days
1-4 every 3 weeks) and progressed after 2.2 months.
The experimental therapies did not match any detected
molecular abnormality.
Patient 7, an African American female, was
diagnosed at the age of 46 years with HCC (Table
1). She progressed on firstline therapy with sorafenib
after 2.1 months. Then she progressed after 1.3 months
of experimental therapy with an oncolytic virus and
ultimately responded very well to a combination
of bevacizumab and erlotinib, which she received
twice with a PFS of 16.8 months and 10.1 months,
respectively. NGS performed on a tumor sample from a
liver biopsy obtained at the time of diagnosis revealed
NF1 mutation R1241*,  BAP1 truncation (exon 12),
and CTNNB1 mutation N387K (Figure 1). NF1 encodes
neurofibromin 1, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that
is a key negative regulator of the RAS and PI3K signaling
pathway (Figure 2).[23] The NF1 R1241* mutation leads
to a nonsense codon, resulting in truncation of the NF1
protein within the GAP-related domain, which is likely
to negate tumor suppressing activity. NF1 mutations
have been reported in 10% of HCC samples and such
tumors may thus be sensitive to PI3K/AKT/mTOR and
MAPK inhibitors.[7, 24] BAP1 rearrangement results in
a truncation of the BAP1 protein (Figure 2). The resulting
truncated protein product is believed to be nonfunctional.
[25] BAP1 rearrangements have not been previously
reported in HCC.[7] While there are no therapies that
directly target BAP1 loss, HDAC inhibitors are being
explored based on the results of a preclinical study.[26]
CTNNB1, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway,
is characterized above (Figure 2).[15] N387K is a rare
mutation, located in the region responsible for binding to
APC.[27] N387K has not been characterized, but other
mutations in this region were shown to abrogate APC
binding, although beta catenin was still degraded in the
presence of these mutations.[27] The functional effect of
N387K is unknown. At the time of referral to the CCTT the
patient had metastatic disease to her lungs, mediastinum,
peritoneum and liver and subsequently received the
experimental therapy with mTOR inhibitor everolimus
(7.5 mg orally every other day) and multikinase inhibitor
pazopanib (600 mg orally every other day), which was
matched to a molecular abnormality activating the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway (NF1 R1241*mutation). Restaging
CT scans revealed a PR (-30% per RECIST), which was
maintained for the total of 8.3 months. Then the patient
received the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (5 mg orally daily)
and HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (300 mg orally daily),
which again targeted the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and
was due to have her first reassessment after 2 months at
the time of analysis.
Patient 8, an African American female, was
3016

Oncotarget

diagnosed at the age of 56 years years with HCC with
islands of cholangiocarcinoma (Table 1). She underwent
a left hepatectomy and at the time of disease recurrence
was treated with firstline therapy sorafenib and progressed
after 10.7 months. Then she received a combination
of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine and progressed after
6.6 months, followed by treatment with 5-fluorouracil,
leucovorin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab, but progressed
after 1.6 months. NGS performed on a tumor sample
from the liver resection obtained at the time of diagnosis
revealed BAP1 mutation L65* (Figure 1). A BAP1 L65*
mutation in this tumor results in a truncation of the BAP1
protein near the amino terminus. Details about BAP1 are
outlined above (Figure 2) [25]. At the time of referral to
the CCTT the patient had metastatic disease to her lungs,
mediastinal and hilar nodes, porta hepatis, peritoneum,
and liver and subsequently received experimental therapy
with mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (4 mg orally daily). She
progressed after 1.4 months and then received hepatic
arterial infusion nab-paclitaxel (180 mg/m2 every 3
weeks) and intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every
3 weeks) and gemcitabine (800 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8
every 3 weeks) and progressed after 1.6 months. None of
the experimental therapies was matched to any detected
molecular abnormalities.
Patient 9, a White male, was diagnosed at the age of
65 years with HCC, which was initially treated with a right
hepatectomy and radiofrequency ablation. At the time of
disease recurrence he was treated on firstline therapy with
cisplatin, interferon, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil and
remained progression-free for 23.7 months. He was next
treated with capecitabine and progressed after 1.8 months,
then treated on a clinical trial with regorafenib for 49.3
months and then with sorafenib, but progressed after 1.7
months. NGS performed on a tumor sample from the
liver resection obtained at the time of diagnosis revealed
mTOR mutation S2215Y and FLT3 mutation splice
site 1418+2A>G (Figure 1). mTOR acts downstream
of multiple pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway (Figure 2). This mTOR S2215Y mutation is
located in the kinase domain.[28] The S2215Y mutation
has been reported to result in constitutive activation of
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) but not mTORC2 and to
retain sensitivity to sirolimus.[29] Mutations in mTOR
have not yet been reported in HCC.[7] FLT3 encodes a
receptor tyrosine kinase. Signaling through the FLT3
pathway leads to phosphorylation of SHC1 and AKT1
and activation of mTOR, as well as RAS activation and
phosphorylation of ERK1 and 2 (Figure 2).[30] The
1418+2A>G splice site mutation seen in this tumor
disrupts the canonical GT splice-donor site of the 5’ end
of the intron separating exon 11 and exon 12; however,
the resulting GC dinucleotide sequence has been reported
as a non-canonical splice site in the human genome.[31]
Mutation of the conserved 5’ GT splice site often results
in exclusion of the neighboring exon, but may also result
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in truncation of the encoded protein.[32] This alteration
has not been previously reported and its consequences
are difficult to predict. Among FDA approved therapies
sorafenib is known to be a FLT3 inhibitor and regorafenib
also has weak anti-FLT3 activity.[33] At the time of
referral to the CCTT the patient had metastatic disease
to the liver and spleen. The patient did not receive
experimental therapy due to his worsening performance
status.
Patient 10 (White female diagnosed with HCC at the
age of 67 years) had no molecular abnormality revealed
through NGS.
Patient 11, a White male, was diagnosed at the age
of 70 years with HCC, which was initially treated with a
right partial hepatectomy. At the time of disease recurrence
he was treated on firstline therapy with sorafenib and was
taken off therapy after 4.6 months because of squamous
cell carcinomas related to sorafenib therapy. NGS
performed on a tumor sample from the liver resection
performed at the time of disease recurrence revealed
ATM mutation K53fs*3 and a TP53 A161S and M160I
mutations. In addition, MET, CDK4, MAP2K1, MCL1,
MDM2, NRAS amplifications were found (Figure 1). ATM
encodes the protein ataxia telangiectasia mutated, which
plays a key role in sensing double-strand DNA breaks
and activating cellular checkpoint pathways, arresting the
cell cycle when DNA damage is present (Figure 2).[34]
ATM K53fs*3 mutation is predicted to be inactivating
due to loss of most of the ATM protein, including the
kinase domain. According to the COSMIC database ATM
mutations were found in all 4 tested HCC samples.[7]
Preclinical evidence suggested that ATM deficient tumors
may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.[35] Functional loss
of TP53 is common in aggressive advanced cancers and
is described in detail above (Figure 2).[19] Both A161
and M160 are located within the DNA-binding domain of
TP5. While the A161S mutation is predicted to be severe,
the M160I mutation is predicted to be non-severe.[36]
DNA-binding domain mutations are thought to result in
loss of function.[20] MET encodes a receptor tyrosine
kinase that is activated by the ligand HGF, and MET
activation promotes angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis,
proliferation, and invasion of cancer cells (Figure 2).[37]
MET amplification has been reported in 2% of HCC.
[38] MET amplification may predict sensitivity to MET
inhibitors, some of which are FDA approved (crizotinib,
cabozantinib).[39] CDK4 encodes cyclin-dependent
kinase 4, which, along with functional homolog CDK6
and family member CDK2, regulates cell cycle G1 phase
progression and the G1/S transition (Figure 2).[40] CDK4
amplification has been reported in 2% of HCC samples.
[38] There are currently no approved therapies that
directly target CDK4; however a number of drugs are
under investigation in clinical trials. MAP2K1 (also known
as MEK1) encodes the signaling protein mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase 1. MEK1 phosphorylates the ERK1/2

RB1 and progression of the cell cycle. Amplification of
CCND1 may therefore lead to increased proliferation.
CCND1 amplification has been reported in 4% of HCC.
[47] FGF3 encodes fibroblast growth factors 19, an
FGFR4 ligand involved in regulation of hepatic protein
and glycogen metabolism.[48] FGF3 plays a central
role in development of the inner ear and FGF3 germline
mutations give rise to an autosomal recessive syndrome
characterized by microdontia, deafness and complete
lack of inner ear structures.[49] FGF4 plays a central role
in tooth development.[50] At the time of referral to the
CCTT the patient had metastatic disease to the liver and
subsequently received experimental therapy with oral an
daily dose of an experimental MET kinase inhibitor, which
did not match any detected molecular abnormality. He had
stable disease (+14% per RECIST) and progressed after
4.0 months.	
Patient 13 (White male diagnosed with HCC at the
age of 27 years) had no molecular abnormality revealed
through NGS.
Patient 14, a White female, was diagnosed at the
age of 53 years with HCC (Table 1). She progressed
after 6 months of firstline therapy with sorafenib. Then
she received experimental therapy with bevacizumab and
erlotinib and progressed after 1.8 months. NGS performed
on a tumor sample from the liver biopsy obtained at the
time of diagnosis revealed RB1 loss (Figure 1). RB1
encoding the Rb protein is characterized above (Figure
2).[18] At the time of referral to the CCTT the patient had
metastatic disease to her lungs, mediastinum and liver and
subsequently received experimental therapy with hepatic
arterial infusion oxaliplatin (140 mg/m2 every 3 weeks),
intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 3 weeks) and
oral capecitabine (1500 mg/m2 on days 1-4 every 3 weeks)
and was taken off therapy after 2.9 months because of
poor tolerance. The experimental therapies did not match
any detected molecular abnormality.

proteins in the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway (Figure 2).[41]
MAP2K1 amplification has been reported in 2% of HCC
samples.[38] The relationship between MEK amplification
and sensitivity to MEK inhibitors is unknown. MCL1
encodes the protein MCL1, which is a member of the
BCL2 family and can result in antiapoptotic activity
(Figure 2).[42] MCL1 amplification has been reported in
12% of HCC.[38] There are no FDA approved therapies
to address MCL1 copy number amplification at this time,
but investigations focused on small molecule inhibitors of
MCL1 are underway. In addition, the multikinase inhibitor
sorafenib has been shown to down-regulate MCL1 and
thereby induce apoptosis in preclinical studies.[43] Also,
preclinical studies of patient-derived tumor cells suggest
that increased MCL1 levels may confer resistance to
antitubulin therapies such as paclitaxel.[44] MDM2 acts
to prevent the activity of the tumor suppressor p53 and its
function is described in detail above.[10] NRAS encodes a
member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate
transduction of growth signals (Figure 2).[41] Activation
of RAS signaling causes cell growth, differentiation, and
survival by activating the RAF/MAPK/ERK, PI3K, and
other pathways. NRAS amplification has not been reported
in HCC.[38] There are no approved therapies to address
cancers associated with NRAS amplification or activating
mutations. NRAS putatively leads to activation of the
RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Therefore, NRAS activation
might theoretically predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.
At the time of referral to the CCTT the patient had
metastatic disease to the liver, but decided not to receive
experimental therapy.
Patient 12, a White male, was diagnosed at the
age of 79 years with idiopathic cirrhosis-related HCC
(Table 1). He progressed after 2.7 months of firstline
therapy with sorafenib. Then he received experimental
therapy with bevacizumab and erlotinib and progressed
after 3.8 months. NGS performed on a tumor sample
from the liver biopsy obtained at the time of diagnosis
revealed CDKN2A mutation A102P, ARID1A mutation
I1485fs*5, CCND1 amplification, FGF19 amplification,
FGF3 amplification and FGF4 amplification (Figure 1).
CDKN2A regulates the p16-CDK4/Cyclin/Rb pathway
and is characterized above (Figure 2).[21] The CDKN2A
A102P mutation has not been characterized, but it is
likely to be inactivating.[45] Overall, CDKN2A mutations
has been reported in 8% of HCC.[7] ARID1A encodes
the AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A, a
member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex.
ARID1A is believed to function as a tumor suppressor
and deletion of ARID1A can lead to tumor formation.
[46] The I1485fs*5 mutation results in truncation of the
protein and similar truncations have been predicted to be
inactivating.[46] ARID1A mutations have been reported
in HCC in the COSMIC database.[7] CCND1 encodes
Cyclin D1, which interacts with the cyclin-dependent
kinases CDK4 and Cdk6, resulting in inactivation of

DISCUSSION
Targeted NGS analysis of tumor samples from 14
consecutive patients with advanced HCC refractory to
standard therapies referred to the CCTT for experimental
therapies with targeted agents revealed that 12 (86%)
patients had at least one somatic molecular aberration
(median, 2; range, 0-8) in their tumor samples (activating
mutations, n=6; loss of function mutations, n=10;
mutations with unknown effects, n=6; copy number
variations, n=11; rearrangements, n=1) and 9 (64%) had
more than one molecular aberration. Of interest, molecular
aberrations were found in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
(mTOR, n=1; PIK3CA, n=1; NF1, n=1), Wnt pathway
(CTNNA1, n=1, CTNNB1, n=5), the MAPK pathway
(MAP2K1, n=1; NRAS, n=1), DNA repair mechanisms,
cell cycle control and apoptosis (ATM, n=1, ATR, n=1;
BAP1, n=2, CCND1, n=1; CDKN2A, n=2; CDK4, n=1;

FGF3, n=1; FGF4, n=1, FGF19, n=1; MCL1, n=1;
MDM2, n=2; RB1, n=2; TP53, n=2). Six (43%) patients
with HCC in the context of hepatitis B (n=1), hepatitis C
(n=3) or both (n=2) had molecular abnormalities related
to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (PIK3CA, n=1), Wnt
pathway (CTNNA1, n=1; CTNNB1, n=4), STAT3 signaling
(PTPRD, n=1), DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control
and apoptosis (ATR, n=1; CDKN2A, n=1; RB1, n=1;
MDM2, n=1; TP53, n=1). Despite the fact that several
patients had aberrations in some genes such as CTTNB1
and CDKN2A, the specific combination of aberrations
and their subtypes were unique to each individual patient,
important distinctions for selecting personalized cancer
therapies.
Patients with hepatitis B or C-related HCC had a
median of 2 aberrations (range, 1-3), which was similar
to a median of 1.5 aberration in patients without hepatitis
(range, 0-8; p = 0.74). To date, the molecular landscape
of HCC has not been clearly defined and major initiatives
such as The Cancer Genome Atlas are in progress. Only
limited data on copy number variations are available,
demonstrating that MCL1, and BAP1 are the most frequent
copy number abnormalities (12%, 4%, respectively).
[38] According to the COSMIC database, the genes
most frequently mutated include TP53 (31%), CTNNB1
(19%), AXIN1 (16%), NFE2L2 (14%), ARID2 (13%),
and PIK3CA (7%).[7] An integrated analysis of somatic
mutations and focal copy number variations with whole
exome sequencing of 24 HCC cases revealed recurrent
mutations in CTNBB1 (46%), AXIN1 (21%), TP53 (13%),
CDKN2A (8%), and ARID2 (8%).[51] CTTNB1 was also
the most frequently mutated gene in our study (5/14,
36%). Of interest mTOR mutation S2215Y has never been
reported before in HCC.
Of the 14 patients in our study, 3 (21%) had
genomic alterations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway and 2 such patients received therapies
that included an mTOR inhibitor. Both patients had some
therapeutic benefit ranging from a PR to minor shrinkage
per RECIST (-30%, -15%; respectively), which was
maintained for 3.8 months and 8.3 months. According to
the COSMIC database, with the exception of PIK3CA,
none of the mutations putatively leading to PI3K/AKT/
mTOR activation are commonly found in HCC; however,
preclinical models and early clinical data generally
suggest that targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can
be an effective strategy in subsets of patients with HCC.
[52, 53] However, none of the studies investigated these
therapies in HCC with PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation.[54,
55] Revisiting such studies with gating of HCC patient for
alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may yield
better evidence of the efficacy of inhibitors of the PI3K/
mTOR pathway in this difficult to treat disease.[56-58]
In conclusion, we have identified multiple molecular
abnormalities in a small data set of patients with advanced
HCC. Interestingly, a proportion of our patients had
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

molecular aberrations putatively associated with PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway activation and these patients
attained some benefit (although not always durable)
from targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Despite
several limitations such as small patient numbers, absence
of randomization and control groups, our data suggest
that comprehensive molecular profiling can increase our
knowledge of HCC biology to an unprecedented level,
which can be translated to patient care.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
We reviewed the electronic medical records of
consecutive patients with advanced/metastatic HCC
(excluding fibrolamellar type given its distinct entity and
natural history) referred to the CCTT at MD Anderson
Cancer Center. Data were collected from transcribed notes
and radiology reports in the electronic medical record and
other source documentation. Registering patients in the
database, clinical, pathologic, laboratory and pathology
assessment were performed at MD Anderson. The study
and all treatments were conducted in accordance with
the guidelines of the MD Anderson Institutional Review
Board.

Molecular analysis
Archival tumor samples obtained from standard
diagnostic or therapeutic procedures were tested with
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment-certified
targeted NGS (Foundation One, Foundation Medicine,
MA) using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Genomic
libraries were captured for 3,230 exons representing the
complete coding sequence of 182 cancer-related genes
plus 37 introns from 14 genes often rearranged in cancer
and sequenced to an average median depth of 734X with
99% of bases covered >100X. On January 1, 2013, the
platform was upgraded to cover 3,769 exons of 236
cancer-related genes and 47 introns from 19 genes to an
average depth of 1000X.

Treatment
Patients were enrolled in clinical trials according
to the discretion of treating physicians and availability
of clinical trials at the time of enrollment. Treatment
continued until disease progression or unacceptable
toxicity. Treatment was carried out according to the
specific requisites in the treatment protocols selected.
Assessments,
including
history,
physical
examination, and laboratory evaluations, were performed

as specified in each protocol, typically before the initiation
of therapy, weekly during the first cycle, and then, at a
minimum, at the beginning of each new treatment cycle.
Response was assessed from computed tomography
(CT) scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
at baseline before treatment initiation and then every
2 cycles (6-8 weeks). All radiographs were read in the
Department of Radiology at MD Anderson and reviewed
in the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics
tumor measurement clinic. Responses were categorized
per RECIST criteria and categorized as complete response
(CR); partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or
progressive disease (PD).[17]
