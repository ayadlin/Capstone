ABSTRACT
Over the past decades, Salmonella has been proven capable of inhibiting
tumor growth. It can specifically target tumors and due to its facultative anaerobic
property, can be more penetrative than other drug therapies. However, the molecular
mechanism by which Salmonella inhibits tumor growth is still incompletely known.
The antitumor therapeutic effect mediated by Salmonella is associated with an
inflammatory immune response at the tumor site and a T cell-dependent immune
response. Many tumors have been proven to have a high expression of indoleamine 2,
3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), which is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes tryptophan to
kynurenine, thus causing immune tolerance within the tumor microenvironment. With
decreased expression of IDO, increased immune response can be observed, which
might be helpful when developing cancer immunotherapy. The expression of IDO
was decreased after tumor cells were infected with Salmonella. In addition, Western
blot analysis showed that the expression levels of phospho-protein kinase B (P-AKT),
phospho-mammalian targets of rapamycin (P-mTOR), and phospho-p70 ribosomal
s6 kinase (P-p70s6K) in tumor cells were decreased after Salmonella infection. In
conclusion, our results indicate that Salmonella inhibits IDO expression and plays
a crucial role in anti-tumor therapy, which might be a promising strategy combined
with other cancer treatments.

INTRODUCTION

was found to replicate much more in tumors than in
normal tissue. [8, 9].
Until now, one of the barriers to curing cancer
has been tumor immune tolerance, which renders host
immunity unable effectively to recognize or kill tumor
cells; in some situations, immune cells even undergo
inactivation cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [10, 11]. Some
factors have been reported that give tumor cells the ability
to escape from host immunity, including interferon-γ
(IFN-γ) [12], galectin [13], transforming growth factor
β (TGF-β) [14], and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1
(IDO1) [15]. In particular, IDO increase the concentration
of kynurenine, leading to activation of regulatory T cells,
inactivation of effective T cells and even apoptosis of
immune cells [16]. There are some treatments that focus on
overcoming this obstacle. 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT) is
an analog of IDO substrate that has a higher affinity and is
usually used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs

Bacterial cancer therapy can be traced back to the
19th century: a sarcoma surgeon found that bacterial
infection has a beneficial influence on patients with tumors
[1]. Since then, researchers have been developed many
cancer therapies based on the use of bacteria, attenuated
bacteria strains or bacterial products such as Streptococcus
and Serratia species [2, 3], Clostridia species [4], and
Mycobacterium bovis-made Bacillus Calmette-Guerin,
commonly used in bladder cancer [5]. Salmonella is one
bacterium that has been known for years to have proven
antitumor efficacy. This species has several advantages
that apply to cancer therapy: because it is flagellated,
Salmonella can penetrate deeply into tumor tissue yet
viruses, drugs and antibodies cannot [6] and because it
is a facultative anaerobe, Salmonella can colonize small
metastatic and larger tumors [7]. Additionally, Salmonella

(D-1-MT) and 1-methyl-L-tryptophan  (L-1-MT).
L-1- MT is considered as a more potent IDO inhibitor,
while D-1-MT was commonly chosen for clinical trial
with more effective antitumor activity and superior ability
of abrogating immune inhibition [18]. However, there are
still some concerns about administering 1-MT [19].
Previous studies have demonstrated that Salmonella
can decrease angiogenesis and increase infiltration of
immune cells within a tumor region, ultimately leading to
inhibition of tumor growth [20]. Some studies indicate that
Salmonella activates the CD8+ T cell immune response
to eliminate tumor cells [21]. This phenomenon can be
verified in a T cell-deficient mouse, in which Salmonellamediated tumor regression was inhibited, as was the
infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the tumor
region [22]. These findings suggest that Salmonella might
mainly activate CD8+ T cell immunity within a tumor
region. Thus, we postulate that the underlying mechanism
is that Salmonella can break IDO-mediated immune
tolerance in the tumor microenvironment.
Autophagy is a term first coined by Christian de
Duve and describes a process in which cells degrade
misfolded or aggregated protein or even organelles to
recycle the components to help the cell overcome stress
[23]. Some cancer cells are believed to have a reduced
autophagic property, thereby promoting oncogenesis [24].
Moreover, our and other studies indicate that Salmonella
can induce autophagy of immune cells and tumor cells
through phospho-protein kinase B (P-AKT)/phosphomammalian targets of the rapamycin (P-mTOR) pathway
[25]. The regulation of autophagy can also affected by the
upstream factor controlling IDO expression, which infers
that autophagy might be related to the immune response
[26]. These findings connect the relationships between
Salmonella, cancer and host immunity, while the detailed
molecular mechanism still needs further investigation. As
a result, we postulate that Salmonella-induced autophagy
is involved in the process of Salmonella regulating IDO to
hinder tumor immune tolerance. We hope these findings
can lead to a potential treatment that evokes host immunity
to conquer cancer.

and 4T1 has impact on T cell survival. The culture medium
of cells which have been treated with Salmonella was used
to incubate Jurkat cells (T cells) to measure T cell viability.
The results show that the amounts of T cells are highest
when T cells were cultured in medium of cells treated with
highest dose of Salmonella compared with control group
(Figure 1C and 1D). These results suggest that Salmonella
can increase the survival rate of T cells through inhibiting
kynurenine produced by tumor cells.

Salmonella regulated IDO expression through
phospho-protein kinase B (P-AKT)/phosphomammalian targets of the rapamycin (P-mTOR)
pathway
We demonstrated that Salmonella can decrease
the production of kynurenine and reverse kynureninemediated T cell death. As a result, the enzyme responsible
for kynurenine production, IDO, should be inhibited by
Salmonella. B16F10 cells and 4T1 cells were treated
with various degrees of infection (MOI) of Salmonella
to investigate the ability of Salmonella to IDO through
induction of AKT/mTOR pathway. The AKT/mTOR/
p70 ribosomal s6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway
negatively regulates autophagy. We next examined the
AKT/mTOR/ p70S6K signaling pathway after Salmonella
infection. In a dose-dependent manner, treatment with
Salmonella decreased the phosphorylation of AKT,
mTOR and p70S6K, indicating inhibition of the AKT/
mTOR/p70S6K pathway by Salmonella in B16F10 cells
(Figure 2A). Furthermore, very similar results were
observed when Salmonella was used to treat 4T1 cells
(Figure 2B). The results demonstrated that Salmonella
can significantly decrease the expression of IDO and
AKT/mTOR signaling both in B16F10 and 4T1 cells.
To confirm whether AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
truly participates in a Salmonella-induced decrease of
IDO, cells were treated with autophagy inhibitor (an
inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)),
3-Methyladenine (3-MA). 3-MA could restore Salmonellainduced downregulation of IDO (Figure 3A and 3B).
Determination of the kynurenine expression assay showed
that treatment of tumor cells with 3-MA resulted in
inhibition of Salmonella-reduced kynurenine expression.
The production of kynurenine could also be reversed after
3-MA treatment (Figure 3C and 3D). However, adding
3-MA alone had little or even no effect on the expression
of IDO and kynurenine, indicating that the autophagy
signaling pathway might play the role in the Salmonellamediated decrease of IDO and related catabolic products.

RESULTS
Salmonella downregulated kynurenine and
enhanced the viability of T cells
It has been suggested that kynurenine has the ability
to increase T cell apoptosis [27]. As shown in Figure 1A
and 1B, Salmonella can decrease the production of
kynurenine in a dose-dependent manner in B16F10 and
4T1 cells. Kynurenine decreased significantly when cells
were treated with highest dose of Salmonella (multiplicity
of infection (MOI) = 100). Thus, we analyze whether

Salmonella reduced the expression of IDO

The constitutively active AKT was used to confirm our
findings. We found that Salmonella inhibited the expression

Salmonella regulated IDO expression
in vivo and inhibits tumor growth

of IDO by reducing AKT phosphorylation. The AKT/mTOR/
p70S6K signaling pathway was reversed by transfecting
constitutively active AKT plasmid. The suppressive effect of
Salmonella on the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway
was relieved by transfecting constitutively active AKT
plasmid in B16F10 (Figure 4A) and 4T1 (Figure 4B) cells.
By blocking the cascade of autophagy, the expression of IDO
in B16F10 cells treated with Salmonella and constitutively
AKT also reversed, implying that mTOR/AKT participates
in the Salmonella-regulated decrease of IDO. Transfection of
constitutively active AKT plasmid reduced the conversion of
LC3-I to LC3-II by Salmonella treatment in comparison with
vector only control transfection. The Salmonella-reduced
expression of IDO was also reduced after Salmonella
treatment by transfecting constitutively active AKT plasmid
(Figure 4A and 4B). Our results suggest that inhibition of
P-AKT is required for Salmonella-reduced expression of
IDO in tumor cells.

Tumor cells can create an immune escape
microenvironment to facilitate their growth by releasing
IDO themselves. Thus, analyzing the IDO expression
within a tumor region seems necessary. To verify our
findings in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were inoculated with
Salmonella 106 colony-forming units (cfu) and sacrificed
after 2 days. Tumor tissues were collected and analyzed
by immunoblotting assay. The results showed that as
the Salmonella treatment concentration increased, the
expression of IDO decreased (Figure 5A) as previously
described. The mean IDO expression for mice in the
Salmonella treatment group decreased by 54–78%
compared with those in the PBS-treated group. Salmonella
was able to decrease the production of IDO both in vitro
and in vivo. Furthermore, the antitumor effects of

marker and IDO were performed. The supernatants of B16F10 (C) or 4T1 (D) after treated with various multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
Salmonella were added to Jurkat cells (106) mixed with an equal amount of RPMI medium. After 3 days, cell were harvested and stained
with trypan blue. (n = 3, data are mean± SD. *p < 0.05).

Salmonella were evaluated in terms of tumor growth
of the mice bearing B16F10 or 4T1 tumors. As shown
in Figure 5C and 5D, tumor growth was significantly
decreased in mice treated with Salmonella compared to
PBS-treated control mice. The average tumor volume
in mice treated with Salmonella was lowered by 36%
(B16F10) and 68% (4T1) compared with mice treated with
PBS. To further examine whether Salmonella targeted the
tumor sites in mice bearing tumor, we injected Salmonella
into tumor bearing mice, and observed the bacterial
distribution within tumors. As shown in Figure  6A,
Salmonella predominantly resided in the tumor. The
number of apoptotic cells in the Salmonella-treated
group was significantly higher than in the PBS-treated
group (Figure  6B). Taken together, these results reveal

that systemic administration of Salmonella was capable
of inhibiting tumor growth and increasing the tumor cell
death.

Effective T cells infiltration increased due to
administration of Salmonella
The IDO-mediated tryptophan metabolic product
kynurenine has a huge impact on T cells, leading to
their inactivation, the inhibition of differentiation to
effective cells and even apoptosis. Figure 1C and 1D
indicate that Salmonella increased the likelihood of
T cell survival through downregulating kynurenine
production in vitro. The ability of IDO to induce T cell
apoptosis has been shown. Previous studies have also

DISCUSSION

suggested that Salmonella increases the infiltration
of immune cells and decreases the amount of IDO,
leading to T cell survival both in vitro and in vivo.
Hence, the relation between IDO and the infiltration
of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was analyzed. The
infiltration of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells within
the tumor region from B16F10 and 4T1 tumorbearing mice were analyzed by immunofluorescence
staining after treatment with PBS or Salmonella. The
results of immunofluorescence staining are shown in
Figure 7A. A notable increase of CD8+ T-cell infiltrates
in the tumors was observed in Salmonella–treated mice
(Figure 7B). As shown in Figure 7B, the CD4+ T cell
amount was not significantly higher in Salmonella–
treated mice than in PBS-treated mice in both strains
of mice. Taken together, these results indicate that
Salmonella increased infiltrating immune cells and cell
death in the tumors.

Immune tolerance has been a hall mark of cancer
and one of major barriers developing efficient anticancer
treatments. To overcome this hindrance, an effective
strategy to evoke host immunity against tumor cells
is necessary. Bacteria have a proven ability to inhibit
tumor growth; however, the detailed mechanism for
this still requires further investigation. Previous studies
have suggested that as a pathogen, Salmonella not only
summons host immune surveillance but can also quickly
accumulate within the tumor region, even leading to
tumor cell death [7]. Because of its strong properties of
activating immunity and killing cancer cells, we believe
that Salmonella are worth studying and applying to
anticancer treatments. The safety concerns for using
bacteria can be easily solved thanks to gene modification
or antibodies [28, 29]. However, this strain might exhibit

applied to clinical trial [30]. Researchers constructed
an amino acid auxotrophic strain of Salmonella and

found increased targeting and killing capacity with
less toxicity and distribution comparing to original
strain [31–40]. Moreover, the auxotrophic strain can be

effectively utilized as a treatment targeting several types
of cancer or metastatic region [43], and exhibit superior
ability of reducing tumor volume comparing to standard
chemotherapy [44, 45] . These researches revealed a great
promising way using genetically modified bacteria on
cancer therapy.
Autophagy is a way in which cells maintain
homeostasis and is considered an antitumor target [46],
especially the AKT/mTOR pathway, one of the wellstudied and targeted autophagy signaling pathways [47].
As mentioned previously, our studies have demonstrated
that Salmonella can cause autophagy of tumor cells,
ultimately leading to tumor cell death [22, 25]. Moreover,
evidence shows that autophagy might participate in
immune regulation [26]. Hence, we postulate that there
are connections between Salmonella, autophagy and
host immunity. We observed that the expression of
phosphorylated AKT, mTOR and p70S6K decreased in
Salmonella-infected tumor cells comparing to control

groups (Figure 2A and 2B). The relation between
autophagy and IDO was verified by using autophagy
inhibitor and constitutively-AKT plasmid. The inhibitor
and plasmid did not or slightly affect the expression of
IDO and kynurenine, but reverse the decrease in IDO and
kynurenine when cells were co-treated with Salmonella
(Figures 3 and 4), which indicates that AKT/mTOR
pathway might participate in Salmonella-mediated IDO
expression. Interestingly, another study inferred that
IDO can inhibit tryptophan-sufficiency signals triggering
autophagy through the mTOR pathway [48]. Salmonella
invasion results in the rapid induction of an acute state of
cytosolic amino acid (AA) starvation, provoked by host
membrane damage. Salmonella-induced AA starvation,
in turn, down-regulates AKT/mTOR signaling while
triggering autophagy and the integrated stress response
pathway [49]. Salmonella altered mTOR activity,
thereby impacting on host defense pathway. The AKT/
mTOR signaling pathways were found to be altered

during Salmonella infection [50]. Recently, we indeed
demonstrated that Salmonella inhibit the expression of
IDO in colorectal cancer [51]. There are some connection
between AKT/mTOR pathway and IDO. The underlying
and detail mechanism is worth studying.
We demonstrated that Salmonella can inhibit tumor
growth in tumor-bearing mice (Figure 5C and 5D),
and we investigated the possible mechanism causing
the regression. Salmonella-induced decreases of IDO
were seen both in vitro and in vivo. Figures 5A and 5B
reveal that the expression of IDO within tumor regions
can be downregulated by Salmonella. We verified these
findings through analysis of CD4 and CD8 positive cells.
Groups treated with Salmonella had a higher infiltration
of CD8 positive cells compared to controls (Figure 7).
This might be one of the explanations for why immune
cells infiltrate the tumor region after treatment with
Salmonella. Salmonella not only kills tumor cells by its
bacterial toxicity but also recruits and even effectively
activates host immune cells to attack; this might be a
good topic of future study or might help in developing
supporting treatments for patients who have impaired
immunity. Salmonella-reduced IDO expression is not
solely responsible for tumor immune tolerance. The
tumor microenvironment contains immunosuppressive
factors such as arginase, vascular endothelial growth
factor and TGF-β. Recently, we also observed that
Salmonella could inhibit the expression of programmed
cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) and programmed
cell death protein 1 ligand 2 (PDL2) in melanoma
cells. There are many other mechanisms by which
the antitumor T cell response is inhibited. Herein, we
provided one of possible mechanisms for Salmonella
antitumor activity. Once successfully evoked and
combined with other treatments, future Salmonellarelated treatments could shorten the treatment time and
reduce side effects. The bacteria strain employed here
has been utilized as a vector delivering DNA into mice
[52]. Using Salmonella combined with drugs capable of
reducing IDO and inhibiting tumor growth may be other
choice for immunotherapy one day. In future studies, a
further analysis of immune-related cytokines is needed,
which might provide a reference for monitoring tumors
or treatment progress after treatment with bacteria. In
addition, because we demonstrated that Salmonella can
break tumor immune tolerance, this might be another
aspect to consider for antitumor treatments, even the
application of bacteria to immunotherapy.

analysis of 30 inoperable cases treated by Coley’s mixed
toxins, in which diagnosis was confirmed by microscopic
examination selected for special study. Acta Med Scand
Suppl 1953; 276:1–103.

TUNEL assay and immunofluorescence staining
Cryostat sections (5mm) were prepared and fixed.
Tumor tissues were then processed in 5-μm sections and
stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E). The accumulation
of Salmonella within tumor region was described in
the previous study [57]. Cell apoptosis within tumor
region was analyzed by TUNEL assay according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI).
TUNEL-positive cells were counted under the microscope
in high-power field (HPF). The apoptosis index was
determined by the percentage of TUNEL-positive among
total cells of each sample [8]. To analyze the expression
of CD4 or CD8 positive cells within tumor region, tumor
cryostat sections were incubated with antibodies against
CD4 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and CD8 (BD
Biosciences). Slides were then incubated with fluorescein
(FITC) anti-rat IgG (H+L) for secondary antibody and
counter stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). The infiltrating cells were quantified by averaging
the number of each cell type in three areas of highest cell
density at x400 magnification in each section [8].
