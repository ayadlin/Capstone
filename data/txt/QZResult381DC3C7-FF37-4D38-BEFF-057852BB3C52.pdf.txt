BACKGROUND. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is among the
most feared side effects of cancer treatment. Poorly controlled CINV may lead to
additional office visits or emergency room admissions, thus increasing the overall
costs of cancer care. The objective of the project was to estimate the societal

costs of uncontrolled CINV among working-age cancer patients.

METHODS. The 1997–2002 Health and Productivity Management database, a proprietary database linking medical claims to work loss information, was used. The
study population consisted of employees or their spouses who were cancer
patients treated with highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens.
Costs of uncontrolled CINV were estimated by comparing the direct medical
costs and indirect costs between those with and without uncontrolled CINV; all
costs were normalized as monthly costs and updated to 2006 US dollars. The
Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the costs differences in univariate analyses, followed by multivariate analyses.

RESULTS. In all, 2018 patients were identified; 1771 (88%) received 5-HT3 receptor
antagonists, and uncontrolled CINV was found in 563 (28%). The estimated
monthly medical costs associated with uncontrolled CINV were approximately
$1300 higher for cancer patients at working ages. Subgroup analysis concluded
that indirect costs per patient per month were $433 higher for those in the
uncontrolled CINV group.

CONCLUSIONS. Despite a prevalent use of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, uncontrolled CINV remained a common and costly problem among cancer patients treated with highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Cancer

hemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is among
the most common and feared side effects reported by cancer
patients.1–3 The incidence of CINV ranges from less than 10% in
patients treated with chemotherapy agents with a low emetic risk to
between 30% and 90% among those whose regimens contain agents
with a high emetic risk.4,5 The introduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3-RAs), such as dolasetron (Anzemet),
granisetron (Kytril), and ondansetron (Zofran), in the early 1990s
made a substantial improvement in the clinical management of
CINV. Thus, earlier antiemetic guidelines recommended the use of
these first-generation 5-HT3-RAs for the treatment and prevention

of CINV.4,6 Further clinical improvement was
achieved with 2 antiemetic agents launched in
2003—palonosetron (Aloxi), a long-acting serotonin
antagonist,7–9 and aprepitant (Emend), a neurokinin1 antagonist.10,11 These 2 antiemetics are now
included in the most recent practice guidelines.12,13
Poorly controlled CINV was found to be associated with higher medical costs due to events such
as unscheduled office visits, needs for hydration, and
emergency room (ER) admissions.14–16 Most previous
economic studies of CINV compare the costs or costeffectiveness of a first-generation 5-HT3-RA with
antiemetics that were considered the standard of
care at the time of the study, such as prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.14,17–19 As the first-generation 5-HT3-RAs have become the standard of care for
CINV, it is important to update the economic studies
to reflect the paradigm shift in the prescription of
antiemetics after the mid-1990s. This update will
provide more accurate cost estimates to decisionmakers—estimates that take into consideration the
higher acquisition costs and superior clinical performance of the 5-HT3-RAs. Additionally, these
updated estimates will establish a new baseline for
future economic studies comparing newer classes of
antiemetics with the up-to-date standard of care for
CINV (ie, 5-HT3-RAs).
This study examined the economic impact of
poorly controlled CINV among working-age cancer
patients who were treated with highly or moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy in the late 1990s and early
2000s. Uncontrolled CINV among cancer patients in
this age group may exert an economic burden on
employees or their spouses. Specifically, employees
with uncontrolled CINV will incur medical costs and
indirect costs due to lost workdays. Additionally,
employees whose spouses suffer from uncontrolled
CINV will contribute to increases in medical costs if
the spouses are covered by the employees’ insurance.
We then used a hypothetical new antiemetic medication to explore the economic implication of prophylactic antiemetic use with new agents based on the
estimated costs of uncontrolled CINV.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
The primary data source used was the 1997–2002
Medstat MarketScan Health and Productivity Management (HPM) database, a large, nationwide,
employment-based database collected from approximately 45 large employers in the US and over 100
health insurance payers.20 The HPM data include
productivity information collected from the employ-

679

ers and claims data for employees and their spouse
or dependents enrolled in the health care plans provided by these employers. The productivity files
report information on 3 types of work leave: absence,
short-term disability, and workers’ compensation.
The claims data contain records of inpatient and
outpatient services and outpatient prescription
drugs. Additionally, the HPM data include enrollment
records. All files can be linked using de-identified
person identifiers.
This study was approved by the University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional
Review Board.

Study Population and Duration of Observation
The selected population included cancer patients
who received chemotherapy between January 1 1997
and December 31 2002 whose treatment regimen
contained 1 or more highly or moderately emetogenic agents. Cancer patients were identified using
the ICD-9 codes and chemotherapy drugs were identified using codes from the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and the Healthcare Common
Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). In addition,
antiemetics administered as injections were identified from the HCPCS codes in the inpatient and outpatient claims, and those administered orally from
the National Drug Codes (NDC) in the prescription
drug claims. The level of emetogeneity for each
chemotherapy agent was determined using the same
classification criteria reported in the 2004 Perugia
Antiemetic Guidelines.5,21 We defined the index date
as the first date that chemotherapy appeared in the
claims data and applied the following inclusion criteria: 18 years and older; having a continuous enrollment or a continuous record of claims for at least 3
months; and having a duration of chemotherapy
greater than 21 days.
The study duration was from the index date to
the last date of chemotherapy in the claims, 6
months after the index date, or the last date available
in our data (ie, December 31, 2002), whichever
occurred first. The study population was categorized
as patients with uncontrolled versus controlled CINV.
Patients were assigned to the ‘‘uncontrolled CINV’’
group if they had at least 1 office visit, ER visit, or
hospitalization with an ICD-9 diagnosis of nausea
and/or vomiting (780.0, 780.01, 780.02, 780.03) or
dehydration (276.5, 276.50) during the study period.16
Analysis of Direct Medical Costs
We compared the direct medical costs between
patients with controlled and uncontrolled CINV. It is

680

important to recognize that the observed cost differences between these 2 groups could be due to differences in chemotherapy costs or other side effects
that were disproportionately observed in the CINV
group. Therefore, we first categorized the total medical costs into 3 components: chemotherapy; treatments for costly chemotherapy-related adverse events
such as neutropenia, or the use of granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor (G-CSF) while excluding CINV; and
other interventions. We then used the cost difference
in the ‘‘others’’ category between groups to infer the
direct medical costs associated with uncontrolled
CINV. This approach has the advantage of minimizing biases in cost estimation due to unequal costs of
chemotherapy agents or side effects in the 2 groups.
Because medical costs were highly skewed,
Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney tests were performed to
compare the medical costs between groups in the
univariate analysis, and the logarithm transformation
of costs were used as the dependent variable in the
multivariate analyses. Covariates in the multivariate
analyses included patients’ demographics, geographic
characteristics, relationship with the employers
(employees or spouses of employees), clinical factors,
and time trends. Clinical factors included primary
cancer types, classified as breast, lung, gastrointestinal (GI), lymphoma, and other types, comorbidities,22,23 and tumor metastasis status. We obtained
the cost difference between patients in the controlled
and uncontrolled CINV groups by applying appropriate econometric technique (known as the smearing
estimate) to retransform the difference in log-transformed cost estimated in the regression model to the
original scale.24,25 All costs were updated to 2006 dollars using the medical care component of the consumer price index. Results are reported as cost per
patient per month by first aggregating costs from all
relevant medical claims throughout the study period
and then normalizing the aggregated amount to
monthly costs. Monthly costs were reported as this
measure approximates a cycle of chemotherapy.

Analysis of Indirect Costs (Exploratory
Subgroup Analysis)
The HPM data provide information of absence leave
for a subset of employees. As an exploratory analysis,
we used these employees to assess the indirect costs
of uncontrolled CINV; employees with short-term
disability claims during the entire study period were
excluded. We estimated the indirect costs by comparing the work-loss days between employees in the
uncontrolled and controlled CINV groups. We
imputed the indirect costs by multiplying hours lost

from work by the average hourly wage rate. Wage
rates were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and stratified by census regions to account for
geographic variations in wage structure.26 We inflated
the wage rates to 2006 dollars using the consumer
price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers.27 Analysis of indirect costs followed a similar analytical plan as in the direct medical costs. All Pvalues reported are 2-sided; statistical significance is
defined as P < .05.

Analysis of Economic Implication of Prophylactic Use of
Newer Antiemetics
Upon obtaining the estimated average per-patient
costs associated with uncontrolled CINV, we conducted a number of sensitivity analyses with a hypothetical new antiemetic medication to explore
whether prophylactic antiemetic use with the newer
agents can be justified economically. To determine
the economic implication of the hypothetical new
agent, we considered 3 factors in addition to the average cost of uncontrolled CINV: the rate of uncontrolled CINV (RCINV ) before the launch of this
hypothetical new agent, the effectiveness (E) of the
new agent in reducing such rate, and the price (P)
associated with a complete course of prophylactic
antiemetic administration with the new agent. We
denoted the costs of uncontrolled CINV as C and the
total number of patients treated with highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as N, prophylactic
use of this hypothetical new antiemetic would add
an additional (N 3 P) dollars to the health care system, but would reduce the rate of uncontrolled CINV
from RCINV to (RCINV 3 E). Therefore, if the savings
achieved from reducing the costs of uncontrolled
CINV outweighed the additional costs of this hypothetical new antiemetic, prophylactic use with this
new agent in clinical practice would be considered
economically justified. We performed threshold analyses to calculate the price of a complete course of
prophylactic use with the hypothetical new antiemetic at which the additional costs of prophylactic
use equaled the total savings from reduced costs of
uncontrolled CINV (ie, N 3 RCINV 3 E 3 C) and
named this price (denoted as P*) the ‘‘threshold
price.’’ Using the hypothetical new agent as prophylactic antiemetics could be justified economically if
the price of this new agent per course was lower
than the above calculated threshold price (ie, P \
P*). We then conducted sensitivity analyses under
various scenarios of prices, rates of uncontrolled
CINV, and clinical effectiveness to explore the economic feasibility of such practice pattern.

RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
In all, 2018 working-age cancer patients treated with
highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy were
identified. Descriptive statistics in Table 1 showed
that despite the prevalent use of the 5-HT3-RAs
(approximately 87%), 563 out of 2018 patients
(27.9%) experienced uncontrolled CINV. Table 1 also
shows significant differences in the geographic distribution (P 5 .0013) and cancer types (P < .0001)
between the controlled and uncontrolled CINV
groups and a significantly higher proportion of 5HT3-RAs use in the uncontrolled group (92.5% vs
85.9%, P < .0001).
Analysis of Direct Medical Costs
Our univariate analysis showed that the total direct
medical costs per patient per month for the uncontrolled CINV group were $1797 (5 $10,720 2 $8923)
higher than that for the controlled CINV group

the difference in monthly costs reduced to $1383
(P < .0001).

CINV indicates chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; GI, gastrointestinal.
Coefficients greater than 0 indicate a positive correlation between the factor and cost; coefficients
less than 0 indicate a negative correlation.

Table 3 presents the results from the regression
analysis with log(cost) as the dependent variable. For
ease of interpretation, we converted the regression
coefficients to percentages28; for example, it shows
that on average the monthly medical cost of patients
in the uncontrolled CINV group was 29.79% (5 100*
(exp(0.261) 2 1)) higher than that of patients in
the controlled CINV group, after controlling for
confounding factors such as demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics. After retransformation, this magnitude of difference in logtransformed cost was equivalent to approximately
$1280.

Exploratory Subgroup Analysis
In all, 94 employees met our inclusion criterion for
analyses of indirect costs described above; 30 of the
94 (31.9%) patients had uncontrolled CINV. The average number of work-loss days for uncontrolled and
controlled CINV groups was 6.23 and 3.61 days per
month (P 5 .120). We also found that employees in
the uncontrolled CINV group were more likely to
take a leave of absence, although the difference was
not statistically significant (60.0% vs 45.3%, P 5 .184).
After adjusting for demographic and clinical charac-

teristics, we found that on average the total, direct,
and indirect costs of patients experiencing uncontrolled CINV were $1832 (P 5 .047), $1399 (P 5 .126),
and $433 (P 5 .102) higher than those who did not
experience uncontrolled CINV. Note that P-values in
this sample should be interpreted with caution, as
the sample size is underpowered to detect statistically significant differences between patients in the
controlled and uncontrolled CINV groups.

Economic Feasibility of Prophylactic Antiemetic
Use With a New Agent
Using the adjusted costs of uncontrolled CINV (ie,
$1280) estimated above, our sensitivity analyses varied the rate of uncontrolled CINV from 0% to 90% at
10% intervals and considered 4 levels of effectiveness, ranging from a 20% reduction at the rate of
uncontrolled CINV to 100%. The threshold price corresponding to each level of uncontrolled CINV in the
absence of our hypothetical new agent in combination of the clinical effectiveness of the agent is presented in Figure 1; these prices represented the
maximum dollar value of a complete course of prophylactic use with the hypothetical new antiemetic
that can be sustained by the health care system economically under various scenarios. For example, if
the rate of uncontrolled CINV before the launch of
the hypothetical new antiemetic was 30%, and the
new agent was expected to reduce the rate by 80%,
then prophylactic use of this antiemetic was economically beneficial if the price of a complete course
of prophylactic antiemetic use was lower than $307.
Figure 1 shows a clear trend of increasing threshold
prices as the rate of uncontrolled CINV or the effectiveness of the hypothetical new agent increases.

DISCUSSION
This study estimated costs associated with uncontrolled CINV among working-age cancer patients in
an era when the use of the first-generation 5-HT3RAs has become the standard of care for the prevention and treatment of CINV. Despite this major
improvement in supportive care, there is still much
room for improvement. The estimated additional
direct medical costs per patient per month due to
uncontrolled CINV was close to $1300, or 30% higher
than those in the controlled CINV group.
Despite a high compliance with the antiemetic
guidelines that recommend the use of 5-HT3-RAs,
several studies reported that cancer patients still
experienced CINV and that the problem seemed to be
worse in delayed CINV.29–31 Grunberg et al.31 reported
that 13% and 37% of cancer patients receiving moder-

ately emetogenic chemotherapy experienced acute
nausea and vomiting, respectively. For patients
experiencing delayed CINV, the percentages increased
to 28% and 52%, respectively. The rate of delayed
CINV is even higher among patients whose chemotherapy regimens contain 1 or more highly emetogenic agent, such as cisplatin. Kris et al.32 reported a
38% and 61% rate of acute and delayed CINV, respectively, among patients treated with cisplatin and
received metoclopramide and dexamethasone at the
time of chemotherapy administration. Vanscoy
et al.16 found that among cancer patients treated with
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and given prophylactic 5-HT3-RAs, 11.1% reported extreme CINV
events, defined as having 1 or more unscheduled visits or calls to the oncology practice for management
of failed CINV prophylaxis. Our findings are comparable to previous research; we found that, whereas close
to 90% of our study sample received 5-HT3-RAs, 28%
still experienced uncontrolled CINV.
Our analysis was based on claims data from
1997 to 2002, a time during which the newer antie-

metics such as palonosetron and aprepitant were not
yet available. It is possible that some of the higher
acquisition costs of these new agents can be offset
by cost savings achieved from reducing the rate of
uncontrolled CINV, especially from delayed CINV.
The threshold prices calculated in our sensitivity
analyses using a hypothetical new agent provide
some insights as to the economic implications of
these new agents that may inform clinical choices. If
the rate of uncontrolled CINV before the administration of any new agent is 30% and that the new agent
can reduce the rate of uncontrolled CINV by 80% (ie,
from 30% to 6%), our study suggests that an antiemetic regimen that increases the antiemetic costs by
$307 or less is likely to reduce the overall costs. Or,
similarly, if the rate is 50% and the new antiemetic
can reduce it to 10% (ie, 80% effectiveness), our
study suggests that an antiemetic regimen that
increases the costs by $512 or less would save
money.
We were able to obtain absence records for a
small group of employees in our data. To explore

684

CANCER

whether this subgroup of patients and the full sample have similar characteristics, we compared patient
characteristics between these 2 samples and found
that these 2 samples were similar in general, with
exceptions in the distribution of gender, geographic
location, and time trend. The higher proportion of
patients in the subgroup observed in year 2000 and
2001 could probably explain the slightly higher cost
difference in direct medical costs found in the subgroup ($1399 vs $1280), as a positive association
between medical costs and time trend was indicated
in the full sample analysis (Table 3). After adjusting
for demographic and clinical characteristics, our exploratory analysis concluded that productivity loss
($433) accounted for approximately 24% of the total
cost difference ($1832) between the uncontrolled and
controlled CINV groups. Assessing productivity loss
for conditions such as uncontrolled CINV that arise
from a major medical treatment is challenging. First,
one cannot evaluate productivity loss for uncontrolled CINV for patients who are on short-term disability leave because the absence records are not
meaningful for such employees. Even cancer patients
who stay active in the labor force may exhaust all
their work leave due to frequent medical office visits
for confirmatory diagnoses, evaluations, and chemotherapy. It is possible that employers allow these
employees to work at a lesser capacity (eg, switching
to part-time), or simply to take days off when necessary and make up for the hours later. Either scenario
will fail to generate a recorded day of absence from
work, even though productivity losses had actually
occurred. The HPM data do not provide the information that would allow us to differentiate various scenarios; consequently, the indirect costs reported in
our study may be underestimated.
This study focused on working-age cancer
patients because cancer in young adult patients is often treated more aggressively; therefore, the likelihood of observing a higher cost of uncontrolled CINV
is greater in young adults. Additionally, the selection
of this population allowed us to have more comprehensive evaluations of the economic burden, by
including direct and indirect costs. Whether the
results of our study can be generalized to elderly cancer patients is yet to be determined. Factors such as a
smaller proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy or a larger proportion of patients receiving
agents with low emetic properties may lead to a lower
cost of uncontrolled CINV in the elderly population
than that estimated from our study. On the other
hand, uncontrolled CINV may have more severe
health consequences among elderly cancer patients
and thus result in higher costs in this population.

Our study was constrained by information collected in claims data. For example, we were not able
to differentiate between uncontrolled, acute and
delayed CINV. The distinction between the 2 types of
emesis would have provided additional information
on the source of the economic benefit one can
expect from the newer antiemetics. A recent metaanalysis concluded that the use of the first-generation 5-HT3-RAs beyond 24 hours after chemotherapy
for prevention of delayed emesis was not supported
by clinical or economic evidence.33 Because the
newer antiemetics have demonstrated superior clinical performance in reducing delayed emesis, some of
the higher acquisition costs of these drugs may be
offset by cost savings achieved from lowering the
rate of uncontrolled, delayed CINV. Consequently,
economic evidence may support using the newer
agents to prevent delayed emesis. Unfortunately, limited clinical information available in claims data precluded such comparison. Furthermore, our estimates
of indirect cost and total costs were derived from a
small subset of patients whose absence records were
available. Due to the limited power provided in this
sample, results from the subgroup analysis of indirect costs should be viewed as exploratory and should
be confirmed with a larger sample in future studies.
