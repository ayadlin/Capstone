Abstract
The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein drives tumorigenesis in subsets
of several tumors through chromosomal rearrangements that express and activate its
C-terminal kinase domain. In addition, germline predisposition alleles and acquired
mutations are found in the full-length protein in the pediatric tumor neuroblastoma.
ALK-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become important new drugs for
ALK-driven lung cancer, but acquired resistance via multiple mechanisms including
kinase-domain mutations eventually develops, limiting median progression-free survival
to less than a year. Here we assess the impact of several kinase-domain mutations that
arose during TKI resistance selections of ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL)
cell lines. These include novel variants with respect to ALK-fusion cancers, R1192P and
T1151M, and with respect to ALCL, F1174L and I1171S. We assess the effects of these
mutations on the activity of six clinical inhibitors in independent systems engineered
to depend on either the ALCL fusion kinase NPM-ALK or the lung-cancer fusion kinase
EML4-ALK. Our results inform treatment strategies with a likelihood of bypassing
mutations when detected in resistant patient samples and highlight differences between
the effects of particular mutations on the two ALK fusions.

Introduction

debate [3–6]. Germline and acquired mutations in wildtype ALK, however, are found in the childhood cancer
neuroblastoma [7–10]. Furthermore, chromosomal
rearrangements fusing ALK’s C-terminal kinase domain
to a number of constitutively expressed genes result in
malignant transformation through activation of multiple
oncogenic signaling pathways [11, 12].
In NPM-ALK, identified in 1994 [13], ALK is fused
to the constitutively expressed nucleophosmin gene [14].
Approximately 70% of anaplastic large cell lymphomas

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) [1] is an
important therapeutic target in cancer, despite the function
of the wild-type protein being poorly understood. While
having key roles in early nervous system development [2],
the levels of wild-type ALK subsequently drop off
and remain at low levels for the remainder of life.

ligand(s) responsible for its activation are still up for

ALK expression each line still exhibited varying degrees
of persistent TKI resistance. Sequencing of the ALK TKD
by Sanger and deep sequencing methods had suggested
second-site mutations could be driving resistance, but we
did not further characterize these initial findings. For this
report, we maintained resistant clones in their top TKI
concentration and then twice repeated Sanger sequencing
of cDNA amplified from NPM-ALK mRNA. This detected
a single second-site mutation in each resistant sub-clone
(Figure 1B). Two of the mutations (I1171S from SUPCR500-2 and F1174L from SUP-LR-2) were present as
single peaks in the sequencing, indicating homogeneous
populations in the sub-clones following drug selections.
The other three mutations (R1192P from DHL1-CR500,
T1151M from DHL-LR150, and G1269A from DHL1CR500-2) appeared together with underlying wild-type
peaks, indicating heterogeneous cell populations. While
some of these mutations have been observed previously
in the context of ALK-fusion cancers, we characterize two
novel mutations that thus far have only been observed in
neuroblastoma – T1151M and R1192P – and two mutations
not previously characterized in ALK+ ALCL (Table 1).
Each mutation was modeled on an X-ray structure of the
ALK kinase domain (Figure 1C; discussed further below).
We first compared each subclone to its respective
parent line for sensitivity to the TKI in which it had been
selected (Figure 2A; Table 2). In all cases, subclones
were significantly less sensitive, as determined by
a highly significant increase in IC50, but additional
factors could have arisen during selections to promote
resistance. Furthermore, three of the five mutations
were present in heterogeneous populations of cells also
containing the wild-type NPM-ALK (as discussed above;
Figure 1B). Therefore, to isolate the specific effect of
each identified ALK-kinase mutation, we employed IL3dependent FL5.12 murine pro-B cells as an independent
system [32]. We generated each mutation through sitedirected mutagenesis in NPM-ALK cloned into a GFP coexpressing MSCV-based vector (Supplementary Figure
S1). Retroviral introduction of wild-type NPM-ALK or
mutants, followed by IL3 withdrawal, transformed the
FL5.12 cells from cytokine-dependence to oncogenedependence (Figure 2B). Transformed lines withdrawn
from IL3 proliferate only as 100% GFP+ clones, and
dependence on NPM-ALK is further demonstrated by the
failure of kinase-dead NPM-ALK or empty vector (not
shown) to permit cytokine-independent growth. We then
assessed sensitivity of lines transformed by each mutant to
six TKIs in comparison to those transformed by wild-type
NPM-ALK (Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure S2; Table
3). All five mutations exhibited significant cross-resistance
to the three approved inhibitors, crizotinib, ceritinib, and
alectinib. The two mutations derived from lines that had
been selected in the second-generation inhibitor ceritinib,
T1151M and F1174L, were pan-resistant to all five TKIs,
though degree of resistance varied (discussed below).

(ALCL) are positive for this or similar fusions [15]. In
fact, it was through the discovery of this fusion that ALK
was originally cloned [13]. Subsequently, in 2007, ALK
was found fused to echinoderm microtubule associated
protein-like 4 (EML4) yielding the fusion kinase EML4ALK seen in approximately 3–5% of non-small cell lung
cancers (NSCLC) [16, 17]. Several other ALK fusions
since have been identified, including the RANBP2 (RNA
binding protein 2)-ALK fusion seen in inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor (IMT, reviewed in [14]).
Since the highly successful use of imatinib and
other BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against
chronic myeloid leukemia [18], there have been great
efforts to find inhibitors that turn off other such kinases
[19]. In 2011, a mere four years after the discovery of
EML4-ALK, the U.S. FDA approved the dual ALK/
MET TKI crizotinib for ALK+ NSCLC. While initial
response to crizotinib may be strong [20–24], patients
inevitably succumb due to acquired resistance through
multiple mechanisms, including kinase-domain mutations,
prompting development of newer generation inhibitors
(Table 1).
Here we assess the resistance/sensitivity profiles
of mutations that arose in patient derived-cell ALCL
lines continually exposed to either crizotinib or the 2nd
generation ALK/IGF-1R inhibitor ceritinib (LDK378;
FDA approved in 2014 for treating ALK+ NSCLC patients
who failed crizotinib) [25]. Each mutation was profiled
against six ALK TKIs – crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib
(which recently received FDA approval for treating ALK+
NSCLC patients who failed crizotinib [26]), AP26113
(brigatinib; a dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor in phase I/II trials
that received FDA breakthrough therapy designation
in 2014 [19]), ASP3026 (an ALK TKI in phase I trials
[27, 28]) and AZD3463 (a dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor in
preclinical development) [19, 29, 30].

Results
The ALK+ ALCL cell lines SUP-M2 and SUDHL-1, which are highly sensitive to ALK inhibition
(Figure 1A), were selected in increasing concentrations
of either crizotinib or ceritinib to investigate mechanisms
of acquired resistance. We previously showed resistance
initially was caused by increased NPM-ALK expression
in all of these selections, and that this ALK up-regulation
induced TKI-dependency as drug withdrawal resulted
in the death of resistant cells [31]. Individual subclones,
however, were able to grow again without ALK inhibitor
following prolonged passaging, leading to normalization
of NPM-ALK expression. These lines were named after
their respective parent lines (SUP or DHL1), the inhibitor
they were grown in (CR for crizotinib resistance, LR for
ceritinib (LDK378) resistance), and the top nanomolar
concentration in which they were able to proliferate
during selection. Despite restoration of baseline NPMwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

*Seen by ultra-deep sequencing at low frequency.
The other three mutations, from crizotinib-selected
lines, remained sensitive to at least one other inhibitor.
This independent system demonstrates resistance in
ALK+ ALCL lines is driven at least in part by acquired
ALK kinase-domain mutations, and confirms previous
observations that mutations arising in response to one drug
may affect multiple inhibitors of the same target.
To further identify the potential clinical implications
of each mutation, and to assess whether the effects of each
mutation are fusion-specific, we employed an additional
in vitro model. Each mutation was generated via sitedirected mutagenesis in EML4-ALK, the most common
ALK fusion detected in NSCLC, and cloned into the
same GFP-expressing MSCV-based vector backbone
described above (Supplementary Figure S3). Once again,
using FL5.12 murine pro-B cells, retroviral introduction
of each EML4-ALK mutant construct and subsequent IL3
withdrawal resulted in cytokine-independent, oncogenedependent cellular transformation (Figure 2D). The
resistance/sensitivity profiles of each EML4-ALK mutant
versus wild-type EML4-ALK to the same panel of TKIs
were assessed in the same manner as above (Figure
2E; Supplementary Figure S4; Table 4). For mutations
previously observed in ALK TKI resistance models, our
results were largely consistent with individual findings
reported by others (Table 1). We observed some important
differences, however, between the effects of particular
mutations on NPM-ALK vs. EML4-ALK (compare
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Figure 2E and Figure 2C). In particular, R1192P and
T1151M – never before detected in resistant EML4-ALKdriven cell lines or patient samples – had substantially
greater effect on NPM-ALK in promoting resistance than
on EML4-ALK. These findings among others highlight
potentially clinically important differences mediated by
ALK’s fusion partner affecting selection by tumors for
particular mutations (see discussion).
We next assessed through immunoblotting the
signaling consequences in FL5.12 cells of NPM-ALKR1192P and T1151M, the two mutations not previously
described as fusion ALK-kinase resistance mutations
(Figure 3). Results suggest a particularly strong resistance
phenotype of R1192P to all the inhibitors except AP26113,
in line with the IC50 data. The effect of T1151M,
meanwhile, was weaker, with higher concentrations of
all drugs except ASP3026 overcoming its effects on ALK
phosphorylation. We note that pERK levels decreased in
crizotinib-treated FL5.12 cells not transfected with NPMALK (growing in IL3), and pERK is correspondingly
more crizotinib sensitive in all the transformed lines as
well. This suggests an off-target effect such as this drug’s
known activity against MET [33]. Similar to our published
findings, phosphorylation of ERK and AKT were overall
variable in these results, providing inconsistent markers of
drug potency [31]. STAT3 activation, however, (indicated
by phosphorylation at Y705), which is known to be ALCL’s
core survival pathway was strongly consistent with drug

NPM-ALK up-regulation, which also paradoxically drives
dependence on continued inhibitor exposure, defining for
the first time oncogene overdose by ALK over-activation
[31]. Here, we examine five NPM-ALK kinase domain
mutations that drive resistance in ALCL in an absence
of over-expression. Two of these, R1192P and T1151M,
are previously unreported as ALK TKI resistance
mutations. We evaluated mutations in an independent
system permitting isolation of mutation effect from other
factors that may arise in ALK-dependent cells continually
exposed to inhibitors. These experiments showed R1192P,
T1151M, and the other mutations in NPM-ALK adversely

potency and ALK phosphorylation status [34, 35]. We
therefore confirm drug-resistant ALK activation promoting
ALCL’s core survival pathway mediated by NPM-ALKR1192P and T1151M, consistent with viability data.

Discussion
Resistance to ALK-kinase inhibition in lung cancer
is described in several published studies that employed
cell lines, patient samples, or both. Our goal has been
to understand resistance in ALK+ ALCL, which is less
well studied. We previously reported resistance driven by

affected the activity of multiple ALK TKIs but also pointed
to inhibitors for which sensitivity is maintained or even
enhanced. Interestingly, cross-validation using the lung
cancer-derived EML4-ALK fusion showed both similarities
and key differences in the effect of mutations on particular
drugs. Our study therefore characterizes novel NPMALK TKI resistance mutations, providing guidance for
appropriate choice of alternate therapies as more of these
drugs move toward regulatory approval. It also highlights
key differences in the effect of mutations on the ALK
kinase domain’s sensitivity to inhibition depending on
its fusion partner. For example, the fact that R1192P and
T1151M have not previously been detected in resistant
EML4-ALK-driven systems is not surprising since their
effect on drug activity was significantly less for that kinase
than for NPM-ALK. The profile of ALK TKI resistance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutations likely to arise in a tumor, therefore, is inherently
shaped by ALK’s fusion partner, as should choices of
alternative therapy.

I1171S
I1171S previously was seen in an in vitro accelerated
mutagenesis screen in ALK+ NSCLC using increasing
concentrations of crizotinib [36] and somatic mutations
in this residue also have been reported in neuroblastoma
[10, 37]. Subsequently, this mutation was identified in an
ALK+ NSCLC patient as conferring alectinib resistance
[38]. Consistent with its original identification in
EML4-ALK-driven systems, we find I1171S is potently
resistance-conferring to FL5.12 cells dependent on this
fusion. All six TKIs tested had significantly increased
23720

Oncotarget

IC50s when tested vs. EML4-ALK-I117S compared to
wild-type (Figure 2E). In NPM-ALK, I1171S promoted
resistance to crizotinib, the drug used in selecting the line
in which it was isolated, ceritinib, and again pronounced
resistance to alectinib. Ultra-deep sequencing previously
identified I1171S at very low frequencies as a candidate
ASP3026-resistant mutation in ALK+ ALCL [39], which
is also confirmed in our functional system. Interestingly,

however, NPM-ALK-I1171S promoted no resistance,
indeed increased sensitivity compared to wild type, to
both AP26113 and AZD3463. The effect of a resistance
mutation conferring sensitivity to other inhibitors is similar
to a recent high-profile case report in which the L1198F
mutation, providing resistance to the third-generation
inhibitor lorlatinib, resulted in resensitization to crizotinib
[40]. The novel finding in our study is that this effect was

seen for NPM-ALK but not EML4-ALK. Our data do not
identify the reason for differential the effects of I1171S on
AP26113 and AZD3463 (structurally similar compounds
that also inhibit EGFR) between NPM-ALK and EML4ALK. Given the FL5.12 system used is identical in
all ways other than ALK’s fusion partner, the effect is
likely on-target, mediated by subtle ATP binding-pocket
differences between the two fusion kinases.
Several other amino acid substitutions occur at
I1171 residue, all promoting resistance to both crizotinib
and alectinib regardless of whether their characterization
was in the context of NSCLC or ALCL (Table 1)
[39, 41–46]. There are some differences in TKI resistance
between our findings for I1171S and other amino acid
substitutions at this residue. For instance, in lymphoma
studies, I1171N and I1171T are reported to be AP26113resistant [39, 41], and while both appear resistant to
ceritinib in NPM-ALK [39, 41], they show sensitivity in
EML4-ALK [43, 44, 47, 48]. Further variability exists for

both I1171N and I1171T, with the former being ASP3026sensitive [39, 42] and the latter resistant [39] in NPM-ALK.
I1171 is part of the hydrophobic regulatory spine
(R-spine), along with residues C1182, F1271 (DFG
motif), H1247 (HRD motif) and D1311 (F-helix),
which connects the two major ALK TKD lobes.
Mutations in I1171 are believed to lock ALK in its
active conformation, accelerating its activation through
autophosphorylation [37, 43, 49–52]. Additionally,
mutations at this residue decrease stability of inhibitor
binding at the DFG motif, and, in the case of at least
I1171N, modify the structure of the kinase-inhibitor
complex [41]. Our data suggest NPM-ALK+ ALCL
patients who develop resistance due to I1171S could
benefit from treatment using either AP26113 or
AZD3463, as both overcome this mutation in our
independent system. Other inhibitors may be necessary
in the context of EML4-ALK.

same model [39]. Additionally, while we observe a small
fold-increase in the IC50 for AP26113 (1.4-fold) for this
mutant compared to wild-type NPM-ALK, the increase
is not statistically significant (p = 0.0513), and AP26113
has been reported to show sensitivity to both F1174V and
F1174I [39, 60]. Our data for both fusions, in agreement
with other studies in NPM-ALK, show ASP2036 is unable
to overcome any amino acid substitutions at this location
[39, 60]. Furthermore, while AP26113 may show slight
efficacy in overcoming ALK+ ALCL resistance acquired
by this mutation (p = 0.0513), it is predicted to be
ineffective in ALK+ NSCLC, with the opposite being true
for AZD3463 with respect to each disease. This further
highlights the care required when considering treatment
options to overcome resistance in patients, as both the
specific substitution and the particular ALK-fusion may
be key factors.

The phenylalanine residue at position 1174, located
at the end of the αC helix amongst a highly hydrophobic
cluster of residues, maintains autoinhibitory interactions
when ALK is in its inactive conformation [37, 49, 51] and
is a mutational hotspot within the ALK kinase domain
[53]. We found F1174L in a cell line grown in increasing
concentrations of ceritinib. It is a frequent somatic
mutation in neuroblastoma and increases ALK’s affinity
for ATP, despite not directly contacting the ATP pocket.
Accordingly, resistance is not due to steric hindrance
of drug binding, but rather promotion of ALK’s active
conformation indicated by accelerated autophosphorylation
[10, 37, 54]. F1174L therefore acts as both a TKI-resistance
and an activating mutation [7–10, 37, 54]. In agreement
with our observations for NPM-ALK (Table 1; Figure 2C;
Supplementary Figure S2), F1174L results in resistance
to crizotinib in both ALK+ NSCLC and ALK+ IMT
[55–57], although we did not observe a significant change
in resistance in our EML4-ALK in vitro assay ( p = 0.4846;
Table 4; Figure 2E; Supplementary Figure S4). In contrast
to previous reports in ALK+ NSCLC [56–58] along with
our EML4-ALK in vitro assay, we observe resistance to
alectinib, which is more in agreement with this mutation
favoring ATP binding over inhibitor binding, and suggests
potential differences in the conformational changes
induced by a leucine substitution at this residue based
on ALK’s fusion partner. Studies involving other amino
acid substitutions at position 1174 support this. Whereas
F1174C and F1174V are resistant to crizotinib and ceritinib
in ALK+ NSCLC cell line models and patient samples
[36, 47, 59], F1174V and F1174I are sensitive to both TKIs
in ALK+ ALCL [39, 60].
Furthermore, despite F1174C and F1174V showing
resistance to alectinib in ALK+ ALCL [46, 60], this drug
is able to overcome an isoleucine substitution in the

R1192P
The R1192P mutation, residing in the N-lobe,
is one of the most frequent germline mutations in
neuroblastoma [10]. In a similar fashion to both I1171
and F1174 mutations, R1192P results in accelerated
autophosphorylation of ALK’s TKD [37]. In fact, this
mutation is considered an exception, as most residues
in the N-lobe have smaller impacts. We report here for
the first time the identification of this mutation in any
ALK-fusion cancer, in a cell line selected in crizotinib.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, due to its ability to strongly
turn on the kinase activity of ALK, all but one TKI
proved to be ineffective at overcoming resistance to
this mutation in NPM-ALK (Table 1; Figures 2C, 2D
and 3; Supplementary Figure S2). The only exception,
AP26113, may be an attractive therapeutic in the event
of resistance by this mutation. The effect of this mutation
was dramatically less vs. all drugs when it was introduced

instead to EML4-ALK, likely explaining, as discussed
above, why it has never been reported in resistant ALK+
lung cancer. Detailed structural determinations are outside
the scope of this report, but it is interesting to note that
all three mutations reported to activate ALK kinase rather
than block drug binding to the ATP pocket – F1174L,
R1192P, and T1151M (below) – have greater effect on
drug activity when found in NPM-ALK than in EML4ALK. Follow-up structural chemistry studies to this report
may confirm and identify the basis for this effect.

contact with crizotinib. Using computer modeling
(Figure 1C), we observed that the dichlorofluorophenyl
ring of crizotinib binds near G1269 (distance 3.49
Å between Ca G1269 and fluorine atom). G1269A
causes a steric clash between the dichlorofluorophenyl
ring and the alanine’s methyl group, apparently
sufficient to disrupt the drug’s activities [47, 63, 65].
Much like T1151 mutations, G1269 mutations cause
modest constitutive ALK tyrosine kinase activity [37].
While we observed resistance to ceritinib in both
fusions (Table 1; Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure S2),
others have shown that ceritinib effectively overcomes
G1269A in both ALK+ NSCLC [25, 47] and ALK+ ALCL
[64] due to it stabilizing ALK’s conformational dynamics
and exhibiting increased potency for this mutant over WT
ALK [48]. Once again, the degree of resistance in our
study was only mild (1.35-fold for NPM-ALK and 1.52fold for EML4-ALK), albeit still statistically significant
( p = 0.0018 and < 0.0001, respectively), which may
explain this difference. Another discrepancy is with
ASP3026, predicted to overcome resistance in NPMALK by our data but unable to do so in a separate study in
both ALK+ NSCLC and ALK+ ALCL [64]. However, the
sensitivity reported in our study is just barely significant
( p = 0.0495), perhaps explaining this discrepancy.
Additionally, while we and Fontana and colleagues [64]
report that alectinib is unable to overcome G1269A in
the context of either disease, two other studies showed
a response to alectinib in vitro, in xenograft models, and
in a patient harboring this mutation [58, 66]. Borderline
results in vitro may therefore be less reliable predictors of
responses in vivo. Indeed, others have shown some TKIs
with IC50 shifts in vitro may still cause tumor regression
in vivo [47]. Further trial and error, including studies in
resistant patients, will be necessary to clarify the situation
for some mutations. Our data suggest AZD3463 may be
able to overcome G1269A in both fusion-cancers. Both
ASP3026 and AZD3463 interact differently compared
to crizotinib with the active site near G1269. The X-ray
crystal structure of ASP3026 with the ALK kinase domain
(PDB code: 2XB7) shows that the isopropylsulfone group
interacts with lysine 1150 through hydrogen bonding.
This bond draws ASP3026’s binding away from G1269
(distance = 5.85 Å between G1269 Ca and methylene
carbon), and it is expected that ASP3026 would bind
G1269A mutant in similar fashion.
The ALK kinase has several mutational hotspots,
such as F1174, F1245 and R1275 [53]. The identification
of two mutations not previously reported in any
malignancy driven by an ALK-fusion (T1151M and
R1192P) is therefore highly informative. Despite a
predilection for certain mutations conferring resistance,
“novel” mutations at sites other than mutational hotspots
can still occur, perhaps albeit at lower frequencies, as
the tumor evolves in a desperate attempt to evade death.
Our findings with mutations favoring ATP-binding

T1151M
T1151M was identified recently in neuroblastoma
patients [37] and we present here the first report of this
mutation in the ALK-fusion context, arising in a cell line
grown in ceritinib. An amino acid insertion, 1151Tins is
well-characterized as causing cross-resistance to several
ALK TKIs in ALK+ NSCLC cell lines and patients
[25, 47, 61], although one study reports that alectinib
is effective against it [58]. Additionally, 1151Tins was
reported in neuroblastoma [62]. Finally, the amino acid
substitution T1151K was also found in an accelerated
mutagenesis screen in ALK+ NSCLC assessing crizotinib
resistance [36].
Mutations at residue 1151, located at the N-terminal
lobe of the ALK catalytic domain, alter affinity of the
mutated kinase for ATP, and diminish inhibitor binding
through conformational changes, despite lying some
distance from the ATP pocket [47, 61]. Furthermore,
mutations in this domain lead to activation of the ALK
TKD, albeit more modestly than I1171, F1174, or R1192
[37]. It is therefore perhaps unsurprising that 1151Tins,
T1151K, or, in our case, T1151M in NPM-ALK, cause
cross-resistance to several ALK TKIs due to the mutant
kinase domain strongly favoring ATP binding, as confirmed
by fold-changes in IC50 and western blotting (Table 1;
Figure 2C and 2D; Supplementary Figure S2). Somewhat
surprising is the lack of significant change in response
to AP26113 ( p = 0.2090) and sensitivity to alectinib
( p = 0.0169; in agreement with Kodama et al [58] as
mentioned above) when compared to wild-type EML4ALK, further highlighted the importance of the particular
amino acid substitution, as well as the potential differences
in protein folding dependent upon the fusion partner in
question.

G1269A
In agreement with our observations, this mutation
resists crizotinib in both NPM-ALK (as expected as
it was isolated from a cell line grown in crizotinib)
and EML4-ALK, but is sensitive to AP26113 in both
fusions [47, 63, 64]. A serine substitution at the same
residue behaves similarly in EML4-ALK [36, 55].
G1269 lies in the ATP-binding pocket, making direct

and dampening inhibitor-binding and/or constitutively
activating ALK’s TKD, suggest newer competitive
inhibitors are desperately needed to overcome acquired
resistance. One such inhibitor, the first 3rd generation
ALK (and ROS1) inhibitor PF-06463922 (lorlatinib),
exhibits increased potency against F1174L, 1151Tins,
I1171T and G1269A in preclinical EML4-ALK models
[67, 68], with impressive anti-tumour activity observed in
xenograft neuroblastoma models harboring F1174L [53].
Another new inhibitor, a structural analog of alectinib, JHVIII-157-02, also shows great promise against a series of
ALK resistance mutations, including G1269A, F1174L
and 1151Tins [69]. Further development and screening of
newer generation ALK inhibitors is highly important in
overcoming resistance mutations in patients suffering from
ALK-related malignancies.
