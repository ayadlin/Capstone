Antiproliferative Effect of Octreotide in a Neuroendocrine
Tumor Model: Implications for Dose Optimization

Abstract
Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) are highly expressed in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET).
Octreotide, an SSTR agonist, has been used to suppress the production of vasoactive hormones and relieve
symptoms of hormone hypersecretion with functional NETs. In a clinical trial, an empiric dose of octreotide
treatment prolonged time to tumor progression in patients with small bowel neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors,
irrespective of symptom status. However, there has yet to be a dose optimization study across the patient
population, and methods are currently lacking to optimize dosing of octreotide therapy on an individual basis.
Multiple factors such as total tumor burden, receptor expression levels, and nontarget organ metabolism/
excretion may contribute to a variation in SSTR octreotide occupancy with a given dose among different patients.
In this study, we report the development of an imaging method to measure surface SSTR expression and
occupancy level using the PET radiotracer 68Ga-DOTATOC. In an animal model, SSTR occupancy by octreotide
was assessed quantitatively with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET, with the ﬁnding that increased occupancy resulted in
decreased tumor proliferation rate. The results suggested that quantitative SSTR imaging during octreotide
therapy has the potential to determine the fractional receptor occupancy in NETs, thereby allowing octreotide
dosing to be optimized readily in individual patients. Clinical trials validating this approach are warranted. Cancer

Introduction
Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a heterogeneous group of
malignancies that are thought to originate from endocrine
progenitor cells located in various organ systems including the
lung, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. Very commonly,
these NETs secrete a variety of biologically active peptides
and amines that can lead to symptoms of wheezing, nausea,
abdominal pain, ﬂushing, and diarrhea, among others (1).
Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) agonists have been employed
with great success for controlling these symptoms (1, 2). With
80% to 100% of well-differentiated NETs expressing high levels
of SSTR (3), somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide, have
become the treatment of choice for symptomatic relief through
the reduction of NET hormone production.

Over the past several years, it has further been demonstrated that SSTR agonists may also have an antiproliferative
effect on NETs (4, 5) and may have a role as antineoplastic
therapy for NETs. It was shown in a double-blind randomized
controlled trial that patients with metastatic well-differentiated mid-gut NETs who received monthly intramuscular
injections of a standard dose (30 mg) of long-acting octreotide (octreotide LAR) had a signiﬁcantly increased progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those who received
placebo (15.6 vs. 5.9 months, respectively; ref. 6). The patients
in this study beneﬁted from octreotide LAR therapy regardless of tumor functional status. The results of this trial
suggest that octreotide may possess antiproliferative properties on NETs that are enacted through SSTR-mediated
signaling, irrespective of activation of pathways involved in
bioactive peptide and amine production. This paradigm shift
in the use of SSTR agonists for their antitumor effects has
been empiric in nature, without an understanding of what
fraction of the somatostatin receptors were bound during
agonist therapy, how this changed over the course of a
monthly treatment cycle, and the association with proliferation. The development of a noninvasive approach to quantify the concentration of SSTR in tumors, the change in free
receptor fraction with therapy, and the resultant downstream
effects on proliferation would provide a method to optimize
this treatment, both at the individual level and across treatment populations.

Radionuclide imaging of SSTR through 111In-octreotide or
Ga–DOTATOC has largely been qualitative in nature, using the
high contrast gained from the images to locate foci of disease not
apparent on other imaging modalities or to monitor disease
progression by the assessment of tumor volume changes over
time (7–9). In fact, tumor imaging with these agents is typically
performed either for primary staging before initiation of octreotide LAR therapy or monitoring of disease progression during
the expected nadir blood levels of octreotide LAR to aid in tumor
visualization (10, 11). The objective in this study was to use the
quantitative nature of 68Ga–DOTATOC PET imaging to develop
a technique that allows one to compute the receptor density in a
tumor volume and monitor the fraction that is occupied with
agonist treatment at a given time, based on changes in the
available (unbound) receptor density. In combination with
another positron-emitting radiotracer, 18F-ﬂuoro-30 -deoxy-30 18
L-ﬂuorothymidine ( F-FLT), a proliferation marker (12), we
were able to correlate the changes in unoccupied SSTR with
proliferation status in an animal model. The imaging techniques
and quantitation methods thus developed have the potential to
be readily translated to patients with NETs to more effectively
monitor treatment and improve dosing regimens.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
AR42J [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)], an STTR
expressing rat pancreatic carcinoma, was cultured in F-12K
medium (ATCC), supplemented by 20% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. A549 (ATCC), an
SSTR-negative human alveolar basal epithelial carcinoma cell
line, was cultured in F-12K medium (ATCC), supplemented by
10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in a humidiﬁed incubator at
37 C, 5% CO2. Subculturing was performed employing a 0.25%
trypsin/0.1% EDTA solution. The cell lines were obtained from
ATCC and were used in this study for less than 6 months after
resuscitation. Cell lines undergo comprehensive quality control and authentication procedures by ATCC before shipment.
These include testing for mycoplasma by culture isolation,
Hoechst DNA staining, and PCR, together with culture testing
for contaminant bacteria, yeast, and fungi. Authentication
procedures used include species veriﬁcation by DNA barcoding
and identity veriﬁcation by DNA proﬁling.

Ga labeling of DOTATOC
A 68Ge/68Ga generator (iThemba Labs) was eluted with 6 mL
of 0.6 N HCl. The eluant was added to a buffer system of 2 mol/L
HEPES at pH 3.5 to 4.0 with 5 mg of DOTATOC. The reaction
solution was heated at 100 C for 20 minutes. The reaction
product was loaded on a reverse-phase C18 Sep-Pak mini
cartridge and eluted with 200 mL of 200-proof ethanol. The ﬁnal
formulation was adjusted to 10% ethanol in saline. The chemical
and radiochemical purity of 68Ga-DOTATOC was measured
through radio thin-layer chromatography (TLC; refs. 13, 14).
Competitive binding study
To evaluate the speciﬁc binding of 68Ga-DOTATOC, a competitive binding assay using a ﬁxed concentration of radio-

tracer and increasing concentration of octreotide acetate was
performed. AR42J (SSTR2-expressing) and A549 (SSTR-negative) cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2.5  105/well) and
allowed to grow to 80% conﬂuence. Wells were incubated for 1
hour with 0.01 to 1,000 mmol/L concentration of octreotide
acetate (Abbiotec). Then, 25 mCi 68Ga-DOTATOC (9.5 nmol/L
DOTATOC peptide) was added to each well and plates were
incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. The medium was removed and
wells were washed 3 times using 4 C PBS. Cells were collected
after trypsin treatment, and the number of cells in each well
was counted using an automated cell counter (Countess,
Invitrogen). 68Ga activity in the cells in each well was assayed
using an automated gamma counter (Wizard 2480, Perkin
Elmer) and decay corrected for the beginning of incubation
with 68Ga-DOTATOC.
In vitro cell-cycle assay
To assess the effect of octreotide on cell-cycle progression,
AR42J and A549 were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated at
37 C for 24 hours (A549) or 2 days (AR42J) in cell culture
medium. The medium was then removed and fresh medium
was added to each well. Wells were randomized to receive
octreotide acetate at a concentration of 1 mmol/L or no
octreotide acetate and all wells were incubated at 37 C for
24 hours before the addition of EdU (5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine;
Click-it EDU kit, Invitrogen), a ﬂuorescent DNA analog that is
incorporated during DNA synthesis. Treated cells were then
sorted for cell-cycle phase using ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) and the percentage of the cells in S-phase
determined in octreotide treated versus nontreated groups
for each cell line. Studies were performed in triplicate.
Western blotting for SSTR2 expression
Nude (nu/nu) mice were injected subcutaneously with 106
AR42J cells suspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in the left
upper ﬂank. After PET imaging, AR42J tumors were removed
and extracted and whole protein extract puriﬁcation performed. Protein samples (30 mg) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE
and run at 120 V and 14 mA for 1.5 hours. Gels were blotted on
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane and the blots
incubated overnight at 4 C with SSTR2 monoclonal antibody
(Abcam) at 1:500 dilution. b-Actin monoclonal antibody (Santa
Cruz) at 1:1,000 dilution was used as an internal control.
Detection was performed using the BM Chemiluminescence
Western Blotting Kit (Mouse/Rabbit; Roche) and imaged on
the Carestream In-Vivo Multispectral FX Imaging System.
Quantitation of SSTR2 and b-actin expression was performed
by drawing a region of interest around the protein bands on
chemiluminescence images acquired with the Carestream
Molecular Imaging Software. The acquired data were normalized using b-actin expression and corrected for tumor weight.
In vivo imaging studies
AR42J-bearing mice were divided randomly in 4 groups
(n ¼ 3 in each group) that received vehicle, 1.25, 2.5, or 10
mg/kg octreotide acetate, delivered via intraperitoneal injection every 6 hours for a total of 5 injections to reach steadystate blood levels. Five hours following injection of the ﬁfth

underwent dynamic PET imaging with 68Ga-DOTATOC.
Immediately following, the mice were imaged in static mode
and then a sixth dose of octreotide was administered. Five
hours after receiving the last dose of treatment solution the
mice were imaged using 18F-FLT PET in static mode.
Static PET imaging protocol
Approximately 400 mCi of 68Ga-DOTATOC prepared as
described above and diluted into a ﬁnal volume of 150 to
200 mL that was injected intravenously via tail vein, and 1 hour
later, static PET images were acquired for 15 minutes in 2 bed
positions using the Sedecal Argus microPET. Static PET imaging with 18F-FLT was performed 2 hours after intravenous
injection of 400 mCi 18F-FLT. Images were reconstructed using
2D-OSEM (4 iterations, 16 subsets) and were corrected for
scatter and randoms. The mean standard uptake value (SUVmean) for each tumor was calculated in a 3-dimensional (3D)
region of interest autodrawn around the tumor using a 30%
isocontour threshold.

Dynamic PET imaging protocol and compartmental
modeling
Mice were placed under anesthesia with 2% isoﬂurane in O2
and positioned on the scanner such that heart and tumor were
both in the ﬁeld of view. Dynamic PET data were acquired in
list mode for 60 minutes beginning immediately before injection of 400 mCi 68Ga-DOTATOC in 150 to 200 mL of volume via
tail vein. The list mode data were then reframed in 40 ﬁfteensecond, 20 thirty-second, 16 sixty-second, and 16 ninety-second frames. Scans were reconstructed and a 3D region of
interest was set around the tumor, as described above. The
input function was measured from a spherical region of
interest with a 3-mm diameter over the center of the mouse
heart. Time activity curves were plotted for tumor and blood
pool. To determine the best compartmental model ﬁt for 68GaDOTATOC binding, an octreotide challenge study was performed during a dynamic 68Ga-DOTATOC PET study in AR42Jbearing mice. The octreotide dose (150 mg) was injected via tail
vein 10 minutes after the scan start and the administration of
68
Ga-DOTATOC.

Ki-67 staining
To determine tumor cell proliferation changes in response
to octreotide therapy in vivo, Ki-67 staining was performed.
Tumor samples from AR42J tumor–bearing mice from the
different treatment groups described above were excised and
kept in frozen tissue-embedding ﬁxative (Fisher Scientiﬁc) at
80 C for further immunoﬂuorescent staining. Brieﬂy, slidemounted 5-mm-thick sections were prepared and ﬁxed using
ice-cold acetone for 10 minutes followed by 3 wash with PBS
(5 minutes each). Tissue sections were blocked for 30 minutes
with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS with Tween, washed
with PBS, and incubated overnight at þ4 C with Ki-67 antibody (Abcam). The slides were washed again with PBS,
mounted with mounting medium for ﬂuorescence-containing
DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and visualized by confocal ﬂuorescent microscopy (Nikon). Ki-67–stained and -unstained
cells in the resulting images were segmented using ImageJ,
software and the percentage of cells stained for Ki-67 was
determined.

Correlation of imaging ﬁndings with SSTR2 protein
levels
There was a consistent ratio between SSTR2 expression
level and 68Ga-DOTATOC quantitative imaging measures
irrespective of tumor size (tumors with diameter 3.9–8.2
mm) in AR42J tumors. The total 68Ga-DOTATOC uptake of
the tumors as measured by the molecular tumor burden
(MTB; ref. 15) on PET studies, which were acquired in the
static mode, strongly correlates with the total SSTR2 content
in tumors (R2 ¼ 0.99, P < 0.0001), as seen in Fig. 2A. MTB is
the product of SUVmean and molecular tumor volume (total
volume of the voxels in the region of interest with 68GaDOTATOC uptake above the deﬁned threshold; ref. 16).
Moreover, the mean 68Ga-DOTATOC uptake in tumors
(SUVmean) also strongly correlates (Fig. 2B) with the expression of SSTR2 normalized for b-actin expression (R2 ¼ 0.85,
P < 0.0004). These ﬁndings demonstrate that the noninvasively measured 68Ga-DOTATOC uptake is a true reﬂection
of the SSTR2 levels in the tumors.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism 5. Unpaired t test was used to compare the number of
cells in S-phase in control and treatment groups. One-way
ANOVA was employed to discern the differences in SUVmean
and Ki among different treatment groups in mice. Tukey
multiple comparison test was used to compare the signiﬁcance
between groups. The 68Ga-DOTATOC inﬂux rate and SUVmean were plotted against 18F-FLT SUVmean, and correlation
between the measurements was determined using linear
regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Mean values are reported  SEM.

68
Ga-DOTATOC demonstrated 8.6-fold greater binding to
AR42J compared to A549 cells (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A). This is
consistent with the high expression of SSTR type 2 in AR42J
cells and undetectable expression of SSTR2 in A549 cells. In
the competition receptor-binding assay, nonlabeled octreotide
competed speciﬁcally with the 68Ga-DOTATOC for binding to
the AR42J cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of AR42J cells
with increasing doses of octreotide acetate led to decreased
68
Ga-DOTATOC uptake. 68Ga-DOTATOC inﬂux was completely inhibited at an octreotide concentration of 10 mmol/L or
higher. A549 did not show considerable 68Ga-DOTATOC
uptake or displacement with octreotide treatment. This ﬁnding shows that 68Ga-DOTATOC can be used to monitor the
SSTR octreotide occupancy in SSTR expressing cells. Cell-cycle
assays were performed to demonstrate the effect of octreotide
on cell proliferation. As seen in Fig. 1C and D, for SSTRexpressing AR42J cells, treatment with octreotide decreased
the percentage of cells in S-phase by 53% compared to control
(P < 0.001). In SSTR nonexpressing A549 cells, treatment with
octreotide did not lead to a signiﬁcant difference in S-phase
compared to control (P > 0.5). These data suggest that octreotide exerts a downstream inhibitory effect on cell proliferation
through somatostatin receptors.

displaceable following competitive challenge. The displaceable fraction was the 68Ga-DOTATOC bound to SSTR but not
yet internalized, whereas the remaining component was
already internalized and non-displaceable (Fig. 3A and C).
These ﬁndings were compatible with an irreversible 2-compartment tissue model (Fig. 3E; ref. 17). Thus, on the basis of
the equations in Fig. 3F, we employed a Patlak graphical plot
and calculated the tumor inﬂux constant (Ki; refs. 18, 19). We
noted that for all studies, steady state was achieved in less
than 25 minutes, and thus a 25-minute cutoff was used for
ﬁtting the Ki. The net 68Ga-DOTATOC inﬂux rate, measured
using a Patlak plot, following IV challenge of octreotide
decreased to 0.0 (mL plasma)/(mL tissue)1/min1 (Fig.

plasma)/(mL tissue)1/min1 without an octreotide challenge (Fig. 3D).
The parameter Ki, which is the net rate of 68Ga-DTOATOC
inﬂux, is independent of tumor perfusion and reﬂects the
number of available receptors as well as the rate of receptor
trafﬁcking (17–19). Measurement of the Ki in AR42J tumors
demonstrated that octreotide treatment signiﬁcantly
decreased the rate of tracer inﬂux in all treatment groups
compared to control and that the mean Ki monotonically
decreased with higher doses. The mean Ki was 0.67  0.02,

Ga-DOTATOC.
Static 68Ga-DOTATOC PET imaging of AR42J tumors
Static scan results conﬁrmed and paralleled the results
of dynamic 68Ga-DOTATOC PET imaging. Treatment with
increasing doses of octreotide acetate led to progressively
signiﬁcant decreases in tumor SUVmean compared to control. Representative images are shown in Fig. 5. The mean
SUVmean was 0.96  0.05, 0.88  0.08, 0.42  0.03, and 0.21 
0.04 in vehicle, 1.25, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg treatment groups,
respectively (Fig. 6B). As shown in the Fig. 6D, there was a
very strong correlation between tumor SUVmean and Ki
measured by static and dynamic 68Ga-DOTATOC PET imaging
(R2 ¼ 0.95, P < 0.0001). The high agreement of quantitative
parameters between static and dynamic 68Ga-DOTATOC PET
in our study suggests that SUVmean of the tumors in static
PET, although not as accurate as Ki measured by dynamic
PET for free receptor density, can be effectively employed to
monitor SSTR occupancy with octreotide treatment.
Static 18F-FLT PET imaging and its correlation with
68
Ga-DOTATOC PET imaging
Treatment with octreotide acetate decreased the SUVmean
of 18F-FLT tumor uptake in all treatment groups compared to
the control group. As with dynamic and static 68Ga-DOTATOC

6870

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

PET imaging, higher doses of octreotide led to monotonically
decreasing 18F-FLT PET SUVmean. The mean SUVmean was
1.40  0.10, 1.30  0.08, 0.34  0.06, and 0.18  0.03 in vehicle,
1.25, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively, as seen
in Fig. 6. There was a strong correlation between the SUVmean
of the tumors in 18F-FLT PET scans and both SUVmean and
Ki of tumors in 68Ga-DOTATOC PET scans (R2 ¼ 0.95, P <
0.0001 and R2 ¼ 0.97, P < 0.0001, respectively; Fig. 6E and F).
This demonstrates that increased occupancy of SSTR with
octreotide results in a reduced rate of tumor proliferation in
vivo, assessed by static18F-FLT PET; the magnitude of reduction in tumor proliferation rate is directly correlated with
and dependent on the level of SSTR octreotide occupancy
and thus can be potentially monitored using 68Ga-DOTATOC PET imaging.
Ki-67 staining results
Treatment of AR42J tumors with increasing doses of octreotide led to a reduction in the percentage of cells staining for Ki67. The mean percentage of cells stained for Ki-67 was 25  1.2,
23  0.8, 11  0.9, and 5  1.1 in the vehicle, 1.25, 2.5, and 10
mg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Increase in the SSTR
octreotide occupancy results in a corresponding decrease in
the rate of tumor proliferation shown by the decrease in
relative number of cells stained for Ki-67 (Fig. 5). These results
are consistent with the results obtained by noninvasive
18
F-FLT PET imaging and further conﬁrm the enhanced antiproliferative effects of octreotide on tumor cells with increasing level of SSTR octreotide occupancy.

Discussion
Octreotide continues to play a key role in the treatment of
patients with metastatic NET, both for the control of symptoms of hypersecretion and, more recently, for control of tumor
growth (1, 20–22). In an efﬁcacy clinical trial called the PROMID trial (6), it was shown that a ﬁxed monthly injection of
octreotide LAR signiﬁcantly increased the time to tumor
progression in patients with metastatic mid-gut carcinoids by
8.3 months compared to placebo, demonstrating the antiproliferative effect of octreotide LAR on well-differentiated midgut NETs. However, the potential for optimized individual
dosing of octreotide to lead to further signiﬁcant improvements in PFS has never been explored. Quantitative noninvasive assessment of somatostatin receptor occupancy and
downstream pharmacodynamic assessment of proliferation,
as demonstrated in this study, could directly guide such
personalized dosing optimization.
This paradigm shift from the use of imaging for disease
detection to disease characterization, including the direct and
downstream molecular effects of therapy on speciﬁc tumors,
provides an opportunity to use such assessment to prospectively guide tailored therapy rather than retrospective reporting on treatment effectiveness measured by tumor volume
changes. Such paired imaging of upstream intracellular signaling from cell surface receptors and downstream effects such
as proliferation changes or alterations in apoptosis rates could
be applied to a broad range of targeted therapies for individual
patient drug dosing optimization. This includes therapies

targeted at receptor tyrosine kinases, estrogen receptors, and
androgen receptors, among other targets.
The quantitative nature of the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET measurements allows an indirect assessment of fractional SSTR occupancy. Our kinetic model is similar to that developed by Henze
and colleagues (17) for characterization of the kinetics of 68GaDOTATOC uptake in brain meningiomas. Using dynamic PET
imaging, we established that 68Ga-DOTATOC and octreotide
directly compete for binding to SSTR and that binding of
somatostatin analogs results in irreversible internalization
(23) of the ligand receptor complex. Using this tracer kinetic
model, we could then reliably calculate SSTR free fraction with
increasing doses of octreotide. We demonstrated a highly signiﬁcant correlation between the net tracer inﬂux rate (Ki) and
the SUV measurement. The net tracer inﬂux rate (Ki) is measured by Patlak graphical analysis of dynamic PET data based on
an irreversible 2-compartment kinetic model, which removes
the effects of perfusion from the calculated receptor-mediated
uptake values, whereas SUV, which is calculated from static PET
data, is more routinely employed in the clinic and does not
separate perfusion effects from the receptor mediated uptake.
For clinical translation, both the net tracer inﬂux rate (Ki) and
SUV measurements could be determined in patients. Given the
typical enhancement pattern seen on CT scanning of carcinoid
tumors (24, 25) suggestive of high tumoral perfusion, these may
correlate clinically as well as in preclinical assessment performed in this study, providing a means to more simply translate
this approach for patient assessment.

One possible limitation to measuring receptor occupancy
level using PET imaging is that it is most useful when the
receptor-targeted therapy such as octreotide is in the subsaturating range. If the administered dose of octreotide is high enough
to completely saturate receptors, then there will be no tracer
uptake in the intracellular compartment; in these circumstances, receptor quantitation using PET imaging shows complete occupancy and the degree of excess octreotide dose cannot
be assessed. In practice, the majority of carcinoid patients is
given subsaturating doses of octreotide (26) and may beneﬁt
from dose adjustment using the proposed approach.
The association between SSTR occupancy and tumor proliferation observed in the animal models used in our study
suggests that dose optimization of octreotide based on receptor occupancy measurements in individual patients may be
clinically beneﬁcial. Speciﬁcally, quantitative PET imaging of
the free somatostatin receptor fraction measured with 68GaDOTATOC, coupled with PET imaging of proliferation measured with 18F-FLT, provides a multiparametric means for
potentially optimizing octreotide LAR dosing in patients with
carcinoid tumors on an individual basis. Such personalized
treatment may provide additional beneﬁt over standard uniform dosing approaches currently employed. This image-guided approach to individualized drug dosing may also be
employed for other receptor-targeted therapies in cancer
treatment in the future. Validation of this approach in clinical
trials is warranted.
