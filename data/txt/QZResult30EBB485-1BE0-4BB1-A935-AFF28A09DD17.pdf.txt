ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease, including different subtypes
having diverse incidence, drug-sensitivity and survival rates. In particular, claudinlow and basal-like BC have mesenchymal features with a dismal prognosis.
Disialoganglioside GD2 is a typical neuroectodermal antigen expressed in a variety
of cancers. Despite its potential relevance in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, the
presence and role of GD2 require further investigation, especially in BC. Therefore, we
evaluated GD2 expression in a cohort of BC patients and its correlation with clinicalpathological features.
Sixty-three patients with BC who underwent surgery without prior chemo- and/
or radiotherapy between 2001 and 2014 were considered. Cancer specimens were
analyzed by immunohistochemistry and GD2-staining was expressed according to the
percentage of positive cells and by a semi-quantitative scoring system.
Patient characteristics were heterogeneous by age at diagnosis, histotype, grading,
tumor size, Ki-67 and receptor-status. GD2 staining revealed positive cancer cells in 59%
of patients. Among them, 26 cases (41%) were labeled with score 1+ and 11 (18%) with
score 2+. Notably, the majority of metaplastic carcinoma specimens stained positive for
GD2. The univariate regression logistic analysis revealed a significant association of GD2
with triple-receptor negative phenotype and older age (> 78) at diagnosis.
We demonstrate for the first time that GD2 is highly prevalent in a cohort of
BC patients clustering on very aggressive BC subtypes, such as triple-negative and
metaplastic variants.

INTRODUCTION

BC is a heterogeneous disease with different patterns of
incidence, survival and drug-sensitivity. In the last few
years gene expression profiling identified five molecular
intrinsic subtypes. In the early 2000 luminal A, luminal
B, Her2-enriched and basal-like BC were described [2–4].

Breast cancer (BC) survival rates have increased
in the last decades, thanks to intense screening programs
and to increasingly targeted and effective therapeutics [1].

Later, Prat et al. defined a claudin-low subtype,
characterized by low expression of genes involved in cellcell adhesion, high mesenchymal features and with stem
cell features [5]. While the luminal A and B can be mostly
identified by estrogen and progesterone receptors and the
Her2-enriched subtypes by a HER2 positivity, the highly
aggressive basal-like and claudin-low tumors are included
in the triple negative BC (TNBC) phenotype and still
lack of more defined markers [4, 5]. Moreover Lehmann
et al. identified six TNBC subtypes displaying unique
gene expression (basal-like 1 and 2, immunomodulatory,
mesenchymal, mesenchymal stem-like and luminal
androgen receptor) capable to inform therapy selection [6].
In this perspective we focused on disialoganglioside
GD2, a surface antigen, primarily expressed in the nervous
system and skin melanocytes as well as in the stromal
component of other normal tissues [7]. More recently, we
have identified GD2 as a surface marker of mesenchymal
stromal cells (MSC), adult progenitors that can be
isolated from different tissues and ex vivo expanded [8].
In cancer, disialoganglioside GD2 is typically expressed in
neuroectodermal tumors, such as neuroblastoma, glioma
and melanoma [9, 10], but it can also be found in a variety
of sarcomas [11–13].
Battula et al. identified GD2 as a suitable marker for
BC stem cells (BCSC) and its expression was described
in BC cell lines as well as in a few histological samples
[14]. Moreover, the inhibition of GD3 synthase, the
critical enzyme involved in GD2 synthesis, has been
shown to prevent metastasis in in-vivo mouse models,
to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
to compromise mesenchymal characteristics of claudinlow BC cell lines [14–16]. Despite the relevance of these
data, the possible role of GD2 as a BC biomarker and
therapeutic target still requires in-depth investigations.
For this reason, we sought to report for the first time
histological evidences of the GD2 expression pattern
in a heterogeneous cohort of BC samples, highlighting
the peculiar tendency of this antigen to correlate with a
mesenchymal-like phenotype and significantly with the
triple negative phenotype.

histological grade, in most cases (49/63; 78%) tumors were
G3; the other cases (14/63; 22%) were G2.
Tumor size ranged from 0,7 cm to 10 cm, with a
mean of 3,2 ± 2,4 cm with 42 (67 %) patients having a
Ki-67 expression greater than 20%. Twenty-seven samples
(43%) were pT1, 22 (35%) were pT2, 11 (17 %) were
pT3 and three samples were pT4 (5%). Forty patients
(63%) were both hormone receptors and HER2 negative
(TNBC). Eighteen cases (29%) were hormone receptors
positive, but did not over-expressed HER2. Five samples
over-expressed HER2: 3 (5%) were also hormone receptor
positive, 2 (3%) were ER/PR negative.

GD2 marks BC cells clustering on TNBC
The evaluation of GD2 IHC staining in the sixtythree BC specimens revealed an antigen expression in 37
cases (59%).
According to our GD2 semi-quantitative scoring
system (Figure 1), 26 cases (41%) were negative (score 0);
among the GD2 positive specimens (37/63; 59%), 26
(41%) were identified with score 1+ and 11 (18%) with
score 2+. The percentage of positive cells in the GD2
expressing specimens was extremely variable, ranging
from 3% to 100%, with a mean of 52% ± 30%. Having
observed this positivity, we focused on the staining
pattern. GD2 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm
(Figure 2A). Additionally, BC cells showed a GD2 staining
reinforcement on the cell membrane (Figure 2B). Of note
stroma and normal glandular ducts were apparently not
stained, confirming the specificity of staining on BC cells
(Figure 2C).
After observing the relevance of the staining, we
then correlated the GD2 status with clinical-pathological
parameters as shown in Table 2. No statistical correlation
was found between GD2 and the considered variables
according to Student’s t-test, χ2 test and Fisher’s
exact test. However, the samples from metaplastic
sarcomatoid carcinoma retained the highest staining, with
GD2 expression mostly related to spindle cells versus
epithelioid elements (Figure 2D).
To further investigate a possible association of
GD2 with any of the clinical-pathological parameters
we performed both multivariate and univariate logistic
regression analyses. While multivariate analysis showed
no significant correlations (including Ki-67 expression),
the univariate analysis (Table 3) indicated that in GD2
positive specimens the possibility of being TNBC
was significantly higher than being ER/PR +/HER2–
(OR = 3.26; p = 0.04; 95% CI [1.03–10.37]), suggesting
how GD2 may represent a novel marker capable to
identify a still elusive BC subtype. We also compared
the GD2 expression in relationship with age, revealing
a significant correlation within the older patients range
(> 78) with significant higher GD2 expression (OR = 3.66;
p = 0.04; 95% CI [1.05–12.79]).

RESULTS
Patients
Clinical-pathological characteristics of the sixty-three
patients included in the study are shown in Table 1. Average
age at diagnosis was 67 ± 15 years old. The most represented
histological types were invasive ductal carcinoma
(IDC) not otherwise specified (NOS) (37/63; 59%),
metaplastic carcinoma (14/63; 22%) and invasive lobular
carcinoma (ILC) (7/63; 11%). The other cases included
mixed carcinoma (IDC + invasive lobular carcinoma)
(2/63; 3%), apocrine ductal carcinoma (2/63; 3%)
and one sample of carcinosarcoma (2%). Concerning the

DISCUSSION

[9, 10, 23–25]. In addition, GD2 labels soft tissue and
bone sarcomas [11–13, 26, 27]. In normal conditions,
although at lower levels, it is expressed in nervous tissues
and in adult progenitors [8, 20], confirming its role as both
neuroectodermal and mesenchymal marker.
Originally GD2 expression was investigated in
BC by Battula et al., who identified this ganglioside in
BC cell lines, showing positive levels between 0,1–18%
with the highest expression curiously related to a basallike phenotype [14]. The authors additionally focused on
BCSC reporting GD2 as their putative biomarker. BCSC
are a rare subset of cells within the tumor exhibiting a
high tumorigenic potential [28–30]. BCSC have also been
related to the EMT and to MSC, since the induction of EMT
in mammary cells results in the acquisition of features that
are typical of both BCSC and MSC [28, 29, 31, 32]. These
findings were also confirmed by Liang et al. focusing on the
expression profile of glycosphingolipids in human BCSC
[15]. The role of GD2 as a marker of EMT and BCSC in
BC was also indirectly demonstrated through the inhibition
of GD3 synthase, which compromised the initiation
and maintenance of EMT, as well as the mesenchymal
characteristics of claudin-low BC cell lines SUM159 and
MDA-MB-231 [16].

To the best of our knowledge, in this report we
describe the expression of GD2 in the largest cohort of
BC so far reported. By the introduction of a new semiquantitative IHC scoring system, we provide evidence
that the majority of the analyzed samples resulted GD2
positive.
Disialoganglioside GD2 is synthesized in the
endoplasmatic reticulum and Golgi’s apparatus by the
enzyme GD3 synthase. The antigen is then transferred
on the outside layer of the plasma membrane. On the
cell surface, GD2 is involved in cell-to-cell adhesion
and signal transduction, playing a crucial role both in
physiological (e.g. embryogenesis) and in pathological
processes, such as cancer, by driving proliferation,
neoangiogenesis, immune-escape and invasion. [17–19].
GD2 represents a typical marker of neuroectodermic
tumors. Neuroblastoma shows a constant expression of
this ganglioside, which has been exploited as a therapeutic
target for monoclonal antibody and cellular therapy [7,
20–22]. GD2 was also found in tissue sections and cell
lines of other neuroectodermic tumors, such as skin and
uveal melanoma, small cell lung cancer and glial tumors

The immunohistochemical analysis of GD2
expression in our 63 specimens showed a positive staining
in 59% of the cases. Battula et al. considered 12 patients
with a variety of BC histotypes and, considering as an
arbitrary cut-off of 5%, their positivity level seems similar
(58.3%) to the one here reported in a greater BC cohort.
Their positive cells ranged from 0.5 to 37.9% and, very
interestingly, the highest positivity is described in the two
metastatic specimens peaking in the only TNBC specimen
included in the study [14]. No correlation analyses with
clinical-pathological features were performed in that study,
presumably due to the low number of included patients.
In this research we focused on GD2 expression
pattern, originally showing a cytoplasmatic along with a
membrane staining by IHC. While GD2 has been reported
to be predominately exposed on the cell membrane, GD2
pattern in BC is coherent with results reported in other
neuroectodermal and mesenchymal neoplasms [12, 20, 27]
and it can be due to the biosynthetic pathway of the
ganglioside.
Our cohort of BC was heterogeneous by age at
diagnosis, histotype, grading, Ki-67, tumor size and
receptor phenotype. Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact test
and multivariate logistic regression analysis did not

demonstrate any statistically significant correlation
between GD2 expression and any of these variables,
including Ki-67. The age appeared as a discriminant factor
with older patients having a greater GD2 level, however
this finding may be biased by the fact that most of OUR
metasplastic BC samples falls into an advanced age. In this
sense a larger patient cohort shall be requested to further
validate these findings. Interestingly, the univariate logistic
regression analysis showed a statistically significant
correlation of ganglioside GD2 with triple-negative BC
in comparison to ER/PR +/HER2 –, thus confirming the
preliminary data in a single case of TNBC reported [14].
A similar trend was found with metaplastic carcinomas
compared to IDC, although not statistically significant.
Some considerations have to be shared about GD2
expression pattern according to the histotype. Despite
the limited number of patients included in the study, the
majority of metaplastic breast carcinoma samples were
GD2 positive, showing the strongest staining in their
spindle-like elements and not in their epithelial-like
component. The expression of BCSC-related antigens
and EMT markers (Zeb-1, E-cadherin) has already been
demonstrated in metaplastic BC histological specimens,
where the positivity was mostly related to the non-

epithelial/mesenchymal part of these tumors [33]. BCSC
biomarkers, including GD2 in association with ALDH,
were also described in a cohort of phyllodes tumors, a
rare subtype of breast neoplasm that shows some affinities
with metaplastic tumors [34]. We can speculate that
GD2 expression in the BC specimens analyzed in this
study might be related to BCSC and to the activation of
the process of EMT. We also suggest that GD2-positive
specimens contain cells that are undergoing EMT and
the association of GD2 with the triple-receptor negative
phenotype along with the constant expression of this
antigen in the metaplastic BC specimens seems to
corroborate this. These neoplasms are in fact characterized
by a structural mesenchymal component [33, 35] and
might exhibit a more constitutive and regular expression
of BCSC and EMT biomarkers, including GD2.
This investigation retains limitations mostly due to
the small sample size and to the sampling method. However,
the study had an explorative intent and was performed since
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

no consistent data on GD2 and its correlation with clinicalpathological parameters in BC have been previously
reported. Another limitation of the study is the lack of an
external validation of GD2 IHC staining procedures and
scoring system. In this case a relevant effort was dedicated
to identify an anti-GD2 antibody capable to generate
consistent results on paraffin embedded BC specimens.
The proposed scoring system has now to be challenged
in a larger cohort of patients in the effort to generate a
standardized method for GD2 immunohistochemical
evaluation in BC and, possibly, in other cancer types.
To conclude, GD2 staining was for the first time
described in a heterogeneous cohort of BC specimens,
showing a possible correlation with histotypes strongly
associated with EMT. Although studies are now needed to
consolidate these results, GD2 appears as a new biomarker
in BC, in particular for the TNBC variants, which are still
orphans of specific markers for diagnostics and possible
targeted therapies.

minutes at 37°C, using an automatic immunohistochemical
staining device (Benchmark XT; Ventana Medical
Systems, Tucson, AZ). The reaction was subsequently
detected with the appropriate reagent from Kit Ventana
DAB (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Lastly,
sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin and
analyzed by standard light microscope (Axio Imager M2 Zeiss) with Plan-Apochromat 20X/0.8, EC Plan-Neofluar
40X/0.75 and EC Plan-Neofluar 63X/1.25-Oil objectives.
Slides stained with no primary antibody were used as
negative control. Photomicrographs were acquired with
Axiocam 506 color camera (software ZEN pro - Zeiss).

Patients and specimens
The archive of the Pathology Division of Modena
University Hospital and Padua University Hospital
was searched to identify sixty-three female patients
diagnosed with infiltrating BC from 2001 to 2014, with
available samples from primary tumors (mastectomy or
quadrantectomy specimens). Clinical-pathological data
included age at diagnosis, tumor size (T), histological
type, histological grade (according to the Nottingham
Grading System [36]), Ki-67, Estrogen receptor,
Progesterone receptor and HER2 status as described in
the pathological report and confirmed by the pathologist’s
review. As stated in the latest ASCO/CAP guidelines
[37], hormone receptors were considered positive when
≥ 1% of cancer cells stained by immunohistochemistry
(IHC). HER2 was assessed as over-expressed in those
cases showing ISH positive, or IHC score 3+, or IHC
score 2+ and ISH positive (ASCO/CAP guidelines 2013
[38]). Prior treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy
was an exclusion criterion. Written informed consent was
obtained from alive patients. According to these inclusion
and exclusion criteria, we selected a cohort of 51 BC
specimens for a preliminary evaluation of GD2 staining.
After observing a relevant expression of the antigen in
three samples of metaplastic BC included in this initial
dataset, we enriched our population with 12 more cases
of metaplastic BC, so that a final cohort of 63 patients
was considered. The study protocol was approved by the
Ethical Committees of Modena and Padua.

Scoring
Any distinct positive IHC staining of BC cells within
the samples was regarded as positive GD2 expression, with
a modified scoring system from Ziebarth et al. there applied
in uterine leiomyosarcoma [27]. With the aim to properly
quantify GD2 expression in the considered specimens, we
established a semi-quantitative scoring system, based on
three different levels of staining intensity: 0 (negative),
1+ (low positivity), 2+ (high positivity). In those samples
having either 1+ or 2+ score, the portion of GD2 positive
tumor cells was expressed as percentage (%).

Statistical analysis
The primary study endpoint was the evaluation
of GD2 expression and its correlation with clinicalpathological features in a cohort of BC patients. Given
the explorative aim of this investigation, no sample size
calculation was performed. Relationships between the BC
clinical-pathological parameters and GD2 expression were
analyzed using χ2 test and Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables; Student’s t-test was used for continuous
variables. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analyses were performed. The significance level
was set at p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using STATA13
(StataCorp. 2011. Stata: Release 12. Statistical Software.
College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).

Immunohistochemistry
Preliminary IHC tests with different anti-GD2
antibodies (Table 4) were performed on neuroblastoma
and melanoma histological specimens and cell lines
(data not shown), in order to set up the procedure. After
extensive testing, the selected antibody was an anti-GD2
rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution; Matreya LLC,
Pleasant Gap, PA). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
4-μm-thick tissue sections from BC specimens were
transferred to microscope slides. Sections were dried
overnight at 40°C; after heat-induced antigen retrieval,
slides were incubated with the anti-GD2 antibody for 12
