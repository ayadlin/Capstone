Abstract
Retinoic acid (RA) is known to regulate cell growth and
differentiation. In HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells,
it causes mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
leading to myeloid differentiation and G0 cell cycle arrest.
This communication reports that expression of the Cbl adaptor caused enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2
activation and promoted RA-induced differentiation and
G0-arrest. Stable transfectants ectopically expressing c-Cbl
underwent myeloid differentiation faster than wild-type (wt)
cells when treated with RA. In contrast, c-Cbl knockdown
stable transfectants differentiated slower than wt cells when
treated with RA. Cells ectopically expressing c-Cbl had
enhanced CD38 expression when treated with RA, and cells
ectopically expressing CD38 had enhanced c-Cbl expression,
even without with RA, suggesting an interaction between c-Cbl
and CD38. Fluorescence resource energy transfer and coimmunoprecipitation showed that c-Cbl and CD38 bind each
other. RA causes the gradual down-regulation and eventual
loss of c-Cbl expression, resulting in loss of the Cbl-CD38
interaction, suggesting that c-Cbl plays a relatively early role
in promoting RA-induced differentiation. RA-induced differentiation can thus be propelled by c-Cbl and by CD38, both of
which bind together, enhance the expression of each other,
and cause MAPK signaling. There thus seems to be a
cooperative role for c-Cbl and CD38, reflected in their direct
binding, in propulsion of RA-induced differentiation. [Cancer

Introduction
Retinoic acid (RA) is a form of vitamin A, which is a necessary
dietary factor for juvenile development and plays a variety of
functions in adults (1). RA induces morphologic and functional
terminal differentiation and can be used therapeutically for
chemoprevention and treatment of cancer (2), notably acute promyelocytic leukemia, making its mechanism of action of significant
interest. The human myeloblastic leukemia cell line (HL-60) has
been one of the archetype in vitro models for studying the
mechanism of RA action (3–5). HL-60 cells undergo G0 cell cycle
arrest and myeloid differentiation in response to RA or monocytic
differentiation in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. More
interestingly, RA causes activation of mitogen-activated protein

kinase (MAPK) signaling, which is necessary to induce differentiation and G0 cell cycle arrest (6, 7).
Cbl is a member of a protein family that is structurally and
functionally conserved in multicellular organisms. Several studies
have shown the pivotal role of Cbl proteins through adaptor
function and E3 ligase activity (8–12). Cbl proteins have a highly
conserved NH2-terminal domain, termed the tyrosine kinase–
binding domain, which binds to phosphotyrosines on activated
receptor tyrosine kinases and other signaling proteins (9, 13, 14), a
short linker region, and a Ring finger domain that binds ubiquitinconjugating enzymes (10, 15, 16). Because of the conserved structure of their NH2 termini, all members of the Cbl family possess the
characteristics of recognizing activated target proteins and of
mediating their ubiquitination, which is crucial for their function
in regulating signaling pathways (15–17). It is well documented
that Cbl proteins interact with several intracellular signaling
molecules, including kinases, adaptors, and structural proteins, and
such an interactome can form signal component networks that
control multiple cellular processes (14, 18, 19).
Kontani and colleagues (20) suggested that c-Cbl tyrosine
phosphorylation was mediated by the human cell surface antigen
CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein originally identified as
an activation antigen of T and B cells. CD38 is expressed on several
leukocytes and early hematopoietic precursor cells and has a long
COOH-terminal extracellular domain and a short NH2-terminal
cytoplasmic tail (21). The effects mediated by CD38 include the
production of proinflammatory cytokines, proliferation, and
protection from apoptosis in lymphocytes (22–24). CD38 can be
found in lipid rafts and signals through extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) activation and also causes RAF activation
(25, 26). It thus activates MAPK signaling, which regulates cellular
processes such as proliferation and differentiation. The studies by
Lamkin and colleagues (27) have suggested that RA induces the
early expression of CD38, which signals through MAPK to promote
RA-induced cell differentiation. In hematologic neoplasias, the role
of CD38 has been enigmatic. It has been attributed with potentially
both pro-proliferative and antiproliferative effects. It has at times
also been considered as a prognostic indicator of better or worse
disease (22, 28, 29).
It is becoming evident that multiple direct and indirect
interactions between c-Cbl and many signaling proteins have been
detected; however, the functional significance of protein complexes
assembled around c-Cbl remains unclear. The finding of novel
interactions of c-Cbl with CD38 is of significance for understanding the role of c-Cbl and c-Cbl–interacting proteins in the regulation of signaling pathways. In this study, we have succeeded
in establishing c-Cbl stable transfectants and knockdown cell
lines and clearly indicated the interaction between c-Cbl and
CD38 by using independent techniques. We found that high CD38
caused increased c-Cbl expression and overexpression of c-Cbl also

enhanced RA-induced CD38 expression. This study also shows the
role of c-Cbl in differentiation and cell cycle arrest of HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells. We found that stable transfectants
ectopically expressing c-Cbl caused enhanced ERK2 activation
and promoted RA-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest. In
contrast, knocking down c-Cbl expression by stably transfected
small interfering RNA (siRNA) retarded differentiation and arrest.
Our study also suggests that CD38/c-Cbl binding together plays a
cooperative role in promoting RA-induced differentiation and cell
cycle arrest.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human myeloblastic leukemia cells (HL-60) and their
derivatives (CD38 stable transfectants, c-Cbl knockdowns, and c-Cbl stable
transfectants) were grown and cultured as previously described (30). To
maintain CD38 and c-Cbl high expression in stable transfectants or c-Cbl
low expression in knockdown cells, the cells were periodically resorted
based on high expression of fluorescent enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSAria flow cytometer,
BD Biosciences).
Chemicals. RA (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 1 Amol/L as
previously described (30).
siRNA c-Cbl. siRNA c-Cbl (human) was designed and obtained from
GenScript and cloned into a commercially available vector, pRNAT-U6.1/
Neo, using BamH1 and HindIII sites (GenScript).
Reverse transcription-PCR and plasmid construction. Total RNA of
human c-Cbl was isolated from HL-60 cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen), and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized according to the
protocol of the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen).
DNA fragments carrying complete human c-Cbl gene were generated by
PCR amplication using the oligonucleotides ( forward, 5¶-CGGGATCCATGGCCGGCAACGTGAAGAA-3¶; reverse, 5¶-GCGGTACCCTAGGTAGCTACATGGGCA-3¶) and cloned into a pRNAT-U6.1/Neo vector using
BamH1 and Kpn1 sites. CD38 plasmid construction was described
previously (27). All inserts were confirmed by sequencing.
CD11b, CD38, and c-Cbl expression studies by flow cytometry. HL-60
cells (0.5  106) were harvested at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. For CD11b and
CD38, cells were resuspended in 100 AL PBS containing 5 AL of
allophycocyanin (APC)–conjugated anti-CD11b antibody and phycoerythrin
(PE)–conjugated anti-CD38 antibody (BD Biosciences). Following incubation for 1 h at 37jC, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (LSRII flow
cytometer, BD Biosciences) using 633-nm red laser and 488-nm blue laser
excitations. The threshold to determine percent increase of expression was
set at the highest 5% of control cells. To stain for c-Cbl, cells were fixed
by resuspension in 100 AL PBS with 2% paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar) with
10-min incubation at room temperature and then permeabilized by
addition of 900 AL 20jC methanol with 20 min at 20jC. After washing
twice with 1 mL PBS, cells were stained with anti-c-Cbl polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature.
Following incubation and washing, cells were stained with an Alexa Fluor
350–conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h and
analyzed by flow cytometry. Results given as mean fluorescence intensity
were determined by quantifying the fluorescence intensity of the gated
entire cell population.
ERK phosphorylation. Cells (0.5  106) were fixed and permeabilized as
mentioned above. Following incubation and two washes, cells were stained
with Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell
Signaling) antibody for 1 h and analyzed by flow cytometry. The gate to
determine percent increase of expression was set at the highest 5% of HL-60
control cells, which represents basal levels of phosphorylated ERK (pERK).
Cell populations exceeding basal ERK on RA treatments were detected by
their positive shift above the basal levels from control cells.
Measurement of inducible oxidative metabolism. Cells (0.5  106)
were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 200 AL 37jC
PBS containing 10 Amol/L 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydro-

12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma) with incubation for
20 min in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC. Flow cytometric
analysis was done as previously described (31).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells (0.5  106) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 200 AL hypotonic staining solution containing
50 Ag/mL propidium iodine, 1 AL/mL Triton X-100, and 1 mg/mL sodium
citrate. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and analyzed by
flow cytometry (BD LSRII) using 488-nm excitation.
c-Cbl stable transfection. Fifty micrograms of plasmid DNA were
transfected into HL-60 cells as previously described (32) and selected with
G418 (1 mg/mL) for 2 to 3 wk. Stable transfectants underwent three cycles
of cell sorting and amplification to select cells expressing high fluorescent
EGFP using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSAria flow cytometer).
Western blots probed with anti-c-Cbl antibody (BD Biosciences) were
performed to confirm c-Cbl expression.
c-Cbl/CD38 double-stable transfection. Fifty micrograms of CD38
plasmid DNA were transfected into c-Cbl stable transfectant cells as
previously described (32) and selected with G418 (1 mg/mL) for 2 wk.
Double transfectants were stained with APC-conjugated anti-CD38
antibody, sorted, and amplified three cycles to select cells expressing high
CD38 using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The expression of CD38 was
confirmed by flow cytometry using APC-conjugated anti-CD38 antibody.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot. Cells (2.5  107) were lysed
using 200 AL lysis buffer (Pierce) and lysates were cleared by centrifugation
at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4jC. Ten microliters of polyclonal antibody
against c-Cbl were added and maintained with gentle shaking at 4jC
overnight. Negative control using an equivalent amount of normal rabbit
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included. Fifty microliters of protein
A/G PLUS agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added and
the final mixture was incubated at 4jC under rotary agitation overnight.
The protein-antibody-protein A/G slurry was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
2 min and washed thrice with coimmunoprecipitation buffer (Pierce). The
immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted using
anti-c-Cbl and anti-CD38 primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase–
linked, anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (BD Biosciences). For Western blot analyses, equal amounts of protein lysates (8 Ag)
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and
probed with the same antibodies shown in immunoprecipitation. Ponceau
S staining (Sigma) and reprobing with h-actin antibody (Cell signaling) were
used to check uniform loading.
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Flow cytometric fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were designed and analyzed
at the Cornell Biomedical Science Flow Cytometry Core Facility with the
assistance and consultation of Dr. James L. Smith. Cells (0.5  106) were
fixed in paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by methanol as described
above. After two washes, cells were resuspended in 200 AL PBS containing
5 AL of primary rabbit anti-c-Cbl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse
anti-CD38 (BD Biosciences) antibodies and then stained with Alexa Fluor
350–conjugated and Alexa Fluor 430–conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat
anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The immunocomplexes were
analyzed using a BD LSRII flow cytometer. For the HL-60, the FRET signal
was measured using 325-nm excitation ( from a UV laser) of Alexa Fluor
350 to excite Alexa Fluor 430 measuring the emitted fluorescence through a
505 long-pass dichroic and a 530/30 band-pass filter. For the NB4 FRET
measurement, Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated and Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated
goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used. The
FRET signal was measured using 488-nm excitation ( from a blue laser) of
Alexa Fluor 488 to excite Alexa Fluor 594 measuring the emitted
fluorescence through a 600 long-pass dichroic and a 610/20 band-pass
filter. Controls with secondary antibody(s) only or secondary(s) plus c-Cbl
or CD38 primary antibody were included. Cells stained with just c-Cbl or
CD38 primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 350 or Alexa Fluor 430, respectively,
were used for compensation controls for spillover into all fluorescence
collection channels. FRET signals were corrected by subtraction of
background fluorescence of negative controls with just secondary antibodies and compensation controls.

Statistics. Three independent repeats were conducted in all experiments. Error bars represent SE of three repeats. StatView statistical package
(version 5.0.1; SAS Institute, Inc.) was used to analyze the data via ANOVA
and Fisher’s protected least-squares difference test.

Results
c-Cbl and CD38 promoted RA-induced cell differentiation.
To determine the role of c-Cbl in RA-induced differentiation of
myeloid leukemia cell lines, we established c-Cbl stable transfectants (c-Cbl+) and siRNA knockdown (c-Cbl ) stable transfectant cell lines. HL-60 wild-type (wt) and vector control cells
showed no differences in proliferation or differentiation and
behaved indistinguishably in all experiments reported. Western
blots verified that c-Cbl protein expression was appropriately
enhanced or diminished in the stable transfectants (Fig. 1). Figure 1
also shows that c-Cbl expression diminished following RA
treatment to induce myeloid differentiation. The ability of these
different transfectant cell lines (c-Cbl+, c-Cbl , and vector control)
to differentiate in response to RA was measured using a cell surface
marker and a functional differentiation marker. First, a cell surface
differentiation marker, CD11b, was used to measure cell differentiation by immunofluorescence using APC-conjugated CD11b
antibody. We compared CD11b expression in vector control,
c-Cbl+, and c-Cbl cells as well as previously derived (27) CD38
stable transfectants treated with RA for 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours
using flow cytometry. Compared with vector controls, c-Cbl+
cells with RA treatment showed enhanced expression of CD11b
(P < 0.05, at 24, 48, and 72 hours); however, the loss of c-Cbl led to
diminished CD11b expression (P V 0.005, from 24 to 96 hours;
Fig. 2A), indicating that c-Cbl promoted differentiation. c-Cbl
expression increased the rate of RA-induced CD11b expression
from 24 to 96 hours. For example, in c-Cbl+ stable transfectants,
CD11b expression was the same as that in vector controls after

A), CD38 (72 h; B ), CD38 (10 h; C), and h-actin (D ) expression in vector control,

extracted from different cells were probed with anti-c-Cbl, anti-CD38, and
anti-h-actin. h-Actin (D) and Ponceau S stain (E) were used to check uniform
loading of protein lysates at 10 and 72 h, respectively. The blots verified c-Cbl
overexpression and knockdown, and the Western blot also showed that for
RA-treated cells, there was more CD38 in c-Cbl+ and less CD38 in c-Cbl
knockdowns compared with vector controls.

96 hours (97.6% in Cbl+, 94.7% in vector), but there was 1.6-fold
higher expression after 24 hours (42.7% in Cbl+, 27.0% in vector).
This suggested that c-Cbl enhanced the rate of CD11b expression
under RA treatment, speeding up induced differentiation. In
knockdown transfectant cells, RA induced much less CD11b at
an early time point (24 hours, 15% in knockdown, 27% in vector);
however, the expression level continued to increase toward that in
vector control at a later time point (96 hours, 77.6% in knockdown,
94.7% in vector). This suggested that knockdown cells expressed
CD11b more slowly, and c-Cbl was rate limiting for induced differentiation. To compare the CD11b expression in c-Cbl and CD38
stable transfectants, we measured CD11b expression in CD38 stable
transfectants too. Figure 2A shows that CD38 enhanced RAinduced CD11b expression and that the enhanced expression levels
were not significantly different from that in c-Cbl transfectants.
To confirm the regulation of RA-induced cell differentiation by
c-Cbl, a functional differentiation marker, inducible oxidative
metabolism was used. The oxidation of the nonfluorescent
H2DCFDA to the highly fluorescent 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF) was used to detect the generation of reactive oxygen.
Inducible oxidative metabolism can be used as a functional marker
of mature myeloid and monocytic cells. Figure 2B shows that c-Cbl
accelerated HL-60 RA-induced functional differentiation. The
difference between c-Cbl transfectants and vector controls was
obvious and significant after RA treatment for 48 hours (56% in
transfectants, 20% in vector controls; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the
c-Cbl knockdown cells showed reduced RA-induced functional
differentiation, which was consistent with effects on CD11b
expression. We also measured and compared the percentage of
DCF-positive cells in RA-treated CD38 transfectants, and the data
showed that there was no significant difference between responses
achieved by c-Cbl and CD38 stable transfectants. Our data were
consistent with studies by Lamkin and colleagues (27), indicating
that CD38 enhanced RA-induced myeloid differentiation.
To test how ectopically expressing both c-Cbl and CD38 affects
RA-induced cell differentiation, we created c-Cbl/CD38 doublestable transfectants. The double transfectants were done by
transfecting a CD38 expression vector into c-Cbl stable transfectant
cells. Interestingly, the highest sustainable ectopic expression levels
of CD38 in c-Cbl/CD38 double trasfectants were significantly
greater than wt cells but significantly lower than that in CD38
stable transfectants, indicating that c-Cbl overexpression diminished achievable CD38 overexpression (Fig. 2C). The results suggest
the possibility of an interaction between c-Cbl and CD38. Figure 2D
shows that c-Cbl/CD38 double transfectants had enhanced RAinduced functional differentiation, and the response was not
different from that in c-Cbl or CD38 transfectants. We also
measured CD11b expression and compared c-Cbl, CD38, and c-Cbl/
CD38 transfectants. Consistent with the DCF functional differentiation, the induced CD11b expression in c-Cbl/CD38 double
transfectants was similar to that in c-Cbl or CD38 single
transfectants (data not shown). The lack of enhanced differentiation for c-Cbl/CD38 double transfectants compared with the c-Cbl
and CD38 single transfectants may in part reflect the decreased
expression of CD38 in c-Cbl/CD38 transfectants.
c-Cbl accelerated G0 arrest and enhanced ERK activation in
RA-treated cells. To determine the effects of c-Cbl on RA-induced
G1-G0 cell cycle arrest, the percentage of cells (vector, c-Cbl+,
c-Cbl , and CD38) in G1-G0 was measured using flow cytometry
(Fig. 3A). G1-G0 arrest would be revealed by an enrichment
of cells with G1 DNA. c-Cbl overexpression enhanced G0 arrest

on RA treatment, whereas c-Cbl knockdown transfectants
diminished induced G0 arrest. This was consistent with the
results obtained from the differentiation assays, indicating the role
of c-Cbl in promoting RA-induced differentiation and cell
cycle arrest.
It is known that ERK activation is a necessary contributor to
propulsion of RA-induced cell differentiation and cell cycle
arrest (6). To investigate if RA-induced myeloid differentiation
and cell cycle arrest promoted by c-Cbl were related to ERK
activation, we compared ERK expression among vector control,
c-Cbl+, c-Cbl , and CD38 stable transfectant cells. Dual pERK
[T(203) EY(205)] was measured by flow cytometry. The
percentage of cells expressing activated ERK in excess of basal
levels is reported as a measure of the shift of the flow

cytometrically measured histogram of activated ERK per cell.
Figure 3B shows that the amount of activated ERK per cell was
increased by ectopic c-Cbl expression and diminished by c-Cbl
knockdowns, suggesting that the loss of c-Cbl led to diminished
ERK expression and overexpression of c-Cbl caused ERK
activation, which accelerates cell differentiation and cell cycle
arrest. The amount of activated ERK was increased by
RA treatment and by overexpression of CD38 as previously
reported (27). To confirm the flow cytometric measurements,
Western blotting of pERK was performed for the same cases.
The results from Western blots were consistent with flow
cytometric data (Fig. 3C), indicating that cells treated with RA
and cells ectopically expressing c-Cbl or CD38 had enhanced
ERK activation.

c-Cbl and CD38 enhanced the expression of each other.

by RA, and its expression causes MAPK signaling and propels

with hypotonic propidium iodine staining solution were analyzed by flow
cytometry. The different letters indicate significant difference at the P V 0.05

Enhancement was measured as a positive shift of the histogram above basal

latter traits are suggestively similar to the capabilities of c-Cbl. To
reveal potential interaction between c-Cbl and CD38, the effect of
expression of either on expression of the other was determined.
To also further characterize the function of c-Cbl in RA-induced
differentiation, the effect of c-Cbl expression on RA-induced CD38
expression in c-Cbl transfectants, knockdown, and vector control
cells was determined. Figure 4A and B showed that for RA-treated
cells, there was more CD38 in c-Cbl+ cells and less CD38 in c-Cbl
knockdowns compared with vector controls, indicating that enhanced c-Cbl expression increased the rate of RA-induced CD38
expression, but in knockdowns, this effect was lost. By 24 hours,
all cells had attained similar maximal expression. c-Cbl expression
thus regulated the rate of RA-induced CD38 expression. Western
blots (Fig. 1) confirmed the CD38 expression shown by flow
cytometry, indicating that the maximal expression of CD38 per cell
was higher in c-Cbl transfectants.
To determine if a reciprocal regulation of c-Cbl by CD38 existed,
CD38 stable transfectants created as previously described (27) were
analyzed. Western blots verified that the CD38 stable transfectant
expressed enhanced constitutive and RA-induced CD38 expression
(Fig. 4C). The CD38 stable transfectants showed enhanced c-Cbl
expression in untreated cells as well as RA-treated (48 hours) cells.
CD38 expression thus enhanced c-Cbl expression. There was thus
reciprocal enhancement of expression of c-Cbl and CD38,
suggesting the possibility of interaction.
Confirmation of the interaction between c-Cbl and CD38.
c-Cbl has been shown to form complexes with different proteins.
Although Kontani and colleagues (20) showed that CD38 caused
tyrosine phosphorylation of target molecules, including the c-Cbl
adaptor, there was no demonstration of direct interaction of c-Cbl
and CD38. To determine if there is a direct interaction between
c-Cbl and CD38, we used immunoprecipitation and FRET to
characterize c-Cbl and CD38 interaction.
First, we isolated proteins from HL-60 and CD38 stable
transfectant cells to determine if c-Cbl and CD38 coimmunoprecipitated. Coimmunoprecipitation using anti-c-Cbl antibody pulled
down c-Cbl protein (Fig. 5A). CD38 protein coimmunoprecipitated
with c-Cbl protein in HL-60 cells treated with 1 Amol/L RA to
induce CD38 expression and also in HL-60 cells stably transfected
with CD38. In both cases, CD38 coimmunoprecipitated with c-Cbl.
As expected, no immunoprecipitable CD38 occurred in untreated
HL-60 cells, which do not express CD38. Negative controls using
IgG as an isotype-specific control were included and did not
immunoprecipitate c-Cbl or CD38 (data not shown).
Second, we also used FRET to corroborate the interaction of
CD38 and c-Cbl. FRET is a mechanism by which energy is
transferred directly from one molecule to another and can be used
to monitor protein-protein interactions in intact cells (33). c-Cbl
and CD38 were used as donor and acceptor for measuring FRET
emission. HL-60 cells RA untreated (control) or treated were used.
RA induced a FRET emission in RA-treated but not untreated cells,
which do not express CD38. FRET signals were observed after
24 and 48 hours of RA treatment; however, the FRET signal was lost
after 72 hours of RA treatment (Fig. 5C and D). There was thus an
interaction between CD38 and Cbl after 24 or 48 hours of RA
treatment; however, this interaction was lost after 72 hours. FRET
measurements made in reciprocal experiments with a CD38 donor
and c-Cbl acceptor gave similar results (data not shown). To show
the interaction of c-Cbl and CD38 in another RA-responsive
leukemia cell line, we measured CD38 expression and CD38-Cbl
FRET signal in NB4 cells. Our data show that CD38 was induced by

expression compared with vector control cells. The expression levels were significantly different after 12 h of RA treatment (P V 0.003). Cells were stained with
PE-conjugated anti-CD38 antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. The different letters indicate significant differences between groups. C, Western blots of c-Cbl (top ),

enhanced. Protein lysates were extracted from wt HL-60 and CD38 overexpression cell lines and probed with anti-c-Cbl, anti-CD38, and anti-h-actin.

RA in NB4 cells and that the inducible CD38 levels were the same
compared with HL-60 cells (Fig. 5B). Figure 5C shows that the
FRET signal was observed in both HL-60 and NB4 cells, indicating
an interaction of c-Cbl and CD38.
Loss of the FRET emission at 72 hours suggests possible loss
of one of the partners either CD38 or c-Cbl. Previous studies
(27) indicated that CD38 expression was induced by RA treatment and persisted in all RA-treated cells. The results thus
predict the potential loss of c-Cbl expression in RA-treated
cells after 72 hours. To determine the effects of RA on c-Cbl
expression in HL-60 cells, we tested c-Cbl expression on treatment with 1 Amol/L RA with Western blots and flow cytometry.
Figure 6A shows that RA caused the gradual down-regulation and
eventual loss of c-Cbl expression. Flow cytometric data (Fig. 6B
and C) were consistent with Western blots, indicating that RA
down-regulated c-Cbl expression. The expression level of c-Cbl
diminished after 48 hours of RA treatment and was not detected
on 72 hours of RA treatment (data not shown). Thus, loss of
c-Cbl expression resulted in loss of FRET signal after 72 hours

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

of treatment. This corroborates the FRET conclusions and suggests that c-Cbl–dependent signaling is not needed in cells that
are differentiated, as are almost all cells in the population after
72 hours of RA treatment.

Discussion
c-Cbl plays an important role in signal transduction in hematopoietic cells and can drive apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells
(34–36). Consistent with one of the apparent biological roles of
Cbl proteins as negative regulators of protein tyrosine kinases
(11, 12, 36), their use as anticancer tools has been studied. Although
Cbl proteins have known biological roles in terms of their adaptor
function and E3 ligase activity, the precise role of c-Cbl in cell
differentiation and cell growth still remains to be elucidated. This
study is the first to show the role of c-Cbl in regulating differentiation and cell cycle arrest of myeloblastic leukemia cells. We have
created HL-60 sublines where c-Cbl was overexpressed or knocked
down, and investigated the effect of c-Cbl expression on RA-induced

expression of different differentiation markers. Our studies showed
that c-Cbl overexpression caused enhanced ERK2 activation.
Enhanced c-Cbl expression enhanced RA-induced CD11b and
CD38 expression, and diminished c-Cbl expression diminished
induced expression of these cellular surface antigens. c-Cbl also
accelerated RA-induced functional differentiation using inducible
oxidative metabolism as a functional marker. We have found that
c-Cbl activated ERK expression, drove MAPK signaling, and
promoted cell differentiation. We also found that c-Cbl overexpression enhanced G0 arrest on RA treatment, whereas c-Cbl
knockdown cells decreased RA-induced G0 arrest, indicating that
c-Cbl regulates cell growth. This, along with the results from the
differentiation assays, indicates a role for c-Cbl in promoting
RA-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest.

More interestingly, our results clearly indicated the interaction of
c-Cbl and CD38 using independent techniques. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blots showed that c-Cbl protein associated
with CD38 and enhanced CD38 expression, and also that CD38
drove c-Cbl expression by observing CD38 expression in c-Cbl
stable transfectants and knockdown cell lines and c-Cbl expression
in CD38 stable transfectants. We confirmed the interaction of Cbl
and CD38 by using FRET techniques in both HL-60 and NB4 cells.
From the FRET studies, we found that the intensity of FRET signals
depended on the amount of c-Cbl expressed. The loss of c-Cbl
(after 72 hours of RA treatment) resulted in loss of FRET signals,
suggesting that the c-Cbl/CD38 interaction was governed by the
amount of c-Cbl available. This was consistent with the results
from FRET experiments when using high CD38–expressing and low

c-Cbl and CD38 was confirmed by

CD38–expressing transfectant cell lines to observe FRET signals
(data not shown). From these experiments, we found that FRET
signals did not differ between high and low CD38 expression
cell lines, suggesting that the interaction depended more on the
amount of c-Cbl than on the amount of CD38. There clearly is an
interaction between CD38 and c-Cbl; however, it is not yet clear how
CD38 and c-Cbl work together in accelerating cell differentiation and
cell cycle arrest. One possibility is that their interaction stabilizes
each other to promote a signaling complex that uses MAPK
signaling, which each has been observed to enhance. CD38 might
also sequester c-Cbl and mitigate its reported negative regulatory
activity via its E3 ligase activity.
HL-60 cells undergo myeloid differentiation in response to RA
(4, 5). In this process, RA induces the early expression of CD38, which
activates ERK expression and drives MAPK signaling needed to
promote cell differentiation. This study determined that RA
gradually down-regulated c-Cbl expression in HL-60 cell lines, with
eventual loss of Cbl expression in differentiated cells. Thus far, three
mammalian homologues (c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3) have been
characterized; all of which are oncoproteins by virtue of their
prominent role in regulating signal transduction (37). Studies by
Pennock and Wang (38) have indicated that Cbl plays a role in downregulation and trafficking of important mitogenic cell surface
receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). More
interestingly, c-Cbl showed its strongest interaction with EGFR at an
early stage of EGFR trafficking, whereas the association of Cbl-b with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

EGFR occurred at a later stage. Both c-Cbl and Cbl-b binding was
associated with EGFR ubiquitination. c-Cbl and Cbl-b may thus have
both redundant and differential functions. c-Cbl and Cbl-b are
structurally similar, and both were expressed in HL-60 cells (39, 40).
In this study, we focused on c-Cbl. It is not known how expression
levels of Cbl-b are affected when RA gradually down-regulated c-Cbl
expression in HL-60 cell lines, but it is possible that Cbl-b may
potentially perform a compensatory role when c-Cbl was lost during
the late stages of RA-induced differentiation.
c-Cbl is an adaptor molecule that interacts with a plethora of
proteins and has been shown to positively influence certain
biological processes (34, 41). The multidomain nature of c-Cbl
allows it to interact with many crucial signaling molecules, including
kinases, adaptors, and structural proteins, via its various domains
(13, 21, 42). It is well documented that c-Cbl is capable of binding to
the SH3 domain of Fyn, Lck, and Grb-2 NH2 termini as well as
interacting with Src family tyrosine kinases, GTPase-activating
protein, and phospholipase Cg via SH2 domains (8, 43). This suggests
that c-Cbl protein is a prominent substrate of tyrosine kinases in T
cells and may have significant functions in signaling cascades or
networks. The discovery of novel partners of c-Cbl is important to an
understanding of c-Cbl protein function. In this study, we highlight
the interaction of Cbl and CD38. The evidence from differentiation
and CD38 interaction experiments showed that c-Cbl enhanced
CD38 expression and more CD38 or c-Cbl promoted cell differentiation and cell cycle arrest in HL-60 cell lines. Taken together, the

c-Cbl Interacts with CD38 and Promotes Differentiation

data suggest that the process of RA-induced differentiation can be
propelled by both c-Cbl and CD38, both of which bind together,
enhance the expression of each other, and cause ERK2 activation and
MAPK signaling. This suggests a cooperative role for c-Cbl and CD38
in propulsion of RA-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest.
Clearly, future work on understanding what domains of c-Cbl are
responsible for the interaction and how c-Cbl proteins interact
with CD38 or other proteins is now of interest. Studies by Sanjay
and colleagues (9) indicated that the Src homology domain 3
domain-binding sites in c-Cbl play a functionally significant role in
Src- and Cbl-dependent signaling mechanism, and the c-Cbl
RDLPPPP (540-546) sequence contributes to a Src-binding site.
More importantly, the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl presents the
most conserved region among Cbl family proteins, and it is
implicated as an important element in the function of Cbl
proteins (8, 11, 44). Mutations spanning the Ring finger abolish
c-Cbl–directed polyubiquitination and down-regulation of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases (45). The present data
