(NNBC) has increased greatly in the last decade (1–5). Despite
recent consensus, the number of patients with NNBC that will
obtain clinical benefit from the use of adjuvant chemotherapy is
still a problematic debate. In young patients with large sized or
high pathologic grade tumors, or with hormone receptor–
negative tumors, systemic chemotherapy improves the odds of
disease-free and overall survival (1, 2, 5, 6). Among the different
chemotherapy regimens, those containing anthracyclines are, on
average, more effective (5, 6). Therapy with trastuzumab seems
to be effective in the subset of HER2-positive NNBC (7).
However, despite obvious therapeutic advances, approximately
one fourth of the patients with NNBC will have tumor recurrence
that is potentially treatable but ultimately fatal. These data
highlight the need for more sensitive and specific therapypredictive indicators to refine the use of multiple treatment
options.
Using gene expression profiling, several investigators have
reported gene expression signatures of breast tumor cells that
were more powerful predictors of disease outcome than standard
clinical and histologic criteria (8–12). However, the apparent
variability and lack of reproducibility observed among these
previous transcriptional analyses and the requirements for highquality RNA obtained from fresh tissues have limited their
application to the clinical setting. A different type of microarray
technology, termed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to
microarrays (array CGH), allows a quantitative detection of DNA
copy number changes in tumor genomes with high resolution
(13, 14). This method enables the identification of precise areas in
which genetic changes occur, including loss of genomic material
(deletion) and genomic gain (amplification). These genomic
alterations usually result in the damage of specific genes involved
in cancer development and progression. In breast cancer, the
definition of recurrent genomic aberrations has revealed loci
encoding genes involved in the pathogenesis of the disease (15–20),
some of which have been correlated with different pathologic
subtypes (21). As the most prominent example, amplification of
chromosome 17q12 targets the HER2 gene, which results in
deregulation at the RNA and protein levels (22). Recently, array
CGH has also proven its value for predicting clinical outcome in
prostate carcinoma, lymphoma, and gastric carcinoma (23–25).
However, to date, no similar studies have been attempted in breast
cancer.
In the present study, we examined the feasibility of developing a
predictor of recurrence risk and therapeutic response for 185
patients with NNBC, using array CGH for scanning the entire
genome for DNA copy number changes.

Abstract
Despite the recent consensus on the eligibility of adjuvant
systemic therapy in patients with lymph node–negative breast
cancer (NNBC) based on clinicopathologic criteria, specific
biological markers are needed to predict sensitivity to the
different available therapeutic options. We examined the feasibility of developing a genomic predictor of chemotherapy
response and recurrence risk in 185 patients with NNBC using
assembled arrays containing 2,460 bacterial artificial chromosome clones for scanning the genome for DNA copy number
changes. After surgery, 90 patients received anthracyclinebased chemotherapy, whereas 95 did not. Tamoxifen was administered to patients with hormone receptor–positive tumors.
The association of genomic and clinicopathologic data and
outcome was computed using Cox proportional hazard models
and multiple testing adjustment procedures. Analysis of NNBC
genomes revealed a common genomic signature. Specific DNA
copy number aberrations were associated with hormonal
receptor status, but not with other clinicopathologic variables.
In patients treated with chemotherapy, none of the genomic
changes were significantly correlated with recurrence. In
patients not receiving chemotherapy, deletion of eight bacterial artificial chromosome clones clustered to chromosome 11q
was independently associated with relapse (disease-free survival at 10 years F SE, 40% F 14% versus 86% F 6%; P < 0.0001).
The 54 patients with deletion of 11q (29%) did not present more
aggressive clinicopathologic features than those without 11q
loss. The adverse influence of 11q deletion on clinical outcome
was confirmed in an independent validation series of 88
patients with NNBC. Our data suggests that patients with NNBC
with the 11q deletion might benefit from anthracycline-based
chemotherapy despite other clinical, pathologic, or genetic
features. However, these initial findings should be evaluated
in randomized clinical trials. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):818–26]

receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status were determined
following standard methods previously reported (26). Human investigations were done after approval by an institutional review board on
scientific and ethical affairs.

Materials and Methods
Study Design and Selection of Patients
From September 1979 to June 2000, >3,100 new breast cancer patients
were diagnosed at the University of Valencia. From these patients, 1,482
tumors were cryopreserved at 80jC. For this study, biopsies were
randomly selected based on the following criteria for inclusion: (a)
diagnosis of primary invasive breast carcinoma of any size; (b) treatment
by modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, including
dissection of axillary lymph nodes, followed by radiotherapy if indicated;
(c) the apical axillary lymph nodes were tumor-negative (pathologic
examination, pN0); and (d) complete clinical data were available. More
than 363 samples fulfilled the criteria. Previous to DNA extraction, these
frozen tumor sections stained by H&E and reviewed for tumor infiltration:
only samples that showed clearly >50% tumor cells were selected.
A cohort of 185 patients fulfilled these final criteria. Clinicopathologic
variables including tumor size, histologic grade and subtype, and estrogen

DNA extraction, hybridization, and imaging. Frozen tumors were
included in ornithine carbamyl transferase compound. Prior to DNA
extraction, H&E-stained tumor sections were examined to select samples
with >50% tumor cells. Approximately 20 to 30 sections of 25 Am were used
for DNA extraction. After removing the ornithine carbamyl transferase with
PBS washes, DNA was extracted as described previously (26). Genome-wide
analyses of DNA copy number changes were done using array CGH on a
microchip with f2,460 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and P1
clones printed in triplicate (UCSF Hum Array 2.0) with a resolution of 1.4
Mb across the genome (27). Methods and analytic procedures have been
described in detail elsewhere (refs. 27–29; Fig. 1). For visualization of

Figure 1. Representation and description of genome-wide array CGH technique. Genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number changes were done using array CGH
on a microchip with f2,460 BAC and P1 clones printed in triplicate. Briefly, 0.5 Ag of test (tumor) and reference genomic DNAs were labeled by random priming
using Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. After 48 h of hybridization, slides were washed and mounted with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The images of the arrays were
captured using a CCD camera, and the ‘‘UCSF SPOT’’ 2.0 software (available at http://www.jainlab.org/downloads.html) was used to analyze the images and
measure tumoral versus control fluorescence intensity ratios that were converted to the log 2 scale. A second program, the ‘‘UCSF SPROC,’’ was used to associate
clones with each spot and to create a mapping information file that allows the data to be plotted relative to the position of the BACs on the draft human genome
sequence (http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu; May 2004 freeze). A formal data-filtering procedure was then done, and a SPROC output file consisting of the averaged ratios
of the triplicate spots for each clone, SDs of the replicates, and plotting positions for each clone on the array, was obtained.

clone. The array CGH data were then analyzed using a hidden Markov
model using the Bioconductor package aCGH. Log 2 ratios, as ordered in
the genome, were segmented into regions of constant copy number. In
addition, the hidden Markov model was employed to impute missing
values by using the estimated copy number ratio for the segment
containing the clone(s) with missing values. Clones with missing values
located between segmented regions were assigned the mean value of the
segment that was closer in genomic distance. Thus, each clone was
assigned a segment value referred to as its ‘‘smoothed’’ value. The median
absolute deviation (MAD) of the difference between the observed and
smoothed values was used to estimate the tumor-specific experimental
variation. Clones for each array were assigned into three groups: gained
(smoothed log 2 ratio more than thrice the MAD), lost (smoothed log 2
ratio less than thrice the MAD), and not changed (the log 2 ratio could not
be assigned to lost or gained groups). Smoothed data was used to study the
association with the following phenotypes: age, tumor size, histologic grade
and subtype, stage, ER and PR status, and recurrence/survival. Finally, we
used Fisher’s two-sided exact test 2  2 cross-tabs to compare genomic

genomic data, the TreeView program 1.60 (Stanford, CA) was used. To
confirm array CGH data, CGH to chromosomes was done in 44 of the
biopsies included in this study.
Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. To confirm
specific gains and losses of BAC clones observed in the array CGH analyses,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using individual BAC
clones as probes on isolated nuclei from frozen tumor sections were done
using a previously reported technique (30). The gene loci examined
corresponded to five overrepresented and four deleted BAC clones, using
appropriate centromeric probes as controls. A total of 100 cells were
examined on each of the 22 tumors examined. These clones were obtained
from RZPD German Resource Center (Berlin, Germany) or purchased from
Vysis (Downers Grove, IL).

Statistical Data Analysis
To process the genomic data obtained with array CGH, we used a
previously described analytic model (19, 31). Arrays were normalized by
subtracting the median of each array from the average log 2 ratio for every

events or clinical variables among both groups of treatment. To evaluate
differences in disease-free survival (DFS), Kaplan-Maier survival curves for
the sets of patients were examined.
Gene ontology classification. Gene ontology (GO) was used to
construct a unified and structured vocabulary for the description of genes
and their products in any organism. A GO term is descriptive of the
molecular function, biological process, or cellular component. We then did
a statistical analysis to check if there were any GO categories that were
enriched in the genes located in the region of deletion in chromosome
11q23-q24 with respect to the whole genome.

Clinical Series for Validation of Array CGH Results
To validate the possible association of chromosome 11q deletion with
increased relapse rate, this was tested in a validation group of 88 tumor
biopsy samples from an independent cohort of patients with NNBC: 18
Spanish patients, treated in different institutions within the Valencia area,
whose genomes were analyzed with array CGH as described above. In
addition, data from 70 patients were obtained from a recently published
series of American patients with breast cancer who were analyzed using
similar whole-genome array CGH techniques. All patients fulfilled the
inclusion criteria reported for this study. Kaplan-Maier survival curves for
the two sets of patients were evaluated. Clinicopathologic characteristics of
the validation series are shown in Supplemental Table S1.

Results
Characteristics of the patients. The clinicopathologic characteristics of the 185 patients and tumors are summarized in Table 1.
Based on the clinicopathologic features, 90 women received
anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CHEMO group) whereas 95
patients did not (non-CHEMO group). In both groups, women with
ER/PR-positive tumors were treated with tamoxifen: 42 in the
CHEMO group (47%) and 56 in the non-CHEMO group (59%;
Supplemental Table S2). With a median duration of follow-up time
of 82 months (range, 9-218 months), 45 of the 185 patients (24%)
had relapsed. Median duration of follow-up time for patients who
were free of disease was 96 months in both CHEMO and nonCHEMO groups. Death from the disease was assessed in 16 of 185
patients (9%). We initially determined differences in clinicopathologic features and outcome between patients in the CHEMO
group versus those in the non-CHEMO group. Women in the
CHEMO group were younger (mean, 51 versus 67 years; P = 0.003)
and had a more frequent premenopausal status (43% versus 17%;
P = 0.001). We did not observe statistically significant differences in
any other histopathologic feature (Table 1; Supplemental Fig. S1A).
In addition, no statistically significant differences in DFS and
overall survival were found between CHEMO and non-CHEMO
groups (Supplemental Fig. S1B and C).
Genomic profiling of NNBC. Array CGH analysis was done in
the 185 tumor biopsies, and allowed the identification of specific
regions of gain and loss throughout the genome with high
resolution in all of the biopsies. All tumors showed genomic
changes (Fig. 2). A total of 112 clones that were mapped to 40
different chromosome loci in 9 different chromosome arms were
found. These corresponded to 23 genomic gains and 17 genomic
losses involving regions known to be commonly involved in breast
cancer as well as uncharacterized genomic aberrations. The most
common gains corresponded to chromosomes 1q31 and 20q12 (91
of 185, 49%), 8q24.2 (40%), 17q21 (39%), 1q32, 8q23.1 and 20q13.1
(35%), 1q23 (34%), and 8q24.1 at the MYC gene locus (32%). In
addition, high-level amplification (defined as log 2 ratio >1
observed in at least 10 different samples) was identified in five
different regions of chromosomes 11q13-q14 at the CCND1 gene

(17 of 185 tumors, 9%), HER2 (13 tumors, 7%), 1q31 and 8p12 at the
FGFR1 gene (11 tumors, 6%), and 8q21-q24.1 including the MYC
gene (10 tumors, 5%). The most frequently deleted regions were
observed at chromosomes 13q14-q22 (66 of 185 tumors, 36%),
17p12-p13 including the P53 gene locus (34%), 16q21-q22 including
the CDH1 gene (30%), and 11q23-q24 (29%), 16q24 and 16p12-p13.1
(26%), 11q12 (25%), 8p21.3-p22 (25%), and 22q11.2. A total of 18
homozygous deletions (defined as log 2 ratio < 1.4) were
identified, being the loss of 13q21.3-q22 at KLF12 gene observed
in two different tumors. The full array CGH data has been
deposited in the GEO database (Platform GPL3632).
To initially validate the array CGH results, a subset of 44 samples
was also analyzed with CGH to chromosomes, and the two
techniques showed concordant values (Supplemental Fig. S2). To
further validate our data, the analysis of nine individual BAC clones
in 22 frozen tumor sections using FISH also showed a high
concordance with array CGH results (Supplemental Table S3). The
array CGH data defined a common genomic signature of NNBC
(Fig. 2; detailed information in Supplemental Table S4).
Correlation of genomic alterations and clinicopathologic
features. We tested the association of clinical and pathologic
variables with each of the BAC clones in the 185 patients. After
adjustment for multiple testing, these analyses showed that the
only variables correlated with genomic changes were ER and PR
status (Fig. 3). Tumors that showed expression of ER (ER+)
presented with frequent gain of chromosomes 1q21-q43 (35%
versus 14%; P < 0.05), and 16p12 (17% versus 1%; P < 0.01) and

(Fig. 4A). In the non-CHEMO group, however, there were
statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in eight BAC clones
that showed more common deletions in tumor recurrences with
respect to nonrecurrences (Fig. 4B). Notably, these eight clones
clustered to the long arm of chromosome 11 from 11q23.1 to
11q24.1, spanning f9 Mb in size (Fig. 4C). Therefore, deletion of
chromosome 11q was associated with decreased DFS in patients
with NNBC in the non-CHEMO group (DFS F SE at 10 years, 40%
F 14% versus 86% F 6%; P < 0.0001) but not in the CHEMO
group (DFS at 10 years F SE, 92% F 21% versus 65% F 9%;
P = 0.13). Analyses of the association of the genomic changes
with overall survival in the two treatment cohorts did not reveal
any significant correlation, probably due to the low number of
patients who have thus far died of the disease. Finally, we did a
statistical analysis to check if there were any GO categories that
were enriched in the genes located in the region of deletion in
chromosome 11q23.1-q24.1. Among them, DNA repair genes and
meiotic-related genes were significantly enriched (hypergeometric
test, P < 0.00092). Four genes belonged to this category (CHK1,
H2A, ATM, and ZW10). These data may suggest that deletion of
chromosome 11q targets the gene(s) involved in DNA repair; thus,
possibly contributing to the increased sensitivity to anthracyclines
identified in our study.
Characteristics of patients with 11q deletions. To determine
whether the negative effect of 11q deletion on DFS was dependent

losses of chromosome 16q21-q24 (25% versus 7%; P < 0.01).
Tumors negative for PR (PR ) also presented with frequent
deletion of chromosomes 4p13-p16 (19% versus 5%; P < 0.001)
and 5q11.2-q31 (16% versus 3%; P < 0.001; Fig. 3B; Supplemental
Table S5). In addition, tumors negative for ER displayed a similar
genomic profile than PR tumors, including deletions of 4p and
5q; however, after statistical adjustments, these changes were not
statistically significant (Fig. 3C). We also determined the
correlation of the genomic status of the 17q12 locus at the
HER2 gene (determined by array CGH analysis) with other clinical
variables. Amplification or gain of HER2 gene was observed in 29
tumors (16%) and was correlated with negativity for PR
expression (P = 0.007), but not with other clinicopathologic
features.
Association of genomic abnormalities with clinical outcome: 11q loss may predict response to chemotherapy. We
compared the genomic profiles of tumors in the CHEMO and
non-CHEMO groups. None of the abnormal BAC clones showed a
significantly different distribution between the two cohorts,
indicating that both groups were comparable at the genomic
level (Fig. 2). To develop a genomic predictor of clinical outcome,
we examined the association of the genomic aberrations with
disease recurrence in the two differently treated cohorts. In the
CHEMO group, after adjustment for multiple testing, none of
the abnormal BAC clones were associated with tumor relapse

abnormalities of the 1q, 16p, or 16q arms, but a borderline significance in chromosome 16 was observed. Instead, the genomic loss of clones mapped to 4p13-16

Figure 4. Association of genomic results with clinical outcome in patients with NNBC. A, in the CHEMO group, after adjustment for multiple testing, none of the 2,460 BAC
clones were associated with tumor relapse. B, in the non-CHEMO group, however, there were statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in eight BAC clones, clustered
to the long arm of chromosome 11, which showed more common deletion in the group of tumor recurrences. Kaplan-Meier curves showed differences in DFS for
11q-deleted tumors versus those without deletion in the non-CHEMO group (DFS F ES at 10 yrs, 40% F 14% versus 86% F 6%; P < 0.0001) but not in the
non-CHEMO group. Considering the patients harboring deletion of chromosome 11q, 5 of 31 patients in the CHEMO group (16%) had recurrence of the disease, whereas
the relapse rate was much higher in the non-CHEMO group: 14 of 23 with 11q deletion (62%) had a relapse (P < 0.0001). Among the 59 patients in the CHEMO
group who did not show deletion of 11q, 19 patients (30%) presented recurrence of the disease, whereas only 8 of 72 patients without the 11q deletion (11%) in the
non-CHEMO group relapsed. C, region of deletion in chromosome 11q. The eight clones clustered to chromosome 11 from bands 11q23.1 to 11q24.1 (yellow ). When the

We did not observe changes in the distribution of these genomic
alterations, with the exception of CCND1 amplification that was
more common in tumors harboring deletion of chromosome 11q:
among 17 cases with CCND1 amplification, 12 (70%) presented
deletion of 11q, whereas only 42 cases (25%) showed 11q deletions

differences for age, clinical stage, hormonal status, tumor size and
grade, and expression of ER/PR for 11q-deleted versus nondeleted

influence of 11q deletions in the relapse rate of the patients in the
non-CHEMO group is independent of other known clinical and
pathologic features. We also analyzed possible differences in

11q Deletion in Early Breast Cancer

drugs (32). We may speculate that deletion of chromosome 11q in
breast tumor cells leads to functional impairment of the gene(s)
involved in DNA repair, thus, contributing to the increased
sensitivity to anthracyclines. Indeed, we have observed that genes
involved in DNA repair were enriched in the deleted 11q region
with respect to the rest of the genome. Two of the most
prominent candidate targets for 11q deletion in breast cancer are
(a) the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene ATM which codifies for
a protein involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control (33, 34),
and (b) the cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK1 which acts
downstream of ATM in response to DNA damage (35). Other
candidate targets include the gene encoding for the H2AFX
histone, which is critical for facilitating the assembly of specific
DNA-repair complexes on damaged DNA (36); and the gene
encoding for the mitotic checkpoint protein ZW10 (37). In this
theoretical scenario, 11q-deleted tumor cells that become deficient
for these DNA repair genes cannot detect and/or repair DNA
damage induced by anthracyclines, whereas tumor cells with
intact chromosome 11q and functional DNA repair proteins are
able to repair DNA efficiently, evade apoptosis, and ultimately
metastasize. We may also suggest that deletion of 11q targets the
noncoding micro-RNA gene miR125b-1, which is specifically
down-regulated in breast cancer and may potentially regulate
oncogenes such as ETS1, which plays a role in cell growth and has
been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancer (38). Ongoing
genetic and functional studies will try to define the damaged
genes of chromosome 11q that are responsible for the anthracycline-resistant tumor phenotype.
Finally, our study could be valuable in the clinical management of patients with NNBC, by adding the 11q deletion status
to the currently accepted prognostic and therapy-predictive
markers (4). According to our data, tumors should be screened
for the presence or absence of 11q deletion at diagnosis using
rapid quantitative PCR, FISH, and/or mini-array CGH devices
using a reduced set of BAC clones. These diagnostic tests should
allow clinicians to prospectively identify patients who are
candidates to receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy, such
as standard AC/FAC, which are widely used as front-line
therapies in NNBC, irrespective of other clinicopathologic
features. We may propose that in patients with NNBC presenting
factors that imply a good prognosis, such as age >35, clinical
stage I, low-grade tumors sized >1 cm, and ER/PR positivity,
systemic chemotherapy could be avoided only if 11q deletion is
not identified. Although our study requires further validation and
refinement in prospective clinical trials, future application of 11q
deletion measurement as a novel therapeutic indicator in NNBC
is clearly challenged.

CCND1 gene (which maps to the 11q13 band) to the 11q23.1-q24.1
deletion (Supplemental Fig. S4B). Notably, genomic amplification
of CCND1 was not associated with decreased DFS in both the
non-CHEMO and CHEMO groups. In summary, tumors with 11q
deletion do not show a more aggressive phenotype or genotype
that can distinguish them from those without this chromosome
deletion.
Validation of 11q deletion as a therapy-predictive indicator.
To validate the association of chromosome 11q deletion with
worse outcome in patients not receiving anthracycline-based
chemotherapy, we analyzed a second series (validation group) of
88 NNBC biopsies (Supplemental Table S1). After surgery, 27 of
the patients received chemotherapy, whereas the 61 remaining
did not. Sixty-two patients with ER/PR-positive expression
received hormonal therapy based on tamoxifen. In the group
treated with chemotherapy, 6 of 15 patients (40%) without an 11q
deletion relapsed, whereas 3 of 12 patients (25%) with an 11q
deletion had a recurrence (P = 0.23). However, in the group not
receiving chemotherapy, tumor recurrence was observed in 4 of
33 patients (12%) without an 11q deletion and in 10 of 28
patients (35%) with an 11q deletion (P = 0.02; Fig. 5). KaplanMeier curves also showed that deletion of chromosome 11q was
associated with inferior DFS in patients not treated with
chemotherapy (DFS F SE at 10 years, 65% F 13% versus
88% F 8%; P < 0.1). Notably, in the CHEMO group, patients with
an 11q deletion had a tendency to show a superior DFS
compared with those without 11q loss (73% F 18% versus
50% F 18%; P < 0.7). These differences, however, did not reach
statistically significant values, probably because of the limited
number of patients and the relatively short median follow-up
time (Fig. 5D). In summary, the results observed in this validation
set were coincident with those obtained in the training set of 185
patients, and confirm that deletion of 11q was associated with
relapse in patients with NNBC who did not receive anthracyclinebased chemotherapy.

Discussion
An alteration in the DNA copy number is one of the many ways
in which gene expression and function may be modified. In
cancer, these gains and losses of genomic material frequently
disrupt genes implicated in the development and progression of
the disease. Array CGH enables the detection of these genomic
aberrations with high-resolution (13, 15, 19, 20, 25, 29). In this
exploratory study, we used genome-wide array CGH to study a
series of patients with breast cancer. Our initial data suggest that
patients with NNBC with the 11q deletion may benefit from
anthracycline-based chemotherapy despite other clinical, pathologic, or genetic features. Thus, loss of chromosome 11q may
make tumor cells more responsive to anthracycline-based
chemotherapy through a currently unknown mechanism. Theoretically, adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is administered to the
patients to kill any remaining malignant cells after surgical
removal of the tumor. Cellular DNA is the primary target for
anthracyclines, by binding and inserting between DNA bases,
leading to chromatin unfolding and aggregation. These chromatin
structural changes primarily interfere with DNA replication and
transcription, thus leading to the apoptosis undergone by the cells
treated with anthracyclines (32). The selectivity of these drugs for
targeting cancer cells, but not nontumoral cells, may reside in the
lower ability of cancer cells to repair the damage induced by the
