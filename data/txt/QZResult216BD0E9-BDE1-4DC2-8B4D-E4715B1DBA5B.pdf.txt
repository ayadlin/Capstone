functional vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes, modified by a targeting molecule
DSPE-PEG2000-c(RGDyK), were fabricated to address this issue. The investigations
were performed on TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-231 xenografts in nude
mice. The liposomes exhibited the superior performances in the following aspects:
the enhancement of cellular uptake via targeted action; the induction of apoptosis via
activation of caspase 8, 9, and 3, increased expression of Bax, decreased expression
of Mcl-1, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); and the deletion of VM
channels via inhibitions on the VM channel indicators, which consisted of vascular
endothelial-cadherin (VE-Cad), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), and matrix metallopeptidases (MMP-2, and MMP-9). Furthermore,
the liposomes displayed the prolonged circulation time in the blood, the increased
accumulation in tumor tissue, and the improved therapeutic efficacy along with
deletion of VM channels in the TNBC-bearing mice. In conclusion, the nanostructured
functional drug-loaded liposomes may provide a promising strategy for the treatment
of invasive TNBC along with deletion of VM channels.

channels are formed by TNBC cells instead of endothelial
cells as an alternative microcirculation pathway, and these
channel-forming TNBC cells are highly drug resistant
[7, 8]. Comprehensive treatments, which consist of
surgery, radiation and standard chemotherapy, cannot
completely eliminate TNBC cells [9, 10]. In hypoxic
conditions, the residual cancer cells readily proliferate
via the formation of highly patterned VM channels,
which provide nutrients to the relapsed cancer cells.
Consequently, the elimination of VM channels plays
a crucial role in a successful treatment of TNBC.
In this study, we hypothesized that functional
vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes could eliminate
TNBC cells along with destroying VM channels. In these
nanostructured liposomes, a cyclic peptide c(RGDyK) was

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common malignant
disease and a major cause of mortality among women
worldwide [1]. Nearly 1.4 million individuals are diagnosed
with breast cancer globally, with more than 450,000 deaths
per year [2]. Among these cases, approximately 15–20% are
characterized as the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
phenotype, namely, the absence of estrogen receptors,
progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 [3, 4]. Patients with TNBC have a very poor
prognosis because TNBC is highly invasive and associated
with a high rate of cancer metastasis and recurrence [5, 6].
In recent years, increasing evidences have indicated
that highly patterned vasculogenic mimicry (VM)

conjugated with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-polyethylene
glycol distearoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DSPEPEG2000-NHS) and used as a targeting molecule to
modify the liposome surface. Vincristine was used as
an anticancer drug, and dasatinib was employed as VM
channel inhibitor.
Vincristine is a cell cycle-specific anticancer agent.
The cytotoxic activity of vincristine is related to its
activities regarding the inhibition of microtubules and the
alteration of tubulin polymerization equilibrium, which
thus causes the arrest of cell division in metaphase [11].
Dasatinib is an inhibitor of sarcoma gene family kinases
(SFKs) [12]. Studies indicate that SFKs play a central role
in multiple signaling pathways that regulate cell adhesion,
invasion and motility, and are also involved in interactions
with numerous breast cancer associated growth factors
[13, 14]. Thus, as an inhibitor of SFKs, dasatinib exhibits
multiple effects on cancer, including anti-proliferative
activity, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of invasion
[15–17]. Because of these properties, dasatinib represents
a promising inhibitor in TNBC treatment.
Conventional chemotherapy has demonstrated
unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties and systemic
toxicities as a result of the direct delivery of free drugs
into the circulatory system [18]. Pegylated liposomes
with suitable particle sizes have been demonstrated to
improve the therapeutic index of drugs by prolonged
circulation in the blood and enhanced tumor accumulation
in cancer tissue due to the enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effects [19, 20]. Besides, the liposomes
are biocompatible and can entrap both hydrophilic and
hydrophobic pharmaceutical agents, protecting them
from external damage and allowing to local concentrated
drug delivery. Therefore, development of a tool to allow
for constant and selective delivery of therapeutics is
desirable. Active targeting was achieved by conjugating
c(RGDyK) with DSPE-PEG2000-NHS and modifying the
liposome surface in this study. C(RGDyK) is a cyclic
peptide that has a specific affinity for the integrin receptor,
which is overexpressed on many malignant cancer cells
[21, 22]. This cyclic peptide offers a potential avenue for
nanostructured drug carriers to access target cancer cells.
The objectives of this study were to fabricate
functional vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes to eliminate
VM channels in the treatment of invasive TNBC and to
define the action mechanism (Figure 1).

flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) spectra of
DSPE-PEG2000-NHS (Figure 2A1) and DSPE-PEG2000c(RGDyK) (Figure 2A2) indicated that the c(RGDyK)
peptide was successfully conjugated to the distal end
of DSPE-PEG2000-NHS via a nucleophilic substitution
reaction. Observation under an atomic force microscope
(AFM) indicated that the liposome was round in shape
with a smooth surface and approximately 100 nm in
diameter (Figure 2B1 and 2B2). The in vitro release rates
of vincristine and dasatinib from the liposomes were
< 3% within the initial 2 h and were < 20% over 24 h
(Figure 2C).
Table 1 lists the characterization of functional
drugs-loaded liposomes. The results indicated that the
average particle sizes of the liposomes were in the range
of 100–107 nm with a narrow polydispersity index
(PDI; ≤ 0.2), and the charge values were slightly negative
(-6 mV). The encapsulation efficiencies of vincristine and
dasatinib were both > 90% in all prepared liposomes.

RESULTS

Figure 4A illustrates the inhibitory effects of free
drugs on MDA-MB-231 cells. Results demonstrated that
free vincristine alone had limited efficacy in inhibiting
MDA-MB-231 cells; in contrast, in the co-treatment
of free vincristine with free dasatinib, the inhibitory
effect of vincristine on the cancer cells was significantly
enhanced in a dasatinib concentration-dependent manner.
Figure 4B demonstrates the inhibitory effects of functional

Cellular uptake by TNBC cells and targeting
effect
To evaluate the cellular uptake by TNBC cells and
targeting effect, the fluorescence probe coumarin was
used to label the liposomes. Figure 3A and 3B indicate
the cellular uptake by MDA-MB-231 cells after treatments
with varying formulations. Results showed that the rank of
cellular uptake was free coumarin > functional coumarin
liposomes > coumarin liposomes > blank control.
Figure 3C displays the targeting effect of varying
coumarin labeled liposomes. In the confocal images,
integrin β3 receptor exhibited red fluorescence, whereas
the nuclei were stained in blue. Bright yellow fluorescence
was a composite image of green and red fluorescence,
and used to indicate the targeting effect of the liposomes
with integrin β3 receptor on MDA-MB-231 cells. Results
demonstrated that the functional coumarin liposomes
were bound with the integrin β3 receptor and exhibited
substantially higher green fluorescence intensity in
the MDA-MB-231 cells compared with the coumarin
liposomes, which suggests that more functional liposomes
had been internalized by the cancer cells.

Figure 1: Schematic design and mechanism of functional vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes for the treatment of
TNBC and VM channel elimination. Notes: During hypoxic conditions, the transcription of VE-Cad is increased, and EphA2

is subsequently re-localized to the cell membrane and phosphorylated. Phosphorylated EphA2 directly activates PI3K or initiates the
activation of FAK and downstream PI3K. Activated PI3K, in turn, activates MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9), which eventually results in VM
channel formation. Functional vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes specifically bind to integrin receptors on cancer cells. The internalized
liposomes induce the apoptosis of cancer cells through a cascade of apoptotic reactions via the activation of caspase 8, 9, and 3, the
increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, the decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, and generation of ROS.
Furthermore, they destroy VM channels via the decreased expression of VE-Cad, FAK, PI3K, MMP-2 and MMP-9.

Among these results, functional vincristine plus dasatinib

In addition, strong fluorescent signals were identified

In addition, the preliminary systemic toxicities after
the treatments were evaluated via the body weight, blood
examination and histopathological observation of major
organs. Compared with physiological saline, there were no

a higher accumulation in tumor tissues, for up to 48 h. In
contrast, the fluorescent signal in tumor tissues gradually
decreased at 12 h after treatment with DiR liposomes,
whereas the fluorescent signal rapidly accumulated in the
liver after treatment with free DiR.

DISCUSSION
The residual aggressive cancer cells of TNBC can
form the VM channels by self-transforming to support
further growth of cancer tissue, leading to relapse and
metastasis of the cancer. The VM channels are detected in
clinical breast cancer specimens and associated with a poor
5-year survival rate [23–25]. Therefore, the functional
vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes were developed

36633

Oncotarget

for treatment of TNBC along with deletion of the VM
channels.
In the functional liposomes, vincristine was
encapsulated into the inner vesicle, and dasatinib was
incorporated into the lipid bilayer of DSPE-PEG2000c(RGDyK) modified liposomes. The liposomes exhibited
good characterizations of small and well-distributed
particle size, high encapsulation efficiencies (Table 1),
smooth surface (Figure 2B2) and delayed drug release
(Figure 2C). The particle size is suitable to avoid kidney
filtration but allows to be accumulated into cancer tissues
via EPR effects [26]. This delayed drug release is beneficial
to prevent rapid leakage during circulation in the blood
system and increase drug accumulation in cancer tissues.
TNBC cells and VM-capable cancer cells are drugresistant, and the improvement of cellular uptake is the
first step to enhance their efficacy. To address this issue,
c(RGDyK) peptide was used as a targeting molecule for

binding with the integrin receptor overexpressed on these
cells. In evaluating cellular uptake (Figure 3A and 3B),
the results demonstrate that the fluorescent intensity of
functional coumarin liposomes is clearly stronger than
the unmodified liposomes, which indicates the increased
cellular uptake by cancer cells. Moreover, free coumarin
also exhibits clear ingestion by cancer cells because
of its direct contact permeation. The targeting effect is
observed with a confocal microscope (Figure 3C). After
incubation with functional liposomes, a bright yellow
fluorescence was observed, indicating the targeting effect
of functional  liposomes with integrin β3 receptor on
MDA-MB-231 cells.
In the inhibitory effects assay (Figure 4A), stronger
inhibitory effects are observed after co-treatment of free
vincristine with free dasatinib, indicating that dasatinib
can enhance anticancer effects possibly by inducing
apoptosis of cancer cells. Compared with other liposomes,

functional vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes exhibit
the strongest inhibitory effects on MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 4B). This is attributed to the increased cellular
uptake by the targeted action.
Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death
involved in cellular stress [27]. In this study, functional
vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes exhibited the strongest
inducing effects via the activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3
and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax or the suppression of
the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 (Figure 5A to 5C). The
activation effect on caspase 8 and caspase 9 demonstrate
the involvement of the death receptor signaling pathway
and the mitochondrial signaling pathway during apoptosis,
respectively [28–31]. As upstream initiators of apoptosis,
activated caspases 8 and 9 initiate the activation of the
downstream effector caspase 3, which leads to a cascade
of apoptotic reactions in the cancer cells [32]. When being
activated, pro-apoptotic protein Bax forms dimers and
permeabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane, thereby
inducing apoptosis [33, 34]. In contrast, the anti-apoptotic
protein Mcl-1 neutralizes the activity of pro-apoptotic
proteins, and ultimately retard apoptotic reactions [35].
Under the induction of functional vincristine plus dasatinib

liposomes, the balance slants to promote apoptotic
reactions by increasing Bax activity and suppressing
Mcl-1 activity.
Appropriate level of ROS plays important role
in keeping redox balance and cell proliferation under
physiological conditions [36]. However, under oxidative
stress conditions, excess ROS exhibit a cytotoxic nature.
Excessive ROS levels in MDA-MB-231 cells were
produced by treatment with functional vincristine plus
dasatinib liposomes (Figure 5D), and the generated ROS
could be involved in mitochondrial membrane damage
and cytochrome C release, which induce apoptosis as
well [37]. Besides, the greater ROS levels also cause
acute injury by necrosis, which thus increases the overall
cytotoxicity in the cancer cells.
Under hypoxic conditions, phenotype-transformed
invasive cancer cells can form VM channels after
treatment [38]. The functional vincristine plus dasatinib
liposomes displayed the strongest destructive effect
on VM channels (Figure 6A) through the increased
cellular uptake, the induced apoptosis and the inhibited
marker molecules. During VM channel formation,
VE-Cad transcription is increased, and tyrosine kinase

receptor A2 (EphA2) is subsequently re-localized to
the cell membrane and phosphorylated. The activated
EphA2 proteins promote the localization of FAK to
new focal adhesion sites and subsequently activate
PI3K, which thus triggers cell migration and VM
channel formation. In addition, the activated VE-Cad
and EphA2 proteins also directly activate PI3K, which
then promotes the MMP precursor to form MMPs,
ultimately promoting the cancer cell binding to
form VM channels. After treatments with functional
vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes, the expressions
of these protein indicators were significantly decreased
(Figure 6B to 6F), suggesting a destroying effect on the
VM channels, hence being beneficial for eradicating
the TNBC.

demonstrated that the functional coumarin liposomes
show a strong penetrating ability (Figure 7A), and the
functional vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes exhibit
a strong destructing efficacy (Figure 7B and 7C). These
results indicated the roles of functional vincristine plus
dasatinib liposomes in potentially treating refractory solid
TNBC with a strong penetrating ability and a destructing
efficacy.
The in vivo study was evaluated on tumor-bearing
mice from several aspects: anticancer efficacy, induction of
apoptosis, VM channels elimination and safety evaluation.
The functional vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes
exhibited the strongest overall anticancer efficacy

(Figure 8A1), elimination of VM channels (Figure 8B)
and induction of apoptosis (Figure 8C) in tumor tissues.
The enhanced efficacy could be explained as follows:
the pegylated liposomes showed a long circulatory effect
(Figure 9) by escaping from the rapid clearance by RES
in blood circulation [40]; the suitable particle size of the
liposomes allows for more accumulation in tumor tissue
(Figure 9) by EPR effects; functional liposomes could
improve the cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by the
increased cellular uptake; and the combination therapy
of vincristine and dasatinib enhances the apoptosis and
eliminate the VM channels by inhibiting VM indicators.

Cells were grown in Leibovitz’s L15 medium (Macgene,
Beijing, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gibco, Billings, USA) in a 37°C humidified
incubator. Female BALB/c nude mice (initial weight
of 16–18 g) were obtained from the Peking University
Experimental Animal Center (Beijing, China). All animal
experimental procedures were performed with the approval
of the Institutional Authority for Laboratory Animal Care
of Peking University according to the guidelines.

Synthesis of targeting molecules

DSPE-PEG2000 and DSPE-PEG2000-NHS were
obtained from the NOF Corporation (Tokyo, Japan).
The cyclic RGD peptide (c(RGDyK)) was synthesized
by GL Biochem Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Vincristine
sulfate and dasatinib were supplied by Nanjing Tianzun
Zezhong Chemicals, Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China). Other
chemicals were analytical or high performance liquid
chromatography grade.

DSPE-PEG2000-c(RGDyK)
conjugate
was
synthesized via the following procedures. Briefly,
c(RGDyK) peptide and DSPE-PEG2000-NHS were
dissolved at a ratio of 2:1 (mol/mol) in anhydrous
dimethylformamide, and the pH of the reaction
solution was adjusted to 9.0 using N-methyl morphine.
The solution was then continuously stirred at room
temperature for 24 h. The reaction mixture was
subsequently transferred into dialysis tubing (cut-off
MW, 3000 Da) and dialyzed against deionized water
for 48 h. The resultant was then lyophilized and
stored at -20°C. The product was confirmed using a
MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker Daltonics, Germany).

reported  [41]. Briefly, egg phosphatidylcholine,
cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000, DSPE-PEG2000-c(RGDyK)
conjugate and dasatinib were dissolved in chloroform and
methanol (3:1, v/v) at a ratio of 66:26:2.5:3:3.5 (mol/mol)
in a pear-shaped bottle. The solvent was removed by a
rotary vacuum evaporator, and the lipid film was hydrated
with 250 mM ammonium sulfate by water-bath sonication
for 5 min. The suspensions were subsequently treated using
an ultrasonic cell disruptor for 10 min and successively
extruded through polycarbonate membranes with pore
sizes of 400 and 200 nm, 3 times each. The suspensions
obtained were dialyzed (cut-off MW, 12,000–14,000 Da)
in Hepes buffered saline (25 mM Hepes/150 mM NaCl)
for 24 h and incubated with vincristine solution in a
water bath at 40°C with continual shaking for 30 min
(lipids: drug = 20:1, w/w). Then, functional vincristine
plus dasatinib liposomes were obtained. Blank functional
liposomes, vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes and
vincristine liposomes were prepared using the same
procedures by excluding the addition of dasatinib or
DSPE-PEG2000-c(RGDyK) conjugate or DSPE-PEG2000c(RGDyK) conjugate and dasatinib, respectively, during
the film formation process. Moreover, using fluorescent
probes to evaluate the distribution in vivo, four types of
liposomes were similarly prepared, including coumarin
liposomes, functional coumarin liposomes (lipids:
coumarin = 500:1, w/w), DiR liposomes and functional
DiR liposomes (lipids: DiR = 200:1, w/w).
The particle sizes, PDI and zeta potential
values were measured using a Nano Series Zen 4003
Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK). The
morphology of the liposomes was observed using an AFM
(SPI3800N series SPA-400, Tokyo, Japan). The in vitro
release of vincristine or dasatinib from the liposomes was
achieved by dialysis against phosphate buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.4) that contained 10% FBS at 37°C.

1 μM coumarin for another 2 h. Culture medium was used
as a blank control. After incubation, the cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then blocked
with 10% goat serum that contained 0.3 M glycine for 2 h
at room temperature. After being washed by PBS (pH 7.4),
MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with anti-integrin
β3 antibody (1:100 dilution, Abcam) at 4°C overnight,
followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated
(1:500 dilution, Abcam) at room temperature for 2 h.
After being washed by PBS, nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/mL) for 10 min. Finally, the cells
were imaged and analyzed using a confocal laser scanning
fluorescent microscopy (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany).

Inhibitory effects and induction of apoptosis on
TNBC cells
To compare the inhibitory effects of the different
formulations, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at a
density of 7000 cells/well in 96-well culture plates and
cultured for 24 h. The cells were subsequently treated
with serial concentrations of the drug formulations. The
final concentration of vincristine ranged between 0–1 μM,
whereas the concentration of dasatinib was in the range
of 0.1–1.0 μM. Culture medium was used as a blank
control. After treatment for 48 h, the inhibitory effects
were determined using a sulforhodamine-B staining assay
[42]. Survival rates were calculated using the following
formula: survival (%) = (A540 nm for treated cells/A540 nm for
control cells) × 100%, where A540 nm is the absorbance at
540 nm as measured by a microplate reader (Infinite F50,
Tecan Group Ltd., Shanghai, China).
Apoptosis was identified using a fluorescein
annexin V staining kit (Biosea Biotechnology Co., Ltd,
Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at a
density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well culture plates for
24 h at 37°C. After 24 h incubation, the cells were treated
with varying drug formulations at a concentration of 0.1
μM vincristine or dasatinib. Culture medium was used as
a blank control. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were
handled according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
assessed via flow cytometry. Each assay was repeated
in triplicate.

Cellular uptake by TNBC cells and targeting
effect
Coumarin was used as a fluorescent probe to
determine the cellular uptake. To evaluate the cellular
uptake, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at a density of
4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well culture plates. After 24 h, the
cells were treated with free coumarin, coumarin liposomes
and functional coumarin liposomes at a final concentration
of 0.5 μM coumarin for another 4 h. Culture medium was
used as a blank control. After incubation, the cells were
collected to measure the fluorescence intensity using
a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Each assay was repeated
in triplicate.
To evaluate the targeting effect, MDA-MB-231 cells
were seeded into chambered cover slides at a density of
2 × 105 cells/dish. After 24 h incubation, the cells were
treated with free coumarin, coumarin liposomes and
functional coumarin liposomes at a final concentration of

Apoptotic signaling pathways of TNBC cells
MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 96-well plates
and incubated for 24 h, followed by treatment with varying
drug formulations at a concentration of 0.1 μM vincristine
or dasatinib. Culture medium was added as a blank
control. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.5%
Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked with 10% goat serum
that contained 0.3 M glycine for 2 h at room temperature.
The cells were subsequently incubated with the primary
antibody (Sangon, China) at 4°C overnight, followed by
incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with
36638

Oncotarget

Alexafluor-488 (OriGene, China) at room temperature
for 2 h. Both primary and secondary antibodies were
properly diluted according to the instructions. Nuclei
were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/mL) for 10 min at
room temperature. The fluorescence intensity of each well
was measured using the Operetta high content screening
system and calculated with the Columbus system.
To evaluate the ROS-related apoptotic pathway,
MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at
a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. The
formulation administrations were the same as previously
described. After 6 h incubation with varying formulations,
the cells were stained with 1 μM DCFH-DA (Biotime,
China) for 10 min. The cells were then washed, harvested
and re-suspended in PBS and determined immediately via
flow cytometry.

To monitor the penetration ability, coumarin was
used as a fluorescent probe. The MDA-MB-231 tumor
spheroids were treated with free coumarin, coumarin
liposomes, and functional coumarin liposomes for 12 h,
respectively. The final concentration of coumarin was
10.0  μM. After incubation, the spheroids were washed
with PBS and subsequently scanned at different layers
from the top of the spheroids to the inside using the
confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope.
To evaluate the destructive effects of different
formulations, MDA-MB-231 tumor spheroids were
collected in 6-well culture plates and then treated
with varying formulations at a concentration of 1 μM
vincristine or dasatinib. Culture medium was used as a
blank control. After incubation for 48 h, the spheroids
were fixed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 60 min, rinsed three
times with PBS, dehydrated and embedded. The spheroids
were subsequently observed under a scanning electron
microscope (SEM, JSM-5600 LV, JEOL, Japan).
After a tumor spheroid was formed in a well,
varying formulations were added at a concentration of 1
μM vincristine or dasatinib. Culture medium was used as
a blank control. The inhibitory effect was evaluated via
the measurement of the tumor spheroid under an inverted
microscope. Briefly, the major (dmax) and minor (dmin)
diameters of each spheroid were measured, and the spheroid
volume was calculated as previously described by the
following formula: V = (π × dmax × dmin) / 6 [45]. The tumor
spheroid volume ratio was subsequently calculated using the
formula R = (Vday i / Vday 0) × 100%, where Vday i is the tumor
spheroid volume at the ith day (day after drug treatments),
and Vday 0 is the tumor spheroid volume prior to treatment.

Destruction of VM channels of TNBC cells
A matrigel-based tube formation assay was used
to assess the destructive effect on the VM channels of
MDA-MB-231 cells [43]. Briefly, culture plates (96-well)
were coated with matrigel (50 μL/well) and allowed to
polymerize at 37°C for 30 min. MDA-MB-231 cells
were collected and resuspended with serum-free culture
medium at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and subsequently
seeded in wells that contained varying formulations at a
concentration of 0.01 μM vincristine or dasatinib. Blank
medium was used as a control. After incubation for 10 h,
each well was photographed and analyzed using an EVOS
microscope.
The expression levels of six proteins (VE-Cad,
FAK, PI3K, EphA2, MMP-2, and MMP-9) in
MDA-MB-231 cells were determined using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay kits (Cusabio Biotech Co.
Ltd., Beijing, China). Briefly, cells were cultured to 80%
confluence and then treated with varying formulations
for 12 h. The final concentration of vincristine or
dasatinib was 0.1 μM. Culture medium was used as a
blank control. After incubation, the cells were harvested
and lysed. The cell lysates were analyzed using a
microplate reader according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for the kits.

Anticancer efficacy
Approximately 1 × 107 MDA-MB-231 cells were
subcutaneously injected into the right armpits of BALB/c
female nude mice. Following growth to a volume of
approximately 1000 mm3, the tumors were extracted, cut
into pieces of approximately 2 × 2 × 2 mm3, and then seeded
into the right armpits of fresh nude mice with a tumor
inoculation needle. When the tumors reached approximately
100 mm3 in volume, the mice were randomly divided into
five treatment groups (n = 6) and treated with physiological
saline, free vincristine, vincristine liposomes, vincristine
plus dasatinib liposomes, or functional vincristine plus
dasatinib liposomes via the tail vein at days 12, 14, 16, 18,
20 and 22 after inoculation. The dosage of vincristine was
1 mg/kg (vincristine: dasatinib = 1:1, mol/mol). The mice
were weighed, and the tumors were measured with calipers.
The tumor volumes (V) were calculated with the formula
V = (length × width2) / 2 (mm3), and the tumor volume
ratios were evaluated with the formula R (%) = Vday i / V day
× 100%, where Vday i is the tumor volume at day i, and Vday
11
is the tumor volume at day 11.

Destruction of TNBC tumor spheroids
Multicellular tumor spheroids of MDA-MB-231
cells were grown in vitro using the liquid overlay
system  [44]. Briefly, agarose was added to serum-free
culture medium and heated to 80°C for 30 min to form
a 2% (w/v) solution. Each well of a 96-well culture plate
was coated with 50 μL agarose solution. After cooling to
ambient temperature, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded
at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well with 100 μL growth
medium. The culture plates were gently shaken for 5 min
and incubated for 48 h to form tumor spheroids.

efficacy in TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and
in TNBC-bearing nude mice. The action mechanism
involved the following aspects: (i) the pegylated
liposomes and the nanostructured particle size resulted
in prolonged circulation in the blood and more drug
accumulation in the tumor tissue; (ii) the targeting
molecule promoted cellular drug uptake; (iii) the
induction of apoptosis potentiated the overall anticancer
efficacy via activation of capases (8,9, and 3), increased
expression of Bax, decreased expression of Mcl-1, and
generation of ROS; and (iv) the destructive effect on the
VM channels prevented the residual cancer cells from
the relapse after treatment via inhibition of VM channel
indicators, which consisted of VE-Cad, FAK, PI3K,
MMP-2, and MMP-9. It is concluded that the functional
vincristine plus dasatinib liposomes may provide a
potential strategy for treatment of TNBC along with
elimination of VM channels.

A routine blood analysis of the mice was
conducted using an MEK-6318K Hematology
Analyzer (Nihon Kohden, Japan) prior to euthanasia.
The mice were subsequently euthanized at day 25 via
cervical dislocation. The tumor masses were carefully
isolated to prepare cryosections for the TUNEL assay
using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (KeyGen
Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). The FITClabeled TUNEL-positive cells were imaged via the
confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscopy. To
evaluate the in vivo destructive effect on VM channels,
CD34 endothelial marker PAS dual staining was
used [46]. Briefly, the assay was performed on the
tumor slices using a CD34 antibody (1:300 dilution,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), Peroxidase Kit
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and PAS staining
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
ultimately  photographed  using an EVOS microscope.
Other organs were removed to create paraffin
sections for hematoxylin and eosin staining for safety
examination.

In vivo imaging in mice
Non-invasive optical imaging systems were
used to observe the real-time distribution and tumor
accumulation ability of DiR-loaded liposomes in
MDA-MB-231 xenografts. When the tumors reached
approximately 500 mm3 in volume, the mice were
randomly divided into four groups (3 mice per
group). The mice were subsequently administered
physiological saline, free DiR, DiR liposomes, or
functional DiR liposomes via the tail vein. The
mice were then anesthetized with isoflurane and
scanned at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 h using a Kodak
multimodal imaging system (Carestream Health,
Inc., USA). To further observe the distribution status,
the mice were immediately euthanized to collect the
tumor  masses and major organs. The fluorescence
signal intensities in different tissues were measured.
