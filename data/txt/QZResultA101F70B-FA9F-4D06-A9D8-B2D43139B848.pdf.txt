Abstract
The proteasome was validated as an oncology target following the clinical success of VELCADE (bortezomib) for injection for the treatment of multiple myeloma and recurring mantle cell lymphoma. Consequently,
several groups are pursuing the development of additional small-molecule proteasome inhibitors for both hematologic and solid tumor indications. Here, we describe MLN9708, a selective, orally bioavailable, secondgeneration proteasome inhibitor that is in phase I clinical development. MLN9708 has a shorter proteasome
dissociation half-life and improved pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity compared
with bortezomib. MLN9708 has a larger blood volume distribution at steady state, and analysis of 20S proteasome inhibition and markers of the unfolded protein response confirmed that MLN9708 has greater pharmacodynamic effects in tissues than bortezomib. MLN9708 showed activity in both solid tumor and hematologic
preclinical xenograft models, and we found a correlation between greater pharmacodynamic responses and
improved antitumor activity. Moreover, antitumor activity was shown via multiple dosing routes, including
oral gavage. Taken together, these data support the clinical development of MLN9708 for both hematologic
and solid tumor indications. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1970–80. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The ubiquitin-proteasome system processes the majority
of cellular proteins and is the principal manner by which
cells regulate protein homeostasis. During normal protein
homeostasis, specific proteins are targeted for destruction
via the attachment of ubiquitin. These proteasome substrates include misfolded proteins and highly regulated
members of critical signaling cascades, including proteins
involved in growth control, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. Proteasome inhibition results in the stabilization
and accumulation of these substrates, leading to the activation of antiproliferative signals, cell cycle disruption, activation of apoptotic pathways, and, ultimately, cell death (1, 2).
Rapidly growing malignant cells, already deficient in normal
cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms, seem to be highly susceptible to proteasome inhibition (3–6). Therefore, the proteasome emerged as an attractive target for anticancer

therapeutics. The success of the first-in-class small-molecule proteasome inhibitor VELCADE (bortezomib) for injection (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) validated the
proteasome as a therapeutic target for the treatment of human cancer (1, 7–12). VELCADE is approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and previously
treated mantle cell lymphoma (13–21). At present, there
are multiple groups in the process of developing small-molecule proteasome inhibitors for various oncology indications. These include both reversible inhibitors, such as
CEP-18770, and irreversible inhibitors, such as carfilzomib
and NPI-0052. Both CEP-18770 and NPI-0052 are orally active, and all three compounds have shown antitumor activity in preclinical models and are currently in various stages
of clinical development (22–30).
The 26S proteasome consists of a 20S multicatalytic core
capped on either end with 19S regulatory subunits. The 20S
proteasome is a chambered, barrel-like structure containing
two heptameric rings made from α subunits and two heptameric rings made from β subunits. The α rings perform capping and gating functions, whereas three of the β subunits
(β1, β2, and β5) contain the NH2-terminal threonines responsible for the different proteasome proteolytic activities.
The β1, β2, and β5 subunits are referred to as caspase-like,
trypsin-like, and chymotrypsin-like, respectively, because the
preferred cleavage site of each subunit is similar to those of
other well-known proteases (2, 31–34).
Bortezomib shows time-dependent inhibition of the 20S
proteasome by binding to the NH2-terminal threonine side
chain of the catalytic β subunits. Bortezomib exhibits

Preclinical Assessment of MLN9708

inhibitory activity against all three β subunits but preferentially binds to and inhibits the β5 site (35). Although
bortezomib has shown clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, to date, it has yet to exhibit strong activity in solid tumor indications, perhaps due to
its inability to penetrate into tissues and achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations at those target sites. Therefore, there is a strong rationale for identifying proteasome
inhibitors that have different physicochemical or pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we describe the biochemical
and preclinical pharmacology data that support the development of MLN9708. MLN9708 is a second-generation
small-molecule proteasome inhibitor being developed for
the treatment of a broad range of human malignancies.
MLN9708 was selected from a large pool of boron-containing proteasome inhibitors based on a physicochemical profile that was distinct from bortezomib. MLN9708 has a
shorter 20S proteasome dissociation half-life than bortezomib, which we believe plays an important role in its improved tissue distribution. Direct comparison with
bortezomib revealed that MLN9708 has an improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and shows superior antitumor activity in both solid tumor and
hematologic xenograft models, and shows antitumor activity when administered via multiple dosing routes and regimens. MLN9708 is currently being evaluated in multiple
phase I clinical studies for both solid- and hematologicbased tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
WSU-DLCL2, OCI-Ly7, A375, H460, HCT-116, HT-29, MDAMB-231, HEK293, and Calu-6 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and maintained as recommended by the supplier.
In vitro Assays
Kinetic analysis of 20S proteasome inhibition. Kinetic
analysis of 20S proteasome inhibition was performed as previously described by Williamson and colleagues (36).
NF-κB-Luc and 4×Ub-Luc cell-based reporter assays.
NF-κB-Luc and 4×Ub-Luc cell-based reporter assays were
performed as previously described by Williamson and colleagues (36).
Proteasome-Glo IC50 and inhibitor washout cell-based
assays. Calu-6 cells were cultured in MEM containing 10%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and plated 1 d before the start of the experiment at 10,000 cells per
well in a 384-well plate. For IC50 determinations, cells were
treated with varying concentrations of bortezomib or
MLN2238 in DMSO (0.5% final, v/v) for 1 h at 37°C. For reversibility experiments, cells were treated with either 1 μmol/L
bortezomib or MLN2238 for 30 min at 37°C and then washed
thrice in medium to remove the compounds. Cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37°C, after which the medium
was removed and replaced with fresh medium. Proteasome
activity was assessed by monitoring hydrolysis of the chymo-

trypsin-like substrate Suc-LLVY-aminoluciferin in the presence of luciferase using the Proteasome-Glo assay reagents
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega
Corp.). Luminescence was measured using a LEADseeker
instrument (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Pharmacokinetic Studies
Blood and tumor samples were collected before dose and
numerous time points after dosing. Each time point represents the average value of three animals. MLN2238 or bortezomib concentrations in blood and plasma samples were
determined using a non–good laboratory practice liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)–
based method. MLN2238 or bortezomib was isolated from
50 μL of plasma or blood using a liquid-liquid extraction procedure. Sample (50 μL) was mixed with 50 μL of internal
standard solution, 50 μL of 0.5 mol/L HCl, and 500 μL of
methyl tertiary butyl ether. The supernatant (300 μL) was
then transferred to a clean 96-well plate, evaporated, reconstituted in 100 μL of acetonitrile/water (5:95) containing 0.1%
formic acid, and injected onto the LC/MS/MS system for
analysis. A reverse-phase gradient method provided sample
stacking and separation. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the
blood and plasma concentration data was performed using
WinNonlin version 5.2 (Pharsight Corp.). Kinetic parameters
were estimated using a noncompartmental model using sparse
sampling mode (model 201 for plasma and blood). Area
under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) and area under the effect versus time curve (AUE) values were calculated
using the linear trapezoidal rule.
Pharmacodynamic Studies
Approximately 200 μL of whole blood were collected from
each animal and processed for the 20S blood proteasome
inhibition assay. Subcutaneous tumors (approximately 600–
800 mm3 in size) were harvested and divided into two or
three parts. One was processed for the 20S tissue proteasome
inhibition assay, one for Western blot analysis, and one for
immunohistochemistry.
Tumor processing for 20S tissue proteasome assays.
Frozen samples were pulverized in the Tissue CryoPrep
(Covaris) and transferred to glass tubes. After addition of
1 mL of cold tissue lysis buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH
8.0), 1 mmol/L DTT], samples were placed on ice and homogenized as per the manufacturer's instructions using the
Covaris E200.
Tumor processing for Western blot assays. Tumors were
processed as described above in the Covaris E200. M-PER
lysis buffer (Pierce) was supplemented with the following:
1× protease inhibitor cocktail set (Calbiochem), 2 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 25 mmol/L sodium fluoride,
and 25 mmol/L β-glycerophosphate. Cold lysis buffer (300–
800 μL) was added to the tumors just before sonication. After
sonication, supernatants were transferred to new tubes and
protein concentrations were determined.
Western blot analysis. Tumor lysate (50 μg) was loaded
onto 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were
transferred to PVDF-FL membranes (Millipore) using a

semidry transfer apparatus. After transfer and blocking,
membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed thrice with TBSTween 20 (TBST) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 680–labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Molecular
Probes) for 1 h. Membranes were washed five times with
TBST and once with TBS while protected from light. Membranes were dried and scanned with the Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-tubulin (rabbit polyclonal,
1:15,000 dilution; Abcam) and anti–growth arrest DNA damage 34 (GADD34; Proteintech Group, Inc.). Secondary antibody was used at 1:20,000 for tubulin and 1:2,000 for
GADD34. Quantitation of Western blot signals was performed with Odyssey software.
20S β5 proteasome tumor and blood assays. 20S β5 proteasome tumor and blood assays were performed as previously described (36–38).
Immunohistochemical studies. Formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded CWR22 and WSU-DLCL2 xenograft tumor sections (5 μm) were stained with primary antibodies to
GADD34, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), and
cleaved caspase-3 (Proteintech Group, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Cell Signaling Technology). The GADD34 and
ATF3 antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibodies (UltraMap anti-rabbit,
Ventana Medical Systems) and incubated with the ChromoMap 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit (Ventana Medical Systems). The cleaved caspase-3 antibody was detected with
Alexa Fluor 594–labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen).
Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin for GADD34
and ATF3 assays and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for
cleaved caspase-3 assay. Images were captured using an
Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon Instruments), 20× objective,
and Retiga EXi color digital camera (QImaging). Five fields
of view were captured per sample, and images were processed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).
Pharmacodynamic marker levels were measured by color
thresholding on the DAB or fluorescent signal and measuring area of thresholded signal. Percent positive area was
calculated by normalizing with the total area of the field
of view.
Animal Care
CB17–severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and nonobese diabetic (NOD)–SCID mice were housed and maintained in a controlled environment and received food and
water ad libitum. Veterinary care for the animals was provided in accordance with Millennium Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Efficacy Studies
CWR22 xenografts. Male CB17-SCID mice (Charles River
Laboratories), approximately 8 to 11 wk of age, were inoculated s.c. with freshly dissected CWR22 tumor fragments
(∼20 mg) in the right dorsal flank. Mean tumor volume
(MTV) was calculated using the following formula: 0.5 ×
(length × width 2 ). When MTV reached approximately

1972

Cancer Res; 70(5) March 1, 2010

150 to 200 mm3, animals were randomized into treatment
groups (n = 10 per group) before dosing. Antitumor activity
was determined at the end of the study by calculating the
treatment over control (T/C) ratio of their MTVs at the
end of the study.
WSU-DLCL2 xenografts. Female CB17-SCID mice, ∼6 wk
of age, were inoculated s.c. with 4 × 106 WSU-DLCL2 tumor
cells suspended in 0.1 mL RPMI 1640 in the right dorsal flank.
Animals were randomized, and the MTV and T/C ratio were
calculated as described above.
OCI-Ly7-Luc disseminated xenografts. Female NOD-SCID
mice, ∼9 wk of age, were inoculated i.v. via the tail vein with
1.0 × 106 OCI-Ly7-Luc tumor cells. Mice were randomized into treatment groups (n = 10 per group) on day 7 after inoculation. For each imaging session, animals received 150 mg/
kg of luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences) via i.p. injection. Animal
dorsal and ventral views were imaged to determine total
photon flux. Images were captured by the Xenogen IVIS imaging system (Xenogen Corp.), and data were collected with
Xenogen Living Image software (Living Image 3.0.2.2). Antitumor activity was determined by calculating the T/C ratio of
the mean photon flux measurements at the end of the study.
Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier
method.
Statistical Analyses
Efficacy data were analyzed using a linear mixed-effect
regression model. Differences among mice were treated
as random effects, and a compound symmetry covariance
structure was used to model the variability between repeated tumor measurements for each mouse. Treatment
comparisons were performed by taking fitted curves from
the model to calculate ΔAUCs. The significance of the
ΔAUC was assessed using permutation testing. P values
of ≤0.05 were considered significant. For the OCI-Ly7-Luc
study, differences in total photon flux among mice were
compared using one-way ANOVA and pairwise comparisons were adjusted by the Tukey-Kramer method. Survival
curves generated using the Kaplan-Meier methods were
compared using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and pairwise comparisons were adjusted with the Bonferroni
correction.

Results and Discussion
MLN2238 is a selective, potent, and reversible inhibitor
of the proteasome. MLN9708 was identified in screens for
small-molecule proteasome inhibitors with an improved
pharmacologic profile compared with bortezomib (Fig. 1).
In preclinical studies, MLN9708 immediately hydrolyzed to
MLN2238 (see Supplementary Data), the biologically active
form, on exposure to aqueous solutions or plasma. In studies where a solution of MLN9708 was added directly into
rat, dog, or human plasma and immediately extracted and
analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, only
MLN2238 could be identified. MLN2238 is an N-capped dipeptidyl leucine boronic acid and preferentially bound to
and inhibited the chymotrypsin-like proteolytic (β5) site

of the 20S proteasome with an IC50 value of 3.4 nmol/L (Ki
of 0.93 nmol/L; Table 1). At higher concentrations, it also
inhibited the caspase-like (β1) and trypsin-like (β2) proteolytic sites (IC50 of 31 and 3,500 nmol/L, respectively).
Although the selectivity and potency of MLN2238 were
similar to that of bortezomib, the proteasome binding kinetics for these two molecules are different. Both MLN2238
and bortezomib showed time-dependent reversible proteasome inhibition; however, the proteasome dissociation
half-life (t1/2) for MLN2238 was determined to be ∼6-fold
faster than that of bortezomib (t1/2 of 18 and 110 minutes,
respectively).
MLN2238 is a potent inhibitor of the proteasome in
tumor cells. To build on the biochemistry results, a series
of cell-based experiments were performed to confirm potent proteasome inhibition in cells. Proteasome inhibition
results in the stabilization and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which have been targeted for destruction.

This leads to cell cycle disruption, activation of apoptotic
pathways, and active cell death (39–43). Initial studies examined the effects of MLN2238 treatment on an exogenous
proteasome substrate. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing a
4×Ub-Luc reporter (36) were treated with increasing concentrations of MLN2238 and bortezomib. Both compounds
strongly inhibited proteasome activity, resulting in accumulation of the luciferase reporter with similar EC50 values
(Table 1). The effect of bortezomib and MLN2238 on tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)–induced activation of the NF-κB
pathway was also examined (44). Proteasome inhibition
prevents the degradation of IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB, resulting in a decrease in NF-κB–driven gene expression.
HEK293 cells stably expressing a NF-κB-Luc reporter were
treated with increasing concentrations of MLN2238 and
bortezomib. Both compounds strongly inhibited TNF-α−induced activation of the NF-κB pathway, resulting in similar
EC50 values (Table 1).

in the low nanomolar range and comparable with those
calculated with purified 20S proteasome. Recovery of pro-

teasome activity was determined by performing washout
experiments with MLN2238 or bortezomib. Cells were treated with the drug for 4 hours, after which the drug was
removed and proteasome activity was assessed. Proteasome activity in MLN2238-treated cells recovered to 69%
of control cells, whereas activity in bortezomib-treated

Cancer Research

Preclinical Assessment of MLN9708

cells recovered to only 20% (Table 1). The difference in recovery of proteasome activity between MLN2238 and
bortezomib is consistent with the observed differences in
proteasome t1/2 between the two molecules.
Cell viability studies were performed in a variety of
mammalian cell lines to compare the in vitro antiproliferative effects of MLN2238 with bortezomib. Studies performed with A375 (lung), H460 (lung), HCT-116 (colon),
and HT-29 (colon) cells revealed similar LD50 values for
the two compounds, which ranged from 4 to 58 nmol/L
(Table 1).
Taken together, these in vitro studies show that MLN2238
is a potent inhibitor of the β5 site of the 20S proteasome
and that MLN2238 dissociated more rapidly from the proteasome than bortezomib, consistent with faster recovery of
proteasome activity observed in the Proteasome-Glo assay.
Given the high concentrations of proteasome found in
RBCs, we hypothesized that RBC partitioning would serve

as a drug sink for bortezomib and limit its distribution outside of the blood compartment; the shorter proteasome t1/2
of MLN2238 should allow improved drug distribution into
tissues. To address this issue directly, a series of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy studies with
MLN2238 and bortezomib were performed in different xenograft models.
Pharmacokinetics of MLN2238 and bortezomib. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of MLN2238 and bortezomib, mice were administered a single dose of
MLN2238 at 14 mg/kg i.v. and 11 mg/kg orally or bortezomib at 0.8 mg/kg i.v. These doses represent the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) for each drug for the specified route
of administration. Exposures were determined by measuring the blood and plasma drug concentrations at various
time points following the initial dose (Table 1). The concentration-versus-time curve of i.v. administered MLN2238
displayed a distinct biexponential profile with a steep ini-

volume distribution at steady state (Vdss, b) rather than

plasma volume distribution at steady state (Vd ss, p ).
MLN2238 showed larger Vdss, b (20.2 L/kg) compared with
bortezomib (4.3 L/kg), providing supportive evidence that
MLN2238 more easily moves from the blood compartment

into the tissue compartment. MLN2238 also showed moderate oral bioavailability (Table 1; Fig. 1C). To determine
the pharmacokinetic profile of MLN2238 and bortezomib
in a second species, Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single i.v. dose of MLN2238 at either 0.3 or 0.2
mg/kg or bortezomib at 0.2 mg/kg. Both MLN2238 doses
provided a greater plasma exposure (AUC0–48h of 704 and
1,070 h·ng/mL for 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg doses, respectively)
compared with bortezomib (AUC0–48h of 206 h·ng/mL),
confirming that MLN2238 also has improved plasma exposure compared with bortezomib in rodents (Fig. 1D).
MLN2238 induces a greater pharmacodynamic response
than bortezomib in xenograft tumors. To further evaluate
the activity of MLN2238 in vivo, a series of pharmacodynamic
studies were performed in CB17-SCID mice bearing human
prostate (CWR22) or human lymphoma tumors (WSUDLCL2). Pharmacodynamic responses were assessed by measuring (a) the degree of 20S proteasome inhibition and (b)
the expression levels of the GADD34 protein.
Blood and tumor 20S proteasome inhibition versus time
profiles were generated for MLN2238 and bortezomib from
both CWR22 and WSU-DLCL2 xenografts (Fig. 2). The AUE
was calculated from 0 to 24 hours (AUE0–24h) for both
blood and tumor (Table 1). These AUEs represent the
summation of the pharmacodynamic effect over a defined
period of time in a particular tissue compartment. Calculating the tumor to blood AUE ratio provided a functional
reflection of the distribution and durable pharmacodynamic effect of the drug in different tissue compartments. The
maximum level of blood proteasome inhibition (Emax) following an acute i.v. dose of either MLN2238 (83.1%) or
bortezomib (88.3%) was nearly identical (Table 1). However, the duration of the effect differed between the two molecules, with bortezomib having a more sustained response
and, therefore, a greater blood AUE than MLN2238 (Fig. 2B
and D). In contrast to blood, MLN2238 showed both greater maximum and sustained tumor proteasome inhibition
compared with bortezomib in both xenograft models (Table 1; Fig. 2A and C). The tumor to blood AUE ratio for
MLN2238 in CWR22s and WSU-DLCL2s was 1.56 and 2.03,
respectively, compared with 0.69 and 0.26 for bortezomib
(Table 1). Consistent with the pharmacokinetic profiles described for these two molecules (i.e., MLN2238 has a greater Vdss, b ), these results showed that MLN2238 had a
greater pharmacodynamic effect in tumor compared with
blood, whereas the opposite was true for bortezomib. Consistent with the improved tumor Emax in MLN2238-treated
mice, these data confirm that MLN2238 had a greater
overall tumor pharmacodynamic effect than bortezomib
as assessed by 20S inhibition.
Additional pharmacodynamic markers were examined to
study the downstream effects of proteasome inhibition.
One of the consequences of proteasome inhibition is the accumulation of proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway and the unfolded protein
response (UPR) pathway (11, 45–50). One of these proteins
is GADD34, a stress-inducible gene that is also upregulated
in response to DNA damage, hypoxia, and energy depletion

(51). Western blot analyses were performed on tumors isolated from CWR22 and WSU-DLCL2 xenograft-bearing mice
treated with either MLN2238 or bortezomib (Fig. 3). Increased GADD34 expression was seen in CWR22 xenograft
tumors following MLN2238 or bortezomib treatment, whereas an even greater response was seen following MLN2238
treatment (Fig. 3A). Similarly, bortezomib treatment only
led to a minor increase in GADD34 levels in WSU-DLCL2 xenograft tumors, whereas MLN2238 strongly induced its expression (Fig. 3B). To confirm these results, and to get a
better understanding of the magnitude of response across individual cells within the tumor, immunohistochemical staining was performed using the anti-GADD34 antibody
(Proteintech). Strong GADD34 staining, reflecting increases
in GADD34 protein levels, was seen across the majority of
tumor cells in CWR22 xenografts 8 hours after a single i.v.
dose of MLN2238 at 14 mg/kg (Fig. 3D) compared with very
low staining in vehicle-treated CWR22 xenografts (Fig. 3C).
Approximately a 5-fold increase in the total number of
GADD34-positive cells was seen at 8 and 24 hours following
MLN2238 treatment compared with vehicle control–treated
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). In WSU-DLCL2 xenograft
tumors, bortezomib treatment led to only a minor increase
in GADD34 levels measured by Western blot, whereas
MLN2238 strongly induced its expression (Fig. 3B). In
addition, examining levels of ATF3, another gene upregulated
during ER stress and UPR activation (48, 52, 53), revealed a
similar pattern, with a greater number of cells staining positively for ATF3 following treatment of WSU-DLCL2 xenograft tumors with MLN2238 compared with bortezomib
(Supplementary Fig. S2). These results confirm that the improved tumor exposure seen with MLN2238 translated into
an improved tumor pharmacodynamic response both at
the level of and downstream from the proteasome.
MLN2238 shows antitumor activity in the CWR22 xenograft model. To confirm that the pharmacodynamic responses seen in CWR22 xenografts would translate into
antitumor activity, a series of efficacy experiments were performed comparing MLN2238 with bortezomib.
The antitumor effects of MLN2238 dosed at 14 mg/kg i.v.
or 7 mg/kg i.v. were compared with bortezomib dosed at
0.8 mg/kg i.v. or 0.4 mg/kg i.v. on a twice weekly regimen
(Fig. 4A). The high dose for both MLN2238 and bortezomib
showed similar antitumor activity in this model (T/C = 0.36
and 0.44, respectively). However, MLN2238 (7 mg/kg) showed
greater efficacy at a 0.5 MTD dose compared with a 0.5 MTD
dose of bortezomib (0.4 mg/kg; T/C = 0.49 compared with
T/C = 0.79, respectively; Fig. 4A).
MLN2238 has moderate orally bioavailability (Table 1). In
Fig. 4B, we show that oral dosing of MLN2238 resulted in
antitumor activity in the CWR22 xenograft model (T/C =
0.37). Taken together, these results show that the human
prostate CWR22 model is responsive to proteasome inhibition. Furthermore, a direct comparison between MLN2238
and bortezomib revealed similar antitumor activity when
dosed at their respective MTDs; however, when both compounds were dosed at their respective 0.5 MTDs, MLN2238
showed improved activity over bortezomib (Fig. 4A).

MLN2238 shows improved efficacy compared with bortezomib in two models of lymphoma. MLN2238 showed greater tumor pharmacodynamic responses in WSU-DLCL2
xenografts compared with bortezomib (Table 1; Figs. 2 and
3). To assess whether the more robust pharmacodynamic response translated to greater antitumor activity, an efficacy
study was performed in WSU-DLCL2 tumor-bearing mice.
The antitumor effects of MLN2238 [dosed at 14 mg/kg i.v.
twice weekly or 4 mg/kg s.c. once daily (QD)] were directly
compared with bortezomib (dosed at 0.8 mg/kg i.v. twice
weekly or 0.4 mg/kg s.c. QD; Fig. 5A). In this experiment, neither of the bortezomib doses showed strong antitumor activity (T/C = 0.79 and 0.9 for 0.8 mg/kg i.v. and 0.4 mg/kg s.c.,
respectively). In contrast, both intermittent and continuous
MLN2238 dosing regimens showed strong antitumor activity
(T/C = 0.44 and 0.29 for 14 mg/kg i.v. and 4 mg/kg s.c., respectively) and generated a greater apoptotic response in tumor
tissue as measured by levels of cleaved caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The antitumor activity of MLN2238 and bortezomib was
evaluated in a disseminated model of lymphoma. The ability
of both drugs to reduce tumor burden and improve overall survival was assessed in this systemic lymphoma model. NODSCID mice were inoculated with OCI-Ly7-Luc cells expressing
a luciferase reporter gene. Bioluminescent scans, obtained via
quantitative Xenogen imaging, allowed tumor growth to be
tracked over time in live animals. The strongest antitumor
response was seen following treatment with MLN2238 at
4.0 mg/kg s.c. QD (T/C = 0.20; Fig. 5B). This dosing regimen also
significantly prolonged overall survival in this model compared
with vehicle-treated controls (median survival was 54 versus
33 days, P = 0.05; Fig. 5C). Much weaker antitumor responses
were seen following bortezomib treatment at 0.4 mg/kg s.c. QD
or 1.0 mg/kg i.v. once weekly (T/C = 0.86 and 0.76, respectively).
These bortezomib dosing regimens also did not significantly
prolong survival (median survival was 33 and 43 days, respectively; P > 0.99 for both; Fig. 5C).
In summary, we have identified a second-generation
small-molecule inhibitor of the proteasome. It has different
physicochemical properties compared with bortezomib, including a shorter proteasome dissociation t1/2, which we
believe plays a critical role in the ability of this molecule
to distribute into tissues. Improved pharmacokinetic and
tolerability allow this molecule to be administered at higher doses, resulting in greater blood and plasma exposures.
Consistent with these findings, we found a greater pharmacodynamic response in multiple xenograft models treated
with MLN2238 compared with bortezomib, particularly in
tumor, supporting our hypothesis that MLN2238 has improved distribution characteristics. Superior bioavailability
also allows this molecule to be dosed orally, whereas bortezomib is restricted to i.v. and s.c. dosing regimens to
achieve acceptable exposure levels. Data generated from
both s.c. and disseminated xenograft efficacy studies show
that MLN2238 has greater antitumor activity when administered by either intermittent or continuous dosing regimens and improves overall survival compared with
bortezomib. Taken together, these data support the clinical
