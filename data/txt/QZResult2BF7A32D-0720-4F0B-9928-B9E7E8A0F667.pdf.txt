Abstract
The threonine endopeptidase Taspase1 has a critical role in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this
study, we developed and evaluated small molecule inhibitors of Taspase1 as a new candidate class of therapeutic
modalities. Genetic deletion of Taspase1 in the mouse produced no overt deﬁciencies, suggesting the possibility of
a wide therapeutic index for use of Taspase1 inhibitors in cancers. We deﬁned the peptidyl motifs recognized by
Taspase1 and conducted a cell-based dual-ﬂuorescent proteolytic screen of the National Cancer Institute
diversity library to identify Taspase1 inhibitors (TASPIN). On the basis of secondary and tertiary screens the
4-[(4-arsonophenyl)methyl]phenyl] arsonic acid NSC48300 was determined to be the most speciﬁc active
compound. Structure–activity relationship studies indicated a crucial role for the arsenic acid moiety in
mediating Taspase1 inhibition. Additional ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer–based kinetic analysis
characterized NSC48300 as a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of Taspase1 (Ki ¼ 4.22 mmol/L). In the
MMTV-neu mouse model of breast cancer and the U251 xenograft model of brain cancer, NSC48300 produced
effective tumor growth inhibition. Our results offer an initial preclinical proof-of-concept to develop TASPINs for
cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 72(3); 736–46. 2011 AACR.

examples are the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, and 26S proteasome
inhibitors to treat hypertension, AIDS, and multiple myeloma, respectively (2, 11, 12).
Taspase1 (threonine aspartase) encodes a highly conserved
50 kDa a-b proenzyme that undergoes autoproteolysis, generating a mature a28/b22 heterodimeric protease that displays
an overall a/b/b/a structure (13, 14). Taspase1 was initially
puriﬁed as the protease that cleaves MLL to regulate the
expression of HOX genes (13, 15). Subsequent studies identiﬁed
additional Taspase1 substrates, including MLL2 (also known
as MLL4 in the GenBank database; ref. 8), TFIIAa-b, and ALF
(TFIIA like factor; ref. 16). The cloning of Taspase1 founded a
novel class of endopeptidases that employs conserved amino
terminal threonine of the mature b subunit to cleave peptide
bonds after P1 aspartate (13).
Taspase1 is the only protease within the family of enzymes
that possesses an asparaginase_2 (PF01112) homology
domain, whereas other members, including L-asparaginase
and glycosylasparaginase, participate in the metabolism of
asparagines and the ordered breakdown of N-linked glycoproteins, respectively (13, 17). Taspase1-mediated cleavage follows
a distinct aspartate residue of a conserved QXD/GXDD motif
(15), suggesting that Taspase1 evolved from hydrolyzing asparagines and glycosylasparagines to cleaving polypeptides after
aspartates (13). In addition to MLL, MLL2, TFIIA, and ALF,
Taspase1 also proteolyzes Drosophila HCF (dHCF), whereas
mammalian HCF is cleaved by O-GlcNAc transferase due to the
loss of GXD/GXDD motif during the evolution (18, 19).

Targeting Taspase1 for Cancer Therapy

Initial characterization of Taspase1/ mice discovered a
critical role of Taspase1 in cell-cycle control (8). In the
absence of Taspase1, cell cycle is disrupted with decreased
expression of Cyclins and increased expression of CDK
inhibitors (CDKI; ref. 8). Consequently, Taspase1/ mouse
embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) are resistant to oncogenic
transformation (8). Furthermore, Taspase1 is overexpressed
in primary human cancers and required for tumor maintenance in many cancer cell lines (20). Knockdown of Taspase1 disrupts proliferation in the majority of cancer cells
within which a subset of cell lines also displays enhanced
apoptosis (20). Of note, Taspase1 is expressed at high levels
in many cancer cells (8, 21, 22) and in general increased
expression positively correlates with the cellular dependence on Taspase1 (8, 20). These data suggest that Taspase1
is co-opted to promote and sustain tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibition of Taspase1 may offer a new anticancer
strategy. Here, we present our endeavors in (i) establishing
the safety of Taspase1 inactivation in adult mammals
using a genetically well-deﬁned mouse model, (ii) characterizing the consensus cleavage motif of Taspase1, (iii)
developing an in vivo, dual ﬂuorescent, Taspase1 proteolytic
screen, (iv) screening, conﬁrming, and characterizing a
small molecule TASPIN NSC48300, [4-[(4-arsonophenyl)
methyl]phenyl] arsonic acid, and (v) examining the efﬁcacy
of NSC48300 in treating cancers using 2 different preclinical
mouse tumor models.

Materials and Methods
Animal studies
Animal studies were approved by the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University School of Medicine. Mice
carrying straight and conditional knockout alleles of Taspase1
(8), MMTV-neu (23), and MMTV-wnt (24) transgenes have
been described. Tumor mass followed by bioluminescence
imaging using an IVIS 100 system has been previously
described (25).
Constructs, recombinant proteases, cell lines, cell
culture, knockdown, and Western blot analyses
The dual ﬂuorescent Taspase1 proteolytic reporter (DFPR)
was constructed by sequentially inserting cDNA encoding
enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (eGFP), 2XNES of MAPKK,
aa 2,400 to 2,900 of hMLL, 3XNLS of SV40 large T antigen, and
dsRED2 into the pMSCVpuro (Clontech) vector. Amphotropic
retrovirus was produced as described (26) and utilized to infect
293T cells. The generation of recombinant Taspase1 and
caspase8 has been described (13, 27). NCI60 cell lines were
obtained from National Cancer Institute (NCI) Developmental
Therapeutic Program (DTP). BT-474 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Taspase1/ MEFs have been
described (20) and were authenticated by both PCR genotyping
and Western blot analysis. All of the cell lines were expanded,
frozen, and used for no more than 2 months after the resuscitation of frozen aliquots. Cell culture, Taspase1 knockdown,
and Western blot analyses were carried out as previously
described (28).

Results
Acute deletion of Taspase1 in adult mice does not incur
overt toxic phenotypes
Our in vitro studies using Taspase1 knockout and knockdown cells showed an important role of Taspase1 in tumor
initiation and maintenance, suggesting that Taspase1 inhibitors (TASPINs) may be developed and utilized in cancer
therapy (20). Because Taspase1 plays critical roles in mouse
embryonic development, the application of TASPINs in
children and pregnant women would be inadvisable (8). On
the other hand, the few Taspase1/ mice alive at weaning
age went on to live a normal lifespan (Westergard and
colleagues, unpublished data), implicating the safe use of
TASPINs in adults. To evaluate whether Taspase1 can be
safely inactivated in developed mammals, we induced a
global deletion of the Taspase1 gene in 7-week-old MxCre;Taspase1F/ mice by administering polyinosine–polycytidine (pIpC; ref. 29). No discernible toxicities were observed
in these Taspase1/ mice (Fig. 1A–D). The efﬁciency of
Taspase1 deletion in bone marrow, spleen, and thymus was
determined (Fig. 1E). These results indicated that inactivation of Taspase1 through pharmacologic means is likely to
be tolerated by adult mammals.
Critical amino acid residues within the Taspase1
cleavage consensus motif
To provide mechanistic insights about how Taspase1
recognizes its substrates, we characterized the Taspase1
cleavage motif. MLL contains 2 Taspase1 cleavage sites (CS1
and CS2) that are positioned 53 amino acids (aa) apart,
among which CS2 is more conserved and more efﬁciently
processed (Fig. 2A; refs. 13, 30). In vitro transcribed/translated (IVTT), 35S-methionine labeled, human MLL aa 2,500
to 2,800 fragment containing a mutated CS1 site was
employed as a CS2-speciﬁc cleavage reporter (p45MLLCS2).
Alanine scanning mutagenesis across the CS2 site
(PKISQLD/GVDDG) of p45MLLCS2 was done and the cleavage of individual reporters by recombinant Taspase1 (rTaspase1) was examined. P1 aspartate and P1' glycine are
essential, P2 leucine, P3 glutamine, and P5 isoleucine
are important, and P3' and P4' aspartates are dispensable
(Fig. 2B). These data are consistent with the fact that P1
aspartate and P1' glycine are absolutely conserved, P2, P3,
and P5 hydrophobic residues are highly conserved, and P4
is variable, among known Taspase1 cleavage motifs
(Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, highly conserved P3' and P4' aspartate residues are dispensable, indicating that these residues
may play an indirect role in presenting substrates for
Taspase1 recognition. In summary, the IXQL(V)D/G
sequence represents the best Taspase1 cleavage recognition
motif.
Accordingly, primitive peptidomimetic Taspase1 inhibitors,
derivatives of ISQLD carrying common protease-inactivating
functional groups, such as aldehyde and chloromethyl ketone
(cmk), were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit
Taspase1-mediated cleavage of p75MLL (aa 2,400–2,900).
Although aldehyde and cmk are effective warheads against

indicated alleles of Taspase1 (þ, wild type; -, knockout; F, conditional allele) at 7 weeks of age were subjected to 5 doses of pIpC injection. Baseline

bone marrow (BM), spleen, and thymus for genotypic analysis. B–D, genetic deletion of Taspase1 does not affect the parameters of white blood cell (B), platelet

general classes of proteases (31), ISQLD-aldehyde and ISQLDcmk were minimally active in inhibiting Taspase1 (IC50 > 100
mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Of all proteases in mammals,
the b subunit of the 20S proteasome (32) is the only known Nterminal threonine endopeptidase other than Taspase1 (13).
Bortezomib—a boronic acid containing chemotherapeutic
drug that targets the active site threonine of the 26S proteasome (11)—has no activity against Taspase1 (Supplementary
Fig. S1B), which is consistent with the lack of activity of ISQLDboronate in inhibiting Taspase1 (33). Altogether, these data
highlighted the unique mechanistic processes about Taspase1mediated proteolysis.

distribution of green signal (eGFP/NES-p47MLL) in the cytosol
and red signal (p28MLL-NLS/dsRED2) in the nucleus. Inhibition of Taspase1 would prevent cleavage of newly synthesized
DFPR and result in the accumulation of yellow ﬂuorescence.
DFPR-expressing cells were screened against the NCI Diversity
Set library, which identiﬁed 50 candidate inhibitors that induce
varying degrees of colocalization of red–green ﬂuorescence
(Fig. 3). A secondary conﬁrmation screen using an established
Taspase1-based in vitro cleavage assay was carried out (13).
Among candidate inhibitors, 5 showed appreciable inhibition
of Taspase1-mediated cleavage of p75MLL in vitro (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Table S1). To further characterize these small
molecule TASPINs, a tertiary speciﬁcity screen was employed,
in which caspase8-mediated cleavage of p22Bid was utilized to
identify dual Taspase1–caspase8 inhibitors (27). Caspase8 was
chosen because caspases, like Taspase1, proteolyze their substrates after P1 aspartate. The IVTT-based, caspase8-p22Bid in
vitro cleavage assay was optimized (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Interestingly, 4 of the 5 TASPINs were dual Taspase1–caspase8
inhibitors and compound #4 (NSC48300) speciﬁcally targeted
Taspase1 (Fig. 3). Taken together, our cell-based screen, followed by in vitro conﬁrmation and speciﬁcity assays, identiﬁed
NSC48300 as a speciﬁc TASPIN.
Characteristics and structure–activity relationships of
TASPIN NSC48300
The activity of TASPIN NSC48300 was evaluated using the
IVTT, 35S methionine-labeled p75MLL reporter, which showed
an IC50 around 7.5 mmol/L (Fig. 4A). The mechanisms by which
NSC48300 inhibits Taspase1 were further investigated. We ﬁrst
determined whether it effects as a reversible or irreversible
inhibitor. Preincubation of Taspase1 with NSC48300 for
extended periods of time did not enhance inhibition, favoring

www.aacrjournals.org

a reversible mechanism (Fig. 4B). As NSC48300 is an arsonic
acid, we assessed whether free arsenic acid can inactivate
Taspase1. Up to 1 mmol/L of arsenic acid was utilized and
no detectable inhibition of Taspase1 was observed (Fig. 4A).
Nevertheless, the arsenic acid moiety of NSC48300 seems to be
essential in that its analogues NSC74084, NSC47905, NSC23953,
and NSC352678, have no demonstrable activity (Fig. 4C). In
addition, modiﬁcations of the benzene ring, as illustrated in
arylarsonic acid NSC49855, resulted in a 10-fold decrease of the
inhibitory activity (Fig. 4C). In summary, NSC48300 functions
as a reversible TASPIN and arsenic acid may serve as an active
functional group against Taspase1 when correctly conjugated
onto appropriate chemical backbones.
Kinetic analysis of NSC48300 using a FRET-based
cleavage reporter
To enable detailed kinetic analysis of TASPINs, we modiﬁed
an in vitro FRET (ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer)based Taspase1 cleavage assay (14). The FRET-based Taspase1
proteolytic reporter (FRPR, MCA-KISQLDGVDD-DNP) consists of the 10 aa CS2 consensus sequence conjugated with
a ﬂuorogenic coumarin (MCA) group and a quenching 2,4dinitrophenyl (DNP) group at the amino and carboxy terminus,
respectively (Fig. 5A). Upon Taspase1-mediated cleavage, MCA
is no longer quenched by DNP, resulting in a linear increase of
ﬂuorescence emission that is excited at 328 nm and detected
at 393 nm (Fig. 5B). The apparent KM of FRPR is 9.06 
2.80 mmol/L (Fig. 5C). By incubating varying concentrations
of FRPR and NSC48300, we showed NSC48300 as a noncompetitive TASPIN (Ki ¼ 4.22  0.46 mmol/L; Fig. 5C). To conﬁrm
the noncompetitive nature of NSC48300 in inhibiting Taspase1,
we employed HTI-9 (ISQLAGVDD), a weak, CS2-based, competitive peptide inhibitor of Taspase1 (Supplementary Fig. S3A

and S3B). The fact that NSC48300 and HTI-9 cooperated to
inhibit Taspase1 indicates that these 2 inhibitors function at
distinct sites. It conﬁrms NSC48300 as a nonsubstrate competitive inhibitor and reveals the presence of a yet to be
characterized allosteric site on Taspase1 (Fig. 5D).
NSC48300 does not inhibit the intramolecular
autoproteolysis of Taspase1
Our data thus far support a working model in which
NSC48300 targets an allosteric site and thereby noncompetitively inhibits Taspase1. However, it remains plausible that
NSC48300 can further function by interfering the maturation
step of Taspase1, that is, autoproteolysis. Taspase1 is translated
as a nonprocessed a-b precursor enzyme which undergoes
autoproteolysis to generate mature a/b protease (13). Taspase1
precursors can be activated by intramolecular autoproteolysis.
However, whether these precursors can also be activated by
mature Taspase1 through intermolecular autoproteolysis
remains undetermined. To probe into the mechanism by which
Taspase1 matures, radiolabeled Taspase1 precursor (p50T1a-b)
was incubated in cleavage buffer alone. A slow rate of autopro-

740

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

teolysis with approximately 50% maturation after 6 hours of
incubation was observed (Fig. 5E). If p50T1a-b can be activated
by intermolecular autoproteolysis, the addition of puriﬁed
rTaspase1 would greatly expedite the maturation of labeled
p50T1a-b. No enhanced cleavage of p50T1a-b was observed
upon the addition of up to 100 ng of rTaspase1, indicating the
lack of intermolecular autoproteolysis (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Altogether, Taspase1 precursors undergo intramolecular, but
not intermolecular, autoproteolysis to generate mature Taspase1 enzyme. With this information in hand, increasing
amounts of NSC48300 were added to the autoproteolysis reaction and no impact on the Taspase1 autoproteolysis was
observed (Fig. 5F), excluding the possibility that NSC48300
inhibits Taspase1 through disrupting autoproteolysis.
The expression level of Taspase1 in breast and brain
cancer cell lines correlates with sensitivity to NSC48300
With a speciﬁc TASPIN in hand, we explored its potential
application in treating cancer cells. Knockdown studies using
cancer cell lines showed that cells with higher expression of
Taspase1 are more dependent on Taspase1 (20). Hence, we

Targeting Taspase1 for Cancer Therapy

envisioned that certain cancer types might exhibit a strong
correlation between their Taspase1 expression and sensitivity
to NSC48300. To examine this hypothesis, we ﬁrst employed
SV40-transformed Taspase1/ MEFs that are stably reconstituted with Taspase1 (Taspase1/;Taspase1). When compared with the congenic parental Taspase1/ cell line,
Taspase1/;Taspase1 cells displayed increased sensitivity to
NSC48300, indicating that the presence of Taspase1 renders
treatment sensitivity (Fig. 6A). We next integrated the Taspase1 protein expression proﬁle and the NSC48300 growth
inhibition database of the NCI60 cancer cell lines (8, 34).
According to the NCI DTP database (35), NSC48300 produces
a distinct pattern of growth inhibition in the NCI60 in vitro
anticancer drug screen (Supplementary Table S2). The sensitivity to NSC48300-mediated growth inhibition is in general
agreement with the protein level of Taspase1 in many human

www.aacrjournals.org

cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table S2), among which an
especially tight correlation is detected in breast and brain
cancer cells (Fig. 6B and C, left panels). The differential
sensitivity to NSC48300 within these 2 cancer types was
conﬁrmed (Fig. 6B and C, right panels), supporting Taspase1
as a target of NSC48300 in treating cancer cells. However, when
high concentrations of NSC48300 were utilized, nonspeciﬁc
toxicity became evident, which could relate to its intrinsic
arsenic acid moiety or effects on other cellular enzymes.
NSC48300 was recently shown to inhibit autotaxin, an extracellular enzyme that converts lysophosphatidylcholine to lipophosphatidic acid (LPA; ref. 36). The lysophospholipase D
activity of autotoxin can be inhibited by NSC48300, resulting
in the disruption of LPA production and a subsequent decrease
of the in vitro invasiveness of cancer cells, which can be
reversed by adding extracellular LPA (36). To examine whether

concentrations of NSC48300. Data presented are mean  SD of 3 independent experiments. D, hundred nmol/L of Taspase1 was preincubated for 30 minutes

presence of indicated concentrations of NSC48300.

our observed cancer cell sensitivity to NSC48300 can be
partially attributed to the inhibition of autotaxin, we treated
cancer cells with NSC48300 in the presence or absence of LPA.
Because the relative cell number curves basically overlaid
irrespective of LPA in both NSC48300 sensitive and insensitive
lines, we excluded autotaxin as a target for NSC48300-mediated growth inhibition, which is consistent with the known
extracellular expression and action of autotaxin (Fig. 6B and C,
right panels).
NSC48300 inhibits the growth of MMTV-neu mouse
breast cancers and U251 brain tumor xenografts
Following up on the cell line data, we wished to evaluate the
in vivo efﬁcacy of NSC48300 in treating cancers. Because
NSC48300 is an arsonic acid and no data with regard to its
in vivo safety have been reported, we determined its toxicity
proﬁle. Short-term, instead of long-term, tail vein injections
were given due to observed ﬁbrotic damages of regional vessels
at injection sites upon repetitive treatment of NSC48300.
Histologic examination of major organs did not reveal any
obvious abnormalities, whereas blood chemistry revealed a
signiﬁcant decrease in the LDH level and certain alterations in
electrolytes and kidney functions (Supplementary Fig. S5 and

showed a decrease in white blood cell counts and hemoglobin
levels (Supplementary Fig. S6A–C).
To enable a scientiﬁc selection of the most relevant breast
cancer model for in vivo experiments, we expanded our breast
cancer cell line repertoire to incorporate an estrogen receptor
(ER) negative, Her2/neu overexpressing cancer cell line, BT474
(37), and conducted genetic knockdown experiments (Supplementary Fig. S7). Among these 3 breast cancer cell lines, MDAMB-231 cells, an ER negative, Her2/neu negative cell line (38)
that expresses a very low level of Taspase1, were least affected
by the deﬁciency of Taspase1 (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig.
S7; ref. 20). By contrast, cells with higher levels of Taspase1,
including MCF7, an ER positive, Her2/neu negative cell line
(39), and BT-474 cells were more dependent on Taspase1 (Fig.
7A and Supplementary Fig. S7). On the basis of these in vitro
data, Her2/neu-driven tumors may be more dependent on
Taspase1 and would be more sensitive to NSC48300 treatment,
whereas ER negative, Her2/neu negative breast cancers would
be resistant. To examine this hypothesis in vivo, we treated
MMTV-neu (23) or MMTV-wnt (ER-, Her2-; ref. 24) breast
cancer–bearing mice with NSC48300. Indeed, NSC48300 consistently disrupted the growth of MMTV-neu breast cancers,
whereas it exhibited no effects on the growth of MMTV-wnt
breast cancers (Fig. 7B).

Targeting Taspase1 for Cancer Therapy

Figure 6. The cellular sensitivity to
NSC48300 correlates with the
protein expression of Taspase1.
A, the indicated MEFs were treated
with 1 mmol/L of NSC48300 for
2 days and the relative cell number
was measured by MTT assays.
Values obtained from the parental
/
MEFs after NSC48300
Taspase1
treatment were designated as 1.
Data presented are mean  SD of 3
independent experiments. B, the
NSC48300 GI50 (growth inhibition
50%) data were acquired through a
publically available database (35). To
compare relative sensitivity among
different brain tumor cell lines, log
(GI50) values of each individual lines
were obtained. The SDs of individual
GI50 from the mean were plotted
(positive values indicate higher
sensitivity). The protein levels of
Taspase1 in the indicated cell lines
have been reported and are
represented as a bar graph. The
indicated brain cancer cell lines were
treated with increasing
concentration of NSC48300 for
2 days plus or minus 100 nmol/L LPA
and then subjected to MTT assays.
Data presented are mean  SD of 2
triplicate independent experiments.
C, a positive correlation of Taspase1
protein levels and cellular sensitivity
to NSC48300 in the NCI60 breast
tumor cell lines. Data collection,
experimentations, and analyses
were carried out as described in B on
the indicated breast cancer cell lines.

To test the efﬁcacy of NSC48300 in treating brain tumors, we
employed a brain cancer xenograft model using U251 cells
based on 2 reasons. First, knockdown of Taspase1 in U251 cells
impaired cell proliferation (20). Second, among the NCI60
brain tumor cell lines, U251 cells express high levels of Taspase1 and are most sensitive to NSC48300 treatment in vitro.
To monitor treatment response in live animals, U251 cells were
ﬁrst engineered to stably express ﬁreﬂy luciferase (fLuc) before
subcutaneous implantation into mice. Bioluminescent imaging showed a stasis of tumor growth in NSC48300-treated
compared with vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 7C). In summary,
our in vivo preclinical efﬁcacy trials showed an antitumor effect
of NSC48300 in both MMTV-neu breast cancer and U251 GBM
xenograft models.

Discussion
In the evolution of cancer, individual cells must overcome a
multitude of challenges and eventually exhibit hallmarks of

www.aacrjournals.org

cancer, a process demanding multiple oncogenes and nononcogenes that function cooperatively to achieve and maintain
the aberrant, oncogenic state. The evolved reliance of oncogenes on particular sets of subordinate nononcogenes during
tumorigenesis, offering a novel anticancer treatment strategy
aiming at tumor dependent, nononcogenes (40). Thus far, wellcharacterized tumor dependent, nononcogenic actors are
scarce, including the 26S proteasome, HSF1 (41), and IRF4
(42), which handles the rapid protein turnover, mediates the
stress response, and maintains expression of the MYC oncogene, respectively. The fact that the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib is effective against multiple myeloma in human
patients substantiates this new anticancer therapeutic concept
(11). Successful application of this strategy in cancer therapy
relies on the identiﬁcation and characterization of tumor
dependent, nononcogenic factors that cancer but not normal
cells heavily rely on.
Taspase1 by itself or in conjunction with MYC, RAS, or E1A
fails to transform NIH/3T3 cells or primary MEFs, respectively,

Figure 7. NSC48300 disrupts breast and brain cancer growth in mouse cancer models. A, the indicated human breast cancer cell lines with control (sh-scr) or
Taspase1 (sh-T1) knockdown were plated, and cell numbers were counted 4 days after the initial plating. The average cell number of control knockdown
cells was assigned as 1. Data presented are mean  SD of 3 independent experiments. B, tumor-bearing MMTV-neu or MMTV-wnt mice were treated at day 0
when de novo tumors reached 1 cm at the longest dimension. NSC48300 was given at the indicated doses every other day for a total of 5 intravenous
injections. Graphs represent the relative tumor volume throughout the course of treatment. The tumor size measured at day 0 immediately before treatment
was assigned as 1. Data presented are mean  SD of the indicated number of tumors of each arm. C, U251 cells transduced with a luciferase
/
mice at 6 to 8 weeks of age (day 1). Mice were then treated on days 0, 2, and 4 with
reporter were implanted into the ﬂanks of male NOD-scid IL2Rg
the indicated dose of NSC48300. Tumor mass was determined by bioluminescent imaging using an IVIS 100 and representative bioluminescent images
are presented. The graph represents mean  SD of 4 tumors from each arm. The absolute bioluminescence was normalized to a value of 1 at day 0.

yet is required for efﬁcient cancer initiation and maintenance
(20). Hence, Taspase1 functions as a tumor dependent, nononcogenic protease, whose inhibition may offer an anticancer
strategy. However, Taspase1 is highly conserved and known to
regulate embryonic development (8). The severe perinatal
lethality resulting from the embryonic loss of Taspase1 suggests that inactivation of Taspase1 by genetic or pharmacologic
means is inadvisable in pregnant females and children to avoid
potential developmental sequelae. In contrast, inactivation of
Taspase1 in fully developed adult mammals seems to be well
tolerated. Cancer commonly hijacks key developmental pathways during tumorigenesis and thus frequently exhibits unique
properties, which may underlie the preferential therapeutic
beneﬁt conferred by targeting Taspase1 to treat cancers.
Through proteolytic processing of nuclear transcription
regulators, Taspase1 controls cellular proliferation by suppressing and activating the expression of CDKIs and cyclins,
respectively (8, 20). Although knockdown of Taspase1 affects

744

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

proliferation in many cancer cell lines, candidate cancer types
that may respond to Taspase1 inhibition in vivo remain
unclear. Unlike activating mutations of epidermal growth
factor receptor and BCR-ABL that can serve as powerful
biomarkers for selecting responsive cancers (43), Taspase1
dose not function like a classical oncogene and is not mutated
in cancers (COSMIC, Sanger Institute). Data thus far indicate a
positive correlation between Taspase1 protein levels and the
underlying dependence, which provides a useful primary tool
in identifying potentially susceptible cancers. Our prior knockdown experiments showed an in vitro and in vivo reliance of
U251 brain cancer cells on Taspase1 for a full cancer phenotype
(20). Here, we show treatment response of U251 cells to
TASPIN NSC48300 in both cell culture and xenograft models.
Hence, genetic knockdown experiments in cancer cells could
reﬂect the cellular dependence on Taspase1 and thus provide
assessment of in vivo responsiveness of individual cancers to
TASPINs.

Targeting Taspase1 for Cancer Therapy

In addition to brain tumors, we expanded our in vivo studies
to incorporate breast cancer models. Deﬁciency in Taspase1 by
genetic knockdown disrupts the proliferation of Her2/neuþ
human BT-474 breast cancer cells, suggesting that Her2-neuþ
breast cancer may be sensitive to the inactivation of Taspase1.
Indeed, de novo breast cancers developed in MMTV-neu mice
responded to the treatment with NSC48300, whereas MMTVwnt breast cancers were insensitive. Consistent with the
treatment effects, mammary tissue–speciﬁc knockout of
Taspase1 disrupts MMTV-neu–driven, but not MMTV-wnt–
driven, breast carcinogenesis (Van Tine and colleagues, unpublished data). Taspase1 seems to play an important role in the
Her2/neu growth factor signaling pathway, whereas WNT
signals apparently bypass Taspase1-mediated oncogenic
events. These data highlight the heterogeneity underlying
individual tumorigenesis and the importance of selecting the
responsive cancers that may beneﬁt from treatment with
TASPINs. Further studies with regard to the involvement of
Taspase1 in various oncogenic pathways and the pathogenesis

of subtypes of cancers would offer a better target cancer
selection for the potential use of TASPINs in the future.
