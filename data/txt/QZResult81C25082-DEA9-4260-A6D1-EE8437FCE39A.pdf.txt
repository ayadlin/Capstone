BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the influence of race/ethnicity and tumor subtype in
pathologic complete response (pCR) following treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: A total of
2074 patients diagnosed with breast cancer between 1994 and 2008 who were treated with neoadjuvant anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy were included. pCR was defined as no residual invasive cancer in the breast
and axilla. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit was used to calculate survival outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models
were fitted to determine the relationship of patient and tumor variables with outcome. RESULTS: The median patient
age was 50 years; 14.6% of patients were black, were 15.2% Hispanic, 64.3% were white, and 5.9% were of other race.
There were no differences in pCR rates among race/ethnicity (12.3% in black, 14.2% in Hispanics, 12.3% in whites, and
11.5% in others, P Â¼ .788). Lack of pCR, breast cancer subtype, grade 3 tumors, and lymphovascular invasion were
associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) (P  .0001). Differences in RFS by
race/ethnicity were noted in the patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (P Â¼ .007). On multivariate analysis,
Hispanics had improved RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.49-0.97) and OS (HR,
0.63; 95% CI, 0.41-0.97); blacks had a trend toward worse outcomes (RFS: HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.97-1.68] and OS: HR,
1.32 [95% CI, 0.97-1.81]) when compared with whites. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients, race/ethnicity was
not found to be significantly associated with pCR rates. On a multivariate analysis, improved outcomes were
observed in Hispanics and a trend toward worse outcomes in black patients, when compared with white patients.
Further research was needed to explore the potential differences in biology and outcomes. Cancer 2010;116:4168â€“77.

Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death among women in the United States. In 2009, more

than 194,280 new cases were diagnosed and it is estimated that 40,610 deaths will occur.1 Despite the reduction in mortality rates across all ethnic groups over time, clear survival disparities exist between women of different racial groups.
Reports obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program indicate higher age-adjusted
mortality rates for black women compared with white women; this disparity is present among women aged > and <50
years.2 Several social, economic, and biological factors have been extensively studied to explain the observed racial disparities.3-6 Compared with whites, young black women have higher incidence of triple receptor-negative tumors, which could
provide in part, the biological explanation of the poor prognosis noted in this group of patients.5,7-9 To our knowledge,
less information is available regarding Hispanics, but compared with whites, they appear to be more likely to have high-

tumors, and a greater number of positive lymph nodes at
diagnosis.7,10-12
Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is the standard
approach to treat women with locally advanced and
inflammatory breast cancer and is now being used in
patients with earlier stage disease. By downstaging
tumors; NST most likely improves available surgical
options while concurrently allowing for in vivo assessment
of chemosensitivity. Furthermore, attaining a pathologic
complete response (pCR) after NST has been shown by
several investigators to be a surrogate marker for improved
long-term outcome, possibly due to the eradication of distant micrometastatic residual disease.13-19 A retrospective
study from our institution demonstrated a survival benefit
for patients who achieved a pCR compared with those
who did not, regardless of hormone receptor status.20
Unfortunately, NST using conventional anthracylineand/or taxane-based regimens results in pCR rates of only
8% to 31%.15,17,21,22
The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between race/ethnicity, pCR, and survival outcomes after treatment with anthracycline- and taxanebased neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We also attempted to
explore whether differences in pCR according to race
were present among the different tumor subtypes. The
interaction between race/ethnicity and pCR, according to
recurrence-free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS) was
also evaluated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Patients treated with NST were identified in a prospectively maintained database in the Breast Medical Oncology Department at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC). A total of 2074
female patients diagnosed with invasive primary breast
cancer between 1994 and 2008 and treated with anthracycline- and taxane-based NST were included. We excluded
female patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis and
bilateral breast cancer and all male patients. The variables
recorded included patient demographics (race, age, and
menopausal status), tumor characteristics (histology;
grade; lymphovascular invasion; and estrogen receptor
[ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 [HER-2] status), clinical stage at
diagnosis (based on the criteria proposed by the American
Joint Committee on Cancer Criteria version VI23), type

of surgery, pathologic stage, and recurrence and survival
information
Race information was self-reported based on data
derived from forms completed by the patient on her first
visit to our institution. The race/ethnicity groups evaluated were white, black, Hispanic, and other. All pathology specimens were reviewed by dedicated breast
pathologists at UTMDACC. Histologic type and grade
were defined according to the World Health Organization
classification system24 and modified Black nuclear grade
system,25 respectively. All surgical breast and axillary
lymph node specimens were reviewed centrally by dedicated breast pathologists to identify the presence or absence of residual disease. pCR was defined as no residual
invasive cancer in both the breast and the axillary lymph
nodes.
Treatment
All patients were treated with a multidisciplinary
approach, and they received NST with an anthracyclineand taxane-based regimen. Taxanes administered
included paclitaxel at a dose of 175 to 250 mg/m2
intravenously (iv) on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles,
paclitaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 doses, or
docetaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m2 iv on Day 1 every 3
weeks for 4 cycles. Anthracycline regimens included 3
to 6 cycles of 1 of the following: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
at a dose of 500 mg/m2, epirubicin at a dose of 100
mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg/m2
iv on Day 1 every 3 weeks; 5-FU at a dose of 500 mg/
m2 on Days 1 and 4, epirubicin at a dose of 75 mg/m2,
and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg/m2 iv on
Day 1 every 3 weeks (FEC 75); 5-FU at a dose of 500
mg/m2 iv on Days 1 and 4, doxorubicin at a dose of 50
mg/m2 iv by continuous infusion over 72 hours, and
cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg/m2 on Day 1
every 3 weeks; or doxorubicin at a dose of 60 mg/m2
and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 600 mg/m2 iv on
Day 1 every 3 weeks. From the 468 patients with HER2/neu-positive tumors, 55.6% (n Â¼ 260) received neoadjuvant trastuzumab at a dose of 4 mg/kg on Day 1
followed by 2 mg/kg weekly during 24 weeks. This regimen was given in combination with paclitaxel (225 mg/
m2 every 3 weeks or 80 mg/m2 weekly) followed by
FEC 75. To account for the effect of time in the selection of systemic therapy, we evaluated the distribution
of the included patients according to their race/ethnicity
by year of inclusion. After NST, all patients underwent
definitive surgery. The decision for or against breast-

conserving surgery was made based on recommendations made by the multidisciplinary team and patient
preferences. The Institution Review Board of UTMDACC approved the study.

Statistical Analysis and Outcome Measures
We computed descriptive statistics. Patient characteristics
were compared by pCR status and by race/ethnicity
groups with a chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as
appropriate. OS was calculated from the date of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response assessment (time of surgery)
to the date of death or last follow-up. RFS was calculated
from the date of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response
assessment (time of surgery) to the date of first local or distant metastasis or last follow-up. Patients who died before
experiencing a disease recurrence were considered censored at their date of death in the analysis of RFS.
Survival outcomes were estimated according to the
Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and groups were
compared with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were built to evaluate the association of pCR,
race/ethnicity, and the interaction between the 2, with
survival outcomes after adjustment for other patient and
disease characteristics. All variables that were found to be
significantly associated with race/ethnicity, pCR, and/or
OS (P <.05) were considered for inclusion in the multivariable model. Test for interaction between race/ethnicity and pCR was evaluated in a model that included each
of the survival outcomes. Age at diagnosis as a continuous
variable, rather than menopausal status, was retained in
the final model due to its clinical significance rather than
statistical significance. Model selection was based on a
backward selection procedure in which all variables of interest were included in a full model, and then variables
were retained according to their 2-sided P values
(P <.05).
We also considered the effect of race/ethnicity on
pCR rates and survival outcomes within the 3 different
breast cancer subtypes defined by receptor status: hormone receptor positive (ER or PR positive and HER-2
negative), HER-2 positive (regardless of hormone receptor status), and triple receptor negative (hormone receptor
and HER-2 negative). The final model included breast
cancer subtype, age at diagnosis, nuclear grade, lymphovascular invasion, and disease stage. P values <.05 were
considered statistically significant; all tests were 2-sided.
All analyses were performed using R 2.7.2 and SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
A total of 2074 patients were included; the median age
was 50 years (range, 21-83 years). Three hundred two
(14.6%) patients were black, 316 (15.2%) were Hispanic,
1334 (64.3%) were white, and 122 (5.9%) were of other
race. Patients who were black or white tended to be postmenopausal and have older age at diagnosis (P <.0001),
compared with those who were Hispanic or other race.
Patients who were black tended to have higher clinical
stage (P Â¼ .004) and higher nuclear grade (P Â¼ .0001), as
well as triple receptor-negative disease more frequently (P
Â¼ .003). Patient characteristics by race/ethnicity group
are shown in Table 1.
Two hundred sixty patients (12.5%) achieved a
pCR. Compared with patients who did not achieved a
pCR, those who did tended to have higher nuclear grade
disease (P <.0001), no lymphovascular invasion (P
<.0001), and tumors that were HER-2 positive or triple
receptor negative (P <.0001). There were no differences
in pCR rates noted among racial/ethnic groups (12.3% in
black, 14.2% in Hispanic, 12.3% in white, and 11.5% in
other race patients; P Â¼ .788). When patients were stratified by tumor subtype, Hispanics appeared to have higher
pCR rates compared with whites, but this difference did
not achieve statistical significance. Race/ethnicity was not
found to be significantly associated with obtaining a pCR
within any of the receptor subgroups. pCR rates according
to race and breast cancer subgroup are shown in Table 2.
The median follow-up was 30 months (range, 0-138
months). Among all patients, there were 438 recurrences
(21.1%) and the RFS rate at 5 years was 70.8% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 68.3-73.5%). Fifty-seven
patients died before experiencing a recurrence (35 white
patients, 9 Hispanic patients,12 black patients, and 1
patient of other race). Patients who achieved pCR had
longer RFS compared with patients who did not (91.44%
vs 67.88% at the end of 5 years; P <.0001). The 5-year
unadjusted RFS estimates were 60.2% (95% CI, 53.068.3%) for blacks, 75.8% (95% CI, 69.6-82.5%) for Hispanics, 71.7% (95% CI, 68.6-74.9%) for whites, and
75.7% (95% CI, 66.1-86.7%) for other race, (P <.0001).
pCR was associated with improved RFS regardless of
race/ethnicity subgroup, and there was no evidence of an
interaction between race/ethnicity and pCR. Figure 1
shows RFS by pCR groups for each of the race/ethnicity
subgroups, and Table 2 shows RFS estimates. When
examining RFS rates by race, according to breast cancer
subtype, no difference was noted between patients with
HER2-positive tumors or with triple receptor-negative

tumors. However, among patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors the estimated percentage of patients
alive and free of disease recurrence at 5 years was lower for
black patients (70.2%; 95% CI, 60.0-82.1%) compared
with Hispanic patients (86.1%; 95%CI, 78.4-94.6%),
white patients (78.6%; 95% CI, 74.6-82.9%), and
patients of other race (82.6%; 95% CI, 70.4-96.9%) (P Â¼
.007). In addition, among all patients, age >50 years (P Â¼
.009), peri/postmenopausal status (P Â¼ .019), hormone
receptor-positive disease (P <.0001), early clinical stage
(P <.0001), low tumor grade (P <.0001), and absence of
lymphovascular invasion (P <.0001) were found to be
associated with improved RFS.
There were a total of 327 deaths and the OS rate at 5
years was 75.7% (95% CI, 73.1-78.4%). The results were
similar to RFS, except that menopausal status and age at
diagnosis did not retain statistical significance. Table 2
shows the 5-year OS estimates. Patients who achieved
pCR had better survival compared with those who did not
(93.6% versus 73.21% at 5 years; P <.0001). The unadjusted 5-year OS estimates were 57% (95% CI, 48.866.5%) for black patients, 78% (95% CI, 72.0-86.5%)
for Hispanic patients, 79% (95% CI, 75.1-81.2%) for
white patients, and 84% (95% CI, 74.0-94.8%) for
patients of other race (P <.0001). Figure 1 shows OS
curves by pCR for each of the race/ethnicity subgroups;
inspection of the curves indicates no interaction between
pCR and race/ethnicity. When examining OS by race
according to breast cancer subtype, we observed that black
patients had decreased crude rates of OS when compared
with other races/ethnicities. Among patients with HER-2positive tumors, 5-year OS rates were 61.4% (95% CI,
44.8-84.0%) in black patients, 84.8% (95% CI, 75.195.6%) in Hispanic patients, 80.7% (95% CI, 74.887.1%) in white patients, and 95.8% (95% CI, 88.2100%) in patients of other race (P Â¼ .001). The 5-year
OS rates for patients with hormone receptor-positive
tumors were 64.0% (95% CI, 51.7-79.3%) for black
patients, 88.1% (95% CI, 78.5-98.5%) in Hispanic
patients, 87.2% (95% CI, 83.6-91.0%) in white patients,
and 74.0% (95% CI, 58.0-94.4%) in patients of other
race (P <.0001). Among women with triple receptor-negative breast cancer, the crude survival rates were 51.2%
(95% CI, 39.2-67.0%) in black patients, 70.5% (95%
CI, 56.1-88.5%) in Hispanic patients, 54.8% (95% CI,
47.3-63.5%) in white patients, and 91.3% (95% CI,

statistically significant for RFS (P Â¼ .53) or OS (P Â¼ .73),
and therefore it was not included in the final models. After
adjustments were made, patients who achieved a pCR
were found to have a significantly decreased risk of both
disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; 95% CI,
0.13-0.36) and death (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10-0.34)
compared to patients who did not achieve a pCR. Compared with white patients, Hispanic patients had a 31%
reduction in the risk of disease recurrence (HR, 0.69;
95% CI, 0.49-0.97), and black patients had a 28%
increase in the risk of disease recurrence, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (HR, 1.28; 95%
CI, 0.97-1.68). For OS, compared with white patients,
Hispanics had a 37% reduction in the risk of death (HR,
0.63; 95% CI, 0.41-0.97), and black patients had a trend
toward an increase in the risk of death (HR, 1.32; 95%
CI, 0.97-1.81). Patients of other races/ethnicities were
not significantly different from white patients for both
RFS and OS. To evaluate whether the observed differences in outcome were significantly affected by the small
sample size, we built a multivariable model including the
1814 patients who did not achieve a pCR. Compared
with white patients, Hispanics tended to have a reduction
in the risk of disease recurrence (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.521.04); black patients tended to have an increase in the risk
of recurrence of the same magnitude as that observed for
the cohort of patients who achieved a pCR (HR, 1.32;
95% CI, 1.00-1.75). For OS, using white patients as a reference category, similar estimates were noted, but they did
not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.67 [95% CI,
0.43-1.57] and HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.95-1.82]).
No differences in the type of chemotherapy or proportion of patients receiving neoadjuvant trastuzumab
according to race/ethnicity were observed. To account for
the effect of time in the selection of systemic therapy, we
evaluated the distribution of the included patients according to their race/ethnicity by year of inclusion. No difference in the race/ethnicity inclusion, according to 5-year
cohorts, was observed.

DISCUSSION

effect of race/ethnicity and survival outcomes in patients

with breast cancer treated with anthracycline- and taxanebased chemotherapy. In this large, single-institution
study, we demonstrated that pCR rates are not related to
race. We did not find a significant association between
race/ethnicity and the likelihood of achieving a pCR. Furthermore, achieving a pCR was found to have a similar
association with survival outcomes in each of the race/ethnicity subgroups. Consistent with other reports,20,26 the
results of the current study indicate that regardless of race,
patients who achieved a pCR after anthracycline- and taxane-based NST had better RFS and OS compared with
patients who did not achieve a pCR.
After adjustment for patient and disease characteristics, we found that Hispanic patients had significantly better RFS and OS compared with patients in other race/
ethnicity groups. Black patients tended to have worse RFS
and OS compared with patients in other race/ethnicity
groups, but such differences did not achieve statistical significance. It is important to note that black patients
tended to have disease characteristics associated with
worse prognosis; of interest, the largest survival differences

among blacks were observed in the hormone receptorpositive group. To the best of our knowledge, limited data
are available with regard to outcomes in Hispanic
patients. However, in a large population-based study that
included 124,934 breast cancer patients, Li et al27 found
that, after adjusting for stage, hormone receptor status,
and surgical and radiation treatments, Hispanics had similar mortality rates compared with non-Hispanic whites
(HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3). Contrary results were found
in black patients who tended to have worse outcomes
(HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.6). Recent data from the SEER
program2 indicate that, from 2002 through 2006, the age
US adjusted overall mortality rates from breast cancer
were lower for Hispanics (15.5/100,000) and higher for
blacks (33.0/100,000) when compared with whites (23.9/
100,000). Similar estimates were observed when examining only the 17 SEER areas. The improved health outcomes observed in Hispanic populations is a
phenomenon described and referred to as the Hispanic
paradox. This term specifically refers to the epidemiologic
finding that Hispanics in the United States paradoxically

tend to have substantially better health outcomes than the
average population despite what their aggregate socioeconomic indicators would predict.28-31 The factors responsible for this observation are poorly understood. Even if
underclassification of outcomes, migration, and acculturation play a role, it appears that unrecognized biological,
environmental, cultural, and lifestyle factors could be important to understand these differences.30-33
Several studies have demonstrated that black women
tend to present with more advanced stages at diagnosis
and also have disease characteristics associated with worse
outcomes, however, it is likely that the differences in outcomes that have been described are a result not only of differences in biology, but also differences in the patterns of
care, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, as well as access
to health insurance and medical coverage.3-6,8,34,35
Woodward et al36 explored the effect of race on survival in
patients treated at UTMDACC on prospective clinical
trials in which all patients received anthracycline-based
chemotherapy. Despite uniform distribution of treatment, black patients were found to have poorer survival,
with no differences found between Hispanics and whites.
They suggested that maybe biologic differences play a
major role to the poor survival observed among black
patients with breast cancer. Contrary, Bradley et al,4 used
data from the Detroit SEER program linked to Medicaid
records to evaluate the association between race, breast
cancer outcomes, and socioeconomic factors. They found
that the association between race and outcomes lost statistical significance after controlling for Medicaid enrollment and poverty, suggesting that perhaps the differences
reported are not solely to be explained by biology. When
we examined the unadjusted 5-year RFS and 5-year OS
rates, we observed interesting differences in outcome
according to race, based on the tumor type; however,
there results need to be interpreted carefully as baseline
differences in known prognostic factors exist. Black
patients with hormone receptor-positive disease had worse
RFS and OS rates compared with whites, potentially
reflecting differences in further access to healthcare or coverage for medications prescribed in the adjuvant setting
(ie, tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) that may affect
compliance. Although less clear, another possible contributing factor is a different percentage of black patients
being poor CYP2D6 metabolizers.37,38 Despite our short
follow-up, similar results were very recently reported as
part of a large randomized study. Sparano et al39 analyzed
the effect of race and tumor subtype in outcome. They
included participants of clinical trial E1199 (n Â¼ 4950).

Patients were treated with adjuvant anthracycline- and
taxane-based chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of
95 months, and after adjusting for potential confounders,
the authors observed that black patients with hormone receptor-positive disease had worse disease-free survival and
OS compared with whites (HR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.362.44] and HR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.18-2.78], respectively).
Dawood et al,26 in a database analysis from our
institution, explored the effect of race in pCR among
patients with triple receptor-negative tumors. Three-year
RFS and 3-year OS rates were similar for the black group,
compared with white/other race groups. After controlling
for patient and tumor characteristics, race was not found
to be significantly associated with RFS (HR, 1.08; 95%
CI, 0.69-1.68) or OS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.69-1.68).
Also, similar to our own results, no significant differences
were observed when racial groups were divided according
to pCR. We believe this is a very important observation,
because it suggests that, among different races, pCR is an
important surrogate marker of improved long-term
outcome.
Contrary results have been reported by Balmanoukian et al.40 In a retrospective analysis of 38 patients with
triple receptor-negative tumors who were treated with
NST (33 of whom received anthracycline- and taxanebased NST), differences in outcome were observed
according to race. With a median follow-up of 2.1 years,
survival curves indicated shorter RFS and OS (P Â¼ .045
and .028, respectively) for African-American women
compared with white/other women. This difference in
results is likely related to small sample size, different
patient populations, and differences baseline characteristics potentially not accounted for in the multivariable
analysis. The report by Balmanoukian et al40 serves to
highlight the fact that results of single-institution retrospective studies need confirmation from larger multiinstitutional prospective studies.
To appreciate the findings of the current study,
some strengths and limitations need to be addressed. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study evaluating the effect of race/ethnicity in pCR in patients treated
with anthracycline- and taxane-based NST published to
date. Despite the retrospective nature of our analysis, the
database that we used was prospectively maintained. All
the patients were treated at UTMDACC, allowing us to
state with confidence that patients were treated with
standard chemotherapy in a similar way, irrespective of
their race, thereby reducing any potential bias derived
from differences in treatment. Race was self-reported, and

the only groups identified in our database were black,
white, Hispanic, and other; therefore, it is possible that
considerable heterogeneity exists within each group. It is
possible that some differences in outcome did not achieve
statistical significance when the analyses were made
according to race and breast cancer subtype because of the
small numbers of patients that achieved a pCR. In addition, this cohort of patients received homogeneous NST
and surgical treatments, although differences in follow-up
or compliance with subsequent therapy were not
addressed. The median follow-up on our study was 30
months. This is potentially a limited follow-up time for
the patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors. It is
possible that, with longer follow-up, some differences
become evident.
In conclusion, this study makes the important observation that, in this cohort of patients, race was not significantly associated with pCR rates in patients receiving
anthracycline- and taxane-based NST. On multivariate
analysis, we observed a trend toward worse outcomes in
black patients, and also improved 5-year RFS and OS in
Hispanics when compared with whites. Our observations
need to be confirmed in a larger prospective study. Several
questions remain unanswered regarding outcome differences among Hispanics and black patients, and further
epidemiologic and molecular characterization of the
tumors is needed to explore the potential differences in
biology and outcomes.
