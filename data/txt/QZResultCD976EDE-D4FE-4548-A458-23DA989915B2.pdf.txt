ABSTRACT
Mislocalization of proteins is a common feature of cancer cells. Since localization
of proteins is tightly linked to its function, cancer cells can inactivate function of a
tumor suppressor protein through mislocalization. The nuclear exportin CRM1/XPO 1
is upregulated in many cancers. Targeting XPO 1 can lead to nuclear retention of cargo
proteins such as p53, Foxo, and BRCA1 leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
We demonstrate that selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) can functionally
inactivate XPO 1 in prostate cancer cells. Unlike the potent, but toxic, XPO 1 inhibitor
leptomycin B, SINE inhibitors (KPT-185, KPT-330, and KPT-251) cause a decrease
in XPO 1 protein level through the proteasomal pathway. Treatment of prostate
cancer cells with SINE inhibitors lead to XPO 1 inhibition, as evaluated by RevGFP
export assay, leading to nuclear retention of p53 and Foxo proteins, consequently,
triggering apoptosis. Our data reveal that treatment with SINE inhibitors at nanomolar
concentrations results in decrease in proliferation and colonogenic capacity of prostate
cancer cells by triggering apoptosis without causing any cell cycle arrest. We further
demonstrate that SINE inhibitors can be combined with other chemotherapeutics
like doxorubicin to achieve enhanced growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells. Since
SINE inhibitors offer increased bioavailability, reduced toxicity to normal cells, and
are orally available they can serve as effective therapeutics against prostate cancer.
In conclusion, our data reveals that nucleocytoplasmic transport in prostate cancer
can be effectively targeted by SINE inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Generally, any molecule above 42kD, a size which
does not qualify for passive diffusion across the nuclear
membrane barrier, is actively transported through the
nuclear pore [3] . Import of protein inside the nucleus is
carried by importins while export of RNA and proteins
is carried by exportins [4]. Among the seven known
exportins present in the mammalian cell, Exportin 1 (XPO
1, also called CRM1) is the most studied prototype [5,
6]. XPO 1 binds to leucine rich nuclear export sequences
present in the cargo proteins to export them out of the

Protein localization is tightly linked to its function
[1, 2]. Improper localization of a nuclear protein to the
cytoplasm can render it functionally inactive. Hence,
spatial and temporal localization of protein molecules in
the cell is tightly regulated by transporters [1, 2]. In the
nucleus, protein transport is carried by a group of proteins
belonging to the karyopherin family of transporters.

nucleus [7]. However the affinity of XPO 1 alone to
nuclear export sequences is low which is exponentially
enhanced when bound to active RanGTPase [8, 9]. GTP
bound active Ran along with XPO 1 and the cargo protein
forms a ternary complex that is exported out of the nuclear
pore complex. Outside the nucleus, aided by cytoplasmic
RanGTPase activating protein, RanGTP undergoes
GTP hydrolysis causing XPO 1 to lose its affinity for
the nuclear export sequence and release the cargo in the
cytoplasm [6, 10]. Normal cells utilize nuclear transporters
to maintain cellular physiology and homeostasis, while
cancer cells dysregulate nuclear transporters to mislocalize
nuclear proteins to gain selective survival and growth
advantage [4]. Hence, modulation of nucleocytoplasmic
transport by small molecule modulators against cancer is
actively sought.
Increased expression of XPO 1 protein has been
noted in several cancer types including pancreatic [11],
cervical [12], ovarian [13], mantle cell lymphoma [14],
and glioma [15]. Cancer cells utilize XPO 1 to export,
among others, p53, APC, p21, p27, Foxo, BRCA1, ATM,
and TopoI to the cytoplasm [4, 5, 10, 16]. Restriction
of these key gatekeeper and caretaker proteins to the
cytoplasmic compartment prevents them from suppressing
tumor growth. Since half of the cancers retain a wild
type p53 gene, restoring nuclear p53 function through
inhibition of XPO 1 could trigger cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis [17, 18]. This makes XPO 1 an attractive target
in a variety of cancers. Leptomycin B, a known potent and
selective inhibitor of XPO 1, covalently binds to the Cys528
residue in the nuclear export signal (NES)-binding groove
of XPO 1 and inactivates it [19]. Although potent, this
compound suffers from being very toxic to normal cells
resulting in a very narrow therapeutic window. Knowledge
about overt toxicity, gained from a Phase I clinical trial,
led to discontinuation of leptomycin B from further
clinical development [20]. This however did not deter
the search for novel compounds, with increased efficacy
and reduced toxicities that could target nucleocytoplasmic
transport. Selective inhibitors of nuclear transport (SINE)
are novel inhibitors of XPO 1 that differ structurally
from leptomycin B but like leptomycin B they covalently
bind to Cys528 residue in the central conserved region of
XPO 1 and inactivates it [14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In this
study, we investigated the effect of three SINE inhibitors
KPT185, KPT330, and KPT251 on prostate cancer. These
compounds selectively bind to XPO 1 and inhibit its
function at the nanomolar range. KPT301, the 10-fold less
active trans-isomer of KPT185, was included as a negative
control. Our data indicate that SINE inhibitors, unlike
leptomycin B, decrease XPO 1 protein level through
proteasomal degradation and selectively trigger apoptosis
and inhibit prostate cancer cells but not normal prostate
cells.

SINE inhibitors inhibit XPO 1 function in
prostate cancer cells
Increased expression of XPO 1 protein is found
in many cancer cell lines and tissues [11, 13, 14]. To
investigate the expression of XPO 1 in normal prostate
and prostate cancer cell lines, we conducted a western
blot analysis on lysates of normal prostate epithelial cells
(PrEC), prostate fibroblast, and androgen responsive
(LNCaP) and non-responsive (DU-145 and PC3)
prostate cancer cells. Western blots indicate that XPO
1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells as compared
to normal prostate epithelial cells or prostate fibroblasts
(Fig. 1A).To investigate whether prostate cancer cell lines
harbored a functional XPO 1 protein, we utilized a green
fluorescent Rev protein which localizes to the nucleus
and the nucleolus. Export of Rev out of the nucleus into
the cytoplasm is dependent on XPO 1 [25]. Transfection
of prostate cancer cell lines with the RevGFP construct
revealed the presence of GFP fluorescence in all the three
cellular compartments,indicating a functional XPO 1 in
prostate cancer cell lines (data not shown). To investigate
whether leptomycin B is able to functionally inactivate
XPO 1 in prostate cancer cells, we treated RevGFP
transfected LNCaP cells with leptomycin B. This led to
nuclear and nucleolar retention of RevGFP, indicating
leptomycin B is able to functionally inactivate XPO 1 in
LNCaP cells (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of XPO 1 with XPO 1
specific inhibitor, leptomycin B, in DU-145 and LNCaP
cells demonstrated that leptomycin B treatment does not
lead to a decrease in XPO 1 protein levels, inferring that
XPO 1 is functionally inactivated by leptomycin B without
a loss of protein expression (Fig. 1C). These data indicate
that XPO 1 is functionally active in prostate cancer cells
and can be specifically inhibited by leptomycin B. We
next used SINE inhibitors (Fig. 2A) in prostate cancer
cells and tested their ability to functionally inactivate
XPO 1. Treatment of RevGFP transfected LNCaP cells
with 1µM of SINE inhibitors led to nuclear and nucleolar
retention of RevGFP indicating that SINE inhibitors
can functionally inhibit XPO 1 in prostate cancer cells.
RevGFP localization in cells treated with the trans-isomer
(KPT301) was found similar to that of controls (Fig.
2B and supplementary Fig. S1). This suggested that,
like leptomycin B, KPT185,-330, and -251 are potent
inhibitors of XPO 1 function.

function of XPO 1 [14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In this respect,
the mode of action of the SINE inhibitors is similar to
leptomycin B. However, when we treated prostate
cancer cell lines with increasing concentration of SINE
inhibitors we found that all the three inhibitors, except
KPT301, decreased XPO 1 protein at lower nanomolar
concentrations (Fig. 3A). LNCaP cells were most sensitive
to XPO 1 downregulation followed by PC3 and DU-145

cells. Most strikingly, KPT301 which is 10 fold less potent
exhibited a decrease in XPO 1 protein at concentrations 10
fold greater than other SINE inhibitors. In order to dismiss
that this was not due to a general decrease in all exportins,
we probed the lysates for a related exportin, namely
exportin5. Treatment with increasing concentration of
SINE inhibitors did not decrease exportin 5 protein
levels indicating that downregulation was highly specific

to XPO 1 (Fig. 3B). Downregulation of XPO 1 could
be either due to transcriptional or post transcriptional
regulation. We chose to test the likelihood that XPO 1
is post translationally decreased by SINE inhibitors. We
argued that although SINE inhibitors bind to the same
residue in XPO 1 as leptomycin B, it is likely that SINE
inhibitors change the conformation of XPO 1 such that it
is recognized by the proteasomal degradation machinery
and thereby degraded. To investigate this possibility, we
treated LNCaP cells with 1µM of KPT185 and its transisomer KPT301, as a single agent, and in combination with
the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. While KPT185 as a
single agent decreased XPO 1 protein levels, combination
of KPT185 with MG-132 led to stabilization of XPO 1
protein indicating that decreased protein level seen after
treatment with SINE inhibitors was a result of proteasomal
mediated degradation (Fig. 3C).

which in turn labels the transcription factor Foxo
with an inactivating phosphorylation mark [27, 28].
Phosphorylated Foxo is exported out of the nucleus in a
XPO 1 dependent manner and is prevented from turning
on cell cycle arrest genes [29]. Further since p53 is
mutated in 50% of prostate cancers, stabilization of p53
could lead to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in prostate
cancer that harbor wild type p53 gene [30, 31]. Since p53
is degraded in the cytoplasm through MDM2-mediated
ubiqitination, preventing nuclear export of p53 could lead
to its stabilization [32]. To investigate whether treatment
with SINE inhibitors lead to nuclear retention and
accumulation of p53 and Foxo proteins in prostate cancer
cells, we treated LNCaP cells with KPT185 and studied
protein localization by confocal immunofluorescence
microscopy. We chose LNCaP cells as they harbor
deletion of one PTEN allele and a mutation in the other
allele and also retain a wild type p53 gene [33]. While
untreated cells exhibited Foxo staining primarily in the
cytoplasm, KPT185 treated cells demonstrated primarily
nuclear Foxo proteins, indicating Foxo is retained in the
nucleus after treatment (Fig. 4A). A similar observation
was noted for p53. In control cells, p53 was faintly
visible in the nucleus, this is due to the fact that p53 is
continuously exported out and degraded in the cytoplasm
[32]. However, treatment with KPT185 increased p53
nuclear retention and stabilized p53 (Fig. 4B). Nuclear
retention of FOXO proteins and stabilization of p53 could
trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. To evaluate whether

Inhibition of XPO 1 by SINE inhibitors leads to
retention of tumor suppressors Foxo and p53 in
the nucleus
Mislocalization of nuclear tumor suppressor protein
precludes it from executing its tumor suppressor function
thereby leading to an increase in tumor aggressiveness
and progression. Pertaining to prostate cancer, recurring
inactivation of PTEN due to mutation or deletion is a
common recurrence in prostate cancer [26]. Inactivation
of PTEN leads to an increase in Akt kinase activity

SINE inhibitors could cause either response, we first
evaluated their effect on cell cycle of prostate cancer cell
lines. As shown in Fig. 4C, in our experimental conditions,
we did not find any significant cell cycle changes after
treatment with KPT185; however, we did find an increase
in sub-G1 populations, indicative of apoptotic cells, with
an increase in inhibitor concentration. KPT301 did not
have much effect even when treated at 1µM. LNCaP cells
which harbor a wild type p53 showed a greater increase
in sub-G1 population as compared to PC3 and DU-145
cells. This data suggest that SINE compounds may trigger
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells without causing any cell
cycle arrest.

levels of p53, increasing doses of KPT185, -330 and -251
stabilizes p53 levels in LNCaP cells. Thus SINE inhibitors
can lead to nuclear retention and stabilization of key tumor
suppressors in prostate cancer cells. To evaluate apoptosis,
we probed for γ-H2AX and phosphorylated ATM as
surrogate markers of apoptosis [34]. As seen in Figure 5A
treatment with SINE inhibitors in LNCaP cells results in
stabilization of p53 protein with a concomitant increase in
γ-H2AX, indicative of double strand DNA breaks resulting
from apoptotic DNA fragments [34].This data was
supported by a similar increase in phosphorylated ATM
in both LNCaP and DU-145 cells (Fig. 5B). We further
probed the lysates for cleaved PARP, a classical marker
for apoptosis. PARP was cleaved as early as 12h after
treatment in LNCaP cells (Fig. 5C), perhaps indicating
that LNCaP cells are slightly more sensitive to SINE
inhibitors than DU-145 and PC3 cells. Nonetheless, all
the prostate cancer cell lines exhibited a dose dependent
increase in cleaved PARP upon treatment (Fig. 6A). We
quantified apoptosis in LNCaP cells using flow cytometry.
LNCaP cells were treated with KPT185 (100nM) and
KPT301 (1µM) for 24h and stained for Annexin V. As
shown in Figure 6B, KPT185 induced early and late

We next evaluated whether SINE inhibitors can
indeed trigger apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. We
first confirmed that p53 is indeed stabilized after treatment
with SINE inhibitors by probing inhibitor treated LNCaP

control lysates and KPT301 do not stabilize appreciable

apoptosis in significant population of cells as compared to
trans-isomer KPT301.To determine whether apoptosis is
not due to general toxicity, we treated prostate fibroblasts
with SINE inhibitors at various concentrations (1µM and
5µM). These concentrations are five-fold higher than
the concentrations needed to trigger PARP cleavage in
prostate cancer cell lines. As seen in Figure 6C, treatment
with SINE inhibitors did not trigger PARP cleavage in
prostate fibroblast, indicating that SINE inhibitors cause
selective death of prostate cancer cells. This data indicates
that prostate cancer cells are sensitive to XPO 1 inhibition
and respond to inhibition by apoptosis.

assessed using a soluble MTS assay. As shown in Figure
7A, SINE inhibitors caused a dose dependent decrease
in proliferation of all the prostate cancer lines. LNCaP
cells were found to be most affected by XPO 1 inhibition
as compared to the other two prostate cancer cell lines.
Corroborating our data on PARP cleavage, proliferation
of prostate fibroblasts was unaffected upon treatment
by SINE inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We also
tested whether normal immortalized 957E/hTERT prostate
epithelial cells were inhibited by SINE inhibitors. We
found that only higher micormolar amounts of SINE
inhibitors affected proliferation of 957E/hTERT prostate
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Since MTS assay is a
short term assay for proliferation and does not effectively
convey cell survival, we performed a cell survival
clonogenic assay to evaluate the long term effect of XPO
1 inhibition. All the prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated
a decrease in clonogenic capacity after treatment, LNCaP
being the most sensitive of the three (Fig. 7B and
Supplementary figure S3). This data clearly demonstrates

that XPO 1 inhibition affects growth and survival of
prostate cancer cells and that XPO 1 is a druggable target
for prostate cancer treatment. Whether XPO 1 inhibition
can be combined with existing therapies/drugs to achieve
a greater decrease in cell growth was the next question
we tried to address. Prostate cancer cell lines DU-145
and PC3 were treated with a combination of doxorubicin
and KPT185 and subjected to clonogenic assays. While
single agents decreased clonogenic survival as expected,
combination of KPT185 with doxorubicin resulted in
enhanced decrease in clonogenic potential in both the cell
lines (Fig. 7C). This suggests that combination of SINE
inhibitors with existing therapies is a viable and perhaps
more effective option in decreasing prostate cancer
growth.

with minimal weight loss or other toxicities [24]. We
show that, similar to leptomycin B, SINE inhibitors can
functionally inactivate XPO 1. Although both leptomycin
B and SINE inhibitors bind covalently to Cys528 residue
of XPO 1 in the NES-binding groove, unlike leptomycin
B, SINE inhibitors can cause proteasomal degradation of
XPO 1. This may be due to differences in their binding
ability and occupancy of the NES groove as revealed by a
recent X-ray crystallographic analysis [36]. Interestingly,
the same study demonstrated that leptomycin B is totally
reversible while SINE is slowly reversible which can
explain, at least in part, why SINE inhibitors are better
tolerated. Such differences may also cause sustained
changes in the conformation of XPO 1 which could be
recognized as a signal for degradation by the proteasomal
degradation machinery.
Our data demonstrates that SINE inhibitors can
lead to retention of Foxo in the nucleus, contributing
to apoptosis. Additionally, our data indicates that p53
is stabilized through nuclear retention when prostate
cancer cells are treated with SINE inhibitors. This could
potentiate apoptosis in prostate cancer cells that have wild
type p53 and could be one of the reasons why LNCaP
cells that have wild type p53, as well as a hyperactive
PI3K/Akt pathway, show increased sensitivity to SINE
inhibitors as compared to DU-145 and PC3 cells.
However, the observation that DU-145 and PC3 cells
do succumb to SINE inhibitor treatment, albeit at higher
nanomolar concentration compared to LNCaP cells,
indicate that apoptosis is triggered in these prostate cancer
cells independent of p53. Given that XPO 1 can export
nearly 300 protein cargos involved in DNA repair, cell
cycle regulation, and cell proliferation, death in prostate
cancer cells may be triggered by a general breakdown
of the nuclear export machinery. In this case cells that
harbor a wild type p53 (such as LNCaP), may be poised
to efficiently trigger apoptosis which may explain the
increased sensitivity. Another interesting observation from
our results is the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to XPO
1 inhibition as compared to normal prostate fibroblast and
epithelial cells. It is likely that cancer cells rely heavily
on XPO 1 for nuclear export of deleterious nuclear tumor
suppressors that can otherwise cause cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. This could be a reason why many cancer cells
have an upregulation of XPO 1 protein. It is also likely
that the higher proliferation and metabolic demand of
cancer cells renders nuclear export obligatory for survival.
Our study provides the rationale for investigating SINE
inhibitors in preclinical animal models of prostate
cancer for subsequent clinical translation. In the past,
we and others have successfully combined various anticancerous agents and treatment modalities in pre-clinical
settings against prostate cancer for a better therapeutic
outcome [37, 38, 39]. Synergistic combinations offer
better therapeutic outcomes with the added advantage
of reduced toxicities against normal body cells. Our

DISCUSSION
Targeted therapy that relies on pathway profile of an
individual tumor is a step towards personalized medicine.
Tailoring therapy against proteins which are hyperactive
in tumors and essential for tumor survival can lead to
better therapy. XPO 1 transports nearly 300 different
cargo proteins across the nuclear envelope [4, 10, 35].
Several key pathways that fuel prostate cancer growth
and survival are regulated by proteins that are cargos of
XPO 1. For some of the cancer relevant cargos like p53,
XPO 1 is the sole exportin [4, 10]. Since nearly half of
the prostate cancers retain a wildtype p53 gene, restoring
nuclear p53 function through inhibition of XPO 1 could
trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This makes XPO 1
an attractive target for prostate cancer. Inhibiting prostate
cancer nuclear export, independent of androgen receptor
status, through agents that offer increased efficacy and
reduced toxicity may benefit a bigger cohort of prostate
cancer patients including castration resistant patients.
Although leptomycin B is a potent and selective inhibitor
of XPO 1, it suffered from being very toxic to normal
cells resulting in a very narrow therapeutic window and
was discontinued from further clinical development [20].
However, leptomycin B provided the prospect that XPO
1, and various cancer relevant pathways that it impacts,
can be druggable. This provided the rationale and impetus
for developing novel SINE compounds with reduced
toxicities that potently inhibit XPO 1. Our data indicates
that SINE inhibitors are effective in inhibiting XPO 1
in prostate cancer cells and may offer reduced toxicities
over leptomycin B. SINE inhibitors differ structurally
from leptomycin B, but like leptomycin B they covalently
bind and occupy the NES-binding region of XPO 1 and
inactivate it [14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24]. These inhibitors
offer increased bioavailability, reduced toxicity to normal
cells, and are water soluble making them orally available
[14, 22, 23]. SINE compounds have been experimentally
shown to increase overall survival in the Eμ-TCL1SCID mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia

doxorubicin to achieve enhanced decrease in clonogenic
potential of prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, our study
identifies XPO 1 as a novel target in prostate cancer and
demonstrates that SINE inhibitors can act as potent anticancerous agents.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

for housekeeping proteins such as vinculin and actin,
used as internal controls, were diluted at 1:4000. Blots
were developed using ECL (GE Healthcare) or Femto
(Pierce Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were
purchased from the following source; XPO 1 (Santacruz),
p53 (Calbiochem), cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling
Technologies), phospho ATM (Rockland), Exportin5
(Epitomics), phospho H2AX (Millipore).

Cell lines

Induction of apoptosis and determination of cell
survival by flow cytometric assay
Cells were plated in 60mm dishes and treated with
SINE inhibitors at a confluency of 50-70%. After 48h,
both floating and attached cells were collected, washed in
PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in a fixative solution
containing 10% neutral buffered saline (NBF). Cells were
permeabilized in 90% methanol and stained with antibody
against annexin V (Cell Signaling Technologies). Nuclei
were stained with propidium iodide in PBS containing
10% FBS. Flow cytometry was performed on the FACS
Calibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and data
were analyzed using FlowJo software.

Prostate cancer cell lines (DU-145, PC3, and
LNCaP) were obtained from ATCC, normal prostate
epithelial cells (PrEC) were obtained from Lonza, HPV
immortalized normal prostate epithelial RWPE cells were
obtained from ATCC, and hTERT immortalized normal
prostate epithelial cells (957E/hTERT) were a kind gift
from Dr. John Isaacs. Human prostate fibroblasts, kindly
provided by Dr. John Isaacs, were obtained from a prostate
biopsy on a 62-year old patient with prostate cancer having
a Gleason score of 4. All cancer cell lines and prostate
fibroblast were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Corning) media
supplemented with 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products),
PrEC and 957E/hTERT cells were grown in keratinocyte
serum free media (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in a
humidified incubator at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Confocal and Fluorescence microscopy
Cells were plated and treated with the inhibitors
at a confluency 50-70%. For the RevGFP localization
experiment, cells were plated in 60mm dishes and allowed
to reach a confluency of 90% before being transfected
with the RevGFP construct with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Cells were followed and imaged at the
end of 2h. Multiple fields per slide were photographed
with a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti inverted research microscope
(Nikon Instruments, Linthicum, MD, USA). For nuclear
localization of p53 and FOXO protein, LNCaP cells were
treated at 50-70% confluency. 48h post-treatment, cells
were fixed in formalin and permeabilized with 0.125%
Triton X 100 for 20 min at 37°C. The permeabilized cells
were incubated with 5% BSA in PBS for 2h followed by
overnight incubation with primary antibodies for either
p53 or FOXO (Cell Signaling Technologies). Cells were
washed three times with 5% BSA in PBS and probed with
Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen).
Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4’,6-diamidino2-phenylindole) (Sigma Aldrich) and cells were mounted
on slides. Confocal z-stack images were imaged using a
Zeiss LSM 510 meta-confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Thornwood, NY, USA).

Inhibitors and reagents
SINE inhibitors (KPT185, KPT301, KPT330 and
KPT251) were provided by Karyopharm Therapeutics
(Natick, MA). Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO at
a stock concentration of 10mM and diluted in RPMI
1640 medium at the required concentration just before
treatment. Leptomycin B, MG-132 and crystal violet
solution were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). CellTiter 96™ AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell
Proliferation Assay reagent was purchased from Promega
(Madison, WI). RevGFP construct was kindly provided by
Dr. George N. Pavlakis (NCI).

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were performed as follows.
Cells were plated in 100mm dishes and treated at a
confluency of 50-70%. SINE inhibitors and leptomycin
B were used at the specified concentrations. Treatments
were carried out for 12, 24, and 48h, as specified. Post
treatment, total protein was isolated and ten micrograms
were used for electrophoresis and blotted on PVDF
membrane. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking
buffer (either 5% milk or 5% BSA as per antibody
specifications) to a 1:1000 dilution. Secondary antibodies

72h post inhibitor treatment, cell viability was measured
using the CellTiter 96™ AQueous Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorption
at 490nm was determined using a microplate reader
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Cells were plated in 60mm dishes and treated
with the inhibitors at 50-60% confluency. After 48h of
treatment with inhibitors, 1x103 (DU-145/PC3) or 2x103
cells (LNCaP) from each treated or control dish were
plated in triplicate in 60mm dishes and incubated for 12
days. Colonies were stained with a crystal violet solution
(Sigma Aldrich) and counted manually. Comparisons were
performed using student’s t-test.
