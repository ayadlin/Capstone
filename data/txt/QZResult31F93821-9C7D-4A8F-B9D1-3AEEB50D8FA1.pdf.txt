Abstract
Abiraterone acetate is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CYP17, an enzyme that
catalyzes two key serial reactions (17 alpha hydroxylase and
17,20 lyase) in androgen and estrogen biosynthesis. Clinical
trials have confirmed that specific inhibition of CYP17 is safe
and results in clinically important antitumor activity in up to
70% of castrate patients with advanced prostate cancer
resistant to currently available endocrine therapies. These
clinical data indicate that castration-resistant prostate cancer
frequently remains hormone dependent and has confirmed
that this disease should no longer be described as ‘‘hormone
resistant or refractory’’. Biomarker studies, including the
analysis of ETS gene fusion status, on patients treated with
abiraterone acetate may allow enrichment of patients with a
sensitive phenotype in future studies of therapeutics targeting
CYP17. [Cancer Res 2009;69(12):4937–40]

result in up to 30% of patients stopping treatment due to toxicity (2).
Moreover, resistance to ketoconazole can develop secondary to loss
of CYP17 inhibition (2). Similarly, currently available antiandrogens,
such as bicalutamide, that are used prior to ketoconazole are weak
and reversible antagonists of the AR and in up to 30% of cases become
AR agonists (2). Clinical benefits induced by other hormonal
manipulations, for example with the estrogenic compound diethylstilboestrol (DES) or steroids, are also short-lived (5). In fact, this
disease state was until recently referred to as ‘‘hormone-refractory’’ or
‘‘androgen-independent,’’ which however, is more a reflection of the
ineffective pharmacological properties of currently available therapies than an accurate representation of the disease biology. Novel
drugs targeting AR signaling such as the potent and specific inhibitor
of CYP17, abiraterone acetate, and novel antiandrogens such as
MDV-3100 have confirmed the presence of a hormone-dependent
castration-resistant prostrate cancer (CRPC) phenotype.

Inhibition of CYP17 with Abiraterone Acetate
Introduction
Prostate cancer that is resistant to all currently available
endocrine therapies may remain driven by ligand-dependent or
ligand-independent activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling.
AR, and other nuclear steroid receptors including ERa, have been
implicated in impacting the expression of the ETS oncogenes that
could be critical to prostate carcinogenesis. Although chemical or
surgical castration, which can reduce serum testosterone levels to
<50 ng/dL, has remained the most effective treatment for this
disease for more than 60 years, recent studies indicate that prostate
cancers may generate intracrine androgenic steroids or become
‘‘hypersensitive’’ to low steroid levels through AR gene mutations or
amplification supporting continued tumor growth (1, 2).
Androgenic steroids are the most potent known AR agonists
(Fig. 1A), and high intratumoral levels of these hormones can be
maintained in the castrate state either by the intratumoral
conversion of serum adrenal androstenedione to testosterone
(secondary to overexpression of aldo-keto reductase family 1,
member C3) (ref. 3) or by the de novo intratumoral synthesis of
androgens from substrates such as cholesterol or progesterone (4).
Steroid hormone synthesis is dependent on CYP17, a key enzyme in
the generation of both androgens and estrogens (Fig. 1A). Inhibition
of CYP17 can be induced by the nonspecific, weak, inhibitor of several
CYP enzymes, ketoconazole (2). However, owing to low specificity
for CYP17, the doses required for CYP17 blockade are several-fold
higher than utilized for antifungal treatment, are hepatotoxic, and

Chemists at our institution utilized testicular extracts and
radiolabeled CYP17 steroid substrates, with the detection of CYP17
steroid products by high-performance liquid chromatography, to
screen for small molecule chemical inhibitors of this enzyme (6).
These studies led to the identification of a potent, selective, and
irreversible inhibitor of CYP17, abiraterone. Preclinical studies
indicated that this agent substantially decreased androgenic
steroids downstream of CYP17 resulting in decreased ventral
prostate, testicular, and seminal vesicle weights (7). The acetate
form of this compound was recommended for oral dosing owing to
improved bioavailability. On the basis of studies of the rare
syndrome of congenital CYP17 deficiency, patients treated with
abiraterone acetate were predicted to develop a syndrome of
mineralocorticoid excess but not adrenocortical insufficiency (8).
The recently published 21-patient phase I study of once-daily
continuous abiraterone acetate confirmed that specific inhibition
of CYP17 was safe. Because abiraterone suppressed both 17-alphahydroxylase and C-17,20-lyase CYP17 activity (Fig. 1A), its
continuous administration resulted in an increase in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) levels that increased C-17 steroids
upstream of CYP17 including corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone. These steroids maintained glucocorticoid activity but also
caused a syndrome of mineralocorticoid excess, characterized by
hypokalemia, fluid retention, and hypertension. This was reversible
either with the mineralocorticoid antagonist eplerenone (spironolactone was contraindicated as it can activate AR, see ref. 9) or
with daily low dose steroids that suppress ACTH. Importantly,
abiraterone suppressed downstream C-21 androgenic steroids to
below the lower limit of detection of conventional assays, although
cross-reaction of abiraterone with the dehyroepiandrostenedione
(DHEA) assay resulted in a false reading of incompletely suppressed
DHEA (10). Downstream metabolites of these steroids, including
testosterone and estradiol were suppressed to undetectable levels.

Figure 1. A, Abiraterone acetate inhibits CYP17-dependent synthesis of DHEA resulting in suppression of circulating adrenal androgens, testosterone, and estrogens
and of de novo tumor androgen synthesis. Reduced levels of AR ligands result in reduced transcription of AR-regulated genes, including PSA and ERG , and
tumor regression. B, 30% of patients do not have any response to abiraterone acetate and virtually all patients will ultimately progress on treatment. Proposed
mechanisms of resistance include either activation of a promiscuous AR by alternative ligands, such as deoxycorticosterone or ligand-independent AR activation
due to cross-talk with activated receptor tyrosine kinases, or activation of cell signaling pathways (e.g. the PI3K/AKT pathway in association with PTEN loss), or
following AR amplification or mutations. Also, transcription of genes such as TMPRSS2 could be activated by other steroid receptors, for example the estrogen receptor
(ERa) or progesterone receptor (PR).

Because previous studies had shown that concomitant castration
prevents a compensatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that can
overcome testicular CYP17 inhibition by abiraterone, these patients
treated on abiraterone acetate were maintained on luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs on which they had
previously had progressive prostate cancer (11).
Continuous administration of abiraterone acetate resulted in
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines, radiological tumor regression, falls in circulating tumor cell (CTC) count, normalization of
lactate dehydrogenase, and symptom improvement in up to 70% of
CRPC patients who had previously received multiple hormonal
treatments (median: three lines) and investigational therapies (10).
Five doses from 250 mg to 2,000 mg daily were investigated, treating
three patients in each dose cohort. Although the study was not
designed to compare the antitumor activity of different doses, clinical
responses were reported at every dose level and no dose-limiting
toxicities were observed. One thousand milligrams was recommended for phase II evaluation on the basis of a plateau in the increase of
upstream steroids at doses above 750 mg daily. Treatment with 1,000
mg of abiraterone acetate of a further 33 chemotherapy-naı̈ve
patients at our institution and a similar number of chemotherapy-

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (12). June 15, 2009

naı̈ve patients in at the University of California, San Francisco (CA),
have confirmed the antitumor activity reported in this first study.
Similarly, three separate multicenter studies have reported similar
evidence of antitumor activity in 40% to 60% of patients with endstage CRPC who had previously progressed on docetaxel and often,
multiple prior hormone therapies, second line chemotherapy, and
various experimental agents. These studies have been presented at
scientific meetings but are currently not yet published.
These results have led to the commencement in 2008 of a 1,180patient multicenter, double-blinded phase III study of abiraterone
acetate plus prednisolone/prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone/prednisolone in a 2:1 randomization. The primary endpoint of
this study is overall survival and will incorporate the prospective
evaluation of whether CTC counts post-treatment can serve as a
robust intermediate endpoint for overall survival in order to
accelerate new drug approval for CRPC. Evaluation of abiraterone
acetate in chemotherapy-naı̈ve patients in the metastatic, adjuvant,
and neoadjuvant settings is also warranted due to the high level of
activity observed and the low incidence of side effects. Importantly,
in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, treatment with
abiraterone acetate could improve cure rates.

Abiraterone Acetate in CRPC

Biomarkers to Identify Hormone-Dependent
Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Fusion of an ETS gene with a hormone-dependent promoter gene
occurs in up to 70% of therapy-naı̈ve prostate cancers (12). If the
majority of cancers lacking an ETS gene fusion were dependent on a
mechanism that is not hormone driven, then the presence of an ETS
gene fusion could identify cancers that are hormone dependent. The
most robust method for identifying ETS gene rearrangements in
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded or fresh-frozen tissue or in CTC is
by fluorescence in situ hybridization investigating rearrangements
at the ERG, ETV1, ETV4, or ETV5 gene loci (13). Fusion of TMPRSS2
with ERG accounts for the majority of ETS gene fusions. Evaluation
of ERG gene status in 77 patients treated on abiraterone acetate
phase I/II clinical trials reported that 12/15 patients who had a
z90% PSA decline had an ERG gene rearrangement (14). These data
suggest that cancers with a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion represent a
subpopulation enriched for hormone-dependent CRPC but do not
account for all clinical responses to abiraterone acetate. Moreover, as
yet unexplained mechanisms of primary resistance exist that can
result in failure of patients with a hormone-dependent fusion
positive cancer to respond to abiraterone acetate (12/77 patients
with a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion did not have a z50% PSA decline after
commencing abiraterone acetate). Pretreatment serum androstenedione has been reported to be significantly associated with a
clinical response to ketoconazole (15), and preliminary data have
suggested that there is a similar trend for adrenal androgens in the
upper quartile to associate with response to abiraterone acetate.
However, these translational studies have utilized changes in PSA as
a predictor of clinical benefit. As PSA is an androgen-regulated gene,
these associations with PSA declines may not translate into
associations with an improvement in overall survival: this will
require further evaluation in larger, future studies.

Mechanisms of Resistance to Abiraterone Acetate
AR signaling is maintained in a proportion of patients after the
development of resistance to abiraterone acetate, as evidenced by
responses to subsequent hormone treatments. Nonandrogenic ligands
can activate an amplified AR or a promiscuous AR that has undergone
structural change following single base-pair mutations (Fig. 1B).
Single-agent abiraterone acetate results in high levels of upstream
steroids, such as deoxycorticosterone, that can activate the AR in the
LNCaP cell line (16). Suppression of upstream steroids by addition of
dexamethasone resulted in re-induction of sensitivity to abiraterone
acetate, including in patients who had previously progressed on the
same dose and schedule dexamethasone. These data suggest that
activation of the AR by nonandrogenic ligands may occur in some
patients and could result in resistance to single-agent abiraterone
acetate (10). Future studies will combine abiraterone acetate with
steroids in order to prevent this.
Ligandless activation of AR signaling may occur secondary to AR
mutation or amplification that results in constitutive activation
(Fig. 1B). More recently, AR variants have also been described in
CRPC patients that lack the ligand-binding domain. These

constitutively active variants can induce canonical androgenresponsive gene expression in the absence of androgens (17). Also,
cross-talk with related signaling pathways, such as the Epidermal
Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) family or the phosphoinositide-3
kinase pathways, could reactivate downstream targets of AR
signaling (Fig. 1B) (refs. 18, 19). Drugs targeting these pathways
would only prove effective when ligand-activation of AR signaling is
completely abrogated, potentially explaining the absence of clinical
responses in CRPC with agents targeting the EGFR family. Moreover,
the 5¶-end of ETS gene fusions can be activated by other steroid
receptors, such as the estrogen receptor (20) activation of which
could also become important in CRPC when AR signaling is
completely abrogated. Furthermore, abiraterone suppresses estrogen
synthesis and this may contribute to its antitumor activity (Fig. 1A).

Future Directions
These data suggest that complete suppression of ligand synthesis
could become the standard of care for CRPC patients. This may be
achieved by combining a CYP17 inhibitor with castration.
Furthermore, the promising results reported with abiraterone
acetate in CRPC have introduced the possibility of CYP17 proving
active in other hormone-driven cancers and abiraterone is now
undergoing evaluation in metastatic breast cancer. The current
phase III clinical study of abiraterone acetate in docetaxel-treated
patients will be followed by clinical studies in chemotherapy-naı̈ve
patients and in hormone-therapy naı̈ve disease. This strategy will
not, however, reverse constitutive activation of the AR or of
AR-independent activation of ETS gene fusions or other downstream targets. We envision the future use of combinations of
agents targeting multiple such signaling pathways, selected for
individual patients on the basis of prior molecular characterization
of their tumors which could utilize the molecular characterization
of CTC. Changes in CTC counts are also currently being evaluated
as a possible intermediate endpoint to accelerate prostate cancer
drug development because changes in PSA and currently available
radiological imaging are not considered acceptable endpoints for
regulatory approval. Also, a major challenge for all these studies is
the selection of biomarkers that predict clinical benefit.
