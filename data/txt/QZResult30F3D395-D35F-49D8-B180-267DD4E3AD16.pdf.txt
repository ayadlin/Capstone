Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) is the main therapeutic target for
treatment of metastatic prostate cancers (PCa). As recurrent
tumors restore AR activity independent of hormones, new
therapies that abolish AR activity have been sought to prevent
or delay the emergence of ablation-resistant disease. Here,
we report that a novel abietane diterpene, 6-hydroxy-5,6dehydrosugiol (HDHS), isolated from the stem bark of
Cryptomeria japonica, was a potent AR antagonist in PCa
cells. HDHS treatment of androgen-dependent LNCaP and
androgen-responsive 22Rv1 cells induced apoptosis as shown
by nucleosome release, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7,
and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase accompanied
with concomitant up-regulation of tumor suppressor p53.
HDHS also decreased the protein expression of cyclins (D1
and E), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6),
and retinoblastoma phosphorylation in PCa cells, which suggest cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Oral administration
of HDHS at 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg once daily for 24 days to 22Rv1
PCa xenografted mice suppressed tumor growth by 22% and
39%, respectively, in association with decreased proliferation
and increased apoptosis in tumor cells, which further correlated with increased levels of HDHS in plasma and tumors.
Overall, our data suggest that HDHS has potential for use in
chemoprevention and chemotherapy of PCa. [Cancer Res 2008;
68(16):6634–42]

Introduction
Carcinoma of the prostate gland is the most common
malignancy in males in the Western world (1) and is also one of
the top 10 fatal cancers in Taiwan. Although the great majority of
prostate cancers (PCa) initially respond to androgen ablation,
recurrent tumors arise that become resistant, and at the terminal
stage, patients succumb to widespread metastases (2, 3). Androgens execute their functions through binding to the androgen
receptor (AR) that then regulates gene transcription in the cell
nucleus. Androgen-AR activity is tightly associated with the growth,
differentiation, and even carcinogenesis of the prostate (4, 5). In
fact, expression of AR protein is detected in nearly all PCa,
including those of distant metastases and ablation-resistant cases

(6). AR also up-regulates the gene transcription of prostate-specific
antigen (PSA), which is the most widely used serologic biomarker
of PCa for both diagnosis and therapeutic assessment (7, 8).
Previously, we exploited the PSA promoter, stably integrated in the
chromatin of PCa 22Rv1 cells, as a target and searched for signaling
inhibitors against PCa (9, 10).
Deregulation of the cell cycle contributes to the unrestrained
proliferation in human cancer (11). Anticancer agents often
modulate signal transduction pathways that regulate the cell cycle
and result in cytostatic and even apoptotic effects. The eukaryotic
cell cycle is controlled by interconnected biochemical events that
coordinate the transition of cells from one phase to another (12). A
series of molecular events in the G1 phase must complete before
the launch of chromosome replication in the S phase. During G1
progression, cyclin D complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDK), CDK4 and CDK6, to engender an active kinase complex that
phosphorylates a variety of cellular substrates, the most well
characterized being the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (Rb),
which is the gatekeeper for entry into the S phase (12, 13). Cyclin E
forms a complex with CDK2 to further phosphorylate Rb with the
release of general transcription factor E2F-1, which then stimulates
the transcription of genes involved in DNA replication (13, 14). In
addition to Rb, another important tumor suppressor required
for maintenance of the G1 checkpoint controls of the cell cycle is
p53, a transcription factor whose half-life increases on activation
(12, 13, 15). During apoptosis, a cascade of different caspases is
cleaved and activated for the cleavage of critical cellular substrates,
including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), whose cleavage
activates the DNA repair enzyme (16, 17). Therefore, ideal
chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic approaches often influence
expression of the regulatory molecules of cell cycle progression and
apoptosis.
Plant species contain scores of secondary metabolites. Research
interest in the specific bioactivity and potential applications of
plant compounds is increasing rapidly. Recently, we isolated some
abietane diterpenes that suppress AR activity in PCa cells by novel
mechanisms from Cryptomeria japonica D. Don (Taxodiaceae), also
called Sugi or Japanese cedar (10). 6-Hydroxy-5,6-dehydrosugiol
(HDHS) in particular (Fig. 1A, inset) exerted strong AR inhibitory
activity and decreased cell growth in a cell type–specific manner.
This study was designed to study the molecular mechanisms
whereby HDHS negatively affected AR function as well as growth of
human PCa in vitro and in vivo. HDHS inhibited AR through the
ligand-binding domain (LBD) and induced AR nuclear localization.
HDHS suppressed PCa growth by inducing apoptosis and blocked
cell cycle progression during the G1 phase of AR-dependent cells.
Moreover, orally administered HDHS retarded CWR22Rv1 tumor
growth in athymic nude mice without obvious toxic side effects
and reduced proliferation and promoted apoptosis dose dependently in the tumors.

described (9, 10). LNCaP, 22Rv1, and 103E cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone).
PC-3 and NIH-3T3 were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone) supplemented with
10% FBS. Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37jC in
5% CO2/air.
Cell viability and colony formation analyses. Equivalent 1  104 cells
of PCa or NIH-3T3 lines were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates with
10% FBS culture medium. After 24 h, cells were incubated in 10% FBS
medium containing different concentrations of HDHS or equivalent
amounts of vehicle alone as control for 48 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed with
AlamarBlue (Serotec). Colony-forming cell growth was analyzed as
described previously (9).
Transient transfection and luciferase assays. In one-hybrid assay,
22Rv1 cells (8  104 per well in 48-well plates) were cotransfected for
24 h with plasmids including pG5E1b-Luc (200 ng), pRL-CMV (50 ng), and
pCMX-GBD-AR(DE) (175 ng) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent
(Invitrogen). In mammalian two-hybrid assay, PC-3 cells (1.5  104 per well
in 48-well plates) were cotransfected with plasmids including pG5E1b-Luc
(200 ng), pRL-CMV (50 ng), pCMX-GBD-AR(DE) (175 ng), and pCMVVP16AR(38-918) (75 ng). The transfected cells were treated with vehicle or
various compound treatments for another 20 h. Luciferase activity was
measured using luciferase reporter gene assay system (Promega) and
normalized against respective Renilla luciferase values (18).
Immunofluorescence. LNCaP cells were grown in medium containing
5% charcoal-dextran–stripped FBS on 12-mm coverslips for 48 h and then
treated with vehicle or various compound treatments for another 1 h.
Cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 min,
permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100/PBS, and then washed with
PBS thrice. After blocking in 1% (v/v) fish gelatin/PBST (PBS with 0.1%
Tween 20) for 1 h, samples were incubated with AR (C-19, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) antibody at 4jC for 18 h, washed thrice with PBST, and
then probed with the respective fluorescence-conjugated secondary
antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The
samples were washed again and mounted in mounting medium (Vector).
The cellular location of AR was visualized by confocal microscopy (LSM
510 Meta, Carl Zeiss GmbH) and analyzed using the manufacturer’s
software.
Cell cycle analysis. The cell cycle of treated cells was examined by flow
cytometry after cellular staining with propidium iodide. Cells (5  105) were
seeded into six-well multidishes with 10% FBS culture medium for 48 h.
Cells were treated with HDHS, Casodex, or vehicle for 48 h. Cells were
trypsinized thereafter, washed twice with cold PBS, and centrifuged. The
pellet was suspended in cold PBS and 1 mL of 70% ethanol at 4jC overnight,
washed twice with cold PBS, and digested with RNase (100 Ag/mL final
concentration) and stained with propidium iodide (10 Ag/mL final
concentration) for 30 min and analyzed by flow cytometer (EPICS
XL-MCL, Beckman Coulter, Inc.).
In vivo studies. Athymic (nu/nu) nude mice (6–7 wk of age) were
obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center and housed in the
Laboratory Animal Center of the National Defense Medical Center (Taipei,
Taiwan) under conditions of constant photoperiod (12-h light/12-h dark)
and fed with Laboratory Autoclavable Rodent Diet 5010 (LabDiet). All
animal work was done in accordance with the protocol approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Academia Sinica. Aliquots
of 1  106 22Rv1 cells were suspended in 1:1 PBS mixed with Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) and were s.c. inoculated into the right flank of each mouse.
After 1 wk, mice were stochastically assigned to three groups (n = 7) that
received vehicle control or HDHS at different dosages (0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg/d),
by gavage in 0.2 mL of PBS containing 10% DMSO. Tumors were measured
twice weekly using calipers and their volumes were calculated using a
standard formula as follows: width2  length  0.5. Body weight was
measured weekly. Mice received 24 doses, and 24 h after the last dose, they
were sacrificed to harvest plasma and tumors. A portion of each tumor was
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC until needed for
Western blot analysis of relevant biomarkers, and the remainder was fixed
in 10% formalin overnight.

Immunohistochemistry. The paraffin-embedded tumor sections (4 Am
thickness) were heat immobilized and deparaffinized using xylene and
rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol with a final wash in distilled water.
Antigen retrieval was done in Target Retrieval Solution (DakoCytomation)
in a Decloaking Chamber (Biocare Medical) followed by quenching of
endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were then incubated with specific
primary antibodies, including mouse monoclonal anti-Ki-67 (DakoCytomation) and rabbit polyclonal anti-AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4jC
overnight in a humidity chamber. An EnVision system (DakoCytomation)
was used to detect the reaction products. In situ detection of apoptotic cells
was carried out using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL assay) reaction mixture according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Chemicon).
Data analysis. Data are presented as the mean F SD for the indicated
number of separate experiments. The statistical significance of differences
between two groups of data (Figs. 2A and B, 3A, and 5A, B, and D;
Supplementary Fig. S1B and D; Table 1) was analyzed by paired t test and
P values of <0.05 were considered significant. Dose-response curves and
IC50 for PSA inhibition (Fig. 1A) and relative colony growth (Fig. 2B) were
analyzed using a sigmoidal dose-response equation (variable slope) in Prism
3.02 (GraphPad) as described previously (9, 10).

Results
HDHS suppresses androgen-induced PSA expression. In
androgen-responsive 22Rv1 cells, HDHS decreased the androgenAR–mediated activation of PSA promoter luciferase reporter in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). By comparing with bicalutamide, a clinically used antiandrogen, brand name Casodex, HDHS
was as potent as Casodex and achieved a complete inhibition of
PSA promoter activity at concentration >10 Amol/L (Fig. 1A).
However, the slope of the HDHS dose-response curve was steeper
than that of Casodex, in which IC50 values of HDHS and Casodex
are 4.8 and 2.5 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 1A).
The AR suppression activity of HDHS was also examined in
LNCaP cells, another androgen-dependent PCa cell line. Expression
of endogenous PSA in treated cells as a measure of androgen
response and AR activity was detected by Western blot. As shown,
the intracellular expression of PSA and AR in LNCaP cells was
greatly induced by DHT treatment (Fig. 1B, lane 1 versus 2). The AR
activation of PSA expression by DHT diminished in the presence of
HDHS in a concentration-dependent manner and was completely
abolished by 10 Amol/L HDHS (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6). The protein
levels of AR in LNCaP cells were not significantly altered in cells
treated with 2.5 or 5 Amol/L of HDHS but fell to basal level in cells
treated with 10 Amol/L HDHS (Fig. 1B, lane 6 versus 2).
HDHS acts on LBD and induces AR nuclear localization. The
molecular mechanism whereby HDHS represses AR activity was
analyzed by the following experiments. First, a one-hybrid assay
has been used to detect hormonal effects on nuclear receptors (18).
Because the LBD of AR contains the AF-2 whose activation on
transcription relies on binding with agonist, we transfected the ARLBD fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GBD-AR-LBD) in
22Rv1 cells so that DHT binding to the AR-LBD can activate
transcription from GAL4-response element (Fig. 1C, left, lane 1).
Casodex competition with DHT for binding to the AR-LBD
inhibited the DHT induction of AR-LBD (Fig. 1C, left, lane 2
versus 1). In this test, HDHS inhibited the AR-LBD dose dependently just as Casodex did (Fig. 1C, left, lanes 3 and 4 versus 1).
Second, the AR-LBD interaction with the full-length AR can be
detected by a two-hybrid interaction assay in PC-3 cells through
transfection of GBD-AR-LBD and AR fused with VP16 activation
domain (AR-VP16; ref. 18). Similarly to Fig. 1C (left), the two-hybrid

interaction was stimulated by DHT and the DHT induction was
competitively inhibited by Casodex and HDHS (Fig. 1C, right).
These two tests indicate that HDHS affects the AR by blocking the
action of DHT on the AR-LBD.
Third, it is known that DHT and Casodex binding to the AR will
induce AR nuclear translocation (19). We examined whether HDHS
treatment alone could induce AR nuclear translocation and
compared this with the effects of DHT and Casodex. After steroid
deprivation in LNCaP cells, AR in vehicle-treated cells was
distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1D, a). Treatment
with DHT increased the nuclear to whole-cell ratio of AR (Fig. 1D,
e). Similarly, treatment with Casodex increased the nucleus AR
ratio (Fig. 1D, b). Treatment with 5 to 10 Amol/L of HDHS also
resulted in significant AR accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 1D,
c and d). DHT cotreatment with Casodex or HDHS also showed the
same nuclear translocation of AR (Fig. 1D, f–h). As HDHS, such as
DHT and Casodex, induces AR nuclear translocation, and as HDHS
acts on the AR-LBD, this suggests that HDHS may bind to the
AR-LBD as an antiandrogen.
HDHS inhibits cell growth in androgen-responsive PCa cells.
Because AR is a critical growth determinant for PCa cells, the AR
suppression effects of HDHS may also suppress the malignant
growth of PCa cells (20–23). First, we tested the effects of
HDHS on cell viability in various PCa cell lines, including
androgen-dependent LNCaP, androgen-responsive 22Rv1 cells,
and androgen-independent PC-3 cells, and compared them with
untransformed fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells. After treating different
cell lines with increasing doses of HDHS for 48 h, cell viability
was determined by MTT assay, which quantitatively measures the

www.aacrjournals.org

metabolic activity of living cells. HDHS concentrations above
10 Amol/L strongly reduced cell viability in LNCaP and 22Rv1
cells but the negative effect was far less pronounced in PC-3 cells
(LNCaP versus PC-3 or 22Rv1 versus PC-3) and NIH-3T3 cells
(Fig. 2A).
Second, the long-term effect of HDHS on the malignant growth
of AR-dependent (22Rv1 and LNCaP) and AR-independent (PC-3)
PCa cells was examined by colony-forming growth assay. The doseresponse curves of PCa cells for relative colony growth showed that
2.5 to 10 Amol/L of HDHS exerted higher antiproliferation efficacy
on AR-dependent PCa cells than on AR-independent PCa cells
(LNCaP versus PC-3 or 22Rv1 versus PC-3; Fig. 2B). The IC50
(antiproliferation potency) of HDHS on 22Rv1, LNCaP, and PC-3
cells was 6.3, 7.5, and 13.2 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 2B). The
differential effect was also reflected in the morphology of treated
cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells treated with 10 to
50 Amol/L of HDHS for 48 h exhibited cell rounding and surface
blebbing, indicating apoptosis, whereas PC-3 cells treated with up
to 50 Amol/L HDHS exhibited only cell rounding. All these above
results suggested that HDHS possesses potent and selective toxicity
toward AR-dependent PCa cells. The effect of HDHS on the cell
cycle of these different cell lines was further studied by flow
cytometry.
HDHS influences cell cycle progression in AR-dependent
and AR-independent PCa cells differently. The effects of HDHS
on the cell cycle distribution of PCa cells were examined to
determine potential mechanisms of growth suppression (Table 1).
After HDHS treatment for 48 h, there was a significant increase in
the sub-G1 cell population along with decreases in the G0-G1 and

alteration of cell cycle profiles in AR-dependent PCa cells on HDHS
treatment was highly dose dependent. In LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells,
the G0-G1 populations modestly increased with 5 Amol/L HDHS
and drastically decreased with 10 Amol/L HDHS; meanwhile, the

similar effects as those seen at 48 h except for a lower degree of
alterations in all tested cell lines (data not shown). In contrast,

change in the cell cycle distribution in any of the three PCa cell

analyzed apoptosis in treated cells via measurement of nucleosome
release in PCa cells. Apoptosis was significantly induced in LNCaP
and 22Rv1 cells treated with 5 to 10 Amol/L of HDHS for 24 h but
not in PC-3 cells (Fig. 3A). 22Rv1 cells with AR expression are
ablation resistant but respond to androgen stimulation; HDHS led
to their apoptosis. These data also suggest that a similar
mechanism may mediate the effects of HDHS on cell cycle
progression in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. On the other hand,
treatment of 22Rv1 cells with Casodex up to 10 Amol/L for 24 h,
however, failed to induce apoptosis.
During apoptosis, various caspases are activated, which are
involved in the cleavage and activation of a range of critical cellular
substrates, including activation of the DNA repair enzyme PARP
(16, 17). In the presence of 10 Amol/L HDHS, PARP cleavage was
observed, and at the same time, caspase-3 and caspase-7 were
activated by proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 3B, lane 5). These results
confirmed the flow cytometry observation that HDHS stimulates
apoptosis in LNCaP cells (Table 1) and the observed nucleosome
release (Fig. 3A). In contrast, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7
or cleavage of PARP was not detected in PC-3 cells treated with
10 Amol/L HDHS for 24 h (Fig. 3B, lane 10). Tumor suppressor p53
is a critical control for the G1 checkpoint and cell apoptosis, and
LNCaP cells express wild-type p53 (24). LNCaP cells treated with
10 Amol/L HDHS for 24 h had a 3-fold increase in p53; concurrently,
levels of the antiapoptotic regulator Bcl-xL decreased by f50%
(Fig. 3B, lane 5).

HDHS decreases expression of G1-associated cyclins and
CDKs in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The molecular mechanisms for
HDHS-induced G0-G1 cell cycle arrest were further assessed by the
expression of the cyclins and CDKs that operate in the G1 phase in
PCa cells (12, 13). HDHS treatment of LNCaP cells for 24 h resulted
in a concentration-dependent decrease in cyclins D1 and E (Fig. 4,
lanes 3–5). Moreover, HDHS also decreased the protein levels of
CDK4, CDK6, and CDK2 (Fig. 4, lanes 3–5). Protein expression of
CDK inhibitors operative at the G1 checkpoint, p21 and p27, also
increased in the presence of 10 Amol/L HDHS (Fig. 4, lane 5). The
HDHS-mediated down-regulation of CDKs and cyclins together
suggests that CDK kinase activity and the consequent phosphorylation of Rb may decrease. Indeed, HDHS treatment markedly
decreased the phosphorylation of Rb in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4, lanes
3–5). All the above phenomena were also observed in PC-3 cells
treated with HDHS, only at a lower magnitude than in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 4, lane 10 versus 5). As a comparison, Casodex treatment in
LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 6) failed to lead to any
significant change in cell cycle (Table 1). Taken together, our results
indicate that HDHS induces apoptosis in AR-dependent PCa cells
by arresting cell cycle at the G1-checkpoint and activating
apoptotic signaling pathways, whereas only cell cycle arrest was
observed in AR-independent PCa cells on HDHS treatment.

clinical limitation for hormonal therapy (25, 26). The potential of
HDHS to withhold the growth of PCa in vivo was tested in athymic
nude mice with a 22Rv1 tumor. Once the tumor grew to palpable
size 1 week after 22Rv1 cells were implanted, HDHS was
administrated by gavage once daily at doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg
body weight. We measured the PCa growth according to tumor size
and tumor mass at the end of HDHS treatment; both results
revealed that oral intake of HDHS significantly retarded PCa
growth (Fig. 5A and B). End-point tumor mass showed the dosedependent suppression effects of HDHS (0.5 versus 2.5 mg/kg;
P V 0.05; Fig. 5B). During the 24-day HDHS regimen, mice did not
exhibit any symptoms of toxicity such as loss of appetite, decreased
locomotion, or any other apparent signs of illness. As shown in
Fig. 5C, body weight of tested mice was not influenced by HDHS at
up to 2.5 mg/kg/d.
Oral intake of HDHS induces apoptosis along with a decline
in cell proliferation and AR expression in PCa 22v1 xenografted nude mice. Our in vitro assays showed that HDHS
inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in AR-dependent
PCa cells; therefore, we went on to examine the in vivo effects of
HDHS on proliferation and apoptosis in tumor xenografts by
immunohistochemistry. Staining for proliferative tumor cells with
human-specific Ki-67 antibody further revealed that oral intake of
0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg/d of HDHS for 24 days decreased the number of
cells positively stained for Ki-67 (Fig. 5D, a–c) and resulted in an

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

increase of apoptotic tumor cells positively stained by the TUNEL
method (Fig. 5D, d–f ). The antiproliferation and apoptosis
induction effects induced by HDHS ingestion were statistically
significant and the results were dose dependent (Fig. 5D, right).
Moreover, we stained the AR expression in tumor cells, which also
indicated activity of the androgen-AR axis. A prevalent decrease of
AR expression was found in HDHS-treated tumors, although they
remained positively stained for AR (Fig. 5D, g–i). This result agreed
with the in vitro effect of HDHS (Fig. 1B) and suggested a
debilitating activity of AR in vivo.
Oral intake of HDHS achieved effective concentrations in
plasma and in tumors in nude mice. To further understand the
dose-effect relationships, the attainable levels of HDHS in plasma
and tumors were detected 24 h after the last dose of HDHS regimen
in the tested mice. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A and C,
control mice receiving vehicle only showed undetectable levels of
HDHS in both plasma and tumors (chromatograms b), whereas
HDHS ingestion resulted in sharp dose-dependent peaks in plasma
and tumor levels in HPLC profiles (chromatograms c and d). Oral
administration of 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg of HDHS resulted in 0.45 F 0.14
and 1.45 F 0.30 Amol/L of HDHS in plasma (Supplementary
Fig. S1B) and accumulated 98.45 F 19.80 and 154.93 F 12.97 nmol/g
of HDHS in tumor tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These increases
of HDHS concentrations in plasma and tumors were dose dependent
and coherent with the extent of tumor suppression (Fig. 5A and B).

A New Antiandrogen Suppresses Prostate Tumor Growth

Discussion
AR is critical for the growth and recurrence of PCa. This study
shows the efficacy and potency of a new antiandrogen, HDHS, in
inhibiting AR activity in PCa, which approximates that of a currently
used antiandrogen. More importantly, HDHS was found to be
antiproliferative and proapoptotic against an ablation-resistant
22Rv1 tumor still expressing AR and responsive to androgen.
Furthermore, HDHS also inhibited PC-3 cells with a lower potency
via cell cycle arrest, an AR-negative and completely androgenindependent line. There may thus be an additional unknown target
with a lower affinity to HDHS in PC-3 cells. The effect of HDHS was
superior to the long-used commercial antiandrogen Casodex. Data
presented in this study indicate that daily ingestion of HDHS at a
dose that was well tolerated over 24 days reduced the tumor growth
f40% and attained a systemic level of HDHS falling within its
beneficial range. These characteristics suggest that HDHS may
afford a longer period of response or a lower chance of recurrence
than the current antiandrogens used in PCa treatment.

Cytotoxicity and antiproliferation tests showed that HDHS
suppresses AR-dependent LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells more profoundly
than AR-independent PC-3 and untransformed NIH-3T3 cells,
suggesting a specific activity rather than general cytotoxicity. In
addition, HDHS has low inhibitory effect on untransformed NIH-3T3
cells even in high dose range, which implies that HDHS may have less
toxicity to normal cells and more advantages for clinical application.
In addition to HDHS, we have taken the strategy by targeting the AR
activity in 22Rv1 cells and identified four bioactive compounds in
Wedelia chinensis and the ‘‘synergism’’ exerted by particular
proportions in the herbal extract (9, 10). We hereby compare with
HDHS the potency and efficacy of the Wedelia compounds and
formula on antiproliferation (Supplementary Table S1).
Our cell cycle analysis provides the first evidence that HDHS
promoted G0-G1 cell cycle arrest in PCa cells and induced
apoptosis in AR-dependent cells possibly through additional
mechanisms (Table 1). In AR-dependent PCa cells, G1 arrest
induced by 10 Amol/L HDHS was followed by stimulation of

apoptosis, thereby damping the cell viability (Fig. 2A). In ARindependent PCa cells, 10 Amol/L HDHS arrested the cell cycle in
the G1 phase without influencing cell viability, but in the long run,
the colony-forming growth was still inhibited (Fig. 2B).
As well as being associated with AR, the proapoptotic effects of
HDHS in LNCaP cells are also associated with activation of p53; in
PC-3 cells null for p53 expression, HDHS arrested the cell cycle
without proapoptotic effects (24). Whether or not loss of p53 is
involved in controlling HDHS-induced apoptosis needs to be further
studied. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death characterized by cell
shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, DNA
fragmentation, and selective cleavage of vital proteins by caspases
(16, 17). Caspases play important roles in apoptosis triggered by
various proapoptotic signals (27, 28). In HDHS-treated LNCaP cells,
we observed activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7, cleavage of
PARP, and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein in
HDHS-treated LNCaP cells. Although the apoptotic signaling
induced by HDHS remains largely unknown, the associated caspase
activation and regulation of Bcl-2 family members may be involved
with a permeability increase of mitochondrial outer membrane and
release of cytochrome c, which is responsible for the activation of
both caspase-7 and caspase-3.
The significance of HDHS is stressed by its efficacy at
suppressing 22Rv1 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice (Fig. 5).
Although many natural products exhibit potent chemopreventive
activities in vitro, their activity against tumors in vivo is negligible
due to their poor pharmacokinetic properties. In the cases of
curcumin and the green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate, absorption
from the gastrointestinal tract is poor, even when systemically
administered; the phytocompounds are quickly excreted through
hepatic metabolism (29, 30). HDHS fed by gavage to mice, however,
resulted in antiproliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo as

examined by Ki-67 staining and TUNEL assay; these results agreed
with the overall antitumor effects (Fig. 5). Moreover, these effects
were dose dependent and positively correlated with the increase of
HDHS in plasma and tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). It is
understandable that immediately after HDHS ingestion the
systemic concentrations of HDHS were at a much higher level
(peak effect) and remained at that level for some time (duration of
action) before falling to a therapeutic margin (fluctuation). Indeed,
levels as high as 98.5 F 19.8 and 154.9 F 12.97 nmol/g of HDHS
accumulated in the tumor tissues of 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg test groups.
These concentrations were high enough to cause antiproliferation
and apoptosis. The efficacy of HDHS both in vitro and in vivo is
sufficient to warrant further studies to investigate the potential for
HDHS in prevention and therapy of PCa.
