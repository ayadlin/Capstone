Abstract
The extensive involvement of miRNAs in cancer pathobiology has opened avenues for drug development based
on oncomir inhibition. Dicer is the core enzyme in miRNA processing that cleaves the terminal loop of precursor
microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) to generate mature miRNA duplexes. Using the three-dimensional structure of the
Dicer binding site on the pre-miR-21 oncomir, we conducted an in silico high-throughput screen for small
molecules that block miR-21 maturation. By this method, we identiﬁed a speciﬁc small-molecule inhibitor of miR21, termed AC1MMYR2, which blocked the ability of Dicer to process pre-miR-21 to mature miR-21. AC1MMYR2
upregulated expression of PTEN, PDCD4, and RECK and reversed epithelial–mesenchymal transition via the
induction of E-cadherin expression and the downregulation of mesenchymal markers, thereby suppressing
proliferation, survival, and invasion in glioblastoma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer cells. As a single agent
in vivo, AC1MMYR2 repressed tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis, increasing overall host survival with
no observable tissue cytotoxicity in orthotopic models. Our results offer a novel, high-throughput method to
screen for small-molecule inhibitors of miRNA maturation, presenting AC1MMYR2 as a broadly useful candidate
antitumor drug. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5519–31. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of evolutionarily conserved,
small noncoding RNAs that regulate fundamental cellular
processes through the modulation of gene expression (1, 2).
The biogenesis of miRNAs begins with the transcription of
primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) that undergo further processing within the nucleus, resulting in a hairpin intermediate of
approximately 70 nucleotides (precursor miRNA, pre-miRNA).
The pre-miRNA is then transported out of the nucleus to the
cytoplasm and Dicer, an RNaseIII, removes the "terminal loop

After duplex separation, the guide strand or mature miRNA, is
incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex that
participates in mRNA degradation and/or translational suppression (3, 4).
Tremendous progress has been made during the last few
years to identify novel, tumor-associated miRNAs, which are
known to modulate many biologic pathways related to
cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance (5–7). The aberrant expression of miRNAs is deemed to
be a notable molecular hallmark of human diseases. miR-21
was one of the ﬁrst miRNAs detected in the human genome
and it has been validated to be overexpressed in many
different types of human cancers, such as glioblastomas
(8), gastric tumors (9), breast cancers (10), and colon cancers
(11). Thus, targeting miR-21 and modulating its activity is
emerging as a promising therapeutic option and opens a new
mode of cancer therapy.
To date, biochemically based tools for the sequence-speciﬁc inhibition of miRNA function used in preclinical and
clinical studies include antisense oligonucleotides, locked
nucleic acids, and antagomirs (12). Although satisfactory
results have been reported, there are challenges implicated
in the delivery of these non–small-molecule agents and their
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties are not
ideal for the treatment applications (13). On the basis of
these observations, the discovery of novel and potent small
molecules targeting miRNA is needed, and one must take
into account both the three-dimensional (3D) structure of

miRNAs and the thermodynamics of miRNA–small-molecule
interactions (14).
Recently, in silico 3D structure prediction has undergone
signiﬁcant advances due to the availability of new experimental
data and enhanced computer power and modeling methodologies (15). MC-Fold/MC-Sym, an RNA-structure prediction
program, has been successfully used to accurately predict the
double-helix region of several pre-miRNAs, such as let-7c, miR19, and miR-29a (16). Here, we propose a new high-throughput
screening method for small molecules targeting miR-21 based
on the 3D structure of the Dicer binding site on pre-miR-21 by
integrating the MC-Fold/MC-Sym and AutoDock programs (17).
By screening a small chemical compound library, we identiﬁed a speciﬁc small-molecule inhibitor of miR-21, AC1MMYR2, which directly blocked Dicers' ability to process premiR-21 to mature miR-21. Furthermore, we determined that
AC1MMYR2 was capable of suppressing tumor growth and
invasion partly via the upregulation of miR-21 functional
targets and the reversal of epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in epithelial tumor cells in vitro as well as in orthotopic
nude mouse models.

Materials and Methods
Molecular modeling
The MC-Fold/MC-Sym pipeline is a web-hosted service for
RNA secondary and tertiary structure prediction. The pipeline
consists of uploading RNA sequence to MC-Fold, which outputs secondary structures that are directly input to MC-Sym,
which outputs tertiary structures. Pre-miRNA sequences were
obtained from the miRBase database (http://microrna.sanger.
ac.uk/sequences/). The hairpin loop of the pre-miRNA was
chosen to predict the 3D structure using the MC-Fold/MC-Sym
pipeline described previously. Energy optimization was further
conducted on the 3D model using the TINKER Molecular
Modeling Package (http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/).
Preparation of the receptor structure
For docking with AutoDock, polar hydrogen atoms, Kollman
united charges, and solvent parameters were applied to the
receptor using pmol2q script (http://www.sourceﬁles.org/Scientiﬁc/Biology/Proteins/pmol2q_2.3.0.tar.gz). This script converts the .pdb ﬁle format of the protein template to the .pdbqt
ﬁle format that is compatible with AutoDock program version
4 (http://autodock.scripps.edu/).
Preparation of the ligand structure
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) diversity dataset
(http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/branches/dscb/diversity_explanation.
html) contains 1,990 chemical structures. The ligand .pdbq ﬁles
compatible with AutoDock program version 4 were prepared
from the .pdb ﬁles using the prepare_ligand.py script.
Molecular docking and postdocking analysis
High-throughput docking-based virtual screening was conducted using AutoDock program version 4. The rotational
bonds of the ligands were treated as ﬂexible, whereas the
receptor was kept rigid. Grid boxes were ﬁxed around the

Dicer-binding site as the grid box center. Protein–ligand
interactions were analyzed and visualized using Jmol
(http://jmol.sourceforge.net/).
Cell culture and treatment
Human epithelial cancer cell lines (U87 and LN229 glioblastoma cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and
SGC7901 gastric cancer cells) were purchased from China
Academia Sinica Cell Repository (Shanghai, PR China). The
cell lines were tested 1 month before the experiments for
authentication with the methods including morphologic analysis, growth curve analysis, and mycoplasma detection, which
were conducted according to the American Type Culture
Collection cell line veriﬁcation test recommendations. Genotyping of the cells used are: U87 (PTEN del/P53 wt), LN229
(PTEN wt/P53 wt), MCF-7 (PTEN wt/P53 wt), MDA-MB-231
(PTEN wt/P53 mut), and SGC7901 (P53 mut). The cells of
MDA-MB-231 were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 (Gibco),
whereas the others were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Gibco), 2 mmol/L glutamine (Sigma), 100 mg/mL penicillin
(Sigma), 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma), and incubated at
37 C in 5% CO2. AC1MMYR2 was obtained from the NCI
diversity dataset and diluted to the indicated concentrations
in cell culture media. Dicer siRNA sequence, As-miR-21 oligonucleotide, miR-21 mimics, and pre-miR-21 wild-type and
mutant plasmids were purchased from GenePharma Co., Ltd.
and transfections were conducted as previous described (18).
Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses
Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses were
conducted according to the manufacturers' instructions as
previously described (19). For Western blot analyses, the band
density of speciﬁc proteins was quantiﬁed after normalization
with the density of GAPDH.
FISH, immunoﬂuorescence, and cell biological functions
assays
FISH detection of miR-21 was conducted as previously
described (20). Immunoﬂuoresence staining was conducted
using antibodies against E-cadherin, N-cadherin, b-catenin,
and ZEB1/2 (1:100 dilutions; Cell Signaling Technology), and
the cells were visualized using FV-1000 laser scanning confocal
microscopes. The assays for colony formation, cell cycle,
apoptosis, and Transwell were reported previously (21).
Caspase-3/7 activity was measured using Caspase-Glo 3/7
reagent (Promega).
Orthotopic nude mouse models and treatment
BALB/c-A nude mice at 4 weeks of age were purchased from
the Animal Center at the Cancer Institute at Chinese Academy
of Medical Science (Beijing, PR China). To establish intracranial gliomas, 0.5  105 U87 glioblastoma cells transduced with
luciferase lentivirus were implanted stereotactically (22). Seven
days postimplantation, the mice were randomly assigned to
two groups (n ¼ 6 per group). The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
group [100 mL DMSO/DMEM (1:1)] and the AC1MMYR2 group
[AC1MMYR2 (25 mg/kg) dissolved in 100 mL DMSO/DMEM

survival period. Mice were imaged for Fluc activity using
bioluminescence imaging on days 0 (the ﬁrst day of drug
administration), 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 47. In addition, the body
weight and overall survival time of mice were also monitored.
For MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 orthotopic breast cancer models,
5  106 MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 tumor cells transduced with
luciferase lentivirus were injected into mammary fat pads of
each nude mouse. Seven days after implantation, AC1MMYR2
(25 mg/kg) or DMSO was administered by intraperitoneal
injection (n ¼ 6 per group) every 3 days for 35 days, mice
were imaged for Fluc activity on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35, and
the tumor volume was calculated with a caliper using the
formula: volume ¼ length  width2. At the end of the experiment on day 35, the mice were killed, tumor weight was
measured, and mice hearts, lungs, livers, spleens, and kidneys
were removed for bioluminescent imaging.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining, TUNEL staining, and
immunohistochemistry analysis
The parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections were used for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, TUNEL staining, and immunohistochemistry analysis as previous described (21). For
immunohistochemistry analysis, the sections were incubated
with primary antibodies (1:100 dilutions) overnight at 4 C,
followed by a biotin-labeled secondary antibody (1:100 dilutions) for 1 hour at 37 C and then incubated with ABCperoxidase and 3,30 -diaminobenzidine, counterstained with
hematoxylin and visualized using a light microscope.
Statistical analyses
SPSS 16.0 (SPSS) was used for all calculations. All data are
represented by the mean  SD. Statistical signiﬁcance was
determined at P < 0.05.

Results
Discovery of AC1MMYR2, a potent and selective inhibitor
of miR-21
To screen small-molecule inhibitors of miR-21, we proposed a high-throughput screening method for small molecules targeting miR-21 based on the 3D structure of the
Dicer binding site on pre-miR-21. A schematic representation of our workﬂow is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1A.
The sequence of the pre-miR-21 hairpin loop (Dicer binding
site on pre-miR-21) was generated from the miRBase database and then input to the MC-Fold/MC-Sym pipeline to
construct a 3D model (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). For
this model, we analyzed energy optimization using TINKER.
Next, we conducted high-throughput molecular docking
for pre-miR-21 against the 1,990 NCI/diversity compounds
using the AutoDock program (Supplementary Table S1). The
speciﬁc docking process can be visualized in Supplementary
Video S1. Here, our dockings revealed 48 compounds with
high-binding afﬁnity (indicated by DeltaG, Supplementary
Table S2). The top 5 were further assessed for miR-21
inhibition efﬁcacy in 4 human epithelial cancer cells (U87
and LN229 glioblastomas cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells,

www.aacrjournals.org

and SGC7901 gastric cancer cells). Both the compound
AC1MMYR2 (also known as NSC211332) and the As-miR21 presented strong inhibition of miR-21 expression in all
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Figure 1A and B display
the chemical structure of AC1MMYR2 (2,4-diamino-1, 3diazinane-5-carbonitrile) and its highest afﬁnity with the
best docking pose.
To evaluate the efﬁcacy of AC1MMYR2 treatment, miR-21
expression was tested using RT-PCR. The compound inhibited
mature miR-21 generation in a dose-dependent manner after
24 hours of treatment (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, AC1MMYR2
(30 mmol/L) caused a time-dependent reduction of mature
miR-21, with an approximate 50% inhibition at 6 hours of
treatment in all cancer cells (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that
AC1MMYR2 could inhibit mature miR-21 generation in a timeand dose-dependent manner.
Next, we examined whether AC1MMYR2 could impact
miR-21 functional targets. Several miR-21 targets have been
evidenced, such as PTEN, PDCD4, and RECK. As shown in Fig.
1E, PTEN (U87 excluded for its deletion phenotype), PDCD4,
and RECK expression levels were signiﬁcantly induced on the
basis of the Western blot assay. Taken together, AC1MMYR2
could repress mature miR-21 generation, thereby modulating
the level of miR-21 targets.
The selectivity and speciﬁcity of AC1MMYR2 interruption
miR-21 generation was further assessed by measuring intracellular miRNA levels using RT-PCR (Fig. 1F). We randomly
chose 11 miRNAs: miR-23b, miR-566, miR-27b, miR-222, miR524-5p, let-7i, miR-218, miR-1280, miR-200a/b, and miR-181d.
After 6 hours of treatment, the expression levels of 11 miRNAs
were virtually unchanged in the 4 cell lines. Twenty-four hours
later, the expression levels of miR-23b, miR-566, miR-27b, miR222, and miR-524-5p were signiﬁcantly reduced, whereas the
expression levels of let-7i, miR-218, miR-1280, and miR-200a/b
were induced. Furthermore, miR-181d expression in U87,
LN229, and MCF-7 cells increased, but the level in SGC7901
cells decreased. These results provided evidence that AC1MMYR2 is a speciﬁc miR-21 inhibitor, whereas the alteration of
11 miRNAs indirectly triggered by AC1MMYR2 requires further
investigation.
AC1MMYR2 speciﬁcally blocks Dicer processing premiR-21 to mature miR-21
Because the identiﬁcation of small-molecule inhibitors
targeting miR-21 was based on the 3D structure of the
Dicer binding site on pre-miR-21, we evaluated whether the
pre-miR-21 expression was changed. As expected, the level of
pre-miR-21 increased in a time-dependent manner in all cell
lines (Fig. 2A). Notably, after 6 hours of treatment, AC1MMYR2
signiﬁcantly induced pre-miR-21 expression by approximately
three-fold over the DMSO (0 hour) group. These results indicated that AC1MMYR2 might directly interact with pre-miR-21
at the binding site of Dicer to prevent the cleavage of pre-miR21 to the mature miRNA. However, as displayed in Fig. 2B,
AC1MMYR2 treatment resulted in the time-dependent reduction of pri-miR-21. After 6 hours of treatment, the compound
greatly repressed pri-miR-21 expression by approximately 50%
relative to the DMSO group.

determine the effect of AC1MMYR2 on pri-miR-21 and premiR-21 expression, we transfected the miR-21 mimics and
PTRE-miR-21(FL) plasmid after the compound treatment in
U87 and MCF-7 cells, respectively (Fig. 2C). This indicated that
miR-21 mimics increased the mature miR-21 levels, whereas
the PTRE-miR-21(FL) plasmid only induced pri-miR-21 and
pre-miR-21 expression levels. These data conﬁrmed that
AC1MMYR2 blocked Dicer processing at the binding site of
pre-miR-21 to repress the mature miR-21 generation.
To verify the potential site of Dicer binding on pre-miR-21
that AC1MMYR2 acts on, we constructed 3 pre-miR-21 point
mutation plasmids, MUT1 (base "a" was deleted), MUT2 (base
"c" was switched to "t") and MUT3 (base "c" was switched to
"g"; Fig. 2D), and a pre-miR-21 wild-type plasmid (WT). After
transfection with the 4 plasmids in U87 and MCF-7 cells, premiR-21 expressions were all upregulated in the transfected
groups, compared with control. Moreover, there was no statistic signiﬁcance between MUTs and wild-type groups in
pre-miR-21 overexpression. However, overexpression of
mature-miR-21 was detected merely in wild-type group; there
were no signiﬁcant changes in MUTs groups in comparison
with control (Fig. 2E). Therefore, we concluded that the point
mutations at Dicer-binding site on pre-miR-21 disturbed Dicer
processing pre-miR-21 to mature miR-21.
To analysis whether these point mutations also inﬂuenced
AC1MMYR2 action, we created the 3D structure of pre-miR-21
hairpin loop with such mutations. After AC1MMYR2 respectively docking with these 3D models (Fig. 2F), the estimated
free energy of binding was 5.15 kcal/mol, 4.94 kcal/mol,
and 5.84 kcal/mol, whereas the binding afﬁnity of wild-type
was 12.04 kcal/mol (Supplementary Table S2). Consequently,
we conﬁrmed that point mutations at Dicer binding site might
attenuate AC1MMYR2 binding afﬁnity and thus weaken its
activity. Therefore, AC1MMYR2 probable speciﬁcally blocked
the Dicer binding site on pre-miR-21. Besides, we proved that
AC1MMYR2 selectively targeted tumor cells with miR-21 high
expression (Supplementary Fig. S3), which also showed the
speciﬁcity of AC1MMYR2 towards miR-21 to some extent.
AC1MMYR2 represses mature miR-21 generation via
Dicer-dependent expression
As suggested, Dicer is a central enzyme in miRNA processing
(24). To further investigate whether the AC1MMYR2 speciﬁc
interruption of Dicer processing correlated with its expression,
we reduced Dicer levels using a siRNA sequence in U87 and
MCF-7 cells. Dicer expression was greatly reduced after transfection relative to the control and scramble (Fig. 3A). Meanwhile, cells transfected with the Dicer siRNA sequence alone
reduced the mature miR-21 expression; however, AC1MMYR2
retreatment after transfection did not induce a more signiﬁcant decrease (Fig. 3B). Confocal microscopy also displayed
miR-21 staining to be attenuated in the cytoplasm of siRNAtransfected cells, whereas no obvious change occurred after
compound retreatment (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data
indicate that AC1MMYR2 functions are dependent on Dicer
expression. The compound could not effectively repress
mature miR-21 generation when Dicer levels were low and
the underlying mechanism demands intensive study.

AC1MMYR2 inhibits tumor cell proliferation and
promotes apoptosis
Excessive epithelial cell proliferation is a hallmark of the
initiation and early growth of primary epithelial cancers (25).
After conﬁrming the target of AC1MMYR2 action, we went on
to test the compound effect on tumor cell biologic characteristics, especially proliferation and apoptosis. FISH assessment
displayed that miR-21 expression was remarkably decreased
after AC1MMYR2 treatment in U87, MCF-7 (Fig. 4A), LN229,
and SGC7901 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Moreover,
reduced miR-21 resulted in decreased colony formation rates
(Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4B) and ﬂow cytometry
analysis showed that the cell cycle was blocked in the G0–G1
phase (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4C).
GO analysis for the biologic processes was conducted on the
534 genes whose expression was signiﬁcantly altered in
response to 6-hour treatment with AC1MMYR2 in U87 glioma
cells (Supplementary Table S3). "Regulation of cell proliferation" was the sixth term on the top 20 most statistically
signiﬁcant (by P value) GO categories (Supplementary Table
S4). Meanwhile, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that there
were 14 different pathways corresponding to the target genes,
of which "pathways in cancer" was most signiﬁcant (P ¼ 5.7E-4,
Supplementary Table S5).
Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining was conducted to
quantify the apoptosis induced by the compound. Compared
with the DMSO group, the AC1MMYR2 treatment caused more
apoptosis and the apoptosis rates were approximately 15%
(Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4D). Speciﬁcally, the cells
that respond to AC1MMYR2 also had higher caspase 3/7
activities (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S4E). On the basis
of the above ﬁndings, we conclude that AC1MMYR2, as a miR21 inhibitor, is potent at suppressing tumor cell growth and
survival.
AC1MMYR2 suppresses tumor-cell migration and
invasion
Migration and invasion are crucial biologic characteristics
for tumor cell metastasis (26) and one mission-critical step in
the metastatic cascade is the process of EMT (27). To investigate whether AC1MMYR2 could impact the migration and
invasiveness of tumor cells, Transwell assays and EMT-associated markers expression levels were detected. As shown
in Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S5A, fewer AC1MMYR2treated tumor cells invaded across the precoated Matrigel
membrane compared with the DMSO-treated cells. In addition,
Western blot analysis indicated that E-cadherin expression
was increased, whereas N-cadherin, b-catenin, ZEB1, ZEB2,
and MMP9 expression levels were reduced after compound
treatment (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Importantly, because the activities of transcriptional factors
are usually associated with their subcellular location, we
further assessed the distribution of the proteins mentioned
above by confocal microscopy. As displayed in Fig. 5C and
Supplementary Fig. S5C, E-cadherin plasmalemmal expression
was upregulated after AC1MMYR2 treatment, accompanied
with a decrease in N-cadherin plasmalemmal expression.
Moreover, in the DMSO group, b-catenin expression was

mainly localized to the nucleus; however, after compound
treatment, nuclear b-catenin expression was reduced and
translocated to the cytoplasm. ZEB1 and ZEB2 nuclear expression levels were also reduced in the compound-treated group.
Antitumor efﬁcacy of AC1MMYR2 in orthotopic models
Our in vitro study suggested that AC1MMYR2 was a potent
miR-21 inhibitor that suppressed tumor cell growth and invasion. To further conﬁrm this, a proof-of-principle experiment
was used, using an orthotopic glioma model, two orthotopic
breast cancer models, and an AC1MMYR2-mediated antitumor therapeutic approach.
For U87 glioma intracranial model, bioluminescence imaging showed tumor growth stasis in the AC1MMYR2-treated
group compared with the DMSO-treated tumors and on day 14,
a statistically signiﬁcant difference in tumor volume appeared
between the 2 groups (Fig. 6A and B). The body weights of the
mice in the treatment group increased constantly during their

overall survival time, whereas the DMSO-treated mice lost in
weight (Fig. 6C). Only 2 mice in the AC1MMYR2 treatment
group died on day 47, whereas there were no mice alive in the
DMSO treatment group (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, H&E staining
displayed that the tumors formed by DMSO-treated cells
exhibited extensive branch-like growing patterns and vessels
that spread into the surrounding tissue. In contrast, AC1MMYR2-treated cells formed oval-shaped tumors with smooth
margins and a noninvasive front, further validating that the
invasive behavior of glioma could be suppressed by AC1MMYR2. Meanwhile, miR-21 expression was markedly
decreased, but apoptotic nuclei were increased in the compound treatment group (Fig. 6E).
We also stained for an astrocyte differentiation marker,
GFAP, existed during the process of differentiation (28). A
signiﬁcant increase in GFAP expression was observed in
cells treated with AC1MMYR2, which indicated that the
malignancy of glioblastomas was attenuated by AC1MMYR2

to a certain extent. Besides, the expressions of PCNA, Ki67,
cyclin D1, b-catenin, ZEB1/2, and MMP9 decreased, whereas
RECK, PDCD4, and E-cadherin expression levels were simultaneously increased in AC1MMYR2-treated group relative to
the DMSO-treated group (Fig. 6F). Furthermore, H&E staining of multiple tissues showed no discernible toxicity of
AC1MMYR2, including in the liver and kidney (Supplementary Fig. S6).
As previously reported, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are
highly metastatic compared with MCF-7 cells (29). AC1MMYR2
also inhibited MDA-MB-231 cells proliferation and invasion in
vitro (Supplementary Fig. S7–S9). To further monitor treatment efﬁcacy in live animals, we constructed not only a MCF-7
orthotopic breast cancer model but also a highly metastatic
MDA-MB-231 orthotopic model. Bioluminescence imaging
showed tumor growth stasis in the AC1MMYR2-treated group

compared with the DMSO-treated tumors and on day 7, a
statistically signiﬁcant difference appeared in tumor volume
(Fig. 7A–C). At the termination of the study, the tumor weights
were signiﬁcantly different between the 2 groups (Fig. 7D) and
we also found lung metastasis in MDA-MB-231 orthotopic
model but no organ metastasis in MCF-7 orthotopic model.
AC1MMYR2 treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the MDA-MB-231
cells lung metastasis (Fig. 7E). Meanwhile, tumors derived from
DMSO-treated groups revealed more nuclei and darker chromatin staining compared with the AC1MMYR2 treatment
group, as determined by H&E staining. The expression levels
of PTEN, RECK, PDCD4 and E-cadherin, and apoptotic
nuclei were increased, whereas miR-21, PCNA, cyclin D1, Ki67,
N-cadherin, b-catenin, ZEB1/2, and MMP9 expressions were
signiﬁcantly reduced in tumor specimens from the compound
treatment group (Supplementary Fig. S10A and S10B).

In summary, our in vivo preclinical efﬁcacy trials showed a
remarkable antitumor effect of AC1MMYR2 in both glioblastoma and breast cancer orthotopic models.

Discussion
Although the existing anticancer drugs show promise during
early treatment, neoplasms of high malignancy and metastasis
are still considered incurable. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop potential and novel drugs for cancer treatment
(30). Currently, miRNA-based gene therapy offers the theoretical appeal of targeting multiple gene networks and has
garnered increasing attention (31). However, given the challenges involved in the use of nucleotide analogs, the development of natural small-molecule inhibitors targeting speciﬁc
miRNAs and regulating their activities would be a promising
approach (32). With the recent deeper understanding of
miRNA structure and the thermodynamics of miRNA–smallmolecule interactions, computer-aided drug design offers
promise because it can improve the efﬁciency of the drug

pipeline dramatically in a cost-effective way compared with
traditional strategies for RNA-targeted lead identiﬁcation (33).
To our knowledge, Gumireddy and colleagues (34) reported the
ﬁrst use of small molecules as inhibitors of miRNA-21. They
conducted a primary screen of more than 1,000 compounds,
conducted structure–activity relationship analyses, and identiﬁed diazobenzene and its derivatives as effective inhibitors of
miR-21 function. Recently, Bose and colleagues (35) screened
15 known aminoglycosides and determined that the tuberculosis drug, streptomycin, was also a small miR-21 inhibitor.
However, both of these studies focused on the drug screening
process and their chemical characteristics and did not further
investigate antitumor efﬁcacy, particularly in preclinical pharmacodynamic studies in vivo.
In this study, we constructed a 3D model of the pre-miR-21
hairpin loop and Dicer binding domain. By high-throughput
molecular docking to the 1,990 NCI diversity compounds
and further miR-21 inhibition analysis, AC1MMYR2 was identiﬁed as a speciﬁc miR-21 small-molecule inhibitor, which

speciﬁcally blocked Dicer processing pre-miR-21 to maturemiR-21. Recently, a transcriptional regulatory circuit involving
miR-21, PTEN-AKT pathway, and NF-kB-IL-6-STAT3 positive
feedback loop was reported in cancers. Inhibition of miR-21
expression increases the PTEN expression, thereby reduces the
AKT activity and subsequently inhibits NF-kB activity and
interleukin (IL)-6 production. Moreover, STAT3, a transcription factor activated by IL-6, directly activates miR-21 (36). On
the basis of these, we supposed that overexpression of PTEN
induced by AC1MMYR2 inhibited the AKT activity and then
suppressed NF-kB-IL-6-STAT3 positive feedback loop (PTEN
and pSTAT3 expressions were presented in Fig. 1E), ultimately
resulted in the inhibition of pri-miR-21 transcription. Thus, we
established a positive feedback loop between STAT3 and primiR-21, which certainly required further investigation in
future.

associated with tumor cell survival, proliferation, and inva-

sion (37, 38, 20), were upregulated after AC1MMYR2 treatment. More importantly, altered expression levels of a set of
miRNAs, such as miR-200a/b and miR-181d, were observed
after AC1MMYR2 treatment. It is reported that miR-21
overexpression in epithelial cancers facilitates the initiation
of EMT (39, 40). EMT is an evolutionarily conserved process
that allows polarized epithelial cells to undergo multiple
biochemical changes to adopt mesenchymal cell characteristics, such as enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness,
and elevated resistance to apoptosis (41). Several transcriptional factors, including Snail1/2, ZEB1/2, and Slug have
been reported to be involved in EMT (42). On the basis of the
preceding observations, we indicated that miR-200a directly
interacted with b-catenin and ZEB1/2 to reverse EMT in
U251 glioblastoma and SGC7901 gastric cancer cells (43) and
that b-catenin and ZEB1 were also functional targets of miR181d (unpublished data). In addition, PTEN inhibition of
b-catenin activation via the downregulation of pAKT has

In many cancer types, the loss of E-cadherin coincides with a
gain of expression of the mesenchymal cadherin, N-cadherin.
This "cadherin switch" is considered to be a hallmark of EMT
(45). However, it was reported that epithelial cell adhesion
complexes reorganized and cell proliferation was suppressed
upon exogenous expression of the E-cadherin gene (46); simultaneously, the cells that passed through EMT lost their mesenchymal phenotype (41). Increased expression of E-cadherin
was also well established to be an antagonist of invasion and
metastasis (47). Sequestration of b-catenin in the cytoplasm
was essential for the preservation of the epithelial features of
cancer cells. When b-catenin relocalizes from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm, it can reverse the migratory characteristics of
the cell by reestablishing interactions with E-cadherin and
forming cell–cell adhesions (48). Zinc ﬁnger E-box binding
homeobox proteins, ZEB1 and ZEB2, which are well known
transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, are both implicated in
EMT and tumorigenesis (49). Thus, cells overexpressing
b-catenin, ZEB1, and ZEB2 cause them to be more susceptible
to EMT. In our study, in combination with upregulated Ecadherin, AC1MMYR2 signiﬁcantly reduced the nuclear
expression levels of b-catenin and ZEB1/2, as well as the
expression of MMP9, thereby reversing EMT in the epithelial
cancers. This may be another underlying mechanism of AC1MMYR2 to facilitate the suppression of the tumor growth and
invasion.
Moreover, it remains highly interesting that an astrocyte
differentiation marker, GFAP, had its expression level induced
in U87 intracranial samples after AC1MMYR2 treatment. A
recent study observed the coexpression of GFAP/Slug and
GFAP/Twist in mesenchymal areas of gliosarcoma and indicated that it may represent an initial step in glial–mesenchymal transition (50). On the basis of these observations, we
considered that a potential association might exist between
GFAP levels and EMT. Increased GFAP expression, with the
simultaneous reduction of mesenchymal marker expression
levels induced by AC1MMYR2, perhaps indicated a reacquisition of epithelial characteristics, which certainly requires
further investigations.
In this study, we propose a novel high-throughput screening
method for small molecules targeting miRNAs and identify a
potent and speciﬁc miR-21 inhibitor, AC1MMYR2, which

shows remarkable antitumor efﬁcacy not only through an
induction of common functional targets (PTEN, PDCD4, and
RECK) but also the reversibility of epigenetic mechanisms (i.e.,
reversion of EMT through upregulation of miR-200a/b and
miR-181d; Supplementary Fig. S11). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of AC1MMYR2 upregulation of miR-200a/b
and miR-181d warrants further study. Taken together, our
results showed the robust antitumor efﬁcacy of AC1MMYR2
without any observable toxicity to normal tissues, which
highlighted its promising use clinically. AC1MMYR2 compound derivatives might have potential as anticancer agents
in epithelial cancers in the future.
