ABSTRACT
The recurrent V617F mutation in JAK2 (JAK2V617F) has emerged as the primary
contributor to the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, the
lack of complete response in most patients treated with the JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib,
indicates the need for identifying pathways that cooperate with JAK2. Activated
JAK2 was found to be associated with the insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) in nonhematological cells. We identified JAK2/IRS2 binding in JAK2V617F HEL cells, but not in
the JAK2WT U937 cell line. In HEL cells, IRS2 silencing decreased STAT5 phosphorylation,
reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis; these effects were enhanced when IRS2
silencing was combined with ruxolitinib. In U937 cells, IRS2 silencing neither reduced
cell viability nor induced apoptosis. IRS1/2 pharmacological inhibition in primary
MPN samples reduced cell viability in JAK2V617F-positive but not JAK2WT specimens;
combination with ruxolitinib had additive effects. IRS2 expression was significantly
higher in CD34+ cells from essential thrombocythemia patients compared to healthy
donors, and in JAK2V617F MPN patients when compared to JAK2WT. Our data indicate that
IRS2 is a binding partner of JAK2V617F in MPN. IRS2 contributes to increased cell viability
and reduced apoptosis in JAK2-mutated cells. Combined pharmacological inhibition of
IRS2 and JAK2 may have a potential clinical application in MPN.

regardless of JAK2 mutation status, and the knowledge that
many receptors and substrates may lead to the activation
of the JAK/STAT, MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways
through mechanisms other than the JAK2 pathway suggest
that other interacting proteins may be involved in the
pathophysiology of these diseases [4, 5].
In non-hematological cells, previous studies have
reported that JAK2 can associate with the insulin receptor
substrate 2 (IRS2). JAK2 co-immunoprecipitates with
IRS2 following angiotensin II stimulation in the left
ventricle of rats [6, 7], and upon leptin stimulation in
the rat liver [8]. IRS2 is a 180kDa adapter protein that

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are
characterized by clonal defects that result in increased
myeloid proliferation with preserved terminal differentiation
[1]. The identification of a recurrent mutation in the tyrosine
kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2V617F) in most patients with
primary myelofibrosis (PMF), polycythemia vera (PV)
and essential thrombocythemia (ET) suggest a potential
common main cause of disease development [2, 3].
However, the description of other recurrent mutations, the

was described in 1995 as being the equivalent to the
4PS protein, initially identified as a substrate of the IL4
receptor-associated tyrosine kinase in myeloid cells [9].
IRS2 associates with the p85 subunit of PI3K and with
GRB2 and mediates mitogenic and antiapoptotic signaling
from IR, IGF1R, EPOR, MPL, VEGF, insulin, leptin,
GH, interleukins and IFNα/β/γ, which can influence the
proliferation of neoplastic cells [7, 9–17]. During the
erythroid maturation of normal and PV cells, insulin
and IGF1 induce cell signaling through IRS1 and IRS2
phosphorylation [18, 19]. IRS2 expression is higher
in aggressive, metastatic human breast carcinoma cell
lines [16], and mammary tumor cells that are deficient
for IRS2 expression are significantly more sensitive to
apoptotic stimuli, such as serum deprivation [16, 20, 21].
We have previously identified IRS2 phosphorylation to
be upregulated during hematopoietic cell differentiation
[22], although the functional role of IRS2 in hematopoietic
neoplasms has not yet been addressed.
We hypothesized that IRS2 could participate in the
activation of crucial signaling pathways in MPN via direct
binding with JAK2 or through alternative mechanisms. In
this study, we aimed to evaluate JAK2/IRS2 association and
to describe the function of IRS2 in cell viability and apoptosis
using cell lines and primary samples from MPN patients
harboring wild-type or mutant JAK2. IRS2 mRNA expression
levels were investigated in primary CD34+ cells from healthy

RESULTS

HEL cells
Leukemia cell lines harboring the JAK2V617F
mutation (HEL) or JAK2WT (U937, NB4, HL60) were
used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with
anti-IRS2 and anti-JAK2 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that JAK2 binds to IRS2 in HEL
JAK2V617F cells, but not in U937, NB4 and HL60 JAK2WT
cell lines (Figure 1A). Similarly, colocalization of IRS2
and JAK2 by confocal microscopy was higher in HEL
cells in comparison to U937 and NB4 cells (Figure 1B;
Supplementary Figure S1). JAK2 and IRS2 protein
expressions in these cell lines are illustrated in Figure 1C.

U937 cells treated with increasing concentrations of
ruxolitinib for 6h were tested for total and phosphoproteins by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. In
HEL cells, ruxolitinib treatment resulted in decreased
phosphorylation of IRS2, JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, ERK
and P70S6K, but no changes were observed in phosphoAKT levels (Figure 2A). In contrast, U937 cells showed
little to no phosphorylated IRS2 and STAT3 even in
the absence of ruxolitinib treatment, but demonstrated
reduced JAK2, STAT5, ERK and P70S6K phosphorylation
upon ruxolitinib administration (Figure 2B). NB4 cells,
which also harbor wild-type JAK2, showed neither
constitutive phosphorylation of JAK2 nor any reduction in
downstream signaling proteins upon ruxolitinib treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2). Given these findings, HEL
and U937 cells were selected for further study as models
of JAK2V617F and JAK2WT signaling.

treatment on JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK
signaling, shControl and shIRS2 cells were treated
with DMSO or ruxolitinib (100 or 300nM) for 48h, and
submitted to immunoblotting with specific antibodies.
In HEL cells, IRS2 silencing alone was able to induce
decreased phosphorylation of STAT5 and increased
phospho-ERK levels. Ruxolitinib downregulated JAK/
STAT (decreased phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3 and
STAT5) and MAPK signaling (decreased phosphorylation
of ERK and P70S6K), but did not modulate AKT
phosphorylation in HEL cells (Figure 3A). In JAK2WT
U937 cells, however, while IRS2 silencing did not
change STAT5 phosphorylation, increased phospho-ERK
levels were observed (Figure 3B). The individual effects
of IRS2 silencing were not observed in cells submitted
to ruxolitinib 300nM treatment, since such treatment
results in near complete inhibition of phospho-STAT5 and
phospho-ERK by 48h of exposure (Figure 3A–3B).

300nM) or DMSO for 48h (cell viability) or 8 days

were significantly inhibited by IRS2 silencing (p ≤.01),
and these effects were enhanced when IRS2 silencing
was combined with ruxolitinib exposure (all p ≤.02)
(Figure  4A–4B). In U937 cells, IRS2 silencing had no
effects on cell viability and clonogenicity; ruxolitinib did
not significantly suppress cell viability, but decreased the
clonogenicity of these cells (Figure 4C–4D), likely due to
the time of drug exposure necessary for each assay.

levels observed upon additional ruxolitinib treatment
(Figure  5B). However, in U937 cells, IRS2 silencing
alone or associated with ruxolitinib did not affect
apoptosis, as assessed by Annexin V+/PI- and
immunoblotting with anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibodies
(all p ≥.05). Of note, ruxolitinib did not induce apoptosis
in U937 cells (Figure 5C–5D).

Increased IRS2 mRNA expression in patients
harboring the JAK2V617F mutation
IRS2 mRNA levels were evaluated in peripheral
blood CD34+ cells from healthy donors and patients with
MPN. Significantly increased IRS2 mRNA expression
was observed in patients with ET when compared to
healthy donors (0.35 [0.08-2.16] versus 0.18[0.00-2.29];
p =.03). A slight, although not statistically significant,
increase in IRS2 mRNA expression was found in

patients when compared to healthy donors (Figure 6A).
Significantly higher levels of IRS2 mRNA expression
were also observed in JAK2V617F patients when compared
to JAK2WT (0.46 [0.00-5.65] versus 0.29 [0.00-0.83];
p<.001) (Figure 6B). This difference remained significant
when comparing JAK2V617F and JAK2WT patients in
individual groups (ET, PMF) (p ≤.02). Despite the low
IRS2 mRNA expression in JAK2WT PV patients, the
number of wild-type samples was excessively small
(n=2) for statistical analysis (Supplementary Table S3).
IRS2 mRNA expression was significantly lower in
CALRexon9indel_MUT patients compared to CALRWT (0.30
[0.00-0.82] versus 0.42 [0.00-5.65]; p=.02) (Figure 6C);
this difference in IRS2 expression would be expected
since, in this cohort, JAK2V617F and CALR mutations
were mutually exclusive, and CALRMUT patients
represent the JAK2WT patients.

To evaluate the combined effects of IRS2 and
JAK1/2 pharmacological inhibition in MPN primary
cells, mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood
samples obtained from four JAK2V617F and three JAK2WT
MPN patients were submitted to ex vivo treatment with
the IRS/IGF1R inhibitor NT157, ruxolitinib, or both
drugs combined. Six of the seven patients included in
the ex vivo experiments were MPL and CALR wild type;
one patient with ET (sample #6) who had wild type JAK2
and CALR harbored a MPLW515L mutation. In JAK2V617Fpositive primary cells from PMF and PV patients (samples
#1 to #4), a reduced cell viability following NT157 and
ruxolitinib exposure alone was observed, and the combined
treatment with both inhibitors resulted in cumulative effects

NT157 reduced cell viability only in sample #6 (ET patient,
MPLW515L-mutated), while ruxolitinib reduced cell viability

which was not observed in U937, NB4 and HL60 cells
(JAK2WT). The lack of the JAK2/IRS2 association in
U937, NB4 and HL60 cells corroborates the hypothesis
that activated JAK2 is crucial for IRS2 recruitment.
Erythropoeitin induces IRS2 upregulation in primary
erythroblasts and in human acute myeloid leukemia cells
UT7 [14, 24]. Interestingly, IRS2 can associate directly
with both EPOR [14] and JAK2 [6]. JAK2 tyrosine
phosphorylation by EPOR or by other mechanisms leads
to the recruitment of SH2 and PTB domain-containing
proteins and initiates major tyrosine phosphorylation [25,
26]. As such, the IRS2 PTB domain may be involved in the
JAK2/IRS2 association in JAK2V617F cells. Alternatively,
Duan et al. [27] demonstrated that the SH2B adaptor
protein binds simultaneously to both JAK2 and IRS2,
promoting the formation of a JAK2/SH2B/IRS2 tertiary
complex and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of
IRS2 by JAK2. Leptin has been shown to induce JAK2/
IRS2 association in HEK293 cells expressing leptin

DISCUSSION
IRS2 mediates downstream signaling from
EPOR and MPL in hematopoietic cells [14, 23] and
associates with JAK2 upon an extrinsic stimulus in nonhematological cells [6–8]. We hypothesized that the
constitutive activation of JAK2 induced by the V617F
mutation itself could lead to JAK2/IRS2 binding, and that
this protein association could participate in the malignant
phenotype of JAK2V617F-positive MPN patients. We herein
describe that IRS2 is a binding partner of JAK2 in the
human JAK2V617F-positive HEL cell line, an association

apoptotic stimuli [20]. We herein showed that the ex vivo
treatment of JAK2V617F MPN primary cells with the IRS/
IGF1R inhibitor NT157 resulted in reduced cell viability
and had cumulative effects with ruxolitinib. Interestingly,
no evident modulation of cell viability was observed in
JAK2WT primary cells following NT157 or ruxolitinib
exposure alone or in combination, corroborating our
findings that the constitutive activation of signaling
pathways driven by JAK2V617F, including IRS2/JAK2
binding, is necessary for the biological effects of IRS
and JAK1/2 inhibitors. Taken together, these data support
the hypothesis that IRS2 contributes to the malignant
phenotype of JAK2V617F MPN.
Our data indicate that IRS2 is a binding partner
of JAK2V617F and promotes cell survival in MPN. The
additive effects of IRS2 silencing in inducing apoptosis
observed upon co-treatment with ruxolitinib highlights the
potential for use of IRS2 inhibitors in combination with
JAK2 inhibitors in the treatment of these diseases. Future
research using IRS2 inhibition in ex vivo studies, including
a larger cohort of MPN patients, and in MPN animal
models may help to predict the in vivo effectiveness and
collateral effects of IRS2 inhibitors.

receptor only in the presence of SH2B, and leptin was
able to induce neither JAK2 nor IRS2 activation in SH2B/mice [28], indicating that an adaptor protein may also
participate in the JAK2/IRS2 binding.
We herein demonstrated that IRS2 phosphorylation
is increased in HEL cells, when compared to U937 cells.
IRS2 gene expression is also higher in CD34+ cells from
patients with ET, when compared to healthy donors, and
from patients with JAK2V617F MPN compared to JAK2WT
patients, indicating that the JAK2V617F mutation is associated
with increased IRS2 expression. IRS2 lentivirus-mediated
silencing reduced cell viability and clonogenicity and
increased apoptosis in HEL cells (JAK2V617F), but not
in U937 cells (JAK2WT). This might be explained by the
significantly diminished STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation
seen in IRS2-silenced HEL cells. Although phospho-STAT5
was reduced by the JAK1/2 specific inhibitor ruxolitinib,
IRS2 silencing alone significantly downregulated STAT5
activation, suggesting that, in HEL cells, STAT5 may be
activated both by an IRS2-dependent/JAK2-independent
and JAK2-dependent mechanism. This could explain the
additive effects observed in IRS2-silenced/ ruxolitinibtreated cells. Although STAT5 is a classical downstream
protein activated by JAK2, insulin can also induce STAT5
activation in a JAK2-independent manner [29]. In the
rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Kym-1, an insulin receptor
kinase inhibitor abolished the insulin-induced STAT5
tyrosine phosphorylation, but this effect was not obtained
with a JAK2 kinase inhibitor [29]. Recently, Schafranek
and colleagues have also shown that the loss of STAT5
activity, rather than JAK2, is critical for the irreversible
induction of cell death in BCR-ABL-positive cells [30].
Since STAT5 activation decreases apoptosis [31–34] and
induces malignant transformation and tumor progression
[32, 35–38], the STAT5 downregulation promoted by IRS2
inhibition may contribute to the reduced tumor proliferation
and survival in HEL cells. Interestingly, IRS2 silencing
resulted in increased phospho-ERK expression in both HEL
and U937 cells, although IRS2 inhibition reduced survival
only in HEL cells. These data suggest that the increased
ERK phosphorylation induced by IRS2 silencing itself is
not enough to induce the observed effects on cell survival.
The mechanism of ERK phosphorylation and the biological
consequence of this finding needs to be better clarified in
future studies, although, at least in the cell models tested
here, the biological effects of IRS2 inhibition seem to be
independent of ERK phosphorylation status.
The insulin receptor substrates, as major mediators
of downstream pathways involved in cell proliferation and
survival, are important proteins for cancer pathogenesis
[11, 16, 20, 21, 39, 40]. Pharmacological IRS inhibition
was able to inhibit colony formation and cell migration
of human melanoma [39] and prostate cancer cells [41].
Interestingly, however, no effects on the survival of
normal melanocytes were observed [39]. Mammary tumor
cells deficient for IRS2 expression are more sensitive to

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, ruxolitinib treatment and IRS2
silencing
Human cell lines mutated for JAK2V617F (HEL)
or wild-type for JAK2 (U937, NB4 and HL60) were
used. HEL, U937 and HL60 cells were obtained from
ATCC (Philadelphia, PA, USA), NB4 cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Eduardo M. Rego (University of São
Paulo, Brazil). Cell lines were tested and authenticated
by STR matching analysis using the PowerPlex® 16 HS
system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA ) and the ABI 3500
Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA); cells were tested in our laboratory before
manuscript submission. Cells (2 × 105/mL) were incubated
with ruxolitinib (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Switzerland)
or with DMSO for 6 or 48h.

Transduction of lentivirus
HEL and U937 cells were transduced with
lentivirus-mediated shRNA nonspecific control (SC108080) or lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting IRS2
(SC-29378-V) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and named
shControl and shIRS2 cells, respectively. Briefly, 2×105
cells were transduced with lentiviral by spinoculation
at multiplicity of infection equal to 4.0 and selected by
puromycin (0.75μg/mL for HEL and 1.0μg/mL for U937
cells). On day 21, cells were tested for IRS2 inhibition by
qPCR and immunoblotting.

BC, Canada). Colonies were detected after 8 days of
culture by adding 1mg/mL of MTT reagent and scored by
Image J quantification software (US National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). For HEL and U937
cell lines, shControl and shIRS2 cells were submitted to

Assessment of apoptosis

Equal amounts of protein were used for total

antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis with the indicated antibodies (Supplementary
Table S2) and ECL™ Western Blotting Analysis
System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK Ltd.,
Buckinghamshire, UK). Blots were stripped and reprobed
as necessary.

HEL and U937 cells silenced for IRS2 and control
cells were seeded on 12-well plates and treated with
different concentrations of ruxolitinib (100 or 300nM) or
DMSO for 48h. Cells were washed twice with ice cold
PBS and resuspended in binding buffer containing 1μg/
mL PI and 1μg/mL FITC- or APC- labeled Annexin-V.
All specimens were analyzed by flow cytometry using a

Cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with antiIRS2 or anti-JAK2 antibodies (1:200 in 1% BSA PBS),
followed by incubation with secondary antibody (1:400 in
1% BSA PBS) for 2h at room temperature. All incubations
were followed by three 5min PBS washes. The slides
were mounted in ProLong Gold Anti-Fade Mounting
Medium with DAPI (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA).
Images were generated using a confocal laser-scanning
microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City,
UK). The “colocalization finder” plug in of Image J
quantification software (U.S. National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, USA) was used for the analysis of JAK2 and
IRS2 colocalization analysis.

Primary patient samples
Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected
from 99 MPN patients from the outpatient clinic of the
University of Campinas (median age 66, range 20-92;
PV=30, ET=37, PMF=32) and from 28 healthy donors
(median age 44, range 37-51) from the Blood Bank of
the institution. Diagnoses were performed according to
the 2008 World Health Organization criteria [1]. Among
the patients, 64 were positive for the JAK2V617F mutation,
25 had a CALR exon 9 indel mutation, 10 were negative
for both mutations, and 2 patients had a JAK2V617F
mutation but had not been tested for CALR mutations
(due to lack of sample availability). Seventy-one patients
were negative for W515L/K MPL mutations; twentyeight patients were not screened for MPL mutations
due to the unavailability of good quality DNA samples;
from those, only five cases were wild type for both
JAK2 and CALR. This research was approved by the
Institutional and National Review Board in accordance
to the Helsinki Declaration; written informed consent
was obtained from all subjects. Seventy-two out of 99
patients were in regular use of hydroxyurea at the time
of sampling; none had received additional chemotherapy
or a JAK1/2 inhibitor before sampling. CD34+ cells were
isolated from PB mononuclear cells by MIDI-MACS
immunoaffinity columns (Miltenyi Biotec, USA) and
>90% purity was verified by flow cytometry.

Cell viability and colony forming assays
Cell viability was measured by methylthiazole
tetrazolium (MTT) assay for HEL and U937 cells. A
total of 5×104 ShControl or shIRS2 cells per well were
plated in a 96-well plate in RPMI 10% FBS at different
concentrations of ruxolitinib (100 or 300nM) or with
DMSO for 48h. Briefly, 10μL of a 5mg/mL solution of
MTT was added to the wells and incubated at 37°C for
4h. The reaction was stopped by using 100μL of 0.1 N
HCl in anhydrous isopropanol and was evaluated by
measuring the absorbance at 570nm using an automated

This work was supported by the National Council
of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq),
Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia do Sangue
(INCTS) and the São Paulo Research Foundation
(FAPESP). B.J.D. is supported by Howard Hughes
Medical Institute and The Leukemia and Lymphoma

Patients were seen at the Oregon Health & Science
University Center for Hematologic Malignancies
(patients #1 to #3, #5 and #6) or at the Hematology and
Hemotherapy Center of the University of Campinas
(patients #4 and #7). Following informed consent,
peripheral blood was collected and mononuclear cells
were isolated by Ficoll-gradient centrifugation. Cells were
resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% FBS, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin and
plated in 384-well plates (9000 cells/well) in triplicate
in the presence of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (04000nM), the IRS/IGF1R inhibitor NT157 (0-4000nM;
Axon MedChem, USA), or both inhibitors in combination
at the indicated concentrations. Plates were cultured
at 37°C for 72h, and absorbance was measured by a
methanethiosulfonate (MTS)-based assay, according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (CellTiter 96 AQueous
One; Promega) for patients #1 to #3, #5 and #6, or by
methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT) assay for patients #4
and #7. Data were normalized to the mean percent of the
untreated control wells.
