Abstract
Cancer invasion and metastasis occur in a complex three-dimensional (3D) environment, with reciprocal
feedback from the surrounding host tissue and vasculature-governing behavior. In this study, we used a novel
intravital method that revealed spatiotemporal regulation of Src activity in response to the anti-invasive Src
inhibitor dasatinib. A ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging microscopy–ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FLIMFRET) Src biosensor was used to monitor drug-targeting efﬁcacy in a transgenic p53-mutant mouse model of
pancreatic cancer. In contrast to conventional techniques, FLIM-FRET analysis allowed for accurate, timedependent, live monitoring of drug efﬁcacy and clearance in live tumors. In 3D organotypic cultures, we showed
that a spatially distinct gradient of Src activity exists within invading tumor cells, governed by the depth of
penetration into complex matrices. In parallel, this gradient was also found to exist within live tumors, where Src
activity is enhanced at the invasive border relative to the tumor cortex. Upon treatment with dasatinib, we
observed a switch in activity at the invasive borders, correlating with impaired metastatic capacity in vivo. Src
regulation was governed by the proximity of cells to the host vasculature, as cells distal to the vasculature were
regulated differentially in response to drug treatment compared with cells proximal to the vasculature. Overall,
our results in live tumors revealed that a threshold of drug penetrance exists in vivo and that this can be used to
map areas of poor drug-targeting efﬁciency within speciﬁc tumor microenvironments. We propose that using
FLIM-FRET in this capacity could provide a useful preclinical tool in animal models before clinical translation.

Introduction
Maximizing the use of preclinical disease models in drug

aberrant regulation of critical events that drive tumor progression. Intravital imaging is providing new insights on how cells
behave in a more native microenvironment, thereby improving
our understanding of disease progression (1, 2). In combination
with adaptations of in vitro molecular techniques to threedimensional (3D) model systems, intravital imaging is helping
to bridge the gap in our understanding of key biologic events that
govern cancer progression and therapeutic response in vivo (2–4).
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most
lethal forms of human cancer, with 90% of patient deaths occurring within 1 year of diagnosis due to surgically unresectable,
locally advanced, or metastatic disease being present at the time
of clinical diagnosis (5). Systemic therapies are largely ineffective
in inoperable disease, leading to an overall 5-year survival rate of
less than 5% (6, 7). In addition, the tumor microenvironment is
characterized by poor vascularity and extensive deposition of
extracellular matrix (ECM), limiting the accumulation and
perfusion of drug delivery within the tumor tissue (8–10).
Consequently, the development of more effective strategies to
efﬁciently target and treat pancreatic cancer is required.
Recently, we have used a genetically engineered [KrasG12D/þ;
Trp53R172H/þ;Pdx1-Cre (KPC)] mouse model of pancreatic cancer in which Cre-lox technology is used to target KrasG12D and
mutant p53R172H to the pancreas via the Pdx1 promoter (11).
This results in the formation of invasive and metastatic PDAC

that recapitulates the pathology of human disease (12, 13).
Using this model, we have previously shown that introduction
of a mutant p53R172H allele drives a metastatic program over
and above the tumor-promoting effects of p53 loss (14). We and
others have also shown that mutations in p53 provide a gainof-function role that drives metastasis, via disruption of cell–
cell and cell–matrix adhesion, leading to invasion and spread of
disease (14–20).
A number of new therapeutics have been developed to exploit
the deregulation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Src in
cancer and are currently under clinical investigation (21).
Elevated expression and/or activity of Src has been shown to
contribute to various types of invasive tumor cell behavior
including evasion of apoptosis, enhancement of proliferation,
and the deregulation of cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesions,
associated with numerous forms of cancer including pancreatic
cancer (22–24). In line with this, we have recently shown a
correlation between Src upregulation and activation with
reduced survival in human pancreatic cancer, and showed that
the level of Src and phospho-Src are important indicators of
vascular invasion, lymph node positivity, and prognosis in
human PDAC (25). Importantly, we also established that the
small-molecule Src kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, which is currently being clinically evaluated in combination with chemotherapy
in locally advanced PDAC (26), inhibited invasion of primary
PDAC cells generated from this model, and signiﬁcantly reduced
the development of metastases by approximately 50% (25).
As the current therapeutic failure of agents in the treatment
of pancreatic cancer may arise from a potentially reversible
impairment in drug delivery to the tumor (27), it remains to be
determined whether improvements in drug targeting and
effective delivery could enhance the encouraging antimetastatic proﬁle of dasatinib and improve survival in this aggressive disease (25).
Here, we have adopted a ﬂuorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) biosensor, previously used to examine the
dynamic regulation and activation state of Src kinase in vitro
(28), as a preclinical tool to assess drug delivery and efﬁcacy in
live tumors. Using ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
(FLIM) to measure FRET, we have rapidly analyzed and
quantitatively measured Src activity at a single/subcellular
level in vivo and detected effects intractable to standard
techniques. We have investigated aspects of the 3D tumor
environment that may contribute to poor drug targeting, such
as the proximity of cells to the host vasculature or their
location with regards to the tumor cell core or invasive border.
Critically, we exploit this detailed spatial and temporal mapping of drug response to monitor the heterogeneity of tumor
cells in response to new combination therapy that targets the
stromal ECM architecture to favor effective drug delivery
within solid tumor tissue.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Primary mouse PDACs were derived from tumors harvested
from Pdx1-Cre-GFP, LSL-KRasG12D/þ, LSL-Trp53R172H/þ mice
(14). PDACs were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medi-

um (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mmol/L Lglutamine (Invitrogen) and transfected with the ECFP-YPet
Src-FRET biosensor using Polyfect as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen; ref. 28). Cells were selected using
0.6 mg/mL G418 and stable pools generated using standard
procedures.
Multiphoton time-correlated single photon counting
FLIM
Imaging was conducted on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U
inverted microscope with an Olympus long working distance
20 0.95 NA water immersion lens. The excitation source used
for all image acquisition was a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond pulsed
laser (Cameleon), operating at 80 MHz and tuned to a wavelength of 830 nm. For more details, see Supplementary Data.
Fluorescence lifetime imaging of Src-FRET biosensor
in vivo
Following trypsinization, 1  106 cells were resuspended in
100 mL Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) and
subcutaneously injected into the rear ﬂank of a nude mouse.
Tumors were allowed to develop for 7 days. Animals were kept
in conventional animal facilities and all experiments were
carried out in compliance with U.K. Home Ofﬁce guidelines.
To permit imaging, mice were terminally anesthetized using an
anesthetic combination of 1:1 hypnorm–H2O þ 1:1 hypnovel–
H2O. Following induction of anesthesia, the subcutaneous
tumor was surgically exposed and the mouse restrained on
a 37 C heated stage. Multiphoton excited FLIM measurements
were conducted in vivo using the system described earlier.
Typical scan parameters were 150 mm  150 mm ﬁeld of view
over 512 pixels  512 pixels scanned at 400 Hz with the
acquisition of 100 frames. The pixel dwell time was 5 microseconds with a total acquisition time of approximately 120
seconds. Typical laser power as measured at the sample plane
was approximately 30 mW. It was found that PDAC cells
expressing the Src biosensor could be imaged at depths of up
to 150 mm in live tumor tissue. To visualize vasculature,
quantum dots (Qtracker-655; Life Technologies) were tail vein
injected into mice 10 minutes before imaging (10 mL in 190 mL
HBSS). For control- or drug-treated tumor, at least 300 cells
were measured. Columns, mean; error bars, SE; P value by
unpaired Student t test.
Frequency domain FLIM
In vitro ﬂuorescence lifetime measurements were conducted
using a Lambert Instruments ﬂuorescence attachment on a
Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U microscope equipped with a 60
objective and a ﬁlter block consisting of a 436/20 excitation
ﬁlter, a T455LP dichroic mirror, and a 480/40 emission ﬁlter.
For more details, see Supplementary Data.
Organotypic invasion assay
Organotypic assays were conducted as described previously
(29). Brieﬂy, approximately 7.5  104/mL primary human
ﬁbroblasts were embedded in a 3D matrix of rat tail collagen
I. Rat tail tendon collagen was prepared by extraction with 0.5
mol/L acetic acid to a concentration of approximately 2 mg/mL.

Detached, polymerized matrix (2.5 mL) in 35-mm Petri dishes
was allowed to contract for 6 to 8 days in complete media
(DMEM, supplemented with 10% FCS; Invitrogen) until the
ﬁbroblasts had contracted the matrix to 1.5 cm diameter.
Subsequently, 4  104 Src biosensor-expressing PDAC cells
were plated on top of the matrix in complete media and allowed
to grow to conﬂuence for 4 to 5 days. The matrix was then
mounted on a metal grid and raised to the air–liquid interface
resulting in the matrix being fed from below with complete
media that was changed every 2 days. After 6 to 8 days invasion,
the cultures were imaged as described or ﬁxed using 4%
paraformaldehyde and processed for hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining. For drug treatment, 100 nmol/L of dasatinib
(Bristol-Myers Squibb) was added to the media below the
matrix during the 6- to 8-day period as described. For cyclopamine treatment, 2.5 to 10 mmol/L was added directly after
matrix detachment before contraction (30, 31). Representative
images of at least 3 independent experiments are shown, total of
985 cells assessed by FLIM-FRET. Columns, mean; error bars,
SE; P value by unpaired Student t test.
Drug treatment in vitro and in vivo
Dasatinib (a kind gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb) was
administered daily by oral gavage in 80 mmol/L citrate buffer
(10 mg/kg) or 100 nmol/L in vitro (19, 25, 32). Cyclopamine (LC
Laboratories) was administered by oral gavage (25 mg/kg; 33)
or 2.5 to 10 mmol/L in vitro. PP1 (Sigma-Aldrich; 10 mmol/L) and
EGF (R&D Systems; 50 ng/mL) was used in vitro.
Collagen organization measurements using gray-level
co-occurrence matrix analysis
Using ImageJ, summed intensity projections were formed
from raw 16-bit TIFF z-stacks of the collagen second harmonic
generation (SHG) data. Three 100 mm  100 mm regions of
interest were selected to assess the collagen present. These
subregions were saved for analysis using an in-house modiﬁed
version of the UMB gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)
features plug-in (http://arken.umb.no/~kkvaal/eamtexplorer/
imagej_plugins.html). The modiﬁcations made allow for
looped operation of the plug-in for a user-deﬁned number of
neighbor index points and for 0 , 90 , 180 , and 270 directions
of comparison. This allows for the calculation of the average
texture parameters for each image. The plug-in was sequentially applied to each 100 mm  100 mm region of interest. Once
all the images were analyzed, the normalized texture parameters (contrast, uniformity, correlation, homogeneity, and
entropy) were calculated for each images and imported into
GraphPad Prism (version 5.00 for Mac OS X, GraphPad Software; www.graphpad.com). The mean parameters were plotted
(averaging over all four directions) along with the SEM against
the neighbor index. Data are shown as points and dashed lines
represent the nonlinear biexponential ﬁt to each dataset (34).

Results
Generation of a FLIM-FRET–based genetic model of
pancreatic cancer
To study the dynamic regulation of Src activity in pancreatic
cancer in vivo, we ﬁrst established primary PDAC cells from the

4676

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

KPC mouse model (14). Using these primary PDAC cells, we
generated stable cells expressing a ECFP-YPet variant of the
Src-FRET biosensor (28). The biosensor is composed of ECFP,
an SH2 domain, a ﬂexible linker and a Src substrate peptide
derived from the c-Src substrate p130cas, linked to YPet (Fig.
1A). When the substrate is unphosphorylated the biosensor
adopts a compact conformation in which the ﬂuorophores are
in close proximity, resulting in high FRET efﬁciency. Upon Srcinduced phosphorylation, the substrate peptide binds to the
SH2 domain and separates YPet from ECFP, thereby decreasing FRET (Fig. 1A; ref. 28). The loss of FRET upon Src activation
is consistent with the intramolecular interaction of the phosphorylated substrate with the SH2 domain, and the subsequent
change in FRET efﬁciency can be measured using ﬂuorescent
lifetime imaging of the donor ﬂuorophore, ECFP (Fig. 1A and
B). In the lifetime color maps, low basal Src activity is represented as blue, whereas high Src activity is represented as
warm red/yellow colors, and areas with low signal-to-noise
ratio in which lifetime measurements cannot be achieved are
black (Fig. 1B). A critical advantage of this approach is that the
biosensor allows us to visualize the dynamic and reversible
equilibrium of Src activity within single cells in real-time. The
resulting PDACs expressing the Src biosensor therefore serve
as an excellent genetic and ﬂuorescent model system to
quantify the spatial and temporal regulation of Src activity in
pancreatic cancer (Fig. 1A and B; refs. 11–13).
Application of the Src biosensor to investigate drug
targeting
To establish whether FLIM-FRET analysis of the Src biosensor could be used to rapidly and accurately distinguish
subtle changes in Src activity in response to therapeutic
intervention, PDAC cells were subjected to dasatinib treatment
in culture. Cells were treated with 100 nmol/L of dasatinib, a
dose previously shown to be biologically effective in the KPC
model (25) and the activity of Src within individual cells was
determined using FLIM-FRET. Following 120 seconds of FLIM
acquisition, a distribution of ﬂuorescent lifetimes was
obtained, where a peak in lifetime within control cells was
evident between 2.4 and 2.5 nanoseconds (Fig. 1C, gray).
Dasatinib treatment induced a shift in this lifetime distribution, yielding a lower peak of 2.2 to 2.3 nanoseconds (Fig. 1C,
pink and overlay, red). Using this shift in lifetime distribution
peaks, we stratiﬁed these readouts and used a cutoff of > 2.35
nanoseconds to classify cells as "active," whereas lifetimes of <
2.35 nanoseconds were classed as "inactive" (Fig. 1C and D and
Supplementary Fig. S1). This enabled us to analyze the status of
individual cells with respect to features of their environment,
and capture behavior that would be masked by average measurements of ﬂuorescence within a ﬁeld of cells. We next
conducted rapid pharmacodynamic measurements of dasatinib efﬁcacy in PDAC cells by generating a single cell, FLIMFRET-based, dose–response curve (Fig. 2A) supported by
standard Western blotting (Fig. 2B). The ability to monitor
Src activity on a single cell basis and the fast acquisition
provided by multiphoton-based FLIM (19) shows the advantage and potential application of this technique as a dynamic,
single cell biomarker for drug-targeting studies.

Temporal monitoring of drug targeting using a FRET
biosensor
To determine whether the Src biosensor could be used to
monitor ﬂuctuations in target activity and drug clearance in a
time-dependent manner, we carried out an in vitro washout
experiment in which PDAC cells were subjected to 100 nmol/L
dasatinib for 30 minutes, and subsequently monitored Src
activity in response to dasatinib withdrawal using FLIM-FRET
over 6 hours. The efﬁcacy of dasatinib treatment was shown by
a signiﬁcant decrease in the fraction of Src-active cells upon
dasatinib treatment (Fig. 2C; decreasing from 54.8%  3.7% to
35.7%  6.9%). Following washout, a rapid recovery in the

www.aacrjournals.org

fraction of Src-active cells was observed after 1 hour, which
peaked at 3 hours (P ¼ 0.014) and subsequently returned
toward control levels within 6 hours (Fig. 2C). The capacity
to track Src activity overtime in vitro prompted us to gauge
whether we could use this approach to investigate temporal
drug targeting and clearance under more functional and
physiologic conditions in live animal tumors.

solid tumor tissue, providing a powerful tool to directly examine cancer progression in situ (19). This allowed us to readily
investigate cells surrounded by ECM, stroma, and vasculature
in a live setting upon drug treatment. Here, we subcutaneously
injected mice with primary PDAC cells, and once tumors were
established, subjected these mice to daily oral gavage of 10 mg/
kg of dasatinib for 3 days (Fig. 3A). Inactivation of Src activity
was evident under these conditions, as previously described
(19, 25, 32). After the ﬁnal administration of dasatinib, Src
activity was subsequently monitored using FLIM-FRET at time
points of 1 to 2, 4 to 6, 16, and 24 hours posttreatment (see
imaging regimen Fig. 3A). After the ﬁnal dose of dasatinib, a
rapid recovery of Src activity was observed, reaching a maximum at 16 hours postdrug treatment before returning to
control levels within 24 hours (Fig. 3B–D; quantiﬁed in (Fig. 3E;
P ¼ 0.021). The rapid recovery of Src activity to control levels
as early as 4 to 6 hours post-dasatinib (Fig. 3E) could potentially

4678

explain the partially ineffective targeting of pancreatic tumors
we previously observed after a single daily oral dose of 10 mg/kg
in dasatinib-treated KPC mice, which resulted in a reduction of
metastasis of approximately 50% (25). Our FLIM-FRET analysis
suggests that treating mice more frequently to counteract this
early recovery may warrant future investigation in this genetically engineered mouse model (25).
Spatial regulation of Src activity in tumor
subpopulations in 3D
The in vivo ﬂuorescent lifetime assessment of the Src
biosensor (Fig. 3) represents single cell measurements taken
from cells located throughout the tumor mass. The activity
of proteins involved in cancer progression can, however, also
be locally regulated by different environmental cues within
tumor cell subpopulations such as areas of invasive borders
or within hotspots in the tumor microenvironment. By

adapting in vitro optical techniques, such as ﬂuorescence
recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) or photoactivation
(PA) to in vivo applications, we have previously shown
context-dependent differences in protein behavior governed
by local signals during cancer progression in vivo (32, 35). We
therefore sought to determine whether FLIM-FRET could be
used to monitor response to drug treatment in spatially
distinct tumor subpopulations.
Complex 3D matrices such as organotypic assays have been
used to mimic cell–ECM interactions in vivo (30, 36, 37). They
offer a source of growth factors and appropriate integrin
engagement, resulting in bidirectional signaling between
tumor cells and the surrounding stromal ﬁbroblasts during
invasion (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). We
therefore used organotypic matrices as previously described
(29, 38, 39) to provide a controlled platform for assessment of

www.aacrjournals.org

Src activity in invading tumor cells before in vivo analysis.
Organotypic matrices consisting of human ﬁbroblasts and rat
tail ﬁbrillar collagen I were established, which when exposed
to an air–liquid interface induce a chemotactic gradient that
allows overlayed PDAC cells to invade over time (Fig. 4A).
Consistent with our recent in vitro and in vivo data
(14, 19, 20, 25), KPC-derived PDACs expressing the Src reporter
invaded into the matrix within 8 days (Fig. 4B). To investigate
Src activity during different stages of invasion, we measured
activity at 20 mm intervals up to 120 mm within the matrix (Fig.
4C and D). Interestingly, the fraction of active Src cells
increased in proportion to the depth invaded (Fig. 4D). This
spatially distinct gradient of Src activity within invading tumor
cell subpopulations, suggests that in a 3D context, a switch in
Src activity may be regulated by cues from within the local
microenvironment during invasion.

Next, we assessed the response to dasatinib treatment of
tumor subpopulations in the upper section of the organotypic
matrix (0–40 mm) compared with those at depth (60–120 mm).
Cells were allowed to invade for 6 days followed by dasatinib
treatment for the last 2 days. The fraction of active Src cells in
the upper section did not signiﬁcantly change upon dasatinib
treatment, whereas the fraction of active Src cells at depth was
signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 4E). This also correlated with a
reduction in invasion after treatment (Fig. 4B; Supplementary
Fig. S2; refs. 19, 25). It is therefore possible to use FLIM-FRET to

tumor cells and gauge context- and site-speciﬁc drug-targeting

investigated Src activity in distinct regions within living solid
tumors.

invasive borders, whereas cells in which p53 is deleted, form
noninvasive, encapsulated tumors (19). To identify distinct
tumor regions, we used features of the tissue stroma visualized
using SHG imaging. Central regions of the tumor were characterized by anisoptropic distribution of collagen ﬁbers,
whereas border regions were readily identiﬁed by isotropic
organization as previously described (34). GLCM analysis was
used to distinguish between the tumor center and border
based on features of the SHG collagen image (Supplementary
Fig. S3; ref. 34). In line with our results using organotypic
matrices (Fig. 4), we observed that Src activity correlated
with regions of invasion in mutant p53 PDACs in vivo (Fig. 5).
In control-treated PDAC tumors, cells within the tumor core
were found to be predominantly inactive (Fig. 5A and C),
whereas cells within invasive borders were predominantly
active (Fig. 5B and C). Upon dasatinib treatment, the fraction
of active Src cells within the tumor center did not signiﬁcantly change (26.6%  15.7% vs. 25.2%  1.8% of active
cells). However, at the invasive border, a switch from a
predominantly active to inactive state was observed
(55.2%  5.7% vs. 40.4%  2.7%). These results show that

ulation and that FLIM-FRET can potentially be used to map
areas of drug-targeting efﬁciency.
Drug delivery and targeting efﬁcacy in live tumors is
governed by proximity to vasculature
Poor vasculature or limited drug perfusion to tumor tissue
is thought to play a critical role in drug delivery and efﬁcacy
(27). Because tumor cells that are located in areas of poor
drug exposure may recolonize or subsequently repopulate to
form micro-metastases following treatment, it would be beneﬁcial to identify regions of poor drug delivery within various
solid tumor environments using FLIM-FRET. Next, we determined whether single cell analysis of Src activity could be used
to assess the targeting of dasatinib with respect to the host
vasculature.
Mice bearing primary PDAC tumors were generated as
before and treated with 10 mg/kg of dasatinib for 3 days (Fig.
3A). Before FLIM-FRET imaging, quantum dots (Qtracker-655)
were intravenously injected to act as a contrast agent to
identify tumor vasculature (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Movie
S3). This enabled us to analyze Src activity within four key
zones: 0–25, 25–50, 50–100, and >100 mm from vasculature.
Using this approach, we found that a spatial distribution of Src

activity exists in this context, in line with previous results (Figs.
4 and 5). Src activity increased in proportion to the distance
from blood supply (Fig. 6C, control) and using FLIM-FRET
analysis we could accurately measure the response to dasatinib
treatment in this spatial setting. Src activity in cells proximal to
blood supply (0–25 mm) was readily reduced in response to
dasatinib, resulting in the predominant form of Src in cells
being converted from an active to inactive state (Fig. 6C; < 25
mm  dasatinib). A similar effect was observed within 25–50
mm from vasculature (Fig. 6C; 25–50 mm  dasatinib), reaching
a limiting threshold at 50–100 mm from the vasculature (Fig.
6C; 50–100 mm  dasatinib). Critically, PDAC cells beyond 100
mm from vasculature were inefﬁciently targeted, such that
dasatinib treatment increased the inactive pool by 15.6%
compared with control-treated mice, but the predominant

4682

pool of cells remained in an active state (Fig. 6C; >100 mm
 dasatinib). Using this approach, we can therefore measure
the limitations of drug targeting in vivo and pinpoint areas (Fig.
5) or thresholds (Fig. 6) of nontargeting and poor drug delivery
in live tumor tissue. Applying this target validation technology
with combination therapy aimed at improving drug delivery,
we could potentially document site-speciﬁc and time-dependent improvements in response to new therapeutic regimens.

Imaging Drug Targeting in Live Tumors

in pancreatic cancer has been an active area of research (8–
10, 40, 41). In the KPC mouse described here, therapy to deplete
the tumor-associated ECM using the hedgehog signaling inhibitor IP-926 increased tumor perfusion and the therapeutic
index of chemotherapeutic agents within the pancreas, and
increased the overall survival in these mice when used in
combination with chemotherapy (10). Moreover, the enzymatic depletion of the abundant ECM component, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (31), by PEGPH20 has recently been shown
to improve the intratumor delivery of chemotherapeutic
agents in vivo (8, 9). These studies, in part, suggest that the
current therapeutic failure of agents in the treatment of
pancreatic cancer may arise from a potentially reversible
impairment in tumor drug delivery. Combination therapy to
disrupt the deposition of ECM and sensitize tumors before
treatment may improve the current efﬁcacy of dasatinib in this
disease (8–10, 42). As proof-of-principle, we investigated
whether targeting the tumor ECM using the hedgehog signaling inhibitor cyclopamine (33) before dasatinib treatment
could improve drug delivery within the tumor tissue and
examined whether FLIM-FRET could be used as a tool to
accurately quantify and monitor the limitations of this process.
To assess whether cyclopamine treatment reduces ECM
content (10), we initially subjected organotypic matrices to
cyclopamine treatment during matrix formation. Treatment
with cyclopamine led to a dose-dependent reduction in stromal ﬁbroblast-driven collagen I contraction (Fig. 7A and B).
Moreover, the ﬁbrillar and cross-linked collagen I content in
organotypic matrices was signiﬁcantly reduced as quantiﬁed
by SHG imaging [as previously described (43)] and GLCM (34)
analysis, respectively (Fig. 7C and D; Supplementary Fig. S4 and
Supplementary Movies S4 and S5). Next, we assessed whether
cyclopamine alone had any effect on Src activity within PDAC
cells in vitro. Following cyclopamine treatment ranging from
2.5 to 20 mmol/L, Src activity was unaffected as determined by
FLIM-FRET and Western blotting (Fig. 7E and F).
To assess the effects of cyclopamine in vivo, mice were
injected subcutaneously with primary PDAC cells, and the
tumors were allowed to form before treatment with cylopamine alone for 3 days by oral gavage. Cyclopamine targeting of
the stroma and ECM normalized the tumor microenvironment
in vivo resulting in a loss of the spatial distribution of Src
activity observed in relation to the vasculature (compare Figs.
7G with 6C, control). As cyclopamine treatment alone had no
effect on Src activity in tumor cell in vitro (Fig. 7E and F), this
suggests that targeting the tumor stroma in vivo can affect the
activity of tumor cells indirectly via targeting environmental
cues from the host surroundings such as ECM components.
Combination therapy using cyclopamine pretreatment and
dasatinib was then examined and target inhibition within three
key zones from tumor vasculature (25–50, 50–100, and >100
mm) was determined. At 25–50 mm from vasculature, there was
a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of cells that switched to
a predominantly inactive state upon cyclopamine þ dasatinib
treatment compared with dasatinib alone (compare Fig. 6C
dasatinib alone with Fig. 7H þ cyclopamine; 25–50 mm). A
small, though not signiﬁcant improvement in drug targeting in
cells at 50–100 mm was also observed upon cylopamine pre-

treatment [compare Fig. 6C dasatinib alone with Fig. 7H þ
cyclopamine; 50–100 mm (inactive 59.05%  12.35% (SEM) vs.
64.97%  16.51% (SEM), respectively, P ¼ 0.407)]. Importantly,
the effect of cyclopamine þ dasatinib at 100 mm from the
vasculature was equivalent to cyclopamine alone at this distance (compare Fig. 7G to Fig. 7H). Thus, indicating that we
have reached the limitation of this combination therapy as no
further improvement in drug efﬁcacy at this distance can be
achieved using this combination. As cyclopamine was shown
to have no direct effect on Src activity in tumor cells alone (Fig.
7E and F), this suggests that indirectly targeting the tumor
architecture can affect Src activity within tumor cells. The
capacity to monitor spatial regulation of protein species using
FLIM-FRET technology can therefore be used as a tool to
determine the boundaries of combination therapy and allow
for improved targeting and therapeutic outcome in preclinical
models within the limitations of the tissue microenvironment
of interest.

Discussion
To improve upon the current high attrition rates and latestage failure in drug development, more innovative and informative approaches to candidate drug selection and clinical
design are required (44). Failure to translate drug candidates
into clinical beneﬁt suggest that conventional early drug
discovery strategies and preclinical models are suboptimal
and may poorly predict the heterogeneous drug response to
effectively guide clinical dosing or combination strategies (45).
Here, we show the use of FLIM-FRET in the preclinical
analysis of a dynamic biomarker in vivo during the assessment
of therapeutic drug treatment. Detailed topologic analysis at
cellular and subcellular resolution in live tumor tissue has
enabled precise detection and single cell quantiﬁcation of
subtle changes in protein activity over time that cannot
faithfully be achieved using standard ﬁxed endpoint
approaches applied to in vitro cultured models or ex vivo
immunohistochemical analysis (2, 44). Using a genetically
engineered model of pancreatic cancer that recapitulates the
human disease and a novel therapeutic with shown activity in
pancreatic cancer, we have quantiﬁed the improvement in
drug response associated with combination therapy and illustrate the application and advantages of FLIM-FRET in the drug
target validation process. The distinct spatial- and environment-based regulation of Src observed here increases the
possibility that other cancer types may harbor inefﬁciently
targeted regions governed by unique microenvironments
found within the local tumor tissue. Combination of preclinical
mouse models with the rapidly expanding portfolio of new
FRET-based biosensors (46–49) could prove useful for assessing the response to therapy of a wide variety of potential drug
targets. Furthermore, intravital FLIM-FRET imaging could
provide a pixel-by-pixel map of protein activity in response
to drug targeting in other forms of cancer or disease states.
Advances in systems biology approaches to drug discovery
consider the complexity of disease and offer alternative strategies for target selection, validation, and drug proﬁling (44, 45).
In the ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging ﬁeld, advances have led to

high-speed FLIM being developed to monitor protein activity
or protein–protein interactions in vitro in a format suitable for
high-content chemical or molecular screening (44, 50). Both
time domain- or frequency domain–based FLIM have been
adapted to allow for fast FLIM in a 96-well high-throughput
platform and as such have permitted a multiplexed FRETreadout of distinct and independent protein species that can
be temporally and spatially resolved in vitro (51, 52). This, along
with recent work using FLIM to identify tyrosine phosphorylation networks in response to EGFR signaling in a highthroughput setting (53), highlights the potential application
of FLIM for resolving transient compensatory and adaptive
signaling events in response to a variety of drug treatment
regimens. Early use of FLIM-FRET imaging to intermediate 3D
and in vivo setting, as described here, may reveal further layers
and context-dependent detail about drug response not feasible
in vitro (54).
Finally, the dynamic tumor analysis described here can be
applied to other strategies aimed at altering drug delivery, such
as approaches to enhance the vascular patency of blood vessels
before treatment to increase perfusion within the tumor tissue
(8, 9). The transient normalization of tumor vessels in response
to short-term antiangiogenic agents has also been shown to
temporarily enhance drug delivery to tumors (55). There is
therefore a clear limit to how much we can alter the ECM or
blood supply, such that we do not compromise the integrity
and structure of the organ/tissue of interest. Use of this
imaging technology with combination therapy may help determine the appropriate therapeutic window for altering the
equilibrium between the tumor tissue and microenvironment,
while maintaining maximum drug delivery (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Finally, the intravital imaging approach applied in this
study to assess protein behavior can also be applied in other

biologic frameworks where heterogeneity may determine therapeutic response, thereby assisting in the design, scheduling,
and streamlining of efﬁcient drug delivery in a wide variety of
disease conditions.
