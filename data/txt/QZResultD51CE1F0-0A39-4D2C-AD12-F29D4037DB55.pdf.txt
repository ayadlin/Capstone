ABSTRACT:
Mutations of the p53 gene hallmark many human cancers. Several p53 mutant
proteins acquire the capability to promote cancer progression and metastasis, a
phenomenon defined as Gain of Oncogenic Function (GOF). The downstream targets
by which GOF p53 mutants perturb cellular programs relevant to oncogenesis
are only partially known. We have previously demonstrated that SLC25A1 (CIC)
promotes tumorigenesis, while its inhibition blunts tumor growth. We now report
that CIC is a direct transcriptional target of several p53 mutants. We identify a novel
interaction between mutant p53 (mutp53) and the transcription factor FOXO-1 which
is responsible for regulation of CIC expression levels. Tumor cells harboring mutp53
display higher CIC levels relative to p53 null or wild-type tumors, and inhibition of
CIC activity blunts mutp53-driven tumor growth, partially overcoming GOF activity. 
CIC inhibition also enhances the chemotherapeutic potential of platinum-based
agents. Finally, we found that elevated CIC levels predict poor survival outcome
in tumors hallmarked by high frequency of p53 mutations. Our results identify CIC
as a novel target of mutp53 and imply that the employment of CIC inhibitors may
improve survival rates and reduce chemo-resistance in tumors harboring these types
of mutations, which are among the most intractable forms of cancers.

INTRODUCTION

of the p53 allele in the absence of a wild-type allele is
often maintained even in genomic unstable, advanced
forms of neoplasias [2,3].
The contribution of GOF mutants to tumorigenesis
is illustrated by paradigmatic studies that have been
conducted in mice and humans. Unlike p53 null animals
that mainly develop soft tissue and hematopoietic tumors,
mice expressing the “hot spot” p53 mutant proteins,
p53R172H, p53R270H or p53R248W, display accelerated
tumor onset and develop carcinomas in multiple tissues
[4-8]. Furthermore, patients affected by Li-Fraumeni
syndrome carrying germ-line p53 GOF mutations develop
more aggressive tumors and at an earlier age compared

In normal cells the p53 tumor suppressor restrains
proliferation mostly by implementing a complex
transcriptional network that in turn, promotes growth
arrest, apoptosis or senescence in response to various
forms of stress [1]. Missense mutations within the p53
gene occur with high frequency in human tumors and are
predominantly clustered within the DNA binding domain
leading to loss of normal wild-type activity. However, it
is emerging that p53 mutants also Gain novel Oncogenic
Functions (GOF), thus explaining why one mutated copy

to patients lacking p53 or harboring loss of function
mutations [7]. The downstream targets that mediate this
pro-oncogenic activity of p53 mutants are complex and
are only partially defined. It has been shown that the
interaction of mutp53 with various transcription factors
can positively or negatively regulate the expression of
numerous target genes, in turn perturbing biological
programs relevant to oncogenesis [3]. For example, the
interaction of mutp53 with SREBP-1 or with NF-Y leads
to alterations of the metabolism or of cell cycle check­
points, respectively [9,10].
The mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1,
also known as CIC or CTP, belongs to a family of
proteins embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane
and promotes the efflux of tricarboxylic citrate to the
cytoplasm in exchange for dicarboxylic cytosolic malate
[11-13]. Our previous work demonstrated that CIC
expression is high in several tumor types and that its
genetic or chemical inhibition has anti-tumor activity [14].
The relevance of CIC in cancer is further underlined by
recent observations demonstrating that the transcription
rates of the CIC promoter are positively regulated by key
oncogenic molecules, specifically by PGC1α, by NKF-kappa-B and by inflammatory signals [15, 16].
Furthermore, CIC is also induced by Hepatitis C Virus, a
major etiopathogenic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma
[17].
In this work we asked whether regulation of CIC

plays a role in mutp53 GOF activity, and we explored the
molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between
CIC and mutp53 as well as the functional consequences
of CIC inhibition in p53 mutant tumors. Our results
demonstrate that several p53 mutants are directly recruited
to the CIC promoter via a newly identified interaction with
the transcription factor FOXO-1, resulting in induction of
CIC transcription. Our studies identify CIC as a novel
target of mutant, but not wild-type p53, thus offering
new insights for understanding how p53 mutant proteins
acquire oncogenic activity. Further, our results strongly
argue that the inhibition of CIC may improve survival
rates and chemo-resistance in tumors harboring p53
mutations.

RESULTS
Identification of CIC as a gene product regulated
by several p53 mutants.
CIC was originally identified in micro-array
platforms performed on the p53 null H1299 lung cancer
cell line, expressing the “hot spot” mutant p53R175H
or p53G245A. The analysis of existing databases,
specifically either the geoprofiles [18,19] or Oncomine
[20], further revealed that high CIC levels correlate with

the expression of p53 mutations in several cancer cell
lines or human tumors. Data extracted from the geoprofile
database demonstrated that down-regulation of p53 with
a specific shRNA in the breast cancer cell line MDA-468
that expresses p53R273H (MDA-468.shp53, [9]), reduces
the CIC mRNA (Figure 1A). CIC expression is high in
patient-derived osteosarcomas expressing some, but not all
p53 mutations (Figure 1B). A similar association between
p53 mutations and high CIC levels was confirmed by
interrogating the cBioPortal database for cancer genomics
[21,22] (Supplemental Figure S1).
To then determine whether wild-type or mutant p53
can regulate CIC at a transcriptional level, we performed
luciferase assays using a vector containing the CIC
promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase gene (PGL3CIC) [23]. We found that while wild-type p53 repressed
CIC promoter activity, p53R175H stimulated the CIC
promoter in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 1C). Two
additional mutants, namely p53G281D and p53G245A
were similarly able to activate the CIC reporter,
although to different extents (Figure 1D). Furthermore,
by employing reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) we determined that both p53G281D
and p53G245A enhanced CIC mRNA levels (Figure 1E),

indicating that regulation of CIC occurs at a transcriptional
level. To further substantiate our findings we also
compared the expression levels of the CIC mRNA in
tumors harboring p53 mutations, relative to the expression
of other known, well validated targets of mutp53,
specifically, cyclin A1 (CCN1) and cdk1 [10], as well
as 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A Reductase
(HMGCR) and Mevalonate (Diphospho- Decarboxylase
(MVD) [9]. As shown in Figure S2, the expression levels
of CIC are found elevated in p53 mutant tumors with a
frequency similar, if not greater, to those of these well
validated targets.
We next sought to confirm that p53 mutants increase
the levels of CIC protein. The expression of p53R175H,
p53G281D or p53G245A in the p53 null H1299 cell lines
increased the levels of endogenous CIC protein compared
to naive H1299 cells (Figure 2AB), while wild-type p53
did not (Figure 2A, lane 2). In isogenic murine mammary
breast cancer cell lines either lacking p53, harboring
a wild-type gene or carrying the p53G242A codon
(equivalent to the human G245A mutation) [24-26], high
CIC levels were seen in cells expressing mutant but not
wild-type p53 (Figure 2C). Additionally, down-regulation
of p53R280K or p53R273H in MDA-231 or MDA-468

p53shRNA [9,24] reduced the levels of endogenous CIC
(Figure 2DE). These data demonstrate that a subset of p53
mutants enhance CIC expression.

key role in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
(Figure 3A). Interestingly, the CIC promoter also contains
consensus sites for p53 as well, but given that wild-type
p53 was unable to stimulate CIC promoter activity, the
physiological relevance of these sites is currently unclear.
It is possible that these sites are employed by p53 family
members, p63 or p73. As previously shown by Infantino et
al., [23], expression of SREBP-1 strongly stimulated CIC
transcription and we further determined that also c-Myc
and FOXO-1 induced CIC promoter activity (Figure
3B). The structure of the CIC promoter thus provides
the potential for regulation of CIC expression levels by
various oncogenic and anti-oncogenic signal pathways.
Recent studies have shown that various p53 mutants
interact with SREBP-1 to induce the expression of
SREBP-1 regulated genes [9]. Therefore, we next explored
whether SREBP-1 influences the ability of mutant p53
to activate the CIC promoter. Surprisingly, both the
p53D281G (Figure 3C) and p53R175H (not shown)
mutants stimulated the transcription of the CIC promoter
construct that lacked the SREBP-1 binding site [23]
even more potently than the native promoter containing

CIC expression is regulated by a newly identified
interaction between mutant p53 and FOXO-1.
The molecular mechanisms by which p53 mutants
activate transcription are only partially clear, but in many
cases these proteins are directly recruited to various
promoters via the interaction with other transcription
factors [3]. To discriminate whether CIC is a direct or
indirect target of mutp53, we first conducted an in silico
analysis of the CIC promoter to detect transcription
factor binding sites using Genomatix MathInspector and
the LASAGNA search software (Figure 3A) [27]. In
addition to the previously identified SREBP-1 binding site
[23], these analyses revealed the presence of consensus
elements for Myc/Max, for FOXO-1, for HIF1-alpha as
well as for the transcription factor Twist, which plays a

this element (Figure 3C). In contrast, the expression of
a validated shRNA for FOXO-1, abrogated the ability of
p53D281G to stimulate CIC promoter activity (Figure
3D).
This result prompted us to interrogate the DNA
binding ability of mutant p53 with different regions of the
CIC promoter relative to the FOXO-1 binding sites. To
this end, we employed chromatin immuno-precipitation
assays (ChIP). There are several binding sites for FOXO
family members some of which partially overlap with
binding elements for other Forkhead transcription factors,
including Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha (HNF-3A,
or FOXA1 [28]), (Supplemental Figure S3). By dividing
the CIC promoter into 5 fragments each encompassing
approximately 300 base pairs, we found that that both
p53R175H and p53D281G interacted strongly with two
different regions of the CIC promoter (designated Binding
Site 2 and 3, or BS2 and BS3 in Figure 3A; Figure 4A,
lanes 4 and 11). To next determine whether mutant p53
is recruited to these sites through an interaction with
FOXO-1, we performed immuno-depletion experiments

followed by ChIP assays (strategy depicted in Figure 4B).
Cell extracts containing chromatin-bound proteins were
first subjected to an immuno-precipitation with either the
anti-p53 (lanes 5, 12) or anti-Foxo1 (lane 7,14) antibodies.
The supernatants derived from these reactions were then
re-immuno-precipitated with the anti-FOXO or anti-p53
antibodies and subjected to PCR assays. As shown in
Figure 4A depletion of FOXO-1, impaired the occupancy
of both the p53R175H and the p53D281G proteins on
the CIC promoter (compare lanes 4 and 11 with lanes 7
and 14, respectively) and, conversely, depletion of p53
compromised FOXO-1 binding (compare lanes 6 and
13 with lanes 5 and 12). Furthermore, although neither
of these mutants affected FOXO-1 expression levels,
FOXO-1 could be detected in soluble complexes with
either p53R175H or p53D281G in immuno-precipitation
experiments (Figure 4CD). Importantly, other mutants,
including p53G245A and p53R280K similarly bound to
the CIC promoter (Figure 4E). Taken together with the
luciferase assays shown in Figure 3D, these results thus
identify a novel interaction of p53 mutants with the

Figure 4: A. Chromatin immuno-precipitation assays performed on the Binding Site 2 and 3 of the CIC promoter. The procedure for the

immuno-depletion is schematically illustrated in B. Cell extracts were subjected to a first immuno-precipitation with the anti-p53 or antiFOXO-1 antibody, and the supernatant of these reactions was used for the reciprocal ChIP with the anti-FOXO-1 or anti-p53 antibodies,
respectively. In panel A cells expressing p53R175H or p53D281G were immuno-precipitated with antibodies directed against acetylated
histone H4 (lanes 2 and 9), or with IgG control (lanes 3,10), or with anti-p53 DO1 antibody (lanes 4,11), or anti-FOXO-1 antibody (lanes
6,13). The supernatant of the cell extracts subjected to the first immuno-precipitation with the anti-p53 or anti-FOXO antibodies were
then immuno-precipitated with the anti-FOXO-1 (lanes 7, 14), or anti-p53 (lanes 5 and 12) antibodies. Lane 1 contains input levels. C.

total extracts, probed for FOXO-1. D. In parallel experiments the levels of p53 (upper panel) or FOXO-1 were assessed in the cell lines
indicated at the top of the panel. E. ChIP assays were performed in cell extracts derived from cells expressing p53G245A (top panel), or

the induction of CIC transcription.

differing in CIC expression levels (indicated as CICFlag-1 and CIC-Flag-2, Figure 5AB). Over-expression
of CIC led to a modest, but statistically significant, dosedependent enhancement of proliferation rates (Figure 5A).
Conversely, the co-expression of two previously validated
CIC shRNAs [14], led to a reduction of CIC levels (Figure
5C) and hampered proliferation (Figure 5D). Two different
chemical inhibitors of CIC, BTA and 4-Chloro-3-[[(3nitrophenyl)amino]sulfonyl]-benzoic acid, CNFASB or
CTP-I [29], also dramatically reduced proliferation rates
(Figure 5E).
To next explore in further depth the effects of the
CIC protein on mutant p53 GOF properties, TOV cells or
the TOV cells over-expressing CIC, were infected with
either an adenovirus expressing the p53 shRNA or with
a control adenovirus, and cell proliferation was assessed
using colony forming assays. In naive TOV cells the p53
shRNA reduced colony forming ability, consistent with
the well-documented GOF properties of p53R175H [46]. However, colony forming rates were nearly entirely
rescued in the TOV cell line over-expressing CIC (Figure
5FG). Thus, these findings indicate that the proliferation
advantage conferred by mutant p53 relies at least in part,
upon CIC, as CIC over-expression overcomes the effects
of the p53 mutant knockdown.

CIC contributes to the gain of oncogenic function
of p53 mutants and its inhibition enhances chemosensitivity to cisplatin.
Many p53 mutants acquire neomorphic gain of
oncogenic function (GOF) activities, through which they
promote proliferation. Therefore, we next investigated
whether CIC promotes mutant p53 GOF. We previously
showed that inhibition of CIC with specific shRNAs
or with the specific CIC inhibitor compound benzenetricarboxylate (BTA), hampers the oncogenic potential
of MDA-231 cells, which express the GOF mutant
p53R280K [14]. We then expanded these experiments
to explore the effects of CIC in other cell lines harboring
p53 mutations. First, we used ovarian cancer cells TOV,
which express the hot spot p53R175H mutant, to construct
TOV derivative clones harboring the cDNA expressing
epitope-tagged Flag-CIC. After antibiotic selection,
multi-clonal cell populations were pooled together
and we studied the proliferation rates of two clones

Inhibition of CIC activity blunts mutant p53 GOF
activity in vivo.

One of the most challenging problems faced in
the treatment of ovarian cancer, as well as of other solid
tumors is the development of resistance to platinumderived agents, which are often used as first line
therapeutics. The presence of p53 mutations is a well
known contributor to drug resistance [30, 31]. Recent
genome-wide transcriptional analyses of tumors that are
either chemo-sensitive or chemo-resistant to platinum
or carboplatin treatment have identified specific genetic
signatures linked to chemo-resistance [32,33]. The
analysis of these data, extracted from the geoprofile
database, showed that carboplatin resistant tumors
derived from patients or from cell lines display increased
expression levels of CIC (Supplemental Figure S4A).
To then determine whether CIC affects the sensitivity
to platinum compounds, TOV cells were treated with
different doses of cisplatin in the presence or absence
of BTA. As anticipated, treatment with BTA displayed
a chemo-sensitizing effect (Figure S4B), leading to a
reduction of the IC50 of cisplatin from 150 nM to 37
nM. Since we have previously shown that systemic BTA
treatment is well tolerated, at least in the adult mouse [14],
the data imply that co-treatment with CIC inhibitors may
re-sensitize certain resistant tumors to cisplatin or may
permit achieving clinically effective tumor killing while
employing more tolerable, less toxic doses of cisplatin.

To further explore the relationship between mutant
p53 and CIC, we next employed a syngeneic system
for studying p53 function by using the previously
described p53-null lung cancer cells H1299, engineered
to express either p53D281G or p53G245A [24,25].
To test the hypothesis that CIC inhibition blunts the
oncogenic activity of mutant p53, we performed tumor
transplantation experiments in nude mice. As shown
in Figure 6A, and consistent with GOF activities, the
expression of p53G245A or p53D281G significantly
enhanced the tumorigenicity of H1299 cells (Figure 6A).
Treatment with BTA nearly completely abrogated tumor
formation in the p53-null H1299 background, as we have
previously shown [14]. In addition, BTA significantly
reduced tumor size in the case of both p53G245A and
p53D281G (Figure 6B-E). Importantly, tumors that arose
in BTA treated mice displayed not only a reduction in
size, but were also significantly hypo-vascular (Figure
6F), suggesting that CIC inhibition might interfere with
angiogenesis and/or with the tumor-stroma interaction.
It should be noticed that tumor inhibition induced by
BTA was more prominent in naive H1299-p53 nullderived tumors, relative to tumors harboring p53D281G
or p53G245A. In keeping with the higher CIC levels in
cells harboring p53 mutations compared to p53 null cells
(Figure 2), this results suggests that higher doses of BTA
may be needed to achieve complete CIC inhibition in p53

in lung adenocarcinomas as well (see [14] and Figure 8
below].
We next employed the Kaplan–Meier software (KMplotter) that has the capability to assess the effect of 22,277
genes on survival in 4,142 breast, 1,715 lung cancers and
1,464 ovarian cancers [34-36]. In the case of breast cancer,
the most significant negative correlation between high CIC
levels and survival rates was seen in Estrogen-Receptor
Negative (ER-) breast cancers (Figure 8A). In the case of
lung cancer, the ability of high expression levels of CIC
to predict survival was quite remarkable (Figure 8B).
First, the analysis of these datasets confirmed that a large
portion of patients affected by lung cancer displays high
CIC expression levels. Second, the overall survival of the
patients with high CIC levels was dramatically reduced,
compared to patients with low CIC expression. Given
that lung cancer and the occurrence of p53 mutations
are strongly associated with cigarette smoking, we next

Elevated CIC levels predict poor survival in lung
cancer.
To further extend the significance of our findings,
we analyzed available databases in order to correlate CIC
expression with clinically relevant parameters. We have
previously shown that elevated CIC expression levels
are detected in several tumor types and cancer cell lines
[14]. Our analysis of the CBioPortal database for cancer
genomics also demonstrated alterations in copy number
as well as mutations of the CIC gene in various tumors,
including lung, ovary, bladder and head and neck cancers
(Figure 7). Among the copy number alterations identified,
amplifications were more frequent relative to deletions.
Importantly, CIC is a validated amplified gene in lung
squamous cell carcinoma [http://igdb.nsclc.ibms.sinica.

evaluated the performance of CIC as a marker of survival
in smoker versus non-smoker patient populations. As
shown in Figure 8CD the expression levels of CIC
generated a negative prognostic stratification which was
much more significant in smokers than in non-smokers.
The implications of these analyses is that patients with low
CIC levels have a much higher probability to survive lung
cancer, with a remarkable overall difference in survival of
approximately 5 years.

from that elicited by the wild-type protein. Consistent
with this view, mutant but not wild-type p53 was able to
enhance the transcription of the CIC promoter. Moreover,
by interrogating available databases, we have found
that higher expression of the CIC mRNA is detected in
primary tumors harboring p53 mutations. This result is
consistent with our studies performed in cancer cells in
culture, where we found a strong correlation between
high CIC levels and the presence of mutant p53. Taken
together with results demonstrating that inhibition of CIC
blunts tumorigenesis in p53 mutant cancers, our study
indicates that CIC is an important component of the
program by which mutants of p53 gain oncogenic activity.
Importantly, in our experimental conditions wild-type p53
was unable to activate transcription of the CIC promoter,
while we consistently observed a modest but reproducible
transcriptional repression. Since CIC is highly expressed in
the adipose tissue where it likely regulates lipid synthesis,
our results are apparently consistent with previous reports
showing that the expression of other enzymes involved in
lipid synthesis and metabolism are repressed by wild-type
p53 [9, 39,40].
Our previous data demonstrated that CIC promotes
oncogenesis with complex molecular mechanisms.
An important activity of CIC consists in promoting the

DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate that CIC is an important
target for cancer therapy and provide a strong rationale
for the employment of its inhibitors for the treatment of
tumors harboring p53 mutations. Furthermore the data
establish a strong rationale for the assessment of CIC
expression in lung cancer, given that CIC appears to have
negative prognostic significance in these tumors.
The frequency of p53 mutations is particularly
high in lung, ovarian and triple receptor negative breast
cancers [31,37, 38], paralleling high expression levels of
CIC in these tumors [14]. There is evidence that mutp53
proteins acquire the capability to promote tumorigenesis

export of citrate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm.
Recent work has shown that various p53 mutants with
GOF properties stimulate sterol and lipid biosynthesis
and activate the mevalonate pathway, an activity through
which these mutants subvert the normal architecture of
the mammary gland [9]. Since cytoplasmic citrate is the
only source for sterol and fatty acid synthesis it is very
likely that CIC is involved in this activity of mutant p53.
De novo lipid synthesis has also been implicated in the
acquisition of an invasive and metastatic phenotype,
which is similarly promoted by certain p53 mutants
[3,9,41,]. Furthermore, our mechanistic studies showed
that alterations in mitochondrial activity and turnover are
primarily responsible for the anti-tumor effects of CIC
inhibitors [14]. Indeed, the molecular signatures of cells
where CIC activity is impaired consist of a reduction
of mitochondria mass, production of Reactive Oxygen
Species (ROS) and induction of mitochondrial autophagy,
also called mitophagy, which is in turn responsible for
loss of viability due to CIC inhibition [14]. Our data also
showed that CIC bypasses the glycolytic addiction of
tumors and promotes OXOPHOS and ATP production,
ultimately enacting survival in response to glucose
starvation or to mitochondrial respiration injury. These
two forms of stress essentially recapitulate nutritional and
oxidative stress signals that all ensuing tumors face and
must overcome due to the inadequacy and irregularity of
the vasculature. More recently, mitochondrial alterations
similar to those described by our group were reported in
patients harboring germ-line inactivating CIC mutations
[42,43]. Thus, it has now been proposed that CIC be
classified as a gene involved in mitochondrial diseases
[42,43]. In this respect it is important to note that while
it is very clear that wild-type p53 affects mitochondrial
function, respiratory activity and glycolysis [44,45],
it is currently unknown how p53 mutants affect these
activities and the cancer promoting metabolic program.
Therefore the finding that CIC is a transcriptional target of
at least some types of p53 mutants provides a potentially
important link between these proteins and the metabolism
of tumor cells. The clarification of how the mutp53CIC crosstalk influences these important activities will
be an object of future studies. An additional important
finding of this study consists in the contribution of the
transcription factor FOXO-1 to the ability of mutant p53
to regulate CIC transcription. Although the available data
indicate that FOXO-1 might function as an anti-oncogene,
this transcription factor plays a key role in metabolic
adaptation to starvation, in regulation of lipid catabolism
during stress as well as in autophagy [46,47]. Therefore,
it is attractive to speculate that the cross-talk of mutant
p53 with FOXO-1, and possibly other FOXO-1-dependent
transcriptional targets, might promote survival of p53
mutant cells in the nutrient and oxygen-deprived tumor
microenvironment. However, we cannot exclude that other
transcription factors or other members of the Forkhead
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

box family also contributes to mutp53-dependent
regulation of CIC transcription.
Viewed together our data indicate for the first time
that CIC is a relevant target of GOF mutp53 proteins,
demonstrate that assessment of CIC expression might
have clinical relevance for predicting survival of patients
harboring p53 mutant tumors and further, they imply that
the employment of CIC inhibitors may improve chemosensitivity.

METHODS
Cell lines and Reagents.
The TOV cell lines employed in this study were
obtained from the tissue culture core facility at LCCC and
the H1299 cells were obtained from ATCC. The H1299
constitutively expressing the p53D281 were a kind gift
from Dr. Prives and the cells expressing p53G245A
have been described previously [24,25]. The MDA231shp53 and MDA-468shp53 were obtained from Dr.
Jill Bargonetti and were described previously [9]. All the
cells were grown in Dulbecco’ s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, 25 mM glucose, with glutamine and pyruvate
from Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS). The CIC specific shRNA vectors were
purchased from Origene (#TG316728 and #TR316728,
untagged or GFP-tagged). The vectors expressing human
CIC untagged or Flag-Myc epitope tagged were also from
Origene (#SC120727 and RC200657, respectively). The
antibodies used in this study were as follows. The anti-CIC
antibody from Santa Cruz Biotech, # sc-86392 employed
at 1:1000 dilution in immuno-blot. The anti-p53 antibodies
were the FL393 (Santa Cruz) or the DO1 Ab (Santa Cruz
or Life Technologies). The FOXO-1 polyclonal antibody
and shRNA were from Santa Cruz.

Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation Assays.
These were performed as previously described.
Briefly, the cells were cross-linked with 1% (w/v)
formaldehyde-PBS solutions for 10 min at room
temperature, formaldehyde was then inactivated by the
addition of 125 mM glycine. Chromatin extracts were
sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with size of 300-800
bp and then they were immunoprecipitated overnight
with rotation using the anti-p53 antibody (DO1,Santacruz
Biotechnology) or the anti-Foxo1 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). On the following day, protein A/G
magnetic beads(Millipore) that had been previously
blocked with salmon sperm DNA were added to each
reaction to precipitate antibody-DNA-protein complexes.
The precipitated complexes were then separated using
magnetic separator to separate immuno-precipitated

Luciferase Assays.

complex and supernatant. The immuno-precipitated
complex was then washed and incubated at 62°C
overnight in parallel with ‘‘input’’ samples to reverse the
crosslinking of DNA. The DNA was then separated from
the complex using a magnetic separator (Invitrogen), the
DNA was purified using Qiagen-PCR purification kit
prior to its use in the PCR reaction. For the immunodepletion experiments the soup obtained after the ChIP
with the first Ab, was incubated with anti-FOXO-1 or
anti-p53 antibodies and subjected to a second ChIP. The
precipitated DNA was subjected to PCR reactions for 30–
35 cycles as previously described.

The full length CIC promoter cloned upstream of
the PGL-3 vector and its corresponding SREBP-1 mutant,
were previously described. One g of the luciferase reporter
was transfected as indicated in the Figure legend with a
Calcium Phosphate Protocol (Promega), together with the
indicated concentrations of the plasmids expressing wildtype or mutant p53. Luciferase activity was monitored 24
hours after with an available kit (Promega). Data from
duplicate or triplicate experiments were plotted in excel
spread sheet and analyzed.

Primers used for the ChIP assays.

Cellular proliferation and colony forming assays.

The primers used for amplification of Binding Sites
1 and 2 were as follows: BS2: CIC promoter forward: 5’ g
c C A g g t t c t c t g g c t g a c 3’; CIC promoter reverse:
5’ G c T G g a g T G a c a T G c t c c T T 3’. For BS3: CIC
promoter forward: 5’ A A t g g g a g g C A g g g a C A c
3’; CIC promoter reverse: 5’ c c a a g a g g c T G a g a g
t c c T T T 3’.

The proliferative capacity of cells was assessed by
plating cells in a duplicate or triplicate. Treatments were
applied as indicated in the Legend of the Figure and viable
or dead cells were measured after 48-72 hours with trypan
blue exclusion by emoploying the Countess®Automated
Cell Counter (Life Tech.), according to the manufacturer
instruction. For colony forming assays cells were plated
in either 6 or 10 cm tissue culture dishes at a concentration
of 500 or 1000/dish, respectively. Colony forming ability
was assessed 4-10 days. Colonies were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with a solution containing
0.5% crystal violet.

Immunoprecipitations and immunoblots.
Preparation of cell extracts and immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described
[14,24,25]. For assessment of total CIC levels cell
extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer [14], for immunoprecipitation experiments we used Buffer A (20%
Glycerol; 40 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9; 0.4 mM EDTA;
0.2% Tween 20; 100 mM KCl), supplemented with
protease inhibitors, 5 mM DTT or Betamercaptoethanol,
10 mM N-ethylmalemide (NEM), as well as with TSA
(500 μM). Protein extracts were combined with the
indicated antibodies, precipitated with immobilized
protein A beads (Pierce), and subjected to SDS-PAGE,
followed by transfering to PVDF membranes (Milipore).
Chemiluminescence was performed with the WestPico
system (Pierce).

Mice and tumors.
To produce tumor xenografts 5 × 106 cells were
resuspended in PBS and injected subcutaneously in the
flanks of nude mice (Taconics). Mice were randomized
to receive either PBS or a PBS solution of BTA at a
concentration 26 mg/kg which was administered via
intra-peritoneal route three times a week. Mice were
pre-treated twice prior to the inoculation of tumor cell
lines. Once detectable tumors started to form, their size
was measured with a caliper in three dimensions. Serial
measurements were made at two-three day intervals after
the identification of the initial cellular mass to determine
growth curves in vivo. Tumor volumes were calculated
using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid VT = π/6 · L ·
W · D, where L is length, W is width, and D is depth.
All animal studies were approved by the Georgetown
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR).
For detection of CIC mRNA, total RNA was
extracted from cells using a commercially available
kit (Quiagen), followed by Reverse transcriptase PCR
(SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system, Invitrogen),
which was performed with random hexamer primers and
2 mg of RNA to obtain sufficient cDNA for analysis. The
primers were: forward 5’Catcgagatctgcatcacct3’; reverse:
5’Caaccccaacaagcccatgaa3’.
