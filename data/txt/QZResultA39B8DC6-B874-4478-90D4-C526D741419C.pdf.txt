Abstract
Melanoma is one of the cancers of fastest-rising incidence in the world. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is
overexpressed in melanoma and other cancers, and previous data suggest that iNOS and nitric oxide (NO) drive
survival and proliferation of human melanoma cells. However, speciﬁc mechanisms through which this occurs are
poorly deﬁned. One candidate is the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, which plays a major role in proliferation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis of melanoma and other cancers. We used the chick embryo chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) assay to test the hypothesis that melanoma growth is regulated by iNOS-dependent mTOR
pathway activation. Both pharmacologic inhibition and siRNA-mediated gene silencing of iNOS suppressed
melanoma proliferation and in vivo growth on the CAM in human melanoma models. This was associated with
strong downregulation of mTOR pathway activation by Western blot analysis of p-mTOR, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase
(p-P70S6K), p-S6RP, and p-4EBP1. iNOS expression and NO were associated with reversible nitrosylation of
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 2, and inhibited dimerization of TSC2 with its inhibitory partner TSC1,
enhancing GTPase activity of its target Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), a critical activator of mTOR
signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens from stage III melanoma patients showed a
signiﬁcant correlation between iNOS expression levels and expression of the mTOR pathway members.
Exogenously supplied NO was also sufﬁcient to reverse the mTOR pathway inhibition by the B-Raf inhibitor
vemurafenib. In summary, covalent modiﬁcation of TSC2 by iNOS-derived NO is associated with impaired TSC2/
TSC1 dimerization, mTOR pathway activation, and proliferation of human melanoma. This model is consistent
with the known association of iNOS overexpression and poor prognosis in melanoma and other cancers. Cancer

Introduction
Melanoma incidence is increasing rapidly, and although
surgical removal of early-stage disease is often curative, the
mean survival time following metastasis is rarely beyond one
year due to chemotherapeutically resistant disease (1). Thus, it
is critical to identify new molecular targets for melanoma
therapy.

Inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) is constitutively
overexpressed in many cancers, including melanoma and
gastric (2), breast (3), and head and neck (4) carcinomas. In
melanoma, iNOS expression correlates strongly with poor
clinical outcome (5, 6). On balance, preclinical data support
a protumor role for iNOS/NO (7) by a variety of mechanisms
(8–10). In both in vitro and in vivo models, iNOS and NO have
been variously shown to enhance carcinogenesis and tumor
progression, stimulate angiogenesis, support tumor growth,
and promote metastasis (11, 12). Thus, there is substantial
interest in the molecular mechanisms through which iNOS and
NO enhance tumor growth and aggressive behavior.
The PI3K–AKT–mTOR oncogenic signaling pathway (13) is
one potential target of iNOS/NO. mTOR is activated by the
small GTPase Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb; refs. 14,
15), which is the target of the GTPase-activating domain of the
tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) protein. TSC2 is a tumor
suppressor gene, which, when complexed with TSC1, inactivates Rheb and thus inhibits activation of mTOR and downstream pathway members such as p70 ribosomal S6 kinase
(P70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1
(4EBP1).

Limited experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that
iNOS/NO-driven mTOR activation can contribute to oncogenic
signaling. Some studies have suggested that NO can activate
mTOR signaling in noncancer model systems, including murine
macrophages (16) and vascular smooth muscle cells (17).
However, as yet there have been no studies assessing the ability
of cancer-expressed iNOS and endogenously produced NO in
physiologic concentrations to activate the mTOR pathway.
In the current study, we assessed the effect of iNOS inhibition with small-molecule antagonists or RNA interferencemediated gene silencing (knockdown) on human melanoma
in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, which
has been widely used to study cancer growth and angiogenesis
in vivo (18). Our data show that in human melanoma, mTOR
pathway activation is dependent on iNOS expression/activity,
and support a model where iNOS modulates mTOR activity by
NO-mediated posttranslational modiﬁcation of the upstream
regulator TSC2.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines and chick embryo chorioallantoic
membrane model of tumor growth
Authenticated human melanoma lines, A375 and MeWo,
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The
line mel624 was obtained from the laboratory of E.A Grimm,
UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) and authenticated by the MD Anderson Characterized Cell Lines Core
Facility. For CAM assays, 2  106 log-phase, A375 cells were
implanted in 25 mL Matrigel on the CAM of 10-day-old chick
embryos (SPAFAS) as described (19, 20). Implanted cells were
treated with L-N-(1-Imonoethyl) Lysine (L-NIL) applied topically onto the upper CAM, or transfected 24 hours earlier with
iNOS-targeting, scrambled, or nontargeting control siRNA.
After 6 days, tumor growth was evaluated macroscopically,
and tumor tissue with a minimal amount of surrounding CAM
was minced, dissociated into single-cell suspension with type
1A collagenase, and live tumor cells counted by Trypan blue
exclusion. Alternatively, excised CAM tissues were homogenized with passive lysis buffer (Boston Bioproducts) for Western blot analysis, or ﬁxed in 10% zinc formalin, embedded in
parafﬁn, cut in 5-mm sections, and analyzed by hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Transient transfection of human melanoma cells
A375, Mel624, and/or MeWo cells were transfected with
Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen)
protocol. At 24 hours after transfection, cells were replated for
use in the indicated assays. Plasmid expressing the full-length
murine GFP- iNOS sequence was a generous gift from Ignacio
Rodriguez-Crespo (Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid,
Spain) and has been previously described (21). pMSCV-puro
GFP vector (Addgene) was used as a control. Human iNOStargeting siRNA Stealth RNA duplexes and nontargeting control siRNA (catalog number 46-2002) were from Invitrogen.
Chemicals and reagents
L-NIL (hydrochloride) and DEANONOate were purchased
from Cayman Chemical. 2-(4-Carboxyphenyl)-4,4, 5, 5–tetra-

methylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO), S-nitroso-penicillamine (SNAP), and dithiothreitol were from Sigma-Aldrich.
Vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG7204) was purchased from Selleckchem. All chemicals were prepared freshly from powdered
stock on the day of each experiment. All cell culture reagents
were from Invitrogen.
Western blot analyses
Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies against iNOS (sc-651; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mTOR
(sc-2983; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p-mTOR Ser 2448 (sc2971; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46;
sc-9459; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 4E-BP1 (sc-9977; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Tuberin/TSC2 (D57A9; sc-3990; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Hamartin/TSC1 (sc-4906), and Actin
(sc-1616; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by appropriate
secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
Results were visualized by commercial chemiluminiscence kit
(Millipore). Relative signal intensities for total and phosphoproteins were quantitated by densitometry using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD), and normalized densitometry
values were expressed as ratio of phospho- to total protein
levels.
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated for 1 hour
at 37 C with 100 or 300 mmol/L fresh SNAP, 100 mmol/L fresh
DEANONOate, and 1,000 or 3,000 mmol/L L-NIL. Cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in NP-40 and X100 plus
protease inhibitors for 10 minutes on ice, then cleared by
centrifugation (10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C). For TSC2
immunoprecipitation, the antibody (Bethyl Laboratories cat
A300-526A) was incubated with lysates on ice for 90 minutes
before treatment with protein A beads and incubation at 4 C
for 3 hours with gentle rotation. Beads were washed, recovered
between each wash by centrifugation (1,000 g for 30 seconds at
4 C), and resuspended in sample buffer before immunoblot
analysis.
Immunohistochemistry of CAM and clinical melanoma
specimens
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) sections (5
mmol/L) of excised human melanoma tumors from CAM were
immunostained for Ki-67 (sc-23900 Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
S100 (ab14849, Abcam), or HMB45 (Ventana Medical System,
Inc), p70 S6K (49D7; Cell Signaling Technology Cat # 2708),
Phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46; 236B4; Cell Signaling Technology
Cat # 2855), 4E-BP1 (53H11; Cell Signaling Technology Cat #
9644), iNOS (Creative Biolabs), nitrotyrosine (EMD Millipore
Corp.). Preimmune normal mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG;
Vector Laboratories) and anti-vimentin antibody (BioGenex
Laboratories) were used as negative and positive controls,
respectively
For Ki-67 staining of CAM tissue, the fractional area occupied by the immunoreactive Ki-67 was quantiﬁed with the
Bioquant image analysis system (BIOQUANT Image Analysis
Corporation) as previously described (22). Random ﬁelds from

iNOS Drives mTOR Pathway Activation by Nitrosylation of TSC2

seven independent sections were analyzed per sample and
averaged.
Rheb GTP-gS guanine nucleotide-binding assay
A375 cells were transfected with iNOS-targeting or control
siRNA as described above. Forty hours after transfection, cells
were washed once with phosphate-free Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (Invitrogen), and processed with the Rheb
Activation Assay Kit (NewEast Biosciences) as previously
described (23). For positive and negative controls, A375 cell
lysate, was incubated with GTP-gS or GDP, respectively, for 90
minutes before immunoprecipitation.
Biotin switch assay of S-nitrosylation
The biotin switch assay was performed according to the
method of Jaffrey and Snyder (24) with some modiﬁcations. Cell
lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer incubated for 16
hours at 37 C in the dark with either 100 mmol/L fresh SNAP,
1,000 mmol/L L-NIL, 300 mmol/L PTIO, and 1 hour with 10
mmol/L DTT room temperature or left untreated, after which
they were subjected to biotin-switch assay using the S-Nitrosylated Protein Detection Kit (Cayman Chemical). After the
biotin-switch assay, biotinilated proteins were pulled down with
streptavidine-agarose beads (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and the eluate
was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting.
Clonogenic survival assay
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at concentrations of 500/
well or 1,000/well in triplicate. After 24 hours, L-NIL was added
or cells were transiently transfected with siRNA as described
above before changing to serum-containing medium. Cells
were incubated for 10 to 14 days to form visible colonies.
Colonies were stained with methylene blue, rinsed with water,
air-dried and imaged and quantiﬁed by using ImageJ, and
colony number was counted. Cell colonies were visually identiﬁed and colonies more than 50 cells counted (25)
TUNEL staining
FFPE tissue sections (5 mm) from CAM were processed for
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL). The ApoTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore) was used according to the
manufacturer's instruction. Five different ﬁelds were counted
per sample. TUNEL kit: S7110, EMD Millipore Corporation.
Mounting Medium with propidium iodide is H-1300 (Vector
Laboratories).
Analysis of cell-cycle progression
Cells were plated at a density of 1  105 cells/5 mL medium
in 60 cm-diameter dishes and L-NIL added 24 hours later in
fresh medium. Adherent cells were harvested 48 hours later by
trypsinization and centrifugation. After washing with PBS,
propidium iodide was added and the DNA content of stained
nuclei analyzed by ﬂow cytometry with the FACSCalibur using
FlowJo 7.6 software.

Results
iNOS inhibition or knockdown suppresses in vivo growth
of human melanoma in the CAM model
Nitrotyrosine is a stable NO end product and marker of
cumulative iNOS activity (26). To assess the contribution of
iNOS to human melanoma growth in a physiologically relevant
setting, we established primary A375 melanoma tumors in the
CAM assay and treated them with the iNOS-selective competitive antagonist L-NIL (27, 28) or gene knockdown with iNOStargeting siRNA (29). iNOS knockdown decreased constitutive
iNOS gene expression (Fig. 1A), and both siRNA and L-NIL
markedly suppressed nitrotyrosine accumulation in A375
tumors grown on CAM (Fig. 1A and B).
Well-vascularized three-dimensional tumor nodules were
present by 6 days after inoculation of melanoma cells into
Matrigel upon the CAM. Immunohistochemical staining with
the melanoma markers S100 (Fig. 2A; ref. 30), and HMB45 (data
not shown) as well as conventional H&E sections (Fig. 2B)
veriﬁed discrete human melanoma tumors on the background
of chicken-derived CAM cells. iNOS knockdown (Fig. 2C) or
L-NIL (Fig. 2D) suppressed both macroscopic tumor growth
across several human melanoma cell lines (A375, Mel624, and
MeWo), and the number of viable tumor cells (Fig. 2B and C
and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Growth suppression of human melanoma after iNOS
knockdown or inhibition is associated with decreased
clonogenic survival and proliferation, and increased
apoptosis
The clonogenic survival assay has been shown to correlate
with tumor cell proliferative capacity in vivo (31). Both iNOS
inhibition and knockdown suppressed in vitro clonogenic
growth of A375 cells (Fig. 3A), consistent with the marked
reduction in in vivo tumor growth. L-NIL treatment in vitro also
arrested A375 cells at the G2–M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3B;
ref. 32). iNOS knockdown in vivo also inhibited by over 50%
immunostaining for the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 3C;
ref. 33). Furthermore, iNOS knockdown increased by 2-fold
apoptosis in vivo as measured by TUNEL assay (Fig. 3D; ref. 34).
Thus, the marked melanoma growth suppression observed
with iNOS inhibition or silencing is the result of concomitant
inhibition of proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death.
Constitutive activation of the mTOR growth/survival
pathway in vivo is downregulated by knockdown or
inhibition of iNOS in human melanoma
Because the mTOR pathway has been shown to be a key
mediator of proliferation and survival for melanoma (35) and

metastatic melanoma cell lines grown in CAM, A375 (bearing
the clinically signiﬁcant BRAFV600E mutation; Fig. 4A and B),
and MeWo (wild-type BRAF; Fig. 4C and D). iNOS-targeting
siRNA and iNOS inhibition with L-NIL coordinately downregulated expression of the activated (phosphorylated) form of
multiple mTOR pathway members in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A and B).
Speciﬁcity of the iNOS-targeting siRNA is demonstrated by
the similar effect of siRNA constructs targeting different
regions of the iNOS gene (Fig. 4C), and the lack of effect of
two different control constructs derived from scrambled
iNOS-targeting sequences (Figs. 2C and 4A and C) We further
conﬁrmed speciﬁcity of iNOS-targeting siRNA by performing
genetic rescue of siRNA-treated cells with a construct expres-

sing GFP fused to murine iNOS (GFP-iNOS; Fig. 5A; ref. 21),
which is incompletely homologous with the human ortholog
and thus resistant to knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S2).
GFP iNOS markedly upregulated iNOS expression and
reversed siRNA-mediated inhibition of S6RP and 4EBP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). We also noted modest, but reproducible
upregulation of S6RP and 4EBP1 phosphorylation in cells
transfected with the GFP-iNOS construct but not GFP alone,
consistent with previously published data (37). Taken together, our results demonstrate that endogenous iNOS expression
is required to maintain high levels of the constitutive mTOR
pathway activation in two human melanoma and that inhibition of iNOS activity or gene expression markedly downregulates mTOR signaling in melanoma cells in a reversible
fashion.

iNOS-mediated S-nitrosylation of TSC2 regulates
TSC2/TSC1 dimerization and the activity of the
mTOR-activating small GTPase Rheb
S-Nitrosylation is a reversible NO-mediated posttranslational modiﬁcation of cysteine residues, which can affect protein
stability or activity, and thus a candidate mediator of activation
by iNOS. To examine whether this mechanism occurs in
human melanoma cells, A375 cells were treated with SNAP
(a donor of NO), PTIO (an NO scavenger), or L-NIL for 16 hours
before harvest of cell lysates and biotin switch assay to detect
nitrosylated proteins (38). Constitutively nitrosylated proteins

To assess nitrosylation of speciﬁc mTOR pathway proteins,
we performed a streptavidin-agarose pulldown after the biotin
switch reaction, followed by immunoblot analysis for speciﬁc
proteins of interest. This method successfully detected nitrosylation of several control proteins previously known to be
S-nitrosylated, including Bcl-2 (39) and AKT (Supplementary
Fig. S3; ref. 40). We observed endogenous nitrosylation of TSC2,
which was enhanced by treatment of the cell lysate with the NO
donor SNAP. Reversibility of TSC2 nitrosylation was conﬁrmed
by loss of the SNO-TSC2 band after biotin switch with lysate

does not affect TSC2 stability.
TSC1/TSC2 dimerization is a critical checkpoint for downstream Rheb activation required for mTOR pathway signaling.
To further characterize the mechanism of NO-mediated control of TSC2 activity, we performed coimmunoprecipitation

association of TSC2 nitrosylation with activation of downstream signaling, by assessing Rheb GTPase activity. iNOStargeting siRNA almost completely inhibited Rheb activation
(Fig. 6D), demonstrating control of Rheb activity by iNOS.
Although iNOS and NO can potentially also control mTOR
pathway activation by acting on AKT or on upstream pathways, which modulate AKT activation (41), we saw no evidence
that iNOS inhibition downregulated AKT phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We also saw little effect of the NOdependent guanyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ, on mTOR pathway
activation (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that iNOS/NO

iNOS Drives mTOR Pathway Activation by Nitrosylation of TSC2

Figure 4. iNOS knockdown or targeted inhibition suppresses mTOR pathway activation in vivo. A375 cells were transfected with iNOS-targeting or control
siRNA (A) or the indicated concentrations of L-NIL and CAM assay (B) performed as described in Fig. 1. Whole-cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
Western blot analysis for mTOR phosphorylated at serine 2448 (Ser2448), p-P70S6K phosphorylated at threonine 389 (Thr389), p-4EBP1 phosphorylated at
threonine 37/46 (Thr37/46), p-S6RP phospho at serine 235/236 (Ser235/236), and actin as a loading control. C, MeWo cells were transfected with
iNOS-targeting or control siRNA before CAM assay and Western blot analysis for mTOR, p-P70S6K, p-4EBP1, p-S6RP, and actin. D, quantitation of
phospho-4EBP1 versus total protein and phospho-S6RP versus actin was by densitometric analysis. All graphs represent data derived from

regulation is independent of this mechanism. Thus, we infer
that iNOS/NO indirectly controls Rheb activity by nitrosylation
of the immediately upstream regulator TSC2.
Coexpression of iNOS, nitrotyrosine, p-4EBP1, and
p70S6K in clinical melanoma samples, and effect of NO
on mTOR signaling downstream of B-Raf
We used IHC to examine expression of iNOS, nitrotyrosine, p-4EBP1, and p70S6K in vivo in tissue microarrays
(TMA) from metastatic tumors from stage III melanoma
patients (representative stains shown in Fig. 7A). Staining for
iNOS was discrete and variable among tumors, whereas the
NO biomarker nitrotyrosine showed more diffuse staining,
consistent with the high diffusivity of NO. Antibodies to
phospho-4EBP1 and p70S6K also showed the anticipated
cytoplasmic staining.
To explore whether iNOS and nitrotyrosine staining levels
correlated with mTOR pathway activation, we evaluated

staining number (% of cells positively staining) and intensity
for all markers in random ﬁelds from three TMA cores (6)
and tested for pairwise associations between markers, and
between staining intensity and overall and disease-free
survival. Of 118 available patient samples, staining data were
available for 112 (nitrotyrosine), 108 (iNOS), 103 (p-4EBP1),
and 100 (p70S6K) patients. We found a signiﬁcant correlation between iNOS and nitrotyrosine staining number (P ¼
0.0043) and intensity (P < 0.0001), consistent with the role of
iNOS as the primary NO-producing enzyme in human melanoma cells. We also found statistically signiﬁcant associations between phospho-4EBP1 and p70S6K number (P <
0.0001) and intensity (P < 0.0001) by Fisher exact test,
presumably reﬂecting upregulation of both markers during
the mTOR pathway activation. iNOS staining intensity and
nitrotyrosine staining intensity were signiﬁcantly correlated
with p70S6K and nitrotyrosine intensity, respectively (Fig.
7B). Thus, we observed a positive association between iNOS

melanoma specimens similar to what we observed in human
melanoma in the CAM assay
We then examined the effect of NO on mTOR signaling
downstream of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032/
RG7204; refs. 39, 40) because it is used clinically in treatment of
melanoma. Cells were treated with vemurafenib and the
exogenous NO donor DEANONOate, or a combination of both
for 3 hours. Western blot analysis revealed that short-term
treatment with vemurafenib alone markedly reduced phosphorylation of downstream mTOR pathway members S6RP
and 4EBP1 in A375 lysates. We found that exogenously supplied NO reverses mTOR inhibition seen after vemurafenib

Cancer Res; 74(4) February 15, 2014

In the present study, we used human melanoma grown in
the in vivo CAM model to test the hypothesis that iNOS
upregulation by cancer cells enhances tumor growth and
survival by driving mTOR pathway activation, a critical mediator of oncogenic signaling. We found that iNOS expression in
human melanoma leads to nitrosylation of TSC2, which is
associated with impaired dimerization of TSC2 with its inhibitory partner TSC1 and enhanced activation of its target, the
small GTPase Rheb, and subsequent activation of downstream
members of the mTOR pathway. iNOS-mediated activation of
mTOR signaling is oncologically signiﬁcant, leading to
enhanced proliferation as measured by Ki-67 immunostaining
and cell-cycle analysis, decreased apoptosis, and macroscopic
tumor growth on CAM. We also ﬁnd evidence that iNOS-driven
mTOR activation is clinically relevant because iNOS and
nitrotyrosine expressions are positively correlated with S6K
and phospho-4EBP1 upregulation by IHC of metastatic human
melanoma samples.
In the present study, we functionally dissect the role of
endogenous iNOS/NO expression with the selective iNOS
inhibitor L-NIL and iNOS-targeting siRNA, thus showing that
the upregulation of iNOS previously reported in melanoma
and many other cancers is itself sufﬁcient to drive mTOR
pathway activation and tumor growth. This is consistent
with prior studies showing that iNOS upregulation induces
many of the hallmarks of mTOR activation (proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, treatment resistance) and is associated with poor prognosis in human melanoma patients. In
fact, downregulation of mTOR activation by iNOS inhibition
or knockdown was associated with a striking reduction in
melanoma growth on the CAM, similar to that which we
have previously reported in mouse xenograft studies (27).
We also noted a robust effect of iNOS inhibition or knockdown on in vitro colony formation by human melanoma
cells, suggesting that even in vitro iNOS may be required for
optimum clonogenicity of founder cells. We also found that
exogenously supplied NO reverses mTOR pathway inhibition
seen after vemurafenib treatment, suggesting that NO can
act downstream of BRAF to bypass BRAF inhibition, and
thus is a potential mechanism of escape (40, 42).
Although NO is pleiotropic and can potentially regulate
mTOR pathway activation through other mechanism, such
as nitrosylation of EGF receptor and other molecules
upstream of mTOR signaling (PMID 22878588), our study
is also the ﬁrst to propose nitrosylation of an mTOR pathway
member as a biochemical mechanism linking cancer-related
iNOS/NO overexpression with pathway activation. NO can
alter signal transduction pathways via covalent modiﬁcation
of target proteins through nitration and nitrosylation. We
show by biotin switch assay that TSC2, which in the activated state acts to suppress mTOR activation, by forming a
Rheb-inactivating complex with TSC1, is constitutively
nitrosylated in melanoma cells. Immunoprecipitation

nitrosylated, and ongoing work in our laboratory is focused
on identifying speciﬁc cysteines that are targets for nitrosylation in melanoma cells.
A limitation of our study approach is the possibility that
iNOS is abnormally dysregulated in the CAM system, and
thus our results are not relevant to melanoma in human
patients. However, melanoma lines used in this study
constitutively express iNOS even in tissue culture, and
iNOS expression is well documented in human melanoma
cell lines and clinical specimens. Also the correlation
between iNOS and NO expression levels and S6K and
4EBP1 we observed in human clinical metastatic melanoma specimens supports the relevance of this mechanism to
clinical melanoma. Although other NOS isoforms (NOS1,
NOS3) may also be expressed in cancer cells and play a role
in their biology, we conclude that in our system iNOS is a

cells.
iNOS and other inﬂammatory molecules have been shown to
play pivotal roles in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, proliferation, and apoptosis resistance of human cancers. Molecular therapy targeting cancer-related inﬂammation is an
attractive approach to cancer treatment because iNOS and
other inﬂammatory mediators are broadly overexpressed in a
number of human cancers, largely dispensable for untransformed cells, and amenable to pharmacologic inhibition. We
and others have described potent antitumor effects of iNOS
inhibition, which are both direct (43, 44) and indirect (28),
highlighting the dual role of iNOS as signaling molecule and
inﬂammatory mediator. Our results provide a convincing
biologic mechanism by which iNOS upregulation activates
oncogenic signaling in melanoma cells through the posttranslational modiﬁcation of TSC2, and set the stage for further
