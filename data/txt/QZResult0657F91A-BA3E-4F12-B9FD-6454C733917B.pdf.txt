ABSTRACT
The importance of the cell surface receptor CXCR4 and the chemokine stromal
cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) is well-established in normal and malignant
hematopoiesis. The Protein Epitope Mimetic POL5551 is a novel and potent antagonist
of CXCR4. POL5551 efficiently mobilizes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells,
but its effects in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have not been reported. Here,
we demonstrate that POL5551 is a potent antagonist of CXCR4 in pre-B and T cell
ALL cell lines and pediatric ALL primary samples. POL5551 has activity at nanomolar
concentrations in decreasing CXCR4 antibody binding, blocking SDF-1α-mediated
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, inhibiting SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis, and reversing
stromal-mediated protection from chemotherapy. POL5551 is significantly more
effective at inhibiting CXCR4 antibody binding than the FDA-approved CXCR4 inhibitor
plerixafor in ALL cell lines and primary samples. We also show that treatment with
POL5551 in vitro and cytarabine +/− POL5551 in vivo modulates surface expression
of adhesion molecules, findings that may guide the optimal clinical use of POL5551.
Finally, we demonstrate that POL5551 increases sensitivity to cytarabine in a
xenograft model of a high-risk pediatric ALL, infant MLL-rearranged (MLL-R) ALL.
Therefore, disruption of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis with POL5551 may improve outcomes
in children with high-risk ALL.

Specifically, interaction between the cell surface receptor
CXCR4 and the chemokine SDF-1 (CXCL12) is critical
in signaling between leukemic blasts and the bone marrow
microenvironment [11–17]. We previously demonstrated
that CXCR4 is an important mediator of chemotherapy
resistance in pediatric ALL and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), and that treatment with the FDA-approved
CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor could reverse stromal
protection and chemotherapy resistance [8–10]. Therefore,
disruption of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis is a rational means
to target extrinsic survival mechanisms in ALL. The novel
Protein Epitope Mimetic (PEM) POL5551 is a selective

INTRODUCTION
ALL is the most common pediatric malignancy.
Advances in the treatment of ALL, including the use of
multi-agent chemotherapy, improvements in supportive
care, and risk stratification, have led to event-free survival
rates that are now approaching 90% [1]. However,
children and young adults with high-risk and relapsed/
refractory ALL continue to have suboptimal outcomes.
[2] We and others have demonstrated that interaction
with the bone marrow microenvironment is important
in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies [3–10].

and potent antagonist of CXCR4. PEMs are medium sized,
fully synthetic cyclic peptide-like molecules that mimic
the two most relevant secondary structure motifs involved
in protein-protein interactions: ß-hairpins and α-helices
[18]. Recent reports have demonstrated that treatment
with POL5551 inhibits vascular accumulation of CXCR4expressing smooth muscle cells [19] and that POL5551
is a potent and effective mobilizer of hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells [20]. We offer the first report
of this novel CXCR4 antagonist in pediatric ALL. We
demonstrate that POL5551 is a potent antagonist of
surface CXCR4 in pediatric ALL cell lines and primary
samples. POL5551 also decreases SDF-1α-mediated
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, inhibits chemotaxis induced
by SDF-1α, and reverses stroma-mediated chemotherapy
resistance. In addition, surface expression of adhesion
molecules is affected by in vitro and in vivo treatment.
Finally, POL5551 enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy
in a xenograft model of infant MLL-rearranged (MLL-R)
ALL, a high-risk subtype of ALL. Therefore, interruption
of leukemia-microenvironment signaling with POL5551
may prove to be an effective strategy in the treatment of
pediatric ALL.

binding (Figures 1C–1D). We verified these results
by treating Nalm-6 with the same concentrations of
POL5551 and plerixafor. We again found that POL5551
was able to consistently inhibit 12G5 antibody binding
by 50% at concentrations <5 nM, while the maximum
effect of plerixafor approached 20% inhibition at the
maximum tested concentration of 40 nM (Figure 1E).
From these experiments, we concluded that POL5551 is
a potent and sustained antagonist of surface CXCR4 in
pediatric ALL.

POL5551 inhibits CXCR4 12G5 antibody
binding but enhances 1D9 and 2B11 antibody
binding
We and others have shown that treatment of
leukemic blasts with plerixafor leads to a decrease in 12G5
antibody binding to surface CXCR4, while simultaneously
causing an increase in 1D9 antibody binding surface
CXCR4 [10, 21]. While the 12G5 antibody competes with
SDF-1α and plerixafor for the same CXCR4 binding site,
[22] the 1D9 antibody binds to CXCR4 at an alternative
site with which SDF-1α and plerixafor do not interact [21].
Therefore, 12G5 antibody binding can be interpreted as
binding free surface CXCR4 that has not bound plerixafor
or SDF-1α. Conversely, 1D9 antibody binding is a
measure of total surface CXCR4. We sought to determine
if the same phenomena occurred after treatment of ALL
with POL5551. We treated 2 pre-B and 2 T cell ALL
cell lines with a concentration range of POL5551 over
72 hours. At multiple time points, we measured binding to
surface CXCR4 by flow cytometry using 3 anti-CXCR4
antibodies: 12G5, 1D9, and 2B11. The 2B11 anti-mouse
CXCR4 antibody, which does not compete with SDF-1α
or drug binding, was previously reported to bind to human
CXCR4 [23], and we verified this in earlier experiments
[10]. As in our previous experiments, 12G5 binding was
decreased by POL5551 even at 1 hour and this effect
was concentration-dependent. Notably, we found an
increase in 1D9 and 2B11 antibody binding that was
both time and concentration-dependent in all 4 cell lines
tested (Figures 2A–2D). These results suggest that while
POL5551 inhibits CXCR4 at the SDF-1α binding site,
POL5551 leads to an increase in 1D9 and 2B11 binding to
surface CXCR4 over time. Importantly, POL5551 is still
able to potently block the SDF-1α-binding site through
72 hours of treatment.

RESULTS
POL5551 is a potent antagonist of surface
CXCR4 in pre-B and T cell ALL cell lines
We first wanted to determine if treatment with
POL5551 could decrease antibody binding to surface
CXCR4 in pediatric ALL. To do this, we treated a
representative pre-B ALL cell line, Nalm-6, with a
concentration range of POL5551 over a time course. We
then harvested cells and measured binding of the 12G5
anti-CXCR4 antibody, which attaches to the SDF-1α
binding site of CXCR4, by FACS as a marker for surface
CXCR4 expression. Inhibition of 12G5 antibody binding
by POL5551 was potent (IC50 of 12G5 binding at 1 hour
0.95 nM), rapid (<1 hour) and sustained (>48 hours)
(Figure 1A). Next, we treated an additional 3 pre-B
and 3 T cell ALL cell lines with POL5551 over a time
course to determine if POL5551 could inhibit surface
CXCR4 antibody binding across multiple cell lines.
POL5551 potently antagonized surface CXCR4 antibody
binding, as the IC50 of 12G5 binding was ≤2.5 nM at
1 hour in 5 of the 6 cell lines tested (Figures 1A–1B).
In addition, 50% inhibition of surface CXCR4 antibody
binding was maintained at 48 hours by treatment with
≤5 nM POL5551 in 5 of the 6 cell lines. For comparison,
we also treated the cell lines with plerixafor and again
measured 12G5 antibody binding. We found that
while plerixafor also inhibited 12G5 antibody binding,
POL5551 was significantly more potent, as severalfold higher concentrations of plerixafor were needed
to achieve similar levels of reduction of 12G5 antibody

that CXCR4 antagonism with POL5551 would modulate

bone marrow stromal microenvironment [27]. In addition,
we have shown that treatment with plerixafor leads to an
increase in surface expression of CXCR7 in ALL [10]
and others have demonstrated that activation of CXCR4
leads to increased VLA-4-mediated adhesion of ALL
blasts [4]. Therefore, we hypothesized that antagonism
of CXCR4 with POL5551 would lead to increased
surface expression of CXCR7 and VLA-4. We found that
treatment of ALL cell lines with POL5551 did in fact lead
to increased CXCR7 expression at early treatment time
points that began to decrease by 24 hours (Figure 3A). We
did not find a consistent effect of POL5551 on VLA- 4
(via anti-CD49d antibodies) surface expression (data not
shown). Next, to determine if POL5551 could inhibit
phosphorylation of a downstream target of CXCR4, we
treated ALL cell lines with POL5551 or vehicle control
and then stimulated CXCR4 with recombinant SDF-1α or
vehicle control. Activation of CXCR4 with SDF-1α led
to an increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in controltreated cells. This increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation
was attenuated by increasing concentrations of POL5551
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 3B). Finally, to determine if treatment with
POL5551 could decrease SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis,
we treated cells with POL5551 or vehicle control, and
measured migration of ALL cells through a permeable
membrane toward medium containing SDF-1α. Treatment
with POL5551 led to a statistically significant decrease in
chemotaxis in the majority of cell lines tested (Figure 3C).
From these experiments, we concluded that antagonism
of surface CXCR4 by POL5551 led to functional
effects, including a transient increase in surface CXCR7
expression, decreased SDF-1α-induced phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, and inhibition of SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis.

POL5551 decreases stromal protection and
increases sensitivity to chemotherapy
We also hypothesized that POL5551 could decrease
stromal protection from chemotherapy through antagonism
of CXCR4. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated cells
with a concentration range of chemotherapy in 3 culture
conditions (Figure 4A). After chemotherapy treatment,

we measured apoptosis with Annexin V and 7-AAD and
calculated IC values by culture condition. We then used
these IC values to calculate a Protective Index (PI), which
quantifies the protective effect of stroma, and a Reversal
Index (RI), which quantifies the ability of POL5551
to decrease or reverse stromal protection, as we have
previously published [9, 10]. Briefly, we defined PI as the
IC values on stroma divided by the IC values off stroma.
Therefore, PI > 1 denotes stromal protection. Similarly, we
defined RI as the IC values on stroma + POL5551 divided
by the IC values off stroma. Therefore, RI > 1 signifies
some stromal protection in the presence of POL5551 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stroma, RI < PI denotes a decrease in stromal protection
by POL5551, and RI < 1 indicates complete reversal of
stromal protection by POL5551. Stroma protected Molt- 4,
HB-1119, and Nalm-6 from chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis. Remarkably, treatment with 20 nM POL5551
was sufficient to decrease stromal protection in Molt-4 and
HB-1119 and even reverse stromal protection in Nalm- 6
(Figures 4B–4D). These findings suggest that stromal
protection from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in ALL
is mediated through CXCR4 and that administration
of POL5551 decreases stromal protection and restores
sensitivity to chemotherapy in our co-culture model.

POL5551 antagonizes surface CXCR4 in
primary samples of pediatric ALL

can increase sensitivity to chemotherapy even in highrisk pediatric ALL. Therefore, we transplanted primary
samples from infants with MLL-R ALL. These patients
have an extremely poor prognosis [28] and primary
samples of infant MLL-R ALL have engrafted very
well in our previous experiments [8, 10]. To make our
xenograft model even more aggressive, we transplanted
cells that had already been passaged once through NOD/
SCID/γcnull (NSG) mice in order to select for leukemiainitiating cells from the cryopreserved primary samples.
We performed this experiment using 4 different infant
MLL-R ALL primary samples (Figure 6A). Overall
leukemic burden (Figure 6B and Supplemental Figure
1A) did not differ significantly between mice treated
with either vehicle control (56.2%) or POL5551 alone
(49.5%). However, treatment with cytarabine (36.7%)
or the combination of POL5551 and cytarabine (26.3%)
significantly decreased total leukemic burden compared
to vehicle control. Impressively, treatment with
POL5551 and cytarabine significantly decreased total
leukemic burden compared to treatment with cytarabine
alone (p = 0.001), demonstrating that POL5551
increased sensitivity to cytarabine. When we analyzed
leukemic burden by organ, we found a striking decrease

We also wanted to verify some of our findings
using primary samples of pediatric pre-B and T cell ALL.
First, we treated primary samples of pediatric ALL with
POL5551 and plerixafor and measured 12G5 antibody
binding. We found that POL5551 potently blocked
binding of the 12G5 antibody and was again significantly
more potent than plerixafor in both pre-B (Figure 5A)
and T cell ALL primary samples (Figure 5B). Next, we
measured SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis as a measure of
functional CXCR4 antagonism. Similar to our cell line
experiments, we found that treatment with POL5551
decreased migration of primary ALL samples toward an
SDF-1α gradient (Figure 5C). These data indicate that
POL5551 is active against CXCR4 in primary samples of
pediatric ALL.

(42.8% vs. 49.5%), spleen (16.9 vs. 30.8%), and blood
(19.3% vs. 29.6%). These results suggest that inhibition
of CXCR4 with POL5551 may enhance sensitivity to
cytarabine in infants with MLL-R ALL.

treatment received had an effect on surface expression
of these adhesion molecules. We found that surface

expression of CXCR4 as measured by either the 12G5
or 1D9 antibody was lowest in the bone marrow and
highest in the peripheral blood (Supplemental Figure 2A).
Conversely, surface expression of CD49d was highest
in the bone marrow and lowest in the peripheral blood
(Supplemental Figure 2A). These findings are consistent
with an inverse, homeostatic relationship between CXCR4
and VLA-4 that has been described previously [4, 10].
Interestingly, we also found that surface expression of
CXCR7 was higher in the spleen and peripheral blood than
in the bone marrow where the concentration of SDF-1α is
the highest (Supplemental Figure 2A). These findings may
indicate that leukemic blasts located outside of the bone
marrow may have increased surface expression of CXCR4
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and CXCR7 in order to become more responsive to
SDF- 1α and home to areas of high SDF-1α concentration.
When we analyzed our results by treatment cohort,
both cytarabine (p < 0.01 vs. control) and POL5551
and cytarabine (p < 0.05 vs. control) led to significantly
decreased 12G5 antibody binding in splenic blasts
with a moderate but non-significant decrease in 12G5
antibody binding in blasts isolated from bone marrow and
peripheral blood (Supplemental Figure 2B). In contrast, a
trend toward increased 1D9 antibody binding was found
in blasts isolated from bone marrow and peripheral blood
(Supplemental Figure 2C). Further, CXCR7 surface
expression in leukemic blasts isolated from the bone
marrow (p ≤ 0.01), spleen (p < 0.05), and peripheral blood

only 47% achieved a long-term remission [28]. Further,
patients who were negative for minimal residual disease
(MRD) after induction and consolidation therapy still had
a 5-year relapse rate of 13% [31]. In comparison, analysis
of the most recent St. Jude Total Therapy trials reported
a 5-year cumulative risk of relapse of only 5% in MRDnegative patients [32]. It is important to note both that the
St. Jude MRD cutoff was 10-fold higher than Interfant-99
(0.001% vs. 0.0001% leukemia by PCR) and that only
2 of the 379 patients included in the St. Jude analysis were
infants. These results suggest that leukemia-initiating cells
are able to persist in infant ALL despite the achievement
of a deep MRD-negative remission. Therefore, the use of
CXCR4 antagonists may be a means to improve outcome
in infant MLL-R ALL by targeting MRD and leukemiainitiating cells (LIC).
CXCR4 antagonism has been advanced clinically in
acute leukemia. Trials of plerixafor as a chemosensitizing
agent have been completed in adults with relapsed/
refractory [21] and newly-diagnosed AML, [33] and
children with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias [34].
One concern about CXCR4 antagonism is that mobilized
hematopoietic stem cells will become more susceptible to
chemotherapy and lead to delayed blood count recovery.
These phase 1/2 trials showed tolerability and efficacy
of plerixafor as a chemosensitizing agent and none of
them reported prolonged count recovery. With regards to
our experiments, POL5551 was recently shown to be an
effective mobilizer of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells in a mouse model, [20] and so we paid special
attention to the health of our mice. We noted that mice in
the cytarabine only cohorts were the only mice that were
thin and hunched at sacrifice. Mice in the control cohort
appeared well despite high leukemic burden. Those treated
with POL5551 alone or in combination with cytarabine
also looked healthy, suggesting that the combination
did not have an adverse effect on the overall health of
the mice. Another concern about CXCR4 antagonism
as a treatment strategy in hematologic malignancies is
the prospect of mobilizing leukemic cells from the bone
marrow to other sites and contributing to disease spread.
In our model, leukemic burden in mice treated with
POL5551 alone was not significantly different than that of
control-treated mice, suggesting that POL5551-mobilized
blasts did not lead to an increase in disease. Further, none
of the aforementioned trials reported the development of
extramedullary disease after treatment.
CXCR4 antagonism not only enhances the efficacy
of chemotherapy, but also of targeted agents, including
FLT3 inhibitors, [8] and BCR-ABL inhibitors [17, 35].
Therefore, combining POL5551 with newer targeted agents,
such as inhibitors of BRD4 [36] or DOT-1L [37] in MLLR leukemias and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and
mTOR inhibitors in hypodiploid ALL [38] and Philadelphia
chromosome-like ALL, [39] may improve outcome in these
high-risk pediatric leukemias. Our findings support the

(p ≤ 0.001) was significantly higher in mice treated with
cytarabine-containing regimens, compared to controltreated mice (Supplemental Figure 2D). CD49d mean
fluorescence index (MFI) was increased in leukemic blasts
isolated from the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral
blood of mice treated with either cytarabine or POL5551
and cytarabine compared to control, but these differences
were not statistically significant (Supplemental Figure 2E).
Our data suggest that anti-leukemic therapies may alter
the interaction of surviving blasts with the bone marrow
microenvironment.

DISCUSSION
Efforts to improve outcomes in pediatric ALL have
largely been focused on factors intrinsic to the leukemic
blast, such as genetic mutations or alterations in gene
expression [2]. However, it is likely that survival signals
from the bone marrow microenvironment also contribute
to treatment failure and relapse [27, 29]. As such, many
groups have studied CXCR4 antagonism as a means to
improve outcomes in acute leukemias. Several preclinical
studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 antagonism with
plerixafor enhances in vivo sensitivity to anti-leukemic
therapies [8, 10, 15]. Our paper is the first demonstration
of the efficacy of the novel CXCR4 antagonist POL5551
in hematologic malignancies. Our experiments also show
that POL5551 is a more potent antagonist of CXCR4 in
pediatric ALL than plerixafor.
In our initial in vitro experiments, we found that
POL5551 binds to surface CXCR4 at the 12G5- (and
thus SDF-1α-) binding site, which results in functional
consequences, namely the attenuation of SDF-1α-mediated
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, inhibition of SDF-1α-induced
chemotaxis, and restoration of chemosensitivity in a stroma
co-culture model. We used infant MLL-R ALL primary
samples to confirm these findings in an in vivo model.
In previous work, we showed that MLL-R ALL primary
samples have a survival advantage on bone marrow
stroma feeder layers compared to non-MLL-R primary
samples, which suggests that interaction with stroma is
important in MLL-R ALL [8]. We selected cytarabine as
our chemotherapeutic agent because of its tolerability in
this mouse strain and because of its efficacy in infant ALL
[30]. As expected, cytarabine decreased leukemic burden
in our xenografts. Notably, the addition of POL5551
enhanced the efficacy of cytarabine; this was particularly
evident in the bone marrow, where our dose of cytarabine
did not lead to a significant decrease in leukemic burden
compared to vehicle control. Collectively, these findings
suggest that inhibition of leukemia-stromal interactions is
an important component in the treatment of this high-risk
subtype of pediatric ALL. There is also clinical evidence
to support our hypothesis. The Interfant-99 trial, which
enrolled 482 infants with ALL, reported that while 94%
of patients achieved remission after induction therapy,

15 minutes, and prepared according to the BD Phosflow
Protocol for Human PBMCs (BD Biosciences). Briefly,
cells were fixed, permeabilized, stained with Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated anti-human ERK1/2 (pT202/pY204, BD
Biosciences), and read on a FACSCalibur. The MFI of live
cells were calculated using FlowJo and normalized to the
IC MFI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Pre-B ALL cell lines (697, HB-1119, Nalm-6,
SEMK2) and T cell ALL cell lines (CCRF-CEM-1301,
Jurkat, Molt-4) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas,
VA), DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany), and SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento,
CA), penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies), and
L-glutamine (Life Technologies). Diagnostic bone
marrow or peripheral blood samples were collected under
institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols
from newly diagnosed children with ALL. Cells were
isolated, viably cryopreserved, and cultured as previously
described [8–10]. Bone marrow was collected from
adult bone marrow donors according to a Johns Hopkins
IRB-approved protocol. Stromal cells were isolated and
cultured as previously described [8–10].

Chemotaxis
Chemotaxis of cells treated with either vehicle
control or 10 nM POL5551 toward medium with or
without human recombinant SDF-1α (150 ng/mL) was
measured as previously described [9, 10].

Stroma co-culture
Cells were cultured in 3 conditions: off stroma,
on stroma, or pretreated with 20 nM POL5551 for
30 minutes then plated on stroma. Cells were then treated
with a concentration range of chemotherapy (cytarabine
[AraC] or daunorubicin, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours in
duplicate wells. Concentration ranges of cytarabine and
daunorubicin were unique to each cell line and contained
the IC50 at 24 hours, based on pilot experiments. Cells
were harvested, washed with ice-cold wash buffer, stained
with anti-human CD19-FITC (pre-B cell lines) or antihuman CD3-FITC (T cell lines), washed, and stained
with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD (all antibodies from BD
Pharmingen). After gating on CD19+/CD3+ cells, viable
cells were defined as Annexin and 7-AAD negative.
The IC10-IC90 values of each culture condition were
calculated using Calcusyn (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK)
and used to calculate the Protective Index (PI) and the
Reversal Index (RI) [10].

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
ALL cell lines and primary samples were treated
with a concentration range of POL5551 (kindly provided
by Polyphor, Allschwil, Switzerland) or plerixafor (kindly
provided by Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Cells were
harvested at multiple time points, washed with ice-cold
wash buffer (PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin,
Sigma-Aldrich), stained with antibodies at manufacturerrecommended concentrations (12G5 anti-human CD184
[CXCR4]-APC, eBioscience, San Diego, CA; 12G5 antihuman CD184-PE-Cy5, BD Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA; 1D9 anti-human CD184-PE, BD Pharmingen;
2B11 anti-mouse CD184-APC, eBioscience; anti-human
CXCR7- PerCP, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), washed,
fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (VWR, Radnor, PA), and
stored at 4°C in the dark until analysis on a FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A live gate was drawn
using FlowJo (TreeStar, Ashland, OR) according to forward/
side scatter properties and used to calculate the MFI. MFI
were normalized to the isotype control (IC) MFI at each
time point and then normalized to the MFI:IC ratio of
control-treated (0 nM) samples. Because CXCR7 MFI were
relatively low, we quantified surface CXCR7 expression as
the percentage of cells expressing CXCR7 (i.e., cells that
had a CXCR7 MFI ≥ 95th percentile of the IC MFI).

Xenograft experiments
Cryopreserved primary ALL cells were thawed,
counted (TC10 Automated Cell Counter, BioRad,
Hercules, CA), and resuspended in cold PBS. Adult
NSG mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were
sublethally irradiated (200 centiGray) 4 hours prior to
the transplantation of 1 × 106 viable cells via tail vein
injection. Mice were started on Uniprim medicated feed
(Harlan Laboratories, Frederick, MD) ≥ 24 hours prior
to transplantation in order to decrease opportunistic
infections. Peripheral blood was collected via cheek
venipuncture 4 to 6 weeks post-transplant and analyzed
by FACS after staining with anti-human CD19-FITC and
anti-human CD45-PE (BD Pharmingen). Leukemic blasts
were defined as cells that co-expressed human CD45 and
human CD19. Mice were sacrificed 2 to 4 weeks postengraftment and leukemic cells were harvested from the
spleen and bone marrow.

PhosphoFACS
Cells were serum starved for 2 hours (RPMI with
0.5% FBS), treated with POL5551 or vehicle control for

REFERENCES

Leukemic blasts (1 × 106 per mouse) were then
secondarily transplanted into sublethally irradiated NSG
mice for treatment experiments. After a 2-week period
of engraftment, as we had done in previous experiments
[8, 10], mice were divided into 4 treatment cohorts
(n  = 5 mice/cohort) and treated on 3 consecutive
days for 2 weeks with 1) vehicle control (PBS via
subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection), 2) POL5551
(5 mg/kg via subcutaneous injection), 3) cytarabine (200
mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection), or 4) POL5551
followed by cytarabine 4 hours later. After sacrifice,
cells were isolated from bone marrow, spleen, and
peripheral blood; counted; and stained with anti-human
FACS antibodies (CD19- FITC, CD45-PE/APC, 12G5
CXCR4-APC, 1D9 CXCR4-PE, CXCR7-PerCP, and/or
CD49d-PE-Cy5).
