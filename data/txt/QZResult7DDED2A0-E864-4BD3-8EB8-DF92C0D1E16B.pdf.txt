Abstract
The insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-1
receptor (IGF1R) are receptor tyrosine kinases that participate in mitogenic and antiapoptotic signaling in normal and
neoplastic epithelia. In the present study, immunoblotting and
reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated expression of IGF1R
and IR isoform A in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell
lines as well as in >80% of clinical AML isolates. Treatment
with insulin enhanced signaling through the Akt and MEK1/2
pathways as well as survival of serum-starved AML cell lines.
Conversely, treatment with BMS-536924, a dual IGF1R/IR
kinase inhibitor that is undergoing preclinical testing,
inhibited constitutive receptor phosphorylation as well as
downstream signaling through MEK1/2 and Akt. These
changes inhibited proliferation and, in some AML cell lines,
induced apoptosis at submicromolar concentrations. Likewise, BMS-536924 inhibited leukemic colony formation in
CD34+ clinical AML samples in vitro. Collectively, these results
not only indicate that expression of IGF1R and IR isoform A is
common in AML but also show that interruption of signaling
from these receptors inhibits proliferation in clinical AML
isolates. Accordingly, further investigation of IGF1R/IR axis as
a potential therapeutic target in AML appears warranted.

Introduction
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway plays an
important role in various cellular processes, including proliferation
and differentiation (1–3). Components of this pathway include the
ligands IGF1 and IGF2, which exhibit a high degree of sequence
homology to insulin; IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), which contains an
extracellular domain that binds both IGFs and an intracellular
tyrosine kinase domain that initiates signaling; and IGF2 receptor,
which lacks a tyrosine kinase domain and binds IGF2 without
initiating signal transduction (1, 3, 4).
The IGF1R and insulin receptor (IR) pathways are closely related.
IGF1R and IR exhibit extensive sequence similarity, including

sequence identity in their ATP-binding clefts and at residues that
contact the peptide ligands in their binding sites as well as 84%
homology in the kinase domain (5). In both cases, ligand binding
results in a conformational change that leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase domain; increased
phosphorylation of the receptor substrates Shc, IRS-1 and IRS-2;
and activation of the same downstream signaling cascades,
including the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways (3–5). Indeed, IGF1R and IR are so
similar that IGF1R and IR isoform A (IR-A), a splice variant that is
overexpressed in certain carcinomas, can heterodimerize to form
hybrid receptors that signal after binding IGF1, IGF2, or insulin at
physiologic levels (6). Moreover, IR-A homodimers can bind IGF2
and, to a lesser extent, IGF1 (7–9), suggesting that proliferative
IGF signaling can occur through IGF1R homodimers, IGF1R/IR-A
heterodimers, and IR-A homodimers (6, 9). In contrast, hybrid
receptors containing IGF1R and IR isoform B are orders of
magnitude less sensitive to IGF2 and insulin (6).
Uncontrolled IGF1R signaling, which stimulates proliferation
and protects cells from apoptosis (1, 3, 4, 10), has been implicated
in the development and maintenance of various neoplasms (1, 3, 4,
11–13). As a result, the IGF1/IGF1R axis has become a target for
anticancer drug development. Agents currently undergoing preclinical or clinical testing include neutralizing IGF1 antibodies,
antagonistic IGF1R antibodies, and small-molecule IGF1R tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (3, 4, 10, 14). In view of signaling by IGF1R/IR-A
hybrids (6) and IR-A homodimers (7–9), as well as the high
sequence homology of IGF1R and IR, there has also been recent
interest in dual-receptor inhibitors. The dual IGF1R/IR inhibitor
BMS-554417 exhibited antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity
in vitro and in vivo with modest effects on glucose tolerance (15).
BMS-536924 (1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl-1H-pyridin-2-one), which is
used in the present work, is likewise an ATP-competitive inhibitor
of IGF1R and IR that has shown activity against neoplastically
transformed cell lines (16, 17).
Although the role of the IGF1 system has been extensively
investigated in various solid tumors, less is known about the role of
IGF1R and IR in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Earlier
reports showed that IGF1 enhances colony formation by committed normal myeloid and erythroid progenitors (18, 19), but more
primitive CD34+ normal progenitors lack IGF1R expression and are
resistant to IGF1R down-regulation (20). In addition, IGF1
enhances proliferation of human AML cell lines (21–24) and
clonogenic growth of AML progenitors in vitro (25–27). More
recently, expression of IR (28) as well as IGF1R (28, 29) was shown
in AML cell lines and a handful of primary AML specimens. In

addition, it was reported that insulin and IGF1 both enhanced the
proliferation of AML cells and that down-regulation of either IR or
IGFR modestly diminished proliferation of U937 cells (28), raising
the possibility that IR signaling also contributes to survival and
proliferation of AML cells. To build on these results, the present
studies were designed to determine the frequency of IGF1R and IR
expression in a larger series of AML specimens, establish the
identity of the IR splice form expressed in AML cell lines and
clinical specimens, and assess the effect of the dual IGF1R/IR
inhibitor BMS-536924 on AML cell lines and clinical AML
specimens in vitro.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Antibodies that recognize the h-chains of IR (products 3020
and 3025) and IGF1R (product 3027) as well as phospho-Tyr1131-IGF1R and
phospho-Tyr1146-IR (product 3021), phospho-Ser473-Akt, Akt, phospho–
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and ERK1/2 were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology. Oligonucleotides were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies. MTS and phenazine methosulfate were
purchased from Promega and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. All other
reagents were obtained as described previously (30, 31).
Tissue culture. AML lines were propagated at densities of <1  106 cells/
mL in medium containing 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine. HL-60 cells (American Type
Culture Collection), ML-1 cells (Michael Kastan, St. Jude Children’s
Hospital), and K562 cells (Robert Abraham, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) were
maintained in medium A [RPMI 1640 with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum]. U937 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
maintained in medium A supplemented with 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4),
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 4.5 g/L glucose
(medium B). All experiments with BMS-536924 were performed in these
serum-containing medium.
MTS assay. Log-phase cells were sedimented at 100  g for 5 min,
washed once in serum-free media, and resuspended in serum-free medium.
Aliquots containing f5  104 cells in 120 AL were incubated at 37jC with
varying concentrations of insulin for 24 to 72 h. Alternatively, cells in
medium A or medium B containing fetal bovine serum were incubated
with varying concentrations of BMS-536924 for 5 days. After reaction with
MTS and phenazine methosulfate as instructed by the suppliers, plates
were incubated for 3 to 6 h to obtain an absorbance of >0.5 at 490 nm in
control samples.
Detection of apoptosis. Flow cytometry for DNA content (31, 32) and
fluorescence microscopy for apoptotic nuclear morphologic changes (33)
were performed as described (31, 33, 34).
Clonogenic assays. Aliquots containing 500 to 1,000 HL-60 or U937
cells were plated in gridded 35-mm plates in the medium of Pike and
Robinson (35) containing 0.3% (w/v) agar and the indicated concentrations of BMS-536924. After incubation for 10 to 14 days, colonies
containing z50 cells were counted. Colony-forming assays in MCF-7 cells
were performed as described (30).
Leukemia samples. Under the aegis of institutional review board–
approved protocols, marrow samples were acquired from consenting
patients with newly diagnosed AML before induction therapy. Mononuclear
cells were isolated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients, washed with RPMI 1640,
and resuspended at 1.5  106/mL in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
containing 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100
Ag/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine (medium C). Aliquots
containing 600,000 cells were plated in gridded 35-mm culture dishes
containing increasing BMS-536924 concentrations in growth factor–
containing Methocult methylcellulose medium (StemCell Technologies),
incubated for 14 days, and scored at 25 magnification according to
published morphologic criteria (36).
Reverse transcription-PCR. After total RNA was isolated using a
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), cDNAs were synthesized using a SuperScript III
First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) following the supplier’s instructions.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

PCRs (50 AL) were completed using 3 AL cDNA product (5 AL for IR
amplification), Promega Master Mix PCR reagents, and the primers listed in
Supplementary Table S1. Amplification for IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IRS-2, and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase involved a three-step program:
95jC for 60 s; 35 cycles of 95jC for 30 s, 55jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 60 s; and
72jC for 7 min. Amplification of IR and IRS-1 was accomplished by nested
PCR using the outer primers according to the conditions described above
and then reamplifying 2% of the first PCR using the inner primers listed in
Supplementary Table S1. Alternatively, amplification of IR nucleotides 2,230
to 2,867, a region that contains exon 11 in isoform B but not isoform A, was
completed using primers and conditions specified by Pandini and
colleagues (6). Products were electrophoresed on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel
containing 0.5 Ag/mL ethidium bromide in 1 TAE buffer [30.7 mmol/L
Tris, 20 mmol/L sodium acetate, and 1 mmol/L EDTA], visualized on a UV
transilluminator, excised, and sequenced using automated dye terminator
technology.
Immunoprecipitation. All steps were performed at 4jC. Log-phase cells
were washed twice in PBS and lysed by incubation for 20 min in buffer
consisting of 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v)
glycerol, 5 mmol/L MgSO4, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin,
1% (w/v) thiodiglycol, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. After lysates were
sedimented at 16,000  g for 5 min, supernatants were incubated for 16 h
with rabbit monoclonal anti-IR or polyclonal anti-IGF1R on an end-overend shaker. After addition of 50 AL of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein
A-Sepharose beads, samples were incubated for an additional 2 h.
Receptor-antibody complexes were recovered by sedimentation at
4,000  g for 1 min, washed four times with wash buffer [150 mmol/L
NaCl, 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton
X-100, 1% (w/v) thiodiglycol, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate],
eluted in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed
by immunoblotting.
Immunoblotting. Whole-cell lysates were prepared from cell lines or
clinical AML samples as described previously (37). Aliquots were
resuspended in SDS sample buffer at 5 mg protein/mL (assayed by the
bicinchoninic acid method), separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies as described (38).

Results
IGF1R, IR-A, and IGF1 are expressed in AML cell lines. To
assess expression of IGF1R and IR in human AML cells, reverse
transcription-PCR and immunoblotting were performed using RNA
and protein, respectively, from the HL-60, U937, and ML-1 human
AML cell lines. As indicated in Fig. 1A, reverse transcription-PCR
readily detected message encoding IGF1R, IR, and the downstream
signaling molecules IRS-1 and IRS-2 in each line. Sequencing
demonstrated that the IR transcript in all three AML lines
corresponds to isoform A (Fig. 1A, right; and data not shown), an
isoform that can bind IGF1 and IGF2 (7–9) as well as alter the
ligand specificity of IGF1R (6). Immunoblotting (Fig. 1B) likewise
demonstrated signals for IGF1R and IR at f100 kDa, the expected
molecular weight for the mature h chain of each receptor, in all
three lines. Importantly, IGF1R was expressed at high levels in U937
and ML-1 cells, whereas IR was expressed at higher levels in HL-60.
Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting confirmed the
association of a portion of the total IR with IGF1R in HL-60 and
U937 cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 4), suggesting the presence of
IGF1R/IR-A heterodimers as well as IR-A homodimers depending
on the cell line. Analysis using affinity-purified antibodies that
recognize a conserved autophosphorylation site on IGF1R and IR
also indicated that one or both receptors were phosphorylated
under normal growth conditions (Fig. 1B and C, top). As indicated in

Insulin Receptor A and IGF1R in AML

Figure 1. IGF1R, IR, IGF1, and IGF2 expression in AML cell lines. A, cDNA was amplified using primers specific for the h-chains of IGF1R and IR as well as IRS-1,
IRS-2, and, as a control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH ). PCR products were photographed under UV illumination (left) and sequenced to
confirm their identities. Right, chromatograms obtained when IR cDNAs from HL-60 (top ) and MDA-MB-468 cells (bottom ) were sequenced across the splice junction
(dashed line ) between exons 12 and 11. Predicted sequences of isoforms A and B are shown above chromatograms. Arrows, nucleotides unique to the A isoform.
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, which express approximately equal amounts of both isoforms, served as a positive control for detection of both isoforms when
present. B, whole-cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize the indicated antigens. Heat shock protein
90 (Hsp90 ) served as a loading control. Numbers at left and in subsequent figures indicate molecular weight markers in kDa. C, lysates from 2.5  107 log-phase
HL-60 cells (lanes 1 and 2 ), U937 cells (lanes 3 and 4), or ML-1 cells (lanes 5 and 6) were prepared in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors
and subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-IR (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or polyclonal anti-IGF1R antibodies (lanes 2, 4 , and 6 ) followed by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting with reagents that recognize the indicated antigens. D, cDNA was amplified using primers specific for IGF1 and IGF2. K562 cells served as a
positive control for IGF2 expression.

Fig. 1D, message for IGF1 was detectable in HL-60 cells but not in
the U937 or ML-1 cell lines. IGF2 mRNA was not detectable in any
of the three AML lines.
To determine whether these receptors are functional, cells were
treated with IGF1, IGF2, or insulin. Activating phosphorylations of
ERK and Akt were readily observed within 5 min after addition of
10 nmol/L IGF1 or 13 nmol/L IGF2 (Fig. 2A), indicating that the
IGF1R signals in response to physiologic ligand concentrations.
Importantly, pathway activation was also observed within <1 min
after insulin addition, suggesting that the IR expressed in these
cells can signal (Fig. 2B). In further experiments, insulin at
concentrations as low as 10 ng/mL (1.6 nmol/L) enhanced the
reduction of MTS, a common assay of viable cell mass, after
serum deprivation (Fig. 2C). The extent of this effect varied with
the cell line, being highest in HL-60 cells (Fig. 2C). Because of
concern that the MTS assay might reflect changes in glucose
metabolism rather than cell viability, cell survival was also
determined when cells were incubated with insulin, the IGF1

derivative LR-3, or IGF2 under serum-free conditions. As
indicated in Fig. 2D for U937 cells, cell division continued over
the first 24 h after serum withdrawal, reflecting completion of the
cell cycle in the population that had passed the restriction point.
Although cells subsequently died, LR-3 and particularly IGF2
increased survival relative to diluent-treated cells. This effect was
evident on day 3 and, to a lesser extent, day 4.
Collectively, the results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate
that human AML cell lines synthesize IR-A as well as IGF1R,
that IGF1R/IR-A heterodimers can be detected in some of
these cells, and that these receptors can signal under normal
growth conditions.
BMS-536924 inhibits receptor signaling and proliferation in
AML cell lines. In light of the preceding results, we next assessed
the effect of the dual IGF1R/IR inhibitor BMS-536924 (16) on
receptor autophosphorylation and downstream signaling. As
illustrated in Fig. 3A for ML-1 cells, submicromolar BMS-536924
concentrations induced a dose-dependent decrease in receptor

phosphorylation that was accompanied by inhibition of Akt and, to
a lesser extent, ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, IGF1R
levels increased in response to BMS-536924, possibly reflecting a
feedback pathway.

Subsequent experiments assessed the effect of BMS-536924 on
AML cell proliferation and viability. When HL-60, U937, or ML-1
cells were incubated with BMS-536924 for 5 days, a dose-dependent
decrease in viable cell mass was observed (B-D), with mean IC50

Insulin Receptor A and IGF1R in AML

values ranging from 360 F 130 nmol/L (mean F SD, n = 3) for
ML-1 cells to 1,800 F 630 nmol/L for U937. Because this decrease
can reflect either diminished proliferation or increased apoptosis,
cells were also treated with BMS-536924 and subjected to flow
cytometry. As illustrated in Fig. 4A for ML-1 cells, BMS-536924
induced readily apparent G1 arrest. In addition, cells with
‘‘subdiploid’’ DNA content accumulated (Fig. 4A-D), particularly
in ML-1 cultures. Hoechst staining also showed the presence of
cells with fragmented nuclei after exposure to BMS-536924 for
5 days (Fig. 4D, inset), confirming the induction of apoptosis.
To provide an alternative method for assessing the cumulative
effects of BMS-536924, clonogenic assays were performed using
HL-60 and U937 cells, the two lines that form colonies in soft agar.
BMS-536924 diminished colony formation in both cell lines, with
IC50 values of 340 F 50 nmol/L (mean F SD, n = 3) in HL-60 cells
and <80 nmol/L (n = 3) in U937 cells (Fig. 5A and B). In
comparison, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which are considered an
IGF1–dependent solid tumor line (17, 39–41), exhibited an IC50 of
500 F 100 nmol/L (n = 3) in colony-forming assays (Fig. 5C),
indicating that BMS-536924 induces long-term antiproliferative
effects in HL-60 and U937 cells at concentrations similar to those
that inhibit proliferation of IGF1–dependent solid tumor cell lines.
Analysis of primary AML specimens. In view of the effects of
BMS-536924 on human AML cell lines, we next examined IGF1R,
IR, and IGF expression in clinical AML specimens. In a group of 21
pretreatment AML specimens (Fig. 6A and data not shown), mRNA
encoding IGF1R, IR, and IGF1 was detectable in 18 (86%) and
mRNA for IGF2 was detectable in 15 (71%). When the IR message

www.aacrjournals.org

from the 18 positive AML samples was sequenced, only message
encoding IR-A was detected (Fig. 6B and data not shown), as in the
AML cell lines (Fig. 1A). In further experiments, blasts from 29
pretreatment AML marrows encompassing all FAB subtypes were
examined by immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize IGF1R
and IR. Twenty-six of the 29 (90%) samples expressed IGF1R and 25
of 29 (86%) expressed IR at the protein level (Fig. 6C). Interestingly,
IGF1R and IR were readily detected by immunoblotting in samples
that contained low but detectable message levels (Fig. 6A, right),
suggesting a poor correlation between mRNA and protein for these
two receptors.
Because the majority of the leukemic marrow samples expressed
IGF1R and/or IR-A, we examined the effect of BMS-536924 on blast
cell proliferation using clonogenic assays. For these studies, nine
CD34+ AML samples were examined. As indicated in Fig. 6D, blast
cells in these specimens exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in
colony formation on exposure to BMS-536924, with IC50 values
ranging from 1 to 7 Amol/L.

Discussion
Results of the present study provide the first evidence that
human AML cells express exclusively isoform A, the proliferative
form of the IR. Additional experiments show that the dual IGF1R/
IR inhibitor BMS-536924 decreases autophosphorylation of its
target receptors, diminishes signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways,

and inhibits proliferation of AML cell lines and colony formation in
clinical AML samples. Collectively, these results identify the IGF1R/
IR axis as a possible contributor to AML cell survival and show the
potential utility of targeting both receptors in AML.
In earlier work, Tazzari and colleagues reported that IGF1
expression and IGF1R phosphorylation were increased in blast cells
at the time of relapse in four AML patients (29). Doepfner and
colleagues subsequently showed expression of IR in addition to
IGF1R in AML blasts (28). The present study extended these
observations by showing that both IR and IGF1R are expressed at
the protein and RNA levels in >80% of AML samples (Fig. 6A and
C). When primers that amplify across exon 11 of the IR (6) were
used, no exon 11 sequence was detected in any of the AML cell
lines (Fig. 1A) or clinical AML samples (Fig. 6A). In view of the
ability of IR-A to bind IGF1 and IGF2 directly (7–9) as well as
modify the ligand specificity of IGF1R (6), our demonstration that
isoform A is the predominant IR expressed in AML has potential
biological and therapeutic implications.
Previous studies have reported that the presence of IR-A not only
provides a high-affinity receptor for IGF2 (8) but also enhances the
ability of insulin and IGF2 to signal through IGF1R (6). Consistent
with these earlier reports, we observed that physiologic concentrations of IGF1, IGF2, or insulin activated the mitogen-activated
protein kinase and Akt pathways (Fig. 2A and B). These ligands
also enhanced AML cell survival under serum-free conditions
(Fig. 2C and D). The effects of insulin were more pronounced in
HL-60 cells, which expressed the highest amount of IR, whereas the
effects of LR-3 and IGF2 were higher in U937 cells, which express
more IGF1R (Figs. 1 and 2; data not shown).
Further studies demonstrated message for IGF1 and/or IGF2 in
70% to 90% of specimens from newly diagnosed AML patients
(Fig. 6A). Although the present study was not designed to rule out

a possible contribution to these signals from small numbers of
contaminating stromal cells, the presence of IGF1 and/or IGF2
message in a variety of AML lines, including HL-60, K562, THP.1,
KG1a, and HEL (Fig. 1D; data not shown), indicates that myeloid
cells can express these ligands. Coupled with recent reports that
these ligands are secreted by clinical AML samples (28, 42), these
results raise the possibility of an autocrine or paracrine pathway
involving IGF1R and IR-A in AML. In view of the ability of IGF1R
and IR-A ligands to activate downstream signaling (Fig. 2A and
B), such a pathway might contribute to the previously described
constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(43–45) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways (46–48) in
clinical AML specimens.
In further experiments, BMS-536924, an example of a new drug
class that inhibits IGF1R and IR almost equally (15, 16), diminished
proliferation at concentrations as low as 200 nmol/L (Fig. 3B-D)
and induced apoptosis in susceptible AML lines (Fig. 4). Moreover,
BMS-536924 inhibited colony formation in CD34+ clinical AML
samples by as much as 98% (Fig. 6D). There was, however,
variability among clinical samples as indicated by the fact that
10 Amol/L BMS-536924 inhibited colony formation by 60% to 98%
(Fig. 6D).
This variability requires further investigation. No clear-cut
correlation between different AML subtypes and BMS-536924
sensitivity is evident from the present studies, although the sample
size was extremely small. On the other hand, we have observed
differences in expression of some of the proteins that might be
predicted to affect sensitivity, including IGF1R, IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2
(Fig. 6C; data not shown). Because expression of these polypeptides
in the total blast population might not reflect levels in the cells that
form colonies, it will be important to examine these polypeptides in
specific AML subpopulations in the future. Other factors that might

Insulin Receptor A and IGF1R in AML

Figure 5. BMS-536924 inhibits colony formation in AML cell lines. Log-phase HL-60 (A), U937 (B ), or MCF-7 (C) cells were plated in medium containing 0.3%
agar and varying concentrations of BMS-536924 (A and B) or allowed to adhere to tissue culture plates and continuously exposed to BMS-536924 (C ). After a 10- to
14-d incubation, colonies were counted. Points, mean of quadruplicate samples; bars, SD.

contribute to sensitivity differences include variability in expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (15) or the transporter
ABCG2, which has recently been shown to efflux BMS-536924 (49).
Finally, it is conceivable that the ability or inability of cells to up-

regulate IGF1R and/or IR upon pathway inhibition might contribute
to the variability. Future experiments will need to determine
whether the BMS-536924-induced IGF1R up-regulation observed
in Fig. 3A reflects increased gene expression, message stabilization,

and/or post-translational changes, whether similar effects are
observed in clinical leukemia specimens, and whether this upregulation affects drug sensitivity.
Additional studies are also required to determine whether a dual
IGF1R/IR inhibitor such as BMS-536924 exhibits selectivity for
AML compared with normal progenitors. It is known that primitive
CD34+ normal progenitors lack IGF1R expression and are resistant
to IGF1R down-regulation (20). Although it has been suggested that
IR signaling might provide a survival signal for normal CD34+ cells
(50), the paucity of marrow toxicity in mice treated with the IGF1R/
IR inhibitor BMS-554417 (15), coupled with the limited effects of
NVP-AEW541 on normal human CD34+ progenitors (28, 29) at
concentrations that inhibit IR in addition to IGF1R, suggests that
effects of dual IGF1R/IR inhibition on normal myeloid progenitors
will be modest.
In summary, the present results not only show that IR-A, like
IGF1R, is widely expressed in AML cell lines and clinical samples,
but also show that the dual IGF1R/IR inhibitor BMS-536924

induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and profoundly inhibits colony
formation in a subset of AML samples in vitro. Based on these
results, further preclinical and possible clinical testing of therapies
that simultaneously target IGF1R and IR in AML appear warranted.
