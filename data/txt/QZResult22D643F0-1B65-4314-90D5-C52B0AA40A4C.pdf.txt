Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mutations in phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) or genomic alterations in the
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-signalling pathway are the most common genetic alterations
reported in human prostate cancer1–4. However, the precise mechanism underlying how indolent
tumours with PTEN alterations acquire meta-static potential remaisns poorly understood. Recent
studies suggest that upregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling triggered by
PTEN loss will form a growth barrier as a defence mechanism to constrain prostate cancer
progression5, underscoring that TGF-β signalling might represent a pre-invasive checkpoint to
prevent PTEN-mediated prostate tumorigenesis. Here we show that COUP transcription factor II
(COUP-TFII, also known as NR2F2)6–9, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, serves as
a key regulator to inhibit SMAD4-dependent transcription, and consequently overrides the TGF-β-

dependent checkpoint for PTEN-null indolent tumours. Overexpression of COUP-TFII in the
mouse prostate epithelium cooperates with PTEN deletion to augment malignant progression and
produce an aggressive metastasis-prone tumour. The functional counteraction between COUPTFII and SMAD4 is reinforced by genetically engineered mouse models in which conditional loss
of SMAD4 diminishes the inhibitory effects elicited by COUP-TFII ablation. The biological
significance of COUP-TFII in prostate carcinogenesis is substantiated by patient sample analysis,
in which COUP-TFII expression or activity is tightly correlated with tumour recurrence and
disease progression, whereas it is inversely associated with TGF-β signalling. These findings
reveal that the destruction of the TGF-β-dependent barrier by COUP-TFII is crucial for the
progression of PTEN-mutant prostate cancer into a life-threatening disease, and supports
COUPTFII as a potential drug target for the intervention of metastatic human prostate cancer.

COUP-TFII is known to promote tumour angiogenesis through its function in the tumour
microenvironment10,11, but its role in tumour cells remains undefined. Consistent with
aberrant expression of COUP-TFII reported in various tumours12–17, Oncomine expression
analysis revealed higher COUP-TFII expression in prostate tumour cells and in metastatic
prostate cancer than in primary prostate cancer12,13 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To assess the
clinical relevance of COUP-TFII in human prostate cancer, we stained for COUP-TFII in a
tumour tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of 407 patient specimens. Examination of
clinical prostate specimens showed higher levels of COUP-TFII expression in prostate
tumour cells in comparison to the adjacent normal prostate epithelium (Supplementary Fig.
1b). As summarized in Fig. 1a, approximately 60% of human prostate cancer specimens
exhibited intermediate to intense nuclear COUP-TFII staining, whereas only 5% of normal
prostate epithelial cells stained positive for COUP-TFII. Further correlation studies indicated
that COUP-TFII expression in tumour cells significantly associated with pathological
predictors of human prostate cancer aggressiveness (Supplementary Table 1). Most
importantly, univariate analysis indicated that COUP-TFII expression levels in prostate
tumour cells could serve as a predictor to stratify risk of recurrence in patients; patients
bearing higher levels of COUP-TFII expression showed earlier recurrence after radical
prostatectomy (Fig. 1b). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that tumour
recurrence was sensitive to gradual increases of COUP-TFII expression levels, as reflected
by the increasing hazard ratios, from 1.5 to 1.8 and 2.5.

These results prompted us to use genetically engineered mouse models to determine the
causal role of COUP-TFII in prostate tumori-genesis. As such, we engineered mice
containing PB-Cre (the Cre gene under control of the prostate-specific probasin promoter)18
and conditional knockout alleles of Pten3 and/or COUP-TFII (also known as Nr2f2)7,
hereafter referred to as PtenPC–/– and PtenPC–/–; COUPTFIIPC–/– mice, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). PTEN-null mice lacking COUP-TFII exhibited a significant
reduction in prostate weight (Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting a positive role for
COUPTFII in driving prostate tumorigenesis. Histopathological analysis of the entire animal
cohort showed that loss of COUP-TFII compromised prostate tumour progression, as
reflected by the arrest of tumours at the hyperplastic or low-grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN) stage at 5 months of age, whereas tumours from PtenPC–/– mice already
advanced to high-grade PIN or adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 2d). The

normal prostatic histology in COUP-TFIIPC–/– mice (Supplementary Fig. 2e) argued against
a possibility that it was due to a developmental defect. Moreover, loss of COUP-TFII
attenuated the proliferation advantage elicited by Pten loss, whereas the levels of
angiogenesis remained similar and thus is unlikely to have contributed to the restriction of
prostate tumorigenesis (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given that COUP-TFII was further upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer, and its higher
expression correlated with a worse clinical outcome, we sought to determine whether
overexpression of COUPTFII in Pten-null tumours would exacerbate prostate tumorigenesis.
As such, we generated an inducible COUP-TFII overexpression mouse, COUP-TFIIOE/+
(Fig. 2a), that allows constitutive COUP-TFII expression in the prostate epithelium. During
12 months of follow-up, COUP-TFIIOE/+ mice exhibited normal prostatic histology
(Supplementary Fig. 3a), indicating that COUP-TFII by itself is not sufficient to initiate
prostate neoplasia, and that cooperating oncogenic lesions are required. Indeed,
overexpression of COUP-TFII in a Pten-heterozygous background resulted in a rapid
acceleration of tumour progression, with overt and high penetrance PIN starting at 4 months
of age and progressing to high-grade PIN or adenocarcinoma by 12 months (Fig. 2b). These
data demonstrate that COUP-TFII enables rapid disease progression from preneoplastic
prostatic epithelium.

Next, we determined whether prostate-specific overexpression of COUP-TFII in a Pten-null
background would produce a metastasis-prone cancer. By 24 weeks of age, PtenPC–/–;
COUP-TFIIOE/+ mice developed highly aggressive carcinoma with an altered stroma, as
evidenced by the attenuation or loss of the periglandular smooth muscle layer and androgen
receptor (AR)-positive tumour cells invading into the stroma (Fig. 2c), in which subsets of
invasive tumour cells exhibited epithelial–mesenchymal transition (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Molecular pathological analysis of prostate-cancer-bearing PtenPC–/–; COUP-TFIIOE/+ mice
also showed a metastatic spread of AR-positive tumour nodules to lumbar lymph nodes in
13 out of 16 cases, and lung meta-stasis in 4 out of 16 cases (Fig. 2d). By contrast, PtenPC–/–
mice only showed a modest metastatic phenotype2–4. Even with more aggressive tumour
phenotypes, angiogenesis was not altered whereas proliferation was enhanced after COUPTFII overexpression (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Figs 3d, e and 4). Collectively, COUP-TFII
overexpression enhances the full spectrum of prostate cancer development, leading to
aggressive metastasis in Pten-null tumours.
To determine how COUP-TFII affects tumorigenesis, we conducted a transcriptome
comparison using COUP-TFII-depleted PC3 cells. Unbiased ingenuity pathway analysis
indicated that COUP-TFII was crucial for the growth of human prostate cancer cells, an
observation reinforced by anchorage-independent growth assays and cell proliferation/
viability tests (MTT assay) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Further gene-set enrichment analysis
and comparison with our gene expression profile to a defined TGF-β response signature19
indicated a global enrichment of TGF-β-induced genes in the absence of COUP-TFII (Fig.
3a and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Given that TGF-β signalling is crucial for prostate cancer
progression5,20, we examined whether COUP-TFII potentiated prostate tumorigenesis
through TGF-β signalling. In human prostate cancer cells, COUP-TFII served as a
transcriptional inhibitor of TGF-β signalling (Supplementary Fig. 6b–d). Knockdown of

COUP-TFII in PC3 cells substantially altered p21, p15 and cyclin D1 expression in response
to TGF-β stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Protein levels of p21 were also increased
without TGF-β stimulation, presumably owing to autocrine TGF-β signalling in PC3 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 6f).
We postulated that overexpression of COUP-TFII enabled the indolent Pten-null tumours to
acquire metastatic potential through the destruction of a TGF-β-induced growth barrier.
Indeed, in PtenPC–/–; COUP-TFIIOE/+ mice, the TGF-β-induced growth barrier was
significantly attenuated after increased COUP-TFII expression (Fig. 3b). Overexpression of
COUP-TFII profoundly neutralized oncogene-induced senescence, as judged by the
reduction of senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining (Supplementary Fig. 6g),
whereas ablation of COUP-TFII in Pten-null mice enhanced the acquisition of hyperactivity
of TGF-β signalling and a marked induction in cellular senescence. Furthermore, the clinical
relevance between COUPTFII levels and TGF-β signalling activities was established by a
significant correlation between COUP-TFII and p21/cyclin D1 expression in prostate
tumours, but not in normal prostate epithelium counterparts, in a cohort of 36 patients with
highly aggressive prostate cancer (Fig. 3c).

Next, we extended our findings by querying the gene expression profiling data set
GSE10645 (ref. 21) that contains 596 primary human tumours with prostate cancer-specific
death information, to complement our TMA results. Using gene expression profiles obtained
in PC3 cells, we found a total of 80 COUP-TFII-regulated genes represented in GSE10645
(Methods, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 2); the genes were used to score
each of the human tumours for COUP-TFII activity. We observed distinct differences in the
time to prostate-cancer-specific death, although no differences in the time to prostatespecific antigen (PSA) recurrence, among the patients with higher versus lower COUP-TFII
activity (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 3–5). Multivariate Cox model analysis indicated
that the PTEN, SMAD4, p21, cyclin D1 and COUP-TFII signature (Methods) all
independently provided predictive power to stratify patients into high-and low-risk groups
(Fig. 3e). Plotting the combined transcript levels of PTEN, SMAD4, p21 and cyclin D1
together with the higher COUP-TFII signature in prostatectomies increased the predictive
power from that of either gene set alone (Fig. 3f), illustrating a significant genetic
cooperation between COUP-TFII and TGF-β signalling in PTEN-null human prostate
cancer tumours.
Because depletion of COUP-TFII failed to affect the levels of SMAD2/3/4, the receptors or
the activated form of phosphorylated-SMAD2/3 (Supplementary Fig. 8), we investigated
whether COUPTFII could interact directly with any of these SMAD proteins. Indeed,
COUP-TFII strongly associated with SMAD4 in cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c) and in
patient tumour specimens (Fig. 4a). Overexpression of mutant COUP-TFII-M2, which was
unable to associate with SMAD4, failed to inhibit TGF-β signalling, indicating that the
COUPTFII–SMAD4 interaction was essential for the COUP-TFII effects on TGF-β
signalling (Supplementary Fig. 9d–f). Mechanistically, our data indicated that COUP-TFII
sequestered SMAD4 from binding to TGF-β-target gene promoters in cells (Supplementary
Fig. 10) and in tumours containing higher levels of COUP-TFII (Fig. 4b).

As supporting evidence forthe counteraction between COUP-TFIIand SMAD4, knockdown
of SMAD4 in PC3 cells alleviated the proliferative defects exerted by COUP-TFII depletion
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Furthermore, we used a SMAD4 conditional knockout mouse22 to
examine the tumour spectrum in PtenPC–/–; COUP-TFIIPC–/– and PtenPC–/–; COUPTFIIOE/+ mice. Compared with hyperplasia or low-grade PIN lesions observed in 5-monthold PtenPC–/–; COUP-TFIIPC–/– mice, ablation of SMAD4 in COUP-TFII-null mice restored
the full spectrum of tumour development as evidenced by the abundance of Ki67-labelled
nuclei, the appearance of microinvasive tumours and the similar incidences of lymph node
metastasis between PtenPC–/–; Smad4PC–/– and PtenPC–/–; COUP-TFIIPC–/–; Smad4PC–/–
mice (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Figs 12–14). Moreover, overexpression of COUP-TFII
in PtenPC–/–; Smad4PC–/– mice did not further aggravate the invasive phenotypes displayed
by the PtenPC–/–; Smad4PC–/– mice (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Figs 12–14).
In summary, our findings highlight a crucial role for COUP-TFII in driving full malignant
progression of PTEN-null prostate tumorigenesis by counteracting TGF-β negative feedback
signalling (Fig. 4e). As COUP-TFII is a member of the nuclear receptor family, the activity
of which can be regulated by small molecules23, our studies provide a potential new drug
target for the intervention of metastatic human prostate cancer.

METHODS
Immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tissue microarrays used in this study were described previously24,25. Samples were
procured from radical prostatectomies of 416 patients, who received no adjuvant therapy
such as radiation or hormonal therapy. Other patient characteristics were as described
previously24–26. Immunohistochemical analyses were done as described24–26 using a
specific anti-COUP-TFII antibody (Perseus Proteomics). Samples were scanned using a
Bliss automated slide scanner to generate high-resolution digital images. The expression of
COUP-TFII protein was scored and quantified as described previously24,25. In brief, the
slides were digitized and nuclear COUP-TFII protein expression was scored and quantified
based on a multiplicative index of the average staining intensity (0–3) and extent of staining
(0–3) in the cores, yielding a 10-point staining index that ranged from 0 (no staining) to 9
(extensive, strong staining). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on RNAs isolated
from patients with prostate cancer (n = 36) undergoing a radical prostatectomy for clinically
localized prostate cancer with clinical characteristics as previously described25. The tissues
were <70% cancerous based on histopathological analysis.
Animal experiments
All experiments were approved by the Animal Center for Comparative Medicine at Baylor
College of Medicine. COUP-TFIIflox/flox mice7 were previously generated by our laboratory,
and COUP-TFIIOE/+ mice were generated by our group using an approach as previously
described27. Ptenflox/flox mice3 were obtained from H. Wu. The ARR2PB-Cre (PB-Cre)
transgenic mice28 were from F. Wang. The Smad4flox/flox mice22 were from E. J. Robertson.
PB-Cre, COUP-TFIIflox/flox, COUP-TFIIOE/+ and Ptenflox/flox mice were backcrossed with
C57BL/6 mice for at least five generations, and maintained according to the National

compound mice were then crossed with PBCre mice for conditional knockout or
overexpression of COUP-TFII in the prostate epithelium.
Expression plasmids and siRNA
The full-length human COUP-TFII cDNA was cloned into pMSCV-puro/neo (Clontech),
pcDNA5 (Flag tag) (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3.1 (Myc tag) (Invitrogen) to generate COUPTFII expression plasmids. Overlapping PCR with primers was used to generate Flag-COUPTFII-M1 and M2 constructs, which are inserted in the KPNI/NheI sites of pcDNA5.
Expression plasmids for epitope-tagged SMAD2/3/4, glutathione S-transferase (GST)SMAD4 and the SMAD-binding element (SBE)-Luc reporter were described previously29.
COUP-TFII-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were generated previously30. In
brief, the shRNA for COUP-TFII (5′ -AGGTAACGTGA TTGATTCAGTATCTTA-3′ and
5′ -AGCTCTTGCTTCGTCTCCC-3′) was cloned into pSUPER.retro (OligoEngine).
SMART pool or single siRNA duplexes targeting COUP-TFII, Smad4 and control nontarget siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon.

Cell culture and reagents
PC3, VCaP, LNCaP and DU145 cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured in DMEM
or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RWPE-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured
with keratinocyte serum-free medium (K-SFM; Invitrogen) with bovine pituitary extract and
human recombinant EGF. Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes (40–80 nM) using
lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or Dharmacon transfection (Dharmacon) reagents according to
the manufacturer's instructions. COUP-TFII retrovirus was generated and transfected as
previously described1. In brief, cells were transduced with retrovirus and cultured with 2 mg
ml–1 puromycin or 400 mg ml–1 neomycin and the selection was stopped as soon as the noninfected control cells died off. Cell proliferation assay was performed using CellTiter 96
non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (MTT) kit (Promega) assay according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Results were calculated based on three independent experiments
and statistical significance was determined by two sided Student's t-test.

Luciferase reporter assay. Reporter assays were carried out as described11. In brief, 20–24 h
after transfection, cells were treated with TGF-β (10 ng ml–1) or SB431542 compound (20
nM) for 24 h. Cells were then collected for measurement of luciferase and b-galactosidase
activities. All assays were done in duplicate and all values were normalized for transfection
efficiency against β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase activity was determined with the
Promega luciferase assay kit. Results were quantified based on three independent
experiments and statistical significance was determined by two sided Student's t-test. P
values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
RNA isolation and qPCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol followed by the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) cleanup
and RQ1 RNase-free DNase set treatment (Promega) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA and Superscript II

(Applied Biosytems) were used for the reaction. Standard curves were generated by serial
dilution of a preparation of total RNA, and all messenger RNA quantities were normalized
against 18S RNA using ABI ribosomal RNA control reagents. The primers/probes used in
this study are as follows: COUP-TFII (Mm00772789_m1), AR (Hs00171172_m1),probasin
(Mm00444381_m1), NKX3.1 (Mm00440479_m1) and p21 (Hs00355782_m1). A Student's
t-test was used for statistical analysis of qPCR results, and P values less than 0.05 were
considered significant.
Histology and immunohistochemistry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The ventral, dorsolateral and anterior prostate lobes were dissected, fixed in 4%
formaldehyde in PBS for 24 h, processed and embedded in paraffin. Sections (7 μm) were
processed for H&E staining. Prostate hyperplasia is characterized by the proliferation of
luminal cells with no cytological atypia, but contain small foci with two or three layers of
cells. The PIN lesions were graded using the nomenclature and criteria developed
previously31. In brief, high-grade PIN is characterized by an intraglandular proliferation of
crowding cells with atypia, and cribriform formation or the development of multilayered
solid glandular structures. Invasive adenocarcinoma is characterized by the proliferation of
atypical cells that break the basal membrane and invade through the prostatic stroma. The
quantitative results of tumour progression are from two random slides of each mouse in a
total 10 pairs of the entire animal cohort. For immunohistochemistry, the slides were
processed using a citrate-buffer-based antigen retrieval and the avidin–biotin peroxidase
immunohistochemistry method. Sections were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich). Quantification of tumour malignancy was done as
follows: for Ki67 staining, positive cells were counted after imaging with a Zeiss Axioplan
microscope. Three random slides for each animal were counted. The proliferative rate was
determined by counting the proliferating cells (Ki67-positive) in a total of 100 cells, and the
statistical significance was determined with a two-tailed Student's t-test. For lymph node
metastasis, we performed CK8 or AR immunostaining in lymph nodes and recorded the
percentage of mice that were positive for CK8 or AR, which we considered as lymph node
metastasis. For invasive adenocarcinoma identification, we performed SMAα
immunostaining. If the gland or acini displayed a loss or breakdown of the continuous layer
of basal membrane (SMAα-positive) and the appearance of AR- or CK8-positive epithelial
cells invading into the stromal compartment, we consider it as microinvasive cancer. The
statistical significance between groups was determined with a two-tailed Fisher extract test.
Western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Total proteins were extracted from cells following standard protocol11. Nuclear proteins
were extracted using the NE-PER kit (Pierce). Protein concentration was measured using the
BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). The primary antibodies used in this study were
as follows: COUP-TFII (Perseus Proteomics), β-actin (Santa Cruz), phophorylated-H3 (Cell
Signaling), PCNA (Santa Cruz), phospho-AKT403 (Cell Signaling), pan AKT (Cell
Signaling), SMAD4 (Santa Cruz), p21 (BD), phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling), SMAD2
(Zymed), SMAD3 (Zymed), cyclin D1 (Sigma), p15 (Santa Cruz) and p53 (Santa Cruz).

as previously11 according to the protocol provided by Millipore. All the results are obtained
from three independent samples and statistical significance was determined by a two-sided
Student's t-test.
Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis
Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously3. Endogenous or epitopetagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by the appropriate antibody
affinity gel as indicated in the text and figure legends. After extensive washes,
immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in SDS sample loading buffer (Bio-Rad), separated
by SDS–PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Pierce) and detected in western blots with
appropriate primary antibodies coupled with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody by
chemiluminescence (Pierce).
GST fusion protein,in vitro protein binding and pull-down assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

GST fusion proteins were prepared using a commercial kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Target protein was pre-cleared with 5 μg of GST protein for 1 h and then incubated with 2
μg of various GST-fusion proteins for 2 h in the binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
120 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40). Proteins bound to GST-fusion proteins were
retrieved on glutathione–sepharose beads, separated by SDS–PAGE and examined by
western blot.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Nuclear proteins from PC3 cells treated with TGF-β for 1 h were extracted using NE-PER
kit (Pierce). Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the p21 SBE and its mutants
were annealed and end labelled with [γ-32P]ATP. The binding reactions were performed
and analysed on a 5% non-denaturing gel. For supershift studies, 1 μg of antibody against
SMAD4 (Santa Cruz) was preincubated for 20 min on ice, and DNA–protein complexes
were visualized by autoradiography.
Microarray analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For microarray analysis, total RNA was isolated from control and COUP-TFII-knockdown
PC3 cells. The Microarray Core at Baylor College of Medicine performed the microarray
hybridization with Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0. Gene information for all
probes was annotated based on ‘Human133_2.annot.csv’ downloaded from the Affymetrix
website. Raw data can be found in the GEO database as accession number GSE33182. The
list of significance was operated by setting a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold at level of
0.05. All differentially expressed gene lists generated as described above were further
analysed with the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis program (http://www.ingenuity.com/
index.html) to identify canonical pathways, and molecular and cellular functions enriched in
the related gene lists.

Clinical outcome analysis using GSE1064 data set

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We defined a gene expression signature for COUP-TFII activity using an external human
tumour data set and determined the correlation of COUP-TFII signature patterns with time
to prostate cancer-specific death in patients. The COUP-TFII gene signature was derived
from our own gene expression profile data set, of cells with or without COUP-TFII
knockdown (GEO accession GSE33182, from ref. 21). The COUPTFII gene signature
(defined using fold change>1.5 for each COUP-TFII siRNA sample profile versus each
control sample profile) consisted of 1,209 Affy probe sets (representing 829 unique genes)
induced with COUP-TFII knockdown and 1,328 probe sets (891 genes) repressed with
COUP-TFII knockdown (that is, the expression of 891 genes is induced by COUP-TFII, and
829 genes are repressed by COUP-TFII; Supplementary Data File). We used the previously
described ‘t-score’ metric32–36 to define the COUP-TFII gene signature within profiles from
an external human tumour data set (GEO accession GSE10645, using the ‘human cancer
panel’, or GPL5858 platform). In brief, the t-score was defined for each external profile as
the two-sided t-statistic comparing, within the profile, the average of the COUP-TFIIinduced genes with the average of the COUPTFII-repressed genes (genes within the
GSE10645 data set were first centred to standard deviations from the median). The
GSE10645 mRNA profile data set consisted of genes in a focused panel of 488 (which did
not include COUP-TFII mRNA itself), of which 80 were represented in our COUP-TFII
signature; for the 80 genes (47 induced by COUP-TFII siRNA and 33 repressed), the t-score
contrasted the patterns of the COUP-TFII-induced genes against those of the COUPTFIIrepressed genes, to derive a single value denoting coordinate expression of the two gene sets
(Supplementary Fig. 7). The univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, multivariate Cox
analysis, and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis were used to determine the correlation of
COUP-TFII signature with patient outcome as described below. Furthermore, we performed
a univariate analysis for each feature in the GSE10645 data set, and found the overall FDR
to be reasonable. Out of 502 total features represented on the focused array, 131 had a
univariate Cox P < 0.01, yielding an estimated FDR of (502 × 0.01)/131 = 3.8%. This
indicates that there are widespread correlation patterns with outcome represented in the data
set, similar to what one might find for other cancer profiling data sets. We also tested the
ability of a random gene signature to predict outcome, using simulation testing in which tscores were computed for each of 10,000 randomly generated signatures of the same gene
number as the actual signature; for 95.8% of the random signatures, the correlation with
worse patient outcome (as assessed by univariate Cox β value) did not exceed that for the
actual signature.

In addition to the GSE10645 (ref. 21) data set, we examined the signature in three other
gene array data sets of human prostate tumours, from refs 37–39. In these other data sets, the
outcome endpoint was PSA recurrence, whereas that for the GSE10645 data set was
prostate-cancer-specific death. For multiple human tumour gene array data sets including
GSE10645, we noted significant overlap between the genes repressed by COUP-TFII
knockdown and the genes associated with worse outcome (Supplementary Table 4).
However, when computing signature t-scores for each of the four data sets, the signature

correlated with worse outcome for GSE10645 (ref. 21) (using prostate-cancer-specific death
as the outcome measure) and ref. 37 data sets, but not with the refs 38 and 39 data sets, and
not with time to PSA recurrence in the ref. 37 data set (Supplementary Table 5). Therefore,
we conclude that the signature correlates with shorter time to prostate-cancer-specific death,
with time to recurrence event having a weaker association.
Analysis of the enrichment of TGF-β-induced genes in COUP-TFII-depleted PC3 cells
A one-sided Fisher's exact test determined the significance of gene overlap between our
COUP-TFII gene signature (as described above) and a previously generated gene signature
of TGF-β activity (as reported previously19). Both data sets were generated using the
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 platform; therefore, the mapping between the two gene signatures
was based on Affymetrix probe set identifier, with the gene population being the entire set
(~54,675) represented on the gene array.
Statistical analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All experiments were performed using 3–15 mice or three independent repeated experiments
from cells. Data are presented as mean and s.e.m. Spearman correlation coefficients were
used to evaluate the relationships between COUP-TFII and clinicopathological variables or
gene expression. The predictive value of COUP-TFII expression univariately with other
clinical and pathological variables was analysed using the Cox proportional hazards
regression model and the hazard ratio, and 95% confidence intervals were computed. The
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model with the five-gene signature was used to
estimate the coefficients of individual genes, which combined the five-gene expression
levels into an integrated risk score model defined. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for
different levels of COUP-TFII or COUP-TFII signature were also plotted. All analyses are
performed with statistical software SPSS 19.0 (IBM, SPSS Statistics) or WinStat for Excel
(R. Fitch software). Statistical significance was determined by a Student's t-test, Spearman
correlation coefficients test, log-rank test or Fisher's exact test. For all statistical tests, the
0.05 level of confidence (two-sided) was accepted for statistical significance.

in prostate tumorigenesis. PTEN inactivation drives prostate tumour initiation and
progression. However, it also elicits the activation of TGF-β signalling that induces cellular
senescence to constrain the indolent tumour from becoming aggressive. To develop
metastasis-prone tumours, alternative oncogenic signals stimulate COUP-TFII expression,
which counteracts the TGF-β-dependent checkpoint through direct association with
SMAD4. Thus, COUP-TFII serves as a crucial regulator that counteracts the TGF-βdependent growth barrier to enable indolent prostate cancer tumours to acquire metastatic
potential. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Data in b and c are mean and s.e.m.
