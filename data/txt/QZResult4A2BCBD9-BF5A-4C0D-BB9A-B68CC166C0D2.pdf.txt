BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of carboplatin in combination with
gemcitabine and irinotecan in patients with solid tumors.

METHODS. Patients with solid tumors who were not candidates for standard
chemotherapy received escalating doses of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and irinotecan.

RESULTS. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Two of 4 patients who received
carboplatin at an area under the curve (AUC) of 5 on Day 1 with gemcitabine
800 mg/m2 and irinotecan 80 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 developed DLT, along with
2 of 12 patients at the immediate-lower dose level: carboplatin at an AUC of 4 on
Day 1 with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 and irinotecan 80 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8.

unable to receive therapy on Day 8. Twenty-four patients developed grade 3 or 4
ble with the exception of 1 patient, who developed acute liver failure after
the fourth cycle of chemotherapy and died. Objective responses were observed
in 7 patients, including 5 patients who had small cell and neuroendocrine carcinomas.

CONCLUSIONS. Carboplatin in combination with gemcitabine and irinotecan was
feasible. However, compromise of single-agent doses of all 3 drugs was necessary
because of toxicity. Additional studies are warranted in patients with small cell
and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Cancer 2007;109:1413–9.

arboplatin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) is a platinum
coordination compound.1 It produces predominantly interstrand
DNA cross-links, an effect that is apparently cell cycle-nonspecific.
It is active broadly against various tumors in cell lines, including
ovarian, lung, pancreatic, and mammary carcinomas. Compared
with cisplatin, carboplatin has less nonhematologic toxicity,
although myelosuppression may be increased. When it is used in
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, carboplatin doses
at an area under the curve (AUC) of 5 to 6 are usually well tolerated.2 The United States Food and Drug Administration has

approved carboplatin for the treatment of ovarian
carcinoma, and carboplatin also has demonstrated
clinical activity in small cell and nonsmall cell lung
cancer.1
Gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN)
is a cytosine analogue that is metabolized intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active diphosphate and triphosphate nucleosides, which, when
incorporated into DNA, result in chain termination.
It exhibits cell-phase specificity, primarily killing cells
undergoing DNA synthesis.3 Preclinical activity has
been observed with gemcitabine in lung, breast, colon, ovarian, and head and neck cancers.4 Phase I
studies of weekly administration have established a
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 790 mg/m2 in
heavily pretreated patients and 1500 mg/m2 in
chemotherapy-naive patients.5 Common toxicities
from gemcitabine include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, fever, reversible elevation of
transaminases, and skin rash. Gemcitabine is approved in the United Stated for the treatment of pancreatic and nonsmall cell lung cancers, and clinical
responses have also been observed in patients with
breast, bladder, and small cell lung cancers.5
Irinotecan (CPT-11; Camptosar; Pfizer, NJ) is a
semisynthetic camptothecin derivative.6 Along with
its active metabolite SN-38, it inhibits the enzyme topoisomerase I, resulting in DNA strand breaks and
subsequent cytotoxicity. It has broad in vitro activity
in a wide range of human neoplasms, including colorectal, ovarian, breast, and small cell and nonsmall
cell lung cancers. In Phase I trials, the major toxicity
from irinotecan was diarrhea or a combination of diarrhea and neutropenia, with the MTD ranging from
80 mg/m2 to 125 mg/m2 on a weekly schedule.6 Irinotecan is approved for the treatment of colorectal
cancer and also is effective clinically in small cell
and nonsmall cell lung cancers. Based on the different mechanisms of action of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and irinotecan; on their demonstrated
anticancer activity both as single agents and as
doublets; and on their nonoverlapping dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT), a Phase I trial was designed to determine the MTD and DLT of this 3-drug combination
in patients with solid tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Patients with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a malignant solid tumor that was
refractory to standard chemotherapy or patients for
whom no established standard chemotherapy existed
were eligible to participate in the current study. Less

than or equal to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens
were allowed, and prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant
therapy counted as 1 of those regimens. Additional
eligibility criteria included the following: age 18
years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; an estimated life expectancy 2 weeks; the ability to comply with study
treatment and follow-up; adequate hematopoietic
function (absolute neutrophil count 1.5 3 109/L,
platelet count 100,000 3 106/L, and hemoglobin 9
g/L), hepatic function (total bilirubin <1.5, alanine
transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]
<3 times normal [ALT and AST could be elevated up
to 5 times normal in patients with known metastatic
disease in the liver]), and renal function (creatinine
2.0 mg/dL); childbearing potential either terminated by surgery, radiation, or menopause or attenuated by use of an approved contraceptive method
(intrauterine device, birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for 3 months after the trial; negative
urine pregnancy tests in women; no known central
nervous system metastasis or uncontrolled seizure
disorder; no intercurrent illness; no active infection;
and no second primary malignancy within the past 5
years (except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin).
The Institutional Review Board approved the study,
and all patients provided written informed consent
prior to enrollment.

Treatment and Dose Escalation
Gemcitabine was administered first as a 30-minute
intravenous infusion at a starting dose of 800 mg/
m2. Irinotecan was given as a 90-minute intravenous
infusion immediately after gemcitabine at an initial
dose of 80 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8. Carboplatin was
given initially on Day 1 only at an AUC of 4 after the
irinotecan infusion was finished. Cycles were
repeated every 3 weeks.
Further dose escalations were based on the prior
dose level toxicity. If no or 1 episode of DLT was
observed during the first cycle at a given dose level,
then the dose was escalated to the next higher dose
level. After determination of the MTD, the protocol
was amended to study an alternative schedule with
the same sequence of drug administration at different doses: Carboplatin at AUC of 2 was combined
with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 and irinotecan 60 mg/
m2, and all were given on Days 1 and 8.
At least 3 patients were to be entered at each
dose level. If 1 of the 3 patients experienced DLT at
the first cycle, then 3 additional patients were
entered at the same dose level. The MTD was
defined as 1 dose level below the dose that produced

Carboplatin, Gemcitabine, and Irinotecan/de Lima Lopes et al.

DLTs in 2 of 6 patients. DLTs were defined according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria (version 2.0) as grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicity (excluding anorexia, nausea and vomiting
not treated properly with antiemetics, and diarrhea
in patients who were not compliant with the loperamide regimen prescribed); or grade 4 neutropenia
that lasted 5 days or failure to recover neutrophils
(1.5 3 109/L) or platelets (100,000 3 106/L) by
Day 29; or grade 4 thrombocytopenia (10,000/mcl)
or any requirement for platelet transfusion. Inability
to deliver Day 8 chemotherapy on the first cycle also
was considered a DLT. Intrapatient dose escalation
was not allowed.
The treatment was resumed on cycle 2 and
beyond when the same criteria described above for
hematopoietic, hepatic, and renal recovery were
achieved. Dose modifications were allowed and were
guided by toxicity type and grade. In general, a 25%
decrease in the dose of all 3 drugs was employed,
and treatment was restarted once toxicity had
resolved or became less than grade 2. Further dose
reduction was also allowed on Day 8 of therapy.
Prophylactic antiemetics (a serotonin receptor
antagonist with metoclopramide, promethazine, or
prochlorperazine) were given prior to therapy on
Days 1 and 8. Steroids were allowed if a patient
developed nausea or vomiting despite premedication.
For patients who developed acute cholinergic symptoms, intravenous atropine at a dose from 0.5 mg to
1.0 mg was given for treatment and as secondary
prophylaxis thereafter. All patients were instructed to
begin taking loperamide at the earliest signs of diarrhea and/or abdominal cramping that occurred >24
hours after they received irinotecan. Loperamide was
prescribed as a 4-mg oral dose at the onset of diarrhea then 2 mg every 2 hours around the clock until
the patient was diarrhea-free for 12 hours. Patients
could take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours at
night. Additional measures were left to the discretion
of the treating physician.

Treatment Assessment
A complete medical history and physical examination, including a complete blood count (CBC) and a
comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP); tumor measurements; and an evaluation of performance status
were obtained before the initiation of therapy. Baseline imaging studies were obtained no more than 4
weeks before enrollment. On cycle 2 and beyond,
medical history and physical examination were repeated at least once every cycle by the treating
physician, and vital signs plus toxicity assessment
with the treating physician or a Phase I nurse practi-

1415

tioner were repeated on Day 8 of each cycle. CBC
and CMP were obtained routinely at the beginning
of every cycle, and the CBC was repeated again on
Day 8. On cycle 1 only, in addition, CBCs were
obtained on Days 11, 15, and 18, and the patients
were evaluated weekly. Assessment of adverse events
was done according to version 2.0 of the Common
Toxicity Criteria.7 Tumor evaluation was performed
after every 2 cycles, and response was assessed
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors.8 Patients received at least 2 cycles of treatment unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was encountered.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Treatment Administration
Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Baseline patient
and tumor characteristics are listed in Table 1. All
patients were evaluable for toxicity. Twenty-four
patients completed 2 cycles of chemotherapy and
also were evaluated for efficacy. Eighteen patients

were men, and 10 patients were women. The median
age was 60.5 years (range, 40–72 years). All patients
had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Eighteen patients had
received previous therapy prior to enrollment. The
median number of cycles administered per patient
was 6. In total, 146 cycles of treatment were delivered at 2 dose levels on schedule 1 and at 1 dose
level on schedule 2.

DLT and Dose Intensity
DLT is summarized on Table 2, and dose intensity is
depicted in Table 3. The first 3 patients enrolled on
schedule 1 at dose level 1 had no DLT. Of 4 patients
at the second dose level of schedule 1 (carboplatin at
an AUC of 5 on Day 1 with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2
followed by irinotecan 80 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8), 1
patient had neutropenic fever, and another patient
had thrombocytopenia that required platelet transfusion. The first dose level of schedule 1 was then
expanded to include a total of 12 patients, and, as
only 2 of those 12 patients had DLT, this was determined to be the MTD (carboplatin at an AUC of 4 on
Day 1 with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 followed by irinotecan 80 mg/m2 both on Days 1 and 8). Grade 3
diarrhea, despite treatment with loperamide, and
grade 3 diarrhea with associated grade 3 hypotension
were the DLTs observed in 2 of 12 patients at
this level. In an attempt to increase drug delivery on
Day 8 and to decrease the gastrointestinal toxicity
associated with irinotecan (mainly diarrhea), an
additional 12 patients were enrolled on schedule
2: carboplatin at an AUC of 2 with gemcitabine

800 mg/m2 and irinotecan 60 mg/m2 all given on
Days 1 and 8. Two patients were unable to receive
chemotherapy on Day 8, which constituted DLT. No
dose escalation was possible, and schedule 2 was
discontinued. Schedule 1 dose level 1 is our recommended Phase II dose for further study.

Hematologic Toxicity
Hematologic toxicity is summarized on Table 4. Six
patients developed anemia (21.4%), 22 patients had
neutropenia (78.6%), and 16 patients had thrombocytopenia (57.1%). Severe hematologic toxicities were
as follows: grade 3 anemia was observed in 4 patients
(14.3%), grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 12
patients (42.9%), and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia
was observed in 8 patients (28.6%). Two patients had
neutropenic fever (7.1%).
Nonhematologic Toxicity
On schedule 2, dose level 1, 1 patient died after the
fourth cycle of chemotherapy secondary to the development of elevated transaminases and, subsequently,
hepatic and renal failure. This serious adverse event
was scored as probably related to therapy by the investigator. The worst nonhematologic toxicities per
patient are described in Table 5. Diarrhea (14
patients; 50%) and nausea (13 patients; 46.4%) were
the most common gastrointestinal side effects. Ten
patients developed vomiting (35.7%). Abdominal
pain was reported by 8 patients (28.6%). Anorexia
was observed in 4 patients (14.3%), and asthenia was
observed in 12 patients (42.9%). Four patients had
elevated liver enzymes. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were

seen in 3 patients.

Efficacy
Twenty-four patients completed 2 cycles of chemotherapy and were assessable for efficacy. Seven objective responses were documented (Table 6), including

5 in patients with small cell or neuroendocrine carcinomas (Table 7). Of the 7 patients who responded, 4
patients had received prior chemotherapy. All 4 of
those individuals had small cell or neuroendocrine
carcinoma and had received prior treatment with
etoposide in combination with either carboplatin (1
patient) or cisplatin (3 patients). One patient with
neuroendocrine carcinoma had received no prior
therapy. The median response duration was 13 weeks

disease and 18 weeks (range, 15–23 weeks) for patients who achieved a partial or complete response.

DISCUSSION
The results from this Phase I study demonstrate that
a 3-drug regimen of carboplatin given intravenously
on Day 1 or in divided doses on Days 1 and 8, in
combination with gemcitabine and irinotecan both
given as an intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8,
every 3 weeks, is feasible. Schedule 1, dose level 1—
carboplatin at an AUC of 4 on Day 1 with gemcitabine and irinotecan at doses 800 mg/m2 and 80 mg/
m2, respectively, on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle—
is the recommended Phase II dose for further study.
However, compromise of single-agent doses is
needed to allow therapy delivery.

cycle of chemotherapy. Elevated liver enzymes have
been reported as a complication of therapy with all 3
drugs. However, fatal outcomes caused by liver insufficiency have been reported only rarely. Gemcitabine-related severe liver toxicity resulting in death
has been reported in the form of veno-occlusive liver
disease9 and cholestatic liver failure.10–12 Carboplatin
reportedly induced centrolobular hepatic necrosis in
a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia.13 In
another report from the Southwest Oncology Group,
5 patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia
who received single-agent carboplatin died of hepatic
and/or renal failure.14 Despite the narrow therapeutic
index of irinotecan in the setting of cholestasis and
liver dysfunction,15 there has been only 1 report of a
fatal outcome caused by hepatic failure in a patient
who was known as a hepatitis B virus carrier prior to
chemotherapy with irinotecan and capecitabine.16
The relation of the hepatic failure to therapy was not
established.
In the current trial, 3 other patients had
increased liver enzymes. One patient had a grade 3
elevation in liver enzymes that was associated with
biliary obstruction and was deemed not related to

Carboplatin, Gemcitabine, and Irinotecan/de Lima Lopes et al.

the study drugs. A second patient had grade 1 toxicity that the investigators believed was related to chemotherapeutic agents but that resolved without
treatment interruption. A third patient had grade 2
elevated liver enzymes that the investigators deemed
unrelated to study medications.
Objective responses were observed in 7 patients.
Four patients had received prior chemotherapy. Only
3 patients had progressive disease at the first efficacy
assessment. Six patients with small cell or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas were treated,
and 5 of those 6 patients had objective responses. Of
these, 4 patients had previously received etoposide in
combination with carboplatin (1 patient) or cisplatin
(3 patients). The median duration of response was 13
weeks for patients with stable disease and 18 weeks
for patients who achieved an objective response.
Carboplatin in combination with gemcitabine
and irinotecan is feasible. However, compromise of
single-agent doses of all 3 drugs is needed because
of toxicity. Because we did not include the use of
granulocyte-colony stimulating factors in this study,
we can only speculate that their use may have
helped maintain dose intensity. Additional studies
are warranted in patients with small cell and highgrade neuroendocrine carcinomas at a recommended
Phase II dose of carboplatin at an AUC of 4 on Day 1
with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 and irinotecan 80 mg/
m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.
