ABSTRACT:
There is clinical and experimental evidence suggesting that antiprogestins might
be used for the treatment of selected breast cancer patients. Our aim was to evaluate
the effect of albumin-bound paclitaxel (Nab-paclitaxel) and pegylated doxorubicin
liposomes (PEG-LD) in combination with mifepristone (MFP) in experimental breast
cancer models expressing different ratios of progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms A and
B. We used two antiprogestin-responsive (PRA>PRB) and two resistant (PRA<PRB)
murine mammary carcinomas growing in BALB/c, GFP-BALB/c or nude mice, along
with human T47D-YA and T47D-YB xenografts growing in immunocompromised NSG
mice. MFP improved the therapeutic effects of suboptimal doses of Nab-paclitaxel or
PEG-LD in murine and human carcinomas with higher levels of PRA than PRB. MFP
induced tissue remodeling in PRA-overexpressing tumors, increasing the stromal/
tumor cell ratio and the number of functional vessels. Accordingly, an increase in
nanoparticles and drug accumulation was observed in stromal and tumor cells in
MFP-treated tumors. We conclude that MFP induces an increase in vessels during
tissue remodeling, favoring the selective accumulation of nanoparticles inside the
tumors. We propose that antiprogestins have the potential to enhance the efficacy
of chemotherapy in breast tumors with a high PRA/PRB ratio.

INTRODUCTION

by promoting microtubule assembly from tubulin and
preventing microtubule depolymerization [4;5], inducing
apoptosis through phosphorylation and downregulation
of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-XL
respectively [6-9]. Because paclitaxel has very little
aqueous solubility, a Cremophor /ethanol vehicle is used,
but its toxicity limits the amount of paclitaxel that can
be clinically administered [10-12]. To overcome this
problem, an albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel
(Nab-paclitaxel) devoid of any solvents has been
developed, and a better response was obtained with the
latter when equitoxic doses of free or Nab-paclitaxel were

Despite efforts to develop novel therapeutic
anticancer agents to block specific signaling pathways,
chemotherapy is still the gold standard for advanced
breast cancer treatment. The challenge is to increase
chemotherapeutic concentrations within the tumor
environment while decreasing the general toxicity.
Two drugs have been widely used: paclitaxel [1] and
doxorubicin [2].

Doxorubicin is a 14-hydroxylated version of
daunorubicin, which is a natural product produced by
wild type strains of Streptomyces [15]. The clinical
usefulness of doxorubicin is limited due to dose-related
progressive myocardial damage [16]. To overcome
this drawback, different methods of drug delivery were
developed, including pegylated liposomes. Due to the
leaky vasculature of tumor vessels, pegylated liposomes
preferentially distribute to tumors over normal tissue, thus
decreasing the incidence rate of cardiotoxicity [17].
Two-thirds of breast cancers express hormone
receptors and are subjected to endocrine therapy
generally aimed at blocking estrogen receptors (ER)
[18]. There is, however, compelling evidence suggesting
that progesterone receptors (PRs) may also be used
as therapeutic targets [reviewed in [19-20]. Most PR+
tumors express levels of PR isoform A (PRA) higher
than those of isoform B (PRB) [21-25] and the
presence of PRA may reduce the efficiency of taxanes
on mammary tumor growth [26]. We have shown that
murine mammary carcinomas with a high PRA/PRB
ratio respond to antiprogestin treatment [27-29] and that
this is characterized by an increase in stroma [30] and in
metalloprotease activity [31].
We hypothesized that in PRA positive tumors, cotreatment of antiprogestins may allow for the use of lower
doses of chemotherapeutic agents thereby reducing their
side effects. In this study, we show that mifepristone
(MFP) treatment improves the therapeutic effect of
pegylated doxorubicin liposomes (PEG-LD) and Nabpaclitaxel by increasing tumor vascularization and thus the

intratumoral concentration of nanotherapeutic particles.

RESULTS
Pegylated doxorubicin liposomes improve
the therapeutic response compared to free
doxorubicin
We first compared the therapeutic effect of PEGLD and free doxorubicin using MFP-responsive tumors
of the medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-induced breast
cancer model (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 2 (top),
PEG-LD at 18 and 9 mg/kg induced almost complete
tumor regression and was more efficacious as compared
with free doxorubicin as observed with the lower dose
(p<0.05). Few tumor cells immersed in a dense stromal
tissue were observed in PEG-LD treated tumors at the
end of the experiment (Figure 2, bottom). However, with
the highest dose (18 mg/kg), there were signs of toxicity,
such as loss of body weight (Figure 3A) and palmoplantar
erythrodysesthesia (not shown). Histologically, these
PEG-LD-treated mice had specific skin lesions, with
marked acanthopapillomatosis, hyperkeratosis and dermal
fibrosis. We also observed mild cardiac hypertrophy. The
other histological signs encountered were those typical
of a cachectic state. The 9 mg/kg doses showed in a less
degree some of the previously mentioned lesions. No other
signs were found in mice receiving lower doses during the
course of the experiments. These experiments indicated
that even lower doses of PEG-LD should be selected for

induced by MPA are maintained by syngeneic passages in MPA-treated or untreated BALB/c mice. Occasionally hormone independent
(HI) variants arise. These HI variants show different PR isoform ratios. C4-2-HI and 59-HI express higher levels of PRB than PRA and are
resistant to MFP treatment (Western blots in the right panel). C4-HI and 59-2-HI show higher levels of PRA than PRB (Western blots in
the left panel) and are MFP responsive tumors. These four tumors were selected for this study. The model is reviewed in Lanari et al., [32].

stromal tissue, as previously reported [28], while PEGLD increased necrosis. Few tumor cells surrounded
by collagen fibers were observed with the combined
treatments. In 59-2-HI, MFP induces an increase in the
stroma/parenchyma ratio, decreases mitosis and increases
apoptosis [30]. This tumor is so sensitive to MFP that we
had to reduce the doses as much as 30 times as compared
with that used for C4-HI tumors. PEG-LD at very low
doses also relatively increased the stromal tissue, and
epithelial cells with large bizarre nuclei were observed.
Similar images with increased necrotic areas were seen in
tumors with combined treatments (not shown).

We then evaluated the combination of low doses of
PEG-LD (Doxopeg; 0.9 or 0.45 mg/kg) together with MFP
in two MFP-responsive tumors expressing higher levels of
PRA than PRB and in two MFP-resistant tumors with the
opposite PR ratio (Figure 1). The doses of PEG-LD and
MFP were fixed for each tumor to avoid complete tumor
regressions. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, the combined
treatments showed improved effects compared with the
single treatments only in MFP-responsive tumors (C4-HI
and 59-2-HI). Histological images of C4-HI tumors at the
end of the experiment are shown in Figure 4A (upper right

early tumor differentiation, as expected [28], and MFP
+ Nab-paclitaxel-treated tumors showed a differentiation
pattern similar to that of MFP-treated tumors. The Nabpaclitaxel signature was usually present shortly after
treatment began, and giant cells with dense chromatin
were frequently seen (Figure 6A, right). At the end of
treatment, in most cases, more than 90 % of the tumor
cells were lost (not shown). No additive effect was found
in C4-2-HI tumors co-treated with Nab-paclitaxel (15 mg/
kg) and MFP (Figure 6B).

We first tested the effect of three doses of 60 and
30 mg/kg of Nab-paclitaxel on body weight and tumor
growth using tumors transplanted in nude mice (to avoid
the potential immunogenic effect of the human albumin
present in Nab-paclitaxel). Both doses induced a similar
inhibitory effect on C4-2-HI tumor growth (Figure 5).
Tumors disappeared almost completely after treatment,
although they started growing back 10 days after the last
dose. Only the dose of 60 mg/kg did induce a significant
decrease in body weight (Figure 3C). The animals went
back to their original weight within one week after the
last dose of Nab-paclitaxel, and no specific histological
alterations were found in autopsies of this group.
We then studied the effect of Nab-paclitaxel (30
mg/kg) on the growth of antiprogestin-responsive C4HI tumors. This dose did not significantly inhibit tumor
growth. However, co-treatment with MFP improved
the inhibitory effect induced by MFP (Figure 6A left).
Selected animals were euthanized 10 days after treatment
initiation). Nab-paclitaxel treatment induced aberrant
mitotic figures and multiple hyperchromic nuclei
(Figure 6A right). However, tumor histoarchitecture
was essentially similar to that of the control tumors,
and the tumors continued growing. MFP induced very

xenografts, as expected (Wargon and Riggio et al,
submitted). Nab-paclitaxel had an increased inhibitory
effect on T47D-YB xenografts, while PEG-LD had it on
T47D-YA tumors. We observed an improved therapeutic
effect with combined treatments only in T47D-YA tumors
(Figure 7A). Moreover, MFP lowered the inhibitory effect
of Nab-paclitaxel in the T47D-YB tumors. Large amounts
of collagen fibers were observed in all regressing tumors
(Masson’s trichrome staining; Figure 7B). Cytokeratin
(CK) staining (Figure 4C) revealed the relative amount
of epithelial tumor cells in relation to the tumor mass,
indicating that the therapeutic effect was even greater than

To evaluate whether this increased vascularization
could be responsible for an increase in drug accumulation,

higher in the tumors subjected to the combined treatments.
No differences were observed in similarly treated C4-2-HI
tumors (Figure 11B).
Similarly, the amount of Nab-paclitaxel present in
the tumors was indirectly evaluated using a polyclonal
anti-human albumin antibody. Increased staining was
found in animals subjected to combined treatments (Figure
11C). No staining was observed in the negative controls.

In this study we show that mammary carcinomas
expressing different ratios of PR isoforms are sensitive to
both PEG-LD (anthracycline) and Nab-paclitaxel (taxane).
Antiprogestin-resistant tumors were very sensitive to Nabpaclitaxel, whereas tumors with higher levels of PRA than
PRB were less sensitive (C4-HI vs. C4-2-HI and T47DYA vs. T47D-YB). The opposite result was observed

with PEG-LD treatment. Targeting PRA-overexpressing
tumors with antiprogestins resensitized the tumors to both
chemotherapeutic treatments.
Because chemotherapy is the therapy of choice
for metastatic breast disease, an ideal scenario would
be to improve its efficacy by specifically increasing
the delivery into tumor cells, thus reducing potentially
deleterious side effects associated with normal tissue
targeting. Nab-paclitaxel accumulates in cancer cells due
to their increased ability to engulf albumin [32]. Pegylated
liposomes are also concentrated in tumor cells because of
the leaky tumor vasculature [16]. Antiprogestin treatment
may increase the efficiency of these highly selective
agents in a subgroup of breast cancer patients: those
overexpressing PRA.
To explain the potential mechanisms involved in
this increased efficacy, we examined several possibilities.
It has been reported that MFP and progesterone are able
to bind multidrug-resistant proteins and thus improve the
entry of chemotherapeutic agents into the cells [33;34].
Although this may be a very interesting possibility to
explore, it does not seem to be the prevailing mechanism
because almost complete tumor regressions were observed
with anthracyclines in this model (Figure 2A), which is a
response that is not compatible with a multidrug resistance
mechanism. Therefore, we explored the possibility
that the tissue remodeling induced by antiprogestin
treatment could be responsible for the drug accumulation.
Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that the therapeutic
effects of doxorubicin were decreased in KO mice lacking
MMP-9 [35], and interestingly, MMP-9 expression is
increased in tumors of the MPA breast cancer model
treated with MFP [31].
Using endothelial markers, we showed an increase
in the number of capillary-type vessels within the tumor.
This result, although counterintuitive at first, also negates
the idea that diminished angiogenesis might play a role
in MFP-induced tumor regression. Conversely, these
new functional vessels participate in the distribution
of the chemotherapeutic drugs within the tumor. A
proangiogenic effect may be the direct outcome of
an initial hypoxic state induced by the first dose of the
chemotherapeutic agent. However, since MFP alone
induces apoptosis, necrosis and/or cytostasis in the tumor
parenchyma of PRA-overexpressing tumors, it seems
likely that this increased angiogenesis is driven by nonspecific stromal changes, secondary to epithelial cell
death. The mechanisms that trigger these effects deserve
further investigation. Our results are in agreement with
those reported by Nakasone et al., who found that free
doxorubicin accumulates in cells flanking tumor vessels
in two different transgenic mouse models [35]. In support
of the remodeling hypothesis, we also demonstrated that
estrogen treatment, which also induces tumor regression
in this model [36], is also able to increase the therapeutic
effect of these chemotherapeutic drugs (data not shown).

Other drugs have also been proposed to alter the tumor
microenvironment such as hialuronidase that improved
the access of PEG-LD in osteosarcoma xenografts [37], or
losartan, an angiotensin receptor inhibitor that inhibits the
synthesis of collagen type I present in desmoplastic tumors
[38]. Losartan improved the therapeutic effect of 4 mg/kg
PEG-LD, which is a suboptimal chemotherapeutic dose
that is 4 times higher than the doses used in our assays.
The doses of PEG-LD used is our study ranged from 18
mg/kg (equivalent to a human dose of 54 mg/m2) to 0.45
mg/kg (equivalent to 1.85 mg/m2)[39]. For breast cancer
treatment a dose of 50 mg/m2 is recommended.
Our studies also suggest that anthracyclines may be
a better option than taxanes for the treatment of tumors
overexpressing PRA, while taxanes may be better for those
expressing PRB. The reason for this selectivity is still not
known. For paclitaxel, it can be speculated that PRAoverexpressing tumors have increased levels of BCL-XL
or BCL-2 than their PRB counterparts [40]; alternatively,
they may have increased levels of other proteins related
to microtubule assembly that are oppositely regulated
by taxanes [26]. An excess of these proteins may be
decreasing paclitaxel efficacy.
Some of the histopathological observations
regarding the paclitaxel effect may deserve further
investigation. We are currently exploring the biological
consequences that the presence of aberrant mitosis may
have in tumors that are not growth inhibited by paclitaxel
at doses of 30 mg/kg such as C4-HI. These observations
may have clinical relevance, as they indicate that paclitaxel
treatment should be potent enough to destroy the majority
of proliferating cells, thus avoiding the selection of more
aggressive phenotypes. In the same line, it has been
recently reported that paclitaxel may increase polyploidy
and therefore alter the status of erbB2 expression [41].
There are several reports regarding the effect of
combined chemotherapeutic treatments and endocrine
therapies. In preclinical studies involving fulvestrant
or tamoxifen, it has been shown that fulvestrant exerts
synergic effects with other chemotherapeutic agents
under experimental conditions in which tamoxifen failed
[42]. In clinical studies in which combined or sequential
adjuvant tamoxifen and chemotherapy were compared,
no beneficial effects were observed with combined
treatments [43]. Hypotheses predicting an additive or
synergistic effect, such as reversal of p170-mediated
resistance to anthracyclines by tamoxifen, appeared
not to play a clinically relevant role. The most accepted
explanation for this failure was that tamoxifen decreased
the number of proliferating cells, thus creating cytokinetic
resistance to chemotherapy. It can be hypothesized that
in the absence of a significant tumor mass, as occurs in
adjuvant therapies, the remodeling effect of endocrine
therapy described in this study does not take place.
Accordingly, the mechanisms we describe here may
synergize with those of chemotherapeutic agents delivered

while lowering potential side effects. We expect that in the
near future, antiprogestins might be an option for breast
cancer patients overexpressing PRA.
Interestingly, Skor et al [44] reported that MFP
increased the efficiency of paclitaxel in triple negative
xenografts, thus counteracting the protective effect that
glucocorticoid receptors (GR) exert on chemotherapy.
Because these results indicate a beneficial effect of MFP
in combination with paclitaxel, it may be argued that
GR might also be playing a similar role in our studies.
However, the fact that T47D-YA and T47D-YB xenografts
only differ in the introduced PR isoform and that only
the T47D-YA xenografts showed improvement with
combined therapies suggests that this is not the prevailing
mechanism.
In summary, we propose that breast cancer patients
with advanced disease should be categorized according to
the prevailing PR isoform expressed. For those expressing
high levels of PRA, the combination of an antiprogestin
together with a chemotherapeutic agent may allow for
the use of lower chemotherapeutic doses, mainly in neoadjuvant protocols, thus improving the quality of life.

mice. One week prior to cell inoculation, E2 silastic pellets
containing 0.5 mg 17-βestraciol (E2) were subcutaneously
(sc) implanted [48].

Treatments
Free doxorubicin and the PEG-LD Doxopeg
were a kind gift of Laboratorios Raffo (Buenos Aires)
whereas Nab-paclitaxel Abraxane (Abraxis Bioscience)
is a commercial preparation. PEG-LD vehicle and
free human albumin, provided by Laboratorios Raffo,
were used as a control in PEG-LD or Nab-paclitaxel
experiments respectively. PEG-LD or doxorubicin were
administered intravenously (iv) in a range of 18-0.45 mg/
kg body weight once a week. For the highest dose we
used a protocol adapted from Charrois and Allen [49].
Three consecutive doses of 60, 30 or 15 mg/kg of Nabpaclitaxel were given iv every 4 days [50]. MFP (Sigma,
St Louis, MI) was administered using 6 or 0.2 mg pellets
implanted subcutaneously (sc) or by sc daily injections of
10 mg/kg body weight. Tumor size was evaluated using a
Vernier caliper. Mice were euthanized, and transplanted
tumors and metastases were fixed in buffered formalin
and embedded in paraffin. Five microns sections were
used for histological diagnoses (H-E staining and Masson
trichrome). The pathological response to treatments was
assessed according to Miller and Payne grading system
[51]. To evaluate the intra tumor drug content, mice were
treated for 5 days with MFP, and then with Nab-albumin
or PEG-LD for 24 hours.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Two-month-old virgin female BALB/c mice
(Animal Facility, IBYME) were used. Transgenic mice
expressing enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)
under the direction of the human ubiquitin C promoter
(The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were bred
at IBYME (BALB/c-GFP). Nu/nu females were obtained
from the University of La Plata and NOD/LtSz-scid/IL2Rgamma null mice (NSG) from The Jackson Laboratory
and bred at IBYME. Animal care and manipulation were
in agreement with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals [45].

Side effects
Mice without tumors (6-8 per group) were treated as
described above, and weighed once a week (PEG-LD) or
every four days (Nab-paclitaxel). PEG-LD-treated mice
were sacrificed after one month and Nab-paclitaxel-treated
mice after 10 days of treatment. For leukocyte counting,
PEG-LD was administered once a week and mice were
bled 3 times a week during 20 days (n=8). Leukocytes
were counted using the analyzer Ac T diff of Coulter.

Tumors and xenografts

Immunofluorescence

C4-HI, C4-2-HI, 59-HI or 59-2-HI carcinomas from
the MPA-induced murine breast cancer model [46], all
expressing ER and PR, were orthotopically transplanted
into the mammary gland 4 of BALB/c, BALB/c-GFP or
nu/nu mice. C4-HI and 59-2-HI tumors regress with MFP
treatment and express levels of PRA higher than those of
PRB; C4-2-HI and 59-HI are constitutive MFP-resistant
tumor variants with levels of PRB higher than those of
PRA (Figure 1) [28]. T47D-YA and T47D-YB cells were
a kind gift of Dr. K. Horwitz (University of Colorado)
and were cultured as previously described [47]. Cells
(5x106) were inoculated orthotopically into NSG female

Frozen tumor sections (15 µm) were fixed in
10% formalin, transferred to 70% ethanol, blocked, and
successively incubated overnight with CD31 (550274,
BD Pharmingen) or with anti human albumin (ab2406;
Abcam), antibodies and processed as described previously
(32). The nuclei were counterstained with propidium
iodide (PI) and analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse E800
confocal Microscope. Images were taken with a Nikon
DS-U1 camera with ACT-2U software. BALB/c-GFP mice
were perfused with a cold saline solution (0.9% NaCl)
