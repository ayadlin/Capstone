BACKGROUND: The authors performed a phase 2 study of bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by maintenance
bevacizumab in patients with advanced, nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer. METHODS: Previously untreated patients with
advanced, nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1
received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin at an area under the concentration-time curve of 6 intravenously on day 1 every 21 days. Responding or stable patients who completed 6 cycles then received bevacizumab maintenance every
21 days until disease progression. RESULTS: In total, 43 patients (40 who were evaluable for response) were entered on the study.
Treatment-related grade 3/4 toxicities were low and included febrile neutropenia (2%), neutropenia (28%), anemia (18%), thrombocytopenia (11%), hypertension (7%), epistaxis (5%), venous thrombosis (8%), dyspnea (7%), rectovaginal fistula (2.3%), infusion reaction
(2%), and cerebrovascular event (2%). One patient died from complications of venous thromboembolism and cerebrovascular accident after Cycle 2. Minimal clinically significant toxicity occurred during maintenance bevacizumab. Two complete responses (5%)
were observed, and 17 patients (42%) had a partial response. Fifteen patients (38%) displayed disease stability. The overall disease
control rate was 85%. At a median follow-up of 15.8 months, the median progression-free survival was 7.1 months (95% confidence
interval, 5.9-8.3 months), and the median overall survival was 17.1 months (95% confidence interval, 8.8-25.5 months). CONCLUSIONS:
Combined bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin followed by maintenance bevacizumab was well tolerated and displayed remarkable activity in patients with previously untreated, advanced, nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer. Cancer 2012;118:5580-7.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer remains a therapeutic challenge. It is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and approximately 85% of
patients who are diagnosed with this neoplasm will die from their disease. There are more than 1.6 million new cases of
lung cancer worldwide annually, and approximately 75% to 80% are nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).1-3 The majority
of patients present with advanced disease, and 40% to 70% of those with stage I through III NSCLC develop distant metastatic disease after initial therapy.
Treatment options for patients advanced NSCLC previously were limited, because most clinical trials of cytotoxic
agents produced <1 year of survival, many at the cost of significant toxicities.4-6 In the past, front-line, systemic therapy
typically was discontinued after 4 to 6 cycles in responding patients, because there were no convincing data indicating that
patients could benefit from continuation of the same therapy, in part because of cumulative toxicity. Therefore, long periods of disease control were not achievable in most patients, because the disease typically would progress within 3 to 4
months of stopping front-line therapy, and second-line agents would then be options only for patients with reasonable
performance status.
To our knowledge, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) study 4599 was the first to suggest that the continuation of 1 component of initial combination therapy in patients who had a benefit could improve survival.7 In that
phase 3 study, >800 previously chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous NSCLC were randomized to receive either bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin for 6 cycles followed by maintenance bevacizumab or
paclitaxel and carboplatin alone for up to 6 cycles. A median survival of 12.3 months was achieved in the group assigned
to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared with 10.3 months in the chemotherapy-alone group; and the median

progression-free survival (PFS) for the 2 groups was 6.2
months and 4.5 months, respectively, with corresponding
response rates of 35% and 15% (P < .001). The results
from that trial established a new standard of care in this
patient population. The mode of action of bevacizumab, a
monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its lack of cumulative toxicity made it
particularly compelling for use as maintenance therapy in
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.
Shortly after the publication of ECOG 4599, a
randomized trial of the novel antifolate pemetrexed
proved that it was not inferior to docetaxel as second-line
treatment for NSCLC.8 A subsequent study revealed that
combination pemetrexed and cisplatin was superior to
gemcitabine and cisplatin in the front-line setting for
patients with nonsquamous histology,9 and pemetrexed is
now used routinely in combination with a platinum agent
for previously untreated patients with nonsquamous
NSCLC.
The finding of superior activity of pemetrexed in
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and its overall favorable toxicity profile suggest that it potentially may build
on the results of ECOG 4599 when combined with bevacizumab and carboplatin in a similar fashion. Here, we
present the results from our phase 2 study of this combination followed by maintenance bevacizumab in patients
with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility

Eligible patients were aged 18 years and had cytologically or histologically confirmed, nonsquamous NSCLC
that was stage IIIB (malignant pleural effusion) or IV and
had received no prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
biologic therapy, or antiangiogenic drugs. Patients also
were required to have measurable disease; an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function as defined by the following
required laboratory values: serum creatinine <1.5 mg/dL,
absolute neutrophil count 1500/mm3, platelet count
100,000/mm3, total bilirubin <2 times the upper limit
of normal, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels <2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (for
patients with hepatic involvement of their cancer, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels <5 times the
upper limit of normal were required). Patients with a history of hypertension were required to be well controlled
(blood pressure <150/100) on a stable regimen of antihypertensive therapy. Patients also were required to have
completed any radiation therapy >3 weeks before regisCancer

tration. Patients with squamous cell histology, or with a
lung carcinoma of any histology in close proximity to a
major vessel, or with cavitation or evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy were excluded as were patients
who were receiving anticoagulation or who had a history
of gross hemoptysis (defined as bright red blood of a half
teaspoon or more). This study was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution.
At the initiation of the protocol, patients were
required to undergo central nervous system imaging as
part of study screening and were not eligible if brain metastases were present. Patients with treated brain metastases also were not eligible. After safety data were provided
by the sponsor, the protocol was amended in January
2008 to allow patients with treated brain metastases onto
the study if there was no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging studies (magnetic resonance
imaging or computed tomography) during the screening
period, and if they had no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone. Patients were not eligible if they had central
nervous system metastases treated by resection or brain biopsy; significant vascular disease within 6 months; a history of abdominal fistula, perforation, or intra-abdominal
abscess within 6 months; uncontrolled illness, including
prior hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy,
ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart
failure (New York Heart Association grade II or greater
heart failure), and active cerebrovascular or cardiovascular
disease within the prior 6 months; a major surgical procedure within 28 days before entry; or minor surgery or needle biopsies within 7 days before entry. Women of
childbearing potential and men partnered with women of
childbearing potential were required to use an effective
method of contraception beginning before study entry,
for the duration of study participation, and for a minimum of 3 months after the last dose of chemotherapy.
Women of childbearing potential were required to have a
baseline negative pregnancy test within 7 days of receiving
the first dose of study medication. Patients who were
receiving chronic daily treatment with aspirin (>325 mg
daily) or other agents known to inhibit platelet function
were not eligible.
Study Design and Treatment

This was a 2-site, single-arm, phase 2, open-label study.
Treatment was administered on an outpatient basis. Vitamin B12 (1000 mg) was administered every 9 weeks starting 1 week before the first cycle until 2 months after the
last dose of pemetrexed. Patients received folic acid 1 mg
5581

Original Article

orally every day 1 week before the first cycle and continued until 2 months after the last dose of pemetrexed. Bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin were
administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. Patients received
commercially available pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 as a 10minute intravenous infusion on day 1, carboplatin (commercially available) at an area under the concentrationtime curve of 6 as a 30-minute intravenous infusion on
day 1 immediately after pemetrexed, and bevacizumab
(supplied by Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif)
15 mg/kg as a 30-minute to 90-minute intravenous infusion on day 1 immediately after carboplatin. Patients who
responded or who had stable disease received a maximum
of 6 cycles of bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin.
After the initial 6 cycles, patients were maintained on bevacizumab 15 mg/kg alone every 3 weeks as a 30-minute
infusion until they had evidence of disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity.
Assessments

Patients were evaluated for response every other cycle for the
first 6 cycles and after every third cycle during the maintenance phase. Response was determined according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
guidelines. All toxicities were graded using National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0 (available
at: ctep.cancer.gov; [accessed April 5, 2012]).
Statistical Methods

The primary objective of the study at the time of original
design was to determine the time to disease progression
(TTP) with the combination of bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin. Secondary objectives included
the assessment of toxicities and the measurement of
response rate, PFS, and overall survival (OS). TTP was
chosen originally as the primary endpoint for determining
the sample size based on results from the randomized
phase 2 trial of bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin
reported by Johnson et al.10 The results from ECOG
4599 had not been published at the time this study was
conceived (OS and PFS were reported). We present the
results for PFS in the current report, because this endpoint
is more relevant since the publication of ECOG 4599 and
the subsequent approval of bevacizumab in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.
Given the TTP of 8 months observed with the combination of 15 mg/kg bevacizumab plus paclitaxel/carboplatin
in the randomized phase 2 trial10 and the expected TTP of
4 months from randomized studies of platinum-based combinations in NSCLC,5 a similar TTP of 8 months with the
combination would be considered evidence of activity and
5582

would be worthy of further study. With a planned sample
size of 40 patients, under the assumption of exponential survival, the median of 8 months suggested a 35.4% TTP at 12
months, whereas the median of 4 months suggested a
17.33% TTP at 12 months. Forty-two patients were to be
accrued in a 1-stage design with the assumption that, at
most, 2 patients would drop out, so that the final sample
size would be 40 patients. If the true 12-month TTP rate
proved to be 17.33%, then this design would have at
most a 3.4% probability of declaring the agent worthy of
further study. If the true 12-month TTP was 35.4%, then
this design would have at least an 80% probability of declaring the agent worthy.
PFS was measured from the time of registration to
the time of documented disease progression. Disease progression was assumed in patients who died before documentation of progression or in patients who started
therapy and were lost to follow-up. OS was calculated
from the date of registration to the date of death. Survival
data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Between September 2005 and December of 2009, 43 eligible patients were enrolled at 2 institutions: Cooper Cancer Institute, Voorhees, NJ and the University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. Of these, 40 patients were
evaluable for response. Three patients discontinued treatment after 1 cycle because of toxicity. All 43 patients were
included in the current toxicity and survival analyses. No
patients remained on study at the time of this report.
Patient demographics are provided in Table 1. The
median age was 65.3 years (range, 34.6-80.4 years).
Twenty-three patients (54%) were women, and 20
patients were men (46%). Thirty-three patients had adenocarcinoma histology, 9 patients had NSCLC not otherwise specified, and 1 patient had large cell carcinoma.
Eighty-eight percent of patients had stage IV disease, and
84% had an ECOG performance status of zero.
Treatment

The median number of cycles delivered was 9 (range, 165 cycles). Twenty-eight patients (65%) received the full
6 or more cycles of chemotherapy and bevacizumab, and
25 patients (58%) went on to receive maintenance bevacizumab. Of those who started bevacizumab maintenance,
the median number of cycles was 6 (range, 1-59 cycles).
Reasons for stopping treatment included disease progression (34 patients), toxicity (7 patients), patient choice (1
patient), and death (1 patient died of respiratory failure

Safety

Overall grade 3 and 4 hematologic and nonhematologic
toxicities were low and reflected known potential side
effects of these agents. Grade 1/2 and Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events are listed in Tables 2 and 3,
respectively.

discontinuation after Cycle 22, and 1 patient transferred
care to another institution after Cycle 9.

Most hematologic toxicities were without clinical sequelae. Grade 1/2 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia as a
worst grade during Cycles 1 through 6 was observed in 12
patients (28%) and 22 patients (51%), respectively. One
patient developed febrile neutropenia, 6 patients (14%)
had grade 4 neutropenia, 2 patients (4%) had grade 4 anemia, and 2 patients (4%) had grade 4 thrombocytopenia.
Supportive therapies like pegfilgrastim were not used as
primary prophylaxis.
Nonhematologic Toxicity

Grade 1/2 nonhematologic toxicities as a worst grade during
Cycles 1 through 6 included: nausea (20 patients; 46%),
vomiting (11 patients; 26%), fatigue (33 patients; 77%),
stomatitis/mucositis (11 patients; 26%), diarrhea (14
patients; 32%), headache (5 patients; 12%), hypertension

aminotransferase levels (20 patients; 46%). More severe toxicities observed during Cycles 1 through 6 were grade 3/4 fatigue (2 patients; 4%), grade 3 infusion reaction (1 patient;
2%), grade 3 rectovaginal fistula in a patient who had a history of diverticulosis (2%), grade 3 dyspnea (3 patients;
7%), grade 3 hypertension (3 patients; 7%), grade 3 epistaxis (2 patients; 4%), grade 3/4 venous thromboembolism
(4 patients; 9%), and cerebrovascular event (1 patient; 2%).
There were no episodes of pulmonary hemorrhage. With
the exception of hypertension, epistaxis, and fatigue, it is
not clear whether these adverse events were attributable to
study therapy. Toxicities during maintenance bevacizumab
were uncommon: One patient each had grade 3 nausea,
grade 3 headache, and grade 4 proteinuria (removed from
study), and 1 patient had grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase
elevation with progressive liver metastases.
Efficacy

Forty patients were assessable for response (Table 4). Two
patients (5%) had a complete response, and 17 patients
(42%) had a partial response for an overall response rate
of 47%. Fifteen patients (38%) had stable disease. The
disease control rate was 85%.
At a median follow-up of 15.8 months (range, 1.163 months), the median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI,
5.9-8.3 months), and the median OS was 17.1 months
(95% CI, 8.8-25.5 months). The 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 56% and 21%, respectively. Six patients
(14%) were alive >3 years after study entry, and 9 patients
remained alive at the date of last follow-up (March 24,
2011). Figures 1 and 2 provide Kaplan-Meier estimates
PFS and OS, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The positive results from this study build on the paradigm
shift in the front-line treatment of nonsquamous NSCLC
produced by the results from ECOG 4599. Not only did
ECOG 4599 demonstrate that an antiangiogenic agent
(bevacizumab) added to the efficacy of platinum-based
doublet therapy in terms of improved response rate, TTP,
and OS, it also established a potential role for maintenance therapy after initial combination therapy. In our
study, the substitution of pemetrexed for paclitaxel
resulted in better patient tolerance with less hematologic
toxicity than what was observed in ECOG 4599 (26% vs
14% grade 4 neutropenia); and it also resulted in less ‘‘inchair’’ time for patients, because pemetrexed is administered as a 10-minute infusion, whereas paclitaxel is
administered as a 3-hour infusion after additional premedication to prevent allergic reaction. Pemetrexed also is

associated with less alopecia, musculoskeletal toxicity, and
neurologic toxicity than paclitaxel. It is noteworthy that
no unexpected toxicities emerged with the addition of
pemetrexed to carboplatin and bevacizumab. The efficacy
results from this study also compare very favorably to the
ECOG 4599 results with an overall response rate of 46%
compared with 35% and an overall median survival of
17.1 months versus 12.3 months, recognizing that ours
was a phase 2 trial with a higher proportion of patients
who had an ECOG performance status of zero (84% vs
40%). Fifty-eight percent of patients were able to receive
bevacizumab maintenance on our trial, similar to the rate
of 53% in ECOG 4599. Bevacizumab maintenance was
discontinued for disease progression in 88% of patients
who received it in our study, highlighting our finding that
bevacizumab monotherapy was very well tolerated overall.
The only other reported randomized data for frontline bevacizumab-containing combinations versus chemotherapy alone in nonsquamous patients come from the 3armed Avastin in Lung Cancer (AVAiL) trial of cisplatin,
gemcitabine, plus either bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg or 15
mg/kg) or placebo.11 The authors reported improved PFS
in the bevacizuamb-containing arms; however, no differences in OS were noted. Remarkable OS was observed in
all 3 arms at >13 months. The investigators believed this
was because additional lines of therapy, including pemetrexed, were received by patients in all 3 treatment arms
(>60% of patients per arm).
Since the initiation of our study and the reports of
ECOG 4599 and AVAiL, we have learned much about
the role of pemetrexed in the treatment of NSCLC. We
now know that pemetrexed has superior activity in nonsquamous versus squamous NSCLC when received alone
or in combination with a platinum agent, and now it is
used exclusively in nonsquamous subtypes. Most recently,
Ciuleanu et al reported improved PFS (4.5 months vs 2.6
months) and OS (15.5 months vs 10.3 months) in
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC when they received
Cancer

pemetrexed as maintenance therapy until progression
developed after 4 cycles of a platinum-containing doublet
versus placebo plus best supportive care.12 That study led
to the approval of ‘‘switch’’ maintenance therapy with
pemetrexed. Given the relatively short infusion times and
similar schedule of administration, the prospect of the
combination of 2 maintenance therapies (bevacizumab
and pemetrexed) in nonsquamous NSCLC has become
attractive. Patel et al conducted a phase 2 study of bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin followed by maintenance bevacizumab and pemetrexed in a total of 51
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.13 Those authors
reported a response rate of 55%, a median PFS of 7.8
months, and a median OS of 14.1 months, not dissimilar
to our results. The adverse event profile for the regimen
also was fairly similar to that in our study, although grade
3/4 diverticulitis was observed in 8% of their patients, and
Cancer

November 15, 2012

their study subsequently was amended to exclude patients
who had a history of diverticulitis or significant diverticulosis. The development of a rectovaginal fistula in 1
patient on our study who had underlying diverticular disease raises the possibility that this toxicity may be unique
to this regimen, although bowel perforation is a known
adverse event associated with bevacizumab (with an overall incidence of 2.4% per prescribing information).14 Spigel et al recently reported their results with maintenance
bevacizumab alone after 6 cycles of pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in a randomized phase 2 trial comparing that regimen to pemetrexed, gemcitabine, and
bevacizumab in elderly patients (aged >70 years) with
advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC.15 Improved TTP and
OS were observed in the pemetrexed, carboplatin, and
bevacizumab arm at 10.2 months and 14.8 months,
respectively, and the response rate was 35%. These

findings are comparable to our results as well as those of
Patel and colleagues with doublet maintenance therapy.
The results of our study demonstrated that combination bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin followed by ‘‘continuous’’ maintenance therapy with
bevacizumab alone for bevacizumab-eligible patients with
nonsquamous NSCLC builds on the current US standard
of care with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in
terms of efficacy, tolerability, and ease of administration.
The question of maintenance monotherapy versus doublet therapy is important with respect not only to efficacy
and toxicity but also to cost, because patients who exhibit
a continuing benefit may remain on maintenance therapy
for durations ranging from months to years.
Three ongoing randomized trials will help to answer
this question. The POINTBREAK trial of bevacizumab,
pemetrexed, and carboplatin followed by maintenance bev5586

acizumab plus pemetrexed versus bevacizumab, paclitaxel,
and carboplatin followed by bevacizumab monotherapy has
completed planned accrual of approximately 900 patients,
and results are expected sometime soon.16 It is noteworthy
that the maintenance approach in POINTBREAK after
bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin did not feature
bevacizumab monotherapy but, rather, the bevacizumab
and pemetrexed combination as piloted by Patel et al.
The AVAPERL1 study (a study of bevacizumab
[Avastin] with or without pemetrexed as maintenance therapy after Avastin in first line in patients with nonsquamous
NSCLC) comparing maintenance bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg
every 21 days) versus maintenance bevacizumab (7.5 mg/
kg) plus pemetrexed after 4 cycles of front-line bevacizumab
(7.5 mg/kg), pemetrexed, and cisplatin has completed
accrual.17 Final results are pending; however, preliminary
results presented at the 2011 European Multidisciplinary
Cancer

November 15, 2012

Maintenance Bevacizumab Alone in NSCLC/Stevenson et al

Cancer Congress indicated a 50% reduction in the hazard
ratio for PFS with doublet maintenance therapy versus
monotherapy.18 The results of that study also may raise the
question of using cisplatin versus carboplatin in the frontline setting, because the phase 3 results favoring pemetrexed
in patients with nonsquamous disease were observed with
cisplatin.9 We chose to use carboplatin in our trial to be consistent with ECOG 4599, because the AVAiL results had
not been reported yet, and carboplatin is generally the preferred platinum agent for use in advanced NSCLC in the
United States. However, it is noteworthy that results from
the cisplatin versus carboplatin (CISCA) meta-analysis
reported in 2007 (after the initiation of our trial) indicated
that cisplatin-based therapies produced superior response
rates and survival compared with carboplatin-based regimens, and the survival effect was most notable in patients
with nonsquamous histology who were receiving ‘‘thirdgeneration’’ chemotherapy regimens, although no pemetrexed-containing or bevacizumab-containing studies were
included.19 Therefore, the AVAPERL1 overall survival
results will be of great interest in this regard.
The third trial, ECOG 5508, which is currently in
progress, investigates bevacizumab versus pemetrexed
given alone versus combination bevacizumab and pemetrexed as maintenance therapy after 4 cycles of bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in patients with
advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC.20 The results of these 3
important trials should clarify the preferred maintenance
strategy in bevacizumab-eligible patients.
