BACKGROUND. The safety and efficacy of the fully human antibody panitumumab
was evaluated in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to available
therapies.

METHODS. This phase 2 open-label, multicenter study of panitumumab enrolled
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had progressed on chemotherapy
that included a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan or oxaliplatin, or both. All
patients had tumors with 10% 11 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr)
staining by immunohistochemistry. Patients were stratified into 2 strata (high or
low staining intensity) and received intravenous panitumumab 2.5 mg/kg weekly
8 of every 9 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

espite significant improvements in prevention,
approximately 148,000 patients will develop colorectal cancer annually and 55,000 will die of the disease, rendering it the second most common cause of
cancer death in the US.1 Over the past decade the
introduction of new agents such as irinotecan,2 oxaliplatin,3 and bevacizumab (an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor)4,5 have prolonged
survival, yet nearly all tumors eventually progress. A
recent therapeutic approach for the treatment of colorectal cancer is the development of monoclonal
antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr).
The EGFr is a member of the erbB transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor family that is involved
in multiple cellular processes including growth, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis and which
may be dysregulated in malignant cells.6,7 Expression
of the EGFr is common in colorectal cancers and is
correlated with a worse outcome.8 Preclinical studies
with anti-EGFr agents have demonstrated growth inhibition of colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo.7,9 Trials with cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody, demonstrated antitumor
activity in patients with colorectal cancer who had
previously failed cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cetuximab
is currently indicated in this setting either in combination with irinotecan or as monotherapy.10,11 Toxicity was tolerable, with frequent skin rash and
occasional infusion reactions.
The murine component of chimeric monoclonal
antibodies is recognized as a potential source of immunogenicity and toxicity. Therefore, various strategies have been developed to minimize or eliminate
murine content. The XenoMouse is genetically engineered to express only human immunoglobulins.12
This technology was used to produce fully human
antibodies in mice immunized with A431 cells that
express high levels of EGFr. A resulting product,
panitumumab (ABX-EGF), is a fully human IgG2
monoclonal antibody.13 This high-affinity antibody
blocks EGFr-ligand binding and causes internalization
of the receptor.14,15 Preclinical studies showed that
panitumumab inhibited proliferation in multiple
EGFr-expressing cancer cell lines and inhibited growth
of xenografts.13
A phase 1 study of panitumumab given weekly
(QW), every 2 weeks (Q2W), and every 3 weeks
(Q3W) in patients with solid malignancies showed no
dose-limiting toxicities; all patients receiving more
than 2 mg/kg QW developed a rash. From pharmacokinetic evaluation, a loading dose was not required,
inter- and intrapatient variability was low, and clearance was saturable. Five patients responded, all with

981

colorectal cancer (n 5 39; 13%), and an additional 7
(18%) patients with colorectal cancer had stable disease.16,17 The QW dose for phase 2 testing was
selected based on expected target trough concentrations consistent with receptor saturation. We therefore
conducted a phase 2 trial of panitumumab in colorectal cancer patients whose tumors had progressed on
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This was a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized
phase 2 trial of panitumumab monotherapy for the
treatment of colorectal cancer in patients with EGFrexpressing metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were
assigned to 1 of 2 strata based on the level of EGFr
tumor membrane expression as determined by an
immunohistochemical kit (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif).
In Stratum A, patients had tumors with an EGFr
staining intensity of 21 or 31 in greater than 10% of
evaluated tumor cells (high EGFr expression). In Stratum B, patients had tumors with an EGFr staining intensity of 21 or 31 in less than 10% of evaluated
tumor cells (low EGFr expression; also required was
the sum of EGFr staining intensity of 11, 21, or 31
in greater than 10% of evaluated tumor cells). Stratum B was added as a protocol amendment; this
allowed for evaluation of the relation between high
and low EGFr tumor expression levels with panitumumab antitumor activity.
Eligibility
Eligible patients were 18 years old, had pathologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
colon or rectum, had bidimensionally measurable
disease, and a tumor tissue sample available for immunohistochemical measurement of EGFr expression. Patients had previously received 1 or more
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimens and
either irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or both. Patients also
had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 0 or 1 and adequate hematologic and organ function: absolute neutrophil count
1.5 3 109/L and platelet count 100 3 109/L; serum creatinine 2.2 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase 3
times the upper limit of normal; AST and ALT both
3 times the upper limit of normal (5 times if liver
metastases were present); and bilirubin 1.5 3 upper
limit of normal. Patients who had previously received
an EGFr-targeting agent or chemotherapy other than
a fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin were
excluded from the study.

Institutional review boards for each participating
center approved the study before initiation and
patients granted written informed consent before
any study-related procedures were performed.

Treatment
Panitumumab was produced using a hybridoma
expression system and was provided by Immunex
Corp. (a fully owned subsidiary of Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif). Panitumumab was administered
intravenously over 60 minutes at 2.5 mg/kg QW for 8
weeks followed by a 1-week rest (9-week cycle) until
disease progression or drug intolerability. Premedication was not required.
Panitumumab infusions were withheld in the
event of severe skin toxicity, including skin desquamation or exfoliation involving greater than 25% of
body surface area, generalized urticaria, or other skin
reactions requiring narcotics, systemic steroids, or
other intolerable toxicity. If the toxicities were
resolved (ie, patient no longer required systemic steroids or narcotics for rash, desquamation, or exfoliation was reduced to <25% of body surface area and
was improving, and skin-related toxicity resolved to
grade 2) within 3 weeks of a missed dose, panitumumab could be reinstated at 1.5 mg/kg QW and
increased to 2.0 mg/kg weekly subsequently as tolerated. If the toxicity still met the dose-limiting criteria
after 3 weeks or subsequently recurred after reinstitution of therapy, treatment would be permanently
discontinued.
Assessments
Physical examination, performance status, and a serum sample for antihuman panitumumab antibodies
were taken once per course at Week 1. Vital signs
were monitored before panitumumab infusion, during, and at intervals after the completion of infusion.
Scans for tumor assessment were taken during the
ninth week and every 9 weeks thereafter. Response
was assessed by centralized independent review
(RadPharm, Princeton, NJ) using the RECIST criteria.18 Responses were confirmed 4 weeks after the
response criteria were first met. Stable disease was
assessed at the first scheduled assessment. Disease
control rates were the sum of the objective response
and stable disease rates.
Serum antipanitumumab antibody levels were
measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) with a sensitivity of 10 ng/mL
(Amgen). The ELISA included an acid dissociation
step to disrupt antibody-panitumumab complexes
before detection.

For pharmacokinetic analyses, serum panitumumab samples were obtained both pre- and post-dose
at specified timepoints throughout the study.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was objective tumor response
after the initial 8-week treatment. After the addition
of Stratum B, the sample size was increased from
100 patients to 150 patients; this increased the study
power from 80% to 91% and would produce a 2sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.2% to 14.8%
for the objective response rate at 8 weeks if a point
estimate of 10% was to be observed.19
Secondary endpoints included best overall objective tumor response, progression-free survival, overall
survival, incidence of adverse events, and pharmacokinetics. All patients who received at least 1 dose of
study drug were included in the efficacy and safety
analyses. Fisher exact test was used to compare
response rates between strata. Time-to-event outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method,
with standard censoring rules; a 2-sided log rank test
was used to compare progression-free survival and
overall survival between strata. Adverse events were
graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) v. 2.0.
Exploratory analyses evaluating the association of
worst grade of skin toxicity with objective response,
progression-free survival, and overall survival were
conducted. Patients were included in these analyses if
they were progression-free for at least 28 days (to
avoid lead-time bias). Day 28 was selected because
skin-rash onset was frequently observed before Day
28.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between March 2002 and July 2003, 150 patients
from 380 screened candidates were enrolled among
17 institutions. The most common reasons for screen
failure were the inability to meet the EGFr staining
criterion (52% of patients) and inadequate hepatic
function (15% of patients). Two patients never
received treatment with panitumumab; 1 patient did
not have adequate hepatic function and the other
patient was lost to follow-up. Thus, 148 patients
were assessed for safety and efficacy. One hundred
five patients (71%) had high EGFr expression levels
(Stratum A) and 43 patients (29%) had low EGFr
expression (Stratum B).
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between the 2 strata (Table 1). Most
patients were male and white; all patients had an

ECOG score of 0 or 1. The median age was 59.5
years. The number of previous chemotherapy regimens ranged from 1 to 7. All patients had received a
fluoropyrimidine (most commonly 5-fluorouracil),
95% had received irinotecan, and 49% had received
oxaliplatin. Seventy-five patients (51%) had received
a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan (double failures),
and 65 patients (44%) had received all 3 agents together or in various combinations (triple failures).

Efficacy
Objective response rates
After 8 weeks of treatment, 10 of 148 patients (7%;
95% CI, 3–12) had a partial response by central
review (Table 2). The overall response rate by central
assessment was 9% (95% CI, 5–15) (Table 2). The
overall stable disease rate was 29% and the overall
disease control rate was 38%. The response rates

983

were not significantly different by EGFr staining stratum (P 5 .20 by Fisher 2-sided exact test; by central
review, 7% for high EGFr1 and 14% for low EGFr1).
Response and stable disease rates by local assessment were similar.
An exploratory analysis was performed on both
prior chemotherapy subgroups, double failures
(n 5 75 patients), and triple failures (n 5 65 patients).
Across the entire study the response rate was 8% (95%
CI, 3–17) in the double failures and 11% (95% CI, 4–
21) in the triple failures. These rates were similar to
the overall study response rate.

Progression-free and overall survival
At the time of this analysis, 95% of patients had a
progression-free survival event and 89% of patients
had a death event. Median progression-free survival
time was 14 (95% CI, 8–16) weeks. No significant differences in progression-free survival were observed
between Stratum A (high EGFr) and Stratum B (low
EGFr) (Fig. 1, top). Median overall survival time was
8.6 (95% CI, 5.9–9.8) months with no differences
observed between strata (Fig. 1, bottom).
An exploratory analysis examined the association
of skin toxicity with outcome. Of the 13 responders,
2 patients had a maximum grade of 0–1, and 11 had
a maximum grade of 2–4. Among nonresponders, 60
patients had a maximum grade of 0–1 and 65 had a
maximum grade of 2–4. Patients with a maximum
skin toxicity of grade 2–4 had better progression-free
survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50–0.90)
and overall survival (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54–0.97)
compared with those with a maximum grade of 0–1
(Fig. 2).
Safety
The most common adverse events are shown in
Table 3. Four patients (3%) died during treatment;
none of these deaths were considered related to
panitumumab. One patient had an infusion reaction
with severe dyspnea, flushing, and rigors after the
second infusion of panitumumab and received meperidine, lorazepam, and diphenhydramine. This
patient received 2 additional weekly infusions of
panitumumab with premedication without further
events.
As expected given the biology of EGFr inhibitors,
skin-related adverse events were common, but were
seldom severe. The most common toxicities involving
the integument were rash, pruritus, dry skin, and
dermatitis (Table 3). Overall, 95% of patients experienced a skin-related toxicity during treatment; these
rashes were generally described as follicular, macular,
and/or papular. Most were grade 1 or 2 in severity.

Not done, scans were not available (patients discontinued treatment before their first assessment or did not come in for the disease assessment).

Four patients required narcotic analgesics to treat
rash-associated pain and 5 were given systemic steroids for symptomatic relief. Four patients required
permanent discontinuation because of nailbed infection or rash. Four patients required dose alterations
because of rash and pruritus. Eye-related toxicities
occurred in 27 (18%) of patients, with the most frequent being conjunctivitis in 6% of patients.
Median time to worst skin-related toxicity was 12
(95% CI, 9–14) days. Median duration of grade 3 and
4 skin-related toxicities was 20 (95% CI, 10-NE) days.
Fatigue was reported in approximately 50% of
patients and was grade 3 or higher in 9% of patients.
Mild-to-moderate nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain,
and vomiting were also observed. Mild transient
decreases in serum potassium were seen in 13% of
patients. Serum magnesium levels were not formally
collected in this study; however, hypomagnesemia
was reported in 4 patients (3%): 3 with grade 1 severity and 1 with grade 2 severity.
Eight patients (5%) discontinued treatment
because of an adverse event. In 4 (3%) of these
patients the events were considered related to panitumumab: grade 3 fatigue, grade 1 nailbed infection,
grade 3 rash, and grade 2 rash. The other events
were either unrelated disorders or manifestations of
the primary disease.
Of the 148 treated patients, 142 had a predose
baseline sample for antibody evaluation. No baseline
sample tested seropositive for antihuman panitumumab antibodies. One hundred seven patients had 1
or more postdose samples (taken either during treat-

ment or during follow-up) tested for antipanitumumab antibodies. None were detected in any samples.

Pharmacokinetics
Serum panitumumab concentrations throughout the
study are shown in Figure 3. After 1 dose of panitumumab the mean trough concentration (Cmin) was
above the IC90 from xenograft models.16 Mean concentrations of panitumumab at steady state were
approximately 55 lg/mL at trough and 120 lg/mL at
peak. No apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of panitumumab were observed between the
strata.

DISCUSSION
These data demonstrate that panitumumab as a single agent has clinical activity in patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer. In 148 patients
receiving weekly panitumumab, the response rate
was 9% and progression-free survival was 14 weeks.
The number of prior regimens did not appear to
affect the response rate. Treatment was well tolerated, with mild to moderate skin rash being common. These clinical results appear similar to those
observed with cetuximab, with single-agent response
rates of 8.8 to 10.8%.10,11 Furthermore, Van Cutsem
et al.20 recently described results of a randomized
clinical trial of panitumumab compared with best
supportive care that showed an improvement in progression-free survival with panitumumab. On the basis of the results of this randomized trial,

panitumumab was recently approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients who progressed
after fluoropyrimidine-, irinotecan-, and oxaliplatincontaining chemotherapy.21 As with cetuximab, the
incidence and severity of rash in our study appears
to be associated with response and progression-free
survival, whereas EGFr staining level does not.22
Treatment with panitumumab resulted in few
severe toxicities. Fatigue was the only grade 3–4 event
that occurred in greater than 5% of patients. Integumentary side effects, presumably because of EGFr inhibition in skin,7 are nearly universal but rarely lead to
drug discontinuation. Treatment of EGFr rash usually
consists of antibiotics or topical steroids but remains
anecdotal and is ripe for rigorous investigation.
Panitumumab is the first fully human anti-EGFr
antibody to reach advanced clinical evaluation in

patients with cancer. It was developed with the rationale that a fully human antibody would be less
immunogenic.13 Monotherapy with the chimeric
antibody cetuximab results in severe infusion reactions in 3% of patients.23 No antipanitumumab antibodies were detected in this study. Only a single
infusion reaction was reported, which did not require
treatment discontinuation.
The selection of a weekly dose and schedule of
panitumumab for this study was largely based on
xenograft modeling data and safety results from the
phase 1 monotherapy panitumumab study available
at the time of study inception.16,17 The approved
dosage of panitumumab is 6.0 mg/kg Q2W.21 Current
clinical data suggest similar activity with both schedules in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer
patients.20,24
One important limitation to this study is the discrepancy in missing scans as reported by central versus local review, 21% versus 5%, respectively (Table

2). The missing assessments by central review were a
consequence of multiple factors, including scans not
sent by the investigator to the central facility, inadequate treatment duration, and/or early disease progression. This did not affect the response rate, as per
protocol, patients with missing scans were considered nonresponders and all 148 patients treated were

included in the denominator for response rate calculations.
Ongoing clinical development of panitumumab in
patients with colorectal cancer will address the activity of combinations with chemotherapy, less frequent
dosing schedules, and use as initial treatment of metastatic disease.16,25–27 Given preclinical and clinical
evidence of augmented activity when EGFr and VEGF
inhibitors are administered together,28,29 a randomized phase 3 trial was undertaken to examine the
addition of panitumumab to standard chemotherapy
and bevacizumab in previously untreated metastatic
colorectal cancer (the PACCE trial).30 A recent press
release from the study sponsor based on an interim
analysis indicated a negative effect on progressionfree and overall survival with the addition of panitumumab31; the implications of this announcement for
the development of antibody combinations must
await full data presentation and analysis.
Because EGFr monoclonal antibodies appear to
benefit only a minority of patients, there is a pressing
need to identify the characteristics of patients and
tumors most likely to respond to this treatment. Skin
rash appears to serve as a surrogate pharmacodynamic marker, but cannot be used for patient selection. As EGFr expression by immunohistochemistry

Panitumumab for Metastatic Colorectal CA/Hecht et al.

is not predictive,22,26,32 alternate markers are being
sought. Although EGFr mutations have been associated with response in lung cancers to small molecule TK inhibitors, these mutations are uncommon
in colorectal cancer.33–36 Preliminary evidence that
EGFr gene amplification, lack of KRAS mutation, or
ligand expression may predict for response to antiEGFr antibodies has been suggested and requires
confirmation.37–39 Given the myriad of treatment
options, each with modest activity, there is a great
opportunity and need to conduct studies that will
help guide the rational selection of these agents for
individual patients.
