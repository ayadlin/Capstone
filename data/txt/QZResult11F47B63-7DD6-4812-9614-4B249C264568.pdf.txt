BACKGROUND: Clinical trials indicate that rituximab improves the survival of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
Economic models using multiple data sources, including clinical trials for survival outcomes, have projected cost offsets/savings and
favorable cost-effectiveness associated with rituximab. In this study, the authors evaluated survival and cost impacts of adding rituximab to first-line chemotherapy for DLBCL using a single database that reflects routine clinical practice among elderly patients in the
United States. METHODS: By using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data linked to Medicare, the authors identified
5484 elderly patients who were diagnosed with DLBCL between January 1999 and December 2005 who had claims through December 2007. Included patients began chemotherapy with or without rituximab within 180 days of diagnosis. Multivariate analyses were
conducted to estimate the impact of rituximab on mortality and costs to Medicare. The cost per life-year gained of rituximab was calculated using cost and survival estimates from the multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 76 years, 43% of
patients had stage III or IV disease, and 64% received rituximab. In a Cox regression model, rituximab resulted in lower 4-year allcause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.74) and cancer mortality, and the incremental cumulative survival was 0.37 years. In least-squares regression, rituximab resulted in higher 4-year total costs ($23,097; 95% CI, $19,129$27,298), immunochemotherapy costs ($12,069; 95% CI, $10,687-$13,634), other cancer costs ($7655; 95% CI, $5067-$10,489), and
noncancer costs ($3461; 95% CI, $1319-$5650). The cost per life-year gained was $62,424. CONCLUSIONS: In routine clinical practice,
rituximab was associated with survival benefits comparable to those observed in clinical trials. However, these benefits did not transC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with an estimated prevalence of 129,500 and an incidence of 21,800 in the United States.1,2 A disproportionate number of patients
with DLBCL are aged 65 years, accounting for approximately 50% of prevalent cases and 59% of incident cases, and
58% of the incident cases are diagnosed in patients aged 75 years at diagnosis.1,2 DLBCL is an aggressive subtype of
NHL, and practice guidelines recommend induction chemotherapy plus the monoclonal antibody rituximab in most
instances.3 It has been demonstrated in clinical trials of DLBCL4-7 that the addition of rituximab to first-line chemotherapy improves progression-free and overall survival in older patients, in which the reported risk ratios for all-cause mortality
range from 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.77)4 to 0.72 (95% CI, 0.52-1.00),5 and in younger patients.6
However, even in trials of older patients, the majority were aged <75 years4,5; and, because older age is a prognostic factor
for a poor outcome in aggressive lymphoma, the survival impact of rituximab in an older population in routine clinical
practice reasonably may be expected to differ from that reported in those trials.
Like many countries, the United States is struggling with the financial burden associated with cancer and its treatment, and nowhere is this more apparent than within Medicare, where spending on Part B drugs, a category dominated
by those used to treat cancer, rose 367% from $3 billion in 1997 to $11 billion in 2004.8 Rituximab also is approved for

follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and
rheumatoid arthritis. In 2009, rituximab accounted for
the largest percent of Medicare Part B expenditures
(7.8%) of any drug administered in physicians’ offices or
furnished by suppliers.9 Efficacy notwithstanding, rituximab adds considerably to the cost of first-line therapy in
NHL, with published estimates of $15,600 in follicular
lymphoma10 and $17,200 in DLBCL.11 Given the added
drug cost, there has been considerable interest in evaluating the net cost impact and cost-effectiveness of rituximab
in DLBCL, taking into account its effects on progressionfree and overall survival.11-15 Published estimates of the
net cost impact range from €700 in Italy,14 indicating
that the cost savings associated with improved outcomes
offset completely the treatment costs of rituximab, to
þ€15,900 in the Netherlands.12 The only study conducted in the United States projected a net cost impact of
$12,374 over 6 years, which equated to cost offsets of
$4491 because of lower salvage and end-of-life care.11
However, all of those projections were based on computer
models that incorporated data from multiple sources,
including clinical trials for survival data. Consequently,
they may not reflect the cost impact of rituximab in routine clinical practice, in which practice patterns, patients,
and survival outcomes may differ from those trial reports.
The objectives of the current study were to evaluate
the survival, cost, and cost-effectiveness impacts of adding
rituximab to first-line chemotherapy for DLBCL using a
single source of data that reflects routine clinical practice
in elderly patients and also the perspective of the largest
single payer of medical care for DLBCL patients in the
United States.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

The source of data for this study was the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) cancer registry linked to Medicare administrative and claims data.16 Currently, SEER contains cancer incidence and survival data from 17 population-based
cancer registries throughout the United States that cover
approximately 28% of the population.17 In the SEERMedicare database, cancer registry data are linked to Medicare enrollment and claims data, which are available for
93% of individuals aged 65 years in the SEER registry.18 Medicare claims include hospital short-stay and
long-stay, skilled nursing facility, physician/supplier,
institutional outpatient, home health agency, and durable
medical equipment.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Patients were included if they were diagnosed with
DLBCL19 between January 1, 1999 and December 31,
2005, if DLBCL was the first primary cancer diagnosed,
and if their first Medicare claim for immunochemotherapy was 180 days after diagnosis. To ensure complete
claims history, patients had to be enrolled in a Medicare
fee-for-service plan, with no health maintenance organization (HMO) coverage, for 12 months before DLBCL
diagnosis. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: diagnosis before age 65 years, diagnosis made by
death certificate or autopsy, death within the first month
after diagnosis, or Medicare enrollment <12 months
before diagnosis.
Patients and Variables

Patients were described according to their demographic,
clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics. Requiring eligible patients to have at least 1 year of Medicare enrollment before diagnosis meant that the minimum age in the
cohort was 66 years. Patients were classified by disease
stage and extranodal involvement (yes/no).
Medicare claims do not contain the results of laboratory tests, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level,
which is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in the International Prognostic Index (IPI) for
DLBCL.20 Another prognostic factor for overall survival
in the IPI that is not included in SEER-Medicare is Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status.21 In the absence of performance status, we used
Medicare claims to identify several predictors of poor performance status,22 including the use of oxygen and related
respiratory therapy supplies, wheelchair and supplies,
home health agency, and skilled nursing facility, all from
12 months before until 30 days after DLBCL diagnosis.
Individual services were combined into a score of 0 (none)
or 1 (use of any service). Medicare claims also were used
to identify anemia23 and to calculate an NCI comorbidity
index score for each patient.24,25
SEER-Medicare contains information from the
2000 Census, reported at the tract level in which the
patient lives, for the percentage of the population living in
poverty and the percentage of those aged 25 years with
some college. We used these as indicators of the socioeconomic status of individual patients in the cohort. The
assigned metropolitan statistical area was used as a
geographic indicator.

Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) ‘‘J’’ codes for chemotherapy (J9000-J9999) or rituximab (J9310) within 30
days after the first such claim.26,27 Patients were then classified as having received chemotherapy with or without
rituximab as first-line therapy on the basis of these claims.
In addition, we identified specific chemotherapy agents
used, consisting of cyclophosphamide (J8530, J9070,
J9080, J9090-J9097), doxorubicin (J9000, J9001), vincristine (J9370, J9375, J9380), and mitoxantrone
(J9293), according to treatment guidelines.3 These claims
were used to classify chemotherapy regimens; eg, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
(CHOP); cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine,
and prednisone (CNOP); or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). Medicare did not begin covering oral therapies without an intravenous equivalent
until January 2006. In the absence of data on oral therapy,
the use of prednisone was assumed when the other agents
were present.
Follow-Up and Survival

Patients were followed from the start of first-line therapy
until death, the end of their claims (December 31, 2007),
or until they switched to HMO coverage, whichever came
first. Cause of death was classified as death caused by cancer of any type or noncancer causes. Noncancer causes
included all other identified causes of death, such as heart
disease or diabetes. It excluded missing or unspecified
cause of death. These patients were censored at the time of
death in both cancer and noncancer survival analyses.
Cost

Direct medical costs to Medicare were calculated using
paid amounts from claims. Diagnosis and procedure
codes within claims were used to identify 3 mutually
exclusive categories of costs: immunochemotherapy,26,27
other cancer care (any claim with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] diagnosis code from 140.xx to 208.xx
[malignant neoplasms], but no code for immunochemotherapy), and noncancer care (any other claim). Paid
amounts were inflated to 2009 US dollars.28
Statistical Analysis

Multivariate survival analysis was performed using Cox
proportional hazards regression. Patients who received rituximab tended to be diagnosed in later years. Therefore,
the primary survival analysis was limited to 4 years. However, additional survival analyses were conducted using
the entire observation period, with cancer and noncancer
mortality as the outcomes, and restricting the cohort to
those who received CHOP or CNOP, because the intent
Cancer

of treating with CHOP may have differed from treating
with CVP or other regimens. All survival analyses were
then repeated using propensity score analysis,29 which
entailed using propensity score quintile in lieu of all other
independent variables except treatment in the survival
analyses. Finally, we constructed an adjusted KaplanMeier curve of the difference in survival between the 2
first-line treatment groups using inverse probability of
treatment weighting.30
We performed partitioned, inverse probabilityweighted (IPW), least-squares regression analysis31,32 to
examine adjusted associations between cumulative costs
over 4 years (48 partitions) and patient demographic, clinical, and treatment factors. Separate regression analysis
was performed for each of the partitions. Coefficients for
each patient factor were summed across the partitions to
obtain the cumulative, incremental cost associated with
that factor. Confidence intervals for the cumulative cost
coefficients were calculated using a bootstrap approach,33
in which the process of performing each partitioned
regression analysis and summing coefficients across partitions was repeated 1000 times using sampling with
replacement from the original cohort. The cost analysis
was limited to 4 years to match the time horizon for the
primary survival analysis and because excessive differential
censoring by treatment group resulting from comparing a
newer to an older treatment can result in biased regression
coefficients.
The cost per life-year gained from rituximab plus
chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone was
calculated by dividing the total incremental cumulative
cost in the rituximab group by the total incremental cumulative survival at 48 months after the beginning of
first-line treatment. In addition to performing analyses
across the entire cohort, we then stratified the cohort by
ages 66 to 80 years versus age >80 years at diagnosis,
and we repeated the multivariate analyses of 4-year total
cost and survival.
RESULTS
There were 5484 patients in the final cohort: 3531 (64%)
received rituximab plus chemotherapy, and 1953 (36%)
received chemotherapy alone (Table 1). The mean age at
diagnosis was 76 years, 56% were aged >75 years, 43%
had stage III/IV disease, 37% had extranodal involvement, and 22% had 1 indicator of poor performance
status. Patients who received rituximab were diagnosed
later in the study period and were less likely to have
immunoblastic histology or 1 indicator of poor
performance.

Treatment

Overall, 82% of patients (4510) received CHOP or
CNOP as first-line chemotherapy, and the proportions
were similar in the rituximab plus chemotherapy (83%)
and chemotherapy alone (81%) groups. In the rituximab
group, the mean number of rituximab administrations
billed to Medicare during first-line therapy was 5.5 (median, 5 administrations; interquartile range [IQR], 4-7
administrations), and the average number of units (1 unit,

units; IQR, 6-8 units).
Survival

There were 2815 deaths, of which 1649 (58.6%) were
classified as cancer, 1044 (37.1%) were classified as noncancer, and 122 (4.3%), were classified as missing or
unknown. The median (IQR) survival was 66 months

alone. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated similar incremental survival benefits of rituximab for patients who received
CHOP or CNOP and those who received other chemotherapy regimens, primarily CVP (Table 2, Fig. 1).
In multivariate survival analysis, rituximab was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality at 4
years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61-0.74; P <
.0001) (Table 3). In the multivariate survival analysis
stratified by age, rituximab was associated with lower allcause mortality in patients aged 80 years (HR, 0.67;
95% CI, 0.60-0.75) and in patients aged >80 years (HR,
0.72; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84), with considerable overlap in
the CIs. The cumulative incremental survival associated
with rituximab was 0.37 years after 4 years. Women and
patients with immunoblastic histology also were associated with lower mortality (P  .05). Older age, stage III/

higher mortality. In the analysis of cumulative survival
stratified by age, rituximab was associated with an incremental survival benefit of 0.37 years in patients aged 80
and 0.41 years in patients aged >80 years, a difference of
approximately 15 days between the 2 age groups.
Results from multivariate survival analyses using the
entire observation period and using propensity score analysis (Fig. 2) were comparable to the primary analyses.
Also, rituximab was associated with significantly lower
cancer mortality, but not noncancer mortality, using both
standard multivariate and propensity score analysis (Fig.
2). Results of the multivariate survival analysis that was restricted to patients who received CHOP or CNOP (n ¼
4510) were similar to those that included all patients
(results not shown).
Costs

The mean (standard deviation) cost of first-line therapy
was $24,431  $21,379 in the rituximab group
and $13,230  $18,635 for the chemotherapy alone
group. In multivariate analysis, rituximab was associated
with significantly higher 4-year total costs ($23,097; 95%
CI, $19,129-$27,298), immunochemotherapy costs
($12,069; 95% CI, $10,687-$13,634), other cancer costs
($7655; 95% CI, $5067-$10,489), and noncancer costs
($3461; 95% CI $1319-$5650), and immunochemotherapy (first-line plus subsequent) accounted for approximately 53% of the total. In the rituximab group, 65%
($14,918/$23,097) of the total incremental cost accrued
during the first 6 months (Fig. 3). This was driven primarily by the cost of immunochemotherapy and, secondarily,
by the costs of other cancer-related services. Noncancer
costs in the rituximab group became statistically significantly higher only after month 35, consistent with
improved survival.
Results from the multivariate analysis of total 4-year
costs that included only patients who received CHOP or
CNOP were similar to those from the analysis that

DISCUSSION
Clinical trials demonstrated that first-line rituximab plus
chemotherapy resulted in improved survival for patients
with DLBCL.4-7 In our study, the HR for all-cause mortality at 4 years was 0.68, compared with a range from
0.534 to 0.725 reported in clinical trials of older patients,
although the patients in our study were considerably older
than the patients in those trials. For example, in the phase
3 trial reported by Coiffier et al,4 only 20% of patients
were aged 75 years, compared with >56% of the Medicare patients in our study. Our results were robust to
changing the length of the observation period, restricting
to patients who received CHOP or CNOP, and using
propensity score techniques. Also, HRs were similar for
those aged 80 years and those aged >80 years at diagnosis, indicating that the survival benefits observed in clinical
trials also are realized in the very elderly patients in routine
clinical practice. SEER does not include information on
cancer relapse. Therefore, we did not examine relapse-free
or progression-free survival.
Several economic analyses of first-line rituximab for
DLBCL have projected cost offsets or outright savings
related to improved clinical outcomes.11-15 Most were
based on computer models that incorporated data from
multiple sources, including survival data from clinical trials. On the basis of the published economic literature, in
the rituximab group, we expected to observe higher
immunochemotherapy costs during first-line therapy, followed by lower costs after first-line therapy because of
lower rates of second-line treatment for relapse. In our
study, immunochemotherapy costs did increase during
the first 6 months, but to a lower level than expected based
on the cost of rituximab itself. One possible explanation is
that the mean number of rituximab administrations was
lower (5.5 administrations) than expected6-8 based on
clinical practice guidelines.3 From 7 months to 48
months, the incremental costs of immunochemotherapy
were approximately zero, suggesting that any underlying
differences in progression/relapse rates did not have an
impact on the costs of second-line therapy. We also
expected to observe lower incremental costs associated
with other types of cancer care and noncancer care.
Instead, we observed that the costs of other cancer care
rose steeply during the initial treatment phase and then

Figure 2. Multivariate (MV) survival analyses are illustrated from a sensitivity analysis of hazard ratios for rituximab plus chemotherapy. These are results from 3 sets (all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and noncancer mortality) of 4 multivariate survival
analyses (2 for survival during the entire observation period and 2 for survival during the first 4 years of follow-up) that were
designed to test the sensitivity of the findings reported in Table 3 to changes in the specification of the outcome variable as well
as the approach to multivariate analysis. Standard multivariate survival analyses were performed with all individual patient variables included in the model. Propensity multivariate survival analyses were performed with propensity score quintile included in
the model as a substitute for all patient variables except treatment. An asterisk indicates that the full results from this analysis
are reported in Table 3. The y-axis indicates the hazard ratio for rituximab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy
alone. Triangles represent the estimated hazard ratio for rituximab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone from
the corresponding model on the x-axis. Bars around each triangle represent the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence
interval for the hazard ratio. Confidence intervals that overlap the horizontal line at a hazard ratio of 1.0 indicate that the estimated hazard ratio for rituximab plus chemotherapy is not significant at P ¼ .05.

continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate, after the end of
first-line therapy. A possible explanation for the early rise
is that, because rituximab use was more common later in
the study period, the rituximab coefficient picked up the
costs of any supportive care (eg, granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor) that was more likely to be used later in the
study period, although we adjusted for year of diagnosis in
all the multivariate analyses. Indeed, during the first 6
months, the most frequent claims for other cancer services
were for infused therapies, such as corticosteroids, granulocyte-colony–stimulating factors, erythropoietin, and
antiemetics. Also, because the assignment of costs to these
categories was based on diagnosis and procedure codes in
claims, it is possible that the diagnosis of cancer was ‘‘carried forward’’ on claims for services unrelated to cancer.
We observed a gradual increase in the incremental cost of
noncancer care in the rituximab group, until the cumulative difference became statistically significant in year 4.
This is consistent with the finding that patients who
received rituximab survived longer; and, in an elderly
Cancer

population, cancer survivors would continue to incur
medical costs related to other conditions. Incremental
total costs of adding rituximab to chemotherapy were
lower in those aged >80 years compared with those aged
80 years at diagnosis, although incremental survival
benefits were similar. This may have been caused by
differences in the rituximab regimen between the 2 groups
and/or to the finding that overall expected survival is
shorter in the very elderly.
Like any study that uses observational data to examine the outcomes of therapies or other interventions, in
this study, the main threat to the validity of our findings is
selection bias, in which unobserved factors influence both
treatment selection and the outcome of interest.34 SEERMedicare does not contain data on LDH or ECOG performance status—2 of the 5 prognostic factors for
DLBCL overall survival that are included in the IPI.20 In
lieu of ECOG performance status, we included a claimsbased indicator of poor performance status.22 In the
multivariate survival and cost analyses, we did observe

that the presence of 1 indicator of poor performance
was associated with a 45% higher risk of mortality and
with $4774 higher total cost. Also, we observed significant
differences in survival and/or cost according to disease
stage, histology, extranodal involvement, the presence of
anemia, and NCI comorbidity index. It is important to
note that any variable constructed using claims for medical services, such as performance status and NCI comorbidity index, that is included in a multivariate cost
analysis has a greater likelihood of being statistically significant simply by virtue of the finding that most claims
have a cost attached.
In the current study, patients who were diagnosed in
later years were more likely to receive rituximab. This may
have introduced several possible sources of bias, including
differential observation and censoring and secular trends
in both the assignment of patients to different chemotherapy regimens and in the use of supportive care. In the survival and cost analyses, we limited the observation period
to reduce differential censoring. We used IPW in the estimation of cumulative incremental survival. In the cost
6086

analysis, we used IPW and established separate weights for
the 2 treatment groups to account for differential censoring between the 2 groups. Also, we included year of diagnosis as a covariate in all of the survival and cost models to
adjust for temporal differences in patterns of care.
Most patients in both first-line treatment groups
received CHOP chemotherapy. Therefore, we did not
include type of chemotherapy in the primary analyses.
When we restricted the cohort to those who received
CHOP or CNOP, the survival and cost coefficients for
the rituximab groups were similar to those in the primary
analyses. One indicator of selection bias in survival analysis is treatment differences in noncancer survival that are
as large as, or larger than, differences in cancer survival.34
In the analysis of cancer and noncancer mortality, we
observed that the survival benefit was limited to cancer
mortality.
In routine clinical practice, the comparative effectiveness of adding rituximab to first-line chemotherapy
for elderly patients who are diagnosed with DLBCL is
similar to its efficacy as measured in randomized trials.

This applied to both elderly and very elderly patients.
However, the survival benefits observed in this study did
not translate into cost offsets or savings as previously
reported by several studies in the peer-reviewed literature.
Although these findings confirm the clinical benefits of
rituximab, they suggest that it may not be realistic to
expect effective new cancer therapies to attenuate the rising costs of cancer care in routine clinical practice, especially for populations in which multiple comorbidities are
common.
