Abstract
Lung cancer is the commonest cancer killer. Small cell lung
cancer (SCLC) is initially chemosensitive, but rapidly relapses
in a chemoresistant form with an overall survival of <5%. Consequently, novel therapies are urgently required and will likely
arise from an improved understanding of the disease biology.
Our previous work showed that fibroblast growth factor-2 induces proliferation and chemoresistance in SCLC cells. Here,
we show that the selective fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR) inhibitor PD173074 blocks H-510 and H-69 SCLC proliferation and clonogenic growth in a dose-dependent fashion
and prevents FGF-2–induced chemoresistance. These effects
correlate with the inhibition of both FGFR1 and FGFR2 transphosphorylation. We then determined the efficacy of daily
oral administration of PD173074 for 28 days in two human
SCLC models. In the H-510 xenograft, tumor growth was impaired similar to that seen with single-agent cisplatin administration, increasing median survival compared with control
sham–treated animals. Crucially, the effect of cisplatin was
significantly potentiated by coadministration of PD173074.
More dramatically, in H-69 xenografts, PD173074 induced
complete responses lasting >6 months in 50% of mice. These
effects were not a consequence of disrupted tumor vasculature
but instead correlated with increased apoptosis (caspase 3
and cytokeratin 18 cleavage) in excised tumors. Moreover,
in vivo imaging with 3′-deoxy-3′-[18F]fluorothymidine–positron emission tomography ([18F]FLT-PET) showed decreased
intratumoral proliferation in live animals treated with the
compound at 7 to 14 days. Our results suggest that clinical
trials of FGFR inhibitors should be undertaken in patients with
SCLC and that [ 18 F]FLT-PET imaging could provide early
in vivo evidence of response. [Cancer Res 2009;69(22):8645–51]

Introduction
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 20% of all lung malignancies. Despite initial chemosensitivity, the disease recurs rapidly in a form usually resistant to further therapy and so overall
survival is <5% at 3 years. Consequently, novel therapies are urgently required and these will most likely arise from an improved

understanding of the disease biology. There is now considerable
evidence implicating multiple growth factors that act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to drive SCLC proliferation (1–5). In particular, our laboratory has established the role of basic-fibroblast
growth factor (FGF-2) in this disease (6–9).
FGF-2 is a mitogen and a survival factor in many experimental
models and is involved in neoangiogenesis in vivo (10–12). These
effects are of potential relevance in cancer biology, and the inhibition of FGF-2 signaling may provide a valuable target to control
tumor development. PD173074, a previously described ATP pocket
inhibitor (13), is reported to show both high affinity and selectivity
for the FGF receptor (FGFR) family. However, its selectivity has
only been examined against a limited number of kinases. When
used in vivo, this compound was shown to inhibit FGF-driven
neoangiogenesis while being exempt of general toxicity (13, 14).
Therefore, PD173074 is perceived as a promising compound for
in vivo inhibition of FGF signaling.
We have previously shown that FGF-2 induces SCLC cell proliferation and resistance to cytotoxic drugs (7, 9). Here, we show that
both these effects are blocked by PD173074. This correlated with
inhibition of FGFR1 and FGFR2 autophosphorylation and the subsequent phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in response to FGF-2. An extended in vitro kinase screen (78 kinases) confirmed selectivity
of the inhibitor. Crucially, PD173074 inhibited tumor growth in
two different SCLC xenograft models (H510 and H69), with 50%
disease-free survival at 1 year in the case of H69 and tumor control
similar to that achieved with chemotherapy (cisplatin) in H510
tumors. Indeed, PD173074 treatment decreased intratumoral proliferation as shown by in vivo [18F]fluorothymidine–positron emission tomography ([ 18 F]FLT-PET) studies while increasing the
appearance of apoptotic cell death markers in tumor biopsies.
Moreover, coadministration of the drug enhanced response to cisplatin in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibition of
FGFR kinase activity, while improving response to classic therapeutic agents, could be efficient as a monotherapy for a subset
of lung cancer patients.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. H510 and H69 SCLC cell lines were maintained as previously described (7). For experimental purposes, the cells were grown in
serum-free medium (SITA: RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 μg/mL insulin,
10 μg/mL transferrin, 30 nmol/L sodium selenite, and 0.25% bovine serum
albumin) and used after 3 to 7 d.
FGFR transphosphorylation. H510 cells in SITA were treated in the
presence or absence of 10 nmol/L PD173074 for 1 h before stimulation with
or without 0.1 ng/mL FGF-2 for 2 min. Immunokinase assay and autoradiography were performed as described (7).

Figure 1. Expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in a panel of SCLC cells and
inhibition by PD173074. A, equal protein amounts from SCLC cell lines were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting for their FGFR1 and FGFR2
expression levels. B, H510 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L PD173074
for 1 h before stimulation with or without 0.1 ng/mL FGF-2 for 2 min and
immunocomplex transphosphorylation assay. All data shown are representative
of at least three independent experiments.

Clonogenic assay. H510 cells in SITA were disaggregated into a singlecell suspension and mixed with 0.1 ng/mL FGF-2 and PD173074 at the concentration indicated. Clonogenic assay was then performed over a period of
3 wk as described (7).
Cell proliferation assay. H510 and H69 (1.5 × 104 cells/mL) in SITA
were treated with or without FGF-2; PD173074 for the duration and at
the concentration highlighted in the figure legends. Cell number was determined by cell counting as described (7).
Cell death assay. H510 cells (5 × 104 cells/mL SITA) were pretreated
with or without 10 nmol/L PD173074 for 1 h before addition of 0.1 ng/mL
FGF-2 for 4 h and subsequent treatment with 0.1 μmol/L etoposide. Cells
were then incubated at 37°C for 96 h. Cell number was determined by cell
counting under the microscope using trypan blue exclusion.
RNAi transfection. FGFR1/2 knockdown was achieved using Dharmacon Smartpools and electroporation as described (9).
Xenografts and immunohistochemistry. H510 (1:1 cell suspension;
Matrigel) or H69 cells were implanted into the flank of nude mice. When
tumors became measurable, 50 mg/kg PD173074/mice or equivalent vol-

ume of buffer alone were administered daily for 14 or 28 d. In addition,
mice received or did not receive two doses of 5 mg/kg cisplatin. Tumor
volume was monitored using a calliper. Animals were sacrificed when tumor burden reached 15 mm in any dimension and survival recorded as a
Kaplan-Meier plot. Tissues were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded before staining as indicated in the figure legends. For the endomucin experiments, pictures were acquired using a ×10 objective and analyzed using
ImageJ. For activated Caspase 3 and cytokeratin 18 scoring, the number
of positive cells in five high-power field views/tumor (five tumors
per condition) was determined and results represented as bar graphs
(Fig. 5C, bottom). The total number of nuclei per field was determined by
manual counting using event flagging in Metamorph. Nuclei partly outside
the field of view were excluded.
[18F]FLT-PET imaging. Animals with subcutaneous H-69 xenografts in
the neck were used when the tumors reached ∼150 mm3. The tumor-bearing mice were given vehicle or PD173074 once daily by oral gavage and
imaged with [18F]FLT-PET on days 0, 7, and 14 of treatment. Dynamic
[18F]FLT-PET studies were carried out on a dedicated small animal PET
scanner, quad-HIDAC (Oxford Positron Systems; ref. 15). Scanning was performed as previously described (16). [18F]FLT (80–100 μCi; 2.96–3.7 MBq)
was injected into the tail veins of anesthetized mice positioned prone within the scanner. Dynamic scans were acquired in list-mode format over a
60-min period and sorted into 0.5-mm sinogram bins and 19 time frames
(0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm voxels; 4 × 15 s, 4 × 60 s, and 11 × 300 s) for image
reconstruction. Cumulative images comprising of 30 to 60 min of the
dynamic data were used for visualization of radiotracer uptake and to draw
regions of interest. Regions of interest were defined on five tumor and five
heart slices (each was 0.5 mm thick). Dynamic data from these slices were
averaged for each tissue and at each of the 19 time points to obtain time
versus radioactivity curves for these tissues. Tumor radioactivity was corrected for physical decay and normalized to that of heart to obtain a standardized uptake value. The fractional retention of tracer was calculated as
the normalized uptake in tumors 60 min relative to that at 1.5 min (16).
Fluorescent in situ hybridization. Paraffin-embedded sections were
dewaxed for 10 min in xylene then treated with 100% methanol for
5 min. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide
in methanol for 10 min. Sections were taken through graded alcohols to
PBS, permeabilized with 1M sodium thiocyanate for 10 min at 80°C, washed
twice in PBS for 5 min before digestion with 0.4% pepsin in 0.1M HCL for
10 min at 37°C. Sections were then quenched in 0.2% glycine in two-time
PBS for 5 min at room temperature and rinsed in PBS. Postfixation was
performed using 4% PFA for 2 min then washed in PBS. Sections were
dehydrated through graded alcohols to absolute and air dried. Probe mix
(10 μL) were applied to each section then coverslipped and sealed with
lubber cement. The sections were denatured at 80°C for 10 min before
hydridizing overnight at 37°C in a sealed humid chamber. The rubber

cement and coverslips were then removed and the slides immersed in
0.5× SSC for 5 min at 37°C. The slides were then washed 5× in PBS at room
temperature for 10 min then mounted in Vectashield (Invitrogen) with 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) before examination with a fluorescent
microscope.
Reagents. Etoposide was from Sigma-Aldrich. The inhibitor PD173074
was from Park Davies. Antibodies for FGFR2 and endomucin were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Active caspase 3 antibody was from R&D Systems and the cytokeratin 18 antibody was from Dako. The FGFR1 antibody
was a kind gift from Dr. Caroline Johnston. 32Pγ-ATP and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham-Pharmacia. Human recombinant FGF-2 and cisplatin were from Calbiochem.

Results
Addition of PD173074 inhibits FGF-2–mediated growth,
proliferation, and chemoresistance of H510 cells. We first verified that FGFR1 and FGFR2 are expressed in SCLC cells. Equal
protein amounts from eight SCLC cell lines were probed for the
presence of these two high-affinity FGF-2 receptors. Both were

expressed in all lines although to a varying extent (Fig. 1A). Activation of FGFR tyrosine kinases can be assessed by their transphosphorylation upon ligand binding. In vitro transphosphorylation
assays showed that addition of FGF-2 to H510 cells increased both
FGFR1 and FGFR2 kinase activity (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that
these receptors are functional. Indeed, this resulted in an increase
in clonogenic growth and liquid culture cell proliferation that was
blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the FGFR inhibitor
PD173074 (Fig. 2A and B). This correlated with the ability of the
compound to impair FGF-2–induced receptor transphosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained in H69 cells (data
not shown; Fig. 4A). Inhibition of FGF-2–mediated proliferation
was also observed in three additional SCLC cell lines, SW2, H209,
and H2171 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We have previously shown that FGF-2 induces chemoresistance
in a MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)/Erk–dependent fashion in SCLC cells
(6). Therefore, we next investigated whether the compound could
impair this effect. Figure 2C shows that addition of 10 nmol/L
PD173074 blocked FGF-2–triggered resistance to etoposide killing

NOTE: The inhibitory potential of PD173074 (0.1 and 1 μmol/L) was
tested in an in vitro kinase assay using a panel of tyrosine and serine/
threonine kinases as previously published (21). Results are expressed
as a percentage of initial activity ± SEM.

of H510 cells. This correlated with inhibition of MEK/Erk signaling
(data not shown). Altogether, our results show that PD173074 successfully inhibits the biological effects of FGF-2 on H510 and H69
cells.
PD173074 is a selective inhibitor of FGFR. Previous work has
shown that PD173074 is specific to FGFR, with a 30-fold higher IC50
against the related kinase domain of vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (13). However, only five other kinases were examined. Here, we have tested the inhibitory effect of this molecule
against a panel of 78 kinases at two concentrations (0.1 and
1 μmol/L). This confirmed that FGFR1 was by far the most efficiently inhibited kinase examined (Table 1). The only other kinase
to show significant impairment of activity was LCK. However, a
dose response study (Supplementary Fig. S2) showed that the
IC50 for this kinase was ∼15 fold greater than that previously
reported for FGFR1 (13).
Oral administration of PD173074 inhibits H510 and H69
tumor growth and potentiates cisplatin effects in nude mice.
H510 cells in Matrigel were injected into the flank of nude mice,
and once tumors were measurable, animals were randomized
to receive carrier buffer in the absence or presence of PD173074
(50 mg/kg) by oral gavage daily for 28 days with or without cisplatin (5 mg/kg) i.v. on days 1 and 10. Figure 3A shows that
PD173074 as a single agent was as efficient as cisplatin at prolonging survival of tumor-bearing animals compared with control
treatment. However, combined cisplatin and PD173074 exerted
an additional survival benefit. This correlated with each agent
independently, reducing tumor growth compared with control

treatment (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the combination of cisplatin and
PD173074 was significantly better at impairing growth compared
with either agent alone (Fig. 3B).
As PD173074 reduced but did not completely eliminate H510
primary tumors, we wondered whether it could nevertheless inhibit tumor dissemination. Following 28 days of PD173074 or buffer
treatment, the lymph nodes proximal to each xenograft were
extracted and processed by fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) for murine and human centromeres. Although murine
pan-centromeric probes allowed visualization of the mouse lymph
node tissue, the appearance of human pan-centromeric staining
was used to identify and count invading human H510 cells
(Fig. 3C, left). Our results show that PD173074 did not block tumor
cell metastasis (Fig. 3C, right). Because FGF-2 is known to mediate
neoangiogenesis, we next examined whether the inhibitor might
disrupt this process in the xenografts. This was assessed by imaging blood vessels in tumor sections after endomucin staining
(Fig. 3D, left top) and subsequent Image J analysis of the vascular
area (Fig. 3D, left bottom). Our data revealed that FGFR inhibitor
treatment had no effect on tumor neoangiogenesis (Fig. 3D, right).
In contrast, animals treated with cisplatin, used here as a positive
control (17), showed a marked decrease in the vascular area. Finally, coadministration of PD173074 did not enhance disruption of the
vasculature by cisplatin. This suggests that the increased efficacy
of coadministered cisplatin and PD173074 in H510 xenografts is
not due to vascular targeting.
To establish whether the inhibitory effect of this compound was
applicable to other SCLC xenografts, we next examined its effects
on H69 cells. In agreement with our earlier observations, PD173074
significantly blocked the growth of these cells in vitro (Fig. 4A). Administration of the compound to mice bearing H-69 xenografts significantly impaired tumor growth compared with control
(Supplementary Table; Fig. 4B). This resulted in complete remission and long-term survival beyond 6 months in 50% of the treated
animals, whereas all controls had to be sacrificed within 2 months
(Fig. 4C). Indeed, the surviving animals were subsequently sacrificed 1 year later and extensive histology was negative for disease
(data not shown).
[18F]FLT-PET is an early predictor of response to PD173074
in vivo. To determine if we could predict response to PD173074

clinic, we next used [18F]FLT-PET to monitor intratumoral proliferation. Animals bearing subcutaneous H69 xenografts in the neck
were given diluent with or without PD173074 by oral gavage daily
and injected with [ 18 F]FLT-PET before imaging at day 8 and
14. Figure 5A shows representative [18F]FLT-PET imaging from
one control and one PD173074-treated animal before and 14 days
into administration of the treatment. Analysis of [18F]FLT-PET results by the fractional retention time, a parameter independent of
tumor size, and less dependent on perfusion, showed that
PD173074 administration reduced cellular proliferation (Fig. 5B).
In the same tumors, growth inhibition was shown by calliper measurements (Fig. 5A, bottom). This suggests that [18F]FLT-PET might
provide a noninvasive way to predict early tumor response in
patients treated with an agent like PD173074.
PD173074 induces intratumoral apoptosis. Since a significant
proportion of treated tumors disappeared (Fig. 4C), we wondered
whether administration of PD173074 might also induce apoptosis
in the H69 SCLC xenografts. Figure 5C (top) shows immunohistochemical staining of representative tumor tissue sections from a
control and PD173074-treated animal at day 14. PD173074 increased caspase 3 activation and cleavage of one of its well-known
substrates, cytokeratin 18 (Fig. 5C). The effects seen were statistically significant across all 10 control and treated tumors (Fig. 5C,
bottom; P ≤ 0.005 and P ≤ 0.0004 for caspase-3 and cytokeratin-18,
respectively). The increased cell death may be linked to inhibition
of FGFR1 rather than FGFR2 because Smartpool siRNA targeting
FGFR1 but not FGFR2 increased the proportion of H-69 cells in
sub-G1 as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5D, left). Both FGFR1
and 2 levels were similarly downregulated by the respective RNAi
treatment in H69 cells, excluding the possibility that differences in
targeting efficiency were responsible for this differential response
(Fig. 5D, right). Moreover, our results were validated by repeating
the experiments with deconvoluted single targeting sequences
(data not shown). Concomitant silencing of both FGFR1 and
FGFR2 did not decrease cell viability beyond FGFR1 downregulation alone (Fig. 5D, left). Taken together, these results suggest that
the FGFR inhibitor induces apoptosis in H-69 cells and that monitoring of apoptotic markers in patients might be another way to
assess response.

FGFR Inhibitor Blocks Small Cell Lung Cancer Growth In vivo

Discussion
The development of novel therapies for SCLC is urgently required. Our previous work has suggested that targeting FGFR
might be useful as FGF-2 induces both proliferative and prosurvival signaling in this tumor type (6, 7). Here, we have examined the
in vitro and in vivo effects of the selective FGFR inhibitor PD173074
on SCLC tumor growth and response to chemotherapy.
Our results show that PD173074 impairs the growth of two SCLC
cells lines both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in one model, it led
to full tumor regression and disease-free long-term survival in 50%
of animals bearing this xenograft. These effects on tumor growth
could be explained by a decrease in intratumoral proliferation, as
shown by [18F]FLT-PET, and an increase in apoptotic cell death, as
shown by the appearance of two well-characterize d apoptotic
markers. FGF signaling has been involved in angiogenesis, and inhibiting FGFRs could be expected to lead to neoangiogenesis defects (14). However, macroscopic changes to the tumor vasculature
could not be detected, suggesting that changes in blood supply was
unlikely to be involved in the tumor regression. Also, FGF signaling
has been shown to regulate cell motility in a variety of cellular contexts (18). Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that
PD173074 treatment would impair tumor dissemination to distant
sites in our in vivo models. Surprisingly, however, no statistically
significant changes to lymph nodes metastasis was detected in animals treated with the drug compared with those treated with solvent alone.
Taken together, these data suggest that FGFR inhibition could
provide a powerful therapeutic strategy for SCLC treatment in clinical settings. Our previous results highlighted protein kinases in-

volved in the growth promoting effects of FGF-2 in SCLC. These
included MEK, B-Raf, PKCε, and S6 Kinase 2 (9). Except for S6
Kinase 2, compounds targeting these molecules exist, but their
use in vivo has been disappointing owing mainly to the general
toxicity of target inhibition (19, 20). The drug used here is orally
available and no sign of toxicity was observed in treated animals
following 28 daily administrations of the compound. Our animal
imaging data using [18F]FLT-PET show that changes to tumor
biology can be detected early following PD173074 treatment. This
approach could be used in the clinic to determine early responsiveness to the drug. Similarly, the cytokeratin 18 cleavage that
increased in response to PD173074 in the present study could
potentially be used in patient serum samples to follow antitumoral
effects.
In short, our results suggest that FGFR inhibition, while improving response to classic therapeutic regimen, could be efficient as a
monotherapy for a subset of lung cancer patients.
