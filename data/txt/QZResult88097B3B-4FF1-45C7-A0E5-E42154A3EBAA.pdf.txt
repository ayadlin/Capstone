BACKGROUND: Amplification of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) gene can promote tumor resistance to epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition. Dual EGFR-MET inhibition may overcome this resistance. Tivantinib (ARQ 197) is a selective,
oral, non–ATP-competitive, small-molecule inhibitor of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase. This phase 1 trial assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of tivantinib combined with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. METHODS: Patients with
advanced solid malignancies were administered oral tivantinib at escalating doses of 120, 240, 360, and 480 mg twice daily (BID)
plus 150 mg erlotinib once daily (QD). Single or multiple intrapatient dose escalation was planned in the absence of dose-limiting
toxicity in the first cycle of therapy (21 days). RESULTS: Thirty-two patients received combination treatment. Tivantinib serum
concentrations were not dose-proportional. The most common (20%) adverse events (AEs) regardless of causality included rash (n
¼ 17), fatigue (n ¼ 12), nausea (n ¼ 10), abdominal pain (n ¼ 10), diarrhea (n ¼ 9), bradycardia (n ¼ 9), and anemia (n ¼ 7). AEs considered related to study treatment occurred in 28 patients (87.5%), and 5 patients (15.6%) had treatment-related serious AEs, including neutropenia, leukopenia, syncope, sinus bradycardia, and sick sinus syndrome. Fifteen of 32 patients (46.8%) had a partial
response (n ¼ 1) or stable disease (n ¼ 14) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Six of 8 patients with
nonsmall cell lung cancer achieved stable disease. The recommended phase 2 dose is tivantinib 360 mg BID plus erlotinib 150 mg
QD. CONCLUSIONS: Tivantinib plus erlotinib was well tolerated with encouraging clinical activity, especially in patients with nonsmall

Cancer therapy directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway has improved outcomes for
patients with cancers of the lung, colon, pancreas, and head and neck.1,2 A low objective response rate to erlotinib for
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (8.9% in an unselected cohort) was demonstrated in the pivotal BR.21
trial.1 Concurrently, the pathophysiology underlying response to EGFR inhibition was elucidated in several studies, demonstrating that the presence of somatic mutations, primarily in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene, led to enhanced tyrosine kinase activity and increased sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib.3,4
Evidence of clinical benefit to TKIs in patients with wild-type, amplified EGFR has also been reported.5 However, the duration of even the most dramatic responses observed in these studies was often short (eg, median duration of response was
7.9 months in the BR.21 study), and ultimately all patients developed resistance.
The efficacy of EGFR TKI therapy is undermined by both primary and secondary resistance mechanisms. Primary
resistance to EGFR TKI therapy has been identified in patients with mutated KRAS (v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog).6 In addition, mechanisms of acquired resistance (ie, secondary resistance) to EGFR TKI therapy
have also been elucidated. A secondary mutation in exon 20 of EGFR, a substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M), has been identified in approximately half of the patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.7,8
More recently, 2 other second-site EGFR mutations have been demonstrated to confer resistance to EGFR TKIs: a T854A
substitution in exon 21 and a D761Y substitution in exon 19.8,9

EGFR TKI resistance can also be mediated through
parallel activation of downstream signal transducers.
Amplification of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition
factor (MET) gene has been associated with activation of
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, a
pathway that is also activated during EGFR-mediated signaling. Indeed MET gene amplification has been associated with tumor resistance to EGFR TKI therapy in both
in vitro and in vivo studies.9,10 In support of this, MET
amplification has been detected as a secondary event in
approximately 22% of patients with EGFR-mutated
NSCLC that have acquired erlotinib or gefitinib resistance.9,10 Mechanistically, MET amplification may contribute to EGFR TKI resistance through increased MET
heterodimerization with human EGFR-related protein 3
(HER3) and activation of the PI3K/Akt cell survival pathway (Figure 1).10 Consistent with this, EGFR inhibition
can also be overcome by exposure to the MET ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in preclinical models.11
Given the interplay of the EGFR and MET signaling pathways, preclinical studies have evaluated the possible synergistic benefit of dual inhibitory strategies.10,12 In
lung cancer cell lines that developed resistance to gefitinib
because of MET amplification, treatment with a MET inhibitor restored sensitivity to gefitinib.10 Likewise, treatment of erlotinib-resistant H1975 cells harboring the
EGFR T790M mutation with a small-molecule MET inhibitor plus erlotinib enhanced inhibition of EGFR
downstream signaling pathways and promoted tumor
regression in the H1975 xenograft model.12 Furthermore,
tivantinib (ARQ 197), a selective MET inhibitor, demonstrated synergistic activity when combined with erlotinib
in xenograft studies with the NCI-H441 cell line (unpublished results from ArQule, Inc., Woburn, Massachusetts,
and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). These
studies demonstrated that dual inhibition can overcome
EGFR TKI resistance, whether due to the EGFR T790M
mutation or MET amplification.
Tivantinib is a selective, oral, non–ATP-competitive
small-molecule inhibitor of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 355
nmol/L in biochemical assays, and an IC50 of 300 nmol/L
in studies of the MET-amplified human lung carcinoma
cell line NCI-H441.13 In 2 phase 1 dose-escalation studies
that evaluated the safety of orally administered tivantinib
monotherapy, the recommended phase 2 dose was established as 360 mg twice daily (BID), and a tolerable toxicity profile was observed, with the most common adverse
events (AEs) comprising fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders
(nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), and anemia.14,15
5904

On the basis of the strong molecular rationale and
preclinical data, dual EGFR-MET inhibition has been
proposed as a strategy for overcoming primary and secondary resistance to EGFR inhibition in the clinical setting. As such, patients were enrolled in a dose-escalation
trial to define the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
(PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of tivantinib in
combination with erlotinib.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligible patients were 18 years of age and had a pathologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that was
advanced, inoperable, or metastatic. Patients were
required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 to 1; adequate marrow, renal, and
hepatic function; absence of pregnancy; absence of a gastrointestinal disorder that could interfere with oral
absorption of the study medications; and no coexisting
severe medical conditions. Patients were required to have
measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Anticancer therapy
including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents had to be completed at
least 4 weeks prior to the first treatment received in this
trial, with the exception that patients previously taking
erlotinib monotherapy could be started on the trial without a treatment break. Central nervous system metastases
had to be treated, stable for 3 months, and asymptomatic
before enrollment. The study was approved by a local
institutional review board and in accordance with an
assurance filed with and approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration. Patients gave written informed
consent according to federal and institutional guidelines
before any study procedures were performed.
Drug Administration and Trial Design

Both tivantinib and erlotinib were administered orally 1
hour before or 2 hours after a meal in an open-label fashion on a continuous basis in cycles of 21 days. Erlotinib
was administered at 150 mg once daily (QD), and tivantinib was administered at escalating doses in 3 sequential
cohorts at 120, 240, and 360 mg BID. Single or multiple
intrapatient dose escalation at 120 mg BID increments
was planned in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT), defined as grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 or 4
thrombocytopenia with bleeding, or any other toxicity of
grade 3 or higher possibly or probably related to tivantinib
in the first cycle of therapy, including diarrhea, nausea,
and vomiting that could not be controlled by optimal
medical management. This study design was employed to

the first 21 days of treatment. Once the MTD was determined, an additional 6 to 15 patients could be treated at
that dose. Patients received erlotinib and tivantinib combination therapy until disease progression (clinical or

Pretreatment and Follow-Up Studies

The pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical
history; physical examination; a complete blood count
with white cell differential; blood chemistry analysis; liver
function tests; urinalysis; serum pregnancy test, if applicable; serum tumor markers, if applicable; and a blood sample for cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genotyping.
Radiographic assessments by computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging were performed at baseline
(<4 weeks before the first dose) and at 8-week intervals
throughout the study. Blood samples for complete blood
count with white cell differential, chemistry, and liver
function tests were collected on day 1 and day 15 of each
cycle. An electrocardiogram was performed before treatment and repeated on day 1 of therapy at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
10, 12, and 24 hours. Objective tumor response was evaluated by RECIST 1.0. Adverse events were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0
and were assessed throughout the study.
When available, tumor specimens from lung cancer
patients were assessed for mutations in EGFR and KRAS
by polymerase chain reaction testing for the most common mutations (performed by Clarient, Aliso Viejo,
Calif, and Response Genetics, Los Angeles, Calif). These
specimens were also tested for MET and EGFR amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization with gene-specific
probes and a centromere 7-specific probe (performed by
Caris MPI, Phoenix, Ariz).
Pharmacokinetic Assessment

Blood samples were collected on days 1 and 15 (before
dosing and 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 24 hours following
tivantinib and erlotinib concurrent administration) of
cycle 1. If intrapatient dose escalation occurred, repeat PK
samples were obtained on day 15 of that cycle. Pharmacokinetics parameters were analyzed by noncompartmental
methods using the WinNonLin 4.0 program (Pharsight,
St. Louis, Mo).
RESULTS
Patients

The study enrolled 32 patients with a mean age of 60 years
(range, 24-86 years) (Table 1). The most common tumor
types were NSCLC (8 patients [25%]), and colorectal,
kidney, and head and neck tumors (3 patients each [9.4%
each]). Patients had received a median of 3 (range, 0-8)

360 mg BID, respectively, in combination with erlotinib
150 mg QD.
Safety

The most common treatment-emergent AEs, regardless of
causality, included rash, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, bradycardia, and anemia; these were mostly
grade 1 or 2 in severity (Table 2). Hematologic toxicities
included grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 3 patients, grade 4
leukopenia in 1 patient, grade 2 and 3 thrombocytopenia
in 2 patients, and grade 1 or 2 anemia in 7 patients. Six
deaths occurred during study treatment due to disease
progression; none were attributed to the study drugs.
A total of 28 patients (87.5%) reported AEs considered definitely, possibly, or probably related to study drug
by the investigator. Treatment-related serious AEs were
reported in 5 patients, including 1 patient in cohort 1
with grade 3 sinus bradycardia, 1 patient in cohort 2 with
grade 3 sick sinus syndrome, and 3 patients in cohort 3
with grade 4 neutropenia (2 events), grade 4 leukopenia,
and grade 3 syncope associated with dehydration. The
grade 3 sinus bradycardia and sick sinus syndrome
occurred on day 36 and day 812 of treatment, respectively, and both events resolved, although the grade 3
sinus bradycardia resolved with sequelae (patient did not
require a pacemaker but was concurrently found to have
hypothyroidism and was treated with levothyroxine).

BID. Dose reductions occurred in 1 patient in cycle 1
(from 480 mg to 360 mg BID) and 1 patient in cycle 5

tion. Two patients with head and neck cancer had disease
control for 7 and 8 months, respectively, and 1 of these
patients had a PR. Among the 8 patients with NSCLC enrolled in this study, 6 of whom had received prior erlotinib monotherapy, 6 had SD for 3 to 23 months, 1 had
progressive disease, and 1 discontinued early due to an
unrelated AE and received no posttreatment tumor assessments. Median progression-free survival (PFS) among all
32 patients was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval,
2.0-8.1 months).

tivantinib increased in a manner that was less than proportional to dose. There was no accumulation of tivantinib or
erlotinib with successive treatment cycles. Although this
study was not designed to test for drug–drug interactions,
there did not appear to be a significant interaction
between tivantinib and erlotinib in this study.
CYP2C19 genotype data were obtained for 31 of 32
patients (97%). Most patients had an extensive (n ¼ 19) or
intermediate (n ¼ 11) metabolizer genotype, and only 1
patient had a poor metabolizer genotype. Because of the
low number of poor metabolizers, rigorous PK comparisons
between CYP2C19 genotypes could not be performed.
Antitumor Activity

Twenty-two patients had at least 1 posttreatment tumor
response assessment, and 15 of 32 patients (46.8%) had
either stable disease (SD; n ¼ 14) or partial response (PR,
n ¼ 1) by RECIST (Table 4). One patient with a chordoma involving the lumbosacral spine had SD for more
than 30 months and continues to receive treatment with
tivantinib 360 mg BID at the time of manuscript prepara5908

Specimens were available for exploratory biomarker analysis from 6 of 8 patients with NSCLC (Table 5). One of 5
patients tested was positive for an EGFR mutation, and 3
of 6 patients tested were positive for MET amplification.
Further analysis revealed that increased MET gene copy
number (GCN), ranging from 3 to 4.5 copies per cell, was
associated with a concomitant increase in chromosome 7
centromeres consistent with high polysomy rather than
gene amplification. Patients with increased MET GCN
remained on study for a mean of 14.7 months (range, 6.623.3 months) compared with 8.6 months (range, 1.915.8 months) for patients with normal MET GCN. One
patient with a KRAS mutation, wild-type EGFR, and
MET amplification remained on study for 14.3 months.
DISCUSSION
Continuous therapy with the combination of erlotinib
and tivantinib was well tolerated. The occurrence of rash
and diarrhea was consistent with previous reports of erlotinib monotherapy.1 Two patients experienced serious
AEs potentially related to arrhythmia (sinus bradycardia
and sick sinus syndrome) that were considered by the investigator as possibly related to treatment; however, there
was no consistency in the timing of these events (day 36
and day 812 of treatment, respectively). Although no formal MTD was identified, a regimen of erlotinib 150 mg
QD plus tivantinib 360 mg BID demonstrated a favorable
safety profile and preliminary clinical activity and was
considered the recommended phase 2 dose. Activity was
primarily evidenced by prolonged disease stabilization for
at least 2 months in 13 patients (41%) and for more than
6 months (range, 6.5-29.5 months) in 8 patients (25%).
The best responses were observed in patients with
NSCLC (5 patients [15.6%]), and chordoma, ovarian
cancer, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, and squamous cell
carcinoma of the skin (1 patient each [3.1% each]).

has been implicated in oncogenesis.16 It is expressed physiologically in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, thyroid, kidney, and brain, and its only known ligand is scatter factor,
otherwise known as HGF. Activation of MET leads to its
binding to and phosphorylation of adaptor proteins such
as Gab-1, Grb-2, Shc, and c-Cbl, with subsequent activation of proliferative cascades, including the Ras, PI3K/
Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription, and
beta-catenin/Wnt pathways.17 Overexpression of MET
frequently occurs in carcinomas and, to a lesser extent, in

lymphoma and leukemia. In addition, MET overexpression has been associated with the neoplastic phenotype,
including dysfunctional cell survival, growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.18-23 Furthermore, MET
expression has also been demonstrated to characterize selfrenewing cancer stem cells.24
MET activation may play a prominent role in the
etiology of NSCLC, because MET axis activation, demonstrated by MET phosphorylation, is present in more
than 70% of NSCLC tissue specimens.21 Furthermore, 2

retrospective studies demonstrated that an increased
GCN of MET (ie, MET amplification) leading to high
MET activity was associated with a poor prognosis in
patients with NSCLC following surgical resection and in
patients with advanced NSCLC.25,26 Increased MET
GCN is also highly associated with EGFR amplification
but has not been observed de novo in EGFR mutant
tumors.25,26
MET amplification may arise from either specific
MET gene duplication or through more global chromosome aberrations. True MET gene amplification has been
reported in 3.9% to 4.1% of NSCLC specimens, whereas
an increase in MET GCN due to high polysomy has been
reported in 11.1% to 12.8% of cases.21,22 Amplification
of MET was not associated with sex, histology, smoking
status, or cancer stage in the analysis by Go et al, whereas
Cappuzzo et al found an association with advanced cancer
stage.25,26 However, the actual incidence of increased
MET GCN is unclear, because results from other series
have reported rates of MET amplification ranging from
7.3% to 21% of surgical specimens.27,28 The large variation for the reported incidence of MET amplification may
arise from differences in the assays. Furthermore, MET
amplification may be underestimated, because de novo
MET-amplified subclones may be present in many lung
cancers, but not at a frequency high enough for detection
until the proper treatment-associated selective pressures
are applied.29
On the basis of the aforementioned scientific rationale for this combination of tivantinib and erlotinib, there
was particular interest in its use for patients with NSCLC
in this study. A cohort of 8 NSCLC patients remained on
therapy for a mean of 36.9 weeks (range, 1.9-93 weeks).
By way of cross-trial comparison, given all the limitations
of such an analysis, the median PFS in the BR.21 study
was 9.7 weeks.1 In the current trial, 4 of the 5 patients
tested for EGFR status were wild type (the EGFR mutation status for 3 patients was unknown), and, therefore,
would generally not be predicted to have such prolonged
benefit from single-agent EGFR inhibition. A further
review of biomarker data suggested that patients with
MET amplification may be more likely to benefit from
combination EGFR and MET blockade, and that KRAS
mutations may not confer primary resistance to combination treatment.
In the present study, 5 of 6 NSCLC patients previously exposed to erlotinib monotherapy achieved SD
when treated with erlotinib and tivantinib combination
therapy. The safety and efficacy of erlotinib and tivantinib
combination therapy have been further evaluated in a
5910

randomized phase 2 trial comparing erlotinib 150 mg
QD plus tivantinib 360 mg BID with erlotinib plus placebo in previously treated patients with advanced
NSCLC.30 In this study, PFS in the intent-to-treat population adjusted for sex, previous chemotherapy, best previous response, and EGFR mutation status was improved in
the erlotinib plus tivantinib group (hazard ratio ¼ 0.68;
95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.98; P < .05) whereas
overall survival in the intent-to-treat population was not
significantly different between treatment groups. A preplanned exploratory analysis in patients with nonsquamous histology showed a trend toward improved PFS and
overall survival.30 Based on these results, a phase 3 trial
comparing erlotinib plus tivantinib to erlotinib plus placebo in previously treated, EGFR-inhibitor–naive
patients with nonsquamous histology NSCLC was initiated and is currently enrolling patients.31
The results of this phase 1 dose-escalation study
demonstrate that tivantinib can be combined safely with
erlotinib. Moreover, the combination of tivantinib plus
erlotinib demonstrated activity in patients who had progressed on erlotinib monotherapy. This study serves as a
proof-of-concept that inhibition of multiple pathways
through combination therapy provides clinical benefit and
offers promise as a strategy to overcome drug resistance.
