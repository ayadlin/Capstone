Abstract
Thiopurines are effective immunosuppressants and anticancer agents, but intracellular accumulation of their active
metabolites (6-thioguanine nucleotides, 6-TGN) causes doselimiting hematopoietic toxicity. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase
deficiency is known to exacerbate thiopurine toxicity. However, many patients are highly sensitive to thiopurines for
unknown reasons. We show that multidrug-resistance protein
4 (Mrp4) is abundant in myeloid progenitors and tested the
role of the Mrp4, an ATP transporter of monophosphorylated
nucleosides, in this unexplained thiopurine sensitivity. Mrp4deficient mice experienced Mrp4 gene dosage-dependent
toxicity caused by accumulation of 6-TGNs in their myelopoietic
cells. Therefore, Mrp4 protects against thiopurine-induced
hematopoietic toxicity by actively exporting thiopurine nucleotides. We then identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in human MRP4 (rs3765534) that dramatically reduces
MRP4 function by impairing its cell membrane localization.
This SNP is common (>18%) in the Japanese population and
indicates that the increased sensitivity of some Japanese
patients to thiopurines may reflect the greater frequency of
this MRP4 SNP. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):4983–9]

Introduction
Thiopurines [azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), and thioguanine] are effective immunosuppressants and anticancer agents
(1) but cause acute gastrointestinal and hematopoietic toxicity. The
intracellular accumulation of their active metabolites, 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) is associated with hematologic toxicity.
This toxicity is exacerbated in patients who carry at least one
thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT)–defective allele (1, 2). For
largely unknown reasons, a subset of other patients who have not
inherited TPMT deficiency also experience severe thiopurineinduced myelosuppression (2–4). Factors known to affect intracellular thiopurine concentration do not seem to be implicated in
these cases (2, 3). We and others have shown in cell line models

that overexpression of multidrug-resistance protein 4 (MRP4)
enhances egress of monophosphorylated forms of nucleoside drugs
(5–7). However, it is unknown if MRP4 is expressed in thiopurinesensitive hematopoietic cells and if it protects these cells by
limiting their accumulation of 6-TGN.
The MRP (ABCC) gene family is highly polymorphic, and MRP4 is
among the most polymorphic (8); over 20 missense genetic variants
have been identified in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information database7 and the Pharmacogenetics Research
Network.8 Because patients who are not TPMT-deficient experience
severe thiopurine-induced myelosuppression, including many
Japanese patients (3), we hypothesized that MRP4 may provide
an explanation for this unexplained thiopurine sensitivity. Our
studies determined that one MRP4 missense mutation is prevalent
in Japanese (>18%) and that this allele is functionally impaired.
Collectively, our studies show that absence of Mrp4 in a murine
model causes thiopurine hematopoietic toxicity and our in vitro
studies suggest that some variant human MRP4s could be a locus
accounting for enhanced thiopurine sensitivity among susceptible
populations.

Mrp4 against Thiopurine-Induced Hematopoietic Toxicity
MRP4 gene expression. Microarray data was extracted from a previous
publication (15). Bone marrow cells were collected 20 h after the start of
6-MP therapy from eight patients as described (13) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and total RNA was processed and hybridized to the
HG-U133A GeneChip oligonucleotide microarray (Affymetrix, Inc.; see
manufacturer’s manual for detailed protocol). Default settings of Microarray
Suite software version 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc.) were used to calculate scaled

gene expression values, which are highly correlated with real-time PCR
values. The probe set for MRP4 was 203196_at.

Results and Discussion
Bone marrow cells of Mrp4 wild-type mice were isolated, and
RNA was prepared from different lineages as described (see

Supplementary Fig. S1A). After glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gadph) normalization, Mrp4 RNA was highly expressed
in monocyte/macrophage and erythroid progenitors (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S1A), which are disproportionately affected by
thiopurine toxicity (16), whereas another ABC transporter, Mrp1,
was expressed in all cell lineages.
The 6-MP sensitivity of Mrp4 +/+ and Mrp4 / mice was tested
by i.p. injections with 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg of 6-MP daily for
15 days, and survival was monitored. All Mrp4 / mice died by
day 13 regardless of 6-MP dose (Fig. 1B, left), whereas >75% of
the wild-type mice survived at day 15 (P = 0.001, log-rank test),
including most of those that received 150 mg/kg 6-MP (Fig. 1B,
middle). Neither age nor sex was associated with 6-MP sensitivity.
The number of Mrp4 alleles (gene dosage effect) affected 6-MP
toxicity. The Mrp4+/ mice show that a single Mrp4 allele was
protective because the duration of survival was greater than mice
lacking Mrp4 (Fig. 1B, right). The enhanced 6-MP sensitivity could
not be explained by increased expression of the purine nucleoside
uptake transporters Slc28a3, Slc29a2 (17) or reduced expression of
Mrp5 (which is capable of 6-MP nucleotide efflux; refs. 12, 18;
Fig. 1C), because the expression levels of these genes (P > 0.05) in
Mrp4 / versus Mrp4+/+ bone marrow was no different. Although
Slc29a1 transports mercaptopurine ribosides (18), we could not
detect it in bone marrow cells. TPMT activity (responsible for
methylation of 6-MP) and expression of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt; the major enzyme bioactivating 6-MP)
were also comparable in Mrp4 / and Mrp4+/+ bone marrow cells
(Fig. 1D).
Yeast ABCC family members affect transport of purine
biosynthetic intermediates (19). Therefore, we assessed if Mrp4
absence affected the mean rate of de novo purine biosynthesis in
bone marrow cells. Among Mrp4+/+, Mrp4+/ , and Mrp4 /
genotypes the rate of synthesis was 3.1 F 1.4, 3.0 F 1.0, and
4.0 F 1.0 pmol of newly synthesized purine/nmol unlabeled
purine/h, respectively, which indicates Mrp4 absence did not
enhance 6-MP sensitivity by reducing de novo purine biosynthesis.
To determine the physical basis of the 6-MP toxicity (16)
observed in vivo, we evaluated Mrp4+/+ and Mrp4 / mice after five
daily doses (6-MP toxicity typically occurs at day 10 in Mrp4 /
mice) of 100 mg/kg 6-MP (Fig. 2). Although Mrp4 is expressed in
the gastrointestinal tract, weight loss on day 6 was nearly identical
in 6-MP–treated Mrp4 / and Mrp4+/+ animals (Fig. 2A). However,
on day 6, bone marrow cellularity and cell number were dramatically reduced in 6-MP–treated Mrp4 / mice (Fig. 2B, left). The
reduction in nucleated hematopoietic cells was dependent upon
Mrp4 gene dosage as Mrp4 +/ bone marrow had more nucleated
cells compared with Mrp4 / (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In a
parallel experiment, we isolated bone marrow cells to immunophenotypically test progenitor cells for lineage-specific hematopoietic toxicity. After 5 days of 6-MP treatment (100 mg/kg daily), the
granulocyte (Gr-1) and monocyte-macrophage (Mac-1) progenitors
were reduced 71% and 74%, respectively, in Mrp4 / animals
compared with untreated controls but were reduced <20% in
Mrp4+/+ animals (Fig. 2B, right). 6-MP toxicity toward progenitor
cells (identified by c-kit positive cells) was almost identical and
consistent with suggestions that 6-MP is toxic to hematopoietic
progenitors (16). Equivalent toxicity between Mrp4 / and Mrp4+/+
progenitors might be expected because progenitor cells (CD34-KSL)
have low levels of Mrp4 (see Fig. 1A). To ensure that Mrp4 /
mice were not inherently more susceptible to hematopoietic
toxicity, we compared the effect of 25 and 50 mg/kg of etoposide

(not an Mrp4 substrate). The myelotoxic effects of etoposide
were indistinguishable in Mrp4 / and Mrp4+/+ mice (data not
shown).
Cytotoxicity of 6-MP toward erythroid progenitors was greater in
Mrp4 / mice as revealed by markedly fewer GATA-1–positive cells
in Mrp4 / than in Mrp4+/+ bone marrow (Fig. 2C, left). Moreover,
erythroid progenitor reduction in 6-MP–treated mice was paralleled by a 50% reduction in blood hemoglobin concentration
(Fig. 2C, right). These results are consistent with the anemia and
dramatically reduced erythrocytes observed in patients experiencing thiopurine toxicity (20). This shows that the 6-MP sensitivity of
erythroid progenitors (designated Terll9; see Fig. 1A) is related to
the absence of Mrp4 function.

Mrp4 against Thiopurine-Induced Hematopoietic Toxicity

Thiopurine bone marrow cytotoxicity is dependent on the
cellular concentration of 6-TGN (9, 10, 21). We measured
thiopurine nucleotide concentration in the bone marrow cells of
mice 22 hours after a single 100-mg/kg dose of 6-MP. Although
plasma 6-MP concentration did not differ significantly in Mrp4+/+
and Mrp4 / mice (Fig. 2D, left), Mrp4 / bone marrow cell 6-TGN
concentration (20.7 F 5.2 pmol/106 cells; n = 4) was 10 times that
observed in Mrp4 +/+ bone marrow cells (1.7 F 0.6 pmol/106 cells;
n = 4; Fig. 2D, right). Therefore, Mrp4 limits the bone marrow cell
accumulation of thiopurine nucleotides.

To directly test if Mrp4 / bone marrow cells were more
sensitive to thiopurines, we assayed the formation of myeloid and
erythroid colonies in methylcellulose culture from the bone
marrow cells of Mrp4 / and Mrp4 +/+ littermates (20) cultured
with and without 6-MP (Fig. 3A). Growth of either erythroid
colonies in the presence of erythropoietin or myeloid colonyforming units was unimpaired by the absence of Mrp4 (not shown).
However, addition of 6-MP to the Mrp4 / hematopoietic cultures
reduced both myeloid (Fig. 3A) and erythroid (not shown) colonies.
In contrast, colony formation from Mrp4 +/+ bone marrow was

wild-type (18972-2269G) or 2269A variant (18967, 18940) MRP4 alleles. Although protein expression was similar (left; 50 Ag loaded), surface biotinylation and
pull-down show there was more than five times less variant MRP4 (n = 3 separate experiments) than wild-type MRP4 (n = 3 separate experiments) on the cell surface

Products of each exon are color-coded. Unexpectedly, sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT ) analysis predicted that the E867K amino acid substitution encoded
by the SNP would not affect MRP4 function (middle). Right, six nonsynonymous SNPs in the coding region of MRP4 and their genotypes in the three lymphocyte
cell lines. Table shows the frequency of these SNPs in the Japanese population. B, expression of MRP4 and transferrin receptor in HEK293 cells expressing the
2269G or variant (2269A) MRP4 allele. Protein expression was similar (50 Ag loaded). However, there was substantially less variant MRP4 (n = 3) than wild-type
MRP4 (n = 3) in the cell membrane (300 Ag total protein; mean F SD, 14.6% F 0.8% versus 3.2% F 0.4%; P < 0.0021; left). HEK293 cells expressing the variant MRP4
allele (2269A) were more sensitive to 6-MP (EC50 = 9.7 Amol/L) than those expressing the wild-type allele (EC50 = 17.3 Amol/L, P < 0.05; right ). C, HEK293 cells
expressing the 2269G reference MRP4 allele were transfected with either empty plasmid ( ) or reference MRP4 (indicated by WT) or the variant allele (2269). After
labeling the surface with biotin and pull-down of membrane proteins, the Mrp4 protein was identified by reaction with an anti-MRP4 antibody. D, bone marrow leukemia
(ALL ) cells were collected 20 h after the start of 6-MP therapy (1.0 gm/m2 infused over 6 h), as previously described in detail (13) from eight patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. TGN nucleotide levels were determined, and MRP4 expression was determined by microarray analysis.

essentially unaffected by 6-MP (Fig. 3A). Mrp4 / hematopoietic
cells were not inherently more sensitive to cytotoxins as vincristine
(which is not an Mrp4 substrate) reduced myeloid progenitor
colony formation similarly in Mrp4 / and Mrp4 +/+ bone marrow
cells (Fig. 3B).
Mrp4 preferentially transports methylated 6-MP nucleotides,
therefore, to bypass the small reduction in TPMT activity (see
Fig. 1D), we compared myeloid colony formation from Mrp4 / and
and Mrp4+/+ bone marrow cells exposed to various concentrations
of 6-methyl mercaptopurine riboside (6-MMPr). The Mrp4 / cells
were three times as sensitive to 6-MMPr as Mrp4+/+ cells (IC50, 291
versus 917 Amol/L; P < 0.01, t test; Fig. 3C). To test if enhanced
thiopurine sensitivity is due to Mrp4 transport, we treated Mrp4 +/+
cells with the Mrp4 inhibitor MK571. Importantly, when Mrp4
function was blocked with MK571, 6-MMPr toxicity was equivalent
in Mrp4 +/+ and Mrp4 / myeloid progenitors. Therefore, loss of
Mrp4 function by chemical inhibition or genetic ablation sensitizes
myeloid progenitors to thiopurine toxicity.
The heightened 6-MP sensitivity of Japanese patients in the
absence of TPMT (2, 3) remains unexplained, and to our
knowledge, no clinical study has determined if a transporter is
responsible. We performed our own genetic and database screens
and identified a nonsynonymous MRP4 SNP (rs3765534; G2269A
nucleotide substitution E857K) that is widespread in the Japanese
population (a weighed average of all alleles indicates >18.7% allele
frequency) but much less frequent in other populations (see
Supplementary Table S1). To test the role of this SNP in MRP4
expression and function, we obtained HapMap lymphocyte cell
lines created from Japanese individuals homozygous for wild-type
or variant (rs3765534) MRP4 allele (Coriell Repository). These cell
lines were screened to have similar growth characteristics because
proliferation rate markedly affects thiopurine cell toxicity. An
immunoblot of a total cell lysate shows comparable MRP4
expression in these cell lines (Fig. 4A). In contrast, when we used
surface biotinylation to determine if the surface membrane levels
of MRP4 were comparable (labeled ‘‘pull-down’’), the two cell lines
homozygous for variant MRP4 showed markedly less MRP4
membrane localization (Fig. 4A, left). Importantly, this SNP is
located in the coding region for the fourth extracellular loop
(Fig. 4A, middle), which is intriguing because other transport
proteins with amino acid substitutions in extracellular loops have
impaired membrane localization (22).
We next tested whether the reduced plasma membrane localization of the variant MRP4 affected 6-MP cytotoxicity. Only one variant
cell line (NA18967) was tested; the other (NA18940) was excluded
because its growth rate was consistently slower than the other two
cell lines, preventing comparable measurement of 6-MP toxicity.
The 18967 cells (harboring the G2269A substitution) were much
more susceptible than the 18972 lymphocytes to 6-MP toxicity
(EC50, 28.8 Amol/L versus 99.5 Amol/L; P < 0.0002), and the cell lines
did not differ significantly in expression of the purine nucleoside
uptake transporters SLC28a3, SLC29a2, and the thiopurine nucleotide efflux transporter MRP5 (P > 0.05 see Supplementary Fig. S1C).
These findings reinforce the idea that enhanced thiopurine
sensitivity is linked to the reduced surface expression of MRP4.
However, analyzing the MRP4 haplotype of the Japanese HapMap
lymphocytes revealed five additional nonsynonymous SNPs other
than rs3765534 that, although less frequent, might affect MRP4
membrane targeting (Fig. 4A, right). Therefore, to investigate the
specific effect of the rs3765534 SNP (G2269A nucleotide substitution
alone), we engineered it into a reference MRP4 allele and expressed

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

it in HEK293 cell lines. Immunoblot analysis of total lysates revealed
comparable levels of expression of the reference allele and variant
MRP4 (Fig. 4B, left). However, surface biotinylation revealed a
5-fold reduction in cell surface expression of variant MRP4 allele
compared with the reference allele (Fig. 4B). The reduced plasma
membrane localization of the variant MRP4 was reflected by
enhanced 6-MP cytotoxicity: the EC50 was 9.7 Amol/L versus
17.3 Amol/L in cells expressing reference MRP4 allele (P < 0.05) and
8.6 Amol/L in cells containing empty vector (Fig. 4B, right). These
studies were extended to show that the cells expressing the variant
MRP4 allele were less able to exclude 6-MP metabolites compared
with the reference MRP4 allele (not shown).
Transporters can form higher order complexes (dimers and
multimers); therefore, we tested if the rs3765534 variant MRP4
impairs the coexpression or membrane localization of the reference
MRP4 allele. We transfected HEK293 cells stably expressing the
reference MRP4 allele with either the reference MRP4 allele or the
variant G2269A allele. The variant MRP4 allele had no effect on
the amount of MRP4 reference allele localized to the plasma
membrane (Fig. 4C). This result shows that coexpression of the
variant MRP4 allele does not directly impair the membrane
localization of the reference MRP4 allele and suggests that the
variant MRP4 allele is unlikely to have a dominant-negative role
and impair function of the MRP4 reference allele.
Extension of these studies showed less TGNs in human leukemic
lymphoblasts expressing a high level of MRP4 (Fig. 4D). This finding
is consistent with recent studies indicating leukemia cell lines
selected for 6-MP resistance overexpress MRP4 and accumulate less
6-MP and its metabolites (21). Thus, variation in the amount of
Mrp4 and function in leukemias may be an additional factor to
account for reduced therapeutic efficacy of thiopurines.
Our demonstration that MRP4 plays a strong role in protection
against 6-MP hematopoietic toxicity reveals a new host factor to
account for interindividual variation in thiopurine sensitivity/
toxicity. This frequent, less functional, MRP4 allele may account for
enhanced thiopurine sensitivity in some Japanese and may prompt
the development of clinical studies to test the relationship between
MRP4 alleles and thiopurine sensitivity. Moreover, given that the
MRP4 gene is highly polymorphic (8) and transports many
chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., camptothecins, methotrexate, etc.),
other MRP4 alleles are likely to contribute to unexplained
chemotherapeutic toxicity. Therefore, these findings indicate that
the effect of MRP4 variants on hematopoietic toxicity of other
chemotherapeutic agents merits investigation as a mechanism that
contributes to enhanced cytotoxicity.
