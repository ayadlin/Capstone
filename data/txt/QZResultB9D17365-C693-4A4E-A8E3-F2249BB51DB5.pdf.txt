ABSTRACT
Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that normally
functions in hematopoietic cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Constitutively
activating mutations of FLT3 map predominately to the juxtamembrane domain
(internal tandem duplications; ITD) or the activation loop (AL) of the kinase domain
and are detected in about 1/3 of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.
Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) effectively target FLT3/ITD mutations,
but some activating mutations, particularly those on the AL, are relatively resistant
to many FLT3 TKI. We reproduced many of the AL or other non-ITD activating
mutations and tested 13 FLT3 TKI for their activity against these and wild-type FLT3.
All 13 TKI tested inhibited BaF3/ITD cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent
manner as reported, but most TKI exhibited a wide range of differential activity
against AL and other point mutants. Western blotting results examining inhibition of
FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling pathways indicate that many AL mutations
reduce TKI binding. Most FLT3 TKI effectively target wild-type FLT3 signaling. As a
demonstration of this differential activity, treatment of BaF3 D835Y cells transplanted
in BALB/c mice with sorafenib showed no effect in vivo against this mutant whereas
lestaurtinib proved effective at reducing disease burden. Thus, while FLT3 TKI have
been selected based on their ability to inhibit FLT3/ITD, the selection of appropriate
TKI for AML patients with FLT3 AL and other activating point mutations requires
personalized consideration.

INTRODUCTION

dimerization, autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation
of other signaling proteins. [3, 4] This, in turn, leads to
activation of downstream signaling cascades, including
signal transducers of activation and transcription (STATs),
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) and
phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase/AKT pathways. Mutation
of FLT3 induces constitutive kinase activation which is
independent of ligand and occurs in about one-third of
AML cases. [5, 6] About 20-25% of AML patients express
FLT3 mutations as in-frame internal tandem duplications
(ITDs) of varying length in the juxtamembrane domain.
An additional 7-10% of patients harbor point mutations
of the kinase domain activation loop (AL) or other areas.
Point mutations within the juxtamembrane domain of

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a member
of the class III family of receptor tyrosine kinases,
including platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and
β, c-kit and fms. [1, 2] Their general structure consists
of five extracellular immunoglobin-like domains, a single
transmembrane domain, a short juxtamembrane region
and an interrupted kinase domain. FLT3 expression
is limited primarily to primitive hematopoietic stem/
progenitor cells and dendritic cells. It plays roles in the
processes of differentiation, survival and proliferation.
The kinase activity of FLT3 is normally stimulated upon
binding of FLT3 ligand (FL), which leads to receptor

Table 1: Proliferation IC50 (nM) of FLT3 TKI against AL mutants.

Proliferation half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at 48 h by MTT assay. The cells were grown in the absence of IL3
and analyzed by treatment in increasing concentrations of FLT3 TKI for 48 hours, after which growth inhibition was assessed
using the MTT assay. Each experiment was performed at least three times and representative results are shown.
FLT3 have also been detected and represent a rarer class of
activating mutations. [7, 8] The crystal structure of FLT3
shows that the juxtamembrane domain makes contact with
the activation loop and maintains FLT3 in an autoinhibited
state. [9] Mutations in the juxtamembrane domain or in
the activation loop destabilize the inhibitory conformation
and lead to constitutive FLT3 activation. Transfection of
plasmids containing either type of mutation into cytokinedependent hematopoietic cell lines transforms cells to
growth factor independence. [10] Activating mutations
of FLT3 are also observed at lower frequencies in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), [11, 12] myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) [13] and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)
rearranged infant leukemias. [14, 15]
Kinase domain mutations are primarily restricted
to the carboxy terminal portion of the catalytic domain,
predominately at residues D835 and I836 on the
activation loop. [6, 16, 17] The crystal structures of
related tyrosine kinases indicate that the activation
loop acts as a flexible gate to allow access of ATP and
substrate to the nucleotide-binding site when the molecule
assumes the “open” or active conformation. [9, 18-20]
In the “closed” or autoinhibited conformation, the FLT3
activation loop swings inward and binds to D811, thus
preventing ATP binding in this pocket. [9] Mutation
of critical residues in the kinase domain destabilize the
autoinhibited FLT3 structure, shifting the equilibrium
towards the open conformation, leading to constitutive
kinase activation in the absence of FLT3 ligand binding.

While all FLT3 activating kinase domain mutations
provide growth and survival advantages, there appear
to be signaling differences compared to ITD mutations.
[21, 22] Moreover, amongst the kinase domain mutations,
there are wide differences in response to FLT3 tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI). [23, 24] All TKI described as
FLT3 inhibitors target FLT3/ITD mutations, while some
of these TKI show limited activity against wild-type
FLT3, and most exhibit significantly reduced potency
at inhibiting some of the AL and other point mutations.
D835Y is the most frequently observed kinase domain
mutation in AML patients, constituting ~50% of all FLT3
AL missense mutations. [25] Other substitution mutations
detected less frequently at D835 include valine, histidine,
glycine, and asparagine substitutions as well as aspartic
acid codon deletion. [6, 16, 17, 26] The I836 codon also
undergoes deletion and/or mutation to threonine, serine or
leucine with or without an insertion. [6, 16] Several of the
additional mutations dispersed on the activation loop or
in the kinase domain have been documented in patients at
D593∆ [27] , S840 [28] , N841 [29] and Y842 [30] .
In this study, BaF3 cells transfected with different
FLT3 activating mutations reported in patients were tested
against a panel of 13 compounds characterized as FLT3
inhibitors. Five of them are currently in clinical trials for
treatment of acute myeloid leukemia including sorafenib
[31] , quizartinib [32] , midostaurin [33] , crenolanib
[34] and ponatinib [35] . Another FLT3 inhibitor, TTT3002, demonstrated high potency in FLT3/ITD and FLT3/

RESULTS

D835 mutated leukemia cell lines and patient samples in
preclinical studies [36, 37] . A wide range of responses
were noted to each mutation. The results show that
most inhibitors are not effective against some activating
mutations, or substantially higher drug concentrations
are required to inhibit proliferation of cells bearing these
particular mutations, concentrations unlikely to be reached
in these patients. The data presented here indicate that a
number of activating mutations render FLT3 insensitive
to some TKI, and determination of the particular mutation
expressed should be undertaken when deciding upon a
FLT3 TKI regimen for AML patients with AL and other
non-ITD point mutations.

Differential sensitivity of FLT3 AL mutants to
FLT3 TKI growth inhibition
The FLT3 AL mutations selected for use in this
study were all originally isolated from AML patients
and transfection of each into BaF3 cells led to IL-3
independent growth. Representative clones were obtained
following limiting dilution and their responses to FLT3
TKI were measured by MTT (growth/survival) assay. Each
of the 13 FLT3 TKI tested inhibited proliferation of BaF3/
ITD mutant cells in a concentration-dependent manner,
albeit with widely varying potencies (Table 1 and Figure
1). Lestaurtinib, midostaurin and TTT-3002 inhibited

proliferation in all FLT3 AL mutants with generally similar
or sometimes even greater potency compared to the FLT3/
ITD cells. In contrast, 10 of the 13 TKI tested displayed a
range of activity against FLT3 AL mutants. Multiple FLT3
TKI were active against the D835G, D835N, I836T and
840G+S mutants, with IC50 values within 10-fold of the
values for inhibiting the FLT3/ITD mutant (midostaurin,
lestaurtinib, linifanib, quizartinib, sutinib, sorafenib, TTT3002 and KW2449). However, at least 7 of the 13 FLT3
TKI tested had little or no activity against the D593∆,
D835Y, D835A, D835L+K, I836L+D and I836S mutants
(AG1295, AGS324, linifanib, quizartinib, sunitinib,
sorafenib and R406). For those 7 FLT3 TKI the IC50 was
not reached over the concentration range tested.
Only 4 of the FLT3 TKI tested in this study
inhibited growth of the most frequently seen clinical
FLT3 AL mutant D835Y. Midostaurin, lestaurtinib, TTT3002, and crenolanib inhibited growth of this mutant
at concentrations that were at least within 20-fold the
concentrations effective against the FLT3/ITD mutant,

whereas the other inhibitors were largely ineffective at the
FLT3/ITD inhibitory concentrations. Although ponatinib
is a potent inhibitor of the FLT3/ITD cells with an IC50
below 1 nM, the D835Y mutation shifted the IC50 to 92
nM (Table 1). The IC50 values for the rest of the inhibitors
evaluated against the D835Y mutation were beyond their
respective testing ranges in this study. These findings are
consistent with clinical data showing that treatment of
FLT3/ITD positive AML patients with monotherapy with
some FLT3 TKI has frequently given rise to blasts that
express D835Y, rendering the cells insensitive to further
therapy. [38] Midostaurin, lestaurtinib, TTT-3002, and
crenolanib were also the only FLT3 TKI in this study that
inhibited growth of the D593∆ mutant at IC50 levels close
to those observed in the FLT3/ITD mutant cells.
The FLT3 TKI could be ranked based on the number
of mutants they inhibited, with midostaurin, lestaurtinib,
and TTT-3002 inhibiting growth of all mutants in the
panel. Crenolanib and ponatinib inhibited all but 3 of the
mutants (D835L+K, I836T, and I836I), although it should

be noted that relatively high concentrations of ponatinib
were required to inhibit proliferation in D835Y and
D835A mutants. Sorafenib and KW2449 inhibited growth
of all but 5 mutants (D835Y, D835L+K, I836L+D, D593∆
and D835A for sorafenib; D835Y, D835L+K, I836L+D,
D593∆ and I836S for KW2449). Linifanib, quizartinib,
and sunitinib each inhibited all but 6 of the mutants,
whereas AGS324, AG1295, and R406 were ineffective
against 7 of the panel members. These results indicate that
treatment of AML patients using some FLT3 TKI would
be more effective against a greater spectrum of FLT3 AL
mutations than other FLT3 inhibitors.

underwent phase 3 clinical trials for FLT3 mutant AML.
To that end, we tested the ability of lestaurtinib and
midostaurin to inhibit FLT3 autophosphorylation of each
FLT3 AL mutant. Midostaurin (Figure 2a) and lestaurtinib
(Figure 2b) both inhibited FLT3 autophosphorylation of
all FLT3 AL mutants with IC50 values of 5 nM or lower.
The Western blotting results examining FLT3 inhibition
by lestaurtinib and midostaurin for each FLT3 AL mutant
correlate well with the MTT data.

that crenolanib inhibited FLT3 autophosporylation of
D835Y, D835A, D835G, D835N, I836L+D, 840G+S
and D593∆ mutants with IC50s of 36, 20, 28, 30, 15, 104
and 12nM, respectively (Figure 1c). Ponatinib inhibited
FLT3 autophosphorylation of D835Y, D835A, D835G,
D835N, I836L+D, 840G+S and D593∆ mutants with IC50
values of 5 nM or less (Figure 1d). However, crenolanib
and ponatinib were not nearly as effective at inhibiting
phosphorylation of D835L+K, I836S and I836T FLT3
mutants, with significant autophosphorylation still
observable even at concentrations of 200 nM (Figure 2c,
2d).

expression by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. [40]
These samples are often sensitive to FLT3 TKI, arguing
that wild-type FLT3 signaling is important in these cells.
Thus targeting of wild-type, non-mutant FLT3 may be
important for this subset of ALL and AML patients. Thus
it is important to study the effect of FLT3 TKI on wildtype FLT3 signaling as well. We determined the activity
of FLT3 TKI against BaF3/wild-type FLT3 expressing
cells that were stimulated with FL (Figure 3). Of the 12
FLT3 TKI tested, the majority of them inhibited FLT3
autophosphorylation of wild-type FLT3 with IC50 values
of 20 nM or lower. Only Crenolanib, R406 and AG1295
were not nearly as effective at inhibiting wild-type FLT3
phosphorylation compared to FLT3/ITD ( IC50 values
of 200 nM, 200 nM and 500 nM). Similar results were
seen whether cells were incubated with FL first followed
by FLT3 TKI treatment or FLT3 TKI followed by FL
stimulation.

Effect of FLT3 TKI on ITD versus D835Y
signaling pathways

(Figure 4). In FLT3 D835Y cells, lestaurtinib inhibited
FLT3 autophosphorylation with an IC50 < 2 nM which
resulted in termination of signaling through STAT5, AKT
and MAP kinase pathways (Figure 5). In contrast, even
the highest concentrations of sorafenib and AG1295 tested
showed markedly reduced or absent inhibition of FLT3
autophosphorylation and a subsequent lack of inhibitory
activity on phosphorylation of STAT5, AKT and MAP
kinase. Thus, for the 3 FLT3 TKI tested against the FLT3/
ITD and the FLT3 D835Y mutants, there was a good
correlation between inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation
and inhibition of FLT3 dependent downstream signaling
pathways.

The STAT5, PI-3 kinase/AKT and Ras/Map kinase
pathways are activated by FLT3 and are important in
cell survival and proliferation in cells that are dependent
on FLT3 activity. However, there are also extrinsic
mechanisms independent of FLT3, capable of maintaining
signaling pathways downstream of FLT3 despite the
presence of inhibitory FLT3 TKI levels. [41] In addition,
off-target effects of some TKI that cause inhibition of
downstream pathways might cause inhibition of growth
despite lack of inhibition against a FLT3 mutant. To
determine whether inhibition of FLT3 signaling pathways
correlated with inhibition of FLT3 autophosphorylation,
3 FLT3 TKI representing different classes of inhibitors
were tested against the FLT3/ITD and the FLT3 D835Y
mutants. Treatement with lestaurtinib, sorafenib and
AG1295 all inhibited FLT3 autophosphorylation as well
as phosphorylation of STAT5, AKT and Map kinase in
FLT3/ITD cells in a concentration-dependent manner

is synergistic and may lead to improved efficacy for those
patients. [45] FLT3 AL mutations also constitutively
activate FLT3 kinase activity and subsequent downstream
signaling pathways that lead to transformation and
cytokine independence, but do not appear to result in
worse prognosis than non-FLT3 mutant AML patients.
The addition of a FLT3 TKI to the therapy of FLT3 AL
mutant patients might still further improve their outcome
and appeared to do so in a recently reported trial of
midostaurin. [46] Unfortunately, many FLT3 AL mutations
fail to respond to many of the FLT3 TKI that have been
selected for by their potency against FLT3 ITD mutations.
[23, 24] Treatment of a FLT3 AL mutant patient with these
FLT3 TKI would fail to inhibit FLT3 kinase activity and
thus have no potential to contribute to the elimination
of leukemic blasts. Thus, in this era of personalized
medicine, it is important to know the exact FLT3 AL
mutation each patient carries in order to be able to pick
the most appropriate FLT3 TKI to use for that patient. This
is also important during therapy for a patient with a FLT3
ITD mutation because the FLT3 AL mutations appear to
arise frequently through selection in these patients under

were transplanted into syngeneic mice and were treated
with lestaurtinib or sorafenib. Because the cells were
stably transfected with luciferase, disease progression
could be monitored by visualizing bioluminescence upon
intraperitoneal injection of luciferin. Typically, these cells
home to the bone marrow and spread to the spleen and
peripheral blood before mice become moribund. By day
5 FLT3 D835Y cells were well engrafted in the mice. By
day 9, 4 days after treatment was instituted, the sorafenib
and vehicle treated mice demonstrated clear progression
of leukemia. In contrast, leukemic burden was greatly
reduced in mice treated with lestaurtinib, with only a
small amount of D835Y cells detected in the bone marrow
(Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
Nearly half of acute myeloid leukemia patients
treated with chemotherapy have a favorable outcome,
but those who present with a FLT3/ITD mutation have a
worse prognosis. [42-44] Preclinical and clinical evidence
suggest that the addition of a FLT3 TKI to chemotherapy

mice per group. On day 5 following transplantation, the level of engraftment was assessed by imaging mice for bioluminescence on an
IVIS Spectrum imager. Starting on day 5, mice were then treated twice daily by vehicle, subcutaneous lestaurtinib (20 mg/kg) or once
daily sorafenib (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage until day 9, at which point mice were again imaged. This experiment was repeated three times.

the pressure of FLT3 TKI therapy.
Most of the clinically available FLT3 TKI display
reduced activity against at least some of the FLT3 AL
mutants. In this study, only lestaurtinib, midostaurin and
TTT-3002 appear to be universally effective against this
type of mutation. Treatment with FLT3 TKIs other than
lestaurtinib, midostaurin, or TTT-3002 therefore, could
prove problematic if patients present with, or are selected
for during treatment, one of the FLT3 AL mutations. With
the increasing number of FLT3 TKI being developed
clinically, it is important to determine the spectrum of
FLT3 mutants that would respond to or be resistant to each
TKI. [47, 48] For example, sorafenib and quizartinib have
both demonstrated some efficacy in reducing peripheral
blasts in FLT3 ITD mutant AML patients and bone marrow
blasts in some cases, but the data from this study indicate
that neither of these inhibitors would be effective against
blasts harboring FLT3 mutations of D835Y, D835A,
D835L+K or I836L+D. [49-53] In addition, the D835G
and D835N mutations caused ~10-fold elevation in the
IC50 for sunitinib that would likely preclude its use against
these mutants.
We know that in infant ALL and in AML with the
highest level of wild-type FLT3 expression, FLT3 is
constitutively phosphorylated and the cells are sensitive to
FLT3 TKI. Therefore, studying the effect of FLT3 TKI on
wild-type FLT3 signaling is important. With the exception
of one of the TKI (AG1295) tested in this study, all of the
others showed a high level of activity against wild-type
FLT3 signaling. Thus FLT3 TKIs might prove effective for
upfront or relapsed therapy for these patients.
TKI are generally categorized as type I or type II
inhibitors. [54] Type I inhibitors directly compete with
ATP binding to the nucleotide-binding site and make
contact with the tyrosine kinase hinge region. Crystal
structures of kinases in complex with inhibitors indicate
that type I TKI bind target when the phosphorylated kinase
activation loop assumes either the active unfolded “open”
conformation or the inactive closed conformation. [55]
Type II inhibitors indirectly compete with ATP by binding
a hydrophobic allosteric site adjacent to the nucleotidebinding site in addition to the nucleotide-binding site.
These inhibitors only bind the target when the activation
loop assumes the “closed” conformation. Dasatinib is an
example of a type I inhibitor that binds BCR-ABL while
imatinib and nilotinib are examples of type II inhibitors.
[56] FLT3 mutations lead to constitutive activation by
two different mechanisms: ITD mutations that relieve
the negative regulatory influence of the juxtamembrane
domain on the catalytic domain and the AL mutants that
directly destabilize the activation loop. [9, 57] There are
suggestions that FLT3 TKI also fall into the category of
type I or type II inhibitors, but the biological data from
this study argue that this categorization, while technically
accurate, is likely an oversimplification. Midostaurin (and
lestaurtinib) is thought to be a type I inhibitor whereas
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sorafenib and many other FLT3 TKI are thought to belong
to the type II class. [58, 59] Since all FLT3 TKI inhibit
ITD mutations but display variable activity against kinase
domain mutants, the assertion that type II FLT3 TKI are
ineffective against some AL mutations because the kinase
is shifted toward the active conformation seems inadequate
as it should then hold true for all FLT3 AL mutations.
Instead, it is more probable that the activation loop of
specific FLT3 AL mutants adopts a conformation that
prohibits the DFG residues from forming hydrogen bonds
that are characteristic of binding with type II inhibitors,
thereby reducing drug affinity. The phenylalanine in
the DFG region of activated kinases has been shown to
move more than 10 Å from its position in the inhibited
conformation. [54] Almost certainly, different substitutions
on the activation loop will have varying effects on the
position of the DFG residues with subsequently varying
effects on the ability of type II FLT3 TKI to tightly bind
these mutants. An alternative explanation as to why type
II inhibitors might not be effective against FLT3 AL
mutants could be that some FLT3 AL mutations don’t
fully transition to the inactive conformation seen in the
autoinhibited form where the activation loop is completely
folded between the N and C kinase lobes.
The number of FLT3 activating kinase domain
mutations continues to grow and with that the need to
define the spectrum of activity of each FLT3 TKI against
these mutations. In this report, we demonstrated that TTT3002, lestaurtinib and midostaurin are fairly effective
against the known FLT3 AL mutants reported to date.
Despite the development of subsequent generations of
FLT3 TKI, many would not be effective in patients that
express a FLT3 AL mutation. Thus, there is still a need to
identify FLT3 TKI that can target multiple FLT3 activating
mutations, both FLT3 ITD and FLT3 AL types, in order to
improve upfront AML patient responses and to reduce the
incidence of selection of FLT3 AL resistance mutations.

Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA). Goat anti-mouse (#NA931)
and goat anti-rabbit (#NA934) horseradish peroxidase
antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit were
from Amersham Biosciences (Arlington Heights, IL,
USA).

in the presence or absence of inhibitor for 48 h. The effect
of drug activity on cell viability was measured using the
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN,
USA). Following treatment, cells were incubated for 4 h
in MTT followed by dissolution in solubilization buffer
overnight. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a BioRad plate reader (Hercules, CA, USA). The concentration
of drug that inhibited absorbance by 50% (IC50) was
calculated using CalcuSyn software. Results shown are
presented as means and are representative of at least three
independent experiments.

Immunoprecipitation and western blotting
Activated FLT3 expression was measured by
performing immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting as previously described. [60] Specifically, 107
cells were washed in medium and treated with inhibitor
for 1 h followed by stimulation with 25 ng/ml of FLT3
ligand for 15 minutes where indicated. Cells were washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 300 µl of NP-40
lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl (pH7.4), 10%
glycerol, 1% NP-40, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaF) with
2 mM Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors (Complete Tablets,
Roche, Mannheim, Germany) at 4°C for 30 m. Cell lysate
was harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 m
at 4°C. FLT3 S-18 antibody was incubated with 500 µg
lysate overnight at 4°C followed by immunoprecipitation
with protein A-agarose beads for 2 h. Beads were washed
once in Tris buffered saline with 1% Tween-20 (TBST)
and twice in TBS. Samples were boiled in sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) sample buffer prior to separating in a 8%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were
transferred to a polyvinyl diflouride (PVDF) membrane
(Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and detected by 4G10
phosphotyrosine antibody and anti-FLT3 S-18 antibody.
FLT3 was visualized using the Odyssey Infra Red Imaging
System from Li-Cor (Lincoln, NE, USA) using AlexaFluor
680 goat anti-mouse and AlexaFluor 800 goat anti-rabbit
antibodies. Phosphorylation of the FLT3 downstream
signaling mediators, STAT5, AKT and MAP kinase was
investigated by loading 50 µg of whole cell lysate and
probing with the indicated antibodies. The membrane
was washed and incubated in goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed
by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The membrane
was subsequently stripped in 200 mM glycine buffer,
pH 2.5 with 0.1% Tween-20 and reprobed for STAT5,
AKT and MAP kinase expression using the respective
antibodies.

DNA constructs and cells
BaF3 cells were grown cultured at 370C in 5% CO2
in RPMI medium (Invitrogen Corporation) with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland,
CA) containing penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen
Corporation) and supplemented with 1 ng/ml recombinant
human IL-3. FLT3 point mutations in BaF3 cells were
generated by site-directed mutagenesis in the pBabe
Neo vector containing wild-type FLT3 cDNA using the
QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit following the
manufacturer’s recommendations (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA, USA). Primers for each point mutation were designed
using Primer 3 software. All primers were ordered through
Invitrogen Corporation. Primer sequences are listed in
supplemental table 1.
All mutations were confirmed by sequencing.
Transfection was performed using the Nucleofector II
from Amaxa Biosystems (Walkersville, MD, USA), after
which cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 in the presence
of IL-3 and analyzed for FLT3 expression using CD135PE antibody on a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) using
CellQuest software. Clones were subsequently obtained
by limiting dilution and tested for their ability to grow
without IL-3. BaF3/ITD cells were established from a
patient sample as previously described. [60]

Engraftment in BALB/c mice

Editorial note

BaF3 D835Y cells were transfected with the
L3GFP plasmid (a gift from Dr. Linzhao Cheng of Johns
Hopkins University) containing genes for luciferase and
green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cells were sorted for
GFP and CD135 expression on a FACS AriaII cytometer
using FACSDiva software. For engraftment, 2 ×106 cells
were injected via tail vein into BALB/c mice (Jackson
Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) (day 0). Starting
five days later, mice were treated with either 20 mg/kg
of lestaurtinib twice daily by subcutaneous injection as
previously described or with the lestaurtinib vehicle to
serve as a control or 10 mg/kg sorafenib suspended in
30%(w/v) Cremophor EL, 30% (w/v) PEG 400, 10%
ethanol, and 10% glucose (all Sigma-Aldrich), once
daily by oral gavage. [36, 37] These drug doses have
previously been demonstrated to be effective against
FLT3/ITD in mice. Mice were imaged by intraperitoneal
injection of luciferin (3 mg) and visualizing on an IVIS
Spectrum imager (Caliper LifeSciences, Hopkinton, MA,
USA) using Living Image software for analysis on day
5 following inoculation to monitor engraftment and on
day 9 to assess drug effect. All animal procedures were
conducted in accordance with the policy of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine Animal Care and
Use Committee.

This paper has been accepted based in part on peerreview conducted by another journal and the authors’
response and revisions as well as expedited peer-review
in Oncotarget.
