Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

RRP1B (ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B) was first identified as a metastasis
susceptibility gene in breast cancer through its ability to modulate gene expression in a manner
that can be used to accurately predict prognosis in breast cancer. However, the mechanism(s) by
which RRP1B modulates gene expression is currently unclear. Many RRP1B binding candidates
are involved in alternative splicing, a mechanism of gene expression regulation that is increasingly
recognized to be involved in cancer progression and metastasis. One such target is SRSF1 (SF2/
ASF), an essential splicing regulator that also functions as an oncoprotein. Earlier studies
demonstrated that splicing and transcription occur concurrently and are coupled processes. Given
that RRP1B regulates transcriptional activity, we hypothesized that RRP1B also regulates the
expression of alternative mRNA isoforms through its interaction with SRSF1. Interaction between
RRP1B and SRSF1 was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence.
Treatment of cells with transcriptional inhibitors significantly increased this interaction,
demonstrating that the association of these two proteins is transcriptionally regulated. To assess
the role of RRP1B in the regulation of alternative isoform expression, RNA-seq data were
generated from control and Rrp1b-knockdown cells. Knockdown of Rrp1b induced a significant
change in isoform expression in over 600 genes compared to control cell lines. This was verified
by qRT-PCR using isoform-specific primers. Pathway enrichment analyses identified cell cycle
and checkpoint regulation to be those most affected by Rrp1b knockdown. These data suggest that
RRP1B suppresses metastatic progression by altering the transcriptome through its interaction
with splicing regulators such as SRSF1.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

RRP1B (ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B) was first identified as a metastasis
susceptibility gene through expression quantitative trait locus analysis of polyoma middle-T
transgene-induced mammary tumors. Studies of these tumors revealed that the expression of
Rrp1b highly correlated with the expression of extracellular matrix genes (1). Abnormal
regulation of extracellular matrix genes is commonly observed in human and mouse tumors,
and serves a predictive signature of metastases (2, 3). Microarray analyses demonstrated that
ectopic expression of Rrp1b in mouse mammary tumor cell lines has profound effects on
global gene expression. In addition, an expression signature generated from these microarray
data accurately predicted overall survival in multiple breast cancer patient datasets (1).
Finally, the importance of this gene as a germline suppressor of tumor progression and
metastasis in human breast cancer was further underscored by the observation that a nonsynonymous coding polymorphism in RRP1B (1421C>T; P436L; rs9306160) is
reproducibly associated with metastasis-free survival in multiple human breast cancer
cohorts (1, 4).

Human RRP1B is composed of 758 amino acids, and contains an amino-terminal NOP52
domain, and three nuclear localization signals located near the carboxy-terminus. Mouse
RRP1B is 724 amino acids long and shares 62% sequence similarity with human RRP1B.
RRP1B interacts with chromatin as well as rRNA transcripts, and its localization is almost
entirely nuclear, with the majority of RRP1B being found in the nucleolus (5, 6). The
mechanism underlying the functions of RRP1B largely remains to be identified.
Characterization of potential binding candidates of RRP1B through tandem affinity
purification and mass spectrometry provided some insight on this matter (5). A large number
of these candidates were involved in alternative mRNA splicing, two prominent examples of
which are SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) and CROP. SRSF1 is an essential splicing regulator that assists
in the formation of the spliceosome by binding with U1 snRNP (7), and influences the
selection of alternative splice sites (8, 9). CROP is the human homolog of yeast Luc7p,
which is an essential component of yeast U1 snRNP (10), and it has been shown to interact
with SRSF1 through yeast two-hybrid assays (11).

Author Manuscript

Alternative mRNA splicing is an essential method of regulating eukaryotic gene expression
in which a single pre-mRNA is subsequently spliced to generate various transcripts yielding
different protein products. Cells or tissues control alternative splicing in response to
different physiological states. Dysregulation of mRNA splicing in most cases leads to severe
diseases, including cancer (12). In cancerous tissues, it was found that the level of mRNA
splicing and the number of transcript variants are comparable to those of normal tissues (13).
Yet, neoplastic tissues do express an altered transcriptome characterized by tumor-specific
isoforms (14–16). It is unclear whether this is a direct cause or a secondary effect of tumor
progression (17).

The aim of this study is to examine whether RRP1B plays a role in regulating mRNA
splicing. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to measure changes in isoform
expression in response to Rrp1b knockdown, and biochemical approaches were used to
assess the interaction of RRP1B and additional proteins involved in splicing. RRP1B was
confirmed to interact with the splicing regulator SRSF1 and spliceosomal protein CROP.
Knockdown of Rrp1b increased the metastatic activity of mouse mammary tumor cells and
caused a significant change in isoform expression in 658 different genes. Based on these
findings, we conclude that RRP1B functions as a metastasis suppressor by regulating gene
expression, most likely at the mRNA level.

Results
RRP1B interacts with the splicing regulator SRSF1

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The splicing regulator and oncoprotein SRSF1 (18) was identified as a potential binding
factor of RRP1B (5, 6). Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous RRP1B and SRSF1 was
confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1A). Co-localization of the two proteins was
observed in speckles in the nucleus of cells overexpressing wild-type RRP1B (Figure 1B).
To identify the region of RRP1B that interacts with SRSF1, 293T cells were transfected with
a series of HA-tagged RRP1B deletion constructs; ΔN (Δ9–220), in which the highly
conserved NOP52 domain was deleted, ΔMID (Δ221–435), which does not have the middle
region containing the first nuclear localization signal, and ΔC (Δ452–749), in which the two
nuclear localization signals in the C-terminus were deleted (5). Interaction with SRSF1 that
was observed with wild-type RRP1B was lost upon deletion of the C-terminus of RRP1B,
implying that this portion of RRP1B mediates the interaction between these two proteins
(Figure 1C). However, deletion of the C-terminus of RRP1B has been shown to disrupt its
localization and cause partial redistribution into the cytoplasm (5). Therefore, although a
significant amount remains in the nucleus, the loss of interaction between RRP1B and
SRSF1 observed with the ΔC construct might be due, in part, to the redistribution of RRP1B
to the cytoplasm.
In addition to SRSF1, RRP1B was found to interact with another factor involved in splicing,
the spliceosomal protein CROP (Figure 1C, D). Co-immunoprecipitation patterns of CROP
with RRP1B were similar to that of SRSF1, where interaction was lost with the deletion of
the C-terminus, but not with the deletion of the N-terminus (Figure 1C).
The interaction between RRP1B and SRSF1 is transcriptionally regulated

Author Manuscript

Many studies have shown that transcription and splicing occur concurrently and that their
mutual progression is highly intertwined (19–23). With this in mind, and given the fact that
RRP1B is a critical regulator of metastasis-related transcriptional programs (1), we
hypothesized that the interaction between RRP1B and SRSF1 is transcriptionally dependent.
To test this hypothesis, transcription in MDA-MB-231 cells was inhibited using either 5,6Dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) or Actinomycin D (Act D). DRB
inhibits transcription by binding near the ATP binding site of CDK9 (24), an essential kinase
subunit of Positive Transcription Elongation Factor. Act D is a DNA intercalator that
inhibits transcription by interfering with the progression of RNA polymerase (25).

In cells treated with 25 μg/mL DRB or 2.5 μg/mL and 5 μg/mL Act D, interaction between
endogenous RRP1B and SRSF1 increased significantly compared to control (Figure 2A,
lane 1–4). These concentrations inhibit transcription mediated by RNA polymerase I and II
when added to the medium (26). Longer DRB treatment increased the degree of interaction
between the two proteins (Figure 2A, lane 5, 6). This increase in interaction was confirmed
through immunofluorescence as well, where co-localization of endogenous RRP1B and
SRSF1 occurred in larger aggregates within the nuclei with 2 h DRB treatment (Figure 2B).
We also observed redistribution of RRP1B from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm with DRB
treatment, which causes disruption of the nucleoli, as previously described (6). As the two
inhibitors, DRB and Act D, function through distinct pathways to inhibit transcription, it is
most likely that the interaction between RRP1B and SRSF1 is affected downstream of the
transcriptional process, rather than through a common upstream pathway.

Knockdown of Rrp1b increases cell invasiveness in vitro and metastasis in vivo

Author Manuscript

The effects of stable shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rrp1b were examined in the highly
metastatic mouse mammary tumor cell lines Mvt-1 (27) and 4T1 (28). For the Mvt-1 cell
line, clonal isolates were selected by serial dilution. RRP1B knockdown in both Mvt-1
clones and 4T1 cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting (Figure 3A, B).
Knockdown of RRP1B caused an increase in cell proliferation in both cell lines in culture
(Figure 3C, D). When injected into the mammary fat pads of syngenic FVB/NJ mice, Rrp1b
knockdown in the Mvt-1 cell line significantly reduced primary tumor burden and produced
an approximately six-fold increase in pulmonary surface metastasis compared to controls
(Figure 3E). This increase in metastasis with Rrp1b knockdown was reproduced with the
orthotopic injection of the 4T1 cell cultures into the mammary fat pads of syngenic BALB/c
mice (Figure 3F). To examine in vitro cell invasiveness, Mvt-1 clonal isolates were plated in
control or Matrigel chambers. With overnight incubation, Rrp1b-knockdown cell lines
displayed an average two-fold increase in invasion compared to control (Figure 3G). In
addition, Rrp1b-knockdown cell lines formed more colonies in soft agar compared to
control, demonstrating an increase in anchorage-independent cell growth (Figure 3H, I).
Increase in cell proliferation and cell invasiveness was observed with the human breast
carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell line as well (Figure S1). Such changes in cell behavior are
likely either primary events or secondary to the in vitro increase in cell proliferation rate
following Rrp1b knockdown.
RNA-seq analysis demonstrates that knockdown of Rrp1b induces differential gene and
isoform expression

Author Manuscript

Based on the metastatic activity observed in vivo, duplicate control and Rrp1b-knockdown
Mvt-1 clonal isolate cell lines were selected for RNA-seq. Gene expression analysis of the
RNA-seq data demonstrated that 615 genes displayed significant changes in transcript levels
following Rrp1b knockdown, with 362 up-regulated and 253 down-regulated genes at a q ≤
0.05 genome-wide significance level (Figure 4A, Table S1). Pathway enrichment analysis
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, www.ingenuity.com) indicated that cell cycle
regulation was a major function of these genes affected by Rrp1b expression (Table 1).

To examine the role of RRP1B in the regulation of alternative isoforms, we analyzed
differential isoform expression between control and knockdown cell lines. Similar to the
results seen in gene expression, a substantial difference was observed in isoform expression;
699 isoforms, representing 658 different genes, were identified as having a significant
change in expression with Rrp1b knockdown (Figure 4B, Table S2). Four hundred and
ninety seven of the 699 isoforms displayed differential gene expression, with the remaining
202 isoforms not being identified in the aforementioned gene expression analysis (Figure
4C). The locations of isoform-specific exons were profiled by comparing them to a
transcript constructed in silico that included all exons from annotated isoforms. These data
demonstrated that the majority of differential exons regulated by RRP1B are located
internally between the first and last exon. Changes in the first exon may be due to
differential promoter utilization, whereas changes in internal exons indicate true differences
in mRNA splicing. For all 699 isoforms profiled, 59% of differential exons were located
internally within the transcript (e.g., Tapbp-001 exon 3; Figure 5), 27.2% were in the 5′
region or the first exon (e.g., Arl8a-001 exon 1; Figure 5), and 13.8% were in the 3′ region
or the last exon.

Author Manuscript

Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to gain more insight on the isoforms affected
by Rrp1b knockdown. Depending on the number of molecules identified to support each
pathway, there was some variation in the significance (determined by Benjamini-Hochberg
correction of p-values) of each pathway between the gene and isoform expression. For
example, p53 signaling ranked as the 4th most significant pathway in the gene analysis with
a −log(B-H p-value) of 3.73, whereas it ranked 9th in the isoform analysis with a −log(B-H
p-value) of 3.59. Despite these differences in p-values, the majority of the significant
pathways, which was determined by a −log(B-H p-value) of 1.30 or higher (p-value ≤ 0.05),
overlapped between the two analyses. The top pathways for differential gene and isoform
expression analyses are shown in Table 1 and 2, respectively. As was the case with the gene
expression analyses, the most highly represented molecular and cellular functions and
pathways were those involved in cell-cycle and checkpoint regulation (Table 2).
Surprisingly, the differentially expressed isoforms were not of genes involved in pathways
involved in alternative mRNA splicing. Among the 54 splicing-related factors screened (29),
which included hnRNPs and SR proteins, only two genes, Hnrnph2 (30, 31) and Srsf5
(Srp40) (32, 33) were identified to have differential isoform expression with the knockdown
of Rrp1b. Thus, the large-scale change in isoform expression observed with Rrp1b
knockdown is likely a direct effect of RRP1B itself, rather than a secondary effect caused by
the factors regulated by RRP1B.

Author Manuscript

To confirm the differential regulation of alternative isoforms by RRP1B, qRT-PCR
expression analysis was performed with Mvt-1 control and Rrp1b-knockdown samples.
Isoform-specific primers were designed to either extend across a unique exon junction or lie
within an isoform-specific exon (Figure 5, arrows). For instance, for Tubb5-001 and
Tubb5-003, the junction region spanning between exon 1 and 2 is unique for each isoform as
the sequence for exon 2 differs between the two isoforms. For expression analysis, two
isoforms were selected for each gene with one isoform being identified by RNA-seq as
being dysregulated by Rrp1b knockdown (Figure 5, top isoform) and the other having no

significant change (Figure 5, bottom isoform). These analyses confirmed that Rrp1b
regulates gene expression in an isoform-specific manner.

Author Manuscript

Splicing patterns vary greatly across different species and tissues (34), and the level of
conservation for orthologous genes ranges from 11 to 20% (35–37). To see if the change in
splicing observed with Rrp1b knockdown was cell-line specific, the expression of the
isoforms in Figure 5 were also examined in clonal isolates of stable 4T1 Rrp1b-knockdown
cells and compared to that of the Mvt-1 cell lines (Figure S2). Many of the isoforms changed
expression in the same direction with similar Log(fold change) values, while a few of them,
such as Arl8a-003 and Rpa2-001, demonstrated divergent expression patterns. This variation
is not unexpected given the different genetic background of the two cell lines. Further, it is
unlikely that these minor differences in splicing have a significant impact upon metastasis
since knockdown of Rrp1b in both Mvt-1 and 4T1 cell lines resulted in very similar in vitro
and in vivo behaviors.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

With the discovery of the diverse functions of RNA transcripts, increasing interest has been
placed upon the role of alternative splicing in tumor progression. Although neoplastic tissues
have been reported to display a perturbation in mRNA isoform expression compared to
matched normal tissues (14–16, 38), the precise role of this altered transcriptome and
splicing pattern in tumorigenesis remains uncertain. Previously, it was shown that the
metastasis suppressor Nm23-H1 regulates changes in the expression of RNA posttranscriptional modification proteins, including Gemin5, a component of the spliceosome
(39). Yet, a direct role for metastasis modifiers in splicing has not yet been reported,
although it seems that many factors involved in splicing have a variety of cellular functions
(40). Here, using RNA-seq in combination with other biochemical methods, the metastasis
modifier RRP1B has been demonstrated to directly regulate alternative isoform expression.
This suggests that alternative splicing, and the diverse isoforms generated from that process,
may play a role in the regulation of various factors implicated in metastasis.

Author Manuscript

Alternative mRNA splicing is a fundamental cellular mechanism involved in the regulation
of gene expression, and it has been reported that the majority of human genes is alternatively
spliced to express different isoforms (41). It is a precisely regulated process that consists of
specific splice recognition sites, splicing machinery, and other regulatory factors. Defects in
splicing can occur at any stage of the process, and have been shown to be features of a widerange of diseases, including cancer. Since alternative splicing is a tightly-regulated process,
mutations in most, but not all, splicing factors result in a change in splicing patterns (42). In
addition, many studies demonstrate that relatively few genes have altered splicing patterns in
primary tumor tissue compared to matched normal tissue (43, 44).
Considering these facts, the fundamental question posed by our research is whether the
metastasis modifier RRP1B is modulating cellular splicing patterns. Our data does indeed
indicate that this is the case since our analysis of the transcriptome of the highly metastatic
Mvt-1 cell line clearly demonstrates that Rrp1b knockdown induces widespread changes in
isoform expression. Specifically, the majority of the isoform-specific exons induced by

knockdown of Rrp1b were found to be located internally within the mature mRNA. Given
that splicing is used to generate different mature mRNA isoforms from the same pre-mRNA,
we argue that these changes in internal exon composition upon Rrp1b knockdown can only
arise due to changes in splicing regulation. In addition, interaction between RRP1B and the
splicing regulator SRSF1, as well as with spliceosomal protein CROP (Figure 1), supports
the direct involvement of RRP1B in splicing, rather than indirect regulation of splicing, such
as that of Nm23-H1 (39). We would, however, like to stress that the mechanism of action of
RRP1B is likely not entirely dependent on its role in splicing regulation. In particular, we
acknowledge that a sizable proportion of the isoform-specific exons expressed as a
consequence of Rrp1b knockdown are located at the 5′ region of the transcript. Expression
of these isoforms has likely been induced through the utilization of alternative promoters.
Our previous work has demonstrated that RRP1B interacts with a variety of chromatinassociated factors. Therefore, expression of this type of isoform with alternative 5′ exons is
likely a consequence of RRP1B interacting with these chromatin-associated binding partners
rather than splicing regulators.

Author Manuscript

An extensive study on the nuclear protein interactome of RRP1B by Chamousset et al. found
that it was enriched with ribosomal subunit proteins, particularly those of the large subunit
(6). This suggests that RRP1B plays an important role in cell growth and metabolism, as the
ribosome is regulated in response to signals controlling these pathways. A large number of
genes encoding components of both the 60S large and 40S small ribosomal subunits
displayed differentially expressed isoforms with the knockdown of Rrp1b. Interestingly, all
of the dysregulated components of the small ribosomal subunit except for Rps19, as well as
7 of the 12 dysregulated large ribosomal subunit genes were those encoding the previously
identified components of the RRP1B protein interactome (highlighted in Table S2). This
demonstrates that RRP1B not only interacts with ribosomal protein subunits in the nucleus,
but also controls their expression. Not surprisingly, the cellular pathways most affected by
the knockdown of Rrp1b were those involved in cell cycle regulation. Collectively, these
findings suggest a greater role for RRP1B as a regulator of cell growth than previously
reported, which explains the significant change in in vitro cell proliferation observed here.

Author Manuscript

Many studies demonstrate that splicing and transcription occur concurrently, rather than
sequentially, and that splicing is affected by the rate and progression of transcription, which
is affected by events at the chromatin, such as histone modification (19–23). An earlier
study that identified potential binding factors of RRP1B through tandem affinity purification
found that these proteins can be largely classified as either chromatin-associated or splicingrelated factors, and confirmed RRP1B interaction with chromatin-associated factors (5). In
addition, we observed interaction between RNA polymerase II and RRP1B through coimmunoprecipitation (Figure S3). These studies combined with our findings here suggest a
role for RRP1B as a mediator between the transcription complex and splicing factors (Figure
6), and that differential levels of RRP1B impacts the transcriptome, and ultimately
metastasis. To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly link a metastasis modifier to
regulation of alternative splicing machinery and subsequent alterations in cellular mRNA
splicing patterns.

Cell culture and transient transfection
Cell lines were a gift from Dr. Lalage Wakefield, NCI/NIH. All cell lines were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY). For transient transfections, cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells in 12-well plates
for RNA isolation or at 2 × 106 cells in 100 mm plates for protein isolation. The next day,
transfection was performed using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA)
following manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection for analyses.
Generation of stable RRP1B-knockdown cell lines

Author Manuscript

For Rrp1b knockdown in the Mvt-1 and 4T1 cell lines, a shRNA targeting mouse Rrp1b
inserted into the pSuper.retro.puro vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) was transfected along
with retroviral packaging vectors. Mvt-1 and 4T1 cells expressing the vector were selected
in 10 μg/mL or 5 μg/mL of puromycin, respectively. Stable RRP1B-knockdown cells were
also established in MDA-MB-231 cells using shRNA targeting human RRP1B. Knockdown
at the protein level was confirmed using polyclonal antibodies against RRP1B (6). Oligo
sequences for shRNAs are provided in Table S3.
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA)
following manufacturer’s protocol with a 15 min DNase treatment before elution. RNA
concentration was measured using NanoDrop (Wilmington, DE), and 1 μg of total RNA was
used per reverse transcription reaction in a final volume of 20 μL. Reverse transcription was
performed using cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The obtained cDNA was
then diluted 10-fold, and 1 μL was used for each 5 μL real-time PCR reaction. Primers used
for qRT-PCR are provided in Table S3.
Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting

Author Manuscript

For co-immunoprecipitation, cells in 100 mm plates were collected with 250 μL 1X lysis
buffer (600 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 40 mM Tris pH 7.4, 4 mM MgCl2, 2% Triton-X).
After 30 min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g at 4 °C for 5 min.
From each sample, 5 μL of the supernatant was removed as Input, and the balance was
diluted to a final volume of 800 μL and incubated with rotation at 4 °C with one of the
following antibodies: anti-HA (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) for HA-tagged RRP1B constructs,
anti-RRP1B (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for endogenous RRP1B, or IgG (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) as a negative control. After 2 h, 20 μL of DynaBeads (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY)
washed and resuspended in 1X lysis buffer were added to each immunoprecipitation and
incubated with rotation overnight at 4 °C. The following day, samples were washed with 1X
lysis buffer and resuspended in 2X sample buffer. Samples were separated on a 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen).

Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/mL in 2-well glass chamber slides. Following transfection
with HA-tagged RRP1B or treatment with DMSO, DRB, or Act D, cells were washed three
times with 1X PBS and fixed with Histochoice Tissue Fixative (AMRESCO, Solon, OH) for
15 min. Cells were washed three additional times with 1X PBS and permeated with Triton
100-X for 15 min. After blocking with 0.5% BSA in 0.1% Tween PBS for 30 min, cells
were incubated with the appropriate antibodies (anti-HA, Roche 11 867 423 001; antiRRP1B, Sigma HPA017893; anti-SF2, Invitrogen 32–4600; anti-CROP, Sigma
HPA018475) for co-immunofluorescence in 0.1% BSA in 0.1% Tween PBS for 1 h at room
temperature with rotation. After washing three times with 0.1% Tween PBS, cells were
incubated with the appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa
Fluor 594, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. Cells were then mounted
with VECTASHIELD with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized
with LSM 510 NLO (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, New York).
Orthotopic mammary fat pad injection
Female FVB/NJ and BALB/c mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
ME). Injections and metastasis assays were performed as previously described (1). Briefly, 1
× 105 cells in 100 μL saline were orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pads of 6 to
8-week-old female mice. Lungs and tumors were collected 4 weeks later. All animal
experiments were performed in compliance with the National Human Genome Research
Institute Animal Care and Use Committee’s guidelines.
Soft agar and Matrigel invasion assays

Author Manuscript

For soft agar assays, Mvt-1 and 4T1 cells were plated at 2 × 103 cells per 24-well in 0.33%
agar, and incubated for 7 days. MDA-MB-231 cells, 4 × 103 cells were plated in 0.33% agar
in 24-well plates and allowed to grow for 15 days until significant colony formation was
observed. Cells were then stained with 0.005% crystal violet for colony counting. For
Matrigel invasion assays, control and Rrp1b-knockdown stable Mvt-1 cell lines were plated
at 7.5 × 103 cells per 24-well control Transwell or Matrigel invasion chambers (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, California) in DMEM 0% FBS and chambers were placed in DMEM
10% FBS. Chambers were collected and stained with crystal violet the next day for
counting.
RNA-seq

Author Manuscript

For mRNA library construction, mRNA from 10 μg of total RNA was poly-A selected using
Dynal Oligo (dT) beads (Invitrogen) and sheared to ~400 b using Covaris S2. The sample
was concentrated to 25 μl using an Amicon Ultra 20K filter. Reverse transcription was
performed using random hexamers and SuperScript® Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Invitrogen). A library was constructed from the resulting cDNA according to the Illumina
protocol in the Paired-End DNA Sample Prep Oligo Only Kit. All additional enzymes were
purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) with the exception of Platinum Pfx
(Invitrogen). After paired-end adapter ligation, the sample was size selected on a 2% agarose
gel. Test amplification was performed by removing aliquots of a PCR reaction every 2

were evaluated on a 2% agarose gel and an optimal cycle number was selected for
subsequent large scale amplification. Amplification reactions were cleaned up using two
rounds of Agencourt AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Libraries were
quantitated by qPCR using Power Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Grand
Island, NY). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx platform using ver. 4
chemistry to obtain 76-base-paired reads. Data was processed using RTA1.8.70.0 and
CASAVA 1.7.0. Those reads that passed the Illumina platform quality check were kept for

A reference genome-guided strategy was used to assemble transcripts from the RNA-seq
data. Sequence reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm9; downloaded from
ENSEMBL) using TopHat (v. 1.2.0) (45) with the following parameters: -p 3; -m 2; -r 348; G (GTF of protein-coding transcripts downloaded from ENSEMBL (e64)). TopHat
alignments were supplied to Cufflinks (v. 1.1.0) (46) for transcript assembly using the
following parameters: -p 6; -N (upper quartile normalization); -b [mm9 genome FASTA
sequence for bias correction]; -M (GTF from ENSEMBL (e61) of rRNA, tRNA, and
mtRNA genomic locations for masking); GTF of protein-coding transcripts from
ENSEMBL (e64). Differentially expressed genes and transcripts were identified using
Cuffdiff (v. 1.1.0) with the following parameters: -p 6; -N (upper quartile normalization); -b
(mm9 genome fasta sequence for bias correction (47)); -M (GTF of rRNA, tRNA, and
mtRNA genomic locations for masking); GTF of protein-coding transcripts from
ENSEMBL (e64). Genes and isoforms having a q-value ≤ 0.05 were considered
differentially expressed, as reported in the gene_exp.diff and isoform_exp.diff output files
from Cuffdiff. Pathway enrichment was analyzed using IPA (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood
City, CA) using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction on p-values generated from a Fisher’s
Exact test.

To determine the frequency at which the first exon, internal exons, or the last exon of a gene
is alternatively expressed, a primary transcript was constructed in silico that included all
exons from the annotated isoforms (ENSEMBL e64) for a given protein-coding gene. The
differentially expressed isoforms were compared to these primary transcripts for differences
in the ENSEMBL-annotated genomic positions of exon start and stop locations. A record
was kept if differences in exon usage and/or exon junction positions occurred in the initial 5′
exon (first exon), final 3′ exon (last exon), or an exon that is not the initial 5′ or final 3′ exon
(internal).
