Abstract

Author Manuscript

Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a proliferative disorder of IgM secreting,
lymphoplasmacytoid cells that inhabit the lymph nodes and bone marrow. The disease carries a
high prevalence of activating mutations in MyD88 (91%) and CXCR4 (28%). Because signaling
through these pathways leads to Bcl-xL induction, we examined Bcl-2 family expression in WM
patients and cell lines. Unlike other B-lymphocyte-derived malignancies, which become dependent
on expression of anti-apoptotic proteins to counter expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, WM
samples expressed both pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins at low levels similar to their normal
B-cell and plasma cell counterparts. Three WM cell lines expressed pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members Bim or Bax and Bak at low levels which determined their sensitivity to inducers of
intrinsic apoptosis. In two cell lines, miR-155 upregulation, which is common in WM, was
responsible for inhibition of FOXO3a and Bim expression. Both antagonizing miR-155 to induce

Bim and proteasome inhibition increased the sensitivity to ABT-737 in these lines indicating a
lowering of the apoptotic threshold. In this manner, treatments that increase pro-apoptotic protein
expression increase the efficacy of agents treated in combination in addition to direct killing.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since the discovery of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), nearly three decades ago, the Bcl-2
family of proteins has been shown to regulate the process of apoptosis in all mammalian
1
cells . Bcl-2 family regulation of apoptosis culminates in the pro-apoptotic BH3-only
activator proteins Bim, tBid and Puma transiently associating with and causing a
2
conformational change in the multi-domain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak . Upon their
activation, Bax and Bak homo-oligomerize and initiate mitochondrial outer membrane
3
permeabilization (MOMP) . When Bim or tBid are present a cell must also express antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to block apoptosis. The set of known anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins now includes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bcl-w, Bcl-b and A1/Bfl-1, which are
4
capable of binding BH3-only activators as well as activated monomers of Bax and Bak .
Expression of these proteins is capable of blocking apoptosis provided they are expressed at
levels in excess of pro-apoptotic proteins. This balance can be shifted, however, by the
expression of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins termed sensitizers including Hrk, Bad, Bik,
Bmf and Noxa. Sensitizers bind the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with varying affinities and
are capable of displacing Bim, tBid, Puma or activated Bax and Bak leading to MOMP and
5
apoptosis .

Processes of proliferation and differentiation induce death signals in the form of proapoptotic protein expression that are countered by survival signals that induce expression of
anti-apoptotic proteins. For example, enforced expression of the proliferative oncogene cmyc leads to proliferation but also leads to apoptosis. However, co-expression of Bcl-2 or
any other anti-apoptotic family member with c-myc rescues this cell death resulting in tumor
6
formation , 7. In this manner a cancer cell that breaks a differentiation or proliferation
checkpoint must then compensate for the inherent activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members with increased expression of anti-apoptotic family members. This has come to be
known as mitochondrial priming in that cancer cells become primed for death by increased
5
abundance of pro-apoptotic protein being sequestered by anti-apoptotic proteins . In this
way the apoptotic threshold of a cancer cell is lowered because it requires less death
signaling to engage mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, it has been shown that
the level of priming of a variety of cancers and healthy tissues determines their response to
8
various anti-cancer agents illustrating a basis for the therapeutic index seen in-vivo .

mutations have been shown to be common in WM. The MyD88 (L265P) mutation is found
11
in 91% of WM cases , 12 and the CXCR4 (S338X) mutation is found in nearly a third of
WM cases. Since both MyD88 and CXCR4 signaling lead to downstream activation of NFκB which induces Bcl-xL, and since we have shown that differentiating plasma cells proceed
13
through a Bcl-xL-dependent intermediate , we hypothesized that WM cells are dependent
on Bcl-xL for survival. In this study we examined the Bcl-2 protein expression in WM
patient samples and observed that WM cells are characterized by low expression of both
pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. This is in sharp contrast with the plasma cell
tumor, multiple myeloma (MM), which is characterized by increased expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to compensate for increased expression of Bim. These data
provide evidence that the apoptotic threshold in WM cells is high due to low expression of
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members not due to high expression of anti-apoptotic proteins.

RESULTS

Author Manuscript

We examined Bcl-2 protein expression in a published expression database containing 10
WM patients along with 11 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, 12 multiple
myeloma (MM) patients, 8 normal B-cell (NBL) donors and 5 normal plasma cell (NPC)
14
donors . All patients in the study were newly diagnosed and untreated. The WM cells were
separated pairwise by patient based on their B-cell-like (WBL) or plasma cell-like (WPC)
phenotype. We performed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 14 Bcl-2 family genes
in all samples (Figure 1A). Interestingly, these Bcl-2 family genes alone were sufficient to
14
cluster the various cell types . The greatest separation based on gene expression of the cell
types was between the B-cell-like (NBL, CLL, WBL), and plasma cell-like (WPC, NPC,
MM) groups indicating that Bcl-2 family expression is primarily driven by the state of
differentiation, not transformation. We therefore split these groups and performed an
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these same 14 genes on the set of B-cell like or
plasma cell like groups separately. In the B-cell-like group, we observed a pattern where
NBL samples expressed lower levels of Bcl-2 proteins than CLL samples and WBL samples
were split between being similar to NBL and CLL samples (Figure S1A). An exception to
this was Bak which was underexpressed in WBL samples compared to CLL samples and
Bid which was overexpressed in WBL samples compared to CLL samples (Figure S1B).
Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was expressed at higher levels in both CLL and WBL samples
compared to NBL samples while, interestingly, Bcl2A1 was overexpressed in WBL samples
compared with both NBL and CLL samples (Figure S1C)

We observed that WPC samples clustered more closely with NPC samples not MM samples
and that in general WPC and NPC samples expressed lower levels of Bcl-2 family proteins
than MM samples (Figure 1B). Analysis of specific genes revealed that pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members Bak and Bim were expressed at significantly lower levels in WPC samples
compared to MM samples while Bid was expressed at higher levels in WPC than MM
samples (Figure 1C). Furthermore, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Mcl-1 and Bcl-w
were both expressed at significantly lower levels in WPC samples than MM samples (Figure
1D). All other Bcl-2 family proteins including Bcl-xL were expressed at levels not
significantly different in WPC samples compared with either NPC or MM samples (Figure
1A and data not shown). These data demonstrate that plasma cell phenotype WM cells

express Bcl-2 family proteins at levels more similar to normal plasma cells than MM which
is indicative of WM cells having a higher apoptotic threshold.

In order to determine the effects of Bcl-2 family protein expression on WM cell survival, we
obtained three previously described, plasma cell phenotype WM cell lines, BCWM.1,
15 17
MWCL-1 and RPCI-WM1 – . We then assessed Bcl-2 family protein expression in three
WM cell lines compared to two MM cell lines. We observed low to moderate levels of the
anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, the last of which was nearly undetectable in
RPCI-WM1 cells (Figure 2A). All three WM cell lines expressed Bid at higher levels than
the MM cell lines and both BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells expressed moderate levels of
Puma (Figure 2B). Strikingly, we observed marked defects in the expression of Bak, Bax
and Bim in these cell lines (Figure 2B). BCWM.1 cells expressed Bim at a very low level
and MWCL-1 cells expressed no detectable Bim. RPCI-WM1 cells expressed Bim at
moderate levels compared to MM cell lines however expressed very little Bak and no
detectable Bax. We then examined the mRNA expression of these genes in the cell lines and
observed very low levels of Bim mRNA in both BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells (Figure 2C).
While RPCI-WM1 cells displayed levels of Bak mRNA expression comparable to the other
cell lines, only very low levels of Bax mRNA was detected indicating distinct mechanisms
of down regulation of these two proteins (Figure 2D, E). We then examined the expression
of Bim, Bak and Bax with bortezomib and arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment. Bortezomib
induces apoptosis in B cell malignancies and is used in the treatment of WM. ATO is not
routinely used in the treatment of WM, and at the concentrations tested, activates apoptosis
18
in a Bim-dependent manner in MM . We observed that Bim was induced by ATO treatment
in BCWM.1 but not MWCL-1 cells (Figure 2F). Bortezomib treatment did not increase
protein expression of Bim, Bax or Bak in these cell lines indicating that the low expression
was not due to increased proteasomal degredation. In contrast the proteasome substrate
Mcl-1 was up-regulated by proteasome inhibition (Figure 2F). The expression of Bcl-2
family members in these WM cell lines indicate distinct mechanisms leading to a common
defect in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway at the point of Bim activation of Bax and Bak.

Given the deficiencies in proteins required to activate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, we
then determined the sensitivity of these cells to agents known to activate this pathway. We
19
first examined sensitivity to the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT-737 . Importantly,
treatment with ABT-737 alone, which relies on the priming of a cell to activate apoptosis,
induced only very low levels of apoptosis in BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells as compared to
the ABT-737-sensitive MM cell line MM.1s (Figure 3A). No detectable apoptosis was
induced by ABT-737 treatment in RPCI-WM1 cells (Figure 3A). We also treated WM cells
19
with ABT-199 which inhibits Bcl-2 alone and observed no sensitivity (Figure 3B).
Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib induced moderate apoptosis in both
BWCM.1 and MWCL-1 cells compared with MM.1s but once again induced no apoptosis in
RPCI-WM1 cells (Figure 3C). Treatment with ATO, which induces mitochondria-dependent
apoptosis at low concentrations, induced moderate levels of apoptosis in BCWM.1 and
MWCL-1 cells and no apoptosis in RPCI-WM1 unless the concentration was increased to
levels of toxicity (Figure 3D). Treatment with Dexamethasone induced no cell death in all
three cell lines (not shown). Interestingly, treatment with bortezomib or ATO alone at a
concentration that induced moderate apoptosis, induced more than additive amounts of

apoptosis with co-treatment with ABT-737 or ABT-199 in both BCWM.1 and MWCL-1
cells yet induced no additional apoptosis in RPCI-WM1 cells (Figure 3E–G). Western blot
analysis of BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cell treated with either bortezomib or ATO displayed no
changes in the expression of Bim, however the BH3 activator protein Bid is cleaved to tBid
(Figure 3H).

Author Manuscript

Since RPCI-WM1 cells were insensitive to agents that induced death in BCWM.1 and
MWCL-1 cells, we treated RPCI-WM1 cells with up to 100 nM bortezomib for 48 hours
and observed cell death (Figure 4A). We then treated the cells with bortezomib in the
presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor BocD-FMK (BocD) in order to determine if this death
was caspase dependent. In BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells the presence of BocD abrogated
approximately 50% of the cell death whereas it was unable to block any cell death induced
by high dose bortezomib in RPCI-WM1 cells (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the annexin-V and
PI staining pattern of both bortezomib treated BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells is indicative of
apoptosis with cells becoming annexin-V positive and then annexin-V and PI double
positive, while the staining pattern for RPCI-WM1 cells treated with bortezomib is not
indicative of apoptosis with cells becoming PI positive and then PI and annexin-V double
positive (Figure 4C–E). Examination of apoptosis-related proteins by western blot indicated
the loss of full length Caspases 3 and 7 and Bid as well as PARP cleavage in BCWM.1 and
MWCL-1 cells but not in RPCI-WM1 cells (Figure 4F). Together these data show BCWM.1
and MWCL-1 cells, though insensitive to agents acting through a Bim-dependent
mechanism such as ABT-737 and Dexamethasone, are capable of undergoing apoptosis with
bortezomib treatment while RPCI-WM1 cells are insensitive to all these agents and are
completely apoptosis deficient.

In order to further investigate the mechanism of dysregulation of Bim, Bax and Bak in the
WM cell lines, we first examined the genomic copy number data available in WM patient
samples and the cell lines. Array-CGH analysis of the RPCI-WM1 cell line, the original
donor patient sample and an age and sex-matched normal donor showed no genomic copy
number variation of either Bak, Bax or Bim (Table S1 and not shown). We then examined a
SNP copy number array of 46 WM patients at the loci for Bak, Bax and Bim. This data set
contained only one copy number gain for each Bak and Bax and no losses in any of the three
genes nor did it show evidence of uniparental disomy in these genes (Table S2). These data
provide no evidence that low expression of Bax, Bak or Bim protein in either the cell lines or
WM patients is due to genomic copy number variation.

Author Manuscript

With no evidence or changes in genomic copy number variation and no evidence of
modulation in protein stability as proteasome inhibition did not cause a recovery of Bim,
Bax or Bak protein in the cell lines (Figure 2F), we then examined mechanisms of
epigenetic regulation of expression. We first examined the methylation state of promoter
CpG islands in Bax, Bak and Bim in BCWM.1, MWCL-1 and RPCI-WM1 cells. PCR
amplification of bisulfite treated samples from all three cell lines yielded only products of
primers targeted to unmethylated DNA and therefore converted promoters (Figure S2A).
Similarly, bisulfite sequencing of Bax and Bim promoters displayed no evidence of
hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of these genes in these WM cell lines
(Figure S2B, C).

We next examined the microRNA expression in these cell lines. We first analyzed the set of
20
seven commonly dysregulated microRNAs in WM for miRs targeting Bim, Bax and Bak
21
and found that only miR-494 had a low probability 7mer site in the 3′ UTR of Bim (Figure
S3A). While it was reported that miR-363* is upregulated in WM, its sister mature
microRNA, miR-363 had two moderately strong target sites in the 3′ UTR of Bim so we
added it to our analysis (Figure S3B). miR-494 was not expressed at higher levels in
MWCL-1 cells than RPCI-WM1 cells and only slightly higher levels in BCWM.1 cells were
detected (Figure 5A). Though miR-363* was undetectable in all three WM cell lines,
miR-363 was expressed at high levels in BCWM.1 and to a lesser degree in both MWCL.1
and RPCI-WM1 (Figure 5B, C). Since the pattern of these two possible Bim targeting
microRNAs did not fit the pattern of Bim expression in the three WM cell lines, we
examined the rest of the commonly upregulated microRNAs (Figure 5D–G) and one
downregulated microRNA (Figure 5H). Only the miR-155 expression pattern was consistent
with suppression of Bim (Figure 5D). None of the set of commonly upregulated microRNAs
had predicted targets in the 3′ UTRs of Bax or Bak (not shown) and none were expressed at
higher levels in RPCI-WM1 than in Bax/Bak expressing cells (Figure 5).

miR-155 has been shown to both directly and indirectly target the transcription factor
21 24
FOXO3a of which Bim is a downstream target (Figure S3C) – . Furthermore, miR-155
has been shown to be important in WM xenograft survival, in addition to being
20
overexpressed in WM patients , 24. We therefore examined the expression of FOXO3a
protein in the WM cell lines, with and without treatment with bortezomib and ATO, and
observed that FOXO3a expression mirrored the Bim expression pattern (Figure 6A, B). To
investigate miR-155 regulation of FOXO3a and Bim we retrovirally transduced RPCI-WM1
cells, which do not overexpress miR-155, with a miR-155 expression construct and observed
greater than 80% reduction in expression of FOXO3a and Bim compared to the vector
backbone (Figure 6C). Having observed miR-155 regulation of FOXO3a and Bim, we then
used a lentiviral vector to stably deliver either an anti-miR targeting miR-155 or a control
anti-miR to the three WM cell lines in order to determine its role in Bim expression control.
In both BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells, along with increased doubling time (data not shown),
we observed an increase in mRNA for FOXO3 and Bim in BWCM.1 and MWCL-1 cells
(Figure 6D, E). While increased FOXO3a protein was observed only in MWCL-1 cells
expressing anti-miR-155 (Figure 6F), incresed Bim protein expression was observed in both
BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells expressing the anti-miR (Figure 6G). Expression of antimiR-155 had no significant effect on expression of other direct activator BH3-only, multidomain effector or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Figure S4A, B). While there was
no increased apoptosis in untreated anti-miR-155 expressing BCWM.1 or RPCI-WM1 cells
there was a small but significant increase in apoptosis in MWCL-1 cells expressing antimiR-155 (Figure 6H). We then treated these cells with ABT-737 and observed an increase in
apoptosis in both BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells in the absence of any other death signal
(Figure 6H). These data demonstrate that increased expression of miR-155 in BCWM.1 and
MWCL-1 cells decreases expression of Bim and its transcription factor FOXO3a abrogating
activation of intrinsic apoptosis.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

All cancer treatment requires a therapeutic index that dictates that the tumor cells will die
before, and in greater numbers than the patient’s healthy tissues. It is sometimes acceptable
to use therapy that targets the normal biology of the tumor as in the case of rituximab
targeting CD20-expressing cells. Since the normal cells that express CD20 are not essential
for life, targeting this biology has limited toxicity. However, most chemotherapeutic agents
target all cells, yet kill cancer cells at lower concentrations than healthy cells. In the case of
8
these treatments, the therapeutic index relies on the concept of mitochondrial priming . This
priming is the load of pro-apoptotic protein being sequestered in a given cell. The more
primed a cell is the less death signaling it needs to cross the apoptotic threshold. On the
whole, cancer cells exhibit higher priming due to breaking proliferative and differentiation
checkpoints. In this study we examined the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins in
Waldenström Macroglobulinemia and its effect on apoptotic threshold.

Author Manuscript

Based on our studies of plasma cell differentiation, we had hypothesized that a disease
harboring the MyD88 (L265P) mutation would have increased expression of Bcl-xL acting
13
as a protective oncogene . At the very outset we observed that this was not the case in WM
as patient gene expression data showed that Bcl-xL expression was at levels similar to
normal tissues (Figure 1). Furthermore, treatment with ABT-737 or ABT-199 did not induce
significant apoptosis in WM cell lines (Figure 2A) which would also suggest that there is not
pro-apoptotic protein being sequestered by either Bcl-xL or Bcl-2. Both in patient expression
data and in BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cells we observed low expression of Bim (Figure 3, 4).
In contrast, the RPCI-WM1 cell line expressed Bim at higher levels yet was deficient in both
Bax and Bak which rendered it apoptosis-deficient in all conditions tested (Figure 3 – 5).
Thus all three cell lines resist apoptosis through loss of pro-apoptotic proteins not
upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. However, both BCWM.1 and
MWCL-1 cells did undergo apoptosis provided that it was Bim-independent. Bortezomib
treatment has been shown to induce Caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid which then
25
synergizes with ABT-737 treatment . We observed a reduction in full length Bid along with
expression of tBid in both bortezomib and ATO treated cells which coincided with increased
sensitivity to co-treatment with ABT-737 and ABT-199 (Figure 3) suggesting induction of
dependence on both Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 for survival. In line with this observation, WM patient
samples displayed Bid expression at levels similar to normal plasma cells and higher than
MM patient samples (Figure 1B, D). However, Bid expressed in WM and normal plasma
cell requires cleavage by Caspase-8 for full activity and thus does not contribute to
mitochondrial priming without treatment.

Author Manuscript

Low levels of mitochondrial priming in WM implies that treatments that require differential
priming for efficacy may not be active against the disease unless priming can be induced. It
has been previsously published that miR-155 antagonism also slows growth of WM cells
24
and leads to xenograft regression . We observed that while antagonizing miR-155 slowed
growth it also induced Bim priming in BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 which increased their
sensitivity to ABT-737 in absence of any other death signal (not shown and Figure 6). We
also observed that inducing cleavage of Bid with proteasome inhibition increased sensitivity
to ABT-737 and ABT-199 suggesting an increase in priming through a tBid-dependent

mechanism (Figure 2). Therefore, though the mitochondria of WM cells may not be primed
with pro-apoptotic protein, there are treatments that can induce priming which in turn
increases their sensitivity to a variety of anti-cancer agents.

Author Manuscript

In Figure 7 we present a model for apoptotic threshold in WM. MM cells express both proand anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins at higher levels than healthy cells (Figure 7A). This sets a
lower apoptotic threshold as it takes less death signaling to induce pro-apoptotic proteins
sufficient to shift the balance and activate Bax and Bak and induce apoptosis (Figure 7B). In
the case of WM, both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins are expressed at low levels similar to
normal plasma cells which sets a higher apoptotic threshold (Figure 7C). Mechanistically
this occurs through the expression of miR-155 which inhibits expression of Bim resulting in
decreased priming. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bid is expressed in WM (Figure 1B, D),
but it requires processing before becoming fully able to activate Bak. This means that more
death signaling is required to cause MOMP and therefore apoptosis in WM. However,
activation of Caspase-8 by bortezomib treatment, or antagonizing miR-155 to relieve
inhibition of Bim lowers the apoptotic threshold which allows activation of apoptosis with
less death signaling (Figure 7C). Finally, the RPCI-WM1 line, which does not conform to
the pattern of WM expression seen in the patient data or the other two cell lines, expresses
Bim at moderate levels but is unable to activate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis as it lacks
Bax and Bak (Figure 7D). Therefore its apoptotic threshold is essentially infinite. Though
the mechanism of Bax and Bak inhibition in these cells remains to be determined, in the case
of Bak, low expression is consistent with patient data (Figure 1B, S1B) and restoring Bak or
Bax expression in these cells should be sufficient to allow for the induction of apoptosis
(Figure 7D).

The current standard of care in WM includes rituximab which targets the B-cell biology of
the WM cell and depends more on complement and immune killer cell-mediated
26
mechanisms than differential mitochondrial priming for action . However, rituximab as a
26
single agent offers no advantage over other single agent treatments in WM patients .
Virtually all WM patients are now treated with some form of combination therapy.
Knowledge of the state of mitochondrial priming in WM can provide direction in choosing
the combination therapies likely to be effective in treatment. Treatment modalities showing
27
promise in WM are those combinations including a proteasome inhibitor . Targeting the
proteasome in WM allows for the induction of mitochondrial priming because of both the
Bcl-2 family expression and the biology of the cell. Proteasome inhibitors attack the WM
cell’s dependency on both the constitutive and immunoproteasome causing both proteotoxic
stress and inhibiting immune functions of the cell in addition to more broadly targeted
28
effects like NF-κB inhibition and cell cycle modulation , 29. The data presented in this
study show that WM cells express pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members at low levels which
makes them less sensitive to apoptosis-inducing agents. However we provide evidence that
mitochondrial priming can be induced in WM by antagonism of miR-155 or cleavage of
Bid, which is expressed in WM. In this way, including agents that are capable of inducing
priming and therefore lowering the apoptotic threshold as part of a combination therapy will
increase the efficacy of a variety of other co-treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene Expression Array Analysis
Normalized (Affymetrix HG-U133A Plus 2.0 Microarray) expression data was obtained
14
from GEO database (GSE6691; PMID: 17252022) for the study . The expression data was
RMA normalized and log2 transformed, to examine the gene expression differences between
B-cell like and plasma-cell like patient groups. Gene expression was calculated as the mean
signal of all available probes for each gene. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 14
BCL-2 genes microarray derived expression was performed to demonstrate the up- and
down- regulated expression differences at the gene level between B-cell like and plasma-cell
like patient samples. Euclidean distance measure with agglomerative average-linkage was
used for clustering row normalized expression data.

Cell Culture
BCWM.1, MWCL-1 and RPCI-WM1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 I.U. penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino acids. Bortezomib was purchased from LC
Laboratories (Woburn, MA). ATO was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
ABT-737 and ABT-199 were generous gifts of Abbvie (North Chicago, IL).
Lentiviral anti-mIR expression
Virus encoding anti-mIR-155 or control Arabidopsis thaliana anti-mIR was purchased from
Sigma Aldrich. WM cell lines were then infected and selected with puromycin.
Transductants were kept in selection during passage and verified by western blot and qRTPCR of downstream targets. Experiments were carried out in the absence of puromycin.

Retroviral miR-155 expression
Virus was prepared using the phoenix cell packaging system and either MG-155 (Addgene

MicroRNA Expression

Author Manuscript

RNA was extracted and enriched for small RNA using the Ambion Mirvanna kit (Life
Technologies AM1561) according to protocol. cDNA was prepared using a specific primer
pool of 8 target microRNAs plus 4 small control RNAs (Applied Biosystems). Realtime
PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (4440040) according to
protocol. Endogenous control CTec was determined by average of the four control small
RNA CT values. RQ was determined by the CT value of the experimental miR normalized
to the endogenous control (ΔCT=CT-CTec) then normalized to the experimental control
(ΔΔCT=ΔCT-ΔCTc) and expressed as the relative quantity (RQ=2−ΔΔCT). Probe and primer
sets: (PN4427975) hsa-mir-9*, hsa-mir-155, hsa-mir-184, hsa-mir-206, hsa-mir-363, hsamir-363*, hsa-mir-494, hsa-mir-542-3p, RNU6B, RNU44, RNU48, U47.
