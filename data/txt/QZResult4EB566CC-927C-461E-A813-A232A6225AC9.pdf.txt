BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence supports the clinical investigation of inhibitors to the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR)
and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) either alone or in combination as treatment for patients with non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-na€ıve, advanced NSCLC who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive carboplatin intravenously at an area under the plasma
drug concentration-time curve of 6.0 plus paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 3 weeks combined with either intravenous cetuximab weekly (arm A), intravenous cixutumumab every 2 weeks (arm B), or both (arm C). Patients who had nonprogessing
disease after 12 weeks of therapy were permitted to continue on maintenance antibody therapy until they developed progressive disease. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The study design required 180 eligible patients and had 88% power
to detect a 60% increase in median PFS for either comparison (arm A vs arm C or arm B vs arm C) using the log-rank test. RESULTS:
From September 2009 to December 2010, 140 patients were accrued. The study was closed to accrual early because of an excessive
number of grade 5 events reported on arms A and C. Thirteen patients died during treatment (6 patients on arm A, 2 patients on arm
B, and 5 patients on arm C), including 9 within approximately 1 month of starting therapy. The estimated median PFS for arms A, B,
and C were similar at 3.4 months, 4.2 months, and 4 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the apparent lack of efficacy and excessive premature deaths, the current results do not support the continued investigation of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and

INTRODUCTION
Molecularly targeted agents are becoming an important component of therapy in the management of some patients with
advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). One of the hallmarks of cancer is the dysregulation of growth signaling
pathways.1 Inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway has been validated in some patients with
advanced NSCLC.2 In 1 phase 3 study, patients with advanced NSCLC who were randomized to receive chemotherapy
with or without cetuximab (a monoclonal antibody to EGFR) demonstrated a modest improvement in survival with the
addition of cetuximab, although this was not sufficient to lead to regulatory approval.3 Another study of carboplatin plus
a taxane with and without cetuximab demonstrated numerically higher overall survival (OS) (P 5 nonsignificant) for the
cetuximab-containing arm.4
In recent years, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) has been studied to understand its role in the development,
pathogenesis, and progression of lung cancer. Signaling through the IGF receptor (IGFR) pathway occurs primarily
through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase

(MAPK) pathway, resulting in increased cell proliferation
and inhibition of apoptosis.5-7 Deregulation of the IGF
pathway appears to result in an increased risk of lung cancer, decreased survival in patients with stage I disease, and
facilitation of malignant transformation.8-11 Synergistic
activity of IGF1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitors and cytotoxic agents has been described, establishing the rationale
for combining IGFR inhibitors with chemotherapy.12 In
addition, the outcomes of nude mice bearing A549
NSCLC tumors that received treatment with the antiIGF-1R antibody h7C10 combined either with chemotherapy or with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab were
superior to the outcomes of mice that received treatment
with either agent alone.12 The rationale for combining
EGFR and IGFR inhibitors is further supported by additional studies that implicated the expression of IGF-1R
with a reduced efficacy of anti-EGFR targeting, including
resistance to gefitinib.13-15 Other pathway activation,
including AKT signaling, has been associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors.16 Combining IGF-1R inhibition with EGFR inhibition may reduce this AKT pathway
activity.16
Monoclonal antibodies, including the fully human
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1 antibody cixutumumab, have
been developed to deregulate the IGF pathway. In vitro,
treatment with cixutumumab induces apoptosis in human
xenograft models and demonstrates increased cytotoxicity
when combined with EGFR inhibition.17 A randomized
phase 2 study comparing patients who received chemotherapy with or without IGFR inhibition originally
reported higher response rates (although the report subsequently was retracted in 2012) for those who received the
anti-IGFR therapy.18 Therefore, based on preclinical and
early clinical information, we conducted the current
randomized phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy of
chemotherapy combined with EGFR inhibition, or IGFR
inhibition, or both in patients with advanced NSCLC
who were not receiving bevacizumab-based therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility

To be eligible, patients must have had a diagnosis of
NSCLC, measurable (defined according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1) stage IV
disease (including M1a and M1b disease according to the
seventh edition of the TNM classification system) or
T4NX (stage IIIB) disease (defined by a nodule in the ipsilateral lung lobe) if they were not a candidate for combined chemotherapy and radiation or surgery. Patients
2254

must have not received prior systemic therapy, including
bevacizumab, anti-EGFR therapy, or anti-IGFR therapy,
for advanced disease. Patients who were receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible if more
than 1 year had passed before randomization to this trial.
All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were not
eligible if they had untreated or symptomatic central nervous system metastases. Patients who had a history of central nervous system metastases that were both definitively
treated and stably controlled were eligible. Patients also
were excluded if they had undergone major surgery within
4 weeks before randomization; if they had a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis; if they had
uncontrolled hypertension or cardiac disease or synchronous malignancy within the last 3 years; if they were considered to be at low risk for a recurrence that had been
treated definitively <3 years before randomization; if
their serum fasting glucose level was >120 mg/dL or
above the institutional upper limit of normal within 2
weeks before randomization; if they had poorly controlled
diabetes mellitus; if they had a history of allergic reactions
attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
composition to cixutumumab; if they had a history of arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, deep venous
thrombosis, or hemorrhagic disorders <28 days before
randomization; or if they had grade >1 peripheral neuropathy according to version 4 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading scale. Within 2
weeks before randomization, a partial thromboplastin
time <1.2 times the upper limit of normal and an international normalized ratio 1.5 were required. Patients were
required to have normal hepatic, renal, and bone marrow
function. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants.
Study Design, Endpoints, and Treatment

This was a multicenter, randomized trial conducted by the
ECOG. The primary objective was to evaluate progressionfree survival (PFS) in patients with NSCLC who were
randomized to receive carboplatin and paclitaxel plus either
cetuximab (arm A), cixutumumab (arm B), or both
(arm C). The secondary objectives included evaluations of
the response rate, the disease control rate (complete
response plus partial response plus stable disease), OS, and
toxicities. Additional secondary objectives included evaluating EGFR by immunohistochemistry (IHC), mutation
and gene copy number, IGF-1R and IGF-2R expression,
and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)
mutation. Plasma-based biomarkers were also evaluated for

total and free IGF-1 and IGF-2 expression and for IGFgrowth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) expression.
The treatment schema for this trial is illustrated in

days). Patients were randomized to receive intravenous
carboplatin at an area under the plasma drug
concentration-time curve (AUC) of 6.0 plus paclitaxel
200 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 22 of each cycle
in combination with either cetuximab 250 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 of each cycle
(Arm A); or cixutumumab 10 mg/kg intravenously on
days 1, 15, and 29 of each cycle (Arm B); or the combination of cetuximab and cixutumumab (Arm C) at the
doses and schedules specified for these therapies on arms
A and B, respectively. The loading dose for patients who
Cancer

received cetuximab was 400 mg/m2 intravenously on day
1 of cycle 1 only. After two 6-week cycles of induction
therapy, patients who had not progressed continued
onto maintenance therapy with either cetuximab, or cixutumumab, or both, corresponding to their randomized
treatment assignment, until they developed either
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Imaging
studies were conducted at baseline and at each 6-week
treatment interval.
Tumor samples were analyzed by IHC (EGFR, IGF1R, and IGF-2R expression), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (EGFR gene copy number), and DNA
sequencing (EGFR, KRAS gene mutations). FISH scores
were interpreted according to Colorado Scoring
Criteria.19

Statistical Considerations

For this 3-arm study, the plan was to randomize 180 eligible and treated patients (200 total patients after 10%
inflation for ineligibility) over 12 months with an 9 additional months of follow-up to compare the combination
of cixutumumab and cetuximab (arm C) with each of the
single agents (arms A and B) without a formal comparison
between the cetuximab-alone arm (arm B) and the
cixutumumab-alone arm (arm C). This design had a yield
of 88% power to detect a 60% increase in median PFS
(5.6 months vs 3.5 months) for either comparison at a
1-sided significance level of 0.10 using the log-rank test.
Full information would be reached at 108 PFS events in
each comparison. There was no plan to compare the
experimental arms with each other.
Safety data on patients and a comparison of toxicity
rates in each arm were collected, and an interim safety
analysis was planned among the first 20 patients who
completed the initial 3 cycles of treatment. Early stopping
rules were defined by 6 or more events of any grade 3 or
greater nonhematologic toxicity, any grade 4 or greater
hematologic toxicity, or grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia or infection with neutropenia.
Archived tissue and serum samples were obtained
from all patients who consented to participate in the exploratory laboratory research studies. Assuming 75% of
patients would participate in the correlative studies and
would have analyzable samples for study, the estimated
sample size for the correlative study was 135 patients. For
the endpoints correlated to cetuximab (EGFR and K-Ras),
we anticipated that the mutation rate for this population
would be 15%. Among the 135 expected samples, 90
patients would have received cetuximab, and 45 would
have been randomized to the cixutumumab-alone arm.
Therefore, 14 of the 90 patients who received cetuximab
were expected to have a mutation. Assuming a 1-sided
type I error rate of 0.10, this sample size provided 81%
power to detect a 100% improvement in median PFS
from 3 months in the mutation-negative group to 6
months in the mutation-positive group among those
patients who received cetuximab. For the endpoints that
correlated specifically to cixutumumab (IGF-1R and
IGF-2R), the anticipated expression rate was assumed to
be 50%. Among the 135 expected samples, 90 patients
would have received cixutumumab. Therefore, 45 of 90
patients who received cixutumumab were expected to
have positive expression levels. Assuming a 1-sided type I
error rate of 0.10, this sample size provided 96% power to
detect a 100% improvement in median PFS from 3
months in the expression-negative group to 6 months in
2256

the expression-positive group among those who received
cixutumumab.
OS was defined as the time from randomization to
the date of death from any cause, with follow-up censored
at the date of last contact. Objective responses were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor,
version 1.1. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of either death or documented disease progression, whichever occurred first. Patients who were alive
at the time of analysis were censored at the date on which
they were last known to be alive and progression-free.
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate eventtime distributions. Cox proportional-hazards models
stratified on sex and histology (squamous vs nonsquamous) were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and to
test for the significance of PFS. PFS and OS were compared using log-rank tests. Adverse events, patient demographics, disease characteristics, and response rates were
compared using Fisher exact tests. All P values are 2-sided,
and confidence intervals (CIs) are at the 95% level. Correlative studies were conducted using similar analysis
methodology.
RESULTS
One-hundred forty patients were accrued from September
11, 2009 through December 17, 2010. The study was
subsequently terminated on April 11, 2011 because of excessive grade 5 events within 30 days of registration. Table
1 summarizes the patient demographics and disease characteristics. There were no substantial differences between
the treatment arms. Most patients were men, white, had
an ECOG performance status of 0, and had experienced
<5% weight loss in the previous 6 months. Similar rates
of squamous and nonsquamous histology were represented. The percentage of patients who received at least 2
cycles (12 weeks) of therapy were 51%, 69%, and 60%
for arms A, B, and C, respectively. The percentage of
patients who received at least 4 cycles (24 weeks) of therapy were 26%, 26%, and 17% for arms A, B, and C,
respectively.
An interim safety analysis was conducted in November 2010 after approximately 20 patients were randomized
to each arm and had completed 3 cycles of treatment. At
that time, the study was accruing more rapidly than anticipated, and a follow-up call was schedule for December
2010 after more toxicity data had been submitted and further analyses conducted. The study was suspended for excessive grade 5 events within 30 days of registration at that
time, on December 17, 2010. A full review of all available
data was then conducted, resulting in termination to

a higher than expected rate of adverse events was observed
on arm C that included deaths for which a treatmentrelated attribution could not be excluded. In addition, there
was a higher than expected rate of early deaths on arm A.
However, a review of those deaths identified that disease,
not treatment-related complications, was the likely cause of
death in most of the patients. Therefore, all patients on arm

C discontinued therapy. All patients on arms A and B were
allowed to continue therapy according to the protocol at
the discretion of the study participant and their treating
physician.
All toxicities, regardless of attribution and including
grade 5 events, are summarized in Table 2. In total, 6
deaths were reported on arm A, 3 were reported on arm B,
and 5 were reported on arm C. Deaths on Arm A were
attributed to asystole in 1 patient, lung infection or respiratory failure in 2 patients, colitis in 1 patient, and unspecified reasons in the other 2 patients. On arm B, 2 deaths
were for unspecified reasons, and 1 death was because of
cancer. On arm C, 3 deaths were attributed to pulmonary
disease (hypoxia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome), and 2 were unspecified. Grade 3 and 4
neutropenia was reported in 29%, 30%, and 42% of
patients in arms A, B, and C, respectively; however, grade
3 and 4 febrile neutropenia was reported in only 7%,
4.5%, and 4.2% of patients in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 hyperglycemia was more common
on the cixutumumab-containing arms (range, 14%-17%)
compared with arm A (2%). In addition, more patients
on arm C experienced grade 3 and 4 hyponatremia
(17%) compared with arms A and B (2% and 4.5%,
respectively).

At the time of data analysis, 111 of 127 eligible and
treated patients had died, and, in total, 123 patients had
experienced a PFS event. The median follow-up for the
patients who were still alive (n 5 18) was 31 months. The
estimated median PFS and corresponding 95% CI for
each treatment arm were 3.4 months (95% CI, 2.6-5.8
months) in arm a, 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.5-5.3 months)
in arm B, and 4 months (95% CI, 3.2-5.4 months) in arm
C (Fig. 2). Patients in arm C did not have improved PFS
compared with patients in arm A (HR, 1.12; 95% CI,
0.71-1.78; P 5 .62) and arm B (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.711.72; P 5 .67). The estimated median OS and corresponding 95% CI for each treatment arm were 9.8
months (95% CI, 7.4-17.2 months) in arm A, 7.7 months
(95% CI, 5.8-11.5 months) in arm B, and 8.8 months
(95% CI, 7.2-14.9 months) in arm C (Fig. 3). The
response rates for arms A, B, and C were 11%, 22%, and
22%, respectively; and the disease control rates were 47%,
63%, and 63%, respectively.
Results of Exploratory Correlative Studies

This study was underpowered to detect differences in subsets defined by biomarker studies. When EGFR was analyzed by FISH, there were 5 failures, whereas 39 patients
tested negative and 30 patients tested positive according
to previously described criteria.20 The median OS for
EGFR-negative and EGFR-positive patients (according to
FISH) was 8.6 months (95% CI, 6.4-12 months) and 9.5

months (95% CI, 6.8-26.7 months), respectively (logrank P 5 .06). There was no difference in PFS between
these 2 groups (log-rank P 5 .18). Similarly, no differences were observed according to whether or not patients
received cetuximab.
For EGFR mutation status, exons 18 through 21
were evaluated, but no mutations were observed except in
5 patients who harbored an exon 19 mutation. No significant differences were observed in their outcomes compared with those who did not have a mutation.
KRAS genotyping was conducted, but the number of
patients tested was too small for statistical analysis. For
KRAS codon 12.34, 72 patients had the GG genotype, 7
had the GT genotype, 1 had the GC genotype, 4 had the
GA genotype, and 1 had the TT genotype. For KRAS
codon 12.35, 8 patients had the GC genotype, 73 had the
GG genotype, 2 had the GA genotype, and 1 had the GT
genotype. For KRAS codon 13.38, 5 patients had the GA
genotype, and 79 had the GG genotype. For KRAS codons 61.182 and 61.183, all patients had the AA genotype. In total, 23 of 85 patients had a mutation in any of
the above-mentioned codons, but comparisons of OS and
PFS were not significant.
IHC studies indicated no significant differences in
comparisons by treatment arm or by group when protein
expression was dichotomized as positive (score, 200)
and negative using the H-score system.21 The median
IGF-1R score was 190 (range, 30-390), the median
IGF-2R score was 145 (range, 20-350), the median

EGFR membrane and cytoplasm H score was 190 (range,

160 (range, 0-390).
DISCUSSION
Results from this randomized, open-label, multi-institutional, phase 2 study do not support continued evaluation
of cixutumumab in combination with carboplatin plus
paclitaxel with or without cetuximab in the patient population studied. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating improved PFS with the
cixutumumab-containing regimens compared with the
carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus cetuximab regimen.
Although response rates and disease control rates trended
higher with the 2 cixutumumab-containing arms compared with the carboplatin/paclitaxel/cetuximab arm, neither PFS nor OS appeared to be superior in the
cixutumumab-containing arms. Patient characteristics
were similar between 3 arms with the exception of more
active smokers in the cetuximab plus cixutumumabcontaining arm. Disease characteristics also were similar
between each arm. A few differences in toxicity were noted
between the arms. More grade 3 hyponatremia was
observed in the cetuximab plus cixutumumab-containing
arm; and, as expected, more grade 3 and 4 hyperglycemia
was reported in the cixutumumab-containing arms.
Although more grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was reported
on the cetuximab-cixutumumab–containing arm, there
was no difference in febrile neutropenia or infection rates
among the arms.
The trial was closed before planned accrual goals
because of concerns about excessive grade 5 events
reported for arms A and C. A detailed analysis of each
death did not demonstrate a clear pattern of causality. Excessive grade 5 events had not been reported previously in
larger phase 3 trials of chemotherapy with cetuximab,
including in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.3,4 Although excessive grade 5 events were not
reported on arm B, accrual was halted based on a consensus opinion of the leaders of the study, including ECOG
members as well as members of National Cancer Institute/Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Reasons for
this decision included the recently reported negative phase
3 study with figitumumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting IGF-1R), which failed to confirm the promising
results reported in the randomized phase 2 study.22 Our
study was designed before publication of the results from
the phase 3 trial with figitumumab.22 In that trial, the
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended
early closure because of futility and also because of

excessive toxicity, including 5% grade 5 events in the figitumumab arm.
Biomarker studies are an integral component of trials assessing molecularly targeted therapy. Although unselected patient populations may not benefit from a given
targeted therapy, correlation of outcomes with molecular
targets may identify a subpopulation of patients likely to
benefit. The best examples to date in NSCLC include the
identification of EGFR mutations that predict response to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and ALK gene rearrangements that predict response to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors.23-25 Unfortunately, biomarker studies (which were
exploratory and presumably compromised further because
of early study closure) in the current trial did not provide
additional insights into subgroups of patients who may
benefit from cixutumumab-containing regimens.
In vitro and in vivo studies have supported the clinical testing of combination studies of IGF-1R and EGFR
dual inhibition.11,12 Results from a phase 1/2 study of
erlotinib in combination with cixutumumab for patients
with advanced NSCLC (most had received 1 or more
prior regimens) was reported by Weickhardt et al in
2012.26 In that trial, patients were treated in a doseescalation manner (3 1 3 design). The most frequent
adverse events were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, anorexia, and
nausea. Of 18 patients who were evaluated, 5 achieved stable disease, including 1 patient who had stable disease for
>14 months. There appeared to be little activity in an
unselected patient population that had wild-type EGFR.
Biomarker analysis on that small study demonstrated a
trend toward benefit in PFS for patients who had the
highest quartile of baseline free IGF-1 levels.
In the first-line setting, Karp et al initially reported
promising results from a randomized phase 2 study of
carboplatin plus paclitaxel with or without figitumumab
(an antibody to IGFR).18 Since their initial report,
results from the study were published in 2009 but subsequently were retracted in 2012, when the sponsor
learned that the overall response rate and PFS data were
incorrect.27,28 In addition, a phase 3 study of figitumumab in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel in a
nonadenocarcinoma patient population failed to demonstrate increased efficacy with the addition of figitumumab.22 In that trial, 681 patients were enrolled, most of
whom had squamous cell cancer (86%). The HR crossed
the prespecified futility boundary of 1.1 favoring paclitaxel and carboplatin alone. In those with low baseline
IGF levels, safety, tolerability, and survival appeared to
be worse with the addition of figitumumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel.

Original Article

In conclusion, treatment with cixutumumab in
combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel with or
without cetuximab does not appear to improve PFS or OS
in the unselected patient population tested in our study.
Prior studies, as detailed above, hypothesized that the level
of circulating IGF levels may impact therapies that block
IGFR activity. Future studies, if any are to be conducted
in NSCLC, should be conducted only if a biomarker,
such as high circulating IGF levels, is used to select potentially responsive patients.
