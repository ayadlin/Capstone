ABSTRACT
Twist, a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), plays an
important role in the development of a tumorigenic phenotype. Energy metabolism
reprogramming (EMR), a newly discovered hallmark of cancer cells, potentiates
cancer cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Currently little is known about the
effects of Twist on tumor EMR. In this study, we found that glucose consumption and
lactate production were increased and mitochondrial mass was decreased in Twistoverexpressing MCF10A mammary epithelial cells compared with vector-expressing
MCF10A cells. Moreover, these Twist-induced phenotypic changes were augmented
by hypoxia. The expression of some glucose metabolism-related genes such as
PKM2, LDHA, and G6PD was also found to be upregulated. Mechanistically, activated
β1-integrin/FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR and suppressed P53 signaling were responsible for
the observed EMR. Knockdown of Twist reversed the effects of Twist on EMR in Twistoverexpressing MCF10A cells and Twist-positive breast cancer cells. Furthermore,
blockage of the β1-integrin/FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by siRNA or specific
chemical inhibitors, or rescue of p53 activation can partially reverse the switch of
glucose metabolism and inhibit the migration of Twist-overexpressing MCF10A cells
and Twist-positive breast cancer cells. Thus, our data suggest that Twist promotes
reprogramming of glucose metabolism in MCF10A-Twist cells and Twist-positive
breast cancer cells via activation of the β1-integrin/FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
and inhibition of the p53 pathway. Our study provides new insight into EMR.

Altered energy metabolism is now defined as a hallmark
of cancer [2–4]. The  metabolic switch, or energy
metabolism reprogramming (EMR), has attracted much
attention recently, as evidenced by many reviews on
this topic [5–7]. Hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase
2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) were
reported to regulate EMR. HK2 catalyzes the essentially
irreversible first step of glycolysis by phosphorylating

INTRODUCTION
Most cancer cells tend to utilize aerobic glycolysis
to produce energy instead of oxidative phosphorylation
even in the presence of abundant oxygen. This
phenomenon was first described by Otto Warburg and
termed as Warburg effect [1]. Subsequently Warburg
effect has been proven to exist widely in various tumors.

glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. PKM2 is the key
regulator at the rate-limiting final step of glycolysis
by converting phosphoenolpyruvic acid into pyruvate
acid. LDHA catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate
and lactate. It has been shown that abnormal expression
of these enzymes could contribute to promote Warburg
effect in cancer cells [8–11]. Cancer cells reprogram
their metabolism to facilitate fast proliferation through
increased glycolysis and biosynthetic activities. EMR is
essential to the survival of cancer cells and can increase
the proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells
[12–15]. To date, the key molecular mechanisms for
EMR regulation and its role in cancer development still
remain elusive.
Twist, a highly conserved basic Helix-Loop-Helix
transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of
various physiological and pathological processes such
as organ development, cell proliferation, differentiation,
and tumorigenesis. Twist is known to function as a major
regulator in EMT and thereby promotes tumor invasion
and metastasis [16–18]. Studies have increasingly
demonstrated that Twist plays an important role in tumor
development. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear
whether Twist regulates EMR.
Our cDNA microarray and proteomics analysis
indicated that the expression of some glucose
metabolism-related genes in Twist-overexpressing
MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells (defined
here MCF10A-Twist) was changed (data unpublished).
We have reported that Twist induces EMT and promotes
migration and invasion in MCF10A-Twist [19]. In this
study, the effects of Twist on EMR of MCF10A-Twist
were explored. We detected EMR-related phenotypes
such as changes in glucose consumption, lactate
production, and mitochondrial mass in MCF10ATwist compared with MCF10A-Vector under normoxic
and hypoxic conditions, respectively. Our results
demonstrate that Twist can induce EMR in MCF10ATwist cells. The β1-integrin/FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR
and p53 signaling pathways are important mediators for
the process. These data may advance our understanding
of tumor development and provide new strategies for
prevention and treatment of breast cancer.

Hypoxic treatment could increase glucose consumption
of MCF10A-Twist cells compared with MCF10A-Vector
cells (Fig. 1A).
To examine whether the glycolysis was altered by
Twist, lactate production was detected using Lactate Assay
Kit. As shown in Fig. 1B, MCF10A-Twist cells produced
more lactate than MCF10A-Vector cells under normoxic or
hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic treatment further increased
lactate generation in MCF10A-Twist cells compared with
MCF10A-Vector cells.
Mito-Tracker Green, a fluorescent probe of
mitochondria, was used to study the effect of Twist on
mitochondrial mass in MCF10A cells. Compared with
MCF10A-Vector cells, MCF10A-Twist cells presented
weaker fluorescence intensity, suggesting these cells had
lower mitochondrial mass than control cells. Moreover,
mitochondrial mass of MCF10A-Twist was further
reduced under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1C) in contrast to
MCF10A-Vector cells.
To further investigate mitochondrial function, the
number and morphology of mitochondria were observed
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). There were
fewer mitochondria observed in the MCF10A-Twist cells
(Fig. 1D, b1) compared with that in MCF10A-Vector cells
(Fig. 1D, a1) under normoxic conditions. The number of
mitochondria in both MCF10A-Vector and -Twist cells was
gradually reduced with the increasing hypoxic exposure
time, and less mitochondria were in MCF10A-Twist
cells (Fig.  1D, b2–b5) than in MCF10A-Vector cells
(Fig. 1D, a2–a5). Moreover, the longitudinal mitochondrial
crest (Fig. 1D, b3) and swollen mitochondria (Fig. 1D, b4)
could be seen in MCF10A-Twist but not in control cells
after hypoxia exposure.

Loss of Twist expression partly reverses the
switch of energy metabolism
To further study the role of Twist in regulating
EMR, we tested whether Twist silence in MCF10A-Twist
and Twist-positive breast cancer cells could reverse
the energy metabolic phenotype. Using a lentivirus
vector expressing human Twist shRNA, Twist-silenced
MCF10A-Twist (MCF10A-Twist-sh-Twist) and BT549
(BT549-sh-Twist) cells were successfully established
(Supplemental Fig. 1A–1D). Knockdown of Twist in
MCF10A-Twist (MCF10A-Twist-sh-Twist) decreased
glucose consumption and lactate production compared
with control cells (MCF10A-Twist-sh-Ctrl) (Fig. 2A–2B).
Hypoxic exposure rendered MCF10A-Twist cells
(MCF10A-Twist-sh-Ctrl) to consume more glucose and
produce more lactate than Twist-silenced MCF10ATwist cells (MCF10A-Twist-sh-Twist) (Fig.  2A–2B).
This was further confirmed in BT549-sh-Twist cells
(Supplemental Fig. 1E–1F). The mitochondrial mass was
partly increased in MCF10A-Twist-sh-Twist and BT549sh-Twist (Fig. 2C and Supplemental Fig. 1G).

RESULTS
Twist invokes the altered energy metabolic
phenotype in MCF10A-Twist cells
After MCF10A-Vector and MCF10A-Twist
cells were incubated with 21% O2 or 1% O2 for 1, 3, 6
and 12 h, the effect of Twist on glucose consumption
was investigated. The increased glucose consumption
was detected by using Glucose Assay Kit in MCF10ATwist cells compared with MCF10A-Vector cells under
normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions.

Expression of energy metabolism-associated
genes is regulated by Twist in MCF10A-Twist
and Twist-positive breast cancer cells

(Fig. 3D) and BT549 (Supplemental Fig.  2B)
were increased under hypoxic conditions. In addition,
Twist knockdown led to decreased G6PD, PKM2,
LDHA, p-AKT and elevated p53 in MCF10A-Twist-shTwist and BT549-sh-Twist as expected (Fig. 3E and
Supplemental Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that PI3K/
AKT and p53 signaling may be involved in the Twistdriven EMR.

To understand the molecular mechanism of Twistdriven EMR, we analyzed our cDNA microarray and
proteomic data of MCF10A-Twist and MCF10A-Vector
cells. Indeed, a set of energy metabolism-associated
genes were dysregulated in MCF10A-Twist compared
with MCF10A-Vector (Fig. 3A). Some of these genes
were validated using qRT-PCR analysis. It was found
that G6PD, PKM2, LDHA, PGK1, ENO1 and TPI1 were
up-regulated in MCF10A-Twist (Fig. 3B). Expression
of PKM2, LDHA and G6PD, which are critical genes
linked to energy metabolism, was further confirmed
by western blotting (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the level of
p-AKT was up-regulated, while p53 was down-regulated
in MCF10A-Twist (Fig.  3C). These two genes were
reported to be related with energy metabolic switch
[20, 21]. Levels of p-AKT and p53 in Twist-positive
BT549 cells were higher than those in MCF10A
cells (Supplemental Fig. 2A). Interestingly, levels of
G6PD, PKM2, LDHA and p-AKT in MCF10A-Twist

mTOR signaling and inhibition of p53 signaling
To explore the role of PI3K/AKT and p53 in
Twist-induced EMR, the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002,
was used to treat MCF10A-Twist and BT549 cells.
As expected, glucose consumption and lactate production
in MCF10A-Twist (Fig. 4A–4B) and BT549 cells
(Supplemental  Fig.  3A–3B) were decreased, whereas
mitochondrial mass was increased (Fig. 4C and
Supplemental Fig. 3C).
In addition, expression of PKM2 and LDHA in
MCF10A-Twist and BT549 cells was down-regulated
by LY294002 (Fig. 4D and Supplemental Fig. 3D). Of

note, there were no changes of p53 and G6PD expression
after LY294002 treatment. PKM2 has been identified to
be a target gene of mTOR [22], a downstream effector
in the PI3K/AKT pathway [23, 24]. Silencing mTOR
with siRNA decreased PKM2 and LDHA protein levels
in MCF10A-Twist and BT549 (Fig. 4E and Supplemental
Fig.  3E), suggesting that PI3K/AKT/mTOR regulates
PKM2 and LDHA expression in MCF10A-Twist
and BT549. Moreover, glucose consumption and
lactate production in MCF10A-Twist/mTOR siRNA
(Supplemental Fig. 4A–4B) and BT549/mTOR siRNA
(Supplemental Fig. 4C–4D) were also decreased compared
to their control cells.
It was demonstrated that loss of p53 function
might activate the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and
contribute to Warburg effect [25]. Indeed, p53 (which
is wild type in MCF10A [26]) was down-regulated,
whereas the key rate-limiting enzyme of PPP G6PD
was upregulated, in MCF10A-Twist (Fig. 3C). To
confirm the negative correlation between p53 and
G6PD in MCF10A-Twist, the wild-type p53 gene was
transfected into MCF10A-Twist. As expected, restoration
of p53 expression in MCF10A-Twist suppressed
G6PD expression (Fig. 4F). To extend this finding, the
endogenous p53 and G6PD in the representative breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 (Twist-low level) and BT549
(Twist-high level) were detected. Low levels of wildtype p53 [27] and high levels of G6PD were detected
in MCF-7, and high levels of mutant p53 [28] and low
levels of G6PD were identified in BT549. However, mild
levels of p53 and G6PD were in MCF10A (Supplemental
Fig. 3F). Unlike wild-type p53, the p53 mutants (e.g.
R175H, R273H, and G279E) were shown to possess
minimal or no activity in inhibiting G6PD [25].
Therefore, there were no obvious changes in the level of
G6PD expression in BT549 after knockdown of p53 with
siRNA (Supplemental Fig. 3G). To further investigate
the role of p53 in modulating G6PD, the wild-type p53
was stably transfected into BT549. Consistent with our
expectation, G6PD expression was partly repressed by
wild-type p53 in BT549/p53 (Supplemental Fig. 3H).
Our  data indicate that Twist might increase G6PD by
repressing wild-type p53, thus promoting PPP.
Moreover, it has been indicated that the mTOR
pathway is negatively regulated by the p53 tumor
suppressor [29, 30]. Consistent with this, our data
show that restoration of wild-type p53 expression in
MCF10A-Twist (Fig. 4F) and Twist-positive BT549 cells
(Supplemental Fig. 3H) inhibited mTOR expression.
Subsequently, the EMR biomarker of glucose
consumption and lactate production in MCF10A-Twist/
p53 and BT549/p53 were determined. As expected,
glucose consumption and lactate production in
MCF10A-Twist/p53 (Supplemental Fig. 5A–5B) and
BT549/p53 (Supplemental Fig. 5C–5D) were decreased.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

These data suggest that wild-type p53 exerts negative
regulation of mTOR pathway, however, Twist relieves
this inhibition by repressing wild-type p53, and thus
promotes glycolysis.

β1-integrin/FAK signaling is responsible for the
activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis
and thus promotes EMR
β1-integrin is known to activate FAK in both
normal and transformed cells [31, 32]. β1-integrin
level was found to be more than 3 times higher in
MCF10A-Twist cells compared with MCF10A-Vector
cells according to our proteomic analysis (Data not
shown). Indeed, using western blotting, high levels
of β1-integrin and phosphorylated FAK (p-FAK)
were detected in MCF10A-Twist cells (Fig. 5A) and
Twist-positive BT549 cells (Supplemental Fig. 6A).
Knockdown of Twist in MCF10A-Twist and BT549
cells decreased the levels of β1-integrin and p-FAK
in MCF10A-Twist-sh-Twist and BT549-sh-Twist
cells (Fig. 5B and Supplemental Fig. 6B). To further
investigate whether β1-integrin/FAK signaling pathway
is implicated in promoting EMR, the expression
of the EMR-associated PKM2 and LDHA, and the
EMR biomarker of glucose consumption and lactate
production were determined. Silence of β1-integrin
in MCF10A-Twist and BT549 cells resulted in
down-regulation of p-FAK, p-AKT, PKM2 and LDHA.
p53 and G6PD expression did not show significant
changes (Fig. 5C and Supplemental Fig. 6C). After PF562271 (an inhibitor of FAK) treatment, the expression
of p-FAK, p-AKT, PKM2 and LDHA, but not p53 and
G6PD was decreased in MCF10A-Twist (Fig. 5D) and
BT549 cells (Supplemental Fig. 6D). Correspondingly,
glucose consumption and lactate production in
MCF10A-Twist
(Supplemental
Fig.  7A–7B)
and BT549 (Supplemental  Fig. 7D–7E) were also
decreased. Mitochondrial mass in MCF10A-Twist and
BT549 treated with PF-562271 was higher than that
in their control cells (Supplemental Fig. 7C and 7F).
These data suggest that Twist activates β1-integrin/
FAK signaling pathway and its downstream PI3K/AKT
signaling in MCF10A-Twist and BT549 cells, and thus
promotes EMR of these cells.

Twist directly represses the transcription of p53
Previous study has demonstrated that Twist can
bind to the E-box of p53 to repress gene transcription
of p53 [33]. To verify this repression of p53 in
Twist-positive cells, luciferase assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays were conducted. As shown
in Fig. 6A, after transient transfection of p53-Luc,
mut-p53-Luc and Twist in HEK293T cells, ectopic

EMR in MCF10A-Twist and Twist-positive
breast cancer cells enhances cell migration

expression of Twist dramatically inhibited p53 promoter
activity. In contrast, Twist did not affect the activity of
E-box mutant p53 promoter. This was further confirmed
by transfection of p53-Luc or mutant p53-Luc into
MCF10A-Twist, Twist-positive BT549 and their Twistsilenced cells. Knockdown of Twist in MCF10A-Twist
and BT549 cells significantly increased the activity of
p53 promoter but not the E-box mutant p53 promoter
(Fig. 6B). Binding of Twist to the p53 promoter was
clearly detected in MCF10A-Twist cells and BT549
cells (Fig. 6C). Overall, these results demonstrate that
Twist inhibits p53 expression by binding to the E-box
of p53.

Finally, we asked whether EMR could lead to
enhanced cell migration ability. Compared with MCF10AVector, MCF10A-Twist showed stronger migratory
capacity (Fig. 7A, left upper). After treatment with PF562271 or LY294002 (Fig. 7A, left down) or restoration
of p53 expression in MCF10A-Twist (Fig. 7B), cell
migration ability was reduced. Similar findings were
confirmed in BT549 cells (Fig. 7C–7D). Specially, silence
of endogenous mutant p53 in BT549 using its siRNA or
overexpression of wild-type p53 in BT549, cell migration

antibody.

was notably decreased. Thus, blockage of β1-integrin/FAKPI3K/AKT signaling or rescue of functional p53 expression
in MCF10A-Twist and Twist-positive BT549 cells inhibits
EMR and impedes cell migration. Taken together, these
data suggest a close association between EMR induced by
Twist and cancer cells’ ability of migration and metastasis.

MCF10A-Twist (unpublished data). PI3K/AKT pathway
is closely related to glucose metabolism and cell invasion
in tumor. Activation of PI3K/AKT signaling resulted in an
enhanced anaerobic glycolysis [47]. AKT may constitute a
“Warburg kinase”, as AKT hyper-activation increases tumor
cells glucose uptake and glycolysis [20].
In the past few years, it became clear that the
tumor suppressor p53 can also directly control metabolic
traits of cells. p53 plays a role in promoting oxidative
phosphorylation and inhibiting glycolysis [21, 48, 49].
Moreover, the p53 protein binds to G6PD and prevents the
formation of the active dimer, thus inhibiting the PPP [25].
Consistently, p53 inactivation in tumor cells likely
accelerates glucose consumption via activation of the
PPP and glycolysis. Therefore we suppose that PI3K/
AKT and p53 signaling pathways may be responsible for
EMR induced by Twist in MCF10A-Twist cells and Twistpositive breast cancer cells.
Our data has demonstrated that Twist can activate
FAK and its downstream PI3K/AKT pathway through
upregulating the expression of β1-integrin. In order to
demonstrate our hypothesis, β1-integrin/FAK/PI3K/
AKT pathway was blocked using a chemical inhibitor or
RNAi interference. Our results indicated that blockage
of β1-integrin/FAK-PI3K/AKT pathway partly reversed
the phenotype of EMR induced by Twist and reduced the
expression of PKM2 and LDHA in MCF10A-Twist and
BT549. Overall, these findings suggest that β1-integrin/
FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in EMR induced by
Twist in MCF10A-Twist and Twist-positive breast cancer
cells. To further uncover the molecular mechanism of
how PKM2 was regulated by PI3K/AKT pathway, mTOR
specific siRNA was used to inhibit mTOR expression.
mTOR, a downstream effector of AKT, has been identified
as a central activator of Warburg effect by inducing
PKM2 and other glycolytic enzymes under normoxic
conditions [22]. We found that PKM2 and LDHA were
down regulated and glucose consumption and lactate
production were decreased after transfected with mTOR
siRNA. These results suggest that β1-integrin/FAK/
PI3K/AKT pathway upregulates PKM2 through mTOR
in MCF10A-Twist and Twist-positive breast cancer cells.
Besides, glucose consumption and lactate production
were decreased, and mitochondrial mass was increased
in MCF10A-Twist and BT549 cells treated with FAK
inhibitor. Taken together, Twist promotes glycolysis via
activation of β1-integrin-FAK-PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis in
MCF10A-Twist and BT549 cells. Furthermore, previous
studies have proved that Twist directly interacts with
the DNA binding domain of p53 to suppress its DNAbinding and transcriptional activity and Twist may affect
p53 protein level indirectly through modulation of the
ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway [50]. Moreover, Twist also
enhances MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 through
an E-box-independent mechanism. Twist binds p53 C
terminus through the Twist box and the interaction is

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated whether EMR is
regulated by Twist in MCF10A-Twist and Twist-positive
breast cancer cells. We found that the expression of Twist
resulted in an altered energy metabolic phenotype of
MCF10A-Twist and Twist-positive breast cancer BT549
cells. Compared with MCF10A-Vector, MCF10A-Twist
consumed more glucose, produced more lactate and had
lower mitochondrial mass. Furthermore, hypoxia treatment
potentiated these changes. Consistent with these findings,
our data suggest that loss of Twist expression reversed the
altered energy metabolic phenotype of MCF10A-Twist
and BT549 cells. Our data strongly indicate that Twist is
capable of triggering EMR in breast cancer cells.
Using cDNA microarray and proteomics analysis,
we found that there was altered expression of a set of
glucose metabolism-related genes in MCF10A-Twist cells
compared to that in its control cells. The mRNA expression
of G6PD, PKM2, LDHA, PGK1, ENO1 and TPI1 was
increased in MCF10A-Twist. Protein expression of PKM2,
LDHA and G6PD, key genes related to EMR, was further
confirmed in MCF10A-Twist. Moreover, silencing Twist
by RNA interference diminished the expression of PKM2,
LDHA and G6PD in MCF10A-Twist and BT549. PKM2,
the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PK), is expressed in
highly proliferating cells, including in all cancer cell lines
and tumors studied to date [34, 35]. Previous researches
have shown that PKM2 expression is essential for aerobic
glycolysis of cancer cells and tumor growth [36–38].
Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have implicated that
high expression of PKM2 promotes Warburg effect and
provides a selective growth advantage for tumor cells [36].
LDHA, which executes the final step of aerobic lactate
production, is elevated in many human cancers and has been
linked to tumor growth, maintenance, and invasion [39–42].
Expression of LDHA can be affected by PKM2, GLUT1 and
LDHA. PKM2 is essential for the EGFR induced Warburg
effect [43]. G6PD is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of
PPP [44] and plays a critical role in tumorigenesis [45, 46].
The activity of G6PD is negatively regulated by p53, which
can block the formation of active dimers of G6PD [25].
Our data suggest that the overexpression of Twist in breast
cancer cells may result in EMR through up-regulating of
PKM2, LDHA, and G6PD. In addition, we also found that
p-AKT was increased and p53 was repressed by Twist in
MCF10A-Twist. Our previous studies have demonstrated
that a set of multiple canonical signal pathways including
PI3K/AKT and p53 signaling pathways are altered in

critical for Twist inhibition of p53 [51]. Interestingly,
our results indicate that overexpression of Twist in
MCF10A cells results in down-regulation of wild-type
p53, which relieves the inhibition effect of wild-type
p53 on G6PD and leads to up-regulation of G6PD. We
subsequently demonstrated that Twist can directly inhibit
the expression of p53 by binding to the E-box of human
p53 gene promoter, which was consistent with previous
studies [33]. We further demonstrated that overexpression
of wild-type p53 in MCF10A-Twist decreased the
expression of G6PD. Nevertheless, BT549 expresses
high level of mutant p53 (R249S) [28] and it has little
influence on G6PD expression. Overexpression of wildtype p53 decreased the G6PD expression in BT549.
Our data further proved that p53 inactivation caused
by mutation made it lose the ability to regulate G6PD.
In addition, we found that overexpression of wild-type
p53 inhibited the mTOR expression and decreased the
glucose consumption and lactate production in MCF10ATwist and BT549. These results suggest that Twist
also relieves the inhibition of wild-type p53 on mTOR
pahway and thus promotes glycolysis. The alterations
in energy metabolism could sustain the growth of
breast cancer cells and promote the migration of breast
cancer cell by providing energy for cells. In summary,
our findings suggest that Twist may activate PPP and
glycolysis pathway by down-regulating wild-type p53 or
inactivating of wild-type p53, thereby promoting EMR
and contributing to Warburg effect in MCF10A-Twist and
Twist-positive breast cancer cells.
To our knowledge, this is the first time to study the
effect of Twist on EMR in breast cancer cells. Our results
indicate that Twist can induce EMR and cell migration
by activating the β1-integrin/FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway and repressing the p53 pathway in MCF10ATwist cells and Twist-positive breast cancer cells.
In conclusion, this study sheds light on the
mechanisms of EMR regulation in breast cancer cells and
provides new avenues for breast cancer treatment.

LDHA, G6PD, mTOR and p-FAK (Y397) were obtained
from Bioworld (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). Antibody
against β1-integrin was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).
Antibodies against PKM2, p-AKT (S473), and p53
were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA,
USA). β-actin antibody, goat antimouse IgG-HRP, and
goat antirabbit IgG-HRP were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The retroviral
expression vectors encoding c-Myc-tagged Twist
was described previously [19]. pCMV-HA-p53 was
constructed by inserting human p53 cDNA into pCMVHA (Clontech, PaloAlto, CA, USA). The p53 promoter
(−291 to +71 region) was inserted into the pGL3-basic
vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at KpnI/XbaI
sites to construct pGL3-p53 luciferase reporter plasmid.
The E-box site of the p53 promoter was mutated (from
5′-CAGCTG-3′ to 5′-TGGCTG-3′) using the QuikChange
Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA),
and then the E-box site-mutated p53 promoter was cloned
into the pGL3-basic vector (named as pGL3-mut p53
luciferase reporter here after). All constructs were verified
by sequencing.
The immortalized normal human mammary
epithelial cell line MCF10A, human breast cancer cell
lines MCF7 and BT549, and HEK293T were obtained
from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). MCF10A-Vector
and MCF10A-Twist cells were established as previously
described [19]. MCF10A, MCF10A-Vector, and MCF10ATwist were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium. MCF7
and BT549 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS. Hypoxia treatment of cells
was performed in a tri-gas incubator (Thermo,  USA)
flushed with a gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2 and 94%
nitrogen. For chemical treatment, cells were cultured in
12-well plates for 24 h. Then the cultured medium was
replaced by fresh medium containing 50 μM LY294002
or vehicle for 6 h, or by fresh medium containing 10 μM
PF-562271 or vehicle for 24 h.

Luciferase assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For the luciferase reporter assay, HEK293T
cells were co-transfected with pGL3-Luc, pGL3-p53Luc, or pGL3-mut p53-Luc and Twist construct or its
control vector. MCF10A-Twist and BT549 cells were
transfected with pGL3-Luc, pGL3-p53-Luc, or pGL3mut p53-Luc and Twist shRNA or its control shRNA
using LipofectamineTM 2000. The Renilla luciferase was
as internal control. After transfection, cells were incubated
for 30 h (293T cells) or 60 h (MCF10A-Twist and BT549
cells) and luciferase activity was examined by using the
luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
The relative firefly luciferase activity was calculated
by normalizing transfection efficiency according to the
Renilla luciferase activity.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR

For detection of glucose, lactate concentration,
cells were seeded in 12-well plates at appropriate
concentrations. When cell confluence was 60%–70%, the
culture medium was replaced by fresh growth medium.
After different treatment, the supernatant of culture
medium was collected for measurement of glucose
and lactate concentrations. The levels of glucose were
determined using the Glucose Assay Kit and the levels of
lactate were determined using the Lactate Assay Kit under
microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, Vermont, USA)
according to their respective manufacturer’s protocols.
At the same time, the number of cells in each well was
counted. Glucose consumption and lactate production
were normalized to cell number, respectively.

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent
according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
as described previously [52]. The primers are listed in
Supplemental Table 1.

RNA interference
The lentivirus vector containing a cytomegalovirus
(CMV)-driven GFP reporter and a U6 promoter
upstream of the cloning sites (Age I and EcoR I) was
used for cloning small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). The
lentiviral expression vector of Twist1 shRNA and its
infective lentivirus were obtained from GenePharma
(Shanghai, China). The target sequence for Twist1 is
5′-AAGCTGAGCAAGATTCAGACC-3′. The  lentiviral
expression vector of β1-integrin shRNA and its infective
lentivirus were obtained from GeneChem (Shanghai,
China). The target sequences for β1-integrin are
5′-CCGGGAGGAAATGGTGTTTGCAAGTTTCAAGAG
AACTTGCAAACACCATTTCCTCTTTTTG-3′ (forward),
3′-CTCCTTTACCACAAACGTTCAAAGTTCTCTTGAA
CGTTTGT
GGTAAAGGAGAAAAACTTAA-5′
(reverse). The control shRNA sequence is 5′-TTCTCCGAA
CGTGTCACGT-3′. Cell infection with lentivirus was
carried out for 12 h, and then the culture medium was
replaced by fresh growth medium. The efficiency of gene
knockdown was determined by qRT-PCR and western
blotting analysis.
The mTOR or p53 siRNA (Ribobio, Guangzhou,
China) was transiently transfected into cells
using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA., USA) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. The target sequences for mTOR siRNA
are
5′-GGAGUCUACUCGCUUCUAUTT-3′
(A)
and
5′-AUAGAAGCGAGUAGACUCCTC-3′
(B). The target sequences for p53 siRNA are
5′-AAGAAA
TTTGCGTTTGGAGTA-3′
(A),
and
5′-AAGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAAT-3′
(B).
The control siRNA sequence is 5′-AAGG
TGTCAGAAACTGACGAT-3′.

Mitochondrial detection by TEM
MCF10A-Twist and MCF10A-Vector cells were
cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for the
indicated time. Cells were then harvested and fixed in
glutaraldehyde for 2 h, followed by 1% osmium tetroxide
for 2 h at 4°C. After being dehydrated in ethanol and
acetone, the cells were embedded in epoxy resin and
polymerized at 60°C. Ultrathin sections with the thickness
of 60 nm were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate
and lead citrate. Slides were observed under TEM
(Hitachi-7500, Japan) and photographed using a CCD
camera (Gatan-780CCD, USA).

Western blotting analysis
Western blotting was performed as described
previously [53]. The specific primary antibodies used
in this study were PKM2 (1:1000), LDHA (1:2000),
G6PD (1:1000), p-AKT (1:1000), mTOR (1:1000),
p-FAK (1:500), β1-integrin (1:1000), Twist (1:100) and
p53 (1:500). The appropriate HRP-labeled secondary
antibodies were subsequently applied and signals were
then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents
(ECL, Millipore, MA, USA).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were
performed as previously described [54] and anti-c-Myc
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA)
or anti-Twist antibody (Abcam Cambridge, UK) was used
to precipitate the protein/DNA complex. DNA fragments
were extracted and amplified by PCR. The human
p53 promoter-specific primers used in PCR were 5′CATTTTAACTGATGAGAAGAAAGGA-3′ (forward),
5′-GGACAGTCGCCATGACAAG-3′ (reverse). Input
DNA was analyzed in parallel in order to normalize the
results.

Detection of mitochondrial mass, glucose
consumption, and lactate production
Mitochondrial mass was measured by staining with
Mito-Tracker Green. Cells attached to the cover glass were
washed and incubated with pre-warmed Mito-Tracker
staining solution with a final concentration of 100 nM
at 37°C in the dark. Staining solution was removed after
30 min and replaced by pre-warmed fresh culture medium.
Afterwards, the cells were observed under a fluorescence
microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, Tokyo, Japan).

The migration abilities of cells were measured
by transwell assays with modified Boyden chambers
containing polycarbonate filters (Millipore, MA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
seeded into the upper Boyden chambers in serum-free
medium and allowed to invade towards 10% FBS medium
for 12 to 48 h. Cells that remained on top of the filter
were removed using a cotton applicator and the invaded
cells at the opposite side of the filter were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet
before counting under a microscope.
