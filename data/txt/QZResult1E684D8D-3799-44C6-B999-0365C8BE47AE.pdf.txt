Abstract
Chronic inﬂammation has been implicated as an etiologic factor in cancer, whereas autophagy may help
preserve cancer cell survival but exert anti-inﬂammatory effects. How these phenomenas interact during
carcinogenesis remains unclear. We explored this question in a human bronchial epithelial cell–based model
of lung carcinogenesis that is mediated by subchronic exposure to arsenic. We found that sustained overexpression of the pro-inﬂammatory IL6 promoted arsenic-induced cell transformation by inhibiting autophagy.
Conversely, strategies to enhance autophagy counteracted the effect of IL6 in the model. These ﬁndings were
conﬁrmed and extended in a mouse model of arsenic-induced lung cancer. Mechanistic investigations suggested
that mTOR inhibition contributed to the activation of autophagy, whereas IL6 overexpression was sufﬁcient to
block autophagy by supporting Beclin-1/Mcl-1 interaction. Overall, our ﬁndings argued that chronic inﬂammatory states driven by IL6 could antagonize autophagic states that may help preserve cancer cell survival and
promote malignant progression, suggesting a need to uncouple inﬂammation and autophagy controls to enable
tumor progression. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3740–52. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Sterile inﬂammation refers to a host inﬂammatory response
to physically or chemically induced injuries in the absence of
microorganisms. Chronic sterile inﬂammation caused by continuous exposure to chemical carcinogens has been linked to
various steps of tumorigenesis (1). Overproduction of speciﬁc
cytokines and abnormal activation of some transcription factors
have been involved in the oncogenic action of chronic inﬂammation (2). On the basis of their relation to inﬂammation,
cytokines can be roughly classiﬁed as pro- or anti-inﬂammatory
cytokines, although many of them have both pro- and antiinﬂammatory functions depending on the situations. The proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL1, IL2, IL6, and TNFa, are
mostly considered as tumor promoting (3). For example, IL6 is
elevated in human colon (4), gastric (5) and oral cancers (6).
Autophagy, a catabolic process, functions in maintaining
cellular homeostasis. Dysfunctional proteins and organelles

are sequestered in autophagosomes and subsequently degraded by lysosomal machinery. Autophagy has been suggested as a
new immunologic paradigm acting basically as a negative
mediator of inﬂammation (7–9). Autophagy is mainly controlled by three systems: (i) LC3 (MAP1LC3A)-PE conjugation
system converting LC3-I to LC3-II, which functions in autophagosome membrane elongation, (ii) ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) protein kinase complex, which is
regulated by mTOR, and (iii) Beclin-1/Vps34 complex by which
Beclin-1 (BECN1) interacts with class III PI3K (Vps34) and
other proteins to initiate autophagosome formation.
Arsenic is a carcinogen. Humans are exposed to arsenic via
both environmental contamination and occupational exposure. Chronic, low-dose arsenic exposure increases the risks of
many cancers, including lung cancer (10). However, the underlying mechanism is not clear. Exposed to external environment, the lung is particularly sensitive to injury and inﬂammation induced by arsenic. Chronic airway inﬂammation
alters the microenvironment in the bronchial epithelium and
lung and may promote pulmonary carcinogenesis (11).
Arsenic-induced cell transformation, a process converting
normal cells into a cancer-like state of uncontrolled division,
is a critical step for arsenic tumorigenesis. Subchronic
exposure of human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) to lowdose arsenic inducing cell transformation has been used as
an in vitro model system by us and many others (12, 13)
for mechanistic study of arsenic carcinogenesis. Using this
model system, we have previously shown subchronic arsenic
exposure–induced BEAS-2B cell transformation accompanied with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and autophagy activation (14). However, the patterns
for ROS and autophagy alteration were different. Arsenic

IL6 Inhibits Autophagy through Beclin-1/Mcl-1 Association

exposure generated a prolonged and steady increase of ROS
levels, whereas the activation of autophagy, after an initial
boost by arsenic administration, decreased in response to
prolonged arsenic exposure. Our data further indicated that
oxidative stress was the force driving cell transformation
and autophagy was the cell self-defense mechanism against
arsenic-induced ROS generation and cell transformation.
With the adequate protection from autophagy, short-term
arsenic exposure did not cause cell transformation. However, the activation of autophagy decreased upon sustained
arsenic exposure and the decreased protection by autophagy
with increased oxidative stress leads to cellular oxidative
damage and cell transformation.
Chronic inﬂammation and autophagy have been suggested
for quite a while as an etiologic factor and cellular protective
mechanism, respectively, for carcinogenesis (15). However, in
our knowledge, their interactions have not been directly investigated. Subchronic exposure of BEAS-2B cells to arsenic
causing cell transformation serves as an appropriate model
system to study their interactions as well as how the interactions relate to arsenic carcinogenesis. In the present study, we
discovered that subchronic exposure of BEAS-2B cells to
arsenic steadily increased the production of IL6, which promoted arsenic-induced cell transformation by inhibiting
autophagy, enhancing autophagy counteracted the action of
IL6. Our data indicate that autophagy was regulated positively
by inhibition of mTOR and negatively by overproduction of IL6
in the presence of arsenic. In addition, IL6 regulated autophagy
by mediating Beclin-1/Mcl-1 association through STAT3.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Sodium arsenite solution (70039), rapamycin (R0395), puromycin (P8833), and antibodies directed against actin (A5441)
and p62/SQSTM1 (P0067) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Anti-LC3 antibody (PM036) was purchased from Medical and
Biological Laboratories. Anti-GM-CSF antibody (NB600-632)
was purchased from Novus. Anti-IL6 (ab6672), anti-cleaved Bid
(ab10640), and anti-Mcl-1 (ab3184) antibodies were purchased
from Abcam. Anti-Bcl-2 antibody was purchased from Santa
Cruz. The antibodies directed against Bcl-xL (2764), Mcl-1
(5453), Bcl-w (2724), Bad (9292), Beclin-1 (3495 and 4122), pmTOR (5536), mTOR (2983), p-P70S6K (9324), P70S6K (2708),
p-4E-BP1 (2855), 4E-BP1 (9644), and recombinant human IL6
(8904SC) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
Cell culture and treatments
Human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B and NL-20 from
ATCC and human small airway epithelial cells SAEC from
Lonza were cultured in growth medium [BEGM (CC-3170,
Lonza) for BEAS-2B, SAGM (CC-3118, Lonza) for SAEC, and
F-12 with required additives for NL-20]. BEAS-2B cells were
tested and authenticated in January 2014 by Promega by short
tandem repeat (STR) analysis as described in 2012 in ANSI
Standard (ASN-0002). SAEC and NL-20 were obtained directly
from the cell banks and passaged in our laboratory for fewer
than 6 months. Sodium arsenite solution was used for
arsenic treatment as previously reported (14). For short-term

(24 hours) arsenic exposure, cells were grown to 80% to
90% conﬂuence before being treated with 0.25 mmol/L sodium
arsenite. For prolonged (1–16 weeks) arsenic exposure, 1  106
cells were plated into each 75-cm2 ﬂask. On the second day, the
cells were rinsed with fresh medium and cultured with new
growth media containing 0.25 mmol/L sodium arsenite for
3 days before the media were changed one more time. Sodium
arsenite solutions were diluted in the medium before each
medium change. After 6 days of growth in the ﬂasks, the cells
were detached using trypsin, 1  106 of these cells were
replated into a new ﬂask, and the treatments were repeated
for a total of 16 weeks. The rest of the cells/protein samples
were collected and reserved for future analysis. Nontreated
passage-matched cells served as a control.
Plasmids and transfection
IL6 shRNA plasmid (19959), IL6 scramble control plasmid
(19960), and pcDNA3-Beclin-1 plasmid (21150) were purchased
from Addgene. GM-CSF shRNA plasmid (TF313703), STAT3
shRNA plasmid (TF301348), and Mcl-1 siRNA (SR302834) were
purchased from Origene. For transfection, cells were transfected with plasmids or siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, 11668-019) and selected by G418 (Invitrogen,
11811) or puromycin (Sigma P8833) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Cytokine production assay
The cytokines productions were evaluated using MultiAnalyte ELISArray kit (Qiagen, MEH-004A). For acute
arsenic treatment, cells were plated in 12-well plates at a
density of 1  105 cells/well and treated with 0.25 mmol/L
sodium arsenite in BEGM medium for 24 hours and the
supernatants were collected and analyzed. For prolonged
arsenic treatment, cells were exposed to 0.25 mmol/L sodium
arsenite for 1 to 16 weeks as described above. Then, the cells
were replated in 12-well plates at a density of 1  105 cells per
well and treated with 0.25 mmol/L sodium arsenite for 24 hours.
The supernatants were collected for ELISA. Because the cells
kept proliferating in the growth medium with 0.25 mmol/L
sodium arsenite, this method measured the cytokine levels that
were produced by the same amount of cells.
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription
PCR
The mRNA levels were analyzed by quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Brieﬂy, cells were collected for
total RNA extraction by a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596–
026). The quality of the total RNA was conﬁrmed by the
integrity of 28S and 18S rRNA. The ﬁrst-strand cDNA was
synthesized using a Reverse Transcription System (Promega,
A3500). PCR was performed on a Lightcycler 480 system
(Roche) using a Power SYBR Green PCR Master kit (Invitrogen, 4368706). After ﬁnishing the last cycle, a melting curve
analysis was performed. Standard DDCt method was used
for determining changes in gene expression. The relative
expression level of a given mRNA was assessed by normalizing to b-actin and comparing with control values.
The primers used for analysis were as below: IL6 forward:

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
The immunoblotting procedure has been previously
described (16). Brieﬂy, aliquots of the protein samples (20–
40 mg) were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the membranes
were probed with primary antibodies and then with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The
immune complexes were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (PerkinElmer, NEL105001EA). The blots
were stripped and reprobed with an anti-actin antibody.
Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously
described (16). Brieﬂy, an aliquot of 200 mg of protein was
incubated with the antibody against the target protein overnight at 4 C. About 20 mL of Protein A agarose beads (Cell
Signaling Technology, 9863) were added to the lysate, and the
mixture was incubated for 3 hours at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates
were collected by centrifugation at 10,000  g for 10 minutes.
The pellets were then resuspended in 20 mL of 3 SDS sample
buffer and analyzed for the expression of speciﬁc proteins by
immunoblotting.

10 days after injection. Tumor volume was calculated by the
modiﬁed ellipsoidal formula (17): tumor volume (mm3) ¼ 1/2
(xy2); x is the greatest longitudinal diameter and y is greatest
transverse diameter.
Statistical analysis
Differences among treatment groups were tested by
ANOVA. Data are represented as mean  SEM of three
experiments. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
In cases in which signiﬁcant differences were detected, speciﬁc
post-hoc comparisons between treatment groups were examined by Student–Newman–Keul tests.

Results

Soft agar assay
Cell transformation was determined by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as described previously (14). Brieﬂy,
equal volumes of 1.5% agar (in 1 PBS) and 1 BEGM were
mixed at 40 C. Two milliliters of the mixture (containing 0.75%
agar) was added into 6-well plates as a base agar. Then, 5,000 of
control or treated cells that were suspended in 2 mL of second
BEGM-agar mixture (containing 0.35% agar) were added in
each well as top agar. Top agar was covered with 1 mL of
culture medium and the medium was replaced with fresh
medium every 3 days. Plates were placed in an incubator at
37 C and 5% CO2; and after 4 weeks, the colonies were stained
with 0.005% crystal violet and quantiﬁed/photographed.

The secretion and mRNA levels of IL6 and GM-CSF are
increased upon subchronic arsenic treatment
Previously, we have shown that exposure of BEAS-2B cells to
0.25 mmol/L sodium arsenite for 16 weeks induced cell transformation evidenced by colony formation in soft agar and
tumor formation in nude mice. The justiﬁcation for the use of
sodium arsenite at 0.25 mmol/L has been elucidated in detail
(14). Brieﬂy, there are two major reasons: (i) it is an environmentally relevant concentration and (ii) arsenic-induced cell
transformation was not dose-dependent among the dosages
(0.25, 0.5, and 1 mmol/L) that can induce BEAS-2B cell transformation. Here, we ﬁrst sought to determine whether inﬂammatory cytokines were regulated by arsenic during cell transformation. A cytokine production proﬁle was generated after
the cells were treated with arsenic for 24 hours, 1 and 16 weeks.
After a literature search, 12 cytokines including both pro- and
anti-inﬂammatory ones were selected. Among these cytokines,
the production of IL6, IL8, TNFa, and granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was increased 24 hours
after arsenic treatment (Fig. 1A). However, only IL6 and GMCSF levels stayed upregulated after 1 and 16 weeks. In addition,
the increase of IL6 was in a time-dependent manner whereas
the increase of GM-CSF was not. The mRNA levels of IL6 and
GM-CSF in arsenic-treated cells were also increased (Fig. 1B),
indicating that arsenic transcriptionally enhanced the levels of
IL6 and GM-CSF.

Animals and tumorigenicity assay
Five-week-old male athymic nude mice were purchased
from Harlan Laboratories and housed in a speciﬁc pathogen-free room in the Animal Facility at the University of
Kentucky Medical Center (Lexington, KY). All procedures were
performed in accordance with the guidelines set by the NIH
and the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Kentucky.
Nude mouse xenograft assays were performed as described
previously (14). Brieﬂy, cells treated with arsenic for 16 weeks
and nontreated passage-matched control cells were harvested
and adjusted to a cell density of 1  107 cell/mL in cell culture
medium. About 0.2 mL of the cell suspension was injected
subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of the 6-week-old nude mice
(n ¼ 6). Tumors were allowed to grow for 3 weeks. The greatest
longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest transverse
diameter (width) of a tumor were measured by external caliper

Overproduction of IL6, not GM-CSF, promotes arsenicinduced cell transformation
To determine whether the increase of IL6 and/or GM-CSF
contributed to arsenic-induced cell transformation, IL6 or GMCSF knocking down (KD) cell lines were established by stably
transfected BEAS-2B cells with IL6 or GM-CSF shRNA plasmids, respectively (Fig. 2A). These KD cells were then exposed
to arsenic for 16 weeks and cell transformation was tested by
soft agar assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, IL6 KD signiﬁcantly
decreased arsenic-induced cell transformation whereas GMCSF KD did not. These results indicated that, although IL6 and
GM-CSF were both upregulated by subchronic arsenic treatment, only IL6 contributed to arsenic-induced transformation.
This was further conﬁrmed by a tumorigenicity assay (Fig. 2C)
in which BEAS-2B or IL6 KD cells were injected into the nude
mice after these cells were treated with arsenic for 16 weeks. As

expected, IL6 KD signiﬁcantly decreased the tumor sizes
compared with the arsenic-treated control group. However,
IL6 KD did not change the incidence rate.
IL6 negatively regulates autophagy activity
Because autophagy has been shown as a protective mechanism against arsenic-induced cell transformation in this
model (14), we next sought to determine whether autophagy
activity could be altered by manipulating IL6 levels. We
inhibited IL6 using IL6 KD cells and enhanced it using human
recombinant IL6 at 10 ng/mL, this concentration of IL6 has
been shown to affect cell transformation (18). Arsenic at 0.25
mmol/L increased LC3-II, which has been veriﬁed as a result
of enhanced autophagy activity in our previous work (14).
Thus, we evaluated autophagy activity by measuring LC3-II
levels in BEAS-2B cells treated with arsenic, arsenic plus IL6,
or in IL6 KD cells treated with arsenic. As shown in Fig. 3A,
while co-treatment of IL6 inhibited arsenic-induced LC3-II
upregulation, IL6 KD further increased LC3-II, indicating that

3744

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

IL6 may inhibit autophagy activity. To conﬁrm that the
alteration of LC3-II reﬂected the change of autophagic ﬂux,
the expression levels of P62 (SQSTM1) were also evaluated.
p62 is an autophagosome membrane–associated protein and
is degraded in lysosomes after autophagosomes fuse with
lysosomes; thus, its level is negatively regulated by autophagic
ﬂux. As expected, p62 generally had an opposite alteration
pattern compared with LC3-II conﬁrming IL6 inhibited
autophagy activity. To determine whether the inhibitive effect
of IL6 on arsenic-mediated autophagy activity is cell-type–
speciﬁc, we performed the same experiment in SAEC cells (a
human small airway epithelial cell line) as well as NL-20 cells
(a human bronchial epithelial cell line). Both of these cell
lines, like BEAS-2B, were isolated from normal human tissue
and are nontumorigenic. As shown in Fig. 3B and C, IL6
inhibited arsenic-induced upregulation of LC3-II and downregulation of p62 in both of these cell lines. Therefore, the
inhibition of autophagy activity by IL6 is not exclusive in
BEAS-2B cells.

IL6 promotes arsenic-induced cell transformation
through inhibition of autophagy
To further investigate whether inhibition of autophagy
contributed to IL6-promoted cell transformation, we determined whether upregulation of autophagy can counteract
the action of IL6. To upregulate autophagy, we used rapamycin and Beclin-1 overexpression, respectively. Rapamycin
is an inhibitor of mTOR and a widely used enhancer of

3746

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

autophagy (14). Beclin-1 (BECN1) is a key regulator of
autophagy (19), and overexpression of Beclin-1 increases
autophagy activity (20, 21). The enhanced basal as well as
arsenic-induced autophagy activities by Beclin-1 overexpression were conﬁrmed by increased LC3-II and decreased p62
levels (Fig. 4A and B). Beclin-1–overexpressed cells as well as
regular BEAS-2B cells were exposed to arsenic, with or
without human recombinant IL6, rapamycin, or rapamycin

plus IL6 for 16 weeks and soft agar assay was performed
thereafter. As shown in Fig. 4C, IL6 enhanced arsenicinduced colony formation, whereas co-treatment with rapamycin or overexpression of Beclin-1 blocked this action of
IL6. These results indicated that IL6 promoted cell transformation by inhibiting autophagy.
IL6 inhibits autophagy activity through mediating Mcl-1/
Beclin-1 association
We next investigated the mechanism underlying IL6
inhibited autophagy activity. Because mTOR is a well-known
autophagy regulator and inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin
ameliorated IL6-enhanced arsenic-induced transformation
(Fig. 4C), we ﬁrst determined whether IL6 inhibited autophagy through mTOR. As shown in Fig. 5A, acute arsenic
treatment inhibited mTOR evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of mTOR as well as its substrates eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1 or
EIF4EBP1) and P70S6 kinase (P70S6K), and the inhibition
was reduced upon prolonged arsenic exposure. Unexpectedly, IL6 KD did not alter the pattern of the change of these
marker proteins. Apparently, mTOR was not the target of
IL6. Then, as (i) Beclin-1 overexpression reversed the inhibition of autophagy by IL6, (ii) binding of Beclin-1 and Bcl-2
(BCL2) proteins regulates autophagy (22), and (iii) Bcl-2
family is the downstream target of IL6/STAT3 (23), we
sought to determine whether Bcl-2 proteins were involved
in autophagy inhibition by IL6 upon arsenic treatment. We
evaluated the expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl (BCL2L1), Bcl-w (BCL2L2), and Mcl-1
(MCL1), as well as pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, tBid (tBID)
and Bad (BAD), after BEAS-2B cells were treated with arsenic
for 24 hours, 1 and 16 weeks. These Bcl-2 proteins were
chosen because: (i) Beclin-1 binds only to anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins (24), (ii) BH-3–only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
may interfere with the binding between anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
proteins and Beclin-1, and (iii) tBid and Bad represent the
activator and enabler members for the BH-3–only Bcl-2 proapoptotic proteins (25). Among these Bcl-2 proteins, only the
levels of Mcl-1 were changed by arsenic as shown in Fig. 5B.
Arsenic treatment at 24 hours inhibited Mcl-1 expression,
but this inhibition was reversed and upregulated by prolonged arsenic exposure. The effects of arsenic on Mcl-1
expression in SAEC and NL-20 cells were also examined after
arsenic treatment for 24 hours, 1 and 3 weeks. Consistent
with our observation in BEAS-2B cells, Mcl-1 expressions
were downregulated by arsenic at 24 hours but the downregulations were reversed upon prolonged arsenic exposure
in both SAEC and NL-20 cells (Fig. 5C). Because the different
effects of acute and prolonged arsenic exposure on Mcl-1
had been observed after 24 hours, 1 and 3 weeks of arsenic
exposure, we adopted these time points for arsenic treatment in these cells. Moreover, as Mcl-1 has been shown as a
target of IL6 (26), we further determined whether arsenic
altered Mcl-1 levels through IL6. As shown in Fig. 5D, IL6 KD
did not alter the inhibition of Mcl-1 by acute arsenic
treatment but it abolished the upregulation of Mcl-1 by
prolonged arsenic exposure, and co-treatment with IL6

further enhanced the upregulation of Mcl-1 upon arsenic
treatment. As Germain and colleagues have shown that Mcl1 inhibited autophagy by binding to Beclin-1 (27), the role of
IL6/Mcl-1 in regulating autophagy was further evaluated in
Mcl-1 KD cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, Mcl-1 KD blocked IL6mediated suppression of arsenic-induced LC3-II upregulation. The binding of Mcl-1 and Beclin-1 was further determined by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 5F, the
binding of these 2 proteins was decreased at 24 hours but it
was increased after 1 week of arsenic exposure. Because the
increased binding can be detected 1 week after arsenic
treatment, to further determine the effects of IL6 on Mcl1 expression as well as Mcl-1/Beclin-1 association in BEAS2B, SAEC, and NL-20 cells, we treated these cells with IL6 for
1 week. IL6 signiﬁcantly increased Mcl-1 levels in all 3 cell
lines (Fig. 5G). More importantly, along with the increased
Mcl-1 expression, the association between Mcl-1 and Beclin1 was enhanced by IL6. Taken together, these data indicated
that autophagy was inhibited by IL6 upon prolonged arsenic
exposure through upregulating Mcl-1, which increased the
binding of Mcl-1 and Beclin-1.
IL6 and mTOR regulate Mcl-1 through STAT3 in response
to arsenic exposure
Because rapamycin reversed IL6-enhanced cell transformation (Fig. 4C), we further investigated the roles of mTOR
and IL6 in regulating Mcl-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 6A,
rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, did not alter the inhibition
of Mcl-1 by arsenic at 24 hours but it abolished the upregulation of Mcl-1 after 1 week of arsenic exposure (compared with Mcl-1 in Fig. 5B). Considering that (i) acute
arsenic treatment inhibited mTOR (Fig. 5A), (ii) the inhibition was decreased and Mcl-1 expression was increased
upon prolonged arsenic exposure (Fig. 5B), (iii) arsenic
increased IL6 production in a time-dependent manner (Fig.
1A and B), and (iv) co-treatment of IL6 further enhanced
Mcl-1 expression with prolonged arsenic exposure (Fig. 5D),
IL6 and mTOR may regulate Mcl-1 expression in response to
different durations of arsenic treatment. Acute arsenic
treatment inhibited mTOR and downregulated Mcl-1,
whereas prolonged arsenic exposure upregulated IL6, which
enhanced Mcl-1 expression. We speculated that a downstream target of IL6/mTOR might exist and through which
IL6 and mTOR regulated Mcl-1 expression. A possible candidate for such a downstream regulator would be STAT3, a
transcriptional factor that controls Mcl-1 expression (28)
and its own activity can be regulated by both IL6 and mTOR
(29–31). To test this hypothesis, we knocked down STAT3 by
STAT3 shRNA (Fig. 6B). Because 1 week is the turning point
for the alteration of Mcl-1 in response to acute or prolonged
arsenic treatment (as shown in Figs. 5B–D and F and 6A), we
tested the effects of STAT3 KD on arsenic-induced Mcl-1
alteration 24 hours, 1 and 3 weeks after arsenic exposure. As
shown in Fig. 6C, STAT3 KD abolished both acute and
prolonged arsenic-induced alterations of Mcl-1 (top, compared with Fig. 5B). Furthermore, STAT3 KD inhibited the
alterations of Mcl-1 by co-treatment of IL6 (middle, compared with right of Fig. 5D) or rapamycin (bottom, compared

IL6 Inhibits Autophagy through Beclin-1/Mcl-1 Association

IL6 regulate Mcl-1 expression upon arsenic exposure
through STAT3.

Discussion
Cytokines are small signaling molecules produced by virtually all nucleated cells, but especially endothelial/epithelial
cells and resident macrophages, in response to microbes or
tumor antigens. They mediate intracellular signaling and
regulate homeostasis of the immune system. Dysregulated
cytokine secretion from sustained inﬂammation can drive
oncogenesis (32). The role of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in
arsenic carcinogenesis has become more evident recently.
Increased secretion of IL8 and IL6 has been shown to positively
correlate with arsenic-induced malignant transformation of
urothelial (33) as well as bronchial epithelial cells (18). This
study aimed to investigate a possible interaction between
autophagy and chronic inﬂammation and how the interaction
relates to arsenic carcinogenesis. Using a model system of
arsenic-induced cell transformation, we identiﬁed pro-inﬂammatory cytokine IL6 playing a promoting role in arsenic
carcinogenesis by inhibiting autophagy. Although arsenic
acutely increased the secretion levels of IL6, IL8, TNFa, and
GM-CSF, only IL6 and GM-CSF were overproduced upon
subchronic arsenic exposure, and it was IL6, among these
cytokines, that contributed to arsenic-induced transformation.
It is worth noting that IL6 KD did not decrease the incidence
rate of tumor formation (Fig. 2C), indicating a promoting role
rather than a causal role of IL6 in arsenic-induced cell
transformation.
Autophagy functions in cellular defense against excessive inﬂammation (34). Defects in autophagy under the
condition of chronic inﬂammation contributes to oncogenesis (15). It is generally accepted that defects in autophagy contribute to inﬂammation as autophagy functions in
cellular homeostasis. Failure to remove cellular garbage in
autophagy-defective cells/tissues results in cell death, which
certainly is an inﬂammatory stimulus and creates a cancerprone environment. However, not many studies have investigated how inﬂammation regulates autophagy activity. Only
a few have shown conﬂicting results regarding how acute
inﬂammation regulates autophagy (35–37), and little
research has been conducted to investigate how chronic
inﬂammation may regulate autophagy activity as well as its
consequence related to carcinogenesis. The current study is
the ﬁrst one in our knowledge revealing that sustained
inﬂammation inhibits autophagy activity and the compro-

mised protective capability of autophagy enhances inﬂammation-promoted carcinogenesis.
Beclin-1 is an essential autophagy protein involved in
diverse biologic functions. Beclin-1 binds to class III PI3K
(Vsp34) and other proteins, forming a complex that is
required for autophagosome initiation. Binding to proteins
of the Bcl-2 family through its BH3 domain sequesters
Beclin-1 from forming complexes with Vsp34 and thus
inhibits autophagy activity (38). Regulation of Bcl-2/
Beclin-1 interaction represents a central mechanism by
which autophagy is turned on or off (39). In this study,
overexpression of Beclin-1 ameliorated the inhibition of
autophagy by IL6, indicating that IL6 inhibited autophagy
through sequestering Beclin-1. Our results identiﬁed a
new action of IL6: regulating autophagy activity through
mediating Mcl-1/Beclin-1 interaction. Notably, the inhibitive
effect of IL6 on autophagy was shown here in three different
human lung epithelial cell lines derived from normal
tissue and none of which are tumor cells. We noted that
Kang and colleagues reported that in Panc02 mouse pancreatic tumor cells, IL6 enhanced autophagy activity, which
promoted cancer cell growth (40, 41). Thus, it is possible that
the effects of IL6 on autophagy are different between tumor
and nontumor or human and rodent cells. Indeed, it has
been reported that autophagy may function as a tumor
suppressor in normal cells and tumor promoter in cancer
cells (42).
In our previous work, we have shown that arsenic treatment inhibited mTOR, which activated autophagy. The
inhibition of mTOR as well as autophagy activation were
decreased upon prolonged arsenic treatment (14). In the
present study, arsenic enhanced IL6 secretion in a timedependent manner (Fig. 1A) and IL6 inhibited autophagy
upon prolonged arsenic treatment. These observations are
coincident with that whereas Mcl-1 was downregulated by
acute arsenic treatment, it was upregulated in response to
prolonged arsenic exposure, and the upregulation of Mcl-1
can be reversed by rapamycin. A reasonable interpretation
for these data is that acute arsenic treatment inhibits
mTOR, which downregulates Mcl-1, decreases the binding
of Mcl-1/Beclin-1, increases the amount of free Beclin-1,
and thus facilitates autophagy activity. In contrast, prolonged arsenic exposure, with increased IL6 production and
decreased mTOR inhibition, upregulates Mcl-1, which
enhances the binding of Mcl-1/Beclin-1, decreases the
amount of free Beclin-1, and inhibits autophagy activity.
Therefore, mTOR and IL6 regulate Mcl-1 expression in
response to different durations of arsenic treatment. Our

data further indicated that mTOR and IL6 regulate Mcl-1
through STAT3, as knocking down STAT3 abolished arsenic-induced Mcl-1 alteration. Thus, STAT3 could be an
important regulator of autophagy by mediating the association between Bcl-2 proteins and Beclin-1. Indeed, a
recent publication has suggested STAT3 as a new autophagy regulator (43). Finally, we also noticed that in different
cells, Beclin-1 may bind with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl rather than
Mcl-1 to regulate autophagy activity (44). Hence, which
