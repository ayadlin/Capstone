BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. METHODS: A tissue microarray was constructed that contained 724 tissue
samples from 340 patients. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the antibody MN-75, the
percentage of positive cells was evaluated, and their association with tumor (T) classification, grade, and
survival was assessed. RESULTS: All normal urothelial tissue samples were negative for CAIX expression,
whereas 71% of bladder cancers expressed CAIX. CAIX expression was higher in noninvasive (Ta) versus
invasive (T1-T4) tumors (P < .001), in low-grade versus high-grade bladder cancer (P < .001), and in metastases versus the corresponding primary tumor (P ¼ .032). For patients with nonmuscle invasive carcinoma
who underwent transurethral resection (TUR), higher CAIX expression was associated with poorer
recurrence-free survival (P ¼ .001). In addition, for patients with T1 tumors who underwent TUR, higher
CAIX expression conveyed a 6.5-fold higher risk of progression into muscle-invasive disease (P ¼ .006). In
patients who underwent cystectomy, higher CAIX expression was associated with worse overall survival (P
¼ .003). Multivariate Cox models revealed that CAIX expression was the strongest, independent prognostic
factor of recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.29; P ¼ .001) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.9; P <
.001). CONCLUSIONS: CAIX was expressed differentially in noninvasive versus invasive tumors, in low-grade
versus high-grade bladder cancer, and in primary tumors versus metastases. The current results indicated
that CAIX is a strong predictor of recurrence, progression, and overall survival of patients with bladder cancer; and the integration of CAIX expression into conventional prognostic models significantly improved their
predictive accuracy. The data suggest a tripartite role of CAIX as a diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic

It has been estimated that approximately 69,000 Americans will be newly affected by bladder cancer in
2008 and that 14,000 will die of the disease.1 The number of newly diagnosed cases has been increasing
over the past decade, mainly because of the more intensive workup of patients who present with hematuria
and irritative voiding symptoms.2 Approximately 90% of all bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas,3

and approximately 75% of these tumors are diagnosed at
a noninvasive tumor (T) classification (Ta, tumor in situ,
or T1). Treatment of these noninvasive tumors consists of
transurethral resection (TUR) with or without intravesical
instillation therapy, but recurrence rates remain as high as
50% to 70%.3 In addition, there is an average risk of 10%
to 20% of progression to muscle-invasive disease,3 eventually requiring radical cystectomy and urinary diversion.
The 5-year overall survival rates for patients who undergo
cystectomy for bladder cancer are poor and vary between
58% and 66%.4-6 During the past decades, for multiple
reasons, there has been slow progress in improving survival for patients who have muscle-invasive disease.
Although perioperative chemotherapy regimens have
evolved,7,8 generally, they have been underused.9 Currently, there are only a few established anatomic and histologic prognostic factors for recurrence, progression, and
overall survival, including T classification, grade, associated carcinoma in situ (CIS), and the presence of lymph
node metastasis. The prediction of these clinical endpoints remains difficult, and data on molecular markers,
such as p53, have been inconclusive.10
Hypoxia is a consequence of the rapid growth of
many tumors, including bladder cancer, and is an important regulator of gene expression. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a hypoxia-inducible member of
the carbonic anhydrase family that regulates intracellular pH value, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and tumor progression.11,12 Weak CAIX expression is
observed in the normal gastric mucosa, small intestine,
biliary tract, and seminal ducts13; however, its expression is absent in other organ systems, including the
urinary tract. In contrast, CAIX is expressed abundantly as a direct consequence of hypoxia in numerous cancers13 but also is impacted by other pathways
and genetic aberrations.11 Studies have demonstrated
that, in many cancer types, high CAIX expression
yields an aggressive tumor phenotype and a poor
prognosis.14-20 However, with regard to bladder cancer, there have been only a few reports on a limited
number of patients, and those reports produced inconclusive results.21
Therefore, the objective of the current study was to
evaluate the role of CAIX in the biology of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. To accomplish this, we studied
724 tissue samples, including primary tumors, metastases,

and normal urothelial tissue samples, that were derived
from a large cohort of patients with long-term follow-up
who were treated at a single institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Our study cohort consisted of 340 randomly selected
patients who were treated for sporadic urothelial carcinoma
of the bladder by TUR or cystectomy at University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center between 1985
and 1995. There were 274 men (81%) and 66 women
(19%) who were first diagnosed with a bladder tumor at a
median age of 69 years (range, 33-95 years). Clinical, pathologic, and follow-up data were gathered for each patient. All
hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were reviewed by 2
anatomic pathologists (D.B.S and J.Y.R.). Pathologic staging was performed according to the 2002 TNM classification system, and grading was done according to World
Health Organization criteria. The study received approval
by the Institutional Review Board.
Tissue Microarray Construction
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue specimens were obtained from the Department of Pathology,
UCLA Medical Center. Three core tissue biopsies, which
measured 0.6 mm in greatest dimension, were taken from
morphologically representative regions of the tumor and
precisely arrayed using a custom-built instrument, as
described previously.22 If possible, additional core tissue
biopsies were taken from morphologically benign-appearing urothelial tissue of the same specimen. Four-microgram-thick sections of the resulting tissue microarray
block were transferred to glass slides using the paraffin sectioning aid system (adhesive-coated slides [PSA-CS4x],
adhesive tape, and ultraviolet lamp; Instrumedics Inc.,
Hackensack, NJ) to support the cohesion of 0.6-mm array
elements. The tissue microarray comprised 724 samples
from 340 patients, including 543 primary urothelial carcinomas, 46 metastases (of which 38 were extirpated synchronously), 135 normal urothelial tissue samples, and a
total of 2172 tissue spots.

staining was performed with a Dako Envision staining
system (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif), as described previously.23 Briefly, antigens were retrieved by microwave
treatment, endogenous peroxidase was blocked with
H2O2, and the sections were stained with the mouse
monoclonal antibody MN75 at a 1:10,000 dilution. Subsequently, sections were incubated with an antimouseconjugated peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Dako
Envision; Dako) for 30 minutes at room temperature,
then with biotinyl tyramide amplification reagent
(PerkinElmer, Wellesley, Mass) at room temperature for
10 minutes, and observed with application of diaminobenzidine substrate chromagen solution and hematoxylin
counterstain.
Semiquantitative assessment of CAIX staining was
performed by 2 anatomic pathologists (H.Y., D.B.S.)
who were blinded to pathologic variables and survival.
Expression was evaluated as the percentage of the entire
tumor sample that stained positive for CAIX. Maximal
staining intensity was evaluated on a scale from 0 to 3 (0
¼ negative, 3 ¼ strong). After individual assessment of
each spot, a consensus was reached. The overall score that
was used for subsequent analysis was the pooled mean
from all spots in the same tumor.

Statistical Methods
Because of the non-normal distribution of CAIX expression, associations between pathological parameters and
CAIX expression were assessed with Kruskal-Wallis tests.
A Wilcoxon sign rank test was applied for comparison of
CAIX expression in primary bladder cancer and simultaneously extirpated metastases.
Different survival endpoints were assessed for
patients who underwent TUR and patients who underwent cystectomy. Endpoints for the TUR group were the
time to recurrence and the time to progression, both of
which were calculated from the date of TUR to the date of
either recurrence/progression or last follow-up. Progression of disease was defined as any increase in T classification and/or grade category. For patients who underwent
cystectomy, the endpoint was overall survival, which was
defined as the duration from the date of cystectomy to the
date of either death or last follow-up. The time-to-event
curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and
were compared with log-rank tests. We wanted to dichot1450

omize CAIX expression based on staining to allow for an
easier application to clinical practice. For this purpose,
expression cutoff points were obtained with recursive partitioning-based survival tree analysis. Multivariate Cox
proportional hazards models were fit to identify the covariates that were associated independently with survival.
Because information may be lost when Cox models are fit
with dichotomized (and not continuous) variables, separate Cox proportional hazards models were fit with continuous CAIX expression. The predictive accuracy of Cox
models was assessed by using a concordance index (Cindex). To determine whether the integration of CAIX
into the multivariate Cox model led to an increased Cindex, the predictive accuracy of the 2 nested models (the
former without and the latter with CAIX as a covariate)
were compared with the likelihood ratio test. All analyses
were performed with R version 2.4 at a significance level
(P) of .05.

RESULTS
Carbonic Anhydrase IX Expression in
Relation to Pathologic Variables
Seventy-one percent of the urothelial carcinomas stained
positive for CAIX, whereas all normal urothelial samples
were negative for CAIX staining. On the cellular level,
staining predominantly was membranous. There was considerable heterogeneity throughout each tumor. CAIX
staining increased with increasing distance from the fibrovascular core, so that maximum staining was noted on the
luminal surface of the papillary structures (Fig. 1) and in
areas bordering necrotic regions.
CAIX expression was associated with T classification and grade. Expression levels were higher in Ta
tumors than in invasive (T1-T4) carcinomas (P <
.001); however, expression levels did not differ significantly between the T1 through T4 classifications (Fig.
2A). In addition, CAIX expression decreased with
increasing grade (P < .001) (Fig. 2B). Grade 1 and 2
tumors had higher CAIX expression levels than grade
3 tumors, whereas grade 1 and 2 tumors had similar
CAIX expression levels. CAIX expression in CIS was a
notable exception: Mean expression was only 5.7%,
and only 33% of the CIS samples stained positive for
any degree of CAIX.

FIGURE 1. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) staining is observed in normal urothelium (A) and in
urothelial carcinoma (B-D). All normal urothelial samples were negative for CAIX staining. In urothelial carcinoma, CAIX staining
increased with increasing distance from the fibrovascular core, so that maximum staining was observed on the luminal surface of
the papillary structures and in areas bordering necrotic regions. Arrows indicate maximum staining intensity (D).

The same results were observed regarding staining
intensity (data not shown): Intensity was highest in Ta
tumors and similar among tumors classified as T1
through T4. The lowest staining intensity was observed in
CIS. In addition, staining intensity decreased from grade
1 tumors to grade 3 tumors. Expression (frequency) and
staining intensity were highly correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.876; P < .001). Therefore, we restricted subsequent analyses on expression/frequency.
In 38 patients, primary tumor lesions and synchronously extirpated metastases (25 lymph nodes, 13 distant
metastases) both were available for analysis. Expression in
the primary tumor was substantially lower (mean, 13.5%)
than in the corresponding metastasis (mean, 23.9%; P ¼
.032).

Carbonic Anhydrase IX Expression in
Relation to Survival
There were 143 patients who underwent TUR for Ta or
T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and were followed
for a median of 8.9 years (range, 0.02-18.4 years) (Table
1). In this group, a 10% increase in CAIX expression was
associated with a 13% increase in the risk of recurrence
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.013; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.003-1.022; P ¼ .010). For visualization, we identified a cutoff point of 35% for optimal substratification of
these patients according to CAIX expression. There were
108 tumors (76%) with low expression (35%) and
Cancer

35 tumors (24%) with high expression. The median time
to recurrence (standard error) was 39  15 months for
the group with low CAIX expression and 13  4 months
for the group with high CAIX expression, and the corresponding 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival rates were
65% versus 50% and 59% versus 28%, respectively (P ¼
.001) (Fig. 3A). In subanalyses according to T classification, high CAIX expression predicted poorer recurrencefree survival both in patients with Ta disease (P ¼ .046)
and in patients with T1 disease (P ¼ .004) (Fig. 3B,C),
and there was a 6.5-fold increased risk of progression to
muscle-invasive disease (HR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.73-24.63; P
¼ .006) in patients with T1 disease. In multivariate analysis, CAIX expression was identified as the most highly
statistically significant predictor of recurrence after TUR
(Table 2). Two different Cox models were fit: 1 with
CAIX expression as a continuous variable and a second
with dichotomized CAIX expression based on the 35%
cutoff point; however, both models yielded the same
results. In terms of predictive accuracy, a Cox model that
was fit with T classification and grade produced a C-index
of 0.575. The C-index increased by adding CAIX as a
continuous variable (to 0.612) or as a dichotomized variable (to 0.615) in the multivariate Cox model. A likelihood-ratio test for nested models indicated that this
increase was statistically significant (P ¼ .009 and P <
.001, respectively). An association with response to instillation therapy (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG] or interferon-alpha) was not observed.

There were 178 patients who underwent cystectomy
without neoadjuvant therapy for nonmetastatic (M0) urothelial carcinoma. The characteristics of these patients are
provided in Table 3; the median follow-up was 8.5 years
(range, 0.06-17.8 years). In this group, a 10% increase in
CAIX expression carried an 8% increased risk of death
(HR, 1.008; 95% CI, 1.001-1.016; P ¼ .033). A cutoff

1.70-fold increased risk of death (95% CI, 1.19-2.43; P ¼
.004) compared with patients who had low CAIX expression (n ¼ 103; 58%). The 2- and 5-year overall survival
rates for high versus low CAIX-expressing tumors were
51% versus 75% and 34% versus 55%, respectively (median survival, 24 months vs 85 months). In the multivariate analysis, CAIX expression was retained as the most
highly statistically significant independent prognostic factor of overall survival (Table 4). A significant increase in
the C-index was noted when CAIX was added as a continuous variable (from 0.589 to 0.619; P ¼ .012) or as a categorical variable (from 0.589 to 0.628; P < .001) to a
model that included age, T classification, lymph node

DISCUSSION
The main findings of this study are: 1) CAIX is expressed
differentially in noninvasive versus invasive bladder cancer, in low-grade versus high-grade bladder cancer, and in
primary tumors versus metastases; 2) CAIX is an important predictor of recurrence, progression, and overall survival; and 3) the integration of CAIX expression into
conventional prognostic models significantly improves
their predictive accuracy. Our data suggest a role of CAIX
as a diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic molecular
marker for bladder cancer.

terms of recurrence-free survival and overall survival.

Our study confirms that CAIX is not expressed in
normal urothelial tissue but is expressed in >70% of urothelial carcinomas.24,25 According to Turner et al, CIS
represents an exception, because only approximately 30%
1454

of CIS expressed CAIX.24 The reason for the low CAIX
positivity and expression is unknown; the authors
hypothesized that, because it is a flat, noninvasive lesion,
CIS may be less dependent on vascularization and the
hypoxia-induced pathway.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first to
demonstrate that, in metastatic bladder cancer, simultaneously extirpated metastases had higher CAIX expression
than the corresponding primary tumor. This finding
probably reflects the reality that metastases are derived
from the highest dedifferentiated area of a tumor and,
thus, reflects poor prognostic features and subsequently
higher CAIX expression.
Staining of CAIX is heterogeneous throughout each
tumor.26 The greatest CAIX staining usually is observed
around areas of necrosis in invasive tumors or metastases
and on the luminal surface of papillary structures.24,26,27
Therefore, CAIX staining fractions/frequencies of

urothelial carcinoma generally are low, although >70%
of the tumors stain positive for CAIX. Hoskin et al26
reported an average stained tumor fraction of only 9%,
and Wykoff et al27 observed a median staining frequency
of only 5%, although 86% of their specimens had CAIX
expression. These findings were confirmed in the current
analysis.
We observed that CAIX was expressed differentially
in noninvasive versus invasive bladder cancer and in lowgrade versus high-grade bladder cancer. In our study, Ta
tumors and grade 1 and 2 tumors had the highest expression levels. In contrast to our results, 1 group did not
report a significant relation between CAIX expression and
tumor grade.28 However, our findings in terms of T classification are supported by Ord et al,29 who observed that
62% of noninvasive tumors, but only 27% of invasive
tumors, stained positive for CAIX. More recently, in a series of 98 patients with bladder cancer, the same group
observed an increase in CAIX positivity among T1, T2,
and T3 tumors, but expression levels decreased in T4
tumors.28 In contrast, we did not observe any difference
between T1 through T4 tumors. Noninvasive (Ta) and
invasive (T1-T4) bladder cancers are regarded as distinct
pathologic entities, and a 2-pathway model for bladder tumor development has been proposed.24,30 The difference
in CAIX expression may reflect distinct molecular pathways and genetic alterations impacted in these tumors,
which may determine the subsequent development and
risk of recurrence or progression. This also may explain
the lower CAIX expression levels in high-grade tumors
that mostly were present in the invasive tumors.
On a molecular level, hypoxia regulates angiogenesis, glycolysis, pH control, proliferation, and apoptosis,
thereby adapting the cancer to a hypoxic microenvironment. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) mediates
responses to changes in tissue oxygenation by serving as a
transcription factor.31,32 HIF-1 is a heterodimer and consists of HIF-1a and HIF-1b subunits. HIF-1a expression
increases with decreasing oxygen concentration, whereas
HIF-1b is expressed constitutively.33 Under normoxic
conditions, tumor cells continuously synthesize, ubiquitinate, and degrade HIF-1a protein. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1a is not degraded by the ubiquitinproteasome complex. Instead, it moves into the nucleus,
dimerizes with HIF-1b, and binds to hypoxia response
elements within hypoxia-inducible genes and activates

their transcription, eg, carbonic anhydrase 9), vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor,
transforming growth factor-a, erythropoietin, glucose
transporter 1 (GLUT-1), and matrix metalloproteinases.34 However, stimuli other than hypoxia also can
induce HIF-1 activation and subsequent CAIX expression, eg, signaling through the HER2/neu, mitogen-activated protein kinase, or type I insulin-like growth factor
receptor tyrosine kinase, by an oxygen-independent
mechanism.35-37
Taken together, our data suggest a role for CAIX as
a diagnostic marker for bladder cancer. Because CAIX
expression is absent in normal urothelial cells and is
expressed in noninvasive, low-grade bladder cancer, the
evaluation of CAIX may be a useful adjunct to diagnostic
cytology, with which it is notoriously difficult to diagnose
low-grade tumors. Urothelial cells that express CAIX are
diagnostic for bladder cancer; however, negative staining
does not rule it out. It is noteworthy that CAIX expression
can differentiate between normal urothelial cells and lowgrade tumors and, thus, may solve a major problem of urinary cytology. Reinforcing this concept, cells that appear
in the urine and subsequently are assessed by cytology are
those from the highest layer of the urothelium, where
CAIX most likely is expressed. Tumors in which CAIX
expression is low or absent, such as high-grade tumors and
CIS, do not represent a detection problem of urinary
cytology.38
CAIX serves as an important prognostic marker for
urothelial bladder cancer. Our study demonstrated that
high CAIX expression yielded a poorer prognosis in terms
of recurrence, progression, and overall survival. Moreover,
CAIX expression was retained as an independent prognostic factor of survival. A significant increase in predictive
accuracy was observed when CAIX expression was added
as a variable to the prognostic model. Until now, studies
on the role of CAIX as a prognostic factor in bladder cancer were inconclusive. Most studies did not demonstrate a
significant relation, but most were limited in size and had
low statistical power. Ord et al28 reported on the role of
hypoxia and necrosis in 98 patients with bladder cancer
who underwent cystectomy. In addition to CAIX, those
authors evaluated staining for HIF-1a, HIF-2a, and
Bcl2/adenovirus EIB 19 kDA interacting protein 3. They
reported no association between CAIX and survival (P ¼
.55), and none of the markers were retained as

independent prognostic factors. Likewise, in a series of
49 patients reported by Turner et al,24 the recurrence- and
progression-free survival of patients with low and high
CAIX expression was identical. Hussain et al39 investigated 57 patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer for
CAIX expression and correlated their findings with survival. They observed that patients who had tumors with
weak CAIX expression had a trend toward shorter survival, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ .21).
Hoskin et al26 studied 64 patients who received
radiotherapy with carbogen and nicotinamide. In their series, higher CAIX expression predicted poorer cancer-specific and overall survival. The 5-year overall survival rate
in patients who had tumors with higher than median
CAIX expression was 35% versus 71% in patients who
had tumors with low CAIX expression. Furthermore,
CAIX expression was an independent prognostic factor in
multivariate analysis (HR, 3.210 95% CI, 1.16-10.22; P
¼ .02) when CAIX expression and GLUT-1 expression
were entered individually. Taken together, the current
study is the first large surgical series to demonstrate that
CAIX expression can serve as an important predictor of
the 3 survival endpoints in bladder cancer: recurrence,
progression, and overall survival. We speculate that this
difference was not observed in previous studies because of
the low number of assessed specimens, which subsequently hampered statistical analyses. In addition, patient
selection criteria, tissue collection, and staining protocols
may have differed.
Our data generate the hypothesis that CAIX may
serve as a therapeutic target. CAIX is expressed in 70% to
90% of bladder cancers but not in normal urothelial tissue; therefore, it represents an optimal therapeutic target.
There may be a role for CAIX as an intravesical target for
instillation therapy and the systemic treatment of patients
with metastatic disease. Before the initiation of therapy,
immunohistochemical staining for CAIX may determine
whether a tumor can be targeted appropriately. If CAIX
staining is observed, then targeting may be reasonable.
Because CAIX may be expressed in only a fraction of
the tumor, 1 option may be to add CAIX-targeting therapy to established chemotherapeutic agents, such as
gemcitabine.
For CAIX targeting, several agents may be available.
The chimeric monoclonal antibody cG250 was evaluated
1456

in patients with renal cell carcinoma,40,41 it was tolerated
well, and it produced striking antitumor effects.40 In addition, antibody-drug conjugates42 may be appropriate to
target CAIX. In this concept, monoclonal antibodies are
linked with cytotoxic agents, which specifically bind to
target cells that express the antigen. For the treatment of
bladder cancer, cG250 may be conjugated with a chemotherapeutic drug, such as mitomycin. Finally, vaccines
against CAIX may be used to treat bladder cancer, which
also represents an immunosensitive disease that responds
to agents like as interferon-alpha and BCG. Thus, the role
of CAIX as a therapeutic target in bladder cancer is promising and warrants further investigation.
We realize that this study generates the hypothesis
that CAIX may serve as an outstanding molecular marker
for bladder cancer. All results of the current study should
be confirmed in larger, prospective settings. We also suggest testing the hypotheses that were generated, namely,
the potential role of CAIX as an adjunct to urinary cytology and its role as a therapeutic target.
In conclusion, CAIX is expressed differentially in
noninvasive versus invasive bladder cancer, in low-grade
versus high-grade bladder cancer, and in primary tumors
versus metastases. CAIX is a strong predictor of recurrence, progression, and overall survival in patients with
bladder cancer, and the integration of CAIX expression
into conventional prognostic models significantly
improves their predictive accuracy. Our data suggest a
role for CAIX as a diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic
molecular marker. Because CAIX expression is absent in
normal urothelial cells and is highly expressed in noninvasive, low-grade bladder cancer, the evaluation of CAIX
may be a useful adjunct to diagnostic cytology, and intravesical CAIX targeted therapy may be effective in these
high CAIX-expressing tumors. Likewise, because metastatic tumors express high CAIX, an evaluation of systemic CAIX-targeted therapy as a therapeutic approach is
warranted.
