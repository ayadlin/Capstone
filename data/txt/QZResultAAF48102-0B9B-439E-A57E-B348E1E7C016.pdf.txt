BACKGROUND: Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) therapy is associated with the development of kinase
domain mutations. Although many imatinib-resistant mutations respond well to second-generation TKIs, the threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at codon 315 of the breakpoint cluster region/v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene protein fusion Bcr-Abl (T315I) is insensitive to all currently available TKIs. The outcome in such patients after
stem cell transplantation (SCT) is unknown. METHODS: Eight patients with TKI-resistant CML who had T315I mutations underwent 9 transplantations. At the time of SCT, 2 patients were in chronic phase, 3 patients were in accelerated phase; and 3 patients were in second chronic phase. RESULTS: The best responses after SCT were a complete
molecular response (CMR) in 3 patients, a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 4 patients, and a complete hematologic response (CHR) in 1 patient, and 1 patient had no response. The best outcome was for patients who underwent transplantation in chronic phase, and both of those patients remained alive and in complete molecular
remission 14 months and 42 months after SCT. After a median follow-up of 13 months from SCT, 5 patients remained
alive, including 3 patients in CMR, 1 patient in CCyR, and 1 patient in CHR. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that SCT is an effective strategy for patients with CML who have the T315I mutation, particularly in earlier

KEYWORDS: stem cell transplantation, chronic myeloid leukemia, resistance, T315I.

The treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Approximately 50% of
patients with CML who develop resistance to imatinib therapy have mutations in the v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral
oncogene (ABL) kinase domain. Second-generation TKIs are active in vitro and are clinically effective against most breakpoint cluster region-ABL (BCR-ABL) mutants, with the exception of a threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at codon 315 of
the Bcr-Abl protein fusion (T315I).
T315I represents a substitution of the amino acid isoleucine for threonine in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain and is insensitive to all currently available TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) in vitro and clinically.1-3 T315I, also known as the
gatekeeper of the kinase domain, reportedly represents 4% to 20% of all mutations associated with TKI resistance.4,5 The
outcome of patients with T315I depends on the disease stage at the time it is discovered.6,7 Although the outcome of
patients with the T315I mutation may not be immediately fatal, particularly among those in chronic phase (CP), currently, there are no established treatment options for these patients.

Original Article

Stem cell transplantation (SCT) frequently is recommended as the treatment of choice for patients with
T315I. However, to our knowledge, there are no available
data on the outcome of patients with T315I who underwent SCT. In this report, we present the outcome of
patients who had CML with the T315I mutation and
underwent SCT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The records from all patients with CML who received
treatment with TKIs at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center were reviewed to identify those
who had developed the T315I mutation and subsequently
underwent SCT. Patients were classified in CP, accelerated phase (AP), or blast phase (BP) according to standard
criteria.8 BP was categorized as lymphoid or myeloid by
immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Criteria for
response and treatment failure were defined according to
recommendations of the European LeukemiaNet.8
Reverse transcripase-quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) analysis was used to follow Bcr-Abl transcripts from total RNA isolated from peripheral blood in
a single tube assay detecting the b2a2, b3a2, and e1a2
forms and normalized to total abl transcripts as described
previously.9 Mutational analysis was performed using
nested PCR-based Sanger sequencing of the entire BCRABL kinase domain (codons 221-500) with a sensitivity
of 10% to 20% mutation-bearing BCR-ABL transcripts.
Quantification of the T315I mutation was performed by
pyrosequencing with a similar nested PCR approach
(HSQ96 Pyrosequencer; Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) with
a sensitivity of 1% to 5% mutation-bearing BCR-ABL
transcripts.5
Engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive
days with an absolute neutrophil count >0.5  109/L.
Chimerism studies were evaluated on Day 30, Day 100,
and every 3 months thereafter. Mixed chimerism was
defined as the presence of any detectable (1%) recipient
DNA. Infection prophylaxis during the peritransplantation period was given to all patients. After recovery of the
neutrophil count to >1.0  109/L, patients were eligible
to receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii infection using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole given orally
twice weekly or pentamidine given intravenously every 3
weeks. Toxicity was established according to National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria. Graftversus-host disease (GVHD) was graded according to
established criteria.10 Failure was defined as death from

3632

any cause, recurrence of T315I, loss of molecular
response, loss of cytogenetic response, or loss of hematologic response. All patients were treated in institutional
review board-approved protocols and/or registered in an
institutional review board-approved retrospective chart
review protocol.

RESULTS
Between September 2004 and January 2008, 8 patients
with T315I mutation underwent 9 SCTs (7 from
matched unrelated donor [MUD] and 2 from cord
blood). The median age at the time of SCT was 46 years
(range, 26-64 years). All patients had received imatinib (4
as initial therapy and 4 after interferon failure) and had
become resistant. After imatinib failure, 5 patients
received dasatinib, and 1 patient received nilotinib. All
but 1 patient failed to respond to a second-generation
TKI after T315I had been detected (Table 1). One patient
in AP (Patient 7) had no T315I when nilotinib was started
but developed the mutation 2 months after the start of
therapy. At the time, she had achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) that was sustained for 18 months.
She eventually lost her CCyR but maintained a partial
cytogenetic response (PCyR) for 8 months and had a
PCyR (10% Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases) when she underwent SCT.
The median time from CML diagnosis to SCT was
57 months (range, 9-160 months), and the median time
from fist detection of T315I to SCT was 7 months (range,
2-29 months). At the time of SCT, 2 patients in CP
(Patients 3 and 7) had a PCyR; 3 patients in AP, all without a complete hematologic response (CHR); and there
were 3 patients in second or greater CP from lymphoid
BP, including 1 patient who underwent 2 transplantations
(both times in second CP), of whom 1 patient who had a
minor cytogenetic response (Patient 5a; first MUD), 2
patients who had a major molecular response (Patients 2
and 6), and 1 patient had a complete molecular response
(CMR) (Patient 5b; second MUD for extramedullary recurrence) (Table 1).
Conditioning regimens were myeloablative in 2
patients, 4 patients received reduced-intensity conditioning, and 1 patient underwent first transplantation with an
ablative regimen followed by a second transplantation
with a reduced-intensity regimen. Regimen details were
unknown for 1 patient (SCT was performed elsewhere)
(Table 2). The stem cell source was bone marrow in 4
patients, peripheral blood in 1 patient, cord blood in 2

patients, and unknown in 2 patients. Unrelated donors
were used in all transplantations. GVHD prophylaxis was
tacrolimus-based in 6 transplantations and unknown in 3
transplantations. The median time to engraftment was 12
days (range, 10-14 days). The best responses after SCT
were CMR in 3 patients (2 in CP, 1 in second CP), CCyR
in 4 patients (2 in AP, 2 in second CP), and CHR in 1
patient (in AP). One patient did not achieve any response
(second CP). The median time from SCT to last followup was 13 months (range, 5-42 months). (Table 2)
Five patients remained alive a median of 20 months after SCT (range, 10-42 months). Two patients who underwent transplantation in CP remained alive 14 months and
42 months after SCT, both in CMR. One patient in BP
(Patient 5) has a CMR that has been sustained for 10 months
after a second SCT (this patient developed a recurrence 5
months after the first SCT). One patient who underwent
transplantation in AP (Patient 1) has a sustained CCyR 26
months after SCT with persistent T315I (representing 94%
of transcripts). And another patient who underwent transplantation in AP (Patient 8) had a CHR and persistent
T315I 39 months after the SCT and currently is receiving
treatment with omacetaxine (homoharringtonine).
None of the 2 patients in CP has failed; both
patients are alive and in CMR 14 months and 42 months
after SCT. The median failure-free survival after SCT was
6 months for patients who underwent transplantation in
AP and 4 months for patients who underwent transplantation in BP (Fig. 1, top). T315I recurrence was the reason
for failure in 3 patients. However, only 1 of the patients
(Patient 6) who underwent transplantation in second CP
had disease progression to AP and died. Two patients
(Patients 1 and 8) are alive and have maintained their
responses (CCyR and CHR) 41 months and 45 months
after the detection of T315I.
Only 1 patient was weaned off immunosuppressors
after loosing chimerism (Patient 8). Two patients had
grade 3 acute GVHD, and all responded to therapy. The
median overall survival after SCT has not been reached.
Three patients died, all with recurrent disease, including 1
patient in AP (Patient 4) who died 10 months after SCT
and 2 patients in second CP (Patients 2 and 6) who died 8
months and 5 months after SCT, respectively. No transplantation-related deaths were reported (Fig. 1, bottom).

generation TKIs after imatinib failure, some patients do
not achieve an optimal response, and others eventually
lose their response. The most common mechanism of resistance identified in patients after failure to therapy with
TKI is the development of ABL kinase domain mutations.
There are over 90 different mutants reported in the literature, and most of these are inhibited both in vitro and in
vivo by currently available TKIs.4 The 1 exception is
T315I, which is insensitive both in vitro and in vivo to the
available inhibitors. The reported incidence of T315I after imatinib failure ranges from 4% to 20%, and it has
been suggested that the incidence may increase after second-generation TKI therapy, with reported incidences up
to 30%.5,11-13 T315I also seems to be observed more frequently with disease transformation.13,14 Recent reports
from studies with nilotinib and dasatinib have demonstrated the anticipated clinical inefficacy of these agents in
patients who develop this mutation.15,16 There is variability in the reported long-term outcome of patients with

Cancer

T315I. It is clear that the expected survival depends
greatly on the disease stage at the time T315I is identified.
In 1 series, Nicolini et al reported a median survival of
42.5 months from start of imatinib for patients in CP,
and a recent multicenter series reported a median survival
of 22 months for such patients.7,17 In contrast, the median survival was not reached in the series reported by Jabbour et al, who reported a 2-year survival rate of 87%,
similar to that of other patients who had similar criteria
for imatinib failure, regardless of mutations status.6 Still,
patients with T315I are considered to have a poor longterm outcome in view of the lack of available effective
treatment options.
Several agents are being investigated that have promising in vitro clinical activity against T315I; and, for some
of those agents, early clinical results suggest that some
patients may respond.18-23 With omacetaxine, early
reports suggest a CHR rate of 85% and a cytogenetic
response rate of 28%.23 The novel kinase inhibitor MK0457 induced anecdotal responses, but its development
was halted for safety reasons.24 Some responses have been
reported in early results of trials with the Aurora kinase
inhibitors XL-228 (cytogenetic responses in 3 of 9
patients with T315I who were treated)22 and PHA739358 (cytogenetic responses in 2 of 6 patients with
T315I).25 AP24534 and DCC2036 are promising agents
with strong preclinical activity in vitro, and phase 1 studies have been initiated.20,26 Still, it is widely perceived that
SCT would be the preferred therapy for patients who
would be eligible for this treatment option. In fact, despite
the availability of the investigational options mentioned
above, at our institution, SCT is offered to all patients
who develop T315I, although transplantation may or
may not happen immediately, depending on availability
of donors, patient’s preference, and other factors. To our
knowledge, despite the limited numbers presented in this
report, this represents the first series of patients with the
T315I mutation who underwent SCT.
The role of SCT has evolved over the last few years
as the treatment of CML has improved with the emergence of TKIs. Today, few patients are considered for
SCT as initial therapy in CP, although SCT remains an
important consideration after imatinib failure. It has been
demonstrated that prior therapy with imatinib not only
does not adversely affect the outcome of patients who
undergo allogeneic SCT, but it actually may improve survival after transplantation for those who undergo transplantation in first CP.27 Similarly, it has been reported
that previous exposure to a second-generation TKI did

3635

Original Article

not increase transplantation-related toxicity or the risk
thereof.28
Although the published experience is limited, it has
been demonstrated that SCT is effective in the setting of
ABL kinase domain mutations. In a series of 10 patients
with various mutations (2 patients with T315I, who were
included in the current report; 5 patients with P-loop
mutationsl and 3 patients with other mutations), 7
patients achieved a CMR, and 2 patients achieved a major
molecular response (1 patient did not respond to the
transplantation).29 Seven patients were alive at the time of
the report, including 6 patients in CMR at a median follow-up of 19 months. That the presence of TKI mutations would have little if any impact on the outcome of
transplantation may not be unexpected, because neither
the agents used for conditioning nor the immune mechanisms involved in graft-versus-leukemia effect are specific
to the sequence of Bcr-Abl; therefore, they would not be
affected by the configuration changes that result from
mutations in the way these may affect the binding or effect
of TKI. However, different mutants may affect the transformation potency of BCR-ABL. It has been reported, for
example, that the tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation at
codon 253 (Y253F) and the glutamic acid-to-lysine mutation at codon 255 (E255K) have increased transformation
potency.30 T315I has significantly inferior kinase activity,
whereas its transformation potency, although variable in
different assays, is grossly equivalent to that of unmutated
Bcr-Abl.30
The results presented here suggest that SCT indeed
represents an effective treatment strategy for patients with
this condition. Although many patients developed recurrent disease, both patients who were treated in CP and 1
additional patient who was treated in second CP have sustained complete molecular responses that have lasted for
14 months, 42 months, and 10 months, respectively. The
finding that the patients who underwent transplantation
in earlier stages had more durable responses is a known
phenomenon and emphasizes the need to consider this
treatment option as soon as this mutation is identified. In
more advanced stages, despite frequent recurrences, some
patients may have transient responses, and recurrences
may be only molecular, which means that SCT still is an
important option to consider. It might be possible to integrate new drugs as they are developed into the SCT strategy, either as part of the conditioning or after
transplantation to minimize the risk of recurrence. It is
noteworthy that, in this report, all patients had unrelated
donor or underwent cord blood transplantation. It would

3636

be expected that results from sibling donors would be at
least equivalent if not better. A patient with this condition
who has a matched sibling should be considered for SCT.
In conclusion, SCT may induce long-term remissions in patients with CML who have developed the
T315I mutation after therapy with TKI. The outcome
depends greatly on the disease stage at the time of transplantation. Thus, patients with CML (ideally in CP) who
develop T315I should be considered for SCT as soon as
this abnormality is discovered if they are eligible for this
procedure.
