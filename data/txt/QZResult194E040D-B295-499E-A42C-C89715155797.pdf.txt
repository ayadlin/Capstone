ABSTRACT
We studied the potential mechanisms of valproic acid (VPA) in the treatment
of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Using the human U87, GBM8401, and DBTRG05MG GBM-derived cell lines, VPA at concentrations of 5 to 20 mM induced G2/M
cell cycle arrest and increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Stress-related molecules such as paraoxonase 2 (PON2), cyclin B1, cdc2, and BclxL were downregulated, but p27, p21 and Bim were upregulated by VPA treatment.
VPA response element on the PON2 promoter was localized at position -400/-1.
PON2 protein expression was increased in GBM cells compared with normal brain
tissue and there was a negative correlation between the expression of PON2 and Bim.
These findings were confirmed by the public Bredel GBM microarray (Gene Expression
Omnibus accession: GSE2223) and the Cancer Genome Atlas GBM microarray datasets.
Overexpression of PON2 in GBM cells significantly decreased intracellular ROS levels,
and PON2 expression was decreased after VPA stimulation compared with controls.
Bim expression was significantly induced by VPA in GBM cells with PON2 silencing.
These observations were further shown in the subcutaneous GBM8401 cell xenograft
of BALB/c nude mice. Our results suggest that VPA reduces PON2 expression in GBM
cells, which in turn increases ROS production and induces Bim production that inhibits
cancer progression via the PON2–Bim cascade.

INTRODUCTION

Valproic acid (VPA) has been widely used in seizure
prophylaxis after neurosurgery including GBM, and the
pharmacokinetics and toxicity of VPA have been well
documented for treating epilepsy [3]. VPA was further
shown to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity
causing impaired epigenetic modification and suppressed
cell growth [4]. Thereafter, the antitumor effects of VPA
were described in vitro and in retrospective clinical studies
[5–11]. Several studies revealed that VPA sensitized GBM
cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy by increased

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
malignant primary brain tumor with infiltrative growth
characteristics. The survival of GBM patients is often
less than 15 months from diagnosis, with the 5-year
survival rate below 10% even after surgery combined with
adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy [1, 2]. Therefore,
an advanced understanding of the molecular mechanism of
GBM progression is essential to improve clinical outcome.

cell apoptosis, which involved increased p21 expression
and cell cycle arrest, suppression of DNA double strand
break repair, and activating pro-apoptotic signaling
[12–16]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) involves tumor
development. Overproduction of ROS and antioxidant
system defect result in DNA repair impairment and gene
expression alteration, contributing to the carcinogenesis
process [17, 18].
The paraoxonase (PON) family belongs to
endogenous free-radical scavenging enzyme system,
which consists of PON1, PON2, and PON3 [19]. The
three highly conserved genes share about 60% to 70%
similarity at the amino acid and nucleotide levels, All
three PON members possess antioxidant properties, but
their tissue distributions and stress responses are different
[19–21]. PON1 and PON3 are found mainly in the liver
and are associated with high-density lipoprotein and
cholesterol levels. PON2 is an intracellular protein that
is expressed extensively in thorax and abdomen tissues,
skeletal muscle, artery wall cells, and macrophages
[22]. Previous studies have shown that people with
impaired PON1 function are at increased risk of cancer
development [23–25]. Overexpression of PON3 protects
cancer cells from mitochondrial superoxide-mediated cell
death [26].
In the present study, we observed that VPA
decreased PON2 expression in GBM-derived cell lines.
Impaired antioxidant genes may be associated with
GBM development, and intracellular PON2 may mediate
anti-apoptosis and maintain the growth of GBM. We
hypothesized that VPA inhibited PON2 in GBM cells and
sensitized GBM cells to oxidative damage and cell death.
Our results indicate that VPA suppresses cell growth via
the PON2–Bim cascade in GBM cells.

cell growth through cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in
GBM cells.

VPA increases ROS production
To investigate the mechanism of VPA-mediated
cell growth suppression in GBM cells, the effect of VPA
on the cell levels of ROS, an important factor in tumor
progression [27], was tested on all three GBM-derived cell
lines. The ROS level was significantly increased in U87
cells treated with 10 mM VPA for 24 to 48 h as assessed
by flow cytometry (Figure 2D). Similarly, significantly
increased ROS levels were observed in the GBM8401
and DBTRG-05MG cells after stimulation with 5 mM
VPA for 24 to 48 h (Figure 2E, 2F). These results indicate
VPA suppresses cell growth via upregulation of ROS
production. Additionally, the migration and invasion
ability were decreased by VPA in U87, GBM8401 and
DBTRG-05MG cells (Supplementary Figure 1A–1F).
However, the cell senescence was not altered with VPA
by evaluating senescence associated β-galactosidase
(SA-βgal) activity [28] in both U87 and GBM8401 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1G). We also analyzed the apoptosis
characterization. The sub-G1 phase was increased by VPA
with PI staining using flow cytometry in U87, GBM8401
and DBTRG-05MG cells (Supplementary Figure 1H).

VPA influences PON2 and cell cycle–related
markers
Based on the above results, we found that cell
proliferation and ROS levels were altered by VPA in GBM
cells. Therefore, we utilized a commercially available
Proteome Profiler Array for cell stress phenotype to
evaluate specific VPA-regulated molecules. Several
molecules, including PON2 and p27, were identified as
potential VPA targets (not shown). The regulation of these
molecules was further validated by Western blotting in
U87, GBM8401, and DBTRG-05MG cells. PON2 was
downregulated and p27 was upregulated at 24 h by VPA
(Figure 3A). Since VPA possesses an anti-cancer effect to
influence tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis [29, 30],
its effect on several additional proliferation and apoptoticrelated molecules, such as cyclin B1, cdc2, p21, Bcl-xL,
and Bim were investigated. Bim and p21 were upregulated
while cyclin B1, cdc2, and Bcl-xL were downregulated
at 24 h by VPA treatment in GBM cells (Figure 3A). The
results suggest that VPA may regulate these molecules to
influence tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Since
PON2 has been identified as an anti-oxidative protein
that decreases intracellular oxidative stress in various cell
types [22, 31] and is ubiquitously expressed in a variety
of tissues and organs [20], PON2 was selected for further
study. Immunohistochemistry of the PON2 expression
level in brain tissue of clinical glioblastoma patients
revealed that PON2 expression was increased in GBM

RESULTS
VPA attenuates GBM cell growth
First, we investigated whether VPA inhibits
GBM cell progression. We treated the U87, GBM8401,
and DBTRG-05MG GBM cell lines with 5, 10, and
20 mM VPA for 24 to 72 h. Using the MTS and
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assays, the cell growth was
reduced significantly by 10 to 20 mM VPA in the U87
cells, and by 5 to 20 mM VPA in the GBM8401 and
DBTRG-05MG cells from 24 to 72 h (Figure 1A–1F).
Thus, these GBM cells were sensitized with VPA in a timeand dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, to evaluate
whether the cell cycle is influenced by VPA, the cell cycle
of GBM was assessed by flow cytometry. As expected, the
cell cycle was arrested at the G2/M phase at 24 and 48 h
in the presence of VPA in U87, GBM8401, and DBTRG05MG cells, indicating that numbers of GBM cells
entering the S phase were significantly reduced (Figure
2A–2C). These observations suggest that VPA decreases

further treated GBM cells with 5 and 10 mM VPA for
24 to 72 h, the PON2 mRNA and protein levels reduced by
VPA was in a dose-dependent manner using RT-PCR and
Western blot (Figure 3C, 3D).

regulated PON2 is affected by HDAC. HDAC decreased
the acetylation of histone H3 [35, 36]. We treated GBM
cells with a HDAC activator, 1-benzoyl-3-phenyl-2thiourea [35, 36], which decreased the expression of
acetyl histone H3 in GBM cells. VPA inhibited HDAC
that increased the expression of acetyl histone H3 in GBM
cells. This effect was attenuated by the simultaneous use
of VPA and 1-benzoyl-3-phenyl-2-thiourea in these cells.
The 1-benzoyl-3-phenyl-2-thiourea did not significantly
alter the PON2 expression compared with control cells.
The PON2 expression was downregulated by VPA,
which was reversed by 1-benzoyl-3-phenyl-2-thiourea in
U87, GBM8401 and DBTRG-05MG cells (Figure 4B).
Additionally, VPA has been shown to be an effective
sensitizing agent in combination with irradiation and
chemotherapy to augmentation of therapeutic efficiency on
glioblastoma [37]. We stimulated glioblastoma with VPA
and temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA alkylating agent, which
has synergistic effect with VPA on Bim upregulation
(Figure 4C). Because TMZ induced DNA methylation and
damage, PON2 downregulation was not observed in TMZ
treatment. TMZ did not have synergistic effect with VPA
on PON2 regulation (Figure 4C).
The finding was further confirmed by examining
the PON2 expression in GBM cells from the public
Bredel GBM microarray dataset (Gene Expression
Omnibus [GEO] accession: GSE2223 [38]). From the
dataset report, the mean PON2 mRNA level was higher
in 30 GBM specimens compared with 4 normal subjects
(Figure 4D). Although the public database displayed only
4 normal subjects, the average PON2 level in glioblastoma

VPA inhibits PON2 at the transcriptional level
Next, we investigated the PON2 regulation
mechanism by VPA. The reporter assay was performed to
determine the position and clarify the regulatory effects
of VPA on PON2 at the transcriptional level. The PON2
5′-flanking region encompassing nucleotides -1000/-1
(relative to the transcription initiation site) (Figure 4A)
was cloned and inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter
gene in pA3TK-luc (construct p1) to generate construct p2.
The pA3TK-luc construct contained a minimum
thymidine kinase promoter. Serial deletion fragments were
additionally constructed (Figure 4A). The transcriptional
activities of the PON2 promoter fragments are illustrated
in Figure 4A. Among these, only the p5 construct was
repressed about 2-fold by VPA in U87 and GBM8401
cells (Figure 4A). These findings suggest that VPA inhibits
PON2 at the transcriptional level between position -400/-1
(p5) in glioblastoma.

VPA attenuates glioblastoma growth via PON2
regulation
VPA has been shown to possess HDAC inhibitor
activity [11], hence we investigated whether the VPA-

(BrdU) (D–F) assays. The cell proliferation is significantly decreased in GBM cells using VPA in different doses. The data shown are from
three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Error bars: SD. Values are shown as absorbance of VPA-treated cells relative to

patients was about 2.3-fold that of normal subjects
(3.75 vs 1.66; Figure 4D). Moreover, this phenomenon
was further observed in 473 GBM specimens from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM microarray database
[32] (Figure  4E). To investigate whether the effects of
VPA in vitro could be applied in vivo, we established a
subcutaneous xenograft of GBM8401 cells in BALB/c nude
mice. Subsequently, nude mice were injected with PBS or
VPA (400 mg/kg) intraperitoneally every two days for 60
days [40, 41]. Tumor sizes from the two groups (PBS and
VPA) of mice are shown in Figure 4F. The tumor growth
of PBS group was initially detected at 14 days, but in VPA
group was about 30 days. Tumors sizes of mice injected
with PBS were two-fold larger than those of VPA-injected
mice (Figure 4F). VPA can inhibit glioblastoma growth in
vivo. In the study of mouse xenograft, the PON2 expression
was downregulated and Bim expression upregulated by
VPA in tumors of GBM8401 cells as shown by Western
blotting and immunohistochemistry (Figure 4G, 4H).

To determine whether PON2 inhibits ROS
production in GBM cells, the ROS level was assessed in
PON2-overexpressed GBM cells transiently transfected
with PON2 cDNA. The basal expression level of PON2
in U87, GBM8401,  and  DBTRG-05MG was shown in
Supplemental Figure 2. The expression level of PON2
protein in U87 and GBM8401 cells was increased after
PON2 overexpression (Figure 5A, 5C). The ROS level
was significantly reduced in PON2-overexpressed cells
stimulated with VPA compared with controls in the U87
and GBM8401 cells using flow cytometry (Figure 5B, 5D).
Furthermore, we established two transient PON2-silenced
GBM cells (U87 and GBM8401) in which PON2 protein
expression was decreased (Figure 5E, 5G). The ROS level
was significantly higher in PON2-silenced cells in the
presence of VPA compared with controls (Figure 5F, 5H).
These findings indicate that PON2 influences ROS

and the expression level was attenuated in the PON2overexpressed cells with VPA treatment compared with
controls (Figure 6A, 6B, lanes 2 vs 4). Similar effects were
observed in PON2-silenced U87 and GBM8401 cells. The
expression level of PON2 protein in U87 and GBM8401
cells was silenced (Figure 6C, 6D, lanes 1 vs 3).
Furthermore, the expression of PON2 was decreased after
VPA stimulation (Figure 6C, 6D, lanes 1 vs 2, lanes 3 vs 4).
Bim expression was activated by VPA in both controls and
PON2-silenced cells (Figure 6C, 6D, lanes 1 vs 2, lanes
3 vs 4), and the levels were increased in PON2-silenced
cells compared with controls in U87 and GBM8401 cells
(Figure 6C, 6D, lanes 2 vs 4). To investigate whether the
Bim regulation is specific in VPA-mediated reducing cell
proliferation, we further silenced Bim expression in GBM
cells. The Bim expression was efficiently suppressed. The
decrease in cell proliferation was abrogated in the Bimsilenced (Bim KD) condition compared with the vectorcontrol cells in the VPA stimulation in U87 and GBM8401
cells (Figure 6E, 6F). Hence we suggest the Bim is specific
in the PON2-Bim pathway of VPA-mediated reducing
GBM cell proliferation.

VPA increases tumor cell ROS production
through PON2–Bim signaling
To investigate the downstream signaling pathway
involved in PON2-mediated glioblastoma cell growth
arrest, we established two transient PON2-transfectants
overexpressing PON2 in U87 and GBM8401 cells. The
expression level of PON2 protein in these transfected
U87 and GBM8401 cells was increased compared to
levels present in the vector-control cells (Figure 6A, 6B,
lanes 1 vs 3). PON2 protein was, however, decreased
after stimulation with VPA in the U87 and GBM8401
cells transfected by vector, but not in the PON2
-overexpressed transfectants (Figure 6A, 6B, lanes 1
vs 2, lanes 3 vs 4). We speculate that the expression of
PON2 was saturated in PON2-overexpressed cells, hence
the PON2 level was not significantly altered after VPA
treatment. However, the level of Bim was elevated after
VPA treatment (Figure 6A, 6B, lanes 1 vs 2, lanes 3 vs 4),

DISCUSSION

To confirm the clinical significance of the PON2–Bim
axis, we determined whether the observed expression
values between the PON2 and Bim molecules could be
applied in human GBM. The expression levels of the
PON2 and Bim genes were retrieved from the published
TCGA GBM microarray dataset. The mRNA expression
levels of PON2 and Bim in the individuals were
significantly different in 473 GBM specimens (Figure 6G),
which further revealed PON2 and Bim were significantly
inversely correlated (Figure 6H). Taking the data together,
we suggest that VPA attenuation of GBM cell proliferation
may involve significant upregulation of ROS production
via the PON2–Bim cascade.

Here we have shown that cell proliferation is
reduced by VPA in U87, GBM8401, and DBTRG-05MG
cells. VPA suppresses GBM cell growth via the
upregulation of ROS production. PON2 overexpression
and silencing influence ROS production in GBM cells. VPA
appears to increase ROS production via the PON2–Bim
cascade, leading to cancer cell death.
Our study demonstrated that VPA suppressed
the growth of GBM-derived cell lines and induced cell
cycle arrest in a time- and dose-dependent manner. ROS
level was increased in GBM cells after VPA treatment.

Figure 4: Valproic acid (VPA) inhibits PON2 expression in vitro and in vivo. (A) U87 and GBM8401 cells were

transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the PON2 5ʹ-flanking region (position -1001 to -1) with or without pA3TKluc. Promoter activities were calculated, relative to 0 nM VPA (+VPA/-VPA), and further normalized to the pA3TK-luc control as
well as β-galactosidase activity (VPA-induced changes were normalized to that of β-gal). VPA decreases PON2 expression at position

The glioblastoma cells were pre-treated with a HDAC activator, 1-benzoyl-3-phenyl-2-thiourea (HA, 20 μM) for 1 h followed by VPA
(U87, 10 mM; GBM8401 and DBTRG-05MG, 5 mM) treatment 24 h. The acetyl histone H3 expression, an acetylation histone protein
regulated by HDAC, was not increased as that by VPA. The HA did not significantly alter the PON2 expression compared with control
cells. The PON2 expression was downregulated by VPA, which was abrogated by HA in U87, GBM8401 and DBTRG-05MG cells.
(C) The glioblastoma cells were treated with VPA (U87, 10 mM; GBM8401 and DBTRG-05MG, 5 mM) and temozolomide (TMZ, 40 μM)
for 24 hours, which has synergistic effect with VPA on Bim upregulation. PON2 downregulation was not observed in TMZ treatment. TMZ
did not have synergistic effect with VPA on PON2 regulation. (D, E) PON2 mRNA expression was analyzed in 30 GBM specimens and
4 normal subjects from the Oncomine public Bredel GBM microarray dataset (GEO accession: GSE2223 [38]) (D) and 473 specimens from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM microarray database (E). The PON2 level is significantly higher in GBM patients compared with
normal controls. (F) The nude mice received subcutaneous xenograft with GBM8401 cells (5 × 107) were intraperitoneal injections of PBS
(n = 3) or VPA (400 mg/kg; n = 3) every two days for 60 days. The tumor sizes were measured up to 60 days after inoculation of tumor cells.

Results from protein array analysis revealed the possible
mechanisms of inhibitory effects of VPA on GBM cells.
These included elevated p27, resulting in cell proliferation
suppression and reduced cyclin B1/cdc2, which in turn
results in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase [42], decreased
levels of pro-survival Bcl2 and increased pro-apoptotic
Bim proteins, which could then result in cell death [43].
Hence, VPA influence may inhibit GBM progression
through changes in proliferation and apoptosis.
VPA has been identified as an HDAC inhibitor
influencing tumor cell apoptosis, differentiation, and
proliferation [29, 30]. Moreover, ROS is an important
factor implicated in tumor progression [27]. We also
showed that VPA augmented ROS production in GBM
cells thus supporting a potential role of VPA in cell growth
suppression through the upregulation of ROS production.
A decrease of the anti-oxidant PON2 protein was
also detected after using VPA. This deceased PON2
expression could potentiate the cytotoxic effects of ROS
and enhance VPA-induced cell cycle arrest. The use of the
model of transfectants overexpressing PON2 provided
further support for the VPA-induced GBM cell growth
suppression being mediated by increased ROS production
and that the effect was augmented by decreased PON2.
In a study of non-Hispanic whites, an increased
risk of glioma was associated with the single nucleotide
polymorphism of SOD3 [45]. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms in SOD2, SOD3, GPX1, and NOS1
were found to significantly increase the risk of glioma
development in a Chinese population. These data suggest
that oxidative stress gene variation might contribute
to the etiology of glioma [46]. PON2 was identified in

subcellular mitochondrial fractions [31]. PON2 is able
to inhibit the generation of mitochondrial superoxide and
apoptosis [47]. We observed that GBM cells expressed a
higher PON2 protein level compared with normal brain
tissue, providing additional support for the importance of
PON2 for cancer cell survival.
In agreement with our findings, overexpression of
PON2 is observed in solid cancers derived from prostate,
liver, pancreas, kidney, lung and thymus [48–50], and
T-cell leukemia virus-infected lymphocytes [51]. Kang
et al. reported that upregulation of PON2 can be used
as a predictor for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with
poor prognosis [52]. PON2 accelerates chemoresistance
in leukemia cells, and silencing PON2 has resulted in
spontaneous apoptosis in various human cancer cells
[50]. In keeping with the above observations, our results
support PON2 as a tumor promoter via the downregulation
of ROS production.
VPA is a relatively weak HDAC inhibitor with
activity at millimolar concentrations [53]. The docking and
molecular dynamic simulations showed that HDAC
inhibited by VPA was through the carboxyl group of
VPA coordinating with Zn atom and other local residues
(H141-142 and Y360) located at the catalytic site of
HDAC. VPA bound with highest affinity at a site located
at the acetyl-releasing channel [54]. VPA, either in in vitro
studies or phase I/II clinical trials, also demonstrated cell
growth inhibition effects on both benign cells, such as
vascular pericytes, and cancers, such as acute myeloid
leukemia and solid malignancies [39, 56]. As the clinical
kinetics and bioavailability of VPA are well established,
it has promise as an anticancer agent indicated for a

vector-control cells, the effect is reduced in PON2-overexpressed cells (B, D). The ROS levels in PON2-silenced cells with VPA (10 mM)
treatment are higher than that of vector-control cells with VPA treatment (F, H). Control: cells transfected with empty vector only; KD:

reduction of glioma growth either as mono-therapy or as
part of a combined treatment. Previous reports have shown
that VPA synergistically interacts with chemotherapy or
radiotherapy to enhance cytotoxicity in GBM cells by
promoting HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression
and histone hyperacetylation in vitro and in vivo, which
improves survival in GBM patients [12, 56–62]. Tsai et
al. displayed that VPA may be efficacious for GBM with
increased histone acetylation, and early administration of
VPA for patients within 2 weeks of diagnosis as an adjunct
to temozolomide chemotherapy may benefit survival [63].
GBM patients treated with VPA had a significantly longer
survival than those who had received other anti-epileptic
drugs [11], and VPA may be preferred in patients with
glioblastoma who require an anti-epileptic drug during
temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy [37, 64, 65]. For
example, patients treated with VPA in combination with
temozolomide had a median survival for 69 weeks, longer
than those without VPA treatment (61 weeks, p = 0.016)
[61]. Patients taking VPA had a more favorable median
overall survival in (16.9 months), compared to those taking
other anti-epileptic drugs (13.6 months, p = 0.016) [66].
Our data demonstrate that VPA may suppress
GBM cell growth in GBM-derived cell lines through
the upregulation of ROS production via the PON2–Bim
signaling pathway. In the present study, the selected 5 to
10 mM concentration of VPA (molecular weight 144.21)
used in in vitro is equivalent to 10-times therapeutic serum
level of VPA in human (50–125 µg/mL; the toxic level is

greater than 150 µg/mL) [67]. Such a concentration for
in vitro study could be much lower than true therapeutic level
in a culture dish, because of the protein binding proportion
was neglected. So, effective dose of valproic acid for
in vitro study may require higher dose to exhibit cytotoxic
effects. The higher dose of VPA for in vivo study refers to
the previous reports [40, 41]. However, humans cannot
tolerate high doses of VPA. High-dose VPA experimental
data contribute to the clinical efficacy of the drug, which
may direct treatments using combination treatment with
radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or design other drug
formulations in patients. VPA may, thus, represent a
potential important therapeutic agent for the treatment
for malignant glioma. Further work is needed to study the
clinical prognosis of GBM patients treated with VPA to
reveal if the PON2 can also be used as a diagnostic marker
for predicting therapeutic effect of VPA on GBM patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human glioblastoma cell lines U87, Denver
Brain Tumor Research Group 05MG (DBTRG-05MG;
ATCC, Manassas, VA) , and GBM8401 (Bioresource
Collection Research Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan) were
routinely cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and

Figure 6: PON2-Bim cascade is involved in VPA-increased ROS. The expression levels of PON2 and Bim were determined
by Western blot after VPA stimulation in U87 (A, C) and GBM8401 (B, D) cells in both PON2-overexpressed (PON2) (A, B) and PON2silenced (PON2 KD) (C, D) conditions. The expression of Bim in VPA treated PON2-overexpressed cells is lower than that of VPA treated
vector-control cells (A, B; lanes 2 vs 4). The levels of Bim in VPA-treated PON2-silenced cells is higher than that in VPA-treated vectorcontrol cells (C, D; lanes 2 vs 4). (E, F) The Bim expression and cell proliferation were determined by Western blot and MTS assay after
VPA stimulation in U87 and GBM8401 cells with Bim-silenced (Bim KD) condition. The decreasing cell proliferation was abrogated in the
Bim-silenced (Bim KD) condition compared with the vector-control cells in the VPA stimulation cells (G, H) The mRNA levels of PON2
and Bim were analyzed in 473 specimens from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM microarray database [32]. The mRNA expression
levels of PON2 and Bim in the individuals were significantly different in 473 GBM specimens. The PON2 level is inversely correlated with
Bim (Pearson r = –0.236, p < 0.001). Control: cells transfected with empty vector only; C; cells without VPA treatment; KD: knockdown.

In vitro migration and invasion assays

Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI
1640; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Hyclone, Road Logan, UT).

The influence of VPA on glioblastoma motility was
determined as described previously [34]. Briefly, 100 μL
cell suspension (1 × 105 cells/ml) was seeded on upper
chambers of either non-Matrigel-coated (migration) or
Matrigel-coated (invasion; BD Biosciences, San Diego,
CA) Transwell with 8-μm-pore size (Falcon BD, Franklin
Lakes, New Jersey). The medium in the upper chamber
was serum-free medium, whereas the lower chamber
medium contained 10% FBS. After incubation for 24 h at
37°C, the cells traversing the filter from the upper to lower
chamber were examined via cell counting. Experiments
were performed at least three times.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation rates were examined using the
(3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) assay (Promega,
Madison, WI). Cells (2 × 103) were seeded on 96-well
plates overnight. After 6 h starvation, cells were treated
with various doses of VPA (2–20 mM) for 48–72 h, and
20 μL MTS solution (10× dilution of 5 mg/mL MTS in
DMEM without serum) was added to each well for 3 h at
37°C. Finally, absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a
SpectraMax microplate reader.

Cell senescence assay
The senescence assay is to analyze the SA-βgal
activity [28]. The U87 and GBM8401 cells (2 × 105 cells)
were seeded on 6-well plate. After stimulation with
10 mM VPA for 24 h, cells were washed with PBS twice
and fixed with 3.7 % formaldehyde for 10 min at room
temperature, followed by staining with SA-βgal staining
solution (5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium
ferrocyanide, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 mg/mL
X-gal) overnight at 37°C. The blue SA-βgal positive cells
were defined as senescent cells.

BrdU assay
A BrdU incorporation assay was performed
using a Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU Kit (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, the U87, GBM8401 and
DBTRG-05MG cells were cultured in 96-well plates
at a density of 5000 cells/100 μL/well in a complete
growth medium. After stimulating with VPA for 24
to 72 h, the cells were labelled using 100 μL BrdU
(1:1000) per well and incubated for 18 h that followed
by the procedures as manufacturer’s instructions. The
reaction was quantified by measuring the absorbance
using a scanning multi-well spectrophotometer (Tecan,
Mannedorf, Switzerland) at 450 nm, with a reference
wavelength of 540 nm.

Proteome ProfilerTM Array (human cell stress
array kit)
U87 cells were either treated with 10 μM VPA
for 24 h or left untreated. The cell lysates of U87 were
incubated with a Proteome Profiler Array to study cell
stress phenotype overnight at 4°C. The array included
carbonic anhydrase IX, cited-2, cytochrome C, dickkopf
Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor 4, fatty acid binding
protein 1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, heat shock
protein (HSP) 60, HSP70, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal
kinase, nuclear factor–kappaB, p21, p27, PON1, PON2,
thioredoxin-1, silent mating type information regulation
2 homolog, and superoxide dismutase 2. The array
membrane was washed, followed by incubation with
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase buffer for 30 min at
room temperature. Subsequently, the intensity of molecules
on the membrane was examined by the chemiluminescence
method using a chemiluminescence detection kit
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).

Flow cytometry studies on cell cycle and
apoptosis
U87, GBM8401, and DBTRG-05MG cells were
fixed in ethanol/PBS (7:3, v/v) for 1 h at­ –20°C. Cells
were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min and pellets
were stained with propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) in 250 μL PBS (0.5% Triton X-100)
containing 0.125 mg DNase-free RNase A (Roche, South
San Francisco, CA) and 6.25 μg PI (Sigma-Aldrich) for
15 min at 4°C in the dark. The cell cycle was examined by
flow cytometry. Data were collected and analyzed using
FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) running
CellQuest software.

ROS detection

Western blot analysis

Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS
with RedoxSensor Red CC-1 (Molecular probes, Eugene,
OR) for 15 min at room temperature. The ROS level was
then determined by flow cytometry using RedoxSensor™
Red CC-1 kit (Molecular Probes) as manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cells were treated with VPA (5–10 mM), 1-benzoyl3-phenyl-2-thiourea (HDAC activator, 20 μM, SigmaAldrich) and temozolomide (TMZ, 40 μM, Sigma- Aldrich)
as the indicated times. Total cell lysate 20-μg proteins
were fractionated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred

at room temperature. Finally, immune complexes were
visualized using the chemiluminescence method with a
chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).

to determine the transcriptional activities of the PON2
promoter. At the end of the treatment period, cells were
lysed, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were
measured. Luciferase activity was normalized against that
of β-galactosidase. The primers were displayed in Table 1.

Oncomine® database
Oncomine is a cancer microarray database and
integrated data platform available at www.oncomine.
org. The Bredel GBM microarray dataset in Oncomine
was searched using the criteria of the PON2 gene and
glioblastoma cell.

Immunohistochemistry

TCGA database

Usage of archived formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue block was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of MacKay Memorial Hospital. Tissue
slides from glioblastoma patients were evaluated by
immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin/eosin staining
using polyclonal antibody against PON2 (LifeSpan
BioSciences) through the avidin-biotin complex method,
as described previously [33]. Immunoreactivity for PON2
was visualized using DAB/nickel substrate (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).

TCGA is public and comprehensive databases
that consists of various cancer types [32]. We searched
the glioblastoma microarray database containing 473
biospecimens from the Data Coordinating Center of
TCGA to analyze the PON2 and Bim expression levels.

Animal study
The BALB/c nude mice (Jackson Immuno
Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were inoculated
subcutaneously with GBM8401 cells (5 × 107 cells) mixed
with 100 μl Matrigel TM (5 mg/mL, BD Biosciences), to
enhance tumor growth ability in nude mice [55]. After
1 day of the implantation, VPA (400 mg/kg) [40, 41]
or PBS was injected intraperitoneally every two days
for 60 days, and PBS group were used as control. Once
palpable tumors were established after the inoculation, the
tumor xenografts were measured with two dimensions by
caliper every two days. These nude mice were sacrificed
at 60 days after tumor inoculation. Tumor volume was
calculated by the following equation: length × height ×
width (mm3). The Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Mackay Memorial Hospital approved
the use of animals in this study.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA of glioblastoma cells was extracted using
the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and cDNA
was synthesized using oligodeoxythymidine (Promega,
Madison, WI) and a Superscript II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen). The cDNA was ampliﬁed via PCR for
30  cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 58°C for 1 min, and 72°C
for 1 min. 18s rRNA was used as an internal control. PCR
products were checked by 1% agarose gel (Amresco, Solon,
OH) electrophoresis. The primers were displayed in Table 1.

Cloning and activities of PON2 promoter
fragments
The PON2 promoter (positions -1001 to -1, relative
to the transcription initiation site) were ligated into the
pA3TK vector, based on the published sequence. Several
serial deletion fragments of the PON2 promoter were
amplified via PCR and cloned into the pA3TK vector. The
constructed promoter sequences were confirmed using
automatic DNA sequencing. U87 and GBM8401 cells were
cotransfected with 0.3 μg DNA/well of pA3TK vector
containing the PON2 promoter sequence and 0.3 μg of SVβ
plasmid, a β-galactosidase expression vector (Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA), followed by treated with 10 and 5 mM
VPA for 24 h in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent following manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cloning of PON2
Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using
Superscript Ⅱ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and
oligodeoxythymidine to synthesize template cDNA.
The PON2 cDNA was amplified via a polymerase chain
reaction for 30 cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 58°C for 1 min,
and 72°C for 1 min. The PON2 open reading frame was
ligated into a pcDNA 3.0 expression vector (Promega)
and the resulting construct was sequenced to confirm
the presence of the gene. The PON2 open reading frame
primers were displayed in Table1.

Establishment of U87 and GBM8401 cell lines
transiently overexpressing PON2

Statistical analysis
All values are reported as mean ± SD. Differences
were evaluated by Student᾽s t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank
test, when appropriate. In search for bivariate correlations,
this investigation used Pearson’s correlation analysis and
scatter plot for two continuous variables. P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

The U87 and GBM8401 cells were transiently
transfected with the PON2 cDNA construct in 6-cm cell
culture dishes using serum free Opti-MEMi medium and
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent following manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the medium of
the transfected cells was replaced with regular medium.
Subsequently, the expression of PON2 protein in U87
and GBM8401 cells was examined using Western blot
analysis. PON2 cDNA was constructed into pcDNA
3.0 expression vector (Promega), hence, pcDNA 3.0
(Promega) was used as vector control.

TRCN0000051644 of short hairpin (sh)RNA targeting
PON2 were purchased from the National RNAi Core
Facility (Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica,
Taiwan). The sequence of targeting PON2 was constructed
into pLKO.1 vector (Academia Sinica), which was used as
vector control. Transfection of siRNA or shRNA against the
endogenous Bim and PON2 genes in U87 and GBM8401
cells were transiently performed using Lipofectamine 2000
