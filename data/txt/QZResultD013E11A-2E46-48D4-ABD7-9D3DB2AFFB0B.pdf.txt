ABSTRACT
Despite recent therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma (MM) is still an incurable
neoplasia due to intrinsic or acquired resistance to therapy. Myeloma cell localization
in the bone marrow milieu allows direct interactions between tumor cells and nontumor bone marrow cells which promote neoplastic cell growth, survival, bone
disease, acquisition of drug resistance and consequent relapse. Twenty percent of
MM patients are at high-risk of treatment failure as defined by tumor markers or
presentation as plasma cell leukemia. Cumulative evidences indicate a key role of
Notch signaling in multiple myeloma onset and progression. Unlike other Notchrelated malignancies, where the majority of patients carry gain-of-function mutations
in Notch pathway members, in MM cell Notch signaling is aberrantly activated due
to an increased expression of Notch receptors and ligands; notably, this also results
in the activation of Notch signaling in surrounding stromal cells which contributes
to myeloma cell proliferation, survival and migration, as well as to bone disease and
intrinsic and acquired pharmacological resistance. Here we review the last findings on
the mechanisms and the effects of Notch signaling dysregulation in MM and provide
a rationale for a therapeutic strategy aiming at inhibiting Notch signaling, along with
a complete overview on the currently available Notch-directed approaches.

in each patient (Figure 1). MM may be preceded by a
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS), an indolent, asymptomatic, premalignant
phase characterized by a small clonal population (<10%)
of PCs within the BM. MGUS may progress to MM at
a rate of 1% per year. Intramedullary MM may present
as an asymptomatic, smoldering, multiple myeloma
(SMM), or associated with organ dysfunction including
hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone disease.
SMM has an average risk of progression to MM of 10%
per year [3,4]. The final stage of MM is represented by
the plasma cell leukemia (PCL), defined as at least 20%
of PCs or an absolute PCs count of more than 2 × 109/L
in the peripheral blood. PCL is a rapidly progressive and

MULTIPLE MYELOMA
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematological
malignancy characterized by a malignant proliferation
of bone marrow (BM) post-germinal center plasma
cells (PCs) and release of monoclonal protein in blood
or urine. MM accounts for 1% of all neoplastic disease
and represents 13% of hematologic cancers. In Western
countries, its annual incidence is approximately 5.6 cases
per 100.000 individuals. The median age at diagnosis is
about 70 years [1, 2].
MM represents a highly biologically and clinically
heterogeneous neoplasia; it shows four distinguishable
clinical phases that, however, may not be discernible

step in the development of this disease, since it supports
tumor growth and survival and finally contributes to the
development of drug resistance [13, 14].
High incidence of bone lesions in MM patients
is due to the ability of malignant PCs to alter the ratio
between osteoclasts (OCLs) and osteoblasts (OBLs)
in favor of the first [13, 15]. This effect is mediated by
an increase of BM-associated anti-osteoblastogenic
factors, such as DKK1, IL3, IL7 and TGF-β [11], or
pro-osteoclastogenic factors, such as TNFα and RANKL
[16, 17, 18]. Importantly, MM cells play a key role in
inducing bone disease directly or indirectly, i.e. MM cells
may autonomously produce RANKL [16] or stimulate
the surrounding BM cells to release RANKL and other
soluble factors that promote OCL differentiation [18].
OCLs directly support MM cell proliferation and survival,
leading to disease progression [19].
Thus, malignant transformation in MM represents
a multistep process due to accumulating genetic and
epigenetic alterations of PCs as well as to their aberrant
interactions with BM microenvironment.
The use of novel therapeutic agents such as
immunomodulators (i.e. thalidomide and lenalidomide)
and proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), as well as the
incorporation of high-dose chemotherapy followed
by autologous stem cell transplantation represents the
current therapy for MM patients up to 65 years old,
without comorbidities and organ dysfunction [1, 20,
21]. Conventional chemotherapy (such as melphalan)
combined with novel therapeutic drugs is generally
administered in patients older than 65 years or unfit [22].
Recently, two different groups of new generation drugs

fatal disease which may occur as secondary (sPCL) in
the context of a preexisting refractory MM, or primary
(pPCL) if presenting de novo in leukemic phase [5,6].
In the last decade, important advances in molecular
cytogenetics and global genomic studies of myeloma cells
and their normal counterparts have allowed a significant
progress in understanding MM pathogenesis, providing
the basis for a molecular prognostic classification and the
identification of novel potential therapeutic targets. MM
is characterized by a profound genomic instability that
involves both ploidy and structural rearrangements. Nearly
half of MM tumors are defined as hyperdiploid (HD)
associated with trisomies of odd chromosomes (including
3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21). The remaining tumors are
referred as non-hyperdiploid and are frequently associated
with the constitutive activation of CCND1 (11q13),
CCND3 (6p21), MAF (16q23), MAFB (20q11), or FGFR3/
MMSET (4p16.3) genes as a result of IGH translocations.
Generally, HD patients have a better prognosis [7, 8].
Recent data based on whole exome/genome sequencing
indicated a heterogeneous pattern of gene mutations in
MM, frequently involving member of the ERK pathway
(NRAS, KRAS or BRAF) and, at a lesser extent, other genes
such as DIS3 or FAM46c [8–11].
MM is associated with bone disease in more than
80% of MM patients, due to osteoclast-mediated bone
destruction which causes hypercalcemia, osteoporosis,
bone pain and fractures [12]. In particular, up to 70% of
patients have vertebral fractures, which are associated
with a high impairment of quality of life, morbidity and
mortality [12]. Bone resorption is not only a relevant issue
for patients quality of life, but represents also a critical

have been developed; these include novel proteasome
inhibitors (carfilzomib, ixazomib and marizomib)
and drugs with novel mechanisms of action such as
monoclonal antibodies, specific inhibitors of signaling
pathways and kinases, deacetylase inhibitors and agents
activating the unfolded protein response, especially Hsp90
inhibitors [23]. Nowadays, the median overall survival of
MM patients is 7–8 years [1].
However, despite the recent remarkable
improvements in the treatment of patients and the
development of investigational platforms, MM remains
still incurable mainly because of intrinsic or acquired
drug resistance. MM cells localization in the BM milieu
allows the direct interaction with non-tumor BM cells
that provide several stimuli promoting neoplastic cell
growth and drug resistance, and consequently patient’s
relapse [24]. In addition, approximately twenty percent of
patients at diagnosis are at high-risk of treatment failure
defined by prognostic markers or due to presentation
as PCL. The following chromosomal aberrations
have been associated with an adverse outcome:
i) translocation t(4;14) in 15% patients, which deranges
the expression of FGFR3 (a receptor tyrosine kinase)
and multiple myeloma SET domain (MMSET; a histone
methyltransferase acting as a transcriptional corepressor);
ii) translocations t(14;16) and t(14;20) which affects
approximately 6% patients resulting in the upregulation
of oncogenes c-MAF and MAFB, respectively; iii) the
deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p)
observed in 10% of newly diagnosed MM patients and
increasing with MM progression, which results in the loss
of TP53 hampering its role in the control of cell cycle and
survival; iv) the gain of the long arm of chromosome 1
which is found in approximately 40% of patients at onset
and results in gene amplification of PDZK1, CKS1B and
ADAR1 [7–9]. It has been shown that PDZK1 plays a
role in conferring drug resistance to MM cells, whereas
CSK1B promotes MM cell proliferation and drug
resistance through JAK/STAT3 and MEK/ERK [25].
ADAR1 may play a role in tumor progression through
its activities of RNA editing, microRNA processing
and RNA-induced gene silencing, possibly resulting in
malignant reprogramming [26–27].

proteolytic cleavages, the release of the cytoplasmic portion
and the translocation to the nucleus of the active form of
Notch (intra-cellular Notch, ICN) [29].
The Notch pathway regulates cell differentiation,
apoptosis, proliferation, morphogenesis and it is
essential for embryonic development of multicellular
organisms [30]. Specifically, in mammals Notch is able
to regulate various processes such as vasculogenesis,
myogenesis, gliogenesis, neurogenesis and hematopoiesis
[29]. Moreover, the Notch pathway is also involved
in the homeostasis of adult tissues by regulating cell
differentiation [30], promoting stem cells self-renewal [31]
and determining cell fate choice in tissue development,
including the commitment to T and B cell lineages [32].
The involvement of Notch signaling in the regulation of
these important processes may explain the occurrence
of the deregulation of Notch receptors or ligands in
several types of cancer, including solid (i.e. breast cancer,
melanoma, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, pancreatic
cancer) [33] and hematologic tumors (i.e. T-ALL, B-ALL,
AML, B-CLL, MM) [34–37].

THE NOTCH PATHWAY: A KEY
MEDIATOR OF MM PROGRESSION
Notch signaling dysregulation in MM can be
ascribed to the overexpression of both receptors and
ligands (Table 1). In particular, immunohistochemical
analyses revealed that Notch1, Notch2 and Jagged1
are highly expressed in primary MM cells compared to
low/undetectable levels in non-neoplastic counterparts
[38]. Furthermore the increase of Notch1 and Jagged1
expression was reported upon disease progression
from MGUS to MM [39]. NOTCH2 gene expression
levels and activity were reported to be increased in the
group of MM patients (approximately 6%) carrying the
translocations t(14;16)(q32;q23) and t(14;20)(q32;q11)
[40]. These translocations result in the activation of two
transcription factors (C-MAF and MAFB respectively),
responsible of NOTCH2 transcription [40]. Jagged2
deregulation seems an even more essential step in
MM pathogenesis since its overexpression is an early
event occurring in the benign MGUS phase [41]. The
mechanisms involved in Jagged2 dysregulation are
complex and include Jagged2 promoter hypomethylation
[41], the aberrant expression of Skeletrophin, an
Ubiquitin-ligase necessary for Jagged2 activity [42],
and the loss of SMRT/NCoR2 corepressor which
results in Jagged2 promoter acetylation and increased
transcription [43].
Finally, with regard to Notch signaling dysregulation
in MM, it can be noted that “hyperdiploid” cases are
associated with trisomies of different chromosomes [44] at
which genes belonging to Notch pathway, such as NOTCH1
(chr.9q34.3), NOTCH3 (19p13.2–p13.1), DLL3 (19q13),
DLL4 (15q14), MAML1 (5q35), and MAML2 (11q21), are

NOTCH SIGNALING PATHWAY
A strain of Drosophila characterized by wings
with irregular, “notched” margins was discovered in
1919 and lately associated to haploinsufficiency in the
Notch gene [28]. In mammals, the Notch family of
genes is composed by four transmembrane receptors,
characterized by highly homologue sequences (Notch1–4),
and two closely related families of membranebound ligands: the Delta-like ligands (DLL1, 3, 4)
and the Serrate-like ligands (Jagged1 and 2) [29]. The
interaction between receptors and ligands induces two

located. Moreover, high levels of HES5, a direct Notch
transcriptional target [45], have been reported in the
subgroup of LB patients (low bone disease) [44]. Although
these evidences suggest a possible increase of Notch activity
in these tumors, they should be further corroborated by a
thorough molecular analysis of the expression of Notch
signaling members in MM patients subgroups.
The first outcome of Notch receptors and ligands
dysregulation in MM is the activation of Notch signaling
within tumor cell due to homotypic interaction among
nearby myeloma cells or to the engagement of Notch
receptors by ligands expressed on the surrounding stromal
cells (see scheme in Figure 2). Several reports indicate that
Notch inhibition in MM cells induces apoptosis, decreases
proliferation rate [46, 47] and increases their sensitivity to
pro-apoptotic compounds such as Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitors
[48]. Moreover, Notch blockade causes an increase of
MM cells sensitivity to standard chemotherapics such
as doxorubicin and melphalan both in vitro and in vivo,
finally preventing the development of BM-derived drug
resistance [47]. We also showed a role for Notch in the
directional migration of MM cell [46] in analogy to other
healthy and neoplastic cell types [49–52]. In particular,
Notch signaling controls the expression and function of
the CXCR4/SDF1α chemokine system, which is crucial
in malignant PC growth, survival and migration [46].
Accordingly, in vivo inhibition of Notch activity in a
xenograft murine model of MM results in the reduction
of CXCR4 expression in MM cells and in a consequent
significant decrease of MM cell localization to the BM, the
primary source of SDF1α chemokine [46]. The evidence
that Notch signaling dysregulation may drive MM cell
localization at the BM strongly suggests that the increase
of Notch signaling activity during MM progression may
promote the continuous migration of MM cells from the
initially infiltrated BM site to different bone districts,
resulting in the formation of multiple bone lesions.
In the last years, another crucial role for Notch
signaling has been reported in cancer stem cell selfwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

renewal [53]. The proposed involvement of MM stem
cells (MMSCs) in drug resistance, tumor dormancy
and relapse has drawn the attention of the scientific
community on the identification of specific MMSC
markers. Unfortunately, up to now, there are not univocal
MMSC markers. Indeed, it is still a matter of debate
whether MMSCs originate from B cells, and therefore can
be identified as CD138−CD19+CD20+ cells [53], or if
they derive from mature plasma cells, which can be found
in the CD138+ population [55]. Moreover it cannot be
excluded that different MMSC subpopulations rise during
MM progression. Even though the lack of unambiguous
markers makes the study of MMSCs difficult, a role of
Notch signaling in MMSCs has been described on the
basis of functional assays [56, 57]. Xu and colleagues
reported that MS5 stromal cell line, genetically modified
to have a high constitutive expression of human DLL1,
increased human and murine MM cells clonogenic
growth in vitro and accelerated disease development in
the 5T33MM murine model [56]. Chiron et al. reported
that Jagged2 is critical for MM cell self-renewal, showing
that spontaneous clonogenic growth of MM cell lines
correlated with the expression of Jagged2, whereas on the
other end, clonogenic and in vivo growth was impaired
by Jagged2 silencing [57]. Overall these results suggest
that the activation of Notch signaling pathway, mediated
by the overexpression of Notch receptors or ligands,
may have a key role in promoting MM progression and
maintenance.
On the other side, Notch signaling in MM cells
can be also activated by Notch ligands expressed on
the surface membrane of surrounding BM cells (see
scheme in Figure 2). Xu et al. demonstrated that BMSCs
expressed DLL1 and were able to engage Notch2 in MM
cells. In turn, Notch2 activation caused the upregulation
of CYP1A1 (cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily
A, polypeptide 1), contributing to the development of
resistance to treatment with bortezomib [58]. Interestingly,
the combined treatment with a Notch-blocking agent and

bortezomib leads to an increase sensitivity to bortezomib
resulting in a significant improvement of the overall
survival in an in vivo model of MM [58].
A second and important outcome of Notch receptors
and ligands dysregulation in MM concerns the ability of
MM cells to shape the BM niche (see scheme in Figure 3).
Jagged2 increases the release of soluble factors including
interleukin 6 (IL6), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) from
BMSCs [41]. The released factors have a recognized
promoting activity for MM. Indeed, IL6 is the major
growth factor for MM cells [59], also involved in the
development of resistance to dexamethasone in vitro [60].
This is further confirmed by the evidence that Siltuximab,
an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, gives promising
results alone or in combination with dexamethasone in
a phase 2 clinical trial on patients with refractory MM
[61]. VEGF promotes MM cell growth [62] as well as
neo-angiogenesis [63], thereby directly and indirectly
promoting tumor burden and progression of MM [64].
IGF1 promotes survival in MM cell and development of
bortezomib resistance [65].
Notch signaling dysregulation in MM plays also
a role in MM-associated bone disease, contributing to
the unbalance between OCLs and OBLs in favor of the
first (see scheme in Figure 4). We recently dissected the
different effects due to Notch signaling dysregulation in
MM-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. In
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

particular we showed that: i) high Notch signaling in MM
cells stimulates the release of the major osteoclastogenic
soluble factor, RANKL; ii) MM cell-derived Notch
ligands (Jagged1 and 2) activate Notch signaling in
surrounding BMSCs, boosting the secretion of RANKL;
iii) RANKL engages RANK on OCL progenitors, thereby
activating the osteoclastogenic NF-kB pathway, which in
turn stimulates the osteoclastogenic Notch signaling by
promoting Notch2 expression; and iv) MM cell-derived
Jagged ligands further boost Notch signaling in OCL
progenitors by engaging Notch2. Notably, Jagged1/2
silencing is able to revert these effects [66].
Notch hyperactivity in MM may also affect OBL
development. Zanotti and co-workers demonstrated in
transgenic mice that the selective Notch activation in
OBL progenitors inhibits their differentiation [67]. This
suggests that MM cell-derived Notch ligands can also be
responsible for the decrease of OBLs by stimulating Notch
activity that hampers OBL progenitors differentiation.
These results, confirmed in vivo by the experiments
of Schwarzer and colleagues [68] with γ-secretase
inhibitors (GSIs), suggest that the Notch pathway
may represent a suitable target for the treatment of
MM-associated bone disease. Moreover, the tight
cooperation of Notch and NF-kB pathways (mediated by
RANKL) in MM-induced osteoclastogenesis suggests
that a combination treatment of Notch and proteasome
inhibitors could be even more effective. Interestingly, this

effectors involved. See text for details.

combined approach could not only affect osteolysis, but
also overcome MM-associated drug resistance. Indeed, as
reported by Xu and coworkers, GSI-mediated inhibition of
Notch2 in MM cell increases the sensitivity to bortezomib
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[58]. These findings provide a rationale for a combined
treatment with Notch and proteasome inhibitors that could
synergistically prevent bone disease and drug resistance.
Taken together the data reported above suggest that the

chemotherapics.

withdrawal in primary cells, we can speculate that a
suitable subgroup could be MM patients with MAF
translocations and consequent high Notch2 levels [40].
A complete gene expression analysis of Notch pathway
members could help in evaluating if other patients
subgroups (i.e. LB and HY; ref. 44) could be possible
candidates for a Notch tailored therapy.
Another aspect that should be considered is
the possible resistance of MM cells to anti-Notch
treatment. GSI-resistance, caused by mutations occurring
in downstream Notch mediators or by epigenetic
mechanisms, is well described in T-ALL [74, 75, 76],
nonetheless up to now it has not been reported in
MM cells.
A Notch-directed therapy in MM can get advantage
by the recent development of several compounds targeting
the different components of the Notch pathway (Table 2).
The most widely used drugs inducing Notch withdrawal
are the GSIs. The γ-secretase complex is responsible
for the proteolytic cleavage that allows the intracellular
portion of the Notch receptor to translocate to the nucleus
and activate the transcription by the CSL (CBF1/RBP-J,
Su(H), Lag1) nuclear factor [77]. We report the outcome
of different GSIs in clinical trials for cancer therapy.
MK0752 (Merck Chemicals Ltd) is a powerful noncompetitive oral GSI and represents the clinical analogues
of the compound MRK003. MRK003 has cytotoxic and
pro-apoptotic effects on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and
MM cells in vitro and ex vivo and is able to overcome the
protective effects of BMSCs [78]; it gave also promising
results on in vivo xenograft models of uterine serous
carcinoma and breast cancer [79, 80]. In the last years,
MK0752 has been clinically tested for T-ALL treatment
with poor results [81], while a trial on patients with
metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer or advanced
solid tumors, using intermittent MK0752 dosage, resulted
in Notch pathway inhibition associated to good tolerability
and clinical benefits (ref. 82; Trial ID NCT00106145).
Recently, MK0752 has been studied in combination
with other chemotherapics. A combination with tamoxifen
or letrozole gave promising results in the treatment of
early stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (ref.
83; Trial ID NCT00756717), while a combination with
docetaxel has been used for the treatment of patients
with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and
resulted effective in the depletion of the cancer stem cell
population (ref. 84; Trial ID NCT00645333).
PF-03084014 (Pfizer Oncology) is a small noncompetitive and reversible GSI. This compound has
shown a significant antitumor activity in several T-ALL
cell lines [85] and in breast cancer xenograft mice [86].
Moreover, PF-03084014 in combination with fludarabine
displayed a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and
chemotactic response of primary chronic lymphocytic
leukemia cells   [87]. PF-03084014 is currently tested
in phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors
(ref. 88; Trial ID NCT01286467).

NOTCH TARGETED THERAPIES:
STATE OF THE ART AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
As reported, Notch signaling alterations described in
MM result in an increased expression of Notch pathway
members including receptors and ligands [42]. These
alterations cause a moderate increase of Notch signaling in
comparison to Notch pathway hyperactivation occurring
in other types of cancer characterized by gain-of-function
Notch mutations, i.e. T-ALL [36], other lymphoid
malignancies [34] and solid tumors, including breast
cancer [69], ovarian cancer [70] and esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma [71]. It must also be noted that if a moderate
activation of Notch has a pro-tumor effect in MM cells, a
stronger activation due to a mutated constitutively active
Notch results in MM cell growth inhibition and apoptosis
[72]. Recently, Kannan and colleagues [73] provided
a possible explanation for this behavior, revealing that
the transcription of the Notch target Hairy/Enhancer of
Split1 (HES1), occurring upon Notch activation, may
have a different outcome depending on the relative levels
of HES1 and Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase1 (PARP1).
Indeed, the interaction between HES1 and PARP1 inhibits
HES1 growth promoting function and induces PARP1
activation resulting in consequent apoptosis. Consistently,
T-ALL cells that carry mutated hyperactive Notch1
and low levels of PARP1 display high levels of cell
proliferation and do not undergo apoptosis. Concerning
MM cells, we can speculate that, similarly to B-ALL cells,
they cannot bear high Notch signaling activation due to the
relatively high expression of PARP1 [73].
Although MM cell growth is affected not only
by Notch withdrawal but also by its hyperactivation, a
therapeutic approach based on Notch inhibition appears to
be safer in consideration of the oncogenic activity of Notch
in several cell types. A therapeutic approach directed
to inhibit Notch signaling in MM relies on previously
detailed in vitro and in vivo evidences of the outcomes of
Notch signaling inhibition, including decreased MM cell
proliferation [46, 47], stemness [56, 57], migration and
BM infiltration [46], MM-associated bone disease [66–68]
and an increased sensibility to pharmacological treatments
[47, 48, 58].
On the other side, despite the critical role of Notch
signaling in MM, the wide genetic heterogeneity might
give origin to molecular MM subtypes with different
sensibilities to an anti-Notch treatment.
Although a more comprehensive analysis should be
addressed to define the putative MM patients who could
benefit from a Notch-targeted approach by correlating
the molecular characterization and the outcome of Notch

Trial ID (Refs.)

RO4929097 (Roche) was tested in phase I study with
positive results in single cases of metastatic melanoma,
colorectal adenocarcinoma, epithelioid sarcoma out of
92 patients with advanced solid tumors [89]. In phase II
clinical trial involving patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer, RO4929097 did not change radiographic response
and time to progression at the used dose and schedule
(ref. 90; Trial ID NCT01116687).
RO4929097 was also tested in combination with
different chemotherapics or targeting agents like cediranib
(VEGF inhibitor; ref. 91; Trial ID NCT01131234),
temsirolimus (a mTOR inhibitor; ref. 92; Trial ID
NCT01198184) and gemcitabine (ref. 93; Trial ID
NCT01145456). These combination studies, despite the
presence of a high percentage (~50–70%) of patients with
stable disease, resulted in the reciprocal interference of the
used drugs causing the interruption of trials [94].
Independently from their efficacy, the most relevant
objection for the use of GSIs is that these drugs do
not exclusively target the Notch pathway. Indeed, the
GSIs affect γ-secretase which regulates the functions of
several substrates such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin [95]
and syndecan-3, ErbB4 and CD44 [96]. Moreover, GSIs
inhibit the activation of all the four Notch isoforms,
thereby affecting all the physiologic functions mediated
by the Notch pathway. This may explain the presence of
relevant adverse events as fatigue, skin disorders, headache,
hypophosphatemia and severe gastrointestinal toxicity [89].
Gut toxicity is the most serious GSI-associated side effect,
due to goblet cell metaplasia in the intestinal crypts [97].
Attempts to decrease GSIs toxicity without
affecting their efficacy had some successful results using
an intermitting dosage schedule in combination with
corticosteroids [94]. Additionally, in the last years, new
generation drugs were developed for a more specific
Notch directed therapy with the purpose of overcoming
GSI toxicity. Indeed, recent findings encourage the use of
approaches directed to selectively inhibit Notch receptors
or ligands. As a matter of fact, whereas it is recognized
that the inhibition of both Notch1 and Notch2 induces
intestinal goblet cell metaplasia [98] resulting in a major
gastrointestinal toxicity, a recent report indicates that this
side effect can be avoided through the selective inhibition
of Notch signaling activation mediated only by one Notch
receptor or one family of Notch ligands (Jagged or DLL).
Indeed, antibodies against Notch1 or Notch2 [99], or Notch
decoy molecules that selectively disrupt Notch/Jagged
or Notch/DLL interaction [100], did not or mildly affect
intestine differentiation.
In general, compounds for Notch directed-therapy
may be divided into two classes: monoclonal antibodies
and molecular drugs.

mAbs are specific for single members of the Notch family;
nonetheless their delivery in solid tumors can be highly
problematic, due to their high molecular weight. Thus,
anti-Notch antibodies are more frequently used in studies
on hematopoietic malignancies [101]. Notch targeting
mAbs have entered into early phase clinical development
as reported below.
OMP-59R5
(Tarextumab,
OncoMed
Pharmaceuticals-GlaxoSmithKline) is a fully humanized
antibody that targets Notch-2 and 3 receptors [102]. It was
tested in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
in a still ongoing trial on patients with untreated metastatic
pancreatic cancer and other epithelial tumors giving
preliminary promising results (Trial ID NCT01647828).
Phase I clinical studies are also conducted on advanced
solid tumors (Trial ID NCT01277146) and untreated
extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ref.103; Trial ID
NCT01859741).
OMP-52M51
(Anti-Notch1,
OncoMed
Pharmaceuticals-GlaxoSmithKline) is a novel antibody
specific for Notch-1 that blocks the activation of this
receptor by binding its negative regulatory region. It
was shown to improve the survival of T-ALL xenograft
mice [104] and it is currently under study in two Phase
I clinical trials in advanced lymphoid malignancies
(NCT01703572) and in solid cancers (NCT01778439).
OMP-52M51 and OMP-59R5 have not been tested yet
for MM treatment, although they promise to be effective
on patients characterized by high levels of Notch1 and
Notch2 expression.
OMP-21M18
(Demcizumab,
OncoMed
Pharmaceuticals), REGN421/SAR153192 (Enoticumab,
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) are humanized antibodybased drugs against the Notch ligand DLL4, which is
key in vessels formation [105]. These novel drugs have
been developed and successfully tested to contrast tumorassociated angiogenesis giving promising results in
phase I clinical trials on advanced solid tumors, causing
a reduction in tumor size with a general good tolerability
(ref. 106, Trial ID NCT00744562; ref. 107, Trial
ID NCT00871559).
The evidence that angiogenesis is increased in
the BM of MM patients in correlation with MM cell
infiltration, growth and survival [64], provides the rational
for a DLL4-based anti-angiogenic therapy in this tumor;
nonetheless it must be noted that trials with bevacizumab
in MM [108] gave limited results and do not encourage an
anti-angiogenic approach in MM.
Recent data in the literature highlight the possibility
of affecting other biological features including drug
resistance and bone disease by targeting Notch ligands
in MM. Several evidences justify a therapeutic approach
directed to Notch ligands. Indeed, BMSC-derived DLL1
promotes MM cells growth and resistance to bortezomib
[56, 58], Jagged2 overexpression in MM may induce
the expression of proliferative and survival factors such
as IL6, VEGF and IGF1 [41]; and MM-derived Jagged1

Monoclonal antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were recently
developed against both Notch receptors and ligands.

In comparison to antibody-based drugs, molecular
drugs are more easily deliverable. SAHM1 is a stapled
peptide derived from Mastermind-like (MAML) protein,
able to block the canonical Notch signaling and has a
therapeutic potential in hematopoietic tumors, indeed it is
able to induce apoptosis in MM and T-ALL cells [46, 110].
Recently, Kangsamaksin et al. developed new
decoy peptides based on Notch1 EGF-like repeats fused
to human IgGγ heavy chain (Fc). These decoys may
selectively inhibit DLL4 or Jagged1 without affecting the
signal mediated by other ligands. The authors showed their
efficacy against melanoma, breast, lung and pancreatic
cancer both in vitro and in vivo, including a significantly
reduced renal, gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity,
compared to GSI treatment [100].

CONCLUSIONS
Current studies on Notch pathway in MM indicate
that the dysregulated Notch receptors and ligands increase
the activation of Notch signaling in MM cells promoting
their progression and the ability to shape a supportive
surrounding microenvironment. The contribution of
aberrantly activated Notch signaling in drug resistance and
development of MM associated bone disease provides a
strong rational for a therapeutic approach in MM directed
to control Notch activity in both malignant plasma cells
and the surrounding BM stroma. In our opinion, among
all the Notch-targeted therapeutic approaches available
or in development, those specifically directed to Jagged1
and 2 promise to be effective and prevent the side effects
associated to GSIs.
