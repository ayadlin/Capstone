Abstract
Patients relapsing with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) face a dismal outcome. The aim of this
study was to identify new markers of drug resistance and clinical response in T-ALL. We measured gene
expression and drug sensitivity in 15 pediatric T-ALL cell lines to ﬁnd signatures predictive of resistance to 10
agents used in therapy. These were used to generate a model for outcome prediction in patient cohorts using
microarray data from diagnosis specimens. In three independent T-ALL cohorts, the 10-drug model was able to
accurately identify patient outcome, indicating that the in vitro–derived drug–gene proﬁles were clinically
relevant. Importantly, predictions of outcome within each cohort were linked to distinct drugs, suggesting that
different mechanisms contribute to relapse. Sulﬁte oxidase (SUOX) expression and the drug-transporter ABCC1
(MRP1) were linked to thiopurine sensitivity, suggesting novel pathways for targeting resistance. This study
advances our understanding of drug resistance in T-ALL and provides new markers for patient stratiﬁcation. The
results suggest potential beneﬁt from the earlier use of 6-mercaptopurine in T-ALL therapy or the development of
adjuvants that may sensitize blasts to this drug. The methodology developed in this study could be applied to
other cancers to achieve patient stratiﬁcation at the time of diagnosis. Cancer Res; 73(9); 2749–59. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Improved survival for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients is one of the success stories of cancer
research. From an essentially fatal disease 50 years ago, the
empirical development of complex multiagent chemotherapy
has resulted in the achievement of overall 5-year survival rates
of 90% (1, 2). However, lower 5-year survival rates are seen
in infants (<1 year of age, 53%) and those with T-lineage ALL
(T-ALL, 81%). For the signiﬁcant number of patients that
experience relapse, survival rates are dramatically reduced
and worsen with each subsequent disease recurrence (3). This
adverse trend is even more pronounced in T-ALL and those
with known clinical risk factors (3). To further improve outcomes, many researchers have attempted to develop models
that can be used to predict clinical outcome based on geneexpression patterns present in patients' leukemia cells at the
time of diagnosis (4–12). Comparison of these proﬁles with

those observed at relapse has yielded important clues to the
differences that emerge following therapy failure (13–15).
An alternative but related approach has been to compare
diagnostic gene-expression proﬁles between patients with
demonstrated differences in clinical response to remission
induction therapy or in their sensitivity to these agents as
measured ex vivo (16–19). However, the inﬂuence of other
agents, such as those used in consolidation and maintenance
therapy have not been studied in this way.
To address this we have interrogated an in-house dataset of
in vitro–derived resistance and gene expression proﬁles to
generate a model that can predict drug sensitivity and therefore outcome, incorporating data from all 10 chemotherapy
agents commonly used in T-ALL therapy. In addition to
revealing insights into the pathways associated with drug
resistance to each of the 10 different drugs, we have been able
to use this drug–gene model to accurately predict outcome in 3
independent cohorts of T-ALL patients. This novel approach
revealed that relapse in individual patients is linked to distinct
drugs, and highlights a particular importance for 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) in determining outcome in T-ALL. Based on
these ﬁndings, we suggest that there may be a role for the use of
6MP in earlier phases of T-ALL therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and drug-sensitivity proﬁling

described and comprises 9 T-ALL lines derived in our own
laboratory from pediatric ALL bone marrow specimens (PER
cell lines), plus 6 additional T-ALL cell lines obtained from

external sources (20, 21). Cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10 nmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% to 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.
The media for PER-cell lines contained additional nonessential
amino acids and pyruvate, whereas 300 units/mL interleukin-2
is required for growth of PER-427 and PER-487. The sensitivity
of the T-ALL cell lines to methylprednisolone (MPRED), dexamethasone (DEX), cytosine arabinoside (ARAC), 6-thioguanine
(6TG), 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), daunorubicin (DNR), doxorubicin (DOX), L-asparaginase (ASP), vincristine (VCR), and
methotrexate (MTX) has been previously published (20) and
was measured using the MTT assay with drugs incubated for 4
days. The IC50 (drug concentration that inhibits cell growth by
50%) was used as the measure of drug response, with the IC50
being recorded as double the highest concentration tested
in cases where 50% cytotoxicity could not be achieved (20).
DNA ﬁngerprinting conﬁrmed the identity of each of the
cell lines (20).
Patient cohorts
Gene expression proﬁling of the primary patient cohort
analyzed in this study has been previously described (7) and
comprised 50 T-ALL patients treated on Children's Oncology
Group (CCG/COG) protocol 1961 for high-risk ALL (22). Bone
marrow specimens were obtained at diagnosis from patients at
either the Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Australia or
provided by COG. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Institutional Review Board, and informed consent for the use of
tissues was obtained for all individuals. All patients achieved
remission following induction therapy; those patients achieving complete continuous remission (CCR) had median followup times of 7.3 years, whereas 44% of the patients subsequently
relapsed (R). Expression data from the 2 Winter and colleagues
cohorts (microarray CEL ﬁles and patient details) were
obtained from the authors (23) and normalized by robust
multiarray analysis (RMA) as previously described (7). Induction failure cases were removed from these cohorts before
analysis, resulting in cohort sizes of 44 patients for Pediatric
Oncology Group (POG/COG) Protocol 9404 (30 CCR, 14R,
measured on HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays) and 41 patients for
POG-8704 (24 CCR, 17R, measured on HG-U133A arrays).
Gene expression proﬁling
Brieﬂy, RNA was extracted from cell lines in exponential
growth phase and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays (ArrayExpress Accession E-MTAB-1208; refs. 11 and 13).
RNA from the CCG-1961 T-ALL cohort (n ¼ 50) was extracted
from bone marrow specimens and hybridized to HG-U133Plus
2.0 GeneChips (ArrayExpress Accession E-MTAB-1205; ref. 7).
Microarray data were normalized using RMA as previously
described (5, 13). Gene expression values across the T-ALL cell
line panel (n ¼ 15 cell lines) were log2 transformed and
correlated against log2 IC50 scores from the same panel using
Pearson's correlation as described (11) to generate individual
lists of genes correlating with the sensitivity proﬁle for each
drug (n ¼ 10 drugs). Drug pairs belonging to the same drug
class, namely MPRED and DEX (glucocorticoids), DOX and
DNR (anthracyclines), and 6MP and 6TG (thiopurines), were

cross-referenced to identify genes most signiﬁcantly correlated
against both agents in each class. Genes with signiﬁcant
correlation scores against these 3 drug pairs and the 4 additional single agents were interrogated for biological relevance
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems Inc.) to
identify pathways associated with resistance. To generate a
global gene expression–phenotype proﬁle for all drugs, the top
50 correlating probe sets for each individual drug were combined (resulting in 380 nonredundant probe sets) and similarly
analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
Ten drug modeling for prediction of clinical outcome
Modeling of in vitro–derived drug–gene data was done in 2
stages to derive testable predictions of prognosis in patient
cohorts. First, for individual drugs, we conducted principal
component analysis (PCA) using log2 gene expression values
from the top 50 probe sets correlating with drug IC50 within the
T-ALL cell line panel. The top 10 principal components from
each PCA were then used as covariates in linear regression
analysis to generate models for the prediction of IC50 values
(resistance scores) in the cell line data for each drug. The
use of PCA and linear regression of the obtained components
was designed to collapse the larger number of variables
(50 probe sets/drug) for modeling within the smaller number
of cell lines (n ¼ 15). Second, these in vitro–derived models of
drug resistance were applied to gene-expression datasets
from 3 different T-ALL patient cohorts (see Materials and
Methods) to predict in vivo correlates of resistance that could
be used to stratify patients into those with a low or high
probability of relapse. To do this, the PCA rotation matrix for
each of the 10 drugs developed using the cell line data was
directly applied to the expression data from each patient
cohort, and the resulting principal component scores were
used in the linear regression models previously developed for
each drug to predict "resistance scores" in individual patients.
We then used these "resistance scores" in logistic regression to
model the probability of relapse for each patient. This probability was converted into a prediction of CCR/relapse labels
using a probability cut-off point of 50%, generating model
accuracies, sensitivity (the percentage of correctly predicted
relapse patients), speciﬁcity (the percentage of correctly predicted nonrelapse patients), positive predictive values (the
proportion of patients among those predicted to relapse that
actually relapsed), and negative predictive values (the proportion of patients among those predicted as nonrelapse that
actually achieved CCR). This stratiﬁcation was also used for
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, with signiﬁcance determined
by log-rank test. The logistic regression models used to predict
outcome in each patient cohort based on the calculated
multiple-drug resistance scores are provided in Supplementary
Table S5.
Drug contribution analysis
To assess whether, for any given patient, a prediction of
relapse within our model might be driven by the inﬂuence of
one or several drugs in particular, we ﬁrst scored the positive or
negative inﬂuence of each drug within the model (predicted
resistance score  equation coefﬁcient), and summed the total

In Vitro Drug–Gene Modeling for T-ALL Outcome

positive and negative scores for all drugs for each patient. The
balance of these scores (plus equation constant) determines
the prediction of outcome, with positive sums being associated
with relapse, and negative values associated with nonrelapse.
In real-world terms this represents the balance of resistances
(positive effects) and sensitivities (negative effects) to the
multiple drugs used to treat patients, the outcome of which
contributes to a patient's prognosis. For each patient for whom
we were able to correctly predict outcome (relapse/nonrelapse), the contribution of each drug was therefore calculated
as a percentage of the averaged total score within the cohort
required to be reached to deﬁnitively generate that prediction.
This generates an estimate of the relative contribution for each
drug toward the correct prediction of outcome for each patient
in that particular cohort.
To assess whether there might be groups of patients
sharing similar drug contribution proﬁles, we conducted
unsupervised hierarchical clustering using these calculated
drug contribution scores and a correlative distance metric
(1  r). This identiﬁed subpopulations of patients for whom
the pattern of drug inﬂuence on outcome was similar.
Finally, we calculated the frequency with which particular
drugs were found to be the strongest drivers for the accurate
prediction of outcome in each cohort by counting all occurrences where a drug had either the highest contribution
score for a particular patient, or a contribution score greater
than 50% of the score for most prominent drug for that
patient. This was done separately for positive and negative
scoring drugs to ﬁnd those that were the most prominent
drivers of relapse and nonrelapse prediction in each individual. This process was repeated for all 3 T-ALL cohorts,
and the total number of instances for each drug (or drugclass) were summed to calculate the overall proportion of

patients for whom that drug (or drug-class) was a major
determinant for the accurate prediction of outcome.

Results
Genes and pathways associated with drug resistance in
T-ALL cell lines
Our laboratory has developed an authenticated panel of
pediatric T-ALL cell lines that have been grown in the absence
of drug selection. These cultures retain critical features of the
primary disease and their drug-resistance proﬁles parallel the
spectrum of resistance that has been observed in primary
patient specimens (20). We have previously examined the
baseline resistance of these 15 T-ALL cell lines to the glucocorticoids DEX and MPRED (20) and correlated the data with
gene expression proﬁles as determined by HG-U133A microarray (11). Here we have extended this study to examine the
drug-resistance proﬁles of 8 additional drugs used for pediatric
ALL. To reduce noise and increase the power of the analysis,
data from drugs belonging to the same drug class (i.e., anthracyclines, glucocorticoids, and thiopurines) were cross-referenced to produce gene correlates for the drug class rather than
the individual agents.
The top correlating genes for each of the drug pairs and the 4
additional individual drugs are shown in Tables 1 to 4, whereas
the biological processes associated with these gene sets (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) are shown in Fig. 1A (further details
provided in Supplementary Table S3). Pathways involved in
cancer signaling, cell death, growth and proliferation, and
metabolism were strongly associated with most drug classes
(Fig. 1A). The biological features revealing the most signiﬁcant
associations in this analysis were for thiopurines (gene
expression, differentiation/development, cell growth and proliferation, and cell death), anthracyclines (cancer signaling

became apparent that there was a strong reciprocity in the
relationship between glucocorticoids and MTX. This is showed
in Fig. 1B, which shows that the most signiﬁcantly correlated

In Vitro Drug–Gene Modeling for T-ALL Outcome

HIF-signaling, ER-signaling, and posttranslational modiﬁcation). This reciprocity is an unexpected relationship that we
have reported previously (11, 20) and although the mechanism
is not clear, the relevance for the clinic is that cross-resistance,
which is often observed between drugs in ALL, is not expected
to develop between glucocorticoids and MTX. This lack of
cross-resistance is supported by the ﬁndings of a small drugsensitivity study in primary ALL specimens published more
than a decade ago (24). Moreover, our data indicate that the
transcriptional networks that underpin a resistant phenotype
for one drug class may actually sensitize cells to the other, that
is, in patients with demonstrated resistance to glucocorticoids
for example, MTX should not only continue to be effective but
its efﬁcacy may in fact be increased. A more detailed breakdown of the gene networks uniquely represented or enhanced
within the GC.MTX signature (Supplementary Table S3), shows
that protein synthesis, particularly eukaryotic initiation factor
2 (eIF2) signaling, is the most prominent feature emerging from
this gene set (P ¼ 2.17  107), suggesting that control of
translation is one of the critical pathways determining the
relative balance of glucocorticoid and MTX sensitivity within
the cell. The emergence of estrogen-receptor signaling within
the GC.MTX signature (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S3),
which is clearly highly relevant for glucocorticoid resistance,
may be explained by such changes to translational control.
Finally, it has been reported that the activity of ABCG2, one of
the major drug transporters for MTX, is inhibited by DEX and
MPRED (25), and although there was no signiﬁcant correlation
of ABCG2 expression with resistance to these drugs in this
study, it remains possible that posttranscriptional effects on
ABCG2 or other drug transporters also contribute to the
observed GC.MTX reciprocity.
Among the top-ranked genes correlating with resistance to
the agents in Fig. 1, there were several of particular biological
interest. Highly negatively correlated with glucocorticoids was
the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene (Table 1), the expression of which we have previously showed to be associated with

this drug-class in T-ALL (10, 11). RNAi knockdown of MLL
expression in T-ALL cell lines signiﬁcantly increased resistance
to DEX and g irradiation indicating an important role for wildtype MLL in the control of cellular apoptosis (10). The top gene
correlated with ASP resistance (Table 1) was Nitrogen Permease Regulator-Like 3 (NPRL3), thought to be part of a complex
that mediates autophagy (26) and amino acid starvation
signals to TORC1, the mTOR complex responsible for monitoring cellular nutrient status (27). This is highly relevant given
the action of ASP in depleting asparagine levels. Asparagine
synthetase (ASNS), the upregulation of which is a known
mechanism of ASP resistance, was also signiﬁcantly correlated
with ASP resistance in T-ALL cell lines (Supplementary Table
S2).
Genes known to alter the cellular sensitivity to thiopurines
include the phase II enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase
(TPMT) and the cellular oxidoreductase xanthine oxidase (28,
29). No correlation between the expression of these genes and
thiopurine IC50 was observed in this study, but the top gene
associated with thiopurine resistance (Table 2) was sulﬁte
oxidase (SUOX), a mitochondrial enzyme that belongs to the
same family of molybdenum oxotransferases that includes
xanthine oxidase (30). An association between SUOX and
thiopurine sensitivity has not been described in the literature
previously, but because the enzymatic activities of SUOX and
xanthine oxidase rely on molybdenum metabolites from a
common biosynthetic pathway (30), it is possible that altered
SUOX expression may indirectly inﬂuence the activity of xanthine oxidase and the rate of thiopurine detoxiﬁcation via
modulation of molybdenum metabolite levels. Also highly
relevant for resistance mechanisms to this class of drug
was the positive correlation of ABCC1 or MRP1 (multidrug
resistance protein 1) with thiopurines (Table 2). MRP1 is a
ubiquitously expressed efﬂux pump known to transport the
products of phase II enzyme xenobiotic detoxiﬁcation (31).
Because the important thiopurine-converting gene TPMT
codes for a phase II detoxiﬁcation enzyme, this suggests a

The other known drug transporter found to be signiﬁcantly
associated with resistance in this study was MFSD10 (major
facilitator superfamily domain member 10, or TETRAN), which

was signiﬁcantly correlated to ARAC IC50 (Table 3). The activity
of this transporter has previously been linked to the development of resistance to nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory agents
(32), but to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst reported association
of the gene with resistance to ARAC. The correlation

coefﬁcients of other genes known to be involved in canonical
pathways of drug resistance, multidrug resistance, detoxiﬁcation, and/or metabolism are given in Supplementary Table S2.
Of particular note are genes signiﬁcantly correlated with
multiple drugs and/or drug classes such as: DGUOK (deoxyguanosine kinase, involved in the phosphorylation of purine
deoxyribonucleosides) signiﬁcantly correlated with resistance
to glucocorticoids, ASP, anthracyclines, and VCR; GLUD1/2
(glutamate dehydrogenase, an important enzyme for glutamate metabolism and therefore cancer cell growth) associated
with glucocorticoids and anthracyclines; and various genes
involved with TNF signaling, such as TRAF3 (TNF receptorassociated factor 3), signiﬁcantly correlated with glucocorticoids, ASP, anthracyclines, ARAC, and VCR resistance
(Supplementary Table S2). The cytochrome P450 enzyme
CYP3A43 was signiﬁcantly negatively regulated with resistance
to both thiopurines and ASP (Supplementary Table S2), suggesting a previously undescribed role for this enzyme in the
cellular detoxiﬁcation of these agents.
Prognostic relevance of drug–gene proﬁles
To assess whether the T-ALL drug–gene correlates we had
observed in vitro were relevant for mechanisms of resistance in
primary cells, we developed a statistical model to describe the
IC50 proﬁles of our panel of cell lines using gene expression
data, and incorporating the information from all 10 drugs (see
Materials and Methods). We then applied this model to
microarray data from the CCG-1961 T-ALL cohort (22) that
we have previously published (7), to generate "resistance
scores" for each drug and each patient specimen (n ¼ 50).
These in turn were used to model the probability of relapse for
each patient. Importantly, this approach was able to identify
patients with a signiﬁcantly poorer outcome (Fig. 2A), indicating that the gene expression proﬁles correlated with in vitro
drug resistance were also correlated to clinical outcome in
patients. In contrast, the clinical features of age, white blood
cell count, and gender have no signiﬁcant univariate association with outcome in this relatively small cohort (7). To
validate this ﬁnding, we applied the same model to 2 further
T-ALL patient cohorts (33, 34), making use of array data
previously published (23). Once again, the model was able to
predict patients with signiﬁcantly poorer outcome in both
cohorts (Fig. 2B and C). The prediction accuracies for the 10drug model across each of the cohorts are provided in Supplementary Table S4 and the logistic regression equations used
in each case are in Supplementary Table S5.
Drug-contribution modeling
To assess whether, for any given patient, a prediction of
relapse within our 10-drug model might be driven by particular
drugs, we evaluated the relative contribution of each drug
within the model toward the ﬁnal designation of outcome. In
the CCG-1961 T-ALL cohort, this analysis clearly indicated that
the expression proﬁles associated with 2 drugs in particular,
6MP and MPRED, were key factors in driving the correct
prediction of relapse or nonrelapse (Fig. 3A). Further analysis
indicated that patients within this cohort that went on to
relapse were associated at the time of diagnosis with higher

resistance scores for 6MP and lower resistance scores for
MPRED (Fig. 3B). We have previously reported that glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL is associated with a proliferative
metabolism (11), in contrast to many other chemotherapeutic
drugs, which act more efﬁciently in rapidly dividing cells.
Under this hypothesis, increased glucocorticoid sensitivity
would therefore be consistent with slower growth (11), and
this in turn would be associated with an increased resistance to
other chemotherapeutic agents including 6MP, which may on
balance contribute to poorer clinical outcome.
To assess whether subgroups of patients existed within this
cohort for whom the correct prediction of relapse might be
driven by different patterns of drug effects within the model, we
conducted hierarchical clustering based on these drug-contribution proﬁles. This clearly identiﬁed 2 patient subgroups,
which behaved distinctly (Fig. 3C). When the contribution
scores for these subgroups were plotted separately it became

apparent that although relapse predictions in one group were
driven by expression proﬁles associated with 6MP resistance,
the other group was most strongly inﬂuenced by proﬁles
associated with MTX resistance (Fig. 3D). This indicates that
2 different drug–response proﬁles might underpin poor clinical
outcome within this cohort.
To validate this approach we repeated the entire drugcontribution analysis using array data (23) from the independent POG-8704 (33) and POG-9404 (34) T-ALL cohorts. Interestingly, the correct prediction of relapse in each of these
cohorts was inﬂuenced by distinct patterns of drug contribu-

tion. In POG-8704, subgroups were associated with ARAC,
6MP, and DNR-resistance signatures, whereas in POG-9404
ARAC and MTX proﬁles were the main contributors to relapse
prediction (Fig. 3E–G, and Supplementary Fig. S1). Notably,
POG-9404 was the only cohort for which 6MP gene expression
correlates made no substantial contribution to outcome prediction (Fig. 3G), yet was the only study of the 3 in which 6MP
was used through all phases of therapy including induction
(34), suggesting that augmented use of this agent for all
patients may have effectively removed the prognostic inﬂuence
of this drug within the model.

In Vitro Drug–Gene Modeling for T-ALL Outcome

To summarize the pattern of drug inﬂuence observed across
all 3 cohorts, we calculated the overall proportion of patients
for whom the correct prediction of outcome was strongly
inﬂuenced by each drug or drug class (Fig. 3H). These data
show that the expression signatures most useful for the correct
prediction of relapse across all 3 cohorts were linked to
resistance to the thiopurines (particularly 6MP). In contrast,
in vitro–derived expression correlates for VCR were generally
without prognostic inﬂuence in these patients (Fig. 3H).

Discussion
In this study we have showed that resistance proﬁles to
different drugs measured in T-ALL cell lines in vitro are
associated with distinct biological pathways and that these
pathways have direct clinical relevance for patient outcome.
The identiﬁcation of reliable prognostic factors has been more
difﬁcult for T-ALL than for B-lineage ALL (35) and improved
markers are needed for outcome prediction to improve T-ALL
patient-risk stratiﬁcation. This is exempliﬁed in the CCG-1961
cohort where we have previously showed age, white blood cell
count and gender to have no signiﬁcant univariate association
with outcome (7). Although the adequacy of cell lines to
accurately reﬂect in vivo disease continues to be a matter of
considerable debate (36), we have previously showed that our
panel shows critical features of the primary disease, particularly in relation to drug-sensitivity proﬁles and patterns of
growth (20, 37), and in the majority of cases unsupervised
clustering of microarray data accurately pairs cell lines with
the bone marrow specimens from which they were derived.
Critically, the model developed in this in vitro setting has been
validated using primary material from 3 independent T-ALL
patient cohorts, clearly showing the clinical relevance of these
drug–gene signatures.
This is not the ﬁrst time that in vitro gene-expression proﬁles
have been used to model drug-resistance and subsequent
patient outcome in cancer (38–42). In particular, Lee and
colleagues published a sophisticated algorithm to translate
drug activities in the NCI-60 cell line panel to predict drugsensitivity and clinical outcome in multiple cancer types (40).
However, many of these published models have focused on
individual agents and typically did not test the prognostic
power of their classiﬁers in multiple independent patient
cohorts. Recently 2 groups have generated large cancer cell
line drug-biomarker databases, combining genome-wide
sequencing approaches with high-throughput drug-library
screening (43, 44) but neither of these have yet been used to
generate predictive models of outcome in patient cohorts. The
strongest studies in this area in the ﬁeld of ALL, focused on ex
vivo drug-sensitivity measurements of diagnostic patient specimens (17, 18). Although these successfully generated geneexpression models that could be validated in independent
cohorts, they focused only on the 4 agents most commonly
used in remission induction therapy. This study extends these
ﬁndings by including interaction effects from the other drugs
routinely used in consolidation and maintenance therapy.
Our results have highlighted particular genes and pathways
associated with sensitivity or resistance to each of the 10 agents
tested. The cell lines tested have been grown in the absence of

www.aacrjournals.org

drug selection and their sensitivity proﬁle therefore reﬂects
naturally occurring diversity within the panel. As such, few of
the top-ranked genes represent canonical drug-resistance
markers, echoing the ﬁndings from Holleman and colleagues
(18), where 98% of the genes shown to be associated with
resistance in primary specimens were not previously linked to
classical resistance mechanisms. Instead, novel associations
were revealed from our data, including a link between MLL
expression and glucocorticoid resistance (10), and a potential
role for sulﬁte oxidase (SUOX) and the drug-transporter ABCC1
(MRP1) in mediating sensitivity to thiopurines, relationships
that we are currently exploring experimentally. It is clear
however, both from our ﬁndings and from numerous studies
in this area, that diverse pathway interactions are often associated with common resistance phenotypes. Finally, our ﬁndings have also highlighted an unexpected reciprocity between
MTX and glucocorticoid resistance, pointing to a convergence
of metabolic pathways for these agents and suggesting there
would be clinical beneﬁt from the use of MTX in situations
where glucocorticoid resistance is observed, for example ALL
patients at the time of relapse or those with poor early
responses to 7-day prednisone.
One of the most important indications from this study is that
6MP may play a particularly important role in determining
outcome in T-ALL. Mercaptopurine was one of the ﬁrst chemotherapy agents used to treat pediatric ALL (29) and is a
cornerstone of maintenance therapy along with another
important antimetabolite, MTX (45, 46). Other studies have
showed that thiopurines may be of particular beneﬁt in T-ALL
and called for more intensive use of this class of agent to treat
this patient group (46, 47). Our ﬁndings are consistent with this
commentary and would support consideration for the use of
6MP in earlier stages of T-ALL therapy, with carefully designed
clinical trials required to directly test this hypothesis. In Blineage ALL, the drugs given in the ﬁrst 4 weeks of therapy
(typically prednisolone, VCR, DNR, and ASP) seem to be critical
because the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the
end of induction is predictive of long-term outcome (48). In
contrast, MRD at a later time point (day 78) is more prognostic
in T-ALL (48), indicating that it is the response to the drugs
generally received in postinduction consolidation therapy
(which includes 6MP) that are most important for T-ALL (2).
Although ex vivo testing of diagnostic specimens has shown
T-ALL patients to be generally sensitive to 6MP (49), our data
predicts a certain level of resistance may exist in some patients
at the time of disease presentation. Because 6MP is myelosuppressive, it is often administered at the limits of tolerability
and increasing dose intensity to counter resistance may not
therefore be possible for many patients (2, 46). An alternative
approach may be to develop adjuvant therapies that sensitize
blasts to 6MP exposure. Examples of existing agents that are
known to augment cellular sensitivity to 6MP include allopurinol, which inhibits the 6MP detoxifying enzyme xanthine
oxidase (50), and MTX, which is well known to synergize with
6MP through a convergence of metabolic pathways (45). As a
result of this latter fact, 6MP and MTX are modulated in
parallel in most clinical trials, however a customized approach
based on patient genotype for the enzyme TPMT (a deﬁciency

of which dramatically increases the risk of mercaptopurineinduced toxicity) would better leverage the synergistic relationship of these 2 agents by retaining both at their limits of
tolerability (2). Alternative approaches to sensitize blasts to
6MP, and therefore further improve response to thiopurine
therapy, may be provided by targeting the genes and pathways
linked to 6MP sensitivity in this study.
