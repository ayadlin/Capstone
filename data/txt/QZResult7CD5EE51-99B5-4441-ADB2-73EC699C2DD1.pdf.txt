Abstract
Acquired platinum resistance is a serious problem in the
treatment of ovarian carcinomas. However, the mechanism of
the drug resistance has not been elucidated. Here, we show
functional significance of restoration of BRCA2 protein by
secondary BRCA2 mutations in acquired drug resistance of
BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinoma. Three ovarian cancer cell
lines (PEO1, PEO4, and PEO6) were derived from a BRCA2
mutation [5193C>G (Y1655X)] carrier with ovarian carcinoma
with acquired cisplatin resistance and a secondary BRCA2
mutation [5193C>T (Y1655Y)] that canceled the inherited
mutation. PEO1 was BRCA2 deficient and sensitive to cisplatin
and a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, AG14361,
whereas PEO4 was resistant. PEO4 and PEO6, derived from
ascites at the time of relapse with cisplatin resistance, had the
secondary mutation and were BRCA2 proficient. In vitro
cisplatin/AG14361 selection of PEO1 led to restoration of
BRCA2 due to another secondary BRCA2 mutation. BRCA2
depletion sensitized BRCA2-restored PEO1 clones and PEO4 to
cisplatin/AG14361. Thus, restoration of BRCA2 due to secondary BRCA2 mutation is involved in acquired drug
resistance of BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinoma. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Chemotherapy with platinum compounds, such as cisplatin and
carboplatin, is initially effective for most patients with ovarian
carcinomas. However, the majority eventually becomes refractory
to platinum treatment (1). BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor gene
responsible for familial breast/ovarian cancer. BRCA2 controls
homologous recombination by regulating RAD51 (2, 3). BRCA1and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2)–deficient cells are hypersensitive to
cisplatin and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors
(4–6). Tumors from heterozygous BRCA1/2 mutation carriers
usually show loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1/2 loci and are
presumed to be BRCA1/2 deficient (7–9). Consistently, women with

BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian carcinoma have a better prognosis than
those without BRCA1/2 mutation if they receive platinum-based
therapy (10), and PARP inhibitors are becoming a therapeutic
option in BRCA1/2-mutated cancers (6). However, even patients
with BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian carcinoma frequently experience
recurrence with platinum resistance.
Acquired resistance to cisplatin in vitro in a BRCA2-mutated
pancreatic cancer cell line, Capan-1, is mediated by secondary
mutations in BRCA2 that restore the wild-type BRCA2 reading
frame (11, 12). Three cases of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian
cancer with secondary BRCA2 mutation have been reported (11, 12),
suggesting involvement of secondary BRCA2 mutation in platinumresistance of ovarian cancer. However, because of lack of a human
BRCA2-deficient ovarian cancer cell line model, the functional
significance of secondary BRCA2 mutations in ovarian cancer has
not been shown. Here, we report the first human BRCA2-deficient
ovarian cancer cell line model and the functional significance of
secondary BRCA2 mutations in acquired drug resistance of ovarian
cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Ovarian cancer cell lines (PEO1, 2008, 2008+FANCF, C13*,
OAW42, TOV-21G, TOV-112D, OV-90, PA-1, ES-2, Caov-3, SK-OV-3, SW626,
NIH:OVCAR-3, DOV13, RMG-1, A2780, IGROV-1, OVCAR-5, OVCAR-8,
A1847, OAW28, COLO720E, 59M; ref. 13) and PEO6 (14) were described
previously. PEO1 and PEO4 (15) were gifts from Dr. S. Williams (Fox Chase
Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). Cell lines were grown in DMEM with 10%
FCS in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere at 37jC. g irradiation
was delivered using a JL Shepherd Mark I Cesium Irradiator (JL Shepherd &
Associates). PEO1 cells were selected in cisplatin (4 Amol/L; Sigma) or a
PARP inhibitor (AG14361 (4 Amol/L), a gift of Pfizer), containing medium
for 4 wk. Drug-resistant colonies were picked and expanded in normal
medium. Initially, 14 cisplatin-selected clones were picked, but three of
them (C4-3, C4-8, and C4-9) were omitted, because C4-8 and C4-9 did not
grow and C4-3 turned out to be a mixed population. Therefore, 11 cisplatinselected clones were analyzed. Initially, 12 AG14361-selected clones were
picked, but 9 of them were omitted, because they did not grow. Therefore,
three AG14361-selected clones were analyzed.
Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. BRCA2
Western blotting using anti-BRCA2 Ab-1 (OP95; EMD Biosciences) and Ab-2
(PC146; EMD Biosciences) and immunostaining for RAD51 were done as
described (11).
BRCA2 sequencing. Extraction of genomic DNA and RNA, reverse
transcription, PCR, and sequencing of BRCA2 were done as described (11).
All nucleotide numbers refer to the cDNA human sequence of BRCA2
(accession no. U43746; version U43746.1 GI: 1161383; Genbank).
Drug sensitivity assays. Cisplatin/AG14361 sensitivity of cells was
determined by crystal violet assay as described (11).

tagged BRCA2-pcDNA3.1 constructs. After 72 h, cells were harvested and
the number of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–expressing cells was
assessed by flow cytometry. In parallel, we determined transfection/
expression efficiency for BRCA2 by fluorescently labeling cells from these
transfection experiments with an anti-FLAG antibody and counting the
number of FLAG-BRCA2–expressing cells per 1,000 cells using a
fluorescence microscope. The ratio of GFP-expressing cells induced by
wild-type or mutant BRCA2 compared with vector control in the
homologous recombination assay was then plotted after adjustment for
transfection efficiency (11).
Clinical specimens. Tissue samples from the BRCA2-mutated ovarian
cancer patient from whom the ovarian cancer cell lines, PEO1, PEO4, and
PEO6, were derived were obtained from the University of Edinburgh. The

study was approved by Institutional Review Boards of Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center.

Results and Discussion
We tested 25 ovarian cancer cell lines for expression of BRCA2
protein and found that BRCA2 protein was undetectable in PEO1
(Fig. 1A). PEO1 was derived from the ascites of a patient with
poorly differentiated ovarian serous adenocarcinoma that was still
clinically responsive to cisplatin at the first relapse (14, 15). The
clinical course of this patient is summarized in Fig. 1B. Remarkably,
in two ovarian cancer cell lines (PEO4 and PEO6) derived from the

same patient obtained when her carcinoma had acquired clinical
cisplatin resistance, BRCA2 protein was detectable (Fig. 1A). PEO1
was sensitive to cisplatin and a PARP inhibitor (AG14361), whereas
PEO4 was resistant (Figs. 1C and 2D), consistent with the BRCA2
protein expression status.
The patient turned out to be a heterozygous carrier of
BRCA2.5193C>G (Y1655X) nonsense mutation (Fig. 1D). Consistently, PEO1 had the hemizygous nonsense mutation (5193C>G).
PEO1 is the first and only human BRCA2-deficient ovarian cancer
cell line described, to the best of our knowledge.
Interestingly, PEO4 and PEO6 had a silent mutation (5193C>T,
Y1655Y) instead (Fig. 1D). In neoplastic cells in the ascites
from which PEO4 and PEO6 were derived, at the relapse with
clinical cisplatin resistance, 5193C>T was also detected. Thus,
the secondary mutation (5193C>T) that canceled the inherited
nonsense mutation (5193C>G) occurred in vivo.
Next, we selected PEO1 cells in cisplatin-containing medium
(4 Amol/L) for 4 weeks in vitro and obtained 11 clones out of two
million cells. Eight of them restored BRCA2 protein (Fig. 2A) and
had a secondary BRCA2 mutation (5192A>T; Fig. 2B and C). This
mutation is a single bp substitution that changed the stop codon
into an amino acid coding triplet leading to the restoration of the
open reading frame (5192A>T; 5193C>G, Y1655L).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

The eight BRCA2-restored PEO1 clones and PEO4 were cisplatinand AG14361-resistant compared with parental PEO1 (Fig. 2D),
consistent with functionality of the restored BRCA2 proteins. Two of
the three clones without BRCA2 restoration (C4-4 and C4-11) were
cisplatin resistant, whereas the other clone (C4-13) was only slightly
resistant. One of the cisplatin-resistant clones without restored BRCA2
(C4-4) was still sensitive to AG14361, consistent with the lack of
BRCA2. Two cisplatin-resistant clones without restored BRCA2 (C4-11
and C4-13) showed intermediate sensitivity to AG14361, suggesting
the existence of alternative mechanisms for the drug resistance.
Next, we analyzed the homologous recombination-based DNA
double strand break repair function of the novel BRCA2 proteins
using an I-SceI–dependent DR-GFP reporter assay in BRCA2deficient V-C8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 3A; refs. 16, 17). In
this assay, GFP expression correlates with the occurrence of
homologous recombination. Transfection of a wild-type BRCA2
construct or constructs with the secondary BRCA2 mutations
[(5192A>T; 5193C>G, Y1655L) or (5193C>T, Y1655Y)] resulted in
7- to 8-fold more GFP-positive cells compared with control,
whereas transfection of the 5193C>T (Y1655X) mutant construct
resulted in impaired induction of GFP-positive cells. These results
indicate that the secondary-mutated BRCA2 proteins efficiently
promote homologous recombination.

Secondary BRCA2 Mutation in Ovarian Cancer

Functional BRCA2 is required for ionizing radiation (IR)–induced
RAD51 foci formation (4). Consistently, in parental PEO1 cells and the
three BRCA2-nonrestored PEO1 clones, IR-induced RAD51 foci
formation was severely impaired (Fig. 3B). In contrast, it was restored
in the eight BRCA2-restored PEO1 clones and in PEO4, again suggesting that the secondary-mutated BRCA2 proteins are functional.
Next, we depleted BRCA2 in two BRCA2-restored clones (C4-2
and C4-5) and PEO4 by siRNA transfection (Fig. 4). The BRCA2depleted cells became sensitive to cisplatin/AG14361, indicating
that the restored BRCA2 proteins are critical for the acquired
cisplatin/AG14361 resistance. We confirmed this result using

another BRCA2 siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, BRCA2
siRNA had no effect on drug sensitivity of a BRCA2-nonrestored
clone C4-11 and parental PEO1 (Fig. 4).
We also selected PEO1 cells in AG14361-containing medium
(4 Amol/L) for 4 weeks and obtained three clones out of one million
cells. These clones restored BRCA2 protein, harbored the same
secondary mutation (5192A>T), showed restored RAD51 foci
formation, and were resistant to both cisplatin and AG14361
(Supplementary Fig. S3A–D). Depletion of BRCA2 sensitized these
clones to cisplatin and AG14361 (Supplementary Figs. S3E–F and S4),
indicating that restored BRCA2 was critical for the drug resistance.

PEO4 and C4-2 cells were AG14361-sensitive compared with control siRNA–treated cells (P < 0.05; LD50 data were compared by unpaired t test). BRCA2 siRNA
(#1)–treated C4-5 cells tended to be AG14361-sensitive compared with control siRNA–treated cells, but the difference is not statistically significant (P = 0.067).
BRCA2 siRNA (#1) had no effect on AG14361 sensitivity of PEO1 and C4-11 cells; points, mean (n = 3); bars, SE.

These findings provide compelling evidence that restoration
of functional BRCA2 protein by secondary BRCA2 mutation has
a critical role in acquired platinum/PARP inhibitor resistance
of BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinomas. This concept has two
important clinical implications. First, it suggests the importance
of testing BRCA2 mutation status in recurrent ovarian carcinomas in BRCA2 mutation carriers to predict their response to
platinum and PARP inhibitors. Second, it provides a theoretical
basis for a strategy to overcome platinum/PARP inhibitor resistance. If the mechanism of resistance is restoration of BRCA2,
inhibiting BRCA2 function is a logical way to resensitize the tumor
to the drugs.
We may be able to apply the concept to other genes regulating DNA repair, such as BRCA1 and ATM. Indeed, secondary
mutations of BRCA1 occur in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer
with platinum resistance (18). Whether we can apply the concept to sporadic ovarian carcinomas with reduced BRCA1 or

BRCA2 expression (19) is also an important issue to be addressed
in the future.
