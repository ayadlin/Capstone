Abstract
Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is implicated in bone development and cellular transformation. Here we show
that inhibition of Hh pathway activity inhibits tumor growth through effects on the microenvironment.
Pharmacologic inhibition of the Hh effector Smoothened (Smo) increased trabecular bone in vivo and
inhibited osteoclastogenesis in vitro. In addition, enhanced Hh signaling due to heterozygosity of the Hh
inhibitory receptor Patched (Ptch1þ/) increased bone resorption, suggesting direct regulation of osteoclast
(OC) activity by the Hh pathway. Ptch1þ/ mice had increased bone metastatic and subcutaneous tumor
growth, suggesting that increased Hh activation in host cells promoted tumor growth. Subcutaneous growth
of Hh-resistant tumor cells was inhibited by LDE225, a novel orally bioavailable SMO antagonist, consistent
with effects on tumor microenvironment. Knockdown of the Hh ligand Sonic Hh (SHH) in these cells
decreased subcutaneous tumor growth and decreased stromal cell production of interleukin-6, indicating
that tumor-derived Hh ligands stimulated tumor growth in a paracrine fashion. Together our ﬁndings show
that inhibition of the Hh pathway can reduce tumor burden, regardless of tumor Hh responsiveness, through
effects on tumor cells, OCs, and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment. Hh may be a promising
therapeutic target for solid cancers and bone metastases. Cancer Res; 72(4); 897–907. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays critical roles in
epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cell differentiation
during embryonic development (1, 2), adult tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis (3, 4). In the absence of ligand, the Hh
receptor Patched (PTCH) inhibits the activator Smoothened
(SMO). Upon ligand binding to PTCH, SMO is released, resulting in pathway activation and transcription of target genes,
including Gli1, Gli2, and Ptch1 (5, 6). Cyclopamine, a naturally
occurring Hh inhibitor and SMO antagonist, ﬁrst highlighted

the importance of Hh signaling. Several next-generation analogs with increased speciﬁcity and tolerability (ref. 7; including
GDC-0449, LDE225, and IPI-926) exert antitumor effects in a
subset of cancer cells and are currently in clinical trials for a
wide variety of tumors (8–10).
The Hh signaling pathway plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and progression in many tumor types. Mutations
leading to ligand-independent Hh pathway activation have
been linked to basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma (11,
12), whereas overexpression of the Hh ligand Sonic Hh (Shh) or
mutations in Hh signaling genes (Smo, Ptch1, Gli1, and Gli2)
have been implicated in the emergence and progression of
numerous epithelial cancers, including breast, skin, esophagus,
stomach, pancreas, liver, lung, and prostate (11, 13, 14). Hh
inhibition via cyclopamine suppressed proliferation of breast
carcinoma cell lines and decreased Gli1 (15, 16). These effects
are not limited to primary tumors, as inhibition of the Hh
pathway decreased lung and liver metastases in a mouse
pancreatic cancer model together with gemcitabine (17, 18).
In addition to direct effects on tumor cell growth, Hh
signaling within the host stromal microenvironment also controls tumor progression. Mice with a targeted disruption of the
Hh inhibitory receptor Ptch1 develop ductal hyperplasia (15).
Interestingly, it was disruption of Ptch1 in mammary stroma,
rather than in mammary epithelium, that led to the ductal
changes, suggesting an indirect effect of Hh signaling on tumorinitiating cells. Furthermore, paracrine Hh activation in hostderived stromal cells leads to increased tumor growth (19–21)
and is necessary to support the growth of stromal-dependent B

cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma (22). Increased intratumoral expression of Hh target gene Gli2 increased production of
osteoclast (OC)-activating factor PTHrP in breast cancer cells,
linking Hh signaling with tumor-induced osteolysis (23). However, in certain breast cancer cell lines that are relatively
resistant to Hh signaling modulation, Gli2 expression can be
induced through TGFb signaling independent of Hh resulting in
enhanced osteolysis (24). Together, these studies provide a
strong rationale for evaluating Hh signaling as a therapeutic
target for cancer and metastasis.
The Hh pathway is critical to osteoblast (OB) differentiation
and chondrocyte proliferation during embryonic endochondral bone development (25, 26). Targeted disruption of several
Hh pathway genes result in profound effects on bone development (27–29). Postnatal interruption of the Hh pathway
leads to trabecular bone abnormalities and disrupted long
bone formation (30, 31). The effects of Hh signaling interruption on adult bone have not been fully elucidated. Mice with
conditional deletion of Ptch1 in mature OB using osteocalcinCre show increased production of RANK ligand (RANKL) by
OB, which indirectly increased OC activity and bone loss (32).
However, mice with heterozygous germline deletion of Ptch1
(Ptch1þ/) show increased bone mass, with enhanced bone
formation being dominant to increased in vivo OC number and
resorption (33). The discrepancy between the 2 models
remains to be fully resolved. Interestingly, direct effects of Hh
pathway signaling on primary OC have not been reported.
We hypothesized that disruption of Hh signaling would
block tumor growth both directly, by targeting intratumoral
survival signaling, and indirectly, by altering the host microenvironment. Indeed, OC- and OB-derived proteins, such as
TGFb, can enhance growth of bone-invading tumor cells (34),
and we propose that the effects of Hh signaling in both tumor
and host cells may enhance metastatic growth. In this study, we
show that disruption of the Hh pathway in adult nontumor–
bearing mice increased trabecular bone in part through
reduced OC function and identiﬁed a cell-autonomous role
of Hh signaling during osteoclastogenesis. Employing pharmacologic inhibitors, we show that disruption of the Hh
pathway decreased subcutaneous and bone tumor burden
in vivo. Mice heterozygous for Ptch1, resulting in systemically
enhanced Hh signaling, also had increased tumor burden.
Moreover, Hh inhibitors decreased subcutaneous tumor burden in a cell line that is resistant to direct cytotoxic effects due
to reduced SMO expression (24), showing indirect antitumor
effects of targeting cells of the host microenvironment. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 cells produce Hh ligands and knockdown of SHH decreased tumor growth through paracrine
effects on stromal cell production of growth factors including
interleukin (IL)-6. Thus, Hh inhibitors represent promising
therapeutics due to their ability to target both tumor cells
and the protumor microenvironment.

as previously described (17); LDE225 (20 mg/kg) once daily for
21 days orally.
Microcomputed tomography
Postmortem, tibiae and femurs were scanned (mCT-40;
Scanco Medical) and evaluated as described previously
(36).
Bone histology and in vitro OC quantiﬁcation
Decalciﬁed and parafﬁn-embedded sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain or tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase (TRAP). Images were taken with an Eclipse
TE300 inverted microscope (Nikon) using the 4 (H&E, TRAP,
in vitro OC) or 40 (actin rings, pits) objectives. Histomorphometry was done using BioQuant Osteo.
Serum CTX and osteocalcin
Serum from overnight-fasted mice was measured by ELISA
for CTX (RatLaps; Immunodiagnostic Systems) and osteocalcin (Biomedical Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

(Roche) and supernatant harvested 48 hours later. Cells were
infected with lentivirus-containing supernatant for 4 hours
in the presence of 10 mg/mL protamine sulfate. For
ex vivo Smo excision, Smoﬂ/ﬂ macrophages were infected
with virus produced from pHR'EF-Cre-WPRE-SIN ('CRE') or
pHR'EF-GFP-WPRE-SIN ('GFP') virus in the presence of 50
ng/mL M-CSF. Forty-eight hours after infection, macrophages were screened for excision efﬁciency and differentiated into OC. For SHH knockdown, short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) constructs in pLKOpuro vectors were obtained
from the Washington University Genome Institute and
Children's Discovery Institute RNAi Consortium. (shLacZ–
CGCGATCGTAATCACCCGAGT; shSHH-2–GCTGATGACTCAGAGGTGTAA; shSHH-3–CATATCCACTGCTCGGTGAAA).
Transduced cells were selected with 2 mg/mL puromycin.

In vivo bioluminescence imaging
Imaging was done on a IVIS 100 device (Caliper Life
Sciences) as previously described (36), except that for subcutaneous tumor image analysis, a software-deﬁned contour
region of interest was used to measure total photon ﬂux.
MTT viability assay
A total of 5,000 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates
with indicated concentrations of drug. After 48 hours, 10 mL
MTT (Sigma) was added for 4 hours. HCl/isopropanol was
added to measure absorbance at 570 and 630 nm.
Bone marrow chimeras
Recipient mice were lethally irradiated (1,000 rads). Twentyfour hours later, 1  106 donor whole bone marrow cells were
transferred intravenously into recipient mice. After 4 weeks,
hematopoietic reconstitution with the donor genotype was
conﬁrmed by PCR of peripheral blood and mice were challenged with the B16 tumor.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), treated
with DNaseI, and reverse transcribed using iScript (Bio-Rad). A
no-RT control was included in each assay. Quantitative PCR
was done using SsoFast EVA Green Supermix (Bio-Rad).
Experiments were conducted in duplicate for both the
target and the endogenous gene (GAPDH for OC, cyclophilin
for BMSC and MDA-MB-231) used for normalization. Relative
quantiﬁcation of the target gene expression was calculated by
the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method: 2DDCt in which
DCt ¼ Cttarget gene  Ctendogenous gene and DDCt ¼ DCtvehicle 
DCttreated (see Supplementary Methods for primer sequences).

Bone marrow stromal cell culture
To generate bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), whole bone
marrow of WT C57BL/6 mice was cultured in aMEM with 20%
FBS for 7 days and adherent cells replated at 5  105 cells/mL.
At conﬂuence, recombinant murine SHH (Ebioscience) or a
50:50 dilution of tumor cell conditioned media (CM, from 3 
106 cells, 24 hours in serum-free media) was added and
cultured for an additional 72 hours in aMEM with 2.5% FBS.

Actin ring and bone resorption assay
A total of 3,000 day 3 pre-OCs differentiated as above were
plated on bovine bone slices in 96-well plates. At day 6, actin
rings and resorption lacunae were visualized as previously
described (36).

Statistical analysis
Experiments were analyzed using 2-tailed Student t test or
ANOVA using Prism5 (GraphPad). Errors bars represent SEM.
Results were considered to reach signiﬁcance at P  0.05 and
are indicated with an asterisk ( ).

BrdUrd proliferation assay
A total of 2.5  104 cells/mL were plated with indicated drug
concentrations. Cells were labeled with BrdUrd for 24 hours
and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Cell Proliferation ELISA; Roche).

Results

Immunoblotting
Fifty micrograms of protein was separated on 8% SDSpolyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane and incubated with p-AKT-Substrate,
p-ERK, or total-ERK rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), followed by horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antirabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Bioscience). Speciﬁc
bands were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Loading control was b-actin (clone AC15; Sigma).
Tumor models
Intracardiac (1  105 cells) and intratibial (1  104 cells)
tumor cell injections were carried out as previously
described (36). For subcutaneous injections 1  106 (4T1
and B16) or 2  106 (MDA-MB-231) tumor cells were injected
in a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) as previously
described (36, 38).

Cyclopamine increased bone mass and suppressed OC
function in nontumor–bearing mice
To understand the effect of Hh signaling on adult nontumor–bearing bone, we administered the Hh inhibitor
cyclopamine to adult mice by twice daily by oral gavage for
14 days and observed increased trabecular bone volume and
thickness (Fig. 1A–D). Despite a nonsigniﬁcant increase in
OC number (Fig. 1E), serum CTX, a marker of osteoclastic
bone resorption, was signiﬁcantly decreased with cyclopamine (Fig. 1F). Serum osteocalcin, a marker of OB activity,
showed a nonsigniﬁcant reduction after Hh inhibition (Fig.
1G). Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of Hh signaling led to
increased trabecular bone mass, with evidence of decreased
OC function in vivo.
Disruption of Hedgehog signaling inhibited ex vivo
osteoclastogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner
To test whether Hh signaling had direct effects on OC
formation, we disrupted Smoothened by transducing Smoﬂ/ﬂ
bone marrow macrophages (BMM) with a lentivirus expressing
Cre-recombinase (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and subjected the

cells to osteoclastogenesis. We observed a decrease in OC size
and number after Smo excision compared with green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-transduced control cells (Fig. 2A and B).
Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of SMO with cyclopamine (Supplementary Fig. S1B) or LDE225 (Fig. 2C) resulted in
a dose-dependent decrease in TRAPþ multinucleated OC
formation. Likewise, LDE225 reduced the mRNA abundance
of the Hh target Gli1 and of the OC differentiation markers
NFATc1 (Nfatc1), b3 integrin (Itgb3), and cathepsin K (Ctsk; Fig.
2D). Furthermore, treatment of pre-OCs with recombinant
murine SHH increased mRNA transcripts of Gli1, Nfatc1, and
Itgb3, suggesting that Hh stimulation enhanced signaling pathways involved in OC differentiation (Fig. 2E). These results
suggested that Hh signaling through SMO is critical to normal
OC formation in a cell-autonomous fashion.

phospho-AKT substrates (p-AKTs) in day 3 Ptch1þ/ pre-OC
(Fig. 3E). However, we did not observe a difference in the
expression of phosphorylated ERK in BMMs (Supplementary
Fig. S2B), nor in rate of apoptosis of Ptch1þ/ OCs (Supplementary Fig. S2C). From these data, we concluded that
enhanced Hh signaling promoted macrophage proliferation
and OC function.

expression of the downstream target Gli1 was also signiﬁcantly
decreased with cyclopamine (Fig. 5C). The small molecule SMO
inhibitor GDC-0449 (Supplementary Fig. S3A) also decreased
4T1 viability, whereas tomatidine, an inactive structural analog
of cyclopamine, had no effect (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Compared with vehicle controls, subcutaneous growth of 4T1 cells in
BALB/c mice was signiﬁcantly reduced by cyclopamine (Fig.

tumor growth; however, the speciﬁc contribution of host-targeted SMO antagonism could not be evaluated in this model.

Enhanced Hh signaling due to Ptch1 heterozygosity
indirectly enhanced tumor growth
To examine the possibility that Hh signaling may play a role
in various tissues through mechanisms independent of direct
antitumor actions, we evaluated tumor growth in Ptch1þ/
mice. Following intracardiac injection of osteolytic B16 cells
into immunocompetent C57Bl/6 mice, metastatic bone tumor
burden was signiﬁcantly increased in Ptch1þ/ mice compared
with WT littermates (Fig. 6A–D). We also observed an increase

in subcutaneous B16 tumor burden in Ptch1þ/ mice (Fig. 6E),
suggesting that the tumor-promoting effects of enhanced Hh
signaling in the host are not speciﬁc to the bone environment.
To test whether this was due to cells of hematopoietic origin
(including myeloid and immune cells), we established radiation chimeras of WT and Ptch1þ/ recipient mice reconstituted with reciprocal WT or Ptch1þ/ bone marrow. In both

Antitumor Effect of Hedgehog Inhibition in Host Microenvironment

"sensitive" 4T1 cells could be attributed to direct cytotoxic
effects on the tumor cells (Figs. 4 and 5), effects of SMO
antagonists on growth of "resistant" MDA-MB-231 tumors
would be speciﬁcally due to modulation of the host microenvironment. In nude mice, subcutaneous growth of MDA-MB231 cells was signiﬁcantly reduced by LDE225 (Fig. 7B), showing that Hh inhibition isolated to host cells can modulate
tumor growth.

growth compared with reconstitution with WT bone marrow
(Fig. 6F and G). Flow cytometry showed no signiﬁcant differences in the extent of hematopoietic reconstitution (Supplementary Fig. S4A–C). These data suggested that host Hh
signaling, in part through hematopoietic cells, inﬂuenced
tumor growth indirectly through the microenvironment, independent of direct effects on tumor cells.
MDA-MD-231 breast cancer cells are resistant to direct
cytotoxic effects of Smo antagonists
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells are reported to
have nondetectable levels of Smo transcripts and to be resistant to killing by SMO antagonists (7, 39). In agreement, we did
not observe signiﬁcantly decreased viability even at micromolar concentrations of LDE225 (Fig. 7A). Reports of cytotoxicity
in sensitive tumor cell lines are in the nanomolar range (40),
thus showing relative resistance of this tumor to in vitro
cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, LDE225 treatment did not
decrease the expression of Hh target genes PTCH1 or GLI2 in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). These data
suggested that MDA-MB-231 cells are resistant to direct effects
of pharmacologic Hh inhibition, allowing for a system in which
to examine the microenvironment-targeted effects of SMO
antagonists.
Hh signaling in host microenvironment cells inﬂuence
tumor growth in vivo
To evaluate the roles of Hh inhibition directly on cells
present in the tumor microenvironment, subcutaneous growth
of MDA-MB-231 Hh inhibition "resistant" tumor cell lines was
evaluated. Although the decreased growth of Hh inhibition

Tumor-derived Sonic hedgehog increased tumor growth
through effects on the microenvironment
Although MDA-MB-231 cells are unresponsive to canonical
Hh pathway stimulation, their production of Hh ligands,
particularly SHH (Fig. 7C), could stimulate Hh signaling in
surrounding tissues in a paracrine fashion. To investigate the
effects that tumor-produced Hh ligands have on the microenvironment, SHH expression was decreased in MDA-MB-231
cells by approximately 70% using 2 lentivirally expressed
shRNAs (Fig. 7D). Following knockdown, cells maintained in
vitro proliferation rates similar to parental cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C). In vivo, MDA-shSHH-2 and MDA-shSHH-3
formed signiﬁcantly smaller subcutaneous tumors than parental or control MDA-shLacZ tumors, showing that tumoral
production of Hh ligands can increase growth of tumors that
fail to respond to canonical Hh stimulation in an autocrine
signaling (Fig. 7E).
Stromal cells within the microenvironment produce a
variety of tumor-supporting growth factors. To evaluate the
effects of tumor-derived SHH on stromal cells, we added CM
from parental MDA or MDA-shLacZ cells to murine BMSCs
and found that increased transcription of Gli1 to similar
levels as recombinant Shh (Supplementary Fig. S5D). In
contrast, CM from MDA-shSHH-2 or MDA-shSHH-3 failed
to induce BMSC Gli1, suggesting that Hh signaling was
blunted. BMSC production of IL-6, a protumor and proosteoclastogenic factor, was increased by recombinant SHH
(Fig. 7F). CM from parental MDA or MDA-shLacZ further
induced IL-6 transcription (Fig. 7F) and secretion (Supplementary Fig. S5E) in BMSCs, whereas that of MDA-shSHH-2
or MDA-shSHH-3 cells induced it to a lower extent. Although
tumor cells produce an abundance of factors that affect
numerous stromal cells signaling pathways, this data suggested that BMSC production of IL-6 is due in part to
stimulation of the Hh pathway. These data suggested that
Hh inhibition in host microenvironment cells can reduce
tumor burden indirectly, even when tumor cells themselves
are resistant to direct Hh inhibition.

Discussion
Although the majority of current pharmaceuticals used in
the treatment of cancer directly target tumor cell growth and
survival, a growing body of evidence has shown that many
components of the host microenvironment are critical to
tumorigenesis and represent additional therapeutic targets.
Thus, therapeutic manipulation of this pathway has the potential to decrease tumor growth both through direct and indirect
mechanisms. Intratumoral Hh pathway signaling has been

shown to be vital for the growth and maintenance of many
tumor types (3, 4). However, a number of tumors have been
shown to be refractory to the direct effects of pharmacologic
Hh inhibition with SMO antagonists due to natural or acquired
mutations in Smo (24, 41) or ampliﬁcation of downstream
effector Gli2 (40, 42).
Previous reports have shown that tumor growth was
blunted when paracrine Hh signaling was inhibited in stromal components of the microenvironment, even when the
tumor itself is SMO independent (19, 22, 43). The Hh
inhibitor GDC-0449 induced dramatic reductions in the
growth of tumors with activating Hh mutations (44, 45).
Interestingly, GDC-0449 has little direct effect on tumors
without Hh mutations; however, it signiﬁcantly blocked Hh
signaling in tumor stroma and decreased tumor burden (46).
In this article, we found that the SMO antagonist LDE225
had potent in vivo antitumor activity in MDA-MB-231, an
aggressive breast tumor cell line relatively resistant to Hh
pathway modulation due to undetectable levels of SMO
(7, 39). Furthermore, we show that tumoral production of
the Hh ligand SHH supported growth of subcutaneous
tumors in vivo. We provide evidence that this effect is due
to paracrine stimulation of the Hh signaling pathway in
stromal cells, resulting in the increased production of

904

growth factors, including, but not limited to, IL-6. We also
show that enhanced Hh signaling in the host environment of
Ptch1þ/ mice promoted growth of bone metastases and
subcutaneous tumors, in part, through contributions of
hematopoietically derived cells, including, but not limited
to, immune cells and OC. Although the mechanisms underlying the described phenotypes still need to be further
elucidated, these data underscore a role for Hh inhibition
in cells of the microenvironment, even in Hh-unresponsive
tumor cells, and highlights the potential for increased clinical utility of Hh inhibition in cancer treatment.
In addition to its role in tumorigenesis, Hh signaling is
crucial to proper development and maintenance of many
host tissues including bone (25, 26). However, studies into
the role of Hh signaling in postnatal bone have yielded
disparate results. Enhancing Hh signaling through germline
Ptch1 heterozygosity resulted in increased bone density (33),
whereas conditional homozygous deletion of Ptch1 in
mature OB decreased bone density (32). Both groups
observed increases in bone formation and resorption; however, the effects of Hh signaling on the OC were attributed to
be indirect via increased OB expression of RANKL. Here we
report a previously unrecognized cell-autonomous role for
Hh signaling in the differentiation of bone-resorbing OCs.

Antitumor Effect of Hedgehog Inhibition in Host Microenvironment

We found that genetic and pharmacologic Hh inhibition
decreased OC differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, transcription of target gene Gli1 and key genes involved in OC
differentiation (Nfatc1, Itgb3, and Ctsk) were reduced with
Hh inhibition. These results are in agreement with a recent
report showing that RAW cell differentiation into OCs could
be inhibited with cyclopamine (47). Ptch1þ/ mice, in which
Hh signaling is enhanced, are known to have increased bone
mineral density and OB activity (33). Concurrently, we
observed that Ptch1þ/ mice also had enhanced OC activity
in vitro. Together, these data suggest a direct, cell-autonomous role for Hh signaling in the OC.
We report that systemic Hh inhibition with cyclopamine
increased bone density of adult WT mice, whereas a previous
study found decreased bone density (33). Several differences
between treatment protocols (i.e., administration and dosing), and importantly, recognized gender differences in bone
biology, may explain these seemingly paradoxical results.
The previous study dosed male mice with 10 mg/kg cyclopamine intraperitoneally once a day (33), whereas we used
25 mg/kg orally twice daily in females. Twice daily admin-

istration and/or increased drug dosage could result in more
continuous or potent inhibition of Hh and OC function,
leading to increased bone density. Similarly, continuous
administration of parathyroid hormone has catabolic effects
on bone, whereas intermittent dosing is anabolic (48). Hh
signaling in bone homeostasis seems tightly regulated by the
strength of signaling, as suggested in discrepant results
between heterozygous (33) and homozygous loss of Ptch1
(32). Overall, our results and those of others (32, 33) suggest
that level and regulation of Hh signaling in the bone microenvironment is important to properly regulate the extent of
bone formation and resorption occurring under nonpathologic conditions.
As OC and tumor cells are both known to produce growth
factors that support the activity of the other, the bone
microenvironment is a hotspot of tumor metastasis, known
as "the vicious cycle" (34). Thus, blunting tumor-driven
manipulation of bone remodeling and turnover can indirectly decrease the expansion of tumor in bone. Here we
show that mice treated with cyclopamine had decreased
tumor burden in bone. However, as subcutaneous tumor

growth was also decreased, the antitumor activity of Smo
antagonists was due at least partially to non-bone cell
effects, including those directly on tumor cells and on host
stromal cells.
In conclusion, our data show that components of the Hh
signaling pathway are promising therapeutic targets for
cancer as they have the ability to decrease tumor growth
both by exerting direct antitumor effects and by making the
host microenvironment less hospitable to tumors. Hh inhibition has now been shown to act on a variety of host
microenvironment cells, including stroma, hematopoietic
cells, and vasculature (49, 50) to contribute to the overall
therapeutic effect. In addition to these effects on solid
tumors, targeting the Hh pathway is a particularly attractive
target for the treatment of bone metastases as it may prove
beneﬁcial in interrupting the vicious cycle of OB, OC, and
tumor cells and effectively decrease both tumor burden and
tumor-associated osteolysis, which are linked to high rates
of mortality and morbidity. As several small-molecule Hh
signaling inhibitors are currently being clinically evaluated
for efﬁcacy in a variety of tumor types, their effect on Hh
signaling in cells of the tumor microenvironment warrants
active investigation.
