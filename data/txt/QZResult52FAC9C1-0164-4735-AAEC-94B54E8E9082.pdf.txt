Analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results Registries

BACKGROUND: Survival after a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosis remained static during the several decades
before 1999. We hypothesized that the progressive increase in temozolomide use for GBM treatment that began in
1999 in the United States would be paralleled by a corresponding improvement in survival. METHODS: We included
19,674 GBM cases, ages 20 years or greater, diagnosed 1993 to 2007 in the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database. We used proportional hazards models to calculate calendar period hazard
ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for demographic covariates. We compared survival across
periods using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Starting with cases diagnosed in 1999 to 2001, we observed a progressive decrease in HRs compared with cases diagnosed in 1993 to 1995. The multivariate-adjusted HR for 2005 to
2007 versus 1993 to 1995 was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.65-0.72). Age-stratified analyses revealed that this progressive
decrease occurred in all age groups except 80þ years. Two-year survival increased from 7% among cases diagnosed
in 1993 to 1995 and 1996 to 1998 to 9% among cases diagnosed in 1999 to 2001, 13% in 2002 to 2004, and 17% in
2005 to 2007. The disparity in survival between young and old patients increased in the temozolomide era, with 2year survival of 39% among cases diagnosed at ages 20 to 44 years and 1% among cases diagnosed at 80þ years in
2005 to 2007. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a modest, but meaningful, population-based survival improvement
for GBM patients in the United States. Widespread adoption of temozolomide represents the most likely explanation, although other treatment advances, such as increased extent of surgical resection, also may have played a role.

INTRODUCTION

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant form of brain cancer, has a dismal prognosis.1 In the

several decades before 1999, survival after a diagnosis of GBM remained static.2-4 However, in 1999, temozolomide
(TMZ), an oral alkylating agent that penetrates the blood-brain barrier, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma.5 Between 1999 and 2005, off-label use of TMZ for treatment of GBM (both first-line and after relapse) became increasingly widespread6-10 due to the drug’s ease of
administration and tolerability,7,11 promotion of its off-label use by the manufacturer,12 and the lack of an attractive
chemotherapy alternative.11
Then, in 2005, a landmark phase 3 trial demonstrated that surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant TMZ, followed by adjuvant TMZ, resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful survival benefit
compared with therapy with surgery followed by radiotherapy, with minimal added toxicity.13 Median survival was 14.6

months in the group that received radiotherapy plus
TMZ (with 2-year survival of 26.5%) compared with median survival of 12.1 months in the group that received
radiotherapy alone (with 2-year survival of 10.4%). In
March 2005, the FDA approved this new regimen for
patients with newly diagnosed GBM.14 Maximum safe
surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy with concomitant TMZ, followed by adjuvant TMZ, became the new
standard of care for first-line treatment.
However, patients enrolled in clinical trials differ
from and may have better outcomes than patients treated
outside the clinical trial setting due to selection of patients
with better prognoses for clinical trials.15 Participants in
the landmark TMZ trial were required to be between ages
18 and 70; to have a relatively high-performance status; to
have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function;
and to have received a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids (if on corticosteroids) for at least 14 days before
randomization.13 Thus, the level of benefit found in the
landmark trial may not translate into the same level of
benefit in an unselected general population of GBM
patients. The level of benefit in a general population compared with clinical trial patients may be eroded further by
possible suboptimal access to or delivery of the standard
treatment. Even after a phase 3 trial has established efficacy for a new treatment, it is essential to use observational
databases to determine its ‘‘real-world’’ effectiveness.
In the current study, we utilized data from the population-based cancer registries of the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
Program to determine whether survival among adult GBM
patients has improved in the United States since the advent
of TMZ. We hypothesized that starting in 1999 we would
observe a progressive improvement in survival, corresponding with the increasing prevalence of TMZ use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We utilized data from the SEER Program populationbased cancer registries (SEER Research Data [19732007], released April 2010, based on the November 2009
submission).16 These data are available to the public
from the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer
Control and Population Sciences, Surveillance Research
Program, Cancer Statistics Branch, subject to a Research
Data Agreement. The Yale School of Medicine Human
Investigation Committee considered this research to be
exempt from review.

Figure 1. Selection of the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
analytic cohort from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results Program (SEER) database.

We defined GBM as a malignant brain neoplasm
(International Classification of Diseases for Oncology,
third edition [ICD-O-3] topography codes C710-C719
and behavior code 3) with ICD-O-3 morphology codes of
9440 (glioblastoma, NOS), 9441 (giant cell glioblastoma),
or 9442 (gliosarcoma).17 Our analyses included adult
GBM cases (age at diagnosis 20 years or greater) diagnosed
between January 1993 and December 2007. Cases diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 were from the SEER 13
Registries Database (Alaska Native, Atlanta, Connecticut,
Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, Los Angeles, New Mexico, Rural
Georgia, San Francisco-Oakland, San Jose-Monterey,
Seattle-Puget Sound, and Utah). Cases diagnosed between
2000 and 2007 were from the SEER 17 Registries Database (SEER 13 plus Greater California, Kentucky, Louisiana, and New Jersey). The SEER 13 registries cover about
14% of the total US population and the SEER 17 registries
cover about 26% of the total US population.18
There were a total of 24,793 adult GBM cases diagnosed between January 1993 and December 2007 in these
SEER registries. However, we restricted our cohort to
microscopically confirmed cases experiencing their first
primary cancer and not diagnosed by death certificate or

autopsy only (Fig. 1). Epidemiologists and neuropathologists have reached a consensus that a microscopically confirmed diagnosis of GBM is likely to be valid without
further centralized pathology review.19 Our final analytic
cohort consisted of 19,674 GBM cases.
Data Analysis and Statistical Methods
The study endpoint was overall survival. The cause of
death for patients diagnosed with GBM is likely GBM
due to their characteristic short duration of survival. The
SEER dataset provides follow-up time in number of completed months. We measured overall survival time as the
number of completed months from the date of GBM diagnosis to the earliest of the date of death, date last known
to be alive, or the follow-up cutoff date of December 31,
2007. Those living past this date were censored.
We grouped calendar year of diagnosis, the primary
predictor variable, into 5 3-year periods (1993-1995,
1996-1998, 1999-2001, 2002-2004, and 2005-2007).
Because age is an important prognostic factor for GBM
survival,1 we performed age-stratified analyses with age
groups 20 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, 65 to 79 years, and
80þ years. We also performed analyses stratified by first
course of surgical or radiotherapy treatment. Surgical
treatment was recoded from SEER codes to resection, biopsy, or unknown. Radiotherapy treatment was recoded
to radiotherapy (external beam), none, or other (implants
or isotopes)/unknown. The SEER database does not provide data on chemotherapy treatment.
We used SAS version 9.2 for all analyses. We used
Proc Phreg to estimate calendar period hazard rate ratios
(HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression models. In multivariate models we adjusted for
age (5-year age groups), sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
White, Hispanic White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander,
American Indian/Alaskan Native, and other/unknown),
and marital status (married, not married [single, widowed, separated, or divorced], and unknown). We
included marital status because it has been shown to influence overall survival in GBM patients.20,21 In age-stratified analyses, we continued to include age as a covariate
with 5-year age groups. To determine a P value for heterogeneity, we entered the appropriate crossproduct term
into the model and conducted a likelihood ratio test for its
addition, with the appropriate degrees of freedom.
We used Proc Lifetest to generate Kaplan-Meier survival curves and to calculate the percent of subjects alive at
2 years and 5 years (and 95% CI), median survival (and

periods (stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital
status). The SEER dataset provides follow-up time in
number of completed months (not days). Cases who survived at least n months, but fewer than n þ 1 months,
would have n completed months of survival. On the average, these cases survived ‘‘n.5’’ months. For the purpose of
calculating median survival we therefore added 0.5
months to the result derived from completed months.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the GBM cases. Eighty-seven percent (17,110) of
the 19,674 cases died and 13% (2564) were censored.
Cases diagnosed in 2005 to 2007 had a substantially lower
proportion of deaths than cases diagnosed in earlier time
periods at least partially because follow-up time was the
shortest for these cases (maximum of 35 completed
month). There were considerably more cases diagnosed in
1999 to 2001, 2002 to 2004, and 2005 to 2007 compared
with 1993 to 1995 and 1996 to 1998 because after 1999
cases were included from 4 additional cancer registries
(SEER 17 registries vs SEER 13 registries). Most cases
were non-Hispanic White and were diagnosed between
ages 45 and 79 years. The majority of cases were male.
The first course of treatment included surgical resection
for 77% of patients and radiotherapy for 73% of patients.
In a Cox proportional hazards model including all
cases, the calendar period effect was homogeneous according to sex (P value for heterogeneity ¼ .76), race/ethnicity
(P value for heterogeneity ¼ .57), and marital status (P
value for heterogeneity ¼ .66), but was heterogeneous
according to age (P value for heterogeneity ¼ .016), indicating a difference in the period effect across age groups.
Table 2 shows calendar period HRs for death for all
ages combined and stratified by age group. We also examined ages 20 to 69 years because the original landmark
trial had an upper age limit of 70 years.13 The reference
calendar period was 1993 to 1995. The risk of death
among cases diagnosed in 1996 to 1998 did not differ significantly from the risk of death among cases diagnosed in
1993 to 1995. However, starting in 1999 to 2001, when
TMZ came into use, we observed a progressive decrease in
multivariate-adjusted HRs through 2005 to 2007, for all
ages combined (20þ) and for the age groups 20 to 44
years, 45 to 64 years, and 65 to 79 years. The HR for calendar period 2005 to 2007 was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.65-0.72)
for all ages combined, and was similar for each of the age
groups 20 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and 65 to 79 years.
However, the HR for the age 80þ years age group did not
differ from 1.00 across periods (P ¼ .48). For the age

Univariate HR (95% CI)

Results (not shown) were essentially unchanged
when further adjusting for SEER registry, when restricting
analyses to the SEER 13 registries, or when including
cases that were not first primary cancers or were not
microscopically confirmed. All statistical tests were 2
sided with a ¼ 0.05.

range 20 to 69 years, the HR for calendar period 2005 to
2007 was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.60-0.68).
When we added the first course of treatment variables to the model, we found that the period effect was heterogeneous according to both surgery (P ¼ .0001) and
radiotherapy (P < .0001). We therefore examined multivariate-adjusted calendar period HRs stratified by first
course of treatment (Table 3) and found the period effect
to be most pronounced among those treated with both
surgical resection and radiotherapy. In this subgroup of
11,546 cases (59%), the HR for those diagnosed in 2005
to 2007 was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.57-0.66). Among the 1482
patients (8%) who received biopsy only, the HR did not
differ from 1.00 across periods (P ¼ .63).
Table 4 shows 2-year and median survival by calendar period, for all cases and for cases treated with both surgical resection and radiotherapy. Consistent with the
proportional hazards analyses, among all cases, survival
for all ages combined did not improve appreciably during
the pre-TMZ era (between 1993 to 1995 and 1996 to
1998), but did increase steadily starting in 1999 to 2001,
when TMZ came into use. Thus, between 1993 to 1995
and 2005 to 2007, 2-year survival increased from 7% to
17% and median survival increased from 7.5 months to
9.5 months. The stratified log-rank test indicated that the
difference in survival among periods was highly statistically significant (P < .0001).
Among all cases, in each age group except for the
oldest, survival increased progressively after 1998.
Between 1993 to 1995 and 2005 to 2007, median survival
increased from 13.5 months to 18.5 months in the 20 to
44 years age group, from 9.5 months to 12.5 months in

the 45 to 64 years age group, and from 5.5 months to 6.5
months in the 65 to 79 years age group. For each of these
age groups, the stratified log-rank test was highly statistically significant (P < .0001).
Age-group-specific Kaplan-Meier curves comparing
cases diagnosed in 2005 to 2007 with cases diagnosed in
the pre-TMZ era (1993 to 1998) clearly demonstrate the
improvement in survival (Fig. 2) for each of these age
groups. However, survival did not improve in the 80þ
years age group, with median survival remaining constant
at 3.5 months (P ¼ .39).
As expected, survival among cases treated with both
surgical resection and radiotherapy was superior to survival among all cases. For cases treated with both resection
and radiotherapy, between 1993 to 1995 and 2005 to
2007, median survival increased from 10.5 months to
13.5 months for all ages combined, from 15.5 months to
21.5 months in the 20 to 44 years age group, from 11.5
months to 15.5 months in the 45 to 64 years age group,
and from 8.5 months to 10.5 months in the 65 to 79 years
age group. Survival did not improve in the 80þ years age
group (P ¼ .48).
For the age range 20 to 69 years, comparable to the
age range in the landmark trial, among all cases diagnosed
in 2005 to 2007, 2-year survival was 22% and median survival was 12.5 months. For cases treated with both surgical resection and radiotherapy, 2-year survival in 2005 to
2007 was 28% and median survival was 16.5 months.
Age group 20 to 44 years was the only age group
with appreciable 5-year survival, which increased between
1993 to 1998 and 1999 to 2004 (data not shown in table).
For all cases in this age group, 5-year survival was 12%

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier survival plots for glioblastoma multiforme cases according to year of diagnosis and age. The x-axes indicate completed months of follow-up. SEER provides follow-up time in number of completed months. Cases who survived at least
n months, but fewer than n þ 1 months, would have n completed months of survival, which corresponds with ‘‘n.5’’ months, on average. Thus, the probability of surviving at least 2 years (24 completed months), for example, represents the probability of surviving at least 24.5 months, on average. Age group: (A) 20 to 44 years. (B) 45 to 64 years. (C) 65 to 79 years. (D) 80þ years.

11% (95% CI, 8%-15%) in 1996 to 1998, 17% (95%
CI, 13%-20%) in 1999 to 2001, and 16% (95% CI,
13%-20%) in 2002 to 2004. For cases in age group 20 to
44 years treated with both surgical resection and radiotherapy, 5-year survival was 14% (95% CI, 10%-20%)
for cases diagnosed in 1993 to 1995, 13% (95% CI, 9%18%) in 1996 to 1998, 20% (95% CI, 16%-25%) in
1999 to 2001, and 19% (95% CI, 15%-23%) in 2002 to
2004. Because the maximum follow-up among cases diagnosed in 2005 to 2007 was only 35 completed months,
we were unable to estimate 5-year survival for cases diagnosed in this calendar period.

DISCUSSION
We observed a modest, but meaningful, progressive
improvement in survival of population-based GBM

patients in the United States, starting with cases diagnosed
in the 1999 to 2001 calendar period, when off-label use of
TMZ for GBM treatment commenced (whether concurrent with first course of radiotherapy, adjuvant, and/or after relapse), and continuing through the 2005 to 2007
calendar period, when maximal safe surgical resection followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant TMZ followed
by adjuvant TMZ became the undisputed new standard
of care for first-line treatment of GBM. In the age range
comparable to the landmark trial (20 to 69 years), the 2year survival of 22% and the median survival of 12.5
months among cases diagnosed in 2005 to 2007 were less
favorable than the 2-year survival of 26.5% and the median survival of 14.6 months observed in the landmark
trial.13 It is not surprising that survival in the unselected
US general population of GBM patients, which included
patients with poor prognoses and patients who did not
receive the TMZ standard of care, lagged behind survival

2169

in the landmark trial. However, among our populationbased cases treated with both surgical resection and radiotherapy, survival compared favorably with survival in the
landmark trial, with 2-year survival of 28% and median
survival of 16.5 months among cases diagnosed in 2005
to 2007.
Although we demonstrated a close ecologic association between improved survival and increasing TMZ
usage, because the SEER database did not include chemotherapy treatment information, we were unable to evaluate whether the patients treated with TMZ were, in fact,
the ones with improved survival. Nevertheless, the
increasing usage of TMZ represents the most obvious explanation for at least the majority of the improvement in
survival. First, the landmark 2005 trial clearly established
the efficacy of TMZ.13 Second, introduction of TMZ was
the major change that occurred in GBM treatment during
the overall period of observation, and there is no doubt
that by 2005 to 2007 most nonelderly patients were being
treated with the TMZ standard of care.22,23 Third, survival improved the most among cases with a first course of
treatment that included both surgical resection and radiotherapy. These were the cases that had the potential to
receive the complete TMZ standard of care regimen
(maximum safe surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy with concomitant TMZ, followed by adjuvant
TMZ). Finally, other smaller studies of patients treated in
the nonclinical trial setting in Europe observed a meaningful survival improvement with TMZ treatment.24-27
We were able to perform gross adjustment for surgery (resection vs biopsy) and for radiotherapy (radiotherapy vs none) during the first course of treatment, but the
data available in the SEER database did not permit finer
adjustment. It is possible that advances in neurosurgical
techniques resulting in greater extent of resection contributed to the improvement in GBM survival.28-32 Other
secular trends in care, such as more aggressive treatment
of tumor recurrence or enhancements in palliative care,
may have contributed as well.33,34 However, we know of
no data on temporal trends in extent of surgical resection
or other changes in care that would allow us to test these
conjectures. It is unlikely that advances in radiotherapy
contributed to the survival improvement, as treatment
with the more advanced technique of intensity-modulated
radiotherapy does not appear to convey a survival benefit
over treatment with conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.35
Other than the introduction of TMZ or other
improvements in GBM treatment, there is no obvious ex-

2170

planation for the observed improvement in GBM survival. To control for potential confounding, we adjusted
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status in the proportional hazards models. The observed survival improvement would be explained if there had been a secular
diagnostic trend, starting in 1999, toward classification of
less aggressive gliomas, previously considered grade III, as
GBMs (grade IV gliomas). However, that the last major
change in diagnostic criteria for GBM occurred with the
1993 revision of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System36
argues against such a ‘‘grade migration’’ starting in 1999.
Thus, although we cannot rule out that our results are an
artifact of unknown confounding or bias, the survival
improvement appears to be real.
As expected, among cases diagnosed within each period, survival decreased with increasing age at diagnosis.1
Among cases diagnosed in 2005 to 2007, median survival
decreased progressively from 18.5 months in the 20 to 44
years age group to a dismal 3.5 months in the 80þ years age
group, the only age group that did not benefit from a survival improvement in the TMZ era. Improved survival in
the youngest age group combined with static survival in the
oldest age group means that the survival disparity between
young and old GBM cases is now greater than ever.
Among cases diagnosed in 2005 to 2007 in the 20 to
44 years age group, the median survival of 18.5 months
and the 2-year survival of 39% among all cases and the
median survival of 21.5 months and the 2-year survival of
45% among those treated with both surgical resection and
radiotherapy were substantially more encouraging than
survival statistics typically quoted for GBM patients as a
whole. Because the maximum follow-up among these
cases was only 35 months, we were unable to obtain estimates of longer term survival during the 2005 to 2007 calendar period. However, even in the pre-TMZ era, we
observed 5-year survival among cases diagnosed in this age
group to be 11% to 12% among all cases and 13% to
14% among cases treated with both surgical resection and
radiotherapy, comparable to that observed in other preTMZ era patient series in this age range.37 Five-year survival among cases diagnosed in the 20 to 44 years age
group improved to 16% to 17% for all cases and to 19%
to 20% for cases treated with both resection and radiotherapy in the TMZ era calendar periods in which we
could measure 5-year survival (1999 to 2001 and 2002 to
2004). Further advances in 5-year survival since 2005 in
this age group, when the TMZ standard of care was definitively adopted, would not be surprising.

Reasons for the grim population-based survival
among the elderly, which has been documented previously,1,3,15,38 are not totally clear. Because patients over
age 70 years were not included in the landmark clinical
trial,13 the TMZ standard of care has not been established
for this age group. The extent to which the lack of
improvement in survival in the 80þ years age group was
due to resistance to TMZ therapy versus patients not
receiving or not tolerating TMZ therapy is a question for
future research.
In conclusion, the progressive, widespread adoption
of TMZ for adult GBM treatment that began in 1999 in
the United States was paralleled by a modest, but meaningful, population-based survival improvement among all
GBM patients except those aged 80þ years. Although the
increased usage of TMZ represents the most likely explanation for the survival improvement, it is possible that
other treatment advances, such as increased extent of surgical resection, also played a role. Nevertheless, there
remains an urgent need to develop novel efficacious treatments to build on the platform provided by the current
standard of care.
