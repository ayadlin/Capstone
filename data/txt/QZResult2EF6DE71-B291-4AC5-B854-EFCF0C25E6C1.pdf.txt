ABSTRACT
Nitroxoline is an antibiotic by chelating Zn2+ and Fe2+ from biofilm matrix. In this
study, nitroxoline induced G1 arrest of cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis in prostate
cancer cells through ion chelating-independent pathway. It decreased protein levels
of cyclin D1, Cdc25A and phosphorylated Rb, but activated AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor and signal transducer, leading to inhibition
of downstream mTOR-p70S6K signaling. Knockdown of AMPKα significantly rescued
nitroxoline-induced inhibition of cyclin D1-Rb-Cdc25A axis indicating AMPK-dependent
mechanism. However, cytoprotective autophagy was simultaneously evoked by
nitroxoline. Comet assay and Western blot analysis demonstrated DNA damaging
effect and activation of Chk2 other than Chk1 to nitroxoline action. Instead of serving
as a DNA repair transducer, nitroxoline-mediated Chk2 activation was identified to
function as a pro-apoptotic inducer. In conclusion, the data suggest that nitroxoline
induces anticancer activity through AMPK-dependent inhibition of mTOR-p70S6K
signaling pathway and cyclin D1-Rb-Cdc25A axis, leading to G1 arrest of cell cycle
and apoptosis. AMPK-dependent activation of Chk2, at least partly, contributes
to apoptosis. The data suggest the potential role of nitroxoline for therapeutic
development against prostate cancers.

E2F-1, BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene 1) and p53,
which have been highly associated with regulating DNA
damage response and repair, cell cycle arrest as well as
apoptosis [3–5]. During DNA damage response, Chk2
phosphorylates downstream substrates (e.g., BRCA1),
leading to initiation of homologous recombination
DNA repair signaling which may crossly interact nonhomologous end joining repair pathway [6, 7]. When
DNA damage cannot be repaired, damaged cells are
able to introduce Chk2 kinase-mediated p53-dependent
apoptotic programs [8]. Notably, Chk2 may also induce
p53-independent apoptosis through phosphorylation at
a Chk2 consensus phosphorylation site in E2F1, leading
to protein stabilization, transcriptional activation and
localization of phosphorylated E2F1 to discrete nuclear
structures and induce apoptosis [9]. Based on the critical

INTRODUCTION
Development of new chemical entities is costly
and time-consuming. Drug repurposing (also known
as drug repositioning), which refers to the discovery of
new indications from existing drugs, has been a popular
approach in recent years. After successful use of several
non-anticancer drugs for cancer therapy, drug repurposing
has attracted particular attention in both pre-clinical and
clinical studies [1, 2].
Chk2 is a tumor susceptibility gene encoding for
a serine/threonine protein kinase responsive to cellular
DNA damage [3, 4]. Activated Chk2 protein kinase serves
as a signal transducer, phosphorylating a wide variety
of substrates including cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25)
family members, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML),

role during DNA damage response and cell apoptosis,
Chk2 has been suggested as a potential target for
anticancer therapy.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), existing
as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic α
subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits, acts as a metabolic
master switch in regulating various intracellular processes
including uptake of glucose, oxidation of fatty acids
and biogenesis of mitochondria and glucose transporter
4 [10, 11]. Cellular stresses which result in depletion of
cellular ATP and an increase in AMP:ATP ratio make
AMPK a more susceptible substrate for phosphorylation
in the activation loop of α subunit by the upstream AMPK
kinase, LKB1. AMPK can also be phosphorylated and
activated by calcium/calmodulin protein kinase kinase
(CAMKK) 2 through changes in intracellular calcium
levels [11–14]. Several lines of evidence reveal that
AMPK and downstream mTOR pathways are potential
therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer [11, 13–15].
Nitroxoline, which functions by chelating Zn2+ and
2+
Fe from biofilm matrix, is an antibiotic with effective
activity at combating biofilm infections [16]. Nitroxoline
has been suggested to induce intracellular oxidant stress
[17]. Shim and the colleagues have performed a high
throughput screening test for discovering the inhibitors
of type 2 methionine amino peptidases (MetAP2) and
have found that nitroxoline inhibited MetAP2 activity
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, leading to
inhibition of endothelial tube formation and proliferation
[18]. Furthermore, nitroxoline caused a reduction in tumor
volume in breast cancer xenografts and in bladder cancer
in an orthotopic mouse model [19]. Nitroxoline derivatives
have been suggested to inhibit cathepsin B activity and
to abrogate the invasion of Ras-transformed MCF-10A
neoT cells [19]. However, the anticancer activity and
mechanism of nitroxoline against human prostate cancer
are yet to be identified. In this study, the role of AMPK/
mTOR signaling pathway and the interplay with Chk2 in
apoptosis have been identified in nitroxoline-mediated
anticancer effect in both hormone-sensitive and hormonerefractory prostate cancer cells.

Nitroxoline induces anti-proliferative effect in
human prostate cancer cells
The anti-proliferative effects of nitroxoline in both
hormone-sensitive (LNCaP) and hormone-refractory
prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and DU-145) were determined
using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Nitroxoline
induced time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation
in these cell lines (Table 1). Flow cytometric analysis of
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining
was applied to further confirm anti-proliferative activity.
The data demonstrated that nitroxoline prevented the
decrease of fluorescence intensity in PC-3 cells, indicating
the inhibition of cell proliferation (Figure 1A). Similar
effect was obtained in both DU-145 and LNCaP cells
(fluorescence intensity at 72 h of control vs. nitroxoline:
144 ± 4 vs. 326 ± 9, P < 0.001 in DU145; 258 ± 24 vs.
498 ± 15, P < 0.001 in LNCaP). The long-term effect of
nitroxoline was examined using colonogenic assay. After
a 10-day exposure, nitroxoline resulted in a profound
inhibition of colony formation with an IC50 of 3.2 ±
0.6 μM (Figure 1B).

Inhibition of cyclin D1-Rb-Cdc25A axis
contributes to nitroxoline-induced G1 arrest
Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide (PI)
staining in PC-3 cells revealed that nitroxoline induced
G1 arrest of the cell cycle (Figure 2A and 2B) followed
by a significant increase of apoptosis after a 48-hour
treatment (25.3 ± 0.6% compared with control of 4.7
± 1.1%, n = 3, P < 0.001). Cell cycle progression is
controlled by periodic activation of several Cdk/cyclin
complexes. Cyclin D1 and its catalytic partner Cdk4
are key players in G1 phase progression. Nitroxoline
induced a time-related decrease of protein expression of
cyclin D1 other than cyclin E, A and B1 in PC-3 cells
(Figure 2C). Rb protein, a tumor suppressor responsible
for G1 checkpoint, blocks the entry of S phase and cell

cycle progression. Cyclin D1/Cdk4 complex inhibits Rb
by partial phosphorylation, decreasing its association
with E2F transcription factor and allowing E2F-regulated
activation of downstream gene transcription [20, 21]. As a
result, nitroxoline decreased cyclin D1 protein expression,
leading to the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation
(Figure 2C). Furthermore, nitroxoline decreased Cdc25A
protein expression (Figure 2C). Cdc25A, a member of
Cdc25 family of dual-specificity phosphatases, is required
for S phase entry and is induced in G1 phase by E2F [22,
23]. These data suggest that nitroxoline induces G1 arrest

Nitroxoline regulates AMPK-mTOR pathway

transducer, is induced by a wide variety of metabolic
stresses. mTOR, a downstream effector of AMPK,

via regulating various cellular processes including
transcription and translation [25]. Nitroxoline induced both
concentration-dependent (Figure 3A) and time-dependent
(Figure 3B) increases of AMPKα phosphorylation at
Thr172 and decreases of mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 in PC-3 cells. Nitroxoline also inhibited p70S6K
phosphorylation at Thr389, a downstream substrate
of mTOR (Figure 3A and 3B). The data indicate that
nitroxoline induces the activation of AMPK but inhibition
of mTOR signaling pathway in PC-3 cells. Similar effects
were obtained in LNCaP cells (Supplementary Figure 1).
Autophagy is a catabolic process involving
lysosomal degradation of dysfunctional or unnecessary
cellular components. Autophagy is promoted by AMPK
but inhibited by mTOR [26, 27]. Detection of LC3 is a
reliable method for monitoring autophagy since lysosomal
turnover of LC3-II reflects autophagic activity. Moreover,
the level of p62 which is a ubiquitin- and LC3-binding
protein is increased when autophagy is impaired [28]. As a
result, nitroxoline induced a dramatic increase of LC3-II
protein level but a decrease of p62 expression (Figure 3A
and 3B), indicating an increase of autophagic activity.
Increasing lines of evidence suggest that autophagy can
serve as a survival pathway after cellular stresses by
chemotherapy or radiation [27]. Chloroquine, an inhibitor
of autophagy, was used to examine whether nitroxolineinduced autophagy represented a mechanism for cancer
cells to survive or to promote programmed cell death. The
data demonstrated that chloroquine, by itself, did not affect
cell viability but significantly potentiated nitroxolineinduced cell apoptosis (Figure 3C and supplementary
Figure 2), indicating a pro-survival role of autophagy.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPKα was
used to determine its functional regulation. AMPKα
knockdown significantly inhibited nitroxoline-induced
effects, including down-regulation of cyclin D1, inhibition
of p70S6K phosphorylation, increase of LC3-II turnover
and cleavage of PARP-1 (Figure 4). The data suggest that
AMPK activation plays an upstream role to control cell
cycle regulators and autophagic activity.

nitroxoline resulted in a significant increase of DNA
damage using comet assay (Figure 5A). The data suggest
DNA damage-dependent function of Chk2. Activated Chk2
kinase may serve as a signal transducer in promoting cell
survival or death. It phosphorylates numerous substrates
including p53, E2F, Cdc25 phosphatases and BRCA1
which are related to halting cell cycle progression,
introducing DNA repair, and inducing apoptosis
following DNA damage response [30]. The application
of both pharmacological Chk2 inhibitor and siRNA to
knockdown Chk2 did not prevent nitroxoline-induced
cyclin D1 down-regulation, p70S6K inhibition and Cdc25A
down-regulation, but significantly blunted the cleavage of
PARP-1 (Figure 5B and 5C), supporting a pro-apoptotic
role of Chk2. The data were confirmed using SRB assay.
H2AX, a variant of the H2A protein family, is
phosphorylated by Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)and Rad3-related protein (ATR) when DNA damage
forms double-strand breaks. The newly phosphorylated
H2AX, γ-H2AX, is the initial step in recruiting DNA
repair proteins [29, 31, 32]. Both immunofluorescence
microscopic examination and flow cytometric analysis
showed that nitroxoline did not induce γ-H2AX formation
but increased Chk2 phosphorylation. In contrast,
camptothecin and etoposide which were DNA damage
inducers through inhibition of topoisomerase I and II,
respectively, caused increased levels of γ-H2AX and Chk2
phosphorylation (Figure 6A and 6B). The data suggest the
absence of γ-H2AX-related DNA repair mechanism to
nitroxoline action.

ZnCl2 supplement does not rescue nitroxolinemediated anti-proliferative effect and cellular
signaling
Nitroxoline is an antibiotic functioning by chelating
Fe2+ and Zn2+. Zn2+ serves as structural ions in transcription
factors and is a cofactor in more than 300 enzymes
affecting a wide variety of cellular functions [33]. The
re-introduction of Zn2+ was applied to determine whether
the ions chelating effect contributed to nitroxoline-induced
anticancer activity. As a result, ZnCl2 supplement did not
significantly prevent Chk2 activation, cyclin D1 downregulation, AMPK activation, p70S6K inhibition and
PARP-1 cleavage (Figure 7). SRB assay also showed that
ZnCl2 supplement did not modify nitroxoline-induced
anti-proliferative effect (IC50 of 6.1 ± 0.6 μM vs. 5.5 ±
0.1 μM of nitroxoline alone, n = 4, P > 0.05).

Nitroxoline induces DNA damage and
activates Chk2
Chk2 and Chk1 pathways that are activated by
DNA double-strand breaks and single-stranded DNA,
respectively, coordinate cellular responses to DNA
damage [29]. Nitroxoline induced the phosphorylation
and activation of Chk2 other than Chk1 in both LNCaP
(Supplementary Figure 1) and PC-3 cells (Figure 3A and
3B), which were AMPK-dependent since the effect was
significantly reduced by AMPKα knockdown (Figure 4).
Recent work has revealed DNA damage-independent
function of Chk2 involving in mitotic spindle assembly
and chromosomal stability [30]. The data showed that

hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory prostate
cancers through induction of G1 arrest of the cell cycle.
Cyclin D1 is a specific G1 phase protein forming a
complex with and serving as a regulatory subunit of Cdk4
or Cdk6. Overexpression of cyclin D1 has been detected in
numerous types of cancers, including cancers of the breast,
lung and prostate [34–36] and has been considered as an
oncogenic mechanism in hormone-refractory metastatic
prostate cancer to the bone [36]. Rb is a critical tumor
suppressor for G1 checkpoint, inhibiting the entry of cell
cycle into S phase. Cyclin D1/Cdk4 complex can partially
and appropriately phosphorylate Rb protein, leading to its
dissociation from E2F1 transcription factor and allowing
the activation of gene transcription [20, 21]. Many cancers
have been shown to exhibit chromosomal abnormalities
which directly result in the functional inactivation of Rb
and promote cell proliferation [37]. In the present work,
nitroxoline induced a dramatic down-regulation of cyclin
D1 expression and inhibition of Rb phosphorylation that
explained the G1 arrest of cell cycle and indicated the
potential against prostate cancers.
mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a crucial
role in cell proliferation, growth, survival and metabolism
through the regulation of multiple interacting proteins.
mTORC1 is a major rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex,
promoting protein synthesis in response to growth factors
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

through the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1
[25, 38]. p70S6K activation involves the phosphorylation
of several serine and threonine sites; the critical event
is Thr389 phosphorylation. Both phosphoinositide
3-dependent protein kinase 1 and mTOR are potent
Thr389 kinases [39, 40]. Pharmacogenomic profiling of
mTOR-p70S6K pathway shows that the protein synthetic
machinery is overexpressed and activated during tumor
progression [41]. Immunohistochemistry analysis also
reveals a strong association between mTOR-p70S6K
activation and prostate cancer progression [42, 43].
During G1 phase, cells grow in size and synthesize
mRNA and proteins required for DNA synthesis at
S phase. Nitroxoline displayed profound inhibition of
mTOR-p70S6K pathway supporting G1 arrest activity.
AMPK, a cellular energy sensor and signal transducer,
is a key player to switch off mTOR pathway through
phosphorylating and thereby activating tuberous sclerosis
protein (TSC) 2, leading to association of TSC1/TSC2
complex and inhibition of mTOR pathway. AMPK is a
potential target of drugs for regulating numerous human
diseases ranging from metabolic disorders to cancers
[25, 44]. AMPK knockdown significantly prevented the
inhibition of mTOR-p70S6K pathway and rescued the
cyclin D1 expression, indicating the central role of AMPK
in nitroxoline-mediated effect.

Nitroxoline also induced autophagy through an
AMPK-dependent pathway. Recent studies suggest
that Atg1/UNC-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1
(Ulk 1) complex is an essential player in autophagy
initiation [45]. Ulk1, a homologue of yeast Atg1, is
activated by AMPK via direct phosphorylation of Ser317
and Ser777. In contrast, mTOR phosphorylates Ulk1 at
Ser757 and interrupts the interaction between AMPK and
Ulk1 [46]. Coordination between AMPK and mTOR is
critical for Ulk1 in autophagy induction and may explain
nitroxoline-induced activation of AMPK and autophagy.
However, the increased autophagy decreased apoptosis to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

nitroxoline action. The cytoprotective autophagy has been
studied under cellular stresses, such as hypoxia, nutrient
deprivation, oxidative stress and cytotoxic drug exposure.
Therefore, autophagy advances survival and growth of
cancer cells and resistance to chemotherapy [27, 47].
Targeting autophagy in cancer will provide novel strategy
for drug development [47, 48].
Chk2 encodes for a serine/threonine kinase which
coordinates cellular responses to DNA damage [29]. It
phosphorylates diverse substrates, including p53, E2F
and Cdc25 phosphatases, associated with the arrest of
cell cycle and introduction of DNA repair [3, 30]. More

specifically, Chk2 is able to phosphorylate and downregulate Cdc25A, resulting in G1 arrest of the cell cycle
[49]. However, the data showed that Chk2 activation
contributed to nitroxoline-induced cleavage of PARP-1
(a caspase-3 substrate) other than the regulation of cyclin
D1, Cdc25A and p70S6K. The data indicate that Chk2
serves as a pro-apoptotic activator but not a coordinator
in cell cycle arrest. Recent work suggests that γ-H2AX
plays a key role in the enrollment and maintenance of
DNA repair and checkpoint proteins [29, 31, 32]. It has
been reported that H2AX-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts
are susceptible to radiation, showing deficits in repairing
DNA damage compared to the wild-type counterparts
[32]. The present study showed that nitroxoline, at
effective concentrations in displaying anti-proliferative
and apoptotic activities, did not induce γ-H2AX formation
and suggested the absence of γ-H2AX-related DNA repair
mechanism. However, higher concentrations of nitroxoline
could induce γ-H2AX formation (data not shown) and,
therefore, the related DNA repair mechanism might be
activated. Notably, the activation of Chk2 was AMPKdependent in prostate cancers upon nitroxoline exposure.
Recent work with AMPKα knockout mouse embryonic
fibroblasts has demonstrated a reduced phosphorylation
and activity of Chk2 kinase in response to ionizing
radiation [50]. Moreover, AMPK has been suggested
to function in a point of convergence of metabolic and
genomic stress signals, regulating downstream signaling
upon growth factor stimulation and propagating DNA

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

damage response through ATM/Chk2 pathway [51]. These
studies support an upstream role of AMPK in regulating
Chk2 activity. However, defect in DNA repair mechanism
during nitroxoline treatment shifted the pro-survival
nature of Chk2 into pro-apoptotic disposition. Similar
pro-apoptotic function of Chk2 also has been suggested.
Small molecules like Nutlin-3 and RITA (reactivation
of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis) have been
reported to induce apoptosis in human uveal melanoma
cells and colorectal carcinomas through p53-dependent
Chk2 activation [52]. In contrast, Chk2 expression in
p53-mutated cancer cells, in spite of the absence of DNA
damaging stimuli, is sufficient to induce apoptosis [53].
These studies suggest that direct activation of Chk2 can
be explored as a novel anticancer approach.
Taken together, the data suggest nitroxoline induces
anti-proliferative and apoptotic signaling cascades
against prostate cancer in a sequential manner (Figure 8).
Nitroxoline induces the activation of AMPK, which
in turn inhibits mTOR signaling pathway and cyclin
D1-Rb-Cdc25A axis, leading to G1 arrest of cell cycle
and apoptosis. Nitroxoline also induces AMPK-dependent
activation of Chk2 that, at least partly, contributes to cell
apoptosis. However, the activated autophagy may blunt
apoptosis. The data suggest the potential of nitroxoline
for therapeutic development against prostate cancer.
Inhibitors of autophagy may potentiate apoptotic cell
death and provide novel strategy for the development of
nitroxoline.

absorbance was read at a wavelength of 515 nm. Using
the following absorbance measurements, such as time zero
(T0), control growth (C), and cell growth in the presence
of the agent (Tx), the percentage growth was calculated
at each of the agent concentrations levels. Percentage
growth inhibition was calculated as: [1- (Tx-T0)/(C-T0)] x
100%. Growth inhibition of 50% (IC50) is determined at
the agent concentration which results in 50% reduction
of total protein increase in control cells during the agent
incubation.

Cell lines and cell culture
PC-3, DU-145 (hormone-refractory) and LNCaP
(hormone-sensitive) prostate cancer cell lines were from
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS (v/v),

10  minutes, RPMI medium with 10% FBS was added.
Tubes were placed in ice for 5 minutes and then washed.
After centrifugation, the cells were seeded in RPMI
medium with 10% FBS for 24, 48 and 72 hours at 37°C
under 5% CO2/95% air. After treatment, the fluorescence
intensity was determined by flow cytometric analysis
(Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

(dilute 1:2000) was applied to the membranes for 1 hour
at room temperature. The membranes were washed with
PBS/0.1% Tween 20 for 1 hour and the detection of signal
was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, NJ, USA).

Colony formation assay

Cells were seeded into 60-mm tissue culture dishes
with 30% confluence and grown for 24 hours to 50%
confluence. Each dish was washed with serum-free OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Ground Island, NY), and 2 ml
of same medium was added. Aliquots containing siRNA
in serum-free Opti-MEM were transfected into cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 according to the instructions. After
incubation for 24 to 48 hours, cells were washed with
medium and incubated in 10% FBS-containing RPMI1640 medium for 24 hours. The cells were treated with
or without nitroxoline and the protein expression was
detected using Western bot analysis.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection

To assess anchorage-dependent colony formation
effect, the cells (100 cells/well) were seeded in a 6-well
plate. After a 10-day treatment with nitroxoline, the cell
colonies were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), stained with 0.25% crystal violet/20% ethanol and
photographed by a camera with Copy Stan (Nikon Model
No. CS-920; Shimadzu, Japan).

Flow cytometric analysis of PI staining
Cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed with
70% (v/v) alcohol at 4°C for 30 minutes and washed with
PBS. After centrifugation, cells were incubated in 0.1 M
phosphate-citric acid buffer (0.2 M NaHPO4, 0.1 M citric
acid, pH7.8) for 30 minutes. Cells were centrifuged and
resuspended with 0.5 ml PI solution containing Triton
X-100 (0.1% v/v), RNase (100 μg/ml) and PI (80 μg/ml).
DNA content was analyzed with FACScan and CellQuest
software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

Comet assay

The DNA fragmentation was determined using the
Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany). The assay was based on the quantitative in vitro
determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA
fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) after induced
cell death. After the treatment, the cells were lysed and
centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for the detection
of nucleosomal DNA according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

After treatment, the cells were pelleted and
resuspended in ice-cold PBS. The resuspended cells were
mixed with 1.5% low melting point agarose. This mixture
was loaded onto a fully frosted slide that had been precoated with 0.7% agarose and a coverslip was then applied
to the slide. The slides were submerged in pre-chilled
lysis solution (1% Triton X-100, 2.5 M NaCl, and 10 mM
EDTA, pH 10.5) for 1 hour at 4°C. After soaking with
pre-chilled unwinding and electrophoresis buffer (0.3 N
NaOH and 1 mM EDTA) for 20 minutes, the slides were
subjected to electrophoresis for 15 minutes at 0.5 V/cm
(20 mA). After electrophoresis, slides were stained with
1X Sybr Gold (Molecular Probes) and nuclei images were
visualized and captured at 400X magnifications with an
Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany)
equipped with a CCD camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA).
Over hundreds of cells were scored to calculate the overall
percentage of comet tail-positive cells.

Western blotting

Immunofluorescence microscopic examination

After treatment, the cells were washed twice with
ice-cold PBS and reaction was terminated by the addition
of 100 μl ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml
aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100). For
western blot analysis, the amount of proteins (40 μg) were
separated by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide
gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After
an overnight incubation at 4°C in PBS/5% nonfat milk,
the membrane was washed with PBS/0.1% Tween 20 for
1 hour and immuno-reacted with the indicated antibody
for 2 hours at room temperature. After four washings with
PBS/0.1% Tween 20, the anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG

After treatment, the cells were fixed with 100%
methanol at −20°C for 20 minutes and incubated in 1%
bovine serum albumin containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at
37°C for 30 minutes. For double staining, cells were first
processed the single staining procedure. The cells were
washed twice with PBS for 5 minutes and stained with
the p-chk2 antibody at room temperature for 1 hour and
then, the Cyt3-conjugated secondary antibody at room
temperature for 1 hour. After washed with PBS, this
process was repeated for staining γ-H2AX with FITCconjugated secondary antibody. Nuclear staining was
performed by 1 μg/ml DAPI. The cells were analyzed by
an Axio Imager A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss).
