Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Common copy number variations (CNVs) represent a significant source of genetic diversity, yet their
influence on phenotypic variability, including disease susceptibility, remains poorly understood. To
address this problem in cancer, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CNVs
in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, a disease where SNP variations are known to influence
susceptibility1,2. We first genotyped 846 Caucasian neuroblastoma patients and 803 healthy

Caucasian controls at 550,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and performed a CNV-based test
for association. We then replicated significant observations in two independent sample sets
comprised of a total of 595 cases and 3,357 controls. We identified a common CNV at 1q21.1
associated with neuroblastoma in the discovery set, which was confirmed in both replication sets
(Pcombined = 2.97 × 10−17; OR = 2.49, 95% CI: 2.02 to 3.05). This CNV was validated by quantitative
PCR, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and analysis of matched tumor specimens, and was shown to
be heritable in an independent set of 713 cancer-free trios. We identified a novel transcript within
the CNV which showed high sequence similarity to several “Neuroblastoma breakpoint
family” (NBPF) genes3,4 and represents a new member of this gene family (NBPFX). This transcript
was preferentially expressed in fetal brain and fetal sympathetic nervous tissues, and expression level
was strictly correlated with CNV state in neuroblastoma cells. These data demonstrate that inherited
copy number variation at 1q21.1 is associated with neuroblastoma and implicate a novel NBPF gene
in early tumorigenesis of this childhood cancer.

Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer of the developing sympathetic nervous system that most
commonly affects young children, and is often lethal5. Most neuroblastomas arise sporadically,
with less than 1% of cases inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion5. We recently identified
the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene as the major hereditary neuroblastoma
predisposition gene1. For the vast majority of neuroblastomas that arise without a family history
of the disease, we hypothesize that multiple common DNA variations cooperate to increase
the risk for neuroblastic malignant transformation. By performing a genome-wide association
study (GWAS) of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes, we recently identified
common SNP alleles within the putative FLJ22536 and FLJ44180 genes at 6p22 and within
the BARD1 gene at 2q35 associated with malignant neuroblastoma, providing the first evidence
that childhood cancers also arise due to complex interactions of polymorphic variants1,2. Here,
we investigate constitutional DNA copy number variations (CNVs) as another source of genetic
diversity that may contribute to the development of this disease. CNVs have been shown to
significantly influence mRNA expression levels6 and recent studies have described
associations of CNVs with systemic autoimmunity7,8, autism9, schizophrenia10,11,12, and
psoriasis13. In addition, Shlien and colleagues reported an increased number of CNVs in LiFraumeni families harboring TP53 mutations, but did not explore associations of individual
CNVs with cancer susceptibility14.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify CNVs that are associated with neuroblastoma, we first genotyped a discovery set
of 1,032 Caucasian neuroblastoma patients and 2,043 disease-free Caucasian control subjects,
as previously described1,15. We next applied stringent quality control criteria necessary for
accurate CNV detection and reliable association assessment (see Supplementary Methods).
The final discovery set consisted of 846 Caucasian cases and 803 Caucasian controls
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). These subjects showed tight clustering in a multi-dimensional
scaling (MDS) analysis of SNPs not in linkage disequilibrium (LD; Supplementary Figure 1),
demonstrating that population substructure was not likely to have a significant impact on
association testing.
By comparing single marker binary copy number states at 531,689 SNPs mapped to autosomes,
we observed a total of 131 SNPs showing significant association with neuroblastoma, defined
as a two-sided Fisher’s exact test p-value below a genome-wide threshold of P = 1.0 × 10−7
(Supplementary Table 3). Associations with deletion polymorphisms were seen at
chromosomes 1, 7, and 14 (Figure 1a); no duplication polymorphisms reached genome-wide
significance (Figure 1b). Review of significant SNPs revealed four distinct regions of deletion
(Table 1). We next sought to validate significant association signals in two independent
replication sets, the first consisting of 363 Caucasian cases and 1,139 Caucasian controls, the
second of 232 Caucasian cases and 2,218 Caucasian controls (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

All deletion associations showed robust replication in both independent case-series (Table 2
and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We observed a seven-SNP deletion at 1q21.1 which occurred in 15.6% of cases but only 9.1%
of controls overall (Pcombined = 2.97 × 10−17; OR = 2.49, 95% CI: 2.02 to 3.05). This association
remained significant after additional adjustment for potential population substructure captured
by SNPs not in LD (Pdiscovery < 0.0001), and was driven by a difference in hemizygous deletion
frequency (Pcombined = 1.83 × 10−19). The observed frequency of homozygous deletion was
identical in cases and controls (1.3% overall). The maximal deletion defined by neighboring
2-copy SNPs spanned 1.6 Mb and contained a cluster of “Neuroblastoma Breakpoint
Family” (NBPF) genes (Figure 1c). To refine the maximal deletion boundaries, we first
genotyped 48 representative samples on the Illumina CNV-12 array (36 cases and 12 controls
equally divided between those with and without the deletion CNV). These data reduced the
maximal size of the deletion to approximately 300-Kb, consistent with published reports of
CNVs at this location (Figure 1c)16,17,18. Lastly, use of the Illumina HumanHap610 SNP
platform reduced the maximal deletion size to only 143-Kb, from 147,292,384 – 147,435,422
(Supplementary Figure 2). The minimal deletion based on significant SNPs in the association
study spanned 121-Kb from 147,305,744–147,427,061and did not contain any known genes
(Figure 1d).

We next sought to confirm that this CNV is indeed a heritable genetic variation. First, we
genotyped an independent set of 713 trios from variable phenotypes on the same 550K SNP
array and generated CNV calls using a family-based approach16. Deletion at 1q21.1 was
observed in 125 offspring and confirmed by parental analysis in 123 trios, estimating the
inheritance rate at 98.4%. Next, we genotyped paired tumor DNA in 226 cases (Supplementary
Table 2) using the same 550K SNP platform, and confirmed existence of the CNV (deletion
and duplication) in every tumor sample studied (Supplementary Figure 3a). We did not observe
progression from hemizygous deletion in constitutional DNA to homozygous deletion in the
matched tumor DNA for any case in this study, nor did we observe any expansion of CNV
boundaries in tumor compared to matched constitutional DNA.
To investigate whether 1q21.1 deletions are associated with specific neuroblastoma
phenotypes, we tested each for association with clinical covariates using the combined set of
1,441 cases (Supplementary Table 6). While deletions at 1q21.1 were observed more frequently
in patients with aggressive disease; this trend did not reach statistical significance in this study.
An additive effect on the odds ratio was observed for those harboring both the 1q21.1 deletion
and the 6p22 risk alleles (Supplementary Figure 4), but no significant interaction effect was
detected to suggest epistasis (Supplementary Table 7).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to the 1q21.1 CNV, we observed highly significant associations of deletion within
all four T-cell receptor (TCR) loci clustered on chromosomes 7 and 14. Contrary to the 1q21.1
CNV, TCR deletions were not observed in paired tumor DNA samples (Supplementary Figure
3b). Heterogeneity was observed in the areas of apparent deletion consistent with some cells
harboring homozygous deletion, and others exhibiting 2-copy heterozygosity. Deletions within
the T-cell receptors tended to co-occur in patients (P < 0.0001, Supplementary Table 7), and
were significantly more common in blood-than bone marrow-derived DNA samples (PTCRG
= 9.2 × 10−31, PTCRVB = 7.3 × 10−6, PTCRA/D = 8.0 × 10−50). Taken together, these findings
suggest that we are detecting an oligoclonal expansion of T-cell lymphocytes in a subset of
neuroblastoma patients, and this signal is diluted within the bone marrow compartment.
Interestingly, TCR deletions showed a striking over-representation in the less aggressive subset
of neuroblastoma (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figure 5). It is possible that these
events herald an immunologic response to neuroblastoma, however this hypothesis requires
further investigation.

To validate the 1q21.1 CNV, we first performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) on 46 neuroblastoma
cases (ten 0-copy, sixteen 1-copy, twelve 2-copy, and eight duplications as predicted by SNP
analysis). We observed 100% concordant results when comparing copy number estimated by
qPCR with copy number based on SNP genotyping (Figure 2a). To confirm that the detected
CNV is not an artifact caused by segmental duplication of the 1p36 region, and that it indeed
maps to 1q21.1, we validated the existence of the deletion in a sample harboring a single copy
loss using fluorescent in situ hybridization (Figure 2b).
Although no known genes mapped to the refined 1q21.1 CNV, we identified a spliced EST
(BQ431323) from a melanoma library that mapped within the CNV with 100% identity across
the entire sequence (Figure 1d). Using primers designed against exon-1 and exon-3 of
BQ431323, we PCR amplified cDNA from fetal brain and a neuroblastoma cell line. These
PCR products were cloned and sequenced; the resulting sequence mapped uniquely within the
CNV with 100% identity across the entire sequence and showed splicing out of the predicted
second exon of BQ431323 (Supplementary Figure 6). The top scoring hit from a Blastn19
search of this sequence against available human RefSeq transcripts was NBPF3 (E = 5.0 ×
10−89), followed by NBPF1 (E = 1.0 × 10−75) and NBPF15 (E = 2.0 × 10−24). These data
provide strong evidence for a novel NBPF transcript, termed “NBPFX” here, mapping within
the 1q21.1 CNV associated with neuroblastoma.

We investigated the expression of NBPFX in both neuroblastoma cells and normal human fetal
and adult tissues using realtime quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Analysis of eighteen
neuroblastomas (tumors and cell lines) of known copy number at the 1q21.1 CNV showed a
clear correlation between CNV state and transcript expression (Figure 2c). Notably, 2-copy
samples clustered into two distinct expression classes (P = 0.007), the first with low expression
and the second with high expression, and these likely represent different 1q21.1 CNV
genotypes. There are two possible CNV genotypes for 2-copy samples, which we refer to as
2:0 (“cis”) and 1:1 (“trans”) based on the number of copies present on each chromosome in a
diploid genome (Supplementary Figure 7a). Two neuroblastoma samples in the low-expression
group can be demonstrated to be from the 2:0 constitutional CNV genotype because they have
somatically acquired gain of chromosome 1q (3-copies) yet are 2-copies with heterozygous
SNPs at the 1q21.1 CNV (see Supplementary Figure 7b–c for details). These findings are
consistent with the hypothesis that two copies in “cis” (same chromosome) behave differently
than two copies in “trans” (different chromosomes). Therefore, we propose a model whereby
NBPFX expression is decreased when copies are in the “cis” configuration as opposed to the
“trans” configuration. Importantly however, even when the 2-copy samples are not clustered
in this manner, a statistically significant difference in transcript levels is observed between the
2- and 3-copy samples (P = 0.001). Finally, we analyzed expression of NBPFX in a panel of
twenty-eight normal fetal and adult tissues (Figure 2d). We observed the highest transcript
levels in fetal brain and fetal sympathetic ganglia from early gestation (13–22 wks), consistent
with NBPFX being expressed in early sympathicoadrenal neurodevelopment.
NBPF genes were identified after the founding member, NBPF1, was determined to be
disrupted via a constitutional chromosomal translocation in a neuroblastoma patient3,4.
Subsequent scans of the genome identified three clusters of NBPF genes on chromosome 1
within areas of segmental duplication. The encoded proteins are recently evolved and primatespecific, share significant homology, and contain highly conserved domains of unknown
function (DUF1220) that are thought to be neuronal-specific3,20. Constitutional deletions
disrupting NBPF genes have been implicated in schizophrenia10,11,12 and autism10, and rare
recurrent structural variants just upstream of the CNV identified in this study have also been
reported in a variety of phenotypes including mental retardation, autism, and congenital
anomalies21. Although the specific functions of NBPF genes are not known, recently evolved
genes may be involved in cancer predisposition due to a lack of selective pressure12. Expression

of NBPF1 was recently shown to suppress anchorage independent growth4. Conversely, overexpression of NBPF transcripts has been reported in several cancers including sarcomas22 and
non-small-cell lung cancer23. A challenge for the field is to design experiments that clearly
distinguish these highly homologous transcripts and define specific disease-causal
mechanisms.
Neuroblastoma likely develops from the malignant transformation of partially committed
sympathicoadrenal neuroblasts during fetal or early childhood development. We previously
identified the ALK gene as the major familial neuroblastoma predisposition gene1 and showed
that common variations at 6p22 and 2q35 are associated with sporadic neuroblastma1,2. In our
current study, we show that a common CNV at 1q21.1 likewise contributes to neuroblastoma
susceptibility, and that this CNV leads to altered expression of a novel NBPFX transcript.
These data provide the first definitive evidence for a specific CNV predisposing to human
cancer, and ongoing efforts will define remaining susceptibility variants in the human genome
associated with neuroblastoma.

METHODS SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A multi-phase GWAS of CNVs in neuroblastoma was performed. A discovery set of 846
Caucasian neuroblastoma patients and 803 Caucasian healthy controls were genotyped using
a 550K SNP array and CNV profiles were generated24,16, providing a copy number state for
each SNP on the array. Association with neuroblastoma was assessed at 531,689 individual
SNPs on autosomes using Fisher’s exact test on the binary comparison of “deletion vs. no
deletion” or “duplication vs. no duplication”. A genome-wide significance threshold was set
at P = 1.0 × 10−7 and replication of significant findings was assessed using two independent
replication sets, the first consisting of 363 Caucasian neuroblastoma cases and 1,139 Caucasian
controls, the second of 232 Caucasian neuroblastoma cases and 2,218 Caucasian controls.
Matched tumor DNA from 226 cases was genotyped to evaluate whether observed deletions
were constitutional or somatically acquired rearrangements in the blood. An independent set
of 713 trios with no reported incidence or history of cancer was genotyped and used to establish
heritability of significant CNVs. Inherited CNVs were validated by quantitative realtime PCR
and fluorescent in situ hybridization. Association with clinical and biological co-variates was
assessed on the combined set of 1,441 neuroblastoma cases with available annotation. PCR
amplification of cDNA from fetal brain and neuroblastoma cell lines was performed to identify
a novel 1q21.1 transcript; products from these PCR reactions were sequenced and aligned to
the human genome using BLAT25. Similarity to known NBPF transcripts was detected using
Blastn19. Expression of the novel NBPF transcript was assessed using realtime quantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR.

METHODS
Sample Selection
Cases were defined as a child diagnosed with neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma and
registered through the Children’s Oncology Group (COG). All specimens were obtained at
time of diagnosis and the majority were annotated with clinical and genomic information that
included: age at diagnosis, site of origin, disease stage by the International Neuroblastoma
Staging System26, INPC International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification27, MYCN
oncogene copy number28, DNA index (ploidy)29, registration on clinical trial(s), event-free
and overall survival, second malignancies, and any associated conditions (e.g. congenital
abnormalities). Additional eligibility criteria and quality control measures, including exclusion
of samples with evidence of circulating tumor DNA, are detailed in Supplementary Methods.

Control subjects were recruited from the Philadelphia region through the CHOP Health Care
Network, including four primary care clinics and several group practices and outpatient
practices that included well child visits. Eligibility criteria for control subjects were: 1) selfreported as Caucasian; 2) availability of 1.5 μg of high quality DNA from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells; and 3) no serious underlying medical disorder, including cancer.
Genome-wide SNP Genotyping
Genotyping for both discovery and replication phases was performed using the Illumina
Infinium™ II HumanHap550 BeadChip according to methods detailed elsewhere15,30 and
summarized in Supplementary Methods.
CNV Detection
Log R Ratio signal intensities were adjusted for “wave-like” artifacts using a regression-based
approach described by Diskin and colleagues24 and PennCNV16 was utilized to call CNVs in
each sample. Copy number at each SNP was then inferred based on projection of CNVs onto
genomic sequence.
Statistical Tests

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The single marker statistical analysis for the genome-wide data was carried out using Fisher’s
exact test on binary copy number differences (“deletion vs. no deletion” or “duplication vs. no
duplication”) between cases and controls. Two-sided p-values were reported and the Odds
Ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for genome-wide
significant copy number association results. A threshold of 1.0 × 10−7 was set for genomewide significance based on the fact that approximately 500,000 SNPs were tested
(0.05/500,000 = 1.0 × 10−7).
CNVs reaching genome-wide significance were tested for association with clinical and
biological co-variates using Fisher’s exact test. All comparisons were made based on binary
comparison of “deletion vs. no deletion” or “duplication vs. no duplication, and two-sided pvalues were reported. For deletions within the T-cell receptors, only cases from peripheral
blood (not bone marrow) were considered in the clinical correlative analyses because we
observed a significant association of T-cell receptor deletions with blood vs. bone marrow
(PTCRG = 9.2 × 10−31, PTCRVB = 7.3 × 10−6, PTCRA/D = 8.0 × 10−50).
CNV heritability

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We utilized Illumina HumanHap550 SNP genotyping data on 713 trios in order to establish
heritability of the 1q21.1 CNV. Families consisted of individuals with no reported incidence
or history of cancer; however other conditions were reported. The condition reported most
frequently was autism (>50% of probands). Data from 565 trios was generated from
lymphoblastoid cell lines and the remaining 148 were from peripheral blood. CNV profiles
were generated for each offspring and parent in the trios using a family-based method in
PennCNV to increase sensitivity of CNV detection16. The concordance frequency between
offspring and parent was computed and reported as an estimated inheritance rate for the CNV.
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Metaphase spreads were prepared either from peripheral blood lymphocytes or subject-derived,
lymphoblastoid cell lines using standard methodology. Chromosomes were visualized by
counter-staining with DAPI. BAC and Fosmid clones used for FISH analysis were obtained
from the BACPAC resources (Oakland, California, USA). FISH was performed using fosmid
W12-1967b11 (GenBank:G248P87625A6) and BAC RP4-790G17(GenBank:AL138795).
FISH analysis was carried out as described previously31. BACs and fosmids were isolated

10 ng of genomic DNA in a 10 ul reaction which contained 200 nM concentration of probe,
900 nM of each amplification primer and 1 X of Real-time PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Samples were amplified on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection
System using standard cycling conditions and data collected and analyzed with SDS 2.3
software. Standard curves were constructed using serial 2-fold dilutions of genomic DNA from
an individual without NBPF copy number variation and used to estimate amounts of DNA in
the experimental samples from their cycle threshold (Ct) values. Ratios of amounts were
calculated from the assay designed in the area of variation (NBPF_DEL) and the assay in a
region known to be present in all samples from the genome-wide association data (CTRL_2C).
This normalized amount was then compared to the value in a control calibrator sample to
produce a fold change ratio (normal =1) and multiplied by 2 to generate a copy number (normal
= 2).

RNA samples for “normal” panel
Fetal spinal ganglia were obtained at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia from perinatal
autopsies, in non-macerated fetuses ranging in gestational age from 18 weeks to 22 weeks who
had underwent intrauterine demise. Following removal of the lungs, the thoracic paraspinal
sympathetic chains were identified in-situ, and entirely removed. Gestational age was recorded,
but the specimens were otherwise anonymous. The specimens were frozen in optimum cutting
temperature compound (OCT), and stored at minus 70 degrees. Validation of the presence of
sympathetic ganglia was performed through examination of hematoxylin-eosin stained frozen
sections by a pathologist. Total RNA for all other normal adult and fetal tissues was obtained
from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) or BioChain (Hayward, CA).

Figure 1. Discovery of 1q21.1 CNV associated with neuroblastoma

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(a) Summary of discovery results for deletions. Level of significance (log10 transformed Pvalues) for each SNP at each chromosome is plotted. Red line: genome-wide significance
threshold. (b) Summary of discovery results for duplications. (c) Genomic map and refinement
of 1q21.1 deletion boundaries. SNPs from the 550K array and markers from the CNV-12 array
are plotted as dots or tick marks; those reaching genome-wide significance are colored red.
Image borders represent maximal deletion boundaries based on 550K array data, and includes
a cluster of NBPF genes and several other RefSeq transcripts. Refined maximal boundaries
using CNV-12 data (black bar) is consistent with published structural variations. (d) Genomic
map of 121-kb minimal 1q21.1 deletion covered by significant SNPs. The region contains a
high level of segmental duplication which extends to flanking regions (not shown). The
BQ431323 melanoma EST maps uniquely within this region, while several Genbank
transcripts align to the region with > 95% identity, but map elsewhere on the genome. Blat
alignment of PCR amplified and cloned sequence from fetal brain in this study is shown
(NBPFX).

Figure 2. Validation and biological relevance of 1q21.1 CNV

(a) Quantitative PCR validation of 1q21.1 CNV states shows 100% agreement with SNP
genotyping data. Box plot is shown for 0-copy (n=10), 1-copy (n=16), 2-copy (n=12), 3-copy
(n=6) and > 3 copies (n=2). (b) FISH validation of 1q21.1 deletion. Shown are metaphase
spreads from lymphoblastoid cell lines established from an individual with normal 2-copy (left)
and an individual with hemizygous deletion (right). Red arrows: BAC RP4-790G17 which
maps just outside of the deletion CNV from 148,424,830–148,557,655 (two copies in both
individuals). Green arrows: fosmid W12-1967b11 which maps within the deleted region from
147,382,742–147,420,968, encompassing the first two exons of the putative NBPF transcript
(one copy in individual with hemizygous deletion). (c) Box plot showing correlation between
CNV state and NBPFX transcript levels demonstrated using real-time quantitative PCR in
eighteen neuroblastoma samples: 1-copy (n=5), 2-copy (low, n=4), 2-copy (high, n=3), 3-copy
(n=5), and > 3 copies (n=1). 2-copy samples clustered into two distinct groups consistent with
expression difference based on whether copies are in “cis” (2:0 CNV genotype) or “trans” (1:1
CNV genotype); see text for details. (d) Expression of NBPFX in normal fetal and adult tissues
