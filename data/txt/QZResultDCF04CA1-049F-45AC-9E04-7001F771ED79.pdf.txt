Abstract:

Earlier we had shown that the MDM2 inhibitor (MI-219) belonging to the spiro-oxindole
family can synergistically enhance the efficacy of platinum chemotherapeutics
leading to 50% tumor free survival in a genetically complex pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) xenograft model. In this report, we have taken a systems
and network modeling approach in order to understand central mechanisms
behind MI219-oxaliplatin synergy with validation in PDAC, colon and breast cancer
cell lines. Microarray profiling of drug treatments (MI-219, oxaliplatin or their
combination) in capan-2 cells reveal a similar unique set of gene alterations that is
duplicated in other solid tumor cells. As single agent, MI-219 or oxaliplatin induced
alterations in 48 and 761 genes respectively. The combination treatment resulted
in 767 gene alterations with emergence of 286 synergy unique genes. Ingenuity
network modeling of combination and synergy unique genes showed the crucial
role of five key local networks CREB, CARF, EGR1, NF-kB and E-Cadherin. Compared
to single agents the combination treatment super induced p53 and p21 confirming
functional synergy. Further, the network signatures were validated at the protein
level in all three cell lines. Individually silencing central nodes in these five hubs
interfered with MI-219-oxaliplatin activity confirming their critical role in aiding
p53 mediated apoptotic response. We anticipate that our MI219-oxaliplatin network
blueprints can be clinically translated in the rationale design and application of this
unique therapeutic combination in a genetically pre-defined subset of patients.

Introduction

single molecule to entire molecular pathways or cellular
networks. Such technologies are crucial for identifying
and understanding the mechanisms of potential target
candidates in complex diseases where core de-regulatory
networks are still being identified [3].
Biological interaction networks have been available
to the scientific community for more than a decade, but
only in the last few years has the concept of network
biology found its application in the field of cancer drug
discovery. Despite its shortcomings, the initial version
of human interactome networks are now of sufficient
quality to provide clinically useful information [4,5].

Network modeling and systems biology are
important tools that are finding applications in the area
of drug discovery [1]. This technology allows realtime simulation of how biological molecules function
in coordination to achieve a particular outcome,
consequently providing tremendous power of predicting
the drug response in terms of the effect of modulating the
function of a given molecule or pathway [2]. A network
perspective of drug targets has direct implications in drug
discovery process since it changes the target entity from a

MDM2 (here MI-219, developed in collaboration with
Ascenta Therapeutics [15]) and tested them against
multiple cancers including lymphoma [16], PDAC, colon
and breast [17,18]. Our laboratory has also investigated
novel and potent combinations of such MDM2 inhibitors
with standard chemotherapy and demonstrated synergy
with platinum drug treatments (but not gemcitabine) that
resulted is tumor free survival in PDAC xenograft models
[19]. Such strong preclinical evidence has accelerated
the development of MDM2 inhibitors towards clinical
application [20].
We have found that MI-219 when combined with
oxaliplatin can induce superior growth inhibition in
wt-p53 PDAC [21]. This synergistic efficacy was not
restricted to a PDAC tumor models and could be translated
to other wt-p53 solid tumors. Although investigations
from our laboratory certainly prove the potential of these
inhibitors against wt-p53 tumors, still, our knowledge of
the mechanism of action of these inhibitors, especially
their combination synergy with platinum drugs, is
incomplete. This is because MDM2 has protein partners
both upstream and downstream but yet are independent
of p53 [22] and we are still learning the intricacies of the

Such integrated analyses may lead to the identification
of pathways and help in our understanding of single drug
mechanism of action, synergy between two drugs, or
enhance our knowledge as to how one drug modulates the
effect of another given drug. Thus far, network analysis
has facilitated the prediction of possible molecules
affected by specified perturbations of up and downstream
targets by different drugs. Such predictions can be
applied to the development of clinically relevant drug
combinations. This is important for understanding drugs
that are designed against master regulators such as p53,
known to regulate a variety of targets and is the focus of
this study.
p53 (often considered guardian of genome) [6] is
found mutated in about 50% of all cancers [7,8]. In the
remaining 50%, p53 is wild type (wt-p53), however, its
function is inhibited mainly by the cellular oncoprotein
MDM2 [9,10]. Therefore, wt-p53 reactivation by
blocking MDM2-p53 interaction using small molecule
inhibitors is considered an effective therapeutic strategy
for the treatment of wt-p53 cancer [11-14]. Over the last
decade, many groups including ours have extensively
worked on developing small molecule inhibitors of

p53-MDM2 pathway, its role in tumorigenesis and the
influence of additional regulatory networks on these two
multifaceted proteins [23,24]. Recently, we have proposed
that decoding the complexity of targets associated to both
p53 and MDM2 requires a network centric approach
considering global interacting proteins partners without
loosing key details [21, 25]. Such holistic approach
will help in better understanding of MDM2 inhibitor
mechanism of action either alone or in combination with
various chemotherapeutic drugs.
In this paper, we utilized a systems biology and
network modeling approach to delineated the underlying
mechanisms governing the synergy between MI-219oxaliplatin in PDAC cell line. We proposed and provided
data to demonstrate that our synergy networks signatures
could be utilized for rationally designing clinical trials of
MI-219-oxaliplatin in a genetically pre-defined subset of
patients with not only PDAC, but also in patients with
other types of cancer, providing an understanding for a
more optimal outcome.

MI-219 and oxaliplatin is a highly potent
combination in wt-p53 solid tumors
In order to understand mechanism of action of
MI-219-oxaliplatin efficacy we first performed growth
inhibition and apoptosis studies in wt-p53 Capan-2,
HCT-116 and MCF-7 cancer cells. As can be seen from
results of Figure 1A, MI-219-oxaliplatin treatment
resulted in synergistically enhanced growth inhibition
in all three types of tumors. Isobologram analysis of the
combination treatment showed statistically significant
synergy (Combination Index CI<1 in all three cell lines
Figure 1 B). Then, we performed apoptosis assays that
showed similar trend with maximal apoptotic death
observed in MI-219-oxaliplatin treatment group (Figure
2). This combination was also found to be synergistic. We
also evaluated the inhibitory effect of colony formation

were grown in six well plates and treated with either MI-219 (15 µM) or oxaliplatin (15 µM) or the combination of MI-219 and Oxaliplatin
(15 µM each) for 32 hrs. At the end of the treatment period, cells were trypsinized washed twice with PBS. The pelleted cells were tested
for apoptosis using Annexin V FITC apoptosis assay according to the manufacturers guidelines (Biovision CA, USA Cat # K-101-100).

networks considering each perturbation in its entirety
without loosing key detail. Therefore, in order to delineate
the mechanism of synergy between MI-219-oxaliplatin,
microarrays were performed on RNA isolated from single
agent or combination treatment. As can be seen from
results of Figure 5A, each treatment (control, MI-219,
oxaliplatin and combination color coded) has a unique
set of associated gene signature. As expected of a targeted
drug, MI-219 as single agent induced a minimal of 48
gene alterations (Figure 5B smallest circle). Oxaliplatin, a
cytotoxic agent that has a well recognized toxicity, altered
761 genes. The combination treatment resulted in a total
of 767 gene changes (summarized in supplementary Table
1). However; of paramount significance is the emergence
of 286 synergy-unique genes that are not found in either
single agent treatment. This sizable number of genes
restricted to the combination treatment is indicative of a
true biological synergy between MI-219 and oxaliplatin.
Furthermore, our analysis shows that the entire set of
genes (24,927) could be pooled into four different groups
(20,128 non-differentially expressed with low variability;
4,129 differentially expressed with low variability; 238
differentially expressed with high variability and 432 nondifferentially expressed with high variability) (Figure 5C).

in all the three cell lines. In concordance with our growth
inhibition and apoptosis results, MI-219-oxaliplatin
blocked clonogenic capacity of the tested cell lines
(Figure 3). The above multiple assays clearly demonstrate
a synergistic interaction between the two drugs that leads
to enhanced growth inhibition in three different solid
tumor cell lines. We further evaluated the consequence
of combination treatment on activation of p53 pathway
using western blot analysis. As can be seen from results
of Figure 4, compared to single agent the combination
treatment resulted in slightly superior p53 and p21 reactivation. However, in order to prove that this is indeed
a biological synergy, we performed network modeling
on microarray obtained from individual and combination
treatment in the same cells.

Microarray profile MI-219-oxaliplatin indicates
modulation of unique set of genes
Systems and network modeling considers proteins
as components of a highly interactive network that crosstalks with different partners in its vicinity. This technology
can also be used to understand drug target response

potential. The plates were incubated in low CO2 days at 37°C in a 5% CO2/5% O2/90% N2 incubator. The colonies were stained with 2%
crystal violet and counted. The surviving fraction was normalized to untreated control cells with respect to clonogenic efficiency.

Network modeling of MI-219 mediated changes
at different time points

Such a large number of differentially expressed genes
with high variability are indicative of biomarker of drug
response.
Meta analysis of the total combination genes using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software showed
statistical enrichment in canonical pathways (pathways
include mitotic roles of polo-like kinases, cell cycle:
G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation, steroid
biosynthesis, ILK signaling, phenylalanine, tyrosine and
tryptophan biosynthesis pathways, valine, leucine and
isoleucine degradation, hereditary breast cancer signaling
and calcium induced T-lymphocytes apoptosis (Figure 6).
However, similar analysis of the synergy- unique genes
showed an entirely different set of statistical pathway
enrichment. In this case, the restricted set of pathways was
for cancer, gastrointestinal disorder, genetic disorder, cell
cycle and cell death (Figure 6). These results are a further
validation of the fact the combination synergy represents
biologically meaningful pathways and not resultant from
random set of events.

In order to understand the mechanism of MI-219
induced changes on oxaliplatin treatment, we performed
ingenuity modeling of the microarray datasets at different
time points. As can be seen from results of Figure 7A,
the initial response to MI-219 treatment (at 16 hrs) is the
activation of cell survival genes through NF-κB complex
formation. However, at later time points (32 hrs), this
survival signaling is diminished and we observe emergence
of multiple de-regulated signaling gene networks that are
indicative of cell death (Figure 7B). In order to verify
whether, these genetic events could be captured at the
functional level (protein expression), we performed
western blot analysis on cellular lysates obtained at the
two treatment time points. Figure 7C shows that at 16
hrs p65 (component of NF-κB) is highly expressed while
secondary hub such as EGR1 is not. However, at 32 hrs,
p65 expression is diminished while EGR1 is activated. Of
significance is the fact that the protein expression pattern
induced by MI-219 in PDAC (Capan-2 cells) could be

replicated in an entirely distinct tumor cell line HCT-116.
Once we obtained insight of the mechanism/perturbations
induced by MI-219 as a single agent, we explored that
changes in combination treatment and are discussed in the
forthcoming passages.

These data further provide evidence for the uniqueness of
each treatment signature. Our analysis also showed the
activation of EGR1 network (Supplementary Figure 1)
and p53-CDKN2A hub (Supplementary Figure 2) that in
principle drives optimal p53 activation. The activation of
multiple hubs driving p53 is indicative of a true synergy
between MI-219-oxaliplatin and suggests clinical testing
of this combination would be of benefit to patients with
wt-p53 solid tumors.

Change in information flow upon combination
treatment: Towards cell death
Apoptotic cells undergo a rapid change in genetic
information directed towards de-regulated signaling
leading to cell death. To provide evidence for this, our
analysis of the combination genes at late time point (32
hrs) showed dramatic changes in information flow that
led to the activation of the anti-tumor E-Cadherin hub,
(CDH1 protein) (Figure 8; Red showing up regulated
genes and green showing down regulated genes). This is
in agreement with earlier studies showing that in addition
to regulating cell junction, E-Cadherin network responds
to different stresses leading to apoptotic cell death [26].
The second activated hub observed in the 32 hr treatment
group was the NF-κB complex-CREB axis (Figure 9). This
was a different expression pattern compared to MI-219
single agent treatment that showed suppression of NF-kB.

Validation of synergy genes at the functional level
The changes in gene expression observed in the
microarray analysis of MI-219-oxaliplatin combination
synergy provide inconclusive evidence of the mechanism
of action unless their functional/effector translational
product is validated at the protein level. Therefore, in
order to validate our network findings at the functional
(or biological) level, we analyzed the protein product
of prominent hub genes observed in the synergy using
western blot analysis. The protein expression analysis was
performed in PDAC, colon and breast cell lines in order to
assess whether the uniqueness of the synergy genes could
be translated to other tumors as well. As can be seen from

Figure 9: Global changes in gene homeostasis showing activation of NF-kB-CREB axis in synergy unique dataset.
Triplicate datasets of the synergy unique genes were analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis software and demonstrated activation of
NF-kB module in tandem with CREB. Note all genes shown here are up-regulated.

results of Fig 10, along with the enhancement of p53,
combination treatment enhances CREBBP, E-Cadherin
and CARF protein expression in all the cell lines tested.
That this was observed in two tumor cells lines distinct
from PDAC clearly confirms that the observed activity of
MI-219 and oxaliplatin is not a cell-specific phenomenon.
These results are of paramount significance since they
indicate that MI-219-oxaliplatin combination can become
an effective for a wide range of wt-p53 tumors and not
restricted to PDAC.

oxaliplatin mediated growth inhibition (MTT Top Panel)
and apoptosis (Annexin V FITC Bottom Panel) in all the
three cell lines. These results proved that p53 is central
player in the efficacy of MI-219-oxaliplatin. Following
this, we individually knocked down CREBBP, EGR1,
CDKN2A (p16) and p65 and found that siRNA silencing
suppresses the efficacy of MI-219-Oxaliplatin in three
different cell types (data not shown). Most interestingly,
silencing E-Cadherin exhibited the opposite effect and
enhanced the potential of MI-219-oxaliplatin (Figure
12). These results support our previous ingenuity gene
networks studies (Figure 8) where we found changes in
information flow in the E-Cadherin hub in response to
combination treatment.

siRNA silencing confirms the crucial requirement
of synergy unique genes in MI-219-Oxaliplatin
combination efficacy

Discussion

Once we establish the enhancement of CBP300 (a
CREBBP), CARF, E-Cadherin and NF-κB-p65 (p65)
at the protein level, we sought to investigate the effect
of silencing individual genes and validate their role in
the observed synergy between MI-219-oxaliplatin. We
individually knocked down the above mentioned genes
and tested the Capan-2, HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells for
growth inhibition and apoptosis by MI-219-oxaliplatin.
First, we analyzed the role of p53 in the observed apoptosis
by MI-219 and oxaliplatin. As can be seen from results
of Fig 11, siRNA knockdown of p53 abrogated MI-219-

In this clinically translatable study, we have, for the
first time, used integrated network modeling and systems
biology to delineate the mechanism of synergy between
MDM2 targeted small molecule drug (MI-219) and
oxaliplatin in wt-p53 solid tumors. Based on these novel
results, we anticipate that our presented information will
aid in the clinical design of this potent combination in a
genetically predefined subset of wt-p53 carrying cancer
patients and will be a step towards tailored therapy.
Our laboratory has been focused on delineating

aspirated and replenished with fresh media containing either vehicle alone of MI-219+Oxaliplatin combination (15µM each). The cells
were incubated for 32 hrs followed and at the end of the treatment period, cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS followed by extraction
of protein for western blot analysis. Preparation of cellular lysates, protein concentration determination and SDS-PAGE analysis has been
previously described (28). Equal amounts of protein were analyzed for p53, E-Cadherin, CARF and CREBBP by Western Blotting. The
membranes were re-probed with β-actin as loading control. Note that the patterns of gene expression were similar in all three cell lines.

the molecular mechanisms of action of a potent MDM2
inhibitor MI-219 in solid tumors. MI-219 is a specific,
orally active, low molecular weight inhibitor, that
binds to the p53 binding pocket of MDM2 and disrupts
the MDM2-p53 interaction leading to apoptosis via
reactivating wt-p53 in wt-p53 cancer cells [27,28].
However, this inhibitor is, by itself, a non genotoxic agent.
We are of the opinion that for effective and clinically
beneficial activation of p53, it is logical to combine an
MDM2 inhibitor with genotoxic drugs that activate p53.
Indeed, MDM2 inhibitor synergizes with platinum drugs
leading to 50% tumor free survival in PDAC xenograft
model [19]. Earlier work by Blagosklonny and group have

demonstrated that a combination of MDM2 inhibitors and
DNA-damaging drugs super-induce p53 and that was
considered as a mechanism of synergy [29]. However,
the precise mechanism of this synergy has not been fully
characterized at the molecular level. Additionally, a
number of critical networks including microRNA circuits
have been shown to crosstalk with p53 family members
p63 and p73 that ultimately governs therapeutic efficacy
of drug treatment [30]. Given the complex network of
interaction between MDM2 and p53 that ultimately
governs apoptosis, it is reasonable to predict that
analyzing the local network of crucial members may help
understand and elucidate the cellular response to MI-219.

In the case of MI-219, elucidating important key protein/
pathways will help us in identifying patients who are more
likely to respond to MI-219 treatment, which will provide
molecular guidance for conducting rationally designed
and tailored combination trials.
In this report, we demonstrated that in MI219oxaliplatin combination has far superior anticancer
effects than either agent alone in three wt-p53 yet distinct
solid tumors types (Pancreatic, Colon and Breast).
Isobologram analysis of the combination ratios confirmed
that MI-219 and oxaliplatin work in a synergistic (CI<1
in all cases) and not in an additive manner. However,
lack of mechanistic studies supporting this synergistic
combination in a wide spectrum of tumors suggests that
further research is necessary. Taking a systems biology
approach, we investigated whether the observed synergy
between MI-219 and oxaliplatin is indeed the result of
orchestrated network of molecular events that drive p53
reactivation towards enhanced apoptosis. As expected of
a targeted agent, global analysis of genes from microarray
profiling showed that MI-219 treatment resulted limited
set of only 48 gene alterations. On the other hand, the well
recognized cytotoxic agent oxaliplatin induced alterations
in a larger number of genes (761 genes). The combination
of MI-219 with oxaliplatin resulted in 767 genes being
altered that were not significantly related to MI-219oxaliplatin synergy. The most intriguing aspect of this
finding is the emergence of 286 synergy-specific unique
genes that were not found in MI-219 or oxaliplatin single
treatment group (Fig 2 A). These findings confirm that
synergy between MI-219 and oxaliplatin emanates from
a well orchestrated set of specific genetic perturbations.
This is further supported by our ingenuity analysis of
combination and synergy unique gene pools that showed
some highly contrasting differences between combination
events and synergistic events. The synergy unique 287
genes were pooled into 14 closely knit functional groups
as demonstrated through the ingenuity pathway system.
Significantly, in contrast to the enrichment of large set
of canonical pathways in total combinations genes, the
specific synergy-unique associated 14 networks were
restricted to cancer, gastrointestinal disease, genetic
disorder, cell cycle and cell death pathway.
EGR1 is well recognized to directly induce
the transcription of p53 and binds to p53 forming a
cytoplasmic complex [31]. Direct binding of the p53
promoter by Egr1 was first shown in human melanoma
A375-C6 cells during thapsigargin-induced apoptosis
[32]. Studies of the Egr1-null mouse system have revealed
that Egr1 normally controls p53 expression leading to cell
cycle arrest and senescence [33]. These cells express little
or no p53 although the gene is intact. This suggested that
p53 activation by MDM2 inhibitor as single agent or in
combination with oxaliplatin could be aided by EGR1
co-expression. In line with this, we observed activation
of EGR1 network by MDM2-oxaliplatin treatment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and this was validated at the protein level in PDAC,
colon and breast cells. Furthermore, siRNA silencing of
EGR1 abrogated in MI219-oxaliplatin efficacy and thus,
reaffirmed the critical role of EGR1 in synergy of the two
drugs.
CREB binding protein (CREBBP) is a large (~300
KDa) pleiotropic cellular coactivator protein critical to
the execution of virtually all known cellular programs,
including cell growth, differentiation, the integration
of both signal-dependent and -independent cellular
responses, and apoptosis. CREBBP and its sister protein
p300 are highly conserved in multicellular organisms and
have been shown to have profound effects on somatic
differentiation during early embryogenesis [34,35]. The
transcriptional activity of p53, which is tightly linked to
its tumor suppressor function, appears to depend upon
efficient recruitment of CREBBP to p53 target promoters.
Consistent with this observation, recent studies have
shown that the activation domain of p53 participates in
CREBBP recruitment [36]. Taken together, these findings
indicate that CREBBP plays a critical role in supporting
p53-dependent transcription function. Results from
our network modeling also demonstrated a statistical
enhancement of CREBBP hub and western blotting verified
this activation at the protein level. Similar to EGR1,
siRNA silencing of CREBBP resulted in diminished MI219-oxaliplatin activity in PDAC, colon and breast cells.
These results again indicate that CREBBP plays a definite
role in optimizing p53 re-activation by MI219-oxaliplatin.
MI-219-oxaliplatin network analysis also showed
emergence of a driver NF-κB network. NF-κB is a master
transcriptional regulator that is known to regulate a number
of critical genes governing normal homeostasis of cell
[37]. In cancer, activation of NF-κB has been associated
with poor prognosis and resistance to drug treatment [38].
MI-219-oxaliplatin drug response signatures showed
that NFκB expression was downregulated and secondary
networks (EGR1 hub) were activated that drove growth
inhibition and apoptosis. We also observed constitutive
activation of the NF-κB-CREBB axis. This points to the
previously unrecognized role of NF-κB in p53 mediated
apoptosis. However, this regulatory network especially
in response to MI-219, oxaliplatin or combination is still
poorly understood and requires further investigation.
Pharmaceutical strategies to re-activate p53 has been
a topic of intense research in recent years and a number of
potent small molecules are either in PhaseI/II or entering
clinical trial [13]. Instead of rushing these promising MDM2
inhibitors into the clinic, a comprehensive understanding
of their mechanism of action is first, absolutely necessary
and network modeling can aid in this effort. In conclusion,
we have demonstrated by using network modeling, that
unique driver networks which play a critical role in MI219-oxaliplatin synergy can be identified and functionally
verified. These synergy networks coerce an orchestrated
set of events that cumulatively optimize p53 re-activation

siRNA and transfections
To study the effect of MI-219-oxaliplatin
combination on re-activating p53 in the presence of p53
siRNA, E-Cadherin siRNA, EGR1 siRNA and p65 siRNA
and CDKN2A (p16) siRNA, we utilized siRNA silencing
technology in Capan-2, HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells. The
respective siRNAs and control siRNA were obtained from
Cell Signaling. Cells were transfected with either p53
siRNA, E-Cadherin siRNA, EGR1 siRNA or p65 siRNA
for 5 hrs using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Cell Signaling). After the siRNA
treatment period cells were further treated with MI-219oxaliplatin combination in 96 well plates for MTT and 6
well plates for Annexin V FITC assays respectively.

Material and Methods
Cell culture, experimental reagents and chemicals
Capan-2 (PDAC; wt-p53) cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HCT-116
(Colon cancer; wt-p53) cells were generously provided
by Dr. Vogelstein’s group. MCF-7 (Breast cancer; wtp53) cells were obtained Karmanos Cancer Institute,
Detroit Michigan. These cell lines have been tested and
authenticated in our core facility, Applied Genomics
Technology Center at Wayne State University, as late as
March 13, 2009. The method used for testing was short
tandem repeat (STR) profiling using the PowerPlex® 16
System from Promega (Madison, WI). Primary antibodies
for p53, EGR1, CBP300 (a CREBBP), E Cadherin,
MDM2 and p21 were purchased from Cell Signaling
(Beverly MA). All secondary antibodies were obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). MI-219 was synthesized by
using our previously published methods [39,40].

Western blot analysis
Capan-2, HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells were exposed
to either MI-219, oxaliplatin or their combination for 16
and 32 hrs followed by extraction of protein for western
blot analysis. Preparation of cellular lysates, protein
concentration determination and SDS-PAGE analysis has
been previously described. [44].

Microarrays and Gene Expression Analysis
Gene expression networks from Capan-2 cells were
determined from an analysis of global gene expression
time series data. Cells were plated so that they reached
75% confluence after 3 days. At this point cultures were
treated with either MI-219 (15 µM) or oxaliplatin (15 µM)
or their combination and RNA was isolated from triplicate
parallel plated plates at 16 and 32 hours after addition of
inhibitor. Media was changed the day after plating and
at the start of treatment. Quantitative measurement and
the high quality of all mRNA samples were assured by
analysis with the NanoDrop 1000, Agilent Bioanylizer and
the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies,
Waldbronn, Germany). Expression levels at each time
point for each cell and treatment were determined by
microarray analyses using the Illumina human HT12 array.
Data were processed for quality control and normalized

Cell growth inhibition studies by MTT and
clonogenic assay
Capan-2, HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells were seeded in a
96-well culture plate (at a density of 3 x 103 cells per well)
and treated with different ratios of MI-219 (0-30 µM),
or oxaliplatin (0-30 µM) or their combination for 32 hrs
and MTT assay was performed as described earlier [41].
The results were plotted as means ± SD of three separate
experiments using six determinations per experiment for
each experimental condition. Clonogenic assay for cell
survival on the three cell lines was performed according
to previously described methods [42].

across compared arrays by quantile normalization. Genes
with 1.7 or greater expression fold-change at any time
point in the series were included in Ingenuity Pathways
Analyses. Cluster analysis of expression profiles was
performed with Bayesian analysis using CAGED software.
Canonical pathways analysis identified the pathways from
the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis library of canonical
pathways that were most significant to the data set.
Molecules from the data set that met the 1.7 fold-change
cut-off and were associated with a canonical pathway
in Ingenuity’s Knowledge Base were considered for the
analysis. The significance of the association between
the data set and the canonical pathway was measured
in 2 ways: 1) A ratio of the number of molecules from
the dataset that map to the pathway divided by the total
number of molecules that map to the canonical pathway.
2) Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate a p-value
determining the probability that the association between
the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway is
explained by chance alone.
