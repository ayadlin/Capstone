Abstract
The eukaryotic elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) is known to
retain oncogenic potential and is recognized as a novel
target for cancer prevention and therapy. Resveratrol (trans3,4¶,5-trihydroxystilbene), a phytoalexin present in grapes,
has been reported to possess chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activities. In the present study, we examined the
growth-inhibitory effects of resveratrol in human ovarian
cancer PA-1 cells, considering eEF1A2 as a potential
molecular target. Pretreatment with resveratrol attenuated
proliferation of serum-starved PA-1 cells stimulated with
insulin or serum. Resveratrol also activated caspase-9, -7,
and -3 and induced apoptosis in PA-1 cells in the presence of
insulin or serum. Insulin or serum stimulation of PA-1 cells
resulted in the marked induction of eEF1A2, which was
suppressed by pretreatment with resveratrol. Moreover,
resveratrol inhibited insulin- or serum-induced soft-agar
colony formation in eEF1A2-transfected NIH3T3 cells. An
antibody array directed to assess the phosphorylation of
protein kinases revealed that treatment with insulin or
serum induced the phosphorylation of Akt in PA-1 cells.
Pharmacologic inhibition of Akt with LY294002 abrogated
insulin- or serum-induced eEF1A2 expression and increased
the caspase-3 activity. In another experiment, i.p. administration of resveratrol retarded the growth of PA-1 cell
xenograft and the expression of eEF1A2 in athymic nude
mice in association with decreased bromodeoxyuridine
positivity, reduced expression of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen, increased the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling and caspase-3 staining,
and diminished CD31 positivity. Taken together, eEF1A2 may
be considered as a potential molecular target for the
antiproliferative effects of resveratrol in PA-1 ovarian cancer
cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7449–58]

Ovarian cancer is a "silent killer" that represents one of the

majority of patients, the early-stage malignancy is barely detected
and symptoms are evident after spreading to the surfaces of the
peritoneal cavity. The overall 5-year survival rate in patients with
early-stage disease is >90%, while advanced-stage patients have a
survival rate of 15% to 30% only (2). Conventional approaches, such
as cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy (3), have limited
success in controlling ovarian cancer due to chemotherapy
resistance and high recurrence rate (4, 5).
It has been well recognized that deregulated cell signaling
pathways comprising a wide variety of proteins involved in cell
proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis largely account for the
development and progression of cancer (6). The eukaryotic
protein translation elongation factor appears to be a critical
regulator of the protein repertoire of the cell. The eEF1A family
of peptide elongation factor comprises two isoforms, eEF1A1 and
eEF1A2, encoded by different chromosomes but sharing 98%
homology (7). Whereas the eEF1A1 is widely expressed in almost
all tissues, the eEF1A2 is normally expressed in brain, heart, and
skeletal muscle (7–9). Recent studies have revealed that
members of eEF1A family play a critical role in carcinogenesis
(10, 11). The role of eEF1A2 in carcinogenesis has been
addressed by Anand and colleagues (10), who have shown that
eEF1A2 is overexpressed in 30% of ovarian tumors and
established ovarian cancer cells. According to this study, the
overexpression of eEF1A2 causes transformation of rodent
fibroblasts (NIH3T3) cells and stimulates the growth of ovarian
cancer (ES-2) cell xenograft in nude mice (10). Subsequent
studies have revealed that eEF1A2 is overexpressed in primary
breast tumors (12) and is positively correlated with the growth
of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (13). Recently, eEF1A2 has been
recognized as a biomarker for cancers of breast (12), lung (14),
and prostate (15). Therefore, targeted inhibition of eEF1A2 may
represent a pragmatic approach for the chemoprevention/
chemotherapeutic intervention of ovarian cancer.
An adequate intake of fruits and vegetables is inversely
correlated with the risk of ovarian cancer (16, 17). Resveratrol
(trans-3,4¶,5-trihydroxystilbene), a phytoalexin present in grapes,
has been extensively studied for its chemopreventive and
chemotherapeutic effects in various cancer cells as well as in
animal models (18). However, data on chemopreventive and/or
chemotherapeutic potential of resveratrol in ovarian cancer are
still limited. Resveratrol prevents angiogenesis (19), induces
autophagocytosis (20), and alleviates chemotherapy resistance
(21) in ovarian cancer cells. Here, we report that resveratrol
inhibits insulin- or serum-induced growth of ovarian cancer PA-1
cells in culture and xenograft in nude mice by down-regulating
the expression of eEF1A2 via the blockade of upstream Akt
activation.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Resveratrol (purity >99%), insulin, and MTT were
procured from Sigma-Aldrich. MEM, DMEM, RPMI 1640, and fetal
bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen (Life Technologies).
Primary antibodies for caspase-3, -7, and -9, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase, phospho-Akt, and Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology. The eEF1A2 antibody was constructed by Takara Korea by
changing the peptide sequence from mouse to human (22). Primary
antibodies for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and CD31 were
procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were
purchased from Zymed Laboratory. LY294002 was purchased from
Tocris.
Cell culture and stable transfection. PA-1, TOV-112D, and SK-OV-3
human ovarian cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
cultured in MEM supplemented with sodium pyruvate (1 mmol/L; for PA-1
and TOV-112D) and in RPMI 1640 enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum
( for SK-OV-3), each containing 100 units penicillin and streptomycin.
NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with a blank vector or eEF1A2 plasmid
cloned into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1-v5-HisA (Invitrogen) using
Fugene-6 (Roche) and transfection was confirmed by using G418 (Roche).
NIH3T3-vector and NIH3T3-eEF1A2 clones were grown in DMEM enriched
with 10% bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2.
Cell proliferation assay. Cells were cultured for 12, 24, and 48 h in
the presence of varying concentrations of resveratrol dissolved in 0.1%
DMSO. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay (23). For the trypan
blue exclusion assay, PA-1 cells were kept starved for 48 h and then
treated with different concentrations of resveratrol 1 h before addition of

serum or insulin. After 12 h, cells were harvested and counted after
treatment with 0.4% trypan blue.
Anchorage-independent growth assay. PA-1 or NIH3T3 (vector-transfected or eEF1A2-transfected) cells (1 mL; 2  104 cells/mL) suspended in
0.33% agarose solution were poured over hard-bottomed agar previously
solidified in each 6-well plate. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of resveratrol twice a week for 3 weeks and incubated at 37jC in
95% air/5% CO2. Colonies (>100 Am) were scored and photographed after
3 weeks as described previously (24).
Western blot analysis. Serum-starved PA-1 cells were incubated with
or without resveratrol or LY294002 for 1 h before treatment with insulin
or serum for 12 h. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in cell lysis buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L Na2EDTA,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate, 1 Ag/mL
leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and centrifuged
at 20,817  g for 15 min. The supernatant was harvested as cellular
protein extract. Protein samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis
as described (24). Membranes were probed with antibodies against
eEF1A2, actin, phospho-Akt (Ser473), and Akt and blots were visualized
according to the procedure described previously (24).
DNA fragmentation assay. Serum-starved PA-1 cells were treated
with resveratrol or LY294002 for 1 h followed by treatment with insulin
(10 Ag/mL) or serum (1%) for 12 h. Fragmented DNA in the cell lysates was
extracted according to the procedure described earlier (25). The DNA
fragments were separated by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and
visualized under UV light.
Caspase-3 activity assay. The caspase-3 activity was measured by
using Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Biovision) as a substrate. Cells

Proteome profiler array. Antibody array was done according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cell lysates were reacted with activated array
membranes for overnight at 2jC to 8jC. Each array membrane was washed
three times with 1 wash buffer and incubated with the diluted antibody
cocktail for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with 1 wash

buffer, and further incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase for
30 min at room temperature. Each array membrane was then washed three
times with 1 wash buffer and exposed with chemiluminescent reagents to
X-ray film.

resveratrol (dissolved in 5% ethanol and 25% polyethyleneglycol 400 in
distilled water) i.p. at a daily dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight for
consecutive 4 weeks, whereas the other group received the vehicle only.
Body weights were recorded everyday. Animals were given bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) 2 h before sacrifice.

using anti-rabbit or anti-goat horseradish peroxidase Envision System
(DAKO). Finally, counterstaining was done using Mayer’s hematoxylin.
Xenograft tissue sections were also subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (28).

Results
Resveratrol inhibited serum- or insulin-induced growth of
ovarian cancer PA-1 cells. Treatment of human ovarian cancer
(PA-1, TOV-112D, and SK-OV-3) cells with resveratrol (25, 50, 100, or
200 Amol/L) resulted in decreased cell viability in a concentrationand time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A). Of these ovarian cancer cells,
PA-1 cells were the most susceptible to growth inhibition by
resveratrol. As shown in Fig. 1B, incubation of serum-starved PA-1
cells with insulin (10 Ag/mL) or serum (1%) for 12 h increased cell
viability, which was significantly diminished by pretreatment with
resveratrol (25 or 50 Amol/L) in a concentration-dependent
manner.
Resveratrol induced apoptosis in PA-1 cells. To clarify
whether resveratrol-induced inhibition of PA-1 cell growth is partly
attributed to its ability to induce apoptosis, we examined the effect
of resveratrol on the activation of some representative caspases
and the fragmentation of DNA, a biochemical hallmark
of apoptosis. Pretreatment of PA-1 cells with resveratrol (25 or
50 Amol/L) caused fragmentation of DNA (Fig. 2A) as well as
proteolytic activation of caspase-3, -7, and -9 and cleavage of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 2B) in the presence of insulin

eEF1A2 functions as an oncogene in various human malignancies

and its modulation by resveratrol. Incubation with insulin or serum
induced the expression of eEF1A2 in serum-starved PA-1 cells,
which was abolished by cycloheximide (Fig. 3A), suggesting that
these growth stimuli can induce the de novo synthesis of eEF1A2.
Pretreatment of PA-1 cells with resveratrol (50 Amol/L) for
1 h significantly decreased insulin- or serum-induced expression
of eEF1A2 (Fig. 3B and C), whereas treatment of cells with
resveratrol alone decreased the basal expression of eEF1A2
(Supplementary Fig. S1). However, the insulin- or serum-induced
expression of other peptide elongation factors, such as eEF1A1 and
eEF2, remained unaltered by resveratrol pretreatment (Fig. 3D).

Resveratrol inhibited eEF1A2 expression by blocking Akt in
serum- or insulin-stimulated PA-1 cells. To identify the
upstream signaling kinases responsible for resveratrol-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in insulin- or serumstimulated PA-1 cells, we performed the proteome profiler antibody
array analysis (Proteome Profiler; R&D Systems). This array can
measure the relative levels of phosphorylation of nine representative mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as extracellular signalregulated protein kinase 1/2, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1-3,
different p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase isoforms, and nine
other serine/threonine kinases including Akt, glycogen synthase

kinase-3, and p70S6 kinase. We found that insulin induced
phosphorylation of Akt1 (S473), Akt2 (S474), and pan (S473, S474,
and S472), which was inhibited by resveratrol as well as the Akt
inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 4A). These results were further confirmed
by Western blot analysis. PA-1 cells starved with serum-free
medium for 48 h were treated with either resveratrol or LY294002
for 1 h before incubation with insulin or serum for additional 12 h.
Intracellular levels of phospho-Akt were diminished by pretreatment with either resveratrol or LY294002 (Fig. 4B). However,
the expression of PTEN, a negative regulator of phosphoinositide
3-kinase/Akt signaling, remained unchanged. To determine whether Akt could play a role in eEF1A2 up-regulation, the Akt inhibitor
LY294002 was employed. As illustrated in Fig. 4C, pharmacologic
inhibition of Akt abrogated eEF1A2 expression induced by insulin
or serum. In addition, pretreatment of starved PA-1 cells with
LY294002 restored the caspase-3 activity, which is prone to
repression by insulin or serum supplementation (Fig. 4D),
suggesting that Akt signaling is responsible, at least in part, for
insulin- or serum-induced eEF1A2 expression and subsequent
stimulation of proliferation in PA-1 cells.
eEF1A2 as a molecular target for resveratrol-induced
growth inhibition. Resveratrol caused dose-dependent inhibition
of anchorage-independent growth of PA-1 cells as revealed by the
reduced number of colonies (Fig. 5A). To further investigate
whether eEF1A2 is a plausible molecular target for antiproliferative
activity of resveratrol, we examined the effect of resveratrol on
anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells stably transfected
with eEF1A2. As shown in Fig. 5B, there was a significant increase
in the number of colonies in eEF1A2-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells
(NIH3T3-eEF1A2) compared with that observed in the control
(NIH3T3-vector) cells in the soft-agar colony formation assay.
Treatment with resveratrol (12.5 or 25 Amol/L) dose-dependently
attenuated the growth of NIH3T3-eEF1A2 cells compared with
NIH3T3-vector control cells. Addition of insulin to the medium did
not further increase the number of colonies in NIH3T3-eEF1A2
cells, but the average size of colonies was larger compared with
that exhibited in the untreated cells (data not shown).
Resveratrol attenuated the growth of PA-1 cell xenograft.
Because resveratrol suppressed the proliferation of PA-1 cells and
diminished the expression of eEF1A2, we examined whether
resveratrol could inhibit the growth of PA-1 cells transplanted to
athymic mice and the expression of eEF1A2 in vivo. The average
volume (Fig. 6A) and mass (Fig. 6B) of tumors were significantly
reduced by resveratrol. The average tumor volume was reduced
by treatment with resveratrol at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight
(195.5 F 124.8 mm3; P < 0.05) or 100 mg/kg body weight (81.7 F
70.5 mm3; P < 0.001) compared with the vehicle-treated animals
(315 F 94 mm3). There was a good correlation between the tumor
volume and the tumor mass (Fig. 6B, inset). However, there were no
significant differences in the body weight of animals between
control and resveratrol-treated groups (Fig. 6A, inset). It was
noticeable that the growth of PA-1 cell xenografts in vivo was
associated with a marked increase in eEF1A2 expression (Fig. 6C),
which was diminished by resveratrol. Immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that resveratrol significantly inhibited the tumor
cell proliferation as judged by decreased BrdUrd labeling and
reduced PCNA expression. Compared with a vehicle control, PA-1
cell xenograft treated with resveratrol showed a marked increase in
TUNEL positivity and caspase-3 staining (Fig. 6C). Moreover,
resveratrol diminished the expression of CD31, a vascular endothelial cell marker (30), and microvessel density (Fig. 6C). Statistical

Discussion
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic
malignancies (1). The early-stage ovarian cancer is asymptomatic,
and f75% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (1).
Despite substantial progress in the development of anticancer
therapies, the 5-year survival rate of advanced-stage ovarian cancer
patients still remains low (1, 31). An adequate intake of fruits and
vegetables can halt or reverse the promotion and progression of
certain cancers (6). Resveratrol, present in grapes and many other
edible plants, has been extensively investigated as a promising
candidate chemopreventive agent (18, 32). Resveratrol exerts its
antitumorigenic effects by inhibiting the growth and inducing
apoptosis in various cancer cells (18, 33). However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying inhibitory effects of resveratrol on the
growth of cancer cells remain elusive. In the present study, we
report that resveratrol inhibits the growth of human ovarian cancer
PA-1 cells through inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of
apoptosis by targeting the protein elongation factor eEF1A2.
Insulin is one of the risk factors for ovarian cancer. High insulin
levels have been suggested to cause obesity (34), which is
associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer (35). Insulin, a
growth stimulus for cancer cells, functions as a tumor promoter
(34). It has been shown that insulin has high affinity for insulin-like
growth factor-I receptor, which is overexpressed in ovarian
carcinoma cells (36). A high incidence of ovarian cancer has been
noted in insulin-treated type I diabetic patients (37). We therefore
examined the antiproliferative effects of resveratrol in PA-1 cells on
stimulation with insulin or serum. Incubation of serum-starved
PA-1 cells with insulin and/or serum increased cell proliferation,
which was significantly diminished by resveratrol pretreatment.
The inhibitory effect of resveratrol on the growth of PA-1 cells was
further confirmed by the significant suppression of anchorageindependent growth of these cells in a soft-agar colony formation
assay. Tyagi and colleagues (38) also showed that resveratrol
inhibited proliferation of PA-1 and SK-OV-3 cells in culture.
Although resveratrol exerts antiproliferative effects by acting as a
selective estrogen receptor modulator (39), the absence of estrogen
receptor in PA-1 cells suggests that the antiproliferative effect of
resveratrol in PA-1 cells is independent of estrogen receptor–
mediated signaling.
Pretreatment of serum-starved PA-1 cells with resveratrol
resulted in increased DNA fragmentation and caspase activation,
even under growth stimulation by insulin or serum, corroborating
the ability of resveratrol to induce apoptosis, which is in agreement
with the induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis by the
compound in A2780 ovarian cancer cells (20). In contrast,
resveratrol did not alter cell viability in cisplatin-resistant A2780
(A2780/CP70) and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells (19), suggesting
that the compound exerts cell type–specific effects on the growth
of ovarian cancer cells.
Although resveratrol has been widely investigated for its
chemopreventive potential, a prime molecular target for its
antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects in ovarian cancer
is yet to be identified. Within the myriad of cell signaling molecules
implicated in cancer, resveratrol targets a series of protein

eEF1A2 as a Potential Chemopreventive Target of Resveratrol

translation machinery (19). Resveratrol attenuated insulin-like
growth factor-I–induced phosphorylation of different translation
initiation factors in A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3 cells (19). Besides
translation initiation factors, peptide elongations factors have also
been implicated in carcinogenesis (10, 40). Beyond its housekeeping role in protein synthesis, the peptide elongation factor eEF1A2
acts as an oncogene for cancers of the breast (12), liver (13), lung
(14), pancreas (41), and ovary (10).
Because eEF1A2 functions as an inhibitor of caspase-mediated
apoptosis as well as a putative oncogene for ovarian cancer (10, 29,
42), we examined the role of eEF1A2 in insulin- or serum-induced
proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Treatment of serum-starved
PA-1 ovarian cancer cells with insulin or serum elevated the
expression of eEF1A2, which was abrogated by pretreatment with
cycloheximide, suggesting the de novo synthesis of eEF1A2 in
response to growth stimuli. The significant decrease in insulin- or
serum-induced expression of eEF1A2, but not of eEF1A1 and eEF2,
by resveratrol suggests that eEF1A2 might be a prime target of
resveratrol in retarding cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in
PA-1 cells. The significant increase in the number of colonies in
eEF1A2-transfected NIH3T3 cells in comparison with vectortransfected NIH3T3 cells and its suppression by resveratrol further
suggest that eEF1A2 is a potential molecular target for resveratrolinduced growth retardation.
Resveratrol is known to inhibit inappropriate activation of a
panel of upstream kinases involved in cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis (18, 32, 33). An antibody array directed to identify
upstream cellular signaling molecules involved in the insulininduced expression of eEF1A2 revealed an increase in the
phosphorylation of Akt1 (at S473 residue), Akt2 (at S474 residue),
and Akt pan (at S472, S473, and S474 residues), which were
diminished by pretreatment with resveratrol or the Akt inhibitor
LY294002. Consistent with our findings, resveratrol inhibited
phosphorylation of Akt in A2780 cells (43) and insulin-like growth
factor-I–stimulated A2780/CP80 and OVCAR-3 cells (19). Because
Akt is a critical mediator of cell survival (44), the inhibition of
insulin- or serum-induced phosphorylation of Akt in PA-1 cells by
resveratrol suggests Akt as one of its key molecular targets.
Because eEF1A2 is phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues
by various tyrosine kinases (45), Akt may be an upstream regulator
of eEF1A2. The suppression of insulin- or serum-induced
expression of eEF1A2 in starved PA-1 cells preincubated with
LY294002 suggests that Akt functions as an upstream regulator of
eEF1A2. Because pretreatment of PA-1 cells with LY294002 restored
caspase activity in the presence of insulin or serum, it can be
inferred that resveratrol induced apoptosis in PA-1 cells by
down-regulating eEF1A2 via suppression of Akt. In contrast,
the expression of eEF1A2 causes activation of phosphoinositide
3-kinase/Akt, which in turn stimulates cell migration, invasion, and

filopodia formation in BT-549 cells (46). According to a recent
study, eEF1A2 interacts with peroxiredoxin-I and inhibits apoptosis
by down-regulating caspase-3 and -8 and up-regulating Akt in
cultured cardiomyocytes and myotubes (47). Therefore, it would be
worthwhile to examine if resveratrol induces apoptosis through
modulation of peroxiredoxin-I and to clarify the presence of a
positive feedback loop linking eEF1A2 expression and subsequent
activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling.
The promoter region of eEF1A2 contains 12 E-boxes, 3 Egr
family of proteins, 1 GATA motif, and 1 MEF2 binding site (48).
However, insulin or serum stimulation of PA-1 cells failed to
induce the DNA binding of Egr1 and MEF1 (data not shown).
Analysis of promoter sequences of eEF1A2 revealed the presence
of binding motifs for other transcription factors, such as
activator protein-1, activator protein-2a, and specificity protein1. Incubation of PA-1 cells with insulin or serum also failed to
induce the DNA binding of these transcription factors (data not
shown). Further analysis of eEF1A2 promoter might help to
identify transcription factors involved in insulin- or seruminduced transcriptional activation of eEF1A2.
Consistent with the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on the
growth of other implanted cancer cells (49, 50), we show that
the compound can also inhibit the growth of ovarian cancer cell
xenografts. The decreased eEF1A2 expression in association with
increased TUNEL positivity, caspase-3 activation, reduced BrdUrd
labeling, and decreased PCNA expression in resveratrol-treated
PA-1 cell xenograft is well correlated with the antiproliferative
and apoptotic effects of the compound in the same animal
tumor model. Moreover, the attenuation of CD31 expression and
microvessel density in PA-1 cell-xenograft suggests the antiangiogenic effect of resveratrol in ovarian cancer. In conclusion,
the present study reveals that resveratrol significantly inhibits
the growth of PA-1 human ovarian cancer cells in association
with reduced eEF1A2 expression, suggesting this peptide
elongation factor as a novel molecular target of resveratrol.
