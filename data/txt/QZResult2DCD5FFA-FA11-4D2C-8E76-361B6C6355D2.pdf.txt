Abstract
Although the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is
highly effective for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+) acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, relapse with emerging imatinib
resistance mutations in the BCR/ABL kinase domain poses a
significant problem. Here, we show that the multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis at much lower concentrations in Ton.B210 cells when
driven by inducibly expressed BCR/ABL than when driven by
interleukin-3. The increased sensitivity to sorafenib was also
observed in cells inducibly expressing BCR/ABL with the
imatinib-resistant E255K or T315I mutation. Sorafenibinduced apoptosis in these cells and Ph+ leukemic cells was
synergistically enhanced by rottlerin, bortezomib, or ABT-737
and inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-d-fmk or the
overexpression of Bcl-XL. It was further revealed that
sorafenib activates Bax and caspase-3 and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential specifically in BCR/ABL–driven
cells. Sorafenib also inhibited BCR/ABL–induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of its cellular substrates and its autophosphorylation in Ton.B210. It was finally shown that sorafenib
inhibits the kinase activity of BCR/ABL as well as its E255K
and T315I mutants in in vitro kinase assays. These results
indicate that sorafenib induces apoptosis of BCR/ABL–
expressing cells, at least partly, by inhibiting BCR/ABL
to activate the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.
Thus, sorafenib may provide an effective therapeutic measure to treat Ph+ leukemias, particularly those expressing
the T315I mutant, which is totally resistant to imatinib
and the second generation BCR/ABL inhibitors. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The BCR/ABL fusion gene, generated by a reciprocal t(9;22)
chromosomal translocation causing the Philadelphia chromosome,
is the molecular signature of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
and is also observed in 30–40% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL; refs. 1, 2). Imatinib is a specific inhibitor of the BCR/ABL

tyrosine kinase and has shown unprecedented efficacy for the
treatment of these leukemias (1–4). However, the resistance to
imatinib may develop in significant portions of patients under
treatment, especially in those with CML in advanced stages or with
Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+) ALL, mostly due to the
emergence of mutations in the BCR/ABL kinase domain that may
inhibit binding of imatinib to the kinase domain, including the
most frequent E255K and T315I mutations (1–4). We previously
showed that BCR/ABL with either E255K or T315I also exhibited
the increase in activity to induce autophosphorylation and tyrosine
phosphorylation of various cellular proteins, including signal
transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5; refs. 5, 6).
Thus, it is possible that these mutations may confer the
growth advantage on leukemic cells to expand in the absence of
selective pressure from imatinib treatment. Therefore, studies
are urgently needed to develop new therapies to prevent or
counteract the imatinib resistance, particularly that with T315I
mutation, which confers complete resistance not only to imatinib
but also to the second generation BCR/ABL inhibitors nilotinib
and dasatinib (7).
Sorafenib (BAY43-9006) was originally developed as an orally
bioavailable small-molecule Raf kinase inhibitor (8). Sorafenib has
been approved by Food and Drug Administration for treatment of
renal cell carcinoma after a phase III clinical study in 2005. BCR/
ABL activates various intracellular signaling pathways, such as
those involving Ras, Raf-1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(Erk), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, STAT5, and nuclear factor-nB,
which normally play roles in regulation of hematopoiesis by
hematopoietic cytokines and other extracellular stimuli (1, 2). We
have recently shown that BCR/ABL also activates signaling
pathways involving Rap1 and B-Raf, which play important roles
in induction of cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis (9).
Thus, inhibitors for the Raf-1 and B-Raf kinases should be attractive
candidates for the development of novel therapies against the
imatinib resistance. Sorafenib also inhibits multiple tyrosine
kinases, including VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-a, Flt3, and c-Kit
(8). In accordance with this, recent studies have shown a significant
effect of sorafenib on acute myelogenous leukemia cells harboring
the constitutively activated Flt3 internal tandem duplication
mutations (10, 11). In addition, sorafenib has been reported to
induce apoptosis of a variety of hematopoietic tumor cells,
including those expressing BCR/ABL (12–15). Although the various
mechanisms have been reported, it has remained to be known
whether and how sorafenib specifically inhibits the BCR/ABL–
activated signaling events to affect proliferation and survival of
leukemic cells.
In this study, we show that sorafenib induces apoptosis of BCR/
ABL–driven cells, at least partly, through inhibition of the BCR/ABL
kinase activity. The present study further suggests that sorafenib

conformational change and caspase-3 cleavage, cells were fixed and
permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (Becton Dickinson) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Fixed cells were incubated with either
anti-Bax or anti–cleaved caspase-3 on ice for 40 min and then with
FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotech) or FITCconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Beckman Coulter), respectively, for
30 min in the dark. After washing, the samples were analyzed by flow
cytometry.
Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and in vitro kinase assays.
Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and in vitro kinase assays were
performed essentially as described previously (5, 9). In brief, BCR/ABL and
its mutants were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Abl and
reacted for 10 min at room temperature with 1 Ag of the glutathione
S-transferase (GST)–CrkL-F fusion protein (21) in the presence or absence
of 1 Amol/L cold ATP. To examine the inhibitory effects of sorafenib and
imatinib on BCR/ABL kinase activity, the inhibitor or 0.025% DMSO as
vehicle control was added to the reaction mixture on ice 15 min before
adding ATP and transferring to room temperature. The reaction products
were resolved by SDS–PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with
antiphosphotyrosine, followed by reprobing with anti-CrkL and anti-Abl.
Overexpression of Bcl-XL in Ton.B210 cells. A retroviral expression
plasmid for Bcl-XL, pMXs-puro-Bcl-XL, was constructed by subcloning the
EcoRI fragment coding for human Bcl-XL from pSFFV-neo-Bcl-XL into

pMXs-puro. PLAT-E cells were transfected with pMXs-puro-Bcl-XL or
pMXs-puro using the Lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies-Bethesda
Research Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The
recombinant retroviruses were harvested 48 h after transfection and used to
infect Ton.B210 cells. Infected cells were then selected in medium
containing 2 Ag/mL puromycin, and pools of infected cells were used for
subsequent experiments.
Statistical analysis. Values shown are means F SD of experiments
performed in triplicate and representative of at least three repeated
independent experiments. The statistical analysis was done using the
two-tailed Student’s t test and indicated as follows: *, P < 0.05; **, P <
0.01; ***, P < 0.001; NS, not significant (P > 0.05).

Results
Sorafenib induces apoptosis much more effectively in BCR/
ABL–driven cells than in IL-3–driven cells. We first examined
the effects of sorafenib on Ton.B210 cells, an IL-3–dependent cell
line that inducibly expresses BCR/ABL when cultured with
doxycycline (16). As shown in Fig. 1A, sorafenib at as low as
2.5 Amol/L significantly inhibited proliferation of BCR/ABL–driven
cells, whereas sorafenib at 5 Amol/L only moderately inhibited

(B) cultured with 10 ng/mL doxycycline to induce the BCR/ABL E255K or T315I mutant expression, respectively, in the absence of IL-3 or those cultured without
doxycycline in the presence of IL-3 were treated with indicated concentrations of sorafenib for 24 h and analyzed for cellular DNA content.

Figure 3. Sorafenib synergistically enhances rottlerin-induced, bortezomib-induced, or ABT-737–induced apoptosis of cells expressing BCR/ABL or its T315I mutant.
Ton.B210 cells expressing BCR/ABL (A) or its T315I mutant (B) were treated with or without 2.5 Amol/L (A) or 5 Amol/L (B ) sorafenib in the presence of 1 Amol/L
rottlerin, 2.5 ng/mL bortezomib, or 1 Amol/L ABT-737, as indicated, for 24 h and analyzed for apoptosis. Unless indicated otherwise, differences in values

were treated with indicated concentrations of sorafenib for 48 h and analyzed for the cellular DNA content. D, K562 cells were treated with or without 5 Amol/L sorafenib

values induced by sorafenib, rottlerin, or ABT-737 in the presence or absence of other reagents were statistically significant (P < 0.001).

Sorafenib-Induced Apoptosis in BCR/ABL–Expressing Cells

IL-3–dependent proliferation. Moreover, sorafenib at 2.5 or 7.5
Amol/L reduced viability of BCR/ABL–driven cells moderately or
drastically, respectively, whereas sorafenib at 7.5 Amol/L only
modestly reduced viability of IL-3–driven cells (Fig. 1B). In
accordance with this, treatment with sorafenib at as low as
2.5 Amol/L for 24 h induced apoptosis in Ton.B210 cells expressing
BCR/ABL as assessed by the fraction of cells with sub-G1 cellular
DNA content (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis was induced drastically in these
cells treated with 10 Amol/L sorafenib. On the other hand,
sorafenib at 10 Amol/L induced accumulation of IL-3–driven cells
in the G0-G1 phase but only modest apoptosis in these cells. Flow
cytometric analyses of cells stained with Annexin V-PI also showed
that apoptosis was induced significantly by 2.5 to 7.5 Amol/L
sorafenib specifically in BCR/ABL–driven Ton.B210 cells but not in
IL-3–driven cells (Fig. 1D).
Cells expressing the imatinib-resistant E255K or T315I BCR/
ABL mutant are also sensitive to sorafenib. We next examined
whether sorafenib can also induce apoptosis in Ton.B210/E255K
cells inducibly expressing BCR/ABL with the imatinib-resistant
E255K or T315I mutation in the kinase domain. As shown in Fig. 2,
sorafenib at 5.0 Amol/L or higher concentrations induced more
significant apoptosis in Ton.B210/E255K or Ton.B210/T315I cells
driven by the BCR/ABL mutant than in those driven by IL-3. These
cells driven by the E255K or T315I mutant were less sensitive than
Ton.B210 cells driven by BCR/ABL without any kinase domain
mutation, because sorafenib at 5 Amol/L induced apoptosis only
marginally in these cells. Nevertheless, these cells were sensitive to
sorafenib, much more significantly when driven by the BCR/ABL
mutants than by IL-3. These data indicate that, although more
resistant than cells expressing imatinib-sensitive BCR/ABL, cells
expressing the imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL mutants, including the
T315I mutant, are also sensitive to sorafenib.
Sorafenib synergistically enhances apoptosis induced by
rottlerin, bortezomib, or ABT-737 in BCR/ABL–expressing
cells. We next explored whether sorafenib may synergistically act
with other therapeutic agents to induce apoptosis in BCR/ABL–
expressing cells, because cells expressing the imatinib-resistant
BCR/ABL mutants were also relatively resistant to sorafenib at
5 Amol/L, which corresponds to the steady-state plasma concentration attainable in most patients continuously taking the standard
dose (400 mg bid) of sorafenib (22). As shown in Fig. 3A, rottlerin,
bortezomib, and ABT-737 at concentrations inducing apoptosis in
<10% of BCR/ABL–driven Ton.B210 cells when used alone induced
apoptosis in more than a third of cells in combination with
sorafenib at 2.5 Amol/L, which alone also failed to induce apoptosis
in >10% of cells. Sorafenib did not show any enhancing effect with
these agents in IL-3–driven Ton.B210 cells (data not shown). As
shown in Fig. 3B, apoptosis induced by rottlerin, bortezomib, or
ABT-737 in Ton.B210/T315I cells was also drastically enhanced by
sorafenib at 5 Amol/L, which failed to induce significant apoptosis
in these cells. Very similar effects were observed in Ton.B210/
E255K cells (data not shown).
We next examined the effects of sorafenib on several Ph+
leukemic cell lines. Sorafenib at 5 Amol/L induced significant
apoptosis in TMD-5 Ph+ ALL cells expressing the p190 form of
BCR/ABL, as well as in KU812 CML cells (Fig. 3C; data not
shown). On the other hand, sorafenib at 5 Amol/L barely
induced apoptosis in K562 or MOLM-1 cells (Fig. 3D; data not
shown). However, rottlerin and ABT-737, but not bortezomib,
significantly enhanced sorafenib-induced apoptosis in these
cells (Fig. 3D; data not shown). Thus, in various cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

expressing BCR/ABL we examined, apoptosis was significantly
induced by sorafenib at 5 Amol/L alone or in combination with
other agents, including ABT-737 and rottlerin, in synergistic
manners.
Sorafenib activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
leading to caspase activation specifically in BCR/ABL–
expressing cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms involved
in induction of apoptosis, we first examined whether activation of
caspases is involved. As shown in Fig. 4A, the pan-caspase inhibitor
BOC-d-fmk at least partly inhibited sorafenib-induced apoptosis
in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we examined the effect of
overexpression of the antiapoptotic Bcl2 family member Bcl-XL,
which has been shown to play an important role in inhibition of the
mitochondria-mediated induction of apoptosis in hematopoietic
cells (23). As shown in Fig. 4B, BCR/ABL–driven Ton.B210 cells
overexpressing Bcl-XL were remarkably more resistant to sorafenibinduced apoptosis compared with control cells cultured under the
same conditions. These data suggest that sorafenib may activate
the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway leading to
caspase activation to induce apoptosis in BCR/ABL–expressing cells.
To confirm this, we next examined the effects of sorafenib on
activation of Bax and caspase-3 as well as on Dw m in Ton.B210
cells driven by BCR/ABL or IL-3. Treatment of BCR/ABL–driven
Ton.B210 cells with 7.5 Amol/L sorafenib induced the activationspecific Bax conformational change, cleavage of caspase-3, and loss
of Dw m, which were observed significantly as early as 8 h after
treatment and increased thereafter in time course–dependent
manners (Fig. 5A; data not shown). BOC-d-fmk inhibited the
sorafenib-induced cleavage of caspase-3, the executioner caspaseactivated downstream in the caspase activation cascades (Fig. 5A).
However, BOC-d-fmk did not show any inhibitory effect on Bax
activation and loss of Dw m induced by sorafenib, thus indicating
that the activation of caspases takes place downstream of these
events. On the other hand, treatment of IL-3–driven Ton.B210
cells with sorafenib under the same conditions did not show any
significant effect on activation of Bax or caspase-3 and only
marginally affected Dw m (Fig. 5A). It was further observed that
overexpression of Bcl-XL significantly inhibited the effects of
sorafenib on activation of Bax and caspase-3 as well as on
depolarization of Dw m in BCR/ABL–driven Ton.B210 cells (Fig. 5B).
These data suggest that sorafenib activates caspases specifically in
BCR/ABL–driven cells through the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway, which is mediated by Bax activation and negatively regulated
by Bcl-XL, to induce apoptosis.
Sorafenib inhibits BCR/ABL, irrespective of imatinibresistance mutations and tyrosine phosphorylation of its
cellular substrates. We next investigated the effects of sorafenib
on signal transduction events regulating proliferation and apoptosis of cells expressing BCR/ABL. In accordance with previous
studies, sorafenib decreased phosphorylation of eIF4-E and induced phosphorylation of eIF2a in BCR/ABL–expressing Ton.B210
cells (Fig. 6A). However, these effects were observed in similar
manners also in IL-3-driven Ton.B210 cells. Sorafenib also inhibited
the activation-specific phosphorylation of Erk in similar manners
in both BCR/ABL–driven and IL-3–driven Ton.B210 cells (Fig. 6A).
These results suggest that these previously reported effects of
sorafenib may not play decisive roles in specific induction of
apoptosis in BCR/ABL–expressing cells.
We next examined the effects of sorafenib on tyrosine
phosphorylation of BCR/ABL and its downstream effector
molecules in Ton.B210 cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, sorafenib

BCR/ABL–expressing cells is inhibited by the
caspase inhibitor BOC-d-fmk or overexpression of
Bcl-XL. A , Ton.B210 cells expressing BCR/ABL
were left untreated for control or treated with
7.5 Amol/L sorafenib in the presence of indicated
concentrations of BOC-d-fmk for 24 h and analyzed
for the cellular DNA content. B, Ton.B210

inhibited the activation-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5
in BCR/ABL–driven, but not in IL-3–driven, Ton.B210 cells. Because
the STAT5 phosphorylation is mediated by BCR/ABL or Janusactivated kinase 2 (Jak2) in BCR/ABL–driven or IL-3–driven cells,
respectively, we speculated that sorafenib may inhibit BCR/ABL
but not Jak2. In accordance with this speculation, treatment of cells
with sorafenib and imatinib significantly reduced the tyrosine
phosphorylation of BCR/ABL and abrogated the activation-specific
tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 6B). Sorafenib and
imatinib also abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 and
significantly inhibited that of CrkL (Fig. 6B). Thus, both inhibitors
exhibited similar patterns of inhibition on tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR/ABL and its downstream effector molecules, although
the inhibitory effects of 10 Amol/L sorafenib were slightly less
significant than those of 1 Amol/L imatinib. Essentially, the same
results were obtained with a different cell line, 32Dcl3, expressing
BCR/ABL (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that sorafenib may inhibit
BCR/ABL and its downstream signaling events to induce apoptosis
specifically in BCR/ABL–expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 6B,
treatment of Ton.B210/T315I cells with 10 Amol/L sorafenib
moderately reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR/ABL and
CrkL and drastically inhibited that of STAT5 and Dok-1, whereas
1 Amol/L imatinib did not show any significant inhibitory effects in
these cells, as expected. Thus, the inhibitory effects of sorafenib
observed in Ton.B210/T315I cells were less significant than those
observed in Ton.B210 cells, which corresponds to the relative
resistance of Ton.B210/T315I cells to sorafenib for induction of

apoptosis and may be related to the increased activity of the BCR/
ABL mutant to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream
effector molecules, including STAT5 and Dok-1, and to increase the
expression level of Bcl-XL (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless, these results
suggest that sorafenib, but not imatinib, also inhibits BCR/ABL
with T315I and its downstream signaling events.
Finally, we examined the direct effect of sorafenib on BCR/ABL
by the in vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 6C, BCR/ABL
phosphorylated CrkL on tyrosine only in the presence of ATP.
Sorafenib added to the reaction mixture inhibited the CrkL
phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, with 5 Amol/L of
sorafenib showing an inhibitory effect comparable with that of
1 Amol/L imatinib. Sorafenib at 5 Amol/L also remarkably inhibited
the kinase activity of E255K mutant, which was inhibited to a lesser
degree by 1 Amol/L imatinib compared with naive BCR/ABL
without mutation (Fig. 6D). Sorafenib at 5 Amol/L strikingly
inhibited the kinase activity of T315I mutant, which was not at all
inhibited by 1 Amol/L imatinib, as expected (Fig. 6D). Together,
these results suggest that sorafenib directly inhibits the kinase
activity of BCR/ABL, which should contribute significantly to its
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects specifically observed in
BCR/ABL–expressing cells.

Discussion
Sorafenib has been reported to inhibit various tyrosine kinases in
addition to Raf kinases (8). However, its effect on the ABL or BCR/

ABL kinase has not been documented previously. Although we have
not performed detailed kinetic studies, sorafenib at 5 Amol/L
significantly inhibited the kinase activity of BCR/ABL in our in vitro
kinase assays, which was comparable with the effect of imatinib at
1 Amol/L (Fig. 6C). The specific inhibition of BCR/ABL–mediated,
but not IL-3–induced and Jak2-mediated, tyrosine phosphorylation

of STAT5 in sorafenib-treated cells (Fig. 6A) further supports the
notion that sorafenib directly inhibits the BCR/ABL kinase
activity. However, the inhibition of BCR/ABL–mediated tyrosine
phosphorylation of various cellular substrates in Ton.B210
induced by 10 Amol/L sorafenib was slightly less than that
induced by 1 Amol/L imatinib (Fig. 6B; data not shown), which

Figure 6. Sorafenib inhibits BCR/ABL kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of its cellular substrates. A, Ton.B210 cells expressing BCR/ABL or cultured without
doxycycline in the presence of IL-3 were treated with or without 10 Amol/L sorafenib for indicated times. Cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis
with anti–phosphorylated eIF4E (eIF4E-P ) antibody, followed by sequential reprobing with anti–phosphorylated eIF2a (eIF2a-P), anti–phosphorylated Erk (Erk-P ),
anti-Erk (Erk ), anti–phosphorylated STAT5 (STAT5-P ), and anti–STAT5 (STAT5 ) antibodies, as indicated. B, Ton.B210 (WT ), Ton.B210/T315I (T315I ), or 32Dcl3
expressing BCR/ABL (Ton.32D210 ) were cultured for 2 h with or without 1 Amol/L imatinib or 10 Amol/L sorafenib, as indicated, before harvest. Cell lysates were
subjected to Western blot analysis with antiphosphotyrosine (PY), anti-ABL (ABL ), anti–phosphorylated STAT5 (STAT5-P) , anti-STAT5 (STAT5 ), anti-Bcl-XL (Bcl-XL ),
and anti–h-actin (b-actin ) antibodies, as indicated. Cell lysates were also subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Dok-1 or CrkL (right ) and
analyzed by Western blot analysis with antiphosphotyrosine (PY) and the relevant antibodies (left). The horizontal bar indicates the positions of BCR/ABL. C, BCR/ABL
was immunoprecipitated with anti-ABL antibody from Ton.B210 cells and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using the GST–CrkL-F fusion protein as substrate in
the presence of cold ATP unless indicated otherwise. The kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of indicated concentrations of sorafenib, imatinib, or the
vehicle (DMSO ), as well as in their absence as control (Cont. ). The reaction mixtures were subjected to Western blot analysis with antiphosphotyrosine (PY), followed
by reprobing with anti-CrkL and anti-ABL. The asterisk and horizontal bar indicate the positions of GST–CrkL-F and BCR/ABL, respectively. D, BCR/ABL without
mutation and with the E255K or T315I mutation, as indicated, was immunoprecipitated from Ton.B210/E255K and Ton.B210/T315I cells, respectively, and subjected
to the in vitro kinase assays as in C in the absence or presence of 5 Amol/L sorafenib and 1 Amol/L imatinib, as indicated.

suggests that sorafenib may not penetrate into cells as efficiently
as imatinib. Nevertheless, the present study strongly suggests that
sorafenib at V10 Amol/L partially, but directly, inhibits BCR/ABL
kinase activity in cells.
Previous studies have shown that sorafenib inhibited proliferation and survival of a variety of cell types, including leukemic
cells, through various mechanisms, such as inhibition of the Raf/
MEK/Erk signaling pathway, down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression,
and induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (8, 12–15, 24).
In accordance with these reports (12, 14), we observed that
sorafenib not only inhibited activation-specific phosphorylation of
Erk but also induced phosphorylation of eIF2a and dephosphorylation of eIF4E, which are involved in endoplasmic reticulum
stress signaling and Mcl-1 down-regulation, respectively (Fig. 6A).
However, these effects of sorafenib were observed in similar
manners in both BCR/ABL–driven and IL-3–driven cells and,
thus, should not play decisive roles in activation of the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which was observed specifically
in BCR/ABL–driven cells. On the other hand, sorafenib specifically
inhibited BCR/ABL–dependent phosphorylation of various cellular
substrates and directly inhibited the kinase activity of BCR/ABL
in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 6). Therefore, the present study
strongly suggests that inhibition of the BCR/ABL kinase activity
by sorafenib should play an essential role in the induction of
apoptosis in BCR/ABL–driven cells. As compared with imatinib,
however, sorafenib less efficiently and only moderately inhibited
the BCR/ABL kinase activity while inducing significant apoptosis
in these cells. It is thus speculated that the inhibition of BCR/ABL
by sorafenib may act cooperatively with other BCR/ABL–
independent effects of sorafenib, including those discussed above,
to induce apoptosis effectively in BCR/ABL–driven cells.
Very recently, Rahmani and colleagues (15) reported that
sorafenib inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in BCR/
ABL–expressing cells, including BaF3 cells expressing BCR/ABL

Sorafenib-Induced Apoptosis in BCR/ABL–Expressing Cells

with or without E255K and T315I mutations. The authors,
however, concluded that it is not through inhibition of BCR/ABL,
because the tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL, as examined by
the phosphorylated CrkL-specific antibody, was not affected by
sorafenib treatment in K562 cells. We also observed that the
tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was very efficiently inhibited
by sorafenib (Fig. 6). However, sorafenib did not show any
significant inhibitory effect on the STAT5 phosphorylation
mediated by Jak2 in IL-3–driven cells (Fig. 6A). Furthermore,
although the inhibitory effect of sorafenib on the tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT5 was more remarkable than that of
BCR/ABL in the two cell lines we examined, imatinib similarly
inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation more efficiently than that of
BCR/ABL (Fig. 6B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of other substrates
of BCR/ABL was also affected to different extents by sorafenib
with that of CrkL inhibited much less significantly than that of
Dok-1 (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless, the inhibitory effects of sorafenib
on tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates correlated with
those of imatinib in the two cell lines we examined. Thus, it is
speculated that the differences in sensitivity of inhibition of
tyrosine phosphorylation may reflect the differences in threshold
of the BCR/ABL kinase activity required for phosphorylation or
the differences in sensitivity to tyrosine phosphatases. It should
also be noted that the differences in experimental methods might
have been partially responsible for the apparent discordance with
the results reported by Rahmani and colleagues (22), because the
anti–phosphorylated CrkL antibody has not worked reliably in our
hands given an apparently high background signal (data not
shown).
In accordance with previous studies, induction of significant
apoptosis in some of the BCR/ABL–expressing cells required up
to 10 Amol/L of sorafenib. Although the exact mechanisms
causing relative resistance remain to be known, the strength of
BCR/ABL signaling and antiapoptotic potentials of cells may be,
at least in part, responsible for the differences in sensitivity to
sorafenib. It is notable in this regard that, compared with
Ton.B210 cells, Ton.B210/E255K or Ton.B210/T315I cells
exhibited an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of various
BCR/ABL substrates, including STAT5, in accordance with our
previous reports (5, 6), and in expression level of Bcl-XL, which
is dependent on STAT5 activation in BCR/ABL–expressing cells
(ref. 25; Fig. 6B; data not shown). In spite of the findings that
some of the BCR/ABL–expressing cells were resistant to
sorafenib at the trough plasma concentration expected from
the clinical studies (22), the present study has shown that lower
concentrations of sorafenib could induce significant apoptosis in
synergistic manners in combination with subtoxic concentrations
of bortezomib, ABT-737, and rottlerin (Fig. 3). These results also
agree with previously reported results in various types of tumor
cells, including leukemic cells, showing the synergistic effects of
sorafenib with these reagents (24, 26, 27). In addition, sorafenib
has been reported to exhibit synergistic effects with various
other therapeutic agents, including AraC, adaphostin, and
vorinostat, which act through a variety of different molecular
mechanisms (13, 24, 28). Nevertheless, the mechanisms for the
synergistic effects have remained to be defined. The Bcl2 family
antagonist ABT-737 most likely enhances the effect of sorafenib
by inhibiting Bcl-XL, which is supported by the observation that
ABT-737 sensitized Ton.B210/T315I cells highly expressing Bcl-XL
to sorafenib at 5 Amol/L, which alone is insufficient to induce
significant apoptosis (Figs. 2B and 3B). Previously, Jane and

www.aacrjournals.org

colleagues (26) speculated that rottlerin enhanced the effect of
sorafenib through inhibition of PKCy and its downstream
signaling pathways in glioma cell lines. However, our previous
study revealed that rottlerin failed to inhibit PKCy in Ton.B210
cells but uncoupled mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to
enhance imatinib-induced apoptosis (6). Because sorafenib also
inhibits BCR/ABL in common with imatinib, it is speculated that
rottlerin synergistically enhances sorafenib-induced apoptosis
also through the mitochondrial uncoupling effect. It was
previously suggested that bortezomib synergistically enhanced
sorafenib-induced apoptosis, at least partly, through synergistic
activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in various tumor
cells (27). In Ton.B210 cells, however, sorafenib did not enhance
activation of JNK but inhibited that of p38,3 most likely by
directly inhibiting its kinase activity (8). Because inhibition of
p38 reportedly augments bortezomib-induced apoptosis, it is
possible that sorafenib synergistically enhances the effect of
bortezomib through this mechanisms (29). Future studies are
warranted to explore the possible synergistic combination of
sorafenib with various therapeutic agents and to define the
molecular mechanisms involved in synergism.
Importantly, the present study has shown that sorafenib
induces apoptosis of cells expressing BCR/ABL harboring the
T315I mutation in the ‘‘gatekeeper region’’ (7). This result is in
fact in agreement with the very recent report by Rahmani and
colleagues (15), in which the authors showed that sorafenib was
effective against cells expressing BCR/ABL with E255K, M351T,
and T315I mutation. We have further shown that sorafenib
directly and similarly inhibited the kinase activity of BCR/ABL
with or without the gate keeper mutation T315I. In this regard, it
is noteworthy that previous reports have shown that sorafenib
inhibited various oncogenic tyrosine kinases with imatinibresistant gatekeeper mutants similar to the BCR/ABL T315I
mutant (30–32). Together with its proven clinical safety and its
synergistic effects with various therapeutic agents, sorafenib, with
its efficacy against the most troublesome T315I mutation, may
prove to be very valuable for development of the effective
molecular targeted therapy against Ph1+ leukemia with the T315I
mutant resistant to imatinib as well as to the second generation
BCR/ABL inhibitors, which needs to be tested in future clinical
trials.
