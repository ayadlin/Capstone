Abstract

Introduction

The monoclonal antibodies (moAb) panitumumab and cetuximab target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
and have proven valuable for the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC). EGFR-mediated signaling involves
two main intracellular cascades: on one side KRAS activates
BRAF, which in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinases. On the other, membrane localization of the lipid
kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis.
Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding
signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC
bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy
with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that
mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism.
Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS
and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of
110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs. We
observed 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations.
PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with clinical
resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab; none of the
mutated patients achieved objective response (P = 0.038).
When only KRAS wild-type tumors were analyzed, the
statistical correlation was stronger (P = 0.016). Patients with
PIK3CA mutations displayed a worse clinical outcome also in
terms of progression-free survival (P = 0.035). Our data
indicate that PIK3CA mutations can independently hamper
the therapeutic response to panitumumab or cetuximab in
mCRC. When the molecular status of the PIK3CA/PTEN and
KRAS pathways are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70%
of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to EGFR moAbs can
be identified. [Cancer Res 2009;69(5):1851–7]

Despite the introduction of new treatments, the 5-year survival
rate for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains below 10%
(1). Additional active agents, as well as further insights about the
mechanisms of resistance to current therapeutics, are needed to
improve clinical outcome. Treatment options for mCRC nowadays
include the chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody (moAb) cetuximab
and the fully humanized IgG2 moAb panitumumab (2, 3).
Both molecules bind to the extracellular domain of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), leading to inhibition of its downstream signaling, and providing a meaningful clinical benefit.
However, this is limited to <20% of patients (3–5). Others and we
have previously shown that KRAS mutations (that affect signaling
downstream of the EGFR) can independently impair the efficacy of
anticancer therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab (6–8). The
majority of patients with mCRC resistant to anti-EGFR moAbs
have tumors with activating mutations of KRAS. However, only a
fraction of those with wild-type KRAS tumors, although larger than
in the unselected population (8–10), respond to treatment, thus
suggesting a role for additional mechanisms of resistance.
The PIK3CA gene is mutated in f20% of CRCs (11). PIK3CA
mutations occurring in the ‘‘hotspots’’ located in exon 9 (E542K,
E545K) and exon 20 (H1047R) are oncogenic in CRC cellular models
(12). The PIK3CA gene encodes for a lipid kinase that regulates,
alongside with KRAS, signaling pathways downstream of the EGFR.
Moreover, the p110a subunit of PI3K, encoded by PIK3CA, can be
activated by interaction with RAS proteins (13). PI3K-initiated
signaling is normally inhibited by phosphatase and tensin
homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN). In breast cancer
patients, PTEN protein loss, evaluated by immunohistochemistry
(14) or by the signature gene stathmin (15), predicts poor prognosis
(15) and resistance to the anti-HER2 moAb trastuzumab (14). In
CRC, we have previously reported that loss of PTEN expression,
which occurs in 30% of sporadic cases, may be associated with lack
of response to cetuximab (16). Whether and to what extent the
occurrence of PIK3CA mutations affects responsiveness of mCRC
patients to anti EGFR moAbs is presently unknown.
Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS
alongside with the evaluation of PTEN expression in a cohort of 110
mCRC-treated patients, to clarify how these genes affect clinical
response to anti-EGFR–targeted therapies.

or at the Institute of Pathology (Locarno, Switzerland). Patients gave
informed consent and were treated with panitumumab- or cetuximabbased regimens at Ospedale Niguarda Ca’ Granda (Milan, Italy) or at the
Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland (Bellinzona, Switzerland). All
patients had EGFR expression in their tumor specimens in z1% malignant
cells assessed by immunohistochemistry with the Dako EGFR PharmDx kit

(DakoCytomation). Patients evaluated in this study were selected based on
evidence that treatment outcome could be attributable only to administration of either panitumumab or cetuximab. Patients’ clinical characteristics and number of previous lines of therapy administered are reported in
Table 1. With the exception of 13 patients who received cetuximab as
frontline therapy, the others had failed at least one prior chemotherapy
regimen. Overall, 22 (20%) received panitumumab monotherapy, 14 (13%)
patients received cetuximab monotherapy, and 74 (67%) received cetuximab
plus irinotecan-based chemotherapy. For those patients who progressed on
irinotecan-based chemotherapy, cetuximab was administered in combination with irinotecan given at the same dose and schedule previously used.
Treatment was continued until progressive disease (PD) or toxicity
occurred, according to the standard criteria (17).
Clinical evaluation and tumor response criteria. Clinical response
was assessed every 6 to 8 wk with radiological examination (computerized
tomodensitometry or magnetic resonance imaging). The Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; ref. 17) were adopted for
evaluation and objective tumor response was classified into partial response
(PR), stable disease (SD), and PD. Patients with SD or PD were defined as
nonresponders. Response to therapy was also evaluated retrospectively by
independent radiologists.
Molecular analyses. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor blocks
were reviewed for quality and tumor content. A single representative block,
from either the primary tumor or the liver metastasis, depending on
availability, containing at least 70% of neoplastic cells, was selected for each
case. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp Mini kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PTEN expression. PTEN protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on 3-Am formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections as
previously reported (16, 18) with some modifications. Briefly, anti-PTEN
Ab4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 1:200 dilution and PTEN Ab2
(Neomarkers) with 1:50 dilution were used at the Niguarda Hospital and
at the Institute of Pathology of Locarno, respectively. PTEN protein
expression was mainly detected at cytoplasmic level and very few cases also
showed nuclear positivity. Tumors were considered negative, i.e., with loss
of PTEN, when absence or reduction of immunostaining was seen in >50%
of cells compared with internal controls (i.e., vascular endothelial cells and
nerves; Supplementary Fig. S1 shows PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative
representative cases). Healthy tissue, i.e., normal colon mucosa, was used

as internal positive control; normal endometrium was used as external
positive control. The evaluations were performed without knowledge of
clinical data or results of molecular analyses.
Mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS in tumor samples. We
searched for PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20, and for KRAS mutations
in exon 2. PIK3CA exon 9 includes codons 542 and 545, PIK3CA exon 20
codon 1047, and KRAS exon 2 codons 12 and 13, where the large majority of
mutations occur in these genes (19). The list of primers used for mutational
analysis is available from the authors upon request. All samples were
subjected to automated sequencing by ABI PRISM 3730 (Applied
Biosystems). All mutated cases were confirmed twice, starting from
independent PCR reactions. In one instance (patient 55), the results from
the first analysis showed a mutation in PIK3CA (E545A) that was not
confirmed when the PCR/sequence was independently repeated. It is
possible that the corresponding tumor was heterogeneous and only a
fraction of the cancer cells contained the mutation.
Statistical analyses. All collected data were descriptively analyzed with
the statistical methods, after checking their distributions by means of the
Shapiro-Wilk test. Cross-tabulations with qualitative variables were
analyzed with the Fisher’s exact, whereas comparisons between continuous
variables were carried out with Student’s t or Mann-Whitney U tests. The
general linear model with logit link function and standard or exact
algorithm was used to assess univariate and multivariate models having
binary end point; the choice among best fitting models was done using the
Bayesian Information Criterion according to Schwartz. The survival
analysis was done with the Kaplan-Meier survivor function followed by
logrank test; the Cox semiparametric method was used for multivariate
regression survival analysis; proportional hazard assumption was checked
using the Schoenfeld residuals. Statistical significance was assumed for a
P value of <0.05. All statistical evaluations were done with Stata/SE 10.0
(the StataCorpl).

Results
Frequency of mutations in PIK3CA and KRAS, and loss of
PTEN protein expression. Mutational profiling of 110 colorectal
tumors from patients treated with anti-EGFR moAbs led to the
identification of 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations. As expected, PIK3CA mutations were found both in exon 9
(4 cases) and in exon 20 (11 cases). Similarly, KRAS was mutated
at codon 12 in 23 cases (71.9%), and at codon 13 in 8 cases (25.0%);
a double point mutation involving both codons was detected in
1 case (3.1%). Concomitant PIK3CA and KRAS mutations were
observed in two samples. PTEN protein assessment was performed
by immunohistochemistry analysis. Among the 81 evaluated tumor
specimens, 32 (39.5%) showed loss of PTEN protein. Results of
mutational analyses and immunohistochemistry are shown in
Supplementary Table S1.
Clinical and pathologic characteristics according to mutations in PIK3CA or KRAS and loss of PTEN protein expression.
Analyses of the association between mutational status of PIK3CA
and KRAS and PTEN expression with clinical-pathologic characteristics are shown in Table 2. No association was found between
these variables and age, location of the primary tumor (i.e., colon,
sigma-rectum junction, or rectum), or degree of cutaneous toxicity.
Mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, and PTEN loss are associated
with lack of objective response to panitumumab or cetuximab.
The relationship between PIK3CA mutations, KRAS mutations, and
PTEN expression with clinical outcome was evaluated in terms of
objective tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and
overall survival (OS).

In univariate analysis, PIK3CA mutations were significantly
associated with lack of response to panitumumab or cetuximab,
with none of the mutated patients achieving objective tumor
response (P = 0.038). The same negative association was observed
for KRAS mutations (9.1% of mutations among responders versus
34.5% among non responders; P = 0.019) and was confirmed
when at least a mutation of either KRAS or PIK3CA was considered (P = 0.001; Table 3A). When only KRAS wild-type tumors

were analyzed, the statistical association between PIK3CA mutations with lack of response to panitumumab or cetuximab was
confirmed (P = 0.016). In bivariate analysis, PIK3CA mutations and
KRAS mutations were simultaneously significant (P = 0.0234 and
0.0125, respectively); in multivariate logistic regression, an independent effect of PIK3CA mutations, KRAS mutations, and PTEN
protein expression was also confirmed (P = 0.0337, 0.0029, and
0.0012, respectively; Table 3B). Our data indicate that similarly to

KRAS, PIK3CA wild-type status represents a necessary but not
sufficient condition to reach objective response. Assessment of
PIK3CA mutations therefore represents an independent factor
to predict clinical outcome among KRAS wild-type patients.
PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss are negatively associated
with survival in mCRCs patients treated with panitumumab or
cetuximab. Analysis of survival showed that patients with tumors

harboring PIK3CA mutations had a worse clinical outcome in
terms of PFS, compared with wild-type tumors (P = 0.0035;

decreased PFS (P = 0.0815; Fig. 1B). Shorter PFS was also detected
in patients harboring at least a mutation of either KRAS or PIK3CA
(P = 0.0032; Fig. 1C). PTEN loss was similarly associated with
shorter PFS (P = 0.0681) that reached statistical significance if

this variable was combined with PIK3CA mutations (loss of PTEN
and/or PIK3CA mutation; P = 0.0066; Fig. 1D–E). Accordingly,
Cox multivariate survival analysis confirmed that patients with
at least one alteration of either PIK3CA or PTEN had a higher
risk of progression (P = 0.009), whereas the model was not
significant for KRAS mutations (P = 0.128; Table 3C). Among
KRAS wild-type only patients, a decreased PFS was confirmed for
patients with PIK3CA mutations in their tumors (P = 0.0021;
Fig. 1F).
Neither PIK3CA mutations nor KRAS mutations were associated
with OS (P = 0.2516 and 0.1127, respectively; Fig. 2A–B), although a
trend toward decreased OS was evident in patients harboring at
least a mutation of either KRAS or PIK3CA (P = 0.0645; Fig. 2C).
PTEN loss of expression was significantly associated with worse OS
(P = 0.0048), as was the combination of PTEN loss with PIK3CA
mutations (P = 0.0161; Fig. 2D–E). In KRAS wild-type tumors,
PIK3CA mutations did not influence OS (P = 0.2921; Fig. 2F).

Discussion

moAbs panitumumab or cetuximab (6–8). This notion has been
acknowledged by European Medicines Agency (EMEA) that
approved the use of panitumumab or cetuximab only in mCRC
patients whose tumors display wild-type KRAS.8,9 KRAS mutations,
however, only account for 30% to 40% of nonresponsive patients.
The identification of additional genetic determinants of resistance
to EGFR-targeted therapies in CRC is therefore clearly a priority.
We noted that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases
cascade triggered by the KRAS/BRAF pathway represents only
one side of the axis on which the EGFR relies for propagation of its
mitogenic stimulus. On the other side, membrane localization of
the lipid kinase PIK3CA promotes AKT1 activation, ensuing to a
parallel intracellular propagation of the signal. We hypothesized
that, similarly to what observed for the oncogenic activation of the
KRAS/MAPK pathway, the constitutive deregulation of the PIK3CA
gene could bypass the EGFR-initiated signaling cascade. To test
this possibility, we assessed whether tumors bearing PIK3CA
mutations were resistant to EGFR-targeted therapy with moAbs.
Our results indicate that PIK3CA mutations could be considered
alongside with those affecting KRAS as predictors of primary
resistance to EGFR moAbs therapies. PIK3CA mutations explain
lack of objective response in additional 17% of KRAS wild-type
patients. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis of KRAS and
PIK3CA mutations showed that both alterations play an independent and significant role in predicting resistance (Table 3A).
Patients with PIK3CA-mutated mCRC had worse clinical outcome
in terms of PFS, and this was confirmed also for KRAS wild-type
tumors (Fig. 1A and F). In addition, we show, for the first time, that
loss of PTEN is associated not only with lack of objective tumor
response as previously reported (16) but also with worse OS in
patients with mCRC treated with panitumumab or cetuximab.
Overall, our data indicate that a comprehensive analysis of both the
KRAS/BRAF and PI3K pathways including KRAS and PIK3CA
mutation and PTEN protein status is significantly associated with
both PFS and OS, thus representing the best predictor of clinical
outcome in this setting. Among the subgroup of 59 evaluable KRAS
wild-type patients, this combined analysis could indeed identify
an additional 44% of nonresponsive cases (Fig. 3). Thus, the combination of KRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN analyses could lead to the
identification of 70% of mCRC patients resistant to panitumumab
or cetuximab.
With regard to the role of PIK3CA mutations in affecting tumor
progression, a number of functional evidences suggest that PIK3CA
mutations might have a relatively mild effect on the growth of
the tumor (12). One possibility is that tumors carrying PIK3CA
mutations may be less aggressive than those that do not and,
hence, have better PFS. However, in the present study in patients
with metastatic disease and particularly dismal prognosis, those
carrying PIK3CA mutations have worse clinical outcome, therefore
not supporting this hypothesis. In vitro studies have recently shown
that PIK3CA mutation/PTEN expression status predicts response
of colon cancer cell lines to cetuximab (20), thus supporting our
observations on clinical samples.
The decision of health authorities (EMEA) to restrict the clinical
use of panitumumab or cetuximab for patients with wild-type
KRAS mCRC8,9 is expected to ameliorate the therapeutic index of
these targeted agents. Nevertheless, in the KRAS wild-type

Our work, as well as that of other laboratories, has shown
that almost all mCRC patients with tumors harboring KRAS
mutations are resistant to treatment with the EGFR-targeted

PIK3CA and Response to Panitumumab or Cetuximab

population of mCRC, the objective response rate is limited to 17%
(versus 0% in KRAS mutated) for panitumumab monotherapy (8)
and to 59% to 61% (versus 43–33%) for cetuximab plus either
irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, respectively (9, 10).
Once validated in prospective trials, the finding that deregulation
of the PI3K pathway identifies mCRC patients with clinical
resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab could find immediate
clinical applications.
