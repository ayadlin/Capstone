ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance remains a major clinical problem in combating human lung
adenocarcinoma (LAD), and abnormal autophagy is closely associated with this
phenomenon. In the present study, an inverse correlation between miR-200b and
autophagy-associated gene 12 (ATG12) expressions was observed in docetaxelresistant (SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX) and sensitive (SPC-A1 and H1299) LAD cells as
well as in tissue samples. Further study showed that miR-200b directly targeted ATG12
in LAD. Moreover, miR-200b-dependent ATG12 downregulation inhibited autophagy
and enhanced the chemosensitivity of SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX cells both in vivo
and in vitro. LAD chemoresistance is therefore closely related to downregulation of
miR-200b and the corresponding upregulation of ATG12. These results provide new
evidence for the mechanisms governing the microRNA (miRNA)-ATG12 network and
their possible contribution to autophagy modulation and LAD chemoresistance.

of several protein complexes (consisting of a number of
conserved autophagy-related proteins), double-membrane
vesicles called autophagosome are produced that transport
cytoplasmic components into lysosomes for degradation
[6, 7]. Among autophagy-related proteins, there are two
classes of ubiquitin-like proteins: the autophagy-related
MAP1LC3 (LC3) family (which consists of seven
members in mammals) and ATG12, which share some
sequence similarities [8]. LC3 and ATG12 are activated
by the same E1-like enzyme ATG7, and subsequently
transferred to the E2-like enzymes, ATG3 and ATG10,
respectively. ATG3 conjugates ATG8 to the membrane
lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at autophagosomeforming sites, where this conjugate recruits cytoplasmic
cargo and assists expansion of the isolation membrane [9].
However, ATG10 attaches ATG12 to another structural
protein, ATG5, which results in the eventual formation
of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex. This complex acts
as an E3-like enzyme to facilitate ATG8-PE formation
[10]. Indeed, cells lacking any of the conjugation reaction
components exhibit autophagy defects.
Although certain studies regard autophagy
as an alternative form of stress-induced cell death,
overwhelming evidence supports the idea that autophagy

INTRODUCTION
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for
approximately 80% of all lung cancers and is the leading
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1, 2]. NSCLC
is the most common histological type of LAD. Current
standard treatments for LAD include surgical resection,
platinum-based chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a
combination of these methods. Unfortunately, LAD
has a poor prognosis and rapidly develops resistance to
antineoplastic drugs both in vivo and in vitro [3]. Patients
with resistant disease, especially at an advanced stage,
suffer early relapse with an overall 5 year survival rate of
only 15% [2]. Identifying the underlying mechanisms of
LAD chemoresistance is therefore of major importance in
the clinical application of chemotherapy.
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process
responsible for intracellular degradation of long-lived
proteins and organelles [4]. Autophagy is rapidly
activated in response to intracellular (e.g. accumulation
of unfolded proteins, damaged or surplus organelles,
pathogens) and extracellular (e.g. starvation, hypoxia)
stress factors and provides recycled metabolic substrates
necessary for survival [5]. Through the concerted action

functions primarily as a pro-survival mechanism, which
leads to chemoresistance [11]. We previously reported
that LAD cells use autophagy to evade antitumor drugs;
mechanistic investigation revealed that HMGB1 triggers
autophagy by promoting Beclin-1-PI3K-III core complex
formation through activation of the MEK/ERK1/2
signaling pathway [12]. Nevertheless, despite advances
in our understanding of the process of autophagy, the
mechanisms regulating this multi-stage process remain
largely unknown. Considering the importance of both
miRNAs and autophagy in cancer-related processes
[13], and given the lack of strong evidence linking these
two rapidly growing fields of research in LAD, here we
investigate the role of miRNAs in autophagy.
MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression by base
paring with specific mRNA target sequences (mainly
3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR)), which leads to
translational inhibition or mRNA degradation [14].
A growing number of miRNAs reportedly regulate the
expression of ATG genes, or their regulators, at different
autophagy steps [15]. However, the mechanism whereby
dysregulated miRNAs affect autophagic activity in
chemoresistant NSCLC cells remains poorly understood.
Herein, we report that miR-200b, a down-regulated
miRNA in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, remarkably
inhibits autophagy activation and enhances sensitivity
to multiple antitumor drugs. Specifically, we report
for the first time that ATG12 is a direct target of miR200b in LAD. We demonstrate miR-200b-dependent
downregulation of ATG12, which blocks autophagy and
resensitized LAD cells to chemotherapy both in vivo and
in vitro. Our study confirms the importance of miRNAs in
autophagy control and provides the first evidence for miR200b-dependent regulation of autophagy.

consistent with our previously reported microarray results,
confirming their validity (Supplementary Fig. 1A). We
hypothesized that these dysregulated miRNAs contribute
to increased autophagy in SPC-A1/DTX cells. To test our
hypothesis, we transfected sequence-specific inhibitors
of upregulated miRNAs or precursors of downregulated
miRNAs into SPC-A1/DTX cells and then detected the
incidence of autophagy; an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio
was considered evidence for autophagy induction [17].
Western blot analysis demonstrated that, compared with a
nonspecific mimic or inhibitor-negative control, the miR200b mimic (PmiR-200b) exhibited maximum inhibitory
potency against autophagy activity, as demonstrated by
the significant decrease in the conversion of LC3-I to
LC3-II (Fig. 1A). We therefore selected miR-200b to
further explore the influence of miRNAs on autophagy.
SPC-A1/DTX cells with a relatively higher
LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were transfected with PmiR-200b
to upregulate miR-200b expression. Ectopic miR-200b
attenuated the conversion of LC3-II to LC3-I and
prevented P62 degradation with or without treatment with
docetaxel or cisplatin (Fig. 1B). Additionally miR-200bdependent inhibition of autophagy was confirmed by GFPLC3 fluorescence microscopy, where the percentage of
punctate GFP+ SPC-A1/DTX cells was reduced (Fig. 1C).
In contrast, suppressing miR-200b (by transfecting a
miR-200b inhibitor (AmiR-200b) into SPC-A1 cells)
resulted in elevated turnover of LC3-II and increased the
percentage of punctate GFP-positive cells (Fig. 1B, 1C).
The formation of characteristic autophagosomes further
confirmed the increased autophagic activity, as observed
by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1D).
Diminished LC3-II levels can be caused by
blocking autophagosome formation or by excessive
clearance of autophagosomes. To distinguish between
these two possibilities, Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), which
blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion, was employed
to prevent LC3-II degradation [18]. Following docetaxel
treatment, LC3-II accumulation was further enhanced in
Baf A1-pretreated control SPC-A1/DTX cells, but only
minimally altered in miR-200b-transfected cells (Fig. 1E).
Conversely, LC3-II accumulation was not affected by Baf
A1 when administering AmiR-200b, suggesting that the
increased in LC3-II was caused by autophagy induction
as opposed to inhibition of autophagosome clearance
mediated by miR-200b (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, blocking
autophagy with ATG5 siRNA abolished AmiR-200bdependent formation of LC3-II (Fig. 1F).
To extend our findings, we prepared another
docetaxel-resistant LAD cell line, H1299/DTX, from
docetaxel-sensitive H1299 cells in vitro. H1299/DTX
cells exhibited a 2.81-fold downregulation in miR200b expression compared with parental H1299 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). Similar to the results in
SPC-A1/DTX cells, forced expression of miR-200b
limited autophagy activity in H1299/DTX cells even when

RESULTS
Forced expression of miR-200b blocks
autophagy in LAD cells
We previously demonstrated that autophagy
acts as a resistance mechanism in docetaxel-resistant
SPC-A1/DTX cells and that suppression of high-mobility
group box 1 (HMGB1) or limiting HMGB1 cytosolic
translocation alleviated autophagic protection in response
to docetaxel [12]. Here we were interested to explore the
role of miRNAs in the development of autophagy-related
docetaxel resistance in LAD cells.
Using microarrays, we previously showed that
6 of 52 miRNAs were differentially expressed more
than two fold in docetaxel-resistant SPC-A1/DTX cells
compared with parental SPC-A1 cells, including three
upregulated miRNAs (miR-192, miR-424 and miR-98)
and three downregulated miRNAs (miR-200b, miR-194
and miR-212) [16]. The qRT-PCR data reported here was

treated with cytotoxic agents, as shown by diminished
LC3-II/LC3-I ratios and the reduction in punctate GFPpositive cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A, 2B). By contrast,
miR-200b silencing led to the activation of autophagy,
which was further enhanced when exposed to antitumor
drugs (Supplementary Fig. 2A, 2B). Meanwhile, AmiR200b transfection into H1299 cells resulted in LC3-II
accumulation, whereas Baf A1 pretreatment failed to
further increase LC3-II accumulation (Supplementary
Fig. 2C). Collectively, these data indicate that miR-200b
negatively regulates autophagy in LAD cells.

cells to nutrient starvation (using Hank’s balanced
salt solution), caused a decrease in endogenous miR200b expression after 1 hour, and a delayed response in
increased ATG12 mRNA expression, which returned
to near basal levels about 4 hours after the addition of
exogenous miR-200b to SPC-A1 cells (Fig. 3A). Similar
results were obtained in H1299 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 4A). Enhanced ATG12 expression corresponded
with decreased miR-200b expression, implying that an
early decrease in miR-200b expression may regulate
the magnitude of ATG12 gene expression. Consistently,
overexpressing miR-200b or a specific siRNA that targets
ATG12 inhibited starvation-induced conversion of LC3-I
to LC3-II, prevented p62 degradation and reduced the
number of punctate GFP-positive cells (Fig. 3B, 3C and
Supplementary Fig. 4B, 4C).
We next examined the effect of miR-200b on
autophagy induced by another stimulus, the mTOR blocker
rapamycin [19]. Suppression of mTOR activity activates
the Ulk1/2 complex, an early event during autophagy,
although mTOR-independent pathways also exist [20].
In line with the starvation data, addition of rapamycin
accelerated GFP-LC3 punctate formation, LC3-II turnover
as well as p62 clearance, but these results were attenuated
after transfection with either PmiR-200b or Atg12
siRNA (Fig. 3D, 3E and Supplementary  Fig.  4D, 4E).
ATG12 protein levels were reduced in both parental cells
overexpressing miR-200b, both in the presence or absence
of rapamycin. In addition, combined treatment with
rapamycin and AmiR-200b transfection had a cumulative
effect on ATG12 and LC3-II expression (Fig. 3F and
Supplementary Fig. 4F). Hence, miR-200b regulates both
starvation- and rapamycin-induced autophagy.

MiR-200b suppresses autophagy by directly
targeting ATG12
To further investigate the mechanisms of miR-200bdependent inhibition of autophagy, we sought to identify
putative autophagy-related targets of miR-200b, based on
the miRNA database(http://microRNA.org). The miR200b seed sequence matched nucleotides in the ATG12
sequence (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, using a dual-luciferase
reporter system we demonstrated that miR-200b binds
directly to the 3′UTR of ATG12 mRNA. This was done
by cloning full-length ATG12 3′UTR with or without five
point mutations with a luciferase reporter. Co-transfection
with a miR-200b mimic markedly inhibited luciferase
activity in the reporter vector containing the wild-type
ATG12 3′UTR but not the mutant 3′UTRs in both SPC-A1/
DTX and HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2B and Supplementary
Fig.  3). Consistent with these findings, docetaxelresistant cells, including SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX
cells, had higher basal ATG12 mRNA and protein levels
compared with their parental cells (Fig. 2C). Additionally,
overexpression of miR-200b decreased ATG12 mRNA
and protein levels in both SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/
DTX cells, whereas silencing endogenous miR-200b
increased ATG12 expression in parental cells (Fig.  2D
and Supplementary Fig. 1C). Similar to miR-200b
overexpression, silencing ATG12 prevented both LC3-II
accumulation and P62 degradation in docetaxel-resistant
cells (Fig. 2E).
As a final confirmation of the inhibitory effect of
miR-200b on ATG12, we performed rescue experiments
by overexpressing ATG12 in SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/
DTX cells, which largely negated miR-200b-dependent
autophagy suppression, as demonstrated by elevated
LC3-II expression, which approached the level in control
cells, and the increased percentage of GFP-positive cells
(Fig. 2F, 2G). Taken together these results demonstrate
that ATG12 is a direct target of miR-200b.

MiR-200b increases chemosensitivity of LAD
cells by targeting ATG12 in vitro
Based on the finding that miR-200b was the most
greatly downregulated miRNA in SPC-A1/DTX cells
compared with parental SPC-A1 cells, we sought to
evaluate whether miR-200b-induced chemosensitivity
was dependent on ATG12 suppression. Restoration of
miR-200b or ATG12 knockdown caused cell death and
suppressed growth of SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX
cells, as shown by MTT and colony formation assays,
respectively (Fig. 4A, 4B and Supplementary Fig. 5A, 5B).
Notably, the PmiR-200b-dependent cytotoxic effects
of docetaxel and cisplatin were eliminated by ectopic
expression of ATG12. Consistent with these data, a lossof-function study verified that AmiR-200b limited the
cell killing efficiency and promoted colony-formation
efficiency of these agents in SPC-A1 and H1299 cells,
but that these events were reversed by ATG12 silencing
(Fig. 4C, 4D and Supplementary Fig. 5C, 5D).
Next we determined the effect of miR-200b on
apoptosis. Compared with the control group, miR-200b

Meanwhile, transfection of SPC-A1 and H1299 cells
with the miR-200b inhibitor substantially diminished
drug-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C, 5D and Supplementary
Fig. 6C, 6D). Taken together, these data indicate that
miR-200b enhances the chemosensitivity of LAD cells
in an ATG12-dependent manner.

(Fig. 7C). LAD tissue samples were next categorized as
miR-200b-high or -low using the median miR-200b mRNA
expression level as threshold (median = 1.86, normalized to
U6 snRNA). Low miR-200b expression was significantly
correlated with advanced clinical stage and poor response to
docetaxel-based chemotherapy (Fig. 7D).
The association of miR-200b expression with patient
survival was further analyzed. Patients with a low miR200b expression (n = 34) had a shorter progression free
survival (PFS) than those patients with high miR-200b
expression (n = 26; median: 3.4 months vs. 4.4 months).
Therefore, these data strongly suggest that decreased
miR-200b expression, which is inversely correlated with
ATG12 expression in LAD patients, is linked to poor
prognosis (Table 1).

MiR-200b enhances the antitumor efficacy of
docetaxel in vivo
To investigate the effect of miR-200b on docetaxel
sensitivity of LAD in vivo, SPC-A1/DTX cells were stably
transfected with a miR-200b plasmid construct (pcDNA/
miR-200b) or control plasmid (pcDNA/miR-NC) and
subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice. Tumor-bearing
mice were treated with docetaxel at a dose of 1 mg/kg every
other day with three doses in total and tumor volumes were
monitored daily. Tumors derived from pcDNA/miR-200btransfected SPC-A1/DTX cells were substantially smaller
than the control group. Remarkably, SPC-A1/DTX-derived
tumor outgrowth was prevented when docetaxel treatment
was administered in a miR-200b-overexpressed genetic
background (Fig. 6A,  6B). Immunohistochemistry and
western blot analysis of the tumor specimens confirmed
diminished ATG12 expression and decreased autophagy
activity in pcDNA/miR-200b-transfected tumors in
response to docetaxel when compared with pcDNA/miRNC-transfected tumors (Fig 6B, 6C). TUNEL staining of
xenografts showed higher apoptosis in the pcDNA/miR200 group than in the control group following treatment
with docetaxel (Fig.  6C). Conversely, ki67 (a marker of
cell proliferation [21]) was clearly diminished in pcDNA/
miR-200b-transfected tumors (Fig. 6C). These observations
provide further evidence for the role of miR-200b in
determining the response of NSCLC cells to docetaxel
in vivo.

DISSCUSSION
Autophagy is considered to play a dual role in
the regulation of cell fate decision in the context of
cancer treatment [22]. Numerous studies have focused
on the association between the cytoprotective effects
of autophagy and the development of chemoresistance.
Several autophagy inhibitors are now in clinical trials
[23]. Importantly, miRNAs are frequently dysregulated in
chemo- or radio-resistant cancers, where they have been
shown to target autophagy-related genes or modulators
[24–26]. Based on our previously reported miRNA
microarray-based profile between docetaxel-sensitive
SPC-A1 cells and resistant SPC-A1/DTX cells, we
hypothesized that the differentially expressed miRNAs are
associated with docetaxel resistance, with miR-200b being
the most significantly down-regulated miRNA in SPC-A1/
DTX cells. Here, we show that introduction of exogenous
miR-200b into SPC-A1/DTX cells suppressed autophagy
activity and resensitized cells to chemotherapy. Inversely,
silencing endogenous miR-200b induced autophagy in
SPC-A1 cells and increased resistance to chemotherapy.
These results reveal a tight relationship between miR-200b
and autophagy activation in LAD.
The miR-200 family is aberrantly expressed in
a variety of cancers [27, 28], and regulates multiple
pathway components including a number of transcription
factors involved in tumor migration and invasion [29]
[30]. In the present study, we uncovered a novel role
for miR-200b in autophagy regulation and identified
ATG12 as a direct miR-200b target. In LAD cells,
endogenous miR-200b was downregulated in response
to cellular stress caused by starvation and rapamycin,
followed by upregulation of ATG12. Downregulation
of miR-200b upon autophagy stimulation might remove
translational inhibition on ATG12 and subsequently
promote autophagosome formation. However, further
introduction of exogenous miR-200b greatly decreased
ATG12 expression and blocked starvation and rapamycininduced autophagy.

Downregulation of miR-200b correlates with
upregulation of ATG12, decreased sensitivity
to docetaxel and poor prognosis in lung
adenocarcinoma tissues
To further investigate the relationship between
miR-200b and ATG12 expression in vivo, tissue samples
were obtained from 60 clinical LAD cases from patients
diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Samples
were classified as “sensitive” or “insensitive” depending on
the responses to docetaxel-based chemotherapies. According
to the data in Fig. 7A, miR-200b mRNA expression was
markedly decreased in the “insensitive” group compared
with the “sensitive” group, and vice versa in the case of
ATG12 mRNA expression. ATG12 protein expression
was similarly decreased in the “sensitive” tumor tissues,
as measured by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 7B).
This inverse association between miR-200b and ATG12
expression was significant based on linear regression analysis

Figure 7: Downregulation of miR-200b expression correlates with upregulation of ATG12 expression, decreased
sensitivity to docetaxel and poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. A. qRT-PCR was performed to analyze the
relative mRNA expression of miR-200b and ATG12 in docetaxel-sensitive (n = 27) and insensitive (n = 33) LAD tissues. MiR-200b and
ATG12 mRNA abundances were normalized to U6 RNA and GAPDH, respectively. B. Protein expression of ATG12 was determined by
immunochemical staining (magnification 200×). C. Expression levels of miR-200b and ATG12 mRNA were inversely correlated among
tissue samples as measured by linear regression analysis. D. The Kaplan–Meier survival curve shows that patients with high miR-200b
expression have shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those with low miR-200b expression (log-rank test, P = 0.021). Data are
expressed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.

ATG12 is a key component in autophagosome
formation and is upregulated in trastuzumab-unresponsive
breast cancer cells [31] and radioresistant pancreatic
cancer cells [32]. Our work shows that ATG12 is also
upregulated in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. Both ATG12
silencing and miR-200b overexpression significantly
sensitized SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX cells to
docetaxel and cisplatin.
In an in vivo setting, miR-200b overexpression
drastically attenuated ATG12 expression and subsequent
autophagy activity, preventing long-term tumor cell survival
by exposing them to metabolic stress and suppressing
eventual tumor regrowth following docetaxel treatment.
Consistent with these findings, miR-200b was inversely
correlated with ATG12 in clinical docetaxel-treated LAD
tissue samples. Specifically, a relative increase in miR200b coupled with a decrease in ATG12 expression was
observed in tissue samples from docetaxel-sensitive patients.
Moreover, patients with relatively lower levels of miR-200b
expression had poorer prognosis. Taken together, our data
therefore provide, for the first time, evidence that miR-200b
could significantly affect LAD chemosensitivity through
negative regulation of autophagy-related genes (Fig. 8).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Interestingly, another miRNA, miR-23b, has also
been reported to target ATG12 with different 3′UTR
sequences (bases 172–178 and 1281–1288) than miR-200b
(bases 946–952) [32]. Considering the imperfect match
and relatively short base pair seed sequence characteristic
of miRNA–mRNA interactions, it is not surprising that
a single miRNA can concurrently target multiple genes
while a single mRNA may have multiple miRNA target
sites [33].
Apart from ATG12, there are over 35 other autophagyrelated gene products and autophagy-regulating factors [7].
For instance, we previously reported that the autophagy
modulator HMGB1 promotes formation of the Beclin1-PI3K-III complex by activating the MEK/ERK1/2
signaling pathway, thereby accelerating autophagosome
nucleation [12]. A recent study suggests that miR-34a
may modulate HMGB1 gene expression and subsequent
autophagic response [34]. However, we did not find a
putative miR-200b-binding site within the 3′UTR of
HMGB1 or significant changes in HMGB1 levels when
modulating miR-200b expression (Data not shown). The
miR-200b-ATG12 and HMGB1-MEK/ERK1/2-Beclin1/
PI3K-III pathways seem to be concurrently implicated in

autophagic abnormalities of LAD cells. Further studies
are warranted to elucidate the relationship between these
two mechanisms in order to expand our understanding of
autophagy.
Taken together, the present work demonstrates for
the first time that miR-200b could decrease autophagy
activity and increase chemotherapy-induced cell death by
targeting ATG12 in LAD cells. Therefore, targeting miR200b-ATG12 signaling may be a potential strategy for
reversing chemoresistance in combating LAD.

reactions were: 95°C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of
95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s, using a StepOnePlus™
thermal cycler. MiRNA expression levels were normalized
to U6 RNA. SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan, Cat.
No. RR420A) was also used to detect mRNA. SYBR
Green quantitative PCR amplifications were performed
on a StepOnePlus™ thermal cycler, in 25 μl volumes
containing 12.5 μl of 2 × SYBR Green PCR Master Mix.
The thermal profile for real-time PCR was: 95°C for 30 s;
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 30 s and
70°C for 30 s. Relative mRNA expression was normalized
to GAPDH using the comparative ΔΔCT method; values
are expressed as 2−ΔΔCT. Primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table 1.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were
exposed to various treatments, and then seed into 6-well
plates. Cells were allowed to adhere and grow for between
10 to 14 days. To visualize colonies, cells were fixed with
methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies
with ≥50 cells were manually counted under a dissection
microscope.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed with PBS, harvested in icecold PBS and centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4°C. Cells were
placed for 30 min on ice in RIPA buffer in the presence of
a cocktail proteinase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The
protein lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred
onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA), and analyzed
as described previously [15].

Apoptosis assay
We measured apoptosis using an AnnexinV-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit
(Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) that
quantitatively measures percentages of early apoptotic
cells via flow cytometry. Western blot analyses for
c-PARP and c-caspase-3 after various treatments were
also performed. The degree of apoptosis in tissues was
assessed with the TUNEL kit (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Takara,
Japan) reagent and concentrations were measured by a
spectrophotometer. Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR
were conducted using SYBR PrimeScript™ miRNA RTPCR kit (Takara, Japan, Cat. No. RR716) according to

Cells were lysed in passive lysing buffer and then
analyzed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using
the commercial Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system
(Promega, E1910) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to
the Renilla luciferase activity.

Tissue samples
A total of 60 lung adenocarcinoma cancer tissues
were obtained from the Department of Cardiothoracic
Surgery, Jinling Hospital between 2006 and 2010.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Jinling Hospital. All patients met the following criteria:
a histological diagnosis of primary LAD with at least
one measurable lesion; clinical stage IIIB–IV; first-line
chemotherapy with either docetaxel 75mg/m2 and cisplatin
100 mg/m2 or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin (area
under the curve 6mg/mL/min) administered every
3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles; availability of
sufficient tumor tissue in paraffin blocks for assessment
by immunohistochemistry. Tumor response was examined
by computed tomography and evaluated according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable
disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). Based on the
above response evaluation criterion, tumor samples were
divided into “sensitive” (CR or PR) and “insensitive” (SD
or PD) groups.

GFP-LC3 analysis
Forty-eight hours after GFP-LC3 transfection, cells
were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, washed with
PBS, mounted in glycerol in PBS and inspected using a
fluorescence microscope. Cells with ≥10 GFP-LC3 dots
were considered positive. At least 150 GFP positive cells
were counted under each condition, and the graphs were
plotted as percentage of GFP-LC3 dot positive cells
divided by the total GFP-positive cell population.

Transmission electron microscopy
Cells harvested by trypsinization were fixed in
2.5% glutaraldehyde plus 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer, and then post-fixed in 1% tetroxide buffer.
After dehydration in a graded series of acetone, cells were
embedded in spur resin. Thin sections were cut on a Reichert
Ultracut E microtome. Sectioned grids were stained with
saturated solution of uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SD of ≥ three separate
experiments. SPSS17.0 software was used for statistical
analysis. Multiple group comparisons were analyzed
with one-way ANOVA; two-group comparisons were
performed with Student’s t test. Survival probabilities
were determined using Kaplan–Meier analyses and
compared by the log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Mice xenograft models and
immunohistochemistry analysis
Animal maintenance and experimental procedures
were strictly performed following the guidelines of the
Institutional Review Board and approved by the Ethics
Committee of Jinling Hospital. Approximately 5 × 106
SPC-A1/DTX/pcDNA miR-200b or SPC-A1/DTX/
miR-NC cells were subcutaneously transplanted into
twelve 6-week-old BALB/c mice (six mice for SPC-A1/
DTX/pcDNA miR-200b cells, and six for SPC-A1/
DTX/miR-NC cells). Tumor volumes were examined
every other day and were calculated using the equation:
V = A × B2/2(mm3), where A is the largest diameter and
B is the perpendicular diameter. When the average tumor
size reached approximately 100 mm3, docetaxel was
administered via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of
1 mg/kg at one dose every other day for a total of three
doses. In each of the group transplanted with SPC-A1/
DTX/pcDNA miR-200b cells or SPC-A1/DTX/miRNC cells, three mice were injected with docetaxel and
three were injected with 0.9% normal saline as control.
All mice were sacrificed 16 days later, and the tumors
were dissected out. The primary tumors were excised
and analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining,
immunohistochemistry staining of proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA), ATG12, TUNEL staining
