Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The external pH of solid tumors is acidic as a consequence of increased metabolism of glucose and
poor perfusion. Acid pH has been shown to stimulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and
in cells before tail vein injection in vivo. The present study investigates whether inhibition of this
tumor acidity will reduce the incidence of in vivo metastases. Here, we show that oral NaHCO3
selectively increased the pH of tumors and reduced the formation of spontaneous metastases in mouse
models of metastatic breast cancer. This treatment regimen was shown to significantly increase the
extracellular pH, but not the intracellular pH, of tumors by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
the export of acid from growing tumors by fluorescence microscopy of tumors grown in window
chambers. NaHCO3 therapy also reduced the rate of lymph node involvement, yet did not affect the
levels of circulating tumor cells, suggesting that reduced organ metastases were not due to increased
intravasation. In contrast, NaHCO3 therapy significantly reduced the formation of hepatic metastases
following intrasplenic injection, suggesting that it did inhibit extravasation and colonization. In tail
vein injections of alternative cancer models, bicarbonate had mixed results, inhibiting the formation
of metastases from PC3M prostate cancer cells, but not those of B16 melanoma. Although the
mechanism of this therapy is not known with certainty, low pH was shown to increase the release of
active cathepsin B, an important matrix remodeling protease.

Introduction
The extracellular pH (pHe) of malignant solid tumors is acidic, in the range of 6.5 to 6.9,
whereas the pHe of normal tissues is significantly more alkaline, 7.2 to 7.5 (1–3). Mathematical
models of the tumor-host interface (4) and in vivo measurements have shown that solid tumors
export acid into the surrounding parenchyma (5,6). Previous in vitro studies have shown that
tumor cell invasion can be stimulated by acidic conditions and that this may involve lysosomal
proteases (7–9). These observations have led to the “acid-mediated invasion hypothesis,”
wherein tumor-derived acid facilitates tumor invasion by promoting normal cell death and
extracellular matrix degradation of the parenchyma surrounding growing tumors. Furthermore,
pretreatment of tumor cells with acid before injection leads to increased experimental
metastases (10,11), and these observations suggest that low pH up-regulates proinvasive and

survival pathways. It has been argued that metastatic cancers are selected for their ability to
export acid (12). Acid is a by-product of glucose metabolism, and notably, elevated
consumption of fluorodeoxyglucose by more aggressive cancers has been observed with
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (13).

The current work tests the hypothesis that neutralizing the acid pH of tumors will inhibit
invasion and, hence, reduce the incidence of spontaneous metastases. Acid pH was inhibited
using oral NaHCO3, which has previously been shown to effectively reverse pH gradients in
tumors and not affect the pHe of normal tissues (14). This was confirmed in the current study
using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and fluorescence ratio imaging of
SNARF-1 in a dorsal skin-fold window chamber. Notably, bicarbonate did not affect the
systemic pH or the growth rate of primary tumors but had significant effects on the formation
of spontaneous metastases. In two of three experiments, NaHCO3 therapy reduced the
colonization of lymph nodes, but in no experiment did it significantly affect the levels of
circulating tumor cells. The lymphatic results notwithstanding, these results indicate that
inhibition of end-organ metastasis did not occur by a reduction of intravasation. In contrast,
the formation of liver metastases following intrasplenic injection of MDA-MB-231 cells was
significantly reduced, indicating that end-organ colonization of metastatic sites was affected
by NaHCO3 therapy. Similarly, metastases following tail vein injection of PC3M prostate
cancer cells were also inhibited by bicarbonate treatment, yet those of B16 melanoma were
not. Preliminary investigations into possible mechanisms showed that the release of active
cathepsin B into pericellular space was significantly increased by acidic conditions, and thus,
NaHCO3 therapy may be acting to inhibit the release of this important matrix remodeling
protease.

Materials and Methods
Animals
All animals were maintained under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved
protocols at either the University of Arizona or H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. Six- to eightweek-old female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were used as hosts for MDAMB-231 tumors, 6-wk-old male SCID beige mice for PC3M tumors, and nu/nu mice for B16
tumors.
β-Galactosidase staining

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Harvested lung tissue was sliced into 1-mm sections and placed in PBS containing 2 mmol/L
MgCl2 (Mg-PBS) on ice. Sections were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in Mg-PBS on ice for
30 min and afterward rinsed in PBS to remove residual fixative. Fixed sections were then
incubated for 3 h at 37°C in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside reaction buffer
(35 mmol/L potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.02% NP40, and 0.01% Na
deoxycholate in PBS). After incubation, the tissue sections were washed and stored in PBS.
Sections were analyzed using a Stereomaster 4× dissecting microscope (Fisher Scientific) with
mounted DC290 ZOOM digital camera (Eastman Kodak Company). Images were captured at
the same focal plane with an exposure time of 1/10 s for white-light illumination. βGalactosidase positive lesions were measured and counted manually by a blinded observer.
Intrasplenic injections
MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 105) expressing a thermostable firefly luciferase (15) were injected
into the spleens of SCID mice. Three days postinjection, mice were randomized into
bicarbonate and control therapies. Twenty-five days postinjection, spleens and livers were
collected and placed in white, clear-bottom, sterile 12-well microtiter plates. Luciferase images
were acquired using a VersArray 1300B cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper

Scientific) at 10-min exposures, f2.2. Image data were analyzed with ImageJ. After image
acquisition, spleens and livers were homogenized in homogenization buffer (Promega) with
five passes in a Dounce homogenizer, followed by addition of 1 volume of cell lysis buffer
(Promega). Homogenates were mixed 1:1 with luciferase solution (Promega) and light
emission was determined using a Wallac Victor3 (Perkin-Elmer) microtiter plate reader (16).
Intravasation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The first step of metastatic spread involves movement of cancer cells from the primary site
into the bloodstream (intravasation) either directly or indirectly through the lymphatics (17).
Measurement of MDA-MB-231/eGFP cells in the blood of tumor-bearing SCID mice was
determined by three methods in two separate experiments. In one experiment (113007),
untreated (n = 3) and 200 mmol/L bicarbonate–treated (n = 7) animals bearing primary tumors
were euthanized after 36 d of tumor growth. At this time point, the primary tumors averaged
463 ± 33.5 mm3 in size in both groups. Blood was extracted by cardiac puncture into microfuge
tubes and mixed with an equal volume of 100 mmol/L EDTA to prevent clotting. A blood
volume of 10 μL was smeared on glass slides and dried. Green-fluorescing cells were counted
manually under a fluorescent microscope at ×40 magnification. Nucleated cells from the
remaining blood volume (∼ 300 μL) were obtained by centrifugation with Histopaque (Sigma),
and resulting cells were resuspended in 96-well plates in 100 μL of PBS and measured on a
Victor3 with excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. In another experiment
(011508), blood was extracted by heart puncture from untreated and bicarbonate-treated mice
(n = 8 each) by the same methods as above. Average tumor size was 121.8 ± 16.4 mm3. RBC
were lysed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting lysing solution (BD Sciences) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were counter-labeled with LDS-751 nucleic acid dye
and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) with a 488-nm argon laser.
LDS-751 emits at 670 nm upon excitation at 488 nm and is detectable with the fluorescence 3
detector. Nonspecific fluorescence was differentiated from the green fluorescent protein (GFP)
signal by gating on cellular light scattering properties and LDS-751.
Dorsal skin-fold window chamber

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor constructs were engineered using the tumor droplet method. MDA-MB-231 cells were
suspended in 2.5 mg/mL type I collagen (BD Biosciences) and 1× DMEM at a final
concentration of 1 × 106 to 2.5 × 106 cells/mL. Using a 48-well non–tissue-cultured plate, a
15-μL drop of the tumor cell suspension was polymerized in the center of the well. Following
brief polymerization (∼1–2 min) at 37°C in the incubator, 200 mL of media [DMEM with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS)] were added to the wells and the droplets were left until the addition
of stromal mix. The stromal mix consisted of 3 mg/mL type I collagen, 1× DMEM, and
∼12,000 to 15,000 microvessel fragments/mL. Typically, when microvessel fragments are
directly reconstituted with type I collagen, they undergo spontaneous angiogenesis by day 3
or day 4 in vitro and following implantation anastamose with the host vasculature and form a
vascular network (days 4–7 in window chamber). After 2 d in culture, these constructs were
removed with forceps and placed directly into the window chamber.
Because the tumors were relatively circular, growth was analyzed along the horizontal and
vertical diameters. At the image magnification, each pixel was equal to ∼25 μm. The mean of
the horizontal and vertical diameter was used to report the tumor diameter at the time of
imaging. Tumor density was estimated based on the gray-level intensity homogeneity in the
tumor region of interest. This estimated tumor density was calculated by first computing the
gray-level co-occurrence matrix of tumor region. Using the gray-level statistics generated by
the gray-level co-occurrence matrix, the gray-level intensity homogeneity was calculated, a
metric reflective of the likelihood that neighboring pixels are the same intensity. A higher

homogeneity value was suggestive of a denser tumor because the intensities would vary less
from pixel to pixel in regions of high cellularity.

Cathepsin-B activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cathepsin-B measurements were carried out in a “real-time” assay as described by Linebaugh
and colleagues (18). Briefly, cells were exposed to a fluorogenic substrate (Z-Arg-ArgNHMec) in an enclosed system that monitored the rate of fluorescent product (NH2Mec)
formation. MDA-MB-231 cells grown on coverslips to 60% to 80% confluence, washed with
Dulbecco's NaCl/Pi, and equilibrated in assay buffer without substrate at 37°C for 5 min.
Measurements consisted of (a) a fluorescence baseline for the assay buffer containing 100
μmol/L Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec substrate for 5 min; (b) the rate of fluorescent product formation
due to the introduction of cells followed over 10 min; (c) the rate of fluorescent product
formation after removal of cells from the cuvette followed over 10 min; and (d) the rate of
fluorescent product formation when cells are placed back in cuvette and cell membrane
permeabilized by adding 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Cathepsin-B activity was measured
following equilibration of cells in media containing 25 mmol/L PIPES at pH 6.8 and 7.4 for 3
d, followed by overnight incubation in 0.2% FBS at the respective pH values. A cathepsin-B
inhibitor, CA074, was added at a final concentration of 10 μmol/L to confirm that the activity
measured was due to cathepsin B (19). Measurements were recorded in a Shimadzu RF-450
spectrofluorometer, with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm, equipped with a
temperature-controlled cuvette holder, microstirrer, and a DR-3 data chart recorder. After data
acquisition, the DNA content on each coverslip was determined by measuring fluorescence
using SYBR Green I nucleic acid stain (Molecular Probes) in a microtiter plate at 485-nm
excitation and 535-nm emission. Concentrations were calculated based on the salmon sperm
DNA standard curve. The rate of product formation was expressed as picomoles per minute
per microgram of DNA.
Statistics
All statistical calculations were determined using the analysis feature in Prism version 4.03 for
Windows (GraphPad Software) or Microsoft Excel. To compare two means, statistical
significance was determined by unpaired, one-tailed Student's t tests assuming equal variance.
If variances were significantly different (P < 0.0001), a Welch's correction for unequal
variances was applied. A log-rank test was applied to survival data. A Mann-WhitneyWilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare independent groups whose data were ordinal but
not interval-scaled.

Results and Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In initial experiments, metastatic MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells were orthotopically
injected into mammary fat pads of female immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Six days after
injection, mice were randomized into two groups: one (control) was provided with drinking
water and the other (bicarbonate) was provided with 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 ad libitum, which
continued for the duration of the experiment. Bicarbonate therapy had no effect on either the
animal weights or the rates of growth of the primary tumors. The lack of effects on animal
weights (P = 0.98) is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A, and these data were interpreted to
indicate that this therapy did not lead to dehydration because dehydration quickly leads to
significant weight loss in experimental mice. Bicarbonate-treated mice drank, on average, 4.2
± 0.2 mL of water per day, whereas control mice consumed 3.3 ± 0.1 mL/d. The daily intake
of bicarbonate was thus calculated to be 36 ± 1.7 mmol/kg/d (9.4 g/m2/d). An equivalent dose
in a 70-kg human would be 12.5 g/d (20). The lack of an effect on the growth of the primary
tumors (P = 0.80) is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1B to D. Although bicarbonate effectively

increased the pHe of these large tumors, it did not affect the intracellular pH (pHi), as measured
by MRS (see below), and this may be reflected in a lack of an effect on growth rates (21, 22).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite a lack of an effect on primary tumor growth, bicarbonate therapy led to significant
reductions in the number and size of metastases to lung, intestine, and diaphragm. Figure 1A
and B shows the size and number of β-galactosidase expressing spontaneous lung metastases
after 30 and 60 days of primary tumor growth, respectively. In the 30-day experiment, pooled
data (n = 12 mice per group) showed that the bicarbonate-treated mice had a total of 147
metastatic lung lesions, whereas the control group had 326 lung lesions (P = 0.03). The average
lesion diameters (± SE) were 4.5 ± 0.12 and 5.2 ± 0.14 mm in the NaHCO3 and control groups,
respectively (P < 0.0001). In the 60-day experiment (n = 20 and 15 for control and NaHCO3
groups, respectively), the numbers of pixels associated with lesions >60 μm in diameter were
scored. The average numbers of lesion pixels per animal in control and NaHCO3 groups were
382 and 74, respectively (P = 0.0004). None of the animals treated with NaHCO3 had more
than 240 lesion pixels per animal, whereas 10 of 20 of the control animals had more than 240
lesion pixels. Both experiments showed dramatically fewer lesions in the bicarbonate-treated
group than in control animals.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This reduction in metastases also led to increased survival. Figure 1C shows the Kaplan-Meier
survival curve, which shows that bicarbonate therapy increased survival (log-rank; P = 0.027).
As shown in Fig. 2, on necropsy, the control group contained significant and notable fluorescent
lung lesions, whereas the bicarbonate group had little, if any, fluorescence (Wilcoxon ranksum test, P = 0.0015). These data were quantified for other metastatic sites in all animals and
showed reductions in frequency and fluorescence density in visceral organ (intestines,
pancreas, liver, spleen, bladder, and liver) and mesenteric metastases in the bicarbonate-treated
groups (Fig. 3A). These data are notable in that the effect of the bicarbonate therapy was greater
than in any of the previous experiments, yet the median ages of sacrifice were >100 days for
both control and bicarbonate groups (i.e., significantly longer than either of the previous
experiments).

Although it has previously been shown that chronic oral NaHCO3 can lead to reversal of tumor
acidosis (14), this was confirmed here for the MDA-MB-231 tumor model using 31P MRS of
tumor-bearing animals after 3 weeks of therapy (4 weeks postinoculation). pHi was measured
with the resonant frequency of inorganic phosphate, and pHe was measured with the exogenous
pH indicator 3-aminopropylphosphonate (23,24). 31P spectra of NaHCO3-treated tumors
exhibited significant shifts in the resonant frequency of 3-aminopropylphosphonate, with little
or no change in the frequency of inorganic phosphate (Fig. 4). Average pHe values were 7.4
± 0.06 in the NaHCO3-treated tumors, compared with pH 7.0 ± 0.11 under control conditions
(Fig. 4, inset). Notably, the pHi of tumors was unaffected, being 7.0 ± 0.06 and 7.1 ± 0.09
under treated and control conditions, respectively (Fig. 4, inset). The pHi and pHe were also
measured in nontumor tissues in the same animals (e.g., hind limb muscle) with the observation
that the pHi and pHe were unaffected by bicarbonate, being 7.22 ± 0.04 and 7.40 ± 0.08,
respectively, in both groups (data not shown), which was consistent with previous results
(14).
Despite significant effects on the formation of metastases and tumor pHe, chronic bicarbonate
therapy had no effect on blood chemistries, indicating that systemic pH was fully compensated
in these animals (Supplementary Table S1). Thus, as expected due to the chronic nature of the
treatment, NaHCO3 did not lead to systemic metabolic alkalosis. Rather, we hypothesize that
inhibition of tumor metastasis was due to increased bicarbonate “buffering” of interstitial fluid
of either the primary or the metastatic tumors. Thus, the bicarbonate levels in tumors were
increased to be consistent with the rest of the body, leading to a selective increase in tumor
pHe. This effect has been modeled using reaction diffusion kinetic modeling (25) and showed

that (a) in the face of a high acid load from hypermetabolic tumor cells, the bicarbonate effect
will be incomplete even at 200 mmol/L; and (b) alternative buffers with higher pKa values
should be more efficacious. Consistent with these predictions, a dose-response experiment with
a 30-day end point showed that concentrations as low as 50 mmol/L reduced the incidence of
spontaneous metastases, yet the largest effect was observed at the highest dose investigated,
200 mmol/L (Supplementary Table S2), indicating that, even at this dose, the effect is
incomplete. The lack of a complete effect was further investigated by inoculating mice (n = 3
per group) bearing dorsal skin-fold window chambers with GFP-transfected MDA-MB-231
tumor cells. As above, ad libitum 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 was begun 6 days postinoculation.
After 1 and 2 weeks of therapy, the pHe was measured by fluorescence ratio imaging of
SNARF-1, as described in Materials and Methods (5). Representative GFP images used for
segmentation are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. These were used to define a region of
interest delineating the tumor boundary, indicated by the solid red line. The corresponding
SNARF-1 ratio-derived pHe images for control and bicarbonate-treated animals are shown in
Fig. 5A and B, respectively. Note that pHe is more acidic in the control tumors and that this
acidity extends beyond the tumor boundary, whereas the acid pHe regions of the bicarbonatetreated mice were confined within the tumor volume. Data were analyzed along coaxial radial
lines drawn from the centroid of the tumor (Fig. 5C) and the least squares fit for all experiments
is shown in Fig. 5D, with the centroid located at “0”and the edge of the tumor indicated by the
vertical line. Table 1C shows that, whereas the intratumoral pHe was not significantly affected
in the bicarbonate group (P = 0.19), the peritumoral pHe, measured within 0.2 mm of the tumor
edge, was significantly higher in the bicarbonate-treated group compared with controls (P =
0.05). Thus, both fluorescence and MRS showed higher tumor pHe values in the bicarbonatetreated groups, although the MRS showed a greater effect. These apparent differences may be
due to the different preparations, such as measurement by two different techniques (MRS
versus fluorescence) in two different systems (orthotopic versus heterotopic) following two
different treatment times (21 versus 7 days). Follow-up imaging of window chambers 7 days
later showed that the changes in tumor diameters were not significantly different between
groups, but that there were significant (P = 0.002) differences in the tumor densities.
Specifically, the densities increased with time in the control tumors and decreased in the
bicarbonate-treated tumors. Whereas the importance of these observations is not clear, it may
lead to a practical application. Tumor cell densities can be measured noninvasively using
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (26), and hence, this imaging modality may
be useful as a quantitative biomarker for the effects of bicarbonate therapy in vivo.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To begin investigating the mechanism of the bicarbonate effect, experiments were designed to
separate early events (intravasation) from later events (extravasation and colonization) of the
spontaneous metastasis paradigm. Spontaneous metastases occur via movement of tumor cells
from the primary tumor into the bloodstream (intravasation), either directly or indirectly
through the lymphatics. In xenografts, this can involve active local invasion or a passive process
of shedding (27). Following intravasation, the circulating tumor cells lodge and colonize in
distant sites. There is some controversy whether this occurs via simple lodging of circulating
tumor cells in small vessels (prompting local ischemia) or whether it involves specific
interaction of circulating tumor cells with post-capillary endothelia followed by extravasation
(17,28). To investigate the effect of bicarbonate therapy on intravasation, the incidences of
lymphatic involvement and circulating tumor cells were quantified. Lymph node status was
assessed in SCID mice inoculated with GFP-expressing MDA-MB-231 tumor cells, which
were randomized into control (n = 12) and bicarbonate-treated (n = 11) groups. Primary tumors
were grown for 40 days (to volumes of 800–1000 mm3), at which time the animals were
sacrificed and lymph nodes and other organs examined by fluorescence imaging. For the
purpose of scoring, lymph nodes were characterized as “trace,” with a few fluorescent colonies,
or “positive,” wherein the entire lymph node was inflamed. Examples of these are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S3. Mice were scored from 0 to 6, as described in Supplementary Table

S3, and these analyses showed that most had lymphatic involvement, with those of the
NaHCO3-treated animals being less developed. The majority of the NaHCO3-treated animals
(9 of 12) had only traces of fluorescence in their lymph nodes, whereas 7 of 11 of the control
group had strongly positive nodes and/or metastases (P = 0.044, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon).
Similarly, the lymph node involvement in the survival study showed a more significant effect
on the development of lymph node metastases to >300 mm3 (log-rank P = 0.02). As a further
test of intravasation, circulating tumor cells were measured in blood from mice bearing GFPexpressing tumors by manual counting of whole blood smears, flow cytometry following
erythrocyte hemolysis, and raw fluorescence of blood extracts. With all end points, there were
low numbers of circulating tumor cells and no evidence to suggest differences between
bicarbonate-treated and control groups (Table 1A). From these data, we conclude that, whereas
bicarbonate may have an effect on lymph node colonization, this does not conclusively lead
to an increase in the numbers of circulating tumor cells, although this conclusion is tempered
by the low numbers of circulating tumor cells in both conditions.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The effect of bicarbonate therapy on extravasation was measured in two ways. Because breast
cancer commonly metastasizes to the liver, the incidence of liver metastases 21 days after
intrasplenic injection of 104 luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells was used as a measure
of extravasation for this system (29). Table 1B shows that the luciferase levels in livers of
bicarbonate-treated mice were significantly lower than those in controls, whether expressed as
raw counts or normalized to splenic luciferase values. Thus, in this system, bicarbonate therapy
had a more pronounced effect on the process of extravasation and colonization compared with
intravasation. The generality of this phenomenon was examined in other cancer models by
monitoring metastases following tail vein injection of luciferase-expressing PC3M human
prostate cancer cells or B16 mouse melanoma cells. Supplementary Fig. S4 shows luciferase
images from both systems that show a clear difference in the PC3M system and a clear lack of
an effect in the B16 system. The progression of metastases in PC3M is shown in Supplementary
Fig. S5, with the difference between bicarbonate and controls groups being significant (P =
0.04) at 35 days. Although the differences in the B16 system were not significantly different,
the pooled values for the bicarbonate group were consistently lower than those of controls at
all time points (data not shown). It should also be noted that the B16 tumors are much faster
growing, leading to termination of all animals at 17 days, compared with >42 days for the
PC3M tumors. Thus, either these cells colonize in a pH-independent fashion or their rates of
acid production simply overpower the ability of bicarbonate to effectively buffer the pH (25).
Nonetheless, these data show that, for at least two human cancers (MDA-MB-231 and PC3M),
bicarbonate reduces the efficiency of tumor colonization at distant sites.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The effects of bicarbonate observed in this study could be exerted at either the primary or the
metastatic site, and these are currently under investigation. On one hand, it may be that the
acid pH of the primary tumor induces a stress response in these cells, leading to increased
survival. This would be consistent with previous observations of Hill and Rofstad, who showed
that pretreatment of melanoma cells with acid pH before injection leads to enhanced survival
at metastatic sites (10,11). Alternatively, it is possible that the bicarbonate buffering inhibits
local invasion at the metastatic site. This has been formulated as the acid-mediated invasion
hypothesis, wherein tumor-derived acid is excreted into the surrounding parenchyma, leading
to degradation of the surrounding extracellular matrix (5).
Whether at the primary or the metastatic site, acid pH seems to stimulate invasive behavior
and increased survival, either by selection or induction (7–9). Acid pH has been shown to
induce the expression and activity of a number of systems involved in matrix remodeling. These
include matrix metalloproteinases such as collagenase (MMP1) or gelatinases (MMP-2 or
MMP-9; refs. 8,10,30); lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B, D, or L (9,31,32), which may
result from acid-induced lysosomal turnover (7,33); and hyaluronidase and the hyaluronan

receptor CD44 (34–36). Additionally, low pH can stimulate neoangiogenesis through induction
of vascular endothelial growth factor or interleukin-8 (10,37–39), or it may stimulate invasion
simply by inducing apoptosis in parenchymal cells (40,41), as we have previously shown (5),
at the same time selecting for tumor cells that are apoptosis resistant. Notably, CD44 is
associated with breast cancer cells with stem cell–like properties, and these are noted for being
resistant to environmentally induced apoptosis (42,43). To begin investigating the myriad of
possible molecular mechanisms, we assayed cathepsin B (18) in acid-treated MDA-MB-231
cells, and we observed that the activity of this protease secreted into the media was increased
up to 4-fold, with no effect on the cell-associated activities (Fig. 3B). Thus, it seems that the
acid pHe of tumors can induce the release of this protease that is involved in extracellular
matrix turnover in breast cancer (44). Experiments are under way to determine if bicarbonate
therapy will inhibit this activity in vivo.

Conclusions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The above data have shown that oral bicarbonate therapy significantly reduced the incidence
of metastases in experimental models of breast and prostate cancer and that the effect seems
to be primarily on distal (i.e., colonization), rather than proximal (i.e., intravasation), processes.
It is not known whether bicarbonate is exerting its effects by decreasing survival of circulating
tumor cells (although the numbers are not affected) or by inhibiting colonization at the
metastatic site. Increases in pHe significantly reduced the release of a lysosomal protease,
cathepsin B.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Medically, the idea of treating cancer through p.o. administration of buffers is attractive but
tethered to caveats. Reaction diffusion models show that the effect of bicarbonate on the pHe
gradient will be graded with dose and that, at the current dose of 200 mmol/L, is not saturating.
This dose translates to an intake of ∼1.5 μmol/h/g of whole mouse. By comparison, the acid
production rate of tumors can be ∼100 μmol/h/g of tumor weight (45). Thus, these doses of
NaHCO3 may be able to counteract the acid load of a 15-mg tumor, which translates to ∼
105 cells or a 1-mm3 micrometastasis. The effectiveness of this therapy will be reduced with
larger tumors (25). It is somewhat surprising that this incomplete effect had such a dramatic
effect on metastases. Another concern is that bicarbonate, with an effective pKa of 6.24, would
seem to be poorly suited as an alkalinizing buffer; thus, it is possible that better pHe control
and more dramatic antimetastatic effects will be observed with a higher pKa buffer. However,
it remains possible that this effect may be specific for buffers in the bicarbonate/CO2 family
through involvement of carbonic anhydrase activity, which is important to pH regulation in
tumors (46). Notwithstanding these concerns, however, the dramatic effect of bicarbonate
therapy on the formation of breast cancer metastases in this model system warrants further
investigation.

Effect of NaHCO3 on metastases and survival. MDA-MB-231 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection and maintained in growth media (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with
10% FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. These cells were stably
transfected with expression vectors for hygromycin-resistant pcDNA3.1/LacZ (Invitrogen).
These β-gal–labeled MDA-MB-231 cells (107), suspended in 0.2 mL of 0.8% sterile saline,
were injected s.c. into the left inguinal mammary fat pads of 6-wk-old female SCID mice. Mice
(n = 8) were started on drinking water (ad libitum) supplemented with 200 mmol/L NaHCO3
at 6 d postinjection and maintained along with untreated animals (n = 8). After 30 d of primary
tumor growth, the animals were sacrificed and the β-gal–positive lung lesions were counted
and sized after staining, as shown in A. Mean lesion diameters (P < 0.0001) and frequencies
(P = 0.0342) were significantly different between the two groups as determined by two-tailed
unpaired t test with Welch's correction for unequal variances. In a repeat of this experiment,
106 β-gal-MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into inguinal mammary fat pads, and control (n
= 9) and NaHCO3-treated (n = 15) animals were maintained for 60 d before sacrifice. In this
experiment, lung images were analyzed using ImagePro Plus to determine the metastatic tumor
burden by counting the number of β-gal–positive pixels per animal. B, numbers of lung lesions
per animal following 60 d of growth in the presence of NaHCO3 in drinking water. The
frequency of lesions per animal in the NaHCO3-treated mice was compared with that in
untreated controls by unpaired t test (P = 0.0004). In a third experiment, MDA-MB-231 cells
were stably transfected to express neomycin-resistant pcDNA3/EGFP (a gift from Peter
Ratcliffe, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom). MDA-MB-231/eGFP cells (6.5 ×
106) were injected into inguinal mammary fat pads of animals that were randomized into
bicarbonate and control groups (n = 12 per group) 6 d postinoculation. Tumors were allowed
to grow for 5 to 6 wk (to a volume of ∼600 mm3), at which time they were surgically removed.
If the primary regrew (as was the case in 9 of 24 animals), it was resected again. Animals were
monitored biweekly and maintained on bicarbonate or water until they evidenced a lymph node
lesion >300 mm3 in size, at which time they were sacrificed and necropsied by examination
with a fluorescence dissecting scope. Data from this experiment are plotted as a Kaplan-Meier
survival curve (C). The difference in the survival curve for the bicarbonate versus control
animals was tested using the log-rank test (P = 0.027).

Lung metastases. Images were obtained at time of sacrifice from individual (numbered) mice
in control and bicarbonate groups of the experiment shown in Fig. 1C. At time of necropsy,
organ and lymph node green fluorescent tumor metastases from necropsies were detected by
the Illumatool Bright Light System (LT-9500) using a 470 nm/40 nm excitation filter
(Lightools Research) and imaged using a Stereomaster 4× dissecting microscope (Fisher
Scientific) with mounted DC290 Zoom digital camera (Eastman Kodak). Images were captured
at the same focal plane in the presence of 480-nm excitation and >490-nm filtered emission
with an exposure time of 4 s for GFP images and 1/10 s for white-light illumination. Image
data were analyzed with ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) by segmenting the green channel
and counting total positive pixels per field.

The effect of NaHCO3 treatment on tumor pH. All in vivo measurements were done at 4.7 T
on a Bruker Biospec magnetic resonance imaging spectrometer equipped with a 14 G/cm selfshielded gradient insert, using volume excitation and home-built solenoid coils for reception.
Image-guided volume-selective 31P magnetic resonance spectra of tumors in anesthetized mice
were acquired as described in ref. 14. The pHe and pHi were measured from the chemical shifts
of exogenous 3-aminopropylphosphonate and endogenous inorganic phosphate, respectively
(17). For spectroscopy of tumors, 0.4 mL of 0.24 mol/L 3-aminopropylphosphonate was
administered i.p. to mice a few minutes before anesthetization. Following anesthetization, a
further 0.4 mL of 3-aminopropylphosphonate was injected i.p., and the mouse prepared
for 31P MRS as before. This figure illustrates representative 31P magnetic resonance spectra
from control (solid) and NaHCO3-treated (dotted) MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts. 3-APP,

Microscopic pH gradients in window chambers. Tumors were inoculated into window chamber
as described in Materials and Methods. pHe was measured following injection of SNARF-1
free acid by excitation with a He/Ne laser at 543 nm and emissions were collected in channel
1 with a 595/50-nm bandpass and in channel 2 with a 640-nm-long pass filter. Confocal images
were converted to .tif format using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/); respective background
images were subtracted from each fluorescence image (red channel, blue channel); and image
was then smoothed with a 2 × 2 kernel. The two images were then divided, subsequently
removing zeros and not-a-numbers (NANs), creating a ratiometric image. The in vitro pH
calibration was then applied to every pixel in the ratiometric image. Regions of interest were
drawn around the tumor, the proximal peritumor region, and the distal “normal” region, and
the mean pHe was calculated in these regions. The spatial pH distribution was calculated by
drawing an intensity profile (5 pixels wide) from the center of the tumor out to the edge of the
window chamber. These profiles were drawn in four orthogonal radial directions, originating
from the tumor centroid. The pH profiles were then aligned so that they coincided at the tumor
margin using the GFP image to determine the tumor rim. Representative pHe images are shown
for untreated (A) and bicarbonate-treated (B) mice (10 × field of view, 12.5 mm). Red lines,
region of interest of tumor, defined by GFP images, shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. C,

and bicarbonate-treated tumors. “0” is centroid of tumor, and vertical line indicates tumor edge.
