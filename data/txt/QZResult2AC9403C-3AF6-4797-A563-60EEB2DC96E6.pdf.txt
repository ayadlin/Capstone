Abstract
The Forkhead box O (FOXO) protein family is an evolutionarily
conserved subclass of transcription factors recently identified
as bona fide tumor suppressors. Preventing the accumulation
of cellular damage due to oxidative stress is thought to
underlie its tumor-suppressive role. Oxidative stress, in turn,
also feedback controls FOXO4 function. Regulation of this
process, however, is poorly understood but may be relevant
to the ability of FOXO to control tumor suppression. Here,
we characterize novel FOXO4 phosphorylation sites after
increased cellular oxidative stress and identify the isomerase
Pin1, a protein frequently found to be overexpressed in cancer,
as a critical regulator of p27kip1 through FOXO4 inhibition. We
show that Pin1 requires these phosphorylation events to act
negatively on FOXO4 transcriptional activity. Consistent with
this, oxidative stress induces binding of Pin1 to FOXO, thereby
attenuating its monoubiquitination, a yet uncharacterized
mode of substrate modulation by Pin1. We have previously
shown that monoubiquitination is involved in controlling nuclear translocation in response to cellular stress, and indeed,
Pin1 prevents nuclear FOXO4 accumulation. Interestingly, Pin1
acts on FOXO through stimulation of the activity of the
deubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP/USP7. Ultimately, this results
in decreased transcriptional activity towards target genes,
including the cell cycle arrest gene p27kip1 . Notably, in a primary human breast cancer panel, low p27kip1 levels inversely
correlated with Pin1 expression. Thus, Pin1 is identified as a
novel negative FOXO regulator, interconnecting FOXO phosphorylation and monoubiquitination in response to cellular
stress to regulate p27kip1. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7597–605]

tide-3-kinase/Akt (PKB) signaling pathway (1, 2). Akt/PKB negatively regulates FOXO activity through direct phosphorylation by
inducing their nuclear exclusion (3). FOXOs play a critical role in
longevity, first shown in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,
which had an extended life span upon deletion of the daf-2/insulin
receptor (reviewed in ref. 4). This requires the FOXO orthologue
daf-16 and is characterized by an increase in stress resistance, consistent with the notion that resistance to cellular stress correlates
with longevity (5).
Stress resistance is also closely related to the onset of age-related
diseases such as cancer (5, 6). Indeed, FOXOs were recently shown
to be tumor suppressors in a number of cancers (1, 7). Mice
depleted for FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 are characterized by the
appearance of thymic lymphomas and hemangiomas (8). Intriguingly, cellular stress in turn, also changes FOXO activity towards its
target genes, thus allowing for an adaptive response to cellular
stress (reviewed in ref. 9). Regulation of this process, however,
is poorly understood but may be relevant to the ability of FOXO
to control tumor suppression.
FOXOs regulate a number of transcriptional targets involved in
stress resistance, survival, and cell proliferation (reviewed in ref. 7).
A key transcriptional FOXO target is the cell cycle arrest gene
p27kip1 (8, 10). The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 is a
haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that regulates the entry of cells
from quiescence to cell cycle through inhibition of CDK2 (11).
Interestingly, activation of FOXO in cells induces cell cycle arrest
and quiescence, involving p130 and p27kip1 expression (12). Reentry into the cell cycle involves down-regulation of p27kip1, a
process that is poorly understood but is thought to involve the
phosphorylation and degradation of p27kip1 (11). In human cancer,
expression of p27kip1 is often found deregulated and numerous
therapies are being developed to restore its function. Localization
defects and degradation are thought to be the main cause of p27kip1
deregulation. However, it was recently shown that p27kip1 levels
in human cancer are transcriptionally regulated as well, albeit
through unknown mechanisms (13).
Regulation of protein activity often involves signaling through
posttranslational modifications. These modifications either induce
a structural change in the protein, thereby altering its activity, or
induces the exposure of sites recognized by regulatory proteins.
Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that specifically recognizes
phosphorylated serines and threonines flanked by a COOHterminal proline residue (14). Pin1-mediated isomerization induces
conformational changes in the peptide backbone. This leads to the
altered function of its protein substrates and has been shown to be
involved in numerous processes, including the regulation of cell
proliferation and death (14). Pin1 is found to be overexpressed in
many human cancers and is linked to tumorigenesis (15).

Here, we identify a novel regulatory pathway for FOXO signaling.
In response to cellular stress, FOXOs are phosphorylated and
recognized by Pin1. Evidence is provided that Pin1 negatively
regulates FOXO monoubiquitination at the level of deubiquitination through HAUSP/USP7. This inhibits nuclear FOXO translocation in response to hydrogen peroxide–induced stress and
ultimately leads to decreased transcription and expression of
FOXO4 transcriptional targets, including p27 kip1 . Notably, in a
panel of primary human breast cancers, we found an inverse correlation between low p27kip1 levels and Pin1 expression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection. HEK293T and A14 cells (3T3 fibroblasts
stably expressing the insulin receptor) were maintained in DMEM
(Cambrex), 10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin and 0.05% glutamine.
Constructs and RNAi. pMT2-HA-FOXO4, pMT2-Flag-FOXO4, pMT2GFP-FOXO4, CMV-p27kip1, His6-Ubi, and pBabePuro have been described
(16). pcDNA-His-Pin1, pcDNA-His-Pin1W34A, pGEX-GST-Pin1, and pGEXGST-Pin1W34A were gifts from Drs. C. Fila and P. van der Sluijs (Department
of Cell Biology, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Pin1 was Flag-tagged NH2-terminally by PCR, using oligonucleotide
sequences to Flag-tag Pin1 ( forward oligonucleotide, 5¶-CCGGATCCATGGACTACAAGGATGACGACGACAAGGCGGACGAGGAGAAGCTG; reverse
oligonucleotide, 5¶-CGAATTCTCACTCAGTCGGAGGATGATG-3¶). PCR
products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned in pcDNA3.1.
Pin1K63A was made by site-directed mutagenesis oligonucleotide
sequences to make K63A mutant to Pin1 ( forward, 5¶-CGTGACTGGCTGTGCGCCACCAGCAGGTGCGA-3¶ and its reverse complement strand).
Nontargeting RNAi duplex (C), RNAi oligonucleotides specific for Pin1
(Pin1 #1: sense, 5¶-GCCAUUUGAAGACGCCUCGdTdT-3¶; Pin1 #2: sense,
5¶-CGUCCUGGCGGCAGGAGAAUUdTdT-3¶) were purchased from Dharmacon. RNAi was transfected with OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Additional cotransfections were performed 8 h after RNAi transfection.
Antibodies. The antibodies against FOXO4 (834) and HA (12CA5) have
been described (10). The following antibodies were purchased: MPM2
(Upstate), FOXO4-phospho-Thr28 (Upstate), Pin1 (R&D systems), p27Kip1
(BD Biosciences), FOXO4-N19, 14-3-3, and glutathione S-transferase (GST;
Santa Cruz), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Chemicon), tubulin, and Flag-M2 (Sigma).
GST pulldown assays, coimmunoprecipitations, and Western blot
analysis. GST proteins were coupled to glutathione agarose beads, washed
twice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [RIPA; 20 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 1% TX-100, 0.5% NaDoC, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
protease and phosphatase inhibitors]. Cells were lysed in RIPA, cleared and
incubated with the glutathione agarose beads for 2 h at 4jC. Subsequently,
beads were washed, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by
Western blotting. Lambda phosphatase was purchased from New England
Biolabs. For coimmunoprecipitation studies, 50 AL of Protein-A Sepharose
beads were precoupled to 1 Ag of the indicated antibody. Cells were lysed in
RIPA or, in the case of endogenous coimmunoprecipitation, in 20 mmol/L of
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L of MgCl2, 1 mmol/L of
EDTA, 150 mmol/L of NaCl, protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and
incubated as described previously (17).
Mass spectrometry. Purified Flag-FOXO4 from hydrogen peroxide–
treated HEK293T cells (200 Amol/L for 1 h) was digested with trypsin,
subtilisin, and/or elastase (Roche). If required, samples were enriched for
phosphorylated peptides using TiO2 microcolumns, as described (18).
Samples were subjected to nanoflow LC (Agilent 1100 series) coupled to a
quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass Waters).
Data were processed and subjected to database searches using MASCOT
software (Matrixscience). The identified peptides were confirmed by
manual interpretation of the spectra.
Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. The expression of endogenous p27Kip1 and Gadd45a genes in A14 cells was examined by reverse
transcription of total RNA followed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR).

on an ABI cycler using Sybr Green (ABI), with oligonucleotides specific to
p27 Kip1, Gadd45a and PBGD oligonucleotides specific for mouse p27 Kip1
( forward, 5¶-CTGGGTTAGCGGAGCACTGT-3¶; reverse, 5¶-GGAAAACAAAACGCTTCTTCTTAG-3¶), mouse Gadd45a ( forward, 5¶-AGACCGAAAGGATGGACACG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-TGACTCCGAGCCTTGCTGA-3¶),
mouse PBGD ( forward, 5¶-GGCAATGCGGCTGCAA-3¶; reverse, 5¶-GGGTACCCACGCGAATCAC-3¶).
Protein stability assay. HEK293T cells were transfected with a CMVdriven p27kip1 construct and/or Pin1. Next, cells were treated with 10 Ag/mL
of cycloheximide for the indicated times. Protein levels were detected and
corrected for GAPDH levels by Odyssee.
Immunohistochemistry. Paraffin blocks containing formaldehyde-fixed
breast cancer tissues were sectioned, deparaffinized, and rehydrated and
stained essentially as described (19) with the primary antibodies for Pin1,
FOXO3a, FOXO4, and p27kip1. These were detected using a poly-Hrp antiMs/Rb/Rt (ImmunoLogic) and developed with diaminobenzidine, followed
by counterstaining with hematoxylin.
Ubiquitination assay. The monoubiquitination assay was performed as
described (16). HEK293T cells were transfected with RNAi oligonucleotides
and/or the indicated constructs. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells
were treated as indicated and lysed in 8 mol/L of urea, 10 mmol/L of TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmol/L of Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.2% TX-100, 5 mmol/L
of NEM, and protease inhibitors. Ubiquitinated proteins were precipitated using Ni-NTA agarose beads and the experiment was analyzed by
Western blotting.
Immunofluorescence. A14 cells were plated and transfected on
coverslips. Immunostaining was performed 40 h after transfection (3).
Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were incubated with anti-FOXO4 (834) or
anti-Pin1, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa488 or goat
anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa568. Nuclei were visualized with
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescence was captured using a Zeiss
Axioskop microscope.

Results
Identification of seven phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro sites on
FOXO4. To better understand the FOXO4 adaptive response under
conditions of cellular stress, a search for posttranslational modifications was initiated on FOXO4 by employing tandem mass
spectrometry (MS). Flag-FOXO4 was purified from hydrogen
peroxide–treated human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells
and subjected to proteolytic digestion. Five novel phosphorylated
sites for FOXO4 were characterized, in addition to the previously
characterized oxidative stress–sensitive phosphorylation sites
Thr447/Thr451 (20), suggesting that at least some of these seven sites
are regulated through oxidative stress signaling (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S1). TiO2 columns, which specifically enrich for phosphorylated peptides (18), were used in MS analysis and confirmed
these sites. In addition, we identified two double-phosphorylated
peptides, Thr447/Thr451 and Thr223/Ser226 (Supplementary Table S1),
indicating that FOXO4 can be multiphosphorylated.
Interestingly, all these sites consisted of phosphorylated Ser/Thr
residues, followed by a Pro residue. These phosphorylated Ser/ThrPro motifs in proteins are potential recognition sequences for
the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1, which has been proposed to
regulate protein function through catalyzed cis-trans isomerization, thereby changing the local structure of its substrates (21). This
prompted us to test the hypothesis that FOXO4 activity may be
regulated by Pin1.
The FOXO4 transcriptional activity on p27kip1 is inhibited by
Pin1. Previously, we have shown that FOXO4 regulates transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor gene p27kip1 (10). Real-time
reverse transcriptase qPCR was performed to test if Pin1 could
affect FOXO4 transcriptional activity. Expression of FOXO4 increased the abundance of p27kip1 mRNA by approximately 3-fold

(Fig. 2A), similar to previous findings (10). Interestingly, coexpression of Pin1 inhibited the FOXO4-induced increase in p27kip1
mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). Pin1 harbors two functional domains, an
NH2-terminal WW domain, involved in substrate interaction (22),
and a COOH-terminal PPIase domain critical for its isomerase
activity (23). The Pin1 mutant Pin1W34A, which fails to bind
phosphorylated substrates (23), no longer inhibited p27kip1
transcription, indicating that the WW domain is required for the
Pin1-mediated p27kip1 down-regulation. Similar results were obtained by using primers specific for the Gadd45a gene (Fig. 2A,
right), another FOXO transcription target (24).
To determine if p27kip1 protein levels change accordingly, FOXO4
was transiently expressed in the absence or presence of Pin1 and
the mutant Pin1W34A. Consistent with the reverse transcriptase
qPCR results and previous data (10), FOXO4 increased p27kip1
protein expression. However, Pin1 coexpression, but not mutant
Pin1W34A, abolished this increase in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2B). Similar results were found for p21 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1), another FOXO4 transcriptional target (25). Aside
from FOXO-regulated transcription of p27kip1, Pin1 could also
affect p27kip1 expression at other posttranscriptional levels. To test
whether Pin1 could also have a direct effect on p27kip1 protein
stability, we determined the p27kip1 half-life time by performing
cycloheximide experiments. Coexpression of Pin1 did not change
the p27kip1 half-life (Fig. 2C), indicating that Pin1 does not affect
p27kip1 protein stability.
Finally, we wanted to address if the regulation of p27kip1 is
mediated by the isomerase activity of Pin1. For this, we coexpressed FOXO4 and a previously described isomerase-defective
Pin1 mutant, Pin1K63A (21). Whereas Pin1 inhibited FOXO4induced p27kip1 expression, this mutant did not (Fig. 2D), indicating that the isomerase activity of Pin1 is required for Pin1-mediated
inhibition of FOXO4 transcriptional activity. Taken together, these

www.aacrjournals.org

results show that Pin1 expression inhibits FOXO4 transcriptional
activity, which is dependent on both the Pin1 substrate interaction
domain and the isomerization domain. This prompted us to test if
Pin1 and FOXO4 physically interact.
Cellular stress induces Pin1 binding to phosphorylated
FOXO4. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldown experiments
were performed to examine if Pin1 could physically interact with
FOXO4. As shown in Fig. 3A, GST-Pin1, but not GST alone,
specifically precipitated FOXO4 from HEK293T cell lysates.
Interestingly, treatment of cells with increasing amounts of
hydrogen peroxide prior to lysis strongly enhanced this interaction
in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to cellular stress
generated by hydrogen peroxide, we tested other stressors as well.
GST pulldown experiments were performed on FOXO4-expressing
cells that were treated with anisomycin, which is known to activate
stress-activated protein kinases (26), doxorubicin and UV, both
used to induce DNA damage. Binding of FOXO4 increased only
when cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide or anisomycin,
indicating specificity for these stressors (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, GST pulldown experiments were performed to test if Pin1
could also interact with FOXO3a, a closely related FOXO family
member. Like FOXO4, FOXO3a was found to bind to Pin1 (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that the interaction is conserved
among the FOXO family members. Moreover, consistent with the
inability to reduce FOXO4 transcriptional activity, the Pin1W34A
mutant, incapable of binding Pin1 substrates, could no longer
interact with FOXO4 and FOXO3a (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S3).
The above experiments indicate that Pin1 interacts with FOXO4 via
its WW domain, an interaction that is enhanced in response to
hydrogen peroxide. As mentioned, Pin1 binding is specific for
phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro sites, of which MS on FOXO4 identified seven. Therefore, we analyzed whether the Pin1-FOXO4
interaction is actually dependent on the phosphorylation of FOXO4

on these sites. Pretreatment of hydrogen peroxide–treated FOXO4
with lambda phosphatase, leading to FOXO4 dephosphorylation as
indicated by the loss of reduced motility in SDS-PAGE, abolished
the ability of FOXO4 to interact with Pin1 (Fig. 3B), indicating that
FOXO4 needs to be phosphorylated for its interaction with Pin1.
Next, we set out to determine which phosphorylated FOXO4 Ser/
Thr-Pro sites are involved in the Pin1-FOXO4 interaction.
Mutational analysis of single phosphorylation sites to Ala residues
did not result in significantly decreased Pin1 binding upon
peroxide stress, indicating that multiple phosphorylation sites are
likely to be involved (data not shown). Further analysis using
combinations of multiple Ala mutations consistently showed that
the Pin1-FOXO4 interaction decreased progressively (data not
shown) and is impaired for the FOXO4 mutant, in which all
putative Pin1 binding sites as identified by MS, are mutated to Ala
and is therefore referred to as FOXO4-7S/TA (Fig. 3C).
Finally, coimmunoprecipitation assays on endogenous FOXO4
and Pin1 in HEK293T cells showed that Pin1 specifically interacts
with FOXO4 in vivo, an interaction that is increased after hydrogen
peroxide–induced stress (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results
show that Pin1 and FOXO4 interact in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is sensitive to cellular stress and is dependent on a functional WW domain of Pin1 as well as phosphorylation of FOXO4.
Pin1 regulates peroxide-induced FOXO4 monoubiquitination and nuclear localization through inhibition of HAUSP/
USP7. Regulation of FOXO activity is often mediated through a
change in cellular distribution. For instance, signaling through
PKB/Akt inactivates FOXO4 through phosphorylation, resulting in
nuclear exclusion (3). Alternatively, increased oxidative stress as

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

generated by hydrogen peroxide results in increased nuclear
localization (17, 27). The observed Pin1-dependent decrease in
FOXO4 transcriptional activity could therefore be the result of a
changed nuclear-cytoplasmic FOXO4 localization. Immunofluorescence of FOXO4 in A14 cells shows that FOXO4 is distributed in
both the cytoplasm and nucleus under normal growth conditions
but is redistributed predominantly to the nucleus when stimulated
with hydrogen peroxide, consistent with previous observations
(Fig. 4A; refs. 17, 27). However, ectopic expression of Pin1 prevented
the redistribution of FOXO4 to the nucleus in response to oxidative
stress. This phenotype depends on the interaction of FOXO4 with
Pin1, as cells coexpressing Pin1W34A do not inhibit FOXO4 relocalization. Furthermore, the FOXO4-7S/TA mutant that is impaired in
binding to Pin1 had a nuclear localization in normal serumcontaining medium (Fig. 4A). Treatment of cells with hydrogen
peroxide and Pin1 coexpression did not change FOXO4-7S/TA
localization (data not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of
these sites is required to retain FOXO4 in the cytoplasm. Taken
together, these results indicate that Pin1 inhibits FOXO4-mediated
transcriptional effects by inhibiting its nuclear localization.
The nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of FOXO factors by growth
factor signaling is regulated through binding of 14-3-3 proteins,
which leads to the export of FOXO in a Ran/Crm1-dependent
manner to the cytoplasm (3). To uncover the mechanism by which
Pin1 regulates FOXO4 localization, the interaction between 14-3-3
and FOXO4 was explored. FOXO4, but not a mutant in which all
three PKB/Akt sites are mutated (FOXO4-A3), could bind 14-3-3
(Fig. 4B; ref. 3). In the presence of Pin1, however, the interaction of
FOXO4 with 14-3-3 is unchanged. Altered 14-3-3 binding therefore,

Pin1 Regulates p27kip1 through FOXO4

could not explain the Pin1-mediated effects observed on FOXO4
localization. Importantly, phosphorylation of FOXO4 on Thr28
which is mediated by PKB/Akt did not change upon Pin1
expression, indicating that Pin1 does not affect PKB-mediated
FOXO4 signaling.
Recently, we have shown that FOXO4 can be monoubiquitinated
in response to oxidative stress, a process that is reversed by the
deubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP/USP7 (16). Monoubiquitination
of proteins is a distinct modification leading to a change in cellular
localization/signaling, clearly different from polyubiquitination
that leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of protein
substrates (28, 29). Indeed, monoubiquitinated FOXO4 leads to
nuclear localization of FOXO4 independent of protein turnover
(16). As shown in (Fig. 4C), low amounts of hydrogen peroxide
induce FOXO4 monoubiquitination. However, expression of Pin1
completely inhibits hydrogen peroxide–induced FOXO4 monoubiquitination. Because HAUSP/USP7 is the enzyme responsible for
deubiquitinating FOXO4, we tested if the Pin1 binding impaired
mutant FOXO4-7S/TA mutant, could still be deubiquitinated by
USP7. Surprisingly, whereas USP7 can efficiently and completely
deubiquitinate FOXO4, deubiquitination is impaired for FOXO4-7S/
TA (Fig. 4D). This observation suggests that USP7-mediated
deubiquitination on FOXO4 is in part dependent of Pin1. USP7mediated deubiquitination of FOXO4 involves binding of USP7 to
FOXO4. Therefore, we tested whether FOXO4-7S/TA still binds
to USP7. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, USP7 was found to
interact equally well with both FOXO4 and FOXO4-7S/TA
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Because FOXO4-7S/TA shows strongly
impaired binding to Pin1, this result suggests that Pin1 enhances

substrate, i.e., monoubiquitinated FOXO4 recognition of USP7.
This also explains the small amount of FOXO4-7S/TA deubiquitination because USP7 still interacts with FOXO4. Together, these
results show that Pin1 prevents hydrogen peroxide–induced
FOXO4 nuclear localization and this likely results from the ability
of Pin1 to inhibit hydrogen peroxide–induced FOXO4 monoubiquitination through stimulation of HAUSP/USP7-mediated FOXO4
deubiquitination.
Pin1 regulates p27kip1 through FOXO4. FOXOs are known
regulators of p27kip1 expression, which as shown here, can be
inhibited by Pin1. However, to our knowledge, Pin1 has not been
described to affect p27kip1 expression. Therefore, we wished to
address the role of endogenous Pin1 in regulating p27kip1 expression. To this end, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides against Pin1. Knockdown of Pin1 by two independent
siRNAs increased the expression of p27kip1 protein, in agreement
with the role of Pin1 in p27kip1 regulation and also in agreement
with Pin1 acting as a negative regulator of FOXO (Fig. 5A). To
exclude the possibility that the observed increase in p27kip1
expression is the result of off-target knockdown, we generated a
siRNAi-insensitive Pin1 construct by introducing a silent mutation
in the RNAi recognition sequence of oligonucleotide no. 1 (Pin1SM). Expression of this mutant in a Pin1 RNAi #1 background
significantly rescued the RNAi-induced p27kip1 protein levels,
indicating that the observed effects are specific for Pin1 (Fig. 5A,
right). These results indicate that depletion of Pin1 increases
p27kip1 expression in vivo. FOXO4-Thr28 phosphorylation did not
change upon Pin1 depletion, consistent with the notion that Pin1
does not affect PKB-mediated FOXO4 signaling.

stress. A14 cells were transfected and left untreated or treated as indicated, after which cells were fixed and stained. Transfected cells were used to score the
localization of FOXO4. Columns, mean of two independent experiments performed in triplicate; bars, SE. The significance of changes as compared with FOXO4 only
was confirmed by t test (**, P < 0.005). B, Pin1 does not change 14-3-3 binding to FOXO4. HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-FOXO4 or HA-FOXO4-A3,
a FOXO4 mutant that can no longer bind 14-3-3. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated as indicated, lysed, and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation.
C, Pin1 negatively regulates FOXO4 monoubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected and treated as indicated with 50 Amol/L of H2O2 for 15 min, lysed, and
analyzed for ubiquitinated FOXO4 (Ub-FOXO4). D, USP7-mediated deubiquitination of FOXO-7S/TA is reduced. HEK293T cells were transfected with His6-Ubi,
HA-FOXO4, or HA-FOXO4-7S/TA or Myc-USP7 and analyzed as in C .

As shown above, Pin1 overexpression reduces FOXO monoubiquitination and consequent nuclear translocation. To further
establish whether endogenous Pin1 can regulate FOXO monoubiquitination, we analyzed ubiquitination of FOXO4 after siRNA
against Pin1. Indeed, knockdown of Pin1 increased FOXO4
monoubiquitination (Fig. 5B). Thus, p27kip1 regulation after Pin1
knockdown correlates with regulation of FOXO4 activity through
monoubiquitination. Next, immunofluorescence experiments
were performed to test if endogenous Pin1 also affects FOXO4
localization. Knockdown of Pin1 resulted in increased FOXO4
nuclear localization (Fig. 5C), consistent with the observations
that FOXO4 monoubiquitination and transcriptional activity are
increased upon Pin1 depletion. Because of technical reasons,

we were unable to perform double Pin1/FOXO knockdown experiments. Therefore, we used the FOXO4-7S/TA mutant defective in
Pin1 binding to test if the effects of Pin1 on p27kip1 are mediated
through FOXO. FOXO4-7S/TA was able to induce p27kip1 protein
expression, indicating that these phosphorylation sites are not
required for FOXO4 transcriptional activity per se (Fig. 5D).
Importantly, whereas FOXO4-induced p27 kip1 expression is
inhibited, Pin1 no longer inhibited FOXO4-7S/TA–induced p27kip1
expression. Taken together, these results provide evidence that
Pin1 regulates p27kip1 expression through regulation of FOXO.

breast and prostate cancers, are characterized by high expression

of Pin1 (30). Moreover, Pin1 contributes to oncogenic transformation as, for instance, Pin1 is essential for the transformation of
mammary epithelial cells induced by Neu/Ras (31). Loss of p27kip1
expression is also often found in many human cancers and
correlates with poor survival (32, 33). This prompted us to
determine if p27kip1 expression correlates with Pin1 levels in
human cancer. We had access to a panel of 100 human invasive
ductal breast cancer tumors and stained them for p27kip1 and Pin1.
In agreement with previously published work, Pin1 was found to be
overexpressed to various degrees in the majority of tumors (n = 77/
100), as compared with normal ductal breast tissue, in which only
weak staining of Pin1 was found (ref. 34 and Supplementary
Fig. S5). We also stained for FOXO3 and FOXO4 and found no
changes in expression staining, indicating that FOXO expression is
not affected in our set of tumors (data not shown).
Expression of p27kip1 was highly variable, varying from a
complete loss to a staining comparable with normal breast tissue
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Because loss of p27kip1 is highly correlated
with tumorigenesis and poor prognostic outcome, we divided the
tumors into two distinct groups; one with normal p27kip1 levels
(defined as tumors with stronger staining than the statistical
median, n = 61/100) and one with low p27kip1 levels (n = 39/100). In
the population with low p27kip1 expression, a significant inverse
correlation with Pin1 expression was found (P < 0.01, r = 0.42
Spearman correlation test, two-tailed). Importantly, this observation
unlikely represents an artifact of Pin1 overexpression in the majority
of tumors because we observed no correlation with the high p27kip1–
expressing group (Table 1). These results support the notion that
Pin1 is important in p27kip1 regulation and extends our observations
to human breast cancer.

Discussion
Here, we provide evidence that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase
Pin1 acts as a negative regulator of FOXO transcriptional activity.
Pin1, through its WW domain, binds FOXO directly in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, Pin1 regulation of FOXO requires, next to binding, the isomerase activity
of Pin1. This indicates that Pin1-induced conformational changes
within FOXO underlie the regulatory action of Pin1. Previously,
it had been suggested that Pin1 catalyzes the dephosphorylation

of the phosphorylated threonine/serine residues involved in
Pin1 binding (14). Thus, Pin1-induced isomerization is thought
to facilitate access of phosphatases like PP2A to the phosphorylated threonine/serine residues. Using phosphospecific antibodies against the PKB phosphorylation sites and phosphospecific
antibodies against the sites identified in this study, we were unable to obtain any conclusive evidence that Pin1 binding to FOXO4
resulted in the dephosphorylation of these sites. In contrast, we
observed that Pin1 binding to FOXO4 regulates its monoubiquitination. Previous studies have indicated that Pin1 can modulate polyubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation of
substrates with a short-lifetime, such as Myc, p53, p73, and hcatenin (reviewed in ref. 14). However, FOXOs are relatively stable
proteins and monoubiquitination, in contrast, does not lead
to proteasome-mediated degradation but instead often results
in changes in signaling and subcellular localization (28, 29).
Indeed, monoubiquitination of FOXO4 leads to nuclear localization and increased transcriptional activity but does not affect
FOXO stability (16). Deubiquitination of FOXO4 is mediated by
HAUSP/USP7 and similar to phosphatases, deubiquitinating
enzymes such as USP7 require a cysteine within their catalytic
activity to remove the ubiquitin moiety. We provide evidence
that Pin1 increases USP7-mediated FOXO4 deubiquitination,
which at least in part leads to decreased FOXO4 monoubiquitination. Thus, analogous to its role in regulating phosphatase activity towards its substrates, Pin1 may also regulate the activity of
USP7 towards FOXO4. Nevertheless, Pin1-mediated attenuation
of monoubiquitination represents, to the best of our knowledge, a

RNAi oligonucleotides (C ), or Pin1 RNAi oligonucleotides (#1 or #2) or in combination with pBabePuro, EV, or the Pin1 RNAi-silent mutant (Flag-Pin1-SM; right ).
Cell lysates were detected for p27Kip1 and Pin1 expression by Western blotting. B, knockdown of Pin1 increases FOXO4 monoubiquitination. HEK293T cells were
treated with the indicated RNAi oligonucleotides and were subsequently cotransfected with His6-Ubi and HA-FOXO4. A ubiquitination assay was performed.
C, knockdown of Pin1 increases FOXO4 nuclear localization. A14 cells were transfected with GFP-FOXO4 and control or Pin1 RNAi #1. Transfected cells were scored
for FOXO4 localization. D, Pin1 inhibits p27kip1 expression through FOXO4. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pBabePuro, EV, HA-FOXO4, HA-FOXO4-7S/TA,
and/or Flag-Pin1. Cells were selected with puromycin for 48 h.

previously uncharacterized mechanism of Pin1 substrate activity regulation.
Previously, we have shown that p27kip1 is a key transcriptional
FOXO target gene in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and
quiescence (10, 12), a notion that was recently supported by in vivo
experiments (8). To maintain cell cycle arrest, FOXOs increase the
cellular antioxidant capacity by up-regulating genes like MnSOD
and catalase (9). In turn, increased cellular oxidative stress activates FOXOs, thereby creating a feedback loop that can prevent
excessive cellular oxidative stress. Recent studies on conditional
FoxO1/3/4 knockout mice underscore the critical importance of
oxidative stress management by FOXOs in the hematopoietic stem
cell compartment in keeping stem cells quiescent (35). Deletion of
all three FOXO genes in hematopoietic stem cells results in stem
cell depletion due to increased proliferation and concomitant
increased intracellular levels of oxidative stress. Thus, FOXOs are
important players in cellular oxidative stress management, and
as such, it is of importance to understand how cellular oxidative
stress impinges on FOXO. Under conditions of cellular stress, FOXO
is phosphorylated, and here, we identified several novel sites of
phosphorylation, which we show are involved in Pin1 binding after
hydrogen peroxide treatment. Therefore, regulation of FOXO
activity through Pin1 could present a novel mechanism of how
cells re-enter the cell cycle from a quiescent state especially in
response to cellular stress. In this respect, it is interesting to note
that embryonic fibroblasts derived from Pin1 knockout mice show
defective G0-G1 entry (36). In line with this, we observe that
knockdown of Pin1 increases p27kip1 expression.
In contrast, overexpression of Pin1 inhibits FOXO4-induced
p27kip1 expression. p27 kip1 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor
gene and decreased p27kip1 expression can result in loss of cell
cycle control, a hallmark of carcinogenesis (37). Loss of p27kip1 is

prevalent in human cancer and correlates with poor survival (33).
Unlike loss of, for instance, the tumor suppressor p53, p27kip1
function is lost because of a transcriptional or posttranslational
down-regulation rather than a genetic defect (11, 13). Moreover,
it has been shown that Pin1 is overexpressed in numerous cancer
tissues, notably in breast cancer and prostate cancer, and
contributes to the malignant transformation of cancer cells (15).
The significance of our data, in which Pin1 inhibits p27kip1
expression is underscored by our findings in human breast cancers,
where we find that loss of p27kip1 expression strongly correlates
with high Pin1 expression. Thus, in some percentage of tumors,
loss of p27kip1 may result from increased Pin1 expression inhibiting FOXO function. Reconstitution of nuclear FOXO activity has
been shown to arrest both normal and transformed cells in G1,
to inhibit soft agar growth, and to inhibit xenograft growth in
nude mice (38, 39). Disruption of the Pin1-FOXO interaction aimed
at increasing the nuclear FOXO pool and restoring p27kip1 transcription could therefore represent a potential therapeutic point
for intervention.
