BACKGROUND. This randomized, noncomparative, multicenter, clinical trial evaluated ixabepilone or mitoxantrone/prednisone (MP) as second-line chemotherapy
for taxane-refractory, hormone-refractory, prostate cancer (HRPC).

METHODS. Patients with HRPC that progressed during or within 60 days of cessation of taxane chemotherapy were randomly selected with equal probability to
ixabepilone 35 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks, or mitoxantrone 14 mg/m2
intravenously every 3 weeks and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Treatment
continued until progression or toxicity; crossover was allowed.

RESULTS. Forty-one patients were accrued to each arm of the study. The median
number of cycles administered for each arm was 3. Median survival from protocol
entry was 10.4 months with ixabepilone and 9.8 months with MP. Prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) declines of 50% were observed in 17% of ixabepilone (95% CI, 7-32)
and 20% of second-line MP patients (95% CI, 9-35). Partial responses were observed
in 1 of 24 ixabepilone and in 2 of 21 MP patients with evaluable measurable disease.
Median duration of second-line ixabepilone and MP treatment was 2.2 months and

3

2.3 months, respectively. For third-line crossover treatment, PSA declines of 50%

were observed in 3 of 27 ixabepilone-treated and 4 of 15 MP-treated patients. Prior
taxane response was associated with an increased likelihood of second-line ixabepi-

lone or MP response. Low baseline lactate dehydrogenase and absence of visceral
metastases independently predicted improved survival. The most common grade
3/4 toxicity associated with second-line treatment was neutropenia (54% of ixabepilone patients and 63% of MP patients).

CONCLUSIONS. Ixabepilone and MP had modest activity as second-line chemotherapy
for docetaxel-refractory HRPC. The median survival for the entire cohort treated in this
study was 9.8 months. Cancer 2007;110:556–63.  2007 American Cancer Society.

Second-line chemotherapy for HRPC/Rosenberg et al.

Nearly all HRPC patients eventually progress during
or after taxane-based treatment. Many patients have a
good performance status and wish additional treatment. No standard chemotherapy exists for secondline treatment of patients with HRPC after progression
on taxane-based therapies, although the community
de facto standard has become MP.
The natural history of taxane-refractory (TR)
HRPC has not been prospectively defined. Although
second-line chemotherapy trials have been reported
in HRPC, these trials are difficult to interpret because
of heterogeneity of patient populations. Most importantly, those trials did not restrict enrollment to
overtly TR-HRPC.
Resistance to taxanes appears mediated by tubulin mutation and multidrug resistant (MDR) gene overexpression. The epothilones are a new class of nontaxane
tubulin polymerization agents whose cytotoxic activity
has been linked to stabilization of microtubules, bypassing known taxane-resistant mechanisms.3,4 Ixabepilone
(Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) is a semisynthetic
analog of epothilone B that blocks the mitotic phase of
the cell cycle. It is a highly potent cytotoxin, and preclinical data demonstrate noncross-resistance with taxanes.
Ixabepilone has demonstrated antitumor activity as firstline chemotherapy in patients with metastatic HRPC.5,6
The preclinical data indicating noncross-resistance of ixabepilone with taxanes, the front-line activity of ixabepilone in HRPC, and the lack of
prospective data regarding MP as second-line chemotherapy provided the rationale for a randomized, noncomparative, phase 2 study in TR-HRPC. This study
randomly assigned patients with TR-HRPC to either
single-agent ixabepilone or the perceived community
standard, MP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This study was a multicenter, randomized, noncomparative phase 2 study. Patients were randomly
assigned with equal probability to either MP or ixabepilone. The primary endpoint was the frequency of
50% PSA declines with each second-line regimen.
Secondary endpoints included safety, response duration, time to progressive disease, third-line (postcrossover) activity of each regimen, and overall
survival.
Eligibility Criteria
All patients had histologically confirmed metastatic
prostate cancer. Patients were required to have progressive disease despite castrate testosterone levels
and at least 2 cycles of taxane-based chemotherapy,

557

with disease progression documented during or
within 60 days of completing taxane-based chemotherapy. For patients with measurable disease, progression was defined by RECIST criteria.7 For
patients without measurable disease, a positive bone
scan and elevated PSA greater than 5 ng/mL were
required. PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer was defined by Consensus Criteria.8
All patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 and grade 1 neuropathy (Common
Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0). Hormonal therapy
other than luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
(LHRH) agonists was not allowed within 4 weeks of
trial enrollment (6 weeks for bicalutamide or nilutamide). Treatment with a corticosteroid as part of
first-line chemotherapy was discontinued over 10–14
days before enrollment. Any radiation therapy or radiopharmaceutical treatment must have been completed more than 4 weeks and 8 weeks before
enrollment, respectively. All patients were required to
have a cardiac ejection fraction greater than the
institutional lower limit of normal. Patients were
excluded for significant cardiovascular disease
including congestive heart failure (New York Heart
Association [NYHA] class III or IV), active angina
pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 6 months
before enrollment. Patients with known active brain
metastases were excluded. Required laboratory
values included testosterone \50 ng/dL; creatinine
\1.5 3 upper limits of normal (ULN) or calculated
creatinine clearance [40 mL/min; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST)
\3 3 ULN; granulocytes [1500/mm3; platelets
100,000/mm3; total bilirubin \1.5 3 ULN; and, if
no measurable disease, a PSA 5 ng/mL.
This clinical trial was sponsored by the Cancer
Therapy Evaluation Program of the National Cancer
Institute and approved by the review boards of each
participating institution. All patients provided written
informed consent.

Randomization and Treatment Plan
Eligible patients were randomly selected by the coordinating center statistician with equal probability to
receive either ixabepilone or MP. Allocation to a
treatment arm was concealed until the patient was
enrolled. Patients were stratified by performance
score (0 vs 1-2) and study site, and they were randomly assigned from within each stratum. Treatment
assignment was balanced after every 4 patients
within each stratum.
Ixabepilone 35 mg/m2 was administered intravenously over 3 hours every 21 days. Patients were

premedicated with H1- and H2-blockers before ixabepilone infusion to prevent hypersensitivity reactions related to Cremophor EL diluent (BASF Group,
Ludwigshafen, Germany) Corticosteroids were used
with subsequent cycles for prior grade 2-4 hypersensitivity reactions to ixabepilone. Mitoxantrone
14 mg/m2 was administered intravenously every 21
days with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Treatment for all patients was continued until disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Myeloid growth factors were administered according to
American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
guidelines.9 Patients underwent imaging with chest
s-ray, bone scan, and computed tomography (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen
and pelvis at baseline and after every 3 cycles.
Electrocardiogram and multiple gated-acquisition
(MUGA) scan or echocardiogram were obtained at
baseline and repeated every 3 cycles for MP patients.
Imaging studies were obtained at the time of crossover.

Dose Modifications
Dose modifications were made according to maximal
toxicity. Doses were reduced for Day 1 neutrophil
count \1500/m3 or platelet count \100,000/m3,
grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia lasting for more than 7 days, grade 4 neutropenia
and fever, and nadir platelet count \25,000. Ixabepilone dose was reduced by 5 mg/m2, and mitoxantrone dose was reduced by 2 mg/m2 for each dose
reduction. Grade 2 neurotoxicity of any duration and
grade 3 neurotoxicity lasting 7 days required dose
reduction. Recurrent grade 3 neurotoxicity, grade 3
neurotoxicity of [7 days duration, or grade 4 neurotoxicity required discontinuation of treatment.
Patients were removed from protocol therapy for a
treatment delay greater than 3 weeks or recurrence
of the same grade 3 toxicities despite 2 dose reductions.
Crossover Therapy
Patients who progressed after at least 2 cycles of protocol treatment or who stopped treatment for toxicity
or other medical reasons were eligible to receive the
alternate treatment. For patients initially treated with
MP, prednisone was tapered over 10–14 days before
starting ixabepilone.
Statistical Considerations
This was a noncomparative randomized phase 2
study to assess safety and efficacy of 2 treatment
regimens, ixabepilone and MP, as second-line ther-

apy for metastatic TR-HRPC patients. The primary
endpoint was the frequency of PSA declines 50%
with second-line therapy, confirmed with 2 consecutive measurements. Response to therapy was
determined for each patient by using PSA declines
for nonmeasurable disease, and RECIST criteria for
measurable disease, bone scans, and nontarget
lesions.7,8 For each treatment arm, a 50% PSA
decline in at least 25% of patients was considered
promising and worthy of further investigation.
Accrual of 40 patients to each treatment arm was
sufficient to detect a 25% response proportion compared with a null hypothesis of 10%. A statistical
level of significance of 0.04 for a directional test and
power of 0.82 was assumed to test this hypothesis.
Secondary endpoints included response duration,
time to PSA progression, overall survival, frequency
of toxicity, and frequency of response to third-line
(crossover) treatment.
Comparability of the 2 treatment subsets was
evaluated by using Fisher exact test for categorical
variables (eg, Gleason score), Student t test for continuous variables (eg, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]),
and the Mann-Whitney test for distributions (eg,
PSA). The effect of prior taxane response on secondline treatment response was analyzed by using the
Mantel-Haenszel tests of association and homogeneity stratified by the second-line therapy.10 Duration
of time to progression and overall survival were calculated from the start of second-line therapy with
the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.11 Comparisons of a difference in distributions between subsets
were performed by using the log-rank test.12 Cox
proportional hazard model was used to identify independent disease features of overall survival for the
entire sample.13 Variables predictive of overall survival based on the log-rank test were considered in
building a model. A forward stepwise approach was
used with the likelihood ratio test to determine significant independent predictors of survival.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Disposition
Between February 2003 and June 2005, 86 patients
were entered at 6 participating centers. Four patients
who never started protocol therapy were not
included in the analysis, thus 82 patients were evaluable. Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to
each treatment arm (Fig. 1). Patient baseline characteristics are detailed in Table 1. Both arms were
balanced. All patients who received any protocol
chemotherapy were included in evaluations of
response and toxicity.

therapy). Treatment with MP was discontinued in 4
patients for toxicity and in 36 patients for disease
progression (28 for PSA progression, 6 for objective
progression, 2 for both PSA and objective progression). One MP patient died on study of unrelated
causes.

Response
Of 41 patients treated with second-line ixabepilone, 7
had a confirmed 50% PSA decline (17%; 95% CI, 732; Table 2). One additional patient had an unconfirmed 50% PSA decline. The median time to a
50% PSA decline was 6 weeks (range, 3–14 weeks).
Twenty-four patients treated with at least 2 cycles of
second-line ixabepilone had measurable disease,
and, of these, 1 (4%) patient had an objective partial
response in addition to a PSA response. The median
time to PSA progression on ixabepilone was 2.2
months, and the median duration of response was
3.8 months (range, 2.8–22.3 months). Three confirmed responders discontinued treatment for toxicity (motor neuropathy, atrial arrhythmia, and grade 2
infusion-site reaction), and 4 confirmed responders
discontinued because of progressive disease.
Of the 41 patients treated with second-line MP, 8
had a confirmed 50% PSA decline (20%; 95% CI, 935; Table 2). For responders, the median time to a
50% PSA decline was 7 weeks (range, 3–19 weeks).
Twenty-one patients treated with at least 2 cycles of
second-line MP had measurable disease, and, of
these, 2 (10%) patients had an objective partial
response, 1 of whom also had a PSA response. The
median time to PSA progression on MP was 2.3
months, and the median duration of PSA response for
responders was 5.9 months (range, 2.7–8.2 months).

ria v2.0 in 2 patients; thrombocytopenia occurred in 1
patient), 4 discontinued for progressive disease, and 1
died without disease progression.
An exploratory analysis of the impact of initial
response to front-line taxane-based therapy on
response to second-line therapy was performed. Stratified by second-line treatment, there was a significantly greater response to second-line therapy
among patients who previously responded to taxane
therapy (Mantel-Haenszel test: P 5 .0004).10 The
association was similar for both second-line treatment groups (test of homogeneity: P 5 0.87). Among
patients with a prior PSA response to taxane chemotherapy, 36% (5 of 14; 95% CI, 13-65) responded to
ixabepilone and 35% (7 of 20; 95% CI, 5-59)
responded to MP. In patients without prior PSA
response to taxane-chemotherapy, 4% (1 of 26; 95%
CI, 0-20) of patients responded to ixabepilone, and
5% (1 of 21; 95% CI, 0-24) responded to MP.

Survival
Evaluation of survival by treatment is complicated by
the finding that 56% of patients received the alternate therapy on crossover. However, the median survival for each arm was 10.4 months for ixabepilone
and 9.8 months for MP. (Fig. 2) The median overall
survival for the entire study was 9.8 months., and did
not show differences based on prior taxane response.
Potential disease features predictive of survival
from the start of second-line therapy were evaluated
in patients enrolled on this study in an exploratory
analysis. When the entire study sample was dichotomized at the median baseline value, a significantly
prolonged survival was observed for decreased LDH
(270 vs [270), decreased alkaline phosphatase
(130 vs [130) and increased hemoglobin (12
vs [12) (P 5 .007, .003, and .01, respectively).

The 3 laboratory parameters were highly correlated
(P < .002 for all pairwise comparisons). Patients without visceral disease also achieved a significantly longer
survival (P 5 .02). Categorized LDH (270 vs >270)
was highly associated with visceral disease (P 5 .005).
There was no difference in survival due to baseline
performance score, PSA, or Gleason score. When the
4 individual parameters significant to predicting survival were considered simultaneously by using Cox
proportional hazard model, a decreased LDH and absence of visceral metastases emerged as significant
independent predictors of prolonged survival (likelihood ratio test, P 5 .0003, .04, respectively).

Toxicity
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 54% and 63%
of patients treated with second-line ixabepilone and
MP, respectively (Table 3). Febrile neutropenia and
neutropenic infection occurred in 4 patients treated
with second-line MP and 3 patients treated with second-line ixabepilone (including 1 patient who died
from neutropenic sepsis). Treatment-related nonhematologic toxicities observed in 5% of patients treated with second-line ixabepilone included anorexia,
stomatitis, fatigue, muscle weakness, and prolonged
prothrombin time (Table 4). Treatment-related nonhematologic toxicity observed in 5% of patients
treated with second-line MP included prolonged prothrombin times and liver function abnormalities.

2 cycles of therapy demonstrated both an objective
and a PSA response.
None of the patients who achieved a PSA response
to third-line therapy demonstrated a PSA response to
second-line treatment. None of the patients who
responded to third-line ixabepilone and only 1 patient
who responded to third-line MP had achieved a previous response to front-line taxane chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
This study evaluated second-line chemotherapy in
TR-HRPC patients to address the question of clinical
cross-resistance between taxanes, epothilones, and
mitoxantrone, as well as to explore the natural history of chemotherapy-refractory HRPC. MP is the de
facto community standard second-line chemotherapy
for HRPC in the absence of prospective data in this
setting. Therefore, determining the activity of second-line MP is important not only to understand the
usefulness of this regimen as second-line chemotherapy but also to define its activity as a control arm for
future second-line clinical trials. Encouraging preclinical activity in taxane-resistant model systems and
substantial activity seen in front-line HRPC chemotherapy support the testing of ixabepilone in the
second-line setting.
The median survival for patients with TR-HRPC
has not been prospectively evaluated. In the present
multicenter study, the median survival of all patients
was 9.8 months from the initiation of second-line
chemotherapy. As study treatments demonstrated only
modest activity in this setting, this value provides a
useful estimate of survival as a baseline for development of future clinical trials in this patient population.
Treatment of TR-HRPC with MP or ixabepilone
demonstrated only modest activity. The PSA response
proportions for MP and ixabepilone were 20% and

17%, respectively. Objective responses were infrequent (10% each arm). Although this study was not
designed to compare the 2 regimens, the levels of activity in this study appear similar between the 2
arms. The anticancer activity of ixabepilone as measured by PSA declines and objective tumor responses
contrasts with results of chemotherapy-naive HRPC
trials with this drug. Although 17% of patients did experience PSA responses to ixabepilone in this study,
this level of activity is not sufficient to justify further
evaluation of ixabepilone in this dose and schedule
as single-agent second-line HRPC chemotherapy.
Although patients were required to have progressive disease during or shortly after stopping taxane
chemotherapy, 35% of ixabepilone and 49% of MP
patients previously experienced a 50% PSA decline
to first-line taxane therapy. A retrospective analysis
demonstrated that patients who experienced a PSA
response to prior therapy were 7-fold to 8-fold more
likely to respond to either second-line regimen. On
the basis of these findings, future randomized studies
should stratify patients for best response to prior
therapy. In addition, patients who never responded
to taxane-based therapy are unlikely to respond to
ixabepilone or MP, and investigational therapy should
be considered. In an exploratory analysis, elevated
LDH and the presence of visceral metastases appear
to be independent prognostic indicators of poor
overall survival in the second-line setting. These indicators should be investigated further in future second-line chemotherapy studies.
The predominant toxicities seen were hematologic in nature. MP was well tolerated, with only 1
episode of neutropenic infection. Ixabepilone treatment resulted in 1 treatment-related death from
neutropenic sepsis during Cycle 1. Although nonhematologic toxicities were seen with ixabepilone, none
were observed with high frequency, and no single
toxicity predominated. Low rates of neurotoxicity
seen in this study compared with other trials of ixabepilone may in part be explained by the requirement that all patients enrolled were required to have
grade 1 neuropathy after taxane chemotherapy.
This requirement may have selected a population
less susceptible to neuropathy.
Previously, the noncross-resistance of taxanes
and ixabepilone was reported in a retrospective analysis of patients treated on a randomized phase 2 trial
of first-line ixabepilone with or without estramustine.14 In that analysis of 49 patients, 51% of patients
treated with second-line taxane achieved a 50%
PSA decline. The results of the current study suggest
there may be a sequence-dependent effect of epothilone and that taxane therapy that may be responsible

for the lower level of activity seen with second-line
ixabepilone.
In the present study, some patients who experienced disease progression on either MP or ixabepilone
and crossed over to the third-line therapy achieved
third-line PSA responses. In fact, none of the patients
who responded to their third-line treatment responded
to their second-line therapy. This implies some noncross-resistance between the 2 regimens.
Although substantial progress in treating HRPC has
been achieved with the introduction of effective firstline chemotherapy, the identification of new agents with
high activity in front-line and TR-HRPC patients
remains a priority. Median survival of patients with TRprostate cancer from the start of second-line chemotherapy remains short. Both novel biologic agents as
well as novel chemotherapies must continue to be
investigated to improve survival in this patient population. Stratification by prior treatment response should
be incorporated into future randomized clinical trials.
