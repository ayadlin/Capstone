BACKGROUND. The optimal trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen for HER2overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer is not known. The trastuzumab and
vinorelbine or taxane (TRAVIOTA) study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial that was designed to compare these regimens.

METHODS. Eligible patients had HER2-overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer
and had received no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either trastuzumab with weekly vinorelbine therapy or
weekly taxane therapy (paclitaxel or docetaxel at the investigator’s choice). Originally planned for 250 patients, the study was closed because of poor accrual

RESULTS. Response rates were 51% and 40% for the vinorelbine/trastuzumab arm
median time to disease progression was 8.5 months and 6.0 months for the
vinorelbine- and taxane-based arms, respectively (log-rank test; P 5 .09). Treatment with either regimen generally was well tolerated, yielding comparable rates
of neurologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Vinorelbine-based treatment was associated with more anemia and neutropenia and with 2 episodes of cardiotoxicity.
Taxane-based therapy was associated with more dermatologic toxicity, myalgias,
and fluid retention.

CONCLUSIONS. Both vinorelbine/trastuzumab and taxane/trastuzumab treatments
were active as first-line therapy for HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer and
had comparable rates of efficacy and tolerability. The toxicities observed were the
result of recognized side effects associated with each of the chemotherapy agents
and schedules. These data can inform treatment decision making in this clinical
setting. Cancer 2007;110:965–72.  2007 American Cancer Society.

Combination regimens have been developed based on preclinical
models that suggest synergy between trastuzumab and certain
chemotherapy regimens3 and based on empiric observations. Phase
II and III trials have demonstrated the activity and safety of trastuzumab administered with taxane-based chemotherapy, including
weekly taxane treatment,1,2,4–7 as well as vinorelbine,8,9 platinum
salts,10 and a variety of other combinations. To date, the optimal

disclosed that concurrent anthracycline-based chemotherapy and trastuzumab was associated with an
unacceptably high risk of cardiomyopathy.11 Few
randomized trials have directly compared 1 trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen with another.
Those limited studies have focused on the question
of adding platinum-based chemotherapy to taxane
treatment.12,13 Aside from these randomized studies—which have generated conflicting data regarding whether the addition of platinum chemotherapy
yields clinically significant improvement—only indirect comparisons from Phase II or III trial results have
been available to guide clinicians and patients in
their choice of treatment regimen.14
We sought to compare 2 widely used treatment
regimens—trastuzumab with weekly taxane therapy
or trastuzumab with weekly vinorelbine therapy.
Based on extensive Phase II data, both types of regimens are endorsed by guideline panels as appropriate first-line treatment regimens,15 and neither
regimen has been associated with prohibitive rates of
cardiotoxicity. The trastuzumab and vinorelbine or
taxane (TRAVIOTA) study was a multicenter, randomized trial that was intended to determine whether
clinically important differences in efficacy or tolerability existed between these regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protection of Participating Patients
All patients provided written informed consent for
trial participation. The protocol was approved by
the institutional review board at each participating
site. An independent data and safety monitoring
board reviewed accrual, toxicity, and efficacy data.
The study was open to accrual from September
2001 to December 2003.
Eligibility
Eligible patients had metastatic breast cancer with
measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)16 and
tumors that overexpressed HER2 (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 31 overexpression and/or positive
fluorescence in situ hybridization results), as determined by local pathology practice. Patients could
have
received
prior
adjuvant
chemotherapy
(including taxane- or vinorelbine-containing regimens) as long as chemotherapy was received 6
weeks prior to study entry. Patients could have
received adjuvant trastuzumab if the last dose was
received 12 months before study entry and if trastuzumab had not been given concurrently with taxane or vinorelbine chemotherapy. Neither prior

chemotherapy nor trastuzumab for metastatic breast
cancer were permitted. Patients were required to
have a life expectancy > 6 months, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status from 0
to 2, an absolute neutrophil count 500/mm3, platelets 100,000/mm3, bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level 115 U/L, creatinine 2.0 mg/dL,
glucose < 200 mg/dL, and a left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) 50%. Patients who were pregnant,
had a history of grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions to any
of the study agents, or had a history of known brain
metastases, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, or preexisting neuropathy in excess of grade 1 were ineligible
along with patients who had an uncontrolled, intercurrent illness or a history of other nonbreast malignancy (except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
nonmelanoma skin cancer). Patients could not be
taking macrolide antibiotics, ketoconazole, antiretroviral therapy, or other investigational agents at the
time of the study. In April 2003, the protocol was
amended to allow patients who had received prior
chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer if none of
the study drugs had been given, if prior trastuzumab
for metastatic breast cancer had been discontinued > 12 months prior to study entry, or if
they had AST/ALT levels 5 times the upper limit of
normal (although patients with AST/ALT levels > 115
U/L were not permitted to receive docetaxel).

Treatment
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either trastuzumab with weekly vinorelbine (Arm A) or trastuzumab with weekly taxane-based chemotherapy, either
paclitaxel or docetaxel (Arm B). In May 2003, the protocol was amended to permit patients who were randomized to Arm B to receive trastuzumab and
paclitaxel plus carboplatin. The choice of the taxane
and whether to give carboplatin was made by the
treating investigator. Only 8 patients were randomized
to Arm B after the amendment was approved, and
only 2 patients received paclitaxel and carboplatin.
Trastuzumab was administered weekly at 2 mg/kg
after a 1-time loading dose of 4 mg/kg. There were
no dose modifications. Trastuzumab was stopped
and patients were taken off study for grade 3 cardiotoxicity or LVEF < 40%.
Vinorelbine was administered weekly at 25 mg/m2
in cycles defined as 8 weeks with the dose adjusted
each week as follows: The dose was decreased to
15 mg/m2 for a neutrophil count from 750/mm3 to
1250/mm3, or a platelet count from 50,000/mm3 to
99,000/mm3, or grade 2 neurotoxicity; the dose was
decreased to 12.5 mg/m2 for a bilirubin level from

TRAVIOTA Study/Burstein et al.

2 mg/dL to 3 mg/dL; and the dose was delayed
for a neutrophil count < 750/mm3, or a platelet
count < 50,000/mm3, or a bilirubin level > 3 mg/dL,
or for other treatment-related, grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity.
Paclitaxel was administered weekly at 80 mg/m2
in cycles defined as 8 weeks with the dose adjusted
each week as follows: The dose was decreased to
40 mg/m2 for a bilirubin level from 2 mg/dL to 3 mg/
dL; the dose was delayed for a neutrophil
count < 1000/mm3, or a platelet count < 100,000/
mm3, or a bilirubin level > 3 mg/dL, or for treatment-related, grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. The
paclitaxel dose could be decreased to 70 mg/m2 for
grade 2 neurologic toxicity. Patients who were given
combination paclitaxel plus carboplatin received
paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin at an area
under the concentration time curve of 6 (according
to the Calvert formula) every 3 weeks with dose
delays according to the same criteria that were
applied for weekly paclitaxel.
Docetaxel was administered at 35 mg/m2 on
Weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 of each 8-week treatment cycle
with the dose adjusted each week as follows: The
dose was decreased to 17.5 mg/m2 for a bilirubin
level from 2 mg/dL to 3 mg/dL; the dose was
decreased to 30 mg/m2 for asymptomatic, grade 3
peripheral edema or grade 3 eye tearing or nail toxicity; and the dose was delayed for a neutrophil
count < 1000/mm3, or a platelet count < 100,000/
mm3, or a bilirubin level > 3 mg/dL, or for symptomatic, grade 3 peripheral edema or other treatmentrelated, grade 3, nonhematologic toxicity. The docetaxel dose could be decreased to 30 mg/m2 for grade
2 neurologic toxicity. Supportive care, including
antiemetics, growth factors, fluid administration, and
premedication for taxane-related hypersensitivity
and/or fluid retention syndrome, was given according to standard institutional practice.
Patients were restaged every 8 weeks for the first
24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients who
had progressive disease were taken off study along
with patients who had unacceptable toxicity. Patients
were allowed to switch from 1 taxane-based regimen
to another during the first 3 weeks of treatment;
thereafter, switching taxane regimens was considered
the end of protocol-based treatment (only 1 patient
switched after 1 week). The LVEF was determined at
baseline, after 16 weeks of treatment, and as indicated clinically thereafter; patients were taken off
study for symptomatic heart failure (National Cancer
Institute grade 3 or 4) or for an LVEF < 40%.
Two response criteria were used: the RECIST criteria and the RECIST criteria modified as follows:

967

Confirmation was not required that partial responses
and complete responses lasted for 4 weeks. The
time to progression (TTP) was defined as according
to the RECIST criteria, and the time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined as the time until TTP or until
patients were taken off study for treatment-associated toxicity.

Statistical and Analytical Methods
The primary endpoint was the response rate, and
secondary endpoints were the TTP, TTF, and toxicity
assessment. The original planned sample size was
250 patients, which would have had power (83%) to
distinguish response rates from 78% to 60% between
the 2 regimens. Two planned interim analyses were
presented to the data safety and monitoring board
after accrual of 20 patients and 53 patients to determine whether differences in toxicity or efficacy warranted stopping accrual; such differences were not
identified, although poor rates of accrual were noted.
The study was closed early because of poor accrual,
having accrued a total of 81 patients. With 41
patients and 40 patients on each arm, the study at
conclusion had 80% power to detect differences in
the response rate of 40% versus 73% between the 2
arms, and differences in the TTP hazard ratio of 0.42
(eg, a true median TTP of 6.0 months and 14.3
months in the 2 arms). Two-sided statistical tests
were used for all comparisons.

RESULTS
Patient Accrual and Characteristics
The current study opened to accrual in August 2001,
and 34 centers participated in the trial. Accrual consistently was short of expectations, despite efforts to
increase accrual through protocol amendments
(adding the option of the paclitaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab regimen, liberalizing eligibility requirements) and concerted educational efforts. After
discussion with the lead investigators and the data
safety and monitoring board, the study was closed
on December 31, 2003 because of slow accrual. At
that time, a total of 85 patients had enrolled on
study. Four randomized patients did not have baseline or follow-up data, did not start treatment on
trial, and went off study within 2 days of being randomized. These 4 patients were excluded from the
subsequent analyses, leaving 81 patients who constitute the results in this report.
The clinical characteristics of the patients and
the biologic/pathologic features of their tumors are
shown in Table 1. Patients had a median age of 55
years in Arm A (range, 36–79 years; 32% aged

< 50 years) and 50 years in Arm B (range, 37–83
years). All tumors overexpressed HER2, mostly as
determined by IHC. Nearly 50% of patients had
received adjuvant chemotherapy. The clinical features were consistent with HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer: Roughly 40% of tumors had hormonereceptor expression, > 50% of patients had experienced recurrent disease within 2 years of diagnosis,
and the vast majority of patients had visceral-dominant tumor burden with multiple sites of tumor recurrence.
Randomization with this small sample size did
not afford uniform balance with respect to all baseline characteristics. Compared with the patients on

Arm B (trastuzumab and taxane), patients on Arm A
(trastuzumab and vinorelbine) were more likely to
have had metastatic disease > 2 years after their initial diagnosis and to have hormone-receptor positive
tumors, a performance status of 0, liver metastases,
and prior adjuvant chemotherapy. Rates of prior adjuvant anthracycline-based and/or taxane-based
chemotherapy were comparable in the cohorts.

Treatment Dosing and Toxicity

paclitaxel and carboplatin (n 5 2 patients), at the
choice of the treating investigator. Patients in the
trastuzumab-vinorelbine arm received a median of 4
8-week cycles of treatment; patients in the taxane
arm received a median of 3 such cycles (mean number of cycles: vinorelbine, 3.8 cycles; paclitaxel, 3.1
cycles; docetaxel, 3 cycles). Table 2 indicates the percentage of planned doses received for trastuzumab
and chemotherapy in the treatment groups. Delivered doses of trastuzumab were comparable across
the regimens; vinorelbine dose delivery was lower
than taxane dose delivery. Patients in Arm A (vinorelbine) were more likely to have chemotherapy treatment delays (82% had at least 1 week of delay)
compared with patients who received taxane therapy
(60% overall, 56% for paclitaxel, and 63% for docetaxel). The most common cause for delay was neutropenia;
cardiotoxicity,
fluid
retention,
and
pancreatitis also led to treatment delays.
The LVEF was measured at baseline, after 2
cycles of chemotherapy, and otherwise when clinically indicated. Ejection fraction was well preserved
among most patients on study (see Fig. 1). Two
patients came off study for cardiac toxicity, both in
the vinorelbine arm. One patient had a decrease in
ejection fraction and symptomatic congestive heart failure (grade 3). Another patient had a myocardial infarction (grade 4) of unclear relation to study treatment.

associated with greater incidence of anemia and neutropenia, although there were no episodes of grade 3
or 4 febrile neutropenia observed during the trial.
Taxane-based therapy was more likely to be associated with dermatologic problems, including alopecia, rash, and nail changes. Docetaxel therapy was
associated specifically with fluid retention syndrome
in 2 patients and excessive tearing/lacrimation in

peripheral neuropathy was comparable across all
treatment regimens, although grade 3 neuropathy
occurred in 4 patients who received paclitaxel but in
only 1 patient on vinorelbine and 1 patient on docetaxel. Gastrointestinal side effects, such as constipation, mucositis, nausea, and vomiting, were common
in all treatment groups and generally were mild in
nature. In the aggregate, the toxicity experience
encountered in this randomized trial tended to mirror previous experience in Phase II/III trials with
these agents and schedules with respect to both the
type, incidence, and severity of side effects.

Treatment Efficacy
The primary study endpoint was the response rate,
as determined by strict RECIST criteria. Response
was considered unevaluable if a patient had baseline
lesions that were not followed (if a complete/partial
response was not confirmed in serial imaging studies
or if it was not documented that stable disease persisted for 6 weeks). Lesions that were measured
over time using different methods were excluded
from calculations. In total, 21 patients (51%; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 35–67%) in the trastuzumab plus vinorelbine arm responded to treatment,
and 16 patients (40%; 95% CI, 25–57%) in the trastuzumab plus taxane arm responded to treatment (Table 4). The difference was not statistically significant
(P 5 .37; Fisher test). In a second response analysis
(see Table 4), RECIST criteria were applied as in the
primary response analysis, but unconfirmed response
and stable disease (regardless of duration) were
included. In the trastuzumab plus vinorelbine arm,
27 patients (66%; 95% CI, 49–80%) responded to
treatment; in the trastuzumab plus taxane arm, 23
patients (58%; 95% CI, 41–73%) responded using
these criteria.
The response rate was also characterized among
patients with prior adjuvant taxane exposure, including 7 such patients in the trastuzumab/vinorelbine
arm (with 2 responses; 29%) and 9 patients in the
trastuzumab/taxane arm (with 3 responses; 33%).
The TTP and the TTF analyses are shown in Figure 2.
Patients who received trastuzumab plus vinorelbine
had a longer progression-free and/or recurrence-free
survival than patients who received trastuzumab plus
taxane (median TTP, 8.5 months vs 6.0 months; logrank P 5 .09). Similarly, patients who received trastuzumab/vinorelbine had a longer TTF than patients
who received trastuzumab/taxane (median TTF, 5.8
months vs 4.7 months; log-rank P 5 .15). Of
the patients who received trastuzumab/vinorelbine,
17 patients came off study for progressive disease, 7
patients came off study for toxicity-related reasons,

* In 6 patients, there was a lack of confirmation or follow-up; in 4 patients, not all baseline lesions
were followed; in 4 patients, there was a lack of measurement data after baseline; in 3 patients, there
was a lack of confirmation/follow-up, and baseline lesions were not followed; 1 patient had nonmeasurable tumors only; 1 patient was missing greatest dimension measurement, and the baseline
lesions were not followed; and 1 patient had a change in method of measurement, and the baseline
lesions not followed.

3 patients came off study because they achieved an
optimal response, and 8 patients came off study
because they withdrew consent or their physician
decided on withdrawal without known disease progression or specific toxicity; in the trastuzumab/taxane arm, 21 patients, 10 patients, 2 patients, and 4
patients, respectively, came off study for the same
reasons. Six patients were on trial at the time of
study closure. Two patients in each arm developed
new central nervous system metastases as their site
of progression. There were only 5 deaths reported either on study or in the available follow-up period,
including 3 deaths on the trastuzumab/vinorelbine
arm and 2 deaths on the trastuzumab/taxane arm.

DISCUSSION
Trastuzumab paired with chemotherapy improves
survival in women as first-line treatment for HER2overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer. Clinical
investigation informed by empiric drug selection and
preclinical laboratory data has generated several
widely used combination regimens. The TRAVIOTA
study was developed to compare prospectively the
efficacy and tolerability of 2 of the most commonly
employed regimens—trastuzumab with weekly vinorelbine or taxane chemotherapy. The major findings
of this study underscore the fundamental similarities

treatment failure (bottom) for patients who were randomized to receive therapy with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine (solid line) or trastuzumab plus taxane
(dashed line).

of these regimens. Each proved reasonably well tolerated with side-effect profiles consistent with prior experience with these chemotherapy regimens and
schedules. Response and TTP outcomes also were
similar for each strategy, with small numerical
advantages favoring the vinorelbine-based arm. We
believe that these results suggest that either trastuzumab/vinorelbine or trastuzumab/taxane is a reasonable first-line regimen for HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer.
A major limitation of our trial was the lack of
accrual and the resulting smaller than anticipated
study size and loss of analytical power. It is not clear
what contributed to the lack of accrual, although
attempts to boost accrual by offering a third taxanebased treatment option and through liberalizing eligibility criteria were unsuccessful. Nonetheless, we
believe the data are informative for several reasons.
First, the relative lack of data from randomized trials
in the metastatic setting underscores the need for
any comparative data. Second, the clinical observations in the trial fit well with previous reports from

Phase II/III trials, suggesting that the data provide a
fair point of reference. Finally, evolving experience
using single-agent taxane or vinorelbine plus trastuzumab as adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for
early-stage breast cancer suggests, indirectly, the
comparability of these regimens for treating HER2overexpressing breast cancer.19–21
Our trial does not address the issue of whether
polychemotherapy—particularly, employing platinum-based agents—with trastuzumab is superior to
single-agent chemotherapy with trastuzumab. There
are conflicting data from randomized trials on this
point. Both vinorelbine and taxane chemotherapy
have demonstrated synergy with trastuzumab in preclinical studies of growth inhibition of HER2-positive
breast cancer cell lines. Based on the data from the
TRAVIOTA study, clinicians and patients may select
single-agent chemotherapy/trastuzumab regimens
based on likely efficacy and side-effect outcomes.
The data from this trial support the ongoing development of vinca- and taxane-based chemotherapy
treatments paired with anti-HER2 therapy in the
management of early- and late-stage, HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.
