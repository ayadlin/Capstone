ABSTRACT
Epigenetic alterations, including dysregulated DNA methylation and histone
modifications, govern the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Cancer cells exploit
epigenetic regulation to control cellular pathways, including apoptotic and metastatic
signals. Since aberrations in epigenome can be pharmacologically reversed by DNA
methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, epigenetics in combination
with standard agents are currently envisaged as a new therapeutic frontier in cancer,
expected to overcome drug resistance associated with current treatments. In this
study, we challenged this idea and demonstrated that the combination of azacitidine
and romidepsin with IFN-a owns a high therapeutic potential, targeting the most
aggressive cellular components of CRC, such as metastatic cells and cancer stem
cells (CSCs), via tight control of key survival and death pathways. Moreover, the
antitumor efficacy of this novel pharmacological approach is associated with induction
of signals of immunogenic cell death. Of note, a previously undisclosed key role of
IFN-a in inducing both antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on CSCs of CRC was
also found. Overall, these findings open a new frontier on the suitability of IFN-a in
association with epigenetics as a novel and promising therapeutic approach for CRC
management.

poorly differentiated metastatic cells, capable of migrating
and invading basal lamina, and cancer stem cells (CSCs), a
highly tumorigenic population with elevated self-renewing
capability [5, 6]. Of interest, these cell populations share
molecular characteristics, drive metastasis formation
and confer resistance to conventional drug therapies [7].
Recently, epigenetic alterations have been discovered as
key factors in CRC pathogenesis [8-11]. Accumulating
evidence indicates that abnormal changes in DNA
methylation and histone modifications may act in concert
in regulating expression of genes that drive the tumorigenic

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) develops upon a multistep
process in which genetic mutations and epigenetic
alterations drive tumor initiation, progression and
metastatic growth [1-3]. Typically, KRAS mutations are
key elements in determining CRC aggressiveness and
resistance to therapy, since they activate cell proliferation,
differentiation, survival, migration and apoptosis [4].
Another key factor contributing to CRC aggressiveness
is the elevated degree of cell heterogeneity due to both

process [12]. Since both histone modifications and DNA
methylation are potentially reversible by pharmacological
treatments, they represent attractive targets for therapeutic
strategies. On this basis, the DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor (DNMTi) azacitidine and the histone deacetylase
inhibitor (HDACi) romidepsin have been approved by
FDA for treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome
and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, respectively [13], and
are currently under evaluation for solid tumors, such as
glioblastoma, renal and lung cancer [14, 15]. Because of
the limited results as monotherapies, a more rational use
of epigenetic drugs foresees the combination with other
therapies, also in the perspective of lowering doses to
override high dose-associated cytotoxic and off-target
effects [16-18]. Given the potential of epigenetic drugs
to stimulate the immune system, their combination with
immunomodulators may be regarded as a promising
new frontier [19-21]. In this context, IFN-α2b (IFN-α)
represents one of the most suitable candidate for such
association, due to its potent direct and immune-mediated
antitumor activities [22]. Noteworthy, a tight crosstalk
between IFN-α and epigenetic signatures as well as the
dysfunctional induction of IFN-α response in CSCs have
been recently reported to associate with tumor progression
[23-25].
Immunogenic cell death (ICD), a type of apoptosis
characterized by high potential of stimulating immune
cells, has emerged as one of the most powerful cellular
processes capable to strengthen the anti-tumor specific
immune response [26]. Only some chemotherapeutics or
radiation are endowed with the ability to trigger ICD [27].
Recently, type I IFN (IFN-I) signaling has emerged as
mandatory to achieve ICD-mediated antitumor response
to anthracycline [28]. Hence, IFN-α owns the potential to
cooperate with other therapeutic strategies, by supporting
killing of cancer cells while generating immunogenic
signals [29].
Herein, we investigated the capability of IFN-α to
cooperate with azacitidine and romidepsin in hampering
the aggressiveness of both metastatic cells and CSCs in
CRC. We found that IFN-α potentiates the antiproliferative
and pro-apoptotic properties of azacitidine and romidepsin
in vitro and it is essential for triggering cell death with
immunogenic features, ultimately improving dendritic cell
(DC) phagocytosis of drug-treated cancer cells. Lastly,
IFN-α cooperates with both drugs to inhibit tumor cell
growth in vivo.

potential of KRAS-mutated CRC cells, we first identified
the effective combination dose with the minimum potential
toxicity. To this end, we measured cell viability by MTS
assays and defined the lowest dose of each agent, ranging
between IC20 and IC10, effective on both KRAS-mutated
metastatic SW620 cells and CTSC#18, a CSC line derived
from a CRC patient [30] (Table 1). SW620 and CTSC#18
cells resulted differently sensitive to azacitidine and
romidepsin, being the former early responders at higher
drug doses and the latter susceptible to lower drug doses
at later time points (Supplementary Figure 1). Comparable
and even lower ranges of drug-sensitivity were found for
the KRAS-mutated poorly invasive SW480 cells and for
three KRAS-wild-type CSC lines (CTSC#1.2, CTSC#85,
CTSC#CRO) (Supplementary Table 1). Together, these
results indicate that KRAS mutation confers a relative
resistance to all tested agents as single treatments.
Therefore, we tested the effects of combined azacitidine,
romidepsin and IFN-α (hereafter: ARI) in SW620 and
CTSC#18 cells, owing simultaneously high metastatic
potential and elevated resistance to the antiproliferative
effects of the single agents. We found that while azacitidine
and romidepsin combined treatment (AR), with respect to
the single agents, slightly inhibited SW620 and CTSC#18
proliferation, the addition of IFN-α to the epigenetic
agents drastically enhanced these antitumor effects
(Figure 1A). Of note, the KRAS-wild-type CTSC#85 and
CTSC#CRO CSC lines exhibited even a higher sensitivity
to ARI or IFN-α in combination with romidepsin (RI)
(Figure 1A). These data were further confirmed in SW480
and CTSC#1.2 cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Next, we
investigated the mechanisms underlying the antitumor
cooperation between IFN-α and epigenetic drugs. We
found that, while azacitidine determined a significant
arrest of SW620 cells in G2/M and romidepsin promoted
accumulation of cells in the G1 phase, IFN-α was unable
either to influence cell cycle progression, as single agent,
or to interfere with the predominant activity of romidepsin
on azacitidine (Figure 1B). Nevertheless, IFN-α, alone or
in RI and ARI combinations, stimulated induction of the
cell cycle inhibitors p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 (Figure 1C).
Of interest, CTSC#18 cells did not show any cell cycle
arrest and exhibited broad up-modulation of only p21Waf1/
Cip1
upon any treatment (Figure 1B and 1C).

ARI combined treatment strongly inhibits
invasive signaling pathways in both metastatic
cells and CSCs of CRC

RESULTS

We investigated the effects of ARI treatment on
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT-ERK1/2
survival pathway, pivotal for maintaining CRC cell
proliferation and invasion [31]. As shown in Figure 2A,
ARI combination decreased the levels of p-AKT/AKT
and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 in both SW620 and CTSC#18
cells. We also found that this triple drug combination

significantly decreased the expression of CXCR4, another
signal known to govern the metastatic phenotype of CRC
cells, partially via AKT-ERK1/2 pathway [32, 33] (Figure
2B). Accordingly, ARI-treated SW620 cells, with respect
to untreated cells, exhibited a clear impaired ability to
migrate, even in presence of CXCL12 (Figure 2C). As
CD133+CXCR4+ cells have been associated with poor
2-year survival of CRC patients [34], we also evaluated
the modulation of CD133 and found its strong reduction
in both SW620 and CTSC#18 cells 24 and 72 h after
treatment, respectively (Figure 2D). Down-modulation
of CD133 and CXCR4 surface expression in both types
of CRC cells upon ARI treatment was also confirmed by
flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure 3). Moreover, ARI
was the only treatment able to counteract the propensity of
IFN-α and azacitidine to slightly increase the expression of
c-Myc, a pivotal epigenetic-regulated transcription factor
whose expression is directly correlated with the metastatic
phenotype of CRC cells [35] (Figure 2E).

in ARI-induced apoptosis of SW620 cells was further
confirmed by the inhibition, at least in part, of this process
with the specific inhibitor z-DEVD-FMK (Supplementary
Figure 4). Overall, our results suggest that IFN-α owns the
potential to cooperate with epigenetic drugs in inducing
apoptosis by modulation of key apoptotic molecules.

ARI treatment drives ICD, increases the rate of
DC phagocytosis of drug-treated CRC cells and
inhibits in vivo tumor growth
Because it has been reported that ICD is a crucial
component of some antineoplastic treatments and that
IFN-I are implicated in this process [29, 41], we next
evaluated the capability of IFN-α to cooperate with
epigenetic drugs in inducing this type of cellular demise.
Thus, we assessed the translocation of Calreticulin (CRT)
from the lumen of ER vesicles to the surface of tumor cells
and the release of HMGB1, key hallmarks of ICD [26,
41, 42]. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that ARI
combination, with respect to single and double treatments,
was able to stimulate CRT membrane translocation in both
SW620 and CTSC#18, 72 h after exposure to drugs (Figure
4A and Supplementary Figure 5). Of interest, IFN-α,
when in ARI or RI combinations, significantly increased
the capability of romidepsin to induce HMGB1 release in
SW620 cells (Figure 4B). On the other hand, in CTSC#18
cells, IFN-α was able to induce this signal already as
single agent and to potentiate it in AI and RI combinations,
whereas no additive effects were observed upon ARI
triple treatment (Figure 4B). Altogether, these results
suggest that, although ARI treatment induces stronger
immunogenic signals in metastatic cells than CSCs,
these latter display a remarkable susceptibility already to
IFN-α as mono-treatment. Next, we evaluated whether the
immunogenic signals induced by the combination of IFN-α
with epigenetic drugs could be converted into enhanced
DC phagocytosis of drug-treated CRC cells. We found
that human DCs differentiated from peripheral monocytes
in the presence of IFN-α (IFN-α-DCs), endowed with a
high capability in inducing antitumor CD8+ T cell response
[43], were able to phagocyte, at very high rates, both ARItreated SW620 and CTSC#18 (Figure 4C). Noteworthy,
CTSC#18 cells exposed to IFN-α as single agent were
already efficiently taken-up by IFN-α-DCs (Figure 4C).
The strong propensity of IFN-α-DCs to phagocytose
both ARI-treated metastatic cells and CSCs was further
confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)
analysis (Figure 4D). Finally, to better investigate the
antitumor effects of combined epigenetic drugs and IFN-α
we performed in vivo experiments into SW620- and
CTSC#18-transplanted NOD-SCID mice (Supplementary
Figure 6). We found that ARI combination was effective in
causing a significant delay in the growth of both types of
tumors, although RI exhibited equally antitumor activity

ARI treatment induces high rate of apoptosis
Since one of the major objectives of therapeutic
treatments is to overcome the resistance of cancer to cell
death [36, 37], we investigated whether IFN-α was capable
to potentiate any pro-apoptotic effect eventually exerted
by the epigenetic drugs. After 48 h exposure, IFN-α
was found to cooperate with both AR and romidepsin
alone in enhancing significantly the apoptotic rate of
SW620 cells (Figure 3A). Noteworthy, in CTSC#18
cells IFN-α exhibited a strong capability to stimulate
apoptosis already as mono-treatment and enhanced the
pro-apoptotic properties mainly of romidepsin in both
ARI an RI combinations, disclosing the propensity of
these cells, usually highly apoptotic-resistant, to undergo
apoptosis upon exposure to these drugs (Figure 3A).
Accordingly, we observed the modulation of anti- and
pro-apoptotic proteins following ARI treatment. In
particular, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was decreased in both
SW620 and CTSC#18 cells, while the pro-apoptotic Bax
remained relatively stable in SW620 and was increased
in CTSC#18 cells, resulting in both cases in a significant
enhancement of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (Figure 3B). We also
found a strong up-modulation of BIM, another member
of the BCL-2 family, whose loss has been reported to be
associated with resistance to HDACi therapy [38] (Figure
3C). Interestingly, in CTSC#18 cells BIM was increased
as well upon RI treatment. Moreover, Survivin, another
apoptotic inhibitor protein correlated to cell death evasion
occurring upon most of the current therapies in CRC [39,
40], was significantly decreased in SW620 cells upon
ARI treatment, while a light decrease of this marker was
observed in CTSC#18 cells (Figure 3D). Lastly, activation
of Caspase-3 was observed in both cell types, although
in SW620 the AR combination was sufficient to induce
this event (Figure 3E). The involvement of Caspase-3

mutated highly metastatic SW620 cells and patientderived self-renewing CTSC#18 CSCs, by two main
mechanisms: (i) shutting down metastatic cellular
pathways, including CXCR4, ERK1/2 and AKT signals;
(ii) inducing apoptosis with ICD features able to deliver
signals to DCs that, in turn, increase their capability to
phagocytose drug-treated cancer cells. Noteworthy, the
other most striking and innovative observation of this
study is the capability of IFN-α as mono-treatment to exert
remarkable antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on
CSCs.

DISCUSSION
This study provides the first evidence that IFN-α
cooperates with epigenetic drugs in inducing direct and
immune-mediated antitumor effects on both metastatic
cells and CSCs of CRC. In particular, we report that
IFN-α in combination with epigenetic drugs inhibits
the proliferation and the metastatic behavior of KRAS-

The vast majority of diagnosed CRC is represented
by non-hereditary "sporadic cancers", characterized
by a progressive accumulation of multiple genetic and
epigenetic alterations within tumor cells [44]. Among
them, KRAS mutations are key activators of cell
proliferation and metastasis driving CRC progression [45].
Epigenetic mechanisms are linked to isoform-specific
KRAS proteins, that drive different cancer programs by
modulation of diverse downstream signaling pathways
[46]. Of interest, epigenetic alterations may act in concert
to regulate expression of genes implicated in cell cycle,
apoptosis, invasion and metastasis of almost all types

of CRC [47, 48]. In particular, deregulation of enzymes
mediating epigenetic alterations has been associated with
progression as well as clinical outcome of CRC [49,
50]. Likewise, high expression of HDACs is associated
with reduced survival of CRC patients [51]. Because
epigenetic alterations are reversible by blocking the
activity of epigenetic enzymes, both DNMTi and HDACi,
such as azacitidine and romidepsin, have been exploited
in diverse hematological malignancies and are currently
being tested in patients with solid cancers, including CRC
[52]. However, data collected from initial trials suggest
that azacitidine, utilized at maximally tolerated doses,

associates with extensive toxicity and minimal efficacy,
whereas it is effective in inhibiting tumor-specific DNA
hypermethylation at lower doses [15]. Similarly, while
romidepsin as monotherapy exerts minimal anticancer
activity with important side-effects, its use at lower

doses has showed great potential in modulating gene
expression [53]. Recently, combination of DNMTi and
HDACi with immunotherapy has been regarded as an
innovative therapeutic frontline [20]. In the present study,
we challenged this idea and found that the antitumor

effects of azacitidine and romidepsin, at low doses,
are strongly potentiated by IFN-α. In particular, ARI
combination determines in both metastatic cells and CSCs
strong inhibition of CXCR4, AKT and ERK1/2 pathways,
all invasive signals associated with CRC progression,
advanced tumor stage, lymphatic recurrence and poor
prognosis [54, 55]. Moreover, ARI down-modulates both
CD133, a well-known CSC marker whose association with
CXCR4 defines a subset of highly metastatic CSCs [34],
and c-Myc, one of the most critical transcription factor
implicated in CRC transformation [35].
Of note, the modulation of these signals are
associated with cell cycle arrest and up-modulation of
p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 only in SW620 cells, whereas a
moderate up-modulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 is observed in
CTSC#18 cells. These findings suggest that the growth
inhibitory effect exerted by ARI on metastatic cells and
CSCs may occur through different signaling pathways, as
observed in other cancer cells upon exposure to azacitidine
or decitabine in combination with FAS-ligand [56].
In this study, we also report for the first time
the cooperation between IFN-α and epigenetic agents
in promoting cell death of highly invasive CRC cells,
by the simultaneous control of cellular pathways
conveying apoptosis resistance [39]. However, while
ARI is the most effective treatment in inducing high
rate of apoptosis in metastatic SW620 cells, both ARI
and RI combinations stimulate high levels of apoptotic
cell death in CTSC#18 CSCs. Importantly, in both
cell models apoptosis occurs with significant downmodulation of a number of typical anti-apoptotic
regulators, such as Bcl-2, Bim and Survivin, and
increased levels of the pro-apoptotic Bax, along with
activation of Caspase-3. In this regard, because the
activation of CXCR4, ERK1/2 and AKT signals has
been associated with apoptosis resistance through
Survivin up-modulation [57], ARI treatment appears
to be a particularly suitable pharmacological option
to break this survival axis. Moreover, the antitumor
potential of this drug combination is strengthened by
its ability to interrupt apoptosis resistance associated
to c-Myc expression [58]. Overall, ARI combination
appears as a therapeutic strategy capable of modulating
the most common cellular signals responsible for CRC
therapeutic resistance, likely by re-establishing a correct
dialogue between epigenetic modifications and cellular
transcriptional activity.
Recently, ICD has emerged as a peculiar form
of apoptosis able to stimulate an efficacious adaptive
immune response against cancer cell-associated antigens
[29], and IFN-α has been reported among the few agents
that own the property to induce it [27]. Here, we report
that IFN-α is crucial in sustaining epigenetic-driven
induction of ICD, in both metastatic cells and CSCs. In
particular, IFN-α exhibits the capability to strengthen
significantly the basal propensity of romidepsin and
azacitidine to induce HMGB1 release, in SW620 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CSCs respectively, and to promote late CRT membrane
exposure when it is in combination with both epigenetics.
Of interest, the belated CRT surface exposure may
represent an immunologic hallmark specifically induced
by low doses of combined drugs, as reported for sublethal
chemotherapeutic treatment [59]. Noteworthy, the need
of ARI combination for stimulating ICD signals confirms
recent findings pointing out the requirement of the
immune system for the therapeutic efficacy of epigenetic
agents [60].
The translation of ICD into a therapeutic advantage
relies on the capacity of DCs, recruited to sites of ongoing
cancer cell death, to take up apoptotic bodies and prime
an adaptive immune response [61]. In this regard, over
the past years IFN-α has emerged as a key inducer of
differentiation and activation of DCs and, accordingly,
IFN-α-DCs are endowed with a marked phagocytic activity
and a special aptitude in inducing CD8+ T-cell response
[43]. In this study, we report that the phagocytosis rate of
IFN-α-DCs significantly increases only in the presence of
ARI-treated metastatic cells or CSCs. Of note, IFN-α-DCs
are also able to take up with great efficacy CSCs exposed
to IFN-α alone, fully in agreement with the capacity of
this cytokine to stimulate high HMGB1 release by CSCs.
Overall, from CSCs point of view, our data provide for the
first time the evidence that these cells are highly sensitive
to the antitumor effects of exogenous IFN-α, alone or in
combination with epigenetic drugs, primarily romidepsin.
This cooperation is further confirmed by the significant
inhibition of tumor growth in vivo by ARI and, to a lesser
extent, RI treatment.
Hence, we envisage that the strength of ARI
combination relies on re-establishing a normal
“epigenetic landscape” by the simultaneous use of
azacitidine and romidepsin, which leads to unlock
specific genes allowing IFN-α-induced transcriptional
activity, with the final result to control most of the
cellular signals deregulated during CRC development
and progression. Importantly, these signals converge
with the induction of ICD, bridging direct and immunemediated antitumor effects. These findings are also
supported by two recent reports highlighting the key
role of IFN signaling in the antiproliferative response to
DNA demethylation in both ovarian and CRC cells [62,
63]. Noteworthy, although IFN-α and epigenetic drugs in
combination exert significant antitumor activity in both
metastatic cells and CSCs, the traits of this response
own some differences in quality and timing between
the two types of CRC cells, suggesting the potential
to activate selective signals in different components of
the tumor mass. While future work will be necessary to
clarify the bases of these events, our data clearly support
the complementarity between epigenetic- and immunetargeting agents in inducing concomitantly direct and
immune-mediated antitumor effects and open a new
frontier for the management of CRC as well as other
solid tumors.

measured as a marker of cell viability using the CellTiterGlo™ (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cell cultures
Low passage-number cell lines SW480 and SW620,
obtained from American Type Culture Collection, were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza, Verviers,
Belgium) supplemented with 10% FBS (EuroClone, West
York, United Kingdom) in the presence of penicillin and
streptomycin. Cells were seeded at 3.5×104/cm2 and the
day after treated with 10 μM azacitidine, 2 nM romidepsin
and 104 IU/ml IFN-α alone or in combination. CSC lines
of CRC were generated by Dr Lucia Ricci-Vitiani as
previously described [30] and cultured in a serum-free
medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/
ml FGF-2 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NY). CSC lines were
validated by Short Tandem Repeat DNA fingerprinting. For
all CSC lines, profiles were compared against publically
available databases to confirm authenticity (Biological Bank
and Cell Factory, National Institute for Cancer Research,
IST, Genova, Italy). Both types of cells were either collected
for quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR),
immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting at 24,
48, or 72 h upon epigenetic and IFN-α treatments.

RNA preparation and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells with
TRIsureTM (Bioline, London, UK), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, quantified using NanoDrop
ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA) and converted
to cDNA by random primers and ThermoScript
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
qRT-PCR analysis was performed using the Applied
Biosystems 7500HT Real-Time PCR System. BIM
expression was analyzed by using the primer sequences:
5’-TGGCAAAGCAACCTTCTGATG-3’
and
5’-GCAGGCTGCAATTGTCTACCT-3’. PCR reactions
were prepared by using SensiMix SYBR Kit (Bioline).
Amounts of mRNA transcripts were expressed as absolute
copy numbers normalized to the housekeeping gene
GAPDH (ΔCt method).

Immunoblotting
Protein expression was assessed by lysing cells
with a high salt lysis buffer containing 500 nM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 300 nM NaCl, 1% NP40, 5 mM EDTA,
and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics,
Basel, Switzerland). Equal amounts of total proteins
were boiled in sample buffer and separated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE). To detect specific protein expression,
the following antibodies (Abs) were used: c-Myc,
Survivin, Caspase-3, p27, Tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotech,
CA), CXCR4, HMGB1 (Abcam, Cambridge, United
Kingdom), AKT, p-AKT, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, CD133,
Bax, p21 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), Bcl2 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using HRPconjugated secondary Ab and the ECL system (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckingham, United Kingdom). HMGB1
expression was analyzed in cell supernatants. Briefly,
equal amounts of each sample normalized by cell number
were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis
was performed with a rabbit polyclonal Ab to HMGB1,
as described [18]. The optical density of the bands was
measured by using the National Institutes of Health Image
J software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).

Drug sources
Azacitidine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, MO, USA), romidepsin from Selleckchem
(Houston, TX, USA) and IFN-α (Intron A) from Merck
Sharp and Dohme (Kenilworth, NJ, USA).

Cell viability assay
CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to
determine cytotoxicity effects after treatment with drugs.
Absorbance at 450 nm was determined on Opsys MR
spectrophotometer (DYNEX Technologies, Denkendorf,
Germany), using Windows Revelation QuickLink
Software. SW480 and SW620 cell lines were plated at a
density of 4×103 and 4.5×103 cell/well, respectively, in 96well plates, and then treated with various concentrations
of azacitidine, romidepsin and IFN-α for 48 and 72 h. At
the end of treatments, 20 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium (MTS) reagent were added to each well. The
plates were then incubated for 2 h at 37°C in the dark. Each
experimental condition was performed in triplicate and
repeated at least twice. All values were normalized with
respect to the viability of untreated cells. For cytotoxicity
analysis, CSCs were enzymatically dissociated using
TrypLE™ Express Enzyme 1X (Gibco/ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) and plated at 3×104 cells/ml
density, in triplicate, in 96-well plates, treated with various
concentrations of azacitidine, romidepsin and IFN-α
alone or in combination for 48 and 72 h. ATP levels were

Cell migration assay
SW620 cell line was treated for 72 h with ARI
treatment. Cells were then harvested with trypsin, washed
with chilled Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) pH 7.4
and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 0.5%
bovine serum albumin (migration medium), with or
without AMD3100 (5 μM, Sigma-Aldrich), and seeded in

duplicate (1×105 cells/chamber) in the upper compartment
of Boyden chambers. The lower compartment was filled
with migration medium containing or not 200 ng/ml
human recombinant CXCL12 (R&D Systems, Inc).
The upper and lower compartments were separated
by 8 μm pore size polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore,
Whatman, Clifton, NJ) coated with 20 μg/ml Collagen
type IV (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 μg/ml fibronectin
(Sigma-Aldrich). After 2 h of migration, non-invaded
cells presented on the upper surface of the filters were
mechanically removed, whereas cells that had migrated
to the lower surface were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(EuroClone) and stained with toluidine blue (SigmaAldrich). The numbers of invaded cells were counted in
ten different fields (magnification 40X).

7AAD-positive dead cells) by Kaluza Software. Isotypematched IgG Abs were used as control.

DC generation
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
obtained from the heparinized blood of healthy donors by
Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Seromed, Biochrom
KG, Berlin). Monocytes were isolated from PBMC
by column magnetic immunoselection (MACS CD14
microbeads, Miltenyi Biotec). Positively selected CD14+
monocytes were plated at the concentration of 2×106 cells/
ml in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% LPS-free fetal
calf serum. Cultures were maintained for 3 days with 500
U/ml GM-CSF and 10000 IU/ml IFN-α. After 3 days of
culture, non-adherent and loosely adherent cells namely
IFN-α-DCs, were collected and used for experiments.

Cell cycle analysis
SW620 and CTSC#18 cells were treated
with azacitidine, romidepsin and IFN-α alone or
in combination at the same dilutions used in drug
cytotoxicity experiments for 48 h. After treatment,
cells were harvested, washed with chilled PBS and
permeabilized with cold 70% ethanol at 4°C, overnight.
Then, cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended
in PBS containing Propidium Iodide (PI) (40 μg/ml) and
RNase A (100 μg/ml). Flow cytometry was performed on
Beckton–Dickinson Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter
(FACS, Franklin Lakes, NY) and samples analyzed
employing the FlowJo Software.

Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells

Cell death analysis

Confocal microscopy

SW620 and CTSC#18 cells were treated with
azacitidine, romidepsin and IFN-α, as described in the
cell cycle assay. After treatment, cells were harvested and
incubated with Annexin V-FITC and PI for the detection
of cell death, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were analyzed using FACS Calibur (Becton
Dickinson). Data analysis was performed by WINMDI
or Kaluza Software (Beckman Coulter). To determine the
effects of the Caspase-3 inhibitor, cells were pretreated
with z-DEVD-fmk (20 μM) for 2 h, stained and analyzed
as above to detect cell death.

For CLSM analysis, SW620 and CTSC#18 cells
were stained with PKH26 Fluorescent Cell Linker (SigmaAldrich), seeded and treated 24 h later with combined
drugs for 48 h. Then, untreated and treated CRC cells
were co-cultured with IFN-α-DCs for 4 h. Cells were fixed
and images were observed through a 20X objective lens.
Images were taken on an inverted microscope equipped
with a confocal spectral imaging system (Olympus
Fluoview 1000). Excitation light was obtained by a Diode
Laser HeNe (561 nm) for PE. PE-Red emission was
recorded from 583 to 628 nm. Images were analyzed by
the C1-LCSI EZ-C1 Software.

SW620 and CTSC#18 cells were stained with
PKH26 Fluorescent Cell Linker (Sigma-Aldrich), seeded
and treated 24 h later with azacitidine, romidepsin and
IFN-α alone or in combination. After 48 h treatment the
floating cells were harvested, centrifuged and pellets were
incubated for 4 h with IFN-α-DCs at 1:2 ratio. After coculture, IFN-α-DCs were stained with anti-CD11c Ab
(Becton Dickinson), and phagocytosis was detected by
FACS analysis using FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson)
enumerating double-positive CD11c+/PKH26+ cells.

Membrane CXCR4, CD133 and CRT expression

Animal studies

Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect
CXCR4, CD133 and CRT exposure in SW620 and
CTSC#18 cells treated with drugs. Briefly, cells were
treated for 24 (CD133 in SW620 cells), 48 (CXCR4 in
SW620 cells) and 72 h (CD133 and CXCR4 in CTSC#18
cells, CRT in both), as previously described and
stained for 30 minutes at 37°C with mouse anti-CD133
(Miltenyi Biotec Inc, Germany), anti-CXCR4 and antiCRT (Abcam) Abs. Samples were acquired by Gallios
(Beckman Coulter) and analyzed in live cells (excluding
