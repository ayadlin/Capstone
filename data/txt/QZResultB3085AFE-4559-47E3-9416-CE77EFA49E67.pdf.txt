Abstract
Ethacrynic acid (EA), a glutathione S-transferase inhibitor
and diuretic agent, inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis
in cancer cells. To improve the activities, the structure of EA
has been modified, and it has been shown that EA esters
had an increased cell growth inhibitory ability compared
with nonesterified analogue. EA butyl-ester (EABE) was
synthesized, and its apoptosis induction ability was studied.
The efficacy of EABE was compared with that of EA, and the
mechanisms of action were studied in HL-60 leukemia cells.
EABE exhibited greater cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis
induction abilities than did EA. EABE-induced apoptosis in
HL-60 cells correlated with increased levels of reactive oxygen
species, the death receptor 5 (DR5), and caspase activation
and decreased levels of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Pretreatment with antioxidants, either N-acetylcysteine or
catalase, completely blocked EABE-induced apoptosis, H2O2
accumulation, and up-regulation of DR5 levels. RG19, a subclone of Raji cells stably transfected with a GSTP expression
vector, and K562 cells with high endogenous GSTP1-1 activity
were less sensitive to EABE-induced apoptosis. EABE was
more rapidly taken up than EA by HL-60 cells as determined by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements of intracellular concentrations. These results suggest
that (a) H2O2 production is a mediator of EABE and EAinduced apoptosis; (b) GSTP1-1 plays a negative role in EABE
and EA-induced apoptosis; and (c) the activity of EABE is
greater than EA due to its more rapid entry into cells. [Cancer

Materials and Methods

Introduction
Ethacrynic acid (EA), a diuretic drug, has been found to be a
glutathione S-transferase (GST) inhibitor (1–5). Among GSTs,
GSTP1-1 catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione with a
broad range of substrates, including chemotherapeutic agents, and
acts as a detoxification enzyme (6). GSTP1-1 is overexpressed in a
variety of cancer cells, and its levels are further increased in
chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells (7–9). GSTP1-1 also has been
found to play a regulatory role in the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway and to participate in cellular survival and
death signals via protein-protein interactions with c-jun-NH2kinase 1 (JNK1) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (6, 10, 11).

Therefore, GSTP1-1 inhibitors could have therapeutic potential in
cancer by reversing drug resistance, by sensitizing chemotherapeutic agents, and/or by inducing cancer cell death directly. EA
forms a conjugate with reduced glutathione (GSH) spontaneously
and/or due to GST activity; however, the conjugate of EA with GSH
exhibits a greater inhibitory effect on GST activity than EA (12–14).
EA has been shown to potentiate the cytotoxic effect of
chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, chlorambucil, melphalan, mitomycin C, and Adriamycin in vitro (15–17) and has been
put into a phase I clinical trial in combination with thiotepa for
advanced cancer treatment (18).
EA inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in tumor cells at
high concentrations by an unknown mechanism (19, 20). Several
studies have shown that the depletion of GSH by EA results in an
oxidant stress that causes cell death (21, 22). In addition, it has
been suggested that activation of the MAPK pathway may also
participate in the cell death process induced by EA (19). The
structure of EA has been modified, and we found that EA esters
retained GSTP1-1 inhibition ability and also had an increased
ability to inhibit leukemia cell growth (23). In this communication,
we report that EA butyl-ester (EABE) inhibits cell growth and
induces apoptosis more potently than EA. EABE induces apoptosis
via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)–dependent pathway following
the depletion of GSH, decreases of the mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP), and up-regulation of the death receptor 5 (DR5).
The greater activity of EABE than EA was found to be due, at least
in part, to faster uptake of EABE based on measurements of the
intracellular concentrations of EABE and EA.

Reagents. EA, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), ethidium bromide (EB), acridine
orange (AO), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), catalase, and hydrogen
peroxide were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Rhodamine-123
(Rh123) and 5,6-carboxy-2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA) were obtained from Molecular Probes. Antibodies to poly-(ADPribose)-polymerase (PARP) were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, to
caspase-3 and caspase-8 from BD Biosciences, to DR5 from Alexis
Biochemicals, to Bid and h-actin from Santa Cruz Biotechology, Inc., to
Bcl-2 from Roche Diagnostics Corp., and to GSTP1-1 from CalbiochemNovabiochem Corp.
The synthesis of EABE and EA glutathione conjugate. EABE, [2,
3-dichlorine-4-(2-methylene-1-oxo-butyl) phenoxy] butyl acetate, was synthesized. Briefly, EA (0.65g, 2.1 mmol) and para-toluenesulfonic acid (0.08 g,
0.47 mmol) were dissolved in toluene (10 mL) and n-butanol (0.6 mL, 6.6
mmol). The mixture was heated to 40jC for 5 h. After cooling to room
temperature, the mixture was diluted with ether (10 mL) and washed with
5% sodium bicarbonate solution (10 mL  2) and then with distilled water
(10 mL). The ether layer was collected and dried with MgSO4. After filtering,
the ether was evaporated in a rotary evaporator at about 60jC, and the
target product (colorless oil, 0.71 g, 2.0 mmol, 95.2%) was obtained. The

Apoptosis Induced by Ethacrynic Acid Butyl-Ester
chemical structure of EABE was confirmed by IR spectroscopy, proton
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy.
EA glutathione conjugate (EA-SG) was prepared by Michael addition of
the a,h-unsaturated ketone moiety of EA to the cysteinyl-thiol of
glutathione in a slightly basic water/ethanol mixture as reported (24).
Cell lines. Human leukemia HL-60 and K562 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640. The media were supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin, 1 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS). RV5 and RG19 cells were subclones of human lymphoma
Raji cells which were transfected with a pcDNA3.1 vector and pcDNA3.1/
GSTP1cDNA vector, respectively (25). RV5 and RG19 cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 modified to contain 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10 mmol/L HEPES,
1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 1.5 g/L sodium
bicarbonate, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated FBS.
Cell growth inhibition. Cells were seeded at 1.0  105 cells/mL and
incubated with various concentrations of EA or EABE for 3 days. The total
cell number in each group was determined with the aid of a
hemocytometer, and cell viability was estimated by trypan blue exclusion.
The drug concentration that inhibited half of the cell-growth (IG50) was
calculated.
Quantitation of apoptotic cells. Levels of apoptotic cells were
determined by morphologic observation and annexin V assay. For
morphologic observation, cells were stained with AO and EB and assessed
by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (26). Briefly, 1 AL of a
stock solution containing 100 Ag/mL each of AO and EB was added to
25 AL of cell suspension. EB-negative cells with nuclear shrinkage, blebbing,
and apoptotic bodies were counted as apoptotic. The percentage of
apoptotic cells was calculated after observing a total of 300 cells. Annexin V
assay was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the annexin
V–FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences). In general, 106 cells were
washed twice with PBS and then exposed to annexin V–FITC and
propidium iodide (PI) in binding buffer for 15 min in the dark at room
temperature. The analysis was done using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson)
emitting an excitation laser light at 488 nm. Fluorescence signals were
detected at 518 and 620 nm for FITC and PI detection, respectively. The log
of annexin V–FITC fluorescence is displayed on the x-axis, and the log of PI
fluorescence is displayed on the y-axis. Data were analyzed using
CELLQuest (Becton Dickinson) software. For each analysis, 10,000 events
were recorded (25).
Determination of H2O2 production. Intracellular H2O2 production was
monitored by flow cytometry using DCFH-DA (27). In the present study,
cells in logarithmic growth (1  105 cells/mL) were labeled with 5 Amol/L
DCFH-DA for 1 h and then treated with or without EABE and EA at 37jC
for the indicated periods of time. After washing with PBS, cells were
analyzed by FACScan with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and
525 nm, respectively. Cells stimulated with 100 Amol/L H2O2 for 1 h were
used as a positive control.
Measurement of MMP. MMP was assessed by the retention of Rh123, a
membrane-permeable fluorescent cationic dye. The uptake of Rh123 by
mitochondria is proportional to the MMP (28). Briefly, cells (1  106) were
incubated with 0.1 Ag/mL Rh123 in the dark for 20 min at room
temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were analyzed by FACScan
with excitation and emission wavelength of 495 and 535 nm, respectively.
Western blot analysis. Protein extracts (50 Ag) prepared with
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 100 Amol/L leupeptin, and 2 Ag/mL
aprotinin (pH, 8.0)] were separated on an 8% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were
stained with 0.2% Ponceau S red to assure equal protein loading and
transfer. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were
incubated with polyclonal antibodies to PARP, GSTP1-1, or DR5 and
monoclonal antibodies to caspase-3, caspase-8, Bcl-2, Bid, and h-actin
overnight at 4jC. Immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham
Biosciences; ref. 29).

Measurement of intracellular glutathione (GSH) content. The levels
of intracellular GSH were measured by a monochlorobimane (mBCl)
fluorometric method in which mBCl was used as a sensitive and specific
probe to analyze GSH in intact cells (30). Briefly, 3  106 cells were washed
once, resuspended in 1 mL PBS containing 100 Amol/L mBCl, and
maintained at 37jC in the dark for 30 min before analysis. The formation of
the fluorescent adduct (GS-mBCl) was monitored with a fluorescence
spectrometer (Hitachi 650-60, Japan) using excitation and emission
wavelengths of 395 and 482 nm, respectively. The GSH content was
calculated as nanomoles per 106 cells based on a GSH standard curve.
GSTP1-1 activity assay. GSTP1-1 activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 25jC using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and GSH
as substrates (27). The linear increase in absorption at 340 nm due to the
conjugation of GSH (1 mmol/L) with CDNB (1 mmol/L) in HL-60 cell
lysates with or without the presence of EABE (40 Amol/L) was
determined. An extinction coefficient of 9.6 (mmol/L)1 cm1 was used
to calculate GSTP1-1 activity and expressed as nanomoles of product per
minute per milligram of protein. The activity inhibition rate was
calculated as (Vc  Vt)/Vc  100%. Vc represents GSTP1-1 activity of
the control group; and Vt represents GSTP1-1 activity of the treated
group.
Quantitation of intracellular EABE and EA content by highperformance liquid chromatography. HL-60 cells (105 cells/mL, 100 mL)
were incubated with 300 Amol/L of EA and EABE at 37jC for the indicated
periods of time, and more than 95% of cells were viable as determined by
trypan-blue exclusion assay. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS,
resuspended in 300 AL of cold PBS, sonicated for 10 s on ice, and then
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4jC for 15 min. The protein levels of the
supernatant fluids were assessed by Bradford protein binding assay.
Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to the supernatant fluid fraction at
a final concentration of 20% (v/v) to precipitate the proteins in the cell lysates.
The mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4jC for 15 min, and the
supernatant fractions and the internal standard (diclofenac) were injected
into a chromatographic column. The detection limits of EA and EABE in
blank biological samples were 0.45 and 1.50 Ag/mL, respectively. The recovery
rate was f55%.
The chromatographic system consisted of a LC-10AT vp pump
(Shimadzu Corp.) with a LC-10AT vp variable-wavelength UV absorbance
detector set at 280 nm. Analysis was done on a Diamonsil C18 reversedphase column (200  4.6 mm internal diameter; 5 Amol/L; Dikma
Technologies), operated at 40jC. Diclofenac was used as an internal
standard for the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay.
EA, EABE, and diclofenac have retention times of 6.55, 20.80, and 8.67 min,
respectively. Elution was done with a mobile phase [methanol/phosphoric
acid (0.2%)/acetonitrile = 40:25:35, v/v/v] at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. The
sample (10 AL) was injected, and triplicate measurements were done for
each time point. Solutions containing 3.0 to 96.0 Ag/mL of EABE, 0.94 to 30.0
Ag/mL of EA, or 3.75 Ag/mL of diclofenac prepared in PBS were used as
standards. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting chromatographic
peak ratios of standard area/internal standard (IS) area versus concentration
of the standard using linear regression. The calibration curves of test drugs
were linear over the concentration ranges used, and correlation coefficients
(r 2) were >0.99.
Statistics. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the
Student’s t test (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Corporation). Differences were
considered significant at P values <0.05.

Results
EABE is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth and inducer
of cell death than EA in HL-60 cells. The cytotoxic and cell
growth inhibitory effects of EA and EABE in HL-60 cells were
investigated. After 3 days of treatment, the IG50s of EA and EABE
in HL-60 cells were 40.14 and 5.38 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 1A).
About 60 Amol/L of EA did not affect cell viability, whereas
12 Amol/L EABE decreased viable cells to 15% (Fig. 1A).

Figure 1. EABE is a more potent cell growth inhibitor and apoptosis inducer than EA in HL-60 cells. A, cell growth inhibition and viability. HL-60 cells were treated with
indicated concentrations of EABE (4) and EA (o) for 3 d. Total cell number was counted using a hemocytometer, and cell viability was determined by trypan
blue exclusion. B, apoptotic cells determined by AO and EB staining. HL-60 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of EA or EABE for indicated times.
Percentages of apoptotic cells were determined using fluorescence microscopy after staining with AO and EB. C, apoptotic cells determined by annexin V staining.
HL-60 cells were treated with 12 Amol/L EABE for the indicated times. Apoptotic cells were detected using FACS after staining with annexin V–FITC.

To determine whether cytotoxicity-induced by EABE and EA was
due to apoptosis, apoptotic cells were determined based on
morphologic observations after staining with AO and EB. EABE
induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells at a concentration of 6 Amol/L
in a time as short as 6 h. About 68% of HL-60 cells underwent
apoptosis after treatment with 12 Amol/L EABE for 24 h (Fig. 1B).
However, to reach a similar apoptotic effect, EA was required to
be at concentrations higher than 100 Amol/L. The apoptotic effect
of EABE was confirmed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) after staining with annexin V (Fig. 1C). These data suggest
that both EABE and EA induce cytotoxicity through apoptosis
induction.
Apoptosis induction by EABE and EA correlates with an
increase of cellular H2O2 and a decrease in MMP in HL-60
cells. ROS accumulation has been proposed to be involved in
EA-induced cell death (19, 31, 32). H2O2 levels were determined
in HL-60 cells after EABE or EA treatment using a peroxidesensitive fluorescent probe, DCFH-DA. Intracellular H2O2 levels
were significantly increased after EABE treatment for only 1 h

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

(Fig. 2A). The mean of the oxidized DCF peak, which reflects the
H2O2 level, shifted from a position 9.6 to 97.0 after treatment
with 12 Amol/L EABE for 6 h. As the concentration of EABE was
increased from 3 to 12 Amol/L, more H2O2 was detected (data
not shown). However, although EA treatment increased cellular
H2O2 levels, it only did so at (high) concentrations that induced
apoptosis (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that H2O2 production is
the cause of EABE- and EA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells.
The impairment of mitochondrial function has been considered
to be a key event in the ROS-mediated apoptotic pathway (27, 33).
The MMP in HL-60 cells after EABE or EA treatment were
measured using flow cytometry after staining with the cationic
dye Rh123. A significant decrease of MMP was observed in HL-60
cells after treatment with 12 Amol/L EABE for 6 h. EA treatment
also induced a significant decrease of MMP, but at a higher
concentration (120 Amol/L; Fig. 2B). MMP was not influenced by
EA at lower concentrations or during treatments for a short time,
which were not sufficient to induce H2O2 accumulation and
apoptosis (data not shown). These data suggest that EABA and EA

Apoptosis Induced by Ethacrynic Acid Butyl-Ester

may induce apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated pathway
due to H2O2 production.
EABE-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by the antioxidants of NAC and catalase and is caspase dependent. To
determine whether intracellular H2O2 production is the mediator
of EABE-induced apoptosis, two antioxidants, NAC and catalase,
were used. Pretreatment with either NAC or catalase effectively
prevented apoptosis induction by EABE in HL-60 cells (Fig. 3A).
Correlated with apoptosis inhibition, both the EABE-induced H2O2
accumulation and the decrease in MMP were blocked by NAC or
catalase (Fig. 3B). Neither NAC nor catalase alone regulated apoptosis, H2O2 production, or MMP in HL-60 cells at the concentrations and treatment times tested (data not shown).

Caspase activation plays a pivotal role in the mitochondriamediated apoptotic pathway (27, 34). EABE induced a decrease
in the level of the procaspase-3 precursor in a dose-dependent
manner in HL-60 cells (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, a dose-dependent
decrease of the procaspase-8 precursor with the production of
the 23-kDa cleavage fragment was observed after EABE treatment
(Fig. 3C). EABE treatment also decreased Bid (a substrate of
activated caspase-8) levels and increased DR5 levels (Fig. 3C).
PARP cleavage, caspase-8 activation, and DR5 up-regulation
were all blocked by pretreatment with NAC or catalase. These
data suggest that a death receptor–mediated pathway is involved
in EABE-induced apoptosis, which follows increased H2O2
production.

Figure 2. EABE and EA induce H2O2 accumulation and decrease MMP in HL-60 cells. A, H2O2 accumulation. HL-60 cells were labeled with 5 Amol/L DCFH-DA
fluorescent probe for 1 h and then treated with or without 12 Amol/L EABE or 120 Amol/L EA for the indicated times. The addition of 100 Amol/L H2O2 for 1 h was used as
a positive control for H2O2 levels. Oxidized DCF was analyzed using FACScan. Open peaks, untreated cells; shaded peaks, treated cells. The peak shift to the right
indicates an increase in H2O2 level. B, MMP. HL-60 cells were treated with 12 Amol/L EABE or 120 Amol/L EA for the indicated times. Disruption of MMP was
determined according to changes of fluorescence density upon rhodamine 123 loading as described in Materials and Methods. Open peaks, untreated cells; shaded
peaks, treated cells. The peak shift to the left indicates a loss of MMP.

EABE decreases intracellular GSH content. EA can react with
–SH residues of GSH and many proteins (35). The intracellular
levels of GSH were determined in HL-60 cells after treatment with
various concentrations of EABE. There was no significant
alteration of GSH content in HL-60 cells treated with 3 or
6 Amol/L EABE for 2 h (Fig. 4A). However, intracellular levels of
GSH were significantly decreased following treatment with 9, 12,
or 15 Amol/L EABE for 2 h (Fig. 4A). EABE decreased GSH levels
after only 5 min of treatment with 12 Amol/L EABE (Fig. 4A).
To further show whether GSH is involved in EABE-induced
apoptosis, BSO, a GSH-depleting agent, was used. BSO treatment
led to a 40% decrease in GSH content. BSO pretreatment with
subsequent EABE exposure resulted in an even greater decrease
of GSH levels than those of cells treated with each agent alone.
Pretreatment with NAC prevented the decrease of GSH levels
due to EABE treatment (Fig. 4B). NAC protected against EABEinduced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, whereas BSO augmented it

(Fig. 4C and D). Similarly, EA decreased intracellular GSH levels
at concentrations that induced apoptosis (data not shown).
These results suggested that the EA- or EABE-induced decrease
in intracellular GSH levels may be due to the formation of GSH
conjugates. To determine whether the conjugates were active,
the conjugate of EA with GSH (EA-SG) was synthesized. Unlike
EA, EA-SG did not induce apoptosis at the same concentrations
with which EA induced apoptosis (data not shown).
Cells with high levels of GSTP1-1 activity are less sensitive
to EABE-induced apoptosis. The inhibitory effect of EABE on
GSTP1-1 activity was investigated in cell lysates directly treated
with EABE. The activity of GSTP1-1 was inhibited by 34%
and 75% after incubation with 2.5 and 10 Amol/L EABE for
30 min, respectively, in a cell-free assay (data not shown).
However, GSTP1-1 activity was slightly increased in HL-60 cells
treated with EABE at concentrations of 6 to 12 Amol/L for
24 h (Fig. 5A).

Figure 3. EABE-induced apoptosis, H2O2 production, and a decrease in MMP are blocked by antioxidants NAC and catalase. A, apoptotic cells. Cells were pretreated
with NAC (10 mmol/L) and catalase (500 units/mL) for 4 h, followed by treatment with or without 12 Amol/L EABE for 12 and 24 h. The percentage of apoptotic cells was
determined with the aid of a fluorescence microscope after AO and EB staining. ***, P < 0.001, compared with EABE-treated cells. B, H2O2 production and MMP

500 units/mL catalase for 4 h and then treated with or without 12 Amol/L EABE for an additional 24 h. The level of each protein was determined using specific antibodies
as described in Materials and Methods. D, Western blot analysis of JNK1 and phospho–stress-activated protein kinase/JNK. HL-60 cells were treated with EABE
at indicated concentrations for 24 h. The levels of JNK1 and phospho-JNK were detected using specific antibodies.

**, P < 0.01; and ***, P < 0.001, compared with control cells. ##, P < 0.01 compared with EABE alone–treated-cells. C, apoptotic cells determined by AO and EB

of EABE. Percentages of apoptotic cells were determined by fluorescence observation after AO and EB staining. D, apoptotic cells determined by annexin V staining.
HL-60 cells were pretreated with 10 mmol/L NAC or 100 Amol/L BSO for 4 h, followed by treatment with 12 Amol/L EABE for an additional 12 and 24 h, respectively.
Apoptotic cells were detected using FACS after staining with annexin V–FITC.

To further determine the role of GSTP1-1 in apoptosis induction
by EABE, RG19 cells, a subclone of Raji cells transfected with a
GSTP1 expression vector which have high levels of GSTP1-1 protein
(Fig. 5C) and activity (Fig. 5D), were used to compare the apoptotic
effect of EABE with that of RV5, a subclone of Raji transfected with
an empty vector. EABE at a concentration of 9 Amol/L induced
apoptosis in 63% of RV5, but only induced apoptosis in 24% of
RG19 cells after 12 h of treatment (Fig. 5B). K562 cells have higher
levels of GSTP1-1 protein (Fig. 5C) and activity (Fig. 5D) than HL-60
cells and were less sensitive than HL-60 cells to EABE-induced
apoptosis. EABE at a concentration of 9 Amol/L induced PARP
cleavage in HL-60 cells, but not in K562 cells (Fig. 5C). These data
suggest that GSTP1-1 may protect against EABE action.
EABE is taken up faster than EA in HL-60 cells. The uptake
rates of EA and EABE were measured in HL-60 cells using HPLC.
A HPLC method using diclofenac as an IS was established to
measure EA and EABE uptake in HL-60 cells. EA and EABE
(300 Amol/L) were incubated with HL-60 cells for indicated times,
and their intracellular levels were determined (Table 1). EA
accumulated in HL-60 cells in a time-dependent manner, but its
uptake rate was slower than that of EABE (Table 1). Intracellular
EA was not detectable at a 30-min incubation, whereas 21.88

nmol/mg protein of EABE was detected at that time. Interestingly,
EA was also detected in HL-60 cells after incubation with EABE.
The amount of EA increased, and the amount of EABE decreased
after longer incubation times with EABE treatment. These data
suggest that EABE is not stable in cells and is hydrolyzed to EA.
However, the total amount of intracellular EABE (including EABE
and its potential metabolite, EA) was about 10-fold higher than
that of EA after 60 min when initial concentrations of each were
equal (Table 1).

Discussion
Although EA has been found to be a potent GSTP1-1 inhibitor
in vitro, it inhibits tumor cell growth only at high concentrations
(19, 20, 36). To improve its antitumor activity, a group of EA
derivatives was synthesized, and some of them have shown
increased antiproliferative activity as well as GSTP1-1 inhibition
ability (23). Esterification of a compound makes it more lipophilic
and increases its cellular uptake. EABE is more rapidly taken up
and is a more potent apoptosis inducer than EA in HL-60 cells
(Fig. 1A and B, Table 1). Thus, the greater apoptotic effect of EABE
is probably due to its higher intracellular concentrations (Table 1).

Because both EABE and EA increase intracellular H2O2, decrease
MMP, and deplete GSH (Figs. 2–4, and data not shown), EA and
EABE probably induce apoptosis by the same or similar
mechanisms.
EABE- and EA-induced apoptosis correlates with H2O2 production, a decrease of MMP, and caspase activation (Figs. 1–3).
Mitochondria have been shown to play a critical role in ROSmediated apoptosis (37–40). Because EABE-induced H2O2 production, a decrease of MMP, and the activation of caspase-3 can be
inhibited by antioxidants NAC and catalase, it seems that a cascade
of H2O2 production to decrease MMP to caspase activation occurs
during the apoptotic process. However, cleaved fragments of
caspase-8 and Bid and up-regulated levels of the DR5 protein
were detected in EABE-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 3C). These data
suggest that a death receptor–mediated pathway is also involved
in EABE-induced apoptosis. DR5 has been found to be induced
by DNA-damaging agents in a p53-dependent fashion (41), and
its transcription can be directly transactivated by p53 through

an intronic, sequence-specific, p53 binding site (42). The possible
role of p53 in EABE-induced expression of DR5 could be excluded because HL-60 cells lack a functional p53 (43). Recently,
it has been found that DR5 expression could be induced through
a CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)mediated pathway (44, 45), and that the CHOP-mediated DR5
up-regulation after curcumin treatment was inhibited by the
antioxidant NAC (45). EABE-induced up-regulation of DR5 was
also inhibited by antioxidants (NAC and catalase; Fig. 3C). These
data suggest that increased DR5 levels after EABE treatment
may be due to the up-regulation of CHOP following H2O2
production.
GSH has been thought to be a primary regulator of intracellular
redox (46, 47). It has been found that intracellular GSH was
depleted before the onset of apoptosis induced by various agents
(48), and that the depletion of intracellular GSH rendered cells
more sensitive to apoptotic agents (26). Consistent with these
observations, EABE and EA decreased the content of GSH in

Figure 5. Cells with high levels of GSTP1-1 are less sensitive to EABE-induced apoptosis. A, GSTP1-1 activity in EABE-treated HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were treated

BSO decreased basal levels of GSH (Fig. 4B) and augmented
apoptosis induction in HL-60 cells treated with EABE (Fig. 4C and
D). Conversely, NAC prevented the decrease of GSH content in HL60 cells treated with EABE (Fig. 4B) and protected against EABEinduced ROS accumulation and apoptosis (Figs. 3B, 4C and D).
These data suggest that the decrease of GSH might be due to the
conjugation of EABE or EA with GSH. Because the conjugate of EA
with GSH decreases apoptosis induction (data not shown), it seems

that GSH binds competitively to EABE/EA and prevents them from
binding to proteins containing thiol groups that probably are
EABE/EA targets for apoptosis induction.
EA and its GSH conjugate are known GSTP1-1 inhibitors (13, 14).
Similar to EA, EABE also inhibits GSTP1-1 activity in a cell-free
assay. However, cells with higher GSTP1-1 activity and with
overexpressed GSTP1-1 protein were less sensitive to EABEinduced apoptosis (Fig. 5B and C). This suggests that GSTP1-1
may protect against EABE-induced apoptosis by catalyzing the
conjugation of EABE with GSH and which then inactivates it.
GSTP1-1 has been found to be an inhibitor of JNK activation, and
the levels of phosphorylated JNK is increased in EABE-treated
cells (Fig. 3D). This suggests that GSTP1-1 activity in cells may be
reversibly inhibited in EABE-treated cells. However, it seems that
EABE and EA induce apoptosis through a GSTP1-1 inhibition–
independent pathway because cells without GSTP1-1 are more
responsive to EABE/EA treatment, and EA-SG with increased
GSTP1-1 inhibition ability has less apoptosis induction ability (data
not shown).
In summary, the presented data show that EABE and EA induce
apoptosis through a ROS-mediated pathway, which is independent
of GSTP1-1 inhibition, but that both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways participate in EABE-induced apoptosis.
