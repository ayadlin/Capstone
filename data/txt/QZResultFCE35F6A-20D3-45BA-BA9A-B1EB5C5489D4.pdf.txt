BACKGROUND: The incidence of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) and the time to subsequent menstrual
bleeding in premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with current standard chemotherapy regimens was examined. METHODS: Four hundred sixty-six women ages 20 to 45 years at the time of diagnosis of a stage I to III breast
cancer were recruited between January 1998 and July 2002. Patients completed monthly bleeding calendars from
the time of study recruitment. Updated medical history data were obtained at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: Most
women received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC); doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (ACT); or
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). Approximately 41% of women experienced an initial 6
months of CIA, and an additional 29% had at least 1 year of CIA. Approximately half of the women with 6 months of
CIA and 29% of those with 1 year of CIA resumed bleeding within the subsequent 3 years, usually in the year after
their amenorrheic episode. Resumption of bleeding differed significantly by treatment regimen after 6 months of CIA
(P ¼ .002; 68% with AC, 57% with ACT, and 23% with CMF), but not after 1 year of CIA (P ¼ .5). Of the 23% of women
who experienced an initial 2-year period of CIA, 10% resumed bleeding within the ensuing 3 years after their amenorrheic episode, but none had regular menses. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of women treated with
chemotherapy will experience periods of CIA, but many will resume bleeding. Newer treatment regimens such as
ACT appear to have a higher resumption of bleeding compared with CMF. This finding may have implications for

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is second only to lung cancer in cancer mortality.1 Breast cancer treatment has evolved from radical surgery alone to a multimodality approach that combines surgery with radiotherapy
and chemotherapy. Several large randomized trials have shown conclusively that chemotherapy improves survival, especially in premenopausal women.2 One mechanism of action for this improvement in survival is likely ovarian suppression/
failure. However, improvements in survival rates can come at a cost, because cytotoxic drugs can lead to chemotherapyinduced amenorrhea (CIA) among younger patients.3,4 CIA is the term used to describe the occurrence of amenorrhea after chemotherapy. The length of the amenorrheic episode varies between studies.3 Premature ovarian failure suggests the
ovaries are no longer functional and have undergone an irreversible process by which estrogen is no longer being produced.
CIA is often associated with premature ovarian failure, with symptoms such as hot flushes, mood changes, atrophic vaginitis, and dyspareunia reported to occur.5,6 Other significant long-term effects include osteoporosis, an increased risk of

fractures, and cardiovascular disease.7-10 Resultant infertility from premature ovarian failure is an important issue
as more women delay pregnancy until later in life.
The definition of CIA has varied across studies,
resulting in a wide range in reported incidence from 27%
to 94% in patients treated with older cyclophosphamidebased or doxorubicin-based regimens.11 To the best of
our knowledge, there are very few data reported to date
regarding the effects of newer taxane-containing regimens
on menstrual cycles. Data concerning the rates of CIA are
also largely retrospective and consider CIA a secondary
endpoint. In 1994, Collichio and Pandya concluded that
only 15 of 40 studies reported the effects of cytotoxic
chemotherapy on ovarian function in premenopausal
women, a trend that has continued in subsequent published reports.12 It is important to determine the true
prevalence of CIA in a prospective manner given that the
current body of evidence comes from retrospective data.
Longer follow-up of these patients is also important
because resumption of menses may occur with longer follow-up. Such information would be relevant if there are
any thoughts of switching premenopausal patients from
therapy with tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors.
In this study, we prospectively examine the incidence of CIA, as well as the resumption of bleeding after
6, 12, and 24 months of amenorrhea after chemotherapy
among premenopausal patients with extended follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants were recruited to the Menstrual Cycle Maintenance and Quality of Life after Breast Cancer Treatment
Study, a multicenter, prospective observational study
designed, in part, to examine the effects of current, commonly used chemotherapy regimens on menstrual cycling
in premenopausal women.13 Eligibility criteria included
women between the ages of 18 and 45 years who were
diagnosed with stage I to III invasive breast cancer within
the previous 8 months. All were required to have regular
menstrual cycles at the time of diagnosis.
A total of 627 women were recruited from January
1998 through July 2002 at the following institutions: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,
New York; The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas; Presbyterian Hospital in
Dallas, Texas; and the Wake Forest University Baptist
Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
each hospital as well as the US Department of Defense
Human Subjects Committee.

Data Collection and Instruments
Medical chart review

Pathology and surgical reports were used to obtain
pathologic and surgical data. Medical oncology records
and radiotherapy summaries were used to obtain detailed
chemotherapy and radiotherapy data. All hormonal drug
treatments, such as tamoxifen, were recorded with the beginning dates, routes of administration, and dosages.
Monthly bleeding calendars

From the date of recruitment, participants completed bleeding diaries in the format of a monthly calendar. Participants marked the days they bled each month,
and whether the bleeding was mild, moderate, or heavy.
No data regarding hormone levels, such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or estradiol levels, were collected.
Follow-up questionnaires

At baseline and every 6 months thereafter, the participants completed mailed questionnaires regarding their
quality of life, general medical status, cancer recurrence
status, reproductive events, and any surgical procedures or
conditions that could change the bleeding status such as
hysterectomy or oopherectomy. Furthermore, information concerning any drugs such as tamoxifen or hormonal
treatments and those used in assisted reproduction techniques were obtained and recorded. All follow-up data collection was completed centrally by staff at the study
Coordinating Center at the Wake Forest University
School of Medicine.
Statistical Analysis
Bleeding calendars were examined after the end of chemotherapy to determine if any menstrual bleeding had
occurred. We studied the first 6, 12, and 24 months after
chemotherapy, and those women without any bleeding in
those time periods were considered to have 6, 12, and 24
months of CIA, respectively. Logistic regression was used
to determine which characteristics were jointly predictive
of amenorrhea. Variables included in the analyses were
clinic site, age (20-34 years, 35-39 years, and 40 years),
body mass index (BMI) (underweight/normal, overweight, obese), race/ethnicity (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian), smoking status (never, former,
current), strenuous exercise (none, 1-2 days/week, 3
days/week), age at first menstrual period (11 years, 12
years, 13 years, 14 years), full-term births (0 vs 1),

12-month, or 24-month) amenorrheic episode. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine which
characteristics were jointly predictive of subsequent
bleeding.
To assess the impact of missing bleeding calendars
on study results, analyses were repeated using 1) data from
patients who completed any calendars, 2) data from
patients who completed more than half their bleeding calendars, 3) patients who had complete bleeding records,
and 4) an imputation and weighting scheme. Estimates
and significant predictors were consistent across the different analyses, so we report here the results based on the
women who returned more than half their diaries for each
specified amenorrheic episode (eg, at least 4 months of
diaries when estimating the initial 6 months of CIA).

RESULTS
Between January 1998 and July 2002, 627 women were
enrolled in this study and 550 (88%) received chemotherapy. Of these women, 466 returned more than half of
their bleeding calendars in the 6-month, 12-month, or
24-month period after chemotherapy and could be used
in the determination of 6, 12, or 24 months of CIA. Characteristics for these participants are shown in Table 1. All
patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy; the majority
were treated with either AC, ACT, or CMF. Details
regarding treatment, including chemotherapy regimens,
have been published previously.13 Table 2 shows the
patient characteristics for those women who were and
were not included in the analyses. Significant (P <.05)
differences are denoted by an asterisk. Those women who
were excluded from the analyses were more likely to have
larger tumors, more positive lymph nodes, and higher histologic grades.
Of the 466 women who received chemotherapy and
returned the majority of bleeding calendars, 439, 445,
and 403, respectively, returned at least half of their calendars during the first 6, 12, and 24 months after the end of
chemotherapy. In the first 6 months after the end of
chemotherapy, 178 of 439 women (41%) were amenorrheic. Of these, 48% resumed bleeding in the subsequent
3 years (3.5 years after chemotherapy) (Fig. 1). Of 445
patients, 128 (29%) did not bleed during the first year after the completion of chemotherapy. Of these, 29%
resumed bleeding within the subsequent 3 years (4 years
after chemotherapy). At 2 years after chemotherapy, 91 of
403 patients (23%) remained amenorrheic. Of these, only
10% resumed bleeding within the subsequent 3 years (5

years after chemotherapy) (Table 3). In comparison, of
the women who had some bleeding during the first 6, 12,
and 24 months after treatment, 95%, 92%, and 83%,
respectively, experienced some bleeding in the subsequent
3 years.
Logistic regression was used to determine which demographic and clinical factors were jointly associated with
the initial 6-month, 12-month, or 24-month periods of
CIA. Older age (P <.001), BMI (P ¼ .042), treatment
regimen (P ¼ .011), tamoxifen use (P <.001), and longer
duration of chemotherapy (P ¼ .035) were found to be
significantly associated with 6 months of CIA after adjusting for all other characteristics. Compared with women
aged 40 years, the odds of an initial 6-month amenorrheic period were 0.04 (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 0.02-0.09) for women ages 20 to 34 years and 0.17
(95% CI, 0.10-0.30) for women ages 35 to 39 years.
Compared with women of normal BMI, the odds of an
initial 6-month amenorrheic period were 2.17 (95% CI,
1.19-3.97) for overweight women and 1.17 (95% CI,
0.57-2.41) for obese women. Women receiving CMF
were least likely to experience a 6-month amenorrheic period. The odds ratios (ORs) for CMF versus the other regimens were as follows: AC, 0.37 (95% CI, 0.15-0.95);
ACR, 0.14 (95% CI, 0.03-0.57); ACT, 0.30 (95% CI,
0.15-0.63); and others, 0.36 (95% CI, 0.15-0.86). The
differences among the other regimens were nonsignificant. The odds of experiencing an initial 6-month period
of CIA were 2.72 (95% CI, 1.64-4.50) times greater for
women receiving tamoxifen compared with those not
receiving tamoxifen, and the odds of a 6-month amenorrheic period increased by 4% for every additional week of
chemotherapy (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.09).
Twelve-month amenorrheic episodes were found to
be significantly associated with older age (P <.001), treatment regimen (P ¼ .026), tamoxifen use (P <.001), and
longer duration of chemotherapy (P ¼ .004) after adjusting for other characteristics. Compared with women aged
40 years, the odds of an initial 12-month amenorrheic
period were 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.11) for women ages 20
to 34 years and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.11-0.36) for women ages
35 to 39 years. Women receiving ACR were most likely to
experience 12 months of CIA. The ORs for ACR versus
the other regimens were as follows: AC, 9.41 (95% CI,
1.98-44.7); ACT, 7.17 (95% CI, 1.75-29.5); CMF, 10.9
(95% CI, 2.44-48.8); and others, 4.67 (95% CI, 1.1219.6). The differences among the other regimens were
nonsignificant. The odds of experiencing an initial 6month period of CIA were 2.96 (95% CI, 1.68-5.24)

Amenorrhea and Recovery After Chemotherapy/Sukumvanich et al

Figure 1. Long-term resumption of menstrual cycles after cytotoxic chemotherapy is shown by amenorrheic status during
the initial 6 months after chemotherapy. Approximately 41%
of patients receiving chemotherapy had no menstrual bleeding in the 6 months after the end of chemotherapy. A majority of patients who were not initially amenorrheic continued
to have menstrual bleeding. Time 0 is 6 months after the last
chemotherapy dose for participants in the initially amenorrheic and not initially amenorrheic groups. For comparison,
we have also included a line demonstrating the bleeding experience of those women who did not receive chemotherapy.
For these women, Time 0 is approximately 1 year after diagnosis (offset to account for the average length of chemotherapy and the 6-month period after chemotherapy needed to
determine amenorrhea).

times greater for women receiving tamoxifen compared
with those not receiving tamoxifen, and the odds of a 12month amenorrheic period increased by 6% for every
additional week of chemotherapy (OR, 1.06; 95% CI,
1.02-1.11).
Amenorrheic episodes of 24 months were also found
to be significantly associated with older age (P <.001),
BMI (P ¼ .043), age of first menstrual period (P ¼ .042),
tamoxifen use (P ¼ .005), and greater duration of chemotherapy (P <.001) after adjusting for other characteristics.
Compared with women aged 40 years, the odds of an
initial 24-month amenorrheic period were 0.01 (95% CI,
0.00-0.10) for women ages 20 to 34 years and 0.17 (95%
CI, 0.08-0.34) for women ages 35 to 39 years. Compared
with women of normal BMI, the odds of an initial 24month amenorrheic period were 2.22 (95% CI, 1.134.36) for overweight women and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.312.24) for obese women. Compared with women whose
menstrual cycles started at age 14 years, the odds of an
initial 24-month amenorrheic period were 0.95 (95% CI,
0.37-2.46) for those who began menstruating at age 11
years, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.14-0.86) for those who began at

Note that N is the number at risk at the beginning of the observation period (after chemotherapy for amenorrhea); n (%) is the number (percentage) of those
at risk who experience the event. For resumption of bleeding, % is the Kaplan-Meier estimate at 3 years. Not all women who experienced amenorrhea provided data after the amenorrheic period. Also note that resumption of bleeding does not necessarily indicate ‘‘regular’’ menses. In fact, of the 7 women who
bled after a 24-month period of amenorrhea, 4 experienced only 1 month of bleeding. On average, they bled only 14% of the subsequent months. Only
patients who returned >50% of the diaries were included in these analyses; therefore, the number of patients at risk (N) is not always consistent among the 3
cohorts (6, 12, and 24 months of amenorrhea).

12 years, and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.22-1.23) for those who
began at age 13 years. The odds of experiencing an initial
24-month period of CIA were 2.54 (95% CI, 1.32-4.88)
times greater for women receiving tamoxifen compared
with those not receiving tamoxifen, and the odds of a 24month amenorrheic period increased by 11% for every
additional week of chemotherapy (OR, 1.11; 95% CI,
1.05-1.17). The type of chemotherapy regimen was not
found to be significantly associated with 24 months of
CIA (P ¼ .309).
Recovery of menstrual bleeding after a 6-month
amenorrheic episode differed significantly among the regimens (P ¼ .002). Of those receiving AC, 32% of women
continued to be amenorrheic for the subsequent 3 years
compared with 43% and 77%, respectively, of women
receiving ACT and CMF (Fig. 2). The result remained
significant after adjustment for other covariates in a Cox
proportional hazards model (P ¼ .015). Women receiving
AC and ACT were most likely to resume menstruation,
whereas those receiving ACR and CMF were less likely
(Table 3). Other factors found to be significantly associated with the resumption of bleeding after 6 months of
CIA included younger age (P ¼ .007), age 13 years at
first menstrual period (P ¼ .041), and a shorter duration
of chemotherapy (P ¼ .009).
There was no significant difference noted among the
chemotherapy regimens for recovery after a 12-month period of CIA (P ¼ .500 unadjusted and P ¼ .430 adjusted).
At 3 years, 58% of the women treated with AC continued
to have CIA, compared with 68% of those treated with
ACT and 84% of those treated with CMF (Fig. 2). Only a
shorter duration of chemotherapy was found to be significantly associated with the resumption of bleeding (P ¼
.031).
Of the women who experienced a 2-year amenorrheic period, only 10% bled in the subsequent 3 years. All
patients who received CMF continued to be amenorrheic
for the subsequent 3 years after the initial 24-month episode of CIA. In patients receiving AC, CIA persisted in
74% compared with 86% of patients receiving ACT (Fig.
2). None of the 7 women who experienced subsequent
bleeding had regular menses; 4 bled in only 1 of the subsequent months.
In general, younger patients were less likely to experience CIA (Table 3). Less than 5% of women ages 20 to
34 years had prolonged CIA regardless of chemotherapy
type. The risk of CIA lasting more than 24 months was
11% in patients ages 35 to 39 years and 40% in patients
aged >39 years. The odds of a 24-month amenorrheic pe-

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first,
large prospective study aimed at examining the cessation
and resumption of menstrual bleeding in premenopausal

women receiving various currently used chemotherapy
regimens (including taxanes) for the treatment of breast
cancer. The incidence of CIA was substantial: 41% of
women experienced an initial 6-month period of amenorrhea after chemotherapy.
Variables such as patient age, dose intensity, cumulative dose, and duration of treatment have all been
reported as predictors of CIA in patients.4,14-17 We found
patient age to be a significant predictor of amenorrhea at
6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after chemotherapy. The odds of undergoing a 6-month period of CIA
were approximately 25 times greater for women aged 40
years compared with women aged 35 years. Only 11%
of patients ages 20 to 34 years experienced a 6-month period of amenorrhea after the completion of chemotherapy. This protective effect of younger age held for all types
of chemotherapy regimens.
Past studies suggest that chemotherapy dosing may
be an important factor in CIA, although to the best of our
knowledge the majority of research in this area has examined cyclophosphamide.15,17,18 Because the current study
was designed using the current standard chemotherapy
regimens, we do not have a wide range of either dose
intensities or cumulative doses of chemotherapy to
address the effect of dose on amenorrhea. From the chemotherapy regimens that we could examine, the rate of
menstrual bleeding recovery was less for women receiving
CMF compared with those treated with AC/ACT, despite
a similar initial amenorrheic rate after chemotherapy with
AC/ACT (34% vs 37-45%). There appeared to be a recovery period associated with the AC and ACT regimens
that did not occur with CMF. The addition of paclitaxel
to the AC regimen did not appear to significantly increase
the rates of CIA in this population.
Two recent retrospective studies have reported rates
of CIA in patients receiving anthracyclines and taxanes.
One study reported a 15% rate of long-term amenorrhea
of 12 months in patients receiving varying schedules of
ACT.19 In our study, the incidence of 12 months of CIA
among patients receiving ACT was 29%, using bleeding
diaries collected concurrently. Tham et al surveyed 191
patients who received AC or ACT and reported the 6month CIA rate to be 55% and 64%, respectively, for AC
and ACT.20 The authors indicated that menstruation
resumed in 29% and 38% of patients receiving AC and
ACT, respectively. However, the median length of followup after chemotherapy and the doses of the chemotherapies received were not reported. In the current study, we
also found that the addition of paclitaxel to AC resulted in

Cancer

a nonsignificant, but higher rate of 6 months of CIA
(37% vs 45% for AC and ACT, respectively). Approximately 68% and 57%, respectively, of these women
resumed bleeding in the subsequent 3 years. The number
of patients receiving docetaxel was fairly small and, as
such, definitive conclusions regarding the effect on docetaxel cannot be made from this study.
The routine use of tamoxifen in premenopausal
patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors can lead
to improvements in disease-free and overall survival.21 In
recent years, aromatase inhibitors have been shown to
have fewer side effects along with improvements in disease-free survival in postmenopausal women.22,23 A longer disease-free survival can occur with upfront or
sequential use of an aromatase inhibitor after 2 to 3 years
of tamoxifen. Unfortunately, aromatase inhibitors can
only be used in women who have undergone a natural,
medical, or surgical menopause. The results of the current
study demonstrate that, even if premenopausal patients
have been amenorrheic for 2 years after chemotherapy,
there is a possibility (approximately 10%) that bleeding
may resume. This supports the use of FSH, luteinizing
hormone, and estradiol levels to ascertain a patient’s menopausal status before any decision to switch from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor is made. However, prior
studies have suggested that these hormone levels can fluctuate greatly and may not be a true indicator of menopausal status.24,25 That is why longitudinal data regarding
menstrual cycling are critical to this discussion.
The results of our menstrual cycle data indicate that
only 10% of women had resumption of bleeding if they
were amenorrheic for 24 months after completing chemotherapy. None of the patients who received CMF resumed
bleeding. In more commonly used regimens such as AC
and ACT, approximately 15% to 26% of patients
resumed menstrual bleeding despite being amenorrheic
for 24 months. However, none of these women reported
regular periods. On average, these women had bleeding in
only 14% of the months after the amenorrheic period,
and in patients aged >40 years, approximately half of the
women who resumed menstrual bleeding reported only 1
month of bleeding in the following months. Given these
findings, it may be reasonable to switch patients to an aromatase inhibitor if they are biochemically postmenopausal
and have had at least a 24-month period of CIA, because
it is unlikely that they will ever resume regular menses.
Major strengths of this study are the prospective
design, the large sample size, the use of bleeding calendars
to document bleeding, and the extended follow-up

enabling the estimation of recovery of bleeding after CIA.
This is also to our knowledge the first prospective study to
report CIA in patients treated with AC and ACT. These
data are critical in understanding the ramifications of current chemotherapy regimens in the premenopausal
woman. CIA can have negative consequences such as
infertility, vasomotor symptoms, and premature bone
loss, as well as potential beneficial consequences, such as
improvement in overall survival.5-7 Given these consequences, this information regarding the true incidence
and time course of CIA is valuable for treatment planning
and the follow-up of patients receiving cytotoxic agents
for the treatment of breast cancer. More importantly, we
found that up to 25% of patients treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen can experience
resumption of menstrual bleeding even after a 2-year period of CIA. Therefore, it appears that biochemical testing
should be performed if there is any consideration of
switching to an aromatase inhibitor, even in patients with
prolonged periods of CIA. Further work correlating the
effects of CIA by treatment regimen on patients’ quality
of life will be important in educating premenopausal
patients. Such information will help patients and physicians weigh the risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer.
