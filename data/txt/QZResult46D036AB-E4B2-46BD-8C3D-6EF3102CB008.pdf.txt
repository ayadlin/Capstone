Abstract
The chemokine CXCL12/stromal cell–derived factor-1 and its receptor CXCR4 play a major role in tumor
invasion, proliferation, and metastasis. Recently, CXCR7 was identified as a novel, alternate receptor for
CXCL12 and CXCL11/I-TAC. Because both chemokines are expressed abundantly in human astrocytomas
and glioblastomas, we investigated the occurrence and function of both receptors in astroglial tumors. In situ,
CXCR7 is highly expressed on tumor endothelial, microglial, and glioma cells whereas CXCR4 has a much
more restricted localization; CXCL12 is often colocalized with CXCR7. CXCR7 transcription in tumor homogenates increased with malignancy. In vitro, CXCR7 was highly expressed in all glioma cell lines investigated
whereas CXCR4 was only scarcely transcribed on one of eight lines. In contrast, a tumor stem-like cell line
preferentially expressed CXCR4 which diminished upon differentiation, whereas CXCR7 increased drastically.
Stimulation of CXCR7-positive glioma cells (CXCR4- and CXCR3-negative) by CXCL12 induced transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2, indicating that the receptor is functionally active.
The phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 effectively inhibited Erk activation and suggests that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated indirectly. Whereas proliferation and
migration were little influenced, chemokine stimulation prevented camptothecin- and temozolomide-induced
apoptosis. The selective CXCR7 antagonist CCX733 reduced the antiapoptotic effects of CXCL12 as shown by
nuclear (Nicoletti) staining, caspase-3/7 activity assays, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Thus,
CXCR7 is a functional receptor for CXCL12 in astrocytomas/glioblastomas and mediates resistance to druginduced apoptosis. Whereas CXCR7 is found on “differentiated” glioma cells, the alternate receptor CXCR4 is
also localized on glioma stem-like cells. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3299–308. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Chemokines, a group of small (8–15 kDa) chemotactic
cytokines, and their receptors have been discovered as essential mediators of leukocyte migration in the immune system.
However, they also play a critical role in tumor initiation,
promotion, progression, and metastasis (1). The chemokine
CXCL12 (or stromal cell–derived factor-1) seems to be of particular importance in tumor biology, especially in tumor metastasis. Interaction of CXCL12 with its receptor CXCR4 that
is expressed on some tumor cells directs them to peripheral
tissues like lung, liver, lymph nodes, or bone marrow in
which the ligand is constitutively expressed (2). Furthermore,

the CXCL12/stromal cell–derived factor-1–CXCR4 axis promotes paracrine tumor growth, tumor cell invasiveness,
and tumor angiogenesis (3–6). Recently, a novel receptor
for CXCL12 has been identified, termed CXCR7/RDC1 (7, 8).
Aside from CXCL12, CXCR7 binds with 10-fold lower affinity
CXCL11/I-TAC (IFN-inducible T cell α chemoattractant)
which is also a ligand for CXCR3 (that is also targeted by
CXCL9/Mig and CXCL10/IP-10).
In healthy mouse, CXCR7 is expressed in cardiomyocytes,
osteocytes, and brain cells (9–11). CXCR7-deficient mice die
prenatally with severe heart defects that are also reported for
CXCL12 and CXCR4 knockout animals (10). In humans,
CXCR7 is—as far as we know—expressed on tumor-associated
blood vessels and on distinct malignant cells including
breast, lung, and prostate cancer cells (8, 12–14). The biological importance of CXCR7, its signal transduction, and further
effects apparently depend on the cell types investigated. In
breast cancer cells, CXCR7 activation fails to cause Ca2+ mobilization or cell migration, but provides growth advantage (8),
whereas in prostate cancer cells, CXCR7 expression is associated with enhanced adhesive and invasive activities in addition to increased survival (13).
Because CXCL12 is essential for brain development and
adult brain homeostasis by regulating neuronal migration
and neurogenesis (15), and is highly expressed in the embryonic

and adult brain, we investigated whether its newly discovered
receptor CXCR7 is also expressed in normal or malignant
human brain tissues. Previously, CXCL12 and CXCR4 have
been detected in human gliomas (3–5), but CXCR4 expression
seemed to be limited only to a very small subset of glioma cells
(6, 16, 17). Here, we show that CXCR7 is much higher and
broader expressed in astrocytoma and glioblastoma cells than
in normal brain tissue. CXCR4 is found on glioma stem-like
cells and is diminished upon differentiation, whereas CXCR7
is increased. Moreover, CXCR7 is functionally active in glioma
cell lines and inhibits apoptosis induced by camptothecin
and temozolomide.

Materials and Methods
Peptides and inhibitors. Recombinant human cytokines/
factors were from Immunotools, Tebu-bio, or Chemicon.
U0126 and camptothecin were from Biomol, U73122 and
KT5720 were from Calbiochem and were dissolved in DMSO,
whereas CCX733 was from ChemoCentryx. Temozolomide
(Sigma-Aldrich) was adjusted to stocks of 20 mg/mL in
DMSO; the final concentration was 400 μg/mL.
Cell culture and tissue samples. Surgically dissected human malignant and normal brain samples were obtained in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, with approval from the ethics committee. Human glioma cell lines
were from Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg,
Germany) or cultivated from tumors in DMEM (Invitrogen)
plus 10% FCS (18); other cell types were obtained as described (19). Short-term glioma cell cultures were cultivated
in DMEM plus 10% FCS (primary cultures) or in neurosphere
medium (20) plus 10 ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF), and 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factors (EGF; ref. 21;
glioma spheres). The glioma stem-like cell lines 25/07 (with/
without leukemia-inhibitory factor, LIF) were cultured over
1 y to enrich cells with self-renewal capacities. These cell
lines were characterized by the formation of neurospheres,
the ability to survive and proliferate under stem cell conditions and to differentiate into cells of different lineages (astroglial, neuronal, and oligodendroglial). For differentiation,
cells were dissociated, recovered for 3 d with neurosphere
medium containing bFGF and EGF (−/+LIF) and changed
to neurosphere medium with 10% FCS.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was isolated
with Trizol (Invitrogen), digested by DNase, cDNA was synthesized and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed (19) using TaqMan primer probes (Applied Biosystems): hGAPDH (Hs99999905_m1), hCXCL11 (Hs00171138_m1),
hCXCL12 (Hs00171022_m1), hCXCR3 (Hs00171041_m1),
hCXCR4 (Hs00607978_s1), hCXCR7 (Hs00664172_s1), hGFAP
(Hs00157674_m1), hSox2 (Hs 00602736_s1), hMusashi1
(Hs 00237052_m1). Five nonmalignant brain specimens, seven
astrocytomas (grade 1), six astrocytomas (grade 2), seven astrocytomas (grade 3), and up to 14 glioblastomas (WHO grade
4) were analyzed. Cycles of thresholds (CT) were determined
with an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system and
ΔCT values = CT gene of interest − CT GAPDH calculated.
ΔCT = 3.33 corresponds to one magnitude lower gene expres-

sion compared with GAPDH. For each gene, logarithmic linear
dependence of CT values from copy numbers was verified by
using different amounts of cDNA.
Immunohistochemistry/cytochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed (22) with cryostat sections fixed
with ice-cold acetone/methanol (1:1), blocking with Sudan
black and with 0.5% glycine/0.5% bovine serum albumin,
and incubation with primary (overnight, 4°C) and secondary
antibodies (1 h, 37°C). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole. Primary antibodies were antiCXCL12 (rabbit, 1:100; Abcam), anti-CXCR4 (rabbit, 1:100;
Imgenex, or goat, 1:500; Abcam), anti-CXCR7 (rabbit; 1:50
or 1:100, Abcam: ab12780 and ab 72100), anti-glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP; mouse monoclonal, 1:100; DAKO), anti–
Iba-1 (goat, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti–MIB-1
(mouse monoclonal, 1:100; DAKO; MIB = made in Borstel,
corresponding to Ki-67), anti-Pecam (goat, 1:100; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit
IgG Alexa Fluor 555-labeled, donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa
fluor 488-labeled, goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488labeled, and donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 488-labeled
and donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 555-labeled (Invitrogen;
diluted 1:1,000). For costainings, mixtures of primary and
secondary antibodies of different species were applied simultaneously. Costainings with two rabbit antibodies had
an additional blocking step with donkey anti-rabbit F(ab)′
fragments (Dianova) following the first primary and secondary antibody incubations. Glioma stem-like cells were
fixed with acetone and stained as above with anti-βIII tubulin (mouse monoclonal, 1:500; AbD Serotec) and anti-GFAP
(mouse monoclonal, 1:100; DAKO); goat anti-mouse IgG
Alexa Fluor 488 served as secondary antibody.
Stimulation of cells. For kinase phosphorylation analysis,
A764 and U343 glioma cells were washed serum-free and
stimulated in DMEM with 1% bovine serum albumin. 25/07
glioma stem-like cells were kept in neurosphere medium
without bFGF and EGF for 36 h prior to stimulation and
stimulated in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% BSA. Kinase inhibitors
were applied and preincubated for 1 h before adding the stimulators. CCX733 was preincubated for 30 min (for caspase3/7 activity assay, 10 nmol/L) or applied simultaneously with
other stimuli (Nicoletti staining, 100 nmol/L). All inhibitor
concentrations were maintained during experiments. Camptothecin and temozolomide stimulations were performed in
DMEM plus 0.2% FCS (A764 and U343) or in neurosphere
medium with bFGF and EGF.
Western blotting. Western blot experiments were performed as described (23). Lysates from 25/07 glioma stem-like
cells were adjusted to ∼5,000 cells/lane; otherwise, 5 μg of protein was applied. Blots were incubated with anti-CXCR7 (rabbit, 1:500; Abcam), reblotting with anti–caveolin-1 (N-20,
rabbit, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pErk1/2
(Thr202/Tyr204; 1:500), anti-pAkt (1:350), or anti-pp38 (1:250;
Cell Signaling Technology), reprobed after stripping with
methanol and 0.1 mol/L glycine/HCl buffer (pH 2.5) with
anti-Erk2 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Akt
(1:300; Cell Signaling Technology). For analysis of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, blots were incubated

CXCR7 in Glioblastomas

Figure 1. Transcription and fluorescence-immunohistochemistry of chemokine receptors, their ligands, and cellular markers in human astroglial tumors and
normal brain. Top, solid astrocytomas of different WHO grades [7 WHO grades 1 and 3, 6 grade 2, and 14 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)] and five
normal brain tissue samples were analyzed for mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR. ΔCT values to GAPDH are given; ΔCT = 3.33 corresponds to one
magnitude. CXCR4 expression shows great variations in homogenates. CXCR7 is particularly elevated in high-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas.
Bottom, costainings (examples) of CXCR7 (red/blue, nuclear counterstain) with CXCR4 and CXCL12 or cell type–specific markers (green) in tissue sections.
In normal brain, CXCR7 and CXCR4 expression are restricted to Pecam-positive endothelial cells/capillaries. Here, the receptors are often colocalized.
Their ligand, CXCL12, is often found bound to the capillaries and its fluorescence signals often merge with that of CXCR7, less than with CXCR4. In
glioblastomas, CXCR7 expression is found throughout samples with varying intensities. CXCR7 is localized on endothelial cells, but in particular on tumor
cells positive for the proliferation marker MIB/Ki67 and in GFAP-positive regions; also, Iba1-positive microglial cells/monocytes are positive. CXCL12
fluorescence frequently merged with that of CXCR7, indicating that the receptor is often occupied by its ligand. CXCR4 was only detected on a few cells and
is rarely colocalized with CXCR7. Antibody control is shown for costaining with antibodies of the same species; other controls were negative.

reprobed with GAPDH (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Migration and proliferation assays. Migration was analyzed in wound-healing assays (Scratch assay) in DMEM +
0.2% FCS (23). Proliferation was determined with subconfluent cells after 24 h in DMEM containing 0.2% FCS BSA by
the measurement of DNA with CyQuant reagent (18) and

normalized to absolute cell number (three individual dishes
for each stimulus).
Apoptosis and caspase assays. For modified Nicoletti
staining (24), cells were seeded on poly-D-lysine–coated coverslips, grown overnight, and stimulated in DMEM + 0.2%
FCS (24 or 48 h). After rinsing with PBS, cells were fixed with
ice-cold acetone/methanol (1:1, for 10 min), washed, and

and counted by a person without bias. For caspase activity
assays, cells were seeded on 35 mm six-well plates, precultivated for 48 h, and stimulated in DMEM + 0.2% FCS for 48 h.
Caspase-3/7 activity was measured with a homogenous luminescent assay (Caspase-Glo, Promega). The luminescence
signal was normalized to absolute cell numbers that were
counted in parallel with a flow cytometer (Galaxy Argon Plus,
DAKO).
Statistical analysis. Values are given as means ± SD. Statistical significance was analyzed by a two-tailed Student's
t test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).

Results
CXCR7 is highly expressed in astrocytomas and
glioblastomas in situ. In an initial step, we investigated
the expression of the chemokine receptors, CXCR7 and
CXCR4, as well as their ligands, CXCL12 and CXCL11, in ma-

lignant and nonmalignant brain samples by quantitative
RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1). CXCR4 transcription showed great variations in normal brain and astrocytoma
tissues, but did not significantly change with malignancy.
In contrast, CXCR7 transcription significantly increased in
high-grade astrocytomas as compared with normal brain tissues. Transcription of the ligands was comparable or even a
bit lower in tumor samples than in normal brain.
To identify cells that express chemokine receptors in astroglial tumors, we performed fluorescence coimmunostainings of CXCR7 together with nuclei, CXCR4, CXCL12,
proliferation, and cell type–specific markers (Fig. 1, bottom).
In normal brain, CXCR4 and CXCR7 were localized mainly on
endothelial cells positive for their marker Pecam (platelet/
endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, CD31). On capillaries,
both receptors were frequently colocalized. The ligand
CXCL12 was found near the endothelial receptors (and its
immunofluorescence often merged with that of the receptors, in particular with that of CXCR7), but also at other sites

Figure 2. Expression of chemokine receptors and ligands in cultivated human glioma and other cells as measured by quantitative RT-PCR. A, CXCR4
transcription was absent or very low (one of eight) in glioma cell lines, whereas CXCR7 was highly transcribed in all glioma cells. Both receptors were highly
transcribed in human endothelial cells (HUVEC) and moderately in the THP-1 monocyte cell line. CXCR7 is absent in breast (MDA-MB 231) and colon
(HT29) carcinoma cells, CXCR4 only in breast tumor cells (of the malignant cells tested). The ligands CXCL11 and CXCL12 are transcribed in some glioma
cells, in monocytes and endothelial cells at moderate levels. B, the A764 glioma cell line chosen for functional experiments transcribes CXCR7, but
not CXCR4 or CXCR3; CXCL11 is transcribed at moderate levels, but not CXCL12. A764 cells are GFAP positive. Means ± SD are given from n = 3
independent RNA isolations from different subcultures. C, Western blots corroborate the results of CXCR7 transcription on glioma cells (protein bands
at 50 kDa), loading was controlled by reblotting with caveolin-1 (n = 2).

CXCR7 in Glioblastomas

Figure 3. A, CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression in glioma spheres and corresponding primary cultures of two individual glioblastoma samples. Cells were
grown separately in neurosphere medium or in DMEM + 10% FCS, and RNA isolated after 10 to 15 d. CXCR4 was not detectable or was transcribed 10-fold
lower in primary compared with sphere cultures, whereas CXCR7 expression was up to one magnitude higher in primary compared with corresponding
glioma sphere cultures. B, expression patterns of CXCR4, CXCR7, and CXCL12 in undifferentiated and differentiated 25/07 glioma stem-like cells
(generated without/with 10 ng/mL LIF over 1 y). Differentiation was induced by 10% FCS, and cells compared by quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry.
Differentiated cells expressed glial (GFAP) and neuronal (βIII tubulin) markers, whereas stem cell markers (Musashi1 and Sox2) were decreased. In both
independent experiments, differentiation decreased CXCR4 expression by about one magnitude and increased CXCR7 expression by one to several
magnitudes. CXCL12 was moderately upregulated (n = 2 individual subcultures).

in the parenchyma. In glioblastomas, tumor vessels were also
CXCR4- and CXCR7-positive. However, most CXCR7 immunoreactivity was found in GFAP-positive (glial fibrillary acidic
protein, astroglial-marker) regions and on proliferating cells
(proliferation marker MIB = Ki67). Iba1-positive cells were
also positive for CXCR7 (Iba-1: macrophage/microglial-marker).
Fluorescence of CXCL12-staining typically merged with that of
CXCR7 (green and red fluorescence yielding yellow), indicating
that CXCL12 is frequently bound to CXCR7. The alternate
receptor CXCR4 was detected on only few cells often clustered
in groups, within the tumor and rarely colocalized with CXCR7
(except capillaries). On some tumor cells, CXCL12 was also
detected in the vicinity of CXCR4, but fluorescence merged less
(as compared with CXCR7).
In normal brain, CXCR7 and CXCR4 are mainly localized
only on endothelial cells. In glioblastomas, CXCR7 is particularly expressed on the tumor cells and CXCR4 on a very
small subpopulation of them; tumor endothelial cells and
macrophages are also CXCR7-immunopositive.
CXCR7 is highly expressed in glioma cells in vitro. Next,
we determined CXCR7 in cultivated glioma cells (Fig. 2). All
eight glioma cell lines investigated highly transcribed CXCR7

mRNA, whereas CXCR4 was hardly detectable in only one of
them (Fig. 2A). CXCR7 transcription in glioma cells
was typically 20- to 100-fold higher than in endothelial cells
(human umbilical vein endothelial cells) or the monocytic cell
line THP-1; a breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and colon carcinoma (HT29) cell line proved to be CXCR7-negative. CXCR7expression was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot
experiments yielding specific bands at ∼50 kDa in all cells with
high mRNA transcription (Fig. 2C). CXCR4 mRNA was detected at high levels in cultivated endothelial as well as monocytic cells, at moderate levels in the CXCR7-negative breast
cancer cells. The CXCR7 ligands, CXCL11 and CXCL12, were
transcribed by some glioma cell lines and also by the monocytic cell line as well as by endothelial cells (Fig. 2A). CXCR7
expression could not be regulated by hypoxia (5% O2) nor
by stimulation with its ligands, cytokines (tumor necrosis
factor-α, IFNγ, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6), or growth factors (EGF, bFGF, VEGF) in A764 glioma cells (data not shown).
Functional studies were then performed with the glioma
cell lines A764 and U343 that express high levels of CXCR7,
but not CXCR4 nor CXCR3; they do not transcribe the ligand
CXCL12, but CXCL11 at low to moderate levels (Fig. 2B and C).

Figure 4. Signal transduction of CXCR7 in human A764/U343 glioma and glioma stem-like cells. Left, stimulation with 1 nmol/L of CXCL12 in serum-free
medium induces transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2 in A764 and U343 glioma cells and of Erk1/2 as well as
Akt in glioma stem-like cells (15 min). Reblots with antibodies to nonphosphorylated kinases ensures equal loading; EGF was used as a positive control.
Right, in A764 cells, Erk phosphorylation after 20 min could be inhibited by preincubation with U0126 (100 μmol/L, 1 h), a selective inhibitor of the
upstream kinase to Erk, MEK; controls with vehicle DMSO. Erk phosphorylation after 20 min could also be inhibited by preincubation with 10 μmol/L of
U73122, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, but only slightly with 2 μmol/L of KT5720, an inhibitor of protein kinase A. Stimulation
with 1 nmol/L of CXCL12 does not induce activation of p38 or Akt. Blots are representative examples of at least three individual stimulations, each
with different chemoluminescence systems and exposure times that could account for the different relative intensities between individual blots.

Short-term glioma stem-like cell cultures show higher

obtained in parallel from glioblastoma samples in neurosphere and conventional medium. In neurosphere medium,

cells formed free-floating aggregates within a few days and
were analyzed after 10 to 15 days. In conventional cultures
in medium plus 10% FCS, cells grew adherent and were harvested after the first subcultivation. Whereas glioma sphere

CXCR7 in Glioblastomas

Figure 6. CXCL12-mediated effects on apoptosis in human glioma and glioma stem-like cells. A, apoptosis induced by camptothecin (30 μg/mL) and
temozolomide (400 μg/mL) is significantly reduced by 1 nmol/L of CXCL12; cells were stimulated in DMEM + 0.2% FCS for 24 h (A764) or 48 h (U343)
and apoptotic nuclei (arrows) were counted. This effect could be blocked by simultaneous incubation with the CXCR7 antagonist CCX733 (100 nmol/L;
n = 4). *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001; B, camptothecin-induced (50 and 30 μg/mL) cleavage of PARP is rigorously reduced by costimulation with 1 nmol/L
of CXCL12 (24 h, DMEM + 0.2% FCS); camptothecin solvent DMSO serves as control. C, caspase-3/7 activity in A764 cells (with high CXCR7 transcription)
induced by camptothecin (30 μg/mL) is reduced by coincubation with 1 nmol/L of CXCL12; the CXCR7 antagonist CCX733 completely abolishes this
antiapoptotic effect (cells stimulated in DMEM + 0.2% FCS for 24 h). **, P < 0.01. D, camptothecin-induced caspase-3/7 activity in glioma stem-like cells is
not significantly reduced by CXCL12 (24 h). In particular, apoptosis cannot be reduced in cells with very low transcription (qRT-PCR) of CXCR7
but high transcription of CXCR4 (those precultivated with 10 ng/mL **, of LIF).

preparations, in conventional primary cultures, CXCR4 transcription was reduced to the tenth part or were not even detectable
(Fig. 3A). In contrast, CXCR7 expression was more than one magnitude higher in conventional primary than in corresponding
sphere cultures. Thus, stem cell–favoring conditions (neurosphere medium) preserved CXCR4 expression whereas CXCR7
was markedly higher under conventional culture conditions.
CXCR4 on glioma stem-like cells diminishes upon
differentiation whereas CXCR7 increases. The influence of
differentiation was investigated with the glioma stem-like
cell line 25/07, which was established by long-term culture
from a glioblastoma in the absence or presence of LIF. Like
glioma spheres in short-term culture, these cells showed high
CXCR4 and low CXCR7 transcription. Upon differentiation
with 10% FCS, CXCR4 diminished and CXCR7 increased, in

particular, in LIF-precultivated cells; here, CXCR7 transcription reached similar values as found in glioma cell
lines (Fig. 3B). Differentiation also strongly increased the astroglial marker GFAP; the neuronal marker βIII-tubulin was
detectable on a small number of cells. On the contrary, the
stem cell markers Musashi1 and Sox2 decreased with differentiation. Thus, CXCR4 is found more on glioma stem-like
cells whereas CXCR7 is mainly expressed on differentiated
tumor cells.
CXCR7 activation induces phosphorylation of Erk1/2. To
assess that CXCR7 is a functional receptor on glioma cells,
A764 as well as U343 cells were stimulated with CXCL12,
and the phosphorylation of kinases was investigated by
Western blot experiments. In both cell lines, stimulation
of CXCR7 resulted in a transient phosphorylation of Erk1/2

(extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Fig. 4, left), but neither
of the kinases Akt nor p38 (Fig. 4, bottom right). This phosphorylation was successfully blocked by the highly selective
inhibitor U0126 of the upstream ERK kinase (MEK; Fig. 4, top
right), indicating that CXCR7 transduces signals via MEK/
ERK signal transduction pathway. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway occurred not directly,
but apparently via phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase
C because the selective inhibitor U73122 abolished Erk1/2
phosphorylation; the protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720 exhibited fewer inhibitory effects (Fig. 4, middle right; both inhibitors showed no effects of EGF-induced phosphorylation
that occurs directly via receptor adapter proteins; data not
shown). As possibly activated transcription factors, we investigated the phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response elementbinding protein, activating transcription factor 2, Elk-1, and
the nuclear localization of NF-κB; however, none were measurably induced/activated (see Supplementary Material, Supplementary Fig. S1). Stimulation of glioma stem-like cells
(line 25/07 without LIF) with CXCL12 yielded weak phosphorylation of Akt as well as of Erk1/2 (Fig. 4, bottom left).
These results show that CXCR7 in glioma cells signals preferentially via protein kinase C, which subsequently activates
the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase pathway. In
glioma stem-like cells, alternative pathways may also contribute to signaling.
CXCR7 activation inhibits apoptosis. As biological responses, chemokine receptor activation often induces chemotaxis and/or proliferation. When A764 and U343 glioma
cells were exposed to 1 nmol/L of CXCL12 in a woundhealing assay, no significant migratory effects were observed
(Fig. 5A). Also, CXCL12 did not significantly increase proliferation as did EGF or FCS, neither in A764 (Fig. 5B) nor in
U343 cells (data not shown).
However, CXCL12 inhibited the apoptosis of glioma cells
after exposure to camptothecin and temozolomide as investigated with three different methods: as determined by modified Nicoletti staining experiments, CXCL12 diminished
camptothecin- and temozolomide-induced apoptosis significantly to about one third or one fourth (depending on time/
agent) in A764 and U343 cells (Fig. 6A). The receptor specificity could be proven by simultaneous stimulation with a
specific, nonpeptide antagonist for CXCR7, CCX733 (25),
which completely restored the apoptotic response to camptothecin (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, cleavage of PARP was
efficiently reduced by CXCL12 in A764 cells (Fig. 6B). Moreover, camptothecin-induced activation of caspase-3/-7 was
significantly inhibited when cells were coincubated with
CXCL12; again, the CXCR7 antagonist CCX733 completely
abolished the antiapoptotic effect (Fig. 6C).
In contrast, CXCL12 had no significant antiapoptotic effect
in glioblastoma stem-like cells (Fig. 6D). CXCL12 did not (or
insignificantly) alter camptothecin-induced caspase-3/-7 activation. In summary, CXCR7 is a functionally active CXCL12
receptor on glioma cells and mediates antiapoptotic effects
whereas receptor expression in glioma stem-like cells is low
and therefore lacks pronounced CXCR7 effects.

Discussion
Among chemokine receptors, CXCR4 has been found to be
most widely expressed in multiple types of tumors and has
been shown to be implicated in tumor cell invasion, metastasis, as well as in survival and proliferation (2, 5). Less information is available on the occurrence and biological role of
the newly discovered second receptor for the CXCR4-ligand
CXCL12, i.e., CXCR7 (8, 12–14). Reportedly, human gliomas
and astrocytomas produce several chemokines like CCL2/
MCP-1, CXCL8/interleukin-8, CXCL10, CXCL11/I-TAC,
CXCL12/stromal cell–derived factor-1, and CXCL16 (19, 26).
Their corresponding receptors have been identified either on
astrocytoma/glioma cells (or subsets), on tumor-infiltrating
microglial cells/macrophages, on tumor endothelial cells, or
on tumor-infiltrating neural stem cells (17, 27).
CXCR4 has been originally described as a major widespread receptor on glioma cells (3, 4), and its occurrence
and localization were addressed in several previous studies.
WHO grade 3 and 4 glial tumors robustly express CXCR4, and
the expression levels correlate with the magnetic resonance
imaging–based finding of a diffuse and more extensive disease process in the brain (28). Whereas CXCL12 is often produced in the pseudopalisading cells and the proliferating
microvessels (29), CXCR4 expression is found on tumor endothelial and tumor cells, often in areas of necrosis and angiogenesis (3, 29); probably also due to CXCR4 induction by
hypoxia (29). However, CXCL12 and CXCR4 are also colocalized on tumor cells (5). Furthermore, CXCR4 was found on
glioma tumor stem cells and on neural stem cells that invade
this tumor (6, 16, 17, 30). In fact, neural stem cells display
extensive tropism for gliomas (31), which seems to be mediated by CXCL12 production of the tumor cells and the
corresponding CXCR4 receptors on stem cells (16). In our
own investigation (which was not focused on CXCR4), we
could sustain some of these findings (compare Fig. 1 and Results), but find a bit more restricted localization of CXCR4
in situ. The alternate CXCL12 receptor, CXCR7, occurs on tumor endothelial cells and tumor cells, here only rarely together with CXCR4. Taken together, both receptors occur
in astrocytomas/glioblastomas in situ on tumor endothelial
cells; CXCR4 is found on certain subsets of glioma cells
and on stem-like cells whereas CXCR7 has a more extensive
distribution on (mostly) other parts of glioma cells and on
tumor-infiltrating microglial cells.
In vitro, we detected low CXCR4 expression on only one of
eight glioma cell lines tested. In contrast, CXCR7 was transcribed on all glioma cell lines screened. Glioma cell lines
are generated by several passages in medium containing
FCS, conditions that are unfavorable for tumor stem cells.
These can be cultivated under serum-free conditions (neurosphere medium) in the presence of bFGF and EGF (20, 21). In
short-term cultures comparing these stem cell–favoring and
conventional culture conditions, glioma spheres showed
markedly higher CXCR4 and lower CXCR7 expression than
primary cultures in FCS-containing medium. In accordance,
a glioma stem-like cell line showed high CXCR4 and low
CXCR7 expression. FCS-induced differentiation drastically

CXCR7 in Glioblastomas

diminished CXCR4 expression and induced CXCR7. Effects
were particularly high in glioma stem-like cells precultivated
with LIF. It seems that the addition of this cytokine improves
the preservation of the stem cell character compared with
bFGF and EGF alone. Thus, in situ and in vitro findings suggest that CXCR7 is expressed on “differentiated” glioma/
astrocytoma cells, whereas CXCR4 is found more on glioma
stem cells.
Thus, CXCR7 is a frequent receptor in glioblastomas in situ
and in particular on glioma cells in vitro. Thus far, it is unclear to what extent CXCR7 could be considered as a signaling receptor when expressed alone or in combination with
CXCR4 (8, 32). Recent studies with hCXCR7-transfected
HEK293 cells and rat vascular smooth muscle cells that endogenously express CXCR7 (33) show a “nonclassical positive
signaling” of CXCR7 through β-arrestin–mediated (processes
that last for >10 minutes), but not through Gαi-mediated mechanisms (although other G protein–mediated ones were not
excluded). In glioma cells that express only CXCR7, we could
detect limited but pronounced effects upon CXCL12 stimulation: a transient phosphorylation of Erk 1/2 and an inhibition
of camptothecin- and temozolomide-induced apoptosis were
observed, but no effects on cyclic AMP production, proliferation, or chemotaxis as often reported for CXCR4 (5, 34). Erk
phosphorylation could be reduced by the phosphoinositidespecific phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122, but not by the
protein kinase A inhibitor, KT5720. The extent of the involvement of β-arrestin–mediated mechanisms and other mechanisms (which might explain the different activation
kinetics) should be investigated in further detailed studies.
It is tempting to speculate that some of the previously

reported effects of CXCL12 on glioma cells, such as phosphorylation of kinases, induction of gene expression, or prevention of apoptosis, were at least in part mediated through
CXCR7 (4, 35, 36).
Thus, tumor (or neural) stem cells seem to be attracted
and nourished by glioma-produced CXCL12 via CXCR4,
whereas the bulk of differentiated glioma cells is protected
from apoptosis via CXCR7, which may also have a CXCL12binding function to a certain extent. The interplay of CXCR4
and CXCR7 in tumor endothelial cells and CXCR7 function
on tumor-invading microglial cells shall be elucidated in future experiments.
