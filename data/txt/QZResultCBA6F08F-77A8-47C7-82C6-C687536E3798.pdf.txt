Abstract

Author Manuscript

The cell of origin of tumors and the the factors determining the cell of origin remain unclear. In
this study, a mouse model of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-B ALL/
LBL) was established by retroviral transduction of Myc genes (N-Myc or c-Myc) into mouse bone
marrow cells. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibited the highest susceptibility to N-Mycinduced pre-B ALL/LBL versus lymphoid progenitors, myeloid progenitors and committed
progenitor B cells. N-Myc was able to induce pre-B ALL/LBL directly from progenitor B cells in
the absence of Ink4a and Arf. Arf was expressed higher in progenitor B cells than Ink4a. In
addition, N-Myc induced pre-B ALL/LBL from Arf−/− progenitor B cells, suggesting that Arf
plays a predominant role in determining the cell of origin of pre-B ALL/LBL. Tumor cells derived
from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells exhibited a higher rate of proliferation and were more

chemoresistant than those derived from wild-type HSCs. Furthermore, the Mdm2 inhibitor
Nutlin-3 restored p53 and induced massive apoptosis in mouse pre-B ALL/LBL cells derived from
Ink4a/Arf−/− cells and human B-ALL cell lines lacking Ink4a and Arf expression, suggesting that
Mdm2 inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of Ink4a/Arf−/− B-ALL/
LBL, such as is frequently found in Ph+ ALL and relapsed ALL. Collectively, these findings
indicate that Ink4a and Arf are critical determining factors of the cell of origin and the therapeutic
sensitivity of Myc-induced lymphoid tumors.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Understanding the cell of origin of tumors is important not only for elucidating detailed
mechanisms of tumorigenesis but also for characterizing the context in which tumor cells
develop, both of which provide useful information that can inform preventive therapy and
therapeutic strategies in the clinical setting (Visvader 2011). Stem cells and multi-potent
progenitor cells are believed to be prone to tumors because their cellular characteristics are
similar to tumor cells. We recently demonstrated that well-differentiated osteosarcomas arise
from immature bone marrow stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, as the cell of
origin, in a mouse model (Shimizu et al 2010). However, it remains unresolved whether the
cell of origin of hematopoietic malignancies, such as B cell lymphoid tumors composed of
differentiated tumor cells, is derived from stem cells, progenitor cells or committed
(differentiated) cells (Cobaleda and Sanchez-Garcia 2009). Furthermore, to date, only a few
studies have compared the characteristics of tumor cells derived from distinct cells of origin.

Author Manuscript

Deregulated expression of Myc oncogenes (c-Myc, N-Myc and L-Myc) is frequently found in
solid tumors as well as hematopoietic tumors, and is often associated with a poor prognosis
(Meyer and Penn 2008). Myc is a potent oncogene that can directly induce hematopoietic
tumors such as Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid leukemia
(ALL) in mouse models (Adams et al 1985, Luo et al 2005, Kawagoe et al 2007). In Eμ-Myc
transgenic mice, animals develop lymphoid tumors that are likely derived from committed B
cells, since Myc expression in this model is controlled by the immunogloblin enhancerpromoter (Adams et al 1985). On the other hand, enhanced expression of c-Myc in fetal liver
cells, including mainly hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, induces committed B cell
lymphoma (Hemann et al 2005). Thus, stem cells, progenitor cells and differentiated cells
could be the cell of origin for lymphoid tumors induced by Myc.
To clarify the cell of origin of hematopoietic tumors, we introduced the Myc oncogene into
various fractions of mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs). Both HSCs and
committed progenitor B cells were able to serve as the cell of origin for precursor B acute
lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-B ALL/LBL) induced by Myc, but the development
of pre-B ALL/LBL directly from progenitor B cells was subject to certain molecular
limitations. Furthermore, the therapeutic outcomes were different depending on the cell of

origin, even though the tumor cells were similar in terms of immunophenotype and
histopathology. Our findings implicate a novel therapeutic concept for the treatment of preB ALL/LBL derived from distinct cells of origin.

Results
Myc rapidly induces pre-B ALL/LBLin immature BM-MNCs

We attempted to establish the mouse hematopoietic tumor model using BM-MNCs from the
adult mouse. We used a conventional method based on the BM transplantation assay
because it is easier to establish tumors with short-term latency and to distinguish cell
subpopulations by differentiation markers. Given that N-Myc recently has been reported to
have more tumorigenic activity than c-Myc in hematopoietic tumor (Kawagoe et al 2007),
we first used N-Myc for tumor induction. Retroviral vectors for N-Myc and N-Myc lacking
the Myc Box II (ΔMBII) domain, an important region for transactivation, were constructed
(Supplementary Figure 1a). BM-MNCs were isolated from mice after 5-FU treatment, which
enriches immature cells, and then infected with retroviral vectors. Infected cells were
injected intravenously into lethally irradiated mice (Supplementary Figure 1b). Six weeks
after transplantation, GFP-positive cells and the number of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) in mice transplanted with N-Myc-transduced BM-MNCs were significantly
higher than mice transplanted with control- or ΔMBII-transduced cells (Figure 1a and d). All
mice transplanted with N-Myc-transduced BM-MNCs died after approximately 2 months
(Figure 1b). On the other hand, mice transplanted with control- or ΔMBII-transduced cells
showed no signs of tumor growth over a period of 300 days. Tumor-bearing mice had
enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) and thymus and exhibited splenomegaly (Figure 1c). As seen
by H&E staining, tissue destruction was readily apparent in BM, LNs and liver that had been
invaded and were occupied by tumor cells (Figure 1d). Flow cytometry analysis showed that
almost all tumor cells were negative for the myeloid markers Mac1 and Gr1, positive for the
B cell markers B220 and CD19, and positive-to-negative for the precursor B cell marker
CD43 (CD43+, pro-B; CD43−, pre-B), and tumor cells were also negative for the mature B
cell marker IgM (Figure 1e). Based on histopathology and immunophenotype, the tumors
were classified as pre-B ALL/LBL (Morse et al 2002). We further found that transplantation
of c-Myc-transduced BM-MNCs could also induce lymphoid tumor showing similar latency
and immunophenotype to N-Myc-induced pre-B ALL/LBL (Supplementary Figure 1a, c and
d). Collectively, these results suggest that both N-Myc and c-Myc commonly induce pre-B
ALL/LBL in proliferating immature BM-MNCs.

HSCs exhibits the highest susceptibility to Myc-induced pre-B ALL/LBL, and B220+ tumor
cells can serve as the tumor-initiating cells for secondary tumors
HSCs give rise to common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and myeloid progenitors (MPs).
CLPs are differentiated to committed progenitor B cells that ultimately become mature B
cells (Supplementary Figure 2a). To identify the cell of origin of Myc-induced pre-B ALL/
LBL, we separated 3 main populations, HSCs, MPs and CLPs in N-Myc-transduced BM
(GFP+) cells (Figure 2a). MPs (61.9%) constituted the greatest subpopulation in N-Myctransduced BM cells. Sorted cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice with
supportive BM-MNCs. Based on limiting dilution analysis, as few as 100 HSCs were

sufficient to induce Pre-B ALL/LBL, whereas more than 1,000 CLPs and 10,000 MPs were
necessary to induce tumors, and these had longer latencies than HSCs-derived tumors
(Table.1). Tumor cells and tissues from mice transplanted with HSCs had a similar
immunophenotype (B220+ CD19+ CD43+/− IgM −) and similar histopathology to those
derived from N-Myc-transduced bulk BM-MNCs (Figure 2b and c). All mice that were
injected with CLPs and 2 of the mice transplanted with MPs developed pre-B ALL/LBL
(Supplementary Figure 2b and c). The tumor cells of one mouse transplanted with MPs were
positive for Gr-1 and slightly positive for CD3 and B220. Although the difference of the
frequency in numbers of tumor-initiating cells between HSCs and MPs was statistically
significant (P<0.01), the difference of the frequency in those cells between HSCs and CLPs
was not (P=0.261). However, the frequency of tumor initiating cells was 3-fold higher in
HSCs (1:184) than in CLPs (1:558). N-Myc did not simply enrich HSCs after retroviral
transduction because the populations of N-Myc-transduced HSCs, CLPs and MPs were
similar to control cells infected with empty vector (Supplementary Figure 2d). Collectively,
these results suggest that HSCs are the most likely candidate for the cell of origin of Mycinduced pre-B ALL/LBL in immature BM-MNCs.

Author Manuscript

We next performed secondary transplantation of pre-B ALL/LBL tumor cells. Interestingly,
none of the tumor cells derived from N-Myc-transduced HSCs expressed both the HSC
markers c-kit and sca-1 (Figure 2d). Therefore, GFP+B220+ BM-MNCs from tumor-bearing
mice were sorted and transplanted into sublethally-irradiated mice (Figure 2e). Mice that
received a secondary transplant of GFP+B220+ cells developed pre-B ALL/LBL with
shorter latency than the primary tumor (Table 2). The frequency of tumor-initiating cells
was 1:216 based on limiting dilution analysis. These results suggest that there are tumorinitiating cells capable of developing secondary tumors within the B220+ cell population in
the mouse pre-B ALL/LBL model.
Committed progenitor B cells can serve as the cell of origin of Myc-induced pre-B
ALL/LBL in the absence of Ink4a and Arf
To clarify whether committed progenitor B cells can be the cell of origin of N-Myc-induced
pre-B ALL/LBL, BM-MNCs were isolated from non-treated mice and then infected with the
retroviral expression vector for N-Myc. N-Myc-transduced progenitor B cells were sorted
and transplanted intravenously into irradiated recipients (Figure 3a and b left). Transplanted
N-Myc-transduced progenitor B cells failed to induce tumors, even when 50,000 cells were
injected (Table 3). These data suggest that more highly differentiated cells in the
hematopoietic lineage are less susceptible to N-Myc-induced tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

Recent reports have suggested a close correlation between the self-renewing activity of
normal tissue stem cells and inactivation of Ink4a and Arf. We recently showed that loss of
Ink4a and Arf is required for the development of c-Myc-induced osteosarcoma-initiating
cells from BM stromal cells (Shimizu et al 2010). Here, we isolated progenitor B cells
derived from Ink4a/Arf deficient mice (Figure 3b right) and used them for retroviral
transduction and transplantation. Mice that received N-Myc-transduced Ink4a/Arf−/−
progenitor B cells developed pre-B ALL/LBL with a shorter latency than mice transplanted
with N-Myc-transduced WT HSCs (Table 3). As few as 1,000 Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B

cells were sufficient to induce tumors. Furthermore, tumor cells and tissues exhibited a
similar immunophenotype (B220+ CD19+ CD43+/− IgM−) and histopathology to those that
originated from WT HSCs (Figure 3c and d). In addition, we found that c-Myc also induced
pre-B ALL/LBL from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells (Supplementary Figure 3a). These
results suggest that Myc can directly transform committed progenitor B cells in the absence
of Ink4a and Arf, and that Ink4a and Arf are critical determining factors of the cell of origin.
Tumor cells derived from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells are more resistant to Ara-C
treatment and grew faster than tumor cells derived from WT HSCs

Author Manuscript

To characterize potential differences in drug sensitivity between pre-B ALL/LBL tumors
derived from N-Myc-transduced WT HSCs and Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor-B cells, tumorbearing mice were administered 4 doses of daily intraperitoneal Ara-C (Cano et al 2008),
which is a standard chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of hematopoietic tumors. Four
days after the first injection of Ara-C, the number of tumor cells in peripheral blood was
decreased in both types of pre-B ALL/LBL mice (Figure 4a). However, tumor cells derived
from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor-B cells had a significantly greater surviving population and
exhibited re-growth at a much faster rate than those from WT HSCs (Figure 4a). To confirm
this sensitivity to Ara-C in vitro, tumor cells were harvested from BM and then cultured for
several days before being treated with Ara-C for 48 h. The results of Annexin V staining
showed that tumor cells from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor-B cells had a significantly greater
population of surviving cells (Annexin V-negative cells) after Ara-C treatment than those
from WT HSCs at several different concentrations of Ara-C (Figure 4b). Moreover, tumor
cells from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor-B cells exhibited a faster growth rate than those from
WT HSCs in vitro (Figure 4c). These results suggest that tumor cells that lack Ink4a and Arf
are more refractory to Ara-C treatment and show faster growth.

Author Manuscript

Arf is a key factor in determining the cell of origin of pre-B ALL/LBL

Author Manuscript

The expression of Ink4a and Arf is normally maintained at a low level to endow HSCs with
self-renewing capacity. The polycomb protein Bmi1 suppresses the expression of both genes
through promoter methylation of the CDKN2A locus in HSCs (Park et al 2003, Iwama et al
2004). To analyze how these genes were regulated in committed progenitor B cells, N-Myctransduced HSCs and progenitor B cells from WT mice were fractionated, and the
expression of Ink4a, Arf and Bmi1 was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Ink4a
expression in N-Myc-transduced progenitor B cells was similar to that in HSCs, whereas Arf
expression was significantly higher (> 200 fold) (Figure 5a). On the other hand, Bmi1
expression in progenitor B cells was significantly lower than in HSCs. The levels of
transduced N-Myc expression were similar in both HSCs and progenitor B cells. Moreover,
Arf expression in progenitor B cells transduced with the control vector was also significantly
higher than that in control HSCs (Figure 5b). Thus N-Myc transduction did not affect Arf
expression in HSCs and progenitor B cells, indicating that Arf expression is maintained at a
high level in progenitor B cells. To clarify whether Bmi1 overexpression suppresses Arf
expression in progenitor B cells, the retroviral vector expressing Bmi1 were infected into
progenitor B cells and then mRNA level of Arf was measured by quantitative real-time RTPCR. As a result, Arf expression was significantly reduced in Bmi1-transduced cells
compared with control-transduced cells, suggesting that Arf expression in progenitor B cells

depends on Bmi1 expression (Figure 5c). Collectively, these results raised the possibility
that Arf has a key role in blocking N-Myc-induced transformation of progenitor B cells.
To determine a role of Arf in progenitor B cells, Arf−/− progenitor B cells were isolated
from Arf deficient mice and infected with the retroviral vector expressing N-Myc.
Transplantation of 10,000 or only 1,000 N-Myc-transduced Arf−/− progenitor B cells
induced pre-B ALL/LBL with similar immunophenotype (B220+ CD43+/− IgM−) to
Ink4a/Arf−/−-derived tumor cells (Figure 5d). Thus, these findings suggest that Arf plays a
predominant role in determining the cell of origin of pre-B ALL/LBL.
The Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 restores p53 and thereby effectively induces apoptosis in
tumor cells derived from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Mdm2, a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53, functions as an E3
ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate p53, which leads to p53 degradation (Wade et al 2010).
Nutlin-3 is a small molecule inhibitor that prevents Mdm2 binding to p53 (Vassilev et al
2004) and has recently been evaluated as a novel, targeted agent in leukemia therapy
(Kojima et al 2005, Gu et al 2008). Since Arf inhibits Mdm2 binding to p53, we
hypothesized that Nutlin-3 might substitute for Arf and reactivate p53 in tumor cells derived
from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells. Nutlin-3 treatment induced extensive apoptosis in
cultured Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cell-derived tumor cells (Figure 6a, left). In fact, all 3
tumor cell clones were effectively killed by Nutlin-3 treatment in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 6a, right). The sequence of the p53 gene was confirmed as wild-type in all 3
clones. In contrast, Nutlin-3 was relatively ineffective against tumor cells derived from WT
HSCs and WT bulk BM cells, which contained mutations in the p53 in the DNA-binding
region (Supplementary Figure 4a and b). Following Nutlin-3 treatment, p53 and the
apoptosis indicator cleaved caspase-3 were increased in tumor cells derived from Ink4a/
Arf−/− cells (Figure 6b). The p53 targets p21 and Mdm2 were also increased by Nutlin-3
treatment. Furthermore, Ink4a/Arf−/−-derived tumor cells expressing p53 shRNA showed
significant reduction of Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis compared with those cells expressing
control luciferase shRNA, confirming that the Nulin-3-induced apoptosis is p53-dependent
(Figure 6c).

Author Manuscript

We next investigated the effect of co-treatment with Ara-C and Nutlin-3 on tumor cells from
Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells. For this analysis, we examined tumor cells of clone 1, as
they were less sensitive to 2.5 μM Nutlin-3 compared to the other clones (Figure 6a right).
Although treatment with Ara-C (0.25 μg/ml) or Nutlin-3 (2.5 μM) alone did not efficiently
induce apoptosis (24.7% and 39.5%, respectively), combination treatment with Ara-C and
Nutlin-3 had a synergistic effect on enhancing apoptosis (75.5%) in tumor cells from
Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells (Figure 6d left). Nutlin-3 effectively killed tumor cells when
combined with different concentrations of Ara-C (Figure 6d right). Collectively, these data
suggest that Nutlin-3 may be effective in eradicating tumor cells lacking Ink4a and Arf.

Nutlin-3 effectively induces apoptosis in human B-ALL cell lines lacking expression of
Ink4a and Arf

Author Manuscript

We attempted to apply our finding that lack of Ink4 and Arf expressions and p53 status can
affect chemotherapeutic efficacy to human B-ALL cells. Six human B-ALL cell lines
including PALL-2, NAGL-1, NALM-6, HAL-01 (these 4 lines have wild-type p53),
BALL-1 and Tanoue (both 2 lines have mutated p53: D281G and M246T, respectively)
were treated with Nutlin-3 or Ara-C for 48 h. Nutlin-3 treatment significantly induced
apoptosis in cell lines with wild-type p53 but not in cell lines with mutated p53 (Figure 7a).
Furthermore, real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that the cell lines with WT p53 did not
express Ink4a and Arf genes whereas the cell lines with mutated p53 express Ink4a and/or
Arf (Figure 7b). In terms of Ara-C sensitivity, p53 status was not a critical determination
factor. Because, although BALL-1 cells having mutated p53 were more sensitive to Ara-C
treatment than cell lines with wild-type p53, Tanoue cells having mutated p53 were even
less sensitive to Ara-C (Supplementary Figure 4c). Collectively, these results suggest that
Nutlin-3 effectively induces apoptosis in human B-ALL cell lines with wild-type p53 and
lacking expression of Ink4a and Arf, which is a similar result to mouse pre-B ALL/LBL
cells.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this study, we demonstrated that N-Myc rapidly induced pre-B ALL/LBL originated from
HSCs, whereas it could not induce any tumor directly from committed progenitor B cells
due to limiting factors Ink4a and Arf. Furthermore, tumor cells derived from distinct cells of
origin showed different drug sensitivities to Ara-C and Nutlin-3, which provides a novel
insight into preventive therapy and different therapeutic approaches depending on genetic
background of tumor cells (Figure 7c). In our mouse model, there is no significant
difference between two types of Myc oncogenes, N-Myc and c-Myc, in respect to
tumorigenic activities and chemotherapeutic sensitivities of the induced tumors (Figure 4b,
6a and Supplementary Figure 3b and c). Overexpression of these Myc genes has been
reported in a number of B-ALL patients, suggesting a pathophysiological relevance between
Myc and human B-ALL (Cardone et al 2005).

Author Manuscript

Tumor-initiating cells in human B-ALL that have the potential to self-renew and generate
secondary tumors reportedly express normal HSC markers, i.e., CD34+, CD38−, and/or B
cell markers, i.e., CD10+, CD19+ (Cobaleda et al 2000, Cox et al 2004, Castor et al 2005,
Hotfilder et al 2005, Hong et al 2008, le Viseur et al 2008). In the current syngenic mouse
model, tumor-initiating cells capable of generating secondary tumors were identified in the
B cell marker-positive cell population, not the HSC marker-positive cell population, which
corroborates the fact that there are tumor-initiating cells that are positive for B cell markers
in human B-ALL. Interestingly, the tumor-initiating cells that develop primary tumors were
part of the HSC marker-positive cell population. This difference in the tumor initiating cells
between primary and secondary tumors indicates that HSCs that express Myc can essentially
disappear, developing into committed progenitor B cells during transformation. Previous
reports have suggested that the enhanced expression of Myc results in the migration of HSCs
from the BM niche, thereby promoting the commitment to progenitor cells (Wilson et al

2004). The expansion and transformation of Myc-transduced cells is believed to occur at the
stage of progenitor B cell. Recently, it was reported that c-Myc is involved in the regulation
of pro-B expansion as a downstream effector in the MAPK signaling pathway (Yasuda et al
2008), which suggests that progenitor B cells are the most suitable candidate for Mycinduced expansion. Our findings raise the possibility that Myc-transduced HSCs initially
give rise to multi-hematopoietic lineages, and then progenitor B cells gain a Myc-induced
proliferative advantage and become dominant. Ultimately, these expanding progenitor B
cells acquire additional mutations, e.g., p53 mutations, and become fully transformed.

Author Manuscript

The cell of origin of B-ALL has long been debated and is assumed to be stem cell or
immature progenitor cell (Cobaleda and Sanchez-Garcia 2009). We demonstrated that HSCs
from the BM of adult mice are the primary origin/target in pre-B ALL/LBL. HSCs express
functional Bmi1, which suppresses the expression of Ink4a and Arf and enables the cells to
maintain their self-renewing capacity. Bmi1 has been reported to suppress Arf-dependent
apoptosis induced by Myc to enhance lymphomagenesis (Jacobs et al 1999). It is possible
that HSCs are more potent to receive N-Myc overexpression without inducing apoptosis. On
the other hand, no tumors were induced directly from WT committed progenitor B cells.
Given that Arf is expressed in progenitor B cells much higher than Ink4a, and that N-Myc
was able to induce tumor derived from Arf−/− progenitor B cells, Arf represents a
predominant factor in the determination of the cell of origin of Myc-induced pre-B ALL/
LBL, similar to its role in the mouse model of BCR-ABL-induced B-ALL (Wang et al
2008). It should be noted that tumor cells derived from WT cells carried mutations in p53,
indicating that inactivation of the Arf-p53 pathway is critical for B lymphoid tumorigenesis,
consistent with previous results (Eischen et al 1999).

Following Ara-C treatment in vitro and in vivo, tumor cells derived from Ink4a/Arf−/−
progenitor B cells were more refractory to apoptosis and showed faster re-growth compared
to those derived from WT HSCs. Previous reports suggest that Ink4a/Arf−/− lymphoma cells
display reduced p53 activity and thereby escape from apoptosis and/or senescence programs
induced by p53 and Ink4a (Schmitt et al 1999, Schmitt et al 2002). Fast growth of Ink4a/
Arf−/− tumor cells may arise from a fact that Arf-null pre-B cells show canceling Arf-p53
checkpoint and thus promote Myc-induced proliferation (Eischen et al 1999). Although
tumors that originated from WT HSCs carried mutated p53, these cells expressed high levels
of Ink4a and Arf (Supplementary Figure 4d). Ink4a and Arf play crucial roles in the
induction of apoptosis and Arf can also induce apoptosis independently of p53
(Ausserlechner et al 2001, Tsuji et al 2002). The heightened sensitivity of tumor cells from
WT HSCs to Ara-C treatment compared to those from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells may
reflect a p53-independent mechanism of apoptosis by Ink4a and Arf.
The CDKN2A locus is deleted or inactivated in nearly half of all cases of B-ALL, especially
Ph+ B-ALL and recurrent types of B-ALL (Mullighan et al 2008a, Mullighan et al 2008b).
To date, there has not been a good mouse model for understanding and developing
treatments for these types of malignant ALL. The mouse model of pre-B ALL/LBL derived
from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells developed in the current study could be such a suitable
model. In testing novel therapeutic approaches with this model, we used Nutlin-3 to inhibit
p53-Mdm2 binding because all of the tumor clones derived from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B

cells had wild-type p53, and p53 gene mutations are relatively infrequent in cases of CMLlymphoid blast crisis, in which Arf loss predominates (Calabretta and Perrotti 2004). We
demonstrated that Nutlin-3 treatment reactivated p53 and drastically induced apoptosis in
tumor cells derived from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor B cells. Recently, it was reported that
Nutlin-3 is effective against human B-ALL cells with wild-type p53 (Gu et al 2008). We
found that Nutlin-3 treatment effectively induced apoptosis in human B-ALL cell lines with
wild-type p53 and lacking Ink4a and Arf expression, and thereby the concept we obtained
from our established pre-B ALL/LBL mouse model can be applied to human B-ALL. We
further tested combination treatment with Ara-C and Nutlin-3 in consideration of the clinical
setting (Kojima et al 2006). In this case, relatively low dose of Nutlin-3 acted synergistically
to enhance apoptosis induced by Ara-C in tumor cells derived from Ink4a/Arf−/− progenitor
B cells. These results suggest that the upregulation of p53 by Nutlin-3 enhances Ara-Cinduced apoptosis. If a tumor is classified as pre B-ALL according to histopathology and
immunophenotype, additional analysis to determine genetic background, such as p53
mutation or Ink4a/Arf inactivation, could inform the most appropriate therapeutic strategy
for an individual patient.

Models of Human Cancers Consortium (NCI-Frederick). Arf−/− mice were described
previously (Kamijo et al 1997) and kindly provided by C.J. Sherr (St. Jude Children’s
Hospital). Animals were cared for in accordance with the guidelines of the Keio University
School of Medicine.
Human cell lines
Two human B-ALL cell lines PALL-2 and NAGL-1 were obtained from HSRRB (Osaka,
Japan). The other human B-ALL cell lines NALM-6, HAL-01, BALL-1 and Tanoue were
obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba Japan). NAGL-1 was maintained in IMDM
(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) supplemented with 20% FCS and the other cell lines were
maintained in RPMI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C in 5%
CO2 and 100% humidity.
Retroviral vectors, transduction and bone marrow transplant assay

Author Manuscript

Mouse N-Myc and ΔMBII cDNAs were cloned into the retroviral vector pMXs-IG. Mouse
Bmi1 cDNA was cloned into pMXs-IRES-DsRed. The empty vector was used as a control.
The pMX-based vectors were transfected into Plat-E packaging cells (Morita et al 2000)
using Fugene HD (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and then the cells were allowed to incubate
overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection. Viral
supernatants were filtered using a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filter (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan)
after 48 h of incubation. Procedures of retroviral infection and bone marrow transplant assay
are described in Supplementary Methods.

Author Manuscript

BM-MNCs from tumor-bearing mice were stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated
anti-B220, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CD43, CD19 (all from Biolegend, San Diego,
CA), and IgM antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Samples were analyzed using a
FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Cell sorting is described in
Supplementary Methods.
Ara-C and Nutlin-3 treatment

Author Manuscript

Tumor-bearing mice were treated intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg of cytosine arabinoside
(Ara-C, Sigma) for 4 consecutive days. Peripheral blood (PB) was lysed with red blood cell
lysis buffer and then counted. For the apoptosis assay, cells were incubated in the presence
or absence of Ara-C and/or Nutlin-3 (Kojima et al 2005) for 48 h. Assays for detection of
apoptosis and BrdU incorporation are described in Supplementary Methods.
Immunoblot analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed and denatured as previously described (Sugihara et al 2006). Samples were
separated by SDS-PAGE and then proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in
blocking buffer consisting of 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, followed by
an appropriate dilution of anti-p53 (FL-393), anti-Mdm2 (SMP14), anti-p21 (C-19), (all
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA) or anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) primary antibody overnight at 4 °C.
Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(GE Healthcare) for 45 min at room temperature. Peroxidase activity was detected by
Western lightning chemiluminescence reagents (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Differences between two groups were compared using the two-tailed unpaired Student’s ttest. P values in frequency of tumor-initiating cells based on limiting dilution analysis were
calculated with ELDA (Hu and Smyth 2009). P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
