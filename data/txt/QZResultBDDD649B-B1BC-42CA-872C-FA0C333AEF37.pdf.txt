Abstract
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is displayed by approximately 15% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Defective DNA
mismatch repair generates mutations at repetitive DNA sequences such as those located in the double strand
break (DSB) repair gene MRE11. We assessed the mutational status of MRE11 in a panel of 17 CRC cell lines and 46
primary tumors and found a strong correlation with MSI status in both cell lines and tumors. Therefore, we
hypothesized that deficiency in MRE11 may sensitize CRC cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1)
inhibition based on the concept of synthetic lethality. We further assessed the activity of the PARP-1 inhibitor,
ABT-888, in CRC cell lines and observed preferential cytotoxicity in those MSI cell lines harboring mutations in
MRE11 compared with both wild-type cell lines and microsatellite stable (MSS) cell lines. A significant correlation
between MRE11 expression levels and cytotoxicity to ABT-888 at 10 mM was observed (R2 ¼ 0.915, P < 0.001). Using
two experimental approaches, including short hairpin RNA knocking down MRE11 in the wild-type and MSS cell
line SW-480 and a second cell line model transfected with mutant MRE11, we experimentally tried to confirm the
role of MRE11 in conferring sensitivity to PARP-1 inhibition. Both models led to changes in proliferation in
response to ABT-888 at different concentrations, and a drug–response effect was not observed, suggesting a
possible contribution of additional genes. We conclude that MSI colorectal tumors deficient in DSB repair
secondary to mutation in MRE11 show a higher sensitivity to PARP-1 inhibition. Further clinical investigation of
PARP-1 inhibitors is warranted in MSI CRCs. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2632–42. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Tumors displaying microsatellite instability (MSI) either
due to germline or epigenetic inactivation of one of the
mismatch repair (MMR) genes account for approximately
10% to 15% of colorectal cancers (CRC; refs 1 and 2). Sporadic
MSI tumors have recognizable clinicopathologic features such
as right-sided location, older age of diagnosis, lower pathologic stage, and better prognosis (3–5). Genetic instability in
this subgroup primarily reflects variation in microsatellite

tracts due to a defective functioning of the surveillance
mechanism performed by the MMR system. This instability
is further reflected by more than 30 genes known to have
mutations in microsatellite tract repeats, including DNA
repair proteins involved in double strand break (DSB) repair
through the homologous recombination pathway, such as
MRE11 and RAD50 (6). In particular, a microsatellite tract
of 11(T) located at intron 4 of MRE11 is mutated in approximately 80% of MSI tumors and leads to aberrant splicing and a
truncated protein (7). The multiprotein complex integrated by
MRE11-RAD50-NBS (MRN complex) is the primary sensor of
DSB and recruits other signaling proteins at DSB sites (8).
These microsatellite mutations constitute a specific genetic
background that can be exploited as a potential drug target
and predictor of sensitivity to specific therapies focused on
DNA damage pathways. In fact, mutations in MRE11 have
been shown to sensitize cells to agents causing replication fork
stress as a result of a lack of 30 to 50 exonuclease activity,
absence of formation of MRE11 foci, and ATM autophosphorylation (9).
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) cooperates with
DNA ligases to repair single strand breaks whenever the ends
need processing (10). Therefore, inhibitors of PARP-1 increase
the levels of persisting single strand breaks that lead to
DNA DSB upon replication (11). DSBs are one of the most
important threats to genomic integrity and trigger repair

MRE11 and PARP-1 Inhibition in MSI Colorectal Cancer

proteins involved in the nonhomologous end joining and
homologous recombination pathways. Experimental evidence
shows a direct interaction between PARP-1 and MRE11
reflected by the fact that PARP-1 is apparently required for
rapid accumulation of MRE11 at DSB sites (12). Therefore,
tumor cells harboring mutations of genes involved in homologous recombination such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and MRE11 are
particularly vulnerable to DNA damage. Our aim in this study
was to assess the activity of the PARP-1 inhibitor ABT-888 in
CRC cell lines harboring a mutation in the homologous
recombination gene MRE11 that frequently accompanies
MMR deficiency.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and primary tumor samples
A total of 17 CRC cell lines were selected for experiments
based on microsatellite status obtained from the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute Cancer Genome Project (13) as detailed
in Supplementary Table S1. Cell lines were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. MSI status was also confirmed independently in cell lines, as well as the presence of
mutations in the principal oncogenes for CRC. Cells were
grown in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. SW480/SN3 and
its derivative SM1.3 expressing a construct for D5–7MRE11 were
generously provided by Dr. Mark Meuth (Institute for Cancer
Studies, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) and has been
reported previously (9). These cell lines were grown in DMEM
medium. In addition, 46 CRC samples from the Molecular
Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer (MECC; ref. 14) study were
assessed for the frequency mutation of MRE11 poly(T)11 in
primary colon tumors (Supplementary Table S2).
Analysis of MRE11 poly(T)11 and RAD50 poly(A)9 in cell
lines and primary tumors
Analyses for the length of the MRE11 poly(T)11 and RAD50
poly(A)9 were performed on genomic DNA extracted from cell
lines and CRC samples microdissected from paraffin
embedded tissue blocks. Forward and reverse primers for
MRE11 and RAD50 were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein.
PCRs were performed using GeneAmp Fast PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) in separate reactions. The PCR fragments were detected by capillary electrophoresis on ABI370 at
the University of Michigan Sequencing Core. The electropherograms were analyzed using GeneMarker v1.51 software (SoftGenetics). Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available
upon request.
Expression of MRE11 wild-type and mutant transcripts
and PARP-1
Total RNA from 10 cell lines was extracted using the TRIzol
protocol according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Adequate quantities of high-quality total RNA were
determined by Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). cDNA was synthesized using High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit from 200 ng of RNA. All samples
were tested in triplicate. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-

www.aacrjournals.org

PCR) was carried out using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900
HT Sequence Detection System. Two sets of primers were
designed to assess the independent expression levels of the
MRE11 wild type and the mutant transcript, 1 set for PARP-1
and 1 for GAPDH that was used as an endogenous control.
Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon
request. The relative expression of the wild type and mutant
transcript of MRE11 and PARP1 was calculated by DCt normalization to the expression of GAPDH.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were cultured on coverslips, fixed, and processed as
previously described (15). For each cell line, Rad51 and gH2AX
foci were quantified following fixation of cells 24 hours after
being seeded (t ¼ 0) and 18 hours after irradiation (7.5 Gy; t ¼
18). Samples were imaged with an Olympus FV500 confocal
microscope (Olympus America) with a 60 objective. For
quantification of Rad51 and gH2AX foci, at least 100 cells
were visually scored for each condition by 2 independent
observers. Cells with 5 foci were scored as positive and the
percentage of positivity was compared at baseline and 18
hours following irradiation for 3 cell lines (SW620, HCT15, and
SW48).
Irradiation
Cells were irradiated using a Philips RT250 (Kimtron Medical) at a dose rate of 2 Gy/min in the University of Michigan
Comprehensive Cancer Center Experimental Irradiation Core.
Statistical analysis of association between expression
and mutational status of MRE11
Comparisons of expression levels between cell lines
grouped by MRE11 mutational status across 3 categories were
performed using the rank-based, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test
followed by post hoc Dunn's test for pairwise differences
among groups (MRE11 homozygous vs. heterozygous
mutants, MRE11 homozygous mutants vs. wild type, MRE11
heterozygous mutants vs. wild-type) using SAS version 9.1.
Nonparametric methods were used to protect against violation of normality assumption given the limited sample size.
Analysis of gene expression data of tumor samples
RNA isolation and microarray procedures were used.
Primary tumors were obtained at the time of surgical resection, after which they were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at
80 C, embedded in optimum cutting temperature freezing
media (Miles Scientific), cryotome sectioned, stained with
hematoxilin and eosin, and evaluated by a surgical pathologist.
Areas with >70% tumor cellularity were identified for RNA
isolation. Selected sections of tumor samples were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen), and total cellular RNA was
purified according to the instructions of the manufacturer,
with additional purification using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and samples were included only if the 18S and 28S
bands were discrete and approximately equal. Expression
levels were measured in 2 batches using Affymetrix U133A

and U133A Plus 2.0 arrays. Preparation of target cRNA, hybridization, and scanning were performed according to the
protocols of the manufacturer.
Statistical analysis of microarray data
Expression analyses were carried out in the R-software
using the package Bioconductor (16). Expression data in
both batches were first subjected to quality assessment by
creating the density plot of the log-intensity and RNA
degradation plot corresponding to each sample. For all
331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were
normalized using the quantile normalization procedure
implemented in robust multiarray analysis (17, 18) and
the normalized data were log2 transformed. Sample-specific
median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were
additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe
sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low
variability across samples. Expression values were required
to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range
across the samples on log2 scale was required to be at least
0.5. After preprocessing and quality assessment, the 2
batches were aligned. Probes of the U133A array present
in the U133A Plus 2.0 were selected and quantile normalized
to mimic the distribution of the U133A array. Five samples
had been hybridized in both arrays and served to verify that
the correlation of the expression was adequate for the
majority of the probes. A total of 331 samples and 419,473
probe sets were subjected to further analysis. Two-class
comparison of MSI versus MSS tumors was carried out by
2-sample t-test to yield a list of differentially expressed probe
sets, discriminating between the 2 biologic states of interest
under consideration. We had information on MSI status
available from 300 patients whose characteristics are
detailed in Supplementary Table S3. The issue of multiple
testing was addressed by using adjusted P values after
controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini
and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P values; ref. 19). We
also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with
our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in
R (20).
Gene expression data sources, selection of probes from
gene expression data sets submitted to the Connectivity
Map Build 02 and generation of compound lists
Bioinformatic approaches to identify the level of enrichment between gene expression profiles characterizing MSI
tumors and gene changes induced in vitro by the PARP-1
inhibitor phenanthridinone and others were assessed using
the Connectivity Map (21). We used 5 different data sets
characterizing MSI-H tumors. Four of them were previously published and retrieved directly from their original
publications (22–25). Criteria followed for selection of
probe sets and detailed lists have been published previously (26). The fifth data set was generated from a total
of 300 colorectal fresh frozen tumors collected from the
MECC study and analyzed in 2 batches. The first batch was
hybridized to the Affymetrix U133A chip and the second

2634

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

one to U133A Plus 2.0 (Supplementary Table S3). The final
list of probe sets defining gene expression of MSI-H compared with MSS tumors was selected based on the strength
of multiplicity adjusted P values (cutoff, P < 0.001) and ratio
of mean expression values across the 2 groups (cutoff foldchange >1.3 and <0.7). It contained 442 upregulated and
480 downregulated probe sets as detailed in Supplementary
Tables S4 and S5.
Cytotoxicity experiments, dose–response data, and
IC50 calculations of ABT-888 in cell line models
ABT-888 (A-861695, Abbott Laboratories) was obtained
from Axxora. Stock concentrations of 1 mM were maintained in DMSO and were dissolved in supplemented medium to obtain 6 serial dilutions (1 nM to 50 mM). Cytotoxicity
experiments were performed in 4 homozygous MRE11
mutant, 1 heterozygous, and 3 wild-type cell lines. One
thousand cells were seeded in triplicate per well and after
24 hours medium was replaced with medium containing 6
different concentrations of ABT-888. In control wells, cells
were fed with standard medium. After 6 days of treatment
cell viability was estimated using WST-1. Cell viability was
estimated on the basis of their ability to metabolize the
tretazolium salt WST-1 to formazan by mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Quantification of absorbances was analyzed
using a Spectramax 190 (Molecular Devices Corporation).
The percentage of surviving cells at each concentration
relative to the nontreated group was calculated. The IC50
was then estimated by fitting a sigmoid shaped dose–
response curve. Differences in drug sensitivity comparing
the mean IC50 of 3 independent experiments for every cell
line and cell proliferation data at a certain drug concentration (10 mM) between cell lines classified by MRE11 polyT
(11) mutational status were determined using KruskalWallis ANOVA as described previously. In addition, correlation between the levels of expression of the mutant transcript of MRE11 poly(T)11 and the percentage of growth
inhibition induced by ABT-888 at 10 mM was examined by
Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation test. P < 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance. These calculations were performed using SAS version 9.1.
Cell cycle analysis
For cell cycle analysis, cells were washed in cold PBS, fixed
in 70% ethanol, washed, resuspended in 25 mg/mL Propidium iodine (PI) with 100 mg/mL RNase A (BD Pharmigen),
and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C. Fluorescence was
measured on a BD Biosciences FACSCaliburs flow cytometer
within 1 hour. Data were analyzed using the MODFIT 2.0
program (Verity Software House).
Stable knockdown of MRE11 in SW-480 cells
Several lentiviral-based plasmids containing a short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) to human MRE11 were purchased from
Open Biosystems. Nonsilencing (mock) shRNAs were used
as negative controls. The sequence of the MRE11-specific 22mer shRNA with highest efficacy and reported here was

MRE11 and PARP-1 Inhibition in MSI Colorectal Cancer

AGGCCATGAACATGAGTGTAAA. Experimental procedures
for shRNA transfection were done according to the Open
Biosystems technical manual. Stable clones were generated
by transfecting SW480 cells in 6-well dishes with 2 mg of each
of the shRNA plasmids using FugeneHD (Roche) according to
the manufacturer's recommendations. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, the cells were placed under selection with 2.0 mg/
mL puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich), splitting them when the cells
reached confluency. Multiple clones from the same transfection were pooled and grown under puromycin selection.
Successful knockdown of specific gene products was confirmed by qRT-PCR as described earlier.

Results
Microsatellite unstable colorectal cancer cell lines are
associated with mutations in MRE11 poly(T)11
Mutations in coding microsatellite tracts of MRE11 and
RAD50 were assessed in a panel of 17 CRC cell lines. None of
the MSS cell lines was mutated in MRE11 or RAD50. All MSIhigh (MSI-H) cell lines harbored a mutation in the polyT(11)
tract located in the intron 4 of MRE11. Three had monoallelic
and 5 had biallelic mutations. Only 3 cell lines harbored
mutations in an exonic polyA(9) repeat of RAD50 (Table 1;
Supplementary Table S1), and all of them were MSI. Therefore,
we decided to focus our attention on MRE11. To confirm the
frequency of the MRE11-intron 4 mutation, we genotyped 46
tumors from the MECC study (Supplementary Table S2).
Eighteen out of 22 (82%) of MSI tumors harbored a mutation
in MRE11 compared with 0% of MSS tumors (P < 0.001).
Among the 22 MSI tumors with MRE11 mutations, 36% of
tumors had biallelic mutations.
Mutations of MRE11 are not associated with an increase
of PARP-1 expression
Because the Intron 4-MRE11 mutation generates a change
in splicing that leads to skipping of exon 5, we decided to
assess the expression of MRE11 in 10 CRC cell lines. Two sets
of primers for the mutant and the wild-type transcripts of
MRE11 were designed (Fig. 1A). Those cell lines harboring
biallelic mutations in MRE11 showed a significant decrease
in the levels of the wild-type transcript of MRE11 and an

increase in the mutant transcript compared to wild-type
cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 1B and C). In contrast, cell lines with
monoallelic mutations showed intermediate expression
levels of the mutant transcript compared with wild-type
cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 1C). In addition, we assessed the basal
levels of PARP-1 expression and no differences were
observed between MRE11 mutant and wild-type cell lines
(Fig. 1D).
MSI-H tumors present with changes in gene expression
related to the homologous recombination pathway
Once we observed that deficiency in MRE11 exists among
MSI tumors, our interest was focused on assessing if the
homologous recombination pathway showed evidence of
deregulation in MSI tumors. Therefore, we examined the
expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG
pathway hsa03440 using data from a total of 300 CRCs from
the MECC study (Supplementary Table S3). As shown in Fig.
2A and Supplementary Table S6, a total of 14 of 30 genes were
significantly differentially expressed in MSI-H compared with
MSS tumors (BH-adjusted P < 0.005; ref. 19). MRE11 and
RAD50 probe sets showed a lower expression in MSI-H tumors
and simultaneously other probe sets such as PARP-1 were
significantly upregulated, probably due to the deficiency in the
MRN complex proteins (Fig. 2B). These data provide evidence
of significant differential expression of the homologous
recombination pathway in MSI tumors.
Mutations of MRE11 induce higher levels of unrepaired
DNA damage and attenuate the formation of Rad51 foci
after irradiation
To determine the effect of MRE11 mutation on homologous
recombination repair, we measured Rad51 focus formation at
baseline and in response to radiation-induced DNA damage.
We found that Rad51 focus formation following irradiation in
the wild-type and monoallelic MRE11 mutant cell lines was
significantly increased from baseline. However, the cell line
harboring a biallelic mutation did not exhibit Rad51 mobilization upon irradiation. This observation highlights the impairment of DSB repair by the homologous recombination
pathway in cell lines deficient in MRE11 (Fig. 3). Furthermore,
we investigated the degree of unrepaired DNA damage in cell
lines with different MRE11 mutational statuses by quantifying
gH2AX with immunofluorescence (data not shown). In all 3
cell lines, irradiation induced an increase in the levels of
unrepaired DNA damage, as expected. Under baseline conditions, the cell line SW-48 harboring biallelic mutations in
MRE11 presented with more cells positive for gH2AX foci as
compared with the wild-type cell line SW-620 and the monoallelic mutant HCT-15, suggesting that MRE11 mutation
results in accumulation of DNA damage in otherwise unperturbed cells.
A gene expression profile of MSI-H tumors is
anticorrelated with changes induced by the PARP-1
inhibitor phenathridinone
Based on this deficiency in DSB repair exhibited by MSI
tumors, we hypothesized that PARP-1 inhibitors might have a

(0.60; Table 2) were very similar across signatures. 1,5Isoquinolinediol was correlated in only one of the data sets.
However, based on previous in vitro studies, this compound is
the least specific in terms of PARP inhibition of the 3 compounds studied.
Low levels of MRE11 wild-type transcripts increase the
sensitivity to the PARP-1 inhibitor ABT-888 in MSI-H
cell lines
We selected ABT-888 to assess the effects of a novel PARP-1
inhibitor in a CRC model deficient in MRE11. We used 3 wildtype, 1 monoallelic, and 4 biallelic mutants of MRE11 cell lines
for these experiments. Because the monoallelic mutant cell
line has intermediate expression levels of the MRE11 mutant
transcript but closer to wild-type cells, we decided to group it
along with them for IC50 and cytotoxicity at 10 mM comparisons. A significant difference in cytotoxicity was found at
10 mM concentration between biallelic mutants and wild-type
plus monoallelic mutants (44.5% vs. 80.65%, P ¼ 0.028; Fig. 4A)
and a 2.5-fold difference in IC50 when compared between

www.aacrjournals.org

these 2 groups (8.9 vs. 22.23 mM, P ¼ 0.028; Fig. 4B). Then we
studied the correlation between levels of expression of the
mutant transcript of MRE11 and cytotoxicity to ABT-888 at a
concentration of 10 mM showing a significant association
between both (R ¼ 0.9048, P ¼ 0.0046; Fig. 4C). Cell cycle
changes revealed an arrest in G1 and a decrease in S-phase
after treatment with ABT-888 in MRE11 biallelic mutants
(Fig. 4D), consistent with expectation given the mechanism
of PARP inhibitors.
Finally, we conducted experiments using 2 different
approaches to diminish the expression of MRE11. First, shRNA
was used to knock down the expression of MRE11 in a
wild-type MRE11 and MSS cell line to further assess its role
as a mediator of the effect of PARP-1 inhibition. As depicted
in Fig. 5A, we were able to achieve a significant, but incomplete, knockdown of MRE11 gene expression in the SW-480 cell
line. We observed differences in proliferation between mock
shRNA and MRE11 shRNA stable transfectants when 50 mM
of ABT-888 was used, pointing toward a potential role of
MRE11 as responsible for the drug effects (Fig. 5B). Therefore,

a second validation experiment using the cell line SW480/SN3
and its derivative SM1.3 was performed. SM1.3 was originally
transfected with an expression construct for D5–7MRE11
lacking exons 5 to 7 that was originally cloned from the
CRC cell line HCT-116. Experiments using this cell line were
designed to confirm the role of MRE11 mutations in conferring
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. We assessed the expression of
the wild-type transcript of MRE11 in the parental SW-480/SN3
and in SM1.3 observing that the derivative cell line SM1.3
expressed less than 20% of the parent line's MRE11 transcript
levels, supporting its utility as an appropriate model (Fig. 5A).
Cytotoxicity assays comparing ABT-888 in these
2 cell lines showed a higher response by SM1.3 to PARP
inhibition at 10 mM, consistent with the trends of the results
obtained with the shRNA approach. However, SM1.3 did not
show a differential response at 50 mM, suggesting either a
threshold effect or an imperfect dose–response relationship
when compared with the previous shRNA knockdown
approach (Fig. 5C).

Discussion

Figure 3. Rad51 foci were analyzed under baseline conditions (B, t ¼ 0)
and 18 hours after irradiation (IR, t ¼ 18). Percentages of foci-positive cells
at each time point are presented. Error bars represent standard errors of
the mean for 2 independent observations. Asterisks designate statistically
significant differences in percent positivity at baseline versus 18 hours
postirradiation (P < 0.05). Representative images are presented for both
markers and time points.

Genetic instability in MSI tumors is secondary to the
presence of a deficiency in the MMR system that introduces
a myriad of mutations in downstream genes (27). One of these
gene targets is MRE11, a gene that is implicated in homologous recombination. MRE11 forms a multiprotein complex
with RAD50 and NBS1 that signals double strand DNA breaks
and then recruits other proteins that initiate DNA repairing.

NOTE. Enrichment and connectivity scores for every data set are presented. These scores are intended to reflect the correlation between
gene expression changes induced in cell line models after treatment with first-generation PARP-1 inhibitor and those gene expression
profiles characterizing MSI-H tumors coming from different data sets. The enrichment score indicates the strength of this correlation and
the connectivity score is relative to the rest of drugs tested in the Connectivity Map. The absolute value of both ranges from þ1 to 1 and
refers to the level of correlation or anticorrelation with the original signature of interest. Phenanthridinone, NU-1025, and 1,5Isoquinolinediol are first-generation PARP inhibitors, with phenanthridinone being the compound with the most consistent results.

We have observed frequent mutations in an specific poly(T)11
tract located in the intron 4 of MRE11 in MSI colorectal
tumors that is consistent with previous reports (28, 29), thus
confirming that MSI is strongly associated with this MRE11
mutation.
At the present time, deficiency in homologous recombination has been therapeutically exploited in those tumors exhibiting mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (30). This novel
therapeutic approach is based on the fact that simultaneous

www.aacrjournals.org

deficiency in 2 genes may introduce lethality in a biologic
system that otherwise would be tolerant to the loss of one of
them (31). Although the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is more
predominant in homologous recombination than MRE11, our
hypothesis is that other components of this pathway may also
predict an increase in the sensitivity to PARP-1 inhibitors. In
terms of the biology of DSB repair, we have shown that cell
lines harboring biallelic mutations in MRE11 did not effectively promote homologous recombination expressed by the

mobilization of Rad51. Moreover, biallelic mutant cell lines
presented with higher levels of unrepaired DNA damage in
basal conditions. Consistent with our hypothesis, we then
demonstrated that those CRC cell lines displaying MSI and
harboring biallelic mutations in MRE11 have greater sensitivity
to PARP-1 inhibition. However, the effect of PARP-1 inhibition
is abrogated when 1 wild-type allele of MRE11 is retained.
This point has been illustrated in our data by the fact that a
heterozygous cell line had similar sensitivity to PARP-1 inhibition to those with both alleles intact. A similar effect has been

2640

reported in the preclinical testing of these compounds in
BRCA-1 and -2 deficient models. Therefore, we suggest that
those patients with MSI tumors harboring biallelic mutations
in MRE11 may represent a target population for the use of
PARP-1 inhibitors in patients with MSI CRCs. We have shown
that tumors with bialleic mutations represent approximately
36% of the total of MRE11 mutants. Finally, we tested several
shRNA constructs in 2 different MSS CRC cell lines, SW-480
and HT-29, to functionally validate the contribution of
MRE11 to PARP-1 sensitivity. We initially observed that those

MRE11 and PARP-1 Inhibition in MSI Colorectal Cancer

transfections with highest efficacy knocking-down the expression of MRE11 induced lethality in the cells. The validation
experiments were first performed in a SW-480 transfected with
a shRNA that achieved a level of downregulation of only 25%.
Despite this limited suppression, we observed a higher sensitivity to PARP-1 inhibitors at 50 mM of ABT-888 following this
level of decreased MRE11 expression. In addition, we performed a second set of validation studies using a cell line model
transfected with a transcript that contains a mutation in
MRE11 lacking exons 5 to 7 and leads to dramatically lower
levels of the wild-type MRE11 at 80% of the baseline compared
with the parental cell line. Again we observed that PARP
inhibition exerted a higher effect on the derivative cell line
SM1.3 at a lower concentration of the drug of 10 mM but not at
50 mM. Therefore, these data are not entirely consistent with
dose–response inhibition across all concentrations, and suggest that either inhibitory thresholds might not be perfectly
modeled by our transfection system, or that other genetic
variation may contribute to PARP sensitivity. In fact, we have
been able to identify by using gene expression profiling other
candidate genes that are involved in the homologous recombination pathway and significantly deregulated in MSI-H
tumors.
To our knowledge, this is the first communication on the
activity of PARP-1 inhibitor in a solid tumor harboring a
deficiency in a DNA repair pathway other than BRCA1 and
BRCA2, thus suggesting broader applications of this therapeutic strategy. Therefore, our study also provides precli-

nical rationale for an ongoing phase II clinical trial exploring
the activity of a different PARP-1 inhibitor in colorectal
tumors stratified by MSI status (NCT00912743). In addition,
we suggest that combinations of other therapies inducing
DSB such as radiation or irinotecan may enhance the effects
of PARP-1 inhibitors in MSI CRCs and are warranted in the
future.
