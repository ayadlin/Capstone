Guideline-Recommended Treatment

BACKGROUND: Many patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma do not receive adjuvant chemotherapy despite
the proven survival advantage it offers. To enhance the provision of optimal cancer care, patient characteristics associated with not receiving guideline-adherent treatment must be identified among patients with operable, stage III colon adenocarcinoma. METHODS: This was a population-based, retrospective study of all patients who underwent
surgery for stage III colon adenocarcinoma diagnosed from 2002 through 2005 in Alberta, Canada. Demographic
and treatment information captured in the Alberta Cancer Registry were linked to: 1) hospital discharge data to
determine comorbidities, 2) electronic medical records to identify consults with oncologists, and 3) the 2001 Canadian census for neighborhood-level socioeconomic data. Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to
identify patient characteristics that were associated with not having a consultation with a medical oncologist and not
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 772 patients who underwent surgery for stage III colon adenocarcinoma and met the eligibility criteria, 618 patients (80%) had a consultation with an oncologist. Of those, 388
patients (63%) initiated adjuvant chemotherapy within 84 days of their surgery. Patient characteristics that were
associated with not having a consultation with an oncologist were neighborhood income, geography, age, and
comorbidities. Of those patients who had a consultation, after adjusting for comorbidities, only older age was related
to not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the proportion of patients
with stage III colon adenocarcinoma who did not receive treatment according to evidence-based guidelines was
appreciable. The authors concluded that the association of this failure with patient age, geography, and income is

Treatment guidelines for stage III colon adenocarcinoma have been in place since 1990,1 after a large, randomized,

controlled trial2 demonstrated a relative risk reduction of 40% for recurrence and of 33% for mortality in patients who
received postsurgical (ie, adjuvant) chemotherapy. The guidelines state that patients with stage III adenocarcinoma should
undergo surgery followed by chemotherapy. Despite the survival advantage and the general acceptance of adjuvant chemotherapy as the standard of care, several studies conducted in the United States have indicated that a large proportion of
patients do not receive it or experience treatment delays.3-8 To our knowledge, there has only been 1 study conducted in
Canada that has measured adherence to guidelines for patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma.9 That populationbased study, which covered 3 provinces, indicated that approximately 50% of patients who were diagnosed in 2004 did
not receive adjuvant chemotherapy.
To deliver optimal, evidence-based cancer care, it is important that cancer treatment guidelines are followed. In the
current population-based study, we investigated patient characteristics associated with not receiving care according to the

guidelines for patients who are diagnosed with stage III
colon adenocarcinoma in Alberta. In Alberta, all nonsurgical cancer treatment occurs in provincially coordinated
and accredited cancer care facilities. To receive treatment
according to the guidelines, a patient must undergo surgery, be referred to a cancer care facility for a consultation
with an oncologist, attend the consult, be recommended
to receive chemotherapy by the oncologist, and then agree
to receive the chemotherapy. We investigated patient
characteristics associated with not having a consultation
with an oncologist and not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy as a step toward understanding barriers to receiving
guideline-recommended treatment for patients with stage
III colon adenocarcinoma. Factors of interest included
patient and disease characteristics, region of residence,
and several neighborhood-level socioeconomic variables
based on census data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
In Alberta, a province with a population of approximately
3 million, physicians and hospitals are legally required to
report all cancer cases to the Alberta Cancer Registry, a
member of the North American Association of Comprehensive Cancer Registries that has a proven record of high
quality in its annual review.10 By using this comprehensive registry, all patients who had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of stage III colon adenocarcinoma
(International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
[ICD-O],11 code c18) between 2002 and 2005 and
underwent surgery were identified and included in the
study. Cancer stage was determined using the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (6th edition)12 staging rules. Stage III is defined as a tumor that has spread to
regional lymph nodes (N1 or N2) but not to distant metastatic sites (M0). Patients were excluded if they died
within 1 week of their diagnosis (to eliminate those who
did not have an opportunity to receive appropriate treatment), if they were diagnosed with another cancer within
the preceding or subsequent 6 months of their diagnosis
(to avoid treatment decisions that might have been influenced by another cancer), or if they were treated outside
of Alberta.
Extraction/Collection of Data on Potential
Explanatory Variables
Histologic grade (the sixth digit of the ICD-O code, third
edition11), sex, age at diagnosis, postal code at diagnosis,

and healthcare region (termed Regional Health Authority
[RHA]) of residence at diagnosis were obtained from the
Alberta Cancer Registry. During the period in question
(2002-2005), there were 17 cancer facilities throughout
the province, 6 of which had oncologists (or, at 1 facility,
internists with an interest in medical oncology) on site to
provide treatment consultations with patients, including
2 tertiary cancer centers and 4 associate cancer centers
(Fig. 1). Oncologists located at these 6 cancer facilities
provided consultations to discuss treatment options for all
cancer patients in the province. The 2 tertiary centers are
located in the largest cities, Edmonton (RHA 6) and Calgary (RHA 3), where 66% of the provincial population
resides. The 4 associate cancers centers are located in
smaller cities located throughout the province and include
2 in southern Alberta, 1 in central Alberta, and 1 in

northwestern Alberta. The minimum distance between
each patient’s residential postal code at the time of their
diagnosis and the postal code of the closest of the 6 cancer
facilities that provide consults with oncologists was calculated using the driving direction link from the internet
Yellow Pages (available at: http://www.yellowpages.ca
accessed June 19, 2009). We assumed that all patients living in the 2 large cities of Alberta, Edmonton and Calgary,
had the same driving distance to the respective city’s cancer care facility, which was calculated as the average distance for a 15% random sample of residential postal codes
within each city’s boundaries.13
Data from the 2001 Canadian census were used to
obtain area-level variables that were related to socioeconomic status in which the geographic area, called a dissemination area, is a neighborhood of approximately 600
households. Five variables that were indicative of socioeconomic status14 were included: 1) median income; 2)
proportion of employment; 3) proportion not graduated
from high school; 4) proportion separated, divorced, or
widowed; and 5) proportion living alone.
Comorbidity scores were calculated using outpatient
data from all Alberta hospitals, known as the Ambulatory
Care Classification System, and inpatient data from all
Alberta hospitals, known as the Discharge Abstracts Database. Specifically, diagnosis codes from these databases
were obtained for patients in the cohort that occurred
within 1 year before diagnosis and were merged with the
cohort dataset by using patient identifiers; International
Classification of Diseases version 9-Clinical Modification
(comorbidities) (ICD-9-CM) and International Classification of Diseases version 10-Canada (ICD-10-CA) diagnosis codes were used to calculate a comorbidity score for
each patient. Comorbidity scores were calculated based
on an updated version of the index described by Deyo
et al.15 and developed by Quan et al.16 using enhanced
ICD-9-CM coding algorithms and incorporating ICD10 codes. For the purposes of analysis, these scores were
categorized as 0 and 1, which represent ‘‘no serious
comorbidity’’ and ‘‘1 or more serious comorbidities,’’
respectively.
Extraction/Collection of Outcome Data
The primary outcomes of interest were: 1) not having a
consultation with an oncologist within 6 months of diagnosis and 2) not receiving standard treatment, which was
defined as surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy within 84
days postsurgery (the outer time limit for initiating adjuvant chemotherapy specified in the colon cancer clinical

Cancer

practice guidelines for Alberta).17 Previously, we observed
that consultations with oncologists that occurred more
than 6 months after the diagnosis date were not related to
initial treatment discussions18; therefore, we limited the
first outcome measure to consults within 6 months of
diagnosis.
To define the outcomes, starting dates and modalities of all initial treatments received for curative intent
(including surgery) were obtained from the Alberta Cancer Registry. If the dates of adjuvant chemotherapy were
missing or incomplete, then the cancer electronic medical
record was reviewed to complete the missing date information. The cancer electronic medical record was implemented in 2000/2001 and has been used extensively with
comprehensive quality-assurance procedures in place. The
date and facility of the first postsurgical consultation with
an oncologist also was obtained from the electronic cancer
medical record.

Statistical Analysis
The analysis was conducted in 2 stages. In the first stage,
associations of the potential explanatory variables with
failing to have a consultation were assessed in the entire
eligible patient cohort. Because having a consult with an
oncologist is a required precursor to receiving adjuvant
chemotherapy, the second stage of the analysis examined
associations of the potential explanatory variables with
failing to receive adjuvant treatment in the subcohort of
patients who had a consultation with an oncologist.
In each stage of the analysis, we started with descriptive analysis, quantifying the proportion who did not
receive a consultation with an oncologist and, among
those who attended the consultation, the proportion who
did not receive adjuvant treatment. Then, we calculated
these proportions stratified by each of the potential explanatory variables, assessing their bivariate associations
using chi-square tests (or Fisher exact tests if necessary).
To summarize the independent associations of multiple
explanatory variables simultaneously, log-binomial regression analysis with backward selection was conducted. For
convergence issues in the log-binomial model, the COPY
method19 was used with 999 copies. To facilitate interpretation, this method, which provides relative risk estimates,
was selected for use in the current analysis over the more
popular logistic regression, which provides odds ratio estimates. P values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a large-sample approximation of the
regression.

Continuous variables were evaluated both as continuous and categorical variables as part of exploratory data
analysis. Cutoff points for categorizing continuous variables in the final analyses were based on identified thresholds beyond which an effect was observed. Neighborhood
median income, however, was categorized into quartiles
based on the entire Alberta population. Histologic grade
was categorized as well/moderately differentiated (grades
1 and 2) and poorly/undifferentiated (grades 3 and 4).
Lymph node status was categorized as 1 to 3 positive
lymph nodes and 4 or more positive lymph nodes, corresponding to lymph node status of N1 and N2, respectively, using AJCC TNM classification rules.12 For
analyses that involved the region of residence, some
regions were collapsed because of small numbers; specifically, the following RHAs were combined: RHAs 1 and 2
were combined as Southern Alberta; RHAs 4 and 5 were
combined as Central Alberta; and RHAs 7, 8, and 9 were
combined as Northern Alberta. Age was categorized as
<70 years, 70 to 74 years, and >74 years to maintain reasonable numbers in each age category and to ensure consistency across analyses. All analyses were performed using
SAS statistical software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS
In total, 842 Alberta residents were diagnosed with stage
III colon cancer between 2002 and 2005. Sixty-nine
patients (8.2%) were excluded for 1 or more of the following reasons: 17 patients did not have an adenocarcinoma,
13 patients died within 7 days of their diagnosis, 3 cases
were not histologically confirmed, 41 patients had
another cancer diagnosis within 6 months, 3 patients did
not undergo surgery, and 1 patient treated outside of
Alberta. Our analysis included the remaining 772 patients
with stage III, surgically treated colon adenocarcinoma.
Tables 1 and 2 display the distribution of various
patient characteristics and socioeconomic indicators that
were evaluated in the current study, respectively, and the
relation of those characteristics to each of the outcome
variables. Of the 772 patients, 618 (80%) had a consultation with an oncologist within 6 months of their diagnosis. Of those 618 patients, 388 (63%) received adjuvant
chemotherapy.
Table 3 presents the results of the multivariate logbinomial regression for both outcome variables. Factors
that were associated independently with not receiving a
consultation were the presence of comorbidities

4852

(P ¼ .0002), older age (P < .0001), residence outside of
the Edmonton area (RHA 6; P ¼ .029), and lower median
neighborhood income (P ¼ .001). Patients aged 75
years were 8.7 times more likely not to have a consultation
with an oncologist than patients aged <70 years. Compared with patients who lived in the Edmonton area,
those who lived in Southern Alberta and those who lived
in the rest of the province were 1.7 times and approximately 1.4 times more likely to not have a consultation
with an oncologist, respectively. Patients who lived in the
lowest median income quartile neighborhoods were twice
as likely to not have a consultation with an oncologist
compared with patients who lived in the highest median
income quartile neighborhoods. Of those patients who
had a consultation with an oncologist, those aged 75
years were approximately 3 times more likely to not
receive adjuvant chemotherapy than those aged <70 years
after adjusting for the presence of serious comorbidities.

DISCUSSION
After a series of studies conducted in the United States
that identified patient characteristics associated with not
receiving guideline-recommended adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma,3-9 in
the current study, we investigated whether similar population-based observations could be made in a similar patient
cohort in Alberta. Patient characteristics that were associated with not having a consultation with an oncologist
also were investigated.
Between 2002 and 2005, 20% of patients with stage
III colon adenocarcinoma in Alberta did not have a consultation with an oncologist, which is a prerequisite to
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The variability of
patients who had a consultation with an oncologist based
on region and income is concerning, especially because
consulting with a specialist is a service that does not have
any direct cost to any resident of Alberta. It is possible,
however, that residents in lower income areas are less able
to take time off from work or have other barriers, such as
transportation or child care issues, to attending a consultation with an oncologist. It is noteworthy that, the regional
variation was not explained by distance to the closest cancer facility, although many patients traveled >200 kilometers to consult with an oncologist. This finding is
consistent with other studies that evaluated treatment in
patients with lung cancer20 and the receipt of adjuvant
chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer21 living
in rural regions. Although it was not possible in the

this possibility needs to be better elucidated.
Few studies have quantified the percentage of

with other studies conducted in the United States,3-8 age
was the factor related most significantly to not receiving
guideline-recommended treatment after adjusting for
comorbidities, although studies have demonstrated that
neither the survival advantage6,23 nor toxicity23 of adjuvant chemotherapy are related to age in patients with stage
III colon adenocarcinoma.
Large studies conducted in the United States based
on Medicare patients (aged 65 years) diagnosed in the
early to middle 1990s indicated that 50%8 to 55%5 of
patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma received adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas an estimate for patients
who were diagnosed in 20023 was 63%. A study that was
conducted on patients identified from 3 regions that comprise part of the California Cancer Registry in 1996 and
19977 indicated that 67% of patients with stage III colon
adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery also received adjuvant chemotherapy. Our finding that, overall, 50% of
patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma underwent

surgery was lower compared with findings from the US
studies described above. This difference may be attributable to differences in the private and public healthcare systems. Specifically, uninsured patients in the United States
may not be captured in these nonpopulation-based studies; whereas, in Alberta, everyone is insured publicly, and
the complete cost of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III
colon cancer is covered by the provincial healthcare insurance plan.
A limitation to the current study is that we did not
have detailed data related to surgical complications that
may have delayed or prevented wound healing or patient
functional status24; therefore, we do not know definitively
which patients were not medically appropriate candidates
for chemotherapy. Studies conducted in the United
States3-8 have had the same limitations; thus, comparisons
can be made across these studies with respect to both the
percentages of patients who did not receive adjuvant
chemotherapy and the factors related to not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.
Functional status is a potentially important clinical
factor for recommending adjuvant chemotherapy and,
although it is related to the presence of comorbidities,
reportedly is poorly correlated with comorbidity scores.24
Future studies should capture both functional status and
comorbidities to determine whether they explain most of
the age effect for not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy
among patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma.
Another study limitation is that we were not able to
identify whether or not patients refused chemotherapy.
Other studies have demonstrated that physician recommendation is the largest factor for determining whether a
patient accepts a particular treatment option.25,26 It has
been reported that, to accept a certain treatment, older
patients require a greater survival advantage than younger
patients for the same toxicity risk.26,27 The adjuvant
chemotherapy options for patients with stage III colon
cancer, however, are fairly well tolerated and do not usually predispose patients to high-grade toxicities. Patient
preference, therefore, is not likely to explain the large age
effect we observed in the current study.
In summary, we observed that, overall, 50% of
patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma did not
receive guideline-recommended adjuvant chemotherapy
