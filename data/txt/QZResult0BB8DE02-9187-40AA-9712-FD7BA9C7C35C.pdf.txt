BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to investigate the role of postremission consolidation chemotherapy before
reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in
first complete remission (CR1). METHODS: Of the 789 consecutive patients with AML in CR1 who underwent RIC alloSCT from a
human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling or matched unrelated donor peripheral stem cell grafts between 2001 and 2010, 591
patients received at least 1 cycle of consolidation chemotherapy and 198 patients did not receive any consolidation chemotherapy
before alloSCT. To minimize inherent survival bias in favor of patients who underwent transplant long after achieving CR1, the study
focused on 373 patients who underwent transplant within the median time frame between achievement of CR1 and alloSCT (3 months
for patients who underwent alloSCT from matched siblings and 4 months for patients who underwent alloSCT from matched unrelated donors). In this subgroup, 151 patients did not receive any consolidation chemotherapy and 222 patients received  1 consolidation chemotherapy cycle. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 2 months-135 months), the 3-year cumulative
recurrence incidence (RI) was not significantly different between the groups (36% 6 4% for the group treated without consolidation
chemotherapy vs 38% 6 3% for patients who received consolidation chemotherapy; P 5.89). In addition, leukemia-free survival was
similar between the groups (45% 6 4% and 47% 6 3%, respectively; P 5.41). Dose intensity of cytarabine given during consolidation
chemotherapy appeared to have no influence on RI. On multivariate analysis, pretransplant consolidation ( 1 cycle vs 0 cycles) was
found to have no significant impact on RI (hazards ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.97 [P 5.24]) or leukemia-free survival
(hazards ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.42 [P 5.99]). CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study suggest no apparent advantage for postremission consolidation chemotherapy before RIC alloSCT, provided a donor is readily available. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
The role of consolidation chemotherapy after successful
remission induction is well established in the treatment
paradigm of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
in first complete remission (CR1) in the nontransplant
setting.1-3 Consolidation chemotherapy courses have
been proven to decrease leukemia recurrence and improve
survival. Thus, most contemporary treatment protocols
for young patients with AML in CR1 who are not undergoing transplantation include repetitive cycles of highdose cytarabine.1-4 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation
(alloSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for patients
with AML that likely provides the most potent antileukemic effect of any postremission strategy.5 Nevertheless,
whether there is a need for postremission consolidation
chemotherapy before alloSCT is an unresolved issue. In
the standard myeloablative conditioning (MAC) alloSCT
setting, pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy did
not prove to have a significant beneficial impact on the
overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), or recurrence incidence (RI) of patients with AML in CR1, as
suggested by 2 large retrospective registry analyses from
the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry
(IBMTR) and the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).6,7 Thus, for a patient with
AML in CR1 who is a candidate for alloSCT with MAC,
there may be no need for consolidation chemotherapy
before proceeding to transplantation. Nevertheless, this
conclusion may not be applicable to the reduced-intensity
conditioning (RIC) alloSCT setting, which relies mainly
on the immunologic graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect
rather than on the antileukemic potency of the preparative
regimen.8-11 Given the possible increased risk of AML recurrence after RIC alloSCT, one may hypothesize that an
improved reduction of leukemic burden by consolidation
chemotherapy before transplantation is mandatory if one
wants to reduce the posttransplant RI and thereby
improve transplantation outcome. However, to the best
of our knowledge, the value of consolidation chemotherapy before RIC alloSCT in patients with AML in CR1
has not yet been investigated. In addition, the optimal
number of consolidation chemotherapy cycles that should
be given before RIC alloSCT and the questionable
advantage of higher versus lower doses of cytarabinebased consolidation are also issues of concern. Nonetheless, one must also acknowledge that the toxicity resulting
from unnecessary consolidation chemotherapy may preclude subsequent alloSCT or increase transplant-related
morbidity and mortality. Thus, the objective of the current multicenter retrospective analysis was to assess the
856

role of pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy before
RIC alloSCT in a large cohort of patients with AML in
CR1 who received human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor (MUD) peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria and Data Collection

The current study was a retrospective study performed by
the Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) of the
EBMT. The scientific board of the ALWP approved the
study. Patients with AML were selected from the registry
according to the following criteria: 1) age  18 years at
the time of transplantation; 2) in CR1; 3) requiring only
1 or 2 cycles of induction to achieve CR1; 4) receiving
their first SCT; 5) matched sibling or MUD transplant
was used; 6) RIC was used; 7) unmanipulated PBSC
grafts were used; and 8) patients underwent transplant
between 2001 and 2010. Demographic data, details
regarding transplantation, and posttransplantation
updates were extracted from the EBMT database. Furthermore, for the purpose of the current study, additional
data were requested from investigators and collected.
Transplant centers received a specifically designed questionnaire that asked for details concerning characteristics
of induction and postremission consolidation chemotherapy, including the number of induction cycles (including
drug composition and exact dosages) and the number of
consolidation cycles (including drug composition and
exact dosages).
Definitions

Cytogenetic subgroups were defined as previously
described.12 The number of induction cycles (1 cycle vs 2
cycles) was defined according to the number of induction
cycles needed to achieve CR1. Among patients who
achieved CR1 after 1 cycle of induction chemotherapy
but who received a second induction cycle as per protocol,
the second cycle was considered to a consolidation cycle as
part of the current analysis. The dose intensity of cytarabine was defined as follows: standard dose, 100 to 200
mg=m2 per dose; high-dose,  1 g=m2 per dose; and intermediate dose, a dose falling between the standard dose
and high-dose regimens.6,13
According to EBMT criteria, RIC was defined as 1)
oral busulfan at a dose of < 8 mg=kg or intravenous
busulfan at a dose of < 6.4 mg=kg with or without total
body irradiation (TBI)  6 gray (Gy) (fractionated) with
or without purine analog with or without antithymocyte
globulin (ATG); 2) cyclophosphamide at a dose of

60 mg=kg with or without TBI  6 Gy (fractionated)
with or without purine analog with or without ATG; 3)
melphalan at a dose of 140 mg=m2 plus fludarabine with
or without ATG; and 4) TBI  6 Gy (fractionated) with
or without purine analog with or without ATG.14
Statistical Analysis

Patient-related and disease-related variables of the 2
groups (those who received consolidation chemotherapy
vs those who did not) were compared using the chi-square
test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U
test for continuous variables. Variables considered were
patient age at time of transplantation, cytogenetic risk
group, number of induction cycles to achieve CR1, interval from CR1 to transplantation, type of donor, conditioning regimen (TBI vs chemotherapy alone), and the
use of ATG. LFS was defined as survival without evidence
of disease recurrence or progression. Nonrecurrence mortality (NRM) was defined as death while the patient was
in CR. Cumulative incidence curves were used for RI and
NRM in a competing risk setting because death and disease recurrence are competing together and the Gray test
was used for univariate comparisons.15 Probabilities of
OS and LFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimates. The log-rank test was used for univariate comparisons. All factors studied were included in the Cox
proportional hazards model.16 Interactions between the
use of consolidation chemotherapy, interval from CR1 to
transplantation, and each other factor were systematically
tested. The interval from CR to transplant was included
in the Cox model as a continuous variable. Proportional
hazards assumptions were checked systematically using
the Grambsch-Therneau residual-based test.17 All tests
were 2-sided. The type I error rate was fixed at 0.05 for
the determination of factors associated with time-to-event
outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
(version 19; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) and R (version
2.13.2; R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) statistical software packages.
RESULTS
Overall Outcome

From January 2001 to December 2010, 2560 patients
with AML in CR1 had undergone an alloSCT after a RIC
regimen and were registered in the ALWP of the EBMT
database. Extensive data (Med A and B and a specifically
designed questionnaire) regarding 1125 patients (44%)
were provided by 75 participating centers (32%). A total
of 789 of these 1125 patients (70%) met the inclusion criteria. In the current study cohort, 591 patients received at

least 1 course of consolidation chemotherapy before
alloSCT and 198 patients did not.
With a median follow-up of 40 months from transplantation (range, 1 month-140 months), the KaplanMeier estimates of OS and LFS at 3 years were 55% (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 52%-59%) and 52% (95%
CI, 48%-55%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of
disease recurrence was 33% (95% CI, 29%-36%) and the
cumulative incidence of NRM was 15% (95% CI, 13%18%).
The median time between achievement of CR1 and
undergoing alloSCT was 3 months for patients who
received transplants from a sibling donor (range, 0.3
months-15 months) and 4 months for patients who
received MUD transplants (range, 0.2 months-12
months) (P 5 .001). The median time from CR1 to
alloSCT was found to be longer among patients who
received consolidation chemotherapy compared with
those who received no consolidation chemotherapy (4.7
months vs 2.2 months; P < .001). Among patients who
underwent transplant within the median time between
CR1 and alloSCT, 40% did not receive any consolidation
chemotherapy (151 of 373 patients), whereas among
those patients who underwent transplant beyond the median time, only 11% did not receive any consolidation
chemotherapy (47 of 416 patients) (P < .001).
It is interesting to note that among patients who
received pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy
(n 5 591), those who underwent transplant beyond the
median time frame between CR and transplantation
(n 5 369) had an improved 3-year LFS compared with
patients who underwent transplant within the median
time frame (n 5 222) (58% [95% CI, 53%-64%] vs 47%
[95% CI, 41%-54%], respectively; P 5 .002). Although
NRM was not found to be significantly different between
the 2 groups (14% [95% CI, 10%-18%] vs 14% [95%
CI, 10%-20%]; P 5 .43), this was solely due to a lower RI
in patients who underwent transplant beyond the median
time frame (28% [95% CI, 23%-33%] vs 38% [95% CI,
31%-44%], respectively; P 5 .009), which was irrespective of the number of consolidation cycles actually delivered (1 cycle vs > 1 cycle), thus reflecting a selection bias
in favor of patients surviving longer without disease recurrence occurring before transplantation.

transplant long after achieving CR1, we elected to focus
on the group of 373 patients who underwent transplant
within the median time frame between CR1 and alloSCT
(3 months for patients receiving a matched sibling transplant and 4 months for patients receiving a MUD transplant) (Table 1). In this subgroup, 151 patients did not
receive any consolidation chemotherapy and 222 patients
received  1 consolidation chemotherapy cycle (164
patients received 1 cycle and 58 patients received  2
cycles). Patients treated without consolidation chemotherapy were older (median age, 58 years vs 56 years;
P 5 .03), had a shorter time from CR1 to alloSCT (56
days vs 71 days; P < .001), more often required 2 inductions to achieve CR1 (80% vs 35%; P < 0.001), more often received TBI-based conditioning (57% vs 23%;
P < .001), and less frequently received ATG (29% vs
42%; P 5 .008). Factors such as year of alloSCT, patient
sex, cytogenetic risk group, donor type (MUD vs sibling),
and female donor-to-male recipient sex combination were
not found to be significantly different between the 2
groups. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 2
months-135 months), the 3-year cumulative incidence of
disease recurrence was not found to be significantly different between the 2 groups (36% [95% CI, 28%-44%] for
patients with no consolidation chemotherapy and 38%
[95% CI, 31%-45%] for patients who received consolida858

tion chemotherapy; P 5 .89). In addition, LFS was similar between the groups (45% [95% CI, 36%-53%] vs
47% [95% CI, 41%-54%], respectively; P 5 .41) (Table
2). It is interesting to note that the dose intensity of cytarabine given during consolidation chemotherapy and the
number of consolidation cycles was found to have no
impact on RI and LFS.
To further minimize the potential selection bias that
would favor those patients who did not develop disease recurrence before transplantation despite not receiving any
consolidation chemotherapy, we compared the subgroup
of patients without consolidation chemotherapy who
merely underwent transplant within 2 months from CR
(n 5 74) with the group of patients receiving consolidation chemotherapy and who underwent transplant within
the median time frame between CR1 and alloSCT
(n 5 222; 3 months for patients with sibling donors and 4
months for patients with MUDs), and the outcomes were
still comparable (P 5 .89).
On multivariate analysis adjusting for patient age,
cytogenetic risk group, number of induction cycles, time
from CR to transplantation, donor type, conditioning
regimen category, and use of ATG, delivering pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy ( 1 cycle vs 0 cycles)
appeared to have no significant impact on RI (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.29; 95% CI, 0.84-1.97 [P 5 .24]) or LFS (HR,

of cytogenetics was essentially found in patients who
underwent transplant early after achieving CR. Taking
this interaction into account, poor cytogenetics was associated with higher rates of disease recurrence (HR, 6.65;
95% CI, 2.76-16 [P < .0001]), lower LFS (HR, 3.6; 95%
CI, 1.67-7.74 [P 5 .001]), and lower OS (HR, 3.32; 95%

Outcome of Patients Who Underwent
Transplant Beyond the Median Time Frame
Between CR1 and alloSCT

In the subgroup of patients who underwent transplant
beyond the median time frame between CR1 and
alloSCT, only 47 patients did not receive any consolidation chemotherapy whereas 369 patients received  1
consolidation chemotherapy cycle (170 patients received
1 cycle and 199 patients received  2 cycles). With a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 1 month-140
months), the 3-year LFS rate was significantly lower for
patients with no consolidation chemotherapy compared
with patients with consolidation chemotherapy (43%
860

[95% CI, 28%-57%] vs 58% [95% CI, 53%-64%],
respectively; P 5 .03). Although the RI was not found to
be significantly different between the groups (33% [95%
CI, 20%-47%] vs 28% [95% CI, 23%-33%]; P 5 .38),
these results were solely attributed to an increased NRM
rate among patients treated without consolidation chemotherapy (24% [95% CI, 13%-37%] vs 14% [95% CI,
10%-18%]; P 5 .09), most likely reflecting a selection
bias in favor of patients who were able to tolerate  1 consolidation chemotherapy cycles versus patients remaining
without consolidation chemotherapy for a prolonged period of time.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the current retrospective study was to
address a frequently encountered dilemma regarding
whether there is a need for postremission consolidation

chemotherapy in patients with AML in CR1 who are candidates for RIC alloSCT, provided a suitable donor is
readily available. As has previously been shown in the
standard MAC setting,6,7 the results of the current study
suggest that pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy
has no beneficial impact on the outcome of patients with
AML in CR1 who are receiving RIC alloSCT, because
patients with and without consolidation chemotherapy in
the current study had similar RI, LFS, and OS. Such comparable results were observed despite the finding that
patients who did not receive any consolidation chemotherapy were older (58 years vs 56 years; P 5 .03), more
often required 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy to
achieve CR1 (80% vs 35%; P < .001), and had a shorter
interval from CR1 to transplantation (56 days vs 71 days;
P < 0.001). The most likely explanation for the similar
RI, LFS, and OS outcomes noted among patients with
and without pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy is
the strength of the GVL effect provided by alloSCT,
which may overcome differences in the pretransplant leukemic cell burden.
One may challenge our method of distinguishing
between true induction failure and thus the existence of a
real need for a second induction cycle to obtain CR versus
a decision based merely on the finding of increased blast
cells in a bone marrow specimen that is hypocellular on
day 14 after the initiation of therapy, which has been proven to be an error in predicting that it reflects residual leukemia.18 Thus, some would venture that many patients
received a second cycle of induction chemotherapy that
was actually a form of consolidation, rather than a true
second induction. However, according to a survey conducted by the ALWP, although the exact timing may vary
among protocols, response assessment after induction
chemotherapy is usually performed between 21 days and
28 days after the initiation of therapy or at the time of peripheral blood recovery. If at that point the bone marrow
is hypoplastic, a repeat sample is obtained a week later.
Thus, the decision regarding whether to administer a second induction cycle truly reflects residual leukemia, and
thus the latter course should not be considered another
form of consolidation chemotherapy.
The current study data indicating a trend toward
higher NRM in patients who underwent transplant without consolidation chemotherapy (HR, 0.59; 95% CI,
0.32-1.09 [P 5 .09]) are not surprising given that the majority of these patients received 2 consecutive, intense,
induction cycles, thus exposing them to added toxicity
before transplantation. Moreover, the decision to go
directly to RIC alloSCT without any consolidation chemCancer

otherapy is not the standard of care and most likely indicates a subgroup of patients with comorbidities.
An important pitfall that we had to overcome during
the current analysis was the inherent survival bias in favor
of patients who underwent transplant long after achieving
CR1, which could have skewed our conclusions. Indeed,
it could be demonstrated that among patients who
received pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy, those
who underwent transplant beyond the median time frame
between CR1 and transplantation had a lower RI compared with those who underwent transplant within the
median time frame (28% vs 38%; P 5 .009). The latter
result was irrespective of the number of consolidation chemotherapies patients actually received (1 vs > 1), thus
reflecting a selection bias in favor of patients surviving
longer without disease recurrence before transplantation
(because patients with early disease recurrence would have
been excluded from the current analysis, which considered
only patients in CR1). Thus, to minimize this inherent
survival bias, we stratified patients according to time from
CR1 to transplantation and focused on the subgroup of
patients who underwent transplant within the median
time frame between CR1 and RIC alloSCT. Indeed, in
this subgroup, we observed that patients treated with or
without pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy had
comparable RI, LFS, and OS. It is interesting to note that
in the subgroup of patients who actually received consolidation chemotherapy within the median time frame
between CR1 and alloSCT, neither cytarabine dose intensity nor the number of consolidation cycles was found to
have an impact on RI, further supporting our findings
that there is no apparent advantage for pretransplant consolidation chemotherapy in the setting of RIC alloSCT.
As previously shown,19 patients with poor cytogenetics had increased RI and decreased LFS. However, this
impact was restricted to patients who underwent transplant
early rather than later after achieving a CR, again reflecting
a potential selection bias in favor of patients surviving longer without disease recurrence before transplantation.
Recently, several studies have demonstrated that
minimal residual disease (MRD) that is detectable by flow
cytometry at the time of MAC or RIC alloSCT was independently associated with increased RI and a shorter
disease-free survival and OS.20,21 Because we did not collect data regarding pretransplant MRD status, it is
unknown whether the lack of a benefit of postremission
consolidation chemotherapy extends equally to MRDnegative and MRD-positive patients. Thus, future studies
should address the issue of whether postremission consolidation chemotherapy could transform an MRD-positive

state into an MRD-negative one, and whether the achievement of such negativity before alloSCT improves the outcome in these patients.
In the current study, only patients who underwent
transplant with PBSC grafts were included. Recently,
Nagler et al compared outcomes of PBSCs versus the
bone marrow as the stem cell source for MUD RIC
alloSCT in patients with AML in CR.22 The RI at 2 years
was significantly higher among patients who underwent
transplant with bone marrow grafts compared with those
who underwent transplant with PBSC grafts (46% vs
32%; P 5 .014). These results were suggestive of a stronger GVL effect with PBSC grafts, which are known to
contain 20-fold more effector T cells compared with bone
marrow grafts.23,24 Thus, whether the results of the current study are applicable to patients who underwent transplant with bone marrow grafts remains an open question.
The current study has several limitations. First, there
was a lack of information regarding patients who were precluded from transplantation because of early disease recurrence or due to toxicities and mortality from consolidation
chemotherapy. Furthermore, we lacked data regarding the
reasons why patients were assigned their specific treatment.
Importantly, one should bear in mind that the findings of
the current study may not be applicable to patients with
AML in CR1 who are candidates for RIC alloSCT but for
whom a suitable donor is not immediately available. Such
patients may still need to receive “bridging” consolidation
chemotherapy while waiting for a donor to be identified in
an attempt to decrease the risk of early disease recurrence
before transplantation. The issue of the optimal dose of
cytarabine in this setting also needs to be determined.
In conclusion, the results of the current study clearly
suggest that, provided a suitable donor is readily available,
there is no significant benefit to adding consolidation
chemotherapy before RIC alloSCT, and that transplantation should be offered promptly at the time CR1 is
achieved without undue delay. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to confirm these results.
