Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–induced inflammation prevents
its broad application as an antitumor agent. We here report
that addition of ZnSO4 to the drinking water of mice induces
expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in several organs,
notably the gastrointestinal track. Zinc conferred doseresponsive protection against TNF-induced hypothermia,
systemic induction of interleukin-6 and NOx, as well as against
TNF-induced bowel cell death and death of the organism. The
protective effect of zinc was completely absent in mice deficient in the major HSP70-inducible gene, hsp70.1, whereas
transgenic mice constitutively expressing the human HSP70.A
gene, under control of a B-actin promoter, was also protected
against TNF, indicating that an increase in HSP70 is necessary
and sufficient to confer protection. The therapeutic potential
of the protection induced by ZnSO4 was clearly shown in a
TNF/IFN;–based antitumor therapy using three different
tumor models. In hsp70.1 wild-type mice, but not in hsp70.1deficient mice, zinc very significantly protected against lethality but left the antitumor effect intact. We conclude that zinc
protects against TNF in a HSP70-dependent way and that
protection by zinc could be helpful in developing a safer anticancer therapy with TNF/IFN;. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7301–7]

Introduction
The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was named after its
impressive antitumor activity (1). Indeed, TNF, especially in
combination with IFNg, can destroy tumors in experimental animals
and human patients (2). Unfortunately, TNF is also a proinflammatory cytokine whose injection leads to inflammation, hypotension,
liver toxicity, and bowel necrosis (3–5). This effect hampers the
systemic use of TNF in cancer patients. Therefore, the use of TNF is
restricted to regional treatment (6, 7). Moreover, TNF has also been
shown to be involved in important diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; refs. 8, 9). Inhibition
of the toxicity of TNF is thought to be important to broadening its
value as a therapy for cancer and to protect against arthritis and
IBD. We have reported recently that whole-body heat shock (WBHS)
of mice led to the induction of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and to
complete protection against TNF-induced lethality. This protection

depended on HSP70 (5). In our search for other inducers of HSP70,
we studied the effects of heavy metals. Most heavy metals are toxic,
but some, such, as zinc, are safe to use. Zinc is used to treat the
common cold, rhinitis, pneumonia, and dermatitis (10–14) and zinc
has been shown to protect in pig and rat models of endotoxemia
(15, 16). We here show that addition of zinc to the drinking water of
mice protected them against TNF-induced lethal shock, metabolic
disturbances, and bowel toxicity. Zinc-induced HSP70 and the
protection depended on the induced HSP70. The protection
conferred by zinc is so robust that it improves survival of tumorbearing mice during therapy with TNF and IFNg.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Female C57BL/6 mice were from Iffa-Credo and used at the age
of 8 to 10 weeks. Hsp70.1-deficient mice (C57BL/6 background) were
generated as described previously (5) and bred as homozygotes in our
facilities. Hsp70tg mice, expressing the human hsp70.A gene under control
of a h-actin promoter, were generated as reported (17). Wild-type (WT)
controls had an identical genetic background (17). Breeding couples were
kindly provided by Dr. G. Pagoulatos. All experiments were approved by the
ethics committee of the Faculty of Sciences of Ghent University.
Reagents. Recombinant mouse TNF and IFNg were produced in
Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity in our laboratories. TNF and
IFNg had specific activities of 1.2  108 and 1.16  107 IU/mg, respectively,
with no detectable endotoxin contamination.
Injections and blood collection. Cytokines and reagents were diluted
in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–free PBS before injecting them s.c. (0.1 mL), i.v.
(0.2 mL), or i.p. (0.5 mL). Blood was withdrawn from the retro-orbital plexus
and allowed to clot for 30 min at 37jC and overnight at 4jC, and the clot
was removed and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000  g for 10
min. Serum was prepared and stored at 20jC.
Tumor cell culture and inoculation. B16BL6, PG19, and LLC cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with FCS, antibiotics, and L-glutamine.
Cells were harvested, washed thrice in LPS-free PBS, and brought to a
concentration of 6  106/mL (B16BL6) or 50  106/mL (PG19 and LLC), of
which 100 AL were injected s.c. into the right hind limbs of the mice.
Tumor size index and body temperature. The smaller and larger
diameters of the tumors were measured with an electronic caliper, and
tumor size index (TSI) was calculated by multiplying these two values.
Rectal body temperature was determined with an electronic thermometer
(model 2001, Comark Electronics).
WBHS induction. A 20-min WBHS was induced as published (5, 18–20).
Tissue embedding, tissue sectioning, and staining. Mice were
euthanized and tissues were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
Tissues were passed through baths of 50%, 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol and
100% Histo-clear, embedded in paraffin, and cut at 4 Am with a microtome.
The sections were stained with H&E. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was done with
the DeadEnd colorimetric apoptosis detection system (Promega Biotec) as
described earlier (5).

Bioassays and detection of caspase activity. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6)
was determined with a 7TD1 bioassay (21). Serum nitrate and nitrite levels
(NOx ) were assessed essentially as described (22). Caspase-like activities in
bowel samples were determined using an acetyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-ValAsp(OMe)-aminomethyl-coumarin (Ac-DEVD-amc) system as described
previously (5).
Western blot. Total proteins (50 Ag) of the different tissue homogenates
were separated in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on a nitrocellulose
membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4jC. They were
incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a biotinylated mouse antiHSP70 antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp.), diluted 1:3,000 in BSA/
Triton X-100. After three washes, blots were incubated with streptavidin-AP
(1:1,500; BioSource International) and developed with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).
Statistical analysis. Survival curves (Kaplan-Meier plots) were compared using a log-rank test. Final mortality (deaths/total) were compared
with a m2 test. Means F SD were compared with a Student’s t test. *, **, and
*** represent 0.01 < P < 0.05, 0.001 < P < 0.01, and P < 0.001, respectively.

Results
Zinc induces HSP70 and protects mice against TNF-induced
lethality. To document the induction pattern of HSP70 by ZnSO4,
mice received water or 25 mmol/L ZnSO4 and sacrificed 7 days later.
The expression of HSP70 in liver, lung, jejunum, and colon was
studied by Western blotting. In mice receiving normal water, some
minimal background expression of HSP70 in liver, lung, and jejunum
was observed, as well as clear constitutive expression in the colon.
Addition of ZnSO4 to the drinking water led to increased expression
in liver and jejunum. On the other hand, expression in lung remained
rather low and expression in colon did not change (Fig. 1A).
To study the protective effect of ZnSO4 against TNF, we did a
dose response experiment. Mice received increasing doses of ZnSO4
in the drinking water (n = 15 for each group), and 7 days later, they
were challenged i.v. with 12.5 Ag TNF (i.e., a LD100 dose). Mortality
was scored up to 72 h after the challenge. We show (Fig. 1B) that

ZnSO4 conferred significant and dose-dependent protection against
TNF-induced mortality compared with control mice. Although all
three doses of ZnSO4 provided significant delay of death (P = 0.0209,
P = 0.0003, and P < 0.0001 for 5, 12.5, and 25 mmol/L, respectively),
the best protection in terms of final survival rate was observed with
the highest dose of ZnSO4 (13 of 15 survival for 25 mmol/L ZnSO4
versus 0 of 15 for controls; P < 0.0001). Increasing the concentration
of ZnSO4 had no additional protective effect.
To investigate the effects of ZnSO4/HSP70 on TNF-induced nitric
oxide (NO) and IL-6, mice received 25 mmol/L ZnSO4 (n = 36) or
water (n = 36), and 7 days later, they were challenged i.v. with 12.5 Ag
TNF (LD100). One, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h after the challenge, blood
was withdrawn and serum was prepared for nitrate/nitrite and
IL-6 determinations. ZnSO4 significantly inhibited NO production
9 h (P = 0.0163), 12 h (P = 0.0009), and 24 h (P = 0.0005) after the
challenge compared with the corresponding control groups
(Fig. 1C). It also reduced the levels of TNF-induced IL-6 after the
challenge (9 h, P = 0.034; 12 h, P = 0.0012; and 24 h, P = 0.0002;
Fig. 1D). These data show that ZnSO4 significantly blocks TNFinduced NO and IL-6 release, especially at the later time points,
leading to transient rather than sustained expression profiles.
When mice are treated with high doses of TNF, rapid swelling of
the intestine and epithelial damage are observed. This extremely
heavy damage supposedly plays an important role in lethality
because it may lead to influx of gut flora (4, 5). To evaluate
whether ZnSO4 prevents TNF-induced damage of the bowel, mice
received normal drinking water or ZnSO4 (n = 12), and 7 days
later, they were challenged with TNF (LD100). One hour after the
challenge, the whole small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and
ileum) was clamped, removed, and weighed with its content. We
show (Fig. 2A) that the weight of the small intestine of TNFtreated mice was significantly higher than that of PBS-treated
controls (P < 0.0001) and that ZnSO4 resulted in a significant
inhibition of the observed swelling (P = 0.0002). Part of the
jejunum was then isolated and homogenized, and the cleavage

unless otherwise indicated).

Zinc Protects against TNF

Figure 2. ZnSO4 prevents TNF-induced bowel necrosis. Mice received normal drinking water or 25 mmol/L ZnSO4, and 7 days later, they were challenged i.v. with
TNF. A, 1 h after the challenge, the entire small intestine was isolated and weighed with its contents. Parts of the jejunum were homogenized for assessment of

activity of the chromogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-amc was determined as a measure of the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7,
both known as executioner caspases. In jejunum homogenates of
mice challenged with TNF, we found a significant increase in
DEVD cleavage activity compared with homogenates from PBStreated mice (P = 0.0091). This increase was significantly inhibited
when TNF-challenged mice were pretreated with ZnSO4 compared

with TNF treatment (P = 0.0467; Fig. 2A). Samples of the jejunum
stained with H&E showed that treatment with TNF (Fig. 2B)
resulted in severe damage to the jejunum compared with
untreated animals (Fig. 2B). Villi are flattened because their distal
parts were eroded and denuded at the top. The crypts are
distended and contain mucus and debris. Pretreatment of mice
with ZnSO4 markedly reduced the damage (Fig. 2B): shortening of

the villi is less prominent and the crypts retain their normal
architecture. Tissue sections were also analyzed by TUNEL assay
to stain apoptotic cells. In control mice, no TUNEL staining was
observed (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the tops of the villi of TNF-treated
mice show positive TUNEL staining in the form of brown nuclear
staining (Fig. 2B). In mice receiving ZnSO4 in the drinking water,
TUNEL staining after TNF was nearly completely absent (Fig. 2B).
These data show that ZnSO4 completely prevents the TNF-induced
tissue damage and apoptosis in the jejunum.
Zinc does not protect in HSP70.1-deficient mice. Next, we
studied whether the protection by ZnSO4 is due to the induction
of HSP70 and therefore studied the effects of ZnSO4 in hsp70.1 /
mice. These mutant mice are as sensitive to TNF-induced mortality
as WT animals. hsp70.1 / mice received normal drinking water
(n = 11) or 25 mmol/L ZnSO4 (n = 12), and 7 days later, they were
challenged with 10 Ag TNF. As positive controls, WT mice received
normal drinking water (n = 11) or 25 mmol/L ZnSO4 (n = 13) and
were challenged with TNF. The induction of HSP70 by ZnSO4 is clear
in WT control mice but severely reduced in the hsp70.1 / mice
(data not shown). We observed some HSP70 induced by ZnSO4 in the
hsp70.1 / mice, but this signal probably results from induction of
the other inducible HSP70 gene, hsp70.3, which is located in the
same locus as hsp70.1, and which is still present in the hsp70.1 /
mice. The genes and protein sequences of HSP70.1 and HSP70.3 are
identical; hence, both are detected with our antibody. By contrast,
their respective promoter regions are different and they are controlled in a different manner (5). The residual HSP70 does not seem
to be sufficient to confer some protection against TNF. Indeed, WT
mice were very significantly protected (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3A), but
no protection whatsoever was observed in the hsp70.1 / mice (Fig.
3B). Furthermore, we observed that ZnSO4 significantly protected
against TNF-induced hypothermia (P < 0.0001), NO (P < 0.0001), and
IL-6 (P = 0.0036) in WT mice (measured 12 h after challenge), but
not in the hsp70.1 / mice (all variables P > 0.05; Fig. 3C and D).
These data show that all ZnSO4-mediated protective effects against
TNF require the induction of HSP70.1 and that HSP70.1 is needed
for the ZnSO4-induced inhibition of TNF-induced gene induction.

HSP70 transgenic mice are protected against TNF. The
hsp70tg (TG) mice express the human inducible hsp70.A gene
under control of the b-actin promoter and exhibit improved
recovery in a model of cardiac ischemia and reperfusion injury (7).
We studied the basal expression pattern of HSP70 in TG mice and
observed increased HSP70 expression in several organs compared
with isogenic WT controls (Fig. 4A). Next, we injected WT and TG
mice with 12.5 Ag TNF, a dose that was 100% lethal for the WT mice
(14 of 14), but only for 1 of 16 TG mice (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B). The TG
mice displayed a significantly reduced TNF-induced hypothermia
(P = 0.0049), NO (P = 0.0001), and IL-6 (P = 0.0009), as measured
12 h after challenge (Fig. 4C).
Zinc and WBHS protect against TNF/IFN; in three different
tumor models. Three different C57BL/6 syngeneic tumor models
were used in the following study. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated
with a B16BL6 melanoma, a PG19 melanoma, or LLC tumor.
Application of TNF together with IFNg induces regression of these
tumors, but it is accompanied with high mortality (2). To reduce or
inhibit this toxicity, we evaluated the application of ZnSO4 or
WBHS induction in an antitumor protocol. WBHS had been shown
to protect in the B16BL6 model before (5).
In all three antitumor experiments, mice were inoculated s.c.
with tumor cells on day 0 and divided randomly into six groups
on day 3. One group (n = 8) received daily s.c. injections of PBS for
10 days (days 11–20). The second group (n = 8) received daily
WBHS for 10 days (days 11–20). The third group (n = 8) was treated
with 25 mmol/L ZnSO4 in the drinking water starting from day 3 to
day 19. The other three groups (n = 10) were treated as the three
first groups but received daily s.c. injections of 10 Ag TNF in
combination with 5,000 IU IFNg for 10 consecutive days (days
11–20). TNF/IFNg was given 12 h after WBHS. The combination of
TNF and IFNg was administered s.c. near the tumor and not i.v.
because the former application allows the best tumor regression.
The TSI was recorded from day 10 (start treatment) until day 19 (stop
treatment). Mortality was monitored for 1 week after the last day of
treatment (no further deaths occurred). In the three tumor models,
mice treated with PBS, WBHS, or ZnSO4 displayed rapid tumor

growth, whereas TNF/IFNg treatment led to complete regression
of the tumor. Neither WBHS nor ZnSO4 pretreatment had any effect
on the antitumor effect of TNF/IFNg (Fig. 5A, C, and E). When
evaluating the toxicity of the treatment, it became clear that the dose

of TNF/IFNg in all three tumor models was very toxic, leading to
death of all the B16BL6 and PPG19 mice and to 9 of 10 of the LLC
mice (Fig. 5B, D, and F). In all three models, both WBHS and ZnSO4
had a very significant protective effect against death from the TNF/

and received PBS, WBHS, or ZnSO4, either alone (n = 8) or in combination with TNF/IFNg (n = 10). Tumor growth/regression was monitored (A, C , and E) and mortality
was recorded until 5 d after the end of the treatment (no further deaths occurred).

Figure 6. Protection of ZnSO4 against TNF/IFNg lethality in tumor-bearing mice
critically depends on HSP70. C57BL/6 (n = 19) and hsp70.1 -deficient
(n = 22) mice were inoculated with B16BL6 melanoma cells and treated with
water or 25 mmol/L ZnSO4 and a therapy with TNF/IFNg. Survival was recorded
up until the end of the treatment (no further deaths occurred).

IFNg treatment (see Fig. 5 for P values). In the B16BL6 model, zinc
was more effective than WBHS, but not in the other two models. The
data show that WBHS and ZnSO4 not only prevent TNF-induced
mortality but also allow application of TNF in combination with
IFNg as a safe antitumor strategy.
The protection of ZnSO4 against TNF/IFN; in tumor-bearing
mice also depends on HSP70. We wondered whether the hsp70.1
gene is also critical in the protection against TNF/IFNg in tumorbearing mice. B16BL6 tumors were inoculated in C57BL/6 mice
(n = 19) and in hsp70.1-deficient mice (n = 22) and the protection
of ZnSO4 in the drinking water was evaluated exactly as described
above. As can be seen in Fig. 6, zinc protected significantly in
the WT mice (P = 0.037), but not in the hsp70.1 knockout mice
(P = 0.157). Hence, zinc protected significantly better in the WT
mice compared with the knockout mice (P = 0.004).

Discussion
It has been known for a long time that treatment of tumor-bearing
mice with TNF leads to regression of the tumors. This effect is even
more pronounced when TNF is combined with IFNg or with
chemotherapeutics (2). The antitumor effect of TNF seems to result
from modulation/modification of the integrin avh3 specifically in
the tumor neovascular endothelial cells (23). The antitumor effect of
TNF/IFNg leads to complete regression of the tumors but is associated with considerable toxicity. Therefore, TNF is currently applied
in locoregional treatment schedules only (6, 7). The very powerful
proinflammatory nature of TNF is the source of its toxicity. Indeed,
TNF is produced by macrophages on stimulation with different
agents (e.g., endotoxin; refs. 1, 24). Hence, TNF plays a central mediating role in inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis
and IBD (8, 9). In patients suffering from these pathologies, TNFblocking agents, such as infliximab, have proven to be very effective
(25, 26). The major dose-limiting toxicities after TNF injection were
found to be liver toxicity, drop in blood pressure (shock), and bowel
necrosis (3). TNF is a very strong inducer of gene expression through
activation of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), and other kinases, and it is expected that the toxic

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

response is due to the effects of products of newly expressed genes.
Because the antitumor and shock-inducing properties of TNF are
based on different pathways (noninflammatory and inflammatory,
respectively), we reasoned that inhibition of the inflammation
induced by TNF could lead to a safer use of TNF in cancer patients
without compromising the antitumor effects.
Zinc is a heavy metal that has been shown to possess clear antiinflammatory properties. In rat and pig models of endotoxemia,
protection by zinc and induction of HSP70 have been described,
although no causal relationship between both activities were
shown (15, 16). In previous experiments, we found that treatment
of mice for 7 days with ZnSO4 in the drinking water increases the
expression of f2,700 genes, of which the inducible hsp70.1 gene is
a major and recurrent one.5 Furthermore, we had reported that
WBHS treatment of mice protected them from TNF-induced shock
in a strictly HSP70-dependent way.
The HSPs form a highly conserved family of stress proteins with
very diverse functions. Several genes encoding HSP70 are inducible
by many stress factors, including environmental stress, oxidative
stress, and inflammation. In mice, the major inducible HSP70encoding genes are hsp70.1 and hsp70.3, the former being the more
strongly induced.
We here investigated whether zinc could protect against
inflammatory shock induced by a single bolus injection of TNF.
We found that this indeed is the case. Simple addition of ZnSO4 to
the drinking water of mice conferred dose-responsive protection
against TNF-induced hypothermia, gene induction, and consequent
death. The protective effect of zinc on TNF-induced cell death in the
bowel is also very interesting because this toxicity has been reported
to be strongly associated with the final lethal outcome (4, 5). In
TNF-treated animals, apoptosis of epithelial cells leads to loss in
architecture of the intestine. This might result in an increased
uptake in the circulation of gut-derived endotoxins and in a drastic
sensitization to TNF (4). We believe that the inhibition of apoptosis
of enterocytes by HSP70 (induced by zinc) prevents such an
increased uptake and helps to rescue the organism. Indeed, sterilization of the gut by antibiotics significantly prevents TNF-induced
lethality.5 Because other groups have shown that zinc affects the
gut flora only very minimally (27, 28), we believe that the effect of
zinc on the jejenum is indeed through HSP70, at the level of
inhibition of apoptosis, as our data clearly show. It has been shown
(29) that zinc inhibits endonucleases that are involved in apoptosis
(29) and that zinc blocks caspase-3 activity (30). However, others
have shown that caspase inhibition does not protect against TNF
in vivo (31). Interestingly, it has been reported that HSP70 inhibits
the recruitment of procaspase-9 to the Apaf-1/apoptosome complex,
thereby preventing cytochrome c– and ATP-induced apoptosis (5).
We then show that zinc induces HSP70 expression in mice,
particularly in the liver and small intestine. This is a more specific
expression pattern compared with WBHS, which also induced
HSP70 in other organs, such as colon and lung (5). In hsp70.1deficient mice generated by gene targeting, zinc induced less
HSP70 in the small and large intestines and the protective effect of
zinc was completely absent. The hsp70.1 knockout mice, which are
not overly sensitive to TNF and have no obvious phenotypic

Zinc Protects against TNF

mice leads to protection against TNF, it is tempting to conclude
that HSP70 is sufficient to protect against lethal inflammation.
The mechanism by which HSP70 could protect against TNFinduced inflammatory shock remains unclear (and forms the basis
of our ongoing research). We believe that the answer lies in the
kinetics of gene induction, which are considerably changed by zinc
(through HSP70) from persistent to transient. Indeed, zinc seems to
inhibit the late phase of gene induction by TNF, as if zinc induces
an anti-inflammatory, gene repressing mechanism. Similar findings
were reported by Klosterhalfen et al. (15) in a pig model of endotoxemia. TNF-induced gene induction proceeds by activation of
major players, such as NFnB and MAPKs. It has been shown that
HSP70 interacts with Bag-1 (32), which under physiologic
conditions interacts with Raf-1 (33). The latter interacts with
MAPK kinase, leading to activation of transcription factors
involved in cell growth and differentiation (34). After induction,
HSP70 and Raf-1 compete for Bag-1 binding, resulting in
displacement of Bag-1/Raf-1 by Bag-1/HSP70 (34). Hence, HSP70
may affect the activation of transcription factors involved in the
induction of IL-6 and NO synthase. Other mechanisms by which
HSP70 may inhibit TNF-induced gene induction include enhanced
renaturation of InB (the major NF-nB inhibitor), inhibition of the
InB kinase (IKK) complex, binding to IKKg, or induction of MAPK
phosphatases (34). It remains to be investigated which of the
possible mechanisms are at work in this model.

Here, we show the role of ZnSO4 as a strong anti-inflammatory
agent in a Th1 cytokine-mediated disease. In addition, asthma, a
typical Th2-mediated disease, was recently also linked with zinc. It
was shown that nutritional Zn deficiency worsens allergic
inflammation. In addition, Zn supplementation led to significant
improvement in acute and chronic asthma mouse models (35, 36).
The therapeutic power of the anti-inflammatory zinc is clear
from the antitumor experiments. We show that treatment with zinc
(or WBHS) can protect the host against the toxic effects of the
combination of TNF and IFNg, without compromising any
antitumor activity. The protection conferred by zinc in this
anticancer protocol is clearly also depending on HSP70. We believe
that these data will form the basis for the development of a safer
antitumor treatment based on TNF/IFNg.
