Abstract
miR-124 targets the androgen receptor (AR) transcript,
acting as a tumor suppressor to broadly limit the growth of
prostate cancer. In this study, we unraveled the mechanisms
through which miR-124 acts in this setting. miR-124 inhibited
proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and sensitized
them to inhibitors of androgen receptor signaling. Notably,
miR-124 could restore the apoptotic response of cells resistant
to enzalutamide, a drug approved for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We used xenograft models to
examine the effects of miR-124 in vivo when complexed with

polyethylenimine-derived nanoparticles. Intravenous delivery
of miR-124 was sufﬁcient to inhibit tumor growth and to
increase tumor cell apoptosis in combination with enzalutamide. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-124 directly downregulated AR splice variants AR-V4 and V7 along with
EZH2 and Src, oncogenic targets that have been reported to
contribute to prostate cancer progression and treatment resistance. Taken together, our results offer a preclinical rationale
to evaluate miR-124 for cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 75(24);

Introduction

that is sufﬁcient to overcome ADT (4), the AR signaling inhibitor
(ARSI) enzalutamide has been developed for treating the disease
(5). This novel ARSI exhibits greater afﬁnity than bicalutamide for
the AR and dramatically inhibits AR function (6). Regrettably,
recent studies demonstrated that enzalutamide provides only a
modest improvement of survival in patients with prostate cancer
due to rapid development of drug resistance (7, 8). Therefore,
discovering new therapeutics for enhancing the efﬁcacy of enzalutamide is urgently needed.
microRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous noncoding small RNAs
and negatively regulate expression of multiple genes via sequencespeciﬁc interactions with the 30 -untranslated regions (UTR) of
cognate mRNA targets, leading to inhibiting translation or mRNA
degradation. It is estimated that miRNAs can regulate about 60%
of protein-coding genes (9). Unlike siRNAs, miRNAs do not
require perfect base pairing, and one miRNA has multiple different mRNA targets (10). Therefore, alteration in a single miRNA
may change the expression levels of different genes and subsequently affect the signaling pathways involved in a number of
physiologic as well as pathologic conditions including cancer.
Many miRNAs that act as tumor suppressors or as oncogenes were
reported to be aberrantly expressed in various cancer types (11).
These ﬁndings have generated signiﬁcant interest in using miRNAs
as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Indeed, a number of
miRNAs were found to inhibit in vivo growth of different human
cancer xenografts (12).
Of the known aberrantly expressed and cancer-related miRNAs,
miR-124 represents an ideal candidate for therapeutic development. Accumulating evidence indicates that miR-124 is a tumor
suppressive miRNA in several types of human cancer (13–15),

Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignant
tumor and the second leading cause of cancer death in American
men (1). Our recent study showed that for the past 20 years, the
survival for patients presenting in California with metastatic
prostate cancer has not improved (2). The androgen receptor
(AR) is critical for the development and progression of prostate
cancer. Until now, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), that
inhibits AR signaling, represents the primary therapy for patients
with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. Although it is
initially effective, patients invariably relapse and their tumors
progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; ref. 3).
Because CRPC is commonly associated with aberrant AR signaling

including prostate cancer. In previous studies, we reported that
miR-124 directly targets the AR transcript, that increasing its
expression inhibits growth of prostate cancer xenografts, and that
it is signiﬁcantly downregulated in clinical prostate cancer specimens (16), which is consistent with a previous observations by
Hellwinkel and colleagues (17). We deﬁned a molecular pathway
in which miR-124 targets AR, leading to decreased miR-125 levels
and an increased expression of p53. Thus, miR-124 was determined to drive prostate cancer cells toward apoptosis (16). These
previous data suggest that miR-124 is involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. In this study, the role of miR-124 was
further explored by using synthetic miR-124 mimics. We found
that miR-124 directly downregulates the levels of AR transcript
variants, as well as enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and Src
tyrosine kinase (Src). Systemic administration of miR-124 not
only potently inhibited growth of prostate cancer xenografts but
also sensitized prostate cancer tumors to enzalutamide treatment,
inducing increased apoptosis in vivo. These ﬁndings provide
proof-of-concept support for systemic delivery of miR-124 as an
adjuvant therapeutic agent for prostate cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Bicalutamide was obtained from AstraZeneca. Enzalutamide
(marketed as Xtandi and formerly known as MDV3100) was
obtained from Medivation, Inc. For in vitro studies, enzalutamide
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. For animal studies, enzalutamide was mixed with 0.5% Methocel A4M suspension (Kremer
Pigments Inc.). Ambion pre-miR-124 precursors (in vitro study)
and mirVana miR-124 mimics (in vivo study), as well as miRNA
negative control (miR-NC), were purchased from Ambion. Both
pre-miR-124 precursors and mirVana miR-124 mimics are small
double-stranded RNA molecules that mimic endogenous miR124 and upregulate miR-124 activity. Polyethylenimine (in vivojetPEI), a delivery vehicle used in laboratory and clinical trials, was
purchased from Polyplus-transfection, Inc. PEI-miR-124 complexes were prepared following the manufacturer's protocol. The
anti-AR-V7 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Precision
Antibody Store.
Cell lines and culture
Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2B, 22Rv1, and VCaP) were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS
(FBS medium) or in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum (androgen-deprived medium). To generate the
enzalutamide-resistant 22Rv1 subline, 22Rv1 cells were cultured in
androgen-deprived medium containing gradually increased concentrations of enzalutamide (from 5 to 40 mmol/L over 4 months).
The resultant enzalutamide-resistant 22Rv1 subline was termed
22Rv1-EnzR and maintained in androgen-deprived medium containing 10 mmol/L enzalutamide.
Cell proliferation assay
Prostate cancer cells (3  103/well) were seeded in 96-well
plates in FBS medium or androgen-deprived medium. After being
cultured for 24 hours, cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L
miR-124. After 5 hours, cells were treated with fresh medium
without or with 10 mmol/L enzalutamide or bicalutamide. A
tetrazolium-based cell proliferation assay (WST-1, Promega) was
carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Reporter plasmid construction and luciferase assay
To construct reporter plasmids, approximately 0.5-kb DNA
fragments containing the putative miR-124 binding sites were
prepared by high-ﬁdelity PCR from the 30 UTRs of individual genes
of interest. The corresponding fragments of 30 UTRs lacking the
miR-124–binding site were used as negative controls. DNA fragments were cloned into the pMIR-REPORT luciferase vector
(Ambion) downstream of the luciferase gene. The sequences and
cloning direction of these PCR products were validated by DNA
sequencing. For luciferase assays, cells (3  104/well) were seeded
into 24-well plates and cultured for 24 hours. The cells were
then cotransfected with reporter plasmids and 25 to 100 nmol/L
miR-124 mimics or miRNA-negative control (miR-NC). The pRLSV40 Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) was used as an internal
control. Two days later, cells were harvested and lysed with passive
lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a
dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega). The activities of the
pMIR-REPORT ﬁreﬂy test reporters were normalized by Renilla
luciferase activity.
Western blot assay
Total protein was extracted from cultured cells or xenograft
tumors, and the concentrations were estimated using the Coomassie (Bradford) Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts
of denatured protein samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE.
After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon
PVDF membrane. Immunoblotting was conducted using individual speciﬁc primary antibodies and appropriate horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies following standard
protocols.
Clonogenic assay
Six-well plates were seeded with 3  104 22Rv1-EnzR cells per
well and incubated overnight. Cells were transfected with
miR-124 or transfected with miR-124 for 3 days followed by
treatment with 10 mmol/L enzalutamide. After 2 weeks, cells were
stained with crystal violet (0.4% crystal violet in 20% methanol).
For quantitative clonogenic assays, the colonies were solubilized
with 30% acetic acid, and the absorbance was read at a wavelength
of 540 nm.
Animal experiments
Animal studies were performed according to the protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of California, Davis (Sacramento, CA). Male
athymic nude mice (4–6 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan
Laboratories and housed in pressurized, ventilated cages with
standard rodent chow and water and a 12-hour light/dark cycle.
The CWR22 xenograft tumor was a gift from Dr. Thomas A.
Pretlow (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). Xenografts were implanted by subcutaneous injection into the ﬂanks of
the mice with CWR22 cell suspensions (2  106 cells) in a
mixture (1:1 vol/vol) of culture medium and Matrigel (Becton
Dickinson). When tumor volume reached about 50 mm3, mice
were randomized into four treatment groups (n ¼ 8 mice per
group): negative control, miR-124, enzalutamide, and miR-124 þ
enzalutamide. Treatment was conducted by intravenous injection
of 10 mg jetPEI/miR-NC or 10 mg jetPEI/miR-124 complexes
(three times weekly for 5 weeks) or by oral administration of
enzalutamide (20 mg/kg/wk, once weekly for 5 weeks). During

After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated in buffer
containing TUNEL-peroxidase for 1 hour at 37 C. The reaction
was stopped by rinsing the slides in stop wash buffer. The
sections were then incubated with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine solution. After counterstaining with hematoxylin, the sections were

Results
miR-124 inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells alone or
in combination with ARSIs
Our previous studies revealed that miR-124 was downregulated in clinical prostate cancer samples and lentivirally
expressed miR-124 (lenti-miR-124) inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells, indicating that miR-124 acts as a tumor
suppressor (16). Hence, to explore miR-124 as a potential
therapeutic modality, we determined whether synthetic miR124 is able to decrease resistance of prostate cancer cells to
enzalutamide. For this purpose, both androgen-independent
22Rv1 and C4-2B cells grown in androgen-deprived medium
and androgen-dependent LNCaP cells in FBS medium were
treated with miR-124 and enzalutamide, alone or in combination. As shown in Fig. 1A–C, combination treatment resulted
in signiﬁcant inhibition of proliferation compared with the
single-agent treatment (P < 0.01). In addition, C4-2B cells were
treated with miR-124 and bicalutamide. Similarly, the combination treatment signiﬁcantly increased growth inhibition of
C4-2B cells (P < 0.01, Fig. 1D), which is accompanied with
obvious cell morphologic changes, characterized by cellular
shrinking or displaying an appearance of dying cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). These in vitro data provide evidence that miR124 increases therapeutic efﬁcacy of ARSIs.
miR-124 restores the response of prostate cancer cells to
enzalutamide
In our previous study, we found that miR-124 directly targets
full-length AR and downregulates the level of truncated ARs (16)
that are derived from AR transcript splice variants (18). Because
expression of AR variants mediates the development of resistance
to enzalutamide (19), we tested whether miR-124 is able to reduce
resistance of prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide. We established
an enzalutamide-resistant subline (22Rv1-EnzR) that displays an

www.aacrjournals.org

equivalent growth rate as the parental 22Rv1 cells (data not
shown), and an 8-fold increase in the expression of AR-regulated
miR-125b (Supplementary Fig. S2A). As miR-124 downregulates
miR-125b (16), we ﬁrst evaluated the effect of miR-124 on miR125b levels. Treatment with miR-124 induced a 52% reduction of
miR-125b (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The effect of miR-124 on
proliferation of 22Rv1-EnzR cells was then assessed. Consistent
with the results for the parental 22Rv1 cell line, in which miR-124
reduced clonogenic cells by 43%, treatment of 22Rv1-EnzR cells
with miR-124 resulted in a clonogenic inhibition by 36% when
compared with the miR-NC control (P < 0.01, Fig. 2A and B). Next,
we tested whether miR-124 was able to decrease the resistance of
22Rv1-EnzR cells to enzalutamide. In this regard, 22Rv1-EnzR
cells were ﬁrst transfected with miR-124 for 3 days followed by
enzalutamide treatment for 5 days. It was found that miR-124
treatment signiﬁcantly increased the efﬁcacy of enzalutamide
(10% in enzalutamide vs. 68% in enzalutamide þ miR-124,
P < 0.01; Fig. 2C). Data shown in Fig. 2 strongly suggest that
miR-124 is able to restore the responsiveness of 22Rv1-EnzR cells
to enzalutamide.
Identiﬁcation of miR-124 targets
To further understand the role of miR-124 in prostate cancer,
we performed miR-124 target prediction using the BIBISERV and
TargetScan programs and focused on prostate cancer metastasisand castration resistance–related genes. Three genes were predicted to be potential miR-124 targets on the basis of the presence
of miR-124–binding sites in their 30 UTRs: EZH2, Src, and STAT3,
which function as oncogenes and contribute to metastasis and
castration resistance of prostate cancer. To validate the in silico
predictions, luciferase assays of their 30 UTRs were completed.

examined the levels of EZH2 and total Src proteins in miR-124–
transfected 22Rv1 and C4-2B cells and found that miR-124
downregulated these two oncogenic proteins (Fig. 3C and D).
Although STAT3 was also identiﬁed as a high potential target of
miR-124, experimental data did not support this, at least in the
context of prostate cancer cells tested (data not shown).

miR-124 (50 nmol/L) in C4-2B cells resulted in a reduction of
luciferase activity by 46% (Fig. 3A). Similarly, cotransfection of
the luciferase-Src 30 UTR reporter and synthetic miR-124 induced a
42% decrease of the enzyme activity (Fig. 3B) when compared
with transfection with the negative control (miR-NC). Similar

Previous study demonstrated that miR-124 downregulated
truncated AR (16), suggesting a regulatory link between miR124 and AR splice variants that lack the AR ligand–binding
domain (LBD). In this study, we observed an increased expression
of AR-V7 in 22Rv1-EnzR cells compared with 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 4A).
We thus asked whether miR-124 directly targets AR-V7. Using
the BIBISERV program, we analyzed the 30 UTR sequences of
ﬁve AR variants deposited in the NCBI database: AR-V1 (also
termed AR4, GI:224181615), AR-V3 (also termed AR6 or AR1/2/2b,
GI:224181621), AR-V4 (also termed AR5, ARV6 or AR1/2/3/2b,
GI:224181619), AR-V7 (also termed AR3, GI:224181613), and
AR-V12 (also termed ARv567es, GI:270358641). One miR-124–
binding site was identiﬁed in the 30 UTRs of AR-V3, V4, and V7,
which contain an identical sequence of 1.3 kb in length (Fig. 4B,
top). However, an miR-124–binding site was not identiﬁed in ARV1, or in AR-V12 in which the 30 UTR length is 219 bases without a
poly-A tail, indicating an incomplete 30 UTR. To validate this
30 UTR element in AR-V3, -V4, and -V7 as being responsible for
their regulation by miR-124, a luciferase reporter vector containing the miR-124–binding site was cotransfected with synthetic
miR-124 into 22Rv1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4B (bottom), cotransfection resulted in a 62% reduction of the enzyme activity. Similar
results were obtained when the assay was performed in 293 cells
(data not shown). Using immunoblot analysis with the anti-ARV7 antibody, we evaluated the effect of miR-124 on the regulation
of AR-V7 protein level. Transfection of 22Rv1 cells with miR-124

for 3 days downregulated the expression of AR-V7 by 60%,
whereas enzalutamide treatment for 3 days did not alter AR-V7
level (Fig. 4C). In addition, immunostaining of miR-124–treated
22Rv1-EnzR cells for AR-V7 expression demonstrated a dramatic
reduction of AR-V7 intensity (Supplementary Fig. S3). Because
AR-V3 lacks exon 3 that is necessary for the AR binding to DNA,
transactivational function of AR-V3, -V4, and -V7 was assessed
using a yeast AR functional assay that can be used to detect
constitutive activity of AR spliced variants (Supplementary
Fig. S4A and S4B). Both AR-V4 and -V7, but not AR-V3, were
able to constitutively activate the expression of the reporter gene
ADE2 (Supplementary Fig. S4C), suggesting that miR-124–regulated AR-V4 and -V7, or lack thereof, contribute to prostate cancer
pathogenesis. Next, we determined whether miR-124 inhibits
growth of prostate cancer cells via its regulation of AR-V7. To
this end, both 22Rv1 and VCaP cell lines that express high level of
AR-V7 were transfected with 100 nmol/L siAR-V7 for 3 days,
followed by treatment with 50 nmol/L miR-124. Western blotting
demonstrated that siAR-V7 was able to dramatically downregulate the expression of AR-V7 protein but not the level of full-length
AR (Fig. 4D). WST proliferation analysis was then performed on
days 3 and 6 after miR-124 treatment. It was found that knockdown of AR-V7 truncates miR-124–mediated growth inhibition
in both 22Rv1 and VCaP cell lines (Fig. 4E). Taking the results
from Figs. 3 and 4 together, miR-124 directly targets EZH2 and Src,
as well as AR-V4 and -V7.

injected subcutaneously with CWR22 cell suspension (2  10 cells). When tumor volumes reached 50 mm , treatment was conducted by intravenous
injection of 10 mg jetPEI/miR-NC or 10 mg jetPEI/miR-124 complexes (three times weekly for 5 weeks) or by oral administration of enzalutamide (20 mg/kg/wk, once
weekly for 5 weeks). Tumor sizes were measured and tumor growth curves were obtained. Each time point represents mean  SD of 8 independent

miR-124 inhibits growth of prostate cancer xenografts and
sensitizes prostate cancer tumors to enzalutamide
Having validated that miR-124 negatively regulates the expression of AR variants and multiple oncogenes, we next investigated
whether systemic administration of synthetic miR-124 could
inhibit growth of CWR22 xenograft tumors. This xenograft model
was selected as (i) we detected the expression of AR-V7 in frozen
CWR22 tumors (data not shown) and (ii) Sirotnak and colleagues
found that the antiandrogen bicalutamide does not inhibit the
growth of the CWR22 tumors (20). In this experiment, miR-124
was delivered into CWR22 tumors by using the linear polyethylenimine derivative jetPEI that has been reported to efﬁciently
deliver miRNAs into tumor xenografts (21). In the mice of the
negative control treatment group (miR-NC), tumors rapidly
grew and all mice were sacriﬁced before day 35 due to tumors
reaching the maximal-acceptable size. In contrast, treatment with
miR-124 signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth, with almost a 50%
reduction of tumor volume at day 35 compared with that of
miR-NC–treated tumors (P < 0.05, Fig. 5A and B). We next
determined whether combined administration of miR-124 and
enzalutamide would result in enhanced inhibition of prostate
cancer cell growth. When compared with enzalutamide treatment,
combination treatment inhibited tumor growth by 54% on day
35 posttreatment (P < 0.05, Fig. 5A and B), indicating that miR124 increased anti–prostate cancer efﬁcacy of enzalutamide. In
addition, there were no safety concerns of PEI-miR-124 complexes based on observations that mouse body weights were
unchanged throughout the course of the study (data not
shown). Therefore, synthetic miR-124 is able to inhibit growth
of prostate cancer tumors when given by itself or in combination with enzalutamide.
miR-124 downregulates AR-V7, EZH2, and Src and induces
apoptosis in CWR22 xenografts
Upon termination of the in vivo experiments described above,
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to determine the
levels of the AR-V7 protein in the xenograft tumors. Treatment
with miR-124 alone or in combination with enzalutamide caused
a marked decrease in the immunostaining intensity compared

5314 Cancer Res; 75(24) December 15, 2015

with treatment with miR-NC or enzalutamide alone (Supplementary Fig. S5A). We examined protein levels of AR-V7, EZH2, and
total Src in tumor tissues using Western blot analysis. It was found
that these three miR-124 targets were signiﬁcantly downregulated
in miR-124 þ enzalutamide–treated tumors compared with
tumors treated with enzalutamide alone (Fig. 6A). Therefore,
combined repression of constitutively active AR variants and
downregulation of EZH2 and Src contribute to miR-124–mediated tumor inhibition. The observation of miR-124–induced
downregulation of these targets provides evidence that PEI nanoparticles can efﬁciently deliver miR-124 into prostate cancer
xenograft cells.
We previously observed that miR-124 downregulates miR125b in cultured prostate cancer cells (16). Herein, the expression
of miR-125b was measured by qPCR. Similarly, systemic administration of miR-124 induced a reduction of miR-125b abundance
in miR-124–treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Because
miR-125b targets p53 (22, 23), we evaluated the effects of miR124 on p53 level. As expected, a profound increase in p53 protein
was detected in miR-124–treated tumors (Fig. 6A). Having demonstrated that miR-124 inhibits the growth of prostate cancer
xenografts and upregulates p53, we next investigated whether
systemic administration of miR-124 induces apoptosis in the
mouse tumors. TUNEL staining was performed. Positive staining
was rare in tumors treated with miR-NC. Different extents of
TUNEL-positive areas were detected in tumors treated with enzalutamide and/or miR-124, particularly in combined treated
tumors, in which large TUNEL-positive areas were detected. The
nuclei of apoptotic cells are small and contain condensed and/or
fragmented chromatins. Representative results are shown
in Fig. 6B. Quantitative TUNEL assays demonstrated that the
combination of miR-124 and enzalutamide resulted in apoptosis
in 37% of the cell population, whereas the single-agent treatment
induced only 17% apoptosis (P < 0.05, Fig. 6B).

Discussion
Tumor-suppressive miR-124 is a highly conserved miRNA and
has been reported to be downregulated in various human cancers,

including cancers of the breast (24), liver (25), stomach (26),
colon (13), and kidney (27), as well as leukemia (28) and glioma
(29). This miRNA attracted our attention due to (i) its ability to
directly target the AR and subsequently induce downregulation of
miR-125b and upregulation of p53 and (ii) its signiﬁcantly
reduced expression levels in prostate cancer (16, 17). In this study,
we investigated the growth-inhibitory effects of miR-124 on a
variety of prostate cancer cell lines and xenograft tumors. Results
from in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that miR-124
signiﬁcantly inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells and sensitized prostate cancer cells to treatment with ARSIs. Moreover,
miR-124 can restore the response of 22Rv1-EnzR cells to enzalutamide. Combined administration of miR-124 and enzalutamide
induced increased apoptosis in tumor xenografts. These preclinical ﬁndings suggest that miR-124 plays an important role in
prostate cancer and can be exploited for adjuvant therapeutic
application.

Like most other miRNAs, prostate cancer–related targets of
miR-124 have not been validated experimentally. In our earlier
report, full-length AR was identiﬁed and conﬁrmed as a bona ﬁde
target of miR-124 (16). In the present study, EZH2 and Src were
validated as targets of miR-124. EZH2 functions not only as a
histone methyltransferase, silencing tumor suppressor genes and
antimetastatic genes (30), but also as an AR coactivator to support
prostate cancer growth (31). Overexpression of EZH2 is a common occurrence in prostate cancer and is associated with a poor
clinical outcome of patients with prostate cancer (32). Similarly,
Src is highly involved in prostate cancer, and inhibition of Src
activity inhibits prostate cancer tumor growth (33, 34). Thus, their
activities are required for the development of metastasis and
castration resistance of prostate cancer. Perhaps, the most striking
ﬁnding of this study is the detection of miR-124 target sites at the
30 UTRs of AR-V4 and AR-V7 transcripts. AR-V7 is the most studied
AR variant. Its expression was obviously enhanced in CRPC cells
due to intragenic AR gene rearrangement and altered RNA splicing
(35, 36). In this study, restoration of miR-124 level led to
signiﬁcant downregulation of AR-V7 protein in xenograft tumors.
The potential mechanisms for decreasing the levels of AR-V7
protein include: (i) miR-124 directly binds to the 30 UTR of
AR-V7, leading to degradation of AR-V7 mRNA and inhibition
of AR-V7 translation; (ii) miR-124 directly represses the full-length
AR (16), whereas AR-V7 RNA splicing is coupled with the fulllength AR gene transcription (35). Therefore, miR-124–induced
downregulation of the full-length AR accompanies a reduction of
AR-V7; and (iii) RNA splicing factor ASF that is a potential miR-124
target is speciﬁcally important for AR-V7 splicing (35). Taken
together, the ﬁnding that miR-124 mediates downregulation of at
least three oncoproteins relevant to prostate cancer progression and
therapy resistance provides a ﬁrm molecular foundation for using
miR-124 as novel adjunctive therapeutic agent.
Data presented in this study strongly suggest that miR-124
holds great promise as a therapeutic target. In our previous study,
lentivirally expressed miR-124 exhibited signiﬁcant growth inhibition of prostate cancer tumors (16). Although lentiviral vectors
are efﬁcient delivery agents, virus-based miRNA therapy may raise
serious safety problems related to toxicity and immunogenicity.
In this study, synthetic miR-124 mimics were used because they
have the same physical and chemical characters as endogenous
miR-124, which avoids many potential safety risks. Like other
nucleic acid–based therapies, a major challenge is encountered for
the delivery of miR-124 into prostate cancer cells. In this study, we
elected to use PEI-based delivery, which has a considerable
advantage over lentiviral-based vectors and has been widely
studied for gene delivery. The PEI nanoparticles, or "polyplexes,"
used in this study are composed of linear polymers that have
sufﬁcient stability, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and
higher biocompatibility (e.g., low toxicity relative to virus-based
vectors). Under physiologic conditions, PEI molecules are partially protonated and easily form complexes with miRNA. After
systemic injection, PEI–miRNA complexes interact with the
tumor cell surface and enter cells by endocytosis (37). Notably,
PEI increases internalization and facilitates the release of internalized miRNAs from endosomes due to a so-called "proton
sponge effect" (21). Our data obtained in animal experiments
demonstrated that PEI is able to efﬁciently deliver miR-124 to
prostate cancer xenografts, which is shown by PEI–miR-124
complex–induced antitumor effects and the inhibition of several
speciﬁc targets. Although PEI as a delivery agent still has

limitations (e.g., lower efﬁciency relative to virus-based vectors),
the observed antitumor effects and lack of unwanted side effects
suggest that this method of systemic delivery might be more
clinically relevant and worthwhile to pursue.
Treatment of advanced prostate cancer has proven extremely
challenging, especially in light of the fact that the newest ARSI
enzalutamide provides only a modest improvement in survival of
patients. Thus, while we search for new agents, improving
response to presently available agents could be beneﬁcial in
lowering mortality in this disease. Because one miRNA can target
multiple cancer-related genes or pathways, combined use of
miRNA and enzalutamide may represent a novel and viable
therapeutic strategy to prevent or delay recurrence of castration
resistance. Over the last several years, we have investigated the role
of miRNA in prostate cancer and discovered several miRNAs
(miR-124, miR-125b, miR-30, and let-7c) that contribute to the
AR signaling network. Using the data presented in this study
combined with those in our previous publications (23, 38–
41), an miR-124–regulated oncopathway is depicted in Fig. 7.
This oncopathway regulates several proapoptotic genes and oncogenes and miR-124 is a key regulator. In this study, we targeted this
oncopathway by using miR-124 and enzalutamide. Indeed, we
observed that combination treatment inhibited proliferation of
cultured CRPC cells in an additive manner and caused signiﬁcantly greater antitumor activity in mice, when compared with the
single treatment. Therefore, our results establish miR-124 as a
prostate cancer–relevant miRNA with the promise of being an
adjuvant therapeutic agent. Even so, the question can be asked,
what will be the mechanism of resistance of CRPC against miR124? One potential mechanism is through altering its AR-V
pattern. On the basis of the fact that AR-V12 is constituently
active in prostate cancer and that the 30 UTR in AR-V12 is different
from AR-V7 (42), it will be a prime target for bypassing miR-124.

Future studies to deﬁne the mechanism of resistance need to be
conducted.
In summary, we found that tumor-suppressive miR-124 is an
important modiﬁer of an oncopathway in prostate cancer that
regulates the expression of EZH2, Src, and AR variants that
contribute to pathogenesis and treatment resistance of prostate
cancer and that restoration of miR-124 inhibited the growth of
enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and sensitized these
cells to enzalutamide. Importantly, we observed that PEI-mediated systemic administration of synthetic miR-124 inhibited the
growth of androgen-dependent and -independent and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. Therefore, our data presented
in this study suggest that miR-124–based therapies have great
potential in the design of combination therapy for prostate cancer
treatment.
