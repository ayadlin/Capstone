BACKGROUND. Computational simulations have become powerful tools for understanding detailed interactions in biologic systems. To the authors’ knowledge to
date, the mechanism of imatinib resistance in BCR-ABL has not been clarified at
the atomic level, and computational studies are required.

METHODS. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the complex of imatinib
with the wild-type, T315I mutant, and 10 other P-loop mutants of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL were performed to study the mechanism of imatinib resistance.

reason for resistance for the P-loop mutations. Furthermore, in Y253H, protonation of the histidine at the e position, is essential for rendering this mutation resistant to imatinib.

hronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is triggered by the BCRABL oncoprotein, which contains a constitutively activated ABL
tyrosine kinase domain.1,2 Hence, inhibitors of the ABL domain can
be used to treat most chronic-phase CML.3
Imatinib is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL and currently is used to treat CML.4 Although imatinib is an effective inhibitor in most cases, mutations of BCR-ABL often show different
degrees of resistance to imatinib, especially the theronine to isoleucine mutation at position 315 (T315I) and the adenosine triphosphate phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) mutations.5–8 Patients who

have progressed to advanced-stage CML frequently
fail to respond or lose their response to therapy
because of imatinib resistance.5,9,10 Understanding of
the mechanism of imatinib resistance clearly is a
critical step toward imatinib modification or the
design of new inhibitors.11–14
There have been many significant analyses on
the crystal structure of the complex of imatinib and
the ABL domain.13,15–21 That structure provides very
valuable information for understanding the molecular basis of imatinib binding. However, the crystal
structure is an average structure and does not necessarily represent the true structure, especially when
the structure undergoes a rapid equilibrium within
few conformations. Furthermore, mutation-effect
analyses based on the static structure normally
ignore possible short- or long-range conformational
changes and do not include any dynamic effects
caused by thermal motions. Finally, the crystal structure, although it potentially is close to the structure
in vivo or in vitro, may differ significantly from the
true structure in certain regions, because the experimental conditions of a crystal structure differ greatly
from the real-life conditions.
Computational simulations can provide structural
details, energy landscape, dynamic behaviors, and
other properties that experiments either cannot provide or have difficulty offering. To our knowledge, few
computational simulations have been performed on
the problem of imatinib resistance, most likely because
of the size of the system. Monte Carlo simulations
reportedly have studied tyrosine kinase binding specificity and drug resistance.22 Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations23 have
proven useful for studying protein-ligand interactions.
A 0.4-ns MD simulation with cutoff models has been
reported24 and some insights of imatinib resistance
caused by T315I have been revealed. However, simulations with cutoff models are more valuable in a localized area and do not account for the structural
changes in larger areas that are common in flexible
molecules, such as kinases.
Here, we report the first large-scale MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations on the complex of
imatinib with the wild-type, T315I mutant, and other
10 P-loop mutants of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL.
Instead of cutoff models,24 we used full periodic
boundary conditions and full treatment of long-range
electrostatic interactions, and 30-ns simulations of
each mutant were performed to ensure proper sampling of data. To our knowledge, this work includes
by far the longest MD simulations conducted to date
on BCR-ABL, and we anticipate that it will be a

powerful technique for use in large, complex molecules such as kinases. Detailed mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been revealed through these sets
of full-scale simulations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Simulation Setup
The crystal structure of the complex of the kinase
domain of ABL and imatinib was used as the initial
structure (PDB code 1IEP).25 All crystal water molecules were removed, and missing hydrogen atoms of
the protein and imatinib were added. Then, the complex was put into a 60 3 80 3 60 cubic angstroms
water box with TIP3P water molecules.26 Sodium/
chloride ions were added to reach the physiologic
concentration of sodium ions (0.14 M) and overall
electric neutrality. The resulting system contained
36,123 atoms (ABL, 4441 atoms; imatinib, 68 atoms;
water, 31,674 atoms; Na1, 18 atoms; Cl2, 9 atoms).
All preparation steps were performed using the
VMD software package (version 1.8.6; available at:
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/ Accessed on
August 1, 2007).27
Missing charge parameters for imatinib were
obtained by using the restrained electrostatic chargefitting (RESP)28 procedure with the imatinib structure
(initially taken from the complex) fully optimized at a
restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF)/6–3111 level by using
the Gaussian03 package29 and the with electrostatic
potential from an RHF/6–3111 single-point calculation. Other missing parameters were transferred from
similar atom types. All MD simulations were performed using the NAMD package (version 2.6)30 with
the CHARMM27 force field.31 Default parameters
and settings were used except as specified below. Periodic boundary conditions were used along with the
isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT) at 1 atmosphere
and 298 K. The smooth particle mesh Ewald (PME)
method32 was used with 60, 80, and 60 Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) grid points for the lattice directions x,
y, and z, respectively. A cutoff of 12 Å for nonbonded
interactions was used with switching van der Waals
(vdW) potential beginning at 10 Å with the SHAKE
algorithm33 applied to bonds that involved hydrogens.
The following procedure was used before the
data collection (production) MD simulations. First,
all atoms of the protein complex were restrained at
their crystal structure positions with a force constant
of 50 kcal/mol/Å2. Next, water and ion molecules
were energy-optimized, and they underwent the following simulated annealing: The temperature was
increased from 0 kelvin (K) to 600 K (1 K per picosecond [ps]), was kept at 600 K for 500 ps, then was

decreased from 600 K to 300 K at 21 K per ps, and
was kept at 300 K for 500 ps. Then, the system was
kept at 300 K for 4 ns. The same procedure was
repeated again and resulted in an equilibration simulation of 10 ns for water molecules and ions.
The water/ion-equilibrated system then was used
as the starting point for the production simulations.
Mutant systems were created by using the VMD package27 based on this water/ion-equilibrated system.
One or 2 nearby cations/anions were removed to
allow mutants that involved charge changes to reach
electric neutrality with an additional 1 ns for equilibration of waters and ions. Then, the restraint force
constant gradually was reduced to 3 kcal/mol/Å2 during a 500-ps period followed by 2000 energy-minimization steps for all atoms and then a 300 ps of
heating period with the temperature increased from
0 K to 300 K (1 K per ps).
In the production run, for each mutant, a 20-ns
MD simulation was performed without any restraining potential applied. The last 15 ns of data were
used for data analysis.

Relative Binding Free Energy Analysis
The MM-PBSA approach23,34 was used to analyze
differences in the relative binding free energy,
DDGbinding, to wild-type. It can be broken as
follows: DDGbinding 5 DEelectrostatic 1 DEvdW 1 DDGPB
1 D DGnonpolar, where DEelectrostatic is the electrostatic
contribution, DEvdW is the vdW contribution, DDGPB
is the polar solvation contribution, and DDGnonpolar is
the nonpolar contribution. Those terms were calculated by using the PBEQ module of the CHARMM
package (version 32b1).35

RESULTS
MD Simulation Results
MD simulations for wild-type and 11 mutants of the
ABL domain complex with imatinib were performed
with 10-ns equilibration of waters and ions, 5-ns
equilibration of the whole system, and 15 ns of data
collection for each mutant, as described above (see
Materials and Methods). The 11 mutants were
E255K, E255V, G250E, L248V, M244V, Q252H,
Q252Hp, T315I, Y253F, Y253H, and Y253Hp, where H
denotes the histidine residue protonated at the d
position and Hp denotes the histidine residue protonated at both the d and e positions, resulting in a
positively charged histidine. Except for T315I, all
mutations were in the P-loop region, defined as residues 244 through 255.36
Figure 1 shows the root mean square deviation
(RMSD) of the active site for 4 selected mutants dur-

ing production simulations. Other mutants exhibited
similar curves and, hence, are not shown. The RMSD
is an indicator of the stability of MD simulations.
The analyses indicated that the simulations were
stable after 5 ns. The average RMSD was approximately 1.5 Å to 2 Å and remained stable after 5 ns.
The RMSD results suggested that at least a few nanoseconds of equilibration are necessary to study this
system.

Relative Binding Free Energy Analysis
Table 1 lists the calculated and experimental values
of relative binding free energy between imatinib and
mutated ABL (DDGbind) (related to the wild-type).
The values were calculated by using the MM-PBSA
approach, and each entry represents the average
values for 15,000 data points from a 15-ns production MD trajectory with 1 ps sampling frequency.
The experimental values are not very consistent,
because the experimental conditions may differ
widely. The calculated values, however, agree qualitatively with the experimental trends. T315I clearly had
very strong imatinib resistance, because it had the
largest DDGbind value, and Q252H suggested weaker
imatinib resistance compared with the other mutations between those 2 extremes.
The contributions to the relative binding free
energies from P-loop residues and other residues also
are listed in Table 1. The mutations studied here,
except T315I, are all P-loop mutations. The contributions to DDGbind, however, are very different for each
mutation. Previous research suggests that the P-loop
mutations contribute to the major cases of imatinib
resistance,36 because the mutations either decrease

direct contact between imatinib and the P-loop or
distort the P-loop conformation.7 By examining the
contribution of DDGbind from P-loop residues to
mutations in P-loop, only E255K, E255V, Q252H,
Q252Hp, and Y253Hp made contributions >1.0 kcal/
mol from the P-loop. The residues at 252 and 255 did
not directly contact imatinib. The mutation L248V,
which occurs at the point of direct contact with imatinib, received only 0.87 kcal/mol from the P-loop.
To understand the binding changes more deeply,
we broke down the contributions to the interaction
between imatinib and the P-loop further into the
electrostatic and vdW parts and into each residue.
The electrostatic part represents the classic longrange columbic interaction, including charge-charge
and other multipole interactions. The vdW part is the
‘‘contact energy.’’ These 2 terms represent the major
part of nonbonding interactions in MD simulations.
For all entries, a positive value indicates a reduction
in binding energy, because negative binding energy
indicates that the binding is stronger.
Table 2 shows the detailed mutation effect on
each P-loop residue for all mutations that we studied. E255K reduced (ie, increased to a more positive
value) the electrostatic interaction for residue 255.
E255V had a similar but smaller effect, and E255V
also affected the binding-free energy contribution for
residue 253, suggesting that E255V changes the local
conformation and influences the interaction between
other residues (253) and imatinib.

Table 2 shows that only G250E had a net
increase in electrostatic contribution at residue 250.
Residue 248 and 253 were the only 2 residues that
contacted imatinib directly.
L248V had a 0.48 kcal/mol decrease in vdW,
which means that the contact with imatinib was decreased. However, this vdW contribution accounted
for only part of the effect on the P-loop, because
L248V made a net contribution of only 0.87 kcal/mol
to all P-loop residues (Table 1). The remaining contribution came from other residues, suggesting that
L248V also causes a small conformation change of
the whole P-loop.
Surprisingly, M244V had very little effect on Ploop residues, along with T315I, Y253F, and Y253H.
Y253F only caused small changes in vdW at residue
253, consistent with biochemical intuition. Y253H
caused significant changes in both electrostatic and
vdW interactions, although the changes were in different directions and they roughly cancelled each
other. Conversely, Y253Hp affected binding significantly.
To briefly summarize Table 2, a ‘‘negative-topositive’’ or ‘‘negative-to-neutral’’ change weakened
the binding, suggesting that there may be a strong
dipole moment at the P-loop binding head of the
imatinib molecule that prefers a negatively charged
environment in the P-loop. Decreasing this electrostatic interaction is one of the major reasons for imatinib resistance by E255K(V), Q252Hp, and Y253Hp,

whereas the effect of L248V is caused mainly by the
changes in imatinib contacts.
The changes in the interactions between P-loop
residues and imatinib apparently do not account for
all mutation effects. The same analysis was performed on other residues, and selected results, which
are the residues with relative binding free energy
changes >0.20 kcal/mol because of mutation, are
listed in Table 3.
Table 3 shows that almost every mutation had a
significant effect on the interactions between imatinib and E286 and M290. E286 and M290 are located
at the C-helix, which is near the ligand entrance.
Both the epsilon oxygen (Oe) of E286 and the sulfur
(S) of M290 could form a hydrogen bond to N21,
which is considered one of the anchor points of imatinib.22 Apparently, the C-helix is flexible enough so

that every mutation changes its position relative to
imatinib. However, the effects on E286 and M290
appeared to be in different directions, and the net
effects were not significant for most mutations, ie,
when the interaction from 1 residue increased, the
interaction from the other residue decreased. To verify the importance of these 2 residues, selected simulation results of E286K and M290L also are listed in
Table 3 and indicate that the electrostatic interaction
was decreased significantly in E286K and moderately
in M290L, consistent with previous experimental
observations.13,37
Conversely, Table 3 also demonstrates that T315I
reduced the interactions from both E286 and M290;
in fact, this was the main reason for the strong effect
of T315I, contradicting prior suggestions that the loss
of hydrogen bond between T315I and imatinib is the
main reason for the T315I mutation effect.15,38 The
positions of E286 and M290 relative to imatinib
changed significantly. According to our results, T315I
does cause the loss of hydrogen bond between
T(I)35I and imatinib (in the form of electrostatic
energy), but it also increases the contact energy (in
the form of vdW); thus, the overall effect on the
interaction between T(I)315 and imatinib actually is
tighter binding upon T315I mutation. The conformational change of the C-helix, resulting in significantly
reduced interaction contributions from E286 and
M290 (Figs. 2, 3), causes the imatinib resistance of
T315I. These results are consistent with a smaller
scale MD study.24 In fact, equivalent mutations were
identified in other kinases that caused significant
conformational changes, eg, T338I (T315I equivalent
here) in c-Src.39,40
P-loop mutations also affect the contribution
from F382, which is at the other side of imatinib
from the P-loop. This implies that P-loop mutations
do cause a shifting in the position of imatinib,
although the shift may not be very significant,
because only has a significant impact on the contribution from F382.
E255V has a broader impact on interactions
from various residues, suggesting that E255V may
cause a greater conformational change. Compared
with E255K, although E255V has a smaller impact
on the electrostatic contribution from P-loop residues, the overall effect from E255V is greater than
that from E255K, clearly because of the larger

do not affect the binding between imatinib and the
P-loop, as suggested reviously.7 Rather, they change
the relative position of imatinib to other residues
and, hence. the interactions between them.

PBSA Analysis
The PBSA contribution can be considered the effect
of the solvent/ion responding to ABL and imatinib
conformational changes. It is not possible to break
down PBSA contributions to the atomic level. Nevertheless, the PBSA contribution can be used as an indicator of the global conformational change of ABL
because of mutations. Table 1 clearly shows the relative magnitude of conformational changes because
of various mutations.
Q252H and Q252Hp had quite different effects on
each residue, although the overall effects were similar
despite our lack of knowledge of the protonation state
of the histidine residue. Conversely, Y253Hp had a

much greater effect compared with Y253H. Experimental data41,42 suggest that Y253H has large imatinib resistance and, thus, that Y253Hp may be the
right form of mutation (ie, the histidine is likely to be
double-protonated and positively charged). The estimated pKa of H253 in Y253H is 5.32, and the pKa of
H252 in Q252H is 7.07 according to the PROPKA
server (available at: http://propka.ki.ku.dk/ Accessed
on August 1, 2007) and based on the snapshot structures at 20 ns.

Result Summary
In summary, our simulations and PBSA results indicated that the unfavorable electrostatic interaction
between the P-loop and imatinib, except for mutations of the direct contact residues (such as L248 and
Y253), was the main reason for imatinib resistance in
the P-loop mutations that involved ‘‘negative-to-positive’’ or ‘‘negative-to-neutral’’ charge changes. Other

the 15-nanosecond time stamp of molecular dynamics simulations. T315I clearly changed the overall binding conformation of imatinib and, hence, the binding
free energy.

P-loop mutations caused the conformational changes
and reduced the interaction between imatinib and
non-P-loop residues.
For T315I, our results suggest that the effect of
the T315I mutation comes mainly from the change
of the C-helix conformation. More specifically, the
main effect comes from the impact on the interactions between imatinib and E286 and M290.

DISCUSSION
Shah et al.7 have proposed the possible mechanism
of imatinib resistance for various mutations in the Ploop. Our results are not very consistent with their
suggestions. Intuitive analyses based on static structures are useful but also are limited. It would be
impossible to draw the same conclusions as our
simulation results based only on any simple, static

BCR-ABL Imatinib Resistance Simulation/Lee et al.

FIGURE 3. Representative schematic views of wild-type structures (top)
and T315I structures (bottom) from snapshots at the 15-nanosecond time
stamp of molecular dynamics simulations. T315I clearly changed the conformation of the C-helix in which glutamate 286 (GLU286) and methionine 290
(MET290) reside. The ‘‘head’’ of the C-helix moves away from the imatinib
molecule. Imatinib is shown in yellow.

structure models. Simple computational models,
although they may be useful for very small conformational changes,38,43,44 cannot provide a detailed
description of dynamic behaviors and cannot predict
realistic conformational changes.
According to our simulations, T315I leads to significant conformational changes, as demonstrated
previously39,40: hence the binding affinity between
imatinib and the ABL domain. When the imatinib
molecule was aligned for the wild-type and for
T315I, the RMSD of the C-helix was approximately
3.5 Å between 2 simulations. More specifically, E286
and M290 were the main source of the reduction in
binding-free energy (Table 3).
A similar rationale also may be applied to 2 new
drugs, nilotinib45 and dasatinib,46 in which T315I
also exhibits strong drug resistance. Weisberg et al.
demonstrated47 that nilotinib has close contact with
E286, similar to imatinib. The position change of
E286 due to T315I may be the reason for nilotinib resistance, as reported by von Bubnoff et al.48

1751

Dasatinib does not seem to interact directly with
E286; however, T315I still causes dasatinib resistance.47 A possible explanation is that, in the case of
dasatinib, E286 is not interacting with the inhibitor,
but some conformational changes due to T315I
will be expected and will break some interactions
between dasatinib and the surrounding residues; or,
as suggested by Levinson et al.,40 the resistance to
dasatinib most likely is because of the effects of
T315I on E286 and prevents the formation of an
active Src site. Large-scale simulations of the dasatinib/ABL complex may provide a clearer picture.
Compared with the pioneering MD simulations
by Pricl et al.,24 our simulations used the full periodic
boundary conditions and included every water molecule in a large water box instead of a cutoff on the
boundary and an only 30-Å water cap. The conclusions of Pricl et al. were consistent with our findings
of a strong contribution from E286 for the T315I
mutation, which suggests that their simulations may
be enough for studying immediately nearby residues.
However, M290 was not a strong contributor,
whereas K271, R362, and D381 made strong contributions in their results, which are not consistent
with ours (K271, R362, and D381 are not listed in
our Tables here because of their small contributions).
A possible explanation is that the system may require
at least a few nanoseconds of equilibration (Fig. 1)
before it reaches a well equilibrated state in which
key residues are rearranged in response to the mutation effect. In addition, the movements of far residues
may require noncutoff simulations. Furthermore, with
a total simulation time of 30 ns and 15 ns of data
analysis, the errors in our simulations should be from
0.5 to 1 order smaller than the errors in the report by
Pricl et al. (<1 ns of total simulation and 0.4 ns of
data analysis). Thus, the work reported here represents a major step forward for simulations of the
ABL/imatinib system.
Although the calculated relative changes in binding free energy agreed with experimental data qualitatively (Table 1), some results were not consistent. It
was believed that M244V caused only weak imatinib
resistance; however, the current calculated relative
change in binding free energy was 4.62 kcal/mol.
The large deviation may have several causes: More
accurate estimates of the changes in binding free
energy should consider the equilibrium between the
active and inactive conformations for each mutant,
like some recently reported Monte Carlo simulations.22 In the current study, only simulation results
of the inactive form are reported, which may not
have captured realistic binding changes. Simulations
that start with different possible conformations40

may lead to a better understanding of this system. In
addition, the SH2/SH3 domains were not included in
our study, because we assumed that the domain-domain interfaces were far from the imatinib binding
site and that the effect would be small. However,
that assumption may be not valid in some cases and
should be verified. Finally, more accurate MD parameters for this system should be developed based on
well chosen mutations to establish quantitative
assessments of MD simulations in this system.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, we have presented the first full-scale MD simulations on the problem of imatinib resistance for the BCR-ABL system,
and the mechanisms of imatinib resistance of some
mutants at the atomic level were revealed. We expect
that, as computational tools become more and more
powerful, more realistic simulations of the ABL/imatinib system, along with other potential drugs, and a
detailed understanding of their interactions will
become plausible in the very near future.
