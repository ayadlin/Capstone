ABSTRACT
Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular cancer in children, affecting
1/20,000 live births. Currently, children with retinoblastoma were treated with
chemotherapy using drugs such as carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide.
Unfortunately, if conventional treatment fails, the affected eyes should be removed to
prevent extension into adjacent tissues and metastasis. This study is to investigate the
roles of L1 in adhesion-mediated proliferation and chemoresistance of retinoblastoma.
L1 was differentially expressed in 30 retinoblastoma tissues and 2 retinoblastoma cell
lines. Furthermore, the proportions of L1-positive cells in retinoblastoma tumors were
negatively linked with the number of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, a characteristic
of differentiated retinoblastoma tumors, in each tumor sample. Following in vitro
experiments using L1-deleted and -overexpressing cells showed that L1 increased
adhesion-mediated proliferation of retinoblastoma cells via regulation of cell cycleassociated proteins with modulation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and
p38 pathways. In addition, L1 increased resistance against carboplatin, vincristine,
and esoposide through up-regulation of apoptosis- and multidrug resistance-related
genes. In vivo tumor formation and chemoresistance were also positively linked with
the levels of L1 in an orthotopic transplantation model in mice. In this manner, L1
increases adhesion-mediated proliferation and chemoresistance of retinoblastoma.
Targeted therapy to L1 might be effective in the treatment of retinoblastoma tumors,
especially which rapidly proliferate and demonstrate resistance to conventional
chemotherapeutic drugs.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

The mainstay treatment options against
retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular malignant
tumor in children, are chemotherapy and focal therapies
[1, 2]. Currently, drug regimens include a combination
of carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide for intravenous
administration and melphalan or topotecan for intraarterial
administration [3]. If these treatment options fail
to manage intraocular tumors, the affected eyes are
enucleated to minimize the possibility of extraocular
extension and metastasis to other vital organs, including
the brain.
Retinoblastoma tumors exhibit varying degrees of
differentiation with heterogenous distribution of rosettes,
including Homer Wright and Flexner-Wintersteiner
rosettes [4, 5]. Retinoblastoma cells which constitute
Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes retain features of primordial
photoreceptor cells [4–7]. However, as in other cancers,
with the progression of retinoblastoma, retinoblastoma
cells lose their ability to differentiate [8, 9] and there was a
significant inverse relationship between age at enucleation
and the degree of tumor differentiation, demonstrated by
the presence of rosettes [6].
L1, a transmembrane glycoprotein, was primarily
identified as an adhesion molecule which plays a role in
the migration of neuronal cells [10]. Recent studies have
demonstrated that L1 is also expressed in several cancers
including glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumor [11–15]. In particular, L1 is often
linked with poorly differentiated tumors and regarded
as poor prognostic factors [13, 16–18]. With homophilic
or heterophilic interaction, L1 triggers various signaling
pathways [19], resulting in proliferation, migration,
invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance of cancer cells
[15, 20–24].
In this study, the roles of L1, which was
differentially expressed in human retinoblastoma cells
and tumors, were investigated in adhesion-mediated
proliferation and chemoresistance of retinoblastoma,
using L1-depleted or L1-overexpressing retinoblastoma
cell lines and an established orthotopic transplantation
model in mice. L1 depletion downregulated the activation
of down-stream signaling molecules in phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways, resulting in decreased growth
and increased susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs.
These phenomena might be related with the differential
expression of proteins and genes associated with cell
cycle, apoptosis, and multi-drug resistance (MDR) by
L1. L1 overexpression induced the opposite biological
activities in retinoblastoma cells. From these results, we
suggest that L1 could be a valuable therapeutic target
for retinoblastoma, especially which demonstrates rapid
proliferation and resistance to conventional drugs.

L1 is differentially expressed in retinoblastoma
tissues and cells

As summarized in Supplementary Table 1, 30
retinoblastoma tumors included in this study were
representative of advanced retinoblastoma in Group D or E
according to International Classification of Retinoblastoma
[25] and Group 5A or 5B according to Reese-Ellsworth
classification [26]. Immunohistochemical analyses showed
that 26 samples (87%) were L1-positive (Figure 1A and
Table 1). The mean proportions of L1-positive cells in
positive samples were 25% (Table 1). L1 was also found
to be differently expressed in two different retinoblastoma
cell lines, Y79 and SNUOT-Rb1 cells (Figure 1B).
L1 is expressed as a neuronal or non-neuronal splicing
isoform that demonstrates specific tissue distribution [27–
29]. The neuronal isoform of L1 contains exons 2 and 27,
whereas the non-neuronal isoform, which is known to be
expressed in cancers [30], lacks residues encoded by exons
2 and 27 due to alternative splicing [31–33]. Reverse
transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses
using specific primers to the exon 2 or 27 showed that L1
which was expressed in Y79 cells was the neuronal isoform
containing exons 2 and 27 (Figure 1C). The depletion of
Slug, the transcription factor of L1 [34, 35] and increased
in retinoblastoma protein-depleted cells [36], decreased the
expression of L1 in Y79 cells (Figure 1D and 1E).
To figure out the relation between L1 expression and
tumor characteristics, correlation analyses were performed
between the proportion of L1-positive cells and the
number of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes (Figure 1F), a
morphological marker of differentiated retinoblastoma [5,
6], in each tissue sample. Interestingly, there was a definite
negative correlation between these 2 features (Figure 1G;
Pearson’s coefficient = -0.493, P-value = 0.006).

L1 increases adhesion-mediated proliferation of
retinoblastoma
To investigate the role of L1 in retinoblastoma, stable
retinoblastoma cell lines were established with depletion or
overexpression of L1 by lentivirus-mediated transduction
of an L1-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or an
expression vector for full-length human L1, respectively.
As shown in Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 1A,
L1-depleted Y79 cells failed to form cohesive clusters
compared to naïve Y79 cells which are characterized
by cluster formation in proliferation. In contrast, L1overexpressing SNUOT-Rb1 cells showed higher
cohesiveness compared to naïve SNUOT-Rb1 cells (Figure
2B and Supplementary Figure 1B). Next, to determine
the effects of L1 on the proliferation of retinoblastoma
cells, the proliferation assays were performed by direct

cell counting. L1 depletion significantly decreased the
proliferation of retinoblastoma cells in varying serum
concentrations (Supplementary Figure 1C) and time points
(Figure 2C). In contrast, L1 overexpression increased
anchorage-independent growth, as determined by the
number and size of colonies in a soft agar assay (Figure
2D, 2E, and Supplementary Figure 1D).
To confirm the effects of L1 on the proliferation of
retinoblastoma cells, Y79 cells were synchronized and the
cell cycle distribution was examined by flow cytometry
analyses. As shown in Figure 2F, L1 depletion induced
the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase and subsequent
reduction in the entry into the S phase. In accordance
with these results, the expression of cyclin D1, E, and
A was markedly reduced and that of cell cycle inhibitor
p21 and p27 was increased in L1-depleted Y79 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1E).

Recent studies have demonstrated that L1 activates
intracellular signaling pathways, including PI3K and MAPK
pathways, to induce proliferation, invasion, and metastasis
of tumor cells [19–22, 37, 38]. In retinoblastoma cells, L1
downregulation resulted in decreased phosphorylation of
Akt, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), and p38
(Figure 2G), while L1 overexpression induced the increase
in activation of these pathways (Figure 2H).
Then, the effects of L1 depletion on in vivo tumor
formation were investigated with a well-established
orthotopic transplantation model in mice. Naïve and L1depleted Y79 cells (5 x 104 cells) were injected into the
vitreous cavity of Balb/c nude mice and the degrees of tumor
formation were evaluated according to the visual grading
system at 4 weeks after the injection (Supplementary Figure
2). Naïve Y79 cells effectively formed tumors in the vitreous
cavity (Figure 2I). In contrast, L1-depleted Y79 cells failed

cells [15, 23, 24, 39]. In this context, the relation was
investigated between the L1 levels and chemoresistance
to carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide. L1 depletion
in Y79 cells significantly decreased cell viability upon
the treatment with carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide
(Figure 3A), while L1 overexpression in SNUOT-Rb1
cells increased resistance to these drugs (Figure 3B).
A variety of mechanisms involved in the resistance
of cancer cells to chemotherapy include proteins related
with apoptosis and MDR [40–42]. To screen which
proteins were related with L1-mediated chemoresistance in

retinoblastoma, the relative levels of 35 apoptosis-related
proteins were analyzed using a protein array in control
and L1-depleted Y79 cells. As shown in Figure 3C, proapoptotic proteins, cleaved caspase-3 and cytochrome c,
were markedly increased, whereas anti-apoptotic proteins,
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and pro-caspase-3, were reduced in L1depleted Y79 cells. In accordance with these data, L1
depletion downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and BclxL and upregulated the expression of cleaved caspase-3
and cytochrome c upon the treatment of carboplatin,
vincristine, or etoposide (Figure 3D).
Next, to investigate whether MDR is involved in
L1-mediated chemoresistance of retinoblastoma, the

expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
were examined in L1-depleted or -overexpressing
retinoblastoma cells by RT-PCR and quantitative realtime-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses. The expression levels
of ABC transporters including ABCA1, ABCB1, ABCC2,
and ABCG2 were significantly downregulated in L1depleted Y79 cells compared to naïve Y79 cells (Figure
4A and Supplementary Figure 3A), whereas those were
upregulated in L1-overexpressing SNUOT-Rb1 cells
compared to naïve cells (Figure 4B and Supplementary
Figure 3B). Consistent with these findings, L1 depletion
significantly decreased drug efflux in Y79 cells,
comparable to the treatment with MDR inhibitors

L1 increases in vivo chemoresistance

including verapamil, MK-571, and novobiocin (Figure
4C). In contrast, L1 overexpression upregulated drug
efflux in SNUOT-Rb1 cells (Figure 4D).
Several reports have demonstrated that PI3K and
MAPK signaling pathways regulate MDR [43–45]. In
this context, the expression of ABC transporters was
examined with the modulation of Akt, ERK, and p38
pathway in Y79 cells (Figure 4E). As shown in Figure
4E, Akt, ERK, and p38 pathway inhibitors significantly
down-regulated the expression of ABC transporters in
retinoblastoma cells. Together, these results strongly
demonstrated that L1 increased chemoresistance in
retinoblastoma.

Next, to further confirm the effect of L1 on
chemoresistance of retinoblastoma in vivo, control and
L1-overexpressed SNUOT-Rb1 cells (2 x 104 cells) were
injected into the vitreous cavity of mice and the mice
were treated with carboplatin via intraperitoneal injection
3 times a week from 2 weeks after intravitreal injection
of tumor cells, when the tumor formation was evident.
Despite vigorous chemotherapy, L1-overexpressing cells
formed more mass- (Grade 3) or plaque-like (Grade 2)
tumors than control cells (Figure 5A; Fisher’s exact test,
P-value = 0.019). Interestingly, carboplatin-resistant
Y79 cells also demonstrated increased L1 expression

(Figure 5B). To verify these data using human tumor
samples, we performed immunohistochemical analyses
in chemoresistant retinoblastoma tumors from 4 patients
who underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy
(Supplementary Table 2). As demonstrated in Figure 5C,
chemoresistant tumors demonstrated diffuse cytoplasmic
and membranous expression of L1 throughout the tumors.

these features indicate that retinoblastoma cells retain the
characteristics of differentiated retinal constituent cells.
In this study, L1 was differentially expressed in
retinoblastoma cells and tissues. In 26 (87%) out of 30
human retinoblastoma tumor samples, L1-positive cells
were observed with the mean proportions of 25%. Similarly
to the differential expression in retinoblastoma tissues, Y79
cells showed higher expression of L1, whereas SNUOTRb1 cells lacked expression of L1. Our results also revealed
that L1 expressed in Y79 cells was the neuronal isoform
containing the neuron-specific exon 2 (YEGHH) and 27
(RSLE) motifs, not the non-neuronal isoform, which is socalled tumor-associated variant [30], lacking both exons
(Figure 1D). The L1 variant lacking YEGHH, located at the
N-terminus, exhibits significantly reduced hemophilic and
heterophilic binding and neurite outgrowth activity [51]. On
the other hand, RSLE in the cytoplasmic domain induces the
internalization of L1 via clathrin-coated pits [52].
To figure out the meaning of differential expression
of L1 in the context of differentiation in retinoblastoma,
correlation analyses were performed on the relationship
between the proportion of L1-positive cells and the
number of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes. Interestingly,

DISCUSSION
Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular
malignant tumor in children, affecting 1 in 20,000 live
births [1, 2, 46, 47]. In the progression of retinoblastoma,
retinoblastoma tumors lose their characteristics of
differentiated retinal cells [8, 9]. Retinoblastoma tumors
from patients who underwent enucleation at older
age demonstrate fewer Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes
which represent differentiated retinoblastoma tumors
[6]. Electron microscopy studies demonstrate that
retinoblastoma cells in Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes
possess cilia, which are thought to be the precursor of
photoreceptor outer segments [4, 7]. Although the cell of
origin of retinoblastoma is yet to be established [48–50],

there was a definite inverse relationship between these 2
features, indicating that L1 might be related with loss of
differentiation in retinoblastoma. This finding was in line
with previous reports on the expression of L1 in poorly
differentiated cancers in other organs [13, 17]. Furthermore,
in 4 human retinoblastoma tumor samples from patients
who underwent enucleation despite multiple cycles of
intravenous chemotherapy, diffuse L1 expression was
observed, supporting the role of L1 in the chemoresistance
of retinoblastoma. In addition, retinoblastoma tumors, both
naïve and chemoresistant tumors, demonstrated mixed
cytosolic and membranous expression of L1. These mixed
patterns implied that L1 activated intracellular signaling by
internalization in retinoblastoma [22], not just remained as
an adhesion molecule.
From the functional analyses of L1 in
retinoblastoma, L1 depletion induced deactivation of Akt,
ERK, and p38 in Y79 cells, whereas L1 overexpression
increased phosphorylation of them in SNUOT-Rb1 cells.
Both PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways are downstream
signaling cascades of L1 activation in various cancers [20–
22, 37, 38]. Furthermore, modulation of these pathways
by L1 were linked with differential expression of cell
cycle-, apoptosis-, and MDR-related molecules, affecting
proliferation and chemoresistance of retinoblastoma.
In conclusion, L1, differentially expressed in
retinoblastoma cells and tumors, increases proliferation
and chemoresistance of retinoblastoma through the
modulation of intracellular signaling cascades, PI3K/Akt
and MAPK pathways. Our results support that targeting L1
might provide a new therapeutic strategy that is effective in
the treatment of retinoblastoma tumors which differentially
express L1 and are resistant to conventional drugs.

Y79 cells (ATCC) and SNUOT-Rb1 cells [53]
were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Thermo) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in the humidified atmosphere
of 95% air and 5% CO2.

Chemicals
Carboplatin (cat. no. C2538, Sigma), vincristine
(cat. no. V8879, Sigma), and etoposide (cat. no. E1383,
Sigma) were diluted to indicated concentrations with
distilled water (carboplatin), methanol (vincristine), or
DMSO (etoposide) for further experiments.

Immunohistochemistry
From paraffin blocks of enucleated eyes from 30
patients, sagittal sections were prepared at 4 μm thickness.
The sections were incubated at 60°C for 2 hours and then
deparaffinized and hydrated by sequential immersion in
Xylene Substitute (Thermo) and graded ethyl alcohol
solutions. Antigen retrieval was performed by the treatment
with 0.1M sodium citrate (pH 6.8, Sigma) at 120°C for
10 minutes. The sections were permeabilized with 0.2%
Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then,
to minimize nonspecific binding, the sections were treated
with 1X Universal Blocking Reagent (Biogenex) for
10 minutes. After incubation with the primary antibody
against L1 (1:5000; cat. no. ab24345, abcam) overnight,
the sections were treated with REAL™ Detection Systems
(Dako) and DAB Kit (Life Technologies) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the sections were
mounted with Permount solution (Thermo) and observed
under the light microscope (Nikon). The percentage of
L1-positive cells in tumor sections were evaluated by
an experienced pathologist (Y.H. Kim) and confirmed
by another independent observer (D.H. Jo). In addition,
the number of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes in tumor
samples were estimated from direct counting throughout
the whole tumor sections.

RT-PCR and qRT-PCR

Depletion and overexpression of L1

Total RNA was isolated from retinoblastoma cells
using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche). Target
RNA was converted to cDNA by treatment with 200
units of reverse transcriptase and 500 ng of oligo(dT)
primer in 50 mM Tris- HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM dNTPs at 42°C
for 1 hour. The reaction was quenched by heating at 70°C
for 15 minutes. One microliter of the cDNA mixture was
amplified with 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3),
1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2.5 units of Taq DNA
polymerase, and 0.1 μM of each primer. The primers used
were 5’-GAGACCTTCGGCGAGTACAG-3’ (forward) and
5’-CTATTCTAGGGCCACGGCAG-3’ (reverse) for whole
L1; 5’-ATATGAAGGACACCATGTGA-3’ (forward) and
5’-GCAAAGCAGCGGTAGATGCC-3’ (reverse) for exon
2 of L1; 5’-TACAGGTCCCTGGAGAGT-3’ (forward) and
5’-GGCCCCTGAGCTGTCATT-3’ (revserse) for exon 27
of L1; 5’-TTCCACGCCCAGCTACCCAA-3’ (forward)
and 5’-TGGCATGGGGGTCTGAAAGC-3’ (reverse) for
SLUG; 5’-ATGAGCCGGTCAATGCCCCT-3’ (forward)
and 5’-TAGCAGGCCAGCGCTCACAA-3’ (reverse) for
ABCA1; 5’-TGGTGGCCAGAAACAACGCA-3’ (forward)
and 5’-TCACAATGCAGGTGCGGCCT-3’ (reverse) for
ABCB1; 5’-TGTCCATCCACTGTTTCAAT-3’ (forward)
and 5’-AGTTTGGTGGTAGAGGATCT-3’ (reverse) for
ABCC2; 5’-TCCGTGGTGTGTCTGGAGGA-3’ (forward)
and 5’-TGAGCAGGCCCGTGGAACAT-3’ (reverse) for
ABCG2; 5’-ACACGTTGGCAGTGGGGACA-3’ (forward)
and 5’-TGCCTCCTGCACCACCAACT-3’ (reverse) for
GAPDH. The PCR conditions were as follows: the first
denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes plus 30 cycles of 30
seconds of denaturation at 94°C, 30 seconds of annealing
at 50°C, and 30 seconds of elongation at 72°C and a final

L1-specific and non-target shRNA encoded in
pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Sigma) and full-length human
L1 (neuronal isoform) subcloned into a pLVX-EF1αIRES-Puro lentiviral vector (Clontech) were utilized for
depletion and overexpression of L1, respectively. We
utilized the neuronal isoform of L1 as a template because
Y79 cells expressed neuronal one. To generate stable
transfectants, the lentiviral vector was co-transfected
into Lenti-293T cells (Clontech) with virus packing mix
(Sigma) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The virus was added to
Y79 cells or SNUOT-Rb1 cells with 5 μg/mL polybrene
(Santa Cruz). After 20 hours, media were removed
and replaced with fresh media containing 3 μg/mL of
puromycin (Santa Cruz). Puromycin-resistant clones were
selected by incubating cells in the puromycin-containing
media for 2 weeks. L1 expression was analyzed using RTPCR and Western blot analyses.

Proliferation assay
Y79 cells (1 X 104 cells) were seeded in 6-well
dishes in the RPMI-1640 media. After 72 hours, viable
cells were counted with a hemocytometer in triplicates.

Flow cytometry
Y79 cells (1 X 105 cells) were seeded in 60-mm
dishes in the RPMI-1640 media containing 5% FBS. After
24 hours, the cells were harvested and fixed with cold
ethanol for 30 minutes. Then, the cells were dehydrated
in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% FBS and
0.1% Tween 20 at 4°C for 30 minutes, centrifuged to the

pellet, and resuspended. Then, the cells were treated with
RNase (5 μg/mL) at 37°C for 1 hour and stained with
propidium iodide and BrdU. The cells were analyzed using
FACSCalibur (BD).

Colony forming assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

To determine anchorage-independent cell growth,
1 × 104 cells (SNUOT-Rb1) were suspended in 3 mL of
media containing 0.3% agar with 10% FBS and applied
onto pre-solidified 0.6% agar (3 mL) with no FBS in 60mm dishes. Each experiment was performed triplicate.
After 3 weeks of incubation, colonies on soft agar were
observed under a phase-contrast microscope. The colony
size and number were determined with the Metamorph 7.1
program (Universal Imaging) using the photographs.

Orthotopic transplation of retinoblastoma cells
Y79 or SNUOT-Rb1 cells were injected into
the vitreous cavity of Balb/c nude mice as previously
described. To evaluate the effects of carboplatin treatment,
carboplatin (50 mg/Kg) was intraperitoneally injected 3
times per week from 2 weeks after the injection of tumor
cells. At 4 weeks after the tumor injection, mice were
euthanized with CO2 inhalation after deep anesthesia. The
eyes were evaluated by visual grading and then enucleated
for further hematoxylin and eosin staining.

The MDR functions were analyzed by
EFLUXX-ID® Green Multidrug Resistance Assay
Kit (cat. no. ENZ-51029-K100, Enzo) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, single cell
suspensions were harvested and counted. Then, equal
numbers of cells (5 X 105) were resuspended in RPMI1640 media containing 5 % FBS with inhibitors or
DMSO as diluent control and incubated at 37°C for
10 minutes. Final concentrations of inhibitors are as
follows: Verapamil (MDR1 inhibitor; 50 μM); MK571 (MRP1 inhibitor; 100 μM); Novobiocin (BCRP
inhibitor; 100 μM). Green dye was then added and
incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were washed once
in ice cold complete indicator-free medium before FACS
data acquisition using a FACSCalibur (BD). Propidium
iodide was used to exclude dead cells from the analysis.
Data were analyzed using FlowJo software.
