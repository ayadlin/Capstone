ABSTRACT:
Cadherin-11 (CDH11), associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transformation
in development, poor prognosis malignancies and cancer stem cells, is also a major
therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CDH11 expressing basal-like breast
carcinomas and other CDH11 expressing malignancies exhibit poor prognosis. We
show that CDH11 is increased early in breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in-situ.
CDH11 knockdown and antibodies effective in RA slowed the growth of basallike breast tumors and decreased proliferation and colony formation of breast,
glioblastoma and prostate cancer cells. The repurposed arthritis drug celecoxib, which
binds to CDH11, and other small molecules designed to bind CDH11 without inhibiting
COX-2 preferentially affect the growth of CDH11 positive cancer cells in vitro and
in animals. These data suggest that CDH11 is important for malignant progression,
and is a therapeutic target in arthritis and cancer with the potential for rapid clinical
translation.

INTRODUCTION

(CDH11) and decreased E-cadherin, have been associated
with both EMT and tumor progression [1;4]. CDH11 is
expressed only in poorly differentiated, highly-invasive
cells [5]. All CDH11 positive cell lines are in the basal
B subset of poor prognosis breast cancer cells [3].
Importantly, CDH11 is a therapeutic target in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), an inflammatory disease with properties
often compared with cancer. Systemic administration of
CDH11 antibodies reverses the proliferation and migration
of synoviocytes to the sites of joint inflammation and
attenuates symptoms of RA [6]. As CDH11 antibody based
therapeutics are in clinical trials for RA and we showed

Poor prognosis epithelial-derived cancers often
exhibit morphologic and molecular changes characteristic
of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
EMT markers are predominantly found in tumors with a
basal-like phenotype [1;2]. Breast cancer cell lines can be
divided into subtypes that parallel clinical response [3].
Basal B lineage cells are poorly differentiated, exhibit
mesenchymal morphology, and are frequently highly
aggressive and invasive. Increased expression of the

recently that the arthritis drug celecoxib has the structural
potential to bind CDH11, there is a strong possibility that,
if CDH11 can be shown to drive malignant progression
rather than simply be associated with it, therapeutic
options may be rapidly developed [7]. For example,
CDH11 expression promotes the formation of skeletal
metastases in models of prostate cancer and can regulate
glioma survival and migration [8;9]. To more formally
test the association of CDH11 with poor prognosis
malignancies we first carried out a meta-analysis of
all published datasets to show that in addition to being
elevated in early stages of breast cancer such as ductal
carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), CDH11 is highly expressed
in gastrointestinal, brain and central nervous system
tumors. We go on to show that CDH11 is necessary for
MDA-MB-231 cell tumor growth and that it regulates
proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of
several CDH11 positive tumor cells. Finally, CDH11 is
a type II cadherin, bearing two tryptophan residues with
distinctively large hydrophobic pockets in its extracellular
domain 1 (EC1) binding domain [10]. As type I cadherins
such as E and N-cadherins, only have one tryptophan
residue in their binding pockets, CDH11 offers a somewhat
unique domain for targeting. We showed previously that
the arthritis drug celecoxib had the structural potential to
bind this pocket and now show that celecoxib, a celecoxib
analogue with no COX-2 inhibitory activity, as well as
several novel small molecules can selectively inhibit the
growth of CDH11 expressing breast cancer cells [7].

Some DCIS lesions were completely negative for CDH11
expression, in others CDH11 was expressed on the
periphery of the lesion while in others CDH11 positive
cells extended into the lumen. Comedocarcinoma was the
most common subtype in the positive DCIS foci. CDH11
was expressed at high levels in most invasive ductal
carcinoma cells (IDCs) (Figure 1D). However, in almost
all invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) CDH11 expression
was limited to the stroma (Supplementary Fig. S2.), with
the exception of, pleomorphic ILC in which CDH11
staining was present throughout occasional cells of the
ILC itself (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Pleomorphic ILCs
are more invasive in nature with poor prognosis compared
to other ILCs [18].

Tumor-cell CDH11 is required for subcutaneous
growth in vivo
MDA-MB-231 CDH11-expressing breast cancer
cells were inoculated into nude mice and treated
MatrigelTM with a function-blocking monoclonal CDH11specific antibody that does not exhibit significant sideeffects in inflammatory RA, or control IgG [6]. AntiCDH11 antibody therapy significantly inhibited the
growth of newly injected xenografts (Figure 1E) and of
established tumors compared to control mice (Figure 1F).
Although CDH11 is elevated in cancer stromal
tissue (Figure 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1D) [11;15],
stromal tissue likely contains tumor cells in the process
of invasion as well as host stromal cells and it is not clear
which population contributes to the observed increases in
mRNA. To address this, we used siRNA to knock down
CDH11 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells containing either
one of two different siRNA CDH11 target sequences
completely failed to form tumors in nude mice (n=20)
(Figure 1G). Stable cell lines containing shRNA target
sequences displayed a significant delay to onset of tumor
growth compared to empty vector or scrambled controls.
Tumor growth was observed in one lentivirally-infected
line approximately one month after inoculation (Figure
1H) but these cells were found to be re-expressing CDH11
in vitro as measured by Western blot (data not shown).
These data, along with the functional assays in vitro,
strongly suggest that tumor cell CDH11 is necessary for
MDA-MB-231 tumor growth.

RESULTS:
CDH11 is increased in early stages of human
breast cancer and in other malignancies.
We performed a meta-analysis of all publicly
available human cancer microarray datasets, including
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (http://cancergenome.
nih.gov) containing both normal and tumor information
using OncomineTM. CDH11 is increased in invasive breast
cancers (Figure 1A-C, Supplementary Fig. S1B-E) [1116] and in DCIS when compared to normal tissue (Figure
1C, Supplementary Fig. S1E)[12;16]. CDH11 is markedly
elevated in the stroma of invasive breast cancers compared
to normal stroma (Figure 1B, supplementary Fig. S1D)
[11;15]. These data suggest that increased CDH11 is an
early event in breast cancer progression. In addition to
breast cancer and DCIS, CDH11 was increased in most
data sets from brain and central nervous system (CNS),
and gastrointestinal malignancies (Supplementary Fig.
S1A).
For immunohistochemistry we used an antibody
that exhibits no cross-reactivity with other cadherin
family members [17] (please see materials and methods).

migration (Figure 3A). CDH11 knockdown in PC3 prostate
cancer cells (Figure 2D) also resulted in reduced growth,
but fell short of significance (Figure 2E). However, PC3
cell colony formation (Figure 2F) and migration (Figure
3B) were significantly inhibited by decreased CDH11.
CDH11 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 cells also
prevented the formation of branched networks during the
first week of culture in MatrigelTM (Figure 3C); but over
the following week, CDH11 knockdown cells formed
networks that were indistinguishable from controls (data
not shown) suggesting that CDH11 is not absolutely
necessary for network formation.
Glioblastomas are the most common and invasive
brain cancer in humans with poor clinical prognosis.
LN229 cells are glioblastoma cell lines that express
both mesenchymal cadherins (CDH11 and N-cadherin).
Interestingly, the growth and migration of LN229
glioblastoma cells were more sensitive to CDH11 than
N-cadherin knockdown (Figure 3D-F).

(Supplementary Fig. S5). The structure of Sd-133 is the
most drug-like, indeed it resembles that of celecoxib, and
we chose to move forward with it as our lead compound.
Using thiol coupling, we immobilized cysteine-tagged
mouse CDH11 (EC1-2 domain) on a SPR CM5 chip and
injected wild type CDH11 at different concentrations.
SPR demonstrated reproducible dose dependent CDH11
homophilic binding (homodimerization) (Figure 4H).
Since, there is simultaneous dimerization occurring both in
the injected “analyte” and “ligand” fraction (immobilized
CDH11 on the surface) a portion of these molecules will
be unavailable for dimerization in this assay and the Kd
cannot be precisely calculated using SPR. Equilibrium
analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the dissociation
constant for CDH11 is 25.2±4.3 micromolar [19;20]. To
confirm that Sd-133 binds directly to CDH11, we tested
the ability of Sd-133 to compete for CDH11 homotypic
binding using SPR. Simultaneous injection of Sd133 with mouse CDH11 (EC1-2) [19] protein reduced
soluble CDH11 binding to immobilized CDH11 on the
surface of the chip in a dose dependent manner (Figure
4J). Like celecoxib and DMC, Sd-133 significantly
inhibited the growth of all three CDH11 positive cell
lines with an EC50 of ~3µM but had little effect on
CDH11 negative MCF7 cells (Figure 5A, B, Table 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S4C). Sd-133 also inhibited MDAMB-231 MatrigelTM outgrowth at 1µM (Figure 5C) but
was inactive on control MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells
(express N-cadherin) or MCF7 breast cancer cells that
express E and P-cadherin (Figure 5D). In addition, Sd133 inhibited MDA-MB-231 colony formation (Figure
5E, F). The activity of Sd-133 likely stems from its shape
and moderate structural flexibility, which enable it to
accommodate and bind tightly to, the W-binding pocket
(Figure 5G, H). Though this binding pocket is largely
hydrophobic, a network of hydrogen bonds between
Sd-133 and R23, H25, P88, S90 confers specificity and
rigid binding. Hydrophobic interaction of Sd-133 with
F7, L24, S26, Y37, A75, A77, E87, S90, and F92 may
also contribute to its action (Figure 5H). Furthermore,
the mobility of the water molecule located near S90
(PDB:2A4C) enables this residue to adjust its position to
form H-bonds with the inhibitors. Two other inhibitors,
Sd-037 and Sd-073, have similar interactions with the
W pocket (Figure 5I, J). The water mediated H-bond is
observed with all three inhibitors (Figure 5G-J). All three
inhibitors compete for W binding and interact with the
same residues including the water molecule formed by the
two W residues (Figures 4B, 5G-J). Upon superimposition
of Sd-133, Sd-037 and Sd-073 within the W pocket,
it is clear that the hydrophobic moieties of these three
inhibitors occupy the same space as that of hydrophobic
W residues (Figure 5K). We tested several W mimics
including dindolylmethane (DIM) analogs of the peptide
motif ‘SGWVW’, but did not achieve the potency of Sd133 or celecoxib. Structural modeling and MD simulations

The arthritis drug celecoxib (CelebrexTM),
preferentially inhibits the growth of CDH11
positive basal-like breast cancer cells.
CDH11 has unique hydrophobic pockets that are
potential sites to interfere with cell-cell adhesion (figure
4A) [10]. Recently, using a new proteochemometric
computational drug repurposing method we unexpectedly
found that the FDA approved drug celecoxib, and DMC a
celecoxib analogue without COX2 inhibitory activity had
the structural potential to bind CDH11. We used Surface
Plasmon Resonance (SPR) [7] and a native gel assay to
show direct binding and inhibition of CDH11 dimerization
(Figure 4G). The structural models of celecoxib and
DMC binding to CDH11 are shown in Figure 4 C and D.
Celecoxib and DMC inhibit the growth of CDH11 positive
MDA-MB-231, BT549 and Hs578T basal-like breast
cancer cells with EC50s in the 1-5 micromolar range
but did not affect CDH11 negative MCF7 cells up to 40
micromolar (Figure 4E, F, Supplementary Fig. S4A, B).

Novel small molecule CDH11 inhibitors
specifically inhibit CDH11 mediated growth and
migration in vitro
We reasoned that a small molecule that blocks
the CDH11 EC1 dimer-formation would inhibit CDH11
function. We used this structure as a basis for molecular
simulations to produce pharmacophores designed to
block one or both of two adjacent regions (P1 and P2)
predicted to be necessary for CDH11 function in cellcell adhesion. The 29 most promising compounds were
obtained and tested. Three compounds: Sd-133, Sd037, and Sd-073 (Figure 4I) were active in the 1-10uM
range attesting to the efficiency of the in silico screen

expressing tumors. DMC has structural and EC-50
similarity to our lead compound sd-133, does not inhibit
COX2 and has previously been used in animals [21].
As early as 50 hours following administration, the
proliferation rate of CDH11 positive MDA-231 tumors
was significantly reduced (P=0.0006) whereas CDH11
negative MCF7 tumors were unaffected (Figure 6A, B).
No differences were observed in apoptosis, suggesting that
DMC was not toxic at this dosage (Figure 6C)

unfavorably to depletion of CDH11 because it is essential
for their growth and progression. Similarly, synoviocytes
depend on CDH11, for migration, invasion and growth
[6]. Our analysis of all published human breast cancer
microarray datasets as well as our immunohistochemical
studies showed that increased CDH11 is an early event
in breast cancer progression. Breast cancer patients may
also shed CDH11 and/or CDH11-expressing cells into
the circulation, which could potentially be utilized as a
biomarker and/or companion diagnostic [26].
Although our microarray meta-analyses did not
show a relationship between CDH11 (or N-cadherin) to
prostate cancer (Supplementary Fig. S1A) the datasets
we examined, did not indicate, and likely do not include
androgen resistant forms of the disease in which both
N-cadherin and CDH11 are elevated [27;28]. Indeed,
significant reduction of growth and cell migration occurred
upon CDH11 knockdown in PC3 prostate cancer cells
[29]. We did not observe such a strong growth effect but
noted significant reduction in cell migration and delayed
MatrigelTM outgrowth.
CDH11 is a major target in RA, an inflammatory
disease frequently compared with cancer. CDH11 controls
the synovial response in RA and targeting CDH11
either by knockout or with antibodies reduced RA in
mouse models [6]. In this study we show that the same
CDH11 antibodies significantly inhibited the growth
of mesenchymal/basal-like MDA-MB-231 xenografts.
The cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective NSAIDS such
as celecoxib (CelebrexTM) and the now discontinued
rofecoxib (VioxxTM) are treatments of for patients with RA.
Celecoxib also has well known anti-cancer properties [3033] and RA patients treated with celecoxib or rofecoxib
have a lower risk of breast, prostate and colorectal
cancers [34;35]. However, although there is no doubt that
celecoxib is an excellent inhibitor of COX-2 there is much
debate over its COX-2 independent activities and if these
could play a role in its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer
effects [36-39]. Recently, drug-repositioning has come
into the spot-light as a significant time saving and cost
effective alternative to traditional drug-discovery methods
[7;40]. Our recent computational drug repurposing screens
indicated that celecoxib is likely to interact with targets
other than COX-2 and in a completely serendipitous
observation, predicted that celecoxib is likely to interact
with the CDH11 tryptophan pocket [7]. In the present
study we confirmed the CDH11 inhibitory activity of
celecoxib and its inactive (wrt COX2-inhibition) analogue
DMC. Previous studies show that celecoxib preferentially
inhibits the growth of xenografts of cells we now know
to be CDH11 expressors such as MDA-231 cells and
gliomas [41;42]. In addition celecoxib induces apoptosis
in CDH11 positive synovial fibroblasts in a COX-2
independent manner and DMC inhibits glioma growth in
animals [21;43]. Here we show a significant reduction in
proliferation of MDA-231 transplanted cells using DMC.

DISCUSSION
The work presented here confirms the association of
CDH11 with a number of malignancies and demonstrates
that CDH11 is an important driver of certain poor
prognosis cancers, as it is in RA. We further show that
CDH11 can be directly targeted in tumor cells using
CDH11 antibodies and repositioned drugs such as
celecoxib that are effective in RA. Taken together with
our discovery of novel small molecule inhibitors there is
a strong possibility that therapeutic options for CDH11dependent malignancies and inflammatory diseases may
be rapidly developed and tested in humans. It is plausible
that CDH11 expression in breast cancer is a component
of the EMT that allows cells to progress and metastasize
[22]. CDH11 is expressed in breast cell lines characterized
as Basal B, as well as poor prognosis malignancies
including glioblastoma multiforme for which no effective
treatment exists [5;9]. These associations suggest that
CDH11 is expressed in highly aggressive tumors resistant
to treatment. Breast tumor stroma contains mesenchymal
stem cells that express factors vital for malignant
progression [15]. CDH11 is expressed by mesenchymal
stem cells prior to differentiation into adipose or muscle
tissues, continue through their differentiation into
chondrocytes and osteoblasts and is observed in the
stromal component of DCIS lesions [23;24]. CDH11
was also mostly limited to the stroma of the ILCs.
Consequently, although our data demonstrates that stromal
CDH11 is not exclusively responsible for changes in tumor
growth at least in breast cancer, CDH11 expressing cells
in the stroma almost certainly contribute to tumorigenesis,
perhaps even in CDH11-negative tumors.
MDA-MB-231 cells preferentially metastasize to the
skeleton following intracardiac injection in nude mice [8].
CDH11 may facilitate bone metastasis by mediating direct
interaction with osteoblasts [25]. However, it is necessary
to distinguish anti-growth effects of CDH11 depletion from
anti-metastatic properties. In our studies cell proliferation
and tumor growth were inhibited upon CDH11 depletion
in MDA-MB-231 cells suggesting that a portion of the
“metastatic” potential may be a result of alterations in
cell proliferation. The current work also demonstrates
the critical role that CDH11 plays in tumorigenesis of
aggressive, basal or mesenchymal-like breast cancer. We
propose that cells, which have undergone EMT, respond

Taken together these data suggest that, in addition to other
suggested celecoxib targets such as survivin, the ER stress
response and PDK1, CDH11 may play a role in mediating
the COX-2 independent effects of the CelebrexTM family
of anti-inflammatories in cancer and in RA [42;44].
Although the binding mode of celecoxib and DMC
to the CDH11 tryptophan-binding pocket is slightly
different from the CDH11 inhibitors specifically designed
to do so (Figure 4C, D), all the effective CDH11 inhibitors
compete for hydrogen bonds with the H25 backbone. The
volume and topography of the pockets in the tryptophan
site (Figure 4 C, D) may provide an opportunity to modify
and optimize CDH11 inhibitors for shape, size, and
polarity to maximize interaction and potency.
CDH11 over-expression in a subset of DCIS
indicates it as an early event in breast cancer development.
Although invasiveness of a tumor is likely determined
in early pre-malignant phases [45] not all DCIS lesions
develop into invasive ductal carcinomas [46]. As not all
DCIS lesions are CDH11 positive and high expression
occurs in comedo type DCIS, a subclass with greater
risk of recurrence, CDH11 positive lesions may be more
likely to develop into invasive breast cancer [47]. Our data
indicates that CDH11 is an important factor in malignant
progression and is a promising therapeutic target in poor
prognosis breast cancers and other CDH11 expressing
malignancies such as glioblastoma, and perhaps
androgen-independent prostate cancer. We also introduce
an antibody and small molecule inhibitors of CDH11 as
well as an FDA approved drug that are able to inhibit its
function.

cell clones targeting two separate shRNA sequences of the
same CDH11 region were used to infect MDA-MB-231
breast and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Clones were selected
in 15µg/mL puromycin and maintained at 10µg/mL.

Western blot, immunocytochemistry
immunohistochemistry.

Western blots and immunocytochemistry were
carried out as described previously [5]. For Ki67 stained
cells, 10 random high power fields representing the
whole tumor area were selected and 1687±33 cells/
tumor (MDA-231, n=4/group) and 1405±59 cells/tumor
(MCF7, n=3/group) were counted. The proliferation index
was measured as the number of positive cells/total cells
counted x100. Since the rate of apoptosis is much lower
than proliferation, we wanted to avoid any potential bias
due to field selection; therefore the number of TUNEL
positive cells in the whole tumor section was counted
and the apoptosis index was calculated as the number of
positive cells/the number of fields per sample.

MTS cell proliferation/Survival assay:
As cadherin-11 expression is increased with cell
density [48], we determined the maximum cell density for
each cell line that would allow us to be within linear range
of assay detection up to 96 hours post seeding. Based on
those results we used 4000 (Hs578t) or 8000 (all other cell
lines) cells/well in 96 well plates for MTS proliferation
assays. Cells were initially treated at the time of seeding
and medium + compounds replenished at 24, 48 and 72
hours post seeding. 96 hours post-seeding, medium was
replaced with fresh serum-free medium followed by MTS
reagent. Absorbance was read 2 hours post MTS addition
at 490 nm.

METHODS
Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines.
MDA-MB-231, BT-549, HS578, MDA-MD-435,
MCF7 and PC-3 cancer cell lines (ATCC), and all
stable cell lines generated were maintained in DMEM
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 5-10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) as previously described [5]. siRNA vectors were
synthesized using the SilencerTM siRNA Construction Kit
(Ambion) and co-transfected with hygromycin B-resistant
vector or vector alone using Fugene (Roche Diagnostics).
Stable clones were selected using 1mg/mL hygromycin B
and maintained at 0.5 mg/mL. siRNA stable lines were
created using templates with T7 promoter sequences at 3’
end and an AA 5’ overhang (IDT Inc.), using anti-sense
(5’-AACAGCGTGGATGTCGATGACCCTGTCTC-3’)
and
sense
(5’-AAGTCATCGACATCCACGCTGCCTGTCTC-3’)

In-vivo studies to assess the effect of CDH11
knockdown, CDH11 antibody and CDH11
inhibitors.
6-7 week old female athymic nude mice (Harlan
research laboratory) were inoculated with approximately
2 x106 cells in the mammary fat pad. For growth inhibition
studies, mice were treated i.p. initially with 0.5 mg
13C2 (anti-CDH11) or control IgG followed by 0.1 mg
for subsequent injections (x3/wk) for one month. This
antibody was generated by immunizing CDH11 deficient
mice with purified CDH11 EC(1-5)-mouse IgG2a FC
fusion protein followed by generation of hybridomas
and validated to be specific against cadherin-11[6].
We used the (π/6)xLxWxH formula to calculate tumor
volume. To study the effect of antibody therapy on
inhibition of established tumors, mice were left untreated

post inoculation until tumor size reached approximately
50 mm3 then were treated with 20 mg/kg (x2/wk).
For xenografts of RNAi or shRNA expressing MDAMB-231 cells, 1-2 x106 stable cells were injected s.c.
into 1 of 4 ventral side mammary fat pads such that both
control and RNAi-expressing cells were injected in each
animal. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula
D1xD2xD3 (D1=length, D2=width, D3=depth of tumor)
using calipers, x2/week. Experiments were repeated x3 for
all cell lines. To study the effects of CDH11 inhibitors on
tumor cell proliferation in vivo we inoculated nude mice
with MDA-231 or MCF7 cells. Once the tumors became
palpable, animals were treated with 150mg/kg/day of
DMC by oral gavage.
