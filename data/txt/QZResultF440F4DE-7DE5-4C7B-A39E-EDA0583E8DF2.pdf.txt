Abstract
The DNA damage response (DDR) activates downstream pathways including cell cycle checkpoints. The
cyclin D1 gene is overexpressed or amplified in many human cancers and is required for gastrointestinal,
breast, and skin tumors in murine models. A common polymorphism in the human cyclin D1 gene is
alternatively spliced, resulting in cyclin D1a and D1b proteins that differ in their carboxyl terminus. Cyclin
D1 overexpression enhances DNA damage–induced apoptosis. The role of cyclin D1 and the alternative
splice form in regulating the DDR is not well understood. Herein cyclin D1a overexpression enhanced the
DDR as characterized by induction of γH2AX phosphorylation, the assembly of DNA repair foci, specific
recruitment of DNA repair factors to chromatin, and G2-M arrest. Cyclin D1 deletion in fibroblasts or
small interfering RNA–mediated reduction of endogenous cyclin D1 in colon cancer cells reduced the
5-fluorouracil–mediated DDR. Mechanistic studies showed that cyclin D1a, like DNA repair factors, elicited
the DDR when stably associated with chromatin. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8802–11. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The ability to sense DNA damage is determined through activation of the serine/threonine kinase, ataxia-telangiectasia
mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK), and ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR;
ref. 1). Replication stress induces ATR activation, whereas
both ATM and ATR are induced in response to doublestranded DNA break repair. The rapid targeting of DNA repair
factors near the site of damage gives rise to nuclear foci (2).
The early DNA damage sensor complex involves MRE11/
Rad50/NBS1 (MRN), the transducer proteins MDC1 and
53BP1, and the phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase ATM/DNAPK/ATR which phosphorylate H2AX and the Chk1/Chk2 cell
cycle kinases (3). Phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine
residues of the carboxyl terminus (Ser139), producing γH2AX,
recruits proteins that sense or signal the presence of DNA
damage, inducing the response that leads to DNA repair (4).

The role of the DNA damage response (DDR) in tumorigenesis is complex. Defects of the MRN complex occur at
the preinvasive carcinoma in situ, and γH2AX activation
is commonly observed among familial breast tumors (5).
Activated oncogenes are capable of inducing both doublestranded DNA break (DSB) and a DDR in NIH3T3 cells.
These oncogenes include myc, ras, mos, cdc25A, E2F1, and
cyclin E (6–8). DNA damage is also a feature of premalignant
tissue (9, 10), suggesting that oncogenic stress in nonmalignant cells may contribute to tumorigenesis. Preferential
activation of the DDR occurs in early, preinvasive lesions
including ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (9, 10).
Activation of cell cycle control proteins is also an early
feature of tumorigenesis. The cyclins encode essential components of the cell-cycle machinery, binding and activating
their specific cyclin-dependent kinase partners (11). The
abundance of cyclin D1 has been shown to play a role in
cell type–dependent radiation-induced sensitivity. Cyclin
D1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) have enhanced
apoptosis evoked by γ irradiation (12), and cyclin D1 expression also inhibited UV-induced apoptosis in the presence of p300 (13). In contrast, breast cancer cell lines
overexpressing cyclin D1 showed enhanced apoptosis in response to γ irradiation (14, 15), suggesting cell type–specific
differences governing cyclin D1–mediated apoptosis. The
abundance of cyclin D1 mediates a G1 cell-cycle arrest, as
interference with cyclin D1 degradation prevents G1 arrest
in cell exposed to γ irradiation–induced DNA damage (12)
and G2-M arrest (16). Collectively these studies suggest that
overexpression of cyclin D1 enhances γ irradiation–induced
apoptosis, but the role of endogenous cyclin D1 and the
molecular mechanisms by which cyclin D1 may mediate
the DDR are not well understood.

Cyclin D1 on DNA Damage Response

The cyclin D1 gene encodes the regulatory subunit of a holoenzyme that phosphorylates the pRb protein. In addition,
cyclin D1 promotes cell migration, regulates cellular metabolism, conveys transcriptional functions, and is recruited to
DNA in the context of local chromatin (17). The human cyclin
D1 gene is polymorphic (reviewed in ref. 18). The polymorphism (A870G), located at the splice donor region at the exon
4–intron 4 boundary, modulates the efficiency of alternate
splicing between exons 4 and 5. As a result of the altered
splicing that occurs, the coding region downstream is altered
such that the amino acid sequence of the COOH terminus of
cyclin D1 is altered (18). Thus, two isoforms of cyclin D1 are
produced: the canonical isoform termed cyclin D1a and the
alternately spliced isoform termed cyclin D1b. These proteins
are distinct in their COOH termini. Clinical studies have associated this polymorphism with an increased risk of colon
and rectal cancer, early-onset squamous cell carcinoma, head
and neck cancer, and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (18, 19). Both isoforms encode regulatory subunits that
can stimulate CDK4/6 activity; however, cyclin D1b has a reduced capacity to phosphorylate pRb and advance cell cycle
progression (20). The role of cyclin D1a versus the cyclin D1b
isoform in the DNA damage response has not previously
been examined. It may be important in understanding the
differences in transforming capacity of the two isoforms
(20) and/or targeting therapy for cancer patients.
The current studies were conducted to determine whether
cyclin D1 isoforms may affect the DDR signal pathway. Small
interfering RNA (siRNA) to endogenous cyclin D1 and isoform-specific reconstitution overexpression experiments in
Cyclin D1−/− MEFs/3T3s allowed the identification of an isoform-specific DDR. Recent studies have indicated that the
physical tethering of these DNA repair factors to chromatin
is sufficient to induce the DDR signaling cascade (21). The
current studies showed that cyclin D1a, but not cyclin D1b,
recruitment to chromatin was sufficient to elicit the DDR.

cancer cells were maintained in DMEM containing penicillin
and streptomycin (100 mg of each/liter) and supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. The NIH2/4 stable cell line that
contains 256 repeats of the lac operator sequence (lacO) stably integrated on chromosome 3 (25) was maintained in
DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/mL hygromycin (Invitrogen). The NIH2/4 stable cell line was transfected
using the Nucleofector kit for immortalized cell lines (Amaxa,
Nucleofector R) as described previously (21). For the analysis
of cyclin D1–mediated responses after DNA damage, MEFs or
3T3 cells were treated with ionizing radiation at the indicated
dosage and times after treatment or doxorubicin (Sigma) at
the indicated dosage and period of time of treatment.
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was conducted as described
previously (22).
Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were conducted as described previously (22).
Neutral pH comet assay
Neutral pH comet assays were conducted using the CometAssay Kit (Trevigen). After treatment with doxorubicin or
control, cells were harvested and mixed with low-melting
temperature agarose. After lysis, electrophoresis was conducted at 1 V/cm for 20 minutes. Slides were stained with
SYBG green dye for 10 minutes and visualized on a Zeiss
LSM 510 META confocal microscope with a ×20 objective.
The relative length and intensity of SYBG green–stained
DNA tails to heads was proportional to the amount of
DNA damage present in the individual nuclei and was
measured by Olive tail moment using TriTek Comet Score
software (TriTek; ref. 26).
Additional materials and methods are discussed in Supplementary Information.

Results
Endogenous cyclin D1 mediates the DDR
A surrogate assay for the measurement of DSBs in the cell
is the comet assay. When cells are electrophoresed in neutral
pH, the image looks like a comet with a distinct head composed of intact DNA and a tail consisting of damaged DNA
(27). The comet assay conducted at neutral pH detects mainly DSBs. Comet assays were conducted to examine the role
of endogenous cyclin D1 in the DDR. Cyclin D1 +/+ and
Cyclin D1−/− 3T3 cells were treated with 2 μmol/L doxorubicin for 16 hours. The percentage of cells with a comet tail
was calculated (Fig. 1A). After doxorubicin treatment about
14.5% cells had a comet tail in Cyclin D1+/+ cells, but only
1.4% cells had a comet tail in Cyclin D1−/− cells. These results
suggest that endogenous cyclin D1 increases the DDR. Histone H2AX phosphorylation on a serine residue at the carboxyl terminus (Ser139), producing γH2AX, is a sensitive
marker for DSBs. Western blot analysis was conducted to

detect γH2AX in Cyclin D1+/+ and Cyclin D1−/− MEFs treated
with doxorubicin for 16 hours (Fig. 1B). After doxorubicin
treatment γH2AX increased more in Cyclin D1+/+ cells than
in Cyclin D1−/− cells. To further determine if endogenous cyclin D1 plays a role in DDR we used specific cyclin D1 siRNA
to knock down endogenous cyclin D1 in the HCT116 colon
cancer cell line. Cyclin D1 siRNA reduced cyclin D1 levels, and
reduced 5-fluorouracil (FU)-induced γH2AX phosphorylation.
Rad51 levels were also reduced upon the reduction in cyclin
D1 protein levels (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these studies suggest
that endogenous cyclin D1 contributes to the DDR.
Cyclin D1a induces the cellular DDR and DSBs
To determine the specific requirement for cyclin D1a versus cyclin D1b in the DDR we conducted Cyclin D1−/− cell
reconstitution overexpression analysis. Cyclin D1−/− cells
were transduced with a retroviral expression vector encoding
either cyclin D1a or cyclin D1b to overexpress each isoform.
Two types of analysis were conducted to assess the relative
abundance of the D-type cyclin in the reconstitution by
Western blot analysis. As cellular transduction was high,
the relative abundance of cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b was approximately 3- to 4-fold greater than endogenous cyclin D1
level (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). At a single cell level
the relative abundance of cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b was similar to the abundance of endogenous cyclin D1b (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). (The difference in relative abundance
per cell versus total abundance by Western blot is because

endogenous cyclin D1a expression fluctuates during the cell
cycle and is at low levels during early G1 and late S and G2-M.)
These cell populations were treated with doxorubicin
(2 μmol/L) to induce DNA damage. Cyclin D1a enhanced
comet formation 4-fold compared with the control vector
(P < 0.01). In contrast, although cyclin D1b was expressed at
similar levels to cyclin D1a (Supplementary Fig. S1), comet
activity was induced only about 80% (Fig. 2A). Cyclin D1a
increased the DDR assessed by comet assay significantly
more than did cyclin D1b (P < 0.01; Fig. 2A).
The DDR response is capable of inducing a cell cycle arrest at
the G1-S or G2-M boundary. To determine whether the cyclin
D1a–mediated DDR was associated with cell-cycle arrest,
propidium iodide (PI) staining and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis was conducted. Doxorubicin increased
the proportion of cells in the G2-M phase in Cyclin D1−/− MEFs
(Fig. 2B). Reintroduction of cyclin D1a into Cyclin D1−/− MEFs
increased the proportion of G2-M cells from 27.7% to 49.2% and
enhanced doxorubicin-mediated induction of G2-M from 36.7%
to 64.3% (Fig. 2B). In contrast, cyclin D1b failed to change the
basal or doxorubicin-induced G2-M phase (27.7% to 28.8%,
36.7% to 36.6%; Fig. 2B).
Phosphorylation of H2AX (known as γH2AX) is the most
studied chromatin modification induced by double-strand
breaks. DSB induction of γH2AX results in the formation
of large foci that are important for the accumulation and retention of DSB repair factors. Assemblage of nuclear repair
foci containing γH2AX was assessed in Cyclin D1−/− MEFs

transduced with each cyclin D1 isoform. Cyclin D1a
enhanced the basal- (Fig. 3A) and radiation-induced γH2AX
(Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis showed that cyclin D1a enhanced more doxorubicin-mediated γH2AX (Fig. 3C). Cyclin
D1b also induced γH2AX, but quantitatively the effect was
significantly less ((Fig. 3C, lane 4 versus lane 6), γH2AX
L.E., S.E.). Western blot analysis of Cyclin D1−/−-transduced
cells with an antibody directed to the FLAG epitope confirmed the expression of cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b in the
Cyclin D1−/− MEFs (Fig. 3B and C).
γH2AX has been reported to occur after DDR in all phases of
the cell cycle (28) or at the site of replication fork breakage in
the S phase of SV40-transformed Hela cells (29, 30). Cyclin D1
has been shown to inhibit S-phase entry in some studies (31)
or promote S-phase entry in other studies (32). The induction

www.aacrjournals.org

of DNA synthesis by cyclin D1 could potentially contribute to
the DDR induction of replication forks. In the current studies
S phase was increased from 12.2% to 14.3% (Fig. 2B). The
kinetics of DDR induction was rapid (15 minutes) and preceded the effect on DNA synthesis (>6 hours). Cyclin D1 induction
of DNA synthesis requires the serum-dependent association
with Cdk (33). To examine whether the effect of cyclin D1a
on the DDR could be further uncoupled from the effect on
DNA synthesis we examined the effect of cyclin D1 on
the DDR in the absence of serum. The Cyclin D1 +/+ and
Cyclin D1−/− cells had reduced DNA synthesis in the absence
of serum (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Cyclin D1 significantly
enhanced the DDR as assessed by γH2AX induction (Supplementary Fig. S2B) in the absence of serum. Cyclin D1−/− cells
showed no increase in DDR in the absence of serum.

Li et al.

To further examine whether the effect of cyclin D1a to induce
DNA synthesis can be uncoupled from its ability to induce the
DDR we conducted FACS analysis (bromodeoxyuridine/PI) to
assess S phase of doxorubicin-treated Cyclin D1−/− 3T3 cells
transduced with cyclin D1a or cyclin D1b (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Cyclin D1a enhanced the DDR induced by doxorubicin, but did not enhance S-phase entry. Three lines of evidence
therefore suggest that induction of the DDR by cyclin D1a can
be uncoupled from its induction of DNA synthesis. As cyclin
D1 induced the DDR within 15 minutes (Fig. 3B), preceding
DNA synthesis, cyclin D1 induces the DDR in the absence of
serum (Supplementary Fig. S2), and cyclin D1 induces the DDR
of doxorubicin without increasing S phase (Supplementary
Fig. S3). These studies suggest that the ability of cyclin D1 to
induce the DDR can be dissociated from its ability to induce
DNA synthesis.
The cyclin D1a splice form binds to p21CIP1 and
regulates the induction of p21CIP1 abundance
p21CIP1 is an essential target of p53 which governs components of the genotoxic response (34). We had observed that
the abundance of p21CIP1 was increased by transduction of
Cyclin D1−/− cells with cyclin D1a (Fig. 3B and C). p21CIP1
abundance was induced 1 hour after radiation and this induction was enhanced upon expression of cyclin D1a versus

cyclin D1b (Fig. 3B). Correspondingly, the abundance of
p21CIP1 was reduced in MEFs, bone marrow macrophages,
and 3T3 cells lacking cyclin D1 (Fig. 4A). Cyclin D1b induced
the basal level of p21CIP1 but did not enhance the DDR induction of p21CIP1 compared with vector control (Fig. 3B, p21CIP1
L.E., lane 4 versus 12).
The induction of p21CIP1 by cyclin D1 increased the possibility that p21CIP1 may contribute to activation of DSB repair.
To determine the mechanism by which cyclin D1a enhanced
the DDR, p21Cip1−/− MEFs were transduced with retroviral expression vectors encoding cyclin D1a or cyclin D1b and treated with doxorubicin. The expression of cyclin D1a and cyclin
D1b was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). Cyclin D1
antibody (clone DCS-6) was used to detect both the endogenous cyclin D1 and the transduced cyclin D1 isoforms. Cyclin
D1a enhanced basal and doxorubicin-induced phosphorylation of γH2AX (Fig. 4B) and the expression of Rad51. The relative induction of γH2AX and the expression of Rad51 were
greater with cyclin D1a compared with cyclin D1b. The enhancement of doxorubicin-mediated γH2AX phosphorylation and Rad51 expression was abrogated in p21Cip1−/− cells
(Fig. 4B).
The increased abundance of p21CIP1 in Cyclin D1+/+ versus
Cyclin D1−/− cells increased the possibility that cyclin D1 may
physically associate with p21CIP1 to regulate the abundance

The p21CIP1 cDNA was linked to the Gal4 DNA binding
domain, and the interaction with cyclin D1 was assessed in
the context of a cyclin D1-VP16 fusion expression plasmid.
Cyclin D1a enhanced p21CIP1-Gal4 activity ∼9-fold (Fig. 4D,
left). Point mutation of the CDK binding site of cyclin D1 reduced or abrogated interaction with the p21CIP1-Gal4 hybrid
(Fig. 4D, left). The alternate splice form of cyclin D1 (cyclin
D1b) failed to interact significantly with the p21CIP1-Gal4
hybrid (Fig. 4D, left). Reciprocal analysis was conducted in
which the cyclin D1 cDNA was linked to GAL4 and the
p21CIP1 cDNA was linked to VP16 to assess interaction using
a multimeric Gal4 DNA binding site linked to a luciferase reporter (Fig. 4D, right). Cyclin D1a and p21CIP1 coexpression
enhanced reporter activity 5-fold. This activity was reduced
80% using the cyclin D1b cDNA as bait in the two-hybrid
assay (Fig. 4D, right).
Cyclin D1 induces formation of repair factors
to chromatin
To examine further the mechanism by which cyclin D1a
induced the DDR we considered recent studies showing
that the stable association of DDR factors with chromatin
can trigger and amplify the DDR signal via an ATM- and
DNA-PK–dependent manner (21). We had previously
shown that cyclin D1a was in the context of local chromatin in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays at DNA transcription factor binding sites (35, 36). We examined the
possibility that cyclin D1a tethered to chromatin may function in a similar manner as DDR factors to activate the
DDR. DNA repair factors fused to the Escherichia coli
lac-repressor (lacR) and tagged with Cherry-red fluorescent
protein were examined in an NIH3T3 cell line that contains 256 repeats of the lacO stably integrated into chromosome 3, known as NIH2/4 (25). Fusion proteins
accumulated at the lacO array as distinct nuclear foci: immobilization of ATM, NBS1, or MDC1 was sufficient to activate the DDR as evidenced by phosphorylation of H2AX
at the lacO site (Fig. 5A–C). Phosphorylation of H2AX at
the lacO site was enhanced by NBS1, MDC1, or ATM alone
as previously shown (21). Immobilization of cyclin D1b did
not affect H2AX phosphorylation. Immobilization of cyclin
D1a in chromatin, however, enhanced H2AX phosphorylation substantially (Fig. 5B and C). Thus, immobilization of
cyclin D1a in the context of local chromatin is sufficient to
activate the DDR.
In the absence of DNA damage neither cyclin D1a nor
cyclin D1b can recruit Rad51 to local chromatin (Supplementary Fig. S4). Rad51 is involved in recombination repair
of DSBs. Additional experiments were conducted to address if both cyclin D1 isoforms could recruit Rad51 to local chromatin in response to DNA damage. NIH2/4 cells
were transfected with Cherry-lacR-NLS-cyclin D1a, CherrylacR-NLS-cyclin D1b, or vector control Cherry-lacR-NLS.
Twenty-four hours later cells were treated with 0.4 μmol/L
doxorubicin for 3 hours. Then immunofluorescence staining
was conducted using specific antibody to Rad51. We found
that only cyclin D1a recruits Rad51 to local chromatin in
response to DNA damage (Fig. 5D).

of the DDR signaling pathway. Western blot analysis was
conducted to detect γH2AX. Compared with vehicle control, the DNA-PK inhibitor (NU7026), casein kinase 2
(CK2) inhibitor (TBB), and c-jun-NH-kinase (JNK) inhibitor
(SP600125) reduced doxorubicin-induced γH2AX in cyclin
D1a–transduced cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B; P < 0.05),
but not in control vector–transduced cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). In contrast, the ATM inhibitor (KU55933) did not
show a significant change. These findings suggest cyclin
D1a induction of doxorubicin-induced γH2AX involves
DNA-PK, JNK, and CK2 (Supplementary Fig. S4C).

Discussion
Cyclin D1a enhances the DDR
The current studies provide evidence for an important
new function of cyclin D1a overexpression in amplifying
the cellular DDR. Induction of the DDR by cyclin D1a was
evidenced by enhanced formation of damaged doublestranded DNA assessed by comet assay activity, induction
of Rad51 foci, and formation and induction of γH2AX phosphorylation. Cyclin D1–mediated DDR was observed with the
cyclin D1a versus the cyclin D1b isoform. The physiologic relevance of the amplification of DDR by cyclin D1a was
evidenced by the findings that siRNA to endogenous cyclin
D1 reduced the DDR phenotype. The importance of cyclin
D1a in the DDR was shown using distinct activators of the
DDR, including γ irradiation, double-stranded DNA damage–
inducing agents (doxorubicin, FU), and the targeting of single
DNA repair factors to chromatin.
Previous studies on cyclin D1 in regulating the DDR suggest cell type–dependent functions. Forced expression of cyclin E, but not cyclin D1, in rat embryo fibroblasts induced
aneuploidy but did not affect gene amplification (37). Forced
expression of a degradation-defective mutant of cyclin E induced more aneuploidy (37). In subsequent studies, genomewide microarray analysis showed that cyclin D1 induced
expression of genes involved in DNA replication and DNA
damage checkpoints, suggesting a role for cyclin D1 in the
DDR. Cyclin D1a induced the mRNA expression of minichromosome maintenance 3 (MCM3), MCM4, replication factor C
(activator 1) 4 (Rfc4), cell division cycle 6 homology (Cdc6),
cell division cell associated 7 (Cdc7), and H2Afx (H2A Histone family member X) in MEFs (35). Mammary gland–
targeted cyclin D1–inducible antisense transgenics showed
that endogenous cyclin D1 maintained expression of
MCM2, Rfc2, Cdc20, Rad51, and histone 1 in the mammary
epithelium (38). In subsequent studies forced expression of
cyclin D1 induced expression of genes regulating the DDR,

Cyclin D1 on DNA Damage Response

Figure 5. A to C, immobilization of single DNA
repair factors, or the cyclin D1a splice form,
on chromatin leads to DDR activation. A, schematic
representation of the chimeric fusion proteins in
which the DNA repair factors, or the cyclin D1
isoforms, were linked to Cherry-lacR-NLS.
B, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of
NIH2/4 cells transiently transfected with cyclin D1
isoforms or repair factor fused to Cherry-lacR-NLS
(red). Phosphorylation of γH2AX (green) indicates
DDR activation. C, γH2AX phosphorylation on the
lacO array was quantitated for >40 cells and was
normalized with the cherry-lacR-NLS vector control
for a representative example from three separate
experiments. D, cyclin D1a isoform recruits
Rad51 to local chromatin in response to DNA
damage. NIH2/4 cells were transfected with
Cherry-lacR-NLS-cyclin D1a, Cherry-lacR-NLScyclin D1b, or vector control Cherry-lacR-NLS by
using Nuclofector system. Twenty-four hours later
cells were treated with 0.4 μmol/L doxorubicin for
3 hours. Then immunofluorescence staining was
conducted using specific antibody to Rad51
(clone H-92). Lower part, model of Cherry-lacR/
lacO system and cyclin D1a inducing γH2AX foci in
the absence of DNA damage, cyclin D1a recruiting
Rad51 to local chromatin in response to DNA
damage, and cyclin D1b failing to recruit Rad51
even in the response to DNA damage.

as MCM3 and Cdc7 (39) expression was increased in mammary tumors derived from mammary epithelial cell–targeted
cyclin D1a transgenic mice. Forced expression of a degradationdefective cyclin D1a mutant induced the DDR in murine
lymphoid tissue (40). Thus, prior indirect evidence implicated
cyclin D1 in enhancing gene expression governing the DDR
in a number of different cell types.
Cyclin D1 induction of the DDR requires p21CIP1
Herein cyclin D1 bound to, and augmented the abundance
of, p21CIP1. In p21Cip1−/− MEFs, cyclin D1 expression failed to
increase doxorubicin-induced γH2AX (Fig. 5B). This suggests
that cyclin D1 may increase the DDR through p21CIP1. Previous studies showed that downregulation of p21CIP1 inhibited
Rad51 foci formation (41). Expression of Rad51, which is involved in the repair of DSBs induced by cisplatin and other
platinum agents (42, 43), was induced by cyclin D1a. Elevated
Rad51 levels are found in tumor cell lines and primary tumors
(34), and correlated with resistance to drug and radiation
therapy, tumor recurrence (44), and poor prognosis (45–47).
The functions of a number of tumor suppressor genes have
been linked to elevated Rad51 levels, suggesting that increased Rad51 activity may promote tumorigenesis (34, 44).
Cyclin D1a recruitment to local chromatin elicits
the DDR
The current studies showed that the recruitment of cyclin
D1a, but not cyclin D1b, is sufficient to activate the DDR. The
recruitment of DNA repair factors to chromatin is also sufficient to elicit the DDR characterized by γH2AX phosphorylation. In previous studies, cyclin D1a reintroduction into
Cyclin D1−/− cells resulted in recruitment of cyclin D1 to
chromatin at a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element, associated with local deacetylation of core
histones, in particular of H3Lys9 (35). Cyclin D1a recruits
SUV39 and HP1α (35) to local chromatin and HP1β mobili-

zation is thought to promote chromatin changes that initiate
the DDR (48). The recruitment of DNA repair factors to chromatin induces a G2-M delay (25). In previous studies DNAdamaging agents, and as shown here, cyclin D1a, induced a
G2-M arrest. As cyclin D1a enhanced recruitment of DNA repair factors to chromatin this effect may contribute to the
G2-M arrest.
Cyclin D1 is expressed early in a variety of human cancers
and premalignant diseases, including colonic polyps and
breast ductal carcinoma in situ. Activation of the DDR occurs
in human cancer (49). The current studies suggest that cyclin
D1a may contribute to the induction of DDR in tumors. The
induction of DDR occurred more with cyclin D1a than with
cyclin D1b. Clinical studies will be important to determine
the role of cyclin D1 isoforms in therapeutic stratification
of patients receiving therapy inducing the DDR.
