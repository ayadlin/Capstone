Abstract
The family of statins includes pharmacologic inhibitors of the
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase that are potent
regulators of cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition to their
cholesterol-lowering effects, statins inhibit cell proliferation
and promote apoptosis of malignant cells in vitro, but their
potential therapeutic roles in the treatment of malignancies
remain to be defined. We examined the effects of statins on the
growth and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
cells. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin were found to be potent
inducers of cell differentiation and apoptosis of the NB4 acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line. Such effects correlated
with activation of the small G-proteins Rac1/Cdc42 and
downstream engagement of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
kinase pathway, whose function was found to be essential for
the generation of proapoptotic responses. Importantly, different statins were found to enhance all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA)–dependent differentiation of APL blasts and reverse
resistance to the antileukemic effects of ATRA. In addition,
fluvastatin exhibited growth-inhibitory properties on primary
bone marrow–derived leukemic progenitors from patients
with AML and enhanced the suppressive effects of ATRA on
leukemic progenitor colony formation. Altogether, these
studies establish that statins exhibit potent antileukemic
properties in vitro and raise the possibility that combinations
of statins with ATRA may be an effective approach to
overcome the development of ATRA resistance by the leukemic
cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4524–32]

Introduction
Statins are pharmacologic inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, an enzyme that is responsible for the
conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate (1). There are at least
eight known members of this family that differ in their hydrophatic profile, spanning from very hydrophobic (e.g., cerivastatin)
to partly hydrophobic (e.g., rosuvastatin) profiles (2). Due to their
ability to prevent the formation of mevalonate, decrease cholesterol biosynthesis, and lower the serum levels of low-density
lipoproteins, statins are widely used in the treatment of
hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease in humans
(3–10). The introduction of statins in clinical medicine has had a
dramatic effect on the prognosis of patients with coronary artery
disease and has changed the natural history of this disease.

In addition to reducing cholesterol levels, statins have potent
anti-inflammatory properties, and there is evidence that they
exhibit antineoplastic activities as well (11, 12). Various statins have
been previously shown to exhibit antiproliferative effects on tumor
cells via regulatory effects on cell cycle (11–13) and to induce
apoptosis of malignant cells of diverse origin (14–19). There has
been particular interest on the potential role of statins as
antileukemic agents, as some of them have been previously shown
to exhibit antileukemic properties in vitro (14, 16, 20–22). There is
also evidence that cholesterol synthesis and import contribute to
protective cholesterol increments in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
cells (20), whereas cholesterol-modulating agents have been shown
to kill AML cells and/or to sensitize them to chemotherapy by
blocking adaptive cholesterol responses (21). Moreover, blocking
protein geranylation is essential for lovastatin-induced apoptosis of
human AML cells (22).
Although the effects of statins on cell cycle regulation and
induction of apoptosis are well described, very little is known on
the ability of these agents to induce leukemic cell differentiation.
There has been some previous evidence that simvastatin (23) and
lovastatin (24) promote osteoblastic differentiation while they
inhibit adipocytic differentiation, but their effects on differentiation
of acute leukemia cells remain to be established. In the present
work, we examined the effects of new-generation statins on cells of
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) origin. Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin were found to induce apoptosis of the NB4
APL cell line that expresses the t(15;17) translocation. Statins were
also found to activate Rac1/Cdc42 and the c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase (JNK) pathway, and such activation was required for statindependent induction of apoptosis. Treatment of NB4 cells with
statins also resulted in a time-dependent neutrophilic differentiation and growth-inhibitory effects. Importantly, statins induced
granulocytic cell differentiation of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)–
resistant variant NB4 cell lines and reversed resistance of primary
APL blasts to the effects of ATRA, raising the possibility that their
combined use with retinoids may prove to be an effective approach
to overcome retinoid resistance. Finally, statins were found to
reverse ATRA resistance and enhance the suppressive effects of
ATRA on leukemic progenitors from other AML subtypes,
suggesting that combinations of statins with ATRA may be
effective in other subtypes of AML that are normally resistant to
ATRA.

Statins and Acute Myeloid Leukemia
2-(p-Methoxybenzyl)-3,4-pyrrolidinediol-3-acetate (anisomycin), SP600125,
SB203580, and PD98059 were obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies against
the phosphorylated forms of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK;
Thr180/Tyr182), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2; Thr202/
Tyr204), and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Polyclonal antibodies against
Erk1/2 and SAPK/JNK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. An
anti-JNK1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and was
used for immunoprecipitations. A cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of JNK
(JNKI) was purchased from Axxora. Polyclonal antibodies against p38 and
p21Waf1/Cip1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An antibody
against human cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Asp214) was
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. An anti-tubulin monoclonal
antibody was obtained from Abcam. An anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody was obtained from Chemicon
International. For the in vitro kinase assays, a c-Jun substrate was obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
isolated from the peripheral blood or bone marrow of patients with AML,
after obtaining informed consent approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Northwestern University.
Cell lysis and immunoblotting. Cells were treated with different statins
for the indicated times at a final concentrations of 10 Amol/L, unless
otherwise indicated, and were subsequently lysed in phosphorylation lysis
buffer (PBL), as previously described (25, 26). Immunoprecipitations and
immunoblotting using an enhanced chemiluminescence method were done
as in previous studies (27–29).
In vitro kinase assays. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence
of statins for the indicated times. The cells were subsequently lysed in PLB
(27, 28), and lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against
JNK1 using protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated complexes were
subsequently washed thrice with PLB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and
twice with kinase buffer (25 mmol/L HEPES, 25 mmol/L MgCl2, 25 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 20 Amol/L
ATP) and resuspended in 30 AL of kinase buffer containing 3 Ag c-Jun fusion
protein, used as an exogenous substrate; 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP was added to
the mixture, and after 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the
reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins
were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of c-Jun was
detected by autoradiography.
Rac1 and Cdc42 activation assays. The activation of Rac1 and Cdc42
were determined as in our previous studies (28). Briefly, a pGEX-4T3
construct encoding for the GTPase binding domain of human Pak1
(provided by Dr. Gary Bokoch, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) was
expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein
(GST-PBD). The cells were treated with statins as indicated and lysed in
PBL. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-PBD, and bound proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against either
Rac1 or Cdc42 (purchased from BD Biosciences PharMingen) to detect
GTP-bound Rac1 or GTP-bound Cdc42, respectively.
Cell proliferation assays. Cells were seeded in flat-bottomed 96-well
plates at a final concentration of 2.5  104 per mL, in the presence or
absence of the indicated doses of statins and ATRA, and incubated at 37jC
for 4 days. Cell proliferation was assessed using a methyl thiazolyl
tetrazolium assay system as described previously (29).
Flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometric studies were done as in our
previous studies (30, 31). Briefly, NB4 cells were treated with statins and
ATRA for the indicated times. Induction of cell differentiation was
determined by flow cytometric analysis after labeling the cells with
phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse monoclonal CD11b or isotype-specific
control IgG purchased from BD Biosciences PharMingen. Apoptosis was
evaluated by propidium iodide/Annexin V staining. For the experiments in
which the effects of the JNKI peptide inhibitor on atorvastatin-induced
apoptosis were examined, the cells were preincubated for 60 min in the
absence or presence of JNKI peptide (10 Amol/L) and subsequently treated
for 48 h with atorvastatin (5 Amol/L), in the continuous presence or absence
of the JNK-inhibitory peptide. The JNK-inhibitory peptide was re-added to
the cultures at the same dose after 24 h. The induction of apoptosis was

evaluated at 48 h by flow cytometry using Annexin V/propidium iodide
staining.
Hematopoietic progenitor cell assays. Bone marrow or peripheral
blood from patients with AML were collected after obtaining informed
consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern
University. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and used for clonogenic assays in methylcellulose as in our previous
studies (28). The cells were cultured in the presence or absence of ATRA (0.5
Amol/L), fluvastatin (3 Amol/L), with the combination of these agents.
Leukemic granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) colonies
were scored on day 14 of culture.

Results
We initially examined the effects of new-generation statins on
cells of APL origin. For such experiments, we used the NB4 APL cell
line that has the t(15;17) translocation and expresses the abnormal
PML-RARafusion protein. As it has been previously reported that
lovastatin-induced apoptosis correlates with inhibition of the
MAPK kinase Mek/Erk cascade in acute leukemia (14), we initially
determined the effects of statins on the activation of different
MAPK signaling cascades in these cells. When NB4 cells were
treated with atorvastatin, there was time-dependent downregulation of phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Fig. 1A), which was
observed after prolonged treatment of the cells (24 h), but not at
earlier time points (Fig. 1A). Similar results were seen in
experiments using fluvastatin or rosuvastatin (data not shown).
Treatment of cells with different statins did not affect the
phosphorylation/activation of the p38 MAPK, indicating that this
MAPK cascade is not engaged by statins (Fig. 1B). On the other
hand, treatment of NB4 cells with atorvastatin or fluvastatin
induced phosphorylation of JNK (JNK1 and JNK2/3), although such
phosphorylation/activation was less intense than chemical stress–
induced activation (Fig. 1C). Moreover, treatment of the cells with
either atorvastatin or fluvastatin induced activation of the kinase
domain of JNK1, as evidenced in immune complex kinase
experiments using c-Jun as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 1C). In
other experiments, we determined whether different statins induce
activation of the Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases, which have been
recently shown to act as upstream effectors of lovastatin-activated
JNK in mouse macrophages (32). As shown in Fig. 1D, atorvastatin
and fluvastatin induced activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42,
strongly suggesting that these small G-proteins are activated in a
statin-inducible manner in APL cells, to regulate JNK activation.
Altogether, these studies showed that in APL cells, different statins
block activation of the Mek/Erk pathway, while they induce
activation of JNK, and such engagement is likely regulated by
upstream engagement of the small G-proteins Rac1 and Cdc42.
In subsequent studies, we evaluated the effects of atorvastatin on
the induction of apoptosis in NB4 cells. In initial experiments using
atorvastatin, we found that this statin induces apoptosis in a timeand dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Similarly, apoptosis of NB4
cells was inducible when fluvastatin was used (Fig. 2B). Importantly, such apoptosis was also observed in the variant cell lines
NB4.007/6 (Fig. 2C) and NB4.306 (Fig. 2D), which are resistant
to the effects of ATRA (33). In addition, treatment of NB4 cells
with either atorvastatin or fluvastatin resulted in PARP cleavage
(Fig. 3A), reflecting statin-dependent caspase activation. To determine whether engagement of JNK by statins is required for PARP
cleavage/induction of apoptosis, the effects of SP600125, a specific
inhibitor of JNK kinase, were determined. The induction of PARP
cleavage by either atorvastatin or fluvastatin was reversed by

pretreatment of the cells with SP600125 (Fig. 3B, (a)) and was seen
when doses of the inhibitor of either 10 or 20 Amol/L were used
(Fig. 3B, (b)). On the other hand, the pharmacologic inhibitor of
p38, SB203580, or the Mek/Erk inhibitor PD98059 had no effects on
such statin-dependent PARP cleavage (Fig. 3C). Pharmacologic
inhibition of JNK activation also reversed statin-induced apoptosis
of NB4 cells, as determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide
staining (Fig. 3D, left). To definitively establish the requirement for

JNK in the induction of statin-induced apoptosis, an approach
involving inhibition of JNK activity via use of a JNK-inhibitory
peptide (34) was employed. The induction of apoptosis in response
to atorvastatin treatment was partially blocked when cells were
treated with the cell-permeable JNK-inhibitory peptide (Fig. 3D,
right), consistent with a requirement for JNK kinase activity in this
process. Thus, activation of the JNK pathway by statins seems to
play a key role in the induction of apoptosis and PARP cleavage,

whereas the p38 and Mek/Erk pathways do not participate in the
regulation of such events.
An important mechanism by which ATRA induces antileukemic
responses in APL is the induction of granulocytic differentiation of

promyelocytes and leukemic blasts (35–37). We examined whether
statins can induce differentiation of leukemia cells of promyelocytic origin. Treatment of NB4 cells with either atorvastatin or
fluvastatin induced differentiation of NB4 cells, evidenced by the

induction of expression of the CD11b marker (Fig. 4A). Moreover,
combinations of either atorvastatin or fluvastatin with low
concentrations of ATRA resulted in high numbers of CD11bpositive cells (Fig. 4A), consistent with a strong induction of cell
differentiation by such combinations.
When similar studies were done in the retinoid-resistant NB4
variants NB4 007.6 and NB4.306, we found that either atorvastatin

or fluvastatin (Fig. 4B and C) had dramatic effects on the ATRAresistant lines and reversed the resistance that these cells exhibit to
the differentiating effects of ATRA (Fig. 4B and C). Two-tailed
paired t test analysis showed that the combination of ATRA +
atorvastatin or ATRA + fluvastatin induced significant leukemic
differentiation compared with ATRA in both NB4.007/6 and
NB4.306 cells (Fig. 4B and C). We also examined the effects of

treated) cells.

statins on leukemic blasts obtained from an ATRA-resistant case.
In these primary leukemic blasts, neither ATRA nor statins induced
significant cell differentiation (Fig. 4D, left). However, combinations
of atorvastatin or fluvastatin with ATRA resulted in induction of
leukemic cell differentiation (Fig. 4D, left), further establishing that
statins are capable of reversing retinoid resistance in APL. The
effects of either fluvastatin or atorvastatin in reversing RA
resistance were dose dependent, and at higher final concentrations
(5 Amol/L), the ability of statins to reverse ATRA resistance was
remarkably enhanced (Fig. 4D, right).
In other studies, we determined whether statins exhibit growthinhibitory effects on RA-resistant cells. In methyl thiazolyl
tetrazolium assays, we found that statins inhibited the growth of
ATRA-sensitive NB4 cells in a dose-dependent manner (data not
shown). Importantly, both atorvastatin and fluvastatin blocked the
growth of the ATRA-resistant NB4.007/6 and NB4. 306 variant cell
lines, both of which were refractory to the growth-inhibitory effects
of ATRA (Fig. 5). Combinations of statins with ATRA also resulted
in substantial growth inhibition of the ATRA-resistant cell lines
(Fig. 5). Thus, in addition to promoting ATRA-dependent cell
differentiation of retinoid-resistant cells, statins exhibit growthinhibitory effects on such cells. To examine whether statins exhibit
growth-inhibitory effects on AML primary leukemic progenitors
from non-APL subtypes of AML, we did clonogenic assays in
methylcellulose using hematopoietic progenitors obtained from the

suppression of leukemic progenitor cell growth (Fig. 6A). To obtain
information on the potential mechanisms by which statins inhibit
the growth of AML cells, we examined their effects on the
expression of the p21WAF1/Cip1 protein. There is previous evidence
that up-regulation of the p21WAF1 protein is involved in the generation of the growth-inhibitory effects of retinoids (38), whereas
recent studies have shown that mevastatin induces its expression
in colon cancer cells to regulate inhibition of cell growth (39). Both
statins up-regulated p21 protein expression, and such effects were
detectable after 24 or 48 h of treatment (Fig. 6B and C), suggesting
the existence of a mechanism for the generation of statindependent growth-inhibitory responses in leukemic progenitors.

Discussion
The introduction of statins in clinical medicine has been a major
breakthrough that has changed the natural history of coronary
artery disease in humans. A large body of evidence has also
suggested that statins are inducers of apoptosis and growth
inhibition of different types of malignant cells, whereas they also
exhibit anti-invasive and radiosensitizing activities (11, 40). Earlygeneration statins, such as lovastatin, have been shown to induce
apoptosis and/or growth inhibition of malignant cells, including
cells of leukemic origin (11–22, 41–43). There is also evidence for
statin-dependent differentiation of osteoblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells (23, 24, 44, 45), whereas lovastatin has been
shown to induce differentiation of some leukemic cell lines in vitro,
including NB4 cells (46). The ability of statins to suppress growth
and induce apoptosis of leukemia cells in vitro has raised the
prospect that these agents may exhibit antileukemic properties

in vivo when used at doses higher than the standard cholesterolreducing doses. In fact, when used at a high dose, lovastatin was
found to suppress blast cell growth in vivo in an elderly patient
with AML (47). In addition, a recent phase I study in which pravastatin was combined with idarubicin and high-dose 1-h-Darabinofuranosylcytosine showed tolerable toxicity at very high
doses of pravastatin (1,280 mg/d), whereas the maximum tolerated
doses had not been reached at the time of the report (48).
Importantly, this preliminary report showed higher response rates
for both newly diagnosed patients with poor prognosis and for
salvage patients, compared with historical controls, providing the
basis for future phase II studies (48).
Although there is accumulating evidence that different statins
exhibit antileukemic properties in vitro and in vivo, very little is
known on the antileukemic effects of statins in APL. APL is a

distinct subtype of AML, also known as AML-M3 (49), with
different clinical behavior than other acute leukemias. The
hallmark of APL is the presence of the t(15;17) chromosomal
translocation and the ability of ATRA to induce granulocytic
differentiation of the leukemic blasts (49). The t(15;17) translocation results in the abnormal fusion of the RA receptor a (RARa)
gene with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene, whose product
is the abnormal PML-RARafusion protein (49). In contrast to other
AML-subtypes, APL blasts are highly sensitive to the differentiating
effects of retinoids (ATRA) in vitro and in vivo, and the introduction of ATRA in the treatment of APL has dramatically improved
the outcome of such patients (36). It is of particular interest that
when ATRA is given as a single agent, the vast majority of APL
patients obtain complete responses (36). However, most of these
patients eventually relapse, consistent with the development of
ATRA resistance by the leukemic cells (21).
In the present study, we examined the effects of new-generation
statins on cells of APL origin. Our data show that atorvastatin,
fluvastatin, and/or rosuvastatin inhibit the MEK/Erk pathway and
activate the Rac1/Cdc42/JNK kinase cascade in NB4 cells. Different
statins were capable of inducing leukemic cell differentiation of
ATRA-sensitive NB4 cells, whereas combinations of statins with
low doses of ATRA resulted in enhanced cell differentiation.
Remarkably, atorvastatin and fluvastatin were found to induce
apoptosis and cell differentiation of two NB4 variant cell lines
(NB4.007/6 or NB4.306) that are refractory to the antileukemic
properties of ATRA. In addition, combinations of ATRA with
atorvastatin or fluvastatin were more effective in inducing
differentiation of either NB4.007/6 or NB4.306 cells, indicating that
statins reverse the ATRA resistance that these cells exhibit. This
was further established in experiments showing reversal of
resistance of primary leukemic blasts to ATRA-induced differentiation and enhancement of sensitivity of primary AML bone
marrow progenitors to the inhibitory effects of ATRA. Thus, statins
are capable of inducing both apoptosis and cell differentiation of
leukemic blasts, as in the case of arsenic trioxide, a heavy metal
derivative with significant clinical activity in APL (50). The precise
contributions of apoptosis versus cell differentiation in the
antileukemic effects of statins and their ability to reverse ATRA
resistance remains to be established, but it is likely that both
processes contribute to such effects. It should be also noted that as
ATRA is not a useful agent in the treatment of non-APL cases of
AML, the ability of statins to promote its antileukemic effects in
such cells is of particular interest. Combinations of statins with
ATRA may be an approach to restore ATRA sensitivity in vitro and
possibly in vivo in non-APL cases of AML, and this remains to be
determined in future studies.
Our studies also establish that the JNK/MAPK pathway is
activated during treatment of APL cells with statins, and that
inhibition of such JNK kinase activation reverses statin-dependent
apoptosis. In addition, the upstream regulators of the JNK pathway,
small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, are activated in a statin-inducible
manner, suggesting a potential mechanism by which statins
regulate downstream activation of JNK. Although the precise
sequence of events that result in activation of JNK in leukemia cells
remain to defined, it seems that this MAPK cascade plays a key and
specific role in the generation of the effects of statins, as the two
other major MAPK cascades are either not activated (p38; current
report) and/or are inhibited (Mek/Erk; ref. 14 and current report)
by statins. Independently of the precise cellular mechanisms
involved, our data show that APL cells are particularly sensitive to

the differentiating and proapoptotic effects of atorvastatin and
fluvastatin, and that they maintain such a response even after the
development of retinoid resistance. Combinations of statins with
ATRA may prove to be an effective approach for the treatment of
APL patients that develop ATRA resistance. Incorporating a statin
in the treatment schema may prevent development of such
resistance, and, based on our data, future clinical translational
efforts to address this issue are warranted.
