Akt3-Mediated Resistance to Apoptosis in B-RAF–Targeted
Melanoma Cells
Yongping Shao and Andrew E. Aplin

Abstract
Melanoma cells are highly resistant to anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced in nonadherent/inappropriate adhesion conditions. Depleting B-RAF or the prosurvival Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 renders mutant BRAF melanoma cells susceptible to anoikis. In this study, we examined the effect of targeting B-RAF on
the survival of primary stage melanoma cells cultured in three-dimensional type I collagen gels, which
partially mimics the dermal microenvironment. Depletion/inhibition of B-RAF with small interfering
RNA or the mutant B-RAF inhibitor, PLX4720, induced apoptosis of mutant B-RAF melanoma cells in
three-dimensional collagen. Apoptosis was dependent on two upregulated BH3-only proteins, Bim-EL
and Bmf, and was inhibited by ectopic Mcl-1 expression. Akt3 activation has been associated with the
survival of melanoma cells. Mutant B-RAF melanoma cells ectopically expressing a constitutively activated
form of Akt3 or endogenously expressing mutant Akt3 were protected from apoptosis induced by B-RAF
knockdown or PLX4720 treatment. Furthermore, intrinsically resistant metastatic melanoma cells displayed
elevated Akt phosphorylation in three-dimensional collagen and were rendered susceptible to PLX4720 by
Akt3 knockdown. Importantly, myristylated Akt3 prevented B-RAF targeting–induced upregulation of BimEL and Bmf in three-dimensional collagen and partially protected Mcl-1–depleted cells from apoptosis.
These findings delineate how mutant B-RAF protects melanoma cells from apoptosis and provide insight
into possible resistance mechanisms to B-RAF inhibitors. Cancer Res; 70(16); 6670–81. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and its incidence is on the rise. It is treatable by surgical excision when
detected at a noninvasive radial growth phase (RGP) stage.
However, during the vertical growth phase (VGP), it invades
through the basement membrane and into the dermis. Two
major issues thwarting the efficacy of melanoma treatments
are the propensity of VGP cells to metastasize from the dermis and resistance to chemotherapeutic regimens.
A significant advance in understanding the biology of
melanoma was the identification of B-RAF mutations in
∼60% of these tumors (1). B-RAF is a serine-threonine
kinase that activates the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK
1/2 pathway. The most frequent mutation in B-RAF is a
valine to glutamate substitution at codon 600 (V600E),
which results in B-RAF activation and occurs early in

the disease. The downstream MEK-ERK1/2 pathway is
activated in melanomas (2, 3) and is required for the proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and invasion of mutant
B-RAF melanoma cells (4–6). These findings have focused
efforts on the development of inhibitors to target B-RAF in
melanoma. Recently, a structure-guided approach led to
the generation of PLX4720, a drug that binds near the
ATP-binding site in B-RAF and exhibits a 10-fold lower
IC50 toward B-RAFV600E compared with wild-type B-RAF
(7). In an early-stage clinical trial, PLX4032, a structural
analogue of PLX4720, showed strong antitumor effects in
patients genotyped as harboring mutant B-RAF (8). However, the majority of patients administered with PLX4032 exhibit a partial response. In addition, B-RAF and MEK
inhibitors in preclinical assays typically elicit a cytostatic
response (4, 7, 9). These findings indicate that it will be
critical to promote cytotoxic effects in B-RAF–targeted tumors to obtain prolonged tumor regression in patients.
A crucial step in tumor progression is the acquisition of
resistance to anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by loss
of adhesion or inappropriate adhesion to the extracellular
matrix (ECM; ref. 10). The ability of melanoma cells to
counteract anoikis is critical as they move out from the
epidermis, invade the type I collagen-rich dermis, survive
in the circulatory system, and eventually establish metastatic colonies. We and others have shown that human
melanocytes are susceptible to anoikis, whereas mutant
B-RAF harboring VGP melanoma cells are resistant (11,
12). B-RAF signaling is implicated in the resistance of

Melanoma Cell Apoptosis Mechanisms in Three Dimensions

VGP melanoma cells because B-RAF depletion or MEK inhibition renders invasive cells susceptible to anoikis (12,
13). These effects were associated with enhanced expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein, B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting mediator extra long isoform (Bim-EL),
and decreased levels of the prosurvival protein, myeloid
cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1; refs. 13, 14).
Integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM component, fibronectin, protects B-RAF knockdown melanoma cells from undergoing apoptosis (12). Fibronectin is a minor component
of the dermis (15) and is deposited at premetastatic niches
(16). Furthermore, fibronectin binding integrins, αvβ3 and
α4β1, are highly expressed in melanoma cells (17), and use
of peptides to block cell binding to fibronectin prevents melanoma cell growth in mouse models (18). The mechanism of
fibronectin-dependent protection from apoptosis is mediated, at least in part, through activation of Akt (12). Of the
three Akt isoforms, Akt3 likely plays a key role because it is
the predominately activated Akt isoform in melanoma cells,
and knockdown of Akt3 cooperates with B-RAF knockdown
to promote apoptosis (19, 20).
It will be critical to understand how to maximize the therapeutic effects of targeting B-RAF. To this end, we used inhibitor and RNA interference approaches to target B-RAF in
mutant B-RAF melanoma cells. Analysis was done on RGP or
VGP-like cells in three-dimensional collagen to more accurately recapitulate the dermal microenvironment. We show
that targeting B-RAF induces apoptosis in three-dimensional
collagen that is controlled by levels of the BH3-only proteins,
Bim-EL and Bcl-2-modifying factor (Bmf), and the prosurvival protein Mcl-1. Constitutive activation of Akt3 protects
against B-RAF knockdown/inhibition, prevents the upregulation of Bim-EL and Bmf, and partially protects melanoma
cells from Mcl-1 depletion. Together, these findings delineate
mutant B-RAF–dependent survival mechanisms in tumor
cells and provide insight into possible modes of resistance
to B-RAF inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human WM793, WM35, WM278, WM46, and 1205Lu cells
were generously provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar
Institute, Philadelphia, PA) during the time period 2004 to
2009; A375 cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection. In all cases, early passage cultures were
stored and used for the basis of these experiments. All cells
were cultured in MCDB153 (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 20%
Leibovitz L-15 medium, 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
5 μg/mL insulin, except A375 cells that were cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS. WM793 and WM278 are VGP-like;
WM35 display RGP properties; WM46, A375, and 1205Lu
are metastatic lines.
Antibodies
The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: anti-pan Akt (#9227), anti-Akt3 (#4059),
anti–phospho-Akt (Ser473, #9271), anti–phospho-(Ser/Thr)

Akt substrate (#9611), anti–phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204,
#4377), anti-HA (#2367), and anti–phospho-GSK3β (Ser9,
#9336). Anti–Mcl-1 (#559027) and anti-GSK3β (#610201) were
from BD Transduction. Anti-actin (#A2066) was from SigmaAldrich. Anti-Bim (#AAP-330) was from Stressgen.
Western blotting
Western blotting was done as previously described (12).
Briefly, cells were washed and lysed directly in Laemmli sample buffer. Lysates were separated on SDS polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
Proteins were detected using the indicated primary antibody,
and the signal was detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by development using chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was
detected using a Versadoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad) and
was quantitated using the Quantity-One software.
Small interfering RNA transfections
WM793 cells were transfected with small interfering RNAs
(siRNA) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as previously described (12). Nontargeting control, B-RAF #1, Mcl-1 #11,
Bmf #7, and Akt3 siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon.
Bim siRNA were from Cell Signaling Technology (13). All
siRNAs were used at a final concentration of 25 nmol/L. Cells
were transfected for 72 hours before subsequent treatment
or analysis.
Generation of lentiviruses and cell lines
Wild-type Akt3 and NH2-terminal myristylated Akt3 were
amplified from human Akt3 cDNA plasmid (Addgene) using
the KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase kit (Novagen). The
primer set for wild-type Akt3 was as follows: forward 5′
caccatgtacgcctacgacgtgcccg 3′ and reverse 5′ ttattctcgtccacttgcagagtagg 3′. Myr-HA-AKT3 was amplified in the
same way except that forward primer 5′-caccatggggagcagcaagag-3′ was used in the PCR reaction. In both constructs,
the HA epitope tag was retained. Akt fragments were then
cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer's guidelines. Entry plasmids were recombined with pLenti6/UbC/V5-DEST using the LR Clonase II kit and protocol (Invitrogen) to generate pLenti6/
UbC/HA-AKT3 and pLenti6/UbC/Myr-HA-AKT3. Constructs
were verified by DNA sequencing. Lentiviruses were generated as described before (13) using the ViraPower Lentiviral
Gateway Expression kit (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated
for 72 hours in the presence of lentiviral supernatant.
Transduced cell populations were selected with 5 μg/mL
blasticidin.
Wild-type Mcl-1 cDNA sequence was PCR amplified from
human Mcl-1 cDNA kindly provided by Dr. Steven Edwards
(University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; ref. 21)
using the KOD hot Start DNA polymerase kit and the primers
5′-caccatgtttggcctcaaaagaaccg-3′ and 5′-ctatcttattagatatgcc3′. DNA fragment was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector,
and the entry plasmid was then recombined with pLenti4/
TO/V5-DEST to form destination plasmid pLenti4/TO/Mcl-1.

ref. 13) were infected with lentivirus for 72 hours before
selection with 25 μg/mL zeocin.
Three-dimensional collagen gels
Collagen gels were cast by mixing the following on ice:
Eagle's MEM (Lonza, Inc.), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 2% FBS,
0.15% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.8 mg/mL bovine type-I
collagen (Organogenesis, Inc.). Cells were seeded in 2 mL
collagen gels and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. After
polymerization, the collagen gel lattice was overlaid with
2 mL medium.
Apoptosis assays
Three-dimensional collagen gels were dissolved in 1 mg/mL
collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) solution to release cells. Adherent cells in two-dimensional cell cultures were trypsinized. Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in
100 μL binding buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES, 140 mmol/L sodium chloride, 2.5 mmol/L calcium chloride) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Cells were then stained with 5 μL
Annexin V-APC (BD Biosciences) for 15 minutes before
400 μL binding buffer was added. Staining was measured by
flow cytometry on the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and
data were analyzed using Flowjo software (Three Star, Inc.).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from melanoma cells by using
the 5 Prime Perfect Pure RNA isolation kit (5 Prime, Inc.).
RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed, and 1 of 20 of the resulting cDNA was used to detect mRNA abundance with primers
for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′tggaccaccaactgcttag-3′; reverse, 5′-gatgcagggatgatgttc-3′),
Bim-EL (forward, 5′-tccctgctgtctcgatcctc-3′; reverse,
5′-gctcttcggctgcttggtaa-3′), and Bmf (forward, 5′-gaggtacagattgcccgaaag-3′; reverse, 5′-ttcaaagcaaggttgtgca-3′). Reactions were done in SYBR Green mix and analyzed using the
MyiQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Relative
mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative Ct
(ΔCt) method. Quantitation of mRNA levels represents data
from three independent experiments.

Results
Targeting B-RAF renders mutant B-RAF melanoma cells
susceptible to apoptosis in three-dimensional collagen
We have previously shown that B-RAF knockdown renders the B-RAFV600E melanoma WM793 cells susceptible to
apoptosis in suspension (12). Here, we tested the mutantselective B-RAF inhibitor, PLX4720, in similar assays. The
effectiveness of PLX4720 to inhibit B-RAF signaling in
WM793 cells was manifested by its rapid and persistent
inhibition of phosphoERK1/2 levels (Fig. 1A). Similar to
our previous results with B-RAF knockdown, PLX4720
treatment increased Annexin V staining in suspended
but not in fibronectin-adherent cells (Fig. 1B, quantitated
in C). WM793 display properties of VGP, and to more
faithfully recapitulate signaling in the dermal microenvironment, we extended our studies to three-dimensional

type-I collagen gels. WM793 cells transfected with control
siRNAs and subsequently cultured in three-dimensional
collagen displayed low levels of Annexin V staining
(Fig. 1D). By contrast, B-RAF knockdown or PLX4720treated WM793 cells in three-dimensional collagen displayed enhanced Annexin V staining. We have previously
observed similar results between Annexin V and cleaved
caspase-3 staining, indicating activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (14). These data show that mutant B-RAF
is required for the protection of melanoma cells in
suspension and three-dimensional collagen conditions.
WM793 cells express collagen receptors including the α1
and α2 integrins (12), and α2β1 mediates cell arrest in
fibrillar collagen gels in some melanoma lines (22). However, efficient knockdown of α1 and α2 integrins did not
alter PLX4720-induced apoptosis in WM793 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that these integrins are not
required for the apoptosis mediated by B-RAF inhibition.
Upregulation of Bim-EL and Bmf contributes to
apoptosis in three-dimensional collagen following
B-RAF targeting
BH3-only proteins, such as Bim-EL and Bmf, are upregulated following B-RAF knockdown or MEK inhibition in
two-dimensional monolayer cultures of melanoma cells
(13, 23–25). Initially, we validated that the upregulation
of Bim-EL and Bmf following B-RAF knockdown was efficiently prevented by siRNAs targeting either Bim or Bmf
(Fig. 2A). Of note, we used quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) to detect Bmf due to the unavailability of a commercial antibody that detects a specific
endogenous Bmf band, an observation consistent with
Schmelzle and colleagues (26). Next, we addressed the
contribution of Bim-EL and Bmf to apoptosis in B-RAF–
depleted cells in three-dimensional collagen. Bim-EL depletion partially prevented apoptosis in B-RAF knockdown
and PLX4720-treated WM793 cells in three-dimensional
collagen (Fig. 2B). Similarly, Bmf depletion was effective
at preventing apoptosis in B-RAF knockdown and
PLX4720-treated cells. Furthermore, Bim-EL and Bmf coknockdown was more effective than either individual
knockdown at preventing apoptosis in PLX4720-treated
cells (Fig. 2B). These data show that both Bim-EL and
Bmf are required for the apoptosis of B-RAF–targeted cells
in three-dimensional collagen.
Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 protects against PLX4720induced apoptosis in three dimension
BH3-only proteins act, at least in part, by inhibiting prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins (27, 28). We have previously shown
that B-RAF-MEK signaling enhanced protein stability of the
prosurvival protein, Mcl-1 (14). To determine whether enhanced Mcl-1 expression was sufficient to confer resistance
to apoptosis in B-RAF–targeted cells, we engineered an
inducible Mcl-1 expression cell line. Following doxycycline
treatment, enhanced expression of Mcl-1 was detected in
nontreated and PLX4720-treated cells (Fig. 2C). Importantly,
enhanced Mcl-1 expression protected WM793 cells from

apoptosis induced by PLX4720 treatment in threedimensional collagen (Fig. 2D). Mcl-1 also protected cells
from apoptosis induced by MEK inhibition with U0126
(data not shown).
Constitutive activation of Akt3 protects against
B-RAF inhibition
Adhesion to fibronectin, but not to collagen, enhances
levels of phospho-Akt in WM793 cells (12), and Akt3 is
the main Akt isoform activated in melanoma cells (19).
Thus, we determined whether constitutive activation of
Akt3 was able to protect B-RAF–targeted WM793 cells
against apoptosis in three-dimensional collagen. Addition
of the myristylation signal of the c-Src kinase to the
NH2 terminus of Akt3 strongly enhances Akt3 activation
and transforming activity in fibroblast focus–forming assays (29). We generated wild-type and myristylated human
Akt3 lentiviruses and, subsequently, WM793 cell populations that stably express the Akt3 transgenes. Expression
was confirmed by Western blotting with Akt and epitopetag antibodies (Fig. 3A). Myristylated Akt3 but not wildtype Akt3 led to increased levels of phospho-Akt. Next,
we determined the effect of adhesion on Akt signaling
in the ectopic Akt-expressing cell populations. Although
activation of endogenous Akt and wild-type Akt3 was
adhesion dependent, myristylated Akt3 activity was
constitutive and adhesion independent, as indicated by
phospho-Akt staining (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, myristylated
Akt3 enhanced phosphorylation of GSK-3β, an Akt substrate, and levels of a prominent staining band detected
by a phospho-Akt substrate antibody. To determine the
effect of constitutive Akt3 signaling on B-RAF–targeted
cells, we knocked down B-RAF in Akt3-expressing cell
lines. By Annexin V staining, expression of myristylated
Akt3 partially protected B-RAF knockdown cells from apoptosis in three-dimensional collagen, whereas wild-type
Akt3 was not protective (Fig. 3C). Similarly, expression
of myristylated Akt3 but not wild-type Akt3 protected
WM793 cells in three-dimensional collagen gels from
PLX4720-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3D). Notably, expression
of myristylated Akt3 did not enhance phospho-ERK1/2
in B-RAF knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To determine the generality of these effects, we expressed
myristylated Akt3 in other mutant B-RAF–harboring melanoma cells. WM35 and WM278 cells are B-RAFV600E expressing and representative of RGP and VGP, respectively. Both
Bim-EL and Bmf were upregulated by PLX4720 in these
cells (data not shown). Western blotting confirmed that
myristylated Akt3 was highly active, and that PLX4720 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in WM35 cells (Fig. 4A).
Importantly, expression of myristylated Akt3 protected
WM35 cells from apoptosis induced by PLX4720 in threedimensional collagen (Fig. 4B). Similarly, myristylated
Akt3-transduced WM278 cells displayed enhanced phosphoAkt, and PLX4720 inhibited ERK1/2 in these cells
(Fig. 4C). WM278 cells were more sensitive to PLX4720
treatment compared with WM793 cells, but myristylated

www.aacrjournals.org

Akt3-WM278 cells still exhibited resistance to PLX4720induced apoptosis in three-dimensional collagen (Fig. 4D).
Together, these data show that constitutive activation of
Akt3 protects B-RAF–targeted primary stage melanoma
cells from apoptosis.
PLX4720-resistant cell lines display elevated Akt
phosphorylation in three-dimensional collagen
A small percentage of melanoma lines harbor Akt3 mutations (30). One identified Akt3 mutant line is WM46, which
harbors an E17K mutation that enhances Akt association
with the plasma membrane and increases Akt kinase activity (31). WM46 displayed enhanced Akt phosphorylation in
three-dimensional collagen and resistance to PLX4720induced apoptosis (Fig. 5A). Even treatment with high concentrations of PLX4720 (5–10 μmol/L) were unable to
promote substantial apoptosis in WM46 cells. During our
studies, we identified two metastatic lines, A375 and
1205Lu, which were de novo resistant to PLX4720-induced
apoptosis in three-dimensional collagen (Fig. 5B). Both
A375 and 1205Lu displayed enhanced Akt phosphorylation
in three dimension compared with the sensitive lines
WM35 and WM278. Furthermore, knockdown of Akt3 rendered 1205Lu cells sensitive to PLX4720-induced apoptosis
in three dimensions (Fig. 5C). These data further associate
elevated Akt phosphorylation with resistance to PLX4720.
Myristylated Akt3 prevents upregulation of Bim-EL and
Bmf mRNA following B-RAF inhibition
Next, we examined the effect of Akt3 signaling on the
induction of Bim-EL and Bmf following B-RAF knockdown
and PLX4720 treatment in three-dimensional collagen. Total RNA was extracted from WM793 cells in collagen gels
and analyzed by qRT-PCR. As expected, Bim-EL and Bmf
mRNA levels were increased in three dimensions following
B-RAF knockdown (Fig. 6A and B). In cells expressing myristylated Akt3, the upregulation of both Bim-EL and Bmf
was inhibited. Similarly, treatment with PLX4720 in
WM793 cells in three dimensions led to the upregulation
of Bim-EL and Bmf, which was inhibited in cells expressing myristylated Akt3 (Fig. 6A and B). Thus, the protective
effect of myristylated Akt3 in B-RAF–targeted cells is
associated with an impaired upregulation of Bim-EL and
Bmf mRNA.
Activated Akt3 promotes cell survival in Mcl-1–
depleted melanoma cells in three dimension
We have previously shown that downregulation of Mcl-1
renders melanoma cells susceptible to apoptosis in suspension (14). Extending these observations to three dimensions, efficient downregulation of Mcl-1 promoted
apoptosis in collagen gels (Fig. 6C and D). If Akt3 protective effects were mediated through Bim-EL and Bmf, we
would predict that myristylated Akt3 would elicit protective effects in Mcl-1 knockdown cells. Expression of myristylated Akt3 but not wild-type Akt3 was sufficient to
protect Mcl-1 knockdown cells from apoptosis (Fig. 6D).

Notably, the protection was not as complete as effects elicited by myristylated Akt3 in PLX4720-treated cells; nevertheless, these data suggest that Akt3 signaling regulates
apoptotic signaling events, at least in part, through
Bim-EL and Bmf.

Discussion
The identification of B-RAF mutations in melanoma, and
to a lesser extent in thyroid carcinoma, colorectal cancer,
and ovarian cancer, has focused efforts on targeted therapeutic strategies to treat these malignancies. Here, we have used
inhibitor and RNA interference approaches to determine the
effect of targeting B-RAF in primary stage melanoma cells
cultured in three-dimensional dermal-like matrices. It is critical to test the importance of tumor cell signaling pathways
in ECM microenvironments that more closely resemble the
in vivo situation compared with two-dimensional cultures.
Other groups have shown that Rho GTPase activity and focal
adhesion kinase signaling differ between three-dimensional

and two-dimensional conditions (32, 33). Furthermore, the
three-dimensional environment also controls cellular differentiation (34) and has been used in breast and prostate cancer progression models (35, 36).
Initially, our study shows that either B-RAF depletion or
treatment with the recently described mutant-selective BRAF inhibitor (7), PLX4720, promotes apoptosis in threedimensional collagen gels. The effects that we observe are
similar to the susceptibility of B-RAF–targeted cells to apoptosis in suspension conditions (13). Although primary stage
cell lines used in this study are sensitive to PLX4720-induced
apoptosis, some metastatic lines displayed elevated Akt
phosphorylation in three-dimensional and were less susceptible. Addition of fibronectin to three-dimensional collagen
gels elicited partial protection to PLX4720-induced apoptosis
in WM35 cells, and low level of protection was observed in
two other susceptible cell lines (data not shown). The effects
may not be as dramatic as in two-dimension due to inefficient remodeling of fibronectin or lower stiffness of the
three-dimensional system.

collagen gels with or without PLX4720 (1, 5, and 10 μmol/L, as indicated). Cells were lysed after 24 h for Western blot analysis for phosphoS473 Akt,
phospho ERK1/2, and actin (left). WM46 cells were analyzed after 48 h for Annexin V staining (right). B, A375 and 1205Lu cells were seeded into
three-dimensional collagen gels. Left, Annexin V staining following 48-h treatment with 5 μmol/L PLX4720. Right, Western blot analysis for phosphoS473

with control nontargeting or Akt3 siRNAs for 72 h. Cells were lysed for Western blot analysis for phosphoS473 Akt, Akt3, and actin (left). Cells were
seeded in three-dimensional collagen gels with or without 5 μmol/L PLX4720. After 48 h, cells were harvested for Annexin V staining and flow cytometry
analysis (right).

Enhanced apoptosis in B-RAF–targeted cells in three dimensions was dependent on the BH3-only proteins Bim-EL
and Bmf. We and others have previously shown that BimEL is upregulated following B-RAF knockdown or MEK inhibition in melanoma cells and sensitizes melanoma cells to

anoikis (13, 23, 24). Upregulation of Bim-EL occurs through
mRNA regulation and protein stability mechanisms (13).
Others have suggested that cytosolic accumulation of Bmf
correlates with apoptotic sensitivity to MEK inhibition (25);
however, the effect of altered Bmf expression in melanoma

Figure 6. Myristylated Akt3 counteracts the upregulation of BH3-only proteins and protects against Mcl-1 knockdown–induced apoptosis in three
dimensions. A, WM793 and WM793 Myr-HA-Akt3 cells were transfected with either control or B-RAF siRNAs for 72 h. Cells were then seeded in
three-dimensional collagen gels and cultured in serum-free medium. After 24 h, cells were harvested for total RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis.
Additionally, WM793 and WM793 Myr-HA-Akt3 cells were treated with 0.5 μmol/L PLX4720 for 40 h before harvesting cells. Quantitation of data from three

cells remains unclear. In our studies, Bmf mRNA levels were
upregulated following B-RAF knockdown. These findings are
consistent with recent microarray analyses (37). We were unable to verify the specificity of commercial Bmf antibodies,
similar to concerns raised by other laboratories (26). Although both Bim-EL and Bmf mRNA levels are upregulated
by loss of adhesion in epithelial and fibroblast cells (26, 38,
39), Bim-EL and Bmf mRNA levels were not adhesion regulated in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells (data not shown).
Bmf was originally identified in a screen as a binding partner
for Mcl-1 (40), and ERK1/2 activity regulates Mcl-1 protein
stability in melanoma cells (14). We show that enhanced
expression of Mcl-1 provides melanoma cells with resistance
to PLX4720-induced apoptosis. Mcl-1 expression in melanoma may underlie resistance to several distinct types of
proapoptotic signals including resistance to dacarbazine
treatment (41), exposure to ionizing radiation (42), the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (43), and endoplasmic reticulum stress (44). These findings suggest that BH3 mimetics
that target Mcl-1 may prove therapeutically useful in the
treatment of melanoma.
Adhesion of melanoma cells to fibronectin but not type I
collagen activates Akt, an effect observed even in PTENdeficient cells such as WM793 (12). Akt3 is the main Akt
isoform activated in melanoma (19), and we show that ectopically expressed myristylated Akt3 signals in an adhesionindependent manner. Furthermore, constitutive Akt3 activity
rendered melanoma cells resistant to B-RAF targeting
through either B-RAF knockdown or PLX4720 treatment.
Akt3 actions are, at least in part, mediated through preventing the upregulation of Bim-EL and Bmf induced by B-RAF
inhibition. Others have implicated activated Akt in the suppression of Bim-EL and Bmf in nonmelanoma cell types (26,
45), and these findings indicate that other Akt isoforms may
elicit similar effects. We have not yet identified the downstream effectors of Akt3 that mediate effects on Bim-EL
and Bmf; however, based on others findings mammalian target of rapamycin, PRAS40 and GSK-3β are likely mediators

(46–48). Similar to B-RAF knockdown/inhibition, depletion
of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 renders melanoma cells
susceptible to apoptosis in three dimension. Mcl-1 knockdown–induced apoptosis was protected by the expression
of myristylated Akt3; however, the effect was partial, suggesting that additional pathways may be involved.
In summary, we show that constitutive, adhesion-independent
Akt3 activity confers resistance to melanoma cell apoptosis induced by B-RAF targeting in three dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of combinatorial targeting of both the
B-RAF-MEK and integrin-PI-3 kinase-Akt signaling pathways to
elicit cytotoxic effects. Dual targeting of these two pathways inhibits melanoma tumors in xenografts and causes tumor regression of B-RAFV600E/loss of PTEN-induced melanomas in mouse
models (20, 46, 49). Furthermore, overexpression of activated
Akt1 enhances the tumor-forming ability of the nontumorigenic
cell line WM35 (50). A small percentage of melanoma cells harbor
Akt3 mutations (30); nevertheless, mutations in Akt3 or other
components of this pathway represent possible mechanisms of
de novo and/or acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors.
