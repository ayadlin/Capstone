Abstract

Author Manuscript

The 40S ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is an important regulator of cell growth. Expression of
S6K1 is often elevated in breast cancer cells. However, the transcriptional mechanism of S6K1
overexpression is not understood. In this report, we demonstrate that estrogen activates expression
of S6K1 via Estrogen Receptor (ER) α in ER-positive breast cancer cells. We also show that
estrogen acts on the proximal promoter of the S6K1 gene in a mechanism involving the
transcriptional factor GATA-3. Finally, we provide data that support the importance of estrogenic
regulation of S6K1 expression in breast cancer cell proliferation. S6K1 directly phosphorylates
and regulates ligand-independent activity of ERα, while ERα upregulates S6K1 expression. This
S6K1-ERα relationship creates a positive feed-forward loop in control of breast cancer cell
proliferation. Furthermore, the co-dependent association between S6K1 and ERα may be
exploited in the development of targeted breast cancer therapies.

Introduction
The 40S Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) is a key regulator of cell size control and cell
proliferation downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [1, 2]. The
activation of S6K1 by mTOR occurs in response to cellular energy status, nutrient levels,
and mitogens. Full and sustained S6K activation requires multiple phosphorylation events

by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent and -independent mechanisms [3].
Treatment with rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), results in
rapid dephosphorylation and inactivation of S6K1 [4]. Results from S6k1 mouse knockouts
uncovered a specific role for S6K1 in regulation of cell growth [5]. S6K1 has been shown to
drive the G1/S cell cycle progression, and overexpression of S6K1 provides a significant
proliferative advantage in low serum conditions [1, 6, 7]. The study of cellular targets and
interacting partners of S6K1 revealed a repertoire of proteins involved in transcription
(CREMτ, UBF-1, and ERα), RNA processing (SKAR), protein translation (rpS6, eIF3,
eIF4B, eEF2K, and PDCD4), survival (Bad and MDM2), and signaling feedback (IRS-1,
mTOR, and rictor), [reviewed in 2].

The RPS6KB1 gene is located in the 17q23 genomic region. 17q23 amplifications in breast
cancer cause increased copy number of the RPS6KB1 gene, resulting in elevated S6K1
expression [7–13]. While amplification of this region has been observed in several tumor
types, high copy number amplification occurs in breast cancer specifically [12].
Furthermore, RPS6KB1 amplification and S6K1 overexpression are associated with poor
prognosis in breast cancer patients, supporting the role of S6K1 in disease development
and/or progression [9, 14].
Clinically, up to 60% of breast cancers are Estrogen Receptor (ER)-positive. ER-positive
breast cancers can be targeted therapeutically by antiestrogens (such as tamoxifen) or
aromatase inhibitors. However, only about half of ER-positive breast cancers respond to
endocrine treatments [15], and resistance frequently develops [16]. Thus, an important
clinical strategy is to use a combination therapy approach with inhibitors of other signaling
pathways, and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.

Author Manuscript

Targeting S6K1 may be a feasible strategy for the following reasons. First, 17q23
amplification strongly correlates with ER-positive status [13], and is one of the most
frequent aberrations in ER-positive invasive ductal carcinoma [17]. Second, RPS6KB1 was
determined to be a gene whose gain in ER-positive tumors is prognostic of the metastatic
capacity of human breast cancer [18]. Third, RPS6KB1 amplification and S6K1
overexpression in ER-driven breast cancers may stem from its involvement in ERα
regulation. Indeed, we and others have shown that S6K1 regulates ERα transactivational
activity in control of breast cancer cell proliferation by directly phosphorylating ERα on
Ser167 [7, 19, 20]. Therefore, maintaining high co-overexpression of both S6K1 and ERα
may provide a selective advantage for breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

While many studies have addressed the regulation of S6K1 kinase activity, very little is
known regarding the transcriptional regulation of S6K1 expression. Since ERα is a
transcription factor that regulates expression of many growth- and proliferation-promoting
genes, we asked whether ERα is involved in regulation of S6K1 expression. We found that
in ER-positive breast cancer cells, estrogen regulates S6K1 expression via ERα. Our data
support a model of a functional co-regulatory relationship between ERα and S6K1 that
controls breast cancer cell proliferation. Most significantly, the identification of RPS6KB1 as
an estrogen-inducible gene may help to elucidate the mechanisms of breast cancer
pathogenesis, and may lead to the development of new targeted therapies.

Results
Estrogen regulates S6K1 protein expression

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We used the ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which serves as a model for
studying the basic responses of breast cancer cells to estrogens. We observed that the
addition of estrogen to MCF7 cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase in S6K1 protein
levels. As shown in Figure 1A, elevated S6K1 expression correlated with increased activity
of S6K1 as detected by phosphorylation of S6K1 target proteins, rpS6 at Ser240/244 and
ERα at Ser167. In addition, we quantified the upregulation of S6K1 expression by estrogen
in MCF7 cells using in-cell Western analysis. As depicted in Figure 1B, S6K1 expression
increased with gradual dose increase of estrogen. Since the kinase activity of S6K1 is
important for driving cellular proliferation, we also directly measured the activity of
endogenous S6K1 in estrogen-treated MCF7 cells using an in vitro kinase assay (Figure 1C).
We observed that the increase in S6K1 protein levels results in a corresponding increase in
the enzymatic activity of S6K1. In parallel, we determined whether estrogen-induced S6K1
kinase activity correlates with ERα transcriptional activity. As shown in Figure 1D, we
transfected MCF7 cells with a reporter construct that contains firefly luciferase gene under
the control of three estrogen response elements (EREs) and a control construct expressing
renilla luciferase under the control of SV40 promoter for luciferase activity normalization,
and then starved and stimulated the cells as in Figure 1B. We found that estrogen-regulated
transcriptional activity mirrored the S6K1 kinase activity we observed earlier. We next
investigated whether estrogen-mediated regulation of S6K1 levels depends on the cell line’s
ER status. As illustrated in Figure 1E, estrogen addition resulted in increased S6K1 levels in
other ER-positive cell lines, BT-474 and ZR-75-1, but not in the ER-negative cell lines
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. We also confirmed our observations in primary cells by
analyzing S6K1 expression in mammary glands from ovariectomized mice treated with 17βestradiol for 12 and 18 hours. As depicted in Figure 1F, expression of total S6K1 protein, as
well as its activated form (phosphorylated on Thr389), and phosphorylated rpS6 increased in
murine mammary cells following estradiol administration in vivo. We also observed that
estrogen regulates S6K1 mRNA expression, as determined by real-time RT-qPCR analysis
(Figure 1G). Using Actinomycin D treatment, we determined that estrogen regulates
transcription, rather than stability of the S6K1 transcript. Actinomycin D prevented
estrogen-induced upregulation of the S6K1 mRNA in serum-starved cells, but we observed
no significant decrease in mRNA levels in untreated growing cells. Collectively, these data
indicate that estrogen regulates S6K1 expression.
Estrogen regulates RPS6KB1 promoter activity

Author Manuscript

To determine whether RPS6KB1 regulation by estrogen may occur through its interaction
with ERα, we extracted the proximal promoter region of RPS6KB1 from the UCSC Genome
Bioinformatics database and performed a search for EREs and other transcription factor
biding sites using publically available transcription factor binding sites predictor programs,
such as TESS (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess/tess) and TRANSFAC (generegulation.com). While the region spanning 2 kb upstream and downstream of the
transcription start site did not contain consensus EREs, we identified an imperfect

palindrome, a half-ERE, as well as three GATA-3 sites, two SP-1 sites, an AP-1 site, and a
TATA-box (Figure S1).

To test the hypothesis that estrogen may regulate RPS6KB1 expression via the proximal
promoter region, we obtained the 1kb promoter region upstream of the RPS6KB1
transcription start site controlling firefly luciferase expression and measured the activity of
the RPS6KB1 promoter in ER+ and ER− cells. As depicted in Figure 2A, estrogen addition
to ER+ MCF7 cells resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity
controlled by the RPS6KB1 promoter. A similar increase in the RPS6KB1 promoter activity
was measured in another ER-positive cell line, BT-474 (Figure 2B). We then tested whether
ERα directly binds the 1kb proximal promoter region of RPS6KB1 using chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) promoter tiling assay with primers spaced around every 100bp.
However, ChIP assay did not reveal significant enrichment in ERα at the RPS6KB1 1kb
promoter region in estrogen-stimulated MCF7 cells compared to binding to the control PS2
promoter (data not shown). However, others have detected ERα binding near the RPS6KB1
gene [21], leading us to theorize that ERα may synergize with other transcription factors to
regulate this promoter region. Since the 1kb promoter region contains several consensus
GATA-3 binding sites, we investigated whether estrogen regulates the promoter via
GATA-3. Indeed, following estrogen treatment we observed significant enrichment in
GATA-3 throughout the RPS6KB1 promoter, but not at the transcription start site (TSS)
(Figure 2C). Moreover, we tested for enrichment in RNA polymerase II C-terminal tail
phosphorylated at serine 5 (RNPII S5P) and histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4
(H3K4Me3), which are markers of transcriptional activation. We detected estrogenstimulated binding of RNPII S5P to the promoter of RPS6KB1, peaking strongly at TSS, and
decreasing gradually away from the TSS in the 1kb region tested. Similarly, we detected
estrogen-stimulated H3K4Me3 presence at TSS and up to several hundred bp away. In
contrast, we did not detect RNPII S5P and H3K4Me3 presence within an exonic region,
underscoring their role as markers of active promoter regions. As a control, total histone H3
binding was present in all sequences tested, and the levels were unchanged by estrogen
treatment. Thus, estrogen may regulate the transcriptional activity of the RPS6KB1 promoter
in a mechanism involving recruitment of GATA-3.
Modulation of ERα overexpression affects S6K1 levels

Author Manuscript

To further determine whether estrogen regulates S6K1 expression via ERα, we
overexpressed ERα in MCF7 cells. We observed constitutively upregulated S6K1 protein
expression, which was no longer inducible by estrogen (Figure 3A). We next expressed
different amounts of ERα in MCF7 cells and ER-negative HEK293E cells in the absence of
estrogen (Figure 3B). We observed a dose-dependent increase in S6K1 expression, which
correlated with increased activity of S6K1, as manifested by increased phospho-S6 levels.
Expression of ERα with a mutation in serine 167, a residue phosphorylated by S6K1, an
allele with defective transcriptional activity, was not able to induce S6K1 expression in ERnegative MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3C). We next interrogated the effect of estrogen on the
RPS6KB1 promoter in ERα-overexpressing cells using luciferase reporter assay. As depicted
in Figure 3D, ERα overexpression in ER-negative HEK293E cells resulted in high basal
promoter activity, which was further augmented by estrogen addition. In ER-negative MDA-

MB-231 cells, ERα overexpression increased basal RPS6KB1 promoter activity, which was
further augmented in the presence of estrogen (Figure 3E). Next, we lowered ERα
expression by means of two different siRNA duplexes or a combination of the two siRNAs
in MCF7 cells (Figure 4A). Reduced ERα expression resulted in decreased S6K1 protein
levels. Moreover, both basal and estrogen-induced activity of the RPS6KB1 promoter was
severely reduced following ERα knockdown (Figure 4B).
ERα and S6K1 collaborate in control of cell proliferation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that S6K1 provides a proliferation advantage to cells growing in
low-serum medium. These cells become dependent on the continuous activity of S6K1 in
such conditions [7]. Therefore, we sought to determine whether cells are also dependent on
ERα under restricted-serum conditions. As depicted in Figure 5A, we examined the effects
of full and low serum, rapamycin treatment, and the role of ERα and S6K1 levels in MCF7
cells. First we focused on the effect of rapamycin on cell growth in full and low serum. As
expected, MCF7 cells were sensitive to rapamycin treatment, however, the effect was
slightly more pronounced in low serum, underscoring the dependence of these cells on S6K1
activity for continuous proliferation. Next, we examined the effect of ERα knockdown on
MCF7 cell proliferation in full and low serum. As expected, reduction of ERα expression
led a significant decrease of about 25% in cell proliferation in full serum, and this effect was
even more pronounced in low serum conditions (about 50% reduction) compared to the
control siRNA. Significantly, ERα knockdown in low serum together with rapamycin
reduced cell proliferation more effectively than ERα knockdown in full serum in the
presence of rapamycin, compared to the siRNA control. Finally, we investigated whether the
effect of ERα knockdown on proliferation could be rescued by overexpression of S6K1. We
found that S6K1 overexpression could partially rescue proliferation reduction brought by
ERα knockdown. However, as expected, in the presence of rapamycin S6K1 was not longer
able to rescue the knockdown.
Conversely, we examined the effect of ERα overexpression on S6K1 expression and
proliferation in full and low serum. ERα induced basal S6K1 expression in MDA-MD-231
cells in serum-free conditions, and this effect was increased in low and full sera (Figure 5B).
While in full serum ERα overexpression had no discernable effect on cell proliferation, a
small, but significant effect on proliferation was observed in low serum, compared to vectorexpressing control (Figure 5C). Importantly, ERα Ser167Ala mutant was not able to
increase proliferation in low serum. We also made an interesting observation that ERα
overexpression rendered the cells more sensitive to rapamycin treatment in both full and low
serum conditions, similar to the phenotype observed with S6K1 overexpression [7].

Discussion
A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which estrogen stimulates cell
growth can provide new insight into the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ER-positive
breast cancer. For this reason, the identification of estrogen-responsive genes with
oncogenic properties could provide new avenues for experimental investigation. In this
report, we demonstrated that estrogen activates expression of S6K1 via ERα. The

identification of S6K1 as an estrogen-inducible gene is of great interest since it sheds light
on the mode of transcriptional regulation of S6K1 expression and may help understand the
role of S6K1 overexpression in the development and progression of breast cancer.

Author Manuscript

We found that estrogenic activation of S6K1 expression is mediated through ERα, as
summarized in Figure 6. In general, ER binds DNA either directly via EREs or tethered
though other transcription factors. Maximum ER transcriptional activity is thought to be
displayed by the interaction of ER with the ERE consensus sequence
(CAGGTCAnnnTGACCTG). While the ERE consensus sequence is rarely found in the
promoter regions of human genes [22], the promoter regions of estrogen-responsive genes
usually contain more than one imperfect palindromic sequence and widespread ERE halfsites, which have been shown to act synergistically [23]. While the promoter region of
RPS6KB1 contains what appear to be an imperfect palindrome and a half-site, we were not
able to detect ERα binding. It is known that ERα may exert effects at non-ERE-containing
chromatin targets through protein–protein interactions with DNA-bound transcription
factors [21]. The presence of several canonical GATA boxes in the promoter region of
RPS6KB1 led us to hypothesize that GATA-3 may be involved in mediating estrogenic
effects at this promoter. Using ChIP analysis we observed a significant enrichment in
estrogen-induced GATA-3 presence at the RPS6KB1 promoter, indicating a possible
mechanism through which ERα may mediate its transcriptional effect. This is a revealing
finding because estrogen stimulation of ERα-positive breast cancer cell proliferation has
been previously reported to occur via the transcription factor GATA-3 [24, 25]. Moreover,
analogous to S6K1, GATA-3 has also been shown to correlate in expression and activity
with ER [24, 26, 27].

Author Manuscript

In addition to direct binding by GATA-3, published data suggest that estrogenic regulation
of S6K1 expression may also occur via long-distance and secondary ERα effects that may
regulate the RPS6KB1 proximal promoter. About 95% of ERα binding sites are not located
within the promoter proximal region, but rather are found in the intronic or distal locations
of the transcription start site of a gene [28, 29]. RPS6KB1 was found to be associated with
half or full EREs in the 20kb region 5′ to the transcription start site [30], and ERα was found
to interact directly within an exonic region of RPS6KB1 [31]. The molecular mechanism by
which ERα synergizes with various transcription factors to contribute to estrogen-dependent
RPS6KB1 expression remains to be addressed.

Author Manuscript

We made the intriguing observation that S6K1 expression is maintained in two modes: a
basal level of expression, typical of normal cells, and an estrogen-ERα specific
upregulation. Correspondingly, we did not observe an increase in S6K1 expression in ERnegative cell lines. The significance of the co-stimulatory relationship between ER and
S6K1 can be seen when examining the rate of cell proliferation. Estrogen-induced
proliferation is largely dependent on mTOR signaling, and we observed that treatment of
MCF7 cells with rapamycin reduced cell proliferation. The novel finding presented here was
the effect of S6K1 and ER inhibition in low serum conditions. The ability to proliferate in
such conditions is one of the hallmarks of neoplastic transformation. We have previously
shown that S6K1 provides a proliferative advantage to cells in low serum conditions [7].
Here we found that rapamycin was more effective in reducing cell proliferation of cells

grown in low serum than in full serum. This finding is in agreement with the role of S6K1 in
driving proliferation in low serum conditions, whereby the cells are more dependent on the
activity of this kinase, and thus are more acutely sensitive to its inhibition. Similarly, ERα
knockdown was more effective in reducing cell proliferation in low serum than in full serum
conditions, underscoring the importance of the S6K1-ERα relationship in these cells. In
addition, S6K1 was able to partially rescue ERα knockdown. We observed that wildtype
ERα, but not ERα lacking the S6K1-dependent phosphorylation site (Ser167Ala mutant),
was able to induce S6K1 expression and promote proliferation in low serum. This
observation is supported by work from others which found that wildtype ERα, but not the
Ser167Ala mutant, was able to promote focus formation of cells grown in 1% serum [20].
We observed that increased estrogenic expression of S6K1 leads to increased kinase activity
and phosphorylation of its downstream effectors, including ERα. Together, these data
support our model of a positive co-regulatory loop between S6K1 and ERα. Importantly,
S6K1 can promote ERα activation in the absence of estrogen, therefore, high expression of
S6K1 might be one reason for acquiring ligand-independent proliferative ability [7, 19].
Moreover, estrogen and ERα-mediated stimulation of cell proliferation leads to
accumulation of genetic damage, resulting in neoplastic transformation [32]. Thus, 17q23
chromosomal region gain will augment expression of RPS6KB1 and activation of ERα, and
will contribute to dysregulated proliferation of cells during the progression to carcinogenesis
and breast cancer.

The future investigation of the relationship between S6K1 and ERα would lead to utilization
of S6K1 as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target, and would allow us to develop
novel cancer treatments to inhibit downstream pathways of estrogen action. While
combination of endocrine therapy and mTOR/S6K1 pathway inhibitors has been previously
used [33], the molecular mechanism explaining the patient response has not been determined
[34]. Based on the data presented above, we propose that the positive co-regulatory loop
between S6K1 and ERα promotes cell proliferation in ER-positive breast cancer, and
provides a rational approach for treatment of ER-positive and S6K1-overexpressing tumors.

expressed in n-fold differences in mRNA expression relative to the expression of GAPDH
and the reference sample.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR

Author Manuscript

MCF-7 cells were grown for at least 3 days phenol-red free media with charcoal-stripped
(low-estrogen) FBS. Cells at ~90% confluency were starved in serum- and phenol-red free
media for 24 h and 10nM estrogen was added for 24 h, were indicated. The cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 12 min immediately
prior to harvesting. ChIP assays were performed as described previously [35] using
polyclonal antibodies against ERα and GATA-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), histone H3,
trimethylated histone H3, and RNA poll II phosphorylated Ser5 (Abcam), as well as “no
antibody” controls. The resulting ChIP DNA material was used in qPCR analyses (the
primer sequences are listed in the supplemental data). The no antibody signals from the
ChIP assays fro each of the primers sets were subtracted from individual antibody signals.
Each experiment was run at least twice to ensure reproducibility.
Cell Proliferation Measurements

Author Manuscript

Cell proliferation was assayed using the WST-1 reagent (Millipore). Briefly, cells were
seeded in quadruplicate at a density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and grown
overnight. Media were changed to assay media with or without the agents, as indicated in
the figure legends. Cell proliferation was assayed after 96 h and absorbance was recorded
with a microtiter plate spectrophotometer. Cell density was averaged and plotted using
Excel.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons between experimental conditions and controls were made using Excel by twotailed paired Student’s t test. The data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical difference
was denoted as follows: *, p <0.05; **, p <0.001.

levels of S6K1 (yellow) in the merged signal image from three independent experiments are
quantified in the graph, where the untreated condition is set as the 100% control. Statistical
differences are shown between control and estrogen-deprived cells, as well as between
estrogen-treated and estrogen-deprived cells. (C) S6K1 was immunoprecipitated from
MCF7 cells treated as in (B). An in vitro kinase assay towards recombinant GST-rpS6 was
performed as described in Materials and Methods, and a representative gel is shown. Levels
of [γ-32P]ATP incorporation from three independent experiments were determined by
autorad, quantified suing the QuantityOne software and plotted using Excel. (D) MCF7 cells
were transfected with plasmids encoding ERE-firefly luciferase construct, and control
Renilla luciferase. 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved, and treated with the

Figure 6. S6K1 and ERα participate in a positive co-regulatory relationship

Author Manuscript

ERα is activated by binding to its ligand estrogen, leading to dissociation of Heat shock
proteins (HSPs), receptor dimerization, activation, and translocation to the nucleus.
Phosphorylation by S6K1 promotes ligand-independent activation of ERα. In the nucleus,
ERα activates the promoter region of RPS6KB1 and upregulates transcription of the S6K1
mRNA. S6K1 protein produced as a result of ERα transactivation leads to increased
activation of ERα, establishing a positive feed-forward loop.
