METHODS. Thalidomide has been used as a salvage regimen at the study institution since 1999. A total of 102 myeloma patients who were diagnosed between
January 1999 and February 2005 were evaluable for intention-to-treat analysis; 78
patients received thalidomide (at a dose of 100 mg/day continuously) and dexamethasone (at a dose of 40 mg/day on Days 1–4 each month) (TD) as salvage
treatment whereas 24 patients died or were lost to follow-up before the initiation
of TD. Several parameters such as serum b2-microglobulin, serum C-reactive
protein, immunoglobulin A isotype, hemoglobin, stage of disease, bone marrow

tion with overall survival (OS).

RESULTS. The OS from the time of diagnosis was 43.8 months. Using univariate
analysis, factors found to be associated with a shorter OS were a creatinine level
2 mg/dL (P 5 .05), stage III (P 5 .04), and time to first disease progression 12
months (P < .0001). The only factor that remained significantly associated with a
shorter OS in multivariate models was time to first disease progression 12
months (P 5 .0006). Elevated serum b2-microglobulin was not found to be predictive of poor OS.

CONCLUSIONS. Time to first disease progression >12 months was found to be
the best indicator of OS. Elevated serum b2-microglobulin, generally considered
to be a poor prognostic factor, was not found to be predictive of outcome.

ecause of the high heterogeneity of the disease, survival for
patients with multiple myeloma (MM) varies from <6 months
to >10 years. Several clinical and laboratory parameters have been
described as independent predictors of survival. Hemoglobin and
serum calcium, albumin, and creatinine levels as well as serum b2microglobulin and C-reactive protein levels and the proliferative activity of bone marrow plasma cells have emerged as the most
powerful independent prognostic factors.1–6 Recently, the negative
prognostic role of specific chromosomal translocations such as
t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), or deletion 17q13 has been established.7–9
Chromosome 13 deletion is the most commonly reported prognostic
abnormality.8,9 The magnitude of M-protein reduction and time to

the first disease progression have been used as surrogate markers of survival and/or treatment benefit. In
a large survey of 1555 untreated patients, time to first
disease progression >12 months, rather than the
magnitude of response, emerged as the best indicator of survival.10
In the last decade, thalidomide, a potent immunomodulatory drug with antiangiogenesis properties,
has been introduced in the treatment of MM. Thalidomide was found to synergistically enhance the activity of dexamethasone in preclinical studies11 and
their combination induced partial responses in 41%
to up to 55% of patients, with a median progressionfree survival of 1 year in patients with advanced
MM.12,13 The combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone (TD) has been proven effective in a large
cohort of pretreated patients and their 3-year survival
was significantly increased compared with historic
controls treated with conventional chemotherapy
(P < .0016).14 The TD combination currently represents one of the most widely used salvage regimens
for MM.
Prognostic factors may help to select patients
who will benefit the most from different therapies. In
the current study, we evaluated baseline demographic
and clinical parameters to determine their value in
predicting the outcome of patients with recurrent or
refractory MM who were treated with TD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
At our institution, all myeloma patients have received
salvage therapy with TD as per the center guidelines
since 1999. A total of 102 patients were diagnosed
between January 1999 and February 2005 and were
evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis. Seventyeight of these patients received TD salvage therapy
between June 2000 and December 2005, whereas 24
patients either died or were lost to follow-up before
the initiation of TD therapy. Inclusion criteria were
previously treated MM, age >18 years with no upper
limits, and measurable disease. The staging system
of Durie and Salmon was used.15 Patients agreed to
use contraception, and women of childbearing age
were given a pregnancy test before study enrollment.
Exclusion criteria were a second malignancy, psychiatric disease, and any grade 2 peripheral neuropathy
according to Common Toxicity Criteria 2.0. Abnormal
cardiac function, chronic respiratory disease, and
abnormal liver or renal function were not considered
to be criteria for exclusion. The study was approved
by the local Institutional Review Board. Written

informed consent was obtained at the time of study
entry in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Treatment and Evaluation of Outcome
Thalidomide (Grunenthal GmbH, 52222 Stolberg)
was administered at a dose of 100 mg/day continuously and oral dexamethasone was administered at a
dose of 40 mg/day on Days 1–4 each month until
evidence of recurrence or refractory disease. Responses were categorized according to the criteria of
the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation with the addition of a very good partial
response (VGPR) category.16 Briefly, a complete
response (CR) required the disappearance of serum/
urine myeloma protein and negative immunofixation. A partial response (PR) required at least a 50%
reduction in serum myeloma protein and a 90%
decrease in urine myeloma protein. Near-complete
remission (nCR), a subcategory of PR, required the
disappearance of serum/urine myeloma proteins
with positive immunofixation. VGPR, a subcategory
of PR, required a reduction of 90% in serum myeloma proteins. Minimal response (MR) was defined
as a reduction in serum myeloma protein of 25% to
49% and a reduction in urine myeloma protein of
50% to 89%. Disease progression was defined as an
increases in serum or urine myeloma protein
of >25%. Responses were confirmed after 6 weeks.
Bone marrow plasmacytosis and skeletal disease
were included in the response evaluation. Event-free
survival (EFS) was calculated from the initiation of
thalidomide treatment until the date of disease progression, relapse death from any cause, or the date
the patient was last known to be in disease remission. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
time of diagnosis until the date of death from any
cause or the date the patient was last known to be
alive.
Eleven potentially relevant predictors of outcome
were evaluated. Chromosome 13 deletion and albumin were not included because data regarding these
2 variables were not available for a large number of
patients. Age, time to first disease progression, and
laboratory variables were dichotomized with the usually reported cutoff points. For OS, the following factors were assessed: age (<65 years vs 65 years),
gender, stage of disease (Durie and Salmon stage I,
II, or III), previous stem cell transplantation, percentage of plasma cells in bone marrow biopsy (<40%
vs 40%), hemoglobin concentration (10 g/dL
vs >10 g/dL), creatinine (<2 mg/dL vs 2 mg/dL),
M-protein isotype (immunoglobulin [Ig] A, IgG, light
chain), serum b2-microglobulin (<3.5 mg/L vs 3.5
mg/L), C-reactive protein (<6 mg/L vs 6 mg/L),

and time to first disease progression (12 months
vs >12 months). Hemoglobin, creatinine, serum b2microglobulin, and C-reactive protein levels were
measured at the time of diagnosis.

Statistical Analyses
All 102 patients were entered into the intention-totreat analysis. Data were analyzed as of April 1, 2006.
Survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier
method17 and differences were tested by the log-rank
test. In the univariate analysis assessing OS, Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to detect
clinically relevant interactions between outcome and
each prognostic factor.18 The Cox proportional hazards
model was used to estimate the hazards ratios (HR)
and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). An HR >1
indicated an increased risk, whereas an HR <1 indicated a decreased risk.
In the multivariate analysis assessing OS, the Cox
proportional hazards model was used to analyze all
factors to identify independent variables that were
predictive of survival. A P value <.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical tests were
2-sided. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
software (version 8.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
The study group was comprised of 102 patients (60 of
whom were male) with median age of 63.7 years
(range, 31.3–83.7 years). Patient characteristics are
illustrated in Table 1. At the time of diagnosis, 53
patients were treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (41 patients received tandem melphalan at
a dose of 100 mg/m2 and 12 patients received tandem
melphalan at a dose of 200 mg/m2), and 49 patients
were treated with conventional chemotherapy (38
patients received oral melphalan and prednisone and
11 patients were treated with the combination of
dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and vincristine). The
median time to first disease progression was 20.1
months in patients treated with autologous stem cell
transplantation and 9.9 months in patients treated
with conventional chemotherapy. The median OS
from the time of diagnosis was 43.8 months.

Patients Receiving TD
Seventy-eight patients received TD (63 after first-line
therapy, 10 after 2-line therapy, and 5 after third-line
therapy, respectively). TD was administered a median
of 19.5 months from the time of diagnosis. The median follow-up from the initiation of TD therapy was
27.5 months (range, 3.9–65.7 months). CRs or PRs
were observed in 39 of the 78 patients (50%). A nCR

VGPR or CR were observed in 16 patients (20.5%).
Fifty-two of the 78 patients (67%) experienced disease progression, recurrence, or death and 38
patients died (49%). The median EFS from the time
of the initiation of TD therapy and the OS from the
time of diagnosis were 15.7 months and 57.4 months,
respectively. The achievement of at least a VGPR did
not appear to affect either the EFS (HR of 1.29; 95%
CI, 0.53–3.15 [P 5 .58]) or OS of patients treated with
TD (HR of 0.86; 95% CI, 0.31–2.35 [P 5 .77]).

Prognostic Factors Affecting Outcome

isotype did not appear to affect patient outcome,
whereas a serum creatinine 2 mg/dL (P 5 .05),
stage III disease (P 5 .04), and time to first disease
progression 12 months (P < .0001) were found to
be associated with shorter OS (Table 2). The median
OS of patients who developed disease progression 
and >12 months from the time of diagnosis were
19.6 months and 59.1 months, respectively. Disease
progression >12 months from the time of diagnosis
was associated with significantly longer survival
(P < .0001). Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown
in Figure 1. The median OS of patients with serum
b2-microglobulin <3.5 mg/L and those with serum
b2-microglobulin 3.5 mg/L were 43.8 months and

45.0 months, respectively. Low serum b2-microglobulin was not found to be associated with significantly
longer survival (P 5 .96), as shown in Figure 2.
The only factor that remained significantly associated with a shorter OS on multivariate models
was a time to first disease progression 12 months
(P 5 .0006) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Thalidomide in combination with corticosteroids
has been widely used as a salvage regimen for
patients with recurrent and refractory MM. In the
current study, the results of multivariate analysis
indicated that a time to first disease progression >12
months is the best predictor of prolonged survival,
whereas both elevated serum b2-microglobulin
and C-reactive protein levels do not appear to affect
outcome.
It has previously been shown that the best independent indicator of survival duration is time to first
disease progression.10 In some studies, the achievement of a CR has been reported to be an excellent
predictor of outcome,19–21 whereas in other reports,

828

CANCER

the magnitude of response as an independent variable did not predict survival.10,22–24 Major determinants of survival most likely are related to 1) the
number and intrinsic biology of the resistant myeloma cells remaining after induction therapy25,26
and 2) host factors responsible for myeloma cell
growth regulation.27,28 This may explain why the duration of disease remission rather than the magnitude of response, which does not necessarily
reflect these 2 biologic factors, is a better predictor
of survival. In the light of these results, clinicians
and investigators should be particularly aware of
response duration rather than single M-protein
decrements in assessing the usefulness and clinical
benefit of a given treatment in patients with MM.
The results of the current study demonstrate that
patients with a particularly good prognostic marker,
such as longer time to first disease progression, are
those who will benefit the most from TD salvage
therapy. This may lead physicians to consider more
aggressive approaches such as the combination of
melphalan and/or doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide with thalidomide in patients with a short duration of response. Previous experiences were derived
from patients treated with standard-dose or highdose chemotherapy only, whereas in the current
study, the impact of time to first disease progression
was evaluated in patients who received a new, biologically based treatment with thalidomide.
Serum b2-microglobulin level is one of the most
widely used prognostic factors in MM. The importance of prognostic factors in the pretreatment
evaluation of MM patients has gained even more significance with the creation of the new International
Staging System.6 This system uses only 2 simple factors for staging newly diagnosed patients: serum albumin as an indicator of rapid myeloma growth and b2microglobulin as a marker of tumor burden. In the
current study, both b2-microglobulin and C-reactive
protein were not found to be predictive of outcome.
New drugs such as thalidomide and bortezomib may
reduce the impact of these factors even though to our
knowledge the reasons for this have not yet been fully
elucidated. In 1 report, an increased baseline b2microglobulin level was associated with poor OS on
univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis in
patients with recurrent and refractory MM who were
treated with bortezomib.29 In another study in which
thalidomide was included in a double autologous
stem cell transplantation program for newly diagnosed MM patients, the probability of EFS was found
to be significantly lower in patients with high levels of
b2-microglobulin. However, this parameter failed to
predict OS on multivariate analysis.21

Patients with a poor prognosis remain an
unsolved therapeutic challenge. New drugs, highly
effective as salvage treatments, have been shown to
be more effective in good-risk patients.21,30,31
Patients with aggressive disease recurrence and
those at poor risk also may benefit less from the
TD combination.
It should be emphasized that the analyses and
models used in the current study should be considered exploratory and our conclusions are subject to
confirmation by further clinical studies. However,
although these precautions are mandatory, there is
growing evidence that major prognostic factors such
as serum b2-microglobulin and chromosome 13 deletion may have a smaller impact on OS after therapy
with thalidomide and/or bortezomib. Such evidence
calls for the better identification of newer prognostic
factors that may better define those patients who
would benefit the most from salvage regimens with
new drugs.
