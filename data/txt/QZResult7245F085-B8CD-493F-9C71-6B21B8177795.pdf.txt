Stephanie Lheureux, MD, PhD1; Katherine Karakasis, MSc1; Elise C. Kohn, MD2; and Amit M. Oza, MD (Lon), FRCP1

The diagnosis, investigation, and management of ovarian cancer are in a state of flux‚Äîbalancing ever rapid advances in our understanding of its biology with 3 decades of clinical trials. Clinical trials that started with empirically driven selections have evolved in an
evidence-informed manner to gradually improve outcome. Has this improved understanding of the biology and associated calls to
action led to appropriate changes in therapy? In this review, the authors discuss incorporating emerging data on biology, combinations, dose, and scheduling of new and existing agents with patient preferences in the management of women with ovarian cancer.

CHANGING CONCEPTS FOR SYSTEMIC THERAPY: THE CHALLENGE
The established standard strategy for treatment of advanced ovarian cancer (OC), up until recently, has been debulking
surgery and 6 to 8 cycles of platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy followed by surveillance for potential recurrence (Table
1).1-3 The success of this strategy depends on the skill of the surgeon and the extent of debulking, and perhaps on the intensity and delivery of chemotherapy.1 Unfortunately, all too often, initial therapy fails, and 3 of 4 women who initially
present with advanced disease relapse.4 Subsequent sequential treatment strategies maximize quality and length of life5
but are not curative. Second-line chemotherapy is still based on a crude but simple and effective algorithm, duration of the
platinum-free interval (PFI),6 whereby platinum sensitivity is defined as relapse occurring 6 months from the time of initial chemotherapy completion. Rechallenge with platinum doublet chemotherapy at this disease-sensitive time is the
standard of care worldwide, with 6 to 8 cycles of therapy prescribed followed in complete responders by a ‚Äúwatch-andwait‚Äù period.7-9 The PFI has been used as a predictive measure of the likely response to subsequent platinum and nonplatinum therapy. The defined number of cycles was established initially, like most other indications for chemotherapy, on the
concept of log-cell kill from the Skipper-Schobel-Wilcox and Goldie-Coldman models of cell growth kinetics10,11 and
was validated by a lack of improvement in overall survival (OS) from increasing the number of cycles.12 Chemotherapy
primarily damages rapidly proliferating cells13 and, thus, is effective only in that proportion of tumor cells within the cell
growth cycle. The best response to chemotherapy is often a reduction in tumor volume; however, not all clonal cells may
be eradicated, and mutations that allow cancer cells to survive, accumulated during therapy, may induce subsequent drug
resistance. Recurrence may also be the result of reactivating tumor-initiating cells or tumor cells with stem-like properties
that are not targeted by standard chemotherapy.
Recurrent disease follows a frequent relapse-response pattern for a modest time before becoming resistant to treatment. Clinically, this escalating resistance manifests as successively shorter disease-free intervals with each subsequent line
of therapy. At the time of platinum-resistance, different monochemotherapies are used until patients develop disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1,14 Continuing monochemotherapy in this population when there is clinical benefit
may be important for sustained response15 despite the high likelihood of unavoidable relapse or progression. In effect, the
current paradox is to stop treatment during initial response and to resume/continue the same treatment while disease

becomes increasingly more resistant. Unfortunately, the
patient will ultimately die of her disease with a median
OS of approximately 12 months after the development of
platinum resistance.
This existing treatment strategy in OC has been
largely driven by activity in high-grade serous (high-grade
serous OC [HGSOC]) and endometrioid (high-grade serous endometrial cancer [HGSEC]) histologies, but all
epithelial types have been treated uniformly for ‚Äúwant of
something better‚Äù (Fig. 1, Table 1). There are 5 disparate
histologic types of OC that have a diverse genomic landscape with different natural histories and patterns of
response to therapy.16,17
It is now time to demand evidence of benefit in
each of the OC subtypes and to challenge the dogma
of cytotoxic chemotherapy for all types of OC.16,18
Chemoresistance is consistently reported in type I OC,
admittedly mostly based on smaller, retrospective,
single-institution studies. Women with clear cell, mucinous, and low-grade serous tumors are routinely
offered standard chemotherapy,19 more for want of an
alternative strategy or for fear of under-treating than
3204

belief that the treatment is effective. Perhaps we should
abandon current adjuvant chemotherapy for specific
OC subtypes in which the evidence is inadequate.
What is the benefit of standard adjuvant chemotherapy
that we should expect in confirmed clear cell20-22 or
low-grade serous23,24 cancer after complete debulking
surgery, either at an early stage or even at an advanced
stage? In this setting, in which there is insufficient level
1 evidence of true benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy, perhaps well designed clinical trials should be the
new standard, potentially with a control no-treatment
arm. This would allow the detection of an improvement in efficacy, or not. The paradox and potentially
ethical dilemma remains that patients often have to satisfy prior ‚Äústandards‚Äù of chemotherapy to be eligible
for clinical trials, standards that apply because all
epithelial subtypes were grouped together; standards
that perhaps today would not meet the rigorous level 1
evidence base required by patients, clinicians, and
regulators.

HGSEC. Germline and somatic breast cancer gene
(BRCA) status appears to be prognostic and increasingly predictive and has an impact at least on shortterm to moderate-term clinical outcomes. Future
HGSOC trials should stratify for this biologically relevant characteristic as a baseline requirement. Similarly, the option of radiation therapy for selected
histologic types needs to be revisited.25,26 Radiotherapy typically is used for palliation in patients with
HGSOC but may be beneficial in those with clear
cell OC, as suggested by recent retrospective studies.21,27 Hormone therapy, which is rarely used in
HGSOC, may be a useful and safe strategy for some
specific histology subgroups. such as endometrioid or
low-grade serous.28,29 Previous clinical trials of hormones have produced modest response rates overall;
however, they have consistently identified a small
subset of patients who respond very well to endocrine
therapy,30 and we need to understand what is unique
about these responders. Targeted therapy may also be
appropriate in specific histologic subtypes, such as
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)
inhibitors in low grade serous OC. On the basis of
activity observed with selimetinib in a phase 2 trial
Cancer

dedicated to low-grade serous OC,31 phase 3 studies
are ongoing to assess MEK inhibitors in this histologic subgroup (the MEK Inhibitor in Low-Grade
Serous Ovarian Cancer [MILO] trial, national clinical trial [NCT] 01849874; and Gynecologic Oncology Group Trial 281 [GOG281], NCT02101788).
INCORPORATING MAINTENANCE AND
SEQUENTIAL THERAPY
Current adjuvant treatment in HGSOC is discontinued
after 6 to 8 cycles, although it is clear that cancer cells persist, judging by recurrence patterns. This is based on modeling effects of chemotherapy and tumor cell kill and on
toxicity, which is often cumulative and sometimes irreversible. Maintenance therapy was initially proposed to
delay subsequent progression through the continuation of
treatment with the expectation that delaying progression
could translate into an improved overall duration of survival.32 Maintenance treatment has been successfully validated in other malignancies with a high-risk of
recurrence, such as breast cancer (trastuzumab and hormone therapy). Maintaining a lower level of disease burden may be a way to improve disease control and, thus,
the time to progression. Residual disease after primary
3205

Review Article

debulking surgery in OC remains one of the most powerful prognostic and predictive factors for OS.33 Gompertzian modeling demonstrates increased percentages of
necrotic and hypoxic tissues within the tumor with tumor
growth, both of which are major factors in drug resistance.34 This aligns with the drive to understand the tumor
microenvironment and cancer cell biology to improve disease control. HGSOC is characterized by genomic instability,35 with genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity
in time and space that result in a broad variety of‚Äîand
potentially functional‚Äîlesion-specific deregulation of
cellular pathways.36 Attempting to lower tumor burden
with maintenance therapy may limit the number of clones
and acquisition of additional mutations that engender
therapeutic resistance. The tumor-initiating cell theory
further supports a maintenance strategy by attempting to
silence tumorigenic potential.37
This closely mirrors the use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiretroviral treatments in an attempt
to maintain low viral loads, thus avoiding viral resistance.38 The short life cycle of HIV and the high error rate
cause the virus to mutate very rapidly, resulting in high
genetic variability.39 Thus, the more active copies of the
virus, the greater the possibility that one resistant to antiretroviral drugs will arise,40 accentuating the importance
of maximal viral load suppression at treatment initiation.
After virus genotyping and HIV drug-resistance testing, a
3-drug combination is introduced without a ‚Äúdrug
holiday.‚Äù
However, in patients with HGSOC, continuing
platinum-based chemotherapy has produced no evidence
of long-term benefit, may contribute to chemoresistance,
and leads to cumulative toxicity.41 The effect of maintenance paclitaxel remains controversial,42-44 and several
modest sized trials have demonstrated some potential PFS
benefit without improving OS45,46 but with significant
cumulative toxicity. Results from the completed
GOG212 trial (NCT00108745), which compared paclitaxel with polyglutamate paclitaxel or observation after
standard treatment, may resolve this question. Maintenance treatment with erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapeutic,47 or anticancer antigen
125 (anti-CA 125) antibodies, such as abagovomab,48
failed to have an impact on the outcomes of women who
had no clinical evidence of disease after standard therapy.49,50 New expectations have surfaced for maintenance
therapy in HGSOC that incorporates complementary
mechanisms of action beside standalone chemotherapy,
including targeting deficiencies in the homologous
recombination repair (HRR) pathway and angiogenesis.
3206

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair defects consistent
with HRR dysfunction are referred to as the ‚ÄúBRCAness
phenotype,‚Äù a potential HGSOC Achilles heel.51 Two
randomized phase 2 trials testing the poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib as maintenance
therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy (prescribed
as long as patients were benefiting from therapy) have
demonstrated a marked improvement in PFS for patients
with recurrent, platinum-sensitive HGSOC, particularly
for those with BRCA mutations.52,53
Targeting the tumor microenvironment through the
inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis has been also
an effective strategy supporting the maintenancetreatment hypothesis. Continuation of bevacizumab alone
in the adjuvant setting for 12 or 15 months after chemotherapy first-line chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab produced a modest but significant PFS benefit
in 2 phase 3 studies (GOG218 and ICON7 [a Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup trial]).54,55 It is noteworthy that,
based on a planned survival analysis of the ICON7 trial,
in the high-risk subgroup (patients with suboptimally
debulked stage III/IV disease and nonsurgical patients), a
significant 9.4-month improvement in median OS was
observed.56 Two phase 3 trials with bevacizumab prescribed until disease progression or intolerance‚Äîone in
the platinum-sensitive setting (the OCEANS [Ovarian
Cancer Comparing Efficacy and Safety of Chemotherapy
and Antiangiogenic Therapy in Platinum-Sensitive
Recurrent Disease] trial), in which bevacizumab was combined with carboplatin/gemcitabine followed by bevacizumab alone, and one in the platinum-resistant setting (the
AURELIA [A Study of Avastin Added to Chemotherapy
in Patients With Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer]
trial), in which bevacizumab was combined with monochemotherapy‚Äîdemonstrated a significant benefit for
maintenance on PFS, but no OS benefit was observed in
either study.57,58 The benefit of adding and continuing an
antiangiogenic agent was further confirmed with pazopanib, nintedanib, and cediranib.59-61 Data from the German Gynecologic Oncology Study Group-Ovarian
Cancer 16 (AGO-OVAR16) phase 3 trials in women with
advanced OC who had not progressed after front-line
chemotherapy indicated a statistically significant PFS
benefit for patients who received pazopanib versus placebo for up to 24 months59 (P 5 .0021). AGO-OVAR12
is another phase 3 study of antiangiogenic therapy evaluating nintedanib as front-line therapy for women with
advanced OC.60 The nintedanib arm exhibited a mild
improvement in PFS. This PFS benefit was higher among
patients from the low-risk group of women who had small

residual tumors after surgery. Cediranib given concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy in ICON6 and
continued as maintenance for women in first platinumsensitive recurrence significantly improved PFS by 3.2
months and improved OS by 2.7 months.61 However, the
sample size in that trial had to be reconfigured midway
through the study, because the development of cedarinib
had been discontinued. Despite this growing body of evidence, there remains a discrepancy in antiangiogenic use
across the world. Defining the optimal therapy, schedule,
and sequence of antiangiogenics is a priority for OC therapy standardization.

WHEN SHOULD EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
BE INTRODUCED, INTERRUPTED, OR
CHANGED?
Sequential therapeutic interventions may maintain and
consolidate the initial treatment response. This can be
Cancer

accomplished using a multifaceted clinical strategy based
on tumor biology (Fig. 2).
Therapeutic strategies

Adding a third chemotherapy drug to standard chemotherapy or high-dose, sequential chemotherapy
increases toxicity but not disease control.62-64 Therefore, adding cytotoxic chemotherapy is not the answer.
Combination treatment strategies should be based on
biologic rationale and validated in rigorous clinical trials: for example, a test of combination therapy that
directly or indirectly silences driver targets, such as
HRR or tumor protein 53 (TP53).65 Targeting BRCA
dysfunction is a validated approach for HGSOC, as is
targeting TP53. Further investigations are also needed
to dissect the clinical impact of diverse mutations in
these driver genes, because there is probably variation
in the functional consequences from different mutations in candidate genes.
3207

Review Article

Microenvironment plasticity is central to success
and persistence of benefit from therapeutic intervention,
as shown by the data available on bevacizumab. Antiangiogenics have demonstrated benefit at the time of persistent/recurrent disease, perhaps of greater benefit than
when used in combination with chemotherapy. The
microenvironment also includes stromal and immune
events. There is growing evidence that OC is immunogenic and immunotrophic. These findings argue for close
examination of the new immunotherapy options, with
important consideration focused on clearly defining biomarkers that are reliably and reproducibly predictive of
response to treatment.66 Immune targeting strategies in
combination with therapy or sequentially as consolidation
would be rational and are being evaluated.
Treatment timing

The combination/sequential approach used in HIV may
not be clinically meaningful in OC and could lead to
increased toxicity. Time and sequence specificity of treatment, based on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of each drug, should be considered (Table 1).
Preclinical data and drug pharmacology may allow sequential dosing to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity.
For example, a phase 2 randomized clinical trials incorporating olaparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel (in combination and sequentially) have demonstrated increased
toxicity during combination therapy, which required
reductions in the dose intensity of carboplatin and olaparib, without improved effectiveness during the combination phase.53 In contrast, sequential therapy was
simpler, well tolerated, and improved PFS.52 However,
combined platinum-taxane chemotherapy is probably
better than sequential therapy and may be associated with
a PFS advantage67. This emphasizes the importance
exploring synergy caused by mechanisms of drug action or
pharmacokinetics in determining treatment timing.
Treatment timing in oncology remains an important
issue. Upfront maintenance therapy would appear to be
the most favorable period during which to invest and may
have the greatest potential, because the fewest resistant or
dormant tumor cells are present. Tools are needed to
identify persistent subclonal populations after the completion of initial therapy to better identify those women who
are more likely relapse and to differentiate them from the
women who may remain ‚Äúfree from relapse‚Äù without need
for further treatment. Monitoring techniques for circulating cancer cells68 or circulating tumor DNA69 may
impact our definitions of response and guide subsequent
therapies used in the maintenance setting. Circulating
3208

tumor DNA is being assessed in different disease types,70
not just as a marker of recurrence but also as a marker of
resistant subclones.71,72
Imaging and CA 125 monitoring are the diagnostic
modalities that currently determine the timing of new
therapeutic interventions. The question of when to stop
treatment in the maintenance setting‚Äîwhen a tumor progresses according Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors, at the time of clinical progression, or after an arbitrary period‚Äîremains to be defined. Several issues
endure with the use of CA 125 monitoring. It may not
track response or progression, optimally depending on the
treatment used73; lead-time bias is a confounding variable; and, finally, the attrition or attenuation of CA 125
rise over time limits its accuracy as a quantitative predictor
and, consequently, the ability to make therapeutic choices
based on the maker alone.74 Dynamic functional imaging
should be explored in OC subtypes to guide treatment,
provided there is sufficient sensitivity and specificity.
Dynamic imaging can be expensive; therefore, validation
with tissue biomarkers of early recurrence should be prioritized. The evaluation of techniques like positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging is critical,
along with objective assessment of their potential for predicting early treatment failure75 to allow the discontinuation of ineffective, potentially toxic, and almost certainly
expensive therapies.
Treatment selection

Comprehensive clinical assessment that incorporates performance status, previous treatments, and type of treatments is essential for making treatment decisions. The
PFI remains an accepted predictive algorithm for the
choice of next treatment in practice and for clinical trials
(Table 1).76 However, the emergence of a maintenance
approach scrambles this initial definition in terms of the
time to progression by prolonging the PFI through maintenance therapy. What is the difference between a relapse
within 5 months after standard adjuvant carboplatin plus
paclitaxel chemotherapy and a relapse within 7 months by
adding bevacizumab to the same chemotherapy? There is
no clear answer, but the patient will be treated differently
according to PFI criteria, because as she will be considered
platinum-resistant in the former case, but not in the latter.
Thus, biologic precision is needed to replace the currently
used algorithm of PFI, which has the advantage of simplicity and ease of use but remains arbitrary and subject to
variability based on intervals for follow-up or imaging
(Table 1). The potential for measuring drug-induced,
dynamic rewiring of signaling pathways provides the
Cancer

September 15, 2015

Ovarian Cancer Strategy/Lheureux et al

opportunity for novel sequential and time-dependent
approaches.77 Consequently, there is a growing practice
of performing repeat biopsies. Molecular profiling to help
match patients to specific targeted therapeutics is an
under-evaluated resource in OC.78 A retrospective, but as
yet unvalidated strategy has identified a predictive
response signature to the antiangiogenic bevacizumab,
which has resulted in the classification of a novel type of
immune signature.79 Molecular subclassifications of
HGSOC obtained from gene expression signatures16,80
suggest that patients with the mesenchymal subtype may
have a sustained benefit from bevacizumab.81 Those retrospective, yet to be validated analyses have generated
hypotheses that have to be evaluated prospectively to be
proven clinically useful. Currently, profiling objectives are
toward the identification and validation of biomarkers in
prospective clinical trials.82 With advancing technology,
costs should become less prohibitive and may be augmented by the development of customized, subtypespecific panels for defined populations. This will require
integration with access to targeted agents and clinical trials. This also will require clinical trials to develop and
incorporate outcomes and endpoints that are relevant and
meaningful for patients.83,84
INTEGRATION OF THERAPEUTIC
APPROACHES
The therapeutic approach in OC includes surgical intervention, which remains the mainstay of treatment alongside appropriate systemic therapy. Ongoing efforts
around the world are investigating the relevance of timing
of surgical intervention at initial diagnosis and the value
of surgery at recurrence. Furthermore, to optimize treatment timing and strategy, bioinformatics and mathematical modeling approaches are exploring research data on
the relation and communication between cellular and
extracellular signaling pathways.77 These models can be
context-dependent and must integrate tumor type specificity to determine pathway relevance.85,86
CONCLUSION
The treatment of ovarian cancer is on the verge of a major
change that will propel improvement in outcomes.87
Recent developments emphasize that a multipronged
approach is warranted, integrating genomics, subtypespecific maintenance therapy, and other directions that
will be used alongside increasingly sensitive diseasedetection tools. Better definition of treatment timing may
further allow exploitation of additional benefits of surgery
as the role of surgery remains central to OC treatment.
Cancer

September 15, 2015

Taken together, this will allow us to build on our understanding of the heterogeneity of OC to tailor treatment.
Future therapeutic strategy should target genetics, microenvironment, and sequence schedule to keep cancer cells
from developing resistance. To move forward, we have to
take some bold steps based on biology, require objective
evidence of benefit, and reflect on experience from other
cancers and diseases. It is important to constantly reevaluate data and expect that, for therapy to be considered
‚Äústandard,‚Äù it has to demonstrate objective, clinically
meaningful, as well as statistically significant benefit. The
timing is right for a paradigm shift that will require clinicians to have the courage and confidence to not prescribe
treatments without evidence of benefit. This will necessitate optimizing surgery and appropriate evidence-based
recommendations for each subtype of ovarian cancer.
This therapeutic direction has to be supported by excellence and precision in pathology, molecular profiling, and
imaging. In equal measure, it will require open dialogue
with patients and being honest about treatments that have
evidence of benefit and, especially, those that do not.
