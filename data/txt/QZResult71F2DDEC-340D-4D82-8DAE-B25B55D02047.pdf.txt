ABSTRACT
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is intensively used for the treatment of primary
breast cancer. In our previous studies, we reported that clinical tumor response to
NAC is associated with the change of multidrug resistance (MDR) gene expression
in tumors after chemotherapy. In this study we performed a combined analysis of
MDR gene locus deletions in tumor DNA, MDR gene expression and clinical response
to NAC in 73 BC patients. Copy number variations (CNVs) in biopsy specimens were
tested using high-density microarray platform CytoScanTM HD Array (Affymetrix,
USA). 75%–100% persons having deletions of MDR gene loci demonstrated the downregulation of MDR gene expression. Expression of MDR genes was 2–8 times lower
in patients with deletion than in patients having no deletion only in post-NAC tumors
samples but not in tumor tissue before chemotherapy. All patients with deletions of
АВСВ1 АВСВ3 ABCC5 gene loci – 7q21.1, 6p21.32, 3q27 correspondingly, and most
patients having deletions in АВСС1 (16p13.1), АВСС2 (10q24), ABCG1 (21q22.3),
ABCG2 (4q22.1), responded favorably to NAC. The analysis of all CNVs, including
both amplification and deletion showed that the frequency of 13q14.2 deletion was
85% among patients bearing tumor with the deletion at least in one MDR gene locus
versus 9% in patients with no deletions. Differences in the frequency of 13q14.2
deletions between the two groups were statistically significant (p = 2.03 х 10−11,
Fisher test, Bonferroni-adjusted p = 1.73 х 10−8). In conclusion, our study for the first
time demonstrates that deletion MDR gene loci can be used as predictive marker for
tumor response to NAC.

roles by removing potentially harmful molecules and can
cause the efflux of common chemotherapeutic agents, which
provide the mechanisms for multidrug resistance (MDR) to
hormonal, targeted and cytostatic therapy in many cancer
types, including breast cancer (BC) [1–4].

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly
used for the treatment of primary breast cancer to
downstage tumors, allows breast-conserving surgery [5]
and improves breast cancer survival. In our previous
studies, we reported that the clinical tumor response to
NAC appeared to be associated with changes in the
expression of the MDR gene in tumors after chemotherapy.
We have shown that the favorable tumor response to NAC
correlates with MDR gene down-regulation within breast
tumors after NAC [6]. In addition, we have recently found
that MDR gene down-regulation after NAC is associated
with higher 5-year metastatic-free survival rates in breast
cancer patients. In contrast, poor clinical response to
NAC appeared to be related to the increase in MDR gene
expression in tumor tissue after NAC and poor disease
prognosis [7].
Because the physiological function of ABC
transporters is the efflux of xenobiotics, including
chemotherapeutic drugs [1], the increased expression of
MDR genes is the expected cell response to chemotherapy.
This phenomenon is commonly known and has been
shown to be associated with drug-resistance in many
in vitro studies. Accumulating evidence indicates that
MDR gene up-regulation is induced by several genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA hypomethylation,
histone deacetylation, activation of available transcription
factors and miRNA expression, as well as the functioning
of MDR-related signaling pathways [8–15]. However,
relatively little is known about MDR down-regulation
in clinical breast cancers and only a few in vitro studies
are available. New ABC down-regulation mechanism has
been shown in SGC7901/VCR gastric cancer multi-drug
resistant cell line. Such ABC transporters as ABCB1,
ABCC5 and ABCG1 were found to be direct targets of
miR-129–5p. Wu Q et al demonstrated that miR-129–5p
over-expression resulted in the reduced chemo-resistance
of SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR cells [16].
Salvamoser J.D., et al. revealed a novel mechanism of
BCRP down-regulation in human brain capillaries. The
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was shown to
be involved in the down-regulation of BCRP, that was
confirmed by examining BCRP transport function and
expression after exposure to NMDA [17].
In clinical settings in addition to our research
data, Kim B. et al. have reported the reduction in protein
expression of P-glycoprotein and Bcrp in breast tumors
after NAC compared with that obtained in biopsies
taken before treatment in 26% and 41% of patients,
respectively. However, the mechanisms that contributed
to MDR gene down-regulation after chemotherapy was
not discussed [18]. Demidenko R., et al. found that eight
ABC transporter genes (ABCA8, ABCB1, ABCC6, ABCC9,
ABCC10, ABCD2, ABCG2, and ABCG4) displayed
markedly down-regulated expression in prostate cancer in
comparison with nonmalignant prostate tissues, that was
associated with gene promoter methylation [19].

Therefore, decreased MDR gene expression in breast
tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with
its effectiveness, but the molecular mechanism for MDR
down-regulation is poorly understood. We did not find
any correlation between clinicopathological features and
negative regulation of MDR gene expression in breast
tumors during therapy [6].
Further study is needed to clarify the mechanisms
responsible for MDR gene down regulation in breast
cancer patients treated with NAC, which could identify
novel predictive markers for the response to NAC and
novel targets for regulating the MDR phenotype.
We hypothesized that the negative regulation
of MDR gene expression in tumors of patients who
received chemotherapy was associated with deletions
of MDR gene loci. It is well known that DNA copy
number variations (CNVs), such as deletions and
amplifications, are major genomic alterations in breast
and other tumor sites (www.progenetix.org [20])
that contribute to tumor progression and response
to chemotherapy. Furthermore, deletions of DNA
loci are known to result in the reduced expression of
genes located in these regions [21, 22]. In contrast,
amplification of gene loci containing ABC transporters
was shown to be associated with poor prognosis.
Germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype of diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was characterized
by more gains at 7q22.1, which contained ABC
transporter ABCB1 compared to activated B-cell-like
(ABC) lymphoma, according to microarray analysis
[23]. Dunleavy K et al demonstrated a significantly
higher response (83% vs 13%; p < 0.001) and median
overall survival (10.8 vs 3.4 months; p = 0.003) in ABC
compared with GCB DLBCL, treated with doxorubicin
and bortesamib [24].
Kim I.-W., et al reported that one hundred
and fifty-two pharmacogenes were tested for CNV
frequencies in several tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma,
lung squamous cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia,
and lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma)
using The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset [25]. Authors
suppose that germ line and somatic CNVs of genes
involved in drug metabolism and efflux may contribute
to patient’s variations in drug responses and serve as
promising biomarkers to increase the benefits in cancer
treatment [25].
In our study, we performed a combined analysis
of deletions of MDR gene loci in tumor DNA, MDR
gene expression and clinical response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in BC patient cohorts. We designed
an integrated, analytical method to identify the
chromosome regions in which CNVs were correlated
with MDR gene down-regulation and the response to
NAC by taking genomic data on RNA gene expression
and variations in DNA copy number from the same
group of patients.

RESULTS

CNV, includes areas 1q, 8p, 8q, 11q, 16q, 17p and our
results are consistent with published data [26]. Additionally,
CNV have been found in 13q and 14q32 regions.
A large number of numerical CNV, which is mainly
represented by a single chromosome monosomy is also
observed in breast tumor. Aneuploidy occurs in more than
half of the samples, trisomies are observed much rarer.
Monosomy of chromosome 13 was the most common
(19 out of 68 patients  –  28%) followed by monosomy
of chromosome 14 (12/68  –  18%), chromosome 15
(9/68 – 13%), chromosomes 4 and 18 (7/68 each – 10%),
chromosome 17 (6/68 -9%), 9 and X chromosome (5 cases
each – 7%).
Monosomies were not seen in only 3 chromosomes:
1, 8 and 20, thus indicating their important role
in maintaining the viability of tumor cells. This is
confirmed by the presence of frequent structural CNV as
amplifications mentioned above. The frequency of trisomy
in some chromosomes was not exceed 4% (3 of 68 cases)
and trisomies of chromosomes 7, 8, 12, 17, 20 and 21 were
noted in 2–3 cases.

Structural CNVs have been observed in various
chromosomal regions in breast tumor. Figure 1
demonstrates the frequency of copy number variations
including deletions and amplifications in cytobands of all
BC patients. It is important that only in two chromosomes,
namely chromosome 1 and 8, tumor DNA amplifications
have been found in more than 30% of patients. The
frequency of DNA amplification in chromosome 1 long
arm (1q21.1 – 1q44 regions) was detected in the range
from 41% to 59% of the total tumor sample number.
Amplifications are observed in short (8p11.22
in 32.4% of cases) and long arms of chromosome
8 (8q12.1  –  8q24.3; from 32% to 57% of cases). In
8q11.21 – 23, 10p15.3 – 14, 14q32.33, 16p13.13, 17q24.2,
20q13.2 и 20q13.21 chromosomal regions amplifications
were detected in 25–30% of patients. Less frequently
observed amplifications with the frequency range from
25% to 30% of cases occur in regions 8q11.21  –  23,
10p15.3 – 14, 14q32.33, 16p13.13, 17q24.2, 20q13.2 and
20q13.21.
Deletions with a frequency of more than 50% were
detected in chromosomal regions: 8p21.2, 16q21 – 24.1
and 17p13.3  –  17p11.2. Deletion of regions: 4p14,
8p23.3  –  21.1, 11q22.1  –  24.3, 13q14.11  –  14.3,
13q14.2 – 14.3, 14q32.11 – 32.31, 16q12.1 – 13, 16q24.

tumor samples in relation to the corresponding MDR gene
expression and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

MDR gene locus deletions associated with lack of
13q14.2 region

MDR gene expression profiling and detection of tumorassociated copy number variations in DNA of the same
tumors were performed. The list of investigated MDR
genes included the main ABC family transporters АВСВ1,
АВСВ3, АВСС1, АВСС2, АВСС5, ABCG1, ABCG2 and
MVP. The corresponding MDR gene loci that were deleted
in the tumors are also listed in Table 1.
Among the patients who had tumors with deletions
of MDR gene loci, 75%–100% persons appeared to
display down-regulation of the expression of the same
MDR gene (the decrease in gene expression in post- NAC
tumor samples compared to the matched pre-NAC
specimens). It should be noted that only in 9%–49%
of patients who showed down-regulation of MDR gene
expression during the NAC had loci deletions (Table 1).
All patients (100%) with deletions of the АВСВ1,
АВСВ3 and ABCC5 gene loci, 7q21.1, 6p21.32 and 3q27,
respectively, were found to respond favorably to NAC.
The clinical response to NAC in BC patients showing
АВСС1 (16p13.1), АВСС2 (10q24), ABCG1 (21q22.3)
and ABCG2 (4q22.1) gene loci deletions varied little,
ranging from 62% to 88%.
The frequency of tumors with one or more loci
containing ABC family genes equals to 61% (14/23) in
CAX treated patients, 56% (20/36) in FAC regimen and
36% (5/14) in taxotere based regimen (p > 0.05 Fisher
test). The frequency of clinical response to NAC was
appeared to correlate with the number of deleted loci
containing ABC genes. Tumor response was detected
in 83–100% patients who had deletions in 2–5 ABC
genes (Table 2). No difference in the frequency of
response to NAC between tumors having no deletions
and tumors with deletion in only one ABC transporter
gene was found.
These data confirm good associations between MDR
loci deletions and NAC efficiency.

The next step was to examine the CNV in the
cytogenetic bands that most often occurred in tumors
with MDR loci deletions. All patients were divided into
two groups: the first group consisted of patients who had
at least one of the observed MDR gene locus deletions
(n = 34), the second group included patients who did not
have deletions in MDR gene loci (n = 34). Figure 2 shows
the frequency of patients with all CNVs that were detected
in all 852 chromosomal cytobands among the patients
with a deletion in the MDR gene loci (Figure  2A) and
those without deletions (Figure 2B). The analysis of all
CNVs, including amplifications and deletions showed that
the frequency of the 13q14.2 deletion was 85% (29/34)
among patients bearing a tumor with a deletion at least
in one MDR gene locus. In patients who had no deletions
of MDR gene loci, 13q14.2 loss was detected in only 9%
(3/34) of cases. Differences in the frequency of 13q14.2
deletions between the two groups were statistically
significant (p = 2.03 × 10–11, Fisher test, Bonferroniadjusted p = 1.73 × 10–8).
Thus, our findings show that MDR gene deletion
appears to down-regulate the expression of the
corresponding gene in 75–100% of patients and provide
good clinical response to NAC in 62–100% of cases.
However, the reduction in MDR gene expression within
breast tumors after NAC is not always associated with
deletion of MDR gene loci. Expression of the MDR
gene was found to be lower in patients with a deletion
than in those with no deletion only in post-NAC tumor
samples. No effect of a deletion on the level of MDR gene
expression was revealed in tumor samples of patients
before chemotherapy. Deletion of chromosomal region
13q14.2 occurred in 85% patients lacking the MDR gene
within a tumor.

MDR gene deletions affect gene expression in
post-NAC tumor samples

DISCUSSION

The next step was to assess whether the existence
of a deletion in the chromosome region in which MDR
genes were located affected their expression in tumors
before and after NAC. We examined the MDR gene
expression level in pre-NAC and post-NAC tumor
samples in patients who had MDR gene deletions versus
patients without deletions (Table 3). We did not find
any differences in the expressions of examined gene
between the tumors with and without deletions, collected
before NAC. However, measurement of the MDR
gene expression in post-NAC samples showed that the
expression level was 2.5 to 7.5 times lower in tumors
lacking the MDR gene loci than in tumors without the
deletion. Significant differences were revealed for the
expression levels of ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCG1
and ABCG2 genes (Table 3).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In accordance with numerous data the increased
expression of MDR genes is the expected response to
chemotherapy [27–30]. In our previous study we have
also demonstrated NAC induced up-regulated expression
of MDR genes in breast cancer patients. We have shown
the correlation between up-regulation of MDR gene
expression and resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
In contrast, in the group with tumor responses, we found
a statistically significant down-regulation of expression
of ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC5, ABCG1, ABCG2
and MVP genes following chemotherapy in breast cancer
patients [6], and a decrease in MDR protein expression
was revealed by Kim et al. (2013) [18]. Results of this
study suggested that deletion of the MDR gene locus in
tumors might be one of the causes of down-regulation of
MDR gene expression during chemotherapy.

The clinical response to NAC – complete response + partial response.
The obtained data indicated that tumors with a
deletion of at least one gene locus are sensitive to NAC.
A good NAC clinical response rate in patients with MDR
locus deletion ranged from 62% to 100% for different
genes, thus reflecting the close correlation between MDR
gene locus deletions and good response to NAC. This
finding is consistent with the data of Flahaut et al., (2006),
who showed that the neuroblastoma cell lines IGRN-91
and LAN-1R with a deletion of the 7q region demonstrated
a good response to doxorubicin chemotherapy [31].
However, only a few studies have investigated the loss
of the MDR gene in relation to the corresponding gene
expression and chemosensitivity of tumors. In contrast,
the amplification of gene loci in the context of multidrug
resistance has been more widely discussed. It is shown
that the amplification of MDR gene loci endows tumor cell
lines with chemoresistance, and elevated levels of MDR

gene expression after repeated chemotherapy courses have
been determined [31–34].
To understand whether deletion of MDR genecontaining chromosomal loci in tumors could be related
to initial or chemotherapy-induced (acquired) drug
resistance, we examined the expression of these genes
before NAC and after chemotherapy. Because the
expression level of the studied MDR genes in tumor
samples collected before chemotherapy did not depend
on the presence of MDR gene loci deletion (see Table 3),
it may be proposed that haplotype insufficiency of
the MDR gene locus in tumor cells cannot manifest
itself before chemotherapy. However, under the
influence of chemotherapeutic agents that activate ABC
transporter efflux, we observed decreased MDR gene
expression levels in tumors with a MDR gene deletion
(see  Table  3). Taking into account that the most well
7833

known mechanisms of MDR gene expression regulation
aimed at the activation of their expression in response
to chemotherapy, the question as to how the gene allelic
deletion leads to down-regulation of MDR expression
after NAC remains unclear. Several mechanisms that
would allow this MDR gene expression decrease can
be assumed. The first could be provided by allelic
deletions resulting in a deficit of an ABC gene and
subsequent protein expression in tumor cells in response
to chemotherapy. Low levels of ABC transporters cannot
sufficiently eliminate drugs, allowing tumor cells to
become sensitive to chemotherapy and die. Tumor cell

number reduction due to cell death also contributes to
decreasing the total expression of the MDR gene.
The second mechanism could be related to various
signaling pathways and transcription factors that are
known to influence the response to ABC family genes
mediated by MDR, including the Ras-mediated pathway,
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein
kinase A (PKA) pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, Y-box binding
protein 1 (YB-1), phosphatase and tensin homologue
(PTEN), p53, protein kinase C and other protein kinases
[35]. When these pathways are deregulated, no gene

expression activation will be provided in response to
chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy is known to induce the cellular stress
response. Leung and Sharp (2010) reported an interesting
mechanism for the regulation of gene expression by
microRNAs within stress-related conditions [36]. In
the cells, a basal level of target mRNA expression and,
simultaneously, a certain constant level of microRNAs,
which down-regulate the target mRNA, is maintained,
endowing their expression to be kept at a constant level.
A level of target mRNA (e.g., the MDR mRNA) is
dramatically raised following a stress response, saturating
the threshold microRNA that results in its insufficiency to
disrupt the mRNA and allows its translation. MDR gene
haplotype insufficiency leads to a slow increase in the
mRNA level in response to chemotherapy and does not
have sufficient time to saturate the threshold microRNAs.
As a result of deleted MDR genes, their expression in
tumor cells is not sufficiently increased in response to
treatment, and the tumor becomes chemosensitive.
Our data showed a high frequency (85%) of deletion
in the 13q14.2 region in tumors, with the loss of at least of
one MDR gene locus (see Figure 1). These data indicate
that genes located in the 13q14.2 locus could regulate
MDR gene expression when the MDR allelic deletion
occurs. Therefore, loss of the 13q14.2 locus can be a
marker of the MDR gene deletion in tumors. Because
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

deletion of the 13q14.2 locus can be easily detected by
PCR, this marker is potentially available for clinical use
to predict chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients.
The 13q14.2 locus is a region of chromosome 13 in which
2 gene loci, 28 protein-coding genes, 23 pseudogenes and
19 RNA genes are localized (http://www.genecards.org/).
The tumor suppressor retinoblastoma1 (RB1) gene is the
most famous among the protein-coding genes, and our
results indicate that RB1 haplotype insufficiency occurs
in 85% of patients with a deletion of MDR gene loci. RB1
loss is thought to function as a driver of mutations in this
group, and this has been experimentally confirmed by
Jiang, Jones et al. (2011) [37].
RB1 has been shown to inhibit the E2F1 and E2F2
transcriptional factors [38]; therefore, the allelic deletion
of RB1 that was observed in 85% of breast cancer patients
in our study is likely to lead to the activation of E2F1
and E2F2. However, evidence suggests that the ABCB1
gene promoter does not contain E2F1 and E2F2 binding
sites [39]. Moreover, E2F1 and/or E2F2 gene deletions
were detected in 18 of 34 (52%) patients who lacked the
13q14.2 locus, which should decrease their expression.
In addition, a recent report shows that Histone
Deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and 2) have a reciprocal
relationship to RB1 and are able to reduce ABCB1
and ABCC2 gene and protein expression in colorectal
adenocarcinoma and carcinoma cell lines [40]. pRb has

been reported to recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes,
such as HDAC1, through LXCXE motif-binding E2F
transcription factors and inhibit HDAC1 [38]. It can be
assumed that haplotype deficiency of the RB1 gene in
tumors of patients with a MDR gene deletion results in
increased activity of HDAC1 and 2, which, in turn, reduces
the expression of the MDR genes. Further study is needed
to understand why RB1 gene deletions are associated with
the loss of MDR gene loci.
The present study is believed to be the first
to investigate the association between MDR gene
deletions, down-regulation of the expression of the
same gene and good clinical response to NAC. A
close relationship between the loss of chromosomal
loci containing the MDR gene and tumor response to
chemotherapy shows the feasibility of using the MDR
gene loci deletion as a prognostic assay to predict tumor
response to NAC.

within 24  hours at +4°C and then at –80°C per the
manufacturer’s instructions until further use. Histological
diagnosis was confirmed for all samples.

RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from 68 samples of
pre- and post-NAC tumor tissues using RNeasy Plus
Mini Kit DNase I digestion (Qiagen, Germany #74134),
and RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Fermentas, Lithuania
#EO0382) was added to the isolated RNA. Five patients
showed a complete response, rendering it impossible
to obtain further tumor samples. The RNA integrity
number (RIN) was measured using the 2200 TapeStation
Instrument and R6K ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies,
USA #5067–5367). RNA with an RIN > 7 was reverse
transcribed to cDNA using the RevertAid Kit with random
hexanucleotide primers (Fermentas, Thermo Scientific
#K1691) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Expression analysis

Patients, tumors and treatments

The MDR gene expression was assayed in
pre- NAC and post-NAC tumor samples (pre-treatment
expression and post-treatment expression). The
expression levels of the MDR genes were measured
using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based
on the TaqMan technology with a Rotor-Gene-6000
instrument (Corbett Research, Australia) as described
in detail in [6]. The primer and probe sequences of
ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC5, ABCG2, MVP and
GAPDH were given in our previous study [6]; and the
primer and probe sequences of ABCB2 and ABCG1 were
obtained from a previous paper [43]. One internal gene,
GAPDH, was used to normalize the expression levels
of the studied genes. The average Ct (cycle threshold)
was estimated for the gene of interest and GAPDH,
the relative expression was evaluated using the Pfaffl
method [44], and a formula was used to determine the
expression ratio between the sample and the calibrator
[6]. The relative expression level was also normalized
to a calibrator consisting of a pool of normal breast
tissue specimens. For this purpose, adjacent normal
breast tissue specimens from 10 breast cancer patients
(NAC-free) were used as a source of normal RNA. The
results were presented as n-fold differences in MDR
gene expression relative to GAPDH and normal breast
tissue.

Breast cancer patients (n = 73) with clinical stage
IIA to IIIC (T1–4N0–3M0), in the age range between 26 and
69 years (median age 52.1 ± 0.46) were treated at the
Cancer Research Institute (Tomsk, Russia) between 2006
and 2012 (Table 4).
The procedures followed in this study were made in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration (1964, amended
in 1975 and 1983). This study was approved by the
institutional review board, and all patients signed an
informed consent for voluntary participation.
All patients received two to four cycles of systemic
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the FAC (5-Fluorourail,
Adriamycin, and Cyclophosphamide) or CAX
(Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Xeloda) regimens or
Taxotere. Physical examination was performed before
NAC and was repeated after two cycles of NAC and
before surgery to determine the clinical response.
Imaging of the primary breast lesion was performed
with mammography and/or ultrasonography, and clinical
and imaging responses were categorized according to
the International Union Against Cancer criteria [42]. In
this way, patients were grouped into clinical responders
(CR and PR) and non-responders (SD and PD). Surgery
(radical resection, sectoral resection or mastectomy)
was performed within three to four weeks after the last
administration of chemotherapy in responsive patients.
After surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal
therapy was given, and fresh breast cancer tissues were
obtained during the initial diagnostic biopsy (~10 mm3)
before NAC and in the course of tumor resection after
NAC (~60–70 mm3). The obtained tissue samples were
stored in RNALater solution (Ambion, USA #AM- 7020)

DNA isolation
DNA was extracted from 68 samples of preNAC tumor tissues using the QIAamp DNA mini Kit
(Qiagen, Germany #51304), and the DNA concentration
and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop-2000
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The

concentration level ranged from 50 to 150 ng/µl; the
А260/А280  =  2.10–2.35; and the А260/А230  =  2.15–2.40.
The integrity was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis
using the 2200 TapeStation Instrument and Agilent
Genomic DNA ScreenTape System Quick Guide (Agilent
Technologies, USA # 5067–5365). The DNA mass was
greater than 48 kbp.

In nearly all cases, CNV were mosaic, i.e., mutant
tumor DNA was detected along with the normal DNA.
Additionally, the percentage of mutant DNA copy
number state (CN-state) ranged from 15 to 88%. The
Chromosome Analysis Suite 2.0 software graphically
presents mosaicism as allele peaks with 4 bands
(AAA,  AAB, ABB, BBB). The snpQC value ranged
from 13 to 25 and negatively correlated with the CNV
frequency. Even if the snpQC values were low, the
width of the allele peaks was “good” (according to the
progenetix resource [45]) for CNV identification.

Microarray analysis
To study CNVs of MDR gene loci, microarray
analysis was performed using high density microarray
platform Affymetrix (USA) CytoScanTM HD Array,
(http://www.affymetrix.com/esearch/search. jsp?pd=
prod520004&N=4294967292). The array contained
2.67 million markers, 1.9 million non-polymorphic
markers and more than 750  000 single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) markers that allowed structural
variations of more than 36 000 genes to be determined.
The presence of SNP markers on the microarray enabled
copy number analysis to detect gains and losses in
the DNA and loss of heterozygosity. Procedures of
sample preparation, hybridization and scanning were
performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
protocol using the system Affymetrix GeneChip®
Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, USA). The Chromosome
Analysis Suite 2.0 software (Affymetrix, USA), which
is specifically devised for analyzing microarray results
from the CytoScanTM HD Array, was used. Unbalanced
chromosomal aberrations (deletions and amplifications,
or Loss and Gain) were detected in chromosomal regions
3q27.1, 4q22.1, 6p21.3, 7q21.12, 10q24.2, 16p13.11,
16p11.2 and 21q22.3. Because stromal elements and
other normal cells were presented in tumor tissue
samples, the percentage of normal genomic DNA was
high in the obtained DNA. The Microchip CytoScanTM
HD Array can detect at least 5% of mutant DNA.

Real-time PCR
Specific target sequences were selected for realtime quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the VectorNTI 11.5
software (Life Technologies, USA). Two primers and
probe were created for each lost chromosomal region.
The sequence of the primers is shown in Table 5. We
used CASR (calcium-sensing receptor) as a reference
gene because it is localized in 3q13.33 region with low
frequency of CNVs that points the reduced risk of DNA
loss and gain (see Figure 1).

Statistical analysis
The presence of structural CNV in MDR gene
loci was assessed using the Chromosome Analysis
Suite 2.0 software. Statistical analyses were performed
using the STATISTICA 8.0 software (StatSoft, Tulsa,
OK, USA). The arithmetic mean value and standard
error were calculated for each sample group, and
Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to identify the
link between the expression levels of MDR genes in
breast tumors and the presence/absence of deletion
in the MDR loci. A two-sided p-value was calculated
