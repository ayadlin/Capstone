ABSTRACT
The case study reported on acquired bevacizumab resistance in one patient
receiving re-treatment with bevacizumab following radiation brain necrosis
progression after bevacizumab was discontinued. This case offers novel and additional
insight for bevacizumab treatment. Low-dose bevacizumab is effective for radiation
brain necrosis, and radiation brain necrosis may progress after bevacizumab
discontinuation, whereas too many cycles of bevacizumab treatment may induce
drug-resistance and re-treatment failure following the progression. Therefore, more
rational administration for radiation brain necrosis with bevacizumab may include
three aspects: short-course treatment, timely discontinuation upon obtaining
satisfactory effects (to prevent long-term medication associated resistance) and retreatment after brain necrosis progression.

Efficacy of bevacizumab in treating radiation brain
necrosis has been reported in many studies [1-8], however,
hardly any data about acquired bevacizumab resistance in
patients re-treated with bevacizumab following radiation
brain necrosis progression after the drug discontinued
is presented. In this paper, we report one case of such
acquired resistance following treatment with bevacizumab
for radiation brain necrosis.
A 56-year-old female patient was admitted to our
hospital in August 2011 with a complaint of cough and
hemoptysis for 6 months, and dizziness for 1 month.
She received a diagnosis of left lung adenocarcinoma
with metastasis in the mediastinal lymph nodes and
left parietal lobe at clinical stage IV, T1N2M1. Genetic
testing showed mutations in the EGFR19 exons and
she was prescribed oral erlotinib. In February 2012, she

exhibited symptoms including dizziness and nausea, and
underwent CyberKnife stereotactic radiotherapy of the
left parietal metastasis. The gross tumor volume (GTV)
was determined using enhanced computed tomography
(CT), and the planning target volume (PTV) considered
an area of 1.5 mm from GTV. Furthermore, 85% of the
radiation dose (total dose 36Gy/3f) targeted the PTV.
A follow-up in April 2012 showed that the intracranial
metastasis was smaller with a symptom improvement. In
September 2012, however, she developed symptoms such
as headache and dizziness again, and a follow-up with
enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed
a significantly larger lesion represented with map-like
enhancement and a large edema area in the surrounding
tissue. She was further diagnosed with radiation brain
necrosis based on the spectroscopy. From September

2012 to July 2013, she received 10 cycles of bevacizumab
treatment (5 mg/kg, q3w-4w, she weighed about 60 kg
and we gave her 300mg once). During the treatment,
MRI and MRS tests showed that the brain necrosis was
significantly improved after she took bevacizumab.
Her symptoms disappeared, and bevacizumab was
discontinued. In June 2014, she exhibited headache and

dizziness again. Brain MRI showed significant progression
of necrosis lesion compared with the results in July
2013, and spectroscopy indicated brain necrosis further.
From August 2014 to March 2015, she received a total
of 7 cycles of bevacizumab treatment (using the same
administration as before; she did not take bevacizumab on
June 10, 2014 because of persistent bleeding and delayed

brain MRI showed map-like enhancement and a large edema in the surrounding tissue. Based on the three results (A, B and C), the patient
was diagnosed with radiation brain necrosis, and received 10 cycles of bevacizumab at 300 mg, q3-4w* from September 2012 to July 2013.

As indicated, during the bevacizumab treatment, multiple follow-up visits showed a significant improvement in brain necrosis after the
bevacizumab treatment applied, and the lesion remained relatively stable.

healing after fingernail extraction due to severe tarcevainduced paronychia). However, the cerebral edema-related
symptoms did not significantly improve at that time; and
bevacizumab was discontinued in March 2015. A brain
MRI performed in March 2015 showed no significant
improvement in brain necrosis from June 2014, and
spectroscopy still indicated radiation brain necrosis.

believed that bevacizumab resistance is caused by
hypoxia due to bevacizumab over-pruning new vessels,
however the over-pruning theory was only supported by
few literatures and not mature and convincing enough,
making the excessive pruning is only one potential
mechanism [12-14]. Moreover, bevacizumab regimen
also needs further consideration. It is more rational that
bevacizumab is given in short-course, stopped timely
upon obtaining satisfactory effects (to prevent long-term
medication associated resistance) and re-prescribed after
brain necrosis progression.

DISCUSSION
Many previous studies have shown that development
of brain necrosis is closely related to vascular injury
and angiogenesis [9-11]. As an anti-angiogenesis drug,
bevacizumab can prune vessels and regulate vascular
permeability, and studies have demonstrated that it
relieves brain necrosis associated cerebral hydropic
symptoms. The current case also validates the efficacy
of bevacizumab treatments, and offers additionally novel
insight further. Firstly, the patient received bevacizumab at
300mg, q3-4w, with good results, which shows that lowdose bevacizumab can produce satisfactory short-term
outcome for radiation brain necrosis. Secondly, radiation
brain necrosis may progress following bevacizumab
discontinuation, which is consistent with the previous
consensus that necrosis is irreversible in theory once
formed. Besides, the patient received a relatively more
cycles of bevacizumab treatment (10 cycles) during the
initial therapy. It is believed that the patient was likely
to develop acquired bevacizumab resistance which
contributed to re-treatment failure following the cerebral
necrosis progression, although some other researchers
