ABSTRACT
Acquired proteasome-inhibitor (PI) resistance is a major obstacle in the
treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated whether the clinical XPO1inhibitor selinexor, when combined with bortezomib or carfilzomib, could overcome
acquired resistance in MM. PI-resistant myeloma cell lines both in vitro and in vivo
and refractory myeloma patient biopsies were treated with selinexor/bortezomib or
carfilzomib and assayed for apoptosis. Mechanistic studies included NFkB pathway
protein expression assays, immunofluorescence microscopy, ImageStream flowcytometry, and proximity-ligation assays. IkBa knockdown and NFkB activity were
measured in selinexor/bortezomib-treated MM cells. We found that selinexor restored
sensitivity of PI-resistant MM to bortezomib and carfilzomib. Selinexor/bortezomib
treatment inhibited PI-resistant MM tumor growth and increased survival in mice.
Myeloma cells from PI-refractory MM patients were sensitized by selinexor to
bortezomib and carfilzomib without affecting non-myeloma cells. Immunofluorescence
microscopy, Western blot, and ImageStream analyses of MM cells showed increases
in total and nuclear IkBa by selinexor/bortezomib. Proximity ligation found increased
IkBa-NFkB complexes in treated MM cells. IkBa knockdown abrogated selinexor/
bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells. Selinexor/bortezomib treatment
decreased NFkB transcriptional activity. Selinexor, when used with bortezomib or
carfilzomib, has the potential to overcome PI drug resistance in MM. Sensitization
may be due to inactivation of the NFkB pathway by IkBa.

to the topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibitor doxorubicin
[3, 5]. In addition, we found that XPO1 inhibitors are
able to prevent nuclear export and promote nuclear
accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 [3,
5]. XPO1 inhibitors, when used in combination with the
proteasome inhibitors (PI) bortezomib and carfilzomib,
were found to synergistically kill multiple myeloma
(MM) cells and when co-cultured with bone marrow

INTRODUCTION
Cancer cells utilize the process of nuclearcytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore
complex to effectively evade anti-cancer mechanisms
[1–5]. We have shown that knockdown of exportin 1
(XPO1/CRM1) protein by siRNA or with an XPO1
inhibitor will sensitize drug-resistant myeloma cells

RESULTS

stromal cells [5, 6]. Our studies have shown that MM
patient bone marrow mononuclear cells, when cotreated with an XPO1 inhibitor and PIs, synergistically
induced apoptosis in MM cell populations but not in
non-myeloma bone marrow cells, indicating that XPO1
inhibition may specifically inhibit cancer cells in MM
patients [4, 5]. These studies were the first to report
cancer cell-specific apoptosis by combinations of XPO1
with PI. However, acquired drug-resistance results in cell
lines, in vitro and in vivo, and ex vivo in PI-refractory
patients have not been investigated in MM.
Recent publications have indicated that XPO1
inhibitors, especially the orally available clinical
compound selinexor (KPT-330), may be effective against
various hematologic malignancies, including leukemia [7–
12], mantle cell lymphoma [13, 14], and MM [5, 10, 15].
High levels of XPO1 may be associated with
decreased event-free and overall survival in MM
[10]. Recent studies in MM have shown that XPO1
protein levels are increased in plasma cells from newly
diagnosed MM patients compared with normal plasma
cells [10, 15] or with plasma cells from those with
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
and smoldering MM [15]. XPO1 mRNA is also increased
in bortezomib-treated patient samples [10]. In addition,
when treated with XPO1 inhibitors, 21 different human
MM cell lines were found to have decreased cell viability
[3, 5, 10, 15]. XPO1 inhibitors in human MM have been
shown to inhibit the export of the following cancerrelated proteins or mRNAs from the nucleus: c-myc,
CDC25A, BRD4, p53, Mcl-1, BCl-xL, NFκB, p21,
p27, IκB, FOXO3A, FOXO1A, PP2A, PUMA, BAX,
CHOP, C1-0orf10, MIC1, IL-6, VEGF, MIP1ß, and IL10 [5, 10, 15].
What has not been addressed in previous studies
is whether XPO1 inhibitors are effective in overcoming
acquired drug-resistant MM phenotypes, which develop
in patients during treatment with PIs. In patients
with MM, drug resistance is the primary limitation
to successful treatment. Myeloma is still considered
incurable despite significant advances afforded by
immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide,
pomalidomide), PIs (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib),
antibodies targeting SLAMF7 protein (elotuzumab) and
CD38 (daratumumab), histone deacetylase inhibitors
(panobinostat), and high-dose melphalan with autologous
stem cell rescue.
In the present study, we show that XPO1 inhibition
sensitized acquired PI-resistant MM cells to bortezomib
and carfilzomib in both in vitro and in vivo models and
ex vivo in PI-refractory patient CD138+/light chain+
MM cells, thus showing that this combination may
provide a means to overcoming acquired drug resistance
in MM.

XPO1 inhibition sensitizes PI-resistant MM cell
lines to bortezomib and carfilzomib
Apoptosis results (flow cytometry using activated
caspase 3) from human PI-resistant and parental MM
cells after 20-hour concurrent treatment with selinexor
(300 nM) or KOS-2464 (10 nM) ± bortezomib (10 nM)
or carfilzomib (20 nM) are shown in Figure 1. Both
U266 and 8226 parental cell lines were highly sensitive
to single-drug treatment with bortezomib or carfilzomib
at log-phase growth densities (5 x 105 cells/mL). PIresistant U266PSR and 8226B25 MM cell lines [16, 17]
were resistant to single-agent bortezomib (up to 10-fold)
or carfilzomib (up to 9-fold) when compared to parental
cells (Figure 1). When the XPO1 inhibitor selinexor was
added, both U266PSR and 8226B25 PI-resistant cells
were highly sensitized to bortezomib (P = 0.00055 and P
= 0.0054, respectively) or carfilzomib (P = 0.0017 and P
= 0.0033, respectively) treatment compared with singleagent treatment (Figure 1). Equivalent results were found
when PIs were used with the XPO1 inhibitor KOS-2464
[18] (Figure 1).

In vivo NOD/SCID-γ mouse studies with
selinexor and bortezomib
In our mouse studies, we used both PI-resistant
(U266PSR) and parental U266 human MM cells.
U266PSR cells have been shown to be up to 10-fold
resistant to bortezomib and up to 9-fold resistant to
carfilzomib (Figure 1) [16, 17, 19]. As shown in Figure
2A, bortezomib combined with selinexor resulted in
reduced U266 MM tumor growth versus single-agent
bortezomib (P = 0.022), selinexor (P = 0.033), or vehicle
control (P = 0.00051) (Figure 2A). NOD/SCID-γ mice
challenged with PI-resistant U266PSR MM tumors also
had reduced tumor growth with selinexor/bortezomib
compared with single-agent bortezomib (P = 0.0006),
selinexor (P = 0.018), or vehicle control (P = 0.0014)
(Figure 2C). Combining bortezomib and selinexor
improved survival in mice with U266 MM tumors
compared with single-agent bortezomib (P = 0.0072),
selinexor (P = 0.0010), or vehicle (P = 0.0006) (Figure
2B). Survival in mice with PI-resistant U266PSR tumors
improved with selinexor/bortezomib treatment compared
with single-agent bortezomib (P = 0.0072), selinexor (P
= 0.0010), or vehicle (P = 0.0006) (Figure 2D). At the end
of the study (125 days), 60% of U226 parental and 50%
of U266PSR challenged mice treated with bortezomib
and selinexor were tumor-free, all other treatment groups
did not survive. Toxicity, assessed by weight loss, was
minimal in all treatment groups.

and PI-refractory patient MM cells with
selinexor and KOS-2464 sensitizes cells to
bortezomib and carfilzomib

(n=8)/carfilzomib (n=6) refractory MM patient samples
were sensitized by selinexor and KOS-2464 to both
bortezomib (P = 0.043 to 0.002) and carfilzomib (P =
0.044 to 0.001) (Figure 3A, 3C, and 3E). When gating
on the CD138/light-chain double-negative non-myeloma
cells, we found that they were not sensitized to apoptosis
by XPO1 inhibitors (Figure 3B, 3D, and 3F). These data
indicate that myeloma cells were targeted by the XPO1
inhibitor/PI drug combination and that non-myeloma cells
were relatively unaffected.

Using flow cytometry, we gated on the CD138/
light-chain immunoglobulin double-positive myeloma cell
population in patient bone marrow aspirates. Apoptosis, as
measured by activated caspase 3 expression showed that

20 h with selinexor (300 nM) or KOS-2464 (10 nM) +/- BTZ (20 nM) or +/- CFZ (30 nM) and assayed for apoptosis by flow cytometry
(activated caspase 3). Resistant MM cell lines were up to 10-fold resistant to single-agent BTZ or CFZ compared with parental cells. The

induced NFκB-IκBα complex formation

NFκB-IκBα binding may result in inactivation of NFκB
transcriptional activity, decreased cell proliferation, and
increased apoptosis (Figure 4B) [20–22].

Proximity ligation assays (n=2) were performed
as described under Materials and Methods. In this assay,
an NFκB-IκBα complex formation will produce a red
fluorescent signal when NFκB and IκBα are in close
proximity (<40 nM). PI-resistant and parental cells treated for
6 hours with vehicle (1% DMSO), selinexor, or bortezomib
as single agents produced very few NFκB-IκBα complexes;
however, the combination of selinexor/bortezomib increased
NFκB-IκBα co-localization 12-fold more than untreated cells
and 10-fold and 5-fold more than single-agent bortezomib
and selinexor, respectively (Figure 4A). Increased nuclear

that are refractory to PIs. These data strongly suggest that
selinexor, when combined with PIs, may be an effective
therapy for PI-resistant MM.
Previous studies have shown that IκBα is a tumor
suppressor that dimerizes with NFκB and prevents its
transcriptional activity, thus decreasing NFκB-driven
proliferation and increased apoptosis in MM cells [20, 23].
Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to inhibit NFκB
activity through stabilization of IκBα [21]. In addition
XPO1 inhibition by leptomycin B has been shown to
sequester NFκB-IκBα complexes in the nucleus. These
complexes are unable to bind DNA in the nucleus and

DISCUSSION
Our findings show that XPO1 inhibitors, when
used in combination with PIs, are highly effective against
acquired PI-resistant human MM in in vitro assays with
PI-resistant cell lines, in vivo in mice challenged with
PI-resistant MM tumors, and ex vivo in patient MM cells

activate NFκB transcriptional activity [22]. We found
that the combination treatment of an XPO1 inhibitor
(selinexor) and a PI (bortezomib) synergistically increased
IκBα more than single-agent selinexor or bortezomib
treatment in both parental and PI-resistant MM cell lines
and in patient myeloma cells. This observed synergistic
increase in IκBα expression by selinexor and bortezomib
resulted in a strong anti-tumor effect. Proximity ligation
assays showed that NFκB-IκBα complexes were
significantly increased in cells treated with the selinexor
and bortezomib combination, further indicating that
NFκB is inactivated by PI and XPO1 inhibitor treatment.
Therefore, inhibition of NFκB by upregulating IκBα

protein and subsequent creation of NFκB-IκBα complexes
may be, at least in part, the mechanism behind proteasome
inhibition and XPO1 inhibitor anti-tumor synergy. In
evidence of this mechanism, we found that siRNA
knockdown of IκBα significantly decreased the effect
of selinexor, as shown by 10- to 25-fold increase in IC50
values, and knockdown significantly reduced selinexor/
bortezomib-induced apoptosis. In addition selinexor/
bortezomib treatment was shown to abrogate NFκB
transcriptional activity.
In a companion report in this issue, Kashyap et al
examined the combination of selinexor with PIs in sarcoma
cell lines. They report that the combination treatment of

cells were treated with selinexor for 72 hours and IC50 determined. IκBα knockdown reduced toxicity to KPT-330 compared with control
siRNA in both IM-9 (P = 0.023) and 8226 (P = 0.0062) cells. B. 8226, 8226B25, and H929 human MM cells were transfected with 40 nM
IκBα siRNA. 48 hours after transfection, scram siRNA control and IκBα siRNA knockdown cells were treated with 100 nM selinexor ±
BTZ. IκBα knockdown reduced apoptosis (activated caspase 3) in selinexor/BTZ-treated cells (P = 0.0086) compared with control siRNA.

exposed to 20 ng/mL of TNFα for 4 hours in serum-free media. TNFα exposure induced NFκB transcriptional activity 6-fold. Single-agent
selinexor (P = 0.000023) and BTZ (P = 0.00024) lowered NFκB transcriptional activity, and the combination of selinexor and BTZ further
reduced the activity to 3-fold below baseline (P = 0.00013) (no TNFα). (Inset) Western blots of protein from 8226 selinexor/bortezomibtreated cells showed a decrease in NFκB-mediated IAP-1 (84%), IAP-2 (72.8%), c-Myc (62%), and cyclin D2 (42%) protein expression
compared with untreated controls. Protein loading was confirmed by GAPDH expression.

Drug-resistant cell lines treated with XPO1
inhibitors and bortezomib or carfilzomib

selinexor with bortezomib sensitizes the sarcoma cells
to the cytotoxic effects of PIs. In addition, this report
highlights the importance of the NFκB signaling pathway
in cancer, especially the role of the inhibition of NFκB or
IκBα by selinexor/bortezomib treatment.
Selinexor, an orally active selective inhibitor of
XPO1-mediated nuclear export (SINE), is currently
undergoing phase I/II studies in a variety of indications,
including a combination with carfilzomib, in both
relapsed and refractory MM patients (NCT02199665).
The results presented in this study support combinatorial
clinical trials in relapsed and refractory MM that utilize
PI therapies.

Parental and drug-resistant human 8226, 8226B25,
U266, and U266PSR MM cells were grown at lowdensity (log growth phase) conditions (3-4 ×105 cells/mL)
and cultured for 20 hours with either 300 nM selinexor
(Karyopharm Therapeutics) or 10 nM KOS-2464 (BristolMyers Squibb) with and without 10 nM bortezomib (LC
Labs), or 20 nM carfilzomib (SelleckChem). Optimal
drug concentrations were determined by titration
experiments for bortezomib and carfilzomib. Cells were
fixed and permeabilized, and apoptosis was measured
using anti-activated caspase 3/Alexa Fluor 488 (Cell
Signaling Technology) staining in accordance with the
manufacturer’s standard protocol. Percent apoptosis was
assayed by flow cytometry on a LSRII (Becton-Dickinson)
bench-top analyzer. Data analysis was performed using
Flowjo version 9.4 software (Tree Star, Inc) [24].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
For human sample acquisition, written informed
consent approved by an Institutional Review Board
was obtained from all patients, in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient samples were deidentified and obtained through the Institutional Review
Board-approved Total Cancer Care® protocol at the
Moffitt Cancer Center.

NOD/SCID-γ mouse studies with selinexor ±
bortezomib
All mouse studies were reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC), Research Integrity & Compliance - Research
& Innovation at the University of South Florida.
Bortezomib-resistant U266PSR human myeloma cells
(106) were injected subcutaneously into flanks of female
NOD/SCID-γ mice, and tumors were allowed to grow
for 14 days before the start of treatment [19]. U266PSR
human myeloma tumors were treated twice weekly by
intraperitoneal injection with bortezomib (0.5 mg/kg) or
twice weekly by oral gavage with selinexor (10 mg/kg) or
in combination where selinexor treatment was followed 2
to 3 hours later by bortezomib injection. Five mice were
used per experimental group. Tumors were measured by
calipers, and tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated by the
formula (length x width2)/2. Mice were euthanized when
a tumor volume exceeded 2000 mm3 or if the mouse lost
>15% of its body weight. Drug toxicity was also assayed
by mouse weights with a decrease of ≥10% considered an

Human MM cell lines RPMI 8226 (8226), IM-9,
MM.1S, and U266 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). To establish
resistance of human MM cells to bortezomib, U266
and 8226 cells were continuously cultured in gradually
increased concentrations of bortezomib. To produce PIresistant U266 cells (U266PSR), bortezomib dosing
started at 0.5 nM, increasing in step-wise increments of
0.2 nM to 20 nM [16, 19]. To produce PI-resistant 8226
(8226B25) cells, bortezomib dosing started at 1.0 nM,
increasing in step-wise increments of 2.5 nM to 25 nM.
The U266PSR cell line expressed a modest increase in
Mcl-1, resulting in enhanced cell survival by inhibiting
apoptosis and markedly lower expression of the apoptosispromoting factor Bim [17]. Both of the bortezomib
resistant cell lines, U226PSR and 8226B25, are also
highly resistant to carfilzomib (see Figure 1).
U266PSR and 8226B25 cell lines were
authenticated by the Moffitt Cancer Center Molecular
Genomics Core Facility Cell lines using short tandem
repeat (STR) DNA typing according to ATCC's
“Authentication of Human Cell Lines: Standardization
of STR Profiling (2012).” Results were compared
with STR databases from ATCC and DSMZ (Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen,
GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) to establish percent
identity. Cell lines were considered authenticated when
the number of shared alleles across the eight core loci was
≥80% (as described by ATCC).

Bone marrow aspirate processing and apoptosis
assay of patient myeloma cells
As previously described, bone marrow aspirates
were collected from newly diagnosed (n=8), relapsed
(n=5), and PI-refractory bortezomib (n=8)/carfilzomib
(n=6) patients [5]. PI refractory is defined as patients who
progress during treatment or within 60 days after stopping
treatment with either bortezomib or carfilzomib. Bone
marrow aspirates (20 mL) from patients were isolated by
Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences) [5]. Cytospin
slides were used to determine the percent plasma cell

population by the microscopic morphology of toluidinestained cells [5].
Isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells from
the Ficoll-Paque fraction described above were also
incubated at 4 × 106/mL in 200 μL RPMI (Fisher)
containing 10% FBS in 96-well plates, treated with
either 300 nM selinexor or KOS-2464 with and without
10 nM bortezomib or 20 nM carfilzomib and incubated
for 20 hours in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The
following day, the cells were fixed and assayed for caspase
activation-mediated apoptosis. Bone marrow mononuclear
cells were fluorescently labeled with antibodies against
activated caspase 3 (ASP175-Alexa 488), CD138 (M115Alexa 647, BD Bioscience), and light-chain kappa (G20193 V450, BD Bioscience) or lambda (JDC-12 V450, BD
Bioscience). A BD Bioscience LSRII flow cytometer was
used to gate MM cell populations, defined as cells that
are both CD138 positive and light-chain positive. Nonmyeloma patient bone marrow cells were defined as cells
that were both CD138 and light-chain negative. Percent of
apoptotic cells from each sample was assayed by activated
caspase 3. Data analysis was performed using Flowjo
version 9.4 software (Tree Star, Inc).

intensity thresholds. Finally, the total number of foci per
nucleus and cytoplasm were analyzed for number and
area. This experiment was repeated 3 times. Western blots
were made of the treated cells at 4-6 hours for XPO1
expression (according to the methods described below).

Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western
blot of IκBα in selinexor/bortezomib-treated
drug-resistant MM cells and selinexor-treated
patient MM cells
Drug-resistant 8226B25 and U266PSR human MM
cells were incubated with selinexor (300 nM), bortezomib
(10 nM), or their combination for 20 hours to determine
their combined effects on IκBα expression by Western blot
and immunofluorescence microscopy.
Western immunoblotting was performed as
previously described [5]. Briefly, 100 μg of protein were
loaded into each lane of an 8% SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham)
overnight (30 V at 4ºC) with the use of a Bio-Rad MiniTransblot apparatus. Membranes were blocked, and
proteins were identified by incubation with specific
antibodies: anti-IκBα (ab32518, Abcam) and GAPDH
(clone 6C5 Millipore). Additional Western blots were
performed to measure NFκB-mediated protein expression
of anti-IAP-1 (Fisher PAS-29085), anti-IAP-2 (Fisher
PAS-22997), anti-Myc (Fisher MAI-980), and anti-cyclin
D2 (Fisher MA5-12731). All antibodies were used at
a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer (5% instant nonfat dry milk in PBS) for 1 hour at ambient temperature.
Membranes were washed, incubated with the appropriate
secondary IgG-horseradish peroxidase, and visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).
Immunofluorescence microscopy of cytospins
slides was performed as previously described [5] using
both PI-resistant and parental cell lines and on patient
MM samples (n = 6) after treatment with 300 nM
selinexor, 10 nM bortezomib, or in combination. AntiIκBα rabbit monoclonal antibody (Abcam) was used at
1:100 followed by incubation with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor
594 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody (1:500). In addition
patient bone marrow aspirate cytospins were stained with
anti-kappa (Millipore AP505F) or anti-lambda (Millipore
AP506F) light-chain FITC-conjugated antibodies to
identify MM cells. Slides were washed four times in PBS,
air dried, and covered with cover glass and Vectashield
mounting media containing antifade/DAPI (Vector
Laboratories Inc) to stain nuclei. Images were captured
with a high-resolution CCD camera mounted on a Zeiss
Automated Upright Fluorescent Microscope.

Proximity ligation assay
Log-phase MM cells, both parental and PI-resistant,
were placed at cell densities of 4 × 106 cells/mL and
treated with 300 nM selinexor for 4-6 hours. Cells were
washed with PBS, and cytospins were made with 105
cells/slide and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells
were incubated with primary antibodies to IκBα (E130/
Abcam) and NFκB (L8F6/Cell Signaling). Incubation
with the primary antibodies was followed by secondary
antibodies conjugated with oligonucleotides provided
in the Duolink kit (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden)
[25]. A red fluorescent signal was generated only when
IκBα and NFκB, were in close proximity (<40 nm). 4',
6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain
the nuclei. Samples were observed with a Leica TCS SP5
AOBS laser scanning confocal microscope through a
63X/1.4NA Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective lens
(Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Germany). We applied
405 diode, Argon 488, and HeNe 647 laser lines to excite
the samples, with tunable emissions used to minimize
crosstalk between fluorochromes. Z stack (0.5-μmthick slices) images for each sample were captured with
photomultiplier detectors, and maximum projections were
prepared with the LAS AF software version 2.6 (Leica
Microsystems).
Maximum projection images were analyzed using
the Definiens® Developer v2.0 (Definiens AG, Munich,
Germany) software suite. First, nuclei were segmented
with an auto-threshold segmentation on the DAPI stain.
Next, cytoplasms were segmented on the cellular autofluorescence in the green channel by using both size and

incubated for 20 hours. Cells were washed once in cold
PBS and fixed for 20 minutes on ice in cytofix/cytoperm
(BD Bioscience) solution. Cells were then pelleted and
resuspended in perm/wash (BD Bioscience) solution and
stored at 4°C. Treated cells (5 x105) and controls were
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with anti IκBα
(E130) (Abcam ab32518) diluted 1:50 in perm/wash (BD
Bioscience) solution. Cells were then washed in perm/
wash solution and incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa-488
diluted 1:250 and incubated for 45 minutes in the dark
at room temperature. DAPI (Sigma D21490) (5 nM) was
added to stain the nucleus immediately before analyses.
Flow cytometry was performed on an ImageStreamX
MKII high-speed imaging flow cytometer (Amnis
Corporation) to analyze intracellular fluorescence. Bright
field and fluorescent images were collected at a ×40
magnification. We assayed 10,000 gated cell singlets
from each sample. IDEAS Analysis Software (Amnis
Corporation) was used to determine nuclear location of
IκBα in the treated and untreated cells. The Similarity
Feature was used to determine nuclear location. Similarity
is the log-transformed Pearson correlation coefficient
and is a measure of the degree to which two images
are linearly correlated within a designated region. This
analysis uses the pixel data in the region that is specified
as “the nucleus” (DAPI) and compares the similarity when
other fluorochromes (IκBα) occupy the same pixel space.
A high positive similarity value indicates that the probes
are in the same location, whereas a high negative value
indicates they are in different locations. A value near
zero indicates there is an equal amount of probe in both
the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Values were obtained for
percent IκBα in the nucleus and cytoplasm in MM cells in
all drug treatment groups.

treatment 48 hours after transfection with selinexor 300
nM, bortezomib 10 nM, and the combination. After 20hour incubation with drugs, the cells were assayed by
flow cytometry for activated caspase 3 apoptosis as above
(n=2).
NFκB transcriptional activity was assayed in
MM.1S cells pretreated with 1 μM selinexor and/or 100
nM bortezomib for 2 hours and then exposed to 20 ng/mL
TNFα for 4 hours in serum-free media. TNFα exposure
induced NFκB transcriptional activity 6-fold as measured
by a chemiluminescent transcription factor assay kit
(Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 89859). TNFα-activated
NFκB p65 transcription factor binds to a biotinylated
consensus sequence plated on a 96-well plate. The plate is
developed using a primary antibody to NFκB p65 followed
by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody and developed with a chemoluminescent
substrate.

Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance was used to compare mouse
data sets. All other statistical comparisons were made
using the t test.
