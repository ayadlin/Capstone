Cellular responses to ;-irradiation exposure are controlled
by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related kinases (PIKK) in
the nucleus, and in addition, cytosolic PIKKs may have a
role in such responses. Here, we show that the expression of
tripeptidyl-peptidase II (TPPII), a high molecular weight
cytosolic peptidase, required PIKK signaling and that
TPPII was rapidly translocated into the nucleus of ;irradiated cells. These events were dependent on mammalian
target of rapamycin, a cytosolic/mitochondrial PIKK that is
activated by ;-irradiation. Lymphoma cells with inhibited
expression of TPPII failed to efficiently stabilize p53 and
had reduced ability to arrest proliferation in response to
;-irradiation. We observed that TPPII contains a BRCA
COOH-terminal–like motif, contained within sequences of
several proteins involved in DNA damage signaling pathways,
and this motif was important for nuclear translocation of
TPPII and stabilization of p53. Novel tripeptide-based
inhibitors of TPPII caused complete in vivo tumor regression
in mice in response to relatively low doses of ;-irradiation
(3–4 Gy/wk). This was observed with established mouse and
human tumors of diverse tissue backgrounds, with no tumor
regrowth after cancellation of treatment. These TPPII
inhibitors had minor effects on tumor growth as single agent
and had low cellular toxicity. Our data indicated that TPPII
connects signaling by cytosolic/mitochondrial and nuclear
PIKK-dependent pathways and that TPPII can be targeted for
inhibition of tumor therapy resistance. [Cancer Res 2007;
67(15):7165–74]

sensor molecules in response to stress and phosphorylate a
network of regulatory factors to initiate DNA repair and cell cycle
arrest, pathways often constitutively activated in transformed cells
(6, 7). Cells and tissues failing to express PIKKs have deficient p53
stabilization, cell cycle checkpoints, and an increased susceptibility
to apoptosis induced by g-irradiation, as present in genetic
diseases with failure to express ATM and related diseases (5, 8).
Cancer therapy frequently depends on the induction of DNA
damage (e.g., treatment with g-irradiation or DNA topoisomerase
inhibitors). Nuclear PIKKs (i.e., ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs) are
therefore also possible targets to increase the efficiency of such
therapy. Incubation of tumor cells with inhibitors of these PIKKs
blocks DNA repair responses, which increases susceptibility to
g-irradiation–induced apoptosis in vitro (9). This occurs despite
that PIKK inhibitors prevent stabilization of p53, suggesting that
apoptosis of such g-irradiated cells is p53 independent. However,
also normal tissues require PIKKs for protection against DNA
damage (4, 5, 8). Experimental in vivo studies of mice treated with
inhibitors of nuclear PIKKs have shown significant effects on
tumor growth, but tumor regression responses are usually not
observed using such protocols (10, 11). mTOR, a cytosolic PIKK
family member, has a crucial role in the integration of signals from
nutritional sensing, regulation of protein translation, and control of
Akt kinase activation (12). Inhibitors of mTOR sensitize tumors to
g-irradiation in mice, with the occasional observation of tumor
regression, and such inhibitors show promising results in trials
against some forms of cancer (12–15). In addition, inhibition of
Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, downstream targets of PIKK signaling
pathways, increases the susceptibility to tumor treatment, an effect
that may include targeting of cancer stem cells (16, 17). It is yet
unclear which PIKKs, or PIKK-dependent pathways, represent
targets for efficient cancer therapy.
Several stimuli that cause cellular stress, proteotoxic, oncogenic,
and nutrient stress, increase expression of tripeptidyl-peptidase II
(TPPII; refs. 18–21). In this article, we have explored the potential
role of TPPII in g-irradiation–induced DNA damage responses
in vitro and in resistance to g-irradiation–based cancer therapy
in vivo. TPPII is built from a unique 138-kDa subunit expressed in
multicellular organisms from Drosophila to Homo sapiens (22–24).
Data from Drosophila suggest that the TPPII complex consists of
repeated subunits forming two twisted strands with a native
structure of f6 MDa (24). TPPII degrades cytosolic polypeptides
(18–20), generates certain MHC class I ligands (25, 26), and
complements the proteasome in protein turnover. However, other
roles of TPPII may also exist, which may be unrelated to protein
turnover. TPPII regulates transduction of apoptotic signals as well as
centrosome homeostasis by unclear mechanisms (21, 27–29). We
here found that the expression of TPPII is controlled by mTOR and
that TPPII is rapidly translocated into the nucleus in response
to g-irradiation. TPPII was required for efficient stabilization

An understanding of cellular stress sensing and signal transduction at the molecular level is crucial for development of therapies
against many pathogenic conditions, including cancer, ischemia,
and viral infections (1–3). Several types of stress activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related kinases (PIKK), a family that
includes several kinases, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic
subunit (DNA-PKcs), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and
ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) in the nucleus, as well as mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) that resides in the cytosol and
mitochondria (4, 5). PIKKs play a role as signal transducers from

Cells and culture conditions. EL-4 is a benzpyrene-induced lymphoma
cell line derived from the C57BL/6 mouse strain. EL-4.wt and EL-4.TPPIIi
are EL-4 cells transfected with the pSUPER vector (30), empty versus
containing the small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against TPPII.
EL-4.TPPIIwt and EL-4.TPPIIwt/G725E are EL-4 cells transfected with
pSUPER-TPPIIi and pcDNA3-TPPIIwt versus pcDNA3-TPPIIwt/G725E (see
plasmids). HeLa cells are human cervical carcinoma cells. YAC-1 is a
Moloney leukemia virus–induced lymphoma cell line derived from the A/Sn
mouse strain. ALC is a T-cell lymphoma induced by radiation leukemia virus
D-RadLV, derived from the C57BL/6 mouse strain. For induction of stress,
cells were g-irradiated 5 to 10 Gy and incubated at 37jC and 5.3% CO2.
Enzyme inhibitors. NLVS is an inhibitor of the proteasome that
preferentially targets the chymotryptic peptidase activity and efficiently
inhibits proteasomal degradation in live cells. Ala-Ala-Phe-chloromethylketone (AAF-CMK) is a serine peptidase inhibitor that efficiently inhibits
TPPII (19), and butabindide is a specifically designed inhibitor of TPPII (30).
Z-GLA-OH is an inhibitor of subtilisin (Bachem), a bacterial enzyme with an
active site that is homologous to that of TPPII (31). Wortmannin is an
inhibitor of PIKK family kinases (Sigma), and rapamycin is a specific
inhibitor of mTOR (Cell Signaling Technology). All inhibitors were dissolved
in DMSO and stored at 20jC until use.
Plasmids and gene transfection. TPPII siRNA-expressing pSUPER (30)
plasmids were constructed as follows. Nonphosphorylated DNA oligomers
(Thermo Hybaid) were resuspended to a concentration of 3 Ag/mL. Each
oligo pair (1 AL) was mixed with 48 AL of annealing buffer [100 mmol/L
potassium acetate, 30 mmol/L HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mmol/L magnesium
acetate] and heated to 95jC for 4 min and 70jC for 10 min and then slowly
cooled to room temperature. Annealed oligomers (2 AL) were mixed with
100 ng of pSUPER plasmid (digested with BglII and HindIII), ligated, transformed, and plated on Amp/LP plates as described previously (30). Colonies
were screened for the presence of inserts by EcoRI-HindIII digestion and
DNA sequencing. Annealed oligomer pairs were as follows: pSUPER-TPPIIi,
5¶-GATCCCCGATGTATGGGAGAGGCCTTTCAAGAGAAGGCCTCTCCCATACATCTTTTTGGAAA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGATGTATGGGAGAGGCCTTCTCTTGAAAGGCCTCTCCCATACATCGGG-3¶ (reverse).
For generation of stable transfectants, 5  106 cells were washed in PBS
and then resuspended into 500 AL PBS in a Bio-Rad gene pulser and pulsed
with 10 Ag DNA and 250 V at 960 AF and selected by resistance to G418.
EL-4.TPPIIwt and EL-4.TPPIIwt/G725E are EL-4 cells transfected with
pSUPER-TPPIIi (10 Ag) and pcDNA3-TPPIIwt or pcDNA3-TPPIIwt/G725E
(1 Ag) and selected for resistance to G418 (resistance gene in pcDNA3). To
allow expression of the pcDNA3-TPPIIwt plasmids in EL-4.TPPIIi cells, we
inserted three silent mutations in the 3¶ region of TPPII among the nucleotides that interact with the pSUPER-TPPIIi–encoded siRNA (this plasmid
was denoted TPPIIwt), in addition to the mutation in position 725 (denoted
TPPIIwt/G725E).
Antibodies and antisera. The following molecules were detected by the
antibodies specified: Akt by rabbit anti-Akt serum (Cell Signaling
Technology); ATM by the mouse monoclonal 2C1 (Genetex, Inc.);
phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) by 193H2 rabbit anti–phosphorylated Akt
serum (Cell Signaling Technology); g-H2AX by rabbit anti-g-H2AX (Cell
Signaling Technology); p21 by SX118 (R&D Systems); p53 (R&D Systems);
Rae-1 by monoclonal Rat anti-mouse Rae-1, 199215 (R&D Systems); and
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) by monoclonal mouse anti-

human XIAP, 117320 (R&D Systems). For detection of TPPII, we used
chicken anti-TPPII serum (Immunsystem). Western blotting was done by
standard techniques. Protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic
acid protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). Protein (5 Ag) was loaded
per lane for separation by SDS-PAGE unless stated otherwise.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were attached to glass coverslips through
cytospin and fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1) for 1 h; then, the slides were
rehydrated in balanced salt solution (BSS) buffer for 1 h. The first antibody was
added and remained for 1 h until a brief wash in BSS, after which a secondary
conjugate (anti-rabbit FITC) was added and incubated for 1 h. Then, the slides
were washed and stained with Hoechst 333258 for 30 min. Finally, the slides
were mounted with DABCO mounting buffer and kept at 4jC until analysis.
Flow cytometry. For staining of cell surface Rae-1 antigens, we
incubated 0.5  106 to 1.0  106 cells with 50 AL of Rae-1 monoclonal
antibody 199215 at 20 Ag/mL and incubated on ice for 30 min. After
washing in PBS, we sequentially incubated with biotinylated polyclonal
rabbit anti-rat Ig (DakoCytomation) and streptavidin-FITC (PharMingen),
with washing in PBS after each step. Fluorescence was quantified by a
FACSCalibur. Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide staining.
Enzyme purification and peptidase assay. Cells (100  106) were
sedimented and lysed by vortexing in glass beads and 500 to 1,000 AL of
homogenization buffer [50 mmol/L Tris base (pH 7.5), 250 mmol/L sucrose,
5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT]. Cellular fractions generated by
differential centrifugation were as follows: nuclear fraction (pellet of
14,000  rpm, 15 min), microsomal fraction (pellet of 100,000  g
centrifugation of supernatant from nuclear fraction, 1 h), and high
molecular weight cytosolic fraction (pellet of 100,000  g centrifugation
of supernatant of microsomal fraction, 3 to 5 h). The resulting high
molecular weight pellet was dissolved in 50 mmol/L Tris base (pH 7.5),
30% glycerol, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1 mmol/L DTT, and 1 Ag of high
molecular weight protein was used as enzyme in peptidase assays or in
Western blotting for TPPII expression. To test the activity of TPPII, we used
the substrate Ala-Ala-Phe-aminomethylcoumarin (AAF-AMC; Sigma) at
100 Amol/L concentration in 100 AL of test buffer composed of 50 mmol/L
Tris base (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1 mmol/L DTT. Inhibitors were
preincubated with the enzyme for 1 h at 37jC before adding the substrate.
Cleavage activity was measured by emission at 460 nm in a LS50B
luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer).
Tumor growth experiments. Tumor cells were washed in PBS and
resuspended in a volume of 200 AL/inoculate. The cells were then
inoculated into the right flank at 106 per syngeneic C57BL/6 mouse, and
growth of the tumor was monitored by measurement twice weekly. The
initiation of antitumor treatment of the mice was to some extent
individualized according to when tumor growth started in each mouse.
The mice were irradiated with 4 Gy before tumor inoculation to inhibit
antitumor immune responses. The tumor volume was calculated as the
mean volume in mice with tumor growth according to (a 1  a 2  a 3) / 2
(the numbers a 1, a 2, and a 3 denote tumor diameter, width, and depth,
respectively). The time of first palpation varied between different mice,
although the general pattern of growth was similar in virtually all of the
mice. In most diagrams, a log scale is used to better visualize the
therapeutic effects against small tumors (i.e., the presence of complete
rejections). For inhibition of TPPII in vivo, we made i.p. injections with
13.8 mg/kg body weight (14 AL of a 50 mmol/L solution/mouse) of the
subtilisin inhibitor Z-GLA-OH twice weekly, diluted into 200 AL PBS. All
g-irradiations were full body exposures.

of p53 and for efficient cell cycle arrest at low g-irradiation doses
(2–4 Gy). Akt activation and resistance to low serum concentrations
was also impaired in cells with inhibited TPPII expression. We
observed a dramatic in vivo radiosensitization of mouse and human
tumors by the tripeptide-based TPPII inhibitor [Z-Gly-Leu-Ala-OH
(Z-GLA-OH)], with complete regression in response to repeated 3 to
4 Gy doses of g-irradiation. We found that TPPII has an essential role
in responses to g-irradiation and that this peptidase can be targeted
for treatment of tumors.

Results
Cell cycle arrest at low doses of ;-irradiation depends on
TPPII. TPPII expression is increased by several stimuli that result
in cellular stress, but which signals that cause this increase is not
clear (18–21). We therefore tested whether this increase was
controlled by PIKKs and whether mTOR was involved. To trigger a
cellular stress response where members of the PIKK family
members control signal transduction, we used g-irradiation. By

Western blotting analysis of cellular lysates from the T-cell
lymphoma line EL-4 with chicken anti-TPPII serum, we found
that TPPII expression was increased by g-irradiation, as found with
other types of stress (18–21). Further, this increase was not present
in g-irradiated EL-4 cells treated with 1 Amol/L wortmannin (PIKK
inhibitor) or 100 nmol/L rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) that instead
reduced TPPII expression (Fig. 1A). Treatment with NLVS, a
proteasomal inhibitor, reduced down-regulation of TPPII in
wortmannin-treated g-irradiated EL-4 cells, suggesting that TPPII
is degraded at least in part by the proteasome in the absence of
PIKK signaling (Fig. 1A). Increased levels of TPPII were previously
found in EL-4 cells growing in the presence of inhibited
proteasomal activity (18–20).
To further study whether TPPII had any role in cellular responses
mediated by PIKKs, we generated stable EL-4 transfectants
expressing siRNA directed against TPPII, encoded by the pSUPER
vector (denoted EL-4.TPPIII; ref. 30). EL-4.TPPIIi cells had both
inhibited expression and activity of TPPII in comparison with EL4.wt cells (transfected with empty pSUPER vector; Supplementary
Data I). We first analyzed the subcellular distribution of TPPII in
untreated versus g-irradiated EL-4 cells using EL-4.TPPIIi cells as
specificity control of the immunocytochemical staining with
chicken anti-TPPII serum. TPPII was reported as a soluble cytosolic
peptidase (22, 25), but we here found rapid translocation of TPPII
into the nucleus of most g-irradiated EL-4 cells (Fig. 1B). This was
evident already 1 h following g-irradiation 5 Gy exposure of EL-4
cells as detected by immunocytochemical analysis of TPPII, and
this translocation was inhibited by treatment with 100 nmol/L

rapamycin (Fig. 1B). A similar translocation was observed in ALC
and YAC-1 lymphoma as well as Lewis lung carcinoma (LCC) cells.3
Activation of PIKKs is required to halt cellular proliferation in
response to DNA damage (4, 5). We observed that proliferation of
EL-4.wt cells was halted after exposure to 2 to 4 Gy of g-irradiation,
but this response was much weaker in EL-4.TPPIIi cells that
continued proliferation (Fig. 1C). Proliferation of both EL-4.TPPIIi
and EL-4.wt cells was blocked in response to higher doses of
g-irradiation (10 Gy; Fig. 1C). Further, EL-4.wt control cells showed
both G1 and G2-M arrest, whereas EL-4.TPPIIi cells failed to arrest
in G1 but accumulated in G2-M after exposure to 10 Gy of
g-irradiation. It is presently not clear if this reflects the presence
of an active G2-M checkpoint mechanism in EL-4.TPPIIi or mitotic
failure (Fig. 1D). In addition, EL-4.TPPIIi cells displayed a reduced
sub-G1 peak compared with EL-4.wt cells, suggesting a reduced
level of acute EL-4.TPPIIi cell death in response to g-irradiation
(Fig. 1D). Initial detection of DNA damage was still present in
g-irradiated EL-4.TPPIIi cells as measured by immunocytochemical
detection of g-H2AX (Ser139-phosphorylated H2AX; Supplementary
Data II). H2AX is phosphorylated in response to ATM activation,
which triggers the formation of DNA repair foci (4). Thus, TPPII
expression depends on mTOR and was required to efficiently halt
proliferation of EL-4 cells in response to g-irradiation but not for
detection of DNA damage.

TPPII is required for a physical link between p53 and ATM
following g-irradiation.
A BRCA COOH-terminal–like motif of TPPII required for
efficient p53 stabilization in response to ;-irradiation. BRCA
COOH-terminal (BRCT) repeat domains are often contained within
proteins controlling DNA damage signaling pathways, where they
control interactions with ATM substrates (34–36). We found one
region of TPPII centered around the GG doublet at position 725,
which matched most, but not all, requirements of a BRCT motif
(Fig. 3A; ref. 34). We did site-directed mutagenesis of the
characteristic Gly-Gly doublet present in many BRCT sequences
(Fig. 3A, asterisk), mutating it into Gly-Glu in our pcDNA3-TPPII
vector. To allow expression of this plasmid in EL-4.TPPIIi cells, we
inserted three silent mutations in the 3¶ region of TPPII among the
nucleotides that interact with the pSUPER-TPPIII–encoded siRNA
(this plasmid was denoted TPPIIwt), in addition to the mutation in
position 725 (denoted TPPIIwt/G725E). We found that both TPPIIwt
as well as TPPIIwt/G725E mutant molecules were stably expressed in
EL-4 cells cotransfected with pSUPER-TPPIIi, with TPPII expression
levels similar to those observed in EL-4.wt control cells (Fig. 3B). The
expression of p53 was analyzed in EL-4.wt, EL-4.TPPIIwt, and
EL-4.TPPIIwt/G725E transfectant cells exposed to g-irradiation.
EL-4.TPPIIwt/G725E cells showed minor expression of p53 compared
with EL-4.TPPIIwt and EL-4.wt control cells, further supporting the
role for TPPII in g-irradiation–induced p53 stabilization (Fig. 3C).
The G725E mutation had no significant effects on the serine
peptidase activity of TPPII as measured by fluorimetric substrate
cleavage by partially purified TPPII enzyme (Supplementary Data V).
The subcellular localization of TPPII was examined in EL-4.TPPIIwt
and EL-4.TPPIIwt/G725E cells by immunocytochemical analysis
before and after g-irradiation. EL-4.TPPIIwt cells showed a
predominantly cytosolic staining, with a subsequent relocalization
into the nucleus following g-irradiation (Fig. 3D). However, this failed
to occur in EL-4.TPPIIwt/G725E cells, where TPPII instead remained
mainly cytosolic following exposure to 5 Gy of g-irradiation (Fig. 3D).
These data indicated that a nuclear localization of TPPII was
important for g-irradiation–induced p53 stabilization and that this
depended on a BRCT-like domain of TPPII.
TPPII controls cellular requirements for growth factors
during proliferation in vitro. Because the expression of TPPII
was controlled by mTOR, we examined whether EL-4.wt versus

Failure to stabilize p53 in cells with inhibited TPPII
expression. The transcription factor p53 initiates cell cycle arrest
in response to many types of stress, and its expression is
controlled through direct phosphorylation by PIKKs; also, mTOR
may have a role in this process (12, 15). By Western blotting
analysis in cellular lysates of g-irradiated EL-4.wt cells, we found
increased levels of p53, whereas those of EL-4.TPPIIi cells showed
low levels (Fig. 2A). However, treatment with NLVS increased p53
expression of g-irradiated EL-4.TPPIIi cells, suggesting that p53
was still synthesized but degraded by the proteasome in EL4.TPPIIi cells (Fig. 2A). We designed three additional pSUPERexpressed siRNAs, of which two inhibited p53 stabilization,
following g-irradiation of transiently transfected EL-4 cells
(Supplementary Data III). p21, a transcriptional target of p53,
was very weakly expressed in EL-4.TPPIIi cells following exposure
to g-irradiation compared with EL-4.wt control cells (Fig. 2B).
Further, EL-4.pcDNA3-TPPII cells that stably overexpress TPPII
showed increased levels of p53 following exposure to g-irradiation
in comparison with EL-4.pcDNA3 cells (Fig. 2C; ref. 32). In
addition, treatment of EL-4.pcDNA3-TPPII cells with the specific
TPPII inhibitor butabindide caused substantially reduced p53
expression (Fig. 2C; ref. 33). We found that p53 expression was
also TPPII dependent in g-irradiated YAC-1 and ALC lymphoma
cells, where virtually no p53 was detectable following stable
expression of pSUPER-TPPIIi (Supplementary Data IV). We failed
to find expression of p53 in LLC cells, also supporting that nuclear
translocation of TPPII did not require p53 (Supplementary Data
IV).3 We noted substantial levels of p53 in some of our control
tumor cell lines also before exposure to g-irradiation (e.g., YAC-1
and ALC), a phenomenon in line with the frequent presence of a
constitutive DNA damage response in transformed cells (6, 7). To
test if p53 and TPPII were physically linked, we next did
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-serum directed
against the NH2 terminus of p53 followed by Western blot analysis
for TPPII. In p53 immunoprecipitates from lysates of EL-4.wt
cells, we detected TPPII, levels that were much increased by
g-irradiation (Fig. 2D, at 8 h). We also detected ATM in p53
immunoprecipitates from EL-4.wt, but not from EL-4.TPPIIi cells,
as measured by Western blotting (Fig. 2D). Further, NLVS-treated
EL-4.TPPIIi cells, which accumulated p53, also failed to show ATM
in p53 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that

ref. 21). Activation of PIKKs also mediates expression of cell surface
NKG2D ligands (41). By flow cytometric measurements, we detected
expression of Rae-1 (belonging to a mouse family of NKG2D ligands)
on EL-4.wt and YAC-1 cells, whereas ALC failed to express Rae-1
ligands. In contrast, EL-4.TPPIIi and YAC-1.TPPIIi cells expressed
minor amounts of Rae-1 (Supplementary Data VII). Overall, these
data suggest the requirement for TPPII in several stress-induced
pathways that respond to g-irradiation or changes in nutrition.
TPPII expression controls ;-irradiation resistance of EL-4
tumors in vivo. PIKKs, including ATM, DNA-PKcs, and mTOR, as
well as their targets Chk1 and Chk2, are possible target molecules
for novel cancer therapies (16, 17, 42). To address whether TPPIImediated growth regulation was important for in vivo tumor
growth, we inoculated 106 EL-4.wt control or EL-4.TPPIIi cells into
syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. We found that EL-4.wt and EL-4.TPPIIi
cells grew at an approximately equal rate, suggesting that TPPII
was not important for growth of EL-4 tumors in vivo (Fig. 5A and
B, Control). However, we also treated mice carrying either tumors
of EL-4.wt or EL-4.TPPIIi cells with 2 to 4 doses of 4 Gy (400 Rads)
g-irradiation. We found that this had minor effects on the size
of tumors of EL-4.wt cells that continued to grow despite
g-irradiation (Fig. 5A, g-irradiation indicated with arrow). In
contrast, mice carrying tumors of EL-4.TPPIIi cells responded to
g-irradiation treatment with complete regression of established
tumors (Fig. 5B). These data resembled those obtained with tumors
of EL-4.ATMi or EL-4.TPPIIwt/G725E cells because these also failed
to resist g-irradiation in vivo, whereas control tumors resisted
g-irradiation doses of 3 to 4 Gy (Fig. 5C). EL-4.ATMi are EL-4 cells
with inhibited ATM expression due to a stable expression of an
ATM-directed pSUPER plasmid (Supplementary Data VIII). These
data may suggest TPPII as a possible target to increase in vivo
g-irradiation susceptibility of tumor cells in vivo.

EL-4.TPPIIi cells responded differently to changes in nutrition.
mTOR-Rictor complexes control Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt
kinase, an important step for Akt activation and for transduction of
certain growth factor signals (although other PIKKs are also
claimed for this role; ref. 37–39). We detected substantial levels of
phosphorylated Ser473 Akt in lysates of EL-4.wt cells. However,
EL-4.TPPIIi cells displayed very low levels of phosphorylated Ser473
Akt, whereas the total expression of Akt protein was similar to EL4.wt cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, we find increased Ser473
phosphorylation of Akt in EL-4.pcDNA3-TPPII, in comparison with
EL-4.pcDNA3 control cells, further supporting that TPPII expression correlates with Akt Ser473 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). These
data were in line with the serum requirements during in vitro cell
growth of EL-4.wt versus EL-4.TPPIIi cells. In normal medium (5%
serum), EL-4.TPPIIi cells showed an increased rate of proliferation,
compared with EL-4.wt, but also an increased accumulation of
dead cells (Fig. 4B). By lowering serum concentrations to 1%, this
accumulation was accelerated compared with EL-4.wt cells
(Fig. 4B). Further, TPPII was strongly induced in EL-4.wt on days
5 to 7 ( following seeding of cells at 100,000/mL), and replenishment of medium down-regulated TPPII expression (Fig. 4C, arrow).
In addition, EL-4.pcDNA3-TPPII cells were able to do limited
growth in 0.5% serum, which EL-4.pcDNA3 cells did not (Fig. 4D).
These results indicated that TPPII expression was important for
Akt Ser473 phosphorylation and cell survival during in vitro culture.
We previously reported that up-regulation of TPPII causes
increased expression of c-IAP-1 and XIAP molecules (endogenous
caspase inhibitors) in EL-4.pcDNA3-TPPII cells (21), and XIAP
stability is controlled by Akt (40). By treatment with etoposide, we
found that expression of XIAP was substantially higher in EL-4.wt
cells compared with EL-4.TPPIIi cells, with a slower rate of
degradation, in line with previous studies (Supplementary Data VI;

by 100 Amol/L AAF-CMK are unlikely due to TPPII inhibition
because other TPPII inhibitors fail to mediate these effects. We
concluded that Z-GLA-OH inhibits TPPII and has low toxicity to
several tumor cell lines in vitro.
To test the effects of catalytic TPPII inhibition during tumor
g-irradiation in vivo, we exposed C57BL/6 mice with established
EL-4 tumors to g-irradiation doses of 4 Gy (one dose per week) and
injections with Z-GLA-OH twice weekly (13.8 mg/kg body weight).
As observed previously, weekly g-irradiation doses of 4 Gy had
minor effects on growth of established EL-4 tumors in C57BL/6
control mice. In contrast, following injection with Z-GLA-OH, we
observed complete tumor regression after three to four doses of
4 Gy g-irradiation in all mice tested (in total >50 mice, one
representative experiment 7–8 mice/group in Fig. 6B). When these
tumors were no longer palpable, the treatment was canceled, and
no regrowth of tumors was observed for the entire period of
observation (over 3 months). These therapeutic effects showed a
dose-dependent response both for g-irradiation and amounts of
Z-GLA-OH, with complete tumor rejections observed also in some
mice treated with reduced doses (Supplementary Data X).
One common reason behind tumor therapy resistance, including
in vivo resistance to g-irradiation, is p53 mutations (45). To test
whether also p53-mutated tumors responded to g-irradiation in the
presence of TPPII inhibitors, we similarly inoculated 106 LLC cells
in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice (see p53 expression in Supplementary
Data IV). We found that LLC tumors were virtually insensitive to
repeated g-irradiation doses of 4 Gy, and Z-GLA-OH only (in
the absence of g-irradiation) gave no effect (Fig. 6C). In contrast,
we observed complete regression of established LLC tumors to
g-irradiation in mice injected with Z-GLA-OH (Fig. 6C). We found
that the protected dipeptide analogue Z-GL-OH was ineffective
both in terms of TPPII inhibition and radiosensitization of LLC

Tripeptide-based TPPII inhibitors radiosensitize tumors
in vivo. To invent an experimental therapy from these findings, a
low molecular weight compound may be required, but it is unclear
whether a catalytic TPPII inhibitor causes effects resembling those
of siRNA. Further, several of the available catalytic inhibitors of
TPPII, such as butabindide and AAF-CMK (a serine peptidase
inhibitor that efficiently inhibits TPPII), are unsuitable for use
in vivo due to insufficient stability and specificity of these
compounds. TPPII is a subtilisin-type serine peptidase, with a
catalytic domain that is homologous to bacterial subtilisins (31).
We found that the tripeptide subtilisin inhibitor Z-GLA-OH
efficiently inhibited TPPII, slightly less efficient than observed for
butabindide (which has a Ki50 of 7 nmol/L; ref. 33), as observed
by inhibited TPPII cleavage of the substrate AAF-AMC (Fig. 6A).
Moreover, Z-GLA-OH was relatively stable in serum compared with
both AAF-CMK and butabindide.3
We next examined the toxicity of Z-GLA-OH to cell lines in vitro
and compared with AAF-CMK. TPPII inhibitors down-regulate the
activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and inhibit growth of
certain tumor cells in vitro (18, 20, 43). We therefore compared
inhibitors of TPPII for their ability to accumulate an unstable green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-based proteasomal reporter substrate by
treatment of EL-4.Ub-R-GFP cells (44). We found that AAF-CMK
inhibited the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as indicated by R-GFP
accumulation in EL-4.Ub-R-GFP cells measured by flow cytometry
(44). However, neither Z-GLA-OH nor butabindide did so (even
at 100 Amol/L to 1 mmol/L; Fig. 6A). Further, Z-GLA-OH failed
to inhibit growth of two different Burkitt lymphoma lines, in
contrast to AAF-CMK that showed substantial toxic effects
(Supplementary Data IX). This discrepancy may in part be due to
the particular choice of cell line for these in vitro assays, but the
acute toxicity and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway inhibition caused

tumors (Fig. 6A and C). Further, butabindide was also an ineffective
in vivo as a radiosensitizer of LLC tumors, in line with its poor
stability in serum (25). TPPII is an evolutionary conserved enzyme
with an identity of 96% at the amino acid level between human
and mouse, and we observed strong tumor regression also of
human HeLa cervical carcinoma cells in Z-GLA-OH–treated severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice in response to girradiation (Fig. 6D). A reduced dose of g-irradiation (1.5 Gy/dose)
was used because SCID mice have substantially reduced radioresistance. From these results, we concluded that a low molecular
weight compound designed to inhibit a bacterial enzyme has
antitumor effects in vivo in mice, most likely through an inhibitory
effect against its mammalian homologue, TPPII.
Toxicity studies show that Z-GLA-OH had minor effects in vivo
as single agent in doses up to 100 mg/kg in a preliminary study.4
Toxicity to normal tissues of Z-GLA-OH in the presence of
g-irradiation has not formally been tested, but our mice survived
for an extended period of time after the study. Because the
g-irradiation protocols used here were exclusively whole body
exposures, all tissues where Z-GLA-OH was distributed were

exposed to g-irradiation and Z-GLA-OH in combination. This may
suggest manageable toxicity also for the combined treatment.

Discussion
This article describes an essential role for TPPII in cellular
responses to g-irradiation. The observations of complete in vivo
tumor regression in mice injected with peptide-based TPPII
inhibitors, in response to relatively low doses of g-irradiation,
suggest that our findings have therapeutic potential. Our data
indicated that mTOR activity was required for translocation of a
large proportion of cytosolic TPPII into the nucleus of g-irradiated
cells. TPPII controlled a g-irradiation–induced physical link
between ATM and p53 and may thereby have a role, direct or
indirect, in the recruitment of regulatory factors to PIKKs, a role
that is unclear at this moment. ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs have a
certain degree of redundancy in stabilization of p53, with multiple
NH2-terminal sites for p53 phosphorylation and with more than
one PIKK targeting the same site (46). A failure of regulatory factor
recruitment (e.g., to DNA repair foci) may deny p53 activation by
several PIKKs, which would explain the strong reduction of p53
stabilization that we observe in pSUPER-TPPIII–expressing cells.
Our in vivo data may support a model were g-irradiation exposure
in the absence of TPPII expression in vivo leads to a failure to
respond to stress, resulting in an irreversible state of tumor

damage. Radiosensitization by in vivo targeting of the DNA damage
response in g-irradiated tumor cells makes sense from a cell
biological perspective, but the high efficiency of TPPII targeting in
this experimental tumor therapy was unexpected. A large number
of established and experimental cancer therapies inhibit the
growth of tumors in mice (e.g., inhibitors of PIKKs and Chk
proteins; refs. 10–17). However, reported data fail to support that

increased acute toxicity in response to g-irradiation in vitro, which
was not observed here with EL-4.TPPIIi cells (see Fig. 1D). In
addition to direct damage on the tumor g-irradiation also has an
antiangiogenic effect, mTOR signaling is required for protection
of tumor vasculature exposed to g-irradiation (47). However, tumor

controlled by PIKKs because several PIKKs as well as their
substrates localize to centrosomes during mitosis (49).
The degree of homology between the NH2-terminal catalytic
domain of TPPII and subtilisin of Bacillus subtilis (381 amino acids)
is 25% to 30%, including a conserved pentapeptide encompassing
the catalytically active Ser449 of TPPII (Asn-Gly-Thr-Ser-Met; ref.
31). Bacterial subtilisins are thoroughly studied enzymes, with
numerous reports on crystal structure and enzymatic function,
which may further assist development of TPPII inhibitors (50).
TPPII may potentially be a useful molecular target during the acute
phases of ischemia, or HIV infections, because pathogenesis of
these diseases depends on signaling by PIKKs (2, 3). Future clinical
testing of these tripeptide-based TPPII inhibitors may give further
information about whether they are useful for therapy in patients.

regression following treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors
regularly results in tumor relapses after termination of treatment
(48). Still it will be important to determine if TPPII has a role in
mTOR-Raptor or mTOR-Rictor signaling. The exact mechanism for
in vivo tumor protection of this TPPII-dependent stress response
pathway remains to be explained.
Previous observations have shown that TPPII activity is upregulated in several lymphoma cell lines with low proteasomal
activity during cellular adaption to growth in the presence of
proteasomal inhibitors and overexpression of c-myc. This was
associated with a TPPII-mediated compensation for insufficient
proteasomal substrate degradation (18–20). In view of the present
data, increased TPPII activity may have been a general response to
stress, including activation of PIKKs. TPPII was also studied in
relation to centrosomal duplication errors during mitosis, where it
was reported that butabindide inhibited such events in vitro (43).
TPPII inhibitors were proposed as agents to suppress mitotic
infidelity in tumors (28, 29, 43). Lymphoma cells with constitutively
overexpressed TPPII have overexpression of IAP family proteins,
whereby errors during mitosis may have resulted from inhibition of
apoptosis at the mitotic checkpoint (21, 29). These deregulations
may also be caused by altered signal transduction in pathways

Retraction

Retraction: Tripeptidyl-Peptidase II Controls
DNA Damage Responses and In Vivo
g-Irradiation Resistance of Tumors
The authors retract the article titled "Tripeptidyl-Peptidase II Controls DNA Damage
Responses and In Vivo g-Irradiation Resistance of Tumors," which was published in
the August 1, 2007, issue of Cancer Research (1).
The authors have been unable to reproduce the in vivo data of this article and the data
concerning the requirement for PI3K-like kinases in the relocalization of TPPII in
response to g-irradiation. Analysis of other data of this article could be continued by
new experiments using modified protocols. They are presented elsewhere (2). The
authors apologize for the confusion caused by the published data. Five of the 7 authors
agreed to the retraction of this article; one author (Lu Lei) was unable to be located,
and another author (Hong Xu) disagreed with the retraction of the article.
