ABSTRACT:
Although there is a relationship between DNA repair deficiency and temozolomide
(TMZ) resistance in glioblastoma (GBM), it remains unclear which molecule is
associated with GBM recurrence. We isolated three TMZ-resistant human GBM cell
lines and examined the expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) and mismatch repair (MMR) components. We used immunohistochemical
analysis to compare MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), postmeiotic segregation increased 2
(PMS2) and MGMT expression in primary and recurrent GBM specimens obtained from
GBM patients during TMZ treatment. We found a reduction in MLH1 expression and
a subsequent reduction in PMS2 protein levels in TMZ-resistant cells. Furthermore,
MLH1 or PMS2 knockdown confered TMZ resistance. In recurrent GBM tumours, the
expression of MLH1 and PMS2 was reduced when compared to primary tumours.

INTRODUCTION

homolog 6; MSH6; ENSG00000116062 / mutS homolog

homolog 1; MLH1; ENSG00000076242 / postmeiotic
segregation increased 2; PMS2; ENSG00000122512).
MutS-alpha initially recognizes DNA mismatches, while
MutL-alpha identifies the mismatch and subsequently
excises the nascent error containing DNA strand [4].
Previous studies have suggested that there is a relationship
between deficiencies in these four MMR components and
GBM recurrence [5-7]; however it remains unclear which
MMR components are most important in influencing the
acquisition of TMZ resistance.
Therefore, we established TMZ-resistant cell lines
that do not express MGMT from U251 human GBM
cells and analysed their TMZ resistance. In addition, we
analysed the expression of MLH1, PMS2 and MGMT in
primary and recurrent GBM tumour samples obtained
from patients with GBM recurrence during TMZ
treatment.

Treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide
(TMZ) has resulted in benefits for patients with
glioblastoma (GBM). Nevertheless, almost all GBMs
recur and lead to death of the patients [1-3]. Intrinsic
or acquired resistance to TMZ, is one of the greatest
obstacles in successful GBM treatment, and is thought to
be influenced by a variety of mechanisms.
Studies indicate that DNA repair molecule
deficiency is linked to the acquisition of TMZ resistance in
GBM; however clarification on which molecules are most
important in the attainment of TMZ resistance is required.
For instance, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) (ENSG00000170430), which is the best-known
cause of TMZ resistance, is only expressed at low levels
in many GBMs due to the methylation of its promoter
region. Mismatch repair (MMR)-dependent correction
of replication errors and responses to DNA damage
requires heterodimeric complexes of MutS-alpha (mutS

RESULTS

G2/M arrest and apoptosis is induced by TMZ in
U251 cells but not in U251/TMZR2 cells.

Generation and analysis of TMZ-resistant cell
lines.

Next, the cell cycle populations of U251 and
U251/TMZR2 were analysed to determine whether the
decreased sensitivity of the U251/TMZR2 cells to TMZ
resulted in a reduction of cell cycle arrest and cell death.
After treatment with 800 micro-M TMZ for 120 h, U251
cells were mostly arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle, and there was an increase in the sub-G1 fraction of
cells when compared to the control cells. In contrast, TMZ
treatment did not alter the cell cycle distribution, or the
sub-G1 fraction of U251/TMZR2 cells when compared
to control cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). We then
measured caspase-3 activity in U251 and U251/TMZR2
cells after treatment with 800 micro M TMZ for 96 h.
Our results showed that caspase-3 activity in U251 cells
was 5.9 ± 0.6-fold higher than in U251/TMZR2 cells
(p < 0.01) (Supplementary Figure S2B). These results
demonstrate that TMZ induces MMR mediated G2/M
arrest and apoptosis in parental cells, whereas acquired
resistance to TMZ protects cells from TMZ-induced G2/M
arrest and apoptosis.

To analyse cellular TMZ resistance mechanisms, we
generated TMZ-resistant U251 cell lines (U251/TMZR1,
U251/TMZR2 and U251/TMZR3 cells). MTT assays
showed that these cells displayed a resistance to TMZ
that was increased by 6.7-fold, 12.9-fold and 8.4-fold,
respectively, when compared with that of U251 cells. In
addition, the TMZ-resistant cells showed cross-resistance
to a SN1-type methylating agent, N-Methyl-N ʹ -nitro-Nnitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which has properties similar to
those of TMZ. The cells did not show obvious resistance
to other types of methylating agents such as nimustine
(ACNU), which is a SN2-type methylating agent, or
methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), which, unlike TMZ,
does not add methyl groups to the O6 position of guanine
nucleotides (Table 1).

MGMT is not involved in the acquisition of
resistance to TMZ.

Reduction of MLH1 expression and subsequent
reduction in PMS2 protein expression is involved
in TMZ resistance.

An increase in cellular MGMT activity is the bestknown mechanism by which cells acquire TMZ resistance
[8, 9]. However, neither MGMT mRNA nor MGMT
protein were detectable in the TMZ-resistant cells or the
U251 cells (Supplementary Figure S1A, B). The MGMT
promoter region has been reported to be methylated and,
thereby, inactivated in U251 cells. Therefore, we examined
the status of the promoter region of the MGMT gene in
U251 and the TMZ-resistant cells by using methylationspecific PCR. This analysis indicated that the promoter
region of the MGMT gene in U251 and TMZ-resistant
cells was methylated (Supplementary Figure S1C).

DNA alkylating agents such as MNNG and TMZ
have been reported to induce MMR, DNA damageinduced G2 checkpoint, and apoptosis [10-14]. To
determine whether MMR systems were altered in the
TMZ-resistant cells, we compared the expression of the
MMR proteins MSH6, MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2 in U251
cells and TMZ-resistant cells. We found that the mRNA
and protein expression of MLH1 was consistently lower
in the TMZ-resistant cells than in the U251 cells (Fig.
1A, B). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of MLH1
was significantly induced by TMZ in a time dependent
manner in U251 cells, whereas only slight TMZ-mediated

Diminished MLH1 expression reduces the

in PMS2 protein stability, and attenuation of MLH1 and
PMS2 confers TMZ resistance to GBM cells.

The expression of MLH1 and PMS2 is reduced
in recurrent human glioblastomas during
administration of TMZ.

To confirm whether the reduction of MLH1
expression attenuates PMS2 protein and confers TMZ
resistance, we tested several GBM cells using MLH1
siRNA knockdown. MLH1-specific siRNA significantly
reduced not only the mRNA and protein expression of
MLH1 in GBM cells, but also the expression of PMS2
protein (Fig. 2A, B). Notably, knockdown of MLH1 did
not affect the expression of PMS2 mRNA (Fig. 2A). In
contrast, knockdown of PMS2 by siRNA did not affect
the mRNA expression of MLH1, but slightly affected the
protein expression of MLH1 (Fig. 2A, C). In addition,
MLH1 or PMS2-specific siRNA-treated GBM cells were
resistant to TMZ when compared to control siRNA-treated
cells (Table 2). These data indicate that MLH1 is involved

If the reduction of MLH1 and/or PMS2 expression
plays an important role in the acquisition of TMZ
resistance in vivo as well as in vitro, MLH1 and/or PMS2
attenuation might be involved in the recurrence of GBMs.
We therefore evaluated MLH1 and PMS2 expression
in a total of 11 clinical GBM and AA specimens using
immunohistochemical methods. Immunohistochemical
analysis of initial and recurrent tumours of a representative
case that was treated with TMZ is shown in Fig. 3A,

that its expression in initial lesions was an indicator of
reduced patient survival [6]. On the other hand, Flesberg
et al. showed that the expression of MSH6, MSH2, and
PMS2 were reduced in recurrent GBM, but that MLH1
expression was not correlated to recurrence [7]. However,
in the Felsberg study, 32.6 % of the recurrent tumours
showed lower levels of MLH1 expression than in the
primary tumours. This could mean that a decrease in
MutL alpha may occur. We revealed that the suppression
of MLH1 expression decreases the expression of PMS2
protein in TMZ-resistant cells and GBM cell lines in
vitro. However, in our clinical data, though the expression
of MLH1 and PMS2 decreases, the alternation of the
expression of these genes did not always correlate each
other (Fig. 3B). In addition, the protein expression
of MSH6 was also decreased in U251/TMZR1 cells
(Fig. 1B). These facts suggest that a decrease in MLH1
expression occurs early during the acquisition of TMZ
resistance and, accordingly, the expression of PMS2
protein is reduced, although other factors may influence
the expression of MMR component. However, the
mechanism by which this occurs remains to be elucidated.
There is some new knowledge about the mechanism
of chemoresistance in GBM. Urszula et al. revealed that
loss of PDCD4 contributes to enhanced chemoresistance
in GBM [21]. Swapna et al. revealed that epigenetic
regulation of miRNA-211 by MMP-9 give the insensitivity
of GBM to radiation and TMZ [22]. It might necessary
to examine the function of such molecules in our TMZresistant cells. In addition, some studies propose new
drugs for GBM treatment [23, 24]. Some clues to
overcome TMZ resistance might be revealed by examine
the effect of such new drugs against our TMZ-resistance
cells.
In summary, we have shown that U251 GBM
cells acquire resistance to TMZ by reducing MLH1
expression following destabilization of PMS2 protein
that is attenuated by MutL alpha. In addition, a significant
reduction in MLH1 and PMS2 expression was observed in
recurrent GBM tumours during TMZ administration. Our
data suggest that a reduction in MLH1 protein expression
leads to PMS2 protein instability, which confers TMZ
resistance on GBM cells. This could lead to the recurrence
of GBM during the course of TMZ treatment. Evaluating
the expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in GBM may therefore
provide a useful index for predicting the efficiency of
TMZ anti-tumour activity.

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have suggested that MGMT and
base excision repair (BER) are involved in TMZ resistance
[15, 16]. MGMT also repairs the O6-chloroethylguanine
residues induced by SN2-type methylating agents such as
ACNU [17, 18]. Additionally, BER is involved in MMS
resistance [19]. However, our TMZ-resistant cells did not
show cross-resistance to such methylating agents (Table1).
In addition, the MGMT promoter was methylated in both
the TMZ-resistant cells as well as the parental U251 cells
(Supplementary Figure S1C). These results suggest that
MGMT and BER are not involved in the acquisition of
TMZ resistance. Furthermore, in clinical samples, we
could not find any correlation between MGMT expression
and tumour recurrence (Supplementary Figure S3A, B).
Previous studies have indicated a relationship
between deficiencies in MMR components (MSH6,
MSH2, MLH1, PMS2) and GBM recurrence [5-7];
however it remains unclear which component is most
relevant for the acquisition of TMZ resistance. A decrease
in MLH1 expression was observed in all three independent
TMZ-resistant cell lines, and attenuation of MLH1
expression consistently modulated TMZ sensitivity in
several GBM cell lines (Fig. 1A, B; Table 2). Furthermore,
PMS2 protein expression was reduced in these TMZresistant cells and was correlated to that of MLH1 (Fig.
1A, B).
We clearly demonstrated that MLH1 or PMS2
knockdown confers TMZ resistance to GBM cells.
Interestingly, the protein expression of PMS2 was not
correlated with its mRNA expression levels. MLH1
knockdown by siRNA decreased PMS2 protein
expression and not PMS2 mRNA expression. Moreover,
the expression of PMS2 protein was associated with
that of MLH1 protein in several GBM cell lines (Fig.
2A, B). However, the protein expression of MSH2 and
beta-catenin was not affected by attenuation of MLH1
expression (Fig. 1D). This would suggest that MLH1
protein expression specifically affects the stability of the
PMS2 protein. In contrast, PMS2 knockdown slightly
affected the protein expression of MLH1 (Fig. 2C).
Previously, Mohd et al. showed that PMS2 was stabilized
in the presence of MLH1 through heterodimer formation
by using an overexpression system [20]. We obtained
consistent results indicating that MLH1 expression is
responsible for the stability of endogenous PMS2 protein
in GBM cells using MLH1 siRNA.
Stark et al. have demonstrated that MLH1
expression is significantly reduced in recurrent GBM, and

Equal numbers of cells (5×102) were inoculated into
each well and the cells were treated for 7 days with TMZ,
ACNU, MMS, or MNNG before the sensitivity of the cells
to each of the administered drugs was measured using a
MTT colorimetric assay as described previously [25].

Caspase-3 activation assay
U251 and U251/TMZR2 cells were seeded into a
6-cm tissue culture dish at a density of 2×105 cells. After
treatment with 800 micro-M TMZ for 96 h, the cells were
trypsinized, and caspase-3 activation assays were carried
out as described previously [26].

Measurement of apoptotic cells and cell-cycle
analysis by flow cytometry

Cells and cell culture
Human U251, U373, U105, LN229 GBM cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% foetal calf serum
and a 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). To isolate TMZ-resistant cells, U251
cells were cultured in selection medium containing 400
micro-M TMZ and cloned by using the limiting dilution
method. Three TMZ-resistant cells were then isolated
and named U251/TMZR1, U251/TMZR2 and U251/
TMZR3. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere.

U251 or U251/TMZR2 cells were seeded into
6-cm dishes at a density of 2×104 cells. After overnight
incubation, the cells were treated with 800 micro-M TMZ
for 24, 48 or 120 h. Measurements of apoptotic cells and
cell-cycle analysis were carried out by flow cytometry as
described previously [27].

researchers (Y.S and S.Y). Ratios of the positive cells were
obtained by dividing the number of immunopositive cells
by the total number of cells per field, and are expressed as
a percentage. Approval for this study was obtained from
the Clinical Study Review Board of Kagoshima University
Medical and Dental Hospital.

Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons were performed using
student’s t test. For immunohistochemical analysis,
statistical comparisons were performed using the paired t
test. Quantitative data were expressed as the means ± SD.
P < 0.05 were considered significant.

Protein extraction and immunoblotting
The cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA
buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mM p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl
fluoride hydrochloride (APMSF), and 1 micro-g/mL
aprotinin), passed through a 27-gauge needle, and
centrifuged at 14000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
was immediately used or was stored at -80 °C until use.
Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay kit. Cell lysates (100 micro-g protein)
were subjected to 7.4% or 9.4% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto
membranes as described previously [26]. The blotted
membranes were incubated with anti-MGMT (1:1000
dilution), anti-MLH1 (1:2000 dilution), anti-PMS2
(1:1000 dilution), anti-MSH6 (1:500 dilution), anti-MSH2
(1:1000 dilution), anti-beta-catenin (1:1000 dilution) or
anti-GAPDH (1:200000 dilution) antibody overnight at 4
o
C, and each protein was detected as described previously
[26].

Immunohistochemical analysis of patient tumours

REFERENCES

Tumour specimens were obtained from nine GBM
and two anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) patients. After the
first surgery, all patients were treated with TMZ (75 mg/m2
daily for 42 days) concurrent with conventional radiation
therapy (60 Gy), followed by TMZ (200 mg/m2) every
28 days according to the EORTC/NCIC-protocol [3] at
the Department of Neurosurgery, Kagoshima University
Hospital.
Surgically obtained specimens were fixed in 10%
formaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin before being
cut into 3 micro-m slices. Microwave antigen retrieval was
performed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) before the samples
were incubated with the MLH1 mouse monoclonal
antibody (1:100 dilution), PMS2 rabbit monoclonal
antibody (1:200 dilution), or the MGMT mouse
monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) as the primary
antibody. The number of cells in three microscopic fields
(magnification × 400) was counted independently by two
