Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) couples ligand activation of cell surface cytokine receptors to the
regulation of cellular functions including cell cycle progression, differentiation and apoptosis. It
thereby coordinates biological programs such as development and hematopoiesis. Unscheduled
activation of JAK2 by point mutations or chromosomal translocations can induce
hyperproliferation and hematological malignancies. Typical signal transduction by the JAK2
tyrosine kinase comprises phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors. In this study, we
describe the identification of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 as a novel
JAK2 substrate. JAK2 can directly bind and phosphorylate p27Kip1. Both, the JAK2 FERM
domain and its kinase domain bind to p27Kip1. JAK2 phosphorylates tyrosine residue 88 (Y88) of
p27Kip1. We previously reported that Y88 phosphorylation of p27Kip1 by oncogenic tyrosine
kinases impairs p27Kip1-mediated CDK inhibition, and initiates its ubiquitin-dependent
proteasomal degradation. Consistently, we now find that active oncogenic JAK2V617F reduces
p27Kip1 stability and protein levels in patient-derived cell lines harboring the mutant JAK2V617F
allele. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of p27Kip1 is impaired and p27Kip1 expression is
restored upon JAK2V617F inactivation by small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown or by the
pyridone-containing tetracycle JAK inhibitor-I, indicating that direct phosphorylation of p27Kip1
can contribute to hyperproliferation of JAK2V617F-transformed cells. Activation of endogenous
JAK2 by interleukin-3 (IL-3) induces Y88 phosphorylation of p27Kip1, thus unveiling a novel link
between cytokine signaling and cell cycle control in non-transformed cells. Oncogenic tyrosine
kinases could use this novel pathway to promote hyperproliferation in tumor cells.

Introduction
The decision between cell proliferation and cell cycle exit is orchestrated by signaling
networks that control the activity of specific cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes
(Morgan, 1997; Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009). Activation of G1-phase CDKs initiates
cell cycle entry and promotes cell cycle progression towards S-phase. Misregulated CDKs
induce unscheduled proliferation as well as genomic and chromosomal instability
(Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009). The CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 has a key role in controlling

CDKs and cell proliferation in response to diverse mitogenic or antiproliferative stimuli
(Chu et al., 2008). Non-proliferating cells are frequently characterized by elevated p27Kip1
levels that decline upon mitogenic stimulation (Hengst and Reed, 1996; Chu et al., 2008).
Binding of p27Kip1 usually inhibits CDK activity. However, p27Kip1 was also found in
active CDK complexes and surprisingly even contributes to CDK activation by promoting
assembly of active cyclin D/CDK holoenzymes (LaBaer et al., 1997; James et al., 2008;
Larrea et al., 2008; Ray et al., 2009). We recently identified a molecular switch that triggers
the transition of p27Kip1 from a CDK inhibitor to a potential activator of specific CDKs,
thus resulting in the conversion of a tumor suppressor into a potential oncogene. This
mechanism is based on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 88 (Y88) of p27Kip1, which
results in ejection of an inhibitory 310-helix of p27Kip1 from the ATP-binding pocket of the
CDK (Grimmler et al., 2007). The induced conformational change permits ATP binding of
the CDK and partially activates the p27Kip1-bound kinase (Chu et al., 2007, 2008; Grimmler
et al., 2007; James et al., 2008; Larrea et al., 2008; Ray et al., 2009). One substrate of
p27Kip1-bound CDK2 is Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1 itself. Activated CDK2 can now
phosphorylate cyclin/CDK-bound Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1 on threonine 187 (T187)
(Grimmler et al., 2007). Phosphorylated T187 is a pivotal core of the phosphodegron
recognized by the SCFSkp2 complex, which initiates the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent
degradation of p27Kip1 (Grimmler et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2008; Frescas and Pagano, 2008).
The p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation is induced upon mitogen stimulation, suggesting that
p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation may serve as a potent mechanism of direct signal integration.
Oncogenes like BCR-Abl use this mechanism to inactivate p27Kip1; however, molecular
pathways triggering this mechanism in normal cells remained undefined.

Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which can bind with its FERM
(band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain to the cytoplasmic tails of various transmembrane
cytokine receptors (Parganas et al., 1998). JAK2 activation by trans- or autophosphorylation
leads to downstream signaling including activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 5 (STAT5), phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI-3 K), mitogen-activated protein
kinase or Bcl-2 family members (Baker et al., 2007). Phosphorylated STAT5 proteins
enhance the transcription of apoptosis regulatory proteins like BCL-XL and cell cycle
regulators including cyclins D1, D2, E and the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 (Desrivieres et al.,
2006). JAK2 has a central role in hematopoiesis by regulating cell survival, proliferation and
differentiation (Baker et al., 2007). Constitutive activation of JAK2 can cause oncogenic
transformation (Ihle and Gilliland, 2007). Mutation of valine 617 to phenylalanine
(JAK2V617F) within its pseudokinase domain is one of the most common activating
mutations of JAK2, and JAK2V617F is the most frequent mutation in BCR-Abl negative
myeloproliferative disorders, with the highest incidence (95%) in polycythemia vera (PV)
(James et al., 2005; Kralovics et al., 2005; Levine et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2005).
Hyperproliferation induced by JAK2V617F involves activation of STAT5 and its
downstream targets (Walz et al., 2006; Wernig et al., 2008). It has been reported that
transcriptional downregulation of cyclin D2 and upregulation of p27Kip1 is a central
mechanism of growth arrest upon JAK2V617F inhibition (Walz et al., 2006). The decrease
of p27Kip1 upon JAK2V617F expression correlated with STAT5-induced expression of
Skp2, suggesting that the degradation of p27Kip1 could be a consequence of the
overexpression of this p27Kip1-directed ubiquitin ligase (Furuhata et al., 2009).
In this study, we describe the identification of p27Kip1 as a novel JAK2 substrate. JAK2
binds to p27Kip1 through its FERM and kinase domains and phosphorylates Y88 of p27Kip1.
This leads to partial activation of p27Kip1-bound CDK-cyclin complexes, and permits
SCFSkp2-dependent degradation of p27Kip1 (Grimmler et al., 2007). The p27Kip1-Y88
phosphorylation is induced upon JAK2 activation by interleukin-3 (IL-3), and decreased by
JAK2 inactivation. Substantial Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1 was detected in patient-derived

JAK2V617F positive hematopoietic cell lines. Inactivation of JAK2V617F reduced Y88p27Kip1 phosphorylation and resulted in a concomitant increase of p27Kip1 protein and cell
cycle arrest. These observations directly connect JAK2-mediated cytokine receptor signaling
with the core cell cycle machinery, and uncover a novel pathway that can contribute to
hyperproliferation induced by deregulated JAK2 activation.

p27Kip1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated upon IL-3 stimulation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We and others recently reported that serum stimulation can cause p27Kip1 tyrosine
phosphorylation (Grimmler et al., 2007; James et al., 2008). Therefore, we aimed to
determine mitogenic stimuli that induce this phosphorylation and to identify p27Kip1phosphorylating kinases. Cytokines are important positive and negative regulators of the cell
cycle and can stimulate quiescent cells to proliferate. For example, IL-3 is required to
maintain proliferation of different hematopoietic cell types, and its withdrawal leads to cell
cycle arrest in G1-phase (Kelvin et al., 1986). Investigating IL-3 induced p27Kip1
modifications in the IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3, we observed a strong
induction of p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation shortly after IL-3 stimulation, whereas no
p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation was detected upon deprivation of the cytokine (Figure 1a).
The p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation in response to IL-3 was also observed in IL-3 dependent
murine myeloblast 32D cells (Supplementary Figure 1). IL-3 receptor signaling activates
JAK2 (Parganas et al., 1998), which was traced by its Y1007/1008 phosphorylation (Feng et
al., 1997). JAK2 activation as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of its substrate STAT5A/B
was detected 5 min after IL-3 stimulation, slightly preceding the peak of p27Kip1-Y88
phosphorylation (Figure 1a). Activation of Src family kinases, monitored by an antibody
recognizing activated Src and related kinases, indicates no change in activity at time points
investigated (Figure 1a). The coincidence of JAK2 activation and p27Kip1 tyrosine
phosphorylation lead us to investigate whether JAK2 could initiate p27Kip1 phosphorylation.
Incubation of Ba/F3 cells with the JAK kinase-specific pyridone-containing tetracycle ‘JAK
inhibitor-I’ (Thompson et al., 2002) before IL-3 stimulation, led to a decline in Y1007/1008phosphorylated JAK2 as well as Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1 (Figure 1b), indicating that
JAK2 activation is a prerequisite for p27Kip1 Y88 phosphorylation.
JAK2 phosphorylates p27Kip1 on tyrosine 88
As p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation shortly followed IL-3 stimulation and JAK2 activation
(Figure 1a), we investigated whether activation of JAK2 was sufficient to phosphorylate
p27Kip1. We transfected 293T cells with p27Kip1 in the presence and absence of JAK2.
Coexpression of JAK2 and p27Kip1 resulted in intense tyrosine phosphorylation of p27Kip1,
and treatment with the JAK inhibitor-I strongly reduced this phosphorylation (Figure 2a,
Supplementary Figure 2) as well as JAK2-Y1007/1008 phosphorylation (Figure 2a). In
addition to Y88, p27Kip1 comprises only two additional tyrosine residues, which are also
located within its CDK-inhibitory domain. Using p27Kip1 phospho-Y88-specific antibodies,
we identified Y88 as major phosphorylation site upon JAK2 expression (Figure 2a) and IL-3
stimulation (Figure 1). The p27Kip1-Y88F and p27Kip1-Y88/89F mutants were poor
substrates for JAK2-induced phosphorylation (Figure 2b), indicating that JAK2
preferentially phosphorylates Y88. In all, 80% of p27Kip1 tyrosine phosphorylation is lost if
Y88 is exchanged to phenylalanine (Figure 2b). The remaining signal was reduced to 3.4%
by mutating Y89 in addition to Y88, indicating that Y89 might be a second, low-affinity
phosphorylation site. To investigate if JAK2 can directly phosphorylate p27Kip1, and to
determine which tyrosines become phosphorylated, we incubated purified recombinant
p27Kip1 with the purified JAK2 kinase domain. Direct phosphorylation of p27Kip1 by JAK2
was observed in kinase assays (Figure 2c). To identify tyrosine residues that can be

phosphorylated by JAK2 in vitro, we replaced one, combinations of two or all three
tyrosines of p27Kip1 with phenylalanine. Efficient phosphorylation of p27Kip1 by JAK2
required the presence of Y88, whereas mutations of Y89 or Y74 to phenylalanine failed to
reduce p27Kip1 phosphorylation (Figure 2c). These data suggest a direct phosphorylation of
tyrosine residue 88 of p27Kip1 by JAK2.

p27Kip1 binds to the FERM and the kinase domains of JAK2
If JAK2 directly phosphorylates p27Kip1, these proteins might associate in a stable complex.
This could occur through direct binding or involve additional bridging proteins. To
investigate direct binding of JAK2 to p27Kip1, we first analyzed the interaction of purified
recombinant His-p27Kip1 with recombinant GST-JAK2 in vitro. To exclude co-purification
of interacting eukaryotic proteins, both recombinant proteins were isolated from E.coli. Pulldown of GST-JAK2 on glutathione beads co-precipitated p27Kip1, indicating that both
proteins can form a stable complex in vitro (Figure 3a). We next expressed p27Kip1 and
JAK2 in 293T cells, where JAK2 co-precipitated with p27Kip1, and p27Kip1 co-precipitated
with JAK2 (Figure 3b). To test if the endogenous proteins interact under physiological
conditions, we precipitated JAK2 from the mouse Ba/F3 pro-B cells and activated
JAK2V617F from the human erythroleukemia cell line HEL. Importantly, endogenous
p27Kip1 co-immunoprecipitates with JAK2 as well as with JAK2V617F (Figure 3c). These
data support the hypothesis that p27Kip1 is a direct substrate of JAK2, which binds to
p27Kip1 and phosphorylates Y88 of p27Kip1. To further characterize the p27Kip1-JAK2
interaction, we investigated binding of p27Kip1 to four domains of JAK2, representing the
entire protein: the FERM-, SH2-like-, pseudokinase- and the kinase domain (Figure 3d,
(Zhao et al., 1995)). Full-length JAK2, the N-terminal FERM- and the C-terminal kinase
domain of JAK2 precipitate p27Kip1 (Figure 3e). A weak interaction was observed with the
pseudokinase domain. Immunoprecipitation of p27Kip1 and analysis of the co-precipitated
JAK2 fragments confirmed this interaction (data not shown).
Localization of JAK2, p27Kip1 and Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

JAK2 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and frequently associated with the
cytoplasmic tails of cytokine receptors. The p27Kip1 can shuttle between the nucleus and the
cytoplasm (Connor et al., 2003), and phosphorylation by several kinases including Akt/PKB
leads to its translocation to the cytoplasm (Chu et al., 2008). To investigate if the
localization of p27Kip1 and JAK2 overlaps and to determine where Y88-phosphorylated
p27Kip1 accumulates, we performed immunofluorescence experiments and biochemical
fractionations. Transfection of U2OS and 293T cells with p27Kip1 and JAK2 or JAK2V617F
revealed that Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1 was highly abundant in the cytoplasm (Figure 4a,
panels 1, 5, 9, 13), as seen for active JAK2 (Figure 4a, panel 6), or JAK2V617F (Figure 4a,
panel 14) (Supplementary Figure 3). p27Kip1 could be detected in the nucleus and the
cytoplasm (Figure 4a, panels 2, 10). Endogenous Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1 of HEL
erythroleukemia cells also localized predominantly within the cytoplasm (Figure 4b, panels
1, 3). To confirm the subcellular localization, we fractionated extracts from HEL- and Ba/F3
cells. In line with the immunofluorescence data, endogenous Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1
was mainly present in the cytosolic fraction, together with p27Kip1 and JAK2V617F (HEL
cells) or JAK2 (Ba/F3 cells) (Figures 4c and d).
Activated JAK2V617F of human leukemia cell lines phosphorylates p27Kip1 and decreases
its stability
The JAK2V617F mutant transforms hematopoietic progenitors and is a common mutation in
myeloproliferative disease (Levine and Gilliland, 2007). JAK2V617F permits ILindependent growth of the IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3 (Furuhata et al., 2009). Inhibition
of the activated kinase leads to increased p27Kip1 levels and decreased cyclin D2 levels, and

arrests human erythroleukemia HEL cells in G1-phase (Walz et al., 2006; Furuhata et al.,
2009). To ascertain Y88 phosphorylation of p27Kip1 by JAK2V617F in vivo, we
investigated p27Kip1 regulation in two patient-derived leukemia cell lines naturally
expressing JAK2V617F: the human erythroleukemia cell line HEL and the acute myeloid
leukemia-derived cell line SET2. We observed that p27Kip1 is extensively phosphorylated
on Y88 in both cell lines. Inactivation of JAK2 by JAK inhibitor-I strongly decreased
p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation (Figures 5a and b). Interestingly, an increase in p27Kip1
protein could be observed already 1 h after treatment (Figures 5a and b). We reported earlier
that tyrosine-88 phosphorylation of p27Kip1 enhances its SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitinproteasomal degradation and decreases its Cdk-cyclin inhibitory potential (Chu et al., 2007,
2008; Grimmler et al., 2007). Consistent with this observation, we now find that p27Kip1
stability is increased upon JAK2 inactivation (Figure 5c, Supplementary Figure 5), and that
p27-Y88F leads to a stronger reduction of HEL cells in S-phase than wild-type p27Kip1
(Supplementary Figure 6). It has been proposed that p27Kip1 accumulation by JAK2
inhibition is due to decreased Skp2 expression (Agarwal et al., 2008; Furuhata et al., 2009).
We observed that Skp2 levels remained unchanged at early time points of JAK2 inhibition,
and only decreased after 4 h of JAK inhibitor-I treatment (Supplementary Figure 4). To
exclude that JAK inhibitor-I might act on additional kinases, we used small hairpin RNAmediated JAK2 knockdown using established small hairpin RNAs (Neilson et al., 2007).
Silencing of JAK2 expression resulted in a loss of p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation and
increased p27Kip1 levels, whereas Skp2 levels remained unchanged (Figure 5d). Consistent
with earlier observations (Walz et al., 2006), we observed an increase of cells in G0/G1phase and a decrease of cells in S-phase, indicating that depletion of JAK2 delays or arrests
cells in G0/G1 phase (Supplementary Figure 7). As Skp2 expression remained unchanged,
despite the significant loss of p27Kip1 phosphorylation and cell cycle delay/arrest, these data
support the model that inhibition of Skp2 expression is not essential for p27Kip1 stabilization
after JAK2 inhibition.

Discussion
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We have recently identified p27Kip1 tyrosine phosphorylation as an important molecular
mechanism that impairs function and stability of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 in the presence
of mitogens, leading to partial CDK activation and cell cycle progression (Grimmler et al.,
2007; Chu et al., 2008; Ray et al., 2009). Oncogenic tyrosine kinases like BCR-Abl can
phosphorylate and inactivate p27Kip1; however, specific kinases phosphorylating p27Kip1
during mitogen-induced cell cycle entry remained unknown. In this study, we describe that
cytokine-induced JAK2 activation triggers Y88–phosphorylation of p27Kip1. JAK2 can
directly bind and phosphorylate p27Kip1. Thus, the identification of JAK2 as a p27Kip1-Y88phosphorylating kinase now provides a novel and direct link between cytokine signaling and
cell cycle control in untransformed cells.
The p27Kip1 can form a complex with JAK2 that is stable enough to be immunoprecipitated
(Figure 3). The FERM domain and the kinase domain of JAK2 bind to p27Kip1. As fulllength JAK2 bound p27Kip1 more efficiently than single domains (Figure 3e), both domains
seem to cooperate for efficient binding. Activation of JAK2 can trigger diverse biological
responses including cell proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis. JAK2 links cytokine
stimulation to p27Kip1 phosphorylation, leading to its inactivation and elimination. However,
ligand binding to cytokine receptors does not always promote cell proliferation. Depending
on the cell type, cytokines like oncostatin M can even prevent cell proliferation and induce
p27Kip1 (Halfter et al., 2006). Therefore, activated JAK2 may not always phosphorylate and
inactivate p27Kip1. It is tempting to speculate that the ability of JAK2 to bind and inactivate
p27Kip1 might be cell type specific and regulated. For example, the p27Kip1–JAK2
interaction may be inhibited by modifications such as phosphorylation or by competing

binding partners including various cytokine receptors. Finally, regulation of the subcellular
localization of p27Kip1 or active JAK2 may determine the efficiency of p27Kip1
phosphorylation and inactivation by JAK2.

JAK2 associates with the cytoplasmic tail of cytokine receptors, but also with receptor
tyrosine kinases and seven transmembrane-spanning receptors (Wallace and Sayeski, 2006).
In addition, active JAK2V617F was recently detected in the nucleus (Dawson et al., 2009).
Even though Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1 accumulated in the cytosol under the conditions
here, it remains to be determined where JAK2 can phosphorylate p27Kip1. Depending on its
cellular context and mode of activation, JAK2 may phosphorylate p27Kip1 in different
cellular compartments. Previously, tyrosine-phosphorylated p27Kip1 was detected in the
nucleus and it was speculated that tyrosine phosphorylation leads to nuclear translocation of
p27Kip1 (Kardinal et al., 2006; Tossidou et al., 2008; Ray et al., 2009). We now observe that
endogenous Y88-phosphorylated p27Kip1 in the hematopoietic cell lines HEL and Ba/F3, as
well as overexpressed p27Kip1 phosphorylated by JAK2 in U2OS and 293T cells is
predominantly cytoplasmic (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 3), indicating that Y88
phosphorylation alone is insufficient to restrain p27Kip1 to the nucleus.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The p27Kip1 is Y88-phosphorylated in myeloid cell lines expressing the active JAK2V617F
variant (Figures 5a and b). Inactivation of JAK2V617F reduces Y88 phosphorylation of
p27Kip1 and leads to its concomitant increase and enhanced stability. Our recent observation
that Y88 phosphorylation by oncogenic tyrosine kinase BCR-Abl triggers premature Skp2dependent p27Kip1 proteosomal degradation (Grimmler et al., 2007), is well in line with our
observation here that inhibition of oncogenic JAK2V617F can reestablish p27Kip1 stability
and expression. In both JAK2V617F-expressing cell lines investigated, increased p27Kip1
protein could already be detected 1 h after JAK inhibitor-I addition, indicating that p27Kip1
stabilization is an immediate consequence of JAK2V617F inactivation. Immediately after
IL-3 stimulation (15 and 30 min), we detected an increase of Y88 phosphorylation without a
significant decline of p27Kip1 levels (Figure 1). As the half-life of p27Kip1 is significantly
longer than these short time points, effects on overall protein level would need more time to
build up. Recent reports proposed that JAK2V617F activity leads to decreased p27Kip1
stability by transcriptional induction of Skp2 involving STAT5 (Agarwal et al., 2008;
Furuhata et al., 2009). The increase of p27Kip1 after 24-h JAK inhibitor-I treatment
correlated with decreased Skp2 expression (Agarwal et al., 2008). In HEL cells, we
observed no decline in Skp2 levels for up to 8 h of JAK inhibitor-I treatment
(Supplementary Figure 4a), and importantly, p27Kip1 protein levels increase already at
earlier time points, when Skp2 level remain unchanged (Figures 5a and b). Skp2 expression
itself is regulated during cell cycle progression and the protein is degraded in early G1-phase
after ubiquitination by APCCdh1 (Wei et al., 2004; Frescas and Pagano, 2008). As other cell
cycle-regulated proteins including cyclin E and cyclin D2 also decline after extended JAK
Inhibitor-I incubation (16 h, Supplementary Figure 4b), it cannot be excluded that this
decline of Skp2 level might also result from cell cycle synchrony in early G1-phase. In
addition, knockdown of JAK2 expression by RNA interference abolished p27Kip1-Y88
phosphorylation and led to accumulation of p27Kip1, with no change in Skp2 protein level
(Figure 5d). Together, these data indicate that p27Kip1 regulation by JAK2 can occur
independently from Skp2 expression. However, it is clear that Y88-triggered p27Kip1
degradation at the G1/S transition requires Skp2 expression as well as sufficient SCFSkp2 E3
ubiquitin ligase activity (Chu et al., 2008; Frescas and Pagano, 2008). Cells expressing
insufficient Skp2 protein, therefore, may require additional induction of Skp2 in order to
overcome a p27Kip1-imposed cell cycle arrest and to proliferate.
The p27Kip1 is a negative regulator of hematopoietic progenitor proliferation. JAK2V617F

maturation (Levine and Gilliland, 2007; Bruchova et al., 2009). Ex vivo culture of primary
erythroid progenitors recently revealed that p27Kip1 was increased at certain stages of
erythroid differentiation in cells from healthy subjects, whereas p27Kip1 levels remained low
in erythroid cells from PV patients. Low p27Kip1 in erythroid PV cells correlated with high
proliferation (Bruchova et al., 2009). It is therefore tempting to speculate that p27Kip1-Y88
phosphorylation by JAK2V617F might also have a role in PV development. Initial data
indicate that p27Kip1 is extensively phosphorylated on Y88 in PV patients with high levels
of active JAK2. Skp2 expression neither correlated with active JAK2 nor with p27Kip1
levels in these primary cells (H Jäkel, D Wolf, L Hengst; unpublished results).
JAK2 inhibitors prove to be effective in controlling hyperproliferation and symptom
reduction in PV, although they merely eliminate mutant clones (Verstovsek, 2009). Y88
phosphorylation of p27Kip1 could contribute to JAK2V617F-dependent hyperproliferation
and transformation in this and other hematological malignancies. JAK inhibitors may reduce
hyperproliferation in part by preventing p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation-induced inactivation
and degradation.
The phosphorylation of p27Kip1 by JAK2 provides a novel exciting mechanism, by which
JAK2 can directly impinge on cell cycle progression in normal and transformed cells. The
identification of p27Kip1 as target of JAK2 and JAK2V617F could open new avenues for
diagnosis, as well as targeted therapeutic intervention in JAK2-dependent myeloproliferative
diseases.

HEL and Ba/F3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
propagated as recommended. The 293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate. For
a 6 cm dish, 2 μg HA-p27 PCDNA3.1 plasmid and 3 μg of JAK2 pCMX plasmid were
transfected. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HA-p27 plasmid and Flag-JAK2 plasmid
or indicated Flag-JAK2 domains were transfected. 40 h after transfection, cells were washed
in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline containing 1 mM pervanadate and lysed in 0.5% NP-40
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, phosphatase inhibitors
(Phosphostop, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA)). For immunoblot analysis of p27Kip1 and p27Kip1-Y88
phosphorylation, protein extracts were boiled at 65 °C for 10 min, and the heat labile
proteins were precipitated by centrifugation at 16 000 r.p.m. for 15 min. The cleared
supernatant containing heat stable proteins such as p27Kip1 (Hengst et al., 1994) was
separated by SDS–PAGE. The subsequent immunoblot analyses were performed by using
ECL (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or Odyssey infrared
fluorescence detection (Li-Cor, Bad Homburg, Germany) technologies.

Mammalian HA-p27Kip1 and its tyrosine mutants in the pcDNA3.1 vector as well as
bacterial His-p27Kip1 and its tyrosine mutants in the pET28a vector were described
previously (Grimmler et al., 2007). N- and C-terminus of JAK2 cDNA (a kind gift from W

full-length JAK2 the 1.6 kb XhoI-NdeI fragment of the JAK2 cDNA was inserted via
ligation into the pDONR-JAK2 plasmid (pENTR-JAK2). To generate expression vectors
containing JAK2 fragments, entry vectors were generated via PCR with specific primers and
recombination with pDONR207 was performed. The JAK2V617F construct was cloned by a
two-step PCR. The PCR fragment and the pENTR-JAK2 plasmid were digested with

Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation and cell fractionation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For co-precipitation experiments, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM (4(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES) pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X100,
Phosphostop (Roche) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)) and centrifugated at 16 000
r.p.m. for 20 min. Transfected HA-p27Kip1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA
antibodies covalently linked to protein A-Sepharose (Immunosorb A; EC Diagnostics AB,
Uppsala, Sweden), and Flag-JAK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies. After
SDS–PAGE, western blot analysis was performed with anti-Flag- and mouse anti-p27Kip1horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies. For co-immunopreciptation analysis of
endogenous proteins, JAK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 agarose beads.
Immunoblot analyses were performed with mouse anti-JAK2 antibodies and mouse antip27Kip1-horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody. For subcellular fractionation, protein
extracts were separated into nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane compartments (Behrmann
et al., 2004). Briefly, cells were incubated in hypotonic lysis buffer and homogenized using
a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation at 1000 g, 10 min,
and washed twice with lysis buffer. The nuclei were lysed in a detergent-containing buffer
(20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1% Triton ×100, 280 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, protease- and phosphatase inhibitors), and insoluble
proteins were precipitated by centrifugation. The crude cytoplasmic fraction was centrifuged
at 20 000 g and the pellet (membranes) was solubilized in membrane lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1% Triton ×100, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), 1mM dithiothreitol , protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The supernatant was
once more centrifuged (100 000 g) to obtain the cytosolic fraction.

GST-pulldown assay

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Recombinant GST-JAK2 fusion protein was expressed in E.coli, isolated in lysis buffer (137
mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.5% Triton ×100) and
purified by binding to gluthathione Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). GSTJAK2 was incubated with recombinant purified His-p27Kip1 for 90 min. After repeated
washing in lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted in SDS–PAGE at 95 °C and analyzed by
western blot.
In vitro kinase assays
Kinase reactions were performed by incubating purified recombinant His-p27Kip1 or Hisp27Kip1 tyrosine mutants with the GST-JAK2 kinase domain (amino acid 752–1129 of
mouse JAK2; ProQinase, Freiburg, Germany) in kinase buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2,
150 mM NaCl, 20 mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid)/KOH pH 7.5,
0.05% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 625 μM Na-ortho-vanadate, 50 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 1 μg/μl aprotinin/leupeptin, 100 μM ATP
and 10 μCi γ-32P-ATP (NEN)) for 30 min at 35 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS–
PAGE, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen (GE
Healthcare). Incorporation of radioactive phosphate into p27Kip1 was quantified with a
Typhoon 9410 scanner (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).

JAK2 phosphorylates p27Kip1 on tyrosine residue 88 in vitro and in vivo. (a) Incubation of
JAK2-transfected 293T cells with 3 μM JAK inhibitor-I for 3 h impairs p27Kip1 tyrosine-88phosphorylation. HA-p27Kip1 was co-transfected with JAK2 in 293T cells. Extracts were
boiled (65 °C; 10 min) to precipitate the majority of the proteins. Levels of the heat stable
p27Kip1 and its phosphorylation on tyrosines were simultaneously determined by the
Odyssey infrared imaging system. Overall phospho-tyrosine was detected using the 4G10
antibody, and p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation was detected by a specific p27Kip1-pY88
monoclonal antibody. Quantitative analyses of these signals (adjusted to 100% for wild-type
p27Kip1 when co-expressed with JAK2, and corrected for p27Kip1 expression levels) are

immunoblotting. IP, immunoprecipitation, WCE, whole cell extract. (b) SET-2 cells were
analyzed as in (a). (c) p27Kip1 stability increases upon JAK2V617F inhibition. HEL cells
were incubated with JAK inhibitor-I (3 μM) or the solvent (ethanol). After 4 h incubation,
cycloheximide (CHX) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and cells were
incubated for the indicated periods of time. p27Kip1 expression was determined in
immunoblots. The α-tubulin was used as a loading control. Lower panel: immunoblot
signals were quantified (Gel Pro Analyser software, Media Cybernetics) and intensities were
adjusted to 100% at 0 h and plotted over time. The exponential decay curve, determined by
regression analysis, is shown (GraphPad Prism5 software, La Jolla, CA, USA). (d)
Knockdown of JAK2V617F in HEL cells reduces p27Kip1-Y88 phosphorylation and
increases p27Kip1 levels. HEL cells were electroporated with control (‘scramble’) or JAK2specific small hairpin RNA (pLKO1.puro plasmids, (Neilson et al., 2007) and incubated for
40 h. p27Kip1-pY88 immunoprecipitates, p27Kip1, JAK2, Skp2 and α-tubulin were detected
in immunoblots.
