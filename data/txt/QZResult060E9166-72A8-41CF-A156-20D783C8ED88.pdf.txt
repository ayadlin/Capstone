BACKGROUND: F-box protein 32 (FBXO32) (also known as atrogin-1), a member of the F-box protein family, has recently been identified as a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b)/Smad target gene involved in regulating cell survival, and it may be transcriptionally silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in some kinds of carcinomas, yet its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has
not been defined. METHODS: The role of FBXO32 in ESCC and the correlation of FBXO32 methylation with a series of pathologic parameters were studied in a large cohort of patients with ESCC. RESULTS: Decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein
expression of FBXO32 were observed in esophageal cancer cell lines, and the silencing of FBXO32 could be reversed by treatment
with 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine or trichostatin A in the TE13 cell line. In addition, aberrant methylation of FBXO32 and histone deacetylation was capable of suppressing FBXO32 mRNA and protein expression in TE13 cells. Decreased mRNA and protein expression of
FBXO32 was observed in ESCC tumor tissues and was associated with FBXO32 promoter methylation status. A positive correlation
between FBXO32 and phosphorylated SMAD family members 2 and 3 expression and Smad4 protein expression also was observed
in clinical specimens. FBXO32 methylation status and protein expression were independently associated with survival in patients with
ESCC. CONCLUSIONS: FBXO32 may be a functional tumor suppressor. Its inactivation through promoter methylation could play an
important role in ESCC carcinogenesis, and reactivation of the FBXO32 gene may have therapeutic potential and might be used as a

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common malignancy and the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death
worldwide.1 Because its prevalence and death rate are continuously increasing, it has become a major health concern.2
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant type of esophageal cancer, comprising almost 95% of
cases. Because of the high incidence and poor survival, ESCC is 1 of the major health issues in China, especially in some
counties bordering Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi Provinces. The precise molecular mechanisms of development and/or progression of ESCC remain unknown, although multiple genetic and epigenetic changes have been detected in ESCC.3,4
Therefore, additional elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in ESCC is urgently needed for more effective
treatment.
F-box protein 32 (FBXO32) (also known as atrogin-1) is a member of the F-box protein family and constitutes 1 of
the 4 subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex involved in muscle atrophy.5,6 However, recent findings have demonstrated that FBXO32 may have a potential tumor suppressor function and that the v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (AKT) (protein kinase B) signaling pathway negatively regulates FBXO32.7 Furthermore, it has been reported that
FBXO32 contributes to 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep)-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells, thus suggesting that it
also may be involved in regulating cell survival.8 More recently, it has been demonstrated that FBXO32 is transcriptionally
silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and that the
methylation status of FBXO32 may predict survival in patients with ovarian cancer.8,9 Furthermore, Qin et al have

identified FBXO32 as a transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-)b/Smad target gene in ovarian surface epithelial
cells using the chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-Chip) method.10 The TGF-b signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of numerous
effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, migration,
and survival. The loss of the TGF-b response is well
known for its contribution to oncogenesis and tumor
progression.11,12
Even with the potential importance of the FBXO32
gene in carcinogenesis, there has been very little investigation into the role of the FBXO32 gene in ESCC. In the
current study, we attempted to ascertain the role of
FBXO32 in ESCC and the correlation of FBXO32 methylation status to a series of pathologic parameters in a large
sample of patients with ESCC to elucidate more information on the role of FBXO32 with regard to the pathogenesis of ESCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures and treatments, cell proliferation assays, the
effects of FBXO32 on regulating apoptosis, the transfection of small-interfering RNA (siRNA), and Western blot
analyses all are described in the supporting materials (see
online supporting information).
Patients and Specimens

All study patients were of ethnically homogeneous Han
nationality and were residents of Hebei Province and its
surrounding regions. Tumor samples and corresponding
adjacent normal tissues were obtained from 132 patients
with ESCC who were admitted as inpatients for surgical
treatment at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Hebei Medical University between the years 2005 and 2007. The
patients included 93 men and 39 women, and the mean
patient age was 58.7 years (age range, 37-78 years). Individuals with at least 1 first-degree relative or at least 2
second-degree relatives who had esophageal/cardia/gastric
cancer were defined as a having family history of upper
gastrointestinal cancers (UGICs). Tumor samples and
corresponding normal tissues were divided into 2 parallel
parts: 1 part was frozen and stored at 280 C until DNA
and RNA were extracted, and the other part was fixed in
formalin and embedded in paraffin. Histologic tumor
typing of the samples was carried out on the basis of
resected specimens in the Department of Pathology at the
same hospital. Information on clinicopathologic characteristics was available from hospital recordings and pathologic diagnoses. Recurrence and survival data were
ascertained through the tumor registry and hospital chart

review (Supporting Table 1; see online supporting information). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hebei Cancer Institute, and informed consent was
obtained from all participating patients.
Stable Gene Transfections

To investigate the overexpression of FBXO32, exponentially grown TE13 cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected with FBXO32 expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1FBXO32) or with the relevant empty vector (pcDNA3.1EV) as a control. The expression plasmid contained the
full-length combinational DNA (cDNA) of FBXO32.
ChIP Assay

A ChIP assay was performed using the kit from Upstate
Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) as described previously.13 Antibodies against dimethylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2), dimethylated histone H3 at lysine 9
(H3K9me2), and acetylated histone H3 at lysine 9
(H3K9ac) (Millipore Corporation, Inc., Billerica, Mass)
were used for immunoprecipitation. The following
FBXO32specific primers were used to perform real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses from immunoprecipitated DNA as well as input samples: forward, 50 GGTCGATCCTGATAGCTCGG-30 ; and reverse, 50 GTGGAAACTTGAAGCGGTGC-30 . These primers
amplified a 251-base pair (bp) region overlapping the
cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island within the
FBXO32 promoter. Amplifications were performed in
triplicate, and enrichment was determined by comparing
the results with input values.
Regular Reverse Transcriptase-PCR and
Quantitative Real-Time Reverse TranscriptasePCR Assays

Total RNA was extracted from cell lines treated or
untreated with 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), or trichostatin A (TSA), or calmodulin-binding protein (CBP);
from the stable transfected TE13 clones; and from the frozen tumor sections and corresponding normal tissues with
standard methods using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, Calif). Two micrograms of RNA were used to
synthesize cDNA with the advantage reverse
transcriptase-PCR (RT-for-PCR) kit (Clontech, Palo
Alto, Calif) with oligo (dT) priming as recommended in
the protocol provided. cDNA from each sample was used
for a regular RT-PCR and quantitative real-time RTPCR template, and primers for FBXO32 were used as previously described.9 The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as an internal
control. All primers and reaction conditions are listed in
2413

Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting information).
For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, power SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif)
was used as an amplification reaction mixture according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The product of
FBXO32 was normalized by using the product of
GAPDH. All samples were run in triplicate.
FBXO32 Luciferase Constructs

To explore the transcriptional regulation of FBXO32,
three promoter reporter plasmids were constructed:
FBXO32-F1, spanning from 2851 to 1200 bp;
FBXO32-F2, spanning from 2600 to 1200 bp; and
FBXO32-F3, spanning from 2300 to 1200 bp. The
amplified fragments were inserted into the pGL3-basic
vector (Promega, Madison, Wis) between the XhoI and
HindIII sites. These recombination plasmids were then
sequenced for confirmation.
Luciferase Assay

TE13 cells (1 3 105 cells per well) were seeded onto a 24well dish 24 hours before transfection. In all, 200 ng of
FBXO32 deletion constructs (FBXO32-F1, FBXO32F2, and FBXO32-F3), pGL3-control vector construct
(positive control), or pGL3-basic vector construct (negative control) were cotransfected with 10 ng of the herpes
simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter vector pRL-TK
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega). Promoter activity was expressed as the
ratio of Firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity, and
each data point was determined in triplicate.
In Vitro DNA Methylation

Construct pGL3-F3 was methylated in vitro as described
previously.14 Then, 200 ng of mock or SSI-treated vector
were transfected in TE13 cells. After 48 hours, luciferase
and Renilla activity were assayed as described above.
Immunocytochemical and Immunohistochemical
Staining

Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate FBXO32
expression in four 5-Aza-dC-treated or untreated esophageal cancer cell lines. FBXO32, phosphorylated SMAD
family members 2 and 3 (p-Smad2/3), and SMAD family
member 4 (Smad4) expression was determined by immunostaining using the avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method, which was performed on parallel
histopathologic sections from paraffin-embedded tumor
sections and corresponding normal tissues. Rabbit antihuman polyclonal antibody for FBXO32 (1:200 dilution;
2414

Abcam plc, Cambridge, United Kingdom), goat antihuman polyclonal antibody for p-Smad2/3 (1:200 dilution;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif), or
mouse antihuman monoclonal antibody Smad4 (1:200
dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was applied to
sections to detect protein expression of FBXO32, pSmad2/3, or Smad4, respectively. For a negative control,
the primary antibody was replaced with mouse immunoglobulin G. Slides with positive staining for FBXO32, pSmad2/3, or Smad4 were used as positive controls.
Immunohistochemical staining was evaluated
according to a previously reported scoring method.15 The
scores accounted for both the areas stained and the intensity of the staining. All slides were examined and scored by
3 independent observers who were blinded to the clinical
data. All slides were reviewed concurrently by 3 experienced pathologists.
Methylation Analysis of FBXO32

Total DNA was isolated from 5-Aza-dC-treated and
untreated cells using DNAzol (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s recommendation. Genomic DNA
from tumor sections and corresponding normal tissues
was isolated from flash-frozen tissues using a simplified
Proteinase K digestion method. To examine the DNA
methylation patterns, genomic DNA was treated with
sodium bisulfite as described previously.16 The methylation status of FBXO32 was then determined by bisulfite
genomic sequencing and the bisulfite conversion-specific
and methylation-specific PCR (BS-MSP) method, as
described previously.9,17 For bisulfite genomic sequencing, primers were designed to recognize sodium bisulfiteconverted DNA encompassing CpG islands 1 and 2
within the human FBXO32 gene CpG island of the promoter (from 2624 to 2106 bp). For BS-MSP, the promoter region (from 2475 to 2288 bp) of the FBXO32
gene was analyzed. The primers and reaction conditions
are provided in Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting
information). Genomic DNA, which was methylated in
vitro using CpG methyltransferase (SssI) according to the
manufacturer’s directions (New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass), was used as a positive control, and a water
blank was used as a negative control. Reactions were performed in duplicate for each of the samples.
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software package (version 13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Ill). The results of RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and
Western blot analyses were expressed as the

expression was remarkably reduced or silenced in the
TE13, T.Tn, and Yes-2 cell lines. This finding was confirmed by the results from Western blot analysis and
immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1C,D). However, treatment
with 5-Aza-dC increased the level of mRNA and the
expression of FBXO32 in the TE13, T.Tn, and Yes-2 cell
lines, consistent with the notion that promoter methylation does repress the expression of FBXO32 in esophageal
cancer cell lines.

Treatment with 5-Aza-dC, or TSA, or CBP resulted in
the up-regulation of FBXO32 in TE13 cells, and the
combination of 5-Aza-dC and TSA resulted in significant up-regulation of FBXO32 in these cells, as illustrated in Figure 2A-C. Increased mRNA and protein

Two CpG islands are depicted, and the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) region analyzed is indicated. (B)
High-resolution mapping of the methylation status of every CpG site in the FBXO32 promoter was accomplished using bisulfite
genomic sequencing (BGS) in 4 esophageal cancer cell lines (TE1, TE13, T.Tn, and Yes-2). A 495-base pair (bp) region spanning
the promoter with 50 CpG sites was analyzed. Each CpG site is indicated in the top row as an individual number. The percentage
of methylation was determined as the percentage of methylated cytosine from 8 to 10 sequenced colonies. The shading of circles
for each CpG site represents the percentage of methylation. (C) Methylation status of the FBXO32 promoter was determined by
bisulfite conversion-specific and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in various tumor cell lines with or without 5-aza20 -deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) treatment. M indicates methylated; U, unmethylated; 2, negative; 1, positive. (D) Luciferase activity
of the promoter constructs FBXO32-F1 (F1), FBXO32-F2 (F2), and FBXO32-F3 (F3) is illustrated. pGL3-control vector was used
as a positive control (POS), and empty pGL3-basic vector was used as a negative control (EV). FBXO32-F3 had the highest relative luciferase activity. Asterisks indicate P <.05 compared with EV. (E) The promoter region from 2300 to 1200 base pairs was
methylated in vitro, cloned into pGL3 vector, and luciferase activity was determined and compared with that of unmethylated
FBXO32-F3. In vitro methylation of FBXO32-F3 led to a significant decrease in luciferase activity. The asterisk indicates P <.05.

were observed in FBXO32 stably transfected TE13 cells
(Supporting Fig. 2). After siRNA for FBXO32 was transfected in TE1 cells, significantly decreased expression of
FBXO32 and inhibition of apoptosis were observed, and
these effects could be reversed in part by CBP treatment
(Supporting Fig. 3) (see online supporting information).
The Aberrant Promoter Methylation of FBXO32
Induces Silencing of FBXO32 Expression

The MethPrimer program18 and the CpG Island
Searcher19 were used to determine whether the sequence
of FBXO32 contains CpG islands. Two CpG islands
were located in FBXO32 promoter and exon 1, as
illustrated in Figure 3A. A bisulfite genomic sequencing
assay revealed promoter hypermethylation of FBXO32 in
the TE13, T.Tn, and Yes-2 cell lines (Fig. 3B). The results
were further verified with a BS-MSP assay (Fig. 3C). Full
methylation of the FBXO32 promoter was observed in
TE13, T.Tn, and Yes-2 cells. After treatment with 5-AzadC, demethylation of the FBXO32 promoter was
observed in these cells.

FBXO32-F3) were designed for functional characterization
of the FBXO32 promoter. FBXO32-F3 had the highest
relative luciferase activity, providing a potential explanation
for the importance of proximal promoter methylation of
FBXO32 in the control of FBXO32 transcription (Fig.
3D). In vitro methylation of FBXO32-F3 led to a 90%
decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 3E), providing direct
evidence for the role of methylation in this region.
Decreased Expression and Aberrant Methylation
of FBXO32 in Clinical Specimens

The Student t test was used to compare mRNA expression
between tumor sections and corresponding normal
tissues. FBXO32 mRNA expression in ESCC tumor sections was reduced significantly compared with that in corresponding normal tissues (P 5 .001) (Fig. 4A,B). The
pattern of immunohistochemical staining of FBXO32
was cytoplasmic (Fig. 4C). The chi-square test was used to
compare the protein expression of FBXO32 between tumor sections and corresponding normal tissues. Positive

protein expression of FBXO32 in tumor sections (41 of
123 samples; 31.1%) was significantly lower than that in
corresponding normal tissues (106 of 132 samples; 80.3%;
P 5 .000). FBXO32 protein expression was associated
with TNM stage, depth of invasion, distant metastasis or
recurrence, and UGIC family history (P < .05) (Table 1).
The methylation analysis was performed successfully
in all specimens (Fig. 4D). The chi-square test was used to
compare the methylation frequency between tumor sections and corresponding normal tissues. The methylation
frequency of FBXO32 in tumor tissues (69 of 132 samples; 52.3%) was significantly greater than that in corresponding normal tissues (6 of 132 samples; 4.5%;
P 5 .000). FBXO32 methylation was associated with
TNM stage, pathologic differentiation, depth of invasion,
and distant metastasis or recurrence (P < .05) (Table 1,
Supporting Fig. 4) (see online supporting information).
Association Between FBXO32 Methylation
Status and Expression

FBXO32 mRNA expression in ESCC tumor sections that
had no detectable FBXO32 protein was significantly
reduced compared with ESCC tumor tissues that had detectable FBXO32 protein (P 5 .002). For ESCC tumor
sections in which the promoter of FBXO32 was methylated, FBXO32 mRNA expression was reduced significantly compared with that in ESCC tumor tissues
without methylation of the gene (P 5 .01) (Fig. 4E). The
correlation of FBXO32 methylation status and protein
expression is provided in Table 2: a close correlation was
noted between FBXO32 promoter methylation and loss
of protein expression in the FBXO32 gene in ESCC
(P 5 .005; chi-square test). However, immunohistochemical staining also revealed normal staining of FBXO32 in
14 tumor sections that had FBXO32 methylation.
The Role of FBXO32 Expression in Modulation
of the TGF-b/Smad Signaling Pathway in ESCC

The protein expression of p-Smad2/3 and Smad4 was further examined in esophageal cancer cell lines and tissues.
2420

Figures 1C and 2C reveal decreased Smad4 protein
expression in cancer cell lines and 5-Aza-dC or TSA or
CBP treatment resulted in up-regulation of Smad4. As
shown in Figure 4D, the pattern of immunohistochemical
staining of p-Smad2/3 was nuclear staining, and Smad4
was nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. The chi-square test
was used to compare the protein expression of p-Smad2/3
or Smad4 between tumor sections and corresponding normal tissues. Positive protein expression of p-Smad2/3 and
Smad4 in tumor sections was significantly lower than that
in corresponding normal tissues (P < .01). A positive correlation was noted between FBXO32 and protein expression of p-Smad2/3 and Smad4 (P 5 .000; chi-square test)
(Table 2).
Survival Analysis of FBXO32, p-Smad2/3, and
Smad4 in ESCC

The patients were followed for a minimum of 1.5 years
(range, 1.5-6.5 years); and, for survivors, the median
follow-up was 5.5 years. The Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated in Figure 5 indicate that FBXO32 methylation was
inversely correlated with the survival of patients with
ESCC; whereas FBXO32, p-Smad2/3, and Smad4
expression was positively correlated with survival in
patients with ESCC (P < .05; log-rank test). For the
patients with ESCC who had tumors with methylated
FBXO32, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 23%
(median survival, 33 months; P 5 .001; log-rank test);
whereas, for those with ESCC who had unmethylated
FBXO32, the 5-year survival rate was 46% (median survival, not reached). For patients who had FBXO32expressing ESCC tumors, the 5-year survival rate was
44% (median survival, not reached); and, for those who
had FBXO32-negative ESCC tumors, the 5-year survival
rate was 20% (median survival, 31 months; P 5 .001; logrank test) (Supporting Table 3) (see online supporting information). Patients with ESCC who had stage III and IV
disease, negative expression of FBXO32, and hypermethylation of FBXO32 were most likely to develop metastatic
disease and also had the worse survival. Cox multivariate

analysis demonstrated that FBXO32 methylation status,
protein expression, TNM stage, and UGIC family history
were independently associated with survival in patients
with ESCC (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
FBXO32 protein, as a member of the muscle-specific Fbox protein family, is highly expressed during muscle atrophy.20 To date, several studies have linked this gene
with cancer. FBXO32 was identified as a TGF-b/Smad
target gene and was transcriptionally silenced by promoter
hypermethylation in breast cancer cells and ovarian cancer
cell lines; in addition, the methylation status of FBXO32
may predict survival in ovarian cancer.8-10 However, the
effect of FBXO32 in ESCC has not been previously
reported. The current results suggest that aberrant methylation of FBXO32 and histone deacetylation may suppress the expression of FBXO32 mRNA and protein in
esophageal cancer cells and further verify that histone H3
Lys-9 methylation, histone H3 Lys-9 acetylation, and H3
Lys-4 methylation are correlated or inversely correlated
with FBXO32 expression. These findings are consistent
with the proposed hypothesis that combinations of histone modifications at different residues act synergistically
or antagonistically to affect gene expression.21 Recent
findings suggest that FBXO32 is a novel apoptosis regulator and is negatively regulated by a prosurvival signal.7,8
The current findings that CBP treatment results in the
up-regulation of FBXO32 in TE13 and TE1 cells and in a
significant down-regulation of Survivin and up-regulation
of Bax in FBXO32 stably transfected TE13 cells further
confirms that FBXO32 may act as an apoptosis regulator
in esophageal cancer.
Recent studies have demonstrated that disruption of
an upstream signaling pathway regulator may result in
transcriptional repression of a downstream target gene
2422

through epigenetic mechanisms.22,23 It has been reported
that dysregulation of TGF-b/Smad4 signaling leads to
epigenetic silencing of its downstream targets, ADAM19
and RunX1T1, in ovarian cancer cells with impaired
SMAD4 nuclear translocation.23,24 FBXO32 has been
identified as a TGF-b/Smad target gene using the ChIPChip method, and dysregulation of TGF-b/Smad4 signaling may lead to aberrant DNA methylation of
FBXO32 in ovarian cancer.9,10 Our current investigation
of FBXO32 further supports this hypothesis. We observed
decreased expression of FBXO32, p-Smad2/3, and
Smad4 and a positive correlation between FBXO32 and
p-Smad2/3, Smad4 expression in ESCC. In addition, we
observed protein expression of Smad4 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, mainly in the nucleus in normal
tissues and mainly in the cytoplasm in tumor samples,
indicating the blocking of Smad4 nuclear translocation in
ESCC. It is well accepted that nuclear proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and need to be imported through
the nuclear pore complexes into the nucleus.9 The effect
of Smad4 nuclear translocation may have an important
role in regulating target gene expression. Further investigations are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms and
molecules that regulate the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of Smad4. Furthermore, the finding that 5-Aza-dC
or TSA treatment can lead to the up-regulation of Smad4
suggests that decreased expression of Smad4 in ESCC
may be caused in part by epigenetic mechanisms, as we
observed in our previous study.4
We also observed a close correlation between
FBXO32 promoter methylation and the loss of mRNA
and protein expression of the gene in ESCC; however, immunohistochemical staining also produced positive staining for FBXO32 in some tumor samples that had
FBXO32 methylation. Gene heterogenic methylation or
an allele methylation may be an important reason. It has

been demonstrated that DNA methylation, which suppresses gene expression mainly at transcriptional level,
and the density of methylated CpG Island are related to
the suppressed degree of transcription.25 The observation
that tumor tissues with both positive protein expression
and hypermethylation of the gene had incomplete
FBXO32 methylation indicates that the extent of promoter methylation of FBXO32 in these tumors was insufficient to suppress transcription of the gene. Some tumor
tissues without methylation of FBXO32 demonstrated
negative protein expression of the gene, indicating that
the mechanisms of FBXO32 inactivation in ESCC can be
attributed to several factors other than methylation.
In the current study, FBXO32 hypermethylation
and the expression of FBXO32, p-Smad2/3, and Smad4
were correlated significantly and directly with survival in
patients with ESCC. In multivariate analysis, the combination of tumor stage, FBXO32, methylation, and
FBXO32 expression provided independent, predictive information about ESCC metastasis and poor survival.
Patients with hypermethylation and down-expression of
FBXO32 who had stage III and IV disease and a positive
UGIC family history had the worst 5-year OS rate. Thus,
FBXO32 may have the potential to serve as a useful new
prognostic marker for ESCC.
In conclusion, the current results suggest that
FBXO32 is epigenetically silenced in ESCC tumors with
impaired TGF-b/Smad signaling and that FBXO32 promoter hypermethylation may be 1 of the mechanisms for
inactivation of FBXO32 in ESCC. FBXO32 may be a
functional tumor suppressor and may serve as a prognostic
methylation biomarker for ESCC.
