ABSTRACT
Maternal nutrition is important for the risk of the offspring to develop insulin
resistance and adiposity later in life. The study was undertaken to determine effects
of maternal butyrate supplementation on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in
the offspring skeletal muscle. The offspring of rats, fed a control diet or a butyrate diet
(1% sodium butyrate) throughout gestation and lactation, was studied at weaning
and at 60 days of age. The offspring of dams fed a butyrate diet had higher HOMAinsulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. This was associated with elevated
mRNA and protein expressions of lipogenic genes and decreased amounts of lipolytic
enzyme. Simultaneously, enhanced acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 and histone H3
lysine 27 modification on the lipogenic genes in skeletal muscle of adult offspring
was observed. Higher concentration of serum insulin and intramuscular triglyceride
in skeletal muscle of offspring from the butyrate group at weaning were accompanied
by increasing levels of lipogenic genes and enrichment of acetylation of histone H3
lysine 27. Maternal butyrate supplementation leads to insulin resistance and ectopic
lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle of offspring, indicating the importance of short
chain fatty acids in the maternal diet on lipid metabolism.

on short chain fatty acids (SCFA) [8]. Butyrate is a SCFA
which is produced in the gastrointestinal tract [9], and
acts as an energy source to meet energy requirements in
ruminants and monogastric animals [10, 11]. Besides,
butyrate acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor
which can inhibit deacetylation of histone and various
transcription factors, involved in several biological
pathways associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes [12,
13]. In vivo, several studies have shown that butyrate can
alleviate high fat diet-induced obesity and improve insulin
sensitivity in skeletal muscle of mice under a high fat diet
[14, 15]. However, a previous study suggested maternal
high fiber diet, which could produce butyrate by microbial
fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract, increased the
expressions of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
related to adipogenesis [16]. Additionally, Radunz et al.
[17] found that progeny from dams fed high fiber diet had
increased intramuscular fat deposition and diminished

INTRODUCTION
Maternal nutrition during gestation and lactation
has profound effects on fetal growth and development
with lifelong consequences [1, 2]. Animal models confirm
that maternal diet influences the development of insulin
resistance and adiposity in the offspring [3, 4]. Insulin
resistance is a well-recognized factor in the development
and progression of a series of disorders including
type II diabetes and hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
cardiovascular disease [5]. It has also been shown that
nutritional factors during offspring early life possibly
influence permanently the risk of an individual to develop
insulin resistance in adulthood [6, 7].
Maternal dietary fatty acids not only are important
as an energy source but also play important role in
regulation of gene expression in cells and in intercellular
communication in offspring [1, 8]. Currently, most studies
focus on the effects of long-chain fatty acids rather than

insulin response. In vitro, butyrate was found to stimulate
adipogenesis and triglyceride storage [18, 19]. Whether
maternal butyrate supplementation could have effects on
lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in the offspring
skeletal muscle has never been shown.
The ectopic accumulation of lipids in skeletal
muscle has been viewed as a major factor in the etiology
of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes by reducing
insulin stimulated glucose uptake [20–23]. During the
past two decades, increasing emphasis was placed on
understanding the connection between intramuscular
triacylglycerol content and insulin action. Interest in
this topic grew from numerous reports showing a strong
negative association between intramuscular triacylglycerol
content and insulin sensitivity [24, 25]. This relationship
was also evident in obese and diabetic humans as well
as in several rodent and cell culture models of metabolic
disease and/or chronic lipid exposure [26–28]. However,
the mechanism, how maternal butyrate supplementation
influences the relationship between lipid metabolism and
insulin sensitivity, is largely unclear.
In the present study, we used the maternal sodium
butyrate supplement during pregnancy and lactation in
rat as a model to investigate the offspring skeletal muscle
lipid deposition and possible consequences for the insulin
sensitivity. The results will further contribute to clarify
the effect of maternal short chain fatty acids on offspring
metabolism.

enhanced in the butyrate group compared with control
(Table 1), though both of them showed no obvious
differences at weaning age.

Impaired insulin sensitivity in offspring of
butyrate supplemented rats
Serum concentrations of insulin and NEFA were
increased (P < 0.05) at weaning in offspring of butyrate
supplemented rats (Table 2). This difference was not
observed in adult offspring. However, concentration of
fasting glucose was higher (P < 0.05) in the butyrate
group (Table 2). When adult offspring were challenged
with a GTT and an ITT, butyrate group rats showed
permanently increased serum glucose levels (Figure
1a, 1b), indicating decreased responsiveness as a sign
for development of insulin resistance. Furthermore,
HOMA-IR (HOMA-insulin resistance) was significantly
increased in both weaning offspring (P < 0.01) and adult
offspring (P < 0.05) belonging to the butyrate group
(Table 2).

Maternal butyrate inhibited protein expressions
related to the insulin signaling and glucose
uptake n skeletal muscle from adult offspring
Because of the whole body insulin resistance
observed in the adult offspring, we examined components
of the insulin-signaling pathway in these animals.
Phosphorylation of IRS at ser1101 was increased (P <
0.05) and the abundances of total PI3K/P85 (P < 0.05)
and total AKT protein (P = 0.07) were reduced in skeletal
muscle of the butyrate group (Figure 2). With the higher
concentration of fasting glucose in adult rats, GLUT 4
related to glucose uptake in skeletal muscle was decreased
(P < 0.05) in the butyrate group (Figure 2).

RESULTS
Maternal butyrate increased offspring body and
muscle weight

Maternal butyrate increased intramuscular
triglyceride content of offspring

enhanced (P < 0.05) in gastrocnemius muscle of female
rats in the butyrate group. Among the genes involved in
lipolysis, PNPLA2 and HSL mRNA expression did not
change (Figure 4a) whereas the ATGL protein level (P
< 0.05) and the phosphorylation level of HSL (P < 0.05)
decreased (Figure 4b). FAS mRNA (Figure 4a) and protein
expression (Figure 4b) in adult rats showed no obvious
changes between two groups.

Serum total cholesterol and total triglyceride were
not affected in the offspring at weaning by butyrate
supplementation of the dams (P > 0.05). However,
significantly higher (P < 0.05) content of intramuscular
triglyceride was observed in the butyrate group at weaning
(Table 2).
Later in life, total cholesterol and triglyceride in
serum were also not different between the butyrate group
and the control group, while the content of intramuscular
triglyceride further increased significantly (P < 0.05) in
the butyrate group (Table 2). Oil-red O staining revealed
the abundance of intramuscular adipocytes in muscle cross
sections of butyrate group rats but not in that of controls
(Supplementary Figure 1).

Histone modifications on the promoter of lipid
metabolism related genes
In the gastrocnemius muscle of weaning offspring,
higher enrichment (P < 0.05) of acH3K27 was found for
PPARγ and a trend for higher enrichment (P = 0.07) for C/
EBPβ in the butyrate group. Histone modification on the
promoter of the FAS gene was not influenced by maternal
butyrate supplementation (Figure 5a).
Furthermore, in the gastrocnemius muscle of
adult offspring, maternal butyrate supplementation
during gestation and lactation significantly enhanced the
enrichment of acH3K9 and acH3K27 on the promoters of
C/EBPβ (P < 0.05) and FAS (P < 0.05) (Figure 5b, 5c).
Furthermore, we observed enrichment of acH3K27 on the
promoter of PPARγ (Figure 5c).

mRNA and protein abundance of lipid
metabolism related genes in gastrocnemius
muscle
Among these lipid related genes, PPARγ mRNA
expression was higher (P < 0.05) in skeletal muscle of
weaning rats in the butyrate group, which was consistent
with a significant up-regulation of PPARγ protein
expression (P < 0.05). Although C/EBPβ and FAS mRNA
expressions in weaning rats were not altered, their protein
levels were higher (P < 0.05) in the butyrate group. On the
other hand, PNPLA2 (ATGL) mRNA expression related
to lipolysis was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) (Figure
3a) while its protein level was still higher (P < 0.05) in
weaning rats of the butyrate group (Figure 3b).
During the offspring adult life, lipid related
transcription factors including PPARγ and C/EBPβ mRNA
(Figure 4a) and protein abundances (Figure 4b) were

DISCUSSION
The current study highlights the importance of
maternal nutrition for the offspring phenotype. It is the
first to indicate that maternal butyrate supplementation
during gestation and lactation induces insulin resistance
in adult female offspring. The results show that insulin
resistance could be induced by the accumulation of TG
in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the mechanisms involved
in mediating the effects of maternal butyrate on the

intramuscular fat deposition include increasing lipogenic
and reducing lipolysis genes in offspring skeletal muscle
partly via enhanced histone acetylation modification.
Maternal nutrition can influence the physiology and
metabolism of the offspring such as insulin sensitivity
[30, 31]. Prior studies have shown that offspring from
dams fed high fiber diet, which could produce butyrate
by microbial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract, had
diminished insulin response [17]. In the present study, the
adult offspring that were born to dams on butyrate diet had
higher serum glucose, HOMA-IR and impaired glucose
tolerance, suggesting that they were developing insulin
resistance.
Skeletal muscle is a primary site of glucose
disposal and insulin action [32]. Many insulin responses
are activated through the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway [33,
34]. The increased Ser1101-IRS1 phosphorylation and
decreased PI3K p85α subunit and AKT showed that the
insulin signaling was impaired in skeletal muscle from
adult offspring in butyrate group. Increased Ser1101
phosphorylation of IRS1 has been shown to inhibit IRS1
function and could be a specific target of PKCθ [35].
The PKCθ promotes IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and

impaired downstream insulin signaling [20, 35]. A higher
protein expression of PKCθ was observed in skeletal
muscle of adult offspring of the butyrate group in our
research. Glucose uptake could be prevented by inhibiting
the PI3K/Akt pathway [34]. Previous studies showed
that maternal obesity during the periconceptional period
resulted in lower GLUT4 protein abundance in skeletal
muscle in female lambs [36]. We found maternal butyrate
supplementation inhibited the protein expression of PI3K/
p85 and GLUT4 in skeletal muscle in adult offspring. Our
data indicate for the first that maternal butyrate diet can
induce whole-body insulin resistance and inhibits insulin
signaling pathway and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle
in adult offspring.
Several studies have shown that a high fat diet with
butyrate supplementation could alleviate obesity and
improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle of mice
[14, 15]. However, in the present study, we observed that
maternal normal diet with butyrate supplementation has
increased the levels of intramuscular triglycerides in both
weaning and adult offspring skeletal muscle. In addition,
our previous study demonstrated maternal butyrate
supplementation led to lipid accumulation in offspring

liver of weaning-age rats [37]. These differences suggest
that maternal normal diets with butyrate supplementation
induced the onset of intramuscular triglyceride deposition
in offspring at early age, indicating the importance of
maternal nutrition environment.
Furthermore, in porcine stromal-vascular cells,
butyrate was found to stimulate adipocyte differentiation
and stimulation of triglyceride storage [18, 19]. In addition
to lipid accumulation within myocytes, adipocytes
developed in close proximity to myocytes, induced
by upregulation of key regulating transcription factors
like PPARγ and C/EBPβ [38–42]. Thus, to illustrate
intramuscular triglyceride deposition, in our present
study the increased expressions of C/EBPβ and PPARγ
were found. Similarly, butyrate was reported to increase
lipid accumulation including increasing the levels
of transcriptional factors like C/EBPs and PPARγ in
preadipocytes [18, 43].
Given the fact that ATGL and HSL are responsible
for more than 95% of the TAG hydrolase activity
[44], reduced ATGL and HSL may contribute to
accumulation of intramuscular triglycerides and insulin
resistance. In the present study, at adulthood, HSL
phosphorylation and ATGL were dramatically reduced

in the skeletal muscle of the butyrate group. At weaning
age, ATGL protein expression was up-regulated and HSL
phosphorylation tended to decrease with maternal butyrate
supplementation. Previous studies have also shown that
up-regulation of ATGL expression and/or inhibition of
HSL activity promoted diacylglycerols accumulation in
skeletal muscle and impaired insulin signaling [23, 45].
Taken together, the data suggests that maternal butyrate
supplementation induced accumulation of intramuscular
triglycerides in offspring skeletal muscle may be caused
at least in part by a reduced expression of HSL and ATGL.
As shown before, butyrate has HDAC inhibitory
activity [46–48]. The activation of histone acetylation
could increase the transcriptional regulation of lipogenetic
and metabolic genes. Previously, it has been reported that
acH3K9 and acH3K27 could be activated by butyrate and
enhance gene transcription [47, 48, 49]. In the previous
studies, treatment of sodium butyrate accelerated
adipogenesis and increased lipid accumulation by the
hyperacetylation at the promoter regions of adipogenic
genes such as PPARγ and C/EBP [43, 50]. In the present
study, ChIP results indicated that butyrate increased the
amount of acH3K9 at the promoter of C/EBPβ and the
amount of acH3K27 at the promoter of PPARγ and C/

rats. Follow-up studies in vitro are needed to identify the
possible pathway in offspring after the maternal butyrate
supplementation.
In conclusion, we are the first to demonstrate that
a maternal butyrate diet during gestation and lactation
leads to insulin resistance and accumulation of ectopic
lipids in skeletal muscle of female offspring. This is
associated with reductions in protein levels of key insulin
signaling molecules and increase in protein expressions
of molecules involved in lipid accumulation in skeletal

EBPβ. These results support the possibility that butyrate
stimulates lipogenesis in offspring skeletal muscle, in part
through acetylation at the promoter regions of adipogenic
genes. In this study, up-regulation of PPARγ gene was
positive association with higher enrichment of acH3K27
on the promoter, in the skeletal muscle of butyrate group
rats at weaning. Therefore, the increased amount of histone
acetylation in the current research appears to play a role in
the transcriptional regulation of lipogenic gene expression
in skeletal muscle of offspring of butyrate supplemented

on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Serum concentration of glucose, total cholesterol,
total triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol (HDL - C), LDLcholesterol (LDL - C) and non-esterified fatty acid
(NEFA) were measured by biochemical automatic analyzer
(Hitachi 7020, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) using commercial
assay kits (KH674, KQ436, AM545, KP712 and KF253,
respectively; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Wako;

(Intramuscular Triglyceride) was measured using a tissue
total triglyceride assay kit (E1013; Applygen Technologies,
Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Butyrate levels in the serum of the dams were
published in our previous study (32.9 ± 2.9 μM vs
63.7 ± 12.3 μM; P < 0.05). It could be detected by gas
chromatographic analysis. The extraction and gas
chromatographic analysis procedure was carried out as
described by Zhao et al. [29] with some modifications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental design and sampling
Twenty-eight virgin female Sprague Dawley
rats were purchased from Laboratory Animal Centre,
university of Jiangsu and housed in individual cages
under temperature- and humidity controlled conditions
with a 12-h light/dark cycle. After 7 d of acclimatization,
rats were mated, and conception was confirmed by the
presence of spermatozoids in the vaginal wash. Pregnant
rats were randomly assigned to either control or butyrate
diet (1% butyrate sodium), with water ad libitum. The
control diet was prepared following the recommendations
of the American Institute of Nutrition for rodent growth
(AIN-93G) (Table 3).
After delivering, litters were adjusted to eight
animals for each dam, maintaining the sex ratio as close
as possible to 1:1. During lactation, dams continued to
consume their assigned experimental diet. Eight female
offspring of either group were randomly selected and
killed at 21 days of age (weaning). Further 8 animals per
group were fed with the same control diet and killed at 60
days of age. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital
sodium and sacrificed by bleeding. A blood sample was
collected, the gastrocnemius muscles were excised,
weighed, immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C until analysis.
All animal procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
of Nanjing Agricultural University. The protocol of this
study was reviewed and approved with the project number
2012CB124703. The slaughter and sampling procedures
strictly followed the “Guidelines on Ethical Treatment
of Experimental Animals” (2006) No. 398 set out by
the Ministry of Science and Technology, China and the
Regulation regarding the Management and Treatment
of Experimental Animals” (2008) No. 45 set out by the
Jiangsu Provincial People’s Government.

Metabolic assays
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) (n= 10
in controls; n = 12 in butyrate group) and insulin tolerance
test (ITT) (n = 5 per group) were performed in overnight
fasted rats. Blood samples were obtained from the tail tip
at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 min for GTT. For ITT, blood
samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 min. Glucose
levels were measured using a glucometer (AccuCheck
II; Roche, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). The doses used
during these tests were 1.5 g/kg body weight and 0.5 U/kg
body weight for GTT and ITT, respectively.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR for mRNA
quantification
Total RNA was isolated from gastrocnemius muscles
(n = 8 per group) with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, USA) and reverse transcribed with the
PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (RR048A,
Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Diluted cDNA (2 µl, 1:25) was used in each
real-time PCR assay with Mx3000P (Stratagene, Agilent
Technologies, USA and CA). All primers (Table 4 and 5)

For normalization, β-actin was chosen as a reference gene
and was not affected by the experimental factors.

All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. The
statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) software 18.0 for
Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The 2-ΔΔCt
method was applied to analyze real-time PCR data.
The differences were tested with analysis of variance
(ANOVA), and a t-test was used for the independent
samples. Differences were considered significant at
P < 0.05.

Protein extraction and Western blotting analysis
Total cellular protein was extracted from 100 mg of
frozen gastrocnemius muscle (n = 6 per group) samples
as described previously [29]. Protein concentrations were
measured with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (no. 23225,
Thermo Scientific). Western blot analysis of target proteins
was carried out according to the protocols provided by the
manufacturer. The sources of primary antibodies used

We would like to acknowledge the Priority
Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher
Education Institutions. This study was supported by the
National Natural Science Foundation of China (31572482)
and the National Key Research and Development Program
of China (2016YFD0500502).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Approximately 200 mg of frozen gastrocnemius
muscle samples (n = 5 or 6 per group) were ground in
liquid N2 and washed with PBS containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (no. 11697498001; Roche; Castle
Hill, NSW, Australia). Cross-linking of protein and
DNA was performed by adding formaldehyde to a final
concentration of 1 %, and then the reaction was stopped
with glycine (2.5 mol/l) at room temperature. The reaction
mixture was centrifuged and the pellets were washed with
PBS and lysed in a SDS lysis buffer. Chromatin was
sonicated to an average length ranging from 200 to 500
bp and precleared with protein G agarose beads treated
with salmon sperm DNA (40 μl, 50 % slurry, sc-2003;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The mixture of chromatin
preparations and 2 μg of specific primary antibody were
incubated overnight at 4°C. A negative control was
included with normal rat IgG. Protein G agarose beads
(40 μl, 50 % slurry, sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
were added to capture the immunoprecipitated chromatin
complexes. Finally, reverse cross-linking was performed
to release DNA fragments from the immunoprecipitated
complex at 65°C for 1 h, and quantitative real-time
PCR was used to quantify the fragments of target gene
promoters with specific primers (Table 5) using purified
immunoprecipitated DNA as the template.
