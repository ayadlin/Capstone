ABSTRACT
Microtubule-binding drugs such as taxol are frontline treatments for a variety
of cancers but exactly how they yield patient benefit is unclear. In cell culture,
inhibiting microtubule dynamics prevents spindle assembly, leading to mitotic
arrest followed by either apoptosis in mitosis or slippage, whereby a cell returns
to interphase without dividing. Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1), a pro-survival
member of the Bcl-2 family central to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, is degraded
during a prolonged mitotic arrest and may therefore act as a mitotic death timer.
Consistently, we show that blocking proteasome-mediated degradation inhibits
taxol-induced mitotic apoptosis in a Mcl-1-dependent manner. However, this
degradation does not require the activity of either APC/C-Cdc20, FBW7 or MULE,
three separate E3 ubiquitin ligases implicated in targeting Mcl-1 for degradation.
This therefore challenges the notion that Mcl-1 undergoes regulated degradation
during mitosis. We also show that Mcl-1 is continuously synthesized during
mitosis and that blocking protein synthesis accelerates taxol induced death-inmitosis. Modulating Mcl-1 levels also influences slippage; overexpressing Mcl-1
extends the time from mitotic entry to mitotic exit in the presence of taxol, while
inhibiting Mcl-1 accelerates it. We suggest that Mcl-1 competes with Cyclin B1 for
binding to components of the proteolysis machinery, thereby slowing down the
slow degradation of Cyclin B1 responsible for slippage. Thus, modulating Mcl-1
dynamics influences both death-in-mitosis and slippage. However, because mitotic
degradation of Mcl-1 appears not to be under the control of an E3 ligase, we suggest
that the notion of network crosstalk is used with caution.

(SAC) leading to a prolonged mitotic arrest [6-8]. After a
protracted mitosis, cells either undergo death in mitosis
(DiM), or exit without completing cell division and
return to interphase, a process known as slippage [9-11].
Following slippage, post-mitotic responses then induce
cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis [12]. In response
to agents that perturb mitosis, failure to undergo DiM
and/or failure to efficiently engage post-mitotic responses
can lead to proliferation of cells with highly abnormal
genomes [13, 14].
Whether a cell dies in mitosis or undergoes slippage
is best explained by the competing-networks model [10].
This model posits that mitotic fate is dictated by two
independent networks, one slowly generating a death

INTRODUCTION
Microtubule binding agents are used extensively
to treat ovarian, breast, prostate and lung cancer, as
well as various leukemias [1]. While these drugs have
impressive clinical efficacy, exactly how they yield patient
benefit is unclear [2, 3]. This is in part because inhibiting
microtubule dynamics impacts multiple aspects of tumor
biology [4, 5]. Interfering with microtubules becomes
particularly acute during mitosis when the interphase
microtubule array is disassembled in order to construct the
spindle apparatus responsible for chromosome segregation
and cell division [1]. Disrupting spindle assembly results
in persistent activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint

signal, the other slowly degrading Cyclin B1, leading
to slippage. During a protracted arrest, Cyclin B1 levels
slowly fall due to incomplete penetrance of the SAC [9].
Meanwhile, a poorly defined cell death signal becomes
stronger [15]. Both networks contain thresholds and the
fate of the cell is dictated by which threshold is breached
first. Our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for
Cyclin B1 degradation are well advanced [16]. However,
much less is known about how apoptosis is regulated
during a mitotic arrest.
Death in mitosis involves the intrinsic apoptosis
pathway, with multiple members of the Bcl-2 family
subject to regulation by mitosis-specific controls [17].
For example, the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein Bim
is ubiquitinated by the anaphase promoting complex
(APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that also targets Cyclin B1
for degradation [18]. Bid, another BH3-only pro-apoptotic
protein, is phosphorylated by Cdk1 [19]. Pro-survival BclxL is also phosphorylated by Cdk1, weakening its ability
to bind and inhibit pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak [20,
21]. Mcl-1 is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated in mitosis,
and several protein kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases have
been implicated. Cdk1 phosphorylates Mcl-1 on serine 64
and threonine 92, and when expressed in U2OS cells, Mcl1 T92A resists degradation and suppresses nocodazoleinduced apoptosis [22, 23]. Mcl-1 binds the APC/C cofactor Cdc20 and has a putative D-box, an RXXL motif
required for co-factor binding. Mutating the RXXL
motif or inhibiting APC/C-Cdc20, either by depletion
of Cdc20 or the APC subunit APC3, stabilizes Mcl-1 in
mitotic-arrested U2OS cells [22]. These observations
suggest a simple model whereby Mcl-1 is targeted for
degradation during a mitotic arrest by Cdk1-dependent
APC/C-Cdc20 ubiquitination. However, other mechanisms
are also implicated. In interphase, Mcl-1 is targeted for
degradation by FBW7, an F-box adapter involved in
SCF-mediated ubiquitination [24, 25]. Inhibiting FBW7
also stabilizes Mcl-1 in mitosis and enhances slippage
[26]. The E3 ligase first shown to be involved in Mcl1 ubiquitination was MULE/HUWE1 [27]. Inhibiting
MULE also stabilizes Mcl-1 in mitotic-arrested cells [28,
29]. Reconciling these different observations is difficult
but may reflect redundancy, cell line variation and/or ‘belt
and braces’ protection to ensure that an overly protracted
mitosis sensitizes cells to undergo apoptosis [17].
Despite these complexities, because Mcl-1 is
degraded during a mitotic arrest, it could act as the death
timer evoked by the competing-networks model [10, 30,
31]. In its original formulation, the competing-networks
model suggested that the two networks are independent
[10]. Observations indicating that Mcl-1 interacts with
both apoptotic and mitotic regulators, raises the possibility
that there may however be crosstalk between the networks
that define mitotic cell fate. To test this possibility, we
analyzed the effect of Mcl-1 degradation on both death in
mitosis and slippage.

Mcl-1 is synthesized and degraded in mitosis
RNAi-mediated inhibition of Mcl-1 can accelerate
death in mitosis (DiM), at least in some cell lines [29,
32]. In addition, Mcl-1 is degraded during a mitotic arrest
[22]. This suggests that Mcl-1 degradation acts as a death
in mitosis timer. If this is the case, then blocking Mcl-1
degradation should delay DiM. To test this, we turned to
RKO cells, a colon cancer line that typically undergoes
DiM and rarely slips [10]. Consistent with previous
reports, Mcl-1 levels fell when RKO cells were arrested in
mitosis with taxol (Fig. S1A). Moreover, upon exposing
taxol-arrested RKO cells to the proteasome inhibitor
MG132, Mcl-1 levels increased (Fig. S1B). This indicates
that not only is Mcl-1 degraded in mitosis, but that it
is also synthesized during the arrest. Indeed, blocking
protein synthesis with cycloheximide led to a rapid decline
in Mcl-1 levels (Fig. S1C).
Next, we set out to determine whether blocking
Mcl-1 degradation with MG132 delayed death in
mitosis. However, because MG132 also blocks the slow
degradation of Cyclin B1 it abolishes slippage which
complicates interpretation of the results [9]. Therefore to
focus on Mcl-1’s role in DiM, we created experimental
conditions whereby slippage was prevented by expression
of a stabilized version Cyclin B1, namely the R42A
mutant [33]. Combining taxol with tet-induction of
Cyclin B1 R42A completely blocked slippage: every cell
we analyzed by time-lapse imaging underwent death in
mitosis (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1D)
Addition of MG132 to taxol-treated Cyclin B1
R42A cells had a profound effect. Whereas control cells
died after an average of 10.2 hours, MG132-treated cells
took on average 31.2 hours to commit to DiM (Fig. 1B,
left panel, Fig. S1E, S1F). To determine whether Mcl-1
was required for this prolonged survival, we used RNAi to
inhibit Mcl-1. As an additional control we also performed
Bcl-xL RNAi. Depletion of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL levels
accelerated DiM with cells taking on average 3.5 and 6.4
hours, respectively. Strikingly, Mcl-1 RNAi completely
reversed the effect of MG132. By contrast, Bcl-xL RNAi
had little effect. Thus, the simplest explanation for these
observations is that the prolonged death delay induced by
MG132 is due to inhibition of Mcl-1 degradation.
Consistent with continued synthesis of Mcl-1
maintaining survival during a mitotic arrest, addition of
cycloheximide accelerated DiM (Fig. 1B, right panel).
Interestingly, 26% of the cycloheximide-treated cells
avoided DiM by undergoing slippage. Note that in the
absence of taxol, the mitotic arrest induced by Cyclin
B1 R42A is not fully penetrant (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1G); we
therefore suspect that enhanced slippage in this case is
caused by cycloheximide reducing mitotic synthesis of
Cyclin B1, thereby accelerating Cyclin B1’s decline even

Analysis of Mcl-1’s putative D-box

though DiM is also accelerated [34]. Taken together, these
observations support the notion that Mcl-1 is a key mitosis
survival factor and that degradation of Mcl-1 defines time
to death during a protracted mitotic arrest.

Because inhibiting APC/C-Cdc20 and FBW7 had
little effect on either Mcl-1 degradation or time to death,
we turned to a more direct approach, namely mutating
potential degrons in Mcl-1. In particular, we focused
on a potential D-box. Note that D-boxes contain RXXL
motifs and are typically found in APC/C-Cdc20 substrates
[16]. Importantly, mutating an RXXL motif in Mcl-1 was
previously shown to suppress its degradation in mitosis
[22]. We therefore generated tet-inducible RKO cells
expressing GFP-tagged wild type Mcl-1 and a mutant,
Mcl-1RALA, where arginine 207 and leucine 210 in the
RXXL motif are mutated to alanine (Fig. 3A). Consistent
with Mcl-1’s pro-survival effect, tet-induction of the wild
type protein delayed time to death in taxol from 13.1 hours
to 18.4 hours (Fig. 3B). If the Mcl-1RALA mutant resisted
mitotic degradation, then we expected that it might have
a more penetrant effect on DiM. However, while Mcl1RALA also extended time to death in taxol, the effect was
comparable to the wild type (Fig. 3B).
Immunoblotting suggested that the ectopic Mcl1 proteins were expressed at similar levels to the
endogenous (Fig. 3A). We therefore asked whether forced
overexpression might reveal a difference between the wild
type and the Mcl-1RALA mutant. Moreover, we wanted to
test the Mcl-1RALA mutant in cells expressing Cyclin B1
R42A. Therefore, we used transient transfections of RKO
cells to force overexpression. Also, rather than expressing
full length Mcl-1, we expressed a 90 amino acid fragment
(a.a. 157-246) encompassing the putative D-box. We
reasoned that if this fragment could compete with the
endogenous protein for APC/C-Cdc20 binding, this might
delay degradation of endogenous Mcl-1 and thus delay
DiM. By contrast, if the RALA mutant was deficient for
APC/C-Cdc20 binding, then it should have no effect on
DiM. Note that this approach is conceptually similar to
the experiment that laid the foundation for the discovery
of Securin whereby addition of a fragment of Cyclin B1
containing the D-box to Xenopus egg extracts competed
endogenous Cyclin and Securin away from APC/C-Cdc20,
thereby inhibiting mitotic exit and anaphase onset [39].
To test this, RKO Cyclin B1 R42A cells were transiently
transfected with constructs expressing mCherry-tagged
Mcl-1 fragments, treated with taxol and cells entering
mitosis were analyzed by time-lapse microscopy. Analysis
of the cumulative death frequency in control cells or
those transfected with mCherry alone showed that the
time taken for 50% of the cells to undergo DiM (i.e. the
T50) was 14.2 hours (Fig. 3C). Overexpressing the Mcl-1
fragment extended the T50 to 19.3 hours. Strikingly, this
was reversed by mutating the RXXL motif; analysis of
the RALA fragment showed that the T50 was reduced
to 11.5 hours. One explanation for these observations
is that endogenous Mcl-1 interacts with APC/C-Cdc20
and that overexpressing the D-box fragment, but not the

Analysis of E3 ligases implicated in mitotic
degradation of Mcl-1
Multiple E3 ligases are implicated in targeting
Mcl-1 for degradation, including the APC/C-Cdc20
[35]. Because the APC/C-Cdc20 is responsible for slow
degradation of Cyclin B1 during a prolonged mitotic
arrest, it is a good candidate for mitotic degradation of
Mcl-1. If this is the case, then blocking APC/C-Cdc20
should delay time to DiM in taxol-treated Cyclin B1 R42A
cells. To test this we treated cells with two APC/C-Cdc20
inhibitors, namely pro-TAME and Apcin (Fig. S2) [36,
37]. In the absence of taxol and Cyclin B1 R42A, proTAME blocked mitotic progression (Fig. 2A), consistent
with APC/C-Cdc20 inhibition. In isolation, Apcin had
little effect but enforced the pro-TAME-mediated block,
resulting in 78% of the population undergoing DiM.
Importantly, this effect was not due to SAC activation as
a consequence of cohesion fatigue [38] because the Mps1
inhibitor AZ3146 did not override the pro-TAME/Apcininduced arrest (Fig. 2B).
Having established that combining pro-TAME
and Apcin efficiently blocks APC/C-Cdc20 activity in
RKO cells, we asked whether this would delay time to
death in taxol-treated Cyclin B1 R42A cells. However,
when we analyzed the cumulative death frequency, there
was no difference between cells treated with or without
the pro-TAME/Apcin combination (Fig. 2C). As DiM
kinetics in this cell line are responsive to modulation of
Mcl-1 levels, this suggests that while the APC/C-Cdc20
may contribute to Mcl-1 degradation during mitosis, it
is not essential. Consistently, in contrast to MG132, the
pro-TAME/Apcin combination did not stabilize Mcl1 levels in mitosis (Fig. 2D). We therefore turned to
another E3 ligase implicated in Mcl-1 degradation, the
SCF complex. Inhibition of the SCF subunit FBW7 by
RNAi, either alone or in combination with proTAME/
Apcin, had no significant effect on Mcl-1 levels or the
time to death in taxol-treated Cyclin B1 R42A cells
(Fig. 2E, 2F). Moreover, RNAi-mediated inhibition
of MULE, either alone or in combination with FBW7
RNAi and/or proTAME/Apcin, had no significant effect
on DiM (Fig. S3). Thus, in the context of this model
system, we do not have any compelling evidence linking
mitotic Mcl-1 degradation to APC/C-Cdc20, FBW7 and
MULE. This could suggest that the modalities used here
are simply not penetrant enough to have a significant
inhibitory effect on Mcl-1 degradation. Alternatively,
it could be that other mechanisms contribute to Mcl1 degradation even when APC/C-Cdc20, FBW7 and
MULE are inhibited.

Consistently, expression of the D-box fragment, but not

Taken together, these observations suggest that

significance is unclear. In particular, while overexpressing

indicating that Bcl-xL is an essential mitotic survival
factor in DLD-1 cells. By contrast, note that in RKO cells,
Mcl-1 compensates for Bcl-xL loss during a prolonged
arrest (Fig. S1F and see also [32]). Interestingly,
comparing RKO and DLD-1 with four additional cell
lines showed a provocative correlation between relative
Mcl-1 levels and slippage. Specifically, both DLD-1 and
HCT116, which are slippage prone in the presence of taxol
(Fig. S4A), have relatively low levels of Mcl-1 (Fig. S4B)
and are resistant to Mcl-1 RNAi (Fig. S5). By contrast,
RKO, HeLa, HT29 and H1703, which more are prone to
death in mitosis (Fig. S4A), have relatively higher levels
of Mcl-1 (Fig. S4B).
Because Mcl-1-deficient DLD-1 cells still
underwent slippage, we measured the time from mitotic
entry to exit to determine if slippage kinetics were
affected. Analysis of the cumulative slippage frequency
showed that the time taken for 50% of the control cells
to slip (i.e. the T50) was 19.0 hours. Mcl-1 RNAi reduced
the T50 to 14.7 hours (Fig. 5D). Thus, suppressing
Mcl-1 levels accelerates slippage. We therefore asked
whether artificially elevating Mcl-1 levels would have
the opposite effect, i.e. delay slippage. To test this we
generated tet-inducible DLD-1 lines expressing either
wild type Mcl-1 or the Mcl-1RALA mutant (Fig 5E).
Induction of the wild type protein delayed slippage by
3.7 hours (Fig 5F). By contrast the Mcl-1RALA mutant
had no impact on the T50 (Fig. 5G). Thus, artificially
elevating Mcl-1 levels does indeed delay slippage
and this effect appears to require the putative D-box.
One possible explanation for these observations is that
Mcl-1 competes with Cyclin B1 for APC/C-Cdc20
binding in a D-box dependent manner such that when
Mcl-1 levels are reduced, Cyclin B1 is degraded faster
thereby accelerating slippage. Conversely when Mcl-1
is overexpressed, Cyclin B1 degradation is inhibited,
thereby delaying slippage.

Mcl-1 levels influence slippage
Overexpressing the Mcl-1 fragment containing the
putative D-box suggests that while Mcl-1 may not be a
bona fide E3 ligase substrate, it can engage APC/C-Cdc20
during a prolonged mitotic arrest. While the significance
of this in the context of regulating DiM is unclear, we
reasoned that if it was D-box-dependent it might influence
the interaction between Cyclin B1 and APC/C-Cdc20, and
thus influence slippage. To test this, we turned to DLD-1
cells, another colon cancer cell line that tends to undergo
slippage following a prolonged arrest [10]. Note that
as in RKO cells, Mcl-1 protein levels decline in DLD1 cells arrested in mitosis (Fig. 5A). First, we inhibited
Mcl-1 by RNAi (Fig. 5B) then added AZ138, an Eg5
kinesin inhibitor. In the control population, 80% of cells
underwent slippage (Fig. 5C). Of these, 10% then died in
the following interphase. Upon RNAi-mediated inhibition
of Mcl-1, a similar proportion (74%) underwent slippage,
but of these 62% then died in interphase, demonstrating
that Mcl-1 is an important post-mitotic survival factor, at
least in this context. Strikingly, RNAi-mediated inhibition
of Bcl-xL shifted the fate profile from slippage to DiM,

non-degradable and therefore resist mitotic proteolysis
and thus extend time to death in taxol-treated cultures. To
test this, we generated stable tet-inducible RKO cell lines
expressing either wild type Mcl-1 or a lysine-less mutant
[40] whereby all 14 lysines are mutated to arginine (Mcl1 ∆Lys, Fig. 4A). Significantly, while both wild type and
the lysine-less mutant delayed the time to DiM, they did
so to the same extent (Fig. 4B). This suggests that mitotic
degradation of Mcl-1 during mitosis may not be mediated
by the canonical ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Note
that previously, Stewart et al. showed that the lysine-less
Mcl-1 is also degraded in interphase cells in a manner
comparable to the wild type protein [40].

Suppressing Mcl-1 rescues delayed slippage
induced by Bax/Bak depletion

accelerated following Mcl-1 RNAi, and this was partially
rescued by co-depletion of Bax and Bak (Fig. S6). Thus,
a simple explanation for the delayed slippage observed in
Bax/Bak-deficient cells is the ability of liberated Mcl-1
to compete with Cyclin B1 and thus slow degradation of
the latter.

The ability of Mcl-1 to influence slippage as
shown above could help explain a recent and surprising
observation, namely that that RNAi-mediated inhibition
of Bax and Bak delayed slippage [41]. Because Mcl1 binds Bax and Bak (Fig. 6A and see also [42]), their
removal by RNAi would be expected to liberate Mcl-1,
thereby enabling it to engage with the APC/C-Cdc20 and/
or the proteasome and thus delay Cyclin B1 degradation.
To test this we depleted Bax and Bak in DLD-1 cells
and determined the cumulative slippage frequency (Fig.
6B). Consistent with the recent report, Bax/Bak co-RNAi
delayed the T50 for time to slippage from 18.3 hours to 21.1
hours, indicating delayed slippage (Fig. 6C). Consistent
with our data shown above, Mcl-1 RNAi reduced the T50
to 14.7 hours, indicating accelerated slippage. Importantly,
depleting Mcl-1 in Bax/Bak RNAi cells restored the
time to slippage, with a T50 of 16.5 hours. Moreover,
degradation of an mCherry D-box fusion [10] was

We previously showed that there is extensive
inter-line variation in terms of how different cancer
cell lines respond to a protracted mitotic arrest [10].
By using RKO and DLD-1 cells for the experiments
described above, we exploited this inter-line variation to
focus on DiM and slippage respectively; whereas RKO
typically undergo DiM, DLD-1 are slippage prone. Our
observations show that overexpressing Mcl-1 can delay
DiM in RKO and delay slippage in DLD-1. In principle
therefore, overexpressing Mcl-1 should delay DiM as
well as slippage in DLD-1 cells. To test this, we re-tuned

the DLD-1 experimental system to favor DiM instead of
slippage. Rather than using an Eg5 inhibitor, we used a
high dose of nocodazole; under these conditions, 64% of
the DLD-1 cells underwent DiM, presumably due to superactivation of the SAC and more penetrant APC/C-Cdc20
inhibition (Fig. 7A). Tet-induction of wild type Mcl-1 had
multiple effects. Firstly, of the cells that underwent DiM,
time to death was delayed from 23.2 hours to 33.2 hours
(Fig. 7B). Secondly, of the cells that underwent slippage,
post-mitotic death was delayed from 10.3 hours to 27.1
hours (Fig. 7C). Overexpressing the Mcl-1RALA mutant also
delayed DiM from 27.5 hours to 35.4 hours (Fig. 7B).
The competing networks model predicts that
delaying DiM provides more time for Cyclin B1
degradation and should therefore shift the fate profile
from DiM to slippage. Interestingly, overexpressing
Mcl-1 only had a marginal effect on the proportion of
cells undergoing slippage, from 36% in controls to

44% (Fig.  7A). This modest effect could be because
overexpressing Mcl-1 not only inhibits DiM but also
slows Cyclin B1 degradation by engaging with the
APC/C-Cdc20. Consistent with the Mcl-1RALA mutant not
engaging APC/C-Cdc20, overexpression of Mcl-1RALA
had a substantial effect on the number of cells undergoing
slippage, increasing it from 48% in controls to 80%
(Fig.  7A). Moreover, time to slippage was unaffected
in DLD-1 cells expressing either wild type Mcl-1 or
the RALA mutant (Fig. 7D). Thus, taken together, these
results show that overexpressing Mcl-1 in DLD-1 cells
delays both DiM and slippage, and that while the Mcl1RALA mutant is as effective at delaying DiM, it is less
effective at delaying slippage. Although we have no
direct evidence that wild type Mcl-1 binds Cdc20, these
observations are consistent with the notion put forward
by Harley et al., namely that Mcl-1 engages the APC/CCdc20 in a D-box dependent manner [22].

Delaying slippage enhances post-mitotic
apoptosis

to be the case (Fig. S7). However, in other conditions
there was no obvious correlation. We therefore set out to
test more directly whether a longer mitotic arrest prior to
slippage was more likely to induce post-mitotic death.
To do this, we obtained a DLD-1 cell line constitutively
expressing a myc-tagged OsTir transgene and generated
derivatives expressing a tet-inducible stabilized Cyclin
B1 R42A mutant fused to an AID tag so that it could be
degraded at will by addition of IAA (Fig. S8A and see
also [44, 45]). Quantitating GFP fluorescence indicated
that 50% of the GFP-AID-Cyclin B1 R42A protein was
degraded within 22 minutes following IAA treatment
(Fig. S8B). When an uninduced population was exposed to
the Eg5 inhibitor AZ138, 88% of cells arrested in mitosis
and underwent slippage after an average of 14.8 hours
(Fig.  8A). Upon tet-induction of GFP-AID-Cyclin B1
R42A, 70% of the AZ138-treated cells underwent DiM
with a mean arrest time of 29.6 hours. Addition of IAA at
the same time as the tetracycline reverted this phenotype,
consistent with IAA targeting the GFP-AID-Cyclin B1

As noted above, overexpressing Mcl-1 in DLD-1
cells delayed post-mitotic apoptosis (Fig 7A). Also, Mcl1 RNAi increased the proportion of cells undergoing
post-mitotic apoptosis following slippage from 10% to
62% (Fig. 5C). In addition, it was previously shown that
inhibition of Mcl-1 suppresses cell cycle progression in
interphase following nocodazole treatment [43]. This
points at a post-mitotic survival role for Mcl-1. We
therefore asked whether mitotic degradation of Mcl-1
might also act as a post-mitotic death timer. If so, then the
longer a cell spends arrested in mitosis, the more likely
Mcl-1 levels are to fall such that even if it survives for
long enough to undergo slippage, the more likely it is to
die in interphase. If correct, one might expect there to be
an inverse correlation between the time spent arrested in
mitosis before slippage and the time from exit to death.
Indeed, in some experimental conditions this does appear

R42A for SCF-Tir1-mediated degradation. Next, we tetinduced GFP-AID-Cyclin B1 R42A, exposed the cells to
AZ138 then added IAA either 20 or 30 hours later (Fig.
8B). When the IAA was added after 20 hours, it took on
average 6.9 hours for the cells to exit mitosis, presumably
because despite degrading the AID-tagged exogenous
Cyclin B1 R42A, there was sufficient endogenous Cyclin
B1 to maintain the mitotic state for several hours. Indeed,
when we added the IAA after 30 hours, it took only 2.4
hours on average to trigger mitotic exit, consistent with
further depletion of the endogenous protein; i.e. prior to
addition of the IAA, the mitotic state was dependent on
the exogenous GFP-AID-Cyclin B1 R42A. Moreover,
prolonging the addition of IAA to 30 hours significantly
extended the time to slippage (Fig. 8C). When the IAA
was added after 20 hours, only 16% of the cells underwent
post-mitotic death (Fig. 8B). By contrast, adding the IAA
after 30 hours resulted in 42% of the cells undergoing
post-mitotic death. Thus, adding IAA after 30 hours,
allowed us to keep the cells in mitosis for long enough
to deplete the endogenous Cyclin B1 but then drive them
out before they underwent DiM. Under these conditions,
cells were now much more likely to undergo postmitotic death. One explanation to account for this is that
extending the mitotic arrest provided more time for Mcl1 degradation such that pro-survival function in the next
interphase was compromised. However, it is also possible
that extending the mitotic arrest provided more time for
damage accumulation, regardless of Mcl-1 degradation
[43, 46, 47]. Consistent with this latter notion, we noted
that when the IAA was added after 20 hours, 60% of the
cells entered a second mitosis. By contrast, adding the IAA
after 30 hours resulted in only 7% of the cells entering a
second mitosis. Nevertheless, these data strongly support
the notion that the longer the duration of the mitotic arrest,
the more likely it is that post-mitotic responses will be
activated.

synthesized and degraded during a mitotic arrest, and
that mitotic degradation of Mcl-1 could serve as the death
timer evoked by the competing-networks model.
Canonical proteasome-mediated protein degradation
depends on the ubiquitin system, and three E3 ubiquitin
ligases have been implicated in targeting Mcl-1 for
degradation during mitosis [22, 26, 29]. However, we
have not been able to generate compelling evidence that
APC/C-Cdc20, FBW7 or MULE are involved. Moreover,
we have no compelling evidence that the activity of these
ligases is required for DiM. This could reflect redundancy;
however, simultaneously inhibiting all three E3 ligases
had no obvious effect. Consistently, Shi et al. reported
only a mild effect upon co-inhibition of MULE and
Cdc20 [29]. While we cannot rule out the possibility that
the modalities employed here are simply not penetrant
enough to block Mcl-1 ubiquitination, our observations
raise the possibility that Mcl-1 is not a bona fide target of
these E3 ligases during mitosis. Indeed, exogenous Mcl-1
harboring a mutation in the putative D-box did not prolong
survival over and above that of a wild type transgene.
One possibility is that during mitosis, Mcl-1 is degraded
in a proteasome-dependent manner that does not require
ubiquitination. This notion is supported by an analysis
of Mcl-1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts [40]. Stewart et
al. showed that Mcl-1 is degraded during interphase in a
proteasome-dependent manner. However, an Mcl-1 mutant
lacking all the lysine residues required for ubiquitination
was degraded as efficiently as the wild type protein.
Moreover, inhibiting the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes
UAE and UBA6 had no effect on Mcl-1 degradation. And
finally, an unmodified Mcl-1 substrate generated by in
vitro transcription and translation was degraded by the 20S
proteasome. Consistently, in our hands, the Mcl-1 mutant
lacking lysine residues had no additional effect over and
above the wild type control. Thus, although Mcl-1 may be
ubiquitinated by multiple E3 ligases, it appears to be one
of a growing list of proteins that can be degraded by the
proteasome in an ubiquitin-independent manner [48]. This
in turn provides a simple explanation for our observation
showing that MG132 inhibits DiM in a Mcl-1-dependent
manner but does not require APC/C-Cdc20, FBW7 or
MULE.
The competing networks model, in its original
formulation, proposed that the two networks responsible
for mitotic cell fate are independent [10], a notion
supported by predictive modeling [15]. However, a
number of molecular interactions connect the mitotic
and apoptotic pathways. For example, the master mitotic
kinase Cdk-1 phosphorylates several apoptotic proteins
including Caspase 9, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 [21, 22, 49, 50]. In
addition, Bim is targeted for degradation by APC/C-Cdc20
[18]. These molecular interactions raise the possibility that
there is crosstalk between the two networks. Indeed, it was
recently shown that inhibiting the SAC silencer p31comet
accelerated DiM, and that co-depletion of pro-apoptotic

DISCUSSION
We set out to define Mcl-1’s role in mitotic cell fate
determination. Initially, we focused on the role Mcl-1
degradation plays in determining the onset of apoptosis
during a prolonged mitotic arrest. Our observations
confirm that Mcl-1 is an important mitotic survival factor:
overexpressing Mcl-1 delays DiM and RNAi-mediated
inhibition accelerates DiM. Our observations also confirm
that Mcl-1 levels decline during a prolonged mitotic arrest.
This decline is reduced when the proteasome is inhibited
and accelerated when protein synthesis is suppressed.
Importantly, when slippage is completely blocked, i.e. in
taxol-treated cells expressing a stabilized form of Cyclin
B1, inhibiting the proteasome has a strikingly penetrant
effect, delaying DiM by many hours. Conversely, blocking
protein synthesis accelerates DiM. Taken together,
these observations indicate that Mcl-1 is continuously

Bax and Bak delayed slippage [41]. The possibility of
crosstalk presents a technical challenge as experimental
modulation of one network may influence the other,
thereby complicating interpretations. Indeed, SAC
genes frequently manifest in anti-mitotic siRNA survival
screens [32, 41, 51, 52], not because they directly promote
apoptosis but because they are required to prevent slippage
[53], which in turn allows time for the accumulation of
death signals [10].
To focus on the two networks separately, here we
first focused on RKO cells which typically undergo DiM
[10]. Importantly, expressing a non-degradable Cyclin B1
in taxol-treated RKO cells completely blocked slippage,
allowing us to use time-to-death to measure the integrity
of the apoptotic network. Conversely, to focus on slippage
we treated DLD-1 cells with an Eg5 inhibitor to create
conditions which favor slippage [10]. These approaches
demonstrate that experimentally altering Mcl-1 levels
can influence both DiM and slippage, which on face
value, appears to further support the notion of crosstalk.
However, as discussed above, because degradation of
Mcl1 in mitosis may be independent of an E3 ligase, it
may not be a regulated phenomenon. Thus, the ability of
Mcl-1 to influence slippage may be an epiphenomenon that
arises during a prolonged mitotic arrest due to the presence
of an RXXL motif that serves as a weak D-box allowing
it to engage APC/C-Cdc20 in a non-regulated manner. If
correct, the term crosstalk may be an over interpretation;
we therefore suggest that in this case, network interference
might be a more appropriate description.
The ability of Mcl-1 to be degraded by the
proteasome independently of ubiquitination [40] may also
provide alternative explanations for other observations that
evoke crosstalk. For example, p31comet RNAi inhibits SAC
silencing and super-inhibits APC/C-Cdc20 thus delaying
slippage by further inhibiting proteasome-dependent
degradation of Cyclin B1 [54, 55]. This may alleviate
competition between Cyclin B1 and Mcl-1 for proteasome
binding, thereby accelerating Mcl-1 degradation and
advancing the onset of DiM. Conversely, by co-depleting
Bax and Bak, the level of free Mcl-1 is expected to
increase [56], which could then increase competition
with Cyclin B1 thus slowing degradation of the latter
and delaying slippage. Further evidence that there may
not be genuine crosstalk comes from the recent discovery
that the oncogenic transcription factor MYC is a major
determinant of mitotic cell fate [32]. Specifically, MYC
promotes the death-in-mitosis network by upregulating
a cluster of redundant, pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins,
namely Bim, Bid and Noxa, and downregulating prosurvival Bcl-xL. Importantly, while inhibiting MYC in
RKO cells markedly delays DiM, it does not influence
slippage [32]. Consequently, although inhibiting MYC
promotes cell survival, the average amount of time spent
arrested in mitosis increases from 17.1 to 21.3 hours. This
supports the notion that the two networks responsible
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for mitotic cell fate are indeed independent. Moreover,
by evoking the concept of network interference, our
observations highlight the need for assays that can
experimentally focus on DiM without interfering with
slippage and vice versa.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell culture and drug treatments
Flp-In™ T-Rex™ DLD-1 and RKO cell lines were
cultured as described [57]. HeLa, HCT116, HT-29 and
H1703 were as described [10]. Flp-In™ T-Rex™ DLD1 cells expressing TIR1-9myc were kindly provided by
Andrew Holland [44]. Tet-inducible isogenic stable
lines were generated as described [58, 59]. In brief,
pcDNA5/FRT/TO-based plasmids containing tagged
human and mouse Mcl-1 and Cyclin B1 cDNAs were
co-transfected with pOG44 into Flp-In™ T-Rex™ cell
lines using Lipofectamine Plus™. Transfected cells
were selected using 80 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma)
and 8 μg/ml blasticidin then colonies pooled. Small
molecule inhibitors dissolved in DMSO were used at
the following concentrations: taxol (0.1 μM; Sigma),
AZ138 (1 μM; [10]), AZ127 (2 μM; Tocris), MG132 (20

3-Indoleacetic acid (IAA, 500 μM; Sigma). Transgenes
were induced with addition of 0.25-1 μg/ml tetracycline
(Sigma). Cell synchronization in early S-phase was
performed with 2 mM thymidine (Sigma).

pcDNA5/TO/GFP and pcDNA5/TO/GFP-AID vectors
such that tags were fused to the C-terminus, placing
the tagged ORFs downstream of a tet-regulatable CMV

cells were plated 24 hours prior to transfection then
transfections performed in antibiotic-free media with
0.5 μg DNA and DharmaFECT reagent (Dharmacon).
Following transfections, cells were incubated at 37°C
for 24 hours before addition of anti-mitotic agents. For
synchronization, thymidine was added to cells during the
transfection procedure.

Immunoprecipitation
The ORF encoding a GFP-binder [61] was cloned
into pGEX-4T3 then transformed into E.coli strain
BL21. The GST-GFP-binder fusion protein was induced
with IPTG, purified using Glutathione sepharose beads
(Amintra), eluted using soluble glutathione then dialyzed.
The purified GST-GFP-binder protein was then used to
affinity purify GFP-tagged proteins using Glutathione
sepharose beads. In brief, cells were plated into four 10
cm dishes per condition, cultured for 24 hours followed
by overnight induction of exogenous GFP-fused proteins
using tetracycline. Cells were trypsinized, pooled and
lysed in lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl,
10 mM Tris pH7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 20 mM
β-Glycerol, 10 mM NaF) then insoluble proteins removed
by centrifugation. To purify GFP-tagged proteins, a 50%
Glutathione magnetic bead slurry was washed in protein
lysis buffer, added to the lysate along with 30 μg of GSTGFP-binder protein then incubated under rotation for
three hours at 4°C. Beads were washed five times with
lysis buffer then bound proteins eluted by boiling in SDS
sample buffer. For input samples, 5% of the original
supernatant was removed.

Time-lapse imaging
For cell fate profiling, cells were seeded onto
microclear 96 well plates (Greiner) then analyzed using an
IncuCyte ZOOM (Essen BioSciences) equipped with a 20x
objective, acquiring images every 10 minutes. Confluency
measurements were performed using the IncuCyte ZOOM
software. Real time quantitation of apoptosis was also
performed on an IncuCyte ZOOM in conjunction with
CellPlayer Kinetic Caspase-3/7 Apoptosis Assay Kit
(EssenBioSciences) [32]. To determine mitotic timing
and cell fate, MPEG-4 image sequences were analyzed
manually, scoring 50 cells per condition from duplicate
wells. Zero hours represents when imaging started unless
indicated otherwise. Cell fate profiles were generated
using Graphpad Prism 6 [10]. For fluorescent analysis
of DLD-1 cells expressing the mCherry D-box fusion
[10], cells were seeded in a microclear 96 well plate
(Greiner) prior to RNAi transfections. For transient
transfections of mCherry-Mcl-1 fragments and fluorescent
tracking of AID-tagged proteins, cells were seeded into a

Immunoblotting
For immunoblotting, cells were seeded in 24 or 96
well plates (Corning) then later harvested by trypsinisation,
centrifuged, washed and lysed in SDS buffer (0.35 M
Tris pH 6.8, 0.1 g/ml sodium dodecyl sulfate, 93 mg/ml
dithiothreitol, 30% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bromophenol blue).
Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE then electro-blotted
onto Immobilion-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes
were blocked in 5% dried milk in TBST (50 mM Tris,
pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) then incubated
overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies
diluted in milk: rabbit anti-Mcl-1 (Santa-Cruz), sheep
anti-Tao1 [60], mouse anti-Cyclin B1 (Millipore), rabbit
anti-Bcl-xL (Cell Signalling), sheep anti-Bub3 (Holland
and Taylor, unpublished), rabbit anti-FBW7 (Bethyl),
