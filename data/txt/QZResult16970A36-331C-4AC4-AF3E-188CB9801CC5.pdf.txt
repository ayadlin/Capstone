Abstract
Platinum plays a central role in the therapy of ovarian cancer,
and the emergence of platinum resistance is a major obstacle
for clinical management of the disease. We treated A2780
ovarian cancer cells by weekly cycles of cisplatin over a period
of 6 months and unveiled that enhanced insulin-like growth
factor I receptor (IGF-IR) expression and autocrine IGF-I are
associated with hyperactivation of the IGF-IR and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) pathways in cisplatinresistant cells. IGF-IR expression levels increased during
treatment cycles and correlated with cisplatin resistance.
Purified IGF-I induced cisplatin resistance in diverse ovarian
cancer cell lines, and small molecule inhibitors proved that
IGF-IR and PI3K are essential for cisplatin resistance. Similar
results were obtained with BG-1 ovarian cancer cells.
Cytogenetic and array comparative genomic hybridization
analyses revealed selection and de novo formation of
chromosomal alterations during resistance development.
An analysis of gene expression profiles of primary ovarian
carcinomas identified the regulatory subunit PIK3R2 of PI3kinase as a significant negative prognosis factor for ovarian
cancer. We conclude that targeting the IGF-IR and the PI3K
pathways is a promising new strategy to treat cisplatinresistant ovarian carcinomas. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):2996–3003]

Introduction
In the Western world, epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal
gynecologic cancer (1). Epithelial ovarian cancer is a chemosensitive neoplasm, with initial overall response rates to systemic
therapy exceeding 80% when integrated with cytoreductive surgery
(1). Platinum-based chemotherapy has improved outcomes in
women with ovarian cancer in the last 25 years (2). Primary
postoperative chemotherapy has evolved from single alkylating
agents to cisplatin and cisplatin-based combinations, followed by
incorporation of paclitaxel and substitution of carboplatin for
cisplatin (1). Thus, platinum plays a central role in the therapy of

ovarian cancer, and the emergence of platinum resistance is a
major obstacle for clinical management of the disease (3). It
is evident from the literature that cellular resistance to cisplatin
is incompletely understood and the current state of the art is
insufficient for translation into clinical applications (4–6). Ovarian
cancer patients are treated by multiple cycles of postoperative
chemotherapy (3), and the emergence of resistance to chemotherapy is a process that ranges from months to years (1, 3).
To mimic this process in tissue culture, we developed a novel
strategy and investigated the development of cisplatin resistance in
human breast cancer cells (7). It was the aim of this work to use
this strategy to study cisplatin resistance in A2780 ovarian cancer
cells that are sensitive for chemotherapeutic agents (8, 9). They are
wild-type with respect to p53 and RAS (10, 11). Previously, cisplatinresistant A2780 cells (A2780CP) were generated by exposure to
increasing concentrations of cisplatin (9). Here, we used weekly
cycles of an IC50 dose of cisplatin and monitored the dynamics of
resistance development over a period of 24 weeks. We report that
hyperactivation of the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor
pathway is a crucial step for the development of cisplatin
resistance in A2780 ovarian cancer cells. We have thus identified
a mechanism for cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, which is
distinct from the one in breast cancer where amphiregulindependent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
signaling pathway provoked resistance (7). Hence, cell type and
tumor type–specific mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance have
to be taken into account for the development of effective therapies.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and preparation of cell lysates. HEY, OVCAR-8, SKOV-3,
BG-1, and A2780 ovarian cancer cells were obtained from a cell line
repository (JJ Hernando, Womans Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany).
A2780CP cells were from the European Collection of Cell Culture. Cells were
cultivated in RPMI 1640 (Biochrom) containing 10% FCS, 100 IU/mL
penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. The preparation of whole cell
lysates has been described (7).
Signaling pathway analysis. The functional status of signaling
pathways was measured by Proteome Profiler human phospho–receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) and human phospho–mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) antibody arrays (R&D Systems) as reported (7). The IGF-I
ELISA procedure followed a protocol from the producer (R&D Systems).
Analysis of IGF-I receptor expression. For immunoblotting, standard
procedures were used. To detect the IGF-I receptor (IGFI-R), the affinitypurified AF-305-NA antibody and the HAF 109 donkey anti-goat IgG–
horseradish peroxidase antibody (R&D systems) were used. Immunoblots

Biosciences).
Matrigel invasion and BrdUrd proliferation assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell growth assay,
and signaling inhibitors. To determine invasive potential of A2780 CisR
cells, the CytoSelect assay (Cell Biolabs Inc.) was used (7). The BrdUrd
proliferation assay (Roche Applied Science) was done as described (7). For
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays,
we followed our published protocol (7). Signaling inhibitors LY294002
(5 Amol/L), U0126 (2.5 Amol/L), Wortmannin (30 nmol/L), AG 1024 (1 Amol/L;
Sigma-Aldrich), or IGFBP 4 (0.1 Amol/L; R&D Systems) were added to the
tissue culture medium 1 h before the addition of cisplatin.
Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses.
Metaphase chromosomes were prepared following standard procedures.
Giemsa karyotypes were generated according to International System for
Human Cytogenic Nomenclature (12), and fluorescence in situ hybridizations (FISH) were performed as described (13). PAC/BAC probes were
from (Genome Systems; imaGenes). GS-1186-B18 (3p, PAC), GS-1061-L1
(20p, PAC), RP11-1129-O4 (1p, BAC), and GS-580-L5 (8p, PAC; ref. 14) were
labeled with cyanine 3-dUTP (Cy3) or cyanine 5-dUTP (Cy5) so that two
probes could be visualized in one combined hybridization.
Array comparative genomic hybridization and data analysis. DNA
was isolated with the Qiagen Mini kit (tissue protocol) and digested with

www.aacrjournals.org

AluI and RsaI (Promega). Purified DNA (1.5 Ag of each) was labeled with
Cy5 (A2780 cells) or Cy3 (A2780 CisR cells) using the Genomic DNA
labeling kit Plus (Agilent). Cy5- and Cy3-labeled samples were combined
and hybridized for 40 h at 65jC with the Human Genome Comparative
Genomic Hybridization (CGH) Microarray 244A (Agilent). Data analysis
was described previously (15). For better interpretability, the resulting
data set was transformed from the original base 10 to base 2 log-ratios.
CGH-plots were created for visual inspection using two software
packages based on R: Bioconductor’s array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) package5 for genome wide plots, and the GLAD
package for chromosome specific plots with automatic break point
detection (16).
Quantification of IGF-IR mRNA by real-time reverse transcriptionPCR. Our reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocol has been published
(7). The pri mers us ed were IGF-I R f or wa r d ( 5¶-GAAGTGGAACCCTCCCTCTC-3¶) and IGF-IR reverse (5¶-CTTCTCGGC
TTCAGTTTTGG-3¶); b-actin forward (5¶-AGAAAATCTGGCACCACACC-3¶)
and b-actin reverse (5¶-CAGAGGCGTACAGGGATAGC-3¶). The IGF-IR
mRNA concentration was normalized to b-actin mRNA.

Data analysis. Indicated are the mean values F SE. Concentration effect
curves were fitted to the data points by nonlinear regression analysis using
the four-parameter logistic equation (GraphPad Prism).
Statistical methods. Assays were performed at least in triplicate.
Statistical significance was assessed by two-tailed Student’s t test for single
comparison and ANOVA for multiple comparisons, respectively.

Results
Generation and characterization of cisplatin-resistant
A2780 ovarian cancer cells. A2780 cells were exposed to weekly
cycles (4 hours) of 2 Amol/L cisplatin over a period of 24 weeks.
The resistance factor after 24 treatment cycles was calculated as 5.8
(**, P < 0.01; Fig. 1A). Cisplatin-resistant cells were denoted A2780
CisR and they remained resistant after cultivation in drug-free
media for at least 4 months (Supplementary Fig. S1). A2780 CisR
cells are characterized by reduced proliferation rates (Fig. 1B) and
an increased ability to degrade and, thus, invade the matrix of a
reconstituted basement membrane (Fig. 1C). Hence, cisplatin
resistance and tumor cell aggressiveness are linked to each other.
To investigate whether A2780 CisR cells developed cross-resistance,
we analyzed the anthracycline doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S2)
and measured a resistance factor of 4.2.
Hyperactivation of the IGF-IR pathway in A2780 CisR
ovarian cancer cells. Next, we analyzed the functional status of
RTKs and downstream signaling pathways in A2780 CisR cells
using antibody arrays. We find a selective phosphorylation of the
IGF-IR (Fig. 1D). The IGF-IR signaling pathway is connected to
three major MAPK pathways (reviewed in ref. 17). We used a
human phospho-MAPK antibody array (7; Supplementary Table S1)
and detected moderate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1

and ERK2 phosphorylation in A2780 cells, which is markedly
increased in A2780 CisR cells (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, the
phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (18) did not change
(data not shown). The p38 MAPK module consists of four isoforms
and we detected p38 a phosphorylation in A2780 cells, which is
increased in A2780 CisR cells (Fig. 1D). The IGF-IR pathway is also
linked to the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway by insulin receptor substrate 1 (reviewed in ref. 17). PI3K
regulates the translocation of AKT-kinase to the cell membrane
where it becomes phosphorylated at S473 by phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 and the rictor–mammalian target of rapamycin
complex (19). AKT1 and AKT2 are moderately phosphorylated in
A2780 cells and phosphorylation is strongly increased in A2780
CisR cells. These data show that hyperactivation of the IGF-IR and
PI3K signaling pathways is associated with cisplatin resistance.
Temporal dynamics of IGF-IR gene expression correlate
with cisplatin resistance in A2780 ovarian cancer cells.
Cisplatin resistance development was monitored by MTT assays
(Fig. 2A). The cells developed cisplatin resistance after 6 treatment
cycles, which steadily increased up to treatment cycle 12. We also
measured the levels of IGF-IR mRNA (Fig. 2B). A comparison of the
dynamics of cisplatin resistance development (Fig. 2A) and the
dynamics of IGF-IR gene expression (Fig. 2B) reveals an almost
identical curve progression. This result shows that IGF-IR
expression levels correlate with the extent of cisplatin resistance
of A2780 ovarian cancer cells.
Hyperactivation of the IGF-IR pathway is associated with
enhanced IGF-IR expression and constitutive IGF-I secretion.
We determined IGF-IR expression by immunoblotting using
an antibody specific for the extracellular domain of the IGF-IR

IGF-IR Signaling and Cisplatin Resistance in Ovarian Cancer

Figure 3. The IGF-IR signaling pathway determines cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells. A, IGF-IR expression in diverse human ovarian cancer cells correlates
significantly with cisplatin resistance. Cisplatin IC50 values from MTT assays were correlated with IGF-IR gene expression. The correlation coefficient was calculated

(Fig. 2C). A2780 cells express very low levels of the IGF-IR,
which are strongly enhanced in A2780 CisR cells. The same
result was obtained by immunofluorescence analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). Next, we investigated the status of IGF-I. To
measure IGF-I in tissue culture supernatants, we used a
sandwich ELISA (Fig. 2D) and detected constitutive IGF-I
secretion from the resistant cells. Exposure of A2780 CisR cells
to cisplatin or serum deprivation did not affect IGF-I secretion
(data not shown). Thus, increased IGF-IR expression in
combination with constitutive IGF-I secretion provides a
mechanism for hyperactivation of the IGF-IR pathway in
cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells.
IGF-IR signaling through the PI3K pathway is crucial for
cisplatin resistance. To determine the relevance of IGF-IR and
PI3K signaling pathways for cisplatin resistance, we used specific
inhibitors. We applied IGF binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4), which is a
functional antagonist of IGF-I (reviewed in ref. 20), and
determined IC50 values of cisplatin dose response curves.
IGFBP-4 sensitized A2780 CisR cells significantly (Supplementary
Table S2). Likewise, AG 1024, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
selectively inhibits the IGF-IR sensitized the resistant cells
significantly. Next, we used the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and
Wortmannin. These inhibitors efficiently sensitized A2780 CisR
cells to cisplatin. As IGFBP-4, LY294002, and Wortmannin had
almost identical effects, we conclude that IGF-IR–dependent
signaling through the PI3K pathway is responsible for cisplatin
resistance. In contrast, the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is not
involved as inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling by the MAP/ERK
kinase 1/2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 did not affect cisplatin
resistance (Supplementary Table S2).
IGF-IR expression and cisplatin resistance in diverse human
ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Next, we measured IGF-IR mRNA
expression levels and determined cisplatin resistance in a panel of
ovarian cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A). SKOV-3 and OVCAR-8 are
derived from metastatic tumors of patients previously treated with
chemotherapy (21, 22). HEY was derived from a peritoneal deposit
of a patient with a moderately differentiated papillary cystadeno-

www.aacrjournals.org

carcinoma (23), and BG-1 was derived from the solid primary
tumor tissue from an untreated patient with stage III, very poorly
differentiated ovarian adenocarcinoma (24). We correlated IGF-IR
expression levels with IC50 values from MTT assays and found a
correlation coefficient of 0.9534, which is statistically highly
significant (**, P = 0.0032). Thus, the level of IGF-IR mRNA
predicts the extent of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.
To check whether IGF-IR signaling through the PI3K pathway
effects cisplatin resistance of other ovarian cancer cell lines, we
selected BG-1 cells that are cisplatin resistant. They express high
levels of IGF-IR mRNA (Fig. 3A) and very high levels of IGF-IR
protein (25). The IGF-IR inhibitor AG 1024 and the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 significantly sensitized BG-1 cells to cisplatin (Fig. 3B
and C). These data show that the IGF-IR and PI3K pathways also
mediate cisplatin resistance in another ovarian cancer cell line and
thus are of more general importance.
IGF-I mediates a bystander effect for cisplatin resistance in
diverse ovarian cancer cells. Because most ovarian cancers
express the IGF-IR, we hypothesized that IGF-I secreted from
cisplatin-resistant cells might mediate a bystander effect in ovarian
cancer patients. To test this hypothesis, we used A2780 cells as an
in vitro model and cultivated the cells in conditioned medium from
A2780 CisR cells. After 3 days, the level of sensitivity to cisplatin did
not change. However, after 8 days, A2780 cells developed a
cisplatin-resistant phenotype with a resistance factor of 3.04
(Fig. 4A), which was fully reversible after cultivation in normal
medium (data not shown). This shows that factors present in the
conditioned medium initiated a process leading to cisplatin
resistance, which is dependent on the continuous presence of
these factors. To investigate the effect IGF-I, we cultivated A2780
cells in conditioned medium for 8 days in the presence of IGFBP-4,
which antagonizes IGF-I. Under these conditions, no resistance to
cisplatin developed (Fig. 4B). Identical results were obtained, when
the cells were cultivated in the presence of a neutralizing IGF-I–
specific antibody (data not shown). Next, we cultivated A2780 cells
for 8 days in the presence of 0.1 Amol/L IGF-I and MTT assays
revealed an IC50 value for cisplatin, which is similar to the one

obtained by conditioned medium (Fig. 4C). We also cultivated Hey,
OVCAR-8, SKOV-3, and BG-1 ovarian cancer cells in the presence of
0.1 Amol/L IGF-I for 8 days and determined the IC50 values for
cisplatin (Supplementary Table S3). The data show that cisplatin
resistance was significantly increased in all cell lines. Hence, IGF-I
secretion from cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells will most

likely exert a bystander effect for cisplatin resistance in women
with ovarian cancer.
Identification of the regulatory subunit PIK3R2 of PI3kinase as prognostic biomarker for ovarian cancer. Next, we
analyzed microarray data (Supplementary Materials and Methods)
of a cohort of 80 ovarian cancer patients (Supplementary Table S4),
whose clinical outcomes have been registered and asked whether
the expression levels of genes from the IGF-IR and PI3K pathways
would correlate with clinical outcome. We find that PIK3R2
expression had a significant negative correlation (P = 0.037; Fig. 5A)
and AKT2 expression a borderline significant negative correlation
(P = 0.070) with overall survival (data not shown). PIK3R2 is a
regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase. It is interesting to note (Fig. 5B)
that PIK3R2 expression negatively correlated with clinical outcome
(P = 0.026) in an independent study of 83 advanced-stage serous
ovarian cancers (26).6 As the above microarray data were from
untreated tumors, additional studies with microarray data from
ovarian cancer tissue after cisplatin treatment are necessary.
However, patients with advanced disease do not routinely undergo
surgery for additional tissue samples to be collected (27).
Selection and acquisition of structural genomic alterations
in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. It is unresolved
whether selective or adaptive mechanisms contribute to cisplatin
resistance. To address this issue, we applied cytogenetics, FISH, and
aCGH. A2780 CisR cells had several chromosomal abnormalities in
common with A2780CP cells (28) that were generated by increasing
cisplatin concentrations (9) including monosomy of chromosome

A2780 CisR cells exhibit additional chromosomal alterations
(Fig. 6A–C). aCGH unveiled two larger gains of chromosome 3p
(3p26) and 20p (20p12), which are shown as insets on the left (3p)
and on the right (20p) in Fig. 6D. Several aberrations were verified
by FISH and the final karyotype of A2780 CisR cells was compiled
from aCGH, FISH, and conventional karyotype analysis:

Telomere probes from chromosome 8p (green) and 1p (red)
showed that the der8 (28) contains a subtelomeric insertion of
1p22p36 splitting the telomere 8p (green arrows) and retaining the
telomere 1p (red arrow; Fig. 6A). The copy number gain of 3p26
detected by aCGH showed a fold change of 1.5, which is explained
by the fact that 3 copies were observed in FISH with a 3p telomere
probe, 2 on the normal chromosome 3, and 1 on the der(1)t(1;3;

(Fig. 6D, arrows), and several copy number gains and losses
(Supplementary Table S5). Next, we investigated whether monosomy 13 was already present in nonresistant A2780 cells using FISH
with two different probes from chromosome 13. Monosomy 13 was
found in 2.1% of A2780 and 100% of A2780 CisR cells,
demonstrating selection of this chromosomal alteration. In
addition, 3 copies of 20p12 (Fig. 6C) were already present in 3.9%
of A2780 cells and 1.5% had four copies. In contrast, the copy
number gain of 3p26 in cisplatin-resistant cells (Fig. 6B) was
undetectable in A2780 cells. Thus, A2780 cells with copy number
gains of 20p12 were selected during cisplatin resistance development and the copy number gain of 3p26 is a de novo event.

Discussion
We used A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells as an in vitro
model to investigate the dynamics of cisplatin resistance

development. We analyzed structural genomic alterations, gene
expression, and the activities of selected signal transduction
pathways. We clarified that the development of cisplatin resistance
is associated with the selection of preexisting genomic alterations
and the acquisition of de novo changes demonstrating that both
selective and adaptive processes are linked to the development of
cisplatin resistance.
We show here that hyperactivation of the IGF-IR signaling
pathway is a crucial step for the development of cisplatin
resistance of A2780 ovarian cancer cells. The IGF-IR is physiologically expressed in the ovary and the IGF-IR pathway is functional
in human ovarian surface epithelial cells, which are the origin of
most epithelial ovarian carcinomas (29–31). This explains why
most ovarian carcinomas and ovarian cancer cell lines express the
IGF-IR (32).
We worked out that IGF-IR–dependent signaling through the
PI3K pathway mediates cisplatin resistance in A2780 CisR and BG1 ovarian cancer cells, which indicates a more general relevance of
this result. In this context, it is important to note that CAOV-3 and
OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells, which are also resistant to cisplatin
(22, 33), express autocrine IGF-I (34). Likewise, cisplatin-resistant
SKOV-3 (22) and OVCAR-4 (35) cells express both IGF-I and the
IGF-IR (36, 37). Taken together, these results provide strong
evidence for an essential role of the IGF-IR signaling pathway for
cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.
A2780 cells have been used before to create a series of cisplatinresistant cell lines that were selected by chronic exposure of
increasing cisplatin concentrations (9). aCGH analysis revealed
common genomic alterations in A2780 CisR and A2780CP cells (28),
which are highlighted by boldface type in the karyotype formula.
However, A2780 CisR cells also display unique genomic alterations.
This shows that A2780 cells react differently to distinct cisplatin
treatment regimens. This is corroborated by the finding that IGF-IR
phosphorylation is not elevated in A2780CP cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Even so, the PI3K pathway is essential for cisplatin
resistance in these cells. We noted increased AKT1 and AKT2
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4), and the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 sensitized A2780CP cells significantly to cisplatin
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
To show the effect of our findings for ovarian cancer patients, it
is necessary to validate the results in a clinical situation. This could
be achieved by investigating ovarian carcinomas with an early
relapse after chemotherapy. However, patients with advanced
disease do not routinely undergo surgery for additional tissue
samples to be collected (27), and this explains why the necessary
tumor specimens are difficult to obtain. However, an extensive
survey of published data revealed convincing evidence for a role of
IGF-IR and PI3K signaling pathways in ovarian cancer patients.
Ovarian cancer tissue samples express increased amounts of IGFIR compared with normal ovarian tissues (38). The levels of IGF-IR
are significantly higher in the tumors of patients with recurrent or
persistent disease after chemotherapy (39). Recurrent or persistent
tumors of this study were collected at second-look or subsequent
laparotomy (39). Moreover, IGF-I peptide is increased in cyst fluids

of epithelial ovarian cancer (40), and in the ascites of ovarian
cancer patients (41). A clinical study unveiled that IGF axis gene
expression patterns are prognostic of survival in epithelial ovarian
cancer (42). Yet another clinical study showed that a high level of
free IGF-I peptide was independently associated with the
progression of ovarian cancer (43).
We report that IGF-IR–dependent signaling through the PI3K
pathway determines cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.
Genetic data already provided evidence for a role of the PI3K
pathway in the etiology of ovarian cancer as components of this
pathway are mutated, amplified, or aberrantly expressed in ovarian
cancer tissue. For example, PI3KCA is implicated as an oncogene in
ovarian cancer (44), and PIK3R1 is constitutively activated by
mutations (45). We have found that elevated levels of PIK3R2
expression negatively affect outcome in patients with ovarian
cancer. AKT2 is amplified in 12% of ovarian carcinomas (46), and it
was reported that AKT2 provokes cisplatin resistance in ovarian
cancer cells (47). We have found that AKT2 expression has a
negative correlation with overall survival of patients with ovarian
cancer.
Therapeutic perspectives. It can be concluded from these
results that the IGF-IR and PI3K signaling pathways are of
immediate importance for the therapy of cisplatin-resistant ovarian
carcinomas. Because IGF-I mediates a bystander effect for cisplatin
resistance, it is a meaningful strategy to target the IGF-IR or PI3K to
improve the efficacy of platinum based chemotherapy. As the PI3K
pathway is also activated in ovarian carcinomas, it might be a
promising strategy to use a combination therapy that targets the
IGF-IR on the one hand and components of the PI3K pathway on
the other. A variety of IGF-IR and PI3K inhibitors are used in clinical
trials for the therapy of diverse cancers (48, 49). It is also feasible to
target downstream components of the PI3K pathway. For example
RAD001 (everolimus) targets mammalian target of rapamycin,
which is required for AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 (19). RAD001
inhibits human ovarian cancer cell proliferation, enhances cisplatininduced apoptosis, and prolongs survival in an ovarian cancer
model (50). RAD001 is used in a large variety of clinical studies7
aimed at treating diverse malignant diseases. We envision that
our results will translate into the clinic and aid to develop novel
therapies targeting the IGF-IR and PI3K pathways in ovarian cancer.
