BACKGROUND: Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare tumor with poor prognosis. First-line platinum-based
chemotherapy is active in patients with advanced SBA, but data regarding second-line chemotherapy are lacking.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI
regimen) as second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced SBA. METHODS: We analyzed all consecutive
patients who received second-line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI among 93 patients with advanced SBA included from
1996 to 2008 in a previous retrospective multicenter study. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
were estimated from the start of second-line chemotherapy using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox models were
applied for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Among 51 patients who received second-line chemotherapy, 28 patients
(male, 57%; median age, 54 years; metastatic disease, 96%) were treated with FOLFIRI after progression (n ¼ 24) or
limiting toxicity (n ¼ 4) to first-line FOLFOX (n ¼ 19) or LV5FU2-cisplatin (n ¼ 9). Grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in
48% of patients (grade 3-4 neutropenia, 37%). After a median follow-up of 21.5 months, all patients had tumor progression, and 22 patients died. Objective response rate was 20%, and disease control rate was 52%. Median PFS and
OS were 3.2 and 10.5 months, respectively. No clinical, biological, or tumor characteristics were associated with PFS
or OS by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Second-line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI produced disease control in
half of patients with advanced SBA after failure with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the short

Second-Line FOLFIRI in Advanced SBA/Zaanan et al

Although the small intestine accounts for 75% of
the length and 90% of the absorptive surface area of the
gastrointestinal tract, small bowel malignancies account
for fewer than 5% of gastrointestinal cancers, with 6110
new cases and 1100 deaths in the United States in 2008.1
Historically, small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) was the
most common histological subtype, representing 30%50% of malignant small bowel tumors. However, because
of a steady rise in the incidence of carcinoid tumors over
the last decades, SBA became the second most common
cancer of the small bowel.2 Epidemiological data suggest
that the annual incidence of SBA is about 2.2-5.7 per million inhabitants in Western countries.3 Nevertheless, the
incidence of SBA is increasing, particularly with a duodenal location.4,5
SBA carries a poor prognosis, with an all-stage disease-specific 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of about
30% and a median OS time of about 19 months.6 Because
of the nonspecific nature of presenting clinical manifestations and the lack of effective tools for exploring the small
bowel, SBA is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. At
diagnosis, about 40% of patients have lymph node metastases (stage III), and 35% to 40% have distant metastases
(stage IV).7,8
Retrospective studies have suggested that chemotherapy prolongs OS in patients with advanced SBA.7,9,10
Cytotoxic agents are usually the same as those used to treat
patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), that is,
oral or intravenous fluoropyrimidines, platinum salts, and
irinotecan.11-15 Some studies have suggested that frontline
platinum-based chemotherapy is active in patients with
advanced SBA, especially oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.12-15 However, there is no standard frontline regimen
because of a lack of randomized trials. In addition, there
are no data regarding second-line chemotherapy after failure of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in patients
with advanced SBA. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the efficacy and tolerability of fluorouracil, leucovorin,
and irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen) as second-line chemotherapy among patients with advanced SBA who failed
prior first-line platinum-based chemotherapy included
from 1996 to 2008 in our previous retrospective multicenter study.15
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Patients
This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review board. We analyzed all consecutive patients who

Cancer

April 1, 2011

received second-line chemotherapy by FOLFIRI among
patients with advanced SBA included from November
1996 to February 2008 in our previous retrospective multicenter study.15 Patient files were retrieved from tumor
registries of pathology departments and information system medical programs at 11 university hospitals, 1 general
hospital, and 1 comprehensive cancer center in France
using International Statistical Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes C17.0 (duodenum),
C17.1 (jejunum), and C17.2 (ileum). Inclusion criteria
were all patients with histologically proven, locally
advanced (unresectable or incompletely resected tumors)
or metastatic SBA (patients with ampullary tumors were
excluded).
Data Collection
The patients’ medical records were reviewed to collect relevant data on demographics, tumor characteristics, firstline chemotherapy regimen received, carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) serum level before the start of second-line
chemotherapy, toxicity, tumor response, date of disease
progression with second-line FOLFIRI, and survival status at the last follow-up. Grades of toxicity were assessed
from physical examination and biological tests performed
at the time of each course of chemotherapy according to
the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0.
Tumor response was assessed in patients with measurable disease using computed tomography (CT) scans
according to World Health Organization criteria.16 Complete response was defined as the complete disappearance
of all clinically assessable disease, and partial response was
defined as a decrease of at least 50% of the sum of the
products of the diameters of measurable lesions. Stable
disease was defined as a decrease of less than 50% or an
increase of less than 25% of measurable lesions, and progressive disease was defined as an increase of at least 25%
of measurable lesions or the appearance of new malignant
lesion(s). Patients with nonmeasurable disease were evaluated for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) only.
Treatment and Follow-Up
In keeping with the inclusion criteria, all patients included
in this study received second-line chemotherapy according to the FOLFIRI regimen corresponding to the simplified LV5FU2 regimen (leucovorin, 400 mg/m2 in a
2-hour infusion; fluorouracil, 400 mg/m2 bolus, then
2400 mg/m2 as a 46-hour infusion17) combined with

1423

Original Article

irinotecan (180 mg/m2 in a 90-minute infusion on day 1)
every 2 weeks.18
Physical examination and biological tests were performed before each treatment administration, and a CT
scan was performed every 2 months (or earlier in patients
with suspected disease progression). Chemotherapy was
continued until limiting toxicity or disease progression.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were performed with a bilateral alpha type 1
error of 5%. Progression-free survival was defined as the
time elapsed from the start of second-line chemotherapy
until date of progression or death (all causes), whichever
came first. Surviving patients without disease progression
were censored on the last follow-up date. Overall survival
was defined as the time elapsed from the start of secondline chemotherapy until death (all causes). Surviving
patients were censored on the last follow-up date. Survival
curves were drawn according to the Kaplan-Meier
method19 and compared with the log-rank test.20 Univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional hazards
model) were used to calculate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.21 Median follow-up was calculated with
the reverse Kaplan-Meier method.
The following predefined variables were examined
in univariate analyses of PFS and OS: sex, age, WHO performance status (PS), previous treatments (surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy), metastatic sites, primary tumor
site, number of tumor sites (including the primary site for
unresected primary tumors), baseline serum CEA levels
(upper limit of normal values, 5 ng/mL), study period
(SBA diagnosis 2002 vs >2002), and first-line chemotherapy regimen received.
Multivariate analysis included variables potentially
predictive of the risk of disease progression or death in
univariate analysis (threshold, 20%). P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of progression-free
survival (A) and overall survival (B) from the start of secondline chemotherapy with FOLFIRI in patients with advanced
small bowel adenocarcinoma is shown.

Toxicity
All but 1 of the patients were assessable for toxicity.
Almost half the patients (48%) developed severe adverse
events. Severe toxicity was mainly hematologic, with 37%
having grade 3-4 neutropenia (Table 2). The other main
grade 3-4 toxicity was gastrointestinal, such as nausea/
vomiting (11%) or diarrhea (3%). There was 1 therapyrelated death as a result of grade 4 neutropenic toxicity.
Tumor Response
Tumor response was assessable in 25 patients with measurable disease (Table 3). There were no complete
responses (CR) and 5 partial responses (PR). The objective response rate (CR þ PR) was 20%, and the disease
control rate (CR þ PR þ stable disease) was 52%.
Survival
Median PFS from the start of second-line chemotherapy
was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.4-5.8 months; Fig. 1A). The
1-year PFS rate was 10.7% (95% CI, 2.7%-25.1%). By

univariate analysis, there was no factor that was significantly prognostic of PFS (Table 4). Therefore, multivariate analysis was not performed.
Median OS from the start of second-line chemotherapy was 10.5 months (95% CI, 5.8-16.5 months; Fig.
1B). The 1-year OS rate was 38.2% (95% CI, 19.9%56.4%). Among the 2 potential prognostic variables
selected by univariate analysis (prior surgery and first-line
chemotherapy regimen received; Table 4), none was significant on multivariate analysis (Table 5). However,
first-line FOLFOX chemotherapy was associated with a
trend toward improved OS compared with first-line
LV5FU2-cisplatin (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 0.97-6.81; P ¼
.06; Table 5). Median OS from the start of first-line
chemotherapy was 18.7 months (95% CI, 13.7-29.9
months).

Third-Line Chemotherapy
Among the 28 patients with advanced SBA treated with
second-line FOLFIRI, 12 (43%) received third-line
chemotherapy consisting of irinotecan-based chemotherapy with cetuximab (n ¼ 4) or bevacizumab (n ¼ 1), mitomycin C (n ¼ 2), oxaliplatin with raltitrexed (n ¼ 1),
LV5FU2-cisplatin (n ¼ 1), FOLFOX (n ¼ 1), 5FU alone
(n ¼ 1), or docetaxel (n ¼ 1).

DISCUSSION
In this retrospective multicenter study, we observed that
second-line chemotherapy with the FOLFIRI regimen
produced disease control in half of patients with advanced
SBA after failure of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating

the efficacy and safety of a second-line chemotherapy in
patients with advanced SBA. Like patients with metastatic
CRC, patients with advanced SBA are usually treated by
fluoropyrimidine alone or in combination with platinum
salts or irinotecan. The combination of fluorouracil and
platinum salt (especially oxaliplatin) seems to be active in
front-line chemotherapy.12-15 Furthermore, we observed
in our previous retrospective multicenter study that
patients treated in first-line therapy by FOLFOX had a
trend toward a longer PFS and OS compared with those
treated with the first-line FOLFIRI regimen (PFS, 6.9 vs
6.0 months; OS, 17.8 vs 10.6 months).15 Thus, as irinotecan may be less effective than platinum salts in first-line
treatment, it was interesting to evaluate the FOLFIRI regimen as second-line chemotherapy.
The results of the present study revealed that despite
a fair disease control rate, median PFS was short (3.2
months). This suggests modest activity of the FOLFIRI
regimen as second-line treatment in patients with
advanced SBA after failure of platinum salt-based firstline chemotherapy. There is very little information in the
literature on the use of second- and third-line chemotherapy for advanced SBA. In a retrospective study evaluating
the efficacy of fluorouracil and platinum salts in first-line
chemotherapy in 20 patients with advanced SBA, secondline chemotherapy was administered to 13 patients.
Among them, 8 patients received FOLFIRI regimen,
which resulted in disease stabilization in 4 patients (50%)
and a median PFS of 5 months.12 Overman et al observed
that among 57 chemotherapy treatments administered as
second- or third-line chemotherapy to 38 patients with
advanced SBA, only 6 objective responses were noted,
including 2 of 16 patients treated with irinotecan-based
therapy.13 Because of their retrospective nature and the

Cancer

April 1, 2011

small numbers of patients in these studies, these data
should be interpreted with caution.
In multivariate analysis, we did not find an association between clinical, biological, or tumor characteristics
and PFS or OS. A lack of statistical power may account
for this result. However, first-line FOLFOX chemotherapy was associated with a trend toward improved OS
compared with the LV5FU2-cisplatin regimen (HR,
2.57; 95% CI, 0.97-6.81; P ¼ .06). In our previous study
of first-line chemotherapy in advanced SBA, we observed
that slightly more patients had a good PS in the FOLFOX
group compared with the LV5FU2-cisplatin group (PS,
0-1; 73% vs 69%).15 In addition, duodenal location was
more frequent in the LV5FU2-cisplatin group than in the
FOLFOX group (62% vs 52%).15 These 2 prognostic factors3,8,10 may have an impact on the survival of patients
treated with FOLFIRI in second-line therapy.15 In addition, patients treated with first-line LV5FU2-cisplatin
experienced significantly more grade 3-4 toxicities than
did patients treated with first-line FOLFOX.15 Toxicity
in first-line treatment may have influenced survival with
second-line chemotherapy.
Median OS from the start of first-line chemotherapy
was 18.7 months. These figures are close to those reported
for patients with advanced CRC treated with FOLFOX
followed by FOLFIRI at disease progression (20.6
months).22 In our study, prolonged OS from the start of
first-line chemotherapy, despite the short PFS with second-line FOLFIRI, might be explained by the targeted
therapies used in almost half of patients who received
third-line chemotherapy. Thus, sequential use of modern
chemotherapy regimens may improve survival of patients
with advanced SBA.
Because of the retrospective design of our study and
the small number of patients, our results should be interpreted with caution. For instance, an inherent bias was
that patients who received second-line chemotherapy
tended to have a better PS.
The main challenge for the near future is to identify
molecular markers involved in small bowel carcinogenesis
with which to predict chemosensitivity and thus to
improve survival. Targeted therapies such as monoclonal
antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
combined with chemotherapy have already shown significant efficacy in metastatic CRC in first-line treatment and
beyond.23-26 Overman et al observed that a high proportion of SBAs express both EGFR and VEGF, suggesting
that patients with SBA may benefit from therapeutic

1427

Original Article

strategies targeting EGFR and VEGF.27 Of note, KRAS
gene mutations seem less frequent in SBA than in metastatic CRC.26,28 Yet the role of targeted therapies has not
been evaluated in this cancer.
In conclusion, we observed that second-line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI produced disease control in half of
patients with advanced SBA after failure of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the short median
PFS observed in this study should encourage the evaluation of other treatments including targeted therapies.
