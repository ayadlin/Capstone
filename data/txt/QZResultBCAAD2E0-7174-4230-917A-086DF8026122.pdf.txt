Abstract
The multidrug resistance–associated protein 1 (MRP1) has been
closely linked to poor treatment response in several cancers,
most notably neuroblastoma. Homozygous deletion of the MRP1
gene in primary murine neuroblastoma tumors resulted in
increased sensitivity to MRP1 substrate drugs (vincristine,
etoposide, and doxorubicin) compared with tumors containing
both copies of wild-type MRP1, indicating that MRP1 plays a
significant role in the drug resistance in this tumor type and
defining this multidrug transporter as a target for pharmacologic suppression. A cell-based readout system was created to
functionally determine intracellular accumulation of MRP1
substrates using a p53-responsive reporter as an indicator of
drug-induced DNA damage. Screening of small-molecule libraries in this readout system revealed pyrazolopyrimidines as a
prominent structural class of potent MRP1 inhibitors. Reversan,
the lead compound of this class, increased the efficacy of both
vincristine and etoposide in murine models of neuroblastoma
(syngeneic and human xenografts). As opposed to the majority
of inhibitors of multidrug transporters, Reversan was not toxic
by itself nor did it increase the toxicity of chemotherapeutic
drug exposure in mice. Therefore, Reversan represents a new
class of nontoxic MRP1 inhibitor, which may be clinically useful
for the treatment of neuroblastoma and other MRP1-overexpressing drug-refractory tumors by increasing their sensitivity
to conventional chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6573–80]

Introduction
Intrinsic or acquired multidrug resistance is one of the major
causes of treatment failure in human malignancy. Among genes that
mediate multidrug resistance, the clinical relevance of multidrug
resistance–associated protein (MRP1) has been best established in
the aggressive childhood malignancy, neuroblastoma. MRP1 acts as
an ATP-dependent efflux pump for the transport of organic anions,
glutathione-, glucuronate-, or sulfate-conjugated drugs, or unconju-

gated drugs in concert with free glutathione (1, 2), including the
chemotherapeutic agents vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide.
The down-regulation of MRP1 activity in neuroblastoma cells by
MRP1 antisense mRNA (3) or by treatment with MRP1 reversal
agents (4) results in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs. More
importantly, high MRP1 expression in primary neuroblastoma at
diagnosis is strongly associated with poor patient outcome (5, 6).
Thus, identification of inhibitors of this multidrug transporter is of
clinical importance. Although, in recent years, several MRP1
inhibitors have been identified, the number of compounds close to
or entered into clinical trials is limited (e.g., sulindac; ref. 7).
In general, multidrug resistance mediated by multidrug transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and MRP1, results in
resistance to a broad spectrum of structurally unrelated drugs,
and classic inhibitors are substrates of these transporters, reversing
resistance by competitive inhibition. Indeed, many of the first- and
second-generation Pgp inhibitors were such classic inhibitors and
it is believed that this mechanism of action contributed to their
failures (8). During the course of our efforts to identify inhibitors of
p53 (9), we identified a new class of Pgp modulator that did
not globally reverse multidrug resistance but rather altered the
substrate specificity of the transporter (10). This study raised the
possibility of rational control over cell sensitivity to drugs using
these types of modulators that went beyond the classic competitive
inhibition of transporter function. Thus, a small-molecule library
selected around these new Pgp modulators represented a potential
source of novel modulators or inhibitors of other multidrug
transporters, such as MRP1, with unique mechanisms of action.
Through our screening efforts, we have identified six structural
scaffolds that can effectively inhibit MRP1 function with the most
active compounds clustered within the pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold, the focus of the studies presented here. Reversan, one of
the most potent pyrazolopyrimidines identified to date, when
used in combination with either vincristine or etoposide to treat
neuroblastoma in vivo, increased tumor sensitivity to these
conventional drugs with no increased toxicity. Therefore, we
have identified a safe small-molecule inhibitor of MRP1 that may
have clinical potential in the treatment of neuroblastoma and
other cancers that overexpress MRP1.

from Fluka. MK571 was obtained from Calbiochem. Cyclophosphamide was
purchased from Baxter Health Care. Difloxacin was obtained from Abbott
Laboratories. PAK104P was a kind gift from Prof. Shin-Ichi Akiyama
(Kagoshima University). Matrigel basement membrane matrix was obtained

Cell Lines
MCF7 and its derivatives [MCF7/VP (11) and MCF7/VP-LacZ], HCT116
and BE(2)-C and its Pgp-overexpressing derivative BE(2)-C/CHCb(1) (kindly
provided by Dr. Barbara Spengler, Fordham University), were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SK-RC45 was
maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
25 mmol/L HEPES. All media were supplemented with glutamine and
antibiotics. MDCKII, MDCK/MRP1, MDCK/MRP2, and MDCK/MRP3 cells
and the human embryo kidney HEK293, HEK/MRP4, and HEK/MRP5 cells
(kindly provided by Dr. Piet Borst, Netherlands Cancer Institute) were
maintained as described previously (12–14).

Screening of Chemical Libraries
Screening A. A library of 2,300 structural analogues (ChemBridge)
assembled around Pgp modulators identified previously (10) was screened for
MRP1 modulators using a cell-based readout system based on previously
described readout systems that used a p53-responsive LacZ reporter to detect
the presence of DNA damage mediated by doxorubicin (Supplementary
Fig. S1), a substrate for multidrug transporters (9, 10). In the current study, the
human breast cancer cell line MCF7/VP, which has amplified MRP1 and
negligible Pgp, were stably transduced with a p53-responsive LacZ reporter to
create readout cell line, MCF7/VP-p53-LacZ. For screening, MCF7/VP-p53LacZ cells (2  104 per well) were seeded into 96-well plates. The next day,
cells were treated with 0.9 Amol/L doxorubicin in the presence of library
compounds (10 Amol/L). DMSO, doxorubicin alone (0.23-1.8 Amol/L), and 0.9
Amol/L doxorubicin in the presence of verapamil (2.5-20 Amol/L) served as
controls. The following day, reporter activity was measured as described
previously (9). ‘‘Hits’’ were defined as any compounds that increased reporter
activity to a level equal to or greater than the level achieved with 20 Amol/L
verapamil in the absence of direct induction of the p53-responsive reporter by
the compounds themselves (i.e., in the absence of doxorubicin).
Screening B. A library of 299 compounds (ChemBridge) with z90%
structure similarity to active compounds representing six prominent
scaffolds (Supplementary Fig. S2) identified in screening A was screened
as described above.

Drug Accumulation Assay
Select hit compounds were tested for their ability to modulate cellular
accumulation of daunorubicin, a fluorescent MRP1 substrate. MCF7 and
MCF7/VP cells were pretreated with each of the hit compounds for 10 min
before the addition of daunorubicin (0-1.8 Amol/L) for 100 min. Verapamil
and MK571 served as positive controls. Following washing with PBS,
intracellular daunorubicin was eluted with 70% ethanol and the fluorescence measured using 485/535 nm filters (Wallac, Perkin-Elmer).

Cytotoxicity Assays
To determine the effect of the hits on drug sensitivity, MCF7/VP cells
were treated for 18 h with a concentration range of MRP1 substrate drugs
(doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide) or nonsubstrate drugs (cisplatin
and paclitaxel) in the presence or absence of hit compounds. Following the
incubation, medium was replaced and cells were allowed to grow for an
additional 48 h. Cells were then stained with 0.5% methylene blue. Eluted
dye was measured at 600 nm. Fold sensitization was defined as the ratio
between the IC50 of drug alone and the IC50 of drug plus compound. The
same methodology was used to evaluate the effect of the hits on the drug
sensitivity of human tumor cell lines [BE(2)-C, HCT116, and SK-RC45] and
for the evaluation of the effect of modulators on other drug transporters.

Protein Isolation and Western Analysis
Total cell lysates from BE(2)-C, HCT116, SK-RC45, and MCF7/VP were
prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1 PBS, 1% NP-40,

0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma). Proteins were separated on 4% to 15% Tris-HCl gels
(Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated overnight
with a MRP1-specific antibody (MRPr1 1:5,000; Alexis) in TBS containing
0.5% (w/v) skim milk and 2 h with a goat anti-rat secondary antibody
(1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). To control for gel loading, blots were
reprobed for 2 h with an a-tubulin-specific antibody (1:2,000, clone DM1A;
Sapphire Biosciences) in TBS+0.05% Tween 20 and 1 h with a sheep antimouse secondary antibody (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were
visualized using SuperSignal reagent (Progen Biosciences).

Care and Maintenance of Mice
The generation and maintenance of the human MYCN (hMYCN )
transgenic mouse model of neuroblastoma have been described previously
(15, 16). BALB/c mice were obtained from Taconic Farms. Nude mice (nu/nu)
of BALB/c background were obtained from the Biological Resource Facility
of the University of New South Wales. All experimental procedures involving
mice were approved by the University of New South Wales Animal Care and
Ethics Committee according to the Animal Research Act (1985) and the
Australian Code of Practice for Care and Use of Animals for Scientific
Purposes (1997) or the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the Cleveland Clinic Foundation according to the USPHS Policy on Humane
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Establishment of Neuroblastoma Allografts
To determine the influence of MRP1 on drug sensitivity of tumors in vivo,
MRP1 +/+ and MRP1 / murine neuroblastoma tumor cells (5  106/mL)
were resuspended (1:1) with ice-cold Matrigel basement membrane matrix
and the cell suspension (0.2 mL) was injected s.c. into both flanks of mice,
which had been anesthetized with isoflurane. The complete details for the
generation of MRP1 +/+ and MRP1 / tumors are available in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. Mice were monitored daily for 1 week following
injection and tumors were measured every second day using a vernier
caliper. Tumor mass was calculated as described previously (17, 18).

Evaluation of In vivo Toxicity for Reversan Alone and in
Combination with Vincristine
The toxicity of single doses of Reversan (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg
formulated in DMSO) was evaluated via i.p. injection using BALB/c mice.
Mice were monitored >50 days for changes in body weight, mortality, and
morbidity.
To determine whether Reversan altered the toxicity profile of vincristine, 7week-old female BALB/c mice (n z 5 per dose per treatment group) were
treated for 5 consecutive days with vincristine (0.05-0.4 mg/kg) alone or in
combination with 10 mg/kg Reversan. As a positive control, a parallel set of
mice was treated with vincristine in combination with 10 mg/kg cyclosporin
A, a general multidrug transporter inhibitor. Mice were observed for signs of
toxicity for up to 14 days. Mice were weighed daily for 1 week after the start of
treatment. Mice in poor condition (e.g., sunken eyes, ruffled fur, and inactivity)
or with >20% weight loss were euthanized before 14 days.

In vivo Chemotherapeutic Treatment
Following the development of a palpable tumor, hMYCN transgenic mice
(n z 10) were treated daily for 5 consecutive days with single i.p. injections
of vincristine or etoposide in the presence or absence of 10 mg/kg Reversan
(i.p.). Saline and DMSO served as vehicle controls. Mice receiving vincristine
alone or in combination with Reversan were supplemented with paraffin oil
(100 AL) on days 0, 3, and 5 plus 0.1 mg/mL glutamic acid in the drinking
water for 7 days to prevent severe constipation associated with vincristine
in mice. Mice were monitored by experienced technical staff for evidence of
tumor progression by twice weekly abdominal palpations and for visible
changes in overall condition.
For MRP +/+ or MRP / allografts (n z 7 mice per treatment group),
cytotoxic drug treatment commenced as described above when tumors
reached f100 to 125 mm3 in size. Mice were sacrificed when at least
one of its tumors reached 2.5 times its starting mass, which was indicative
of tumor progression. The time to reach 2.5 times the starting volume was
calculated and the saline control was subtracted to give a growth delay

factor. For all efficacy studies, mice were treated with 0.2 mg/kg vincristine
and 6 to 12 mg/kg etoposide depending on the mouse strain.
To determine whether Reversan exacerbated chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia, blood was collected via the saphenous vein of BE(2)-C tumorbearing mice treated with either 9 mg/kg etoposide alone or in combination
with 10 mg/kg Reversan on day 15 following commencement of treatment,
which is the nadir of WBC count following etoposide treatment (19). The
complete blood count was evaluated using a Ac.T diff hematology analyzer
(Beckman Coulter). To ascertain the WBC count composition, whole blood
slides were stained with H&E, coverslipped, and counted using light
microscopy.

Statistical Analysis
Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests were used to test significance
between groups, unless otherwise stated. Fisher’s exact test was used to
compare the survival of mice treated with vincristine in the presence
or absence of modulating agents. Survival analysis was done using
Kaplan-Meier (20) and two-sided log-rank tests. P values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results
Genetic deficiency of MRP1 enhances tumor sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic drugs. To determine the overall contribution of
MRP1 to drug resistance in neuroblastoma, we crossed mice lacking
the MRP1 gene (MRP1 / ) with human hMYCN transgenic mice,
which develop neuroblastoma characteristic of the human disease.
This cross yielded murine neuroblastoma tumors that were either
wild-type (MRP1 +/+) or homozygous null (MRP1 / ) for MRP1 and
thus contained high levels of MRP1 or entirely lacked MRP1,
respectively (Fig. 1A). Tumor cells of either MRP1 genotype were
isolated and established as allografts in nude mice. Tumor-bearing
mice were treated daily for 5 days with vincristine or etoposide, which
are routinely used for the treatment of neuroblastoma patients and
are also known MRP1 substrates, and monitored for tumor growth.
The results of these studies are presented in Fig. 1B. Loss of MRP1
significantly increased the latency of tumor progression in response to
both drugs. In contrast, the lack of MRP1 had no effect on the efficacy
of cisplatin or cyclophosphamide, which are not substrates for MRP1
(data not shown). These data show that MRP1 is a major determinant
of the response of neuroblastoma tumors to chemotherapy.
Identification of compounds inhibiting MRP1. Having
established a direct link between MRP1 and the sensitivity of
neuroblastoma tumors to conventional chemotherapy, we focused
on the identification of small-molecule inhibitors of this multidrug
transporter. As a readout system, we used MRP1-overexpressing cells
that contained a p53-responsive reporter for the detection of a p53
response resulting from the DNA damage induced by the
accumulation of doxorubicin, a known MRP1 substrate, in cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Through our screening efforts, we identified
six chemical scaffolds that functioned as putative MRP1 inhibitors
(Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S2). The most
prominent and selective scaffold identified from the entire screening
process (e.g., screening A and B) was the pyrazolopyrimidine
scaffold, which is represented by CBLC4H10, CBLC4E10, and
CBLC4E11 (Fig. 2). In particular, the pyrazolopyrimidines appeared
to have increased selectivity for MRP1 as shown by the increased
accumulation of the fluorescent MRP1 substrate daunorubicin in
MRP1-overexpressing MCF7/VP cells with little or no effect on MCF7
parental cells (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with another
MRP1 substrate, calcein (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Ability of modulators to sensitize cells to MRP1 substrates.
MRP1 confers resistance to doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide
but not to cisplatin or paclitaxel (21). We therefore tested the three

www.aacrjournals.org

most active pyrazolopyrimidine molecules for their ability to
sensitize MCF7/VP cells to this panel of drugs (Table 1). CBLC4H10,
CBLC4E10, and CBLC4E11 clearly sensitized cells to vincristine
(10- to 15-fold), etoposide (7- to 12-fold), and, to a lesser extent,
doxorubicin (3- to 4-fold). In contrast, these molecules did not
increase sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel. These data suggest
that the effects of these compounds can be attributed to specific
inhibition of MRP1-mediated drug efflux in this cellular context.
The selectivity of the pyrazolopyrimidines for MRP1 in terms of
modulating drug response was further examined by studying the
effects of CBLC4H10 on cell lines overexpressing one of several
other multidrug transporters, including Pgp, MRP2, MRP3,
MRP4, or MRP5. CBLC4H10 did not sensitize MRP2-, MRP3-,
MRP4-, or MRP5-overexpressing cell lines to known substrates of
each of these transporters: vincristine (MRP2), etoposide (MRP3),
or 6-mercaptopurine (MRP4 and MRP5). In contrast, CBLC4H10
significantly sensitized Pgp-overexpressing cells [BE(2)-C/CHCb(1)]
to vincristine (P < 0.0001), indicating that this molecule was not
purely MRP1 specific (data not shown).
Effects of modulators on cytotoxic drug response in tumor
cell lines in vitro. We examined the effects of the pyrazolopyrimidines on the drug response of human neuroblastoma [BE(2)-C],

A, neuroblastoma tumors were harvested from hMYCN transgenic mice that were

MRP1 levels were determined by Western blot. Representative samples from
each MRP1 genotype. MCF7/VP cells, which overexpress MRP1, were used as a
positive control. B, effect of MRP1 status on the sensitivity of neuroblastoma

(0.2 mg/kg) and etoposide (12 mg/kg)] commenced when allografts were f100 to
125 mg in size and continued for 5 consecutive days. The growth delay factor
is the growth delay calculated from 2.5 times the tumor starting volume and
normalized by subtracting the growth delay of the saline controls. The number of
mice per treatment group is as follows: vincristine MRP1 +/+ (n = 8) and MRP1 /
(n = 7) and etoposide MRP1 +/+ (n = 20) and MRP1 / (n = 17). Bars, SE.

renal cell carcinoma (SK-RC45), and colon (HCT116) tumor cell lines,
which represent tumor types that are clinically refractory to cytotoxic
drug treatment as well as containing high levels of MRP1 protein
(Fig. 3A). All three pyrazolopyrimidines caused increased sensitivity
of these three drug-refractory tumor types to one or more cytotoxic
drugs with the most dramatic effect observed in combination with
vincristine (Fig. 3B). Importantly, neither of the compounds selected
showed any effects, within the range of their solubility, on growth or
viability of multiple cell lines tested (data not shown).
Based on our compiled in vitro data for the pyrazolopyrimidines,
compound CBLC4H10 was chosen for further characterization
and development because it was the most effective compound
overall in increasing the sensitivity of drug-resistant MRP1overexpressing tumor cells to conventional chemotherapeutic
agents and thus has potential clinical importance as a modulator

of MRP1. As such, this molecule has been named Reversan to
exemplify its role in reversing drug resistance mediated by MRP1.
Because Reversan represented a new class of MRP1 inhibitor,
we compared the effect of Reversan on etoposide sensitivity in
MCF7/VP cells to a panel of known drug transporter inhibitors,
which included verapamil, cyclosporin A, difloxacin, probenecid,
and PAK104P. Reversan increased the sensitivity of MCF7/VP cells
to etoposide to a level similar to that of PAK104P (25-fold). More
importantly, Reversan was six to eight times more potent than the
rest of the panel of modulators, including the phase I clinical trial
drug, probenecid (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, our compound
is a potential lead for the development of a clinically relevant MRP1
reversal agent.
In vivo efficacy. The toxicity of single i.p. injections of Reversan
(25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) was tested in BALB/c mice. Due to the

mouse is unknown, the toxicity of the 50 and 100 mg/kg doses can
be underestimated to some extent. The 25 mg/kg dose, which
appeared to be completely soluble, was clearly safe for single i.p.
administration.
To determine whether Reversan could effectively increase the
sensitivity of neuroblastoma tumors to conventional chemotherapeutic agents in vivo, we used a transgenic mouse model of this
disease. On the development of a palpable tumor, hMYCN
transgenic mice were treated daily for 5 consecutive days with
vincristine or etoposide alone or in combination with 10 mg/kg
Reversan. Mice were then monitored until signs of tumor
progression were evident. The combination of Reversan with
vincristine (Fig. 4A) or etoposide (Fig. 4B) significantly increased
the survival time of mice compared with those treated with drug
alone. Whereas treatment with vincristine alone increased survival
of tumor-bearing hMYCN mice by f10 days, the addition of
Reversan to the vincristine treatment regimen increased survival
an additional 20 days (survival: 4.9 F 0.49 days saline control,
16.2 F 0.89 days vincristine alone, and 36.5 F 4.4 days vincristine +
Reversan). For treatment with etoposide alone, the duration of
survival of tumor-bearing hMYCN mice doubled compared with
vehicle control and tripled when coadministered with Reversan
(survival: 4.9 F 0.49 days saline control, 11 F 0.67 days etoposide
alone, and 16 F 0.56 days etoposide + Reversan). The combination
of Reversan and cyclophosphamide, which is not a MRP1 substrate,
had no effect on the duration of time between treatment and
progression compared with cyclophosphamide alone (22.8 F
2.2 days cyclophosphamide alone and 27.9 F 2.0 days cyclophosphamide + Reversan; P = 0.115). Reversan also significantly
increased the efficacy of vincristine and etoposide against BE(2)C human neuroblastoma xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S5). It
should also be noted that oral administration of Reversan worked
equally as well as i.p. administration for increasing the efficacy of
etoposide administered to tumor-bearing hMYCN mice.
Effect of Reversan on vincristine toxicity. Past attempts at
modulating multidrug resistance have failed mainly due to
nonspecific side effects that became apparent when modulators
were combined with conventional drugs (22). To determine
whether Reversan increased the toxicity profile of vincristine,
BALB/c mice were treated with vincristine [0.05-0.4 mg/kg, which
includes doses in the clinically relevant range for this drug (23)]

that underwent clinical trials in the 1990s (24, 25). All mice were
followed for up to 14 days for signs of toxicity, such as weight loss,
general poor health, or lethality. We found that Reversan did not
significantly alter the toxicity profile of vincristine (Fig. 4C). In stark
contrast, vincristine administered in combination with 10 mg/kg
cyclosporin A resulted in rapid weight loss and a dramatic shift in
the toxicity profile of vincristine, such that only 0.05 mg/kg
vincristine could be safely given without any adverse side effects.
Neither Reversan nor cyclosporin A was toxic when administered
as individual drugs. Importantly, there was no toxicity associated
with Reversan at clinically relevant doses of vincristine. Similar
results for Reversan were obtained for both males and females in
a second mouse strain, ICR, which shows that lack of toxicity was
not a gender-specific or strain-specific artifact (data not shown).

Figure 4. Efficacy and safety of Reversan. On development of a tumor, hMYCN transgenic mice were treated with conventional chemotherapeutic agents
[0.2 mg/kg vincristine (A ) or 6 mg/kg etoposide (B )] in the presence or absence of 10 mg/kg Reversan daily for 5 consecutive days. Mice were followed until
signs of tumor progression were evident. C, 7-week-old female BALB/c mice [n = 5 per dose per treatment group, except for 0.4 mg/kg vincristine (VCR ) F 10 mg/kg
Reversan, where n = 18 per treatment group], were treated i.p. with 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg vincristine for 5 consecutive days in the presence or absence of 10 mg/kg
Reversan or 10 mg/kg cyclosporin A and observed for signs of toxicity for up to 14 d. Mouse survival per vincristine dose is presented. D, blood was collected
from BE(2)-C tumor-bearing nude mice following treatment with 9 mg/kg etoposide F 10 mg/kg Reversan and analyzed for blood cell parameters, including total WBC,

toxicity following treatment with etoposide alone or in combination with Reversan on day 15, the nadir of WBC count following
etoposide treatment (19). There was no effect of Reversan on the
number of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, or basophils
(Fig. 4D). However, there was a significant increase (f2-fold;
P = 0.027) in the number of neutrophils in mice treated with the
drug combination compared with mice treated with etoposide
alone. Thus, Reversan appeared to have a protective effect on the
neutrophil population and does not enhance etoposide-induced
neutropenia. There was no significant effect of the etoposide/
Reversan combination on the platelet population (data not shown).

Discussion
One of the major problems in the fight against cancer is the
intrinsic or acquired resistance of tumors to current cancer
treatments. Although many mechanisms of resistance exist, the
majority of clinical and experimental data indicate that multidrug
transporters, which keep intracellular drug concentrations low (e.g.,
Pgp and MRP1), play a leading role in treatment failure (8). Thus,
inhibition of the function of these drug efflux pumps in tumor cells
presents one of the most promising approaches to cure cancer
using existing chemotherapy. This approach is not a new strategy;
however, the clinical failures of early Pgp inhibitors significantly

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

diminished the enthusiasm of drug developers. Nevertheless,
drug resistance associated with multidrug transporters remains a
serious problem and the development of inhibitors against these
proteins must be revisited using the knowledge and experience
gained from past failures to increase the likelihood of success.
For instance, first-generation Pgp inhibitors had lower affinity to
Pgp than to other target proteins (e.g., verapamil and Ca2+ channel)
and thus could not be administered at sufficiently high doses to
inhibit Pgp without causing toxicity through high-affinity targets
(8). Second-generation Pgp modulators, although more specific,
had the potential to change the pharmacokinetics of conventional
chemotherapy agents by altering their metabolism and clearance
from the body presumably through interactions with cytochrome
P450 (e.g., valspodar; refs. 26–28), which often shares substrates
with Pgp. Therefore, such inhibitors competed with the conventional drugs for metabolism as well as for efflux (29, 30).
Currently, third-generation Pgp inhibitors (e.g., tariquidar and
zosuquidar) have reached various stages of clinical investigation (8).
These molecules are potent, highly specific Pgp inhibitors that are
not themselves substrates of this transporter (31–33), which suggests
that pharmacokinetic interactions may not be an issue. Indeed, early
clinical trials showed that tariquidar could reverse drug efflux in
patients (34, 35) and be coadministered with paclitaxel, vinorelbine,
or doxorubicin without the need for dose reduction of the

chemotherapeutic agents (8). It should be noted that several, more
recent clinical trials with tariquidar have been prematurely ended
(phase II or III in breast and lung cancer) due to low efficacy or
increased toxicity in the tariquidar containing treatment arm (36).
Therefore, optimization of dose, scheduling, and drug combinations
are still required and additional phase II clinical trials are ongoing. In
clinical trials with zosuquidar, only modest pharmacokinetic drug
interactions have been observed to date and at the same time
increased antitumor activity of conventional agents in previous
drug-refractory tumors (37–40). Therefore, multidrug transporter
modulators have renewed clinical potential.
Although the present study was focused predominantly on
neuroblastoma, MRP1 has been associated with poor treatment
response not only in neuroblastoma but also in both non-small cell
and small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer (41).
Thus, identification of clinically relevant inhibitors of MRP1 would
have broad applications in the treatment of drug-refractory
tumors. In this report, we have established conclusively that
MRP1 plays a role in resistance to conventional chemotherapy
in vivo. Consequently, we set out to identify MRP1 inhibitors that
were safe by themselves and did not significantly affect the
pharmacokinetic properties of conventional agents, two critical
characteristics based on the history of Pgp inhibitor development.
We have found such an inhibitor in Reversan. Because the majority
of ‘‘failed’’ Pgp inhibitors ( first- and second-generation) were
substrates and competed with the conventional agents for
transport by Pgp and possibly CYP3A4, we reasoned that, if we
could identify inhibitors of MRP1 that were not themselves
substrates of the transporter, we might increase the likelihood of
identifying molecules that did not interfere with the pharmacokinetics of the conventional agents. Therefore, we hypothesized that
screening of a library of compounds selected around the structural
features of previously identified Pgp modulators, which were
determined not to be Pgp substrates, would lead to the
identification of MRP1 inhibitors with novel mechanisms of
action, that is, nonsubstrate/noncompetitive inhibitors of MRP1
function. We have independently confirmed that Reversan is not a
substrate for MRP1 by showing that similar levels of [3H]Reversan
accumulate in MCF7 and MCF7/VP cells despite the increased level
of MRP1 in the latter cell line due to gene amplification. Currently,
the exact mechanism of action of Reversan and related pyrazolopyrimidines is unknown. Because the original Pgp modulators
around which the screening library was generated are not ATPase
inhibitors, it is likely that the pyrazolopyrimidines are also not
inhibitors of ATPase, but this remains to be tested. It is possible that
Reversan does not interact directly with MRP1 or Pgp but rather

alters the physicochemical properties of the membrane surrounding
the transporter, which could then alter the structure of the
protein(s) within the membrane and affect its ability to transport.
Indeed, it appears that the hydrophobic nature of Reversan and the
other similarly active pyrazolopyrimidines may be important for
their potency because more hydrophilic pyrazolopyrimidine
analogues (logP <4 versus 4.92 for Reversan) were less effective in
reversing drug resistance (Supplementary Table S1).
Although some critics of this field have suggested that inhibitors
of multidrug transporters should be specific for individual transporters or toxicity would be increased due to inhibition of offtarget transporters, the results of the current study suggest that this
is not the case for Reversan. Despite the fact that Reversan inhibits
the function of both MRP1 and Pgp equally well, it does not
significantly alter the toxicity profile of conventional chemotherapeutic agents in vivo in contrast to cyclosporin A, which
exemplifies the earlier generation of toxic multidrug transporter
modulators. Perhaps the problem of off-target toxicities is not
related to interactions with other transporters but more related to
interplay between Pgp and CYP3A4 in terms of shared substrates
(29, 30). The increase in the effectiveness of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents observed with Reversan in the absence
of an increased toxicity of these conventional agents indicates that
Reversan has an excellent therapeutic index compared with
multidrug inhibitors of the past. Thus, it appears that Reversan
represents a new class of ‘‘safe’’ multidrug transporter inhibitor
that may be clinically useful in the treatment of neuroblastoma and
other cancers associated with aberrant MRP1/Pgp expression.
