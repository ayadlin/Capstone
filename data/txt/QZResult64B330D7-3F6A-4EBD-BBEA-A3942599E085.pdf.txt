ABSTRACT
Carbonylation is a posttranslational modification (PTM or PTLM), where a
carbonyl group is added to lysine (K), proline (P), arginine (R), and threonine (T)
residue of a protein molecule. Carbonylation plays an important role in orchestrating
various biological processes but it is also associated with many diseases such as
diabetes, chronic lung disease, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, chronic
renal failure, and sepsis. Therefore, from the angles of both basic research and drug
development, we are facing a challenging problem: for an uncharacterized protein
sequence containing many residues of K, P, R, or T, which ones can be carbonylated,
and which ones cannot? To address this problem, we have developed a predictor
called iCar-PseCp by incorporating the sequence-coupled information into the general
pseudo amino acid composition, and balancing out skewed training dataset by Monte
Carlo sampling to expand positive subset. Rigorous target cross-validations on a same
set of carbonylation-known proteins indicated that the new predictor remarkably
outperformed its existing counterparts. For the convenience of most experimental
scientists, a user-friendly web-server for iCar-PseCp has been established at http://
www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iCar-PseCp, by which users can easily obtain their desired results
without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.
It has not escaped our notice that the formulation and approach presented here can
also be used to analyze many other problems in computational proteomics.

INTRODUCTION

identifying the possible modified sites in proteins (see, e.g.,
[5–13]), DNA [14, 15], and RNA sequences [16, 17]. For
a systematic introduction about this, see two recent review
articles [13, 15].
In vivo, PTM is one of the most efficient biological
mechanisms for regulating physiology as well as for
expanding the genetic code. But when body’s well-designed
proteolysis or other repair systems are overwhelmed by
excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) [18], the oxidative
stress may occur [18], weakening the damage-repairing
ability. This may also bring about varieties of PTMs on

Cancer and many other major diseases are often
caused by varieties of subtle modifications in biological
sequences, typically by various types of post-translational
modification (PTM or PTLM) in protein [1, 2], postreplication modification (PTRM) in DNA [3] and posttranscription modification (PTCM) in RNA [4]. In
order to reveal the pathological mechanisms of these
diseases and find new and revolutionary strategies to treat
them, considerable efforts have been made in order for

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

proteins, including nitration, carbonylation, sulfhydration
and glutathionylation [19]. Among these PTMs, the
protein carbonylation has been used as a biomarker for
severe oxidative protein damage due to its relative early
formation, stability, and irreversibility [20, 21]. Actually,
protein carbonylation is an early stage of diseases induced
by external oxidative stress, aging and obesity [22, 23].
It may cause numerous major human diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease,
chronic renal failure, chronic lung disease, sepsis and so
forth [24, 25]. Therefore, the information of carbonylation
sites in proteins is indispensable not only for in-depth
understanding many important biological processes but also
for precisely aiming targets in developing effective drugs
against the aforementioned diseases.
Mass spectrometry is one of the most common
techniques to analyze the carbonyl level of a protein
and determine its carbonylation sites [26, 27]. So far
four types of amino acid residues have been found more
prone to carbonylation; they are lysine (K), proline (P),
arginine (R), and threonine (T) [24, 28–30]. But it would
take much longer time and need more labors to utilize the
conventional experimental techniques alone to determine
the carbonylation sites in proteins [27, 31]. Facing the
rapid growth of biological sequences, we are challenged to
develop automated methods as a complimentary approach
to experimental methods.
Actually, some investigators have made efforts to do
so. Maisonneuve et al. [29], based on their spectrometry
analysis, proposed some empirical rules to identify the hot
spots of carbonylation. Recently, Lv et al. [32] and Xu et al.
[33] developed two different bioinformatical tools to
predict the protein carbonylation sites. These methods did
have contribution in stimulating the development of this
area. Since the topic’s importance as well as the urgency of
demanding more powerful high throughput tools in this area,
further efforts aiming at prediction of protein carbonylation
sites are definitely needed.
Here, we are to develop a new and more powerful
predictor by (1) using the Monte Carlo sampling approach to
optimize the training dataset, (2) incorporating the vectorized
sequence-coupling model into the general PseAAC, and (3)
installing the random forest (RF) algorithm to operate the
prediction system.
As shown in many recent relevant papers [11, 12,
14, 17, 34–40], to establish a biological sequence-based
statistical predictor that not only can be easily used by most
experimental scientists to get their desired results but also can
inspirely stimulate theoretical scientists to create various other
prediction methods, we should observe the Chou’s 5-step rules
or guidelines [41]: (1) benchmark dataset preparation; (2)
mathematical representation of biological sequence samples;
(3) calculation algorithm; (4) cross-validation; (5) web-server
establishment. Below, let us to address the five guidelines oneby-one. To match the rubric style of the Oncotarget journal,
however, the order in addressing them may be changed.

A novel web-server predictor and its user guide
A new and more powerful predictor, called iCarPseCp, has been established for predicting the protein
carbonylation sites. Moreover, to maximize users’
convenience, the point-to-point instructions are given below.
(1) Click the web-server at http://www.jci-bioinfo.
cn/iCar-PseCp, the top page of the iCar-PseCp will be
prompted on your computer screen (Figure 1).
(2) In the input box (Figure 1), enter your query
protein sequences, which can be done by either typing
or copying/pasting manner. The entered query protein
sequences should be in the FASTA format. Not familiar
with FASTA? Just click the button of Example.
(3) You can see the prediction results by clicking
the Submit button. If you use the Sequence_K in the
Example window as the input and check on the K button,
after 15 seconds or so since your submitting, you will see
the following on your screen: Sequence_K contains 9 K
residues, of which 5 are predicted to be of carbonylation site
and they are at the sequence positions 2, 14, 41, 68 and 95.
If you use the Sequence_P as the input and check on the
P button, you will see: Sequence_P contains 10 P residues,
of which 5 are of carbonylation site and at positions 95,
122, 142, 145, and 149. If you use the Sequence_R as the
input and check on the R button, you will see: Sequence_R
contains 8 R residues, of which 3 are of carbonylation
site and at the positions 14, 41, and 75. If you use the
Sequence T as the input and check on the T button, you
will see: Sequence_T contains 7 T residues, of which 1 is
of carbonylation site and at the positions 14. Compared with
experimental observations, the above (9 + 10 + 8 + 7) = 34
predicted results contain no false positive result ( N -+ = 0 )
but 5 false positive results ( N +− = 5) , which are the
2nd and 13th K residues in sequence_K, the 142th and
145th P residues in sequence_P, and the 75th R residue
in sequence_R. In other words, the total number of
carbonylation sites involved in the above predictions is
N+ = 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 8, while the total number of noncarbonylation sites investigated is N− = 6 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 25.
Substituting these data into Eq.9, we have Sn = 100%,
Sp = 80.00% and Acc = 84.80%, and MCC = 0.7018, quite
consistent with the rates reported in Table 1 via the rigorous
cross validation on the 250 benchmark proteins.
(4) If you have a lot of query protein sequences and
need a lot of computational time, you can choose to use
the batch prediction. To do so, just use the Browse button
to select the desired file (in FASTA format of course) and
follow the online instruction.

available by clicking the button of Supporting Information
on the top of Figure 1.

and CarSpred [32]. In Figure 2 the red and green graphic
lines are the ROC curves for the PTMPred and CarSpred,
respectively; while the blue graphic line for the proposed
predictor iCar-PseCp. The greater the area under the AUC is,
the better the predictor will be [52–53]. As we can see from
Figure 2, the area under the blue curve is remarkably greater
than that under the red or green line, once again indicating
that the proposed predictor is indeed much better than
PTMPred and CarSpred predictors. Therefore, iCAR-PseCp
will become a very useful bioinformatics tool for relevant
basic research and drug development as well.
Why can the proposed method enhance the prediction
quality so significantly? First, the coupling effects among
the amino acids around the carbonylation sites are taken
into account via the conditional probability approach,
which has been proved to be indeed very useful in a
series of previous studies [57–60]. Second, the predictor
is trained by a balanced benchmark dataset via Monte
Carlo sampling, and hence many false prediction events
as occurring in the cases of PTMPred [33] and CarSpred
[32] trained by very imbalanced and skewed datasets can
be completely avoided.

The success scores achieved by the iCar-PseCp
predictor via the 10-fold target cross validation for K-,
P-, R-, and T-type carbonylation are shown in Table 1.
Meanwhile, the corresponding rates by PTMPred [33] and
CarSpred [32] are also listed there. As we can see from
Table 1, compared with its counterparts, although the Acc
values obtained by the iCar-PseCp are within the ± 4%, its
Sn and Sp values are more than 20% and 5–9% higher than
those by PTMPred and CarSpred, indicating that the results
predicted by the previous methods [33–34] contain much
more false negative and positive events. Particularly, the
MCC values achieved by iCar-PseCp are about 2 or 3 times
higher than those of its counterparts, indicating that the new
proposed predictor is significantly more stable.
Graphical approach is a useful vehicle for analyzing
complicated biological systems as demonstrated by a
series of previous studies (see, e.g., [42–51]. Here, to
provide an intuitive comparison, the graph of Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) [52, 53] was utilized to
show the advantage of iCar-PseCp over the PTMPred [33]

MATERIALS AND METHODS

230 + 20 = 250 protein sequences used by [32], and
collected were only those peptide segments that have K, P,
R, and T at the center. (2) If the upstream or downstream
in a protein sequence was less than ξ or greater than L−ξ
where L is the length of the protein sequence concerned,
the lacking amino acid was filled with a dummy residue
X. (3) The peptide segment samples thus obtained were
put into the positive subset  ξ+ (  ) if their centers have
been experimentally annotated as the carbonylation sites;
−
otherwise, into the negative subset  ξ (  ) . (4) Using the
CD-HIT software [75], the aforementioned samples were
further subject to a screening procedure to winnow those
that had ≥ 30% pairwise sequence identity to any other in a
same subset.
Note that the length of peptide samples and their
number thus generated would depend on the ξ value.
But preliminary tests had indicated that it would be
most promising when ξ = 7 or the sample’s length was
2ξ + 1 = 15. Accordingly, hereafter we only consider
the case of ξ = 7; i.e., the samples with 15 amino acid
residues. Thus, the benchmark datasets thus obtained for
 ξ= 7 ( K ) ,  ξ= 7 ( P ) ,  ξ= 7 ( R ) , and  ξ= 7 ( S) are given in
Supporting Information S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively.
Listed in Table 2 is a summary of their sizes.

Benchmark dataset
The data used in the current study was derived
from the 230 carbonylated protein sequences from human
[26, 61–67] and 20 carbonylated protein sequences from
Photobacterium and Escherichia coli [29, 63, 68, 69].
For facilitating description later, the Chou’s peptide
formulation was adopted. It was used for studying
enzyme specificity [57], signal peptide cleavage sites [70],
hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine sites [8], methylation
sites [7], nitrotyrosine sites [9], protein-protein interaction
[71], and protein-protein binding sites [72]. According to
Chou’s scheme, a potential carbonylation site-containing
peptide sample can be generally expressed by
Pξ () = R − ξ R − ( ξ −1)  R −2 R −1  R +1R +2  R + ( ξ −1) R + ξ  (1)
where the symbol  denotes the single amino acid code
K, P, R, or T, the subscript ξ is an integer, R−ξ represents
the ξ-th upstream amino acid residue from the center, the
R+ξ the ξ-th downstream amino acid residue, and so forth.
The (2ξ + 1) -tuple peptide sample Pξ(  ) can be further
classified into the following two categories:
+
P (  ) , if its center is a carbonylation site
Pξ (  ) ∈  ξ−
(2)
other wisse
Pξ (  ) ,

Incorporate sequence-coupled information into
general pseudo amino acid composition

where P (  ) denotes a true carbonylation segment with
K, P, R, or T at its center, Pξ− (  ) a false segment with K,
P, R, or T at its center, and the symbol ∈ means “a member
of” in the set theory.
In literature the benchmark dataset usually consists
of a training dataset and a testing dataset: the former is
used for training a model, while the latter for testing the
model. But as pointed out in a comprehensive review [73],
there is no need to artificially separate a benchmark dataset
into the two parts if the prediction model is examined by
the jackknife test or subsampling (K-fold) cross-validation
since the outcome thus obtained is actually from a
combination of many different independent dataset tests.
Thus, the benchmark dataset  ξ � (  ) for the current study
can be formulated as

With the avalanche of biological sequence generated
in the post-genomic age, one of the most important
problems in computational biology is how to formulate a
biological sequence with a discrete model or a vector, yet
still considerably keep its sequence order information or
essential feature. This is because all the existing machinelearning algorithms can only handle vector but not sequence
samples, as elaborated in [15].
To address this problem, the pseudo amino acid
composition [76, 77] or PseAAC was proposed. Ever since
the concept of pseudo amino acid composition or Chou’s
PseAAC [78–80] was proposed, it has rapidly penetrated into
many biomedicine and drug development areas [81–83] and
nearly all the areas of computational proteomics (see, e.g.,
[84–91] as well as a long list of references cited in [92, 93]).
Because it has been widely and increasingly used,
recently three powerful open access soft-wares, called
‘PseAAC-Builder’ [78], ‘propy’ [79], and ‘PseAAC-General’
[92], were established: the former two are for generating
various modes of Chou’s special PseAAC; while the 3rd one
for those of Chou’s general PseAAC [41], including not only
all the special modes of feature vectors for proteins but also
the higher level feature vectors such as “Functional Domain”
mode (see Eqs.9–10 of [41]), “Gene Ontology” mode (see
Eqs.11–12 of [41]), and “Sequential Evolution” or “PSSM”
mode (see Eqs.13–14 of [41]). Inspired by the successes of
using PseAAC to deal with protein/peptide sequences, three
web-servers [94–96] were developed for generating various

feature vectors for DNA/RNA sequences. Particularly,
recently a powerful web-server called Pse-in-One [97] has
been developed that can be used to generate any desired
feature vectors for protein/peptide and DNA/RNA sequences
according to the need of users’ studies.
According to the general PseAAC [41], the peptide
sequence of Eq.1 can be formulated as
Pξ = 7 (  ) = Pξ+= 7 (  ) − Pξ−= 7 (  ) 

All these probability values can be easily derived from
the positive training subsets taken from Supporting
Information S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively as done in
[98]. Likewise, the components in Eq.6 are the same as
those in Eq.5 except for that they are derived from the
corresponding negative training subsets therein.

Expanding positive samples by Monte Carlo
approach
As we can see from the Supporting Information S1,
−
S2, S3, and S4, the negative subset  ξ (  ) in each of them
is much larger than its corresponding positive one  ξ+ (  ) in
number of samples. Although this might reflect the real world
in which the non-carbonylation sites are always the majority
compared with the carbonylation ones, a predictor trained by
such a highly skewed benchmark dataset would inevitably
have the bias consequence that many carbonylation sites
might be mispredicted as non-carbonylation ones. Therefore,
it is important to find an effective approach to minimize this
kind of bias consequence. To realize this, we adopted the
Monte Carlo simulation [99, 100] to expand the samples of
positive subset. The concrete procedures are as follows.
Step 1. Suppose Pi () (i = −7, −6, … , −1, +1, …,
+6, +7; i ≠ 0) is the probability of the 20 native amino acids
occurring at the i-th position of the carbonylation samples
that can be derived from a training dataset in the positive
subsets of Supporting Information S1, S2, S3, or S4,
respectively.
Step 2. For simplicity, let us formulate the
probability thus obtained according to the alphabetical
order of the single-letter code of the 20 native amino acids
(note that the dummy amino acid X introduced in the
Benchmark Dataset section was treated as the 21st amino
acid); i.e.,

In Eq.5 p (R −7 | R −6 ) ) is the conditional probability

p−+6 (R −6 | R −5 ) is the conditional probability of amino acid
R−6 occurring at the left 2nd position given that its closest
right neighbor is R−5, and so forth. Note that in Eq.5, only
p−+1 (R −1 ) and p++1 (R +1 ) are of non-conditional probability
since the right neighbor of R−1 and the left neighbor of R+1
are always  (namely Lys, Pro, Arg, or Thr, respectively).

e.g., [106]). Unfortunately, the conventional formulations
for the four are not intuitive and that most experimental
scientists feel difficult to understand them, particularly
for the one of MCC. Interestingly, by using the Chou’s
symbols and derivation in studying signal peptides [107],
the aforementioned four metrics can be easily converted into
a set of following equations [5, 35]:

then the k-th amino acid is drawn for an expanded positive
sample at its i-th subsite. For example, if k = 2 and i = −7,
then the amino acid thus drawn should be C for the left 1st
sequence position (cf. Eq.1); if k = 19 and i = −6, then the
amino acid drawn should be W for the left 2nd sequence
position; if k = 20 and i = +7, then the amino acid drawn
should be Y for the right last sequence position; and so
forth.
Step 4. Repeat the above steps until the number of
positive (the original plus the expanded) samples is the
same as the negative samples.
At first glance, the rationale of the above Monte Carlo
sampling procedure seems like a circular argument. But it
is correct as elucidated in [54]. Particularly, these expanded
positive samples were used only for training a model but not
used for testing it, as well be further discussed later.

where N+ represents the total number of carbonylation sites
investigated whereas N −+ the number of true carbonylation
sites incorrectly predicted to be of non-carbonylation
site; N− the total number of the non-carbonylation sites
investigated whereas N +− the number of non-carbonylation
sites incorrectly predicted to be of carbonylation site.
According to Eq.9, it is crystal clear to see the
following. When N −+ = 0 meaning none of the true
carbonylation sites are incorrectly predicted to be of noncarbonylation site, we have the sensitivity Sn = 1. When N −+
= N+ meaning that all the carbonylation sites are incorrectly
predicted to be of non-carbonylation site, we have the
sensitivity Sn = 0. Likewise, when N +− = 0 meaning none of
the non-carbonylation sites are incorrectly predicted to be of
carbonylation site, we have the specificity Sp = 1; whereas
N +− = N− meaning that all the non-carbonylation sites are
incorrectly predicted to be of carbonylation sites, we have
the specificity Sp = 0. When N −+ = N +− = 0 meaning that
none of carbonylation sites in the positive dataset and none
of the non-carbonylation sites in the negative dataset are
incorrectly predicted, we have the overall accuracy Acc = 1
and MCC = 1; when N −+ = N+ and N +− = N− meaning that
all the carbonylation sites in the positive dataset and all the
non-carbonylation sites in the negative dataset are incorrectly
predicted, we have the overall accuracy Acc = 0 and
MCC = −1; whereas when N −+ = N+/2 and N +− = N−/2
we have Acc = 0.5 and MCC = 0 meaning no better than
random guess. Therefore, using Eq.9 has made the meanings
of sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and Mathew’s
correlation coefficient much more intuitive and easierto-understand, particularly for the meaning of MCC, as
concurred recently by many investigators (see, e.g., [14, 16,
38, 39, 71, 72, 108–113]).
Note that, however, the set of equations defined
in Eq.9 is valid only for the single-label systems. For
the multi-label systems whose emergence has become
more frequent in system biology [114–116] and system

The random forests (RF) algorithm is a powerful
algorithm and has been used in many areas of computational
biology (see, e.g. [11, 12, 71, 72, 101−104]). The detailed
procedures of RF and its formulation have been very clearly
described in [105], and hence there is no need to repeat here.
For the current study, all the involved peptide samples
were converted into a 14-D (dimensional) vector according
to Eq.4, and then entered into the RF operation engine as
the input. And the output would indicate whether the center
residue  of the query peptide is a “carbonylation site” or
“non- carbonylation site”. Note that, in using the current
prediction method, one must observe the self-consistency
principle: if the center residue of a query peptide is  = K
then the corresponding training data must be taken from
 ξ= 7 ( K ) if the center residue of a query peptide is  =
P, then the training data must be taken from and  ξ= 7 ( P ) ;
and so forth (see Eq.3).
The predictor established via the above procedures is
called “pCar-PseCp”, where “i” stands for identify”, “Car”
for “carbonylation site”, “Pse” for “general PseAAC”, and
“Cp” for “sequence coupled effect”.
As pointed out in the Introduction section, one of the
keys in establishing a useful predictor is how to properly
evaluate its anticipated success rates. To realize this, we need
to consider the following two things: one is what metrics
or scales should be adopted to quantitatively measure its
prediction quality; the other is what validation method
should be utilized to calculate or derive the metrics values.
Below, we are to address the two problems.

A set of four metrics
The following four metrics are usually used in
literature to measure the quality of binary classification: (1)
overall accuracy or Acc; (2) Mathew’s correlation coefficient
or MCC; (3) sensitivity or Sn; and (4) specificity or Sp (see,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

0 ≤ Sn ≤ 1

medicine [117], a completely different set of metrics are
needed as elaborated in [118].

Step 3. Based on the training dataset, use Eqs.4–6
to derive the sequence-coupled information. Also, based
on the same training dataset, use Monte Carlo sampling to
expand its positive subset making it have the same size as
the negative subset.
Step 4. Use the sequence-coupled information and
the expanded training dataset obtained in Step 3 to train the
model and perform the prediction for each of the samples
in the testing dataset.
Step 5. Repeat Steps 2–4 until all the 10 divided sets
had been singled out one-by-one for testing validation.
Step 6. Substituting the average scores obtained from
the above 10-round tests into Eq.9 to calculate Sn, Sp, Acc,
and MCC.
It is crystal clear to see from the above steps that
the validation was made only for experiment-confirmed
samples, and that none of information from the testing
datasets was ever used to train the predictor.

Target cross-validation
With a good set of metrics to measure the predictor’s
quality, the next thing to consider is what kind of validation
method should be adopted to calculate the metrics values.
The following three cross-validation methods are
often used in statistics to derive the metrics values for
a predictor: independent dataset test, subsampling (or
K-fold cross-validation) test, and jackknife test [119].
Among these three, however, the jackknife test is deemed
the least arbitrary that can always yield a unique outcome
for a given benchmark dataset as elucidated in [41] and
demonstrated by Eqs.28–32 therein. Accordingly, the
jackknife test has been widely recognized and increasingly
used by investigators to examine the quality of various
predictors (see, e.g., [84–87, 120–127]). However, to
reduce the computational time, in this study we adopted
the K-fold cross-validation, as done by most investigators
with SVM and random forests algorithms as the prediction
engine.
When conducting the K-fold cross-validation for
the current predictor iCAR-PseCp, however, some special
consideration is needed. This is because a dataset, after
expanding by Monte Carlo sampling, may contain many
hypothetical positive samples. It would be fine to use
such an expanded dataset to train a prediction model, but
certainly not for validation. This is because the validation
should be made on a testing dataset that only contains
experiment-confirmed samples without any added
hypothetical samples [14, 104]. To ensure this, a special
cross-validation, the so-called target cross-validation [113],
has been introduced here. During the target cross-validation
process, only the experiment-confirmed samples are picked
out from the testing dataset for validating and scoring [11].
The detailed procedures of the target K-fold cross-validation
(without losing the generality, let us consider K = 10) can be
described as follows.
Step 1. Before expanding the positive samples, both
the original positive and negative subsets were randomly
divided into 10 parts with about the same size. For example,
for  ξ= 7 ( K ) in Supporting Information S1, after such
evenly division we have


CONCLUSIONS
The iCar-PseCp predictor is a new bioinformatics
tool for identifying the carbonylation sites in proteins.
Compared with the existing predictors in this area, its
prediction quality is much better, with remarkably more
stability and less false predictions. For the convenience of
most experimental scientists, we have provided its webserver and a step-by-step guide, by which users can easily
obtain their desired results without the need to go through
the detailed mathematics. The reason of including them in
this paper is for the integrity of the new prediction method,
and that these techniques, such as sequence-coupled
approach and Monte Carlo sampling, may be of use as well
in developing other tools in computational biology.
We anticipate that iCar-PseCp will become a
very useful high throughput tool, or at the very least, a
complementary tool to the existing methods for predicting
the protein carbonylation sites.
