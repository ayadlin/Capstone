ABSTRACT
We analysed the prognostic significance of minimal residual disease (MRD)
level in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated in the randomized
gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) ALFA-0701 trial.
Levels of WT1 and NPM1 gene transcripts were assessed using cDNA-based realtime quantitative PCR in 183 patients with WT1 overexpression and in 77 patients
with NMP1 mutation (NPM1mut) at diagnosis.
Positive WT1 MRD (defined as > 0.5% in the peripheral blood) after induction
and at the end of treatment were both significantly associated with a higher risk of
relapse and a shorter overall survival (OS). Positive NPM1mut MRD (defined as >
0.1% in the bone marrow) after induction and at the end of treatment also predicted
a higher risk of relapse, but did not influence OS. Interestingly, the achievement of
a negative NPM1mut MRD was significantly more frequent in patients treated in the
GO arm compared to those treated in control arm (39 % versus 7% (p=0.006) after
induction and 91% versus 61% (p=0.028) at the end of treatment). However, GO did
not influence WT1 MRD levels.
Our study supports the prognostic significance of MRD assessed by WT1 and
NPM1mut transcript levels and show that NPM1 MRD is decreased by GO treatment.

(ELN) therapeutic recommendations in patients with
chronic myeloid leukemia [1]. MRD assessment is also
becoming a routine procedure for treatment stratification
in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [2]. In AML
patients, many studies have highlighted the prognostic
value of MRD detection both after chemotherapy and in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the pre-/post-transplant setting [3], but the use of MRD as
a decision making tool has been introduced more recently
[4, 5].
Two different sensitive methods, real-time
quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) and multiparameter flow
cytometry (MFC), can be used to monitor MRD in
6281

AML patients. Chimeric fusion genes, such as PMLRARA, RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFβ-MYH11, are reliable
markers for MRD evaluation by RQ-PCR. However these
markers are present in only 20-25% of AML cases. As
nucleophosmin 1 gene mutations (NPM1mut) is a frequent
marker, present in 30% of all AML patients and in 50% of
those with normal karyotype, mutation-specific RQ-PCR
assays have been developed for MRD monitoring [6-10].
RQ-PCR analysis of the Wilms’ Tumor 1 gene
(WT1), which is overexpressed in 70-90% AML cases
[11], represents another informative marker in patients
lacking specific molecular marker.
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an antibody-drug
conjugate targeting the CD33 antigen linked to a cytotoxic
derivative of the calicheamicin family of antitumor
antibiotics. In the ALFA-0701 trial, we randomly evaluated
the addition of fractionated doses of GO to standard-dose

induction chemotherapy in patients aged 50 to 70 years old
with de novo AML. Although complete remission (CR)
rate was not significantly different between the control
arm and the GO arm, 2 years event free survival (EFS) and
2 years overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in
patients treated with GO (41% versus 17% and 53% versus
42%, respectively) [12]. In a recent study, we showed that
independent predictors of shorter OS in ALFA-0701 study
were unfavorable karyotype and SNP-A lesion(s) in the
whole cohort, and SNP-A lesion(s), DNMT3A mutations
and randomization in the control arm in AML with normal
karyotype [13].
Throughout this study, NPM1mut and WT1
transcript levels were prospectively assessed at pre-defined
time-points. Here, we report on the correlation between
MRD response and patient’s outcome and the effect of GO
on MRD levels.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Among the 278 patients analysed in the study,
183 (66%) had an overexpression of WT1, defined by a
WT1/100ABL ratio at AML diagnosis above 5% in PB and/
or above 25% in BM. There were 91 patients in control
group and 92 patients in GO group. Main characteristics
were well balanced between the two arms (Table 1).
Ninety-three patients /278 (33%) had NPM1mut AML of
which 79 had a mutation type A, B or D (42 patients in the
GO arm, 37 patients in control arm). Main characteristics
were well balanced, except for FLT3-ITD mutation which
was more frequent in the control arm (Table 1). The
number of MRD samples available in each treatment arm

samples with NPM1 mutation were analysed. The ratio
NPM1mut/100 ABL transcripts was - 0.30 log lower in PB
than in BM samples (-1.20 to 0.60) (Figure 2B). Among
the 125 paired samples, 23 (18%) were discrepant with
a positive MRD in BM but not in PB in 19/23 (82%)
cases. We chose to analyse only BM samples for MRD
monitoring based on NPM1 mutations [14].

is summarized in the flow-chart (Figure 1).

Concordance in paired bone marrow and
peripheral blood samples
Two hundred and thirty six BM and PB paired
samples of MRD were analysed in patients with WT1
overexpression. The WT1/100 ABL ratio was - 0.71 log
lower in PB as compared to BM samples (95% limits of
agreement: -2.10 to 0.68) (Figure 2A). Among the 236
paired samples, 27 (11%) showed a discordant result,
with a positive MRD in PB but not in BM samples in
18/27 (67%) cases. Due to this result and to the higher
background level of WT1 expression in BM samples, we
decided to analyse only PB samples for MRD monitoring
based on WT1 transcript levels.

Prognostic impact of MRD after induction
therapy
In the 104 patients who achieved a CR or CRp, a
positive WT1 MRD after induction was associated with
a higher cause-specific hazard of relapse (HR=3.15
[1.78 – 5.58], p<0.0001). The cumulative incidence
of relapse at 24 months was 74% (95%CI: [52 - 87%])
for 31 patients with positive MRD and 38% [26 - 50%]

for 73 patients with negative MRD (Figure 3A). When
adjusted for cytogenetics, randomization arm, NPM1mut
and   FLT3-ITD  status, a positive  WT1  MRD remained
independently associated with the cause-specific hazard
of relapse (HR=2.45, [1.26 – 4.76], p=0.0084). These
results translated to a shorter OS from CR (HR=3.23 [1.64
– 6.37], p=0.0007) in patients with a positive WT1 MRD
after induction. However, when adjusted for cytogenetics,
randomization arm, NPM1mut and  FLT3-ITD  status,
difference in OS from CR was no longer significant
(HR=1.86 [0.84 – 4.12]).
Among the 61 NPM1mut patients who achieved a
CR or CRp, a positive NPM1mut MRD after induction
was associated with an increased cause-specific hazard
of relapse: HR=3.66 [1.10 – 12.15] (p=0.035). Thus,
24-month CIR was 55% [39 – 69%] in the 46 patients with
positive MRD versus 21% [5 – 45%] in the 15 patients
with negative MRD (Figure 3B). After adjustment for
treatment arm and FLT3-ITD status, the effect of positive
NPM1mut MRD appeared to be similar (HR: 3.42 [0.98
– 11.96]) although no longer statistically significant.
Regarding OS from CR, NPM1mut MRD after induction
had no significant impact (HR=3.06 [0.71 – 13.24]).

[2.81 – 17.07], p<0.0001) in univariate analysis and in
multivariate analysis (HR=4.64 [1.38 – 15.62], p=0.013)
Similarly, we found that NPM1mut MRD at
the end of treatment was associated with an increased
cause-specific hazard of relapse: HR=3.16 [1.18 – 8.45],
p=0.022 and this association persisted after adjustment for
treatment arm (HR=2.74 [1.00 – 7.54, p=0.050]). CIR at
24 months was 67% in the 9 patients with positive MRD
and 45% in the 32 patients with negative MRD (Figure
4B). However, NPM1mut MRD response at the end of
treatment did not influenced OS from CR in the cohort
(HR=2.37 [0.69 – 8.19]).

Effect of GO treatment on MRD
GO treatment had no effect on WT1 MRD negativity,
either after induction therapy (75% of WT1 MRD negative
patient in the GO arm versus 65% in the control arm,
p=0.29) or at the end of treatment (82% versus 80%, p=1).
When the analysis was restricted to the subset of patients
with favourable or intermediate karyotype, results were
similar (Figure 5A).
A negative NPM1mut MRD was more frequently
observed in patients treated in the GO arm compared to
those treated in the control arm: 39% versus 7% (p=0.006)
achieved MRD negativity after induction therapy and 91%
versus 61% (p=0.028) at the end of treatment, respectively
in the GO arm and in the control arm (Figure 5B). When
adjusted for FLT3-ITD status, treatment with GO was still
independently associated with NPM1mut MRD negativity
both after induction and at the end of treatment.

Prognostic impact of MRD at the end of treatment
At the end of treatment, a positive WT1 MRD was
associated with an increased cause-specific hazard of
relapse (HR=3.41 [1.62 – 7.17], p=0.001). Thus, 24-month
CIR was 76% [31 - 94%] in the 15 patients with positive
MRD and 42% [28 - 54%] in the 63 patients with negative
MRD (Figure 4A). This difference remained significant in
multivariate analysis (HR=2.84 [1.05 – 7.67], p= 0.039).
A positive WT1 MRD after consolidation therapy was
also associated with a shorter OS from CR (HR=6.92

and patient outcome, using sensitive cDNA – based
RQ-PCR assays of two molecular MRD markers, WT1
overexpression and NPM1 mutations in a homogeneous
population of AML patients aged 50 to 70 years treated
in the multicentric randomized ALFA-0701 trial, which
tested the addition of GO to conventional chemotherapy.
With these two markers, 190 patients /278 (68%)
enrolled in this study were informative at diagnosis
for MRD monitoring. MRD data were available in 115
patients /149 (77%) informative patients in CR or CRp
after induction and in 86 patients /122 (70%) in continuous
response at the end of treatment. Seventy two patients
were positive for both markers.
Our results showed that WT1 MRD was associated
with an increase cause specific hazard of relapse and with
a shorter OS from CR. These results remained significant
in multivariate analysis. Regarding NPM1mut patients,
a positive MRD was associated with an increase cause
specific hazard of relapse. Correlation between NPM1mut
MRD and survival duration was not observed, probably
because of the smaller number of patients but we cannot
excluded others explanations, as selection of a resistant
clone [15] or impact of DNMT3A mutation, which is
frequently associated with NPM1 mutations[16].
The prognostic value of NPM1mut MRD on
patient’s outcome had been previously reported in
younger adults with AML [7-9]. We observed the same
results in a population of older patients. The value of
MRD monitoring based on WT1 transcript levels has
been debated because of the difficulty to discriminate the
residual expression of leukemic cells from the background
expression. However, several studies have shown a
correlation between a detectable WT1 MRD and clinical
outcomes [17-21]. The validity of WT1 transcript levels
was acknowledged in the ELN consortium guidelines
with a standardized method and the authors proposed
threshold for MRD detection in BM and PB samples [11].
In our study, concordance analysis between paired BM
and PB samples showed that WT1 MRD levels were more
frequently positive in PB than in the corresponding BM
samples and we chose to analyse only PB samples. Our
results eventually showed that WT1 MRD level measured
in PB samples was well correlated with relapse risk and
OS from CR, although WT1 is a less sensible marker than
NPM1mut.
In this study, we compared MRD levels in patients
treated in the control arm and in the GO arm. The
proportion of patients with a negative NPM1mut MRD
was significantly superior after induction and at the end
of treatment in the GO arm as compared to control arm.
Correlation between MRD negativity and GO treatment
was not observed with WT1 transcript levels probably
because of the lower sensitivity of this marker for which
the median MRD reduction between diagnosis and
remission samples was only 1 log. In the ALFA-0701
study as in the AML16 MRC study, GO treatment was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

associated with a benefit in survival endpoints although
there was no difference in CR rates [12, 22]. It has been
shown that assessment of treatment response is more
informative by MRD monitoring than by conventional
morphology [23, 24]. Our results in NPM1mut patients
argued in favour of a better quality of remission in patients
treated with GO, which can be related to the better
outcome observed with GO treatment.
Two recent studies have reported results of MRD
monitoring by MFC in patients treated with GO. In a nonrandomized pediatric study, 232 AML children received
chemotherapy or GO plus chemotherapy or GO alone
according to MRD levels assessed by MFC after first
induction. GO alone or in combination with chemotherapy
reduced MRD levels: 13/17 MRD positive patients treated
with GO alone and 13/29 MRD positive patients treated
with GO plus chemotherapy became MRD negative [25].
In the randomized MRC AML16 trial, MRD negativity,
assessed by MFC, after induction was correlated with OS
in the whole patient cohort. However, treatment with GO
was not associated with MRD negativity [5]. Thus, our
randomized study demonstrated for the first time a direct
impact of GO treatment on MRD assessed by NPM1mut
levels in adult AML patients, which could be related to
the higher cumulative dose of GO administered during
induction in ALFA-0701 study.
Overall, our results confirm the prognostic
significance of MRD based on WT1 overexpression and
NPM1 mutations in AML. Interestingly, we showed that
treatment with GO significantly improved molecular
response assessed by NPM1mut detection after induction
therapy and at the end of treatment. Finally, our results
suggest that MRD assessment after induction may be used
as a surrogate marker in AML, of interest in the context of
news drugs development.

METHODS
Patients and treatment
Two hundred and seventy eight patients aged 50 to
70 years old, with previously untreated de novo AML were
enrolled in the ALFA-0701 trial. Patients were randomly
assigned to receive standard induction chemotherapy with
daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 at day 1, 2 and 3 and cytarabine
200 mg/m2 in continuous infusion from D1 to D7 with or
without GO in fractioned 3 mg/m2 doses (maximum: 5 mg/
dose) at D1, D4 and D7. Then, patients in CR received two
consolidation courses with cytarabine and daunorubicin
with or without GO 3 mg/m2 (maximum: 5 mg) at D1,
according to their initial randomization arm.
Collection of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral
blood (PB) samples was recommended by the protocol
at AML diagnosis, after induction therapy, and after each

to ABL control gene and results were expressed as the ratio
WT1 copy number / ABL copy number x 100 (%). The
upper limit of normal was defined as 2.5% in BM samples
and 0.5% in PB samples, as recommended in the ELN
study [11]. We considered that WT1 was overexpressed
at AML diagnosis when WT1 mRNA level was ≥ 10-fold
the upper limit of normal (i.e., 25% in BM and 5% in PB
samples). The achievement of MRD levels below 2.5%
in BM or 0.5% in PB was hereafter defined as a negative
MRD.

consolidation courses. All patients gave informed consent
for both treatment and genetic analysis before inclusion,
according to the declaration of Helsinki. The study is
registered with EudraCT, number 2007-002933-36 and
with ClinicalTials.gov Identifier NCT00927498.

Cytogenetic analysis
Cytogenetic R-banding analysis was performed
on diagnostic BM samples using standard methods.
Karyotypes were described according to the International
System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature
recommendations[26] and classified within favorable,
intermediate and unfavorable groups[12] .

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as median (25th-75th percentile)
for quantitative variables and count (percentage) for
qualitative variables.
First, agreement of MRD measurement between
paired BM and PB samples was assessed using the Bland
and Altman plot [29]. Such plots compute 95% limits of
agreement for each comparison (average difference ±
1.96 standard deviation of the difference), which tell us
how far apart measurements by the two methods are more
likely to be for most individuals, allowing to investigate
the existence of any systematic difference between the
measurements (i.e., fixed bias) and to identify possible
outliers. Otherwise, we computed the percentage of
discordant results (i.e., MRD positive in one sample and
negative in the other) using traditional cut-offs, namely
2% in BM samples and 0.5% in PB samples for WT1
overexpression, and 0.1% in BM and PB samples for
NPM1mut.
The evaluation of the predictive value on the
occurrence of death or relapse, of the MRD levels after
induction or after consolidation according to previous
thresholds, was restricted to the subsample of patients
in complete remission. The effect of MRD levels on OS
was assessed through a proportional hazard Cox model.
When considering the effect of MRD levels on the
occurrence of relapse, and to account for the competing
events of death without relapse and hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation, we modeled the cause-specific hazard
of relapse using Cox models. Results were adjusted for
treatment arm, cytogenetic and FLT3-ITD status. At last,
cumulative incidences of relapse (CIR) were plotted.
Finally, the effect of GO on MRD negativity was
assessed by a Fisher’s exact test comparing negativity of
MRD after induction and at the end of treatment across
the treatment arms. This comparison was then adjusted for
FLT3-ITD status.
Statistical analyses were performed on R (http://
www.R-project.org/) software. All p-values were twosided, with p<0.05 denoting statistical significance.

Gene mutations analysis
NPM1mut screening was performed by PCR and
fragment analysis as previously described [27]. Samples
showing a mutated profile were then analyzed by direct
Sanger sequencing in order to identify the type of
mutation. NPM1 exon 12 was amplified by PCR from
genomic DNA using the HotStar Taq DNA Polymerase
Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Purified PCR products
were subsequently sequenced twice in reverse direction
using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) and analyzed
on the Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer.
Data were analyzed with the SeqScape software version
2.5. FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) were
screened as previously described [28].

Quantification of NPM1mut transcript levels
The assessment of NPM1mut transcript levels was
performed on an ABI Prism 7900 platform (Applied
Biosystems) with a mutation-specific RQ-PCR assay. For
NPM1 mutation type B, we applied the RQ-PCR assay
designed by Gorello et al [6] . For NPM1 mutations types
A and D, we used primers and probe and PCR conditions
described by Krönke et al [9] to minimize the wild-type
background. Plasmids from Ipsogen (Marseille, France)
were used to establish the standard curves. MRD levels
were reported as the normalized values of NPM1mut copy
number/ABL copy number x 100 (%). The quantitative
detection limit of the assays was 0.1%. The achievement
of MRD levels below this threshold was hereafter defined
as a negative MRD.

Quantification of WT1 expression levels
The quantification of WT1 transcripts was performed
on an ABI Prism 7900 platform using the standardized
ELN RQ-PCR assay. WT1 mRNA levels were normalized
