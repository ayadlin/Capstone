Abstract
Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles, secreted by normal
and neoplastic cells. The outcome following interaction
between the cellular immune system and cancer-derived
exosomes is not well understood. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a key
factor supporting expansion and differentiation of CTL and
natural killer (NK) cells but can also support regulatory
T cells and their suppressive functions. Our study examined
whether tumor-derived exosomes could modify lymphocyte
IL-2 responses. Proliferation of healthy donor peripheral
blood lymphocytes in response to IL-2 was inhibited by
tumor exosomes. In unfractionated lymphocytes, this effect
was seen in all cell subsets. Separating CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T
cells, and NK cells revealed that CD8+ T-cell proliferation
was not inhibited in the absence of CD4+ T cells and that NK
cell proliferation was only slightly impaired. Other exosome
effects included selective impairment of IL-2–mediated
CD25 up-regulation, affecting all but the CD3+CD8 T-cell
subset. IL-2–induced Foxp3 expression by CD4+CD25+ cells
was not inhibited by tumor exosomes, and the suppressive
function of CD4+CD25+ T cells was enhanced by exosomes. In
contrast, exosomes directly inhibited NK cell killing function
in a T-cell–independent manner. Analysis of tumor exosomes
revealed membrane-associated transforming growth factor
B1 (TGFB1), which contributed to the antiproliferative effects,
shown by using neutralizing TGFB1-specific antibody. The
data show an exosome-mediated mechanism of skewing IL-2
responsiveness in favor of regulatory T cells and away from
cytotoxic cells. This coordinated ‘‘double hit’’ to cellular
immunity strongly implicates the role of exosomes in tumor
immune evasion. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7458–66]

produced in advanced human malignancies, shown by the analysis
of malignant effusions (11, 12), and likely enter the circulating
exosome pool (13). However, patients with malignant tumor
effusions do not spontaneously mount a protective antitumor
immune response, suggesting that the immune system is either
insufficiently activated or nonresponsive to tumor exosomes
in vivo. Another possibility is that tumor exosomes actively impair
immune responses, and this is the subject of the current report.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is of central importance in the homeostasis
of lymphoid cells and in promoting the survival, proliferation, and
functional differentiation of several lymphocyte subsets, including
natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+CD25+ regulatory
T cells (Treg; refs. 14–16). Here, the responses of peripheral blood
lymphocytes (PBL), obtained from healthy donors, to IL-2 in the
absence or presence of tumor exosomes was compared. We show
impaired lymphocyte proliferation in response to IL-2 in the
presence of tumor exosomes. This inhibition requires the CD4+
T-cell subset. We highlight a novel mechanism in which IL-2–
mediated up-regulation of CD25 is selectively inhibited by tumor
exosomes in NK cells and CD8+ CTL but not CD8 T cells. The
cytotoxic function of NK cells was impaired following tumor
exosome treatment, but CD4+CD25+ Treg cells remained IL-2
responsive through induction of Foxp3 expression, and their
inhibitory function was enhanced by tumor exosomes. Our data
show that tumor exosomes express membrane-associated transforming growth factor h1 (TGFh1), which contributes to the
antiproliferative effects. Exosomes may therefore be physiologically
important for skewing immune responses away from cytotoxic
effector mechanisms toward Treg cell responses, contributing to
tumor immune escape.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
Exosomes are a population of nanometer-sized vesicles, actively
secreted by a diverse range of living cells, with physiologic
functions that include immune modulation (1). Several reports
document the immune-activating capacity of exosomes isolated
from dendritic cells (2–5) and other cell types (6, 7), yet cells such
as intestinal epithelia may produce tolerogenic exosomes (8).
The immunology of tumor exosomes is poorly understood, with
reported activatory (9) and inhibitory effects (10); differences are
probably dependent on the exosome phenotype. Exosomes are

Tumor cells and exosome purification. Data presented were obtained
with tumor cell line–derived exosomes (mesothelioma cell line established
within the department from pleural fluid; obtained from a patient with
advanced pleural malignant mesothelioma). Additional tumor cell lines
were used in some experiments, as stated, including prostate cancer
cells (DU145 and PC3), the myelogenous leukemia line K562, the T-cell
lymphoma Jurkat ( from EACC), and the natural killer cell line NKL (ref. 17;
a gift from Dr. E. Wang, Medical Biochemistry and Immunology, Cardiff
University, Cardiff, United Kingdom). EBV-immortalized B cells were
prepared as described (18). Cultures were confirmed free of Mycoplasma
by monthly screening by PCR (purchased from Minerva Biolabs). Cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted fetal
bovine serum and antibiotics. Medium from confluent cultures (5–7 days)
was depleted of cells and debris by centrifugation before ultracentrifugation
(LE80K, Beckman Coulter) on a 30% sucrose/D2O cushion (19). The cushion
was collected, diluted in excess PBS, and exosomes were pelleted by
ultracentrifugation. The protein content of each preparation was quantified
using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce).
Electron microscopy. A method similar to that previously reported (6)
was used to visualize exosome preparations. Briefly, frozen exosomes were

thawed on ice and resuspended in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). A
5-AL drop of the suspension was pipetted onto a pioloform-coated copper
grid and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. The grid was
transferred to a 50-AL drop of double distilled water for 2 min and this
process was repeated seven times for a total of eight water washes. The
sample was stained on ice for 10 min with a 5-AL drop of 2% methyl
cellulose containing 2% uranyl acetate. Excess fluid was removed with a
piece of Whatman filter paper and allowed to air dry for 10 min before
viewing by transmission electron microscopy (Philips EM 208, FEI).
Western blotting. Ten micrograms of whole-cell lysates were prepared
as previously described (20), or 10 Ag of purified exosomes were made to
40-AL final volume in sample buffer (6 mol/L urea, 2% SDS, 30% glycerol,
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, and freshly added 5% v/v h2-mercaptoethanol).
Samples were subjected to electrophoresis through 10% bis-acrylamide
gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Following
overnight blocking in 3% nonfat milk in 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T),
primary antibody (added at 0.2–2 Ag/mL) was added for 1 h, followed by
three washes in PBS-T. Molecular weight markers (Cruz Marker, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and primary antibodies were detected using
Cruz Marker–compatible goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G-horseradish
peroxidase (IgG-HRP) conjugated at 1:12,000 dilution in PBS-T for 30-min
incubation followed by five washes in PBS-T. Bands were visualized using
the ECL+ system (GE Healthcare). The antibodies used included TGS101,
lysosomal integral membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1), intercellular adhesion
molecule (ICAM)-1, h1-integrin, heat shock protein (hsp)-70, hsp90, Her-2/
neu, histone H1, and calnexin-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-CD81 and anti-CD9 mAbs (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were used on samples prepared with nonreducing
conditions. Anti–MIC-A and anti–MIC-B were from R&D Systems. Antimesothelin and anti-acetylcholinesterase mAbs were from Abcam Plc. Anti–
class I (clone HC10) was a gift from the Medical Research Council Cooperative, Cardiff University. Rat anti-grp94 (gp96; Stressgen) was detected
using antirat IgG-HRP conjugated antibody (Dako) at 1:15,000 dilution in
PBS-T. In this case, molecular weight markers (high-range rainbow
markers) were from Bio-Rad.
Isolation and analysis of lymphocytes. PBL from healthy donors,
purified by Histopaque (Sigma), were subjected to 2-h adhesion to plastic
to remove adherent monocytes. The nonadherent cells were used in subsequent experiments. Multicolor flow cytometry (FACSCanto, Becton
Dickinson) running FACSDiva software was done with antibodies from
Becton Dickinson: CD3-allophycocyanin (APC), CD8-phycoerythrin (PE)Cy7, CD4-APC-Cy7, CD56-PE-Cy5, and CD16-PE-Cy5 (used together) and
CD25-FITC. Foxp3 analysis was done using eBioscience kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions. NK cells were defined by the lack of CD3
expression and as CD56+CD16 , CD56+CD16+, or CD56 CD16+. Purification
of lymphocyte subsets was done using CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell negative
isolation kits (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
CD56+ NK cells were purified first by depleting CD3+ T cells, followed by
positive isolation of CD56+ cells (Miltenyi Biotec).
Lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxicity assay. Lymphocytes were
treated with recombinant human IL-2 (0–500 units/mL; Proleukin) or
phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma) to trigger proliferation. In some experiments, TGFh1 ( from Peprotech) was added as an inhibitor of proliferation/
cytotoxicity. Proliferating cells in 96-well plates were pulsed with 1 ACi/well
of [3H]thymidine for the final 18 h of cultures before harvesting and
measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation (Microbeta-3, Perkin-Elmer). For
NK cytotoxicity assays, NK cells were enriched (using anti-CD3 antibody–
coated Dynal beads), and the remaining population (confirmed as >79%
CD3 by flow cytometry) was used in standard 4-h 51Cr release assays with
K562 cells as targets.
Treg cell isolation and in vitro suppression assay. Healthy donor
PBL (50  106) were subjected to CD4+CD25+ isolation using a Treg
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Fractions before and after isolation were compared by flow cytometry,
staining with anti–CD4-APCCy7 (Becton Dickinson) and anti–CD25-PE
(Miltenyi Biotec), to assess purity. The CD4+CD25+ fraction was left
untreated for 24 h or treated with IL-2 (250 units/mL) and/or exosomes

(10 Ag/105 cells). The cells were washed in 10 volume (in culture medium)
to remove IL-2 and exosomes and added back (at 2  103, 10  103, or 50 
103 per well) to unfractionated PBL from the same donor (100  103 per
well). Proliferation was then initiated with 1 Ag/mL PHA (Sigma) and, after
3 days, [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured.
ELISA for IL-10 and TGFB1. ELISA development reagents (duo-set kit)
for human IL-10 and human TGFh1 were purchased from R&D Systems,
with subsequent assays done as recommended by the manufacturer.
Blocking, substrate, and stopping solutions were purchased from R&D
Systems. High-binding microtitre ELISA strips were from Greiner. In TGFh1
colocalization experiments, antihuman CD81 mAb (carrier protein free;
Becton Dickinson) was substituted for the TGFh1 capture antibody, with the
remainder of the assay done exactly as for the TGFh1 ELISA. Absorbance
was measured with wavelength correction (A 450–A 540 nm) on a 3550
Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad).
TGFB1 neutralization. Lymphocytes were treated with IL-2 (250 units/mL)
to trigger proliferation in the presence or absence of recombinant human
TGFh1 (5 ng/mL) or tumor exosomes (10 Ag/105 cells). In some wells,
increasing concentrations (up to 10 Ag/mL) of a well-characterized TGFh1
neutralizing antibody (clone 141322, R&D Systems; refs. 21, 22) were added.
After 3 days, the degree of proliferation was assessed by measuring
[3H]thymidine incorporation.
Statistical analysis. All data are represented as mean F SE. Comparisons
between exosome-treated and nontreated groups were done using paired
t tests, calculated using graphing and statistical software Prism 4 (version
4.03) from GraphPad.

Results
Tumor exosome characterization. Purification of exosomes
derived from cultured cancer cells (of various types) revealed
small (30–100 nm in diameter) vesicular structures, typical of
exosomes in general (2, 6, 23), by electron microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Preparations were free of contaminating
membranous fragments or electron dense apoptotic bodies (as
previously described; ref. 24). The molecular phenotype of the
exosomes was also typical of exosomes from other sources.
Comparing whole-cell lysates with exosome preparations revealed
an absence of endoplasmic reticulum–resident proteins (calnexin
and grp94) or nuclear proteins (histone H1) from the exosomes.
Yet, exosomes were relatively enriched in the multivesicular body
marker TSG101 and the GPI-anchored protein acetyl-cholinesterase (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Exosomes also stained positively for
CD9, CD81, LAMP-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
hsp70, hsp90, h1-integrin, and ICAM-1. Tumor-associated antigens,
such as Her-2/neu and mesothelin, and MHC molecules including
members of the MICA-family were also exosomally expressed
(Supplementary Fig. S1C).
The effect of tumor exosomes on IL-2–mediated lymphocyte
proliferation. We first investigated the effect of IL-2 on lymphocyte proliferation in the presence or absence of tumor exosomes.
In the presence of exosomes, IL-2–mediated proliferation was
severely impaired, measured by a marked inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation, after only 48 h following IL-2 treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). CFSE labeling and multicolor flow
cytometry revealed that the antiproliferative effect of tumor
exosomes affected CD3+CD8+, CD3+CD8 , and CD3 lymphocytes
(not shown). Flow cytometry also revealed an exosome-driven
impairment in morphologic changes (assessed by increased forward
scatter/side scatter) associated with IL-2–driven lymphocyte blast
formation (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). We conclude that tumor
exosomes strongly impair proliferative responses to IL-2 in all
lymphocyte populations.

The antiproliferative exosome effects are mediated principally by the CD4+ T-cell subset. We next studied whether the
antiproliferative effect of exosomes was retained on fractionating
peripheral blood lymphocytes into various subpopulations. Using
immunomagnetic beads, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD56+ NK
cells were purified and stimulated with IL-2 in the presence or
absence of tumor exosomes. The proliferative response was
assessed after 3 days (Fig. 1). Tumor exosomes strongly inhibited
IL-2–mediated lymphocyte proliferation in unfractionated cells
(>67% inhibition at 250 units/mL IL-2 in the experiment shown;
Fig. 1A). The antiproliferative effect remained evident in the
purified CD4+ T-cell population (50% inhibition; Fig. 1B). Whereas
purified CD8+ T cells responded strongly to IL-2, there was
no exosome-mediated inhibition of this proliferative response
(Fig. 1C), and the proliferation of CD56+ NK cells was only weakly
inhibited by tumor exosomes (24% inhibition; Fig. 1D). The CD56+
NK cell fraction, however, contained f10% non-CD56+ cells, which

may account for the partial antiproliferative exosome effect. We
therefore repeated the experiments using the NK cell line NKL
(Fig. 1E). Although tumor exosomes exerted an antiproliferative
effect on NKL cells, this was weak and was undetectable at IL-2
doses of z200 units/mL. In contrast, a CD4+ T-cell line, Jurkat,
showed high sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of tumor
exosomes (Fig. 1F). In none of the studies was there evidence of
apoptotic death mediated by exosomes or by IL-2 (assessed by
Annexin V binding; data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that
it is principally through the CD4+ T-cell population that the
antiproliferative effect of exosomes is mediated, as CD56+ cells are
only weekly inhibited, and the IL-2–driven proliferation of CD8+ T
cells is not impaired by direct interactions with tumor exosomes.
The effect of exosomes on CD25 expression. We hypothesized
that inhibition of IL-2–driven proliferation may be due to
exosome-mediated impairment of the IL-2 receptor. We examined
possible changes in the expression of the IL-2Ra chain (CD25),

(B), CD8+ T-cell (C ), or CD3 CD56+ NK cell subsets. Cells (105 per well) were treated with IL-2 [0, 50, or 250 units/mL (A–C ) or, due to limiting cell numbers, 0 and
250 units/mL (D )] in the presence or absence of tumor exosomes. Proliferation was assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation at day 3. Columns, mean

Tumor Exosomes Inhibit Lymphocyte Responses to IL-2

Figure 2. Tumor exosomes selectively impair up-regulation of CD25. Lymphocytes were examined for the expression of CD25 6 d after treatment with IL-2 in the
presence or absence of tumor exosomes. A, dot plot representation of CD25 expression of CD3+ gated cells. B to D, quantification of changes in the proportion of
CD25-positive CD8+ (B), CD8 (C), and NK cells (D ), and CD25 expression levels [mean fluorescence intensity (MFI )]. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. *, P < 0.05;

which is required for the formation of the high-affinity receptor
complex. In unfractionated PBL, IL-2 stimulated a dose-dependent
elevation in the proportion of CD25-positive CD8+ T cells, CD8
T cells, and NK cells. In the presence of tumor exosomes, however,
this induction was significantly inhibited, but in a cell type–
specific manner as it was not seen in CD3+CD8 T cells (Fig. 2).
This observation shows that the expression of the high-affinity IL-2
receptor is selectively impaired on cytotoxic effector cells,
remaining readily inducible on the Treg cell–containing population, suggesting that Treg cells may selectively remain functional in
the presence of tumor exosomes.
Tumor exosomes do not impair the function of Treg cells.
To address whether IL-2–dependent responses, other than
proliferation, were retained by the CD3+CD8 population, we
examined the effect of IL-2 on the expression of the forkhead
transcription factor Foxp3 (14), exclusively expressed by Treg cells
(25). Following 18-h stimulation with IL-2, there was a 4-fold
increase in the proportion of Foxp3-positive CD3+CD4+ cells.
Importantly, however, there was no exosome-mediated impairment
of Foxp3 induction (Fig. 3A and C), indicating that this cell
population remained sensitive to proliferation-independent IL-2
effects. Yet, in the same samples, IL-2–mediated elevation of CD25
expression was inhibited by exosomes, but again only in the CD4
population (Fig. 3B and D). Interestingly, addition of exosomes

www.aacrjournals.org

alone (in the absence of IL-2) was sufficient to significantly
increase the proportion of Foxp3+ (but not CD25+) CD4+ cells,
showing tumor exosomes as a stimulus in their own right for
inducing a Treg cell phenotype. We next tested whether the ability
of Treg cells to suppress immune responses was affected by
exposure to tumor exosomes. CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were purified
from fresh PBL (Fig. 4A) and were left untreated for 24 h or
activated with IL-2 and/or tumor exosomes to elevate Foxp3
expression. The cells were subsequently washed, to remove IL-2
and exosomes, before adding at increasing numbers (2,000–50,000
per well) to 105 unfractionated lymphocytes. Proliferation was
initiated by addition of PHA (1 Ag/mL) and, 3 days later, measured
by [3H]thymidine incorporation. In the absence of PHA, there
was minimal background cell division (107 F 38 cpm) on day 3,
whereas PHA stimulated a strong proliferative response (10,461 F
403 cpm). Purified Treg cells did not proliferate in response
to PHA treatment (37 F 5 cpm). Adding increasing numbers of
Treg cells to PHA-stimulated autologous PBL showed their
capacity to inhibit proliferation. Of the conditions used to
preactivate Treg cells, it was clear that a combination of IL-2
with tumor exosomes significantly enhanced their inhibitory
capacity (67 F 4% inhibition of proliferation) at 1:10 Treg/PBL
ratio (Fig. 4B). Treatment of Treg cells with IL-2 alone (40 F 3%)
or with exosomes alone (41 F 14%) both stimulated inhibitory

Figure 3. IL-2–mediated induction of Foxp3 is not impaired by tumor exosomes. Analysis of Foxp3 (A and C ) or CD25 (B and D ) expression after 18-h stimulation with
IL-2 (250 units/mL) in the presence or absence of tumor exosomes (10 Ag/105 PBL). The IL-2–driven induction of Foxp3 expression is not inhibited by tumor exosomes.
Similarly, CD25 expression is unhindered by exosomes in the CD4+ cells, but significant CD25 impairment is evident in the CD4 cells. Columns, mean (n = 3);

functions above that of untreated Treg cells (25 F 5%). Tumor
exosomes, therefore, when combined with IL-2, strongly enhanced
the inhibitory functions of Treg cells, and tumor exosomes were a
stimulus in their own right, boosting the suppressive function of
Treg cells.
Tumor exosomes impair cytotoxic cell functions. The
consequence of exposure to tumor exosomes on NK cell cytolytic
function was next examined. In the absence of exosomes, activation
of purified (T-cell depleted) NK cells with 200 units/mL IL-2 for 3
days led to efficient cytotoxic killing of K562 cells. Adding exosomes
with IL-2, however, resulted in a significant and dose-dependent
reduction in killing (Fig. 5A), comparable to that achieved by highdose (50 ng/mL) TGFh1. This inhibition could not simply be
explained by differences in NK cell numbers after 3-day proliferation with IL-2 because cell numbers were equalized through
matched effector/target cell ratios for each group. Furthermore, the
depletion of T cells suggests a direct exosome-mediated inhibition
of NK cell killing capacity, which is unlikely to involve Treg cell–
suppressive effects. These experiments have also been successfully
reproduced using the NK cell line NKL (Fig. 5B), further confirming
a Treg cell–independent mechanism for impaired NK killing.

Tumor exosomes express TGFB1. To better understand the
molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of tumor
exosomes, we questioned whether immunosuppressive cytokines
were present in our exosome preparations. We focused on the
possible expression of IL-10 and TGFh1 by tumor exosomes
because these factors are strongly implicated in immune evasion
mechanisms and may be responsible for the antiproliferative
(or anticytotoxic) effects observed in our study. IL-10 and TGFh1
ELISAs were done in parallel on the same samples of exosomes
derived from tumor cells. Whereas IL-10 was consistently absent,
TGFh1 was measurable in mesothelioma exosomes (Supplementary
Fig. S3A) and in exosomes isolated from other cancer cell types
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). The average TGFh1 content for mesothelioma-derived exosomes was 7.12 F 1.14 pg TGFh1/Ag exosomes
(mean F SE of five preparations). To ascertain whether TGFh1 was
present as a soluble contaminant or associated with the exosome
membrane, we took two approaches: First, freshly prepared
exosomes were split into three aliquots. One aliquot (labeled
original) was used to assess starting TGFh1 quantity. An equal
aliquot was resuspended in >300 volume of PBS and pelleted at
100,000  g to wash away any soluble TGFh1. The final aliquot was

recombinant human TGFh1 before washing. Supplementary
Fig. S3C reveals that washing exosomes in vast excess volume of
PBS had little effect on TGFh1 levels. Similarly, exogenously added

soluble TGFh1 did not increase exosomal TGFh1 levels, suggesting
that TGFh1 was unlikely present as a soluble contaminant in the
exosome preparations. In addition, from the TGF spiking experiment,
it seems that either TGFh1 is unable to passively adsorb onto the

exosome membrane under these conditions or available binding sites
on the exosome surface were already occupied with TGFh1. We also
did a variation of the ELISA technique, where microtitre plates were
coated with either TGFh1 capture antibody or anti-CD81 mAb (to
bind exosomes to the plate based on their expression of CD81).
Following sample addition and subsequent washing steps, TGFh1
content was assessed exactly as done for the TGFh1 ELISA
(Supplementary Fig. S3D). Results revealed that the CD81 antibody–coated wells were unable to bind soluble TGFh1, yet a signal
was measured in wells containing exosomes, showing colocalization
of CD81 with TGFh1. We conclude that mesothelioma and other
tumor cell exosomes express membrane-associated TGFh1.
Exosomal TGFB1 contributes to antiproliferative effects and
is more potent than soluble TGFB1. We investigated whether
exosomally expressed TGFh1 was functional in mediating the
antiproliferative effects of tumor exosomes. Lymphocytes were
treated with IL-2 (250 units/mL) in the presence of soluble TGFh1
(5 ng/mL) or tumor exosomes (10 Ag/105 PBL). Both conditions
resulted in a significant impairment of IL-2–stimulated proliferation. Addition of TGFh neutralizing antibody (but not irrelevant
antibody, not shown) inhibited the antiproliferative effect of soluble TGFh1 and exosomes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A),
showing that TGFh1 expressed by exosomes was indeed involved
in the antiproliferative effect. When comparing the relative potency
of soluble TGFh1 with exosomally delivered TGFh1 (where 1 Ag
exosomes = 7 pg TGFh1 measured by ELISA), it was evident that
exosomal TGFh1 achieved a potent inhibitory effect at significantly
lower doses than soluble TGFh1 (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
The priming of cytotoxic NK and CD8+ T cells in readiness for
killing function is driven by IL-2 but, paradoxically, Treg cells and
their immune suppressive functions are also supported by IL-2 (15).
Evidence from the clinic has shown that, in certain cancers,
administering IL-2 as therapy can boost Treg cells and contribute
to tumor immune escape (16). Our study investigated whether
exosomes produced by cancer cells were involved in modulating
T-cell and NK cell responses to IL-2. Tumor exosomes had the
capacity to strongly inhibit IL-2–driven lymphocyte proliferation,

preventing blast formation, in all subpopulations. On isolation of
lymphocyte subsets, however, it became clear that although NK cell
proliferation was weekly impaired following direct interactions
with exosomes, the principal antiproliferative effect is mediated
through the CD4+ T-cell subset, as CD8+ T cells were impervious to
the antiproliferative effects of tumor exosomes in the absence of
CD4+ T cells.
When we investigated more subtle aspects of this phenomenon,
we discovered a unique selectivity in this exosome effect. IL-2
induces the expression of the high-affinity IL-2Ra chain (CD25),
and this occurs in CD3+CD8+ T cells, CD3+CD8 T cells, and CD3
CD56+/16+ NK cell subpopulations. However, in the presence of
tumor exosomes, this CD25 induction is markedly inhibited in all
but the CD3+CD8 T cells. Further phenotypic analysis revealed
that in the presence of tumor exosomes, the Treg cell–containing
population remained capable of responding to IL-2, exemplified by
induced Foxp3 expression. The Treg cell–mediated inhibition of
proliferation was enhanced by tumor exosomes and further
boosted when added in conjunction with IL-2. In contrast, freshly
isolated NK cells activated with IL-2 exhibited strong cytotoxicity
against K562 targets, but this function was significantly impaired
following tumor exosome treatment through a mechanism independent of Treg cells. Our data therefore identify a novel mechanism by which tumors may drive immune responses away from
cytotoxic effector mechanisms while not impairing, but supporting,
Treg cell activities.
The exosomes in our study were from cultured mesothelioma
cell lines, isolated from tissue samples or pleural fluid taken from
patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma. These
exosomes may therefore represent an extreme tumor exosome type,
being derived from a highly aggressive cancer type, with patient’s
survival after diagnosis typically f9 to 12 months (26). Yet the
exosome morphology was similar to those from other (tumor and
nontumor) sources, and they expressed numerous markers typical
of exosomes in general (27) as well as tumor-associated proteins
such as Her-2/neu (11, 23), mesothelin (28), and MICA/B (29). In
this sense, therefore, these are unremarkable tumor exosomes, and
it may be that our observation is equally applicable across multiple
tumor cell types. We have indeed observed the inhibition of
lymphocyte proliferation (stimulated by various nonphysiologic

Tumor Exosomes Inhibit Lymphocyte Responses to IL-2

mitogens such as PHA and CD3/CD28 antibody–coated beads)
using exosomes isolated from mesothelioma and other tumor
types: breast carcinoma (T47D), prostate cancer (DU145 and PC3),
and an EBV-immortalized B cells.3 Whether such diverse exosome
types can selectively impair IL-2 responses, as we have shown here,
remains to be determined, and this is the subject of ongoing
investigations in our laboratory. Other researchers have also
previously described the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation by
exosomes. For example, EBV-encoded latent membrane protein-1 is
expressed by exosomes secreted by EBV-immortalized B lymphocytes. These exosomes were able to impair proliferative responses
to PHA and CD3/CD28 beads in a manner that may have been
latent membrane protein-1 dependent (30). This molecule is not
expressed by non-EBV malignancies and is therefore not sufficient
to explain what seems to be an antiproliferative tumor exosome
effect in general.
Suppressive factors such as IL-10 or TGFh are produced by many
tumor types and may mediate antiproliferative and anticytotoxic
effects similar to those we observed for tumor exosomes. When we
examined the possible presence of these cytokines in our exosome
preparations, we found that IL-10 was not present at detectable
levels but TGFh1 was consistently found in tumor exosomes ( from
multiple tumor types). Further studies showed that exosomes
express a membrane-associated form of TGFh1 that could not be
removed by ultracentrifugation washing steps. This raised the
possibility that tumor exosomes were mediating at least some of
their effects through delivery of TGFh1 to lymphocytes. Administering a well-characterized TGFh1 neutralizing antibody to IL-2–
and exosome-treated lymphocytes partially restored proliferative
capacity, revealing that exosomal TGFh1 was indeed functional
and thus contributes to the inhibitory effect.
The amount of TGFh1 present in mesothelioma-derived exosomes was very low, at 7 pg/Ag of exosomes. In our experiments,
therefore, the effective dose of exosomal TGFh1 with which
lymphocytes were treated was 350 pg/mL. When we compared
the effects of soluble TGFh1 on lymphocyte proliferation, it was
clear that this dose was not sufficient to suppress IL-2–mediated
proliferative responses. In fact, 0.35 pg/mL exosomal TGFh1
administered to lymphocytes stimulated with 50 units/mL IL-2
mediated an antiproliferative effect comparable to 5,000 pg/mL
soluble TGFh1. This suggested that TGFh1 presented in the form
of exosomes was f1,400 times more potent than the soluble
form under these conditions. Differences in the cellular response
to soluble TGFh1 were also evident, such as a general impairment
of CD25 (IL-2Ra) expression (not shown) rather than the cell type–
selective effect obtained with exosomes. Enhanced potency of
membrane versus soluble TGFh1 in other systems has previously
been described (31). It may arise from sustained signaling by
membrane TGFh resulting in distinctive intracellular signaling
events (such as Notch1 activation), which do not occur with soluble
TGFh. It is possible that exosomal TGFh1 achieves similar
sustained signaling effects that explain their relative functional
potency. The role of other exosomal molecules in assisting the
delivery of TGFh1 to lymphocytes and in directing the cell type
selectivity, which we report here, clearly warrants further
investigations. Furthermore, the nature of TGFh1 anchorage to
the exosome membrane remains unknown, and the possible

involvement of latent associated peptide (32, 33) or h-glycan
(34, 35), as in other systems, requires clarification.
Previous reports have also shown that exosome-NK cell (9) and T-cell (36, 37) interactions are possible, with outcomes dependent
on the exosome phenotype. Although antigen presenting cell–
derived exosomes may directly activate T-cell responses (36), direct
interactions between T cells and tumor exosomes seem to be inhibitory. For example, Andreola et al. (37) have suggested that Fas
ligand–positive exosomes may directly deliver death signals to
activated (Fas-positive) T cells. They suggest this as a possible
mechanism by which tumors delete tumor-specific T cells in vivo,
and similar studies have also been published more recently (38).
Other reports suggest that tumor exosomes are responsible for
defective signaling responses in T cells by down-modulating CD3-~
and Janus-activated kinase 3, resulting in apoptosis (39), although
many of these studies relied on immortalized T-cell lines (Jurkat
cells), rather than freshly isolated T cells, and very high doses of
exosomes (400 Ag/mL). In none of the experiments presented in
this report, or in allied investigations within our laboratory, was
there evidence of exosome-mediated loss in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells,
indicating that Fas ligand–driven T-cell death is not a universal
consequence of tumor exosome interaction with T cells.
A recent report by Gastapar et al. (9) highlighted a role for hsp70
expression by tumor exosome in their interactions with NK cells.
Their experimental system involved colorectal cancer cell lines,
producing either hsp70 surface positive exosomes or a subline
(otherwise identical) producing hsp70 surface negative exosomes.
The former exosomes were potent at activating the migratory
and cytolytic functions of NK cells, whereas the hsp70 negative
exosomes remained nonactivating. Thus, even with such a closely
controlled experimental system, differences in the phenotype of
the exosomes were absolutely key to their immunologic effects.
Although the mesothelioma-derived exosomes used in our study
were hsp70 positive (by Western blot), it does not necessarily follow
that hsp70 was present at the exosome surface, as we showed
for other exosome types, even after robust cell stress (20). The fact
that mesothelioma-derived exosomes conspicuously impaired the
killing function of fresh NK cells and an NK cell line suggests that
either the exosomes are hsp70 surface negative or this potential
activatory mechanism is overwhelmed by inhibitory processes
occurring in parallel.
Several studies have shown activation of immune responses by
tumor exosomes, as prophylactic agents (40) or as therapeutic
vaccines in murine cancer models (23) and in humans (11, 41),
usually by loading them onto enriched dendritic cell populations.
By binding and endocytosing exosomes, dendritic cells may crosspresent exosome-delivered antigens to T cells and stimulate
antitumor immunity (11, 23). Much of the literature relating to
tumor exosome vaccines, therefore, are in reality dendritic cell–
based vaccines with exosomes acting as an antigen source. Liu
et al. (10) recently showed that pretreating mice with tumor
exosomes before vaccination with tumor exosome–pulsed dendritic cells was counterproductive, resulting in accelerated growth
of explanted tumors through a mechanism involving exosomemediated impairment of NK cell functions (10). Their report
showed that murine tumor exosomes were capable of inhibiting
IL-2–induced proliferation of NK cells and of inhibiting NK cell
cytolytic function (10). Our study supports such findings and
confirms that these effects are also observed with human tumor
exosomes in the absence of dendritic cells as carriers for
exosomes.

To date, however, Treg cells as potential exosome-reactive cells
have not been described, and the capacity of tumor exosomes
to inhibit cytotoxic effector cells while in parallel supporting Treg
cell phenotype and function was hitherto unknown. These exosome
effects, which are at least in part due to membrane TGFh1
expression, provide a coordinated ‘‘double hit’’ to cellular immunity. Tumor exosomes are likely to represent an important mechanism contributing to immune evasion in cancer.
