BACKGROUND: Dermatologic adverse events (AEs) can be key determinants of overall drug tolerability and of the maximum tolerated and recommended phase 2 doses in phase 1 trials. The authors present the largest dedicated analysis of dermatologic AEs on
phase 1 trials to date. METHODS: Data from a prospectively maintained database of patients with solid tumors who were enrolled
onto Cancer Therapeutics Evaluation Program (CTEP)-sponsored phase 1 trials of cytotoxic or molecularly targeted agents (MTAs)
from 2000 to 2010 were analyzed. Cumulative incidence, site, and type of drug-related dermatologic AEs were described and compared. The timing of worst drug-related dermatologic AEs was summarized. RESULTS: In total, 3517 patients with solid tumors and
6165 unique, drug-related dermatologic AEs were analyzed, including 1545 patients on MTA-only trials, 671 on cytotoxic-only trials,
and 1392 on combination MTA and cytotoxic trials. Of 1270 patients who had drug-related dermatologic events, the timing of the
worst AE was as follows: 743 (cycle 1), 303 (cycle 2), and 224 (cycle 3 or later). Although the cumulative incidence of grade 3 drugrelated AEs increased to 2.4% by cycle 6, it was only 1.6% at the end of cycle 1. The cumulative incidence of drug-related AEs was
highest in patients who received MTA-only therapy (P <.001) and differed by dose level (P <.001). In patients who received MTA-only
therapy, drug-related AEs were most common for combination kinase inhibitor-containing therapy (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of drug-related dermatologic AEs occur after the traditional dose-limiting toxicity monitoring period of phase 1

INTRODUCTION
Phase 1 clinical trials are designed with the objective of defining the optimal dose of an agent or combination of agents
that can be carried forward into further testing (recommended phase 2 dose).1 This determination is based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) that is deemed acceptable from a safety perspective.2 Thus, the definition of a
DLT is crucial to this determination and can be characterized in terms of both severity and duration. In addition, DLTs
are traditionally captured within the DLT period, a prespecified window of time from the initiation of study therapy that
often corresponds to the first cycle of treatment.3,4
The introduction of molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) into the landscape of phase 1 trials presents a continuing
challenge to defining and capturing adverse events on these studies. Compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, MTAs are
characterized by a distinct adverse event profile, with many agents displaying a higher incidence of nonhematologic toxicities.5-7 Of these nonhematologic toxicities, dermatologic adverse events are frequent yet underreported.8-10 In addition,
these adverse events can have a significant impact on quality of life and consistent dosing.11 Evaluations of patients on
MTA therapy have repeatedly indicated a significant association between low-grade events and a decline in quality of life
across multiple subdomains.10 Furthermore, chronic oral administration of MTAs may result in late and cumulative
adverse events that are not captured within the DLT monitoring period.12

CTEP Phase 1 Trials Late Skin Toxicity/Drilon et al

We characterized dermatologic adverse events of
MTAs, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and combinations of both
on phase 1 clinical trials sponsored by the Cancer Therapeutics Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (Bethesda, Md). Our objective was to
provide a systematic review of these adverse events using
this large prospective database to optimize dermatologic
DLT definitions for future phase 1 clinical trials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Selection

We used a prospectively maintained database of patients
enrolled onto CTEP-sponsored phase 1 clinical trials that
were activated between 2000 and 2010.13 Data from this
multicenter cohort were extracted from the Clinical Trials
Monitoring System database managed by Theradex Systems (Princeton, NJ). Only trials of molecularly targeted
or cytotoxic agents, administered either alone or in combination, were eligible for inclusion. Trials that included
immunomodulatory agents, radiation, or locoregional
therapy were excluded.
Cytotoxic agents were defined as drugs with a well
described mechanism of action associated with conventional chemotherapy directed against all actively dividing
cells. These included alkylating agents, antimetabolites,
antimicrotubule agents, and topoisomerase inhibitors.
Molecularly targeted agents were defined as drugs that target growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transduction pathways, transcription factors, or proteins
involved in epigenetic regulation within cancer cells.
These drugs were further subcategorized into kinase
inhibitors and nonkinase inhibitors.
Dose levels were classified relative to the highest
dose administered in each trial and were grouped into the
following levels: high (highest administered, dose level 1),
intermediate (highest administered, dose level 2; highest
administered, dose level 3), and low (highest administered, dose level 4 or lower). The length of treatment
cycles was as defined by individual protocols. For trials
with only 2 dose levels, both were grouped as high on the
assumption that these doses were close to or represented
the maximum tolerated dose.
The patients who were evaluated in this review met
the following criteria: age  18 years, solid tumor histology, adequate organ function (absolute neutrophil
count  1 3 109/L, hemoglobin  8 g/dL, platelet count
 75 3 109/L, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase 5
times the upper limit of normal, and total bilirubin 2
times the upper limit of normal), and receipt of at least 1

dose of study drug. These criteria differ from the protocolspecific eligibility criteria. Patients with leukemia or lymphoma were excluded.
Dermatologic Adverse Event Evaluation

Adverse event data included free text descriptions of the
adverse events and grades based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version
4.0.14 For clinical trials that used older versions of CTCAE,
toxicities were routinely mapped and converted to CTCAE
version 4.0 in accordance with a defined algorithm used by
CTEP and Theradex for publication of all NCI clinical trial
data. On the basis of the description, each adverse event
was classified as dermatologic or nondermatologic, and dermatologic events were further categorized using the
CTCAE. Categories included acneiform rash, maculopapular rash/erythematous rash/rash not otherwise specified,
urticaria, pruritus, dry skin, skin hyperpigmentation,
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (or hand-foot
syndrome), alopecia, oral mucositis, nail infection, nail discoloration, paronychia, and other (included other CTCAE
dermatologic categories or toxicities not otherwise specified). Oral mucositis and nail infection (categorized under
gastrointestinal disorders and infections and infestations,
respectively, using CTCAE version 4.0) were included in
this study in an effort to capture all mucocutaneous adverse
effects that are important from a dermatologic perspective.
Each adverse event was further classified by location (site)
as follows: generalized, face, scalp, chest, back, extremities,
hands and feet, fingers and toes, oral mucosa, other mucosa, injection site, and site not specified.
The percentage of patients who experienced each category of dermatologic adverse events and the percentage of
patients who experienced dermatologic adverse events at
each body site (both at any time during follow-up) were
reported for molecular and cytotoxic trials. Dermatologic
adverse event rates for patients who received treatment with
molecular versus cytotoxic agents were compared for each
category and each site separately using Fisher exact tests;
patients who received treatment with both types of agents
were excluded from these comparisons.
The cumulative incidence of drug-related dermatologic adverse events was estimated using competing risks
methodology with study discontinuation as a competing
event. The time to dermatologic adverse event was defined
as the number of cycles from the first dose of study drug
to a dermatologic adverse event. For patients who discontinued treatment without a dermatologic adverse event,
the time to study discontinuation was defined as the number of cycles from the first dose of study drug to study

discontinuation. The cumulative incidence of drugrelated dermatologic toxicity was compared between
groups (MTA vs cytotoxic vs both, high dose vs intermediate dose vs low dose, and number and type of MTAs
administered) using the Gray test.15
For each patient, the cycle in which they experienced
the worst (highest) grade of a drug-related dermatologic
adverse event while on study was identified. If the worst
grade was experienced more than once, then the earliest
cycle was used. The percentage of patients experiencing
their worst dermatologic adverse event in cycle 1, cycle 2,
and cycle 3 or later was reported as well as the percentage
of patients who did not experience drug-related dermatologic adverse events while on study. All statistical analyses
were done using the software packages SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and R 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Patient Population

In total, 3517 patients with a broad range of solid tumors
were treated on 127 phase 1 clinical trials of molecularly
targeted or cytotoxic agents administered either alone or
in combination. The baseline characteristics of these
patients are summarized in Table 1. Of these 3517
patients, 1454 (41%) received treatment with MTAs, either as a single MTA (611 of 3517 patients; 17%) or as a
combination of MTAs (843 of 3517 patients; 24%). Of
these, 780 of 1454 patients (54%) received therapy containing 1 or more kinase inhibitors, and 674 of 1454
(46%) received nonkinase inhibitor-containing therapy.
Six hundred seventy-one of 3517 patients (19%) received
treatment with cytotoxic agents either as a single cytotoxic
agent (556 of 3517 patients; 16%) or as a combination of
cytotoxic agents (115 of 3517 patients; 3%).
Of all 3517 patients, 1392 (40%) received therapy
with a combination of molecularly targeted and cytotoxic
agents. Of these, 624 of 1392 patients (45%) received kinase inhibitor-containing therapy, and 768 of 1392
(55%) received nonkinase inhibitor-containing therapy.
A detailed summary of agent classification is included in
Supporting Table 1 (see online supporting information).
Patients who received therapy with any of the above
agents were treated at the following dose levels: high
(1727 of 3517 patients; 49%), intermediate (997 of 3517
patients; 28%), and low (793 of 3517 patients; 23%).
The median cycle length was 4 weeks (range, 1-10 weeks),
and the median length of time on study was 3 cycles
(range, 1-85 cycles) or 8 weeks (range, 0-187 weeks).

Type and Location of Drug-Related
Dermatologic Adverse Events

Six thousand one hundred sixty-five unique drug-related
dermatologic adverse events were analyzed. Grade 1, 2, 3,
and 4 drug-related adverse events were observed in
75.5%, 22.6%, 1.9%, and <0.1% of the unique adverse
events, respectively. The percentage of patients experiencing drug-related dermatologic adverse events of any grade
that occurred in any cycle was significantly increased in
patients who received MTAs versus those who received cytotoxic agents with respect to maculopapular rash (20.8%
vs 3.7%), oral mucositis (17% vs 11.6%), palmar-plantar
erythrodysesthesia syndrome (9.5% vs 1.2%), pruritus
(6.5% vs 1.2%), dry skin (5.3% vs 1.6%), acneiform rash
(3.9% vs 0.4%), and urticaria (0.8% vs 0%). Comparisons for these adverse events had P values < .001 with 2
exceptions: P 5 .0128 for urticaria, and P 5 .0015 for

mucositis. Patients who received cytotoxic agents were
more likely to have alopecia compared with those who
received MTAs (17.6% vs 5.3%;, P < .001). Nail changes
(including nail discoloration, nail infection, and paronychia) and skin discoloration were not significantly different between groups (Fig. 1A, Supporting Table 2; see
online supporting information). Select dermatologic
adverse events are depicted in Figure 2.
The distribution of adverse events by location (site)
is summarized in Figure 1B and Supporting Table 2 (see
online supporting information). The percentage of
patients experiencing drug-related dermatologic events of
any grade and occurring at any cycle at a specific body site
was significantly increased (P < .05) in patients who
received only MTAs compared with those who received
only cytotoxic agents: oral cavity (17% vs 12%), hands
and feet (10% vs 1%), face (7% vs 1%), extremities (3%
vs 1%), chest (2% vs < 1%), back (2% vs < 1%), and not
otherwise specified (21% vs 5%). Only dermatologic
adverse events that involved the scalp were significantly
increased (P < .05) in patients who received only cytotoxic agents compared with those who received only
MTAs (18% vs 7%), largely secondary to alopecia in the
former.
Timing of Drug-Related Dermatologic
Adverse Events

In total, 527 of 3517 patients (15%) experienced their
worst (highest grade) dermatologic adverse event on trial
in cycle 2 or later, which is beyond the traditional DLT
monitoring period. Overall, 1270 of 3517 patients (36%)
experienced drug-related dermatologic adverse events of
any type or body site in any cycle. Patients experienced
their worst drug-related dermatologic adverse event as follows: 743 patients (21.1%) in cycle 1, 303 (8.6%) in cycle
2, and 224 (6.4%) in cycle 3 or later. The proportions of
patients experiencing their worst grade adverse event by
cycle are depicted in Figure 3. This analysis investigated
the worst grade for the adverse event observed on study
with the caveat that 15% of patients went off study in
cycle 1 and >40% of patients went off study before the
end of cycle 2.
Cumulative Incidence of Drug-Related
Dermatologic Adverse Events

The cumulative incidence of drug-related dermatologic
adverse events is depicted by CTCAE grade in Figure 4A
and is summarized in Supporting Table 3 (see online supporting information). The cumulative incidence of grade
3 drug-related dermatologic adverse events was 1.6% at
Cancer

April 15, 2016

the end of cycle 1, 2% at the end of cycle 2, and 2.4% at
the end of cycle 6.
Drug-related dermatologic adverse events were most
common in patients who received only MTAs, followed
by those who received combination MTA and cytotoxic
therapy, then by those who received only cytotoxic agents
(P < .001), as illustrated in Figure 4B. In relation to dose
level (Fig. 4C), cumulative adverse events were significantly different (P < .001) between all 3 groups (high, intermediate, and low); however, no statistically significant
difference was observed in comparisons between the high
and intermediate groups (P 5 .3062).
In patients who received only MTAs on a phase 1
clinical trial, the cumulative incidence of drug-related dermatologic adverse events was significantly different when
separated by the number of drugs administered and the
type of MTA (Fig. 4D). Cumulative adverse events were
most common in patients who received combination kinase inhibitor-containing therapy, followed by combination nonkinase inhibitor-containing therapy, single-agent
kinase-inhibitor therapy, and single-agent nonkinase-inhibitor therapy (P < .001).
DISCUSSION
In this series of 127 trials that spanned the last decade, the
majority of patients received an MTA (41% received 1 or
more MTAs, and 40% received an MTA in combination
with a cytotoxic agent), representing a dramatic shift toward the use of targeted therapy. We demonstrate that the
adverse event profile of MTA therapy is distinct from that
of cytotoxic therapy, with a higher incidence of dermatologic adverse events across multiple categories and affecting multiple body sites. We previously demonstrated that
dermatologic adverse events of cancer therapy can represent a significant burden on quality of life and often necessitate treatment interruption and dose modification.16
As patterns of MTA use further shift toward more
chronic oral administration because of durable clinical
benefit,17 late toxicities figure more prominently as determinants of a tolerable dose and schedule.18 Our data support the finding that, in contrast to the traditional cycle-1
DLT monitoring period, a sizeable proportion of potential drug-related dermatologic DLTs were also captured if
both cycles 1 and 2 were taken into consideration. Of the
1270 patients who experienced any treatment-related dermatologic adverse event on a phase 1 clinical trial, only
743 experienced their worst grade adverse event within
cycle 1. In total, 303 patients experienced their worst
grade adverse event in cycle 2, followed by fewer patients
in each subsequent cycle, with 224 total patients

experiencing their worst grade dermatologic adverse event
in cycle 3 or later. Furthermore, the cumulative incidence
of grade 2 and grade  3 skin toxicity at the end of cycle
1 represented  2=3 of what it would eventually become by
the end of cycle 6.
When considering chronic, lower grade adverse
events using standard clinical trial designs, recommended
dosing and tolerability can often be overestimated.19
Although simply extending the DLT observation period
to capture these toxicities may not always be feasible,
methods that take into account adverse events from several treatment cycles should be considered, because they
have an effect on safety, tolerability, and requirements for
dose modification.18 Our data support previous retrospective series noting a substantial incidence of potential

DLTs of any type (both dermatologic and nondermatologic) occurring after the traditional DLT period on phase
1 clinical trials.12,20
This report is unique, however, in that we specifically evaluated the profile of drug-related dermatologic
adverse events on phase 1 clinical trials. A more granular,
toxicity-specific analysis like this can allow early phase
investigators to refine the description and classification of
organ system-related adverse events associated with the
administration of MTAs.21,22 Because even low-grade
adverse events can have a substantial impact on tolerability
and quality of life,23 the definition of dermatologic DLTs
should be standardized to include more comprehensive
descriptors and not only severity as described in the
CTCAE.14,21 For example, an acneiform rash may meet

DLT criteria not only if it covers >30% of the body surface area (grade 3) but also if it is less extensive (grade 2)
but persists for more than a prespecified amount of time.
Redefining safety and tolerability metrics in phase 1 trials
becomes particularly important as paradigms for accelerated drug approval are shifting toward focused, early
phase studies.24
In this series, the incidence of cumulative drugrelated dermatologic adverse events increased with
increasing dose. We acknowledge that some adverse
events, such as idiosyncratic reactions, may occur independent of dose. It is noteworthy that combinations of
kinase-inhibitor drugs had the highest incidence of dermatologic adverse events, followed by combination nonkinase inhibitor-containing regimens; the latter, in turn,
surpassed the cumulative adverse events of single-agent kinase inhibitors. We suggest taking this profile into
1234

account when considering rational combinations of
MTAs for clinical testing, because overlapping toxicity
profiles may prohibit reaching biologically effective doses
of 1 or more agents.25,26 In our opinion, beyond dose and
mechanism, another important argument that can be
made is that chronic and uninterrupted dosing in and of
itself may increase the incidence of nonallergic dermatologic toxicity. The continuous inhibition of mutated kinases may be the critical feature of MTA success, but this
can simultaneously lead to the exacerbation of skin toxicity. When feasible, a focus on intermittent dosing may
improve tolerability.
This report represents the largest description and
analysis to date of dermatologic adverse events occurring
on phase 1 clinical trials. All data for this review were prospectively collected, and individual patient-level data were

the limited ability to determine the duration of individual
toxicities and the number of drug-related dermatologic
adverse events that resulted in treatment interruption,
dose modification, or treatment discontinuation. In addition, an analysis of toxicity data in relation to differences
in schedule could not be conducted. We recognize the importance of these metrics, which should be explored in
future investigations. Although it was beyond the scope of
this study, it would have been interesting to determine
whether the dose ultimately approved for a drug or combination of drugs that had substantial toxicity after the
DLT period was lower than the recommended phase 2
dose identified in the phase 1 setting.
Conclusions

We demonstrate that a substantial proportion of drugrelated dermatologic adverse events occur after the traditional DLT period on phase 1 trials. The type and severity
of these dermatologic adverse events depends on the agent
or combination of agents chosen. Although independent
confirmation of these data would be valuable, we recommend that investigators consider evaluating dermatologic
toxicities in more than 1 cycle of therapy, because serious
drug-related toxicity can continue to occur after cycle 1.
Failure to account for this may lead to the adoption of
doses that are not tolerable in the long term.27
