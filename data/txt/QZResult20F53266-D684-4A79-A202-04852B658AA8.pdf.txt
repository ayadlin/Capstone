Abstract
The development of breast cancer resistance to endocrine therapy results from an increase in cellular plasticity
that permits the emergence of a hormone-independent tumor. The steroid coactivator protein SRC-1, through
interactions with developmental proteins and other nonsteroidal transcription factors, drives this tumor
adaptability. In this discovery study, we identiﬁed ADAM22, a non-protease member of the ADAM family of
disintegrins, as a direct estrogen receptor (ER)-independent target of SRC-1. We conﬁrmed SRC-1 as a regulator of
ADAM22 by molecular, cellular, and in vivo studies. ADAM22 functioned in cellular migration and differentiation,
and its levels were increased in endocrine resistant-tumors compared with endocrine-sensitive tumors in mouse
xenograft models of human breast cancer. Clinically, ADAM22 was found to serve as an independent predictor of
poor disease-free survival. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that SRC-1 switches steroid-responsive tumors to
a steroid-resistant state in which the SRC-1 target gene ADAM22 has a critical role, suggesting this molecule as a
prognostic and therapeutic drug target that could help improve the treatment of endocrine-resistant breast
cancer. Cancer Res; 72(1); 220–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen are the treatment of
choice for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors and,
although most patients initially respond to treatment, many
eventually relapse. At a molecular and cellular level, increased
tumor plasticity occurs in endocrine-resistant breast cancer in
comparison with endocrine-sensitive tumors (1). Alterations in
steroid receptor proﬁle observed in clinical studies between
primary and metastatic breast cancer, in particular with loss of
progesterone receptor status, support the phenomenon of
tumor adaptability in endocrine-resistant patients (2). These
alterations are marked by increased signaling through growth
factor networks and are driven, at least in part, through crosstalk between steroid and developmental pathways (3).

SRC-1 is central to the development of the endocrineresistant phenotype and is an independent predictor of
disease-free survival in tamoxifen-treated patients (4). As
a coactivator protein, SRC-1 does not directly interact with
the DNA but rather partners with other transcription factors
to regulate gene expression. Relative to endocrine-sensitive
tumors, increased SRC-1–ER-a interactions are observed in
patients who are resistant to treatment (4). As the tumor
progresses, however, increasing evidence suggests that SRC1 engages in transcriptional interactions independently
of ER.
Although initially described as a nuclear receptor coactivator protein, SRC-1 has been shown to interact with
transcription factors running downstream of an activated
mitogen—activated protein kinase pathway (5). These transcription factor interactions may represent one of the consequences of increased growth factor pathway signaling
described in endocrine resistance. Work from this group
and others has reported functional interactions between
SRC-1 and the Ets family of transcription factors, Ets-2 and
PEA3, and that this relationship is important in tumor
progression and the development of metastasis (6–9). This
occurs in part through SRC-1–mediated TWIST-suppressing
luminal markers such as E-cadherin and b-catenin during
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (7).
Using discovery tools, we investigated the signaling network
central to SRC-1–mediated endocrine resistance. We identiﬁed
a new ER-independent target of SRC-1, ADAM22. This disintegrin plays a role in endocrine-related tumor metastasis and
opens up new possibilities as a therapeutic target.

ADAM22 Is an SRC-1 Target and Mediates Cancer Metastasis

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
Endocrine-sensitive MCF7, metastatic MDA-MB-231, and
endocrine-insensitive SKBR3 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection and endocrine-resistant LY2 cells were
a kind gift from R. Clarke, Georgetown, DC (10). Cells were
grown as previously described (3). Letrozole-resistant cells
(LetR) were created by long-term treatment of overexpressing
aromatase MCF7 cells to letrozole (Novartis) as previously
described (3). Cells were maintained in steroid-depleted medium for 72 hours before treatment with hormones [estradiol
(E2), 108 mol/L; 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), 107 mol/L;
Sigma-Aldrich] over varying time periods. Primary cell cultures
derived from patient tumors were cultured for 72 hours prior to
experiments as described (3). All cell lines were tested (Source
Biosciences, Life Sciences) for authenticity in accordance with
American Type Culture Collection guidelines.
ChIP-sequencing and microarray analysis
To identify SRC-1 target genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq was conducted in endocrine-resistant LY2
cells that were treated with vehicle or tamoxifen (4-OHT) for 45
minutes and immunoprecipitated with anti-SRC-1 (sc-8995;
Santa Cruz) antibody. To estimate the background, an input
control, was included. Sequencing (35 base read length) was
carried out by Illumina using the Illumina Genome Analyzer
system as described previously, with technical replicates (3).
ChIP-seq results are based on the analysis of a single sample,
without biologic replicates. To identify functionally relevant
SRC-1 target genes, mRNA was hybridized to whole genome
expression arrays. LY2 cells were transfected with siSRC-1 or
scrambled siRNA. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, total
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer's instructions. Efﬁciency of knockdown was conﬁrmed
by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Microarray studies were conducted on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 arrays by Almac Diagnostics. DNase treatment, ampliﬁcation, fragmentation, labeling, hybridization, and array scanning were conducted by
Almac as per manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were
repeated in triplicates.
Bioinformatics analysis
Sequence reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19)
using Bowtie (11) allowing for 2 mismatches and discarding
reads with greater than a single mapping. ChIP peaks were
identiﬁed using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) with a
cutoff point of P < 1e-05 (12). Peaks were ﬁltered with a false
discovery rate (FDR) of either 5% or 1%. Analysis of
microarray data was conducted using the BioConductor (version 2.4) suite of R packages (13). Brieﬂy, data were preprocessed using gcrma (14) and an evident batch effect was
removed with the ComBat approach (15). Differential expression was assessed using linear modeling and variance shrinkage through the empirical Bayes framework implemented in
the LIMMA package (16). After correction for multiple hypothesis testing (17), probe sets with an adjusted value of P < 0.05
were selected as differentially expressed. To identify genes

containing an SRC-1 peak in the promoter and also displaying
differential expression in response to SRC-1 status, promoters
were deﬁned as 5 kbp of sequence upstream of RefSeq genes
and found those which contained an SRC-1 peak. We selected
the probe sets which were downregulated in the siSRC-1
samples, in both the presence and the absence of 4-OHT.
Affymetrix probe set ID's were mapped to RefSeq genes, and
the intersection of these sets was determined.
siRNA and plasmids
Predesigned siRNAs directed against SRC-1 (Ambion
AM16706;13631), AIB1 (Ambion AM 16706;116736), MYB
(Ambion AM 4392420;S9110), ADAM22 (Ambion 4390824;
S28739), ER-a (Ambion, 4392421;S4824), and a nontargeting
siRNA (Ambion, AM4635) were used to knockdown gene
expression. The pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing full-length
SRC-1 was used for overexpression studies and empty
pcDNA3.1 was used as a control plasmid.
Knockout mouse studies
Knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mammary tumor cell
lines were developed from primary tumors in SRC-1//PyMT
and WT/PyMT mice as described in the work of Qin and
colleagues (7).
qPCR
The mRNA levels of ADAM22 and SRC-1 were measured by
qPCR. RNA was extracted from 3 wild-type cell lines (WT1,
WT2, and WT3) derived from mammary tumors of WT/PyMT
mice and 3 independent knockout cell lines KO1, KO2, and KO3
derived from mammary tumors of SRC-1//PyMT mice. The
cDNA was prepared from 1 mg of RNA, and qPCR was carried
out using matched universal TaqMan probes and gene-speciﬁc
primers (Roche). Results are expressed as mean  SD, n ¼ 3.
Immunoblotting and coimmunoprecipitation
Immunoblotting for MYB, SRC-1, and ADAM22 was carried
out using rabbit anti-MYB (sc-517; Santa Cruz), anti-SRC-1 (sc8995; Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-ADAM22 (H00053616-B01;
MaxPab), respectively. Protein was immunoprecipitated with
rabbit anti-SRC-1 (sc-8995; Santa Cruz) and subsequently
blotted with anti-MYB.
ChIP studies
ChIP was carried out to conﬁrm SRC-1, MYB, and ER-a
recruitment to the ADAM22 promoter in either endocrineresistant LY2 or endocrine-sensitive MCF7 cells as previously
described (3). PCR was subsequently carried out with primers
corresponding to the ADAM22 promoter (forward GGACCTCACAGTCACGAGGT, reverse TCAGTGCTGCATTGTGCTTC).
Three-dimensional cultures
MCF7, LY2, and LetR cells were transfected with either
siADAM22 or scrambled nontargeting siRNA. Twenty-four
hours posttransfection, cells were harvested, 6  103 cells from
each cell line were mixed in 400 mL of medium and 2% Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) and subsequently seeded onto Matrigel
matrix in 8-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and cultured

for 14 days at 37 C/5% CO2. Cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton
X-100 for 10 minutes at 4 C. Cells were blocked in 10% goat
serum (DAKO) and 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were
stained with Phalloidin 594 (Molecular Probes) for 20 minutes
at room temperature and 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Slides were
mounted (DAKO) and examined by confocal microscopy.
Migration assay
Migration assays were carried out as previously described
(7).
Xenograft studies
Following ethical approval, 8-week-old female BALB/c SCID
mice (Harlan) were implanted with 17-B-estradiol pellets from
Innovative Research of America (0.25 mg/pellet, 60-day
release). One week later, 5  106 MCF7 or LY-2 cells mixed
with 50% Matrigel (BD biosciences) were implanted by intradermal injection on the rear dorsum. When the tumors reached
100 mm3, the mice were randomly assigned to either treatment
(tamoxifen 5 mg/pellet, 60-day release) or control group (placebo pellet). Tumors were measured weekly until they had
quadrupled in size at which point the animals were culled and
tumors were stored in RNA later for subsequent Western blot
analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted by calculating the
growth rate of each individual tumor and treatment condition
and analyzing them using an unpaired Student t test.
Tissue microarray/statistics
Patient breast tumor samples were collected the tissue
microarray (TMA) constructed and data recorded as previously described (18). TMA was immunostained using mouse
anti-ADAM22. Associations of ADAM22 with clinicopathologic
variables and SRC-1 were examined using Fisher exact test.
Kaplan–Meier graphs were used as an estimate of disease-free
survival. Statistical analyses were conducted using Minitab
software (Minitab) and values of P < 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant. Multivariate analysis was conducted using STATA
10 data analysis software (Stata Corp. LP) and Cox's proportional hazard model, using the Breslow method for ties.
Survival times between groups were compared using the
Wilcoxon test adjusted for censored values.
Accession codes
All ChIP-seq and expression array data are available from the
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under series entry
codes GSE28987 and GSE28645, respectively.

Results
Characterization of SRC-1 target genes in endocrineresistant breast cancer
To address how SRC-1 mediates tumor adaptability and
disease progression, we mapped SRC-1 transcriptional effects
in endocrine-resistant breast cancer. To this end, we combined
ChIP-seq/expression array analysis, molecular, cellular, and
translational studies to deﬁne new SRC-1 targets central to the

222

resistant phenotype. SRC-1-ChIP sequencing was conducted in
endocrine-resistant (LY2) cells. Treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen signiﬁcantly increased the number of ChIP-enriched
intervals identiﬁed (Fig. 1A). About 41% of peaks in the 4-OHT–
treated sample were close to the transcriptional start site, in
the promoter, ﬁrst exon, or upstream of the promoter (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, a signiﬁcant SRC-1-ChIP enrichment was
observed at the transcriptional start site in comparison with
the transcriptional termination site (Fig. 1C). As a deﬁned ER
coactivator, an overlap between ER-binding sites and those
identiﬁed for SRC-1 would be expected. In support of this, 4OHT induced SRC-1 recruitment to the classic ER target genes,
pS2, XBP1, and GREB1 in the endocrine-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Recently, examining SRC-3 ChIP DNA,
Lanz and colleagues reported that 28% of SRC-3 peaks (FDR <
1) in estrogen-treated MCF7 cells have their sequence centers
within 1 kbp of ER-binding sites (19). Here, using a modiﬁed
version of the p53 scan (20), we found 43% of high conﬁdence
SRC-1 peaks (FDR < 1) in 4-OHT–treated LY2 cells, contained
an ERE-binding motif within the peak (Fig. 1D). Though this
analysis is restricted to ERE motifs rather than total ER
binding, it raises the possibility that, in endocrine resistance,
SRC-1 can interact with transcription factors to drive transcription, independently of ER.
We carried out microarray experiments on LY2 cells transiently transfected with scrambled siRNA or SRC-1 siRNA,
untreated or treated with 4-OHT (Supplementary Fig. S1B) to
assess SRC-1–dependent gene expression. Combining the
ChIP-seq and expression array data sets, a total of 2,065 genes
were signiﬁcantly downregulated (P < 0.05) following SRC-1
knockdown and harbored a high conﬁdence SRC-1 peak in the
promoter region (Fig. 1E). We analyzed this list for novel
metastatic oncogenes that represent potential druggable targets. The metalloproteinase ADAM22 was selected for functional validation through a series of molecular, in vivo. and
translational studies. Interestingly, enrichment of SRC-1 at the
ADAM22 promoter was observed in the LY2 cells on treatment
with 4-OHT (Fig. 1F). Recruitment of SRC-1 to the ADAM22
promoter was conﬁrmed using standard ChIP analysis (Fig.
1G).
SRC-1 regulates ADAM22 in endocrine-resistant breast
cancer
We hypothesized that ADAM22 may be an effector of SRC-1–
mediated endocrine-resistant disease progression. Knockdown of SRC-1 in LY2 cells reduced ADAM22 protein expression and conversely, forced expression of SRC-1 in the sensitive
MCF7 cells increased ADAM22 expression (Fig. 2A). Knockdown of the p160, AIB1 had minor effects on ADAM22 expression in endocrine-resistant cells (Fig. 2A). In primary breast
tumors, a signiﬁcant association between transcript levels of
SRC-1 and ADAM22 was observed (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, cells
derived from mammary tumors of the SRC-1//PyMT mouse
lacked ADAM22 transcript, whereas high expression was evident in the wild-type PyMT mouse (Fig. 2C). Having established
a role for SRC-1 in the regulation of ADAM22 in breast cancer,
we addressed the question of whether or not this is ER
dependent.

breast cancers and is associated with ER-positive tumors.
Coimmunoprecipitation established that 4-OHT could drive
MYB–SRC-1 interactions in endocrine-resistant tumors (Fig.
2G). ChIP analysis indicated that neither SRC-1 nor MYB are
recruited to the ADAM22 promoter in the endocrine-sensitive
MCF7 cells. In endocrine-resistant cells however, both SRC-1
and MYB were recruited to the promoter in the presence of
estrogen and in particular 4-OHT (Fig. 2H). These ﬁndings
support the hypothesis that as disease progression occurs in

From bioinformatic studies, no ERE was observed in the
promoter region of ADAM22. In endocrine-resistant LY2 cells,
analyzing a 290-bp fragment of the ADAM22 promoter encompassing the SRC-1 peak, no recruitment of ER was observed, in
the presence of either estrogen or 4-OHT (Fig. 2D). Moreover,
knockdown of ER in LY2 cells did not alter ADAM22 expression
(Fig. 2E). Further analysis of the promoter revealed a binding
motif for the transcription factor MYB close to the SRC-1 peak
(Fig. 2F). MYB expression has been reported in 64% of primary

Supplementary Fig. S3B) and in the ER-negative MDA-MB231 (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Moreover, ADAM22 knockdown reverses the promigratory effects of 4-OHT observed in
the endocrine-resistant cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, in xenograft studies, expression of ADAM22 was absent from both
the 4-OHT–treated and untreated sensitive tumors and from
the untreated resistant tumors. Treatment with 4-OHT,
however, not only increased tumor volume in the resistant
tumors but also induced ADAM22 expression (Fig. 3D and
E). The neuronal protein, LGI1 serves as a speciﬁc extracellular ligand for ADAM22 (24). We found that treatment with
recombinant LGI1 reduced cellular migration in endocrineresistant cells in a similar manner to that observed with
knockdown of ADAM22 (Fig. 3F). These data raise the
distinct possibility of ADAM22 as a viable drug target for
the treatment of endocrine-resistant breast cancer.

ADAM22 predicts poor disease-free survival in breast
cancer patients
Previous molecular, in vivo, and clinical studies from this
group and others have established SRC-1 as a key mediator
of disease recurrence in endocrine-treated breast cancer
(4, 8, 9). To determine the signiﬁcance of the putative
SRC-1 target ADAM22 in mediating disease progression, we
examined its expression levels in a large cohort of patients
with breast cancer and compared this with classical clinicopathologic parameters. ADAM22 was found to localize to
the cell membrane of the tumor epithelial cells with strong
cytoplasmic staining also being observed (Fig. 4A). In this
cohort, expression of ADAM22 was found to signiﬁcantly
associate with SRC-1 (P ¼ 0.002) and also with disease
recurrence (P < 0.001; Table 1). In line with our bioinformatic, molecular, and in vivo studies, no association between

ADAM22 expression and ER was observed (Table 1). Kaplan–
Meier estimates of disease-free survival indicated that the
absence of ADAM22 is a strong predictor of disease-free
survival in breast cancer (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
in multivariate analysis using standard clinicopathologic
parameters as well as SRC-1 and ADAM22, both SRC-1 and
ADAM22 were found to be signiﬁcant independent predictors
of disease recurrence (ORs, 2.18 and 2.4, respectively; Table 2).
These clinical ex vivo data ﬁrmly support our molecular
observations that SRC-1 and its target ADAM22 can drive
tumor progression in endocrine-resistant breast cancer
(Fig. 5).

Discussion
Endocrine tumors can adapt to overcome targeted therapy.
There is now substantial evidence that the coactivator SRC-1 is
central to this process. Though other members of the p160
family have been investigated in endocrine-related cancer, it is
only SRC-1 that has been associated with the metastatic
phenotype (7). SRC-1, a member of the p160 family of steroid
coactivator proteins, is a master transcriptional regulator.
SRC-1 was recently identiﬁed as the gene with the strongest

selective pressure among ethnic populations analyzed by the
International HapMap Project (25), illustrating the importance
of the coactivator in human evolutionary adaptation. In this
study, we use discovery tools to identify new SRC-1 target
genes. Our intention was to uncover mechanisms of endocrinerelated tumor metastasis and identify biomarkers and drug
targets in this class.
ADAM22 was identiﬁed, and through a series of molecular
and in vivo studies, conﬁrmed as an SRC-1 target in endocrineresistant breast cancer. ADAMs are multidomain transmembrane glycoproteins that have a diverse role in physiology and
disease, with several members being targets for cancer therapy
(21). Although most members of the ADAM family are active
zinc metalloproteinases, 8 (including ADAM22) of 21 ADAMs
lack functional metalloproteinase domains and are implicated
in adhesion rather than membrane protein ectodomain shedding (26, 27). ADAM22 acts as a receptor on the surface of the
postsynaptic neuron to regulate signal transmission, but a
function for ADAM22 outside the nervous system has not been
described to date (24).
Despite its well-documented role as an ER coactivator
protein, evidence from ChIP-seq, bioinformatic, and molecular
studies reported here suggest that SRC-1 can regulate ADAM22
independently of ER. A steroid receptor–independent role for
SRC-1 is fast emerging. Interactions between SRC-1 and Ets
family proteins have been implicated in tumor progression and
the development of breast cancer metastasis (7–9). Furthermore, in the ER-negative PyMT SRC-1 knockout mouse model,
although SRC-1 is not required for mammary tumor initiation,
it is essential for the development of metastatic disease (28).
Here, examination of the ADAM22 promoter revealed a binding
motif for the transcription factor MYB. MYB is a proto-oncogene, though reports of its actions in breast cancer are limited,
a role for MYB in steroid regulation has been suggested in
several studies (reviewed in ref. 29). Although MYB alone had
no signiﬁcant effect on cell migration, results of our molecular
experiments suggest that SRC-1 can regulate ADAM22, at least
in part, through interaction with MYB, speciﬁcally in endocrine-resistant cells.
LGI1 acts as a speciﬁc extracellular ligand for the neuroreceptor ADAM22. It functions as a tumor suppressor of
glioblastoma and neuroblastoma and has recently been
shown to impair proliferation and survival in HeLa cells
(30–32). Both LGI1 and ADAM22 are genetically linked to
epilepsy, and the ligand/receptor complex has been suggested as a therapeutic target for synaptic disorders (24).
Treatment of breast cancer cells resistant to either 4-OHT or
letrozole, with recombinant LGI1, reduced cell migration.
The antimigratory action of LGI1 observed here is consistent
with the suppression of cell invasion observed in glioma cells
(30). LGI1 may function by inhibiting the extracellular disintegrin domain of ADAM22. Furthermore, in a signiﬁcant
cohort of patients with breast cancer, ADAM22, along with
SRC-1, was found to be an independent predictor of poor
disease-free survival. Taken together, these studies provide
strong evidence of ADAM22 as a mediator of metastasis and
as a potential drug target for the treatment of endocrinerelated metastatic disease.

SRC proteins are master regulators (33). SRC-1 through
interactions with developmental proteins can increase cellular
plasticity and enable tumors to adapt to endocrine therapy (3).
Discovery studies described here have uncovered a steroidindependent SRC-1–mediated network in endocrine-resistant
breast cancer, which has led to the identiﬁcation of a new SRC1 target, ADAM22. There is currently no effective treatment for
patients with endocrine-related tumor metastasis. ADAM22
represents a rational new therapeutic target with a robust
companion biomarker for the treatment of endocrine-resistant
tumors.
