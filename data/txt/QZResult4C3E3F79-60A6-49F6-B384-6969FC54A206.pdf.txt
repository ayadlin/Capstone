ABSTRACT:
Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) are non-curable diseases with a particularly poor prognosis.
Over the last decade, research has increasingly focused on the microenvironment
surrounding cancer cells, and its role in tumour development and progression. PDAC
and HCC differ markedly regarding their pathological features: PDAC are typically
stromal-predominant, desmoplastic, poorly vascularized tumours, whereas HCC are
cellular and highly vascularized. Despite these very different settings, PDAC and HCC
share transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) as a common key-signalling mediator,
involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and stroma-tumour
dialogue. Recently, novel drugs blocking the TGF-β pathway have entered clinical
evaluation demonstrating activity in patients with advanced PDAC and HCC. TGF-β
signalling is complex and mediates both pro- and anti-tumoural activities in cancer
cells depending on their context, in space and time, and their microenvironment. In
this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of the TGF-β pathway
and its deregulation in PDAC and HCC development and progression at the cellular and
microenvironment levels. We also summarize key preclinical and clinical data on the
role of TGF-β as a target for therapeutic intervention in PDAC and HCC, and explore
perspectives to optimize TGF-β inhibition therapy

liver disease, portal thrombosis and/or massive tumour
involvement[3]. Treatment options are limited for both
malignancies with only a minority of PDAC and HCC
patients being candidates for surgery due to disease
extent and/or liver dysfunction. Advanced PDAC is a
contender for cytotoxic-based therapies (gemcitabine, nabpaclitaxel, or combined 5-FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin as the
FOLFIRINOX regimen), while sorafenib, an oral multityrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the VEGFR, PDGFR
and Raf pathways is the only approved systemic therapy
for advanced HCC patients[4, 5]. Both PDAC and HCC
are clearly therapeutically challenging digestive cancers
and new therapeutic options are urgently needed.

Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have
remarkably poor prognosis. Synchronous metastases are
identified in 50% of PDAC patients at diagnosis[1] and
preclinical models suggest that metastatic dissemination,
the leading cause of PDAC-related death, might exist
even before the primary tumour is detectable[2]. Unlike
PDAC, HCCs are mostly locoregional-spreading
tumours, with extra-hepatic metastases being a late
event. Mortality is closely related to liver dysfunction
or portal hypertension complications due to underlying

PDAC and HCC differ markedly regarding their
pathological features: PDAC are typically stromalpredominant, desmoplastic, poorly vascularized tumours,
whereas HCC are cellular and highly vascularized[1, 6].
Despite these contrasting microenvironment settings,
PDAC and HCC share transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-β) as a common key signalling mediator. TGF-β is
involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
invasion, and stroma-tumour dialogue in both tumour
types.
In the first part of this review, we provide a
comprehensive overview of the roles played by the
TGF-β pathway and its deregulation in PDAC and
HCC development and progression, at the cellular and
microenvironment levels. We then go on to summarize
key preclinical and clinical data describing the role of

TGF-β as a target for therapeutic intervention in PDAC
and HCC, and explore perspectives to optimize TGF-β
inhibition therapy.

2.ROLE OF TGF-Β AT THE CELLULAR
LEVEL
2.1. TGF-β pathway in a nutshell
TGF-β is a well-recognised actor of development
and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation,
differentiation, invasion, and inflammation. Key features
of the TGF-β signalling pathway are depicted in figure
1. Deletion of the TGFβ1 or TGFβRII gene in mice
resulted in defects in haematopoiesis, vasculogenesis,
and endothelial differentiation of extra-embryonic tissues,
while knockout mice for SMAD2 or SMAD4 displayed

Figure 1: Canonical and non-canonical TGF-β pathways. In the canonical pathway, the three TGF-β ligand isoforms, TGF-β1,

TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, are synthesized as precursors and bind to form the latent TGF-β complex before being secreted[138]. After extracellular
activation, TGF-β ligands bind to the membranous TGF-β type III receptor or the TGF-β type II receptor (TGF-βRII) homodimers with
high affinity. TGF-βRII binding allows dimerization with TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-βRI) homodimers, activation of the TGF-βRI kinase
domain and signal transduction via phosphorylation of the C-terminus of receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMAD), SMAD2 and SMAD3.
The TGF-βR dimer then forms a heterotrimeric complex with SMAD4 which translocates and accumulates in the nucleus[139, 140]. TGF-β
dependent signalling can activate or repress hundreds of target genes through the interaction of SMADs with various transcription factors
(TF). SMAD activities are regulated through several mechanisms: SMAD2/3 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, binding to anchor proteins such
as SARA, phosphorylation (e.g., by ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK), Smurf (SMAD-ubiquitination-regulatory factor)-dependent degradation,
or via expression of inhibitory SMAD6 and SMAD7[141]. In the non-canonical pathway, TGF-β signalling activates SMAD-independent
pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK) as well as NF-κB, Rho/Rac1, Cdc42, FAK, Src, Abl[142].
Moreover, transversal signalling, especially at the SMAD level, allows TGF-β pathway activation to integrate signals from integrins, Notch,
Wnt, TNF-α, or EGF-dependent pathways as well as signals from cellular processes such as the cell cycle or apoptosis machineries[143]. The
TGF-β signalling pathway thus has pleiotropic functions regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, cell motility, extracellular matrix
production, angiogenesis and cellular immune response[144].

abnormal mesoderm formation[7]. Mice knockout for
TGFβ1, TGFβRII, or SMAD4 genes are more likely to
have spontaneous tumour development and excessive
inflammatory responses, confirming the tumour suppressor
properties of the TGF-β pathway[7]. In humans, mutations
in the TGFβRII gene have been associated with multiple
syndromes, and SMAD4 mutation is genetically
responsible for familial juvenile polyposis, an autosomal
dominant disease characterized by predisposition to
gastrointestinal polyps and cancers.
Hijacking crucial biological functions by
deregulating the TGF-β signalling pathway has
recently emerged as a leading area of preclinical and
clinical cancer research. The TGF-β pathway has
both pro- and anti-tumoural activities[8-10]. On one
hand, the TGF-β pathway promotes cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis, and autophagy in epithelial cells, and also
inhibits inflammation[8-10]. On the other hand, by
promoting angiogenesis, cell motility, invasion, EMT,
or cell stemness, the TGF-β pathway promotes tumour
progression[8-10]. The current paradigm for the role of
TGF-β in carcinogenesis is that accumulation of genetic
alterations in the TGF-β pathway drives the pathway’s
evolution from tumour-suppressive to tumour-promoting
functions[9]. However, as we discuss in this review, it is
critical not to isolate the role of TGF-β in tumour cells
from their context in space and time, and from their
microenvironment.

analyses of their prognostic value are conflicting and no
consensus has been reached[27].
Downstream of the TGF-β receptors, mutations in
SMAD2 and SMAD3 genes are infrequent and reports on
the prognostic value of their expression level in PDAC
and HCC are sparse [COSMIC Database]. In patients
with hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus chronic infection,
the phospho-SMAD2/3 L isoform was associated with
a higher risk of developing HCC[28, 29]. SMAD4
inactivation is one of the most common alterations
in PDAC (50-60%), caused by deletion, mutation or
epigenetic modification, and many studies have shown
that loss of SMAD4 expression is associated with a worse
prognosis[30-32]. For instance, in a genetic analysis of 39
frequent mutations in 89 patients with resected PDAC,
SMAD4 mutations were significantly associated with
shorter survival[33]. In the largest study to date by Bachet
et al.[34], loss of SMAD4 expression had no prognostic
value but was predictive of adjuvant gemcitabine benefit.
These apparently conflicting results may arise from the
different techniques used to evaluate SMAD4 alterations
and differences in patient populations and treatments.
In HCC, SMAD4 mutations are uncommon (> 2%)
[COSMIC Database]. However, there are also reports
of reduced SMAD4 expression in HCC cells compared
to surrounding liver tissue[35]. In contrast, increased
expression was reported in subsets of patients with chronic
viral hepatitis infection or in association with increased
TGF-βRII overexpression, and was linked with poor
prognosis[35-37]. Emerging data regarding inhibitory
SMADs (I-SMAD) showed that low levels of SMAD7
correlated with increased recurrence and shorter survival
in PDAC and HCC patients[38, 39].

2.2. TGF-β pathway alterations in tumour cells
Alterations in TGF-β signalling are common
in cancer. The TGF-β pathway is one of the 12 central
cellular signalling pathways and processes that are
frequently genetically altered in PDAC[11]. Regarding
the TGF-β ligand, TGF-β mutations are very uncommon
and to date none have been reported in PDAC or HCC
[COSMIC Database]. TGF-β1 expression is detected
immunohistochemically in about 40% of PDACs, and
high TGF-β1 plasma levels have been measured in HCC
patients compared to patients with cirrhosis only, with
decreasing levels in patients who underwent effective
HCC therapy[12-15]. Several studies have evaluated the
prognostic significance of TGF-β levels in both PDAC and
HCC[15-23]. However, published results are conflicting
and no real consensus currently exists. For TGF-β
receptors, TGFβRI gene alterations are uncommon (<
2%), whereas mutations in the TGFβRII gene are present
at high frequencies in some cancers including HCC.
Higher rates are found in poorly differentiated HCC
tumours (53% of cases), but mutations are infrequent in
PDAC (4%) [COSMIC Database][24, 25]. Low levels of
TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII and TGF-βRIII have been observed
and may be associated with poor prognosis in various
cancers[26]. However, similar to TGF-β ligand levels,

The role of the TGF-β pathway in carcinogenesis
is currently controversial. In its primary function, TGF-β
has major tumour-suppressive properties, suggesting that
TGF-β pathway inactivation is mandatory for tumour cell
growth[9, 10]. In PDAC, mutation-driven KRAS overactivation is a very early alteration present in almost all
tumours. Isolated expression of activated KRAS in mice
drives the formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PanIN) and PDAC, however lesion progression is slow,
and TGF-β pathway activation is sustained[40, 41].
SMAD4 or TGFβRII deletion in KRASG12D transgenic
mice dramatically increased tumour aggressiveness, with
accelerated PanIN and PDAC development, suggesting
cooperation between these genetic alterations and mutant
KRAS[42-44]. The importance of SMAD4 loss-offunction in PDAC carcinogenesis is supported by the fact
that SMAD4 inactivation is observed in most tumours.

2.4. TGF-β pathway in promoting metastasis

In the context of tumour progression, SMAD4 loss-offunction may not only be necessary for counteracting
TGF-β anti-proliferative effects, but may also contribute
to rewiring the cells’ processing system, translating TGF-β
input signals into different outputs. In in vitro and in vivo
experiments, adding TGF-β to SMAD4-null cell lines
resulted in increased proliferation rather than tumour
suppression[45].
In HCC, the low frequency of SMAD4 inactivation
implies that different mechanisms are engaged in eliciting
TGF-β inhibitory functions. The current paradigm,
supported by studies involving expression of TGF-β
pathway components in patient tissues, is that early
carcinogenesis relies on low TGF-β pathway activity
or “early TGF-β signature”[46, 47]. Early TGF-β
pathway attenuation is characterized by activation of a
negative feedback loop through increased expression of
the I-SMAD SMAD7, and expression of two negative
regulators of the TGF-β pathway, the SKI-like and TGFβ-induced factor genes, which are both co-repressors of
the SMAD2/3-dependent transcription complex[46].
This early TGF-β signature is also characterized by
expression of the DNA damage gene family Gadd45,
which is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis[46,
48]. Given this strong induction of anti-tumourigenic
genes, early tumour promoting activity of TGF-β requires
a cellular context with imbalanced sensitivity towards
pro- and anti-growth signals. For example, p16INK4 gene
alterations are present in up to 90% of HCCs. They favour
insensitivity to anti-growth signals by affecting both the
cell cycle through relieving cyclin D/CDK4,6 complex
inhibition, and the apoptotic machinery by lowering p53
activation[32]. Similarly, over-activation of pro-mitogenic
pathways such as EGFR, or TGF-β-dependent cytokine
expression (EGF, PDGF, IGF-1, HGF, FGF, etc.) may
modify TGF-β response. For example, the Ras-ERK
pathway can transduce signals downstream of TGF-βR,
and ERK may modify SMAD-dependent signalling by
modulating SMAD2/3 phosphorylation. SMADs are
differentially phosphorylated by TGF-βR (C-terminal
region) and ERK (linker L region), resulting in various
phosphoisoforms (C, L, L/C) with distinct localization
and cellular effects[49]. Hyperactivation of the PI3K/
AKT pathway also cooperates with the TGF-β pathway in
hepatocarcinogenesis in cirrhotic livers[50].
To summarize, in early steps of carcinogenesis,
TGF-β displays tumour-suppressive properties, with
mechanistic differences between PDAC and HCC
models. In PDAC, the TGF-β pathway initially drives
anti-proliferative signals until SMAD4 silencing occurs,
modifying the outputs of TGF-β pathway activation. In
HCC, the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β are bypassed
via mitogenic signals or impaired sensitivity to antigrowth signals.

Most tumours acquire a metastatic phenotype
during progression, developing the capacity to invade
surrounding tissues, migrate and grow at distant sites
via an EMT-dependent process. This process is linked
to dedifferentiation, and epithelial cells undergo a
phenotypic shift from having tight cell-cell junctions,
clear basal and apical polarity, sheet-like growth
architecture, with expression of epithelial markers such
as E-cadherin, into spindle-like fusiform, motile cells
expressing mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and
N-cadherin. This change in morphology and remodelling
of the extracellular matrix (ECM), notably through
the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
confers them with invading potential. Accumulating
evidence shows that TGF-β has late-stage tumour effects
particularly in promoting EMT and, as a consequence,
cancer dissemination[9, 10].
Coulouarn et al.[46] showed that high TGF-β
pathway activity with the “late TGF-β signature” favours
late tumourigenic evolution in HCC, notably in terms of
metastatic spreading. It is characterized by modulation
of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization (e.g.,
vimentin and supervillin), cell adhesion (e.g., integrin-α6
and activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule), and
matrix remodelling and migration, along with expression
of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and Rhob[46,
48, 51]. Interestingly, this late TGF-β signature is also
characterized by the expression of the SNAI1 gene which
encodes Snail, an E-cadherin transcription repressor[46,
48]. In addition, TGF-β is a major actor in EMT in PDAC,
and cooperates with the activated Ras-ERK pathway
to activate EMT transcription factors such as Snail and
ZEB[32, 52].
Moreover, in both PDAC and HCC, TGF-β
promotes tumour invasiveness through MMP induction.
For example, MMP-2, MMP-9, MT-MMP1 and
urokinase-like plasminogen activator are up-regulated in
vitro by TGF-β1[53-55]. TGF-β1 inhibition reduces MMP
production and cell invasiveness, possibly via partial EMT
reversion, inhibition of integrin signalling, and reduced
CTGF production[51, 56, 57].
In both PDAC and HCC, mesenchymal
differentiation of tumour cells has been associated with
poor prognosis, while TGF-β expression or TGF-β
pathway activation correlates with the EMT status of
tumour cells. In a recent analysis of a series of resected
HCC specimens, a mesenchymal phenotype (high
vimentin and low E-cadherin expression) was associated
with shorter survival and enhanced TGF-β pathway
activity (increased TGF-β1, phospho-SMAD-2, and
phospho-β1 integrin expression)[58].
Crosstalk and TGF-β coupling with other signalling
pathways may be critically important for tumour

progression. As essential components of cell-to-matrix
adhesion, integrins are involved in modulating the TGF-β
response. In PDAC, αVβ6 integrin cooperates with TGF-β
in its tumour-suppressor function whereas in HCC, αVβ1
integrins or α3β1 integrins are stimulated by TGF-β to
promote tumour invasion[16, 56, 59]. TGF-β can activate
and cooperate with multiple other pathways involved in
invasion and metastasis (e.g., MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
NF-κB, Notch, Wnt, and CXCR4) through SMAD2/3dependent and -independent signalling mechanisms[60].
For instance, in HCC, co-activation of the Wnt and
TGF-β pathways define an HCC subclass with a more
aggressive phenotype, and in PDAC SMAD4 was required
to transduce Wnt signalling in a SMAD2/3-independent
manner[61-63]. In contrast to early carcinogenesis,
the presence of SMAD4 seems to be important for the
metastatic potential of PDAC tumour cells in vivo[40].
Activation of the Ras-ERK and TGF-β-SMAD4 pathways
was required for EMT induction and maintenance[52].
Mutated K-Ras and TGF-β cooperate to produce L/C
forms of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3, which
are translocated into the nucleus and activate transcription
of pro-proliferative (c-Myc) and pro-invasive (MMPs)
genes[49].
To summarize, TGF-β plays an important role in
both PDAC and HCC in late-stage tumour progression
by promoting EMT, invasion, and, as a result, cancer
metastasis, in cooperation with other pathways.

3. ROLE OF TGF-Β AT
MICROENVIRONMENT LEVEL

β1-transfected PDAC cells and fibroblasts, and also when
fibroblasts were grown in conditioned medium from TGFβ1-transfected PDAC cells. In vivo, TGF-β1-transfected
PDAC cells induced a rich stroma after orthotopic
transplantation into nude mice pancreas. Consistent with
this, Bachem et al.[72] showed that PDAC cell lines
stimulated PSC proliferation. Using specific neutralizing
antibodies, they demonstrated that the increase in ECM
protein production was mediated by TGF-β1 and FGF2,
while PSC proliferation was likely mediated by PDGF.
In addition, after subcutaneous injection of combined
PDAC cells and PSCs into immunodeficient mice,
tumours grew faster than with PDAC cells injected alone.
On histologic examination, mixed PSCs-PDAC cells
tumours displayed intense desmoplastic reaction, but
also an increased number of cancer cells themselves[72].
Additional studies, using other physiological orthotopic
and transgenic mice models, also demonstrated that human
PSCs within the tumour stimulated ﬁbrosis, local tumour
growth, and importantly, promoted regional and distant
metastasis[73-75]. Strikingly, PSCs were also detected
in metastatic nodules in the liver in mice, suggesting
that PSCs can migrate with PDAC cells to establish a
potentially tumour-favourable microenvironment at distant
sites[73, 76]. Taken together, these data highlight the
crucial role of the interactions between cancer cells and
PSCs in tumour progression in PDAC, via TGF-β1 and
desmoplasia[77, 78].
PSCs not only create a fibrotic microenvironment,
but also contribute to make it hypoxic. Although activated
PSCs produce pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, they
are dominantly anti-angiogenic, through (1) enhancing
anti-angiogenic endostatin production by PDAC cells,
(2) compressing vessels by the dense and fibrotic stroma
and (3) high interstitial pressure, all of which result in
low vascularization and tumour hypoxia[64, 79]. In
addition, hypoxia stimulates pro-fibrogenic functions of
PSCs (production of ECM components and CTGF), thus
perpetuating a hypoxia-fibrosis vicious cycle[80-82].
Avascular hypoxic microenvironments promote survival
of anaerobic cancer cells that are intrinsically resistant
to hypoxia-induced apoptosis[83]. This may explain
the failure of anti-angiogenic treatment in PDAC[64,
84]. Moreover, hypoxia may select for tumour cells
with a more aggressive phenotype[85], a well described
phenomenon in other tumour types[86, 87]. This may
be due to hypoxia-induced activation of EMT and
invasion pathways such as HGF/c-Met or CXCR4/
CXCL12, through HIF-1α-dependent and independent
mechanisms[88-93]. Hypoxia-induced modulations
of tumour metabolism (glycolysis, glutaminolysis,
lactate efflux) may additionally contribute to increased
aggressiveness[93]. The TGF-β pathway cooperates with
hypoxia in these processes[94]. In preclinical studies,
TGF-β inhibition by various agents (LY2109761, SD-208,

THE

3.1. PDAC: stromal avascular microenvironment
PDAC displays the most prominent desmoplastic
stromal reaction of all epithelial tumours, often greater
than the epithelial component of the tumour itself[1, 64,
65]. Fibrotic focus (evidence of intratumoural fibroblast
proliferation following focal necrosis) and stromal
abundance and activity (evaluated by collagen deposition
and α-smooth actin immunostaining) correlated with
poorer survival in resected PDAC patients, suggesting a
prognostic role for desmoplasia in PDAC[66-69]. This
desmoplastic stroma is a complex structure composed of
ECM proteins and various cell types including pancreatic
stellate cells (PSCs), endothelial cells and pericytes,
nerve cells, immune cells, and bone marrow-derived stem
cells[68].
Activated PSCs are responsible for excess ECM
production in PDAC, and TGF-β1 is a key signalling
factor in this process[70]. Löhr et al.[71] demonstrated
that TGF-β1 overexpression induced up-regulation of
ECM proteins in vitro in co-culture experiments in TGF-

and trabedersen) reduced PDAC cells invasion in vitro
and metastasis in vivo[95-97]. Consequently, PSCs and
TGF-β1 in PDAC desmoplasia may contribute to create a
hypoxic microenvironment exerting a selection pressure
toward a more invasive cancer cell phenotype.
To summarize, TGF-β is a major pro-fibrotic
factor in PDAC carcinogenesis. TGF-β therapeutic
inhibition in PDAC might thus result in stromal depletion,
vascularization enhancement with improved drug delivery,
and an anti-metastatic effect. An anti-fibrogenic effect has
yet to be well studied due to the lack of relevant preclinical
models mimicking the stromal complexity of PDAC[64].

a high stromal content and CTGF expression, which was
inhibited by treatment with LY2109761. Blocking TGF-β
signalling with LY2109761 inhibited CTGF synthesis and
release from HCC cells (and CAFs) and reduced tumour
stromal content by inhibiting CAF proliferation[51].
Inhibiting this pro-fibrogenic role of TGF-β may be
of particular interest in forms of HCC exhibiting dense
stroma such as fibrolamellar HCC, similar to PDAC.
Overall, TGF-β promotes HCC vascularization,
with an important role of VEGF and CTGF as paracrine
mediators. TGF-β inhibition may mainly have an antiangiogenic role in HCC.

3.3. TGF-β in PDAC and HCC cancer
microenvironment: immune system deregulation

The role of TGF-β signalling is quite different
in the HCC microenvironment. In contrast to PDAC,
HCCs are typically hypervascularized tumours with
predominant arterial perfusion[98, 99]. Angiogenesis
plays an important role in HCC development and growth
as suggested by high circulating VEGF levels and
pathological studies showing the development of unpaired
arteries, increased histological microvessel density, and
VEGF immunostaining on tissue biopsies[100-102].
Consistent with this, HCCs are responsive to intra-arterial
embolization and anti-angiogenic agents such as sorafenib
or sunitinib, suggesting angiogenic dependence[98].
TGF-β plays a pro-tumourigenic role in HCC mainly
by promoting angiogenesis[103]. Ito el al.[104] showed
that TGF-β plasma levels were positively correlated
with tumour vascularity assessed by celiac angiography.
TGF-β signalling can induce angiogenic factors such as
VEGF and CTGF in epithelial cells and the fibroblasts that
promote these epithelial cells[105]. Mazzocca et al.[106]
demonstrated that the TGF-βRI inhibitor LY2109761
displayed anti-angiogenic activity by inhibiting VEGF
secretion. Mechanistically, LY2109761 blocked
paracrine crosstalk between HCC cells and endothelial
cells involving SMAD2/3-mediated signalling, and
consequently the formation of blood vessels. Interestingly,
this anti-angiogenic effect was more effective than that of
bevacizumab, a specific anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody.
In addition, TGF-β-mediated CTGF production is
also involved in ECM deposition in HCC, despite that
HCC stromal content is much less abundant than in PDAC.
CTGF plays an important role in the crosstalk between
HCC cells and HSCs (or cancer-associated fibroblasts,
CAFs) to control stroma production[51]. TGF-β
circulating levels increase in line with collagen deposition
and the reduction of ECM degradation[107]. The Gianelli
group[51] showed that HCC cell lines producing high
levels of CTGF generated high stromogenic tumours,
which was reversed by CTGF knock-down. Upon TGF-β1
stimulation, low-CTGF HCC cells formed tumours with

Many lines of preclinical evidence suggest that
TGF-β plays a crucial role in immune regulation[108,
109]. The immune system is responsible for the early
detection and destruction of cancer cells. Some cancer
cells become immunologically invisible by passive
avoidance of immune surveillance (i.e., cancer cell
“hiding”). Another mechanism for escaping immune
surveillance is to actively secrete cytokines that “blind”
the immune system to the presence of abnormal antigens
at the cancer cell surface. TGF-β1 is the most potent
immunosuppressor and plays a crucial role in this process.
TGF-β1-null mice exhibit a phenotype of excessive
inflammatory response and early death, with multifocal
inflammatory disease in many tissues and massive tissue
infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages[110, 111].
Interestingly, marked immunosuppression is observed in
patients with PDAC or HCC[112]. Tumour-associated
TGF-β1 downregulates the host immune response via
several mechanisms: it (1) drives the T-helper (Th)
balance toward the Th2 immune phenotype via IL-10 as
an intermediate; (2) directly inhibits anti-tumoural Th1type responses and M1-type macrophages; (3) suppresses
cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes, natural killer lymphocytes
and dendritic cells functions; (4) generates CD4+CD25+
T-regulatory cell (T-regs) that suppress activity of
other lymphocyte populations; (5) promotes M2-type
macrophages with pro-tumoural activity mediated by
secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., IL-10,
TGF-β), pro-angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF, MMP-9,
CXC chemokines), pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL6, TNFα, IL-1), and tumour growth factors, and generates
reactive oxygen species with genotoxic activity[109, 113115].
Together, these data suggest that TGF-β
overexpression in PDAC and HCC generates a favourable
immune microenvironment for tumour growth, and that
TGF-β inhibition may contribute to restore anti-tumoural
cytotoxic immune response. The effects of TGF-β

the immune microenvironment toward immunosuppression and inappropriate inflammation.

carcinoma and malignant melanoma, and is currently in
phase I in metastatic breast cancer in association with
radiotherapy. LY2382770, targeting TGF-β1, is currently
being evaluated in diabetic kidney conditions but not in
oncology.
Trabedersen (AP12009) is an antisense
oligonucleotide targeting TGF-β2. In preclinical models,
it displayed potent anti-tumour efficacy in TGF-β2overexpressing PDAC cells, and drastically inhibited cell
invasion, and also inhibited tumour growth, angiogenesis
and lymph node metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft
mouse model of metastatic PDAC[97]. It is currently
in phase II development in glioblastoma. In a phase I/II
study, a cohort of nine advanced PDAC patients received
intravenous trabedersen (140 mg/m²/day, 4 days on/10
days off) as second-line therapy. Toxicities were limited
and survival analysis showed a remarkable median overall
survival of 13.4 months. One patient with liver metastasis
had a complete response[116]. No clinical data are
available in HCC to date.
Lucanix (belagenpumatucel-L) is a TGF-β2
antisense gene-modified allogeneic tumour cell vaccine
that has completed phase II evaluation and is currently in
a phase III study against placebo in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients as maintenance therapy after
front-line treatment[117]. Phase II results showed good
tolerance and a survival rate of 47% in stage IIIB and IV

4. TGF-Β AT THE PATIENT LEVEL:
TGF-Β PATHWAY INHIBITORS IN THE
CLINIC
Many TGF-β pathway inhibitors have been
investigated in the preclinical setting, some of which
are now in clinical development targeting either TGF-β
ligands (TGF-β1, -β2, -β3) or receptors (TGF-βRI and
TGF-βRII) (table 1). Nonetheless, very few of these
inhibitors have been tested in the context of HCC or
PDAC.

4.1. Inhibitors of TGF-β ligands
Four humanized monoclonal antibodies have
been developed against TGF-β ligands, however data
are not available in HCC and PDAC. Two antibodies,
lerdelimumab directed against TGF-β2 and metelimumab
directed against TGF-β1, were stopped for lack of efficacy
before being evaluated in oncology. Fresolimumab,
a pan-TGF-β antibody still under investigation, has
completed phase II studies in glioma and relapsed
malignant pleural mesothelioma, phase I in renal cell

NSCLC patients[117]. Lucanix has not yet been evaluated
in PDAC or HCC.
Disitertide (P144) is a peptidic TGF-β1 inhibitor
specifically designed to block the interaction with its
receptor. In a mouse model of metastatic colorectal
carcinoma, P144 inhibited tumour growth, liver
metastasis, EMT and angiogenesis[118]. Phase I studies
of topical application for skin fibrosis are completed but it
is yet to be evaluated in oncology.

in vitro is a far from optimal representation of in vivo
circumstances. Compared to an in vivo setting, cells
grown on two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture substrates
differ markedly in their morphology, differentiation, and
cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions[122, 123].
TGF-β effects can also differ considerably according
to the features of the culture system used, e.g. its rigidity,
composition, and structure[10]. Dedifferentiation was
seen in hepatocytes grown on monolayers of dried stiff
collagen, caused by a specific signalling network triggered
by the ECM, activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) via
Src, which in turn activated Akt, causing resistance to
TGF-β-induced apoptosis by antagonizing p38[124]. In
contrast, FAK was not activated when hepatocytes were
grown on a softer collagen gel, keeping them sensitive to
TGF-β-induced apoptosis. In the PDAC COLO-357 cell
line, Sempere et al.[125] showed that TGF-β had antiproliferative effects on PDAC cells cultured on standard
plastic plates or in soft agar, while it promoted cell growth
in a three-dimensional (3D) culture system. These limits
of classic 2D in vitro culture models may explain some
of the discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo models
evaluating TGF-β functioning.
Moreover, TGF-β is a paracrine-signalling molecule
mediating interactions between cancer cells and stromal
cells, including stellate cells. In vitro co-culture systems
of cancer and stromal cells grown within or on top of
reconstituted ECM gels are able to model cancer more
realistically than 2D systems. These “organotypic
cultures” were first described for human skin cancer and
have been exploited to investigate various tumour types,
including ovarian, breast, prostate and oesophageal,
providing important insights into the role of frequently
altered genes in biological behaviour and mechanisms of
tumour invasion[126]. Such models may provide a more
accurate prediction of the in vivo situation and may be
useful to study the effects of TGF-β and TGF-β inhibition.
There are many clinical challenges to developing
TGF-β inhibitors, notably patient selection, timing of
treatment and predictive biomarkers. Given the dual
effects of TGF-β on proliferation, TGF-β inhibition
may only be beneficial in tumours expressing the
“late TGF-β signature” (i.e. promoting proliferation
and invasiveness)[9, 46]. More so than tumour cell
characteristics, predictive power of biomarkers in terms
of TGF-β inhibitor efficacy may be affected by the tumour
microenvironment or a patient’s overall blood biomarker
profile. For example, patients with high intra-tumoural
and/or circulating levels of TGF-β may be more likely
to respond to specific TGF-β inhibitors. Thus, TGF-β
inhibition (i.e., by inhibitors of TGF-β ligands) may be
used to normalize tissue homeostasis by down-regulating
excess TGF-β production of tumour and tumour-related
tissues, with limited side effects on normal tissues. This
raises the question of the timing and context in which
TGF-β inhibition would be most beneficial. TGF-β

4.2. Inhibitors of TGF-β receptors
LY3022859 (IMC-TR1) is a monoclonal antibody
against TGF-βRII that has just entered phase I clinical trial
in patients with advanced solid tumors. No data are yet
available in HCC or PDAAC
LY2157299 is a small molecule inhibitor of TGFβRI. To date, it is the most advanced TGF-β signalling
inhibitor under clinical development in HCC and
PDAC. In preclinical models, LY2157299 has antitumour activity in NSCLC, breast and HCC models,
affecting mainly tumour migration and invasion rather
than proliferation[119]. In a triple-negative breast cancer
xenograft model, TGF-β inhibition was synergistic with
chemotherapy preventing the development of cancer
stem cells[120]. Phase I evaluation showed a good
safety profile and durable responses beyond one year in
three patients. Several Phase II studies with LY2157299
are ongoing, including as second-line treatment in HCC
after sorafenib (NCT01246986), in association with
gemcitabine in advanced PDAC (NCT01373164), as
well as in glioblastoma. Preliminary results of the HCC
phase II were presented at the ASCO and ILCA 2013
meeting[121]; 106 patients have been randomized to
receive LY2157299 at 160 or 300 mg/day. LY2157299
safety profile was suitable for patients with Child-Pugh
A/B7 HCC. Median time to progression was 12 weeks.
LY2157299 treatment was associated with AFP responses,
reduction in TGF-β1 and E-cadherin levels, and time to
tumor progression was increased in patients with AFP and
TGF- β1 levels reduction from baseline. Further analysis is
expected to confirm the signal to launch phase III clinical
trials in patients with PDAC and/or HCC.

5. PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSIONS
The future of TGF-β-directed therapies is promising.
However, many questions remain to be answered before
optimal clinical use of these agents in PDAC and HCC is
reached. At a fundamental level, there is a crucial need for
pertinent and robust PDAC and HCC preclinical models to
study the effects of the TGF-β pathway and its inhibition.
Both these tumours have complex microenvironments in
which cancer cells interact closely with ECM components
and different cell types. Studying cancer cells in isolation

inhibition may be of particular interest as a preventive
strategy in HCC, in which TGF-β overproduction, as a
driver of the fibrotic process of cirrhosis, precedes tumour
formation and create a favourable microenvironment for
tumour cells[9]. This may be useful both in the primary
prevention setting and as adjuvant treatment after
complete HCC ablation in cirrhotic patients. In addition,
although there may be a potential hazard of stimulating
synchronous occult tumours through the inhibition of
TGF-β-induced tumour suppression (particularly with
inhibitors of TGF-β receptors), early clinical results of
TGF-β inhibition in HCC patients do not show evidence
of malignant transformation from underlying cirrhotic
livers[9, 121]. Nonetheless, in future multidisciplinary
strategies, TGF-β inhibitors should be considered with
caution after extensive liver resection, as the TGF-β
pathway plays a crucial role during liver regeneration.
In contrast, in PDAC, TGF-β overproduction
is more a consequence of tumour development, i.e.
microenvironment remodelling by tumour cells. Thus,
TGF-β levels are expected to decrease after tumour
resection and a preventive or adjuvant role of TGF-β
inhibition may be limited to the small fraction of
resectable PDAC emerging in chronic pancreatitis. In this
case, TGF-β inhibitors should be preferentially used in
the advanced PDAC setting. Moreover, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy induce TGF-β activity, possibly promoting
metastatic progression, and high levels of TGF-β are
associated with resistance to anticancer treatments[10,
127]. Then, combined TGF-β inhibition may enhance
tumour sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy[10].
TGF-β inhibition should thus be tested in association with
conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, both in advanced
PDAC and HCC.
As TGF-β inhibitors are mainly anti-invasive agents
and can display dual effects on proliferation, clinical
development of these agents raises the question of whether
they should be used as monotherapy or in combination.
Gemcitabine is a reference chemotherapy in PDAC and
can be combined with platinum salts in HCC, making it a
potential cytotoxic partner with no expected overlapping
toxicities. There is also a rationale for combination with
targeted agents such as mTOR or MEK inhibitors, with
preclinical data supporting a cooperative relationship
between the Ras-ERK and TGF-β pathways[49, 52,
128]. Furthermore, EMT can be a predictive biomarker
of response to MEK inhibitors; by attenuating the
mesenchymal phenotype of tumour cells, TGF-β inhibition
may sensitize them to MEK inhibition[129]. In addition,
TGF-β cooperates with hypoxia to induce EMT and
VEGF signalling through HIF-1α induction[10, 94, 130].
This provides a rationale in HCC for combination with
anti-angiogenic agents such as sorafenib (concomitant or
sequential treatment after progression under sorafenib)
or with hypoxia-inducing procedures such as arterial
embolization. Finally, as TGF-β creates a vicious circle
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of inflammation and immunosuppression, combination
with immunotherapies may also be an option through
the restoration of the immune response by TGF-β
inhibitors[10, 109]. For example, by restoring lymphocyte
cytotoxic activity, TGF-β inhibition may potentiate the
effects of anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1 antibodies.
In conclusion, despite being critical for development
and tumour suppression in normal cells, in cancer,
alterations of TGF-β pathway signalling do not suppress
its signalling but rather change tumour cell fate through
intrinsic (SMAD2/3-dependent and -independent
pathways rewiring) and extrinsic (microenvironment
remodelling)
mechanisms.
Microenvironment
remodelling by TGF-β, in space and time, will generate
a more hospitable environment for tumour growth and
dissemination. Understanding the mechanisms mediating
the dual role of the TGF-β signalling pathway is critical
for the development of specific and efficient TGF-βtargeted therapies in PDAC and HCC.
