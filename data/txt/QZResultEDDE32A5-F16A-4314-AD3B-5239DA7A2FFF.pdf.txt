the Growth of p16INK4A-Deﬁcient Pancreatic Cancers

Abstract
Loss-of-function mutations in p16INK4A (CDKN2A) occur in approximately 80% of sporadic pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), contributing to its early progression. Although this loss activates the cell-cycle–
dependent kinases CDK4/6, which have been considered as drug targets for many years, p16INK4A-deﬁcient PDAC
cells are inherently resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. This study searched for targeted therapies that might synergize
with CDK4/6 inhibition in this setting. We report that the IGF1R/IR inhibitor BMS-754807 cooperated with the
CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 to strongly block proliferation of p16INK4A-deﬁcient PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo.
Sensitivity to this drug combination correlated with reduced activity of the master cell growth regulator mTORC1.
Accordingly, replacing the IGF1R/IR inhibitor with the rapalog inhibitor temsirolimus broadened the sensitivity
of PDAC cells to CDK4/6 inhibition. Our results establish targeted therapy combinations with robust cytostatic
activity in p16INK4A-deﬁcient PDAC cells and possible implications for improving treatment of a broad spectrum
of human cancers characterized by p16INK4A loss. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3947–58. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (pRB) pathway is a
key negative regulator of cell proliferation and functionally
inactivated in many cancers (1). During the G1 phase of the cell
cycle, cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate pRB, allowing
E2F transcription factors to drive S-phase entry and to promote cell-cycle progression (2). The regulation of pRB is
frequently compromised in tumor cells by loss of the CDKN2A
locus (3). CDKN2A encodes p16INK4A, an inhibitor of CDK4
and CDK6, and p14ARF, an inhibitor of MDM2-mediated p53
degradation (4). Loss of p16INK4A results in hyperactive cyclin
D–CDK4/6 kinase complexes and pRB is the best-known
member of a plethora of CDK4/6 substrates (5). In normal
cells, cyclin D–CDK4/6 kinases integrate mitogenic signals.
Elevated CDK4/6 activity promotes tumor growth by counteracting tumor suppressor mechanisms, such as senescence and
apoptosis (6–8). Because the great majority of cancers with
CDKN2A loss retain intact RB1, there is considerable interest
in targeting CDK4/6 as a treatment strategy for these tumors,
and in identifying drug combinations that potentiate the
therapeutic effect.

PD-0332991 (palbociclib) is an orally active CDK4/6-speciﬁc
inhibitor, which selectively inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 with in
vitro IC50 values of 11 and 16 nmol/L, respectively (9). In cells
that express intact pRB, PD-0332991 blocks pRB phosphorylation at sites normally targeted by CDK4/6 (including serines
S807/811 and S780) and causes G1 cell-cycle arrest (9, 10). PD0332991 has been well tolerated in phase I clinical trials and is
effective in mantle cell lymphoma as well as in estrogen
receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer (10–13). By contrast,
single-agent treatment with PD-0332991 has produced only
modest responses in most other malignancies regardless of
CDKN2A mutational status.
The mechanisms of resistance to PD-0332991 in tumors
predicted to have hyperactive CDK4/6 are poorly understood.
Mutant forms of pRB that lack CDK phosphorylation sites give
a dominant arrest in tumor cell lines (14). A combination of PD0332991 and drugs that converge on the pRB pathway might
lead to more effective CDK4/6 suppression and more stable
pRB reactivation. Indeed, recent preclinical studies have
shown CDK4/6 inhibition to cooperate with therapeutics
targeting oncogenic drivers of p16INK4A-mutant cancers such
as pediatric astrocytoma and malignant melanoma (15, 16).
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth
leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and
highly resistant to existing treatments. Because CDKN2A inactivation occurs in 80% to 95% of cases and contributes to the
early progression of PDAC precursor lesions whereas RB1
remains intact, CDK4/6 is an attractive target in these tumors
(17–21). Here we sought to identify compounds showing
synergy with CDK4/6 inhibitors in PDAC. Analysis of a comprehensive screen identifying genomic markers for drug sensitivities in cancer cell lines (22) suggested that mutational
status of CDKN2A may correlate with sensitivity to inhibitors

Drug Combinations against p16INK4A-Deﬁcient Pancreatic Cancers

that selectively target the insulin-like growth factor I receptor
(IGF1R) and the related insulin receptor (IR). We found that
concurrent targeting of CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR resulted in
synergistic effects on proliferation of CDKN2A-mutant PDAC
cell lines in vitro and potent suppression of tumor growth in
vivo. pRB depletion or activation of the key IGF1R/IR downstream effector mTORC1 was sufﬁcient to render cells resistant
to the synergistic drug combination, suggesting that alterations in these pathways converge to promote the growth of
CDKN2A-deleted PDAC cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and drugs
All cell lines were provided and authenticated by The Center
of Molecular Therapeutics (Massachusetts General Hospital
Cancer Center) and cultured in RPMI medium containing 5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), except for YAPC, HPAC, HPAF-II, and
Panc1, which were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS, and MIAPaCa-2, which was grown in DMEM/F12 with 5% FBS. Cell
media were supplemented with penicillin/streptavidin and
glutamine, and cells were maintained at 37 C and 5% CO2.
BMS-754807, OSI-906, and PD-0332991 were purchased from
ChemieTek, temsirolimus, and AZD8055 were from Selleck
Chemicals. The compounds used to treat cells were dissolved
in DMSO at 10 mmol/L and stored at 80 C.
Cell viability and synergy assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2,000 to 4,000 cells/well
depending on the growth characteristic of the cell line so that
each was in growth phase at the end of the assay (60%–80%
conﬂuency). The following day, cells were treated in duplicate
with single agents and their ﬁxed-ratio combination for 72
hours over an 8-point, 128-fold concentration range, which was
centered on the single-agent concentrations that inhibited
viability by 50% (IC50). Cell viability was measured by staining
the cells for 4 hours with 100 mg/mL resazurin (Sigma) whose
conversion was detected at wavelengths of 510/595 nm using
a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). The R
software package mixlow (23) was applied to derive Loewe
synergy indexes from the sensitivities to the single agents and
their combination.
Mouse treatment study
One million YAPC cells in 100 mL PBS were injected subcutaneously into each ﬂank of 10-week-old female CB17/lcrPrkdcscid/lcrCrl mice (Charles River Laboratories). After 1 week,
tumor volumes were determined using electronic calipers to

measure the length (L) and width (W) and calculated according
to the formula (L  W2)/2. The mice were separated into four
groups matched for tumor volume (50–60 mm3), which were
randomly assigned to treatment arms. For oral administration,
BMS-754807 was dissolved in sterile polyethylene glycol 400
(PEG400)/water (4:1, v/v) and PD-0332991 was dissolved in
sterile 50 mmol/L sodium lactate (pH 4). The drugs or their
vehicles were administered by gastric gavage every other
day starting from day 8 after injection, with PD-0332991 at
75 mg/kg being fed in the morning and BMS-754807 at 15
mg/kg in the evening (minimum of 6 hours between PD0332991 and BMS-754807). Tumor volumes were assessed
twice weekly as described above. For pharmacodynamic evaluation at the study endpoint, tumor tissue was harvested 3
hours after the ﬁnal BMS-754807 dose and frozen in liquid
nitrogen or ﬁxed in 10% formalin. All mouse studies were
conducted through Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC #2005N000148)-approved animal protocols in
accordance with institutional guidelines.
Additional Materials and Methods are described in the
Supplementary Methods.

Results
CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR inhibitors synergize in CDKN2Adeleted PDAC lines
To identify targeted therapies that sensitize cancer cells to
the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991, we examined drug sensitivity data from a comprehensive cancer cell line screen (22).
As expected, sensitivity to PD-0332991 was associated with
CDKN2A loss and lack of RB1 mutations. We noted that
CDKN2A was the cancer gene whose mutational status most
frequently correlated with differential drug response (Supplementary Fig. S4 of ref. 22). The correlations with CDKN2A
status were particularly evident in PDAC cell lines where 32
drugs showed a trend toward decreased efﬁcacy in the context
of mutant CDKN2A versus wild-type CDKN2A. However, the
number of CDKN2A wild-type PDAC lines included in the
screen was small (N ¼ 3), thus any hypothesis coming from
this data needed to be veriﬁed experimentally. We reasoned
that if the difference in drug sensitivity was indeed associated
with inactivation of CDKN2A then it should be possible to
recapitulate this effect by combining these drugs with PD0332991 in CDKN2A-mutant PDAC cells, because this would
mimic functional p16INK4A (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The drugs with decreased sensitivities in CDKN2A-mutant
PDAC cells included three different small molecule IGF1R/IR
kinase inhibitors (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S2). BMS-

Drug Combinations against p16INK4A-Deﬁcient Pancreatic Cancers

Figure 3. Concurrent treatment with
PD-0332991 and BMS-754807 is
synergistic in vivo. A, YAPC
xenografts were treated with 15
mg/kg BMS-754807 (BMS; N ¼ 5),
75 mg/kg PD-0332991 (PD; N ¼ 6),
their combination (BMS/PD; N ¼ 5),
or vehicle (N ¼ 5) on days 8, 10, 12,
14, 17, 19, and 21 after
subcutaneous tumor implant and
tumor volumes (mean  SEM) were
measured every 3 days from day 7.
P values were calculated by 2tailed t test for BMS/PD versus the
other groups ( , P < 0.05) and the
single-agent treatments versus the
vehicle group (not signiﬁcant). B,
tumors were lysed following
completion of the treatment study
and analyzed by Western blotting
with the indicated antibodies; a
representative of at least two
independent experiments is
shown.

754807, with in vitro IC50 value of less than 2 nmol/L for IGF1R/
IR, is the most potent of these compounds (24). IGF1R and IR
are receptor protein tyrosine kinases that upon ligand binding
phosphorylate IR substrate (IRS) proteins, which activate the
PI3K–AKT–mTOR as well as the RAS-MAPK signaling axes
(25), key effectors in oncogenic KRAS-driven PDAC development (26).
To test whether targeting of CDK4/6 sensitizes PDAC cells to
IGF1R/IR inhibitors, we used a Loewe synergy assay, which
allows for testing of drug combinations in ﬁxed ratios (23).
PDAC cells were treated with PD-0332991, BMS-754807, and
their combination over an 8-point, 128-fold concentration
range for 72 hours, and viability was measured with resazurin.
The combination of PD-0332991 and BMS-754807 reduced
viability of the PDAC cell line MIA-PaCa-2 signiﬁcantly at
doses that had comparatively minor effects in the single-agent
treatments (Fig. 1A). The combination of PD-0332991 with a
second IGF1R/IR inhibitor (OSI-906) resulted in similar sensitivities (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the effects of the drug
combination are because of on-target IGF1R/IR inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. S3). To conﬁrm that loss of CDK4/6
activity sensitizes the cells to IGF1R/IR inhibitors, we treated
MIA-PaCa-2 cells with BMS-754807 after CDK4, CDK6, or
CDK4 and CDK6 had been depleted with siRNAs (Fig. 1C). Of
note, depletion of CDK4 and CDK6 decreased MIA-PaCa-2
viability by 60%, indicating that these p16INK4A-mutant cells
rely on CDK4/6 for growth. BMS-754807 signiﬁcantly reduced
viability of cells treated with siRNAs targeting CDK4 or CDK4

and CDK6, but did not affect cells treated with control siRNA or
CDK6 siRNA. These data suggest that targeting of CDK4/6
sensitizes PDAC cells to IGF1R/IR inhibition and thus cooperates to reduce PDAC cell viability.
Next we carried out a systematic assessment of drug synergy
across a panel of PDAC cell lines. Loewe synergy indexes were
derived from the sensitivities to the single agents and their
combination using the R software package mixlow (23) in 14
PDAC cell lines, including lines with homozygous CDKN2A
deletion, CDKN2A point mutations, and wild-type CDKN2A
(Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S4). BMS-754807 (15–500
nmol/L) and PD-0332991 (0.15–5.0 mmol/L) synergized significantly to reduce viability up to 70% to 80% in the cell lines MIAPaCa-2, PSN1, HuP-T3, and YAPC and showed synergy limited
to a part of the effect range in the HPAC and AsPC-1 lines (Fig.
1E). No synergy was observed at high doses (PD-0332991 > 10
mmol/L), most likely because of off-target drug effects.
All cell lines susceptible to the drug synergism harbor
deletions that span the CDKN2A locus and frequently affect
adjacent genes (Sanger COSMIC Cell Line Project). To assess
the potential role of these codeleted genes, the drug synergy
status of the cell lines was compared with their CDKN2A,
MTAP, and CDKN2B mRNA expression levels (Broad-Novartis
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia). Although CDKN2A expression
is lost in all four susceptible lines (Fig. 1F), PSN1 cells have
detectable CDKN2B mRNA and YAPC express MTAP (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that CDKN2A loss is the primary
requirement for the drug synergy. Of note, CDKN2A loss is not

sufﬁcient to generate sensitivity to the drug combination.
Because p16INK4A is frequently lost by means other than genetic
deletion, we used siRNA against CDK4/6 to verify that the
proliferation of 2 sensitive lines depends on CDK4/6, whereas
the proliferation of 2 CDKN2A wild-type lines does not (Fig. 1G).
In conclusion, we have identiﬁed a drug combination that
synergistically inhibits viability in more than half (4/7) of the
CDKN2A-deleted PDAC cell lines tested.
Concurrent inhibition of CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR
enhances G1 arrest and senescence
Cyclin D–CDK4/6 kinase complexes drive G1–S cell-cycle
progression. We performed cell-cycle analysis to examine how
the CDK4/6 inhibitor affects viability when combined with
IGF1R/IR inhibitor. Treatment of MIA-PaCa-2 cells with PD0332991 for 24 hours resulted in an increased G1–G0 population
(from 41% to 61%) and reductions in the proportion of cells in
S-phase (45% to 30%) and G2–M (14% to 8%; Fig. 2A). In
combination with BMS-754807, G1–G0 arrest was markedly
augmented (15% S, 77% G1–G0, and 7% G2–M), whereas
BMS-754807 alone did not signiﬁcantly affect cell-cycle distribution (Fig. 2A). To determine the timing of this enhanced
G1–G0 arrest, we investigated shorter treatment durations. PD0332991 reduced the S-phase population more potently to 13%
and 10% after 8 and 16 hours, respectively (Fig. 2B). BMS-754807
addition decreased this fraction further to 4% at 16 hours, but
had no added effect at 8 hours. These data suggest that IGF1R/IR
inhibition synergizes with CDK4/6 inhibition by enhancing the
PD-0332991 induced G1–G0 arrest starting from 16 hours after
addition of the drugs and by maintaining the G1–S block more
efﬁciently. The enhanced G1–G0 arrest at 24 hours was conﬁrmed for the sensitive PSN1, HuP-T3, and YAPC lines (Fig. 2C).
Prolonged G1–G0 arrest can lead to senescence and PD0332991 has previously been shown to cause senescence in
solid tumors (6). Correspondingly, staining for senescenceassociated b-galactosidase (SA-b-gal; ref. 27) revealed that
combination treatment induced high levels of senescence
compared with the single agents (combination treatment
61% SA-b-gal positive cells vs. BMS-754807 13% and PD0332991 42%; Fig. 2D). Comparable results were obtained for
HuP-T3 and YAPC cells, in which the drug combination
induced a signiﬁcant increase of SA-b-gal. These ﬁndings were
further corroborated by counting population doublings of
HuP-T3 and YAPC cells cultured in the presence of the inhibitors and passaged every 4 days. Combination treatment
prevented population doubling in HuP-T3 cells and strongly
slowed it in YAPC cells treated with half the drug doses
compared with the HuP-T3 experiments, consistent with
induction of a cytostatic senescence response, whereas
BMS-754807 had no signiﬁcant effect on cell proliferation and
PD-0332991 showed an intermediate effect (Fig. 2E).
Combined CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR inhibition is
synergistic in vivo
We evaluated whether combined CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR
inhibition is synergistic in vivo and could be a potential
therapeutic approach against PDAC. Xenograft tumors were
generated with YAPC cells, which are sensitive to the drug

3952

combination in vitro and form tumors within a week after
subcutaneous injection into SCID mice. Once tumors reached
50 mm3 in volume, the mice were grouped and treatment was
initiated with submaximal tolerated doses of each inhibitor.
Administration of the single agents had no signiﬁcant effect on
the tumor volume, paralleling the in vitro results (Fig. 3A). In
contrast, the combination therapy slowed tumor growth
approximately 2.5-fold and signiﬁcantly reduced tumor burden
as compared with both the vehicle and the monotherapy
cohorts (Fig. 3A), suggesting that concurrent targeting of
CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR is synergistic in vivo. This efﬁcacy was
achieved in the absence of any apparent adverse effects.
Consistent with the in vitro ﬁndings, we observed increased
staining for the senescence marker trimethylated lysine 9
histone H3 in PD-0332991 treated tumors, which was further
enhanced by the drug combination (Supplementary Fig. S6).
To conﬁrm that the drugs inhibited their respective targets
in vivo, we analyzed the tumors at the study endpoint for
CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR signaling. BMS-754807 alone or in
combination with PD-0332991 reduced tyrosine autophosphorylation of IGF1R/IR as well as phosphorylation of the
IGF1R/IR downstream effector AKT (Fig. 3B). Single-agent PD0332991 did not affect these phosphorylation events. To read
out the activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) downstream of IGF1R/IR-AKT, we detected S6K1
phosphorylation at the mTORC1 site T389. Although BMS754807 alone had only a slight effect, the drug combination
abrogated S6K1 phosphorylation, suggesting that IGF1R/IRAKT inhibition only translated to effective mTORC1 suppression in the presence of the CDK4/6 inhibitor, which did not
decrease S6K1 activation by itself. To evaluate CDK4/6 activity
in the tumors, we detected pRB phosphorylation at the CDK4/6
sites S807/811. The drug combination notably reduced phospho-pRB levels, whereas either single-agent treatment led to a
minimal decrease in pRB phosphorylation. In accordance with
a previous study noting that PD-0332991 stabilizes cyclin D1
(28), we observed elevated cyclin D1 levels in tumors that had
been treated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor alone or in combination, indicating that PD-0332991 targeted CDK4/6 in both
regimes. In vitro experiments conﬁrmed that BMS-754807
enhances PD-0332291–mediated inhibition of pRB phosphorylation in YAPC cells even under conditions optimal for drug
delivery (Supplementary Fig. S7). Together, these data indicate
that the single agents affected their respective targets, but did
not suppress tumor growth. In contrast, the drug combination
elicited a tumorstatic response corresponding with enhanced
S6K1 inhibition and pRB reactivation.
The drug combination speciﬁcally reduces S6K1
phosphorylation
To elucidate the mechanistic basis for the drug synergy,
we investigated the phosphorylation of the CDK4/6 substrate
pRB and of IGF1R/IR effectors after addition of BMS-754807,
PD-0332991, and their combination. PSN1 cells were treated
with PD-0332991, which abrogated pRB phosphorylation 16
hours after drug addition (Fig. 4A). This effect was not present
at time points as early as 2 hours, most likely because of the fact
that asynchronously cycling cell populations were used. CDK4/

antibodies.

6 inhibition was combined with low doses of BMS-754807 that
dampened AKT activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
4A). As observed in the xenograft tumors, BMS-754807–mediated inhibition of S6K1 T389 phosphorylation was enhanced by
PD-0332991 (Fig. 4A). Thus, these compounds cooperate to
inactivate mTORC1 in PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo.
To address whether this effect may be responsible for the
drug synergy, we compared the effects on S6K1 phosphorylation
in two lines that displayed the synergy with two lines that did
not show the synergistic effects. Although concurrent treatment with BMS-754807 and PD-0332991 signiﬁcantly reduced
S6K1 phosphorylation in the sensitive MIA-PaCa-2 and HuP-T3
cell lines (Fig. 4B), it had no effect in PANC-03-27 or CFPAC-1
cells, in which the inhibitors do not synergize. The inhibitors
did not affect ERK1/2 activity, suggesting that the signaling
alterations were speciﬁc to the PI3K-mTOR pathway (Fig. 4B).
Cyclin D1 or CDK4/6 depletion sensitizes PDAC cells to
S6K1 inhibition
The cooperation of CDK4/6 inhibitor with IGF1R/IR targeting on the level of mTORC1 raised the question whether this

effect of PD-0332991 was through inhibition of CDK4/6 or offtarget. To distinguish between these possibilities, cyclin D1 or
CDK4/6 were depleted with siRNA followed by BMS-754807
treatment for 2 hours. Cyclin D1 knockdown sensitized MIAPaCa-2 and YAPC cells to BMS-754807–mediated inhibition of
S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Identical results were obtained
in YAPC cells after CDK4/6 depletion. CDK4/6 knockdown in
MIA-PaCa-2 cells lead to increased phospho-S6K1 that was
strongly reduced by BMS-754807, which had no effect on
control siRNA–transfected cells (Fig. 5B). These ﬁndings indicate that the PD-0332991–mediated sensitization to mTORC1
inhibition is speciﬁc and could thus be shared by other CDK4/6
inhibitors.
CDK4/6 and mTOR inhibitors synergize in CDKN2Adeleted PDAC lines
The observed effect on phosphorylation of S6K1, a primary
substrate of mTORC1, raised the question whether mTORC1
inhibition would sufﬁce to synergize with CDK4/6 inhibition.
Indeed, PD-0332991 synergized with temsirolimus, an allosteric mTOR inhibitor that speciﬁcally targets mTORC1, to reduce

catalytic mTOR inhibitors would have been expected to be
additive, rather than synergistic.

viability of not only the PDAC lines sensitive to BMS-754807/
PD-0332991, but also the additional lines PANC-03-27, BxPC-3,
and PANC-10-05 (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S8). IGF1R/IR
signaling may not be required for mTORC1 activity in these
lines. Remarkably, combined CDK4/6 and mTORC1 inhibition
synergized, at least partially, in all of the CDKN2A-deleted
PDAC lines tested (Fig. 6B).
Catalytic mTOR kinase inhibitors, such as AZD8055, have
recently been developed in order to target both mTOR complexes and abolish mTORC1 activities more effectively than
rapalogs. AZD8055, which is two orders of magnitude more
potent than temsirolimus in HuP-T3 cells, synergized with PD0332991 (Fig. 6C), indicating that the effects of these compounds can be further enhanced by concurrent CDK4/6 inhibition. This result excludes any catalytic off-target effects of

TSC2 or pRB depletion restores growth in the presence of
CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR inhibitors
To evaluate the role of mTORC1 in mediating the synergistic
drug effects, we performed sensitivity assays with cells after
knockdown of tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2). TSC2 is an integral
part of the tuberous sclerosis complex and incorporates signaling inputs from AKT, RSK, nutrient, and stress signaling
to restrain mTORC1 activity. TSC2 depletion in three different
cell lines (PSN1, MIA-PaCa-2, and HuP-T3) restored cell
proliferation in the presence of PD-0332991 and BMS754807/PD-0332991 (Fig. 7A), suggesting that mTORC1 activation is sufﬁcient to render cells resistant to the CDK4/6
inhibitor and the combination therapy. This effect was speciﬁc
to the combination of CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR inhibitors, as
TSC2 depletion did not completely prevent growth inhibition
in the presence of PD-0332991 and temsirolimus, which blocks
mTORC1 downstream of TSC2 (Fig. 7A).
The best-established cyclin D–CDK4/6 substrates are the
pRB family members. Because pRB fulﬁlls a unique role among
the pocket proteins in mediating oncogene-induced senescence, we tested whether loss of pRB would render cells
insensitive to the synergistic drug combination. We made
stable MIA-PaCa-2 and HuP-T3 lines, in which pRB was
depleted with two different shRNAs, and determined their
sensitivities to BMS-754807, PD-0332991, and their combination. The pRB-depleted cell pools were less sensitive to either
drug alone as well as to the drug combination (Fig. 7B), with the
shRNA construct that gave the stronger reduction in pRB levels
(shRB1-2) conferring a higher degree of resistance. These data
suggest that both IGF1R/IR and CDK4/6 inhibitors engage the
pRB tumor suppressor pathway and that pRB loss can alleviate
the synergistic effects of the drug combination.

Discussion
Here we identify inherent resistance of CDKN2A-mutant
PDAC cells to CDK4/6 inhibitor and describe drug combinations that efﬁciently reactivate the pRB tumor suppressor
pathway to trigger cell-cycle arrest and senescence. CDKN2A
loss is frequent in PDAC and contributes to PDAC progression
by bypassing oncogenic RAS-induced senescence (29–31).
Although several CDKN2A-mutant PDAC cell lines indeed
depend on CDK4/6, only 1 of 13 cell lines with CDKN2A
mutations is sensitive to PD-0332991 (AsPC-1 IC50 0.25
mmol/L; Supplementary Table S1). Our data suggest that
CDKN2A-deleted PDAC cells are intrinsically resistant to
CDK4/6 inhibition alone, because PD-0332991 failed to induce
sustained growth arrest and senescence at concentrations that
initially block CDK4/6 activity as evidenced by decreased pRB
phosphorylation. This inherent resistance to PD-0332991 is
likely because of elevated PI3K-mTOR activity. KRAS-driven
PDAC formation and maintenance has been demonstrated to
depend on active PI3K signaling (26) that suppresses oncogenic RAS-induced senescence in pancreatic cancer (30). The
results described here show that targeting of IGF1R/IR, which

inhibition alone. CDK4/6 has long been known for its role to
promote growth in model organisms and its constitutive
activation following p16INK4A loss may provide growth signals
in the absence of IGF1R/IR signaling. Although the IGF1R/IR

nanomolar doses, it failed to efﬁciently inhibit the mTORC1
substrate S6K1 at these concentrations and impacted viability
only at doses that were 2 orders of magnitude higher. Persistent
activation of mTOR has recently been described to correlate
with resistance of breast cancers to PI3K inhibitor (33) as well
as with resistance of melanoma to RAF or MEK inhibitor (34).
Similarly, here we found that the response to concurrent
CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR inhibition correlated well with
decreased mTORC1 activity. PD-0332991–mediated sensitization to mTORC1 inhibition could be recapitulated with siRNA
against either cyclin D1 or CDK4/6, suggesting that other
CDK4/6 inhibitors could share this activity. Overexpressed
cyclin D has been previously shown to bind the mTORC1
negative regulator TSC2 (35), providing evidence of a direct
physical connection between cyclin D1–CDK4/6 and regulation of mTORC1. To date, we have been unable to conﬁrm this
interaction between the endogenous proteins. Our results do,
however, suggest that TSC2 likely plays a critical role in this
synergistic drug response, as its depletion rendered cells
resistant to the combination of CDK4/6 and IGF1R/IR inhibitors. Furthermore, PD-0332991 synergized with the rapalog
temsirolimus. This drug combination may be more easily

3956

translatable, because it expanded the number of sensitive
CDKN2A-mutant lines and rapalogs have been well tolerated
in clinical settings.
The synergistic effects seen by combining PD-0332991 with
other treatments apply to other cancer types. A recent drug
synergy screen and network modeling study suggested that
hyperactive CDK4 and IGF1R signaling also cooperate in
liposarcoma (36). Targeting additional cancer types may
require the identiﬁcation of context-speciﬁc oncogenic drivers
that cooperate with CDK4/6 deregulation (37). Apart from the
clinical beneﬁt of a combination of PD-0332991 and letrozole
seen in ER-positive breast cancer, several preclinical studies
have shown PD-0332991 to be effective in combination with
drugs targeting mitogenic drivers in pediatric astrocytoma,
melanoma, and prostate cancer (15, 16, 28). In conclusion, our
work suggests that CDKN2A loss in PDAC can be exploited by
concurrent targeting of CDK4/6 and the IGF1R/IR-mTOR axis
in order to efﬁciently reactivate pRB tumor suppressor functions and suppress growth.
