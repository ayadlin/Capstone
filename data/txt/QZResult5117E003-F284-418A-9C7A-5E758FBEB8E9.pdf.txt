Abstract

Introduction

Transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B) induces apoptosis
in hepatocytes, being considered a liver tumor suppressor.
However, many human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells
escape from its proapoptotic effects, gaining response to
this cytokine in terms of malignancy. We have recently
reported that the apoptosis induced by TGF-B in hepatocytes requires up-regulation of the NADPH oxidase NOX4,
which mediates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
TGF-B–induced NOX4 expression is inhibited by antiapoptotic signals, such as the phosphatydilinositol-3-phosphate
kinase or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. The
aim of the present work was to analyze whether resistance
to TGF-B–induced apoptosis in HCC cells is related to the
impairment of NOX4 up-regulation due to overactivation
of survival signals. Results indicate that inhibition of the
MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway in HepG2 cells,
which are refractory to the proapoptotic effects of TGF-B,
sensitizes them to cell death through a mitochondrialdependent mechanism, coincident with increased levels of
BIM and BMF, decreased levels of BCL-XL and MCL1, and
BAX/BAK activation. Regulation of BMF, BCL-XL, and MCL1
occurs at the mRNA level, whereas BIM regulation occurs
post-transcriptionally. ROS production and glutathione
depletion are only observed in cells treated with TGF-B
and PD98059, which correlates with NOX4 up-regulation.
Targeting knockdown of NOX4 impairs ROS increase and all
the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic features by a mechanism that is upstream from the regulation of BIM, BMF,
BCL-XL, and MCL1 levels. In conclusion, overactivation of
the MEK/ERK pathway in liver tumor cells confers resistance to TGF-B–induced cell death through impairing NOX4
up-regulation, which is required for an efficient mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7595–602]

The transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) family plays
physiologic roles during embryonic development, as well as in
the control of tissue homeostasis in the adult (1). TGF-h1 is an
important regulatory suppressor factor in hepatocytes, where it
early inhibits proliferation (2) and induces cell death (3). However,
cells that survive to its apoptotic effect (4, 5) later induce
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process that mediates cell
migration and survival (1, 6). Interestingly, liver tumors expressing
late TGF-h–responsive genes (antiapoptotic and metastatic)
display a higher invasive phenotype and increased tumor
recurrence when compared with those that show an early TGF-h
signature (suppressor genes; ref. 7). In this same line of evidence,
blocking TGF-h up-regulates E-cadherin and reduces migration
and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (8). Indeed,
any advance in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms
that allow liver cancer cells to escape from TGF-h–induced
apoptosis might help in future designs of targeted therapies for
human HCC.
TGF-h–mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes requires the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which precedes the loss of
mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytochrome c release,
and caspase activation (9, 10). We have recently described that
TGF-h up-regulates the Rac-independent NADPH oxidase NOX4 in
both rat and human hepatocytes, which correlates with its proapoptotic activity (11). Regulation of NOX4 occurs at the transcriptional level and is counteracted by intracellular survival signals,
such as the phosphatydilinositol-3-phosphate kinase (PI3K) and
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK pathways. In human
HCC cell lines, NOX4 up-regulation by TGF-h is only observed in
cells that are sensitive to its cytotoxic effect, such as Hep3B cells,
but not in cells that are refractory to its proapoptotic effect, such as
HepG2 cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted knockdown of
NOX4 in both rat hepatocytes and human Hep3B cells impairs
TGF-h–induced apoptosis (11).
According to this, the aim of the present work was to analyze
whether resistance to TGF-h–induced apoptosis in HCC cells
might be due to impairment of the capacity of TGF-h to upregulate NOX4 and whether or not this impairment might be
due to the overactivation of survival signals that takes place in liver
tumor cells.

Cell Cultures, cultured in MEM or DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 37jC,
5% CO2. For experiments, cells at 70% confluence were serum-starved
during 8 to 12 h before treatments. Treatments were as follows: PD98059
(50 Amol/L), U0126 (10 Amol/L), or PD0325901 (2 Amol/L) was added
30 min before TGF-h (2 ng/mL); glutathione-ethyl-ester (GEE, 2 mmol/L)
or diphenyleneiodonium (10 Amol/L) was added 30 min before PD98059.
Reagents were from Calbiochem, Cayman Chemicals, or Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell viability analysis. Cells were seeded in 96-well plate. Multitox-Fluor
Multiplex Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega) reagents were added after
treatments as indicated by manufacturer’s protocol. Fluorescence was
measured in a Microplate Fluorescence Reader Fluostar Optima. Viability
was calculated as a ratio of live/death cells fluorescence and expressed as

of cells was estimated by flow cytometry DNA analysis, as described
previously (6).
Measurement of intracellular redox state. The oxidation-sensitive
fluorescent probes 2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA;
from Invitrogen) and Monochlorobimane ( from Sigma) were used to
analyze the total intracellular content of ROS and reduced glutathione
(GSH), respectively (12). Fluorescence was measured in a Microplate
Fluorescence Reader Fluostar Optima and expressed as percentage to

analyze the lysosomal permeabilization and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, respectively. Cells were detached by trypsinization, the
fluorescent probes were loaded into the cells by incubation in HBSS without
red phenol at a final concentration of 50 nmol/L for 30 min at 37jC and
transferred in duplicate into a 96-well plate. Fluorescence was measured in
a Microplate Fluorescence Reader Fluostar Optima (exc. 510, em. 590) and
expressed as percentage of control after correction with protein content.
Determination of the percentage of cells containing active BAX or
BAK. Cells were plated on gelatin-coated glass coverslips. The monolayer
was washed with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for
30 min at room temperature and incubated for 2 min with 0.1% Triton
X-100. Primary antibodies, anti-Bax antibody 6A7 clone and anti-Bak G317-2
clone (BD Pharmingen; 1:50), were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin and
incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After several washes with PBS, the
samples were incubated with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:200 for Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated antirabbit) for 1 h at room
temperature and embedded in Vectashield with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). Cells were visualized in an Olympus
BX-60 microscope with the appropriate filters. Blue signal represents the
nuclear DNA staining with DAPI. Representative images were taken with a
Spot 4.3 digital camera and softwared and edited in Adobe Photoshop.
Results are shown as percentage of positive cells relative to cell number.
Analysis of gene expression. RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) was used for
total RNA isolation. Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out with random
primers using 1 Ag of total RNA from each sample for complementary DNA
synthesis. Semiquantitative PCR reactions were performed using human
specific primers whose sequence is detailed in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. PCR products were obtained after 30 to 35 cycles of amplification
at annealing temperatures of 57 to 62jC and analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel
electrophoresis. Expression of albumin was analyzed as a loading control.
The RT channel contained RNA that had not been treated with the RT
mixture and is shown as a specificity control. When RNA was analyzed

MEK/ERK Impairs TGF-b–Induced Apoptosis in Tumor Cells
by reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
(RT-MLPA), the SALSA MLPA KIT R011 Apoptosis mRNA from MRCHolland (Amsterdam) for the simultaneous detection of 38 mRNA
molecules was used and relative expression of each gene was normalized
by h-2-microglobulin expression (13).
Western blot analysis. Total protein extracts were obtained using
a lysis buffer containing 30 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L EDTA,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycolate, 0.1% SDS,
and 10% glycerol. Pellets were incubated during 1 h in lysis buffer at
4jC and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm during 10 min at 4jC. Western blot
procedure was carried out as described previously (5). The antibodies used
are detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Targeting knockdown assays. For transient siRNA transfection, cells at
70% confluence were transfected, during 8 h, using TransIT-siQuest (Mirus)
at 1:300 dilution in complete medium (according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation). Final siRNA concentration was 25 nmol/L in NOX4
knockdown and 200 nmol/L, each one, in ERK1+ERK2 knockdown. After
16 h of incubation in complete medium, cells were trypsinized and seeded
for experiments. Oligos were obtained from Sigma-Genosys. The oligo
sequences were as follows:
Unsilencing: 5¶GUAAGACACGACUUAUCGC 3¶.
NOX4: 5¶GCCUCUACAUAUGCAAUAA 3¶.
ERK1: 5¶UUGCGCACGUGGUCAUAGG 3¶.
ERK2: 5¶GUACAGGACCUCAUGGAAA 3¶.
The unsilencing siRNA used was selected from previous works (14). Specific
oligos with maximal knockdown efficiency were selected among three

different sequences for each gene evaluated by the Dharmacon design
algorithm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.-Darmachon RNAi Technologies).

Results
Inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway sensitizes HepG2
cells to TGF-B–induced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.
In agreement with previous results (11), HepG2 cells did not
respond to TGF-h in terms of cell death (Supplementary Fig. S1A),
although these cells responded to TGF-h inducing SMAD2
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and mitogen-induced
growth inhibition (results not shown). Among different pharmacologic kinase inhibitors, we could observe that a specific MEK
inhibitor, PD98059, was able to sensitize HepG2 cells to TGF-h–
induced loss of cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Western blot
experiments revealed that HepG2 cells, cultured in the absence of
FBS, showed constitutive phosphorylation of ERK (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). This result is in agreement with previous reports
indicating that HepG2 cells show alterations in the RAS pathway,
which mediates overactivation of the p42/p44 MAPK (15). Other
HCC cell lines that are sensitive to TGF-h–induced cell death, such
as PLC/PRF-5 and Hep3B, showed much lower levels of phosphorylated ERKs activation. A correlation between ERK activation and resistance to cell death was observed (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Furthermore, hyperactivation of ERKs by phorbol esters
in a TGF-h–sensitive cell line (Hep3B) blocked TGF-h–induced

caspase-3 activation and apoptosis (results not shown). Interestingly, inhibition with PD98059 enhanced the cytotoxic response
to TGF-h in both PLC/PRF-5 and Hep3B cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2B and C). This result might be explained by the fact that
TGF-h also induces antiapoptotic signals in hepatoma cells (5).
Indeed, inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway could enhance
TGF-h–induced death in different HCC cells, regardless of their
genetic background.
We could not observe significant differences either in SMAD2
phosphorylation or in the expression levels of different SMADs
(included the inhibitory SMAD6 and SMAD7) and TGF-h receptors
I and II when the MEK/ERK pathway was inhibited in HepG2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). This result suggested that
sensitization of cells to TGF-h–induced cell death might occur
downstream from receptors/SMADs activation.
Exploring the potential mechanism of cell death induced by the
combined treatment of TGF-h + PD98059 in HepG2 cells, we found
a significant increase in caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation,
analyzed as the percentage of cells with a DNA content lower than
2C (Fig. 1A and B), characteristic of an apoptotic process. All these
events were coincident with loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the lysosomal membrane integrity, analyzed
with specific fluorescent probes (Fig. 1C ), indicating that
these organelles might play a role in the mechanism of cell
death. Analysis of caspase-3 in other HCC cells confirmed that
MEK inhibition was enhancing TGF-h–induced apoptosis

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

(Supplementary Fig. S2D). Levels of p53 did not significantly
change by cell treatment with TGF-h, neither with PD98059 or the
combined treatment, excluding that MEK inhibition might affect to
the regulation of TGF-h on this pathway (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
PD98059 is a specific MEK inhibitor. However, side effects could
not be excluded. Therefore, we performed controls with other
MEK inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S4) and with cells where ERK1
and ERK2 expression was down-regulated with specific siRNAs
(Fig. 1D). In all cases ERK inhibition sensitized HepG2 cells to
TGF-h–induced loss in viability and activation of caspase-3, as a
key regulator of apoptosis.
We next decided to focus on the molecular mechanism that
might explain at which level ERK pathway is blocking TGF-h–
induced apoptosis. Changes in the expression gene profile of
apoptotic regulators, by using RT-MLPA, is shown in Fig. 2A.
Transcript and protein levels of the BH3-only gene BMF were
significantly enhanced with the combined treatment of TGF-h +
PD98059. TGF-h alone up-regulated BCL-XL and MCL1, both
antiapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family. However, a significant
decrease in the expression of these genes was observed when the
MEK/ERK inhibitor was present, which correlated with lower
protein levels (Fig. 2A). Although we could not find variations in
the expression of BIM at the mRNA levels, we found an increase in
its protein levels when MEK/ERK was inhibited, effect that was
significantly enhanced in the presence of TGF-h. In summary, the
combined treatment of TGF-h and PD98059 produced an increase

in the levels of BIM and BMF and a decrease in BCL-XL and MCL1.
This expression pattern correlated with a significant enhancement
in the percentage of cells showing the active conformational form
of BAX or BAK (Fig. 2B).
Sustained oxidative stress and significant induction of the
NADPH oxidase NOX4 in TGF-B–treated HepG2 cells are
observed when the MEK/ERK pathway is inhibited. In HepG2
cells, TGF-h alone was unable to induce an increase in ROS
production, as analyzed with the H2-DCFDA fluorescent probe.
The inhibition of MEK/ERK pathway induced a transient, although
significant, increase in the intracellular ROS content, but it was the
combined treatment of TGF-h and PD98059 that produced a
higher and sustained intracellular ROS increase at all the examined
times (Fig. 3A). ROS increase correlated with depletion of GSH
content, which was only observed in TGF-h + PD98059–treated
cells (Fig. 3B). Preincubation of cells with a membrane-permeable
form of GSH (GEE) partially blocked the apoptotic events (Fig. 3C).
We next wondered whether MEK/ERK inhibition might confer
to HepG2 cells the capacity to respond to TGF-h in terms of
NOX4 up-regulation. Results indicated that TGF-h only increased
NOX4 transcript levels in HepG2 cells when MEK/ERK were
inhibited, which was coincident with the maximum expression of
the NOX4 coactivator p22-PHOX (Fig. 3D, left). Interestingly,
at the protein level, we might observe a slight increase in NOX4
in cells treated only with PD98059, but the highest levels were
always observed with the combined treatment of TGF-h and
PD98059 (Fig. 3D, right). It has been recently suggested that

ERK activation is required for the induction of the antioxidant
gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by TGF-h (16). The analysis of the
levels of HO-1 revealed that TGF-h induced its expression in
HepG2 cells and MEK inhibition attenuated this response
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Indeed, MEK inhibition sensitizes cells
to respond to TGF-h up-regulating NOX4 and impairs the
up-regulation of the antioxidant gene HO-1. Other antioxidant
proteins, such as catalase, Mn-superoxide dismutase, or the gglutamylcisteine synthetase, did not show significant changes in
their levels (results not shown).
Role of NOX4 in cell death induced by the combined
treatment of TGF-B and the MEK/ERK inhibitor. We
next decided to target knockdown NOX4 in cells by using a
siRNA approach to specifically analyze its effect on all the cell
death features. NOX4 knockdown (Fig. 4A) decreased ROS
production (Fig. 4B), blocked disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Fig. 4C, left), and significantly attenuated
caspase-3 activation and the loss in cell viability induced by
TGF-h + PD98059 (Fig. 4D). However, NOX4 knockdown did not
attenuate the loss in lysosomal membrane integrity (Fig. 4C, right),
which suggested that NOX4 was only affecting the mitochondrialmediated mechanism of cell death. In this same line of evidence,
NOX4 knockdown attenuated TGF-h + PD98059 regulation of
BMF, BCL-XL, and MCL1 at the mRNA (Fig. 5A) and protein
(results not shown) levels, and BIM at the protein level (Fig. 5B).
Correlating with these results, NOX4 knockdown diminished the
percentage of cells showing active BAX or BAK (Fig. 5C), suggesting

that NOX4 is required for TGF-h–induced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis upstream from the regulation of BCL-2 family
expression. In this same line of evidence, pretreatment of cells with
a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium, alone or with
GEE, completely blocked increase in ROS, caspase-3 activation, and
regulation of the BCL-2 family genes after TGF-h + PD98059
treatment (Fig. 6).
A careful analysis of the attenuation of cell death in NOX4
targeted knockdown cells (Fig. 4D) revealed that a slight loss in cell
viability continued being observed in response to TGF-h +
PD98059. For this, we decided to explore whether or not the
lysosomal permeabilization, which seemed to be NOX4 independent, might play a role in the TGF-h + PD98059–induced cell death.
Among different protease inhibitors, we could only observe a slight,
but significant, protecting effect on cell death with the cathepsin B
inhibitor Ca-074 (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results indicate
that a cathepsin B–mediated pathway might contribute to TGF-h +
PD98059–induced cell death through a parallel pathway that is
NOX4 independent.

Discussion
A relevant number of molecular mechanisms altered in HCC
initiation and progression are compromising the balance between
survival and apoptosis in the preneoplastic hepatocytes. Some

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

physiologic proapoptotic molecules are down-regulated or inactivated in HCC, but the balance between death and survival is mainly
broken due to overactivation of antiapoptotic signals (17, 18).
Therefore, liver cancer cells might show stronger requirements of
these intracellular pathways to survive. Alteration of RAS pathway
is frequently observed in HCC, mainly due to RAS mutations and/
or genetic or epigenetic silencing of inhibitors of the RAS network
(19, 20), and it might confer proliferative and antiapoptotic
properties to neoplastic liver cells (20). Indeed, several advances
in the recent years have focused increasing attention on the role of
the RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in promoting cell survival (21).
Disruption of the TGF-h suppressor arm occurs in advanced
stages of HCC (7). Although some perturbations at receptor or
SMAD levels have been proposed (22, 23), molecular mechanisms
are not completely understood. Results presented in this manuscript indicate that overactivation of the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway
in liver tumor cells might confer them resistance to the apoptotic
effects of TGF-h, which is highly expressed during liver tumor
progression (24). We propose that the crosstalk between ERKs and
TGF-h signaling might be located on a key modulator of ROS
production and intracellular oxidative stress: the NADPH oxidase
NOX4, previously suggested as necessary for TGF-h–induced
apoptosis in hepatocytes (11). Up-regulation of NOX4, ROS
production, and oxidative stress do not occur except that MEK/
ERK pathway is inhibited in HepG2 cells, which constitutively show

ERKs phosphorylation. NOX4 regulation by TGF-h in rat hepatocytes occurs at the transcriptional level, and it is impaired by the
PI3K and MEK/ERK pathways (11). Our results confirm that a
similar response must exist in humans and suggest that overactivation of survival signals in HCC cells might be counteracting
TGF-h–induced cell death through attenuating NOX4 up-regulation. Interestingly, ERK activation might also contribute to the
up-regulation of antioxidant genes by TGF-h, such as HO-1 (16).
Here we describe for the first time that expression of NOX4 is
required for an efficient mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis by
TGF-h. NOX4 is required, at least, for up-regulation of two
proapoptotic BH3-only genes: BMF and BIM. It was previously
reported that TGF-h transcriptionally regulates the expression of
BMF through a ROS-dependent mechanism (25). Here we suggest
that the ROS producing system involved in this process is
NOX4. In the case of BIM we find that regulation occurs at a
post-transcriptional level. Interestingly, it has been recently
suggested that TGF-h regulates BIM by a post-translational
mechanism involving SMAD-3–dependent expression of the MAPK
phosphatase MKP2 (26). Our results suggest that NOX4 might
mediate the regulation of MKP2 by TGF-h and overactivation of
the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway in liver tumor cells would interfere
with this effect. Furthermore, in HepG2 cells, as observed in fetal
rat hepatocytes (4) and hepatoma cells (5), TGF-h is up-regulating
antiapoptotic genes, such as the members of the BCL-2 family BCLXL and MCL1. Interestingly, a significant decrease in the expression

of these genes is observed after cell treatment with TGF-h and
the MEK/ERK inhibitor, and NOX4 is required for this effect. The
consequence of all these changes in the expression pattern of the
BCL-2 family is an increase in the percentage of cells presenting
active BAX or BAK, a decrease in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and an activation of caspase-3, all these events
being blocked when NOX4 is targeted knockdown.
During the last years, numerous articles have described the
existence of NADPH oxidase homologues to the phagocytic
gp91PHOX, currently named NOX2. The enzymatic activity of
many of these NADPH oxidases is mainly modulated by regulatory
subunits or calcium binding (27). An exception is NOX4, which
seems to be independent from activators or regulatory proteins
and only require p22-PHOX to be active. Thus, NOX4 activity
has been described to be determined only by its mRNA/protein
levels (28). NOX4 activity has been localized in intracellular
membranes, such as endoplasmic reticulum (28), and preferentially
originates hydrogen peroxide as a product. Upon HepG2 cell
stimulation with TGF-h and the MEK/ERK inhibitor, up-regulation
of NOX4 in endoplasmic reticulum might generate ROS, which
would affect the correct translation/folding and/or oxidative status
of different proteins, which might have consequences on
transcription and translation of, at least, some apoptosis regulatory
genes. Due to this intracellular localization, we wondered whether
NOX4 might be affecting mechanisms of cell death promoted by
other organelles, such as lysosomal-dependent events proposed for

other death-promoting factors (29). We suggest that a cathepsin
B-mediated mechanism might play a role in the TGF-h–induced
HepG2 cell death when MEK/ERK is inhibited, but this should be a
NOX4-independent event.
In conclusion, results presented in this manuscript indicate that
overactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in liver tumor cells
might play a role in the initiation and/or development of HCC
through conferring resistance to the apoptosis induced by the
physiologic regulator TGF-h. As recently proposed, liver cancer
stem cells might also exhibit relative resistance to TGF-h–induced
apoptosis associated to up-regulation of the MAPK pathway (30).
Here we show that inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway might
switch the liver tumor cell response to TGF-h, recovering the
efficient signaling in terms of apoptosis and preventing other cell
responses that would favor tumor progression. The key molecule in
this suppressor arm should be NOX4, responsible for regulating the
expression of members of the BCL-2 family, which finally govern
mitochondrial-dependent events. The absence of standard systemic
therapy for advanced cases of HCC has changed with the recent
positive randomized trial testing the multikinase sorafenib,
which represents a breakthrough in the management of this
neoplasm (31). It is worthy to point out that sorafenib induces

tumor cell apoptosis in HCC cells, through, at least, inhibiting
the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (32). Future work will be necessary
to analyze whether these new targeted drugs might be promoting
the HCC response to TGF-h in terms of apoptosis favoring
tumor regression.
