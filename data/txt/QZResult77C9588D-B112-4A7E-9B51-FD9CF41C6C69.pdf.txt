BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes between
elderly (aged 70 years) patients treated with paclitaxel on a weekly basis and
with carboplatin (every 4 weeks) versus the standard 3-weekly regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel for first-line therapy of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer.

METHODS. Of the 444 patients enrolled, 136 (31%) were aged 70 years. Seventytwo patients were randomized to the weekly schedule (paclitaxel, 100 mg/m2
weekly for 3 of 4 weeks; carboplatin, area under the curve [AUC] 5 6 mg/mLmin

RESULTS. The response rate for elderly patients was 26% on the weekly regimen
and 19% on the standard schedule. The median survival duration for the weekly
and the standard schedules was 37 weeks and 31 weeks, respectively. The 1-year
survival rates were similar at 31% and 33%. Grade 3 to 4 anemia was more common on the weekly schedule (16% vs 6%), whereas grade 3 neuropathy was less
common (5.5% vs 9.5%). Nausea and emesis were also less frequent on the
weekly schedule.

CONCLUSIONS. Efficacy was similar between the weekly regimen and the standard
regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC
and may be advantageous based on its favorable tolerability profile. Cancer

L

ung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among
both men and women in the United States.1 Approximately one
third of patients are diagnosed with advanced stage nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and are, therefore, candidates for systemic
chemotherapy. For patients diagnosed at an advanced stage, the
goals of therapy are prolongation of life and palliation of symptoms.
Systemic chemotherapy with platinum-based doublets has been the
standard of care for advanced NSCLC in patients with a good performance status.2

Weekly Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for Elderly NSCLC Patients/Ramalingam et al.

According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results database,3 elderly patients (aged 70
years) compose about 50% of all new cases of lung
cancer. Treatment of the elderly patient population is
influenced by the presence of comorbid illness, concomitant use of medications, functional status, and
vital organ functions (hepatic, renal, and bone marrow).4 Elderly patients are often treated with suboptimal regimens because of misconceptions among
oncologists and patients of the risk-benefit ratio of
chemotherapy. Furthermore, elderly patients are
underrepresented in clinical trials,5 thus making it
difficult to extrapolate treatment data to the population at large. For all of these reasons, the optimal
treatment of elderly patients with advanced NSCLC
continues to be a subject of debate.
In Europe, single-agent chemotherapy is standard therapy for elderly patients with advanced
NSCLC. This notion is supported by data from a randomized clinical trial that demonstrated superior
survival with vinorelbine monotherapy when compared with best supportive care alone for elderly
patients with advanced NSCLC.6 Furthermore, the
combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine did not
confer any added advantage over monotherapy with
either agent.7
In the United States, clinical trials specific to the
elderly patient population have not been conducted
until recently. Therefore, current practice patterns
are primarily based on retrospective data from large
phase 3 clinical trials. Several subset analyses have
noted that elderly NSCLC patients with a good performance status tolerate platinum-based combination therapy well and experience survival benefits
similar to those of younger patients.8,9 Therefore,
carboplatin-based doublets are used for the treatment of ‘‘fit’’ elderly patients with advanced NSCLC
in the United States. In a prospectively planned subset analysis of a phase 3 study conducted by the
Cancer and Leukemia Group B, the combination of
carboplatin and paclitaxel was superior to singleagent therapy with paclitaxel for elderly NSCLC
patients.10 However, the combination regimen was
associated with more toxic events. Therefore, alternative schedules of carboplatin and paclitaxel with the
potential for less toxicity may be a more appealing
therapeutic option for elderly patients. We have earlier demonstrated that a weekly regimen of paclitaxel
in combination with carboplatin was well tolerated
by elderly patients and was associated with a favorable efficacy profile.11
We recently reported the results of the randomized phase 3 study that compared the weekly
schedule of paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 (3 weeks on, 1

543

week off) in combination with carboplatin (area
under the curve [AUC] 5 6 mg/mLmin on Day 1,
every 4 weeks) to the standard 3-weekly regimen.12
This was based on our earlier observation of
improved tolerability with the weekly regimen. There
was no significant difference in overall survival or
response rate between the weekly and the standard
regimen. However, there was a lower incidence of
neuropathy and arthralgia with the weekly regimen.
Thus, the weekly regimen of paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin is an acceptable front-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC.
We conducted a subset analysis of this phase 3
study to compare the outcomes for elderly patients
treated with the weekly regimen versus the standard
regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with previously untreated histologically or
cytologically confirmed inoperable stage IIIb or IV
NSCLC were eligible for enrollment. The eligibility
criteria, treatment plan, dose modification scheme,
and statistical methods have been published previously.12 For the purpose of this subset analysis, elderly patients were defined as those aged 70 years
at the time of entry into the study. Briefly, patients
enrolled in this study received an initial phase of
therapy that was followed by maintenance therapy
for patients who achieved an objective response or
disease stabilization on initial therapy. In the initial
therapy phase, patients on the weekly schedule
received paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 weekly for 3 of 4
weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 6 mg/mL X min on
Day 1 of each 4-week cycle. Patients on the standard
schedule received paclitaxel (225 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5 6) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.
Treatment was discontinued when 1 or more of the
following events occurred before completion of the
scheduled 4 cycles of therapy, disease progression,
development of intercurrent illness, intolerable toxicity, patient refusal of further treatment, investigator
decision to terminate treatment, or a delay in treatment of >2 weeks (excluding planned week[s] of rest
in a cycle). Patients on either treatment arm with a
complete response, partial response, or stable disease
based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) after 4 cycles were eligible to
receive the maintenance phase of therapy with
weekly paclitaxel (70 mg/m2 per week, 3 weeks on, 1
week off).
The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall
patient survival rate. Secondary efficacy endpoints
were the objective response rate for the initial phase

and the median time to disease progression (TTP)
for both the initial phase and the maintenance
phase.
For purposes of the subset analysis, the outcomes for elderly patients in the weekly and standard
arms were summarized by treatment arm, with descriptive statistics for continuous measures and
counts, and frequencies for categorical variables. TTP
was characterized by using the Kaplan-Meier
method13 and summarized by using descriptive statistics. Overall survival rates for both the initial therapy phase and the maintenance phase were also
characterized by using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Toxicities by grade were tabulated by each treatment
arm during the induction and maintenance phases.
The study was not powered to detect statistical
differences between the 2 groups.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of 444 patients enrolled into the study, 136 were
aged 70 years, 72 on the weekly schedule and 64
on the standard schedule. Baseline patient characteristics for the initial therapy phase of this study are
summarized in Table 1. The baseline characteristics
were well matched for elderly patients between the 2
treatment schedules. There was a slightly higher representation of men in the standard schedule (67% vs
63%). More than 80% of patients in each arm had
stage IV disease. There was a higher proportion of
patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
Performance Status 2 (ECOG PS2) in the standard
arm (17% vs 8%). The median ages of patients in the
weekly and standard schedules were 74 and 75 years,
respectively.

Included in the intent-to-treat analysis were 70
and 63 patients, respectively, for the weekly and the
standard schedules. Thirty-one of the 70 (44%)
patients in the weekly schedule completed all 4
cycles of combination therapy, compared with 29 of
the 63 (46%) patients in the standard arm. The median number of treatment cycles was 2 and 3,
respectively, for patients in the weekly and standard
schedules. Progression of disease was the most common reason for discontinuation of therapy for both
treatment arms (Table 2). Twenty of 31 (65%) eligible
patients in the weekly schedule and 18 of 23 (78%)
in the standard schedule received at least 1 cycle of
maintenance paclitaxel therapy. During the maintenance phase, progression of disease (53%), toxicity
requiring >2 weeks delay in therapy (8%), and
patient refusal (21%) were the major reasons for
treatment discontinuation.

Efficacy
The response rate was higher for elderly patients
treated on the weekly schedule (26% vs 19%,
P 5 .358) (Table 3). Median overall survival durations
were 37 weeks and 31 weeks, respectively, for the 2
schedules. The 1-year survival rates were also similar
at 31% and 33%, respectively, for the weekly and
standard schedules (Fig. 1). The median TTP was
18.4 weeks on the weekly schedule and 12.7 weeks
on the standard schedule.

Safety
Table 4 summarizes the toxicities experienced by the
patients at an incidence rate of 5% or greater for
both the initial treatment phase and for maintenance
therapy. There were no major differences in hematologic toxicity profiles between the weekly and the
standard schedule with the exception of grade 3 anemia, which was higher with the weekly regimen (16%
vs 6%). Overall, the nonhematologic toxicity profile
was more favorable on the weekly schedule. Grade 3
neuropathy occurred in 5.5% on the weekly schedule
compared with 9.5% on the standard regimen. Grade
3 nausea and emesis were also less frequent with the
weekly schedule.

DISCUSSION
Elderly patients account for an increasing proportion
of patients with advanced NSCLC. Chemotherapy
has clearly been documented to benefit elderly
patients, although several questions remain concerning optimal agents, combinations, and schedules for
elderly patients. The regimen of carboplatin and
paclitaxel is efficacious for front-line therapy of
advanced NSCLC and has now become an accepted
platform for the addition of targeted agents.13,14 Neuropathy and myelosuppression are common adverse
events associated with the regimen of carboplatin
and paclitaxel. Administration of paclitaxel on a
weekly schedule results in less myelosuppression and
neuropathy and is, therefore, an intriguing choice for
the treatment of elderly patients.15
We conducted a randomized phase 2 study to
evaluate 3 different weekly treatment schedules of
administration of carboplatin and paclitaxel for

patients with advanced NSCLC.16 Among the 3 regimens, the weekly administration of paclitaxel (3
weeks on, 1 week off) in combination with carboplatin (every 4 weeks) was associated with the best therapeutic index. An analysis of the outcome for elderly
patients treated with this regimen showed that there
is promising efficacy with a lower incidence of pertinent nonhematologic toxicities. Therefore, the current analysis was conducted to directly compare the
weekly schedule against the standard schedule of
carboplatin and paclitaxel.
The survival data and response rates were similar
between the 2 schedules, although numerically higher
on the weekly schedule. In general, there were no significant differences in efficacy between the elderly
and the younger patients in each treatment arm.
There was a trend toward higher incidence of fatigue,
hyperglycemia, and dehydration for elderly patients
over younger patients in both arms of the study. Leucopenia was slightly more common in the weekly
arm among elderly patients, but it was similar to that
of younger patients in the 3-weekly regimen. Overall,
there were a few important advantages with the
weekly schedule, most notably the lower incidence of
neuropathy for elderly patients. This potentially
makes the weekly schedule a preferable treatment
option for elderly NSCLC patients. Our findings are
limited somewhat by the retrospective nature of this
analysis. However, it is to be noted that current practice patterns for elderly NSCLC patients in the United
States are frequently based on subset analyses from
large randomized clinical trials. The lack of informa-

546

CANCER

tion on comorbid illness in our analysis is another limitation, because potential imbalances in outcome
based on comorbidities are unknown.
As newer targeted agents are added to standard
chemotherapy regimens in clinical trials, it is important to establish chemotherapy platforms that are
ideally suited to elderly patients. On the basis of data
from the weekly regimen, we believe that it is well
suited for testing in the front-line setting, in combination with novel agents.
Under-representation of elderly patients in clinical trials remains a major obstacle to development of
optimal treatment options for this group of patients.
There is also the potential for discordance between
the elderly patients enrolled in clinical trials versus
those in the ‘‘real world’’ setting. Optimal evaluation
of comorbid illnesses and their impact on treatment
outcomes have not been adequately studied. Because
palliation is the main intent of therapy for advanced
NSCLC patients, careful consideration of the riskbenefit ratio in elderly patients is essential for each
regimen in clinical use. The availability of noncytotoxic, molecularly targeted agents provides potential
for safer treatment options for elderly patients. A
recent phase 2 trial of erlotinib, an inhibitor of the
epidermal growth factor receptor for elderly patients,
demonstrated robust median survival for front-line
therapy of advanced NSCLC.17 Thus, individualized
treatment approaches with existing agents, and continued evaluation of other novel agents, remain
major goals for improving outcomes in elderly
NSCLC patients.
