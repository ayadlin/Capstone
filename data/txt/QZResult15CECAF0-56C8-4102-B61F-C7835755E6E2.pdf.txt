Abstract
Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4; ABCC4) is a member of
the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of membrane transport
proteins and confers resistance to nucleoside and nucleotide
analogues as well as camptothecin derivatives. MRP4 also
mediates the transmembrane transport of several eicosanoids,
conjugated estrogens, and cyclic AMP. The subcellular localization of MRP4 depends on the cell type in which it is
expressed, but the molecular determinants responsible for
trafficking of MRP4 to the plasma membrane are unknown.
Here, we describe the interaction of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) with MRP4 via the last four amino
acids (1322ETAL1325) of the transporter. Down-regulation of
NHERF1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HeLa cells significantly increased MRP4 levels at the plasma membrane,
suggesting that internalization of the transporter was inhibited. Increased plasma membrane MRP4 was accompanied
by increased efflux function as reflected by reduced cellular accumulation of the MRP4 substrates 6-mercaptopurine
and 9-[2-(phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl]-adenine. Furthermore,
enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged MRP4 was internalized in monensin-treated cells, and this internalization was
markedly reduced after NHERF1 down-regulation by siRNA.
Together, these data establish NHERF1 as a novel proteinbinding partner of MRP4 that plays a significant role in the
internalization and drug efflux function of this transporter.

Introduction
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters comprise a large superfamily of integral membrane proteins, the vast majority of which
mediate the translocation of solutes across biological membranes.
The multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) belong to subfamily C
(also referred to as ABCC) of the ABC superfamily, which contains
13 genes designated ABCC1 through ABCC13. The three best-characterized ABCC transporters, MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 (ABCC1,
ABCC2, and ABCC3), are known to transport a broad range of
chemically diverse xenobiotic conjugates and other organic anions
and are characterized by a five-domain structure with three
membrane-spanning domains (MSD) and two nucleotide-binding
domains. In contrast, MRP4 (ABCC4), MRP5 (ABCC5), MRP8
(ABCC11), and MRP9 (ABCC12) lack the NH2-terminal MSD of
MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 and thus have a more typical four-domain
ABC structure (1, 2).

The gene coding for MRP4 is located on the long arm of
chromosome 13 at band q32 (3, 4). The MRP4 mRNA transcript
encodes the smallest of the MRP-related proteins with just 1,325
amino acids. Expression of human MRP4/ABCC4 was initially reported to be restricted to a few tissues. However, subsequent
studies have shown that it is widely expressed with MRP4 mRNA
levels ranging from very high in prostate to barely detectable in
liver. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies have detected
MRP4 protein in prostate, kidney, liver, brain, and platelets as well
as in several cell lines (5).
The substrate specificity of MRP4 is very broad and only partially
overlaps with MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3. Thus, like MRP1, MRP2,
and MRP3, MRP4 transports certain glutathione (GSH) and
glucuronide conjugates and sulfated steroids, but unlike MRP1,
MRP2, and MRP3, it also transports several cyclic nucleotides, bile
acids, and unconjugated eicosanoids as well as uric acid (6–13).
MRP4 also confers resistance to nucleobase analogues such as
6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine, nucleotide analogues such as
the antiviral 9-[2-(phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl]-adenine (PMEA), and
nucleoside analogues such as ganciclovir (14–18). MRP4 is also
a resistance factor for methotrexate and several camptothecins
(8, 15, 19, 20).
The COOH terminus of MRP4 contains a consensus class I PDZ
interaction motif (ETAL; X-(S/T)-X-A, X, unspecified; A, hydrophobic residue), which is quite similar to that found in the related
proteins MRP2 (ABCC2) and CFTR (ABCC7), both of which localize
to the apical membranes of polarized cells (Fig. 1A; ref. 21). The
COOH-terminal PDZ motifs in MRP2 (STKF) and CFTR (DTRL)
have been reported to be important for their association with
Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1), also known as
ezrin-binding protein 50 (22, 23). In the case of CFTR, NHERF1
enhances the cell surface expression of this chloride channel by
increasing its recycling, whereas in the case of MRP2 the functional
consequences of its interaction with NHERF1 have not yet been
determined (23, 24).
In the present study, we have investigated the possibility that
NHERF1 also interacts with MRP4. We have found that the COOH
terminus of MRP4 directly interacts with NHERF1 in glutathione
S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, and this interaction is
abrogated by deletion of the last four amino acids of MRP4, thus
identifying ETAL as a functional PDZ interaction motif. The
association between endogenous MRP4 and NHERF1 was further
confirmed in intact HeLa and HEK293T cells. Down-regulation of
NHERF1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HeLa cells significantly increased MRP4 protein levels at the plasma membrane,
which was associated with an increase in the drug efflux activity of
the transporter. The elevated surface expression of MRP4 seems
attributable to a substantial decrease in transporter internalization,
indicating that NHERF1 is required for MRP4 internalization. Consistent with this idea, enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)tagged wt-MRP4 was found to internalize in monensin-treated

HeLa cells, and this internalization was dramatically reduced when
NHERF1 was down-regulated by siRNA. Our results thus identify
NHERF1 as a novel binding partner of MRP4 and point to a crucial
although unanticipated role for NHERF1 in MRP4 internalization
and drug efflux function.

Materials and Methods
Expression vectors. The pcDNA3.1/Hygro-MRP4 vector encoding the
full-length human MRP4 was kindly provided by Dr. Dietrich Keppler
(Heidelberg Cancer Centre, Heidelberg, Germany) and subcloned into
pcDNA3.1( ) at the Nhe1/XhoI sites to generate pcDNA3.1( )-wt-MRP4 (9).
To generate a mutant lacking the last four amino acids, pcDNA3.1( )MRP4DETAL, a 3¶ fragment encoding amino acids 966 to 1,321 of MRP4 was

amplified from pcDNA3.1( )-wt-MRP4 by PCR using Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) with the following mutagenic primer set (Integrated
DNA Technologies): (5¶-TTTTTGGAAACGTCAAGAGATGTGAAGCG-3¶ and
5¶-TTGCTCGAGCTAGAAAATAGTTAAGGTCGAGGGCTGTCCATTG-3¶),
which were designed to place a stop codon (boldface) before the last four
amino acids of MRP4 and to create a 3¶ XhoI site (underlined). The 1.1-kb
PCR fragment was digested with Eco 0109I/Xho I and cloned into
pcDNA3.1( )-wt-MRP4. To generate eGFP-tagged MRP4 (peGFP-wtMRP4) and MRP4DETAL (peGFP-MRP4DETAL) constructs, the wild-type
MRP4 cDNA and the mutant MRP4DETAL were excised from pcDNA3.1( )wt-MRP4 and pcDNA3.1( )-MRP4DETAL vectors by EcoRI digestion and
cloned into peGFP-C3 (Clontech).
To produce GST fusion proteins with different COOH-terminal
truncations, cDNA fragments encoding MRP4 amino acids 1,209 to 1,325
(MRP4-CT) and 1,210 to 1,321 (MRP4-CTDETAL) were excised from

pcDNA3.1( )-wt-MRP4 and pcDNA3.1( )-MRP4DETAL, respectively, by
BamHI/XhoI digestion and subcloned into pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences).
Cell culture and transfections. HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured
in DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum and transfected at 50% to 80% confluence
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and grown for 48 h at 37jC before
harvesting.
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as
described (25). The primary antibodies used for immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence (at 1:1,000 and 1:400 dilutions, respectively) were
as follows: rabbit anti-MRP4 (1.5–2.0 mg/mL), mouse monoclonal antibody
(mAb) against NHERF1 (1 mg/mL), and rat mAb against MRP4 (M4I-10;
f150 Ag/mL; all from Alexis Biochemicals); mouse mAb against
LAMP-2 (200 Ag/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and mouse monoclonal
anti-a-tubulin (2 mg/mL; Sigma Aldrich). Anti-GFP (FL) antibody was used
at a 1:500 dilution (200 Ag/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Down-regulation of NHERF1 by siRNA. The siRNA used to knock
down the NHERF1 mRNA was 5¶-GGAGAACAGUCGUGAAGCCTT-3¶,
designed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and synthesized
as annealed siRNAs of standard purity (Ambion). HeLa cells were transfected with either control (control #1; Ambion) or NHERF1 siRNAs as
described (26).
Drug accumulation assay. Drug accumulation experiments were
performed as described with few modifications (17). Briefly, 2.5  105
cells per well were seeded in triplicate in a six-well plate and, 24 h later,
washed and incubated with 0.25 ACi/mL of the PMEA prodrug [adenine8-3 H] bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)-9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-adenine
[bis(POM)PMEA; 10.7 Ci/mmol] or 0.5 ACi/mL of [8-14C]-6-mercaptopurine
(51 mCi/mmol) obtained from Moravek Biochemicals. After the desired
time, cell monolayers were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended
in PBS, and radioactivity of a small aliquot was determined by liquid
scintillation counting.
Indirect immunofluorescence analyses. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described (27) and fluorescence images were
collected using Leica TCS SP2 multiphoton confocal microscope equipped
with a PL APO 100/1.40 plan oil immersion lens (Leica). Images
were collected at an 8-bit depth and 1,024  1,024 pixel resolution using
LCS software (Leica).

Expression and purification of recombinant proteins in bacteria.
GST-tagged MRP4-CT and MRP4-CTDETAL fusion proteins were produced
by transforming BL21(DE3)-RIL Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene) with
pGEX-6P-2-MRP4-CT or pGEX-6P-2-MRP4-CTDETAL and incubating the
cells with 1 mmol/L isopropyl-L-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside for 3 to 4 h at
30jC. Expressed proteins were purified as described (28), and after dialyzing
against PBS (pH 7.4), their integrity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and
Coomassie blue staining.
GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation analyses. GST pull-down
experiments were performed as described with few modifications (29).
HEK293T or HeLa cells were lysed in 1 mL of lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.4), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100]
containing protease inhibitors (Roche) and cleared by centrifugation. GSHSepharose 4B beads coupled to the different GST fusion proteins were
incubated with cell lysates (1.5 mg protein) in a total volume of 1 mL
for 4 to 6 h or overnight at 4jC. After washing in lysis buffer, samples
were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations using ExactaCruz reagents
were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

Results and Discussion
Identification of NHERF1 as a binding partner of MRP4. The
role of MRP2 (ABCC2) and CFTR (ABCC7) PDZ motifs in mediating
interaction with NHERF1 has been reported previously (22, 23).
MPR4 possesses a COOH-terminal sequence that fits a PDZ
domain consensus similar to that of MRP2 and CFTR (Fig. 1A;
ref. 21), and therefore, we investigated the possibility that MRP4,
like MRP2 and CFTR, might also associate with NHERF1. In initial
experiments, a fusion protein pull-down approach was used. Two
recombinant proteins encoding the COOH-terminal 117 (1,209–
1,325 amino acids, GST-MRP4-CT) and 112 (1,210–1,321 amino
acids, GST-MRP4-CTDETAL) amino acids of MRP4 were expressed
and purified as GST fusion proteins. Equal amounts of these fusion proteins were then adsorbed onto GSH-Sepharose beads and

incubated with HEK293T cell extracts. Bound proteins were resolved
by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-NHERF1 antibody.
As shown in Fig. 1B (top half ), GST-MRP4-CT, which contains
the putative PDZ interaction motif, efficiently pulled down
NHERF1 (lane 3). In contrast, GST-MRP4-CTDETAL and GST alone
did not detectably bind to NHERF1 in the cell lysates under the
same conditions (lanes 2 and 4). Comparable results were obtained
when pull-down experiments were performed with HeLa cell
extracts (Fig. 1B, bottom half ). Thus, GST-MRP4-CT, but not
MRP4-CTDETAL, can associate with endogenous NHERF1 in both
HEK293T and HeLa cells. This interaction between MRP4 and
NHERF1 is expected to occur in other species because the ETAL
sequence of human MRP4 is present in the MRP4 protein sequences
of all other species known to date (mouse, rat, dog, and cow).

MRP4 associates with NHERF1 in intact cells. We next wished
to determine if full-length MRP4 also associates with NHERF1 in a
cellular context. Thus, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected
with eGFP-wt-MRP4 or eGFP-MRP4DETAL recombinant constructs, cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were
performed with an anti-GFP antibody. After immunoblotting with
anti-NHERF1 antibody, severalfold higher amounts of NHERF1
were observed in coimmunoprecipitates of lysates prepared from
eGFP-wt-MRP4–expressing cells than with lysates from cells
expressing eGFP-MRP4DETAL (Fig. 1C, lane 3 versus lane 7).
Immunoblotting of the same membrane with an anti-GFP antibody
confirmed that equal amounts of recombinant eGFP-wt-MRP4 and
eGFP-MRP4DETAL proteins were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1D,
lanes 3 and 7). These data confirmed the specificity of the

left untreated. A, red, cells were analyzed by

Note that eGFP-wt-MRP4 membrane localization is

monensin-treated cells, eGFP-wt-MRP4 accumulated
in large intracellular vesicles that also contain LAMP-2

compartments. B, red, cells were further analyzed

interactions between NHERF1 and MRP4 via the four COOHterminal amino acids of the transport protein. Thus, our studies
add MRP4 to the list of ABCC/MRP subfamily members having a
COOH-terminal PDZ interaction motif that interacts with NHERF1.
To determine whether endogenous MRP4 and NHERF1 physically interact in intact cells, HeLa cell extracts were prepared
and immunoprecipitated with an anti-NHERF1 antibody and then
immunoblotted with a rat anti-MRP4 mAb (Fig. 2A, top). The same
membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-NHERF1
antibody (Fig. 2A, bottom). These experiments revealed the
coimmunoprecipitation of a protein complex containing endogenous MRP4 and NHERF1 (Fig. 2A, top and bottom). In addition,
when similar immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were performed with HEK293T cell extracts, comparable results were obtained (data not shown). The MRP4 mAb
detected two bands with electrophoretic mobilities of approximately 160 and 180 kDa. The upper band is most likely a
glycosylated form of MRP4 because treatment with peptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase F) reduced its size to 160 kDa (Fig. 2B).
MRP4 was not detectable in a complex with normal mouse
IgG, showing the specificity of the interaction between NHERF1
and MRP4.
We next investigated the colocalization of MRP4 and NHERF1 in
HEK293T cells by confocal microscopy using a rat anti-MRP4 mAb
and a mouse anti-NHERF1 mAb. Significant amounts of MRP4
and NHERF1 were found to colocalize on the plasma membrane
(Fig. 2C). Both proteins also localized to some degree on internal
structures. These observations were specific because cells immunostained without primary antibodies did not produce any fluorescent signals (data not shown).

Depletion of NHERF1 from HeLa cells by RNA interference
increases MRP4 expression levels. To better understand the role
of MRP4-associated NHERF1, NHERF1 was depleted in HeLa cells
using siRNA. We found that our siRNA directed against NHERF1
completely eliminated expression of the NHERF1 protein in HeLa
cells after 96 h, and the most effective way to deplete NHERF1 was to
transfect the cells twice with a 48-h interval between transfections.
By phase-contrast microscopy, the NHERF1 siRNA–treated cells
seemed healthy (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A (top), NHERF1
protein was undetectable by immunoblotting after knockdown
with NHERF1 siRNA, whereas a strong signal was detected in control
siRNA–treated cells. Furthermore, in HeLa cells where NHERF1
expression was completely abrogated, the levels of MRP4 protein
were significantly increased (f3-fold; Fig. 3A, middle).
We also investigated the localization of MRP4 in NHERF1depleted HeLa cells by double immunofluorescence labeling. In
control siRNA-transfected cells, most of the MRP4 and NHERF1
proteins were colocalized in internal structures (yellow signal),
although small amounts of both proteins were also detected on the
plasma membrane (Fig. 3B, top). In contrast, MRP4 staining was
brighter and mostly associated with the plasma membrane in
NHERF1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3B, bottom). These results are
consistent with the immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A).
To better understand if the elevated levels of MRP4 protein at the
plasma membrane observed in NHERF1 down-regulated HeLa cells
were associated with increased MRP4 function, cellular accumulation of the MRP4 substrates [3H]bis(POM)PMEA and [14C]6mercaptopurine was determined (7, 17). As shown in Fig. 3C,
cellular accumulation of [3H]bis(POM)PMEA and [14C]6-mercaptopurine (data not shown) was significantly reduced in HeLa cells

Regulation of MRP4 Expression and Function by NHERF1

treated with NHERF1 siRNA compared with control siRNA–treated
cells after both 6 and 20 h of incubations with the drugs. These
observations indicate that the higher level of MRP4 expression at
the plasma membrane that accompanies down-regulation of
NHERF1 is associated with greater drug efflux activity resulting
in lower levels of drug accumulation in the cells. The lower levels of
drug accumulation at 20 h versus 6 h in Fig. 3C are presumably due
to the efflux activity of endogenous MRP4.
eGFP-wt-MRP4 trafficking between the plasma membrane
and endocytic compartments. Monensin is a Na+ ionophore that
disrupts intracellular Na+ and H+ gradients leading to retention of
internalized membrane proteins in intracellular vesicles because
their recycling to the plasma membrane is inhibited (30). Thus,
monensin treatment would be expected to reduce surface expression of eGFP-wt-MRP4. In addition, because monensin blocks protein degradation and trafficking out of late endosomes and
lysosomes, eGFP-wt-MRP4 would be expected to accumulate in
LAMP-2(+) late endosomes and lysosomes (30).

As shown in Fig. 4A (bottom), monensin treatment reduced the
level of eGFP-wt-MRP4 residing at the cell surface and enhanced
localization of eGFP-wt-MRP4 in intracellular structures containing
LAMP-2 as anticipated. In contrast, in the absence of monensin,
most of the eGFP-wt-MRP4 remained on the plasma membrane
and only a small amount was associated with intracellular structures (Fig. 4A, top). Confocal analyses with the Golgi-specific antiTGN46 antibody showed no overlap of the eGFP and TGN46 signals
in either the presence or absence of monensin, indicating that
eGFP-wt-MRP4 is not retained in the Golgi (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that monensin blocks the movement of newly synthesized eGFP-wt-MRP4 to the cell surface and
traps plasma membrane–derived eGFP-wt-MRP4 in late endocytic
compartments.
NHERF1 down-regulation inhibits MRP4 internalization
in HeLa cells. To further investigate the role NHERF1 plays in
MRP4 internalization, we next examined MRP4 internalization in
NHERF1 down-regulated HeLa cells. Thus, after first treating

HeLa cells with NHERF1 siRNA, eGFP-wt-MRP4 was ectopically
expressed and cells were exposed to monensin. Cells were also
immunostained with anti-LAMP-2 antibodies to visualize endogenous LAMP-2.
As shown in Fig. 5A (bottom), exposure of control siRNA–treated
cells to monensin reduced the level of eGFP-wt-MRP4 surface
expression and increased the localization of eGFP-wt-MRP4 in
intracellular structures containing LAMP-2. In the absence of
monensin, however, the majority of the eGFP-wt-MRP4 remained
on the cell surface (Fig. 5A, top). In contrast, monensin addition
did not change eGFP-wt-MRP4 surface expression in the NHERF1depleted cells (Fig. 5B, bottom) and levels of eGFP-wt-MRP4
membrane expression were similar to those of cells not treated
with monensin (Fig. 5B, top). Quantitative analyses further revealed
that monensin induced the localization of eGFP-wt-MRP4 in
intracellular vesicles containing LAMP-2 in 98% of cells when
treated with control siRNA. In contrast, monensin failed to induce
eGFP-wt-MRP4 localization in intracellular vesicles in 75% of
cells lacking NHERF1 (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C). Immunoblot analyses of
these cells confirmed complete depletion of NHERF1 protein after
siRNA treatment, whereas a strong NHERF1 band was observed in
control siRNA–treated cells (Fig. 5D, top). In cells where NHERF1
expression was completely abrogated, the levels of MRP4 protein
were significantly increased as before (Fig. 5D, middle).
The increase in plasma membrane MRP4 in NHERF1-depleted
cells could result from decreased internalization of MRP4 or from
increased recycling of the transporter through the endosomes or
both. To distinguish among these possibilities, we examined the
effects of monensin on MRP4 trafficking because this ionophore
selectively inhibits the endocytic recycling of membrane proteins but
does not affect their internalization (31, 32). Monensin treatment
of NHERF1-depleted cells markedly reduced internalization of
eGFP-wt-MRP4 in the majority of cells, and it therefore seems likely
that decreased internalization rather than increased recycling is
largely responsible for the increased plasma membrane expression
of MRP4 that is observed in the absence of NHERF1. Thus, our
data support the conclusion that interaction between NHERF1 and
MRP4 is required for the internalization of the latter protein.
Similar to MRP4, the internalization of the activation-independent
parathyroid hormone receptor PTH1R (which also has a canonical
class I PDZ interaction motif) requires NHERF1 (33). In the case of
PTH1R, the capacity of NHERF1 to establish cell-specific effects on
PTH1R internalization was tested in three independent ways and it
was concluded that the role of NHERF1 is not necessarily an ‘‘active’’
one but rather that the interactions between the PTH1R, NHERF1,
and the cytoskeleton confer sufficient membrane stability on PTH1R
for internalization (33). However, in contrast to our observations

here with MRP4 and that reported for PTH1R, it seems that the
internalization of wild-type CFTR and its PDZ motif deletion
mutant, CFTR-DTRL, does not differ in polarized epithelial cells.
Instead, recycling of the CFTR-DTRL mutant is reduced relative to
wild-type CFTR (24). Thus, the role of NHERF1 in MRP4 trafficking
to the plasma membrane differs quite dramatically from its role in
trafficking of the related CFTR. Intriguingly, it has been reported very
recently that MRP4 physically and functionally associates with CFTR
via the PDZ scaffolding protein PDZK1 in certain cell types (34).
Thus, it seems that inhibition of MRP4-mediated cyclic AMP
transport potentiates adenosine-stimulated CFTR chloride currents
at apical surfaces of gut epithelia in a microcompartmentalized
fashion. Our present studies showing the functional interaction of
MRP4 with NHERF1 establishes that the physical association of
MRP4 with a second PDZ scaffolding protein can regulate the more
global drug efflux activity of this transporter.
Finally, in the case of the h2-adrenergic receptor, expression of
this G protein–coupled protein was down-regulated when its
interaction with NHERF1 was disrupted, unlike MRP4, which we
have shown is up-regulated at the plasma membrane in NHERF1depleted cells. Thus, in the absence of functional NHERF1,
endocytosed h2-adrenergic receptors are sorted to lysosomes ( for
degradation) instead of being recycled back to the plasma
membrane. Therefore, it has been concluded that NHERF1 has a
critical role in recycling of h2-adrenergic receptors to the plasma
membrane (35). It has also been determined that the serine residue
(Ser411) in the PDZ interaction motif of the h2-adrenergic receptor
must be phosphorylated by the serine/threonine kinase G protein–
coupled receptor kinase-5 in order for proper recycling of the
receptor to take place (35). Whether phosphorylation of the
threonine residue in the MRP4 PDZ interaction motif ETAL affects
its interaction with NHERF1, or internalization of the transporter
and, if so, what kinase is involved awaits further investigation.
