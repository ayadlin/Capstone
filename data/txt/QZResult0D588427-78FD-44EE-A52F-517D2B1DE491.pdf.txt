ABSTRACT
Cell division cycle 25B is a key cell cycle regulator and widely considered as
potent clinical drug target for cancers. This research focused on identifying potential
compounds in theory which are able to disrupt transient interactions between CDC25B
and its CDK2/Cyclin A substrate.
By using the method of ZDOCK and RDOCK, the most optimized 3D structure
of CDK2/Cyclin A in complex with CDC25B was constructed and validated using
two methods: 1) the superimposition of proteins; 2) analysis of the hydrogen bond
distances of Arg 488(N1)-Asp 206(OD1), Arg 492(NE)-Asp 206(OD1), Arg 492(N1)Asp 206(OD2) and Tyr 497(NE)-Asp 210(OD1). A series of new compounds was
gained through searching the fragment database derived from ZINC based on the
known inhibitor-compound 7 by the means of “replace fragment” technique. The
compounds acquired via meeting the requirements of the absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion (ADME) predictions. Finally, 12 compounds with better
binding affinity were identified. The comp#1, as a representative, was selected to be
synthesized and assayed for their CDC25B inhibitory activities. The comp#1 exhibited
mild inhibitory activities against human CDC25B with IC50 values at about 39.02
μM. Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation revealed that the new inhibitor-comp#1
had favorable conformations for binding to CDC25B and disturbing the interactions
between CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin A.

INTRODUCTION

need for identifying novel and efficient agents to cure the
cancer should be paid more attentions.
Cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) dual specificity
phosphatases which consist of CDC25A, CDC25B and
CDC25C acted as important regulators of cell cycle
progression by activating the cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs) through removal of inhibitory phosphates from
tyrosine and threonine residues [5, 6]. The cell cycle is
divided into four phases: a Gap phase (G1), the phase of
DNA replication (S), a second Gap phase (G2) and mitosis
(M), which splits itself into two daughter cells. CDC25B
plays a significant role in regulating the G2/M phase

According to the latest statistics of morbidity and
mortality in cancer, more than 8.2 million people died and
approximately 14 million new cases appeared in 2012,
more seriously, the deaths will rise to 13 million annually
and an estimated 22 million new cases will arise per year
over the next two decades [1]. Cancers of lung (19.4%
of the total), liver (9.1%), and stomach (8.8%) processed
the highest mortality, which are caused by disordered cell
cycle and irregularities such as deletions, over-expression,
or mutations in the molecules [2–4]. Therefore, the urgent

transition through the activity on CDK2 kinase [7, 8]. In
view of the role in cell cycle progression, it is apparently
that CDC25B is closely related with oncogenesis. The overexpression of CDC25B is often found in numerous human
tumors, including lung cancer cells [9], liver tumor cells
[10] and stomach cancer cells [11], resulting in an excess of
CDK2/Cyclin A activation and accelerating cell proliferation,
which is associated with a poor clinical prognosis. Therefore,
CDC25B has become an attractive anticancer target [12–14].
In fact, quite a lot of efforts on discovering
CDC25B phosphatase inhibitors have been conducted for
many years. However, most potent inhibitors, including
quinonoids, phosphate surrogates and electrophilic
entities, might irreversibly oxidize the catalytic cysteine
in the active site of CDC25B enzyme which are conserved
among many PTPs [15, 16] or cause the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) enhancing their potential
toxicity and limiting their applications in therapy [17].
Indeed, there are two obstacles on the way to find new
potent inhibitors of CDC25B. Firstly, due to the crystal
structure of the catalytic domains of CDC25B [18] with
a small and shallow active site, it’s not easy to provide
a well-defined binding pocket. Secondly, the highly
reactive catalytic cysteine in the active site of CDC25B
hampers discovering CDC25B inhibitors [15]. Thus,
one therapeutic strategy focuses on identifying potential
compounds which are able to disrupt transient interactions
between CDC25B and its CDK2/Cyclin A substrate.
Many studies have indicated that computer aided
drug design (CADD) such as molecular docking [19],
protein-protein docking [20, 21] and molecular dynamic
simulation [22, 23], has been a time-saving and costreduction approach to find novel and efficient agents.
The compound 7 with the sulfate moiety attached to
the 2-fluoro-4-hydroxybenzonitrile core [24] can disrupt
the protein-protein interaction of CDC25B with CDK2/
Cyclin A substrate and inhibit the phosphatase activity
of CDC25B with weak inhibition( IC50 1 mM). It is a
very good starting point for the development of more
potent inhibitors through disrupting the protein-protein
interactions of CDC25B with CDK2/Cyclin A substrate
based on the compound 7.
The present study was initiated in an attempt to screen
the fragment database hoping to find new CDC25B inhibitors
for treating cancer with the help of Discovery Studio 3.5
software (DS 3.5; Accelrys Co. Ltd, San Diego, California,
USA). Meanwhile, the techniques of ZDOCK and RDOCK
were used to construct the most optimized 3D structure
of CDK2/Cyclin A in complex with CDC25B, followed
by “replace fragment” to modify the lead compoundcompound 7. The ADME predictions were also used to
evaluate whether the new inhibitors found here possessed
great potential to become promising drug candidates. The
comp#1, as a representative, was selected to be synthesized
and assayed for their CDC25B inhibitory activities. The
comp#1 exhibited mild inhibitory activities against human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CDC25B with IC50 values at about 39.02 μM. Subsequently,
CDOCKER and MD simulation were utilized to analyze
the binding interactions between the potential inhibitor and
receptor. Molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface
area (MM/PBSA) was further employed to explore the
relationships between the inhibitor and receptor.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Acquisition of the structure of CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A complex
Since no CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A complex has
been reported, ZDOCK and RDOCK programs were used
to obtain the complex structure of CDC25B: CDK2/Cyclin
A. ZDOCK is a docking program that predicts all possible
binding poses in the translational and rotational space
between the ligand and receptor and evaluates each pose
using ZDOCK score, an energy-based scoring function [28].
ZDOCK generated 60 clusters containing 2000 structures
and ranked them according to their ZDOCK score. While,
RDOCK is a program designed to refine and re-rank top
predictions from ZDOCK using energy minimization
algorithm [26]. The top 100 poses selected from ZDOCK
were further refined and evaluated by E_RDOCK. The results
derived from RDOCK involving five CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin
A binding modes have been listed in Table 1.
To evaluate whether the docking protocol was reliable,
the validation was performed using the method mentioned
above. The RMSD between the five docked poses and their
actual X-ray poses in the crystal structure was 0.32 Å, 0.40
Å, 0.35 Å, 0.44 Å, 0.36 Å for CDC25B and 0.40 Å, 0.38 Å,
0.42 Å, 0.34 Å, 0.43 Å for CDK2/Cyclin A, respectively,
indicating that these docked poses could be used to further
validate by MD simulations. Arg 488, Arg 492 and Tyr 497
in CDC25B have been served as crucial residues in substrate
recognition which were found to contact with Asp 206 and
Asp 210 in CDK2/Cyclin A. The distances of 4 hydrogen
bonds (Arg 488(N1)-Asp 206(OD1), Arg 492(NE)-Asp
206(OD1), Arg 492(N1)-Asp 206(OD2) and Tyr 497(OH)Asp 210(OD1)) of the five binding modes were monitored
and calculated. The mean distances of the four hydrogen
bonds (Arg 488(N1)-Asp 206(OD1), Arg 492(NE)-Asp
206(OD1), Arg 492(N1)-Asp 206(OD2) and Tyr 497(OH)Asp 210(OD1)) (pose 1) maintained at 0.31 nm, 0.30 nm,
0.31 nm and 0.29 nm, respectively (Figure 1). This means
that each distance was within the scope of the reported
distance [31, 32]. However, the mean distances of the other
four poses were moved out of the reasonable distances,
indicating that pose 1 was reliable to further analysis.

lead compound- CDC25B inhibitor to develop novel
therapeutic agents for treating cancer with an IC50 of 1
mM, was divided into three parts, Scaffold A, Scaffold
B and Scaffold C (Figure 2). By the means of “replace
fragment” technique, the three parts were replaced through
searching the fragment database constructed by “Generate
fragment libraries” which were mentioned in materials
and methods. The 1st step was aimed at the A part
generating 4 scaffolds, Scaffold A1, Scaffold A2, Scaffold
A3, Scaffold A4. The 2nd step was aimed at the B part
generating 5 scaffolds, Scaffold B1, Scaffold B2, Scaffold
B3, Scaffold B4 and Scaffold B5 to replace B. The 3rd
step was aimed at C part generating 5 scaffolds, Scaffold
C1, Scaffold C2, Scaffold C3, Scaffold C4 and Scaffold
C5, to replace C. Hence, there were approximately 100
different combinations thus generated. Subsequently,
all the compounds were then screened by meeting
the requirements of ADME to exclude non drug like
compounds, finally, 24 compounds were obtained.
Before docking, the binding pocket of
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A was defined by a set of key
residues of the receptor with a distance less than 5 Å from

a heavy atom of the ligand. To evaluate the applicability
of CDOCKER in the present study, the original co-crystal
ligand-compound 7 from the PDB structure was re-docked
into the X-ray structure of the receptor. The root mean
square deviation (RMSD) between the docked poses and
their actual X-ray poses in the crystal structure are 1.1955
Å for CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A complex [29]. Hence,
the 24 hits were further docked into the binding pocket
of CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A using the method we have
described earlier. The compound 7, as a positive control
compound, was selected to compare the docking results of
other compounds. The top 12 compounds which showed
higher binding energy than compound 7(-CDOCKER_
ENERGY= 18.46 kcal/mol) were gained and listed
in Table 2. Of the 12 derivatives, the comp#1, has the
strongest binding affinity with CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A,
and hence it is singled out for further investigation.
The results of receptor-ligand interactions obtained
from the docking simulation were shown in Figure 3,
where panel A displayed the binding pattern of the
reference inhibitor compound 7 and comp#1 in the active
site of CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A, panel B described the

colored in magenta) in the active site (Phe386, D397,
Leu398, K399, Cys484, R485, Arg488, Arg 492 and
Met505), while panel C and D showed the 2D diagrams
between CDC25B and compound 7 and comp#1,
respectively.
The pink rectangles in 2D diagram mainly
represented polar interactions including hydrogen
bonds and charge interactions and the green rectangles
represented nonpolar interactions including van der waals
interactions and hydrophobic interactions. In the 2D
diagram of CDC25B-compound 7, shown in Figure 3C,
compound 7 could form van der waals and hydrophobic
interactions with the residues such as Gly 380, Phe
386, Leu 398, Leu 500 and hydrogen bonds and charge
interactions with the residues such as Tyr 382, Asp 397,
Lys 399, Cys 484, Arg 485, Arg 488 and Arg 492. The
phenyl ring of part A in compound 7 inserted into the
pocket formed by the side chains of Leu 398 and Arg
488, forming hydrophobic and cation-Pi interactions,
respectively. The nitrile nitrogen of part B and fluorine
of part A in compound 7 pointed towards the backbone of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Arg 485 and Cys 484, respectively. The three conservative
H-bond interactions formed between O1,O3 of part C in
compound 7and the two key residues of CDC25B, Arg
488 and Arg 492 required for CDK2 substrate recognition
[32] was observed in our docking study. The Figure 3D
described the 2D diagram of CDC25B-comp#1, showing
that hydrogen bond, charge interactions were formed
by the residues such as Tyr 382, Cys 484, Arg 485, Arg
488 and Arg 492, while van der waals and hydrophobic
interactions could be generated with the residues such
as Phe 386, Asp 397, Leu 398, Lys 399, Glu 489, Tyr
497, Pro 503, Glu 504 and Met 505. The Scaffold A1 in
comp#1 (Figure 2) located in the same place to part A in
compound 7, buried into the hydrophobic area, including
Phe 386, Leu398, Lys 399, Pro503, Glu 504 and Pro
505. The sulphur of Scaffold A1 in comp#1 oriented to
Arg 485, forming a hydrogen bond. The O9 of Scaffold
A1 and O27, O28 of Scaffold C1 of comp#1 formed four
hydrogen bonds with the residues of Tyr 382, Arg 488
and Arg 492, respectively. The phenyl ring of Scaffold
C1 in comp#1 formed two cation-Pi interactions with the
residues of Arg 492 and Arg 488. In addition, the Scaffold
B1 also formed a cation-Pi interaction with residue Arg

hydrogen bonds and two more cation-Pi interactions with
the receptor CDC25B than compound 7 , accounting for
the higher docking score of comp#1 to CDC25B than
compound 7.

In the present work, we just chose comp#1 as a
representive compound to synthesize. The main purpose
here is to test the correctness of the hypothesis. The
comp#1 was synthesized as shown in Scheme 1.
Ethyl 4-(4-oxo-2-phenylthiazolidin-3-yl)benzoate
To a solution of methyl triphenyl phosphonium
bromide (8.26 g, 50 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (300 mL) was added benzaldehyde (10.61 g, 100
mmol) at 0°C and the reaction stirred for 5 min. Then
2-mercaptoacetic acid (7.00 mL, 100 mmol) was added
dropwise and DCC (12.40 g, 60 mmol) was added in
batches and the reaction was stirred at 0°C for 5 min.
Then, the reaction mixture was naturally heated to room
temperature and stirred at room temperature for 3 h. TLC
and LC-MS examination showed that most of the starting
material was converted into the target compound. The
mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (350 mL) (×3),
and washed with 5% citric acid (70 ml) (×3) , water (70 ml)

also calculated for in depth analysis of the interactions
of the three complexes, CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin
A-comp#1, CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound 7 and
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-uncomplexed system. It can be
seen from the Figure 4B–4D that comp#1 and compound 7
both bound to CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A altered the RMSF
of the key amino acid residues, respectively. The RMSF
fluctuated large, which meant the residues were unstable,
whereas the RMSF fluctuated small, which meant the
residues were stable.
The plot B displayed the residues of CDC25B in
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 and CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A-compound 7 complexes shared similar RMSF
distributions and similar trends of dynamic features.
The three regions (Gly 380-Phe 386, Thr 390-Tyr 400,
Cys 484-Tyr 506) fluctuated lower in CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A-comp#1 system than CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin
A-compound 7 system, which means the inhibitor
comp#1 made CDC25B more stable than compound
7 did. The Figure 4C and 4D showed the fluctuation of
RMSF in CDK2/Cyclin A after the inhibitor comp#1
and compound 7 bound to CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A. It
is noteworthy that almost all residues in CDK2/Cyclin A
displayed minor difference in the overall curves, except
the residues Asp 206-Asp 210 in CDK2 of CDC25B
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 and CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A-compound 7. Asp 206 and Asp 210 played an
important role in binding to CDC25B. Thus, it can be
concluded that the inhibitors comp#1 and compound 7
both bound to CDC25B reduced the contact between the
protein CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin A.
To understand the specific interactions between
protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes, the binding
free energy was calculated using MM/PBSA approach
composed of four terms, i.e., the van der waals interaction
energy, the electrostatic energy, the polar solvation free
energy, and the non-polar solvation free energy. For all
systems, each snapshot structures were extracted during
equilibrium phase in the last 10 ns trajectory to calculate
the binding free energy.

The binding free energy and detailed contributions
of the four energy components obtained from the MM/
PBSA calculation of the protein-protein and proteinligand complexes are listed in Table 3. As shown in
Table 3, the binding energy of the CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A was the lowest among the three protein-protein
complexes, i.e., CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A (binding
with comp#1), CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A (binding with
compound 7) and CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A. The binding
energy of CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A was estimated to
be -171.806 kJ/mol, and the CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A
(binding with comp#1) and CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A
(binding with compound 7) were respectively estimated
to be -3.638 kJ/mol and -42.449 kJ/mol. We can clearly
see that the electrostatic interactions were the major
favorable contributions to the binding energies between
CDK2/Cyclin A and CDC25B in the three systems.
However, the contributions of electrostatic interactions
negatively contributed to the total energy were
completely counteracted by the opposite stronger polar
solvation. Therefore, taking van der waals, electrostatic
interaction, non-polar solvation and polar solvation into
considerations, CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A was the most
stable system, which meant that the ligands comp#1 and
compound 7 both decreased the binding affinity between
CDK2/Cyclin A and CDC25B.
To Figure out how the ligands influenced the
interactions between CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin
A, the binding free energy between the protein and
ligand were also calculated. The Table 3 displayed that
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 possessed higher

that van der waals, electrostatic interactions and non-polar
solvation energy together are in favor of the stability of the
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 and CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A-compound 7 complexes. For negative
contribution, van der waals interactions offered greater
contributions than electrostatic interactions and the nonpolar free energy which possessed less the total binding
energy as for the CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1
system, while for CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound
7 system, electrostatic interactions possessed the most
among the three components. Consistent with the results of
molecular docking (Figure 3), van der waals interactions
played the main role in CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1
system, while in CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A -compound 7
system, electrostatic interactions played the major role.
In addition, compared with CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin
A-compound 7 system, comp#1 bound to CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A exhibited higher van der waals, representing
much more hydrophobic interactions, which promoted the
stability of CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 system.
Hence, due to the ligand bound to CDC25B, it
changed the conformation of the protein CDC25B,
thus, decreased the binding energy between CDC25B
and CDK2/Cyclin A. In addition, the system of
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 seemed more stable
than CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound 7, accounting
for the high energy between CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin
A when bound to comp#1.
The binding energy decomposition method
by residues was employed to better understand how
comp#1 and compound 7 influenced the interactions
between CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin A. The Figure 5
displayed the contributions of individual residue to the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

whole binding for CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A (binding
with comp#1), CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A (binding with
compound 7) and CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A systems.
It is observed that the residues (Arg 488, Aeg 492 and
Tyr 497) in CDK interactions site of CDC25B and
Asp 206, Asp 210 of CDK2/Cyclin A displayed large
conformational change. Previous study has demonstrated
that the residue Asp 206 of CDK2/Cyclin A formed
three hydrogen bonds with Arg 488 and Arg 492 of
CDC25B, and residue Asp 210 of CDK2/Cyclin A
formed a hydrogen bond with Tyr 497 of CDC25B [32].
Compared with the system of CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A,
the energy of five important residues showed an obvious
increase, the decomposition energy of Arg 488, Arg 492
and Tyr 497 in CDC25B (bind with comp#1) varies in
the range from -9.01 kJ/mol to 4.55 kJ/mol, -15.83 kJ/
mol to -1.27 kJ/mol and -3.82 kJ/mol to 0.14 kJ/mol,
respectively, and in CDC25B (binding with compound
7) were from -9.01 kJ/mol to 0.59 kJ/mol, -15.83 kJ/
mol to -1.07 kJ/mol and -3.82 kJ/mol to 0.28  kJ/mol,
respectively, while the decomposition energy of Asp 206
and Asp 210 in CDK2/Cyclin A (binding with comp#1)
was from -18.15 kJ/mol to -2.61 kJ/mol and -7.04 kJ/
mol to 2.06 kJ/mol, respectively, and in CDK2/Cyclin
A (binding with compound 7) changed from -18.15
kJ/mol to -3.65 kJ/mol and -7.04 kJ/mol to -0.57 kJ/
mol, respectively, (Figure 5A). The rise of the binding
energy declared that the interactions between the
two proteins have been weakened. The comp#1 and
compound 7 occupied the position of CDK interaction
site in CDC25B, which caused the decrease the contacts
between the key residues, accounting for the increase of
the decomposition energy.

A further analysis between protein-ligand systems,
including CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 and
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound 7 complexes was
shown in Figure 5B to better understand how comp#1
and compound 7 were bound to CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin
A, respectively. The key residues were observed in three
significantly different regions (Gly 380-Phe 386, Thr 390Tyr 400, Cys 484-Tyr 506) of CDC25B, which was in
accordance with the RMSF results in Figure 4. The major
residues of CDC25B in CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1
and CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound 7 contributed

to the binding free energy varied in the range from -0.43
to -22.66 kJ/mol and -23.48 to 3.31 kJ/mol, respectively.
For CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound 7, the key
residues of CDC25B were Gly 380, Tyr 382, Phe 386,
Asp 397, Leu 398, Lys 399, Cys 484, Arg 485, Arg 488,
Arg 492, Met 505, while some other residues (Glu 489,
Tyr 497, Pro 503, Glu 504) also played an important role
in CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 system. Compared
with compound 7, the energy of amino acids Tyr 382, Leu
398, Cys 484, Arg 485 and Met 505 of CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A-comp#1 system showed remarkable decrease.

The decomposition energy changed from -0.13 kJ/mol
to -10.14 kJ/mol, -4.56 kJ/mol to -8.69 kJ/mol, -0.51 kJ/
mol to -4.49 kJ/mol, -3.42 kJ/mol to -13.27 kJ/mol and
-0.47 kJ/mol to -4.45 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, the
decomposition energy of residues Tyr 497, Pro 503 and
Glu 504 also has a notable decrease, altering from -0.35
kJ/mol to -3.24 kJ/mol, 0.30 kJ/mol to -2.45 kJ/mol and
3.31 kJ/mol to -2.85 kJ/mol, respectively. The decrease
of the binding free energy indicated that the interactions
between these eight residues have been strengthened. One
reason was that comp#1 bound to CDC25B increased the
electronic interactions between the residues and protein
CDC25B. As shown in Figure 3, the Scaffold C1 of
comp#1 was pointed close to Tyr 382 and Arg 492, which
was beneficial to form more stable interactions, like
hydrogen bond and cation-Pi interactions. The Scaffold
A1 and Scaffold B1 in comp#1 were located nearly to
Arg 485, which increased the opportunity to form a
hydrogen bond and cation-Pi interactions with it. The
other reason was that the Scaffold A1 of comp#1 formed
more hydrophobic interactions with residues Pro 503, Glu
504 and Met 505.
In summary, the decomposition energy of the
residues Arg 488, Arg 492 and Tyr 497 in CDC25B
and the residues Asp 206 and Asp 210 in CDK2/Cyclin
A varied a lot, revealing that comp#1 and compound 7
hampered the interactions between CDC25B and CDK2/

Cyclin A. Furthermore, although the binding pattern was
same between comp#1 and compound 7, respectively,
bound to CDC25B, comp#1 bound to CDC25B could be
more stable, which made it more conducive to interrupt
the contact between CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin A.
The stability of a three-dimensional structure of the
protein is decided by a subtle balance among all kinds of weak
interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, conjugation interactions,
hydrophobic interactions and so on, of which hydrogen bonds
play the most important role in stabilizing the system.
Figure 6 displayed the distance fluctuations of
the active residues with the atoms of the ligand that
were included in the hydrogen bond interactions. It is
observed that all the important hydrogen bonds which
have been shown in the initial docking models were
maintained during the MD simulations. For example,
in CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound 7 system, one
hydrogen bond formed between O1 of compound 7 and
Arg 488 in CDC25B and two hydrogen bonds formed
between O1, O3 of compound 7and Arg 492 in CDC25B,
while in CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 system, two
hydrogen bonds formed between O27 of comp#1 and
Tyr 382 and Tyr 492 in CDC25B, respectively, another
hydrogen bond formed between S2 of comp#1 and Arg 485
and other two hydrogen bonds between O9 of comp#1 and
Arg 488 and O28 of comp#1 and Arg 492, respectively,
were maintained through the entire simulation.

In CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 system, the
distances of five hydrogen bonds (Tyr 382-O27, Arg 485S2, Arg 488-O9, Arg 492-O27, Arg 492-O28, respectively)
were fluctuated from 0.25 nm to 0.32 nm, which remained
within hydrogen bonds distance throughout the whole
simulation, indicating that the five hydrogen bonds played
vital role in the entire time period to stabilize the receptorligand complex. In CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound
7 system, the average distances of the three hydrogen
bonds (Arg 488-O1, Arg 492-O1, Arg 492-O3) were
about 0.31 nm, 0.31 nm and 0.30 nm, respectively. At the

beginning of the simulation, the distance of hydrogen bond
interaction between Arg 488 and O1 of the compound
7 fluctuated large and was beyond the hydrogen bond
distance. Then, it tended to be stable and almost remained
within the reasonable hydrogen bond distance from 3 ns
to the end. The other two hydrogen bonds were almost
remained within hydrogen bond distance for the entire
duration of the simulation. However, the hydrogen bond
interactions between compound 7 and Tyr 382 and Arg
485 were absent, revealing that this hydrogen bond of
comp#1 with CDC25B made the system more stable.

To Figure out whether these stable hydrogen bonds
formed between the ligand (comp#1 and compound 7) and
Arg 488, Arg 492 and Tyr 497 of CDC25B could influence
the interactions between CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin A,
the distance between the two proteins was also calculated.
As is mentioned above, the NH1 of Arg 488 and
NE of Arg 492 of CDC25B formed hydrogen bonds with
the OD1 of Asp 206 of CDK2/Cyclin A and the NH1
of Arg 492 formed one hydrogen bond with the OD2
of Asp 206 and the OH of Tyr 497 of CDC25B formed
one hydrogen bond with the OD1of Asp 210 in CDK2/
Cyclin A. The distances of the 4 hydrogen bonds (Arg
488(N1)-Asp 206(OD1), Arg 492(NE)-Asp 206(OD1),
Arg 492(N1)-Asp 206(OD2) and Tyr 497(OH)-Asp
210(OD1)) was calculated. The Figure 7 and Figure 6
displayed the change of the distances between these four
pair atoms in CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-comp#1 system,
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A-compound 7 system and
CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin A system. In un-bounded system,
the mean distances of the four hydrogen bonds were about
0.31 nm, 0.30 nm, 0.31 nm, 0.29 nm, respectively. When
the inhibitor bound to the receptor, the distances of the
corresponding atom pairs showed higher fluctuation than
un-bonded system. In bounded system, the mean distances
between the four atom pairs in CDC25B:CDK2/Cyclin
A (binding with comp#1) were about 0.51 nm, 0.60 nm,
0.54 nm, 0.45 nm, respectively, whereas, the average
distances for them in the system of CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A (binding with compound 7) were 0.50 nm, 0.73
nm, 0.60 nm Å, 0.49 nm, respectively. Due to the inhibitor
comp#1 or compound 7 bound to CDC25B, they formed
hydrogen bonds with the key residues Arg 488 and Arg
492 and altered their conformations, hence, the distances
of the four atom pairs were changed and made Arg 488,
Arg 492 and Tyr 497 in CDC25B far away from their
paired residues Asp 206 and Asp 210 in CDK2/Cyclin A,

values at about 39.02 μM. Interestingly, MD simulation
and MM/PBSA demonstrated that comp#1 bound to
the catalytic domain of CDC25B disrupt the proteinprotein interaction. In comparison with the existing
inhibitor compound 7, the new inhibitors not only had
better pharmaceutically relevant properties, but also
assumed the conformations more favorable in binding
to CDC25B. Hence, based on these studies, the findings
here may stimulate a new strategy for developing novel
anticancer agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The representative crystal structures of CDC25B
(PDB ID:4WH9) [24] and CDK2/Cyclin A (PDB ID:
5CYI) [30] were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
[31] and used for the following studies.

Protein-protein docking
ZDOCK associated with RDOCK has been
demonstrated as a highly successful method for making
accurate protein-protein docking predictions [32]. ZDOCK
[25] module of Discovery Studio 3.5 which had displayed
great prediction abilities in protein-protein docking was
used to perform CDC25B (PDB ID:4WH9) and the
interacting regulatory protein CDK2/Cyclin A (PDB ID:
5CYI) docking studies. Initially, proteins were prepared by
removing water compounds, adding the hydrogen atoms,
assigning bond orders, adding hydrogen, treating metals,
treating disulfides utilizing the protocol of “prepare
protein” [33, 34]. Then, the key residues Arg 488, Arg
492 and Tyr 497 of CDC25B which was set as “receptor”
were considered as receptor binding site residues and Asp
206 and Asp 210 of CDK2/Cyclin A defined as “ligand”
were known as ligand binding site residues [27, 28]. It
was important to limit the docked surface within the
key residues to avoid irrelevant bound complexes (false
positives). At last, in the docking process, we set an
angular step size to 6°, a root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) cutoff value to 6.0 Å and interface cutoff to
9.0 Å to carry out final conformational sampling. After
docking, 2000 top poses were generated and clustered
with the maximum number of 60. All possible binding
modes between receptor and ligand were ranked based on
shape, desolvation energy, and electrostatics using Fast
Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm [35]. In order to obtain
near-native conformation, the predicted protein poses from
ZDOCK were subjected to refinement and re-ranking
using CHARMm [36] to remove clashes and optimize
polar and charge interactions by RDOCK [26] which
consisted of two-stage energy minimization scheme: (1)
minimization ionic residues in neutral state [26, 37]; (2)
minimization ionic residues at charged state [37]. After
refinement, the predictions are rescored based on the
combination of electrostatics and desolvation terms and

CONCLUSIONS
This research focused on identifying novel and
efficient inhibitors targeting CDC25B and disrupting
the interactions between CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin
A by combination of computational methods including
ZDOCK, RDOCK, replace fragment, ADME, molecular
docking and MD simulations. The most optimized 3D
structure of CDK2/Cyclin A in complex with CDC25B
was constructed by the module of ZDOCK and RDOCK
in Discovery Studio 3.5. Subsequently, new lead
compounds with improved properties were derived using
compound 7 with the help of replace fragment. Then,
12 compounds were discovered by the means of ADME
and CDOCKER. The comp#1, as a representative, was
selected to be synthesized and assayed for their CDC25B
inhibitory activities. The comp#1 exhibited mild
inhibitory activities against human CDC25B with IC50

finally re-ranked. E_RDOCK (Energy RDOCK) [26] was
used as the default scoring function to predict the binding
affinity of the ligand protein to the receptor protein.
Hence, the 5 poses of docked conformations which had
lower E_RDOCK were selected for further analysis.

over 10 million molecules of Drugs-Now database from
ZINC [44] using the module of Discovery Studio called
“Generate fragment libraries”. First, The compound 7,
which was conceived as a lead compound to develop
novel therapeutic agent for treating cancer, was divided
into three parts, A, B and C, as marked by blue line,
red line and green line, respectively (Figure 7). Second,
the three parts of compound 7 were replaced using the
module of “replace fragment” by searching the fragment
database generated earlier. Lund group reported that the
part A formed hydrogen bonds with Phe 386, Leu 398,
Lys 399, Cys 484 and Met 505 through water molecules
and formed a cation-Pi interaction with Arg 488, the part
B was partly solvent exposed and replaced a well-defined
water molecule and the part C formed hydrogen bonds
with Arg 488 and Arg 492 [24]. Based on this, we replaced
part A by searching acidic and aromatic databases to form
hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, while
the purpose of replacing part B and C is to form more
hydrogen binding interactions with Arg 488 and Arg 492
by searching the whole fragment database.

Protein-protein docking validation
In order to avoid false positive results, the validation
of docking module is very important procedure. Two
methods were performed to assess the reliability of the
docking protocol. To start with, the docked structures
of the two proteins CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin A were
superimposed with the crystal CDC25B (PDB ID:4WH9)
and CDK2/Cyclin A (PDB ID: 5CYI), respectively. The
RMSD values between the two structures were both < 3
Å [38], which indicated that the docking method was
reliable. It is reported that Arg 488, Arg 492 and Tyr 497 of
CDC25B had hydrogen bonding interactions with Asp 206
and Asp 210 of CDK2/Cyclin A, respectively. The distance
fluctuated between Arg 488(N1)-Asp 206(OD1) for 0.29 ±
0.02 nm, Arg 492(NE)-Asp 206(OD1) for 0.28 ± 0.02 nm,
0.29 ± 0.02 nm for Arg 492(N1)-Asp 206(OD2) and 0.27
± 0.02 nm for Tyr 497(OH)-Asp 210(OD1), respectively
[27, 28], then, we used it as a standard to verify our model.
The 20 ns MD simulations were performed toward 5 poses
of the two proteins CDC25B and CDK2/Cyclin A. Four
atoms-Arg 488(N1), Arg 492(NE and N1), Tyr 497(OH)
in CDC25B and three atoms-Asp 206(OD1 and OD2),
Asp 210 (OD1) in CDK2/Cyclin A were monitored and
calculated.

ADME prediction
Poor ADME properties cause the failure of many
drug candidates during clinical trials. Thus, it was
important to exclude those none drug-like compounds
before virtual screening. In this study, the means of ADME
embedded in Discovery Studio 3.5 was used to evaluate
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of
selected compounds, including aqueous solubility [45],
human intestinal absorption (HIA) [46, 47], cytochrome
P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) binding [48] and plasma protein
binding properties (PPB) [49, 50]. The compounds
obtained from “replace fragment” were selected based
on the values of 2–4, ≤ 1, False and True for solubility,
absorption, CYP2D6 and PPB, respectively, which might
become promising drugs.

Generation of novel compounds
Fragment replacing was a powerful computational
technique which was always applied to discover new
inhibitors based on a known inhibitor [39, 40]. Before
using this module, high-quality fragment database should
be constructed, including two criterions: 1) good diversity
to represent drug-like chemical space; 2) meeting certain
criteria of physicochemical properties, solubility and
synthetic accessibility [41–43]. The database of potential
substitution fragments was generated by decomposing

to their receptors, was employed to evaluate potential
bioactivity of candidate compounds.
The most optimal structure of CDC25B:CDK2/
Cyclin A singled out from protein-protein docking was
used for docking. Initially protein was prepared by
removing water compounds, adding the hydrogen atoms,
assigning bond orders, adding hydrogen, treating metals,
treating disulfides utilizing the protocol of “prepare
protein” [33, 34]. During the process of CDOCKER,
the 1st step is to calculate receptor conformations
using ChiFlex energy [52]. The 2nd step is to create
ligands conformations. The retrieved compounds were
subjected to “Prepare Ligand” which consists of the
procedures of generating possible states by ionization
at target pH 7.0±2.0, desalting, retaining chiralities
from 3D structure and geometry minimization with
the CHARMm forcefield. The 3rd step is to define the
binding site. Binding sphere for CDK2/Cyclin A-bound
CDC25B (14.585, -8.852, -2.618 and 11.5) was selected
from the active sites using the binding site tool based
on the known ligand pose-compound 7. It is a unique
binding site targeting the CDC25B and CDK interaction
site, primarily including Phe 386, Asp 397, Leu 398,
Lys 399, Cys 484, Arg 485, Arg 488, Arg 492 and Met
505 [24], which is not the traditional binding site (PTP
domain and swimming pool [53]). The 4th step is to
perform ligands docking into the protein active site.
The 5th step is to refine selected protein side-chains in
the presence of the rigid ligand using ChiRotor [52].
The side chains of specified amino acids in CDC25B
(Phe 386, Asp 397, Leu 398, Lys 399, Cys 484, Arg
485, Arg 488, Arg 492 and Met 505) were refined using
ChiRotor algorithm. The 6th step is to perform a final
ligand refinement using CDOCKER [54]. CDOCKER_
ENERGY, as the default scoring function, was applied
to predict the binding affinity of the ligand to the
target receptor. Hence, the structures which had better
CDOCKER_ENERGY than compound7 were selected
for further analysis.

Human recombinant CDC25B was expressed in
E.coli and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography
in our laboratory. The basic chemical reaction catalyzed
by a phosphatase converted a phosphosubstrate into a
dephosphorylated product and free phosphate which
could be measured as a surrogate for phosphatase
activity. pNPP (para-nitrophenyl phosphate) was used
as phosphatase substrate which can be hydrolyzed by
phosphatase to give para-nitrophenol. Subsequently,
para-nitrophenol converted into para-nitrophenolate
(pNP) with addition of sodium hydroxide stop solution.
pNP is an intense yellow compound and could be
measured at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. To
begin with, purified recombinant CDC25B (0.05 μg) in
50 μL buffer with 50 mM citrate (pH 6.0), 0.1 M NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and test
compounds were added to each well of a 96-well plate.
Blank was prepared by omitting enzyme and substituting
an equivalent volume of buffer. After preincubation for
15 min at room temperature, 50 μL of reaction buffer
with 2 mM pNPP was added and incubated at 37 °C for
30 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μL
0.2 M sodium hydroxide and chilled on ice quickly. In
addition, the amount of pNP was measured by detecting
the absorption at 405 nm against blank. Finally, IC50
values were determined by analyzing the data using
ORIGINPRO 8 software.

Molecular dynamic simulation
The “GROMACS 4.5.5 package” was adopted to
study the internal motions of the receptor-ligand system.
The interactions of CDC25B-CDK2/Cyclin A with the best
hit identified from screening of “Replace Fragment” was
investigated through MD simulation using GROMACS
4.5.5 package with GROMACS 43a1 force field [55] for
20 ns. The topology files and charges for the ligand atoms
were generated using the PRODRG 4.5.5 Server [56]. All
the models were simulated by incorporating space-filling
dodecahedron boxes and filled with explicit single-point
charge (SPC) water molecules. The models were covered
with a water shell of 1.0 nm from the surface of the
protein. The system was neutralized and equilibrated with
counter ions to replace SPC water molecules randomly.
Subsequently, the models were minimized using steepest
descent approach and well equilibrated by positionrestrained dynamics simulation, namely NVT and NPT
canonical ensemble (N= number of partical, P= system
pressure, V= volume, and T= temperature). All models
were heated to 300 K during a 100 ps NVT simulation
with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps and equilibrated with
constant pressure of 1 bar in a 100 ps NPT simulation with
a coupling constant of 2 ps using leap-frog integrator. The
temperature and pressure were regulated by V-rescale,

Chemistry
All the reagents were purchased from commercial
suppliers and were used without further purification unless
otherwise indicated. All the reactions were monitored by
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel precoated
F254 Merck plates, and spots were examined under
UV light (254 nm). All column chromatography was
performedusing 200–300 mesh silica gel. 1H NMR and13C
NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker Avance 300-MHz
NMR Spectrometer at 300 K with TMS as the internal
standard, and CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 were used as solvent,
the values of the chemical shifts (δ) were expressed in
parts per million (ppm), and coupling constants (J) were
expressed in hertz (Hz). MS spectra were recorded on an
Agilent 1100 LC/MSD (ESI) Mass Spectrum.

Binding free energies for all complex systems
were calculated by using the molecular mechanics
Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method
[59]. A total of 50 snapshots that were extracted during
equilibrium phase between 10–20 ns were employed for
the calculation, using g_mmpbsa [60] tool of Gromacs.
The binding free energy of protein with ligand system in
solvent was expressed as the following equations [60]:
∆Gbinding = Gcomplex - (Gprotein + Gligand)
Here, Gcomplex, Gprotein and Gligand are the total free
energies of complex, receptor and ligand in solvent
respectively. Furthermore, the free energy for each
individual Gcomplex, Gprotein and Gligand was estimated by:
Gx = EMM - TS + Gsolvation
EMM = Ebonded + Enon-bonded = Ebonded + ( Evdw + Eelec)
Gsolvation = Gpolar + Gnon-polar
Here, x is the protein, ligand or protein-ligand
complex. EMM is the average molecular mechanics
potential energy in vacuum and Gsolvation is free energy
of salvation. T is the temperature and S is the solute
entropy. Ebonded is bonded interactions which are made
up of bond, angle, dihedral and improper interactions
and Enon-bonded is non-bonded interactions including
van der Waals (Evdw) and electrostatic (Eelec)
interactions. ∆Ebonded is always taken as zero [61].
Gpolar and Gnon-polar refer to the electrostatic and nonelectrostatic contributions to the solvation free energy,
respectively.
