Abstract
NF-κB may be a potential therapeutic target for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) because NF-κB activation
is found in primitive human AML blast cells. In this report, we initially discovered that the potent antineoplastic
effect of niclosamide, a Food and Drug Administration–approved antihelminthic agent, was through inhibition of
the NF-κB pathway in AML cells. Niclosamide inhibited the transcription and DNA binding of NF-κB. It blocked
tumor necrosis factor–induced IκBα phosphorylation, translocation of p65, and expression of NF-κB–regulated
genes. Niclosamide inhibited the steps TAK1→IκB kinase (IKK) and IKK→IκBα. Niclosamide also increased the
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AML cells. Quenching ROS by the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine
attenuated niclosamide-induced apoptosis. Our results together suggest that niclosamide inhibited the NF-κB
pathway and increased ROS levels to induce apoptosis in AML cells. On translational study of the efficacy of
niclosamide against AML, niclosamide killed progenitor/stem cells from AML patients but spared those from
normal bone marrow. Niclosamide was synergistic with the frontline chemotherapeutic agents cytarabine, etoposide, and daunorubicin. It potently inhibited the growth of AML cells in vitro and in nude mice. Our results support further investigation of niclosamide in clinical trials of AML patients.

Introduction
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a major type of hematologic malignancy. Chemotherapy remains an important
therapeutic approach. However, in the past 3 decades, limited
progress has been achieved in improving the long-term disease-free survival, except for certain subtypes of AML (e.g.,
acute promyelocytic leukemia). Cytarabine (Ara-C), etoposide
(VP-16), and daunorubicin (DNR) remain frontline agents (1).
Therefore, the development of innovative therapies and identification of more effective drugs for AML has high priority.
Recently, interest has increased in molecularly targeted
therapy for AML. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors [e.g., PKC412 (2) and sorafenib (3)] brought promise for
the subtype of AML patients with activating mutations of

Flt3 [e.g., Flt3 internal tandem duplication (Flt3-ITD)]. However, ∼50% of AML patients have normal karyotypes. Accordingly, the selection of molecular targets for therapeutic
intervention is not obvious for these AML cases.
NF-κB plays a critical role in inflammation, antiapoptotic
responses, and carcinogenesis (4–7). High NF-κB expression
is found in primitive human AML blast cells (8–11). In particular, the constitutive activation of NF-κB exists selectively
in leukemia stem cells but not in normal hematopoietic stem
cells (11). Therefore, NF-κB may be a potential therapeutic
target for the selective eradication of leukemia stem cells.
Indeed, pharmacologic inhibition of NF-κB was effective in
killing AML cells (12, 13).
In this report, we validated the inhibitory action of niclosamide against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–induced NF-κB
activation in AML cells and identified its mechanism, together with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as being
responsible for induced apoptosis of AML cells. We also report on our translational studies showing the synergism of
niclosamide with frontline chemotherapeutic agents for
AML, the presence of a therapeutic window, and the in vivo
antineoplastic efficacy in a mouse model.

Cell Culture
HL-60, U937, OCI-AML3, Molm13, MV4-11, and U266 cells
were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS (Biological Industries). The mitochondrial respiration-deficient ρ−
cells (C6F/HL-60) were established and cultured as described
(14). U2OS cells, mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), and normal human fibroblast (NHFB) cell lines were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (15, 16).
Primary Cells from AML Patients
Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were obtained
from patients with AML (68 cases), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 10 cases), or chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML; 3 cases) and from 7 healthy adult donors in The First
Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, and Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital after patients gave their informed consent. The study
followed institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki principles. The clinical information for the 81 patients
is in Supplementary Table S1.
Preparation of Whole-Cell Lysates and Cytosolic
Fraction
Whole lysates were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (16, 17). The cytosolic fraction was prepared
with digitonin extraction buffer to detect the level of cytochrome c in the cytosol, as described previously (16, 17).
Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fractions
Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (18).
Luciferase Assay
U2OS cells were transfected with reporter plasmids encoding NF-κB–TATA-Luc (0.5 μg) and pEFRenilla-Luc (10 ng) or
together with plasmids encoding the desired genes by use of
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activities were

www.aacrjournals.org

as described (19). NF-κB activities were determined by normalizing the activity of NF-κB–dependent firefly luciferase to
that of Renilla luciferase. The pNF-κB-Luc plasmid was from
Stratagene. The plasmids pCMV5-IKKα, pCMV5-IKKβ,

Immunofluorescence staining was as described previously
(17, 23).
Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability was determined by MTS assay (CellTiter 96
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay, Promega; refs.
15, 16). The drug concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of
cell growth (IC50) was determined.
Flow Cytometry
Measurement of apoptosis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential, as well as analysis of cell cycle and intracellular ROS levels, was as described (16, 17, 24).
Colony-Forming Assays
Soft agar clonogenic assay in AML cell lines. AML cell
lines were treated with niclosamide or diluent (DMSO,
control) for 24 h, then washed with PBS, and seeded in Iscove's medium containing 0.3% agar and 20% FCS in the absence of drug treatment (16).
Colony-forming assay in normal bone marrow cells
and primary AML blast cells. The colony-forming capacity
of normal bone marrow cells and primary AML blast cells
was analyzed by use of methylcellulose medium (Methocult H4434, Stem Cell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Niclosamide was added to the
initial cultures at 0.1 to 10 μmol/L. After 14 d of culture,
the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was evaluated
under an inverted microscope according to the standard
criteria (25).
Tumor Xenograft Experiments
Male nu/nu BALB/c mice were bred at the animal facility
of Sun Yat-sen University. HL-60 cells were inoculated s.c. on
the flanks of 4- to 6-wk-old mice. Tumors were measured every other day with use of calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated by the following formula: a2 × b × 0.4, where a is the
smallest diameter and b is the diameter perpendicular to a.
After mice were euthanized, xenografts were dissected,
weighed, or preserved. All animal studies were approved by
the Sun Yat-sen University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.

underwent flow cytometry after CD34-FITC staining. The rest
of the cells were cultured with or without niclosamide for
24 h. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry after
staining with CD38-PE and Annexin V–FITC. The Annexin

GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software) was used

Results
Niclosamide inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB–dependent reporter gene transcription. We first examined whether niclosamide affected the TNF-induced NF-κB–dependent reporter
gene transcription. U2OS cells were cotransfected with pNFκB–TATA-Luc and pEFRenilla-Luc for 24 hours and then
treated with niclosamide. After stimulation with TNFα, the
luciferase activity increased, but niclosamide inhibited the
TNF-induced NF-κB reporter activity in a dose- and timedependent manner (Fig. 1A).
Niclosamide inhibits NF-κB activation induced by p65,
IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, and TAK1. Cotransfection of p65, IKKα,
IKKβ, IKKγ, or TAK1 constructs markedly increased the luciferase activity of NF-κB–TATA-Luc reporter; niclosamide
significantly abrogated this increase (Fig. 1B). Therefore, niclosamide could block the IKK- or TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. Considering the critical role of TAK1 in TNFinduced activation of IKK (26), and niclosamide inhibiting
TNF-induced IKK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), niclosamide
may exert its inhibitory effect at the TAK1 step (model
in Fig. 4D, right).
Niclosamide inhibits DNA binding of NF-κB. We next determined whether niclosamide affected the binding of NF-κB
to DNA by EMSA. The levels of the NF-κB–DNA complex
were steadily increased on TNFα stimulation (Fig. 1C, left).
The TNF-induced bound complex disappeared when the labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide competed with an excess (200fold) of unlabeled probe (Fig. 1C, left), indicating the binding
specificity of this assay. Pretreatment with niclosamide completely blocked the time- and dose-dependent TNFα-induced
alteration of the NF-κB–DNA complex (Fig. 1C).
Niclosamide inhibits constitutive NF-κB activation. Because constitutive activation of NF-κB exists in certain tumor
cells such as multiple myeloma U266 cells (18), we tested and

found that niclosamide inhibited constitutively active NF-κB
binding to DNA in U266 cells (Fig. 1D).
Niclosamide inhibits TNF-induced degradation of IκBα
and relocation of p65 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Immunoblotting showed that in the absence of niclosamide (Fig. 2A, left, top), the levels of phosphorylated IKKα/β
and phosphorylated IκBα steadily increased in HL-60 cells
beginning at 5 minutes after TNFα stimulation. Concomitantly, the levels of total IκBα progressively decreased, which
was consistent with phosphorylation of IκBα activating ubiquitination and degradation (5). In contrast, niclosamide
completely abolished the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of
IKKα/β and IκBα (Fig. 2A, left, top). Accordingly, the TNFαinduced degradation of IκBα was abrogated by niclosamide.
Conversely, the levels of phosphorylated and total p65 in the
nuclear fractions were increased in TNF-stimulated cells, but
niclosamide abrogated the TNF-induced nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig. 2A, right, top). Similar findings were obtained
in Molm13 cells and primary AML blast cells (Fig. 2A).
Niclosamide abrogating NF-κB activation in HL-60 cells was
dose and time dependent (Fig. 2B). This potent inhibitory
activity was confirmed in 12 of 12 additional AML patients
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The inhibitory effect of niclosamide
on TNF-induced translocation of p65 was further confirmed
by immunofluorescent microscopy (Fig. 2C).
Niclosamide decreases TNF-induced NF-κB–dependent
gene products involved in cell survival. HL-60 cells were
pretreated with or without niclosamide for ∼24 hours and
then stimulated with TNFα; the levels of Bcl-XL, c-myc, survivin, Bcl-2, and cyclin D1 were increased (Fig. 2D, left), and
the TNF-induced upregulation was abolished by niclosamide
(Fig. 2D, right).
Because TNFα activates multiple pathways, we examined
the selective activity of niclosamide. Niclosamide inhibited
the TNF-induced activation of AKT, which is upstream of
TAK1 (27), but not ERK1/2, JNK, or p38 (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
Niclosamide inhibits growth of AML cell lines in vitro.
We evaluated the activity of niclosamide in AML cells by
MTS. Niclosamide dose dependently inhibited the growth
of AML cells within the nanomolar range (Fig. 3A, top).
We also measured the effect of niclosamide on anchorageindependent growth of AML cells in soft agar culture. Niclosamide dose dependently inhibited the number of surviving
clonogenic AML cells, with IC50 values of 69.5 to 95 nmol/L
(Fig. 3A, bottom).
Niclosamide induces apoptosis in AML cells. Niclosamide induced robust apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry
after Annexin V–FITC/PI staining in AML cells (Fig. 3B). It

and mitochondrial potential was analyzed by flow cytometry. Left, representative fluorescent histograms from three independent experiments; right,

Niclosamide Inhibits NF-κB and Increases ROS in AML

induced a dose- and time-dependent specific cleavage of PARP
and a decrease in the precursor form of caspase-3, further indicating onset of apoptosis (Fig. 3B, bottom two panels).
Niclosamide decreases Mcl-1 and XIAP levels and leads
to mitochondrial damage. Niclosamide led to decreased levels of Mcl-1 and XIAP in AML cells (Fig. 3C) and elevated
levels of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fractions and to mitochondrial depolarization in HL-60 cells (Fig. 3D). Therefore,
niclosamide triggered the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
Niclosamide does not affect cell cycling. Niclosamide had
a minimal effect on cell cycling in AML cells, except for the
appearance of the sub-G1 apoptotic population (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Niclosamide generates ROS in AML cells. Niclosamide
was reported to inhibit the NADH→NADP+ transhydrogenation on Hymenolepis diminuta submitochondrial particle assay (28, 29). We therefore assessed whether niclosamide
induced intracellular ROS generation. Niclosamide increased
intracellular ROS levels in HL-60 cells at 2 hours, which
peaked at 8 hours (Fig. 4A).
Niclosamide-induced ROS elevation partially contributes to apoptosis of AML cells. Because ROS generation
is an important mechanism for certain chemotherapeutic
agents to kill tumor cells (30), we next examined whether
the niclosamide-induced ROS elevation facilitated its cytotoxicity in AML cells. Although NAC completely blocked
the niclosamide-induced ROS elevation (Fig. 4B, left, top),
quenching ROS by NAC attenuated but did not completely
abrogate niclosamide-mediated apoptosis, which was reflected by Annexin V–positive cell population and PARP
cleavage (Fig. 4B). Therefore, ROS elevation partially contributed to the cytotoxicity of niclosamide and may be a mechanism parallel to NF-κB inhibition.
ROS elevation and NF-κB inactivation are independent
mechanisms of niclosamide. Redox regulation of NF-κB is
controversial: ROS can activate or inhibit NF-κB (31, 32).
By using the dual activities of niclosamide, we examined
whether TNF-induced NF-κB activation was regulated by
ROS. NAC did not prevent the TNF-induced phosphorylation
or degradation of IκBα or translocation of p65 (Fig. 4C, left,
top). However, in the presence of NAC, niclosamide completely blocked TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and
p65 translocation.
We next addressed whether ROS played a role in TNFinduced NF-κB–dependent reporter gene transcription.
Quenching ROS by NAC did not substantially attenuate the
TNF-induced elevation of NF-κB transcription activity
(Fig. 4C, left, bottom). In the presence of NAC, niclosamide

completely abrogated the TNF-induced elevation of NF-κB
transcription.
The mitochondrial respiration-deficient ρ− cells were used
to further ascertain whether ROS affected the TNFα-induced
NF-κB activation. We hypothesized that ρ− cells generated
less ROS in response to niclosamide treatment because of
their deficient mitochondrial aerobic respiration. After niclosamide treatment, mean intracellular ROS level was increased ∼10-fold in parental HL-60 cells but only 3-fold in
ρ− cells (Fig. 4C, right, top). We next compared the TNFinduced NF-κB activation in this pair of cells. Parental
HL-60 cells and ρ− cells were pretreated with or without
niclosamide, and then TNFα was added in the culture. Immunoblotting revealed that IκBα phosphorylation and p65
translocation occurred to the same extent in parental HL-60
cells as in ρ− cells (Fig. 4C, right, bottom). Therefore, niclosamide inhibited the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in a ROSindependent manner.
Conversely, we determined whether TNF-induced NF-κB
activation affected ROS generation. Because marked repression of NF-κB by niclosamide requires >4 hours of incubation
with niclosamide (Fig. 1A, right), we chose 2-hour niclosamide treatment to induce a significant elevation of ROS with
minimal effect on NF-κB activation. After HL-60 cells were
exposed to 125 nmol/L niclosamide for 1.5 hours, cells were
stimulated with TNFα, and then ROS level was detected.
TNFα did not influence the niclosamide-induced ROS generation (Fig. 4D, left).
Niclosamide is synergistic with Ara-C, VP-16, and DNR.
Because of the high potency of niclosamide in AML cells, we
assessed its effect on normal cells. MEF, NHFB cells, and
bone marrow cells from four healthy individuals were treated
with niclosamide for 72 hours; cell viability assay revealed niclosamide with minimal effects on growth of these normal
cells (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, the differential
sensitivity of niclosamide in AML cells and normal cells implies a therapeutic window for niclosamide.
We next examined a synergism between niclosamide and
the frontline chemotherapeutic agents for AML (e.g., Ara-C,
VP-16, and DNR) in causing growth inhibition. HL-60 and U937
cells were incubated in a serially diluted mixture (at a fixed
ratio) of niclosamide and Ara-C, VP-16, or DNR for 72 hours
and then underwent MTS assay. Synergism was evaluated by
the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay (16). Niclosamide and all three drugs synergistically [i.e., combination
index (CI) < 1] inhibited viability of AML cells (Fig. 5A).
Given that Molm13 cells bearing Flt3-ITD were also sensitive to niclosamide (Fig. 3A), we examined a synergistic effect

between niclosamide and PKC412 and found synergism
(CI < 1) in Molm13 cells (Fig. 5A).
Niclosamide inhibits growth of xenografted AML cells in
nude mice. We next explored the antineoplastic effect of niclosamide using the nude mouse xenograft model. Because
niclosamide has limited solubility, we synthesized water-soluble p-niclosamide (Fig. 5B, top). Fourteen nu/nu BALB/c
mice bearing HL-60 xenografts were randomized to receive
treatment with normal saline (control) or p-niclosamide for
15 days (n = 7 animals each). p-Niclosamide (40 mg/kg/d, i.p.)
potently inhibited the growth of HL-60 tumors (Fig. 5B, bottom, two-tailed Student's t test). Further, immunoblotting of
xenograft tissues from mice revealed a potent inhibitory effect of niclosamide on the NF-κB pathway (Fig. 5C).
Niclosamide induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in
primary AML cells. Our in vitro findings prompted us to
assess the efficacy of niclosamide in primary AML cells.
Niclosamide inhibited the growth of AML primary cells in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, top). The median IC50 value for all 81 leukemia patients (including 68 cases of AML, 10
ALL, and 3 CML) was 129 nmol/L (range, 8.5–718 nmol/L;
Supplementary Table S3). Of 21 cases examined, three primary AML blast cells carrying Flt3-ITD were sensitive to niclo-

samide like those bearing wild-type Flt3 (P = 0.4510, Student's
t test; Fig. 6A, bottom, left). As in AML cell lines, in primary
AML cells, niclosamide showed a synergism with Ara-C, VP16, and DNR (Fig. 6A, bottom, right; Supplementary Table S4).
Niclosamide-treated AML blast cells from patients also showed
significantly increased apoptotic cell death, as measured by
flow cytometry (Fig. 6B).
Niclosamide induces apoptosis in progenitor/stem cells
from AML patients. Because niclosamide could kill AML
blast cells, we investigated whether it was effective in eradicating AML stem cells, which are believed to cause relapse or
disease progression because of their self-renewal and proliferation capability (11, 12). First, we evaluated the effect of
niclosamide on functionally defined myeloid progenitor cells
by methylcellulose colony assay. The colony-forming ability
was strikingly inhibited by niclosamide in a dose-dependent
manner, with an IC50 value of 19.8 nmol/L (n = 6; Fig. 6C,
left). In contrast, with as high as 10 μmol/L niclosamide,
the number of CFU-granulocyte macrophages; burst-forming
unit erythroids; and CFU-granulocytes, erythrocytes,
monocytes/macrophages, and megakaryocytes in normal
bone marrow cells remained ∼75% that of untreated bone
marrow cells (n = 3; Fig. 6C, right).

Next, we examined the effect of niclosamide on phenotypically defined stem cells from AML specimens. The CD34+
population separated from mononuclear cells of AML specimens was exposed to niclosamide for 24 hours and then underwent flow cytometry with Annexin V–FITC and CD38-PE
staining. Niclosamide substantially increased the Annexin V–
positive CD34+CD38− subpopulation from AML primary cells
but exerted minimal effect on those from normal bone marrow (Fig. 6D). Again, the selective activity of niclosamide
against AML cells versus normal bone marrow cells was confirmed in primary patient samples.

Discussion
Niclosamide is a Food and Drug Administration–approved
antihelminthic active against most tapeworms. The mechanisms of its action remained elusive, although it seems to
inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of these
worms (28, 29). Niclosamide has low toxicity in mammals
(oral LD50 in rats, >5,000 mg/kg; ref. 33) and is inexpensive
and readily available. Here, we report on niclosamide as an
antileukemic agent with two independent antineoplastic mechanisms: NF-κB pathway inactivation and ROS generation.
We extended our work to evaluate the efficacy of niclosamide
in AML and found that niclosamide potently inhibited the
growth of AML cells in vitro and in nude mice. Niclosamide
induced apoptosis selectively in AML cell lines, primary
blasts, and primitive progenitor/stem cells of AML patients
but not in nonmalignant cells. Niclosamide is synergistic
with the frontline chemotherapeutic agents Ara-C, VP-16,
and DNR. A single 5-mg/kg oral administration of niclosamide in rats could generate a maximal plasma concentration
of 1.08 μmol/L (34), which is sufficient to kill AML cells, as
extrapolated from our data. Our report is the first to show
that niclosamide is effective in vitro and in vivo against
AML cells, including those with the Flt3 mutations.
Oncogenic mutations (e.g., Flt3) can lead to constitutive
activation of NF-κB (13). However, an Flt3-independent
mechanism of NF-κB activation exists in some AML (13,
35). The serum level of TNFα (a well-known potent activator
of NF-κB) was higher in 198 AML patients than in 48 healthy
volunteers (36). The abnormal microenvironment in AML
bone marrow likely causes deregulated secretion of cytokines
by stromal cells (36). Therefore, inactivation of NF-κB pathway could enhance the killing effect of different chemotherapeutic agents. Indeed, our results reveal that niclosamide

has synergistic effects with conventional therapeutic agents
and PKC412 in AML cells.
Although niclosamide was proposed to kill parasitic helminths by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and disrupting NADH→NADP + transhydrogenation (28, 29), we
discovered that niclosamide causes a striking increase in
ROS in human cancer cells, which at least partially contributes to the onset of apoptosis. We also showed that ROS
elevation and NF-κB inactivation may be independent biological activities of niclosamide. Abrogation of ROS by NAC
or deficient mitochondrial respiration did not prevent niclosamide-induced events in the NF-κB pathway; TNFα-induced
activation of the NF-κB pathway did not affect ROS generation (Fig. 4D).
Notably, p-niclosamide showed potent antineoplastic activity against xenografted tumors in nude mice. Ex vivo treatment with niclosamide was effective against primary AML
cells. Consistent with our findings, during the preparation
of this article, Wang and colleagues (37) reported that niclosamide could kill K562 cells (CML).
Our results show that niclosamide is effective in killing
AML stem cells (CD34+CD38−; Fig. 6D) but has minimal cytotoxicity against progenitor cells in normal bone marrow cells
(Fig. 6C). Niclosamide may represent an important potential
chemotherapeutic agent to effectively eradicate leukemia
stem and progenitor cells while sparing normal hematopoietic
tissue and is therefore worthy of further clinical investigation
in AML.
