Abstract
Experimental data suggest therapeutic advantage from selective disruption of the hypoxia response. We recently found
that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib decreases tumor
carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) expression in colon cancer
patients and herein report a companion laboratory study to
test if this effect was the result of hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF) inhibition. Human cervical (SiHa and Me180) and colon
(RKO) carcinoma cell lines were treated with bortezomib or
the structurally unrelated proteasome inhibitor MG132 in
normoxic and hypoxic conditions in vitro. Two different
in vivo experiments investigated bortezomib effects after
single dose (2 mg/kg, 24 h) or longer exposure in severe
combined immunodeficient mice bearing SiHa xenografts.
Treatment with either drug produced accumulation of HIF-1A
in vitro but strongly inhibited the production of CAIX and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) under hypoxia.
This correlated with more than 10-fold reduction in HIF-1
transcriptional activity under hypoxic conditions. A similar
effect of bortezomib was seen in vivo, using the nitroimidazole
probe EF5 to define regions of tumor hypoxia and a triple
immunofluorescence technique to measure the spatial distributions of HIF-1A and CAIX. Plasma VEGF levels decreased
by f90% during treatment with bortezomib, indicating that
this agent can potently inhibit the hypoxia response in
tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(4):1735–43]

Introduction
The 26S proteasome is involved in the disassembly of proteins
that have been targeted by ubiquitin ligases. In addition to the
disposal of proteins that are defective, due for example to
misfolding, the ubiquitin ligase/proteasomal system plays an active
role in regulating the levels of proteins involved in the control of
cell processes, including the regulation of the cell cycle and several
transcription factors (1). Because the turnover of many of these
proteins in cancers is different from that seen in normal tissues, its
disruption by proteasomal inhibition represents a novel and
potentially effective approach to cancer treatment (2). This is
supported by preclinical data as well as results from early clinical
trials using the selective proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(Velcade, formerly known as PS341), which is currently the only
proteasome inhibitor tested for anticancer effects in humans (3).

Bortezomib has shown activity in several hematologic malignancies and is now approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma
patients. Currently, bortezomib is being tested against lymphoma
and a range of common solid tumors (2, 3).
It is now recognized that clinical trials of novel agents should
include biological markers to determine the drug effects at the
molecular level in addition to standard clinical response end points.
The cellular content of several important proteins is altered during
treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Although it remains
uncertain which of these play a significant role in the anticancer
action, particular attention has been paid to InB, a negative
regulator of the nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) transcription factor that
seems to play a major role in cancer growth as well as resistance to
cytotoxic drugs and radiation. However, there is little direct evidence
to show that suppression of NF-nB activation occurs in cancer
patients treated with bortezomib, and it is important to consider
other potential molecular mechanisms of anticancer effect.
Another important transcription factor that is regulated in a
proteasome-dependent manner is hypoxia-inducible factor-1
(HIF-1). Under aerobic conditions, the HIF-1a subunit undergoes
proline hydroxylation at Pro402 and Pro564 that is recognized by von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL)–dependent ubiquitin ligases and targeted for
proteasomal degradation (4, 5). The proline hydroxylases (PHD) are
suppressed under hypoxia, allowing accumulation of HIF-1a, which
then associates with its dimerization partner HIF-1h to form the
HIF-1 transcription factor. Several transcriptional targets are
activated by HIF-1 that in aggregate promote survival under
hypoxic conditions. These include enzymes involved in glucose
uptake and metabolism, carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) that plays a
role in the buffering of acidic products of glycolysis, erythropoietin,
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; ref. 6).
It has been shown previously that proteasome inhibition results
in the accumulation of HIF-1a in tissue culture under aerobic
conditions, although in at least some experimental systems, this is
not able to form transcriptionally active HIF-1 heterodimers (7, 8).
Nevertheless, because HIF-1 activation promotes cancer cell
survival in regions of tumor hypoxia, we considered that HIF-1a
accumulation during bortezomib treatment might be a useful
biomarker for pharmacodynamic effects in cancer patients. This
was tested in a phase II clinical trial of bortezomib in patients
with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer metastatic to liver,
conducted by the Princess Margaret Hospital Phase II Consortium
and reported elsewhere (9). As part of that trial, patients consented
to image-guided core biopsies from liver metastases at baseline and
after 1 week of treatment with bortezomib. Parallel tissue sections
were stained by immunohistochemistry for HIF-1a and the HIF-1
transcriptional product CAIX, and the extent of staining was
quantified by digital image analysis of the viable tumor tissue.
Unexpectedly, we found a highly significant decrease in the amount
of CAIX expression in relation to HIF-1a as well as an overall
increase in HIF-1a and decrease in CAIX following treatment with

bortezomib, suggesting that in addition to the anticipated increase
in HIF-1a, the production of CAIX in hypoxic regions of colon
cancer was being disrupted by bortezomib. The possibility that
bortezomib was acting to inhibit HIF-1 activity under hypoxic
conditions was therefore tested in a companion laboratory study
that forms the basis of the present report.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. Bortezomib ( formerly known as PS341) was
obtained from Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and
MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Bortezomib used
for tissue culture and MG132 were both dissolved in DMSO, aliquoted, and
stored at 20jC. The antibodies used were against HIF-1a (BD Biosciences,
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), a-tubulin (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA),
h-actin (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA), FIH-1 (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO), p21
(Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA), p53 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), p84 (Genetex, Inc., San Antonio, TX),
and p300 (NH2 terminus; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), whereas 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was from Roche Diagnostics (Manheim,
Germany). Anti-CAIX and anti–Pro564 -HIF-1a antibodies (10, 11) were kind
gifts from Dr. A. Harris (University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom),
whereas anti-EF5 was from Dr. Cameron Koch (University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA). The secondary antibodies for indirect immunofluorescence staining were Cy-3–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and Cy-5–
conjugated antimouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA),
whereas the ones used for Western blots (antimouse and antirabbit IgG
antibodies) were from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, United
Kingdom). Protein G-Sepharose was from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd.
(Oakville, Ontario, Canada).
Cell culture. The human cervical squamous cell carcinoma SiHa and
Me180, colon carcinoma RKO, and prostate carcinoma PC3 cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SiHa was
grown in a-MEM, Me180 in McCoy’s medium, RKO in Ham’s F-12:DMEM
H21 1:1, and PC3 in Ham’s/F-12 medium. All the media for cell culture were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were grown at 37jC
and 5% CO2 in air, unless otherwise specified.
Cell treatment, cellular fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and
immunoblotting. Cells grown at 60% to 70% confluence were treated with
proteasome inhibitors and exposed to normal atmosphere (21% O2, 5% CO2,
balance air) or low (0.2% O2, 5% CO2, balance nitrogen) O2 concentrations
in sealed, humidified chambers (Modular Hypoxia Chambers, BillupsRothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA). After 24 h, the cells were processed to obtain
a total lysate [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 100 mmol/L NaF,
and 10 mmol/L NaP2O7 supplemented with 1 mmol/L Na3VO4 and protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics)] or separate cytoplasmic fraction
[15 min of incubation with Dignam buffer: 10 mmol/L HEPES-NaOH
(pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 0.5 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1% NP40, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4,
protease inhibitor cocktail; spun for 5 min] and nuclear fraction [30 min of
incubation with extraction buffer: 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 422 mmol/L
NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L DTT, 200 Amol/L PMSF, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, protease inhibitor cocktail]. For immunoprecipitation, cleared
lysates were precipitated with anti-FIH antibody and collected on Protein
G-Sepharose. Equivalent amounts of protein (assayed with bicinchoninic
acid protein assay from Pierce PerBio, Rockford, IL) were separated by
7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with the
appropriate antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Detection was conducted using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) or
ECL Plus chemiluminescence kits (Amersham Biosciences).
For the irradiation experiment, whole-cell ionizing radiation using a 137Cs
irradiator (MDS Nordion, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) at 1 Gy/min (room
temperature, aerobic conditions) was done on SiHa cells.

Luciferase assays. The constructs used for cotransfections were kind
gifts from other laboratories: 5 hypoxia response element (HRE)-luciferase
(5 HRE-luc) from Dr. A. Giaccia (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), and
the control plasmid lacking the HREs cytomegalovirus-luciferase (CMV-luc)
from Dr. R. Hill (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The
pcDNA3.1/His/LacZ was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Transfection was done using Fugene 6 (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. On the 2nd day, after cotransfections, cells
were reseeded, and the next day, drug treatment together with exposure to
normoxic or hypoxic conditions began. After 24 h of treatment, cells were
lysed, and the luciferase assay was completed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Dual-Light System, A&B Biosciences, Bedford,
MA). The results were normalized to the values read for h-galactosidase
activity. The luminometer used was Luminoskan Ascent (ThermoLab
Systems, Franklin, MA).
SiHa xenografts. Animal experiments were done in the Animal Facility
of the Princess Margaret Hospital, operated under the guidelines approved
by the Canadian Council for Animal Care. SiHa cell suspension (0.1 mL;
containing approximately 5  105 cells) was injected into the left
gastrocnemius muscle of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.
After f3 weeks, the tumors became readily visible and the tumor + leg
diameter measured between 10 to 11 mm (tumor mass, f0.4 g). The
clinical formulation of bortezomib, made up freshly each day, was used for
these experiments. Two in vivo experiments were done: one to investigate
the acute effect of bortezomib (2 mg/kg i.p. single dose) and another
one to assess the effects of a prolonged treatment (up to three doses of
1.5 mg/kg i.p. every other day). In the first experiment, 8 mice were
randomly assigned to bortezomib or drug vehicle control, whereas in the
second, 20 mice were assigned to four groups: single dose, two doses, and
three doses of bortezomib or three doses for vehicle control. Mice were
killed 24 h after the last treatment, blood samples were obtained by cardiac
puncture, and the tumors were excised. Four hours before killing, the
nitroimidazole hypoxia probe EF5 was injected both i.p. and i.v. Each
tumor was dissected from the surrounding tissues and cut into several
slices: some were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the rest were fixed in
formalin for 24 h and paraffin embedded. The blood was collected in
heparin-coated syringes and centrifuged at low speed, and the supernatant
was frozen at 70jC. The VEGF ELISA assay was done according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). This kit
recognizes both human VEGF165 and VEGF121 and at 50 ng/mL does not
cross-react with mouse VEGF.
Immunofluorescence staining. Serial sections were cut from ornithine
carbamyl transferase–embedded tumor tissue: one of them was stained
with H&E for transmitted light microscopy and used for selecting the
tumoral areas, on which the further image analysis was to be done. The
other sections were multiple labeled for the following: (a) HIF-1a, CAIX, and
EF5 and (b) HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3. Secondary antibodies used alone
were control for nonspecific background. All sections were counterstained
with DAPI 1Ag/mL to outline the nuclear area. Measurements of stained
area were made only in the viable tumor areas excluding necrotic or non
tumoral tissue.
Computerized image analysis. Tissue sections were examined using a
Microcomputer Imaging Device image analysis system (Imaging Research,
Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a Quantix cooled CCD
camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) mounted on an Olympus BX50
epifluorescence microscope. The analysis included the entire viable tumoral
area identified on the slide, using a scanning autostage to create composite
images of individual fields at 20 magnification as described previously
(12). A tumoral map that included only viable tumor was made using the
H&E sections and then carefully adjusted on the composite DAPI images.
The final image analysis was done using in-house developed software
written in IDL 6.1 (Research Systems, Inc., Boulder, CO). For the 12-bit
grayscale images, the threshold was set individually at a brightness level
that best separated the signal from the background. For each marker, we
measured the percentage of positive stained area, based on the threshold
images. Only the part of the image that corresponded to the tumoral map
was analyzed.

Proteasome Inhibitors Impair HIF-1 Function In vivo
Statistical analysis. The in vitro experiments were done at least thrice
and representative results are shown. Statistical analysis was done using
SigmaStat 2.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Differences in protein expression
between in vivo treatment groups was assessed using Student’s t test for
normally distributed data or the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test for
nonnormally distributed data. P < 0.05 was used as the cutoff for statistical
significance.

In vitro Experiments
Effects of proteasome inhibitors on accumulation of HIF-1A
and inhibition of CAIX and VEGF expression during hypoxia.
SiHa and Me180 (cervical carcinoma cell lines) and RKO (colon
carcinoma) were treated for 24 h with bortezomib or the
structurally unrelated proteasome inhibitor MG132 and exposed
during this interval to either normal (21%) or low (0.2%) oxygen
concentrations. Whole lysates were used for Western blotting
(Fig. 1A and B, SiHa; C, Me180; and D, RKO), whereas secreted
VEGF levels were measured in the medium collected from the
SiHa-treated samples (Fig. 1E). Bortezomib and MG132 protected
the HIF-1a subunit from proteasome degradation and, as expected,
the protein accumulated in aerobic as well as in hypoxic
conditions. Concurrently, the expression of CAIX and VEGF, which
is HIF dependent, was suppressed under hypoxia. The increased
expression of HIF-1a under aerobic conditions was not associated
with the expression of CAIX or change in VEGF levels when
compared with the control, suggesting that the function of HIF-1a
was impaired by the proteasome inhibitors, regardless of oxygen
tension.
Proteasome inhibitors negatively affect HRE transcription.
SiHa cervical carcinoma and RKO colon carcinoma cells were
transfected with different luciferase constructs: either one containing five HRE inserts (5 HRE-luc) or one lacking any HRE
sequence (CMV-luc) as a control for the hypoxic response and a
h-galactosidase reporter to normalize the luciferase readings. The
cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors for 24 h while
exposed to either aerobic or hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-induced
HRE binding–dependent transcription for SiHa cells was more than
400-fold higher in untreated cells when compared with normoxia.
As shown in Fig. 1F, in SiHa cells, bortezomib and MG132 inhibited
this in a dose-dependent manner. Because RKO cells were more
sensitive to the drugs, lower concentrations were used to avoid
excessive cellular death; at 50 nmol/L bortezomib, the transcription was almost completely suppressed (Fig. 1G).
Proteasome inhibitors induce nuclear accumulation of
HIF-1A. Several reports using confocal microscopy addressed
previously the cellular localization of HIF-1a during inhibition of
proteasomal degradation, but with conflicting results. Although
some suggested that this type of treatment might affect
transcriptional activity of HIF-1a as the nuclear translocation of
the molecule is impaired (7), others found that, in normoxia, on
addition of MG132, HIF-1a is located within the nucleus, although
with a distinct punctuate pattern (13). In our case, cellular
fractionation of SiHa cells treated with proteasome inhibitors
showed that under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions, HIF-1a is
found predominantly in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Effect of proteasomal inhibition and hypoxia on HIF-1A
interaction with prolyl hydroxylases and FIH-1. Because the
proteasome can also regulate the cellular levels of prolyl
hydroxylases (14), we considered that their accumulation during
treatment with proteasome inhibitors might contribute further to

modifying the hypoxia response. As shown in Fig. 2A, under
normoxic conditions, treatment of SiHa cells with bortezomib
resulted in accumulation of the hydroxylated form of HIF-1a
(at Pro564 ), consistent with the accepted role of the proteasome in
HIF-1a degradation under these conditions (7). However, we also
observed accumulation of hydroxylated HIF-1a at low oxygen
levels that was markedly increased in the presence of proteasome
inhibitors, suggesting the persistence of some PHD activity under
hypoxia.
FIH-1 is another enzyme responsible for HIF-1a hydroxylation
(Asn803 ) and also for subsequent impaired function of HIF, as this
inhibits binding to the transcriptional coactivator p300 (5). To test
if HIF-1a accumulated during proteasome inhibition associated
with FIH-1, we did immunoprecipitation with the respective
antibody on lysates from SiHa cells treated with bortezomib or
MG132 for 24 h under normoxic conditions or 0.2% O2. As shown in
Fig. 2B, both drugs increased the levels of HIF-1a complexed with
FIH-1, and this effect was seen under hypoxic as well as aerobic
conditions.
Previous studies favored cytoplasmic localization for FIH-1 (5),
whereas others reported significant amount in the nucleus (15).
Although we showed the presence of HIF-1a–FIH-1 complex,
because HIF-1a was found mostly in the nucleus, we were
interested in investigating FIH-1 access to its substrate. As shown
in Fig. 2C, FIH-1 was indeed mainly cytoplasmic; however, there
was also a certain nuclear amount. Of interest, exclusively in the
nuclear fraction, we noticed a strong band slightly above 120 kDa.
This was identified using FIH-1 antibodies from two different
sources. Additionally, excessive stabilization of FIH-1 when the
proteasome is inhibited or under hypoxia can be excluded because
the protein level was basically constant regardless the treatment or
oxygen concentrations (Fig. 2D).
Both types of hydroxylases (PHDs and FIH-1) remain active in
low-oxygen conditions as was shown by our results, whereas PHDs
are reported to accumulate when proteasomal degradation is
inhibited (14). Hydroxylation of HIF-1a at Pro564 and Pro402
provides a much higher affinity for VHL, which ensures further
ubiquitination and recruitment of corepressors, whereas hydroxylation at Asn803 impairs the binding of transcription coactivators
(16–18). Thus, we considered that modification of these enzymes
might explain the loss of transcription with bortezomib.
Cobalt is a well-known inhibitor of hydroxylases, and FIH-1 is
reported to be more sensitive than PHDs (19). However, similar to
the effects seen with hypoxia, treatment with the bortezomib and
MG132 inhibited the activation of CAIX when SiHa cells were
treated with 100 Amol/L CoCl2 for 24 h (Fig. 2E).
p53 and HIF-1A during proteasomal inhibition. There is an
important body of literature describing the relationship between
p53 and HIF-1a during hypoxia, mediated or not through Mdm2.
p53 is reported to participate in HIF-1a degradation (20–23) as well
as in inhibition of HIF transcriptional function through competition for the coactivator p300 (22). The cellular levels of p53 are also
adjusted by the proteasome, and treatment with bortezomib or
MG132 resulted in the accumulation of p53 in SiHa and Me180 cells
(Fig. 3A and B). To test if p53 was transcriptionally active following
treatment with proteasome inhibitors, we measured the expression
of p21 following exposure to hypoxia or irradiation and found that
this was not suppressed by bortezomib or MG132 (Fig. 3A and B).
These results suggest that the inhibition of HIF-1 is not simply due
to nonspecific effects of proteasome inhibition on transcription.
Note that both of these cell lines express the E6 papilloma viral

protein that accelerates p53 degradation, and this probably
accounts for the lack of p21 induction by radiation in the absence
of proteasome inhibition (24).
Because p53 accumulates with proteasome inhibitors and
remains functional, consistent with previous reports (24, 25), we
considered that this might affect HIF transcription. We tested this
using PC3, a prostate carcinoma cell line that is p53 null (26). As
shown in Fig. 3C, these cells expressed CAIX under aerobic as well
as hypoxic conditions, and this was suppressed by the proteasome
inhibitors, suggesting that the accumulation of p53 is unlikely to
explain the effects of bortezomib on HIF-1 activity.
Proteasome inhibition decreases p300 binding to HIF-1A
during hypoxia. In hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 transactivation
relies on the recruitment of various coactivators, including p300

that interacts with the HIF-1a COOH terminus to ensure further
binding to DNA and transcriptional activation (5). It has been
reported previously that DNA binding is maintained during
proteasome inhibition (7). To test this, nuclear fractions from SiHa
cells were immunoprecipitated with a p300 antibody directed
against its NH2 terminus and probed with an anti–HIF-1a
antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment with proteasome inhibitors
resulted in decreased binding of HIF-1a to p300 under hypoxia
(Fig. 4A), with no change in the total cellular levels of p300
(Fig. 4B).

xenografts were treated with a single i.p. injection of 2 mg/kg
bortezomib or vehicle control. Four hours before sacrifice, animals
were treated with the nitroimidazole hypoxia probe EF5, and
tumors were harvested at 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5A, HIF-1a and
CAIX were strongly colocalized with EF5 in control tumors.
However, 24 h after bortezomib treatment, there was increased
expression of HIF-1a in EF5-negative tissue and a pronounced
decrease in the level of CAIX in hypoxic regions: similar to the
results seen when SiHa cells were treated with bortezomib and
exposed to hypoxia in vitro (Fig. 1A). The effects on HIF-1a were
analyzed by imaging the entire histologic section, manually
outlining viable tumoral areas, and then obtaining the percentage
of nuclear area (defined by DAPI staining) that was positively
labeled for HIF-1a in EF5-negative or EF5-positive regions. As
shown in Fig. 5B , treatment with bortezomib resulted in
statistically significant increases in HIF-1a levels in both the total
and the EF5-negative tumoral areas (P a = 0.012 and P b = 0.015).
The analysis of CAIX did not take into account DAPI staining

because this is predominantly a surface membrane protein. As
shown in Fig. 5C, bortezomib treatment resulted in highly
significant decreases in CAIX levels in hypoxic regions defined by
EF5 as well as in the HIF-1a–positive and the total viable tumoral
areas (P < 0.001 in all cases).
Activation of caspase-3 by bortezomib in SiHa xenografts.
Because HIF-1–dependent transcription can promote cell survival
in hypoxic conditions (27), we asked if bortezomib treatment might
enhance apoptosis in hypoxic regions of SiHa xenografts. A total
of 20 SCID mice bearing SiHa xenografts were divided into four
groups of five each and treated on alternate days with one, two, or
three doses of 1.5 mg/kg bortezomib or vehicle control. Animals
were injected with EF5 4 h before sacrifice, and the tumors were
harvested 24 h after the last bortezomib treatment. Tissue sections
were stained for EF5, HIF-1a, and cleaved caspase-3. As shown in
Fig. 6, there was an overall increase in the mean percentage
tumoral area of cleaved caspase-3 expression after a single dose of
bortezomib (4.00 F 0.72 SE versus 1.51 F 0.29 SE for control). This

membrane was exposed for 30 s (a) and
then 30 min (b) using ECL Plus; a-tubulin
and HIF-1a reprobing (c ) served as
control. Blots are representative of
triplicate experiments. B, increasing levels
of HIF-1a are complexed with FIH-1 when
SiHa cells are treated with proteasome
inhibitors and exposed to hypoxia,
showing that FIH-1 still binds HIF-1a under
hypoxic conditions. Total lysates were
immunoprecipitated (IP ) with anti–FIH-1
antibody, and the blot was probed with
anti–HIF-1a antibody. Levels of total
HIF-1a and FIH-1 in the cellular lysates
used for immunoprecipitation. These
results are representative of three
independent experiments. C, FIH-1 was
found mainly in the cytoplasm of SiHa
cells, with some nuclear presence and
strong signal from a nuclear band heavier
than 120 kDa. p84 protein was used as
a loading control for the nuclear fraction
and a-tubulin for the cytoplasmic fraction.
These experiments were done at least
thrice. Representative results are shown.
D, FIH-1 levels are not affected by
proteasome inhibition or variation in
oxygen concentration (SiHa). E, SiHa cells

after three doses (Supplementary Fig. S2). Because the tumor size
was not significantly affected by the drug, this effect is most likely
due to the suppressed transcription of the gene.

Discussion
In this report, we show that bortezomib suppresses the
activation of HREs and the production of CAIX and VEGF under
hypoxic growth conditions in vitro , with almost complete
inhibition at the highest dose tested. This effect was seen in
several human epithelial cancer cell lines and also with the
structurally unrelated proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that
it might be a general effect of proteasome inhibition in human
cancers under hypoxic conditions. Similarly, using the extrinsic
nitroimidazole probe EF5 to outline hypoxic microregions of SiHa
cervical carcinoma xenografts, we found accumulation of HIF-1a,
together with a large decrease in CAIX in hypoxic regions following
bortezomib treatment. This effect is consistent with our recent
findings in colon cancer patients treated with bortezomib, where
there was a significant increase in HIF-1a relative to CAIX in
sequential biopsies obtained from liver metastases before and after
1 week of bortezomib (9). Moreover, treatment with bortezomib
resulted in a large decrease in the plasma concentration of human
VEGF in mice bearing SiHa xenografts, further supporting the idea
that this agent is a potent inhibitor of the hypoxic response in solid
tumors.
Rapid degradation of the ubiquitinated HIF-1a is considered the
principal mechanism through which HIF-dependent transcription
is suppressed during normoxia. Because proteasome inhibition
in vitro produced accumulation of HIF-1a, this was expected to
result in the transcription of hypoxia-induced genes, regardless of
oxygen level, rather than the observed inhibition of HIF-1, especially
under hypoxia. Nevertheless, a ‘‘paradoxical’’ effect of bortezomib
on the HIF pathway (28) is already mentioned in the literature, as

Figure 3. A, p53 and p21 accumulated in Me180 cells when treated with
bortezomib and MG132, respectively, and exposed to either normal (21%) or
low (0.2%) oxygen concentrations for 24 h. B, SiHa cells were treated with
proteasome inhibitors and irradiated (10 Gy); 6 h later, the cells were collected
and total lysates were used for Western blotting. C, PC3 prostate carcinoma
cells (p53 / ) were treated with bortezomib and MG132, respectively, and
exposed to either normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h. Total lysates were
used for Western blotting. All these experiments were done at least thrice.

indicates that the drug has an anticancer effect in this model,
although there was no significant effect on tumor volume during
the treatment period used in this experiment. When caspase-3
activation was examined in relation to EF5 staining, a pronounced
increase was seen in the hypoxic regions of control tumors, relative
to the nonhypoxic regions. Significant differences were observed in
the time course of caspase-3 activation following bortezomib
treatment, which reached a peak after the first injection in the
nonhypoxic regions, but only after the second dose in the hypoxic
regions.
Bortezomib suppresses plasma VEGF levels in mice bearing
SiHa xenograft. Plasma levels of human VEGF were measured in
animals treated with 1.5 mg/kg bortezomib, using an ELISA assay.
Mean plasma VEGF in untreated control mice was 130.9 F 31.9
pg/mL SE, and this showed a large decrease 24 h following a single
dose of bortezomib, which persisted with alternate day treatment
8.8 F 3.1 after one dose, 8.7 F 1.2 after two doses, and 16.7 F 9.1

several groups reported an antiangiogenic affect or enhanced
apoptosis following in vivo treatment with bortezomib, alone or in
combination with chemotherapeutic agents (29–31). These observations are in accord with our own findings about VEGF and
caspase-3 expression in the described cervical carcinoma in vivo model.
An increasing number of studies focused recently on HIF-1a
regulation by prolyl hydroxylation. The inhibition of PHDs activity
due to decreased oxygen levels is considered critical for HIF-1a
escaping from proteasome degradation during hypoxia because
the affinity of VHL for the nonhydroxylated HIF-1a is much lower
(32–37). However, this concept seems to need adjustment as an
overall increase in cellular hydroxylase activity has been observed
during hypoxia (38), and there is evidence for the presence of at
least some PHD activities in such conditions (37, 39, 40). This is supported by the hypoxic induction of PHD2 and PHD3 transcription
(33, 38, 41–43) and also by the elegant study of Appelhoff et al. (40)
who showed that it is the abundance of the enzyme that dictates
further the involvement of each PHD in HIF regulation. Recently
described elements, such as Siah1a/2 and OS-9, might contribute
also to this picture. Siah1a/2 are members of the E3 ubiquitin
ligase family, efficient within a large range of O2 concentrations,
which can limit PHD1/PHD3 amounts during hypoxia by mediating
their proteasomal degradation (14). Ubiquitously expressed OS-9
binds to both HIF-1a and PHDs and can further enhance hydroxylases activity (44).

www.aacrjournals.org

Consequently, it was attractive to consider prolyl-hydroxylases
of importance when examining the effect of bortezomib on HIF
activity. Protected from proteasomal degradation, PHDs might
accumulate, particularly during hypoxia when their transcription is
induced, resulting in the higher levels of hydroxylated HIF-1a
shown in Fig. 2A. Hydroxylation at Pro402/Pro564 seems to be an
irreversible process (39, 40) and increases pVHL affinity for HIF-1a
by several orders of magnitude (17, 18, 45). This leads to further
poly-ubiquitination, recruitment of transcriptional corepressors
(histone deacetylases), and impaired HIF function (16).
Although HIF-1a accumulates during hypoxia, additional
regulatory steps are required to fine-tune its activity. FIH-1 (the
inhibiting factor of HIF-1) is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that binds
to the HIF-1a–VHL complex> and controls HIF-1 transactivation by
obstructing the recruitment of CBP/p300 coactivators (16, 36, 46).
Of interest, FIH-1 is functionally active in both aerobic and hypoxic
conditions (16, 47), consistent with the coprecipitation data
shown in Fig. 2B. Our data indicate also that PHDs activity and
the binding of FIH-1 to HIF-1a are maintained in the presence of
bortezomib, regardless of the oxygen concentration, whereas, in
contrast with PHDs accumulation during proteasome inhibition
(14), FIH-1 levels are not modified (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the
effects of proteasome inhibition on HIF function were similar in
hypoxia and when HIF-1a was induced using cobalt. Because
cobalt mimics hypoxia by inhibiting both PHDs and FIH-1 (19), we

conclude from these results that PHD and FIH-1 activity is not
essential for the suppression of HIF-1 by proteasome inhibitors.
Moreover, because increased binding of HIF-1a to VHL in the
absence of hydroxylation is unlikely, it cannot explain the
treatment effect.
We next investigated effects of bortezomib on p53 function
because this is regulated also by proteasomal degradation and can
interfere with HIF-1–driven transcription. However, in PC3 p53 /
prostate cancer cells, we obtained similar inhibition of HIF-1 by
bortezomib as in the other cell lines (Fig. 3). Furthermore, although
bortezomib induced its accumulation in SiHa and Me180 cells, p53
remained functional as shown by p21 induction by hypoxia or
irradiation. Thus, we conclude that the effect on HIF-1a is
independent of the p53 status and, in contrast with a previous
report (7), it cannot be explained by nonselective suppression of
transcription by proteasome inhibitors.
Demidenko et al. (48) described a self-limiting mechanism
whereby HIF-1a transcriptionally induces its own degradation
during hypoxia. Consequently, transcription inhibition at low
oxygen levels leads to a ‘‘super induction’’ of HIF-1a that could
explain the more increased accumulation of HIF-1a protein in
hypoxia versus normoxia following bortezomib treatment. These
reports, as well as our own data, reemphasize the differential
regulation of HIF-1a in hypoxia versus normoxia. Aside from the
HIF-1 transcriptional self-limiting loop, p53, and PHDs, other
molecules were found to alter HIF-1a, also only at specific times

and to a certain extent. For example, normal oxygen concentrations are optimal for ARD1, critical for HIF-1a binding by VHL
(47), whereas a hypoxic environment ensures the activity of
thioredoxin, which contributes to HIF-1 transactivation together
with Ref-1 (49).
At the present time, the mechanism by which proteasome
inhibitors suppress the response to hypoxia remains unclear. Based
on our results, we can conclude that this is a specific effect toward
HIF-1a and exclude prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases as well as
p53 as determinant factors. Nevertheless, alterations involving
other molecules that interact with HIF-1a, whether they are
positive or negative regulators, or conformational modifications of
HIF-1a molecule itself, could lead to this outcome, as we were able
to show lower binding of the p300 transcriptional coactivator. It
should be noted that shortly after this article was submitted, Kaluz
et al. (50) also reported that bortezomib disrupts the transcriptional activity of HIF-1a via specific effects on the COOH-terminal
activation domain and that this effect was relieved by overexpressing p300. Unlike our findings, these authors were not able to
show decreased p300 binding following proteasome inhibition.
However, because our own immunoprecipitation data (Fig. 4A)
show only partial loss of HIF-1a binding, which might be explained
by differences in experimental technique, we would agree with
Kaluz et al. that the direct inhibition of p300 interaction is not
sufficient to explain the profound loss of HIF-1a transcriptional
activity under proteosome inhibition.
Tumor hypoxia is an adverse prognostic feature in human
cancers, and hypoxic tumors are less sensitive to cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation. Experimental
results suggest that agents targeting HIF-1 might be selectively
toxic to hypoxic tumor tissue and therefore enhance the effects of
conventional therapy. Together with the recent article by Kaluz
et al. (50), we believe that the results shown here provide a
mechanistic explanation for our earlier empirical finding that
bortezomib treatment disrupts the hypoxia response in the liver
metastases of colorectal cancer patients (9). Further investigation
of an anti–HIF-1 role for bortezomib, and probably other
proteasome inhibitors, should include preclinical testing of
combinations with radiation treatment and additional pharmacodynamic measurements, such as plasma VEGF levels, aimed to
detect HIF-1 inhibition effects in human clinical trials.
