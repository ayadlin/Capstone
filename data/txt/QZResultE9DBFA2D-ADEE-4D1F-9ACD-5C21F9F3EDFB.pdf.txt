Abstract
Glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive adult
brain tumor, is characterized by extreme phenotypic diversity
and treatment failure. Through ﬂuorescence-guided resection,
we identiﬁed ﬂuorescent tissue in the sub-ependymal zone
(SEZ) of patients with glioblastoma. Histologic analysis and
genomic characterization revealed that the SEZ harbors
malignant cells with tumor-initiating capacity, analogous to

cells isolated from the ﬂuorescent tumor mass (T). We
observed resistance to supramaximal chemotherapy doses
along with differential patterns of drug response between
T and SEZ in the same tumor. Our results reveal novel insights
into glioblastoma growth dynamics, with implications
for understanding and limiting treatment resistance. Cancer

Introduction

prognostic signiﬁcance (5, 6). However, emerging data on genomic intratumor heterogeneity in glioblastoma indicate spatial
segregation of genetically distinct clones in the same tumor
(7), making the interpretation of single-sample tumor data challenging. Importantly, this may contribute to the pervasive failure
of treatment in patients with glioblastoma.
Clinical trials have established that use of a ﬂuorescence biomarker, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), can enhance the surgical
resection of glioblastoma (8). We have demonstrated the use of 5ALA in a ﬂuorescence-guided multiple sampling (FGMS) strategy
that permits real-time spatially segregated tumor sampling during
surgery (7, 9). Combining visible ﬂuorescence with neuroanatomy allows for the objective distinction of the tumor mass T
(visible ﬂuorescent). Importantly, a spatially distinct and visibly
ﬂuorescent sub-ependymal zone (SEZ) can also be identiﬁed in a
subset of patients with glioblastoma.
Here, we report an integrated genomic analysis of SEZ and T
samples, obtained by FGMS, which reveals that malignant cells in
the SEZ contribute to tumor growth. Functional characterization
conﬁrms that the SEZ contains tumor-initiating cells (TIC) that
can recapitulate the disease in orthotopic patient-derived xenogeneic models in a manner similar to TICs isolated from the
corresponding T. TICs in the SEZ contribute to resistance to
chemotherapy and show differential patterns of response when
compared with T of the same patients.

The basis of phenotypic diversity and treatment failure in
human glioblastoma is poorly understood. Murine models of
gliomagenesis point to sub-ependymal neural stem cells (NSC) as
a putative cell of origin for astrocytic tumors. The stepwise
premalignant loss of tumor suppressors p53, NF1, and PTEN
(1, 2) has been shown to lead to the development of an aggressive
disease characterized by resistance to genotoxic injury (3).
In addition, stratifying patients using transcriptional proﬁles
derived from a large cohort of glioblastoma single-tumor samples
(4) has identiﬁed multiple disease subtypes, which may have

The SEZ Is a Reservoir of Tumor Cells in Human Glioblastoma

Procedure for details on 5-ALA administration and sample
collection.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from T and SEZ tissues using TRIzol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA
was treated with DNase (Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized from
5 mg of total RNA using Random Primers (Invitrogen), and a
Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System for real-time PCR
(RT-PCR; Invitrogen). The RT-PCR for Nestin, Gfap, Sox2, and
MIB1 transcripts was performed using CFX96 RT-PCR (Bio-Rad),
RT2 qPCR Primer Assay and SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. 18S was used as the
housekeeping reference. Relative expression quantiﬁcation was
performed by the DDCt method. Experiments were performed in
triplicate and each experiment was repeated three times.
Cell line derivation and implantation
Cell cultures from T and SEZ of 42 patients were established
from patients with glioblastoma undergoing surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, in 2010 to 2012. The cells were
isolated as described previously (9, 11, 12) and used either
uncultured (primary) or propagated in vitro for two passages
(brieﬂy cultured) in serum-free medium. The U87 cell line was
obtained from the ATCC, cultured according to the supplier's
recommendations and used just after resuscitation. Tissue collection to establish HFNSCs was approved by the Local Regional
Ethics Committee. Cells were established in 2011 and grown in
serum-free medium to form neurospheres and used at early
passage. All the cell cultures have been tested for Mycoplasma
contamination by PCR before use. See Supplementary Experimental Procedure for details on cell propagation, immunoﬂuorescence, and in vivo experiments.
DNA and RNA extraction
DNA from T and SEZ tissues of 14 patients with glioblastoma
was extracted for copy-number analysis using the DNeasy Blood
and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). RNA from T and SEZ tissues of 15
patients with glioblastoma was extracted for gene-expression
analysis using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and cleaned up using MiniElute
columns (Qiagen). See Supplementary Experimental Procedure
for details on copy-number and gene-expression analysis. Copynumber results were validated by FISH as described in the Supplementary Experimental Procedure.
Drug treatment assay
Treatment with temozolomide, cisplatin, and cediranib was
evaluated using the in vitro BrdUrd cell proliferation assay (Millipore). A total of 3  103 cells were plated in triplicate per treatment
condition. Control wells for temozolomide, cisplatin, and cediranib are shared as these treatments have been applied in the same
experiments. One day after plating, the treatment was applied for
3 days. BrdUrd was applied in the ﬁnal 24 hours of the treatment.
Each experiment was repeated three times. See Supplementary
Experimental Procedure for details on drug concentration.
MGMT promoter methylation
Analysis of MGMT promoter methylation was performed by
PCR (13) and by pyrosequencing (14). In brief, DNA was bisulﬁte
converted and subsequently subjected to PCRs using speciﬁc
primer pairs for the methylated or the modiﬁed unmethylated

www.aacrjournals.org

DNA. PCR products were resolved in a 2% agarose gel stained with
SybrSafe. See Supplementary Experimental Procedure for further
details.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
Multiple spatially separated samples taken from each glioblastoma were collected to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship
between the tumor and the SEZ using copy number proﬁles and
molecular clock analysis. See Supplementary Experimental Procedure for further details.
Statistical analysis
For in vivo experiments using Nod/Scid animals, we performed
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis using the log-rank test for hypothesis testing.
For drug response analysis using BrdUrd, a one-way ANOVA
was performed for each patient.
The P values for the pairwise mean comparisons of each
treatment with the corresponding control were calculated using
the Tukey Honestly Signiﬁcant Difference test. In the related
ﬁgures and for each patient, we plotted the normalized mean
treatment response using the corresponding mean control as a
reference, except in Supplementary Fig. S12, where we normalized
to the mean of the 50 mmol/L temozolomide treatment response.
The minimum and maximum normalized values are provided to
present the dispersion of the normalized data.

Results
SEZ harbors residual disease in patients with glioblastoma
We screened 65 patients with glioblastoma given 5-ALA, and
conﬁrmed that visibly ﬂuorescent disease extended to the SEZ
in 65% (42/65) of the cases. Multiple samples were obtained
from 14 patients. Histologic features of high-grade glioma (15)
were detected in SEZ and T of the patients (Fig. 1A; additional
two representative glioblastomas are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B). SEZ tissue was also used to identify the
ependymal layer and conﬁrm correct sampling (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
Glioblastoma has been shown to heterogeneously express glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (Gfap; ref. 16), and consistent with this,
we noted high expression of Gfap in SEZ samples compared with
matched T samples (Fig. 1B and C top, and Supplementary Fig.
S1C). Expression of the precursor marker Nestin was detected
both in T and SEZ tissues (Fig. 1B and C middle, and Supplementary Fig. S1C). The SEZ showed increased vascularization in
comparison with T, as determined by CD31 expression (Fig. 1B
and C, bottom). Weak expression of the neuronal marker Tuj1 was
observed in both areas (Supplementary Fig. S1C). One of the
histologic hallmarks of glioblastoma is a high proliferative activity
(17), and we observed similar numbers of mitotic cells in T and
SEZ (MIB1 index 20.5  2.8 and 18.1  1.9, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S1C). The extent of focal necrosis was similar in T
and SEZ of the same patients (except for sp40; Supplementary
Table S1). Consistent with immunohistochemical analysis, T and
SEZ contained similar amounts of tumor tissue (except for sp54;
Supplementary Table S1). Together, these data suggest that regulatory mechanisms promoting proliferation and vascularization
are common to the T and the SEZ tissues.
To conﬁrm these ﬁndings, we performed real-time analysis of
gene expression for markers of glial and precursors cells (Gfap and

Nestin), stem cells (Sox2), proliferation (MIB1) on T and SEZ
tissues of three glioblastomas in total (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Our results show increased expression of Gfap in the SEZ compared with the corresponding T (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
expression of Nestin and Sox2 is similar between T and SEZ, except
in sp10 for Sox2 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We applied high-throughput genomic proﬁling techniques to
the SEZ and T to characterize each of these regions. DNA/RNA were
extracted from the tissues of the 14 patients (Supplementary Table
S2A). After quality assessment, we analyzed copy-number aberrations (CNA) of 8 patients and gene-expression proﬁles of 9 patients
(6 of whom were common to both analyses; Supplementary Table
S2B shows the patient clinical information). Our data reveal
multiple aberrations (e.g., EGFR ampliﬁcation and CDKN2A deletions) common to T and the corresponding SEZ in individual
patients (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4). In 6 of 8 patients, the
SEZ had an equal or smaller number of putative driver aberrations
with respect to the corresponding T (mean difference in the
number of aberrations is 1.27  0.38; P value ¼ 0.12). CNA results
were validated by FISH for three glioblastoma drivers, EGFR, MET,
and PTEN (4), in 3 patients with available tissue (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5H). Because we observed in vitro aberrations in the corresponding cell cultures (Supplementary Fig. S6),
we restricted further genomic analysis to tissue samples.
Clustering of the gene-expression data (18) revealed that only
three of nine paired samples (SEZ and T from the same patient)
clustered tightly together, whereas ﬁve of nine SEZ were assigned
to the same subcluster, suggesting a SEZ-speciﬁc expression proﬁle
across patients (Fig. 2C).
We used a previously published classiﬁer to assign our samples
into one of four glioblastoma subtypes (6). Seven of nine SEZ
were classiﬁed as mesenchymal (sp41, sp42, sp52, sp54, sp56,
sp57, and r4), and the remaining two were classical (sp49 and
sp55). For 6 of 9 patients, the SEZ was assigned to a different
subtype than the corresponding T. T samples were distributed

196 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

amongst the four subtypes (classical, mesenchymal, neural, and
proneural; Fig. 2D).
We next investigated whether gene-expression levels differed
between SEZ and T. We rejected the hypotheses of no signiﬁcant
differences in the expression levels of all genes between SEZ and T
(P value < 0.00001), which suggests that there are differentially
expressed genes in SEZ and T. We next used the R package HDTD
to identify gene ontology (GO) terms whose genes are differentially expressed (Supplementary Table S3).
TICs reside in the SEZ
We next extended the characterization of T and SEZ to TIC
populations. In neuroepithelial malignancies, the puriﬁcation of
TICs remains challenging because no robust cell-surface marker
has been identiﬁed to distinguish tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells (19, 20). Initial data identifying CD133/Prominin1 as a
marker in human glioblastoma (21) were subsequently challenged both in primary and cultured TICs (reviewed in ref. 19).
More recently, the cell surface marker CD15/SSEA-1 has been
identiﬁed as a possible TIC marker in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma (22, 23). CD15 is a carbohydrate moiety expressed by
neural stem and progenitor cells (24), but its use as glioblastoma
marker did not ﬁnd additional conﬁrmation (25).
We therefore used a marker-independent approach (9, 11,
12, 26) to isolate cells from T and SEZ under serum-free conditions
in vitro (Fig. 3A). Growth curve analysis and limiting-dilution assays
conﬁrmed long-term self-renewal and expansion (Fig. 3B and
Supplementary Fig. S7), clonogenicity, and multipotency similar
to the corresponding T cells (Supplementary Fig. S8).
We evaluated the expression of the precursor marker Nestin and
other putative TIC markers (A2B5, CD133, and CD15) from T and
SEZ (reviewed in ref. 19) and found similar expression of Nestin
in T and SEZ cells, in agreement with the data in Fig. 1B and C. In
contrast, A2B5-, CD133-, and CD15-positive cells were rarely
found (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B).

The SEZ Is a Reservoir of Tumor Cells in Human Glioblastoma

Figure 2.
The SEZ harbors residual disease. A, summary of the most common putative drivers in glioblastoma. In 6 of 8 patients, the SEZ contains an equal or smaller number of
aberrations with respect to its corresponding T. Cultured cells from T and SEZ of patient sp14 have been used for comparison with the corresponding tissues.
B, FISH of 3 patients conﬁrmed gain of the region of chromosome 7, including EGFR and the centromere (centr 7), in sp49 and sp58 (T and SEZ in both cases), and gain
of the region, including MET and centr 7, in sp58 and cells from sp14 (T and SEZ in both cases); as expected, based on copy-number data, gain of MET
was not observed in sp49T. Orange, EGFR or MET; and green, the centr 7. The single nuclei are representative of what was generally observed in each sample.
C, clustering of gene-expression proﬁles from 9 patients revealed that ﬁve SEZ samples cluster tightly together instead of with their matched T. Samples are
color-coded on the basis of their origin. D, each compartment of 9 glioblastomas has been assigned to a previously described classiﬁer (6): T samples are either
proneural, classical, mesenchymal, or neural, and 7/9 SEZ are mesenchymal.

Despite phenotypic differences in vitro, orthotopic inoculation
of T and SEZ cells in NOD/SCID mice consistently generated
tumors in all cases (Fig. 3C and D and Supplementary Fig. S10).
Nonetheless, a statistically signiﬁcant shorter survival was
observed for animals injected with T cells compared with those
injected with SEZ cells (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S10; P
value < 0.05).
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that SEZ cells from
patients with glioblastoma have been tested for their tumorigenic
potential. We analyzed the in vivo properties of enriched SEZ cells
from three additional glioblastomas. In all cases, SEZ cells gave
rise to tumors with similar patterns of growth and inﬁltration to
those generated from TICs isolated from T, under the same
experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig. S11A–S11C).
TICs from the SEZ contribute to drug resistance
The SEZ and T contained self-renewing TICs suitable for chemoresponse assays. These cells are grown in conditions that better

www.aacrjournals.org

preserve the genotype of the original disease (27) and have been
proposed for use in high-throughput drug screening (28, 29). We
tested the effects of the oral alkylating agent temozolomide, the
current standard of care in patients with glioblastoma (30). To
facilitate analysis, we assayed methylation in the promoter region
of MGMT, a methyltransferase that inhibits the cytotoxic effect of
temozolomide and is a predictive biomarker in glioblastoma (31).
We initially treated TICs isolated from T and SEZ of 7 patients
with glioblastoma with temozolomide at maximum concentrations reported for the brain and plasma (50 mmol/L; refs. 32, 33),
but no signiﬁcant treatment response was observed relative to the
corresponding controls (vehicle only). Only sp12 showed a
signiﬁcant response in both T and SEZ (Supplementary
Fig. S12). We therefore analyzed a set of TICs isolated from T of
20 patients using a dose-escalation strategy ranging from 50
mmol/L to 2.5 mmol/L of temozolomide, and found that only
20% of the samples exhibited a signiﬁcant response at 500
mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S13A and S13B).

between the survival of animals injected with T cells versus those injected with SEZ cells. Bottom, table summarizing the number of tumors/injections and the
type of cells used (primary or brieﬂy cultured). D, hematoxylin and eosin staining of T and SEZ cells derived xenografts; scale bar, 30 mm.

On the basis of these results, we performed cell proliferation
assays for temozolomide concentrations between 50 mmol/L
and 2.5 mmol/L on TICs isolated from T and SEZ of the
same tumor for 8 patients. We noted that TICs continued to
proliferate in the SEZ and T at supramaximal drug concentrations. We also observed that the response varied between T and
SEZ of the same glioblastoma (Fig. 4A and Supplementary
Fig. S14A). Three patterns emerged: differential response
between T and SEZ (e.g., sp13, sp20, sp37, and sp42), both T
and SEZ respond (e.g., sp17 and sp23), neither T nor SEZ
respond (e.g., sp14, except at 2.5 mmol/L temozolomide for
T, and sp52).
To test whether resistance to temozolomide was MGMT-dependent, we analyzed the DNA methylation status of the MGMT
promoter by pyrosequencing (Supplementary Table S4) and
methylation-speciﬁc PCR (Supplementary Fig. S15; ref. 13), and
we found that the results were in agreement except for sp42.
Our PCR analysis revealed that four of seven paired TICs (sp14,
sp23, sp37, and sp52) did not show methylation of the MGMT
promoter in either the T or the SEZ consistent with the poor
response to temozolomide, except for sp23 (T and SEZ) and
sp37T. In contrast, sp17, sp20, and sp42 are methylated
and showed a better response to temozolomide among all the
tested TICs with the exception of sp20SEZ and sp42T (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. S14A). All together, our results suggest that
MGMT methylation status is homogeneous in T and SEZ of the
same patients and generally predicts response to temozolomide
(Supplementary Table S5).

198 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

We also evaluated the antimitotic agent cisplatin, previously
used in glioblastoma therapy, and cediranib, an antiangiogenic
inhibitor of VEGFRs with additional activity against PDGFRs,
recently used in clinical trials (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig.
S14B; refs. 34, 35). Although antiangiogenic therapies target the
endothelial compartment, it has been reported that VEGFRs are
enriched on the surface of TICs from glioblastoma (36). VEGF
signals via its endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (VEGFR2;
ref. 35), so we ﬁrst conﬁrmed that this receptor is expressed in
TICs from T and SEZ (Supplementary Fig. S16). We next
quantiﬁed the expression of VEGF and PDGF receptors. No
signiﬁcant difference was present between T and SEZ (no
VEGFR1 nor VEGFR3 probe was available in the Illumina
arrays; Supplementary Table S6).
Exposure to cisplatin and cediranib revealed resistant TICs in T
and SEZ together with a heterogeneous response proﬁle (Fig. 4B
and Supplementary Fig. S14B). Whereas sp17 and sp23 showed
sensitivity to these treatments in T and SEZ, a signiﬁcant response
was observed only in one of the two regions for sp13, sp20, and
sp52 (Fig. 4B).
The drug response proﬁle of TICs from T and SEZ of the
same patients emphasizes their potential utility in drug development compared with standard glioma cell lines, for example, U87 and human fetal NSCs (HFNSC). U87 signiﬁcantly
responded to treatment with temozolomide, cisplatin, and
cediranib, whereas two HFNSCs lines (HFNSC and HFNSC1)
were resistant to temozolomide, as previously reported (37),
and to cisplatin and cediranib (Supplementary Fig. S17).

Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests different patterns of
glioblastoma evolution involving SEZ malignant cells
Our genomic and chemoresponse assays data show that the
SEZ harbors malignant cells that contribute to tumor growth and
murine models of glioblastoma indicate that the SEZ is enriched
for tumor ancestors (2, 38–40). However, this has not been
conﬁrmed in patients with glioblastoma. We analyzed SEZ and
T samples to determine whether tumor cells grow out of the SEZ or
into the SEZ. We reconstructed tumor ancestral trees in 8 patients,
using several genomic measurements derived from multiple spatially separated samples taken from the glioblastoma mass (T1–
T6) and SEZ. We have previously used this approach to describe
intratumor heterogeneity in T and infer tumor evolution (7), and
we now used FGMS to position the SEZ. In particular, we reconstructed phylogeny based on genome-wide DNA copy number
(41). In an independent assay, we exploited the observation that

www.aacrjournals.org

cells record their ancestral history in the form of neutral DNA
methylation patterns (42, 43). This analysis is not biased by the
presence of non-neoplastic cells, as only highly proliferative
tissues accumulate sufﬁcient methylation events (tumors and
colonic epithelium; Fig. 5A; ref. 44). We ﬁrst validated the molecular clock loci chosen for this analysis (Fig. 5B and C, top) and
then calculated the normal cell content in SEZ and T. The values of
cellularity indicate no signiﬁcant difference (Fig. 5B and C,
bottom).
These orthogonal techniques yielded highly concordant
phylogenies: in sp52, sp54, sp56, and sp57, the SEZ harbors
tumor precursor cells that gave rise to the glioblastoma mass
(Fig. 5D). In sp42 and sp49, we observed a similar trend,
although the two methods are not in full agreement (Fig. 5D).
Analysis of sp55 and sp58 suggests a different pattern of
evolution and emphasizes the heterogeneous nature of

Figure 5.
Phylogenetic reconstruction reveals different patterns of tumor evolution involving SEZ malignant cells. A, cartoon illustrating the phylogeny based on molecular
clock analysis. Non-dividing tissues, such as heart and brain, do not undergo mitotic events and do not accumulate methylation errors. Epithelial tissues,
such as colon, show increased methylation with age due to the mitotic turnover of cells maintaining tissue homeostasis. Tumors undergo a large number of divisions
and accumulate methylation changes in a manner proportional to the number of mitotic events. B and C, top, the IRX2 locus on chromosome 5 in B and the
NETO1 locus on chromosome 18 in C have been validated as molecular clock loci by verifying that age-related methylation increases as a result of cell division in
patient-derived tissues by comparing heart, brain, and colon. Bottom, the graphs show tumor cellularity using IRX2 in B and NETO1 in C molecular clock
data. The values of cellularity indicate no signiﬁcant difference between T and SEZ. D, tumor phylogenies based on SEZ and multiple tumor mass samples (T, T1–T6)
were reconstructed independently with two methods: copy-number breakpoints (a) and two molecular clock loci [IRX2 (b) and NETO1 (c)]. As an example, in sp52,
the SEZ (blue) harbors cells that arise earlier than tumor mass cells (red; sample T1 failed hybridization); NA, not available.

glioblastoma (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data suggest that
the SEZ contains a reservoir of malignant cells that are either
tumor precursor clones or clones generated during glioblastoma evolution.

Discussion
Our comprehensive phenotypic, genomic, and functional
analysis reveals residual disease in the SEZ of patients with
glioblastoma (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
TICs are present in T and SEZ of the same glioblastomas (Fig.
3C and Supplementary Fig. S10) and show differential patterns
of therapeutic responsiveness and drug resistance (Fig. 4A and B
and Supplementary Fig. S14A and S14B), suggesting that the
SEZ should be considered as a novel potential therapeutic
target in a subset of patients with glioblastoma. This is conﬁrmed by phylogenetic reconstruction showing different patterns of tumor evolution with the SEZ harboring precursor
clones or clones generated during the glioblastoma growth
(Fig. 5D).
Gene-expression proﬁling of SEZ reveals that different glioblastoma subtypes (6) are present within the same patient. The SEZ is
predominantly mesenchymal (7 patients) or classical (2 patients).
T is more diverse, with representation from all four subtypes (Fig.
2D). Thus, it is possible to envisage a spectrum of expression
patterns with mesenchymal/classical representing proliferative
diversiﬁcation at the tumor core.

Previous reports suggested that proximity to the SEZ predicts a
multifocal tumor phenotype and recurrences that arise at locations distant from the initial lesion (45). More recently, it has also
been reported that contact of the tumor mass with the SEZ
correlates with shorter survival (46). To explore this, we isolated
TICs from T and SEZ of the same patients. TICs have been
described in human glioblastoma but no analysis based on FGMS
has been performed. Our results show that in vivo both T- and SEZderived cells generated tumors; however, cells from T are more
tumorigenic in comparison with the SEZ in agreement with the
CNAs of the patient samples showing a trend toward a smaller
number of aberrations in the SEZ. These data suggest that the
tumorigenic potential is exacerbated when increased genetic
alterations are acquired by the cancer genome in line with previous reports (47, 48).
Because genomic and phenotypic analyses suggest that the
SEZ harbors tumor cells, it is crucial to investigate whether
there are differences in response to therapy in cells isolated
from this region. It has been previously shown that patientderived TICs accurately represent parent disease (27) and have
potential application in high-throughput drug screening (28,
29). Our data reveal that TICs from T and SEZ of the same
glioblastomas show different patterns of response to therapies
that represent the current standard of care (Fig. 4A and B,
Supplementary Fig. S14A and S14B and Supplementary Table
S5). This suggests that they should be targeted using different
approaches. Our results also reveal that a clinically signiﬁcant

The SEZ Is a Reservoir of Tumor Cells in Human Glioblastoma

fraction of cells is resistant to current treatments. This is
consistent with murine data (3), indicating that multimodal
stratiﬁed approaches will be essential to improve therapeutic
responsiveness.
Glioblastoma evolves by following poorly understood spatial
and temporal dynamics arising from cells of origin that are yet to
be deﬁned. The presence of malignant cells in the SEZ suggests two
different scenarios of evolution with the glioblastoma growing
into the SEZ or out of this region. Our phylogenetic data indicate
that in 4 of 8 patients, a pool of malignant precursor clones
evolved in the SEZ (Fig. 5D). Given the presence of NSCs in the
adult human SEZ (49), it has been suggested that glioblastoma is
derived from those cells (50). This concept has been investigated
in mouse models (2, 38–40), but until now there has been no
direct evidence of the contribution of SEZ cells in human gliomagenesis. We show that the SEZ is a reservoir of disease and
could be targeted therapeutically. Consistent with this, preliminary evidence suggest that irradiation of the SEZ in patients with
glioblastoma is associated with improved progression-free survival (51, 52).
In summary, we present a phenotypic, genomic, and functional
analysis of residual disease in human glioblastoma (Supplementary Fig. S18A and S18B). Our approach together with FGMS
provides a coherent strategy for interrogating the mechanistic
basis of clinical heterogeneity in future studies. This is likely to
further reﬁne our understanding of the complex molecular landscape of glioblastoma, resulting in improved therapeutic strategies speciﬁcally aimed at targeting the SEZ.
