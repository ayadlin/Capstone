Abstract
An in vivo model of human CD20+ B-lymphoma was
established in severe combined immunodeficiency mice to
test the ability of human neutralizing miniantibodies to CD55
and CD59 (MB55 and MB59) to enhance the therapeutic effect
of rituximab. The miniantibodies contained single-chain
fragment variables and the hinge-CH2-CH3 domains of human
IgG1. LCL2 cells were selected for the in vivo study among
six B-lymphoma cell lines for their high susceptibility to
rituximab-dependent complement-mediated killing enhanced
by MB55 and MB59. The cells injected i.p. primarily colonized
the liver and spleen, leading to the death of the animals within
30 to 40 days. Thirty percent of mice receiving biotin-labeled
rituximab (25 Mg) i.p. on days 4 and 11 after cell injection
survived to 120 days. Administration of biotin-labeled
rituximab, followed by avidin (40 Mg) and biotin-labeled
MB55–MB59 (100 Mg) at 4-h intervals after each injection
resulted in the survival of 70% of mice. Surprisingly, 40%
of mice survived after the sole injection of avidin and biotinlabeled MB55–MB59, an observation consistent with the
in vitro data showing that the miniantibodies induced killing
of f25% cells through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity.
In conclusion, MB55 and MB59 targeted to tumor cells
represent a valuable tool to enhance the therapeutic effect
of rituximab and other complement-fixing antitumor antibodies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10556–63]

Introduction
Several chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
against different antigens expressed by neoplastic cells have been
developed to obtain more specific and less toxic agents for cancer
treatment. However, only relatively few molecules have been
approved for human therapy and new approaches are needed to
increase their efficacy in vivo (1–3). Satisfactory results in the
immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies have been obtained using
two mAbs recognizing CD20 (rituximab; refs. 4, 5) and CD52
(alemtuzumab, Campath1-H; ref. 6), expressed on the surface of
tumor cells and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
the treatment of non–Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, respectively (7).

Most of the information available on the mechanisms of action
of these mAbs has been obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies
of rituximab. This mAb has been reported to control tumor growth
via different effector mechanisms that act either alone or, more
often, in combination, and include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC; refs. 8, 9), antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
(ADCC; ref. 8), or apoptosis (10, 11). Xenograft models of
lymphoma in mice lacking FcR-g chain (12), or treated with
neutralizing antibodies against mouse FcgR (13, 14), have provided
evidence for the contribution of ADCC to the therapeutic activity
of rituximab. Data from several groups are also available indicating
that B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and fresh B-lymphoma cells
expressing CD20 can be killed by complement activated by
rituximab (9, 15–17). The susceptibility of these cells to CDC is
partly related to the expression level of CD20 on the cell surface,
but it is also dependent on the ability of rituximab to induce
the translocation of CD20 into lipid rafts (18), which favors the
clustering of antibodies and, in turn, promotes C1q binding. The
important role played by complement as an effector system in
the anticancer activity of rituximab is supported by the findings
that this mAb is less effective in controlling tumor growth in C1q
KO mice (9) and in mice treated with cobra venom factor (19) than
in complement-sufficient mice.
The complement system has a definite advantage over cytotoxic
cells as an in vivo defense system against cancer because it is made
of soluble molecules that can easily reach the tumor site and
diffuse inside the tumor mass. Moreover, complement components
are readily available as a first line of defense against cancer cells
because they are locally synthesized by many cell types, including
macrophages (20), fibroblasts (21), and endothelial cells (22, 23).
However, a major limitation of complement as an effector system
against tumor cells is represented by the complement-regulatory
proteins expressed on the cell surface (mCRPs; refs. 24, 25), which
provide a means of evasion from complement attack. It has been
previously shown that CD55 and CD59 mainly contribute to the
protection of complement-mediated killing of CD20+ cells induced
by rituximab (8). This observation led us to hypothesize that
neutralizing these two CRPs would greatly improve the beneficial
effect of rituximab on B lymphoma cells. To this end, we have
recently produced two human mAbs neutralizing CD55 and CD59,
named MB55 and MB59, respectively (26). They were initially
isolated as single-chain fragment variables (scFv) from a human
phage display library and then engineered to contain the hinge-CH2CH3 region of human IgG1 in order to produce a divalent molecule,
with characteristics similar to those of a complete immunoglobulin.
In vitro studies have shown that CDC of a lymphoma cell line
induced by rituximab is significantly enhanced in the presence of
MB55 and MB59 (26).

Human mAbs to CD55 and CD59 in Lymphoma Treatment

The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the in vivo
therapeutic effect of MB55 and MB59 used in combination with
rituximab to treat a human B-lymphoma established in severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Evidence will be
presented indicating that MB55 and MB59 targeted to tumor cells
increase the ability of rituximab to eradicate established EBV+
B-lymphoma xenografts enhancing both CDC and ADCC.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and sera. The anti-CD20 chimeric mAb rituximab was
kindly provided by Dr. Josèe Golay (Division of Haematology, Ospedali
Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy). The anti-CD20, anti-CD55, anti-CD59 mAbs, and
the isotype-matched control IgG were obtained from ImmunoTools. Rat
mAb YTH53.1 to CD59 was a kind gift from Prof. Seppo Meri (Haartman
Institute, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland) and mAb BRIC216 to
CD55 was purchased from the International Blood Group Reference
Laboratory. All the secondary antibodies to human and mouse immunoglobulins were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MB55 and MB59 were
purified from the supernatant of transfected HEK293T cells as previously
described (26). Human sera from AB Rh+ blood donors were kindly
provided by the Blood Transfusion Center (Trieste, Italy) and pooled as a
source of complement (PNHS). For some experiments, the serum (NHS) and
the erythrocytes obtained from a single blood donor were also used.
Cells. Three in vitro–derived EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL1–3)
and three EBV+ cell lines obtained ex vivo from SCID mice injected with
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from EBV+ donors (Hu-SCID1–
3; ref. 27) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10%
FCS (Invitrogen). PBMC were isolated from buffy coats obtained from blood
donors or from murine blood by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia Biotech)
gradient centrifugation, and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
5% FCS, 2 mmol/L of glutamine and streptomycin (100 Ag/mL). Human
erythrocytes were stored in veronal-buffered saline at 4jC until use.
Animals. Female SCID mice (4–6 weeks of age) were purchased from
Charles River and maintained under pathogen-free conditions. Blood as a
source of PBMC and serum was obtained from female BALB/c mice kept as
a colony at the Animal House of the University of Trieste.
All the experimental procedures were done in compliance with the
guidelines of the European (86/609/EEC) and the Italian (D.L.116/92) laws
and were approved by the Italian Ministry of University and Research as
well as by the Administration of the University Animal House.
Immunofluorescence analysis. Lymphoma cells (5  105) were first
incubated with the primary antibodies to CD20, CD55 or CD59, or
isotype-matched control IgG (5 Ag/mL) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine
serum albumin for 1 h at 37jC and then with the appropriate FITCconjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37jC. After washing with
PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were fixed with
1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell fluorescence was evaluated on a
FACScalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software.
Complement-mediated lysis. The CDC procedure described by Ziller
et al. (26) to evaluate the effect of the neutralizing miniantibodies on the
complement susceptibility of B-lymphoma cells was followed in detail.
Briefly, 2  105/50 AL cells were incubated with rituximab (2 Ag/mL) with or
without MB55 and MB59 (10 Ag/mL each) to a final volume of 100 AL for
10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of PNHS (25%). After
further incubation at 37jC for 1 h, the number of residual viable cells was
estimated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay (28) and the percentage of dead cells was calculated.
Biotin-labeling of rituximab, MB55, and MB59. The purified antibodies
were biotin-labeled using biotin-aminocaproate n-hydroxysuccinimide ester
(Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (22). The procedure included
overnight dialysis of the IgG fraction against 0.1 mol/L of sodium bicarbonate
buffer (pH 8.8), incubation with biotin at a protein/biotin ratio of 8.25:1
(w/w) for 15 min at room temperature, addition of 1 mol/L of ammonium
chloride at pH 6.5 (1:100 v/v) to block the reaction, and final dialysis against
PBS to remove free biotin.

Mouse model of B-lymphoma. A SCID/LCL2 xenograft model described
by Piovan and coworkers (29) was employed to investigate the in vivo
effects of MB55 and MB59. Briefly, EBV+ lymphoblastoid cells were
expanded in vitro prior to i.p. injection (2  106) into SCID mice.
Lymphoma-bearing mice were treated with saline (as a control), rituximab,
avidin, or miniantibodies. The mice were examined every 4 days for sign of
sickness, and followed until they were sacrificed for serious illness, or up to
120 days.
Samples of peritoneal mass, spleen, liver, kidney, lung, and skeletal
muscle from lymphoma-bearing mice either dead from the tumor or
sacrificed at day +120 were obtained at necropsy. For morphologic
evaluation, the specimens were fixed in 10% buffered-formalin solution
and embedded in paraffin. Four-micrometer-thick sections were stained
with H&E. Immunohistochemical analyses were done on snap-frozen
samples embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound embedding
medium (Diagnostic Division, Miles, Inc.). Four- to 6-Am sections were fixed
in cold 100% methanol for 15 min. Immunohistochemical analysis was done
using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method according to standard
procedures (30), and the slides were examined under a Leica DM2000
optical microscope.
ELISA. The presence of rituximab and avidin in the mouse peritoneal
washes was evaluated by ELISA. Microtiter plate wells were coated with
100 AL of diluted (1:50) peritoneal washes by overnight incubation in
0.1 mol/L of sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4jC and the unbound
sites were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 2% nonfat milk for
1 h at 37jC. The amount of chimeric antibodies was measured using 1:7,500
antihuman IgG conjugated with phosphatase and the enzymatic reaction
was developed with paranitrophenilphosphate and read at 405 nm as
previously reported (31). Avidin was revealed by the Vectastain Elite ABC kit
(Vector Lab) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The percentage
of residual protein was then calculated.
Apoptosis. To investigate the ability of MB55 and MB59 to induce
apoptosis of lymphoma cells, 2  105/50 AL LCL2 cells were incubated with
bio-rituximab (2 Ag/mL) and/or bio-MB55 and bio-MB59 (10 Ag/mL) for
48 h and apoptosis was assessed by terminal nucleotidyl transferase–
mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
ADCC. The procedure described by Spiridon et al. (32) to investigate
the ability of MB55 and MB59 to induce cell cytotoxicity was followed
with some modifications. Briefly, lymphoma cells were stained with the
green fluorescence cytoplasmic dye 5- and (6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidylester (CSFE;Molecular Probes, Inc.), using 25 AL of a
10 Amol/L solution/106 cells for 7 min at 37jC. After washing, the labeledLCL2 cells (2  105) were incubated first with bio-rituximab (2 Ag/mL)
for 30 min at 4jC and, when required, with the mixture of bio-MB55
and bio-MB59 (10 Ag/mL each) for an additional 30 min at the same
temperature. PBMC as effector (E) cells were mixed with target (T) cells
at 50:1 E/T cell ratio and incubated for 4 h at 37jC in 5% CO2. The
cells were then centrifuged and assayed for dye release with Infinite F200
(Tecan). The percentage of specific lysis was determined as: [(test release 
spontaneous release) / (total release  spontaneous release)]  100. Dead
cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and
analyzed on a FACScalibur instrument to control the data obtained by
measuring dye release.
Statistical analysis. The data were expressed as mean F SD and
analyzed for statistical significance by the two-tailed Student’s t test to
compare two paired groups of data. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method was used to estimate survival curves and the log-rank test was
adopted to compare different groups of mice.

Results
CDC of lymphoblastoid cells induced by rituximab is
enhanced by MB55 and MB59. To evaluate the contribution of
complement-mediated killing of lymphoma cells sensitized by
anti-CD20 and the enhancing effect of neutralizing antibodies to
CD55 and CD59 in an in vivo model, we first screened human

EBV-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL1-3 and Hu-SCID1–3) established by Piovan and coworkers (27) for their susceptibility to CDC.
These cell lines were shown to induce lymphoma in SCID mice
(29), and were therefore considered suitable to test the in vivo
therapeutic effect of rituximab, MB55, and MB59.
The cells were incubated with murine mAbs to CD20, CD55, and
CD59 and analyzed by flow cytometry using appropriate FITClabeled secondary antibodies. The results obtained (data not
shown) indicate that CD20 was variably expressed on the cell lines
examined, with the highest value observed on LCL1 and the lowest
on LCL3, whereas CD55 and CD59 were uniformly distributed on
the surface of these cells. Similar results were obtained with
rituximab, MB55, and MB59 extending previous data reported by
Ziller et al. (26) for Hu-SCID1.
Next, we assessed the effect of rituximab (2 Ag/mL) on
complement-dependent killing of EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines
and the ability of MB55 and MB59 (10 Ag/mL each), neutralizing
CD55 and CD59, respectively, to enhance the cytolytic activity of
complement. To this end, the cells were exposed to the chimeric
mAb and PNHS (25%) as a source of complement, and the number
of cells killed was counted after 1 h of incubation at 37jC. As
shown in Table 1, the CDC obtained with rituximab ranged
between 13% for LCL2 and 31% for Hu-SCID2. Such low levels of
cytotoxicity suggested that surface-expressed complement regulators might account for the resistance of these cells to
complement attack. Because CD55 and CD59 were previously
found to be mainly responsible for cell protection from CDC (8),
the cells were incubated with rituximab and PNHS in the presence
of MB55 and MB59. The results presented in Table 1 show that the
percentage of cells killed under these experimental conditions
increased 2- to 6-fold as compared with the values observed in the
absence of the two miniantibodies. MB55 and MB59 were not able
to induce complement-dependent lysis when incubated with cells
and PNHS. Similar data were obtained using two well-known
neutralizing mAbs, BRIC216 and YTH53.1, directed against CD55
and CD59, respectively (data not shown). For further experiments,
we selected LCL2 because these cells were found to be the most
resistant to rituximab-induced CDC in the absence of MB55–MB59
(13%) and the most susceptible to killing after neutralization of
CD55 and CD59 (84%).
Mouse sera obtained from BALB/c and SCID mice were also tested
as a source of complement in the cytotoxic assay of LCL2. As
expected, mouse complement was less efficient than human
complement causing only 6% of cell killing induced by rituximab,
but this value increased to 36% in the presence of MB55 and MB59. No
difference in CDC was observed between BALB/c and SCID mice sera.
Establishment of a human lymphoma model in SCID mice.
To ascertain if the mixture of MB55 and MB59 and rituximab had a
synergistic therapeutic effect, a lymphoma model was developed in

SCID mice by injecting i.p. LCL2 cells (2  106). This resulted in the
formation of a tumor leading to the death of the animals within
30 to 40 days after cell inoculation (Fig. 1A). At necropsy, peritoneal
tumor masses were seen in all these mice as a visible sign of
lymphoproliferative disease. At histologic examination, the masses
appeared as small-to-medium sized aggregates of irregularlyshaped lymphoid cells (Fig. 1B) positive for the human B-cell
antigens CD20 and CD79a (Fig. 1C and D). Foci of lymphoid cells
were seen in the spleen and liver of mice which died as a result of
tumor growth, but we failed to detect lymphoma cells infiltrating
lungs, kidneys, and skeletal muscles (data not shown). The bone
marrow from these mice was not available for examination.
In the first series of experiments, we tested the in vivo
therapeutic activity of increasing amounts of rituximab with the
intent to find the minimal active dose that allowed us to evaluate
the beneficial effect of MB55 and MB59, as combined therapy with
the chimeric anti-CD20 mAb. To this end, the animals received
LCL2 cells on day 0, followed 4 days later by a single injection of
rituximab at doses of 5, 10, 50, or 150 Ag. Four mice were used for
each dose of mAb. One group of mice received 25 Ag of rituximab
twice on days 4 and 11 after injection of the cells on day 0. As
shown in Fig. 1A, the therapeutic efficacy of rituximab was clearly
dose-dependent, with the maximal effect observed at 150 Ag, which
corresponds to the standard dose of 375 mg/m2 used in patients,
and progressively decreased using lower doses of mAb. For further
experiments, the protocol of double injections of rituximab (25 +
25 Ag) on days 4 and 11 after tumor engraftment was adopted as
the therapeutic scheme that was able to induce a slight, but
statistically significant, increase in the number of surviving mice as
compared with the control group of untreated mice.
Targeting of MB55–MB59 to lymphoma cells via the avidinbiotin system. Because CD55 and CD59 are widely expressed on
the surface of circulating and tissue cells, we devised a strategy to
target MB55 and MB59 to rituximab-coated tumor cells, thus
avoiding the risk that these antibodies might bind to host cells and
cause undesired complement attack following neutralization of the
two CRPs. A three-step biotin-avidin system, currently employed in
patients to target radionuclides to cancer cells, was used (33–35).
First, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, we checked
if biotin-labeled rituximab (bio-rituximab), MB55 (bio-MB55),
and MB59 (bio-MB59) were still able to recognize CD20, CD55,
and CD59 using FITC-streptavidin (data not shown). Next, biorituximab was tested for its ability to cause CDC of lymphoma cells
in the presence or in the absence of bio-MB55 and bio-MB59. As
shown in Fig. 2, bio-rituximab caused the death of 12% of LCL2 in
the absence of bio-MB55 and bio-MB59, and >80% in their
presence. These results did not differ from those obtained with
unlabeled rituximab and the two neutralizing miniantibodies
(Table 1).

LCL2 cells and treated on day 4 with saline or rituximab
at the indicated doses (5–150 Ag). One group of
mice received 25 Ag of rituximab twice on days 4 and
11 after challenge. B–D, representative sections from

Having ascertained that the biotin labeling procedure did not
alter the functional activity of rituximab, MB55, and MB59, we
sought to test in vitro the three-step biotin-avidin system prior to
its use in in vivo experiments. To this end, LCL2 cells (2  105) were
incubated with bio-rituximab (2 Ag/mL) for 10 min at 37jC,
followed by 30 min incubation first with avidin (5 Ag/mL) and then
with bio-MB55–MB59 (10 Ag/mL each) at 37jC to a final volume
of 150 AL with washes between each step. NHS (50 AL) obtained
from a single donor was added as a source of complement and
the number of residual viable cells was evaluated after 1 h of
incubation at 37jC. The data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that the
CDC of lymphoma cells observed under these experimental
conditions was not significantly different from that obtained with
unlabeled rituximab, MB55, and MB59.
To confirm the efficacy of the three-step biotin-avidin system in
targeting MB55 and MB59 to EBV+ lymphoblastoid cells, LCL2 cells
were incubated with biotin-labeled antibodies, avidin, and serum

as indicated above, but this time in the presence of 40% human
erythrocytes expressing CD55 and CD59 obtained from the same
donor of NHS. Despite the high number of red cells, the
complement-dependent killing of LCL2 exceeded 60%, a value
not significantly different from that obtained in the absence of
erythrocytes (Fig. 2). Conversely, only 9% of LCL2 cells were killed
in the absence of avidin, suggesting that bystander erythrocytes
bound most of the bio-MB55 and bio-MB59, preventing their
targeting to LCL2 which was coated by bio-rituximab (Fig. 2).
However, binding of bio-MB55 and bio-MB59 to red cells did not
result in cell lysis (data not shown), confirming our previous
finding that the two miniantibodies are unable to activate
complement (26).
Cell-targeted MB55 and MB59 increase the therapeutic
effect of rituximab. The in vitro data showed that LCL2 could
efficiently be killed even in the presence of erythrocytes provided
that the antibodies are targeted to tumor cells. To prove that the

analyzed by TUNEL assay. We failed to detect a direct apoptotic
effect of MB55 and MB59 used both as single antibody or in
combination, and no synergistic effect of the two miniantibodies
with rituximab was observed (Fig. 5A). Next, we evaluated the
contribution of ADCC to MB55 and MB59-mediated killing of
lymphoblastoid cells because ADCC is believed to be an important
mechanism of cell killing induced by the mAbs used in cancer
therapy (19). The results obtained with human PBMC as effector
cells show that MB55 and MB59 are able to cause cell cytotoxicity
only when used together (Fig. 5B). Mouse PBMC proved as effective
as human PBMC in inducing cell cytotoxicity mediated by the
two miniantibodies (data not shown). These antibodies were
found to increase rituximab-dependent ADCC of LCL2 from 20%
to 35%. Neither apoptosis nor ADCC induced by bio-rituximab
were enhanced by the addition of avidin and either bio-MB55 or
bio-MB59 (data not shown).
Figure 3. Clearance of rituximab and avidin from mouse peritoneal cavity.
Rituximab (25 Ag) and avidin (11 Ag) were injected i.p. and their levels were

model system was also effective in vivo, bio-rituximab and avidin
were injected i.p. at an equal molar ratio (corresponding to 25 and
11 Ag, respectively) and the miniantibodies at thrice the molar ratio
(30 Ag each), on days 4 and 11. The time interval between the
injections was chosen by evaluating the time of disappearance of
the individual reagents from the peritoneal cavity as tested by
ELISA in the peritoneal washes (1 mL of saline). The results
presented in Fig. 3 show that 4 h after i.p. injection, only 10% of
rituximab was detected in the peritoneal cavity whereas avidin was
undetectable, suggesting that by this time, a substantial proportion
of these reagents had left the peritoneum. Based on these results,
we selected 4 h as the time interval between the injections of the
reagents in our in vivo model.
To test the effect of bio-rituximab, bio-MB55, and bio-MB59,
SCID mice received an i.p. injection of LCL2 and were then divided
into four groups. Group 1 received saline, group 2 received biorituximab, whereas group 3 was treated with bio-rituximab, avidin,
bio-MB55, and bio-MB59. Group 4 received avidin, bio-MB55, and
bio-MB59 and served as a control. These treatments were repeated
twice on days 4 and 11, and the animals were followed up to 120
days. The combined results from two independent experiments
(n = 10 per group) presented in Fig. 4 show that only 30% of the
mice treated with bio-rituximab survived, whereas the long-term
survival of animals receiving a combination of bio-rituximab, bioMB55, and bio-MB59 increased to 70%, indicating the synergistic
effect of the three antibodies (P < 0.01 in a log-rank test). Neither
of the two miniantibodies used individually in combination with
bio-rituximab and avidin had an increased therapeutic effect
compared with bio-rituximab alone. Surprisingly, bio-MB55 and
bio-MB59 administered alone had a therapeutic effect similar to
that of bio-rituximab, suggesting the direct antitumor activity of
the two miniantibodies. Tumor development was unaffected by
treating the mice with avidin alone (data not shown).
MB55 and MB59 control tumor growth via ADCC. The in vivo
effect of bio-MB55 and bio-MB59 on tumor growth was unexpected
because we have previously found that the miniantibodies are
unable to activate complement (26). To explore the possibility that
the two anti-CRP antibodies might cause cell killing via apoptosis,
LCL2 cells were incubated with the miniantibodies for 48 h and

Discussion
The complement system is one of the effector systems involved
in the antitumor activity of rituximab (9, 36, 37), the mAb currently
used to treat patients with non–Hodgkin lymphoma with
satisfactory results and, more recently, approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and other autoimmune diseases (38, 39). Unfortunately,
overexpression of CRPs by tumor cells restricts the destructive
effect of complement activated by rituximab, limiting its therapeutic efficacy (8, 40). We now provide data indicating that
administration of neutralizing antibodies to CD55 and CD59, in
combination with rituximab, enhances the therapeutic effect of the
chimeric anti-CD20 mAb in an in vivo model of B-cell lymphoma.
The present finding that B-lymphoma cells are protected from
CDC mainly by CD55 and CD59 with a negligible contribution from
CD46, despite the good expression of this CRP on the cell surface,
extends previous observations published by Golay et al. (8) These
data clearly indicate that the expression level of the CRPs does not
necessarily correlate with their functional activity and that the
in vivo neutralization of the CRPs should be tailored according to
their protective role.

To increase complement-mediated killing by neutralizing the
inhibitory activity of CRPs, we have isolated scFv to CD55 and
CD59 from a human phage display library to be used in
combination with complement-fixing rituximab and other complement-activating mAbs (26). The therapeutic use of scFv has
been limited by problems encountered in their large-scale
production as well as by difficulties in achieving effective and
sustained levels at tumor sites (41). To overcome these problems,
the anti-CD55 and anti-CD59 scFvs were genetically fused to the
hinge-CH2-CH3 domains of human IgG1 in order to produce
miniantibodies which exhibit increased antigen binding and in vivo
stability (42). The neutralizing MB55 and MB59 were effective
in increasing the complement-mediated killing of lymphoblastoid
cell lines induced by rituximab to a value of 80%. It should be
pointed out, however, that the susceptibility of the cell lines to CDC
depends not only on the expression of mCRPs, which restrict
complement activation, but also on the cell surface level of CD20
and on the ability of the anti-CD20 mAb to induce antigen
translocation into the lipid raft (18).
The combined effect of rituximab, MB55, and MB59 was tested
in a xenograft model of B-lymphoma established in SCID mice
using EBV+ CD20+ lymphoblastoid cell lines (29), and was shown
by Mosier et al. (43) to induce the formation of multiple masses
made of lymphoblastoid and plasmacytoid human B-lymphocytes
in the peritoneum, liver, and lymph nodes. These findings were

www.aacrjournals.org

confirmed in the present study. The cells used to test the
therapeutic activity of MB55 and MB59 in the in vivo experiments
were selected for their susceptibility to killing by human
complement following neutralization of CD55 and CD59. Our
major concern was that the contribution of complement to the
in vivo control of tumor growth in mice could not be properly
evaluated because murine complement is not as efficient as human
complement in lysing tumor cells. The results of the in vitro
cytotoxic assay show that SCID mouse serum could kill f40% of
LCL2 cells sensitized by rituximab in the presence of MB55 and
MB59. Although this value is approximately half of that obtained
with human complement, we believe that it was sufficient to
control tumor growth in mice receiving complement-activating
rituximab. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that the
therapeutic activity of rituximab is abolished or greatly reduced in
syngeneic and xenograft models of lymphoma established in C1qdeficient mice or in animals treated with cobra venom factor to
deplete complement (9, 19, 44).
The strategy adopted in this study to evaluate the beneficial
effect of MB55 and MB59 in combination with rituximab in
lymphoma-bearing mice was to treat the animals with the minimal
dose of mAb that prolonged their survival slightly beyond that of
the control group of mice. The selected dose was administered
twice with an interval of 1 week based on the observation made by
Di Gaetano et al. (9) that cancer cells were still detected in the
spleen and bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice 2 to 3 weeks after
i.p. injection of rituximab. The complement system is an ideal
effector system to eradicate surviving tumor cells in the animal
model and, likewise, to control minimal residual disease in cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy that impairs ADCC by reducing
the number of effector cells (44).
A problem to be solved for the therapeutic use of MB55 and MB59
in cancer patients was to devise a strategy to target the two antibodies to rituximab-coated tumor cells. The widespread distribution of mCRPs on circulating and tissue cells would prevent the
binding of the two mAbs to tumor cells in a sufficient amount to be
clinically effective and may also cause undesired side effects. We
addressed this issue using the three-step biotin-avidin system employed by Paganelli and coworkers in the clinic to target radionuclides to breast cancer (33–35). One drawback of this system is
that the procedure of biotin-labeling may impair the functional
activity of antitumor mAbs, as shown for biotin-labeled anti–
GD3-ganglioside mAb by Jokiranta and Meri (45). Fortunately, this
was not the case for the mAbs used in this study because they
were still capable of recognizing their antigens after biotin-labeling.
In addition, bio-rituximab retained the ability to activate the complement system and to induce ADCC, and both bio-MB55 and bioMB59 kept their neutralizing activity for CD55 and CD59,
respectively. The target specificity of the labeled miniantibodies
for lymphoma cells was supported by the finding that >60% of LCL2
cells coated by bio-rituximab were killed in the presence of human
erythrocytes used as bystander cells. The presence of avidin in
this system was critical because the percentage of killing of
lymphoma cells dropped to 9% in the absence of this protein,
suggesting that bystander red cells bound most of the blocking
antibodies. We failed to detect the release of hemoglobin under these
conditions confirming the inability of the two MBs to activate
complement (26).
Bio-MB55 and bio-MB59 synergized with bio-rituximab to improve the survival of the lymphoma-bearing mice at 120 days from
30% in the group of animals treated only with rituximab to 70% in

mice receiving both anti-CD20 antibodies and the mixture of MB55
and MB59. It is interesting to note that the increased survival was
obtained using one third of the dose of rituximab that eradicated
the tumor. The finding that 40% of mice treated with MB55 and
MB59 in the absence of rituximab survived 4 months after the inoculum of tumor cells was unexpected. It is important to emphasize
that this effect was seen only because the miniantibodies were
specific for human CD55 or CD59 and did not recognize murine
CRPs (26). Failure of MB55 and MB59 to activate complement or to
cause DNA fragmentation of lymphoblastoid cells revealed in this
study by the negative TUNEL staining rules out the possibility that
CDC and apoptosis are responsible for their antitumor activity,
although their in vivo contribution cannot be excluded. Conversely,
the miniantibody-mediated killing of f20% of lymphoblastoid cells
induced by human or mouse PBMC acting as effector cells rather
suggests that ADCC contributes, at least in part, to the increased
survival of mice treated with bio-MB55 and bio-MB59.
The definition of the relative contribution of CDC and ADCC to
tumor cell destruction in vivo was outside the scope of the present investigation because it would require the use of animals
that selectively lack either effector cells or complement. However, the finding that >80% of lymphoblastoid cells were killed via
CDC when exposed to rituximab, MB55, and MB59, as opposed to
35% of cells killed through ADCC, is in favor of a major role played
by complement in the control of tumor growth under this experimental condition, although the in vivo contribution of ADCC
should not be underscored.

In conclusion, we have shown that the neutralizing miniantibodies, MB55 and MB59, could be targeted to tumor cells
providing a novel therapeutic approach to improve the antitumor
activity of rituximab. These miniantibodies have the advantage of
being entirely human and could therefore be used in human
therapy in association with rituximab, ofatumumab, a newly
developed anti-CD20 mAb (Humax-CD20; ref. 46) and other
antitumor antibodies. There are now ways to modify hinge or Fc
protein sequences to improve the ability of these antibodies to
activate complement or to induce ADCC (47). Repeated injections
of avidin may cause an antibody response in the recipient. Avidins
purified from different sources or produced as a recombinant
protein are now being screened in several laboratories to find the
least immunogenic for human use (48–50). Efforts are also being
made in our laboratory to produce a bispecific antibody (51)
carrying the specificity of the anti-CD20 mAb and of one of the
miniantibodies, MB55 and MB59, as a more suitable and efficient
treatment for malignant B cells.
