ABSTRACT
Despite the development of new antineoplastic agents for the treatment of
colorectal cancer (CRC), oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidines remain the most commonly
employed drugs for the treatment of both early and advanced disease. Intrinsic or
acquired resistance is, however, an important limitation to pharmacological therapy,
and the development of chemosensitization strategies constitute a major goal
with important clinical implications. In the present work, we determined that high
levels of activated Src kinase, measured as phospho-Src at the Tyr419 residue in
CRC cell lines, can promote colorectal carcinoma cell resistance to oxaliplatin, but
not to 5-fluorouracil (5FU), and that inhibition of this protein restores sensitivity to
oxaliplatin. Similar results were observed with in vivo patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
models that were orthotopically grown in murine livers. In PDX tumor lines derived
from human CRC liver metastasis, dasatinib, a Src inhibitor, increases sensitivity
to oxaliplatin only in tumors with high p-Src. However, dasatinib did not modify
sensitivity to 5FU in any of the models. Our data suggest that chemoresistance
induced by p-Src is specific to oxaliplatin, and that p-Src levels can be used to identify
patients who may benefit from this combination therapy. These results are relevant
for clinicians as they identify a novel biomarker of drug resistance that is suitable to
pharmacological manipulation.

Response rates, however, are observed in only 40–60%
of the patients, and even responding patients inevitably
develop refractory disease, with median overall survival
that does not generally exceed 2-2,5 years.
Oxaliplatin, one of the most commonly used
drugs in the treatment of CRC, is a platinum-based
chemotherapeutic agent that forms platinum-DNA adducts
that block DNA replication, leading to cell cycle arrest
and cell death [1–4]. Resistance to platinum agents occurs

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic CRC (mCRC) remains incurable for
patients with surgically unresectable disease. Several
combination regimens including fluoropyrimidines,
oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan, with or without monoclonal
antibodies targeting vascular endotelial growth factor
(VEGF) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
remain the mainstay of care in metastatic CRC (mCRC).

through several mechanisms, including decreased platinum
influx, improved base excision repair, and/or increased
detoxification by glutathione and metallothionein [1, 3].
Reversing resistance has proved to be challenging, due in
part to ineffective pharmacological modulation of these
pathways. Recently, however, Src family kinases have been
implicated in drug resistance [5, 6]. Src is the prototype of
this nine-member family, and it is activated by numerous
growth migratory, and stress pathways [7]. In CRC cell
lines and primary tumors, both c-Src kinase activity and
protein expression levels have been found to be elevated
compared with either normal colonic mucosal cells and
fibroblasts or normal adjacent tissue [8–10]. However,
c-Src seems to experience a robust increase in expression
and activity in CRC liver metastases compared with
metastases derived from other tumors types [11, 12], and
increased c-Src levels correlate with worse patient survival
[13]. The Src proteins belong to a family of non-receptor
cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases that act as signaling
complexes, which recruit and participate in intracellular
signal transduction pathways related to carcinogenesis, as
well as cell proliferation and differentiation, angiogenesis,
migration, invasion, adhesion and apoptosis [14–16].
Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate Src
activity. In its inactive form, the end carboxyl-terminal
Tyr527 residue is phosphorylated by protein tyrosine
kinase Csk. Dephosphorylation at this level induces
a conformational change in the protein, allowing the
autophosphorylation of Tyr at residue 419, which is present
in the activation loop, promoting and activating Src kinase
(p-Src) [17, 18]. In normal basal conditions, 90-95% of Src
es found in its inactive conformation. However, mutations
at residue Tyr527 and the SH2 and SH3 domains, or
alterations in Csk kinase activity, lead to constitutively
activated p-Src. Whereas Src has been implicated in a
myriad of cellular processes that are deregulated in cancer,
current evidence suggests that Src activation is critical
to tumor progression and metastasis [16]. In CRC, Src
deregulation primarily involves protein overexpression,
although the molecular mechanisms have not been
fully elucidated. In addition, evidence from preclinical
studies in sarcoma and ovarian cancer cell lines suggests
that activation of Src reduces sensitivity to various
chemotherapeutic drugs, including platinum agents, and
that this resistance can be reversed by pharmacological
inhibition [19, 20][21–23][24]. For example, treatment
with the Src inhibitor PP2 reversed cisplatin resistance in
a multidrug-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line compared
with its isogenic control [25]. Moreover, expression of a
dominant negative, kinase-defective Src mutant resulted
in increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin-mediated apoptosis
in KM12L4 human colon tumor cells in vitro [21]. As a
result, coupled with the recent availability of relatively
non-toxic Src family inhibitors, numerous clinical trials
have been initiated to evaluate small molecule Src family
inhibitors in solid tumors [24, 26].

The overall objective of our work is to evaluate the
effect of Src inhibition in vivo and correlate effective Src
inhibition with a biomarker that can be used in patients.
With this purpose, we first explored the expression
of p-Src in CRC cell lines and assessed its role as a
predictor of resistance to currently used therapies. We also
investigated the use of Src inhibitors as chemosensitizers
to these therapies in vitro and in patient-derived
xenografts, PDX, and compared the efficacy with p-Src
activation in these tumors. Predicting the tumors in which
Src inhibition may be a valuable addition to oxaliplatinbased chemotherapeutic regimens, and understanding the
mechanisms by which this occurs shall provide clinicians
useful tools to improve the identification of patients who
may benefit from Src inhibitors.

RESULTS
Effect of oxaliplatin in a panel of CRC cell lines
To explore the effect of Src activation, we evaluated
a panel of 8 colorectal carcinoma cell lines (Table 1,
Suplementary Table S1). We first characterized the levels
of active Src (Src protein phosphorylated at Tyr419,
p-Src) and correlated this activation with downstream
pathway effectors. We observed that 4 cell lines carry
activated Src, p-Src, COLO205, HT29, LS174T and
LS180. The remaining cell lines, LOVO, SW48, SW480
and T84, do not contain activated Src. The high levels of
p-Src correlated with increased levels of total Src protein
and maintained high levels of activated p42MAPK
(Figure 1A). We also observed that p42MAPK activation
correlated with p-Src but did not correlate with mutant Ras
or Raf in these cell lines (Figure 1A).
Next, we treated the 8 CRC cell lines with
different concentrations of oxaliplatin and obtained an
IC50 for each cell line. The response rankings from low
concentrations to concentrations higher than 100 μM, as in
HT29 and LS180 are shown in Table 1. The IC50 values
of each cell line were influenced by level of activated Src
(SrcY419), with higher levels observed in chemoresistant
cell lines as shown in Figure 1B. Values were also
influenced by the levels of phosphorylated p42MAPK.
However, the number of cell lines explored was too small
to draw definitive conclusions. COLO-205 does not show
oxaliplatin resistance despite expressing high levels of
p-Src.

Src overexpression induces chemoresistance to
oxaliplatin in CRC cell lines
Although we examined a limited number of cell
lines, which may limit the relevance of our findings,
we constitutively overexpressed the c-Src gene to study
the functional relationship between p-Src levels and
cellular responses to oxaliplatin [27]. We performed

this evaluation in 2 different CRC cell lines with low
levels of endogenous p-Src, T84 and SW480 (Figure
1C, Supplementary Figure S1). We observed that c-Src
overexpression led to activation of p-Src in these cell
lines, with concurrent activation of MAPKs (Figure 1C),
correlating with the previous observation (Figure 1A).
Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition of p-Src with
a PP2 inhibitor [28, 29] causes MAPK inhibition in these
cell lines (Figure 1D). These data seem to confirm that the
activation of MAPKs in CRC cell lines is more dependent
on p-Src levels than on Ras or Raf mutations.
To gain insight into the effect of p-Src activation on
cell line survival in the presence of oxaliplatin, we treated
these p-Src transfected cells lines with oxaliplatin. We
observed that cell lines expressing high p-Src had a twofold higher IC50 compared with parental cells expressing
an empty vector (Table 2). However, the IC50 values

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

did not reach the levels of other resistant cell lines, such
as HT29. On the other hand, treatment with PP2 alone
is not sufficient to induce high toxicity in these cells
independent of the levels of p-Src (Table 2). Finally, in
response to the combination with sublethal doses of PP2,
cells overexpressing p-Src were resensitized to oxaliplatin
(Table 2).
Because CRC patients are also treated with 5FU
[30], we explored whether p-Src is also relevant to the
in vitro response to this drug. The same cell lines were
treated with 5FU, and their IC50s were calculated. We
did not find a clear correlation between responses to
this drug and p-Src levels, even in cells overexpressing
p-Src (Table 3). In fact, inhibition of p-Src by PP2 did not
clearly sensitize the cells to 5FU treatment (Table 3).
Our data suggest, therefore, that the chemoresistance
induced by p-Src is specific to oxaliplatin.

p-Src that were treated with a combination of oxaliplatin
plus dasatinib (Figure 5A). This improved survival was
not observed in mice with low p-Src expression.
The analysis of tumor size at various end points
indicated a similar, albeit heterogeneous, size for all
tumors (Figure 6), suggesting that survival was determined
by tumor growth.
Of note, the increased efficacy of dasatinib plus
oxaliplatin, as compared to either drug alone, observed
in mice with CRC liver metastases was specific for
oxaliplatin. We repeated the experiment with 5FU, another
drug that is commonly used for late stage CRC tumors
[31], but no clear improvement in survival was detected in
mice that were treated with 5FU alone or in combination
with dasatinib (Figure 5B).
In vivo p-Src inhibition by dasatinib is sinergistic
with oxaliplatin in treating CRC liver metastasis,
suggesting that p-Src is a possible biomarker for selecting
patients who may benefit from this combination therapy.

To explore the effect of Src inhibition in vivo, we
used orthotopic PDX models that were generated from
mCRC patients undergoing surgical resection of liver
metastasis. Twenty-six tumor samples derived from these
CRC liver metastases were surgically implanted into
the livers of female nude mice (nu/nu) aged 4-6 weeks
according to the protocol described in the Materials and
Methods section. Of the 26 tumors implanted, 42% grew
and were reimplanted according to a procedure that was
identical to that used for primary sample placement. In
all cases, we observed tumor growth in the liver (Figure
2A). PDXs grow orthotopically in the liver, maintaining
the same architecture and histological features of the
human metastasis from which they were derived (Figure
2B and 2C).
The molecular profile, including the analysis of
Ras, Raf, PI3K or PDGFR mutations, and microsatellite
instability (MSI), also showed identical behavior in the
human and PDX models (data not shown).
From this panel, we selected 4 PDX lines (Figure 3),
two with high p-Src and two with low p-Src expression.
One model, C13, which had low p-Src expression, lacked
mutations in Ras, Raf, PI3K, PDGFR, and had not MSI
(Figure 3), whereas C18, which had also low p-Src
expression, had mutations in Ras and PI3Ka and lacked
mutations in Raf and MSI. On the other hand, both models
with high p-Src expression, C35 and C36, had mutations
in Ras and lacked mutations in Raf. C36 also showed
activating mutations in PI3Ka.
The four liver metastases of CRC tumor-derived
PDXs were orthotopically engrafted into murine liver
and grown for 15 days to ensure proper engraftment.
One mouse from each cohort was sacrificed to examine
tumor engraftment (Figure 4A). Then, the animals were
treated with oxaliplatin, the p-Src inhibitor dasatinib, a
combination of both drugs (oxaliplatin plus dasatinib) or
solvent (untreated control). On the day after the final dose,
one mice harboring each tumor subtype that were treated
with solvent or any of the treatments were sacrificed, and
their tissues were analyzed for the expression of p-Src in
the liver. We found a clear effect of p-Src inhibition in the
livers of mice treated with dasatinib (Figure 4B).
To explore the effects of different treatments on
these tumors, we treated for 4 weeks with oxaliplatin,
the p-Src inhibitor dasatinib, a combination of both drugs
(oxaliplatin plus dasatinib) or solvent (untreated) and
then analyzed the survival of these mice (Figure 5A). We
observed that the survival curves of mice carrying PDX
tumors were not significantly different between untreated
mice and mice treated with oxaliplatin or dasatinib alone.
These results were independent of the levels of p-Src in
each model. However, we observed clear and statistically
significant improvement in the survival of mice with high

DISCUSSION
Despite advances in the development of new
chemotherapeutic agents, advanced colorectal cancers
remains an essentially incurable disease, as all patients
eventually develop drug resistance, resulting in disease
progression and death. Thus, therapeutic strategies that resensitize tumors to these agents may improve outcomes
[32]. In this work, we demonstrated that one mediator
of oxaliplatin sensitivity/resistance in some colon tumor
cells is the active tyrosine kinase, Src. The cytoprotective
effect of p-Src is specific to oxaliplatin and does not
affect the tumor cell response to 5FU. Furthermore, p-Src
(phosphorylated at Tyr419) is a good marker for predicting
the activity of dasatinib in restoring oxaliplatin sensitivity
in vivo.
Src activation promotes tumor progression and
is associated with an aggressive phenotype and a poor
prognosis in CRC [32]. C-Src kinase activity is balanced
by the orchestrated function of protein kinases and
phosphatases that mainly target Tyr530 at the C-terminal
tail. C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) operates as a negative
regulator, phosphorylating c-Src at the C-terminal
segment [33]. Additionally, several cytoplasmic and
transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)
have been found to dephosphorylate c-Src at Tyr530,
regulating its kinase activity [34]. Downregulation of
the transmembrane PTPa has been proven to inhibit Src
kinase activity and induce apoptosis in CRC cells [35].
Moreover, splice mutants of receptor-like PTPa (RPTPa)
have been detected in 30% of colon, breast and liver
tumors. Specifically, the expression of the RPTPa245
mutant in tumors facilitates the activation of Src via
RPTPa binding [36]. In conjunction with the genetic
regulation of Src, further epigenetic regulation of Src has
emerged as an additional factor in CRC tumorigenesis

[32, 37], including micro-RNAs. C-Src upregulation was
correlated with miR-542-3p downregulation. Upregulation
of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) follows, which promotes
further c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation,
as well as tumorigenic and invasive potential [38, 39].
Whether Src mediates growth factor receptor signaling
leading to mitogenesis of CRC cells has not been clearly
demonstrated. Contradictory results show that an elevated
c-Src level does not directly influence proliferation
neither in vitro or in vivo in CRC, but it is now accepted
that c-Src-dependent cell cycle regulation is integrated
through multiple interactions with membrane receptors
and their downstream mitogenic signaling pathways
[14, 16, 27, 40, 41]. It has been described that c-Src
also enhances resistance to apoptosis by accelerating the
ubiquination and proteasomal degradation of the protein
Bcl-2 interacting killer (Bik) via the MAP kinase signaling
pathway in CRC and lung cancer cells [16, 25, 40].
Dasatinib is a dual oral inhibitor of Src/V-abl
Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (Abl),
which also targets a number of other Src family kinase
members and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as
c-kit, PDGFRa, PDGFRb, Ephrin receptors and discoidin
domain receptor 1 (DDR1). Dasatinib is already approved
for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and
Philadelphia chromosomepositive acute lymphoblastic
leukemia [42]. In CRC cell lines, dasatinib inhibits
integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration, with
parallel inhibition of c-Src activity. Moreover, dasatinib
has been found to inhibit FAK and paxillin activation
[42–44]. However, the most relevant finding is the in vivo
detection of a correlation between the inhibition of c-Src
activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the
inhibition of kinase activity in tumors. This observation
suggests peripheral blood may provide a useful surrogate
tissue for biomarker studies with dasatinib [45].
To date, Src inhibitors as monotherapy have not
yielded promising results [46, 47]. However, the use of Src
inhibitors in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or
RTK inhibitors seems more encouraging. Several early
clinical trials are currently assessing these combinations
in advanced solid tumors and metastatic CRC and shall
provide further insights of this therapeutic approach in the
near future [20, 32].
Combination therapy with dasatinib and oxaliplatin
in a CRC metastatic murine model resulted in smaller
tumors than therapy with either agent alone. Oxaliplatin
was proven to activate c-Src through a ROS-dependent
mechanism, and dasatinib-mediated c-Src inhibition
sensitized cells to oxaliplatin activity [48]. Our in vitro and
in vivo data showed that Src inhibition is effective only in
CRC liver metastasis with high p-Src expression at Tyr419,
which also correlates with an increased activation of
MAPKs. In metastatic CRC, Kras mutations are predictive
biomarkers of resistance to cetuximab. However, dasatinib
has been found to more effectively treat Kras-mutant CRC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell lines than cetuximab, and the administration of both
drugs shows better anti-proliferative effects in vitro and
in vivo [49]. Consistent with this, the presence of Kras
mutations in our models is irrelevant to dasatinib-mediated
chemosensitization to oxaliplatin in vitro and in vivo.
Reduced SFK activity by molecular and pharmacological
inhibition also decreases VEGF expression in vitro and
seems to suppress neo-vascularization in vivo [50][51]
[52]. Based on these observations, it has been postulated
that dasatinib may prevent increases in plasma VEGF
during treatment with the VEGF-targeted monoclonal
antibody bevacizumab, and may thereby enhance the
effect of anti-angiogenic therapies. Dasatinib is in fact
currently being tested in combination with capecitabine
and bevacizumab in previously untreated metastatic CRC
patients.
At this point we do not know the molecular
mechanism that precludes dasatinib sensitizing these
tumors to 5FU. It is possible that a higher level of ROS
induced by oxaliplatin may influence the response
by additional activation of Src [48]. This additional
activation will make these cells yet more dependent on
Src activity for survival through an oncogenic addictionlike mechanism.
In summary, dasatinib effectively sensitizes CRC
liver metastasis to oxaliplatin in orthotopically-grown
patient-derived xenografts, However, dasatinib has this
effect only in tumors with high Src phosphorylation at
Tyr419. As a result, high Src phosphorylation is a good
prognostic and predictive marker that can be easily tested
in ongoing clinical trials.

Western blotting
Cells were washed twice in PBS, lysed in RIPA
lysis buffer (Tris–HCl pH 8.0 25 mM, NaCl 150 mM,
NP40 1%, sodium deoxycholate 1%, SDS 1%, Na3VO4
1 mM, EDTA 0.5 M, and complete protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 mM) and subjected to a
3x sonication burst cycle for 5 seconds at 30-40%. The
cells were ultimately pelleted for 30 seconds at 14000×
g. After centrifugation, supernatant protein extracts were
aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use. Protein levels
were determined by Bradford assay using BSA (bovine
serum albumin) as a standard. The appropriate protein
quantity was dissolved in Laemli buffer (Tris–HCl, pH
6.8, 62.5 mM, glycerol 10%, SDS 1%, 2-mercapto ethanol
5%, bromphenol blue 0.0025%), and the proteins were
separated on SDS-PAGE gels (12%) before they were
blotted onto a nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Whatman
- Protrans). The primary antibodies included the following:
anti-Src antibody 1:2500 [EG107] – (Abcam ab32102),
anti-Src (phospho Y419) antibody – (Abcam ab4816),
p44/p42 MAPK (Erk1/2) Rabbit mAb 1:1000 (Cell
Signaling 137F5), and tubulin 1:10000 (Sigma – T6557).
The secondary antibodies included goat anti-rabbit Alexa
Fluor 680 1:5000 (Invitrogen – A21057) and donkey antimouse IRDye 800CW 1:5000 (Rockland Inc. – 605-731002). To inhibit c-Src, an inhibitor of Src family kinases,
PP2 (Sigma #P0042-5MG), was supplied at a 10 μM
concentration overnight before protein extraction.

Patient derived xenograft (PDX) generation
Tumor samples derived from colorectal cancer
liver metastases were resected and freshly collected
from patients. Then, they were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium nutrient mixture/F10 (DMEM/
F10 Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum,
penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin B (100 mg/
ml each; Sigma). The samples were maintained for less
than 2 hours in cell culture medium at room temperature
before orthotopic implantation. Each tissue was divided
into 2 fragments. One fragment was frozen for further
molecular analysis, and the remaining tumor sample was
divided into fragments that ranged from 2-3 mm and
were eventually used for orthotopic liver implantation in
6-week-old Foxn1nu athymic nude female mice (Harlan
Laboratories, Netherlands). The mice were anesthetized
with ketamine. After laparotomy, an area of 3x3 mm
was dissected in the anterior side of the left hepatic lobe.
Inside the dissected cavity human metastasis of CRC was
implanted. Neoplastic tissue grew inside liver tissue. Six
months later, all mice were euthanized, and the tumors
were individually re-implanted and grown in a similar
setting, allowing experiments within a physiologically
and molecularly similar setting. These experiments were
performed according to the European guidelines for
laboratory animal care. This study was approved by the
IBIS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Cytotoxicity assay
Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and PP2 (a
Src inhibitor) were freshly and individually prepared in
deionized water (Oxaliplatin 10 mM, 5FU 32.09 mM)
or DMSO (PP2 30 mM) for each experiment. Cell lines
were seeded in 96-well plates (2.000-3.000 cells per well
depending on the cell size). The treatment was assayed
after the application of decreasing concentrations in a
1:3 fixed ratio to exponential phase growing cells. All
treatments were applied within decreasing doses of
Oxaliplatin, 5FU and PP2 individually or in a fixed ratio
24 hours after seeding. Proliferation was determined by
MTT assay after 96 hours. Cytotoxicity was measured
by absorbance at 595 nm using a microplate reader
(BIORAD iMark™ Microplate Reader); then, the IC50
was estimated using GraphPad Prism 4 software. For
combined treatments, PP2 (10 μM) were plated with

In vivo treatments
Each tumor sample was xenografted individually
into nude mice. After sufficient tumor growth, the mice
were euthanized, and their tumors were collected and
divided onto 2x2x2 mm blocks and then orthotopically
re-implanted in mice liver. Experiments were performed
using 6-murine cohorts. Mice were randomly allotted
to drug-treatment using Oxaliplatin, 5FU, dasatinib,
solvent and combined treatments. Five weeks after tumor
implantation, all mice were treated for 4 weeks (2-5 times
per week depending on the treatment type). Each symptom
of murine distress was periodically verified twice a week
and the murine weight was measured at the same time. In

vivo experiments were completed at a clinical endpoint
according to the IBIS Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Oxaliplatin and 5FU were obtained from the
pharmacy at Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío,
freshly prepared and intraperitoneally administered at
1 mg/Kg/dose over a period of 4 weeks (twice a week,
different days). Dasatinib, (BMS-354825) was freshly
prepared and administered at 20 mg/Kg/dose over a period
of 4 weeks (5 times per week, on different days).

Necropsy procedures
The experiments were terminated when the animals
reached a human equivalent end-point. All mice were
eventually sacrificed and necropsied. Tumors were excised
and measured using a caliper according to the following
equation: tumor volume = [length x width2]/2.
