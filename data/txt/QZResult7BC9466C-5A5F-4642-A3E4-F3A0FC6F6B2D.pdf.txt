Abstract
Drg1 was identified as a differentiation-related, putative
metastatic suppressor gene in human colon and prostate
cancer. Its expression is associated with resistance to
irinotecan (CPT-11) therapy in preclinical colorectal cancer
models both in vitro and in vivo. However, the functional
significance of Drg1 in these processes is unknown. We have
shown for the first time that Drg1 directly binds to the BH3only proapoptotic protein Bim. Depletion of Drg1 by small
interfering RNA induced up-regulation of Bim and its
accumulation in the mitochondria, which correlated with loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of
apoptosis in cells exposed to SN-38. Further analyses revealed
that Drg1 promotes degradation of Bim through the Cullin2/
ElonginB-CIS ubiquitin-protein ligase complex. Conversely, in
the absence of Drg1, Bim was stabilized and bound more
abundantly to Hsp70. These results show that Drg1 renders
cancer cells more resistant to chemotherapy through enhanced proteasome-mediated Bim degradation. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Drg1/Cap43/NDRG1 is a member of the NDRG family of four
genes that share 57% to 65% amino acid identity. Although these
proteins have been proposed to possess the a/h hydrolase fold,
they do not have hydrolase activity (1, 2). Drg1 contains three
unique tandem repeats of 10 hydrophilic amino acids near the
COOH terminus. It was previously identified through differential
screening techniques during stress response, hormone responses,
cell growth, and differentiation (3–7). The gene for Drg1 has been
localized to the chromosome 8q24.3 (8). Mutations in the Drg1
gene are linked to hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (9, 10) and
Drg1-deficient mice exhibited a progressive demyelination of
peripheral nerves (11). Several in vitro studies indicated this gene
to be the target of multiple regulatory pathways. For example, the
enforced expression of Drg1 in the metastatic colon cancer cell line
SW620 has been shown to induce morphologic changes that are
indicative of differentiation and reduced in vitro invasion through
Matrigel and in vivo liver metastasis in nude mice (5). An inverse
correlation has been reported between Drg1 expression and the
metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells (12, 13). Drg1 has been

also shown to play an important role in the context of human
cancer progression. Kurdistani and colleagues showed that Drg1
mRNA cycles with cell division, peaking at G1 and G2-M, with lower
expression in the S phase, and this biphasic expression of Drg1
mRNA was absent in tumor cells (8). In contrast, other reports
showed that Drg1 is highly expressed in human cancers (14, 15)
and its high expression is an indicator of poor prognosis in
hepatocellular carcinoma (16). Also, Drg1 was observed to increase
during colorectal carcinogenesis, suggesting that Drg1 might play a
role in tumor progression (17).
We have previously reported that in Hct116 human colon cancer
cells, Drg1 is transcriptionally induced by SN-38, the active
metabolite of the topoisomerase I poison irinotecan (CPT-11;
ref. 18). The suppression of Drg1 in Hct116 cells using specific
antisense constructs rendered these cells sensitive to SN-38
in vitro and to CPT-11 in vivo with enhanced apoptosis. In
contrast, overexpression of Drg1 in SW620 colon cancer cells,
which have low endogenous expression of Drg1, resulted in
resistance to SN-38 in vitro and to CPT-11 in vivo. In a clinical
analysis of 131 patients with metastatic colon cancer, 40% of the
tumor cells in the liver lesions stained positively for Drg1. In a
subset analysis of patients who went on to receive CPT-11 therapy,
patients with low Drg1 expression (V30% cells staining) in their
liver metastases remained on irinotecan-based therapy for
9.3 months, whereas those with high Drg1 expression (>30%)
remained on therapy for 6.8 months, suggesting an increased
sensitivity to CPT-11 in the Drg1 low patient population (19). These
results indicate that Drg1 is highly expressed in both primary and
metastatic colon cancers. Furthermore, Drg1 may play a functional
role in the sensitivity to CPT-11, such that increased Drg1
expression results in a decrease in CPT-11 sensitivity. However,
the mechanism by which Drg1 renders these cells resistant to CPT11 remains unknown. Here, we report that Drg1 interacts with the
proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim (20) and negatively regulates
Bim protein stability by mediating its binding to the proteasome.
Therefore, down-regulation of Drg1 stabilizes Bim and results in
increased sensitivity to CPT-11.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human Hct116 colon carcinoma cells were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection; cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin; and maintained at 37jC in 5% CO2. The human
gastric cancer cell line MKN74 was supplied by Dr. E. Tahara (Hiroshima
University, Hiroshima, Japan). SK-Mel-173 and SK-Mel-19 melanomas were
obtained from Dr. A. Houghton (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,
New York, NY), and OCM3 ocular melanoma was from Robert Folberg
(University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). Cells were treated with SN-38 (5 mmol/L
stock; supplied by Pfizer, Inc.). For protein stability experiments, cells were
treated with 10 Amol/L cycloheximide (Sigma) for up to 5 h.
RNAi-mediated gene knockdown. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
against Drg1 and Bim (21) were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. The

Drg1 siRNA sequences were GGAGUCCUUCAACAGUUUG (22) and
GCAUUAUUGGCAUGGGAAC (23). Control siRNA, which consists of a
scrambled sequence that will not lead to the specific degradation of any
known cellular mRNA, and Hsp70 siRNA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. They were transfected in Hct116 cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The HAtagged Drg1 siRNA recognition site silent mutant (called HA-Drg1-M) was
generated using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene)
with the oligonucleotide GCTTCCTGGAGTACTCCAGCAGTTTGGGCTG. The
plasmid was authenticated by DNA sequencing and transfected in cells
24 h after the siRNAs with FuGENE 6 (23). The empty HA-CMV vector
(Clontech) was used as control.
Apoptosis assays. Apoptosis was measured using Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis detection Kit II (BD Pharmingen) following manufacturer’s
instructions. Both adherent and floating cells were collected and
resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer. The Annexin V–positive
population was analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) and data were
analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). One representative
experiment is shown. Apoptosis was also measured by quantitative
fluorescence microscopy (QFM) with 4¶,6¶-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI,
Sigma Chemical Co.) for nuclear chromatin staining. Mitochondrial
membrane potential was monitored using MitoProbe DiIC1(5) Assay Kit
(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies) and analyzed by flow
cytometry. The cyanine dye DiIC1(5) at 100 nmol/L penetrates the cytosol
of eukaryotic cells and accumulates primarily in mitochondria with active
membrane potentials. Flow cytometry analysis reveals a decrease in
fluorescence in cells with disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail tablets (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics) and 1
mmol/L NaVO3. Total protein concentration of the lysates was measured
by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and equal amounts of

protein were loaded on 4% to 12% PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The membranes
were probed with Drg1 (graciously supplied by Therese Commes, University
Montpellier II, Montpellier Cedex, France), Bim (Calbiochem), Bak
(Pharmingen), Bid (Cell Signaling), Bax, ubiquitin, and Elongin B (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Noxa (Imgenex), Hsp70 (Stressgen), Cullin 2 (Abcam),
and a-tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies. For immunoprecipitation experiments, equivalent amount of proteins from the cleared lysates
were incubated with antibodies for 3 h at 4jC. Then, 30 AL of agarose beads
(Upstate Biotechnology) were added for an additional hour. Immunocomplexes were washed in lysis buffer and suspended in 4 SDS sample buffer
and Western analysis of bound proteins. The mitochondrial and
cytoplasmic fractions were prepared using the Mitochondria Isolation Kit
(Pierce Biotechnology).
Glutathione S-transferase binding assays. The map of the various
Drg1 deletion constructs used in these studies is shown in Fig. 5B. For these
experiments, the full-length Drg1 cDNA was amplified by PCR (Supplementary Methods). The products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and
directionally cloned in pGEX-6P-2 vector (Pharmacia). The expression of the
glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Drg1 fragments was confirmed by SDS-gel
electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining. In binding assays, purified
GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione beads were incubated with
recombinant Bim protein (R&D Systems) for 2 h at 4jC in 250 AL of binding
buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mmol/L DTT. GST beads were used as
control. The beads were washed thrice with binding buffer and collected by
centrifugation. The bound Bim protein was eluted in SDS sample buffer,
subjected to SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting.

vector or HA-Drg1-M carrying the silent mutations. Blots for the expression of various proteins are shown.

Drg1 Regulates Bim

endogenous Drg1 expression in Hct116 cells by stable expression of
an antisense Drg1 cDNA increased the sensitivity of cells to
undergo apoptosis by the active metabolite of CPT-11, SN-38 (18). A
siRNA-based approach was used to selectively inhibit Drg1
expression in Hct116 cells before exposure to 250 nmol/L SN-38
for 24 h and examined for apoptosis by Annexin V/propidium
iodide staining. Under these conditions, apoptosis increased from
19.1% with control siRNA to 35.5% (Fig. 1A) following selective
suppression of Drg1 (Fig. 1D). This was further evaluated by
DAPI staining in QFM assays. Apoptosis was induced by SN-38 in
a time- and dose-dependent manner in Hct116 cells transfected
with Drg1 siRNA compared with control siRNA (Fig. 1B and C).
Whereas Drg1 expression was decreased with two nonoverlapping
siRNAs, we also found a substantial increase in the expression
of the proapoptotic protein Bim, especially the BimEL form
(Fig. 1D). This effect on Bim was reversed by reintroducing Drg1
in cells transfected with siRNA using a HA-tagged Drg1 construct
(HA-Drg1-M) carrying third-base silent mutations within the

www.aacrjournals.org

siRNA recognition site, thus excluding off-target interactions of
the siRNA (Fig. 1E). The expression of other proapoptotic
proteins, including Bax, Bid, Bak, and Noxa, did not change
after Drg1 siRNA transfection (Fig. 2A), suggesting a relative
degree of specificity for Bim induction. Also, Drg1 siRNA did not
affect the expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1,
and SN-38 treatment did not change the expression of either
(Fig. 2B). Bim expression was also analyzed in a panel of different
cancer cell lines. Down-regulation of Drg1 induced Bim only in
Drg1-expressing cells (MKN-74 and Mel-173), whereas no
induction of Bim was observed in cells with undetectable Drg1
(Mel-19 and OCM3; Fig. 2C), further confirming the specificity
of the Drg1 siRNA. To determine whether Bim expression
mediated the increase in apoptosis by SN-38 following Drg1
down-regulation, a specific Bim siRNA was transfected in
Hct116, alone or together with Drg1 siRNA (Fig. 2D, right). Bim
knockdown inhibited the induction of apoptosis by 50% in cells
cotransfected with Drg1 siRNA, whereas it did not significantly

Figure 3. Induced Bim localizes into the mitochondria and increases mitochondrial membrane depolarization. A, Hct116 cells were transfected with siRNA and then
subjected to cellular fractionation. Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for Drg1 and Bim. Purity of the fractions was confirmed using
the mitochondrial-specific protein OxPhos and tubulin. B, siRNA-transfected cells were treated with 250 nmol/L SN-38, then stained with MitoProbe DiIC1(5) and
subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP ) was used as positive control to uncouple mitochondria (dotted line ). Cells with
depolarized mitochondria show a decrease in the mitochondrial distribution of the dye. One of two representative experiments is shown.

change the apoptosis induced by SN-38 when Bim siRNA was
transfected alone (Fig. 2D, left). These results suggest that Bim
induction plays a direct role in the sensitivity to SN-38 only when
Drg1 is down-regulated.
BH3-only proteins have been reported to localize in different
cellular compartments, including the mitochondria, cytosol, and
microtubules, to sense different sources of stress (24). However,
mitochondrial targeting of Bim is required for induction of
apoptosis (25). Thus, we analyzed the subcellular localization of
Bim in Hct116 cells with or without Drg1. As shown in Fig. 3A, with
Drg1 suppression, there was a marked increase of Bim in the
mitochondria. OxPhos is shown to confirm equal loading and
purity of the mitochondrial fractions. This induction of Bim
correlated with a 2-fold increase in mitochondrial membrane
depolarization when Drg1-siRNA cells were exposed to SN-38
treatment, compared with control siRNA cells (Fig. 3B).
Drg1 promotes Bim degradation through the proteasome.
To determine whether Drg1 affects Bim expression at the
transcriptional level, we performed real-time PCR in Hct116
cells 48 h after siRNA transfections. This analysis revealed an
average increase in Bim mRNA levels of 1.2-fold (data not
shown), which could not account for the 5-fold increase of Bim
observed at the protein level. Furthermore, we also examined the
RNA stability of Bim by treating siRNA-transfected cells with
actinomycin D, and we found no difference in the kinetics of
Bim RNA degradation (data not shown). Hence, we concluded

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

that Drg1 depletion does not affect RNA transcription or stability
of Bim.
Next, we tested whether Drg1 loss affected Bim protein stability.
Hct116 cells were transfected with the siRNAs for 48 hours, treated
with cycloheximide, and analyzed for Bim protein expression over
the time indicated. Whereas in Drg1-expressing control cells Bim
was degraded after 3 hours of treatment, in Drg1-depleted cells
Bim levels were more stable (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Figs. S1B and
S1C), suggesting that the presence of Drg1 favors Bim protein
degradation. It has been previously reported that Bim is regulated
by posttranslational mechanisms, such as extracellular signalregulated kinase–mediated phosphorylation, leading to increased
Bim ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (26). We found
no change in the phosphorylation of Bim after Drg1 downregulation (data not shown). Therefore, we investigated whether
Drg1 could affect Bim ubiquitination. Cell lysates from siRNAtransfected Hct116 cells were immunoprecipitated with a Bim
antibody, followed by immunoblotting using ubiquitin or Bim
antibodies. Bim was ubiquitinated in control siRNA–transfected
cells. However, the ubiquitinated forms decreased in Drg1-depleted
cells, especially 72 hours after transfection, whereas immunoprecipitated Bim was elevated (Fig. 4B, bottom). Hence, the lack of
Drg1 directly accounts for the decrease in Bim ubiquitination and
its rate of protein degradation.
To identify Bim-interacting partners involved in its degradation,
we performed a series of immunoprecipitation experiments. First,

Drg1 Regulates Bim

we found that Bim coimmunoprecipitated with Drg1 but not with a
control IgG antibody (Fig. 4C, top). Previous findings showed that
Drg1 interacted with the heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70;
ref. 27). Thus, we tested whether Bim could also bind to the heat
shock family members Hsc70/Hsp70 and whether Drg1 could affect
Bim stability through these interactions. We found a remarkable
increase in the binding of Bim to Hsp70 in cells transfected with
Drg1 siRNA (Fig. 4C, bottom right). Also, the inverse immunoprecipitation with a Bim antibody revealed binding to Hsp70
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). We could also show that downregulation of Hsp70 by siRNA induced a decrease in Bim stability
when cells were treated with cycloheximide, especially in Drg1
siRNA–cotransfected cells (Supplementary Figs. S1B and S1C).
However, although Hsp70 seemed to protect Bim in the absence of
Drg1, it does not explain how Bim is degraded in the presence of
Drg1. More recently, it has been reported that RACK1 promotes
Bim degradation in paclitaxel-treated cells through the interaction
with the ElonginB/C-Cullin2-CIS ubiquitin-protein ligase complex
(28). Based on these findings, we performed immunoprecipitation
assays using antibodies against these endogenous proteasome
subunits in cell lysates of Hct116 cells, after transfection with
control or Drg1 siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4D (left), both Bim and
Drg1 coimmunoprecipitated with Cullin2 in control cells, whereas
binding of Bim to Cullin2 was decreased in Drg1 siRNA–transfected
cells. In addition, endogenous Elongin B and CIS coimmunoprecipitated with Bim, and these interactions were greatly decreased
in the absence of Drg1 (Fig. 4D, right). As a control, the total
amount of immunoprecipitated Bim is also shown (Fig. 4D, bottom
right). These results showed that Drg1 mediates the binding of Bim
to the proteasome, thus promoting its degradation.
Bim directly binds to Drg1 at the carboxyl terminus. To
further characterize the Drg1-Bim interaction, Drg1 was expressed

as a GST fusion protein and used in binding assays with
recombinant Bim. As shown in Fig. 5A, recombinant Bim bound
to immobilized GST-Drg1 in a dose-dependent manner but not to
GST alone. Next, a series of GST-tagged Drg1 deletion mutants were
generated (Fig. 5B) to identify the region of the Drg1 sequence
responsible for the interaction with Bim. In agreement with the
immunoprecipitation experiments, Bim bound to full-length Drg1
and also to a fragment lacking the amino terminus (DN-Drg1),
whereas it did not bind to D1-Drg1, D2-Drg1, D3-Drg1, or GST
(Fig. 5C). These results suggest that Bim directly interacts with
Drg1 at amino acids 338 to 394.

Discussion
We have previously reported that suppression of Drg1 increases
sensitivity to CPT-11 in Hct116 colon cancer–bearing xenografts
and results in increased sensitization to SN-38–induced apoptosis
in this same cell line (18). Its relevance to CPT-11 resistance in colon
cancer therapy has also been suggested by several recent studies
(19, 29). The pan-CDK inhibitor flavopiridol has been shown to
suppress the transcriptional induction of Drg1 by SN-38 and
enhance SN-38–induced apoptosis in Hct116 colon cancer cells
in vitro and increase the efficacy of CPT-11 in vivo (18). The
importance of Drg1 down-regulation by flavopiridol to the
sensitivity to CPT-11 has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial
(30). The results from serial biopsies indicated that clinical benefit
to therapy was only observed in patients who exhibited a decrease
or no induction in Drg1 protein expression. These findings are
consistent with emerging data suggesting that Drg1 plays an
essential role in the resistance to CPT-11 (31), and suppressing its
expression both by pharmacologic or molecular means could
increase sensitization to this agent both in vitro and in vivo across a

spectrum of tumor types. Nevertheless, the function of this protein
relative to chemotherapy resistance has remained essentially
unknown.
Here, we provide the first evidence of the mechanism of
action of Drg1 in the inhibition of apoptosis. Our study suggests
that Drg1 plays a critical role in facilitating Bim turnover by
mediating its binding to the proteasome. As summarized in
Fig. 6, we found that Drg1 mediated the degradation of Bim
through the interaction to the ElonginB/Cullin2-CIS ubiquitinprotein ligase complex (28), promoting resistance to chemotherapy. The suppression of Drg1 using siRNA results in Bim
stabilization, allowing its association with Hsp70, its mitochondrial
localization, and the SN-38–mediated induction of apoptosis. Bim
knockdown reversed the effect of SN-38 in Drg1 siRNA-transfected
cells, whereas it did not affect the basal level of apoptosis in
control cells. BH3-only proapoptotic proteins interact with
prosurvival Bcl-2–like proteins inactivating their functions (32).
Hence, Bim expression levels have a prominent role in mediating
cell death (33).
Previous reports showed that Drg1 is highly expressed in human
cancers (14, 15, 17). Looking at the expression levels of Drg1 and
Bim in the five cell lines we have tested, it seems that there is a
negative correlation between these two proteins. However, more
tumor-derived cells need to be analyzed to further confirm and
validate the significance of Drg1-mediated regulation of Bim.
Recently, it has been reported that RACK1 reduced Bim protein
levels in paclitaxel-treated cells through a proteasome-dependent
pathway (28). Similarly to RACK1, knockdown of Drg1 by siRNA

induced Bim expression. We did not test whether Drg1 differentially regulates Bim in the presence of paclitaxel. However, by
immunoprecipitation experiments, we could show that Drg1 binds
to a Cullin2/ElonginB-CIS E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in untreated
cells. Whereas this novel interaction needs further characterization,
we have also shown that Bim binds to the proteasome through
Drg1. Conversely, when Drg1 is down-regulated, Bim preferentially
bound to Hsp70. In support of this, we could also show that Drg1
competed with Hsp70 for the binding of Bim in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2). Hsp70 proteins function as chaperons by assisting the
folding and assembly of multiprotein complexes, as well as
participate in the transport of proteins across cellular membranes
(34, 35). We did not find any changes in the expression of Hsp70,
whereas its interaction with Bim increased after Drg1 depletion,
suggesting a role of Hsp70 in Bim stability and/or localization
under these conditions.
Bim also directly bound to the carboxyl-terminal region of Drg1,
which may provide the basis to design peptides or small molecules
to interrupt this specific interaction. Indeed, finding a way to
stabilize and increase Bim levels may provide the means to
increase sensitivity to CPT-11–based therapy. In view of the high
expression of Drg1 in both primary and metastatic colon cancer to
liver, this could result in new treatment paradigms for patients with
this disease.
