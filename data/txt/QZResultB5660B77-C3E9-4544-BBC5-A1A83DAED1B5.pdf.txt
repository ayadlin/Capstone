Abstract
Interleukin-6 modulates immune response, estrogen production, and growth pathways in breast cancer. We evaluated the
effect of several common, functional interleukin-6 promoter
variants in node-positive breast cancer patients enrolled on a
multicenter, cooperative group, adjuvant chemotherapy trial
to determine whether these variants were associated with
clinical outcome overall and by estrogen receptor tumor
phenotype. Genomic DNA and clinical data were collected
from a clinical trial of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by randomization to high-dose cyclophosphamide/thiotepa or observation (Intergroup Trial 0121).
Genotyping for -174G>C (rs1800795), -597G>A (rs1800797),
and -572G>C (rs1800796) was done by site-specific PCR and
PyroSequencing, whereas the -373AnTn repeat was directly
sequenced. Log-rank tests and Cox modeling were used to
compare outcomes by genotype/haplotype and other factors.
Three hundred forty-six patients (64% of trial) had
corresponding genotype/clinical data available and did not
differ from overall trial participants. After adjustment,
patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors and genotypes 597 GG or 174 GG had significantly worse disease-free
survival [hazard ratio (HR), 1.6; P = 0.02 and HR, 1.71;
P = 0.007, respectively], whereas the 373 8A12T repeat
appeared to be protective (HR, 0.62; P = 0.02). The presence
of at least one copy of the haplotype ([-597G, -572G, -373[10A/
11T], -174G]) was associated with worse disease-free survival
(HR, 1.46; P = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier plots show that all patients
in this group relapsed by 24 months from diagnosis. This
poor-risk haplotype was quite common overall (estimated
frequency, 0.20) and twice as frequent among Blacks (estimated
frequency, 0.41). [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4184–91]

Introduction
Despite recent advances in early detection methods and
treatment, breast cancer remains a common and significant health
problem in the United States (1). Women diagnosed with tumor
involving both the breast and z10 involved axillary lymph nodes

have a high risk for distant recurrence and half of all women
will succumb to metastatic disease (2). Estrogen receptor (ER)
positivity is typically considered a favorable prognostic marker (3).
However, a substantial proportion of patients with ER+ tumors
relapse despite endocrine therapy (4).
Tumor-based genetic profiling techniques are currently under
development to identify poor-prognosis, ER+ subsets of patients.
However, it is increasingly recognized that host markers, reflecting
a variety of host-related processes including drug metabolism
and tumor microenvironment, may also play an important role in
modulating cancer behavior and response to therapy. Interleukin-6
(IL-6) is an inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in the
immune response to cancer (5) but also plays an important role
in tumor progression and estrogen modulation (6). IL-6 provides
direct signals for tumor cells, through specific cell membrane
receptors triggering important intracellular signal pathways (7),
leading to increased cell migration (8) and loss of apoptosis (9, 10).
Additionally, IL-6 acts as a regulator of estrogen synthesis
and aromatase activity in the peripheral tissues of normal and
malignant breast tissue (6, 11). Functional polymorphisms in the
promoter region of IL-6 control transcription and expression (12),
providing genetic surrogates for host cytokine production that
likely result in interindividual variation in tumor exposure to this
cytokine.
We previously reported an association between the IL-6-174
GG genotype and decreased disease-free survival (DFS) and
overall survival (OS) among women with ER+, node-positive breast
cancer (13). We subsequently sought to further evaluate the full
complement of functional variants in the IL-6 promoter [-572G>C
(rs1800796), -597G>A (rs1800797), -174G>C (rs1800795), and the
AT repeat at position -373 (-838AnTn)] in a large cohort of nodepositive patients enrolled on a multicenter, cooperative group trial
of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer to determine whether
other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), combinations of
SNPs, or haplotype are associated with breast cancer outcome,
particularly among women with ER+ disease.

Materials and Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study using genomic DNA derived
from hematologic circulating or bone marrow-derived stem cells and
clinical data from breast cancer patients enrolled on Intergroup Trial 0121
(E2190/SWOG9061/CALGB 9496), a multicenter trial of high-dose versus
standard dose adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were included in the
current study if they were enrolled in Intergroup Trial 0121 and had archival
peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cells available for genomic DNA
extraction and subsequent genotyping. Results of Intergroup Trial 0121 trial

have been published previously (14). Briefly, 540 patients with z10 positive
lymph nodes received conventional adjuvant therapy with four cycles of
cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m2, orally, days 1-14), doxorubicin (30 mg/m2,
intravenously, days 1 and 8), and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2, intravenously,
days 1 and 8) followed by randomization to either observation or receipt
of high-dose chemotherapy [cyclophosphamide (6 g/m2) and thiotepa
(800 mg/m2) over a 4-day period] followed by stem cell rescue. Adjuvant
tamoxifen was recommended for patients with ER+ tumors.
The protocol specified stem cell collection at the completion of standard
CAF. Specimens not used for autologous reinfusion were stored at 80jC at
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Pathology Core Facility.
The original Intergroup Trial 0121 consent form included language
specifying that residual biological specimens would be used for future
breast cancer research. Approval for the current study was obtained from
the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board and the ECOG
Executive Committee.
The ECOG Pathology Core Facility at Northwestern University extracted
DNA from hematologic stem cells with the EZ1 system (Qiagen).
Genotyping was done at the University of Pennsylvania. DNA samples were
identified only by their assigned pathology identification number and
clinical information was assigned a case identification number. Laboratory
personnel did not have access to clinical outcome data. Genotypes for
the -174G>C, -597G>A (15), and -572G>C SNPs were determined by
PyroSequencing (Biotage; ref. 16). The -597G>A and -572G>C assays were
multiplexed; genotyping for -174G>C was a simplex assay. Genotyping for
the -373AnTn tract was done as described by Kelberman and colleagues (17)
with modifications to PCR conditions.
The ECOG Statistical Center performed additional follow-up and
delinked patient identifiers from the clinical data used in this analysis.
Polymorphisms were analyzed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by
Pearson’s m2 and Haldane’s exact test. We formally tested for linkage
disequilibrium by assessing for each pair of SNPs or haplotypes, X and Y,
with alleles {a, A} for X and {b, B} for Y (e.g., if X = IL-6-174, then {a, A} =
{C, G}), a standard measure of linkage disequilibrium |D¶| = |P(X = a, Y = b) P(X = a)P(Y = b)| / M, where M = min{P(X = a)P(Y = B), P(X = A)P(Y = b)}
if P(X = a, Y = b) > P(X = a)P(Y = b) and M = min{P(X = a)P(Y = b),
P(X = A)P(Y = B)} if P(X = a, Y = b) < P(X = a)P(Y = b). Because IL-6-373
has four levels, four different values of |D¶| were computed by treating each
of the four levels in turn as the value b (and combining the others in B).
Fisher’s exact test was used to determine if polymorphisms were in linkage

equilibrium with one another and to adjust for baseline demographics and
disease characteristics.
The primary endpoint was DFS, defined as time from randomization to
earliest recurrence, new breast cancer, or death. The secondary endpoint
was OS, defined as time from randomization to death (14). All survival times
were censored at time of last contact or on August 1, 2005 if subjects were
alive and disease-free at that time. Log-rank test P values were used to
determine associations between polymorphisms and DFS and OS. All
associations of significance are based on two-sided tests. Cox proportional
hazards regression models were also used for DFS and OS analysis. In the
multivariable Cox models, we adjusted for metabolic genotypes, CYP3A4*1B
and GSTM1, due to our previous finding that these cyclophosphamidemetabolizing genotypes were associated with outcome in this data set.9
Analyses were done to model the associations between IL-6 promoter
haplotype and outcome using the HAPSTAT program (version 3.0).10 We
used the methods of Lin and Zeng (18–20), which employs the Cox
proportional hazards model (21) to generate maximum likelihood
estimators and their variances in an unbiased, normally distributed, and
statistically efficient manner. It uses a weighted mixture based on the
haplotype frequencies. We first inferred individual haplotypes for each
subject, considering only those with frequencies >1% in the modeling
process. The frequency of each haplotype by race was estimated to
determine if significant racial differences were present. To understand
whether potential haplotype effects differed by race, an approach using the
combined data set but assuming HWE only within each ethnic group was
done, as HAPSTAT does not support estimating haplotype distributions
separately within subsets of the data. Due to the low level of phase
ambiguity, we expect that there is no bias involved. Finally, we analyzed just
the White race subset alone, because the other racial groups are too small
to allow separate estimation of effects on DFS. P values and estimated
effects from these models were calculated and the tests and estimates for
the effect of each haplotype are reported separately (that is, without
adjustment for the effects of the other haplotypes).

Results
A total of 433 DNA samples from E2190 archival bone marrow or
peripheral blood stem cell specimens were obtained from the
ECOG Pathology Coordinating Office. Of these, 52 samples did
not have matches to ECOG clinical case numbers, and 31 were
duplicate samples. For 4 of these 31 pairs of samples, at least one of
the IL-6 genotypes was discordant and so was excluded from
analysis. The discordant polymorphisms varied between these four
cases, suggesting that this was not a failure of one of the genotype
assays. The remaining 27 subjects with duplicate samples had
concordant results and were included in this analysis. Thus, a total
of 346 of 540 (64%) subjects enrolled on E2190 were included in
this analysis.
The clinical and tumor characteristics of the current study
subjects were compared with the overall study cohort (Table 1).
Patients in the current study were more likely to be on the BMT
arm of the study (57% versus 50%; P < 0.001) and had slightly
shorter 10-year DFS (39 versus 43 months; P = 0.02) but did not
otherwise differ significantly from those not genotyped with
respect to race, age, menopausal status, ER status, involved lymph
node number, or tumor size. This cohort was primarily Caucasian
(90%), 30% were age <40 years, and more than two-thirds were
premenopausal at the time of diagnosis.
Frequencies for the IL-6 promoter genotype and haplotypes were
calculated, both overall and by race (Table 2). Genotype failure
rates were 5% for 174G>C and 373AT repeat and 1% for 572G>C
and 597G>A. The genotypic distributions and minor allele
frequencies in our study were similar to those seen in published
studies of other breast cancer populations (22, 23). Genotype
frequencies are consistent with HWE within racial groups. There is
strong evidence that the three SNPs are not in linkage equilibrium
(P < 0.0001 for each pair, Fisher’s exact test). Supplementary
Table S1 shows estimated values of |D¶| based the joint distribution

of the SNPs for Whites. For the haplotype distributions for Blacks
and other races, |D¶| = 1 for all pairs. Comparison of the
distributions of the three SNPs with the IL-6-373 variable repeat
shows that these similarly are not in linkage equilibrium. However,
the 8A12T sequence appears to be strongly associated with the
presence of the C allele for IL-6-173 and the A allele for IL-6-597.
The presence of the 10A10T sequence appears to be associated
with the presence of the C allele for IL-6-572. Associations between
each variant and clinical characteristics showed that all four
variants were significantly associated with race (P < 0.001 for each,
Fisher’s exact test). Only IL-6-597 genotype was associated with
ER status (ER positivity rates 48% for AA, 57% for AG, and 66% for
GG, respectively; P = 0.04). Both IL-6-597 and IL-6-373 genotypes
were significantly associated with number of positive lymph nodes
(P = 0.03 for each).
Thirteen distinct naturally occurring haplotypes were generated
by HAPSTAT; five haplotypes occurred in >1% of the study
population (n = 331), as shown in Table 2. Haplotypes are described
in order (-597, -572, -373, -174) moving from 5¶ to 3¶ along the
promoter sequence. The different genotypes show strong linkage
(tests for linkage disequilibrium were highly significant for each
pair). There is little difference by ER status but a substantial
difference by race; therefore, we controlled for race in subsequent
modeling of the effect of these haplotypes on DFS.
The 10-year DFS and OS for each genotype overall and by tumor
ER status are shown in Table 3. In the group overall, only IL-6-174
genotype was associated with DFS although of borderline
significance (GG versus CC/CG, 32.3 versus 43.7 months; P = 0.06)
and not significantly associated with OS. However, among patients
with ER+ tumors, IL-6-174, IL-6-597, and IL-6-373 SNPs were each
significantly associated with DFS. Because these polymorphisms
are very highly associated with each other, each has a roughly
equivalent effect. This association carried over to OS only for

IL-6-174, with GG genotype associated with worse survival than
CC/CG (31.8 versus 55.2 months), although this was of only
borderline significance (P = 0.06). There were no significant
associations between genotype and either DFS or OS among
patients with ER- tumors.
Because patients in the parent study were randomized between
standard, anthracycline-based chemotherapy alone or with the
addition of high-dose cyclophosphamide and thiotepa, effects
within treatment groups were also examined. The only case in
which there was a substantial difference between the two treatment
arms was for IL-6-572 in the ER- subset; however, the small sample
size in this subanalysis precluded formal association testing.
Because there did not appear to be a significant effect by treatment
arm, arms were combined for the remainder of the analyses.
Results of multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling for
individual SNPs are shown in Table 4. Of the baseline characteristics examined (Table 1), only age and race were significantly
associated with outcome and were thus included in the adjusted
analysis. Although there was a significant association of genotype
with number of nodes, neither number of nodes nor tumor size is
significantly associated with DFS or OS in this cohort. Further
adjustment for number of nodes and tumor size had little effect
on the odds ratios for either DFS or OS (data not shown).
Furthermore, we adjusted for drug-metabolizing enzyme SNPs in
CYP3A4*1B and GSTM1 as prespecified in the analysis. To assess
for proportionality of hazards, we applied the Grambsch-Therneau
test to the fully adjusted DFS model and found that ER showed
significant evidence of nonproportionality (P = 0.003). Thus, a
stratified multivariable Cox model was computed; the overall
model was stratified on ER and separate models were fit to

estimate the effects within the ER+ and ER- subsets. DFS is
significantly worse for patients with ER+ tumors who have either
-597 GG or -174 GG genotype as well as those with the -373[8A12T]
variant compared with the reference groups. The -174 GG genotype
was borderline significantly associated with worse OS as was
the -373[8A12T] variant. Among patients with ER- tumors, none of
the individual genotypes were significantly associated with DFS or
OS. Tests of interaction between ER status and genotype in the
models stratified on ER that included the main effect of genotype
plus the interaction term showed significant interactions for
each individual variant and ER status (ER  -597: Wald P = 0.01
for DFS and P = 0.04 for OS, ER  -572: P = 0.21 for DFS and
P = 0.03 for OS, ER  -373: P = 0.03 for DFS and P = 0.09 for OS, and
ER  -174: P = 0.04 for DFS and P = 0.07 for OS).
We also examined the effects of genotype on outcome in the ER+
subset when other genotypes were included as covariates in the
model. First, the IL-6 -174, -597, and -373 genotypes are so strongly
linked that it is not possible to separate their effects. That is, -174
GG versus other and -597 GG versus other disagree for only six ER+
cases with data on both, -174 GG versus other and -373 no 8A12T
versus any 8A12T disagree for only six ER+ cases with both
evaluated, and 597 GG versus other and -373 no 8A12T versus any
8A12T disagree for only two ER+ cases with both evaluated. In joint
models, the information about the relative effects comes from
these discordant cases, and there are too few of these cases for the
estimates to be meaningful. Also, the high colinearity between
the indicator variables for these factors means that variances of
the estimates are large, and in the joint models for pairs of these
variables, neither is individually significant, although joint effect of
both is highly significant.

NOTE: Adjusted for age (<40 versus 40-60 y), race (White versus Black versus other), CYP3A4 (any G allele versus A/A), and GSTM1 (null versus present).

Joint models fit for the effects of any of these three SNPs and
-572 found that both are significant. For example, in the model with
-174 and -572, the estimated hazard ratio [HR; 95% confidence
interval (95% CI)] is 2.04 (1.37-3.05) for -174 (P = 0.0005) and 2.38
(1.23-4.60) for -572 (P = 0.01). This is essentially what drives the
definition of the ‘‘good-risk’’ group in that it is very similar to the
group with at least one C allele for -174 (or nearly equivalently, at
least one A allele for -597) or at least one C allele for -572. The -373
genotype is needed to differentiate the small poor-risk group, but it
seems appropriate to conclude that only one of -174 and -597 is
needed.
Associations between haplotype ( for those haplotypes with
frequency >1%) and DFS were examined in the population with
ER+ tumors (Table 5). First, the effect of each haplotype on DFS
was examined separately, assuming an additive effect. Race (White
versus Black versus other) was included in the models because

there were differences in the distribution of the haplotypes for
different racial groups, although it has little effect. Relative to other
haplotypes, the A-G-[8/12]-C appears to be significantly protective
(HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.91), whereas G-G-[10/11]-G is associated
with significantly worse DFS (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.02-2.09). The
results assuming HWE and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium are
nearly identical (the P values for the test of HWE in the general
model are >0.50 for all models). The results for the analyses of
the White race subset are also similar for the significant effects.
For the combined race group, assuming HWE, the additive
model with all four haplotypes had a significant overall likelihood
ratio test (P = 0.006 on 4 df ). For Whites only, the additive model
with all four haplotypes also had a significant overall likelihood
ratio test (P = 0.02 on 4 df ). The joint codominant model was also
examined for the combined race group (the codominant model
with all four haplotypes could not be fit for the White race subset).

IL-6 Polymorphisms and Breast Cancer Outcomes

Comparing the model with codominant effects for the four
haplotypes (plus race) with the model with only race, there is an
overall significant haplotype effect (P < 0.0001, likelihood ratio test
on 8 df ). Dropping haplotypes from this model in a backwards
elimination scheme, the first haplotype eliminated is G-G[10A10T]-G, which had P = 0.58 in the joint model. The least
significant haplotype of the three remaining is G-C-[10A10T]-G,
for which the 2 df likelihood ratio test has P = 0.07. However, the
effect is very consistent with additivity, and the 1 df test based on
an additive model is significant. This model suggests combining
the genotypes into three groups based on the following rationale.
First, both A-G-[8/12]-C and G-C-[10/10]-G are associated with
better DFS relative to the reference set. We therefore created a
single ‘‘good-risk’’ group consisting of subjects estimated to have at
least one copy of one of these two haplotypes. The set of genotypes
associated with at least one copy of these haplotypes (designated
‘‘group A’’) includes (AA, GG, 8A12T/8A12T, CC), (AG, GG, 8A12T/
9A11T, CC), (AG, CG, 8A12T/9A11T, CG), (AG, GG, 8A12T/10A11T,
CG), (AG, GG, 8A12T/10A10T, CG), (AG, GG, 8A12T/9A11T, CG),
(GG, CC, 10A10T/10A10T, GG), (GG, CG, 10A10T/10A11T, GG), (GG,
CG, 10A10T/10A10T, GG), and (GG, CG, 10A10T/9A11T, GG).
Another group, considered ‘‘poor-risk’’ (designated ‘‘group C’’),
consists of the six cases with two copies the G-G-[10A/11T]-G
haplotype and has the worst DFS of the group, with early
recurrences from 0.5 to 3.5 years from study entry. A third group
(designated ‘‘group B’’) consists of the subjects whose genotypes are
not in the other two groups, which for the set of 199 cases analyzed
above consists of genotypes (GG, GG, *, GG) and (GG, CG, *, GG),
where * can be any combination of 10A10T, 10A11T, and 9A11T
(except the combination from the group C genotype).
Kaplan-Meier estimates of DFS for these three groups are shown
in Fig. 1. The plot shows a dose-response effect of haplotype group.
Patients in group A with the ‘‘good-risk’’ haplotype have the best
outcomes, those in group C with the ‘‘poor-risk’’ haplotype have
the worst outcomes, and those in group B have intermediate
outcomes. The pair-wise comparisons (noted below the figure)
for all groups are significant, suggesting that IL-6 promoter
haplotype identifies distinct prognostic groups within the ER+
subset. Notably, these prognostic groups are significantly associated with race, with a disproportionately greater percentage of
Blacks making up the poor-risk group compared with the other two
groups (33% group C versus 12.5% group B versus 3% group A;
P exact = 0.03).

that serum IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in patients
with breast cancer compared with healthy controls (P < 0.0001);
median IL-6 serum levels were f10 times higher in patients with
metastatic breast cancer compared with those with locoregional
disease (6.0 versus 0.7 pg/mL, respectively). Additional studies in
metastatic breast cancer patients have shown high IL-6 serum
levels to be associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical
outcome. Zhang and colleagues showed that serum IL-6 levels are
higher in patients with more numerous metastatic sites and poorer
survival (28). Several other investigators have found associations
between high serum IL-6 levels and poor response to breast cancer
therapy (29), including resistance to both chemotherapy (30) and
hormonal therapy (31).
However, because there is tremendous intraindividual variation
in IL-6 spot levels, even in nonpathologic circumstances, and other
factors, including medications, age, and nutritional status, may
affect IL-6 level, we sought to determine if genotype would be a
more stable and robust marker for outcome. Data to date clearly
support the functional significance of the -174G>C polymorphism
in controlling gene transcription and subsequent serum levels of
IL-6 and several studies have linked IL-6-174G>C genotype to
serum levels both in normal subjects and in those suffering either
chronic disease or acute illness (32–34). Moreover, work by Terry
and colleagues (12) suggests that there are multiple functional
SNPs in the promoter region and that these polymorphisms have
additive effects on gene expression. Transfection studies in HeLa
cells and the ECV304 cell line showed that more than one of the
polymorphisms was functional, the polymorphisms do not act
independently, and one polymorphism influences the functional
effect at the other polymorphism’s site. Haplotypes in the ECV304
cell line exhibited functional differences and transcription was
increased in the -597G, -572G, -373 9A11T, -174G haplotype and

Discussion
We have shown that several different IL-6 promoter genotypes
and a specific haplotype have significantly worse outcomes than
their counterparts. This study confirms and extends our earlier
work (13) in a much larger and multicenter clinical cohort. DFS
was significantly worse for those with the -597 GG or -174 GG
genotype or the G-G-[10A/11T]-G haplotype. For the latter, KaplanMeier plots show that all patients in this group relapsed by
24 months from diagnosis. This poor-risk haplotype, G-G-[10A/
11T]-G, was quite common overall (estimated frequency, 0.20) and
twice as frequent among Blacks (estimated frequency, 0.41).
These data shed new light on previous studies in which serum
levels of IL-6 have been shown to be elevated in cancer patients
relative to noncancer controls (24–26). In a more recent study
comparing IL-6 levels in normal, early breast cancer, and
metastatic breast cancer patients, Benoy and colleagues (27) found

decreased transcription in the -597A, -572G, -373 8A12T, -174G. Our
study findings are consistent with these preclinical and clinical
observations, showing that high-production SNPs are associated
with worse outcomes in breast cancer patients at high risk of
relapse and that haplotype is a robust predictor of outcome.
Our finding that these effects are limited to those patients with
ER+ tumors provides further support for the hypothesis that IL-6
exerts its effect on breast cancer cells at least in part through
hormonal pathways. Cytokines, such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis
factor-a, have an important role in regulating estrogen synthesis in
peripheral tissues, including normal and malignant breast tissues
(35). In vitro, the activities of aromatase, estradiol, 17h-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and estrone sulfatase are all increased by
IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a. We hypothesize that patients
with ER+ tumors and poor-risk haplotypes are likely to fail despite
hormonal therapy because of strong constitutive stimulation of
aromatase, overwhelming the blockade by aromatase inhibitors in
postmenopausal women or the blockade of ER receptors in those
receiving tamoxifen, through competitive inhibition. We were
unable to formally test this hypothesis in the current trial, as
tamoxifen use was not documented in the trial participants despite
being dictated by the protocol. However, additional studies are
ongoing to address this issue and clarify whether IL-6 SNPs are
prognostic or simply predictive of resistance to endocrine therapy.
Finally, our observation that the ‘‘poor-risk’’ haplotype was
significantly more prevalent in Black patients bears further study
in a larger Black population. Although the numbers in the current
study are small, these findings, if confirmed, may shed light on an
additional mechanism by which Black patients with breast cancer
suffer disproportionately poor outcomes compared with their
White counterparts (36).
Several limitations must be considered in interpreting the
current study. Although tamoxifen was ‘‘recommended’’ for all
subjects with ER+ tumors in the parent clinical trial, no data were
collected on patients in this trial with regard to prescription for
tamoxifen or adherence among those prescribed the medication.

However, it would be expected from results of other trials and
population-based studies that this is likely to be <100% (37, 38),
although the magnitude of this reduction is impossible to estimate
in this study cohort of individuals at extremely high risk of
recurrence. Based on our hypothesis that increased IL-6 transcription increases aromatase activity, one could postulate that this
effect might be enhanced by the absence of tamoxifen. However,
this is likely to reflect the ‘‘real world,’’ as tamoxifen nonadherence
continues to be an issue. Whether IL-6 contributes to the
experience of adverse drug effects, such as hot flashes, further
contributing to nonadherence, is unknown.
The grouping of haplotypes by outcome is clearly exploratory,
and statistical differences in these groups should be viewed as
such. However, understanding differences in outcome by haplotype
is critically important in identifying subpopulations for whom
current therapy is insufficient and thus provides important
information in selecting appropriate patients for testing of new
agents directed at IL-6-related pathways.
Nonetheless, this is the largest study to date to provide strong
evidence of a role for host IL-6 genotype in modulating outcomes
in ER+ breast cancer. Further studies are necessary to determine
whether these differences are due to immune, hormonal, or cell
signaling effects in ER+ breast cancer cells, potentially leading to
the development of IL-6-targeted approaches to therapy and the
ability to identify patients in whom these treatments are likely to
be necessary and effective.
