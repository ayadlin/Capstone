Abstract
Despite the perception that omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) protect against breast cancer, epidemiologic studies
have yielded inconsistent results. Although preclinical data have been, in general, more supportive of a protective
effect of n-3 FA on breast cancer, inconsistencies still remain, which preclude definite conclusions or in-depth
mechanistic investigations despite 30 years of research in this area. In this review, we discuss key variables that
may account for inconsistencies of results across preclinical studies and provide recommendations for future
experiments testing the chemopreventive effect of n-3 FAs in breast cancer, as part of a multiagent approach
under rigorously controlled conditions. Cancer Res; 71(19); 6091–6. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The role of diet in breast cancer development remains
controversial. The contribution to mammary carcinogenesis
of the specific fatty acid (FA) composition of the diet has
received considerable attention in the literature. Among the
FAs, omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) FA have been suggested
to decrease and increase breast cancer risk, respectively (1).
Evidence accumulated from numerous experimental systems
indicates that n-3 FAs may exert an antitumor action by
altering the cell-membrane phospholipid composition and,
consequently, affecting the expression and function of numerous receptors, proteins, and lipid-derived signaling molecules,
briefly summarized in Fig. 1. This process eventually leads to
the inhibition of cell proliferation and increased cell death.
Sources of n-3 FAs include cold-water fish [containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA; 22:6)], certain seeds (flax) and nuts (walnuts), and
some vegetable oils (soy bean). Plant sources of n-3 FA contain
a-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3). Sources of n-6 FA are vegetable
oils, such as corn oil or safflower oil [containing linoleic acid
(LA); 18:2].
Epidemiologic studies have been inconclusive relative to
the protective effects of n-3 FAs against breast cancer develAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1Medicine, 2Biochemistry and

opment. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition (EPIC), a large multicenter prospective study
(2), reported a marginally significant positive association
(P ¼ 0.10) only in the highest quintile for fatty fish intake
[hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01–1.26].
Another review of prospective cohort studies showed that n-3
FA intake was not associated with breast cancer risk in 7
studies, whereas it was associated with decreased risk in 3
[incidence risk ratios (RR), 0.68–0.72] and increased risk in 1
(RR 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10–1.98; ref. 3). Consequently, on the basis
of these inconsistent observations, no recommendations can
be offered to women about n-3 FA ingestion for reduction of
breast cancer risk.
For more than 30 years, numerous preclinical studies have
attempted to establish whether there is a causal relationship
between n-3 FA ingestion and reduction in mammary carcinogenesis. Although, in general, the results have supported a
protective effect from n-3 FAs, definitive conclusions cannot
be drawn because of inconsistencies due to experimental
variability, which does not allow reliable comparisons across
studies. Establishing a causal role of n-3 FAs in breast cancer
prevention would have a major translational impact because
these nutrients may provide additional health benefits, such as
reduction in cardiovascular risk. In addition, using them in
combination with other agents with complementary antitumor action may improve their efficacy in breast cancer
prevention.
The goals of this review are to analyze the confounding
elements present in preclinical trials that may affect the
accuracy of their results and provide recommendations for
improved future studies. We strongly believe that, in addition
to employing more rigorously defined experimental conditions, future studies should include a multitargeted approach,
whereby n-3 FAs are administered together with other
safe and health-promoting adjuncts with different and/or
complementary mechanisms of antitumor action.

Preclinical Studies Tend to Support a Protective
Effect of n-3 Fatty Acids in Breast Cancer
Prevention, but Significant Inconsistencies
Remain
Preclinical studies should provide more controlled conditions that facilitate examination of the causal links between n3 FAs and inhibition of mammary carcinogenesis. To determine whether this expectation was achieved, a review was
undertaken of preclinical studies using different carcinogenesis models. PubMed searches were conducted for the terms
"fish oil mammary tumorigenesis" and "fish oil breast cancer."
Carcinogenesis models used in the identified studies were Nmethyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU; refs. 4–9), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA; refs. 10–23), 2-amino-1-methyl6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhiP; ref. 24), and a Her-2/
transgenic mouse model (25). Some studies did not include
any carcinogenic agent but simply evaluated the effect of diet
on normal mammary gland biomarkers (26, 27).
Out of the 24 rodent studies identified, the majority
reported n-3 FAs had a protective effect on mammary carcinogenesis (5–9, 11, 13, 15–19, 21–25, 27). Some studies showed
no protection with increasing n-3 FA intake (4, 5), and some
reported promotion of mammary carcinogenesis by fish oil
(10, 12, 13, 26).
Despite the prevailing hypothesis that the ratio of n-3/n-6
may be important for chemoprevention, this ratio was provided only in 11 of these preclinical studies. The studies that
provided ratios showed protective effects at varying n-3/n-6
ratios: 0.16 (11), 0.33 to 0.55 (4, 13, 21), 1 (5), 1.2 (15), 2.3 (when
combined with tamoxifen; ref. 6), 3.1 (23), 7 (14), and 10 (27).
Promotion of carcinogenesis was observed with an n-3/n-6

6092

Cancer Res; 71(19) October 1, 2011

ratio of 0.33 to 0.5 in a high-fat diet (39% calories from fat),
whereas protection was observed with the same ratio in the
presence of a low-fat diet (16% calories from fat; ref. 13).
Promotion of carcinogenesis was observed by Sasaki and
colleagues with increasing n-3/n-6 ratios (ranging from 0.01
to 7.84) within a low-fat diet (10). On the basis of these studies,
no clear ratio has been detected as being protective.
In summary, most, but not all, preclinical studies have
shown prevention of breast cancer by n-3 FA intake. However,
the experimental conditions under which n-3 FAs exert their
protective effect have been variable from study to study,
preventing unifying conclusions.

Confounding Factors That May Contribute to
Variability Seen in Preclinical Studies
Variability in n-3 fatty acid content of the diet
In studies using menhaden oil as the main source of n-3 FA,
the oil was obtained from suppliers in Japan and in the United
States. Other sources of n-3 FAs used were cod liver oil, sardine
oil, purified DHA/EPA esters, and fish oil supplements. This
variability in the source of n-3 FAs is likely to have introduced
significant experimental variability among studies, because
n-3 FA levels differ among fish species, as well as within the
same species, owing to their developmental age, the season,
and their diet at time of harvest, thus making it difficult to
compare them to one another (28). Only 2 studies (4, 22)
verified the chemical composition of the diet. Most studies
reported the composition information provided to them by
their fish oil supplier (6, 7, 16, 24–26), which may vary, as
suggested by the reported range of concentrations of individual FA expected to be present in a batch of fish oil. Such

Fish Oil and Mammary Carcinogenesis

variation may be biologically important if the beneficial effect
of fish oil is restricted to a narrow n-3/n-6 ratio or to specific
FAs. Other studies verified the chemical composition of the oil
prior to adding it to the diet but not of the diet fed to the
animals (5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15). In 4 studies (17–20), the authors
gave their rats fish oil supplement (Maxepa) intragastrically,
instead of mixing it in the diet. Such bolus administration
could change the biologic effect of n-3 FAs. Some studies did
not provide information on the composition of the diet or
cited a prior study for the diet composition (8, 11, 13, 21, 23,
27). Because of this variability, it is essential that the specific
FA chemical composition of the diets used in carcinogenesis
experiments be determined. In the absence of this information, comparison and interpretation of results across studies is
impossible.
n-3/n-6 Fatty acid ratio
The n-3/n-6 ratio is hypothesized to be an important factor
in n-3 FA chemopreventive effectiveness, not only because the
ratio affects the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA but also
because n-3 and n-6 series eicosanoids compete for the same
enzymes that are involved in their metabolism. In vivo studies
suggest that the modulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis
depends on the ratio rather than the absolute levels of n-3
and n-6 FAs (29). On the basis of the above discussion, an
accurate global n-3/n-6 ratio can only be determined if the
chemical composition of diet samples are analyzed. More
importantly, without specific FA composition data, the ratio
of specific n-3 FAs and n-6 FAs cannot be calculated, a major
limitation because various FAs are known to exert different
biologic activities. Instead, most of the studies provided a
calculated n-3/n-6 ratio on the basis of the information
provided by the supplier or reported the percentage of fish
oil (out of the total fat intake) fed to the animals. Therefore, in
these studies it is difficult to establish the actual ratio of n-3
FAs to n-6 FAs fed to the animals.
Type and bioavailability of n-3 fatty acids
Although most studies used fish oil as the source of n-3
FAs, others used purified EPA alone, DHA alone, or both
combined. This variability in experimental approach can
lead to different biologic effects because fish oil causes a
more global change in FA composition of the diet compared
with administering individual n-3 FAs, which, in turn, can
differ significantly among one another in biologic activity.
Manipulation of fish oil, which may occur in preparation of
diets, may also alter efficacy of n-3 FAs, because it increases
their susceptibility to oxidation (30). n-3 FAs processed into
supplement form compared with those derived directly from
the fish differ in their FA position on the triglyceride
molecule, which has been shown to affect absorption (30).
A triglyceride consists of a glycerol molecule with 3 FA
chains, denoted often as sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3. In fish oil
supplements, DHA is always located at the sn-2 position of
the triglyceride backbone, whereas EPA can be in any of the
3 triglyceride backbones (sn-1, sn-2, sn-3). In contrast, seal
fat EPA and DHA are usually located in the sn-1 and sn-3
positions only. Positioning on sn-1 or sn-3 allows easier

www.aacrjournals.org

release by pancreatic lipase and, therefore, improved
absorption (30). Analysis of plasma and mammary tissue
FAs would reflect the influence of the experimental diet on
circulating and target tissue FA composition. Out of the 24
studies reviewed, only 6 reported serum FA analysis (4, 6, 7,
11, 14, 22), and 7 reported mammary tumor FA analysis (5, 7–
9, 11, 12, 22). Again, this factor severely limits the ability to
interpret results or to make cross-study comparisons.
Influence of the percentage of total calorie intake from
fat and specific fat composition of the diet
The overall percentage of calories from fat, as well as the
specific n-3 FA and n-6 FA composition of the diet, including
other FAs such as monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated
FA (SFA), are likely to be important factors in the promotion
versus inhibition of mammary carcinogenesis. The American
Dietetic Association recommends that 20% to 35% of calories
should come from fat. An equal percentage of calories (10%)
should come from SFA, MUFA, and polyunsaturated FA
(PUFA). In our analysis, the majority of the previous studies
did not follow this dietary recommendation.
The importance of the percentage of caloric intake from fat
on the effect of fish oil is illustrated by Olivo and colleagues
(13). These investigators reported increased tumor incidence
when n-3 FA was added to a high-fat diet (39% of calories),
whereas a protective effect was observed when it was added to
a low-fat diet (16% of calories).
The importance of the specific FA composition of the diet
other than n-3 FA is suggested by Hopkins and colleagues (12).
These investigators found that administration of even a small
amount of fish oil (3%) to a high-SFA diet promoted carcinogenesis to a greater extent than did a diet high in SFA alone.
Sasaki and colleagues (10) also found that increasing n-3
FA promoted carcinogenesis. However, to maintain the
PUFA/SFA ratio constant, they mixed different proportions
of coconut and safflower oil, which could have influenced the
procarcinogenic effect of n-3 FAs. In the aggregate, these
findings suggest that recommendations about fish oil ingestion need to take into account the composition of the rest of
the FAs in the diet.
Genetic variability
Genetic variability is prevalent in the metabolism of n-3
FAs and n-6 FAs, which may interfere with the effectiveness
of n-3 FA supplementation. The plasma levels of both FAs
are based not only on dietary intake but also on endogenous
metabolism of their precursors (ALA and LA) by desaturase
and elongase enzymes. The gene cluster of fatty acid desaturases (FADS1 and FADS2) is polymorphic and involved in
the metabolism of the LA (n-6) and ALA (n-3) series leading
to arachidonic acid (AA) and EPA, respectively. Differences
in the level of activities of these enzymes could significantly
influence the n-3/n-6 ratio when rats (or humans) are
exposed to diets rich in both FAs. This factor is particularly
important when n-3 FAs are derived from plants (rich in
ALA) as opposed to marine fish oils, which are rich in the
more distal FAs, such as EPA and DHA. The use of appropriate transgenic and knockout mouse models in future

Signori et al.

studies may offer an opportunity to test the influence of
genetic variability in FA metabolism on mammary carcinogenesis.
Timing of diet
Timing of the diet, both with regard to the rodent's life
cycle (prepubertal versus adult) and carcinogen administration (before or after initiation of diet), is also a factor
that adds variability to the studies, making them difficult to
compare with one another. Epidemiologic evidence in
humans suggests that dietary changes early in life influence
the risk of breast cancer susceptibility. Olivo and colleagues
(13) specifically looked at prepubertal exposure to fish oil
prior to carcinogen administration. Therefore, the conclusions from this report cannot be extrapolated to the rest of
the studies in which fish oil was administered to pubertal
rats. The n-3 FAs were administered sometimes before and
sometimes after the carcinogen for the duration of the
experiment. This factor may also introduce a major confounding variable in comparing studies because some studies may examine fish oil effect on initiation and others on
promotion of carcinogenesis.

Recommendations
Controlled experimental conditions
Our review is unique in that it represents the first attempt to
systematically analyze the possible confounding variables
responsible for the inconsistent effects of fish oil on mammary
carcinogenesis reported in the literature. On the basis of our
analysis, we propose the following recommendations for the
design of future preclinical studies testing the chemopreventive
efficacy of n-3 FAs on mammary carcinogenesis:
(i) Use translationally relevant diets so that protective
effects can be better extrapolated for use in humans;
for instance, using a diet with 20% to 35% of calories
from fat or one that adheres to the recommended
percentage of calories from SFA and MUFA (10% each),
according to the American Dietetic Association. Using
diets containing extremes of calories from fat would
generate conclusions that are not directly applicable to
humans. Keeping these dietary components constant
across studies will make it possible to better evaluate
the specific effects of n-3 FAs and n-6 FAs on mammary carcinogenesis, without the confounding effects
of variable amounts of SFA and MUFA. Furthermore,
the effects of n-3 FAs can be evaluated within the
context of an overall healthy diet.
(ii) Experimentally verify the FA composition of the
diets used in view of the multifactorial variability of
n-3 FA sources and bioavailability. Performing a diet
analysis makes it possible to determine an actual
(instead of calculated) n-3/n-6 ratio, thus allowing
us to establish if there is a ratio that consistently
provides benefits.
(iii) Perform FA analysis in the plasma and within the
target tissues to allow better comparison of results

6094

Cancer Res; 71(19) October 1, 2011

across studies. This will allow us to establish whether
differences among studies using experimentally verified similar diets are due to differences in systemic or
tissue-specific metabolism of FA.
(iv) Test the influence of FADS1 and FADS2 on n-3 FA
effect on mammary carcinogenesis by doing chemoprevention studies in transgenic and knockout mice in
which the activity of these enzymes has been genetically manipulated. This is a translationally important
issue because genetic polymorphism of FADS1 and
FADS2 has been reported in humans.

Combination strategies
Breast cancer development requires the coordinated activation of multiple cellular mechanisms. To optimally inhibit
mammary carcinogenesis, we need to adopt a multitargeted
approach. In addition, to be applicable to a healthy population
of women, a prevention strategy needs to be safe and easy to
implement. The n-3 FAs are a class of compounds that could
meet both of these criteria if the optimal conditions for their
administration can be determined. From a mechanistic point
of view, n-3 FAs are particularly attractive, as they have the
potential of affecting multiple cellular pathways involved in
tumor biology (Fig. 1). Elucidation of which of these mechanisms are specifically involved in mammary carcinogenesis
should be a major focus of future research. Furthermore,
combinations with other agents with complementary
mechanisms of action that may enhance the antitumor effects
of n-3 FA should be tested.
A multitargeted approach tested by Chatterjee and colleagues (20) evaluated the combination of vitamin D with Maxepa (a fish oil supplement) in inhibiting DMBA-induced
carcinogenesis. The authors observed that the combination
strategy was twice as effective as the individual treatments in
reducing tumor incidence and multiplicity.
Our laboratories have tested a novel approach to breast
cancer prevention by combining antiestrogens with an n-3
FA–rich diet. We have observed that the combination of
tamoxifen and a fish oil–rich diet inhibited MNU-induced
rat mammary tumor formation and multiplicity to a greater
extent than the individual interventions (6). In an ongoing
parallel clinical trial conducted in healthy postmenopausal
women (NCT00723398), we are testing the potential superiority
of the combination of the antiestrogen raloxifene and the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved n-3 FA preparation Lovaza (GlaxoSmithKline) in reducing mammographic breast density, a risk factor for breast cancer. Of
interest, 2 clinical trials (NCT00612560 and NCT00635908)
are testing the combination of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole and flaxseed (a source of n-3 FAs) for treatment of
breast cancer.
In summary, we believe that n-3-FAs play an important role
in breast cancer prevention, provided that they are administered under optimal conditions, which have not been experimentally determined despite multiple studies for more than 30
years. From a mechanistic perspective, a strong rationale
exists for the significant potential of n-3 FAs to inhibit

carcinogenesis, especially when they are combined with other
agents that exert different mechanisms of action. However,
complex dietary interactions can occur among dietary lipids
that can modulate the activity of n-3 FAs. To take advantage of
this potential, a new paradigm is needed through which the
dietary conditions that maximize protective activity can be
determined.
Based on our review of the literature, we have presented
here some suggestions for more rigorously controlled future
studies that may be able to test whether there is, indeed, a
causal relationship between n-3 FA ingestion and reduced
breast cancer risk. If these studies are conducted in a translationally relevant fashion, their results will help to properly

design clinical trials, eventually leading to evidence-based
recommendations for women.
