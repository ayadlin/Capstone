Abstract
+

Proton pumps like the vacuolar-type H ATPase (V-ATPase) are
involved in the control of cellular pH in normal and tumor
cells. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) induces
sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics via modifications of cellular pH gradients. It is also known that low pH
is the most suitable condition for a full PPI activation. Here, we
tested whether PPI treatment in unbuffered culture conditions
could affect survival and proliferation of human B-cell tumors.
First, we showed that PPI treatment increased the sensitivity to
vinblastine of a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell
line. PPI, per se, induced a dose-dependent inhibition of
proliferation of tumor B cells, which was associated with a
dose- and time-dependent apoptotic-like cytotoxicity in B-cell
lines and leukemic cells from patients with pre-B ALL. The
effect of PPI was mediated by a very early production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), that preceded alkalinization of
lysosomal pH, lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and
cytosol acidification, suggesting an early destabilization of the
acidic vesicular compartment. Lysosomal alterations were
followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, release
of cytochrome c, chromatin condensation, and caspase
activation. However, inhibition of caspase activity did not
affect PPI-induced cell death, whereas specific inhibition of
ROS by an antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) significantly delayed
cell death and protected both lysosomal and mitochondrial
membranes. The proapoptotic activity of PPI was consistent
with a clear inhibition of tumor growth following PPI
treatment of B-cell lymphoma in severe combined immunodeficient mice. This study further supports the importance of
acidity and pH gradients in tumor cell homeostasis and
suggests new therapeutic approaches for human B-cell tumors
based on PPI. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5408–17]

Introduction
The hypoxic conditions and consequent acidity of tumor
microenvironment play a key role contributing to tumor progression, chemoresistance, and metastatic behaviour (1, 2). Cancers

face acidity with an up-regulated proton extrusion activity that
allows tumor cells to survive in this unfavorable condition (3–5).
Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that acidic vesicles play a
role in tumor homeostasis and growth. An indirect evidence is
provided by the fact that metastatic cells express more lysosomal
proteins on the cell surface, suggesting that an aberrant
compartmentalization of lysosomal-like activity operates in
malignant tumor cells (6, 7).
A key mechanism controlling cellular pH is mediated by
vacuolar-type H+ ATPases (V-ATPase; ref. 8), ATP-dependent
proton transporters that are normally expressed in intracellular
compartments like lysosomes, endosomes, and secretory vesicles
and on plasma membrane as well (8, 9). The up-regulated V-ATPase
activity (10–12) and increased membrane V-ATPase expression
detected in some human tumors are associated with chemoresistance and metastatic behavior of cancer cells (13). Classic VATPase inhibitors (e.g., bafilomycins) induce cell death in tumor
cell lines (14), but these compounds are highly toxic and not
suitable for clinical use in humans. Recently, it has been shown that
in vivo inhibition of V-ATPase activity by RNA interference
significantly delays human cancer growth by decreased proton
extrusion (15), suggesting that pH regulation may have a key role in
tumor homeostasis.
Human B-cell tumors, including acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL)
and lymphomas, are currently treated with poly-chemotherapies
resulting in good response rates (16, 17). However, a relevant
proportion of patients is not cured from the disease because of
chemoresistance and/or relapses. Moreover, recent therapy
improvements have been often achieved by dose intensification,
paying the price of severe toxicity and secondary malignancies
(17, 18). Thus, preclinical studies on novel therapeutic approaches
are needed.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPI), like omeprazole and esomeprazole, are the standard of treatment for acid-related diseases (19).
They act as potent inhibitors of the gastric acid pump and have
been used for short- or long-term treatments also with very high
doses (150 mg/d) without major side effects (19, 20). Besides
targeting the gastric acid pump, PPI inhibit the V-ATPase activity
(21–23). We reported that PPI sensitize chemoresistant human
tumors to cytotoxic drugs (24), suggesting that proton pump
activity may affect cancer cells homeostasis and particularly acidic
vesicles trafficking (5, 24). Moreover, it is known that PPI need an
acidic environment to be fully activated, in turn suggesting a
specific delivery for acidic environment, such as tumors (5, 25).
Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of proton pumps activity by
PPI might deprive tumor cells of an important homeostatic
mechanism, in turn leading to cell death.

PPI as Antineoplastic Drugs for Human B-Cell Tumors

Materials and Methods
Reagents and chemicals. Omeprazole and esomeprazole sodium salts
were kindly provided by Astra-Zeneca and resuspended in saline (NaCl,
0.9%) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL immediately before use, following the
instructions of the manufacturer. Vinblastine sulfate (Eli Lilly) was
resuspended in saline at a concentration of 10 mg/mL and used within
1 week. Bafilomycin A1 and nigericin (Sigma) were respectively resuspended
in DMSO and ethanol and used at the indicated concentrations. The pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem) was used at 50 to 200 Amol/L,
and recombinant Fas ligand (R&D Systems) was used at 200 ng/mL. Nacetylcysteine (NAC), hydrohetidine, and acridine orange were from
Molecular Probes.
Cell culture and clinical samples. The cell lines Daudi and Raji (human
B-cell lymphomas), Nalm-6 (pre-B ALL), and Jurkat (T-cell leukemia) were
kept in culture with RPMI 1640 (Cambrex) supplemented with antibiotics
(Sigma) and 10% FCS (Cambrex). Unbuffered culture medium was prepared
without sodium carbonate. Bone marrow aspirations were obtained from
five children attending the Astrid Lindgren Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) at
diagnosis of pre-B ALL (Supplementary Table S1). ALL bone marrow cells
were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia) gradient separation and frozen
in liquid nitrogen until analysis. For cell death experiments, the viability of
cryopreserved bone marrow cells was measured immediately after thawing
by trypan blue exclusion, and only cells with viability >90% were used in the
study. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were obtained from healthy
donors (n = 3) through magnetic cell sorting with anti-CD14 beads (Miltenyi
Biotec) following manufacturer’s instructions. The purified cells were
seeded in 24-well plates (0.5  106 per well) for 5 days and then used for
analysis of PPI toxicity in unbuffered culture medium. The ethical
committees at the Karolinska Hospital and Istituto Superiore di Sanità
approved the study, and samples were collected after informed consent
from the parents of ALL children and from healthy donors in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Proliferation assay. The B-cell lines were plated in 96-well plates
at a concentration of 10,000 per milliliter (200 AL per well) in buffered
and unbuffered medium. The next day, omeprazole (or esomeprazole)
was added to the wells at increasing concentrations (0, 17, 35, 70, and
140 Amol/L). The cells were kept in culture for 2 days, and thymidine
incorporation was measured by adding 1 ACi 3H-labeled thymidine per well
(Pierce Biotechnology) to the cultures for the last 18 h. All experiments were
run in triplicate wells and repeated at least twice.
Cell death and apoptosis determination. The effects of PPI
pretreatment on vinblastine cytotoxicity were evaluated on Nalm-6 cells.
Cells were cultured overnight in unbuffered medium, and PPI were added
8 or 24 h before the addition of different concentrations of vinblastine.
Three days later, the cells were stained with 0.05% trypan blue for 10 min at
room temperature and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) in the FL3 channel to determine the percentage of dead cells.
For experiments on the direct cytotoxic effects of PPI, cell lines were
cultured in unbuffered medium at 0.25  106 per milliliter in 24- to 48-well
plates in duplicate wells and incubated overnight. The next day, PPI were
added, and after 2 days, the cells were collected and analyzed. Cell viability
was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion dye as above. Determination of
apoptosis was done by staining the cells with Annexin V-FITC and propidium
iodide (PI) following manufacturer’s instructions (BD PharMingen), and
apoptotic cells were defined as Annexin V–positive cells. Cells were sorted on
a Becton Dickinson FACScan machine, and at least 10,000 cells per sample
were analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Systems).
The effects of omeprazole treatment on leukemic blasts from patients
with pre-B ALL were evaluated on bone marrow–purified mononuclear
cells. The cells were cultured in unbuffered medium at 1  106 per milliliter
in 96-well plates in duplicate wells and incubated overnight. Omeprazole
(0–200 Amol/L) was added the next day, and apoptosis was measured 2 days
after treatment. The analysis was done on the gate of bone marrow cells
previously shown to be represented by >90% CD19+ leukemic cells (26).
Lysosomal stability assessment. LysoTracker probes (Molecular
Probes) and acridine orange accumulate in lysosomes and are used for

the staining and semiquantitative evaluation of acidic intracellular
organelles by fluorescence microscopy and FACS (27). The probes were
used according to manufacturer’s indications to measure the effects of PPI
treatment on acidic vesicle pH, presence, and distribution. For the
evaluation of lysosomal permeability, cells were incubated with LysoTracker
Green DND-26 (1 Amol/L, 30 min at 37jC) or acridine orange (5 Amol/L,
10 min at 37jC) and analyzed by FACS. The experiments were repeated at
least thrice in duplicate wells, and untreated and unstained cells were used
to set the background fluorescence.
Evaluation of lysosomal acidity. LysoSensor Green DND-189 accumulates in lysosomes and acidic organelles (28). The probe exhibits a pHdependent increase in fluorescence intensity on acidification and was used to
monitor changes in the pH of acidic vesicles. Human B-cell lines (0.5  105
cells) were collected from untreated cultures and after PPI treatment at
different time points and washed twice in PBS. The cells were incubated for
1 min at 37jC with 500 AL pre-warmed PBS containing 1 Amol/L LysoSensor
probe, then immediately transferred on ice and analyzed by flow cytometry
collecting FL1 fluorescence within 2 min. Statistical analysis was done by the
parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on a population of at least 20,000 cells.
Cytochrome c quantification. The amount of cytosolic cytochrome c in
Nalm-6 cells was quantified by using a commercially available ELISA kit
following the instructions from the manufacturer (R&D Systems).
Caspase activation. The activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9
was measured by using the caspase-specific CaspGLOW FITC kit with slight
modifications (MBL International). Briefly, 0.1  106 cells untreated or
treated with omeprazole or esomeprazole were collected and washed once
in PBS. The cells were then resuspended into 100 AL Wash Buffer containing
0.33 AL of the caspase-specific FITC-conjugated peptide and incubated at 37jC
for 60 min. After one wash in wash buffer, the cells were analyzed by FACS.
Detection of reactive oxygen species. Analysis of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production was evaluated on 0.25  106 cells at different time
points after PPI treatments. The cells were incubated with 10 Amol/L
dihydroethidium for 10 min at 37jC and analyzed by FACS. Hydrohetidine
is a membrane-permeable dye that is oxidized in the presence of ROS and
binds to double-stranded DNA, thus giving a deep red fluorescence detected
in the FL3 channel.
Evaluation of cytosolic pH. The effects of PPI on cytosolic pH was
evaluated by flow cytometry using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe BCECFAM (Molecular Probes) as previously described (29). About 10  106 cells were
incubated at 37jC for 30 min in 1 mL RPMI containing 20 Amol/L BCECF-AM.
The cells were then washed in HBSS, placed on ice, and analyzed with a
FACSCalibur equipped with a 488-nm argon laser collecting the emission
of BCECF-AM in the FL1 and FL2 channels. The relative cytosolic pH of
individual cells was displayed in the two-dimensional dot-plot showing their
fluorescence intensity at 520 nm (FL1, base) and 640 nm (FL2, acid) as described
in details previously (29, 30). The BCECF-AM loaded cells were incubated
with different potassium phosphate buffers in a range of pH from 5.5 to 7.5 in
the presence of nigericin (10 Amol/L) to obtain a calibration curve (29).
Analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential. The status of the
mitochondrial membrane potential (DW) was evaluated by using the JC-1
probe (Molecular Probes). Cells were stained with 10 Amol/L JC-1 for 15 min
at 37jC and then immediately transferred on ice and analyzed by FACS (31).
Western blot analysis. Cytosolic and mitochondria-enriched cellular
fractions were isolated from 5  106 Nalm-6 cells treated or not with
omeprazole (200 Amol/L) by using the Q-Proteome Cell Compartment kit
(Qiagen). SDS-PAGE was done on acrylamide gels (12%) loading 20 Ag of
subcellular fraction per lane. After electrophoresis, the proteins resolved on the
gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blocked overnight with
5% dry milk in PBS. Apoptosis-inducting factor (AIF) and cytochrome c were
detected with a rabbit anti-AIF (1:1,000; BD PharMingen) and mouse anticytochrome c (1:1,000; BD PharMingen) followed by specific horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody staining was visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). To assess the presence on the filter
of a comparable amount of proteins, the blots were stripped to detect actin.
Tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Four- to
5-week-old female CB.17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID/SCID)
mice (Harlan) were used and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions

according to our institutional guidelines. Each mouse was injected s.c. in
the right flank with 4  106 Raji cells resuspended in 0.2 mL RPMI 1640.
When tumors appeared (f20 days after injection), omeprazole resuspended in saline was orally administered at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg for six times
with 1-day interval, whereas mice in the control group were treated with
saline. Tumor weight was measured every 6 days with calipers and
estimated with the following formula: tumor weight (grams) = length (mm)
 width2 (mm) / 2. The experiment was interrupted when tumor mass
exceeded 10% of total body weight, and all experimental procedures were
carried out according to the United Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on
Cancer Research guidelines.

Statistical analysis. Differences between groups or treatments were
analyzed by Student’s t test, and the statistically significant differences were
defined only when P < 0.05. Means and SDs were calculated from at least
three independent experiments.

Results
PPI pretreatment increases pre-B ALL cell line sensitivity to
vinblastine. We previously reported that 24 h of omeprazole
pretreatment induced sensitivity of various human tumor cell lines
to chemotherapeutics (24). Here, we tested whether pretreatment

with omeprazole and esomeprazole was able to increase the
sensitivity of a B-cell leukemia (Nalm-6), already sensitive to
cytotoxic effect of vinblastine, commonly used in the treatment of
ALL (32). Because PPI need an acidic pH to be protonated and
activated (33), we evaluated the effect of omeprazole and
esomeprazole in unbuffered culture conditions to allow cells
spontaneously acidify the culture medium. Indeed, whereas the pH
of a buffered medium decreased from 7.7 F 0.1 to 7.4 F 0.2 after
24 h in culture (0.3 pH units), the pH of unbuffered medium
changed from 7.2 F 0.1 to 6.5 F 0.2 (0.7 pH units), thus providing
the acidic conditions for a better activation of the PPI. Cell viability
and growth were not affected in these conditions (data not shown).
Nalm-6 cells were pretreated with PPI (13 Amol/L) for 24 h and
then treated with increasing doses of vinblastine, and after 3 days,
cell viability was evaluated by FACS analysis of cells stained with
trypan blue. At this dose, omeprazole and esomeprazole pretreatment was not toxic to the cells per se but significantly increased
the sensitivity of Nalm-6 cells to the cytotoxicity induced by

www.aacrjournals.org

vinblastine (Supplementary Fig. S1), significantly reducing the IC50
for vinblastine (P < 0.01). We observed that this effect was
detectable also after 8 h of pretreatment with PPI (data not shown)
and was comparable with the ability of PPI to increase vinblastine
sensitivity of CEM cells previously reported by us (24).
PPI inhibit proliferation and affect viability of human B-cell
lines. We reported that low-dose PPI induces alterations of pH
gradients of tumor cells without affecting cell viability (5, 24).
Because proper regulation of cellular pH gradients is crucial for cell
homeostasis (34), we evaluated whether PPI treatment affected
viability and proliferation of human B-cell tumors in vitro. Because
we observed that a more acidic pH of unbuffered medium may
better activate PPI, we measured the proliferation of human B-cell
lines in buffered and unbuffered culture medium in presence of
PPI. Omeprazole induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell
proliferation in both leukemia and lymphoma B cells (Fig. 1A), with
similar results observed for esomeprazole (data not shown). As
expected, the concentration of omeprazole inducing a 50%

Figure 3. PPI induce early destabilization
of lysosomal-like vesicles and cellular pH
gradients. Nalm-6 cells were cultured in
unbuffered medium without PPI (black

were measured by FACS analysis of cells
stained with LysoSensor Green DND-189

described in Materials and Methods.

induced by omeprazole (200 Amol/L) was
evaluated in Nalm-6 cells treated for
48 h and loaded with the pH-sensitive

population in the region R2 contains cells
with a more acidic intracellular pH as
indicated by a lower FL1/FL2 ratio. All
experiments were run twice, and similar
results were obtained for Raji and
Daudi cells.

reduction of cell proliferation was lower in unbuffered compared with
buffered culture conditions (57.3 F 4.5 versus 86.2 F 6.2 Amol/L,
P = 0.01).
To test whether the antiproliferative effect was dependent on
PPI-induced cytotoxicity, PPI were added to the cultures 1 day after
plating the cells, and viability was measured 24 and 48 h after by
FACS analysis of trypan blue–stained cells. We found that
omeprazole and esomeprazole (data not shown) induced a timeand dose-dependent decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1B), with a slight
difference in sensitivity among the three cell lines, reflecting the
data of the proliferation experiments.
PPI induce a caspase-independent, apoptotic-like cell death
in human B-cell lines. To investigate the mechanisms leading to
loss of cell viability, we tested membrane integrity and the presence
of phosphatidylserine residues on the outer membrane as markers
of apoptotic cells. PPI-induced cell death measured after 48 h was
characterized by the presence of Annexin V–positive cells (Fig. 2A),
which was detectable 24 h after treatment with the appearance of
Annexin V+/PI cells (data not shown), indicating the activation of
an apoptotic pathway. In line with this observation, nuclear
fragmentation was observed 48 h after treatment (data not shown).
The PPI-induced apoptosis was dose dependent (Fig. 2B) and
observed in all the B-cell lines tested (Fig. 2C).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

To evaluate the contribution of active caspases in PPI-induced
apoptosis, we evaluated the percentage of cells carrying activated
caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and found that the presence of
activated caspases in Nalm-6 cells was detected in about 50% of
cells 48 h after treatment (Fig. 2D), with similar results obtained on
Raji and Daudi cells (data not shown). However, caspase inhibition
through the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, while decreasing
Fas-mediated apoptosis in Raji cells, had no effect on PPI-induced
cytotoxicity of both Raji and Nalm-6 cells (Fig. 2E), suggesting that
activated caspases are not instrumental for PPI-induced apoptosis
in B-cell tumors. In line with this and previous observations (35),
apoptosis induced by Bafilomycin A1 on B cells was also caspase
independent (data not shown). As previously reported (36), PPIinduced apoptosis in Jurkat cells was caspase dependent (Fig. 3E),
suggesting that a different pathway is responsible for the
cytotoxicity of PPI in B-cell tumors.
PPI induce early lysosomal membrane permeabilization in
human B-cell lines. Mechanisms controlling the pH of intracellular organelles seem to have a pivotal role in maintaining cell
homeostasis and in regulating cell death (34). Low-dose PPI (2.5–
13 Amol/L) affects pH gradients in solid tumor cell lines (24). Here,
we analyzed the long-term effects of a wide range of PPI
concentrations (0–200 Amol/L) on intracellular vesicles pH in

human B-cell lines. Lysosensor staining showed that PPI induced a
dose-dependent alkalinization of intracellular acidic compartments
(Fig. 3A), detectable already 8 h after treatment (Fig. 3B). Staining
with acridine orange and LysoTracker Green showed that a
decreased fluorescence intensity was also observed 8 h after
treatment with PPI (Fig. 3C and D). Altogether, these findings
clearly indicated that PPI induce early alterations in the lysosomal
compartment consisting of lysosomal pH alkalinization and
lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP).
Because cathepsins localize in lysosomes and may be used as
markers of lysosomal membrane disruption (27), we analyzed a
possible involvement of cathepsins in the PPI-induced apoptosis.
We observed that lysosomal membrane rupture occurred very late
in the process (48 h after PPI treatment) as shown by fluorescence
analysis of cathepsin B and D intracellular localization (Supplementary Fig. S2). Consistent with these late events, inhibition of
cathepsins B and D did not affect the PPI-mediated cytotoxicity.
Acidification of cytosolic pH occurs in PPI-induced cell
death. It has been reported that the acidification of cytosolic pH
precedes apoptosis of leukemia/lymphoma cells (37, 38). Because
PPI may inhibit one of the crucial mechanism regulating cellular pH,
we analyzed the changes in the cytosolic pH following PPI treatment
in Nalm-6 cells up to 48 h. We found that after 24 h of PPI treatment,
the cytosolic pH of PPI-treated cells was 7.12 F 0.04, whereas the
cytosolic pH of control cells was 7.21 F 0.01. As reported in Fig. 3E,
48 h of PPI treatment induced the appearance of a population of cells
with acidic cytosolic pH (6.21 F 0.03 versus 7.30 F 0.01). In the PPItreated samples, the cells characterized by a decreased FL1/FL2
ratio (indicating an acidic cytosolic pH) were identified by forward
and side light scatter as apoptotic cells (data not shown), suggesting
that cytosolic acidification and cell shrinkage were associated.
Mitochondrial membrane depolarization occurs in PPIinduced cell death. The lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway
mediates cell death induced by different stimuli, including
lysosomotropic agents (27, 39, 40). Thus, we evaluated the effects

of PPI treatment on mitochondrial membrane potential (DW). All
B-cell lines were treated for 2 days with PPI (50–200 Amol/L), and
changes in DW were analyzed after 8, 24, and 48 h. The
depolarization of DW was detected only after 24 h of treatment
(Fig. 4A), with the presence of a cell population with an
intermediate DW (top right quadrant), representing early apoptotic
cells (31), and a proportion of cells with a collapsed DW (bottom
right quadrant), representing late apoptotic cells. Moreover,
accurate FACS analysis done on the gate of live cells (according
to morphologic variables) showed similar results. The effects of PPI
on mitochondrial function was also shown by the release of
cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol 24 h after addition
of PPI, as shown by ELISA and Western blot (Fig. 4B and C). The
permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane was further
shown by the partial release of AIF from mitochondria and the
accumulation of AIF in the cytosolic fraction after 48 h, suggesting
the involvement of AIF in the execution of the apoptotic process.
PPI-mediated cell death occurs via ROS-dependent mechanisms. Because ROS generation plays an important role in caspaseindependent apoptosis (27, 41), we investigated whether ROS
generation was required for triggering the lysosomal-mitochondrial
cell death pathway. First, we observed that PPI (also at suboptimal
doses like 50 Amol/L) induced a very early production of ROS
detectable in the whole cell population within 4 h after treatment
(Fig. 5A, top), and preincubation of PPI-treated cultures with the
ROS scavenger NAC (5 mmol/L) totally abolished the PPI-mediated
production of ROS (Fig. 5A, bottom) and significantly inhibited the
cytotoxicity of PPI (Fig. 5B). This process was accompanied by a
stabilization of the lysosomal membrane assessed by acridine
orange staining (Fig. 5C) and by a reduction in the population of
cells with a collapsed DW (Fig. 5D), thus suggesting an important
role of ROS in PPI-induced apoptosis.
PPI are cytotoxic for leukemic cells from patients with pre-B
ALL. Because PPI exhibited a clear cytotoxic effect on human
B-cell tumors in vitro, we investigated whether such cytotoxicity

could also be observed ex vivo in bone marrow–derived leukemic
cells isolated from pre-B ALL patients. Bone marrow cells were
cultured in unbuffered medium in the presence of increasing
concentrations of omeprazole, and apoptosis was measured after
2 days. We found that omeprazole induced a clear and dosedependent cytotoxicity in all samples tested (Fig. 6A). Omeprazole
concentrations of 100 and 200 Amol/L induced cell death in the
ALL cells ranging between 28.8 F 5.0% and 62.6 F 9.6%, with a
significant increase compared with baseline cell death of untreated
controls (11.6 F 1.9%, P < 0.001). Conversely, PPI had no toxic
effect on MDM isolated from healthy subjects (Fig. 6B).
In vivo antitumoral effects of PPI treatment. The antitumoral activity of PPI was evaluated in vivo in the SCID mouse
tumor growth model. Because the doses of PPI used in vitro
exceed the serum concentrations of PPI thus far reported in
human studies, we decided to use a dose of omeprazole
comparable with the doses used in in vivo studies (2.5 mg/kg;
ref. 42). Control mice (n = 7) received saline, whereas treated
mice (n = 7) received six doses of omeprazole, with 1-day interval
and tumor growth was estimated during the follow-up. The
growth of Raji tumors in mice treated with omeprazole was

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

significantly reduced compared with control animals (Fig. 6C),
and the size of PPI-treated tumors was significantly smaller than
control tumors at follow-up (P = 0.01), indicating that PPI
treatment may exert an antineoplastic activity in vivo.

Discussion
During the last decade, it has become evident that tumors hijack
basic homeostatic cellular functions to progress towards malignancy. Such functions are involved in the control of cell proliferation, invasion capacity, and resistance to antitumoral treatments.
An important function involved in malignant progression is the
pH regulation, whose activity is abnormal in tumors. Such selective
advantage is conferred to tumor cells by the capacity of surviving
in hypoxic-acidic environment, mediated by the up-regulated lysosomal trafficking and proton extrusion activity (3–5, 43). In fact,
whereas the extracellular pH of normal tissues is neutral, the interstitial pH of tumors is acidic, and because of this feature, tumor cells
are characterized by two pH gradients: that between the cytosol and
the extracellular matrix and the one between the cytosol and the
lumen of intracellular vesicles (5). To avoid intracellular acidification

PPI as Antineoplastic Drugs for Human B-Cell Tumors

under such conditions, tumor cells have an increased activity of
pH regulators, including the V-ATPase (44). In agreement with the
effects of PPI on the endo-lysosomal compartment, we previously
reported that decreasing the pH gradients in tumor cells through
PPI may revert chemoresistance and increase chemosensitivity of
different human tumor cells, including a T-cell leukemia line (24, 45).

In fact, we confirmed in this study that PPI pretreatment of the
human pre-B ALL cell line Nalm-6 significantly increased the
sensitivity to vinblastine, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent
in ALL. In addition, we found that also a short preincubation time
(8 h) with PPI was sufficient to observe this effect.
It has been suggested that targeting mechanisms allowing
tumors to survive in acidic/hypoxic conditions may represent a
novel strategy to combat cancer (34). PPI could represent a class of
drugs suitable to this purpose. In fact, being the V-ATPase one of
their targets, PPI may revert the pH gradients of tumor cells.
Moreover, PPI are commonly administered to millions of subjects
affected by peptic diseases, with minimal side effects and few drug
interactions (19, 20). Consistently, omeprazole did not inhibit
functions of human macrophages and lymphocytes in long-term
treated patients (46). We know that PPI are weak bases, and the
active protonated form of the drug will necessarily accumulate into
acidic compartments (33). In fact, in healthy subjects, PPI mostly
target the stomach, being the most acidic site of the body.
Therefore, it seemed conceivable that PPI may specifically get to
the tumor site, being an additional acidic compartment in cancer
patients. We reasoned that any effect of PPI on tumor cells in vitro
would be potentiated by the degree of acidity of the surrounding
microenvironment, as already shown for its antimicrobial activity
(47, 48). Indeed, although the doses at which PPI induced cell death
in vitro are higher than plasma concentrations reached in humans
at standard dosage, we believe that PPI may achieve higher local
concentrations at tumor site. This may be true also in the case of
hematologic malignancies with massive blast proliferation in
acidic/hypoxic environment like the bone marrow. In fact, PPI
showed a dose-dependent effect on cell viability inducing an
apoptotic-like cell death in both human B-cell lines and bone
marrow–derived leukemic blasts of pre-B ALL patients, without
any significant effect on human MDM. In addition, in vivo
treatment with PPI of Raji tumors injected into SCID mice
significantly delayed tumor growth. Our observation supports data
reporting that inhibition of V-ATPase activity by small interfering
RNA delay tumor growth in vivo (15), and that pharmacologic
inhibitors of V-ATPase induce cell death in B-cell lymphoma (14).
Consistent with the hypothesis that because of the acidic pH of
tumors, PPI may find a specific delivery to tumors rather than
normal tissues, the antineoplastic effect of PPI was always stronger
in unbuffered rather than buffered culture conditions, as supported
by measurements of extracellular pH in cells cultured in the
buffered and unbuffered conditions. This suggests that leaving
tumor cells spontaneously acidify their environment markedly
increases PPI activation due to acidity.
The apoptotic-like process induced by PPI involved the activation
of different caspases whose role is, however, not instrumental. In
fact, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit PPImediated apoptosis in B-cell tumors, whereas it was able to inhibit
apoptosis of Jurkat cells, confirming a previous report (36) and
suggesting that PPI may act on B-cell tumors by a different
mechanism. It is known that LMP induced by quinolone antibiotics
triggers caspase-independent cell death through mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization (MMP; ref. 27). In addition, the
synthetic retinoid CD437 and a polyamine oxidase inhibitor induce
apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells through lysosomotropic
effects in a caspase-independent manner despite the presence of
activated caspases (39, 40). We found that B-cell lines treated with
PPI were characterized by early lysosomal alterations, detected as
increased intraluminal pH and reduced membrane stability within

8 h after treatment. This effect was amplified during the following
days, when also a destabilization of lysosomal vesicles content was
shown by analysis of lysosomal markers like cathepsins B and D
and Lamp-1 (data not shown). However, inhibition analysis of
cathepsins activity showed no protection against PPI-induced cell
death in B-cell lines (data not shown), indicating that PPI may lead
to the simultaneous activation of different cell death pathways,
most likely triggered by the profound disruption of cellular pH
gradients. Interestingly, we found that mitochondrial membrane
depolarization and release of cytochrome c occurred before the
activation of caspases and after LMP, suggesting that PPI-induced
cell death may follow the lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway. In
addition, PPI caused the mitochondrial release of the caspaseindependent death effector AIF. The importance of lysosomes in
the apoptotic process was also confirmed by the finding that PPI
induced a very early accumulation of ROS, which was inhibited by
the ROS scavenger NAC. In fact, ROS inhibition by NAC
significantly delayed PPI-induced apoptosis and caused the
stabilization of the lysosomal compartment, in turn resulting in
protection of mitochondria as it occurs in similar apoptotic
pathways (49). Therefore, intracellular ROS generation seems to be
a primary event induced by PPI, likely causing mitochondrial
membrane depolarization, cytosolic release of AIF (and/or other
proteins) from the mitochondria, and then apoptosis (50).
The alteration of the pH gradient between cytosol and lysosomal
vesicles was further amplified by the concomitant acidification of
cytosolic pH following PPI treatment. Interestingly, reduction in
intracellular pH after inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger, another

regulator of cellular pH, has been reported to induce apoptosis of
primary patients’ leukemic cells (37). This suggests that PPI induce
cell death in B-cell tumors by breaking down the fine regulation of
pH gradients, a homeostatic mechanism crucial for survival of
tumor cells. We observed that the Daudi and Nalm-6 cells showed a
higher sensitivity to PPI cytotoxicity compared with Raji cells.
Interestingly, Raji cells had a cytosolic pH of 7.35, which was lower
than that of Daudi and Nalm-6 cells (pH 7.5; data not shown). The
possibility that PPI effects are strictly dependent upon proton
pumps and ROS-generating enzymes is currently under investigation in our laboratory.
This study indicates that PPI induce cell death of human B-cell
tumors through severe alteration of pH gradients regulation,
including ROS production, LMP, and MMP. Clearly, the in vivo
effectiveness of PPI depends on the ability of tumor cells to acidify
their environment, to allow first the drug to target the tumor and
then to be activated in situ. Our study suggests that mechanisms
involved in regulation of cellular pH may represent suitable targets
for novel antitumor strategies and indicates the potential use of
PPI as antineoplastic agents towards human B-cell tumors.
