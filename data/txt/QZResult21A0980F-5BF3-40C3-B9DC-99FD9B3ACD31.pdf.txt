gene (EGFR) status as a predictor of gefitinib efficacy in Japanese patients has
shown promise, the authors evaluated EGFR mutations and gene amplification in
biopsy specimens from Japanese patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) who received treatment with gefitinib to analyze the correlation
between EGFR gene status and clinical outcome.

METHODS. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. EGFR gene amplification was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and EGFR mutations in exons 18, 19, and 21 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and
direct sequencing.
RESULTS. EGFR mutations were detected in 17 patients (28.8%). FISH-positive
results were observed in 26 patients (48.1%). The response rate was significantly

E

pidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that belongs to the ErbB family and has been implicated in
cell proliferation and survival. The EGFR gene (EGFR) frequently is
overexpressed in many solid tumors, including nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC).1 Gefitinib (Iressa; Astra Zeneca) is a targeted agent
that inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR by competitively
blocking the adenosine triphosphate binding site.2 Two Phase II trials
(THE Iressa Dose Evaluation in Advanced Lung Cancer [IDEAL] 1 and
IDEAL 2 studies) confirmed that gefitinib was active in from 10% to

EGFR and Gefitinib in Japanese NSCLC/Sone et al.

20% of patients with NSCLC who had failed on standard therapy,3,4 and both trials revealed significant variability in response to gefitinib. Objective responses to
gefitinib frequently are observed in women, neversmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma histology,3,4 and molecular predictors of response to gefitinib have been investigated. Protein expression of
EGFR and its downstream molecules have been studied widely immunohistochemically, but the results
have not been consistent.5–8
In 2004, 3 groups reported that tumors with somatic mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR were
associated with gefitinib sensitivity.9–11 Several retrospective studies have revealed that EGFR mutations
are observed more frequently in women, never-smokers, patients with adenocarcinoma histology, and
East-Asian patients12–17 and that mutations are associated with objective response to gefitinib and a prolonged time to progression (TTP). A survival benefit of
gefitinib treatment has been observed in many EastAsian patients with EGFR mutations, but no such benefit has been reported in Caucasian patients with
EGFR mutations.7,12,13,15,18,19
Cappuzzo et al. investigated EGFR gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in
patients with NSCLC who received treatment with
gefitinib, and their results indicated that EGFR gene
amplification was associated with an objective
response to gefitinib, a longer TTP, and a longer overall survival (OS).14,18 Those authors also demonstrated
that EGFR gene amplification assessed by FISH was a
more reliable biomarker for predicting a survival benefit of gefitinib therapy in Caucasian patients with
NSCLC than EGFR mutation status. However, it is
unclear whether EGFR gene amplification assessed by
FISH is an effective predictor of gefitinib efficacy in
Japanese patients with NSCLC, who frequently have
EGFR mutations and in whom the mutations seem to
be reliable predictors of gefitinib efficacy. In the current study, we evaluated the EGFR mutation status
and gene amplification in biopsy specimens from Japanese patients with advanced NSCLC to assess their
predictive value in regard to the efficacy of gefitinib in
this population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This was a retrospective study and was conducted at 5
institutions: Kanazawa University Hospital, Ishikawa
Prefectural Central Hospital, Kouseiren Takaoka Hospital, Houju Kinen Hospital, and Kanazawa Municipal
Hospital. Gefitinib therapy in the enrolled patients
was started between July 2002 and October 2005. The

1837

patients were chosen for this study based on the following eligibility criteria: histologically confirmed
NSCLC treated with gefitinib (250 mg per day), the
ability to obtain tumor samples from each institution
after receiving approval from the institution’s review
board and the patient’s written informed consent, and
the ability to obtain complete clinical information
and physical examination records, including information on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS).20
Patients who received treatment with gefitinib
were evaluated for response every 4 weeks according
to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) guidelines.21 Tumor response was assessed
by computed tomography (CT), and a confirmatory
evaluation was repeated after 4 weeks in patients who
had a complete response (CR), a partial response
(PR), or stable disease (SD). TTP was calculated from
the date gefitinib therapy was started to the date of
disease progression or the date of last contact. OS was
calculated from the date gefitinib therapy was started
to the date of death or the most recent date on which
the patient was known to be alive. Some patients in
this study had been enrolled in our previous study,
which was a Phase II trial that evaluated the clinical
benefit of gefitinib in chemotherapy-naive patients
with NSCLC.22 The investigators who examined the
biopsy specimens were blinded to the clinical outcome.

Tissue Preparation
The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections that contained
representative malignant cells were deparaffinized in
xylene washes and dehydrated in 100% ethanol. No
specimens were microdissected.
EGFR Mutations
DNA was extracted from 5 serial, 10-lm-thick sections
by using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the protocol described in the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA obtained was eluted
in 50 lL of buffer AE, and the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA were assessed by spectrophotometry. The extracted DNA was stored at 208C
until it was used. EGFR mutations were detected by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based direct
sequencing of exons 18, 19, and 21. PCR amplification
was performed in 100 ng of genomic DNA with the
TaKaRa Ex Taq Hot Start Version kit (TaKaRa, Tokyo,
Japan). The following primers were used: exon 18, 50 CCTTGTCTCTGTGTTCTTGT-30 (forward) and 50 CTGCGGCCCAGCCCAGAGGC-30 (reverse); exon 19, 50 CATGTGGCACCATCTCACA-30 (forward) and 50 -CCA-

CACAGCAAAGCAGAAAC-30 (reverse); and exon 21, 50 CAGGGTCTTCTCTGTTTCAG-30 (forward) and 50 -TAAAGCCACC TCCTTACTTT-30 (reverse). DNA was amplified for 35 cycles at 958C for 30 seconds, at 618C for
30 seconds, and at 728C for 60 seconds followed by
7 minutes of extension at 728C. Sequencing was performed with a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan), and the results were analyzed by
using Sequencer 3.11 software (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, Calif) to compare variations. The sequences were compared with the GenBank sequence
for human EGFR (accession number AF288738).

EGFR Amplification
Each slide was deparaffinized in xylene washes and
dehydrated in 100% ethanol. After incubation in 0.2 N
HCL at room temperature for 20 minutes and in a pretreatment reagent (NaSCN; Vysis, Tokyo, Japan) at 808C
for 30 minutes, the slides were digested with a proteinase reagent at 378C for 10 to 60 minutes. Slides were
refixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at room temperature for 10 minutes and rinsed twice in
2 3 standard saline citrate (SSC), pH 7.3, at room temperature for 5 minutes each. The slides were incubated
in 70% formamide/2 3 SSC, pH 7.0 to 8.0, at 728C for 5
minutes to allow the chromosomes to denature and
were then dehydrated in a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol solutions (70%, 85%, and 100%). The
EGFR/chromosome 7 centromere (CEP7) probe set
(Vysis) was applied to an area that was selected based
on the presence of tumor foci on each slide, and the
hybridization area was covered with a cover glass and
sealed with rubber cement. The slides were incubated
in a humidified chamber at 378C for 20 to 24 hours
to allow hybridization to occur. A posthybridization
wash was performed in 2 3 SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 738C
for 2 minutes and then in 2 3 SSC at room temperature
for 5 minutes. Finally, 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
was applied to the target area, which then was covered
with a coverslip.
The patients were classified into the following
6 categories according to EGFR gene copy numbers
per cell and frequency of tumor cells with a specific
copy number of the EGFR gene and CEP7, as described18
by Cappuzzo et al.: disomy (2 copies in >90% of
cells), low trisomy (2 copies in 40% of cells, 3
copies in 10–40% of cells, 4 copies in <10% of cells),
high trisomy (2 copies in 40% of cells, 3 copies in
40% of cells, 4 copies in <10% of cells), low polysomy (4 copies in 10–40% of cells), high polysomy
(4 copies in 40% of cells), and high gene copy
number (defined as the presence of tight EGFR gene
clusters and a ratio of EGFR gene to chromosome of
2 copies or 15 copies of EGFR per cell in 10% of

cells) (Fig. 1A-D). FISH analysis was performed independently by 2 investigators who were blinded to the
patients’ clinical characteristics and all other molecular variables. Patients with high polysomy or high
gene copy numbers were classified as FISH-positive,
and the remaining groups (with disomy, low trisomy,
high trisomy, or low polysomy) were classified as
FISH-negative.

Statistical Analysis
Associations between response to gefitinib and other
variables, including sex, histology, smoking history,
EGFR mutations, and EGFR gene amplification, were
analyzed for independence by using the chi-square
test. A logistic regression model was used to identify
which independent factors had a joint significant
influence on the rate of objective response to gefitinib.
TTP and OS were calculated by using the KaplanMeier method, and differences between patient groups
according to EGFR mutations or FISH analysis were
compared by using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used for the multivariate
analysis of survival. A P value of .05 was regarded as
statistically significant, unless stated otherwise, and
all comparisons were 2-sided. StatView 5.0 statistical
software was used to perform all analyses.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. Tumor samples were collected from 59 patients.
We were able to obtain complete clinical information
on 101 patients with NSCLC who received treatment
with gefitinib at the 5 institutions. It was impossible
to obtain tumor samples from 37 of 101 patients;
because, in 22 patients, the diagnosis was made cytologically, and the 15 other patients already had been
diagnosed at other hospitals before their admission to
1 of our institutions. Response to gefitinib was not
evaluated in 5 patients, because they did not have
lesions that could be evaluated.
In total, 59 tumor samples, 46 from primary
tumors (29 obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy, 3
obtained by percutaneous lung biopsy, and 14
obtained at surgery) and 13 samples from lung tumor
metastases to other sites (5 in lymph nodes, 5 in the
brain, 1 in the small bowel, 1 in bone, and 1 in muscle) were obtained. All resections were performed for
histologic diagnosis or palliative therapy. Twenty-four
of 59 patients (40.7%) were women, and 21 patients
(35.0%) were never-smokers. According to histologic
type, there were 44 adenocarcinomas (73.3%; including 2 that contained bronchioloalveolar carcinoma

components), 11 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 large
cell carcinomas, and 1 adenosquamous cell carcinoma. Thirty-six patients (61.0%) had a good PS (0 or
1). Fifty-four patients (91.5%) had stage IV disease at
the start of gefitinib therapy.
Twenty-five patients had been treated with chemotherapy, and 34 patients were chemotherapy-naive. A
PR was achieved in 16 patients (27.1%), 20 patients
had SD (33.9%), and 23 patients had progressive disease (PD) (39.0%). The overall response rate was
27.1% (95% confidence interval, 15.8–38.5%), and the
response rate was significantly higher among women,
patients with adenocarcinoma, and never-smokers
(Table 1).
Fifteen patients were alive at the time of the analysis, and 5 of those patients still were receiving gefitinib therapy without tumor progression. The median
follow-up was 9.9 months, the median TTP was 3.1
months (range, 0.2–34.8 months), and the median OS

was 7.6 months (range, 0.7–38.8 months). The median
duration of gefitinib therapy was 3.5 months. The TTP
and OS were significantly longer among women (TTP:
4.3 months vs 1.1 months; P ¼ .0084; OS: 18.2 months
vs 6.4 months; P ¼ .0022), among patients with adenocarcinoma (TTP: 3.7 months vs 1.1 months; P ¼ .0024;
OS: 10.2 months vs 6.1 months; P ¼ .0025), and
among never-smokers (TTP: 6.5 months vs 3.3
months; P ¼ .0013; OS: 18.2 months vs 6.1 months;
P ¼ .0003). There were no differences in TTP or OS
between patients who received gefitinib as first-line
therapy and patients who received gefitinib as second-line therapy (TTP, 3.3 months vs 2.6 months,
respectively; P ¼ .3287; OS: 8.2 months vs 6.2 months,
respectively; P ¼ .2689).

EGFR Mutations
EGFR mutations of exons 18, 19, and 21 were analyzed

EGFR Mutations and Gene Amplification As Predictors
of Gefitinib Efficacy
The response rate among patients with EGFR mutations was significantly higher than the response rate
among patients without mutations (58.8% vs 14.3%;
P ¼ .0005) (Table 1), but there was little difference in
the response rate between FISH-positive patients and
FISH-negative patients (30.8% vs 21.4%, respectively;
P ¼ .4339) (Table 1). A multivariate analysis of response to gefitinib that included the variables sex, histology, smoking status, and EGFR gene status revealed
that EGFR mutation was the only factor that contributed significantly toward a response to gefitinib
(P ¼ .0196) (Table 4).

TTP and OS were significantly longer in patients
with EGFR mutations than in patients without EGFR
mutations (TTP: 7.3 months vs 1.8 months; P ¼ .0030)
(Fig. 2A) (OS: 18.9 months vs 6.4 months; P ¼ .0092)
(Fig. 2B), but no significant difference in the median
TTP or OS was observed between FISH-positive
patients and FISH-negative patients (TTP: 1.8 months
vs 2.6 months, respectively; P ¼ .8535) (Fig. 2C) (OS:

(Fig. 2D). Five variables (sex, histology, smoking status, EGFR mutation, and EGFR FISH-positive results)
were included in a Cox hazards model to define which
variables were predictive of longer survival. The
results showed that EGFR mutation was the only factor associated with both longer TTP and longer OS
(Table 4). The median OS of patients with mutations
in exon 21 was longer than of patients with exon 19
deletion mutations (23.0 months vs 18.2 months;
P ¼ .0271), but there was no difference in response
rate or TTP between patients with mutations in exon
19 and patients with mutations in exon 21 (response
rate: 60.0% vs 58.3%, respectively; P ¼ .9493; TTP:
8.3 months vs 6.4 months, respectively; P ¼ .5158).
TTP and OS were significantly longer in the 10 responders with mutations than in the 6 responders without
mutations (TTP: 15.3 months vs 3.3 months;

predictor of gefitinib efficacy than sex, histology,
smoking status, or EGFR gene amplification. All
biopsy specimens were examined successfully for
EGFR mutations, and the results were comparable

was limited. The results suggested that gefitinib efficacy in Japanese patients with NSCLC can be predicted by detecting EGFR mutations in biopsy
specimens.
Several recent studies produced higher response
rates in patients with mutations in exon 19 of EGFR
than in patients with L858R in exon 21 and demonstrated that TTP and OS were longer in patients with
the deletion than in the patients with L858R.23,24 However, our current results showed no difference in
response or TTP between patients with exon 19 mutations and patients with exon 21 mutations, and patients
with the L858R point mutation in exon 21 had a longer
median OS than patients with a point mutation in exon
19. We cannot explain why our results were not in line
with the those obtained in previous studies.23,24 Our
study was not designed investigate the differences in
gefitinib efficacy between patients with mutations in
exon 19 and patients with mutations in exon 21, and
the sample size of the study was too small to detect a
statistically significant difference.
The small number of patients is a clear limitation
of this study. A large-scale, single-arm study of Western NSCLC reported that both EGFR mutations and
gene amplification were associated with response rate
to gefitinib, longer TTP, and longer OS, and that study
also demonstrated a significant correlation between

FISH-positive results and the presence of EGFR mutations in paired specimens.18 Results from samples in
prospective, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies
were published subsequently, and the usefulness of
EGFR gene amplification as a predictor of gefitinib efficacy was validated in a Phase III, placebo-controlled
study, the Iressa Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer
(ISEL) trial.25 The results of that prospective study
indicated that high EGFR gene copy numbers were a
predictor of a better response to gefitinib and a survival benefit.26 The results from the current study conflict with the results from the ISEL trial and do not
demonstrate any association between gene amplification and the efficacy of gefitinib therapy.
One possible explanation for the discrepancies
between findings from the studies described above
and our own findings is the difference in EGFR gene
status according to ethnicity. Han et al. investigated
EGFR gene mutations, gene amplification, K-ras
mutation, and Akt phosphorylation in tumor samples
from East-Asian patients with NSCLC27 and demonstrated that EGFR mutation was an independent predictor of response and survival in a multivariate
analysis that included EGFR gene amplification. Those
authors also demonstrated that FISH-positive results
were associated with a better response rate the same
as EGFR mutation in the univariate analysis but was

EGFR and Gefitinib in Japanese NSCLC/Sone et al.

not associated with prolonged survival. Previous studies have shown an approximately 3 times higher
incidence of EGFR mutations in East Asians than in
Caucasians.7,9–12,16,17,19,21,28–30 FISH-positive results
do not appear to contribute significantly to the response to gefitinib or to survival in populations with
high percentages of EGFR mutations.
The incidence of L858R in our study seemed
low compared with the incidence of exon 19 deletion.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the incidence of deletion mutations in exon 19 is almost the
same as the incidence of point mutations in exon
21.7,9–12,16,17,19,21,28–30 Because the direct sequencing
method usually was used to detect EGFR mutations, it
is unlikely that the low frequency of the L858R mutation was caused by assay-related, false-negative findings. Our results of the incidence of L858R mutation
and exon 19 deletion mutations may also produce
some distortion with regard to the analysis of gene
copy numbers because the number of patients with
high gene copy numbers has been observed to be
higher in those with deletion mutations in exon 19
than with point mutations in exon 21. Further analyses in much larger groups of patients will be necessary
to clarify the frequency of the 2 most common
mutations.
Takano et al. demonstrated an association between increased EGFR copy numbers measured by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) and both higher a response
rate and longer TTP.15 Dziadziuszko et al. reported
that EGFR messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in tumor samples measured by qPCR was a predictive biomarker for response to gefitinib and longer progressionfree survival. Those investigators also demonstrated
that EGFR mRNA expression measured by qPCR was
correlated significantly with FISH-positive results.31 It
is possible that qPCR may enable us to make a more
reliable distinction between specific and nonspecific
amplification of the EGFR gene.13 We plan to compare
EGFR gene copy numbers in corresponding samples
measured with qPCR to confirm our results. We classified all patients into a FISH-positive group and a
FISH-negative group according to the scoring system
published by Cappuzzo et al. EGFR gene copy numbers also may vary according to ethnicity, similar to
the differences in EGFR mutation frequency. The definition of FISH-positive results may need to be modified to use it as a predictor of gefitinib efficacy in
Japanese patients with NSCLC.
In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that the presence of EGFR mutations detected in
biopsy specimens is an independent and significant
predictor of response to gefitinib and survival in Japanese patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the

1843

role of EGFR gene amplification was not identified as
a predictor of gefitinib efficacy in Japanese patients.
Precise measurements are needed, and the validity of
the classification must be confirmed in a prospective
study.
