ABSTRACT
The BCL6 oncogene plays a crucial role in sustaining diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBCL) through transcriptional repression of key checkpoint genes.
BCL6-targeted therapy kills lymphoma cells by releasing these checkpoints.
However BCL6 also directly represses several DLBCL oncogenes such as BCL2
and BCL-XL that promote lymphoma survival. Herein we show that DLBCL cells
that survive BCL6-targeted therapy induce a phenomenon of “oncogene-addiction
switching” by reactivating BCL2-family dependent anti-apoptotic pathways. Thus,
most DLBCL cells require concomitant inhibition of BCL6 and BCL2-family members
for effective lymphoma killing. Moreover, in DLBCL cells initially resistant to BH3
mimetic drugs, BCL6 inhibition induces a newly developed reliance on anti-apoptotic
BCL2-family members for survival that translates in acquired susceptibility to BH3
mimetic drugs ABT-737 and obatoclax. In germinal center B cell-like (GCB)-DLBCL
cells, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the NEDD inhibitor MLN4924 posttranscriptionally activated the BH3-only sensitizer NOXA thus counteracting the
oncogenic switch to BCL2 induced by BCL6-targeting. Hence our study indicates that
BCL6 inhibition induces an on-target feedback mechanism based on the activation
of anti-apoptotic BH3 members. This oncogene-addition switching mechanism was
harnessed to develop rational combinatorial therapies for GCB-DLBCL.

and functional studies provided the basis and rationale
for development of BCL6 inhibitors [2, 3]. The specific
and highly active BCL6 inhibitor RI-BPI was shown to
disrupt the interaction of BCL6 with critical co-repressor
complexes [2]. The principal effect of RI-BPI on DLBCL
cells is rapid induction of cell death [2, 6]. Apoptosis
is typically observed within 24 hours, and occurs in
large part because BCL6 inhibitors release from BCL6mediated transcriptional repression a variety of cell
death checkpoint effectors and modulator genes such as
ATR, GADD45G, TP53, BAT3 and EP300 [1, 2, 6]. It is
likely the combinatorial effect of multiple simultaneous
checkpoint gene reactivations delivers an ultimate death
signal to lymphoma cells.

INTRODUCTION
BCL6 is required for the survival of diffuse large
B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) [1–3]. This property
derives from its normal function in the humoral immune
system, where enables the survival of germinal center
(GC) B cells. BCL6 represses replication checkpoint
and DNA damage sensor genes, thereby allowing GC
B cells to proliferate and tolerate the DNA damage that
occurs during immunoglobulin affinity maturation.
[4]. The checkpoint suppression properties of BCL6
are inherently pro-oncogenic and accordingly BCL6 is
expressed in DLBCLs [5]. Thus inhibiting BCL6 is a
potential strategy to treat these lymphomas. Biochemical

However, BCL6 also represses several prominent
B-cell oncogenes including BCL2, MYC, BMI1,
NFKB1, JUNB and EIF4E [7–9], likely as a way to
counterbalance its own powerful oncogenic actions in
GC B cells [10]. BCL2 promoter mutations occurring
in a sub-set of DLBCLs enable release from BCL6mediated repression [7]. Nevertheless, in many
DLBCLs, BCL2 is normally silenced by BCL6, which
may cooperate with MIZ1 to repress this locus [11].
From a BCL6 targeted therapeutic approach, this
could have the unintended effect of concomitantly
inducing pro-survival factors enabling at least a subset
of lymphoma cells to survive exposure to RI-BPI or
other BCL6 targeted therapies. Acquired resistance
mechanisms have been recently described for targeted
therapies affecting signal transduction such as EGFRinhibitors [12] and VEGF-inhibitors [13]. Herein we
show that such on-target feedback mechanisms may
also occur in the context of transcription factor targeted
therapy, in this case in GCB-DLBCL cells treated with
BCL6 targeted therapy. However this undesired effect
could nonetheless provide an opportunity for designing
improved treatments. In particular we show that
targeting BCL6 feedback mechanisms involving BCL2family members can improve the efficacy of BCL6targeted therapy and serve as the basis for development
of rationally designed combinatorial regimens for GCBDLBCLs.

whereas ABT-737 killed 57% of cells transfected with
control siRNA. However, ABT-737 caused 97% loss of
viability in cells transfected with BCL6 siRNA (p < 0.03,
T-test, Figures 1C and S1B), suggesting that BCL2 and
BCL-XL upregulation and function may partially protect
GCB-DLBCL cells after BCL6 inhibition.
This result prompted us to test whether therapeutic
targeting of BCL6 using specific inhibitors might also
induce these survival feedback proteins. RI-BPI is a
BCL6 inhibitor under development for clinical use that
disrupts the ability of BCL6 to recruit BTB-dependent corepressor proteins SMRT, NCoR and BCoR [1]. We first
determined that RI-BPI induces a similar upregulation of
BCL2 and BCL-XL transcripts in OCI-Ly1 cells to BCL6
knockdown, but as early as 12 h after its administration
(Figure 1D). Then, to determine whether basal expression
of these anti-apoptotic feedback proteins would influence
the effect of BCL6 inhibitors, we exposed a panel of
22 DLBCL cell lines to RI-BPI. Thirteen cell lines
exhibited a RI-BPI GI50 lower than 20 μM after 48 h
exposure and were considered to be RI-BPI responsive
(i.e. BCL6-dependent; Figure 1E). The cut-off for RIBPI sensitivity in vitro was extrapolated based on RI-BPI
pharmacokinetic data in rats (Table S1). RI-BPI sensitivity
did not correlate with C.O.O. classification in ABC vs.
GCB or with presence of BCL6 and/or BCL2 translocation
or amplification (Fig. S2A). Baseline expression of antiapoptotic BCL2, BCL2A1, BCL2L1 (BCL-XL), BCL2L2
(BCL-W) and MCL1, or pro-apoptotic PMAIP1 (NOXA),
BAK1, BAX, BID, BIK, BAD, BMF, BBC3 (PUMA) and
HRK members was similar between RI-BPI resistant and
sensitive cell lines (T-test, Figure 1F). Moreover, pretreatment of BCL6-independent GCB-DLBCL cell line
OCI-Ly4 with ABT-737 failed to sensitize them to RI-BPI
(Fig. S2B), suggesting that BCL2 function is not involved
in conferring baseline sensitivity to RI-BPI.

RESULTS
BCL2-family members protect DLBCL cells
from loss of BCL6 function
Although BCL6 is known to repress tumor
checkpoint genes to support lymphoma cell growth, it
could also directly repress BCL2 and BCL2L1 (BCLXL)[7]. Hence in addition to restoring death inducing
checkpoint proteins, targeting BCL6 might at the same
time enable their survival through an on-target feedback
mechanism consisting on up-regulation of pro-survival
oncogenes. To explore this question we performed BCL6
loss of function experiments in the GCB-DLBCL cell
line OCI-Ly1 using siRNA sequences (Fig. S1A). BCL6
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated
that BCL6 directly binds BCL2 and BCL2L1 gene
promoters (Figure 1A), and that this binding decreases
upon BCL6 knockdown with siRNA (Figure 1A).
Consequently, BCL6 knockdown transcriptionally induces
BCL2 and BCL-XL expression (Figure 1B). To test
whether up-regulation of BCL2 and BCL-XL might cause
lymphoma cells to become especially dependent on these
pathways for survival in the absence of BCL6, we knocked
down BCL6 in OCI-Ly1 cells as before and treated with
the BCL2 and BCL-XL inhibitor ABT-737 250 nM for
72 h. BCL6 knockdown induced 68% loss of viability,

Combination with BH3 mimetics enhances
response of DLBCL cells to BCL6 inhibitor
To identify cells that are dependent on both BCL6
and BCL2 for survival, we first defined the spectrum of
activity of BH3 mimetic inhibitors ABT-737 and obatoclax
in our panel of 13 BCL6-dependent cell lines. We then
plotted ABT-737 and obatoclax GI50s with RI-BPI GI50s,
to identify cell lines sensitive to both class of drugs (i.e.
BCL6 and BCL2 dependent) (Figure 2A). The GCBDLBCL cell lines SU-DHL6, SC-1, DoHH2 and SU-DHL4
were sensitive to both BH3 mimetic inhibitors ABT-737
and obatoclax (Figure 2A), therefore were considered as
BCL2 dependent. ABT-737 inhibits preferentially BCL2,
BCL-XL and BCL-W, whereas obatoclax was reported
to also inhibit MCL1. Although we characterized BCL2
and BCL-XL as direct BCL6 target genes, secondary
mechanisms could lead to up-regulation of the other
anti-apoptotic BH3 members and influence the response

to these drugs. In fact, transcriptional analysis of RI-BPI
effect in double sensitive cell lines SU-DHL6, DoHH2
and SC-1, demonstrated that the most up-regulated
(≥  2-fold) anti-apoptotic genes were the direct targets
BCL2 and BCL-XL, but also MCL1 that is not a BCL6
target gene (Figures 2B and S3). This result also indicates
that although both oncogenes are expressed, BCL6 can

still exert a certain level of repression on BCL-XL and
BCL2 [7]. Protein levels of BCL2, BCL-XL and MCL1
are maintained or even increased in RI-BPI surviving cells
(Figure 2C), suggesting these cells rely on this pathway
for survival upon BCL6 inhibition.
We therefore exposed the set of double sensitive
GCB-DLBCL cell lines (SU-DHL6, DoHH2, SC-1

obatoclax and determined the combinatorial effect using
the combination index (CI, where CI < 1 indicates a
synergistic effect). We found that RI-BPI in combination
with ABT-737 or obatoclax yielded synergistic killing

in all the cell lines tested (Figure 2D). The concurrent
inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL2-family proteins
therefore increases the effect of RI-BPI-induced cell death
in GCB-DLBCL cells that are equally dependent on BCL6
and BCL2 for survival.

Targeting BCL6 can overcome intrinsic
resistance to BH3 mimetic inhibitors

oncogene addiction. In this case, RI-BPI might restore
sensitivity to BH3 mimetic drugs. We therefore examined
the effect of sequential combinatorial treatment on a
panel of BCL2 independent DLBCL cells, by calculating
the dose reduction index (DRI). We found that all but
one (i.e. SU-DHL8) of these DLBCL cell lines, including
OCI-Ly7, gained sensitivity to ABT-737 and obatoclax after
RI-BPI treatment (Figure 3C). In agreement with the lack
of acquired sensitivity to BH3 mimetics, RI-BPI treatment
in SU-DHL8 cells did not result in increased levels of antiapoptotic BCL2 and MCL1, and minimally of BCL-XL
(Figure 3D). These data suggest a scenario whereby BCL6
inhibitor induction of anti-apoptotic BCL2/BCL-XL or
MCL1 results in a new equilibrium that allows cell survival.
This balance is then tilted to pro-apoptotic proteins by BH3
mimetic drugs causing enhanced killing of DLBCL cells.

To determine whether BCL6 inhibition also
up-regulates anti-apoptotic BH3 genes in BCL2
independent DLBCL cells, we exposed OCI-Ly1 and
OCI-Ly7 to RI-BPI and analyzed gene expression by qRTPCR. We found that RI-BPI up-regulated BCL2, BCLXL and MCL1 in OCI-Ly1 cells and BCL-XL and MCL1
in OCI-Ly7 cells (Figure 3A). This translates in protein
upregulation in both cell lines (Figure 3B) except for BCL2
in OCI-Ly7 cells that harbors a BCL2 deletion making it
highly resistant to ABT-737 [14] and obatoclax (Figure 2A).
However, we wondered whether this molecular context
could create a newly acquired dependence on pro-survival
BCL2 proteins upon BCL6 inhibition, therefore switching

Proteasome and NAE inhibition potentiate the
therapeutic effect of BCL6 inhibitors

the anti-proliferative effect of bortezomib or MLN4924
in GCB-DLBCL cells is not primarily associated with
significant inhibition of NFκB. We then exposed GCBDLBCL cells SU-DHL6 and OCI-Ly1 to bortezomib and
MLN4924 and measured NOXA levels by immunoblots.
We found a significant stabilization of NOXA in these
conditions (Figure 4C), prompting us to investigate
whether these drugs can also decrease the reliance on
BCL2 after BCL6 inhibition. BMF, another BH3-only
sensitizer that is up-regulated with proteasome treatment
[31], increased upon MLN4924 treatment in SU-DHL6
cells (Fig. S5), but not with bortezomib or in other cell
lines (Fig. S5).
As individual agents, MLN4924 and bortezomib
manifested anti-lymphoma effects in our panel of GCBDLBCL cells (Figure 4D). The most active drug was
bortezomib, with only two cell lines, SC-1 and SUDHL4 identified as resistant (Figure 4D). MLN4924
required higher doses to induce cell death, with 6 cell
lines featuring a GI50 higher than 100 nM (Figure 4D).
Most notably MLN4924 and bortezomib enhanced the
response of GCB-DLBCL cells to RI-BPI, as determined
by favorable DRIs in all the cell lines tested (Figure 4E).
These data suggest that increasing BH3-only sensitizers
can also tilt the balance towards apoptosis upon BCL6
inhibition.

The anti-apoptotic BCL2-family proteins bind to
pro-apoptotic BH3-only activators BID and BIM [15].
In DLBCL and most solid tumors, overcoming BIM
sequestration by BCL-XL/BCL2 and/or MCL1 is a critical
mechanism of BH3 mimetics ABT-737 and obatoclax
[14, 16, 17]. Therefore, increasing free amounts of BIM
or BH3-only sensitizers (e.g. NOXA, BAD, BIK, HRK,
BMF) could be another mechanism to overcome oncogene
switching upon BCL6 inhibition [18]. We analyzed the
effect of RI-BPI on transcript levels of BH3-only members
and (mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization)
M.O.M.P. effectors BAX and BAK in GCB-DLBCL
cells (SU-DHL6, OCI-Ly1, OCI-L7, SC-1 and DoHH2)
as before. We found that M.O.M.P. effectors BAX and
BAK and BH-3 only BIM were consistently upregulated
in all the cell lines tested (Figure 4A). There was an
increase in some BH3-only sensitizers like BIK in SUDHL6 and BMF in SU-DHL6, SC-1 and DoHH2 (Figure
4A), indicating that level of most BH3-only sensitizers
is not under BCL6 regulation. This effectively translates
into BIM protein up-regulation in SU-DHL6, OCI-Ly1
and OCI-Ly7 cell lines (Figure 4B). Overall indicating
that likely most of the BIM increase after RI-BPI is
sequestered by increases in BCL2/BCL-XL and/or MCL1,
since BIM can bind to all the anti-apoptotic members [19].
Like several members of the BCL2 family [20],
previous studies suggested that proteins levels of NOXA,
a BH3-only sensitizer that binds to MCL1 [19], are
stabilized upon proteosome inhibition by bortezomib
[21–23] or NAE inhibition by MLN4924 [21, 24, 25], an
NFkB independent mechanism [26]. Excepting OCI-Ly7
cells that harbor a NOXA mutation, our data shows that
in GCB-DLBCL cells NOXA is not controlled by BCL6
transcriptional activity since its levels are unchanged
upon RI-BPI (Figure 4A). We thus reasoned that posttranslationally increasing levels of NOXA could be a
good strategy to sensitize cells to RI-BPI. Although
the anti-lymphoma effects of proteasome inhibitors
and MLN4924 in GCB-DLBCL cells have shown to be
primarily independent from NFκB inhibition [27–30], we
first determined the effect of these drugs on the NFκB
pathway in GCB-DLBCL cells. We measured NFκB
activation using a DNA-binding assay for p50, p52, p65,
Rel-B and c-Rel in the GCB-DLBCL cell lines OCILy1, OCI-Ly7, SU-DHL6 and the ABC-DLBCL cell line
HBL-1 (as control), baseline and after bortezomib and
MLN4924 treatment. We found a significantly higher
baseline activation of p50 and p52 in HBL-1 vs. the GCBDLBCL cells (p< 0.01, Figure S4). The activation of
these and p65 decreased upon bortezomib and MLN4924
treatment in HBL-1 cells almost completely (Fig. S4), but
in OCI-Ly1 cells only p50 showed a mild decrease upon
bortezomib treatment (Fig. S4). These data indicate that

Combinatorial targeting of BCL6 feedback
mechanisms yields increased anti-lymphoma
efficacy in vivo
Targeting BCL6 and its on-target survival feedback
through activation of BCL2 may serve as a rational
combinatorial therapy for GCB-DLBCL patients. Hence
we next wished to determine the anti-lymphoma effect
of these combinatorial approaches on already established
lymphomas in vivo. For these experiments OCI-Ly1 and
OCI-Ly7 cells were injected in the right flank of SCID
mice (n = 80 for each cell line) and tumor growth was
allowed until reaching a volume of 75 - 100 mm3. Mice
were then randomized in eight groups of ten mice each
and treated intraperitoneally with: vehicle (captisol),
RI-BPI 25 mg/kg/day, ABT-737 50 mg/kg/day (only in
OCI-Ly1), obatoclax 2 mg/kg/day (only in OCI-Ly7),
bortezomib 0.3 mg/kg/day, MLN4924 15 mg/kg every 12
h, RI-BPI + ABT-737 (in OCI-Ly1), RI-BPI + obatoclax
(in OCI-Ly7), RI-BPI + bortezomib and RI-BPI +
MLN4924 (Figure 5A). Doses of individual drugs were
chosen to achieve approximately 50% reduction in tumor
mass while minimizing toxicity accordingly to published
data in similar models [1, 27, 29, 32]. Tumor growth was
measured every day during the 10-day treatment course
and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.
At day 10, tumor growth was significantly reduced by
the administration of RI-BPI, ABT-737 (in OCI-Ly1),
obatoclax (in OCI-Ly7), bortezomib and MLN4924 as

single agents when compared to vehicle treated mice
(p<0.05, T-test, Figures 5B and S6A). RI-BPI as a single
drug was more effective than obatoclax and MLN4924
in OCI-Ly7 xenografts (p<0.05, T-test, Fig. S6A) while
bortezomib was more effective than obatoclax also in
OCI-Ly7 mice (p<0.05, T-test, Figure S6A). All the
drugs were equally effective as single agents in OCI-Ly1
xenografts (Figure 5B).
In combinatorial experiments, RI-BPI + ABT737, RI-BPI + MLN4924 and RI-BPI + bortezomib
significantly reduced OCI-Ly1 tumor growth compared
to the most active drug in the combination (T-test p =
0.021, p = 0.013 and p < 0.01, respectively, Figure 5B).
In OCI-Ly7 xenografts, only the combination of RI-BPI
+ bortezomib was significantly better than RI-BPI alone
(T-test p < 0.03, Fig. S6A). Likely due to lack of BCL2
and NOXA proteins, OCI-Ly7 xenografts are highly
resistant to the dose of obatoclax we have used in this
model, making the combination with RI-BPI not better
than RI-BPI alone (Figure S6A). We therefore tested
the combination of RI-BPI and obatoclax in another
GCB-DLBCL xenograft model with less BCL2-family
dysregulation. We implanted SU-DHL6 cells into SCID
mice and once tumors reached a volume of 75 – 100
mm3 mice were randomized in four groups of five mice
each and treated intraperitoneally with vehicle (captisol),
RI-BPI, obatoclax and their combination as before. In
this model, the combination of RI-BPI + obatoclax was
significantly better than each drug alone (Mann Whitney
test p = 0.031, Figure S6B), suggesting that BH3 mimetic
drug effectors like BCL2 should be present for the effect,
at least when using relatively low drug concentrations.
Although neither combination induced gross
toxicity in mice (failure to thrive, illness or death), the
combination of RI-BPI with bortezomib in OCI-Ly7 and
the combination with ABT-737 in OCI-Ly1 resulted in
reduced body weight gain compared to their respective
controls (Figure S6C). This decrease in body weight
with the combination of RI-BPI and ABT-737 in OCILy1 xenografts together with a preferentially increase in
MCL1 and BCL-XL after RI-BPI in OCI-Ly7 in vitro,
prompted us to change to obatoclax as the BH3 mimetic
drug of choice for OCI-Ly7 and SU-DHL6 xenografts.
We conducted additional toxicity experiments in
C57BL/6 mice treated as before (we used obatoclax as
the BH3 mimetic compound) and found no evidence of
toxicity in these mice by body weight follow-up, plasma
hematology and biochemistry parameters (Table S2),
other than mild monocytosis and AST increase (although
within normal range) in mice receiving bortezomib
(Table S2). Due to this effect and because RI-BPI with
bortezomib is the most active combination in these
models, we examined the bone marrow and liver (Figure
5C), and spleen, kidney, lung, intestine and heart (Figure
S7) of C57BL/6 mice treated with this combination and
found no evidence of pathological toxicity, rendering
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these mild alterations in biochemistry parameters as
likely functional.
Post-treatment OCI-Ly1 lymphoma tissues
were examined for apoptosis using TUNEL
immunohistochemistry staining. As individual drugs, RIBPI, obatoclax and bortezomib significantly increased
the percent of apoptotic nuclei (p = 0.0004, p = 0.002
and p = 0.0008, respectively vs. vehicle control, MannWhitney test, Figure 5D, 5E). In combinatorial analysis,
when compared to the best individual treatment in
the combination, RI-BPI + obatoclax (p = 0.0023
vs. obatoclax, Mann-Whitney test, Figure 5D, 5E), and
RI-BPI + bortezomib (p = 0.0002 vs. RI-BPI, MannWhitney test, Figure 5D, 5E), significantly increased the
percent of apoptotic nuclei. Overall, these data provide
an approach for rational combinatorial therapy of GCBDLBCL through disruption of feedback mechanisms that
would otherwise attenuate response to BCL6-targeted
therapy (Figure 5F).

DISCUSSION
BCL6 is a broadly relevant therapeutic target for
DLBCL since a majority of DLBCLs require and are
hence addicted to BCL6 to maintain their proliferation
and survival. Consequently, BCL6 inhibition suppresses
lymphoma cells by simultaneously de-repressing
multiple genes and delivering a powerful antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic signal to lymphoma cells.
These effects are well established in relation to the action
of BCL6 on genes such as ATR, TP53 (p53), CDKN1A
(p21), EP300 (p300) and GADD45G [6, 8, 33]. Here we
showed that another important pathway reactivated upon
BCL6 inhibition includes the pro-apoptotic M.O.M.P.
effectors BAX and BAK, and the BH3-only activator
BIM.
However, BCL6 inhibition also activates BCL6
target genes such as BCL2 and BCL2L1 (BCL-XL),
and secondary MCL1, which can sustain lymphoma
survival by suppressing the activity of pro-apoptotic
BH3 proteins. It is therefore reasonable to postulate that
de-repression of oncogenes could serve as an “addiction
switching” resistance mechanism in GCB-DLBCL
whereby cells switch from being BCL6 dependent to
being more reliant on BCL2-family proteins (Figure
5F). The data suggest that these proteins may constitute
a feedback network of oncogenes that provide resistance
to the checkpoint activation induced by BCL6 inhibition.
In addition to general checkpoint activation GCBDLBCL cells treated with RI-BPI may also become
more dependent on BCL2 (and BCLXL or MCL1) to
counteract the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only
proteins such as BIM that otherwise would trigger cell
death. This dependence of BCL2 for survival in absence
of functional BCL6 makes them more sensitive to BCL2

directed treatments (Figure 5F). Consequently, we
showed that once BCL6 activity is suppressed, additional
targeting of resistance mechanisms such as BCL2/BCLXL/MCL1 provides superior anti-lymphoma effect.
Therefore, at least in pre-clinical models, oncogene
addiction switching appears as a dynamic process
that could potentially impact the way treatments are
translated to patients. For example, although MCL1
is preferentially de-regulated in a fraction of ABCDLBCLs and its expression is associated with response
to obatoclax[34], our results showed that MCL1 upregulation is a common feature upon BCL6 inhibition
also in GCB-DLBCLs, making them more sensitive
to obatoclax. A similar scenario seems to apply to
MLN4924 and bortezomib. Because their expression is
transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally inducible,
pre-treatment biopsy evaluation of basal expression
levels of these BH3 family proteins may not be always as
informative to select candidates for BH3 mimetic drugs.
Non-genetic adaptive resistance mechanisms to
targeted therapies, such as these, are poorly described in
DLBCL and have not been characterized for transcription
factor targeted therapy, yet are critically important
as exemplified in non-small cell lung cancer for antiEGFR signaling drugs[12] and in B-cell acute lymphoid
leukemia for tyrosine kinase inhibitors[8]. These
mechanisms underline the need to monitor tumor cells for
these effects in the context of clinical trials of targeted
therapeutics through serial biopsies or other companion
biomarkers. DLBCL and other malignancies may acquire
new oncogene dependencies when the primary survival
mechanism is disabled. Here we illustrated an on-target
oncogene switching mechanism from BCL6 to BCL2 as
drivers of the lymphoma phenotype.
Finally, our results showed that, in mice, RI-BPI
could be safely administered concurrently with additional
anti-lymphoma drugs such as BCL2-, NAE- and
proteasome-inhibitor drugs. Our GCB-DLBCL xenograft
models responded differently to RI-BPI combinations,
whereas OCI-Ly1 mice were responsive to ABT-737,
MLN4924 and bortezomib combinations, OCI-Ly7 mice
were only significantly responsive to the bortezomib
combination. However another model of GCB-DLBCL,
SU-DHL6, was responsive to the combination of RIBPI and obatoclax. These results could reflect a broader
BCL2-family dysregulation in OCI-Ly7 (vs. SU-DHL6
and OCI-Ly1) since it carries a BCL2 deletion together
with NOXA mutation, and/or the pleiotropic activity of
bortezomib on other targets. The data presented here
indicates that in GCB-DLBCL BCL6 inhibitors could
serve as crucial building blocks for novel rationally
designed combinatorial therapies geared towards more
effectively eradicating lymphomas with less toxicity than
current chemotherapy-based regimens.

was synthesized by Biosynthesis Inc. ABT-737, obatoclax
and MLN4924 were obtained from Selleck Chemicals,
bortezomib was obtained from Sigma and captisol from
MedChem.

RNA interference assays
DLBCL cells (3 × 106 to 5 × 106) were transfected
with 1 micromolar siRNA for BCL6 (siBCL6-1
HSS100968 Life Technologies, siBCL6-2 SI00311129
Qiagen, siBCL6-3 SI0031143 Qiagen and siBCL6-4
SI0031150 Qiagen) or control (GFP targeting siRNA)
using 96-well electroporation (SF buffer, Lonza).

Immunoblots
Cell pellets containing 5 × 106 cells were washed
with ice-cold phosphate buffer saline and lysed with
RIPA buffer (Tris-HCl 50mM, NaCl, 150 mM, NP-40
1%, Sodium Deoxylcholate 0.25%, SDS 0.1%), and fresh
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) was added. Protein
concentration in lysates was determined by BCA assay
(Pierce) and 15 μg of protein sample were loaded on
polyacrylamide electrophoresis pre-cast gels (BioRad).
PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk
(Blotting buffer, BioRad). Experiments were conducted at
least in independent triplicates. Densitometry analysis was
performed using ImageJ. We used the following primary
antibodies: mouse anti-BCL6 (SC-7388, Santa Cruz),
rabbit anti-BCL2 (SC-7382, Santa Cruz), rabbit antiMCL1 (SC-819, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-BIM (2933S,
Cell Signaling Technologies), rabbit anti-BLC-XL (2764S,

flank with GCB-DLBCL cell lines OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly7
and SU-DHL6. Tumor volumes were monitored every
day using electronic calipers (Fischer Scientific). When
tumor reached a palpable size (around 75 to 100 mm3)
animals were randomized into 8 groups of 10 mice (or
four groups of 5 mice for SU-DHL6 xenografts) and
treated intraperitoneally accordingly to the schedule and
doses shown in Figure 5A. In combinatorial treatments,
mice were injected with RI-BPI (or vehicle) alone the first
day followed by the combination the subsequent days. We
used the area-under-the-curve (AUC) as the quantitative
metric to represent the evolution of tumor volume over
the time frame (10 – 13 days) of the experiment. The
comparisons between treated and control mice were
done using MANOVA followed by pair-wise comparison
using the two-tailed T-test or Mann Whitney test for SUDHL6 mice. Rat pharmacokinetic: Animal procedures
followed NIH protocols and were conducted by Calvert
Laboratories (study 0835RM44.001, Scott Township,
PA). Briefly, male Sprague=Dawley rats (n = 3) were
injected intravenously with 10 mg/kg of RI-BPI in sterile
50% water:50% saline and whole blood samples were
collected through a jugular vein catheter at several timepoints. Derived plasma samples were analyzed by HPLCUV to determine RI-BPI concentration. Pharmacokinetic
parameters were estimated using a non-compartmental
approach consistent with the route of administration.
The AUC that describe the total exposure to RI-BPI was
estimated with the linear trapezoidal method and used to
derive in vitro exposure doses.

Cells were grown on U-bottom 96-well plates at
respective concentrations sufficient to keep untreated cells
under exponential growth by the time of read-out after
treatment. Cells were exposed to each drug alone and to
the combination of both drugs on the same plate in 48 h
experiments. In sequential experiments, compounds were
added 48 h apart in 72 h experiments. Cell viability was
then determined using a fluorometric assay based on the
resazurin reduction activity of the cells (Cell Titer Blue,
Promega) and confirmed by trypan blue dye-exclusion
(Sigma). Fluorescence was determined for controls and
three replicates per treatment condition using the Synergy4
microplate reader (BioTek). Standard curves were
obtained for each individual cell line with the cell count
and fluorescence values. The number of viable cells was
obtained using the least-squares regression method of the
standard curve and by doing a ratiometric quantification
of viable cells normalized to the respective controls.
Experiments were conducted in triplicates. A cell killing
effect was calculated as the 1 — normalized viability
value. Dose necessary for 50% of growth inhibition (GI50),
combinatorial indexes (CI) and Dose Reduction Indexes
(DRI) for a fraction affected (Fa) of 0.5, were determined
using the CompuSyn software (Biosoft).

NFkB activity assay
The DNA-binding capacity of NFkB (p50, p52,
c-Rel, Rel-B and p65) was assayed by a plate-based
assay (TransAM, Active Motif, Carlsbad) following
the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 5x106 GCBDLBCL cells were treated with vehicle, bortezomib
or MLN4924 and 10 μg of nuclear lysates were added
to the wells containing pre-adsorbed NFkB consensus
or competitor (mutant) oligonucleotides. HBL-1 cells
(ABC-DLBCL) were used as positive controls for the
assay. After incubation and washing, primary anti-NFkB
antibody was added to each well, followed by HPRanti-rabbit secondary antibody. After HRP substrate
addition, absorbance was read at 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 655 nm (Synergy4, Biotek). In this assay
the absorbance is directly proportional to the quantity of
DNA-bound transcription factor present in the sample.
Experiments were carried out in four replicates. Results
were expressed as mean absorbance values with SEM to
mutant probe. P-values were obtained by two-tailed T-test.

TUNEL assay
DNA fragmentation coupled to the apoptotic
response was detected in morphologically identifiable
nuclei and apoptotic bodies present in formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tumors by the TUNEL assay
(ApopTag, Chemicon, Temecula, California) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue slides were pre-treated
with 0.5% trypsin for 15 minutes (Zymed, San Francisco,
California), to improve the exposure of DNA.
