Abstract
Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibition has elicited
encouraging responses in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. Unfortunately, unless combined with a bone marrow
transplant, disease relapse is frequent. In addition to the
acquired point mutations in the FLT3 kinase domain that
contribute to FLT3 inhibitor resistance, MEK/ERK signaling is
persistently activated in AML cells even when FLT3 phosphorylation is continually suppressed. Thus, concomitant targeting
of FLT3 and MAPK may potentially exert synergistic activity to
counteract the resistance of AML cells to FLT3-targeted therapy.
In this study, we investigated the antileukemia activity of a MEK1
and FLT3 dual inhibitor, E6201, in AML cells resistant to FLT3

Introduction
Mutations of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and N/KRAS
genes are common in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) with normal cytogenetics and are present in 24% to
30% (1, 2) and 10% to 15% (3), respectively. FLT3 internal
tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD) are the most common
mutations, with the kinase domain (D835) mutation occurring
less frequently. Similarly, NRAS mutation is more frequent than
KRAS mutation in AML. These mutations in turn lead to aberrant
activation of FLT3 and/or RAS–MAPK pathways. Responses
to single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of FLT3 (e.g.,

inhibition. We found that E6201 exerted profound apoptogenic
effects on AML cells harboring resistance-conferring FLT3 mutations. This activity appeared to be p53 dependent, and E6201induced cytotoxicity was retained under hypoxic culture conditions and during coculture with mesenchymal stem cells that
mimic the AML microenvironment. Furthermore, E6201
markedly reduced leukemia burden and improved the survival
of mice in a human FLT3–mutated AML model. Collectively, our
data provide a preclinical basis for the clinical evaluation
of E6201 in AML patients harboring FLT3 mutations, including
those who relapse following FLT3-targeted monotherapy.

quizartinib and sorafenib; refs. 4, 5) or MAPK (MEK1/2; e.g.,
GSK1120212; ref. 6) have been mostly restricted to patients with
the corresponding mutations, which conﬁrm that these mutations
are valid targets. However, the treatment responses obtained with
these agents have been unsustainable. Acquisition of point mutations, for which novel inhibitors are in early development, has
emerged as an important mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. However, this mechanism does not account for all of the
acquired resistance processes that have been reported (7). Indeed,
the aberrant activation of parallel signaling pathways such as
MAPK and AKT may also contribute to acquired resistance (8).
In our clinical trials with sorafenib, the upregulation of phospho-ERK was observed in AML cells from patients with disease
relapse, suggesting that MAPK activation takes place even when
FLT3 phosphorylation remained suppressed (5). In addition, we
have developed sorafenib-resistant cells by introducing clinically
relevant point mutations of FLT3 into murine leukemia cells (e.g.,
Ba/F3-ITDþ842 and Ba/F3-ITDþ676/842), and the upregulation
of phospho-ERK was also observed in these cells (9). Unfortunately, similar data are not available for patients treated with MEK
inhibitors. However, preclinical data suggest that FLT3 is upregulated when AML cells are exposed to an inhibitor of MEK
signaling (10). Furthermore, concomitantly targeting FLT3 and
MEK signaling pathways has achieved encouraging synergistic
antileukemia effects in our in vitro and ex vivo studies, suggesting a
potential for preventing/overcoming relapse in patients treated
with FLT3 inhibitors like sorafenib and quizartinib (9).
E6201 is a synthetic small molecule that functions as a nonallosteric TKI, which inhibits both MEK1 and FLT3 (11). E6201
shows identical afﬁnity and residence time for the active and

Targeting MEK/FLT3 via E6201 Overcomes TKI Resistance in AML

inactive forms of MEK1 (12) and demonstrates different pharmacologic activities than those of allosteric MEK inhibitors and
exerts exclusive effects on targeting acquired MEK1-C121S mutation, which confers resistance to the allosteric MEK inhibitor
selumetinib (AZD6244) in melanoma (13). E6201 also has a
long occupancy time for FLT3 (11-fold longer than that for MEK).
In addition, the backbone structure of E6201 markedly differs
from other allosteric FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib or quizartinib (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, E6201 is an attractive
clinical compound for effectively targeting leukemic cells with
aberrant activation of both FLT3 and MAPK signaling pathways,
especially for those resistant to FLT3 inhibitors.
Here, we report that E6201 has marked cytotoxic activity
against AML cells harboring FLT3-ITD or NRAS mutations.
E6201 was especially effective in the killing of FLT3 inhibitor–
resistant cells harboring acquired point mutations of the FLT3
tyrosine kinase domains (TKD). Thus, one third of AML patients
harboring FLT3 mutations may beneﬁt from a dual MAPK/FLT3
inhibitor with potent anticancer effects, including in cells resistant
to FLT3 monotherapy.

AML cell lines and patient samples
The Ba/F3-FLT3, Ba/F3-ITD, Ba/F3-D835G, and Ba/F3D835Y cell lines (kindly provided by Dr. Donald Small in

2010, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) were derived from immortalized
murine pro-B lymphocyte Ba/F3 cells that were transfected
with lentivirus containing human FLT3 or FLT3-ITD mutations,
isolated, and characterized in 2002 as described previously
(14). The FLT3 inhibitor–resistant cells Ba/F3-ITDþ691, Ba/
F3-ITDþ842, and Ba/F3-ITDþ676/842 cells, which harbored
FLT-ITD plus F691L, Y842C, and N676D/Y842C mutations,
respectively, were established in 2013 as described previously
(9). The human AML cell lines THP-1, Kasumi-1, and MV4-11
were obtained from the ATCC, OCI/AML3 cell line from Dr. M.
Minden (Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada), and MOLM13 cell line from the Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen. MV4-11-NRAS–
mutated and parental cells were established in 2013 by lentivirally transfecting NRAS/G12D mutations as described previously (15). All cell lines were validated by short tandem repeat
(STR) DNA ﬁngerprinting using the AmpFISTR Identiﬁler Kit
according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems;
cat 4322288) in September 2010. The STR proﬁles were compared with known ATCC ﬁngerprints (ATCC.org) and with
the Cell Line Integrated Molecular Authentication database version 0.1.200808 (http://bioinformatics.hsanmartino.it/clima/;
nucleic acids research 37:D925-D932 PMCID: PMC2686526).
The STR proﬁles matched known DNA ﬁngerprints or were
unique. All cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% FBS, and IL3-dependent murine Ba/F3-FLT3 cells were
maintained in the presence of 2 ng/mL of IL3. The genetic
characteristics of AML cell lines used in this study are summarized
in Table 1.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), obtained from normal bone
marrows following institutional guidelines, were cultured at a
density of 5,000 cells/cm2 in a-MEM, supplemented with 20%
FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. The MSCs
were used for coculture experiments after passage four.
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients with
newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory AML after written
informed consent had been obtained from each patient (according to the institutional guidelines of the University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The patient characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table S1. The mononuclear
cells in these samples were puriﬁed by Ficoll-Hypaque (SigmaAldrich) density gradient centrifugation, and the cells were

cultured in RPMI1640 culture medium, supplemented with 10%
FCS as described above prior to treatment.
Cell viability and apoptosis assays
Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue dye exclusion
method, and apoptosis was determined via FACS by Annexin V
positivity as described previously (16). The 50% IC50 for cell
growth inhibition and the 50% EC50 for apoptosis induction were
calculated using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). Apoptosis induction of leukemic progenitor cells (i.e., the CD34þ AML cells) was
determined as described above by calculating speciﬁc apoptosis
using the following formula: speciﬁc apoptosis (%) ¼ 100 (druginduced apoptosisspontaneous apoptosis)/(100spontaneous
apoptosis; ref. 17).
For measuring apoptosis induction in the leukemia cells cocultured with MSC, the cells were trypsinized and stained with CD90PE and Annexin V-Cy5 (both from BD Biosciences), and apoptosis
was assessed by measuring Annexin V-Cy5 positivity after excluding the CD90þ (used as a MSC marker)cell population.
Immunoblot analyses
AML cells were treated with E6201 or sorafenib at the indicated
concentrations and then collected for analysis. Semiquantitative
assessment of immunoblots was determined using the Scion
Imaging system and software (Beta version 4.03; Scion; ref. 18).
Animal study
The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NOG) mice (10-week-old female; n ¼ 27; The
Jackson Laboratory) were injected intravenously with 0.5  106 of
MOLM13-Luci-GFP cells that were lentivirally infected with ﬁreﬂy
luciferase. Mice were treated with either E6201 (40 mg/kg, n ¼ 14)
or saline (n ¼ 13) via tail vein at a twice-weekly schedule, which
started from day 4 to day 21 after leukemia cell injection. Mice
were noninvasively imaged in a Xenogen-200 in vivo bioluminescence imaging system (Xenogen) after injection with a D-luciferin
(4 mg/mouse) substrate. Bioluminescence imaging based on the
detection of light emission was measured in photons/second and
has been described in detail elsewhere (19). Three mice for each
group were sacriﬁced on day 16 after tumor cell injection, and
spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow samples were collected for
immunohistochemical analysis. Brieﬂy, the collected tissues were
ﬁxed for 30 minutes in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution.
The tissues for immunoﬂuorescence were dehydrated in serial
concentrations of sucrose in DPBS and frozen in 100% optimal
cutting temperature medium. Sections were labeled with

anti–phospho-ERK antibody (cat # 9101, Cell Signaling Technology). The tissues were ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
solution at 4 C overnight, then dehydrated, embedded in parafﬁn, and sectioned. After antigen retrieval, the slides were incubated with anti-luciferase or anti-Ki67 antibodies.
Statistical analyses
The Student t test was used to analyze immunoblot, cell growth,
and apoptosis data. A P value  0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant. All statistical tests were two-sided and, the results
are expressed as the mean of triplicate samples/experiments 
SD/95% conﬁdence intervals (error bars). The efﬁcacy of E6201
on survival was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method (20), and
log rank statistics was used to test for differences in survival.

Results
E6201 exerts marked antileukemia effects in AML cells
We investigated antileukemia effects of E6201 on various
AML cell lines, including those with different mutational status
of FLT3 and RAS. E6201 profoundly inhibited the growth, and
triggered apoptosis, in the FLT3-ITD–mutant leukemic cells
MOLM13 and MV4-11 (IC50, 0.005 and 0.002 mmol/L, respectively) but showed close to 100-fold less activity against FLT3
wild-type (WT) cells THP-1 and Kasumi-1 (IC50, 0.67 and 0.37
mmol/L, respectively; Fig. 1A; Table 1). We further tested E6201
in murine leukemia cells harboring FLT3-ITD and/or TKD
mutations. Ba/F3-ITD cells were 1,000-fold more sensitive than
the parental cells Ba/F3-FLT3 (IC50, 0.003 vs. 3.18 mmol/L). To
exclude potential interference of IL3 in inhibition of Ba/F3FLT3 cells, which are IL3-dependent, by E6201, these cells were
also treated with E6201 in the absence of IL3. Ba/F3-FLT3 cells
were still approximately 140-fold less sensitive than Ba/F3-ITD
cells (IC50-, 0.42 vs. 0.003 mmol/L; Fig. 1A; Table 1). Importantly, E6201 inhibited proliferation of FLT3 TKD-mutated
cells Ba/F3-D835G and Ba/F3-D835Y (IC50, 0.0046 and
0.026 mmol/L, respectively; Fig. 1A; Table 1). These TKD mutations usually show more resistance to FLT3-targeting therapy in
clinic. Speciﬁcally, compared with the clinically potent FLT3
inhibitor quizartinib (21), E6201 demonstrated more potent
antiproliferative effects in leukemic cells harboring these TKD
mutations (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, E6201 also
demonstrated strong antiproliferative effects in FLT3 inhibitor–
resistant cells, which carry acquired point mutations in the
kinase domains in addition to FLT3-ITD mutations, such as Ba/
F3-ITDþ691, Ba/F3-ITDþ842, and Ba/F3-ITDþ676/842 (IC50;
0.1, 0.0089, and 0.0056 mmol/L, respectively), and induced
profound apoptosis in these cells as well (Table 1; Fig. 1A). We
compared the sensitivities of these resistant cells and their
parental Ba/F3-ITD cells to E6201 and sorafenib. E6201 exerted
marked proapoptotic effects relative to that induced by sorafenib (i.e., 124- to 327-fold higher activity; Table 2) in the
resistant cell lines. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that

E6201 signiﬁcantly suppressed phospho-FLT3, phospho-ERK,
and phospho-STAT5, which was accompanied by the downregulation of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and the activation of caspase-3 (Fig.
1B and C). To further evaluate if E6201 had better effectiveness
in targeting MAPK than other FLT3 inhibitors, which might be
more dependent on their suppression of FLT3 signaling pathway and then its cascade downstream MAPK, ITD-mutated cells
Ba/F3-ITD and FLT3 inhibitor–resistant cells Ba/F3-ITDþ691
and Ba/F3-ITDþ676/842 were treated at their IC50 concentrations to individual cell lines. Immunoblot analysis showed that
E6201 had more effective inhibition of phospho-ERK than
sorafenib or quizartinib (AC220) in the resistant cell lines,
although it showed the same suppression level of phosphoFLT3 to each drug at their IC50 concentrations (Fig. 1D). The
results imply that E6201 has direct suppressing effect of phospho-ERK in addition to targeting FLT3 signaling pathway,
which is more effective in FLT3 inhibitor–resistant cells and
may beneﬁt in overcoming the resistance in these cells.
Activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway by NRAS mutation
sensitizes E6201-induced proapoptotic effects in AML cells
Because E6201 demonstrated more effectiveness of MAPK
inhibition compared with other FLT3 inhibitors, we next investigated its effects against AML cells that harbor RAS mutations.
Interestingly, the NRAS-mutant OCI/AML3 cells, which usually
show resistance to many other FLT3 inhibitors in our hands
(22), also demonstrated higher sensitivity to E6201 (IC50,
0.037 mmol/L; Table 1), suggesting that high ERK activation might
be responsible for sensitivity to E6201 treatment (15). Furthermore, E6201 triggered higher apoptosis induction in MV4-11NRAS–mutated cells than in their parental controls (Fig. 2A). The
MV4-11-NRAS–mutated cells have higher basal level of phosphoERK and lower basal levels of phospho-FLT3 and -STAT5 relative
to the NRAS WT cells. A 6-hour E6201 treatment resulted in more
suppression of phospho-ERK, but not phospho-FLT3 or phosphoSTAT5 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a 24-hour treatment triggered
profound upregulation of proapoptotic protein Bim and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 2C), suggesting an enhanced proapoptotic
effect in NRAS-mutant AML cells, also implying that the inhibition of MAPK signaling might be indispensable in these cells.
E6201 exerts proapoptotic effects in AML patient samples with
FLT3-ITD mutations
We next tested cytotoxicity of E6201 in eight AML blast samples
with different FLT3 and NRAS mutational proﬁles. The results
shown in Fig. 3A illustrated that E6201 exerted marked cytotoxic
effects in all of the ﬁve patient samples tested with FLT3-ITD
mutations, including one patient sample with dual FLT3-ITD
and NRAS mutations. Three of these samples were obtained
from patients with relapsed/refractory disease (Supplementary
Table S1). E6201 induced modest apoptosis in AML patient
samples with FLT3 D835 mutation and had only a minor apoptotic effect on WT FLT3 cells (Fig. 3A). Of note, E6201 also did

E6201 abrogates protection mediated by FL, bone marrow
stromal cells, and hypoxia in FLT3-mutated AML cells
FL induction has been reported as a cellular response of AML
cells to chemotherapy, and it is associated with resistance to FLT3targeted therapy (23). We tested the effects of E6201 on the FLT3ITD–mutated/FLT3 inhibitor–resistant cells. We observed that
exogenous FL (25 ng/mL) reduced the sorafenib-induced

apoptotic effects, especially in the FLT3 inhibitor–resistant Ba/F3ITDþ676/842 cells (P < 0.05). However, E6201 abrogated the
protective effects of exogenous FL and demonstrated similar
pattern of apoptosis induction as those without FL treatment
(Fig. 4A). Of note, the Ba/F3-ITDþ676/842 cells demonstrated a
higher basal level of phospho-ERK in the presence of FL, suggesting that E6201 sensitivity may be due to the MEK-inhibitory
activity rather than FLT3 inhibition. Immunoblot analysis
showed that E6201 was more effective in suppressing phospho-ERK and downregulating antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 in
the presence of FL compared with sorafenib treatment alone in
Ba/F3-ITDþ676/842 cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that
E6201 can effectively abrogate the putative protective effects of
FL, as a potential resistance mechanism, in AML cells with FLT3
mutations.
Components of the bone marrow microenvironment,
including MSCs and hypoxia, can also provide protection for
leukemia cells during chemotherapy (24). Therefore, we investigated the impact of coculturing the AML cells with MSCs
under hypoxic condition on E6201-triggered apoptosis induction. Ba/F3-ITDþ676/842 cells were exposed to E6201 in
hypoxic or normoxic environments with or without MSCs for
24 hours, and phospho-FLT3, phospho-ERK, Bim, and cleaved
caspase-3 levels were measured by immunoblotting. Results
showed that hypoxia increased phospho-FLT3 levels (1.7-fold),
and coculture with MSCs under these conditions further
enhanced the phospho-ERK levels by 2.5-fold (Fig. 4C).
E6201 treatment profoundly suppressed phosphorylation
levels of FLT3 and ERK in hypoxia and the presence of MSCs
(2.2-fold and 2.3-fold in phospho-FLT3 and phospho-ERK
levels, respectively) and markedly increased levels of proapoptotic Bim and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, E6201,
in a dose-dependent manner, signiﬁcantly increased the proapoptotic effects of hypoxia compared with normoxia in the
presence of MSCs (P < 0.01; Fig. 4D). These data suggest that
E6201 can overcome the protection of the bone marrow microenvironment during leukemia therapy.
E6201 suppresses AML in vivo
We further assessed the in vivo efﬁcacy of E6201 in a murine
leukemia model. NOG mice bearing xenografts of MOLM13Luc-GFP cells were examined. E6201 treatment (40 mg/kg
following a twice-weekly schedule via tail-vein injection)
for 3 weeks signiﬁcantly reduced leukemia burden compared
with the vehicle group (i.e., the mean luminescence at day 14:
2.7  106 photons/second vs. 5.6  106 photons/second in the
E6201-treated group vs. vehicle-treated group; Fig. 5A and B).
The median survival was 25 days for the E6201-treated group
versus 18 days in the vehicle-treated group (P < 0.0001; Fig.
5C). In addition, no signs of weight loss or related toxicities
were observed in the treatment cohort (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated

that E6201 treatment reduced leukemia cell inﬁltration and
proliferation in organs including bone marrow, lung, liver, and
spleen (Fig. 5D, top and middle). Meanwhile, E6201 treatment
demonstrated a profound suppression of phosphorylated ERK
in the engrafted leukemic cells found in lung and liver analyzed
by immunoﬂuorescence staining with anti–phospho-ERK antibody (Fig. 5D, bottom).

Discussion
Several mechanisms have been implicated in the acquired
resistance to FLT3-targeted therapy. One of them involves
acquired point mutations in the TKDs, which has been reported
by our group and others (9, 25, 26). In addition, we previously
reported that high levels of phosphorylated ERK persisted in
leukemia blasts after therapy with sorafenib despite continued
suppression of phospho-FLT3 (5), suggesting that high MAPK
activation might constitute another mechanism of resistance.
High ERK activation was also observed in the FLT3 inhibitor–
resistant cell lines (9), and this was further increased by
coculture of these cells with MSCs in hypoxic conditions
(2.5-fold higher; Fig. 4C). E6201 exerted profound proapoptotic effects not only in the FLT3-ITD–mutant cells, but also in
the FLT3 inhibitor–resistant cells, including the Ba/F3ITDþ691 cells (Fig. 1A; Table 2). The latter cells harbor a "gate
keeper" mutation (F691L) in the TKD that is responsible for
sorafenib and quizartinib resistance (27). Importantly, E6201
more effectively suppressed ERK phosphorylation compared
with the other FLT3 inhibitors sorafenib and quizartinib in
FLT3 inhibitor–resistant Ba/F3-ITDþ691 and Ba/F3-ITDþ676/
842 cells, suggesting a direct suppressive effectiveness on MAPK
signaling in addition to FLT3 signaling (Fig. 1A and D and
Supplementary Fig. S4). In fact, concomitantly targeting FLT3
and MEK with FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib and MEK inhibitor CI1040 exerted synergistic proapoptotic effects in the FLT3 inhibitor–resistant AML cells (9). Thus, using the dual FLT3/MEK
inhibitor E6201 may provide an optimal effect on apoptotic
synergism and reduce potential side effects caused by using
multiple drug combinations.
E6201 was also active against NRAS-mutant cells. In our
system, the introduction of mutant NRAS raised the basal
level of phospho-ERK, which might be the dominant survival
signaling pathway in these cells. Speciﬁcally, reduction of
the basal phospho-FLT3 level was observed in MV4-11NRAS–mutated cells compared with their parental WT cells
(Fig. 2B). Therefore, the direct effectiveness of targeting MAPK

Targeting MEK/FLT3 via E6201 Overcomes TKI Resistance in AML

with E6201 may contribute to the sensitivity of AML cells with
mutant NRAS. However, we noticed that THP-1 and Kasumi-1
cells, which harbor NRAS or KRAS mutations, demonstrated
less sensitivity to E6201 compared with OCI/AML3 cells that
harbor NRAS mutations. THP-1 and Kasumi-1 also have
mutant TP53, but OCI/AML3 harbors WT TP53 (http://p53.
free.fr/Database/Cancer_cell_lines/cell_lines_1.0.pdf). To clarify the impact of p53 status on E6201 sensitivity, we compared
parental AML cell lines with their p53 knockdowns and demonstrated that WT p53 protein was critical for sensitizing these
cells to E6201-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S5).
The interactions between the tumor suppressor p53 and
MAPK signaling are still unclear. Several studies have postulated that the activation of MAPK signaling can trigger
increased p53 mRNA levels via activation of its upstream
functional protein C/EBP-b (28–30) or directly through phosphorylation of p53 at Thr55 (31). Our NRAS-mutant cells also
showed increased p53 levels compared with NRAS WT cells
(Fig. 2B). MAPK signaling is also involved in the nuclear
localization and transportation of p53 (32). Conversely, p53
as an upstream protein also enables the upregulation of MAPK
signaling (33). MAPK signaling is also involved in the nuclear
localization and transportation of p53 (34). Our data strongly
support the notion that the aberrant activation of phosphoERK in the NRAS-mutated cells is accompanied by higher levels
of p53 protein (Fig. 2B) and that high p53 levels maintain a
potentially higher basal level of phospho-ERK in TP53 WT cells
(Fig. 2B).
The tumor suppressor p53 mediates cell apoptosis as a
nuclear transcription factor (35) or by transcription-independent mechanisms, such as physical interaction between p53
and Bcl-2 family proteins (36, 37). p53 has a high binding
afﬁnity to antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and a weak binding afﬁnity to
Bcl-xL via different p53 transcription activation domains (38).
p53 reportedly binds Mcl-1 to liberate proapoptotic Bim or Bak
to trigger mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (39). In addition,
the activation of MAPK signaling has been reported to promote
expression of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and to stabilize the protein
(40, 41), which has a very short half-life (42). Thus, the
downregulation of p53 protein, or phosphorylation level of
p53Thr55, via the suppression of MEK signaling with E6201
may limit the binding capacity of Mcl-1 and lead to quick
degradation of Mcl-1 as shown in NRAS-mutated TP53 WT cells
(Fig. 2B and C). Therefore, the exclusivity of E6201 in targeting
MAPK provides a mechanistic rationale for apoptosis induction
via suppression of phospho-ERK, the downregulation of Mcl-1,
and the upregulation of Bim as shown in Fig. 2B and C. Given
the high frequency of NRAS mutations (10% to 30%) and of
WT TP53 (90%) in myeloid malignancies, this would suggest
that E6201 could be highly active in this large subset of myeloid
malignancies.
FL is another upstream activator of the FLT3–MAPK signaling
axis (23). The presence of exogenous FL increases basal levels of
ERK phosphorylation as shown in Ba/F3-ITDþ676/842 cells (Fig.
4B). Concomitantly targeting FLT3 and MEK with the FLT3
inhibitor crenolanib and the MEK inhibitor CI1040 triggered
marked apoptosis in the FLT3 inhibitor–resistant cells (9). Validation of the concept of combined targeting of FLT3 and MEK is
further substantiated by this study of E6201. Mechanistically,
targeting MEK/FLT3 induces leukemia cell death by modulating
the MEK–Mcl-1–Bim signaling axis.

www.aacrjournals.org

FL-mediated proliferation, differentiation, and survival of
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are dependent on cooperation with other growth factors, such as IL3 etc. (43, 44).
Importantly, E6201 demonstrated no effect on IL3-dependent
pro-B Ba/F3-FLT3 cells in the presence of FL, which reﬂects the
physiologic situation of the bone marrow (data not shown).
Taken together, E6201 can overcome FL-mediated resistance in
FLT3-mutant AML but shows limited effect on FLT3 WT cells,
suggesting that its toxicity against normal hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells is likely to be minimal.
The bone marrow microenvironment plays a critical role in
the chemoresistance of AML (45). It has been shown that
hypoxia strikingly increases phosphorylated FLT3 level and the
presence of MSCs and exclusively upregulates ERK activation
and further upregulates Mcl-1 (46, 47), implying upregulation
of MEK/ERK and FLT3 signaling pathways are key factors in the
microenvironment-induced AML cell resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, concomitantly targeting MEK and FLT3 with
E6201 provides the possibility of signiﬁcantly enhancing the
efﬁcacy of FLT3-targeted therapy by overcoming bone marrow–
mediated activation of MAPK, which may provide new therapeutic approach for treating relapsed and refractory AML
patients. A phase I/IIa clinical trial for evaluating antileukemia
efﬁcacy of E6201 on targeting relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated
AML is ongoing currently in MD Anderson Cancer Center
(Houston, TX).
