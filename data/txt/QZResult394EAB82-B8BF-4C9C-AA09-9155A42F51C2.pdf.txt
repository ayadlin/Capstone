ABSTRACT
GV1001 is a telomerase-based cancer vaccine made of a 16-mer telomerase
reverse transcriptase (TERT) peptide, and human TERT, the rate-limiting subunit of
the telomerase complex, is an attractive target for cancer vaccination. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the effect of telomerase peptide vaccination, GV1001 combined
with gemcitabine in treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Human
PDAC cell lines were used in vitro experiment and also, PDAC xenograft mice model
was established using PANC1, AsPC1 and CD133+ AsPC1 (PDAC stem cell). Treatment
groups were divided as follows; control, gemcitabine, GV1001, gemcitabine and
GV1001 combination. The inflammatory cytokines were measured from the blood, and
xenograft tumor specimens were evaluated. GV1001 treatment alone did not affect
the proliferation or the apoptosis of PDAC cells. Gemcitabine alone and gemcitabine
with GV1001 groups had significantly reduced in tumor size and showed abundant
apoptosis compared to other treatment groups. Surprisingly, xenograft PDAC tumor
specimens of gemcitabine alone group had been replaced by severe fibrosis whereas
gemcitabine with GV1001 group had significantly less fibrosis. Blood levels of tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β increased in gemcitabine alone
group, however, it was decreased in gemcitabine with GV1001 group. GV1001
combined with gemcitabine treatment showed significant loss of fibrosis in tumor
tissue as well as tumor cell death. Therefore, further investigation of GV1001 effect
combined with gemcitabine treatment may give us useful insights to overcome the
hurdle in anti-cancer drug delivery over massive fibrosis around PDACs.

have failed and resulted in no significant improvement
[5]. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative
treatment and only 15% of patients could be candidate
for resection [6, 7]. Some chemotherapeutic agents have
been used in treatment of PDACs, and gemcitabine
became the standard chemotherapeutic agent in pancreatic
cancer after randomized trial in 1997 [8]. Gemcitabine
is a nucleoside pyrimidine analogue which exerts its

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a very
aggressive human cancer and has dismal prognosis with
only 6% of patients survive 5 years after diagnosis [14]. In spite of the progresses of treatments, the attempts
at improving survival of patients with PDAC in the past
15 years, especially in the advanced disease setting,

cytotoxic actions primarily by the incorporation of
gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA, leading to masked
chain termination [9]. However, pancreatic cancer is
highly resistant to chemotherapy including gemcitabine,
and the most disappointing circumstance is mainly due to
the late diagnosis of PDAC [10, 11]. In addition, the best
supportive care and maintain the better quality of life are
critical since the majority of the patients with PDACs are
in advanced stage.
Some unique characteristics of PDACs such as
high stromal-to-epithelial ratio (desmoplasia), restricted
vasculature and hypoxic environment, may disturb the
drug delivery for chemotherapy to the tumor thereby
explaining the limited benefits observed to-date [12,
13]. The high proportion of stromal cells in PDAC is
associated with overexpression of several growth factors
and cytokines, which causes resistance to anti-cancer drug
and is also related to poor chemotherapy response rate or
patient prognosis. Drug delivery to pancreatic tumors is
especially difficult because it has hypovascular and poorly
perfused nature. The presence of stomal components
increases the interstitial fluid pressure and prevents drugs
from penetrating the tissue interstitium [12, 14]. To date,
many efforts to find an appropriate combination of multitherapeutic agents with different modes of action to
overcome the chemoresistance have been made during
the past years. The most of these chemotherapeutic agents
have not been successful enough to show the significant
survival benefit [15-21]. Thus, more effective treatment
strategies are highly required, and immunotherapy for
target which is critical in cancer growth seemed to be a
promising approach [22, 23].
In the process of repeated rounds of DNA replication,
the telomeric ends of DNA become progressively
shortened and without a compensatory mechanism cells
senesce and die [24, 25]. Therefore, telomerase expression
is essential for the proliferation of most cancer cells, but
the enzyme is inactive in the majority of normal human
tissues. Reactivation of telomerase, the telomere-repair
enzyme, is a crucial event in oncogenic transformation,
and is highly expressed in essentially all cancer forms,
while the expression in normal tissues is restricted [26].
Moreover, telomerase activity is considered indispensable
for tumor immortalization and growth and occurs in nearly
all pancreatic cancers [26]. That means that inhibiting the
chromosome-elongating enzyme should, in theory, be a
relatively safe and effective way to, if not directly kill,
at least weaken cancer cells before treating with other
agents. Therefore, human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT), the rate-limiting subunit of the telomerase
complex, is an attractive target for cancer vaccination.
GV1001 is a human telomerase reverse transcriptase
catalytic subunit (hTERT) class II 16 mer peptide
vaccine [24, 25]. Bernhardt et al reported in their phase
2 trials that GV1001 treatment in advanced pancreatic
cancer showed a total immune response in 24 (63%) of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

38 patients and those responders had a greater median
survival (216 days) than did non-responders (88 days)
[27]. Although, cytotoxic drugs are generally regarded
as immunosuppressive, some chemotherapy regimens
might potentiate the effect of cancer vaccines [28-33].
The preclinical data clearly showed immunogenicity
of GV1001 in patients with PDACs that the synergy
of gemcitabine with cancer vaccines and the other
positive immunomodulatory effects of gemcitabine
and fluoropyrimidines [26]. Therefore, the aims of this
study were to investigate the effect of telomerase peptide
vaccination, GV1001 combined with gemcitabine in
treatment of PDAC.

RESULTS
Direct cytotoxic effect of GV1001 in PDAC cells
Direct cytotoxic effect of GV1001 was evaluated in
PDAC cells. Flow cytometry analysis was done treated
with GV 1001 for 24 hrs. In Figure 1A and 1B, PDAC
cell lines, PANC1 and AsPC1, were tested according to
the different concentration of GV1001. There were 3
groups according to the different concentration of GV1001
treatment (control, 20 μM and 40 μM). Figure 1A showed
6.23%, 6.03% and 6.4% of Annexin V-positive apoptotic
cells in each group, and Figure 1B showed 7.16%, 5.65%
and 9.73%: control, GV1001 20 μM and GV1001 40
μM accordingly. In addition, the number of cells in early
stages of apoptosis and the late stage of apoptosis didn’t
make any significant statistical differences compared to
the control group and also according to the concentration
of GV1001. In addition, PDAC cells were treated with
GV1001 in various concentrations for 24 hrs, and viability
and proliferation were accessed by CCK-8 assay (Figure
1C and 1D). AsPC1 and PANC1 cells were not affected
their viabilities via GV100 treatment. Therefore, we could
observe that GV1001 did not have direct cytotoxic effect
to PDAC cells.

Changes in body weight and tumor volume upon
GV1001 and gemcitabine treatments in PDAC
xenograft mice
Figure 2A showed an experimental scheme for
PDAC xenograft model and drug treatments. There were
4 different treatment groups: control, GV1001 alone,
gemcitabine alone and GV1001+gemcitabine. After the
completion of protocol (10 days of tumor growth time
+ 14 days of treatment period), each group of mouse
was sacrificed and the gross tumor growth as well as
any signs of PDAC cell dissemination were examined.
PDAC xenograft tumor was successfully established
and all of the study mice had a pair of ovoid PDAC
tumors on both sides of buttocks. In addition, there was
no treatment related mortalities. In the xenograft mouse

model of AsPC1 and PANC1, the body weight of mice
was checked twice a week and the changes of their weight
were represented in Figure 2B and 2C. The body weight
of mice in control and GV1001 alone treatment groups
didn’t change much during the study. However, mice in
gemcitabine alone and GV1001+gemcitabine treatment
groups had sudden decrement of body weight along with
the chemotherapeutic agents. Interestingly, body weight
of GV1001 combination with gemcitabine group was
not dramatically significant compared to gemcitabine
alone treatment group. PDAC xenograft tumors had

different tumor size at the end of treatment, and there
were clearly demarcated tumors in control and GV1001
alone treatment groups. On the other hands, tumors in
GV1001+gemcitabine and gemcitabine alone groups
were nearly disappeared or significantly shrunk in the
gross examination of study mice. The length and width
of each tumor were measured, and volume was calculated
using above mentioned formula: tumor volume = (length
x width2) x π/6 [34]. PDAC xenograft tumors of AsPC1
and PANC1 in the same treatment groups did not show
significant difference in terms of tumor volume. However,

gemcitabine alone and gemcitabine+GV1001 treatment
groups from PDAC xenograft tumors of both AsPC1 and
PANC1 (Figure 2D-2F). In terms of GV1001 effects on
PDAC xenograft tumors, GV1001 single treatment did
not show anti-cancer effect compared to the control group.

amount of reduced tumor tissue and it was confirmed in
pathologic specimens as well. Although both treatment
groups which containing gemcitabine did not show
significant difference in tumor size, there was marked
difference in terms of fibrosis in pathologic specimens
between the two groups. Gemcitabine alone treatment
group showed the abundant fibrosis replaced the tumor
tissue whereas gemcitabine+GV1001 treatment group had
significant reduced fibrosis compared to gemcitabine alone

S1). In this study, we have used AsPC1 PDAC cell
lines and CD133+ AsPC1 cells were approximately 1
% of total AsPC1 cells (Figure 4A). In addition, other
studies have been reported that PDAC stem cells are
thought to make up 1-5% of pancreatic tumor cells [5].
Kure et al. examined the expression of cancer stem cell
markers (CD24, CD44, CD133, CXCR4, ESA, Nestin)
in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and PDAC
by using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry
(FCM) [36]. In the report, proportion of CD133-positive
cells in PDAC was 0.54±0.54%. Also, CD133-expressing
cells in PDAC cell lines such as PANC1, MIA PaCa2 and
KLM1 were 1.61%, 0% and 0%, respectively [36].

tumor model, AsPC1 CD133+mice, the body weight was
rapid and significantly decreased in gemcitabine single
treatment whereas GV1001+gemcitabine group was not;
Figure 4B, p=0.0258. Also, there were no statistically
significant tumor volume changes among the different
treatment groups (Figure 4C). However, there was a
definite trend that gemcitabine and GV1001+Gemcitabine
groups had tumor volume loss while control and GV1001
groups have gradual increase of their tumors.
Followed by Masson’s Trichrome staining, intense
fibrosis was observed in the tumors of gemcitabinetreated mice, and additional GV1001 treatment reduced
the fibrosis (Figure 5A and 5B). At the end of treatment,
blood sample of each study mouse was acquired and
analyzed for the fibrosis-related cytokines; IL-6, TNF-α
and IL-1β (Figure 5C-5E). The levels of TNF-α and
especially IL-6 were significantly increased in gemcitabine
alone treatment group. The concentration of IL-6 was
considerably decreased by GV1001 in a combination

with gemcitabine (Figure 5C). TNF-α level also tended
to decline by gemcitabine and GV1001 combination
(Figure 5D). Although the concentration of IL-1β did
not show statistically significant differences among the
treatment groups, tendency towards increase or decrease
by gemcitabine and GV1001 treatments was observed
like IL-6 and TNF-α (Figure 5E). Furthermore, it has been
reported that pancreatic stellate cells are the principal
source of fibrosis in the stroma and interact closely with
cancer cells to create a tumor favorable environment that
stimulates local tumor growth and distant metastasis.
Alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) is the cytoskeletal
protein marker for pancreatic stellate cell activation [35].
Therefore, we examined stellate cells marker, α-SMA
in CD133+ AsPC1 xenograft tumor tissues after the
treatment (Figure 5F-5G). There was a large amount of
stellate cells highly expressing α-SMA were observed in
gemcitabine alone group, and it was remarkably decreased
in gemcitabine+GV1001 group (Figure 5G).

of xenograft tumor specimens after the sacrifice.
Moreover, xenograft PDAC models from AsPC1 and
CD133+AsPC1 PDAC cells had significant body weight
loss in gemcitabine single treated group compared to
gemcitabine+GV1001 treatment group (Figure 4B). Also,
the group of mice treated with gemcitabine only became
very cachexic and their activities became significantly
low compared to gemcitabine+GV1001 treatment group.
Those observations lead us to measure the concentration
of ghrelin, a hunger hormone, in the blood of each group
of mice. Its level was lower in gemcitabine-treated mice,
and GV1001 combination increased the level of ghrelin.
However, Ghrelin level difference between Gemcitabine
only group vs. gemcitabine+GV1001 group was not
statistically significant. This result was provided in
Supplementary Figure S2; data not shown in result section.
With relevance to cachexia, the concentration of Ghrelin, a
hunger hormone, was measured in the blood of each group
of mice. Although it was not statistically significant among
the groups, there was a tendency of increment in serum
level of ghrelin in GV1001 containing treatment groups. It
seems that the significance of body weight change between
gemcitabine only group and gemcitabine+GV1001 group
is related with the anti-cachexic effect of GV1001.
However, the precise mechanism should be further
investigated.
The most interesting finding in this study
was GV1001 effect on stroma of PDACs and its
microenvironment. Both treatment groups, gemcitabine
alone and gemcitabine combined with GV1001, had
significant reduction in tumor size, and abundant apoptosis
were observed from the xenograft tumor specimens after the
sacrifice. Although both treatment groups had significant
tumor cell death, tumor specimens of gemcitabine alone
treatment had severe fibrosis whereas gemcitabine
combined with GV1001 treatment showed significant loss
of fibrosis (Figures 3 and 4). Therefore, above observations
lead us to study further with the mechanism of GV1001
affecting fibrosis. As we all know, one of the most difficult
obstacles which preventing treatment success of PDACs
is an early metastasis with rapidly progressive nature, but
other immunological and stromal factors are as important
as to be overcome [38, 39]. Since chemotherapeutic agents
are often administered systemically, drug delivery to solid
tumors consists of several processes, including transport
via blood vessels, transport across the vessel wall into
surrounding tissue, and transport through interstitial space
[40]. Among solid tumors, drug delivery to pancreatic
tumors is especially difficult because the network of tumor
stroma and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins imposes
a barrier for drug delivery. A dense stromal reaction has
been shown to impede the penetration of chemotherapeutic
agent into PDACs, thus restricting the synergistic potential
of chemotherapy [41]. The fibroblasts and fibrotic stroma
in pancreatic tumors inhibit the formation and the function
of blood vasculature. The spare vasculature is only partially

DISCUSSION
GV1001 is a telomerase-based cancer vaccine made
of a 16-mer TERT peptide, an attractive target for cancer
vaccination and the main purpose of this study was to
explore the effect of GV1001 when it was combined with
gemcitabine in the treatment of PDAC. There were several
valuable findings from this study which I would like to
address and they are the followings.
First of all, it was observed that GV1001 did not
have direct effects on the proliferation nor the apoptosis
of PDAC cells in vitro experiments and we could say
that GV1001 did not show direct anti-cancer effects
(Figure 1). It can be explained that GV1001, telomerase
peptide vaccine whose mechanism was known to activate
combined CD4/CD8 T cell response and it would depend
on antigen-presenting cells (APC) [27]. Therefore, it did
not show any direct anti-cancer effect in vitro experiment.
On the other hands, PDAC xenograft mice model
showed that treatment groups with gemcitabine alone
and gemcitabine combined with GV1001 had significant
tumor reduction compared to other groups (Figure 2D
and 2E). Although gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine with
GV1001 treatment groups had significantly decreased
tumor size and volume, there was no significant difference
between the two groups. It seemed that anti-cancer effect
came from gemcitabine since GV1001 alone treatment
group did not have significant reduction in tumor size. In
addition, we have created the PDAC stem cell xenograft
tumor model with CD133+ AsPC1 cell line (Figure 4).
PDAC stem cells are known to be highly chemo-resistant
and responsible for early recurrence and metastasis [36,
37]. We could also find out that CD133+ AsPC1 xenograft
tumor treated with gemcitabine alone and gemcitabine
combined with GV1001 had significant amount of reduced
tumor size and abundant apoptosis from the evaluation

functional and physically separated from the cancer cells
by stroma. This unique microenvironment diminishes the
drug delivery via blood perfusion and therefore reduces
the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy that relies
on functional vasculature for delivery to tumor cells
[12]. Several studies were reported that the improvement
of vasculature or the depletion of stroma enhanced
drug delivery in PDACs. The delivery and efficacy of
gemcitabine in mouse pancreatic model was improved by
co-administration of a drug that depletes tumor-associated
stromal tissue by inhibition of the Hedgehog cellular
signaling pathway [42]. The combination of an agonist
CD40 antibody with gemcitabine chemotherapy showed
tumor regression in both PDAC patient and genetically
engineered PDAC mouse model. CD40-activated
macrophages rapidly infiltrated tumors, became tumoricidal
and facilitated the depletion of stroma [39]. Vitamin
D receptor (VDR) is expressed in stroma from human
pancreatic tumors and that treatment with the VDR ligand
calcipotriol markedly reduced markers of inflammation
and fibrosis in pancreatitis and human tumor stroma.
VDR acts as a master transcriptional regulator of PSCs
to reprise the quiescent state, resulting in induced stromal
remodeling, increased intratumoral gemcitabine, reduced
tumor volume, and a 57% increase in survival compared to
chemotherapy alone [43]. Freig et al reported in a trial of
an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that
objective responses were reported in malignant melanoma,
renal-cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
ovarian cancer, but there were no responders among the
14 patients with advanced PDACs [38, 44]. The relatively
poor response in immunotherapy efficacy of PDACs might
be related to specific carcinoma-associated fibroblasts
(expressing fibroblast activation protein), which secrete
C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12) and thus stop T cells
from accessing cancer cell regions in the stroma [44,
45]. In a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC
blocking the receptor of CXCL12, induced rapid T cell
accumulation and synergized with anti-PD-L1 in cancer
cell killing [44]. Above observations supported that PDAC
xenograft tumors responded to GV1001 by reducing tumor
fibrosis when they were treated with gemcitabine.
Having massive fibrosis reactions in treatment of
gemcitabine alone group from the xenograft PDAC tumors,
we have measured blood level of IL-6, TNF-α and IL1β. Surprisingly, these cytokine levels were elevated in
gemcitabine alone treatment group, whereas, they were
decreased in gemcitabine with GV1001 combination group
(Figure 4D-4F). Moreover, this study showed novel effect of
GV1001 which was never been reported in PDAC studies.
The mechanism responsible for the fibrosis development
in pancreatic cancer has not yet been fully elucidated. In
recent years, the activation of pancreatic stellate cells
plays a critical role in the pancreatic fibrosis, and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6
were considered as important candidates for stellate cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activation [46-48]. Especially, IL-6 is assumed to participate
in pancreatic fibrosis by activating PSCs and regulate
PSC-induced EMT and alterations in gene expression in
pancreatic cancer cells [49]. On the other hands, GV1001
was subsequently revealed to show anti-inflammatory
effects. In a mouse ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)
model, this peptide, GV1001 efficiently inhibited the
production of IL-6 and MCP-1, which are associated with a
decrease in the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages
in the kidney after IRI [50]. Recently, our group reported
that GV1001 decreased the production of TNF-α, IL1β, and IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
rheumatoid arthritis patients through the suppression of
p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation [51]. Taken together, the
increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such
as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in gemcitabine-treated PDAC
xenograft mice was suppressed by GV1001 treatment,
which decreased the activation of pancreatic stellate cells
and reduced fibrosis. Thus, it seems that the increased
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α,
IL-1β, and IL-6 in gemcitabine-treated PDAC xenograft
mice was efficiently suppressed by GV1001 treatment,
which decreased the activation of pancreatic stellate cells
and consequently reduced fibrosis.
We could find out GV1001 decreased the levels
of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 as well as the population of
activated pancreatic stellate cells. Thus, it seems that the
increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such
as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in gemcitabine-treated PDAC
xenograft mice was efficiently suppressed by GV1001
treatment, which decreased the activation of pancreatic
stellate cells and consequently reduced fibrosis. The
potential sources of these cytokines would be pancreatic
epithelial cells, pancreatic cancer cells, pancreatic stellate
cells and innate immune cells like macrophages [52,
53]. Especially, it was reported pancreatic acinar cells
expressing TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 activate PSCs [54-56].
Furthermore, tumor-infiltrating macrophages were known
to be related with ECM remodeling and cancer fibrosis
[57]. Recently, it was reported that CD40 activation on
macrophages released interferon-γ and CCL2 and induced
MMP-dependent fibrosis degradation in pancreatic
carcinoma, resulting in the enhanced chemotherapy
efficacy [39, 58]. Therefore, it should be more investigated
the target cells of GV1001 and its related mechanism.
Here, we report GV1001 did not have direct anticancer effects on PDACs, however, GV1001 combined
with gemcitabine treatment showed significant loss of
fibrosis in tumor tissue as well as tumor cell death and it
might be the key component to understand the possible
synergistic effects of anti-cancer drug delivery in PDAC
treatment. Here, we would like to address that GV1001
might have robust effects in enhancing drug delivery and
become a promising tool to overcome chemo-resistance in
a treatment of PDACs.

Seoul National University Hospital (#13-0717) and Seoul
National University (#131008-3). All animal procedures
were in consistent with the “Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals” issued by the Institute of Laboratory
Animal Resources Commission on Life Science, US
National Research Council.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
cells (PDAC cells)
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines, PANC1 and
AsPC1 were obtained from Korea Cell Line Bank and
maintained in RPMI1640 medium (WELGENE, Daegu,
Korea) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and antibiotics
(100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Life
Technologies). They were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2.
AsPC1 cells were cultured, and stained with anti-CD133
antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany)
for 15 min on ice with rotation. Followed by washing with
a buffer (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.01% sodium azide)
twice, CD133+ AsPC1 cells were isolated by FACSAria (BD
Bioscience). Isolated CD133+ AsPC1 cells were incubated
in CO2 incubator, and subcultured for tumor xenograft.

Establishment of PDAC xenograft tumor model
and treatment
To generate tumors, human PDAC cells (PANC1,
AsPC1, CD133+ AsPC1, 1 x 106 cells/50 μl PBS) were
subcutaneously inoculated with 50 μl of Matrigel in both
sides of buttocks. All mice were divided into 4 groups
randomly with 5 mice in each group. The treatment was
began after 10 days from the PDAC cell injection with
confirmation of gross xenograft tumor in each mouse: (i)
control (vehicle alone), (ii) gemcitabine (twice-a-week
intraperitoneal injection at 125 mg/kg for 2 weeks), (iii)
GV1001 (every day subcutaneous injection at 50 μg/ea for
2 weeks), (iv) gemcitabine (twice-a-week intraperitoneal
injection of at 125 mg/kg for 2 weeks) and GV1001 (every
day subcutaneous injection at 50 μg/ea for 2 weeks). The
body weight and the tumor size of each mouse were
measured using electronic scale and caliper. Tumor
volume was calculated by the following formula: tumor
volume = (length x width2) x π/6 [34].

Apoptosis determination
PANC1 and AsPC1 were cultured and divided
into 3 groups according to the treatment: (i) Control, (ii)
GV1001 (20 μM), (iii) GV1001 (40 μM). After treatments
for 24 hrs, PDAC cells were washed with cold PBS and
then resuspended in 1× Annexin V binding buffer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) at a concentration of
1×106 cells/ml. After PDAC cells (1×105 cells/tube) were
incubated with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) for 15 minutes on ice in the dark, 7-AminoActinomycin (7-AAD, BD Biosciences) was added to tube
containing cells before analysis. The degree of apoptosis
was analyzed by flow cytometry, and the proportion
of stained cells in each quadrant was quantified with
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Blood sample and cytokine measurement
Blood samples were collected from the infra-orbital
venous plexus with heparinized capillary at the time of
sacrifice, and centrifuged with 14000 rpm for 30 min at
4°C. Quantikine human enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kits for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor
necrosis factor TNF-α were purchased from R&D systems
(Minneapolis, MN, USA). Analyses were performed
according to the manufacture's protocol for each ELISA
kit, assayed in triplicate, and read on a Molecular Devices
microplate reader at 450 nm (Menlo Park, CA, USA).

Cell proliferation assay
AsPC1 cells were plated into 96-well plates at a
density of 2x104 cells/well and cultured in the presence or
absence of GV1001 in various concentrations from 5 μM
to 100 μM for 24 hrs. Cell proliferation was then measured
with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay (Dojindo,
Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Absorbance values were measured using the
microplate reader and SoftmaxPro software (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Harvest and histological examination of the
xenograft tumor tissue
The mice were immediately sacrificed after the 2
weeks of treatment protocol. Tumors were excised, fixed
with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C and processed
for paraffin embedding. Tissue sections (5 μm thickness)
were prepared using a microtome, and placed on glass
slides. Serial sections were cut from paraffin-embedded
tumor tissues, and stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin
(H&E) and Masson’s trichrome (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Animals
Seven-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were
purchased from Chung-Ang Laboratory Animal (Seoul,
Korea). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free
conditions, and a γ-ray-irradiated laboratory rodent diet
(Purina Korea, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) and autoclaved

Masson’s trichrome–stained sections were evaluated
to quantify the amount of fibrosis calculating the area
occupied by blue-stained collagen using ImageJ program.
Otherwise, tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene
and hydrated with alcohol series. Then, antigenic retrieval
was performed by heating with 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH
6.0) under microwave after hydration. Followed by
blocking endogenous peroxidase with H2O2 and inhibiting
nonspecific signals with 5 % goat serum, sections were
incubated with primary antibody against alpha-smooth
muscle actin (α-SMA, 1:100, Sigma) at 4°C overnight in
a humidified chamber. Then, sections were incubated with
a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (Vector laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 hr at room temperature.
And then ABC solution (Vector laboratories) was loaded
on sections for 30 min. DAB kit (Vector laboratories)
was used for chromogenic detection. Subsequent to
dehydration and clearing, the sections were mounted with
DPX mountant (Fluka, St. Louis, MO, USA) and observed
with light microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA).
The number of anti-alpha-SMA (α-SMA) immunoreactive
stellate cells was evaluated by pathologist. Ten random
fields of high-magnification (x400) of light microscope
were searched to detect α-SMA immunoreactive fibroblast
in each case.
