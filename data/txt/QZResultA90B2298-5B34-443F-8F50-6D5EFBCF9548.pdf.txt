Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are caused by activating mutations in the KIT or PDGFRA receptor
tyrosine kinase genes. Although >85% of GIST patients treated with the small-molecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) achieve disease stabilization, complete remissions are rare and a substantial proportion of
patients develop resistance to imatinib over time. Upregulation of soluble, non–chromatin-bound histone
H2AX has an important role in imatinib-induced apoptosis of GIST cells. Additionally, H2AX levels in untreated GIST are maintained at low levels by a pathway that involves KIT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the
ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this study, we asked whether bortezomib-mediated inhibition of the ubiquitinproteasome machinery could lead to upregulation of histone H2AX and GIST cell death. We show that
bortezomib rapidly triggers apoptosis in GIST cells through a combination of mechanisms involving H2AX upregulation and loss of KIT protein expression. Downregulation of KIT transcription was an underlying mechanism for bortezomib-mediated inhibition of KIT expression. In contrast, the nuclear factor-κB signaling
pathway did not seem to play a major role in bortezomib-induced GIST cell death. Significantly, we found that
bortezomib would induce apoptosis in two imatinib-resistant GIST cell lines as well as a short-term culture
established from a primary imatinib-resistant GIST. Collectively, our results provide a rationale to test the
efficacy of bortezomib in GIST patients with imatinib-sensitive or -resistant tumors. Cancer Res; 70(1); 150–9.

Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. They
are caused by activating mutations in the KIT or PDGFRA
receptor tyrosine kinase genes (1–3) and can be effectively
treated with the small-molecule kinase inhibitor imatinib
mesylate (Gleevec; ref. 4). However, although >85% of
patients with metastatic GIST benefit from imatinib therapy,
complete responses are rare, and the majority of patients
develop resistance to imatinib during the course of treatment (4–6).

Various second- and third-line therapies for GIST are being developed, with most of them targeting the oncogenically
activated kinases KIT and PDGFRA. However, sunitinib (Sutent), a multitargeted compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, RET, colony-stimulating
factor-1 receptor, and FLT3 in addition to KIT/PDGFRA, is
thus far the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved compound for the treatment of imatinib-resistant
GIST (7–9). The most prevalent mechanisms of resistance
to imatinib involve additional (secondary) mutations of KIT
or PDGFRA that affect the conformation of the kinase domain (10–12), and only a subset of these imatinib-resistant
mutations are sensitive to sunitinib. The efficacy of sunitinib
and other ATP-competitive direct inhibitors of KIT/PDGFRA
is further hampered by genomic heterogeneity of resistance
mutations within each individual patient. Moreover, virtually
all patients receiving imatinib or sunitinib for metastatic inoperable GIST have persistent measurable disease, indicating
that KIT-inhibitory treatments may induce quiescence rather
than apoptosis in a subset of cells, as suggested recently (13). It
is therefore imperative to identify novel strategies for treating
GIST, particularly using drugs that induce GIST cell apoptosis.
We have previously shown that upregulation of soluble
histone H2AX induces apoptosis in imatinib-treated GIST
cells (14). We found that in untreated GIST cells, H2AX levels
are regulated by a pathway that involves KIT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery.
Hence, we ask here whether it would be possible to upregulate

Bortezomib in GISTs

levels of histone H2AX to induce GIST cell apoptosis by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation.
Bortezomib (Velcade) is a dipeptide boronic acid inhibitor of the 20S proteasome, which is FDA approved for the
treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma
(15–17). The therapeutic activity of bortezomib results, in
part, from impeding the degradation of proapoptotic factors,
thereby inducing programmed cell death in neoplastic cells
(18). In multiple myeloma, a key consequence of bortezomib
treatment seems to be inhibition of the transcription factor
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB; refs. 16, 19).
In the present study, we tested the activity of bortezomib
in GIST cells and found profound proapoptotic effects at
concentrations similar to those showing activity against multiple myeloma in vitro. Bortezomib treatment increased histone H2AX expression and, unexpectedly, also resulted in a
significant downregulation of KIT mRNA levels and subsequent protein expression. Inactivation of the NF-κB signaling
pathway, however, did not play a major role in GIST cell apoptosis. Hence, our findings suggest that bortezomib has a
dual mode of action against GIST cells involving upregulation of proapoptotic histone H2AX and downregulation of
oncogenic KIT. Most importantly, bortezomib was active
against imatinib-resistant GIST cells and a short-term culture derived from an imatinib-resistant GIST in vitro. Future
studies are warranted to test the clinical effectiveness of bortezomib in GIST patients.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and inhibitor treatments. The human GIST
cell line GIST882 was derived from an untreated metastatic
GIST and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15%
fetal bovine serum (Gemini BioProducts), 1% L-glutamine, 50
units/mL penicillin (Cambrex), and 50 μg/mL streptomycin
(Cambrex) as described earlier (20). GIST430 and GIST48
were established from GISTs that had progressed during
imatinib therapy after initial clinical response. As described
previously (21), GIST430 and GIST48 cell lines have heterozygous primary KIT exon 11 mutations accompanied by secondary imatinib-resistant mutations in exons 13 and 17,
respectively.
The short-term culture GIST004 was established from a
patient with a clinically imatinib-refractory GIST that underwent surgery for removal of a progressing lesion at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian Hospital,
Pittsburgh, PA (Institutional Review Board protocol no.
0509050). The fresh tumor specimen was disaggregated with
scalpels and incubated overnight at 37°C in a solution containing DNase and collagenase B. Following the enzymatic
disaggregation, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in RPMI 1640, and plated in 35-mm dishes. After
growing to near confluency, cells were treated as indicated
for 72 h and processed for protein extraction. Sequencing
of the tumor and short-term culture DNA (22) revealed a primary KIT exon 11 deletion (del550-558) as well as a secondary imatinib-resistant mutation in KIT exon 14 (T670I), also
known as the “gatekeeper mutation” (23).

Cells were treated with bortezomib (dissolved in DMSO;
LC Laboratories) at concentrations ranging from 1 nmol/L
to 10 μmol/L for up to 72 h. Imatinib mesylate (kindly provided by Novartis Pharma) was used at a final concentration
of 1 μmol/L in DMSO. α-Amanitin (Sigma) was reconstituted
in distilled water (dH2O) and used at concentrations ranging
from 0.1 to 5 μg/mL for up to 72 h. The IκB inhibitor Bay 117082 (Sigma), the heat shock protein-90 (HSP90) inhibitor 17N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG; EMD), as
well as the proteasome inhibitors MG-132, MG-262 (both
Boston Biochem), epoxomicin (EMD), and ZL3VS (Biomol)
were used at a final concentration of 1 μmol/L in DMSO
for up to 72 h or as indicated. Human recombinant tumor
necrosis factor α (TNF-α; Sigma) was reconstituted in PBS
and used at 0.1 μmol/L for 24 h.
Immunologic and cell staining methods. Protein lysates
of GIST monolayer cultures (24) were prepared by scraping
cells into radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [1% NP40,
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmol/L sodium fluoride,
30 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmol/L sodium molybdate, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate]
containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL
leupeptin, and 1 μmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).
Lysates were incubated for 1 h with shaking at 4°C and then
cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad). Thirty micrograms of protein were loaded on a
4% to 12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane.
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown on coverslips were briefly washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells
were then washed in PBS and permeabilized with 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 15 min (room temperature) followed
by washing in PBS and blocking with 10% normal donkey
serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 15 min (room temperature). Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber and incubated
for another 3 h at 37°C the next morning. After a brief wash
in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-anti-mouse or FITCanti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch)
for at least 2 h at 37°C, washed with PBS, and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector
Laboratories). Cells were analyzed using an Olympus AX70
epifluorescence microscope equipped with a SpotRT digital
camera.
Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Invitrogen/Zymed Laboratories), ubiquitin (BD Biosciences),
mouse monoclonal phospho-H2AX S139 (Upstate/Millipore),
H2AX (Bethyl Laboratories), phospho-KIT Y703 (Invitrogen/
Zymed), KIT (DakoCytomation), phospho-RNA polymerase II
S2 (Covance), phospho-RNA polymerase II S5 (Covance),
RNA polymerase II (Covance), cyclic AMP response elementbinding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP; Santa Cruz),
p300 (Santa Cruz), phospho-IκB-α S32, IκB-α, phospho-NFκB p65 S536, NF-κB p65 (all Cell Signaling), and actin
(Sigma).

assays (Applied Biosystems) and a real-time PCR system
(LightCycler, Roche). β-Actin cDNA (also measured using
TaqMan gene expression assay) served as reference gene
for relative quantification.
In vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays, flow
cytometry. Cell viability studies were done using the
CellTiter-Glo luminescence-based assay (Promega) as described previously (21). For these studies, the cell lines
were plated at 15,000 to 40,000 cells per well in a 96-well
flat-bottomed plate (Falcon), cultured in serum-containing
medium for 1 to 3 d, and then incubated for 72 h with
bortezomib, imatinib, or DMSO-only solvent control.
Luminescence was measured with a Veritas Microplate Luminometer (Turner Biosystems), and the data were normalized to the DMSO-only control group. All experimental
points were measured in triplicate wells for each plate
and were replicated in at least two plates.
Apoptosis was assessed by measuring caspase-3 and
caspase-7 activity using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 luminescence-based assay (Promega) as described previously (21).
Experimental conditions were as described above for the
CellTiter-Glo studies.
For flow cytometry, cells were treated with bortezomib at
the indicated concentrations for 24 or 48 h and resuspended
in 100 μL of staining solution containing Annexin V-FITC (525
nm) and 7-AAD (675 nm) in HEPES buffer. After incubation at
room temperature for 15 min, Annexin V–positive cells were
estimated by flow cytometry, as described previously (21). Ten
thousand events of each sample were acquired on a Beckman
Coulter FC500 Flow Cytometer. Doublet discrimination was
done with FL2 versus FL2 peak histogram.

Results
Bortezomib induces apoptosis in GIST cells. To determine whether bortezomib affects GIST cell proliferation
and viability, GIST882 cells were treated with bortezomib
at increasing concentrations. Substantial inhibition of proliferation was found at concentrations of 0.01 μmol/L and
higher (Fig. 1A). To assess induction of apoptosis, GIST882

cells were treated with 0.001 to 10 μmol/L bortezomib for
72 hours and immunoblotted for PARP. A PARP cleavage
fragment indicating apoptosis was detected in cells treated
with concentrations as low as 0.01 μmol/L (Fig. 1B, left),
which is the same concentration that led to a substantial
reduction in cell growth and induction of apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells (16). A 72-hour time course experiment
using this concentration (0.01 μmol/L) showed that induction of apoptosis is time dependent and started at 24 hours
after beginning bortezomib treatment (Fig. 1B, right). Induction of apoptosis was also time-dependent when evaluated
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Fig. 1C). Quantification of apoptotic cells revealed a statistically significant increase of apoptotic cells to 14.5%, 48.9%, and 60.6% after 24,
48, and 72 hours of treatment, respectively, compared with
control-treated cells that had corresponding apoptotic indices
of 1%, 1%, and 2.8%, respectively (P ≤ 0.002, P ≤ 0.0001, and
P ≤ 0.0006, respectively; Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results
show that bortezomib has profound proapoptotic activities in
GIST cells.
Bortezomib upregulates histone H2AX and causes a
rapid loss of KIT expression. To determine the mechanism
of bortezomib-induced GIST cell apoptosis, we analyzed
H2AX levels by immunoblotting and found that both phosphorylated and total histone H2AX protein expression increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2).
The increase in phospho-H2AX and total H2AX levels
paralleled the increase in general ubiquitylation of proteins
(data not shown). We also detected a second, higher molecular weight band (∼24 kDa in size) that most likely corresponds to ubiquitylated histone H2AX, indicating that
increased levels of H2AX after bortezomib treatment are
possible mechanisms of apoptosis induction. When downregulating H2AX by small interfering RNA (siRNA), however, the percentage of surviving cells after bortezomib
did not increase to the same extent seen after imatinib
treatment (data not shown; ref. 14). These results suggest
that additional mechanisms may be involved in bortezomibinduced GIST cell apoptosis.

Bauer et al.

In line with this notion, we found that KIT protein expression levels were dramatically downregulated in a doseand time-dependent manner after bortezomib treatment
(Fig. 2). As expected, KIT phosphorylation decreased in
parallel.
It is known that most GIST cells are dependent on continued KIT expression for their survival as evidenced by the fact
that KIT knockdown by siRNA or downregulation of KIT using the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG readily causes GIST cell
death (14, 21). Hence, downregulation of KIT could play a
substantial role in bortezomib-induced apoptosis in GIST.
Bortezomib induces transcriptional downregulation of
KIT. To further dissect the role of proteasome inhibition
in bortezomib-induced GIST cell apoptosis, we treated
GIST cells with several other proteasome inhibitors. Treatment with all compounds tested (MG-132, MG-262, epoxomicin, and ZL3VS), which, like bortezomib, predominantly
inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome,
led to an increase of phospho-H2AX and total H2AX levels
as well as downregulation of KIT expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results suggest that the effect
of bortezomib on GIST cells is most likely mediated by
its ability to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the
proteasome.
To analyze the events that are involved in the downregulation of KIT expression, we then tested whether bortezomib
leads to transcriptional inhibition of KIT. KIT mRNA levels
were substantially downregulated in GIST882 cells that were
treated with 0.01 μmol/L bortezomib for 48 hours as
shown by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A, left) and qRT-PCR (Fig. 3A,
right). Remarkably, downregulation of KIT transcripts by
0.01 μmol/L bortezomib as determined by qRT-PCR was
comparable to that observed when cells were treated with
1 μg/mL α-amanitin, a potent and selective inhibitor of
RNA polymerase II.
We then tested the effects of bortezomib on the transcriptional machinery in GIST cells. Immunoblotting for
RNA polymerase II phosphorylation at serine 2 (S2) of the
tandem heptad repeats of its COOH-terminal domain
showed a substantial decrease in phosphorylation after
bortezomib treatment that was dose and time dependent
(Fig. 3B, left and middle). Phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (S2) is associated with transcriptional elongation (24).
The same pattern was seen when probing for RNA polymerase II phosphorylation at serine 5 of the COOH-terminal domain, which occurs predominantly during transcriptional
initiation. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II (S2) after bortezomib could also be visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B, right), showing loss of RNA polymerase II
(S2) phosphorylation.
To directly test the effect of transcriptional inhibition on
KIT expression in GIST cells, we performed a dose-response
experiment treating GIST cells with increasing amounts of αamanitin. As expected, α-amanitin led to a dose-dependent
decrease of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (S2) and
RNA polymerase II (S5; data not shown). Interestingly,
α-amanitin treatment resulted in complete loss of KIT
protein expression at concentrations of 1 μg/mL and higher,

154

Cancer Res; 70(1) January 1, 2010

indicating that KIT is highly regulated at the transcriptional level (Fig. 3C).
In addition to downregulating RNA polymerase II, bortezomib also led to downregulation of the transcriptional coactivator CBP as shown by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3D,
left). DMSO-treated cells (97.8%) showed positivity for CBP in
the form of so-called nuclear speckles, whereas only 44.1% of
the cells were positive when treated with 0.01 μmol/L bortezomib (Fig. 3D, right). Negative cells showed either a complete
loss of CBP expression or redistribution of CBP into displacement foci that are associated with global transcriptional
downregulation. The effect of bortezomib was comparable
with treatment of GIST882 cells with 1 μg/mL α-amanitin
(100% CBP positive in controls to 39.4% in cells treated with
α-amanitin; Fig. 3D, right). Taken together, the global displacement of RNA polymerase II and CBP from chromatin
throughout the nucleus suggests that bortezomib leads to a
general transcriptional shutdown rather than to a specific
loss of RNA polymerase II from the KIT promoter. Our results
therefore indicate that bortezomib causes downregulation of
KIT by inhibition of the transcriptional machinery.
Control experiments in which we treated GIST882 cells
with imatinib or the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG revealed a rapid
loss of KIT phosphorylation, but no change in KIT protein
levels after imatinib (Supplementary Fig. S2A, left). In contrast, 17-AAG led not only to a loss of KIT phosphorylation
but also to a loss of KIT protein expression (Supplementary
Fig. S2A, right; ref. 21). Treatment with imatinib was associated with an inhibition of ongoing transcription (Supplementary Fig. S2A–C), whereas 17-AAG treatment resulted in an
increase of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation at S5 (Supplementary Fig. S2B, right), indicating that bortezomib and
imatinib differ substantially from 17-AAG with respect to
the effects on the transcriptional machinery. In addition,
imatinib led to an increase in the abundance of KIT mRNA,
whereas 17-AAG resulted in a >2-fold decrease of KIT transcripts as determined by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
The most likely explanation for these seemingly discrepant results is the effects of these compounds on posttranscriptional
modifications that result in differences in mRNA stability.
To explore the role of NF-κB in bortezomib-induced GIST
cell death, we treated GIST882 cells with the IκB inhibitor
Bay 11-7082, which had no effect on apoptosis as judged by
the lack of a PARP cleavage fragment (Supplementary
Fig. S3A) or on levels of H2AX or KIT protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Furthermore, treatment of GIST882
cells with bortezomib had no effect on NF-κB signaling as
measured by IκB-α and NF-κB phosphorylation in whole-cell
lysates (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Most importantly, NF-κB
p65 was cytoplasmic at baseline levels, indicating that it is
not constitutively active in GIST882 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3C and D). Treatment with either bortezomib or Bay
11-7082 did not lead to a change in subcellular localization
of NF-κB over a period of 72 hours (Supplementary Fig. S3C
and D). By contrast, stimulation with TNF-α readily resulted
in nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Supplementary Fig. S3C
and D), thus indicating that the pathway is nevertheless
functional in GIST882 cells.

Collectively, these findings underscore that bortezomib has
unique effects on KIT mRNA levels, global transcriptional activity, and KIT protein levels when compared with imatinib or 17AAG, and that modulation of the NF-κB pathway does not play
a major role in bortezomib-induced apoptosis in GIST cells.
Bortezomib induces apoptosis and downregulates KIT
in imatinib-resistant GIST cells. We next determined the efficacy of bortezomib in imatinib-resistant GIST cells. GIST48

0.003 and 0.002 μmol/L for GIST48 and GIST430, respectively
(Fig. 4A and B, top left). By contrast, the IC50 was not reached
when treating GIST48 or GIST430 with imatinib at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 10 μmol/L (Fig. 4A and B, top left). A
dramatic 5- to 12-fold increase in apoptosis was seen in

staining at the same concentrations and time points (Fig. 4A
and B, right).
These preclinical validations of bortezomib as a novel therapeutic option in imatinib-resistant GIST were extended
through evaluations in primary cultures established from an
imatinib-resistant GIST. Mutational analysis of this tumor
revealed a primary KIT exon 11 deletion (del550-558) and a secondary imatinib-resistant mutation in exon 14 (T670I). Shortterm cultures were treated with 0.01 μmol/L bortezomib or
1 μmol/L imatinib for 72 hours. As shown by immunoblotting,
bortezomib induced apoptosis in these cells as indicated by
PARP cleavage, whereas imatinib had only a minor effect
(Fig. 4C). Moreover, levels of phospho-H2AX and total H2AX
increased after bortezomib treatment (data not shown). In
concordance with our previous results, KIT and phosphoKIT (Y703) were downregulated after bortezomib treatment,
whereas levels of KIT protein as well as KIT phosphorylation
were largely unchanged when treated with imatinib (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
Although GISTs can be successfully treated with imatinib
mesylate, new therapeutic options are needed because complete responses are rare and more than 80% of the patients
develop resistance to the drug over time (4–6). Based on our
previous finding that histone H2AX, which is causatively involved in the induction of apoptosis after imatinib, is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery (14), we tested
the possibility of using the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for treating GIST. We found that bortezomib
had a potent proapoptotic effect on GIST cells at the same
concentrations used in multiple myeloma models, a disease
for which bortezomib has clinical benefit (15, 16). Notably,
the bortezomib-induced GIST apoptosis was preceded not
only by upregulation of histone H2AX but also by downregulation of KIT oncogene mRNA levels.
Our current study supports the hypothesis that upregulation
of histone H2AX by inhibition of the proteasome can induce
apoptosis. However, downregulation of H2AX by siRNA only
led to a moderate increase in surviving cells after bortezomib
treatment (data not shown), suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved in the induction of apoptosis. Our finding that bortezomib treatment of GIST cells resulted in
significant downregulation of KIT protein, accompanied by
loss of KIT tyrosine phosphorylation, lends important support
to this notion. It is known that loss of the KIT protein has a
strong apoptotic effect in GIST cells as seen after knocking
down KIT with siRNA or treatment with HSP90 inhibitors
(14, 21). It is therefore likely that downregulation of KIT contributes substantially to the effect of bortezomib on GIST cells.
Interestingly, downregulation of BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells has been described after treatment
with various proteasome inhibitors in vitro (25). Although the
underlying mechanism was not shown, transcriptional inhibition was suggested as a potential explanation (25).
It is known that GISTs are especially prone to transcriptional
inhibition (26). We have shown previously that treatment with
the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin led to an apoptotic

www.aacrjournals.org

response in GIST882, whereas nontransformed fibroblasts
were not affected (14). We show here that bortezomib causes
a transcriptional downregulation of KIT (Fig. 3A). We show
that bortezomib treatment is associated with an inhibition of
the global transcriptional machinery, including downregulation of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation as well as loss of
the transcriptional coactivator CBP from chromatin throughout the nucleus. These findings indicate that bortezomib leads
to a general transcriptional shutdown rather than to a specific
loss of RNA polymerase II from the KIT promoter. Interestingly,
it has been shown in BCR-ABL–positive CML cells that combination treatment of bortezomib with flavoperidol leads to transcriptional inhibition and loss of phosphorylation of the
COOH-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (27). However,
the effect of either agent given alone was less pronounced
(27). The mechanisms by which bortezomib downregulates
KIT oncogene transcription are incompletely understood. It
is known that the 26S proteasome is associated with transcriptionally active genes and physically interacts with RNA polymerase II (28). In fact, several studies have shown that
ubiquitin-proteasome machinery is involved in regulation of
transcriptional activation (29, 30), with initial binding and subsequent proteasomal degradation of transcriptional activators
being necessary to initiate transcription and transcriptional
elongation (31–34).
The dichotomous effect that bortezomib has on H2AX and
KIT expression levels can most likely be explained by differences in the mechanism of protein degradation between
H2AX and KIT. H2AX is processed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and its levels increase after treatment with a
proteasome inhibitor. However, the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of KIT is mediated by the lysosome (35).
This process is unlikely to be inhibited by compounds that
target the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. Hence, bortezomib treatment does not affect ongoing KIT degradation,
which, together with reduced transcription (Fig. 3), results
in a significant loss of KIT protein expression.
Inactivation of NF-κB through retention in the cytoplasm
is thought to be a key mechanism of bortezomib-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma (16, 19). We provide evidence
that inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway does not seem
to play a major role in bortezomib-mediated GIST cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
It is likely that transcriptional inhibition of KIT expression is
not the only mechanism leading to apoptosis in GIST cells after
bortezomib treatment. We are currently testing whether bortezomib is involved in the regulation of chaperone proteins, such
as HSP90 and HSP70, as well as chromatin modifiers, such as
histone deacetylases, which could also result in the downregulation of KIT protein. Interestingly, bortezomib has been shown
to modulate the abundance of DNMT1, a DNA methyl transferase, in acute myeloid leukemia cells, leading to changes in
DNA methylation and gene expression (36). Although increased
DNA methylation would not explain the transcriptional
downregulation of KIT, a change in methylation patterns could
lead to the reexpression of other cell cycle inhibitory or proapoptotic genes that were epigenetically silenced in GIST cells,
thus providing additional antiproliferative or cytotoxic stimuli.

Because most imatinib-resistant GISTs develop secondary
mutations within the KIT or PDGFRA kinase domains, novel
therapeutic approaches that do not directly target these
kinases are particularly important. The example of HSP90
inhibitors, which likewise lead to loss of KIT oncoprotein expression in GIST, supports this notion (21). In that respect,
our results that bortezomib is effective against GIST cells harboring various resistance mutations, including the so-called
gatekeeper mutation, seem especially promising.
Further support for this notion comes from preliminary experiments, in which we treated heterozygous KitK641E transgenic mice (37) with bortezomib. After 2 or 4 weeks of treatment,
some resected tumors showed loss of Kit expression, downregulation of cyclin A, and upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 by
immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates (data not shown). These
promising results indicate that bortezomib indeed has an effect
in vivo. However, a larger cohort of animals needs to be treated
for a longer period of time to confirm these preliminary results.
In summary, we have shown that bortezomib induces apoptosis in imatinib-sensitive as well as imatinib-resistant
GIST cells. We identified a dual mode of action for bortezomib, including stabilization of histone H2AX as well as transcriptional downregulation of KIT. Our results provide a
compelling rationale for clinical trials to test the efficacy of
bortezomib in GIST patients.
