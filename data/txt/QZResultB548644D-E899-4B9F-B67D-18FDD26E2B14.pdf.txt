Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generally a fatal disease due to a paucity of effective treatment options.
The identification of oncogenic microRNAs that exert pleiotropic effects in HCC cells may offer new therapeutic targets. In this study, we have identified the human microRNA miR-191 as a potential target for HCC
therapy. Inhibition of miR-191 decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and significantly
reduced tumor masses in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of HCC. Additionally, miR-191 was
found to be upregulated by a dioxin, a known liver carcinogen, and was found to be a regulator of a variety
of cancer-related pathways. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for miR-191 targeting as a rational
strategy to pursue for improving HCC treatment. Cancer Res; 70(20); 8077–87. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miR) are a class of small RNA molecules that
regulate gene expression (1). Their activity is a result of duplex
formation between the miR and the 3′ untranslated region
(UTR) of targeted mRNAs. This results in translational silencing
by either mRNA degradation or translation blocking. Expression studies indicate significant changes in miR expression in
different disease states compared with normal tissue (2). Specifically, several studies have reported that various miRs are deregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples
relative to nontumor liver controls (3–10). HCC is the fifth most
common cancer in the world, and the third leading cause of
cancer deaths with poor prognosis in most cases. Standard chemotherapy usually has no beneficial outcome on HCC patients.
Sorafenib was recently approved for use in HCC and shown to
increase survival by 3 months (11). It is still extremely important
to search for new therapeutic modalities and novel therapeutic
targets to generate effective therapies for this fatal disease. Because miRs are master regulators of gene expression, their deregulation in diseases can trigger changes that lead to the
disease phenotype, and the modulation of their activity can
be a key to the development of novel therapies.
In this study, we propose the involvement of miR-191 in
HCC. miR-191 was previously identified as being upregulated

in some solid tumors, but not in HCC, and no functional or
mechanistic data were reported (12, 13). We show that miR191 is upregulated in liver cancer tissue and that its inhibition by a 2-O-metoxyethyl (MOE) anti-miR can reverse the
cancerous phenotype of human HCC cells, both in vitro
and in vivo. Thus, this compound has the potential of being
a novel therapeutic for HCC. We also propose a role for
miR-191 in the mechanism, toxicity, and carcinogenesis of
dioxins, a family of environmental pollutants, and show the
involvement of this miR in cancer-related pathways.

Materials and Methods
miR expression profiling
Patients and samples. Southeast Asian samples were received as fresh-frozen tissues from Dr. Jung Hwan Yoon
(Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South
Korea). Samples were taken from 30 HCC patients and included tumor and adjacent to tumor tissue from each patient. Caucasian samples were purchased from Indivumed
GmbH as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. Institutional review approvals were obtained for all samples in
accordance with each institute's Institutional Review Board
(IRB) or IRB-equivalent guidelines.
RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using the miRvana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples was isolated from
7- to 10-μm-thick tissue sections as previously described (14).
EZ-RNA II kit (Biological Industries) was used for total RNA
extraction from cell lines.
MicroRNA microarray platform. Samples were measured
using custom miR microarrays as previously described (14).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for miRs.
Samples were measured by quantitative real-time PCR as
previously described (15).

Anti-miR chemistry
2′-MOE–modified oligonucleotides were synthesized by Isis
Pharmaceuticals as previously described (16) on AKTA Oligopilot 10 (Amersham/GE Healthcare) oligonucleotide synthesizer
and purified by ion exchange chromatography on an AKTA
Explorer (GE Healthcare) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system on a strong anion exchange column. AntimiRs were characterized by ion-pair HPLC mass spectrometric
analysis with Agilent 1100 MSD system. The anti–miR-191 sequence was AGCTGCTTTTGGGATTCCGTTG and the negative
control anti-miR was ACATACTCCTTTCTCAGAGTCCA,
which is the reverse complement sequence of miR-122a with
six mismatches, thus being an irrelevant sequence.
Tissue culture work
Cell growth and transfections. Hep3B, SNU423, and
HepG2 cell lines were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection. Cells were grown under standard growth
conditions. Transfection of cells with anti-miRs was done using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) or with Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) when both anti-miRs and vectors were
transfected, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Induction of miR-191 expression by TCDD in tissue
culture. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) from
Supelco (Sigma) in toluene was diluted in DMSO to
1 μmol/L concentration. Cells were grown and treated with
10 nmol/L TCDD in serum-free media. Exposure to TCDD
was for 24 to 48 hours.
Cell proliferation assay. Cells were transfected with antimiR at a concentration range of 20 to 300 nmol/L, in triplicates. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were tested
for proliferation using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution
Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Caspase-3/7 activation. Cells were transfected in triplicates with 50 to 200 nmol/L anti-miRs. Apoptosis was assessed
by measuring caspase level 24 hours after transfection using
Apo-ONE Homogenous Caspase-3/7 Assay kit (Promega).
Dual-luciferase reporter assay. Reverse complement sequences to selected miRs were inserted into the 3′-UTR of
Renilla luciferase in psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega). Cells were
transfected in triplicates with the vector or cotransfected with
a vector and an anti-miR. Luminescence was assayed 24 and
48 hours later using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Results were normalized to the constitutively expressed firefly
luciferase from the same vector and shown as the ratio between the various treatments and cells transfected with a
nonmodified vector.
Cancer pathway reporter array. Cignal Finder 10-Pathway
Reporter Array (SABiosciences) was used. Reverse transfection
technique was implemented. Cells were treated with anti–miR191 or negative control anti-miR. Relative firefly luciferase
activity was calculated and normalized to the constitutively
expressed Renilla luciferase.
3′-UTR reporter assay for miR target validation. Cells
were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids harboring the complete 3′-UTR of the desired gene (SwitchGear

Genomics), and the relevant treatment of anti-miR or
miR-mimic. Luminescence was assayed 24 hours later using
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Results were normalized
to a signal from a control vector harboring nonrelevant
sequence of 2,500 bp (R01 control from SwitchGear) and
shown as the fold change between miR-191 and a negative
control treatment for both the mimic and the anti-miR
treatments. t test was performed for wells from multiple
experiments, and we compared populations of the mimictreated cells with a mimic control and anti-miR–treated
cells with anti-miR control for each gene vector.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. HepG2 cells
were treated with TCDD at 10 nmol/L. Cells were than fixed
and prepared for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).
The immunoprecipitation was performed at Genepathway,
and the binding of chromatin to the precipitated transcription factor (TF) was quantified by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR).
Affymetrix arrays. RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells
transfected with anti–miR-191 or negative control anti-miR,
and from untreated cells. mRNA expression was measured
onto GeneChip Affymetrix arrays at the Biological Services
Unit, Weizmann Institute.
In vivo orthotopic model. Animal experiments were conducted at Harlan Biotech Israel. The study was performed
following an application form review and approval by the
Committee for Ethical Conduct in the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were provided with ad libitum diet and
free access to water. HepG2 cells were mixed with Matrigel
Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences) and injected
s.c. to BALB/c nude male mice. Subcutaneous tumors were
harvested and implanted intrahepatically. Anti-miR administration (50 mg/kg) was done by a total of 19 repeated i.p. injections every other day, starting 2 days after induction and
continued throughout the entire observation period. At day
40 after orthotopic tumor implantation, the study was terminated; tumor mass, liver, and spleen were excised and
weighed. The significance of the differences of tumor sizes
was calculated by a two-sided rank sum test.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumor sections were immunostained using rabbit
monoclonal antibody to Ki67 (Abcam). Three nonoverlapping
fields per section/sample were photographed, and Ki67positive and Ki67-negative tumor cell nuclei were counted.
Proliferation index was calculated as the ratio of Ki67positive cells from the total number of cells counted per each
field.

Results
Expression of miRs in HCC, selecting the potential
miR targets
Comparing miR expression profiles in biopsy samples of
HCC and adjacent noncancerous liver tissues from patients
(Table 1A) revealed several differentially expressed miRs
(Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 1B and C). The miRs that were
upregulated or highly expressed in tumors were selected for

miR-191, with small change in all other miRs. B, Hep3B cells treated with anti–miR-191 showed increase in activation of caspase-3/7 compared with cells

screening in in vitro proliferation assays in cell lines using
anti-miRs with MOE chemical modification. IC50 values were
calculated from proliferation assays in two HCC cell lines:
Hep3B and SNU423 (Table 1B). Among the miRs with significant differential expression, only a few miRs showed potential as drug targets for HCC therapy. The inhibition of these
miRs by MOE-modified anti-miRs caused changes in cellular
phenotype such as reduced proliferation and increased
apoptotic response in a dose-dependent manner. One of
the promising miRs was miR-191, which was found to be
upregulated in HCC and expressed at a higher level in HCC
cell lines compared with immortalized normal hepatocytes
(THLE-2; data not shown).
In vitro activity of anti–miR-191
The reduction of miR-191 level following its inhibition was
tested in Hep3B cells treated with an anti-miR specific for
miR-191. miR expression was studied using total RNA extracted from anti-miR–treated and control-treated cells by
custom-made miR microarray. Detecting miRs in anti-miR–
treated cells or tissues can lead to artifactual results because
of anti-miR presence. Hence, we performed control experiments that show that the MOE anti-miR was not simply blocking detection of miR-191. Only minor changes in the

8080

Cancer Res; 70(20) October 15, 2010

expression of other miRs were observed, whereas miR-191 levels were reduced in the treated cells (Fig. 1A). Similar results
obtained for SNU423 cells are shown in Supplementary Data.
Changes of cellular phenotypes such as increased caspase
activation and reduced proliferation after miR-191 inhibition
are shown in Fig. 1B and C. Hep3B cells were transfected
with increasing amounts of anti–miR-191 or a negative control anti-miR. Cells exhibited reduction in proliferation following anti–miR-191 transfection, but not in the presence
of a negative control anti-miR, indicating no general toxic effect associated with anti-miRs of this type or the transfection
reagents. The proliferation inhibition of anti–miR-191
showed an IC 50 of 100 and 75 nmol/L for Hep3B and
SNU423, respectively. Caspase-3/7 activation also increased
with increasing concentration of anti–miR-191, indicating
apoptosis induction following miR inhibition.
To verify that the anti-miR specifically inhibits miR-191, a
reporter assay using dual-luciferase vectors was performed in
which the reverse complement sequence of miR-191 was
cloned into the 3′-UTR of the reporter. Endogenous miR191 represses the reporter expression by ∼40% (Fig. 1E),
and the cotransfection of the reporter vector together with
anti–miR-191 causes derepression of the reporter. The
response is specific because the control anti-miR could not

abolish the miR regulation of the reporter. Moreover, the endogenous miR-191 did not change the expression of the reporter transcribed from a control plasmid harboring an
altered 3′-UTR with a nonrelevant sequence. The same system was also tested with a miR-mimic for miR-191, which
completely repressed reporter expression, whereas a control
mimic did not. These results show the specificity of the miR
activity and the specificity of the inhibition of miR-191 by
anti–miR-191.
Transcriptional regulation of miR-191 by dioxin
To elucidate possible pathways underlying miR-191 upregulation in HCC patients, we studied the transcriptional regulation of this miR by examining its transcription unit and the
TFs that can in part govern it transcription. Studies to date
have shown that mature miR expression can be altered by regulation of its biogenesis steps (e.g., Drosha and Dicer activity;
refs. 17, 18), as well as by transcriptional activation (19, 20).
Location of the transcription start site (TSS) was predicted
according to known transcripts, expressed sequence tags, and
CpG islands, and it was found that miR-191 is transcribed at an
intronic region of the gene DALR anti-codon binding domain
containing 3 (DALRD3; RefSeq NM_018114). We searched for
TF binding sites (TFBS) in a region covering ±2,000 bp from

the TSS, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/AhR nuclear
translocator (Arnt) TFBS motif (21) was predicted at location
chr3:49034919-49034937. ChIP assay was conducted to validate the TFBS and the involvement of this TF in the transcriptional regulation of this miR. TCDD that belongs to a family of
environmental pollutants (dioxins; Fig. 2A) was used as an activator for the TF because it is a known ligand for AhR (22) and
activates this TF to induce the expression of CYP1 proteins
(Fig. 2B; ref. 23). CYP1A1 was chosen as a positive control gene
in the ChIP assay. This gene has two TFBS for the AhR/Arnt TF
in its promoter, and therefore, both were tested in the assay.
Figure 2C summarizes the results of the ChIP assay using a
specific antibody for AhR. AhR was found to bind the promoter of miR-191 transcript, with or without the TCDD activation; hence, it is suggested that miR-191 upregulation can
be regulated by this promoter. When HepG2 cells treated
with TCDD were studied for their miR expression by miR
microarray, miR-191 expression was shown to be elevated
2.4-fold in treated cells after 48 hours, as seen in Fig. 2D.
miR-181a, miR-181b, and miR-181a*, all found in one genomic cluster, were also upregulated, and studying their promoter revealed an AhR/Arnt TFBS on one of the genomic loci
of this cluster. This is the first demonstration of miR involvement in the toxicology of dioxins.

AhR activation by TCDD. C, ChIP assay for AhR validated the binding of the TF to the promoter of miR-191. Two binding domains for CYP1A1 served as
positive control. D, HepG2 cells treated with 10 nmol/L TCDD exhibited increased miR-191 and miR-181 cluster expression compared with untreated cells.

Pathway and miR target modulation by anti–miR-191
RNA from cells transfected with anti–miR-191 was studied for mRNA changes using GeneChip array (Affymetrix)
that includes 28K annotated genes. Upregulated genes from
cells treated with anti–miR-191 were compared with both
untreated cells and cells that were treated with a negative
control oligonucleotide (both controls showed similar expression results). The false detection rate was set stringently at 0.05 and resulted with 184 genes significantly
upregulated. The list of upregulated genes is added to Supplementary Data. Looking at the top list of upregulated
genes, 4-fold and up (Table 2), showed enrichment of 8.8fold (P = 0.0145) for miR-191 predicted targets (predicted by
TargetScan).

We then studied the consequences of treating cells with
anti–miR-191 on 10 major cancer-related pathways using a
dual-luciferase reporter system (SABiosciences), consisting
of vectors with regulatory elements for key genes downstream in those pathways. Figure 3A shows the reporter relative expression between cells treated with anti–miR-191 and
a negative control oligonucleotide. The pathways most influenced were mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (P < 0.0007), transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β; P < 0.01), and MAPK/c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (P < 0.03). Those pathways are important
for human hepatocarcinogenesis (24) and are part of the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Because the
inhibition of miR-191 led to changes in those pathways, we

searched for direct targets among the genes related to those
pathways. Figure 3B shows overlap of genes from populations of mRNA upregulated 2-fold or more after miR-191 inhibition (from the Affymetrix GeneChip), predicted targets of
miR-191 (from the union of TargetScan and Miranda), and
genes in affected pathways (from KEGG and NetPath). Four
overlapping genes were found from the three populations:
SOX4, CRK, IRAK2, and PDGFB. We have constructed luciferase plasmids with the complete 3′-UTR of each gene at the
3′ end of firefly luciferase (SwitchGear), for those four genes
and for additional potential genes from those populations, to
search for a direct miR-191 target. Each plasmid was cotransfected into cells with either treatment of anti–miR-191 or
miR-191 mimetic and relevant controls. Reporter signal that

increased with anti-miR and decreased with miR mimetic
relative to the same effect on a negative control plasmid
was considered direct miR-191 targets. Figure 3C is a heat
map of the results showing fold change in the reporter assay
for the selected genes, for the mimic and anti-miR treatments, comparing with same treatments with the negative
control vector. Of the four overlapping genes, only SOX4 reporter was significantly upregulated after anti-miR (P = 0.01)
treatment and downregulated after miR-mimic treatment
(P = 0.004). However, IL1A and TMC7 were also significantly
changed in the same manner (P = 2 × 10−6 and P = 0.004 for
anti-miR treatment and P = 0.04 and P = 0.001 for the miRmimic treatment, respectively). Those genes are therefore
considered to be direct miR-191 target genes.

is significant compared with mice treated with negative control anti-miR (P = 0.00014) seen on day 40 of the experiment after organ harvesting and
weighing. B and C, liver and spleen weight are not changed between the two groups, meaning no obvious toxicity is seen. D, miR-191 expression measured
by qRT-PCR in the harvested tumors shows a significant reduction in miR-191 expression (P = 1.7 × 10−7) in the tumor tissue of the treated mice.
Expression is calculated as 50 − normalized Ct. E, proliferation index measured by the ratio of Ki67 positively stained cells from total cells is shown to be
reduced in tumors taken from anti–miR-191–treated animals (P = 0.026).

In vivo efficacy of anti–miR-191 in orthotopic
HCC model
An orthotopic liver xenograft model was established to
test the activity of anti–miR-191 in vivo and evaluate its potential as a therapeutic agent in HCC. HepG2 cells were used
to create subcutaneous xenografts in donor nude mice.
Those subcutaneous tumors were harvested and fragmented,
and pieces were implanted into livers of acceptor nude mice
to generate orthotopic tumor xenografts. Two days after surgery (tumor implant), the mice were subjected to every other
day i.p. injections of oligonucleotide. Two groups of 15 mice
each were treated with either anti–miR-191 or a negative
control anti-miR. The experiment was conducted for 40 days,
after which livers, tumors, and spleens were harvested and
weighed. Figure 4A shows the significant decrease of tumor
mass at day 40 in animals treated with anti–miR-191, in comparison with the group that received the negative control anti-miR. Liver and spleen weights showed no significant
difference between the groups (Fig. 4B and C). This experiment was conducted in two independent in vivo studies, both
resulting with a statistically significant tumor reduction in
animals treated with anti–miR-191 (data of second experiment are added to Supplementary Data). miR-191 expression

was decreased in the tumors harvested from animals treated
with anti–miR-191 (Fig. 4D). These tumors showed a significant reduction of the fraction of proliferating cells revealed
by Ki67 (MKI67; RefSeq NM_002417) immunostaining
(Fig. 4E; images are added to Supplementary Data).

Discussion
miRs are considered to have great potential as therapeutic
targets because by nature they are master regulators of gene
expression and therefore of cellular pathways (25, 26). Deregulation of miRs was shown to be present in different disease
conditions. Inhibition of one miR can result in a vast effect
within a cell and can alter significantly the cellular phenotype
because it can change several genes that are direct targets of
the miR, as well as genes influenced by those direct targets.
Therefore, miR inhibition or replacement can be a key factor
in the treatment of various disease conditions (26).
HCC is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. It occurs
predominantly in developing countries, but nevertheless, incidence is on the rise in Western countries as well (27). The
pathophysiology of HCC is not yet fully understood because
the hepatocarcinogenesis process is complex and HCC has a

heterogeneous nature. Many pathways may be involved in
the carcinogenic process of HCC, and as miRs were shown
to be deregulated in HCC in many previous studies, we investigated the involvement of miRs in this process.
The inhibition of one of the upregulated miRs in HCC,
miR-191, was found to induce cellular changes in HCC cell
lines that triggered proliferation inhibition and apoptosis.
The inhibition of the miR was found to be potent and specific. We also found that miR-191 is upregulated after TCDD
activation, a carcinogen from the dioxin family. The involvement of miRs in the mechanism of TCDD activity can explain
the downregulation of several genes seen on expression arrays performed on cells following TCDD treatment (28, 29).
This is in contrast to the study by Moffat and colleagues (30)
that showed only moderate changes in miR expression in response to TCDD, in rodent models, and concluded that miRs
do not play a role in dioxin toxicity. Dioxins are a family of
environmental pollutants that are known to have multiple
hazardous effects. TCDD is a very potent carcinogen, causing
adverse biological responses such as developmental defects,
immunotoxicity, and more (31). The mechanism for the carcinogenic effect of dioxin is not yet fully understood. It is an
AhR ligand, and its effects are thought to be mediated
through the activation of AhR (22). On ligand binding, the
AhR translocates to the nucleus and associates with Arnt
to form a heterodimer that binds to an enhancer site on
the DNA designated as xenobiotic-responsive element and
is responsible for transcriptional activation of a variety of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism (Fig. 2B; ref. 32).
This response presumably evolved to be able to detect a wide
range of chemicals and facilitate their biotransformation and
elimination in the detoxification process. However, toxic responses are also elicited by AhR activation, either by the production of toxic intermediate metabolites or by aberrant
changes in global gene expression that lead to adverse
changes in cellular processes. Microarray analysis showed
that TCDD induces changes in epidermal growth factor receptor and MAPK pathways that can explain part of its toxicities and carcinogenicity (28, 33). Although the induction of
the AhR by dioxins is well characterized, the function and
mechanism of some of its toxicities are still unknown and
require further study.
The downstream effect of miR-191 inhibition was studied
to elucidate the pathways miR-191 is involved in and to study
the mechanism in which miR inhibition can alter the pathway to induce a potential curative effect in HCC. We studied
those effects in several stages. First, we analyzed the differences in gene expression at the mRNA level using GeneChip
array by Affymetrix, comparing the expression of anti–miR191–treated cells with cells treated with a negative control
anti-miR. Extensive changes in gene expression were observed, with a significant enrichment in genes that are predicted targets of miR-191. We also looked for changes at
protein levels using reporter systems because miRs also alter
gene expression at the protein level by translation inhibition
without major changes in mRNA level (34, 35). To identify the
major pathways that are affected by miR-191, a reporter assay was used. TGF-β and MAPK pathways were found to be

www.aacrjournals.org

most affected. These pathways play a significant role in hepatocarcinogenesis (24). The TGF-β pathway regulates cell
proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion (36). The MAPK
signaling pathway is also involved in diverse cellular processes such as cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (27),
and the overexpression of members of this pathway was
found to be correlated to HCC (37). Interestingly, the MAPK
pathway, altered by anti–miR-191, was the one reported to be
mostly influenced by dioxins (33), strengthening the findings
of involvement of miR-191 as a key regulator of this pathway.
Analyzing the overlapping genes from the affected pathways together with the mRNA upregulated after miR-191 inhibition in the Affymetrix array and predicted target genes
for miR-191 resulted with a list of potential direct target
genes for miR-191. We have tested the genes from this list
using a luciferase reporter assay with constructs harboring
the full 3′-UTR of those potential targets. It is important to
note that because miRs are considered master regulators of
gene expression, the expectation is that more than one or
even just a few genes would be affected directly. This is also
exemplified in our enrichment of miR-191 predicted targets
in the upregulated genes in anti–miR-191–treated cells.
Therefore, the miR-191 targets that we validated are believed
to be only part of the complex response to miR-191 regulation and the first attempt to identify its direct targets that
are involved in HCC. It is our view that the concerted action
of a vast number of genes whose expression is affected by
miR-191 inhibition is the cause for the phenotype change
and the efficacy we are witnessing after anti–miR-191 treatment. Among the genes we have tested, three genes were
shown to be direct miR-191 targets.
SOX4 (RefSeq NM_003107) is a TF responsible for embryonic cell development and regulates cell differentiation,
proliferation, and survival. SOX4 was found to be upregulated in many cancers and was even thought to induce
metastasis in HCC (38). However, it was recently found
that SOX4 acts as a DNA damage sensor and is required
for p53 tumor suppressor activation (39). By this mechanism, SOX4 promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and
inhibits tumorigenesis in a p53-dependant manner. This
activity can be the reason for the beneficial outcome we
have observed by its upregulation after miR-191 inhibition.
IL1A (RefSeq NM_000575), which was also validated as being a direct target of the miR, is a member of the interleukin-1 cytokine family. This gene is involved in various
immune responses, inflammatory processes, and hematopoiesis and is known to induce apoptosis. It was found
to be polymorphic in many diseases. Interestingly, polymorphism in its miR-122 binding site at the 3′-UTR
was found to be related to HCC (40). TMC7 (RefSeq
NM_024847) belongs to a family of ion channels and has
two predicted binding sites for miR-191 in its 3′-UTR.
However, not much is known about the activity of this
gene in HCC. CRK, IRAK2, and PDGFB, all of which have
predicted binding sites for the miR and were shown to be
upregulated at the mRNA level after miR-191 inhibition,
did not show any reporter expression changes with either
anti-miR or miR-mimic treatments. We concluded that

these genes participate in the changes anti–miR-191 induces
in an indirect way. Hence, the orchestration of all those cellular changes is the cause of the efficacy achieved by miR-191
inhibition. Figure 3D shows a schematic representation of
how the involvement of both the direct targets of miR-191
and the genes that are changed indirectly leads the cancerous
cells into apoptotic fate, and how the survival and proliferation paths are inhibited.
The effectiveness of in vivo miR inhibition in cancer models was already shown, but studies to date showed only
changes in tumor size when cells were transfected with
anti-miR ex vivo and then injected to produce the tumor
model. Such studies were done in glioma (41) or breast
cancer (41, 42). In a model for prostate cancer, miR inhibition
was shown to be effective after intratumoral injections of
anti-miR (43). This was also seen with intratumoral injections of anti–miR-21 in a subcutaneous xenograft of tongue
squamous cell carcinomas (44). In a model of glioblastoma,
miR inhibition was shown to effect angiogenesis, but no
change in tumor mass was observed (45). Adeno-associated
virus–mediated replacement of miR-26a was shown to be
effective in a murine liver cancer model (46).
In our study, we established an orthotopic human liver
xenograft model where tumor fragments are implanted in
the liver of mice and the anti-miR is administered systemically
(i.p.), therefore reaching the tumor after entering the bloodstream and thus imitating the delivery methods used with
human cancer therapeutics. We show that with repeated injections of the anti-miR, a significant inhibition of tumor growth
was observed at day 40, without observed toxicity. The level
of the endogenous miR-191 in the tumors of anti–miR-191–
treated mice was decreased, as well as the cell proliferation
marker Ki67. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses
a systemic route of administration of an anti-miR to show
therapeutic effects on the growth of a primary solid tumor.

This study shows the identification of a specific miR that is
upregulated in HCC as a potential therapeutic target for this
disease. We propose that miR-191 is relevant for HCC treatment because its inhibition caused decreased cell proliferation and tumor growth. Furthermore, the study also
extended our understanding on how this miR can be involved in TCDD toxicity. In addition, miR-191 was found to
be involved in pathways known to be important for tumor
progression and growth, showing the potential of anti–
miR-191 as a cancer therapeutic. There are currently many
MOE-modified antisense oligonucleotides in human clinical
trials (47). Therefore, the MOE-modified anti–miR-191 serves
as a potential therapeutic compound, as it passively reaches
the liver and tumor implant, inhibiting miR-191 efficiently
and causing no observed toxicity in the animals. We conclude that miR-191 inhibition using a MOE-modified antimiR is of high potential for the treatment of HCC patients.
