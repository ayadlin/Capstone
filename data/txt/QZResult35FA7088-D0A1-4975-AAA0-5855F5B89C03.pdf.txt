ABSTRACT
Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 respectively driving polarization of T helper (Th)
1 and Th17 cells has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of both multiple
sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study,
we first constructed, expressed and purified a novel human truncated IL12rβ1-Fc
fusion protein (tIL12rβ1/Fc) binding multiple forms of the p40 subunit of human
IL-12 and IL-23. tIL12rβ1/Fc was found to effectively ameliorate MOG35–55-induced
EAE through reducing the production of Th1- and Th17-polarized pro-inflammatory
cytokines and suppressing inflammation and demyelination in the focused parts.
Moreover, tIL12rβ1/Fc suppressed Th1 (IFN-γ+ alone) and IFN-γ+ IL-17+ as well as
the population of classic Th17 (IL-17+ alone) cells in vivo. Furthermore, tIL12rβ1/Fc
ameliorated EAE at the peak of disease via the inhibition of STAT pathway, thereby
causing a prominent reduction of RORγt (Th17) and T-bet (Th1) expression. Notably,
tIL12rβ1/Fc could increase the relative number of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.
These findings indicates that tIL12rβ1/Fc is a novel fusion protein for specific binding
multiple forms of p40 subunit to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects and provides
a valuable approach for the treatment of MS and other autoimmune diseases.

by the IL-12-polarized, interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing
effector CD4+ T cells [3, 4]. Recent studies suggested that
Th17, a distinct CD4+ T cell subset characterized by the
secretion of IL-17 and the dependence on IL-23 for its
expansion, exhibits greater pathogenicity for autoimmune
inflammation of the brain [5, 6]. Importantly, that both Th1
and Th17 cells have been confirmed to induce inflammatory
disease and distinct types of EAE [7, 8].
As is well known, naive T cells cultured in vitro
under polarized conditions generally develop into specific
groups, including those that produce IFN-γ (“Th1”), and
those that produce IL-17 (“Th17”), upon activation [9–11].
Recently Th17/Th1 cells producing both IL-17 and IFN-γ
from inflamed tissues and human peripheral blood were
named [12]. The Th17/Th1 cells not only express RORγt,
but also the master Th1-correlated transcription factor,

INTRODUCTION
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological
disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized
by a variety of clinical symptoms that result in a range of
progressive impairments and disability. To date, some
treatments have been developed on slowing disease
progression and alleviating symptoms but not a cure for
MS [1]. The underlying cause of MS has only partially
been elucidated, but ample findings indicate a central role
for T helper (Th) cells in the pathogenesis of this disease.
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a
T cell-correlated demyelinating disorder of CNS in mice,
has been served as an animal model to assess the fate of MS
progression for years [2]. Historically, both MS and EAE
were considered as Th1-correlated diseases, dominated

T-bet. Moreover, the stimulation of human Th17 clones
in the presence of IL-12 decrease RORγt and increase the
expression of T-bet, enabling these Th17 cells to produce
IFN-γ [13]. IL-23 might drive the expression of IFN-γ in
Th17 cells without a direct correlation with T-bet [14].
Furthermore, the IFN-γ/IL-17A double-positive cells
were enriched in the target organs of several autoimmune
disease models including EAE [15]. Interestingly,
IL-12 induces Th1 cells, while IL-23 promotes the
generation of Th17 cells. IL-12 and IL-23 share the
common p40 subunit. It was reported that blocking
IL-12/23-p40 inhibited the receptor-binding of both IL-12
(a heterodimer of p35 and p40) and IL-23 (a heterodimer
of p19 and p40). Notably, ustekinumab, a humanized
monoclonal antibody inhibiting p40 showed marked
clinical efficacy for the treatment of chronic inflammatory
disorders such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [16, 17].
However, ustekinumab was ineffective against clinical
MS. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new approach
to inhibit IL-12 and IL-23 and prevent polarization of Th1
and Th17 cells for the amelioration of both MS and EAE.
In the present study, we utilized the extracellular
soluble region of the p40 receptor to design a novel human
truncated IL12rβ1-Fc fusion protein (tIL12rβ1/Fc).
We found that tIL12rβ1/Fc specifically and effectively
bound the p40 subunit of IL-12/23. tIL12rβ1/Fc indeed
ameliorated MOG35–55-induced EAE through reducing
the production of Th1- and Th17-polarized proinflammatory cytokines and suppressing inflammation
and demyelination in the focused parts. Furthermore,
tIL12rβ1/Fc reduced transcript factor RORγt (Th17) and
T-bet (Th1) expressions. Moreover, tIL12rβ1/Fc could
increase the relative number of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory
T cells. These findings indicate that tIL12rβ1/Fc could be a
novel fusion protein to exert anti-inflammatory effects and
ameliorate MS and other autoimmune diseases.

using ELISA and RT-PCR (Fig. 1E). Later, the medium
was changed to SFM medium without FBS and the cell
cultures containing tIL12rβ1/Fc protein were purified
by Protein A chromatography. The eluted protein was
obtained with a purity of approximately 90% examined
by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1F) and recognized by anti-hIL12rβ1
mAbs using Western blot (Fig. 1G). The data indicated
that tIL12rβ1/Fc mainly exists in a monomeric form at
the reduced state while forms a dimer at the non-reduced
condition (Fig. 1F and 1G). Of note, the reduced protein
was visibly found near 55 kDa band, not accordance with
its theoretical molecular weight of 50 kDa, presumably
due to the glycosylation modifications in the eukaryotic
expression system (Fig. 1F and 1G).
The binding affinities of tIL12rβ1/Fc protein to
human IL-12 and IL-23 were determined by direct binding
ELISA to give EC50 values of 30.20 and 32.74 nmol/L,
respectively (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, the binding assays of
tIL12rβ1/Fc protein to human IL-27 and IL-35 were also
conducted as controls to confirm the binding specificity,
showing no cross-reactions with our molecule (Fig. 2).
To further assess the binding specificity, much weaker
binding affinity of tIL12rβ1/Fc with mouse IL-12 and
IL-23 was observed due possibly to the sequence
difference (Fig. S1). Together, the binding assays
unambiguously confirmed the specific binding between
tIL12rβ1/Fc and human IL-12 or IL-23, indicating that
the eukaryotically expressed tIL12rβ1/Fc exhibits desired
biological activity.

tIL12rβ1/Fc ameliorated symptoms of MOG35–55induced in correlation with decreased production
of Th1 and Th17 cytokines
The treatment effects of tIL12rβ1/Fc were first
investigated in EAE mouse model, showing that the
administration of tIL12rβ1/Fc can remarkably ameliorate
EAE with several lines of evidence. In the treatment
regimen, tIL12rβ1/Fc administration started from disease
onset in animals (day 9 post-immunization) led to a
significant decrease in disease severity measured by the
mean clinical score or mean maximum clinical score
compared to vehicle control (Fig. 3A and Table 1). In the
prophylactic treatment regimen, tIL12rβ1/Fc administration
started from day 3 before immunization was more effective
in decreasing the clinical score of EAE mice (Fig. 3B and
Table 1). Furthermore, the prophylactic dosing of tIL12rβ1/
Fc also resulted in delayed disease onset (Fig. 3B).
Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive agent
commonly used in the clinical therapy for autoimmune
diseases, was used in the treatment of EAE as a positive
control. In our experiments, the tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment
showed similar effectiveness as CsA under the preventive
regimen (Fig. 3B and Table 1) and even more effective
than CsA under therapeutic protocol (Fig. 3A and Table 1).
In addition, CsA treatment caused obvious loss of body

RESULTS
Construction, expression, and purification of
tIL12rβ1/Fc
We first chose the extracellular soluble region of
IL-12/ 23 receptor fusing with Fc fragment for stronger
stability and easy preparation to bind the p40 subunit of IL12/IL-23. To construct the eukaryotic expression plasmid,
the tIL12rβ1 and IgG1 Fc genes amplified using RT-PCR
were fused and then cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) at the
restriction digestion sites Xho I and Hind III (Fig. 1A and
1B). The correct sequence of tIL12rβ1/Fc fusion
gene was confirmed by restriction digestion (Fig. 1C)
and DNA sequencing. Next, the correctly constructed
plasmid was linearized (Fig. 1D) and then transfected into
CHO-K1 cells using electric transfection method. A stable
expression cell line was obtained after the screening with
the addition of 400 μg/mL G418 sulfate and finally verified

weight of EAE mice. By contrast, tIL12rβ1/Fc-treated
mice had no obvious effect in body weight over the course
of the treatment. This suggested that tIL12rβ1/Fc may
possess less safety concerns. (Fig. S2). The tIL12rβ1/Fc
administration markedly attenuated demyelination and
CD4+T cell infiltration in stimulated spinal cords and
brain sections compared to that of the vehicle group of
EAE mice (Fig. 3C and 3D). The pathological scores
of cerebellum and spinal cord in vehicle-treated and
tIL12rβ1/Fc-treated mice differed significantly (Fig. 3E).
In addition, the infiltration of CD4+ T cells was
substantially decreased in response to tIL12rβ1/Fc
treatment (Fig. 3F).
As expected, the therapeutic effects of tIL12rβ1/Fc
were associated with a significant suppression of p40
concentration in mice (Fig. 4A). This suppression
led to a prominent reduction in the percentage of
Th1, Th17 cells as well as the pathogenic Th17/
Th1 cells in spleens, LNs and brains compared
to  the vehicle control (Fig. 4B and 4D). In addition,
the Th17/Th1 ratio was significantly decreased in
the lesion CNS compared with that in the spleens
and LNs in EAE mice(Fig.  4C). An obvious
elevation of the Th17/Th1 ratio after tIL12rβ1/Fc
administration was also observed (Fig. 4C). tIL12rβ1/Fc
treatment also caused an improvement on the relative
number of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Fig. 4E).
At the same time, the production of both Th1secreated cytokine IFN-γ and Th17-secreated cytokine
IL-17A were remarkably reduced by tIL12rβ1/Fc
treatment (Fig. 5A). Given the critical roles of cytokines in
MS and EAE pathogenesis, the expression of granulocyte
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was also
examined, and GM-CSF level was greatly reduced after
tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment (Fig. 5B). In addition, the mRNA
levels of Th1- and Th17-correlated factors including

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IFN-γ, IL-17A and IL-22 were also significantly decreased
compared to that of control group of EAE mice (Fig. 5C).

tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment changed Th1 and Th17
cell differentiation in vitro
To further delineate whether the effects from
tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment were associated with Th1 or Th17
cell differentiation, purified naive mouse CD4+ T cells were
cultured in the presence or absence of the recombinant
protein in vitro under Th1- or Th17-polarizing conditions.
Consistent with the effectiveness of tIL12rβ1/Fc in animal
experiments, tIL12rβ1/Fc treatments had similar efficacy
as the anti-mouse p40 antibody on inhibiting both mouse
Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation (Fig. 6A). With the
treatment of tIL12rβ1/Fc, cytokine levels of IFN-γ and
IL-17A and mRNA expression of T-bet and RORγt were
also remarkably decreased as shown in Fig. 6B and 6C.
Furthermore, tIL12rβ1/Fc was also confirmed to suppress
the development of human Th1 and Th17 cells in vitro
(Fig. 7A) with a significant reduction of the cytokine
secretion (Fig. 7B). By further examining the expression of
Th1- and Th17- specific transcription factors, we observed
tIL12rβ1/Fc could obviously decrease T-bet and RORγt
mRNA in human PBMCs (Fig. 7C). The data collectively
demonstrated that addition of tIL12rβ1/Fc inhibits both
mouse and human Th1 and Th17 differentiation and the
influence of tIL12rβ1/Fc on Th1 and Th17 differentiation
seemed to act in a dose dependent manner.

tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment inhibited STAT signaling
pathway in the development of Th1 and
Th17 cells
Due to the crucial roles of STAT family in the
differentiation of Th cells, we first hypothesized that the

receptor protein tIL12rβ1/Fc conducts regulatory effects
on Th1 and Th17 development through direct inhibition
on the STAT signaling pathway. To test it, splenic CD4+
T cells from tIL12rβ1/Fc-treated mice or control EAE
mice at day 18 post-immunization (therapeutic protocol)
were analyzed by Western blotting for the expression
or phosphorylation of indicated proteins in the STAT
signaling pathway. As illustrated in Fig. 8A, the expression
of phosphorylated p-STAT4 from Th1 cells and p-STAT3
from Th17 cells was obviously decreased. In addition, the
expression of two key transcription factors, T-bet for Th1
and RORγt for Th17 cells, was also significantly reduced
(Fig. 8B). Additionally, the relative mRNA expression
of IL23R in the tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment group was also
decreased (Fig. 8B), which is in agreement to the reduction
of STAT3 phosphorylation and RORγt expression.

was revealed that expression of phosphorylated IκBα
and phosphorylated p65 was decreased and expression
of IκBα in tIL12rβ1/Fc-treated mice was increased
compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 9A). Consistent
with the modified NF-κB activity, expression levels of
NF-κB-regulated gene products including IL-6, TNF-α
and iNOS were significantly reduced in splenocytes
derived from the tIL12rβ1/Fc-treated mice compared to
those from the vehicle group (Fig. 9B). All data strongly
suggested the involvement of NF-κB signaling pathway
in the development of EAE and the treatment effects by
tIL12rβ1/Fc.

DISCUSSION
During the past decade, highly potent biological
agents targeting TNF-α [19], IL-6 [20] and p40 [21] to
enhance or replace conventional immunosuppressive
therapies have made significant advances in the treatment
of autoimmune diseases. For example, ustekinumab,
a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds the p40
subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, showed excellent efficacy in
the treatment of psoriasis [21, 22]. However, in phase II
clinical trials for MS, ustekinumab did not show obvious
clinical improvements in MS patients [23, 24]. This could
be due to the heterogeneous nature of the p40 subunit to

Since NF-κB signaling pathway is well-known to
involve in the inflammatory process of EAE [18], we
examined whether tIL12rβ1/Fc interferes with this vital
pathway. After analyzing the levels of phosphorylated
IκBα and p65 in splenocytes isolated from vehicle- or

inflammation via up-regulation of TNF-α in microglial
cells [27], suggesting that different forms of p40 may
independently play a key role in CNS inflammation and
demyelination in EAE and MS. In addition, functional
blocking monoclonal antibodies against p40 homodimer
of IL-12 has been found to ameliorate clinical symptoms
and disease progression of adoptive transfer EAE [28].
Nevertheless, given that recombinant IL-12 p80 can also
bind to IL-12Rβ1 [29], the common receptor subunit
shared by the p40 cytokine family simultaneously
targeting IL-12, IL-23, both monomer and homodimer of
p40 might be more advantageous than antibodies against

prevent the antibody fully achieving its recognition and
neutralizing effects. With regard to the ternary structure of
p40, the p40 subunit of IL-12 can function in the form of
both monomer and homodimer in addition to the formation
of heterodimers with p35 and p19, and such a structural
diversity has been proven to be critical for physiological
function and disease progression [25]. The homodimeric
form of IL-12 p40 subunit (p402 or p80) is considered as a
potentially strong candidate to trigger CNS inflammation
and glial activation via the induction of iNOS [26]. Both
monomer and homodimer of IL-12 p40 subunit have
also been reported to contribute significantly to CNS

for MS and EAE. Moreover, utilizing extracellular binding
domains of the receptors could be a more versatile and
effective approach to bind different forms of the ligand,
and consequently producing stronger biological responses.

specificity of tIL12rβ1/Fc targeting multiple forms of p40
subunit may result in safer outcomes when used in MS
patients. Attenuation of demyelination and inflammation
by tIL12rβ1/Fc further supported its potential curative
effects on MS and potentially other autoimmune diseases.
When given immediately after EAE induction (in the
prophylactic dosing regimen), tIL12rβ1/Fc significantly
delayed disease onset, suggesting that tIL12rβ1/Fc could
suppress the early phase of the immune responses. In
humans, Th17/1 cells were isolated from inflamed tissue
of IBD patients and MS lesions [30], suggesting that
these double producers are particularly pathogenic in
tissue inflammation and autoimmunity. Previously, it was
reported that Th17/Th1 and Th1 cells, rather than Th17
cells, play a critical role in disease progression [13]. In
our study, tIL12rβ1/Fc suppressed Th1 (IFN-γ+ alone) and
IFN-γ+ IL-17+ cells as well as the population of classic
Th17 (IL-17+ alone) cells compared to vehicle. These
results differ from the earlier experimental data conducting
in the cGVHD model, indicating that the IL-17 singlepositive (IFN-γ−) cells were not altered with the anti-p40
mAb treatment [31]. The reason for this difference may
be due to the different pathogenesis of the two disease
models.. Until recently, it has not been clear whether
the IL-17+ IFN-γ+ double producers arise from Th1 or
Th17 cells. Annunziato F. et al. [12, 13, 32] provided
evidence for the plasticity of human Th17 cells to shift
to a Th1 profile, whereas Th1 cells seem to be unable to
shift to Th17. In contrast, Kurschus et al. found that a
highly pure Th1-cell population can convert into IFN-γ/
IL-17 double-producing T cells in vivo [33]. Therefore,
clarification of the origin of the double producer cells is of
great importance with regard to the pathogenetic process
of autoimmune, as well as of other chronic inflammatory
disorders. From our experimental data, we found that the
Th17:Th1 ratio is much higher in the peripheral lymphoid
organs such as spleens and LNs than CNS,, suggesting
that the conversion of large numbers of pure Th17 cells
into IFN-γ+ IL-17+ cells in CNS is essential in EAE.
Also, our observation on the elevation of Th17:Th1
ratio after tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment suggested a shift of the
“alternative” Th17 cells to “classical” Th17 cells, which is
supported by the reduction of mRNA level of IL-22.
IL-12 is crucial for Th1 cell differentiation
through STAT4 pathway and the activation of an unique
transcription factor named T-bet [34, 35]. STAT3 and
RORγt are reported to be necessary for differentiation of
the Th17 lineage and sufficient to direct the expression of
the hallmark cytokines of this lineage [36, 37]. Similar
to these results, tIL12rβ1/Fc in this study decreased
STAT4 phosphorylation and T-bet expression during
Th1 differentiation and reduced STAT3 phosphorylation
and RORγt expression in differentiating Th17 cells,
thereby causing a prominent reduction in the expression
of pro-inflammation cytokines.. During the generation
of Th17 cells, IL-23/IL-23R signaling can induce
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RORγt, which further increases IL-23R expression and
IL-23 subsequently synergize with TGF-β to conduct
the transcription of IL-17 and other Th17 lineage
cytokines [38, 39]. With regard to the IFN-γ+ IL-17+
cells, T cells lacking IL-23R failed to develop into these
cells [40]. After tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment, the expression of
IL23R mRNA was also decreased along with the decline
of STAT3 phosphorylation and RORγt expression, further
confirming the rescuing role of tIL12rβ1/Fc during Th17
cell development.
NF-κB is responsible for various biological
processes, including the stimulation of inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) [41, 42]and the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 [43]. Given the importance
of NF-κB in the production of inflammatory cytokines
and the involvement in Th17 cell development, we
examined the effects of tIL12rβ1/Fc on NF-κB signaling
and provided strong evidence that tIL12rβ1/Fc can block
NF-κB signaling via regulation of IκBα expression and
subsequently reduced NF-κB–regulated gene products
including IL-6, TNF-α and iNOS. The hematopoietic
growth factor, GM-CSF, is also important in the
development of EAE and MS [44–46]. Given that the
production of GM-CSF is induced by IL-23 and dependent
on the activity of the IL-12-IL-23 receptor complex and
RORγt [45], the reduction of RORγt through blocking
the interaction of IL-23 by tIL12rβ1/Fc and the decline
of GM-CSF expression in CNS and spleens in this study
strongly illustrate the feasibility and therapeutic potential
of using tIL12rβ1/Fc for effective treatment of MS and
other autoimmune diseases.
Compared to monoclonal antibodies, especially
ustekinumab, the present study indicated that tIL12rβ1/
Fc actually exhibits advantageous features in the EAE
model. Unlike the ineffectiveness by ustekinumab
in rodents EAE, tIL12rβ1/Fc is efficacious in the
amelioration of mice EAE model. A significant attenuation
of demyelination in stimulated brains and spinal cords of
tIL12rβ1/Fc-treated mice was found. However, markedly
different degree of demyelination could not be observed in
the brains between the antibody-treated and vehicle groups
[47]. In addition, the patterns of intracellular IL-12-p40
expression within the CNS white matter did not show
difference between antibody- and vehicle-treated animals
[48]. In contrast, we observed a remarkable suppression of
p40 concentration in lesion CNS as well as in peripheral
lymphoid organs after tIL12rβ1/Fc treatment, suggesting
that targeting p40 by tIL12rβ1/Fc not only directly blocks
the function of released IL-12/IL-23, but also reduces the
actual production of IL-12-p40. These effects by tIL12rβ1/
Fc could be highly beneficial for disease therapy, and
strongly imply the potential on the effectiveness for the
treatment of MS and other human autoimmune diseases.
Between EAE and MS, there are several
discrepancies to prevent straightforward translation of
the efficacy on EAE model to clinical settings. Although
28549

Oncotarget

the factors for these translational failures are multiple
and complicated, a very important fact is that the animal
models such as EAE cannot exactly reflect the complex
diseases in humans, especially the autoimmune-related
ones such as MS [2, 49]. Given that more disease-oriented
animal models and sophisticated technologies are needed
to develop, alternative animal models currently available
for autoimmune diseases, for example, collagen-induced
arthritis (CIA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
should be evaluated to assess the effectiveness of the novel
molecule of tIL12rβ1/Fc. These future investigations will
not only gain more insights into the molecular mechanism
of tIL12rβ1/Fc, but will also expand the scope and
potential utility of this molecule.
In conclusion, we developed a novel fusion protein
tIL12rβ1/Fc and found that tIL12rβ1/Fc bound the p40
subunit of IL-12/23. tIL12rβ1/Fc effectively ameliorated
MOG35–55-induced EAE via reducing Th1- and Th17polarized pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressing
inflammation and demyelination in the focused parts.
tIL12rβ1/Fc reduced RORγt and T-bet expression. These
results suggest that tIL12rβ1/Fc could be a novel fusion
protein to ameliorate MS and other autoimmune diseases.

medium for the selection of monoclonal cell lines. Stably
transfected CHO cell lines were identified using ELISA
and RT-PCR methods.
Later, the medium was changed to the SFM medium
(Gibco, USA) without FBS and protein production was
carried out for an additional 96 h after. Cell culture was
harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min.
The resultant supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm
filter and loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column (GE
Healthcare, USA) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer
(20 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 20 mmol/L Na2HPO4, pH 7.0)
at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Then, the unbound fraction
was removed and the resin was washed with 10 column
volumes of the binding buffer. Proteins specifically bound
to the resin were eluted with 0.1 mol/L Glycine, pH 2.8,
and then immediately neutralized with 1 mol/L Tris HCl
pH 9.0. The purified protein was identified by SDS-PAGE
and Western Blotting.

Assay of binding specificity
The specificity of tIL12rβ1/Fc protein to human
IL-12/IL-23 was examined using a direct ELISA-based
receptor binding assay as previously described [50].
The OD450nm absorbance was plotted against tIL12rβ1/Fc
concentrations and EC50 values were fitted with a singlesite binding model using Prism 5 software (GraphPad,
USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction, expression and purification of
tIL12rβ1/Fc

Animals used in the experiments

Based on the amino acid sequence of human
IL12rβ1 receptor (Genbank NP_005526) and human IgG1
Fc (Genbank AEV43323.1), the human truncated IL12rβ1
receptor (tIL12rβ1) gene containing a signal peptide
sequence (708 bp) and the human IgG1 Fc fragment
(699 bp) was obtained by RT-PCR from human spleen
cDNA library (Biomics, China) using the primers F1,
F2 and F3, F4 (Table 2), respectively. After purification
with Tian-quick midi purification kit (Tiangen, China),
the tIL12rβ1 was ligated with Fc gene using overlap PCR
extension with the primers F1 and F4. The constructed
tIL12rβ1/Fc fragment was digested with Xho I and Hind
III (Takara, China) and then inserted into the eukaryotic
expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, USA).
E. coli DH5α (Novagen, Germany) was transformed with
this recombinant plasmid and the following selection was
conducted on Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with
0.1 mg/mL ampicillin (Sigma, USA).
After verification of correct sequences by restriction
digestion and DNA sequencing (Invitrogen, USA),
the plasmids for cell transfection were prepared using
EndoFree Maxi Plasmid Kit (Tiangen, China) and then
linearized with Pvu I (Takara, China). Next, the linearized
plasmids were transfected into the CHO-K1 cell line
(ATCC, USA) at the logarithmic growth phase using
electric transfection. After 24 h cell culture, 400 μg/mL
G418 sulfate (Invitrogen, USA) was added into the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Eight- to twelve-week-old female C57BL/6 mice
(Comparative Medicine Centre of Yangzhou) were used in
all animal experiments. Mice were kept in a conventional,
pathogen-free facility at the Medical School of Southeast
University. All animal procedures were in accordance
with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals as adopted and promulgated by the United
States National Institutes of Health, and were approved
by the Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Animal Manage
Committee under the Contract SCXK 2012(su)-0004.

Induction and treatment of EAE
Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)
peptide (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK, MOG35–55)
synthesized by GL Biochem, China was dissolved in PBS
at 2 mg/mL and emulsified in an equal volume of CFA
consisting of IFA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) plus 4 mg/mL
heat-inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37
RA, Difco). 200 μl emulsions were injected s.c. into each
mouse over two different sites in the flank. EAE induction
was performed using 200 ng Pertussis toxin in 200 μl
PBS for each mouse via i.v. (tail vein), immediately and
2 d after MOG35–55 immunization. Adjuvant control group
was set up with equivalent PBS instead of MOG35–55 as
a negative control. For the treatment of EAE, tIL12rβ1/

USA). CD4+ T cells were purified by using anti-CD4
magnetic beads (Miltenyi biotech, Germany).

Differentiation of Th cells
For mouse Th1 and Th17 differentiation, naive
CD4+ T cells were stimulated with plate-bound
anti-mCD3 (5 μg/mL, eBioscience, USA) and
soluble anti-mCD28 (1 μg/mL, eBioscience,
USA) under Th17-polarizing conditions (10 ng/
mL mIL-6, R&D, USA, 1 ng/mL mTGF-β, R&D,
USA and 10 ng/mL mIL-23, R&D, USA) or Th1polarizing conditions (10 ng/mL mIL-12, R&D,
USA and 10 mg/mL anti–mIL-4, BD, USA) in the
presence or absence of tIL12rβ1/Fc (10 μg/mL
and 20 μg/mL). For intracellular cytokine detection,
cells were re-stimulated with 1 μl/mL GolgiStop (BD,
USA), 20 ng/mL PMA (Sigma, USA) and 1 μg/mL
ionomycin (Sigma, USA) for another 4–6 h after
72- hour initial activation.
To induce human Th1 and Th17 development,
venous blood was collected from a healthy donator by
a trained nurse under aseptic conditions into sodium
heparincoated Vacutainer tubes (BD, USA) in Zhongda
hospital. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated from leukocyte-rich buffy coats
by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque
(Sigma, USA) and then polarized with plate-bound
anti-hCD3 (5 μg/mL, eBioscience, USA) and soluble
anti-hCD28 (1 μg/mL, eBioscience, USA) under Th17polarizing conditions (10 ng/mL hIL-β, 10 ng/mL hIL-6,
R&D, USA, 1 ng/mL hTGF-β, R&D, USA and 10 ng/mL
hIL-23, R&D, USA) or Th1-polarizing conditions (10
ng/mL hIL-12, R&D, USA and 10 mg/mL anti–hIL-4,
BD, USA) in the presence or absence of tIL12rβ1/Fc
(10 μg/mL and 20 μg/mL). For intracellular cytokine
detection, cells were re-stimulated with 1 μl/mL
GolgiStop (BD, USA), 20 ng/mL PMA (Sigma, USA)
and 1 μg/mL ionomycin (Sigma, USA) for another 4–6 h
after 72- hour initial activation.

Histopathological analysis
Spinal cords and brains for histological analysis
were dissected from mice and immediately fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded 5–10 um sections
of the tissues were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin
(H&E) or immunohistochemistry for CD4 and then
examined by light microscopy. Briefly, inflammation
was scored as follows: 0, none; 1, a few inflammatory
cells; 2, organization of perivascular infiltrates; and
3, increasing severity of perivascular cuffing with
extension into the adjacent tissue. Demyelination was
scored as follows: 0, none; 1, rare foci; 2, a few areas
of demyelination; and 3, large (confluent) areas of
demyelination [51].

Purification of cells
Mice were perfused with 30 mL PBS via the heart
before the isolation of spinal cords and brains. The tissues
were filtered through 70 μm cell strainers (BD, USA) to
yield single-cell suspensions in IMDM containing 10%
FBS (invitrogen, USA). CNS mononuclear cells (MNCs)
were purified using a Percoll (GE Healthcare, USA)
gradient (70/37%).
Spleens and lymph nodes extracted from C57BL/6
mice were teased through sterilized 70 μm cell strainers
(BD, USA) to obtain single-cell suspensions in IMDM
containing 10% FBS (invitrogen, USA) medium. Red
blood cells were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience,
