BACKGROUND: Secondary malignancies including myeloid neoplasms occur infrequently in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to the authors’ knowledge have not been as well documented in adults as in
children. METHODS: A total of 641 patients with de novo ALL who were treated with the hyper-CVAD
(hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) regimen or its variants
were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (2.49%) developed secondary acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) (6 patients) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (10 patients). At the time of ALL diagnosis, the
median age was 53 years; cytogenetics were normal in 11 patients, pseudo-diploidy with del(2) in 1 patient,
t(9;22) in 1 patient, and unavailable in 3 patients. Frontline therapy included hyper-CVAD in 7 patients,
hyper-CVAD with rituximab in 8 patients, and hyper-CVAD with imatinib in 1 patient. Karyotype at time of
AML/MDS diagnosis was 5, 7 in 9 patients, normal in 1 patient, complex in 1 patient, inv(11) in 1 patient,
t(4;11) in 1 patient, del(20) in 1 patient, and unavailable in 2 patients. Secondary AML/MDS developed at a
median of 32 months after ALL diagnosis. Cytarabine plus anthracycline-based treatment was given to 12
patients with AML and high-risk MDS. One patient with MDS received arsenic trioxide, 1 received clofarabine, and 2 received decitabine. Response to treatment was complete remission in 3 patients, partial remission in 6 patients, and no response in 6 patients; 1 patient was untreated. Eight patients (1 with AML and 7
with MDS) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and all but 2 died at a median of 3 months
(range, 0.5-11 months) after transplantation. The median overall survival after a diagnosis of secondary AML

Intensive combination chemotherapy regimens for
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have greatly
improved the outcome of younger patients, with longterm survival rates of > 80% reported in children.1 However, adults with ALL have 5-year survival rates ranging
from 30% to 60%, depending on the risk features present
at the time of diagnosis. Long-term survivors of cancer are
at risk of developing secondary malignancies because of
the effects of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, and
potentially because of an underlying genetic predisposition to malignancies. The cumulative risk of secondary
malignancies after successful treatment of ALL has been
estimated to be 6.27% at 30 years of follow-up for pediatric patients.2-8 In 1 report in adult patients, the risk was
9.4% at 15 years.9 The risk of secondary hematologic
malignancy was 2.36% at 30 years in children and 3.3%
at 18 years in adults.2,9 Secondary (or therapy-related)
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) have been reported after chemotherapy
with alkylating agents and/or topoisomerase inhibitors for
the treatment of Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, ovarian carcinoma, or testicular carcinoma.10-13
The hyper-CVAD regimen (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate and
cytarabine followed by maintenance therapy with mercaptopurine, methotrexate, vincristine, and prednisone) is an
effective frontline therapy for adults with de novo ALL,
with a median survival of 32 months and a 5-year survival
rate of 38%.14 As the survival rates for adult patients with
ALL treated with various therapeutic regimens improve,
we may encounter long-term consequences of therapy.
One study of 125 patients treated with the hyper-CVAD
regimen reported 2 patients (3.2%) who developed
MDS/AML at 4 months, 21 months, 24 months, and 37
months, respectively, after therapy.15 In another report of
1494 adult patients with ALL treated with daunorubicin,
102

rubidazone, idarubicin, vincristine, mitoxantrone,
cytarabine, L-asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and doxorubicin, 23 patients (1.5%) developed
secondary neoplasms, 6 patients had AML, and 3 had
MDS.9 In these patients, AML and MDS developed at
a median of 1.3 and 2.5 years, respectively, after diagnosis of ALL.
We analyzed the medical records of adult patients
with ALL who were treated with the hyper-CVAD regimen at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center (UTMDACC) to determine the incidence of secondary myeloid malignancies (AML/MDS) and to discern the characteristics of these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Adult patients with ALL, treated at the UTMDACC
from 1992 to 2007 with the hyper-CVAD regimen or its
variants and who were enrolled in clinical trials were
included in this analysis. The studies were approved by
the institutional review board, and all patients signed
informed consent according to institutional guidelines.
The eligibility criteria, treatment, and follow-up methods
have been described earlier.14 Patients were regularly
observed during their initial treatment and subsequent
remission.

Evaluation of Patients and Statistical
Methods
Patients were evaluated for response to treatment and for
the development of secondary myeloid neoplasms. The
duration of complete remission (CR) was calculated from
the time of achieving CR until there was evidence of leukemia recurrence (eg, 10% of lymphoblasts in the bone
marrow, or central nervous system or extramedullary

disease recurrence). Time to the development of AML/
MDS was noted from the time of ALL diagnosis. Survival
after the therapy-related AML/MDS was calculated from
the time of diagnosis of the AML/MDS to death from any
cause or until last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to determine survival.

RESULTS
We identified 641 adult patients with ALL who had
undergone treatment with the hyper-CVAD-based regimens. The median age of the patients was 40 years (range,
15-92 years). Of these, 16 (2.49%) patients developed
therapy-related AML/MDS; 1 other patient developed a
squamous cell cancer of the skin. These were the only
other secondary malignancies observed in the entire
cohort of patients. Among the patients with secondary
AML/MDS, male and female distribution was equal. The
different subtypes of ALL diagnosed in these patients were
pre-B ALL in 10 patients, mature-B ALL in 2 patients,
and T-cell ALL in 4 patients. The median follow-up of
the patients from the time of ALL diagnosis was 41.75
months (range, 21-90.5 months). The characteristics of
these patients at ALL diagnosis are shown in Table 1. The
treatment of ALL was varied and included hyper-CVADbased regimens as shown in Table 2. The response to the
treatment is also reported in Table 2. As depicted, all 16
patients achieved CR with the hyper-CVAD treatment.
The cumulative doses of the chemotherapy drugs administered are listed in Table 3.

The patients had been followed for a median of 30.2
months (range, 10.5-73.5 months) after achieving CR
until the development of AML/MDS. Six patients of 16
(37%) developed AML, and 10 (63%) patients developed
MDS. The characteristics of patients at the time of identification of AML/MDS are shown in Table 4. None of
these 16 patients underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and only 2 had received radiotherapy as part
of their therapy for ALL; both developed MDS. AML/
MDS was identified at a median of 32 months (range, 1174 months) after ALL diagnosis. The time to development of AML appeared to be longer, with a median of
35.5 months (range, 13-74 months) when compared with
the time to the development of MDS (median, 31
months; range, 11-42 months), but the difference was not
statistically significant (P ¼ .38). The cytogenetic abnormalities at the time of detection of AML/MDS are shown
in Table 4.
After the diagnosis of AML/MDS, the patients were
treated with a variety of regimens that included the combination of cytarabine with an anthracycline in 11 of 16
(69%) patients, arsenic trioxide in 1 (6%) patient, clofarabine in 1 (6%) patient, and decitabine in 2 (12%)
patients. The response to treatment is shown in Table 5.
Only 3 patients (1 [6%] with AML and 2 [12%]) with
MDS achieved a CR. Three (19%) patients with AML
and 3 (19%) with MDS achieved a partial remission,
whereas 2 (12%) patients with AML and 4 (25%) patients
with MDS had no response. One patient with MDS had
not been treated at the time of last follow-up, 1 month
after the diagnosis.

DISCUSSION
Therapy-related (secondary) cancers, particularly myeloid
neoplasms (AML/MDS), have been well described after
successful treatment of pediatric ALL, but to our knowledge are not commonly reported in the adult population.2-9 Secondary AML/MDS have been described after
alkylating agents (with 5, 7 karyotype, 5 to 7 years after therapy) and after topoisomerase inhibitors (with
11q23 and t[4;11] karyotype) 2 to 3 years after therapy.10-13 Several factors, including genetic predisposition,
the biologic characteristics of the primary cancer, and type
of chemotherapy, may affect the development of secondary cancer.

AML and MDS developed at a median of 16 months
and 30 months, respectively, after the diagnosis of ALL;
the median overall survival for all patients was 5.7
months. Their cohort of patients had an age range of 15
to 60 years (median, 33 years). In the current study, the
patients’ ages ranged from15 to 92 years (median, 40
years), and secondary AML and MDS developed at a
median of 35.5 months and 31 months, respectively, after the diagnosis and treatment of ALL. This difference
in time to the development of AML and MDS was not
found to be statistically significant (P ¼ .07). The
higher incidence of AML/MDS in our patients (2.49%
vs 0.6% in report by Tavernier et al9) could be because
of the older patient population or higher cumulative
dose of cyclophosphamide in the hyper-CVAD regimen, or a combination of both. Gill et al reported on 4
patients with ALL who subsequently developed AML/
MDS at 4 months, 21 months, 24 months, and 37
months, respectively, after therapy.15

We have found a relatively low incidence of therapyrelated AML/MDS in adult patients with ALL. Our
patients had been followed for a median of 32 months
(range, 11-74 months) after the diagnosis of ALL before
they developed AML or MDS. With the currently available regimens, survival for adult patients with ALL is limited (approximately 40% at 3 years). Therefore, a
significant number of patients do not survive long enough
to allow a secondary cancer to develop, and the risk of a
second malignancy in adult ALL is likely to be underestimated. With continued improvement in the outcomes of
patients with ALL, we may well encounter a higher incidence of therapy-related AML/MDS.
We conclude that secondary AML and MDS occur
infrequently (2.49%) in adult patients with de novo ALL
who are treated with the hyper-CVAD regimens, and
response to their treatment is poor. Because of the small
number of patients in the current study, we were unable
to identify any specific risk factors that might predispose
to the development of secondary leukemia. Furthermore,
no specific cytogenetic abnormalities occurred more frequently than expected. It is interesting to note that the
median age of our patients with therapy-related AML/
MDS at ALL diagnosis was 53 years (range, 23-66 years).
This was significantly older than the median age of 40
years (range, 15-92 years) for the entire population (P <
.0001). We can hypothesize that the bone marrow stem
105

Original Article

cells of older patients are more susceptible to the DNAdamaging effects of the cytotoxic regimens used. Although
an underlying genomic instability may contribute to the
risk of the development of secondary AML and MDS, it is
likely that the more significant culprit is the intensive
cytotoxic regimens used to treat patients with ALL. In the
future, a risk-adapted approach, in which the intensity of
chemotherapy may be adjusted to the disease characteristics and the presence or absence of minimal residual leukemia, may allow for a reduction in exposure to the
potentially causative cytotoxic agents. Furthermore, the
development of rationally designed and potent target-specific agents such as the second-generation tyrosine kinase
inhibitors may allow for the design of less intensive regimens with similar efficacy in specific subsets of adult
patients with ALL.
