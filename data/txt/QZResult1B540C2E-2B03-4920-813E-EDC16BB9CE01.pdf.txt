Abstract
Impairment of double-stranded DNA break (DSB) repair is essential to many cancers. However, although
mutations in DSB repair proteins are common in hereditary cancers, mechanisms of impaired DSB repair in
sporadic cancers remain incompletely understood. Here, we describe the ﬁrst role for a long noncoding RNA
(lncRNA) in DSB repair in prostate cancer. We identify PCAT-1, a prostate cancer outlier lncRNA, which regulates
cell response to genotoxic stress. PCAT-1 expression produces a functional deﬁciency in homologous recombination through its repression of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor, which, in turn, imparts a high sensitivity to smallmolecule inhibitors of PARP1. These effects reﬂected a posttranscriptional repression of the BRCA2 30 UTR by
PCAT-1. Our observations thus offer a novel mechanism of "BRCAness" in sporadic cancers. Cancer Res; 74(6);

Introduction
The uncontrolled accumulation of double-stranded DNA
breaks (DSB) represents a putative Achilles heel for cancer
cells, because these lesions are toxic and their repair
requires religation of disrupted genetic material (1–3).
Several mechanisms, such as nonhomologous end joining
(NHEJ), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and
homologous recombination (HR), contribute to DSB repair
and are employed variously during the cell cycle depending

on whether a speciﬁc DSB harbors either large, small, or
no stretches (NHEJ, MMEJ, and HR, respectively) of complementary DNA sequences on the two fragments of broken
DNA (4). In particular, the lethality of excess DSBs has
been exploited for the therapeutic treatment of hereditary
breast and ovarian cancers harboring BRCA1/2 mutations,
which leads to defective HR and increased DSBs (5). These
cancers exhibit synthetic lethality when treated with smallmolecule inhibitors of the PARP1 DNA repair enzyme,
whose inhibition prevents a second method of DNA repair
and leads to gross collapse of cellular DNA maintenance
(6–8).
Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have emerged
as new layer of cell biology (9), contributing to diverse
biologic processes. In cancer, aberrant expression of
lncRNAs is associated with cancer progression (9, 10), and
overexpression of oncogenic lncRNAs can promote tumor
cell proliferation and metastasis through transcriptional
regulation of target genes (11–13). Recent studies have also
identiﬁed lncRNAs induced by genotoxic stress as well as
involved in the repair of DNA damage (14, 15); however, the
role of lncRNAs in the regulation of DSB repair remains
unclear.
Here, we report the characterization of PCAT-1 as a prostate
cancer lncRNA implicated in the regulation of DSB repair. We
ﬁnd that PCAT-1 represses the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene,
leading to downstream impairment of HR. Importantly, PCAT1–expressing cells exhibit a BRCA-like phenotype, resulting in
cell sensitization to PARP1 inhibitors. In human prostate
cancer tissues, high PCAT-1 expression predicts for low BRCA2
expression, supporting our observations in model systems. To
our knowledge, this report is the ﬁrst to demonstrate a role for

lncRNAs in the regulation of DSBs in prostate cancer and
suggests a new mechanistic basis for impaired HR in this
disease.

Materials and Methods
For full details on methodology, please refer to the Supplementary Information for a complete Materials and Methods
section.
Patient samples
For the University of Michigan patient samples, prostate
tissues were obtained from the radical prostatectomy series
and Rapid Autopsy Program at the University of Michigan
tissue core. These programs are part of the University of
Michigan Prostate Cancer Specialized Program of Research
Excellence (SPORE). All tissue samples were collected with
informed consent under an Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approved protocol at the University of Michigan
[SPORE in Prostate Cancer (Tissue/Serum/Urine) Bank IRB
# 1994-0481]. For the Weill Cornell Medical College patient
samples, prostate tissues were collected as part of an IRBapproved protocol at Weill Cornell Medical College (New
York, NY).
Cell lines
All cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell lines were maintained using
standard media and conditions. Du145-derived cell lines
were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 cell culture
incubator. RWPE-derived cell lines were maintained in
keratinocyte serum-free (Invitrogen) supplemented with
bovine pituitary extract, EGF, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a 5% CO2 cell culture incubator. LNCAP-derived and
PC3-derived cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin in a 5% CO2 cell culture incubator.
PC3 cells containing the GFP HR assay construct were
generated as described previously (16, 17).
PCAT-1 or control-expressing cell lines were generated by
cloning PCAT-1 or control LacZ into the pLenti6 vector
(Invitrogen). After conﬁrmation of the insert sequence,
lentiviruses were generated at the University of Michigan
Vector Core and transfected into RWPE or Du145 cells.
Stably transfected cells were selected using blasticidin
(Invitrogen).
For LNCAP cells with stable knockdown of PCAT-1, cells
were seeded at 50%–60% conﬂuency, incubated overnight, and
transfected with PCAT-1 or nontargeting short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) lentiviral constructs for 48 hours. GFPþ cells were
drug-selected using 1 mg/mL puromycin. PCAT-1 shRNAs were
custom generated by Systems Biosciences using the following
sequences: shRNA 1 GCAGAAACACCAAUGGAUAUU; shRNA 2
AUACAUAAGACCAUGGAAAU.
To ensure cell identity, all cell lines were used for less than
6 months after resuscitation and conﬁrmed by genotyping

after resuscitation. DNA samples were diluted to 0.10 ng/mL
and ten genotyping loci (D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179,
D13S317, D18S51, D21S11, FGA, vWA, and the Amelogenin
locus) were analyzed by the University of Michigan DNA
Sequencing Core using the Proﬁler Plus PCR Ampliﬁcation
Kit (Applied Biosystems).
Cell line assays
LNCaP, Du145, PC3, and RWPE cell lines were obtained
from the ATCC and maintained in standard conditions.
Stable overexpression and knockdown cell lines were generated with lentiviral constructs with blasticidin or puromycin selection as appropriate. RNA isolation and cDNA
synthesis were performed according to standard protocols.
Quantitative PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green
Mastermix on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Real-Time
PCR system. Chemosensitivity assays were performed on
5,000 cells plated per well in 96-well plates and treated with
a single dose of olaparib or ABT-888 as indicated for 72
hours. WST assays (Roche) were performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Immunoﬂuorescence experiments were performed with 1  105 cells in 12-well plates
according to standard protocols; RAD51 and g-H2AX staining was performed 6 hours or 24 hours after treatment,
respectively.
Luciferase assays
The indicated cell lines were transfected with full-length
BRCA2 luciferase constructs as well as pRL-TK vector as
internal control for luciferase activity. After 2 days of incubation, the cells were lysed and luciferase assays conducted using
the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Each experiment
was performed in quadruplicate.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis
buffer (Sigma) and brieﬂy sonicated for homogenization.
Aliquots of each protein extract were boiled in sample
buffer, size fractionated by SDS-PAGE at 4 C, and transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was then incubated at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours in blocking buffer [Tris-buffered saline,
0.1% Tween (TBS-T), 5% nonfat dry milk] and incubated at
4 C with the appropriate antibody. Following incubation,
the blot was washed 4 times with TBS-T and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.
The blot was then washed 4 times with TBS-T and twice
with TBS and the signals visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system as described by the manufacturer (GE
Healthcare).
The following antibodies were used for immunoblot
analysis: BRCA2 (EMD, OP95), BRCA1 (Cell Signaling Technology, #9025S), XRCC1 (Abcam, ab1838), XRCC3 (Abcam,
ab97390), XRCC4 (GeneTex, GTX83406), Ku70 (BD Biosciences, #611892), Ku80 (Cell Signaling Technology,
#2180S), g-H2AX (Cell Signaling Technology, #9718) and
b-actin (Sigma, A5441).

PCAT-1 Impairs Homologous Recombination

For immunoblot densitometry, the densitometric scan of
the immunoblots was performed using ImageJ. Three replicate
experiments were quantiﬁed for the ﬁnal analysis.
Xenograft assays
Xenograft experiments were performed according to University of Michigan-approved protocols and conform to their
relevant regulatory standards. Five-week-old male severe
combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice (CB.17. SCID) were
purchased from Charles River, Inc. (Charles River Laboratory). A total of 1  106 Du145-control or Du145-PCAT-1
stable cells were resuspended in 100 mL of saline with 50%
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and were implanted subcutaneously into the left and right ﬂank regions of the mice.
Mice were anesthetized using a cocktail of xylazine (80–
120 mg/kg, i.p.) and ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for chemical
restraint before tumor implantation. All tumors were staged
for 2 weeks before starting the drug treatment. At the
beginning of the third week, mice with tumors (10
tumors/treatment group, average size 150–200 mm3) were
treated with olaparib (100 mg/kg, i.p. twice daily ﬁve times/
week) or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
control. Growth in tumor volume was recorded weekly by
using digital calipers.
I-SceI HR assay
We followed previously described protocols (16). Brieﬂy,
PC-3 cells with a single copy of DR-GFP were transfected
with empty vector control or PCAT-1. PCAT-1–transfected
cells were infected with adenovirus-encoded I-SceI (adeno-ISceI) at an MOI of 1,000. Cells were harvested 3 days after
infection and subjected to ﬂow cytometry analysis for the
GFPþ cell population.
Statistical analyses
All data are presented as means  SD or SEM, as indicated. All experimental assays were performed in duplicate
or triplicate. Statistical analyses shown in ﬁgures represent
Fisher exact tests or Student t tests, as indicated.

Results
PCAT-1 regulates BRCA2 levels and HR
We previously reported the systematic nomination of
lncRNAs associated with prostate cancer, termed Prostate
Cancer Associated Transcripts (PCAT ref. 10). Among these,
we noted that PCAT-1 expression was a prostate cancer
outlier associated with low levels of BRCA2. We therefore
hypothesized that PCAT-1 mediated the repression of
BRCA2, and thus PCAT-1 may be implicated in the dysregulation of HR upon genotoxic stress. To pursue this hypothesis, we generated a panel of three in vitro cell culture model
systems: PCAT-1 overexpression in Du145 prostate cancer
cells (which lack endogenous expression of this lncRNA),
PCAT-1 overexpression in RWPE benign prostate cells
(which lack endogenous expression of this lncRNA), and
stable knockdown of PCAT-1 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells
(which harbor high endogenous levels of PCAT-1 expression;
Fig. 1A, left).

www.aacrjournals.org

Western blot analysis of these three isogenic models uniformly revealed strong downregulation of BRCA2 protein levels
in RWPE and Du145 prostate cells and upregulation of BRCA2
in LNCaP sh-PCAT-1 cells (Fig. 1A, right). To ensure that these
observations were not restricted to cell line-based studies, we
further conﬁrmed an inverse relationship between PCAT-1 and
BRCA2 in two independent cohorts of human prostate cancer
samples. Using 58 prostate cancer tissues and 20 prostate
cancer xenografts derived from human specimens, we found
that increasing PCAT-1 expression correlated with decreased
BRCA2 expression (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Together, these data suggest that PCAT-1 expression antagonizes BRCA2 expression.
Importantly, BRCA2 inactivation impairs HR of DSBs and
serves as a predictive biomarker for response to treatment
with inhibitors of the PARP1 DNA repair enzyme through
synthetic lethality that results from joint inactivation of two
DNA repair pathways (HR via BRCA2 inactivation, and base
excision repair via PARP1 inhibition). Accordingly, treatment of our isogenic cell lines with either a PARP1 inhibitor
(olaparib or ABT-888) or radiation resulted in modulation of
RAD51 foci formation, which is a component of the HR
pathway and a marker for engagement of the HR machinery
(18). Speciﬁcally, PCAT-1 overexpression decreased RAD51
foci formation after therapy and PCAT-1 knockdown
increased RAD51 foci formation after therapy in prostate
cells (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1B–S1D). We further
used a well-characterized HR assay, in which cells employ
HR to recombine an I-SceI-cut plasmid to produce GFP
signaling (16), to evaluate the function of PCAT-1 on HR
directly. We found that transient overexpression of PCAT-1
in PC3 prostate cancer cells resulted in a signiﬁcant inhibition of GFP signaling following I-SceI–induced HR in
addition to decreased RAD51 foci (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2D). Of note, PCAT-1 expression does not
show substantial change following induction of DNA damage via radiation (Supplementary Fig. S2E).
PCAT-1 expression impairs DNA damage repair
Because PCAT-1 impairs HR, genotoxic stress of PCAT-1–
expressing cells should lead to an accumulation of DSBs, which
can be visualized using g-H2AX foci, a marker of DSBs that have
not been repaired (4). To test this, we treated our isogenic
Du145 and LNCaP cell line models with olaparib, ABT-888, or
radiation. As predicted, PCAT-1 overexpression in Du145 led to
an increase in g-H2AX foci under stress conditions (Fig. 2A and
B), indicating that PCAT-1 impairs DSB repair in these cells.
Similarly, LNCaP cells with PCAT-1 knockdown displayed
decreased levels of g-H2AX foci (Fig. 2A and B). Immunoblot
analysis of g-H2AX protein abundance in these cells following
genotoxic stress conﬁrmed a downregulation of g-H2AX with
knockdown of PCAT-1 and upregulation of g-H2AX with overexpression of PCAT-1 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Finally, we also evaluated the ability for our isogenic cell
lines to sustain growth in clonogenic survival assays, a goldstandard assay for cell viability following genotoxic stress,
after treatment of cells with PARP1 inhibition or radiation.
We found that PCAT-1 expression led to decreased cell

survival in Du145 and RWPE cells, whereas PCAT-1 knockdown increased LNCaP cell survival, in these assays (Supplementary Fig. S4). To exclude a regulatory relationship
between PCAT-1 and other major actors in DNA damage, we
performed analysis of XRCC1 (base excision repair pathway),
XRCC3 (HR), XRCC4 (NHEJ), Ku70 (NHEJ), Ku80 (NHEJ), and
BRCA1 (multiple pathways) in our in vitro models, which
showed no change in protein abundance upon modulation
of PCAT-1 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Together, these data
indicate that PCAT-1 expression may impart cell sensitivity
to genotoxic stress by decreasing the HR response through
downregulation of BRCA2.
PCAT-1 expression leads to increased cell death
following genotoxic stress
Because PCAT-1–expressing cells exhibit reduced HR
efﬁciency when challenged, we investigated whether PARP1

1654

Cancer Res; 74(6) March 15, 2014

inhibition selectively killed PCAT-1–expressing cells. Following treatment with two PARP1 inhibitors (olaparib
or ABT-888), we observed that knockdown of PCAT-1 in
LNCaP cells prevented cell death, whereas overexpression
of PCAT-1 in Du145 and RWPE prostate cells increased
cell death in response to PARP inhibition (Fig. 3A, left
and Supplementary Fig. S5B–S5D). This change in cell
sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitors was striking, with a ﬁve-fold
change in the IC50 for LNCaP and Du145 cells (Fig. 3A, right
and Supplementary Fig. S6). Similar results were observed
in RWPE cells overexpressing PCAT-1 (Supplementary
Fig. S7).
To ensure that these effects were dependent on BRCA2, we
undertook rescue experiments by performing knockdown of
BRCA2 in LNCaP shPCAT-1 cells (which have increased levels of
BRCA2). These experiments demonstrated a corresponding
increase in the sensitivity of these cells to PARP1 inhibition in a

BRCA2 knockdown (Fig. 3B). We further observed reduced
RAD51 foci after treatment following BRCA2 knockdown in
LNCaP shPCAT-1 cells as well (Supplementary Fig. S8). To
exclude a role for altered cell-cycle distributions in these
phenotypes, we performed ﬂow cytometry, which demonstrated no change in cell cycle in our model systems (Supplementary Fig. S9).
PCAT-1 expression leads to decreased in vivo tumor
growth following PARP inhibition
To evaluate the contribution of PCAT-1 to PARP inhibitor
response in vivo, we generated xenografts of Du145 cells
expressing either empty vector control or PCAT-1. We
observed that Du145-PCAT-1 cells grew signiﬁcantly more

rapidly in SCID mice, consistent with our previous ﬁndings
that PCAT-1 accelerates prostate cell proliferation in vitro
(Fig. 3C; ref. 10). Moreover, Du145-PCAT-1 xenografts
showed marked susceptibility and tumor regression following intraperitoneal administration of olaparib, whereas
Du145-control cells showed only a subtle change in growth
while the drug was administered, indicating that the background effect of olaparib therapy, possibly due to its effects
on other members of the PARP family (19), is small (Fig. 3C).
Mice in all groups of treatment maintained their body
weights and showed no evidence of weight loss (Supplementary Fig. S10A).
Importantly, Du145 xenografts retained both PCAT-1
expression and BRCA2 repression (Fig. 3D). To investigate
PCAT-1 signaling under control-treated (DMSO) and

PCAT-1 Impairs Homologous Recombination

olaparib-treated conditions, we also observed in vivo upregulation of PCAT-1–induced target genes (TOP2A, E2F8, BIRC5, and
KIF15; Supplementary Fig. S10B) deﬁned by previous microarray proﬁling of LNCaP cells with PCAT-1 siRNAs and conﬁrmed in RWPE-PCAT-1–overexpressing cells (Supplementary
Fig. S10C; ref. 10). These data suggest that PCAT-1 is mechanistically linked to increased prostate cell sensitivity to
PARP1 inhibitors via its repression of BRCA2 both in vitro
and in vivo.
PCAT-1 does not operate via traditional lncRNAmediated mechanisms
Although many lncRNAs are noted to regulate gene
transcription through epigenetic mechanisms (11, 13, 20),
we did not observe evidence for this possibility with PCAT-1.
Although PCAT-1 regulated BRCA2 mRNA in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S11A), treatment of RWPE-LacZ and RWPEPCAT-1 cells with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-aza), the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA, or
both, did not reveal enhanced epigenetic regulation of
BRCA2 mRNA in PCAT-1–expressing cells (Supplementary
Fig. S11B), although there was a baseline regulation of
BRCA2 in both cell lines when 5-aza and TSA were combined. Furthermore, bisulﬁte sequencing of the BRCA2
promoter in our isogenic LNCaP and RWPE model systems
demonstrated minimal CpG island methylation in all cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S11C). These results suggest
that epigenetic repression of BRCA2 is not the primary
mechanism of PCAT-1. Moreover, lncRNAs containing Alu
elements in their transcript sequence may utilize these
repetitive sequences to regulate target gene mRNAs via
STAU1-dependent degradation (21). Although PCAT-1 harbors an Alu element from bps 1103–1402, knockdown
of STAU1 in LNCaP or VCaP cells, which endogenously
harbor PCAT-1, did not alter BRCA2 levels (Supplementary
Fig. S11D).
PCAT-1 regulates BRCA2 post-transcriptionally
To determine whether PCAT-1 may function in a manner
more analogous to microRNAs, which regulate mRNA levels
post-transcriptionally (22), we generated a luciferase construct of the BRCA2 30 UTR, which is 902 bp in length (Fig.
4A). Surprisingly, we found that RWPE-PCAT-1 cells, but not
control RWPE-LacZ cells, were able to directly repress the
activity of the wild-type BRCA2 30 UTR construct (Fig. 4A).
Supporting these data, we found that PCAT-1 was localized
to the cell cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S12A) and overexpression of PCAT-1 in Du145 cells signiﬁcantly reduced the
stability of endogenous BRCA2 mRNA, consistent with a
posttranscriptional mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S12B
and S12C).
To map a region of PCAT-1 required for repression of the
BRCA2 30 UTR, we additionally generated a series of PCAT-1
deletion constructs and overexpressed these in RWPE cells
(Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S13A). We generated these
constructs to establish whether the 30 end of PCAT-1, which
contains portions of ancestral transposase and Alu repeat
elements (Fig. 4B; ref. 10), or the 50 end of PCAT-1, which

www.aacrjournals.org

consists of nonrepetitive DNA sequences, was required for
BRCA2 repression. We observed that the 50 end of PCAT-1
was sufﬁcient to downregulate the BRCA2 30 UTR luciferase
signal as well as endogenous BRCA2 transcript levels (Fig. 4B
and C), and for this regulation, the ﬁrst 250 bp of the PCAT-1
gene were required. In contrast, the 30 end of PCAT-1 was
expendable. Importantly, the 50 end of PCAT-1 was similarly
sufﬁcient to sensitize RWPE cells to olaparib treatment in
vitro (Fig. 4D). To rule out the possibility that RNA instability
was responsible for the inactivity of the PCAT-1 constructs,
we performed RNA stability assays, which demonstrated
equivalent rates of RNA decay between full-length PCAT-1
and the inactive PCAT-1 deletion constructs in RWPE cells
(Supplementary Fig. S13B). Together, these results indicate
that PCAT-1 overexpression is able to directly repress the
activity of the BRCA2 30 UTR and that this repression
required the 50 end of PCAT-1.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of an lncRNA
being involved in the DSB repair process in prostate cancer
(Supplementary Fig. S14). These data are supported by a
striking inverse correlation between PCAT-1 and BRCA2
expression in human prostate cancer samples. Our results
expand the potential roles for lncRNAs in cancer biology and
contrast strikingly with previous reports that lncRNAs operate epigenetically through chromatin-modifying complexes
(23, 24). Indeed, epigenetic regulation likely represents only
one of numerous mechanisms for lncRNA function (12, 21,
25, 26). Supporting this notion, we do not observe compelling evidence that PCAT-1 functions in an epigenetic manner, but rather it may exhibit posttranscriptional regulation
of its target genes.
Importantly, PCAT-1 is also predominantly cytoplasmic,
and thus our work describes the ﬁrst cytoplasmic prostate
lncRNA to be associated with therapeutic response. Cytoplasmic lncRNAs are also less well explored than their
nuclear counterparts, and our work sheds light onto the
complex mechanistic regulation of cellular processes via
cytoplasmic lncRNAs. However, PCAT-1 does exhibit a
smaller degree of nuclear expression (see Supplementary
Fig. S12A), which may account for our previous observation
that PCAT-1 may associate with the nuclear Polycomb
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Although our data directly
support a role for PCAT-1 in the posttranscriptional regulation of BRCA2, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of
additional regulation of BRCA2 at the transcriptional level
at this time.
In addition, while the mechanism underlying PCAT-1 function remains incompletely understood, we were intrigued that
the 50 portion of the PCAT-1 RNA, which is comprised of fully
unique sequences, was critical for its regulation of BRCA2
mRNA whereas the embedded Alu element was not. Although
we did not identify a speciﬁc microRNA with high-conﬁdence
7-mer complementary base pair matching to both this region
of PCAT-1 and BRCA2 (data not shown), we speculate that
alternative mechanisms of miRNA-like mismatch base pairing

may contribute to PCAT-1-mediated regulation in a manner
similar to the recently described networks of competing
endogenous RNAs (27).
Together, our data suggest that lncRNAs may have a more
widespread role in mammalian genome maintenance and
DNA repair than previously appreciated. In support of this, a
role for small RNAs in human DNA damage repair in human
cells has been recently reported and shown to be dependent
upon the microRNA biogenesis machinery (28). Of note,
Adamson and colleagues nominated the RNA-binding protein RBMX as a novel component of the HR pathway (16),
suggesting that RNA–protein interactions may be integral to
this process.
This work sheds insight onto potential mechanisms of
impaired DSB repair in cancers lacking an inactivating
mutation in canonical DSB repair proteins. Thus, our studies
have uncovered a novel mechanism of "BRCAness"—the
clinical observation that many cancers lacking BRCA1/
BRCA2 mutations exhibit the clinical features of impaired
DSB repair (2, 29, 30). We hypothesize that other cancers

1658

Cancer Res; 74(6) March 15, 2014

with a BRCA-like phenotype may harbor lncRNAs involved in
the regulation and execution of proper HR and other forms
of DSB repair. Finally, future clinical trials examining the
efﬁcacy of PARP1 inhibitors in prostate cancer will provide
critical information as to whether PCAT-1 may serve as a
predictive biomarker for patient response to PARP1 inhibitor therapy.
