Abstract
Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play a critical role in the
manifestation of cancer cell properties, and respective
signaling mechanisms have been studied extensively on
immortalized tumor cells. To characterize and analyze
commonly used cancer cell lines with regard to variations in
the primary structure of all expressed PTKs, we conducted a
cDNA-based sequence analysis of the entire tyrosine kinase
transcriptome of 254 established tumor cell lines. The profiles
of cell line intrinsic PTK transcript alterations and the
evaluation of 155 identified polymorphisms and 234 somatic
mutations are made available in a database designated
‘‘Tykiva’’ (tyrosine ki nome variant). Tissue distribution
analysis and/or the localization within defined protein
domains indicate functional relevance of several genetic
alterations. The cysteine replacement of the highly conserved
Y367 residue in fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 or the
Q26X nonsense mutation in the tumor-suppressor kinase CSK
are examples, and may contribute to cell line–specific
signaling characteristics and tumor progression. Moreover,
known variants, such as epidermal growth factor receptor
G719S, that were shown to mediate anticancer drug sensitivity
could be detected in other than the previously reported tumor
types. Our data therefore provide extensive system information for the design and interpretation of cell line–based
cancer research, and may stimulate further investigations into
broader clinical applications of current cancer therapeutics.

Introduction
For decades, research on established cancer cell lines has been
the basis of pioneering discoveries in diverse areas of modern
biology. Especially the fields of tumor biology and signal
transduction research critically depended on studies of tumorderived cell lines. Also, the development of currently used cancer

therapeutics, including protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) targeting
agents, was made possible through the use of cancer cells in
culture.
Because of the established relevance of PTKs for cancer
initiation and progression, extensive screens for genomic sequence
changes of the cancer kinome have been undertaken and yielded a
diversity of sporadic alterations (1–8). Besides sporadic mutations
that accumulate in the developing tumor due to cancer genome
instability, DNA sequence polymorphisms have been linked to
cancer aggressiveness and susceptibility (9). The fibroblast growth
factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) G388R single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP), for instance, was found to be associated with increased cell
motility in vitro as well as lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor
stage, and reduced survival of breast cancer patients (10).
Moreover, this SNP was shown to mediate resistance to adjuvant
therapy in primary breast cancer, and its clinical relevance was also
shown for soft tissue sarcoma, and head and neck, colon, and
prostate cancers (11). Recent genome-wide association studies to
identify SNPs connected with cancer susceptibility reflect the
increasing recognition of polymorphisms as cancer-relevant
parameters (12–14).
Through cDNA-based tyrosine kinase transcriptome (TKT)
sequence evaluation, we performed a comprehensive characterization and analysis of widely used cancer cell lines with regard to
variations in the primary structure of all expressed tyrosine
kinases. For 254 established tumor cell lines of 19 tissue origins, we
determined the profiles of both somatic mutations and germ line
polymorphisms detectable in the transcripts of 90 PTK genes (15).
The localization within the respective protein sequence, sequence
comparisons with related genes, or the tissue distribution indicated
potential functional relevance for individual genetic alterations
that may define the cell line specific signaling characteristics and/
or properties related to oncogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Samples. The panel of 254 cancer and 7 nontumorigenic cell lines was
obtained from various sources (Supplementary Table S1). Poly(A)+ RNAs
from diverse organs of 15 different cancer-free individuals were purchased
from Ambion (Supplementary Table S1); genomic DNA derived from blood
of 90 noncancer donors was from Coriell Institute for Medical Research.
Samples of 55 primary invasive breast carcinomas were obtained from H.
Hoefler and S. Iacobelli. Biopsies of 55 kidney tumors and 55 prostate cancer
specimens were provided by S. Peter (Supplementary Table S2).
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis. Total RNA was extracted
from exponentially growing cells using guanidinium thiocyanate (16).

Sequence Variations in Cancer Cell PTK Transcriptome
Subsequently, mRNA was isolated via oligo(dT) cellulose and reverse
transcribed using oligo(dT) primers (17).
Genes, PCR, and sequencing. With purified cDNAs prepared from 261
cell lines and 15 control tissues as templates, overlapping fragments
covering the entire coding region of all 58 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
and 32 cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase genes (15) were PCR amplified in at least
two independent experiments. For each fragment, PCR conditions were
specifically optimized using pooled cDNAs in a first step, and cDNAs from
six individual cell lines in a second step. Thereby, the efficiencies of three
proofreading polymerases (Novagen, Roche, Invitrogen) in combination
with or without additives (DMSO, betaine, TMA oxalate), various primer
pairs and different annealing temperatures were compared, and best
parameters applied to the full panel of samples.
PCR products for all genes except IRR, MUSK, FGR , and SRMS, for which
we obtained no amplicons, were subjected to direct sequencing of both
forward and reverse strands. For selected alterations, homologous fragments from cDNAs of 165 primary tumors were PCR amplified using the
same primer pairs. To further verify potential germ line origin of given
variants, additional primers were designed to PCR amplify the respective
region from genomic DNA of 90 blood samples from healthy donors.
Primers for amplification and sequencing of cDNA (Supplementary
Table S3) and genomic DNA (Supplementary Table S4) were designed using
the Primer3 program8 and refer to National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI)9 reference sequence files with accession numbers
provided in Supplementary Table S5.
Data analysis. Sequence differences to the NCBI9 reference sequence
were identified via manual inspection of aligned electropherograms
assisted by the Mutation Surveyor software package. In addition to
nonsynonymous genetic alterations, we detected numerous silent sequence
variations that are not presented and further analyzed here. It is
noteworthy that 63 sequence differences to the NCBI9 database occurred
in all cDNA samples we analyzed and represent either other isoforms or
variants that might actually be wild-type rather than genetic alterations
(Supplementary Table S6).

Results and Discussion
Characterization of PTK transcripts in 254 tumor cell lines.
To comprehensively characterize widely used tumor cell lines with
regard to nonsilent alterations in all expressed tyrosine kinase
genes, we evaluated the sequence of the entire TKT of 254
established cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). These cell
lines were derived from 19 different tissue origins (Fig. 1A), controls
included seven nontumorigenic cell lines and 15 tissues from
different organs of healthy individuals.
For each cell line and control sample, whole-cell cDNA was
prepared and used for the amplification and direct sequencing of
the complete PTK coding region. Despite the lack of normal tissue
counterparts for the established tumor cell lines, we attempted to
define the identified PTK transcript variations as somatic or germ
line sequence differences. We declared those sequence differences
as germ line polymorphisms that were either detected in our 22
controls or were previously reported as hereditary variants in the
NCBI SNP database,9 Ensemble Genome Browser,10 the UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot database,11 the SNP500Cancer database,12 or the
literature. Besides zygosity, cell line–specific variant profiles thus
indicate germ line or somatic origin of the individual TKT sequence

variations. Representative examples are displayed for the skinderived tumor cell lines A-375, BOW-G, C-32, C-8161, and Colo-16
(Fig. 1B). The characterization of all cell lines can be found in
Supplementary Table S7.
Based on these data, we determined the absolute number and
distribution of TKT-linked somatic mutations and germ line
polymorphisms within the entire tumor cell line panel. For
polymorphisms, we observed a Gaussian-like distribution with an
average of 12.3 sequence variations per cancer cell line. In contrast,
somatic mutations were unevenly distributed (Fig. 1C). No somatic
alterations were detected in the TKT of 119 cancer cell lines,
consistent with kinome mutations entirely absent in subsets of
recently screened breast cancer, lung carcinoid, and testicular
germ-cell tumor samples (1–3). In contrast, high frequencies of 9 to
14 somatic mutations in the transcribed tyrosine kinomes of
LNCaP, Jurkat, MeWo, MKN-1, HCT-15, and DLD-1 might reflect a
mutator phenotype (1). They are in agreement with sequence data
of 24 cancer genes in the NCI-60 cell line panel that also showed
HCT-15 to be one of the most frequently mutated tumor cell lines
(18). With intermediate mutation rates for the other tumor cell
lines, our data indicate an accumulation of somatic mutations in
PTK transcripts of various cancer cell lines which may contribute
to the progression characteristics of certain cancers.
In the entire panel of cancer cell lines and controls, we identified
389 nonsynonymous genetic variations within 39.85 of 72.08 MB of
PTK coding sequence that were amplifiable and represent the
detectable TKT of all samples. As alternative to the allocation to
cell line–specific variant profiles, we grouped these sequence
differences by genes and PTK subfamilies. Each variation was
thereby specified regarding the spectrum of affected cell lines as
well as the zygosity status and the presumable somatic versus germ
line origin. These data are shown for FGFR4 (Fig. 2) that will be
discussed below. The full information for all transcript variants and
PTK genes can be obtained from Supplementary Table S8.
Sequence specifications of frame shift alterations and insertions
are provided in Supplementary Table S9.
Tykiva database for cancer cell line TKT analysis. Additionally, all data on the identified PTK transcript variants are compiled
in the database designated Tykiva.13 Transcript variants can be
specifically retrieved for each of the 254 tumor cell lines, 19 tissue
origins/tumor types, or any of the 90 PTK genes. Somatic or germ
line origin is indicated, and other cell lines carrying the same
variant are referred to. In graphical gene representations, the
localization of all detected variants is displayed in the context of
the reference amino acid sequence as well as predicted protein
domain structures according to Swiss-Prot data. Optionally
projectable to the major known isoforms, these illustrations
cross-reference our data to variant information from the NCBI
SNP database,9 the Ensemble Genome Browser,10 the Swiss-Prot11
and the Genbank14 databases, the KinMutBase,15 the IDbases,16
and the literature. By that, they comprise the current knowledge
of nonsilent genetic variations in PTK genes.
The expressed PTK variants may define cell line–specific
signaling characteristics and cancer-related cell properties. In the
following sections, we therefore address tissue distribution and

the respective protein sequence. Based on these data and the
current literature, we discuss potential functional and/or clinical
relevance for some of the identified genetic variants.
Characterization of 155 PTK gene sequence polymorphisms.
According to our definition of somatic and germ line sequence
variants, 155 of the 389 identified alterations were classified as
sequence polymorphisms. They include 131 SNPs, 16 germ line
deletions, and 8 insertions. Their overall frequencies and localization in distinct protein domains are summarized in Fig. 3A and B.
Moreover, the occurrence frequency of each polymorphism in
individual tumor types or control samples was determined.
Occurrence frequency was thereby defined as the fraction of
carriers of a given sequence variant and the number of cell lines
with the same tissue origin that express the corresponding gene
regardless of its genotype (paired numbers in Fig. 3C and
Supplementary Table S10). It therefore reflects the expression

aspect of respective genes and alterations, as addressed by our
cDNA analysis.
Of the 131 missense substitutions, 100 had been reported
previously. However, only 12 of them, as well as two deletions, have
been connected with cancer thus far (Supplementary Table S10). It
is noteworthy that five of eight novel deletions involve entire exons
(Supplementary Table S10) and most likely represent splice
variants. Such variants could preferentially be detected because
of the use of cDNA as sequencing target. Moreover, other
transcription-related mechanisms such as epigenetic gene silencing
or mRNA stability are also reflected by cDNA, and genetic
alterations identified therein are thus likely to be expressed within
the cell. However, a disadvantage of our approach is that it does
not detect fusion kinase gene or amplified kinase transcripts.
To verify the in vivo relevance of the sequence variations
detected in tumor cell lines, we analyzed cDNA from 165
primary breast, kidney, and prostate cancer specimens as well as

Cancer relevance of identified polymorphisms. Some of the
identified polymorphisms have previously been associated with
nonproliferative diseases. Respective functional modulations may,
because of the pleiotropic effects of many PTKs, also be relevant for
cancer. This is exemplified by the V722I transversion in the
pseudokinase domain of Janus-activated kinase 3 that we identified
as a rare heterozygous polymorphism in the head and neck cancer
cell lines SCC-10A and SCC-10B (Fig. 3C). First reported in patients
with autosomal recessive T-B+ SCID syndrome (19), its recent
detection in an acute megakaryoblastic leukemia patient and the
capacity to transform Ba/F3 cells (20) support a potential role in
cancer. Another example is NTRK1 R780Q, which we found in the
colon, ovarian, and head and neck cancer cell lines Caco2, SK-OV-8,
and SCC-9 (Fig. 3C), respectively. This SNP affects the same arginine
residue whose replacement with proline was shown to be associated
with ‘‘congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis’’ and
abrogation of catalytic tyrosine kinase activity in vitro (21).
Assuming a similar loss-of-function for the NTRK1 Q780 isotype,
this variant may exert antiapoptotic and hence pro-oncogenic
effects, as expression of NTRK1 wild-type was associated with
induction of apoptosis and a favorable prognosis of neuroblastoma
patients (22).
Cancer relevance was also established for MET T1010I, which
represents a biomarker for MET inhibitor efficacy (23) and was
originally reported as a somatic gain-of-function mutation in small
cell lung cancer and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; ref. 24)
and malignant pleural mesotheliomas (23). Its detection in 4 of our
90 blood control DNAs (Supplementary Table S11), however,
confirmed previous hints for potential germ line occurrence (25).
Moreover, the identification of MET T1010I in the prostate
carcinoma cell line TSU-PR1 and a primary prostate tumor as
well as in the brain, breast, colon, hematopoietic, and skin cancer
cell lines IHR-32, DAL, LS-123, U-266, and Colo-829, respectively
(Fig. 3C and Supplementary Tables S10 and S11), suggests
enhanced MET signaling in these tumor cell lines and expands
the currently reported spectrum of affected tumor types.
Polymorphism frequencies in cancer cells versus normal
tissues. Differential occurrence rates of sequence polymorphisms
in particular cancer types and/or normal tissues may indicate
tumor suppressive or promoting effects. To address the potential
relevance of all polymorphism for certain tumor types, we
compared their occurrence frequencies in tissue types and control
samples (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table S10). Only some
examples are displayed in Fig. 4. For epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) R521K, a relative overrepresentation of the EGFR
K521 allele in cDNAs of normal control samples (55%), colon (52%),
and head and neck (69%) tumor cell lines was detected (Fig. 4, left).
This indicates a possible tumor suppressive activity of the EGFR
K521 isotype that apparently is not relevant to colon cancer and
head and neck cancer. An attenuated growth response to EGFR
ligands and reduced induction of the proto-oncogenes FOS, JUN,
and MYC in EGFR K521, but not EGFR R521–expressing cells (26),
and an increased risk of local recurrence after chemoradiation
treatment for rectal cancer patients with at least one EGFR R521
allele (27) support these conclusions. Similarly, a clearly differential
occurrence of TYK2 F362 allele carriers was observed in brain
(75%)–derived and hematopoietic/lymphoid system (67%)–derived
tumor cell lines compared with control tissues (31%) or other
tumor types (Fig. 4, middle). The novel polymorphism TNK
M598delinsEVRSHX was found at low frequencies in control samples (5%) and cancer cells of several tissue origins, but occurred in

Figure 4. Diverging occurrence rates of polymorphisms in different tumor
types and/or control samples. The frequency of homozygous (HO ; dark blue
column ) and heterozygous (HE ; light blue column ) carriers of EGFR R521K,
TYK2 V362F, and TNK1 M598delinsEVRSHX was determined. Only tissue
origins (for abbreviations, see legend to Fig. 3) with an expression of the
corresponding gene in at least 10 samples have been selected for this analysis.

62% of blood-derived, 55% of skin-derived, and, even more
prominent, 80% of brain-derived tumor cell lines (Fig. 4, right). In
contrast to EGFR R521K, the underrepresentation of the TYK2 F362
allele and the TNK insertion in control samples indicates a tumorpromoting function with particular relevance for leukemia,
melanoma, and glioma. It can be expected that, as for EGFR
R521K (27) or FGFR4 G388R (10), the correlation with clinical
parameters will assign therapeutic and/or predictive value to many
of such unequally distributed alleles.
Polymorphisms affecting the kinase domain. The localization
of genetic alterations within the respective protein sequence may

be indicative of structural and/or functional consequences. The
skipping of entire exons in the cytoplasmic kinases TYK2 and TXK,
TYK2 E971fsX67 and TXK Y414fsX15, for instance, results in frame
shifts and premature translation termination in the tyrosine kinase
domains, and thus most likely is associated with catalytic
inactivation. The truncated TYK2 variant that lacks 206 amino
acids of the kinase domain, including the catalytic site and the
activation loop, may also impose a dominant negative effect on cell
signals. Interestingly, Stoiber et al. (28) reported that TYK2deficient mice developed B and T lymphoid leukemia with higher
incidence and shortened latency as a result of decreased cytotoxic
capacity of TYK2 / natural killer (NK) and NKT cells and thus
impaired tumor surveillance. Because NK activity as part of the
innate immune system mediates tumor rejection in general, the
significance of TYK2 loss-of-function might not be restricted to
hematopoietic malignancies, but may also be important for other
cancer types. Consistent with this possibility, we detected TYK2
E971fsX67 in cancer cells derived from various tissues, including
breast, cervix/vulva, colon, endometrium, lung, and pancreas
(Fig. 3C), as well as 33 clinical breast, prostate, and kidney cancer
specimens. Its occurrence in the control cell line BPH-1 suggests
potential germ line origin. Hence, the TYK2 E971fsX67 splice
variant may also represent a prognostic marker for cancer patients
and support therapeutic decision making.
Overall, these examples point at the potential role of sequence
polymorphisms as genetic parameters that may contribute to a
patient-specific definition of disease predisposition, rate of
progression, or responsiveness to therapeutic agents. In conjunction with simple detectability in blood samples, this renders

polymorphisms to be highly valuable biomarkers for diagnostic
patient characterization.
Identification of 234 somatic PTK gene mutations. Of all
sequence differences, 234 were undetectable in any of the control
samples or public databases and were thus defined as somatic
mutations. However, because of the lack of cell line–specific
normal tissue controls, we cannot exclude the possibility that some
actually represent rare germ line polymorphisms. The somatic
mutations are composed of 210 missense and 2 nonsense single
nucleotide substitutions as well as 19 deletions and 3 insertions.
Although the majority (186) occurred once, 53 were found two to
five times, and 3 in 6 to 10 tumor cell lines (Fig. 5A). Among the
twice-occurring somatic mutations, 20 were detected in cell lines
originating from the same tumor donor (Supplementary Table S1).
They may be considered single mutations, thus adding up to a total
of 206 nonrecurring mutational events. As for the polymorphisms,
we present all somatic TKT alterations in the context of the
respective protein domains and tumor types, and display the ratio
of affected and expression-positive cell lines for each tissue origin
(Fig. 5B and C; Supplementary Table S12).
Consistent with SYK A353T to represent one of the two most
prevalent mutations, the tumor-suppressive tyrosine kinase SYK
turned out to be the most frequently mutated kinase within our
panel of 254 tumor cell lines. When absolute numbers of somatic
mutations were compared, SYK scored highest with mutations
detected in 11 nonrelated tumor cell lines (Supplementary Table
S13). After normalization with respect to the PTK transcription
status, SYK showed the highest mutation rate of 30.3 sporadic
alterations per 1 Mb expressed coding sequence, followed by

Somatic mutations with possible oncogenic potential.
Somatic mutations clustering in the EGFR kinase domain (EGFR
G719S, L858R, L861Q, and others) have recently been reported for
patients with gefitinib-responsive NSCLC and were shown to
enhance tyrosine kinase activity and sensitivity to gefitinib in vitro
(29–31). We found the EGFR G719S mutation to be heterozygously
expressed in the colon cancer cell line SW-48 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). This shows the existence of Iressa
sensitivity-mediating mutations in cancers other than NSCLC
and, in particular, suggests colon cancer as another potential
indication for gefitinib therapy.
Similar to EGFR L858R and gefitinib, the KIT N822K mutation
that we confirmed in the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line
KASUMI-1 (32) was reported to mediate sensitivity to Gleevec (33).
The enhanced in vitro receptor activation shown for these EGFR
and KIT mutations (30, 34) might be related to their location within
the regulatory activation loop. In this respect, the sporadic
variations FLT3 R849H, TEK A1006T, ABL G417E, ARG K450R,
and TEC W531R, which we detected homozygously or heterozygously in BM-1604, SK-MEL-2, MM-Leh, Caki-2, and Jurkat
(Fig. 5C), are particularly intriguing as they are located in the
activation loop as well. By inference, these mutations may also have
a higher probability to modulate the tyrosine kinase catalytic
activity and/or related signaling pathways within the respective
tumor cell lines.
The 18 somatic mutations we identified in intracellular
juxtamembrane domains (Supplementary Table S12) might affect
functionally important elements that mediate down-regulation of
RTK activity. The in-frame deletion MET D981_E1027del as a result
of exon 14 skipping, for instance, leads to the loss of c-Cbl E3-ligase
binding, decreased ubiquitination, and prolonged ligand-dependent cell signaling in vitro and in vivo (35). Although we confirmed
MET D981_E1027del in the NSCLC cell line NCI-H596, its
homozygous detection in breast and stomach cancer cell lines

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

MDA-MB-415 and Hs746T, respectively (Fig. 5C), provides evidence
for its occurrence in tumor types other than the reported NSCLC
(35, 36). Presuming enhanced sensitivity to anti-MET therapeutics
that MET D981_E1027del was suggested to mediate (35), our
findings extend the potential clinical relevance for this deletion.
The somatic mutations we identified within the extracellular
domain of two FGFR family members, FGFR1 P252S and FGFR4
Y367C (Figs. 5C and 6B), possibly augment receptor activation by
influencing ligand binding and receptor dimerization, respectively.
The highly conserved FGFR1 P252 residue we found to be
heterozygously exchanged with hydrophilic serine in the melanoma
cell line MeWo has previously been shown to be replaced by
threonine in lung cancer (2) and arginine in patients with Pfeiffer
syndrome (37). The crystal structure of the homologous activating
FGFR2 mutant, FGFR2 P252R, revealed the formation of three
additional hydrogen bonds with complexed fibroblast growth
factor 2 (FGF2). They were predicted to increase the receptor
affinity for its specific ligand as well as to allow binding of a
different set of ligands (38). Because the hydroxyl group of the
P252-replacing serine residue in FGFR1 also has a high potential to
form additional hydrogen bonds, the somatic FGFR1 P252S
substitution may represent a gain-of-function mutation with
analogous functional consequences as for FGFR2 P252R. This is
particularly intriguing in the context of studies demonstrating that
blockage of FGFR1 or basic fibroblast growth factor function was
associated with suppressed proliferation and survival of melanoma
cells (39).
The novel FGFR4 Y367C mutation was detected as a homozygous genotype in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453, and the
affected Y367 residue in the extracellular juxtamembrane domain is
highly conserved throughout the FGF family. Remarkably, homologous substitutions in FGFR1 (Y372C), FGFR2 (Y375C), and FGFR3
(Y373C) were shown to cause various osteogenic deficiency
syndromes (40) through the formation of intermolecular disulfide
bonds that force receptor dimerization and activation. Ligandindependent, constitutive receptor activation has been confirmed
in vitro for FGFR1 Y372C (41) and FGFR3 Y373C (42). Furthermore,

Sequence Variations in Cancer Cell PTK Transcriptome

the oncogenic potential of the FGFR3 Y373C variant has been
shown and was suggested to contribute to tumor progression of
multiple myeloma (43). Thus, it is most likely that Y367C as the
homologous FGFR4 variant also results in basal receptor activation,
which strongly indicates an important role of this mutant in
cancer.
Nonsense substitutions abrogate tumor suppressor activity.
Down-regulation of tumor-suppressive activity is expected for
the two nonsense substitutions we detected in EPHB2 and CSK
(Fig. 5C). Q722X-mediated truncation and kinase inactivation of
EPHB2 in the two prostate cancer cell lines BM-1604 and DU-145
supports mutational inactivation to be involved in progression of
prostate cancer as proposed by Huusko et al. (44). They showed
suppressed growth and colony formation of DU-145 cells upon
reconstitution with functional EPHB2. The heterozygous CSK Q26X
nonsense substitution detected in the colon cancer cell lines DLD-1
and HCT-15 is consistent with reduced protein levels of this
negative regulator of SRC family kinases that were reported for
f60% of human colon cancer cases with elevated SRC activity (45).
These data indicate a significant role of CSK nonsense mutations in
the development and/or progression of colon carcinoma and
therefore strongly suggest the inclusion of SRC kinase inhibitors in
the therapeutic regimen of this prevalent malignancy.
The examples discussed above represent only a partial extract of
our overall data. Other genetic alterations affecting less investigated PTKs such as members of the AATYK, DDR, EPH, ROR, ROS, or
FRK families, as well as tyrosine kinases that more recently
captured scientific attention such as HER3 or ACK1, have been
found (Supplementary Tables S2–S6). Their identification will
support novel functional investigations toward the understanding
of the therapeutic value of these kinases.
Low redundancy of PTK gene mutations in human tumors.
In agreement with results from previous studies (1–7, 46), our
analysis of 254 cancer cell lines and additional primary tumors
indicates that mutational patterns might be quite unique for the
majority of human tumors, and that the frequency of specific
somatic mutations in PTKs is low. Data mining of public databases
and the literature revealed that only nine of all sporadic alterations
identified in our study have been described before (Supplementary
Table S12). Among them are KIT N822K and VEGFR1 R781Q
as the only two alterations that were picked up in the currently most

comprehensive mutational kinome analysis of human cancer
samples (7). The low redundancy of somatic mutations is
furthermore reflected by the nonrecurrence that we found for 206
of the 234 mutational events within our panel of tumor cell lines.
Consistent with this picture, none of the seven somatic
representatives of our exemplary subset of nonconservative
andmore frequent alterations found in at least one breast, kidney,
or prostate cancer cell line could be detected in any of the 165
primary breast, kidney, and prostate cancer specimens (Supplementary Table S11). In fact, two genetic alterations, YES K113Q and
TYRO3 E489K, were found in blood controls and therefore must be
considered rare germ line alterations.
Despite the low redundancy of individual mutations, 70 of the
tyrosine kinase genes turned out to carry at least one somatic
mutation. Although most of our mutations require further
experimental evaluation to determine their cancer relevance and
in some cases may turn out to represent ‘‘passenger’’ rather than
‘‘driver’’ mutations, this broad incidence of sporadic alterations
underscores the central importance of the entire PTK family in
oncogenesis. Moreover, it provides further compelling support for
the development of multitargeted kinase inhibitors or combination
of complementary therapeutics as cancer treatments that may be
adapted to the pathologic and genetic parameters of an individual
patient. The extensive characterization of established tumor cell
lines with respect to transcriptional profiles of genetic variations in
this currently most promising cancer target family will aid in the
selection of suitable cell systems, data interpretation and target
validation, and thereby support preclinical development of novel
targeted cancer drugs.
