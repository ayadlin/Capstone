Abstract
In the present study, treatment of HEK-293 cells with the
synthetic small molecule N-iodoacetyl-tryptophan (I-Trp) at
submicromolar concentrations efficiently induced cell apoptosis as judged from the accumulation of sub-G0 cells and
intracellular DNA fragmentation. Activation of all intracellular caspases, except caspase-1, was detected in I-Trp–treated
cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that B-tubulin acted as a
specific intracellular target of I-Trp. Protein fingerprinting
analysis indicated that the Cys354 residue in the peptide
fragment TAVCDIPPR of B-tubulin, which is located at the
binding interface with chaperonin containing TCP1-B (CCT-B),
was alkylated by I-Trp. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of
Cys354 (Cys-Ala) abolished the incorporation of I-Trp into
B-tubulin, suggesting Cys354 is indeed the targeting site of
I-Trp. Immunoprecipitation showed that the B-tubulin/CCT-B
complex was constitutively formed but disrupted after
treatment with I-Trp. Overexpression of the truncated
B-tubulin (T351-S364) or treatment with I-Trp or the synthetic
peptide Myr-TAVCDIPPRG caused more severe cell apoptosis
in multidrug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 cancer cells due to higher
levels of CCT-B relative to wild-type MES-SA cancer cells.
Silencing the expression of CCT-B rendered MES-SA/Dx5 cells
less sensitive to I-Trp–induced apoptotic cell death. These
findings suggest that the B-tubulin/CCT-B complex may serve
as an effective chemotherapeutic target for treating clinical
tubulin-binding agent-resistant or CCT-B–overexpressing
tumors. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6879–88]

Introduction
Iodoacetamide-based derivatives are known to interact with the
low pKa cysteine residues of intracellular proteins, such as tubulin
(1), myosin (2), actin (3), HMG-CoA reductase (4), sarcoplasmic
reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (5), and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B
(6), to yield S-carboxymethyl cysteine derivatives. Recently, 3(iodoacetamido)-benzoyl ethyl ester (3-IAABE) was found to inhibit
tubulin polymerization; cause a double blockade in the cell cycle at
the G1-S transition and M phase through the increased kinase
activities of cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, cyclin B, and cdc2;
and induce activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-6, as
well as the caspase-3 downstream effector, poly(ADP-ribose)

polymerase (PARP), and accompanied cellular DNA fragmentation
in CEM cells (7). In addition, 3-IAABE also inhibits the growth of
human hepatocarcinoma in nude mice by a 72% decrease in tumor
volume. This inhibition is more robust than treatment with
vincristine (7), a tubulin-binding and antimitotic agent indicating
the feasibility of using iodoacetamide-based derivatives in clinical
cancer therapies.
Tubulin is a subunit of intracellular microtubules and is
composed of an a and h heterodimer (8). Unlike a-tubulin, which
binds GTP irreversibly, h-tubulin binds GTP reversibly and
hydrolyzes it to GDP (9). Changes in the concentration of
intracellular GDP-bound h-tubulin is known to affect intracellular
microtubule dynamics (10), which play critical role in regulating
the separation of chromosomes during meiosis and mitosis
(11, 12). Several anticancer agents, such as paclitaxel (13),
vinblastine (14), and colchicine (15), were designed to disrupt the
a/h tubulin heterodimer so as to inhibit microtubule dynamics
(16). However, occurrence of drug-resistant tumor cells limits the
use of these antimitotic agents in current clinical cancer therapies.
Although the molecular mechanisms promoting the induction of
drug-resistant tumor cells remain unclear, the overexpression
(17–20) or mutation (21, 22) of h-tubulin isotypes is thought to be
crucial for this event.
Chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT) is involved in the folding of
cytoskeleton proteins, actin and tubulin (23), and other intracellular proteins, such as cyclin E1 (24), histone deacetylase (25), and
protein phosphatase PP2A regulatory subunit B (26). CCT is
divided into eight different subunits (a, h, g, y, q, ~, D, and u), each
with an approximate molecular mass of 60 kDa. Although the
functions of CCT containing complexes are still not well
understood, the interaction of CCT with tubulin has been
illustrated using cryoelectron microscopic (CryoEM) analysis (27).
The docking model reveals that CCT subunits interact with
different regions of a/h tubulin heterodimers to stabilize the
microtubular structure (27). In the case of h-tubulin, for example,
CCT-h interacts with the fragment V353-P357 within its COOH
terminal region (27).
Although eukaryotic CCT plays an important function in
maintaining cellular homoeostasis by assisting the folding of many
proteins, the nature of those proteins and the involved cellular
pathways have not yet been established. The present study offers a
detailed illustration of h-tubulin/CCT-h complex interruption by a
synthetic small molecule, N-iodoacetyl-tryptophan (I-Trp), via its
incorporation at the Cys354 residue of h-tubulin. Furthermore, this
interaction elicited caspase-dependent signaling and consequent
cellular apoptosis. Our results also show that interrupting the
constitutive h-tubulin/CCT-h complex causes more severe cell
apoptosis in the multidrug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 uterine cancer
cells when compared with wild-type MES-SA cells. These
observations indicate that targeting the h-tubulin/CCT-h complex

Mass spectrometric analysis. HEK-293 cells or recombinant h-tubulin
(100 Ag) were treated with I-Trp-Dan (1 Amol/L) for 24 h at 37jC or
2 h at room temperature in the dark, respectively. I-Trp-Dan–treated
cell lysates (100 Ag) or recombinant h-tubulin (30 Ag) were subjected to
electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The fluorescence-labeled
protein band, visualized under a UV lamp, was excised from the gel
and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion and liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometric analysis. The raw data
were converted to the Mascot (Matrix Science) generic format and searched
against the NCBInr human protein database. For protein fingerprinting
analysis, the resultant m/z values of each peptide fragment were compared
with predicted molecular weight of peptide fragment derived from h-tubulin
IVb subtype to assess possible I-Trp-Dan–mediated alkylation of cysteines.
Cell transfection. The gene encoding the h-tubulin T351-S364 fragment
was synthesized by Mission Biotech and subcloned into an EGFP-IRES2
vector with an XhoI/EcoRI restriction site. The transfection of plasmid DNA
or CCT-h small interfering RNA (siRNA) was performed according to
Lipofectamine transfection guidelines (Invitrogen).
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cell lysate (100 Ag) or recombinant
h-tubulin (20 Ag) was subjected to SDS-PAGE. In the case of I-Trp-Dan

compound treatment, proteins were detected by exposure to UV light (280
nm) before Coomassie blue staining. For Western blotting, proteins were
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and
incubated with an antibody against h-tubulin, CCT-h, caspase-7, caspase-9,
or PARP. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibody, immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using
the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Bioscience).
Immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates (200 Ag) were diluted in 1 mL
of cell lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mmol/L NaCl,
3 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 4%
protease inhibitor cocktail; Merck Biosciences] and incubated with 2 Ag
of anti–h-tubulin antibody for 2 h at 4jC, followed by precipitation with
20 AL of protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4jC. The immunoprecipitates
were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using a CCT-h antibody.
In addition, the blots were stripped using a commercial kit (Millipore) and
reprobed with an anti–h-tubulin antibody.
Flow cytometric analysis. Cells (6  105) were fixed in 70% ice-cold
ethanol for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS once
and then incubated with propidium iodide (PI) staining solution (PBS
containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% RNase A, and 20 ng/mL of PI)

magnetic resonance analyses (data not shown). The treatment of
HEK-293 cells with 1 Amol/L I-Asp, I-Glu, I-Ser, and I-Trp (chemical
structures shown in Fig. 1A), but not I-Gly, I-Lys, or iodoacetamide,
induced the accumulation of sub-G0 cell population compared
with untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Effects of these
compounds on sub-G0 cell accumulation of HEK-293 cells were
dose dependent at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 Amol/L
(Fig. 1B, left) and also caused intracellular DNA fragmentation
(Fig. 1B, right), indicating intracellular apoptotic signaling. Based
on flow cytometric analysis, I-Trp exhibited the most potent
cytotoxic effect on HEK-293 cells. Thereafter, we used the I-Trp
compound in subsequent experiments to elucidate the mechanism
by which it induced cell apoptosis.

intracellular apoptotic signaling (29), the activities of intracellular

caspases were determined in I-Trp–treated HEK-293 cells. Except
caspase-1, the increased activities of caspase-2 through caspase-10
were detected after HEK-293 cells were treated for 24 hours with
I-Trp (1 Amol/L), but not iodoacetamide (Fig. 1C). Especially,
I-Trp induced an approximate of 2.5-fold elevation in caspase-3/
caspase-7 activities in HEK-293 cells compared with control cells
(Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the inclusion of caspase-3/caspase-7
peptide inhibitor (DEVD) at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to
3 Amol/L significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed the I-Trp–induced
sub-G0 cell accumulation of HEK-293 cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1D).
Identification of intracellular protein target(s) of I-Trp in
HEK-293 cells. To identify the intracellular protein target(s) of
I-Trp, a dansylated I-Trp compound (I-Trp-Dan; Fig. 2A, insert) was
synthesized and given to HEK-293 cell cultures. As shown in
Fig. 2A, I-Trp-Dan induced generation of apoptotic cells in a
dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to
2 Amol/L. SDS-PAGE analysis of cell lysates obtained from I-Trp-

Dan (1 Amol/L)–treated cells revealed a fluorescent protein band
with a molecular weight of f55 kDa after exposure of the gel to UV
light (Fig. 2B). The fluorescent protein band was excised from gel
and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. As shown in
Supplementary Table S1, CCT-h subunit, tubulin a/h subunits,
and other proteins were identified in the mass spectrometric
analysis. These proteins all have similar molecular weights and
run on SDS-PAGE at similar positions. To identify the real target,
an I-Trp-B compound (Fig. 2C, insert) was synthesized and
incubated with HEK-293 cell lysates. Subsequently, proteins
covalently linked to this I-Trp-B compound were purified by
affinity chromatography using a streptavidin-immobilized column.
Large amounts of unbound proteins were washed from the
column, and a small quantity of streptavidin-bound protein was
eluted using a urea solution (Fig. 2D). Western blot analysis
revealed that h-tubulin, not a-tubulin or CCT-h, was present in the
eluted solution (Fig. 2D), suggesting that h-tubulin acts as an
intracellular protein target of I-Trp in HEK-293 cells.

To further confirm that h-tubulin was an authentic target
of I-Trp, recombinant h-tubulin was produced as described in
Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig. 3A, the treatment of
recombinant h-tubulin, not CCT-h (Supplementary Fig. S2), with
the I-Trp-Dan compound generated a fluorescent protein band on
SDS-PAGE after UV light exposure. Furthermore, the incubation of
recombinant h-tubulin with I-Asp, I-Glu, I-Ser, I-Trp, or I-Trp-B
compounds before the I-Trp-Dan treatment abrogated generation
of the fluorescent protein band (Fig. 3B), indicating that those
synthesized compounds likely interacted and alkylated the same
cysteine residue of h-tubulin.
Furthermore, protein fingerprinting analyses indicated that the
Cys354 residue within the h-tubulin fragment TAVCDIPPR was
alkylated with the I-Trp-Dan compound. This observation is based
on the resultant mass spectrometer peak at m/z = 1532.751,
approximately equal to the predicted mass values of the
TAVCDIPPR peptide fragment incorporated with an N-acetyl-TrpDan group (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the wild-type h-tubulin, a
Cys354Ala mutant failed to produce a fluorescently labeled band on
SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C), consistent with the conclusion that Cys354
reacted with I-Trp. Interestingly, the Cys354 residue is located
within the peptide fragment VCDIP of h-tubulin (the magenta
region in Supplementary Fig. S3), which serves as the CCT-h
binding site (27). We further found that I-Trp caused the disruption
of the constitutively formed h-tubulin/CCT-h complex, as judged
by the reduced immunoprecipitates of h-tubulin/CCT-h complex
in cell lysates of I-Trp–treated HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3D).
Intermolecular interactions between the I-Trp compound
and B-tubulin. Because the I-Trp compound disrupts constitutively associated h-tubulin/CCT-h complex by alkylating the Cys354
residue of h-tubulin, computer modeling was used to simulate the
intermolecular interactions between I-Trp and h-tubulin. Docking
experiments display that I-Trp binds to h-tubulin at the region near
the Cys354 residue (Fig. 4A). The intermolecular distance between
the iodo group of I-Trp and the SH group of Cys354 was calculated
to be 3.24 Å (enlarged in Fig. 4A). Possible hydrogen bond
interactions with the Asp355 residue and hydrophobic interactions
with Leu42, Pro243, Gly244, and Gln245 residues of h-tubulin may also
be formed (Supplementary Fig. S4B). These interactions ensure the
specific incorporation of I-Trp into this region of h-tubulin. Similar
binding modes of I-Trp-Dan and I-Trp-B with h-tubulin were also
predicted in the same region (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B).
Effect of the I-Trp compound on tubulin polymerization.
The binding site of I-Trp in h-tubulin (Fig. 4B, peptide fragment
VCDIP in magenta and Cys354 in yellow) is different from those of
other h-tubulin–binding agents, such as Taxol (Fig. 4B, TXL),
colchicine, and vinblastine (Supplementary Fig. S3). As shown in
the insert in Fig. 4C, the pretreatment of recombinant h-tubulin
with paclitaxel, as well as colchicine and vinblastine (data not
shown), did not affect the incorporation of I-Trp-Dan into htubulin. Unlike paclitaxel, the treatment with I-Trp failed to induce
in vitro tubulin polymerization (Fig. 4C).
Effects of interrupting the B-tubulin/CCT-B interaction
in multidrug-resistant cancer cells. Cys354 residue of h-tubulin
is located within the CCT-h–binding sequence VCDIP, which is
conserved in all h-tubulin isotypes of mammalian cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, MES-SA/Dx5 cell line, a multidrugresistant derivative from uterine MES-SA sarcoma cell line (30),
was used to examine whether interrupting h-tubulin/CCT-h
association contributes a new strategy to treat tumors with drug
resistance to h-tubulin–binding agents, such as paclitaxel,

vinblastine, and colchicine. MES-SA and MES-SA/Dx5 cells were
cultivated and transfected with the gene encoding the peptide
fragment TAVCDIPPR to block the formation of the intracellular htubulin/CCT-h complex. As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of this
peptide fragment caused a more predominant accumulation of
sub-G0 cells in MES-SA/Dx5 cells compared with the wild-type
MES-SA cells. Particularly, in the cells transfected with 2 Ag of
plasmid containing this truncated h-tubulin gene, an approximate
of 10-fold larger population of sub-G0 cells was observed in MESSA/Dx5 cells relative to MES-SA cells (Fig. 5A, left) and intracellular
DNA fragmentation (right) was detected. Similar observations were
made using 1 Amol/L I-Trp or 10 to 100 Amol/L myristoylated
synthetic peptide (Myr-TAVCDIPPRG; Supplementary Fig. S6).
Furthermore, immunoprecipition revealed that overexpression of
the truncated h-tubulin reduced the formation of intracellular htubulin/CCT-h complex in MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly,
Western blot analysis revealed that an increased CCT-h, not htubulin, protein expression was detected in MES-SA/Dx5 cells
compared with the wild-type MES-SA cells (Fig. 5C). This could
explain the predominant activity of overexpressed h-tubulin
fragment in causing sub-G0 cell accumulation in MES-SA/Dx5
cells. The knockdown of CCT-h expression using CCT-h–specific
siRNA markedly suppressed endogenous CCT-h protein levels
(Fig. 5D, top ) and significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited I-Trp
compound–induced sub-G0 cell accumulation in MES-SA/Dx5 cells
compared with untreated and control experiments (Fig. 5D).
Caspase activation in MES-SA/Dx5 cells transfected with
truncated B-tubulin. Further experiments were performed to
examine the activation of caspase proteins during apoptosis of
MES-SA/Dx5 cells induced by the overexpression of the h-tubulin
peptide fragment T351-S364. As shown in Fig. 6A, except caspase-1,
all the other caspases were activated in the MES-SA/Dx5 cells
transfected with the truncated h-tubulin. The cleaved forms of
caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 (Fig. 6B) and the fragmentation
of PARP, an intracellular downstream target of caspase-3/caspase-7
(Fig. 6C), were observed in the MES-SA/Dx5 cells transfected (T)
with truncated h-tubulin gene compared with the untreated (U)
control. Interestingly, the profile of caspase activation in the
truncated h-tubulin–expressing MES-SA/Dx5 cells was similar
to that in the I-Trp–treated HEK-293 cells, indicating that a unique
intracellular caspase cascade is involved in mediating apoptotic
signaling induced by interrupting constitutive h-tubulin/CCT-h
complexes (see Discussion).

Discussion
CryoEM analysis reveals that CCT-h interacts with amino acid
residues 353 to 357 (VCDIP) of h-tubulin (27), a region highly
conserved in h-tubulin isotypes (see Supplementary Fig. S5).
By mass spectrometric analysis, the conserved Cys354 residue of
h-tubulin was identified to serve as the incorporation site of I-Trp
compound. Furthermore, treatment with I-Trp or overexpression of
truncated h-tubulin (T351-S364) indeed reduced the formation of
intracellular h-tubulin/CCT-h complexes and caused cell apoptosis. Because I-Trp did not affect in vitro tubulin polymerization
(Fig. 4C), the disruption of intracellular h-tubulin/CCT-h complexes by I-Trp may induce cell apoptosis by causing microtubule
disassembly in accordance with the results presented in a previous
study (31).
Recently, tubulin-binding agent–resistant tumors were considered to be correlated with the occurrence of h-tubulin mutations

Blocking b-Tubulin/CCT-b Complex Causes Cell Apoptosis

(22) or overexpression of individual h-tubulin isotypes (17, 19, 20)
such as class III h-tubulin. Our data indicate that CCT-h is highly
expressed in multidrug-resistant MES-SA/Dx-5 uterine cancer cells,
and the destruction of intracellular h-tubulin/CCT-h complex by
the small molecule I-Trp, synthetic peptide Myr-TAVCDIPPRG
(T351-G360), or overexpression of the h-tubulin fragment T351S364 causes a predominant cell apoptosis response in MES-SA/
Dx-5 cells when compared with wild-type MES-SA cells. Conversely,
the knockdown of CCT-h protein expression rendered MES-SA/Dx5
cells less sensitive to apoptotic signals elicited through interrupting
constitutive h-tubulin/CCT-h complex by I-Trp compound. Because
increased CCT-h expression is also detectable in several malignant
tumors (32) and might occur commonly in drug-resistant tumors,
the constitutive h-tubulin/CCT-h complex may serve as a useful
chemotherapeutic target for treating clinical multidrug-resistant
or CCT-h-overexpressing tumors.
The interaction of microtubules with mitochondria was
identified in myocytes (33) and brain cells (34). Recently,
microtubular depolymerization was found to induce mitochondriadependent apoptotic signaling accompanied with activation of
caspase-9 and caspase-3 (35). On the other hand, the treatment
with tubulin-binding agent Taxol transactivates the intracellular
domain of the Notch receptor and modulates the Notch signaling
pathway–dependent survival of several cancer cells (36, 37).
Besides, the association of tubulin with other receptors, including
the muscarinic receptor (38), g-aminobutyric acid receptor (39),
purinergic receptor (40), and interleukin-2 receptor (41), was also
previously documented. This information supports our data
indicating that the disruption of the constitutive h-tubulin/
CCT-h complex by treatment with I-Trp or transfection with the
h-tubulin fragment (T351-S364) activates both intrinsic (caspase-3,
caspase-6, caspase-7, and caspase-9) and extrinsic (caspase-2,
caspase-8, and caspase-10) caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling.
Although caspase-1 clusters phylogenetically with caspase-4 and
caspase-5 and is a member of the group of the so-called
inflammatory caspases, caspase-4 and caspase-5–dependent apoptotic signaling is not mediated by caspase-1 (42). Furthermore, the
in vitro cleavage of pro-caspase-3 by caspase-4 and caspase-5
suggests that caspase-4 and caspase-5 might be involved in
the intracellular apoptotic signaling through activated caspase-3

(42–44). In the present study, either I-Trp treatment or the
truncated h-tubulin transfection induced the activation of intracellular caspase-4 and caspase-5, but not caspase-1. A reasonable
interpretation is that caspase-1 might be specialized to mediate
extracellular inflammatory signals (45, 46), because caspase-1
expression was detectable in HEK-293 cells (47, 48). On the other
hand, recent studies show that caspase-4 is localized to the surface
of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in ER
stress–induced apoptosis. Besides, it was well known that
intracellular ER movement is dependent on microtubule mobilization (49, 50). Thus, caspase-4 activation may reflect the involvement
of ER-dependent apoptotic signaling during h-tubulin/CCT-h
complex–dependent apoptosis.
In conclusion, the interaction of iodoacetamide derivatives with
the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues provides a useful
approach for us to discover a novel intracellular target for cancer
therapy. By using the I-Trp-Dan compound, which was specifically
incorporated into h-tubulin in HEK-293 cells, we define a novel
h-tubulin/CCT-h–dependent apoptotic event mediated by intrinsic, extrinsic, and ER-dependent caspase signaling cascades. Our
data also show that disrupting constitutive h-tubulin/CCT-h
complexes via overexpression of truncated h-tubulin causes a
more severe cell apoptosis in multidrug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 cells
compared with wild-type MES-SA cells. Because the binding site of
CCT-h is conserved among h-tubulin isotypes and is located away
from the vinblastine-, colchicine-, and taxol-binding sites, the
modulation of h-tubulin/CCT-h complex dynamics may serve as a
useful chemotherapeutic strategy for treating tubulin-binding
agent–resistant tumors.
