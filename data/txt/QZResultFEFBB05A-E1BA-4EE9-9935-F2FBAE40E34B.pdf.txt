ABSTRACT
Mer and Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated as therapeutic
targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this manuscript we describe UNC1666,
a novel ATP-competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which potently
diminishes Mer and Flt3 phosphorylation in AML. Treatment with UNC1666 mediated
biochemical and functional effects in AML cell lines expressing Mer or Flt3 internal
tandem duplication (ITD), including decreased phosphorylation of Mer, Flt3 and
downstream effectors Stat, Akt and Erk, induction of apoptosis in up to 98% of cells,
and reduction of colony formation by greater than 90%, compared to treatment with
vehicle. These effects were dose-dependent, with inhibition of downstream signaling
and functional effects correlating with the degree of Mer or Flt3 kinase inhibition.
Treatment of primary AML patient samples expressing Mer and/or Flt3-ITD with
UNC1666 also inhibited Mer and Flt3 intracellular signaling, induced apoptosis, and
inhibited colony formation. In summary, UNC1666 is a novel potent small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that decreases oncogenic signaling and myeloblast survival,
thereby validating dual Mer/Flt3 inhibition as an attractive treatment strategy for AML.

cells are urgently needed to improve both patient outcomes
and long-term quality of life.
The Mer receptor tyrosine kinase is abnormally
expressed on 80–100% of AML patient samples, whereas
little or no Mer is expressed in normal bone marrow
precursor cells [8, 9]. Mer activation in AML cell lines
leads to pro-survival signaling, including phosphorylation
of Erk1/2, Akt and Stat6. Inhibition of Mer in AML
via RNA interference led to a significant increase in
myeloblast apoptosis, decreased colony formation in
methylcellulose, and prolonged leukemia-free survival
in a murine xenograft model [8]. These findings led us
to determine that aberrant Mer expression (rather than
activating mutation in the kinase domain) provides a

INTRODUCTION
Though the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) has significantly improved over the past 30 years,
average five-year survival rates are still less than 60%
for pediatric patients and are progressively worse for
older adult and elderly patients [1, 2]. The high-intensity
chemotherapy needed to induce remission in AML is often
prohibitive in elderly patients due to excessive mortality
[3, 4], and is known to cause concerning long-term toxic
side effects, including growth abnormalities, cardiac
dysfunction, neurocognitive deficits, and gonadal failure
in pediatric patients [5–7]. Novel therapies that effectively

survival advantage in leukemia. Taken together, these
data suggest that Mer kinase inhibition may selectively
target leukemia cells, while sparing normal bone marrow
progenitors.
Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations
of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) receptor,
found in ~20–30% of adult AML patient samples and
~15% of pediatric AML samples, is associated with
poor prognosis in both patient populations [10–15].
Specifically, a high ratio of the FLT3-ITD mutant allele
relative to the wild type allele (> 0.4) has been associated
with a markedly poor progression-free survival [16].
Constitutive activation of Flt3 through the ITD mutation
leads to downstream activation of pro-survival signaling
pathways including Stat5, Akt and Erk1/2 [17, 18].
Given that Flt3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have
been effective in preclinical models of AML, Flt3
inhibition is currently being tested in patients with Flt3ITD mutations. Unfortunately, resistance to Flt3 targeted
TKIs has been reported, including selection for novel
point mutations [19, 20]. Interestingly, different Flt3
inhibitors do not appear to have overlapping resistance
mutation profiles [21], such that mutations resulting in
resistance to one inhibitor may not confer resistance to
another. Furthermore, adverse side effects have been
reported in patients treated with existing Flt-3 inhibitors,
including the recent restrictions on clinical use of
ponatinib due to higher than expected rates of arterial
thrombosis [22]. Issues with resistance and adverse
toxicities demonstrate the need to develop new, more
effective therapeutic agents.
Given the high prevalence of expression of both Mer
and Flt3 and the data indicating their oncogenic roles in
AML, targeting them together is an attractive therapeutic
strategy, and could potentially result in better outcomes
in high-risk patients, reduced need for chemotherapy in
low-risk patients, or a therapeutic option for those who
cannot tolerate high-intensity chemotherapy. We have
developed UNC1666, a novel Mer and Flt3 targeted
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with therapeutic
potential in AML. In this publication, we show that this
ATP-binding site competitive small molecule potently
and selectively inhibits Mer and Flt3 kinase activation
and downstream signal transduction resulting in growth
inhibition and apoptosis of AML cell lines and primary
patient myeloblasts.

scaffold with better solubility was introduced using
a structure-based design approach [24]. UNC1666, a
pyrrolopyrimidine analogue with a structure similar to
UNC1062, is also an ATP-competitive type I inhibitor
(Figure 1A). Analysis of the inhibition constant (Ki)
proved this compound to be more potent and selective
for Mer (MCE IC50 0.55 nM; Ki 0.16 nM) compared to
previously described Mer inhibitors [23, 25]. Additionally,
UNC1666 inhibits Flt3 (MCE IC50 0.69 nM; Ki 0.67 nM)
equipotently in enzymatic MCE assays. A comprehensive
protein kinase profiling panel provided by Carna
Biosciences was used to assess off-target kinase inhibition
mediated by UNC1666 at a concentration of 46 nM, more
than 50-fold higher than its MCE IC50 values against Mer
and Flt3 (Supplemental Table 2). Only the Trk proteins
were inhibited greater than 95% in response to treatment
with UNC1666. Additional MCE assays were performed
to determine inhibition of TrkA (as a surrogate for the
Trk family kinases) and revealed similar potency (MCE
IC50 0.57 nM) (Supplemental Table 2). Furthermore, we
analyzed the effect of UNC1666 on both Tyro-3 and Axl
(members of the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase family
along with Mer), which demonstrated enzymatic MCE
IC50 values of 29 nM and 37 nM, respectively.
The small molecule UNC1653 (Figure 1B) has a
pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold similar to UNC1062. One
of the hinge binding hydrogen bonds was disrupted by
introducing a methyl group, which dramatically reduced
Mer and Flt3 activity. In these studies, we used UNC1653
as a negative control TKI given that it has weak inhibition
of both Mer (MCE IC50 560 nM) and Flt3 (MCE IC50
220 nM) relative to UNC1666.

UNC1666 reduces Mer and Flt3-mediated
anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signaling
We have previously described survival and
proliferation signaling resulting from Mer tyrosine kinase
activity in AML, including increased activation of Erk1/2,
Akt and Stat6 [8]. Similarly, others have demonstrated that
Erk1/2, Akt and Stat5 are critical downstream survival and
proliferation signals in AML cells with Flt3-ITD mutations
[17, 18]. Given the degree of overlap in Mer and Flt3ITD signaling pathways, we first determined whether
UNC1666 could inhibit each kinase independently in
AML cell lines. The Kasumi-1 and NOMO-1 cell lines
express Mer but do not have activating Flt3 mutations.
We previously showed that short hairpin RNA-mediated
inhibition of Mer expression in the Kasumi-1 and NOMO1 cell lines increased stress-induced apoptosis and
decreased colony formation [8]. Conversely, we analyzed
MV4;11 (homozygous for the Flt3-ITD, high allelic ratio
or “Flt3-ITDhighAR”) and MOLM-13 (heterogygous for
the Flt3-ITD, low allelic ratio or “Flt3-ITDlowAR”), which
express little (“dim”) and no Mer respectively, and have
been used extensively as models of leukemia with Flt3ITD mutations.

UNC1666, a novel dual specific Mer and Flt3
tyrosine kinase inhibitor
We previously reported UNC1062 [23], a selective
ATP-competitive type I inhibitor of Mer. However, its low
solubility and poor in vivo pharmacokinetic properties
made UNC1062 unsuitable for in vivo studies. To

immunoblot and demonstrate presence or absence of the Mer tyrosine kinase (above) and the Flt3 tyrosine kinase (middle). Actin is shown
as an indicator of total protein (below).

Using these cell lines, we confirmed that shortterm treatment with UNC1666 reduced Mer and
Flt3 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner,
compared to vehicle alone (DMSO) or negative control
UNC1653 (Figure 2A & 2B). UNC1666 decreased Flt3
phosphorylation more potently in Flt3-ITD cell lines,
as compared to Flt3 wild-type cell lines (Figure 2B and
data not shown). Mer and Flt3 phospho-protein levels
were reduced by approximately half at concentrations of
100 nM and 50 nM, respectively.
To investigate whether inhibition of other kinases
might contribute to effects mediated by UNC1666, we also
assessed expression of the Trk kinases as well as Tyro-3 and
Axl. The cells lines used for these studies express very little
or no Tyro-3, Axl or Trk protein (Supplemental Figure 1).
We then evaluated downstream Erk, Akt and Stat
signaling after a two hour treatment with UNC1666.
There was a consistent dose-dependent abrogation of
Erk1/2, Akt and Stat6 phosphorylation in Mer expressing

cell lines treated with UNC1666 compared to vehicle or
UNC1653 (Figure 2C and Supplemental Figure 2). The
decreased phosphorylation of these molecules correlated
with the decrease in Mer phosphorylation (Figures 2A
and 2C); diminished phosphorylation was noted at 50 nM, a
moderate decrease at 100 nM, and more complete inhibition
at 300  nM. Additionally, phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Akt
and Stat5 was markedly diminished in the Flt3-ITD cell
lines after treatment with UNC1666 compared to vehicle or
UNC1653 (Figure 2D and Supplemental Figure 2). Again,
decreased phosphorylation of these pro-survival signaling
molecules in Flt3-ITD cell lines correlated with a decrease
in Flt3 phosphorylation (Figures 2B and 2D); near complete
ablation of phosphorylation was observed at 50 nM.

of Mer-positive cell lines with UNC1666 resulted
in a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis relative
to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 3B & Supplemental
Figure  3A). Mer-expressing cell lines exhibited a
significant induction of apoptosis in 50–67% of cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

at 100 nM and an even more dramatic induction of
apoptosis in 68–76% of cells at 300 nM. For example, in
the Kasumi-1 cell line 30 ± 7% of cells were apoptotic
or dead after 72 hour treatment with vehicle compared
to 76 ± 8% after treatment with 300 nM UNC1666 (p <
0.001). Importantly, apoptosis was induced at the same
concentrations of UNC1666 required for inhibition of
Mer (Figures 2A and 3B). In Flt3-ITD cell lines, treatment
with UNC1666 resulted in an even more dramatic
induction of apoptosis (Figure 3B & Supplemental

Figure 3A). At 50 nM, 54–67% of Flt3-ITD cells were
apoptotic or dead, increasing up to 90–98% at 300 nM.
More specifically, the MV4;11 cell line demonstrated
13 ± 3% apoptosis after treatment with vehicle versus
90 ± 1% after treatment with 300 nM UNC1666, and the
MOLM-13 cell line demonstrated respective means of 8
± 1% and 98 ± 2% (both p < 0.001). Again, induction of

apoptosis correlated with inhibition of Flt3 (Figures 2B
and 3B). Treatment with negative control UNC1653 did
not induce apoptosis in Mer-expressing or Flt3-ITD cell
lines (Figure 3B). Induction of apoptosis was confirmed
by immunoblot demonstrating increased cleavage of
PARP and Caspase-3 after treatment with UNC1666
(Figure 3C). Cell cycle analysis indicated a trend towards

in AML cell lines

accumulation of cells in G2M phase with 4N DNA
content and this was significant at the 300 nM dose of
UNC1666 (Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 3B).

To assess the effect of UNC1666 in a longer-term
assay which might more closely approximate the threedimensional environment encountered in vivo, AML cell
lines were plated in equal number in soft agar and treated
with UNC1666, negative control UNC1653, or vehicle in
the overlaying medium. Vehicle treatment was assessed in
duplicate and data from samples treated with UNC1666
or UNC1653 were normalized to the mean vehicle colony
number for each experiment. Treatment with UNC1666
significantly decreased colony formation compared to
cells treated with medium containing vehicle or UNC1653
(Figure 5C & Supplemental Figure 3D). The Kasumi-1
and NOMO-1 cell lines demonstrated a 90 ± 6% and
71 ± 4% reduction in colony formation, respectively, in
response to 100 nM UNC1666, while the MV4;11 and
MOLM-13 cells line demonstrated a 61 ± 22% and 93
± 6% reduction in colonies, respectively, in response to
treatment with 50 nM UNC1666 (p < 0.001).

UNC1666 affects growth & proliferation of AML
cells even after treatment
Malignant cells have previously demonstrated
rebound growth after removal of TKIs in some clinical
trials [26]. To evaluate the sustained effect of UNC1666
on cell growth and survival after removal of treatment,
AML cell lines were cultured with UNC1666 or vehicle
for 72 hours, then cells were washed and replated at
1.5  ×  104 viable cells/ml in normal culture conditions
(Day 0). Cells were counted after six days of culture
(Day 6) to assess rebound growth (Figure 5A). Although
30–75% of cells remain viable after treatment with
50 nM UNC1666 compared to vehicle (Figure 3B and
Supplemental Figure 3A), these cells demonstrate a
significant decrease in their ability to proliferate even
after UNC1666 removal (Figure 5B and Supplemental
Figure 3C). Samples treated with higher concentrations
of UNC1666 had even more striking cell proliferation
defects, leading to only a minimal number of viable cells
at Day 6 in all four cell lines. The Kasumi-1 cell line
treated with vehicle demonstrated an average 14-fold
increase in viable cell number (from 1.5 × 104 to 2.0 × 105
viable cells/ml) over six days, whereas those treated with
100 nM UNC1666 only increased 2.5-fold (to 0.3 × 105
cells/ml) (p < 0.001). The MV4;11 cell line treated with
vehicle demonstrated an average 67-fold increase (from
1.5 × 104 to 10 × 105 viable cells/ml) whereas cells
treated with 50 nM UNC1666 only increased 13-fold
(to 2.0 × 105 viable cells/ml) (p < 0.001).

Mer and wild-type Flt3 expression levels were
assessed in blasts obtained from six patients diagnosed
with acute myeloid leukemia using immunoblot analysis
(Figure 6A), and FLT3-ITD alleles were detected using
standard clinical molecular techniques (Figure 6B).
Additional clinical information relevant to each patient

studies, we have not identified any cell line other than
MV4;11 (which expresses very little Mer) that jointly

by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide to identify stage of cell cycle. Graphic representation of cell cycle progress in

however five out of six of our randomly obtained patient
samples did co-express these molecules. All samples
expressed Mer (consistent with our previously published
results), but demonstrated a range of Mer expression
levels (Figure 6A). Since sensitivity of Mer expressing
malignant cell lines does not appear to directly correlate
with the degree of Mer expression (data not shown) and
Mer dependence may instead be related to autocrine ligand
expression or some other property of the cell, we opted to
score all patient samples that express Mer as Mer positive

to have a low allelic ratio. Since there is a correlation
between high allelic ratio of the Flt3-ITD (> 0.4) and
poor prognosis in patients [16], we accordingly denoted
when a patient sample was of high (“Flt3-ITDhighAR”) or
low (“Flt3-ITDlowAR”) Flt3 allelic ratio. None of the patient
samples demonstrate detectable levels of Trk proteins

whole cell lysates and immunoblot analysis confirmed
inhibition of both kinases in response to UNC1666
(Figure  6C). Phosphorylation of both Mer and Flt3
was inhibited by greater that 50% after treatment with
UNC1666 at concentrations as low as 50 nM, though
it is notable that UNC1666 appears to decrease Flt3
phosphorylation at a lower dose compared to its effect
on Mer, similar to what was observed in cell lines.
Immunoblot analysis of Erk1/2, Akt and Stat5 phosphoproteins demonstrated marked decreases in response to
UNC1666 treatment (Figure 6D), which correlated the
decrease in Mer and Flt3 phosphorylation status.

of normal umbilical cord blood samples. In these studies
there was no significant reduction in colony number at
doses up to 500 nM UNC1666 (n = 3, Figure 7C). Upon
treatment with 1 μM UNC1666, there is a trend towards
decreased colony formation, and this becomes statistically
significant at a dose of 10 μM.

DISCUSSION
The unacceptable cure rate and toxic consequences
of intensive chemotherapy support the development of
novel targeted therapies to improve long-term clinical
outcomes in AML. Our previous work demonstrated
the upregulation of the Mer tyrosine kinase in nearly
all adult and pediatric patient samples collected at
diagnosis or relapse. In contrast, normal bone marrow
progenitors express very little Mer [8, 9]. We previously
found that inhibition of Mer using RNA interference
induced apoptosis and decreased proliferation in vitro and
prolonged survival in vivo in xenograft models. These
results indicated a potential therapeutic role for Mer
kinase inhibition. In an effort to discover Mer-selective
inhibitors, we generated UNC1666, which also inhibits
Flt3 at nearly equal potency in enzymatic assays. The
sequence identity between the binding pockets of Mer and
Flt3 (defined as all residues whose side chains are within
4.5 Å distance from UNC1666) is > 90% (one differing
residue). In contrast, the sequence identity for the full
Mer kinase domain compared to the full kinase domain
of Flt3 is ~30%. UNC1666 exhibits selectivity for Mer
and Flt3 over other kinases tested, with greater than 50fold selectivity over closely related and structurally similar
kinases Tyro-3 and Axl, co-members with Mer in the TAM
family.
We have found that Mer and Flt3-ITD can be coexpressed on AML patient samples, though a larger cohort
of patient samples is needed to determine the frequency
of dual Mer expression and Flt3-ITD mutation. Currently,
little is known about the physical association of Mer and
Flt3 receptors on leukemic blasts. Though studies to assess
the physical association of Mer and Flt3 have not been
reported, co-localization of Flt-3 and Axl, a member of the
TAM kinase family along with Mer has been demonstrated
[27]. Based on the structural homology of Mer and Axl, it
is possible that Mer and Flt-3 might also co-localize and
perhaps directly associate.
Given that Flt3-ITD is a known oncogenic target in
AML and Mer is also known to play essential oncogenic
roles in AML cells, combined inhibition of Mer and Flt3 is
likely to be an effective strategy with broad applicability.
Thus, we tested the efficacy of our dual Mer/Flt3 TKI in
AML cell lines and patient samples. The MCE enzymatic
assay data indicate that UNC1666 inhibits Mer and
Flt3 with nearly equal potency. However, in cell-based
assays, UNC1666 was more effective at reducing Flt3
phosphorylation compared to Mer phosphorylation.

UNC1666 induces apoptosis in primary
AML patient samples
To replicate the conditions utilized with AML
cell lines, patient samples were treated with UNC1666
or vehicle and apoptosis was determined using flow
cytometry as described above. Patient samples were
co-cultured with HS27 stromal cells, which provide
essential factors to support myeloid cells and allowed us
to assess response to UNC1666. Under the stromal cell
enhanced growth conditions, treatment with UNC1666
was sufficient to induce apoptosis in all patient samples,
thereby demonstrating efficacy on AML blasts with a
wide range of Mer expression levels or Flt3-ITD status
(Figure  7A & Supplemental Figure 4B). Induction of
apoptosis in response to UNC1666 was independent
of position in the cell cycle, though at high doses may
correlate with accumulation in G2/M phase as previously
noted in AML cell lines (Supplemental Figure 4C).

UNC1666 decreases colony formation in
methylcellulose in primary AML patient samples
To determine the effects of UNC1666 on colonyforming potential, AML patient samples were cultured
in methylcellulose with the compound or vehicle for
10 days and colonies were counted in a blinded manner.
Patient samples grew variably under these conditions,
so experimental data are reported as colony number rela­
tive to vehicle-treated cultures to facilitate comparison
between samples. UNC1666 treatment dramatically
decreased colony numbers in all patient samples and
mediated near complete abrogation of colony formation
at concentrations as low as 50 nM in all but one sample
(Figure 7B & Supplemental Figure 4D).

UNC1666 provides a broad therapeutic dosing
window in normal hematopoietic precursors
A similar evaluation was performed to determine
the effects of treatment with UNC1666 or vehicle control
on hematopoietic precursors in methylcellulose cultures

Inhibition of Mer and Flt3 phosphorylation in cell based
assays correlated with functional effects mediated by
UNC1666 in cell lines expressing Mer or Flt3-ITD.
Previously, we demonstrated signaling downstream
of Mer through the pro-survival and anti-apoptotic
Erk1/2, Akt and Stat6 pathways in AML. Other groups
have shown similar downstream effectors of Flt3-ITD
including Erk1/2, Akt and Stat5. Though there are have
been additional effectors known downstream of both
Mer and Flt3 in various cell types, we chose to analyze
these molecules which function to promote cancer cell
growth and prevent apoptosis and have well-characterized
roles in leukemogenesis. In addition, other groups have
noted heterogeneity in the phosphorylation status of all
three of these molecules (in both Mer and/or Flt3-ITD
dependent cell lines) depending on the cell line, tumor
type, assay, and/or in vitro therapeutic intervention. Given
the heterogeneity of downstream effector phosphorylation
status in a given AML cell line or patient sample, blockade
of both Mer and Flt3 signaling may affect independent
downstream pathways and/or may function redundantly to
more effectively inhibit shared pathways. Targeting these
mutual pathways had a profound functional effect in AML
patient samples that co-expressed Mer and Flt3, including
decreased ability to evade apoptosis and decreased colony
formation. Each of these effects occurred at concentrations
between 5–100 nM, and correlated well with inhibition
of Mer and Flt3 phosphorylation in cell-based assays.
The observed correlations between inhibition of Mer or
Flt3 and functional anti-leukemia effects mediated by
UNC1666 in AML cells suggest that these effects are a
result of on-target inhibition of Mer and Flt3, rather than
non-specific inhibition of other kinases.
The studies presented here extend the action of
UNC1666 to primary patient AML blasts. Interestingly,
the anti-proliferative effects in patient samples were
even more dramatic than in cell lines with near complete
induction of apoptosis and growth inhibition at 50 nM.
The patient sample conditions (co-culture with stromal
cells) suggest that Mer inhibition is likely to be effective
even in the bone marrow microenvironment. The bone
marrow niche provides a potential rich source of paracrine
Gas6 [28, 29], a Mer ligand, and the ability of Mer
inhibitors to abrogate this niche survival pathway may
be crucial in improving clinical outcomes in patients.
Interestingly, in cell lines treatment with UNC1666 did
not have a significant effect on the cell cycle unless high
concentrations (300 nM) were used. This effect was also
observed in a subset of patient samples, although less
consistently. This suggests that blast survival is more
profoundly affected than proliferation, and that inhibition
of Mer or Flt3 decreases survival at any stage of the cell
cycle. Additionally, although patient-derived myeloblasts
are sensitive to UNC1666 in methylcellulose cultures at
concentrations as low as 5–50 nM, it is important to note
that UNC1666 did not affect the colony forming poten­
tial of hematopoietic progenitors in normal cord blood
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cultures, even at doses as high as 1 μM. These data suggest
the possibility of minimal bone marrow progenitor toxicity
in response to treatment with a dual Mer/Flt3 inhibitor
such as UNC1666, even at doses considerably higher
than are necessary to decrease receptor phosphorylation
and inhibit oncogenic phenotypes and indicate a wide
therapeutic window with minimal hematopoietic side
effects at doses up to 1 μM. Hematopoietic progenitors
have previously been described as Mer negative [8,
9]. Therefore, a Mer targeted inhibitor acting in the
bone marrow microenvironment is likely to target only
Mer-expressing leukemia cells.
Initially, UNC1666 was designed to have
greater solubility to improve in vivo bioavailability
and pharmacokinetics as compared to earlier Mer
inhibitors [23, 30]. Unfortunately, following intravenous
administration in a murine model, UNC1666 demonstrated
a terminal elimination half-life of 0.23 hour, and follow­
ing oral administration of UNC1666, the absolute oral
bioavailability was low (8%). Due to these observations,
we have continued optimization to seek compounds
that inhibit Mer and Flt3 with extended plasma halflife and improved bioavailability. However, the studies
presented here provide an important proof-of-principal
demonstrating that inhibition of Mer or Flt3 has a
profound effect on the survival and continued proliferation
of myeloblasts and suggest that inhibitors targeting both
of these kinases may be particularly effective and/or have
broad-spectrum clinical application in patients with AML.
Given that our in vitro work with primary patient samples
demonstrated a dramatic effect at concentrations well
within the range of what is clinically achievable using
orally bioavailable TKIs, we anticipate that improved
analogues will have similar results both in vitro and
in vivo.
Because UNC1666 has poor in vivo bioavailability
and a short half-life (data not shown), it was not possible
to assess the toxicity profile associated with dual Mer/
Flt3 inhibition in mice. As previously described, Flt3
inhibitors such as AC-220 are known have side effects
including myelosuppression, though this is variable and
is not present with some newer generation Flt3 inhibitors
[31] due to improved specificity and decreased off-target
effects. We would anticipate that UNC1666 would have
a side effect profile similar to these newer generation
inhibitors given that they have high specificity for Flt3.
Additionally, Mer is not expressed in normal marrow
progenitors [8, 9]. Previous analysis by our group on
bone marrow progenitors in Mer knockout mice show
there is a slight decrease in granulocyte-macrophage
populations compared to wild-type mice, which is of
questionable clinical significance [9]. Other progenitor or
stem cell populations were not affected in these studies. In
pedigrees describing humans with complete Mer protein
loss-of-function, the identified cases lived to adulthood,
though they develop clinical conditions such as retinitis
pigmentosa, which is thought to be mainly a result of
6732

Oncotarget

the long-term defects in Mer-dependent clearance of
apoptotic cells in the retina. In rat models of retinitis
pigmentosa with Mer gene deletion, when the Mer gene
was exogenously expressed in the retina, the disease
phenotype was corrected [32], indicating that the condition
was not permanent. These observations suggest that shortterm use of a Mer inhibitor for cancer therapy is unlikely
to have an effect as severe as the phenotype observed in
patients with Mer loss-of-function mutations and that any
observed effects will be reversible. These observations
suggest that short-term use of a Mer inhibitor for cancer
therapy is unlikely to have an effect as severe as the
phenotype observed in patients with Mer loss-of-function
mutations and that any observed effects will be reversible.
While our studies using cord blood progenitors and the
phenotypes associated with loss of Mer function suggest
that Mer inhibition will be well-tolerated, there are no Mer
selective inhibitors that have been tested in vertebrates and
thus toxicity profiles have not been established.
Despite our finding that the majority of Merexpressing cell lines have at least some degree of
response to treatment with UNC1666 in apoptosis and
colony formation assays, the level of Mer protein does not
correlate with sensitivity to UNC1666. This observation
has recently led to initiation of studies to investigate the
characteristics of AML cells that might predict sensitivity
to Mer inhibition. Based on previous studies indicating
a prognostic role for Gas6 in AML, we hypothesize that
paracrine or autocrine expression of Gas6 (or other Mer
ligands) by the leukemia cell itself or by the supportive
marrow stroma [29, 33], could serve as a clinical
biomarker, however further investigation is needed.
In summary, Mer and Flt3 inhibition was effective at
profoundly diminishing survival of AML blasts in both cell
lines and primary patient samples. UNC1666 decreased
Mer and Flt3 phosphorylation/activation and abrogated
downstream signaling through the Stat, Akt and Erk
pathways. The dose required for these signaling effects
correlated well with induction of apoptosis and decreased
colony formation. Prolonged effects were even noted on
seemingly viable cell populations in replating assays, a
promising indication for future in vivo experimentation
with more bioavailable compounds that share UNC1666’s
improved potency. These data also suggest a potential role
for dual Mer/Flt3 inhibition in the treatment of human
AML, where there is a true need for targeted agents to
treat patients more effectively.
Interestingly, several additional cancers are known
to aberrantly express Mer, including acute lymphoblastic
leukemia and melanoma, and inhibition of Mer in these
cancers has demonstrated significant effects on malignant
cell survival and apoptosis [9, 34]. These malignancies
are also likely to benefit from the development of
newer generation Mer inhibitors with improved in vivo
bioavailability for use in the treatment of human disease,
though it is not clear if these cancers would equally benefit
from the dual Mer/Flt3 inhibition. The data presented here
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are likely to lead to a multitude of additional studies of
our Mer/Flt3 inhibitors exemplified here by UNC1666,
including evaluation of potential synergistic combination
therapy, assessment in murine xenograft mice using
patient derived xenografts, and ultimately to phase I
clinical trials. The hypothesis that Mer is providing
the neoplastic cell with a survival advantage and the
observation that Mer inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to
chemotherapy [9] suggest that combination with cytotoxic
therapy may be particularly efficacious, potentially
allowing for chemotherapy dose-reduction. In AML, the
dual Mer/Flt3 activity of this series of compounds should
provide additional efficacy relative to inhibition of either
kinase alone. Ultimately, the use of similar inhibitors
is anticipated to improve the treatment of AML, with
potential to decrease relapse rates and as a treatment
option for patients who are not able to tolerate the toxicity
of current standard chemotherapeutics.

METHODS
Compound development and kinase assays
UNC1666 and UNC1653 (a non-active analog)
were prepared as previously described [24, 30]. Kinase
inhibition profiling was performed by Carna Biosciences
to assess for off-target inhibition mediated by UNC1666.
Inhibition constants of Mer, Flt3, Tyro3 and Axl kinase
activity by UNC1666 was determined at the Km for ATP
using a microfluidic capillary electrophoresis (MCE) assay
[35–37] in which phosphorylated and unphosphorylated
substrate peptides were separated and analyzed using a
LabChip EZ Reader [23, 30]. See Supplemental Methods
for additional information. For in vitro studies, compounds
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma).
DMSO equivalent to the 300 nM UNC1666 treatment was
used as a vehicle control.

Patient samples and cell culture
Cell lines MV4;11, NOMO-1, KG-1a, NB-4,
and HEL were obtained from the German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Culture (DSMZ); Kasumi-1
and U937 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC); MOLM-13 was a gift from Robert
Arceci (Johns Hopkins); HS-27 was a gift from Kathrin
Bernt (University of Colorado). AML cell lines were
maintained in RPMI medium (HyClone) supplemented
with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (cRPMI).
Cell line identities were confirmed using short tandem
repeat microsatellite loci analysis. HS-27 stromal cells
were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and penicillin/
streptomycin prior to co-culture. De-identified cord blood
samples and primary patient myeloblasts apheresed from
peripheral blood were obtained from the University of
Colorado after written informed consent in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Experiments conformed
6733

to regulatory standards as approved by the Colorado
Multiple Institutional Review Board. AML patient samples
were maintained as previously described [38], with HS-27
stromal co-culture for apoptosis and cell cycle experiments.

(Beckman Coulter). For cell cycle analyses, cells were
fixed with 100% ethanol after treatment for 72 hours with
UNC1666 or controls, stained with PI overnight, and
analyzed on a Gallios flow cytometer. Flow cytometry
data were analyzed using Modfit Cell Cycle Analysis
software (Verity Software House). In replating assays,
cells were similarly plated and treated, then harvested cells
were washed twice, and 1.5 × 104 viable cells/ml were
cultured in cRPMI for six days. Six days after replating,
viable myeloblast count was determined by trypan blue
exclusion using a Cedex XS Analyzer (Roche).

Immunoblot analysis
Three million cells per condition were cultured in
24-well plates and treated with UNC1666, UNC1653, or
vehicle for two hours. Whole cell lysates were prepared
and proteins were resolved on Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE
gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were blocked in tris-buffered
saline with 0.1% Tween-20 containing 5% bovine serum
albumin (when probing for Flt3) or 5% milk (when
probing for all other molecules). For immunoprecipitation
assays, cells were plated and treated as above, then
treated with pervanadate for 10 minutes prior to cell lysis
to stabilize the phosphorylation status. With the use of
pervandate, it was not necessary to stimulate cells with
exogenous Mer or Flt3 ligands (other than from fetal
bovine serum) to detect phosphorylated Mer and Flt3
proteins. Anti-Mer antibody or anti-Flt3 and rec-Protein
G-sepharose beads (Invitrogen) were added and lysates
were incubated overnight on a rocking platform. Beads
were washed and eluted proteins were resolved as above.
Immunoprecipitate membranes were probed with an
anti-phospho-Mer or anti-phospho-Flt3 antibody. After
visualization, membranes were stripped and reprobed
for total protein. The following antibodies were used
according to manufacturer recommendations: anti-Mer
(ab52968, AbCam); anti-phospho-Mer (Phosphosolutions
Inc.) [34, 39]; anti-Flt3 (sc-480), anti-Actin (sc-1616),
anti-pan-Trk (sc-11), donkey-anti-goat IgG-HRP (sc2020) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-Flt3
(#3461), anti-phospho-Stat6 (Tyr641, #9364), anti-Stat6,
(#9362), anti-phospho-Stat5 (Tyr694, #9359), anti-Stat5
(#9358), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473, #9271L), anti-AKT
(#9272), anti-phospho-p44/42-MAPK (ERK1/2, Thr202/
Tyr204, #9106), anti-p44/42-MAPK (#9102), anti-PARP
(#9542), anti-Caspase-3 (#9665), anti-Tyro-3 (#5585)
(Cell Signaling Technology); anti-Axl (AF154, R&D
Systems); goat-anti-mouse IgG-HRP, goat-anti-rabbit IgGHRP (BioRad). Proteins were visualized by horseradish
peroxidase chemiluminescence detection (Perkin-Elmer).

Colony formation assays
Cell lines were plated at a density of 1000 cells/
ml in 0.35% agar over 0.5% agar base layer. Agar was
overlaid with cRPMI containing UNC1666, UNC1653, or
vehicle. Colonies were grown for 14 (NOMO-1, MV4;11,
MOLM-13) or 21 days (Kasumi-1) prior to staining
with 1 mg/ml nitrotetrazolium blue (Sigma-Aldrich).
Treatment-containing medium was renewed twice weekly.
Patient samples were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/
ml in MethoCult H4434 Classic Methylcellulose-Based
Medium with Recombinant Cytokines for Human Cells
(StemCell Technologies) containing UNC1666 or vehicle
in triplicate and colonies were grown for 10 days. Human
mononuclear cells were isolated from umbilical cord
blood samples using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences). Cells were grown in serum-free IMDM
(HyClone) media containing BIT 9500 Serum Substitute
(StemCell Technologies), lipoprotein lipase (Millipore),
and 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) for one hour, then plated
in Methocult H4434 methylcellulose containing UNC1666
or vehicle at 2 × 106 cells/mL in triplicate and colonies
were grown for 14 days. Cell line and patient sample
colonies were counted using a GelCount colony counter
(Oxford Optronix) and cord blood colonies were manually
counted in a blinded, non-biased manner.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism software (v6.02), comparing UNC1666 and vehicletreated samples. Cell cycle and replating assays were
analyzed using two-way ANOVA. All other data were
analyzed using one-way ANOVA. All statistics were
corrected using Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test.
Results were considered significant when p < 0.05.

Apoptosis & replating assays
To assess apoptosis, AML cell lines were cultured
at 3 × 105 cells, and 1 × 106 AML patient blasts were cocultured with 3.5 × 105 HS27 cells per condition in 24
well plates, and treated for 72 hours. Harvested cells
were washed, resuspended in PBS containing 1 μM
YO-PRO®-1 iodide (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μM propidium
iodide (PI) (Invitrogen), and incubated on ice for 15–20
minutes. Fluorescence was detected and analyzed using
a FC500 flow cytometer with CXP data analysis software
