Abstract
Invasion and proliferation in neoplasia require the cooperation of tumor cell and endothelial compartments.
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to signaling pathways that
modulate invasion and proliferation. Here we show that GSK-3 inhibitors of the indirubin family reduce invasion
of glioma cells and glioma-initiating cell-enriched neurospheres both in vitro and in vivo, and we show that
b-catenin signaling plays an important role in mediating these effects. Indirubins improved survival in gliomabearing mice in which a substantial decrease in blood vessel density was seen in treated animals. In addition,
indirubins blocked migration of endothelial cells, suggesting that anti-invasive glioma therapy with GSK-3
inhibitors in vivo not only inhibits invasion of tumor cells, but blocks migration of endothelial cells, which is also
required for tumor angiogenesis. Overall, our findings suggest that indirubin inhibition of GSK-3 offers a novel
treatment paradigm to target 2 of the most important interacting cellular compartments in heterotypic models
of cancer. Cancer Res; 71(16); 5374–80. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The formation of a cancerous mass requires contributions
not only by neoplastic cells, but also by the stroma, which
interact to cooperatively contribute to processes of tumorigenesis, such as proliferation and invasion/migration (1).
Glioblastoma is a heterogeneous tumor composed primarily
of tumor and endothelial cells, with some immune cells
including microglia (2, 3). Glioblastoma cells extensively
invade normal brain (4), which contributes to the continued
poor prognosis for these tumors by preventing complete
surgical resection. Invading tumor cells are resistant to conventional therapies (5) and invasiveness is enhanced by antiangiogenic approaches (6). Thus, an effective strategy to

prevent invasion of glioma cells into surrounding normal
brain is needed.
Recent studies have implicated glycogen synthase kinase-3
(GSK-3), a multifunctional serine-threonine protein kinase (7),
in the regulation of cell motility in many cell types including
astrocytes (8) and glioma cells in vitro (9). Two closely related
isoforms, GSK-3a and GSK-3b, function in multiple proliferation- and migration-associated pathways including Wnt,
Notch, growth factor, and G-protein–coupled receptor signaling. GSK-3 has many known substrates, including b-catenin,
which is targeted for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation as a result of phosphorylation by GSK-3 (10). Targeting
of GSK-3 for anti-invasive therapy has not yet been investigated in a relevant animal model of glioma. Here we show the
beneficial effects of GSK-3 inhibitors of the indirubin family
which act on both tumor cells blocking invasion and on
endothelial cells blocking angiogenesis, providing a novel
therapeutic paradigm for glioma treatment targeting tumor
invasion and angiogenesis simultaneously.

Indirubins Block Migration and Angiogenesis in Glioma

Cell culture
Glioma cell lines were from American Type Culture Collection, primary human glioma GBM9 cells were derived from a
human glioblastoma specimen and grown as tumor spheres
(9). X12 glioma cells passaged as s.c. xenografts in nude mice
were from Dr. C. David James (University of California, San
Francisco, CA; ref. 10).
Transfection and cell-based assays
b-Catenin siRNA HP5 (Qiagen) was transfected as described
(11). Spheroid and transwell assays were carried out as
described (11). b-catenin reporter plasmid pSuper8XTOPflash
or pSuper8XFOPflash (from Dr. Randall Moon, University of
Washington, Seattle, WA; ref. 12) was used as described (11).
In vivo studies
For flank tumors, 1  106 Gli36 cells were injected into the
rear flank of 5-week-old nude mice (National Cancer Institute). Twelve days later, vehicle [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/
PBS] or 6-bromoindirubin acetoxime (BIA; 1 mg/kg in DMSO/
PBS) was administered intraperitoneally every 2 days. Flank
growth was monitored every 2 days with calipers to estimate
tumor volume. Intracranial xenografts were done with X12,
U87-DEGFR (a gift from Webster Cavenee, University of
California, San Diego, CA), or GBM9-GFP cell lines. A total
of 100,000 viable cells were stereotactically injected 2 mm right
lateral, 1 mm frontal to the bregma (3 mm deep). On day 7,
post-tumor injection animals began a dosing regimen of either
vehicle (DMSO/PBS) or BIA (0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg) every
other day. For invasion studies, this dosing regimen was
started on day 2 after injection.
Tissue preparation
Brains were harvested and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 24 hours, then in 30% sucrose for 48 hours. Tissue was
embedded in Optimal Tissue Cutting Compound (OCT) and
sectioned at 20 mm. Sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin and rat anti-mouse CD31 (Pharmingen).
Sections were treated with 3% H2O2 in PBS for 10 minutes and
washed in PBS. Slides were then blocked with the Elite
Universal Vectastain ABC Blocking Kit (Vectorlabs) and treated with 10% normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton in PBS for 1
hour at room temperature, followed by Rat anti-CD31 (Pharmingen) diluted 1:20 in 0.5% Triton/PBS overnight at 4 C. The
next day, staining was visualized using biotinylated goat antimouse IgG, diluted 1:200 in 0.5% Triton in PBS, followed by
treatment with the Avidin–Biotin Blocking Kit (Vectorlabs).
Stain was developed with DAB and costained with Eosin-Y, for
1 to 2 minutes.
Image processing
Ten images were selected and 10 areas measured from rim
of tumor to furthest point migrated using ImageJ software.
Statistical analysis
Two sample t tests were used for all the continuous variables to compare experimental with control groups and
pairwise comparisons were adjusted (Bonferroni's method).

www.aacrjournals.org

Statistically significant differences (adjusted P < 0.05) are
marked with a single asterisk. Differences (adjusted P <
0.01) are marked with a double asterisk. For Fig. 4D an ANOVA
model was fit using cell number as the outcome and the
treatments as the independent variable. All treatments were
compared with the control and P -values adjusted for multiple
comparisons using Dunnet's method. For Kaplan–Meier
curves (survival analysis, Fig. 3D), the log-rank method was
used.

Results and Discussion
We found that indirubins, previously shown to be highly
potent GSK-3 inhibitors with low nanomolar in vitro IC50
values (13, 14), blocked glioma migration at low concentrations compared with other compounds (data not shown).
Indirubins were identified as the active component of the
Chinese medicine Dang Gui Long Hui Wan, which has activity
against leukemia (15). We examined 3 indirubin derivatives,
6-bromoindirubin-oxime (BIO), BIA, and indirubin 30 -oxime
(IO) in 3-dimensional (3-D) spheroid migration assays using
U87 glioma cells. A similar dose-dependent blockade of migration was observed for each drug, with complete inhibition at 5
mmol/L (Fig. 1A; 1 mmol/L BIO reduced migration to 58.1% vs.
vehicle control, P < 0.001; 5 mmol/L BIO–7.1% migration,
P < 0.001: 1 mmol/L BIA–63.2%, P ¼ 0.006, 5 mmol/L BIA–
4.9%, P < 0.001; 1 mmol/L IO–69.5%, P ¼ 0.09, 5 mmol/L IO–
6.3%, P < 0.001). This is approximately 10-fold lower than the
concentrations previously reported for other GSK-3 inhibitors
and 4,000-fold lower than LiCl (11). When drug was washed
from the spheres after 48 hours incubation, migration
resumed (Fig. 1B), indicating a specific blockade of migration
and not a general toxic effect. Migration of GBM9 glioblastoma-derived neurosphere-initiating cells was also blocked by
BIO (Fig. 1B), and experiments on U251 glioma cells in a
transwell assay showed a dose-dependent reduction in migration (Fig. 1C; 0.5 mmol/L BIO reduced migration to 48.7% vs.
vehicle control, P < 0.001, 2 mmol/L BIO–21.0%, P < 0.001;
0.5 mmol/L BIA–55.9%, P < 001, 2 mmol/L BIA–19.1%, P < 0.001;
0.5 mmol/L IO–48.6%, P < 0.001; 2 mm IO–11%, P < 0.001). 1Methyl-BIO (MeBIO), an indirubin derivative with negligible
GSK-3 inhibitory activity (IC50 ¼ 100 mmol/L), did not affect
migration (data not shown). The effects of indirubins occur at
lower concentrations than previously examined GSK-3 inhibitors and seem to be more pronounced, as seen in transwell
assays (Fig. 1D; 5 mmol/L LiCl–90% migration, P ¼ 0.216; 20
mmol/L LiCl–59%, P < 0.001).
The effects of indirubins on cell migration were specific—
only after 48 hours of treatment at high doses (10–50 mmol/L)
with BIO, BIA, or IO was there a significant reduction in cell
viability (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Cell proliferation with
5 mmol/L drug was not affected until 72 hours (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Treatment with MeBIO had no effect on cell viability
in the concentration range tested. This shows that indirubins
are relatively specific in their blockade of migration, which is
observed very rapidly at low concentrations, with effects on
cell viability observed only after prolonged exposure or at
higher drug concentrations.

was measured after 48 hours with each drug at the concentrations shown. Migration is expressed as sphere perimeter related to DMSO-treated controls.
B, spheroids pictured after treatment with BIO. Top: U87 spheroids after 48 hours in the spheroid assay. Control was treated with DMSO, BIO was used
at 5 mmol/L, and migration 48 hours after washout is shown (right). The bottom panel shows a similar experiment done with a glioma neurosphere line
(GBM9) in the presence of DMSO (control), BIO (5 mmol/L), or LiCl (20 mmol/L). Bar ¼ 500 mm. C, effects of indirubins on U251 glioma cell migration in the
transwell assay. Cells were treated with drugs at the concentrations indicated for 1 hour prior to transwell assays. Migration is shown relative to DMSO
or NaCl-treated controls. D, cell viability was measured over a range of indirubin concentrations in U251 glioma cells. Cells were treated with drugs for 48 hours
and viability measured with the Wst1 assay.

We used the TCF/LEF reporter plasmid TOPflash (12) as a
reporter of b-catenin transcriptional coactivation in response
to GSK-3 inhibition. This showed reporter activation after 24hour treatment with BIO in 3 glioblastoma lines (Fig. 2A).
GSK-3 inhibition with 20 mmol/L LiCl also led to an increase
in TOPflash activity, but this was approximately 6-fold lower
than with BIO (U87 cells–BIO RLU 6.0-fold higher than LiCl;
U251 cells; GBM9 cells–7.9-fold. Adjusted P < 0.001 for each
condition).
We observed a blockade of b-catenin phosphorylation after
24-hour treatment with either BIO (5 mmol/L) or LiCl (20
mmol/L). However, a reduction of the tyr216 phosphorylation
of GSK-3b was only seen after BIO treatment, in contrast with
LiCl (Fig. 2B). BIO also caused a rapid (1 hour) translocation of
b-catenin (Fig. 2C), which was not seen with LiCl. These data
suggest that BIO leads to more robust GSK-3 inactivation than
LiCl.
b-catenin is not well studied in glioma: we therefore examined the effects of b-catenin knockdown on glioma cell
migration. This led to almost a doubling of the migration
of U251 in transwell assays compared with controls (P ¼ 0.003;
Fig. 2D), suggesting that GSK-3 activation promotes glioma
migration through phosphorylation and downregulation of
b-catenin. Knockdown of b-catenin led to a partial rescue of
the antimigratory effects of BIO increasing migration 3-fold
(P ¼ 0.031). This suggests that GSK-3 inhibition and resulting

5376

b-catenin stabilization plays a role in the inhibition of migration by BIO. Conversely, glioma migration was reduced 50% by
overexpression of mutated b-catenin, with its GSK-3 phosphorylation sites abolished (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 2D). Further
support for a role for b-catenin in glioma migration was
provided by studies which showed a large reduction in
cell–cell adhesion after siRNA knockdown (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Finally, we analyzed b-catenin phosphorylation over
a time course in a 3-D spheroid migration assay. This showed
that over the course of the assay, b-catenin phosphorylation
by GSK-3 increased (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Taken together,
these data support a role for GSK-3 in glioma migration
through regulation of b-catenin.
To determine whether indirubins could affect glioma invasion in vivo, we examined intracranial xenografts of an invasive human glioma–derived neurosphere line (GBM9) in
athymic mice. Animals were sacrificed at day 14 after tumor
implantation with or without BIA treatment. Reduced levels of
invasion could be seen in treated animals in terms of diffuse
migration. Strikingly, migration into the contralateral hemisphere was not observed in treated animals, and only single
tumor foci were seen. A representative image of this effect is
shown in Fig. 3A. Quantitation of invasion across multiple
sections of several animals revealed a significant reduction
in migration of approximately 40% compared with controls
(P < 0.001; Fig. 3B).

Most strikingly, increased animal survival was observed in
intracranial models of 3 different glioma cell lines; U87DEGFR,

To further analyze the role of BIA in increased animal
survival tumor volume was examined. This revealed a potential reduction in average tumor volume, although this did not
reach significance (P ¼ 0.156). Also, there was no significant
reduction in mitotic index in treated tumors. However, examination of Gli36 glioma cells grown as flank tumors showed a
significant 5-fold reduction in tumor size in BIA-treated
animals compared with controls at day 22 after tumor implantation (P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3D). The occurrence of a clear anti-

proliferative effect in flank tumors may reflect the increased
availability of BIA to the tumor cells compared with those
grown in the brain, and the potential direct effects on tumor
cells merit further study. We noticed that untreated tumors
were much darker and more hemorrhagic than those treated
with BIA (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S3A). This strongly
suggested alterations in blood flow after drug treatment. We
therefore stained tumors using the endothelial marker CD31 to
identify blood vessels. This revealed a significant alteration in
blood vessel density and structure in treated tumors (Fig. 4A).
Vessels were shorter both intratumorally and peritumorally;
however, there was no significant change in their length in the
contralateral hemisphere (intratumoral–69% vessel length

Also, CD31 showed diffuse staining in controls that was not
observed in treated animals, likely as a result of increased vessel
leakiness. A significant reduction in angiogenesis was observed
in all tumor models tested (Gli36 flank–2.3-fold reduction, P ¼

capacity to reduce angiogenesis through its effects on endothelial cell migration. This shows that indirubin-related compounds simultaneously block 2 major hallmarks of
glioblastoma—angiogenesis and invasion—through effects
on cell migration.
The invasive nature of gliomas is a major barrier to their
effective clinical treatment. In fact, the recent FDA approval of
bevacizumab has led to a clinical reduction of glioblastoma
angiogenesis and observed tumor volumes, yet therapeutic

failures are common potentially because of increased migration of treated tumor cells into the brain (6). Our data show
that indirubins are far more potent in blocking migration than
inhibitors previously examined (11) and that this inhibition
functions to improve animal survival by acting on both the
glioma and endothelial cell compartment.
A reversible inhibition of migration in spheroid assays was
observed at 5 mmol/L indirubin, compared with our previous
study (11) which showed 20 mmol/L for LiCl, AR-A014418 (50
mmol/L), and SB415286 (25 mmol/L). These values reflect the
respective IC50 value of each compound for in vitro GSK-3
inhibition (indirubins–10–22 nmol/L; LiCl–2 mmol/L; ARA014418–104 nmol/L; SB415286–78 nmol/L; ref. 13). Indirubins were more potent than LiCl in transwell assays and in
b-catenin coactivation. The reasons for this may reflect the
kinetics of drug import/export, stability, and their ability to
inhibit GSK-3.
GSK-3 is known to play a role in migration of several cell
types, by a range of mechanisms including Rac1 activation
(16), microtubule activity (17), and focal adhesion dynamics

(18). Here we show for the first time that b-catenin plays a role
in mediating effects of GSK-3 on glioma cell motility. This
conclusion is based on several lines of evidence: (i) a substantial increase in b-catenin promoter activity and cellular
localization after BIO treatment; (ii) b-catenin phosphorylation is blocked by BIO treatment; (iii) siRNA mediated b-catenin knockdown increases migration and partially rescues the
effects of BIA, whereas phospho-mutated b-catenin decreases
glioma cell migration; (iv) b-catenin knockdown leads to a
reduction in cell–cell adhesion; and (v) b-catenin phosphorylation increases during a glioma cell migration assay.
Although well studied in other tumor types, relatively little
is known of the role of b-catenin in glioma (19). Studies have
shown that modulation of cell–cell contacts affects cell motility in glioma cells (20). It was also recently shown that the
dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP26 regulates KIF3-dependent transport of b-catenin and N-cadherin complexes to the
cell periphery promoting cell–cell adhesion (21). Our data
suggest that altered b-catenin regulation is at least one of the
mechanisms by which GSK-3 inhibition affects glioma cell

motility, although, given the multifunctional nature of GSK-3,
it is likely that other mechanisms also contribute.
The use of orthotopic xenograft models revealed that
intraperitoneal administration of BIA leads to an increase
in animal survival in 3 separate intracranial glioma models.
Reduced invasion of glioma cells was observed in the gliomainitiating cell line GBM9. The observation of a striking reduction in hemorrhage in excised brains and tumor sections from
treated animals prompted us to examine tumor-associated
blood vessels which were significantly reduced in number
after treatment with BIA. We then found that indirubins could
inhibit endothelial migration, which suggest that treated
animals have reduced vasculature and tumor invasion
because of antimigratory effects of the drug on both tumor
and endothelial cells. Interestingly, 2 recent studies suggested
GSK-3 as a target in glioblastoma because of reduced proliferation observed with GSK-3 inhibitors (22, 23). However,
angiogenesis was not examined in these studies. It is also a
possibility that indirubins may have direct effects on tumor
cell proliferation. We showed in vitro that this occurs at higher
drug concentrations than are necessary for maximal blockade
of migration and with prolonged incubation (Supplementary

Fig. S1). On the basis of our observations, it is most likely that
the increase in animal survival observed with BIA treatment is
based on a combination of effects on cell motility, which limits
tumor spread, and effects on tumor-associated blood vessels,
which limits blood supply, and reduces vessel leakiness.
Detailed studies of molecular alterations in treated tumors
will be carried out to further address these questions. Thus,
indirubins are candidates from which to build a combined
antiangiogenic and anti-invasive approach for glioma treatment by acting on both tumor and endothelial compartments.
