ABSTRACT
Host defense peptides (HDPs) are naturally occurring molecules found in most
species, in which they play a significant role in the first line defense against intruding
pathogens, and several HDPs have been shown to possess anticancer activity.
Structure-activity relationship studies on the HDP bovine lactoferricin revealed
a de novo design of a nonamer peptide LTX-315, with oncolytic properties.
In the present study, we investigated the oncolytic activity of LTX-315 in human
melanoma cells (A375). LTX-315 induced a rapid plasma membrane disruption and
cell death within 2 hours. At a low concentration, fluorescence-labeled LTX-315
was internalized and accumulated in cytoplasmic vacuoles in close proximity to the
mitochondria. The mitochondrial membrane potential was shown to depolarize as
a consequence of LTX-315 treatment and at ultrastructural level, the mitochondria
morphology was significantly altered. Release of danger signals (DAMPs) such as
ATP, Cytochrome C and HMGB1 into the cell supernatant of cultured cells was evident
minutes after peptide treatment.
The oncolytic effect of LTX-315 involving perturbation of both the cell membrane
and the mitochondria with subsequent release of DAMPs may highlight the ability of
LTX-315 to induce complete regression and long-term protective immune responses
as previously reported in experimental animal models.

to rapidly induce necrosis in murine cancer cells [13].
Interestingly, LTX-302 treatment also induced a complete
regression and subsequent protection against re-challenge
in an experimental animal model by inducing an adaptive
immune response [13]. We have recently reported
anticancer effects of the nonamer LTX-315 (Figure 1) [14,
15], which is considerably shorter than the model peptide
LfcinB (25aa). LTX-315 has the ability to adopt a α-helical
secondary structure and contains five cationic Lys
residues, three Trp residues, the bulky non-coded residue
β-diphenylalanine (Dip) and an amidated C-terminal. This
peptide has been shown to rapidly induce necrosis and
anticancer immune responses after intratumoral treatment
in an experimental murine melanoma model [14, 15].
Given the strong immunomodulatory effect of LTX-315
observed in vivo, we wanted to investigate the mechanisms
of action of LTX-315 in human melanoma cells in vitro.

INTRODUCTION
Host defense peptides (HDPs) represent a diverse
group of peptides found in virtually all species of life as a
part of the innate immune system [1, 2]. In addition to the
bactericidal effects, many HDPs have been shown to have
antitumor [3] and antiviral [4] activity, and contribute to
both innate and adaptive immunity [5, 6]. The host defense
peptide lactoferricin (LfcinB) is a cyclic 25-amino acid
peptide widely investigated for both its antimicrobial
properties, as well as for antitumor effect, in vitro and
in vivo [7–9]. Based on extensive structure-activity studies
performed on LfcinB, we have identified several structural
parameters critical to its anti-tumor activity and selectivity
[10–12]. With an optimization of these parameters, a new
group of shorter and more potent anticancer peptides has
been designed. One of these, LTX-302, was reported

RESULTS

cell imaging with confocal microscopy demonstrated that
treatment LTX-315 for 5 minutes was sufficient to induce
loss of plasma integrity in a majority of cells at both 4°C and
37°C (Figure 4 A–4D). Hence, the membranolytic activity
by LTX-315 is not dependent on endocytosis or other types
of active transportation mechanism.

Cytotoxic effect of LTX-315 on melanoma cells
The cytotoxic activity of LTX-315 on A375 melanoma
cells was investigated at different time points. The IC50
values determined at each time point show that LTX-315
killed the cancer cells within minutes. (Figure 2)
The IC50 value for LTX-315 was 30 μM after only five
minutes of exposure and lowered to 17 μM after 60 minutes.

LTX-315 internalizes and targets the
mitochondria
To investigate if LTX-315 is internalized and has
any intracellular targets, A375 cells were incubated with
Pacific Blue-labeled LTX-315. The labeled LTX-315
rapidly penetrated the plasma membrane and showed
an accumulation close to the mitochondria after 30
minutes of incubation without being detected in the cell
nucleus (Figure 5). The labeled non-lytic mock-sequence
peptide LTX-328 did not demonstrate any internalization
at any concentration or incubation time tested
(Figure 6B). LTX-315 treated A375 cells also showed
a decreased signal from the mitochondrial membrane
potential sensitive dye Mitotracker. (Figure 7), indicating
that LTX-315 interacts with the mitochondria membrane.

LTX-315 treatment causes rapid cell lysis
We next wanted to assess the cell morphology of
A375 melanoma cells after being treated with LTX-315.
Cells were treated in a time dependent manner with LTX315 (17 μM) and investigated by bright field confocal
microscopy. Treated cells displayed a rapid change from
a normal epithelial morphology to a total collapse of the
cells with an extrusion of cytoplasmic content, which
was proceeded by a rounding up of the cell (Figure 3).
These changes occurred in the majority of cells within
15–60 minutes of treatment with LTX-315. A time-lapse
movie showing the morphological changes in treated
cells is enclosed in the supplementary section.

LTX-315 induces ultra-structural changes in
cells

LTX-315 rapidly induced loss of plasma
membrane integrity

We further evaluated the ultra-structural changes
in A375 cells after LTX-315 treatment by performing
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A significant
number of the cells treated with a low concentration of
the LTX-315 peptide (3,5 μM) for 60 minutes showed
vacuolization, as well as altering of the mitochondrial
morphology (Figure 8B). The mitochondria appeared
to be less electron-dense, also exhibiting some degree
of reorganization, with the cristae lying further apart
or not visible at all. This in contrast to electron dense,

To further investigate the membranolytic activity
of LTX-315, treated cells were labeled with the DNA
binding fluorescent probe PI. This dye is commonly used to
distinguish between live and necrotic cells in various assays
as it only enters cells with a compromised plasma membrane.
To elucidate if the initial membranolytic effect was
dependent on internalization of the peptide we conducted the
following experiments at 4°C and 37°C respectively. Live

(Figure 8A and 8D) The number of necrotic cells in
these samples was less than 5%. Moreover, perinuclear
vacuoles were also observed at low concentration of LTX315, with a content consisting of cytosolic material such
as ribosomes and other organelles (Figure 8E). Another
common finding in these samples were peripherally placed
vacuoles, which were lined with a single membrane layer
containing a homogenous material (Figure 8B). When
cells were treated with a higher concentration (17 μM) for
60 min, approximately 40% of them displayed a necrotic
morphology with a loss of plasma membrane integrity
(Figure 8C). The cells that were still intact displayed a
great heterogeneity, from a normal appearance with
microvilli to a round appearance, with mitochondria
clearly affected. At this high concentration, only 4%
of the cells investigated displayed vacuolization, and
chromatin condensation was not visible in the cells at any
peptide concentration tested. These results demonstrate
that LTX-315 kills the tumor cells with a lytic mode
of action, while lower concentrations cause the cells to
undergo ultrastructure changes, such as vacuolization

and an altered mitochondrial morphology. No significant
morphological changes suggestive of apoptotic cell death
were observed.

LTX-315 treatment leads to extracellular ATP
release
Danger-associated molecular pattern molecules
(DAMPs) are molecules that are released from intracellular
sources during cellular damage. DAMPs can initiate and
perpetuate an immune response through binding to Pattern
Recognition Receptors (PRRs) on Antigen Presenting
Cells (APCs). Among commonly known DAMPs are
ATP, HMGB1, Calreticulin, Cytochrome C, mitochondrial
DNA and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) [18–20]. We
investigated release of several DAMPs including the level
of ATP released into the supernatant from cells treated
with LTX-315. (35 μM) The supernatant from treated and
non-treated cells was diluted at 1:10 and analyzed using
luciferase detection assay. As shown in Figure 9, ATP was
detected in the supernatant as early as after 5 minutes of
treatment with LTX-315.

The increase in cytochrome-C was detected already at
five minutes of exposure with LTX-315. (Figure 10).

LTX-315 treatment leads to extracellular
HMGB1 release

increase in translocation of HMGB1 from the cell lysate
to the supernatant was detected in the LTX-315-treated
melanoma cells, but not in the supernatants of cells treated
with the mock sequence peptide LTX-328 or a serum-free
medium only (Figure 11).

When the nuclear protein HMBG1 is released into
the extracellular fluid, it functions as a DAMP, and can
bind to both the PRR TLRs and to the RAGE receptors;
whose activation leads to a number of inflammatory
responses such as activation and maturation of antigen
presenting cells (APCs). In order to assess the release of
HMGB1 from LTX-315-treated cells, we measured the
translocation of HMGB1 from the nuclear compartment
into the culture supernatant [18]

immune responses developed by another short oncolytic
peptide involved both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (13).
Taken together these findings demonstrates that oncolytic
peptides have an ability to stimulate strong T-cell
dependent protective cancer specific responses. In this
article, we investigate the mode of action of the oncolytic
peptide, LTX-315 in more detail in vitro. In vitro studies
demonstrated that LTX-315-induced cell death in A375
melanoma cells takes place within minutes after treatment.
(Figure 2). This stands in contrast to conventional
cytostatic drugs, which target the cell’s DNA or mitotic
apparatus, killing dividing cells in a matter of several
hours or days [46, 47]. In general, HDPs are known to kill
cancer cells by either plasma membrane attack via pore
formation or through membrane destabilization, as well
as by the induction of programmed cell death, independent
of proliferative status or drug-resistant phenotype [3].
The ability to induce loss of plasma membrane integrity
by penetration or destabilization is a common feature
within the diverse classes of HDP [2, 3, 34, 48], and
LTX-315 proved to share this feature as demonstrated
with PI studies performed with confocal microscopy.
Cells treated with 35 μM LTX-315 were PI positive after
5 min, demonstrating a rapid effect against the plasma
membrane (Figure 4). To determine if the process of
plasma membrane disruption was temperature dependent,
parallel experiments at both 4oC and 37oC were performed.
We observed that LTX-315 was able to disintegrate the
plasma membrane at low temperature, pointing toward a
direct interaction with the plasma membrane (Figure 4).
Confocal and electron microscopy imaging of LTX-315treated cells supported a direct membrane effect since a
majority of the cells treated with a high concentration of
LTX-315 (17 μM) was killed by a membranolytic mode of
action (Figures 3, 4). The parental peptide LfcinB has been
proven to internalize and cause cell death by targeting the
mitochondria, resulting in both caspase-dependent and
caspase independent cell death [8, 9, 49]. These findings,
together with the knowledge that the mitochondria are the
most negatively charged organelle in the cytoplasm and
would therefore likely attract any internalized cationiccharged molecule, led us to investigate whether LTX-315
was internalized and targeted to the mitochondria. Indeed,
by labeling with the fluorescent molecule Pacific Blue,
LTX-315 was shown to be internalized and distributed in
the cytoplasm. At low concentrations, accumulation of the
peptide in close proximity to the mitochondria was evident,
whereas at higher concentrations the peptide was more
even distributed within the cytoplasm and accumulated in
circular structures both in association to the mitochondria
but also closer to the cell membrane (Figure 6A). The
fluorescence labeled mock sequence peptide LTX-328 was
not detected intracellularly, proving that internalization is
specific for LTX-315 and not caused by the fluorescent tag.
A confocal imaging of the melanoma cells labeled with
the membrane potential-dependent mitochondrial stain

treatment was measured by CH2DCFDA fluorometric
assay. An increase in ROS production was generated after
15 minutes of incubation with LTX-315. (Figure 12).

DISCUSSION
Recent advances in immunotherapy treatment of
metastatic melanoma has gained much attention lately [24].
Especially the overwhelming and lasting clinical response
in some patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade,
has been the source of growing optimism and interest in
the field of cancer immunotherapy [25, 26]. However,
the response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma
treated with these new drugs are typically below 40% and
a significant number of patients experience serious adverse
effects. [27, 28] More insight into beneficial combinations
of existing treatments are called for, as well as biomarkers
for successful patient selections. [29–31] There is also
interest in new approaches within cancer immunotherapy.
Host defense peptides (HDPs) are a part of the innate
immune system [1]. There is a wide range of structural
diversity between different HDPs, but common features
are cationicity, amphipatic conformation, and an ability
to interact with cellular membranes [1, 32]. Some HDPs
and de novo designed peptides have been shown to exhibit
anticancer activities in a number of experimental studies
[3, 33– 35], and the most commonly described mode
of action is a direct membranolytic effect [36]. Several
studies of cancer cells from different cancers demonstrate
that the plasma membrane of malignantly transformed
cells are different from their normal counterparts with
regard to overall electrical charge, membrane fluidity
and cell surface area. These changes makes cancer cells
more vulnerable and allows for a more selective killing of
cancer cells as compared to normal cells. Cancer cells are
known to be more negatively charged than the membranes
of their normal counterpart cells, due to a higher amount
of anionic components in the plasma membrane such
as phosphatidylserine [37–39], proteoglycans with
heparin sulphate [40–42] and sialic acid on glycoproteins
(e.g. mucins) [43–45]. These changes may cause cancer
cells to be vulnerable and allows for a more selective
killing of cancer cells by cationic peptides as compared
to normal cells. The naturally occurring peptide LfcinB
has served as a model peptide for a new group of shorter
oncolytic peptides [13].
Intratumoral treatment with one of these peptides,
LTX-315, was shown to induce tumor necrosis and longlasting regression in in the majority (80%) of animals
in a murine B16 melanoma model [15]. Histological
investigations of treated tumors revealed extensive
hemorrhagic necrosis and infiltration of CD3+ T cells.
Moreover, mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines such
as IL1β, IL6 and IL18 were found to be augmented in
the tumor tissue after LTX-315 treatment. The treatment
did also prevent lung metastasis in mice re-challenged
with B16F1 cells intravenously [15]. Tumor protective

signal 60 minutes after peptide treatment (Figure 7),
indicating that the peptide targets the mitochondria
membrane and causes a loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential. Cell morphology studies (TEM) showed
significant alternations in the mitochondria morphology
after LTX-315 treatment. Treated cells demonstrated
less electron-dense mitochondria with a distortion of the
cristae organization, as well as vacuolization within the
mitochondria as compared to mitochondria of untreated
cells (Figure 8 A–8C). Furthermore, vacuolization within
the cytoplasm was evident in approximately 20% of cells
treated with 3,5 μM of LTX-315. Hence, these findings
reveal that the de novo generated LTX-315 peptide is
internalized and disintegrate the mitochondria.
When the mitochondria are dysfunctional, free
oxygen radicals (ROS) may be formed [21]. An increased
ROS formation was detected within a few minutes after
LTX-315 treatment (Figure 12). However, the fluorometric
assay used is not specific for mitochondrial ROS and may
measure other intracellular sources of ROS such as ER
and peroxisomes [50]. Independent of intracellular source
an increase in ROS may lead to cell death [51, 52] through
oxidation of lipids and proteins, as well as DNA damage and
mitochondrial dysfunction [53]. ROS levels have also been
linked to cell death by autophagy, a self-catabolic process in
which the cell engulfs and destroys its own organelles via
lysosomal proteinase-regulated elimination [53].
DAMPs (Death Associate Molecular Pattern) are
naturally expressed molecules that signal tissue damage
to the host. These molecules may be secreted by activated
macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells or mature dendritic
cells (DC) in response to inflammatory stimuli such
as infection or tissue injury, or are released into the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

extracellular compartment by distressed or necrotic cells
[54]. DAMPs exert strong stimulatory effect on immune
cells. There are a high number of recognized and suggested
DAMPs such as High Motility Group Box 1 proteins
(HMGB1), Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) [55–59] and
mitochondrial proteins such as Cytochrome-C and also
ROS generated by damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria
[60, 61]. DAMPs can bind to Pattern Recognition
Receptors (PRRs) on the cell surface or in the cytosol,
thus leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine production
and the activation of antigen presenting cells [62]. The
mitochondria are important mediators of inflammation
[60, 61, 63, 64] and a source of DAMPs [22, 63, 65, 66].
Since LTX-315 treatment affects the mitochondria, its
ability to induce release of certain mitochondrial derived
DAMPs such as ATP and Cytochrome-C was investigated.
Increased levels of Cytochrome-C were detected
in the supernatant of LTX-315 treated cell cultures
(Figure  10). Cytochrome-C is a mitochondrial protein
released from the intermembrane space and into the
cytosol when the outer mitochondrial membrane is
perturbed. By binding to the apoptotic protease activating
factor-1 (Apaf-1) it is also a part of the apoptotic cascade
that eventually leads to cell death by apoptosis. However,
when cytochrome-C is present in the extracellular space,
it has been reported to act as a pro-inflammatory mediator,
thus activating NF-kB and inducing cytokine and
chemokine production [67]. We also detected increased
levels of ATP in the supernatant of LTX-315 treated
cells (Figure 9). When ATP is released extracellularly it
functions as a DAMP by activating the purinergic P2RX7
receptors on dendritic cells (DC) [55]. This receptor not
only functions as a pore that opens for small cationic and
34918

later larger molecules after binding to ATP, its activation
also causes the processing and release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β [68, 69].
High-Mobility-Group-Box-1 (HMGB1) is a
non-histone, chromatin-binding nuclear protein. Once
passively released from necrotic cells, HMGB1 is able
to trigger the functional maturation of dendritic cells,
cytokine stimulation and chemotaxis among several
immunopotentiating effects. HMGB1 is normally present
in the cell nucleus and would be expected in a cell lysate
of untreated cells, and not in the culture supernatant.
[22, 56, 70, 71]. Western blot analysis of treated A375
cultures showed a translocation of HMGB1 from the
cellular compartment to the supernatant (Figure 11), thus
revealing that LTX-315 treatment can cause release of
non-mitochondrial DAMPs.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that LTX-315
induces lytic cell death in cancer cells, not only by directly
attacking the plasma membrane, but also as a result of
an injury to vital intracellular organelles, particularly
mitochondria, after the internalization of the peptide at
concentrations too low to cause an immediate loss of
plasma membrane integrity. We demonstrate that the
peptide treatment causes the release of several DAMPs
such as cytochrome-C, ATP, HMGB1. The DAMPs may
affect the cellular integrity of the damaged cells in several
ways, but are also associated with hallmarks of so-called
immunogenic cell death [72–74]. The excessive release of
DAMPs may help explain the strong effect of LTX-315
obtained in experimental animal tumor models, which have
not only demonstrated a primary tumor regression and
lymphocyte infiltration, but also protective and systemic
immune response upon re-challenge with the same tumor
[14, 15]. The overall strong therapeutic effect may be due
to the release of tumor-specific antigens released into the
extracellular compartment, together with potent immune
stimulatory molecules (DAMPS) such as ATP, cytochrome-C
and HMGB1. In turn, these will lead to a maturation and
activation of DCs and other accessory cells of the adaptive
immune system. Our data unveil the oncolytic effect of
LTX-315, involving perturbation of both the cell membrane
and the mitochondria, with subsequent release of DAMPs,
which highlight the ability of LTX-315 to induce complete
regression and long-term protective immune responses.
LTX-315 has a potential as a novel immunotherapeutic agent
and is currently tested in clinical phase I as a first in class
oncolytic peptide immunotherapy.

Cell culture
The A375 cell line A375 (ECACC, 88113005)
is a human malignant melanoma derived from patient
material, and was purchased from Public Health England
(PHE Culture Collections, Porton Down, Salisbury,
UK). Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in
high glucose 4.5% DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
and 1% L-glutamine, but not as antibiotics (complete
medium). The cell line was grown in a humidified 5%
CO2 atmosphere at 37°C, and was regularly tested for the
presence of mycoplasma with MycoAlert (Lonza).

In vitro cytotoxicity
The cytotoxic effect of LTX-315 was investigated
using the colorimetric MTT viability assay [8, 16, 17]. The
A375 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/
ml in a volume of 0.1 ml in 96-well plates, and allowed to
adhere in a complete growth medium overnight. The media
was then removed and the cells were washed twice in
serum-free, RPMI-1654 medium, before adding LTX-315
dissolved in serum-free RPMI at concentrations ranging
from 2-180 μm/ml, and incubated for 5–180 minutes. Cells
added serum-free RPMI were used as negative control
cells, while cells treated with 1% Triton X-100 in serumfree medium were used as a positive control. The results
were calculated using the mean of three experiments, each
with triplicate wells.

Fluorescence measurement of reactive oxygen
species (ROS)

Live cell- propidium iodide – A375 cells were
seeded at 10,000 cells/well in a complete medium in
Nunc Lab-Tec 8-wells chambered covered glass (Sigma)
and allowed to adhere 48 hours. Cells were washed
twice with a serum-free RPMI, treated with 35 μM LTX315, propidium iodide (PI) (sigma) and Hoechst33342
dissolved in RPMI. Incubation time was 5 minutes and
was performed in regular incubation condition or on ice.
The media was subsequently replaced with serum free
RPMI before immediate analyzation using a Zeiss
confocal microscope equipped with an incubation chamber
with CO2 and temperature control.
Fixed
cells,
fluorescence-labeled
peptide - Subconfluent A375 cells were seeded at 8,000
cells/well as above, and transfected the second day using
the Lipofectamine LTX with Plus transfection reagents
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The
mitochondria were labeled using the pDsRed2-Mito, and
the nucleus was labeled using the GFP-Histon2B plasmid
(a kind gift from the Imaging Platform, University of
Tromsø). A day after transfection, cells were washed
twice with serum-free RPMI, and treated at different
concentration and incubation periods with LTX-315
Pacific Blue or LTX-328 Pacific Blue. LTX-315 PB
exhibited a similar cytotoxic profile as the unlabeled
LTX-315 as determined by MTT assay. Control cells were
treated with unlabeled LTX-315 and also with serumfree
RPMI only. After incubation, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS, and the wells were covered
with Prolong Gold antifade (Invitrogen). Cells were further
analyzed by use of a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope,
with a 693, 1.2 W objective. Pacific Blue, GFP and Ds
Red were excited using UV, with 488 and 561 lasers,
and fluorescence channels were sequentially detected
using the following band passes: UV: 420–480 nm (with
attenuation), 488: 501–550 nm and 561: 576–676 nm.

A DCFDA cellular reactive oxygen species
detection assay kit was purchased from Abcam® (UK),
and A375 cells seeded in a 96-well Costar black clear
bottom plate with 20,000 cells per well incubated in
37°C 16 hours prior to DCFDA assay. Cells were washed
with a 100 μL/well of pre-warmed PBS one time, and
incubated with 20 μM of DCFDA in a buffer solution
supplied with the kit at 37°C in a cell culture incubator
for 45 min, and then washed again with a buffer solution
of 100 μL/well. The cells were subsequently incubated
with a 100 μL/well LTX-315 peptide dissolved in HBSS
buffer solution at concentrations of 17 μM for 30 min,
and untreated cells were used as a negative control. The
fluorescence intensity was determined at an excitation
wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of
530 nm on a FLUOstar Galaxy plate reader.

Release of high mobility-group box-1 (HMGB1)
A375 cells were seeded with 3 × 10 5cells/well in
6-well plates in complete medium, and allowed to adhere
overnight. Cells were treated with LTX-315 or LTX-328
at 35 μM, and incubated at 37oC and 5% CO2 for different
time points (5, 10, 15, 30, 60 min), and negative controls
were serum-free RPMI-1650. Supernatants (S) were
collected and centrifuged at 1,400 g for five minutes,
and cell lysates (L) were harvested after washing with
PBS twice and thereafter lysed using a 4X Sample
buffer (Invitrogen), 0.1M DTT (Sigma) and water.
Supernatants were concentrated using Amicon Ultra
50 K centrifugal filters (Millipore UFC505024), and the
cell lysate was sonicated. Both supernatants and lysate
were boiled and resolved by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then
electro transferred to a polyvindiline difluoride (PVDF)
membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked in 5%
skimmed milk and incubated with the HMGB1 antibody
(rabbit, polyclonal, Abcam ab 18256); the membrane
was then rinsed several times with TBST, incubated with
a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibody (Abcam ab6721), rinsed again with TBST and
finally developed using WB Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany).

TEM electron microscopy
A375 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in
6-well plates and allowed to grow for three days to optimize
membrane structures in the culture, and the medium was
changed on the second day. Cells were washed twice in
serum-free RPMI before being treated with LTX-315
dissolved in serum-free RPMI at 3.5 and 17 μM, with serumfree RPMI as a negative control. Cells were then washed
with PBS before fixation for 24 hours at 4°C with 4%
formal aldehyde and 1% gluteralaldehyde in a Hepes buffer
at pH 7.8. Dehydration and post-fixation protocols included
incubation in a 5% buffered tannic acid and incubation in
1% osmium-reduced ferrocyanide. Ultrathin sections were
prepared, and uranyl acetate (5%) and Reynolds’s lead
citrate were used for staining and contrasting. Samples
were examined on a JEOL JEM-1010 transmission
electron microscope, and images were taken with an
Olympus Morada side-mounted TEM CCD camera
(Olympus soft imaging solutions, GmbH, Germany).

Release of cytochrome-C
A375 cells were seeded as in HMGB1 studies,
and treated with 35 μM LTX-315 for different time
points (5, 15, 45 min). Supernatants were collected and
concentrated as with HMGB1 studies, and samples from
the supernatants were analyzed using a 4.5-hour solid
form Cytochrome C- Elisa kit (R&D Systems, USA,
#DCTC0) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Shortly thereafter, a 50% diluted sample was analyzed

and the optical density was determined using a microplate
reader set at 450 nm. This reading was then subtracted
from the reading at 540 nm. A standard curve was
generated for each set of samples assayed. Samples were
run in four parallels, and the cytochrome-C released into
the supernatant was expressed as a fold over the level of
cytochrome-C in the supernatant of untreated cells.

Release of ATP
The supernatant of LTX-315-treated A375 cells
was analyzed using an Enliten ATP luciferase assay kit
(Promega, USA). Cells were seeded as described for ROS
assay, and treated with LTX-315 (35 μM) for 1–15 minutes;
each experiment was performed with two parallels and
conducted three times. Negative controls were untreated
A375 cells exposed to serum-free medium alone. Samples
diluted 1:10 were analyzed with a Luminoscan RT
luminometer according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
