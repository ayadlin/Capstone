BACKGROUND. Because few large studies of pediatric ependymoma treatment are
available, the authors believed that a retrospective review of treatment outcomes
from a single institution would yield potentially valuable information regarding
potential prognostic factors. In this article, they report their 20-year institutional
experience with this disease.
METHODS. Medical records were reviews of patients with intracranial ependymoma who received their initial treatment at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)/Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) between January
1980 and December 2000. Of the 61 patients who were identified, 49 patients
underwent primary therapy at CHOP/HUP and formed the basis for the study.
Actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were deter-

RESULTS. With median follow-up of 110.2 months, the 5-year OS and PFS rates
cantly predicted for improved OS. Anaplastic histology predicted for decreased
failures outside the primary site. Patients who had a favorable prognosis (aged
3 years, no dissemination or cord extension, complete resection, and radiation
dose 54 grays [Gy]) had 5-year OS and PFS rates of 83.1% and 60.6%, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. In this study of patients with pediatric intracranial ependymoma,
OS and PFS rates were concordant with the rates published in other modern series. The finding of a dose response up to 54 Gy supported the current trend toward dose escalation. Tumor extension to the cervical spine was identified as a
predictor for failure outside of the primary site. Although the survival rates were
encouraging, there is still significant room for improvement in the management

ntracranial ependymomas are a common brain tumor in children
and comprise approximately 2% to 9% of all central nervous system (CNS) tumors in this age category.1,2 Although these tumors typically arise infratentorially, often filling the fourth ventricle, they can
arise not only in any ventricle but also in the brain parenchyma.3,4 Intracranial ependymomas are classified histologically as low-grade or
high-grade/anaplastic.5,6 Whereas some investigators have reported
no clear-cut differences in outcome between these groups, recent
studies suggest that, in fact, patients with anaplastic ependymomas
have a worse outcome.7–10 One reason why differences in outcomes
between low- and high-grade ependymomas have been difficult to

detect may be that, despite its histologically benign
appearance, low-grade ependymomas can display
very aggressive local behavior.
Current therapeutic standards for intracranial ependymoma include surgery to achieve maximal feasible tumor resection followed by radiation therapy
(RT).11 The extent of resection is one of the strongest
prognostic factors for predicting survival in patients
with these tumors. Previous studies reported a statistically significant improvement in survival after macroscopic (gross) total resection (GTR) versus subtotal
resection.3,4,12 Accordingly, the current Children’s Oncology Group (COG) study (ACNS0121) for intracranial ependymoma emphasizes the importance of GTR
and advocates the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
to help improve the resectability of tumors that previously were deemed unresectable. However, even if a
GTR is achieved, these tumors typically will recur
unless adjuvant RT is given.4,13 RT dose response in
ependymomas has been demonstrated for doses from
45 gray (Gy) to 50 Gy.7,13 Despite these doses, local
failure remains a major problem. Therefore, currently,
most patients receive an RT dose in the middle 50-Gy
to 60-Gy range.
Although there are many studies of patients with
intracranial ependymoma, relatively few have
reported a large, single-institutional pediatric population with long follow-up.4,7,10,12–17 Studies from institutions that treat a high volume of such patients
provide important outcome benchmarks and may
allow identification of additional prognostic factors
that have not been appreciated previously. This article
reports the outcome and identifies factors that affect
prognosis in all patients who were diagnosed and
treated primarily at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania (HUP) from 1980 to 2000.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sixty-one pediatric patients with intracranial ependymoma who underwent surgery between January 1980
and December 2000 were identified from the tumor
registry at CHOP. After eliminating patients who were
not treated and followed subsequently at CHOP or
HUP, 49 patients remained and formed the basis of
the current study. A subset of these patients (those
who were diagnosed before 1989; N 5 19) was
included as part of a previous study from our institution but, for the current report, had longer followup.7 With only 1 exception, all patients who were
included in the study were aged 18 years at diagnosis; the exception was a patient aged 20 years at diagnosis who was included because initial surgery

433

was performed at CHOP. All data were obtained from
patient charts at CHOP and/or HUP. Charts were
reviewed for details of patient and tumor characteristics, treatments received, and outcome. Approval for
this study was obtained from the appropriate Institutional Review Board prior to undertaking the study.
All surgery was performed by neurosurgeons at
CHOP. Extent of surgical resection was determined
by reviewing a combination of the operative notes
and/or postoperative imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI])
reports. All tissue specimens were diagnosed by a
neuropathologist at CHOP. All diagnoses of leptomeningeal tumor spread were made on the basis of MRI
and/or lumbar puncture for cytology. RT was delivered using linear accelerator-based, megavoltage
radiation through a variety of techniques, including
craniospinal treatment with standard methods and
either opposed lateral portals or other multifield
methods for focal treatment. Craniospinal irradiation
(CSI) was given as part of initial RT for evidence of
dissemination at presentation (5 patients), the presence of anaplastic histology (3 patients), and locally
advanced tumor in 1 patient aged 17 years. General
anesthesia was used in younger patients for simulation and/or treatment when appropriate. A variety of
chemotherapeutic regimens was used, which included the following agents: vincristine, methyllomustine, cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide,
ifosphamide, etoposide, methotrexate, and/or temozolomide. Patients were followed both clinically and
with serial imaging (MRI studies in the great majority
of patients).
All statistical analyses were performed using
STATA software (version 3.0; Computer Resource
Center, Santa Monica, Calif). Overall survival (OS)
and progression-free survival (PFS) curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In most
patients, OS and PFS were calculated from the time
of initial diagnosis. However, for the evaluation of
radiation parameters (eg, RT dose), OS and PFS were
calculated from the start of RT. The time to failure
was defined based either on the date of the appearance of recurrent tumor (primary or distant sites) or
the date when it was documented that residual disease was increasing in size. Again, for the evaluation
of RT parameters, if a patient failed after initial
deferral of RT, then the date of failure after RT was
used to calculate PFS. The log-rank test was used to
determine whether survival curves differed significantly in subgroup analyses. Univariate and multivariate analyses for potential prognostic factors were
performed using a Cox proportional-hazards model.
When building the multivariate models, factors with

P values >.200 were excluded. A 2-tailed Fisher exact
test was used to correlate contiguous tumor extension into the cervical spinal cord region at time of
initial diagnosis with subsequent failures outside of
the primary site. A 2-tailed Fisher exact test also was
used to correlate contiguous tumor extension into
the cervical spinal cord region at time of initial diagnosis with subsequent failures outside of the primary
site.

RESULTS
Patient/Tumor Characteristics and Treatment Parameters
Patient and tumor characteristics are summarized
(Table 1). Our series had a slight male preponderance (ratio, 1.33), consistent with what others have
reported.7,12 The median age at presentation was 5.6
years. Fifteen percent of patients had evidence of
CNS dissemination at diagnosis. Tumors in 25% of
patients were anaplastic. Slightly less than 66% of
patients had their primary tumor site in the posterior
fossa, and the remaining tumors were supratentorial
in location. The most common presenting symptom
was vomiting, which was reported by 69% of patients. Other common presenting symptoms included
headache (53%), ataxia (27%), head tilt (8%), and seizure (6%).

Four patients received chemotherapy both prior to and after RT.

Treatment parameters for patients on this study
are summarized (Table 2). Although maximal primary tumor resection was the objective in all
patients, a GTR was accomplished in only 63% of
patients. Adjuvant therapy with RT was the treatment
of choice for the great majority of patients. In this
setting, RT generally was started from 4 weeks to 6
weeks after surgical resection. However, 13 patients
received chemotherapy postoperatively as initial adjuvant therapy. Of these 13 patients, 2 patients proceeded to planned RT after the typical 4- to 6-week
delay postresection, and 11 patients received chemotherapy with the objective of delaying or deferring
RT until the child was older. Ten of these 11 patients
ultimately went on to receive RT at a median time
between diagnosis and the start of RT of 13.8 months
(range, 4.2–23.5 months). Of the 10 patients who
eventually received RT, 6 patients were treated for
progressive/persistent disease, and 4 patients received planned RT at a predetermined interval after
the initial diagnosis according the individual treat-

(95% CI, 17.3–45.5%), respectively. At the time of last
follow-up, 31 patients had failed initial therapy. The
pattern of these failures is summarized in Table 3.
The majority of failures were at the site of initial disease only (68%), and 16% of failures involved only
tumor outside of the initial disease site.

ment protocol. Four patients were not treated immediately with any adjuvant therapy postresection. Of
these patients, 3 (1 of whom underwent reresection)
ultimately went on to receive RT at 4.2 months, 5.1
months, and 44.9 months after their initial diagnosis,
when their tumors recurred. These 3 patients all had
infratentorial disease and remained alive and free of
disease post-RT with a total follow-up that ranged
from 8.4 years to 15 years. The other patient who did
not receive adjuvant RT had supratentorial disease
and low-grade histology; this patient was lost to follow-up without evidence of recurrence at 23 months.

Outcomes of Therapy in All Patients
The median follow-up for all patients (n 5 49) and
for the patients who remained alive at last follow-up
(n 5 30) were 61.0 months and 110.2 months (range:
9.5–237.1 months), respectively. OS and PFS curves
for all patients are shown in Figure 1. The median
PFS was 27.2 months, whereas the median OS was
not reached. The OS rates at 2 years, 5 years, and 10
years were 87.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI],
74.3–94.2%), 66.2% (95% CI, 50.1–78.2%), and 56.3%
(95% CI, 39.1–70.3%), respectively. The PFS rates at 2
years, 5 years and 10 years were 54.4% (95% CI,
39.4–67.2%), 40.7% (95% CI, 26.6–54.3%), and 30.9%

Analysis for Potential Prognostic Factors
Subgroup analysis of these patients using the logrank test revealed that age 3 years and radiation
dose 54 Gy significantly predicted for both
improved OS and improved PFS (Fig. 2A-D). When
patients who had delayed RT, because they received
either initial chemotherapy (N 5 10) or no other adjuvant therapy (N 5 3), were compared with patients
who received immediate postoperative RT, and the
length of OS did not differ significantly (Fig. 3). However, the curves suggest a somewhat worse outcome
for patients with RT delay, although the small patient
numbers likely contributed to the lack of statistical
significance. One additional factor that predicted a
longer OS was absence of disease extension to the
cervical spinal cord (Fig. 4A). It is noteworthy that, in
an evaluation of treatment failure patterns, we
observed a higher number of patients with failures
outside of the primary site (exoprimary) when tumor
extended through the foramen magnum. When the
analysis was limited to patients who had a posterior
fossa primary tumor and no initial dissemination,
[70% of patients with exoprimary failure had cord
extension, whereas only approximately 10% of
patients with disease confined to the posterior fossa
had exoprimary failure (P 5 .013; Fisher exact test)
(Fig. 4B). Because this study included many patients
who had 1 or more unfavorable feature(s), we separately examined our patients with good features
(aged 3 years, no dissemination or cord extension,
GTR, dose 54 Gy) and observed that OS and PFS at
5-years were improved at 83.1% (95% CI, 47.2–95.5%)
and 60.6% (95% CI, 29.4–81.4%), respectively (Fig. 5);
this compares favorably with what has been reported
by others.9,18,19
One significant departure from previous practice
on the current COG ACNS0121 protocol is to observe
patients with low-grade ependymomas of the supra-

tentorial brain who have undergone macroscopic
resection, reserving RT for salvage of treatment failures. To determine the outcomes of patients on our
study that fell in this category, we chose to examine
patients with supratentorial tumors, GTR, and no
evidence of CNS dissemination and determined outcomes by tumor grade. All 7 patients with these
characteristics and low-grade histology (6 of whom
received RT and none of whom received immediate
postoperative chemotherapy) were alive at last follow-up with a median follow-up [11 years. By contrast, all 4 patients with these characteristics and
anaplastic histology (all of whom received RT and 1
of whom also received immediate postoperative
chemotherapy) failed therapy, and 3 of them died
within 5 years of diagnosis (P 5 .016). In addition,
further questions remain regarding the outcome of

patients with supratentorial versus infratentorial primaries. Therefore, we chose to compare the OS of
patients with nondisseminated, macroscopically
resected, and low-grade histology tumors according
to primary disease site, and the OS rates at 5 years
and 10 years were 81.8% and 54.5%, respectively, for
patients with infratentorial primary tumors (N 5 11)
compared with 100% at both time points for patients
with supratentorial primary tumors (N 5 7). For our
defined subset of patients, this factor approached
statistical significance (P 5 .088).
Univariate analysis using the Cox proportionalhazards model was also performed to evaluate
potential prognostic factors in this patient cohort,
and the results are summarized in Table 4. It has
been demonstrated previously that a greater degree
of resection improves local control and survival.

Similarly, the current results indicate that patients
who undergo GTR appear to have improved outcomes compared with patients who undergo less
than complete resection, although the difference did
not reach statistical significance at the .05 level for
PFS (Table 4). In addition, consistent with the subgroup analysis described above, RT dose 54 Gy, age
3 years, and absence of spinal cord extension were
predictive of improved OS, and higher radiation dose
and age 3 years were predictive of improved PFS at
statistically significant levels. Even when only
patients who received a minimum of 50 Gy were
considered (6 patients received 50–54 Gy, and 39
patients received 54 Gy), the higher dose predicted
improved OS at a statistically significant level
(P 5 .013).
Multivariate analyses are summarized in Tables 5
and 6. Two separate analyses are presented, because
examination of the RT dose required calculation of
OS and PFS from the initiation of RT rather than
from initial diagnosis. In our initial multivariate analysis of all evaluable patients (N 5 44), only greater
resection continued to predict improved OS at a statistically significant level, although age 3 years
demonstrated a strong trend toward predicting
improved OS (Table 5). When PFS was considered as
the endpoint, tumor grade, age, and cord extension
were the factors included in the multivariate model.

Of these, only low-grade histology and age 3 years
were predictive of improved PFS at a statistically significant level (Table 5). When RT dose was included
in the multivariate analysis, only analyzable patients
who received RT were evaluated (N 5 42). In this

analysis, age 3 years, GTR, and low-grade histology
predicted for improved OS, whereas low-grade histology, lack of cervical cord extension, and RT dose 54
Gy predicted for improved PFS (Table 6). Surprisingly, CNS dissemination status did not predict
patient outcomes in either univariate analysis or
multivariate analysis in this study.

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 5. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) are
illustrated from the time of diagnosis for patients who had favorable prognostic features (aged 3 years, no dissemination or cord extension, macroscopic total resection, and radiation dose 54 grays; N 5 13). The times
when patients were censored are denoted by tick marks. The percentages of
patients who survived and who surviving without disease at 2 years, 5 years,
and 10 years are indicated.

We report the results of treatment of 49 pediatric
patients with intracranial ependymoma at CHOP and
HUP over 20 years. One strength of this study is the
long duration of follow-up, with a median of nearly
10 years for patients who remained alive at last follow-up. The PFS and OS rates at 5 years were 40.7%
and 66.2%, respectively, for all patients but were significantly better for the patients (n 5 13) who had
favorable features (60.6% and 83.1%, respectively).
These results compare favorably with the 74.7 
5.7% 3-year PFS reported by Merchant et al. on a
Phase II trial that explored the use of 3-dimensional
conformal radiation therapy at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital.19 However, direct comparisons
between these 2 series remain difficult. It must be
noted that, although we excluded patients aged \3
years in our group of patients with good prognostic
features, the St. Jude trial included significant numbers of patients in that age group. The St. Jude
data will require further maturation to allow accurate assessment of treatment outcomes on that
study.

It has been suggested by some retrospective studies that patients with supratentorial tumors fare
worse than patients with tumor originating in the
posterior fossa.10,17,20 Our data do not indicate a significant difference in outcome between these 2
groups, which is in agreement with most published
studies.3,7–9,13,16,18,19 However, when only patients
with nondisseminated, macroscopically resected,
low-grade histology tumors are considered, poorer
outcomes for patients with infratentorial tumors
approach statistical significance. In fact, our study
suggests that patients with a low-grade ependymoma
at a supratentorial site actually have very good outcomes after GTR and calls into question the need for
postoperative RT in these patients. It is noteworthy
that, of the 4 patients in our study who were
observed after surgery, 3 patients had low-grade histology and underwent GTR. Of these, the patient
with a supratentorial primary remained disease-free
during follow-up, whereas the 2 patients with infratentorial tumors progressed and required RT. Although the numbers are small, our data are
consistent with the conclusions of some previous
small surgical series21,22 and the current approach of
ACNS0121, which observes patients who have non-

disseminated supratentorial ependymomas with lowgrade histology after GTR.
Overall, our results are in agreement with previous reports, which indicated that age, degree of
resection, dose of radiation, and tumor grade can
influence outcome in this disease.4,7,10,12,16 These
factors all correlated with PFS and/or OS to varying
extents. Surprisingly, 1 factor that was not identified
as prognostic in our study was the presence of CNS
dissemination at diagnosis. We believe that low
patient numbers likely contributed to the lack of significance found for this factor. It is possible that
patients whose staging MRI scans demonstrated
areas of abnormal enhancement, in fact, did not
have metastatic disease, as has been noted in prior
publications.23,24 With respect to RT dose response,
although the standard of care for treatment of localized ependymoma is in the middle 50-Gy range with
standard fractionation, the evidence of an RT dose
response has been observed previously for doses up
to 45 Gy to 50 Gy.7,13 Our series demonstrated a dose
response up to 54 Gy; this is in line with what many
consider to be the recommended RT dose. Because
this study did not include many patients who
received doses greater than the middle 50-Gy range,

we were unable to address whether further improvement in response is observed with higher doses of
radiation. However, because local failures continue
to be a significant problem with these tumors,
Merchant et al. used a dose of 59.4 Gy in a singleinstitution study with good results, albeit with short
follow-up.19 The current multi-institutional ACNS0121
protocol also is exploring the use of this higher dose for
the treatment of intracranial ependymomas.
In addition to confirming prior reports that the
factors described above have prognostic significance,
we observed that direct extension of tumor to the
cervical spinal cord was associated with worse outcomes. In particular, patients who had such extension had a significantly elevated risk of failure distant
to the primary site. We are uncertain about the reason for this association. One possibility is that
tumors that are able to expand sufficiently to track
down the cord may have an elevated risk of occult
dissemination in the CNS at presentation. This
includes the possibility that tumor fragments more
frequently may be carried caudally because of alterations in CSF flow when tumor involves this restriction point at the foramen magnum. Alternatively,
surgical resection of tumor that extends to the cord
may increase the likelihood of dissemination. Finally,
it is possible that tumor that extended to the spinal
cord was not treated adequately because of inadequate imaging and fields, leading to a marginal miss.
This last scenario seems unlikely, because, under
those circumstances, we also would expect an
increased risk of local failure.
Treatment guidelines currently do not support
the use of CSI for localized intracranial ependymoma.14 Overall, our data generally support this policy, because only approximately 15% of failures were
located completely away from the primary site. However, because we did observe a high incidence of
exoprimary failures in patients with extension of disease to the cervical spinal cord, the question regarding the use of full CNS irradiation in selected
patients may need to be revisited. Cord extension as
a negative prognostic factor in intracranial ependymomas needs to be confirmed in other studies. However, if it is borne out as a significant prognostic
factor, then there are potential implications in the
workup and management of such patients. At a minimum, it emphasizes the need for vigilant evaluation
for CNS dissemination using spinal MRI and multiple
lumbar punctures for CSF cytology to increase sensitivity for finding CSF spread. CSI most likely still
should not be offered routinely unless there is documented CNS dissemination, even in patients with
cord extension.

Because RT to the brain can have major neuropsychological sequelae, especially in patients aged \3
years, chemotherapy has been attempted as a means
of delaying or avoiding RT to permit more time for
brain maturation. In our series, 11 patients received
chemotherapy with the objective of delaying RT,
whereas an additional 4 patients did not receive any
immediate therapy postoperatively. Although these
patients did not have worse outcomes at a statistically
significant level, the graphs suggest a possibility of
poorer outcomes; thus, this approach of delaying RT
needs to be taken with caution. These results are in
line with past experience. Although ependymomas do
respond to a variety of chemotherapies, to our knowledge to date, no regimens have proven effective at
prolonging survival in patients with this disease.3,4,9,18,20,25 Duffner et al. reported the use of
chemotherapy to delay RT in infants (aged \3 years)
who had a variety of brain tumors; in that report, PFS
was only 42  9.3% at 2 years in patients with ependymoma.26 Similarly, Grill et al. reported the results of a
French Society of Pediatric Oncology protocol that
explored delaying or avoiding RT through the use
of postoperative chemotherapy in young children
(aged  5 years) who had intracranial ependymoma.27
In that study, the 4-year PFS rte was only 22%  11%.
These results are substantially worse than would be
expected for patients who receive immediate RT. With
these poor outcomes in infants and young children
using the chemotherapy-first approach, ACNS0121
calls for treating infants as young as age 1 year with
postoperative RT without much delay. Even if modern
focal RT techniques are used in these infants, many
practitioners still worry that radiation dose to the
brain in such young patients will result in intelligence
quotient (IQ) declines. However, investigators at St.
Jude have reported that treatment of patients in this
age group with conformal RT did not lead to significant, measurable declines in neurocognitive function,
giving further support for the use of such an
approach,19 and those investigators subsequently
developed mathematical models for predicting IQ
based on patient age and brain dose-volume histograms that confirm the small effects of conformal
therapy to the posterior fossa on IQ in most patients.28
In conclusion, for all patients in our study, the 5year PFS rate was only approximately 40% despite
the receipt of multimodality therapy. Even with
favorable features, a patient could expect a 5-year
PFS rate of approximately 60% in our series. Examination of patients treated in the 1980s versus the
1990s did not reveal significant differences in outcomes (Table 4), suggesting that advances in imaging
and treatment technologies over that period have not

had a significant impact on our ability to control
these tumors. Therefore, major improvement in outcomes will likely come from altering treatment
approaches (eg, addition of molecularly targeted
therapy) rather than refining treatment technique.
Overall, in addition to confirming previous findings
by others, our study demonstrated an RT dose
response up to 54 Gy and indicated that tumor
extension to the cervical spine results in worse outcomes because of an increased risk of exoprimary
failures. Our dose-response data and the finding that
most failures are local gives us hope that further
dose escalation to 59.4 Gy on the current COG study
will improve control rates. The current COG protocol
also seeks to improve outcomes by improving resection extent prior to RT (through use of chemotherapy
and second-look surgery) and by treating children
aged \3 years with up-front RT. It remains to be
determined whether this approach will yield better
treatment results. Whatever the approach, these
brain tumors must be treated aggressively, because
even low-grade or benign histology lesions can be
difficult to control.
