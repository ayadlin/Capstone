Abstract
EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibition is efﬁcacious in cancer therapy, but initially sensitive tumors often develop
resistance. In this study, we investigated the potential to overcome acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors with
MEHD7945A, a monoclonal antibody that dually targets EGFR and HER3 (ErbB3). In cancer cells resistant to
cetuximab and erlotinib, we found that MEHD7945A, but not single target EGFR inhibitors, could inhibit tumor
growth and cell-cycle progression in parallel with EGFR/HER3 signaling pathway modulation. MEHD7945A was
more effective than a combination of cetuximab and anti-HER3 antibody at inhibiting both EGFR/HER3 signaling
and tumor growth. In human tumor xenograft models, we conﬁrmed the greater antitumor potency of
MEHD7945A than cetuximab or erlotinib. MEHD7945A retained potent activity in tumors refractory to EGFR
inhibitor alone. Furthermore, MEHD7945A also limited cross-resistance to radiation in EGFR inhibitor–resistant
cells by modulating cell-cycle progression and repair processes that control apoptotic cell death. Taken together,
our ﬁndings conﬁrm an important role of compensatory HER3 signaling in the development of acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors and offer preclinical proof-of-concept that MEHD7945A can effectively overcome
EGFR inhibitor resistance. Cancer Res; 73(2); 824–33. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Members of the ErbB/HER receptor family (EGFR, HER2,
HER3, HER4) play an important role in tumorigenesis and have
been studied intensively in cancer therapeutics. Blockade of
the EGF receptor (EGFR) using either monoclonal antibody
(mAb) or small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) offers
a promising approach that has been well validated over the last
decade (1, 2). Unfortunately, many patients who initially
respond to EGFR inhibitor treatments eventually manifest
tumor progression (3–5). Hence, efforts to better understand
underlying mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and potential strategies to overcome resistance, are
highly needed.
To understand underlying mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors, we previously established a series of
resistant clones to 2 different classes of EGFR inhibitors,
cetuximab (mAb) and erlotinib (TKI), from sensitive tumor

cell lines without EGFR and KRAS mutations following longterm EGFR inhibitor exposure (6, 7). Following systematic
screening, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant increase of p-EGFR and
p-HER3 in these resistant clones. Depletion of HER3 by siRNA
restored sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab (8).
Further analysis of these clones revealed an increase of
EGFR–HER3 dimerization and subsequent EGFR-dependent
activation of HER3. Consistent with this observation, several
studies indicated that acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors
may derive, in part, from activation of HER3 to effectively
bypass the effect of EGFR inhibition (9–11). As HER3 is an
obligate heterodimerization partner, these ﬁndings provide a
rationale for the evaluation of combinatorial EGFR/HER3
targeting approaches in tumors manifesting acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors.
As an inactive tyrosine kinase, HER3 is not amenable to
inhibition with ATP analogues. MEHD7945A is a recently identiﬁed dual target antibody against EGFR and HER3 that exhibits
dual action by inhibiting ligand dependent EGFR- and HER3mediated downstream signaling (12). MEHD7945A shows profound antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo across a variety of
tumor cell types when compared with the respective monospeciﬁc antibodies. In addition, MEHD7945A is effective in facilitating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity but
appears to induce less skin toxicity in comparison to cetuximab
in nonclinical studies. In the current study, we sought to
investigate the capacity of MEHD7945A to overcome acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors in our established cetuximab- and
erlotinib-resistant tumor cells derived from lung and head and

neck cancers. In addition, as previous studies suggested crossresistance to radiation in these resistant cells (7), we examined
the effect of MEHD7945A in regulating radiation response in
EGFR inhibitor–resistant cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies
MEHD7945A and anti-HER3 (DL3.6b) were provided by
Genentech, Inc. Cetuximab (Erbitux) was provided by ImClone
Systems Inc., and erlotinib (Tarceva) was provided by OSI
Pharmaceuticals. Antibodies against EGFR, p-EGFR (Y1173),
HER3, and Histone 3 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., and anti-p-DNAPK and Ku80 were obtained from
Thermal Scientiﬁc Lab Vision. Anti-a-tubulin was obtained
from Calbiochem. All other antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology, and all other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma.
Primary and EGFR inhibitor–resistant tumor cells
The primary human non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
H226 cells were provided by Drs John Minna and Adi Gazdar
(University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, TX)
and were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS. The human head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) SCC6 (UM-SCC6) cells were provided by Dr. Thomas E. Carey (University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and were cultured routinely in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone. These cells were
tested and authenticated by the provider. The acquired cetuximab- and erlotinib-resistant clones of H226 and SCC6 were
developed following long-term exposure to cetuximab or erlotinib as described previously (6, 7). All cell culture media and
supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.
Cell proliferation assay
Viable growing cells was determined by crystal violet staining as described previously (7).
Cell-cycle analysis
Tumor cells were harvested by trypsin followed by ethanol
ﬁxation. After centrifugation, cells were incubated with phosphate-citric acid buffer (0.2 mol/L Na2HPO4, pH 7.8, 4 mmol/L
citric acid) at room temperature for 45 minutes. Thereafter,
cells were stained with a solution containing 33 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI), 0.13 mg/mL RNase A, 10 mmol/L EDTA,
and 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 C for 4 hours. Stained nuclei were
analyzed for DNA-PI ﬂuorescence using a Becton Dickinson
FACScan ﬂow cytometer. Resulting DNA content was analyzed
by Modﬁt (Verity Software House Inc.) to determine the
proportion of cells in sub-G0, G0–G1, S, and G2–M phases of
the cell cycle.
EGFR inhibitor–resistant tumor xenografts
Athymic nude mice (3- to 4-week-old male) were obtained
from Harlan Bioproducts for Science and maintained in a
laminar airﬂow cabinet under aseptic conditions. The care
and treatment of experimental animals was in accordance with
Institutional Guidelines. Cetuximab- or erlotinib-resistant

tumor cells (1  106) were injected subcutaneously into the
dorsal ﬂank area of the mice. Following the establishment of
tumor, cetuximab or MEHD7945A was administered via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection twice per week, and erlotinib was
given by oral gavage 5 d/wk. Radiation treatment was delivered
by a cabinet X-ray biological irradiator X-RAD 320 from
Precision X-Ray, Inc. Mouse was immobilized using customdesigned jigs that only exposed the dorsal ﬂank with tumor
xenograft to irradiation without exposing non–tumor-bearing
normal tissues. Tumor volume was determined by direct
measurement with calipers and calculated by the formula:
p/6  (large diameter)  (small diameter)2.
Immunoﬂuorescent staining of gH2AX foci
Cells were plated on chamber slides and exposed to 10 mg/mL
of drugs for 1.5 hours before irradiation. Twenty-four hours
following 3 Gy radiation, cells were ﬁxed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were then
probed with anti-gH2AX antibody (Upstate) followed by Alexa
Fluor 594–conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Fluorescent gH2AX foci were then captured using a Zeiss Axioplan
ﬂuorescent microscope. To quantitate gH2AX foci, visual scoring of foci in 200 randomly chosen intact nuclei from irradiated
samples was determined after subtracting the background
numbers of foci from unirradiated samples.
Radiation survival
Survival following radiation exposure was deﬁned as the
ability of the cells to maintain their clonogenic capacity and to
form colonies. Brieﬂy, after exposure to radiation, cells were
trypsinized, counted, and seeded for colony formation in 35mm dishes at 50 to 5,000 cells/dish. Following 10 to 14 days,
colonies were stained with crystal violet and manually counted.
Colonies consisting of 50 cells or more were scored, and 4 to 10
replicate dishes containing 10 to 150 colonies/dish were
counted for each treatment.
Cellular fractionation and immunoblotting analyses
Cellular fractionation was conducted as described previously (13). Detailed information is provided in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Apoptosis assessment
Apoptosis was assessed by the loss of plasma membrane
asymmetry as one of the earliest features of apoptosis using
Annexin V/PI kit from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Detailed
information is provided in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Statistical analysis
Student t test was used to evaluate the signiﬁcance of
differences between 2 samples, and ANOVA was used to
evaluate differences among 3 or more groups in tumor xenograft studies. Differences between samples were considered
statistically signiﬁcant when P < 0.05. To assess additive or
synergistic effects, we used the fractional product method as
described previously (14). Brieﬂy, the observed fractional
tumor volume (FTV) is equal to the mean tumor volume of

cetuximab-treated, cetuximab-resistant cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). These results corresponded well to the antiproliferative effect of MEHD7945A shown in Fig. 1A. Further
immunobloting revealed a signiﬁcant inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways by MEHD7945A
but not cetuximab (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Maintenance of
PI3K/AKT signaling was observed in our resistant cells and is
known to be a critical factor for acquired resistance to EGFR
inhibitors in several previous studies (15), this result suggests
that MEHD7945A may overcome acquired resistance to cetuximab, in part, via inhibition of HER3/PI3K/AKT signaling.
We next compared the antiproliferative effect of
MEHD7945A against the combination of 2 monospeciﬁc antibodies, EGFR (cetuximab) and HER3 (DL3.6b), which is the
corresponding HER3 antibody in MEHD7945A (12). Using the
same concentration (10 mg/mL) of each antibody, we found
MEHD7945A more potent to inhibit cellular proliferation than
the combination of cetuximab and anti-HER3 antibody in both
cetuximab-resistant clones (Fig. 1B). Consistently, we found
MEHD7945A more effective than the combination of cetuximab and HER3 antibody to inhibit EGFR/MAPK and HER3/
PI3K/AKT signaling as shown in Fig. 1C. These results suggest
favorable clinical potential to investigate this dual target
antibody approach rather than multidrug combination therapy with monospeciﬁc EGFR and HER3 antibodies.

each treated group divided by the mean tumor volume of the
control group at each time point. The synergy assessment was
determined by calculating the ratio of FTV (drug)  FTV
(radiation)/FTV (drug þ radiation). A ratio greater than 1.0
suggests that the combined treatment effects are synergistic.

Results
MEHD7945A inhibits growth of cetuximab-resistant
tumor cells
We previously established acquired resistant clones to 2
distinct classes of EGFR inhibitor following long-term exposure to cetuximab or erlotinib in NSCLC and HNSCC tumor
cells. We ﬁrst compared the in vitro antiproliferative effect of
MEHD7945A with cetuximab in cetuximab-resistant clones
from H226 and SCC6. As shown in the left of Fig. 1A, both
cetuximab and MEHD7945A exhibited similar capacity to
inhibit the growth of parental H226 cells (small box ﬁgure).
Notably, MEHD7945A signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth of
H226-CetR cells that remained refractory to cetuximab treatment. Similar results were observed in the cetuximab-resistant
clone of SCC6 as shown in the right of Fig. 1A. While parental
SCC6 cells responded well to both antibody treatments (small
box), SCC6-CetR only responded to MEHD7945A. In analysis of
cell-cycle progression, we found that MEHD7945A induced a
signiﬁcant G0–G1 arrest accompanied by a reduction in the
percentage of cells in S-phase compared with control or

MEHD7945A Overcomes Resistance to EGFR Inhibitors

mice. Following establishment of tumors (150–200 mm3), mice
were treated with the same dose of cetuximab or MEHD7945A.
Treatment with MEHD7945A, but not cetuximab, induced
signiﬁcant growth delay of cetuximab-resistant tumors when
compared with untreated controls as shown in the left of Fig. 3.
More importantly, MEHD7945A was found to induce regression of tumors that were highly refractory to cetuximab as
shown at days 51 to 58. In contrast, cetuximab did not inhibit
the growth of tumors that were previously treated with
MEHD7945A. Similarly, erlotinib-resistant tumors responded
with growth delay to initial challenge with MEHD7945A, but
not erlotinib treatment. MEHD7945A also induce very brisk
regression in those tumors that remained highly refractory to
erlotinib treatment. These results conﬁrm and extend the
previous in vitro ﬁndings and indicate a profound capacity of
MEHD7945A to overcome acquired resistance to both cetuximab and erlotinib in vivo.

To further explore whether MEHD7945A could inhibit
tumor cell growth in another EGFR inhibitor–resistant setting,
we examined the effect of MEHD7945A on our erlotinibresistant cells. As expected, erlotinib inhibited the growth of
parental cells in a dose-dependent manner but had little effect
on erlotinib-resistant H226 cells as shown in the left of Fig. 2A.
This conﬁrmed the resistant phenotype of erlotinib-resistant
cells. Interestingly, MEHD7945A inhibited the growth of both
parental and erlotinib-resistant cells as shown in the right
of Fig. 2A. Similar results were observed in the parental and
erlotinib-resistant SCC6 cells (Fig. 2B). While both parental and
erlotinib-resistant SCC6 cells responded differently to erlotinib, they both responded well to MEHD7945A with a similar
pattern. As anticipated, parental cells responded better to
MEHD7945A than erlotinib resistant cells likely reﬂecting the
high expression of EGFR and HER3 in the resistant cells as
shown in our previous study (8). Taken together, these results
consistently show that MEHD7945A overcomes acquired resistant to both classes of EGFR inhibitors.

MEHD7945A overcomes cross-resistance to radiation
Our previous studies found a cross-resistance to radiation in
EGFR inhibitor–resistant cells following long-term exposure to
EGFR inhibitors (7). We therefore examined whether
MEHD7945A could overcome this cross-resistance to radiation
in EGFR inhibitor–resistant cells. We compared the radiation

response in cetuximab-resistant clones challenged with
MEHD7945A or cetuximab. Using clonogenic survival analysis,
we found that pretreatment of cetuximab did not change the
response proﬁle when compared with radiation-alone control
(NT). In contrast, treatment with MEHD7945A signiﬁcantly
reduced cell survival following radiation exposure in cetuximab-resistant H226 and SCC6 clones (Fig. 4A). In addition, we
characterized the DNA damage proﬁle following 3 Gy radiation
by examining the activation of the histone-variant H2AX that
becomes phosphorylated (gH2AX) following a reaction on
radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). As shown
in Fig. 4B, a signiﬁcant increase of gH2AX foci was observed in
MEHD7945A-pretreated, but not cetuximab-pretreated, cells
by a factor of 1.2 to 2.2 when compared with untreated control.
Interestingly, we found that MEHD7945A augmented radiation-induced DNA damage more signiﬁcantly in SCC6-CetR
than that of H226-CetR cells. This result is consistent with a
more profound cell killing in MEHD7945A-treated SCC6-CetR
cells when compared with H226-CetR cells determined by
clonogenic survival analysis (Fig. 4A). To further extend these
in vitro ﬁndings, we compared the capacity of cetuximab and
MEHD7945A to augment radiation response in our cetuximabresistant tumor xenograft model system. As shown in Fig. 4C,
SCC6-CetR tumors respond modestly to treatment with cetuximab, MEHD7945A, or radiation when compared with control
tumors. As expected, the combination of cetuximab and
radiation (XRT þ C) did not produce a signiﬁcant treatment
beneﬁt in the cetuximab-resistant tumors when compared
with the corresponding single treatment with cetuximab (P
> 0.05) or radiation (P > 0.05) up to day 66. However, tumor
response to MEHD7945A was considerably stronger than
that observed with cetuximab, and the combination of
MEHD7945A and radiation (XRT þ M) showed a signiﬁcant

tumor growth inhibition resulting in substantial growth delay
when compared with the corresponding single modality treatment with radiation (P < 0.01) or MEHD7945A (P < 0.05) from
day 44 or 51, respectively, to the end of the experiment on day
66. Additional statistical analysis using the fractional product
method (14) conﬁrmed that the combined MEHD7945A and
radiation treatment exhibited a strong synergy assessment
ratio between 1.2 and 1.47 from day 37 to the end of the
experiment on day 66. Although a modest enhancement of
radiosensitivity was observed in MEHD7945A-treated cells
from the in vitro clonogenic survival analysis (Fig. 4A), we
observed a profound impact of MEHD7945A to augment
radiation response in the cetuximab-resistant tumor xenografts. This result extends the in vitro ﬁndings and conﬁrms
that MEHD7945A can augment radiation response in cells that
remain refractory to cetuximab.
MEHD7945A inhibits radiation-induced survival and
damage repair pathways
To further investigate underlying mechanisms for the effect
of MEHD7945A on radiation response, immunoblotting was
conducted to examine the expression and activity of proteins
involved in regulating survival and DNA damage repair. As
shown in Fig. 5A, we observed the activation of HER family
members and their downstream MAPK and AKT signaling 24
hours after exposure to 6 Gy radiation in cetuximab-resistant
H226 cells. This radiation-induced survival signaling correlated
well with an increase of p-Rb that serves as a key factor to
stimulate G1 to S-phase transition. However, treatment with
MEHD7945A was superior to cetuximab to inhibit radiationinduced survival signaling and the level of p-Rb. We also
observed a signiﬁcant increase of phosphorylated p53 that is
critical in regulating cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in

MEHD7945A-treated cells. Consistently, a signiﬁcant increase
of cleaved PARP and caspase-3 that resulted from the activation of apoptosis was found in MEHD7945A-treated cells 48
hours after radiation.
As DNA damage response is initiated with the recognition of
damage and often results in cell-cycle arrest for repair, we next
examined whether MEHD7945A could inhibit repair capacity
by examining several key proteins involved in the repair of
lethal DSB. DNA protein kinase (DNAPK), Ku80, and XRCC-4
like factor (XLF) are involved in nonhomologous end joining,
and BRCA1 is essential for initiating homologous recombination repair. Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 form a complex in DSB
sites and act as crucial elements for DSB repair and cell-cycle
checkpoints (16). Inhibition of these molecules is known to

sensitize tumor cells to radiation. Following nuclear fractionation, we found that the level of most repair proteins in the
nucleus is increased following radiation exposure in the control nontreated cells (Fig. 5B), such as XCF, BRCA1, and pNBS1.
Treatment with MEHD7945A was more effective than cetuximab to reduce the level of all the tested repair proteins in cells
exposed to radiation. Interestingly, we found that a signiﬁcant
decrease of nuclear DNAPK in the MEHD7945A-treated cells
was accompanied by an increase of DNAPK in the non-nuclear
fraction. This result is consistent with previous ﬁndings suggesting that EGFR agents inhibit repair capacity by disrupting
nuclear import of functional DNAPK (17). The lack of nuclear
DNAPK import inhibition in the cetuximab-treated cells is
consistent with the cross-resistance to radiation observed in

Figure 5. MEHD7945A inhibits radiation-induced survival and damage repair signaling. A, H226-CetR cells were either nontreated (N) or pretreated with
10 mg/mL of cetuximab (C) or MEHD7945A (M) for 24 hours followed by 6 Gy radiation. Thereafter, cells were harvested at 0, 2, 24, or 48 hours after radiation

our cetuximab-resistant cells. Similar results were observed in
cetuximab-resistant SCC6 cells (data not shown). Taken
together, these results suggest that MEHD7945A augments
radiation response via the induction of cell-cycle arrest followed by the induction of apoptosis and cell death likely
reﬂecting inhibitory effects on DNA damage repair machinery.
MEHD7945A regulates cell-cycle progression and
apoptosis following radiation
To further investigate the effect of MEHD7945A on radiation-induced cell-cycle progression, we examined the cell-cycle
phase distribution of cetuximab-resistant cells 1 or 2 days
following exposure to 6 Gy radiation treatment. As shown
in Fig. 6A, the S-phase cell-cycle populations were enhanced 1
day after radiation in the untreated control of both EGFR
inhibitor–resistant clones. This result correlates well with
previous observations of an increase of proliferative and
survival signaling 24 hours after radiation (Fig. 5A). However,
treatment with MEHD7945A, but not cetuximab, induced a
robust increase of cell arrest in G0–G1 phase. Interestingly, we
found that MEHD7945A-treated cells resumed a similar cellcycle phase distribution to control cells 2 days after radiation.
Further analysis of cells with sub-G0 DNA content comprising
apoptotic cells and debris fractions identiﬁes a robust increase
of cells in MEHD7945A-treated but not cetuximab-treated cells
2 days after radiation (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To further validate this observation of apoptosis, we applied
another approach using Annexin V/PI ﬂow cytometry analysis.
Annexin V serves as a marker for the loss of plasma membrane
asymmetry representing an early feature of apoptosis. As
shown in Fig. 6B, there is a signiﬁcant increase of early
apoptotic cells in the MEHD7945A-treated H226-CetR cells 2
days (D2) after radiation when compared with control and
cetuximab-treated cells. There is only a modest increase of
apoptotic cells in MEHD7945A-treated group 1 day (D1) after

radiation. Similar results were observed in the cetuximabresistant SCC6 cells. These results again indicate that
MEHD76945A is inducing cell-cycle arrest early following
exposure to radiation. With the capacity to inhibit DNA repair
pathways, MEHD7945A appears to augment radiation effect
via apoptosis induction in these unrepaired cells at a latter
stage.

Discussion
In the current study, we provide evidence that MEHD7945A
can overcome acquired resistance in 2 distinct EGFR inhibitor–resistant model systems. Using established cetuximab- or
erlotinib-resistant cells from NSCLCs and HNSCCs, we ﬁnd
that MEHD7945A, but not EGFR inhibitors alone, effectively
inhibits MAPK and PI3K/AKT survival pathways that play a key
role in regulating acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (Fig.
1). Furthermore, MEHD7945A exhibits more potent antitumor
capacity than cetuximab or erlotinib in human tumor xenograft systems and effectively shrinks tumors that remain highly
refractory to cetuximab or erlotinib (Fig. 3). In addition,
MEHD7945A overcomes cross-resistance to radiation in these
EGFR inhibitor–resistant cells. This latter ﬁnding is noteworthy, as most EGFR inhibitor combinations with cytotoxic
chemotherapy have shown limited clinical beneﬁt (5, 18).
Although the combination of cetuximab and radiotherapy has
shown improved 5-year survival in patients with head and neck
cancer, a substantial proportion of patients eventually manifest tumor recurrence (19). As both EGFR and HER3 are
activated after radiation (Fig. 5A), MEHD7945A targeting of
both receptors offers a promising approach to overcome
acquired resistance in clinical therapy strategies that use
EGFR/radiation combinations.
Although speciﬁc mechanisms resulting in acquired clinical
resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation are not fully
understood, increasing evidence indicates that crosstalk

among HER family members represents a major factor affecting clinical efﬁcacy of HER-targeted therapy (20–22). Blockade
of one HER receptor can be functionally compensated by
another HER family member. Early studies in breast cancer
cells showed that trastuzumab inhibited signaling from HER2
but did not disrupt activation of dimerization between HER2
and other HER family members (11). Considerable evidence
points to HER3 and/or EGFR as key contributors to acquired
resistance against HER2 targeting agents (23). Similarly, we
and other investigators have shown that HER3 is involved in
regulating acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (8, 9, 24). In
addition, Engleman and colleagues identiﬁed that c-Met,
another receptor tyrosine kinase, induced acquired resistance
to geﬁtinib via coupling to HER3 and activation of HER3/PI3K/
AKT signaling. (10). Interestingly, we found that the impact of
MEHD7945A was more potent than dual agent blockade of
EGFR by the combination of cetuximab and erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S3), which shuts down EGFR and has shown to
be superior to either agent alone in our previous study (6).
These ﬁndings reveal an important role of HER3 as a signaling
hub for the HER family that results in compensatory pathways
for EGFR inhibitors. These ﬁndings also highlight the potential

value to inhibit functions of multiple HER family members to
achieve the broadest clinical efﬁcacy to overcome acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy. The capacity of
MEHD7945A to overcome the primary (intrinsic) resistance
to EGFR inhibitor therapy still needs to be examined, as the role
of HER3 in regulating intrinsic resistance to EGFR inhibitors is
not yet well characterized. A separate study is near completion
to investigate the effect of MEHD7945A on the growth and
radiation response of primary lung and head and neck tumor
cell lines with variable sensitivities to cetuximab (25).
This 2-in-1 MEHD7945A targets both EGFR and HER3,
thereby offering a combinatorial targeted therapy (12). Interestingly, we found that MEHD7945A was more effective than
the combination of individual anti-EGFR and anti-HER3 antibody to inhibit tumor cell growth and MAPK and PI3K/AKT
signaling pathways in cetuximab-resistant cells (Fig. 1B and C).
Beyond a difference in binding afﬁnity between MEHD7945A
and the monospeciﬁc antibodies, the ability of MEHD7945A to
simultaneously target EGFR/HER3 in close proximity or cluster could be another crucial factor to explain the superior effect
of MEHD7945A over the combination of cetuximab and antiHER3 antibody. Increasing evidence has shown the existence of

EGFR dimers or clusters in cells even in the absence of ligand
stimulation (26, 27). This alternate dimer is an important
intermediate form in the transition of the inactive receptor
to the active, untethered dimer (28). As heterodimerization
of EGFR was known to produce the most profound downstream signaling, MEHD7945A could then be more powerful
than combination of individual targeting agents to shut
down the proliferation signaling via its ability to bind to
EGFR/HER3 clusters. Furthermore, it was recently established that combination of noncompetitive anti-EGFR antibodies synergistically reduce surface receptor level and lead
to enhanced tumor cell killing and prolonged survival in a
variety of mouse models (29, 30). Friedman and colleagues
proposed that synergism results from the formation of large
clusters of receptors on the cell surface following combination antibody treatment (29). With the potential of
MEHD7945A to increase the formation of EGFR/HER3 clusters, it will be of interest to further investigate whether
MEHD7945A can enhance EGFR and HER3 internalization
and degradation in tumor cells.
HER2 also appears to be involved in regulating acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Following long-term exposure to
cetuximab in vitro, Yonesaka and colleagues found ampliﬁcation of HER2 gene and/or increased neuregulin concentration
in cetuximab-resistant clones of lung and colorectal cancers
(31). Further analysis suggested that aberrant HER2 signaling,
either through HER2 gene ampliﬁcation or through autocrine
neuregulin activation of HER3, led to persistent MAPK signaling and consequently to cetuximab resistance. Quesnelle and
Grandis also identiﬁed activated HER2, but not HER2 gene
ampliﬁcation as the underlying mechanism for acquired resistance to cetuximab in bladder tumor cells established from an
in vivo model system (32). Interestingly, we found that
MEHD7945A could also inhibit phosphorylation of HER2 in
our resistant cells (Fig. 5A). It would be of interest to explore
the capacity of MEHD7945A to overcome EGFR inhibitor
resistance in tumors with activated HER2. In addition, it may
also be valuable to explore whether MEHD7945A is applicable
to HER2-overexpressing breast cancers refractory to trastuzumab, as EGFR and HER3 have been implicated as key factors to
regulate trastuzumab resistance.
Acquired resistance presents a considerable challenge to the
optimal clinical advancement of EGFR molecular targeting
agents. In addition, resistance to EGFR agents may co-associate with resistance to other cancer drugs and radiation. Data
from the current study suggest that MEHD7945A is able to
overcome cross-resistance to radiation via inhibition of radiation-induced survival signaling and DNA damage repair that
results in the induction of apoptosis (Figs. 4–6). Treatment
with MEHD7945A, but not cetuximab, inhibited radiationinduced survival signaling and resulted in cell-cycle arrest
within 24 hours after radiation. Following inhibition of DNA
repair machinery following exposure to MEHD7945A, most
unrepaired cells entered apoptosis by 48 hours after radiation.
Furthermore, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant increase of p-p53 in
cells treated with MEHD7945A (Fig. 4B). These data are
notable, as recent work reveals p53 as a critical factor in
regulating acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radia-

832

tion (15). Knocking down wild-type p53 in sensitive H226 cells,
we observe a reduction in the sensitivity to cetuximab and
radiation. In contrast, with reconstitution of functional p53,
cetuximab-resistant cells show sensitivity to both treatments
(15). Hence, it is possible that MEHD7945A overcomes
acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation via
p53-regulated pathways. Beyond radiotherapy, p53 and AKT
pathways have been shown to regulate acquired resistance to
several chemotherapeutic agents (33, 34). It will be of interest
to examine the potential of MEHD7945A to overcome resistance to the combined administration of EGFR inhibitors
and chemotherapy. Additional experiments are underway to
explore this question.
In conclusion, MEHD7945A, a dual targeting antibody
against both EGFR and HER3, shows the capacity to overcome
acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation. Results
from the current work suggest that MEHD7945A offers a
promising therapeutic approach for combinatorial molecular
target therapy. The single-agent simplicity of MEHD7945A also
provides an opportunity to combine with other agents that
have been shown to regulate resistance to EGFR therapy. Our
improved understanding of HER family signaling biology suggests that agents such as MEHD7945A may prove highly
valuable to advance the overall impact of EGFR therapy in
cancer and help address the challenge of acquired resistance.
Clinical trials are in development with MEHD7945A that will
further investigate several of these important questions.
