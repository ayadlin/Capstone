Abstract
Obese postmenopausal women have increased risk of breast cancers with poorer clinical outcomes than
their lean counterparts. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. Rodent
model studies have recently identiﬁed a period of vulnerability for mammary cancer promotion, which emerges
during weight gain after the loss of ovarian function (surgical ovariectomy; OVX). Thus, a period of transient
weight gain may provide a life cycle–speciﬁc opportunity to prevent or treat postmenopausal breast cancer.
We hypothesized that a combination of impaired metabolic regulation in obese animals prior to OVX plus an
OVX-induced positive energy imbalance might cooperate to drive tumor growth and progression. To determine if
lean and obese rodents differ in their metabolic response to OVX-induced weight gain, and whether this difference
affects later mammary tumor metabolism, we performed a nutrient tracer study during the menopausal window
of vulnerability. Lean animals preferentially deposited excess nutrients to mammary and peripheral tissues rather
than to the adjacent tumors. Conversely, obese animals deposited excess nutrients into the tumors themselves.
Notably, tumors from obese animals also displayed increased expression of the progesterone receptor (PR).
Elevated PR expression positively correlated with tumor expression of glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes, glucose
uptake, and proliferation markers. Treatment with the antidiabetic drug metformin during ovariectomy-induced
weight gain caused tumor regression and downregulation of PR expression in tumors. Clinically, expression array
analysis of breast tumors from postmenopausal women revealed that PR expression correlated with a similar
pattern of metabolic upregulation, supporting the notion that PRþ tumors have enhanced metabolic capacity
after menopause. Our ﬁndings have potential explanative power in understanding why obese, postmenopausal
women display an increased risk of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 72(24); 6490–501. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Obesity increases incidence, progression, and mortality from
breast cancer (1), with the adverse effects of obesity primarily
observed in postmenopausal woman (1, 2). After menopause,
adipose tissue becomes a signiﬁcant site for the production of
estrogens, which may lead to tumor promotion in obese women.
Supporting this assertion, some studies indicate that circulating
estrogens are higher with increasing weight (3) and obesity
generally promotes hormone-dependent tumors (4, 5). A recent
study has also shown that adipose tissue aromatase activity

increases with adiposity (6). Despite this evidence, local levels
of estrogens in breast tissue of postmenopausal women were
unaffected by obesity (7). Furthermore, a decrease in both breast
cancer risk and mortality was recently reported in postmenopausal women receiving oral estrogens, independent of body
mass index (BMI; ref. 8). Thus, while estrogen and obesity clearly
interact to inﬂuence breast cancer, our understanding of this
complex relationship remains incomplete.
Obesity is associated with impaired whole body metabolism,
including a decreased ability to quickly clear and store excess
calories during periods of overfeeding (9, 10). Weight gain is
very common during menopause, in part, because loss of
ovarian estrogen reduces leptin sensitivity in the hypothalamus, thus promoting overfeeding (11). Unless proactive measures are made to replace the loss of ovarian estrogen, restrict
energy intake, and/or increase energy expenditure postmenopause, weight gain ensues (12). Calorie restriction and/or
weight loss reportedly reduces tumorigenesis and the mitogenic potential of serum (13–16). Conversely, the overfeeding
and weight gain associated with menopause is anticipated to
create a host environment rich in circulating excess nutrients
(particularly glucose and fatty acids), and growth factors
[insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), EGF, and leptin],

Impact of Obesity and Overfeeding on Mammary Tumor Metabolism

all of which have been shown to promote tumor cell growth
(17). This tumor-promoting humoral milieu is predicted to be
exacerbated in obese patients because of the preexisting
impairment in energy metabolism.
We have studied the impact of premenopausal obesity on
postmenopausal breast cancer outcomes in an experimental
paradigm that merges models of obesity (10, 18, 19), mammary
tumorigenesis (20, 21), and menopause (ovariectomy; OVX;
ref. 22). In that study, an effect of premenopausal obesity on
tumor promotion emerged during the period of rapid, OVXinduced weight gain (23). In the present study, we used this
model and found that premenopausal obesity status and
menopause-induced overfeeding inﬂuence mammary tumor
glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and identiﬁed a putative
novel role for progesterone receptor (PR) in mediating these
effects.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Female Wistar rats (100–125 g; 5 weeks) purchased from
Charles River Laboratories were individually housed in metabolic caging at 22 to 24 C and 12:12-hour light-dark cycle with
free access to water. To induce obesity, rats were maintained
on puriﬁed high-fat diet (HF; 46% kcal fat; Research Diets,
RD#D12344). All animal procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Obesity and postmenopausal breast cancer model
Rats were injected with 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU,
50 mg/kg) at 52  1 days of age to induce mammary tumor
formation, as previously described (23). MNU was purchased
by the NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standards Repository operated under contract by Midwest Research
Institute (N02-CB-07008). From 10 to 18 weeks of age, rats
were ranked by their rate of weight gain in response to the
HF diet. Rats in the top and bottom tertiles of weight gain
were classiﬁed as obesity-prone (OP) and obesity-resistant
(OR), respectively, and matured to produce obese and relatively lean animals. Rats from the middle tertile were
removed from the study. Rats were palpated weekly throughout the study to detect tumors, and tumors were measured
in 3 dimensions using digital calipers. Fourteen lean and
16 obese tumor-bearing animals entered the OVX phase of
the study based on tumor burden. Rats were ovariectomized under isoﬂurane anesthesia and allowed 4 to 6 days to
recover. At OVX, mammary tumor biopsies were obtained
via ﬁne-needle aspiration (FNA). Body weight and food
intake were monitored weekly before surgery and daily
thereafter (18, 22). Body composition was determined at
OVX and at sacriﬁce by quantitative magnetic resonance
(qMRI; Echo MRI Whole-Body Composition Analyzer).
Metabolic monitoring system
During surgical recovery, animals were placed in a metabolic monitoring system (Columbus Instruments) for the
remainder of the study. This system includes a multichamber indirect calorimeter to estimate energy intake, total
energy expenditure, and fuel use from measurement of

www.aacrjournals.org

oxygen consumption (vO2), carbon dioxide production
(vCO2), and urinary nitrogen (10, 18, 22). We have previously
reported a 3-week period of rapid weight gain following OVX
(22, 23). To ensure our nutrient tracer study was conducted
during this weight gain period, but before weight gain
plateaued, the tracer study was conducted 10.5  0.7 days
after surgical recovery.
Dual-tracer protocol
During the ﬁnal 24 hours of the study, a dual-tracer
approach was used to monitor the trafﬁcking of glucose
and dietary fats in each animal (10, 24, 25). A 1-14C-oleate/
1-14C palmitate tracer was blended with the HF diet to
achieve a speciﬁc activity of 0.52 mCi/kcal of dietary lipid.
Animals had ad libitum access to this diet during the 24-hour
monitoring period and up to the time of sacriﬁce. Two hours
before completion of the study period, each animal received
an intraperitoneal injection of 3H-2-deoxyglucose (3H-2DOG,
100 mCi) to measure tissue-speciﬁc glucose uptake. 14C and
3
H content of individual tissues was determined as previously described (10, 24, 25).
Low and high energy excess groups
To dissect the individual contributions of obesity and excess
energy to our outcome measurements, the lean and obese
groups were subclassiﬁed by mean energy imbalance (intake
minus expenditure) during the window of rapid weight gain.
Subclassiﬁcation was based on each animal's average energy
balance during the 48-hour period before sacriﬁce (Fig. 1A and
B) and were termed low (9.3 kcal/day excess; n ¼ 7 lean and 7
obese) and high (26.7 kcal/day excess; n ¼ 7 lean and 9 obese)
energy excess.
Plasma and urine measurements
Tail vein blood was collected on the second diestrus day of
the estrous cycle (22) during the week before OVX, and after
OVX at sacriﬁce. All blood draws were made during the latter
part of the light cycle, and plasma was isolated and stored at
80 C. Plasma 17b-estradiol was measured by ELISA (Cayman
Chemical). Insulin, leptin, amylin, and glucagon were simultaneously measured using the Rat Endocrine LINCOplex Assay
(RENDO-85K; Millipore). Colorimetric assays were used to
measure free fatty acids (Wako Chemicals), glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol (#TR15421, TR22321, and TR13521,
respectively; Thermo-Fisher). Urinary nitrogen was estimated
from measurements of urea and creatinine in 24-hour urine
collections as described (18, 19).
Quantitative real time-PCR
RNA was isolated from pre-OVX tumor FNAs and post-OVX
pulverized tumors using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and quantitative
real-time (qRT) PCR was conducted as described (26) using
primer/probe sets shown in Supplementary Table S1. Total
RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Verso cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Thermo-Fisher). Transcript copy numbers were calculated
using the standard curve method (26), and expressed relative to
actin. Targets that ampliﬁed below the standard curve were
not considered to be expressed.

Targeted PCR arrays
Genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism were
analyzed in end-of-study tumors using pathway-focused PCR
arrays (PARN-006 and PARN-007, respectively; SABiosciences)
following the manufacturer's instruction. Data were normalized to the mean expression of 2 housekeeping genes (Rplp1
and Rpl13a) using the comparative Ct method.
Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting
Mammary tumors were classiﬁed histologically by the criteria of Young and Hallowes (27) and only adenocarcinomas
were included in the subsequent analyses. Western blotting for
PR was conducted using standard protocols (Supplementary
Methods). Mammary tumors (56 tumors, 2 sections/tumor, 8–
10 ﬁelds/section) were stained using immunohistochemistry
(IHC) for estrogen receptor-a (ER-a), PR, and Ki-67. Antibodies/conditions are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.

Adipocyte cellularity
At sacriﬁce, retroperitoneal and tumor-free inguinal mammary fat pads were removed, weighed, and a portion of each
was immediately processed to characterize adipocyte cellularity as described (ref. 10; see Supplementary Methods).
Metformin intervention
A separate cohort of obese adult rats entered the OVX phase
of the study based on tumor burden, at which time they were
randomized to either metformin (2 mg/mL in the drinking
water; n ¼ 11) or control (water only; n ¼ 9) groups. Metformin
treatment was initiated one week before OVX, and was maintained for study duration. At the time of OVX, mammary
tumors were biopsied by FNA. Body weight and tumor volumes
were monitored weekly for the duration of the study.

Impact of Obesity and Overfeeding on Mammary Tumor Metabolism

Analysis of human PRþ tumors
Seven publically available microarray datasets of human
breast cancers (29–35) were analyzed to determine whether
PR status correlated with changes in expression of genes
comprising speciﬁc metabolic pathways in human tumors.
Datasets were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). These gene expression
proﬁles are from patients with breast cancer that include a
range of ages and PR status, as summarized in Supplementary
Table S3. Arrays from each dataset were normalized with the
robust multichip average (RMA) algorithm (36), and probesets
were collapsed to genes by ﬁnding the maximum signal for each
gene. Each dataset was normalized by mean centering and
scaling, and then combined into a single dataset. Because
HER2 status was unknown for many tumors, our analysis was
restricted to tumors that were ERþ or PRþ to ensure triplenegative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) tumors were excluded. Thus, analysis
included ERþ/PRþ, ERþ/PR, and ER/PRþ samples. Gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA, v. 2.07; ref. 37) was conducted
on this combined dataset using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG) pathway deﬁnitions obtained from
Molecular Signatures Database v. 3.0. All analyses except GSEA
were conducted in R/Bioconductor v. 2.8.
Statistical analysis
Unless indicated, data were examined with SPSS 18.0 software by ANOVA or c2 analysis, for nominal and ordinal data,
respectively. Relationships between variables were assessed
with the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient. Differences and
relationships were considered statistically signiﬁcant when
P < 0.05. Error bars on all graphs represent SEM.

Results
Baseline characteristics of tumor-bearing rats before
OVX
Morphometric and plasma characteristics before OVX are
shown in Supplementary Table S4. Obese animals weighed 23%
more and had 35% higher percentage of body fat compared
with lean animals. Consistent with their increased adiposity,
obese animals had signiﬁcantly higher levels of leptin and
triglycerides, and tended to have higher insulin, amylin, glucagon, cholesterol, and nonesteriﬁed fatty acids (NEFA). Similar to previous work with this model (23), at the time of OVX,
the lean and obese groups did not differ in tumor incidence,
burden, or mean number of tumors per animal (Supplementary Table S4).
OVX-induced weight gain
As anticipated, OVX signiﬁcantly increased the rate of
weight gain in all animals (2.8  0.5 g/day). In addition, the
maximum rate of weight gain occurred during the 3-week period
following OVX, a window of time that we previously characterized as correlating with maximum energy imbalance (23). As
expected, total energy expenditure was signiﬁcantly higher in
obese animals, compared with lean (P < 0.05; Fig. 1A), due to
higher total body weight. To dissect the individual contributions
of obesity and excess energy, the lean and obese groups were

www.aacrjournals.org

subclassiﬁed by mean energy imbalance (intake minus expenditure) during the 48-hour period before sacriﬁce. Differences
in energy imbalance between the low and high energy excess
groups, however, were due primarily to increased energy intake
in the high energy excess group (P < 0.05; Fig. 1A). As a result,
the lean and obese high energy excess groups experienced
an additional 16.2 and 18.7 kcal/day excess, respectively, relative to their low energy excess counterparts (Fig. 1B).
Humoral proﬁles during OVX-induced weight gain
Obesity-associated insulin resistance impairs the body's
response to metabolic stress. During OVX-induced weight
gain, endocrine factors and metabolites reﬂective of insulin
resistance were measured. Obese animals exhibited higher
levels of insulin and amylin, and a trend for higher leptin
(Supplementary Table S4). These differences were not affected
by the extent of overfeeding (low vs. high energy excess; data
not shown) suggesting that the obesogenic state before OVXinduced weight gain drives this humoral pattern.
Differential glucose uptake and dietary fat retention in
tissues and tumors
We next investigated if adiposity and/or excess energy
affected glucose uptake and retention of dietary fat in
tumors and peripheral tissues during OVX-induced weight
gain. Lean animals showed an increase in glucose uptake in
their peripheral tissues (liver, adipose, muscle, and mammary gland) when experiencing a large energy excess (Table
1). In normal, tumor-free inguinal mammary tissue, glucose
uptake was more than 70% higher in the lean high energy
excess group when compared with the lean low energy
excess animals (P < 0.05). Increased glucose uptake was
also signiﬁcant in the liver (33%, P < 0.05) and trended for
skeletal muscle (34%, P ¼ 0.13) and retroperitoneal adipose
tissue (39%, P ¼ 0.11). In addition, we saw a similar trend for
increased retention of dietary fat in the peripheral tissues
from lean high energy excess animals, but these differences
did not achieve statistical signiﬁcance. These data reﬂect a
normal metabolic response to overfeeding, which allows
lean animals to clear and store excess nutrients in peripheral
tissues. In obese animals, the converse was found. Despite
high levels of insulin and excess nutrients, overfeeding did
not affect glucose uptake in normal mammary glands,
skeletal muscle, liver or retroperitoneal adipose (Table 1).
Dietary fat retention was similarly unaffected by overfeeding
in the obese, with the exception of the mammary gland
where retention of dietary fat was increased.
Nutrient uptake and retention by mammary tumors in these
same animals contrasted the normal mammary tissue. In
lean animals, increased energy excess did not affect tumor uptake of glucose or dietary fat. However, in obese animals, where
normal tissues were generally unresponsive to changes in energy
excess, tumor glucose uptake increased by approximately 50%
(Table 1), whereas retention of dietary fat tended to decrease.
The nutrient preference (ratio of glucose uptake to dietary
fat retention) of both normal mammary tissue and tumors is
shown in Fig. 1C. This comparison emphasizes that, in
response to excess energy, mammary tissue in lean animals

increases uptake of glucose relative to fat, yet these glands in
the obese are unresponsive (Fig. 1C, left). Conversely, mammary tumors from lean animals do not show a preference for
glucose over fat with overfeeding, whereas those in the obese
show a signiﬁcant glucose preference (Fig. 1C, right), characteristic of an "aggressive" metabolic phenotype described as the
Warburg effect (38).
Small mammary adipocytes in lean rats may explain
increased glucose uptake
Small adipocytes are more responsive to insulin stimulated
glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis (39). We compared
adipocyte size in both lean and obese animals during OVXinduced weight gain. Lean rats had a higher proportion of small
adipocytes (<30 mm) in their mammary glands, when compared with the obese animals (Fig. 1D). This is consistent with
the increased glucose uptake observed in the mammary gland
of these animals during overfeeding.
Obesity increases tumor PR expression
Tumor FNAs, obtained immediately before OVX, were evaluated for expression of ER-a, PR, and HER2, and RNA levels of
ER-a and HER2 were not different between the lean and obese
groups. However, tumors from obese rats had a signiﬁcantly
higher expression of PR than those from the lean (Fig. 2A). PR
expression did not seem estrogen dependent, as expression of
classical estrogen-responsive genes were not similarly induced
(data not shown). These data show that obesity before OVX
enhances tumor expression of PR.
The expression of ER-a, PR, and HER2 was also analyzed at
end of study (Fig. 2B). Similar to the pre-OVX expression, PR
RNA expression trended and staining by IHC was increased

6494

signiﬁcantly only in the obese high energy excess group compared with the lean high energy excess group, with no differences observed under low energy excess conditions (Fig. 2B–
D). Western blotting conﬁrmed PR-A as the dominant isoform
present (Fig. 2G).
PR expression correlates with tumor glucose uptake,
proliferation, and a glycolytic proﬁle
Having identiﬁed tumor PR expression as a distinguishing
characteristic of obese animals, we examined the proliferative
and metabolic characteristics associated with PRþ tumors
based on immunohistochemical classiﬁcation. PRþ tumors
had 2.4 times more Ki-67–positive cells compared with PR
tumors (Fig. 2E and F, P < 0.05), suggesting a higher rate of
proliferation in PRþ tumors. PRþ tumors exhibited approximately 50% increase in glucose uptake and lower retention of
dietary fat under high energy excess conditions, when compared with PR tumors (Fig. 2H and I), suggesting a putative
role for PR in mediating glucose uptake. In addition, fatty acid
synthase (FASN) expression was higher in the PRþ, high energy
excess tumors (Fig. 2J); in contrast, expression of the fatty acid
transporter Slc27a3 was lower in these same tumors (P < 0.05;
data not shown).
To further understand the relationship between PR and fuel
metabolism in tumors, we measured expression of genes
involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism pathways. PRþ
tumors exhibited higher expression of genes involved in the
pentose phosphate pathway (Fig. 3A), glycogen use (Fig. 3B),
glycolysis (Fig. 3C), and the TCA cycle (Fig. 3D). Many of these
genes were further increased in response to overfeeding. These
differences (summarized in Fig. 4) suggest that tumor PR
expression is associated with a higher glycolytic capacity, an

improving the whole-body metabolic response to overfeeding would decrease tumor burden. To test this hypothesis,
obese animals were treated with the commonly used antidiabetic drug metformin, which improves insulin sensitivity
in individuals with type 2 diabetes (40). Tumor burden 3
weeks after OVX was signiﬁcantly lower in animals receiving

metformin (Fig. 5A). Metformin treatment also signiﬁcantly
lowered tumor PR expression without affecting ER-a or
HER2 expression (Fig. 5B). Together, these data suggest a
potential role for metformin in targeting PR-driven tumor
metabolism and reducing tumor burden during OVXinduced weight gain.

Impact of Obesity and Overfeeding on Mammary Tumor Metabolism

Figure 4. Summary of changes in
PRþ tumors, relative to PR tumors
following OVX-induced weight gain.
Data represents signiﬁcant changes
( , P < 0.05) and trends (†, P < 0.10) as
identiﬁed via qRT-PCR or PCR
arrays.

Human PRþ tumors have enhanced metabolic capacity
To determine whether the metabolic changes identiﬁed in
PRþ tumors from our rodent model extended to human
breast cancers, we analyzed 7 publicly available microarray
datasets of breast tumors (29–35), resulting in a combined
1,434 tumors, with 585 cases identiﬁed as occurring in
postmenopausal women (55–75 years of age; Supplementary
Table S3). Patients included in our analysis were diverse with
respect to time since menopause, BMI, genetic background,
and energy balance under which the tumors were obtained.
When compared with PR tumors, PRþ tumors showed
increased expression of genes involved in carbohydrate and
protein metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, heme synthesis,
ATP production, and cell growth (Table 2). Notably, this
enrichment in carbohydrate and protein metabolic genes
indicates that PRþ tumors from postmenopausal women
have developed the metabolic infrastructure to use any fuel
source that becomes available for subsequent energy pro-

duction and to generate the building blocks required for cell
growth/proliferation, thus corroborating our ﬁndings in the
rat model.

Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to examine the combined effects of
obesity and overfeeding on the molecular and metabolic
characteristics of tumors after the loss of ovarian function.
In lean animals, peripheral tissues, including the mammary
gland, respond to a positive energy imbalance with increased
uptake of both glucose and fat, whereas their tumors showed
no change in nutrient uptake. In contrast, peripheral tissues
from obese animals showed little response in glucose or fat
uptake but their tumors exhibited much higher glucose
uptake. The impaired metabolic response to excess energy
in peripheral tissues of the obese animals was accompanied
by higher circulating levels of growth factors and metabolites known to promote tumor survival and growth. In

addition, tumors that developed in an obesogenic environment had increased expression of PR before OVX that was
maintained during the critical window of OVX-induced
weight gain. The elevated tumor PR expression was associated with increased glucose uptake, a glycolytic–lipogenic
gene expression proﬁle, and higher proliferation. Metformin
is associated with increased breast cancer survival in diabetic patients (41) and is known to improve metabolic
regulation (40). While causality was not established, a role
for PR in enhancing the metabolic capacity of tumors is
supported by our ﬁndings in both rodents and human
tumors. Together, these observations support a dual impact
of obesity on postmenopausal tumor promotion by: (i)
altering the metabolic and proliferative characteristics of
tumors before OVX through increased PR expression; and
(ii) impairing the metabolic response to excess energy in
peripheral tissues while enhancing nutrient uptake by
tumors. Thus, obesity and overfeeding may converge to
enhance tumor survival and growth, despite the loss of
ovarian sex hormone production.
We have previously reported that obese rodents experience ﬂuctuations in energy balance over the estrous cycle
that are longer in duration and larger in magnitude than
those experienced by their lean counterparts (22). This
repeated cycle of metabolic extremes, with nutrient excess
and deprivation coinciding with low and high levels of
estrogen and progesterone, respectively, may elicit adaptations in tumors that make them more ﬂexible to the
dramatic environmental changes during menopause. Obesity-induced PR expression in tumors could be one such
adaptation. PR is a well-known target of estrogen, raising the
possibility that higher levels of estrogens in the obese could
be responsible for the PR phenotype of tumors. However, we
have found no differences in levels of circulating estrogens
between lean and obese animals after OVX in this model (22,
23), and PR expression was observed in the absence of
estrogen-responsive genes. These data show that the obesogenic state before OVX inﬂuences tumor expression of PR,
and this increase in PR is sustained during OVX-induced
weight gain. Estrogen-independent changes in PR are not
without precedent. In normal mammary epithelial cells, PR
expression has been showed in ER-negative cells (42). In
addition, IGF has been shown to downregulate PR expres-

sion in an ER-independent manner (43). Thus, while both
our data, and the work of others, support the possibility for
estrogen-independent increases in PR in tumors with obesity, local tissue measurements of estrogen that are focused
in tumor-bearing glands (44) or stromal vascular subfractions enriched with preadipocytes (45) may provide additional insight into estrogen's role in this effect.
High tumor PR expression, as observed in obese animals
with overfeeding, is associated with a glycolytic–lipogenic
phenotype typical of aggressive tumors (46, 47). Independent
of tumor type, the transformed state is characterized by the
ability of tumor cells to consume glucose at a higher rate
than normal cells. Much of this glucose is metabolized
through glycolysis to lactate, which occurs even under
conditions where oxygen concentrations are sufﬁcient to
support mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This attribute of tumors is generally referred to as the "Warburg
effect" (38, 47). Importantly, we show that the association
between tumor PR expression and a glycolytic–lipogenic
gene expression proﬁle is not limited to our rodent model,
as our analysis of clinical tumor datasets shows that PRþ
tumors from postmenopausal women also have a gene
expression proﬁle consistent with enhanced metabolic ﬂexibility. Data from both the Women's health initiative (WHI)
and the Nurses' health study further support progesterone
and/or PR's role in postmenopausal breast cancer. Postmenopausal women receiving the combination of estrogen and
progesterone, but not estrogen alone, have a reported 24%
increased risk of invasive breast cancer compared with
placebo (48), and PR, but not ER expression, has been
independently associated with BMI after menopause (49).
In addition to "priming" the tumor, obesity may also
"prime" the body to create an environment conducive to
tumor survival and growth during OVX-induced weight gain.
Obesity is commonly associated with metabolic dysregulation, reﬂected by insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and inﬂammation. Collectively, these
factors underlie the metabolically inﬂexible state associated
with obesity (9), in which there is little or no regulatory
response to common metabolic challenges (fasting, exercise,
and insulin infusions). We have also observed this impaired
response with obesity during sustained periods of overfeeding (10, 24, 25). The consequence of an impaired response to

women of all ages (n ¼ 1,434 tumors) are indicated.

OVX-induced overfeeding in the present study is that tumors
in obese animals would be bathed in high levels of nutrients
and growth factors known to promote tumor survival and
growth. For example, leptin, which has been shown to
activate proliferative pathways and upregulate expression
of ER-a (reviewed in ref. 17), has been implicated in the
pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer (48, 50). Our
data showed an increase in circulating leptin in obese rats
before OVX, and a trend for higher leptin during OVXinduced weight gain. Similarly, obese animals in this study
had higher insulin levels than lean animals, which has also
been associated with tumor promotion and increased cancer
risk (50). Our observations, however, likely underestimate
the tumorigenic potential of serum factors as blood was
collected in the latter part of the rats' light cycle, when food
consumption is lowest. Additional studies that obtain hormone, cytokine, and metabolite measurements during the

www.aacrjournals.org

dark cycle, when food consumption is greatest may reveal
more profound postprandial differences between lean and
obese animals and could speak to the differences in tumor
promotion we have reported.
Together with our previous work, these studies provide
evidence that obesity promotes breast cancer after menopause in two ways. First, by increasing tumor expression of
PR, obesity may make tumors better prepared to adapt to
the extreme metabolic state of excess nutrients and loss of
sex hormone production during menopause. Second, the
impaired metabolic state that is characteristic of obesity
decreases the ability for peripheral tissues to respond to an
inﬂux of excess energy, effectively providing tumors with
greater exposure and/or access to nutrients and circulating
factors that facilitate tumor survival and growth. These
effects of obesity likely converge during OVX/menopauseinduced weight gain to enhance tumor survival and growth,

despite the loss of ovarian sex hormone production. The
window of menopausal weight gain may, therefore, provide a
narrowed window during which insulin sensitizers and other
interventions that improve metabolic control could be highly efﬁcacious for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal breast cancer.
