BACKGROUND. The treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains a
challenge to the clinician despite recent advances. Many patients will either not
respond or will have only limited and/or brief responses to single-agent therapy.
Eventually, 30% of patients with MDS will progress and develop acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). New strategies are needed for these patients.

METHODS. 5-Azacytidine (AZA) and thalidomide were administered to 40 patients
with MDS or AML. AZA was given at a dose of 75 mg/m2 subcutaneously for 5 of

increasing to 100 mg per. Six patients had refractory anemia (RA), 2 patients had
patient had RAEB in transformation, 4 patients had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 1 patient had chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, and 16 patients had AML.
Thirty-six patients were evaluable for outcome.

RESULTS. A hematologic improvement (HI) was observed in 15 of 36 patients
(42%), stable disease was observed in 5 of 36 patients (14%), and 10 of 36
patients (28%) had disease progression. Six patients experienced complete remission (CR), 2 patients experienced an erythroid HI (HI-E), 1 patient experience an
absolute neutrophil count HI (HI-ANC), 5 patients experienced a platelet HI (HI-P),
and 7 patients had bilineage HI (HI-P and HI-ANC or an HI-E and HI-ANC).
It was noteworthy that 9 of 14 patients with AML had a history of prior MDS,
2 of 9 patients achieved a CR, 4 of 9 patients had HI (HI-E and bilineage HI),
and 1 patient had stable disease and was continuing treatment. DNA microarray
analysis of 8 responders and 4 nonresponders revealed that the genes associated
with cellular proliferation had higher expression levels in nonresponders.

CONCLUSIONS. The current findings indicated that a combination of low-dose
AZA and thalidomide was well tolerated and was effective therapy for the treatment of patients with MDS and AML arising from prior MDS. Cancer 2008;113:

T

he treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) of all subtypes was changed significantly when, in 2004, the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of the hypomethylating drug, 5-azacytidine (AZA). Until that time, palliative care or
bone marrow transplantation were the only options available to the
patient. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) AZA phase 3
randomized trial indicated that the overall response to the drug was
60%, and 66% of responders achieved transfusion independence.1
To our knowledge, to date, AZA has been the only drug shown to

alter the natural history of the disease.2 The drug
also has been investigated in the acute myeloid leukemias (AML), mostly for recurrent or refractory disease.3,4 The dose used in those early studies was
higher than that used in patients with MDS, and the
results were inconclusive. The studies suggested,
however, that a lower dose treatment may be beneficial for a subset of patients with AML. The precise
mechanism by which AZA affects a response in MDS
remains an open question. The drug is a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation and is presumed to reactivate silenced genes that are critical regulators of
growth, differentiation, angiogenesis, signaling, and
DNA repair. Although this may be the mechanism
underlying hematologic improvement (HI) in
patients with MDS, the reactivated genes specific to
MDS response remain unidentified.
It has been established that thalidomide, a drug
that once was prohibited for use because of its teratogenic effects, is an effective modulator of immune
functions, including the induction of T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor cell killing; it
has direct cytotoxicity effects (in multiple myeloma);
it interferes with autocrine and paracrine cytokine
functions involved in growth and inhibition of druginduced apoptosis (in myeloma); and it interferes
with the malignant cell microenvironment axis and
angiogenesis.5 Some of these immune phenomena
contribute to the evolution of MDS and prompted a
pilot study in 83 patients with MDS. A response to
thalidomide was observed in 16 patients, and 10
patients achieved transfusion independence. However, many patients could not tolerate the drug at
the dosages used in the study.6
Microarray expression analysis has been used
extensively to gain further biologic understanding of
malignant disease and as an aid to diagnosis and
prognosis. This type of analysis is especially difficult
in MDS, because multiple lineages codominate the
bone marrow. It is believed that the disease originates
in a stem cell that then differentiates into all of the
myeloid cell lineages. Prior attempts to purify the
stem cells for analysis have not been totally successful,
although useful biologic insight has been gained.
However, a 30-gene erythroid gene expression signature has been correlated with responsiveness to lenalidomide.7 The profile, indicative of a block in erythroid
differentiation, compliments the clinical response generated by the drug; improvement of anemia. The ability to identify which patients are less likely to respond
to a specific treatment is beneficial for patients with
MDS, in which drug-induced adverse side effects,
such as myelosuppression, can be deleterious in a
generally elderly population with comorbidities.

The treatment of MDS remains a challenge to
the clinician despite recent advances. Many patients
either will not respond or will have only limited and/
or brief responses to single-agent therapy. Eventually,
30% of patients with MDS will progress and develop
AML. New strategies are needed for these patients.
The objective of this pilot study was to determine
whether AZA combined with low-dose thalidomide
was safe and whether the combination was superior
to single-agent therapy in an outpatient setting for
patients with MDS or AML. In addition, a microarray
expression analysis was performed with pretreatment
mononuclear bone marrow cells in an attempt to
identify a profile that characterized which patients
will and will not respond to treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Forty patients with any French-American-British
(FAB) subtype of MDS as well as de novo or secondary AML were included in this study. Patients had
not received hematopoietic growth factors for 14
days before the pretreatment bone marrow aspirate.
AZA was given at a dose of 75 mg/m2 subcutaneously for 5 days every 28 days together with thalidomide starting at a dose of 50 mg per day and
increasing to 100 mg per day. Responses were evaluated by using the International Working Group (IWG)
2000 criteria.
Samples
Mononuclear cells in pretreatment bone marrow
aspirates from patients who were receiving AZA and
thalidomide were obtained after informed consent
according with Institutional Review Board-approved
protocols from the University of Massachusetts
Medical School. Cell pellets were dissolved in Trizol
(Invitrogen) and stored at 2808C. Samples from the
initial consecutive 28 patients who were enrolled in
the study were used for RNA isolation and microarray analysis. Complementary DNA (cDNA) samples
from these patients were hybridized to Affymetrix
HG-U133AA microarrays, and data were analyzed
using the GenePattern software package. Marker
genes (those genes that best differentiate between
different response types) were selected using the
ClassNeighbors algorithm with the signal-to-noise
metric.
Oligonucleotide Microarrays
Total RNA was purified from mononuclear cells using
Trizol (Invitrogen). The Ovation Biotin RNA Amplification and Labeling System (Nugen, Inc.) was used

1598

for the linear amplification of 20 ng total RNA. Fragmented, labeled cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix
oligonucleotide microarrays as described previously.8,9 Patient samples were profiled on HG_U133
Plus 2.0 microarrays; Raw expression values were
normalized using Robust multiarray averaging
(RMA).10

Marker Gene Selection
Raw gene expression values were preprocessed and
normalized using RMA.10 Genes with minimal variation across the dataset were excluded by discarding
genes for which the maximum gene expression value
divided by the minimum value across all samples
was <2 or if the difference between maximum and
minimum values was <100. Marker genes were
ranked using the signal-to-noise metric.9 For gene
x, the signal-to-noise metric, Sx, was calculated as
follows:
Sx ¼ ðl0  l1 Þ=ðr0 þ r1 Þ;
in which l0 and r0 are the mean and standard deviation for gene x in Class 0, and l1 and r1 are the respective values for Class 1. Statistical significance
was determined by random permutation of the class
labels.9 Significant markers were selected by using a
false discovery rate threshold of 0.1, which was computed using the procedure described by Benjamini
and Hochberg.11 Analyses were implemented with
the GenePattern software package12 using the ComparativeMarkerSelection module.13

RESULTS
In total, 40 patients with either MDS or AML were
recruited for this study (Table 1). The median patient
age was 72 years (range, 49-84 years). There were
24 men and 16 women. Six patients had a FAB classification of refractory anemia (RA), 2 patients had
RA with ringed sideroblasts, 10 patients had RA
with excess blasts (RAEB), 1 patient had RAEB in
transformation, 4 patients had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 1 patient had chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, and 16 patients had AML. Among the 24
patients with MDS, 2 patients had low International
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores, 9 patients
had intermediate-1 (Int-1) scores, 9 patients had
intermediate-2 (Int-2) scores, 3 patients had high
scores, and 1 patient had an unclassified score
(Table 1). Eighteen patients had a normal cytogenetic
analysis.

Clinical Responses by IWG Criteria
Fourteen patients (35%) were removed from study
because of disease progression (10 patients), declined
therapy (1 patient), or death within 1 cycle of therapy (3 patients). There were 36 patients who could
be evaluated for response (Table 2). Of these 36
patients, 21 (58%) had a response to treatment, and
15 (42%) did not (45 patients had stable disease, and
10 patients had disease progression) according to
IWG criteria. In total, 6 patients (17%) experienced a
complete remission (CR), including 2 patients with
MDS and 4 patients with AML. Seven patients had a
bilineage response, and 8 patients had a monolineage response. Two patients (6%) experienced an erythroid hematologic improvement (HI-E), 1 patient
(3%) experienced an absolute neutrophil count HI
(HI-ANC), 5 patients (14%) experienced a platelet HI
(HI-P), and 7 patients (19%) had bilineage HI (HI-P
and HI-ANC or HI-E and HI-ANC) (Table 2).
Response in AML Patients
Of the 14 patients with AML, 5 patients (36%) left
the study with disease progression, 1 patient (7%)
had stable disease, and 8 patients (58%) responded
with 4 CRs (29%), 3 bilineage HIs (22%), and 1 HI-E
(7%) (Table 3). It is noteworthy that, of the 9 patients
with AML who had a history of prior MDS (Table 3),
2 patients (22%) achieved a CR, 3 patients (33%) had
bilineage HI, 1 patient (11%) had HI-E, and 1 patient
(11%) had stable disease. Among the 5 patients with
de novo AML, 2 patients (40%) experienced a CR,
and 3 patients (60%) demonstrated evidence of disease progression.
Survival
The median survival for all patients was 17.8 months.
For patients with MDS, the median survival was 18.5
months; and, for patients with AML, the median survival was 13.2 months (Fig. 1). Eleven patients,
including 3 patients with AML, were alive at the close
of the study. Adverse events generally were mild
(grade 1 and 2) and are listed in Table 4.
DNA Microarray Analysis
Total RNA was available from 8 patients who
responded and from 4 patients with resistant disease
(RD). Although the pattern in the responding group
was somewhat heterogeneous, it was strikingly homogeneous for those with RD (Fig. 2). Most noteworthy, 21 of the 40 marker genes that were
overexpressed (genes in red in Fig. 2 under the RD
columns) in the resistant group were associated
directly with cellular proliferation. These genes can
be divided functionally into 3 groups. Group I (cell

fore, to improve the response rate in patients with
MDS, it was considered reasonable to administer a
combination of 2 agents with demonstrated efficacy
in this disease and that act preferably through different mechanisms on the clonal population of cells.
MDS is a complex and heterogeneous disease in
which the bone marrow microenvironment plays an
important role in perpetuating the malignant clone.
We combined 2 therapeutic agents, both of which
target the bone marrow microenvironment as well as
the cell. AZA is a prodrug with activity exerted
through RNA and DNA. By binding to RNA, it causes
inhibition of protein synthesis and, because these
include several proinflammatory cytokines, the drug
has a considerable effect on the bone marrow microenvironment. After conversion into its active form of
decitabine, the drug acts by binding to the DNA with
additional plieotropic effects on the MDS cells. These
include cytotoxicity (especially in high doses), hypomethylation and gene reactivation (lower doses), inhibition of the enzyme methyl transferase, and
differentiation (demonstrated for erythroleukemia
cells).
Thalidomide, conversely, has anticytokine (especially antitumor necrosis factor), antiangiogenic, and
immune-modulatory activity (especially differentiation of monocytes into NK and CD8-positive T cells,
thereby enhancing autologous tumor response).
Thus, thalidomide mainly targets the components of

AZA Plus Thalidomide for MDS and AML/Raza et al

the bone marrow microenvironment. Combining thalidomide with AZA provides the potential to impact
both ‘seed and soil.’ We previously published data on
the combination of thalidomide with several agents,
including amifostine, topotecan, etanercept, and arsenic trioxide. In each case, we demonstrated that
combination therapy was more effective than singleagent therapy both for response and for the quality/
duration of that response. In fact, the best survival
we identified in an analysis of approximately 250
patients with MDS who were treated with thalidomide either alone or in combination, was observed
in a trial of thalidomide and etanercept (Enbrel) in
which no patient who responded had developed a recurrence almost 3 years later.14 Our experience,
therefore, supported the combination of AZA with
thalidomide as potentially useful in the treatment of
all types of MDS and in patients with AML who have
a history of prior MDS or who cannot receive conventional induction therapy.
In the current study, we commenced treatment
with AZA at a dose of 75 mg/m2 every day for 5 days
given every 4 weeks and thalidomide at a dose of 50
mg per day orally. On Day 8, the thalidomide dose
was increased to 100 mg daily as tolerated. Patients
with both MDS and AML were treated, and the
results were encouraging, because 61% of patients
had a response, including a 19% CR rate. In total, 40
patients were registered on the trial, but only 36
patients were evaluable for response. Of 14 patients
with AML, 8 patients responded, 4 with a CR and 4
with a partial response. Of 22 patients with MDS (10
had higher risk IPSS scores and 11 had lower risk
IPSS scores), 2 patients achieved CR, and 11 patients
showed HI.
The results of the current study, albeit in a small
cohort, established some important points: The
drugs were tolerated well without additive toxicity.
The treatment, by and large, was administered as
outpatient therapy. Efficacy in high-risk MDS and
AML patients was at least as good as 7 days of AZA
alone. And, finally, survival after 1 year of treatment
with AZA followed by maintenance with thalidomide
appeared to be comparable to the survival of patients
who were treated continuously with AZA in the
phase 3 randomized survival study1 and appeared to
be better than the survival in the conventional care
arm of that study. The current study results cannot
be compared with the AZA survival trial, because
that trial only included higher risk patients.2
Although the sample size was small, gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays identified a
molecular signature that appears to distinguish
between patients who had some response (n 5 8)

1603

and patients who manifested RD (n 5 4). Of the 40
top marker genes that were overexpressed in the RD
group, 21 are associated directly with cellular proliferation and can be divided functionally into 3
groups. Group I consists of 9 genes that have proteins located in the nucleus and that play a role in
either the mitotic process or in the control of transition from the G1/S-phase to the G2/M-phase. Group
II is comprised of 5 genes with proteins that are part
of the DNA replication/repair pathway. Group III
contains 7 genes with proteins that participate in
chromatin and spindle structure. Aberrant expression
and/or mutations in the majority of these genes have
been identified in multiple malignant diseases. In
general, the overexpression of these genes indicates
that the cells are in a state of rapid proliferation, suggesting a possible underlying cause for the drug resistance observed in these patients. These results are
especially striking because the treatment regimen
consisted of a combination of 2 drugs, AZA and thalidomide, which purportedly act through different
mechanisms. The finding that the RD patients
appear to share a molecular signature, which also is
consistent with a demonstrated mechanism of cell
cycle resistance, is all the more promising for the
future clinical usefulness of this methodology.
