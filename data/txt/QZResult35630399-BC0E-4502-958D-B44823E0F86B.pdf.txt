BACKGROUND. Tumors with multidrug resistance (MDR) frequently up-regulate
efflux proteins, including MDR-associated protein (MRP-1) and P-glycoprotein
(Pgp). MDR represents an obstacle to successful chemotherapy treatment and is
reversible in Pgp- or MRP-1-expressing cells by the inhibitor VX-710. A Phase II
study was designed to evaluate VX-710 in combination with doxorubicin and vincristine in patients with sensitive, recurrent small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

METHODS. Eligible patients had recurrent SCLC after a response to first-line
chemotherapy. Stage 1 safety evaluation was completed with planned expansion
if 9 responses were confirmed in the first 35 patients. Patients were treated every

mall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive form of lung cancer, and the mainstay of treatment for SCLC is chemotherapy.
However, despite initial high susceptibility to antiproliferative therapy (response rates of 60–80%1,2), recurrences are common, and resistance to subsequent therapies is frequent. Chemotherapy for
patients who develop recurrent SCLC is less effective than the initial
chemotherapy; the response rate with the approved second-line
therapy, topotecan, is only 22%.1 The duration of response in second-line therapy is shorter than in first-line therapy and produces a
median survival of 6 months.2 Therefore, alternative strategies are

needed to identify treatments that can overcome the
development of resistance to improve outcomes for
patients with recurrent SCLC.
A number of resistance mechanisms have been
identified in SCLC, including up-regulated expression
of genes involved in multidrug resistance (MDR).
MDR factors include genes encoding for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the MDR-associated protein (MRP-1),
both of which prevent accumulation of some chemotherapeutic agents through adenosine triphosphate-dependent transport out of cells.
Several studies have evaluated the expression of
P-gp and MRP-1 in drug-resistant SCLC cell lines
and tumor specimens. The majority of studies of Pgp and MRP-1 expression have demonstrated a correlation between increased expression and resistance
to chemotherapy.3–5 It is noteworthy that this correlation appears to be specific to P-gp and MRP-1
expression and not to other efflux transporters. One
study analyzed biopsy specimens of 40 patients with
SCLC prior to chemotherapy for immunohistochemical evidence of P-gp and MRP-1.6 None of the
patients who had a clinical response to 6 cycles of
cisplatin and etoposide showed evidence of either Pgp or MRP protein detected by immunohistochemistry, whereas 12 of 20 patients with stable or progressive disease after the same treatment expressed both
proteins (P < .01).
Thus, an agent that modifies MDR through P-gp
or MRP-1 could provide substantial clinical benefit
for patients with SCLC who are treated with chemotherapy. Several different MDR inhibitors have been
developed, but most are specific for a particular
MDR transport protein (reviewed by Robert, 19986
and Tan et al., 20007). For example, PSC833 (Valspodar) interacts specifically with P-gp. However,
multiple proteins have been implicated in MDR,
which may limit the efficacy of a highly specific inhibitor. VX-710 (biricodar, INCEL) is an agent that
binds directly to both P-gp and MRP-1. The binding
of biricodar to P-gp and MRP-1 inhibits their pump
efflux activity and increases intracellular accumulation and retention of cytotoxic agents. VX-710
restored drug sensitivity to drug-selected as well as
combinational DNA-transfected cell lines at levels
from 1 lm to 5 lm for all MDR class cytotoxic drugs
tested (doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide, paclitaxel, and colchicine).9
A Phase I study of VX-710 plus doxorubicin
established the safety and pharmacokinetics of VX710 administered by continuous intravenous infusion
for 96 hours in combination with intravenous bolus
doxorubicin at 45 mg/m2. VX-710 blood steady-state
concentrations of 10 lM were sustained at a dosage

925

of 120 mg/m2 per hour, and VX-710 had no apparent
effect on doxorubicin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.8
Therefore, we conducted a multicenter, openlabel, Phase II study to evaluate VX-710 plus doxorubicin and vincristine in patients with SCLC who had
developed recurrent disease after achieving a response to first-line therapy. Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin (CAV) historically was the
regimen of choice for SCLC before the advent of etoposide and platinum combinations. In a key randomized trial of patients with previously treated SCLC,
CAV was compared with topotecan9 in patients with
chemotherapy-sensitive, recurrent SCLC (>60 days
from the last chemotherapy to disease progression).
The outcome of patients who received CAV was similar in efficacy to that of patients who received topotecan with an 18% response rate, a 12-week time
to progression (TTP), and a 6-month median survival. In selecting a regimen to use with VX710,
the decision to omit cyclophosphamide was based
on the fact that it is unaffected by MDR efflux
pumps.
The doses of doxorubicin and vincristine were
chosen to be similar to those used in the CAV regimen. The initial cohort planned for a half dose of
vincristine to establish the safety of the combination
of vincristine and VX-710. Like in previous studies,
the VX-710 infusion was initiated prior to administration of the chemotherapy drugs to inhibit P-gp and
MDR and to increase cellular retention of the subsequent chemotherapy, and the infusion was continued
for 72 hours to sustain inhibition through 2 to 3 halflives of doxorubicin and vincristine.
A subset of patients underwent imaging with
99m
Tc-sestamibi before and after their first dose of
VX-710 as a potential tool for measuring the impact
of MDR inhibition. 99mTc-sestamibi is a transport
substrate for P-gp and MRP-1.10,11 VX-710 and other
MDR inhibitors restore 99mTc-sestamibi uptake and
retention in P-gp and MRP-1 expressing cells in
vitro.12 Studies in patients with breast cancer and
lung cancer have reported higher retention of 99mTcsestamibi in tumors that expressed low levels of
P-gp. In contrast, a higher 99mTc-sestamibi wash-out
rate and reduced retention were noted in lesions that
expressed high levels of P-gp.13–15 Increased washout and poor retention appeared to correlate with a
poor treatment response.
The objectives of the current study were 1) to establish the safety of VX-710 when used in combination with doxorubicin and vincristine in patients
with SCLC; 2) to establish the ability of VX-710, given
in combination with doxorubicin and vincristine, to

improve the response rate to chemotherapy in
patients with SCLC who developed recurrent disease
on first-line therapy; and 3) to evaluate the MDR
profile of patients by analyzing biopsy specimens for
the expression of P-gp and MRP and using functional
imaging of tumors with 99mTc-sestamibi.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Patients who were eligible for this study were aged
18 years and had histologically confirmed SCLC
and documented progressive disease (new lesions
and/or increase in size of existing lesions) after firstline chemotherapy. No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen was allowed. Patients were required to
have had an objective response to initial chemotherapy treatment and then a recurrence >60 days after
the last day of first-line chemotherapy administration. Patients were required to have bidimensionally
measurable disease, which was defined by 1
lesion(s) that measured 1 3 1 cm. Patients needed
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status 2. Prior to entry on the study, required laboratory values included an absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) 1500 cells/lL, a platelet count 100,000
cells/lL, bilirubin and serum creatinine levels within
normal limits, an aspartate aminotransferase level
2 times the upper limit of normal, and a cardiac
ejection fraction >45% determined by multiple-gated
acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram.
Patients with brain metastases had to have clinically
controlled neurologic symptoms, which we defined
as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 30 days of stable neurologic function and
no evidence of central nervous system disease progression.
Exclusion criteria included prior radiation therapy to >50% of bone marrow, concurrent serious
infections, any unstable or serious concurrent medical condition, brain or bone metastases as the only
measurable site of disease recurrence, radiation therapy within the previous 30 days, a history of prior
cancer (except patients who had received adequate
treatment for basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
skin cancer, or any in situ carcinoma) unless they
were disease-free for 5 years, and a first-line chemotherapy regimen that included doxorubicin or vincristine. Informed consent was obtained according to
local Institutional Review Board requirements.
Study Design
This was an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter
study that was conducted in 2 stages with planned

interim and final analyses. The sample sizes of 35
evaluable patients for the interim analysis and the
potential for 92 additional evaluable patients for the
final analysis were based on assumed response rates
of 21% for the null hypothesis. The sample size to
detect a response rate of 36% for the alternative hypothesis (or a 75% relative improvement from standard treatment) was calculated with 90% power at a
5% type I significance level. The null hypothesis rate
was selected to be intermediate between the secondline therapy response rate observed for patients who
were treated with CAV (17.3%) and the initially
reported response rate for topotecan (24.3%).9 The
study was to continue to the second stage if the interim analysis identified 9 confirmed responses
among these first 35 evaluable patients.
VX-710 was given by continuous intravenous
infusion (IV) for 72 hours at a dose of 120 mg/m2
per hour, as described previously.16 Doxorubicin (45
mg/m2) and vincristine (0.7 mg/m2 or 1.4 mg/m2)
were given as IV bolus injections 4 hours after the
start of the VX-710 infusion. The regimen was to be
repeated every 21 days until evidence of disease progression, intolerable adverse events (AEs), or withdrawal of patient consent. Patients were to receive
up to 6 cycles of treatment.
The first 3 patients were treated with a half dose
of vincristine (0.7 mg/m2) to assess toxicity. The incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in these
patients within the first cycle was used to determine
whether the vincristine dose could be increased to
the full dose (1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg).
DLT was defined as Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicities (according to World Health Organization
[WHO] toxicity criteria); ANC <500 cells/lL for >7
days, febrile neutropenia, platelets <20,000 cells/lL,
or grade 3 or 4 nausea and/or vomiting despite
aggressive antiemetic treatment.
None of the first 3 patients had a DLT; therefore,
the next 3 patients were treated with a full dose of
vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 or a maximum of 2.0 mg).
Subsequently, an additional 33 patients were treated
with full-dose vincristine in the first stage of the
study. Although the original study plan was to analyze only those patients who received full-dose vincristine, the patients who received half-dose
vincristine ultimately were included in the efficacy
analysis for the most conservative assessment of
antitumor activity.
After 15 patients had been enrolled, the study
was modified to include administration of prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at
5 lg/kg per day on Days 6 through 13 of each treatment cycle or prophylactic ciprofloxacin at 500 mg

Multidrug Resistance Inhibitor in SCLC/Gandhi et al.

twice daily on Days 7 through 17 of each treatment
cycle to prevent serious neutropenic infection. This
modification was based on grade 4 neutropenia,
which was noted during Cycle 1 in 58% of the first
15 patients enrolled, and 2 patient deaths from febrile neutropenia.
After 36 patients had been enrolled in the first
stage of the study, an interim analysis was conducted. Enrollment in the study was stopped prior to
Stage 2 based on <9 responses noted in Stage 1.

Pretreatment and Follow-up Evaluations
Seventeen patients had diagnostic biopsy samples
that were sent to IMPATH, Inc., where immunostaining was performed. After optimization of assay conditions using 2 different antibodies to each protein, 1
antibody for each was chosen for patient samples in
the study. Clone C219, immunoglobulin G2A (IgG2A)
(8710-01, Signet Laboratories, Inc.) was used to
detect Pgp expression; and clone MRP-r1, IgG
(G8760-01; Signet Laboratories, Inc.) was used to
detect MRP expression. Expression was analyzed in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens for the
site of reactivity, the degree of reactivity, and staining
intensity (0–3þ). Intensity was compared in specimens that expressed either protein in >20% of tumor
cells by using human liver tissue as a positive control.
Patient history, physical examination, assessment
of baseline symptoms, an electrocardiogram, and
routine laboratory studies, including a pregnancy test
for women of childbearing potential, were required
within 2 weeks before study registration. Baseline tumor measurements were obtained by computerized
tomography (CT) within 2 weeks before study entry.
At some centers, 99mTc-sestamibi scans and MUGA/
echocardiograms were performed within 2 weeks
before study entry and on Day 3 of Cycle 1. Patients
underwent a history and physical examination with
laboratory tests in each cycle. Complete blood counts
were obtained before the start of each cycle, at Days
10 thorough 14, and at Day 22. Tumor measurements
were obtained after the second, fourth, and sixth
cycles.
Response Criteria and Endpoints
Patients were considered evaluable for response
assessment using WHO criteria17 if they completed
at 1 cycle. 99mTc-sestamibi retention was used as a
surrogate marker for enhanced retention of cytotoxic
agents, as described previously.8 The image analysis
was performed during baseline screening (within 2
weeks of starting study therapy) and on Day 3 (from
48 to 72 hours after initiation of the VX-710 infusion)

of Cycle 1. The images were evaluated by a blinded
reviewer to determine the uptake and retention
within the liver, an organ that constitutively
expresses both P-gp and MRP-1; in the heart as a reference negative value; and in imageable tumor
lesions. A ratio of 99mTc-sestamibi retention in the
target tissue compared with background was determined in scans that were acquired during baseline
screening and on Day 3 of Cycle 1.
Blood samples were collected from the first 13
patients, and vincristine levels were measured at successive time points after administration of the drug
(1 minute, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8
hours, and 24 hours). However, pharmacokinetic
analyses were not performed in this study, because
vincristine levels were undetectable after 30 minutes
in all of the 13 patients sampled using high-performance liquid chromatography. It is unclear whether
this was caused by insensitivity of the assay in
humans, but preclinical studies in dogs had shown
no effect of VX-710 on the pharmacokinetics of vincristine and no effect on associated hematologic,
neurologic, or other toxicities.

RESULTS
Patients

with other studies of patients with SCLC. Notably,
the majority of patients had received prior radiation
in addition to chemotherapy.
The 36 patients received a total of 108 treatment
cycles of treatment. The mean dose per cycle was
99% of the maximum prescribed dose for VX-710,
97% for doxorubicin, and 95% for vincristine. The
median number of cycles per patient was 2 (range,
1–8 cycles).
The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were progression of SCLC (16 patients) or
AEs (6 patients). Four additional patients died on
study, and 6 patients completed all planned cycles.
The 4 remaining patients were discontinued because
of patient or physician preference.

Safety and Tolerability
All 36 patients were assessable for safety. Although
all patients reported at 1 AE, most were considered
mild to moderate in severity (grades 1 and 2). The
most frequently reported AE was neutropenia, which
occurred in 69% of patients (Table 2). Of 9 patients
(25%) with grade 4 neutropenia, 2 patients died of
complications related to neutropenic infection. Other
hematologic toxicities also were significant. Fortytwo percent of patients developed grade 1 to 3 anemia, and 28% of patients experienced thrombocytopenia, with 80% of those experiencing grade 3 or 4
toxicity. However, no significant bleeding events
occurred. There were no significant changes from
baseline for other laboratory parameters.
Notable improvements in ANC values and the
incidence of severe hematologic toxicity were
observed among patients who were enrolled after the
protocol was amended to require prophylactic use of
G-CSF or ciprofloxacin beginning with Cycle 1 of
study treatment. Only 38% of patients experienced
grade 4 neutropenia in Cycle 1 after the amendment
requiring prophylaxis, compared with 58% of
patients who were enrolled prior to the amendment.
In subsequent cycles, grade 4 neutropenia was
reduced from 30% to 20%. After the amendment, no
further deaths occurred from febrile neutropenia.

The most frequently reported nonhematologic
AEs (>30% overall incidence) (Table 3) were asthenia
(75%), nausea (53%); vomiting (44%); anorexia (42%);
alopecia (39%); back pain, dyspnea, and constipation
(36% each); arthralgias/myalgias and parasthesia
(33% each); and diarrhea (31%). Nonhematologic AEs
that were considered likely to be related to treatment
included asthenia (53%), nausea (50%), constipation
(44%), alopecia (42%), vomiting (39%), and anorexia
(33%).
Three patients had >10% absolute decreases
from baseline in their MUGA scan. Two of those
decreases were considered to be related to study
medication, and 1 decrease resulted in discontinuation from the study. Physical examination results and
vital signs did not change substantially during the
study.
In total, 17 patients experienced 20 life-threatening
(grade 4) AEs, with neutropenia being the most predominant (12 patients). Two patients experienced
grade 4 dyspnea. Other reported severe AEs that
were not related clearly to study drug included 1
patient with pericardial effusion and tamponade, 2
patients with pulmonary emboli, and 1 patient with
severe herpes zoster.
In addition to the 2 deaths on study because of
neutropenic complications, 2 other patients died on
study of disease progression, and 4 patients died
within 30 days after study termination. Three of
those 4 deaths were caused by disease progression,
and the fourth death was caused by an infection that
was not related to the study drug.

Efficacy
Of the 36 treated patients, 32 were considered evaluable for response. Four patients had no response
data (1 patient withdrew consent during Cycle 1,
1 patient withdrew because of a severe AE during
Cycle 1, and 2 patients died before the completion of
Cycle 1 from infectious complications).
In total, 7 of 36 total patients (19%) achieved a
confirmed partial response (PR) at the time of termination, which translates to 22% of evaluable patients
(7 of 32 patients). Four of the PRs were confirmed by
independent radiology review, and 3 were determined
by radiology review at the study center (Table 4).
One of the 7 patients who achieved a PR had a brain
metastasis detected by MRI at study termination; the
other 6 patients completed study treatment with a
continuing response. Because patients’ responses were
censored at that time, an accurate calculation of response duration was not possible. However, 1 patient
who completed 2 additional cycles (optional under
study guidelines) had a response that was sustained
for 3 years.
Four additional patients had notable tumor shrinkage at 1 measurement time point. Three patients had
unconfirmed responses, with tumor measurements decreasing 80% to 90% after the Cycle 2 assessment.
These 3 patients discontinued study treatment and did
not have a subsequent confirmatory response assessment. One patient had 57% tumor shrinkage at the
Cycle 2 assessment but had progressive disease at
study termination. Four patients ended treatment with
stable disease. Eighteen patients (56%) had disease
progression, and the median TTP for those patients
was 42 days.
Fifteen patients were evaluated by using 99mTcsestamibi retention measured with planar and singlephoton emission CT imaging. Scans were compared
before treatment (during baseline screening) and on
Day 3 of Cycle 1. Compared with baseline values, the

administration of VX-710 increased retention of
Tc-sestamibi in the liver by 1.3- to 3.2-fold in 10
of 15 patients. Five patients had no increase in
99m
Tc-sestamibi liver retention. Within tumor tissue,
retention of 99mTc-sestamibi was increased for only 1
patient (by 1.4-fold); 13 patients had no increase,
and 1 patient had no imaging data collected on Day 3.
Diagnostic biopsy specimens were obtained for
20 of the 36 patients enrolled on the study. The tumor cells in diagnostic specimens rarely expressed Pgp (3 of 20 patients; 15%). In contrast, 12 of 20
patients (60%) had detectable MRP-1 by immunohistochemistry. One patient expressed both proteins at
moderate levels. These expression frequencies are
similar to those reported in other studies4,5,18; however, unlike those studies, there was no clear correlation with expression of either protein in the current
study and response to treatment. Among the 10
responders (7 confirmed and 3 unconfirmed), 2
patients had 1þ expression of P-gp, and 1 patient
had 1þ expression of MRP: The remaining patients
did not express either protein. Whether these proteins were up-regulated with the development of resistance to first-line treatment in unknown, because
no patients consented to repeat biopsies prior to
treatment with VX-710.
In total, 21 patients were seen at least once during the long-term follow-up period, which ranged
from 0 months to 30 months. The median survival
was 6 months (95% confidence interval, 4–7 months)
(see Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
The incidence and severity of the neutropenia
observed in this study were similar to results from a

930

CANCER

study that used CAV to treat patients with recurrent
SCLC.9 Grade 4 neutropenia was experienced by
71.7% of patients who received with CAV and in
51.4% of cycles with no treatment-related deaths. In
addition, 4.8% of patients and 1.4% of cycles of CAV
were associated with infection.13
However, the overall incidence of grade 4 neutropenia (with or without prophylactic G-CSF) that we
observed with the VX-710 plus doxorubicin/vincristine combination was greater than expected based
on results from a Phase I study. In that study, among
11 patients who received VX-710 120 mg/m2 per
hour with doxorubicin 45 mg/m2, only 17% experienced grade 4 neutropenia.8
The addition of vincristine to the same VX-710/
doxorubicin dose combination appeared to increase
myelosuppression markedly in the current study.
Vincristine pharmacokinetics data could not be evaluated effectively because of the inability to detect
vincristine after 30 minutes in any of the patients
tested. Therefore, it was not possible to determine
whether a pharmacokinetic interaction could contribute, at least in part, to the increase in myelosuppression observed. Increased myelosuppression has
been observed in other Phase II studies with VX-710,
even after dose adjustments for pharmacokinetic
interactions. Phase II studies with VX-710 in combination with paclitaxel for advanced breast cancer or
ovarian cancer refractory to paclitaxel reported a
40% and 47% incidence of grade 4 neutropenia,
respectively.19
An alternative explanation for the current observations is that CD34-positive myeloid precursor cells
express P-gp, and it is possible that increased vincristine and doxorubicin retention in the presence of
VX-710 may be a mechanism-based pharmacodynamic
effect that contributes to myelosuppression.20–22 Finally,
prior treatment history may have been a factor in the
increased myelosuppression and clinical consequences for some patients on this study. Seventy-five
percent of patients had received previous mediastinal
radiation and, thus, began the study with potentially
compromised bone marrow. This rate is higher than
previous the rate reported in Phase II studies of CAV
and topotecan, in which radiation frequency ranged
from 36% to 62%3,18; and it presumably is higher
than the rate reported from a Phase I study of VX710 and doxorubicin, which included multiple cancer
types.12
Although this trial was not designed as a dosefinding study for the combination of doxorubicin,
vincristine, and VX-710, an initial cohort of 3
patients was treated with half-dose vincristine. These
patients had DLTs monitored for only 1 cycle, and

no toxicities were noted. In retrospect, a Phase I
component that incorporated more extensive DLT
monitoring may have provided useful information
about the hematologic toxicities that we observed in
this study prior to implementing an amendment
that required neutropenia prophylaxis. Without this
prophylaxis, the combination could not be considered a safe regimen. After implementing this amendment, 4 of 21 patients (19%) did not complete >2
cycles because of treatment-related toxicities. This
number is higher than the numbers reported from a
study that compared topotecan with CAV11 but is
comparable to the numbers reported from a recent
study of currently used regimens in first-line
therapy.23
The confirmed response rate in the current study
of 19% was similar to the reported response rates to
topotecan (24%) and CAV (18%) in a randomized
study with similar inclusion criteria that enrolled
patients with SCLC.3 Furthermore, the majority of
these responses were sustained throughout the duration of treatment, with 1 patient showing a prolonged response of 3 years. The median survival in
this population of 6 months was nearly identical to
the median survival reported for both topotecan and
CAV.1,9
However, the proposed hypothesis for this study
was that VX-710 would improve upon the objective
response rate to the vincristine/doxorubicin combination. Several factors may have affected the effective inhibition of these MDR targets by VX-710. The
proportion of diagnostic biopsy specimens that
expressed P-gp was low (15%), and no specimens
expressed high levels of P-gp (3þ). MRP-1 expression
was more frequent (60%), but only 10% of specimens
expressed MRP-1 at high levels. Of the patients who
responded, only 30% had any expression of either
protein, and none had expression at a high level.
Because pre-VX-710 biopsies were not available from
patients in this study, the change in expression levels
of P-gp and MRP-1 after first-line therapy could not
be determined, which would have been more informative about the association of those levels with
response to VX-710. In the absence of significantly
up-regulated expression of MDR proteins, the addition of VX-710 would not necessarily be expected to
improve the response rate to doxorubicin and vincristine.
Functional tumor imaging with 99mTc-sestamibi
was another strategy we examined in this study to
identify tumor lesions with a drug-accumulation
defect, although only some centers were able to perform this study. The absence of significant 99mTcsestamibi uptake in tumor tissue from patients in

Multidrug Resistance Inhibitor in SCLC/Gandhi et al.

this study contrasts with Phase I data, in which a
20% to 60% increase in tumor retention of 99mTc-sestamibi was observed in 8 patients with imageable
tumors given VX-710 at a similar dose and infusion
schedule.10 The reason for the difference in results
from the 2 studies with VX-710 are not clear. In contrast to previous studies that used this imaging modality in other solid tumors,16–18 a study of 23
patients with lung cancer (9 patients with SCLC and
15 patients with non-SCLC) showed no significant
correlation between the percent retention of 99mTcsestamibi and chemotherapeutic response,24 suggesting that the location of the tumor, local VX-710 tissue
concentrations, or vascularity of the tumor all may
affect the utility of 99mTc-sestamibi imaging. In addition, it is unknown how the levels of P-gp and MRP1 in this study compared with the levels reported
from the Phase I study, which included multiple tumor types. The lack of 99mTc-sestamibi uptake may
reflect low MDR protein expression and, thus, may
be the cause of the lack of efficacy observed with
VX-710; however, because there were some therapeutic responses, alternatively, it may be an inappropriate biomarker in this setting.
One concern about the use of MDR inhibition in
general is the effect of inhibiting only 1 or even 2
MDR modulators when tumors may express multiple
MDR transporters with overlapping activities (for
review, see Donnenberg and Donnenberg, 200525).
Although VX-710 inhibits both P-gp and MRP, the
expression of P-gp in SCLC is less common compared with the expression of MRP, as confirmed in
this study. If alternative transporters are expressed in
recurrent SCLC, then the MDR phenotype still may
be unaffected despite the effective inhibition of P-gp
and MRP-1 by VX-710.
In conclusion, although data suggest that acquired expression of P-gp or MRP1 may be associated with a poor response of SCLC to second-line
therapy, the addition of VX-710 to doxorubicin and
vincristine did not improve the response rate in this
small study and was associated with significant hematologic toxicity. Although 7 of 36 total patients
had PRs, we believed it was unlikely that 2 additional
responses would be seen in 3 more evaluable
patients to achieve the required 9 of 35 responses
required to continue the study. Thus, based on the
accumulated data, the study was stopped early.
Although no further development is planned currently for this particular molecule, future evaluation
of MDR inhibitors in SCLC should incorporate prestudy biopsies for analysis of MDR transporter
expression to select patients who have a greater
probability of achieving clinical benefit.
