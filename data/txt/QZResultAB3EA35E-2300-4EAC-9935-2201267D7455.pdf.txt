Abstract
One classical feature of cancer cells is their metabolic acquisition of a highly glycolytic phenotype. Carbon
monoxide (CO), one of the products of the cytoprotective molecule heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in cancer cells, has
been implicated in carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance. However, the functional contributions of CO and HO-1
to these processes are poorly deﬁned. In human prostate cancers, we found that HO-1 was nuclear localized in
malignant cells, with low enzymatic activity in moderately differentiated tumors correlating with relatively worse
clinical outcomes. Exposure to CO sensitized prostate cancer cells but not normal cells to chemotherapy, with
growth arrest and apoptosis induced in vivo in part through mitotic catastrophe. CO targeted mitochondria activity
in cancer cells as evidenced by higher oxygen consumption, free radical generation, and mitochondrial collapse.
Collectively, our ﬁndings indicated that CO transiently induces an anti-Warburg effect by rapidly fueling cancer cell
bioenergetics, ultimately resulting in metabolic exhaustion. Cancer Res; 73(23); 7009–21. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Epithelial cancers, including prostate, breast, and lung cancer, are still leading causes of deaths in the United States and
treatment for advanced disease is limited (1). A standard of
ﬁrst-line care for advanced and metastatic cancers remains
chemotherapy such as taxols, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (2).
Rapid proliferation of primary tumor and cancer cell survival
during spread to distant organs as well as resistance to
treatment are possible in part due to the remarkable metabolic
adaptation known as the Warburg effect (3). The Warburg
effect is characterized by increased glucose uptake and elevated glycolysis with a limited oxygen consumption rate (OCR)
resulting in lactic acid fermentation (4). High rates of energy
consuming processes including protein, DNA, and fatty acid
synthesis in cancer cells is often accompanied by an increased
oxidative state of dysfunctional mitochondria (5). The promoAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Surgery, Transplant Institute,

tion of tumor growth requires, in part, a selection of cancer
cells with repressed mitochondrial activity and biogenesis (6).
Defects in mitochondrial ROS metabolism from electron transport chains in cancer cells have been linked directly to
increased cancer cell glucose metabolism. The free radical
theory of cancer implicates ROS as a principal cause of early
mutations as well as being involved in the response to treatment (7–11).
Heme oxygenases (HO), which degrade heme to biliverdin,
carbon monoxide (CO), and iron, are critical modulators of
metabolism and mitochondrial activity. Expression of HO-1,
the stress-inducible isoform, is strictly regulated, whereas HO2 is ubiquitously expressed primarily in brain and testes. Their
functional role in cancer has not been clearly elucidated and
remains controversial. HO-1 can impart potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects via antioxidant mechanisms as
shown in breast and lung cancer cell lines (12, 13). Better
survival rates were observed in patients with colorectal cancer
where HO-1 expression correlated with lower rates of lymphatic tumor invasion. In contrast, overexpression of HO-1
has been shown to accelerate pancreatic cancer aggressiveness
by increasing tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis (14).
Similar effects were observed in melanoma (15), gastric (16),
and renal cancers (17). In patients with prostate cancer, HO-1 is
localized in the nucleus and correlated with cancer progression
(18). Nuclear HO-1 was also detected in head and neck squamous carcinomas and associated with tumor progression (19).
Recently, nuclear HO-1 has been linked to resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (20). Further evidence for
HO-1 in cancer incidence presides in the identiﬁcation of a GT
length polymorphism of the HO-1 promoter that is highly
correlative with cancer severity (21). Individuals with long GT
repeats in the HO-1 promoter and associated low expression of

HO-1 showed a higher frequency of gastric or lung adenocarcinoma and oral squamous cancer versus those with short GT
repeats and higher HO-1 expression (22). CO, biliverdin, bilirubin as well as iron and ferritin serve as potential modulators
of tumorigenesis however all have been minimally studied in
cancer (23).
In the present studies, we ﬁrst conducted a detailed analysis
of a large cohort of patients with prostate cancer and conﬁrmed HO-1 nuclear localization in moderately advanced
tumors where it is enzymatically inactive and therefore may
be a critical regulator of cancer progression. We tested the
hypothesis that HO-1, through its ability to generate CO,
modulates cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo using human
and murine prostate and lung cancer models. Paradoxically,
CO rapidly enhanced mitochondria activity of cancer cells that
results in metabolic exhaustion and cellular collapse causing
tumor regression. Furthermore, CO increased cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutics 1,000-fold while simultaneously
protecting normal cell growth and viability.

Materials and Methods
Prostate cancer samples and tissue microarray
Benign and malignant samples of 482 patients undergoing
radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer were
subjected in duplicate to tissue microarray (TMA) constructs
of 1.0 mm in diameter and scored for immunohistochemical
staining intensity as previously described (24). The majority of
samples were successfully prepared (95%), and Gleason
grades were evaluated by a National Board–certiﬁed pathologist (L. Helczynski) in the prostate cancer specimens from
351 before preparation of TMA. The group of samples consisted of 246 samples with Gleason grade 3 and 105 samples
with Gleason grades 4 and 5. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee, Lund University and the Helsinki Declaration of Human Rights was strictly observed.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining of parafﬁn-embedded sections from human TMA blocks was conducted as previously
described (25). Mouse antibody against HO-1 (Stressgen, #OSA110) was used at 1:200 dilution. Secondary antibody was used
as a negative control. Immunohistochemistry, immunoﬂuorescence, and immunostaining on the cell lines and mouse
tumor samples were conducted as previously described (26).
Brieﬂy, formalin-ﬁxed or Zn-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tumor
tissues were processed for antigen retrieval with high-pressure
cooking in citrate buffer for 1 hour. Tissues sections were then
blocked with 7% horse serum for 30 minutes, followed by
incubation with primary antibody overnight. Biotin-labeled
secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) was applied for 1
hour at room temperature followed by Vectastain Elite ABC Kit
and detection with ImmPact DAB (Vector Laboratories).
Immunoﬂuorescence staining was conducted on frozen tumor
sections or cultured cells on glass coverslips. Tissues or cells
were ﬁxed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes followed
by permeabilization with 0.05% Triton X-100. After blocking
with 7% horse serum, sections were probed with primary

antibody and secondary ﬂuorescently labeled antibody (Molecular Probes). Hoechst-33258 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen)
was used to stain the nuclei.
The following antibodies were applied: polyclonal rabbit
anti-HO-1 (Stressgen) was used at 1:1,000. Prohibitin antibody
was purchased from Epitomics Inc. Cytochrome c antibody
was obtained from Cell Signaling. mtTFA and vimentin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antimouse Ki-67 antibody was from Dako. Anti-mouse Thy-1, CD31
antibody was from BD Biosciences, Pharmingen and anti-P
(Ser10)-histone H3 was from Cell Signaling. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) staining was conducted using ApopTag Peroxidase
In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon, Millipore) following manufacturer's protocol.
Animal tumor models
The tumor models were approved by the BIDMC IACUC.
Nu/nu mice were purchased from Taconic at 7 weeks of age.
Mice were provided food and water ad libitum as needed. After
1-week acclimatization, 1  106 PC3 cells were injected into the
right ﬂank of mice. Tumors were established for 2 weeks, at
which point treatment with CO  doxorubicin was begun. Mice
were exposed to CO (250 ppm, 1 h/d) as previously described
(27). Doxorubicin (8 mg/kg) was given i.v. twice per week just
before CO/air exposure. Tumor volume (0.52  width  length)
was measured and calculated every day for 14 days. After 14
days, mice were sacriﬁced and tumors were harvested. In the
orthotopic model of PC3 xenografts, 1  106 PC3 cells were
injected to the right lobe of prostate under anesthesia. Tumors
(n ¼ 4 per group) were established for 2 weeks followed by
CO/air treatment for 4 weeks. CO was administrated every day
for 1 hour at 250 ppm. TRAMP mice (Jackson Laboratories)
were treated with CO (250 ppm/d, 5 d/wk) starting at 5 weeks
of age. Treatment was continued for 20 weeks. Tumors were
harvested and processed for immunohistochemical analysis
thereafter. Kras4bG12D transgenic mice were kindly provided
by Dr. Varmus and were on doxycycline chow at 5 weeks of
age and CO was started after 8 weeks of doxycycline treatment.
CO (250 ppm, 5 d/wk) was continued for 5 weeks and the
lungs were harvested for histology.
Cell culture and treatment
The human prostatic cell line, PC3, human breast cancer
cells (MDA-468 and T47D), hepatocarcinoma (HepG2), cervical
cancer cells (HeLa), skin ﬁbroblasts (NIH3T3), and lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection or provided by Dr. Balk and Dr. Chen
(BIDMC) and were cultured in RPMI or Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and
antibiotics. Human bronchial epithelial cells were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured
following manufacturer's protocol. PNT1A were kindly gifted
by Dr. Nishtman Dizeyi (Lund University, Malmo, Sweden) and
were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and antibiotics. A549 rho(o) cells that are deprived of mitochondria were generated after 3 weeks of culture in medium
containing ethidium bromide (20 mg/mL). Mouse embryonic

ﬁbroblasts from p53þ/þ and p53/ mice were kindly gifted
by Dr. Tyler Jacks (MIT, Boston, MA) and were cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cells were treated
with camptothecin (0.001–10 mg/mL, Sigma) or doxorubicin
(10 mg/mL, Sigma) and vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide) for
1 to 24 hours. Cotreatment with CO (250 ppm) was conducted
as previously described (27). Pegylated catalase (3000 U/mL)
and SOD (10 U/mL) were from Sigma and were used 1 hour
before CO treatment.
Transient transfection
PC3 cells were transfected using Amaxa nucleofection or
Lipofectamine 2000 as previously described (24). pCMV control vector or human HO-1 cDNA encoding vector were used
for transfection. Transfection efﬁciency was between 40% and
50% as estimated with overexpression of GFP by ﬂuorescence
microscopy.
Comet assay
PC3 cells were treated with CO or air for 24 hours and
harvested for COMET SCGE Assay (Assay Designs). The manufacturer's protocol was followed. Cells were viewed by Zeiss
Axiovert Apotome Fluorescent microscope at 40. At least
100 cells were counted, and the amount of comets was calculated and expressed per 100 cells.
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed by brief sonication in ice-cold lysis buffer
[150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 10
mmol/L NaF, 1% SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF)] and the protease inhibitor cocktail Complete Mini (Roche). Samples were centrifuged
for 20 minutes at 14,000  g at 4 C and clear supernatants were
collected. Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Twenty to 30 micrograms of each
protein sample was electrophoresed on a NuPAGE 4%–12%
Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen) in NuPAGE MES SDS Running Buffer
(Invitrogen) followed by transfer to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) membrane (Ready Gel Blotting Sandwiches; BioRad).
The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, probed
with appropriate primary antibodies at concentration of
1:1,000 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5,000, and visualized using
Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) or
Femto Maximum Sensitivity substrate (Pierce), followed by
exposure to the autoradiography ﬁlm (ISC BioExpress). The
following antibodies were applied: rabbit anti-caspase-3, rabbit
anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technologies); goat antiGadd45 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-heme oxygenase-1 (RDI-Fitzgerald Industries Int); mouse anti-b-actin
(Sigma-Aldrich); mouse anti-GAPDH (Calbiochem); and rabbit
anti-cyclin A2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
HO-1 activity and CO levels in the tissues
PC3 cells were treated with 10 mg/mL doxorubicin or camptothecin for 4 hours, and nuclear/cytoplasmic fractions were
isolated. HO-1 activity was measured as previously described
(28). We assume that only HO-1 was contributing to the changes

www.aacrjournals.org

in HO activity assay as HO-2 remained unchanged in response to
doxorubicin and camptothecin treatment for 4 hours (data not
shown). Measurements of CO concentrations were conducted
on tissue sections as described by Verma and colleagues (29).
Tumor and normal tissues were harvested immediately after
the last exposure of mice to CO and tissues were processed for
gas chromatography as described. Brieﬂy, CO was liberated as
a gas in a sealed glass vial by adding 25 mL of water and 5 mL
of sulfosalicylic acid [SSA; 30% (wt/vol)] to 30 mL of diluted
tissue homogenate. The vials were incubated on ice for 10
minutes before being analyzed. The gas in the headspace of
the vials was then analyzed quantitatively with a gas chromatograph equipped with a reducing-compound photometry detector (Peak Laboratories), which allowed the CO in gas to be
quantiﬁed to concentrations as low as 1 to 2 parts per billion.
The amount of CO was then calculated using a calibration curve
prepared from CO standards.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from PC3 cells after treatment with 10
mg/mL camptothecin with or without CO for 6 or 24 hours using
RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Inc). Two micrograms of RNA was used for
cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). The region of Gadd45a was ampliﬁed with speciﬁc primers: F-50 TGCTCAGCAAAGCCCTGAGT30 ;
R-50 GCAGGCACAACACCACGTTA30 . The following primers to
b-actin were used: F- 50 CGCGAGAGAAGATGACCCAGATC30 ; R50 TCACCGGAGTCCATCACGA30 . Real-time PCR reactions were
conducted using 1SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (BioRad).
Primers for MMP2, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and
VEGF were previously described (24).
Apoptosis, viability, and clonogenic assays
PC3 cells were seeded at 1  105 concentration in 6-well
plates 24 hours before experiment. Cells were treated with
camptothecin (0.001–10 mg/mL) or doxorubicin (10 mg/mL)
with CO/air for 24 hours. Cells were harvested and apoptosis
rate was measured using Annexin V-FITC staining according
to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). To test cell
viability, PC3 cells were stained with crystal violet solution
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes, followed by extensive wash
with double distilled water. Cells were dried and dissolved in
10% acetic acid, followed by measurement of absorbance at 560
nm on the ELISA reader.
Clonogenic assay. Cells were treated in the presence or
absence of CO  chemotherapeutics as above for 24 hours.
After 24 hours, cells were trypsinized and seeded as a subculture with dilution of 1:10 to 1:100. Colony counts were conducted 2 weeks after seeding.
Cell fractionation
Nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction of PC3 cells were conducted using the Subcellular Fractionation Kit following the
manufacturer's protocol (Pierce) or BioVision Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Kit extraction (BioVision). Brieﬂy, cells were treated as
described above, washed twice with PBS, and trypsinized.
Pellets were collected and resuspended in ice-cold cytoplasmic
extraction reagent (CERI) buffer and vortexed. Lysates were
incubated on ice for 10 minutes, and CERII buffer was added

and lysates were incubated for additional 1 minute on ice. After
vortexing, lysates were centrifuge at 16,000  g and supernatants were collected for the cytoplasmic fraction. Pellets
were resuspended in ice-cold nuclear extraction reagent (NER)
buffer and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting as
described above.
Mitochondrial activity and metabolic proﬁling
SPECT. We used technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-sestamibi) single-photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) in PC3 cells treated with CO (250 ppm)
or CORM-A1 (20 or 100 mmol/L) for 24 hours in vitro. Technetium labeling was conducted at BIDM Imaging Facility, and
the radiation intensity was evaluated that corresponded to the
mitochondrial activity.

therapy. We evaluated 482 tumor specimens from patients
with prostate cancer with corresponding benign tissues by
tissue microarray to assess the correlation between nuclear
HO-1 expression and clinical tumor characteristics. The majority of benign samples showed low overall expression of HO-1
(Fig. 1A–B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In contrast, Gleason
grade 3 specimens showed signiﬁcantly higher expression of
HO-1 in the nucleus than that of corresponding benign tissue
(Fig. 1C and D;  , P ¼ 0.047). The intensity of nuclear HO-1
staining declined in Gleason grade 4–5 specimens as compared
with Gleason grade 3 but did not achieve statistical signiﬁcance

Seahorse experiments
Cells were seeded in 24-well plate (3  104) 24 hours before
experiment and treated with CO (250 ppm) or air for 30
minutes or CO was bubbled into the medium and transferred
to the reader immediately prior measurment. OCR and extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR) were measured over time.
LDH and glucose measurements
PC3 cells were treated for 6 hours with CO (250 ppm) and
harvested in the manufacturer's lysis buffers to measure glucose or lactate (Biovision, Glucose or Lactate Kits) and process
for colorimetric analysis of metabolites.
MitoTracker Red
CMCRos was purchased from Invitrogen, Molecular Probes
and was used at 0.2 mmol/L concentration. Cells were treated
for 3.5 hours with doxorubicin (10 ng/mL)  CO and MitoTracker Red CMCRos was added for the last 30 minutes of
treatment. Cells were washed and ﬁxed with 2% paraformaldehyde followed by staining with Hoechst.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 13.0
(SPSS Inc.). The differences in the expression of different markers between benign and cancer specimens were evaluated by
paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal–Wallis test. Distributions of overall survival and disease-free survival were estimated
by the method of Kaplan–Meier, with 95% conﬁdence intervals.
Differences between survival curves were calculated using the
log-rank test. Data are presented as the mean  SD and are
representative for at least 3 independent experiments. Student t,
ANOVA, and Wilcoxon tests were used for estimation of statistical signiﬁcance for the experiments (P < 0.05).

Results
Nuclear HO-1 with low activity in prostate cancer
correlates with poorer prognosis
HO-1 has been shown to be expressed and function in the
nucleus as a regulator of oxidative stress response transcription factor at the expense, however, of losing enzymatic activity
(30). On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that nuclear
translocation of HO-1 inﬂuences the response of cancer cells to

(Fig. 1A–H). Finally, there was no signiﬁcant difference in
cytoplasmic staining of HO-1 in prostate cancer versus adjacent benign samples (data not shown). We reasoned that high
nuclear HO-1 expression in moderately differentiated tumors
may correspond to the level of oxidative stress or hypoxia that
drives progression of differentiated tumors to more advanced
disease.
We next evaluated the clinical signiﬁcance of nuclear HO-1
expression by correlating HO-1 staining with biochemical
recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer as measured by prostate-speciﬁc antigen in the circulation (31) as well as overall
patient survival (Fig. 1H). High nuclear HO-1 (arbitrary intensity ¼ 3) expression in the cancer biopsies in comparison to low
(arbitrary intensity ¼ 1) nuclear HO-1 predicts a shorter time
to BCR (Fig. 1F;  , P ¼ 0.007). After a 20- to 30-month follow-up
period, a 20% greater number of patients with high nuclear HO1 relapsed in comparison to patients with low nuclear HO-1
(P ¼ 0.046), indicating a shorter time to recurrent disease in
patients with prostate cancer with a lack of enzymatically
active nuclear HO-1.
HO-1 activity and CO inﬂuence the cancer cell response
to genotoxins
Nuclear localized HO-1 is a hallmark of cancer progression
in prostate cancer (18). Comparing the HO-1 localization
proﬁles and activity of noncancerous cells (epithelial cells and
ﬁbroblasts) to cancerous cells (PC3, A549, HepG2, T47D, MDA468, HeLa), we found that cancer cell lines showed high nuclear
expression and low cytoplasmic expression, whereas noncancerous cells showed high cytosolic expression and low nuclear
expression (Fig. 2A and B). We show that when HO-1 is
localized to the nucleus it loses its activity in response to
common chemotherapeutics (Fig. 2C; ref. 30). On the basis of
nuclear localization of HO-1 with low activity (30), we next
asked whether HO-1 is important in mediating the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic treatment in vitro. DNA damage
causes mutations and carcinogenesis as well as induces cancer
cell death. HO-1 expression in normal cells is required for
appropriate DNA repair in response to chemotherapy or
irradiation (32). Using camptothecin and doxorubicin to
induce DNA damage, we tested the role of HO-1 and CO on
cancer and normal cell death. We observed signiﬁcant cell
death with camptothecin or doxorubicin in vector control–
treated PC3 cells as expected. Overexpression of HO-1 induced
further death of PC3 cells in response to camptothecin or
doxorubicin (Fig. 2D). A similar effect was observed in cells
after exposure to a low concentration of CO (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C; ref. 33). Dose escalation
experiments to induce cell death with camptothecin showed
that in the presence of CO, the sensitivity of cells to camptothecin increased synergistically to approximately 1,000-fold
over chemotherapy alone–treated cells (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). The effect was speciﬁc to DNA
damage–inducing agents as apoptotic responses induced by
TNF and cycloheximide were not altered after CO treatment
(data not shown). Further evidence of the effects of CO on PC3
cells in the presence of camptothecin showed that compared
with air controls, CO induced signiﬁcantly stronger cleavage of

www.aacrjournals.org

caspase-3, augmented DNA damage as measured by comet
assay, and induced Gadd45a expression, an important regulator of apoptosis and DNA repair that is induced in response
to chemotherapy (Supplementary Figs. S1D–S1F and S2).
Many reports detail the protective effects afforded by CO
and HO-1 in response to oxidative stress in primary cells (34–
36), which is in contrast to the above effects in prostate cancer
cells. Treatment of normal prostate epithelial cells (PNT1A)
with doxorubicin showed that unlike prostate cancer cells, CO
prevented doxorubicin-induced death of normal prostate cells
(Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S1G) supporting the remarkable selectivity of HO-1 and CO to enhance killing of tumor cells
while protecting primary cells. We conﬁrmed these ﬁndings
using primary mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) treated
with camptothecin or doxorubicin at the highest doses used
in cancer cells and evaluated the effects of CO. As expected, we
observed 75% to 90% cell death in response to both chemotherapeutics in air-treated cells. Similar to PNT1A, CO protected
primary MEFs against doxorubicin-induced cell death versus
air-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1H). The protection of
primary cells afforded by CO is independent of p53, a wellcharacterized modulator of cell death in response to DNA
damage. CO was also able to protect p53/ MEF (Supplementary Fig. S1H).
CO inhibits growth of human prostate cancer xenografts
We next evaluated the role of CO alone and CO in combination with doxorubicin on the growth of tumors in vivo,
using PC3 human prostate cancer xenografts implanted
subcutaneously in nude mice. Mice with established tumors
were exposed to a regimen of CO (250 ppm for 1 hour once a
day at the same time of day)  doxorubicin (doxorubicin was
injected immediately after CO treatment) and growth was
monitored over 2 weeks, at which point volumes of tumors
were measured and harvested for histologic analyses. Mice
treated with CO or doxorubicin alone showed signiﬁcant
tumor growth arrest versus controls as measured by tumor
volume and Ki-67 expression and had no effect on body
weight (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Combination treatment with doxorubicin plus CO showed further
additive effects with regard to tumor size, proliferative index,
and neovascularization (Fig. 3B–F). We did, however, observe
a signiﬁcant effect of CO alone or in combination with
doxorubicin on cell death that was not observed with doxorubicin alone, suggesting a distinct cellular target for CO (Fig.
3G and H). Mitotic catastrophe as assessed by occurrence of
aberrant nuclei after cell division was present among the pHistone H3–positive cells in tumors treated with CO or
doxorubicin (insets in Fig. 3E). Validation of the effects of
CO with immunostaining showed that CO inhibited the cellcycle marker cyclin A2 (densitometric analyses: air þ doxorubicin: 1.15  0.28, CO þ doxorubicin: 0.68  0.09; P < 0.05;
Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). The number of Thy-positive
ﬁbroblasts was markedly decreased in animals receiving CO
versus air treatment. It was not determined whether this was
due to less inﬁltration or increased cell death (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). Depletion of Thy-1–positive stromal cells may

contribution of endothelial cell proliferation and recruitment

CO induces apoptosis and blocks mitosis and
angiogenesis in a model of orthotopic prostate
cancer in mice
In a more clinically relevant model of orthotopic PC3
prostate cancer tumors, CO suppressed the mitotic index as
measured by p-Histone H3 and CD31 staining in established
tumors (8% and 6%, respectively; Fig. 4A–C). Importantly, CO
signiﬁcantly suppressed a key marker of invasion and early
metastasis known as uPA (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, CO showed

7014

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

the trend toward decreased expression of the tumor markers
MMP2 and VEGF; however, it did not reach signiﬁcance (Fig.
4D). Similar to the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model, CO
induced greater cell death in orthotopic tumors as compared
with tumors from air-treated mice (Fig. 4E and F; 35% in CO
versus 15% in air), suggesting that in addition to arresting
growth, CO reduced the invasive and aggressive phenotype
with a signature of mitochondrial collapse and tissue necrosis.
This was different than that observed in vitro where CO alone
did not affect cancer cell death yet inhibited cell cycle. In both
tumor models, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in the
amount of CO present within the tumor tissue as well as in
the liver and lung of CO-exposed mice (Fig. 4G and data not
shown).

CO prevents development of PIN/carcinoma lesions in
TRAMP mice and inhibits lung carcinoma growth in
Kras4bG12D transgenic mice
CO was tested in 2 additional models of spontaneously
developed tumors using the prostate tumor TRAMP and
the lung tumor Kras mouse models (26, 37). We started CO
treatment in mice 8 to 20 weeks of age, which is after
tumors are established (26, 37). Untreated mice showed a
high proliferative index as measured by Ki-67 staining in
the tumors showing multiple PIN foci and adenocarcinoma
(Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, CO-treated mice had fewer PIN
foci and signiﬁcantly less Ki-67–positive cells and some of
the CO-treated TRAMP mice were completely lesion-free
(Fig. 5A and B). Importantly, during the progression of the
disease and in contrast to the normal prostate where HO-1
is localized to the cytoplasm, HO-1 was expressed in the
nucleus in the PIN lesions (Fig. 5C). Staining for the
mitochondrial stress response marker mtTFA showed a
signiﬁcant increase in the number of mitochondria in the
lesions of CO-treated TRAMP mice as compared with the
neoplastic lesions in air-treated TRAMP mice at the same
age (Fig. 5D).

www.aacrjournals.org

A similar effect on tumor growth was observed in the Kras
lung tumor model where we observed a signiﬁcant inhibition in
both the frequency (average, n ¼ 24 in air vs. n ¼ 15 in CO) as
well as the size of the tumor nodules in the lung in animals
treated with CO versus air (Fig. 5E). Proliferation of tumors was
also signiﬁcantly inhibited as evidenced by decreased Ki-67
staining (Fig. 5F). Longer treatment with CO resulted in further
inhibition of tumor growth and size of the nodules (data not
shown).
CO targets mitochondria to induce death of cancer cells
We next explored potential molecular mechanisms by
which CO exerted its effects using prostate cancer cells as
our model. Of note, HO-1 and CO have been shown to induce
growth arrest of human cancer cells (38) as well as murine
AC29 mesothelioma cells (55% less cells at day 2 and 80% at
day 5 vs. air controls), which support a more global effect
of CO in a different type of cancer cells. Given that CO is
known to target mitochondria, and the data presented
in Fig. 3, we next assessed the activity and number of
mitochondria in cancer cells in the presence and absence
of CO. CO increased OCR within minutes after exposure,

which was accompanied by ROS generation in PC3 cells
that correlated with decreased ECAR and lactate levels
(Fig. 6A–E). Use of the mitochondrial complex I poison
rotenone to compare CO with another mitochondrial targeting compound and whether it would have similar effects in
these cells as CO showed complete blockage of the OCR as
was expected with rotenone and this effect occurred in
both cancer and noncancer cells (Fig. 6B). We also tested
mitochondrial potential using the JC-1 dye. As previously
reported in other cell types (39), CO increased mitochondria
membrane potential in PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
CO did inhibit OCR in normal cells, again suggesting a
selective difference in the response of cancer cells and
normal PNT1A cells to CO (Fig. 6B). The activation of

7016

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

mitochondrial activity by CO is likely contributes to a less
cancerous phenotype. As the treatment time with CO was
extended, PC3 cells showed clear G1 arrest (Fig. 6F), which
corresponded to signiﬁcant inhibition of metabolic activity
of cancer cells as measured by SPECT (Fig. 6G). Furthermore, exposure to CO induced mitochondrial stress as
evidenced by increased mtTFA, cytochrome c–positive
staining, and an inhibition in the oxidized state of mitochondria (Fig. 6H–K). Metabolic screening showed that
exposure of PC3 cells to CO for 6 hours resulted in a decrease
in glucose metabolism and inﬂuenced synthetic pathways
involved in nucleotide and amino acid synthesis, all of which
corroborate the effects of CO on cancer cell growth (Table 1;
Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S6).

doxorubicin in these cells in contrast to normal cells (% of

changes in mitochondrial function described above and the
speciﬁcally the increase in ROS generation, we next depleted
ROS using a cocktail of pegylated catalase and superoxide
dismutase. Addition of the antioxidant cocktail before treatment with CO resulted in reversal of the effects of CO on
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, further supporting ROS and
the mitochondria as the cellular target for CO (Supplementary
Fig. S7).

Discussion
In the present study, we elucidate a role for CO in
modulation of prostate and lung tumor growth and survival.
CO not only mimics the effects of chemotherapy alone by
blocking proliferation but also ampliﬁes tumor cell death
when treated in combination with either doxorubicin or
camptothecin. Furthermore, we provide evidence that CO
reduces the tumor burden in xenograft and transgenic
mouse models of prostate and lung cancers and effectively
blocks progression of neoplasia and adenocarcinoma. We
deduce that CO effectively switches the metabolic state of
the cancer cell to fuel oxidative metabolism and decreases
in nucleotide and amino acid synthetic pathways. Collectively, this causes cell-cycle arrest and collapse under
intense mitochondrial-dependent oxidative stress. In vitro,
this elicits a 1,000-fold increase in sensitivity to genotoxins
fostered, in part, by a mitochondria-dependent increase in
ROS generation. In vivo, the role of CO and ROS on tumor

www.aacrjournals.org

growth is less clear and likely involves other cellular
mechanisms including hypoxia and perhaps a heightened
immune response. Importantly, CO protects normal cells
from DNA damage by cytotoxic agents, in part, by reducing
oxygen consumption and eliciting a hibernation-like state
that has been observed in other cell types such as T cells
and smooth muscle cells with the induction of DNA repair
complexes (40).
HO-1 is an accepted cytoprotective gene in most stressrelated pathologies acting to reestablish homeostasis (41, 42).
Others and we have shown that nuclear-localized HO-1 no
longer possesses enzymatic activity and as such becomes
highly associated with cancer and tumor growth (30, 43). We
show that CO can mimic the effects of enzymatically active HO1 and that exposure to CO or reinstating HO-1 activity results in
enhanced sensitization and acceleration of apoptosis of cancer
cells and tumors while protecting normal cells against chemotherapeutic toxicity. This is consistent with prior observations that HO-1–derived CO is important in DNA repair in
normal cells (32). We posit that the subsequent decrease in
endogenous CO generation when HO-1 is in the nucleus results
in accelerated DNA stress and damage and thus serves as a
hallmark of early carcinogenesis.
In our cohort of patients, nuclear HO-1 is increased in a
subset of patients with prostate cancer with a shorter time to
BCR. We did not observe a signiﬁcant association of HO-1
expression with Gleason grades due to the relatively low
number of cohort cases with the most advanced disease
(Gleason grade 5). We would anticipate however statistically
signiﬁcant correlations in a larger cohort of patients as
reported by Sacca and colleagues who showed a clear association between HO-1 and prostate cancer incidence. Inhibition
of HO-1 pharmacologically using zinc-protoporphyrin (Zn-PP)
induced apoptosis and suppressed growth of sarcomas in rats
(44), but Zn-PP treatment failed to potentiate the antitumor
effects of 5-ﬂuorouracil, cisplatin, and doxorubicin in 3 different tumor models (45). HO-1 overexpression or CO exposure
reduced TPA-induced invasion of breast cancer cells (13) as
well as lung adenocarcinoma cells (38). The effects of HO-1 on
tumor growth and progression are complex and likely depend
on cancer types, the cell-cycle status, the model system, as well
as the methods of pharmacologic or genetic manipulation of
HO-1 activity.
In our model of human tumor xenografts in vivo, we
observed strong inhibition of angiogenic markers, mitosis, and
accelerated apoptosis in tumors treated with CO. Furthermore,
CO sensitized cancer cells and solid tumors to apoptosis with
apparent mitotic catastrophe likely inﬂuenced by cellular
exhaustion as evidenced by our biochemical data (Fig. 6). The
effects of CO on mitochondria have been well described and we
speculate that the high metabolic requirements of cancer cells
lend itself to greater effects of CO on survival given that CO is
known to target mitochondrial respiratory complexes (33).
This is supported by the effects of CO on mitochondrial
membrane potential (46), biogenesis (36), and decreased prohibitin (data not shown), which regulate cancer cell survival
and growth. PC-3 xenografts are partially resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, which delays tumor growth through

mitotic blockade (47). This effect was ampliﬁed by the presence
of CO in vitro and in vivo. The increase in ROS by CO in cancer
cells, likely augments protein and mitochondrial DNA (48).
Indeed, inhibition of HO-1 activity in prostate cancer cells
correlated with a reduction in protein carbonylation and ROS
formation (49).
The ﬁnding that CO protects normal cells from genotoxin
toxicity offers an added beneﬁt and may permit chemosparing
therapy, thus decreasing negative side effects. We have not
tested the response to irradiation, however considering that
CO protects normal cells against cell death via ampliﬁcation of
DNA repair (32), we expect that CO may have similar sparing
effects on normal cells in response to irradiation while amplifying cancer cell death in response to irradiation. CO-elicited
protection of normal cells suggests that normal cells tolerate
alterations in metabolic demands more efﬁciently and are
more capable of repairing damaged DNA. The effect of CO to
enhance killing is not speciﬁc to prostate cancer cells, as we
observed accelerated cell death of breast, lung, and other
prostate cancer cell lines treated with doxorubicin and CO as
well as dysregulated smooth muscle cells that lead to vascular
stenosis in models of angioplasty, transplantation, and pulmonary hypertension. CO at these doses has no untoward
effects on the animals and in fact also protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (36).
In summary, we show that HO-1 expression in cancer
specimens is targeted to the nucleus in moderately differentiated tumor cells for reasons that remain to be elucidated. Collectively, CO inﬂuences cellular bioenergetics that we
ﬁnd differs between cancer cells and normal cells. CO
accelerates oxidative metabolism and ROS generation,
unlike in noncancer cells where CO inhibits respiration and
protects against cell death. Insufﬁcient respiration due to
dysfunctional mitochondria drives what is known as the
Warburg effect. Exposure to CO uses Warburg physiology as
an advantage, compelling the cancer cell to consume more
oxygen that in turn drives metabolic demand, leading to
growth inhibition, cellular exhaustion, and death. These data
provide the ﬁrst evidence showing the potential for safe, low
amounts of CO to be used as an adjuvant therapeutic option
for the treatment of cancer. One might envision a speciﬁc

inhalational therapy regimen being implemented such as
that used here to treat patients with cancer with inhaled CO
using a speciﬁc metered dosing delivery device or a CO
releasing molecule (CO-RM; ref. 50).
