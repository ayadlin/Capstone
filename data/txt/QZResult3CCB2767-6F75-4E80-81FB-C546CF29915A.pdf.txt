Abstract
Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase
(HDAC) complex, which plays an important role in progression of breast cancer. Although MTA1 is known as a
repressor of the transactivation function of estrogen receptor a (ERa), its involvement in the epigenetic control of
transcription of the ERa gene ESR1 has not been studied. Here, we show that silencing of MTA1 reduced the level
of expression of ERa in ERa-positive cells but increased it in ERa-negative cells. In both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231,
MTA1 was recruited to the region þ146 to þ461 bp downstream of the transcription start site of ESR1 (ERpro315).
Proteomics analysis of the MTA1 complex that was pulled down by an oligonucleotide encoding ERpro315
revealed that the transcription factor AP-2g (TFAP2C) and the IFN-g–inducible protein 16 (IFI16) were
components of the complex. Interestingly, in MCF7, TFAP2C activated the reporter encoding ERpro315 and
the level of ERa mRNA. By contrast, in MDA-MB-231, IFI16 repressed the promoter activity and silencing of MTA1
increased expression of ERa. Importantly, class II HDACs are involved in the MTA1-mediated differential
regulation of ERa. Finally, an MDA-MB-231-derived cell line that stably expressed shIFI16 or shMTA1 was more
susceptible to tamoxifen-induced growth inhibition in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Taken together, our
ﬁndings suggest that the MTA1–TFAP2C or the MTA1–IFI16 complex may contribute to the epigenetic regulation
of ESR1 expression in breast cancer and may determine the chemosensitivity of tumors to tamoxifen therapy in
patients with breast cancer. Cancer Res; 74(5); 1484–94. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Estrogen receptor a (ERa) is a hormone-activated nuclear
receptor that plays critical roles in breast cancer pathogenesis,
progression, and treatment (1, 2). Two thirds of breast cancers
overexpress ERa, and are in general sensitive to hormonal
therapy and have a better prognosis than tumors with low or
absent ERa expression (3). By contrast, ERa-negative tumors
are resistant to hormonal therapy, which is associated with
early recurrence, development of metastasis, and a high tumor
grade and proliferative index with a greater probability of death
(4, 5). Given the effectiveness and low number of complications
associated with hormonal therapy, the possibility of inducing
hormone responsiveness in ERa-negative cancer remains an
attractive treatment strategy.

Previous research has suggested multiple mechanisms at
multiple levels for the generation and progression of the ERanegative breast cancer phenotype. Although ampliﬁcation of
the ERa gene ESR1 has been suggested as a common mechanism of ERa overexpression in breast cancer, the mechanism
of ERa loss is not clearly understood (6). Loss of heterozygosity
or mutation in the ER gene locus was demonstrated to play a
minor role in loss of ERa expression, which would imply that
ERa expression and its repression are controlled at the epigenetic level (7, 8). Indeed, hypermethylation of the CpG
islands in the ESR1 promoter has been found in certain
ERa-negative breast cancer cell lines and tumors (9, 10). ERa
expression was reactivated in ERa-negative breast cancer cells
by treatment with trichostatin A (TSA) and 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-dc), well-characterized pharmacologic inhibitors
of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation, respectively
(11–13). Moreover, several trans-acting factors were found to
contribute to ERa loss in ERa-negative tumor cells through
epigenetic mechanisms. Macaluso and colleagues (14) demonstrated that an epigenetic repressor pRB2/p130-E2F4/5histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)–DNA methyltransferase 1
(DNMT1)–SUV39H1 complex occupied the ESR1 promoter
and regulated ESR1 transcription in ERa-negative MDA-MB231 cells. In addition, Twist basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor recruited the HDAC1 and DNMT3B repressor complex
to the ER promoter, resulting in repression of ERa expression
and generation of hormone resistance in breast cancer cells
(15). Identiﬁcation and characterization of such key elements

Epigenetic Control of ERa Expression by MTA1

in the epigenetic regulation of ERa may provide a novel
therapeutic target in the treatment of breast cancer.
Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) is a cancer progression-related gene product that is overexpressed in a variety of
human cancers including breast, liver, ovarian, and colorectal
cancer (16). In breast cancer, MTA1 was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a
candidate metastasis-associated gene that was expressed in
highly metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines (17).
MTA1 was mapped to a region showing signiﬁcantly lower loss
of heterozygosity in primary breast cancers with metastasis
compared with node-negative tumors (18). Furthermore, MTA1
overexpression was closely associated with higher tumor grade
and increased tumor angiogenesis (19). MTA1 exists in coactivator or corepressor complexes containing RNA polymerase II
or HDAC and functions as a transcriptional coregulator to
activate or repress the transcription of target genes (20). For
instance, MTA1 activates the transcription of breast cancer
ampliﬁed sequence 3 (BCAS3), which contributes to tamoxifenresistance of breast cancer in premenopausal patients (21). By
contrast, as a component of the nucleosome remodeling and
histone deacetylation complex, MTA1 interacts with HDAC1
and represses the transcription of breast cancer 1, early onset
(BRCA1), which is known as a tumor suppressor gene, in the
ERa-positive breast cancer cell line MCF7 (22). Interestingly,
silencing of MTA1 by shRNA restored ERa expression in the
ERa-negative cell line MDA-MB-231 (23).
Although evidence suggests a potential role for MTA1 in
epigenetic control of chromatin remodeling and its involvement in ERa expression in breast cancer, a link between MTA1induced epigenetic control and the transcriptional regulation
of ESR1, and its signiﬁcance in the progression of breast cancer,
have not been addressed. Here, we report that MTA1 functions
as a regulator of transcriptional expression of ESR1 that
differentially controls ERa levels in ERa-positive and ERanegative breast cancer cells, a process that is associated with
trans-acting factors including transcription factor AP-2g
(TFAP2C) and IFN-g–inducible protein 16 (IFI16). We also
investigated the functional interplay between MTA1, TFAP2C,
and IFI16 that determines the sensitivity of breast cancer to
hormonal therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture
Human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, ERa positive,
MCF7, ZR75-1, and T47D, and ERa negative, MDA-MB-231,
and BT-20 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). The ERa negative, MDA-MB-453 was
obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB). These cells
were authenticated by ATCC and KCLB, by short tandem repeat
proﬁling and monitoring cell morphology. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium containing 10%
FBS at 37 C in a 5% CO2/95% air incubator. Valproic acid (VPA),
TSA, and tamoxifen were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
MC1568 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Plasmids, siRNA duplexes, and transient transfection
FLAG-tagged TFAP2C and IFI16 were constructed by inserting a PCR-ampliﬁed full-length human TFAP2C or IFI16 into

www.aacrjournals.org

p3XFLAG-CMV10 (Sigma-Aldrich). The pCDNA3–FLAG–
HDAC1, pCDNA3–FLAG–HDAC4, pCDNA3–FLAG–HDAC5,
and pCDNA3–FLAG–HDAC6 plasmids were kindly provided
by Dr. T.-P. Yao of Duke University (Durham, NC). The
ERpro315-Luc was constructed by inserting a PCR-ampliﬁed
þ146 to þ461 bp region of the ERa promoter region into the
pGL2 promoter (Promega). Sequences of siRNA duplexes used
in this study are described in Supplementary Table S1. Transient transfection and reporter gene analysis were performed
as described previously (24). The signiﬁcance of any differences
was determined using Student t test and was expressed as a
probability value. Differences in means were considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.
Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and
immunoﬂuorescence
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were carried out
as described previously using speciﬁc antibodies against ERa,
MTA1, TFAP2C, and IFI16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
a-tubulin (Calbiochem; ref. 24). For immunocytochemistry,
MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cell lines were cultured on glass slides.
Cells were ﬁxed and stained with antibody targeting MTA1,
TFAP2C, or IFI16, and Alexa Fluor 555- or 568-conjugated
secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Images were acquired using
confocal microscopy.
Reverse transcription PCR and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay
Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out using speciﬁc
primers as described previously (24). The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described previously using speciﬁc antibodies against MTA1, p300, N-CoR,
TFAP2C, IFI16, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and AcH3K9 (Abcam). Bound target DNA fragments
were detected using PCR. The primers used to amplify DNA
fragments are described in Supplementary Table S1.
DNA pull-down assay and liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry
Biotinylated ERpro315 DNA fragments were prepared by PCR
using biotinylated speciﬁc primers. Preparation of nuclear
extract and DNA pull down were performed as described
previously (24). After protein–DNA complexes were obtained,
the complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western
blotting using anti-MTA1, anti-TFAP2C, and IFI16 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Pulled down proteins fractionated by SDS-PAGE
were subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis, and analyzed as described previously (24).
Establishment of stable cell lines expressing shMTA1 and
shIFI16
pLKO.1-shMTA1 and pLKO.1-shIFI16 were constructed by
annealing primers and cloning the product into the AgeI-EcoRI
site of the pLKO.1-TRC vector. The lenti-shRNA targeting
MTA1, IFI16, or GFP, lentiviral packaging plasmids (psPAX2),
and envelope plasmid (pMD2.G) were cotransfected into
HEK293T packaging cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 60-hour incubation, the lentivirus in the supernatant

was collected and centrifuged and used to infect MCF7 or MDAMB-231 cells with hexadimethrine bromide at a ﬁnal concentration of 8 mg/mL. After puromycin selection (1.5–2.0 mg/mL)
for 2 to 4 weeks, stable clones were obtained and subsequently
conﬁrmed by Western blotting.
Clonogenic survival assays
MDA-MB-231 shRNA stable cell lines, shGFP, shMTA1,
and shIFI16, were seeded at 1,000 cells/plate in triplicate
into 35-mm plates. After 48-hour incubation, cells were
treated with 10 mmol/L tamoxifen for 12 days. At the end
of treatment, colonies were ﬁxed with methanol and stained
with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich). Colonies that composed of greater than 50 cells was counted. Statistical
signiﬁcance was evaluated by 2-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni posttest.
Xenograft experiments
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with
guidelines of Seoul National University Animal Care and Use
Committee. Female 6-week-old athymic (nu/nu) BALB/c mice
were obtained from Orient Bio Inc. and housed in an airconditioned room at a temperature of 22 C to 24 C and a
humidity of 37% to 64%, with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. After 1
week of acclimatization, tumor inoculation was performed.
Each 5  106 cells of MDA-MB-231 shGFP, shMTA1, and
shIFI16 stable cell lines were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) and inoculated subcutaneously into the
ﬂanks of mice. When the tumor volume reached approximately
100 mm3, mice were randomly divided into 2 groups. The
experimental groups received a 21-day release tamoxifen pellet
(25 mg/pellet) or a placebo pellet (Innovative Research of
America) for 2 weeks. Tumor diameter was measured with
caliper 2 times a week and tumor volumes were estimated
using the following formula: tumor volume (cm3) ¼ (length 
width2)  0.5. Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated by 2-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttest.

Gene expression analysis based on public datasets
The public datasets were obtained from ArrayExpress
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) with accession numbers
E-TABM-157 (25) and E-TABM-158 (26), and from Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/) with accession series GSE7390 (27) and GSE21921 (28).
E-TABM-157, E-TABM-158, and GSE7390 datasets were
obtained using the Human Genome U133A Array (Affymetrix),
and the GSE21921 dataset using the DASL HumanRef-8 Whole
Genome v3.0 (Illumina). The processed data including normalization procedures are available at the above websites. The
data for individual probe IDs were averaged and analyzed as
log 2 expression of the gene using Microsoft Excel. Signiﬁcance
of differences was determined by a 2-tailed unpaired t test.

Results
Differential regulation of ERa expression by MTA1 in
ERa-positive and ERa-negative breast cancer cells
To address the role of MTA1 in transcriptional control of
ESR1, we ﬁrst examined the level of ERa expression in the ERapositive MCF7 cells under conditions in which MTA1 was
silenced or overexpressed. When MTA1 was suppressed by
transfection of siRNA, the protein and mRNA levels of ERa in
MCF7 cells were both decreased (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this,
the levels of ERa protein and mRNA in MCF7 cells were
enhanced after overexpression of MTA1 (Fig. 1B). By contrast,
the repression of MTA1 expression by siMTA1 restored the
levels of ERa protein and mRNA in ERa-negative MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in other breast
cancer cell lines, such as ERa-positive ZR75-1 and T47D, and
ERa-negative BT-20 and MDA-MB-453 (Fig. 1). These results
indicate that MTA1 differentially regulates transcription of
ERa in ERa-positive and ERa-negative breast cancer cells.
To gain insight into the MTA1-induced differential regulation
of ERa transcription, we searched the ESR1 promoter regions for
the region to which MTA1 was recruited. Transcription of ESR1

is directed by at least seven different promoters, the usage of
which varies among tissues and cell types (29). We selected four
possible promoter regions of ESR1 with which MTA1 may be
associated (Fig. 2A). According to the literature, these regions
are strongly regulated in breast cancer cells, and show distinctly
different transcriptional activity between ERa-positive and
ERa-negative breast cancer cells (14, 30, 31, 32). ChIP assays
were performed with four sets of primers, one speciﬁc for each
putative region (Fig. 2A). In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231,
MTA1 was recruited to regions III (þ146 to þ377) and IV (þ310
to þ461), but not to regions I (3849 to 3612) and II (þ1 to
þ127; Fig. 2B). Thus, we named these two closely associated
regions the ERpro315 (þ146 to þ461). Knockdown of MTA1 in
both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 decreased the binding of MTA1 to
ERpro315, conﬁrming the speciﬁc association of MTA1 with this
promoter region. When the binding of MTA1 was decreased, the
acetylation level of lysine 9 in histone 3 (AcH3K9) and coactivator p300 binding were decreased in MCF7, indicating that loss
of MTA1 binding to ERpro315 decreased transcriptional activity
of ESR1 in MCF7. By contrast, binding of AcH3K9 was increased
and binding of corepressor N-CoR was decreased in MDA-MB231, suggesting that loss of MTA1 binding to the ERpro315
increased the transcriptional activity of ESR1 in MDA-MB-231.
Consistently, DNA binding levels of other epigenetic markers,
the activation marker H3K4me3 and the repression marker
H3K27me3, were altered after silencing of MTA1 in MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Together these results
indicate that the ESR1 promoter þ146 to þ461 region is

important for the MTA1-induced differential regulation of ESR1
expression in ERa-positive and ERa-negative breast cancer cells
(Fig. 2B).
TFAP2C and IFI16 are associated with the MTA1mediated transcriptional regulation of ESR1
To characterize further the MTA1-mediated regulation of
ESR1 expression, the MTA1 complex that bound to ERpro315
was pulled down from nuclear extracts of MCF7 or MDAMB-231 and subjected to proteomics analysis. Among the
proteins identiﬁed, TFAP2C and IFI16 recorded notable hits
with high-probability scores in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231,
respectively. To conﬁrm the binding of TFAP2C and IFI16
to ERpro315, a DNA pull-down assay followed by Western
blotting was performed. Binding of TFAP2C was observed
only in MCF7 while binding of IFI16 was seen only in MDAMB-231 (Fig. 3A). Binding of TFAP2C and IFI16 to ERpro315
in vivo was veriﬁed by ChIP assays (Fig. 3B). Reporter gene
analysis using a reporter encoding ERpro315 showed that
exogenously introduced TFAP2C activated the reporter in
MCF7, whereas IFI16 repressed it in MDA-MB-231, indicating that the binding of TFAP2C and IFI16 functionally
modulates the ESR1 promoter (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, we
found that TFAP2C was highly expressed in MCF7, whereas
IFI16 was highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3D). MTA1
was physically associated with TFAP2C in MCF7 and with
IFI16 in MDA-MB-231, especially in the nucleus (Fig. 3E
and F).

Figure 3. Differential binding of TFAP2C and IFI16 on ERpro315 of the ERa promoter. A, DNA binding of TFAP2C and IFI16 on ERpro315 was examined by
DNA pull-down assays. Nuclear extract obtained from MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with the PCR ampliﬁed double-stranded biotin

by anti-TFAP2c or anti-IFI16 antibodies were ampliﬁed by PCR using primers for ERpro315. C, MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with

Western blotting. E, whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with normal immunoglobulin G (IgG), anti-MTA1, anti-TFAP2C, or anti-IFI16
antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were fractionated and probed by Western blotting (WB) using an anti-MTA1, anti-TFAP2C, or anti-IFI16
antibody. F, subcellular localization of TFAP2C and IFI16 was examined by immunocytochemistry and the images were overlaid. Nuclei were visualized by
staining with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

Next, we tested whether TFAP2C and IFI16 were associated
with the MTA1-mediated differential regulation of ESR1 in
ERa-positive and ERa-negative breast cancer cells. The expression level of ERa was decreased when TFAP2C was knocked
down by siRNA, whereas it was signiﬁcantly upregulated at
both protein and mRNA levels by overexpression of TFAP2C
(Fig. 4A and B; ref. 33). TFAP2C-mediated activation of the
ERpro315 reporter was further enhanced by addition of MTA1
(Fig. 4C), but the TFAP2C-induced ERa expression disappeared when MTA1 was knocked down in MCF7 (Fig. 4D). In
the case of MDA-MB-231, repression of IFI16 using siIFI16
restored ERa expression (Fig. 4E). IFI16-mediated repression
of the ERpro315 reporter was further suppressed by coexpression of MTA1 (Fig. 4F).
Class HDAC II family is associated with the differential
regulation of ESR1
Earlier observations that HDAC inhibitors such as TSA and
VPA differentially regulate transcription of ESR1 suggest that

1488

Cancer Res; 74(5) March 1, 2014

HDACs may be involved in MTA1-mediated ERa regulation
(12, 34, 35). Indeed, TSA treatment altered the levels of AcH3K9
bound to the ERpro315 region in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 in
opposite ways, indicating that ERpro315 is involved in the
differential regulation of ERa by TSA (Fig. 5A). Although TSA
inhibits both class I and class II HDACs with similar potency
(IC50 values ranging from 100 to 300 nmol/L), VPA inhibits
class I HDACs with IC50 values of 0.7 to 1 mmol/L and class II
HDACs with IC50 values greater than 1.5 mmol/L (36). Interestingly, the half-maximal effects of the VPA-induced alterations of ERa levels in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 were estimated
at approximately 6 to 7 mmol/L, which may suggest that the
class II HDACs are involved in ERa regulation (Fig. 5B). As
expected, knockdown of the class II HDACs such as HDACs 4 to
6 altered ERa levels more efﬁciently than knockdown of
HDAC1 in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 5C and D).
Consistent with this, we found that HDACs 4 to 6 bound to
ERpro315 in both breast cancer cell types (Fig. 5E). These
observations suggest that the class II HDACs are involved in

Loss of IFI16 provides susceptibility to tamoxifeninduced cell growth inhibition for ERa-negative breast
cancer cells
To examine whether the loss of MTA1 or IFI16 restored
the tamoxifen sensitivity of breast cancer cells, we established stable MDA-MB-231-derived cell lines expressing
shMTA1 or shIFI16 using the lentiviral delivery shRNA
system (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, the MDA-MB-231
stable cell lines lacking either MTA1 or IFI16 showed
restored ERa expression. Tamoxifen treatment of these
cells signiﬁcantly reduced cell growth, whereas this hormone dependency was not seen in the shGFP control cells
(Fig. 6C). Clonogenic viabilities of both shIFI16 and
shMTA1MDA-MB-231 stable cells were signiﬁcantly lower
compared with shGFP control cells. Further survival fractions in response to tamoxifen treatment were dramatically
reduced in shIFI16 and shMTA1MDA-MB-231 stable cells
(Fig. 6D). To examine the in vivo susceptibility of the MDAMB-231 stable cells to tamoxifen treatment, the shRNA

ences in tumor growth of shIFI16 and shMTA stable cells
after tamoxifen treatment, whereas no difference in shGFP
control cells, strongly supporting the role of MTA1 in the
regulation of ERa expression (Fig. 6E). Taken together, our
results indicate that the MTA1 complex including TFAP2C
and class II HDACs enhances ESR1 transcription in MCF7,
whereas the MTA1 complex including IFI16 and class II
HDACs represses ESR1 transcription in MDA-MB-231, both
by binding to the ERpro315 region of the ESR1 promoter
(Fig. 6F).
Finally, we compared the expression levels of MTA1,
TFAP2C, and IFI16 in ERa-positive and ERa-negative breast
carcinomas using the public datasets obtained from ArrayExpress and GEO sites. Expression of MTA1 showed no significant correlation with ERa mRNA expression level in four
datasets that contain gene chip proﬁles classiﬁed by ERa
status of breast carcinoma tissues (25–28). Although the
expression level of TFAP2C was not consistently correlated
with that of ERa in these four datasets, in all datasets the IFI16
mRNA levels were clearly higher in ERa-negative than in ERapositive breast carcinomas (Fig. 7). These results raise the
possibility that overexpression of IFI16 in ERa-negative breast
cancer cells mediates ERa negativity and hormone resistance
during breast carcinogenesis.

Discussion
Therapeutic strategies for ERa-positive breast cancers
include ovarian ablation or anti-estrogen drug treatment.
However, target-directed therapies for ERa-negative breast
cancers are lacking, even though they are more clinically
aggressive and their prognosis is poor. Thus, reactivation of
ESR1 in ERa-negative breast cancer has been targeted as a
potentially successful breast cancer therapy. Earlier studies
showed that treatment with TSA and 5-aza-dc, two wellcharacterized pharmacologic inhibitors of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation, reactivated ERa expression in ERanegative breast cancer cells (11, 13). Here we show that MTA1 is
a transcriptional regulator that is associated with the epigenetic control of ERa expression. The ESR1 promoter region in
which MTA1 was recruited, the ERpro315 (þ146 to þ461), was
previously reported to be epigenetically controlled: in ERanegative breast cancer cell lines this region was methylated and
recruited methyl CpG binding protein and DNMTs, resulting in

1490

repression of ESR1 transcription (31, 32). We found that TSA
treatment decreased the level of H3K9 acetylation in the
ERpro315 (þ146 to þ461) in MCF7 cells but increased it in
MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating that histone acetylation is also
involved in the epigenetic control of this promoter region (Fig.
5A). Class II HDACs such as HDACs 4 to 6 may have important
roles in the differential regulation of the promoter as they bind
to ERpro315 (Fig. 5E). Our observations, together with others,
may suggest that MTA1 is a key regulator that coordinates
histone acetylation and DNA methylation, which provide
differential regulation of ERa expression during progression
of breast cancer.
We identiﬁed two putative transcription factors, TFAP2C
and IFI16, which are involved in the MTA1-mediated transcriptional regulation of ESR1. IFI16 is a member of the HIN200 family of IFN-inducible genes that is associated with
cell-cycle regulation and differentiation (37). Although

in human breast cancer and E2-induced downregulation of
IFI16 in breast cancer cells have been reported, the function
of IFI16 in estrogen signaling has not been studied (38, 39).
Here we report a novel molecular mechanism of IFI16 action
in the epigenetic control of ERa expression in breast cancer.
Furthermore, knockdown of IFI16 in MDA-MB-231 cells
enhanced their sensitivity to tamoxifen-induced tumor cell
growth inhibition, indicating that the MTA1–IFI16 repressor
complex may contribute to loss of ERa expression and
acquisition of hormone resistance in ERa-negative breast
cancer. Interestingly, exogenously introduced IFI16 resulted
in decreases in the mRNA levels of androgen receptor and
inhibited cell proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line
LNCaP (40). As the role of androgen receptor in breast
cancer development and treatment has attracted attention,
understanding of the function of IFI16 in hormone resistance and transcriptional regulation of hormone receptors

www.aacrjournals.org

may contribute to development of a novel strategy to treat
breast cancer (41).
TFAP2C, the expression of which decreases during hormone
therapy, is considered an independent predictor of poor survival in patients with breast cancer (33). In an earlier study, it
was reported that TFAP2C could be puriﬁed from a protein
complex bound to a region of the ESR1 promoter including the
ERpro315 (þ146 to þ461) region (42). Subsequently, TFAP2C
was shown to upregulate ESR1 expression in breast cancer cells
by alteration of chromatin structure (32, 33). Here, we demonstrated that MTA1 binds to TFAP2C and is required for
TFAP2C-induced ESR1 activation (Figs. 3 and 4), which
explains the epigenetic mechanism of TFAP2C function. We
speculate that MTA1 may recruit class II HDACs to the
ERpro315 region occupied by TFAP2C. In this regard, MTA1
was shown previously to bind HDAC4 (43). Interestingly,
HDAC4 and HDAC5 interacted with p300 in MCF-7 but not

in MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Furthermore, the
binding between these HDACs and p300 was abolished when
expression of TFAP2C was silenced by siRNA (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). These data indicate that MTA1 complex including
TFAP2C and class II HDACs recruits p300 for transcriptional
activation of ERa in MCF7 cells. However, we compared target
genes of TFAP2C reported by Woodﬁeld and colleagues (44)
and that of MTA1 (varied by 2  fold, 0.05  P-value) proﬁled by
Ghanta and colleagues (45), and found that expression of 26
genes are altered by MTA1 and TFAP2C in common (Supplementary Table S2). Among these genes, Depdc6 and Svil were
identiﬁed as primary target genes of ERa, according to the
global mapping of ChIP-seq analysis for ERa-controlled gene
network in luminal-like breast cancer cells (46). These results
strongly support the link between TFAP2C and MTA1 in
regulation of luminal target genes of ERa in breast cancer cells.
Our results, together with previous reports, show that
epigenetic regulation is one of the most important molecular
mechanisms that results in the absence of ERa in hormoneresistant breast cancer cells. Indeed, in the clinic, reactivation
of ESR1 enhanced the chemosensitivity to tamoxifen in ERanegative breast carcinoma. For example, in a recent phase II
trial, combined therapy with tamoxifen and an HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat, for patients with ERa-positive breast cancer

1492

Cancer Res; 74(5) March 1, 2014

who had undergone prior hormonal therapy or chemotherapy
was well tolerated and reversed hormone resistance (47).
Currently, a clinical trial is underway of a combined treatment
with tamoxifen, decitabine (5-aza-dc), and LHB589, an HDAC
inhibitor, for triple-negative breast cancer patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT01194908). In this study, we found
that class II HDACs were more efﬁcient than class I HDACs in
the restoration of ERa in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that a
combination therapy including selective class II HDAC inhibitors may provide a better therapeutic index for sensitizing
breast cancers to systemic treatments involving tamoxifenbased chemotherapies.
