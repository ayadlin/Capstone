BACKGROUND: This study was performed to compare efficacy and toxicity profiles of paclitaxel using 3-hour versus
96-hour infusion schedules. METHODS: Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were randomly assigned to
receive paclitaxel starting at a dose of 250 mg/m2 intravenously (iv) over 3 hours every 21 days or paclitaxel starting at
a dose of 140 mg/m2 iv over 96 hours every 21 days. Stratification variables included number of prior chemotherapy
regimens and previous response to anthracyclines. Response was assessed every 2 cycles using bidimensional measurements. Patients were allowed to cross over at disease progression or therapy intolerance. RESULTS: A total of 214
patients received therapy (107 patients per arm). Response rates were similar: 23.4% in the 3-hour arm and 29.9% in the
96-hour arm (P ¼ .28). The median duration of response (8.9 months vs 5.7 months; P ¼ .75) and progression-free survival
(5.0 months vs 3.8 months; P ¼ .17) slightly favored the 96-hour arm. Overall survival was slightly longer in the 3-hour arm
(14.2 months vs 12.7 months; P ¼ .57). One patient who crossed over to the 96-hour arm (N ¼ 18) developed a partial
response; no response was noted with crossover to the 3-hour arm (N ¼ 10). Myalgia/arthralgia and neuropathy were
more frequent in the 3-hour arm, whereas mucositis, neutropenic fever/infection, and diarrhea were more common in the
96-hour arm. CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel given by 3-hour or 96-hour infusion was active in MBC. The 96-hour paclitaxel
regimen did not significantly improve response or time to disease progression, was more cumbersome to administer, and
was associated with greater myelosuppression (but less neuropathy and myalgia) compared with the 3-hour schedule.

Paclitaxel enhances microtubule polymerization, is cytotoxic to cells undergoing mitosis, and has been approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of breast cancer in the advanced and localized settings. Paclitaxel
has been administered using various doses and schedules for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Randomized trials established the optimum dose of paclitaxel to be 175 mg/m2 when administered on an every 3-week basis.1,2
The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project compared paclitaxel given at a dose of 250 mg/m2 using a 3hour versus a 24-hour infusion schedule to patients with stage IIIB to IV breast cancer.3 Response rates (RR) improved
(54% vs 44%) with the 24-hour infusion, but there was no significant difference noted with regard to progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). The 24-hour infusion was associated with greater myelosuppression and febrile neutropenia, whereas the 3-hour infusion was associated with higher rates of neuropathy.
Paclitaxel induces mitotic arrest at low concentrations in mammalian cells, and preclinical models have demonstrated that prolonged drug exposure results in greater cytotoxicity in cycling cells treated with paclitaxel.4,5 Thus, it has
been hypothesized that an even more prolonged administration of lower doses of paclitaxel could result in greater antitumor activity and reduced toxicity. The feasibility and efficacy of prolonged paclitaxel administration has been tested in

small nonrandomized phase 1 of 2 trials. Wilson et al
reported a phase 1/2 study of paclitaxel administered by
continuous infusion over 96 hours.6 Myelosuppression
and mucositis were the dose-limiting toxicities associated
with this regimen, and 140 mg/m2 was selected as the recommended phase 2 dose. Thirty-six patients with MBC
were treated at this dose, and 48% achieved a partial
response (PR).
Seidman et al also reported the results of a phase 2
trial of paclitaxel given at a dose of 120 to 140 mg/m2 by
continuous infusion over 96 hours in patients with disease
progression while receiving short infusions of paclitaxel or
docetaxel.7 Of the 26 patients evaluated, 27% achieved a
response to treatment. Myelosuppression and mucositis
were also noted, but no hypersensitivity, despite the absence of premedications.
Based on these data, we performed a randomized
trial to compare the toxicity and efficacy of paclitaxel
administered by 3-hour versus 96-hour infusion in
patients with taxane-naive MBC. To determine the ability
of either regimen to rescue tumors that had become refractory to initial paclitaxel treatment, consenting patients
were allowed to cross over to the alternative treatment
arm at the time of disease progression or treatment
intolerance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Eligible patients were aged >15 years with histologically
confirmed carcinoma of the breast and documented
MBC who had received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting (prior anthracycline or anthraquinone was required) and had a life
expectancy of >12 weeks; had Zubrod performance
status of <3 (Karnofsky performance status of >60%);
had adequate bone marrow, liver, kidney, and heart function; had measurable or evaluable disease; had a functioning central venous catheter (if randomly assigned to the
96-hour infusion schedule); and had provided written
informed consent. Exclusion criteria included prior taxanes, brain metastases controlled for <6 months, or other
primary invasive malignancies within the past 5 years,
except localized squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the
skin.
Study Design and Treatment
The current study was a multi-institution study conducted in accordance with the US Food and Drug

Cancer

February 15, 2010

Administration, the Institutional Review Boards at each
institution, and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients
provided informed consent before study participation.
Participating centers included The University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center, National Cancer Institute
Community Clinical Oncology Program, Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Duke Comprehensive
Cancer Center, and the British Columbia Cancer Center.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel
administered using a 3-hour infusion schedule or a 96hour infusion schedule. Patients were stratified by number
of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 vs 2) and history of
doxorubicin sensitivity. Doxorubicin sensitivity was
defined as recurrence occurring >6 months after completing an adjuvant regimen containing anthracycline or
achievement of a complete response (CR) or partial
response (PR) to doxorubicin or mitoxantrone that persisted for at least 6 months in the metastatic setting.
After randomization, dosing was based on risk for
developing myelosuppression. High-risk patients were
defined as those who had received prior mitomycin-C,
irradiation to bone marrow-bearing bones, or those who
had a history of myelosuppression that required dose
reduction, support with colony-stimulating factors, or
delays in prior chemotherapy administration. For the 96hour arm only, based on the experience of Wilson,6 highrisk patients were also defined as those with an elevation
of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase
to more than twice the upper limit of normal.
For the 3-hour infusion, patients received standard
hypersensitivity prophylaxis with dexamethasone at a dose
of 20 mg by mouth 12 hours and 6 hours before treatment
and cimetidine at a dose of 300 mg intravenously (iv) and
diphenhydramine hydrochloride at a dose of 50 mg iv 30
minutes before chemotherapy administration. The starting doses of paclitaxel were 250 mg/m2 in standard-risk
patients and 200 mg/m2 in high-risk patients. Chemotherapy was administered iv over 3 hours on Day 1 of a
21–day cycle.
For the 96-hour infusion, no premedication was
given. Starting doses for standard-risk and high-risk
patients were 140 mg/m2 and 125 mg/m2, respectively.
Chemotherapy was administered iv over 96 hours through
a central venous catheter on Days 1 to 4 of a 21–day cycle.
Because of limited stability at room temperature, infusion
pumps were loaded with enough paclitaxel to last 48
hours and patients returned for a second loading on Day 3
of treatment. Pumps were discontinued after administration of 96 hours of treatment.

Treatment was continued until disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent.
Increased dosing was allowed in patients with minimal
toxicity (Table 1). Crossover therapy was not permitted
until evidence of disease progression or documentation of
treatment intolerance. All patients who crossed over to the
alternative treatment arm were required to provided a second consent before the initiation of therapy.
Chemotherapy doses were held until therapyinduced toxicity was  grade 1 (except alopecia). Doses
were reduced or discontinued (as listed in Table 1) based
on the following toxicities: neutropenia or febrile neutropenia that persisted despite growth factor support, platelet
count <25,000, grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, or
delayed recovery of toxicity to grade 1 that persisted for
>28 days. All patients who received treatment were
assessed for toxicity using the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE). Toxicity assessments occurred at baseline and
before each cycle of therapy. Response was assessed every
2 cycles of therapy using bidimensional measurements.
After confirmation response, response assessment was
allowed after every 3 cycles of therapy. Nine patients (3 in
the 3-hour treatment arm and 6 in the 96-hour treatment
arm) discontinued protocol therapy before assessment of
response and were considered nonresponders for the purposes of statistical analyses.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objectives of this study were to compare RR
(CR and PR) and time to disease progression (TTP)
between the two infusion schedules. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 and stratified as described earlier.
Based on a 1-sided test with a type I error rate of 0.05,
113 patients per arm were required to obtain 90% power
to detect an improvement in response from 30% (3-hour
treatment arm) to 50% (96-hour treatment arm) and a

816

90% power, based on a 1-sided type I error rate of 0.05,
to detect an increase in median time to progression from 3
months (3-hour treatment arm) to 4.5 months (96-hour
treatment arm). Interim analyses were planned using the
O’Brian-Fleming method8 after 1/3 patients and 2/3 of
patients, respectively, had response evaluations.
Crossover therapy was permitted as described, and
outcomes in each crossover arm were evaluated separately.
One interim analysis was planned after 14 patients per
crossover arm were evaluated for response.
All analyses were on an intent-to-treat basis and
included all patients who received therapy. Patient characteristics and responses were compared using the Wilcoxon
rank sum test or the chi-square test, as appropriate. PFS
and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method9
and compared between arms using a stratified log-rank
test8,10 with stratification factors. A multivariable logistic
regression model was fit to assess association between treatment arms with CR/PR while accounting for patient characteristics (treatment arm, patient’s age, performance status,
number of prior chemotherapy regimens, doxorubicin sensitivity, and number of courses). Similarly, multivariable
Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models11 were fit
for both PFS and OS. Goodness-of-fit for each continuous
variable in each PH model was assessed with martingale residual plots and the Grambsch-Therneau test.12,13 P values
for assessing treatment effects on CR/PR and PFS are 1sided, as specified by the trial design, whereas all other P
values are 2-sided.

RESULTS
Patient Population
A total of 217 patients were randomly assigned to the
study. Three patients randomly assigned did not receive
therapy, 1 withdrew informed consent after being randomly
assigned to the 96-hour arm, and 2 patients were found to
be ineligible after randomization, both of whom were
assigned to the 3-hour arm. Thus, 214 patients received at
least 1 cycle of treatment. A total of 107 patients were randomly assigned to receive the 3-hour infusion and 107 to
receive the 96-hour infusion. The median patient age was
54 years (range, 33-81 years), and 72% had a Zubrod performance status of 1 or 2, despite the presence of visceral
organ involvement in most patients treated. Nineteen
(8.9%) patients had MBC as their initial diagnosis. The
median disease-free interval was 24.1 months (range, 0181.6 months). At enrollment, 53% of patients were considered to be doxorubicin sensitive and all patients had
received prior chemotherapy, with nearly half receiving 2

Thirty-six patients (33.6%) in the 3-hour treatment arm
required 1 or more dose reductions compared with 35
patients (32.7%) in the 96-hour treatment arm. Nineteen
patients (17.8%) underwent dose escalation in the 3-hour
arm, and 16 patients (15%) underwent dose escalation in
the 96-hour arm. The maximum administered dose was
330 mg/m2 in the 3-hour treatment arm (1 patient) and
150 mg/m2 in the 96-hour treatment arm (8 patients).

PS indicates performance status.

Of the 214 patients treated, 205 were evaluated for
response (104 in the 3-hour infusion arm and 101 in the
96-hour infusion arm) (Table 3). Reasons for nonevaluation included discontinuation due to toxicity (N ¼ 3; 1
patient in the 3-hour arm and 2 patients in the 96-hour
arm), refusal of therapy (1 patient in the 96-hour arm),
protocol violation for concurrent use of hormonal therapy
(1 patient in the 3-hour arm), inadequate disease assessment (2 patients; 1 in the 3-hour arm and 1 in the 96hour arm), and early death unrelated to disease progression (2 patients in the 96-hour arm).
Twenty-five patients (23.4%) treated in the 3-hour
arm achieved response (CR in 2.8% and PR in 20.6%),
compared with 32 (29.9%) patients in the 96-hour arm
(CR in 2.8% and PR in 27.1%; 1-sided P ¼ .140). After
adjustment for patient characteristics, patients randomized to the 96-hour arm had 1.47 times the odds of
achieving a CR or PR compared with patients randomized
to the 3-hour arm (P ¼ .26). There was no significant
interaction noted between treatment arm and any patient
characteristic on multivariate analysis (data not shown).
The median response duration was 5.7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.2-10.4 months) versus 8.9
months (95% CI, 5.8-11.8 months) on the 3-hour versus
96-hour treatment arms, respectively (P ¼ .75) (Table 3).
Of the 28 patients crossed over to the alternative
treatment arm, 18 (64%) received 96-hour infusion and
10 (36%) received 3-hour infusion. One patient who
crossed over to the 96-hour infusion achieved a PR (RR ¼
6%), but none of the patients who crossed over to the 3hour treatment arm achieved a response.

prior chemotherapy regimens. Approximately 28% of
patients had received only adjuvant therapy, approximately
40% had received only treatment for MBC, and approximately 30% had received chemotherapy in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Nearly half of the patients had
hormone receptor-positive disease (50% in the 3–hour
treatment arm and 42% in the 96-hour treatment arm),
and the majority were enrolled before testing for HER–2
became standard clinical practice. Patient characteristics
were balanced between the 2 treatment arms (Table 2).

Therapy Administration
Patients in the 3-hour arm received a median number of 5
cycles (range, 1-43 cycles) and those in the 96-hour arm
received a median number of 6 cycles (range, 1-30 cycles).

The median follow-up was 13.6 months (range, 0.497.9 months). At the time of last follow–up, all patients
had experienced disease progression or had died. The median PFS was 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.2-5.7 months) on
the 3-hour arm and 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.6-7.2

months) on the 96-hour arm (1-sided P ¼ .083) (Fig.
1A). The PFS was significantly different between the
treatment arms within the subgroup of patients considered to doxorubicin sensitive (median PFS of 4.7 months
in the 3-hour arm vs 6.7 months in the 96-hour arm; P ¼
.006); but was not significantly different within the subgroup of patients considered to doxorubicin resistant (P
¼ .49).
The median OS was 14.2 months (95% CI, 12.616.4 months) versus 12.7 months (95% CI, 10.3-15.5
months) on the 3-hour treatment arm versus the 96-hour
treatment arm, respectively (P ¼ .57) (Fig. 1B). In the
multivariable models for both PFS and OS, the number
of courses was found to violate to PH assumption for both
PFS and OS and therefore this was included as a stratification term rather than as a predictive variable in the model.
Martingale residual plots for age and disease-free interval
were linear for both PFS and OS, and therefore each of
these variables was included without transformation in
each PH model linear term. After adjustment for other
patient characteristics, compared with the 3-hour treatment arm, the 96-hour treatment arm was found to be
associated with a 21% reduction in the hazards of disease
progression or death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI,
0.58- 1.09 [P ¼ .16]) (Table 4). However, compared with
the 3-hour regimen, the 96-hour regimen was associated
with an 11% increase in the hazard of death (HR, 1.11;
95% CI, 0.80-1.53 [P ¼ .55]). There were no statistically
significant interactions noted between treatment arm and
any of the other variables for either PFS or OS. Of particular interest was the interaction between treatment arm
and doxorubicin sensitivity for PFS, although the interaction term did not attain statistical significance (P ¼ .233).

Table 5. Incidence of High-Grade Toxicitya by Treatment Arm

Toxicity

All patients treated (N ¼ 214) were evaluated for
treatment-related adverse events (Table 5). The 96-hour
administration schedule was associated with higher rates
of grade 4 neutropenia (64% vs 56%) and a higher incidence of neutropenic fever/infection with neutropenia
(32% vs 11%). Two patients treated with the 96-hour
schedule died from neutropenic infection, but no neutropenic deaths were noted using the 3-hour infusion schedule. Grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia was uncommon and
was found to be similar between the 2 treatment arms
(8% vs 11%).
The 96-hour arm had higher rates of stomatitis
(grade 3-4, 33% vs 6%; P < .0001) and low-grade diarrhea (grade 1-2, 44% vs 22%; P ¼ .0005); however, rates
of high-grade diarrhea were similar between the arms.
The 3-hour arm had higher rates of neuropathy (grade 23, 61% vs 13%; P < .0001) and myalgia-arthralgia (grade
2-3, 59% vs 30%; P < .0001). Nausea, vomiting, and
fatigue were common and similar between the 2 arms
(Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Preclinical data have suggested that low-dose paclitaxel
induces mitotic arrest and enhances cytotoxicity when
administered over prolonged periods of time by increasing
drug exposure to cycling cells.4,5 In addition, prolonged
paclitaxel administration was tested in small nonrandomized trials with promising results.6,7
However, the results of this larger randomized trial
do not support the hypothesis that prolonged exposure
(96-hour infusion) to low-dose paclitaxel either improves
efficacy or tolerability compared with higher doses given
using a 3-hour infusion schedule. Of the patients randomized to the 3-hour arm, 25 (23.4%) achieved a response

compared with 32 (29.9%) in the 96-hour arm (1-sided
P ¼ .140). The median duration of response (8.9 months
vs 5.7 months) and PFS (5.0 months vs 3.8 months) were
found to be slightly higher in the 96-hour arm, but neither of these trends was statistically significant. The OS
was not found to be significantly different between the 2

treatment arms, with a trend favoring the 3-hour arm
(14.2 months vs 12.7 months).
In addition, the crossover design of this study demonstrated little activity for 96-hour paclitaxel in patients
with disease that was refractory to 3-hour paclitaxel. Of
the 18 patients crossed over to 96-hour paclitaxel, only 1
patient responded (RR, 6%). This is substantially lower
than the 27% RR previously reported by Seidman et al.7
The differences between the 2 studies are likely attributable to the small numbers of patients involved and
between-study effects, including subtle differences in the
patient populations. For example, 29% of the patients
treated in the study by Seidman et al had disease progression while receiving docetaxel and all of these patients
achieved response to 96-hour paclitaxel.7 Moreover,
although the median time since prior taxane was 1 month,
some patients were enrolled up to 7 months from prior
taxane therapy. Our patients were taxane–naive at the
point of study entry and therefore had only received 3hour paclitaxel before crossover. They were also immediately enrolled on the 96-hour arm at the time of disease
progression.
The incidence of grade 3 to 4 toxicity was similar
between the 2 arms, but the toxicity profiles differed. The
96-hour infusion was associated with higher rates of neutropenia, neutropenic fever/infection, stomatitis, and
low-grade diarrhea, whereas the 3-hour infusion was associated with higher rates of neuropathy and myalgia. These
results mirror prior experiences with 24-hour or 96-hour
infusion schedules.3,6,7 Although slightly lower rates of
grade 3 to 4 neutropenia were observed in the patients in
the current study who received 96-hour paclitaxel compared with that historically observed with 24-hour infusion (64% vs 81%), the incidence of neutropenic fever/
infection were similar.3 In addition, the administration of
96-hour paclitaxel was quite cumbersome in that it
required central venous access, ambulatory infusion
pumps, and multiple visits to load and then discontinue
the infusion pump.
The results of the current study also should be considered in the context of recent advances in paclitaxelbased therapy, specifically the use of weekly administration of lower dose paclitaxel. Several phase 2 trials have
demonstrated considerable efficacy with a tolerable toxicity profile predominately comprised of neuropathy with a
low incidence of grade 3 to 4 myelosuppression.14-18
These results have been confirmed in randomized trials
that demonstrated a significant improvement in RR (42%
vs 27-29%) and, in the case of the Cancer and Leukemia

820

Group B (CALGB) trial, significant improvement in
TTP (9 months vs 5 months) and OS (24 months vs 12
months) for weekly paclitaxel compared with every 3week regimens.19,20 Taken together, these data do not
support the use of prolonged infusion paclitaxel as the
optimal regimen for the routine treatment of patients
with advanced breast cancer. Because of a decreased incidence in neuropathy and myalgia, the 96-hour infusion
schedule (administered with growth factor support) may
be a consideration for patients at high risk for peripheral
neuropathy.
