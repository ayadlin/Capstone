ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy of plasma cells in the
bone marrow. Despite multiple treatment options, MM is inevitably associated with
drug resistance and poor outcomes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi’s) are
promising novel chemotherapeutics undergoing evaluation in clinical trials for the
potential treatment of patients with MM. Although in preclinical studies HDACi’s have
proven anti-myeloma activity, but in the clinic single-agent HDACi treatments have
been limited due to low tolerability. Improved clinical outcomes were reported only
when HDACi’s were combined with other drugs. Here, we show that a novel panHDACi AR-42 downregulates CD44, a glycoprotein that has been associated with
lenalidomide and dexamethasone resistance in myeloma both in vitro and in vivo. We
also show that this CD44 downregulation is in part mediated by miR-9–5p, targeting
insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), which directly binds
to CD44 mRNA and increases its stability. Importantly, we also demonstrate that AR42 enhances anti-myeloma activity of lenalidomide in primary MM cells isolated from
lenalidomide resistant patients and in in vivo MM mouse model. Thus, our findings
shed light on potential novel combinatorial therapeutic approaches modulating CD44
expression, which may help overcome lenalidomide resistance in myeloma patients.

show 5 year survival in more than 70% of the cases, which
is reduced to ~50% in the transplant ineligible subjects
[4, 5]. However, the overall survival of patients carrying highrisk MM cytogenetic abnormalities is still very poor and they
inevitably relapse [3]. Alternative novel treatment strategies
are therefore urgently needed [6–9]. Epigenetic modifications
such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, as well
as microRNA deregulation play important roles in the
pathogenesis and treatment responses of MM [10–13].
Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases
(HDACs) affect a broad-array of genes involved in cell cycle,
apoptosis, and protein folding [14]. The first FDA-approved
deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), suberoylanilide hydroxamic
acid (SAHA, Vorinostat), was shown to be effective in vitro
and to have clinical efficacy in T-cell lymphomas [15].
However, in MM it showed only minimal activity as a single
agent [16]. For most HDACi’s the mechanism of action in MM
is unknown, but at biologically achievable concentrations, it
has been theorized that HDACi’s can sensitize MM cells to
other drugs by interfering with cell adhesion mediated drug
resistance (CAM-DR) [17–19]. Indeed, in two phase 1 trials
some patients were able to be salvaged by a combination of
HDACi’s (SAHA, or panobinostat) with proteasome inhibitor,
bortezomib [20, 21]. Also phase 1/2 studies of combination of
SAHA, or panobinostat with lenalidomide have demonstrated
tolerability and activity in lenalidomide-refractory patients
[22, 23]. Recently, a novel orally bioavailable class I/II,
phenylbutyrate-based HDAC inhibitor, AR-42 (ARNO
Therapeutics, Parsippany, NJ) has been developed and shown
to have a greater anti-proliferative effects, as compared to
SAHA, both in vitro and in vivo [24]. One of the biological
effects of AR-42 is that it is able to inhibit activation of STAT3
even in the presence of interleukin (IL)-6 activation signal and
thus, induce apoptosis of MM cells [25].
Dexamethasone and lenalidomide resistance in MM has
been attributed to upregulation of CD44 [26], which is a cell
surface glycoprotein playing roles in cell adhesion, migration
and cell-cell interactions [27]. It functions as a receptor for
hyaluronic acid, which itself is considered a tumor marker
in cancer [28, 29]. Moreover, CD44 forms a complex with
STAT3 and p300 (acetyltransferase) causing STAT3 activation
in a cytokine- and growth factor-independent manner
[30]. Thus, pharmacological targeting of CD44 may affect
different pathways in MM malignancies and be beneficial for
dexamethasone- and lenalidomide-resistant patients.
Here, we demonstrate that AR-42 down-regulates
CD44 protein and mRNA levels in vitro and in vivo. We
found that the molecular mechanism, by which AR-42
is able to decrease CD44 expression is through the upregulation of miR-9-5p, which directly targets and downregulates the RNA binding protein IGF2BP3, known to
physically bind to CD44 mRNA and increase its stability
[31]. Furthermore, we show that in a mouse model, AR42 it is able to increase the sensitivity of MM cells to
lenalidomide and the combination of both drugs has a
synergistic effect.

AR-42 down-modulates CD44 in myeloma cells
Growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic properties
of pan-HDACi, AR-42, have been reported previously
[25, 32, 33] in numerous malignancies, including
MM. Because of the potent immunomodulatory
effects observed with classical pan-HDACi’s [34],
we investigated whether immunology-related gene
networks were altered upon AR-42 treatment in MM
cells. We used nCounter technology to analyze the
effects of AR-42 on the expression of 511 human genes
in MM.1S cells. We chose a 24-hr treatment with 0.1 μM
AR-42, because we found that this treatment leads
to a detectable hyperacetylation of histone 3 and 4
(Supplementary Figure S1A), but without significant
increase of apoptosis, as measured by Annexin V-PI
staining in all MM cell lines tested (MM.1S, U266,
RPMI-8226, MM.1R) (Supplementary Figure S1B and
data not shown). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
analysis identified two distinct branches corresponding
to AR-42 treated and untreated cells (Figure 1A), and
showed that expression of numerous immunologyrelated genes was strongly altered (Supplementary Table
S1). Among the most significantly downregulated genes
(p < 0.001) were several cell membrane associated
proteins, including CD44 (Supplementary Table S1).
We focused on CD44 expression, because in
MM cells its expression correlates with cell adhesion
mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) [17–19] and it has
been shown to mediate resistance to dexamethasone [35]
and lenalidomide [26]. Using qRT-PCR validation, we
found that CD44 mRNA (Figure 1B) and protein levels
(Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure S1C) were consistently
downregulated by 24-hr treatment with AR-42 in a dosedependent fashion, as compared to the vehicle control
(DMSO; Ctrl). Reduction of CD44 mRNA and protein
persisted for 48 hrs after treatment (Supplementary Figure
S1C, S1D and data not shown). The down-regulation
of CD44 cell surface expression was also observed by
flow cytometry in all MM cell lines tested expressing
detectable CD44 levels (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure
S1E, S1F and data not shown). Of note, at 48 hrs of AR42 treatment we observed a consistent up-regulation of
CD48 at protein and mRNA levels (Figure 1E and data not
shown), supporting the idea that AR-42 mediated CD44
down-regulation is not simply associated with a global
down-regulation of the surface molecules of MM cells. We
also compared the effect of AR-42 with other HDACi’s in
clinical use and we found that cells treated with AR-42
showed greater CD44 downregulation, when compared
with SAHA, LBH589 and HDAC1/2 inhibitor (JQ12) and
used at comparable IC50 concentrations (0.2 μM AR-42,
1.0 μM SAHA, 0.01 μM LBH, and 0.5 μM JQ12) (Figure
1D–1E, Supplementary Figure S1G).

concentration (0.1, or 0.2 μM) for 24 hours. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering analysis produced a dendrogram,
in which samples are segregated according to class of
treatments (Figure 3C). We found that 51 miRNAs were
differentially expressed between the two groups, of which
29 were significantly down-regulated in cells treated with
AR-42 and the other 22 were up-regulated (Supplementary
Table S2). Since we were interested in defining the
mechanism of decreasing of CD44 expression by AR-42
via microRNA(s), we focused on miR’s upregulated by
the treatment. Stem loop real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
used to validate the most-upregulated miRNAs in several
cell lines (MM.1S, LP1, H929, and JJN3), which revealed
that miR-9-5p had the strongest response to the treatment
and its expression levels increased at 24 hrs in a dose
dependent manner when compared to the control treatment
(Figure 3D).
Because human miR-9-5p is encoded by three
distinct genomic loci, specifically primary (pri) -miR-9-1
on chromosome 1 (q22), pri-miR-9-2 on chromosome 5
(q14.3), and pri-miR-9-3 on chromosome 15 (q26.1), we
investigated which locus was responsible for miR-9 upregulation in response to AR-42. Quantitative RT-PCR
showed dose dependent changes in all primary transcripts
of miR-9-5p in AR-42-treated MM.1S cells, as compared
to controls, supporting the idea that all these chromosomal
regions contribute to miR-9-5p up-regulation upon AR-42
in MM cells (Figure 3E).

AR-42, while the second group (n = 4) was injected with
vehicle control (8% DMSO in PBS; Ctrl). Injections were
administered once a day (on Monday and Wednesday).
Because the anti-tumor activity of AR-42 has been
previously reported in preclinical mouse studies [33], in
order to avoid tumor size reduction mice were sacrificed 2
days after the second injection. Indeed, at this time point
the tumors were still comparable between the mouse
groups (Figure 2A). Tumors were excised and used for
CD44 immunohistochemical (IHC) studies, while the
serum was collected for ELISA assays. IHC analysis
of tumor sections revealed that the AR-42-treated mice
displayed significant lower CD44 staining compared with
the control group (Figure 2B). ELISA assays also showed
decreased levels of soluble CD44 in the serum of the mice
treated with AR-42 (Figure 2C). In conclusion, our data
demonstrate that AR-42 is able to down-regulate CD44
directly in vivo.

AR-42 modulates expression of microRNAs in
MM cells
To address the molecular mechanism(s) responsible
for downregulation of CD44 gene, we considered the
potential role of one or more cis regulatory regions. However,
to our surprise 24 hr treatment with 0.2 μM of AR-42 did
not lower the activity of CD44 promoter region in MM cells
(MM.1S, U266 and 293T ) (Supplementary Figure S2).
Therefore we turned our attention to the 3′UTR of CD44
and asked if inhibition of CD44 expression by AR-42 might
be mediated by microRNA(s) potentially upregulated by
AR-42 treatment. As the first step, we subcloned CD44
3′UTR element downstream from the SV40 promoterdriven luciferase gene and transiently transfected the
resulting reporter plasmid into MM.1S cells. Incubation
with 0.2 μM AR-42 for 24 hrs resulted in 35% decrease
in luciferase activity, as compared to untreated cells
(Figure 3A).
Since RNA ribonuclease, Drosha is critical during
the initial steps of microRNA processing [36], we tested
the effect of Drosha knock-down on CD44 expression
using specific siRNA. Figure 3B demonstrates that
inhibition of Drosha expression in MM.1S cells resulted
in 2-fold increase of CD44 protein levels. Thus, these
results support the idea that the down-modulation of CD44
expression by AR-42 is mediated by CD44 3′UTR and it
may involve upregulation of microRNA(s) targeting CD44
3′UTR.
To determine if miRNAs are regulated by AR-42
in MM cells at sub-lethal concentrations, we performed
a full-spectrum analysis of miRNA levels using
NanoString technology [37] with an expanded set of
probes capable of assaying the expression of more than
800 human miRNAs. We performed an array analysis of
global miRNA expression on RNA from MM.1S cells
grown in the presence or absence of AR-42 at different
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The CD44 mRNA binding protein IG2FBP3 is
the direct target of miR-9-5p
To determine if CD44 is a direct target of miR-9-5p,
we performed a bioinformatic search (Target Scan
[38], Pictar [39], and miRDB) for predicted miR-9-5p
binding site(s) in CD44 3′UTR, but we didn’t find any
(data not shown). Moreover, none of the microRNAs
identified in our NanoString assay to be upregulated by
AR-42, were predicted to bind to CD44 3′UTR (data
not shown). Therefore, we considered that miR-9-5p
may regulate CD44 expression in an indirect fashion. To
test this hypothesis, we transiently transfected MM.1S
cells with miR-9-5p precursor, or scramble control,
and measured CD44 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR 48 hrs
later. Figure 4A shows that in the miR-9-5p transfected
cells (+) CD44 expression is about 30% lower when
compared to scramble control transfected cells (−). In
the reciprocal experiment, MM.1S cells were transiently
transfected with antago-miR-9 (AS miR-9), or scramble
control (AS miR-SCR) and CD44 surface expression was
measured. As demonstrated in Figure 4B, inhibition of the
endogenous miR-9-5p increased more than two times the
population with high CD44 expression when compared to
cells transfected with scramble sequence (SCR). Taken
together, these results lend support to a critical role of
miR-9-5p in regulating CD44 expression in MM cells.

One possible mechanism could involve the
regulation of CD44 mRNA stability. Therefore, we
focused our attention on two related RNA binding
proteins, IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3, which bind and control
CD44 mRNA stability [40] in several cellular system and
their expression is tightly related to CD44 levels in several
forms of cancer [41]. STRING data analysis (http://stringdb.org) shows strong functional interaction between
IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3, and CD44 (Figure 4C). Using
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Targetscan [38], Pictar [39], and RNA22 [42] searches we
identified a highly conserved consensus sequence for miR9-5p in the 3′UTR of IGF2BP3, and a lower probability site
in the 3′UTR of IGF2BP1 (Figure 4D and data not shown).
To test if IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3 are bona fide targets
of miR-9-5p, we transfected MM cells with miR-9-5p
precursor, or scramble control and measured IGF2BP1 and
IGF2BP3 protein expression by western blot. In agreement
with the prediction, ectopic expression of miR-9-5p led

to a strong decrease of IGF2BP3 protein paralleled by
downregulation of CD44 protein, while the expression of
IGF2BP1 was not affected (Figure 4E). Ectopic expression
of another microRNA identified in our NanoString
experiment (miR-16) did not influence the protein
levels of IGF2BP3, CD44, or IGF2BP1 (Figure 4E),
thus demonstrating the specific effect of miR-9-5p. To
examine if miR-9-5p targets IGF2BP3 directly, we cloned
the portion of the IGF2BP3 3′UTR containing either
the wild type (Wt) or mutated (Mut) miR-9-5p site into
a pGL3-control luciferase vector. Luciferase activity

significantly decreased when the Wt reporter construct
was cotransfected into MM.1S cells with miR-9-5p, as
compared to scramble control (scr) (Figure 4F). This
effect was not observed when IGF2BP3 3′UTR with
a specific deletion of 2 nucleotides (Mut) in miR-9-5p
consensus sequence was tested (Figure 4F). In summary,
these data indicate that CD44 expression can be modulated
by changes in miR-9-5p levels, although indirectly.
Furthermore, we also discovered that miR-9-5p directly
targets IGF2BP3 (but not IGF2BP1), a stabilizer of CD44
mRNA [40].

AR-42 treatment sensitizes MM cells to
lenalidomide

To minimize toxicity and investigate a clinically relevant
treatment regimen, mice were treated with Len (50 mg/kg) or
VE by intraperitoneal injections daily, and AR-42 (25 mg/kg)
or VE 3 times per week for 3 weeks. Following treatments,
tumors were markedly suppressed in all AR-42/Len treated
mice compared to control and single agent [AR-42 vs.
Ctrl (p = 0.5); Len vs. Ctrl (p = 0.014); AR-42/Len vs. Len
(p = 0.0145); AR-42/Len vs. AR-42 (p = 0.0002)] (Figure
6A–6B). The extent of BM engraftment was determined by
flow cytometry using a human anti-CD138 antibody, and it
was evident that AR-42/Len treated mice showed significantly
less BM engraftment compared to the other treatment
groups [AR-42 vs. Ctrl (p = 0.8); Len vs. Ctrl (p = 0.8);
AR-42/Len vs. Len (p = 0.016); AR-42/Len vs. AR-42
(p = 0.01)] (Figure 6C). All mice treated with the AR-42/Len
combination displayed a longer survival when compared to
the mice treated with single agent. In fact, they all appeared
healthy and remained alive past the point, at which the last
mice in all other treatment groups were removed (Figure
6D–6E). Thus our data indicate that AR-42 in combination
with lenalidomide can be a valid therapeutic strategy to
increase lenalidomide sensitivity of MM cells in the BM niche.

Recently published data have shown that CD44
up-regulation in MM cells is associated with resistance
to lenalidomide [26]. Given the fact that AR-42 inhibits
expression of CD44 (Figures 1 and 2), we hypothesized that
AR-42 can sensitize MM cells to lenalidomide treatments.
Hence, we examined whether AR-42 treatment leads to
increased apoptosis in MM.1S cells upon exposure to
lenalidomide (Len). Indeed, as revealed by Annexin V
staining of MM.1S and MM.1R cells (Figure 5A and data
not shown), the addition of AR-42 (0.1 μM) to Len (2.5 μM)
resulted in a 4.9-fold increase in apoptosis at 48 hrs, relative
to Len alone, while the combination of 0.1 μM AR-42 and
5.0 μM Len resulted in a 5.8-fold increase (Figure 5A).
Next, we treated MM.1S cells with 0.1 and 0.2 μM AR-42 in
combination with different concentrations of Len (1–10 μM)
and measured their effects cell proliferation assay (MTT).
To calculate combination indices (CI) we utilized the ChouTalalay method [43]. We found that the combination of AR42 with Len showed strong synergism (CI < 1) in killing of
MM.1S cells (Supplementary Table S3).
Since MM cell survival is strongly dependent on
microenvironment [44–46], we decided to assess whether
AR-42 in combination with Len can increase MM cell killing
in the context of the bone marrow (BM) milieu. Total BM
samples obtained from 5 Len-refractory MM (patients 1, 2,
3, 4, and 7) and 3 newly diagnosed MM patients (patients
5, 6, and 8) were treated with AR-42 (0.2 μM) and Len
(5 μM) as single agents, and in combination. Following 48
hrs of treatment, multiparametric flow cytometry (diagrammed
in Figure 5B) showed a substantial increase of Annexin V
staining, specifically in the CD138+/CD38high MM cells
[47, 48] treated with AR-42 in combination with Len (p <
0.0001) (Figure 5C). In contrast, the CD138neg/CD38low BM
cellular fraction did not demonstrate significant evidence of
apoptosis following the combination treatment (Figure 5D).
Also peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the same
experimental conditions did not show induction of apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure S3). The BM cells from the same
patients were also used to assess CD44 expression at 24 hrs
after AR-42 treatment. Downregulation of CD44 was observed
in the whole BM of all 5 Len-refractory and 2 of the 3 newly
diagnosed MM patients (patients 5 and 8) (Supplementary
Figure S4).

DISCUSSION
Adhesion molecules play a key role in mediating
the interaction between MM cells and the extracellular
environment in bone marrow, including stromal cells and the
extracellular matrix [50, 51]. They also strongly contribute
to MM resistance to therapeutic intervention. Many primary
CD138+ MM cells have detectable surface expression of
CD44, CD49d, and CD54 (ICAM-1) [50, 51], and which
of those adhesion molecules is the most important remains
controversial. CD44 is the major cell surface receptor for
hyaluronan (HA) [52] and this interaction is important
for diverse biological functions, such as cell proliferation,
adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis [52, 53]. High
levels of CD44 are associated with drug resistance and
poor prognoses in various malignancies, mainly due to its
physical association with P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a product of
the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) [54–56].
CD44 is a downstream target of Wnt signaling
[57] and is considered one of the most important markers
of cancer stem cells (CSCs) [58]. Since HA is a major
component of the BM niche in MM patients, HA-CD44
interaction could be critical in regulating myeloma CSC
functions leading to increased myeloma CSC self-renewal
and chemoresistance, as shown in other forms of cancer
[59, 60]. Hence, we can speculate that the downregulation
of CD44 expression upon pan-HDACi treatment has the

The importance of CD44 expression in treatmentresistance of MM has been highlighted by the demonstration
that blocking CD44/HA interaction resulted in protecting
dexamethasone-induced apoptosis [35]. Furthermore, in a

lenalidomide in vivo
To investigate the effect of AR-42 and Len in vivo,
NOD-SCID mice (n = 40) were intravenously injected with 5
× 106 GFP+/Luc+ MM.1S cells [49]. After three weeks, mice
with similar tumor burden were selected and divided into 4
treatment groups (5 mice per group): AR-42 alone, Len alone,
AR-42/Len, and vehicle control (8% DMSO in PBS; VE).

recent in vitro study, Bjorklund et al. [26] showed the critical
role played by CD44 in resistance to lenalidomide. Thus,
therapeutic interventions involving regulation of CD44
provide an attractive strategy to overcome the drug resistance.
Interestingly, our NanoString profiling of the genes
affected by a novel HDACi, AR-42, identified CD44
as one of the genes downregulated by the drug. This is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

particularly important, since AR-42 is currently being tested
in phase I clinical trials for hematologic malignancies and
solid tumors [61]. Here we found that AR-42 treatments
down-modulate CD44 expression and sensitize MM
cells to lenalidomide. Although other HDACi’s can also
increase the sensitivity to lenalidomide affecting MM cell
line proliferation properties, as recently published [62], we

MATERIALS AND METHODS

show that clinically achievable concentrations of AR-42
display a greater ability to downregulate the drug resistance
marker, CD44 when compared to other pan-HDACi’s, not
only in cell lines but also in primary cells isolated from
lenalidomide resistant patients. Hence, we hypothesize that
AR-42 may be more suitable as an IMiD companion drug to
overcome mechanisms of resistance in relapsed patients. To
understand the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for AR42 induced inhibition of CD44 expression, we investigated
the involvement of two cis regulatory elements of CD44
gene: proximal promoter and the 3′UTR. We found that the
effect was mediated by the 3′UTR, therefore we speculated
that AR-42 may upregulate the expression of miRNA(s)
targeting the CD44 3′UTR. Although our NanoString
analyses identified many miRNAs that were differentially
expressed in MM cells treated with AR-42, none of them was
predicted to target the CD44 3′UTR. However, we discovered
that the most consistently up-regulated miRNA, miR-95p contributed to CD44 expression indirectly, by targeting
IGF2BP3, a protein described before to stabilize CD44
mRNA by binding to multiple sites in the CD44 3′UTR [31].
In addition, we cannot exclude that cryptic binding sites for
miRNAs, or other regulatory RNAs can also participate in
CD44 posttranscriptional regulation in MM cells. Previously
published data have shown that the members of miR30 family decrease CD44 expression in MM cells at the
transcriptional level through the downregulation of WNT/βcatenin pathway [57]. Interestingly, our miRNA profile and
qRT-PCR validation data (data not shown) showed that
miR-30a is significantly upregulated upon AR-42 treatment
in MM cells. However, we did not observe transcriptional
repression of the CD44 promoter in AR-42 treated MM cells,
supporting the idea that CD44 downregulation upon AR-42
treatment could be driven by different mechanisms.
We also observed that miR-9-5p up-regulation was
not exclusively achieved by the AR-42 treatment, but to a
lesser extent and in dose-independent mannerit could be
also modulated in vitro by other HDACi’s, including SAHA
and LBH589 (data not shown). We can speculate that in
MM cells this miRNA is under epigenetic control and its reexpression is a more common mechanisms associated with
the use of pan-HDACi’s. In fact, transcriptional suppression
of miR-9-5p by HDAC5 has been previously reported [63].
Recently published data show that that miR-9-5p
is also targeting Blimp-1 [64–66]. Based on these data
we can suppose that its expression can be beneficial in
patients treated with lenalidomide, but can be a limiting
factor for proteasome inhibitor (PI) treated patients, in
which Blimp-1 downregulation has been associated with
mechanisms of PI resistance [67].
CD44 expression is an important prognostic marker
in MM, as well as other cancers and cancer stem cells [68].
Therefore, the use of AR-42 may allow CD44 targeting
in numerous cancers that may both overcome resistance
to standard therapeutic agents, as well as open up new
treatment directions focused on cellular adhesion.

Cell lines
MM cell lines MM.1S Include MM.1R and JJN3
myeloma cell lines, NCI-H929, KMS11, KMS18, OPM2,
EJM, LP1, RPMI8226, U266 andL363 (courtesy of Dr. M.
Kuehl; National Cancer Institute) were cultured in RPMI1640 mediumsupplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS). HeLa (CCL-2) and 293T (CRL-3216)
were obtained from American Type Cell Collection (ATCC)
and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS.

MM cell line transfections
One million of MM.1S, U266, or L363 cells were
transfected by electroporation using Nucleofector 4D system
(Lonza). Specific nucleofection slolutions and programs were
optimized for each cell line. Briefly, cells were resuspended
in 100 μl of the nucleofector solution SF, 30 pmols of
microRNA (miR-9-5p precursor), antagomiR-9, miR-16-5p,
negative control miR precursor, or siRNAs (Drosha, or
scramble control) were added and transferred to a cuvette. All
RNA reagents were from Life Technologies. Program DS137 was used for MM.1S cells, program DN-100 for U266
and program DS-100 for L363. After electroporation, cells
were immediately plated out in pre-warmed medium onto 6
well plates. AR-42 treatments were performed 24 hrs later.

CD138+ plasma cell purification
CD138+ plasma cells (PCs) were purified from total
bone marrow of patients by Human WholeBlood CD138+
Selection Kit (Cat#18387, Stem Cell Technologies),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Yield and
purity of CD138+ cells was evaluated by flow cytometry
using anti-CD138 antibody (Becton Dickinson).

miRNA and mRNA profiling
Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen).
The RNA was analyzed by nCounter GX Human
Immunology Kit, or nCounter Human microRNA Kit,
as recommended by the manufacturer (NanoString
Technologies, Inc.). A total of 511 immunology related
genes and 800 microRNAs were profiled.

Bioinformatic analyses
Samples analyzed by NanoString assay were
normalized using the variance stabilization. The mean linkage
hierarchical clustering algorithm was conducted to identify
subgroups of significant miRNAs [69]. These results have
been obtained using both the Rank Product package (version
2.16.0) of the BioConductor Library, under the R System and
the Rank Product library in connection to the cluster analysis
module of the Tmev system [70]. The obtained data were
deposited in the GEO database (accession number).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Mutations in the miR-9-5p binding site of the IGF2BP3
3′UTR were introduced by the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit
(Stratagene) and the following primers:
(Forward) 5′-CAGAGGCAGATGCCAAACGGGG
TACAGATTG CTTAACC-3′ and (Reverse) 5′-GGTTAA
GCAATCTGTACCCCGTTTGGCATCTGCCTCTG-3′.

Blood from xenografted mice (0.6 ml/kg) was
collected by retro-orbital bleeding and serum was obtained
by centrifuging it at 1500 × g for 10 min. ELISA was
conducted as described by the manufacturer (Abcam).
Briefly, serum was diluted 1:40 in Standard Diluent Buffer
and 100 μl of each sample was plated in duplicate onto a 96well plate. Standard and 1x control solution were added to
the appropriate wells and incubated for 1 hr. All incubations
were conducted at room temperature, unless otherwise
noted. The plate was washed, biotinylated anti-CD44
added to each well and plate was incubated for 30 min. The
plate was washed again and 100 μl 1x Streptavidin-HRP
solution was added into each well, allowed to stand for
30 min. and washed again. Chromogen TMB substrate
(100 μl) was added to each well and incubated in the dark
for 15 min. Finally, 100 μl/well of Stop Reagent was added
and absorbance was read on a spectrophotometer at 450 nm.
Soluble CD44 (sCD44) content was calculated based on the
readings from the standard and sample dilution factor.

Luciferase assay
Hela and 293T cells were transfected with 500 ng
of 3′UTR-pGL3-control plasmid and 50 ng of Renilla
luciferase expression construct (pRL-TK; Promega), using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 hrs cells were
lysed and tested by Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MM.1S cells
were transfected with 1.8 μg of pGL3-based luciferase
vector and 200ng of pRL-TK, harvested 24 hrs later and
assayed as above.

mRNA and miRNA expression
Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was
performed with the TaqMan method (Applied
Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and analyzed with the 7900HT Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). The appropriate TaqMan
probes for mRNA, miRNA, and pri-miRNA quantification
were purchased from Applied Biosystems, and all
reactions were performed in triplicate. The following
probes were used: hsa-miR-9-5p (000583), hsa-mir-9-1
(Hs03303201_pri), hsa-miR-9-2 (Hs03303202_pri), hsamir-9-3 (Hs03293595_pri), CD44 (Hs01075861_m1),
IGF2BP3 (Hs00559907_g1). Simultaneous quantification
of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 (OAZ1), or
GAPDH mRNAs were used as a reference for mRNA data
normalization, while small endogenous nucleolar RNA
U44/U48, or U6 were used for miRNA normalization.
The relative expression levels were calculated by the
comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method (User Bulletin
#2; Applied Biosystems). Expression analyses of premiRNA was performed with SYBR green PCR master
mix (Applied Biosystems) and normalized for U6 RNA.
All primers used for amplification steps are listed in the
Supplementary materials and methods.

Immunoblotting
Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with
PBS and lysed using buffer composed of 50 mM Tris (pH
7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.0% NP-40, 0.1% SDS,
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors.
Protein concentrations were estimated by Bradford assay
and equivalent quantities of the lysates were resolved
on 4–20% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE TGX gels (Bio-Rad).
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and
stained for acetyl-histone H3 (Milipore), acetyl-histone
H4 (Milipore), IGF2BP1 (Cell Signaling Technology),
IGF2BP3 (IMP-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD44
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD48 (Abcam), Drosha (Cell
Signaling Technology), or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Cell Signaling Technology),
followed by anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (GE
Healthcare). Signals were developed using Pierce ECL
Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

DNA constructs
Human CD44 promoter-luciferase reporter gene
(CD44P pGL3) [71] was obtained from Addgene (Plasmid
19122). The 3′UTR of CD44 was PCR amplified using
following primers:
(Forward) 5′-gctagcCACCTACACCATTATCTTG -3′
and 5′- gctagcAATTCTTGGTGTTGTTATG-3′ (engineered
NheI sites are in lower case), and the products were cloned
into XbaI site downstream from the luciferase gene in pGL3control vector (Promega). To generate IGF2BP3 luciferase
reporter constructs, the 3′UTR was amplified by PCR using
primers: (Forward) 5′-TCTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATGA-3′
and (Reverse) 5′-TCTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATGA-3′,
and cloned into XbaI site of pGL3-control vector (Promega).

nescence 10 min. after the injection. The home-built
bioluminescence system used an electron multiplying
charge-coupled device (Andor Technology Limited)
with an exposure time of 30 sec. and an electron
multiplication gain of 500 voltage gain × 200, 5-by-5
binning, and with background subtraction. Images were
analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health).

Proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT
cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Immunohistochemistry

Animal experiments

Xenograft tumor samples were fixed in 10% neutralbuffered formalin embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at
4 μm. Slides were then placed in a 60°C oven for 1 hr,
cooled, deparaffinized, and rehydrated by passing slides
through xylene, a series of graded ethanol solutions, and
ending with water. All slides were placed for 5 min in a
3% hydrogen peroxide solution to block the endogenous
peroxidase. Antigen retrieval was performed by heat
induced epitope retrieval (HIER), in a citric acid solution,
pH 6.1, for 25 min at 96°C followed by cooling down for
15 min. Slides were placed on a Dako Autostainer and
sections were treated with primary antibodies for human
CD138 and CD44 followed by biotinylated secondary
antibodies and the DAB chromogen.

Animal experiments were performed according to
OSU institutional guidelines. To generate MM xenograft
model, 1 × 107 viable MM.1S cells were injected subcuta­
neously into the right flank of 12 5-week-old female nude
mice (Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu; Charles River). The tumor size
was measured once a week using a caliper, and the volume
was calculated in cubed millimeters (mm3), using the
formula L × W2/2. At 3 weeks after injection, a group of
8 mice with comparable tumor size (250 ± 60 mm3) were
randomly divided into two groups, using 4 mice for each
treatment. Mice were treated with intra-tumoral injection
of AR-42 (25 mg/kg) or DMSO (8% in PBS) once a day
on Monday and Wednesday. The day after the second
treatment, when the tumor sizes between the 2 different
groups were comparable, blood from mice was collected
by retro-orbital bleeding and the mice were sacrificed for
IHC analysis.
For studies involving AR-42 combination with
lenalidomide, GFP+/Luc+ MM.1S stable line [49] was
harvested during logarithmic growth phase, washed
with PBS and injected intravenously into NOD-SCID
nude mice (5 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml/mouse) under general
anesthesia (isoflurane, 2–4% to effect). Beginning at
7 days post-injection, mice were monitored every day
for the appearance of tumors by fluorescence using
in vivo Imaging System (IVIS). On day 15, when the
engraftment reached approximately ≥ 2 × 106photons/
sec/cm2/sr mice with similar tumor burden were divided
into different groups of treatments. Intraperitoneal
injections with vehicle control (8%DMSO in PBS), AR42 (25 mg/kg; Mon-Tue-Fri) and lenalidomide (50 mg/
kg, daily) were administered by intraperitoneal injection
under general anesthesia (isoflurane, 2–4% to effect).
Treatments for each mouse continued for 3 weeks, which
ended when the control group showed sign of disease,
including paralysis and extreme weight lost, or when
tumor mass was equivalent to 10% of body weight.

Statistics
All preclinical data were obtained from at least
three independent experiments and are expressed as mean
± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between groups
were performed using two-tailed t-tests, and comparisons
between multiple groups were performed using 1-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Mouse data were evaluated by ANOVA, and synergy
between AR-42 and Len was tested by interaction contrast.
To investigate Annexin-V and CD44 level in primary
patient samples, geometric mean values were analyzed
by using mixed effect model and incorporated repeated
measures for each sample. For the Annexin-V experiment,
p-values were adjusted by Holm’s method to control the
familywise error rate at 0.05. Other P values reported in
the manuscript were obtained by 2 tail t-test.
