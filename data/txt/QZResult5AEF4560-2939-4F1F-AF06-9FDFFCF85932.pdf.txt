BACKGROUND: This cooperative group adjuvant phase 2 trial in patients with completely resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer
with tumor diameters measuring  2 cm was designed to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of assigning patients to therapy or observation using a molecularly based decision algorithm. METHODS: At least a lobectomy and sampling of recommended
mediastinal lymph node stations, good Zubrod performance status, adequate organ function, and a formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded tumor specimen were required. Excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase M1
(RRM1) were analyzed using immunofluorescence-based in situ automated quantitative image analysis and categorized as high or low
using prespecified cutoff values. Patients with high ERCC1 and RRM1 were assigned to observation and all others to 4 cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine. Feasibility was defined as treatment assignment within 84 days from surgery in > 85% of patients. Secondary
objectives were to estimate the 2-year survival. RESULTS: Treatment assignment met the feasibility criteria in 88% of eligible patients
(71 of 81 patients). The collective 2-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 80% and 96%, respectively. Protein levels for
RRM1 fell within the previously established range, ERCC1 levels were slightly lower than expected, and they were significantly correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.4). The rates of assignment of patients to observation (22%) and chemotherapy (78%) were as
expected. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression analysis for treatment assignment is feasible. Survival results are encouraging and require
future validation. Real-time performance of quantitative in situ ERCC1 and RRM1 analysis requires further development. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
After publication of the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial in 2004, adjuvant chemotherapy containing a platinum
agent has become the standard of care for patients with a complete surgical resection of American Joint Committee on
Cancer stage II to III (version 6) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).1 The trial included patients with stage I to III disease and demonstrated an absolute 4.1% improvement in overall survival (OS), and a subgroup analysis indicated that the
OS benefit increased with stage: the hazards ratio (HR) for death among patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy compared with controls was approximately 0.98 for patients with stage I disease, 0.88 for patients with stage II disease, and
0.79 for patients with stage III disease.1 The data were confirmed by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 trial in 2005, which included patients with stage IB and stage II disease.2 A third trial, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9633, which included only patients with stage IB disease, was terminated early and also
reported a therapeutic benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy.3 However, a final analysis of mature data revealed no statistically
significant OS benefit (HR, 0.83), but demonstrated a benefit for patients with tumor diameters of  4 cm (HR, 0.69).4
During the same time period, an increasing number of correlative biomarker analyses demonstrated that the efficacy
of platinum agents was associated with intratumoral levels of the excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1)
gene, with high levels indicating resistance.5-9 Similarly, high intratumoral levels of the regulatory subunit of

ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) were reported to be
predictive of resistance to gemcitabine.9-13 Finally, both
biomarkers had also been reported to be prognostic of
survival in patients who had not received chemotherapy
or radiation, with high levels indicating longer
survival.8,14-16
Based on these data, we designed an adjuvant trial in
2007. The underlying hypothesis was that patients with
high intratumoral levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 would not
benefit from chemotherapy and would have a good prognosis because of a less aggressive tumor phenotype. In
contrast, patients with low levels of ERCC1 and RRM1
would have tumors that were sensitive to chemotherapy
but with a more aggressive phenotype. Because a
biomarker-driven adjuvant chemotherapy selection trial
had not been performed in patients with NSCLC, we
focused on demonstrating the feasibility of such an
approach before launching a phase 3 trial. In addition,
because adjuvant chemotherapy had quickly become the
standard of care for patients with stage II=IIIA disease, we
focused our efforts on patients with stage I disease. After
discussions within the SWOG (formerly the Southwest
Oncology Group) lung cancer working group and the
National Cancer Institute (NCI)’s Cancer Therapy
Evaluation Program, and after peer review by a National
Institutes of Health study section, the consensus was to
focus this feasibility trial on patients with stage I disease
and tumor diameters of 2 cm.

shipped to a central laboratory. They were analyzed for in
situ tumor levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 using an
immunofluorescence-based automated quantitative analysis method.17 Prespecified cutoff levels that had been
determined in 187 patients with stage I disease ( 65 for
ERCC1 and  40 for RRM1) were used to categorize
specimens as high or low expressors for each marker (Fig.
1).16 The appropriate therapeutic assignment was then
passed on to the statistical center and the participating
therapeutic center; however, specific protein levels were
not communicated to the treatment center. Therapeutic
assignment was based solely on biomarker categories, and
no other stratification parameters were used.
Patients with high levels of both biomarkers
received active surveillance and patients with low levels
of one or both biomarkers received 4 cycles of cisplatin
(at a dose of 80 mg=m2 on day 1) and gemcitabine (at
a dose of 1 g=m2 on days 1 and 8) every 21 days. The
protocol included provisions for dose reductions or
treatment delays. The addition of other targeted or cytotoxic agents during therapy or as maintenance was not
permitted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design and Treatment Plan

The trial (NCT00792701, SWOG-0720) complied with
the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the study institutions. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of NSCLC; stage I
disease (according to version 6 of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer staging manual) with a tumor diameter  2 cm; a complete surgical resection by lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy; surgical staging
of the mediastinum through sampling of at least 2 lymph
node stations; a positron emission tomography scan; a
computed tomographic scan of the chest and abdomen;
adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function; a
Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1; and willingness to
provide a smoking history. Patients with a prior malignancy, prior radiation to the chest, or other significant illnesses according to good medical practice were excluded.
Patients had to be registered on the trial within 35
days of surgery. Tumor specimens were then retrieved and

Specimen Collection, Processing, and Gene
Expression Analysis

The study required the collection and shipment of
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks
before therapy. However, if local policies did not permit
submission of a tissue block, 10 serial unstained sections
could be submitted. Processing was done in a reference
laboratory by 1 of 2 investigators (V.O. and Z.Z.). Sections measuring 5 lm in thickness were placed on frosted
glass slides, and in situ quantification was performed by
the automated quantitative analysis method (PM-2000
[version 1]; HistoRx Inc, New Haven, CT) as previously
described.9,16,18
The primary antibody for the detection of ERCC1
was clone 8F1 (product code NB500-704, lots G412 and
H347 from Novus Biologicals [Littleton, Colo]), and the
antiserum for RRM1 was R1AS-6 (generated in a rabbit
in 2003 against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin [KLH]-conjugated 21-aminoacid peptide specific to the N-terminal
of RRM1, column purification lot 09-2008). Slides were
scanned with SpotGrabber (HistoRx, New Haven,
Conn.), and image data were captured with a digital camera and fluorescence microscope and analyzed. Scores
were adjusted to range from 1 to 255. Because full sections
were evaluated for each specimen, multiple spots with
diameters of 0.6 mm were analyzed to obtain a representative level of protein expression. The number of spots was
dependent on suitable areas with tumor cells, and it
ranged from 5 to 25 spots (median, 10 spots) for both targets. Runs included a tissue microarray of 15 control
specimens in triplicate for control purposes.

every 2 months for the first 6 months and subsequently
every 3 months by computed tomography after enrollment and according to good medical practice. Toxicities
related to the administration of chemotherapy were
assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version
3.0; ctep.cancer.gov).
DFS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to disease recurrence or death due to any cause and
estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox
regression model was fit with the time from surgery to
enrollment as a covariate to evaluate its effect on DFS. A
natural log transformation was applied to the raw protein
measurement data, and the Pearson correlation coefficient
was used to test associations. Bivariate comparison of
baseline characteristics between the assigned treatment
groups was performed using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables or the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank
sum test for continuous variables. A multivariable logistic
model to evaluate baseline factors and treatment assignment was fit using backwards selection. Median ERCC1
and RRM1 expression levels were compared with historical medians using the 1-sample Wilcoxon signed rank
test. The percentage of patients with both ERCC1  65
and RRM1  40 was compared with the historical rate
using a chi-square test. All statistical analyses and graphics
were performed using SAS statistical software (version
9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). A significance level of
5% was used for all analyses.

Statistical Analysis

Patient and Trial Characteristics

The primary objective of the current study was the feasibility of a biomarker-based treatment assignment in the
cooperative group setting. If the true success rate were
 75%, then a biomarker-based treatment assignment
would not be considered feasible, but if the true success
rate were  90% it would be feasible. If  47 of 55 eligible patients (85%) were successfully assigned to treatment
or active monitoring within 84 days from surgery, this
would be considered evidence of feasibility. The design
had 91% power using an exact binomial test with a 1sided type I error of 5%.
Secondary objectives included estimating the collective 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) for patients who
accepted their treatment assignment and in the subset of
patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. However,
there would be no comparison made between treatment
arms. To assess DFS, the disease status was monitored

To ensure an adequate sample size of eligible patients and
biomarker-specific subgroups, a total of 85 patients was
registered between April 2, 2009 and April 1, 2011 from
27 participating sites. Four patients were ineligible; 3 had
inadequate lymph node sampling and 1 did not have a tumor measuring  2 cm. Table 1 provides the characteristics of the 81 eligible patients.
The distribution of assignment to chemotherapy
and observation was 63 patients (78%) and 18 patients
(22%), respectively, which was not significantly different
(P 5 .20, Fisher exact test) from the expected rates of
70% (129 patients) and 30% (55 patients), respectively.16 Based on protein levels in these 81 patients, the
number of those with low ERCC1 and low RRM1 was
31 patients (38%), 22 patients had low ERCC1 and high
RRM1 (27%), 10 patients had high ERCC1 and low
RRM1 (12%), and 18 patients had high ERCC1 and

prior results (P 5 .14, Fisher exact test; 54 of 184, 29%;
38 of 184, 21%; 37 of 184, 20%; and 55 of 184, 30%,
respectively).
We investigated whether treatment arm assignment
varied by patients’ smoking status, histology, age, and sex.
In bivariate comparisons, no statistically significant associations were found. However, the multivariable logistic
model found that patients with adenocarcinoma
(P 5 .03) and potentially stage IA disease (P 5 .06) were
more likely to be assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy (ie,
they were more likely to have low levels of ERCC1,
RRM1, or both).

One of the 18 patients assigned to observation and
19 of the 63 patients assigned to chemotherapy rejected
this choice and withdrew consent. There was no statistically significant difference in patient characteristics
between those who accepted and those who refused their
treatment assignment (Table 1).
Feasibility

The trial achieved its primary feasibility objective with a
treatment assignment within the prespecified timeframe
in 71 of 81 patients (88%). We successfully determined
protein levels in all 85 patients. Ten of the 81 eligible
patients did not achieve assignment to treatment

versus observation within the 84-day time interval
from surgical resection. The time interval from surgery
to assignment ranged from 86 days to 105 days in
these 10 patients. For 3 patients, the specimens were
received after the 84-day limit had passed. For the
other 7 patients, the time interval from receipt to
reporting ranged from 7 days to 25 days (median, 18
days). For the 71 patients with a successful assignment
within the 84-day time interval from surgical resection, the time from receipt to reporting ranged from 3
days to 26 days (median, 8 days). The reasons for
reporting results in excess of 14 days were equipment
failure and inadequate expression values in control
specimens, which required equipment recalibration
and a repeat processing of the specimens. Overall, the
time from receipt of specimens to reporting ranged
from 1 day to 27 days (median, 11 days; mean, 12
days), which is similar to that reported for patients
with advanced NSCLC (range, 1 day-47 days; median,
11 days; mean, 12 days).18
Survival and Toxicity

Survival analyses were performed on the 61 patients
who accepted assignment to treatment (44 patients) or
surveillance (17 patients). Patients who rejected their
treatment assignment withdrew consent and thus could
not be followed for survival. Fourteen patients had
DFS events; 2 had died (1 from disease recurrence and
the other from cardiac disease without recurrence). The
median follow-up among those patients still alive at
the time of last follow-up was 27 months (range, 3
months-44 months). Six patients had < 24 months of
follow-up.
The collective 2-year DFS and OS rates were 80%
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 67%-88%) (Fig. 2A)
and 96% (95% CI, 87%-99%) from the date of registration. The 2-year DFS rate was 83% (95% CI, 68%-92%)
for patients who received chemotherapy (Fig. 2B), and it
was 71% (95% CI, 43%-87%) for those observed (Fig.
2C). Table 2 includes 2-year DFS estimates within each
of the 3 gene expression categories in the chemotherapy
arm. The median time from surgery to enrollment was 41
days (range, 11 days-79 days). The time from surgery was
added as a covariate to a Cox regression model and was
not found to be significantly related to DFS (P 5 .22) or
OS (P 5 .36).
A total of 22 patients discontinued chemotherapy
because of treatment-related toxicity (50%). None of the
patients died because of treatment-related toxicity. Details
are provided in Table 3.

the expected values (median, 40.5; range, 8.3-96.2)
(P 5 .87).16 ERCC1 protein levels ranged from 4.3 to
211.2 (median, 41.9; mean, 58.8), and these values were
significantly different from the expected values (median,
65.9; range, 1.9-178.7) (P 5 0.02). There was a significant correlation noted between ERCC1 and RRM1 levels
(correlation coefficient, 0.39; P 5 .0003) (Fig. 3), as previously reported.9,16,18

The median protein levels of ERCC1 in adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and the other histologies were 34.2, 57.1, and 121.5, respectively. The
corresponding median levels of RRM1 were 38.1, 42.6,
and 48.9, respectively. Although the levels were higher in
squamous cell carcinomas compared with adenocarcinomas, the medians were not statistically significant
(ERCC1: P 5 .16; RRM1: P 5 .72).

disease derive the most benefit and those with stage I are
reported to derive the least.1,2,4,19-23 Although not statistically significant, for patients with stage I disease and a tumor diameter > 3 cm, a numerical risk reduction of 7%
has been reported and for those with tumors measuring
 3 cm a numerical risk increase of 40% has been
reported.23 A significant treatment-related toxicity is febrile neutropenia, which has been reported in 7% to 24%
of patients.2,4,20,22 Treatment-related deaths occur in
0.5% to 2% of patients.1,2,20,22 The inclusion of molecular markers predictive of therapeutic efficacy into adjuvant
decision algorithms would greatly improve the clinical
benefit and reduce toxicity for patients with NSCLC.
This approach is particularly attractive for patients with
stage I disease, in whom the parameters for weighing risks

and benefits are to our knowledge the least well defined.
Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in
improved outcomes for patients whose tumors harbor
mutations in oncogenic signal transduction molecules
that can be inactivated by therapeutic agents. Similarly,
platinum agents target DNA, and gemcitabine targets
ribonucleotide reductase; both are unequivocally required
not only for cellular proliferation but also for other essential cellular functions. Although to our knowledge specific
oncogenic mutations have not been identified to date,
ERCC1 and RRM1 have emerged as promising predictors of efficacy for cisplatin and gemcitabine, respectively.
We conducted a phase 2 trial of treatment selection based
on the levels of protein expression of ERCC1 and RRM1
for patients with completely resected stage I NSCLC and
tumor diameters  2 cm primarily to establish feasibility
but also to evaluate preliminary efficacy as assessed by 2year survival rates.
We achieved our primary goal by demonstrating
within a cooperative group environment that treatment
assignment can be achieved for > 85% of patients within
84 days (12 weeks), the established timeframe for the initiation of adjuvant therapy from surgery in patients with
NSCLC.1,2,4,20-22 At first glance, our demonstration of
feasibility should not be surprising. However, it is important to note that surgical practice has not usually engaged
a medical oncologist at the time of initial therapeutic
planning but rather after complete recovery, which substantially reduces the time available for molecular testing
before the initiation of adjuvant treatment. We found no
difference (P 5 .20) between academic and community
sites in the time elapsed from surgery to the receipt of
specimens in the reference laboratory (community sites:
57 patients; median, 48 days [range, 18 days-90 days];
academic sites: 24 patients; median, 53 days [range, 20
days-90 days]). The time elapsed from specimen receipt
to reporting (median, 12 days; range, 1 day-27 days) was
similar to our previous experience in an international trial
of patients with advanced NSCLC (median, 11 days;
range, 1 day-47 days).18 Based on these observations, we
conclude that the current process for routine specimen
procurement, handling, and shipping to a reference laboratory requires substantial improvements to facilitate
implementation of molecularly based therapeutic
decision-making. For example, a developing National
Cancer Institute-sponsored project, Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing
Trial (ALCHEMIST) which will randomize patients with
epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated or anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged NSCLC to targeted

therapy or not, will need to carefully consider these logistical issues.
Prior results from adjuvant trials and a retrospective
staging project in patients with stage I disease after complete surgical resection have reported 2-year DFS rates of
72% to 74%20 and rates of 68% to 75% for patients with
stage IB disease.4 The corresponding 2-year OS rates were
80% to 88% for patients with stage I disease20,24 65% to
90% for patients with stage IB disease,2,4,22,25 and 85%
for those with stage IA disease.25 Thus, our results of a 2year DFS rate of 80% and OS rate of 96% appear favorable by comparison. However, it is prudent to be cautious
because we lost 20 of 81 patients from the survival analysis
because of consent withdrawal, and a direct comparison
of outcomes data among trials cannot account for differences in study populations, eligibility and staging criteria,
and provisions for data collection and analysis.
The spectrum of protein levels for ERCC1 and
RRM1, significant correlation of levels between both molecules, and distribution of patients into the 4 gene expression categories in the current study is consistent with
previous experience.9,12,13,16,18,26 However, the current
analysis method for biomarker evaluation (ie, antibodybased assessment of in situ protein levels) is not suitable
for general clinical implementation for several reasons.
First, ERCC1 has multiple isoforms that cannot be specifically distinguished by the available reagents, and only 1
isoform appears to be involved in platinum-induced
DNA damage repair.27 Second, the monoclonal antibody
8F1, which is consistently used for ERCC1 protein
expression analysis, detects a second and unrelated protein
that shares a common epitope with ERCC1.28-30 This observation may account for the highly batch-dependent
performance of this antibody,18,27 which may explain the
significantly lower ERCC1 values in the current study
compared with prior results.16 Third, protein levels for
RRM1 in particular, and to a lesser degree for ERCC1,
appear to be influenced by the specimen processing and
handling procedures used at collection sites.26 Finally,
although the method for immunofluorescence-based
quantitative detection of both molecules performs well if
all specimens to be analyzed are processed simultaneously,
there is considerable interassay variability if specimens
need to be processed individually over an extended
period of time as required for real-time patient decisionmaking.18 However, it is important to note that the
biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological evidence
for ERCC1 and RRM1 as predictive molecules for
platinum and gemcitabine efficacy remains undisputed.5,10-12,27,31,32

Original Article

A small number of recent clinical trials have used
ERCC1 prospectively for therapeutic decision-making.
These include 2 randomized phase 3 trials in patients with
advanced-stage NSCLC (1 published [NCT00499109]18
and the other terminated and unpublished
[NCT00801736]) and 2 adjuvant trials, 1 of which was a
terminated and not yet published phase 2 trial [TAilored
Post-Surgical Therapy in Early Stage NSCLC (TASTE),
NCT00775385] and the other an ongoing phase 3 trial
[International TAilored Chemotherapy Adjuvant trial
(ITACA); EudraCT 2008-001764-36]. Results from the
first trial (NCT00499109) demonstrated no improvement in patient survival; however, the authors raised the
possibility of a false-negative result because of an inexplicably divergent survival in an internal control group.18
The second trial (NCT00801736) and third trial
(NCT00775385) were terminated early after the discovery of ERCC1 isoforms27 and specificity problems with
the 8F1 antibody.28-30 The fourth trial is using ERCC1
and tumor thymidylate synthase mRNA expression levels
for treatment assignment compared with a cisplatin-based
control treatment with OS as the primary endpoint and a
planned accrual of 700 patients. Results from these trials
will help to further delineate the feasibility and technical
issues mentioned above.
The results of the current study demonstrated
the feasibility of our biomarker-based decision algorithm in a multiinstitutional cooperative group environment for patients with surgically resected NSCLC. We
identified that the current practice of evaluation and
treatment for these patients may present an obstacle to
rapid molecular-based decision-making. Although
encouraging efficacy data emerged from this trial, bioassays that specifically measure platinum-induced DNA
damage repair must be developed before further clinical
trials are launched that seek to tailor the use of these
agents.
