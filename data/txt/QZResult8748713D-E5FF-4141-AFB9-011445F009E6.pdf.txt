Abstract
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is particularly important for the survival and
proliferation of melanoma cells. Somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS are frequently observed in melanoma.
Recently, the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have emerged as promising agents for the
treatment of melanoma patients with BRAF-activating mutations. However, as BRAF inhibitors induce RAF
paradoxical activation via RAF dimerization in BRAF wild-type cells, rapid emergence of acquired resistance
and secondary skin tumors as well as presence of few effective treatment options for melanoma bearing wildtype BRAF (including NRAS-mutant melanoma) are clinical concerns. Here, we demonstrate that the selective
pan-RAF inhibitor TAK-632 suppresses RAF activity in BRAF wild-type cells with minimal RAF paradoxical
activation. Our analysis using RNAi and TAK-632 in preclinical models reveals that the MAPK pathway of
NRAS-mutated melanoma cells is highly dependent on RAF. We also show that TAK-632 induces RAF
dimerization but inhibits the kinase activity of the RAF dimer, probably because of its slow dissociation from
RAF. As a result, TAK-632 demonstrates potent antiproliferative effects both on NRAS-mutated melanoma
cells and BRAF-mutated melanoma cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors through NRAS mutation
or BRAF truncation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of TAK-632 and the MAPK kinase
(MEK) inhibitor TAK-733 exhibits synergistic antiproliferative effects on these cells. Our ﬁndings characterize
the unique features of TAK-632 as a pan-RAF inhibitor and provide rationale for its further investigation in
NRAS-mutated melanoma and a subset of BRAF-mutated melanomas refractory to BRAF inhibitors. Cancer

Introduction
Melanoma is one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms
of skin cancer, arising from the malignant transformation of
pigment-producing cells, melanocytes (1). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is particularly important for the survival and proliferation of melanoma cells (2, 3).
Since oncogenic mutations frequently occur in components of
the MAPK pathway in melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, and KRAS in
approximately 45%, 18%, and 2%, respectively; ref. 4), research
and development targeting the MAPK pathway has been
extensively performed (2, 5, 6).
Recently, it has been reported that the BRAF inhibitors

line) showed high response rates and improved overall survival
in melanomas with BRAF-activating mutations (7–12). Thus,
the rationale for targeting BRAF to treat BRAF-mutant melanomas is strongly demonstrated. However, several reports have
shown that BRAF inhibitors activate RAF in BRAF wild-type
cells by inducing RAF dimer formation (13–15). Since the
paradoxical activation of RAF requires cooperation with RAS,
it does not occur in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells in which
BRAF activates downstream components in a RAS-independent manner (16, 17). Therefore, while vemurafenib showed
comparable inhibitory activity to all RAF isoforms in in vitro
kinase assays (7), it suppressed cellular RAF activity exclusively
in BRAF-mutant cells (18, 19). Such a RAF inhibitor is categorized as a "BRAF inhibitor," which demonstrates preferential
inhibition of the MAPK pathway and proliferation of BRAFmutated melanoma cells. On the other hand, a lack of such a
treatment option for melanomas with wild-type BRAF remains
an unresolved clinical issue. A subset of these tumors contains
activating mutations in NRAS, implying the relevance of the
MAPK pathway. These observations warrant the development
of a small-molecule inhibitor that suppresses RAF activity
without inducing RAF paradoxical activation for the treatment
of NRAS-mutated melanomas (here referred to as "pan-RAF
inhibitor").
Although the response of BRAF inhibitors to BRAF-mutant
melanomas is apparent, rapid development of acquired

resistance has been observed (11, 12). Many resistance
mechanisms have been identiﬁed to date (16, 20–27), and most
involve reactivation of the MAPK pathway, which suggests that
tumor survival and growth remains dependent on the MAPK
pathway. However, as many resistance mechanisms (e.g.,
RAS mutation, CRAF overexpression, and BRAF truncation;
refs. 16, 21, 25) involve RAF dimer signaling and thus the
potential for RAF paradoxical activation by BRAF inhibitors,
a pan-RAF inhibitor may be useful to develop a new therapeutic option in these resistant settings.
In this preclinical study, we describe the biologic characterization of TAK-632 (28) as a potent and selective pan-RAF
inhibitor that overcomes paradoxical RAF activation. We
used both genetic and chemical approaches to investigate
the dependence of NRAS-mutated melanoma and BRAF
inhibitor-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cells on RAF.
In addition, we explored the potential of TAK-632 as a
monotherapy and in combination with a MEK inhibitor to
robustly suppress MAPK pathway activation in melanoma
cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
Human ﬁbroblast Cell System-Fb (CsFb) cells were obtained from Cell Systems Corporation, GAK cells from the
Health Science Research Resources Bank, HMV-II cells from
European Collection of Cell Cultures, and other cell lines from
American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were cultured at 37 C with 5% CO2 in the recommended medium
supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). The cell lines were
authenticated by the cell banks with short-tandem repeat
proﬁling and used within 2 months after resuscitation. A375
stable cells (AcGFP-mock, -NRASQ61K, and -DN-BRAF cells)
were established by virus transduction and cultured in the
presence of 1 mg/mL puromycin.
Reagents
TAK-632 (28) and TAK-733 (29) were synthesized by Takeda
Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Vemurafenib was prepared
according to a published method (7).
Transfection, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot
analysis
Cells were transfected with plasmids or siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 or RNAi MAX reagent (Invitrogen), respectively. Details of immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
are described in the Supplementary Methods.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed (3 replicates) using the Sulforhodamine B assay or by the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). The concentrations of chemical compounds that produced 50% growth inhibition (GI50) were
calculated using PCP software (SAS Japan). The combination
index (CI) was calculated using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).
CI < 0.9, CI ¼ 0.9–1.1, and CI > 1.1 indicate synergism, additive
effect, and antagonism, respectively.

Kinase assay
Immunoprecipitated BRAF or CRAF was incubated with
recombinant inactive MEK (K97R) (Millipore) at 30 C for 30
minutes in kinase reaction buffer containing ATP/Mg2þ. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Animal study
A solid dispersion (SD) formulated compound was dissolved
in distilled water, and the resultant suspension was orally
administered to xenograft-implanted nude mice. All the animals were dosed with vehicle (SD powder formulated in water)
or compound suspension by oral gavages. Additional details
are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

Results
TAK-632 suppresses the MAPK pathway without robust
RAF paradoxical activation in multiple cell lines
To screen for pan-RAF inhibitors, we evaluated MAPK
pathway regulation in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells and
ﬁbroblast cells. Since we observed that the MAPK pathway of
ﬁbroblast cells was activated by BRAF inhibitors via RAF
paradoxical activation, we explored RAF inhibitors that suppressed the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells
but did not activate that in ﬁbroblast cells. Some of our (5,6)fused bicyclic class inhibitors achieved these criteria. Eventually, among the screened RAF inhibitors, TAK-632 was selected
as a candidate for further development (28). Potent and
selective inhibition of RAF by TAK-632 was conﬁrmed by a
panel of in vitro kinase assays (IC50 of BRAF ¼ 8.3 nmol/L,
CRAF ¼ 1.4 nmol/L, BRAF-V600E ¼ 2.4 nmol/L; ref. 28). We
also conﬁrmed RAF kinase inhibition by vemurafenib (IC50 of
BRAF ¼ 64 nmol/L, CRAF ¼ 90 nmol/L, BRAF-V600E ¼ 43
nmol/L, comparable to the reported IC50 values; ref. 7) and
used vemurafenib as a representative BRAF inhibitor in following studies.
Here, to formally characterize its cellular activity, we initially
compared the effect of TAK-632 with vemurafenib on the
MAPK pathway in BRAF mutant A375 cells, which have demonstrated sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors (27). Consistent with
the inhibitory activities to puriﬁed RAF, TAK-632 exhibited
relatively high inhibitory activities on MEK and ERK phosphorylation compared with vemurafenib, although the difference was not signiﬁcant (Supplementary Fig. S1A; IC50 of TAK632 for pERK ¼ 25 nmol/L and IC50 of vemurafenib for pERK ¼
75 nmol/L). To investigate the effect of TAK-632 on BRAF wildtype cells in detail, we tested multiple cell lines with wild-type
RAS/RAF, cell lines with KRAS mutations, and NRAS-mutated
melanoma cell lines. We found that TAK-632 had a biphasic
effect on the MAPK pathway: MEK and ERK phosphorylation
was modestly induced at low TAK-632 concentrations but
inhibited at higher concentrations in BRAF wild-type cells
(Fig. 1A). Although many ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors
increase MEK and ERK phosphorylation in cells with wildtype RAF (15), interestingly, paradoxical activation by TAK-632
appeared to be weak and occurred at low concentrations.
Notably, this weak paradoxical activation occurred in a similar
pattern in the cells; however, the MAPK pathway of NRAS-

mutated melanoma cells was suppressed by TAK-632 at lower
concentrations than that of other cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, as
reported previously, vemurafenib signiﬁcantly induced RAF
paradoxical activation in NRAS-mutated melanoma cells in a
biphasic manner (Supplementary Fig. S1B; ref. 18). We also
compared the effect of TAK-632 on the MAPK signaling with
the potent MEK inhibitor TAK-733 (29). Western blot analysis
revealed that the inhibitory activity to ERK phosphorylation of
TAK-733 in A375 cells was comparable to that in SK-MEL-2
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Meanwhile, the inhibition of
ERK phosphorylation by TAK-632 was relatively weak in SKMEL-2 cells compared to the inhibition in A375 cells (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Fig. S1A), suggesting that the minimal RAF
paradoxical activation by TAK-632 reduces its inhibitory activity at low concentrations. Thus, our data indicate that TAK-632
displays potent inhibition of MAPK pathway in NRAS-mutated
melanoma cells with minimal RAF paradoxical activation,

although the inhibitory activity was relatively weak compared
to that in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.
To investigate the relative sensitivity to TAK-632 in NRASmutated melanoma cells, we performed knockdown analysis
using siRNA to each RAF isoform. We found that ARAF depletion by siRNA did not affect MEK and ERK phosphorylation but
BRAF or CRAF depletion decreased it in multiple NRAS-mutated melanoma cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, simultaneous BRAF
and CRAF depletion suppressed MEK and ERK phosphorylation
more robustly than each siRNA alone (Fig. 1B). The data suggest
that BRAF and CRAF but not ARAF dominantly regulate the
MAPK pathway in NRAS-mutated melanoma cells.
RAF dimer formation mediates RAF paradoxical
activation by TAK-632
BRAF inhibitors reportedly induce RAF paradoxical activation through RAF dimer formation (13–15). Therefore, we

Nakamura et al.

investigated whether RAF dimer formation is responsible for
paradoxical activation by TAK-632. When SK-MEL-2 cells were
treated with TAK-632, the inhibitor induced the formation of
BRAF–CRAF dimers, detectable in coprecipitation experiments, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, top).
We also observed an increase in BRAF–CRAF dimers in
vemurafenib-treated cells, albeit at higher concentrations than
those in TAK-632 (Fig. 2A, top). Such modest RAF dimerization
was also observed in PLX4720, a precursor analog of vemurafenib (14, 30, 31). With regard to the effects of TAK-632 and
vemurafenib on RAF dimerization, similar results were
obtained in KRAS-mutant A549 cells (Fig. 2B, top). Interestingly, the level of MEK and ERK phosphorylation induced by
RAF inhibitors was the maximum at lower concentrations than
those required to induce maximal RAF dimer formation (Fig.
2A and B). The data support the model that the paradoxical
activation of the MAPK pathway is mediated by RAF dimers in
which one protomer is occupied by the RAF inhibitor and
another is not (13, 15). At higher concentrations of RAF
inhibitors, more RAF dimers are formed; however, both protomers tend to be occupied by inhibitors, resulting in effective
inhibition of kinase activity (Supplementary Fig. S2).

To demonstrate the signiﬁcance of RAF in the paradoxical
activation of the MAPK pathway, we examined the effect of
TAK-632 in RAF-depleted cells. The paradoxical activation
induced by TAK-632 and vemurafenib was suppressed by CRAF
depletion in SK-MEL-2 cells (Fig. 2C). Similar data was
obtained in KRAS-mutant cells (data not shown). In these
experiments, we used the most appropriate concentration of
each inhibitor that induced the paradoxical activation of the
MAPK pathway (TAK-632, 10 nmol/L and vemurafenib, 1,000
nmol/L; Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1B). These results are
consistent with previous reports using BRAF inhibitors (13–
15), indicating that CRAF is particularly required for RAF
paradoxical activation induced by TAK-632.
Although we have shown that TAK-632 induced modest RAF
paradoxical activation and RAF dimerization, a direct link
between them remains to be determined. To clarify whether
TAK-632–mediated paradoxical activation was attributed to
RAF dimerization, we prepared plasmids encoding the dimer
interface mutants E586K-BRAF and E478K-CRAF, which dimerize easily (13, 32), and evaluated the contribution of RAF dimer
formation to paradoxical RAF activation. Unlike the biphasic
effects observed in control cells, the paradoxical activation of the

Characterization of a Novel Selective Pan-RAF Inhibitor

MAPK pathway was not detected in response to TAK-632
treatment of cells coexpressing E586K-BRAF and E478K-CRAF
(Fig. 2D). Therefore, dimerization of RAF appears to be associated with minimal activation of the MAPK pathway by TAK-632.
Inhibitor off-rate affects RAF dimer activation/
inhibition
To directly determine the modulation of cellular RAF kinase
activity by RAF inhibitors, we performed immunoprecipitation–kinase assays. Consistent with the effect on MEK or ERK
phosphorylation observed in SK-MEL-2 cell lysates (Fig. 2A,
bottom), TAK-632 slightly activated kinase activity detected in
CRAF or BRAF immunoprecipitates at low concentrations and
suppressed these kinase activities at higher concentrations
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). On the other hand,
vemurafenib increased RAF activities in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A),
which was different from the effects on MEK and ERK phosphorylation in cell lysates (Fig. 2A, bottom). Similar observations have been reported for other BRAF inhibitors (13). Taken
together, RAF kinase activities in immunoprecipitates and
MEK and ERK phosphorylation in cell lysates were well correlated in TAK-632–treated cells but not in BRAF inhibitortreated cells, suggesting differences in the proﬁle between panRAF and BRAF inhibitors.
Since the kinase activity of RAF dimers is suppressed only
when both protomers are occupied by inhibitors, we suspected
that a difference in inhibitor off-rate from RAF may contribute
to the abovementioned gap. In fact, TAK-632 displayed a very
long residence time to puriﬁed wild-type RAF (28) and
PLX4720 demonstrated fast dissociation kinetics and a short
residence time (13, 28). In addition to the data in cell-free
conditions, washout assay revealed that the inhibition of MEK
phosphorylation by TAK-632 was partially rescued but
remained suppressed 2 hours after medium replacement in
SK-MEL-2 cells, whereas the increased MEK phosphorylation
by vemurafenib mostly returned to the basal level in 2 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Next, to investigate the importance of
the off-rate in suppressing the kinase activity of RAF dimers,
RAF inhibitors were added to the reaction mixture containing
immunoprecipitated RAF and kinase assay was performed
(described here as "in vitro-treated"). In this analysis, we
examined whether in vitro-treated BRAF inhibitor could suppress immunoprecipitated RAF that had been preactivated by
treatment with the inhibitor in cells. Notably, in vitro-treated
vemurafenib suppressed paradoxically activated RAF, indicating that the inhibitor could inhibit the kinase activity of RAF
dimers at adequate concentrations (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Thus, our data suggest two possibilities: First, a fast
off-rate RAF inhibitor partially dissociates from RAF dimers in
a standard immunoprecipitation–kinase assay procedure and
the residual inhibitor then reinduces allosteric transactivation.
Second, a fast off-rate RAF inhibitor dissociates from immunoprecipitated RAF; however, another activating mechanism
contributes to paradoxical activation, such as relief from
inhibitory autophosphorylation (33). Importantly, the slow
off-rate of TAK-632 can also explain why TAK-632 suppresses
both MEK phosphorylation in cell lysates and RAF kinase

www.aacrjournals.org

activity in RAF immunoprecipitates with minimal paradoxical
activation because slow off-rate compounds persistently occupy both protomers through prolonged binding.
TAK-632 inhibits the kinase activity of RAF dimer
To examine the effects of RAF inhibitors on the kinase
activity of RAF dimers in cells, we expressed dimerizationprone or dimerization-incompetent RAF mutants (13, 32) in
BRAF-mutated A375 cells, in which endogenous BRAF functions as a monomer (16, 17). In cells expressing dimerizationincompetent mutants (R509H-BRAF and R401H-CRAF), TAK632 and vemurafenib inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation
as seen in control cells (Fig. 3C, bottom). Notably, TAK-632
suppressed MEK and ERK phosphorylation derived from
dimerization-prone mutants (Fig. 3C, bottom). These data
revealed that in contrast to existing BRAF inhibitors (13),
TAK-632 suppresses activated BRAF–CRAF heterodimers (Fig.
3C). The interaction between dimerization-prone mutants was
hardly detected in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells but
was induced in RAF inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 3C, top),
suggesting that the endogenous BRAFV600E/MEK/ERK pathway stimulates a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit RAF
dimerization in BRAF-mutant A375 cells (17).
The formation of CRAF–CRAF homodimers by PLX4720
reportedly mediated paradoxical RAF activation (13). To examine whether CRAF homodimer formation is also induced by
TAK-632, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using
A375 cells expressing CRAF with a distinct size tag (HAFLAG-CRAF and GFP-CRAF). HA-FLAG-CRAF was coprecipitated with GFP-CRAF in a concentration-dependent manner
by TAK-632 and vemurafenib (Fig. 3D, top). Furthermore, the
RAF kinase assay revealed that TAK-632 slightly activated GFPCRAF at low concentrations and suppressed it at higher
concentrations in cells coexpressing HA-FLAG-BRAF/GFPCRAF and HA-FLAG-CRAF/GFP-CRAF, respectively. Meanwhile, vemurafenib increased these activities in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3D, bottom bars). Similar results
were obtained by using SK-MEL-2 cells expressing dimerization-prone mutants (Supplementary Fig. S5). Thus, our ﬁndings suggest that TAK-632 blocks the activity of both RAF
heterodimers and homodimers by prolonged binding to RAF.
Antiproliferative effect of TAK-632
To investigate the antiproliferative activity of TAK-632, we
performed proliferation assays in various cell lines harboring
mutated BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS. Although TAK-632 exhibited
antiproliferative activity in various types of cancer cells, BRAFand NRAS-mutated melanoma cells appeared to be more
sensitive to TAK-632 (Table 1). These results are consistent
with the observation that the MAPK pathway is easily suppressed by TAK-632 in BRAF- or NRAS-mutated melanoma
cells (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Meanwhile, TAK733 showed stronger antiproliferative effects than TAK-632
both in A375 and SK-MEL-2 cells (GI50 of TAK-632 ¼ 40–190
nmol/L, TAK-733 ¼ 6 nmol/L in A375 cells and GI50 of TAK-632
¼ 190–250 nmol/L, TAK-733 ¼ 11 nmol/L in SK-MEL-2 cells).
The data are also consistent with the inhibitory activities to
ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A and

S1C). Next, we examined the in vivo efﬁcacy of TAK-632 in
NRAS-mutant melanoma using a SK-MEL-2 xenograft model.
TAK-632 exhibited potent antitumor efﬁcacy when orally
administered at 60 mg/kg once daily (T/C ¼ 37%, P < 0.001)
or at 120 mg/kg once daily (T/C ¼ 29%, P < 0.001) for 21 days
without severe toxicity (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis in
parallel studies of mice treated for 3 days revealed signiﬁcant
reductions of ERK phosphorylation in SK-MEL-2 tumors from
animals treated with 60 or 120 mg/kg TAK-632 compared with
that in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4B and C). The data indicate
that antitumor activity and MAPK pathway inhibition are well
correlated in the model.
TAK-632 suppresses the MAPK pathway in
vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells
One of the major clinical challenges is to overcome the
acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of
patients with melanoma (11, 12). To preclinically examine the
effects of TAK-632 on several known mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance (20, 21, 26), we expressed wild-type NRAS,
NRAS with activating mutation (G12D, G13D, Q61K, or Q61R),
KRAS with activating mutation (G12V), and COT in A375 cells.
Although the MAPK pathway in cells expressing wild-type
NRAS, mutated NRASs, and KRASG12V is resistant to vemurafenib as reported previously (15, 21), TAK-632 suppressed
MEK and ERK phosphorylation in these cells as seen in control
cells (Fig. 5A–C). On the other hand, COT conferred resistance
to both TAK-632 and vemurafenib (Fig. 5D), consistent with a
previous report that COT activates MEK and ERK in a RAF-

www.aacrjournals.org

independent manner (20). Notably, dimer formation was
observed when NRASQ61K was expressed in A375 cells (Fig.
5E). The observed BRAF–CRAF dimer may be induced by high
levels of GTP-bound NRAS, conferring insensitivity to vemurafenib in the cells (Fig. 5E) as reported previously (13–15, 17). In
addition, aberrantly spliced BRAF has emerged as a mechanism of resistance to vemurafenib (16). The hyperactive spliced
variants lack exons 2–10, including the RAS-binding domain,
but retain the kinase domain and constitutively dimerize in a
RAS-independent manner. Therefore, we expressed N-terminally truncated BRAF (DN-BRAF) that lacks exons 1–10 and
examined the effect of TAK-632. Consistent with previous
ﬁndings (16), MEK and ERK phosphorylation was increased
by DN-BRAF and vemurafenib had a little effect on them (Fig.
5F). In contrast, TAK-632 suppressed MEK and ERK phosphorylation in cells expressing DN-BRAF (Fig. 5F). Interestingly,
TAK-632 and vemurafenib strongly induced RAF heterodimer
formation in cells expressing DN-BRAF compared with that in
cells expressing wild-type BRAF (Fig. 5F), indicating that DNBRAF easily forms RAF heterodimers both in a steady state and
in the presence of RAF inhibitors. These observations indicate
that TAK-632 can suppress the MAPK pathway in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells bearing RAS mutation or BRAF
truncation.
Subsequently, we examined the effects of RAF inhibitors and
TAK-733 on cell proliferation of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells. TAK-632, TAK-733, and vemurafenib displayed
potent antiproliferative activities in parent or mock-transfected A375 cells (Table 2). We showed that cells expressing

TAK-632 SD at the indicated concentrations (10 mice per each treatment group). Day 0 indicates the beginning of treatment. Tumors were measured twice a
week. Points, mean tumor volumes; bars, SE. P values were calculated using t test ( , P < 0.001). B and C, mice bearing SK-MEL-2 xenografts were
treated once daily (QD) for 3 days with vehicle, TAK-632 SD at 60 mg/kg (60 mpk), or TAK-632 SD at 120 mg/kg (120 mpk). Tumor xenografts were obtained at
indicated time points after the ﬁnal treatment and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Individual blots with dividing lines are combined from a single
electrophoresis gel. Bars represent densitometric analysis of phospho-ERK, normalized to vehicle-treated control (mean  SD).

NRASQ61K and DN-BRAF demonstrated resistance to vemurafenib, as reported previously (16, 21), but retained sensitivity
to TAK-632 and TAK-733, albeit at higher doses than parent or
mock-transfected cells (Table 2). Consistent with these results,
Western blot analysis revealed that both TAK-632 and TAK-733
signiﬁcantly suppressed ERK phosphorylation not only in
mock-transfected cells but also in NRASQ61K and DN-BRAFexpressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Given that some
dabrafenib-resistant BRAF-mutated melanoma cells reportedly had NRAS mutation or BRAF truncation (34, 35), TAK-632
may also have the potential to show efﬁcacy in such dabrafenib-resistant melanoma cells. Further investigation will clarify
the point in the future.
Combination of TAK-632 with a MEK inhibitor enhances
antiproliferative activities in BRAF- and NRAS-mutated
melanoma cells
Given that near complete inhibition of the MAPK pathway
may be required for signiﬁcant antitumor effects in melanomas
(7), vertical combinations of agents targeting multiple steps
along the MAPK pathway can be a reasonable therapeutic
strategy. Therefore, we examined combinational effects of
TAK-632 and TAK-733 on MAPK pathway activation and cell
proliferation in melanomas. Compared with single treatment,
the combination robustly suppressed ERK phosphorylation in
A375, HMV-II, and SK-MEL-2 (Fig. 6A–C). As shown in a
previous study (36), TAK-733 induced the accumulation of
phosphorylated MEK in NRAS-mutant HMV-II and SK-MEL-2
cells but not in BRAF-mutant A375 cells (Fig. 6A–C), because
treatment with a MEK inhibitor induces the accumulation of
phosphorylated MEK by relieving the negative feedback loop
from ERK in BRAF wild-type cells (37, 38). In contrast, in BRAFmutant cells, the negative feedback mechanism is abrogated;

7050

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

therefore, the accumulation of phosphorylated MEK does not
occur (37, 38). Notably, when HMV-II and SK-MEL-2 cells were
cotreated with TAK-632 and TAK-733, the increase in MEK
phosphorylation by a MEK inhibitor was prevented by TAK-632
(Fig. 6B and C). To further examine the combination effects of
TAK-632 and TAK-733 in NRAS-mutated melanoma cells, we
investigated the expression level of several cell-cycle/translation/apoptosis markers in SK-MEL-2 cells. Western blot
analysis on the downstream markers shows the beneﬁt of the
combination over the single agents in cell cycle as measured
by cyclin D1, translation as measured by S6 phosphorylation,
and apoptosis as measured by cleaved PARP and lamin
(Fig. 6C).
Consistent with the potent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and downstream markers, TAK-632 showed a stronger inhibitory effect on cell viability when combined with
TAK-733 in HMV-II and SK-MEL-2 cells (Fig. 6D and E). The
calculated CI value at EC50 was 0.64 in HMV-II cells and 0.46
in SK-MEL-2 cells, indicating synergy between the drugs in
blocking the proliferation of NRAS-mutant melanoma cells.
The combination displayed similar synergistic effects in
other NRAS-mutant cells, HMCB and GAK cells (data not
shown). On the other hand, additive antiproliferative effects
were observed in A375 cells, indicated by a CI value of 1.1 at
the EC50 concentration (Fig. 6F). To determine whether the
combined effects preferentially occurred in these melanomas, we tested 293T and HeLa cells, both of which bear wildtype RAF and RAS. We found that the combination did not
induce potent inhibition of their proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). Collectively, our data indicate that
the combination of TAK-632 and a MEK inhibitor effectively
inhibits the proliferation of melanoma cells with BRAF or
NRAS mutation.

synergistic antiproliferative effects in NRASQ61K and DNBRAF cells (Fig. 6G and H; CI ¼ 0.30 and 0.36, respectively).
Consistent with these results, the combined treatment
robustly suppressed ERK phosphorylation in NRASQ61K and
DN-BRAF cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A; 2 hours of treatment and Fig. 6I and S8B; 24 hours of treatment). The 24hour treatment assay also revealed that the cotreatment led
to more drastic inhibition of cell-cycle progression, as indicated by decreased cyclin D1 expression in these cells (Fig. 6I
and Supplementary Fig. S8B). Given the strong inhibitory
effects of the combination of TAK-632 and TAK-733 on the
MAPK pathway and cell proliferation, reactivation of the
MAPK pathway appears to play a major role in the resistance
to vemurafenib in the models.

Discussion
NRAS is mutated in approximately 18% of melanomas and
10% of hematologic cancers (4). Our data using siRNA or the
pan-RAF inhibitor TAK-632 indicate that NRAS-mutated melanoma highly depends on the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (Fig. 1).
Given that melanoma possesses outstanding mutation rates in
components of the MAPK pathway, it is not surprising that this
pathway is particularly important for the initiation and/or
maintenance of melanoma. Although we have not examined
the dependence of hematologic cancers on RAF, further investigations will provide us with an insight into therapeutic
interventions for the cancers.
The inhibitor-induced conformational change in the activation loop of a kinase is observed in cocrystal structures of a
DFG-out (inactive conformation) type inhibitor and offers a
slower dissociation rate than a DFG-in (active conformation)
type inhibitor (39). We have shown that TAK-632 binds to
BRAF in the DFG-out state (28), whereas several BRAF inhibitors, including vemurafenib, are known to associate with
BRAF in the DFG-in state (7, 13). In fact, TAK-632 had a much
slower off-rate from RAF than BRAF inhibitors (13, 28). Consistent with these observations, it has been reported that an
investigational RAF inhibitor AZ-628 binds to BRAF in the
DFG-out state, has slow off-rate, and does not signiﬁcantly
induce RAF paradoxical activation (13, 40). Notably, our data
show that vemurafenib elevates RAF kinase activity in immu-

7052

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

noprecipitates even at high concentrations that suppress MEK
and ERK phosphorylation in cell lysates (Figs. 2A and 3A). This
discrepancy provides supporting evidence that vemurafenib
has a rapid off-rate from RAF and thereby easily dissociates
from RAF during immunoprecipitation and subsequent kinase
assays. The difference in dissociation rates between the panRAF inhibitor TAK-632 and BRAF inhibitors illustrates the
following model: TAK-632 (pan-RAF inhibitors) continuously
binds to both protomers of RAF dimers and thereby inhibits
kinase activity of the RAF dimer so that minimal RAF paradoxical activation occurs only at low concentrations. Meanwhile, BRAF inhibitors induce RAF dimerization but do not
persistently occupy both protomers, thereby robustly stimulating paradoxical RAF activation.
Notably, the RAF inhibitory activity of TAK-632 appears to
be several times higher than that of vemurafenib, as shown in
our data and existing ﬁndings from enzymatic assays and
cellular assays (Supplementary Fig. S1A; refs. 7, 15, 28). However, such moderate differences in the potencies of these
inhibitors may not be sufﬁcient to explain the remarkable
difference in the RAF dimer inhibitory activities (Fig. 3). We
show that in vitro-treated vemurafenib suppresses paradoxically activated RAF (Fig. 3B and S3B), suggesting that the
varying RAF dimer inhibitory activity may be derived from
the difference in the dissociation rate from RAF.
The model complies with a recently reported model that
RAF inhibitors mediate RAF paradoxical activation by relieving inhibitory autophosphorylation (33). Loss of glycine-rich
phosphate-binding (P)-loop phosphorylation is considered to
destabilize the inactive DFG-out conformation and allow a
shift to the active DFG-in conformation (41, 42). Consistent
with the report (33), we noted that vemurafenib did not
induce signiﬁcant paradoxical RAF activation in HMV-II
cells that bear not only NRAS mutation but also BRAF
mutation at G469, which may disrupt P-loop autoinhibition
(data not shown). As the formation of RAF dimers and
inhibition of P-loop autophosphorylation are not mutually
exclusive, these mechanisms are expected to cooperatively
induce RAF paradoxical activation.
Paradoxical RAF activation by BRAF inhibitors plays a signiﬁcant role in the development of squamous cell carcinoma
and keratoacanthoma in the clinic (8–11, 43). Several BRAF
inhibitors have paradoxically stimulated normal cell proliferation in mouse epithelial cells in vivo (13, 44). When we performed
pharmacodynamic analysis using melanoma xenograft rat models, we found that TAK-632 suppressed ERK phosphorylation in
xenograft tumors but did not induce RAF paradoxical activation
in normal skin tissues (data not shown). Our toxicologic studies
also showed no proliferative effects on skin epithelial cells in
animals (data not shown), suggesting that TAK-632 may avoid
the risk of secondary skin tumors in the clinic. However, whereas
vemurafenib did not have skin proliferative effects in preclinical
animal models (7), skin tumor incidence was observed in
patients (8, 9). Moreover, sorafenib, which is a multi-kinase
inhibitor with pan-RAF inhibitory effects (14, 45), is associated
with the emergence of skin tumors during treatment (46).
Collectively, we should cautiously consider whether TAK-632
has an effect on cutaneous cell proliferation.

Nakamura et al.

Since resistance to BRAF inhibitor treatment is associated
with reactivation of the MAPK pathway, the combination of the
BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in
patients with BRAF-mutant melanomas has been clinically
tested. Phase I and II trials showed signiﬁcant improvements in
progression-free survival of the combination group compared
with that of the monotherapy group (47). Notably, we showed
that TAK-632 exhibits highly synergistic effects with TAK-733
in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells (Fig. 6), suggesting
the potential clinical beneﬁt of the combination of pan-RAF
inhibitors and MEK inhibitors. In the abovementioned clinical
trials, the rate of skin proliferative lesions was reduced by the
combination therapy (47). Although the potential risk of TAK632 inducing skin tumors in patients remains unknown, combined therapy with MEK inhibitors would be a reasonable
strategy not only to enhance the antitumor activity but also to
possibly reduce the risk of skin tumor incidence. Given that
ampliﬁcation of the upstream oncogenic driver of the MAPK
pathway has been identiﬁed as a mechanism for MEK inhibitor
resistance in colorectal cancer cell lines, the combination of
pan-RAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors may also contribute to
overcoming the drug resistance in tumors besides melanoma
(48–50).
In this preclinical study, we demonstrated that TAK-632 has
favorable characteristics in terms of killing NRAS-mutant
melanoma and BRAF inhibitor-resistant BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. TAK-632 can prevent RAF paradoxical activation
by suppressing the kinase activity of the RAF dimer (Supplementary Fig. S9). Furthermore, our ﬁndings suggest that TAK632 has the potential to delay the emergence of drug resistance
caused by NRAS mutation and BRAF truncation. In addition,

TAK-632 potentially targets other tumors whose growth and
survival are dependent on the MAPK pathway. Further investigations will be required to identify such sensitive patient
populations.
