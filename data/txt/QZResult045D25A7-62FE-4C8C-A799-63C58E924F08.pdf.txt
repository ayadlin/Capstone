Abstract
Osteopontin (OPN) and splice variants of CD44 (CD44V) have
independently been identified as markers for tumor progression. In this study, we show that both OPN and CD44V are
frequently overexpressed in human gastric cancer and that
OPN-engaged CD44V ligation confers cells an increased
survival mediated through integrin activation. First, we show
that OPN treatment confers cells an increased resistance to
UV-induced apoptosis. The OPN-mediated antiapoptosis is
dependent on the expression of the variant exon 6 (V6)- or V7containing CD44 as shown by overexpression of individual
CD44V in gastric AZ521 cells that express no or very low level
of endogenous CD44 and by knockdown of the constitutively
expressed V6-containing CD44 isoforms in colon HT29 cells.
Although OPN also interacts with RGD integrins, OPN-RGD
sequence is dispensable for OPN-mediated antiapoptosis.
OPN-induced antiapoptosis is mainly attributed to the
engagement of CD44V isoforms and the relay of an insideout signaling via Src activity, leading to robust integrin
activation. Furthermore, OPN-elicited antiapoptosis was
observed when cells were plated on fibronectin but not on
poly-D-lysin, and preincubation of cells with anti-integrin B1
antibody to block integrin-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction or ectopic expression of the dominant-negative forms
of focal adhesion kinase to block ECM-derived signal
abolished OPN-induced survival, suggesting that OPN-elicited
antiapoptotic function is propagated from matrix transduced
by integrin. Taken together, we showed that OPN-CD44V
interaction promotes ECM-derived survival signal mediated
through integrin activation, which may play an important role
in the pathogenic development and progression of gastric
cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2089–97]

Introduction
Homeostasis in normal tissue is regulated by a balance between
proliferative activity and cell loss by apoptosis (1, 2). Attachment to
correct extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for survival and
growth of normal adhering cells, whereas cancer cells are able to
abrogate this requirement. Several growth factors and cytokines

play pivotal roles in the regulation of growth and survival of
neoplastic cells through affecting integrin-mediated adhesion to
ECM. Osteopontin (OPN), a secreted noncollagenous, sialic acidrich, phosphoprotein and also a member of the SIBLING family,
functions as both an ECM component and a cytokine signaling
through the binding to two cell adhesion molecules: integrin and
CD44 (3, 4). OPN was initially discovered as an inducible marker of
transformation of epithelial cells and later shown to be frequently
overexpressed in many human cancers (3). The findings that OPN
expression correlates with tumor progression in cancers of breast
(5), stomach (6), lung (7), prostate (8), liver (9), and colon (10) and
that OPN concentration in the plasma of patients with metastatic
disease is significantly higher than that in normal sera (11, 12)
implicate its role in the regulation of tumor cell migration and
metastasis. In fact, numerous studies in cultured cells have shown
that OPN expression renders cells more tumorigenic and/or
metastatic (8). In contrast, down-regulation of OPN expression by
antisense approach reduced cell growth in soft agar and in mice as
primary tumors or experimental metastasized foci (3).
The mechanisms by which OPN may enhance malignancy are
still unclear. In vitro studies have shown that OPN has multifunctional properties in promoting cell adhesion, cell migration,
and cell survival (3). Although many details pertaining to the exact
mechanisms remain to be elucidated, OPN functions through its
interaction with the integrin and CD44 families of cell surface
receptors. OPN contains at its NH2-terminal region the RGD
tripeptide sequence that can be bound by RGD-dependent integrins
(13). OPN also interacts with a9h1 and a4h1 integrins through a
cryptic site of sequence SVVYGLR adjacent to the RGD motif,
which is thought to be revealed on thrombin cleavage (14, 15). The
COOH-terminal fragment of OPN binds directly to CD44 variant
isoforms. CD44, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is
expressed in various isoforms with extended extracellular domains
by alternative RNA splicing. CD44 binds hyaluronate in the ECM to
maintain tissue/organ structure, promote cell aggregation, and
mediate cell movement (16). Up-regulation of one or more CD44V
has been implicated in the progression of a variety of tumors (17).
CD44V6 has been identified as a metastatic marker in lymphoma,
hepatocellular, breast, lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers
(18, 19). In gastric cancer, V6 is up-regulated and associated with
tumor progression (20). Functional studies have shown that OPN
can interact specifically with CD44 V6 or V7 (4, 21), and ligation
of CD44V by OPN promotes chemotaxis and adhesion of fibroblasts,
T cells, and bone marrow cells (22, 23).
Several signaling pathways are activated by OPN that may
contribute to tumor progression and metastatic behavior. On
binding to CD44, OPN confers interleukin-3–mediated or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor–mediated survival

advantage in murine B cells through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B pathway (24). OPNmediated ligation of integrin h3 has been shown to provide an
increased survival in rat aortic endothelial cells through activation of
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; ref. 25). Several studies have shown that
OPN acts in concert with several growth factors, including
hepatocyte growth factor (26) and epidermal growth factor (27),
to induce malignant properties. h1-containing integrins have been
shown to cooperate with CD44 variant isoforms to promote OPNmediated cell motility and chemotaxis in rat pancreatic carcinoma
cells (21). In this study, we have attempted to dissect mechanisms
that relay OPN/CD44-mediated cellular effects, particularly on
cell survival, for further understanding the OPN/CD44-mediated
signaling implicated in tumor formation and progression. Our
results showed that treatment with baculovirus-produced OPN
provides gastric cells increased ability to withstand apoptotic insults
through ECM-derived survival signals, and this survival effect was
mainly attributed to the binding of OPN to CD44V and the relay of
an inside-out signaling, leading to integrin activation.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents. The hybridomas Hermes-3 and FW11-24-1736 (anti-CD44V9) were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human CD44V6
(2F10) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies for integrin
h1 (P4C10 for blocking and B3B11 for flow cytometry), av (AV1), avh3
(LM609), avh5 (P1F6), and a5h1 (JBS5) were from Chemicon (Temecula,
CA). The mAb HUTS-21 for activated h1 integrin was from BD Biosciences
PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated and Alexa Fluor
594–conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Molecular
Probes (Eugene, OR). The synthetic peptide GRGDS was purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Preparation and purification of OPN. Recombinant OPN was
produced using the BaculoGold Expression System (BD Biosciences
PharMingen). In brief, the full-length cDNA of human OPN was amplified
by PCR from human placenta cDNA and subcloned into the DsRedencoding baculovirus transfer vector pABhRpX (a gift from Dr. Y-C. Chao,
Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan) to yield
the OPN-(His)6-encoding pABhRpOPN plasmid. On cotransfection of
pABhRpOPN with BaculoGold viral DNA into Sf9 cells, the recombinant
OPN-producing baculovirus was generated. High Five insect cells were
infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in
Express Five medium (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), culture supernatant
was collected after 3 to 4 days, and OPN was purified by Ni-NTA resin
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Constructs, cell culture, and transfection. Human gastric adenocarcinoma AZ521 and AGS, non–small cell lung cancer H1299, colorectal
cancer HT29, and human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines were from ATCC.
The CD44S cDNA was amplified by PCR from H1299 cDNA and subcloned
into pcDNA3.1( )/Myc-His vector to generate pcDNA-CD44S. Plasmids
pcDNA-CD44E, pcDNA-CD44V6-10, pcDNA-CD44V6, pcDNA-CD44V7, pcDNACD44V6-7, and pcDNA-CD44V7-10 were constructed by PCR amplification of
the specific CD44 variant exons from AGS cDNA and subcloned the PCR
fragments into pcDNA-CD44S at appropriate sites. The resultant plasmids
were sequence verified. The vectors encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK)related nonkinase (FRNK) and FAK (Y397F) were kind gifts from Dr. T-H.
Leu (Department of Pharmacology, National Chung-Kung University,
Tainan, Taiwan). Plasmid encoding Src (K297D) has been described
previously (28). Transient transfection was done using the LipofectAMINE
2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. AZ521/
Mock and AZ521/CD44 cell clones were established by transfection of
AZ521 cells with pcDNA3.1 and the respective pcDNA-CD44 plasmids by
electroporation method followed by selection of G418-resistant clones as
described (29).

RNA isolation, reverse transcription-PCR, and real-time PCR.
Gastric adenocarcinoma and matching nontumor mucosal tissues were
obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the Veterans General
Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan). Informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Tissues were snap frozen immediately following resection. Total RNA was
prepared from homogenized tissues and subjected to reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) as described (29, 30). PCR was done using primers for CD44
(sense primer, 5¶-GACGAAGACAGTCCCTGGAT-3¶; antisense primer, 5¶-CTTCTTGACTCCCATGTGAT-3¶; Genbank accession no. NM_000610) and OPN
(sense primer, 5¶-GGATCCCTCACTACCATGAG-3¶; antisense primer, 5¶-AAGCTTGACCTCAGAAGATGCACT-3¶; Genbank accession no. NM_000582),
respectively.
Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out as described (29). The
threshold cycles (C T) were recorded for all samples for both the target gene
and the reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Melt curve analysis was done for each run. Relative gene expression of the
target gene was calculated as DC T, determined by subtracting the C T of
reference gene from the C T of target gene. Differential expression of the
target gene in tumor versus nontumor mucosal samples was shown as DDC T,
determined by subtracting the DC T of tumor sample from the DC T of the
matching mucosal sample.
Knockdown by short hairpin RNA. The short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
vectors were constructed by annealing synthetic DNA oligonucleotide
primers (CD44V6 SH_S, 5¶-GATCCCCGGCAACTCCTAGTAGTACATTCAAGAAGATGTACTACTAGGAGTTGCCTTTTTA-3¶; CD44V6 SH_AS, 5¶-AGCTTAAAAAGGCAACTCCTAGTAGTACATCTCTTGAATGTACTACTAGGAGTTGCCGGG-3¶; with the sequences corresponding to nucleotides 6–24
of CD44 V6 exon italicized) followed by ligation into digested pSuper
(neo+gfp) vector driven by the polymerase III H1-RNA gene promoter. The
pSuper-CD44V6 sequence was verified by sequence analysis. After transfection of HT29 cells with pSuper-CD44V6 or pSuper control vectors, cells were
cultured in medium containing 400 Ag/mL G418 for 3 to 4 weeks, and stable
clones were selected and examined for the expression of V6-containing CD44
by Western blotting.
Flow cytometric analysis. Subconfluent AZ521/CD44V6 and HT29 cells
were treated with OPN or OPN(RGE) for 1 h at 37jC and incubated with
isotype IgG or HUTS-21, labeled by Alexa Fluor 488–congugated secondary
antibody, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis using FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences). Cells preincubated with 2 mmol/L MnCl2 were included
as a positive control. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with RGD
peptide (10 Amol/L) and/or anti-CD44V6 antibody (2F10) for 1 h at 37jC
before the incubation with OPN.
Adhesion assay. Adhesion of cells to plates coated with 20 Ag/mL OPN,
10 Ag/mL fibronectin, 2 mg/mL poly-D-lysine, or 1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS was assessed as described previously (31). In some
experiments, cells were preincubated with 5 Ag/mL of blocking antibodies
[anti-integrin av, h1 (P4C10), avh3, a5h1, or anti-CD44V6] or 10 Amol/L of
RGD peptide for 1 h at 37jC and subjected to adhesion assays. The
reference value for 100% attachment was obtained by seeding cells on plates
precoated with 20 Ag/mL fibronectin. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37jC
under tissue culture condition followed by immediate fixation, and
approximately 90% to 100% of input cells were recovered.
Apoptosis assay. After UV irradiation, cells were harvested after the
designated time, stained with propidium iodide, and subjected to flow
cytometric analysis of sub-G1 apoptotic fractions. To test the role of integrin,
cells were replated on fibronectin-coated or poly-D-lysine–coated dishes in
medium with or without added OPN for 4 h. Cells were UV irradiated and
harvested in 48 h for flow cytometric analysis. Alternatively, cells were
pretreated with blocking antibody against integrin h1 (P4C10) for 1 h at
37jC before OPN treatment.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of data was done by Student’s
t test using SigmaPlot software. Difference was considered to be statistically
significant at P < 0.05.

lead markers whose expression is altered in human gastric cancer
(Fig. 1A, left). OPN is frequently expressed at elevated levels in a
variety of human cancers, including gastric cancer. The gastric
cancer microarray data (32) in the Stanford Microarray Database
also confirmed increased expression of OPN in gastric cancer
compared with the nonneoplastic gastric mucosa (P < 0.0001,
Mann-Whitney U test; Fig. 1A, right). Figure 1B (top) shows the
real-time PCR analysis of OPN expression in primary gastric
cancer, showing that 75% (six of eight) gastric cancers displayed
increased expression of OPN. In these gastric cancer samples,
we also examined the expression of CD44, the major cell surface
receptor for OPN (Fig. 1B, bottom). The standard CD44 isoform
(CD44S ) was readily detected and expressed at similar levels in
gastric cancer and in the matching nontumorous tissues, whereas
the epithelial-specific CD44 isoform (CD44E or CD44V6-8 ) and many
larger variant isoforms, particularly the CD44V6-10 , were expressed
at elevated levels in gastric cancer compared with the nontumorous mucosa. It was noted that many of the gastric cancers

that express higher level of OPN also express increased levels of
CD44 variant isoforms.
OPN protects cells from UV-induced apoptosis dependent
on the expression of CD44 variant isoforms. To determine
whether OPN promotes tumorigenesis and progression of epithelial-derived cancers, we examined the response of colon cancer
HT29 cells and gastric cancer AZ521 cells for their response to
OPN-mediated cellular effects, particularly on cell survival. HT29
cells express high levels of endogenous CD44S and other variant
isoforms, whereas AZ521 cells display very low or undetectable
CD44 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Subconfluent cells were treated
with or without OPN and subjected to UV irradiation, and
apoptosis was followed by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in
Fig. 2A, UV irradiation induced a time-dependent increase in the
number of HT29 and AZ521 cells undergoing apoptosis. Treatment
with OPN significantly suppressed UV-induced apoptosis in HT29
but had no effect on AZ521 cells. To corroborate that OPNmediated antiapoptotic effect is mediated through CD44, AZ521

Figure 2. OPN provides cells an increased resistance to UV-induced apoptosis
dependent on CD44 variant isoform. Subconfluent HT29 and AZ521 (A),
AZ521 clones harboring control plasmid or plasmids encoding specific CD44
isoforms (B ), and HEK293 (C ) cells were cultured in serum-free medium for
24 h and incubated with or without added OPN (10 Ag/mL) for 4 h. Cells
were then UV irradiated at 90 J/m2 (for HT29 and AZ521 cells) or 130 J/m2
(for HEK293 cells) and harvested for apoptosis assay by flow cytometric
analyses of sub-G1 fractions at designated time.

cell clones stably expressing designated CD44 variant isoforms
were established and subjected to UV irradiation. As shown in
Fig. 2B, the control and all CD44-expressing cells displayed a timedependent apoptosis after UV irradiation, whereas OPN treatment
conferred a more resistant phenotype toward UV-induced apoptosis in the AZ521/CD44V6-10 cells but not others. We next
tested whether OPN provides survival advantage in nontransformed cells (Fig. 2C). HEK293 cells, which exclusively express
CD44S, are sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis, and OPN treatment
offers little survival advantage. Importantly, ectopic expression of
CD44V6-10 rendered HEK293 more resistant to UV-induced
apoptosis in the presence of OPN.
OPN-elicited cell survival is correlated to its interaction

effects, we assessed the interaction of OPN and CD44 by determining the binding of AZ521 cells expressing designated CD44
isoforms to OPN-coated plates. It has been shown that OPN binds
to CD44V6 and possibly CD44V7 isoforms and enhances the
migration of rat fibrosarcoma cells (21). To ascertain whether the
V6- or V7-encoded sequences account for the CD44 structural
prerequisite for OPN-elicited survival effect, AZ521 cell clones
expressing CD44S, CD44E, CD44V6-10, CD44V7-10, CD44V6-7, CD44V6,
and CD44V7 were established and cell binding assays were done
(Fig. 3A). As shown, cells expressing CD44 variant isoforms
containing either the V6- or V7-encoded sequences adhered to
OPN with markedly increased affinity compared with the control
cells, suggesting that the increased adherence is dependent on the
expression of CD44V. Furthermore, the increased adherence was
reversed in AZ521/CD44V6 cells when cells were pretreated with
blocking antibody against V6 (Fig. 3B). The binding of OPN to
RGD integrins also showed that it was marginally elevated in the
AZ521/Mock, AZ521/CD44S, and AZ521/CD44E cells as compared
to their binding to BSA (Fig. 3A) and that preincubation with
excess amount of RGD peptides completely abolished this binding
(Fig. 3B). These results showed that cell binding to OPN is
mediated through both CD44-dependent and CD44-independent
(integrin dependent) mechanisms. In line with the increased OPNbinding ability in cells expressing CD44 isoforms containing the
V6- or V7-encoded sequences, these cells also displayed a more
resistant phenotype to UV-induced apoptosis on OPN treatment
(Fig. 3C). The fact that OPN-elicited survival was significantly
higher in AZ521 cells that express V6- or V7-containing CD44
compared with the AZ521/Mock, AZ521/CD44S, and AZ521/CD44E
cells highlights the important role of CD44-dependent but not the
RGD-dependent interactions in this event. In line with this notion,
OPN(RGE), in which the RGD sequence was mutated to RGE,
conferred HT29 cells increased resistance to UV-induced apoptosis
as the wild-type OPN did (Fig. 3D).
To corroborate that the antiapoptotic effect of OPN is mediated
through CD44V, we studied the effect of targeted knockdown of
CD44V expression on OPN-mediated antiapoptosis. We chose to
knockdown the expression of V6-containing CD44 mRNA in HT29
cells because these cells express largely the V6-containing variant
isoforms. Knockdown was achieved by transfection of a pSuper
plasmid carrying the shRNA sequence targeted to CD44 V6 region
(pSuper-V6) and pSuper alone as a control. After selection, four
HT29shRNAV6 (carrying the shRNA for V6-containing CD44) and
two HT29shRNA (carrying the pSuper) clones were obtained and
assessed for OPN-mediated antiapoptosis. The expression of V6containing CD44 was fully eliminated in HT29shRNAV6 clones 12 and
31 and reduced by 60% in clones 22 and 27 in comparison with that
in the control HT29shRNA clones C1 and C2. Targeted knockdown of
the expression of V6-containing CD44 isoforms effectively reversed
OPN-mediated antiapoptosis in HT29 cells in correlation to the
reduced levels of V6-containing proteins (Fig. 3D).
Synergistic effect of CD44 and integrin on cell binding to
OPN. As described above, cells expressing CD44 that contain V6- or
V7-encoded sequences exerted significantly elevated adhesion to
OPN through both CD44-dependent and CD44-independent
(integrin-dependent) manners. We further assessed the contribution of CD44, integrin, or both in combination to the association
with OPN using AZ521/CD44V6 cells as a model. As shown in
Fig. 4A, CD44-mediated cell binding to OPN, as measured by
incubating cells with OPN in the presence of RGD peptides to block
integrin-dependent binding, was enhanced commensurate with the

OPN-CD44V6,7 Interaction Promotes Cell Survival

increased levels of CD44V expressed, whereas integrin-mediated
binding, which was measured in the presence of anti-CD44V6
antibody to block CD44-dependent binding, remained marginal
and unchanged. In the absence of blocking reagents, significantly,
cell binding to OPN was dramatically increased as a function of the
levels of CD44V expressed. Similarly, CD44V and integrin also work
cooperatively to promote cell adhesion to OPN when incubating
with increasing concentrations of OPN (Fig. 4B). These data
suggested that CD44V, which was shown above to play a significant
role in facilitating cell adhesion to OPN, may engage a synergistic
effect to promote integrin-mediated cell adherence to OPN. In
agreement, pretreatment of cells with blocking antibody against
RGD integrins [e.g., h1 (P4C10) and av] intercepted this effect and
limited the ability of the cell to bind OPN solely to the OPN-CD44V
interaction (Fig. 4C).
OPN-mediated CD44 ligation induces integrin activation. An
increase in ECM-integrin interaction could reflect either mobilization of more integrins to the cell surface or increased binding
affinity as well as valency of the integrins already present.
Thamilselvan and Basson (33) have reported that ECM-integrin
interaction stimulated adhesion mediated through integrin activa-

tion without changing integrin surface expression. We further
examined the process of integrin activation in OPN-mediated
survival. The activation of h1 integrin was assessed by flow
cytometric analyses using mAb (HUTS-21) specifically recognizing
the active conformer of h1 integrin. As shown, robust activation of
h1 integrin was observed in the AZ521 (Fig. 5A) and HT29 (Fig. 5B)
cells expressing CD44 isoforms containing V6 or V7 sequences. On
the other hand, low level of activated h1 integrin was detected in
the AZ521/Mock, AZ521/CD44S, and AZ521/CD44E cells (data not
shown). Therefore, our data showed that binding of OPN to CD44V
efficiently promoted integrin activation. In the absence of the
OPN-RGD sequences, OPN(RGE) exhibited similar effect to induce
integrin activation (Fig. 5B). In addition to the CD44-dependent
activation, RGD integrins are also activated on engagement by OPN
in a CD44-independent manner. Preincubation with anti-V6 antibody greatly suppressed OPN-elicited CD44-dependent activation
of integrin h1 in AZ521/CD44V6 cells to the level observed in the
AZ521/Mock cells (Fig. 5C). The observed moderate level of CD44independent integrin activation was further suppressed to basal
level by the incubation with RGD peptides (Fig. 5C). On OPN
treatment, the increased level of integrins with active conformer

Figure 4. Synergistic effect of CD44 and integrins on cell adhesion to OPN.
A, cell binding to OPN correlates to CD44V expression. AZ521 cells were
transiently transfected with increasing amounts of pcDNA-CD44V6 as indicated,
and cell attachment to OPN in the presence of RGD peptides (10 Amol/L),
anti-V6 antibody (5 Ag/mL), or a control IgG (5 Ag/mL) was determined. B, cell
binding to OPN correlates to OPN concentration. AZ521 cells were transiently
transfected with 10 Ag of pcDNA-CD44V6 and reseeded to plates precoated
with OPN (5, 10, 15, and 20 Ag/mL) in the presence of RGD peptides, anti-V6
antibody, or a control IgG in cell binding assay. C, cell binding to OPN is
suppressed by anti-integrin antibodies. Subconfluent AZ521/CD44V6 cells were
pretreated with blocking antibodies (5 Ag/mL) against integrins av, h1 (P4C10),
avh3, or a5h1 for 1 h at 37jC and replated on OPN (20 Ag/mL) or 1% BSA for
30 min, and cell adhesion was determined. Columns, mean of three independent
experiments; bars, SD. **, P < 0.01, Student’s t test.

was not due to the increased levels of integrins expressed on cell
surface, as the expression of a5, av, h1, and h3 integrins remained
unchanged in HT29 and AZ521/CD44V6 cells after incubation with
OPN for 24 h (data not shown).
In recent studies, Src kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), PI3K,
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), and ERK have been

implicated in the regulation of integrin activity (34–36). We further
examined the potential signaling pathway that may mediate CD44induced integrin activation. AZ521/CD44V6 cells were incubated
with RGD peptides to block the interaction of OPN and RGD
integrins and, in the same time, treated with PP2, a Src family
kinase inhibitor, as well as inhibitors specific to PI3K (LY294002
and wortmannin), MAPK (PD98059), PKC (GF109203X), and
NF-nB (curcumin) followed by the incubation with OPN, and our
results showed that the treatment with PP2 significantly blocked
OPN-induced integrin activation (Fig. 5D), whereas inhibitors to
PI3K, MAPK, PKC, and NF-nB had little effect (data not shown).
Furthermore, ectopic expression of a dominant-negative Src
(K297D) also blocked OPN-induced integrin activation (Fig. 5D).
These data suggested that OPN-CD44V interaction relays an insideout signaling mediated through Src activity, leading to integrin
activation. Therefore, OPN can promote integrin activation via
both inside-out (by OPN/CD44V6 association) and outside-in
(by OPN/RGD integrin association) mechanisms. The CD44Vmediated integrin activation was important to support OPNmediated survival. On the contrary, the CD44-independent integrin
activation is dispensable in this process.
OPN-mediated integrin activation promotes cell adhesion
and matrix survival signal. Signaling events controlled by
integrin regulate important biological processes, including cell
adhesion. We next investigated the effect of OPN-elicited integrin
activation on cell adhesion. As shown in Fig. 6A, OPN significantly
enhanced the adherence of HT29 and AZ521 cells that expressed
CD44 V6- or V7-containing isoforms to fibronectin. In comparison,
cell attachment to poly-D-lysine or BSA was not altered by
OPN treatment. Pretreatment of CD44V6-expressing AZ521 cells
with blocking antibody against CD44V6 significantly suppressed
OPN-elicited cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 6B). In addition to
the CD44-dependent effect, CD44-independent (RGD-dependent)
effect was also tested by preincubating cells with anti-integrin
blocking antibody on the attachment to fibronectin. As shown in
Fig. 6B, anti-integrin antibody not only neutralized the integrins
activated as the result of OPN-CD44 interaction but also blocked
the interaction between OPN and RGD integrins, as evidenced that
OPN-elicited cell adherence to fibronectin in AZ521/CD44V6 cells
was completely suppressed by the anti-h1 integrin blocking
antibody (P4C10) to the level observed in the control cells.
Many types of cells undergo apoptotic death when they are
deprived of matrix survival signals (37). Therefore, integrinmediated ECM signaling can support survival function to protect
cells under environmental stress. We next examined whether OPNelicited antiapoptotic function is propagated from matrix survival
signal transduced by integrin. As shown in Fig. 6C, OPN-mediated
survival was completely blocked by incubation of cells with anti-h1
integrin blocking antibody (P4C10), suggesting an essential role of
integrin activity. Therefore, we examined whether OPN-mediated
survival is derived from ECM by plating cells onto fibronectin
or poly-D-lysine. As shown in Fig. 6D, plating on fibronectin
supported OPN-mediated antiapoptosis in AZ521/CD44V6 cells. On
the contrary, OPN did not provide any survival advantage in cells
plated on poly-D-lysine. FAK is known to transduce integrinmediated signal derived from ECM. Here, we showed that blockage
of matrix-derived signals by transfection and expression of FRNK
completely suppressed CD44-mediated antiapoptotic response.
Similarly, transfection and expression of the dominant-negative
FAK (Y397F) also suppressed CD44-mediated antiapoptotic response in AZ521/CD44V6 cells (data not shown). Taken together,

OPN-CD44V6,7 Interaction Promotes Cell Survival

the OPN/CD44V-elicited antiapoptotic function is mediated
through integrin activation of matrix survival signal.

Discussion
In this study, we show that both OPN and its major cell surface
receptor CD44 are frequently overexpressed in human gastric cancer
and that OPN confers cells an increased survival dependent on the
expression of specific CD44 variant isoforms. The major finding of
this study is that ligation of CD44V by OPN induces an inside-out
signaling transduced through Src, leading to integrin activation,
which in turn facilitates cell adhesion and enhances matrix survival
signal. Several lines of evidence show that the OPN-elicited survival
is derived from ECM. First, OPN treatment confers cells increased
survival when cells are allowed to attach to proper ECM (e.g.,
fibronectin). Second, the introduction of a dominant-negative FAK
(including FRNK and FAK-Y397F) completely abolished OPN-elicited
survival, suggesting that FAK activation derived from integrin-ECM
interaction is crucial for this process. Finally, preincubation of cells
with anti-integrin h1 antibody to block integrin-ECM interaction

abolished OPN-mediated survival. These data show OPN as a
survival factor for cells expressing CD44V, suggesting a critical role of
OPN-CD44V interaction in the tumorigenic response.
Integrin signaling is bidirectional. To examine the signaling
pathway downstream OPN-CD44 interaction that leads to the
inside-out integrin activation, we tested the involvement of Src
kinase, PKC, PI3K, MEK, and ERK pathways. Our data showed that
PP2, a Src family kinase inhibitor, but not the inhibitors specific to
PI3K, MAPK, PKC, or NF-nB, blocked OPN-mediated survival.
Unlike MEK or PKC inhibition, Src inhibition by PP2 also
prevented pressure-stimulated adhesion. PP2 also inhibited FAK
phosphorylation at Tyr576, presumably by preventing Src from
phosphorylating FAK at this site (33). Furthermore, the binding of
hyaluronate to cells promotes Src recruitment to CD44 and
stimulates Src kinase activity, which in turn increases tyrosine
phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein cortactin (38). We
further investigated the function of Src in the OPN-induced
integrin activation. Binding of OPN to either the endogenously
(HT29 cells) or ectopically expressed CD44V isoforms (AZ521 cells)
efficiently promoted integrin activation, which was accompanied

Subconfluent AZ521/CD44V6 (A) and HT29 (B)
cells were treated with OPN or OPN(RGE) for
1 h at 37jC and incubated with isotype IgG
(black shaded area ) or antibody (HUTS-21,
5 Ag/mL) specifically recognizing the active
conformation of integrin h1 followed by labeling
with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary
antibody. Fluorescence intensity was determined
by flow cytometry. Cells preincubated with
2 mmol/L MnCl2 for 30 min at 37jC were included
to serve as a positive control. C, effects of
RGD peptide and anti-CD44V6 antibody on
OPN-induced integrin activation. AZ521/CD44V6
cells were pretreated with RGD peptide
(10 Amol/L) and/or anti-CD44V6 antibody for
1 h at 37jC before the incubation with OPN.
After incubation with antibody specifically
recognizing the active conformation of integrin
h1, fluorescence intensity was determined.
D, OPN/CD44-induced integrin activation is
mediated through Src activation. AZ521/CD44V6
cells were preincubated with RGD peptide
(10 Amol/L) and then treated with PP2 (30 Amol/L)
for 30 min at 37jC. Alternatively, cells were
transfected with a control plasmid or plasmid
encoding dominant-negative Src (K297D) and
incubated with RGD peptide (10 Amol/L). Cells
were then incubated with OPN (10 Ag/mL) for 1 h at
37jC and incubated with antibody specifically
recognizing the active conformation of integrin h1
as described above. Y axis, cell numbers that were

Figure 6. OPN/CD44V-elicited cell survival is derived
from ECM. A, OPN promotes cell adhesion to fibronectin.
Subconfluent HT29, AZ521/Mock, and AZ521/CD44V6
cells were incubated with or without OPN (10 Ag/mL) for
1 h at 37jC, replated on fibronectin (FN ), poly-D-lysine
(PDL ), or BSA, and allowed to adhere for 30 min.
B, OPN-elicited cell adhesion is suppressed by antibodies
against CD44V6 and integrins (5 Ag/mL). AZ521/CD44V6
cells were trypsinized and pretreated with blocking
antibodies as indicated for 1 h at 37jC before the
incubation with OPN. Cell adhesion to fibronectin was
determined as described in Materials and Methods.
C, anti-integrin h1 blocking antibody blocks OPN/CD44Vmediated cell survival. Subconfluent AZ521/Mock and
AZ521/CD44 clones were pretreated with or without
blocking antibody against integrin h1 (P4C10) for 1 h
at 37jC and further incubated in the same medium
supplemented with or without OPN. Cells were UV
irradiated and subjected to apoptosis assay as described
above. D, fibronectin supports OPN-mediated
antiapoptosis, which is blocked by the expression of
the dominant-negative FAK. Subconfluent AZ521/CD44V6
cells were transfected with a control plasmid or plasmid
encoding FRNK, cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h,
and replated on fibronectin or poly-D-lysine in the presence
of medium with or without OPN (10 Ag/mL) for 4 h.
The cells were then subjected to UV irradiation followed
by apoptosis assay as described above. Columns, mean

with Src recruitment to CD44 and stimulation of Src kinase activity
(data not shown). More importantly, OPN(RGE), unable to activate
Src via an integrin, exhibited similar effect to induce integrin
activation in a CD44V-dependent manner, suggesting that Src is
involved in the inside-out signaling pathway of OPN-induced
integrin activation. In agreement, the dominant-negative Src
(K297D)-transfected cells showed significantly reduced integrin
activation induced by OPN.
Our study shows that a survival signal is induced on the
ligation of CD44 by recombinant OPN at a concentration that
exceeds the normal physiologic condition. Although the effective
OPN concentrations within tumor cells or their surrounding
stroma tissues have not been determined, increased expression of
OPN is associated with tumor malignancies in several types of
cancers and OPN is being investigated as a biomarker (10, 39–41).
A 10- to 20-fold induction of OPN was observed in colon cancer
with liver metastasis (10), and for pleural mesothelioma, high
levels of pleural-fluid OPN were observed and a cutoff value of
11,436 ng/mL was suggested for early diagnosis (39). Many types

of cells undergo apoptotic death when they are deprived of
matrix survival signals (37). Therefore, integrin-mediated ECM
signaling downstream OPN-CD44 interaction can support survival
function to protect cells under environmental stress. Such
protection may not only support the transformation process
during initial tumor formation and expansion but also facilitates
metastatic dissemination. Our data hence show the important
roles of CD44 and OPN in tumor development and progression.
In line with this notion, CD44 overexpression has also been
detected and linked to poorer prognosis in many types of human
cancers.
