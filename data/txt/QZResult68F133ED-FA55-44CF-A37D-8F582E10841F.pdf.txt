Abstract
Despite the crucial roles dendritic cells (DC) play in host
immunity against cancer, the pharmacologic effects of many
chemotherapeutic agents have remained mostly unknown. We
recently developed a DC biosensor clone by engineering the
stable murine DC line XS106 to express the yellow fluorescent
protein (YFP) gene under the control of interleukin (IL)-1B
promoter. In this study, the resulting XS106 pIL1-YFP DC clone
was used to screen 54 anticancer drugs. Each drug was tested
at five concentrations (0.1–10 Mmol/L) for its effects on YFP
expression, cell viability, and granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor–dependent growth. Our unbiased systematic screening unveiled a striking heterogeneity among the
tested anticancer drugs in their effects on the three functional
variables. Interestingly, 15 drugs induced significant YFP
expression at subcytotoxic concentrations and were thus
categorized as ‘‘DC-stimulatory’’ anticancer drugs. These
drugs were subsequently found to induce at least one of the
characteristic maturational changes in mouse bone marrow–
derived DCs. For example, vinblastine, a prototypic drug of
this class, induced the production of IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-12,
increased surface expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC
class II, and augmented T cell–stimulatory capacity of DCs.
Not only do these results illustrate the differential pharmacologic effects of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents on
DCs, they may also provide a conceptual framework for
rationale-based selection and combination of anticancer
drugs for clinical application. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6978–86]

Introduction
Dendritic cells (DC) possess all functional properties required for
presenting tumor-associated antigens to effector T cells, and
thereby, protecting the host from tumor development (1). However,
tumor cells may escape from immune surveillance and even shape
their immunologic phenotype via cancer immunoediting (2, 3). For
example, cancer cells (and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes) suppress
the development/maturation of DCs by elaborating vascular
endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-h, interleukin (IL)-10, and prostaglandin E2 (3, 4). This problem may be
overcome by DC-targeted immunotherapeutic approaches, such as

adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded DCs after loading with tumor
antigens, intratumor administration of DC-attracting chemokines,
and use of DC-stimulatory adjuvants (5, 6). Tissue-resident DCs
play immunosurveillance roles in the steady state by sampling
materials and detecting aberrant signals, including microbial
products and proinflammatory mediators. Upon sensing such
pathologic signals, DCs increased the surface expression of MHC II
and costimulatory molecules, elaborate cytokines and chemokines,
heighten the ability to activate immunologically naı̈ve T cells, and
migrate to draining lymph nodes. Those DCs that have completed
these changes (termed mature DCs) are fully capable of inducing
adaptive immune responses, whereas immature DCs are involved
in immunologic tolerance (7).
Chemotherapy remains the standard treatment modality for
many advanced cancers, although it is neither curative as a standalone protocol nor effective in augmenting host immune responses
to cancer cells. Instead, most chemotherapeutic agents are likely to
impair the clonal expansion of effector lymphocytes as well as
homeostasis of innate leukocytes, thereby potentially suppressing
host immunity (8). This is not totally unexpected because classic
chemotherapeutic agents were originally discovered based on their
activities to interrupt with metabolic processes for DNA, RNA, and
protein biosynthesis. It has recently become evident that certain
chemotherapeutics augment host immunity (9). For example,
selected agents increase the immunogenicity of cancer cells
(10, 11), preferentially inhibit the function of regulatory T cells
(12, 13), or elicit macrophage activation (14). Few systematic
studies have been reported in the literature comparing diverse
anticancer agents for their effects on DCs. Thus, we sought to fill
this apparent gap of knowledge by conducting an unbiased
screening of a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents. To
achieve this time-efficiently and cost-efficiently, we used the
recently developed DC biosensor system. Based on the observation
that DC maturation is accompanied by rapid and robust IL-1h
mRNA expression (15), we engineered the murine DC line XS106 to
express the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) gene under the control
of IL-1h promoter. The resulting XS106-pIL1-YFP DC clone
exhibited strong YFP fluorescent signals upon exposure to all
tested agents known to induce DC maturation (15). Here, we report
the differential effects of 54 anticancer drugs on DC maturation,
survival, and growth.

concentration of 0.5%. Ovalbumin (OVA; Sigma) was dissolved in PBS at
100 mg/mL and then passed through the polymyxin B column (Pierce)
repeatedly until endotoxin became undetectable by the QCL-1000 system
(Cambrex Bio Science).
Classification of anticancer drugs. The DC biosensor clone was
incubated in 96-well plates (5  104 cells/200 AL/well) for 16 h with each
drug at five concentrations in triplicate and then examined for YFP
expression and propidium iodide (PI) uptake (15). The parental XS106 DC
line was cultured in 96-well plates with 0.5 ng/mL of GM-CSF in the
presence of each test drug and examined for 3H-thymidine uptake on day 2.
Regression curves were generated from the dose-response data sets for YFP
expression, growth inhibition, and cytotoxicity using the Regression Wizard
(Sigmoidal dose-response) function in the Sigma Plot program to calculate
the ‘‘minimal effective doses’’ (MED). The 54 drugs were clustered based on
the MED values for the three functional variables using the Gene Tree
function in the GeneSpring program.
Effects of type 1 drugs on DC phenotype and function. Bone marrow
(BM)–derived DC cultures were propagated as before (18, 19). After 24 h of
incubation with each test drug at 106 cells/mL, the cells were examined for
surface phenotype within the CD11c+ populations and release of cytokines
by ELISA. Following 24-h incubation with a test drug, BM-DCs were
incubated for 10 min with 5 mg/mL of FITC-conjugated dextran (FITC-DX,
70 kDa; Sigma) at 4jC or 37jC, washed extensively, and then examined for
FITC signals by CD11c+ cells. After drug pretreatment, BM-DC preparations
(derived from BALB/c mice) were washed thrice and then cocultured in
96-well round-bottomed plates with splenic T cells purified from C57BL/6
mice (5  104 cells/well). The magnitude of T cell proliferation was assessed
by 3H-thymidine uptake on day 4 (15). To test antigen cross-presentation,
vinblastine-pretreated BM-DCs (derived from C57BL/6 mice) were pulsed
with OVA protein (0.3 mg/mL) or OVA257–264 peptide (1 Ag/mL) for 1 h,
washed extensively, and added to microcultures of CD8 T cells (5  104
cells/well) freshly purified from OT-I transgenic mice. In some experiments,
BM-DCs derived from the IAh-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)
knock-in mice (20) were cocultured with vinblastine-pretreated BM-DCs
from wild-type mice. Human DC cultures derived from the CD34+ cord
blood progenitors were purchased from Mat Tek Corporation (21).
Statistical analysis. Each test drug was compared with vehicle alone
control by a two-tailed Student’s t test. All experiments were repeated at
least thrice to assess reproducibility.

Results
Differential effects of anticancer drugs on DCs. From
commonly used chemotherapeutic agents (17), we constructed a
test library consisting of 12 topoisomerase inhibitors, 5 inhibitors
of microtubule polymerization, 14 alkylating agents, 8 antimetabolites, 4 platinum agents, 4 hormonal agents, and 7 others (Supplementary Table S1). Each of the 54 drugs were added at five
different concentrations (0.1–10 Amol/L) to microcultures of the
DC biosensor clone in triplicate. After 16 hours of incubation,
we examined YFP expression as an indicator of DC maturation
(red lines, Fig. 1A). Several drugs induced significant YFP
expression in a dose-dependent manner. They included camptothecin sodium salt (CPT-Na), which was identified as a ‘‘hit’’
compound in our previous DC biosensor-based screening of a
small compound library from the National Cancer Institute (15), as
well as other topoisomerase inhibitors, such as doxorubicin (ADR),
daunorubicin (DNR), epirubicin (EPR), idarubicin (IDR), mitoxantrone (MXT), and ellipticine (ELP). YFP expression was also
triggered by antimicrotubule agents, including vinblastine (VBL),
paclitaxel (PTX), and docetaxel (DCT). Two alkylating agents,

www.aacrjournals.org

mechlorethamine (HN2) and diaziquone (AZQ), and an antimetabolite, cladribine (2-CdA), also induced YFP expression.
The same 54 drugs were also tested for their cytotoxicity by
measuring PI uptake by the DC biosensor clone (green lines, Fig. 1A).
Varying degrees of cytotoxicity were observed with all tested
topoisomerase inhibitors, except for irinotecan (CPT-11) and
etoposide (VP-16). Antimicrotubule inhibitors, VBL, PTX, vincristine
(VCR), and vinorelbine (VRL), and a retinoid, alitretinoin (9-cRA),
also induced modest reduction in cell viability. Other drugs exhibited
significant cytotoxicity in the tested concentration range.
As the third readout, we measured the effect on parental XS106
DC growth primarily to validate the biological activities of the
tested drugs (blue lines, Fig. 1A). A total of 35 drugs, including all
tested topoisomerase inhibitors and microtubule inhibitors,
inhibited GM-CSF–dependent growth of XS106 DCs in a dosedependent fashion.
Classification of anticancer drugs based on their differential
effect on DCs. Our screening results unveiled a striking diversity
among the tested anticancer drugs in their effects on maturation,
survival, and growth of the XS106 DCs. To interpret the data
systematically, we calculated the MED value for DC maturation
from each dose-dependence curve, which was defined as the
concentration required for producing 30% increase in YFP signals
above the baseline level. Likewise, we calculated the MED values
for DC killing and for DC growth arrest, defined as the
concentration causing 77% (i.e., 100/130) reductions in cell viability
and 3H-thymidine uptake, respectively. The actual MED values of
all drugs tested are described in Supplementary Table S1.
We next used the MED values as denominators to categorize the
drugs based on their relative efficiencies to induce DC maturation,
DC killing, and DC growth arrest (Fig. 1B). This approach enabled
us to classify the 54 chemotherapeutic agents into (a) type 1 drugs
(15 agents, red lines Fig. 1B) that delivered DC maturation signals
at concentrations causing only marginal DC death, (b) type 2 drugs
(19 agents, blue lines) that primarily inhibited DC growth, (c) type 3
drug (actinomycin D or AMD, purple line) that caused DC growth
arrest and DC death without delivering DC maturation signals, and
(d) type 0 drugs (19 agents, black lines) that cause no substantial
change at the tested concentrations. Anticancer drugs categorized
as type 1 were of particular interest because some of them might be
used as ‘‘immunostimulatory’’ chemotherapeutics—they included
nine topoisomerase inhibitors (CPT, CPT-Na, ADR, DNR, EPR, IDR,
VP-16, MXT, and ELP), three antimicrotubule agents (VBL, PTX,
and DCT), two alkylating agents (HN2 and AZQ), and a purine
analogue (2-CdA).
Do type 1 anticancer drugs indeed induce DC maturation?
Although the DC biosensor system provides a time-efficient and
cost-efficient assay platform, it has two major limitations. First, the
indicator we used (i.e., IL-1h promoter activation) may not fully
reflect the state of DC maturation. Second, the DC preparation we
examined (i.e., XS106 DC line) may not fully represent bona fide
DCs. In fact, the magnitude of YFP expression inducible by a given
stimulus did not correlate with its actual effect on BM-DC
preparations (15). We next sought to determine whether some of
the type 1 anticancer drugs would induce characteristic changes
known to accompany DC maturation. In this regard, we observed
previously that CPT-Na, which was identified as a hit from the
National Cancer Institute small compound library, induces
phenotypic maturation of murine BM-DCs without causing robust
cytokine production or augmenting their T cell–stimulatory
capacity (15). Thus, we tested the remaining 14 type 1 drugs in

effectiveness in elevating YFP expression by the DC biosensor clone (red lines ), to kill the same DC clone (green lines), and to inhibit GM-CSF–dependent growth
of the parental XS106 DC line (blue lines ). Points, mean from three independent experiments; bars, SD (n = 3). Note that YFP expression levels are shown in
different scales for some drugs. B, from the above dose-dependency curves, the MED values were determined for DC maturation (YFP expression), growth arrest

for clustering the drugs. Mechanisms of action for individual drugs are indicated in different colors as shown in Supplementary Table S1.

this study for their effects on BM-DCs. Each drug was tested
at a predetermined concentration, i.e., the highest MED value
for DC maturation selected from three independent screening
experiments. DNR and HN2, which were found to kill large
numbers of BM-DCs at the above defined concentrations, were
tested at arbitrarily chosen concentrations of 0.3 and 0.6 Amol/L,
respectively.
BM-DCs were cultured for 24 hours with each test drug and then
examined for surface expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC II.

A microtubule inhibitor, vinblastine, seemed to increase the
expression of all four markers of DC maturation, without affecting
cell viability measured by PI uptake (Fig. 2A). We did the
experiment with triplicate samples and scored the observed
difference as ‘‘up-regulation’’ only when a given drug induced a
statistically significant (P < 0.05) and biologically substantial
(>30%) increase in the median fluorescence intensity value above
the baseline level. Three drugs, VBL, PTX, and VP-16, fulfilled the
dual criteria for up-regulating all four of the phenotypic markers

for DC maturation (red , Fig. 3A). Other drugs that were found to
up-regulate CD40 expression (CPT, ADR, IDR, ELP, HN2, and AZQ)
failed to increase the expression of CD80, CD86, or MHC II. The
viability of BM-DCs remained mostly unchanged after 24 hours of
incubation with any drug at the tested concentration.
Supernatants collected from the above BM-DC cultures were
then examined for IL-1h, IL-6, IL-12 p40, and tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNFa; Fig. 3B). Once again, we used the same dual
criteria to define a statistically significant (P < 0.05) and biologically
substantial (>30%) change in cytokine production. Nine drugs
induced up-regulated production of IL-1h protein by BM-DCs, and
two down-regulated IL-1h production. Likewise, production of
other cytokines was up-regulated by some of the type 1 drugs.
Interestingly, mitoxantrone, which failed to induce phenotypic
maturation, up-regulated the production of all tested cytokines.
Vinblastine, which induced full phenotypic maturation, upregulated the production of IL-1h, IL-6, and IL-12, whereas
down-regulating TNFa production. These findings further illustrated the differential effects of type 1 drugs on different functional
variables of DC maturation.
The most crucial functional property of mature DCs is the ability
to activate immunologically naı̈ve T cells efficiently. Thus, we

pretreated BM-DCs with each type 1 drug and then tested their
efficiency to activate allogeneic T cells. DCs pretreated with CPT,
ELP, VBL, PTX, DCT, HN2, AZQ, or 2-CdA exhibited significantly
(P < 0.01) augmented T cell–stimulatory capacity (Fig. 2B). By
contrast, DCs pretreated with daunorubicin showed a significantly
reduced ability to activate allogeneic T cells. The remaining type 1
drugs (ADR, EPR, IDR, VP-16, and MXT) induced no detectable
changes in the T cell–stimulatory potential.
In summary, not all type 1 anticancer drugs uniformly induced a
full spectrum of maturational changes in DCs (Fig. 4). Instead, we
observed marked heterogeneity in their abilities to elevate the
surface expressions of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC II to trigger the
production of IL-1h, IL-6, IL-12, and TNFa, and to augment the T
cell–stimulatory capacity of DCs. It should be noted here that each
drug produced at least one of these characteristic changes. Most
notably, vinblastine was found to produce all the maturational
changes of DCs (except for TNFa production) in BM-DCs.
Pharmacologic effects of vinblastine on DCs. Having
identified vinblastine as a prototypic type 1 anticancer drug, we
next further characterized its effects on DCs. In dose-dependency
experiments, vinblastine ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 Amol/L induced
IL-1h, IL-6, and IL-12 p40 production and elevated CD40, CD80,

mechanisms by which vinblastine induces DC maturation, we
determined whether vinblastine-pretreated BM-DCs ( from wildtype mice) might indirectly activate secondary BM-DC preparations (derived from the IAh-EGFP knock-in mice). The EGFP/

CD11c+ DC populations showed CD86 up-regulation after coculturing with vinblastine-pretreated DCs (Fig. 5B), and the observed
CD86 expression was up-regulated further by adding vinblastine
directly to the cocultures of vinblastine-pretreated DCs and
nontreated DCs (Fig. 5C). These results suggest dual mechanisms

of vinblastine action, i.e., direct and indirect DC activation. With
regard to mechanisms for the indirect pathway, the cytokines being
released from vinblastine-pretreated DCs (Fig. 3B) may play
functional roles.

Although it is generally believed that DCs efficiently incorporate
exogenous antigens only in the immature state (22), West and
colleagues showed that BM-DCs exhibit augmented uptake of
FITC-DX following stimulation with various toll-like receptor

ligands (23). Thus, we measured FITC-DX uptake as an additional
functional variable. Control BM-DCs treated with vehicle alone
showed modest FITC-DX uptake at 37jC and minimal surface
binding at 4jC. By marked contrast, DCs treated with vinblastine
showed an augmented endocytic capacity (Fig. 6A). Quantitative
analysis revealed 10-fold improvement of FITC-DX uptake after
vinblastine treatment (Fig. 6B). Importantly, none of the other
tested type 1 drugs exhibited such striking effects, except for
paclitaxel augmenting FITC-DX incorporation modestly. These
observations implied that vinblastine might promote the crosspresentation of exogenous antigens to CD8 T cells. In fact,
vinblastine-treated BM-DCs were far more efficient than vehicletreated DCs in presenting OVA protein to CD8 T cells purified from
the OT-I T-cell receptor transgenic mice, in which a majority of
CD8 T cells recognize the OVA257–264 peptide presented in H2-Kb
(Fig. 6C). Vinblastine treatment also augmented, albeit modestly,
their ability to present OVA257–264 peptide to the same OT-I CD8
T cells.
Although beyond the scope of the present study, we tested the
effects of vinblastine on human DCs using commercially available
DC preparations derived from CD34+ progenitors in the cord blood.
Upon exposure to vinblastine at 0.3 Amol/L, human DCs (as
defined by CD1a expression in those cultures) increased the surface
expression of MHC II, CD40, CD80, and CD86, elaborated IL-6, IL-8,
RANTES, and MIP-1a, and exhibited robust uptake of FITC-DX by

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

human DCs after vinblastine treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These in vitro observations showed the potential of vinblastine
to trigger phenotypic and functional maturation of human DCs
as well.

Discussion
Our unbiased functional screen of 54 chemotherapeutic agents
has unveiled a striking diversity in their pharmacologic effects on
maturation, survival, and growth of DCs. Based on the concentrations required to affect the three functional variables, we
categorized the drugs into four classes. To our knowledge, this is
the first published study in which diverse anticancer drugs are
compared in parallel for their effects on DCs. Considering the
important roles played by DCs in initiating and regulating host
immune responses to cancer (1, 7), our screening results provide
essential information that will allow a rational selection of
chemotherapeutic agents for ultimate clinical outcome.
Suppression of host immunity is one of the major adverse effects
of chemotherapy. Contrary to this general notion, 15 anticancer
drugs were categorized as type 1 in our DC biosensor screening.
These drugs were subsequently confirmed to induce at least one of
the characteristic maturational changes in BM-DCs. Interestingly,
most of the tested topoisomerase inhibitors (9 of 12) and
antimicrotubule agents (3 of 5) were categorized as type 1, whereas

the remaining drugs in these two families were categorized as type
2. By contrast, only a few tested alkylating agents (2 of 14), an
antimetabolite, and none of the platinum agents or hormonal
agents satisfied the criteria for type 1. These observations may
suggest an intriguing correlation between the functional property
of delivering DC maturation signals and the pharmacologic
mechanisms of action among the tested chemotherapeutic
agents.
Vinblastine was regarded as the most prominent inducer of DC
maturation among the tested type 1 drugs; it increased CD40,
CD80, CD86, and MHC II expression, triggered IL-1h, IL-6, and
IL-12 p40 production, and augmented the capacity to activate
allogeneic T cells. Interestingly, vinblastine seems to induce DC
maturation both directly and indirectly. Vinblastine markedly
improved the abilities of BM-DCs to incorporate FITC-DX and to
cross-present OVA protein to CD8 T cells. Our findings may first
seem contradictory to the general notion of vinblastine as a
chemotherapeutic drug with immunosuppressive potentials. Indeed, vinblastine has been reported to inhibit mitogen-induced
lymphocyte activation (24), induction of cytotoxic T-cell activity
(25), tumoricidal potential of macrophages (26), natural killer
cell–mediated cytotoxicity (27), antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (28), humoral immune responses (29), cellular immune
protection against microbial infection (30), and host antitumor
immunity (31). However, most of those immunosuppressive
properties were observed for vinblastine at relatively high
concentrations and/or after repeated administrations. Our data
showed that vinblastine, at relatively low concentrations (0.1–
1 Amol/L), induced the phenotypic and functional maturation
of mouse and human DCs. We recently observed that local
injection of a small amount of vinblastine is sufficient to trigger
in situ maturation of skin-resident DCs and boost humoral
and cellular immune responses to a model antigen in mice.
When injected at small amounts directly into B16 melanoma,
vinblastine elicited a marked CTL activity against melanoma
targets and interrupted otherwise progressive growth of B16
melanoma (32). Thus, we suggest that vinblastine produces
opposing immunologic outcomes depending on administration
doses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
documenting the ability of vinblastine to trigger the maturation
of DCs.

Our findings with vinblastine are consistent with our previous
results—two microtubule inhibitors, colchicine and podophyllotoxin, were identified as ‘‘hits’’ by DC biosensor–based screening of
880 Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs (15). With
regard to underlying mechanisms, colchicine and podophyllotoxin
both activated the nuclear factor nB pathway in DCs. As observed
with vinblastine, they both induced the production of IL-1h, IL-6,
and IL-12, but not TNFa. Interestingly, a synthetic microtubule
inhibitor, CC-5079, was reported to suppress TNFa production by
inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 4, an essential cyclic AMP–
metabolizing enzyme known to be involved in lipopolysaccharideactivated TNFa responses (33). Vinblastine is one of the classic
Vinca alkaloids that have greatly contributed to the clinical success
of chemotherapy over the last four decades (34). At high
concentrations, these agents directly interfere with proper spindle
microtubule formation, thereby blocking cell mitosis and eventually leading to apoptosis. The Vinca alkaloids also stabilize
microtubule dynamics at low concentrations, thereby affecting
various cellular activities. Thus, we suggest that partial and
temporal disruption of intracellular microtubule networks may
be sensed by DCs as intrinsic danger signals.
In summary, we have screened a variety of chemotherapeutic
agents in the DC biosensor system, categorized them based on
their differential effects on three functional variables of DCs, and
identified several structurally unrelated drugs capable of triggering
DC maturation. Because DCs play crucial roles in regulating host
immunity against tumor, our screening results will provide
essential data sets for rational selection and combination of
anticancer drugs for the treatment of patients with cancer.
