Abstract

Author Manuscript

Measles (MV) is an aerosol-transmitted virus that affects more than 10 million children each year
and accounts for approximately 120,000 deaths1,2. While it was long believed to replicate in the
respiratory epithelium before disseminating, it was recently shown to initially infect macrophages
and dendritic cells of the airways using the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM,
CD150) as receptor3-6. These cells then cross the respiratory epithelium and ferry the infection to
lymphatic organs where MV replicates vigorously7. How and where the virus crosses back into the
airways has remained unknown. Based on functional analyses of surface proteins preferentially
expressed on virus-permissive epithelial cell lines, we identified nectin-48 (poliovirus-receptorlike-4) as a candidate host exit receptor. This adherens junction protein of the immunoglobulin
superfamily interacts with the viral attachment protein with high affinity through its membranedistal domain. Nectin-4 sustains MV entry and non-cytopathic lateral spread in well-differentiated
primary human airway epithelial sheets infected basolaterally. It is down-regulated in infected
epithelial cells, including those of macaque tracheas. While other viruses use receptors to enter
hosts or transit through their epithelial barriers, we suggest that MV targets nectin-4 to emerge in
the airways. Nectin-4 is a cellular marker of several types of cancer9-11, which has implications for
ongoing MV-based clinical trials of oncolysis12.

Analysis of the spread of a wild type MV expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in
human airway well-differentiated epithelial sheets revealed that MV infects only columnar
cells connected by the apical adhesion complex13. Thus we thought that MV might target an
intercellular junctional protein to enter the airway epithelium. To narrow the search for this
receptor, we initially compared genome-wide transcription in permissive (H358 and H441)
and non-permissive (H23 and H522) airway epithelium cell lines13. For these cells high
quality genome-wide microarray analyses are available (GEO microarray data GSE8332)14.
We identified 175 transmembrane proteins preferentially expressed in permissive cells.
Among these, we expressed cDNAs of 22 that either had top preferential expression ratios,
or interesting biological characteristics. None of these proteins, including four claudins from
the tight junction, and E-cadherin and nectin-3 from the adherens junction (Supplementary
Table 1, footnote), conferred susceptibility to MV infection.

Author Manuscript

Next we performed a genome-wide expression analysis based on mRNA extracted from all
seven epithelial cell lines from human airways or bladder previously characterized as
permissive (3 lines) or not (4 lines)13. This time, we observed significant enrichment of 222
mRNAs for surface-associated proteins (GEO microarray data GSE32155). We selected 16
genes with high expression ratios in both screens, interesting biological characteristics, or
both. In addition, we selected the genes with the top 12 expression ratios not already
represented in the first analysis (for details see Supplementary Table 1). Non-permissive
Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with expression plasmids and subsequently
infected with GFP-expressing MV.

Author Manuscript

In one instance, we observed GFP expression followed by syncytia formation (Figure 1a,
central panel). The plasmid transfected in these cells coded for adherens junction protein
PVRL4/nectin-4. The corresponding mRNA had the 9th highest preferential expression ratio
in the second screen (Supplementary Table 1, #9). Nectin-4 is a single pass type I
transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily8,15. Its long (3.7 kb) mRNA was
initially detected only in human trachea among somatic tissues8, but a recent study
documented expression in skin, lung, prostate, and stomach16.

Author Manuscript

We assessed the levels of nectin-4 protein expression in the seven epithelial cell lines used
for gene expression profiling. FACS analyses with specific antibodies confirmed high levels
of expression in the three cell lines permissive for MV infection (Figure 1b, top row). Three
of the non-permissive cell lines did not express nectin-4, while the fourth showed variable
expression levels (Figure 1b, bottom row). We also purchased four nectin-4 specific
siRNAs, and assessed whether transfection of H358 cells with these affects MV entry.
Indeed, three siRNAs strongly reduced infection, and in particular siRNA 4_1 almost
completely abolished it (Figure 1c, right panel). We then documented that nectin-4 is
functionally equivalent to the proposed epithelial receptor EpR13 through cell fusion assays
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We also showed that neither the other three human nectins nor the
related poliovirus receptor PVR/CD15517 have MV receptor function (Supplementary Fig.
2). Remarkably, alpha-herpesviruses use ubiquitous nectin-1 as receptor, and the same is
true for nectin-218. While this paper was in review, another group documented in cancer
cells that nectin-4 is an epithelial cell receptor for MV19.

All four nectins share the same overall structure defined by three extracellular
immunoglobulin-like domains (V and two C2-type domains, VCC), a single transmembrane
helix, and an intracellular domain. To map the domain interacting with MV H, we took
advantage of two recombinant soluble forms of nectin-4: VCC-Fc and the shorter V-Fc15,
which were used to block MV infection. As shown in Figure 2a, both forms were similarly
effective: 1 μg/ml solutions sufficed for about 50% reduction of syncytia formation.
An independent mapping approach relied on two nectin-4 specific antibodies, N4.40 and
N4.61. While N4.40 recognizes one of the two C domains, N4.61 recognizes the V
domain15. Again, different dilutions of either antibody were added before virus inoculation.
Figure 2b shows that while a 0.5 μg/ml N4.61 solution inhibited entry almost completely,
100 times more concentrated N4.40 did not inhibit virus entry. Thus the soluble nectin-4 V
domain and anti-V antibodies block infection.

Author Manuscript

To further characterize the interactions of soluble H and purified virus particles with
nectin-4 and SLAM, we separated the same amount of soluble forms of both receptors by
non-reducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred them to membranes.
Figure 2c documents that binding of H to partially denatured nectin-4 (2nd and 3rd lanes) is
at least as strong as binding to partially denatured SLAM (1st lane). Figure 2d documents
stronger binding of virus (left panel) and of soluble H protein (top right panel) to VCC-Fc
than to V-Fc nectin-4 (left panel).

Author Manuscript

We then sought to determine the kinetic parameters of binding native nectin-4 (VCC-Fc) to
native H. The soluble complete extracellular domain of SLAM was used as control (Figure
2e). The measured dissociation constant (Kd) of SLAM was 93.5 nM, which compares well
with 80 nM measured previously20. The Kd of H and nectin-4 was 20 nM: while the koff of
both reactions was similar, the kon of nectin-4 and H was almost 5 times faster than that of
SLAM and H (Figure 2f). Since the Kd of the CD46 and vaccine H interaction is about 79
nM20, nectin-4 is the cellular protein bound by H with strongest affinity. However, when
CHO cells stably expressing either SLAM or nectin-4 were infected, we documented about
5 times more efficient MV infection in the SLAM-expressing CHO cells (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Thus parameters other than the Kd, like accessibility of the receptor-binding region,
influence virus spread in this system.

Author Manuscript

To assess the relevance of nectin-4 expression for MV infection in humans, we relied on
primary human airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface21. These cellular
sheets closely resemble the human airway: cells develop apical adhesion complexes with
tight and adherens junctions, and a well-differentiated morphology consisting of a
pseudostratified, ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet and basal cells. In these epithelia,
we confirmed nectin-4 mRNA expression (Figure 3a) at levels slightly higher than those of
the Calu3 cell line, which supports efficient MV infection22. We next transfected the
epithelia with specific siRNAs, achieving 90% decrease in nectin-4 mRNA (Figure 3b). We
then infected the cultures and counted on average 4 infectious centers in the negative control
siRNA-treated cells while no infectious center, or infected cell, was detected in nectin-4
siRNA treated cells (Figure 3c). Thus MV infection depends on the presence of nectin-4.

A second assay of nectin-4 function in well-differentiated human airway epithelia relied on
MV-nectin4blind (originally named MV-EpRblind), a virus with two amino acid mutations in
its H protein disallowing cell entry through the epithelial receptor13. Supplementary Fig. 4
documents that while MV infectious centers included more than 100 cells, the rare MVnectin4blind infections were limited to 1-2 cells. Thus MV must recognize nectin-4 to enter
human airway epithelial sheets, and to efficiently spread laterally.

Author Manuscript

The fact that nectin-4 is transcribed at the highest level in the trachea8 prompted us to
consider a mechanism targeting virus emergence to the tracheobronchial airways. To
analyze whether MV replicates in nectin-4 expressing cells in an infected host, we
inoculated cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) that can develop the clinical signs of
measles23. To facilitate detection of infectious centers, a GFP-expressing virus was used.
Tissues were collected near the peak of acute disease 12 days post-inoculation, and analyses
of tracheal sections revealed the expected pathological pattern (Supplementary Fig. 5,
panels a-d).
Figure 4 is a correlative analysis of nectin-4 expression and MV replication in epithelia:
strongly nectin-4 positive cells were located directly adjacent to infectious centers. These
centers consistently included many DAPI (blue) counterstained nuclei, and always lined the
tracheal lumen (Figure 4, two overlay panels at right; see also paraffin sections in
Supplementary Fig. 5, panels e-g). Remarkably, within infected cells nectin-4 was
sometimes expressed at low levels, suggesting virus-induced downregulation. Indeed
Supplementary Fig. 6 documented that median nectin-4 cell surface expression in infected
lung and bladder epithelial cell lines is about 5 times lower than in uninfected cells.

Author Manuscript

Having considered that in cells where nectin-4 is not expressed MV replication cannot
occur, we assessed the levels of viral nucleocapsid and nectin-4 mRNA in the trachea and
lung tissues of the five infected animals by real-time PCR. Supplementary Fig. 7
documents a high correlation coefficient (r=0.77) between viral and nectin-4 mRNA levels.
Moreover, it indicates high nectin-4 expression levels in the trachea and lungs, suggesting
that nectin-4 distribution in the airways of cynomolgus macaques is similar to humans.

Author Manuscript

MV begins its circuit through selected organs of the human body within SLAM-expressing
alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, which ferry it through the epithelial barrier3,4
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Analyses in primate models indicate that vigorous MV replication
occur in primary and secondary lymphatic organs, including tracheobronchial lymph nodes,
already 3-5 days after infection4. A few days’ later, most infected cells in the trachea are of
lymphoid or myeloid origin, and located in the sub-epithelial cell layer24. We collected here
tissues at the peak of acute disease, and documented large infectious centers in nectin-4
expressing epithelial cells adjacent to the tracheal lumen. We also observed good correlation
between MV and nectin-4 mRNA levels in different parts of the lungs. These data and the
experimental demonstration that a virus unable to recognize nectin-4 cannot cross the airway
epithelium and is not shed13, are consistent with targeting of a protein expressed in the
trachea for site-directed host exit. Emergence into the tracheobronchial airways appears
ideal for aerosol droplet release through coughing and sneezing, filling the air with virus

particles ready to infect the next host, and accounting for the extraordinary high
reproductive rate of MV in naïve populations25.

Nectin-4 is highly expressed in lung, breast and ovarian cancer, for which it is used as a
marker9-11. MV replicates preferentially in cancer cells26, and spontaneous regressions of
different forms of lymphoma were repeatedly observed after natural MV infections. These
oncolytic effects are attributed to SLAM-overexpression in transformed lymphocytes6. On
the other hand, a vaccine-lineage MV, which recognizes ubiquitous CD46 in addition to
SLAM as receptor, is currently used in ovarian cancer clinical trials12. Since most ovarian
cancers are of epithelial origin, nectin-4 expression is worth testing as a retrospective
correlate of MV oncolytic activity. In addition, MV-based clinical trials of lung and breast
cancer should be considered. Interestingly, most viruses in oncolysis clinical trials26 exploit
junction proteins as receptors27. It is conceivable that general accessibility of junction
proteins in disordered cancer tissue facilitates viral entry, contributing to efficient oncolysis.

RNA profiling

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Data from the first round of profiling were analyzed by the Department of Biomedical
Informatics at Mayo Clinic. After data normalization and determination of the sensitivity of
the array, 21,163 probe sets were compared for transcript expression (average permissive/
average non permissive). The data were further filtered for membrane-associated proteins,
resulting in a list of 1,531 probe sets. A total of 254 probe sets, representing 175 proteins,
were overexpressed at least 5 times in the cells permissive to wild type MV compared to
non-permissive cells. Of these 22 were expressed; the complete list of these proteins is
presented in a footnote of Supplementary Table 1. This Table also presents the data from
the second round of profiling. Here, quality-verified RNA of all previously characterized 7
epithelial cell lines13 were prepared in triplicates and analyzed with Agilent's Microarray
Scanner System based on the one-color Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing protocol
(Agilent Technologies, Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Detected signals of
probe sets (41,000) were normalized and signal intensities were compared for transcript
expression (median permissive versus median non-permissive) resulting in 2,952 upregulated probe sets in permissive cells. These were further filtered for membraneassociated proteins (259 probe sets), representing 222 up-regulated proteins. The table
presents a selection of these 222 proteins sorted for the median distance (last row) of
permissive versus non-permissive cells’ signal intensities, expressed as log2 values. The
respective factor of mRNA overexpression in permissive cells, i.e. the total signal intensity
differences, can be deduced by calculating factor 2 to the power of the median distance.
Microarray data are available in the GEO database with the accession number GSE32155.

Gene expression knock-down

Author Manuscript

The most effective siRNAs directed against nectin-4 mRNA was Hs_PVRL4_1 (target
sequence CAGAGCAGTATTAATGATGCA; FlexiTube GeneSolution for PVRL4). This
siRNA as well as negative (AllStars Negative Control siRNA) and positive control (AllStars
Hs Cell Death siRNA) siRNA duplexes were purchased from QIAgen (Hilden, Germany).
siRNA was transfected into H358 cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent
(Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4.5×103
cells were reversely transfected in 96-well plates using 3 pmol of the respective siRNA with
0.15 μl transfection reagent in a total volume of 90 μl. Transfected cells were cultured for 48
hrs before infection or analysis. Unspecific side effects of the siRNAs were assessed in the
CD46-expressing H358 cells with a CD46-recognizing MV, which entry was not affected.

FACS analysis
Cells (5×105) were detached with PBS-EDTA (2 mM) and washed three times with cold
phosphate buffered saline, incubated (1 hour) with 1 μg/ml PVRL4 mouse anti-human
monoclonal (amino acid 27-351) antibody (LS-C37483; Lifespan Biosciences, Seattle, WA,

control antibody (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) in FACS-wash buffer (PBS + 2%
FCS + 0.1% NaN3). Cells were washed three times with FACS-wash buffer and incubated
for one hour with PE-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (BD Bioscience)
diluted 1:50 in FACS-wash buffer. After washing cells three times with FACS-wash buffer,
cells were fixed with PBS + 2% PFA and subsequently analyzed on a LSRII-SORP FACS
analyzer and Diva software (BD Bioscience).

Fusion assays

Author Manuscript

Cells seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates were allowed to reach 80% confluence prior to
transfection. Equal amounts (1 μg) of pCG-IC323-F, the mutated pCGIC323-H, and EGFPexpressing pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences) were transfected in presence or absence of 1 μg
pcDNA3.1-PVRL4 using FuGENE HD (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Twenty-four to 48 hours post transfection, the formation of syncytia was observed under a
fluorescence microscope.

Inhibition of syncytia formation
MV-induced syncytia were counted on 2×104 H358 cells/well in a 96-well dish. The day
after seeding, cells were washed and medium added with different concentrations of the
N4.40 or N4.61 antibodies, or different concentrations of the soluble N4VCC or N4V; 100
TCID50/ml per well of a recombinant MVwt323-GFP(N) were added simultaneously. Two
days after infection, syncytia formation was observed under a fluorescence microscope and
the number of syncytia per well was counted.

Overlay binding assays
In the glycoprotein overlay binding assay, 0.1 μg of recombinant SLAM, N4VCC or N4V
were separated on 8% non-reducing SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a PVDF membrane and
blocking overnight, membranes were incubated for 45 min with a soluble H ectodomain (sH,
amino acids 60-617)20. In the virus overlay protein binding assay, 0.1 μg of recombinant
SLAM, N4VCC or N4V were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a PVDF
membrane and blocking overnight, membranes were incubated for 45 min with 5×104
TCID50 of a recombinant MVwt323-GFP(N). After washing, the membranes were revealed
using primary antibodies against H and corresponding secondary antibodies.

BIAcore
Author Manuscript

Soluble H ectodomain (amino acids 60-617) and soluble SLAM (amino acids 21–230, the
complete ectodomain) were expressed and purified as described20. Soluble nectin-4
ectodomain fused to human IgG1 Fc domain was expressed and purified as described8. The
interaction of the sH-protein with sSLAM and nectin-4-Fc was monitored by surface
plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 3000 instrument and CM5 sensor chips (GE
Healthcare) and the data analyzed using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software as described20.

Establishment, transfection and infection, of polarized human airway
epithelial cells

Author Manuscript

Primary cultures of human airway epithelia were prepared from trachea and bronchi by
enzymatic dispersion and seeded onto collagen-coated, semipermeable membranes with an
0.4-μm pore size (Millicell-HA; surface area, 0.6 cm2; Millipore Corporation) as previously
described21. Only well-differentiated cultures (>2 weeks old; resistance, >500 Ohms/cm2)
were used. Transepithelial resistance was measured with a volt-ohm meter (World Precision
Instruments). Values were corrected for the blank filter resistance and further standardized
against baseline readings and uninfected cultures. Neither corrected nor raw numbers
resulted in a statistically significant variation from measurements in uninfected epithelia as
determined by ANOVA. For transfections, Costar transwell permeable supports (3470 clear)
were coated overnight with collagen and washed the following day with PBS (1% PenicillinStreptomycin). 200,000 freshly dissociated human tracheal epithelial cells were transfected
in each transwell using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX with 100 nM dsRNA oligonucleotides:
5'-GCAGUAUUAAUGAUGCAGAGGUUGG-3' and 5'CCAACCUCUGCAUCAUUAAUACUGCUC-3'. Apical media was aspirated 6 hrs posttransfection and Ultroser G (Pall corporation) media was added to the basolateral surface.
For infections, MV preparations were diluted in sterile PBS to a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 0.1 (as determined on Vero-SLAM cells), and 100 μl of the solution was applied to
the basolateral surface. We did note that human airways polarized, well-differentiated cells
have a much lower susceptibility to MV infection than Vero-SLAM cells. This was expected
since these transformed cells have reduced innate immunity, including the absence of
interferon responses, and their barriers to infection are reduced compared to a differentiated
epithelium.

Primate infection and histology

Author Manuscript

Five adult female cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) were infected intranasally with
105 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of wild type MV expressing GFP and
euthanized after 12 days. The institutional animal care and use committee of the INRSInstitut Armand-Frappier (#1007-07) approved all experiments. Tissue samples were
harvested and either immediately frozen at -80°C or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma)
for at least 48 hrs. Fixed trachea samples were either paraffin-embedded cut in 5 μm sections
and used for hematoxylin and eosin staining or immunostained using a monoclonal antibody
against MV nucleoprotein (MAB8906, Millipore), a monoclonal antibody against nectin-4
(MAB2659, R&D) or a universal negative control for mouse IgG (N1698, Dako) and
counterstained with hematoxylin, or OCT-embedded, cut in 8 μm sections using a cryostat,
and counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

Figure 1. Identification of nectin-4 as candidate MV receptor

Author Manuscript

a, Nectin-4 mediates MV entry. CHO-K1 cells were not transfected (mock), or transfected
with the expression plasmids nectin-4 or MST1R. Top row: after transfection cells were
infected with a MV expressing GFP. Bottom row: expression of nectin-4 and MST1R
(interrupted black lines), as documented by FACS analysis. Dark grey lines: isotype
controls; light grey shadings: unstained controls. b, FACS analysis of nectin-4 expression
levels in different cells. Cell lines H358, H441 and HT1376, top row, are permissive for MV
infection. Cell lines H23, H522, T24, and SCaBER are non-permissive. Antibody LSC37483 was used. c, siRNA-mediated knock-down of nectin-4 expression in H358 cells (left
panels). Control (top row) or nectin-4 specific 4_1 siRNA (bottom row) were transfected.
After transfections cells were infected with a MV expressing GFP. FACS analysis (right
panels) indicated more than 90% reduction of nectin-4 expression on the cell surface.

Figure 2. V domain of nectin-4 supports strong binding to MV H

a and b, MV infection competition assays in H358 cells. For (a), N4VCC-Fc (grey bars)
with all three immunoglobulin domains, and N4V-Fc (black bars) with only the V domain
were used. As control soluble immunoglobulin superfamily protein CTLA4-Fc (cytotoxic T
lymphocyte antigen 4, also named CD152) was used (white bars). For (b), antibodies N4.40,
recognizing one of the C domains, or N4.61 recognizing the V domain, were used. All
assays were done in triplicate (n=3); mean and standard deviation of the number of observed
syncytia per well are indicated on the vertical axis. Concentration of the undiluted protein
solution is indicated on the horizontal axis. For dimeric N4VCC-Fc 10 μg/ml are 71 nM; no,
no protein added. c and d, non-reducing gel electrophoresis analysis of binding of soluble H
and purified virus particles to different soluble receptors. Molecular weight markers are
indicated. N4VCC-Fc and N4V-Fc are dimeric proteins of 140 kDa and 90 kDa
respectively8. The 260 kDa observed for N4VCC-Fc probably corresponds to association of
two dimers through C domain dependent homophilic interactions. For (d), CTLA4-Fc
loaded at the same concentration did not cross-react with soluble H (right top panel), but
was detected by protein A-HRP with the same efficiency (right bottom panel). e, surface
plasmon resonance analyses of H binding to SLAM. Multiple cycles of association and
dissociation were performed using receptor concentrations ranging from 50 to 800 nM

Figure 3. Nectin-4 is necessary for MV infection of well-differentiated human airway epithelia

Author Manuscript

a, nectin-4 mRNA expression assessed by quantitative RT PCR and presented as fold
change relative to Calu-3 cells. For human airway epithelial cells (hAEC), the bar represents
data from 6 different donor samples (n=6). For cell lines (Calu-3, HEK293, Huh7) each bar
represents 3 separate RNA preparations (n=3). b, knockdown of nectin-4 mRNA in hAEC.
Levels of nectin-4 mRNA were assessed 72 hours after transfection of a control siRNA (left
column) or a nectin-4 specific siRNA (right column) (n=6). c, lack of MV infection in hAEC
after nectin-4 mRNA knockdown. GFP-positive infectious centers were counted 3 days
following MV infection of hAEC transfected with a negative control siRNA (left column) or
nectin-4 siRNA (n=9, nine epithelial preparations from a single donor lung). All data are
expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. We note that if the well with 17 infectious centers
is excluded, p improves to 0.0055. However, the infectious center average drops to 2.75 in
the non-treated control.
