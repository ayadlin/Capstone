ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide. The inability of chemotherapeutic drugs to selectively target HCC
tumor cells because of their predominant resistant phenotype to most conventional
anticancer agents bestows a major obstacle for the clinical management of HCC. In
this report, we have examined and demonstrated the remarkable heterogeneity of
expression of survivin and its phosphorylated active form (p-survivin) in HCC patients’
tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the expression of survivin and p-survivin in HCC
cell lines was found to be associated with response to the small-molecule survivin
suppressant YM155. Therefore, in the HCC cell lines that express elevated level of
survivin and p-survivin, YM155 efficiently inhibited their proliferation, induced cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis resulting in DNA damage through the dysregulation of cellcycle checkpoint-related regulatory genes. Importantly, YM155 yielded significantly
better therapeutic effect than sorafenib when tested in an orthotopic mouse model
using patient-derived HCC xenografts with elevated survivin and p-survivin expression.
Our results clearly demonstrated that the level of survivin and p-survivin expression
could serve as molecular predictive biomarkers to select potential YM155-responsive
patients, in a move towards delivering precision medicine for HCC patients.

INTRODUCTION

of advanced HCC. Although data from the Sorafenib
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomised
Protocol (SHARP) trial [6] and the Asia-Pacific study
[7] could demonstrate a significant survival benefit, the
absolute gain in life expectancy was marginal (10.7 versus
7.9 months with placebo). Despite many ongoing efforts
to explore non-surgical strategies to treat HCC, they have
not been very successful and over 80% of the phase 3
molecularly-related targeted trials have failed [8]. Hence,
systemic chemotherapy for advanced HCC remains an
urgent unmet medical need. One possible reason was the

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1].
Unfortunately, most HCCs are still being diagnosed
at their late stages due to the lack of efficient early
detection and surveillance strategies [2, 3]. Despite novel
molecularly targeted therapies [4] and immunotherapy [5]
are being developed, they are not very effective against
advanced HCC. Currently, sorafenib is the only FDAapproved molecular inhibitor for the systemic therapy

lack of companion biomarkers that can identify patient
subpopulations that are potentially responsive to the
treatment in many of these studies [9]. Recent advances
in oncology to identify inter-patient heterogeneity enable
the stratification of patients for targeted treatments [10].
Although the cause of genetic heterogeneity in cancer has
not been well-established, there is the strategy approach
to identify prognostic biomarkers and to decipher the
associated molecular mechanisms to facilitate the selection
of patients for molecularly-targeted therapies [11].
Survivin (BIRC5) is a member of the inhibitor-ofapoptosis proteins (IAPs) family that is overexpressed
in most of human tumors but not in normal tissues [12].
YM155, a survivin suppressant, has been tested as a single
agent to treat patients with melanoma, lymphoma, lung
and prostate cancer [12]. In several phase I/II clinical
trials, YM155 has been shown to be well tolerated,
but unfortunately, its clinical efficacy has been insofar
only moderate [13]. One possible reason may be the
lack of information on the molecular heterogeneity of
the tumors being treated and consequently, making it
difficult to interpret the overall biological response.
Over-expression of survivin in HCC has been reported
to correlate with poor prognosis [14]. In this study, we
hypothesized that targeting survivin could be a treatment
strategy for HCC and subsequently demonstrated the
remarkable heterogeneity of expression of survivin and its
phosphorylated active form (p-survivin) in HCC patients’
tissues and cell lines. High survivin and p-survivin
expression in HCC cells associated with increased
therapeutic response to YM155.

and the clinicopathological parameters of the HCC
samples studied was shown in the supplementary Table
S1. The heterogeneous expression of survivin in HCC
clinical samples was also observed in the published dataset
of Roessler et al [17] (Fig. S1A).
The heterogeneous expression of survivin was
further validated in 40 pairs of HCC samples by real
time RT-qPCR analysis (Fig. 1C) and an additional
independent cohort of 30 pairs of HCC samples by
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig. 1D, 1E and Fig. S1B).
The heterogeneous expression of survivin studied by IHC
was quantitated in cells with positive nuclei staining. There
were 24 out of 30 (80%) of HCC samples that yielded an
elevated expression of survivin. Among these, 18 out of 30
(60%) gave a 2-fold increase in survivin expression while
10 out of 30 (33.33%) gave a 5-fold increase in survivin
expression (Fig. 1D and 1E).

The expression of survivin and its phosphorylated
active form (p-survivin) in HCC cell lines
correlated with their sensitivity to the survivin
suppressant YM155
The observation that survivin expressed in human
cancer cells but is absent from most normal adult tissues
makes it a promising therapeutic target for cancer
chemotherapy. The phosphorylation of survivin at
Thr34 is required for its role in regulating the cell cycle.
We therefore examined the expression of survivin and
p-survivin in a panel of HCC tissues (Fig. 2A) and cell
lines (Fig. 2B) by western blotting. Consistent with the
microarray data, survivin expression was heterogeneous.
We also observed the expression of survivin and
p-survivin was high in the cell lines Hep3B, HLE and
Mahlavu compared to HepG2 and HuH7 cells (Fig. 2B).
However, there are no correlation among the liver cancer
cells with different levels of survivin and cell growth
rates, invasiveness, and EMT markers (Vimentin and
E-cadherin) expression (Fig. S2).
Next, we compared the chemosensitivity of
these HCC cells to YM155, a survivin inhibitor. It was
observed that HCC cells exhibited different sensitivity to
YM155 (Fig. 3A). The observed concentration for 50% of
maximal effect (EC50) of YM155 for the high survivinexpressing cells such as Mahlavu and HLE was <10ng/
ml. In comparison, the observed EC50 of YM155 for the
low survivin-expressing cell lines HuH7 and HepG2 was
>1000ng/ml after incubating for either 24h or 48h (Fig.
3A (i) and (ii), respectively). In contrast, sorafenib gave
indiscriminately an overall EC50 >1000ng/ml for most
of the HCC cells tested (Fig. 3B (i) and (ii)). It appeared
likely that the sensitivity of HCC cells to YM155 could
be associated with their respective level of survivin and
p-survivin expression: high survivin-expressing cells such
as Mahlavu and HLE are more sensitive to YM155 than

The remarkable heterogeneous
expression in HCC clinical samples

survivin

The expression of survivin is quiescent in most
normal, terminally differentiated tissues but it is widely
expressed in cancers, including HCC. Previously, we
have established a global gene expression database on
human HCC tumour samples and adjacent histologically
normal liver tissues using Affymetrix Human Genome
U133 plus 2.0 Arrays [15, 16]. To evaluate the potential
role of survivin as a therapeutic target for HCC, we
systematically examined the expression of survivin in
our dataset. The expression of survivin was found to be
remarkably heterogeneous in HCC clinical samples, the
detected signal intensity ranged from log22 to log29 (Fig.
1A). Furthermore, when survival analysis was performed
using the median expression values of survivin, elevated
survivin expression in HCC tissues was significantly
associated with shorter disease-free survival, p=0.0174
(Fig. 1B). The relationship between survivin expression

blotting: 10ng/ml and 1ng/ml of YM155 significantly
inhibited the expression of survivin in the Mahlavu cells
after incubating for either 24h or 48h (Fig. 3C and 3D
respectively).

validated by qRT-PCR (Fig. S4A) and silencing survivin
decreased the sensitivity of Mahlavu cells to YM155
(Fig. S4B). Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially
expressed genes identified showed that multiple cell-cycle,
apoptotic and DNA-damage pathways were modulated
(Fig. S4C and S4D) and these included the checkpoint
regulatory-related genes CCNB1, CKS2, WEE1, API5 and
GADD45A (Fig. S3E).

YM155 inhibits the anchorage-independent cell
growth, induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and
DNA damage of high survivin-expressing sensitive
HCC cells

YM155 is a promising anti-cancer agent for HCC
cells with high survivin expression
We have stably transfected the pGL3 luciferase
reporter vector into the Mahlavu and HuH7 cells. Nude
mice orthotopically implanted with luciferase-expressing
Mahlavu and HuH7 cells were treated either with
YM155, sorafenib or saline for a total of 7 weeks. YM155
markedly suppressed the growth of the Mahlavu cells and
the observed therapeutic effect, under these conditions,
was statistically better than sorafenib (Fig. 5A and 5B). In
comparison, the observed therapeutic effect of YM155 on
HuH7, low surviving-expressing cells, was insignificant
(Fig. 5C and 5D). TUNEL staining also confirmed that
treatment with YM155 significantly increased apoptosis in
tumors derived from the Mahlavu cells (Fig. 5E and 5F).
Previously, we have established several patientderived HCC tumor xenograft lines [18]. One of these
xenografts, tentatively designated as P3, expressed
elevated level of survivin and p-survivin (Fig. 6A). P3
cells were employed in the orthotopic liver tumor mouse
model for evaluating the anticancer efficacy of YM155.
Although the growth of P3 was moderately inhibited by
sorafenib, the antitumor effect of YM155 observed was
significantly better under these conditions (Fig. 6B and
6C). Survivin expression was significantly inhibited in
the YM155-treated mice and TUNEL assays performed
on tumors isolated from the treatment groups further
demonstrated a significantly increase of apoptotic cells
in the YM155-treated group compared to treatment with
sorafenib (Fig. 6D).

The ability of cancer cells to grow under anchorageindependent condition is a property associated with
tumorigenesis. When Mahlavu and HLE cells were plated
separately in soft agar and treated with YM155 at 1ng/
ml and 10ng/ml, both Mahlavu and HLE cells showed a
statistically significant reduction in anchorage-independent
growth versus the medium controls (Fig. 4A and 4B). In
comparison, treatment of HuH7 and HepG2 cells with
YM155 under similar conditions gave insignificant
inhibition (Fig. 4C and 4D).
Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis
(IAP) gene family that plays important roles in regulating
cell division and apoptosis. When YM155-sensitive
Mahlavu and HLE cells were treated with 10ng/ml
YM155 for 12h, significant cell cycle arrest in the G2/M
phase was observed. The G2/M phase cell sub-population
of the HLE cells increased approximately 7-fold and a
4-fold increase was observed with the Mahlavu cells (Fig.
4E). Moreover, TUNEL-positive cells were significantly
increased for the YM155-sensitive Mahlavu and HLE
cells (Fig. 4F and 4G) compared to the YM155-resistant
HuH7 and HepG2 cells (Fig. S3A) after incubating with
10ng/ml YM155 for 24h. The induction of apoptosis in
the Mahlavu cells correlated well with the significant
increase in cleaved caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 4H). IHC
and Western Blot further demonstrated the stimulation
of γH2AX (pH2AX) expression in YM155-sensitive
Mahlavu and HLE cells (Fig. 4H and 4I) compared to
the YM155-resistant HuH7 and HepG2 cells (Fig. S3B),
indicating acceleration of DNA damage. The ability of
YM155 to inhibit the anchorage-independent cell growth,
to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA damage of
high survivin-expressing sensitive HCC cells suggests the
therapeutic potential of YM155 on this molecular subtype
of HCC cells.
To further decipher the molecular mechanisms
involved in the induction of cell death by YM155
towards high survivin-expressing sensitive HCC cells,
we performed comprehensive gene profiling analysis.
Differentially expressed genes when Mahlavu cells were
treated either with 10ng/ml YM155, 50nM survivinspecific siBIRC5, or the siRNA scramble control (Sigma),
were identified. The knockdown of survivin by siRNA was

DISCUSSION
While chemotherapy is one of the standard
methods of treatment for many human cancers, systemic
chemotherapy for HCC has been generally ineffective
[19]. Currently, sorafenib is the first and only FDAapproved molecularly targeted therapy for advanced
HCC. However, the clinical effectiveness of sorafenib
has been unimpressive and the improvement in overall
survival and time to progression is only approximately
3 months compared to placebo [6, 20]. Although novel
molecularly targeted drugs such as sunitinib, erlotinib,
linifanib, brivanib and everolimus are being developed,
none of these drugs (insofar as information is available)

has been dramatically effective [21]. One of the likely
explanation is the existence of intra-tumor phenotypic
heterogeneity which renders the accurate prediction of
treatment response a major clinical challenge [22].
Survivin (BIRC5) is a member of the IAPs
family that is overexpressed in most human cancers
and is not expressed in normal tissues. In this study, we
demonstrated that the expression and phosphorylation
of survivin was highly heterogeneous in HCC. YM155
is a known inhibitor of survivin and has been the subject
of several phase I and phase II clinical trials targeting
diffuse large cell lymphoma, prostate cancer, melanoma,
and NSCLC [12]. We demonstrated here that YM155sensitive cells (Mahlavu and HLE) showed significantly

elevated expression and phosphorylation of survivin while
the YM155-resistant HCC cells (HuH7 and HepG2) gave
relatively low survivin expression and phosphorylation.
Several clinical studies of YM155 against several
human cancers have been reported but it has not been
tested in HCC [12]. As a single agent, YM155 only
produced modest activity in patients with refractory,
advanced NSCLC [13]. The combination of YM155 with
carboplatin and paclitaxel gave a favourable safety profile
in advanced NSCLC but failed to produce an improvement
in the response rate [23]. Currently, two trials involving
YM155 and Rituximab against non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
and YM155 and docetaxel against breast cancer are still
active (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). Unfortunately, in all of

these trials (Supplementary Table S2), the heterogeneity of
survivin has not been considered in the protocol design and
no patient selection strategy has been incorporated. This
study clearly demonstrated that the level of survivin and
p-survivin expression could serve as molecular predictive
biomarkers to select potential YM155-responsive patients,
in a move towards delivering precision medicine for HCC
patients [24]. A >100-fold shifted in the sensitivity to
YM155 was observed for the high survivin-expressing
cells Mahlavu and HLE compared to the low survivinexpressing HuH7 and HepG2 cells.
Recently, Winter et al also reported the correlation
of the expression of the solute carrier SLC35F2 with
sensitivity to YM155 across a panel of cancer cell lines
[25]. However, we have checked and observed that the
expression of SLC35F2 in both our HCC dataset [22] and
the reported HCC dataset of Roessler et al [17] was not
differentially expressed between HCC and histologically
adjacent normal clinical samples (Fig. S5A and S5B).
Furthermore, we do not observe the heterogeneity of
SLC35F2 expression associated with the HCC clinical
tumor samples, indicating that SLC35F2 is unlikely to be
the sole factor defining the heterogeneous sensitivity of
HCC cells to YM155. The data presented here suggested
that survivin and p-survivin expression could provide
a comparatively better alternative for the stratification
of HCC patients for treatment with YM155 in novel
biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies.

The procedure was performed as described [16]
and the detail and antibodies were described in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Flow-cytometry
The cell cycle and apoptosis was analysed by flow
cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences) using PI
staining or Annexin V/7-AAD kits (BD Biosciences)
according to the standard protocol.

TUNEL assay
For labelling the nuclei of apoptotic cells, HCC cells
were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde 24 hours post-YM155 treatment.
TUNEL staining was performed using the DeadEnd
fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The number of TUNEL-positive
cells was divided by the number of Hoechst 33342- stained
cells to calculate the percentage of apoptotic nuclei.

Clonogenicity assay

METHODS

Cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated
with YM155 (1ng/ml or 10 ng/ml) in culture medium.
Upon the appearance of clones, the cells were fixed in
methanol for 3 minutes and stained with a 0.01% crystal
violet solution to assess colony formation. The number
of macroscopically detectable colonies was registered.
Treatments were performed in duplicate.

Cell viability
The

was

by
MTS
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetra
zolium] assays using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit from Promega
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each
experiment was repeated three times.

Animal studies
All experiments on mice were approved by the
SingHealth Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC). Sorafenib was administered at levels effective
on multiple tumor xenografts (30mg/kg po, daily). YM155
(10mg/kg) was administered via a 7-day continuous
infusion by intraperitoneal injections and followed by
observation for 7 days in 14-day treatment cycles. Tumor
growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging using
the Xenogen IVIS Lumina system (Xenogen Corporation,
Hopkinton, MA). Details of animal studies are provided in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

RNA extraction, microarray and RT-qPCR
analysis
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) and the quality and quantity of isolated total
RNA was assessed by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and
NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). The microarray and RT-qPCR analysis
were performed as described [15, 16]. Details are provided
