Abstract
Dysregulation in patterns of alternative RNA splicing in cancer cells is emerging as a signiﬁcant factor in cancer
pathophysiology. In this study, we investigated the little known alternative splice isoform survivin-3B (S-3B) that
is overexpressed in a tumor-speciﬁc manner. Ectopic overexpression of S-3B drove tumorigenesis by facilitating
immune escape in a manner associated with resistance to immune cell toxicity. This resistance was mediated by
interaction of S-3B with procaspase-8, inhibiting death-inducing signaling complex formation in response to Fas/
Fas ligand interaction. We found that S-3B overexpression also mediated resistance to cancer chemotherapy, in
this case through interactions with procaspase-6. S-3B binding to procaspase-6 inhibited its activation despite
mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation. When combined with chemotherapy, S-3B targeting
in vivo elicited a nearly eradication of tumors. Mechanistic investigations identiﬁed a previously unrecognized
7-amino acid region as responsible for the procancerous properties of survivin proteins. Taken together,
our results deﬁned S-3B as an important functional actor in tumor formation and treatment resistance. Cancer

Introduction
Alternative splicing is an important mechanism for the
generation of the variety of proteins indispensable for cell
functions. In normal cells, it is ﬁnely regulated to orchestrate
cellular processes. During cancer development, myriad
defects occur throughout cell transformation. Among these
defects, alternative splicing misregulation seems to be an
important factor. Misregulation of alternative splicing can
be observed in cancer cells in the absence of genomic
mutations of the genes concerned (1). In cancer cells,
aberrant alternative splicing can give rise to variants that
are speciﬁcally expressed in cancer tissues and completely
absent from normal ones (2).
Among alternative spliced genes, birc5, or survivin, is important as its expression is highly deregulated in cancer (3). First
described in 1997 (4), survivin undergoes alternative splicing

that can induce the expression of ﬁve different transcripts with
different functions: survivin, survivin-DEx3, survivin-2B (5),
survivin-3B (S-3B; ref. 6), and survivin-2a (7). Although survivin
was ﬁrst described as a tumor-speciﬁc gene, over the years it
has come to light that it is also expressed in normal cells where
its expression is necessary for cell-cycle progression (8–10). In
the present work, we highlighted that S-3B was a cancerspeciﬁc isoform. In addition, overexpression of this variant
induced tumorigenesis through the inhibition of tumor-directed immune-cell cytotoxicity by inhibiting death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation. Moreover, the expression of
S-3B gave a strong advantage to cancer cells exposed to cancer
treatment by blocking cell death through the inhibition of
procaspase-6 activation. In vivo, the targeting of S-3B, in
association with chemotherapy, greatly improved tumor
response to treatment. Finally, we identiﬁed a C-terminal 7amino acid domain in S-3B as a new protein domain responsible for protein functions.

Human samples
We studied survivin transcript expression by quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in 103 tumors and their adjacent
normal tissues from the breast, colon, stomach, kidney, uterus,
ovary, and liver. The study was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of the Centre Georges-François Leclerc (Dijon, France),
the Comite Consultatif de Protection des Personnes en
Recherche Biomedicale de Bourgogne. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrollment. All
samples were treated as described previously (11). The RNA
and proteins of 40 carcinomas and their adjacent normal
tissues were extracted by TRIzol reagent and protein pellets
were kept for Western blotting of the survivin isoform. The
same protocol was used for the analysis of tumors generated in
mice.
Reverse transcription, semi-quantitative, and
quantitative real-time PCR
Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR were conducted as
described previously (11, 12). The oligonucleotide sequences
used were: S-3B (forward: CCAGATGACGACCCCATAGAG,
reverse: CCCTGAATCTGGCTTCCAATT, Probe: CATTCGTCCGGTTGCGCTTTCC), mKlrb1c (forward: AAGGTTCACATTGCCAGACA, reverse: CACAGCTGCCATTTTCAGTG), mEOMS
(forward: ACATGCAGGGCAATAAGATG, reverse: GTCACTTCCACGATGTGCAG), mGranzyme B (forward: ACAAAGGCAGGGGAGATCAT, reverse: GCCCCCAAAGTGACATTTAT),
mPerforin (forward: GTGGGACTTCAGCTTTCCAG, reverse:
TAGTCACATCCATGCCTTCC), mFASL (forward: TTAAATGGGCCACACTCCTC, reverse: ACTCCGTGAGTTCACCAACC),
and mTRAIL (forward: TGGAGTCCCAGAAATCCTCA, reverse:
TCACCAACGAGATGAAGCAG).
S-3B overexpression and downexpression
The full-length of the S-3B coding sequence was obtained
using SuperScript One-Step long templates RT-PCR (Invitrogen) with 1.25 mg of total RNA. The insert was cloned by using
the Vivid Colors pcDNA6.2/CT-YFP-TOPO Mammalian
Expression Vector Kit (Invitrogen) as described by the
manufacturer.
RNA interference (RNAi) was achieved using S-3B-speciﬁc
siRNA located in the speciﬁc part of the S-3B sequence
(forward: AAUUGAGAGAGCUCUGUUAGCAGAA, reverse: UUCUGCUAACAGAGCUCUCUCAAUU). Scramble RNA with the
same nucleotide composition was used as the negative control.
The short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against S-3B was
obtained (based on siRNA sequence) after DNA duplex insertion into BLOCK-iT Inducible H1 entry Vector (Invitrogen) as
described by the manufacturer (validation of speciﬁcity in
Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C).
Survivin siRNA was provided by Ambion and its target
sequence was located at the junction of exon 3 and 4. This
siRNA induced the downregulation of survivin, survivin-DEx3,
survivin2B, and survivin-2a. S-3B was not inﬂuenced by this
siRNA.
Transient and stable transfections were carried out as
described previously (13, 14).

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were conducted as described previously
(12) with the following primary antibodies: b-actin, 1:25,000;
caspase-8, 1:100; caspase-10, 1:100; Bid, 1:2,000; caspase-9, 1:400;
caspase-3, 1:7,500; caspase-6, 1:20,000; caspase-7, 1:1,000; GFP,
1:50,000; Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD),
1:1,000; Fas, 1:1,000; survivin 1-12, 1:500; survivin, 1:5,000; S-3B,
1:5,000; and b-tubulin, 1:1,000. The S-3B antibody was produced
on demand by Millegen by using the KIERALLAE peptide as
epitope.
Immunoprecipitation assays
Immunoprecipitation assays were conducted on total protein extract with ExactaCruz matrix (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Dynabeads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by Western blot analysis by
using the input extract as the Western blot analysis–positive
control.
Apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential
assessments by FACS, and crystal violet staining for
cytotoxic and clonogenic tests
Cells were treated with Fas ligand (FasL; 1/20 supernatant),
or staurosporine (0.1 mmol/L). Apoptosis was assessed by using
the Annexin-V–PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed after 6 or
24 hours of treatment with FasL or chemotherapy drugs,
respectively, by measuring the reduction of MitoTracker Red
CM-H2XRos (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
For cytotoxic tests, 2,500 cells were cultured for 72 hours
with increasing doses of chemotherapy drugs [staurosporine,
5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin, etoposide, cisplatin, docetaxel, vinblastine, and vincristine].
For the natural killer (NK) cell-killing assay, NK cells were
obtained from mouse spleen and selected by using CD49b
Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and activated for 48 hours with
interleukin (IL)-2. Then, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded and
the NK cells were added with an increasing ratio (1 target cell
for 0 NK cell, 1/10, 1/50, 1/100, and 1 target cell for 200 NK cells).
MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with NK cells for 48 hours.
For clonogenic assays, cells were cultured with staurosporine or docetaxel for 24 hours. The treatment medium was then
replaced by classical growth medium and the cells were
incubated for 15 days.
At the end of these experiments, the cells still attached to the
plastic were stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution. For
cytotoxic tests, crystal violet was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and read with a spectrophotometer at 590 nm.
For clonogenic assays, colonies containing at least 50 cells were
manually counted. All experiments were carried out at least in
triplicate.
Determination of X-ray cytotoxicity using clonogenic
assay
The radiosensitivity of cell lines was determined by using
clonogenic assays according to the method previously described

(15). Brieﬂy, 1,000 cells were seeded into 6-well plates. The plates
were then irradiated 24 hours later at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 Gy by
a linear photon accelerator (clinac600, Varian).
After 15 days of incubation, the colonies were ﬁxed with
ethanol, stained with crystal violet (0.5% w/v), washed with tap
water, and counted using a colony counter pen.
Characterization of NK cells
At the end of the experiment, MDA-MB-231 tumors were
harvested and crushed. NK cells were separated from tumor
cells by Ficoll separation. NK cells were incubated with antiCD69, Nkp46, and NK1 antibodies and analyzed by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
In vivo experiments
All the mice were maintained in speciﬁc pathogen-free
conditions and all experiments followed the guidelines of the
Federation of European Animal Science Associations. All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of
Universite de Bourgogne (Dijon, France). For the tumorigenicity assay, 3  106 HBL100 or HBL100-3B cells in serum-free
culture medium were inoculated subcutaneously into the right
side of 8-week-old nude (nu/nu) BALB/c mice (Charles River
Laboratories; n ¼ 10 with 5 males and 5 females for each set of
cells). Afterward, the tumor diameter was evaluated weakly
using a caliper.
For the S-3B targeting assay, 5  106 MDA-MB-231 cells in
serum-free culture medium were inoculated subcutaneously
into the left side of 8-week-old nude (nu/nu) BALB/c mice.
Afterward, the tumor diameter was measured weekly using a
caliper. As soon as the tumor volume reached 8 or 40 mm3, the
mice were divided into two groups. The ﬁrst group (n ¼ 10)
received intratumoral injections of 300 pmol scRNA, whereas
the second (n ¼ 10) received intratumoral injections of 300
pmol siRNA. Both RNA were injected with Lipofectamine 2000.
The tumors were treated twice a week for 4 weeks.
For the NK-cell depletion experiments, the same protocol
was applied after one injection of 200 mg NK-blocking antibody
NK1.1 (BioXcell) per mouse per day for 3 days. NK depletion
was maintained by new injections once a week throughout the
experiments.
Finally, 5  106 Widr or MDA-MB-231 cells in serum-free
culture medium were inoculated subcutaneously into the left
side of 8-week-old nude (nu/nu) BALB/c mice. Afterward, the
tumor diameter was measured weekly using a caliper. As soon
as the tumor diameter reached 40 mm3, the mice were divided
into four groups. Two groups (n ¼ 2  10) received intratumoral injections of 300 pmol scRNA with 2 injections (at J0 and
J8) of either saline or 5-FU into the peritoneum, and the other
two groups (n ¼ 2  10) received intratumoral injections of 300
pmol siRNA with 2 injections of either saline or 5-FU into the
peritoneum. The tumors were treated twice a week for 6 weeks.

Results
S-3B is speciﬁcally expressed in carcinomas and
promotes tumorigenesis
The protein expression of S-3B was analyzed by Western blot
analysis in 17 cancer cell lines. Its expression was detectable in

www.aacrjournals.org

16 (94%) cell lines (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Then,
its expression was studied in 40 couples of tumors and their
adjacent normal tissues obtained from different organs. Whatever the organ of origin, S-3B was expressed in the tumor
sample and not in adjacent normal tissues (representative
result in Fig. 1B). To increase the number of patients, we
analyzed, at the transcriptional level, 103 couples of tumors
and their adjacent normal tissues. The data indicated that
the expression of S-3B was signiﬁcantly tumor speciﬁc (Fig. 1C;
P < 0.0001).
As S-3B is speciﬁcally expressed in tumor tissues and not in
normal tissues, we analyzed the effect of high S-3B expression
on tumorigenesis. For this, we used the nontumorigenic
HBL100 mammary cell line, in which we induced high S-3B
expression (Supplementary Fig. S1B). As controls, we also
analyzed the effect of survivin overexpression and the HBL100
growth in absence of NK cells. After subcutaneous injection of
these cells into nude mice, tumor growth was monitored for 50
days. Although control cells and survivin-overexpressing cells
did not develop into tumors, cells with a high level of S-3B were
able to generate tumors and promote tumor growth (Fig. 1D
and Supplementary Fig. S2A) without increasing cell proliferation in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Moreover, in absence
of NK cells, the nontumorigenic HBL100 cells were able to
grow (Fig. 2D). In conﬁrmation of these ﬁndings, the intratumoral injection of an anti-S-3B siRNA caused a considerable
slowdown of tumor growth of highly tumorigenic MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S2C) once again
without inﬂuencing cell proliferation in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. S2D).
S-3B induces resistance of cancer cells to natural killer
cell cytotoxicity
As MDA-MB-231 cells are very susceptible to NK cells (16)
and S-3B induced HBL100 cell growth in the presence of NK
cells, we tested the impact of S-3B targeting on tumor growth in
the absence of NK cells. The mice were given intraperitoneal
injections of an NK cell–blocking antibody, and the depletion
of NK cells was maintained throughout the experiment. The
results obtained in the previous experiment were conﬁrmed as
the treatment of tumors with siRNA induced a substantial
slowdown of tumor growth in mice treated with the isotype
antibody (Fig. 2A; CTRL vs. siRNA). The absence of NK cells did
not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence tumor growth of tumors treated
with scramble RNA (Fig. 2A; CTRL vs. Ab). When tumors were
treated with siRNA in the absence of NK cells, the growth
slowdown induced by siRNA injection was completely lost (Fig.
2A; siRNA vs. siRNAþAb). Besides, siRNA treatment also had
no effect on tumor growth in the absence of NK cells (Fig. 2A;
Ab vs. siRNA þ Ab). These data showed that NK cells were
involved in the slowdown of tumor growth in animals treated
with siRNA. As a comparison, we analyzed the impact of
survivin siRNA injection on MDA-MB-231 tumor growth. The
injection of survivin siRNA decreased tumor growth in the
presence of NK cells but this decrease was slightly less efﬁcient
than S-3B siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2E).
Then, in nondepleted mice, we assessed the inﬁltration of
NK cells into tumors. For this, we analyzed the Nkp46

Figure 1. S-3B is speciﬁcally expressed in carcinomas and promotes tumorigenesis. A, S-3B was expressed at the protein level in all tested cell lines except
SW1116. b-Actin was used as the loading control. B, S-3B was detected in tumors and not in normal tissues. These Western blot analyses were representative
of data obtained from the 40 studied couples. b-Actin was used as the loading control. C, we studied S-3B mRNA expression in 103 tumors and their
adjacent normal tissues from different origins (breast, colon, stomach, kidney, liver, etc.). S-3B expression was undetectable in normal tissues but was
present in tumors. S-3B expression was more than 36 times greater in tumors than in nonmalignant tissues. D, contrary to survivin, the overexpression of
S-3B induced the development and growth of nontumorigenic cells injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Although control cells did not form tumors,
S-3B–overexpressing cells were able to develop tumors that had grown exponentially 30 days after injection. In NK cell–depleted mice, control cells
were able to grow, but slower than S-3B–overexpressing cells. Day 0 corresponds to the cell-injection day. The arrow shows an aspeciﬁc band recognized by

siRNA (or scramble RNA as control) was injected into the tumor every 4 days for 28 days. Compared with control, the siRNA dramatically slowed tumor growth.

expression by FACS. The data obtained indicated that NK cells
were present in both control and siRNA-treated tumors and
that the extinction of S-3B did not inﬂuence the inﬁltration of
NK cells (Fig. 2B). This result suggested that tumor behavior in
response to siRNA was not dependent on the inﬁltration of NK
cells into the tumor. Once inﬁltrated, NK cells are activated. We
analyzed the transcriptional expression of mouse Granzyme B,
EOMS, Perforin, FasL, and Trail in control tumors and siRNAtreated tumors. We also analyzed the membrane expression of
CD69 and NK1 by ﬂow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2C, the
activation level of NK cells was the same whatever the tumor
treatment (Fig. 2C). In Fig. 2D, the characterization of NK cells
indicated that Nkp46þ:CD69þ and NK1þ/CD69þ cells were
present in the same proportion in tumors. Finally, we conducted a killing assay by using IL-2–activated NK cells obtained
from mice or FasL. In S-3B–overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells,
NK cells and FasL had a very slight cytotoxic effect compared
with control cells. In contrast, the complete absence of S-3B
strongly sensitized MDA-MB-231 cells to NK cell and FasL
cytotoxicity (Fig. 2E and F).

Taken together, these data showed that S-3B made cancer
cells resistant to the cytotoxic activity of NK cells.
S-3B inhibits cytotoxic cell–induced apoptosis through
the inhibition of DISC assembly
NK cells induce cell death through two different pathways: death domain receptors (Fas/FasL, Trail) and Granzyme B. Although the death domain receptor pathway is the
predominant pathway for tumor cell killing by NK cells,
especially Fas/FasL (17), Granzyme B did not seem to be
necessary for NK cell–mediated tumor rejection (18). We
therefore explored apoptosis induced by NK cells through
the activation of the death domain receptor Fas. Apoptosis
induced by FasL was inhibited by S-3B overexpression
and strongly ampliﬁed in cells treated with si/shRNA without inﬂuencing the expression of Fas (Fig. 3A). To the
contrary, the survivin expression variation had no effect
on cells sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, the
analysis of mitochondrion depolarization showed that the
inhibition occurred upstream from the mitochondria (Fig.

Figure 2. S-3B induces resistance of cancer cells to NK cell cytotoxicity. A, in mice injected with the isotype antibody, tumors treated with scramble RNA (CTRL)
presented exponential growth, whereas the tumors treated with siRNA (siRNA) showed a substantial slowdown of development. In mice injected with NK
cell–blocking antibody, the tumors injected with scramble RNA (Ab) showed the same growth as control (CTRL). In the absence of NK cells, the siRNA
injection (siRNAþAb) had no effect on tumor growth as the tumor development was the same as for control, Ab, and siRNAþAb subsets. B, the membrane
expression of mouse Nkp46 (speciﬁc marker of mouse NK cells) was analyzed in MDA-MB-231 tumors extracted from nude mice. Whatever the injection given
(control or siRNA), the inﬁltration of mouse NK cells was the same and not inﬂuenced by intratumoral injections. C, the mRNA expression of mouse
EOMS, Granzyme B, Perforin, FasL, and TRAIL was analyzed in MDA-MB-231 tumors extracted from nude mice and normalized with mKlrb1c expression.
Whatever the injection given (control or siRNA), the expression of these mouse NK cell genes was the same and not inﬂuenced by intratumoral injections.

Compared with control cells, S-3B–overexpressing cells (S-3B) were resistant to the toxicity of NK cells and FasL. In contrast, anti-S-3B siRNA cells or shRNA
stably transfected cells (si/shRNA) showed a strong sensitivity to NK cells and FasL (n ¼ 4–16).  , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001; #, nonsigniﬁcant.

3B). Western blot analysis experiments indicated that S-3B
was able to block the induction of extrinsic apoptosis
(inhibition of activation of caspase-8, caspase-10, inhibition
of cleavage of Bid in tBid, and inhibition of caspase-3
activation) when it was overexpressed, whereas its downregulation augmented the effect of FasL treatment on these
proapoptotic proteins (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
As the interaction between Fas and FasL induces the
formation of DISC, we analyzed the involvement of S-3B
in the formation of DISC. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments, we highlighted that S-3B was able to interact

with procaspase-8 (Fig. 3D) but not with procaspase-10
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). This interaction induced the
sequestration of procaspase-8 and the inhibition of any
interaction between procaspase-8 and FADD (Fig. 3D).
These results indicated that S-3B inhibited the DISC by
inhibiting extrinsic pathways.
S-3B inhibits cancer treatment-induced cell death
As shown above, S-3B is able to inhibit extrinsic apoptosis by
directly interacting with procaspase-8 and thus blocking DISC
formation. As S-3B has already shown its ability to inhibit

Figure 3. S-3B inhibits cytotoxic cell induced apoptosis through the inhibition of DISC assembly. A, apoptosis assay was conducted by FACS by using Annexin
V/7-AAD staining after FasL treatment. Compared with MDA-MB-231 control cells (CTRL), S-3B–overexpressing cells (S-3B) were less sensitive to
FasL exposure, whereas S-3B–downexpressing cells (si/shRNA) showed strong sensitivity to FasL. Moreover, the expression variation of S-3B did not
inﬂuence Fas protein expression in cells. B, mitochondrial depolarization analysis showed that, unlike control cells, S-3B–expressing cells did not
show depolarization of mitochondria, whereas about 90% of cells without S-3B (si/shRNA) presented mitochondrial depolarization (n ¼ 3). C, the activation of
caspases-8, -10, and -3 and the cleavage of Bid in tBid in response to FasL were analyzed by Western blotting. The overexpression of S-3B inhibited
the activation of caspases-8, -10, and -3, and the appearance of Bid. The extinction of S-3B (si/shRNA) dramatically increased the activation of these proteins.
Band density was assessed by using ImageJ software and b-actin was used for loading normalization. Bar graphs represent the mean  SD of three
different experiments. D, immunoprecipitation experiments after 24-hour FasL exposure showed that S-3B interacted with procaspase-8 to inhibit DISC
formation. Thus, procaspase-8 was unable to interact with FADD and therefore could not be activated by proteolytic cleavage. All experiments were repeated

extrinsic apoptosis, we tested whether S-3B could play a role in
the intrinsic apoptosis pathway triggered by Granzyme B (19)
or cancer treatments. We used staurosporine, which is known
to induce intrinsic apoptosis. Although the overexpression
of S-3B greatly reduced the cytotoxicity of staurosporine, its
extinction sensitized cells to the drug (Fig. 4A). Using FACS
with Annexin V/7-7-Aminoactinomycin D (AAD) staining
experiments, we conﬁrmed that cell death induced by staurosporine was apoptosis, and that, contrary to survivin (Supplementary Fig. S4A), S-3B protected cells from this stress (Fig.
4B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Moreover, S-3B had a real
protective effect as cells overexpressing S-3B had a strong

clonogenic capacity after staurosporine treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
We next tested the inﬂuence of S-3B on the mitochondrial
depolarization that occurred during treatment with staurosporine. Surprisingly, it seemed that the inhibition of cell death
by S-3B occurred downstream from the mitochondria (Fig. 4C).
At the protein level, treatment with staurosporine was accompanied by the activation of caspase-9, -3, and -7 in control,
S-3B–overexpressing, and S-3B–downexpressing cells. However, it seemed that the activation of procaspase-6 was inﬂuenced by S-3B. Although the overexpression of S-3B reduced
the cleavage of procaspase-6, the absence of S-3B (siRNA

Figure 4. S-3B inhibits cancer treatment-induced cell death. A, cytotoxic tests were carried out on MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing or downexpressing
(stably or transiently) S-3B. Cells were exposed to increasing doses of staurosporine (mmol/L) for 48 hours. The percentage of living cells is plotted as mean 
SD (n ¼ 3–6). Compared with control cells (CTRL), S-3B–overexpressing cells (S-3B) were less sensitive to sturosporine, whereas S-3B–downexpressing cells
(si/shRNA) showed strong sensitivity to this drug. B, the apoptosis assay was conducted by FACS by using Annexin V/7-AAD staining after staurosporine
treatment. These data showed that, compared with control cells (CTRL), overexpressing cells (S-3B) were more resistant to apoptosis, whereas
S-3B–downexpressing cells (si/shRNA) showed a high level of apoptosis. C, mitochondrial depolarization analysis showed that, in response to staurosporine,
S-3B did not inﬂuence mitochondrial depolarization whatever its expression level. D, the activation of caspases-9, -3, -6, and -7 in response to staurosporine
was analyzed by Western blotting. The overexpression of S-3B (S-3B) inhibited the activation of caspase-6 without inhibiting caspases-9, -3, and -7.
The extinction of S-3B (si/shRNA) dramatically increased the cleavage of procaspase-6. Caspase-9, -3, and -7 activation was not inﬂuenced by the
downregulation of S-3B in response to staurosporine. E, immunoprecipitation experiments after 48 hours of treatment with staurosporine showed that
S-3B interacted with procaspase-6 to inhibit its association with caspase-3 and therefore its activation. Thus, S-3B did not interact with caspase-3. F, Widr

of S-3B, as shown by apoptosis and clonogenic assays (Fig. 4C
and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
As S-3B inhibited procaspase-6 activation without inhibiting
caspase-3 activity in response to staurosporine, we analyzed
the putative interaction between S-3B and procaspase-6. Using
immunoprecipitation experiments, we showed that S-3B interacted with procaspase-6 and inhibited its interaction with
active caspase-3 (Fig. 4E). These observations showed that
S-3B blocked procaspase-6 activation, and therefore the cleavage of its substrates, and ﬁnally apoptosis. We also analyzed
whether S-3B was also able to interact with survivin. After
staurosporine treatment, no interaction between S-3B and
survivin was observed (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The inhibition of apoptosis by S-3B was also present in response to 5-FU
(by the same mechanism described above; Supplementary Fig.
S5C), epirubicin, etoposide, cisplatin, X-rays, docetaxel, and
vincristine (Supplementary Fig. S6).
As S-3B played an important role in the protection of cells
against apoptotic stimuli, we analyzed the expression of S3B in six cancer cell lines (A459, HL60, K562, KBV1, MCF-7,
and RPMI) that were sensitive or resistant to docetaxel,
adriamycin, doxorubicin, or vinblastine. The data obtained
indicated that S-3B expression increased with the acquisition of resistance (Supplementary Fig. S7). As the involvement of S-3B in cancer cell resistance was conﬁrmed, we
tested the impact of S-3B targeting in vitro on the behavior
of different cancer cell lines from different tissues (breast,
brain, colon, and cervix) in response to different drugs. S-3B
targeting sensitized all tested cell lines to numerous tested
drugs (Supplementary Table S1), and notably to drugs that
are used in clinics as the reference treatment (5-FU and
docetaxel for breast cancer, 5-FU and cisplatin for colon
cancer, vincristine and vinblastine for brain cancer, and
cisplatin and docetaxel for cervical cancer).
Finally, we carried out in vivo experiments to explore the
therapeutic effect of targeting S-3B. For this, we used colon
cancer NK-resistant Widr cells (20) and the mammary cancer
NK-sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells. By using these cell lines, it was
possible to observe the impact of chemotherapy and S-3B
targeting alone, in the absence of NK-cell toxicity, on tumor
growth for Widr cells. With MDA-MB-231 cells, we could
observe a possible synergistic effect between NK cell toxicity
and chemotherapy treatment. We combined intratumoral
injections of siRNA with systemic 5-FU. As expected in Widr
cells (Fig. 4F, top), the intratumoral injection of siRNA did not
affect tumor growth even in the presence of NK cells (CTRL vs.
siRNA lines). Treatment with 5-FU slightly decreased tumor
growth compared with control (CTRL vs. 5-FU lines). The
combination of treatment with 5-FU and injections of siRNA
induced a stabilization of tumor volume, showing that siRNA
had a signiﬁcant positive effect on tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy (5-FU vs. 5-FUþsiRNA lines). For MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 4F, bottom), 5-FU treatment decreased tumor
growth compared with control (CTRL vs. 5-FU lines). The
combination of siRNA and 5-FU resulted in a stabilization
followed by a decrease of tumor volume (5-FUþsiRNA line).
These data clearly showed that S-3B could be a promising
therapeutic target.

The C-terminal domain of S-3B is indispensable for its
protective properties
S-3B possesses a complete BIR domain and a speciﬁc 7amino acid sequence (that we named the LEO domain) at the
C-terminal: ERALLAE (Fig. 5A). For these experiments, we
generated cells that stably overexpressed truncated S-3B
(S-3B without the LEO domain). The truncated S-3B was
unable to protect cells against staurosporine (Fig. 5B and
Supplementary Fig. S8). At the protein level, unlike overexpression of the full S-3B, overexpression of the truncated
form was unable to inhibit the activation of procaspase-6
(Fig. 5C). This absence of inhibition was explained by the
lack of any interaction between truncated S-3B and procaspase-6 (Fig. 5D). For extrinsic apoptosis, the same observations were made. Truncated S-3B was unable to inhibit
procaspase-8 activation (Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig.
S9) due to the deﬁciency of any interaction between truncated S-3B and procaspase-8 (Fig. 5F). The importance of the
LEO domain was conﬁrmed by cytotoxic tests in response to
X-rays and clonogenic tests in response to staurosporine
(Supplementary Fig. S10A and S10B, respectively). Taken
together, these results showed that the protection properties
of S-3B involve an unsuspected new protein domain that
comprises 7 amino acids (LEO domain).

Discussion
The deregulation of alternative splicing in cancer can be
responsible for the tumor-speciﬁc expression of protein. The
appearance of these proteins gives strong advantages to malignant cells for their development and propagation throughout
the organism. Moreover, their tumor-speciﬁc expression proﬁle makes them potential therapeutic targets. Here, we showed
that the alternative splice variant S-3B is speciﬁcally expressed
in tumors from various organs (breast, colon, kidney, etc.), and
that its expression can play a role in tumorigenesis. Indeed, its
overexpression allowed the growth of nontumorigenic cells in
nude mice. We also showed that this tumorigenesis capacity
was due to the resistance of cancer cells to the toxicity of NK
cells. We pointed out that this inhibition was due to a speciﬁc
interaction of S-3B with procaspase-8. This interaction
completely blocked the formation of DISC, which is the ﬁrst
step of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (21). S-3B, like FLIP, is a
new inhibitor of the DISC (22). Consequently, S-3B allowed the
immune escape of cells, as tumor cell growth was diminished
by NK cells when S-3B was downregulated. The immune escape
of malignant cells is directly involved in cancer development,
whatever the tissue of origin, and is now a potential target for
clinical investigations on the microenvironment and NK cells
(23). In addition, the targeting of S-3B could be a potential
means to sensitize tumor cells to the immune system without
the risk of modifying exogenous NK cells. Indeed, it seemed
that the inﬁltrating NK cells were identically activated and in
same proportion in siRNA-treated tumors compared with
control ones.
Another important aspect of the impact of S-3B on cancer
cells is its ability to confer resistance to anticancer treatments.
Up to now, only two studies have reported S-3B as a potential
antiapoptotic protein in response to cisplatin (24) or 5-FU (25).

Figure 5. The C-terminal domain of S-3B is indispensable for its protective properties. A, the three-dimensional structure showed that S-3B possesses
a BIR domain and harbored a speciﬁc 7-amino acid domain ERALLAE. B, cytotoxic tests were carried out on MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing
(stably or transiently) YFP (CTRL), S-3B, or S-3B truncated for its speciﬁc 7-amino acid domain. Living cells were stained with crystal violet. The percentage of
living cells is plotted as mean  SD (n ¼ 3–6). S-3B–overexpressing cells (S-3B) were more resistant than control cells (CTRL). In contrast, cells with truncated
S-3B showed the same sensitivity as control cells. C, the activation of caspase-6 in response to staurosporine was analyzed by Western blot analysis.
After treatment with staurosporine, the overexpression of S-3B (S-3B) inhibited the activation of caspase-6. The truncation of S-3B (truncated S-3B)
induced the loss of this inhibitory potential. Band density was assessed by using ImageJ software and b-actin was used for loading normalization. Bar graphs
represent the mean  SD of three different experiments. D, immunoprecipitation after 48 hours of treatment with staurosporine indicated that S-3B
interacted with procaspase-6, whereas truncated S-3B was unable to bind procaspase-6. E, the activation of caspases-8 in response to FasL was analyzed by
Western blot analysis. The overexpression of S-3B (S-3B) inhibited the activation of caspases-8. As in control cells (CTRL), the truncation of S-3B (truncated S3B) did not inhibit the activation of these proteins.

In our work, we showed that S-3B expression dramatically
increased during the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy. It is now accepted that mitochondrial depolarization is a
point-of-no-return of the lethal process (26) and that the
presence of active caspase-3 is a marker of apoptosis (27),
and therefore cell death. In this study, we showed that in
response to activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, S-3B
acted downstream from the mitochondria by preventing active
caspase-3–mediated cleavage of procaspase-6 (at least after
staurosporine and 5-FU treatment). Despite mitochondrial

www.aacrjournals.org

depolarization and caspase-3 activation, cells that overexpressed S-3B did not die as indicated by their high clonogenic
potential. Furthermore, a recent study described the important
role of active caspase-3 in cancer. Caspase-3 activation during
the apoptotic process stimulates tumor cell repopulation after
radiotherapy (28). On the basis of this work, we can imagine
that, in the presence of a high level of S-3B, the activation of
caspase-3 in response to radio- or chemotherapy could potentiate the metastatic capacity of tumor cells. As cells did not die,
this could amplify the metastasis phenomenon rather than the

repopulation of the tumor site. This may explain the previously
reported poor disease-free and overall survival in patients with
breast carcinoma expressing a high level of S-3B and treated
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (29, 30). The roles of S-3B in
the inhibition of apoptosis are summarized in Fig. 6.
We showed that S-3B could be a therapeutic target in
association with chemotherapy. The extinction of S-3B by
siRNA combined with treatment with 5-FU clearly decreased
tumor volume. These results clearly indicated that targeting S3B sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapy. Currently, the
survivin suppressor YM155 is under clinical development in
phase I/II studies. It has proved to be quite well tolerated but
has relatively low efﬁcacy (31, 32). Nevertheless, this small
molecule might not be working by survivin suppression alone,
which could explain its low toxicity and limited efﬁcacy (33).
Contrary to survivin, whose expression is necessary for mitotic
progression in normal cells (10), S-3B is only present in tumors,
making S-3B a very interesting therapeutic target with potentially low levels of side effects. This suggests that the systemic
targeting of S-3B could be considered a potentially safe and
effective therapy for clinical trials.
Finally, unlike other BIR domains, which contain proteins
that interact with active caspases-3 and -7, but not with
caspase-8 (34), S-3B is able to bind procaspase-8 and procaspase-6. Here, we showed that S-3B interacted with procaspase8 and procaspase-6 thanks to its 7-amino acid C-terminal
domain, which we named the LEO domain.
In conclusion, this work (i) identiﬁed S-3B as an actor of
tumor immune escape and tumor resistance to cancer treatment; (ii) highlighted the fact that despite mitochondrial
depolarization and caspase-3 activation, S-3B expressing cells
did not die; (iii) pointed out that S-3B could be a good

therapeutic target as targeting S-3B decreased tumor volume,
and as S-3B expression is tumor speciﬁc, suggesting the
potential selectivity of malignant tissues; (iv) identiﬁed a new
and unsuspected protein domain (the LEO domain) as a
potential new protein domain with cytoprotective properties.
