BACKGROUND: In vitro and in vivo studies suggested that combination of lipid formulation of amphotericin B
(L-AMB) and echinocandins may have a synergistic or additive effect against Aspergillus. Furthermore, clinical studies
suggested that this combination may improve response of invasive aspergillosis (IA). METHODS: Between August
1993 and June 2008, the authors identified a total of 159 patients with hematological malignancies who received salvage therapy for IA, with L-AMB alone, echinocandins alone, or a combination of L-AMB and echinocandins. Clinical
characteristics, response to salvage therapy, and death up to 12 weeks after initiation of salvage therapy were retrospectively determined for all patients. RESULTS: Seventy patients received salvage therapy with L-AMB, 18 patients
received echinocandins alone (89% of whom received caspofungin), and 71 patients received the combination therapy of amphotericin B and echinocandins (90% of who received caspofungin). The 3 salvage treatment groups were
comparable in regard to clinical characteristics; graft versus host disease was more frequently encountered in the
echinocandin group, whereas more patients in the L-AMB and combination groups had neutropenia and received
immunotherapy. The response to salvage therapy was better in the echinocandin group (9% L-AMB, 28% echinocandins, and 21% for combination therapy). The 3 groups had a comparable rate of Aspergillus-related death (58%-64%)
and overall mortality (61%-67%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of L-AMB and echinocandins offered no advantage
in terms of improving response or reducing mortality over either drug alone. Hence, this combination will only add to
the cost of therapy without any improvement in outcome in patients with hematological malignancies. Cancer

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains the most common opportunistic mold infection and major cause for morbidity
and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies.1-4 Historically, amphotericin B formulations have been standard therapy for IA; however, in the current decade new antifungal agents have been introduced. Echinocandins, originally
identified in 1974, have been increasingly used in the past several years owing to a unique mechanism of action, high efficacy, and favorable safety profile.5,6 Because they have a different mechanism of action compared with other classes of
antifungal agents, several studies have looked at the potential benefit of combination therapy. Data derived from in vitro
studies as well as animal models have suggested that combination of lipid formulation of amphotericin B (L-AMB) and
echinocandins may have a synergistic or additive effect against Aspergillus.7,8 Furthermore, clinical studies suggested that
this combination may improve response of IA.9-12

review board. Inclusion criteria included patients with
hematological malignancies, of any age, with proven or
probable diagnoses of IA according to criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
Mycosis Study Group.13 Patients with possible diagnosis
of IA were not included.
We identified 315 patients with hematological
malignancies, either refractory or intolerant to multiple
previous antifungal therapies, who received salvage therapy. We selected a group of 159 patients who received
echinocandins alone, L-AMB alone, or a combination of
echinocandins and L-AMB. If a patient had >1 episode of
salvage treatment, we included only their first episode.
The following demographic and clinical information was recorded for all study patients: age, sex, underlying hematological malignancies, history of hematopoietic
stem cell transplant, presence of graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD), duration of neutropenia, persistence of neutropenia during therapy, high-dose steroid use (defined as
the equivalent of 600 mg of prednisone), tacrolimus use,
immunotherapy during infection including white blood
cell transfusion, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF), interferon-gamma (IFN-c), intensive
care unit (ICU) stay, and need for mechanical ventilation.
Type and site of either definite or probable IA along with
prior antifungal prophylaxis and therapy were also
recorded. Outcomes were assessed at the end of each salvage episode and up to 12 weeks after initiation of salvage
therapy. Autopsy data were not available.
Definitions
Breakthrough IA was defined as an infection in a patient
receiving systemic prophylactic antifungals with known
activity against Aspergillus species for at least 7 days before
the onset of IA. Primary antifungal therapy included all
antifungal drug regimes that patients received before the
institution of the salvage therapy consisting of echinocandins alone, L-AMB alone, or the combination of echinocandins and L-AMB.
Favorable response was defined as complete or partial resolution of clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic
abnormalities attributable to IA compared with baseline.14 Unfavorable outcome was defined as progression
or stable infection based on worsening or nonresolution
of clinical and radiographic abnormalities and persistently
positive cultures, histopathological findings, or aspergillus
antigen assays. Aspergillosis was considered to have contributed to the death of a patient if the patient died with

clinical and radiographic evidence of aspergillosis and had
not had a favorable response to the salvage therapy. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in creatinine of 2
baseline value. Hepatotoxicity was defined as a 3-fold
increase in either bilirubin and transaminase or alkaline
phosphatase and transaminase compared with baseline.
Primary endpoint evaluated outcome at the end of
salvage therapy, which was defined as the point where the
studied salvage treatment was stopped by the primary
physician, based on evidence of satisfactory response, progression of infection, intolerance, or death.
Statistical Methods
Categorical variables were compared by chi-square or
Fisher exact tests and continuous variables by Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests. Survival analysis was performed on
patients’ survival within 12 weeks after initiation of the
salvage therapy in the study. The survival probability was
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier approach for each group
of patients, and was compared among different groups by
a log-rank test. In addition, multiple logistic regression
method was used to evaluate the independent effect of the
salvage therapy of interest on patients’ response. All tests
were 2-sided, and the statistical significance was set at P 
.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Characteristics of Patients
From August 1993 to June 2008, 159 patients for whom
salvage therapy consisted of echinocandins alone, L-AMB
alone, or a combination of both echinocandins and
L-AMB were identified. Patients were divided into 3
groups; 18 patients were treated with echinocandins alone
as salvage therapy, whereas 70 patients received L-AMB
alone. Seventy-one patients received a combination of
both echinocandins and L-AMB. Eighty-nine percent (16
of 18) of the echinocandins salvage therapy episodes consisted of caspofungin and 11% (2 of 18) of anidulafungin.
The majority of the combination salvage therapy episodes
(90%) consisted of caspofungin and L-AMB.
Among all 3 groups, 36% (57 of 159) of the salvage
episode corresponded to patients with a definite diagnosis
of IA, whereas 64% (102 of 159) corresponded to patients
with a probable diagnosis of IA (Table 1). The majority of
IA consisted of invasive pulmonary infection (16 of 18
episodes with echinocandins, 58 of 70 episodes with LAMB, and 57 of 71 episodes with combination therapy).

with granulocyte transfusion during the study period when
compared with the echinocandin group (P ¼ .01). A higher
percentage (56%) of patients receiving echinocandins had
GVHD (P ¼ .008) and were receiving tacrolimus therapy
on diagnosis (Table 1).
The majority of patients received antifungal prophylaxis; there was no statistically significant difference in rate
of breakthrough infection in all 3 groups (Table 2). The
duration of primary therapy was similar in all groups. A
comparable proportion of patients experienced toxicity to
primary therapy.
Response and Survival
Twenty-one percent of patients receiving combination
therapy (L-AMB and echinocandins) achieved a favorable
outcome at the end of salvage therapy versus 28% of
patients receiving echinocandins therapy and 9% of
patients receiving L-AMB therapy (28% vs 9%, P ¼ .04).
The patients receiving L-AMB had a significantly shorter
duration of therapy (Table 3). Furthermore, the combination therapy with L-AMB and echinocandins offered no
advantage in reducing overall mortality. All 3 groups had a
comparable rate of overall death, with a range of 61% to
67%. The rate of Aspergillus-related death was also similar
among all 3 groups, with a mean of 63%.
In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the factors
that were independently associated with the response
included GVHD, immunotherapy during infection,

salvage therapy during the study. Patients with GVHD
(odds ratio [OR], 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.04-0.8; P ¼ .027) and patients receiving immunotherapy during infection (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.9; P ¼
.029) were less likely to have favorable response. Patients
who had an azole-containing regimen as their primary
therapy (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.2-19.1; P ¼ .03), patients
who had a favorable response to the primary therapy (OR,
7.8; 95% CI, 1.3-48.3; P ¼ .028), and patients with a longer duration of the salvage therapy (OR, 1.07; 95% CI,
1.04-1.1; P<.0001) were more likely to have a favorable
response to the salvage therapy in the study.

of patients during a 12-week period of follow-up after the
initiation of salvage therapy is illustrated in Figure 1.
There has been no significant difference in survival among
the 3 groups of patients (P ¼ .9).

DISCUSSION
In this study, combination of L-AMB and echinocandins
for proven or probable IA in patients with hematological
malignancies offered no survival advantage or improved
response when compared with either drug alone.
Response rates have overall been lower than in other published reports, likely because our patient population was
sicker, almost half of them being critically ill. Also, in contrast to other studies, combination therapy did not appear
to be more effective in patients with persistent neutropenia. Addition of immunotherapy such as granulocyte
transfusion was associated with less favorable outcome.
Echinocandins, originally identified in 1974, are
inhibitors of fungal cell wall synthesis.5 They exert selective antifungal activity by inhibition of beta-glucan synthase, resulting in formation of aberrantly growing fungal
hyphae. When administered to animals infected with
Aspergillus species, echinocandins appear to prolong survival, although high fungal counts usually persist in the
tissues.15 More recent studies have suggested an immunomodulatory role for echinocandins through stage-specific
beta-glucan exposure, which may activate not only polymorphonuclear cells but also monocytes and macrophages.16,17 Because different classes of antifungals use
different mechanisms of action, combination therapy
appears an attractive concept.
In vitro studies have suggested that caspofungin and
amphotericin B combination was synergistic or additive
in >50% of the 14 species of Aspergillus tested.7 Subsequent animal studies have suggested that combination of
echinocandins with liposomal amphotericin B may have
some benefit.8
Early clinical reports have suggested that the combination of caspofungin and L-AMB appears safe and generally well tolerated and translated into an overall favorable

response in 60% of 26 patients with acute leukemia and
refractory pulmonary aspergillosis.9 However, only 6 of
the 26 patients enrolled had a diagnosis of proven aspergillosis. A larger, multicenter study involving 53 patients
with documented IA receiving salvage therapy in many
combinations including caspofungin-triazole and caspofungin-polyene suggested that the 50% of the patients
receiving the combination caspofungin-polyene had a
favorable response at the end of combination therapy and
Day 84 visit, but the overall number of patients enrolled
in this arm was relatively small (16 patients).10
A randomized, open, pilot study of 30 patients comparing high-dose L-AMB versus combination of low-dose
L-AMB with caspofungin found significantly more favorable responses in the combination arm, which translated
into survival benefit at 12 weeks; the small size and the
open label design of the study make the interpretation of
the results more difficult.11 Lastly, a report from our institution evaluated 31 patients who received the combination caspofungin and L-AMB for refractory aspergillosis;

35% of these patients responded to this combination.12
When caspofungin was studied as a single agent for treatment of refractory aspergillosis, an overall response rate of
45% was noted; however, only 22% of these patients were
allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients, and only 26%
had neutropenia.18
Herein we report the results of a retrospective analysis of 159 patients receiving salvage therapy for proven
and probable IA over a time span of 15 years, which to
our knowledge is among the largest series published to
date. Thirty-six percent of these episodes were because of
proven disease. Our results indicate that combination
therapy appears to offer no advantage over L-AMB or
echinocandins as single drugs, with a response rate ranging from 9% to 28%. The favorable response rate in our
study is lower than in the previously reported data, probably due to the fact that we enrolled a higher overall number of patients with documented severe infection, in the
setting of advanced hematological malignancies; almost
half of the study patients required ICU admission, for a
median of 8 to 11 days; over a third of the patients
required mechanical ventilation. Aspergillus-related mortality and overall mortality appeared no different between
the 3 groups, ranging 58% to 64% and 61% to 67%,
respectively, significantly higher when compared with
other studies.
The 3 groups were similar in regard to underlying
host factors, including receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell
transplant and steroid use, as well as in regard to characteristics of IA. Some of the patients received immunotherapy, aimed to enhance the host immune response in
clearance of invasive fungal infections, including G-CSF,
GM-CSF, INF-c, and granulocyte transfusions.19,20
Although the proportion of patients with persistent
neutropenia was similar between the 3 groups, neutropenia at onset of IA was overall more frequently encountered

in the L-AMB and combination arm, whereas GVHD
was present more often in the echinocandin group. As a
result, usage of G-CSF and granulocyte transfusions was
significantly higher in L-AMB and combination groups,
without additional benefit in favorable response at the
end of therapy. Moreover, in multivariate analysis both
GVHD and receipt of immunotherapy were associated
with less favorable response. One possible explanation is
that addition of immunotherapy, particularly granulocyte
transfusion, may induce significant pulmonary inflammatory responses with clinical and radiographic deterioration. However, among all salvage episodes with favorable
response, the use of additional immune-enhancing therapy made no difference. Alternatively, echinocandins may
have exerted their therapeutic effect in the absence of
additional immune-enhancing strategies, particularly in
patients with GVHD.
Previous studies suggested that combination therapy
appears beneficial especially in patients with poor prognostic features such as neutropenia or refractory leukemia.
In our study, data regarding refractory leukemia were not
available; however, for patients with persistent neutropenia, combination therapy offered no advantage compared
with single-agent therapy.
Predictably, there were fewer adverse events in the
echinocandins arm compared with the L-AMB and combination arms. It is well accepted that echinocandins have
a favorable adverse events profile and are generally very
well tolerated. In the echinocandins arm, fewer salvage
episodes were complicated by development of liver function abnormalities and none by renal impairment. The
duration of salvage therapy with L-AMB alone was
shorter, perhaps reflecting the increased toxicity and poor
tolerability associated with L-AMB. Hence, polyenes used
alone or in combination with echinocandins add to the
toxicity, without offering a therapeutic advantage.
Our study has several limitations. The retrospective
design allows for selection bias; its 15-year span allows for
changes in supportive care and heterogeneity in respect to
the antifungal agents used as primary therapy. There was
overall a smaller number of salvage episodes with echinocandins alone; the contribution of IA to death was not
diagnosed by autopsy.
In conclusion, the study we conducted is among the
largest reported to date, including a patient population
with refractory IA in the setting of advanced hematological malignancy, of whom almost 50% were critically ill.
Our data suggest no additional benefit of combination
therapy versus single-agent echinocandins or L-AMB as

over others. As expected, echinocandins have demonstrated a favorable profile of adverse events. Larger, prospective studies are needed for validation.
