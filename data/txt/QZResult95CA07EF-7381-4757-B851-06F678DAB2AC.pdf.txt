ABSTRACT
Purpose: We conducted an open-label, single-arm Phase I/II clinical trial in
metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients eligible for docetaxel combined with treatment
with autologous mature dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with killed LNCaP prostate
cancer cells (DCVAC/PCa). The primary and secondary endpoints were safety and
immune responses, respectively. Overall survival (OS), followed as a part of the safety
evaluation, was compared to the predicted OS according to the Halabi and MSKCC
nomograms.
Experimental design: Twenty-five patients with progressive mCRPC were
enrolled. Treatment comprised of initial 7 days administration of metronomic
cyclophosphamide 50 mg p.o. DCVAC/PCa treatment consisted of a median twelve
doses of 1 × 107 dendritic cells per dose injected s.c. (Aldara creme was applied at
the site of injection) during a one-year period. The initial 2 doses of DCVAC/PCa
were administered at a 2-week interval, followed by the administration of docetaxel
(75 mg/m2) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily) given every 3 weeks until toxicity or
intolerance was observed. The DCVAC/PCa was then injected every 6 weeks up to
the maximum number of doses manufactured from one leukapheresis.
Results: No serious DCVAC/PCa-related adverse events have been reported.
The median OS was 19 months, whereas the predicted median OS was 11.8 months
with the Halabi nomogram and 13 months with the MSKCC nomogram. KaplanMeier analyses showed that patients had a lower risk of death compared with both
MSKCC (Hazard Ratio 0.26, 95% CI: 0.13–0.51) and Halabi (Hazard Ratio 0.33,
95% CI: 0.17–0.63) predictions. We observed a significant decrease in Tregs in the

peripheral blood. The long-term administration of DCVAC/PCa led to the induction and
maintenance of PSA specific T cells. We did not identify any immunological parameter
that significantly correlated with better OS.
Conclusions: In patients with mCRPC, the combined chemoimmunotherapy with
DCVAC/PCa and docetaxel was safe and resulted in longer than expected survival.
Concomitant chemotherapy did not preclude the induction of specific anti-tumor
cytotoxic T cells.

necessarily complete eradication tumor cells but rather the
establishment of an equilibrium between the host immune
system and the proliferating tumor cells [16]. Therefore,
new directions have focused on combination strategies
that could improve the vaccine efficacy without adding
significant toxicity.
The concept of combined chemoimmunotherapy
explores the fact that the treatment with chemotherapy
might not only decrease the tumor cell load but also
neutralize the tumor induced immunosuppression thus
facilitating the effect of concurrent immunotherapy. In
support of testing docetaxel in combination with a vaccine,
experimental data obtained in mice and humans have
contradicted the traditional thinking that taxanes suppress
immune-cell functions [17, 18]. In vitro assays have
revealed that a cohort of patients with stage II/III breast
cancer had enhanced T cell and NK cell functions when
treated with taxanes [19]. Docetaxel has also been shown to
reverse myeloid derived suppressor cell-mediated immune
suppression and to modulate the tumor microenvironment
in a manner that improves the efficacy of immune-based
therapies [20]. Moreover, patients previously vaccinated
with an anti-cancer vaccine may respond longer to
docetaxel compared with historical controls receiving
docetaxel without prior immunotherapy [21].
In this Phase I/II trial, we tested the combined
chemoimmunotherapy in patients with metastatic
castration resistant prostate cancer. In addition to the
standard chemotherapy, patients eligible for docetaxel
were treated with autologous dendritic cell based vaccine,
DCVAC/PCa. DCVAC/PCa is composed of autologous
Poly I:C activated dendritic cells pulsed with killed
LNCaP prostate cancer cell line.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently
diagnosed noncutaneous malignancy in elderly men and
is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in
Western countries [1]. Localized, early-stage disease is,
in general, successfully treated with surgery or radiation
therapy; however, approximately 30% of patients have
recurrence and require further management. Androgen
deprivation is the standard of care in such situations,
achieving temporary tumor control or regression in up to
85% of cases [2]. Although castration is quite effective,
most patients ultimately develop progressive disease,
which is poorly responsive to traditional therapies and
remains a significant clinical challenge [3]. Since 2004,
docetaxel-based regimens have become the first-line
chemotherapy in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC) patients [4–6]. Apart from taxanes,
three additional agents that directly target tumor cells
have recently been reported to increase the median OS in
mCRPC patients as well: enzalutamide, an anti-androgen
therapy [7]; abiraterone - an inhibitor of testosterone
synthesis [8]; and Alpharadin, an alpha-emitter that
targets bone metastasis [9]. However, these strategies only
modestly prolong patient survival and are linked to a wide
range of undesirable side effects [10].
Cancer immunotherapy is being tested as an
additional treatment modality in oncology [11].
Sipuleucel-T (Provenge; Dendreon Corporation), a
prostatic acid phosphatase-granulocyte/macrophagecolony-stimulating factor (PAP-GM-CSF) fusion proteinloaded autologous blood cell vaccine, was approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment
of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC [12].
Active cellular immunotherapy (ACI) using
antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) is another
immunotherapeutic approach in the clinical development
[13, 14]. Although many trials reported the induction
of antitumor immune responses after administration
of cancer immunotherapy, the efficacy has been
disappointing. The limited success of ACI in advanced
cancer patients might be due to the establishment
of tumor-induced immunosuppression [15]. In such
situation, immunotherapy alone cannot be expected
to radically reverse the progressive course of the
disease. Experimental evidence supports the fact that
the goal of the immunotherapy in the late stages is not

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient eligibility
Eligible patients had prostatic adenocarcinoma and
progression of PSA serum levels and/or radiographic
progression after the failure of second-line hormonal
manipulation in generalized, metastatic disease. Previous
chemotherapy was allowed if the last dose was at least
3 months before the study entry. Other eligibility
requirements were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status (ECOG) of 0–2, adequate
hematologic, hepatic, and renal function, and negative

criteria included a history of primary immunodeficiency,
a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction following
vaccination, the presence of pulmonary, cardiac, or other
systemic diseases limiting patient survival.

cyclophosphamide (Cyclophosphamide Orion® 50 mg
daily for 1 week) [22–24]. To increase the motility of
the injected cells and to support the accumulation of
local dendritic cells in vivo, imiquimod (Aldara® cream
12.5 mg) was applied locally 24 hours before and after
each injection. The primary endpoints were the safety and
feasibility of DCVAC/PCa active cellular immunotherapy
in mCRPC patients; the secondary endpoint was the
immune response. The study protocol was approved
by the  Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the State
Institute for Drug Control (SUKL). Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients before any study
procedures were conducted.

Study design and treatment
This report includes summary data for 25 patients,
including 15 patients from a single-institution, singlearm, open-label phase I/II clinical trial (EudraCT 2009017295-24) and 10 patients from previous patient’s named
program (approved by University Hospital Motol IRB).
These patients fulfilled the identical inclusion criteria and
were treated by the analogous schedule which was later
applied into the protocol of the clinical trial. The treatment
schedule is summarized in Fig. 1. Briefly, DCVAC/PCa
treatment consisted of a median of twelve doses of 1 × 107
dendritic cells injected s.c. at axillary and inguinal area
(2.5 ml at each site). The initial two doses of DCVAC/PCa
were administered at a 2-week interval, followed by the
administration of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and prednisone
(5 mg twice daily) given every 3 weeks until toxicity or
intolerance was observed. The vaccine was then injected
every 6 weeks up to the maximum number of doses
manufactured from one leukapheresis. Minimal interval
between chemotherapy administration and immunotherapy
was 7 days. Immune monitoring was performed before
the 1st dose of DCVAC/PCa and after the 12th dose or
after last dose if less than 12 doses were manufactured
from the leukapheresis. Before the 1st DCVAC/PCa
dose was administered, patients received metronomic

Assessment of clinical activity and toxicity
The patients were monitored at each visit by
conducting a patient history and physical examination. The
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA,
Version 15.1) was used for the coding of adverse events
(AEs). All patients underwent relevant radiologic and
laboratory tests, the Halabi and MSKCC predictions of
survival, laboratory and clinical data related to the time of
the 1st DCVAC/PCa administration were used. The real OS
was calculated from the 1st DCVAC/PCa administration
until death or until the data lock (information about all
surviving patients were available at data lock). Even
if not included in the study protocol as an endpoint, we
evaluated PSA response as a part of laboratory monitoring.
Serum PSA was measured every six weeks and a response
(for patients with a baseline PSA level of at least 20 ng per
milliliter) was defined as a reduction from baseline of at

Figure 1: Study design. The DCVAC/PCa treatment consisted of a median twelve doses of 1 × 107 dendritic cells injected s.c. The

treatment comprised an initial 7 days of metronomic cyclophosphamide administration 50 mg p.o. and 2 subsequent doses of DCVAC/PCa.
Patients then started docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily) treatment, which was administered every 3 weeks; DCVAC/
PCa was then given every 6 weeks up to the maximum number of doses manufactured from one leukapheresis. Imiquimod 5% (Aldara®
5% drm cream) was applied locally 24 hours before and after each DCVAC/PCa administration. Immunomonitoring (IM) was evaluated
after the first and twelfth doses of DCVAC/PCa. Clinical evaluation (CE) was performed after every single DCVAC/PCa dose.

Diagnostic, Mainz, Germany), respectively. Lymphocyte
subsets were enumerated by flow cytometry using FACS
CANTO II (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and were
subsequently analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star,
Ashland, OR, USA). Monoclonal antibodies against CD3,
CD4, CD8, CD16, CD19 and HLA-DR were purchased
from BD Biosciences.

DCVAC/PCa production
Generation of DCs under GMP conditions
Leukapheresis was performed using a Cobe Spectra
separator (Cobe BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA). All of
the following operations were performed under Good
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions in the GMP
facility of University Hospital Motol using the protocol
for DC generation that was approved by the State Institute
for Drug Control, as previously described [25, 26]. The
leukapheretic product was diluted in PBS + 1 mM EDTA
(Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), and mononuclear cells were
separated by Ficoll-Paque Premium (GE Healthcare,
Waukesha, WI, USA) gradient centrifugation. Collected
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were washed in PBS +
1 mM EDTA (Lonza), resuspended in CellGro medium
(CellGenix, Freiburg, Germany) and plated in triple flasks
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 1 × 106 cells
per cm2 of surface area. After 2 h, non-adherent cells were
washed with PBS (Lonza). Adherent monocytes were
cultured for 6 days in CellGro (CellGenix) medium with
20 ng/ml of IL-4 (Gentaur, Kampenhout, Belgium) and
500 U/ml of GM-CSF (Gentaur); fresh cytokines were
added on day 3. Immature DCs were harvested on day 6,
washed in PBS (Lonza) and resuspended in CellGro
(CellGenix).

Detection of regulatory T cells
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) were identified by
surface staining with anti-CD3 Alexa700 (Exbio, Vestec,
Czech Republic), CD4 PC7 (eBioscience, San Diego,
CA), CD8 PE-Dy590 (Exbio), CD25 PerCPCy5.5 and
CD127 Alexa647 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) antibodies,
followed by fixation and permeabilization with a FoxP3
staining buffer set (eBioscience) and intracellular staining
with anti-FoxP3 FITC (eBioscience), as previously
described [27, 28]. All samples were processed and
analyzed immediately after blood sampling on FACSAria™
(Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and analyzed
using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Detection of antigen-specific T cells against PSA,
MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3
For each patient, the frequency of antigen-specific
T cells against tumor antigens (PSA, MAGE-A1,
MAGE-A3) was measured by flow cytometry. Antigens
were included in the testing based on the previous
analysis of the expression of tumor associated antigens
in LNCaP cell line using real-time quantitative PCR.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
incubated for 10 days in RPMI 1640 medium (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
pooled human AB serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 2 mmol/l
L-glutamine, non-essential amino acid mix and sodium
pyruvate (all from Life Technologies), as well as with
mixtures of overlapping peptides (PepMix; JPT Peptide
Technologies, Berlin, Germany) that spanned the whole
sequence of prostate specific antigen (PSA), melanomaassociated antigen 1 (MAGE-A1) and melanoma
associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3), each at a concentration
of 1 ug/ml. On days 4 and 7, IL-2 was added (20 UI/ml;
Gentaur, Kampenhout, Belgium). On day 9, PBMCs
were restimulated for 12 hours with each peptide mixture
mentioned above, and brefeldin (BioLegend, San Diego,
CA, USA) was added after 4 hours of incubation. The
cells were first stained with antibodies against CD3PC5, CD4-PC7 (eBioscience), and CD8-PE-Dy590
(Exbio). Then, the Aqua Blue Live/Dead cell viability
assay (Life Technologies) was used to measure the
population of dead cells. Thereafter, the cells were fixed
with Fixation/Permeabilization buffer (BD Bioscience)
and permeabilized with Permeabilization buffer (BD
Bioscience). Intracellular IFN-γ staining was performed
with a FITC-conjugated antibody (BD Bioscience), and
IL-2 staining was performed with an APC-conjugated
antibody (BD Bioscience), according to the manufacturer’s

Loading of immature DCs with killed prostate cancer
cells and maturation of DCs
The PSA-positive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP
was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
and grown in UltraCULTURE (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium)
supplemented with GlutaMax (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) under GMP conditions. LNCaP cells were
detached with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Lonza), washed and
killed by UV irradiation (312 nm for 10 min). Harvested
immature DCs (day 6) were pulsed with tumor cells at a
DC:tumor cell ratio of 5:1 for 4 h. Tumor cell-pulsed DCs
were then matured with 25 μg/ml of Poly I:C (Invivogen)
overnight. Mature DCs were harvested, resuspended in
Cryostor CS10 (BioLife Solutions, Bothell, WA, USA)
and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Assessment of immunological parameters
Routine immunological testing
Serum levels of immunoglobulin G, A, and M and
C-reactive protein (in g/L) were assessed by automated
nephelometry using an Immage 800 Immunochemistry
System (Beckman Coulter). Serum autoantibodies,
ANCA, RF and anti-cardiolipin were detected using the
ANA test (BioRad, Philadelphia, PA), ANCA test (Inova
Diagnostics, San Diego, CA), and ACA test (Orgentec

instructions. Stained cells were immediately measured
using a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and
data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Tree
Star) after the exclusion of Live/Dead-positive cells. IFN-γ
secretion was only considered to be antigen specific if
the frequency of IFN-γ-secreting T cells that responded
to peptide-pulsed PBMCs was at least 2 times greater
than the frequency of IFN-γ secretion in response to the
negative control (unpulsed PBMCs).
Detection of tumor antigen-specific
against PSA and MAGE-A3

Survival analysis was performed using the R-package
‘survival.’ The log-rank test was used to compare the
survival of treated patients to their expected survival
using the Halabi [29] or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC) nomograms [30]. Cox proportional
hazards models were used to assess univariate and
multivariate associations between clinical variables
and prognosis. Variables that were significantly associated
with prognosis in the univariate analysis were further
included in the multivariate analysis.

RESULTS

The recombinant proteins PSA and MAGE-3
(Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan) were diluted in Carbonate
Coating Buffer (Life Technologies) to a final concentration
of 1 μg/ml and were adhered to 96-well plates overnight
at 4°C. The plates were blocked for 1 hour with Assay
Buffer (Life Technologies), and then human sera diluted
to 1:50, 1:100 and 1:200 were incubated in the antigencoated wells for 2 h. The plates were then incubated with
secondary antibody (goat polyclonal antibody to human
IgG; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 hour. TMB substrate
(Life Technologies) was then added and incubated for
20 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding Stop
Solution (Invitrogen, Prague, Czech Republic), and the
plates were immediately read at an absorbance of 450 nm.
As a positive control, cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B was
used. The cutoff value designating a positive reaction was
assessed as the mean OD of 15 healthy control human sera
(NHS) + 3SD.

Characteristics of the patients
Between August 2008 and March 2014, twenty-five
patients were treated with DCVAC/PCa. The median age at
the start of immunotherapy was 73 years (age range 48–82
years), 88% of the patients had tumors with Gleason score
≥ 7 and none of them had signs of visceral disease. The
median entry levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) were
186 ng/mL (range 1–749 ng/mL), of lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) were 234 IU/L (range 129–399 IU/L), of alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) were 192 IU/L (range 37–1843 IU/L),
of hemoglobin (Hgb) were 11.9 g/dL (range 9–14.8 g/
dL) and of C-reactive protein (CRP) were 5.6 mg/L.
All patients had experienced progression on androgen
deprivation therapy as an initial or secondary treatment.
Testosterone levels were maintained at castrate levels
during the study. Eight patients had received docetaxelbased chemotherapy prior to the enrollment (> 3 months
before entering the study), with a median of 8 months
long chemotherapy free period. During the study period,
approximately 350 doses of ACI were administered, with
a median of 12 doses per patient. After chemotherapy
failure, the patients were treated with supportive care.
None received abiraterone, enzalutamide or alpharadin.
The patients’ baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.

Statistical analysis
Group comparisons were performed using the
GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad software, La Jolla,
CA). The effect of the treatment on immune parameters
was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Clinical efficacy

Immunological response

PSA response

To evaluate the effect of DCVAC/PCa on the
immune system, PBMCs were isolated pre and post
vaccination and subsequently analyzed for T cell subsets.
We observed no significant changes in the frequency or
absolute numbers of peripheral blood CD3+, CD4+ and NK
cells during the course of the trial (Fig. S1). Conversely,
the frequency of activated CD3+/HLA-DR+ cells and CD8+
T cells significantly increased (*p > 0.05) (Fig. 3A, 3B).
Additionally, a significant decrease in the frequency of
regulatory T cells was observed (*p = 0.0402) (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, after the course of treatment, the levels of
IgG and IgM were significantly decreased (Supplemental
Fig. 2A, 2B). There was no significant trend in the
occurrence of autoantibodies (data not shown).
We also assessed the presence of antigen-specific
T cells and antibody response against prostate-specific tumor
antigens. The peripheral blood of the patients was stimulated
by peptide mixes (PSA, MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3), and the
frequency of IFN-γ-secreting T cells was analyzed by flow
cytometry. Eleven out of 23 patients had significantly higher
numbers of antigen-specific T  cells against PSA before
treatment compared with healthy controls (data not shown).

In patients with PSA response assessed, reduction
by at least 50% on two visits at least 6 weeks apart was
observed in 9 of 23 patients (39, 1%) (8/9 were chemonaive). At 6 months (6th dose of DCVAC/PCa) after the
initiation of chemo/immunotherapy, a ≥ 50% decrease
in  PSA was observed in 8 of 23 patients (34, 8%) and
25–50% decrease of PSA in additional 5 patients (21, 7%).
Overall survival
Overall survival, followed as a part of the safety
evaluation, was compared to the predicted values calculated
by the Halabi and MSKCC nomograms. Fig. 2A shows
Kaplan-Meier estimation of the survival distributions. The
estimated median survival for the DCVAC/PCa-treated
group was 19 months compared to 11.8 months in the
Halabi and 13 months in the MSKCC control predictions.
Log-rank tests showed that patients had a significantly
better observed survival than that of the MSKCC (*p =

Similar results were obtained for MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3
antigen-specific T cells, for which 6 out of 23 and 3 out of
23 patients had significantly increased numbers of antigenspecific T cells compared with the healthy controls (data not
shown). Long-term administration of DCVAC/PCa induced
a statistically significant increase in the PSA-specific T cells
PSA (*p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). However, we did not observe
significant changes in the frequency of antigen-specific
T cells against MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3 antigens during
the course of the trial (Fig. 4B, 4C).
Furthermore, we evaluated the induction of
tumor antigen-reactive IgG antibodies by DCVAC/PCa
vaccination. The presence of IgG antibodies against PSA
and MAGE-3 was analyzed in patient sera. We detected

IgG-positive antibodies against PSA in 6 out of 23 (26%)
patients (Supplemental Fig. 2C) and against MAGE-A3 in
8 out of 23 (34%) patients (Supplemental Fig. 2D). There
was no obvious correlation between the presence of PSA
or MAGE-A3 specific antibodies and frequency of tumor
antigen specific T cells (Supplemental Fig. 3A, 3B). We
did not observe any significant correlation between the OS
and the presence of antibody or cellular immunity against
tumor antigens (Supplemental Fig. 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 3G).

disease progression or death. First, univariate analysis
was performed to evaluate the impact of 24 biological
parameters measured at the beginning of the treatment
(Table 3). Among those, C-reactive protein (CRP) was
associated with a poor outcome after treatment (Hazard
Ratio: 1.01), whereas ECOG and hemoglobin (Hgb)
were associated with a favorable outcome after treatment
(Hazard Ratio: 0.89 and 0.64, respectively). No other
parameters reached significance. Multivariate analysis
indicated that Hgb (Hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48–0.95)
was the only independent prognostic factor associated
with a positive outcome of treated patients, although
the performance status of ECOG was close to being
significantly associated with a good prognosis (Hazard
ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.99–7.1, p-value 0.052). None of
the routine immunological parameters evaluated before
treatment had any impact on the overall survival of
vaccinated subjects.

for testing cancer immunotherapy would be to design
trials in early stages of the disease, with minimal burden
of tumor cells [35, 36]. It is, however, very challenging
to define studies in early stage patients with efficacy
indicating endpoints that could be reached in a realistic
timeframe. Current regulatory environment pushes for the
improved overall survival as the most relevant indicator of
a clinical benefit. Cancer immunotherapy approaches thus
need to be tested in late stage patients, often pretreated
or treated by chemotherapy with large tumor burden
and metastatic disease. It’s very challenging to induce
anti-tumor responses in late stages in the settings of a
profound tumor induced immunosuppression. Possible
strategy how to circumvent these practical concerns
might be the appropriate combination of tumor mass
reduction by surgery or chemo/radiotherapy along with the
neutralization of tumor-induced immunosuppression [17].
This might establish the proper conditions for the
induction of an anti-tumor immune response by active
immunotherapy.
Recent studies indicate that despite the common
view of chemotherapy and immunotherapy as antagonistic,
there are synergies between the two approaches. For
example, certain chemotherapeutics were described to
induce immunogenic cell death [37–40]. Chemotherapy
can also reduce tumor induced immunosuppression by
eliminating suppressive populations of immune cells,
such as Tregs or myeloid derived suppressor cells [37].
Immunotherapy has been reported to sensitize tumor cells
to subsequent chemotherapy in various models, including
small cell lung cancer or glioblastoma [41] [42].
With respect to the concept of combined
chemoimmunotherapy, we performed an open-label,
single-arm clinical trial in patients with metastatic,
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) eligible
for first- or second-line docetaxel treatment using
DCVAC/PCa. We did not see any serious anaphylactic
reactions or any evidence of autoimmunity in treated

DISCUSSION
Prostate cancer represents a relevant candidate
disease for the development of cancer immunotherapy
strategies. Prostate cancer cells express tissue-specific
proteins that could act as therapeutic targets, among
others PSA, PAP, PSMA and prostate cancer usually
progresses at relatively slow pace, which might allow
for the elicitation of an effective immune response [31].
DC-based vaccination strategies have shown promising
results in the past; however, the limitations observed in
late-stage cancer patients led to the idea that combination
strategies might improve the efficacy and long-term
effects of immunotherapy [32, 33]. Experimental evidence
supports the fact that the goal of immunotherapy in
advanced-stage cancer does not have to be the complete
eradication of tumor cells but rather the reversal from the
escape phase back to the equilibrium stage as predicted by
the cancer immunoediting model [34]. A plausible strategy

reports, showing a favourable safety profile of DCbased approaches [32]. Moreover, no additional toxicity
of combining chemotherapy with vaccination has been
observed. Importantly, patients receiving combined
treatment with standard docetaxel chemotherapy and
DCVAC/PCa survived significantly longer than predicted
by standard Halabi and MSKCC nomograms. With a
median follow-up of 19 months, combined docetaxel and
DCVAC/PCa resulted in a 7.2- and 6-month improvement
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the median overall survival compared with that of the
Halabi or MSKCC nomogram, respectively. The effect
of on survival was consistently observed across patient
subgroups, including those with prognostic factors known
to be adversely correlated with overall survival such as
increased prostate specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase
and lactate dehydrogenase levels, the Gleason score,
the presence of pain, and an increased number of bone
metastases. Our results showed that factors reflecting
satisfactory clinical condition of the treated patients (good
18202

Oncotarget

performance status, low CRP levels, higher Hgb levels)
were associated with longer overall survival. None of
the assessed routine immunological parameters had an
important predictive value for the outcome of the therapy.
This is in contrast with the data published by Sheikh
N et al [12].
In a pivotal clinical trial with docetaxel (5), rates
of PSA response were detected in 45% of docetaxel
treated patients. In this study, we detected PSA response
in 39, 1% patients. However, 9 patients in our study were
advanced patients who previously failed on docetaxel
before the study entry. When restricting the analysis of the
PSA response to chemo-naive patients, the PSA response
was detected in 60%. This suggests that combined chemoimmunotherapy might lead to the PSA response in higher
proportion of patients than docetaxel alone. This, however,
needs to be analyzed in larger randomized trials.
Immune responses were evaluated as a secondary
endpoint in our study. We evaluated antigen-specific
CD8+ T cell responses by intracellular staining for IFN-γ
following stimulation with tumor antigens and antibody
responses by measuring tumor antigen specific IgGs. We
detected a significant increase in the frequency of PSAspecific CD8+ T cells, with no increase in the number
of antigen-specific T cells against MAGE-A1 and
MAGE-A3. The total number of activated CD3+HLADR+
T cells, as well as of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, was
significantly increased after the treatment cycle.
In accordance with previously published reports,
we detected lower levels of total IgG and IgM in the sera
after the treatment. The decline is most probably linked
to the chemotherapy treatment [43]. In 6 and 8 patients’
sera, we detected the presence of IgG antibodies against
PSA and MAGE-A3, respectively. There was no direct
correlation between patients with antigen-specific T cells
and positive antibodies against the respective tumor
antigen. We did not see any correlation between the
presence of anti-tumor immune response and survival,
although this analysis is preliminary given the small
number of patients. It’s also important to note that although
easily accessible, peripheral blood might not represent the
most relevant compartment for the analysis of anti-tumor
immunity. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment might
provide more pertinent information.
Prostate cancer patients were reported to have
increased numbers of circulating and tumor-infiltrating
Tregs, and there is evidence that Tregs promote tumor
growth in vivo [44]. We detected significantly lower
frequency of Tregs after chemo-immunotherapy.
Taken together, it’s hard to dissect which changes
in immune parameters are attributable to chemoimmunotherapy and which are caused by the disease
progression. We conclude that chemotherapy does not
preclude the induction and long term maintenance of
PSA-specific T cells and that DCVAC/PCa does not
induce detectable autoimmunity. The observed changes in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

immune parameters (reduction of Tregs, increase in CD8+
T cells, HLA DR+CD3+ cells and PSA-specific CD8+ cells)
fit into the concept that successful cancer immunotherapy
should not increase the percentage of regulatory T cells
and should lead to the establishment of a long-term tumor
cell-specific immunity [45].
Combined chemoimmunotherapy by docetaxel and
DCVAC/PCa was well tolerated and led to an improved
overall survival of mCRPC patients compared with
the predicted survival using the nomograms [29, 30].
Better than predicted survival, favorable safety profile,
augmentation of the antigen-specific immune responses
and decrease in Treg numbers provide rationale for
conducting larger randomized studies, including placebocontrol group, to evaluate the clinical efficacy of this
treatment strategy.
