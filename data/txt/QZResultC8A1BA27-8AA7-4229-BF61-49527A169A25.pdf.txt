ABSTRACT:
EZH2, a core member of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), mediates
transcriptional silencing by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone 3 lysine
27 (H3K27), which plays key roles in cancer initiation and progression. Here,
we investigated the expression pattern and biological roles of EZH2 in tongue
tumorigenesis by loss-of-function assays using small interference RNA and EZH2
inhibitor DZNep. Also we determined the therapeutic efficiency of DZNep against
tongue cancer in vivo. We found that aberrantly overexpressed EZH2 was associated
with pathological grade, cervical nodes metastasis and Ki-67 expression in tongue
cancers. Elevated EZH2 correlated with shorter overall survival and showed significant
and independent prognostic importance in patients with tongue cancer. Both genetic
and pharmacological depletion of EZH2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion
and colony formation and decreased CD44+ subpopulation probably in part through
modulating p16, p21 and E-caherin. Moreover, DZNep enhanced the anticancer effects
of 5-Fluorouracil. Furthermore, intratumoral EZH2 inhibition induced by DZNep
intraperitoneal administration significantly attenuated tumor growth in a tongue
cancer xenograft model. Taken together, our results indicate that EZH2 serves as a
key driver with multiple oncogenic functions during tongue tumorigenesis and a new
biomarker for tongue cancer diagnosis and prognostic prediction. These findings open
up possibilities for therapeutic intervention against EZH2 in tongue cancer.

INTRODUCTION

chemotherapy and radiotherapy over the past decades,
the 5-year survival rate of oral SCC has not increased too
much. Local relapse and cervical lymph node metastasis
are the most prevalent factor affecting patientsâ€™ survival
[3]. Notably, some small or early oral carcinoma lesions
may have occult nodal metastasis and behave aggressively
at their initial stages. Many patients are diagnosed at an
advanced stage in their initial clinical visits and died
without successful treatments. Although many oncogenes
and tumor suppressors have been identified as key players
underlying oral tumorigenesis, however, no optimal and
commonly-accepted biomarkers have been established

Oral cancer is the sixth most common cancers
worldwide with more than 70% of cases occurring in
developing countries, accounting for approximately 3%
of all malignancies in both sexes [1]. The major risks for
this malignancy include human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection, smoking and heavy alcohol consumption [2].
The overweighing majority of oral cancer is diagnosed
as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and mostly arises
from tongue. Despite tremendous advancement in
multimodal therapies for oral cancer including surgery,

to facilitate the comprehensive management of patients,
for example timely diagnosis, treatment selection and
prognostic prediction [4]. These facts underscore the
aggressive nature of oral cancer and therapeutic challenge
for clinicians. Therefore, the identifications of the new
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for oral SCC especially
the tongue SCC (TSCC) are paramount and urgent to
optimize diagnosis and treatment strategies for this lethal
disease.
The enhancer of zest homolog (EZH2) is a core
catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex
2 (PRC2), which epigenetically regulates genes by
specifically trimethylating nucleosomal histone H3 at
lysine 27(H3K27me3) [5]. Gene silencing mediated by
EZH2-induced H3K27me3 has been involved in diverse
fundamental cellular processes, such as cell fate decision,
cell cycle progression, apoptosis and senescence, stem
cell maintenance and cancer development [6]. Previous
reports have established that EZH2 is aberrantly
overexpressed in a wide range of cancer types including
breast, prostate, lung cancer and so forth [7-9]. EZH2
overexpression often correlated with advanced stages
and poor prognosis in these cancers. Enforced expression
of EZH2 increased cancer cell proliferation, epithelialmesenchymal transition, metastatic spreading and other
oncogenic properties, whereas its depletion inhibited
cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced
cell apoptosis and senescence both in vitro and in vivo
[10-12]. Furthermore, accumulated evidence indicates
that a myriad of direct or indirect target genes including
E-cadherin, INK-ARP(p14,p16) are partially responsible
for the essential roles of EZH2 in various cancers [13, 14].
These findings have established that EZH2 functions as an
important oncogenic biomarker for cancer initiation and
progression, thus leading to the hypothesis that blocking
EZH2 expression/activity and its downstream signaling
cascade may represent a promising strategy for novel
anticancer treatment. Indeed, several reports have shown
that genetic silencing and pharmacologic inhibition of
EZH2 induced cell apoptosis, inhibited cell invasion and
tumor angiogenesis, ultimately suppressed cancer growth
and progression [15, 16]. More importantly, given the
advantages of specific chemical compounds including
convenient to use and reversible nature of epigenetic
modifications behind carcinogenesis, administration of
small molecules targeting EZH2 seems to be a plausible
and appealing way as a novel anti-cancer strategy [17].
3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) is the cyclopentanyl
analog of 3-deazaadenosine that potently inhibits the
activity of S-adenosylhomocyteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase,
resulting in cellular accumulation of AdoHcy which in
turn represses the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent
histone lysine methyltransferase activities [18]. Several
lines of evidence indicates that DZNep appears to be a
unique chromatin-remodeling compound that induces

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

degradation of cellular PRC2 proteins including EZH2 and
concomitant removal of H3K27me3 mark, and reactivates
the epigenetically silenced targets [19]. Disruption
of EZH2 by DZNep induced apoptosis, inhibited cell
invasion and enhanced chemotherapeutic sensitivity, but
not normal and untransformed cells at tumor-inhibiting
doses [20]. Moreover, DZNep-induced inhibition of EZH2
dramatically diminished the number and self-renewal
capacity of cancer cells with tumor-initiating properties
and significantly decreased tumor xenograft growth and
improved survival [21, 22]. These findings suggested
DZNep may be a promising therapeutic agent for cancer
treatment through multiple characterized and unknown
mechanisms.
Accumulating evidence has indicated that EZH2
serves as an essential oncogenic driver during the initiation
and progression of head neck cancers. Overexpression of
EZH2 significantly correlated with tumor size, cervical
lymph node metastasis, clinical stage and poor prognosis,
and served as an independent prognostic indicator for
patients with head neck cancer [23-25]. However, the indepth investigations into the expression pattern of EZH2
and associated molecular mechanisms underlying TSCC
development has been in infancy and remains to be further
clarified. Additionally, the therapeutic efficiency of EZH2targeting compounds like DZNep as a new option for
TSCC treatment remains largely unknown. Therefore, in
the present study, we first examined the EZH2 expression
and its clinicopathological significance in tongue cancer
cell lines and clinical samples. Then the biological roles
responsible for EZH2 in tongue cancer progression
were identified using both pharmacological and siRNAmediated genetic approaches. Moreover, treatment
efficiency of DZNep against tongue cancer was further
assessed in the xenograft mouse model.

RESULTS
EZH2 is overexpressed in TSCC cell lines and
clinical specimens
To explore the EZH2 expression in TSCC, we first
evaluated both mRNA and protein levels of EZH2 in a
panel of TSCC cell lines as compared with normal tongue
mucosa. As shown in Fig 1A, EZH2 mRNA levels in
all cancerous cells were significantly higher than that in
normal mucosa as assessed by real-time RT-PCR assay.
The amounts of EZH2 mRNA in Cal27, Tca8113, SCC9
and SCC25 were elevated approximately 7.42, 6.01, 4.27
and 4.18 folds (P<0.01), respectively. The following
results derived from western blotting experiments further
confirmed the upregulated EZH2 expression in all
TSCC cells lines (Fig 1B). The protein levels of EZH2

in Tca8113, Cal27, SCC9 and SCC25 were dramatically
increased (P<0.01) when compared with normal tongue
mucosa. In addition, H3K27me3 as the primary marker
for EZH2 enzyme activity was also quantified in these cell
lines. As expected, the expression levels of H3K27me3
in the tongue cancer cell lines was markedly upregulated
relative to normal mucosa (Fig.1B).
To further examine EZH2 expression in clinical
specimens, we next compared its abundance among
three pairs of tongue cancer and adjacent nontumorigenic tissue. As indicated in Fig.1C, EZH2
protein was remarkably upregulated in tongue cancers
as compared to adjacent non-tumorigenic tissue. Then,
the expression level of EZH2 was further evaluated by
immunohistochemical staining in a retrospective cohort
of 84 samples from primary TSCC patients. In accordance
with our immunohistochemistry scoring method, EZH2
expression in TSCC and normal tongue mucosa was
shown in Table 1. EZH2 levels in all specimens derived
from TSCC patients were graded as low (30) or high
expression group (54), while its expression levels

in normal counterparts were divided into negative
(4), low (10) group and high (2), indicating aberrant
overexpression of EZH2 in a fraction of TSCC samples
(P<0.01). A representative labeling of EZH2 in TSCC and
normal tongue mucosa was shown in Fig.1E. In cancer
cells, high EZH2 expression was readily identified mainly
in nucleus but rarely in cytoplasm. To further characterize
the subcellular distribution of EZH2 in tongue cancer,
cellular immunofluorescence was performed in tongue
cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig.1D, EZH2 was readily
detected and identified in nucleus in cancer cell lines
examined. Collectively, these data indicate that EZH2 is
aberrantly overexpressed in a significant fraction of tongue
cancers.

Overexpression of EZH2 is associated with
pathological grade, cervical nodes metastasis and
Ki-67 expression and poor prognosis of TSCC
To further understand the significance of EZH2
overexpression in tongue cancers, we set out to identify

the potential associations between EZH2 expression
and patientsâ€™ clinicopathological features. Several
clinicopathological features (age, gender, pathological
grade, tumor size, clinical stage, cervical node status, local
invasion) of these patients were summarized in Table 2.
In brief, 46 male and 38 female patients were enrolled
with mean age 56.1 years (26-76 years). The follow-up
period ranged from 2 months to 101 months with average
40.2 months. The detailed relationships between EZH2
expression status and clinicopathological variables of 84
patients were shown in Table 2. There were no significant
correlations between EZH2 expression with patientsâ€™
age, gender, tumor size, local invasion and clinical stage.
Noticeably, significant associations between EZH2
abundance with pathological grade and cervical nodes
metastasis were found with P-values 0.0027 and 0.0059,
respectively.
Given the facts that Ki-67 is a well-established
biomarker for cancer cell proliferation and EZH2 has
putative proproliferative role during cancer progression,
we then ask whether the positive correlation between
EZH2 and Ki-67 existed in TSCC. Ki-67 expression was
determined by immunohistochemical staining as EZH2 in
the same TSCC specimens. Indeed, as shown in Table 3,
EZH2 expression was found to be significantly associated
with Ki-67 (P =0.0215) in these patients analyzed.
To determine relationship between EZH2 expression
and TSCC patientsâ€™ prognosis, we attempted to evaluate
the correlation between EZH2 expression and clinical
outcomes. At the time of the last follow-up, 39 of 72
(54.2%) patients were alive and disease-free, 9 (12.5%)
patients with recurrence and/or cervical nodal metastases,
24 (33.3%) patients died due to local recurrence,
metastases or other unrelated diseases. In a KaplanMeier survival analysis, as shown in Fig.1F, high EZH2
expression in TSCC was significantly associated with
short overall survival (Log-rank, P=0.0224), suggesting
that EZH2 overexpression associated with an adverse
prognostic outcomes.
To further assess whether EZH2 expression can be
identified as a prognostic predictor for TSCC patients,
the univariate and multivariate survival analyses (Cox
proportional hazards regression model) were performed. In
the univariate survival analysis, cervical nodal metastasis
and EZH2 expression significantly associated with overall
survival (P=0.007, 0.022, respectively), whereas other
clinicopathological variables including Ki-67 expression
didnâ€™t reach the statistical significance as indicated in
Table 4. To rule out confounding factors, multivariate
survival analysis was carried out including the relevant
covariates. In this Cox regression model, EZH2 expression
status was found to be an independent prognostic marker
for the overall survival of TSCC patients (P=0.047),
together with cervical nodal metastasis (P=0.014).

DZNep treatment inhibits EZH2 through
proteosome-mediated protein degradation

concentrations of DZNep(1, 2.5, 5ÂµM) for varying time
courses and then subjected to western blotting assay. As
shown in Fig. 2A, DZNep induced a time-dependent and
dose-dependent decrease of EZH2 in these two cell lines.
The most significant inhibitions were observed when cells
were treated with 5 ÂµM DZNep and for 72h. As H3K27 trimethylation is mainly catalyzed by EZH2 and associated
with the PRC2-mediated epigenetic repression in cancer,
we then monitored the changes of H3K27 expression after
cells treated with DZNep. As expected, the abundance of
H3K27me3 was pronouncedly downregulated following
DZNep incubation (Fig.2B).

Previous reports have indicate that DZNep
potently depleted the core proteins of Polycomb complex
including EZH2 and robustly triggered anti-cancer
therapeutic effects in several cancer cells[19, 20]. To
determine whether the inhibitory effects of DZNep on
EZH2 expression exist in tongue cancer cells, we first
measured the EZH2 abundance change following various
concentrations and time courses of DZNep treatment.
Cal27 and Tca8113 were incubated with various

To investigate whether EZH2 reduction by DZNep
is due to transcriptional repression, EZH2 mRNA
abundance before and after DZNep treatment was
compared via real-time RT-PCR. However, EZH2 mRNA
remained almost unchanged following DZNep exposure
(Fig.2C), suggesting that DZNep might decrease EZH2
via a post-transcriptional way. A line of evidence has
indicated the components of PRC2 complex including
EZH2 are subjected to proteosome-mediated degradation
[20]. Therefore, Cal27 cells were treated with DZNep
alone or in combination with proteosome inhibitor MG132
for 24h. Our results indicated that addition of MG132
partially prevented the reduction of EZH2 induced by
DZNep (Fig.2D), implying that DZNep inhibited EZH2
probably through increased protein degradation rather than
transcriptional repression.

at 24h. Following DZNep treatment (5ÂµM) for 72h, the
proportions of cells in G1 phase in Cal27 and Tca8113
were approximately 62.1% and 56.3% respectively,
which were much higher than that in cells treated with
DMSO (38.6% and 40.2%, P<0.01). Accordingly,
the populations of cells in S phase and M phase were
significantly decreased upon DNZep exposure in both cell
lines. Then, we asked whether these cell-cycle regulators
were responsible for DZNep-induced G1 arrest and
reduced cell proliferation. Previous studies have indicated
that the key cell cycle regulators including p16 and p21
were putative downstream effectors of EZH2 and can be
induced in cancer cells [14, 26]. In agreement with these
previous studies, our data showed that both p16 and p21
were strongly induced and exhibited remarkable increase
following DZNep addition (Fig.3E). Together, these
data indicate that DZNep inhibits cell proliferation with
robustness at least in part through inducing G1 cell cycle
arrest via p16 and p21 upregulation in tongue cancer cells.
The results from cell apoptotic assay indicated a
remarkable increase of cell apoptosis in the presence of
DZNep. The proportions of apoptotic cells increased from
2.12 to 4.25 % in Cal27 and 1.94% to 9.85% in Tca8113,
respectively (Fig.3B). Increased abundance of active
cleaved caspase-3 protein further confirmed the apoptosis
triggered by DZNep in tongue cancer cells (Fig.3E).
Using wound healing assay and Matrigel invasion

DZNep inhibits cell growth and migration and
invasion, while induces cell apoptosis in tongue

We next set out to clarify the effects of DZNep on
cell phenotype and properties in tongue cancer cells. As
shown in Fig.3A, DZNep incubation significantly decrease
the cell viability at 48h in Cal27 and Tca8113 cell lines,
although the inhibitory effects were not much obvious

assay, the migratory and invasive properties of tongue
cancer cells were determined when treated with DZNep.
Our results showed that the migration and invasion
were both significantly reduced upon DZNep exposure
(Fig.3C-D and data not shown for Tca8113). Since
E-cadherin has been well established as a master regulator
in cancer invasion and metastasis and a key downstream
target of EZH2, we then wonder whether E-cadherin
induction was responsible for the impaired migration
and invasion induced by DZNep. As shown in Fig.3E,
DZNep treatment resulted in a pronounced upregulation
of E-cadherin protein together with a remarkable decrease
of Vimentin in both tongue cancer cells. Taken together,
these results suggest that DZNep inhibits cell migration
and invasion probably through upregulation of E-cadherin
and downregulation of Vimentin.

DZNep affects the cancer stem cell-like properties in
tongue cancer. Firstly, the colony-forming assay was
performed to evaluate the effects of DZNep on the
colony-forming efficiency which is a surrogate readout
of stem cell abundance. The results clearly indicated
that the number of colony was much fewer in cells after
DZNep treatment than that in cells without DZNep.
In addition, the size of colony was also smaller in cells
following DZNep treatment (Fig.4A). Then we further
sought to measure the fraction of CD44-positive cell
population which contained putative cancer stem cells
in head neck cancer by fluorescent-activated cell sorting.
Notably, the percentage of CD44-positive cell fraction in
Cal27 decreased significantly from 60.2% to 30.3% after
DZNep treatment as shown in Fig 4C. The similar results
were also observed in Tca8113 cells (data not shown). To
further confirm the inhibitory effects conferred by DZNep
on putative cancer stem cell subpopulation in tongue
cancer, the expression levels of several key cell surface
makers for cancer stem cell characterization including
CD44, CD133 and ALDH1 were compared in the presence
or absence of DZNep. Our real-time RT-PCR results
indicated that mRNAs of these three makers displayed

cell homeostasis and regulation, we then ask whether

senescence together with remarkable induction of p16 and
p21 (Fig.3E). Collectively, these findings suggest that
DZNep triggers cell senescence by activations of both
p16/Rb and p53/p21 signaling in tongue cancer cells.
Previous reports have offered some clues that
aberrantly overexpression of EZH2 is associated
with chemoresistance and its depletion enhanced
chemosensitivity in multiple cancers [29]. Here, we
asked whether DZNep can enhance anti-tumor activities
with the commonly used anticancer drug 5-FU in vitro.
Not surprisingly, cell proliferation and viability were
significantly impaired when cells were treated with DZNep
or 5-FU alone as measured by MTT assay. However, cell
viability was more significantly reduced in cells treated
with both DZNep and 5-FU in comparison to DZNep
or 5-FU alone (Fig.5A, C). Furthermore, the percentage
of apoptotic cells was much higher in cells with DZNep
and 5-FU incubation than that in cells with single drug
incubation as evidenced by flow cytometry (Fig.5B, D).
Together, these findings indicate that DZNep has capacity
to enhance anti-tumor functions of 5-FU by reducing cell
viability and inducing cell apoptosis in tongue cancer
cells.

DZNep induces cell senescence and enhanced
5-FU chemosensititvity in tongue cancer cells
Cellular senescence is one of the common and
critical anti-tumor mechanisms underlying cancer therapy
and also one aspect of the key biological functions of
PRC2 complex [27]. We next sought to clarify whether
DZNep was capable to induce cellular senescence in
tongue cancer cells. As shown in Fig.5A, DZNep treatment
significantly induced cell senescence as evidenced by
increased SA-Î²-gal staining positive cells. Compared with
vehicle control (less than 2%), the percentage of SA-Î²gal positive cells increased to 14.6% and 8.5% in Tca8113
and Cal27, respectively. Senescent cells undergo growth
arrest mediated by two principal pathways including p16/
Rb and p53/p21 signaling cascades [28]. After incubation

in Fig.6C-K, our results indicated that siRNA-mediated
EZH2 depletion resulted in impaired cell proliferation,
reduced migration and invasion, triggered more apoptotic
and senescence cells, less CD44-positive cells and
enhanced 5-FU chemosensitivity, largely resembling the
results derived from DZNep treatment in vitro. Taken
together, these findings strongly suggest that the EZH2
serves as a potent oncogenic regulator involving multiple
properties of tongue cancer cells and DZNep executes its
anticancer functions, at least in part by its pharmacological
inhibition of EZH2 in tongue cancer cells.

intraperitoneal injection once every three days. Following
the first drug injection, tumor masses volumes were
monitored and calculated. As shown in Fig.7C, although
the tumor growth did not display completely inhibition
or recession in mice receiving DZNep, the mean tumor
volumes were much smaller in mice treated with DZNep
as compared with the mice treated with vehicle only at
multiple time points. The final weight of tumor masses
were also significantly less in DZNep-treated mice
than that in vehicle-treated mice (Fig.7C). During the
whole animal experiment, DZNep were well tolerated
by mice without obvious abnormalities of behavior,
feeding and weight loss during the experiment. We next
examined the expression levels of Ki-67 and cleave
caspase-3 as makers of cell proliferation and apoptosis
by immunohistochemistry in the tumor samples. The
immunohistochemical staining showed that in comparison
to the control mice, the percentage of Ki-67 positive
cancer cells was strongly reduced, whereas the percentage
of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells was significantly
increased in mice administered DZNep (Fig.7D).
To establish the existence of DZNep-induced EZH2
inhibition in vivo, EZH2, H3K27me3 and other potential
downstream effectors of interest were further examined in

the tumor samples. As indicated in Fig.7E, intratumoral
EZH2 and associated H3K27me3 were significantly
inhibited after DZNep administration, while several
downstream effectors which were normally epigenetically
silenced displayed increase with various degrees. Taken
together, our findings indicate that intraperitoneallyadministrated DZNep effectively exerted its in vivo
therapeutic functions probably by inhibition of EZH2 and
derepression of EZH2-mediated epigenetic silencing.

cancer progression by loss-of-function assays via both
pharmacological and genetic approaches. DZNep has
been widely employed to investigate the functions of
EZH2 in diverse biological contexts including cancer,
largely due to its potency to inhibit the endogenous EZH2
and associated trimethylation of H3K27 in multiple
types of cells [20, 21]. Here, our findings indicated that
DZNep reduced EZH2 protein abundance in a timedependent and dose-dependent manner and repressed
the H3K27 trimethylation simultaneously. With regard to
the potential mechanism behind EZH2 depletion induced
by DZNep, our experiments further showed that DZNep
exposure induced dramatic reduction of EZH2 probably
through protein degradation as evidenced by the facts that
there was little change of EZH2 mRNA in the presence
of DZNep and remarkable loss of inhibitory effect of
DZNep on EZH2 protein in the cotreatment with DZNep
and the proteosome inhibitor. These findings have been
also supported by previous reports that DZNep triggered
the reduction of EZH2 in breast, colorectal and skin
cancer cells through increased protein degradation, rather
than as a result of transcriptional mechanisms [20, 34].
Furthermore, our findings indicated that DZNep induced
not only EZH2 reduction and removal of accompanied
H3K27 trimethylation, but also reactivated several
known downstream targets including p16 and E-cadherin.
Collectively, these results indicate that DZNep is a robust
chemical inhibitor against EZH2 through triggering
proteosome-mediated protein degradation and has capacity
to modulate EZH2-mediated downstream signaling
cascade in tongue cancer cell. These findings also suggest
that DZNep might be a potent and versatile blocker of
EZH2 for cancer therapy irrespective of cancer origin.
Accumulated evidence has established that
EZH2 plays pleiotropic tumorigenic roles in cancer
progression by regulating a myriad of target genes in
multiple cancers [35]. Our loss-of-function studies in
vitro indicated that deregulated EZH2 and its associated
pathways were involved in diverse aspects of oncogenic
phenotype of tongue cancer cells. Previous reports
have indicated that EZH2 is identified as a downstream
mediator of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathwayE2F pathway which controls multiple key cell-cycle
regulators during cell proliferation in normal and cancer
cells [36]. Additionally, EZH2 represses the p16, p19
and p15 directly or indirectly which activates the Cyclin
D-CDK4/6 complex and promotes progression through
G1 phase and cell proliferation [14, 37]. Consistent with
these results, our data showed remarkable inhibition of
cell proliferation, G1 cell cycle arrest and accompanying
upregulation of two key cell-cycle regulators p16 and
p21 after EZH2 depletion. Moreover, the closely positive
association between EZH2 and Ki-67 expression in
clinical samples, reduced Ki-67 staining and tumor
growth following EZH2 inhibition in the xenograft
model further supported the notion that EZH2 promoted

DISCUSSION
Aberrant epigenetic alternations including histone
modifications are one of the key hallmarks of human
cancer. Many tumor suppressors are epigenetically
silenced in this way during cancer development. However,
such epigenetic changes are reversible which underscores
the possibility that such epigenetic modifications may
be ideal targets for cancer therapeutic intervention [30].
In the present study, we provide evidence that EZH2,
the key catalysis enzyme for H3K27me3, is abnormally
overexpressed in a large fraction of tongue cancers.
Its overexpression associates with several aggressive
characteristics and serves as an independent prognostic
factor for patients with tongue cancer. Moreover, using
both pharmacological and genetic approaches, the multiple
oncogenic roles of EZH2 and potential underlying
mechanisms during tongue progression were identified.
Furthermore, the therapeutic efficiency of DZNep against
tongue cancer was confirmed in the tongue cancer
xenograft model.
EZH2 as the core member of PRC2 has been
linked to multiple aggressive cancers including head
neck cancers. It usually intertwine with other oncogenic
factors and regulators such as Myc, miR-26 and miR-31
to form complex regulatory circuits responsible for cancer
development [31, 32]. EZH2 overexpression associated
with tumor proliferation, lymph node metastasis, disease
stage and poor prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma
[24, 25]. Moreover, EZH2 has been found to promote
malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia, epithelial to
mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell maintenance
in head neck cancers [33]. Our data further extended and
confirmed the aberrant overexpression patterns of EZH2
in tongue cancers. Briefly, our results showed that EZH2
upregulation was associated with pathological grade,
cervical metastasis, Ki-67 expression and reduced overall
survival. Therefore, our results together with previous
studies indicate that aberrant EZH2 overexpression
might be one of the pivotal events during the tongue
tumorigenesis and EZH2 might be a novel and critical
biomarker for diagnosis and prognostic prediction of
patients with tongue cancers.
The clinicopathological significance of EZH2
overexpression in tongue cancers prompt us to further
dissect the possible biological roles of EZH2 during

cell proliferation, assumedly by modulating cell cycle in
tongue cancer cells.
Previous reports have showed that DZNep
selectively induced apoptosis in cancer cells but not
in normal cells by preferential reactivation of genes
repressed by PRC2 including a novel apoptosis effector
FBOX32[20]. Similarly, our data indicated that EZH2
abrogation triggered cell apoptosis and remarkably
increased active caspase-3 abundance after DZNep or
EZH2-targeting siRNA treatment. More interestingly, we
found that EZH2 depletion induced not only cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis, but also cell senescence as evidenced
by increased senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase
activity. It has been well-established that induction of
cell senescence requires the intact pRB-p16 pathway
and/or p53-p21 pathway which are interconnected as
complementary pathways [28, 38]. In agreement with this
notion, EZH2 decrease triggered simultaneous remarkable
gains of two senescence-associated regulators p16 and 21.
Taken together, these data suggest that EZH2 exerts its
oncogenic roles partially through preventing cell apoptosis
and senescence and promoting cell proliferation. DZNep
has the potent anticancer capacity to simultaneously
trigger cell apoptosis and senescence and inhibit cell
proliferation as therapeutic advantage against tongue
cancer.
Recently, emerging evidence indicates that EZH2
silencing results in inhibitions of cell invasion and
migration of several cancer cells and impairs the metastatic
spreading in orthotopic xenograft models [23]. Moreover,
upregulated EZH2 formed a co-repressor complex with
HDAC1/HDAC2/Snail to inhibit E-cadherin which was
responsible for the aggressiveness, invasion and metastasis
of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell [39]. Our previous
reports together with others have revealed that E-cadherin
represents a key master regulator for cancer metastatic
spreading in oral cancer cells [23, 40]. Our data indicated
that EZH2 downregulation significantly inhibited the
invasion and migration properties of tongue cancer cells.
Moreover, the key anti-metastatic regulator E-cadherin
was significantly upregulated, whereas Vimentin was also
downregulated upon EZH2 depletion. Noticeably, the
positive correlation between EZH2 overexpression and
cervical lymph nodes metastasis further strengthened the
finding that EZH2 enhanced cell invasion and migration,
probably partially via modulation of E-cadherin in tongue
cancers.
Mounting evidence has showed that a limited
subpopulation of cancer cells with tumor initiating
properties (termed cancer stem cells) largely accounts for
cancer initiation, progression and therapeutic resistance
[41]. Owing to the key roles of EZH2 as multi-faceted
regulator of somatic stem cells and cancer, itâ€™s plausible
to speculate the potential roles of EZH2 in tongue cancer
stem cell maintenance. Chang and his colleagues have
showed that increased EZH2 expression in CD44+ /
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CD24-/low breast tumor initiating cells correlated with
the increased percentage of this specific subpopulation.
EZH2 promoted expansion of breast tumor initiating
cells through RAF1-p-ERK-Î²-catenin pathway activation
[42]. Moreover, phosphorylation EZH2 binds to and
methylates STAT3, thereby enhancing STAT3 activity,
which promotes tumorigenicity of glioblastoma stem-like
cells [43]. Consistent with these findings, our data showed
that the proportions of CD44+ cells which harbor putative
tongue cancer stem cells in both tongue cancer cell lines
were significantly reduced together with several stem cell
markers downregulation when endogenous EZH2 was
abrogated. These results suggested an important roles
of EZH2 in the maintenance of tongue cancer stem cell.
This phenomenon was further supported by the othersâ€™
findings that DZNep predominantly reduced the number
and self-renewal capacity of hepatocellular carcinoma
initiating cells and selectively abrogated the self-renewal
and tumorigenicity of glioblastoma tumor initiating cells
[22, 43]. Collectively, our findings suggest that EZH2
plays essential roles in maintenance of tongue cancer
cells with stem cell properties. However, further in-depth
investigations into the molecular mechanisms behind the
EZH2 roles in tongue cancer stem cell homeostasis are
warranted.
There is increasing evidence suggests that aberrant
overexpression of EZH2 contributes to acquired
chemotherapeutic resistance in multiple cancers [44, 45].
EZH2 depletion can efficiently reverse such resistance
and sensitized cells to common chemotherapies such
as 5-FU and Cisplatin, and produce greater therapeutic
efficacy via enhanced cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo
[29, 45]. Based on these previous results, we further
determined whether DZNep have the capacity to enhance
the 5-FU anti-cancer efficiency in vitro. Indeed, our data
indicated that DZNep in combination with 5-FU triggered
more pronounced inhibition of cell proliferation and
more cell apoptosis when compare with single agent
alone. Together with previous findings, itâ€™s plausible
to speculate that combination of EZH2 inhibitors and
standard chemotherapy may have superior treatment
efficiency against tongue cancer, although much work is
still needed to further dissect the underlying mechanisms
and substantiate the therapeutic advantages in animal
models and clinical trials.
Given the inherent reversible nature of epigenetic
modifications during cancer progression, DZNep has
been widely exploited as a potent epigenetic modulator
and inhibitor to deplete cellular levels of the PRC2
members including EZH2 and selectively remove
histone H3K27 trimethylation mark in multiple cancers,
thus exhibiting promising anticancer activity [15, 20].
As expected, our data from DZNep therapy in tongue
cancer xenograft model indicated that DZNep delivery
efficiently depleted intratumoral EZH2, significantly
inhibited the tumor growth by reducing cell proliferation
2543

and triggering cell apoptosis. Although previous studies
showed DZNep was a global histone methyltransferase
inhibitor and not specific for EZH2 inhibition and we
canâ€™t rule out other unrecognized mechanisms responsible
for DZNep-mediated anticancer effects, however, these
findings together with others suggested that it yielded
its anticancer effects at least in part via disturbing the
EZH2 oncogenic pathway irrespective of cancer types[26,
34, 46]. However, it still should be noted that complete
abrogation of tumor mass growth and cancer remission
in mice werenâ€™t observed, whereas tumors continued to
grow at a much slower rate following DZNep injection.
It is not surprising that it may be due to the unfavorable
pharmacokinetics, suboptimal dosages and treatment
course of DZNep [47]. To achieve optimized therapeutic
outcomes, several strategies has been tried and verified,
for example DNZnep in combination with other epigenetic
compounds like DNA methyltransferase inhibitors 5â€™AzaC and histone deacetylase inhibitors, gene-specific
small interference RNA molecules or more specific EZH2
inhibitors. Combined epigenetic therapies with DZNep
and histone deacetylase inhibitors have superior efficacy
against multiple cancers [19, 26]. Our unpublished data
also indicated that DZNep together with panobinostat
or sodium butyrate exhibited more potent anticancer
efficacies against tongue cancer cell in vitro and in vivo.
More importantly, very recently several potent and high
selective small-molecule inhibitors of EZH2 have been
developed and testified their therapeutic efficiencies in
multiple cancers with promising results, thus portending
the potential clinical use of EZH2 inhibitors for cancer
treatment in future [48, 49]. Taken together, our data
provide validation of EZH2 as a potential therapeutic
target for tongue cancer treatment and suggest that
pharmacological abrogation of EZH2 by native and
synthetic chemical compounds might hold great promise
as a new therapeutic strategy against cancer.
In conclusion, our results indicate that EZH2
serves as a key oncogenic driver during tongue cancer
progression and functions as a novel biomarker for
diagnosis and prognostic prediction for patients with
tongue cancers. DZNep inhibits EZH2 through inducing
protein degradation and reverse PRC2-H3K27me3mediated gene silencing to yield its anticancer effects.
We anticipate that pharmacological and genetic disruption
of EZH2 and its signaling cascade may represent a novel
therapeutic strategy against tongue cancers.

(a generous gift from Professor Wantao Chen). The other
three cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). Cancerous cell lines were grown
in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Hyclone) and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin,
and maintained in a humidified incubator with 5%CO2 at
370C. DZNep was purchased from Biovision (Category
NO. 2060-250) and Cayman (Category NO. 13828)
commercially and dissolved in DMSO as stocking
solution. Cells were treated with diverse concentration
of DZNep for the indicated times. For the DZNep and
MG132 co-treatment, the cells were treated with DZNep
12h followed by the addition of MG132 at 5ÂµM for
another 12h. For the chemotherapy sensitivity assay in
vitro, cells were treated with 5-fluorouracil (Sigma, 2.5mg/
ml) or/and DZNep (5ÂµM) for the indicated times.

EZH2 siRNA synthesis and transfection
Three small interference RNA molecules targeting
human EZH2 were synthesized and purchased from
Shanghai GenePharma Company. The EZH2-targeting
sequences with confirmed efficiency and specificity have
been reported before [50-52]. The knockdown efficiency
of each siRNA was further confirmed by in vitro delivery
to cells in our prior experiments. To enhance the silencing
efficiency and reduce potential off-target effects, a pool
mixture of equal quantities of EZH2 siRNAs (100nM
total, 33.3nM each) was employed to deplete the
endogenous EZH2 in cancer cell lines using lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s
recommendations. After siRNA transfection for 48h or
72h, the cells were harvested for the further experiments.

Cell immunofluorescence and imaging
The cancerous cells were seeded and grown on
glass coverslips 24h prior to experiment. After fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 15 min, cells were
then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and
sequentially blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for
30 min. Following the overnight incubation with primary
antibody specific for EZH2 (Cell signaling, #5246,
1:200 dilution), these cells were further incubated with
appropriate secondary antibodies and cytoskeleton actin
staining. Immunofluorescence was visualized under a
Zeiss fluorescence microscope and image-captured.

using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM kit (Takara) following
the supplierâ€™s instructions. The gene-specific primers for
human EZH2, CD44, CD133, ALDH1 and GAPDH were
purchased commercially (Invitrogen and Qiagen). Relative
mRNA expression of each gene as compared to internal
control GAPDH was quantified using comparative CT
method.

Cell invasion assay was performed using Matrigel
invasion chambers (8-Î¼m pore size, Corning) in 24-well
plates. Cell inserts were pre-coated with 100% Matrigel
(BD Pharmingen) 24h prior to experiment. Forty-eight
hours after siRNA transfection or drug treatments, cells
were seeded into the upper chambers with medium
containing 1% FBS. Complete medium containing 10%
FBS in the lower chambers served as chemoattractant.
The non-invading cells were gently removed with a
cotton swab and those invasive cell located on the lower
side were stained with crystal violet, photographed and
counted. For wound healing assay, cells were grown into
monolayer and scratched using a sterile 200ÂµL pipette.
Cell migration was observed at various time-points later
by microscopy. Images of 10 scratches per cell line were
captured at the same locations during the experiment and
then compared with Image J software.

Western blotting analysis
The cells with 80% confluence in 25 cm2 culture
flasks were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Equal amounts of protein
samples were loaded and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE
and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) which
then blocked by 5% non-fat dry milk. These blots were
incubated at 40C overnight with primary antibodies EZH2,
cleaved Caspase-3, H3K27me3, H3 (1:1000 dilution)

tubulin (Sigma, 1:3000 dilution) followed by incubations
with secondary antibodies. The relative levels of each
protein were quantified with Quantity One software (Biorad) and GAPDH/tubulin or H3 served as control.

Senescence Î²-galactosidase cell staining
Senescence Î²-galactosidase cell staining was
performed using staining kit purchased from Cell
signaling (#9860) and performed accordingly. Briefly,
cells were fixed in 2%formaldehyde/0.2%glutaraldehy
de/PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature and stained
using Î²-galactosidase staining solution at 370C overnight.
The percentage of SA-Î²-gal positive cells was calculated
from ten randomly chosen fields. At least 500 cells were
analyzed per experiment.

MTT assay
Cell proliferation and viability were monitored by
absorbance using the MTT assay. Approximately 10003000 cells/well were seeded in the 96-well plates. At the
indicated time-points, 5mg/ml MTT (Sigma) was added to
the cells and incubated at 370C for another 4h. Absorbance
at 490 nm was measured with an automatic enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay reader (BioTek Instruments).

Colony forming assay
One thousand cells pretreated with DZNep (5ÂµM,
48h) or vehicle were placed into 6-well plates or dishes
and allowed to grow for two weeks. The cells were
then fixed and stained with crystal violet. The colonies
were further visualized under an invert microscope and
photographed. Cell aggregations with more than 50 cells
were defined as colonies and then counted.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were treated with trypsin and resuspended as
single-cell suspension. For cell cycle analysis, cells were
fixed in 70% ethanol and then stained with propidium
iodide following RNase treatment. The stained cells
were further analyzed for DNA content and cell cycle
distributions using CellQuest software. For apoptosis
assay, cells were stained with Annexin V:PE Apoptosis
Detection Kit (BD Bioscience). For cell surface maker
assay, cells were labeled with human fluorochrome
conjugated anti-CD44-APC (BD Pharmingen) and sorted
by BD FACSVantage flow cytometer. The corresponding
immunoglobulins conjugated APC was used as isotype
controls in each experiment.

for consecutive two weeks or vehicle only. The DZNep
stockings were diluted in PBS immediately before use.
The animal experiments were terminated three days after
the last injection. The tumor diameters were measured by
calipers every 3 days when tumor masses were identified.
Tumor volume was calculated as follows: volume=aÃ—b2/2.
The a was defined as the longest diameter, whereas the
b as the shortest diameter. Tumor weights were also
measured upon tumor samples were harvested.

All quantitative data in the present study was
shown as mean Â± SD unless otherwise stated. Statistical
comparisons were performed by Studentâ€™s t-test or
ANOVA as appropriate. For immunohistochemical
analyses, the associations between EZH2/Ki-67
expression and various clinicopathological parameters
were evaluated using Fisher exact test or Ï‡2-test as
indicated. The overall survival rate was estimated using
Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank test.
The prognostic analyses were performed by univariate
and multivariate Cox regression models to determine
the individual clinicopathological variables with overall
survival. P values less than 0.05 (two-sided) were
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using Graphpad Prism5 or SPSS 18.0.

Patients and tissue specimens
A total number of 84 patients with primary TSCC
(2001 Jan.-2010 Dec.) receiving surgical treatment at the
Department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, Nanjing
Medical University were enrolled. Patient inclusion
criteria were described as follows: (1) primary tongue
squamous cell carcinomas without any prior history of
chemotherapy or radiotherapy; (2) patients underwent
radical tumor resection and neck lymph node dissection
(elective or therapeutic neck dissection as required); (3)
detailed clinical, pathological and follow-up data (followup data available for 72 patients). The archived tissue
samples were retrieved and haematoxylin-eosin stained
slides of each patient were further analyzed to confirm
the previous histological diagnosis according to the
established histological criteria. Sixteen samples of normal
tongue mucosa were obtained from other non-cancer
surgeries during the same period. The normal morphologic
features were confirmed under the microscope for these
normal mucosa. All these patients gave written informed
consent in accordance with our institutional guidelines.
This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the

Immunohistochemical staining for EZH2, Ki67, active caspase-3 was performed similarly as our
previous reports [40, 53]. The immunoreactivity in each
slide was evaluated independently by two senior oral
pathologists without knowledge about the clinical and
pathological data. Negative controls (without primary
