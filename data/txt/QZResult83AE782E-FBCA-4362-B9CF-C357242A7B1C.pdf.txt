ABSTRACT
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is a pivotal enzyme in cellular energy
metabolism that has previously been implicated in cancer through both RNAi based
studies and clinical correlations with poor prognosis in several cancer types.
Here, we report the discovery of a novel and selective ATP competitive panisoform inhibitor of PDK, VER-246608. Consistent with a PDK mediated MOA,
VER-246608 increased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity, oxygen
consumption and attenuated glycolytic activity. However, these effects were only
observed under D-glucose-depleted conditions and required almost complete ablation
of PDC E1α subunit phosphorylation. VER-246608 was weakly anti-proliferative
to cancer cells in standard culture media; however, depletion of either serum or
combined D-glucose/L-glutamine resulted in enhanced cellular potency. Furthermore,
this condition-selective cytostatic effect correlated with reduced intracellular pyruvate
levels and an attenuated compensatory response involving deamination of L-alanine.
In addition, VER-246608 was found to potentiate the activity of doxorubicin. In
contrast, the lipoamide site inhibitor, Nov3r, demonstrated sub-maximal inhibition
of PDK activity and no evidence of cellular activity.
These studies suggest that PDK inhibition may be effective under the nutrientdepleted conditions found in the tumour microenvironment and that combination
treatments should be explored to reveal the full potential of this therapeutic strategy. 

INTRODUCTION

through aerobic respiration [1]. Indeed, this ‘aerobic
glycolysis’ phenotype of cancer cells has been exploited
in the development of 2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET) for the visualisation
and monitoring of a range of different tumour types,
demonstrating the existence of this phenomenon in the
clinical setting [2]. Over the past decade, a growing
body of literature has provided evidence for a direct link
between common oncogenic genetic alterations and the
establishment of an altered metabolic profile [3-6].
These findings have led to a surge of interest in the
identification of factors that represent critical nodes in

It is becoming increasingly recognized that the
aberrant metabolic programme found in cancer cells is not
simply a secondary consequence of the altered expression/
activity of the protein products of cancer-associated genes,
but rather an essential component in the process of cellular
transformation. Studies by Otto Warburg in the 1920s
provided the foundation for this field of cancer biology
with his observation of increased glycolytic rate coupled
with increased glucose uptake in ascites tumour cells, even
in the presence of sufficient oxygen to oxidise glucose

RESULTS

metabolic pathways that are central to the maintenance
of the altered metabolic phenotype of cancer cells.
Several recent studies have provided evidence which
points to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) as one
such factor. PDK, a member of the GHKL ATPase/
kinase superfamily, regulates the activity of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The PDC represents a
central control point in cellular energy metabolism in that
it links glycolysis with the TCA cycle by catalysing the
oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the
matrix of the mitochondria. Therefore, the PDC controls
the degree to which pyruvate is utilised for ATP generation
via oxidative phosphorylation as opposed to alternative
fates such as oxidation to L-lactate or transamination to
L-alanine. The four mammalian isoforms of PDK (PDK1,2,3 & 4) reduce PDC activity through phosphorylation
of specific serine residues in the E1α subunit (pyruvate
dehydrogenase). Conversely, reactivation of the PDC is
controlled by the activity of two E1 phosphatase isozymes,
PDP-1 and PDP-2 [7].
PDK isozymes have been shown to be overexpressed in clinical cancer specimens and this augmented
expression has been correlated with poor prognosis as
well as drug resistance [8-10]. In addition, PDK gene
expression has been shown to be up-regulated under
conditions relevant to the tumour microenvironment such
as hypoxia (PDK-1 & PDK-3) or by inactivating mutations
in common tumour suppressor genes such as p53 (PDK2) and pRB (PDK-4) [11,12]. Previous studies employing
RNAi have provided evidence for a survival role for PDK1 under hypoxic conditions as well as its importance in
maintaining the glycolytic phenotype of cancer cells
[13-15]. DCA, a weak inhibitor of PDK, has previously
been used to study the role of PDK in cancer; however,
interpretation of these studies has been complicated by
conflicting data and the lack of specificity of this agent for
PDK [16-20].
Here, we report the discovery of a novel panisoform ATP competitive inhibitor of PDK, VER-246608.
Using this compound we provide evidence to support
the strategy of targeting the ATP site of PDK in favour
of the lipoamide domain. In addition, we demonstrate
that inhibition of PDK with VER-246608 can disrupt
the glycolytic phenotype of cancer cells, but only under
nutrient-depleted conditions and that almost complete
ablation of biomarker levels were required to observe these
effects. Furthermore, we identify culture conditions and
combinatorial treatments which enhance the therapeutic
efficacy of this agent as well as defining the metabolic
basis for these observations.

VER-246608 is a potent and selective panisoform small molecule inhibitor of pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase
VER-246608 was discovered through a combination
of NMR-based fragment screening and structure-guided
medicinal chemistry to enhance compound potency and
selectivity (Fig. 1A). The X-ray crystal structure of VER246608 bound to PDK-2 (2.6 Ǻ) reveals that the resorcinol
moiety forms a series of direct and water-mediated
hydrogen bonds to various residues within the PDK-2
ATP binding site, including Asp282 and Thr346. The
chloro-methylpyrimidine also forms additional contacts
to the side chains of residues Asn247 and Arg250 with
the di-fluoro pointing towards the open solvent region
(Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows a representative fluorescence
polarization assay binding curve demonstrating the
ability of VER-246608 to compete with a fluoresceinlabeled probe for the ATP binding site of PDK-1. VER246608 demonstrated similar potency across all four PDK
isoforms in a DELFIA-based enzyme functional assay in
the sub 100 nM range (Table 1). Consistent with previous
reports, the lipoamide site-binding compound Nov3r was
found to stimulate the activity of PDK-3 and PDK-4 (but
not PDK-1 or PDK-2) by approximately 2-fold in this
assay (data not shown)[21]; however, in a modified assay
incorporating E1/E2 as the substrate Nov3r generated an
IC50 value of 3 nM. In general, there was good agreement
between the functional assay and binding affinity data for
VER-246608. The marked selectivity of VER-246608 for
PDK-1 versus HSP-90 (a fellow member of the GHKL
kinase family sharing substantial homology with PDK in
the ATP binding pocket) is demonstrated both in terms
of the relative FP IC50 values (>1000 fold selectivity)
and the lack of a detectable induction of HSP-70 (a wellestablished biomarker for HSP-90 inhibition) in PC-3 cells
(Table 1 and Fig. 2C). In order to assess the selectivity of
VER-246608, a ScanEDGE screen (DiscoverX, USA) was
performed at a concentration of 10 µM against a panel
of 97 kinases spanning all 7 kinase family groups. From
the results of this screen, ligand binding to the respective
kinases was reduced to ≤ 10% of control values (100%
of control values indicating no evidence of compound
binding) for only one of the kinases in the panel and
between 10 and 35% for a further seven. Therefore, VER246608 demonstrated significant or partial binding to
only 8% of the kinases on the panel at a concentration
that achieves complete inhibition of PDK activity in
biochemical assays, suggesting a reasonable selectivity
profile for this compound (Fig. 1D).
In terms of cellular biomarker modulation, both
VER-246608 and Nov3r suppressed the phosphorylation

of the Ser293 residue of E1α (phosphorylated by all four
PDK isozymes) with IC50 values of 266 and 55 nM,
respectively, suggesting efficient target engagement
for both compounds. Inspection of the curves from the
p(Ser293)E1α MSD ELISA analysis reveals that although
VER-246608 can achieve complete suppression of
p(Ser293)E1α levels in cells, the degree of suppression
achieved by Nov3r reaches a plateau at an approximately
60% reduction compared to DMSO control values (Fig.
2A). This sub-maximal suppression of p(Ser293)E1α
levels was also observed in other cell lines (for example,
80% in ES-2 cells). This observation would appear to

be at least partly explained by the inability of Nov3r to
achieve complete inhibition of PDK activity in vitro
(Fig. 2B). VER-246608 also demonstrated a similar
degree of potency with regard to its ability to suppress
the phosphorylation of the two remaining serine residues
targeted by the PDK isozymes, S232 (Fig. 2C) and S300
(Fig. 2D). The ability of VER-246608 to reduce cellular
p(Ser293)E1α levels did not appear to be due to alterations
in the expression level of other proteins which could
influence the phosphorylation state of the PDC such as
PDK-1, E1α and PDP-1 (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, both
VER-246608 and Nov3r required a similar period of time

(16 min) to achieve maximal biomarker suppression (Fig.
2F). Another compound, VER-246520, a close analogue
of VER-246608, demonstrated a comparable biochemical
and cellular potency profile as well as a similar binding
mode within the ATP site of PDK-2 (Supplementary Fig.
S1).

ability of this cell line to proliferate in media containing
either D-glucose or D-galactose (requires mitochondrial
respiration to be metabolised) as a fuel source. As can
be seen from Supplementary Fig. S2A, PC-3 cells
demonstrated a substantial reduction in growth in
D-galactose versus D-glucose containing media. K562 and
Jurkat leukemia cell lines were also identified as highly
glycolytic based on this analysis which contrasts with the
oxidative cell line MDA-MD-453 [22]. Treatment of these
cell lines with 20 µM VER-246608 had little to no effect
in either media, indicating that inhibition of PDK does not
rescue growth in D-galactose containing media.
As expected, the observed suppression of p(Ser293)

Inhibition of PDK activity with VER-246608
results in a reversal of Warburg metabolism
To confirm that PC-3 cells demonstrate a
Warburgian (or glycolytic) phenotype, we investigated the

Figure 3: VER-246608 disrupts Warburg metabolism. A, PC-3 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of VER-

246608 and Nov3r for 2 h followed by analysis of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity in cell lysates using a commercially available
ELISA-based assay kit (Abcam). Results are expressed as a percentage of the PDH reaction rate in DMSO treated cells. B, PC-3 cells in
suspension were pre-treated with either DMSO, 20 μM VER-246608 or 3 μM Nov3r for 1 h followed by kinetic measurement of oxygen
levels using a Hansatech ‘oxytherm’ oxygen electrode system. C, D and E, PC-3 cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 1x104
cells per well in 96 well plates. The following day the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of VER-246608 and Nov3r (in
RPMI-1640 media containing 0.25 g/L D-glucose and 2% dialyzed FCS), followed by the removal of culture media for the analysis of
L-lactate (C) and D-glucose (D) levels. The same cells used for the metabolite analysis were analyzed for p(Ser293)E1α levels by MSD
ELISA (E). Results are representative of 2-3 independent experiments performed in triplicate (A and B) or quadruplicate (C-E). Error bars
represent standard deviation of the mean (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01).

E1α levels in cells treated with VER-246608 and Nov3r
resulted in an increase in PDC activity in both PC-3 and
K562 cells, with the magnitude of the increase being
greater for VER-246608 (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig.
S2C). In order to determine whether this increase in PDC
activity resulted in a change in mitochondrial respiration,
we measured the effect of VER-246608 and Nov3r on
oxygen consumption rates in PC-3 cells. Treatment of
PC-3 cells with 20 μM VER-246608 resulted in a 66%
increase in the rate of oxygen consumption, whereas
Nov3r had no discernible effect at concentrations which
exceeded those required to achieve maximal biomarker
suppression (≥ 1μM) (Fig. 3B and Fig. 2B).
We next investigated the effect of these compounds
on glyoclytic rate by measuring L-lactate production and
D-glucose consumption. Initial experiments revealed that
it was necessary to deplete D-glucose levels in the media to

below 0.5 g/L before any change in media L-lactate levels
could be observed in compound treated cells. Treatment of
PC-3 cells with 9 μM and 27 μM VER-246608 resulted in
a 21% and 42% reduction, respectively, in media L-lactate
levels following a 1 h incubation; however, no change was
observed with Nov3r at all concentrations tested (Fig. 3C).
A similar result was obtained following a 6 h incubation;
however, the magnitude of the reduction was slightly
reduced, indicating the induction of a compensatory
cellular response.
VER-246608 also decreased D-glucose consumption
at the same concentrations that resulted in reduced
L-lactate production (Fig. 3D). Analysis of biomarker
levels revealed that that a > 88% reduction in E1α Ser293
phosphorylation was required to observe these effects
(Fig. 3E). The fact that Nov3r did not achieve this level of
biomarker suppression suggests that this is the underlying

plates (2X103 per well). The following day, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of VER-246608 for 120 h followed by

reason for its lack of activity. In agreement with the
above observations, 13C-NMR analysis demonstrated
that treatment of Jurkat cells with 20 μM VER-246608
resulted in a 25% and 23% decrease in the rate of L-lactate
production and D-glucose consumption, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S2D). The ability of VER-246608
to modulate glycolytic activity in the non-transformed
hTert immortalized human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cell
line was also studied. VER-246608 treatment resulted
in a decrease in extracellular L-lactate and D-glucose
levels in this cell line; however, the magnitude of this
reduction was less pronounced compared to PC-3 cells
and only occurred at the top concentration (27 μM) tested
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). As with PC-3 cells, Nov3r
did not alter glycolytic activity in HFF cells at any of the
concentrations tested.

the possibility that combined depletion of D-glucose and
L-glutamine might further influence cytotoxicity was
explored. Reduction of L-glutamine levels to 15 mg/L (in
combination with D-glucose depletion) resulted in both
reduced doubling time and enhanced potency of VER246608 compared to depletion of either of these fuel
sources alone (Fig. 4A). As the cells only completed one
doubling during the experiment under this condition, the
50% reduction in cell mass achieved with 20 μM VER246608 vs DMSO control values equates to an almost
complete inhibition of cell growth. VER-246608 also
achieved a substantial reduction in growth (70% at a
concentration of 20 μM) under serum depleted conditions
(Fig. 4A), with a complete suppression of growth observed
in either serum-free media or media containing very low
levels (0.1%) of serum (Fig. 4B). In contrast, Nov3r
demonstrated no evidence of cytotoxicity/cytostasisinduction under any of the above culture conditions up to
a top concentration of 80 μM.
In order to attempt to identify cancer associated
genetic alterations which predict sensitivity to PDK
inhibition we decided to study cell lines harboring
oncogenic mutations in genes which are linked with
a highly glycolytic phenotype (KRAS) or have been
previously reported to demonstrate sensitivity to PDK-1
knock-down (BRAF) [24, 25]. No evidence of enhanced
sensitivity to VER-246608 was observed for cell lines
possessing these genotypes although, surprisingly, the
oxidative wild-type KRAS breast cancer cell line MDAMB-453 displayed the greatest degree of sensitivity, with
reduced cell mass observed even under normal media
culture conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). In
contrast, VER-246608 was largely inactive against HFF
cells under all of the conditions tested (Supplementary
Fig. S3B).
The nature of the above condition-selective
cytotoxicity was investigated by PI/FACS analysis of
PC-3 cells that had been treated with either DMSO or 20
μM VER-246608 under either standard of serum-depleted
conditions. This analysis revealed an increased fraction
of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in compound
treated cells under serum-starved conditions (Fig. 4C).
No evidence of apoptosis induction was observed based
on a comparison of the percentage of cells in the sub-G1
fraction under both conditions.
As defective oxidative phosphorylation capacity
has been previously linked with sensitivity to treatment
with DCA [17], the ability of VER-246608 to potentiate
the cytotoxicity of cancer therapeutic agents (Doxorubicin,
BEZ235, Cisplatin and 3-Bromopyruvate) which are
known to inhibit mitochondrial function was evaluated.
This analysis revealed that VER-246608 achieved a 2-fold
and 3-fold potentiation of doxorubicin in PC-3 and ES-2
cells, respectfully (Fig. 4D). No evidence of potentiation
of the remaining three agents by VER-246608 was
observed.

VER-246608 induces context-dependent cytostasis
in cancer cells
Having established that VER-246608 can achieve
biological effects in cancer cells that are consistent with
a reversal of Warburg metabolism, we next sought to
investigate whether this compound is cytotoxic to cancer
cells. We found that VER-246608 was weakly cytotoxic
(based on reduced cell mass using the Sulforhodamine B
assay) to a set of cell lines selected for on the basis of
having a high level of PDK-1 mRNA expression (PC-3
& SW-1088) based on publically available (DTP, NCI60) microarray data, as well as additional cell lines (UM22B & MEF) which have been reported to be sensitive to
PDK-1 knock-down under hypoxic conditions [13, 14].
We hypothesized that the supraphysiological D-glucose
concentrations present in standard cell culture media
may be limiting the effect of PDK inhibition due to
elevated intracellular pyruvate concentrations. Therefore,
we decided to explore conditions of limited nutrient
availability or conditions which influence nutrient uptake
such as serum-derived growth factor levels. We found that
in all four of these cell lines, VER-246608 demonstrated
increased efficacy under reduced serum conditions.
Compound potency was also increased in the three
cancer cell lines (but not in the non-transformed MEF
cell line) when the cells were incubated in D-glucosedepleted media (Supplementary Table S1). In contrast to
previous RNAi based studies, no evidence of augmented
compound potency was observed under hypoxic (0.1% O2)
conditions. Incubation of PC-3 cells under milder hypoxic
conditions (1% O2) also showed no effect on compound
potency compared to standard culture conditions (data not
shown). A similar profile of enhanced compound potency
under glucose or serum-depleted conditions was observed
with VER-246520 (Supplementary Table S2).
As cancer cell lines are known to utilize
L-glutamine as a means to fuel anaplerotic reactions [23],

VER-246608 modulates key metabolite levels
under austere culture conditions

We next investigated the effect of PDK inhibition
on cancer cell growth in a 3D culture format. As can
be seen from Fig. 4E, an approximately 50% reduction
in spheroid volume was achieved at concentrations of
10 μM and above, suggesting an increase in compound
potency compared to monolayer growth. Analysis of
the media demonstrated no evidence of the presence of
either LDH or soluble caspase-cleaved Cytokeratin 18
fragments, indicating that the reduction in spheroid size
in the presence of VER-246608 did not result from the
induction of cell death or apoptosis.

In order to better understand the contextdependent cellular activity of VER-246608 we studied
the modulation of key metabolites which would be
expected to be influenced by changes in PDK activity.
The production of one such metabolite, L-lactate, is an
indicator of glycolytic activity, a process which is known
to be central to supporting rapid proliferation [26]. Thus,
the effect of VER-246608 on extracellular L-lactate levels

Figure 5: VER-246608 modulates key metabolite levels in PC-3 cells under nutrient and serum-depleted conditions.

-80ºC for subsequent determination of p(Ser293)E1α levels by MSD ELISA. B, Cells were treated with either DMSO or 20 µM VER-246608

levels. D, Combination index (CI) analysis of PC-3 cells treated with either VER-246608, β-chloro-alanine or a fixed combination ratio of

was investigated under the same conditions employed
in the cytotoxicity studies. We found that L-lactate
production was not altered in VER-246608 compared to
DMSO treated cells cultured in either normal or low serum
media with basal L-lactate production being similar under
both of these conditions (Fig. 5A). However, there was a
substantial reduction in extracellular L-lactate levels when
cells were cultured in D-glucose/L-glutamine-depleted
media with a further reduction observed in the presence
of 10 and 20 μM VER-246608, correlating with a >70%
reduction in p(Ser293)E1α levels.
Pyruvate is a central metabolite both in bridging
glycolysis with aerobic respiration as well as a substrate
for the PDC reaction. Therefore, we next investigated
the effect of VER-246608 on intracellular levels of this
metabolite under the relevant culture conditions. Although
basal pyruvate levels were reduced after a 6 h incubation
period in both the low serum and D-glucose/L-glutamine
depleted conditions, treatment with 20 μM VER-246608
did not alter pyruvate levels further (Fig. 5B). However,
extending this incubation period to 24 h revealed a marked
reduction in intracellular pyruvate levels in the VER246608 treated cells under both D-glucose/L-glutamine
and serum depleted conditions whereas no change was
observed under standard culture conditions. Notably,
based on the analysis of p(Ser293)E1α levels there was an
apparent increase in compound potency under the austere
conditions compared to standard media.
We hypothesized that alternative sources of pyruvate
in the cell are being utilized in an attempt to restore
homeostasis of this metabolite and that this alteration
in metabolic flux may become limiting under nutrient
depleted conditions. We used 1H-NMR metabolomic
analysis in an attempt to identify possible candidate
mechanisms for this compensatory response. This analysis
revealed reductions in the intracellular levels of L-alanine
and the branched chain amino acids leucine and valine
(which can serve as metabolic precursors of L-alanine)
in cells treated with PDK inhibitors (data not shown).
To confirm these observations we measured extracellular
L-alanine levels in cells treated with either DMSO or
increasing concentrations of VER-246608. Incubation of
cells in either serum or D-glucose/L-glutamine-depleted
media resulted in a reduction in baseline extracellular
L-alanine production which was particularly marked in
the D-glucose/L-glutamine depleted media (Fig. 5C).
Interestingly, and in accord with the 1H-NMR data,
treatment with 20 μM VER-246608 resulted in a further
substantial decrease in extracellular L-alanine levels
under both standard and low serum culture conditions,
compared to DMSO treated cells. One interpretation of
these observations is that L-alanine is being utilized to
compensate for loss of cytoplasmic pyruvate resulting from
increased PDC activity through alanine aminotransferase
(ALAT) catalyzed transamination. This hypothesis was
supported by the observation of synergy between the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ALAT inhibitor β-Chloro-alanine and VER-246608 under
normal culture conditions based on combination index
(CI) analysis (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we found that 20
μM VER-246608 could potentiate β-Chloro-alanine in
PC-3 cells (potentiation factor = 1.8 ± 0.06). Therefore,
we propose that the reduction in pyruvate levels in VER246608 treated cells under the above austere conditions is
due to a combination of increased compound potency (and
therefore an elevated rate of pyruvate oxidation by the
PDC) coupled with decreased availability of L-alanine to
compensate for this reduction. Thus, the cell can no longer
maintain pyruvate homeostasis leading to attenuated
glycolytic rate and cell cycle arrest (graphically illustrated
in supplementary Fig. S4).	

DISCUSSION
The growth of interest in cancer metabolism over the
past decade has led to the identification of several novel
therapeutic targets that play important roles in establishing
and maintaining the aberrant metabolic phenotype of
cancer cells [27]. Several key findings over this period
have led to growing support for the proposal that this
phenomenon acts as a driver of both carcinogenesis and
tumour progression, rather than a dispensable secondary
consequence of common cancer-associated genetic
alterations.
PDK has emerged as factor which fits well into
the above paradigm in that it has been implicated in both
the process of cellular transformation as well as a factor
that is deregulated following the activation of common
oncogenic signaling pathways [28, 29]. These findings,
in addition to previous reports which demonstrate the
therapeutic effect of depleting individual PDK isoforms,
paint an encouraging picture for PDK as a target for cancer
therapy.
Initial efforts at developing PDK inhibitors
focused on targeting the lipoamide binding domain.
These compounds, notably AZD7545 and Nov3r, were
developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, with
AZD7545 progressing to a phase 1 clinical trial [30, 31].
One issue with these compounds is that they demonstrate
differential activity towards different PDK isoforms and
actually stimulate PDK-4 activity in biochemical assays
[32]. Our studies have also revealed that Nov3r, in contrast
to VER-246608, cannot achieve complete suppression of
PDK enzyme activity or p(Ser293)E1α biomarker levels in
cells. To date, DCA, which binds to the allosteric pyruvate
binding site on PDK, is the only small molecule that has
been used to study the role of PDK in cancer; however,
this agent is a very weak inhibitor requiring concentrations
in the 5-20 mM range to observe modulation of glycolytic
activity and cytotoxicity. As with the lipoamide site
inhibitors, DCA demonstrates differing activity towards
the four mammalian PDK isoforms and also a lack of
specificity for PDK [33, 13]. In our hands, knock-down of
12870

PDK-1 or PDK-2 did not achieve measurable alterations
in E1α phosphorylation and could therefore not be used as
an approach to complement our small molecule inhibitor
studies.
Here, we describe the discovery of a novel ATP-site
binding pan-isoform PDK inhibitor, VER-246608. Initial
experiments revealed that this compound demonstrated
several biological effects which are consistent with a PDK
mediated mechanism of action. In contrast to previous
RNAi based studies, inhibition of glycolytic activity
was only observed in D-glucose depleted media. Even
under these conditions, almost complete suppression of
p(Ser293)E1α levels were required to observe this effect. A
likely explanation for this observation is the considerable
capacity of cells to maintain homeostasis of pyruvate
levels due to the crucial role played by this metabolite
in central carbon metabolism. In addition, competition
for pyruvate from lactate dehydrogenase due to its
cytoplasmic localization and frequent over-expression
in cancer cells, may limit the amount of pyruvate that is
available to the PDC even when fully activated [34].
In accord with the above findings we observed that
VER-246608 reduced cell mass with enhanced potency
when cells were cultured in either nutrient or serumdepleted media. The nature of VER-246608 mediated
cytotoxicity appeared to be predominantly cytostatic (cell
cycle arrest at G1) with no evidence of apoptosis induction
as assessed by sub-G1 analysis and a lack of an effect
on caspase-3/7 activity (data not shown). Additionally,
combination studies with mitochondriotoxic cancer
therapeutic agents revealed that VER-246608 potentiated
the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. This finding contrasts with
a report which found that DCA actually antagonized the
activity of this agent [35].
Our efforts to link sensitivity to PDK inhibition
with a particular oncogenic mutation status have been
unsuccessful to date. These studies could clearly be
further extended to examine additional oncogenic
mutations linked with a glycolytic phenotype and
sensitivity to glucose depletion such as mutant p53 and
PTEN deficiency [36]; however, the possibility should be
considered that the composition of the extracellular milieu
may prove to be a better predictor of sensitivity rather than
genotype per se (even if they are causally linked).
The metabolic basis for the context-dependent
cytostatic effect of VER-246608 was also explored.
Significantly, VER-246608 treatment was found to result
in a substantial reduction in intracellular pyruvate levels
under serum or nutrient-depleted conditions, whereas no
effect was observed under standard culture conditions. The
additional observation that L-alanine levels in the media
were reduced under these austere conditions with a further
reduction in the presence of VER-246608 under standard
and low serum conditions provided the possibility that
altered flux between pyruvate and L-alanine is being
utilized as a compensatory response. Furthermore, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

observed synergy between VER-246608 and the ALAT
inhibitor β-Chloro-alanine suggests that this mechanism
operates through blocking the ALAT catalyzed synthesis
of pyruvate as opposed to the reverse reaction as, in this
case, a synergistic effect is more readily explained by the
fact that both compounds would work to reduce pyruvate
levels through reduced synthesis and increased oxidation.
Although we are yet to obtain in vivo efficacy
data for our compounds, it is tempting to speculate that
certain characteristics of solid tumours may present
the opportunity for additional therapeutic effects. For
example, reducing lactate production through PDK
inhibition may lead to a reduction in the acidification
of the tumour microenvironment which has been linked
with metastasis promotion and immune evasion [37].
In addition, the recent reports of metabolic symbiosis
between tumour cells as well as between tumour cells and
stromal components might also be disrupted through PDK
inhibition [38, 39].
In summary, our findings have highlighted the
challenging nature of PDK as a target for cancer therapy
by demonstrating the requirement for compound potency
levels that achieve almost complete suppression of
PDC E1α phosphorylation in a concentration range that
would allow realistic progression to animal studies. This
conclusion was further strengthened by our observation
that the lack of cytotoxicity observed with the lipoamide
site inhibitor, Nov3r, appeared to correlate with its
inability to achieve this critical degree of inhibition of
PDK activity.
However, our observation that VER-246608
can effectively disrupt Warburg metabolism as well as
substantially reduce intracellular pyruvate levels under
austere culture conditions, provides evidence that targeting
PDK may present an effective strategy to ‘normalise’
tumour metabolism. In addition, our demonstration that
VER-246608 inhibits proliferation under conditions which
more closely mimic the intratumoral environment both in
monolayer and 3D culture formats provides hope that this
therapeutic strategy may prove to be effective in an in vivo
context as well as suggesting that a reasonable therapeutic
window may be achievable. Furthermore, the ability of
VER-246608 to potentiate the activity of doxorubicin
suggests that combinatorial treatments may also prove to
be a fruitful strategy to pursue with PDK inhibitors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, culture and reagents
All cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), grown in their recommended
culture media supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics
(penicillin / streptomycin) and passaged for < 4 months

mycoplasma infection. The synthesis of VER-246608 and
VER-246520 is described in the supplementary methods.
β-Chloro-L-alanine, 2-deoxyglucose and 3-bromopyruvate
(Sigma) were dissolved in water. Cisplatin (Selleckchem)
was dissolved in saline solution (0.1% (w/v) NaCl).
BEZ235 (Selleckchem) & doxorubicin (Calbiochem)
were dissolved in DMSO. Media containing depleted
levels of D-glucose and/or L-glutamine were prepared by
their addition to media lacking these components (Life
Technologies). Normal media contained D-glucose and
L-glutamine at a final concentration of 11 mM (2 g/L) and
2 mM (0.3 g/L), respectively.

Crystallization and X-ray structure determination
For co-crystallisation studies Human PDK-2
(16-407aa) was mixed with Compound Pfz3 (N-(2aminoethyl)-2-{3-chloro-4-[(4-isopropylbenzyl)
oxy]phenyl}acetamide); Pfizer, Patent application:
EP1247860, 1-304, 2002) at 3-fold molar excess before
being concentrated to 10 mg/ml. This liganded PDK2 crystallized in 0.1 M Sodium acetate pH 5.8, 0.125
M magnesium chloride and 6% isopropanol using the
hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 4ºC. Crystals
grew within 48 h.
For data collection the protein crystals were flashfrozen at 100K using a cryo-protection buffer consisting
of stabilising solution and 30-35% glycerol. Diffraction
data of PDK-2 in complex with VER-246608 and VER246520 were collected at 100K on a RIGAKU RAXIS4++
image plate detector with a laboratory rotating anode
generator using CuKα radiation. Data processing was
carried out with the D*TREK program package [41] and
data collection statistics are summarised in Supplementary
Table 3. The structures were determined by molecular
replacement using the published unliganded PDK-2
structure (PDBcode 2BTZ) to calculate model phases and
subsequently refined using REFMAC5 [42].
Interactive graphical model building was carried out
with COOT. In both structures the respective ligands were
clearly defined by the initial electron density maps.

Immunoblotting
Cell lysates were prepared by washing cells with
PBS followed by the addition of lysis buffer (2% SDS,
50 mM TRIS-pH 6.8) directly to the well. Equal amounts
of lysate were loaded onto pre-cast 4-12% SDS-PAGE
gels (Life technologies) followed by transfer to PVDF
membrane. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in
TBST containing 5% non-fat dried milk, followed by a
2 h incubation with the relevant primary antibody: PDH
phospho(Ser293)E1α (Genescript, custom rabbit polyclonal
antibody), 1:600; PDH E1α (Abcam), 1:1000; PDP-1
(Sigma), 1:2000; PDK-1 (ENZO), 1:1000; HSP-70 (Santa
Cruz), 1:5000;   β-tubulin (Cell signaling technology),
1:1000. The membranes were then incubated with HRPlinked goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Santa Cruz) followed by visualization of immunoreactive
bands by the addition of a chemiluminescent substrate
(Millipore).

Fluorescence polarization assay
This assay was developed using a fluoresceinlabelled probe, VER-160364 (5-[({4-[5-(5-chloro-2,4dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(ethylcarbamoyl)-1,2-oxazol-4-yl]
phenyl}methyl)
carbamoyl]-2-(6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9yl)benzoic acid), which binds to the ATP site of PDK
resulting in an increase in anisotropy. PDK-1 protein
was used at its Kd concentration of 30 nM, which was
determined by titration with a probe concentration of 10
nM.
Compounds were tested in a 384-well format
incorporating 10-point tripling titration curves in assay
buffer (50 mM MOPS pH 7.5; 50 mM K2PO4;150 mM
NaCl; 1 mM DTT; 5% Glycerol; 0.1% Octyl-D-βglucopyranoside). Following a 90 min incubation period,
the plates were read using a Biotek Synergy plate reader
(Ex 485/20 nM; Em 528/20 nM) and Delta mP was
calculated by subtracting free probe values from the values
obtained at the varying compound concentrations. The data
was fitted by non-linear regression using XLFIT4 within
a custom ABASE (IDBS) protocol in order to determine
IC50 values. The HSP-90ß FP assay was conducted as

Protein expression and purification
The four mammalian PDK isoforms and the E2
subunit of the PDC were amplified (PDK-1: residues 30436; PDK-2: residues 16-407; PDK-3: residues 9-406;
PDK-4: residues 1-412; E2: residues 126-233) from full

His tag fusion proteins with either a TEV (PDK-1, PDK-3,
PDK-4 and E2) or a Thrombin (PDK-2) protease cleavage

2.0, CA, USA) and expressed as an N-terminal His tag
fusion protein. The recombinant proteins were expressed
in E.coli BL21 cells and purified on a Ni2+ affinity
HiTrap column (GE Healthcare, USA) followed by size
exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column
(GE Healthcare, USA) and used directly for activity and
binding affinity assays. For protein crystallization, PDK-2
was treated with TEV protease to yield untagged protein.

culture plates. The following day, the cells were treated
with a 10 point tripling dilution series of test compound
for 24 h followed by fixation with TBS containing 4%
formaldehyde for 15 min at RT. The cells were then

were then acquired on a FACSArray (BD Biosciences)
flow cytometer and the data analyzed using FACSDiva
software.

PDC activity

Combination index (CI) analysis and potentiation
assays

Cellular PDC activity was determined using a
commercial assay kit (Abcam) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, PC-3 and K562 cell suspensions
at a density of 1X106 and 1.5X106, respectively, were
transferred to 96 well plates (250 µL per well). Cells were
pre-treated with compound or DMSO for 1 h in a CO2
incubator at 37ºC followed by cell lysis in 250 µL of a 9:1
dilution of assay kit detergent (containing 20 mM NaF and
40 µM of the PDK inhibitor VER-246550) for 10 min on
ice. The cellular debris was then pelleted at 1000g for 10
min. A 200 µL aliquot of each lysate was then transferred
to the immunocapture microplate. PDC reaction rates
were determined from the slope of the reaction curves and
expressed as a percentage of the vehicle (DMSO) control
values.

For drug synergy studies (CI analysis) PC-3 cells
were seeded into 96 well plates and treated with a seven
point doubling dilution of β-Chloro-L-alanine, VER246608 or a fixed ratio combination of both agents.
The cells were then incubated for 120 h followed by
cell mass determination using the Sulforhodamine B
assay. Fa (fraction affected) values were calculated by
normalizing DMSO control values to 1 (a Fa value of 0.5
is equivalent to a GI50). Drug interactions were analyzed
by the combination index (CI) method based on the
method described by Chou [44]. CI values <0.9 indicates
synergism, 0.9 to 1.1 additivity, and >1.1 antagonism. The
data was expressed in the form of Fa-CI simulation plot
generated using calcusyn software (Biosoft). Potentiation
assays were carried out as described previously [45].

Oxygen consumption

Conflict of interest statement

Oxygen consumption was measured using an
‘oxytherm’ oxygen electrode system (Hansatech). PC-3
cells were trypsinized and re-suspended to a density of
1.7X106 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 media containing 10%
FCS. Compounds or DMSO were then added to 1.5 mL
aliquots of this suspension to yield the required final
concentration followed by a 1 h incubation period in a
CO2 incubator at 37ºC. The compound/vehicle treated cells
were then transferred to the oxygen electrode chamber
(pre-equilibrated to 37ºC). Oxygen consumption was
measured over a 30 minute period and the rate of oxygen
consumption determined by plotting oxygen concentration
against time and obtaining the slope of the line using the
linear fit function within excel.
