Abstract
Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that induces
differentiation, growth arrest, and/or apoptosis of malignant
cells both in vitro and in vivo and has shown clinical responses
in f30% of patients with advanced mycosis fungoides and
Sézary syndrome cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The
purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers predictive of
vorinostat response in CTCL using preclinical model systems
and to assess these biomarkers in clinical samples. The signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling
pathway was evaluated. The data indicate that persistent
activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 correlate with
resistance to vorinostat in lymphoma cell lines. Simultaneous
treatment with a pan-Janus-activated kinase inhibitor resulted
in synergistic antiproliferative effect and down-regulation of
the expression of several antiapoptotic genes. Immunohistochemical analysis of STAT1 and phosphorylated tyrosine
STAT3 (pSTAT3) in skin biopsies obtained from CTCL patients
enrolled in the vorinostat phase IIb trial showed that nuclear
accumulation of STAT1 and high levels of nuclear pSTAT3 in
malignant T cells correlate with a lack of clinical response.
These results suggest that deregulation of STAT activity plays a
role in vorinostat resistance in CTCL, and strategies that block
this pathway may improve vorinostat response. Furthermore,
these findings may be of prognostic value in predicting the
response of CTCL patients to vorinostat. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a group of non–
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) caused by malignant, skin-homing
T cells (1–3). The most common variants are mycosis fungoides
(MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS). The latter is the erythrodermic
and leukemic form of the disease. The histone deacetylase (HDAC)
inhibitor vorinostat (Zolinza, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) has

been approved for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in
patients with MF/SS who have progressive, persistent, or recurrent
disease on or after two systemic therapies (4–7). Vorinostat
provided objective clinical and symptomatic relief in 30% of
heavily pretreated patients with MF/SS (6, 7). These results
prompted the search for molecular markers predictive of treatment
outcome.
Preclinical studies have shown that vorinostat affects proliferation of a variety of transformed cell lines in culture and of human
cancer xenografts in mice (8). In vitro, vorinostat inhibits HDACs of
class I and class II, and treatment of cells with this compound at
clinically achievable concentrations results in an increase in
acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. Both transcriptional and nontranscriptional effects of vorinostat have been linked
to its antitumor activity. These include reexpression of tumor
suppressor genes, increased oxidative stress, modulation of
immune response, and inhibition of angiogenesis (9, 10). Depending on the cancer type and genetic background, response to
vorinostat may be dependent on any or all of these biological
responses. Likewise, resistance to this agent could arise from a
variety of molecular mechanisms capable of counteracting or
blocking these effects. Because vorinostat is currently being
evaluated in a number of hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, further investigation of the underlying factors that determine
clinical response to this compound will enhance our ability to
identify cancer patients who will most likely benefit from this
therapeutic modality.
To that end, pretreatment biomarkers of response to vorinostat
were identified in preclinical experiments, and their relevance to
clinical response was investigated. In the present study, we report
the evaluation of the roles of the signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) proteins in the response of human lymphoma
to vorinostat treatment. STAT proteins are a group of transcription
factors involved in signaling from a number of growth factor and
cytokine receptors, and their deregulation has been associated with
malignant transformation (11–14). The STAT family comprises
seven members with a high degree of homology at the amino acid
level. Of these, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5a, and STAT5b are
ubiquitously expressed and phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine
residues in response to a variety of stimuli (15). STAT proteins are
activated in lymphoid cells by cytokine receptors that engage the
Janus-activated kinases (JAK; JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) to
induce their tyrosine phosphorylation (16). More recent work has

shown that STATs can also be activated by oxidative stress, a
prevalent condition in the cancer milieu (17).
Both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation are necessary for STAT
nuclear localization and full transcriptional activity. Cytokine
autocrine loops, tyrosine kinase activation, and silencing of STAT
negative regulators, including the suppressors of cytokine signaling
proteins, as well as the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2,
commonly occur in cancer cells. Therefore, multiple mechanisms
lead to the sustained STAT phosphorylation detected in human
tumors (18, 19). Persistent activation of STATs is widely observed
in hematologic malignancies including B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, as well as solid tumors, including cancers of the lung, breast,
ovaries, head and neck, prostate, and skin (13, 20–23). In particular,
STAT3 has been shown to be an oncogene capable of transforming
immortalized mouse and rat fibroblasts (24). Constitutive STAT
activation contributes to malignant transformation at least in part
by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell death. Indeed,
the expression of several cell cycle control and antiapoptotic genes
is regulated by these transcription factors (13). In addition,
overexpression of STAT1 and STAT3 has been associated with
resistance to platinum-based drugs (25, 26). Constitutive activation
of STAT3 has also been linked with poor response to chemotherapy
in breast cancer cells (27). In lymphoid malignancies, a lack of
STAT3 activation correlates with a favorable clinical outcome, and
inhibition of STAT3 activity sensitizes resistant NHL cells to
chemotherapy (28, 29).
In light of the evidence supporting the contribution of activated
STATs to the survival of cancer cells, we investigated the role of
STAT pathway activation in the response of lymphoma cells to
vorinostat. The results indicate that constitutive activation of
STATs is involved in resistance to vorinostat across a variety of
B-cell and T-cell lymphoma lines, including those of CTCL origin.
Furthermore, high levels of phosphorylated tyrosine STAT3
(pSTAT3) and nuclear localization of STAT1 in malignant T cells
from skin biopsies of MF/SS patients correlate with a lack of
clinical response to vorinostat.

DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated using polyacrylamide
criterion Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Invitrogen) in Novex Tris-glycine transfer buffer (Invitrogen)/
20% methanol/0.01% SDS. The membranes were blocked in TBS/Tween 20
(TBS-T)/5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) and probed with
anti-STAT1, anti–phosphorylated serine STAT1, anti-STAT3, anti–phosphorylated serine STAT3, anti-STAT5, or antibodies against the tyrosinephosphorylated form of the proteins (Cell Signaling Technology), as well as
anti-STAT5B (Chemicon). Anti–h-actin and anti-actin (Sigma) were used as
loading controls. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and then probed in
the dark with secondary antibody, Zymax goat anti-rabbit Cy5, and goat
anti-mouse Cy5 (Zymed). Fluorescence emission was measured using the
Typhoon 9410 (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were quantified using
ImageQuant software.
Reverse-phase protein microarray analysis. Microarrays were manufactured, as previously described (30). Briefly, 20 nL of denatured protein
lysates were immobilized onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides using a
GMS470 Affymetrix microarrayer in an ordered array. Printed arrays were
washed with distilled H2O, blocked for 2 h at room temperature with I-Block
(Tropix) containing 0.1% Tween 20, followed by blocking of endogenous
biotin, incubation with primary antibody at a concentration of 1:1,000
(45 min), and biotinylated secondary antibody at 1:5,000 (30 min). After
secondary incubation, arrays were incubated with strepavidin-biotin
complex (15 min), biotinyl tyramide (15 min), and strepavidin-peroxidase
(15 min) and developed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(4 min). Total protein detection was determined by SYPRO ruby blot stain
(Molecular Probes), as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Stained arrays were
scanned on a Unimax scanner with 256 gray scale at 600 dpi and quantified
using Imagequant. Staining intensities were normalized to total protein
concentrations. Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Gene expression profiling and real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was
isolated from each cell line using RNeasy Midi or Mini kits (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For gene expression profiling
studies, amplification was performed using standard protocol (31).
Expression of f25,000 human genes was determined by hybridization to
60-mer oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) using Stratagene
Universal human reference RNA as control. Gene expression was
normalized using standard methods, and statistical analysis was performed
as previously described (32).
For the real-time PCR expression analysis, cDNAs were synthesized using
the high-capacity cDNA archive kit, and the PCR amplification was
performed in 384-well plates in triplicate using the 7900HT fast real-time
PCR system following the manufacturer’s suggested procedure (Applied
Biosystems). Optimized primers and probes (TaqMan gene expression
assays; Applied Biosystems) for Bcl-xL, survivin, Mcl-1, Bax, Bad, Osm, JunB,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and h-actin were
used in these studies. The amplification protocol was as follows: 50jC for
2 min, 95jC for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95jC at 15 s and 60jC for 1 min.
The data were analyzed using the comparative cycle threshold (C t) method.
The C t values were normalized with those of actin.

with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Samples were imaged and
photographed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope.
Transfection of STAT3 and STAT5 small interfering RNA oligonucleotides. HuT 78 cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L STAT3, STAT5A,
and STAT5B small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (SMARTpool,
Dharmacon) or luciferase control duplex (negative control) using
X-tremeGene transfection Reagent (Roche). Cells were seeded in 24-well
plates and treated according to the manufacturer’s procedure, and
48 h posttransfection, vorinostat was added to the cells as indicated. Each
condition was done in triplicate. The effect on proliferation/viability was
assessed using ViaLight Plus kit (Lonza).
Clinical specimens. Skin biopsies were collected from 51 MF/SS
patients enrolled in the phase IIb clinical trial (7). All patients provided
written informed consent before enrollment, and the study protocol was
approved by the institutional review boards of all the participating
academic centers. Serial 4-mm punch biopsies were taken from the skin
lesion at baseline (before first vorinostat dose). Tissues were fixed in
formalin and embedded in paraffin. The primary end point of the trial was

the objective response rate measured by mSWAT. The objective response
rate was 29.7% overall. Secondary end points included time to response,
time to progression, duration of response, and pruritus relief. Median time
to response was <2 mo, and time to progression was 4.9 mo. Median
duration of response was not reached but estimated to be z185 d, and 32%
of the patients had pruritus relief.
Immunohistochemical analysis of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 in skin
biopsies. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 Am and stored in
nitrogen until immunostained. Sections were dewaxed in xylenes,
rehydrated through graded alcohols, and then incubated in 0.3% H2O2 in
methanol for 20 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase
activity. Antigen retrieval was performed using a commercially available
citrate-based solution (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in 10%
normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated
with polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT1 (Cell Signaling
Technology; 1:200 dilution), STAT5 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000
dilution), STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:50 dilution), and pSTAT3 (Cell
Signaling Technology; 1:50 dilution) followed by a biotinylated secondary

of each section and projected on a screen to validate this approach. Tumor
cells were identified by a combination of criteria, including location within
the epidermis (Pautrier microabscesses), nuclear size, and nuclear convolutions, often described as cerebriform nuclei. Tumor cells thus identified were scored for strong staining (2+), weak staining (1+), or no staining
in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The number of positively stained
cells was also documented. The score recorded was the most prominent for
identifiable tumor cells. The pathologist (M.E.K.) who scored the staining
had no knowledge of the nature of the patient’s clinical response or whether
the specimen was obtained before or after therapy.
Statistical analysis. Fisher’s exact test was used to examine the significance of the association between vorinostat response and STAT1 subcellular localization (nuclear or nuclear/cytoplasmic), as well as vorinostat
response and pSTAT3 or STAT5 staining intensity (+1 or +2). The P value from
the test was computed for a 2  2 contingency table with fixed margins (34).

the cell lines. Vorinostat response was also evaluated in a panel
composed of 150 human cancer cell lines from colon, breast, and
lung origin (Fig. 1B). Noteworthy, compared with the colon, breast,
and lung cancer cell lines, the lymphoma subset had the largest
number of cell lines with the lowest half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50). These data are reminiscent of the spectrum of
clinical responses for vorinostat as a single agent documented to
date. In vitro response criteria based on the results from the two
phenotypic assays were established. The available clinical data on
vorinostat exposure guided the selection of the threshold vorinostat concentration (35). Lymphoma cell lines with proliferation/
viability IC50 values of V1 Amol/L (clinically achievable) that
underwent apoptosis in response to vorinostat at 1 Amol/L as
assessed by activation of caspase-3,7 or DNA fragmentation were
classified as sensitive. Because of the clinical activity shown by
vorinostat in MF/SS, four human T-cell lymphoma lines originated
from CTCL patients, including HH, HuT 78, H9, and MJ, were

www.aacrjournals.org

included in the panel (36–38). The more responsive CTCL line HH
exhibited an IC50 of f0.8 Amol/L and underwent apoptosis in
response to vorinostat, as assessed by TUNEL assay. In contrast,
H9, HuT 78, and MJ cells (IC50, >2 Amol/L) showed an increase in
the population in the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle but did not
show signs of DNA fragmentation upon vorinostat treatment for
48 hours (Fig. 1C; Table 1). Overall, the response to vorinostat of
these CTCL lines fall within the range of the larger panel and are in
agreement with results previously reported (38). The ability of the
HDAC inhibitors valproate and trichostatin A to induce apoptosis
in vorinostat-sensitive and vorinostat-resistant lymphoma lines
was evaluated. The response pattern of valproate and trichostatin
A mirrored that of vorinostat across the cell lines examined
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

with decreased levels of STAT3 and STAT5B was evaluated and expressed as percentage of untreated cells. Columns, average of two independent experiments;

pattern for several members of the JAK/STAT pathway that
correlated with vorinostat sensitivity (Fig. 2A). In particular,
STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 expression were significantly elevated
among the cell lines with the highest vorinostat IC50 values. Similar results were obtained by reverse-phase protein microarray
analysis performed on whole-cell extracts prepared from a subset
of the cell lines profiled (Fig. 2B). Principally, reverse-phase protein
microarrays are used to assess phosphorylation changes en masse
of key signaling nodes, as well as to compare expression levels of
signaling proteins in cancer cells and tissues (30, 39). Briefly,
protein lysates (5 nL/spot/array) are immobilized onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides, and printed arrays are probed with antibodies against a repertoire of signaling proteins covering the major
signal transduction pathways. In this study, a total of 50 proteins
covering eight major signaling pathways were assayed. STAT1
and STAT3 were represented in the antibody panel. These two
transcription factors emerged as the most consistently, differentially overexpressed proteins in the resistant versus sensitive cell
lines examined. For a comparison, the levels of caspase-3 expression in these cell lines are shown.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (10). May 15, 2008

Based on these observations, the expression, as well as
phosphorylation, of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 across lymphoma
cell lines were examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A).
Differences in STAT3 expression levels were subtle; however,
the levels of STAT1 and STAT5 proteins were in general higher
in the group less responsive to vorinostat. In addition, tyrosine and serine phosphorylation levels of STAT1, STAT3, and
STAT5 were generally elevated in this cell line subset. Given
the clinical efficacy that vorinostat has shown in patients with
MF/SS CTCL, STAT activation was specifically compared among
CTCL lines (Fig. 3B). This focused panel showed a similar
correlation between STAT activation and low vorinostat sensitivity that recapitulated the results seen across the broad B-cell
and T-cell lymphoma panel. Consistent with previous reports,
tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was detectable in the CTCL
lines evaluated; however, higher levels were observed in the
more resistant cell lines (40, 41). In the CTCL lines tested,
expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3,
and STAT5 were not affected by vorinostat treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). The differences observed in phosphorylation

of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 prompted the examination of their
localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. Because phosphorylated STAT proteins form dimers that translocate into the
nucleus to initiate transcription, differences in their subcellular
localization were investigated. Upon staining of vorinostatsensitive HH cells with antibodies directed against STAT1, a weak
signal scattered throughout the cell was observed (Fig. 3C).
In contrast, in vorinostat-resistant MJ cells, the intense STAT1
signal was mainly concentrated in the nuclear compartment.
Similar results were obtained with antibodies against serinephosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3, as well as
STAT5 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Elevated STAT activity is functionally linked to vorinostat
resistance in CTCL cell lines HuT 78 and MJ. The role of
STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 deregulation in the response to
vorinostat was further investigated. The effect of vorinostat on
cell proliferation was evaluated in combination with an inhibitor
of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, upstream activators of STAT
proteins. The JAKi (Calbiochem) is a potent inhibitor of JAK1,

JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2. Coincubation of HuT 78 cells with
vorinostat and JAKi resulted in a mild synergistic antiproliferative
effect (combination index, 0.28; Fig. 4A). Furthermore, synergistic
induction of apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL assay upon
treatment with the vorinostat-JAKi combination for 48 hours
(Fig. 4A). A decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was
detectable by immunoblot analysis after treatment with JAKi
(Fig. 4A), indicating that the JAK inhibitor effectively blocked
activation of STAT proteins in the CTCL HuT 78 cells. Similar
results were obtained in MJ cells, wherein dephosphorylation of
STAT5, the most predominantly STAT member, expressed in this
CTCL line was noted (Supplementary Fig. S4). The effect of
STAT1, STAT3, STAT5a, and STAT5b knockdown on the response
of HuT 78 cells to vorinostat was examined. The sensitivity of
HuT 78 cells to vorinostat was increased by down-regulation of
STAT3 and STAT5b expression levels (Fig. 4B). Despite significant
knockdown of STAT1 and STAT5a (70% or higher), the effect on
vorinostat response was modest (Supplementary Fig. S5A). It is
possible that the coexpression of these STAT proteins in the T-cell

lymphoma lines analyzed contributes to signaling redundancy
and thus explains the effects observed upon STAT1 and STAT5a
knockdown. In addition to STAT loss-of-function experiments,
overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 in vorinostatsensitive HH and SUPT1 cells resulted in an increase in vorinostat
IC50 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Overall, results from genetic and
pharmacologic studies aimed at reducing activation of STAT
proteins suggest that elevated STAT activation contributes to
vorinostat resistance.
In addition to phosphorylation, HDACs are required for
transactivation of STAT proteins (42–44). Contrasting results
from studies that examined the effect of HDAC inhibitors on
STAT3 phosphorylation have been reported (44, 45). In addition,
work from several groups has shown that trichostatin A
interferes with the transcriptional activity of STATs by (a)
blocking HDAC activity and leading to their hyperacetylation, (b)
inducing deactylation of components of the STAT-associated
transcription machinery like CAAT/enhancer binding protein h,
and (c) interfering with the HDAC1-mediated recruitment of
factors, such as RNA polymerase II, to their target promoters
(43, 46, 47). Under the experimental conditions selected for this
study, vorinostat treatment did not affect phosphorylation of
STAT3 (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S2) or STAT5 (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S4). To determine whether vorinostat
treatment resulted in an increase in STAT1, STAT3, or STAT5
acetylation, proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected
to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against acetyl-lysine. In
the case of STAT3, the modest basal acetylation signal was
unaffected by vorinostat treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6).
No acetylation of STAT1 and STAT5 was detected pre-vorinostat
or post-vorinostat treatment. It is well established that antiapoptotic genes, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and survivin, are
transcriptionally controlled by STAT5 and/or STAT3 (48–50).
Thus, modulation of the expression of these target genes,
presumably involved in vorinostat resistance, was assessed.
Changes in mRNA expression of relevant genes were quantified
by quantitative PCR (Fig. 4C). Treatment of HuT 78 cells with the
JAKi at the concentrations chosen for the combination study
resulted in modest repression of the four antiapoptotic genes
evaluated, similar to that achieved by vorinostat alone.
Conversely, treatment of HuT 78 cells with the combination for
24 hours led to significant down-regulation (>2.4-fold) in their
expression. A number of STAT5 target genes, including c-Myc
and Osm, were also affected by this treatment. Of note, the
expression of Bax, Bad, GAPDH, a housekeeping gene, and JunB,
a cytokine-inducible gene, remained largely unchanged. Altogether, these findings raise the possibility that the synergistic
antiproliferative activity of this combination results from the
concerted effects of HDAC inhibition and JAK inhibition on the
STAT-mediated transcriptional control of prosurvival and
growth-promoting genes.
High expression and aberrant activation in skin biopsies
from nonresponders of the phase IIb CTCL trial. The results
gathered from the preclinical studies in human B-cell and T-cell
lymphoma lines prompted the evaluation of STAT1, STAT3,
STAT5, and pSTAT3 staining in skin biopsies obtained from MF/
SS patients enrolled in the vorinostat phase IIb clinical trial. The
description of the clinical trial design, end points, and patient
population enrolled has been previously described (7). A total of
51 skin biopsies, one per patient, were collected before vorinostat
treatment. Of the 51 samples stained, three low quality specimens

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (10). May 15, 2008

were left out from the analysis. Immunohistochemical evaluation
of the four markers was performed on 48 skin biopsies. Tumor
cells were identified by a combination of criteria, including
location within the epidermis (Pautrier microabscesses), nuclear
size, and nuclear convolutions often described as cerebriform
nuclei (Supplementary Fig. S7). The percentages of malignant
T-cells stained, the predominant intensity of staining, and the
subcellular localization of the signal were recorded. The results
for each MF and SS patient analyzed are provided (Supplementary Table S1).
The analysis showed that STAT1 expression was detectable in
malignant T cells from 43.7% of the samples (21 positively stained;
22 negatively stained; 5 poor quality specimens or no malignant
cells identified). Representative examples of STAT1 staining in
partial responders and nonresponders are shown (Fig. 5A). In cases
where STAT1-positive cells were observed, a relationship between
nuclear accumulation of STAT1 and lack of response to treatment
existed (P < 0.01; Fisher’s exact test). The intensity of STAT3
staining was high (+2) in the majority of the biopsies evaluated. No
correlation between vorinostat response and STAT3 expression or
localization could be determined from the samples analyzed.
Representative images from skin biopsy sections stained for
pSTAT3 are presented (Fig. 5B). Nuclear pSTAT3 could be detected
in all 48 samples evaluated at either a low level (+1 staining) or a
high level (+2 staining). Statistical analysis of the immunohistochemical data indicates that patients with malignant T cells
showing low nuclear pSTAT3 staining (+1) have a significantly
greater chance of responding to vorinostat treatment (P < 0.001)
than the patients whose samples showed high intensity (+2)
nuclear staining.
In the case of STAT5, expression was detectable in malignant
T cells from 41 of the 48 samples analyzed. In most cases,
staining was confined to the nuclear compartment. Although
STAT5 staining intensity was not significantly different between
samples from nonresponder and partial responder patients (P =
0.08 > 0.05), a trend was observed between high levels of
expression and lack of clinical response. A summary of the data
gathered from the immunohistochemical analysis of STAT1,
STAT5, and pSTAT3 is provided (Fig. 5C). When compared, the
accuracy of pSTAT3 and STAT1 is similar (87.5% and 85.71%,
respectively); however, the predictive power of pSTAT3 is
superior. Phosphorylated STAT3 was detectable in all biopsies
analyzed and thus constitutes a more robust marker across this
sample set. This marker performed similarly across both MF
(P < 0.023; 90% prediction accuracy) and SS (P < 0.015, 83%
prediction accuracy) patient samples evaluated (Supplementary
Table s1). From this analysis, 6 of 48 patients (12.5%) were
misclassified as to clinical response by pSTAT3 staining. The
same six patients were also either misidentified by STAT1 or did
not show STAT1 staining. Therefore, combining STAT1 and
pSTAT3 scores did not improve the prognostic accuracy for
clinical response. Lastly, two of the four nonresponder patients
misidentified by pSTAT3 and STAT1 staining were among those
with stable disease (patients 6 and 19; Supplementary Table S1).
These are patients with low pSTAT3 staining that did not meet
the criteria of clinical response; however, they experienced some
clinical benefit from vorinostat treatment. This observation may
explain two of the four outlier patients and suggests that low
pSTAT3 levels may identify not only responder patients but also
those patients that experienced stable disease within the
nonresponder population.

STATs Predict Vorinostat Resistance in T-Cell Lymphoma

Discussion
The present study showed that lymphoma cell lines, including
CTCL, that respond poorly to vorinostat treatment in vitro possess
higher baseline levels of activated STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5
relative to the more sensitive cell lines examined. These results
seem to be of clinical relevance, as they are consistent with the
differential activation of STAT1 and STAT3 detected in pretreatment skin biopsies from nonresponder MF/SS CTCL patients from
the phase IIb trial.
It is clear that the STAT family of transcription factors serves
as an integrator of signals coming from a number of external
stimuli, and their activation is a highly regulated process. Genetic
or epigenetic alterations that impinge at various levels of the
signaling cascade upstream of the STATs result in constitutive
phosphorylation of these proteins and have been associated with
increased proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and malignancy. It
is not surprising then that in some cancers the same STATmediated transcriptional program that sustains expression of
prosurvival factors may affect the response of cancer cells to drug
treatment.
Elevated expression or phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and/
or STAT5 has been negatively correlated with response to
chemotherapy in ovarian cancer, non–small cell lung cancer cell,
multiple myeloma, and NHL cells in vitro (25, 26, 29).
Furthermore, high levels of pSTAT3 correlated with invasive
breast cancer and resistance to combined doxorubicin/docetaxel
therapy (27). In some cases, high levels of various STATregulated genes with antiapoptotic function, such as Mcl-1,
survivin, and Bcl-xL, seem to be an underlying mechanism
associated with aberrant STAT activation and poor response to
chemotherapeutic agents. The present investigation failed to
establish a clear relationship between activation of STATs and
the mRNA expression of some of these genes. In addition to
transcriptional control, posttranslational modifications that are
not captured by gene expression analysis regulate the activity of
proteins involved in the apoptotic cascade. It is possible that in
some cases the balance between the activities of various
antiapoptotic and proapoptotic factors ultimately dictates
response to treatment.
It is important to emphasize that high levels of constitutively
activated STAT3 in skin biopsies and cell lines derived from CTCL
patients has been widely described (reviewed in refs. 1, 19).
Consistent with those reports, constitutive activation of STAT3
was evident across most of the skin biopsies examined. However,
our results indicate that there is a significant difference in the level
of activated STAT3 across the samples analyzed. In CTCL patients,
STAT3 activation has been in part attributed to production of Th2
cytokines by malignant T cells. In some cases, high levels of
interleukin 2 receptor-a chain (CD25) have also been implicated in
persistent STAT3 phosphorylation (22). Cytokine-independent
activation of STAT3 has also been reported in CTCL cell lines.
Future studies will help to address whether alterations in the
positive, activating signals, including ligands (cytokines) and
upstream kinases (JAKs), or defects in the activity or expression
of negative regulators of the kinases that activate STATs, like SHP-1
(51), correlate with the degree of STAT phosphorylation and
increased resistance to vorinostat in CTCL patients.
To gain understanding of the role of STATs as mediators of
resistance to vorinostat at the molecular level, we evaluated the
effect of blocking their activity in CTCL lines with poor vorinostat
response. HuT 78 and MJ cells were sensitized to vorinostat by

www.aacrjournals.org

coincubation with a JAK inhibitor. In addition, knockdown of
individual STAT proteins improved sensitivity to vorinostat in HuT
78 cells. The in vitro analysis suggests that constitutively activated
STATs are not only biomarkers of vorinostat resistance, but also are
functionally linked to poor response to this HDAC inhibitor. These
results also indicate that the synergistic inhibition of growth
induced by the vorinostat/JAKi combination correlates with the
decrease in expression of several antiapoptotic proteins that are
STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional targets. In the two CTCL lines
tested, vorinostat treatment did not alter acetylation or phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, or STAT5. In addition, in HuT 78 cells, the
DNA binding activity of STAT3 was not affected by vorinostat
(Supplementary Fig. S8). As previously mentioned, HDACs associated with STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 participate in chromatin
remodeling, modulate the activity of coregulators, and contribute to
recruit additional factors that enable transcription of a selective set
of genes. Together these events may affect local chromatin structure
and proper STAT transactivation. Therefore, these data are
consistent with a cooperative model, whereby the JAK inhibitor
mediates a decrease in STAT phosphorylation and vorinostat leads
to inhibition of their HDAC-associated activity, resulting in a
synergistic decrease in STAT-mediated gene transcription. One
implication from the in vitro studies presented is that inhibitors of
JAKs once clinically available may work well in combination with
vorinostat and help overcome resistance to apoptotic death in those
patients with constitutive STAT signaling.
Finally, signals triggered by an array of tyrosine kinases,
including receptor tyrosine kinases, Src and JAKs, activate STAT
proteins in various types of malignant cells. The mechanism of
STAT-mediated drug resistance is at least in part related to the
ability of these transcription factors to control the expression of
general prosurvival, antiapoptotic genes. Our results add to the
mounting evidence that constitutive activation of STATs may be
at the core of a general mechanism of resistance to cell death.
Additional studies will help to determine whether activated
STATs represent tumor intrinsic determinants of clinical
resistance for a broad spectrum of drugs and cancer types,
similar to overexpressed ATP-binding cassette transporters or
Bcl-2. Our in vitro analysis in B-cell and T-cell lymphoma lines
suggests that the relationship between constitutive STAT
activation and clinical response to vorinostat may not be limited
to CTCL. In addition, the similarity between the sensitivity of
CTCL lines to vorinostat and valproate suggests that activation
of STATs may also affect response to other HDAC inhibitors.
Further clinical experience with vorinostat will provide a more
detailed understanding of the role of STAT activation and
resistance to vorinostat.
