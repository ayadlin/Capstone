ABSTRACT
14-3-3 proteins play a pivotal role in controlling cell proliferation and survival,
two commonly dysregulated hallmarks of cancers. 14-3-3 protein expression is
enhanced in many human cancers and correlates with more aggressive tumors
and poor prognosis, suggesting a role for 14-3-3 proteins in tumorigenesis and/
or progression. We showed previously that the dimeric state of 14-3-3 proteins
is regulated by the lipid sphingosine, a physiological inducer of apoptosis. As the
functions of 14-3-3 proteins are dependent on their dimeric state, this sphingosinemediated 14-3-3 regulation provides a possible means to target dimeric 14-3-3 for
therapeutic effect. However, sphingosine mimics are needed that are not susceptible
to sphingolipid metabolism. We show here the identification and optimization of
sphingosine mimetics that render dimeric 14-3-3 susceptible to phosphorylation at
a site buried in the dimer interface and induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.
Two such compounds, RB-011 and RB-012, disrupt 14-3-3 dimers at low micromolar
concentrations and induce rapid down-regulation of Raf-MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling
in Jurkat cells. Importantly, both RB-011 and RB-012 induce apoptosis of human
A549 lung cancer cells and RB-012, through disruption of MAPK signaling, reduces
xenograft growth in mice. Thus, these compounds provide proof-of-principle for this
novel 14-3-3-targeting approach for anti-cancer drug discovery.

INTRODUCTION

Enhanced expression of 14-3-3 proteins has been
detected in many human cancers including lung [4],
head and neck [5], breast [6] and ovarian cancer [7] and
correlates with more aggressive tumors and poor prognosis
[8]. Over-expression of 14-3-3 isoforms has been shown to
contribute to neoplastic transformation by stimulating RafMAPK and PI3K signaling [9]. Down-regulation of 14-33ζ in head and neck cancer cells [10] and also lung cancer
cells [11] renders cells more sensitive to chemotherapy,
supporting the notion that cancer cells utilize mechanisms
that are 14-3-3 dependent. These experimental and clinical
observations suggest that 14-3-3 proteins represent an
addiction for many cancers and consequently are an

The family of 14-3-3 proteins plays a pivotal role
in integrating cellular survival signaling and thereby are
key players in determining the cell fate [1, 2]. Through
their role in binding multiple phospho-client proteins
within the cell, 14-3-3 proteins regulate many important
signaling events. In particular, 14-3-3 proteins maintain
the proliferative capacity of the cell by supporting the
efficient activation of the Raf-MAPK signaling cascade
and also support cell survival through the PI3K-AKT
signaling cascade [1, 2], key requirements of cancer cells
[3].

through a 14-3-3-mediated mechanism in vitro.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the most potent
of this chemical series induce mitochondrial-mediated
apoptosis at low micromolar concentrations in vitro
and rapidly elicit a signaling cascade that corresponds
kinetically to the disruption of dimeric 14-3-3 functions.
In a mouse xenograft model of human non-small cell
lung cancer where 14-3-3 is over-expressed, RB-012,
our most active compound significantly reduced tumor
growth without adverse effects on the animals. Our data
show that RB-012 is soluble, readily taken up by cells,
effective at low concentration and unlike other previously
reported 14-3-3-directed small molecules, acts via a
non-competitive mechanism. This compound and the
mechanism that underlies its activity provide proof-ofprinciple for our approach to developing a new class of
14-3-3-targeting small molecule therapeutics for cancer
treatment.

attractive target for anti-cancer therapy [8, 12].
In search of 14-3-3 inhibitors, several studies have
identified small molecules that function as mimics of 143-3 binding partners, blocking the interaction of 14-33 proteins with phospho-clients such as c-Abl [13] and
Raf-1 [14], and thus behaving as competitive antagonists.
These small molecule inhibitors of 14-3-3 proteins exhibit
anti-cancer activity in cell-based assays but are limited
by their specificity, ability to penetrate cells and also the
need for high concentrations to effectively compete with
abundant endogenous 14-3-3-binding proteins.
We have taken a novel approach to developing
14-3-3-targeting molecules by exploiting the requirement
of 14-3-3 proteins to function as dimers [15]. 14-3-3
proteins are intrinsically dimeric in nature, a characteristic
which is obligatory for many of their biological functions
[16]. We showed previously that the dimeric status of 143-3 proteins is subject to regulation, with the critical step
being phosphorylation of Ser58 (numbering relates to the
ζ isoform), a site otherwise buried in the dimer interface
[17]. The Ser58 dimer interface phosphorylation site is
conserved in five of the seven mammalian isoforms and is
recognized by several kinases [18-20] but, importantly, we
showed it only becomes accessible after the endogenous
lipid sphingosine binds to the 14-3-3 protein [15]. Once
Ser58 is phosphorylated, the dimeric structure of the 143-3 protein is disrupted and its function is inhibited [17].
Thus, through this mechanism, sphingosine serves as a key
regulator of dimeric 14-3-3 protein function and induces
apoptosis [15].
Similarly, we found that the synthetic sphingosine
analogue, FTY720, also renders 14-3-3 phosphorylatable
[15]. FTY720, also known as Fingolimod and GilenyaTM,
is in clinical use to induce immune suppression in the
treatment of multiple sclerosis, but has reported anti-cancer
characteristics in many experimental systems [21]. As an
immune suppressant, FTY720 is a pro-drug which relies
on conversion to a phosphorylated form for its effects,
predominantly as a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
antagonist [21]. The anti-cancer effects of FTY720
however are associated with the unphosphorylated prodrug form [21] and we have shown that these are mediated
in part by its effect on 14-3-3 proteins [15]. Owing to its
immunosuppressant properties, FTY720 is not a suitable
anti-cancer therapy but understanding the molecular basis
of its anti-cancer action has provided us with a rationale
to identify more sphingosine-like compounds that target
14-3-3 specifically.
We have now surveyed other sphingosine-like
molecules and demonstrate that N-alkylated trimethyl
ammonium (TMA) molecules act as sphingo-mimics
to disrupt 14-3-3 dimers and induce apoptosis in Jurkat
cells. Because these compounds are unsuitable drug
candidates, we have combined the chemical nature of the
TMAs with the FTY720 backbone to generate a novel
chemical series that exhibit apoptotic characteristics

RESULTS
Trimethylammonium compounds render the 14-33 dimer interface accessible to kinases and induce
mitochondrial apoptosis
We previously established that non-acylated
sphingolipids with a net positive charge are capable of
rendering 14-3-3 phosphorylatable [15]. To identify
new compounds that are capable of rendering 14-3-3
phosphorylatable but are not susceptible to sphingolipid
metabolism, we assessed non-sphingoid cationic lipids
such as quaternary ammonium compounds for effects on
14-3-3 phosphorylatability. In our in vitro system using
recombinant 14-3-3ζ as substrate and PKA catalytic
subunit as the phosphorylating enzyme, we found that
trimethylammonium (TMA) molecules with an alkyl chain
of 14 carbons or longer rendered 14-3-3 phosphorylatable,
whereas molecules with a shorter alkyl chain were
ineffective (Figure 1A & 1B).
We next tested whether the N-alkyl TMA
series could induce cell death of Jurkat cells. Cell
death was assessed using flow cytometry after 20 h
of treatment by analysis of cell viability together with
tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) staining to
monitor mitochondrial permeability transition (∆ΨM),
an event commonly associated with programmed cell
death (Figure 1C). The longer chain N-alkyl TMA
molecules induced mitochondrial permeability transition
at 5µM, consistent with their ability to render 14-3-3
phosphorylatable. This suggests that like sphingosine,
these longer chain TMA molecules can regulate dimeric
14-3-3 proteins to disrupt their functions in cells.
To elucidate the mechanism of the TMA compound’s
effect on 14-3-3 protein, we carried out dose-response

studies with C16-TMA, (cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide, denoted as CTAB) in 14-3-3 phosphorylation
reactions. We observed a dose-dependent increase in 143-3 Ser58 phosphorylation with increasing concentration
of CTAB (Figure 2A) and using recombinant S58A 143-3ζ protein, confirmed that Ser58 was the only site
phosphorylated by PKA (Figure 2A), consistent with our
previous studies with sphingosine, and FTY720 [15].
Additionally, we observed no effect of CTAB on PKA
catalytic subunit activity (as determined using kemptide
phosphorylation) over the same concentration range (data
not shown), reinforcing that CTAB has a direct effect on
the 14-3-3 protein, not on enzyme activity.
Long chain N-alkylated TMA molecules are

amphiphilic with a cationic head group and a long alkyl
chain and can therefore behave as cationic detergents. The
reported critical micelle concentration for CTAB in water
is 1 mM but in 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.0, 10 mM NaCl the
CMC decreases to ~ 0.15 mM [25]. We therefore assessed
CTAB’s effect on 14-3-3 phosphorylation more closely
to determine whether non-specific denaturation of 14-3-3
was contributing to the phosphorylatability of 14-3-3 by
PKA. In extended dose-response studies, CTAB induced
14-3-3 phosphorylation at low micromolar concentrations,
plateauing at 25 µM, but above 75 µM a further increase
in 14-3-3 phosphorylation was observed (Figure 2B). This
implies that at low micromolar concentrations, CTAB
binds discrete sites in 14-3-3, thereby conformationally

altering the dimer interface to reveal the Ser58
phosphorylation site accessible to PKA, whereas at
higher concentrations of CTAB, approaching CMC
values, a more cooperative effect is seen, consistent with
generalized protein denaturation. Consistent with this,
PKA catalytic subunit activity was significantly inhibited

at higher CTAB concentrations (Figure 2B, kemptide
phosphorylation was reduced by 90% in the presence of
100 µM CTAB compared with vehicle alone) presumably
due to the denaturation of the enzyme. Similar effects
have been observed for C14-TMA binding to bovine serum
albumin, with saturable binding to specific high affinity

To test whether the mitochondrial permeability
transition induced by CTAB is associated with apoptosis,
akin to the effect of sphingosine and FTY720 [15], we
examined caspase-3 activation, a characteristic marker
of apoptosis. As shown in Figure 2C, CTAB does induce
caspase-3 activation in Jurkat cells and, as with FTY720
[27], Jurkat cells over-expressing Bcl-2 were protected
from CTAB-induced cell death, confirming that the
CTAB-induced apoptosis is mediated by the mitochondria.
Thus, these data show that at concentrations well below

changes at the dimer interface and thereby allowing
kinases access to the Ser58 phosphorylation site. CTAB
however, is not an ideal anti-cancer candidate owing to
its strong detergent properties and known toxic effects in
mice. Data generated by the Developmental Therapeutics
Program at the National Cancer Institute indicate that
CTAB is toxic in mice when dosed above 10 mg/kg over
a five day treatment, (mined from < http://dtp.nci.nih.
gov/dtpstandard/dwindex/index.jsp>). The clinical drug
FTY720 has previously been used in mice at 10 mg/kg
with no reported adverse effects, although its clinical
application is as an immunosuppressant, an activity
associated with the phosphorylated form of FTY720
[21]. In order to generate more 14-3-3-selective agents
we sought to combine the charged quaternary ammonium
group of the TMA molecules with the clinically approved
FTY720 alkyl chain, and thereby generated a panel of
new quaternary amine derivatives of FTY720, denoted

here as RB-011, -012, -066, -067 and -068 (Figure 3A).
Unlike sphingosine and FTY720, these analogues lack
hydroxyl sites for phosphorylation by sphingosine kinases
and therefore cannot be converted to immunosuppressive
phospho-species.
Initially we tested the five RB compounds in our
in vitro 14-3-3 phosphorylation assay. In dose response
studies we found RB-011 and RB-012 were the most
effective at rendering 14-3-3 phosphorylatable by PKA,
whereas the other compounds were much less effective
(Figure 3A). We then assessed the ability of the RB
compounds to induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells compared
with FTY720, CTAB and RB-015 [22], a hydroxylated
version of RB-012 (in which the hydroxyl group is at the
4 position of the piperidinium ring, ref. 22). At 5 µM,
RB-011 and -012 were readily able to activate apoptosis
as determined by caspase-3 activation within 5 h (Figure
3B), and Annexin V presentation and loss of viability at

24 h (Figure 3C), consistent with their ability to elicit 143-3 phosphorylation at low concentration. Importantly
RB-011 and -012 were more potent than either CTAB
or FTY720. None of the other RB compounds were as
effective at inducing Jurkat cell apoptosis consistent with
their effect on 14-3-3 phosphorylation and indicating that
ring substitution is not tolerated for these activities (Figure
3).
The potency and apoptotic effects of RB-011 and
-012 on cells were examined more closely. We determined
the ED50 for apoptosis induction in Jurkat cells by
assessing the activation of caspase-3 at 5 h, before any
significant loss of cell viability (Figure 3B). RB-012 was
slightly more potent than RB-011 at initiating apoptosis,
with an ED50 of 2 µM compared with 3 µM for RB-011

(Figure 4A). Biochemical characterization of RB-treated
Jurkat cells revealed that after 4 h of treatment PARP
cleavage had occurred, consistent with the commitment
to apoptosis (Figure 4B, upper panels). Using phosphospecific antibodies, we detected active stress-activated
protein kinases, p38 and JNK, after 4 h of treatment with
RB-011 or -012 (Figure 4B, second and third panel).
Immunoblotting of 14-3-3 revealed a slightly lower
molecular weight form of 14-3-3 after 4 h of RB-011
or -012 treatment (Figure 4B, bottom panel) probably
associated with caspase cleavage as 14-3-3 proteins have
previously been shown to be susceptible [28].
These analyses indicate that the activation of
apoptosis in response to the RB compounds is rapid,
and detectable by 4 h of treatment. Additionally and

importantly, over-expression of Bcl-2 completely
protected the Jurkat cells from the RB compounds (Figure
4C) as determined by analysis of viability and caspase
activation after 20 h of treatment, confirming that the
compounds initiate signaling upstream of mitochondrialmediated apoptosis.

First, we performed survival assays using MTS
and found that the RB compounds reduced cell viability
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A). As with the
Jurkat cells, RB-012 was slightly more potent than RB011 with an IC50 of 5.5 µM compared with 7 µM for
RB-011 (Figure 6A). We assessed the ability of the RB
compounds to induce A549 cells apoptosis by monitoring
caspase-3 activation. Both compounds induced caspase-3
activation with RB-012 showing greater potency at 10 µM
(Figure 6B). The compounds were then tested for their
effect on A549 colony formation in soft agar, a measure
of neoplastic growth. Both compounds reduced colony
formation in a dose-dependent manner with RB-012 again
showing slightly greater potency (Figure 6C).
A549 cells harbor oncogenic K-Ras and
consequently constitutive MAPK signaling is
characteristic of this cell line. We analyzed the effect of
RB-012 on MAPK signaling in the A549 cells in vitro and
observed a rapid reduction in phospho-ERK in response
to RB-012 (Figure 6D). Thus given RB-012’s activity in
vitro, we then studied its effects in vivo.
To assess any potential toxicity, BALB/c nude mice
were administered either RB-012 or FTY720, delivered in
saline (0.9%), daily by i.p. injection at 5mg/kg or 10mg/
kg body weight, doses previously reported for FTY720
administration [21]. Over a course of 28 days there were
no adverse effects associated with RB-012 treatment with
the exception of apparent pain and abdominal cramping
in the mice immediately after injection which subsided
within 10-20 min. Similar effects were also observed
with 5mg/kg/day FTY720 treatment. Importantly
there was no pathology associated with the abdominal
cramping suggesting a physiological response and over
time the mice developed a tolerance to this effect. The
body weight of RB-012 treated mice was unaltered over
the course of the toxicity study and histology of tissues
(liver, lung, kidney, heart and spleen) collected during the
treatment course was unaffected (supplementary Figure
2A) indicating that the RB-012 had no major toxic effects.
Additionally, bone marrow samples from RB-012 treated
mice exhibited no alterations indicating no changes in
steady state haemopoiesis (supplementary Figure 2B). In
the same toxicity study we found that FTY720 dosed at
10mg/kg body weight was poorly tolerated and caused
cardiac arrhythmia with one unexplained fatality. Toxicity
has previously been noted with i.p. injection of FTY720
at 10mg/kg/day [30] and we were therefore unable to use
this dose of FTY720 in the subsequent xenograft study.
To assess the effect of RB-012 on human lung
cancer growth in vivo, A549 cells were implanted
subcutaneously on the flanks of BALB/c nude mice and
tumors were allowed to grow until they had reached a
volume of 100 mm3. RB-012, FTY720 or saline was then
administered daily to assess the effect on tumor growth.
Owing to the physiological abdominal cramping response
observed in the toxicity study, we were required on ethical

The novel RB sphingomimetics cause rapid
inhibition of PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling
To characterize the signaling changes associated
with RB treatment of Jurkat cells, we carried out timecourse studies using RB-012 and prepared cytosolic
extracts for immunoblotting. Strikingly, phospho-specific
antibodies revealed rapid dephosphorylation of both ERK
and AKT (within 1 h) upon RB-012 treatment (Figure
5A first and third panels), indicating down-regulation of
the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways respectively.
Activation of SAPKs p38 and JNK was detected but not
until 2 h post RB-012 treatment (Figure 5A fourth and fifth
panels), after ERK and AKT inactivation.
In the same time-course studies, apoptotic markers
were analyzed by immunoblotting. BID cleavage is
associated with diverse apoptotic stimuli and has been
shown to occur after mitochondrial permeability transition
and apoptotic commitment via a caspase-3 mediated
process in Jurkat cells [29]. We analyzed BID cleavage
after RB-12 treatment and found that BID breakdown
is detected at 3 h of RB-012 treatment (Figure 5B, first
panel). Immunoblotting for 14-3-3 over the time-course
revealed that the lower molecular weight form of 14-33 protein is detected at 2 h (Figure 5B, second panel),
consistent with activation of caspase-3 (Figure 5B, third
panel). Additionally, PARP cleavage was detectable at 2 h
(Figure 5B, fourth panel). Thus commitment to apoptosis
in response to RB-012 occurs within 2-3 h of treatment,
after the initial effects on MAPK and PI3K signaling.

RB sphingomimetics inhibit A549 lung cancer cell
growth in vitro and in vivo
RB-011 and -012 exhibit apoptotic activity on
Jurkat cells. Their effects are mediated at least in part by
disruption of functional 14-3-3 dimers and inactivation of
AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. These characteristics
are desirable for a new anti-cancer therapy. We therefore
sought to validate these compounds on human cancer
cells where 14-3-3 over-expression has been implicated
in tumor aggression. Of the multiple cancer types where
14-3-3 over-expression has been detected, non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) has been identified as a cancer in
which the degree of 14-3-3ζ over-expression correlates
strongly with poor patient survival and disease severity
[4]. We therefore assessed the effect of the RB-011 and
-012 molecules on the NSCLC line A549 (Figure 6).

grounds to use a dose escalation regime for administering
both RB-012 and FTY720 to allow the mice to develop
tolerance. Initially, dosing was limited to 2mg/kg body
weight for two days and then increased to 5mg/kg daily
for two weeks which minimized the cramping. Tumor
volume was monitored twice a week and after two weeks
of dosing at 5mg/kg body weight, mice administered RB012 had tumors that were 20% smaller than mice receiving
saline (Figure 6E). Interestingly, mice receiving FTY720
showed no reduction in tumor size (Figure 6E) in contrast
to a previous report employing A549 xenografts [31] albeit
in a different mouse strain (Balb/c SCID) and using a
different route of FTY720 administration (by oral gavage).
As RB-012 was better tolerated than FTY720, the
dosing of RB-012 treated mice was increased to 10mg/
kg body weight for a further week with no adverse effects
on the mice. The tumors on the RB-012-treated mice
continued to grow more slowly than those on saline treated
mice and at the end of the treatment course were 30%
smaller than those of saline-treated mice (Figure 6E). Thus
RB-012 effectively reduced A549 tumor growth whereas
FTY720 was ineffective in this study.
To provide evidence that the anti-cancer effect of
RB-012 in the A549 xenograft study involved disruption
of dimeric 14-3-3, we analyzed the excised tumor tissue
for MAPK activity. Quantitative immunofluorescence
analysis showed that tumors treated with RB-012 had
significantly less phospho-ERK than saline-treated tumors
(Figure 6F), consistent with the in vitro results on A549
cells (Figure 6D). Thus RB-012 effectively reduces A549
xenograft growth by a mechanism involving disruption
of the oncogenic signaling in these cells, supporting the
notion that RB-012 reduces tumor growth by disruption
of dimeric 14-3-3 function.

determining the effect on 14-3-3 modulation and Jurkat
cell apoptosis. Long-chain TMAs have the greatest
potency both in in vitro 14-3-3 phosphorylation assay
and inducing Jurkat cell apoptosis (Figure 1). We have
demonstrated that at low micromolar concentrations
(below the CMC), CTAB modulates 14-3-3ζ, allowing
phosphorylation by PKA at Ser58 in the dimer interface,
in an analogous fashion to sphingosine and its analogues
[15]. Additionally, the long-chain TMAs induce apoptosis
in Jurkat cells at concentrations well below CMC via the
mitochondrial pathway (Figure 2). These data support
the notion that long-chain TMAs induce apoptosis by
interfering with dimeric 14-3-3 in the cell.
CTAB was previously identified in a highthroughput screen for anti-cancer agents as being able
to inhibit the growth of a panel of head and neck cancer
(HNC) cell lines and reduce mitochondrial membrane
potential (∆ΨM) but the mechanism of action was unknown
[33]. Consistent with our results, the apoptotic effect of
CTAB was related to the length of the alkyl group [33].
Furthermore, CTAB administration at 5 mg/kg retarded
the growth of HNC xenografts in vivo [33]. 14-3-3ζ overexpression has been reported in HNCs and correlates
with poor patient prognosis [5] and knock-down of 14-33ζ in HNC cell lines by RNAi inhibited cell growth and
increased apoptosis in response to chemotherapy [10]. Our
results strongly suggest that the effects of CTAB on HNC
lines are attributable to 14-3-3 dimer disruption.
CTAB has also been assessed for anti-cancer
activity in the National Cancer Institute Developmental
Therapeutics Program (<www.dtp.nci.nih.gov>) in
mouse cancer models of lymphocytic leukemia (P388
and L1210) and melanoma (B16). A modest therapeutic
effect was seen in the P388 model at low doses, at 3 and
6 mg/kg body weight per day i.p. 20 % more of the mice
survived to 30 days of treatment compared with untreated
controls. At high dose (>10 mg/kg body weight) CTAB
was toxic (after 5 days treatment, data extracted from DTP
at NCI) and given its strong surfactant properties is not
suitable as a drug candidate. However, CTAB’s ability
to disrupt 14-3-3 dimers, allowing phosphorylation in
the dimer interface, coincident with its ability to induce
mitochondrial apoptosis and experimental anti-cancer
activity, provide initial validation for our strategy to
identify compounds with 14-3-3-dimer disrupting activity
as potential anti-cancer agents.
In the present study we designed a series of new
compounds that combine the quaternary ammonium
group of the alkylated TMA molecules with the backbone
of FTY720. The compounds exhibit varying ability to
render 14-3-3 phosphorylatable in vitro coinciding with
their ability to induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells (Figure 3).
In particular RB-011 and RB-012 have a potent ability to
induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells within 4 h of treatment
and have ED50 values in the low micromolar range (Figure
4). Time-course studies revealed rapid inactivation of

DISCUSSION
The widespread over-expression of 14-3-3 proteins
in human tumors has highlighted the significance of 14-33 proteins in cancer development [4-8]. Increased 14-3-3
expression provides cancer cells with enhanced protection
against apoptotic mediators making 14-3-3 proteins an
attractive target for anti-cancer drug development. Several
groups have identified molecules with the ability to block
the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to client proteins [13, 14,
32]. Without exception these molecules compete with
client proteins for binding in the amphipathic groove [32].
We have developed a novel approach that exploits discrete
sphingolipid binding site(s) on 14-3-3 that when occupied,
causes dimer disruption and loss of function [15].
We
have
now
identified
N-alkylated
trimethylammonium (TMA) molecules as modulators of
14-3-3 in vitro with a corresponding capacity to induce
apoptosis of Jurkat cells (Figure 1). From a chemical
series of trimethylammonium compounds we determined
that the length of the alkyl chain is an important factor in

ERK and AKT signaling within 1 h of treatment of Jurkat
cells with RB-012, followed by activation of SAPKs,
JNK and p38 by 2 h (Figure 5A). The apoptotic cascade
then proceeds with caspase-3 processing, PARP and BID
cleavage (Figure 5B). These are important findings that
reveal the cellular effects of RB-012 occur in a timedependent manner with primary effects on cell signaling
occurring prior to apoptotic commitment.
14-3-3 proteins are known to play a key role in
integrating survival signaling within the cell [1-2].
When mutant forms of 14-3-3 that are non-competent
for phospho-client binding are expressed in cells they
heterodimerise with endogenous isoforms and act as
functionally monomeric proteins, causing disruption of
MAPK signaling and activation of SAPK [34, 35]. These
effects phenocopy what we have observed with RB-012,
and match the known differential regulation of upstream
MAPK Raf-1 [36] and SAPKK, ASK-1 [37] and MEKK2
[38] by dimeric 14-3-3 proteins. Additionally, recent
studies have confirmed that 14-3-3 proteins are required
for PI3K activity [39]. The downstream inactivation
of AKT signaling in response to RB-012 is therefore
entirely consistent with 14-3-3’s role in PI3K function.
Our studies reveal that targeting 14-3-3 proteins using
our sphingomimetic approach provides a potent means to
disrupt functional 14-3-3 dimers which is desirable for an
effective anti-cancer drug.
Several isoforms of 14-3-3 have been associated
with the transformed phenotype, both experimentally;
over-expression of 14-3-3γ, β and ζ have been shown to
cause cellular transformation [9, 40, 41], and in clinical
samples (ζ, β, ε, γ, η and τ) [4-8]. However, the 14-3-3ζ
isoform is the most commonly up-regulated in cancer
[4-8]. This may be due to a specific role for the zeta
isoform although to date none are known. More likely,
the specific regulation of 14-3-3ζ expression by a microRNA (miR-) 451 may be the underlying cause [42]. The
negative regulation of 14-3-3ζ by miR-451 has been
elegantly demonstrated in breast cancer cells where it
was shown that tamoxifen treatment leads to loss of miR451 expression and up-regulation of 14-3-3ζ, correlating
with increased disease severity [42]. Intriguingly, miR451 expression has also been shown to be low in NSCLC
tissue compared with non-cancerous lung tissue, and upregulation of miR-451 in A549 cells reduced cell growth
and increased the cells susceptibility to cisplatin [43].
These results mirror the over-expression 14-3-3ζ seen in
NSCLC tissue which correlates with disease severity, and
similarly targeted knock-down of 14-3-3ζ using RNAi in
A549 cells also increased the cells sensitivity to cisplatin
[4]. Thus the reciprocal expression of miR-451 and 143-3ζ may be important prognostic markers for disease
severity and cancer progression in NSCLC.
As 14-3-3ζ expression is closely linked with
NSCLC disease, we tested RB-011 and RB-012 for anticancer effects on NSCLC A549 cells. We found that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these compounds inhibited A549 cell survival and colony
formation in soft-agar and induced apoptosis (Figure 6).
14-3-3ζ knock-down in A549 cells has previously been
shown to reduce colony formation and increase anoikis
(apoptosis induced by loss of cell adhesion) [11]. We also
demonstrated the therapeutic potential of RB-012 in an
in vivo A549-xenograft model (Figure 6) and showed
that RB-012 reduces tumor growth by up to 30% over a
three week course of treatment. The compound was well
tolerated with fewer side effects than FTY720, which
did not elicit a reduction in tumor growth. FTY720 has
previously been demonstrated to reduce tumor growth
in other experimental cancer models [21] but at higher
doses (10 mg/kg/day), suggesting that the RB-012 is more
potent. FTY720 is readily converted to a phospho-form
by an endogenous sphingosine kinase (SK), and in this
form acts as a sphingosine-1-phosphate analogue which
mediates the drug’s immunosuppressive action. RB-012
cannot be phosphorylated as it lacks a phosphate accepting
hydroxyl group and unlike FTY720, does not affect SK
activity [22]. Therefore compared to FTY720, RB-012
has a more selective anti-cancer action. Compared with
other 14-3-3-directed small molecules [13, 14 & 32],
the RB compounds shown here are non-competitive
in that they do not compete with endogenous phosphoclients for binding in the amphipathic groove. These data
provide valuable proof-of-principle for our 14-3-3 dimer
disruption approach to cancer drug discovery.

PKA activity assays
Reactions were essentially identical to 14-3-3
phosphorylation assays except that 50 µM kemptide
substrate was added in place of 14-3-3 protein. After
incubation at 37°C for 15 minutes the reactions were
spotted onto phosphocellulose filters (Whatman P81).
Filters were washed 5 times in 0.75% phosphoric acid and
once in acetone before liquid scintillation counting.

Cell lines and culture
Jurkat E6.1 cells were obtained from the ATCC
and verified by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis in
December 2014. The A549 cell line was purchased
from ECACC in April 2012 (which also performs STR
verification) and used within 6 months of resuscitation
in the studies presented here. Jurkat cells were routinely
cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and A549 cells in DMEM
with 10% FBS at 37ºC with 5% CO2. Jurkat Bcl-2 cells
were generated by lentiviral transduction using a third
generation lentiviral construct as described previously
[15] containing a Bcl-2α-IRES-IL2Rα encoding cassette.
Transduced cells were FACS sorted for expression of
IL2Rα using anti-CD25-PE (BD Pharmingen, #555433)
(Supplementary Figure 1A) to enrich for Bcl-2 overexpressing cells, and protein expression was further
confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-2 antibody
(BD Transduction Laboratories, #610538) (Supplementary
Figure 1B).

8-Methyl-8-(4-octylphenethyl)-1,4-dioxa-8azoniaspiro[4.5]decane methanesulfonate (RB-068)
To a solution of 4-octylphenethyl methanesulfonate
(10 mg, 0.032 mmol) in 3 mL of acetonitrile was added
8-methyl-1,4-dioxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane (100 mg, 0.64

Apoptosis assays: TMRE, Caspase 3 and Annexin
V
Jurkat cells were routinely set up in apoptosis assays
at 2 x 105/ml in RPMI with 0.5% FBS. After treatment,
cells were stained either with 200 nM TMRE, 5 µl/ml
NucViewTM (Biotium), or Annexin V-FITC (Roche) for
15 min prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Forward- and
side-scatter properties were used to exclude debris and a
‘viable’ gate corresponding to the intact PI negative cell
population was used for fluorescence analysis. For A549,
cells at 90% confluency were treated with the compounds
for 48h in DMEM with 0.5% FBS. After treatment,
cells were released with trypsin and then stained with
NucViewTM prior to analysis by flow cytometry.

14-3-3 phosphorylation assays
Substrate 14-3-3 (0.5 μg of purified recombinant 143-3) was added to 15 μl of reaction mixture comprising
0.2U of the PKA catalytic subunit, in the presence or
absence of compounds (delivered in 0.1% v/v ethanol) in
PKA reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 15 mM
MgCl2, 3 mM DTT containing 25 μM ATP and 0.3 μCi
[32P] γ-ATP). Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 15 min.
After incubation, reactions were separated on 12.5% SDSPAGE and Coomassie stained. 14-3-3 phosphorylation was
analyzed using a Typhoon Phosphorimager and quantified

Assessment of A549 cell viability by MTS assay
A549 cells (2500/well) were plated in 96-well trays
in DMEM with 0.5% FBS and cultured at 37ºC with 5%
CO2 overnight. The following day RB compounds were

added and the cells were incubated for a further 48 h
prior to removal of the medium and replacement with
MTS reagent (Promega) diluted 1:6 in Dulbecco’s PBS.
The cells were incubated at 37ºC for a further 4 h and the
conversion of MTS to the colored formazan compound
was determined by measurement of absorbance at 490 nM.

All experimental procedures involving animals were
conducted in accordance with the NHMRC Australian
Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific
Purposes and with approval by the institutional animal
ethics committee. BALB/c nude mice (Nu/Nu, female, 5-6
weeks old) were purchased from the Animal Resources
Centre (Perth, WA) and maintained under pathogen-free
conditions.
Toxicity studies were carried out with both RB-012
and FTY720 (in 0.9% saline) at 5 and 10 mg/kg body
weight, administered daily by intraperitoneal injection and
mice were monitored over a 28 day treatment course. Five
mice were used per group for RB-012 treatment and three
mice per group for FTY720 treatment.
For xenograft studies, A549 cells (5 x 106) in 100 µl
of PBS were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of the
mice and the resulting tumors were measured using digital
calipers. The tumor volume was calculated using the
following formula: Volume = (larger diameter) x (small
diameter)2/2. Once the tumors had reached 100 mm3,
mice were divided into groups of 9 and to each group
was administered with either RB-012, FTY720 (in 0.9%
saline) or saline by intraperitoneal injection daily. Initially,
RB-012 and FTY720 were administered at 2 mg/kg body
weight for two days and then the dose was increased to 5
mg/kg body weight for two weeks, after which RB-012
was increased to 10 mg/kg body weight but FTY720 was
maintained at 5 mg/kg body weight. During this dosing
regime tumors were monitored twice a week. Differences
between samples were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA and
statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

A549 colony assay
A549 cells (7500) were plated in 0.33% low-melting
point agarose in DMEM with 10 % FBS with and without
RB compounds over a 0.5% low-melting point agarose
base. Cells were incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 for 14
days and then colonies were photographed and analyzed
using Image J.

Immunoblotting
Jurkat cells were treated at 5 x 105/ml in RPMI
with 0.5% FBS as detailed. Jurkat cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 min and washed with
PBS prior to lysis in homogenization buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 %
glycerol, protease inhibitor (Roche), 4 mM NaF, 2 mM
sodium vanadate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium molybdate) for
15 minutes on ice followed by three rounds of freezethawing. For treatment A549 cells were plated in 10 cm
dishes and treated when they reached approximately 75 %
confluence in DMEM with 0.5% FBS. Cells were scraped
from the dish and collected by centrifugation at 1500 g
and washed with PBS prior to lysis in homogenization
buffer as detailed above.
All lysates were clarified at 13,000 rpm for 20
minutes at 4°C and protein concentration was determined
using the BCA assay (Pierce). Thirty to forty µg of lysate
were run on Criterion-XT 4-12 % Bis-Tris gels (Bio-Rad),
followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose. The filters were
blocked for 30 min at room temperature in TNT buffer (10
mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 % Tween-20)
containing blocking buffer (Roche), prior to incubation
with antibodies over night. Antibodies used were from
Cell Signaling Technology; phospho-p38 MAPK (#4571),
phospho-SAPK/JNK (81E11), phospho- ERK (#9101),
phospho-AKT S473 (#9271), ERK (#9102), AKT (#9272),
BID (#2002), caspase-3 (#9602), PARP (#9542), and
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; pan 14-3-3 K19 (sc-629) .
After antibody binding, filters were washed in TNT for 1h
at room temperature, incubated with 1/12,500 anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody (Pierce) for 1h at
room temperature and finally washed for 1 hr with TNT
before incubation with Clarity western ECL reagent (BioRad). Filters were exposed on a LAS 4000 imager. Blots
were analyzed using Multi-gauge/Colony software FUJI
FILM.

Tissue preparation and analysis
At the end of the treatment courses, mice were
euthanized and tissues were collected and fixed in
neutral-buffered formalin for 12 hrs at 4°C. Tissues were
processed by embedding in paraffin and cutting into 4
µm sections. Sections were dewaxed and rehydrated
and the antigen retrieved by boiling for 20 minutes in
10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) under pressure (65 kPa
above atmospheric pressure). Sections were blocked
with 10 % goat serum in PBS (pH 7.4) solution for 30
minutes and incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-ERK
(1:100 diluted; CST #9101) at 4°C overnight. Sections
were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1 %
Tween and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated
to Alexa Fluor-488 (1:400 diluted; Invitrogen) at room
temperature for one hour. Sections were washed as before
and mounted in vectashield hard-set mounting medium
