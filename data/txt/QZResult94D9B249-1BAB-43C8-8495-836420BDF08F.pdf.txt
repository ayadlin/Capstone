ABSTRACT
Background: Several recent randomized clinical trials have preliminarily
demonstrated that initial targeted therapy with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is
more effective in metastatic melanoma (MM) than single agent. To guide therapeutic
decisions, we did a comprehensive network meta-analysis to identify evidence to
robustly support whether combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is the best initial
targeted therapeutic strategy for patients with MM.
Methods: The databases of PubMed and trial registries were researched for
randomized clinical trials of targeted therapy. Data of outcome were extracted on
progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and overall survival
(OS). Network meta-analysis using a Bayesian statistical model was performed to
evaluate relative hazard ratio (HR) for PFS and OS, odds ratio (OR) for ORR.
Results: Finally, 16 eligible trials comprising 5976 participants were included
in this meta-analysis. PFS were significantly prolonged in patients who received
combined BRAF-MEK inhibition compared with those who received BRAF inhibition
(HR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.51-0.67, P < 0.0001) or MEK inhibition alone (HR: 0.29, 95%CI:
0.22-0.37, P < 0.0001). Combined BRAF-MEK inhibition also improved the OS over
BRAF inhibition (HR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.56-0.81, P < 0.0001) or MEK inhibition alone
(HR: 0.48, 95%CI: 0.36-0.65, P < 0.0001). The ORR was superior in combined BRAF
and MEK inhibition comparing with BRAF inhibition (OR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.66-2.44, P
< 0.0001) or MEK inhibition alone (OR: 20.66, 95%CI: 12.22-35.47, P < 0.0001).
Conclusions: This study indicates that concurrent inhibition of BRAF and MEK
improved the most effective therapeutic modality as compared as single BRAF or MEK
inhibition for patients with MM.

RESULTS

(eg.V600E, V600K) opens a new era in targeted therapy
for MM. Indeed, the potent and specific BRAF (eg.
dabrafenib, vemurafenib and sorafenib) inhibition, as
compared with chemotherapy, have provided considerable
clinical benefits including progression-free survival
(PFS), overall survival (OS) and objective response
rate (ORR) in patients with MM [1, 2]. However, most
patients relapsed about 7 months after targeted therapy
and approximately 14-26% of patients have development
of secondary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and
hyperkeratotic lesions within the first 2-3 months after
BRAF inhibition [3]. Mechanism of acquired resistance
commonly involves reactive MAPK pathway through
mutant BRAF amplification and mutations activating
RAS and MEK [4]. Therefore, downstream MAPK
inhibition, such as MEK inhibition, was recognized as
a promising target option. In fact, MEK inhibition (eg.
trametinib) improved overall survival of MM patients
with BRAF V600 mutation and not previously treated
with BRAF inhibitors compared with chemotherapy [5]. In
addition, the cutaneous adverse effects, such as cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma resulted by BRAF-inhibitorâ€“
induced paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in
keratinocytes with upstream activation of signaling by
preexisting RAS mutations [6, 7] , which can be blocked
with the addition of a MEK inhibition. Thus, combinative
targeting the MAPK pathway via BRAF and MEK seem
to provide greater clinical efficacy and reduce the adverse
effects compared with BRAF inhibition alone.
Concurrent targeting BRAF and MEK has been
considered the possibility to enhance tumor growth
inhibition, delay acquired resistance, and abrogate
paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in preclinical
models of melanoma [6]. Recently several randomized
controlled trials are on the way to evaluate efficacy of
combined BRAF and MEK inhibition, such as the BRAF
inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibition trametinib,
have demonstrated superior response rate and prolonged
survival [8-11]. However, the optimum treatment remains
controversial and the feedback is not encouraged in term of
the modestly enhanced, therapeutic efficacy [12]. In other
way, it is difficult to integrate information on the relative
efficacy compared with other combination treatments such
as BRAF-chemotherapy, MEK-chemotherapy, and MEK
alone. To establish the optimum treatment for MM, we
did a random-effects network meta-analysis to compare
combined BRAF and MEK inhibition in term of PFS, OS
and ORR, respectively.

Eligible trials
We identified 451 relevant references for review
title and abstract. After initial screening, we retrieved
the full text of 32 potentially eligible clinical trials for
detailed assessment. Of these, 22 randomized controlled
trials were evaluated in more detail, and 18 randomized
controlled trials with phase II or III were found that met
the eligibility criteria for this study. Finally, 16 eligible
trials reporting randomized controlled trials were included
for meta-analysis, with a total of 5976 patients randomized
to receive two of the six treatment strategies [1, 2, 5,
8-11, 13-21]. Figure 1 depicted the flow diagram of the
systematic literature search and selection of random
control trials. The characteristics of the 16 included trials
were summarized in the Table 1. Six strategies were
included: combined BRAF and MEK inhibition, combined
BRAF inhibition and chemotherapy, combined MEK
inhibition and chemotherapy, BRAF inhibition alone,
MEK inhibition alone and chemotherapy alone. Figure 2
showed all the comparisons analyzed within the network.
Across the 16 trials, BRAF mutant patients accounted for
64.45% (3851/5976).

Progress-free survival (PFS)
Data on PFS were available in fifteen studies, and
HR values were explicitly reported in those studies. We
summarized the results of our random-effects network
meta-analysis for PFS in Figure 3A. Combined BRAFMEK inhibition improved significant prolonged PFS, as
compared with BRAF inhibition (HR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.510.67, P < 0.0001) or MEK inhibition alone (HR: 0.29,
95%CI: 0.22-0.37, P < 0.0001), respectively. The network
graph and forest plot of traditional pair-wise direct
comparison were drawn to graphically display the results
of the available direct comparisons between treatments.
Comparing results from traditional pairwise meta-analysis
(Figure 4A) and network meta-analysis did not suggest
inconsistency between direct and indirect evidences. The
network meta-analysis showed a statistically significant
advantage for BRAF inhibition as compared with MEK
inhibition (HR: 0.53, 95CI%: 0.42-0.68, P < 0.0001).

Overall survival (OS)
Total 15 trials, with enrolled patients, contributed to
our analysis of OS. As shown in Figure 3B, the ranking
probabilities of treatment from the network meta-analysis
of OS indicated that, of the 6 therapeutic strategies,
combined BRAF-MEK inhibition had the highest

Combined BRAF-MEK inhibition improved significant

Whereas, these results demonstrated that single BRAF
inhibition had a statistically significantly longer in OS than
MEK inhibition alone (HR: 0.72, 95%CI: 0.56-0.91, P =
0.008), and combined BRAF inhibition and chemotherapy
(HR: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.47-0.73, P < 0.0001). This finding

P < 0.0001) or MEK inhibition alone (OR: 20.66, 95%CI:

yielded better response rate than MEK inhibition alone
(OR: 10.34, 95%CI: 6.23-17.60, P < 0.0001).Values of

(SUCRA, Figure 5) indicated that combined BRAF and
MEK inhibition had the highest probability of being the
best treatment arm for ORR (SUCRA = 1.00), followed
by BRAF inhibition alone (SUCRA = 0.80), and combined

Objective response rate (ORR)
Total 15 studies including patients contributed
to the analysis of objective response rate (ORR). In the

OR value was over 1. Compared with chemotherapy,
combined BRAF-MEK inhibition improved highest ORR
(OR: 29.46, 95%CI: 20.04-43.57, P < 0.0001), followed
by BRAF inhibition alone (OR: 14.65, 95%CI: 10.4920.90, P < 0.0001), and combined MEK-chemotherapy

DISCUSSION

comparator categories were largely similar to the multiple
comparison analyses. Specially, the results of network
meta-analysis for survival indicated PFS were significantly
prolonged in patients who received combined BRAFMEK inhibition compared with those who received BRAF
inhibition (HR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.51-0.67, P < 0.0001) or
MEK inhibition alone (HR: 0.29, 95%CI: 0.22-0.37, P <
0.0001), respectively. Combined BRAF-MEK inhibition
also improved the OS over BRAF inhibition (HR: 0.67,
95%CI: 0.56-0.81, P < 0.0001) or MEK inhibition alone
(HR: 0.48, 95%CI: 0.36-0.65, P < 0.0001). The similar
benefit has been found in the ORR, which was superior
in combined BRAF and MEK inhibition compared
with BRAF inhibition (OR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.66-2.44,
P < 0.0001) or MEK (OR: 20.66, 95%CI: 12.22-35.47,
P < 0.0001) inhibition alone. These data provide clear
evidence for the benefit of BRAF-MEK inhibition
combination therapy over BRAF or MEK inhibition alone
in prolonging survival and higher response rate. This
promising result of combined BRAF and MEK inhibition
will allow physicians to select this concurrent inhibition
as the preferred therapeutic strategy for patients with MM.
We also believe this meta-analysis is the largest and most
comprehensive study of initial targeted therapy for MM so
far, and provides the highest level of evidence for patients
with MM.
The survival benefit of combined BRAF and MEK
inhibition, not only patients with MM but also those

Despite major advancements in targeted therapy
for MM, however, most patients relapse and show
progressive disease after 7 months with treatment of
BRAF or MEK inhibition alone. The crucial issue is how
to combine targeted inhibition to maximize survival for
patients with MM [22] and to ascertain whether early
use of a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is
the best strategy to forestall resistance [23]. To address
this issue, this meta-analysis provides for the first time
a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of
combined BRAF and MEK inhibition with PFS, ORR,
and OS. Currently, the network meta-analysis supports
the combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is the preferred
strategy in patients with MM.
Different measures of survival can be combined
in a single analysis on the HR scale, avoiding potential
selection bias and loss of information due to only
including studies with the same measure or doing separate
analyses for different measures [24]. Network metaanalysis is a well established research method capable
of comparing different trials using a common reference
trial while maintaining the randomisation design [25].
Our network meta-analysis integrated evidence of HR
and variation from direct and indirect comparisons while
fully preserving randomisation within each trial. From
this presented results, direct comparisons to each of the

with operable BRAF mutation-positive melanoma has
been reported previously [26]. Furthermore, combining
immunotherapy (anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, and antiPD-L1) and targeted therapy (BRAF and MEK inhibitors)
may result in improved antitumor activity with the high
response rates of targeted therapy and the durability of
responses with immunotherapy. Addition of the MEK
inhibitor trametinib would enhance the antitumor activity
of combined immunotherapy with the BRAF inhibitor
dabrafenib [27]. Therefore, our meta-analysis indicated the
combined BRAF and MEK inhibition will be essential for
maximizing clinical benefit of combining immunotherapy
and targeted therapy. Investigation of the anti-tumor
immune response such as CD8 T-cell-rich infiltrate during
combined BRAF and MEK-targeted therapy can also yield
novel therapeutic strategies [26]. Although the treatment
modality is encouraged, the combined BRAF and MEKtargeted therapy is insufficient for long-term durable
responses for MM. Increased MAPK reactivation in early
resistance to dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy
of BRAF-mutant MM has been identified commonly
via BRAF amplification and mutations activating NRAS
and MEK2 [28]. Therefore, to maximize efficacy and
overcome acquired resistance are challenges for rational
conduct of clinical trials.
Prospective trials directly comparing single BRAF
inhibition to single MEK inhibition are lacking. This
meta-analysis is the first to assess the PFS, OS, and OSS
between single BRAF and MEK inhibition, and fills a
crucial knowledge gap of MAPK pathway. Our present
results demonstrated that the single BRAF inhibition had a
statistically significantly longer in PFS (HR: 0.53, 95CI%:
0.42-0.68, P < 0.0001), OS (HR: 0.72, 95%CI: 0.56-0.91,
P < 0.0001), and higher OSS (OR: 10.34, 95%CI: 6.2317.60, P < 0.0001) than those in MEK inhibition alone.
This study provides insight into the concurrent
inhibition of BRAF and MEK for MM; however, it does
have some limitations. First, 5 trials with irrespective of
the BRAF mutation were included in this present metaanalysis. However, BRAF mutation status has been
hypothesized to predict disease recurrence and response
to chemotherapy in melanoma patients [29]. Identification
and stratification of constitutively activating BRAF
mutations in MM has led to observe homogeneous efficacy
for different therapeutic strategies. Second, combined
dabrafenib and trametinib was the first combined BRAF
and MEK inhibition tested in clinical trials [9]. In our
analysis, the combined BRAF and MEK inhibition
was mixed by dabrafenib-trametinib and vemurafenibcobimetinib combination. In the future, the characteristics
of each combination, and comparison between different
combination should be evaluated to identify best
combinative inhibition [30]. Furthermore, studies
evaluating the combination of BRAF/MEK inhibition
with other inhibition such as PI3K/mTOR should be
considered. Finally, an important consideration is that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

this study only analyzes efficacy for combined BRAF
and MEK inhibition, in future study toxic effects should
be evaluated when comparing those targeted therapies,
such as the incidence of pyrexia[31], panniculitis [32],
gastrointestinal or ocular toxicity cutaneous adverse
events [33].

CONCLUSIONS
Knowing all therapeutic options before therapy
initiation will allow physicians to better plan targeted
therapy options including sequence or combine inhibition.
Given the impressive tumor ORR, PFS and OS, it is clear
that combined BRAF and MEK inhibition improves upon
and offers the maximum opportunity for those benefits in
patients with MM. The first priority of therapeutic efficacy
of combined BRAF and MEK inhibition also provides the
robust cornerstone for future triple combination therapy
of BRAF and MEK inhibitors with immunotherapy in
patients with MM.

gov for randomized controlled study without year
and language restrictions, using the following search
algorithm: combined targeted therapy AND melanoma.
After the combinations of dabrafenibâ€“trametinib or
vemurafenibâ€“cobimetinib have been identified, the
keywords of individual inhibition of BRAF (dabrafenib,
vemurafenib, sorafenib) and MEK (trametinib,
cobimetinib, selumetinib), trial and melanoma were
used to search relevant studies according to our previous
MAPK therapy review [34].
First, the titles and abstracts of study reports have
been identified by the search strategies for eligibility, and
then full-text versions of all eligible studies were obtained
for data synthesis. All randomized controlled trials that
compared at least two arms of different treatment regimens
involving targeted therapy were obtained. We required
trials to include data for hazard ratio (HR) for PFS and
OS, and conformed to the convention of reporting HR
showing benefit of experimental drug versus control (HR
< 1 favouring the experimental group and > 1 favouring
the control group). The ORR defined as complete (CR)
or partial response (PR) was according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

trials and extracted information into an electronic
database. From each eligible trial, the first author, year
of publication, sample size, BRAF mutation, Clinical
Trials.gov number, randomized phase and treatments of
experimental and control group were recorded. Primary
and secondary endpoints were also recorded. The primary
end point was PFS. Secondary end points included OS and
ORR, which were measured according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) [35]. The
reported HR was our preferred end point because HR
account for censoring, provide time-to-event information
[36]. When HR were not reported we estimated them from
summary statistics with the method described by Tierney
et al. [37]. We extracted the data for HR and corresponding
95% credibility intervals (CI) for PFS and OS analysis.

Statistical analysis
The traditional pair-wise meta-analysis has been
performed by Stata 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,
USA) for PFS, OS and ORR, respectively. For network
meta-analysis, the model applied to analyze the HR of PFS
and OS was a Bayesian consistency model as described
in Woods et al. [24], with 240000 iterations to obtain the
posterior distributions of model parameters and 40000
burn-ins. The LnHR and SE were generated according
to the HR and corresponding CI value described by
Tierney et al. [37]. HR below one indicated a benefit of
the experimental intervention. We compared ORR with
odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI using NetMetaXL, which
provides an interface for conducting a Bayesian network
meta-analysis using WinBUGS 1.4.3 (MRC Biostatistics
Unit, Cambridge, UK) from within Microsoft Excel [38].
To assess whether there was inconsistency between direct
and indirect comparisons, the pooled HR from the network
meta-analysis have been compared with corresponding HR
from traditional pair-wise random-effects meta-analysis
of direct comparisons as previous described by Liao [36].
Each analysis was based on non-informative uniform with
random-effect model accounting heterogeneity among
studies. We estimated 95% CI from the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles of the posterior distribution. The P value from
the 95% confidence interval has been evaluated according
to the method described by Altman DG [39]. We did
sensitivity analyses by repeating the main computations
using a fixed-effect method. The reporting of this metaanalysis is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines [40].
