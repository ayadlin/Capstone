Abstract
Chemoprevention, especially through the use of naturally
occurring phytochemicals capable of impeding the process of
one or more steps of carcinogenesis process, is a promising
approach for cancer management. Despite promising results
in preclinical settings, its applicability to humans has met
with limited success largely due to inefficient systemic delivery
and bioavailability of promising chemopreventive agents.
Here, we introduce the concept of nanochemoprevention,
which uses nanotechnology for enhancing the outcome of
chemoprevention. We encapsulated green tea polyphenol
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in polylactic acid–polyethylene glycol nanoparticles and observed that encapsulated
EGCG retains its biological effectiveness with over 10-fold
dose advantage for exerting its proapoptotic and angiogenesis
inhibitory effects, critically important determinants of chemopreventive effects of EGCG in both in vitro and in vivo systems.
Thus, this study could serve as a basis for the use of
nanoparticle-mediated delivery to enhance bioavailability
and limit any unwanted toxicity of chemopreventive agents,
such as EGCG. [Cancer Res 2009;69(5):1712–6]

Introduction
Cancer remains one of the most devastating diseases in the
world amid epidemiologic studies suggesting that cancer will be
the number one disease in prevalence by 2020 (1). Chemoprevention via the use of naturally occurring nontoxic agents has
emerged as a plausible strategy for cancer management (2).
Despite promising results in preclinical settings, the applicability of
chemoprevention to human has met with only limited success,
largely due to inefficient systemic delivery and bioavailability of
promising agents. Therefore, to achieve maximum response of a
chemopreventive agent, novel strategies are required to enhance
the bioavailability of potentially useful agents and reduce perceived
toxicity. We envisioned that nanoparticle-mediated delivery could
be useful to limit the toxicity and enhance the bioavailability of the
chemopreventive agents. It is noteworthy that, in recent years,
nanotechnology is being implemented and assessed in different
areas of cancer therapeutics and cancer management (3). However,
the use of nanotechnology has not been pursued to improve the

outcome of chemopreventive strategies. In this study, we have
assessed the effectiveness of delivery of epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG), encapsulated in polylactic acid (PLA)–polyethylene glycol
(PEG) nanoparticles against human prostate cancer (PCa) cells
under in vitro and in vivo situations. Our choice for the selection of
EGCG and PCa in this study is based on several facts. PCa is one of
the most prevalent cancers among men, accounting for an
estimated 186,320 new cases and 28,660 deaths in 2008 in the
United States alone (4). EGCG is a well-studied chemopreventive
agent and has shown remarkable chemopreventive potential in a
wide range of cell culture and preclinical studies (5, 6).
Furthermore, few best evidences of the cancer chemopreventive
effects of EGCG come from PCa (6, 7).
Since most biological processes, including those that are cancerrelated, occur at nanoscale, nanoparticulate technology is a
potential tool to diagnose and treat cancer. The structure and
tunable surface functionality of nanoparticles allow them to
encapsulate/conjugate single or multiple entities either in the core
or on the surface, rendering them ideal carriers for various
anticancer drugs (8). Nanoparticles made up of the biodegradable
and biocompatible polymers like PLA, PLGA, starch, etc., have been
studied for the delivery of various drugs (8, 9). A significant
advantage of these biodegradable polymers is their history of safe
use, proven biocompatibility, and ability to control the time and
rate of polymer degradation and the release of the incorporated
entity. When PLA/PLGA nanoparticles are injected systemically for
drug delivery, they are rapidly cleared by the mononuclear
phagocytic system by the process of endocytosis, thereby
minimizing carrier-induced undesirable cytotoxicity (10). It is well
known that the presence of a hydrophilic polymer-like PEG
increases the circulation time of nanoparticles by stabilizing them
against opsonization (8). PEGylation (i.e., the attachment of PEG to
proteins and drugs) is an upcoming methodology for drug
development, and it has the potential to revolutionize medicine
by drastically improving the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of administered drugs (11).

Materials and Methods
Nanoformulation. PLA-PEG (150–200 AL; 80 mg/mL in DMSO) and
EGCG (100 AL; 100 mg/mL DMSO) were mixed together. This mixture of
PLA-PEG and EGCG was added drop wise to 20 mL of 2% (w/v) polyvinyl
alcohol solution with constant stirring. Resulting solution was sonicated for
10 to 30 s and then stirred using magnetic stirring for 3 h. It was than
dialyzed to remove the nonencapsulated EGCG from the solution. Finally,
the solution was lyophilized to obtain the nanoformulation in powder form,
which was readily soluble in PBS. Characterization of the nanoparticles was
done by particle size analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1), transmission electron
microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S2), and ~ potential measurement

(Supplementary Fig. S3). The amount of the encapsulated EGCG was
determined by forced degradation of the nanoparticles. The concentration
of encapsulated EGCG was determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography.
Cell viability. Cells were treated with EGCG formulations or PLA-PEG
nanoparticles dissolved in PBS. The effect of the treatment on the viability
of cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, as described previously (12).
Protein extraction and Western blotting. Protein extraction and
Western blotting was performed, as described previously (12).
Detection of apoptosis. The Annexin V–FLUOS staining assay for
apoptosis was performed, as described previously (13). Furthermore,
apoptosis was also quantified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP-biotin nick and labeling assay, as described previously (14).
Colony formation assay. Cells (8  103) were seeded in tissue culture
dishes and treated with desired EGCG formulation after 24 h. The cells were
maintained under standard cell culture conditions at 37jC and 5% CO2 in a
humid environment. Colonies that formed in 2 to 3 wk were fixed with 10%

buffered formalin, stained with 2% gentian violet (w/v methanol solution),
washed with water, and air-dried.
Chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was performed, as described previously (15).
In vivo tumor xenograft studies. Tumor xenografts were established, as
described previously (13). The mice were then randomly divided into three
groups of seven animals each. Group I mice (control) did not receive any
treatment; group II mice each received 100 Ag of EGCG encapsulated in
PLA-PEG nanoparticles (hereafter called ‘nano-EGCG’) dissolved in PBS
thrice weekly; group III mice each received 1 mg of nonencapsulated EGCG
dissolved in PBS thrice weekly. Tumor growth was determined in terms of
volume of tumors (mm3) as a function of time. At the termination of the
study (when the tumor volume reached 1,300 mm3 in the control group),
tumors were excised, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC.
Blood samples were collected either by the ‘‘mandibular bleed’’ or by
the ‘‘retro-orbital bleed.’’ The serum was separated, by allowing the blood
to clot and centrifuging it for 20 min at 4jC, and stored at 80jC for
further analysis.

done using the digitalized scientific software program UN-SCAN-IT (Silk
Scientific Corporation). Comparisons between controls and nonencapsulated EGCG–treated or nano-EGCG–treated groups were made using a twotailed Student’s t test, and values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Each experiment was repeated thrice with similar results.

To assess the possibility of treatment-toxicity, the effect of treatments on
fluid and food consumption and body weight was monitored throughout
the study. We did not observe any major difference in weight and fluid
intake during the course of study (data not shown).
ELISA for PSA estimation. Commercially available ELISA was
performed to quantitate PSA levels in the serum of nude mice, as described
previously (13).
LC-MS/MS for analysis of EGCG concentration. Mouse blood was
collected immediately, 1, 2, and 4 h after treatment with EGCG
formulations. Internal standard (ethyl gallate, 5 Ag/mL in 50% methanol)
was added to each sample before extraction. For each sample, an aliquot
of 80 AL serum was extracted with ethyl acetate and acetonitrile, the
supernatant was dried, and the residue was resuspended in 40%
acetonitrile. Isocratic chromatography in MRM mode was performed on
a SunFire C18 column, kept at 40jC.
Densitometry and statistical analysis. All in vitro assays were repeated
in three independent experiments, and only representative data are
presented. Immunoblots were scanned by HP PrecisionScan Pro 3.13
(Hewlett-Packard). Densitometry measurements of the scanned bands were

We first compared the effectiveness of nano-EGCG versus
nonencapsulated EGCG on proliferative ability in human PCa
PC3 cells. Treatment of cells with nanoparticles alone had
negligible effect, thereby confirming the lack of any toxicity of
nanoparticles (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, nano-EGCG, compared with
nonencapsulated EGCG, produced remarkably superior effects with
over 10-fold dose advantage. As shown in Fig. 1, the IC50 value of
nano-EGCG (at 24 h posttreatment) was found to be 3.74 Amol/L
compared with 43.6 Amol/L of nonencapsulated EGCG. These
effects were persistent even at 48 and 72 h posttreatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar effects of nano-EGCG were
observed in other PCa cell lines (data not shown), indicating that
the effects observed are general and not cell type specific. We
observed an efficient uptake of nano-EGCG by PC3 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that nanoencapsulation
removes the penetration barriers at cell surfaces. It is possible
that nano-EGCG enters into the cells via endocytosis. They adsorb
serum proteins nonspecifically onto their surface and enter the cell
via receptors on the cell membrane.
We next determined if the effective concentration of EGCG could
be lowered by nanoformulation. We observed enhanced apoptosis
of PC3 cells treated with nano-EGCG compared with nonencapsulated EGCG. We found that 2.74 Amol/L nano-EGCG cause 72%
apoptosis in PC3 cells, whereas, to achieve similar extent of
apoptosis, 40 Amol/L of nonencapsulated EGCG were required,
thereby providing a remarkable dose advantage (Fig. 1B and C).
Using colony formation assay, nano-EGCG was found to show a
remarkable dose advantage (over nonencapsulated EGCG), providing a comparable effect at 5.48 Amol/L nano-EGCG when
compared with 40 Amol/L nonencapsulated EGCG (Fig. 1D).
Our next goal was to determine if nano-EGCG retains its
mechanistic identity. We studied several molecules that have been
shown to be affected by EGCG. Our data showed that the key
regulators of apoptosis, Bcl-2 family of proteins, were significantly
modulated by nano-EGCG. Like nonencapsulated EGCG, nanoEGCG treatment to PC3 cells resulted in a significant increase in
proapoptotic Bax with a concomitant decrease in antiapoptotic
Bcl-2, thereby shifting the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in favor of apoptosis
(Fig. 2A). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2B, we observed an
increase in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Importantly, these responses were observed at a low concentration of
nano-EGCG (1.37 Amol/L), further supporting a remarkable dose
advantage when EGCG was delivered in nanoparticles. We next
assessed the effects of nano-EGCG on induction of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitors WAF1/p21 and CIP1/p27. Immunoblot
analysis and the densitometric quantitation of protein bands
revealed that nano-EGCG resulted in marked induction of p21 and
p27 in a dose-dependent manner with a significant dose advantage
over EGCG (Fig. 2C).
Studies have shown that EGCG is an efficient inhibitor of
angiogenesis (16), which has been shown to have a direct
correlation with PCa (17). Using CAM assay, we observed a 57%
inhibition of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)–induced angiogenesis
with nano-EGCG containing only 3 Ag EGCG compared with only

35% inhibition with 30 Ag nonencapsulated EGCG (Fig. 3A and B).
Furthermore, we observed a significant inhibition of mean branch
formation and tumor weight of neuroblastoma-induced angiogenesis in CAM by nano-EGCG (Fig. 3C and D). These data clearly
indicate that although EGCG suppressed angiogenesis in CAM, the
concentration required to achieve this inhibition was significantly
reduced by its nanoformulation.
To determine the in vivo relevance of our in vitro findings, we
used a xenograft model. We injected athymic nude mice with
androgen-responsive 22Rr1 cells. The choice of 22Rr1 cells was
based on the fact that these cells form rapid tumors with
reproducible results and secrete PSA. We compared the effect of
nano-EGCG (100 Ag/mouse, i.p.) and nonencapsulated EGCG
(1 mg/mouse, i.p.) on the growth of tumors. Our data showed
that, at 45 days postinoculation, the tumor volume in control
mice was 1,242 mm3 whereas, in both treatment groups, a
significant decrease in the tumor volume was observed
(nonencapsulated EGCG, 854 mm3; nano-EGCG, 707 mm3; P <
0.01). These data confirm that, to achieve similar extent of tumor
growth inhibition, 10-fold lower dose of nano-EGCG was required
(Fig. 4A and B). We also observed a significant inhibition in
serum PSA. The average PSA level in nonencapsulated EGCG–
treated mice was found to be significantly decreased to 9.31
(F2.42) ng/mL compared with 29.86 (F8.33) ng/mL in control
mice (Fig. 4C), whereas the nano-EGCG treatment led to an
additional decrease in the levels of serum PSA of 2.64 (F 0.42)
ng/mL (Fig. 4C). The observed decrease of serum PSA by nano-

EGCG at such a low concentration is an important observation,
because serum PSA is arguably regarded as the best marker in
the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa in human (18).
Limited bioavailability is the major drawback associated with
the failure of many naturally occurring chemopreventive agents
in clinical settings. As shown by the data in Fig. 4D, the rate of
degradation of nonencapsulated EGCG was rapid with a
complete degradation within 4 h, whereas nano-EGCG had a
significantly longer half-life (Fig. 4D). Thus, it seems that
nanoformulation can enhance the stability of EGCG in vivo,
providing a target-specific enhanced bioavailability leading to a
significantly better clinical outcome. Since EGCG has been
shown to act in synergy with other therapeutic approaches
(12, 13), we presume that nanoformulation of EGCG will also
result in similar effects. Because of enhanced stability, nanoEGCG will provide a much better response when used in
combination with other approaches.
In this study, we show the efficacy of nanoparticulate technology
to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of EGCG. Our data clearly
suggest that nano-EGCG exhibits >10-fold dose advantage over
nonencapsulated EGCG. We also show that EGCG retains its
mechanistic signature upon nanoformulation. As with many other
nanoparticles, the advantage of using PLA-PEG nanoparticles lies
in their high surface area to volume ratio, which presumably allows
them to upload more EGCG while maintaining the small size. This
is particularly important because the enhanced conjugation of
nanoparticles with agents often results in the generation of

nanoparticles that are sparingly taken up by the diseased cells,
owing to their bigger size and, thereby, undermining their medical
usefulness (19). Also, the therapeutic/clinical importance of
PLA-PEG nanoparticles relies on the fact that, being biodegradable,
they rarely pose any toxicity (8, 20).
Based on our promising data, we suggest that the concept of
nanochemoprevention (i.e., encapsulation of chemopreventive
agents in nanoparticles) possesses strong merit and rationale for
conducting additional detailed in vivo studies in appropriate
animal models with relevance to human disease.
