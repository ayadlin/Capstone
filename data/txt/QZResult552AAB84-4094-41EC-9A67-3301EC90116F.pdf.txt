ABSTRACT
The CXCR4 receptor (Chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4) is highly expressed
in different hematological malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL). The CXCR4 ligand (CXCL12) stimulates CXCR4 promoting cell survival and
proliferation, and may contribute to the tropism of leukemia cells towards lymphoid
tissues. Therefore, strategies targeting CXCR4 may constitute an effective therapeutic
approach for CLL. To address that question, we studied the effect of Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564), a fully human IgG4 anti-CXCR4 antibody, using a stroma – CLL cells
co-culture model. We found that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) inhibited CXCL12
mediated CXCR4 activation-migration of CLL cells at nanomolar concentrations. This
effect was comparable to AMD3100 (Plerixafor - Mozobil), a small molecule CXCR4
inhibitor. However, Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) but not AMD3100 induced apoptosis
in CLL at nanomolar concentrations in the presence or absence of stromal cell support.
This pro-apoptotic effect was independent of CLL high-risk prognostic markers, was
associated with production of reactive oxygen species and did not require caspase
activation. Overall, these findings are evidence that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) has
biological activity in CLL, highlight the relevance of the CXCR4-CXCL12 pathway as a
therapeutic target in CLL, and provide biological rationale for ongoing clinical trials
in CLL and other hematological malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

C-X-C motif receptor 4). CXCR4 is a G protein coupled
receptor consisting of 7 transmembrane domains, [2]
that is expressed in different cell types, including B
cells, monocytes, T cells, neutrophils, macrophages,
natural killer (NK) cells, endothelial, epithelial, CD34+
hematopoietic stem cells, and dendritic cells [3-6].
CXCR4 not only is expressed in CLL but also in a variety

most frequent adult leukemia and is characterized by
accumulation of aberrant B-lymphocytes [1]. Stromal

of cancers including acute myeloid leukemia, myeloma,
lymphomas, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, breast, lung,
colon, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer [7]. CXCR4 has a
single ligand, CXCL12 (chemokine C-X-C motif ligand
12), [8] which is a homeostatic chemokine also known as
stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1). CXCL12 regulates
hematopoietic cell trafficking, secondary lymphoid tissue
architecture, and homing of hematopoietic stem cells
(HSC) to the bone marrow [5]. In addition, CXCL12
mediates survival, proliferation of B-cell progenitors and
CLL cells, [9, 10] and participates in vitro in stromal cell
dependent resistance to cytotoxic drugs like fludarabine
(F-ara-A), [6] or steroids [11]. Therefore, CXCL12
mediated activation of CXCR4 may favor resistance to
therapy in CLL patients by promoting and maintaining
minimal residual disease [12-14].
Several anti-CXCR4 antibodies are currently
available including MAbs 6H7, 7D4, 1D9, and 12G5,
[15-16] which are used primarily as reagents for flow
cytometry or immunohistochemistry. Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a novel IgG4
fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the second
extracellular loop of CXCR4.
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) binds to CXCR4
at low nanomolar concentrations compared to other
commercially available antibodies (e.g. 1D9). This
antibody prevents the binding of CXCL12 and inhibits
calcium flux mediated cell motility and migration [17].
The Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) antibody is an IgG4
[17], that lacks complement-dependent cytotoxicity
activity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity as confirmed in the current
study in primary CLL and Ramos cell lines. Therefore,
most of its anti-cancer activity is possibly mediated
by direct binding to CXCR4 and interference with the
interaction to its ligand (CXCL12). Here, we present our
studies with primary leukemia cells from CLL patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

using Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) in culture conditions
that resemble the leukemia microenvironment.

RESULTS
Expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 in CLL,
normal B, and stroma-NK-tert cells
Expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 was assessed
by flow cytometry in primary leukemia cells from patients
with CLL as well as in normal B, and stroma-NK-tert cells
(Figure 1A and 1B). Additionally, established cell lines
used in our experiments as controls were evaluated for
CXCR4 expression (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure
1).
We observed that the level of expression of CXCR4
was higher in CLL by at least 8 fold when compared to
normal B cells. As expected, CXCL12 expression was not
detected in CLL cells but was high in stroma-NK-tert cells
(Figure 1B), and other leukemia and lymphoma cell lines
(Figure 2A-2B and Supplementary Figure 2).
We evaluated a group of 20 patients categorized
as CLL-HR and 20 patients categorized as CLL-LR
(defined by using prognostic markers discussed above).
We observed that the level of CXCR4 expression was
independent of prognostic factors with an average ∆MFI
(mean fluorescence intensity) of 432.2 (95% CI 314.5549.9) (Figure 1C). There was no significant difference
between CLL-HR and CLL-LR subtypes of CLL, but there
was a significant difference between CLL subtypes versus
normal B cells (p < 0.0001) with a level of expression
that was 8 fold lower compared with CLL samples (∆MFI
average of 26.07 - 95% CI 11.6-40.5, p <0.01).

mediated by effector cell mechanisms (ADCC, Figure 2G)
or by complement (CDC, Figure 2H).
We analyzed whether direct binding of CXCR4
could trigger apoptosis. K562 (CXCR4-, Figure 2A),
and Ramos (CXCR4+, Figure 2B) were incubated with
increasing concentrations of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564)
and then analyzed for development of apoptosis using flow
cytometry. Only Ramos cells, which express high levels of
CXCR4, underwent apoptosis (IC50 1.9 nM) while K562
cells did not show evidence of cell death even when the
antibody was used at high mM concentrations (Figure
3A). Before screening the primary CLL cells, we carried
out washout experiments using the equivalent in vivo
achievable concentration of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564)
(67 nM or 10 ug/ml). We found that the cells started to
show in vitro cytotoxic effect within 5-10 hrs of treatment.
It seems that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) saturates the
cells in terms of cell death as the changes in CLL or CLL
co-cultured with stroma-NK-tert cells become steady
(Supplementary Figure 3). Similar dose dependent proapoptotic activity was observed in primary leukemia cells
from CLL patients (IC50 of 12.43 nM). Interestingly, the
activity of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) was present
whether or not the leukemia cells were cultured alone
or with stromal cell support. This indicates that the
activity of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) is likely due to
direct binding to CXCR4 rather than interference of the
CXCR4-CXCL12 receptor / ligand interaction. Moreover,
this antibody was able to overcome fludarabine resistance
conferred by stromal cells in this in vitro model (Figure
3B). AMD3100, which binds and inhibits signaling
through CXCR4, was used as a control. Importantly, this
molecule did not induce cell death in CLL or any of the
cell lines tested (Figure 3B, and data not shown).

We determined affinity and saturation binding
of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) to CXCR4 using a
radiolabeled antibody 125I-BMS-936564 in Ramos cell line
(Burkitt’s lymphoma). In comparison to K562 (chronic
myelogenous leukemia, Figure 2A), there was high level
of CXCR4 expression in Ramos cell line (Figure 2B).
Competitive affinity binding of Ulocuplumab (BMS936564) showed a mean KD (the equilibrium dissociation)
of 2.8 nM and approximately 150,000 CXCR4 receptors
per cell in B-lymphoma cells (Ramos, Figure 2C). Specific
binding affinity of this antibody to human PBMCs was
lower - 5.9 nM (Figure 2D), and the number of receptors
per cell that was approximately one third of that found in
human PBMCs (61,000 per cell).

Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) (IgG4 antibody)
lacks ADCC or CDC activity but induces
apoptosis mediated by CXCR4 binding
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) was engineered as
a fully human IgG4 antibody with the purpose to lack
ADCC or CDC activity and to work as a “blocking
antibody”. We tested this antibody in vitro to demonstrate
the lack of those two important functions.
Ramos and PBMC effector cells were incubated
with increasing concentrations of Ulocuplumab (BMS936564) to evaluate antibody dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Figure 2E), or with complement
(CDC) (Figure 2F). Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) did
not induce cytotoxicity in the CLL-B cells (target cells)

for surface staining in K562 and B. Ramos cell lines followed by analysis of samples using flow cytometry. The CXCR4 expression is
presented in form of ∆MFI. C. The affinity of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) was measured using endogenously expressed CXCR4 positive
Ramos cells. The binding capacity of 125I-Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) to CXCR4+ cells in presence or absence of excess unlabeled
antibody was determined and a Kd of 2.9 nM and approximately 1.5x105 receptors/cell was calculated. D. Normal peripheral blood cells
were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564). The counts per minute bound (CPM) in the presence
or absence of unlabeled antibody was measured. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding curves was performed with Prism 4 GraphPad
software (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA) using nonlinear regression analysis. The symbol

(TB), non-saturable binding (NSB), and saturable binding (SB), respectively. E. Ramos cells (target) were labeled with bis(acetoxymethyl)
2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine-6,6″-dicarboxylate (BADTA). Freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs (effector) were
used for allotyping of the Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564). Human PBMCs were cultured with labeled Ramos cells at 1:50 ratio of target/
effector cell (T/E) ratios in the presence or absence of rituximab, Ulocuplumab, or isotype (BMS-936564) for 1 h at 37°C. Ramos cells
alone served as spontaneous release (SR) and Ramos cells lysed with 1% Triton X-100 served as total release (TR). The lysis was measured
by using europium (Eu)-based detection. BMS-936564, Rituximab and their respective isotypes with varied concentrations were tested
using Ramos cell line. F. Cell-based CDC assay of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) /Rituximab and their respective isotypes as controls: lysis
of Ramos cells in the presence of human complement was measured by using Alamar Blue release. G. The stable transfected Jurkat cell line
expressing FcgRIIIa and NFAT-RE luc was used as effector E. in an ADCC Reporter Bioassay from Promega. CLL cells (target, T) were
plated in ratio of 1:1 with the effector cells. The effector: target cells were incubated in the presence or absence of rituximab or Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564), or obinutuzumab between 0.001-30 ug/ml of concentrations for 6 hrs at 37°C. Rituximab and obinutuzumab were used as
positive controls. The reaction was developed by incubating the cells with Bio-GloTM reagent for 30 minutes at room temperature in dark.
The plates were read on luminometer and following the background subtraction, relative-light units (RLU) were calculated for different
antibodies/isotypes using GraphPad Prism software. H. Complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) for 10 μg/ml of either Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564), rituximab, obinutuzumab or isotype was tested in CLL cells after incubation with either 5% fresh human or heat inactivated
serum (to denature complement) was measured by using CD19/CD5/Annexin V staining followed by flow cytomerty analysis. Rituximab
and obinutuzumab were used as positive controls. The data are the mean and SD of triplicate cultures. The statistical data was analyzed
using Bonferroni correction test in GraphPad Prism software.

The pro-apoptotic activity of Ulocuplumab (BMS936564) was stronger on different cell lines and CLL
cells compared to other commercially available CXCR4
antibodies – 1D9,[18, 19] and 12G5 [20, 21]. In the case
of 1D9 the IC50 was not achievable and for 12G5 was 32.1
nM in CLL cells (Supplementary Figure 4). Additionally,
in screening of different leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, we
found that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564), as compared to
12G5 and 1D9 antibodies was, more effectively inducing
in vitro cytotoxicity (Table 2).

and the apoptosis levels were significantly higher than
those observed after treatment with F-ara-A.
The IC50 for different CLL subgroups including lowrisk, high-risk and TP53mut /Del(17p) were 4.9 nM, 9.8
nM, and 11.6 nM, respectively. In contrast, the IC50 was
not achieved in normal B and T lymphocytes. On the other
hand, normal B and T lymphocytes appear to be resistant
to the cytotoxic activity of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564)
with apoptosis levels that were significantly lower than
those observed in CLL samples. (Figure 4A).

Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) preferentially
induces apoptosis in CLL/cancer cell lines, but not
in normal lymphocytes

Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induced apoptosis is
independent of p53 status
To show that the activity of Ulocuplumab (BMS936564) was p53 independent, we incubated leukemia
cells derived from either TP53wt or TP53mut /Del(17p)
CLL patients and Ramos (TP53mut), and compared
the level of apoptosis induced by F-ara-A, which is
known to be a p53 dependent chemotherapy agent. [22]
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induced cell death in CLL
TP53wt, TP53mut /Del(17p) and Ramos (TP53mut) with
similar IC50 (2.7 nM, 2.7 nM, and 3 nM respectively).
As expected, F-ara-A was active only in CLL TP53wt
and the IC50 for F-ara-A in TP53mut /Del(17p) and
Ramos (TP53mut) was not achieved even after using this
compound at supra-physiological concentration (Figure
4B).

Leukemia cells from CLL patients with CLL-HR
or CLL-LR disease were incubated with Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564) and apoptosis was evaluated after 48 hrs
of culture. Despite of the presence of high-risk prognostic
factors [unmutated IgVH genes, high levels of ZAP-70
or TP53mut /Del(17p)], which are typically associated
with poor clinical outcome and disease progression, we
observed similar levels of apoptosis in CLL-HR and
CLL-LR samples (Figure 4A). Interestingly, samples
from patients with TP53mut /Del(17p) were sensitive to
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564), and showed comparable
levels of apoptosis with CLL-HR and CLL-LR samples

Figure 3: % SIA induction by Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) is CXCR4 specific as observed in Ramos and primary

and AMD3100 for 48 hrs followed by running the samples on flow cytometer to study the % SIA. Treatment with AMD3100 in Ramos/
K562/CLL did not induce significant % SIA as compared to Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564). In contrast, Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564)
induced significant % SIA in Ramos and CLL cells (CXCR4+), but not in K562 (CXCR4-) as evaluated by flow cytometry). B. The CLL
cells cultured either alone or with stromal cell support were treated with Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) or AMD3100 for 48 hrs at 37oC
followed by flow cytometer for measurement of % SIA. AMD3100 does not induce significant % SIA in CLL as compared to Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564). Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induced significant amount of % SIA in CLL cells alone or CLL co-cultured with stromal
cell support.

Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) inhibits F-actin
polymerization and cell migration

Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induction of
programmed cell death (PCD) is caspase
independent

The functional activity of Ulocuplumab (BMS936564) was studied in CLL samples that underwent
CXCR4 activation mediated by CXCL12. Using this
model, CLL cells treated with CXCL12 underwent
cytoskeletal reorganization measured by F-actin
polymerization assay and chemotactic changes that were
measured using a transwell migration assay.
CXCL12 induced an average increase in actin
polymerization of 152.54% after stimulation with 90 nM
CXCL12 for 15 seconds at 37°C. Ulocuplumab (BMS936564) at 200 nM (p < 0.0001) and 2 μM (p < 0.0001)
concentrations significantly inhibited actin polymerization
and reduced the peak response to CXCL12 by an average
of 20-40%. Similarly, significant levels (p <0.0001) of
inhibition were observed with AMD3100 at 4 μM and
40 μM concentrations), which was used as control for
CXCR4 inhibition (Figure 5A).
CXCL12 induced chemotaxis and transwell
migration in CLL cells with an average increase > 90%
over base line (Figure 5B). Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564)
(20 nM-2 μM) significantly inhibited cell migration by
40- 58%. AMD3100 (40 μM) also inhibited significantly
(p <0.05) the migration compared to the peak stimulation
after CXCL12 (Figure 5B).

To study the mechanism(s) of Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564) induced apoptosis, we evaluated caspase
activation in CLL cells as well as in normal B cells after
incubation with this antibody. Ulocuplumab (BMS936564) induced significant caspase activation (caspase 2,
3, 8, 9) in CLL cells but not in normal B cells (Figure 6A).
However, inhibition of caspase activation with Z-VAD did
not block Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induced apoptosis
suggesting that caspase activation is not required for the
pro-apoptotic activity of this antibody (Figure 6B).

Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induces cell death
via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
in CLL cells
Because the mechanism of action related to the proapoptotic activity of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) appears
to be caspase independent, we performed experiments to
address other possible explanations including induction of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), which has been associated
with monoclonal antibody induction of cell death [23].
CLL cells were incubated with Ulocuplumab (BMS-

primary leukemia B-cells were obtained from CLL patients with or without TP53 mutation or Del(17p) [TP53mut /Del(17p)]. Normal B
and T lymphocytes were obtained from healthy donors. The % SIA was measured in normal B, T cells, CLL cells, TP53mut /Del(17p) CLL
cells, alone or co-cultured with stroma-NK-tert cells after treatment with 200 nM of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) for 48 hrs of incubation
at 37°C. % SIA of Normal B and T cells was significantly less when compared to CLL-LR, CLL-HR and TP53mut /Del(17p) patients,
showing that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) has a good therapeutic index. Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induced apoptosis in CLL cells
regardless of TP53mut /Del(17p) mutation status, while normal B or T cells showed statistically-lower level of apoptosis. The data shows
the results of samples analyzed in duplicate with the mean and its respective standard deviations. B. Representative CLL samples from each
subgroup - TP53wt or TP53mut /Del(17p) and Ramos TP53 mutant were incubated for 48 hrs with the Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) and
Fludarabine (F-ara-A). Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry.

936564) or with controls (H2O2, Obinituzumab, F-ara-A,
and Rituximab), and then were evaluated for superoxide
production by using hydroxyethidium (HE) in conjunction
with Annexin V to measure apoptosis. We observed that
after 4 hrs of incubation, cells treated with Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564) showed a rapid increase in cell death
and ROS production with levels that were significantly
higher compared to untreated controls (p < 0.05).
Positive controls for this experiment including H2O2 and
Obinituzumab, an anti CD20 antibody known to induce
ROS+ mediated apoptosis, showed an expected increase
in ROS levels compared with untreated samples while
isotype antibody control, rituximab and F-ara-A did not
show an increase in ROS+/Annexin-V+ cells (Figure 7A).
More over, ROS induction was a critical step required for
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) to induce apoptosis. This
was demonstrated when Tiron, a ROS inhibitor that has
been extensively used in the previous studies [23-25],
completely abrogated the ROS production and apoptosis
induced by Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) in leukemia cells
(Figure 7B and 7C).

important for the migration of immune cells to the site
of inflammation and play an important role maintaining
the homeostasis in the tumor microenvironment [26, 27].
Particularly, CXCR4 expression in CLL regulates cell
migration, homing to lymphoid tissues and could favor the
formation of minimal residual disease after treatment by
inducing a “protective” anti-apoptotic microenvironment
[28]. Therefore, the cellular signaling mediated by CXCR4
constitutes a potential biological target in CLL and other
malignancies.
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) is a first in class,
fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that has been
engineered to specifically bind to CXCR4 [17]. In vitro
studies have shown that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564)
has a potent anti-tumor activity in established tumors
including AML, NHL, and multiple myeloma xenograft
models [17]. In addition, preliminary reports from
clinical studies in hematological malignancies using this
antibody have shown encouraging clinical activity [29].
However, because the precise mechanism(s) of action of
this antibody is not completely understood, we focused
our studies to provide additional insights regarding this
particular question.
We found that primary leukemia cells from CLL
patients have significantly higher levels of CXCR4

pre-labeled CLL cells after stimulation with CXCL12 (90 nM) for 15 seconds. CLL cells from 10 patients (5 HR & 5 LR) were treated with
no compounds (control), AMD3100 (4-40 μM) or Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) (20-2000 nM) prior to stimulation and the representative
example of F-actin polymerization is shown. All samples are plotted relative to the mean fluorescence of the sample without any addition
of the chemokine CXCL12. B. A total of 5x105 cells per well were plated overnight before the experiment. The cells were incubated with
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) and AMD3100 (using indicated concentrations) for one hour and loaded on to the transwell chamber and
incubated for two hrs in the presence of CXCL12 (12.5 nM) or media control. After that, cells that migrated to the lower chamber were
counted using flow cytometry.

expression compared with normal B cells and that highrisk prognostic factors do not influence the level of
expression of this chemokine receptor. None of the patients
were treated in the phase-I clinical trial for Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564). This is in agreement with previous reports
from our group and others [30-32]. More over, CLL cells
did not show expression of CXCL12 (CXCR4 ligand) by
flow cytometry and CXCL12 gene expression by RT-PCR
was also negative in the large majority of samples. This
suggests that activation of CXCR4 induced by CXCL12
occurs either by cell-cell interactions with non-leukemia
CXCL12 expressing cells, likely located in lymphatic
tissues, or mediated by soluble CXCL12.

Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) showed a nanomolar
binding affinity to CXCR4 expressed in Ramos cells
with a CXCR4 receptor concentration that was 3-4 times
higher than peripheral blood mononuclear cells (150,000
vs. 61,000-receptor density / cell). The pro-apoptotic
activity of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) was dependent
on membrane expression of CXCR4, and as expected for
an IgG4 antibody, this molecule did not induce ADCC or
CDC effector functions in Ramos or CLL cells.
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induced CLL death
regardless of the presence of prognostic factors that
we used to segregate CLL-HR and CLL-LR [ZAP70 expression, IgVH gene mutation status, TP53mut /

Figure 6: Effect of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564)-mediated apoptosis in CLL cells is caspase-independent. A. Cells were

treated for 6 hrs with either 200 nM of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) or isotype control (IC). 100 µg of protein was taken from each
treatment for caspase analysis. Caspase 2, 3, 8 and 9 were activated upon treatment with the Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) antibody. There
was a significant difference between normal versus CLL cells for caspase 2, 3, 8, and 9. Caspase activity of cells incubated in media only
was used as a baseline control. Each value is expressed as mean ± S.D. of two independent experiments. B. CLL cells were incubated with
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) (200 nM), F-ara-A (10 μM), and Etoposide (30 μM) for 48 hrs either alone or in combination with different
concentrations of a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK (10, 30, 90 μM). CLL cells viability was analyzed by CD19+/CD5+/Annexin-V
staining followed by flow cytometry. Statistical significance was determined by using Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (* p < 0.05; **
p<0.01, *** p < 0.001). Z-VAD inhibited apoptosis in a dose dependent manner when apoptosis was induced by chemotherapy controls but
not by Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) (untreated media control vs. 0-90 μM Z-VAD , p < 0.0001).

Del(17p)] patients. However, in this cohorts of patients
analyzed, we noticed that patients with TP53mut /Del(17p)
have a lower response compared to other CLL samples.
Despite of that, cell death induced by Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564) in this group of high-risk patients was
significantly better than the low response observed with
F-ara-A (p < 0.0001). These results suggest that the
mechanism of cell death associated with Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564) is, at least in part, p53 independent,
a finding that have significant clinical implications

particularly in the treatment of refractory cancer where
the majority of cases are associated with p53 dysfunction
[33]. Among other anti-CXCR4 antibodies tested, 12G5
and 1D9, only 12G5 was able to induce cell death in CLL
alone or co-cultured with stroma-NK-tert cells support,
but the effect was weaker as compared to Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564). The reason for poor cytotoxicity of 1D9
may be because unlike 12G5, it does not compete for
CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 [19, 34, 35].
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) binds to CXCR4

Figure 7: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated mechanism of cell death by BMS-936564 in patients’ derived CLL
cells. A. Primary CLL cells derived from patients were treated for 4 hrs either with 0.1% H2O2, 10 ug/ml of obinutuzumab, Rituximab,
Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) antibody or F-ara-A at the indicated concentrations. ROS production and cell death were assessed by flow
cytometry. ROS+/Annexin-V+ double positive cells indicate the population of cell undergoing cell death with concurrent release of ROS
(Upper right quadrant). Cells incubated in media only serve as base line control. This experiment represents typical data from three separate
experiments conducted with duplicates per each incubation condition. B. The cells were incubated alone with Tiron (30 mM) or 10 μg/ml
of either rituximab, obinutuzumab, Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564), 0.1% of H2O2 and 10 μM Fludarabine (F-ara-A) with 30 mM of Tiron
for 4 hrs at 37oC . To measure ROS production, following CD19/CD5 labeling, cells were labeled with hydroxyethidium dye and incubated
for 20 minutes at room temperature followed by flow cytometry analysis. The data presented represent mean ROS production± S.D. C. The

and blocks CXCL12 induced cytoskeletal changes and
migration similarly to AMD3100. However, the lack
of direct anti-cancer activity shown by AMD3100 and
other synthetic peptide CXCR4 inhibitors, [6, 31, 36]
suggest that binding to CXCR4 and inhibition of CXCR4CXCL12 signaling is not sufficient to trigger cell death.
This is further supported by evidence that Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564) induced similar levels of cell death in CLL
cells cultured alone (lacking CXCL12 stimulation) or cocultured with CXCL12 expressing stromal cell support.
We observed that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564)
induces pancaspase activation (caspases 2, 3, 8, 9) but this
is not sufficient to induce cell death. This is supported by
the fact that the potent caspase inhibitor Z-VAD did not
block cell death induced by this antibody as it did with
chemotherapy treated controls (etoposide and F-ara-A).
Caspase-independent cell death has been recognized
as an alternative pathway that involves proteins released as
a result of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP) [37, 38]. These proteins including AIF,
HtrA2/Omi, and endonuclease G, can undergo nuclear
translocation to induce an early chromatic condensation,
ROS production, DNA damage, lysosome activation and
proteolysis mediated by release of cathepsin and proteases.
Because our data suggested the presence of
this caspase-independent mechanism, we performed
experiments to analyze the role of ROS in Ulocuplumab
(BMS-936564) mediated cell death. We found that upon
incubation with Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564), CLL cells
generated ROS that were detected using dihydroethidium
(HE) staining. HE is a cell-permeable fluorogenic probe
that reacts with ROS to form ethidium, which intercalates
within double-stranded DNA in the nucleus and emits red
fluorescence. Cells that release ROS also underwent cell
membrane changes associated with apoptosis including
phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation from the inner to the
outer leaflet of the cellular membrane that was detected by
fluorescent staining with annexin V. The pattern of ROS
production and apoptosis induced by Ulocuplumab (BMS936564) was similar to obitunutuzumab (Gazyva), another
antibody that has been recently shown to induce ROS
dependent cell death. More over, Tiron, a well-known
peroxide inhibitor/scavenger, was capable of rescuing
cells from Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induced cell
death confirming that ROS production is essential for this
antibody induction of apoptosis.
Overall, we show here that Ulocuplumab (BMS936564), a specific anti-CXCR4 antibody, binds to
CXCR4 with low affinity and blocks CXCL12 mediated
activation-chemotaxis. This antibody induces apoptosis
in CLL cells regardless of the presence of high-risk
prognostic factors in a p53 independent manner. In
addition, Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) induces cell death
by a caspase-independent mechanism that involves ROS
release. These data highlight the relevance of the CXCR4CXCL12 pathway as a target in cancer therapy and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

provide additional rationale for ongoing clinical studies
using Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) in hematological
malignancies including CLL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and isolation of PBMCs from CLL
patients
Peripheral3 blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
CLL patients were obtained from the CLL Research
Consortium (CRC) tissue repository, Moores Cancer
center, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), La
Jolla. After CLL diagnosis was confirmed, [39] patients
provided written informed consent for blood sample
collection on a protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Moores UCSD Cancer Center, in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [40].
The details of the cell culture for primary CLL
and different cell lines (Table 1), flow cytometry based
CXCR4, CXCL12 profiling, cell death, apoptosis
measurement, CXCR4 binding, F-actin polymerization,
migration, and ROS detention and inhibition, Z-VAD
assay for caspase activation, [41] and dependency assays
are provided in the, “Supplementary Materials and
Methods”[42-44]. Leukemia samples from patients with
CLL were divided in two subgroups i.e. high risk (CLLHR) and low risk (CLL-LR), based on the presence of
high-risk prognostic makers including ZAP-70, CD38, and
IGHV mutational status.
Calculation of specific induced apoptosis (SIA)
In order to discriminate the compound specific
induced apoptosis vs. background spontaneous cell
death from in vitro culture conditions, we calculated the
percentage of specific induced apoptosis (% SIA) using
the following formula: % SIA = [(compound induced
apoptosis – media only spontaneous apoptosis) / (100media only spontaneous apoptosis)] × 100.

Statistical analysis
The data sets were analyzed using GraphPad
Prism software (v. 5.0c; San Diego, CA). The Statistical
significance was determined by using paired or
unpaired Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA followed
by Bonferroni correction’s multiple comparisons test.
Statistical differences for the mean values are indicated
as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; and
****, p < 0.0001. The IC50 value was defined as the drug
concentration that inhibits 50% cell growth compared with
untreated controls and calculated by Graphpad Prism 6.0
software. Unless indicated, data are presented as the mean
± SEM.
