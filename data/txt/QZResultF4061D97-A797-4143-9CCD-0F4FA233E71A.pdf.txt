Abstract
Although microRNAs (miRNA) have been broadly studied in cancer, comparatively less is understood about
their role in progression. Here we report that miR-153 has a dual role during progression of colorectal cancer by
enhancing cellular invasiveness and platinum-based chemotherapy resistance. miRNA proﬁling revealed that
miR-153 was highly expressed in a cellular model of advanced stage colorectal cancer. Its upregulation was also
noted in primary human colorectal cancer compared with normal colonic epithelium and in more advanced
colorectal cancer stages compared with early stage disease. In colorectal cancer patients followed for 50 months,
21 of 30 patients with high levels of miR-153 had disease progression compared with others in this group with low
levels of miR-153. Functional studies revealed that miR-153 upregulation increased colorectal cancer invasiveness
and resistance to oxaliplatin and cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations indicated that miR153 promoted invasiveness indirectly by inducing matrix metalloprotease enzyme 9 production, whereas drug
resistance was mediated directly by inhibiting the Forkhead transcription factor Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a). In
support of the latter ﬁnding, we found that levels of miR-153 and FOXO3a were inversely correlated in matched
human colorectal cancer specimens. Our ﬁndings establish key roles for miR-153 overexpression in colorectal
cancer progression, rationalizing therapeutic strategies to target expression of this miRNA for colorectal cancer
treatment. Cancer Res; 73(21); 6435–47. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the second commonest cause of cancerrelated death in western societies (1). Disease progression and
metastases are the principal causes of death, and advanced
disease occurs in up to 30% at presentation (2). In addition, in
patients with localized disease who proceed to apparently
curative surgery, 50% subsequently develop recurrence (2,
3). Despite increasingly sophisticated techniques for therapy

to recurrent colorectal cancer, the majority of patients remain
incurable, highlighting the need for a continued effort to better
understand the complexities of disease progression, and identify new directions for treatment strategies.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short noncoding RNA molecules
and play a critical role in malignant transformation, underscored by the observation that over 50% of miRNA genes are
located within or close to cancer-associated genomic regions
(4, 5). miRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to the 30 untranslated region (30 -UTR) of protein-coding mRNAs through sequences in the 50 -end of the miRNA that are only
partially complementary (6). One consequence of this imperfect complementarity is that each miRNA can regulate multiple
target mRNAs and thereby impact functionally diverse programs of gene expression. miRNA expression is deregulated in
colorectal cancer with a growing number of oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes under miRNA regulation (7, 8). Importantly, miRNA expression patterns correlate with distinct
colorectal cancer subtypes and clinical phenotype (8–11).
Emerging data have also implicated miRNAs in disease progression and acquisition of metastatic capabilities in noncolorectal malignancies, through promotion of epithelial–mesenchymal transition and regulation of metastasis-associated
genes (12, 13). To date however, little is understood about the
role of miRNAs in disease progression in colorectal cancer and
few candidate miRNAs and target genes have been implicated.

In this study, we hypothesized that deregulated miRNAs
contribute to colorectal cancer progression. miR-153 was
identiﬁed as overexpressed in more advanced colorectal cancer using cell models and human tumor samples. Functional
and mechanistic studies show that overexpression of miR-153
can increase colorectal cancer invasiveness through upregulation of matrix metalloprotease enzyme 9 (MMP-9), and additionally lead to enhanced platinum-based chemotherapy resistance. This latter effect may be through an inhibitory effect on
the Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) transcription factor, which we
show is targeted by miR-153, and inversely correlates with miR153 in human colorectal cancer samples. Together, these
results point to a signiﬁcant and novel contribution of upregulated miR-153 in colorectal cancer, and suggest that modulation of miR-153 may be a useful strategy in limiting colorectal cancer progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell and organotypic cultures, transfections, and cloning
Details of the cell lines, cloning, and transfections are
provided in supplementary methods (14–16, 44). Organotypic
cultures were prepared as previously described (17). Gels
comprised a 50:50 mixture of Matrigel and type I collagen
with 5  105 human fetal ﬁbroblast cells, to which were added
5  105 SW480 cells stably transfected with 2 mg plasmid
expression constructs for miR-153 or control scrambled
miRNA (CmiR00001-MR04; GeneCopoeia). Media were changed every 2 days, and gels harvested and formalin ﬁxed after
14 days.
Patients and samples
Samples from patients with biopsy-proven colorectal cancer
were obtained fresh at the time of surgery and snap frozen
before being deposited in a UK Human Tissue Act approved
tumor bank. In each case, matched tumor and uninvolved proximal mucosa were obtained. All patients provided informed
consent, and the study was approved by the regional research
ethics committee. Pathologic veriﬁcation of diagnosis and
staging was in accordance with the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland guidelines (18). All specimens were reviewed by clinicians with a specialist interest in
gastrointestinal pathology using parafﬁn-embedded tissue
that was adjacent to or in close proximity to tumor bank
tissue. Tumors used in this study were adenocarcinomas only,
and selected at random from the tumor bank before laser
capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA extraction. Exclusion
criteria included evidence of a hereditary tumor, presence of
multiple tumors, and tumors with histologically identiﬁed
extensive necrosis. A total of 100 human tumors were examined. RNA extraction from tumors is described in supplementary methods.

Results
MicroRNA expression proﬁling in SW480 and SW620
cells
Expression of 328 human miRNAs was determined in the
paired colorectal cancer lines SW480 and SW620. Figure 1A
and B show that the top 20 miRNAs up- or downregulated
>4-fold in the metastatic SW620 cells compared with SW480.
Some candidates identiﬁed have been previously found to be
deregulated in colorectal cancer by other groups (9–11). To
further verify microarray data, 9 miRNAs of variable fold
change were selected for real-time PCR validation. Consistent
with the microarray data, similar fold changes in the selected
miRNAs were found with high correlation between microarray
and PCR results (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Expression of miR-153 is increased in colorectal cancer
and advanced disease
To prioritize differentially expressed miRNA candidates for
further study, putative mRNA targets of the top 15 miRNAs
were predicted computationally using TargetScan (www.targetscan.org). This gene list was annotated and then subjected
to gene-set enrichment analysis using the DAVID bioinformatics resource (see supplementary methods) to identify overrepresented biological processes for each candidate miRNA. This
data were collated and compared for all 15 overexpressed
miRNA candidates, to inspect for enrichment of biological
processes associated with disease progression and cancer
spread (summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1C). One miRNA
identiﬁed in our cell line proﬁling as upregulated over 12-fold
in higher stage colorectal cancer was miR-153. Clustered and
nonclustered analyses for miR-153 show that based on a P
value of 0.001, 55% of the 36 biological processes identiﬁed
were cancer associated. In addition, the highest enrichment
score obtained for all candidate miRNAs was associated with
miR-153 and the biological processes of motility and adhesion
with an enrichment score of 12.5, suggesting that deregulation

of miR-153 may have important consequences in carcinogenesis and disease progression.
Further assessment with Panther, BioCarta, and KEGG
annotation categories for miR-153 in DAVID showed enrichment of genes associated speciﬁcally with colorectal cancer
(P < 0.005), and the Wnt, Cadherin, and TGF-b (P < 0.001)
signaling pathways, lending additional support for a link
between miR-153 deregulation and colorectal tumorigenesis
in particular (Supplementary File S1).
Prompted by this, we investigated expression of miR-153 in
a panel of human colorectal cancer cell lines. Five of 10 cell
lines examined showed signiﬁcant upregulation of miR-153
levels compared with SW480 cells (Fig. 1C). The pattern of
miR-153 expression closely correlated with the expression of
matching cell lines in the NCI-60 panel as determined through
the web application CellMiner (43). To determine miR-153
expression in vivo, we conducted a small scale pilot to examine
10 random tumors of varying stage by LCM and miRNA
expression analysis. Signiﬁcantly increased expression of
miR-153 was noted in tumor compared with normal tissue
(Supplementary Fig. S2A; P < 0.0001). As transition between
SW480 and SW620 cells principally reﬂects a change toward a
metastatic phenotype, we examined expression of miR-153 in
metastatic compared with nonmetastatic tumors. Expression
of miR-153 in 5 nonmetastatic stage 1 tumors was compared
with 5 stage 3 and 5 stage 4 tumors with lymphatic or distant
organ metastases (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Higher expression of miR-153 was noted in more advanced colorectal cancer
(P < 0.005).
We extended our analysis to an additional unselected group
of 83 human samples with known clinical outcome (clinicopathologic data presented in Supplementary Table S1) comprising 23 normal mucosa; 20 stage 1 (T1-2/N0/M0 tumors); 20
stage 3 or 4 (any T/N1-2 or M1); and 20 metastases (liver and
lung). Signiﬁcantly increased miR-153 expression was noted in
tumor compared with normal tissue (Fig. 1D; P < 0.005) and
with increasing disease stage. Speciﬁcally, higher levels were
noted in tumors with nodal or distant organ spread (Fig. 1E; P <
0.005). When median expression of miR-153 was used to
stratify patients, after a follow up time of 50 months, 21 of
30 patients in the high miR-153 group developed disease
progression compared with 9 of 30 in the low miR-153 group
(Fig. 1F). Factors associated with improved disease-free survival by univariate analysis included the absence of extramural
vascular invasion (EMVI) and low miR-153 expression (log
rank P ¼ 0.007; x2 ¼ 7.3; Supplementary Table S2). Demographic characteristics, histological grading, and the type of
surgery did not have a signiﬁcant impact on survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that both EMVI and miR-153 status
were independent prognostic factors [for EMVI, P < 0.001;
HR ¼ 9.6; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 3.63–49.12; for miR-153
status, P ¼ 0.024; HR ¼ 4.7; 95% CI, 1.17–8.74].
miR-153 overexpression is not due to genetic copy
number change
Deregulation of miRNAs has been attributed to genomic
copy number changes (5) and miRNAs are overrepresented in
regions of genomic gain in colorectal cancer (20). We therefore

6438

Cancer Res; 73(21) November 1, 2013

sought to determine if miR-153 upregulation in colorectal
cancer was due to copy number change. SW620 cells were
analyzed using a Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 with the
hapmap270.422 dataset as reference. miR-153 is located on
chromosome 2q35, however no copy number changes at this
locus were identiﬁed (Supplementary Fig. S3). To clarify if the
miR-153 locus is subject to copy number change in primary
colorectal cancer, we examined the Mitelman Database of
Chromosome Aberrations (21). A total of 346 cases of colorectal cancer were identiﬁed and examined for recurrent and
nonrecurrent cytogenetic band 2q35 abnormalities. No abnormalities affecting this locus were identiﬁed.
Functional consequences of miR-153 overexpression
To determine any potential functional roles of overexpressed miR-153 in promoting colorectal cancer progression,
we investigated the effects of transiently overexpressed miR153 on a series of cancer-relevant in vitro cell-based assays
testing growth and proliferation, invasion and motility, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity in SW480 cells. miR-153 overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S4A) had no effect on proliferation (Fig. 2A), anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 2B),
or cell migration using scratch and transwell invasion assays
without matrigel (data not shown). Overexpression of miR153 promoted a more invasive phenotype in SW480 cells
however, when matrigel-coated transwell invasion assays
were examined (Fig. 2C and D; P < 0.05). Apoptosis was
assessed in the presence or absence of cisplatin. Overexpression of miR-153 had little effect on viability in the absence of
cisplatin, however protection against cell death was observed
in cells overexpressing miR-153 when treated with cisplatin
(Fig. 2E and F). These ﬁndings suggested that miR-153 may
have a dual role in colorectal cancer progression, promoting
enhanced invasiveness and chemosensitivity. Consequently
both these processes were assessed further and are described
later.
Overexpression of miR-153 leads to increased
invasiveness in colorectal cancer via MMP-9
The effect of miR-153 on colorectal cancer invasion was
tested in additional cell lines with low baseline expression of
miR-153. Transient overexpression of miR-153 in DLD-1, Ht29,
and AAC1/82 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4E) led to enhanced
invasiveness in Matrigel-coated transwell assays (Fig. 3A).
Using antimiR-153, inhibition of miR-153 in colorectal cancer
cell lines with high baseline levels of miR-153 (Supplementary
Fig. S4F) signiﬁcantly reduced invasion compared with control
(Fig. 3B) without any alteration to proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). To more closely recreate and model in
vivo circumstances, we examined the effect of stably transfected GFP-tagged miR-153 in SW480 cells using a 3-dimensional organotypic coculture of SW480 cells and human fetal
ﬁbroblast cells (Fig. 3C). Ectopic expression of miR-153 but not
control resulted in increased invasion of SW480 cells into the
underlying stroma of organotypic cultures (Fig. 3C, i and ii).
Although stable overexpression was achieved in only 50% of
cells, immunostaining against GFP illustrated enrichment of
miR-153–expressing cells at the invasive front (Fig. 3C, iii to vi).

To determine if miR-153 would stimulate invasion in vivo, we
conducted subcutaneous implantation of SW620 cells in SCID
mice. Cells were transfected with antimiR-153 or control, and
injected into opposite ﬂanks of each animal. Inhibition of miR153 resulted in more spheroid tumors with clean edges compared with control tumors with more locally invasive phenotypes (Fig. 3D). No difference in size of tumors was noted
between control and miR-153 inhibited xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Analysis of depth of invasion and number of
invasive tumor spikes into surrounding stroma and adjacent
tissue showed a signiﬁcant reduction in invasive ability of
xenografts transfected with antimiR-153 (Fig. 3E).
Our initial ﬁndings showed that miR-153 overexpression

transwell invasion assays but not in non-Matrigel-coated
assays. A principal constituent of Matrigel is type IV collagen,
which is also one of the main substrates for MMP-9 (24). MMP9 is a key effector in extracellular matrix degradation and
strongly implicated in colorectal cancer associated invasion,
with levels progressively increasing from early node-negative
to metastatic colorectal cancer, making it an optimal candidate to examine (22, 23). To test if MMP-9 may play a role in
miR-153–induced invasion, SW480 cells were transfected with
miR-153 or control miRNA and medium supernatants sampled
for MMP-9 activity. Figure 4A and B show that raised levels of
MMP-9 activity were detected after transfection with miR-153,
but not control miRNA. We also assessed levels of the other
member of the Gelatinase subfamily, MMP2, however no effect

levels of MMP-9 transcript, we examined for MMP-9 mRNA
after forced expression of miR-153 (Fig. 4E). No change in
MMP-9 mRNA was identiﬁed, indicating that increased gelatonylitic activity is not consequent to a change in MMP-9
transcript production or stability. Collectively, these studies
suggest that miR-153 may enhance invasiveness through an
increase in MMP-9 activity.
miR-153 overexpression enhances platinum-based
chemoresistance in colorectal cancer via a direct effect
on FOXO3a
Our initial functional screen identiﬁed a possible role for miR153 in mediating chemoresistance to cisplatin (Fig. 2E and F).
miRNAs are also known to have powerful regulatory effects on
viability and target pathways associated with chemosensitivity
and chemoresistance (25, 26). Although cisplatin is an effective
platinum-based antineoplastic agent with activity against a
variety of gastrointestinal and other solid tumors (27, 28), it is

infrequently used in the current management of colorectal
cancer. Conversely, oxaliplatin, a newer generation platinumbased compound, now represents a standard of care for patients
with stages III and IV colorectal cancer when combined with
ﬂuoropyrimidine-based agents (18, 28). We therefore evaluated
effect of miR-153 overexpression on both cisplatin- and oxalplatin-mediated apoptosis. Figure 5A shows that overexpressed
miR-153 had a similar effect in protecting against oxalplatinmediated apoptosis. We also examined sensitivity of SW480 and
SW620 cells to oxaliplatin. As might be predicted from the higher
levels of miR-153 in SW620 cells, SW620 cells were more resistant
to oxaliplatin-mediated apoptosis, even with high doses of
oxaliplatin (Fig. 5B; ref. 16). Upregulation of miR-153 but not
scrambled miRNA reduced abundance of activated caspase 3
when SW480 cells were treated with cisplatin, indicating that
miR-153 is functioning as an antiapoptotic factor in this context
(Fig. 5C and D). To explore gene targets of miR-153 that may
mediate this effect, we examined for putative targets using 4

microrna.org), PicTar (www.pictar.org), TargetScan (www.targetscan.org), and Diana-microTv3.0 (http://diana.cslab.ece.
ntua.gr/microT/). To reduce false positives, candidates were
only considered if they were predicted by at least 3 methods. One
candidate identiﬁed by this approach was the Forkhead/winged
helix box class O3a (FOXO3a) tumor suppressor protein. FOXO
proteins are a conserved subfamily of transcription factors and
orchestrate programs of gene expression involved in differentiation, apoptosis, and DNA damage responses. Deletion of
FOXO alleles confers a tumorigenic phenotype in mice models
(29), whereas inactivation or silencing leads to a well-described
chemoresistance to cisplatin in colon, ovarian, bladder, and oral
squamous cell carcinomas, making it an optimal target to
investigate (30–36). FOXO3a protein levels were examined in
the SW480/620 cell model, and found to inversely correlate
with miR-153 expression levels (Fig. 6A). To experimentally
verify FOXO3a as a target of miR-153, we examined the effect
of miR-153 overexpression on endogenous FOXO3a protein
levels. Figure 6B and C show a signiﬁcant reduction in FOXO3a
protein levels in different cell lines after miR-153 overexpression.
We also evaluated if miR-153 could impact the transcript levels
of FOXO3a, and noted a signiﬁcant reduction in FOXO3a mRNA
in the presence of miR-153 (Fig. 6D).

We next determined if the effect of miR-153 in promoting
colorectal cancer chemoresistance to oxaliplatin could be altered
by introduction of exogenous FOXO3a. As shown by other groups,
FOXO3a was found to mediate chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin
(Supplementary Fig. S5B; refs. 30–36). In addition, Fig. 6E shows
that overexpression of FOXO3a can reverse the observed effect of
miR-153 on oxaliplatin chemosensitivity. To determine if the
miR-153–FOXO3a interaction may also be contributing to the
enhanced invasiveness observed with miR-153 overexpression,
we ﬁrst examined the effect of FOXO3a overexpression in
mediating colorectal cancer invasiveness. Figure 6F shows that
although miR-153 can successfully mediate increased invasiveness in transwell invasion assays, overexpression or siRNAmediated inhibition of FOXO3a is unable to replicate this effect.
In addition, when FOXO3a was overexpressed in SW480 cells,
medium supernatants sampled for MMP-9 showed no increase in
MMP-9 activity compared with controls, unlike miR-153 overexpression (Fig. 6G). Similarly, other groups have noted no
changes in invasiveness or MMP-9 activity from overexpressed
wild-type FOXO3a, further supporting the hypothesis that the
observed effects of miR-153 on invasion and MMP-9 are unlikely
to be mediated through FOXO3a (30, 37).

conserved miR-153 binding site (Fig. 6H) with a 7mer-A1

seed-matched site in the 50 region of miR-153, ranking as one
of the top scoring probabilities of conserved targeting (PCT)
as described by Friedman and colleagues (38). To determine
if the effect on FOXO3a is mediated via this predicted miR153 binding site, we cloned a 542bp region of the 30 -UTR of
FOXO3a containing the single putative miR-153 binding site
downstream of the Renilla luciferase open reading frame.
Wild-type 30 -UTR and a mutant form in which the putative
seed-binding site was mutated were evaluated. As shown
in Fig. 6I, when miR-153 precursor was cotransfected with
wild-type FOXO3a 30 -UTR reporter construct, signiﬁcant
repression in activity was noted. Mutation of the miR-153
binding site eliminated the observed repression, supporting
a direct association between miR-153 and FOXO3a. Similar
results were obtained in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells,
indicating this is not unique to SW480 cells.
We next sought to determine if expression of FOXO3a was
altered in human colorectal cancer. Using a custom-designed
tissue microarray, we examined and scored the intensity and
proportion of cells staining for FOXO3a in 10 normal colorectal
mucosa samples, 10 adenomatous polyps, 20 stage 1 colorectal
cancer, and 20 stage 3/4 tumors. Representative sections are
presented in Fig. 7A and analysis of the scoring presented in Fig.
7B. FOXO3a expression was signiﬁcantly lower in advanced
cancer stages (P < 0.0005). Analysis of matched tumors for
expression of miR-153 and FOXO3a showed a signiﬁcant and

inverse correlation between miR-153 and FOXO3a (Fig. 7C; R ¼
0.75; P < 0.0001; 95% CI ¼ 0.86 to 0.52). Taken together,
these results suggest that miR-153–mediated resistance to
platinum-based chemotherapy could be mediated through
reduced levels of FOXO3a.

Discussion
Disease progression in colorectal cancer is a complex multistep process. During progression, cancer cells acquire the
ability to invade beyond normal cellular boundaries, intravasate into blood and lymphatics, journey to distant organs,
extravasate and proliferate in a different microenvironment,
concomitantly eluding antitumor host immunity and defying
chemotherapeutic agents. Although to date miRNAs have been
principally identiﬁed as mediators of tumorigenesis, emerging
data is also uncovering their role as important modulators of
different steps in metastasis and disease progression, serving
as promoters (7, 12), or inhibitors (13), of these processes.
Here we report on the pleiotropic actions of a poorly
understood miRNA, miR-153 in promoting colorectal cancer
progression. We used the SW480/SW620 cell model for colorectal cancer progression and conducted miRNA proﬁling to
identify differentially expressed miRNAs between the 2 cell
lines. One candidate identiﬁed by our screen was miR-153,
which was upregulated by over 12-fold in the more advanced
SW620 cells. miR-153 is a conserved miRNA ﬁrst detected at

miR-153 Supports Colorectal Cancer Progression

high levels in brain tissue, and implicated in development of
neurodegenerative conditions (39, 40). Intriguingly, miR-153
levels are reduced in human Glioblastoma Multiforme (41),
and increased in endometrial adenocarcinomas (42). To our
knowledge, miR-153 has not been implicated in colorectal
cancer before. To determine the relevance of this miRNA, we
examined miR-153 expression in a panel of colorectal cancer
cell lines, in human colorectal cancer tumor samples compared to normal mucosa, and subsequently across a panel of
predeﬁned colorectal cancers of different clinical stage. miR153 expression in the colorectal cancer cell lines examined in
our study showed similar expression patterns to matching
colorectal cancer lines in the NCI-60 panel, further verifying
our ﬁndings (43). miR-153 was overexpressed in tumors compared to normal tissue, and consistent with our cellular model,
expressed at higher levels in metastatic compared with nonmetastatic tumors. As the main mechanism for development of
colorectal cancer is chromosomal instability (44), and miRNAs
are overrepresented in regions of genomic copy number
change in colorectal cancer, we examined the miR-153 locus
for copy number change. Little is understood about the regulation of miR-153 and systematic evaluation of the literature
did not identify any studies describing genetic or epigenetic
regulation of miR-153 speciﬁcally. miR-153 resides in the gene
locus for the PTPRN gene, which encodes a member of the
protein tyrosine phosphatase family (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Analysis of our cell line model and the Mitelman database
suggest that copy number change in this region is a rare event
however. Intriguingly, recent data from DNA methylation
proﬁling in ovarian cancer has shown that promoter hypermethylation of the PTPRN gene is signiﬁcantly associated with
longer patient survival, supporting a model in which miR-153
silencing may be protective against disease progression (46). At
present however, no data showing coregulation of PTPRN and
miR-153 has been described.
To better understand how deregulation of miR-153 impacts
colorectal cancer, we conducted functional studies to examine
effects of ectopic miR-153 and inhibition of miR-153. We
observed 2 broad effects of miR-153 upregulation, leading to
increased cellular invasiveness, and enhanced platinum-based
chemotherapy resistance. To dissect the mechanisms behind
miR-153-mediated increase in invasiveness, we examined production of MMPs after miR-153 overexpression. The gelatinase
MMP-9 is strongly implicated in colorectal cancer progression,
and secretion is higher in metastatic murine colorectal cancer
compared with nonmetastatic tumors (45), whereas in the
SW480/620 human colorectal cancer model, MMP-9 expression is higher in metastatic SW620 cells (14). SW620 cells are
more invasive than SW480 cells in a variety of in vitro assays,
and overexpression of MMP-9 in SW480 cells leads to a more
invasive phenotype (14, 47). In addition, multiple in vivo studies
have showed increased MMP-9 transcript (23), protein (48),
and bioactivity (49) in more advanced human colorectal cancer
compared with earlier stages, and increased MMP-9 is an independent predictor of overall, cancer speciﬁc, and disease-free
survival (23, 49). In this study, we noted increased MMP-9
activity after transfection of cells with miR-153. miR-153 transfected cells showed enhanced invasion through matrigel, a

www.aacrjournals.org

basement membrane-like matrix rich in collagen type IV (the
main substrate of MMP-9), and inhibition of MMP-9 was
sufﬁcient to abrogate this effect. The mechanism by which
miR-153 upregulates MMP-9 activity remains unclear at present, however, the results of our gene set enrichment analysis for
putative miR-153 targets showed overrepresentation of a number of transcription factors, which may provide insights into this
process (Supplementary Files S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1C).
To better understand how miR-153 increases resistance to
platinum-based agents, in silico analysis was conducted with
miRNA target predicting algorithms. One candidate identiﬁed
was the FOXO3a transcription factor. Functionally, FOXO3a has
striking similarities to p53, and the 2 transcription factors share
many downstream targets (50). Although inactivating mutations
in FOXO3a in human cancer have not been described, loss-offunction of FOXO3a frequently occurs by posttranslational modiﬁcations. FOXO3a is a critical molecule in initiating apoptotic
programs, and upregulates proapoptotic genes such as Bim and
PUMA, while downregulating antiapoptotic genes (50). FOXO3a
is a well-described regulator of the response to cisplatin in several
malignancies including colorectal cancer, and silencing endogenous FOXO3a impairs cytotoxicity of this chemotherapeutic
agent (31–36). Accordingly, we tested if miR-153 could be mediating its effect through FOXO3a. Our results show a consistent
and inverse relationship between miR-153 and FOXO3a levels in
colorectal cancer cell lines and tumors, and support a model in
which tumor overexpression of miR-153 reduces FOXO3a transcript and protein levels, impairing the apoptotic response to
cisplatin, and mimicking the role of oncogenic kinases such as
Akt in inactivating FOXO3a. Our results verify that the miR-153/
FOXO3a interaction is a direct one, as miR-153 interacts with the
30 -UTR of FOXO3a through a speciﬁc seed-binding site to bring
about repression of a FOXO3a-30 -UTR luciferase fusion gene.
Expression of FOXO3a is clearly a tightly regulated process, and
our ﬁndings show that miR-153 represents a further layer of
regulation and providing further ﬁne tuning of FOXO3a function.
Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that overexpression of
miR-153 has an important and dual role in promoting disease
progression in colorectal cancer through enhanced cellular
invasion and reduced chemosensitivity. The ability of one
miRNA to have a dual function in disease promotion is not
unprecedented (14) and indeed the predicted promiscuity of
miRNAs by target prediction has long hinted at this. Such
pleiotropy also exposes opportunities for exploiting the miRNA
system for therapeutic manipulation with potential to correct
more than one corrupted pathway by targeting one molecule
only, giving added value in the design and development of any
novel-targeted therapy. Our present ﬁndings also add to the
weight of evidence incriminating miRNAs in the mechanisms
behind cancer progression and metastasis, and identify miR153 as a further molecule in the new class of "metastamirs" (51).
