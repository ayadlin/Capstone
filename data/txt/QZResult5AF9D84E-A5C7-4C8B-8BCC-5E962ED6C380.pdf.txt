Why RECIST Works and Why It Should Stay
See Counterpoint by Fojo and Noonan, p. 5151

In their article entitled "Why RECIST Works and Why It Should
Stay," Fojo and Noonan argue that alternatives to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) deﬁnitions of
response and progression would not accelerate improvements
in patient outcomes. Their case ignores the fact that the
RECIST thresholds were never directly validated for their
correlation with survival or quality of life and assumes that
proposed alternatives would "lower the bar" for efﬁcacy by
decreasing the threshold for a response or by increasing the
threshold for progression. We agree that revised thresholds for
response and progression will not improve the status quo. We
therefore proposed an entirely new paradigm that allows
"evidence of efﬁcacy" to be tailored to the drug, disease, and
patient population.
Fojo and Noonan downplay the ﬂaws of RECIST and declare
that RECIST "has been and will continue to be valuable" for "the
majority of metastatic solid tumors." However, the question
here is not whether RECIST has value but whether it is the best
tool in a growing toolbox for assessing effects of cancer
therapeutics. Tumor measurements will continue to be important to the evaluation of efﬁcacy. We contend that in many of
the settings of early testing of new agents and combinations,
longitudinal measurements should be evaluated more precisely (e.g., with volumetrics) and compared on a continuous scale.
Other quantitative tools, such as tumor density on computed
tomography (e.g., gastrointestinal stromal tumor), metabolic
activity on positron emission tomography (e.g., lymphoma),
assays for serum biomarkers (e.g., prostate-speciﬁc antigen),
and symptom or quality-of-life scores on validated scales could
further improve upon tumor size as composite endpoints.
Moertel and Hanley (1), whose work was instrumental in
advancing the ﬁeld, did not have any of these tools available
when they conducted their study of oncologists measuring
spheres. In contrast to RECIST, our proposed paradigm would
encourage the use of any or all of these tools in randomized
blinded efﬁcacy trials.
In the ﬁnal section of their article, Fojo and Noonan argue
that RECIST is "validated" by the data from oncology drugs

approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the
past 10 years. While we agree that the data are sobering
about our ability to improve patient outcomes, it is erroneous to conclude that these modest gains are proof that
RECIST is the best approach and to assume that alternative
approaches would lead to more marginal gains. Indeed, an
alternative interpretation is that a RECIST-based approach
to drug development has failed to make major gains, and
there is little to be lost (and potentially much to be gained)
by trying something new. The list is even more sobering
when one considers that many of these drugs have been
approved for the same indication (e.g., 7 drugs for ﬁrst- or
second-line advanced renal cancer) and rarely compared
directly. Our proposed paradigm might motivate sponsors of
efﬁcacy trials to answer the real question that oncologists
and patients want to know: "Which therapy has the greatest
evidence of efﬁcacy for a given patient?"
