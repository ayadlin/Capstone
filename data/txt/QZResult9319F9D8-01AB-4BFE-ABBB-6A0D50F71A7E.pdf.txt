Abstract
The anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are important targets for cancer
chemotherapy. Specific and potent inhibitors of the BCL-2 family, such as ABT-263
(navitoclax) and ABT-199, are only effective against some members of the BCL-2
family but do not target MCL-1, which is commonly amplified in tumors and associated
with chemoresistance. In this report, the selectivity and potency of two putative
MCL-1 inhibitors, dinaciclib and maritoclax, were assessed. Although both compounds
induced Bax/Bak- and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis, dinaciclib was more potent
than maritoclax in downregulating MCL-1 and also in inducing apoptosis. However,
the compounds induced apoptosis, even in cells lacking MCL-1, suggesting multiple
mechanisms of cell death. Furthermore, maritoclax induced extensive mitochondrial
fragmentation, and a Bax/Bak- but MCL-1-independent accumulation of mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (ROS), with an accompanying loss of complexes I and III
of the electron transport chain. ROS scavengers, such as MitoQ, could not salvage
maritoclax-mediated effects on mitochondrial structure and function. Taken together,
our data demonstrate that neither dinaciclib nor maritoclax exclusively target MCL1. Although dinaciclib is clearly not a specific MCL-1 inhibitor, its ability to rapidly
downregulate MCL-1 may be beneficial in many clinical settings, where it may reverse
chemoresistance or sensitize to other chemotherapeutic agents.

Introduction

BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-w, whereas a related analogue,
ABT-199 selectively inhibits BCL-2, and not BCL-XL,
thus circumventing a dose-limiting thrombocytopenia,
associated with BCL-XL inhibition [4-10]. Although
these inhibitors have recently entered clinical trials for
the treatment of various hematological malignancies, the
effectiveness of these agents in several cancers is often
limited by chemoresistance, which has most commonly
been ascribed to high expression levels of other antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members, particularly MCL-1 [7,
8, 10-15]. Several putative inhibitors of MCL-1 have been
reported in the literature, although to our knowledge, none
of the compounds appear to be selective or sufficiently
potent inhibitors of MCL-1, at least in a cellular context
[16].
The lower affinity of commonly available BCL-2

Evasion of apoptosis is one of the key hallmarks
of cancer [1]. Most cancer chemotherapeutic agents kill
cancer cells by induction of apoptosis through perturbation
of mitochondria and induction of the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis [2, 3]. Major efforts have been made over the
last decade to develop small molecule inhibitors of the
anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family of proteins,
which are highly expressed in some cancers and are
known to regulate mitochondrial membrane integrity.
Although development of such inhibitors has proved
particularly difficult due to the necessity to inhibit proteinprotein interactions, some success has been achieved.
Most notable is the case of ABT-737 and its orally active
analogue, ABT-263 (Navitoclax), both of which inhibit

antagonists to bind and inhibit MCL-1 has been attributed
to structural differences in the BH3-binding grove of
MCL-1 compared with other BCL-2 family members.
Moreover, drugs, such as obatoclax and sabutoclax, that
have been reported to displace pro-apoptotic BCL-2
family proteins from MCL-1 lack the specificity to induce
MCL-1-dependent apoptosis and are more toxic in cellular
models [9, 16, 17]. Similarly, stapled peptides designed
to specifically bind the hydrophobic groove of MCL-1
and mimic BH3-only members are yet to demonstrate
the desired potency in inducing apoptosis in vivo [18-20].
In view of the difficulty in designing a specific MCL-1
inhibitor, other approaches are being used in particular
to exploit the known short half-life of MCL-1. Thus,
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, flavopiridol,
roscovitine and seliciclib, which transcriptionally
suppress MCL-1, and sorafenib, which diminishes MCL1 translation, show some promise [13, 14, 21]. Likewise,
small molecule inhibitors of deubiquitinases, such as
USP9X, offer alternative approaches to tackle MCL-1mediated chemoresistance [22, 23].
In this manuscript, we assess the selectivity and
potency of two putative MCL-1 inhibitors that inhibit
MCL-1 by distinct mechanisms. One of these inhibitors is
marinopyrrole A (maritoclax), which directly binds MCL1 and targets it for proteasomal degradation in various
haematological cancer cells and some melanoma cells
[24-26]. In contrast, dinaciclib is a broad-spectrum CDK
inhibitor, and has been shown to downregulate MCL1 levels, most likely due to transcriptional repression
[27-29]. In this study, we show that both dinaciclib and
maritoclax induce apoptosis in MEFs and non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. While dinaciclib
is much more potent in downregulating MCL-1 levels,
MCL-1 loss by maritoclax is relatively modest. The
induction of apoptosis in a MCL-1-dependent manner
by both compounds is clearly cell-type specific, as both
compounds induce apoptosis in MEFs irrespective of
MCL-1 status. In addition to driving the proteasomal
turnover of MCL-1, maritoclax also alters the structural
and functional integrity of mitochondria and leads to the
accumulation of mitochondrial ROS.

members have been designed to release the sequestered
pro-apoptotic members, which then can induce a Bax/
Bak-dependent release of cytochrome c and subsequent
activation of caspase-9-mediated apoptosis. In this
study, we use dinaciclib and maritoclax, two structurally
dissimilar compounds, that antagonize MCL-1 activity
by distinct mechanisms [24-27, 29, 30]. Substitution
of the two side chain hydroxyl groups in maritoclax
with methoxy groups results in an inactive variant,
dimethoxymaritoclax [31] (Fig. 1A). In MEFs that are
either wild type, or deficient in Bax and Bak (DKO) or
caspase-9 (caspase-9 null), both dinaciclib and maritoclax
induced a concentration-dependent apoptosis in a manner
that was completely dependent on Bax/ Bak and caspase-9
(Fig. 1B). However, dinaciclib appeared more potent
than maritoclax, in inducing apoptosis at nanomolar
concentrations, whereas concentrations of maritoclax as
high as 3 µM induced only modest levels of cell death
(Fig. 1B). The dependence on Bax and Bak to induce
apoptosis following maritoclax and dinaciclib did not
persist for more than 24 h, as prolonged exposure (72 h)
to both maritoclax and dinaciclib resulted in a gradual
induction of apoptosis even in DKO cells (Fig. 1C).

Dinaciclib and maritoclax induce apoptosis in
cells that depend on MCL-1 for survival
Since dinaciclib and maritoclax have been shown
to target MCL-1 synthesis and degradation respectively,
we examined their efficacy in inducing apoptosis in three
MCL-1-dependent NSCLC cell lines, H23, H460 and
H1299 (Figs. 1D-1F). H23 and H460 are dependent on
MCL-1 for survival [15], whereas H1299 is dependent
on both MCL-1 and BCL-XL for survival [16]. Therefore,
we used RNA interference to silence the expression of
BCL-XL, thus rendering the H1299 cell line solely MCL1-dependent. Both dinaciclib and maritoclax caused a
concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis in the
NSCLC cell lines, whereas dimethoxymaritoclax failed to
induce apoptosis, even at 30 µM (Figs. 1D-1F). However
as in the MEFs, dinaciclib was significantly more potent
than maritoclax at inducing apoptosis (Figs. 1D-1F).
Thus the ability to induce apoptosis in several MCL-1dependent cell lines supported the hypothesis that both
dinaciclib and maritoclax targeted MCL-1 and resulted in
cell death.

apoptosis in MCL-1-addictive cell lines, the mechanisms
by which the compounds inhibit MCL-1 are quite distinct.

2 h and was almost complete at 8 h (Fig. 2A). Dinaciclib
also resulted in a time-dependent, near-complete loss of
BIM and NOXA, but the loss of BAK was more modest
(Fig. 2A). The loss of MCL-1 and its interacting partners
preceded the cleavage of the canonical caspase substrate,
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Fig. 2A).
Maritoclax resulted in a much more modest loss of MCL1, which, at later time points, was not just restored but
resulted in protein levels higher than control cells (Fig.
2A). However, maritoclax also resulted in PARP cleavage
at 16-24 h (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the early loss of
MCL-1 was sufficient to trigger apoptotic events in these
cells. Next, we wished to assess if this early loss of MCL1 could synergize with BCL-2 family inhibitors, such as
navitoclax, which inhibit BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-w, but
not MCL-1, in enhancing apoptosis. For this experiment,
we used H1299 cells, which depend on BCL-XL and

MCL-1 for survival [16]. Pretreatment of H1299 cells for
30 min with navitoclax greatly enhanced the ability of
dinaciclib to induce apoptosis (Fig. 2B). This potentiation
of apoptosis was accompanied by the total loss of MCL1 and significant PARP cleavage (Figs. 2B and 2C). In
marked contrast, the extent of apoptosis induction, as
evidenced by PARP processing and PS externalization,
in cells exposed to navitoclax and maritoclax, was more
modest (Figs. 2B and 2C). These observations suggest that
a complete loss of MCL-1, as observed with dinaciclib,
may be required to observe synergy with navitoclax.

Dinaciclib and maritoclax can induce apoptosis in
a MCL-1-independent manner

results suggested that, at least in MEFs, the majority of
cell death induced by dinaciclib occurred irrespective of
MCL-1 status. In marked contrast, maritoclax induced
more cell death in the MCL-1-deficient than wild type
MEFs (Fig. 2D), suggesting that although maritoclax
may preferentially target MCL-1, it clearly can induce
apoptosis through other mechanisms. To avoid incorrect
interpretations from possible gene compensation that may
have occurred following MCL-1 knockdown, we wished
to confirm these results in MCL-1f/f Rosa-ERCreT2 MEFs,
in which endogenous MCL-1 undergoes rapid deletion
following exposure to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) [32].
Exposure to 4-HT for 24 h was sufficient to deplete MCL1 levels in these cells, and the response to dinaciclib was

Since dinaciclib and maritoclax induced MCL-1dependent apoptosis in the MCL-1-addictive NSCLC
cell lines, we wished to assess if targeting MCL-1 was
the predominant mechanism by which these compounds
induced apoptosis. For this, we used wild type and MCL1-deficient MEFs, which do not rely on MCL-1 for
survival [32]. Dinaciclib (≤ 100 nM) induced similar levels
of apoptosis in both wild type and MCL-1-deficient MEFs,
whereas at higher concentrations (> 100 nM), apoptosis
occurred in a MCL-1-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). These

fairly similar to our previous data in MCL-1-deficient
MEFs (Fig. 2E). However, maritoclax behaved differently
in these cells and induced significant cell death even in the
presence of MCL-1 (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data
suggest that dinaciclib and maritoclax, despite causing
rapid loss of MCL-1, can also induce apoptosis in a MCL1-independent manner.

MCL-1-independent manner, these compounds exerted
apoptosis in a Bax/Bak and caspase-9-dependent manner
(Fig. 1B). Moreover, dinaciclib and maritoclax caused a
time-dependent release of cytochrome c (Fig. 3A), with
a concomitant loss in mitochondrial membrane potential
(Fig. 3B) and an increase in PS externalization (Fig. 3C).
As these observations placed the immediate effects of
dinaciclib and maritoclax at the level of mitochondria,
we wished to assess if the compounds modulated other
anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family, which
may in turn result in apoptosis. In H460 cells, none of
the anti-apoptotic members such as BCL-2, BCL-XL or
BCL-w were downregulated following either dinaciclib

fragmentation (Figs. 4A and 4B). Exposure to dinaciclib
also resulted in mitochondrial structural changes, although
these effects were more subtle (Figs. 4A and 4B).
Maritoclax-mediated mitochondrial structural changes
accompanied a time-dependent loss both in MFN1 and also
in the high molecular weight isoforms of OPA1 but did
not alter DRP1 levels, suggesting a loss in mitochondrial
fusion (Fig. 4C). Exposure to dinaciclib did not cause
similar changes in the expression levels of mitochondrial
fission-fusion proteins (Fig. 4C). Previously, we
speculated that MCL-1 mediated changes in mitochondrial
membrane dynamics could possibly exhibit a cross-talk in
the cell death pathway induced by MCL-1 inhibitors [33].
To test our hypothesis, we silenced the expression levels
of different mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins, and
assessed the extent of cell death following exposure to

Maritoclax, but not dinaciclib, results in extensive
mitochondrial fragmentation
Although dinaciclib and maritoclax caused a timedependent release of cytochrome c (Fig. 3A), our data
suggested that these compounds might alter mitochondrial
structure and/ or function, in an analogous manner
to other putative MCL-1 inhibitors [33]. Exposure to
maritoclax resulted in rapid mitochondrial swelling,
which subsequently lead to extensive mitochondrial

either maritoclax or dinaciclib. Downregulation of DRP1,
OPA1 or MFN1 failed to exhibit any positive influence
on maritoclax or dinaciclib-mediated cell death (Fig.
4D), whereas silencing of MFN2 was toxic even in the
absence of the inhibitors and no additive/ synergistic
effect was observed in combination with either dinaciclib
or maritoclax (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that MCL1 possibly regulates mitochondrial fusion dynamics and
apoptosis by independent mechanisms, in agreement with
previous reports [32].

Maritoclax-mediated
accumulation
of
mitochondrial ROS, but not membrane
fragmentation, occurs in a Bax/ Bak-dependent
manner
Although
maritoclax-mediated
effects
on
mitochondrial fragmentation and ROS accumulation were
consistent with the purported roles of MCL-1, we wished
to assess whether maritoclax induced such changes in a
Bax/ Bak- and MCL-1- dependent manner. Maritoclax
induced extensive mitochondrial fragmentation in both
DKO and MCL-1 null MEFs, to a similar extent as their
wild type counterparts (Fig. 6A), thus suggesting that
maritoclax-induced mitochondrial fragmentation occurred
irrespective of Bax/ Bak and MCL-1 status. In agreement
with the microscopic observation of mitochondrial
fragmentation, maritoclax resulted in a loss of high
molecular weight isoforms of OPA1 in cells that lacked
either Bax/Bak or MCL-1 (Fig. 6B). However, the loss of
ETC components observed following maritoclax in wild
type cells, seem to diminish in the DKO cells, suggesting
an involvement of Bax/Bak in accelerating maritoclaxmediated loss of ETC components (Fig. 6B). Maritoclaxmediated rapid accumulation of mitochondrial ROS also
occurred in a Bax/Bak-dependent manner, which raised the
possibility that the mitochondrial ROS were responsible
for the loss of the ETC components (Fig. 6C). However,
a similar extent of protection either from the loss of ETC
components or mitochondrial ROS accumulation was not
observed in the MCL-1 null MEFs, thus ruling out MCL-1

induces

In addition to its proposed role in regulating
mitochondrial fusion, MCL-1 is also proposed to
regulate mitochondrial homeostasis [32]. We therefore
hypothesized that the dramatic changes in mitochondrial
ultrastructure should also disrupt mitochondrial function.
Maritoclax, but not dinaciclib, resulted in a significant
time-dependent loss of certain components of complexes
I and III of the electron transport chain (Fig. 5A). Both
these complexes have been implicated in the generation of
ROS [34]. Furthermore, maritoclax but not dinaciclib, also
resulted in a similar depletion of ROMO1 (Fig. 5A), which
was recently recognized as a sensor for mitochondrial
ROS [35]. Consistent with these observations, maritoclax
resulted in a rapid accumulation of mitochondrial
ROS, as assessed by mitosoxRed staining (Fig. 5B). In
contrast, exposure to dinaciclib caused little or no buildup of mitochondrial ROS at the initial time points and an
increase was only observed at later times (16-24 h) (Fig.

in these events (Figs. 6B and 6D). Moreover, maritoclax
induced a greater accumulation of mitochondrial ROS in
cells lacking MCL-1 (Fig. 6D), similar to the cell death
effects observed in these cells (Fig. 2D).

of these inhibitors have demonstrated significant potency
and/or specificity in a cellular context [16]. In this study,
we evaluate the potency and specificity of dinaciclib and
maritoclax, both of which exert MCL-1 inhibition via
distinct mechanisms [24-26, 29, 30]. Our data indicate that
both maritoclax and dinaciclib efficiently downregulate
the expression levels of MCL-1 and induce death in a Bax/
Bak- and caspase-9-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2).
Dinaciclib is a broad-spectrum CDK inhibitor
and is currently in clinical trials to treat several cancers
[27,28,37-41]. Owing to its ability to inhibit multiple
CDKs, dinaciclib could attenuate the expression levels of
several short-lived proteins, such as MCL-1, which may
in turn trigger the apoptotic cascade in several cancers.
Apoptosis mediated by BCL-2 family antagonists is
believed to result in release of pro-apoptotic members,
such as BIM and NOXA, which subsequently induce
apoptosis. In our experiments, dinaciclib decreased the
expression levels not only of MCL-1 but also of BIM
and NOXA (Fig. 2). Thus dinaciclib appears to mediate
apoptosis in a BIM- and NOXA-independent but a Bax/
Bak-dependent manner. Moreover, dinaciclib induced
apoptosis irrespective of MCL-1 expression levels (Figs.
2D and 2E), demonstrating that the apoptotic effects
of dinaciclib can occur in a MCL-1-dependent and
independent manner and cannot be attributed solely to
MCL-1 downregulation.
Although dinaciclib is clearly not a specific MCL1 inhibitor, its ability to rapidly downregulate MCL-1
in several cell types, may clearly be beneficial in many
clinical settings, where it may reverse chemoresistance or
sensitize to other chemotherapeutic agents, such as ABT199 or navitoclax. Furthermore, the ability of dinaciclib
to inhibit the transcription of other short-lived proteins,
which may also regulate cell death, could be beneficial.
In this regard, dinaciclib is currently in a number of early
clinical trials either alone or in combination with various
chemotherapeutic agents including capecitabine, erlotinib,
carboplatin and bortezomib to evaluate its efficacy in
various malignancies, including non-small cell lung
cancer, triple negative breast cancer, pancreatic cancer,
melanoma, multiple myeloma and refractory chronic
lymphocytic leukemia [42].
Unlike dinaciclib, maritoclax has been shown
to specifically target MCL-1 for proteasomal
degradation in experimental models of melanoma and
various haematological malignancies [24-26]. In our
studies, maritoclax was not as potent as dinaciclib in
downregulating MCL-1 and inducing apoptosis (Figs. 1
and 2). Moreover, the loss of MCL-1 following maritoclax
was transient in H460 cells, as levels of MCL-1 were even
elevated at later times through an unknown mechanism
(Fig. 2A). In contrast, a time-dependent reduction of Mcl1 was observed in H1299 cells (Fig. 2C) and MEFs (Fig.
6B) treated with maritoclax. Maritoclax induced more cell
death in MEFs deficient in MCL-1 compared with the wild

MitoQ does not prevent maritoclax-mediated
mitochondrial effects
To assess if maritoclax-mediated accumulation
of mitochondrial ROS preceded the loss in complexes
I and III, we attempted to scavenge mitochondrial ROS
using MitoQ [36]. Pretreatment with MitoQ (10 µM)
for 4 hour was necessary to partially rescue the ROS
(Fig. 7A), which in turn partially prevented the loss of
NDUFB8 component of complex I (Fig. 7B). No such
protection was observed against the loss of NDUFA9
and UQCRC2, as MitoQ appeared to hasten the loss of
these components, both in the presence and absence of
maritoclax (Fig. 7B). Moreover, the protective effect of
MitoQ against the loss of these components was shortlived, as it failed to sustain its protective effects at later
times (16 h), both with respect to preventing the loss of
complexes and in rescuing maritoclax-mediated ROS
accumulation (Fig. 7B & 7C). In fact, MitoQ appeared
to enhance the extent of dinaciclib-mediated ROS
accumulation at 16 h, suggesting that prolonged exposure
to high concentrations of MitoQ could not mimic the
protective responses, observed at earlier time points
(Fig. 7C). The inability of MitoQ to sustain its protective
effects precluded its valid use to examine the role if
any of ROS in maritoclax-induced apoptosis. Although
MitoQ failed to prevent ROS accumulation at later times,
it was still effective in partially rescuing the effects at
2 h of exposure to maritoclax (Fig. 7A). Therefore, we
wished to assess if scavenging maritoclax-mediated ROS
accumulation could reverse maritoclax-mediated effects
on mitochondrial structure. Pretreatment with MitoQ not
only failed to prevent maritoclax-mediated mitochondrial
swelling and fragmentation, but also resulted in excessive
mitochondrial fragmentation, on its own, independent of
maritoclax (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
Enhanced expression levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2
family proteins in several cancers make them promising
targets for drug therapy. Small molecule inhibitors
targeting specific members of the BCL-2 family, such
as navitoclax (BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-w) and ABT-199
(BCL-2 specific) are currently in clinical trials. These
inhibitors are however ineffective against MCL-1, which
is commonly amplified in human tumours and associated
with tumour relapse and chemoresistance. Although
several reports claiming the discovery of novel inhibitors
of MCL-1 have been published, to our knowledge, none

Figure 7: Maritoclax-mediated mitochondrial effects are partially rescued by MitoQ. (A) H460 cells were exposed to
different concentrations of MitoQ for 4 h, followed by maritoclax (3 µM) for a further 2 h, and mitochondrial accumulation of ROS assessed.
Statistical analysis was conducted using a paired t-test (*P < 0.05, ns – not significant, if P > 0.05). (B) Whole cell lysates from H460
cells, exposed to MitoQ (10 µM) for 4 h followed by maritoclax (3 µM) for the indicated times, were immunoblotted with the indicated
antibodies. (C) H460 cells exposed to MitoQ (10 µM) for 4 h, followed by either Maritoclax (3 µM) or dinaciclib (30 nM) for a further 20
h were stained with MitosoxRed to monitor changes in mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Error bars represent the Mean ± SEM from three
independent experiments. (D) H460 cells, grown on coverslips, were exposed for 4 h to MitoQ (10 µM), followed by maritoclax (3 µM)
for the indicated times. The cells were then immunostained with HSP60 antibody and subjected to confocal microscopy. Scale bar – 10
µm. (E) Scheme for proposed mechanism of action of dinaciclib and maritoclax. Dinaciclib and maritoclax interfere with the anti-apoptotic
effects of MCL-1, in a Bax/Bak and caspase-9-dependent manner, by causing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ϕm) and
activation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in apoptosis. Maritoclax, but not dinaciclib, interfered
with other functions of MCL-1, including the postulated regulation of mitochondrial fusion, accompanied by enhanced OPA1 proteolysis
and loss in MFN1, all of which resulted in mitochondrial structural changes that initially manifested as swelling and subsequently resulted
in extensive mitochondrial fragmentation. However, maritoclax-mediated changes in mitochondrial structure also occurred in cells lacking
MCL-1, suggesting the involvement of MCL-1-independent mechanisms in these processes. Maritoclax also resulted in ROS generation
in mitochondria, which accompanied a loss in several components of the electron transport chain, in a Bax/Bak-dependent but a MCL-1independent manner, thus placing Bax/Bak upstream to mitochondrial ROS induction and the loss of ETC components.

type MEFs (Fig. 2C), possibly due to its sequestration by
MCL-1 thereby resulting in less free maritoclax to induce
apoptosis by other mechanisms. These results suggest
that the ability of maritoclax to induce Mcl-1-dependent
apoptosis may be cell type dependent, in agreement with
a recent report [43].
In addition to its conventional role in apoptosis,
MCL-1 has been implicated in other cellular functions
ranging from the regulation of ER and mitochondrial
membrane dynamics to mitochondrial bioenergetics [33,
44-47]. Inhibitors of MCL-1 have resulted in extensive
mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodelling,
which have been attributed to a loss of fusion rather than
enhanced mitochondrial fission [9, 33]. Furthermore,
accumulation of mitochondrial ROS, a significant
decrease in ATP production and a near complete loss of
the components of electron transport chain have all been
associated with MCL-1 inhibition [32, 33]. Consistent
with these reports, maritoclax, but not dinaciclib
interfered with mitochondrial fusion and function (Figs.
4 and 5), which may be due to the distinct mechanisms
by which dinaciclib and maritoclax downregulate MCL1. However, maritoclax induced extensive mitochondrial
fragmentation and OPA1 proteolysis even in cells lacking
MCL-1, suggesting that maritoclax-induced mitochondrial
fragmentation occurred irrespective of MCL-1 status
(Fig. 6). Similarly, the loss of ETC components and
accumulation of mitochondrial ROS also occurred in
a MCL-1-independent manner, thus confirming that
maritoclax-mediated mitochondrial changes may not be
due entirely to MCL-1 downregulation. Nevertheless,
the loss of ETC components and the rapid accumulation
of mitochondrial ROS, following maritoclax, occurred
in a Bax/Bak-dependent manner, thus placing Bax/Bak
upstream to mitochondrial ROS induction and the loss of
ETC components.
Moreover, attempts to rescue mitochondrial
ROS with several ROS scavengers, including SS31,
N-acetylcysteine, Tiron, Mn(III)TBAP and EUK134 were
ineffective, and only a partial protection was achieved by
MitoQ (Fig. 7 and data not shown). Despite the partial
rescue, MitoQ failed to prevent mitochondrial structural
and functional changes (Fig. 7). In fact, MitoQ alone,
resulted in significant mitochondrial fragmentation
suggesting other off-target effects (Fig. 7D). Therefore
presently, it is difficult to assess if maritoclax-mediated
increase in mitochondrial ROS and/or a loss in
mitochondrial membrane fusion could be directly linked
to MCL-1 regulated death. Further insights into the
mechanisms by which MCL-1 regulates these disparate
functions are required for us to definitely delineate a
potential crosstalk among these responses (Fig. 7E).
