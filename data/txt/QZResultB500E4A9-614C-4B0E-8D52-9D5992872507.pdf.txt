BACKGROUND: The role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in gastric carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. The
authors studied the effects of zinc finger E-box binding factor 1 (ZEB1) on latent-lytic switch of EBV infection in
gastric cancer and explored the importance of EBV in gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: Loss or gain of ZEB1 function was obtained by ZEB1 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down or forced ZEB1 re-expression. Cell growth was
evaluated by cell viability and colony formation assays, and the cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry. EBV was
detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization analyses. RESULTS: ZEB1
knock-down in a latent EBV-infected gastric cancer cell line (YCC10) increased lytic gene BamHI W leftward reading
frame 1 (BZLF1) expression and decreased the expression of latent gene EB nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) concomitant
with the inhibition of cell viability (P < .05) and S-phase DNA synthesis (P < .01). ZEB1 depletion combined with
ganciclovir revealed a further reduction in cell viability (P < .001). ZEB1 knock-down induced cell apoptosis and the
up-regulation of caspase 3 and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of ZEB1 in a lytic EBV-infected gastric cancer cell line (AGS-EBV) inhibited BZLF1 promoter (Zp) activity,
BZLF1 expression, and apoptosis and promoted cell growth. EBV infection was detected in 11.3% (80 of 711) of gastric
cancers. The presence of EBV was associated with age, men, and intestinal type cancer. CONCLUSIONS: ZEB1
was confirmed as a key mediator of the latent-lytic switch of EBV-associated gastric cancer, a distinct subtype with
different clinicopathologic features. The current results indicated that inhibition of ZEB1 may be a potential target for

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been established as an infective agent that causes gastric cancer.1 EBV infection has 2 distinct forms, latent infection and lytic infection in host cells, which can be distinguished by the different expression of EBV
genes.2 However, EBV-infected tumor cells almost always are latently infected. Latent EBV infection is characterized by
the minimal expression of viral genes essential for its persistence. Such an immune-escape strategy enables the virus to
remain dormant within the host cells.3

Epstein-Barr Virus in Gastric Cancer/Zhao et al

The lytic replication of EBV is initiated only after
the expression of 1 of the EBV intermediate-early genes,
BamHI W leftward reading frame 1 (BZLF1) or
BRLF1. Induction of lytic EBV infection results in host
cell killing.4 BZLF1 encodes the transcription factor
EB1, which functions as a transcriptional activator of viral genes essential for lytic replication.5 During latency,
BZLF1 is not expressed. Overexpression of the BZLF1
gene is sufficient to convert cells from a latent form to a
lytic form of viral infection.6 Thus, the regulation of
BZLF1 expression is crucial to the life cycle of the virus.
Recently, zinc finger E-box binding factor (ZEB1) was
identified as the transcriptional repressor pivotal for the
silencing of BZLF1 promoter (Zp),7,8 indicating that
the aberrant regulation of ZEB1 expression in tumor
cells may have an important influence on EBV dormancy and persistence. ZEB1, as a key regulator of
latent-lytic switch of EBV infection, may be developed
into a novel molecular target for the prevention and
treatment of EBV-related gastric cancers.9,10 However,
the mechanism of whether and how ZEB1 regulates the
latent-lytic switch of the EBV life cycle in EBV-associated gastric cancer and the role of EBV in gastric carcinogenesis in Chinese remain largely unknown. In the
current study, we evaluated the effect of ZEB1 on
modulating the latent-lytic switch of EBV infection in
gastric cancer cells and explored the potential of ZEB1
as a novel molecular target for EBV-associated gastric
cancer. We also addressed the clinical importance of the
presence of EBV infection in gastric carcinogenesis in a
large-scale cohort of Chinese patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines
AGS is a gastric carcinoma cell line, and Akata is an
EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line. The AGSEBV cell line (a gift from Shannon C. Kenney at the
Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) was obtained from 100-l/
mL hygromycin selection of AGS cells that were
infected with a recombinant Akata virus in which a
hygromycin resistance cassette had been inserted into
the nonessential BDLF3 open reading frame.9 The
human gastric cancer cell line YCC10 was naturally
infected with EBV (a gift from Dr Qian Tao from the
Department of Clinical Oncology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong).

Primary Gastric Cancer and Noncancer
Tissue Samples
Gastric cancer tissues were obtained from 711 patients
with primary gastric cancer in the First Affiliated Hospital
of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou from January
1999 to December 2006. The median patient age was 58
years, and the cohort included 485 men and 226 women.
In addition, 97 gastric tissues with precancerous lesions
(intestinal metaplasia and/or atrophic gastritis) and
24 normal gastric tissues were collected. Among 711
patients with gastric cancer, 555 were followed regularly,
and their median survival was 40.1 months (range, 0.297.6 months). In total, 239 patients (43.06%) patients
died during follow-up. All patients and controls provided
informed consent for participation in this study, and the
study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research
Ethics Committee of the Sun Yat-sen University of
Medical Sciences.
Knockdown of ZEB1 by RNA Interference
YCC10 cell lines were transfected with small interfering
RNA (siRNA) against ZEB1 (ZEB1-siRNA) or with control siRNA at 50 nM, 100 nM, or 200 nM for 72 hours
using an oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, Calif). In some experiments, YCC10 cells (5 
103 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plate and transfected with ZEB1-siRNA or control siRNA 1 day before
the cells were treated with or without antivirus the
prodrug ganciclovir (GCV) (10 mg/mL). The cells were
harvested after incubation with or without GCV for
48 hours.
Construction of ZEB1 Expression Vector
A mammalian expression vector pCI-neo-ZEB1 encoding
the full-length open reading frame of the human ZEB1
gene was a gift from Dr. Jennifer Richer (Department of
Pathology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Aurora, Colo). The sequence corresponding to the
open reading frame clone of ZEB1 was amplified and verified by DNA sequencing.
Ectopic Expression of ZEB1 in the AGS-EBV
Gastric Cancer Cell Line
The lytic EBV-infected AGS cell line AGS-EBV (5  105
cells each) were transfected with 2 lg of either ZEB1expressing plasmid or empty plasmid as a control using
Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen).
The transfection efficiency of ZEB1 was evaluated
by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction

(Becton Dickinson, San Diego, Calif). All experiments
were performed in triplicate.

Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability was measured by using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay according to
the manufacturer’s instruction (Promega, Madison,
Wis). Each experiment was performed in triplicate.

Cell Apoptosis Assay
Cell apoptosis was determined by dual staining with
annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and PI
(Invitrogen). Annexin V/FITC and PI were added to the
cellular suspension, and sample fluorescence of 10,000
cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson).
All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Luciferase Reporter Activity Assay
The promoter construct pGL3-Zp containing the BZLF1
promoter sequences of EBV strain B95.8 from nucleotide
(nt) 222 to nt þ57 was cloned into the luciferase
reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, Wis).
AGS-EBV cells transfected with pCI-neo-ZEB1 or pCIneo vector (1  105 cells per well) in 24-well plates were
cotransfected with luciferase reporter plasmid (0.5 lg per
well) and pRL-cytomegalovirus vector (5 ng per well)
using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 72 hours post-transfection, and luciferase activity
was quantified using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System
(Promega). All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Colony-Formation Assay
AGS-EBV cells (5  105 per well) were seeded onto a
6-well plate and transfected with pCI-neo-ZEB1 expression vector or pCI-neo empty vector (2 lg each) using
Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen).
Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were collected, plated at appropriate density onto a 6-well plate,
and subjected to G418 (0.5 mg/mL) selection (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) for 2 weeks. Surviving colonies
(>50 cells per colony) were counted after staining with
Gentian Violet (ICM Pharma, Singapore). All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cell Cycle Analysis
Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry.
After 12 hours of synchronization by serum starvation,
the transfected YCC10 cells with siRNA-ZEB1 plasmid
or control siRNA were restimulated with 10% fetal
bovine serum for 72 hours. The cells were sorted by using
a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ)
after being stained with propidium iodide (PI), and cell
cycle profiles were analyzed using the ModFitLT software

RNA Isolation, Semiquantitative RT-PCR, and
Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using TRIzol
Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati,
Ohio). Combinational DNA was synthesized from 2 lg
total RNA, and messenger RNA expression of ZEB1,
BZLF1, and nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) in cell lines was
examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR with the specific
primers listed in Table 1.

DNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR
Quantitation of EBV-DNA
Genomic DNA was extracted from gastric tissues using the
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Levels of EBV DNA were measured using 2 real-time quantitative PCR systems with the BamHI-W Taqman probe
targeting the BamHI-W fragment region and the EBNA1
Taqman probe targeting the EBNA1 region of the EBV
genome (Table 2).11,12 The gene copy number from the
EBV-positive cell line Namalwa was used as a standard.11
Quantification of EBV DNA concentration was determined
using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied
Biosystems, Foster, City, Calif). Results were expressed as
the number of EBV genome copies per 105 cells.12
Western Blot Analysis
Forty micrograms of protein were separated by 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred onto equilibrated polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire,
United Kingdom) by electroblotting. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, Calif) overnight at 4 C. After incubation with
the secondary antibody, proteins were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham, La Jolla, Calif).
In Situ Hybridization for EBV-Encoded
Small RNA
To confirm the existence of EBV in gastric cancer cell lines
and in gastric cancer tissues, detection of EBV-encoded small

hybridization kit (Novocastra, Newcastle, United Kingdom).
The sections were hybridized to the fluorescein-conjugated
probes. A hybridization reaction was detected by incubation
with antifluorescein antibody tagged with alkaline phosphatase. The color reaction was performed with nitroblue tetrazolium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate
solution, and the sections were counterstained with 0.1%
methyl green. Positive in situ hybridization results for EBER
were indicated by a dark brown color in cell nuclei.
Immunohistochemistry for ZEB1
ZEB1 protein expression was detected in paraffin-embedded sections of 15 EBV-positive gastric cancers and
50 EBV-negative gastric cancers using the specific antibody (1:25 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an
avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method.
Negative controls were run by replacing the primary antibody with nonimmune serum.
Statistical Analysis
The results were expressed as means  standard deviations. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare
variables between the 2 sample groups. The correlation
between EBV viral load data measured with the BamHIW region PCR and data measured with the EBNA1 PCR
was studied by using the Spearman bivariate correlation
test. Selection of a cutoff value was based on the receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The association
between patient characteristics and EBV status was analyzed with the chi-square test. Overall survival in relation
to EBV status was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier
survival curves and the log-rank test. All analyses were
performed using the SAS for Windows software package
(version 9; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All tests of
statistical significance were 2-sided, and P values < .05
were considered statistically significant.

EBV-infected gastric cancer cell line YCC10 (Fig. 1A) was
investigated through knock-down ZEB1 with siRNA.

cells compared with the control siRNA-treated cells (Fig.
1C). We also investigated the effect of ZEB1 on the
expression of EBNA1, a well known marker for latent
EBV infection. EBNA1 expression was inhibited significantly by ZEB1 knockdown (Fig. 1D), as expected. These
data provide evidence that ZEB1 plays an essential role in
maintaining EBV latency in EBV-positive gastric cancer
cells and that ZEB1 depletion can induce the lytic form of
EBV infection in gastric cancer cell.
Knockdown of ZEB1 Induced Significant
Suppression of Cell Proliferation and Cell
Cycle Arrest in the YCC10 Cell Line
The effect of ZEB1 knockdown on cell viability of YCC10
cells also was examined by MTS assay. We observed that
ZEB1 knockdown caused approximately 20% inhibition in
cell numbers compared with control siRNA-transfected
YCC10 cells (P < .01) (Fig. 2A). Fluorescence-activated

928

cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed a significant decrease
in the number of cells in S-phase in among the YCC10 cells
with ZEB1 knockdown compared with the control cells (P
< .01) (Fig. 2B), confirming the inhibitory effect of ZEB1
knockdown on cell proliferation. Concomitant with this inhibition of cell proliferation, there was a significant increase
in the number of cells accumulating in G2/M-phase after
ZEB1 knockdown with YCC10 cells (P < .01) (Fig. 2B).
ZEB1 Deletion Enhanced the Effect of
GCV on Gastric Cancer Cells
Because the lytic (but not the latent) form of EBV infection converts the antivirus drug GCV into its active form,
we examined whether ZEB1 depletion could increase the
sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to GCV. After ZEB1
knockdown, as expected, GCV treatment demonstrated a
significantly greater additive effect on cell growth with
55% inhibition in cell viability (P < .001) compared with

YCC10 cells that were transfected with ZEB1-siRNA
alone (Fig. 2A). However, there was no difference in cell
viability among YCC10 cells that were treated with GCV
alone (Fig. 2A), indicating that depletion of ZEB1 rendered YCC10 cells much more sensitive to the cytotoxic
effects of GCV, and the enhanced cytotoxicity was lytic
status-dependent on ZEB1 knockdown.
Depletion of ZEB1 Induced Apoptosis in
YCC10 Cells
To determine whether the decrease in cell viability
observed was caused by an induction of apoptosis, the

cellular apoptotic rate was determined using annexinV/FITC/PI double staining. The number of early apoptotic cells at 72 hours after ZEB1-siRNA transfection
was increased substantially compared with control
siRNA-transfected cells (P < .05) (Fig. 3A). The induction of apoptosis was confirmed further by an analysis of
2 crucial apoptosis-related mediators—caspase 3 and
poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) (PARP)—by Western blot analysis. Enhanced expression of the active forms
of caspase 3 and PARP were demonstrated in YCC10 cells
treated with ZEB1-siRNA, as indicated in Figure 3B.
These results suggested that apoptosis concomitant with

G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by the down-regulation of
ZEB1 was a plausible cause leading to the growth inhibition in ZEB1-depleted gastric cancer cells.
Overexpression of ZEB1 Caused
Lytic-to-Latent Switch Through
Repressing Zp Activity in Lytic AGS-EBV
Gastric Cancer Cells
To confirm the effect of ZEB1 in the regulation of the
EBV latent-lytic switch, we tested whether the overexpression of ZEB1 could inhibit lytic reactivation. The lytic
EBV-infected AGS cells, which had no ZEB1 expression,
were transfected with a pCI-neo vector that expressed
ZEB1 or with an empty control vector. Ectopic overexpression of ZEB1 in AGS-EBV cells was confirmed by
RT-PCR analysis and Western blot analysis, respectively
(Fig. 4A). The overexpression of ZEB1 led to a significant
inhibition of EBV lytic gene (BZLF1) expression
(Fig. 4B) in AGS-EBV cells.
It was reported previously that transcription of the
BZLF1 gene can be initiated from its proximal promoter
Zp and that ZEB1 binds to Zp, repressing BZLF1 tran-

930

scription.13 Next, we examined the activity of Zp before
and after ZEB1 overexpression in AGS-EBV cells using a
luciferase reporter activity assay. Our results indicated
that the activity of Zp was inhibited significantly by ZEB1
re-expression (P < .001) (Fig. 4C), indicating that ZEB1
inhibited BZLF1 transcription by reducing activity of the
BZLF1 promoter Zp.
Ectopic Expression of ZEB1 Promoted the
Growth of Gastric Cancer Cells With Lytic
EBV Infection
We further evaluated the biologic influence of ectopic
ZEB1 in lytic AGS-EBV cells. Ectopic expression of ZEB1
in AGS-EBV cells caused a significant increase in the number of viable cells (P < .01) (Fig. 5A). The promoting
effect of ZEB1 on cell growth was confirmed further in a
colony-formation assay (Fig. 5B). The colonies that formed
in ZEB1-transfected cells were significantly greater in number and larger in size than those formed in empty vectortransfected cells (up to 100% of vector control; P < .001)
(Fig. 5B). Moreover, FACS analysis of ZEB1-transfected
AGS-EBV cells revealed a significant induction in the

cells (P < .01) (Fig. 5C). Thus, ZEB1 overexpression
induced cell proliferative capacity.
Suppression of Apoptosis by ZEB1
in AGS-EBV Cells
We examined the contribution of apoptosis to the observed
growth inhibition in AGS-EBV cells derived by ZEB1. The
overexpression of ZEB1 down-regulated protein expression
of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and cleaved PARP
compared with vector-transfected AGS-EBV cells, indicating
reduced cell apoptosis, as illustrated in Figure 5D.
Quantitative Analysis of EBV DNA Levels in
Gastric Cancer, Precancerous Lesions, and
Controls
The presence of EBV in 711 primary gastric cancer samples, 97 premalignant lesions, and 24 normal gastric tissue
samples was determined with 2 EBV DNA fragments
targeting the BamHI-W region and the EBNA1 region.
There was a strong, positive correlation between EBV
viral load data from the BamHI-W region and from the
EBNA1 region (correlation coefficient, 0.683; P <

.0001). ROC curve analysis based on EBV viral load levels
in gastric cancer samples and normal gastric tissue samples
yielded area under the curve values of 0.956 for BamHIW and 0.930 for EBNA1 (Fig. 6A), respectively. At a cutoff value of 106 copies per 105 cells, both BamHI-W and
EBNA1 had sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 97.1%.
EBV DNA was detected in 80 of 711 gastric cancer
samples (11.3%), in 4 of 97 precancerous lesions (4.1%),
but not in any of 24 healthy controls using both BamHIW PCR and EBNA1 PCR. The proportion of EBV
DNA-positive samples among these groups differed
significantly (chi-square statistic, 7.57; P < .05). EBV
DNA-positive results were significantly more frequent in
gastric cancer samples than in precancerous lesion samples
(chi-square statistic, 4.66; P < .05).
EBER assay, which is the gold standard for EBV
detection, also was applied to validate the results generated by Taqman PCR assays. Thirteen samples that had
measurable EBV DNA in 2 Taqman assays were selected
randomly for EBER assay in paraffin-embedded tissues.
The results indicated that all 13 samples had detectable
EBV by EBER assay (Fig. 6B) consistent with their EBV
status detected by PCR.

Clinicopathologic Features of EBV-Associated
Gastric Carcinoma
An analysis of the association between clinicopathologic features and EBV infection in human gastric cancers is presented
in Table 3. The presence of EBV was associated with age (P
< .05), a male predominance (P < .0001), and intestinal histologic type (P ¼ .05) and was marginally associated with
well or moderate differentiation of gastric cancer (P ¼ .08).
However, we observed no correlation between the presence
EBV and tumor location, Helicobacter pylori infection (Table
3), or survival in patients with gastric cancer (Fig. 6C).
ZEB1 Expression in Primary Gastric Cancer
Tissues
We evaluated ZEB1 expression in EBV-positive and
EBV-negative primary gastric cancer tissues by using
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 7). ZEB1 was detected
frequently in EBV-positive gastric cancers (80%; 12 of 15
samples) compared with EBV-negative gastric cancers
(10%; 5 of 50 samples; P < .0001).

DISCUSSION
The gastric cancer cell line YCC10 is a natural model of
gastric cancer cells with latent EBV infection. We

932

observed that ZEB1, a key repressor in silencing the
expression of the latent-lytic switch gene BZLF1 during
EBV latency, was highly expressed in this cell line. The
down-regulation of ZEB1 in YCC10 cells caused the upregulation of BZLF1 expression and the down-regulation
of latent gene EBNA1 expression (Fig. 1), thus promoting
the latent-lytic switch of EBV infection. BZLF1 reportedly regulates the switch from latent infection to virus
replication in EBV-infected cells and, thus, acts as a key
mediator of reactivation from latency to the viral productive infection of EBV14 through activating the promoter
of another EBV gene, BSLF2/BMLF1 (human herpesvirus
4).15 Expression of the BZLF1 gene is necessary and sufficient to disrupt EBV latency.16 Conversely, it also has
been reported that EBNA1 is expressed in all types of EBV
latent infections that are identified in proliferating cells
and tumors.17 EBNA1 is essential for the maintenance of
viral latent replication and persistence.18,19 Thus, loss of
ZEB1 may lead to reactivation into lytic replication
because of the enhanced expression of BZLF1 and the
reduced expression of EBNA1. To better define the effect
of ZEB1 on the latent-lytic switch in gastric cancer, we
examined its functional consequences by knocking it
down in the human gastric cancer cell line YCC10. In the

Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) to detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in gastric cancer (GC) tissues and normal

current work, decreased ZEB1 expression in YCC10 cells
led to the inhibition of cell growth and S-phase cells
(Fig. 2), induced apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest in
G2/M-phase (Fig. 3). The induction of apoptosis was
confirmed further by increased expression of the activated
forms of caspase 3 and PARP, which led to the impairment of DNA repair and apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Thus,

heightened ZEB1 depletion may diminish EBV-positive
gastric cancer cell growth by up-regulating apoptotic cell
death pathways. Collectively, knocking down ZEB1 by
itself was sufficient to induce EBV lytic replication in
latently infected gastric cancer cells.
We observed that GCV alone was barely effective in
controlling the YCC10 cells. This is consistent with

Figure 7. These are representative images of zinc finger E-box binding factor 1 (ZEB1) expression in primary gastric cancer (GC)
specimens determined by immunohistochemistry. ZEB1 was expressed in the nucleus of Epstein-Barr virus-positive gastric cancer
cells (brown color; original magnification, 400).

previously findings that EBV-positive tumor cells infected
with latent viral forms do not respond to GCV.20 However, the induction of lytic EBV infection in YCC10 cells
induced by the re-expression of an immediate-early gene
BZLF1 through knocking down ZEB1 allowed the cells to
be killed by GCV. This is because the host cells with lytic
(but not latent) EBV infection express virally encoded

934

kinases to phosphorylate the prodrug GCV into its cytotoxic form.20,21 Phosphorylated GCV is able to inhibit
DNA polymerase of the host cells, leading to the apoptosis of EBV-infected tumor cells.20,21 Because EBV-positive tumor cells are primarily in the latent form of EBV
infection, induction of the latent-to-lytic switch of the
EBV life cycle by ZEB1 inhibition can improve the

clinical efficacy of GCV specifically by killing EBV-positive tumor cells, representing a new option for the treatment of EBV-associated gastric cancer.
In addition to a loss-of-function study, we investigated the role of ZEB1 as a transcriptional repressor of
BZLF1 and, thus, as a regulator of the latent-to-lytic
switch of the EBV life cycle in gastric cancer through a
gain-of-function assay. Ectopic overexpression of ZEB1 in
AGS-EBV, a gastric cancer cell line that contains the lytic
form of EBV infection22 in the absence of ZEB1, led to
the down-regulation of BZFL1 (Fig. 4B). We also demonstrated showed that this suppressive effect of ZEB1 on
BZFL1 expression was mediated specifically by binding to
a specific site (Zp) of the BZLF1 promoter (Fig. 4C). This
was supported by recent reports that ZEB1 can directly
bind Zp through the ZV element, repressing the transcription of BZLF1 initiated from Zp and, thus, contributing
to regulation of the switch between latency and lytic replication of EBV.7,8,13,23 Two recent studies indicated the
role of the microRNA molecule miR200 in regulating the
EBV life-cycle switch and also observed that ZEB1
repressed Zp activity.24,25 In addition, ectopic expression
of ZEB1 in AGS-EBV cells had a marked promoting
effect on cell growth and proliferation (Fig. 5). Moreover,
ectopic expression of ZEB1 in AGS-EBV cells reduced the
expression of proapoptotic genes, including cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9, and PARP (Fig. 5D). The reduced cell
apoptosis in ZEB1-transfected AGS-EBV cells was caused
at least in part by the down-regulation of BZLF1, which
reportedly induced cell death in EBV-positive gastric cancer cells.6 Taken together, these results indicate that the
overexpression of ZEB1 is sufficient to inhibit lytic reactivation by inhibiting the transcription of BZLF1, further
confirming that ZEB1 indeed plays a central role in the
maintenance of EBV latency in gastric cancer cells.
The association between EBV infection and gastric
cancer has not been well documented in a Chinese population. We evaluated whether EBV-positive gastric cancers
display distinct clinicopathologic features and indicate a
different prognosis relevant to EBV-negative gastric cancers in a large (711 patients), well documented patient
population. The presence of EBV in gastric cancer tissues
was determined by 2 real-time, quantitative PCR analyses
that targeted different parts of the EBV genome (BamHIW and EBNA1)12 and was validated by an EBER assay. In
our cohort, 80 of 711 patients (11.3%) had EBV-positive
gastric cancer. This is similar to the prevalence of EBV
reported in patients with gastric cancer in other countries.26 EBV-positive tumors were observed more often in

Cancer

February 15, 2012

men (P < .001) and in younger patients (P < .05) (Table
2). Trends toward the predominance of men and of
younger patients have been observed previously in Japanese27 and Dutch28 patients with gastric cancer. Histologically, a greater prevalence of intestinal type tumors was
observed in EBV-positive patients. This is consistent with
the data published by van Beek et al.28 The development
of the intestinal type malignancy is a longer multistep
process through gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia,
dysplasia, and (ultimately) intestinal type carcinoma,
which is different from the diffuse type of gastric cancer in
terms of age, sex, and the process of carcinogenesis, in
which no precursor lesions have been identified to date.
The finding that EBV infection was detected in precancerous lesions (atrophy and intestinal metaplasia), although
the frequency of EBV infection was distinctly lower in
precancerous lesions than in tumors (P < .05), but not in
normal gastric tissues, indicated that EBV enters the
gastric epithelium at an early stage during the multistep
process of gastric carcinogenesis. This is in line with the
observations of others who observed EBV in precursor
lesions and also in carcinoma cells.29 Thus, it is likely that
EBV infects a dysplastic gastric epithelial cell, transforming it into a carcinoma cell as an additional mechanism
contributing to gastric malignant progression. Because
ZEB1 was detected more frequently in EBV-positive
gastric cancers than in EBV-negative gastric cancers
(P < .0001), the current results indicate that ZEB1 is
essential for the maintenance of latent EBV replication
and persistence in gastric cancer.
No difference was observed in the tumor location in
our cohort, although it has been reported that EBV-associated gastric tumors demonstrate a preferential location
in the proximal part of the stomach.28 In addition, the
overall survival of our EBV-positive patients with gastric
cancer did not differ from the survival of patients who
had EBV-negative tumors (Fig. 6C). However, a better
survival had been described in EBV-associated gastric cancers compared with EBV-negative cancers in the Netherlands, where there is a low incidence of gastric cancer.28
The discrepancies in tumor location and prognosis for
patients with EBV-positive cancer observed by us and by
others most likely are the result of investigating different
populations. Collectively, our results suggest that EBV
plays a distinct role in gastric carcinogenesis in Chinese
patients.
In conclusion, our findings suggested that ZEB1 is a
key repressor in the maintenance of EBV latency in gastric
cancer cells through silencing BZLF1. EBV-carrying

primary gastric cancer is a distinct subtype with different
