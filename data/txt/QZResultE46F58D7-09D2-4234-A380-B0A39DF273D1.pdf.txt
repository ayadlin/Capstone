ABSTRACT
miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs are transcribed from a polycistronic transcription
unit C13orf25 that generates six mature miRNAs, miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR19b, miR-20a and miR-92a that are overexpressed in lung and colon cancers. Here we
show that the expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs are reduced in cancerous prostate
tissues compared to uninvolved areas and also in aggressive prostate cancer cells.
Restoration of expression of all members of miR-17-92a cluster showed, decreased
expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1 and SSH1; and LIMK1 and
FGD4 of RhoGTPase signaling pathway. Expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs caused
decreased cell proliferation, reduced activation of AKT and MAP kinases, delayed
tumorigenicity and reduced tumor growth in animals. Expression of miR-17-92a
miRNAs inhibited EMT via reduced cell migration and expression of mesenchymal
markers while elevating expression and surface localization of the epithelial marker
E-Cadherin. Expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs improved sensitivity of androgen
dependent LNCaP 104-S prostate cancer cells to anti-androgen drug Casodex, AKT
inhibitor MK-2206 2HCl, and docetaxel. The androgen refractory PC-3 cells also
showed increased sensitivity to docetaxel, MK-2206 2HCl and Aurora kinase inhibitor
VX680 upon ectopic expression of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs. Our data demonstrate
a tumor suppressor effect of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs in prostate cancer cells
and restoration of expression of these miRNAs has a therapeutic benefit for both
androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells.

miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs are transcribed
from the polycistronic miR-17-92a gene located in the
third intron of a primary transcript C13orf25 [9] that is
processed into six mature miRNAs viz. miR-17, miR18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a [10].
miR-17-92a cluster has been differentially expressed in
various cancers [11–13] and based on the function of the
target genes, has been designated as oncogenic miRNAs
[14, 15]. In neuroblastoma cells, the miR-17-92a cluster
has been shown to impair TGF-β signaling pathway
through miR-17 and -20a targeting of SMAD2, SMAD4
and transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2)
[16]. Expression of miR-17-92a cluster facilitates cell
growth by reducing hypoxia inducible factor 1 α (HIF1α) activity in lung cancer cells [17] and promotes cell
survival through miR-19 mediated targeting of PTEN [18].
However, published reports also show anti-proliferative

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are recognized as a group of
small noncoding RNAs that play diverse roles in regulation
of biological processes and have a unique expression
profile that varies in a tissue and disease specific manner
[1, 2]. Expression of miRNAs is often deregulated in early
stage cancers, which facilitates development of aggressive
and drug resistant disease [3, 4]. MicroRNAs are often
designated as oncogenic miRNAs or tumor suppressor
miRNAs based on the expression patterns and functions
[5, 6]. However, emerging evidence indicates that miRNA
expression and functions are in most cases context
specific and are influenced by other regulatory agents [7];
therefore, it is not unusual to encounter tumor suppressor
effects of miRNAs that show oncogenic functions in other
specific cancers [8].

and senescence promoting effects of the members of the
miR-17-92a clusters through direct targeting of Dicer
by miR-18a in bladder cancer cells [19]; through downregulation of the Amplified In Breast cancer 1 (AIB)
mRNAs by miR-17-5p [20]; and through destabilization
of proto-oncogene Leukemia Related Factor (LRF) mRNA
by miR-20a [21]. These effects further emphasize the
contextual aspects of the functional complexities of miR17-92a cluster. Loss of expression of miR-17-3p has been
noted in prostate cancer [22] and a functional relationship
between the members of miR-17-92a cluster and androgen
receptor function has been speculated [10, 23]. However,
in depth understanding of the function of the miR-1792a cluster miRNAs in prostate cancer growth and drug
resistance is lacking.
Prostate cancer affects a significant number of
men in developed countries where it is typically the
second leading cause of cancer related deaths [24].
Although initially slow growing, prostate cancer can
advance rapidly, leading to development of metastatic
cancers [25, 26]. Surgical therapy is commonly used
for localized disease but androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT)/anti-androgen treatment is the front line therapy
upon relapse [27, 28]. Nonetheless, development of
ADT/anti-androgen resistance is not uncommon, which
leads to generation of castration resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) [29, 30]. Several miRNAs are known to be
involved in progression of localized prostate cancer to
metastasis including miRs-let7c, -143, -145 and -218 [31,
32]. Mavridis et al showed loss of miR-224 expression
in advanced prostate cancer and that sustained miR224 expression is associated with favorable prognosis
[33]. Loss of expression of miRs-205, -34b/c and -302a,
which target Bcl2 and AKT, has been documented
in high-grade prostate cancers [34–37], whereas, upregulation of miRNAs including miRs-183, -153, and
-125b, which target SMAD4, PTEN, p53, Puma and
Bak1 has been noted in aggressive prostate cancers
[38–40]. Nonetheless, most of the functional studies
are on individual miRNAs, which may not represent the
true environmental milieu of gene regulation, because
miRNAs often function as part of a regulatory network.
Earlier, we showed loss of expressions of the
members of miR-17-92a cluster as prostate cancer
cells progressed to antiandrogen resistance [41]. In this
study, we investigated the expression of miR-17-92a
cluster in prostate tissues, its role in destabilization of
mRNA targets such as cyclin D1, FGD4, LIMK1 and
Slingshot phosphatase (SSH1) and its potential effects
on activation of signaling cascades, tumor growth and
drug sensitivity using cell culture, and xenograft models.
These data demonstrate anti-oncogenic and drugsensitivity promoting functions of miR-17-92a cluster
miRNAs when ectopically expressed in prostate cancer
cells.

Loss of expression of miR-17-92a cluster in
prostate tumor tissues and cells
Our studies on genome-wide profiling of miRNAs
using LNCaP cell culture model showed down-regulation
of miR-17-92a cluster in anti-androgen resistant cells
[41]. In this study, validation of expression profiles in
clinical specimens also showed loss of expression of
this cluster miRNAs. We used macro-dissected prostate
tumor tissues and corresponding uninvolved areas to
monitor expression of mature miR-17, -18a, -20a, -19a,
-19b and -92a miRNAs. Patients were selected based on
specific criteria including no prior treatments, Gleason
Scores, pre-surgical PSA and local invasion; and based
on CAPRA-S score [42] stratified into low, medium and
high risk of biochemical recurrence (Table 1). Normalized
fold-change (FC) expression analysis showed a distinct
down-regulation/loss of expression of all members of the
miRNA cluster in 58-73% of the cases tested (Figure 1A
and Supplementary Table S1). Comparative analysis of the
expression data revealed that: A) the average expression
of all miRNAs was reduced in the majority of the cases
with Gleason Scores between 6-9 including two cases
with Gleason Scores of 9, and B) an increasing percentage
of cases from low to high risks groups showed reduced
expression of miR-92a (37% of low risk, 75% of medium
risk and 83% of high risk) (solid triangle Figure 1A).
Correlative analyses of the miRNA expression with at
least a 1.5-fold change in expression and risk assessment
showed an average down-regulation of the cluster in
35% of low risk cases (CAPRA-S≤2) and an average upregulation in 19% of the cases. For patients with a higher
risk (CAPRA-S≥3), the percentage of patients with downregulated miR-17-92a miRNAs showed no change at 34%
(Figure 1B); however, a distinct reduction in the average
percentage of patients with up-regulation at only 9% for
these miRNAs could be noted. Additionally, no patients
with CAPRA-S ≥3 displayed increased expression of miR19b or miR-92a (Figure 1B). Further correlation analysis
of expression and CAPRA-S risk scores showed that four,
five or all miRNAs were down-regulated in 67% of the
cases in the high-risk and medium-risk groups (Table 2).
Reduced expression of three, two or one miRNAs was
noted in the rest of the 33% cases in the high or mediumrisk groups. In the low risk group, four, five or all miRNAs
were down-regulated in 50% of the cases while loss of
one, two or three miRNAs were noted in the other 50%
of the cases. Analysis of endogenous expression of these
miRNAs in prostate adenocarcinoma and BPH-1 cell lines
also showed reduced expression of most of the miRNAs
in cancer cells compared to BPH-1 cells (Figure  1C).
This observation led to the subsequent experiments to
understand the functional significance of the loss of

in prostate cancer cells.

to that was detected in BPH-1 cells. We intended to
express all miRNAs in the cluster simultaneously instead
of single miRNAs to mimic the physiological condition
and study the combinatorial effects. Overexpression
of all miRNAs changed the morphology of PC-3 cells
from spindle shapes to a more adherent cobblestone
type (Figure 2A). Expression of these miRNAs resulted
in 25%-40% reduction in concentration of some of the
computer algorithm based predicted target proteins FGD4,
LIMK1, SSH1 and cyclin D1, which contain one or more
binding site(s) of miR-17 and -20a but none of the other
miRNAs of the cluster, at the 3’-UTR (Figure 2B). PC-3
cells were used to confirm the direct binding of miR-17
and -20a to the predicted sites of one of the targets, FGD4.

Expression of miR-17-92a cluster altered

We generated sublines of PC-3 prostate cancer cells
that overexpress all mature miRNAs of the miR-17-92a
cluster compared to the control cells expressing scrambled
(Scr) RNA upon transfection with the precursor miRNAs
(Supplementary Figure S1A). The extent of expression
was increased between 1.3-2.5-fold, a level comparable

Expression of miR-17-92a cluster inhibited
activation of MAP kinase and AKT pathways
and reduced cell proliferation

Luciferase reporter assays were done upon transient cotransfection of the miR-17-92a precursor construct plus
a luciferase construct containing a fragment (bases from
position 80-90) of FGD4 3’-UTR, in PC-3 cells. Results
showed 54% inhibition of translation of FGD4 mRNA,
which could be rescued by mutating miR-17 and -20a
binding sites at the 3’-UTR (Figure 2E). Additionally, we
validated destabilization of the 3’-UTRs of LIMK1 and
SSH1 using luciferase reporter assays upon co-transfection
of LIMK1 and SSH1 luciferase constructs along with
miR-17-92a expression vectors, (Supplementary Figure
S2), which showed 47% and 26% reduction in luciferase
activities, respectively. Binding of miR-17 and -20a at
the 3-UTR of cyclin D1 has already been experimentally
validated [43]. Taken together, these results confirmed
that overexpression of miR-17-92a reduced synthesis of
proteins involved in activation of RhoGTPase pathway
(FGD4) [44], actin cytoskeleton reorganization (LIMK1)
[45, 46] and cell cycle regulation (SSH1, cyclin D1) that
are often hyper-activated or over-expressed in advanced
prostate cancer [47–49].

Our results showing inhibition of expression of
cyclin D1 prompted us to study cell proliferation and
activation of the signaling pathways that promote cell
proliferation. Using western blots, we detected expression
of phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated AKT and
phosphorylated AKT substrate, PRAS40, as markers for
activation of MAP Kinase and AKT pathways in whole
cell lysates of PC-3 cells expressing miR-17-92a cluster
miRNAs. Our analyses showed a significant reduction
(40%-55%) of these proteins in cells expressing miR-1792a miRNAs compared to control cells expressing Scr
RNAs (Figure 3A and 3B and Supplementary Figure S3).
Although a slight reduction (20%) in total AKT was noted
the reduction in phosphorylated AKT was much higher in
miR-17-92a miRNA cluster expressing cells. No changes
in the expression of total ERK and PRAS40 were noted in
these cells (Supplementary Figure S3). A reduced expression

as detected by immunofluorescence analysis, confirmed
the western blot data (Figure 3C). The percentage of cells

was also reduced significantly in transiently transfected
PC-3 cells upon expression of miR-17-92a (63% vs.
83%) compared to Scr RNA expression as detected by
immunofluorescence (Figure 3C). Comparative MTS assays
showed a significantly reduced (20%-30%) growth of
transiently transfected LNCaP 104-S and PC-3 cells upon

or Scr RNAs were used for experiments on tumor growth
in xenograft models. Cells were injected into the flanks of
humanized NSG mice and tumor growth monitored for 55
days. The results showed a significant reduction in tumor
volume (35%-53%) in mice injected with PC-3 and M12
cells expressing miR-17-92a cluster compared to the tumors
in mice injected with cells expressing Scr RNAs (Figure
4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E and 4F and Supplementary Figure S4).
A delayed tumorigenesis was also noted in mice injected
with prostate cancer cells expressing miR-17-92a cluster
(Figure 4A). Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis of expression
of the mature miRNAs in tumor tissues showed a sustained
maintenance of the increased (>2.0 to >7.0 fold) expression
of all cluster miRNAs (Figure 4G and 4H). In general,
animals with both PC-3 and M12 miR-17-92 tumors
survived longer than animals with tumors expressing Scr
RNAs. Some of the M12 miR-17-92a tumor bearing animals
were alive till 80 days post injection and showed sluggish or
stunted tumor growth (data not shown).

Expression of miR-17-92a inhibited cell
migration and EMT

(Figure 5E and 5F). Our results demonstrate a phenotypic
conversion of the highly aggressive PC-3 cells to a more
adherent type of cells with a reduced migration rate.

Previously, we noted a change in cell morphology
upon restored expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs.
To understand the contribution of miR-17-92a cluster
expression to changes in cell behavior and phenotypes,
we tested cell migration and expression of EMT markers
such as, vimentin [51], Twist1 [52], Slug [53], TCF8/
ZEB1 [54] and N-Cadherin [55] in PC-3 stable sublines
expressing miR-17-92a miRNAs. The bright field images
and quantification of the distance traversed by the cells
in scratch assays after 14 and 24h of incubation showed
a significantly slower rate (25%-27%) of migration
upon expression of miR-17-92a compared to the control
cells expressing Scr RNAs (Figure 5A and 5B). This
observation was supported by the immunoblot assay
results showing significantly reduced expressions of
N-Cadherin, vimentin, Twist1, Slug, and TCF8/ZEB1
in these cells compared to the control cells (Figure 5C
and 5D). Conversely, increased expression (3.2-fold)
and surface localization (22%) of the epithelial maker
E-Cadherin [56] was noted in PC-3 cells upon expression
of miR-17-92a miRNAs as determined by western
blots (Figure 5C and 5D) and flow cytometric analysis

Expression of miR-17-92a cluster improved drug
sensitivity of androgen-dependent and castration
resistant prostate cancer cells
Our previous studies showed down-regulation of
miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs in LNCaP 104-S cells as
they developed resistance to Casodex (CDX) [41]. Here
we examined the involvement of miR-17-92a cluster in
acquisition of CDX resistance of LNCaP 104-S cells. We
used androgen-dependent LNCaP 104-S cells transiently
transfected with pre miR-17-92a cluster DNA, and
treated with CDX singly and in combination with the
AKT inhibitor (AKTi) (MK-2206 2HCl), or docetaxel
(DTX). As noted earlier, expression of miR-17-92a cluster
miRNAs reduced the number of viable cells upon vehicle
treatment compared to the Scr RNA expressing cells
(Figure 6A). Viability assays after single and combination
treatments showed a synergistic effect of the expression
of miR-17-92a cluster and CDX treatment on the overall
reduction of the number of viable cells when compared to
Scr RNA expression (Figure 6A). Treatment with DHT

(10nM) showed an increased number of metabolically
active cells expressing Scr RNAs whereas expression of
miR-17-92a miRNAs made these cells less responsive to
DHT (Figure 6A). LNCaP 104-S cells expressing miR-1792a miRNAs also showed an increased sensitivity to DTX
at 1 nM and 5 nM concentrations compared to Scr control
cells. Combination treatments with CDX and DTX at a
lower (1 nM) concentration showed a significantly higher
sensitivity than monotherapy (Figure 6A). Treatments
with AKTi at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5μM concentrations reduced
cell viability significantly for both cell lines but to a much
greater extent for cells expressing miR-17-92a (Figure
6B) compared to control cells expressing Scr RNAs.

Combination treatments with CDX (10μM) showed
a slightly higher reduction in mean percentage of cell
viability. These results suggest a synergistic effect of both
drugs (Figure 6B).
Next we examined the effect of miR-17-92a cluster
on drug sensitivity of androgen-independent prostate
cancer cells. Treatment of transiently transfected PC-3
cells expressing miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs or Scr
RNAs with DTX and VX680 (Aurora kinase inhibitor) in
combination showed a significant reduction in cell viability
compared to control cells expressing Scr RNAs, but not
when treated singly, except at a higher concentration
(25nM) of DTX (Figure 6D). We tested a pan inhibitor

of Aurora kinases as Aurora kinase inhibition, which
causes mitotic arrest and apoptosis, has been recognized
as an effective anticancer therapeutic strategy [57, 58].
Treatments with AKTi and DTX also showed an increased
mean reduction in viability of PC-3 cells upon expression
of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs compared to control
cells (Figure 6C) but not when treated singly suggesting
a possible potentiating effect of miR-17-92a on the
effectiveness of AKTi and CDX combination treatment.
These observations indicate that restored expression of

miR-17-92a cluster has a potential therapeutic benefit for
treatment of both androgen-dependent and CRPC cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated the functional
significance of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs in prostate
cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents. Because miRNAs are integrated into positive
and negative regulatory loops of gene expression, it is

important to study the expression and functions of all
members of miR -17-92a cluster miRNAs concurrently
to better mimic the in vivo environmental milieu. Our
expression analyses provide evidence of an association of
reduced expression of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs with
higher potential of biochemical failure, as indicated by
higher CAPRA-S scores, of the majority of prostate cancer
patients tested. To our knowledge, this is the first report
on the expression of the miR-17-92a cluster in annotated
prostate cancer clinical specimens.
Previously we showed loss of expression of all
members of miR-17-92a cluster as prostate cancer
cells developed resistance to ADT and antiandrogen
CDX [41]. This observation opposes published studies
showing increased expression of miR-17-92a cluster
miRNAs in lung cancers and in B-cell lymphomas [13,
59]. The change in expression may either be driven by
occasional amplification of the 13q31.3 locus and/or
hyperactivation of Myc oncogene in these tumors, which
is a potent transcriptional activator of MIR17HG gene
[60]; alternatively, it may be due to increased stabilization
of the mature miRNAs by endogenous regulatory RNAs
or proteins. Here we noted a similar loss of expression
of miR-17-92a in prostate tumors and in prostate cancer
cells, which further confirms down-regulation of miR17-92a cluster in prostate cancer. In support of our
finding, reduced expressions of miR-17-5p and miR17-3p in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues have been
documented earlier [22, 23].
Our results revealed down-regulation of FGD4 and
LIMK1 of Rho-GTPase signaling pathway; and cyclin
D1 and SSH1 cell cycle regulatory proteins upon restored
expression of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs. A role of
FGD4 in promotion of cancer cell migration has been
reported earlier [44]. We also noted FGD4 overexpression
in prostate tumors with higher Gleason scores and in
androgen-independent tumors (unpublished observation).
This observation suggests that expression miR-17-92a
cluster facilitates establishing an anti-oncogenic and
anti-migratory environment in prostate cancer cells by
down-regulating FGD4, LIMK1, cyclin D1 and SSH1,
as overexpression and oncogenic/metastatic functions
of these proteins are documented in prostate and other
cancers [44, 61–63]. The tumor suppressor function of
miR-17-92a cluster in prostate cancer cells is supported
by our results showing reduced cell proliferation and
reduced phosphorylation/activation of ERK1/2 kinases
and AKT in these cells. In vivo experiments also showed
anti-tumorigenic and tumor growth inhibitory effects of
miR-17-92a cluster, when expressed in highly aggressive
PC-3 and M12 prostate cancer cells, which strengthen
the inference that the miR-17-92a cluster exhibits tumor
suppressor effects. Our study also demonstrates an
anti-migratory function of miR-17-92a cluster that is
substantiated by an increased expression of E-Cadherin
and reduced expression of other mesenchymal markers.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Migration inhibitory effects of miR-17-3p expression
have been reported earlier in prostate cancer cells, which
showed reduced vimentin expression upon of miR-17-3p
overexpression [22].
Our study further establish miR-17-92a cluster as a
potential therapeutic target, showing improved sensitivity
of LNCaP 104-S and PC-3 cells to some of the drugs that
are currently being used for the treatment of CRPC such
as anti-microtubule (DTX), AKTi, anti-androgen (CDX)
(androgen-dependent cells) and anti-Aurora kinases
(androgen-independent cells). It can be speculated that the
enhanced sensitivity of the miR-17-92a cluster expressing
LNCaP 104-S cells to CDX is mediated through
interfering androgen receptor function, as miR-17-5p has
been shown to inhibit androgen receptor transcriptional
activity through targeting p300/CBP [23]. The improved
sensitivity of PC-3 cells expressing miR-17-92a cluster to
DTX and VX680 in combination is presumably mediated
through the inhibition of LIMK1 expression and activity
(Figure 2 and Figure 3). Published studies showed that
LIMK1 destabilizes microtubules [64] and interferes with
DTX induced microtubule stability and active LIMK1 is
needed for Aurora kinase A functional activation [65].
The enhanced sensitivity of both miRNA expressing
cell types to AKTi singly and in combination with CDX
(LNCaP 104-S) or DTX (PC-3) is possibly through
miR-17-92a expression associated inhibition of AKT
activation (Figure 3). However, this assumption does not
rule out the possibility of alteration of other key signaling
pathways and in-depth studies are required to understand
the mechanistic aspects of miR-17-92a induced increased
drug sensitivity.
Anti-proliferative, adhesive and anti-migratory
properties of miR-17 upon overexpression in non-tumor
cells and overall growth retardation and smaller organs
in transgenic mice has been reported earlier [66] but
our results show the maintenance of similar distinctive
functions of the expressed miR-17 in the presence of
expression of the other miRNAs of the cluster in prostate
cancer cells. It is possible that because both miR-17 and
-20a, which share the exact seed sequence but slightly
different central region, are maximally expressed in the
transfected cells and in tumors these two miRNAs may
functionally synergize. It is clear that altered expression of
specific targets decides the fate of a cell and the functional
designation of a miRNA. Because of the intricacies
of the complex regulatory network, and fine-tuning of
gene expression by miRNAs and competing endogenous
regulatory RNAs (ceRNAs), caution should be exercised
to understand the function of miRNAs within the cellular
context.
Taken together, our results strongly support the
designation of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs as tumor
suppressors for prostate cancer and that replenishment
of expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs as a cluster could
be used for combination therapy with other frontline

chemotherapeutic agents for treating advanced prostate
cancers. Nonetheless, the reason for the loss of expression
of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs in prostate tumor is not
clear, which could be a result of transcription silencing
through promoter hypermethylation or enhanced
destabilization of mature miRNAs. This assumption is
further attributable to the fact that c-MYC expression
does not corroborate with the variable expression of miR17-92a in BPH-1, LNCaP 104-S and PC-3 cells. c-MYC
expression was noted to be similar in BPH-1 and LNCaP
104-S cells but higher in PC-3 cells (Supplementary
Figure S5). This discrepancy indicates a possible
uncoupling of the mechanisms of down regulation of
miR-17-92a miRNA cluster and expression of c-MYC
in prostate cancer cells. In depth studies are required to
understand the mechanistic roles of miR-17-92a cluster in
modulation of particular pathways that lead to inhibition
of cell proliferation and increased drug sensitivity.

passive reference dye, ROX [41]. Ct values generated by
the SDS2.3 software were normalized according to the
average Ct values of the three internal controls (System
Biosciences) using qbasePLUS software (Biogazelle). The
Ct values of all miRNAs were normalized to these controls
and the relative expression values were then generated
using qbasePLUS software. The Ct values were used to
derive ΔΔCt values using the miRNome analysis software
(System Biosciences).

Cell lines and transfection
PC-3 prostate cancer cells obtained from ATCC
were cultured in F12 HAM containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen).
M12 prostate cancer cells (a gift from Jay Ware) [67]
were cultured in RPMI containing 5% fetal bovine
serum, 10ng/mL EGF, ITS mix (5μg/mL insulin, 5μg/mL
transferrin, 5ng/ml selenium), 50μg/mL gentamycin, and
0.1μM dexamethasone. The androgen responsive LNCaP
104-S cells were a generous gift from Dr. Shutsung Liao
(University of Chicago). This androgen dependent LNCaP
subline was isolated from the parental LNCaP cells and
characterized as previously described [68]. LNCaP 104S cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, 1nM DHT (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1%
antibiotic/antimycotic. For ectopic expression of premiRNAs of miR-17-92 cluster, PC-3, M12 and LNCaP
104-S cells were transfected with a modified expression
vector containing a precursor clone of miR-17-92
cluster PMIRH 17-92PA-1 (System Biosciences) using
Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, ThermoFisher).
The vector was engineered for replacing the DNA for GFP
between Not1 and Sal1 sites with a cassette containing
Neomycinr gene driven by SV40 promoter (pCMV6AC-GFP, Origene,) Stable clones of PC-3 and M12 cells
expressing miR-17-92 cluster pre-miRNAs were selected
using G418 and used for subsequent experiments. PC-3
and M12 cells expressing scrambled RNA were also
generated as the control cell lines. Stable sublines
were used for xenograft model experiments and other
specific experiments. LNCaP 104-S and PC-3 cells were
transiently transfected with the vector containing DNAs
for miR-17-92a precursor RNAs or the scrambled RNA
and used for specific experiments for drug sensitivity
assays using MTS based CellTiter Aqueous One Solution
cell proliferation assay kit (Promega). Transfected cells
were treated with various dilutions of inhibitors singly
or in combination and incubated for 48-72 hrs before
monitoring cell proliferation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Acquisition of patient tissues
Prostate tissues obtained by radical prostatectomies
were procured in the Cooperative Human Tissue Network
(Southern division) at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) in accordance with an approved
IRB protocol. Patients were selected based on the low,
medium and high risk of biochemical failure as predicted
from the pathological report and the medical record to
determine the risk factor based on the CAPRA-S score
[42]. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded prostate tissues
were macrodissected separately for tumor areas and for
matching uninvolved areas and used for RNA extraction
followed by qRT-PCR of the miR-17-92 miRNAs.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA from prostate tissues or cell lines was
extracted using RecoverAll (ThermoFisher) or Cells-toCts kit (System Biosciences). Total RNA was converted
to cDNA utilizing the QuantiMir RT Kit (System
Biosciences) in which small RNAs were tagged with
poly-A tail first followed by conversion to cDNAs using
oligo-dT primers. Expression of matured miRNAs was
determined by quantitative real-time PCR using specific
primers (System Biosciences) (Supplementary Figure
S6) for all members of the miR-17-92a cluster and 3
internal control snRNAs, and SYBR green PCR reagents
(ThermoFisher). MicroRNA IDs listed in the text are based
on Sanger miRBase identifiers. Primers were designed to
maintain uniform amplification efficiencies. Quantitative
RT-PCR was conducted using the Applied Biosystems
7900HT thermal cycler and data analyzed using SDS2.3
software. DNA concentrations were assessed through
SYBR Green fluorescence and normalized to that of the

protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of Central Florida.

Wound healing assay
PC-3 cells grown in HAM-F12K containing 5%
FBS, were grown to confluency (24-36hrs after seeding)
and wounds were created using a micro pipet tip. The
cells were rinsed twice with media and incubated in
media containing 5% FBS at 37°C. Wound healing within
the scratch was observed at 0, 14 and 24 hrs. Images of
the scratch were taken under 10x magnification using a
Nikon eclipse TE200 inverted microscope paired with
Nikon elements F 2.20 software. The average width of
each scratch was determined using ImageJ software. The
relative rate of migration was determined through the
initial analysis of the remaining width of the scratch at
different times and subtracting that from the scratch width
at 0hr. Next, the ratio of the distance traversed by the
individual cell lines was determined.

Dual label immunofluorescence
PC-3 cells stably expressing miR-17-92a miRNAs
or scrambled RNA were seeded on poly-l-lysine coated
coverslips. The next day, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, probed with antibodies specific
for pERK1/2 or Ki-67 (cell signaling). Cells were then
stained with goat anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488 and goat
anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 561 secondary antibodies. Cells
were visualized with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope and
images were analyzed using Leica LAS AF software suite.

Luciferase reporter assays
A 3’UTR-luciferase reporter vector containing
the first 206 bases of the FGD4 3’UTR (HmiT002135MT01) along with the control vector (CmiT000001MT06) were obtained from GeneCopoeia. The mutant
FGD4 3’UTR was generated by amplifying the
HmiT002135-MT01 vector with the following primer
sequences: Forward Primer 5’-GCTCTTCTTACA
CATCTGCTAGCCAGTTATGTTGAAAAATATAGG-3’,
Reverse Primer 5’-CCTATATTTTTCAACATAACTGGC
TAGCA GATGTGTAAGAAGAGC-3’. The luciferase
reporter constructs containing the WT-FGD4 3’UTR,
Mut-FGD4 3’UTR, or a control 3’UTR were transiently
transfected into PC-3 cells using X-tremeGENE HP
(Roche). Luciferase activity was monitored 48hrs post
transfection using the Luc-Pair Duo luciferase assay kit
from GeneCopoeia. The firefly luciferase activity was
normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity for each well.

Xenograft experiments were conducted in 6-8 weeks
old male NSG (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (005557))
mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory, and maintained
and treated under specific pathogen-free conditions.
Stable pool of PC-3 and M12 Cells (2 × 106/mouse)
suspended in 0.1% matrigel in 100μl volume were injected
subcutaneously into the flank and tumor growth monitored
for 55 days. Tumor growth was assessed by measurements
with a caliper and volume was calculated as 0.52 × length
× width × 2 as tumor grew. Tumors were harvested after
the specified time, tissue architecture examined by H&E
staining of formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections
and used for RNA extraction for qRTPCR of the matured
miR-17-92a miRNAs expressed in the tumor. Xenograft
experiments were performed according to an animal

PC-3 cells expressing miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs
or scrambled RNA were seeded and allowed to grow to
80% confluency in complete growth medium. Cells were
dissociated using 10mM EDTA in PBS, washed with PBS
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were
blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum, followed
by incubation with E-Cadherin antibodies on ice for 1
hour. The cells were then washed in PBS, followed by
incubation with AlexaFluor488 goat anti-rabbit antibodies
(Life Technologies). Labeled cells were washed again in
PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. The labeled cells were
detected using the BD Accuri flow cytometer and analyzed
with the BD CSampler software. Threshold of positive
staining was set above the intensity of cells incubated with
control antibodies.
