BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy has been the traditional treatment of choice for early stage esophageal
cancer. However, esophagectomy is associated with high mortality and morbidity in the elderly, and these
patients often receive chemoradiation instead. The authors of this report compared outcomes of esophagectomy versus chemoradiation in a population-based sample of elderly patients with early stage esophageal cancer. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database was used to
identify patients aged 65 years who were diagnosed with stage I or II esophageal cancer from 1991 to
2002. The associations of treatment with esophagectomy or chemoradiation were assessed along with demographic and clinical variables. A survival analyses was performed to compare outcomes with treatment
modality and was adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty patients with stage I
or II esophageal cancer were identified who underwent esophagectomy (n ¼ 341; 46.7%) or chemoradiation
(n ¼ 389; 53.3%). Older age, squamous cell histology, and lower socioeconomic status were associated
with increased odds of receiving chemoradiation. In multivariate analyses, chemoradiation was associated
with worse disease-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64-2.64) and
overall survival (HR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.58-2.34). The receipt of chemoradiation was associated with worse survival for patients with adenocarcinoma (HR, 3.01; 95%CI, 2.24-4.04), but there was no significant difference
for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 1.33; 95%CI, 0.98-1.80). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with
chemoradiation, esophagectomy may be associated with improved survival for early stage esophageal cancer in the elderly. The current results suggest that there also may be a subset of patients with squamous
cell carcinoma for whom chemoradiation is adequate therapy. A randomized trial would be useful to determine the optimal treatment for elderly patients with early stage esophageal cancer. Cancer 2009;115:4924–

Treating Elderly With Esophageal Cancer/Abrams et al

Unfortunately, esophagectomy is associated with a 5%
surgical mortality rate even at high-volume centers and a
10% mortality rate overall in the United States.2,3 The average age at diagnosis of esophageal cancer is 69 years, and
older age is a risk factor for worse surgical outcomes with
esophagectomy.3,4
Clinical trials from the 1990s demonstrated that
combined chemoradiation (CRT) was superior to radiation therapy alone.5,6 More recent studies have evaluated
the utility of neoadjuvant CRT followed by esophagectomy, although the results for this combination have been
mixed.7-10 Two randomized clinical trials suggested that,
in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, the survival
achieved with CRT alone may be equivalent to that
achieved with CRT followed by surgery.11,12 The current
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidelines recommend esophagectomy alone for stage I
disease (or endoscopic resection for intramucosal carcinoma) and optional neoadjuvant therapy for stage II disease.13 However, given the high operative mortality
associated with esophagectomy, many elderly patients are
referred for nonoperative treatment of esophageal cancer,
ie, definitive CRT alone.14 To our knowledge, there are
no published randomized trials to date that compare CRT
versus surgery alone for the treatment of esophageal cancer.
In most of the clinical trials for esophageal cancer
from the 1990s, the majority of patients had squamous cell
carcinoma. In Western countries, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is rising rapidly and is now the predominant cell type.15 There is very little published on
nonoperative management strategies specifically for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given the changing epidemiology
of esophageal cancer, the high operative mortality of esophagectomy, and recent data suggesting the efficacy of CRT
alone for squamous cell carcinoma, we decided to perform
a population-based study that compared esophagectomy to
CRT for patients with early stage esophageal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
We analyzed patient data from the linked Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database.16 The SEER database contains records of patients
who are diagnosed with cancer in regions that represent
Cancer

approximately 26% of the US population. SEER provides
information on tumor histology, location, stage of disease,
treatment, and survival along with selected census tractlevel demographic information. The Medicare database
includes Medicare Part A and Part B eligibility status,
dates of enrollment into health maintenance organizations
(HMOs), and billed claims, including inpatient and outpatient services, procedures, and diagnoses.
Sample Selection
We identified all individuals in the linked SEER-Medicare
database who were diagnosed with primary esophageal cancer (International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision
[ICD-9] codes 150.0-150.9) from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2002 (n ¼ 15,980) who had esophageal cancer
as their first primary malignancy and, among them, those
aged 65 years (n ¼ 10,389). We excluded 1127 patients
for the following reasons: The original reason for Medicare
entitlement was not aged 65 years, the date of death in
SEER and Medicare differed by >3 months, or the reporting source of death was autopsy or death certificate. We
excluded an additional 3418 patients who were enrolled in
an HMO at any point from 12 months before to 6 months
after the date of diagnosis and/or were not covered by Medicare Parts A or B at any point during that period. An additional 3995 patients were excluded because they had in situ
disease, they had American Joint Committee on Cancer
stage III or IV disease, or they had unknown tumor classification or lymph node status (grading determined according
to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system). There were 1559 patients who had histologically confirmed esophageal cancer and stage I (T1N0) or stage II
(T2N0, T3N0, T1N1, T2N1) disease. Of these, 829
patients were excluded for the following reasons: unknown
radiation status; first treatment >4 months after the date of
diagnosis; receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiation before
surgery; receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiation within 4
months of surgery; or receipt of chemotherapy or radiation
alone, but not both.
The SEER database includes age, race/ethnicity, sex,
marital status, and area of residence. Age at diagnosis was
broken down into pentads (5-year discrete numeric intervals) starting at age 65 years. Because the sample included
few patients who were neither black nor white, we designated race as black, white, or other. For similar reasons,
4925

Original Article

we recoded the SEER martial status variable into married,
not married, and unknown.
The patients who were included in the current analyses were categorized by treatment received (esophagectomy
or CRT), age group at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race/ethnicity, sex, marital status, tumor stage (I or II), tumor grade
(well differentiated/moderately differentiated or poorly differentiated), comorbidity score, residence (rural area vs
urban area), and socioeconomic status (SES) quintile.
Esophagectomy Group

We identified all patients who underwent an esophagectomy within 4 months of the date of diagnosis using
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (43100,
43101, 43107, 43108, 43112, 43113, 43116-43118,
43121-43124) and ICD-9 surgery codes (424, 42404242, 4399). Any patient who received chemotherapy
and/or radiation therapy at any time before the date of
surgery or within 4 months after the date of surgery was
excluded from the current analysis. The receipt of chemotherapy or radiation >4 months after surgery was considered likely to be treatment for recurrent disease, and these
patients remained in the esophagectomy-only group.
Chemoradiation Group

We identified all patients who received both chemotherapy and radiation therapy that started within 4
months of the date of diagnosis. Receipt of chemotherapy
was defined by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding
Systems codes J9000 through J9999. Receipt of radiation
therapy was defined by the following codes: ICD-9 codes
V580, V671, and 9220 through 9229; and CPT codes
77331 through 77336, 77370, 77399, 77401 through
77404, 77406 through 77409, 77411 through 77414,
77416 through 77420, 77422, 77423, 77425, 77427,
77430 through 77432, 77435, 77470, 77499, 77750,
77761 through 77763, 77776 through 77778, 77781
through 77784, 77789, 77790, and 77799. Any patient
who underwent esophagectomy was not included in this
group. Any patient who received chemotherapy without
radiation or who received radiation without chemotherapy was excluded from analysis.
The validity of the SEER-Medicare claims data for
chemotherapy use has been described previously.17,18
Medicare claims are generated for diagnostic procedures,
diagnoses, and treatments for which hospitals and physi4926

cians bill, including, for cancer patients, intravenous and
injectable chemotherapy.
Socioeconomic Status

We generated an aggregate SES score from a hierarchy of income data from the 2000 Census according to
the method described by Du et al19 Patients were grouped
into quintiles based on a formula that incorporated data
related to income, poverty, and education. Patients for
whom all these values were missing were assigned to the
lowest SES category.
Comorbid Disease

We computed a comorbidity score for each patient
using the variables included in the adaptation by Klabunde et al of the Charlson Comorbidity Index.20-22
Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims were searched
from 365 days before to 30 days after the diagnosis of
esophageal cancer for all ICD-9-Clinical Modification
diagnostic codes corresponding to each of the following
comorbid conditions: myocardial infarction, congestive
heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular
disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, connective
tissue disease, peptic ulcer disease, mild-to-severe liver disease, diabetes with or without end-organ damage, hemiplegia, moderate or severe renal disease, and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome. Each condition was
weighted, and patients were assigned a score based on the
Klabunde-Charlson index.22
Statistical Analysis
We used chi-square tests to compare patients who underwent esophagectomy or who received CRT with respect
to clinical and demographic factors. We used logistic
regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each factor that was associated
with treatment (ie, esophagectomy or CRT). The variables that were included in this model were sex, age, year
of diagnosis, marital status, race/ethnicity, residence
(urban or rural), SES, comorbid disease score, tumor
stage, and tumor grade. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were generated and compared using the log-rank test. To
estimate the association between type of treatment and
death from either esophageal cancer or from any cause
while controlling for the other covariates, we used

adenocarcinoma were significantly less likely to receive
CRT (OR, 0.24; 95%CI, 0.16-0.35), as were patients
with stage II disease (OR, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.48-0.94).
Overall survival in the esophagectomy group was significantly better than that in the CRT group (Fig. 1).
These differences were more pronounced for adenocarcinoma than for squamous cell carcinoma. The 3-year and
5-year overall and disease-specific survival rates are shown
in Table 3. In multivariate Cox analyses, the receipt of
CRT was associated with significantly worse diseasespecific survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95%CI, 1.642.64) and overall survival (HR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.58-2.34)
(Table 4). Other factors that were associated with worse
overall survival included stage II disease, poorly differentiated tumors, increased comorbidities, and older age. Black
race was associated with improved overall survival. Among
patients the who underwent esophagectomy, 24 (7.7%)
died within 30 days of the date of surgery.
We hypothesized that there was a potentially strong
selection bias with regard to the receipt of CRT or undergoing esophagectomy. Therefore, we repeated the analyses
using propensity scoring to obtain a better estimate of the
treatment group effect. The receipt of CRT remained
strongly associated with worse disease-specific survival
Cancer

(HR, 2.21; 95%CI, 1.74-2.81) and worse overall survival
(HR, 2.05; 95%CI, 1.68-2.49).
In multivariate analyses that were stratified by cell
type, CRT in patients with adenocarcinoma was associated
with significantly worse disease-specific survival and overall
survival (Table 5). In patients with squamous cell carcinoma,
however, there was no significant difference in survival
between CRT and esophagectomy. Separate stratified analyses also were performed by tumor stage. The receipt of CRT
in patients who had stage I disease was associated with a
higher risk of esophageal cancer-specific mortality than in
patients who had stage II disease (stage I: HR, 3.50; 95%CI,
2.40-5.11; stage II: HR, 1.32; 95%CI, 0.95-1.83).
To facilitate a better assessment of the treatment
group effect without the impact of early death, multivariate analyses also were performed after excluding the
patients who died within 4 months of treatment. Again,
the receipt of CRT was associated with worse disease-specific survival (HR, 2.61; 95%CI, 2.01-3.39) and worse
overall survival (HR, 2.46; 95%CI, 1.98-3.05).

associated with improved disease-free and overall survival
compared with combined CRT. These findings were
most apparent for patients who had adenocarcinoma and
in those with stage I disease.
The decision whether to perform esophagectomy on
an elderly patient with esophageal cancer often is difficult
to make and encompasses many immeasurable factors. Several steps were taken to exclude patients who did not
undergo esophagectomy because of very poor baseline
health status. The nonoperative treatment group received
both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (not just 1 or the
other), we adjusted for comorbidities in the final multivariate models, and the analyses were repeated using propensity
scoring, an analytic method used to minimize the effects of
selection bias in a nonrandomized study.23 In addition, the
analyses were repeated without the patients who died
within 4 months of treatment (esophagectomy or CRT) to
exclude the sickest patients, who may have been distributed
unevenly between the 2 treatment groups. The results from
all of these analyses demonstrated a consistent 2-fold to 3fold improved disease-free survival and overall survival in
those patients who underwent esophagectomy. However,
these statistical methods can only partially overcome the
effects of the powerful selection bias inherent to the study
question that we attempted to address.
It is noteworthy that patients with stage II disease
were more likely than those with stage I disease to undergo
esophagectomy. The reasons for this finding are not
clearly intuitive, because it would be reasonable to anticipate that the ability to tolerate esophagectomy would be
correlated inversely with tumor stage. We suspect that a
Cancer

greater proportion of patients with stage II disease who
were unfit to tolerate surgery or CRT may have been
excluded from the analyses, resulting in a healthier group
that was more likely to undergo esophagectomy. Older
age was associated with increased odds of receiving CRT,
because older age is a known risk factor for surgical morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy.3
We observed that squamous cell histology was associated strongly with receipt of CRT. Cervical and upper
esophageal tumors are almost exclusively of squamous cell
histology, and tumors of this region can be more difficult
to resect technically because of their proximity to the
major airways and potential for local invasion. There are
published retrospective series of patients with localized
squamous cell carcinoma that report comparable outcomes between CRT and esophagectomy.24-26 Thus,
some medical oncologists may have been more likely to
refer ‘‘borderline’’ surgical candidates with squamous cell
carcinoma for CRT instead of surgery.
Our current results support the notion that response
to CRT in esophageal cancer varies greatly by cell type.
We observed a large survival advantage for esophagectomy
in patients with adenocarcinoma, whereas there was no
significant difference in survival between CRT and esophagectomy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. It is
possible that there is a small benefit to esophagectomy
over CRT in squamous cell carcinoma, and our study simply may have been underpowered to detect this survival
difference.
There are randomized clinical trials suggesting that
CRT may produce outcomes comparable to those

achieved with esophagectomy in squamous cell carcinoma.11,12 In a study of patients with locally advanced
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients who
received CRT alone and patients who received CRT followed by esophagectomy.11 However, the survival curves
diverged at 2 years in favor of CRT plus esophagectomy.
Our survival curves for patients with squamous cell carcinoma followed a similar pattern, possibly indicative of
disease recurrence 2 years after treatment with CRT.
In stratified analyses, we observed a larger survival
benefit for esophagectomy in patients who had stage I
disease compared with patients who had stage II disease.
A recent retrospective, multicenter study reported low
incidences of systemic disease after esophagectomy alone
for early stage disease.27 However, according to NCCN
guidelines, neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy
or CRT is acceptable for stage II disease.13 Because neoadjuvant therapy is not recommended for stage I disease, the observed survival benefit for esophagectomy in
this group may more closely reflect the true effect of
this treatment.
It is noteworthy that black patients had better allcause and esophageal cancer-specific survival compared
with white patients. In a SEER analysis by Greenstein
et al,28 black race was associated with a nonsignificant
increased risk of death from any cause; however, >50% of
the patients in that study did not undergo surgery or
receive radiation. Blacks are less likely to receive radiation
or chemotherapy or to undergo surgery for esophageal
cancer,14 and the disparate findings may be explained in
part by the finding that, in the current study, blacks and
whites all received treatment (esophagectomy or CRT).
The current study has several strengths. We compared 2 distinct treatment options for early stage esophageal cancer—esophagectomy and CRT—as opposed to a
single treatment compared with partial or no treatment.
By performing stratified analyses, we were able to identify
particular subgroups in whom esophagectomy was associated with better outcomes (stage I disease, adenocarcinoma) and others in whom CRT may be a reasonable
alternative (squamous cell carcinoma). Many immeasurable factors go into a decision whether or not to perform
esophagectomy on a patient with esophageal cancer, thus
introducing potential selection bias. Propensity scoring
serves to minimize the effects of selection bias in a non4932

randomized study, and these analyses also demonstrated a
consistent benefit for esophagectomy.
There are certain limitations to our analyses. Tumor
staging is most accurate in patients who undergo esophagectomy. Clinical staging in the CRT group presumably
was based on endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography, or other tests; and the direction in which the results
would have been biased it is not clear. The TNM tumor
stage reported in SEER is derived from a computer algorithm that combines elements of pathologic data and clinical data to derive a ‘‘best stage,’’ which limits our ability
to perform analyses that assess the accuracy of clinical
staging in this dataset.
Despite our best efforts to minimize its effects, selection bias still may have a significant impact on our findings.
Although the current study reports death from esophageal
cancer or from any cause as the primary outcomes, we did
not evaluate other important outcomes, such as the need
for eventual palliative interventions. The results of 1
randomized trial demonstrated that, despite a lack of benefit with regard to overall survival, esophagectomy (compared with CRT) was associated with significantly fewer
palliative stenting procedures for recurrent disease.12
Despite the high surgical mortality associated with
esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, the results of these
analyses suggest that surgery alone may be associated with
significantly improved overall and disease-specific survival
compared with CRT for the treatment of early stage esophageal cancer in the elderly. The findings were most evident
for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. There may
be a subgroup of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
patients for in whom CRT is an acceptable alternative to
esophagectomy. Given the potentially strong selection bias
inherent to the current study design, a randomized clinical
trial that includes adequate numbers of both cell types will
be needed to confirm the optimal treatment for early stage
esophageal cancer in the elderly.
