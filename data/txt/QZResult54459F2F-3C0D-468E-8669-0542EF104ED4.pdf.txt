ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers, with
less than 5% of patients surviving 5 years beyond diagnosis. Systemic therapies,
particularly gemcitabine, have a modest clinical benefit, but chemoresistance
limits their efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that plasma miR-33a levels positively
correlated with miR-33a levels in tumor tissues of patients with PDAC and are a good
prognostic indicator of overall survival. Overexpression of miR-33a inhibited tumor
cell proliferation and increased the chemosensitivity to gemcitabine both in vitro
and in vivo. Moreover, miR-33a targets Pim-3 directly in PDAC. Pim-3 expression
was a prognostic indicator related to poor survival in pancreatic cancer patients.
Plasma miR-33a levels were significantly lower in pancreatic cancer patients with
high Pim-3 protein expression than in healthy controls. Furthermore, overexpression
of miR-33a in pancreatic cancer cell lines suppressed Pim-3 expression, leading to
downregulation of the AKT/Gsk-3β/β-catenin pathway. Overall, these results indicate
that miR-33a functions as a tumor suppressor that downregulates Pim-3 kinase
expression to inhibit both pancreatic tumor growth and gemcitabine resistance via
the AKT/β-catenin pathway. Hence, detection of plasma miR-33a may be a simple
and convenient method of predicting therapeutic responses.

chemotherapeutic agent used for the palliative treatment
of patients with PDAC [3]. However, the tumors in a
substantial number of patients are already (or rapidly
become) chemoresistant to gemcitabine [2]. Recent
studies identified several chemoresistant mechanisms
associated with the metabolism and molecular targets of
gemcitabine [4, 5]. Combining gemcitabine with a targeted
therapeutic strategy may be beneficial for the treatment of
gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one
of the most deadly human malignant neoplasms and the
fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States [1]. With an overall 5 year survival rate <5% and
a median survival of <1 year, pancreatic cancer has an
extremely poor prognosis [2]. Gemcitabine, which has
been available for more than a decade, is the only first-line

RESULTS

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of singlestranded, small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene
expression by interfering with specific mRNAs at the
post-transcriptional level [6]. By regulating the expression
of cancer-specific genes, miRNAs can function as either
oncogenes or tumor suppressors [7, 8]. Dysregulated
miRNAs are associated with PDAC proliferation,
invasion, chemosensitivity, and prognosis [9]. A more
complete understanding of the unique patterns of
dysregulated miRNAs in PDAC may identify potential
therapeutic targets or molecular biomarkers and improve
tumor diagnosis or predictions of therapeutic responses.
Previous studies examined the contributions of
miRNAs to pancreatic carcinogenesis and diagnosis.
For example, let-7 expression is significantly lower in
pancreatic cancer cells than in normal acinar pancreatic
tissue; restoration of let-7 expression inhibits cell
proliferation, K-ras expression, and mitogen-activated
protein kinase activation, but does not inhibit tumor
growth after intratumoral gene transfer [10]. Moreover,
miR-34 restores the tumor-suppressive function of
p53 in p53-deficient human pancreatic cancer cells by
modulating downstream Notch signaling and Bcl-2; it
also plays an important role in self-renewal of pancreatic
cancer cells [11]. By contrast, miR-21 is upregulated
in pancreatic cancer cells, where it targets PTEN,
PDCD4, TPM1, and TMP3, leading to the inhibition of
apoptosis [12].
Pim-3, a member of the proto-oncogene Pim
family, exhibits serine/threonine kinase activity [13] and
has high sequence similarity to Pim-1 and Pim-2 [14].
We previously showed that Pim-3 protein expression
is increased in premalignant and malignant lesions of
endoderm-derived organs such as the pancreas, colon,
liver, and stomach, whereas it is expressed at barely
detectable levels in these normal adult organs [15].
Moreover, Pim-3 regulates tumor cell proliferation,
survival, and apoptosis during early carcinogenesis
[16, 17]. A recent study demonstrated that inhibiting
Pim-3 kinase sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to
gemcitabine [18]. However, the precise mechanisms by
which signaling responses contribute to Pim-3-mediated
pancreatic carcinogenesis and chemoresistance remain to
be elucidated.
Here, we showed that miR-33a acts as an important
suppressor of human pancreatic cancer by directly
regulating Pim-3 expression at the post-transcriptional
level. Overexpression of miR-33a led to a marked
downregulation of Pim-3 expression, thereby inhibiting
AKT/Gsk-3β/β-catenin signaling, which in turn reduced
cell proliferation and increased the chemosensitivity
of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine both in vitro
and in vivo. The results suggest that the plasma level of
miR-33a may be a valuable biomarker and an important
prognostic factor for human pancreatic cancer.

Plasma miR-33a expression is positively
correlated with tissue miR-33a expression
and an improved prognosis for patients with
pancreatic cancer
MiR-33a expression is associated with an improved
prognosis for PDAC [19]. Therefore, we first examined
miR-33a levels in the plasma of 106 PDAC patients and
100 healthy controls. We found that plasma miR-33a
levels were higher in healthy controls than in PDAC
patients (Figure 1A). Low plasma miR-33a levels were
significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.0381;
Table 1). A Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that low
levels of plasma miR-33a led to a significant reduction
in the overall survival of 79 PDAC patients (Figure 1B).
Moreover, in situ hybridization detected visible and
gradable expression of miR-33a in tissue samples from
the 106 PDAC patients (Figure 1C). Also, miR-33a levels
in the plasma positively correlated with miR-33a levels
in the pancreatic tumors of the 106 patients (Figure 1D).

MiR-33a inhibits cell proliferation and increases
the chemosensitivity of human pancreatic cancer
cells to gemcitabine both in vitro and in vivo
Since the poor prognosis for PDAC is due
in part to chemoresistance [2], we next examined
the relationship between miR-33a and gemcitabine
resistance in vitro. Stable expression of miR-33a in
the SW1990 and MiaPaca-2 pancreatic cancer cell
lines (SW1990-miR-33a and Mia-2-miR-33a) led to a
significant reduction in growth (Figure 2A) and in the
IC50 value of gemcitabine for SW1990 and MiaPaca-2
cells (Table 2). In addition, overexpression of miR-33a
increased the sensitivity of both cell lines to gemcitabine
in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 2B and 2C).
To assess the function of miR-33a in vivo, SW1990 or
SW1990-miR-33a cells were subcutaneously implanted
into nude mice. Tumor growth in the gemcitabinetreated SW1990-miR-33a group was slower than that
in the PBS-treated and gemcitabine-treated SW1990
groups (Figure 2D). Furthermore, overexpression of
miR-33a in gemcitabine-treated SW1990 cells resulted in
fewer tumors in these mice (Figure 2E). Similar results
were obtained using mice injected with MiaPaca-2 and
Mia-2-miR-33a cells (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B).
There was a significant negative correlation between
xenograft size and miR-33a expression (Figure 2F;
r = −0.8974, P = 0.0153), indicating that miR-33a
negatively regulates tumor volume by increasing the
chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine.
In addition, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that

stable expression of miR-33a acted synergistically with
gemcitabine to reduce the number of proliferating Ki67positive cells (Figure 2G and 2H).

(Figure 3B). To determine whether overexpression of
miR-33a reverses gemcitabine resistance, miR-33a was
stably expressed in SW1990-res and Mia-2-res cells to
generate SW1990-res-miR-33a and Mia-2-res-miR-33a
cells, respectively. We observed that overexpression
of miR-33a led to a significant reduction in the growth
rate of the resistant cell lines (Figure 3B). Moreover,
overexpression of miR-33a reduced the IC50 value of
gemcitabine towards the resistant cells (Table 2) and
reduced cell viability in both a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Figure 3C and 3D). Furthermore, overexpression
of miR-33a in SW1990-res cells repressed tumor
growth and reduced resistance to gemcitabine in vivo
(Figure 3E). Similarly, overexpression of miR-33a in
Mia-2-res cells reduced the tumor mass (Supplementary
Figure 2). There was a significant negative correlation
between xenograft size and miR-33a expression in mice

MiR-33a reverses the chemoresistance of human
pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine both
in vitro and in vivo
To confirm the hypothesis that miR-33a is involved
in chemoresistance of PDAC, we established stable
SW1990 and MiaPaca-2 cell lines that were resistant to
gemcitabine (SW1990-res and Mia-2-res); the resistance
indices (RI) for these cell lines were 215 (95% CI, 195.27–
234.73) and 173.1 (95% CI, 165.95–180.25), respectively
(Table 2). Notably, the resistant cells expressed low levels
of miR-33a (Figure 3A), and their growth rates were
higher than those of the corresponding parental cell lines

shrinkage ratio was most marked in mice that received
xenografts of non-resistant cells stably overexpressing
miR-33a (Supplementary Figure 3). In addition, stable
expression of miR-33a reduced the number of proliferating

transfected with negative control mimics (cel-miR-239b)
(Figure 4C). However, no Pim-3 mRNA was detected
in the IgG immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Next,
to determine whether Pim-3 is a direct target of miR33a in pancreatic cancer, PCI55 and MiaPaca-2 cells
were co-transfected with the miRNA mimics together
with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the wildtype 3′UTR of Pim-3 or the same region harboring a
mutation in the miR-33a seed sequence (Δ3′UTR;
Figure 4D). Co-transfection of both cell lines with the
miR-33a mimics repressed the luciferase activity of the
wild-type Pim-3 3′UTR construct, but not that of the
Pim-3 Δ3′UTR construct or empty psiCHECK-2 vector
(Figure 4E). Moreover, the luciferase activity of the
wild-type Pim-3 3′UTR construct was not repressed
by co-transfection of the cells with the cel-miR-239b
mimics (Figure 4E). Furthermore, we also found that
the expression levels of miR-33a in seven pancreatic
cancer cell lines were negatively correlated with those of
Pim-3 protein (Figure 4F and 4G; Spearman’s r = −0.79,
P < 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that
Pim-3 is a true target of miR-33a in pancreatic cancer
cell lines.

MiR-33a directly targets the 3′UTR of Pim-3 in
pancreatic cancer cell lines
A previous study shows that miR-33a interact
with Pim-1 in cancer cells [20]. Kinases belonging to
the Pim family are highly homologous [14], suggesting
that miRNAs that bind Pim-1 may also bind Pim-3 via
a similar complementary sequence in the 3′UTR of the
mRNA. To examine whether miR-33a bound to Pim-3, we
performed in silico analyses of putative miRNA-binding
sites in Pim-3 mRNA using different algorithms (www.
ebi.ac.uk; www.microrna.org; and www.targetscan.org).
A computational analysis (www.targetscan.org) revealed
that miR-33a bound to a highly conserved sequence
within the 3′UTR of Pim-3 that is conserved across
different vertebrates (Figure 4A). Moreover, transfection
of MiaPaca-2 and PCI55 pancreatic cancer cells with miR33a mimics led to a significant reduction in the expression
of Pim-3 protein, but not in Pim-3 mRNA expression
(Figure 4B).
Drosophila AGO1, a component of the RNAinduced silencing complex, represses translation
triggered by binding of miRNAs to imperfect
complementary sites in the 3′UTRs of their mRNA
targets [21–23]. To determine whether miR-33amediated downregulation of Pim-3 requires AGO1,
a RIP analysis was performed using an anti-AGO1
antibody or IgG (control). The amount of Pim-3 mRNA
associated with AGO1 was significantly higher in
MiaPaca-2 and PCI55 pancreatic cancer cells transfected
with miR-33a mimics than in parental cells or cells

Pim-3 expression is negatively correlated with
miR-33a expression and a poor prognosis
To study the relationship between miR-33a and
Pim-3 in pancreatic cancer, the expression levels of
Pim-3 in tissue samples from 106 patients with PDAC
were determined and graded by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 5A). Pim-3 protein was expressed at high levels
in 54.7% (58/106) of the pancreatic cancer tissues,
and Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that high Pim3 expression was associated with a poor prognosis in
79 pancreatic cancer patients (Figure 5B and 5C).
Moreover, serial sections of the tissues revealed a
negative correlation between miR-33a and Pim-3
expression (Figure 5C; P < 0.05). Furthermore, the
miR-33a levels in plasma samples from the 106 PDAC
patients were negatively correlated with the levels of

expression are specific to pancreatic cancer cells that we
examined.
Pim-3 may be a novel regulator of AKT and
Wnt/β-catenin signaling [25]. Hence, we next examined
whether overexpression of miR-33a reduces β-catenin
levels in SW1990 and MiaPaca-2 cells. Overexpression
of miR-33a failed to reduce the total amount of AKT
protein. However, the levels of endogenous Pim-3,
phospho-AKT, and phospho-glycogen synthase
kinase 3β (phospho-Gsk-3β) were reduced markedly
under these conditions, and these changes facilitated
β-catenin destruction (Figure 6B). Transient transfection
of SW1990-miR-33a and Mia-2-miR-33a cells with
Pim-3 cDNA restored the amounts of phospho-AKT,
phospho-Gsk-3β, and β-catenin proteins, but did not
affect the total amount of AKT protein (Figure 6B).
Moreover, transfection with Pim-3 cDNA also rescued
cell growth (Figure 6C) and restored resistance to
gemcitabine (Figure 6D), both of which were inhibited
by miR-33a overexpression. In accordance with the

MiaPaca-2 pancreatic cancer cells (SW1990-miR-33a
and Mia-2-miR-33a) led to a reduction in the level
of Pim-3 protein but not that of mRNA (Figure

kinase 6 (CDK6) reduces cell proliferation [20, 24],
we found that overexpression of miR-33a did not
downregulate CDK6 protein in SW1990 or MiaPaca-2

These observations provide the missing experimental
evidence for the tumor-suppressive effect of miR-33a in
human pancreatic cancer.
MiR-33a
induces
cisplatin-resistance
in
osteosarcoma cells by downregulating the transcription
factor, TWIST [34]. By contrast, the results presented
herein indicate that the level of miR-33a expression
was significantly lower in gemcitabine-resistant cells
than in parental cells. Therefore, it is possible that the
gemcitabine-sensitizing effect of miR-33a is a cell- or
tissue-specific phenomenon. Although miRNA expression
is regulated by a number of stimuli [35], the mechanism by
which miR-33a expression is inhibited after gemcitabine
treatment remains unknown.
Our previous study indicated that Pim-3 is important
for cell growth, apoptosis, and cell-cycle progression in
human pancreatic cancer [16], although miR-124 targets
Pim-3 in glioblastoma stem cells [36]. However, little is
known about other miRNAs that target this kinase. The
Pim kinase family consists of three members, namely,
Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3, which exhibit marked sequence
similarity, especially within their kinase domains. Notably,
a number of miRNAs regulate Pim-1 kinase [37], and
bioinformatics analyses revealed that some of these
miRNAs may also bind Pim-3. Based on these analyses,
miR-33a was identified and confirmed as a novel miRNA
that directly binds to Pim-3. The miR-33a target sequence
within the 3′UTR of Pim-3 is evolutionarily conserved,
suggesting that it plays an important functional role.
Moreover, stable expression of miR-33a in pancreatic
cancer cells led to a significant downregulation of Pim-3
protein expression and inhibited cancer cell growth
both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we previously
showed that human pancreatic cancer cells express much
lower levels of Pim-1 and Pim-2 mRNA than Pim-3
mRNA [38]. Thus, it is likely that miR-33a inhibits cell
growth mainly by binding to Pim-3 in human pancreatic
cancer cells.
A recent study showed that Pim-3 is involved
in acquired gemcitabine resistance [18], and that it is
a positive regulator of cell survival that increases the
threshold for drug-induced apoptosis by upregulating
the expression of survival proteins. Consistent with this,
we found that miR-33a targeted Pim-3 to increase the
chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells and reverse the
chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine
both in vitro and in vivo. High Pim-3 expression
correlated with a poor prognosis, and plasma miR-33a
levels were negatively correlated with the levels of Pim-3
in pancreatic tumors. Therefore, early examination of
miR-33a expression in the plasma and Pim-3 expression
in tissues may aid the development of new therapeutic
strategies and predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer.
However, preclinical and clinical studies with large sample
sizes and longer follow-up times are required to confirm
the utility of these potential biomarkers.

above results, stable expression of Pim-3 upregulated the
levels of phospho-AKT, phospho-Gsk-3β, and β-catenin
in MiaPaca-2 cells, whereas silencing of endogenous
Pim-3 expression by stable transfection of PCI55 cells
with a Pim-3-specific shRNA reduced the expression
levels of these proteins markedly (Figure 6E). Pim and
AKT kinases phosphorylate similar substrates and
mediate a number of overlapping pathways [18, 26, 27].
Hence, we hypothesized that, like AKT [28], Pim-3
may also phosphorylate Gsk-3β to upregulate β-catenin
expression. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed
that Pim-3 bound to Gsk-3β and phospho-Gsk-3β in PCI55
cells (Figure 6F), indicating a potential AKT-independent
effect of Pim-3 on the β-catenin pathway.
Notably, resistant cells expressed high levels of
Pim-3 protein (Figure 6G). In line with previous reports
[29, 30], we found that the AKT/β-catenin signaling
was activated in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic
cancer cells, and that overexpression of miR-33a
reversed  the  increased  expression of β-catenin by
inhibiting Pim-3/AKT/β-catenin signaling (Figure  6G).
Together with the fact that miR-33a induces the
downregulation of β-catenin directly [31], or indirectly
by regulating Pim-3/AKT/Gsk-3β (Figure 6E and 6F),
these results reveal that the negative correlation between
miR-33a expression and β-catenin expression determines
gemcitabine resistance.

DISCUSSION
The results of the in vitro and in vivo assays
presented herein demonstrate that miR-33a downregulates
the proto-oncogene encoding Pim-3 kinase. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to (i) demonstrate
that plasma miR-33a levels could be a valuable biomarker
and an important prognostic factor for human pancreatic
cancer; (ii) provide evidence that miR-33a synergistically
increases the sensitivity of PDAC cells to gemcitabine;
(iii) identify Pim-3 as a direct binding target of
miR-33a; and (iv) demonstrate that miR-33a
downregulates Pim-3 to inhibit tumor growth and
chemoresistance, in part via the AKT/Gsk-3β/β-catenin
signaling cascade, in pancreatic cancer.
Circulating miRNAs enable communication
between normal cells and cancer cells [32, 33], and
plasma miRNA levels may reflect clinical information
correlated to tumors. The data presented herein highlight
the potential clinical utility of plasma miR-33a levels as a
valuable biomarker that reflects the expression of miR-33a
in human pancreatic cancer tissues. MiRNAs are key
components of tumorigenesis, and they participate in
many cellular processes, including cell proliferation
and differentiation [9]. Here, we found that miR-33a
suppressed both the proliferation and growth of pancreatic
cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-33a was inversely
correlated with both the number and size of the tumors.

part, via downregulation of the Pim-3 proto-oncogene.
Loss of miR-33a expression, leading to the induction of
Pim-3 expression, appears to be a critical event in the
development of gemcitabine resistance.

MiR-33a inhibited the Pim-3 kinase-mediated AKT/
Gsk-3β/β-catenin pathway in pancreatic cancer cells.
Similarly, a previous study showed that hepatocarcinoma
cancer cells overexpressing miR-33a display reduced AKT
phosphorylation, which affects insulin signaling [39]. By
contrast, Li’s group showed that miR-33a promotes the
TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of AKT in hepatic
stellate cells, which activates the cells to produce excess
extracellular matrix, leading to liver fibrosis [40]. This
discrepancy may be explained by the fact that a single
miRNA can target multiple genes; these target genes may
differ in specific cells to enable the control of different
signaling pathways [37]. Because Pim-3 mRNA and
protein is barely detectable in normal hepatocytes [16],
miR-33a may fail to target this kinase and inhibit cell
proliferation in hepatic stellate cells, which are the primary
mesenchymal cells in the liver. Instead of an anti-tumor
effect, the major role of miR-33a in normal cells may be to
regulate lipid metabolism and/or fibrosis. By contrast, the
anti-tumor effects of miR-33a might be dominant in cancer
cells displaying AKT activation. MiR-33a is an essential
regulator of cholesterol and lipid metabolism [41]. Hence,
the findings presented here expand the biological functions
of miR-33a and improve our current understanding of the
relationship between metabolism and carcinogenesis.
Pim-3 can promote cell proliferation and increase
gemcitabine resistance by activating AKT/β-catenin
signaling. Several lines of evidence implicate Pim-3 in
activating STAT3Tyr705 and BadSer112 phosphorylation,
which leads to the expression of a number of antiapoptotic proteins, including Bcl-XL and survivin [16, 42].
Moreover, activating STAT3 increases the transcription
of Hif-1α, thereby upregulating the expression of the
MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) gene, resulting in reduced
chemosensitivity [43, 44]. Furthermore, other groups
report that Pim-3 increases cell proliferation via p21Cip1,
p27Kip1, and Cdc25C [38, 45]. Here, we found that Pim-3
stabilized and promoted the accumulation of cytoplasmic
β-catenin, which upregulates cyclin D1 to promote cellcycle progression, and upregulates the expression of
survivin to inhibit apoptosis [46]. Notably, the MDR1
gene acts downstream of β-catenin [47], suggesting
that Pim-3 may contribute to MDR1 expression and
gemcitabine resistance by upregulating β-catenin. Overall,
we found that Pim-3 upregulated the levels of phosphoAKT, phospho-Gsk-3β, and β-catenin in gemcitabineresistant cells; all of these molecules are associated with
gemcitabine resistance [47–49]. AKT/Gsk-3β/β-catenin
signaling is a component of the Wnt signaling pathway,
which is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition
[50]. Therefore, we hypothesize that Pim-3 might also
induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition to mediate drug
resistance.
Taken together, the results reported herein show that
miR-33a is a potent tumor suppressor in the pancreas and
that its growth inhibitory effects are mediated, at least in

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human tissues and cell culture
A total of 106 human primary pancreatic
adenocarcinoma tissues were collected between 2010
and 2012 at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center.
The samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and histologically examined in a timely manner.
All samples were obtained with informed consent, and
the project was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics
Committee of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center.
The PCI35 and PCI55 human pancreatic carcinoma
cell lines were a gift from Professor Mukaida Naofumi
(Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan). The SW1990,
MiaPaca-2, PANC-1, BxPC-3, and Capan-1 human
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). SW1990
and Capan-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (Biosera), and all other cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 (Biosera). All media were
supplemented with 10% FBS (Biosera), and the cells
were cultured at 37°C in an incubator containing 5% CO2.
The cell lines were authenticated by DNA profiling of
short tandem repeats and amelogenin (Beijing Microread
Genetics Co. Ltd.).

Isolation of plasma miRNA
Before extracting miRNA, 5 μl of 200 pM
cel-miR-39 mimics (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China) were
added to 200 μl of plasma as an external standard. MiRNA
was extracted from plasma using the miRcute miRNA
isolation Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co. Ltd.), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, the miRNA
was reverse transcribed prior to use in quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The relative expression of
target miRNA was analyzed by the ΔCt method.

Real-time qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR
was
performed
as
described
previously [38]. Detailed information is provided in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Locked nucleic acid in situ hybridization
Locked nucleic acid in situ hybridization analyses
of PDAC tissues were performed using a human miR-33aspecific double digoxigenin-labeled locked nucleic acid
probe (Exiqon). Briefly, following deparaffinization and

rehydration, tissue sections were treated with proteinase
K at 37°C for 15 min and dehydrated through a graded
series of ethanol solutions (70–100%). The slides were
then incubated at 50°C overnight with a digoxigeninlabeled probe diluted to 250 nM in hybridization buffer.
After stringent washes with 5× , 1× , and 0.2× SSC buffers
at 50°C for 30 min, the slides were blocked with blocking
reagent (Roche) at 37°C for 30 min and then incubated
with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin at
37°C for 30 min. Colorimetric detection was performed
by incubating the slides with 4-nitro-blue tetrazolium and
5-bromo-4-chloro-30-indolylphosphate substrate (Roche)
at 37°C for 120 min, followed by nuclear fast counterstain
for 20 min. The tissue sections were examined in a
blinded manner by a second individual. Scoring was
based on the intensity of hybridization, which was
designated as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (intermediate), or
3 (strong), and the percentage of positive cells, which was
designated as 0 (<1%), 1 (focal, 1–30%), or 2 (diffuse,
>30%). The following expression levels were based
on the score obtained by multiplying the positivity and
intensity scores: 0, negative (−); 1–3, weakly positive (+);
4–6, moderately positive (++); and >6, strongly
positive (+++).

MiaPaca-2 and SW1990 cells were serially subcultured for 9 months in medium containing incrementally
increasing concentrations of gemcitabine (Sigma). The
starting concentrations for the MiaPaca-2 and SW1990
cells were 0.5 μM and 0.25 μM, respectively. Both
resistant cell lines (Mia-2-res and SW1990-res) retained
the capacity to proliferate when cultured in medium
containing gemcitabine (64 μM and 32 μM, respectively).
The resistant phenotype was stable for more than
20 passages.

Immunohistochemical analysis
Immunohistochemical staining was performed
as described previously [38]. Detailed information is
provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.

RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation
PCI55 and MiaPaca-2 cells were transfected
with miR-33a or negative control (cel-miR-239b)
mimics (RiboBio) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. At 48 h post-transfection, proteins were
cross-linked to RNA by incubating the cells with
0.75% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.
The cells were then harvested in RNA-binding protein
immunoprecipitation (RIP) lysis buffer [25 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40,
1 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 U/ml RNasin, and
1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics)]
and centrifuged for 15 min. Half of the supernatant was
collected in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as an extract
control, and the remainder was incubated with an antiArgonaute1 (AGO1) antibody (1:50; Cell Signaling
Technology) at 4°C overnight, followed by precipitation
with 50 μl of protein G Sepharose4 Fast Flow (GE
Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) for 4 h at 4°C. After washing
the beads six times with wash buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% NP40, 2 mM EDTA,
1 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 U/ml RNasin (Promega)],
proteinase K (Takara) was added, and the beads were
incubated for 1 h at 56°C. RNA was isolated using TRIzol
reagent, and qRT-PCR was performed as described above.

Cell viability and cell cytotoxicity assays
Cell viability and cell growth inhibition were
determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo
Laboratories), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Detailed information is provided in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Tumor formation assay in a nude mouse model
Eighty female BALB/c nude mice (5-weeks-old;
15–25 g) were randomly divided into eight groups. The
left flank of each mouse was inoculated subcutaneously
with 2 × 106 MiaPaca (Mia)-2, Mia-2-miR-33a, Mia-2-res,
or Mia-2-res-miR-33a cells, or with 3 × 106 SW1990,
SW1990-miR-33a, SW1990-res, or SW1990-res-miR-33a
cells. Seven days later, each group was randomly divided
into two subgroups (five mice per subgroup) and subjected
to intraperitoneal injection of gemcitabine (20 mg/kg)
or PBS (100 μl; negative control) every 4 days. Tumor
growth was measured twice per week using calipers.
Tumor volume was calculated using the following
formula: (length × width2)/2. At Day 35 post-tumor cell
injection, the tumor tissues were removed and subjected
to immunohistochemical and western blot analyses.
The study was performed in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of Fudan University. The protocol
was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of Fudan University [permit number: SYXK
(Hu) 2009–0082].
