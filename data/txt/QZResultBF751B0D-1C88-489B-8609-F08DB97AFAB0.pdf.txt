ABSTRACT
Background: The benefit of preoperative chemotherapy prior to pulmonary
metastasectomy for patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is unknown. Here, we
identify outcomes of preoperative chemotherapy in patients with resected primary
CRC who then underwent pulmonary metastasectomy.
Methods: We queried a prospective database to identify treatment characteristics.
Multivariate analyses identified predictors of overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS).
Results: 229 patients underwent lung metastasectomy, of whom 115 proceeded
to surgery without chemotherapy while 114 received preoperative regimen based
on oxaliplatin (32%), irinotecan (46%), capecitabine (16%), or other (6%).
Median PFS in preoperative chemotherapy vs. surgery alone arms were comparable
(p=0.004). Patients on oxaliplatin-based therapy had an improved OS vs. an
irinotecan, capecitabine, or alternate regimen (p=.019). On multivariate analysis,
the irinotecan subset had a worse OS (HR 1.846; 95% CI 1.070, 3.185) vs. surgery
alone arm (p=0.028). The OS of an oxaliplatin-based regimen vs. no chemotherapy
was inconclusive (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.237 to 1.389, p=0.218). Multivariate analysis
demonstrated a worse PFS and OS for the male gender and an incomplete resection
(R2).
Conclusion: Prospective trials on specific preoperative regimens and criteria for
patient selection may identify a role for preoperative chemotherapy prior to a curative
pulmonary metastasectomy.

INTRODUCTION

probability of 5-year survival in patients with resection
of oligometastatic pulmonary lesions [3-5]. Indeed, the
significant improvement in survival after resection of
pulmonary metastases in the absence of extrapulmonary
disease lesions has led to the widespread clinical practice
of surgical resection in these patient populations [1, 3, 5,
6]. Furthermore, improved progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS) has been noted in patients who
have undergone lung metastasectomy compared to those
who deferred surgery [7]. Similarly data even suggests
that lung metastases are not a poor prognostic factor for

Pulmonary recurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC)
following resection of the primary CRC lesion presents a
significant clinical problem because the lung is a common
site of extracolonic recurrence [1, 2]. The optimal
sequence of management of pulmonary oligometastatic
disease remains unclear, although emerging data indicate
a role for surgical resection in patients with metastases
in the lung alone. Surgical intervention for this subset of
patients has been explored with reports of 11% to 41%

survival in patients undergoing resections for both liver
and lung metastases, compared to liver metastases alone
[8]. However, most analyses are retrospective single
institution experiences and report a wide range of 5-year
survival ranging from 21% to 61%. Furthermore, OS was
associated with an elevated CEA level, tumor location
(unilateral vs. bilateral), and number of pulmonary
metastases [9-13]. Preoperative predictors of prognosis
may identify subsets of patients who may benefit from a
multimodal therapeutic strategy incorporating preoperative
chemotherapy prior to a potentially curative resection of
oligometastatic disease. The actual benefit of preoperative
chemotherapy prior to pulmonary metastasectomy, as
well as the optimal regimen, are not well defined and
require further analysis. Consequently, we investigate
the characteristics, treatment regimens, and outcomes of
patients with resected primary tumors who then underwent
pulmonary metastasectomy.

114 (50%) received preoperative chemotherapy prior to
resection of the pulmonary lesions. Of the 115 patients in
the surgery alone arm, 85 patients had early stage disease
(defined as any T, any N, M0) of colorectal cancer at
the time of their initial diagnosis while 24 patients had
stage IV disease (any T, any N, M1); in the preoperative
chemotherapy arm, 68 patients had early stage colorectal
cancer at the time of diagnosis while 40 patients had stage
IV disease. The initial disease status was unknown for 6
patients in each arm. Seventeen of 38 (45%) patients in the
preoperative chemotherapy arm who underwent molecular
testing demonstrated a KRAS mutation in codons 12, 13,
and 61. Similarly 14 of 32 (44%) tested patients in the
surgery alone arm had an identified KRAS mutation.
The median time to diagnosis of metastatic disease from
time of resection of the primary colorectal tumor to the
time of resection of the pulmonary metastases was 35.1
months (range, 1.0 – 143.4 months) in the preoperative
chemotherapy arm and 34.1 months (range, 2.2 – 149.2
months) in the surgery alone arm. Of the 115 patients who
proceed with surgery without preoperative chemotherapy,
the median number of metastatic lesions within the lung
was 1 (range, 1-7) and the median size of the largest
lung nodule was 1.4 cm (range, 0.3 – 10 cm). In the
preoperative chemotherapy arm, the median number of
pulmonary lesions was 2 (range, 1 – 16) with the median
size of the largest nodule being 1.8 cm (range, 0.2 –
14.5 cm). Baseline characteristics did vary significantly
among patients receiving the four groups of preoperative
regimens (Table 2). Specifically, a greater number of
patients who received preoperative chemotherapy prior to
pulmonary metastasectomy had stage IV disease at time
of initial colorectal cancer diagnosis (p=0.015), more than

Patient characteristics
We identified 8,712 patients with CRC who
were evaluated at MD Anderson from January 1, 2000,
to December 3, 2010; of these patients, 2,595 had
metastases to the lung. We characterized 229 consecutive
patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy at
our institution. Patient characteristics and description of
disease status are listed in Table 1. Of these 229 patients,
115 (50%) underwent surgical resection alone while

alone arm was 18.1 months (95% CI 14.6, 21.6) while the
preoperative chemotherapy arm demonstrated a median
PFS of 18.8 months (95% CI 15.1, 22.6). Of the 4 different
chemotherapy arms, the median PFS was 18.2 months
(95% CI 14.2, 22.2) in the irinotecan-based therapy arm,
19.6 months (95% CI 11.3, 27.9) in the oxaliplatin arm,
20.8 months (95% CI 12.0, 29.5) in the capecitabine
arm, and 27.7 months (95% CI 1.0, 54.4) among patients
receiving other systemic therapies.
For overall survival the median OS was not reached
among patients in the surgery alone arm subset (mean
OS 91.7 months, 95% CI 80.9, 102.5). Among the 4
preoperative chemotherapy arms, patients receiving an
irinotecan-based regimen represented the largest subset
among our patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy,
thereby serving as the reference group. This irinotecanreceiving subset had a worse OS (49.6 months; 95% CI
35.3, 63.9) in comparison to any chemotherapy regimen
(p 0.024). Patients receiving an oxaliplatin-based therapy
demonstrated an improved OS in comparison to an
irinotecan-based therapy group with a mean OS 81.0
months (95% CI 67.7, 94.4, p = 0.019) (Figure 1); the
median OS has not yet been reached in the oxaliplatingroup. Patients receiving a capecitabine-based regimen
demonstrated a median OS of 64.0 months (95% CI 52.9,
75.1) while patients on other systemic therapies did not
reach median OS (mean OS 50.3 months, 95% CI 30.7,
69.8).
The 67 patients who received a biologic drug
(bevacizumab, cetuximab, or panitumumab) as part of
their treatment regimen had a median PFS of 13.5 months
(95% CI 10.8, 16.2) in comparison to the 47 patients
who did not receive a biologic agent (median PFS 24.9
months; 95% CI 18.4, 31.4). However the median OS
did not differ significantly between these two groups
(p=0.144). Receiving a bevacizumab-based regimen did
not significantly impact median OS (51.5 months; 95%
CI 42.8, 60.2) when compared to patients receiving a
preoperative regimen that did not include bevacizumab
(55.1 months; 95% CI 48.9, 61.4, p=0.435).
On multivariate Cox regression analysis accounting
for age at time of pulmonary metastasectomy, gender, size
of largest pulmonary metastases, number of pulmonary
metastases and type of resection (R0, R1, or R2), the
PFS did not vary significantly among the 4 arms of
preoperative chemotherapy when compared to the surgery
alone arm (p=0.264) (Table 4). However, on multivariate
analysis of OS, the irinotecan-based chemotherapy group
did demonstrate a worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.846;
95% CI 1.070, 3.185; p=0.028) in reference to the surgery
alone arm (Table 5). The oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy
group trends in favor of an improved OS (HR 0.574; 95%
CI 0.237, 1.389) when compared to the surgery alone
arm (without chemotherapy) but did not reach statistical
significance (p=0.218).
The multivariate analysis also revealed a gender
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

predilection favoring women with men undergoing
pulmonary metastasectomy demonstrating a worse PFS
(HR 1.379; 95% CI 1.021, 1.862; p=0.036) and OS (HR
1.921; 95% CI 1.130, 3.267; p=0.016). Similarly, patients
who underwent an R2 resection demonstrate a poorer PFS
(HR 1.780; 95% CI 1.131, 2.803; p=0.013) and OS (HR
2.802; 95% CI 1.412, 5.561; p=0.003) when compared to
an R0 resection; no difference of significance was noted
in PFS (HR 1.139, p=0.561) or OS (HR 1.062, p=0.863)
among patients who underwent an R1 resection when
compared to an R0 resection.

DISCUSSION
Aggressive surgical intervention in pulmonary
oligometastatic disease has shown in previous
retrospective non-randomized studies to provide a 5-year
survival as high as 50% with a subset of patients being
cured after resection of their pulmonary metastases [2,
3, 6, 13-15]. However, the exact role for preoperative
chemotherapy with surgically resectable pulmonary
oligometastatic disease in CRC patients has not been
previously established. The characteristics of treatment
failure after pulmonary metastasectomy where there
is subsequent recurrence of disease may suggest that a
multimodality approach may potentially improve the
duration of recurrence-free survival in these patients [10,
16-18]. Our exploratory analysis suggests a potential role
for an oxaliplatin-based regimen if preoperative therapy
is considered prior to a potentially curative pulmonary
metastasectomy thereby improving overall survival benefit
in comparison to an irinotecan or capecitabine-based
regimen. In the current study, the use of bevacizumab did
not provide any additional benefit.
Patient selection for preoperative chemotherapy
prior to resection of lung metastases remains an area of
investigation. One independent analysis of our current
study’s patient population investigated clinical predictors
of recurrence in the lung among patients after their
initial CRC pulmonary metastasectomy; this work has
demonstrated increasing number of lung metastases and a
shorter preoperative disease free interval as predictors of
increased risk for lung recurrence [12]. Furthermore, the
same analysis characterized increasing age (greater than
60 years) and the male gender to independently predict
shorter survival with the lowest overall survival identified
among men older than 60 years of age with greater than 3
metastatic lesions in the lung (35.7 months, P <0.001) [12].
Indeed, the number of pulmonary metastases has predicted
for shorter overall survival in several large series [9, 11,
18, 19]. Indeed our analysis is limited by unmeasured
confounding variables including performance status and
comorbidities and their potential role in influencing patient
selection for preoperative chemotherapy prior to a curative
pulmonary metastasectomy. Additional factors limiting
our analysis include the single institution, retrospective

preoperative regimen based on oxaliplatin, irinotecan,
capecitabine, or other. Patients were allowed to receive
their preoperative chemotherapy outside the institution
for added convenience to the patient. All patients were
required to receive clinical evaluation by the Department
of Thoracic Surgery and all diagnostic imaging at MD
Anderson Cancer Center. The resected pulmonary tumor
size was defined as the maximal diameter on a computed
tomography scan in centimeters. In the case of multiple
pulmonary metastases, the diameter of the largest lesion
was noted to represent the tumor size. The institutional
review board granted an approval for this study with a
waiver of patient consent.

CONCLUSION
This exploratory analysis provides insight regarding
possible therapeutic approaches to this subset of patients
with oligometastatic disease in the lung with features
portending for a shorter PFS and OS. Additionally, there
is little literature that has clearly defined the appropriate
multimodality approach to this patient population. The
findings of favored overall survival after having received
an oxaliplatin-based regimen when compared to no
preoperative chemotherapy, remains to be investigate.
Upcoming trials on specific preoperative regimens and
criteria for patient selection are needed and planned. An
ongoing prospective phase III trial is the first such to
randomize patients with a prior resected colorectal cancer
to active monitoring or active monitoring with pulmonary
metastasectomy; primary endpoints include overall
survival, relapse-free survival, and patient-reported quality
of life [20-24]. Another planned prospective phase II study
(ACCLAIM) also aims to address this very issue with
concurrent molecular correlatives. Further investigation
into patient characteristics may reveal patterns of
recurrence that can facilitate patient selection for the most
appropriate preoperative chemotherapy. Furthermore,
molecular marker analysis may provide additional
information regarding the primary tumor, site of metastatic
disease or disease recurrence. We propose prospective
pulmonary metastasectomy trials incorporating such
selection may identify the subset of patients most likely
to benefit from multidisciplinary approach to pulmonary
oligometastatic disease.

Survival Rate and Statistical Analysis
We performed univariate and multivariate
analyses to determine the effect of the different classes
of chemotherapy regimen and various clinical variables
on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS). PFS is defined as time from date of intervention
for pulmonary metastases (which will be the date of
pulmonary metastasectomy surgery in the surgery alone
arm, and the date of start of preoperative chemotherapy
in the preoperative chemotherapy arm) to the date of first
documented recurrence at any location and OS is defined
as the time from the date of intervention for pulmonary
metastases (as defined above) to the date of death; patients
lost to follow-up or alive at the time of this analysis were
censored for the date of last contact.
The multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional
hazards model after backward stepwise Wald elimination
was conducted using the chemotherapy regimen and
clinical variables found to be significant on univariate
analysis, defined as a probability value of less than 0.25.
A p value of less than 0.05 on multivariate analysis was
considered significant. We used Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox
regression analysis and Mantel-Cox pairwise comparisons
to compare the PFS and OS among the groups of patients
receiving various chemotherapy regimens using the subset
of patient receiving an irinotecan-based regimen or the
surgery alone arm as the reference group as specified. All
analyses were conducted using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We queried a prospectively maintained thoracic

Cancer Center for patients with CRC who underwent their
first pulmonary metastasectomy at our institution from
January 1, 2000, to December 3, 2010. Eligibility criteria
included the presence of unilateral or bilateral resectable
lung lesions on preoperative CT scan of the chest without
local colorectal recurrence or distant extrahepatic disease;
the primary colorectal tumor was surgically removed
with an R0 resection; treatment-naïve to systemic
chemotherapy prior to lung resection. Prior resected or
patients who had surgically resectable hepatic metastases
were not excluded. Preoperative chemotherapy was
defined as chemotherapy delivered within the 3 months
before metastasectomy and not given in the adjuvant
setting after resection of their primary colonic lesion.
Patients were classified as having received a
