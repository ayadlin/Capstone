Abstract
We have shown previously that blockade of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) cooperates with a pan-selective
inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) in EGFR-driven
glioma. In this communication, we tested EGFR-driven glioma
differing in PTEN status, treating with the EGFR inhibitor
erlotinib and a novel dual inhibitor of PI3KA and mTOR
(PI-103). Erlotinib blocked proliferation only in PTEN wt cells
expressing EGFR. Although erlotinib monotherapy showed
little effect in PTEN mt glioma, PI-103 greatly augmented the
antiproliferative efficacy of erlotinib in this setting. To address
the importance of PI3K blockade, we showed in PTEN mt
glioma that combining PI-103 and erlotinib was superior to
either monotherapy or to therapy combining erlotinib with
either rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR) or PIK-90 (an inhibitor of PI3KA). These experiments show that a dual inhibitor
of PI3KA and mTOR augments the activity of EGFR blockade,
offering a mechanistic rationale for targeting EGFR, PI3KA,
and mTOR in the treatment of EGFR-driven, PTEN-mutant
glioma. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):7960–5]

Introduction
Both amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
and activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) feature prominently in glioma (1). Activation of PI3K that occurs as a
consequence of EGFR amplification should respond to inhibitors
of EGFR. PI3K may also be activated independently of EGFR
through gain-of-function mutations in PI3K or from inactivation of
the lipid phosphatase PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K (2–4).
Because the activation of PI3K is uncoupled from the upstream
amplification of EGFR in PTEN-mutant glioma, we previously
tested inhibitors of PI3K and of EGFR in combination, demonstrating the efficacy for this approach in EGFR-driven, PTENmutant glioma (5). The clinical relevance of this work was recently
corroborated. In two retrospective studies, tumors in which PI3K
was activated independently of EGFR responded poorly to EGFR
inhibition (6, 7). Collectively, these reports suggest that in tumors
with EGFR amplification and PTEN inactivation (comprising half

of EGFR-amplified glioma), combined inhibition of EGFR and PI3K
represents a promising therapy.
Toxicity associated with pan-selective inhibition of PI3Ks is a
major hurdle preventing the translation of this approach to
patients (8). To assess the impact of inhibiting individual PI3Ks,
we recently synthesized a series of isoform-selective inhibitors of
PI3Ks and enumerated their biochemical targets (9, 10). Using this
chemical array, we linked increased specificity to decreased toxicity
for agents targeting within the PI3K family and identified PI3Ka
as critical for proliferation in malignant glioma (11). We noted
particular efficacy in combining inhibitors of PI3Ka with inhibitors
of mTOR, a serine-threonine kinase complex critical for cell growth
(12). This result was at first somewhat surprising because mTOR
is activated in response to PI3K. PI3Ks activate the pleckstrin
homology domain containing serine-threonine kinase Akt. Akt, in
turn, signals through effectors, including mTOR, to promote
viability (13). Importantly, inhibitors of mTORC1 actually activate
signaling through PI3K (11, 14, 15). Thus, the efficacy of mTOR
blockade is achieved at the cost of driving other outputs of Akt
signaling, contributing to the overall disappointing results
observed using inhibitors of mTOR clinically. Combined blockade
of mTOR and PI3Ka shuts down mTOR and, in addition, abrogates
the activation of PI3K observed using mTOR inhibitors alone. We
recently validated this dual-inhibitor approach by combining
rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, with PIK-90, an inhibitor of
PI3Ka, and also through testing a dual inhibitor of PI3Ka and of
mTOR (PI-103) that was well tolerated and highly effective against
glioma xenografts (11).
These preclinical studies support the use of combination therapy
directed against EGFR and PI3K and, in parallel, show that
inhibitors of PI3Ka cooperate with inhibitors of mTOR in glioma.
The goal of our current work is to test inhibitors of EGFR in
combination with inhibitors of PI3Ka and mTOR. In this
communication, we show that PI-103 cooperates with erlotinib in
PTEN-mutant glioma, establishing a mechanistic rationale for
the blockade of EGFR, PI3Ka, and mTOR in the treatment of
EGFR-driven, PTEN mutant glioma.

Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry. For viability, 105 cells
were seeded in 12-well plates in the presence of erlotinib, PI-103, PIK-90,
rapamycin, erlotinib plus PIK-90, erlotinib plus rapamycin, erlotinib plus
PIK-90, and rapamycin or erlotinib plus PI-103 for 72 h. Cell viability was
determined using a WST-1 assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Flow
cytometry was as previously described (11).
Small interfering RNA transfection and retroviral infection.
Synthetic control small interfering RNA (siRNA) and siRNA against PTEN
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and transfected using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as previously described (16). pBabe puroL
PTEN plasmid 10785 was purchased from Addgene. To generate the
retrovirus, the packaging cell line 293T was cotransfected with plasmids
expressing gag/pol and VSVg, using Effectene-transfected reagent (Qiagen).
High-titer viruses were collected 48 h later and used to infect U87:EGFR
cells as previously described (16).
Immunoblot analysis. Membranes were blotted with antisera to p-Akt
(Ser473), Akt, p-Erk (Ser202/204), p-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236), and S6
ribosomal protein (Cell Signaling Technology), 4G10, h-tubulin (Upstate
Biotechnology), Erk2, or EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblotting
and detection were as previously described (11).

Results
PTEN status and efficacy: erlotinib versus PI-103. To clarify
the role of PTEN as a determinant of response to inhibitors of

EGFR/PI3K/mTOR signaling, we transduced EGFR into glioma
cell lines LN229 and U87 and treated these with erlotinib or
PI-103. In contrast to the PTEN mt cell line U87:EGFR , LN229:EGFR
cells (PTEN wt) showed a prominent response to erlotinib (Fig. 1A).
Flow-cytometric analysis showed G0-G1 arrest in LN229:EGFR
cells (Fig. 1B). In comparison, U87:EGFR cells showed little
response (Fig. 1B). These data are consistent with earlier studies
that PTEN status represents an important determinant of response
to EGFR inhibitors (6, 7).
Although mutation of PTEN would be expected to upregulate
PI3K, and downstream signaling through Akt to mTOR [and
subsequent feedback to PI3K (14–16)], we reasoned that PTEN
status would not affect the ability of PI-103, a potent inhibitor of both
PI3K and mTOR, to block the outputs of this signaling pathway
and induce cell cycle arrest. Consistent with this model, PI-103 was
equipotent against PTEN wt and PTEN mt cells, leading to arrest
at G0-G1 (Fig. 1A and B). The response to this compound contrasted
with the clear PTEN dependence observed using erlotinib and
suggests that PTEN status is not a critical determinant of response to
PI-103.
Erlotinib blocks mTOR in PTEN wt cells. To explore downstream targets mediating the response of glioma cells to EGFR

antiproliferative effects of the dual PI3

(PTEN wt) and U87:EGFR (PTEN mt) cells

inhibits signaling through Akt and mTOR in

Akt and mTOR irrespective of PTEN
status. LN229:EGFR (PTEN wt) and
U87:EGFR (PTEN mt) cells were treated
with erlotinib or PI-103 at dosages shown
for 24 h. EGF (50 ng/mL) was added
15 min before harvest, and lysates were
immunoblotted as indicated. Erlotinib
therapy led to decreased Erk signaling in
both cell lines, but impacted levels of p-Akt
and the mTOR target p-rpS6 kinase only
in cells wild-type for PTEN. Although
U87:EGFR cells had higher baseline
signaling through p-Akt, treatment with
PI-103 led to dose-dependent blockade of
both p-Akt and p-rpS6, without appreciably
impacting levels of p-Erk.

blockade, we did immunoblotting of PTEN wt and PTEN mt cells in
response to erlotinib using phosphospecific antibodies. Treatment
of cells with EGF led to equivalent responses in mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinase signaling irrespective of PTEN status, as
indicated by levels of p-Erk (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of EGFR impacted
p-Erk similarly in both cell lines, consistent with pathways linking
EGFR to MAP kinase signaling that were not impacted by PTEN
status (Fig. 1C). In contrast, although treatment with EGF led to
activation of p-Akt in PTEN wt cells, EGF showed little impact on
p-Akt in PTEN mt cells (Fig. 1C). PTEN mt cells had high levels of
p-Akt at baseline, consistent with the activation of PI3K through
the loss of PTEN. These high levels of p-Akt were only modestly
affected by the treatment of PTEN mt cells with erlotinib (Fig. 1C)
and stood in contrast to comparable experiments treating PTEN wt
cells with this compound (Fig. 1C), again supporting a model in
which the loss of PTEN effectively uncouples the activation of
PI3K/Akt from upstream signaling through EGFR.
To provide mechanistic insights with regard to molecular
alterations occurring as a result of PTEN mutation in combination
with EGFR overexpression, we did similar experiments in LN229
cells and U87 cells expressing endogenous levels of EGFR or
expressing the constitutively active tumor-derived EGFRvIII allele.
LN229 (PTEN wt) cells expressing endogenous levels of EGFR again
responded to erlotinib, whereas U87 (PTEN mt), cells were resistant
(Supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, cells transduced with
EGFRvIII were moderately resistant to erlotinib even in the setting
of wild-type PTEN (Supplemental Fig. S1A). EGFR blockade only

minimally impacted phosphorylation of both EGFRvIII and Akt
in LN229:EGFRvIII and U87:EGFRvIII cells (Supplemental Fig. S1B),
consistent with observations that the EGFRvIII allele is resistant to
tyrosine kinase inhibition (17).
To evaluate the response of mTOR signaling, we analyzed
the mTOR target ribosomal protein S6 kinase (rpS6). At baseline,
levels of p-rpS6 were prominent in both lines, apparently unaffected by PTEN status. In contrast, PTEN status was important
in determining whether the blockade of EGFR affected p-rpS6. In
PTEN wt cells, treatment with erlotinib led to decreased p-rpS6,
which changed in parallel with p-Akt (Fig. 1C). Importantly,
treatment of PTEN mt cells with erlotinib did not impact
p-rpS6, even at doses sufficiently high to block signaling through
p-Akt (Fig. 1C). These data show that PTEN links EGFR to
mTOR, that inhibition of EGFR can block signaling through
mTOR in PTEN wt but not in PTEN mt cells, and suggest that
blockade of mTOR correlates with the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors.
We next asked whether PTEN status was a determinant of the
biochemical response to PI-103. Both PTEN wt and PTEN mt cells
showed qualitatively similar blockade of p-Akt and p-rpS6 in
response to PI-103 (Fig. 1C), whereas levels of p-Erk were only
minimally affected. These experiments are consistent with results
in Fig. 1A and B, demonstrating that PI-103 was equipotent in
blocking proliferation in both PTEN wt and PTEN mt cells.
Erlotinib cooperates with PI-103 to arrest cells. Results in
Fig. 1 argue that mutation at PTEN uncouples EGFR from
downstream signaling through PI3K and mTOR, suggesting that

Combination Therapy in EGFR-Driven PTEN mt Glioma

the blockade of PI3K and/or mTOR could enhance the efficacy of
EGFR inhibition in PTEN mt glioma. To address the efficacy of this
combination with regard to molecular alterations occurring as a
result of PTEN mutation in combination with EGFR overexpression, we treated cells with erlotinib in combination with PI-103 in
the settings of endogenous levels of EGFR and in cells transduced
with either the tumor-derived EGFRvIII allele or with wild-type
EGFR in both LN229 PTEN wt and U87 PTEN mt cells (Fig. 2). As
expected, erlotinib led to G0-G1 arrest in PTEN wt LN229:vector cells
or LN229:EGFR cells and, with a 5-Amol/L dose, was minimally

augmented by PI-103 (Fig. 2A and C). In contrast, erlotinib with a
dose of 5 Amol/L had little impact as monotherapy in PTEN mt cells
and PTEN wt LN229:EGFRvIII cells. However, erlotinib did show
efficacy when combined with low-dose (100 nmol/L) PI-103 in this
setting, with combination therapy effectively promoting arrest at
G0-G1 (Fig. 2).
Immunoblotting experiments further reinforced results in Fig. 2,
demonstrating that PTEN status correlated with the ability of
erlotinib monotherapy to impact signaling through mTOR,
regardless of EGFR levels, and was consistent in cells transduced

Figure 3. PTEN status correlates with the ability of

against PTEN for 24 h and then treated with

by WST-1 assay, and levels of signaling molecules
were measured by Western blot. In comparison with

cells led to increased viability (left, fourth column ),
correlating with increased levels of p-Akt and p-rps6
(right, fifth lane ).

with wild-type EGFR and EGFRvIII (Fig. 3A–C). As monotherapy,
erlotinib could block signaling through mTOR most effectively in
PTEN wt cells. Addition of PI-103 to erlotinib in these cells further
blocked signaling through mTOR. In contrast, mutation at PTEN
was an important and negative determinant of erlotinib’s ability to
impact the activation of mTOR. Whereas treatment of PTEN mt cells
with erlotinib did not impact the mTOR target p-rpS6, addition of
PI-103 to erlotinib in these cells led to blockade of p-rpS6 (Fig. 3)
and effected arrest at G0-G1 (Fig. 2). These observations again
suggest a model in which PTEN status correlates with the ability of
EGFR inhibitors to impact signaling through mTOR and supports
combining PI-103 with erlotinib in EGFR-driven PTEN mt tumors.
To verify the importance of PTEN in mediating relative
sensitivity and resistance to erlotinib, we used siRNA to knock
down PTEN in PTEN wt cells (Fig. 3D). Knockdown of PTEN in
LN229:EGFR cells led to increased viability in the absence of
treatment and mediated relative resistance to erlotinib [45.1%
viability in LN229:EGFR cells treated with 5 Amol/L erlotinib
(Fig. 1A), compared with 77% viability with PTEN knockdown
(Fig. 3D)]. Immunoblotting revealed that erlotinib loses potency
against p-Akt and p-rpS6 as a result of PTEN knockdown (Fig. 3D).
We also transduced wild-type PTEN into PTEN mt U87:EGFR cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This manipulation led to decreased
viability in the absence of treatment and increased sensitivity to
erlotinib [84.2% viability in U87:EGFR cells treated with 5 Amol/L
erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S3A), compared with 55.3% viability
with transduced wild-type PTEN (Supplementary Fig. S2A)],
associated with more efficient blockade of p-Akt. Interestingly,
however, levels of p-rpS6 were unchanged (Supplementary
Fig. S2B), an observation also reported by others (18).
Blockade of EGFR, PI3KA, and mTOR in glioma. Having
shown that that PI-103 can augment the response to erlotinib in
PTEN mt cells, we next asked whether all three targets of these
agents (EGFR, PI3Ka, and mTOR) were critical to maximal
proliferative blockade. We treated PTEN mt U87:EGFR cells with
erlotinib in combination with the pure PI3Ka inhibitor PIK-90, the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, combination therapy using both PIK90 and rapamycin, or the dual PI3Ka/mTOR inhibitor PI-103
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We also treated PTEN mt U87:EGFRvIII
cells and did a comparable but more extensive analysis analyzing
each inhibitor individually and assessing the impact of paired
inhibitors, comparing erlotinib plus PI-103 to triple therapy using
erlotinib, rapamycin, and PIK-90 (Fig. 4). Measures of overall
viability and of proliferation were consistent, showing that
blockade of mTOR cooperated with inhibition of EGFR, and that
further blockade of PI3Ka led to maximal proliferation block (Fig. 4
compare column 7 to 8 or 9; Supplementary Fig. S3A, compare
columns 7 and 9, P < 0.0001 Student’s t test). Terminal nucleotidyl
transferase–mediated nick end labeling and sub-G1 fractions
showed no significant difference in apoptosis among these
therapies (data not shown).
Immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S3B)
were aligned with flow cytometry. Cooperative inhibition of EGFR
and of mTOR led to decreased levels of both p-EGFR and p-rpS6;
however, rapamycin actually increased levels of p-Akt (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Fig. S3B). Whereas erlotinib could efficiently block
p-EGFR (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S3B), combining erlotinib with
either PIK-90 or rapamycin blocked either p-Akt or p-rpS6 (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Fig. S3B). Further inhibition of PI3Ka was required
to simultaneously block p-Akt and p-rpS6 (Fig. 4, Supplementary
Fig. S3B). These results show that blockade of EGFR and of mTOR

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

cooperate in the treatment of EGFR-driven, PTEN mt glioma, and
that further efficacy can be achieved through concomitant
blockade of PI3Ka.

Discussion
The malignant gliomas show intrinsic resistance to most medical
therapies, contributing to their poor prognosis (1). The association of
EGFR amplification with high-grade glioblastoma multiforme
tumors therefore led to early optimism that EGFR inhibition would
be beneficial. This initial optimism was mitigated by observations
that only a subset of patients with EGFR-amplified glioma actually
responded to the blockade of EGFR (19). The failure of this approach
in the majority of patients could stem from inefficient blockade of
EGFR or from the inability to reverse signaling abnormalities
associated with EGFR amplification, even in the setting of adequate
blockade. Loss of PTEN contributes to this failure because loss of
PTEN blocks the ability of EGFR inhibitors to impact downstream
signaling through PI3K and mTOR.

Combination Therapy in EGFR-Driven PTEN mt Glioma

In this communication, we present a preclinical approach aimed
at reversing signaling abnormalities associated with EGFR amplification, offering a mechanistic rationale to combine inhibitors
of EGFR and of mTOR to effect proliferation blockade in patients
with EGFR-amplified, PTEN mt glioma. We showed the efficacy for
inhibitors of EGFR as monotherapy in glioma cells wild-type for
PTEN, and that the antiproliferative effect of EGFR inhibitors
correlated with the ability of these agents to impact levels of mTOR.
In contrast to PTEN wt cells, erlotinib treatment of PTEN mt cells
did not appreciably impact proliferation and specifically did not
impact mTOR, even when inhibitors of EGFR were used at doses
sufficiently high to block p-Akt (Fig. 1C). Although erlotinib had
little measurable activity as monotherapy in PTEN mt cells, erlotinib
clearly augmented the efficacy of PI-103 as measured both by
blockade of mTOR and of proliferation (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, the
ability of PI-103 and erlotinib to impact mTOR again was observed
in a setting where combination therapy did not appreciably alter
levels of p-Akt in comparison with PI-103 alone (Fig. 4). The
dissociation of Akt from mTOR in PTEN mt glioma has also been
observed by others (18) and suggests the presence of Aktindependent regulators of mTOR.
The failure of inhibitors of EGFR to impact mTOR signaling in
PTEN mt glioma also provides a rationale to combine inhibitors of
EGFR and mTOR. While targeting both kinases simultaneously led
to decreased proliferation in comparison with targeting either
EGFR or mTOR alone (Fig. 4), blockade of mTOR by rapamycin
actually led to increased levels of p-Akt (Fig. 4), a phenomenon
previously described by others (14, 15).

In response to the failure of EGFR inhibitors to block PI3K, Akt,
or mTOR in PTEN mt glioma, and because mTOR inhibitors actually
activate the PI3K/Akt axis, we tested inhibitors of EGFR and of
mTOR in combination with inhibitors of PI3Ka. The combinatorial
inhibition of three targets effectively blocked signaling and was
more effective than any two targeted therapies in combination as
measured both biochemically and through flow-cytometric analyses (Fig. 4). Even using approaches that blocked EGFR, PI3Ka, and
mTOR in combination, and in the setting of efficient inhibition of
Akt, an important mediator of antiapoptotic signaling (20), we
failed to observe any appreciable apoptosis in any glioma cell lines
tested. Thus, whereas the translation of our findings to patients
awaits clinical development of isoform-specific inhibitors of PI3K,
the ability to induce cytotoxic rather than cytostatic responses in
the malignant gliomas represents a more formidable challenge and
one that may be critical to the long-term efficacy of these
approaches in patients.
