Abstract
In this study, we investigated the mechanism of apoptosis
induction of obatoclax (GX15-070), a novel Bcl-2 homology
domain-3 (BH3) mimetic, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
cell lines and primary AML samples. Obatoclax inhibited
cell growth of HL-60, U937, OCI-AML3, and KG-1 cell lines.
Apoptosis induction contributed to the observed antiproliferative effects at concentrations of this agent that mirror its
affinity for antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. We show that obatoclax can promote the release of cytochrome c from isolated leukemia cell mitochondria and that apoptosis induced
by this agent is preceded by the release of Bak from Mcl-1,
liberation of Bim from both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and the
formation of an active Bak/Bax complex. Notably, apoptosis
was diminished, but not fully prevented, in the absence of
Bak/Bax or Bim, suggesting that obatoclax has additional
targets that contribute to its cytotoxicity. At growth inhibitory
doses that did not induce apoptosis or decrease viability,
obatoclax induced an S-G2 cell-cycle block. Obatoclax induced
apoptosis in AML CD34+ progenitor cells with an average IC50
of 3.59 F 1.23 Mmol/L although clonogenicity was inhibited
at concentrations of 75 to 100 nmol/L. Obatoclax synergized
with the novel BH3 mimetic ABT-737 to induce apoptosis in
OCI-AML3 cells and synergistically induced apoptosis in
combination with AraC in leukemic cell lines and in primary
AML samples. In conclusion, we show that obatoclax potently
induces apoptosis and decreases leukemia cell proliferation
and may be used in a novel therapeutic strategy for AML alone
and in combination with other targeted agents and chemotherapeutics. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3413–20]

Introduction
Induction of apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
is triggered by activation and oligomerization of the proapoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bak, which permeabilize the outer
mitochondrial membrane to release apoptogenic factors, like
cytochrome c, AIF, endoG, and omi/htra2 (1). For Bax and Bak to
oligomerize, they must first be liberated from antiapoptotic Bcl-2

family proteins and endogenous proteins that contain a conserved
dimerization motif termed Bcl-2 homology domain-3 (BH3), bind
to antiapoptotic Bcl-2-family members, and promote the release of
Bax and Bak (2). Notably, a recent report shows that antagonizing
the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that sequester Bax and Bak is
necessary and sufficient to induce apoptosis (3), explaining the
spectacular single-agent activity reported for the novel BH3
mimetic ABT-737 in lung cancer xenografts (4). Albeit ABT-737
potently antagonizes most antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins,
it does not antagonize Mcl-1, and we have shown accordingly
that in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells Mcl-1 confers complete
resistance to ABT-737–induced apoptosis (4, 5). Therefore, it is of
great interest to identify agents that can antagonize the antiapoptotic action of Mcl-1.
In this report, we investigate the activity of the novel BH3
mimetic obatoclax (GX15-070) in AML cell lines and primary
samples. Obatoclax has been reported to similarly antagonize all
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (average IC50, 3 Amol/L), including Mcl-1 (IC50, 2.9 Amol/L) and Bfl-1 (IC50, 5 Amol/L; ref. 6), and
the clinical formulation of this agent is currently being evaluated in
several phase I and phase II trials. We first sought to determine if
apoptosis contributed to the antiproliferative effects of obatoclax
and found that concentrations that antagonize Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, as
evidenced by the release of Bak and Bim, induced apoptosis by
activation of the intrinsic pathway. However, unlike observed for
ABT-737, apoptosis induced by this agent was only partially
dependent on Bak/Bax or Bim, suggesting that in cells treated
with obatoclax, targets (other than Bcl-2 proteins) contribute to its
cytotoxicity. Secondly, we identified that obatoclax can induce an
S-G2 cell cycle arrest that mediates its potent growth inhibitory
effects, suggesting that in addition to antagonizing antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins, the cycloprodigiosin structure of this agent may
have other targets. Lastly, we observed that obatoclax effectively
induced apoptosis of primary AML samples and found that this
was associated with release of Bim from Bcl-2. Our observations
support the therapeutic use of obatoclax alone and in combination
with AraC and ABT-737, and we propose that the liberation of Bim
from Bcl-2 may serve as a biomarker of activity of this agent.

antibody from Chemicon International, and goat anti-mouse and goat
anti-rabbit-horse radish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibodies from
Bio-Rad.
Cell lines and primary AML samples. U937, HL-60, and KG1 cells were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection. OCI-AML3 cells were
kindly provided by Mark Minden (Ontario Cancer Institute); Bak knockout
mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) by Anthony Letai (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute); and Bim knockout MEFs by Philippe Bouillet (Walter and Eliza
Hall Institute of Medical Research).
Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were obtained for in vitro
studies from patients diagnosed with AML during routine diagnostic
workup under informed consent in accordance with regulations and
protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board Committee of The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Mononuclear cells were
separated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma Chemical Co.) density-gradient
centrifugation. Cells were either used for colony assays, as described below,
or cultured in AIM-V medium (Life Technologies Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products), 1 mmol/L
L-glutamine (Life Technologies Laboratories), and 50 Ag/mL penicillin/
streptomycin (Life Technologies Laboratories).
Cell culture. U937, HL-60, KG1, and OCI-AML3 cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Inc.). MEF cells were cultured in DMEM (Mediatech,
Inc.). All media were supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mmol/L L-glutamine,
and 50 Ag/mL penicillin/streptomycin.
Leukemic cell lines and mononuclear cells from AML patients were
cultured at a density of 3.0  105 cells/mL in medium supplemented with
10% FBS and treated with either obatoclax or vehicle (DMSO final
concentration, 0.1%). Obatoclax was dissolved in DMSO to yield a stock of
10 mmol/L, which was diluted into the culture medium to the indicated
concentrations. In all experiments, cells were treated in log-phase growth.
Viability assay. The number of viable cells was assessed using a Vi-CELL
XR cell viability analyzer from Beckman Coulter at 72 h posttreatment.
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis. Apoptosis was determined by
the flow cytometric detection of phosphatidylserine externalization using
Annexin V APC (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells were washed twice with
binding buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES, 140 mmol/L NaCl, and 5 mmol/L CaCl2
(pH 7.4), all from Sigma Chemical Co.] and stained with APC-conjugated
Annexin V for 15 min at room temperature. Annexin V fluorescence was
determined with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur or LSRII flow cytometer.
Annexin V binds to those cells that express phosphatidylserine on the outer
layer of their membrane (7). Patient-derived cells from patient samples were
stained with PE-labeled anti-CD34 and Annexin V APC. The extent of
apoptosis was quantified as percentage of Annexin V–positive cells, and the
extent of drug-specific apoptosis was assessed by this formula: % specific
apoptosis = (test control)  100 / (100 control) (8).
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed at a density of 1  106/50 AL
in protein lysis buffer (0.25 mol/L Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate,
4% h-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) and heated
at 95jC for 10 min. The lysis buffer was supplemented with a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostic Co.). Cell lysates were then loaded onto
a 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, proteins were
transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech),
followed by immunoblotting. Signals were detected using a PhosphorImager
(Storm 860, version 4.0; Molecular Dynamics).
Coimmunoprecipitation. Cells (10  106) were washed with 1 PBS
and resuspended in ice-cold 1% CHAPS lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl,
10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% CHAPS and protease inhibitors (Roche)]
on ice for 30 min. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 4jC
for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. Protein A–coated 96-well strips (Pierce) were
washed thrice with CHAPS lysis buffer. For each 107 cells, 2.5 Ag of antibody
[Bcl-2/Bim co-IP, hamster anti-Bcl-2 antibody (BD); bak/bax co-IP,
mouse antibody specifically recognizing conformationally changed bak
(Calbiochem; ref. 9); Mcl-1/Bak/Bim co-IP, rabbit anti-Mcl-1 (Santa Cruz);
control, mouse, hamster, or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz)] was incubated in each
well in 100 AL CHAPS lysis buffer with shaking for 1 h at room temperature.
The strips were then washed thrice with CHAPS lysis buffer. The cell
extracts (10  106 cell equivalent) were added to the antibody-bound wells

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

and shaken overnight at 4jC. The wells were washed five times with CHAPS
lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized from the protein
A antibody wells with 2 SDS-PAGE sample buffer [0.25 mol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 4% h-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol
blue]. The samples were heated for 3 min by placing the well strip directly
on a 95jC heating block. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE gels,
which were then transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech) and detected by immunoblotting using rabbit antiBim (Calbiochem), mouse anti–Bcl-2 (Dako), rabbit anti-bak (Upstate),
rabbit anti-bax (BD), mouse anti-bak (Calbiochem), or mouse anti–Mcl-1
(BD) antibodies. Signals were detected using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860,
version 4.0; Molecular Dynamics).
Mitochondrial cytochrome c release. HL60 cells were grown in
T-175 flasks in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS to a cell density of
5  105 cells/mL. 1  108 cells were collected by centrifugation and washed
in 10 volumes of ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of icecold CEI buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA] and incubated on ice for 10 min. The swollen cell
suspension was homogenized by forcefully passing through a 24-G needle
six to eight times. One volume of cold CEII buffer (CEI buffer supplemented
with 170 mmol/L sucrose, 440 mmol/L mannitol) was added to the cell
suspension and gently mixed by inversion followed by centrifugation at 800
rpm for 5 min to collect nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was
then centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was washed twice in
cold CEII buffer. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 500 AL of M
buffer [125 mmol/L KCl, 20 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L Tris-Cl, 2 mmol/L
KPO4 (pH 7.2)] and maintained on ice. Protein was quantitated from 5 AL of
a 1:5 dilution using the bicinchoninic acid method. The purity of the
mitochondrial preparations was assessed by Western blot. Fractions were
immunoblotted with COXIV and GAPDH to determine the presence of
mitochondrial and cytosolic components, respectively (10). Using the above
methodology, cross-contamination of cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions
was not observed. Mitochondria were then resuspended in M buffer at
0.8 mg/mL protein and equilibrated at room temperature for 2 min before
the addition of obatoclax. The concentration of DMSO in the solution did
not exceed 0.2%. Mitochondrial suspensions were incubated for 15 min at
room temperature, and mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at
14,000 rpm for 5 min. The presence of cytochrome c was evaluated by
Western blotting of the mitochondrial pellet and the supernatant.
BrdUrd incorporation. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd ( final concentration, 10 Ag/mL) for 1 h at 37jC with 5% CO2. Cells were then washed and
fixed in cold ethanol. After treatment with Rnase, DNA was partially denatured
with 2N hydrochloric acid for 20 min. Anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences)
and appropriate secondary FITC-conjugated antibody were added. Counterstaining for total DNA content was performed using propidium iodide.
AML blast colony and colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage assays. AML bone marrow cells were isolated by gradient centrifugation and plated in duplicate at a density of 1 to 2  105 cells/mL in
1% methylcellulose in IMDM (Methocult; Stem Cell Technologies) containing 10% FBS and the following human recombinant growth factors:
erythropoietin (3 units/mL), interleukin 6 (IL-6; 10 ng/mL), IL-3 (10 ng/mL),
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (10 ng/mL), and stem
cell factor (50 ng/mL). Obatoclax was added at the start of cultures at
concentrations of 50 to 100 nmol/L. In four experiments, mononuclear cells
isolated from normal bone marrow (1  104 cells/mL) were plated, as
described above. The colony-forming capacity of AML and normal samples
was evaluated under a stereo or inverted microscope after 8 to 10 d of
culture at 37jC in a 5% CO2 humidified environment. A colony was defined
as a cluster of 40 or more cells [blasts (colony-forming unit, CFU) or
erythrocyte (blast-forming unit), granulocyte, monocyte (CFU-GM), or the
mixed population (CFU-GEMM)].
Small interfering RNA transfection. Silencing of Bim and Bak gene
expression in leukemic cells was achieved by the small interfering RNA
(siRNA) technique. siRNAs were obtained as duplexes in purified and
desalted form (option C) from Dharmacon. The sense strand of the siRNA
silencing bim gene (Bim-siRNA) was GACCGAGAAGGUAGACAAUUGdTdT.
Bak ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool (L-003305-00) was purchased from

Dharmacon. Nonspecific control pool containing four pooled nonspecific
siRNA duplexes was also used as a negative control (called NS-siRNA,
Dharmacon-Upstate). Transfection of leukemic cells was carried out
by electroporation using the Nucleofection system (Amaxa) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2  106 cells were resuspended in
100 AL of T-cell nucleofector solution containing 4,000 nmol/L of doublestranded siRNAs. After electroporation, 500 AL of cultured medium were
added to the cuvette, and the cells were transferred into culture plates
containing 1.5 mL prewarmed culture medium (siRNA final concentration,
67 nmol/L).
Statistics. Results are expressed as means F SE of two to three replicates
unless otherwise indicated. Synergism, additive effects, and antagonism
were assessed with the Chou-Talay method (11) and Calcusyn software
(Biosoft); the combination index (CI) for each experimental combination
was calculated. When CI = 1, the equation represents the conservation
isobologram and indicates additive effects. CI values of <1.0 indicate an
additive effect characteristic of synergism.

Results
Obatoclax induces apoptosis in AML cell lines. Obatoclax is a
novel cycloprodigiosin-derived small molecule BH3 inhibitor that
binds with moderate affinity to all antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members, including Mcl-1, and is currently undergoing phase I
clinical trials in leukemias (12). To evaluate the antileukemia effects of obatoclax, we incubated OCI-AML3 AML cells with various
concentrations of obatoclax (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 Amol/L) and
measured the number of viable cells using a Vi-CELL XR cell viability
analyzer (Fig. 1A). Our results suggested that obatoclax effectively
abrogated the growth of OCI-AML3 cells, and similar results were
seen in HL60, KG1, and U937 cells (not shown). To then determine if
apoptosis contributes to the antiproliferative effect of GX15-070,

OCI-AML3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of this
agent for various times, and phosphatydil serine externalization was
monitored by flow cytometry by staining with Annexin V–APC. As
shown in Fig. 1B, GX15-070 induced a time-dependent and dosedependent externalization of phosphatydil serine that was detected
as early as 24 hours after exposure and at doses that paralleled the
reported IC50 values (1.1–5.0 Amol/L) for antagonism of Bcl-2 family
proteins (6). Interestingly, obatoclax also displayed low-dose
antiproliferative properties that were accompanied by an S-G2 cell
cycle block as shown by an increase in BrdUrd-labeled S-phase cells
concomitant with the disappearance of cells in G2-M cell cycle phase,
as well as an increase in cell size as determined by the Coulter ViCell
XR analyzer (Fig. 1C). To investigate if the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of obatoclax could be differentiated pharmacokinetically, we performed a washout experiment (Fig. 1D). The
results show that wash out of obatoclax after 1-hour exposure
prevents the induction of apoptosis (right) but does not prevent
the observed growth inhibitory effects (left), suggesting that the
targets that mediate apoptosis are different from those mediating
mitotic arrest. Nonetheless, our observations suggest that, at
concentrations of obatoclax that display affinity for antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins, apoptosis contributes to the observed antiproliferative effects. Similar results were also found in HL-60 cells (data not
shown).
Obatoclax-induced apoptosis proceeds through the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway after neutralization of Mcl-1. We have
previously reported that the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 promotes
the release of cytochrome c from isolated HL60 mitochondria (5).
To investigate if obatoclax could exert similar effects, we exposed
succinate/rotenone-energized HL60 mitochondria to obatoclax

(10 Amol/L) for 15 minutes followed by a cold-centrifugation step
and assessed the levels of cytochrome c in the pellet and
corresponding supernatant. As shown in Fig. 2A, obatoclax
promotes the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria,
suggesting that, like ABT-737, this agent induces apoptosis through
activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Similar results were
obtained with U937 cell mitochondria (not shown). We then
investigated if obatoclax-induced activation of the intrinsic
pathway involved the release of Bak from the potent antiapoptotic
protein Mcl-1, a protein that we have previously reported mediates
resistance to ABT-737 (5). Treatment of OCI-AML3 cells with
obatoclax resulted in a rapid and complete release of Bak from
Mcl-1 (Fig. 2B), and this was accompanied by increased expression
of a conformationally altered Bak in a complex with Bax (Fig. 2C;
ref. 9). Additionally, it was observed that obatoclax-induced
apoptosis was decreased, but not completely abolished, in Bak /
cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting that Bak contributes to some extent to
cytotoxicity induced by this agent. No further protection from cell
death was seen in Bax/Bak / MEFs (not shown). Finally, we
sought to determine if, similar to ABT-737–induced apoptosis,
obatoclax-induced apoptosis proceeded in a Bim-independent
manner in leukemia cells. We observed that Bim was efficiently
released from Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in OCI-AML3 cells treated with
obatoclax (Fig. 3A and B), and most interestingly, cells devoid of
Bim expression were less susceptible to apoptosis induction by this
BH3 mimetic (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that cells treated with
obatoclax-free Bim may cooperate with Bak to promote the
activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Indeed, partial
knockdown of both Bim and Bak by siRNA in HL-60 cells partially
protected cells from apoptosis (Fig. 3D), whereas cells electro-

porated with Bak or Bim siRNA alone were minimally protected.
Although we were unable to achieve complete knockdown in
notoriously difficult-to-transfect leukemic cells, these data suggest
other targets contributing to proapoptotic effects of this agent. In
contrast, cell cycle analysis of wild-type, Bax-deficient, Bakdeficient, Bax/Bak-deficient, or Bim-deficient MEFs showed that
obatoclax triggered an S-G2 cell cycle block irrespective of the
status of these proteins (data not shown).
Obatoclax synergizes with AraC and ABT-737 in inducing
apoptosis in AML cell lines. Because the binding affinities of
obatoclax to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are different than those
of ABT-737 and each agent binds to a different but overlapping
region of the hydrophobic pocket of Bcl-2, we sought to investigate
if the combination of both BH3 mimetics could synergistically
activate apoptosis. Briefly, ABT-737–resistant OCI-AML3 cells were
treated simultaneously with ABT-737 and obatoclax using a fixed
ratio (1:1) and Annexin V positivity was monitored by flow cytometry after 48 hours. Isobologram analysis (Fig. 4A) revealed that
obatoclax and ABT-737 act synergistically in inducing apoptosis
(averaged CI values, 0.3 F 0.03) suggesting that indeed the combination of two BH3 mimetics with different binding characteristics promotes a greater degree of apoptosis than each agent
alone. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4B, obatoclax also synergized
with AraC, a frontline chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of
AML, to induce apoptosis in OCI-AML3 cells ( fixed 1:1 ratio;
averaged CI, 0.36 F 0.04). Finally, pretreatment with AraC for
24 hours or pretreatment of obatoclax for 24 hours did not significantly alter the average CI values for 48-hour combination
treatment with these agents, suggesting the schedule independence
of their interaction (Supplementary Table S1). Similar results were

by flow cytometry as described in Materials
and Methods.

observed in HL60 cells, as well as in a primary AML sample, with
averaged CI values for apoptosis induction of 0.062 and 0.43,
respectively. These results suggest that, like other BH3 mimetics
(5, 13, 14), obatoclax can potentiate the effects of traditional
chemotherapy and may offer a therapeutic advantage in combination with other targeted agents.
Obatoclax induces apoptosis and selectively inhibits colony
formation of primary AML cells. To determine the effects of
obatoclax on AML progenitor cells, primary AML samples were

treated with increasing concentrations of obatoclax, and Annexin V
was measured in the CD34-positive compartment by flow cytometry after 24 hours (Fig. 5A). All samples were obtained from
untreated (newly diagnosed) or relapsed AML patients (Table 1A).
Specific apoptosis was induced at 250 nmol/L obatoclax (16.04 F
4.79%) and increased in a dose-dependent manner up to the
highest dose tested (10 Amol/L, 73.48 F 8.39%; Supplementary
Table S2). The average IC50 for the seven AML patient samples
tested was 3.59 F 1.23 Amol/L. Additionally, albeit Mcl-1 expression

potential of normal bone marrow samples treated with obatoclax was determined as above. D, Bcl-2 was immunoprecipitated from a primary AML sample treated
with obatoclax, and the presence of Bim was assessed by Western blot. Results are representative of three independent samples examined.

was very low in the primary samples examined, obatoclax was able
to efficiently dissociate Bim from Bcl-2 in all three primary samples
tested (Fig. 5D), suggesting that cell death induced by this agent in
AML is associated with antagonism of Bcl-2. Furthermore, we
investigated the effects of obatoclax on the clonogenicity of
untreated or relapsed primary AML samples (Table 1B) in the CFU
blast assay. The formation of surviving AML progenitor colonies
was reduced to 77.33 F 8.41% at 75 nmol/L and 58.45 F 10.63% at
100 nmol/L (Fig. 5B). Colony inhibition in normal bone marrow
was only reduced to 98.00 F 3.22% at 75 nmol/L and 80.63 F
18.88% at 100 nmol/L (Fig. 5C). The average IC50 for obatoclax
in AML was 0.18 F 0.07 Amol/L and for normal bone marrow was
0.44 F 0.22 Amol/L.

Discussion
The development of BH3 mimetics has offered a novel
therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer (15). We have
previously reported that the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 efficiently
induces cell death in AML cell lines and primary samples and
preferentially targets AML progenitor cells. ABT-737 binds with
high affinity to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, but not to Mcl-1 or A1, and
as such, it is ineffective in promoting cell death in cells that express
Mcl-1, like OCI-AML3 cells. Albeit we observed that in certain cell
contexts the expression of Mcl-1 can be diminished by pharma-

cologic inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway, resulting in sensitization to apoptosis induction by ABT737, we are concerned that in certain cancer cells Mcl-1 expression
may be independent of MAPK and therefore cannot be downregulated by MAPK inhibitors. These cancer cell contexts will
require the use of BH3 mimetics that can efficiently target Mcl-1 for
therapeutic benefit. Additionally, from a mechanistic standpoint,
investigating how direct Mcl-1 antagonism modulates apoptosis in
leukemia cells, alone or in combination with other therapeutic
approaches, is of utmost importance for the development of novel
therapeutic approaches.
Here, we report that obatoclax (GX070-15), a BH3 mimetic
currently in clinical trials that displays a different binding affinity
than that of ABT-737 to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, is
effective in inducing apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary
samples. Like ABT-737, obatoclax induced apoptosis in a timedependent and dose-dependent manner and apoptosis induction
occurred at doses that reflected the affinity of this agent for Bcl-2
family proteins. Mechanistically, apoptosis induction by obatoclax
was preceded by liberation of Bak from Mcl-1, dissociation of Bim
from Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and the formation of a complex of
conformationally altered Bak, previously reported to promote
apoptosis (9), with Bax. Interestingly, the Bax and Bak complex
formation induced by obatoclax has also been observed in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with refractory

chronic lymphocytic leukemia within a single agent phase I trial.
Unlike observed for ABT-737, apoptosis induced by obatoclax was
diminished, but not abolished, in the absence of Bak/Bax, suggesting that additional target(s) other than Bcl-2 contribute to the
activation of the intrinsic pathway by this cycloprodigiosin
derivative. In addition, we identified that obatoclax can abolish

cell growth independently of apoptosis by inducing a S-G2 cell cycle
block. This antiproliferative effect could be temporally separated
from the proapoptotic effects of obatoclax in washout experiments
and occurred in the absence of Bax/Bak/Bim proteins, suggesting
that this agent has multiple targets. Nevertheless, the abolishment
of clonogenicity of primary AML samples treated with low doses of

obatoclax strongly suggests that the Bcl-2–independent targets of
this agent may have clinical applicability. The mechanisms of these
antiproliferative effects of obatoclax require further studies which
are outside of the scope of this manuscript.
From a therapeutic standpoint, we observed that obatoclax
could potentiate the activity of AraC, and most interestingly, we
found that this agent synergized with ABT-737 to induce apoptosis.
These findings suggest that this agent may not only augment the
clinical activity of traditional chemotherapy, but it can potentiate
the activity of other BH3 mimetics with different binding affinities/
patterns. Interestingly, a recent report showed that DNA-damaging
agents synergized with ABT-737 in killing of lung cancer cells via,
in part, increased expression of Bim (16), suggesting that the
observed synergy of obatoclax with ABT-737 may be mediated not
just by liberation of Bak from Mcl-1, but amplified by the near-

complete release of Bim from Mcl-1. In addition, we observed that
in primary samples obatoclax-induced apoptosis was associated
with liberation of Bim from Bcl-2, suggesting the potential utility of
this observation as a biomarker of activity in clinical trials with
this agent. We propose that the combinatorial use of obatoclax
with chemotherapy and/or ABT-737 may offer a superior
therapeutic benefit for AML patients via modulation of the
apoptotic rheostat.
