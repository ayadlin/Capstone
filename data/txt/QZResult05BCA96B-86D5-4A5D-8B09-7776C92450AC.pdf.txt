BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation is increasingly advocated as primary surgical therapy for children with hepatoblastoma involving 3 or 4 sectors of the liver after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This study evaluated the results of
nontransplant hepatectomy in children who might otherwise have been considered for liver transplantation.
METHODS: All children who underwent resection at a single institution from 1998 to 2009 for POST-TEXT IV or centrally located POST-TEXT III hepatoblastoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were reviewed. RESULTS: Fourteen
children (7 boys) with a median age of 8 months at diagnosis met study criteria. Pulmonary metastases in 3 patients
were resected in 2 and resolved with chemotherapy in 1 patient. Preoperative grouping after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was POST-TEXT IV in 3 patients and POST-TEXT III in 11 patients. Thirteen of 14 (93%) children who underwent
aggressive resection despite being potential candidates for primary transplantation were alive and tumor-free with a
median follow-up of 57 months. Observed survival rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 93%, 91%, and 88% respectively.
Event-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 93%, 91%, and 75%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent survival
(93%) was obtained with aggressive resection in children with POST-TEXT III and IV hepatoblastoma meeting criteria
for transplant referral. The 1 death occurred in a patient with unfavorable small cell histology. These children should
be managed at institutions experienced in both advanced pediatric hepatobiliary surgery and transplantation. Operative exploration was frequently required to ultimately determine which tumors can be resected and which require

Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary liver neoplasm in children, accounting for 28% of all liver
tumors and 66% of malignant liver neoplasms in the pediatric and adolescent populations.1,2 More than two-thirds of
cases occur in children less than 2 years of age, and hepatoblastoma accounts for >90% of malignant liver tumors in this
age group.2 The incidence of hepatoblastoma has increased in recent years and a correlation with very low birth weight has
been reported.3-5
The survival rate for children with hepatoblastoma has increased to greater than 75% in recent years, largely due to
the introduction of cisplatin-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens.6-9 Preoperative chemotherapy allows many
initially unresectable tumors to be safely removed.10,11 For those children with disease contained to the liver that is
deemed unresectable after a predetermined course of chemotherapy, liver transplantation is the only option. Long-term
survival of 80% to 90% has been reported in children with unresectable hepatoblastoma who undergo primary transplantation.12-14
The excellent results of primary liver transplantation for unresectable hepatoblastoma, in contrast to the poor outcomes reported in children requiring rescue transplant for recurrence after a primary resection, have led some to advocate
for the expanded use of primary transplantation.13,15 In the current Children’s Oncology Group (COG) hepatoblastoma
protocol (AHEP0731), tumor extent is determined from computed tomography (CT) imaging using the PRETreatment
EXTent of disease (PRETEXT) system, which is now referred to as POST-TEXT for studies obtained after treatment
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Children with POST-TEXT III and IV tumors are referred to a surgical center with expertise in pediatric liver transplant and extreme liver resection at diagnosis if possible and no later than just after the second

cycle of chemotherapy. This algorithm is designed to prevent protracted courses of chemotherapy and ensure expeditious access to transplant for truly unresectable tumors.
However, the PRETEXT/POST-TEXT system is known
to overstage in up to 37% of cases, and operative exploration is frequently needed to make an ultimate determination of resectability. We hypothesized that excellent
oncologic cure, compatible with that reported for primary
transplantation, is possible with nontransplant resection
in appropriately selected children with POST-TEXT III
and IV hepatoblastoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All patients treated for hepatoblastoma at our hospital
from 1998 through 2009 were retrospectively reviewed.
The study was approved by the hospital’s Institutional
Review Board. Pretreatment Extent of Disease (PRETEXT)16 grouping at the time of diagnosis was retrospectively determined from CT images by the senior author
(R.S.) and by a pediatric radiologist (T.B.) who was
blinded to the clinical outcomes of the patients. Due to
the referral nature of our practice, computed tomography
(CT) images from the time of initial diagnosis were not
available for all patients. POST-TEXT grouping after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and before surgery was determined in all patients using the same protocol. Patients
with POST-TEXT I and II tumors, and those with
POST-TEXT III tumors not involving the main portal
vein or its bifurcation, the hepatic vein confluence, or the
inferior vena cava (IVC) were excluded because transplant
evaluation is not generally warranted in these patients.
The medical records of these patients with these
POST-TEXT III and IV tumors were retrospectively analyzed. Variables studied included age at diagnosis, age at
operation, gender, neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, a-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, type of operation, histology, and clinical outcomes. The primary
outcomes were overall and event-free survival after tumor
resection.
Many of the patients were referred from another
institution for consideration of transplantation versus
extreme resection. All patients had CT imaging of the
chest to exclude metastatic disease, and those with persistent pulmonary metastasis after neoadjuvant therapy
underwent thoracotomy before liver resection. Most families were prepared for the possibility of living or deceased
donor transplantation in the event that, upon exploration,
the tumor proved unresectable without compromising the

viability of the remaining liver, or if liver function became
irrecoverably compromised after resection.
Standard hepatic trisectionectomy was performed
when feasible, but nonanatomic resections were performed as needed. Nontypical operative techniques
included mesohepatectomy (aka central hepatectomy), as
well as shaving a margin or performing a separate wedge
resection from the remaining sector of liver. In most cases,
the tumor could be dissected free of the remaining portal
vein branch or hepatic vein. If the abutting tumor was
truly adherent, an ultrasonic dissection device was used to
clear residual hepatocytes from the remaining vessel. All
resections were performed by a single, experienced pediatric hepatobiliary surgeon who has performed well over
100 pediatric liver resections.

RESULTS
Twenty-three children with POST-TEXT III and IV
tumors were managed at our institution between 1998
and 2009. Tumors in 8 children remained unresectable
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and they underwent primary liver transplantation.12 These 8 children all underwent operative exploration before being listed for
transplant. One child had ongoing metastatic disease after
chemotherapy and was not considered a transplant candidate. The remaining 14 children underwent aggressive
resection despite being potential liver transplant candidates and constitute our series population (Table 1). Nine
(64%) were referred from another institution for transplant evaluation or extreme resection. The median age at
diagnosis was 8 months. Ten (71%) were less than 2 years
of age. Seven (50%) were male. Mean serum AFP at diagnosis was 440,670  373,309 ng/ml. All patients received
cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Mean AFP
decreased to 9,969  21,212 ng/ml after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.
Three patients were COG stage IV and 11 were
COG stage III. All 3 patients with stage IV disease had
pulmonary metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Metastatic
disease resolved with chemotherapy in 1 patient and was
resected in 2 patients. One additional patient had direct
extension into the right atrium that was resected under
cardiopulmonary bypass at the time of partial
hepatectomy.
Primary liver transplantation may have been considered as an alternative to aggressive resection in these
patients for the following reasons: 1) ongoing involvement of all 4 liver sectors (POST-TEXT IV) in 3 patients

had a positive atrial margin. Further adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 9 of 13 patients (unknown in 1).

well 30 months after his second operation. Observed survival rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 93%, 91%, and 88%
respectively. Event-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 5 years
were 93%, 91%, and 75%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
We report 93% survival after nontransplant resection in
children with POST-TEXT IV and centrally located
POST-TEXT III tumors who might have otherwise been
considered for primary transplantation. The 1 child who
died had unfavorable small cell undifferentiated histology
and may have done equally poorly with transplantation.
Our results compare favorably with the 79% event-free
survival reported for COG stage III and IV tumors that
are completely resected17 and 82% overall survival for
patients undergoing primary liver transplant for POSTTEXT III and IV tumors.18
Liver transplantation plays an essential role in the
management algorithm of children with large and multifocal hepatoblastoma. During this study period, 8 children at our institution underwent primary liver transplant

1980

for unresectable hepatoblastoma with 88% survival.12
Long-term survival of 80% to 90% in children with
POST-TEXT III and IV hepatoblastoma undergoing primary transplant has been similarly reported from several
institutions around the world.13,14,19 Three-year survival
in patients with bilobar disease undergoing transplant
approaches that achieved in patients with standard risk
tumors managed by straightforward resection.13 Accordingly, protracted courses of chemotherapy, with the intention of making unresectable tumors resectable, as well as
hazardous attempts at resection are now avoided in
patients who are candidates for transplantation.13,20
Despite the oncologic success of liver transplantation for POST-TEXT III and IV tumors, transplantation
is not without incumbent morbidity and mortality. If
equivalent long-term disease-free survival were achievable
with partial hepatectomy for a subset of these patients,
this latter approach would be preferable. Recommendations for primary transplant in all patients with POSTTEXT IV or centrally located POST-TEXT III disease
are based on indirect and hypothetical evidence
only.13,15,18,21 Proponents of this approach cite 1) the

universally poor outcomes that have been reported in
patients requiring rescue transplant for disease recurrence
after resection, 2) the risk of macroscopic residual disease
after radical nonanatomic resections, 3) the potential hazards of microscopic residual disease when centrally located
tumors are dissected off main hilar structures, and 4) the
possibility of viable tumor cells in sections of the liver that
appear to have been cleared of disease by preoperative
chemotherapy.13-15,18,21 Although the outcomes of rescue
transplant for recurrent disease after resection have been
poor, with most series reporting 20% to 30% survival,12,13 it is unknown how often and in what patients
this scenario occurs. Although inferior outcomes in
patients who received nonanatomic liver resections were
reported in 1 study, 17% of patients in this study had
incomplete tumor resection.8 Complete macroscopic tumor resection must be achieved.22,23 Whether it is accomplished with total hepatectomy and transplant, anatomic
partial hepatectomy, or nonanatomic resection may not
matter. The need for microscopically negative margins
may be less rigid. Although inconclusive, existing evidence
does not link microscopic residual disease with tumor re-

currence or death.22,24 For patients with central tumors
that are dissected off main hilar structures, postoperative
chemotherapy may be sufficient to destroy any remaining
tumor cells adherent to these central vessels. Finally, the
management of patients with multifocal tumors where
chemotherapy clears 1 or more sections of the liver of
macroscopic tumor is challenging. Given the success of
cisplatin-based chemotherapy at abolishing small pulmonary metastases and downsizing large multifocal tumors
to render them resectable, it is possible that these patients
do not all require transplant.10,25,26 Our experience would
suggest that this course of action is successful and therefore warranted in many cases, although it must be carefully considered on a case by case basis both by direct
inspection of the liver and possible biopsy at the time of
primary resection.
A structured surgical management algorithm for
children with POST-TEXT III and IV hepatoblastoma is
needed to help maximize survival while minimizing
unnecessary long-term morbidity. Expeditious referral to
a center with expertise in both pediatric liver transplantation and extreme resection is of paramount importance.

Evaluation by a surgeon experienced in both operative
options is key to ensuring that 1) transplantation is performed early, when indicated, to avoid the long-term toxicities related to extra cycles of chemotherapy and the poor
prognosis inherent in rescue transplant for recurrent
tumors; while 2) avoiding the long-term morbidity of transplant in patients who can be safely resected. Within these
specialized centers, management should be guided by postchemotherapy imaging while recognizing that the PRETEXT system overstages up to 40% of patients.27 POSTTEXT III tumors that clearly spare at least 1 branch of the
portal vein and 1 hepatic vein will almost always prove resectable. At the other extreme, when imaging clearly demonstrates significant multifocal disease in all 4 sectors of the
liver, or when there is definite venous obstruction, encasement, and /or invasion of the main portal vein or bifurcation (P2) or the IVC or all 3 hepatic veins (V3), then the
tumor is truly unresectable and requires transplantation.16
More commonly, however, there will be uncertainty as to
whether the tumor truly involves, or merely abuts, the
remaining portal venous branch, hepatic vein, or liver sector. Abdominal exploration is essential for children falling
in this gray zone to ultimately determine if the tumor is resectable or requires transplantation.
Our study is limited by the retrospective design and
the referral nature of our surgical practice. Preoperative
and postoperative care was not standardized, and frequently managed at other institutions. Nonetheless, this
series demonstrates that excellent results are possible with
extreme resections for hepatoblastoma when performed
by an experienced pediatric hepatobiliary surgeon. The
findings justify further investigation into the optimal surgical management for children with large and centrally
located tumors.
In conclusion, both liver transplantation and
aggressive nontransplant resection have important roles
in the surgical management of children with hepatoblastoma that involves all 4 sectors of the liver or main
vascular structures after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Referral to institutions with expertise in both pediatric
transplantation and hepatobiliary surgery is essential.
Preoperative imaging will clearly identify some tumors
as unresectable, but the PRETEXT/POST-TEXT system tends to overstage and there is no substitute for
operative exploration to make an ultimate determination of resectability. The ongoing challenge for surgeons treating these children is to provide the best
oncologic therapy for each individual child while limiting unnecessary long-term morbidity.
