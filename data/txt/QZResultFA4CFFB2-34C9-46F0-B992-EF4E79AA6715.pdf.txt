ABSTRACT
Specific overexpression in cancer cells and evidence of oncogenic functions make
Survivin an attractive target in cancer therapy. The small molecule compound YM155
has been described as the first “Survivin suppressant” but molecular mechanisms
involved in its biological activity and its clinical potential remain obscure. We herein
show that YM155 exerts single agent toxicity on primary breast cancer cells grown
in an ex vivo assay preserving tumor microenvironment. In vitro assays indicate that
YM155 more efficiently triggers cell death in breast cancer cells (including these with
stem-cell like properties) than in non tumorigenic mammary cells. YM155-induced cell
death is critically dependent on autophagy and NF-kB but independent of p53 and it
coïncides with DNA damage and a DNA damage response in p53-proficient cells. Our
results point out a crosstalk between NF-kB and autophagy controlling YM155-induced
death in breast cancer cells and argue for the potential use of YM155 as a genotoxic
agent in breast cancer therapy.

trials for various kinds of cancers which validates its
safety [reviewed in 2]. These revealed a modest anticancer
activity as a single agent and trials in combination with
paclitaxel and carboplatin in solid tumors are now
ongoing. It is thus of importance to evaluate YM155
activity against specific types of cancers and to define
more accurately how it may exert its effect on cancer cells.
This is apposite as recent studies suggest that suppressing
Survivin expression was not the main target of YM155
in cancer cells. In addition, the exact modes of cell death
induced by YM155 remain essentially uncharacterized.
Tight regulation of both NF-κB pathway and
autophagy process is necessary for maintenance of
cellular homeostasis. In cancer cells, deregulation of both
pathways is frequently observed and is associated with
tumorigenesis and tumor cell resistance to cancer therapies
[4, 5]. Importantly, both are induced under cellular stress
and ensure homeostatic responses in controlling each other
through positive or negative feedback loops. Autophagy,
that is a self-degradative process recycling cytoplasmic

INTRODUCTION
Survivin gene, i.e BIRC5, expression is upregulated
in many human tumors and this correlates with metastatic
spread, tumor invasiness, and poor prognosis associated
with treatment resistance. While its role in restricting
the execution of cell death has not been fully resolved,
it is clear that Survivin participates in cell cycle control
especially during mitotic spindle checkpoint and
cytokinesis. In addition, its barely detectable levels in
normal adult tissues makes Survivin an attractive target
for pharmacological intervention in cancer therapy [1, 2].
YM155 was the first drug reported to block Survivin
expression [3]. This small imidazolium compound was
initially identified from a phamacological screen based on
BIRC5 promoter inhibition and described as a first in class
“Survivin suppressant”. YM155 has been demonstrated to
exert antitumor activity, to suppress Survivin expression
and to induce tumor cell apoptosis, in various human
cancer models. It has already completed phase 2 clinical

components through autophagosomes formation and their
fusion with lysosomes, generally acts as an energy sensor
and protects cell integrity but when unfavorable conditions
persist, it may act as a cell death pathway. Its role in
cancer is dual from tumor-suppressive activity in early
oncogenesis to contribution to drug resistance in advanced
cancer [6, 7, 8]. NF-kB pathway also interplays in cancer
cells’ survival control and its activation constitutes a
rapidly inducible first line of defence against cellular stress
and have important role in resistance to cancer therapies
[5, 9]. Of note, apoptosis is a main cell death program
triggered by chemotherapy treatments [10] and many
molecular links between this biochemically well-defined
executive process and autophagy or NF-kB pathway
have been reported. Apoptosis involves the Bcl-2 family
proteins as major regulators of the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway and/or the TNF-R family in the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway. It relies on a proteolytic caspase-dependent
cascade, to demantle cells and endow them with specific
morphological characteristics [11, 12]. Importantly, under
stressfull conditions such as treatment using chemotherapy,
an intricate interplay between the homeostatic pathways
NF-kB and autophagy and the apoptotic executive process
may take place in cancer cells that will ultimately dictate
their fate between cell death or survival. Identifying how
innovative anticancer agents exert their effect at cellular
level is of major importance in anticipating their efficacy
in cancer or relevant synergistic combinations.
In this study, we have evaluated the antitumor
activity of the small-molecule Survivin suppressant,
YM155 in a relevant preclinical model of breast cancers
and explored the signalling pathways on which its activity
relied. We provide the first evidence that YM155 triggered
cell death in primary breast cancer cells embedded in their
environnement in a majority of human breast tumors.
Interestingly, we also report that among mammary
cells, the transformed and the cancer-initiating cells
are preferentially targeted by YM155. Consistent with
previous reports, we further observe that the autophagy
process delineates YM155-induced cell death in a p53independent way despite DNA damage occurence, but
we also demonstrate that the canonical NF-kB pathway
potently controls YM155-induced cell death, upstream
the autophagy process. Overall, our results point out for
the first time that YM155 induces cell death in primary
human breast cancer cells and that a NF-kB and autophagy
network controls its activity.

RESULTS

embedded in their microenvironment, is properly preserved
[15] and we began this study by examining the response
of 19 breast tumors to YM155 using this assay in order to
evaluate its clinical potential. Briefly, fresh tumors were
rapidly cut in thin slices and incubated in full medium alone
or with 50 nM YM155 for 48 h. Tumor slices were then
paraffin-embedded and analyzed for morphologic integrity
by HES staining and active caspase-3 expression, as a
marker of cell death response (apoptosis more particularly),
by standard immunohistochemistry methods. 19 consecutive
primary tumors from patients with untreated breast cancer
were included of which 17 were diagnosed as positive for
estrogen receptorα (ERα). IHC scores of positive cells
for cleaved caspase-3 and the standard hematoxylineosin-saffron staining were determined in the epithelial tumor
cells compartments. Such results obtained for two different
individual tumors, one responsive and one resistant to YM155
treatment, are presented in figure 1A. Among the cohort of
19 tumors, active caspase-3 staining displayed a mean score
of 24, 4% (ranging from 0 to 70%) in YM155-treated tumors
compared to 4, 5% (ranging from 0 to 10%) in untreated
(vehicle-treated) tumors (Figure 1B), indicating that YM155
significantly induced apoptosis in primary breast tumor cells.
We fixed a positive threshold above 20% of cleaved caspase
3 positive tumor cells, which is superior to the highest score
in untreated samples. Under these conditions, YM155
treatment identified 3 subgroups of breast tumors: the first
group exhibiting a response to YM155 above 20% in cleaved
caspase-3 staining, defined as sensitive tumors, included 10
tumors and the second including 7 tumors with caspase-3
scores under 5% was considered as YM155-resistant tumors.
For two tumors, the caspase-3 score was determined as 10%,
corresponding to an intermediate response. Importantly,
a robust correlation was noted between the percentage of
active caspase-3 tumor cells and tumor cell integrity, as
evaluated with HES staining performed on the same sample
(p = 0.0003). This strongly suggests that the active caspase-3
was a relevant marker of YM155-induced cytotoxicity on the
tumor samples in this ex vivo test.
10/19 tumors (52, 6%) were thus significantly sensitive
to YM155 used at 50 nM. Among them, 8 were ERα-positive
and 2 ERα-negative and all resistant or intermediate tumors
tested were ERα-positive. This clearly indicated that YM155
was a potent cell death inducer in primary breast cancer cells
in presence of their microenvironment in more than half
tumors included. This also revealed that 7/19 (36, 8%) tumors
were apparently resistant to YM155-induced cell death and
highlighted the need to unravel the signalling pathways
underpinning cancer cells’ response to YM155.

MB231, Cal51 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines were
first tested for their sensitivity to YM155 when grown
in a 2D in vitro assay. Using cell death assay and flow
cytometry analysis, we observed that a strong cell
death response was achieved in cells treated for 48 h at
50 nM. Dose-response analysis indicated that YM155
concentration equal to 40 nM for MCF-7, 50 nM for
MDA-MB231 and 70 nM for Cal-51, was sufficient
in killing 50% of corresponding breast cancer cells
(Figure 2A and data not shown). Of note, decreased
expression of Survivin and MCL1 proteins was detected
in YM155-treated cells using these YM155 concentrations
(Figure 4A and Supplementary figure S1 respectively).
In contrast the non-tumorigenic mammary cell
line MCF-10A (MCF-10A-ER-Src cultured in the
absence of TAM) was less sensitive and a concentration
of 200 nM was needed to kill half cells (Figure 2B).
Interestingly, transformation of these cells by induction

of the expression of v-src oncogene by TAM treatment,
as previously described [13], led to an increase in their
sensitivity to YM155, from 200 nM in the parental cell
line to 100 nM as concentrations needed to kill 50%
of cells (Figure 2B). This indicates that transformed
cells were more sensitive than their non-transformed
counterpart. Moreover, as breast cancer cell lines may
harbor a subpopulation of cancer initiating cells with
features resembling these of stem cells, we assessed
whether YM155 could target this subpopulation in the
MCF-7 cell line using an in vitro mammosphere formation
assay. Importantly, we observed a dramatic decrease in
mammosphere formation after YM155 treatment at 40
nM compared to control cells (Figure 2C). This suggests
that transformed cells and among them those presenting
stemness features might be more sensitive and that they
more critically rely on YM155′s targets for their survival
than their untransformed-counterpart.

primary human breast tumors (n = 19) were cultured 48 h with 50 nM YM155 or not treated (untreated). Samples were then analyzed for

We further sought to define which cell death
pathways YM155 treatment could activate in breast cancer
cells. We first observed that cleaved caspase-3, that is a
hallmark of apoptosis, appeared in YM155-treated cells
consistently with results obtained in ex vivo cultures
(Figure 3A). In addition, the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
protein BAX, was also cleaved upon YM155 treatment
(Figures 3A et 5D). These results argue for the activation of
caspase cascade triggered by YM155 treatment. However,
we could not observe any significant protection of cancer
cells from cell death using the pan-caspase inhibitor
Q-VD-OPh (Figure 3B). Same results were obtained
using Z-VAD-FMK as another pan-caspase inhibitor (data
not shown). We thus evaluated whether necroptosis or
autophagy contribute to cell death onset as these processes
are functional in presence of caspases inhibition. Using
necrostatin-1 as a specific inhibitor of RIP1, the main
kinase involved in necroptosis pathway, in combination
with caspase inhibitor or not did not lead to significant cell
protection against YM155 treatment. These results rule
out necroptosis as the apical activated cell death pathway
(Figure 3B). In contrast, blocking autophagy process using
either 3-MA or chloroquine, strongly protected cancer
cells from YM155-induced cell death in the 3 cell lines
(Figure 3C). Pretreatment using Bafilomycin A1 could
also protect cancer cells from YM155-induced cell death
(data not shown). We thus evaluated the autophagic flux
in YM155-treated cells compared to untreated cells using
LC3 marker (its cytoplasmic-associated form LC3I and its
autophagosome-associated form LC3II) by immunoblot
analysis. Decreased expression of LC3I and increased
expression of LC3II upon YM155 treatment suggested that
YM155 increased the autophagic flux in breast cancer cells
(Figures 3D and 5D). Moreover, IHC analysis revealed
LC3 expression as cytoplasmic vesicles in YM155-treated
cells compared to untreated control cells, that is a hallmark
of autophagy activation (Figure 3E). In addition, strong
LC3II accumulation was obtained upon chloroquine
treatment due to efficient autophagy blockade that was
maintained when combined with YM155. Finally, we also
detected accumulation of the autophagy adaptator p62/
SQSTM1 upon YM155 treatment for 48 h (Figure 5D).
Altogether, these results indicate that YM155 activates
an autophagy-dependent cell death pathway that harbors
caspase activation but that does not strictly rely on caspase
activity for cell death execution.

using immunoblot analysis (Figure 4A) as well as
nuclear γH2AX-foci formation by IHC (data not shown).
Importantly, this happened in both mutated or wild-type
p53 cell lines. In addition, eventhough both Survivin
and MCL1 protein levels (Figure 4A and Supplementary
Figure S1A) were decreased upon YM155 treatment, the
pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh did not protect cells
from DNA damage (data not shown). We then sought
for a DNA damage response upon YM155 treatment.
Using Cal51 cells transfected by a plasmid coding for
the protein fusion GFP-53BP-1, we detected significant
53BP-1 nuclear foci formation upon YM155 treatment
(Figure 4B) compared to untreated cells and cisplatintreated cells used as positive control. Moreover T68phosphorylated Chk2 was also detected after YM155
treatment. In contrast no S317-phosphorylated Chk1
could be detected (Figure 4C). These results argue for
the recruitment of early markers of DNA breaks and
initiation of DNA repair mainly involving ATM-Chk2
pathway. Using the wild-type (wt)-p53 cell line Cal51
or MCF-7, we evidenced p53 accumulation and S15
phosphorylation upon YM155 treatment (Figure 4A, right
panel and Figure 5D, respectively). Importantly increased
expression of p21 appeared in these cells after YM155
treatment. We thus sought whether YM155 might impact
cell cycle progress. Consistently, as shown in figures 4D
and 5C, YM155 treatment significantly slowed down
cell cycle progress with cells preferentially accumulating
in S-phase. Of note, this also occurred in p53 mutated
cells. Altogether these data indicate that YM155 induced
caspase-independent DNA damage in replicating cells and
triggered DNA damage response in breast cancer cells
leading to cell death independently of p53 status.

Blocking NF-kB pathway strongly protected
cancer cells from YM155-induced cell death
As NF-kB pathway stands at the cross-road of
various signalling pathways including cell death and
autophagy in cancer cells, we decided to decipher
whether it could contribute in breast cancer cells’ response
to YM155. Unexpectedly, using the IKK2 inhibitor
AS602868, we observed that pretreating cells with this
inhibitor before adding YM155, strongly protected
cells from YM155-induced cell death (Figure 5A).
The same effect was obtained using the pan-IKK inhibitor
BAY11-7085. We checked that AS602868 effectively
targeted canonical NF-kB pathway in breast cancer
cells by evaluating its capacity to counteract TNFalphainduced activation of NF-kB transcription using a
NF-kB gene reporter assay and to potentiate TNFalphainduced cell death. Both assays were conclusive,
arguing for the specificity of AS602868 to potently
inhibit conventional NF-kB pathway (Supplementary
Figure S1B and S1C). Importantly and consistent
with these results, RNA interference targeting IKK2

YM155 treatment had genotoxic effects and
triggered DNA damage response in breast cancer
cells
As YM155 was recently suspected to target DNA
[16] we evaluated whether YM155 had genotoxic effect
on breast cancer cells and might trigger DNA damage
response. We indeed observed the phosphorylation on
S139 of histone H2AX (γH2AX) upon YM155 treatment

cells were treated by YM155 at 40 nM and 70 nM respectively for 48 h and cleavage of caspase-3 and Bax proteins were evaluated
by immunoblot analysis. The arrow on Bax immunoblot indicates a cleaved form of Bax with 18KDa MW. B. MDA-MB321, MCF7 and Cal51 cells were first incubated with 10 μM of the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (Q) and/or with 1 μM of the RIP1 inhibitor
Necrostatin-1 (N) for 3 h then treated with respectively 50, 40 or 70 nM of YM155 for 48 h in presence of the above inhibitors (YM155) or
not (untreated). Cell death assays were then performed and % of dead cells determined in each indicated condition. No significant inhibition
of cell death was observed (n = 3). C. A similar pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitors Chloroquine (25 μM) or 3-MA was applied to
MDA-MB231, Cal51 or MCF-7 cells, followed by a 48 h-treatment by YM155 at above concentrations (YM155) or not (Un), before cell
death evaluation. D. Similar culture conditions were applied before performing immunoblot analysis for LC3 evaluation. When indicated,
Chloroquine pretreatment (25 μM) was realized 3 h before adding YM155. E. LC3 was evaluated by IHC in YM155-treated (+) at 40 nM
for 48 h versus untreated (–) Cal51 cells.
(Figure 5B right panel) also led to significant decrease
of YM155-induced cell death (Figure 5B, left panel).
In the opposite, cell death induced by TNFalpha was
increased upon IKK2 depletion, arguing for efficient
inhibition of NF-kB pathway. In an attempt to unravel
the impact of NF-kB pathway in autophagy-dependent
YM155-induced cell death, we compared chloroquine
and AS602868 effects on cancer cells response to
YM155. We first observed that AS602868 as well as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chloroquine pretreatment significantly impaired YM155dependent cell cycle blockade as shown for MCF-7
in Figure 5C and in MDA-MB231 (data not shown). In
addition, these inhibitors could partially protect cancer
cells from DNA damage triggered by YM155 treatment
and both of them modulated the subsequent p53 response
in these cells. Indeed in MCF-7 cells, p53 accumulation
was decreased upon pretreatment with AS602868 or
chloroquine before YM155 exposure (Figure 5D).

[2, 17]. Among them, the small molecule YM155 came
out of a high-throughput screening for inhibitors of
BIRC5 promoter activity and phase I clinical trials using
this compound, conducted in heavily pretreated cancer
patients provided evidence that an objective tumor
response could be achieved in some cases with an overall
favorable toxicity profile. Phase II studies of YM155
monotherapy recently reported more or less disappointing
results depending on the origine of tumors and on the
stage of the disease [18, 19] and clinical studies based
on combination including YM155 and conventional
chemotherapy are now ongoing. Importantly, in contrast
to initial statement, it appeared that Survivin was not the
only target of YM155 in cancer cells. As such, MCL1 was
identified as the pivotal YM155 target in myeloma cells
[20]. This raises the questions of whether this molecule
could be relevant in cancer therapy and how it may exert
its potential anticancer activity.
In this report, we focused on defining YM155 activity
in breast cancer cells. For the first time, we describe YM155
effect on human primary breast cancers in an ex vivo model
and we provide evidence that YM155-induced cell death
results from a complex signalling network involving
autophagy process and NF-kB pathway in response to

Consistent with this effect, YM155-induced p21 protein
accumulation was also impaired in cells pretreated with
AS602868 or chloroquine. Moreover, consistent with
results obtained in cell death assays, these treatments also
prevented BAX cleavage. Finally, AS602868 treatment
limited YM155-induced LC3II accumulation, suggesting
that NF-kB pathway and IKK2, may cross-talk with
autophagy signalling upon YM155 treatment (Figure 5D).
Blocking NF-kB pathway unexpectedly leads to strong
p62 accumulation in untreated cells, showing that NF-kB
and autophagy pathways can potently talk to each other.
Overall, our results suggest that NF-kB or autophagy
blockade spoiled p53 response in breast cancer cells upon
YM155 treatment and determined cancer cell fate through
interconnected signalling pathways.

DISCUSSION
Survivin overexpression in many human
tumors and its correlation with advanced disease,
treatment resistance, and poor outcome, have hig­
hlighted its potential value as a relevant target
for cancer therapy. In this line, some natural or
chemical Survivin suppressors have been identified

in response to doxorubicin in a similar ex vivo model,
indicating that cell death pathways with caspase activation
are major response of tumors to anticancer treatment
[21]. In addition, in breast cancer cell lines upon YM155
treatment, we observe not only caspase-3 activation,
as previously reported [22], but also BAX cleavage,
suggesting that activation of a cascade of proteases
including calpains involved in BAX proteolysis [23, 24]
and caspases, happened in response to YM155. However,
caspase inhibition using pharmacological inhibitors could
not protect cancer cells from cell death, excluding apoptosis
as the main executive cell death pathway triggered by

YM155-induced DNA damage. Importantly, this effect
appeared independently from p53 status of cancer cells.
We first observed that YM155 induced significant
cancer cell death in more than half (10/19) human primary
breast tumors in an ex vivo organotypic culture assay that
maintains tumor integrity including breast cancer cells and
their microenvironment [15]. Indeed, using IHC analysis,
we found a strong correlation between morphological
changes in carcinomatous cells and cleaved caspase-3
positive staining suggesting that cell death was a major
process of YM155 sensitivity. Interestingly, cleaved
caspase-3 that is a hallmark of apoptosis, was also detected

YM155 treatment. The RIP1 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 was
also inefficient in blocking YM155-induced cell death, even
in combination with a pan-caspase inhibitor, demonstrating
that necroptosis was neither involved in YM155-induced
cell death pathway. In contrast, blocking autophagy
process either upstream with 3-MA or downstream with
chloroquine, potently counteracted cell death onset due to
YM155 treatment. These results are consistent with those
of Wang or Cheng and colleagues who in addition, report
an autophagy-dependent activation of caspases induced
by YM155 [25, 26]. Collectively these results and ours
provide evidence that autophagy process controls cell death
triggering upon YM155 treatment. As frequently observed
with chemotherapy, YM155 induces autophagy activation
in breast cancer cells. In many cases, autophagy constitutes
a strategy to adapt to and cope with stress. However, since
autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway, that may
lead to lysosome membrane disruption (LMP), it can be
an alternative mechanism of programmed cell death that
precedes apoptotic cell death [27]. LMP results in the
release of hydrolases in the cytoplasm leading to protein
digestion and activation of additional enzymes including
caspases and to cell lethality [28]. Chloroquine that in
relation with its lysosomotropic property inhibits hydrolase
activity, probably blocks the proteolytic cascade triggered
by YM155 treatment and by this way, cell death onset.
Interestingly, profound changes in lysosomal compartment
affect cancer cells and this may be the cause of their higher
sensitivity to YM155 compared to non transformed cells
we observed. Thus linking YM155 activity and lysosomes
biology represents an appealing perspective that we are
currently exploring.
Since YM155 may behave as a DNA intercalating
agent, capable of interfering with DNA relaxing in an
acellular assay [29], we further explored whether YM155
induced DNA damage in breast cancer cells. Our data
clearly indicated that YM155 treatment triggered not only
DNA damage but also initiated a DNA repair response. Of
particular interest, when we turned to cell cycle analysis,
we found that YM155 treatment induced an accumulation
of replicating cells with DNA contents between 2n and
4n. This is consistent with previous demonstration of
significant impact of YM155 on DNA synthesis [16].
Collectively, recent reports and our results strongly argue
for classifing YM155 as a DNA damaging agent rather
than as a pure Survivin suppressor. Importantly, our data
indicate that YM155-induced cell death did not depend
on p53 status of cancer cells and confirm the observation
reported by Nakahara and colleagues [30].
Finally, using the NF-kB inhibitor targeting IKK2,
we provide evidence that the canonical NF-kB pathway
contributes to YM155-induced cell death. Indeed, targeting
IKK2 by pharmacological inhibitors as well as RNA
interference, strongly blunted YM155 cytotoxic effect. In
stressfull conditions, IKK2 that belongs with IKK1 and
NEMO to the IKK complex, is frequently activated leading
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to IkBα phosphorylation and the subsequent release of
NF-kB dimeres whose nuclear translocation allows their
transcriptional activity [31]. Interestingly, upon genotoxic
stress, an ATM/ATR-dependent control of NEMO may
drive the NF-kB response towards promotion rather than
inhibition of cell death in triggering a complex NF-kB
dependent transcriptional program that include both pro
and anti-apoptotic genes [32]. In this line, NF-kB pathway
can control TNFalpha release upon DNA damage then
determining the final outcome of cancer cells [33]. Of major
interest, our results indicate that both NF-kB or autophagy
inhibition prevent breast cancer cells from cell cycle
blockade and cell death triggering upon YM155 treatment.
In addition, NF-kB inhibition in YM155 treated cells
decreases autophagy activation. Our results argue for the
control of YM155-induced cell death by NF-kB upstream the
autophagic process and reveal the complex inteconnections
between these signaling pathways. In addition, they indicate
that eventhough YM155 triggers DNA damage, this effect
may not be the initial event in the signaling cascade since
inhibiting either NF-kB or autophagy pathways prevents
DNA damage detection. Further experiments are needed
to precisely unravel this signaling network that finally
dictates cancer cell fate upon YM155 treatment but may also
interfere with other genotoxic agents.
Altogether, our data provide evidence that YM155
is an effective cell death inducer in breast cancer cells,
even in presence of their microenvironment and that both
homeostatic pathways NF-kB and autophagy control the
signaling pathway leading to cell death in YM155-treated
cells. YM155, that is probably not a specific Survivin
inhibitor, remains a valuable anticancer drug. Despite, a
remarkable efficacy in preclinical studies, the first results
of clinical trials based on YM155 used as single agent
were disappointing. This possibly reflects the incompletely
identified molecular targets of the drug and/or the absence
of biomarkers for patient stratification. The functional
evaluation of tumor response to YM155, in the way we
report in this study, may help to identify patients that could
benefit from this therapy. Ex vivo results will indeed help
us to define the molecular determinants involved in the
breast cancer resistance to first-line YM155 treatment.
In addition, eventhough combining YM155 with either
conventional anticancer drugs [19, 34, 35] or innovative
molecules such as BH3 mimetics [36, 37] are already in
progress in clinical trials with carboplatin and paclitaxel in
patients with solid tumors, our results raise some concerns
about relevant combination since NF-kB and autophagy
pathways may interfere with those therapeutics.

MATERIALs AND METHODS
Reagents and cell lines
MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cell lines were from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
13483

Oncotarget

USA), and Cal51 from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany).
The ER-Src MCF-10A cell line was a generous gift of Dr
Kevin Struhl (Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA).
All cell lines were cultured following supplier’s recom­
mendations. The ER-Src MCF-10A cells contain an
integrated fusion of the v-Src oncoprotein and the ligandbinding domain of estrogen receptor and are induced to
rapidly transform when grown with 1 μM 4OH-TAM
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Yvelines, France), as
previously described [13].
YM155, Necrostatin-1 and BAY11-7085 were pur­
chased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, USA) and the
pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh from R&DSystems
(Abingdon, UK). Chloroquine, 3-Methyl-Adenin (3-MA),
Bafilomycin A1 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (SaintQuentin Yvelines, France). AS602868 was a generous gift
of Merck-Serono International SA [14]. Antibodies against
Survivin was purchased from R&DSystems (Lille, France),
antibodies against LC3, p21, pS15-p53, pS317-Chk1, pT68Chk2, IKK2, Actin, γH2AX from Merck Millipore (SaintQuentin en Yvelines, France), antibodies against HSP90,
p53 and cleaved (i.e. activated) caspase3 from Becton
Dickinson (Pont de Claix, France), antibody against BAX
from Dako (Courtaboeuf, France), and antibody against p62
from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany).

analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur using the
CellQuestPro software in the CytoCell flow cytometry
facility (SFR Bonamy, FED4203/Inserm UMS 016/CNRS
3556, Nantes, France).

Cell cycle assay
Cells were treated by YM155 for 48 h (following
pretreatment using either Chloroquine 25 μM or AS602868
10 μM, when indicated), then harvested and fixed overnight
in PBS-FBS 12.5%-ethanol 50%. After washing in PBS,
cells were resuspended in a solution of PBS-PI (Propidium
Iodide 13.5 μg/ml). Flow-cytometry analysis was performed
on a FACSCalibur by using the CellQuestPro software.

Mammosphere formation assay
MCF-7 cells were grown in serum-free mammary
epithelial cell growth medium containing DMEM-F12
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin, France) supplemented
with B27 (Life Technologies, Saint-Aubin, France) and
MEGM singlequots (Lonza, Verviers, France) for 7 days,
as previously described [15], in presence of YM155 (50
nM) or not. Mammosphere-forming unit were counted as
number of mammospheres ≥ 50 μm. Data are mean ± sem
of 3 independent experiments.

Preclinical breast cancer ex vivo assay

Immunoblot analysis

Fresh human mammary samples were obtained from
chemotherapy naive patients with invasive carcinoma after
surgical resection at the Institut de Cancérologie de l’Ouest,
René Gauducheau, Nantes, France. As required by the French
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, informed
consent was obtained from study patients to use their surgical
specimens and clinicopathological data for research purposes,
and the local ethic committee approved protocols. The
tumors were cut into thin slices (250 μm) using a vibratome
(Microm Microtech, Francheville, France) and incubated for
48 h with or without 50 nM YM155. Slices were then fixed
in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. Sections
(3 μm) were then cut for standard histological analysis
assessed by hematoxylin-eosin-saffron (HES) coloration
and immunohistochemistry analysis using cleaved caspase-3
antibody, as a cell death marker, as previously described [15].
Percentages of positive cells for cleaved caspase-3 staining
among 200 carcinomatous cells were established. Expression
for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was defined in parallel by
IHC for diagnostic purpose.

Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS;
10 mM EDTA; 50mM Tris-Hcl pH8,1; 1mM PMSF; 10
μg.ml−1 aprotinine; 10 μg.mL−1 leupeptine; 10 μg.mL−1
pepstatine; 1mM Na3VO4 and 50mM NaF) and sonicated
with Bioruptor apparatus from Diagenode. Protein
concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid
(BCA protein assay, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Fifty
micrograms of proteins were loaded for each lane and
separated by 10%, 12.5% or 15% SDS-PAGE, then
electrotransfered to PVDF membranes. Western blot
analysis was performed by standard techniques with ECL
detection (Bio-Rad, Marne-la coquette, France).

RNA interference
Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine
RNAiMax™ (Life Technologies, Saint-Aubin, France)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Medium was
changed 6 hours later and compounds were added after 24
hours. The siRNA control and IKK2 were purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific (St Leon Rot, Germany).

Cell death assays

Immunofluorescence imaging

Cell death was assessed either by Apo2.7 (Beckman
Coulter, Grenoble, France) staining or Annexin-V
binding assay (Miltenyi Biotec, Paris, France) performed
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry

Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and grown
for 24 h prior to a 48 h treatment with YM155. After
immunostaining using LC3 antibody and 488-Alexa goat-

13484

Oncotarget

anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes (Paisley,
UK). 53BP-1 expressing Cal51 cells were obtained after
transient transfection using the GFP-53BP-1c coding plasmid
obtained from Dr Thomas Von Zglinicki (New Castle
University, UK). They were then plated onto glass coverslip,
treated by the indicated agents for 48 h. In both cases, cells
were counterstained with DAPI and images were viewed on a
Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope in the MicroPIcell imaging
facility (SFR Bonamy, FED4203/Inserm UMS 016/CNRS
3556, Nantes, France). % of cells with GFP staining were
established in 53BP-1 expressing cells.
