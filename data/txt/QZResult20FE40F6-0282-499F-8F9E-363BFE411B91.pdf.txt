BACKGROUND. The study compared tumor characteristics and survival in women
with breast cancer who subsequently developed endometrial cancer with or without a history of tamoxifen use.
METHODS. The British Columbia Cancer Agency registry identified 163 women
diagnosed with breast cancer between 1989–1999 who received a subsequent diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Of these, 55% (n ¼ 90) had a history of tamoxifen
use. Outcomes analyzed were breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), endometrial
cancer-specific survival (ECSS), and overall survival (OS).

RESULTS. Median follow-up was 9.4 years. Distributions of age, menopausal status, body mass index, and comorbidities were similar in the tamoxifen-treated
and nontamoxifen cohorts. Proportions of aggressive endometrial cancer subtypes including papillary serous, clear cell, and mixed mullerian tumors were
higher in the tamoxifen cohort (28% vs14%, P ¼ .03). Distributions of endometrial
cancer grade and stage were similar in the 2 groups (P > .05). Hysterectomy and/
or oophorectomy were the primary treatments for endometrial cancer in 99% of
patients, with comparable pelvic control rates in the tamoxifen and nontamoxifen groups. At 10 years, patients in the tamoxifen group experienced lower BCSS
compared with the nontamoxifen group (89% vs 97%, P ¼ .02). No significant differences in ECSS and OS were observed between the 2 groups (ECSS 82% and
82%, P ¼ .85; and OS 69% v. 66%, P ¼ .85).

CONCLUSIONS. In patients with breast cancer who developed a subsequent endometrial cancer, tamoxifen-treated patients had higher proportions of aggressive
endometrial cancer subtypes, but almost all cases were amenable to surgery, thus
resulting in similar endometrial cancer control and survival when compared with
nontamoxifen treated patients. Cancer 2007;110:31–7.  2007 American Cancer

amoxifen (ICI 46 474) is widely used as adjuvant systemic therapy
in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.1–3
Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator that exerts various effects throughout the human body, including both estrogenic
and antiestrogenic properties.1–3 By blocking the growth-promoting
effects of estrogen in breast tissue, tamoxifen has the potential to
reduce risk of breast cancer recurrence and improve survival for
women with ER-positive disease.2,3
The decision to administer adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast
cancer requires careful consideration of treatment-related benefits
and adverse effects. Tamoxifen is associated with an approximately 2fold increased risk of endometrial cancer.2–7 The endometrial cancers

occurring after tamoxifen use have been reported to
be prognostically favorable, well-differentiated tumors.6–8
In recent years, however, other studies have raised the
concern that tamoxifen-related endometrial cancers
may behave more aggressively compared with those
found in patients with unopposed estrogen.9–11 With
the availability of newer hormonal compounds for
breast cancer, including aromatase inhibitors, which
are associated with fewer treatment-related endometrial pathology,12,13 the question of whether tamoxifen-related endometrial cancer is associated with
poorer outcomes compared with nontamoxifenrelated endometrial cancer warrants further scrutiny.
This article reports a population-based analysis of
tumor characteristics and survival in women with
breast cancer who subsequently developed endometrial cancer. The aim of this study is to compare clinical characteristics and survival outcomes between
patients treated with tamoxifen versus those who
were not treated with tamoxifen (nontamoxifen).

trieval to ensure that up-to-date information on disease recurrence and death was available.
Patient characteristics analyzed were age and
menopausal status at the time of breast cancer and
endometrial cancer diagnosis, comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes, body mass index, history of exogenous estrogen use, history of smoking
and alcohol ingestion, and family history of gynecologic malignancies. Breast tumor and treatment factors analyzed were primary tumor size, axillary nodal
involvement, ER status, type of surgery, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy used. Endometrial tumor factors
analyzed were histologic type, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade, FIGO
stage, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Among the
tamoxifen-treated cohort, durations of tamoxifen use
and time intervals between the start and end of tamoxifen relative to the diagnosis of endometrial cancer were recorded. The outcomes evaluated were
breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), endometrial
cancer-specific survival (ECSS), and overall survival
(OS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The British Columbia Cancer Registry identified
24,983 primary breast cancer cases diagnosed between 1989 and 1999, without previous or synchronous cancer of any site, except nonmelanoma skin
cancer. Of these, 168 patients had a subsequent diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Chart review was conducted to abstract data on patient characteristics,
breast and endometrial tumor factors, treatment, and
survival. Five patients, in whom the presenting
symptoms of endometrial cancer could be tracked to
the time prior to or within 1 month of breast cancer
diagnosis, were excluded because their breast and
endometrial cancers were more likely to be synchronous rather than sequential primary cancers. The
remaining 163 patients formed the study cohort for
this analysis. Ninety (55%) of these patients had a
history of tamoxifen use. Median follow-up time was
9.4 years. The study was approved by the institution’s
research ethics board.
Data were extracted on each subject’s dates of
pathologic diagnoses of breast cancer and subsequent endometrial cancer, dates and sites of disease
recurrence, and date of death. Patients were followed
at the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) and
in the community. For patients who were discharged
from the BCCA and followed by their primary-care
physicians, recurrence information was obtained
from the community physician on an annual basis.
Death information was obtained from the Department of Vital Statistics on a monthly basis. Patients
were censored 6 months prior to the date of data re-

Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics, tumor factors, and treatment
factors for breast cancer and endometrial cancer
were statistically compared by chi-square tests
between 2 cohorts, patients treated with tamoxifen
versus those not treated with tamoxifen (nontamoxifen cohort). Ten-year survival estimates were calculated by using Kaplan-Meier methods. Statistical
significance of survival differences was determined
by using the log-rank test. All statistical tests were 2tailed, with the level of significance established at
P < .05. All analyses were conducted by using SPSS
software (Version 14.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patient and Breast Cancer Clinicopathologic
Characteristics
Characteristics of patients and breast tumors in the
entire cohort and comparisons between groups treated with and without tamoxifen are summarized in
Table 1. The median age at breast cancer diagnosis
was 65 years, (range, 41–87 years). Distributions of
age, menopausal status, and estrogen-receptor (ER)
status were similar in the tamoxifen and nontamoxifen cohorts. Subjects who received tamoxifen
had larger breast tumors (P < .001) and were more
likely to have axillary nodal involvement (P < .001).
Mastectomy and chemotherapy were used more frequently in tamoxifen-treated patients (P ¼ .05 and

Endometrial Cancer Risk Factors and
Clinicopathologic Characteristics
Comparisons of endometrial cancer risk factors and
tumor characteristics in the tamoxifen-treated and
nontamoxifen patients are presented in Table 2. The
median age at the time of endometrial cancer diagnosis was 70 years (range, 45–89 years), with similar
age distributions in the 2 groups (P ¼ .83). No significant differences were observed in body mass index
or distributions of comorbid conditions including
hypertension, diabetes, or history of exogenous
estrogen use. Proportions of subjects with a family
history of gynecologic and gastrointestinal cancer or
with a personal history of smoking and/or alcohol

ingestion were not significantly different between the
tamoxifen-treated and nontamoxifen cohorts (all
P > .05, data not shown). In the tamoxifen-treated
cohort, aggressive endometrial cancer histologic
types, including papillary serous carcinoma, clearcell carcinoma, and malignant mixed-mullerian
tumors, were present in higher proportions compared with nontamoxifen patients (28% vs 14%,
P ¼ .03). The majority of endometrial cancers were
stage I disease. The distributions of FIGO stage,
grade, and lymphovascular invasion were comparable between the 2 groups (all P > .05).

cancer in both tamoxifen-treated and nontamoxifen
patients (90% and 94%, respectively, P ¼ .47). Other
signs and symptoms, including abdominal or pelvic
pain, vaginal discharge, and weight loss, were less
common and were not significantly different between the 2 cohorts. The methods of diagnosis of endometrial cancer were also similar between the 2
groups, dilatation and curettage (66%), office endometrial biopsy (24%), and incidental finding at time
of hysterectomy for reasons other than bleeding
(9%). Treatment of endometrial cancer was similar in
tamoxifen users and nonusers. The vast majority
(99%) underwent hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. Postoperative radiotherapy use was not significantly different between the 2 groups (33% in
tamoxifen and 44% in nontamoxifen cohort, P ¼ .16).

Timing of Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Tamoxifen Use
Relative to Endometrial Cancer Diagnosis
The median time interval between breast cancer and
endometrial diagnosis was 63 months (range, 6–240
months) in the tamoxifen cohort and 56 months
(range, 6–254 months) in the nontamoxifen cohort
(P ¼ .07). All tamoxifen-treated patients were prescribed 20 mg orally once per day. The median duration of tamoxifen use was 46 months (range, 3–138
months). Of 90 tamoxifen users who developed endometrial cancer, 39 (43%) had the endometrial cancer diagnosed while on tamoxifen therapy. The mean
and median time intervals between starting tamoxifen and diagnosis of endometrial cancer were 68
and 58 months, respectively (range, 6–204 months).
Among subjects diagnosed with endometrial cancer
after stopping tamoxifen, the mean interval between
completing tamoxifen treatment and diagnosis of
endometrial cancer was 24 months (range, 0–198
months).
Relapse and Survival Outcomes
Endometrial cancer relapse and survival outcomes
according to tamoxifen use are summarized in Table
3. The 10-year endometrial cancer-specific survival
was 82% for subjects diagnosed with endometrial
cancer whether they received tamoxifen or not. Similar pelvic and distant relapse rates were observed in
the 2 cohorts. Among patients who relapsed, 76% of
relapses occurred within 3 years from endometrial
cancer diagnosis with the median time to relapse not
significantly different between the 2 groups (11
months vs 14 months, P ¼ .28). Response to salvage
treatment was also similar between the 2 groups
(P ¼ .75).
At 10 years, patients in the tamoxifen-treated
group experienced lower BCSS compared with the
nontamoxifen group (Fig. 1). No significant differences in ECSS and OS were observed between the tamoxifen-treated and nontamoxifen groups (Figs. 2
and 3).

DISCUSSION
Tamoxifen is currently one of the most widely used
drugs in oncology practice. Randomized controlled
trials and large meta-analyses have demonstrated
that tamoxifen improves recurrence-free and overall
survival in premenopausal and postmenopausal
patients with ER-positive breast cancer.2 Tamoxifen

also has potential use as chemoprevention for populations at high risk of developing breast cancer.7 The
adverse effects of tamoxifen therapy have been
described in numerous investigations and overviews.
Although the increased risk of endometrial cancer
among tamoxifen users is clearly established,2,4,5,7
data on tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer
outcomes have been less consistent. The current
analysis found higher proportions of aggressive endometrial cancer subtypes in tamoxifen-treated
patients, but the majority of these were early stage
and amenable to definitive surgery. Overall, the endometrial cancer disease control and endometrial
cancer-specific survival were comparable for patients
developing endometrial cancer after a diagnosis of
breast cancer, whether or not they had received tamoxifen.
Studies comparing outcomes in women who
developed endometrial cancer after breast cancer
with or without tamoxifen have yielded disparate
results. Some reports have suggested that endometrial cancers in tamoxifen users and nontamoxifen
patients have similar histopathologic characteristics
and prognosis.6–8 Other studies have suggested that
tamoxifen-related endometrial cancer is a distinct
entity with different biological behavior and less
favorable outcomes compared with endometrial cancer that develops in nontamoxifen patients.9–11 In a
series from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center with 73 patients with breast cancer and subsequent endometrial cancer, 23 of whom had tamoxi-

fen treatment, the proportion of high-risk endometrial
cancer histologic subtypes was 26% and was similar
in the tamoxifen-treated and nontamoxifen cohorts.8
In the current analysis, the proportion of aggressive
endometrial cancer histologic subtypes was 28% in
tamoxifen-treated patients, representing a 2-fold
increase compared with the rate observed in nontamoxifen patients.
A report that used the Yale-New Haven Hospital
Tumor Registry examined 53 patients with endometrial cancer after primary breast cancer.9 Higher rates
of poorly differentiated endometrial tumors and more
aggressive histologic subtypes, such as papillary

36

serous, clear-cell, or malignant mixed-mullerian
tumors, were observed among 15 tamoxifen users
compared with 38 nontamoxifen patients (67% vs
24%, P ¼ .03).9 Similarly, in a French case-control
study of 153 women with breast cancer followed by
endometrial cancer and 467 controls with breast cancer and an intact uterus with no endometrial cancer,
Mignotte et al found that tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer was associated with more advanced
stage and poorer prognosis.10
Whereas the current study is limited by its retrospective design and treatment-selection biases, the
finding of similar FIGO stage and grade distributions
and similar endometrial cancer-specific prognosis in
tamoxifen-treated and nontamoxifen cohorts is consistent with data obtained from large, prospective series.5,7 The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project (NSABP) B-14 trial, which included
2843 patients with node-negative, ER-positive invasive breast cancer randomly assigned to placebo or
tamoxifen, plus 1220 tamoxifen-treated patients registered in the trial subsequent to randomization,
identified 24 cases of endometrial cancer. Of these,
21 were stage I and 18 had grade 1–2 disease. Four
tamoxifen-treated patients died of endometrial cancer, but the endometrial cancer cases that occurred
in the tamoxifen group did not appear to be different
in characteristics or outcomes compared with the
placebo group.5 Similarly, the NSABP P-1 prevention
study, which included 13,388 women, identified 51
cases of endometrial cancer, 36 of whom received tamoxifen. All endometrial cancer cases in the tamoxifen group and 14 of 15 cases in the placebo group
were stage I.7 No endometrial cancer deaths had
occurred at 69 months of follow-up.7

In our study, patient-related risk factors for endometrial cancer including age, history of unopposed
estrogen use, and comorbid conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes were similar between
the tamoxifen-treated and nontamoxifen groups.
Abnormal bleeding was the most common presenting symptom that led to investigation and diagnosis
of endometrial cancer. At our institution, women
treated with tamoxifen were advised to undergo regular gynecologic examination by their primary-care
physician and to seek medical attention if abnormal
bleeding occurred. No specific diagnostic measures,
such as pelvic or intravaginal ultrasound, were recommended based on tamoxifen treatment alone, a
strategy supported by 2 studies demonstrating that
screening by endometrial biopsy or transvaginal
ultrasound were not warranted in patients receiving
tamoxifen.14,15
Local and systemic management of endometrial
cancer were found to be similar among tamoxifentreated and nontamoxifen patients. Despite a higher
rate of more aggressive endometrial cancer subtypes
among tamoxifen users, the majority of cases were
early stage and amenable to primary surgical therapy.
The rate of induction of remission and the proportions of endometrial cancer relapse at pelvic and distant sites were similar in both groups. Tamoxifenrelated endometrial cancer in this study is, thus, not
associated with poorer endometrial cancer-specific
survival. These results are consistent with data from
prospective trials6,7,16 and other population-based
studies.17,18
In the current report, tamoxifen-treated women
experienced higher breast cancer-related mortality
compared with nontamoxifen women. Although indications for tamoxifen have expanded in the past decade, during the period of this study, tamoxifen was
not generally prescribed for patients with favorablerisk breast cancer with small primary tumors and
negative axillary nodes. Accordingly, the lower breast
cancer-specific survival in the tamoxifen group was
likely related to significantly more advanced primary
breast tumor size and nodal stage in this group.
To better appraise the risk-benefit ratio attributable to tamoxifen therapy, Ragaz and Coldman evaluated the survival impact of adjuvant tamoxifen on
competing causes of mortality in breast cancer survivors.19 By using published tamoxifen-associated
relative risks of 4 conditions (contralateral breast
cancer, cardiovascular events, endometrial cancer,
and thromboembolism) and applying these to agespecific mortality rates for the same conditions, the
researchers demonstrated that the impact of tamoxifen was expressed as the net mortality difference

Breast CA and Endometrial CA Outcomes/Saadat et al.

between tamoxifen users and nonusers. These
authors demonstrated that at 10 years of follow-up,
in addition to tamoxifen’s effect on reducing breast
cancer recurrence, the sum of avoided deaths from
contralateral breast cancer, cardiovascular events,
and excess deaths from endometrial cancer and
thromboembolism resulted in an overall net mortality reduction with tamoxifen therapy.19
Whereas aromatase inhibitors are increasingly
used in the adjuvant setting for postmenopausal
women with hormone-responsive breast cancer and
have fewer endometrium-related pathologies,12,13 optimal strategies to use aromatase inhibitors in substitution or in sequence with tamoxifen remain to be
established. A decision to administer adjuvant hormonal therapy requires long-term prospective data to
compare and balance benefits of these drugs versus
their gynecologic and nongynecologic adverse effects.

7.

Conclusion
This population-based analysis of women with primary breast cancer who developed a subsequent
endometrial cancer suggests that tamoxifen is associated with higher proportions of aggressive endometrial cancer subtypes. However, these were
predominantly early stage and almost all were amenable to surgery resulting in similar pelvic and distant control rates, endometrial cancer-specific
survival, and overall survival for tamoxifen-treated
and nontamoxifen patients.
