The MYC–WDR5 Nexus and Cancer
Lance R. Thomas, Audra M. Foshage, April M. Weissmiller, and
William P. Tansey

Abstract
The MYC oncogenes encode a family of transcription factors
that feature prominently in cancer. MYC proteins are overexpressed or deregulated in a majority of malignancies and
drive tumorigenesis by inducing widespread transcriptional
reprogramming that promotes cell proliferation, metabolism,
and genomic instability. The ability of MYC to regulate transcription depends on its dimerization with MAX, which creates
a DNA-binding domain that recognizes speciﬁc sequences in
the regulatory elements of MYC target genes. Recently, we
discovered that recognition of target genes by MYC also
depends on its interaction with WDR5, a WD40-repeat protein

that exists as part of several chromatin-regulatory complexes.
Here, we discuss how interaction of MYC with WDR5 could
create an avidity-based chromatin recognition mechanism that
allows MYC to select its target genes in response to both genetic
and epigenetic determinants. We rationalize how the MYC–
WDR5 interaction provides plasticity in target gene selection by
MYC and speculate on the biochemical and genomic contexts
in which this interaction occurs. Finally, we discuss how properties of the MYC–WDR5 interface make it an attractive point
for discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of MYC function in
cancer cells. Cancer Res; 75(19); 4012–5. Ó2015 AACR.

Introduction

trimethylation (4). The molecular mechanisms through which
chromatin context shapes target gene selection by MYC are
largely unknown, but our recent work suggests that one way
this occurs is via interaction of MYC with the prevalent chromatin-associated protein WDR5 (5). Here, we discuss how
WDR5 inﬂuences target gene selection by MYC and speculate
on the implications of our ﬁndings.

MYC oncogenes encode a family of related transcription factors
that are overexpressed in a majority of malignancies (1). The
ectopic appearance of MYC in a cell induces widespread transcriptional changes that drive cell-cycle progression, enhance
protein synthesis, reprogram cellular metabolism, and destabilize
the genome (2). This near-perfect suite of protumorigenic functions, together with their pervasive deregulation in cancer, has
fueled the concept that blocking MYC function in cancer cells
could have a signiﬁcant therapeutic impact. Indeed, in numerous
mouse models, genetic inhibition of MYC promotes tumor
regression (2), securing a place for MYC proteins as bona ﬁde
targets of anticancer therapies.
As transcription factors, the ability of MYC proteins to
recognize regulatory elements in the promoters and enhancers
of target genes is crucial for their function. Incapable of binding
DNA alone, MYC heterodimerizes with MAX (3) to form a
DNA-binding module that recognizes the "E-box" motif
(CACGTG) common in MYC-responsive genes. Although interaction with MAX is required for MYC to bind DNA, precisely
where MYC engages the genome is profoundly inﬂuenced by
chromatin context. Indeed, MYC/MAX dimers associate exclusively with E-boxes found in regions of active chromatin,
marked by speciﬁc sets of histone modiﬁcations—the most
notable of which are H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) dimethylation and

WDR5 Is a Cofactor for MYC
The major ﬁndings of our work (5) can be summarized as
follows. MYC binds directly to WDR5, a highly conserved
protein found in multiple chromatin regulatory complexes
(6), including the MLL histone methyltransferases that catalyze
H3K4 methylation. MYC and WDR5 colocalize extensively on
chromatin, with approximately 80% of the genomic sites occupied by MYC also bound by WDR5. MYC binds WDR5 via a
short sequence motif—EEIDVV—present in all MYC family
members from all species. Structure-guided mutations in MYC
that disrupt interaction with WDR5 do not affect the latter's
recruitment to chromatin, nor do they disrupt the ability of
MYC to bind E-boxes in naked DNA. These mutations do,
however, prevent MYC from binding to approximately 80%
of its chromosomal locations and attenuate its tumorigenic
potential in mice. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the MYC–
WDR5 interaction plays an important role in directing the
association of MYC with chromatin and reveal that WDR5 is
a critical cofactor for MYC-driven tumorigenesis.
We propose that stable association of MYC with target gene
chromatin is governed by two sets of interactions: one between
MYC/MAX dimers and DNA, and another between MYC and
chromatin-bound WDR5. We refer to this mechanism of target
gene recognition by MYC as "facilitated recruitment" (Fig. 1).
Although key aspects of the facilitated recruitment model have yet
to be challenged, this revised view of chromatin recognition by
MYC proteins reconciles much of their behavior and raises a
number of intriguing questions we discuss below.

Facilitated Recruitment of MYC to Chromatin

Facilitated recruitment of MYC to
chromatin by interaction with
WDR5. The cartoon represents two
different genes in two different cell
types. Both genes carry E-box
consensus sites for binding MYC/
MAX dimers. In cell type A, gene A
has recently been transcribed and is
marked by the presence of both
H3K4 methylation (Me) and WDR5,
which exists as part of a multiprotein
complex (gray ovals). Because
stable chromatin recognition by
MYC depends on both DNA and
WDR5 interactions, MYC associates
with gene A, and not gene B, in this
cell. In cell type B, the situation is
reversed and only gene B can recruit
MYC.

Transcriptional Plasticity and Ampliﬁcation
One notable feature of MYC is the breadth of transcriptional
changes it induces. In any given cell type, it is not unusual to see
changes in the expression of thousands of genes in response to
MYC (2). What is equally notable, however, is that within this
broad transcriptional response there is very little overlap
between cell types, with only about 70 genes regulated by MYC
in all contexts (7). The diversity of these transcriptional
responses reveals that target gene selection by MYC is inherently plastic and implies that additional mechanisms must exist
to program which DNA elements in the genome capture MYC/
MAX complexes.
The facilitated recruitment model can help explain the plasticity
of target gene selection by MYC in several ways. As an aviditybased mechanism, facilitated recruitment integrates two distinct
types of information—DNA sequence and WDR5 location—to
determine where MYC will bind across the genome. In this view, if
WDR5 is distributed differently in different cell types, different
groups of E-boxes will be permissive for MYC binding (Fig. 1).
Moreover, facilitated recruitment links to plasticity because
WDR5 connects to both MYC and H3K4 methylation. As mentioned, H3K4 dimethylation and trimethylation correlates tightly
with MYC binding across the genome, so tightly that it has been
called a "strict prerequisite" for target gene recognition by MYC
(4). Importantly, these methylation events mark transcriptionally
active chromatin (8, 9) and are plastic because their distribution is
determined by which genes are active in a given cell type. Because
WDR5 is both a component of MLL complexes and capable of
interacting speciﬁcally with H3K4 methylated histone tails (10),
its distribution in cells closely mirrors H3K4 methylation patterns
(11). It may be, therefore, that the correlation between MYC and
H3K4 methylation has nothing to do with histone methylation
per se, but with the distribution of WDR5 at these sites, which
makes them available to bind MYC. By this logic, WDR5 may also
play a key role in the recently proposed ability of MYC to drive
tumorigenesis by "amplifying" transcriptional programs already
in place in a given cell type (12, 13), which is based in large part on
the concept that MYC can recognize which genes in the cell are
marked as active.

Biochemical Context of the MYC–WDR5
Interaction
WDR5 is a versatile protein. In addition to its role in MLL
complexes, WDR5 is also present in several other chromatinmodifying complexes, including the NSL histone acetyltransferase
(14). One of the ways this small protein achieves such versatility is
by reusing its interaction surfaces in different contexts. In MLL
complexes, for example, WDR5 binds its essential partner protein
RBBP5 via a shallow hydrophobic cleft that is draped in basic
amino acid side chains (15). In NSL complexes, this same cleft of
WDR5 binds a different protein, KANSL2 (14), that is critical for
histone acetyltransferase activity. This shared cleft is poignant here
because this is precisely the same surface that WDR5 uses to
interact with MYC (5). The near-identical ways that RBBP5,
KANSL2, and MYC associate with WDR5 reveals that no two
proteins can bind WDR5 at the same time via this surface and
implies a functional signiﬁcance. But what can it be?
One possibility is that MYC engages WDR5 outside the context
of an MLL or NSL complex. In this case, the mutually exclusive
binding would be a tidy way of keeping the complexes distinct,
allowing WDR5 to serve critical, yet independent, roles in multiple processes. A more intriguing possibility, however, is that this
shared interaction site plays a role in coordinating molecular
events on chromosomes. If WDR5 is viewed as the central player
in this process, it is easy to imagine how a chromatin-bound
molecule of WDR5 could be a docking site for various proteins at a
ﬁxed genomic location. By depositing WDR5 at speciﬁc points on
chromatin, and by employing mutually exclusive interactions,
cells could tie speciﬁc molecular functions together in a way that
allows coordination between them. For example, completion of a
catalytic cycle by an MLL complex may trigger a transient dissociation of the complex (16), creating the opportunity for MYC to
access WDR5 and be stably recruited to chromatin only after
H3K4 methylation is safely deposited. Alternatively, MYC may
actively disrupt chromatin-bound MLL complexes by displacing
RBBP5 from WDR5, simultaneously binding its target genes and
inhibiting further H3K4 methylation at these sites. It is interesting
to note that MYC has been found to trigger transient and localized
histone H3K4 demethylation upon binding target genes (17), and

Thomas et al.

that this process leads to recruitment of additional proteins
required for gene activation by MYC. By extension, we imagine
that exchanges between resident WDR5 and its various interaction
partners could be part of a cycle that not only brings MYC to
chromatin but establishes an ordered series of events that prime
the locus for enhanced transcription.
Key to understanding how WDR5 exerts its inﬂuence over MYC
is to characterize the molecular context in which the two proteins
associate and to learn how WDR5 itself is tethered to chromatin.
Biochemical puriﬁcation of the relevant MYC–WDR5 complex,
and identiﬁcation of proteins that associate with MYC via WDR5,
will reveal whether MYC interacts with a novel WDR5-containing
complex, or whether it is capable of disrupting MLL (or NSL)
complexes.
Understanding how WDR5 is recruited to or retained at MYC
target genes, however, may be more challenging. Besides its role in
the MLL and NSL complexes, WDR5 is an epigenetic "reader,"
capable of binding histone H3 tails marked by K4 dimethylation
(10), symmetric arginine 2 dimethylation (18), and threonine 11
phosphorylation (19). Like many WD40-repeat proteins, WDR5
can also associate with ubiquitin (20), a frequent modiﬁcation of
histones. And it can be recruited to speciﬁc sites on chromatin by
long noncoding RNAs (21), which interestingly bind to the same
cleft in WDR5 as MYC/RBBP5/KANSL2 (22). Compounded by
the fact that WDR5 could be brought to different regions of
chromatin by different mechanisms, distilling the mechanisms
of target gene selectivity by WDR5, and how it relates to MYC,
could take some time. However, it should be possible to combine
biochemical and genetic methods with approaches such as chromatin immunoprecipitation to learn how WDR5 is recruited to
select genes and use this information to build a global view of
WDR5-targeting mechanisms.

Therapeutic Implications
The utility of MYC proteins as targets for anticancer therapies is
well established (2), and the impact of bioavailable small-molecule MYC inhibitors on cancer treatment options would likely be
profound. A recent breakthrough was achieved with a class of
compounds known as BET bromodomain inhibitors (2), which
act against a family of proteins required for expression of MYC
genes in certain cell types. Although promising, these compounds
are limited to situations where MYC expression is driven by BET
bromodomain proteins. Targeting some property of the MYC
protein itself may be expected to have broader utility, but this has
proven difﬁcult. MYC is largely unstructured in solution. Detailed
understanding of how it associates with key partner proteins is
scant, and restricted primarily to MAX. Although MAX is the most
highly validated and crucial MYC interaction partner, drug-discovery efforts here are limited because of the extensive nature of
the MYC–MAX interface, and because each protein is unstructured

in the absence of the other, making structure–activity relationships difﬁcult to pursue.
The identiﬁcation of WDR5 as a cofactor for MYC presents a
new target for drug discovery that is theoretically much more
tractable. The MYC–WDR5 interface is small, relatively weak,
and structurally well deﬁned. WDR5 is a compact protein
whose structure is not signiﬁcantly altered when bound to
MYC. These unique properties of WDR5 and the way it associates with MYC make it possible to shift the focus of drugdiscovery efforts away from MYC and onto WDR5, via identiﬁcation of small molecules that tightly associate with the MYCbinding cleft in WDR5. If the facilitated recruitment model is
correct, such small molecules would be expected to chemically
recapitulate the effects of point mutations in the EEIDVV motif
of MYC (5), preventing its stable association with chromatin
and disabling its tumorigenic properties.
The concept that WDR5 could be used as a platform to
discover MYC inhibitors is exciting, but also raises a number
of key questions that will need to be answered before their true
potential can be realized. It is essential to know the extent to
which MYC and WDR5 work together in different malignancies,
to know which cancers may beneﬁt from MYC–WDR5 inhibitors. It is important to determine whether association of WDR5
with MYC is required for tumor maintenance, as opposed to
initiation, to reveal whether such inhibitors would have any
utility for the treatment of preexisting cancers. And careful
consideration has to be given to the prospect of whether a
therapeutic window for such inhibitors could be established, in
which the activity of MYC can be reduced to a sufﬁcient extent
without sacriﬁcing the normal, essential, functions of WDR5.
This is a particularly relevant concern because it is difﬁcult to
envision a MYC–WDR5 inhibitor that would not also disrupt
the WDR5–RBBP5 and WDR5–KANSL2 interactions. The only
way to really know whether chemically inhibiting the MYC–
WDR5 interaction can lead to a selective and useful therapeutic
agent is by discovering and developing the inhibitors themselves. Fortunately, growing recognition of the protumorigenic
properties of WDR5 (23), and its value as anticancer drug target
(24), provides impetus for discovering small molecules that
bind key interaction surfaces on WDR5, such as the MYC/
RBBP5/KANSL2–binding cleft, with the prospect that they will
have anticancer activity in some setting. It seems likely, therefore, that chemical matter will be available soon to interrogate
the true therapeutic potential of targeting the MYC–WDR5
nexus.
