Abstract
High-throughput and high-content databases are increasingly important resources in molecular medicine,
systems biology, and pharmacology. However, the information usually resides in unwieldy databases, limiting ready
data analysis and integration. One resource that offers substantial potential for improvement in this regard is the
NCI-60 cell line database compiled by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, which has been extensively characterized
across numerous genomic and pharmacologic response platforms. In this report, we introduce a CellMiner (http://
discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/) web application designed to improve the use of this extensive database. CellMiner
tools allowed rapid data retrieval of transcripts for 22,379 genes and 360 microRNAs along with activity reports for
20,503 chemical compounds including 102 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Converting
these differential levels into quantitative patterns across the NCI-60 clariﬁed data organization and crosscomparisons using a novel pattern match tool. Data queries for potential relationships among parameters can
be conducted in an iterative manner speciﬁc to user interests and expertise. Examples of the in silico discovery
process afforded by CellMiner were provided for multidrug resistance analyses and doxorubicin activity; identiﬁcation of colon-speciﬁc genes, microRNAs, and drugs; microRNAs related to the miR-17-92 cluster; and drug
identiﬁcation patterns matched to erlotinib, geﬁtinib, afatinib, and lapatinib. CellMiner greatly broadens applications of the extensive NCI-60 database for discovery by creating web-based processes that are rapid, ﬂexible, and
readily applied by users without bioinformatics expertise. Cancer Res; 72(14); 3499–511. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Access to bioinformatics frequently acts as a choke point in
the ﬂow of information between large-scale technologies and
the researchers who have the expertise to assess the data.
Difﬁculty in ﬂuid data access leads to restricted ability to
integrate diverse data types, reducing understanding of complex biologic and pharmacologic systems. One such large-scale
information set with multiple genomic and drug response
platforms is the NCI-60 cancer cell line database. These cell
lines, due to the extensive pharmacology and genomic data
available, are prime candidates for data integration and broad
public access.
The NCI-60 cell line panel was initially developed as an anticancer drug efﬁcacy screen by the Developmental Therapeu-

tics Program (DTP; http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/) of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). Many thousands of compounds have
been and continue to be applied to the NCI-60 (1, 2). In parallel,
multiple platforms have been used to characterize the cells
including (i) array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH;
ref. 3) and karyotypic analysis (4), (ii) DNA mutational analysis (5), (iii) DNA ﬁngerprinting (6), (iv) microarrays for
transcript expression (7–9), (v) microarrays for microRNA
expression (9, 10), and (vi) protein reverse-phase lysate microarrays (11).
An emphasis within our group is integration and openaccess dissemination of molecular biology and molecular
pharmacology information. One form of data integration we
have developed over the last several years is the combination
of multiple transcript microarray platforms. This integration
saves time by preventing researchers from having to review
data from each platform individually and improves the
accuracy and reliability of the results. Starting with a 3platform integration (12), we next tested the use of z-score
averages for probes to facilitate integration of results of
different platforms done at different times (13). A z-score is a
mathematical transformation that for each probe measurement, for example, ABCB1 gene expression across the NCI60, subtracts the mean (to center the data) and then divides
by the SD (to normalize the range). This approach has
recently been expanded to integrate 5 platforms (14) and

has proven to be both reliable and informative (15–18). Here,
we show this approach can be adopted for the DTP drug
activity as well.
In the current study, we introduce for noninformaticists a
set of web-based tools accessible through our CellMiner web
application (19) that allows rapid access to and comparison
of transcript expression levels of 22,379 genes, 360 microRNAs, and 20,503 compounds including 102 Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. The tools allow easy
identiﬁcation of drugs with similar activity proﬁles across
the NCI-60. The gene and drug assessments, having been
derived from widely varying numbers of probes or experiments, include all probe or experimental results that pass
quality control, allowing the assessment of data reliability. In
addition, we introduce our Pattern Comparison tool, which
rapidly searches for robust connections between these parameters, as well as any independent pattern of interest, and
allows the user to mine data not only for speciﬁc genes or
drugs but also for systems biology and systems pharmacology investigations.

Materials and Methods
Quantitation of gene transcript expression levels in the
NCI-60 using ﬁve microarray platforms
Transcript expression for each gene was determined
through the integration of all pertinent probes from ﬁve platforms. From Affymetrix (Affymetrix Inc.), we used the Human
Genome U95 Set (HG-U95, GEO accession GSE5949; ref. 8); the
Human Genome U133 (HG-U133, GEO accession GSE5720;
ref. 8); the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (HG-U133
Plus 2.0, GEO accession GSE32474; ref. 13); and the GeneChip
Human Exon 1.0 ST array (GH Exon 1.0 ST, GEO accession
GSE29682; ref. 14). From Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Inc.),
we used the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (WHG,
GEO accession GSE29288; ref. 9). Affymetrix microarrays were
normalized by GCRMA (20). All WHG mRNA probes detected
in at least 10% of cell lines were normalized using GeneSpring
GX by (i) setting gProcessedSignal values less than 5 to 5, (ii)
transforming gProcessedSignal or gTotalGeneSignal to log2,
and (iii) normalizing per array to the 75th percentile (9). Data
for these microarrays are accessible at our web-based data

retrieval and integration tool, CellMiner (http://discover.nci.
nih.gov/cellminer/; ref. 19). Affymetrix probe sets are referred
to as probes for ease of description within the manuscript.
Quality control for genes is done as follows. For every probe
for that gene, the intensity range across the NCI-60 is determined, and all probes with a range of 1.2 log2 are dropped.
The number of probes that pass this criterion is determined
and 25% of that number calculated (keeping a minimum of 2
and a maximum of 253). For the remaining probes, Pearson
correlations are determined for all probe/probe combinations.
The average correlation for each probe is determined compared with all other (remaining) probes. Probes whose average
correlations are less than 0.30 (P < 0.02 for 60 cell lines in the
absence of multiple comparisons correction) and not correlated to any other individual probes at 0.30 are dropped. The
average correlation for remaining probes is then recalculated.
Next, for probes with average correlations less than 0.60 (P <
0.0000004 for 60 cell lines), the lowest of these are dropped, and
average correlations recalculated for all remaining probe
combinations. Probes are dropped until either all are 0.60
or the 25% (of probes that passed the 1.2 log2 range criteria)
level is reached. This ensures signiﬁcant pattern match across
probes.
Probe intensity values that pass these quality controls are
transformed to z-scores (21). Average z-scores were determined
for each gene for each cell line. Probes with only one experiment that passes the 1.2 log2 range test are included as they are
potentially informative but must be considered less reliable.
Quantitation of drug and compound activity levels
Drug activity levels expressed as 50% growth-inhibitory
levels (GI50) are determined by the DTP (http://dtp.nci.nih.
gov/) at 48 hours using the sulforhodamine B assay (22). Repeat
experiments must pass quality control criteria, similar to those
for gene transcript levels. Experiments with range less than 1.2
log10 or with information on less than 35 cell lines are dropped.
This serves to eliminate nonresponsive and out of proper range
data. The number of experiments that pass these criteria is
determined and 25% of that number calculated (keeping a
minimum of 2 and a maximum of 253). Pearson correlations
are determined for all remaining possible experiment/experiment combinations. Experiments whose average correlations
are less than 0.334 (P < 0.05 for the 35 cell line minimum in the
absence of multiple comparisons correction) and were not
correlated to individual probes at 0.334 are dropped. For the
remaining experiments with average correlations less than 0.60
(P < 0.00014 for the 35 cell line minimum), the lowest is
dropped, and the correlations recalculated for all remaining
possible experiment/experiment combinations. Experiments
are dropped in this fashion until either all are 0.60 or the 25%
(of experiments that passed the 1.2 log2 range criteria) level is
reached. This ensures signiﬁcant pattern match across experiments. Drugs with only one experiment but that pass the 1.2
log10 range test are included as output as they are potentially
informative but must be considered less reliable. For the
purpose of the manuscript, compounds that have not yet
undergone clinical trials, as well as those that have, will
sometimes be referred to as drugs.

MicroRNA expression levels
MicroRNA expression levels were determined as described
previously (9) for the Agilent Technologies 15k feature Human
miRNA Microarray (V2) following the manufacturer's recommendations and are available at CellMiner (http://discover.nci.
nih.gov/cellminer/) as well as at GEO (accession GSE22821).
Pattern comparisons
The comparisons of gene transcript expression, microRNA
expression, and drug activity across the NCI-60 use the data
prepared as described in the previous 3 sections. Pearson
correlations between these parameters were calculated using
Java 5.0.

Results
Web-based bioinformatics tool access for the NCI-60
Several important forms of bioinformatics analyses, made to
be easily accessible for the noninformaticist, are now available
at the Genomics and Bioinformatics Group's CellMiner (http://
discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/) site (Fig. 1A). To access those,
click the "NCI-60 Analysis Tools" tab. These tools (Fig. 1B) allow
the user to rapidly obtain information for the NCI-60 that
would otherwise require lengthy data retrieval, compilation,
and assessment. Included are data for relative transcript and
microRNA levels, as well as drug activity. The tools include
pattern comparison functionality that enables the identiﬁcation of relationships between these and other parameters, as
driven by the user's interest.
In each case (Fig. 1B), users select the tool in step 1.
Identiﬁers or patterns are typed in if one chooses "Input list,"
or uploaded as a .txt or .xls ﬁle if "Upload ﬁle" is chosen in step 2.
Next, users enter their e-mail address for receipt of the data in
step 3, and click "Get data" to receive data (as an Excel ﬁle).
Data are generally available within a few minutes. Error ﬁles are
returned if no results are provided, stating the reason. These
tools are described with examples in the subsequent ﬁgures.
Relative transcript levels tool
To obtain high-deﬁnition, easily interpretable transcriptlevel data, select the "Z score determination" tool and "Gene
transcript level" shown in step 1 of Fig. 2A. Check "Input list"
and input your gene of interest in step 2 (Fig. 2A and B). Ofﬁcial
gene names are required [(see the Human Genome Organization, HUGO (http://www.genenames.org)]. In the example,
ABCB1 is the HUGO name of the gene encoding the P-glycoprotein MDR (P-gp) drug efﬂux transporter. The tool compiles
all probe information available for the selected gene from 5
microarray platforms, the Affymetrix HG-U95, HG-133, HGU133 Plus 2.0, and the GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST array.
Quality control is included on the basis of single probe variation, as well as probe-to-probe correlation to eliminate poor
quality, dead, or background-level probes.
The tool output includes relative transcript intensity presented as z-scores and visualized as a bar graph (Fig. 2C). The
bars for each cell line are color-coded by tissue of origin.
Parameters of the Affymetrix probe intensities (range, minimum, maximum, average, and SD) are included (Fig. 2D) to
provide an untransformed reﬂection of transcript-level

variation. Chromosomal location is also included (Fig. 2D). In
the example shown in Fig. 2C, NCI-ADR-RES and HCT-15 are
the top 2 expressers of ABCB1. Notably, most cell lines appear
to the left of the mean with uniformly low values. Those low
values all approach 2.79 log2 intensity units (Fig. 2D), which is
within background and indicates that all those cell lines have
undetectable or low ABCB1 transcript levels.
In each data ﬁle for individual genes, the user also receives (i)
the total number of probes for the gene (including those that
failed), (ii) all intensity values (for those probes that passed
quality control) to a maximum of 122, (iii) the z-score transforms for each probe, (iv) the platform that each probe
originated from, (v) the exon to which the probe hybridizes,
(vi) the average z-score for each cell line, and (vii) the distribution of the individual cell line average intensities presented
as a histogram. Currently information on 22,379 genes is
available.
The "Z score determination" tool also allows multiple gene
entries in the input box (Fig. 2B; with each gene on a separate
line). Each gene is then returned as separate Excel ﬁle with its
own plots and data. In the case of multiple genes being entered,
a cross-correlation table of the resultant z-scores can be
generated by clicking the "Include Cross-correlations" box
in Fig. 2A, step 1.
Relative drug activities tool
To obtain curated GI50 data (50% growth inhibition), select
the "Z score determination" tool shown in Fig. 1A (top right)
and then select "Drug activity" Specify the compound using the
National Service Center number (NSC) as the input (Fig. 2E, the
NSC of doxorubicin is 123127). This tool will compile all
experimental information available from the DTP (http://
dtp.nci.nih.gov/) for the selected compound(s). Quality control
is included on the basis of single experiment variation as well as
experiment-to-experiment correlation to eliminate out of
appropriate concentration, weak or invariant response, and
irreproducible experiments. The compound must have a minimum of 35 cell lines with activity information to be included.
The tool output includes relative compound activity presented
as z-scores and visualized as a bar graph (Fig. 2F). Parameters
of the compound activities (range, minimum, maximum, average, and SD) are included (Fig. 2G) to provide the user with an
untransformed reﬂection of compound activity. The distribution of the individual cell line average responses is presented as
a histogram. In the example shown, NCI-ADR-RES and HCT-15
are the two cell lines most resistant to doxorubicin in the NCI60, which is consistent with the fact they overexpress ABCB1,
whose gene product P-gp pumps the drug from the cell (23, 24).

In the case of multiple drugs being entered, a cross-correlation
table of the resultant z-scores for each drug may also be
generated by clicking the "Include Cross-correlations" box
in Figs. 2A and 1B, step 1.
The user also receives (i) the total number of experiments
done for the compound (including those that failed), (ii)
whether the compound has been FDA-approved, (iii) all activity values (for those experiments that passed quality control, to
a maximum of 253), (iv) the z-score transforms for each
experiment, and (v) the average z-score for each cell line.
Currently, 50,703 compounds have passed through these
ﬁlters, resulting in data for 20,503 compounds. NSC numbers
are the required input (download the list of currently available
NSCs at "List of NSC numbers available for analysis"; Fig. 1B).
NSC numbers can be cross-referenced to other identifying
parameters, including their chemical structures (http://dtp.
nci.nih.gov/dtpstandard/dwindex/index.jsp).
Relative microRNA levels tool
To rapidly obtain the log2 intensity values for microRNAs,
the "microRNA mean centered graphs" tool is selected as
shown in step 1 of Fig. 3A. Input your microRNA(s) of interest
in step 2 using the name from the provided "List of microRNA
identiﬁers available for analysis" accessed by clicking
[download] in Step 1. The microRNA tool provides access to
the average log2 intensity values for the Agilent Technologies
Human miRNA Microarray (V2; ref. 9). The z-scores are not
used as this is a single platform analysis done at a single time.
The tool output includes relative transcript intensities visualized as a bar graph. In the example shown in Fig. 3B, we queried
the data for a microRNA from the miR-17-92 oncogenic cluster
(25). Other microRNAs from the same cluster showed the same
pattern of expression, with high levels in leukemia and colon
cancer lines (data not shown; see Discussion). Parameters of
probe intensities (range, minimum, maximum, average, and
SD), as well as the chromosomal location are included (Fig. 3C).
The distribution of the individual cell line average intensities is
presented as a histogram. Currently information on 360 microRNAs is available.
Pattern comparison tools
To make comparisons between an input pattern of interest (including expression of a gene or microRNA, activity of a
drug, or any pattern of interest) and (i) gene expression, (ii)
microRNA expression, and (iii) drug activity levels, start by
selecting the "Pattern comparison" tool shown in step 1
of Fig. 4A, and 1 of the 4 possible types of input, "Gene
symbol," "microRNA," "Drug NSC#," or "Pattern in 60 element

genes or drugs entered may be included by checking the "Include Cross-correlations" check box. In step 2, the user chooses whether to type in the input or
upload it as a ﬁle by selecting "Input list" or "Upload ﬁle" (as .txt or .xls, respectively). B, for relative transcript expression levels, input the gene
name(s) using the "ofﬁcial" (HUGO) name. C, a graphical z-score composite of all transcript probes that pass quality control is generated, along with the
numerical values (data not shown). D. mean log2 intensity values for range, minimum, maximum, average, and SD for all Affymetrix probes are
included to assist in data interpretation, as well as chromosomal location. E, for relative drug activity levels, input the drug "ofﬁcial" NSC number(s)
(see "Download NSCs" ﬁle from Fig. 1B, step 1, for a listing of these). F, a graphical z-score composite of all drug experiments that pass quality control is
generated, along with the numerical values (data not shown). G, mean log10 intensity values for range, minimum, maximum, average, and SD for all
experiments are included to assist in data interpretation, as well as a histogram of the cell lines average activities. For the histogram, the x-axis is the average
experiment activity for the cell lines and the y-axis the frequency at which they occur. The red arrow indicates the most resistant cell line to doxorubicin,

Bioinformatics of the NCI-60

array." Input your identiﬁer(s) in step 2, using a gene,
microRNA, drug, or pattern. The ﬁrst 3 of these are the
same 22,379 gene expression levels, 20,503 drugs activity
levels, and 360 microRNA expression levels, described above
(see Figs. 1–3). The fourth option is to input any pattern
across the NCI-60 that is of interest to the user. A "Pattern
comparison template ﬁle" for this option is accessible for
download in step 1, footnote 3 (Fig. 4A).
The output is returned as a single Excel spreadsheet ﬁle
that includes 6 main sections: "All" and "Signiﬁcant gene
correlations" (Fig. 4B), "All" and "Signiﬁcant microRNA correlations" (Fig. 4C), and "All" and "Signiﬁcant drug correlations" (Fig. 4D; the 3 All columns are not shown in B–D). The
top and bottom portions of these sets from the input of
ABCB1 are shown in Fig. 4. The "all" versions of these outputs
contain the same columns as do the "signiﬁcant," with the
exception of the FDA status column in Fig. 4D but include all
possible correlations and are in either alphabetical (for
genes and microRNAs) or numerical (for drugs by NSC
number) order. The signiﬁcant correlations outputs, are
based on statistical signiﬁcance (P < 0.05) in the absence
of multiple comparisons correction and are ordered by
descending correlations with color-coding (red- and bluebold fonts for positive and negative signiﬁcant correlations,
respectively). The data used for the correlation calculations
for the genes, drugs, and microRNAs are those generated in
the gene transcript level, drug activity, and microRNA tools
in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Information included for the
genes sections will be Gene Ontology annotations accessed
from the mAdb (https://madb.nci.nih.gov) database (see the
Annotations column, Fig. 4B), as well as the chromosomal
locations for the signiﬁcant correlations section (see the
Location column, Fig. 4B). Gene names for the signiﬁcant
correlations section are hyperlinked to GeneCards (http://
www.genecards.org). Information included for the signiﬁcant correlations microRNA section is the chromosomal
locations of the microRNAs (see the Location column, Fig.
4C). microRNA names for the signiﬁcant correlations section
are hyperlinked to miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org). Information included for the drug sections are name (where
available, see the Name column, Fig. 4D), mechanism of
action (for 355 drugs currently, see the Mechanism
column, Fig. 4D), and for the signiﬁcantly correlated section,
the FDA approval status (see the FDA status column, Fig.
4D). A footnotes page is included with the output to provide
details on the deﬁnitions, approaches, abbreviations, and
background.
Additional uses of the pattern tools (starting with a predeﬁned pattern or a given drug) are presented as examples in
the Discussion (see Figs. 5 and 6).

Discussion
The sheer quantity of data generated by current highthroughput platforms have encumbered their use and access.
However, because of the emergence of new "omic" technologies
and the questions to be asked in dealing with issues of human
disease, it is extremely important to open such data to clinicians, molecular biologists, and others with insights into
aspects of disease. This is clearly the case in the difﬁcult and
complex case of cancer.
Our web-based tools provide assistance in this area for the
NCI-60. They allow rapid determination of (i) a composite "best"
gene transcript expression level pattern from 5 microarray
platforms, (ii) drug activity from all experimental repeats done
by the DTP, and (iii) transcript levels of microRNAs from duplicate microarrays (ref. 9; Figs. 2 and 3). The "Pattern comparison"
tools (Figs. 4–6) allow rapid, global exploration of relationships
between these parameters and any input pattern of interest.
This accession of relative levels of transcript expression (Fig.
2C) provides several advantages. The tool (i) compiles all
probes for a single gene, (ii) incorporates built-in quality
control, and (iii) includes probe remapping based on HG-19,
eliminating the need to spend time or have expertise in those
areas. Allowing the user to see the input probes for a single gene
allows assessment of reliability and accuracy. For example, an
expression pattern for a gene with 46 highly correlated probes
(as is the case for ABCB1 in Fig. 2C) shows both high reliability
and accuracy. Conversely, a gene with 2 probes that barely pass
quality control should be considered both less reliable and
accurate. Availability of reliable patterns of relative transcript
expression in turn facilitates comparison with other data, such
as drug activity and microRNA expression. For ABCB1 and
doxorubicin (Fig. 2), there is obvious correlation between high
ABCB1 expression and doxorubicin resistance, consistent with
prior results (23, 24).
During development of the tools derived for gene transcript
z-score patterns, we have validated and exploited them to
elucidate novel gene regulation mechanisms for MYC, TOP1,
and CHEK2 (15–17). The cross-correlation function illustrated
in Fig. 2A, step1, identiﬁed transcriptional coregulation among
kinetochore genes (17) and across genes driving cell migration
and adhesion (26).
That regulatory elements may be identiﬁed using these tools
is shown by the example of the cell–cell adhesion factor CDH1
(E-cadherin). Using the pattern comparison tool with CDH1 as
input, one ﬁnds that each of transcriptional repressors ZEB1
(TCF8), SNAI2 (SLUG), ZEB2 (SIP1), and TWIST1 has signiﬁcant
negative correlation to CDH1 transcript levels, at 0.63, 0.47,
0.37, and 0.47, respectively. These repressors have been
reported previously to negatively regulate CDH1 (27–31). In

Figure 5. Pattern comparison example for a colon-speciﬁc input pattern. The input for this analysis consisted of 1 for all non-colon cell lines and 5 for all colon.
The 3 forms of output described in Fig. 4, genes, microRNAs, and drugs, are shown. The top 3 genes by correlation are shown in tabular fashion.
Bar graphs for 2 of the genes, generated as described in Fig. 2, display the data visually. The top 2 microRNAs by correlation are shown next in graphical
fashion, generated as described in Fig. 3. The top 3 drugs with either the FDA-approved or clinical trials by correlation and one clinically untested
compound are shown in tabular fashion. Bar graphs for 2 of these, generated as described in Fig. 2, are displayed. The red star in all cases indicates
prior literature association with colon cancer.

selected for "Gene transcript level". B, the top 6 rows of the signiﬁcant drug correlations output from the "Pattern comparison" tool, identifying 2 other

addition, they show robust positive correlations to hsa-miR200c, -200a, -200b, -200b , and -200a , with values of 0.73, 0.59,
0.55, 0.48, and 0.41, respectively. The microRNA-200 family has
been previously associated with E-cadherin regulation through
ZEB1 and ZEB2 targeting (32, 33).
The microRNA mean-centered graph tool (Fig. 3A and B)
simply provides raw data and mean-centered graphical representation of the data determined previously (9). In the example
shown, miR-18a exhibits notable speciﬁcities for colon and

especially leukemia cell lines. miR-18a has previously been
shown to be part of a polycistronic oncogenic microRNA
cluster, which includes 6 consecutive mature microRNAs,
miR-17, -18a, -19a, -19b, -20a, and -92a co-expressed as a single
primary transcript (25, 34). Notably, the pattern comparison
tool for miR-18a retrieves the 5 other microRNAs at the top of
the signiﬁcantly correlated microRNA list (with Pearson correlation coefﬁcients between 0.96 and 0.77) and MYC ranked
37th in the gene list with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.61. The

MYC correlation is consistent with the fact that the miR-17-92
cluster is a transcriptional MYC target (35).
The ability to rapidly compare patterns of transcript
expression, microRNA expression, and drug activity (Figs.
2 and 3) both with themselves and other patterns of interest
provides a powerful and ﬂexible tool to the user. The tool
automatically (i) allows the input of multiple types of data,
(ii) calculates the correlation to 3 types of data, and (iii)
identiﬁes those correlations that are statistically signiﬁcant.
Allowing the user to see the correlation level and order in
which genes, microRNAs, or compounds are ranked for any
single input provides criteria by which to identify potential
relationships between disparate parameters and to access
the robustness of these relationships. Of the named drugs
in Fig. 4D other than doxorubicin, romidepsin (FK228) has
previously been shown to undergo efﬂux by ABCB1 (36) and
bouvardin to have cross-resistance with doxorubicin (37). To
the best of our knowledge, chromomycin had not been
previously associated with ABCB1. Signiﬁcant microRNA
expression versus gene expression, gene expression versus
drug activity, and microRNA expression versus drug activity
correlations have previously been identiﬁed in this fashion
(14, 17).
A novel example is provided in Fig. 5, in which a colonspeciﬁc pattern is entered into the pattern comparison tool.
The input was 1 for all non-colon cell lines and 5 for all colon
cell lines. The top 3 genes from the signiﬁcant gene correlations output are shown. The top gene, TRIM15, is a little
studied tripartite motif family gene, but its high correlation
(0.901) to the colon-speciﬁc input makes it a candidate for
being a colon cancer–speciﬁc marker. RNF43 is an ubiquitin
ligase known to be upregulated in colon cancer (38). VIL1 is
an actin-binding protein previously identiﬁed as a diagnostic
marker for colon cancer (39). The bar graphs for VIL1 and
RNF43, derived from the "Z score determination" tool (Fig. 2)
illustrate their colon speciﬁcity. The bar plots for the top 2
microRNAs from the signiﬁcant microRNA correlations are
shown next. Both miR-215 and -194 (with correlations of
0.745 and 0.739, respectively) have previously been described
as prognostic indicators for colorectal cancer (40, 41). The
bar graphs, from the "microRNA mean centered graphs" tool
from Fig. 3, illustrate their colon speciﬁcity. Four of the top 7
drugs from the signiﬁcant drug correlations list are also
shown. Of these, 3 have some clinical trial history. Pyrazoloacridine has been tested in colon cancer with modest
success (42). Selumetinib (AZD6244) has been proposed as
a potential therapy for colorectal cancer (43). From our bar
graph, it appears to have speciﬁcity for melanoma in addition to colon cancers. Sunitinib is in clinical trial for colorectal cancer (44). The additional compound presented as a
bar graph, NSC732298, has better speciﬁcity for colon that
any of these (r ¼ 0.653) but has not gone through clinical
trials. The bar graphs for selumetinib and 732298 from the "Z
score determination" tool from Fig. 2 illustrate their level of
colon speciﬁcity. Together, these genes, microRNAs, and
drugs illustrate how one can, from a single pattern input,
rapidly obtain multiple types of both known and novel
information relevant to a users' area of interest.

The ability to access relative drug activity levels and patterns
(Fig. 2F) provides advantages similar to those for relative
transcript levels. The tool automatically (i) compiles all experiments for a single drug from all experiments done and (ii)
incorporates quality control into the approach. It allows the
user to see the input experiments, allowing assessment of
reliability and accuracy. This is especially important for the
activity data, as there are many compounds with small numbers of experiments and some with reduced numbers of cell
lines tested. An example of a highly reliable activity pattern is
that for doxorubicin, which has 253 highly correlated experiments (Fig. 2F). The identiﬁcation of a reliable pattern of
relative compound activity facilitates its comparison with
other types of data. Drug patterns derived in this fashion have
been used previously for comparison with mRNA and microRNA expression (14).
A ﬁnal example of the ﬂexibility of the new tools is
depicted in Fig. 6. As illustrated, the pattern comparison
tools can be readily adapted to do COMPARE-like (1, 45)
drug analyses, in which the user can query the 20,503 drugs
and chemicals from the DTP database to identify similar
drugs. In Fig. 6, the input is erlotinib (NSC 718781), an
inhibitor of the EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. Pleasingly, the 2 other FDA-approved EGFR-targeted drugs geﬁtinib and lapatinib ranked ﬁfth and sixth, and afatinib
(BIBW2992), which is in advanced clinical trials and also
targets EGFR-ERB kinase, ranked third among the 20,503
drugs (Fig. 6B). Compound 693255, which ranked second is a
tyrphostin derivative, a class of drugs shown to inhibit
tyrosine kinase including EGFR (46). The plots shown
in Fig. 6C were obtained using the z-score tool (see Fig.
2F). They show pattern similarity among the 4 highly correlated drugs. Conversely, the piperidinium compounds
(618757, 636676, 638634, and 630602 with r ¼ 0.587,
0.536, 0.532, and 0.504, respectively) have consistently
high inverse correlation. That is, they work well when the
EGFR inhibitors work poorly. This example illustrates the
usefulness of tools in the comparison of drugs with similar
mechanisms of action, including those that are in clinical
development (such as afatinib), as well as identifying novel
compounds that either might work in a similar fashion, or
are inverse to it.
The ease, rapidity, and ﬂexibility of the new tools provide
users with an important new data integration capacity.
One of our goals is to update and enhance these tools in
an ongoing fashion. Our next 2 additional tools will be the
Comparative Genomic Hybridization tool and database
(aCGH), which will assist in interpretation of DNA copy
number using our Roche NimbleGen 385k CGH array,
and the Whole Exome Sequencing tool and database (WES),
which will provide access to the whole genome sequences
for all exons across the NCI-60 (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/
cellminer/). Together, these databases and tools provide
publicly available and unique opportunities for systems
biology and systems pharmacology investigations.
