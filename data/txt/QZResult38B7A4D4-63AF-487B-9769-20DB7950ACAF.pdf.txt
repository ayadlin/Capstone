ABSTRACT
Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
(cisplatin,
cDDP)
is
an
effective
chemotherapeutic agent that induces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), primarily
in replicating cells. Generally, such DSBs can be repaired by the classical or backup
non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ/b-NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR).
Therefore, inhibiting these pathways in cancer cells should enhance the efficiency of
cDDP treatments. Indeed, inhibition of HR by hyperthermia (HT) sensitizes cancer
cells to cDDP and in the Netherlands this combination is a standard treatment option
for recurrent cervical cancer after previous radiotherapy. Additionally, cDDP has been
demonstrated to disrupt c-NHEJ, which likely further increases the treatment efficacy.
However, if one of these pathways is blocked, DSB repair functions can be sustained
by the Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase1 (PARP1)-dependent b-NHEJ. Therefore,
disabling b-NHEJ should, in principle, further inhibit the repair of cDDP-induced DNA
lesions and enhance the toxicity of thermochemotherapy. To explore this hypothesis,
we treated a panel of cancer cell lines with HT, cDDP and a PARP1-i and measured
various end-point relevant in cancer treatment. Our results demonstrate that PARP1-i
does not considerably increase the efficacy of HT combined with standard, commonly
used cDDP concentrations. However, in the presence of a PARP1-i, ten-fold lower
concentration of cDDP can be used to induce similar cytotoxic effects. PARP1 inhibition
may thus permit a substantial lowering of cDDP concentrations without diminishing
treatment efficacy, potentially reducing systemic side effects.

INTRODUCTION

induce DNA single and double strand breaks (SSBs and
DSBs) in replicating cells [3, 4]. The accumulation of
unrepaired DNA lesions, particularly DSBs, can lead
to cell death. In mammalian cells, DSBs are repaired by
mainly two major pathways: the classical non-homologous
end joining (c-NHEJ) and the homologous recombination
(HR). HR is mainly active in S- and G2-phase, ensures
accurate repair by using the undamaged sister chromatid

Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), cDDP),
is one of the most potent and widely used chemotherapeutic
agents. cDDP has been successfully applied in treating
many different tumor types, including head and neck,
lung, testis, ovarian, cervix and breast [1, 2]. cDDP induces
formation of intra- and interstrand crosslinks, which may

as a template and involves, among others, BRCA2 and
RAD51 [5]. Mild hyperthermia (HT), 1 h at 41–42.5°C, can
disrupt this pathway temporarily by inducing degradation
of BRCA2 and preventing the recruitment of RAD51 to
DSBs [6]. c-NHEJ is active in all cell cycle phases, rejoins
the break ends without the requirement for homologous
template and is therefore considered to be more error prone
[7–9]. Besides inducing DNA breaks, cDDP has also been
shown to disrupt c-NHEJ [10–13].
The combination of cDDP and HT has been shown
to be an effective clinical modality and is the standard
treatment for previously irradiated patients with recurrent
cervical cancer in the Netherlands [14]. Nevertheless,
commonly used dose of cDDP can be very toxic for
a substantial percentage of patients due to sometimes
irreversible neural toxicity (hearing loss, numbness and
tingling of the extremities) and kidney failure [15, 16].
Kidney failure is particularly dreaded in women with
advanced cervical cancer in whom kidney function is
already impaired by renal obstruction due to the tumor.
Therefore, a large number of patients would benefit
it the required dose of cDDP could be reduced without
compromising tumor control.
Tumor resistance to cDDP plus HT may not only
be explained by an insufficient cDDP dose, but also
by the existence of a third DNA-repair pathway, socalled back-up NHEJ (b-NHEJ), which becomes active
when either or both c-NHEJ and HR are impaired [17].
Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase1 (PARP1) is essential
for functioning of b-NHEJ [18, 19], and at least partly
explains the accumulation of DSBs. Additional benefits
of this approach may come from the observations that
PARP1 plays a crucial role in regulating replication fork
progression. Collapsed replication forks caused by a
PARP1-i are converted to DSBs and require HR for repair
[20]. In HR deficient cells, including cells harboring
inactivation mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and cells
suffering from a HT-induced BRCA2 degradation, such
lesions become highly cytotoxic in what can be considered
a form of synthetic lethality [6, 20–24]. Importantly,
PARP1 inhibitors have already been in multiple clinical
trials in BRCA negative breast and ovarian cancers, and
generally show favorable clinical profile [25, 26].
Here we set out to test, in vitro, whether the efficacy
of cDDP+HT modality can benefit from the inhibition
of PARP1. We focused on two interrelated aspects of
such therapeutic strategy. First, we investigated whether
PARP1-i can enhance the cytotoxicity of the standard
cDDP+HT regimen. Second, we asked whether addition
of PARP1-i can allow significant reduction of the overall
cDDP dose, while maintaining the cytotoxic potential
of the treatment. This is a clinically relevant question,
particularly in the case that inhibition of PARP1 does not
significantly alter the efficacy of HT when combined with
standard cDDP doses, due to relatively high cytotoxicity of
the two modality approach. Given that the concentrations
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of cDDP in necrotic or poorly vascularized tumor areas
are likely low, reducing the cDDP dose required for
efficient cell killing by co-administering PARP1-i may
allow maintaining local tumor control while limiting
the systemic side effects associated with standard cDDP
concentrations.

RESULTS
Mild hyperthermia induces cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis and inhibits homologous
recombination
To determine the effect of HT on R1, SiHa and
HeLa cells, we first measured changes in cell cycle
distribution and induction of apoptosis. In the cell cycle
analysis (Figure 1A) a G2-arrest was observed 16 h after
treating cells for 1 h with 42°C. This effect was moderate
for R1 cells and more pronounced for SiHa and HeLa
cells. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content showed
a 20% increase in apoptosis for all cell lines (Figure 1B).
Next, We measured the effects of HT on HR activity by
quantifying accumulation of HR factor RAD51 on alphaparticle induced DSBs. Consistently with previously
published results, HT treatment temporarily abrogated
accumulation of RAD51 on DSB sites in all cell lines
(Figure 1C), confirming inactivation of HR.

PARP1-i sensitizes cells moderately to
combinational treatment of cDDP with
hyperthermia
Having confirmed that HR is inhibited by HT in
the used cell lines, we set out to determine the effects
of PARP1 inhibition on the cytotoxicity of cDDP+HT
treatment. To this end, clonogenic survival assays were
conducted as schematically shown. Clonogenic assays
were conducted to investigate the effect of the different
treatments on cell survival Figure 2A. In Figure 2B,
percentages of survival are normalized to the untreated
samples. We observed a ~50% decrease in cell survival
after 1 h cDDP (5 µM) treatment alone. Hyperthermia
as a monotherapy was less effective than treatment with
a PARP1-i. Combining the PARP1-i with cDDP caused
a slight decrease in cell survival, compared to samples
treated with cDDP only. The combination of cDDP and
HT was highly cytotoxic and killed > 85% of cells, while
the combination of hyperthermia and PARP1-i was less
effective. The triple treatment with cDDP, PARP1-i and
HT resulted in a slightly lower cell survival than the
double treatment of cDDP and hyperthermia, but this
difference was not statistically significant.
To further explore the effects of various
treatments, the induction of DSBs was quantified by
counting γ-H2AX foci (Figure 2C). In R1 cells, cDDP
16304

hyperthermia

treatment induced around 20 γ-H2AX foci, while in
SiHa and HeLa a 3–4 fold more γ-H2AX foci were
found 24 h after treatment with cDDP. Treatment
with hyperthermia and cDDP induced a similar
amount of DSBs (70–90) as the triple modality. The
number of detected DSBs was relatively low after the
single treatment with PARP1-i or hyperthermia. The
combination of the PARP1-i with hyperthermia resulted
in a slight increase in the number of DSBs in HeLa
cells, but not in SiHa and R1 cells.
DNA content analysis was performed 48 h after the
various treatments to test whether apoptosis is responsible
for the observed induction of cell death (Figure 2D). All
three cell lines showed > 20% of apoptotic cells after
the single and double modalities, while after the triple
treatment the induction of apoptosis increased significantly
(up to 25–30%).
Cell cycle distribution was not significantly affected
16 h after treatments, except for the combination of
hyperthermia and cDDP and the triple combination, which
caused a ~30–55% increase in accumulation of cells in
S-phase (Figure 2E). These results indicate that addition of
PARP1-i moderately sensitizes cells to the combinational
cDDP+HT treatment, mainly by increasing apoptosis.

To study the cell cycle distribution in more detail,
we followed cells using time-lapse microscopy for 96 h,
starting immediately after the various treatments. In
Figure 3A representative images of the cells are shown
at 0 h (left column) and 96 h (right column) after the
end of the indicated treatments. SiHa and HeLa cells
ceased to grow rapidly after any treatment containing
cDDP. However, thermochemotherapy alone (cDDP+HT)
as well as the triple treatment were the most toxic for
these cells (last two rows of pictures). The combination
treatments had similar effects on the R1 cells, although
they appeared to be less sensitive to cDDP alone. After
96 h, in cDDP+HT or cDDP+HT+PARP1-i treatments,
most of the R1 cells died, while the SiHa and HeLa cells
interrupted their cell cycle progression (Figure 3C). Cells
that did not divide for over 50 h, but did not die, were
regarded to be in ‘cell cycle arrest’. Nevertheless, the cell
cycle time was unaffected in the surviving cells under the
different treatment conditions, both in the first and second
generation post-treatment, except for cells treated with

effectiveness of the commonly used dose of cDDP
concentration (5 μM for 1 h; cDDP/C) to a tenfold lower
cDDP concentration (0.5 μM for 1 h; cDDP/L). We found
similar levels of cell death (Figure 4A) in cells treated
with either cDDP/L+HT+PARP1-i or cDDP/C+HT (R1:
p = 0.10; SiHa: p = 0.86; HeLa: p = 0.22). Time-lapse
microscope analysis confirmed these results at 96 h after
treatment (Figure 4B). Moreover, clonogenic survival
analysis showed that cDDP/L+HT+PARP1-i had similar
cytotoxic effects as the combination of cDDP/C+HT

Adding PARP1-i to cDDP+HT treatment allows
lowering cDDP dose while maintaining similar
levels of cytotoxicity
The effects PARP1-i could be masked by the
relatively high cytotoxicity of the cDDP+HT combination
treatment. To test this hypothesis, we compared the

schemes for different experiments represented in B–E. (B) Clonogenic assays were conducted in order to study the cell survival after 10–12
days post-treatment. No significant differences were found between HT+cDDP and cDDP + HT + PARP1-i. (R1: p = 0.10, SiHa: p = 0.12,
HeLa: p = 0.10). (C) DNA DSBs were analyzed using the γ-H2AX assay. The induction of DSBs in SiHa and HeLa after cDDP treatment is
3-4 times higher than in R1 cells. Nonetheless, all three cells lines show around 70–80 DSBs after cDDP+HT or cDDP+HT+PARP1-i. (D)
The Nicoletti assay was performed to observe apoptosis levels after different treatments. The triple combination treatment gave the highest
levels of apoptosis. (E) Cell cycle was determined via FACS analysis after BrdU incorporation. cDDP+HT and cDDP+HT+PARP1-i show

(Figure 4C). No significant differences were found in
R1, SiHa and HeLa cells (p = 0.10, p = 0.70 and p = 0.20
respectively). These results demonstrate that using a
PARP1-i could allow lowering cDDP dosage without
significantly affecting the treatment efficacy. This might
be of great importance for patients who do not tolerate the
standard concentration of cDDP, due to toxicity.

an experimental setting only gives a minor enhancement
of this effect, a moderate increase in cell death was
observed in all cases. Moreover, at a ten-fold-lower cDDP
concentration plus HT, the loss of tumorcidal effect can
be compensated by PARP1 inhibition. These findings
are consistent both in terms of cell surviving fraction,
γ-H2AX foci staining and apoptosis. The advantage of the
low-dose cDDP+HT+PARP1-i treatment, may be a lower
cDDP related toxicity in patients. Our speculation would
be that inhibition of PARP1-i does not cause an induction
of DNA double strand breaks, but interferes with the
b-NHEJ to prevent repair of double strand breaks [18, 19].
In the Netherlands, combinational treatment
of cDDP and hyperthermia is one of the standard

DISCUSSION
Our results show that the combination of a standard
cDDP-dose plus HT already yields a high tumor kill.
This agrees with clinical studies in women with recurrent
cervical cancer [27]. Although, the addition of PARP1-i in

treatments options for women with recurrent cervical
cancer after previous radiotherapy [14]. Previously
irradiated tumors may have a lower perfusion caused by
the irradiation inducing hypoxia, and hypoxic tumors
are less sensitive to ionizing radiation [28–30]. Clinical
trials have shown that HT is an effective chemosensitizer
for cDDP [31, 32] that increases cDDP uptake in tumor

cells and thus enhances the induction of DNA damage
[33]. Additionally, as described earlier, hyperthermia
also temporality inhibits one of the major DNA repair
pathways, HR, by downregulation of BRCA2 [34, 35],
explaining the rational for thermochemotherapy.
However, one of the limiting effects of cDDP is
nephrotoxicity.

Figure 4: Addition of PARP1-i (100 μM NU1025/continuously) to the commonly used dose of cDDP (5 µM/1 h;
cDDP/C) and HT (42°C/1 h) permits lowering of cDDP concentration (0.5 µM/1 h; cDDP/L). (A) To study apoptosis levels,
the Nicoletti assay was performed 48 h after different treatments. No significant differences were observed between cDDP/L+HT+PARP1-i

Our results may have important clinical implications,
as they suggest the possibility to diminish cDDP related
toxicity, without reducing the desired cytotoxic effect.
Therefore, combining a low dose of cDDP with HT and
a PARP1-i may be a promising approach to increase
tumor control whilst reducing systematic cDDP-toxicity,
particularly in women with (recurrent) cervical cancer. The
triple combination might be interesting for the treatment of
other tumor types as well, because the treatment will also
target tumors with wild-type BRCA status [36, 37] and it
may also be an option for patients in whom radiotherapy
is contra-indicated.
To assess if not only chemotherapy, but also
hyperthermia dose can be reduced, it is also relevant to
further elaborate whether reduction in time at 42°C or the
use of a lower temperature combined with chemotherapy
and a PARP1-i can cause comparable outcome. This is of
clinical interest, since it is not always possible to achieve
42°C for 1 h at the tumor site. If the addition of a PARP1-i
can be used to compensate for hyperthermia treatment at
a shorter time or at a lower temperature, this may improve
treatment outcome.
In several clinical trials the effect of high- and lowdose cDDP has been compared for squamous head and
neck carcinoma [38-40] and cervical carcinoma [41], in
which these studies report acceptable toxicity of low-dose
cDDP in radiochemotherapy without significant differences
in response rate between high- and low-dose cDDP.
Another way to decrease the severe nephrotoxicity
caused by cDDP is to administer high-volume hydration
in cDDP-based chemotherapy. This has been tested in
clinical trials in patients with lung cancer [42, 43] and
resulted in reduction of renal toxicity after high-volume
hydration, while renal function was significantly worse
after low-volume hydration. These effects might be related
to osmolality, and both serum and urinary concentrations
of cDDP [43, 44]. Likewise, as applying low-cDDP dose, a
decrease in nephrotoxicity is achieved when administering
high-volume hydration in patients.
Our results provide rational for adding PARP1-i
to the standard cDDP+HT therapy, because this could
slightly increase overall treatment efficacy, potentially
allow reducing of cDDP concentration. It could also
increase efficacy in tumor area that are poorly accessible
for cDDP and it could increase efficacy in patient that are
subjected to high-volume hydration. In vivo experiments
need to be performed to confirm these findings.

obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). All media contain 25 mM Hepes (Gibco-BRL life
technologies, Breda, The Netherlands) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM
glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37°C in an incubator
with humidified air supplemented with respectively 2%
and 5% CO2. The cell division time during exponential
growth of R1 cells is approximately 16 h and of the
cervical cancer cells 24 h.

Chemical agents
Cells were treated with an optimized concentration
[33, 45, 46] of 5 µM for 1 h cisplatin (cDDP; Platosin®,
Pharmachemie B.V., Haarlem, The Netherlands). For
experiments in which low and commonly used cisplatin
concentrations were compared, cells were treated with
either 0.5 µM (cDDP/L) or the standard dose of 5 µM
(cDDP/C) for 1 h, respectively. The 0.5 µM dose was
determined by performing a titration curve on clonogenic
assays with concentrations between 0 and 5.0 µM cDDP
dose combined with PARP1-i – and found that a 0.5 µM
dose was the lowest dose of cDDP where the combination
had an effect comparable to the effect of the standard
concentration cDDP alone. The medium was refreshed
directly after. To inhibit the b-NHEJ and SSB repair,
100 µM of PARP1-i (NU1025, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol,
UK) was added 30 min prior to hyperthermia. After
refreshing the medium, PARP1-i was re-added till the end
of the experiment in the appropriate concentration.

Hyperthermia
Incubation of the cells was performed by partially
submerging the culture dishes in a thermostatically
controlled water bath (Lauda aqualine AL12, Beun
de Ronde, Abcoude, The Netherlands) for 1 h at 42°C.
Temperature was checked in parallel dishes and the desired
temperature (± 0.1°C) was reached in approximately
5 min. The atmosphere of the water bath was adjustable.
R1 cells were heated in a 2% CO2/98% air atmosphere and
SiHa and HeLa cells were heated in a 5% CO2/95% air
atmosphere with an air inflow of 2 L/min.

Immunohistochemistry
Cells were plated 24 h prior to treatment on sterile
coverslips or 1.8 µm mylar membrane dishes. Cells on
coverslips were treated with cDDP, PARP1-i and/or HT,
while cells on mylar were treated with only hyperthermia
and directly followed by irradiation with α-particles for
1 min. Next, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
after 15 min, 30 min (α-particles) or 24 h. After washing
with PBS and incubated for 30 min with TNBS (PBS
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% FCS), cells were
stained with γ-H2AX (Millipore, dilution 1:100 in TNBS)

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
The rat rhabdomyosarcoma cells (R1) were grown
in MEM and the cervical carcinoma cells (SiHa and HeLa)
were grown in EMEM. The R1 cell line was created in
our own laboratory [44]. SiHa and HeLa cell lines were

and RAD51 antibody (dilution 1:25 in TNBS) as described
by Aten et al. [47]. Finally, vectashield with DAPI (Life
technologies, USA) was dropped at the slide and the
coverslip is turned upside down on the slide, for scoring
under the fluorescence microscope.

Cells were grown in 6-wells plates for 24 h,
before treatments. Dishes were placed under a confocal
microscope (Leica PS2, The Netherlands) with a
temperature and CO2/air controlled chamber and cells
were imaged for 96 h. A minimum of fifty cells were
analyzed per condition.

Clonogenic assays
Cell survival was studied on R1, SiHa and HeLa
cells using different treatment combinations; hyperthermia
(1 h at 42°C), cDDP (cDDP/C: 5 µM for approximately
1 h, cDDP/L: 0.5 µM for approximately 1 h), PARP1-i
(100 µM, continuously). Clonogenic assays were
conducted as described by Franken et al. [48]. Cells were
plated before treatment into 6-well culture plates (Costar,
USA). Dishes were placed in an incubator with 5% CO2
at 37°C until sufficiently large clones were formed.
Afterwards the medium is removed and cells were washed
with PBS. A mixture of 6.0% glutaraldehyde (2–3 ml) and
0.5% crystal violet was added for at least 30 min at room
temperature. Next, plates were washed with water and
dried in normal air at room temperature. Colonies were
counted under a light microscope [49]. Surviving fractions
were calculated by dividing the plating efficiency of
treated cells by that of control cells [50].

Statistics
All represented in vitro data are means ±
standard error of the mean of at least three independent
experiments. Cell survival and apoptosis were analyzed
using SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) statistical software using
a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test.
