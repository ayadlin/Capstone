Abstract
Radiotherapy is a major treatment modality used to treat muscle-invasive bladder cancer, with patient
outcomes similar to surgery. However, radioresistance is a signiﬁcant factor in treatment failure. Cell-free
extracts of muscle-invasive bladder tumors are defective in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), and this
phenotype may be used clinically by combining radiotherapy with a radiosensitizing drug that targets
homologous recombination, thereby sparing normal tissues with intact NHEJ. The response of the homologous recombination protein RAD51 to radiation is inhibited by the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor
imatinib. Stable RT112 bladder cancer Ku knockdown (Ku80KD) cells were generated using short hairpin
RNA technology to mimic the invasive tumor phenotype and also RAD51 knockdown (RAD51KD) cells to
show imatinib's pathway selectivity. Ku80KD, RAD51KD, nonsilencing vector control, and parental RT112
cells were treated with radiation in combination with either imatinib or lapatinib, which inhibits NHEJ and
cell survival assessed by clonogenic assay. Drug doses were chosen at approximately IC40 and IC10 (nontoxic)
levels. Imatinib radiosensitized Ku80KD cells to a greater extent than RAD51KD or RT112 cells. In contrast,
lapatinib radiosensitized RAD51KD and RT112 cells but not Ku80KD cells. Taken together, our ﬁndings
suggest a new application for imatinib in concurrent use with radiotherapy to treat muscle-invasive bladder
cancer. Cancer Res; 73(5); 1611–20. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men
in the United Kingdom (1). In a population-based study,
radiotherapy was found to be as effective as cystectomy in
the treatment of muscle-invasive disease and is being
increasingly required as the population ages (2). Radiotherapy to the bladder results in acute bladder and bowel
toxicities in most patients and, more rarely, causes longterm toxicity in which the most severe cases may require a
cystectomy for alleviation of symptoms. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have been used to improve the

outcome of radiation treatment in muscle-invasive bladder
cancer (3–5). However, elderly patients are not always able
to tolerate conventional chemotherapy agents when used as
radiosensitizers.
For tumors with genomic aberrations/alterations, therapies
targeted toward the expressed proteins, such as the tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) imatinib and lapatinib, are an attractive
option as they do not have the myelosuppressive or neurotoxic
side effects of chemotherapy, although they do cause diarrhea,
skin rash, and very rarely lung ﬁbrosis, and most are available
as oral preparations. However, it is important that such costly
agents are targeted to those patients most likely to beneﬁt.
Imatinib selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL
as well as several receptor tyrosine kinases: the platelet-derived
growth factor receptors (PDGFR-a and -b), the stem cell factor
(SCF) receptor (KIT), the discoidin domain receptors (DDR1
and DDR2), and the colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R; refs. 6, 7) and is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). There are
currently no clinical trials involving imatinib in bladder cancer.
Lapatinib is a TKI that selectively targets the EGF receptor
(EGFR) and HER2 (8) and is indicated in the treatment of
HER2-positive breast cancer. Clinically, lapatinib is primarily
being investigated in metastatic bladder cancer. However,
there is an ongoing pilot study of neoadjuvant lapatinib before
cystectomy (9).
Bladder tumors express tyrosine kinases to varying extents:
50% and 45% overexpress EGFR and HER2, respectively (10),
whereas PDGFR was reportedly expressed in approximately

80% in a Chinese cohort, published only in Chinese. Although
KIT expression has been described in both upper tract tumors
and small cell carcinomas of the bladder (11, 12), neither KIT
nor ABL expression has been studied in transitional cell
carcinomas of the bladder to our knowledge.
Ionizing radiation causes DNA damage, including base
damage, single-strand breaks (SSB), and double-strand breaks
(DSB). Unrepaired or misrepaired DSBs are lethal, resulting in
cell death both in tumors and normal tissues (13, 14). Mammalian cells use 2 major pathways to repair DSBs, namely
homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining
(NHEJ; refs. 15, 16). Homologous recombination is an error-free
pathway, predominantly used in the G2–S phase of the cell
cycle, which requires the sister chromatid to act as a DNA
template. A major homologous recombination protein is
RAD51, which is involved in ATP-dependent DNA strand
exchange. RAD51 expression is increased following ionizing
radiation in tumor cells and induces the formation of RAD51
nuclear foci at sites of DSB (17). NHEJ is the major DSB repair
pathway used in G0 and G1 (18) and involves the DNA-binding
complex Ku70/Ku80 and the DNA-dependent protein kinase
catalytic subunit (DNA PKcs; ref. 19). In addition to the classical
DSB repair pathways, a less efﬁcient Ku-independent pathway
has been described in Ku-deﬁcient yeast cells, which involves
microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ; ref. 20).
We have previously shown the MMEJ phenotype in vitro
using cell-free extracts from muscle-invasive bladder tumors,
and this is associated with reduced Ku–DNA binding and loss
of TP53 function (21). Pucci and colleagues also showed
reduced Ku–DNA binding in 5 advanced breast and muscleinvasive bladder tumors (22). This error-prone repair was not
detected in normal human urothelial cell extracts (23), which
suggests a therapeutic window that could be targeted by novel
therapies. Negroni and colleagues (24) inhibited Ku80 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) using short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) in RT112 bladder cancer cells and showed increased
radiosensitivity and reduced Ku–DNA binding compared with
parental RT112 vector-transfected cells.
The outcome of clinical radiotherapy depends, in part, upon
the extent of DNA damage and how efﬁciently the cells can
repair this damage. Selective targeting of DNA repair pathways
could increase tumor cell kill while sparing normal tissues, thus
increasing the therapeutic ratio. ABL upregulates RAD51 gene
expression and imatinib reduces RAD51 protein expression
and RAD51-chromatin binding (25) and reduces error-free
homologous recombination efﬁciency (17). Imatinib also
reduces the increased RAD51 expression induced by ionizing
radiation and reduces the associated RAD51 nuclear focus
formation in glioma cell lines (25), and in bladder, pancreatic,
prostate, and lung carcinoma cell lines, imatinib increases cell
kill in combination with ionizing radiation, due in part to
mitotic catastrophe (17), unlike normal ﬁbroblasts, where cell
survival is unaffected. In xenograft studies, imatinib increases
growth delay following fractionated radiotherapy in glioblastoma, epidermoid, and prostate carcinoma models with no
apparent increase in toxicity (17, 26).
EGFR inhibitors, such as lapatinib, can act as radiosensitizers by targeting the intracellular signaling cascades (including

1612

Cancer Res; 73(5) March 1, 2013

Ras-MAPK and PI3K-AKT), which are triggered by binding of
ligand to the transmembrane EGFR ligand-binding domain
(27, 28). These cascades are normally activated by ionizing
radiation in EGFR-overexpressing tumors, resulting in radioresistance (27). Moreover, they also act as radiosensitizers by
repressing DNA repair in irradiated cells although this occurs
via the NHEJ pathway, through inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–mediated stimulation of DNA PKcs and
by blocking of the nuclear interaction between EGFR and DNA
PKcs normally induced by ionizing radiation [reviewed by
Baumann and colleagues (27)].
We hypothesized that in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it
would be better to use an agent that targets the homologous
recombination pathway rather than the NHEJ pathway. This
would result in a form of "synthetic sickness" (see ref. 29 for
recent review), where tumor cells already deﬁcient in NHEJ
would have reduced homologous recombination efﬁciency and
repair, and thus increased ionizing radiation–induced lethality. As imatinib is known to target homologous recombination
via RAD51 (17, 25), it may be one such agent, and the combination of imatinib and radiotherapy should result in an
increased therapeutic ratio for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
We therefore sought to see whether ABL, KIT, PDGFR, HER2,
or EGFR are targets in bladder cancer by determining their role
in radiotherapy response. We then moved to an experimental
system to test the effectiveness of therapies that might be used
in combination with radiotherapy to enhance radiosensitivity.
This included targeting the ABL/RAD51 and EGFR pathways.

Materials and Methods
Tissue samples and imunohistochemistry
Ninety-one formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded bladder
tumor biopsy samples were obtained from patients treated
with radical radiotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder at the Leeds Cancer Centre (West Yorkshire, United
Kingdom) from 2002 to 2005. Details of the patients and
radiotherapy treatments have been described previously
(30). Patients gave informed consent for use of their tissues
and local ethical approval was obtained from the Leeds (East)
Research Ethics Committee (project 04/Q1206/62).
Antibody conditions were optimized by staining sections
from control tissues, namely breast tumor for ABL, HER2,
EGFR, and PDGFR and skin tumor for KIT. Then 4-mm sections
from the bladder tumor specimens were heated, dewaxed, and
hydrated in xylene, graded alcohols, and water. Antigen retrieval was achieved by boiling in EDTA (1 mmol/L at pH 8.0) or
citric acid (pH 6.0) for 2 minutes of pressure cooking before
quenching endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 for
30 minutes. Endogenous protein-binding activity was
blocked using avidin–biotin–blocking agent (Vector) and
normal goat serum (Dako) before incubation with primary
antibody: anti-ABL (1:250; NeoMarkers), anti-c-HER2 (1:200,
Dako), anti-EGFR (1:100; Novocastra), anti-KIT (1:40; Novocastra), and anti-PDGFRb (1:25; Cell Signalling) diluted in
diluent (Dako) for 1 hour. Samples were then incubated for
30 minutes with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using the Dako ChemMate Detection Kit
(Dako). Immunoreactivity was revealed by incubation of

sections with 3-30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) for 10 minutes
before washing, taking through graded alcohols, clearing in
xylene and counterstaining with hematoxylin (VWR) before
mounting in dibutylphthalate xylene (Leica). Digital images
were captured within invasive tumor areas (3–10 images per
slide, 400 magniﬁcation) using an Olympus BX50 microscope and c-3030 camera.
Assessment was made of the percentage and intensity of
tumor cells with membranous staining based on the recommendations for interpretation of the HercepTest: gastric
cancer (31). Brieﬂy, for all antibodies studied, complete, basolateral, or lateral membrane staining was scored as an intensity
of 3þ for strong intensity and 2þ for weak to moderate
intensity, where at least 10% of the tumors cells stained
positive. Partial membrane staining or only faint/barely perceptible intensity staining in at least 10% of tumor cells was
scored as a 1þ. Staining intensity was scored independently in
a blinded manner by 2 observers, discordant scores were
reviewed, and a consensus was reached.
Cause-speciﬁc survival was deﬁned from day 1 of radiotherapy until death from bladder cancer. Death from another cause
was considered a censored observation. Kaplan–Meier curves
were plotted for cause-speciﬁc survival and the log-rank
statistic used to compare survival times across categories of
protein expression.

the ﬁgure legends), and the cells then trypsinized and resuspended in medium containing drug as required.
Clonogenic assays
Following the necessary treatments, cells were plated at
appropriate cell numbers in triplicate in 10-cm culture dishes
containing 10 mL of fresh medium, with or without drug as
required (see relevant ﬁgure legends). After 14 days incubation,
the cells were stained with 1% methylene blue (Sigma) in 50%
ethanol, and colonies with more than 50 cells were counted.
The surviving fraction was determined as the total number of
colonies formed divided by the total number of cells plated
multiplied by the plating efﬁciency, as determined in untreated
cells. Radiation survival curves were plotted after normalization for the cytotoxicity induced by control or drug alone, in
GraphPad Prism, using the linear-quadratic model with the
equation SF ¼ exp (aD þ GbD2). Each point on the survival
curve represents the mean surviving fraction from at least
3 independent experiments.

Cell irradiation
Cells were harvested from exponential-phase cultures and
diluted to 1,000 cells/mL. Five milliliter cell suspensions were
then irradiated in tubes at a dose-rate of 1.0 Gy/min using an Xray machine (Irradiator 320, NDT Equipment Services Ltd.), or
cesium-137 source at 1.12 Gy/min using a Gamma-Service
Medical GmbH GSR D1 irradiator. The cells were then replated
into 10-cm dishes at appropriate cell densities.

RNA interference using short hairpin RNA
The siRNA expression vector pSilencer 2.1-U6 neomycin
(Ambion), which contains a human U6 RNA polymerase III
promoter able to transcribe shRNAs, was used in these experiments. Two constructs were made for each of Ku80 and RAD51
(see Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1),
whereby complementary oligonucleotides were used to encode
hairpin siRNA inserts, designed to target a 21-mer sequence of
human Ku80 coding region or 30 -untranslated region (UTR)
mRNA, or RAD51 coding region mRNA, respectively. These were
designed using the Ambion Insert Design Tool for pSilencer
vectors and purchased from Sigma, and were then annealed and
ligated into the linearized pSilencer vector. Circular negative
control pSilencer neovector, that expresses a hairpin siRNA with
limited homology to any known sequence in the human genome,
was used in experiments as a nonspeciﬁc negative control.
The target sequences in the human Ku80 or RAD51 gene
were determined empirically and analyzed by BLAST search, to
conﬁrm a lack of homology to other coding sequences, as per
manufacturer's recommendations. The target sequences of
clones used for clonogenic assays were Ku80 50 -AAC TCC ATT
CCT GGT ATA GAA-30 (Ku80 coding region target sequence 1)
and for RAD51 50 -AAT CAC TAA TCA GGT GGT AGC-30

pSilencer-RAD51, or circular negative control pSilencer neovector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. After 24 hours, fresh medium was
added containing the selection reagent G418 (600 mg/mL;
Gibco, Invitrogen). Selection was continued for 14 days, with
the medium refreshed every other day. Single clones were
picked and tested for Ku80 and RAD51 expression, respectively,
by Western blotting and subsequently tested for ionizing
radiation sensitivity using clonogenic assays.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer (Sigma) with 1% of protease inhibitor and
phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma). The cells were allowed to swell
on ice for 20 minutes; then the lysate was centrifuged for 30
seconds at 12,000  g. The supernatant was carefully removed
and stored at 20 C. Total protein concentration in cell lysates
was determined by the method of Bradford (Sigma). Thirty to
50 mg of protein was resolved on 4% to 20% polyacrylamide gels
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The resulting
membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (Li-cor) and
primary antibodies. The antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal ABL (2862; Cell Signalling), rabbit polyclonal Rad51
(ab63801; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal EGFR (sc-03; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-Ku80 (Ab-2; Neomarkers), mouse monoclonal b-tubulin (clone TUB2.1 TT4026;
Sigma), and mouse monoclonal b-actin (ab8226; Abcam).
Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Li-cor)
were used and detected by infra red scanning densitometry

using the Li-cor Odyssey Infrared Detection System (Li-cor
Biosciences UK Ltd.). Quantiﬁcation was based on normalization to b-actin. The immunoblotting experiments were
carried out at least 3 times.
Cell-cycle analysis
Propidium iodide (PI) staining and ﬂow cytometry were
used to determine cell-cycle stages. Cells from the batches used
for clonogenic assays were washed with PBS, ﬁxed in ice-cold
70% ethanol, and stored at 4 C before analysis. Cells were spun
down and resuspended in PI solution (50 mg/mL PI, 0.5 mg/mL
RNase; Applied Biosystem) and incubated at room temperature in the dark at least for 30 minutes. DNA content was
detected by ﬂow cytometry (Beckman FACScan system). The
relative proportions of cells in the G1, S, and G2–M phases of the
cell cycle were determined using ModFit LT 3.2 software.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS16.0 software. Clonogenic assays were conducted in triplicate at least 3
times, with the results expressed as mean þ SD as appropriate.
Western blot analyses were conducted at least 3 times independently. Results were considered statistically signiﬁcant at a
P < 0.05, using a two-tailed unpaired Student t test. Sensitizer
enhancement ratios (SER) were calculated at a surviving
fraction of 0.1 (10% survival). Cause-speciﬁc survival was
deﬁned from day 1 of radiotherapy until death of the patient
from bladder cancer. Death from another cause was considered a censored observation. Kaplan–Meier curves were

Results
Expression of tyrosine kinases in bladder tumor samples
We sought to estimate the percentage of muscle-invasive
bladder tumors expressing the tyrosine kinases of interest
(imatinib: ABL, KIT, and PDGFR-b; lapatinib: HER2 and EGFR),
on the basis that this is likely to represent the cohort of patients
for which the addition of a TKI to their radiotherapy may be
beneﬁcial. We also wished to determine whether these factors
were prognostic in these patients, who had not received such
treatments in addition to radiotherapy. The Dako scoring
system for the HercepTest was applied to our tyrosine kinases
of interest in 91 formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded bladder
tumor samples (Fig. 1A). A sample was classiﬁed as positive
if there was membranous staining in at least 10% of cells, which
met the threshold criteria for intensity of staining (2þ or 3þ).
In 75 of 91 (82%) cases there was positive immunostaining for
ABL. In contrast, KIT expression was undetectable in most of
the cases but showed weak staining in 8 cases, and PDGFR-b
was expressed in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells but
was undetectable in bladder tumor cell membranes. There
were 87 of 91 cases (96%) positive for EGFR staining and 86 of
90 (96%) cases HER2-positive.
We also correlated tyrosine kinase expression with patient
survival, to look for prognostic signiﬁcance of high expression.
We classiﬁed patients into those with low tumor tyrosine
kinase expression (equal or less than 2þ) and patients with
high (3þ) expression levels (as there were insufﬁcient tumors
scoring 0/1þ for meaningful comparison with 2þ/3þ). Neither
ABL, EGFR, nor HER2 were signiﬁcantly correlated with
patient survival (Fig. 1B).
Effects of imatinib and lapatinib on RT112 cell
proliferation
Before combining drug and radiation treatments, it was ﬁrst
necessary to determine the growth-inhibitory activity of the
drugs in RT112 cells. Figure 2 shows cell viabilities by clonogenic assay following 14 days treatment with varying concentrations of imatinib or lapatinib. The IC50 value for imatinib in
RT112 cells was 8 mmol/L and for lapatinib 3.5 mmol/L.

Inhibition of Ku80 or RAD51 expression in RT112 cells by
siRNA
To generate NHEJ-deﬁcient and homologous recombination–deﬁcient RT112 cells, we used a siRNA-based strategy to
reduce Ku80 or RAD51 expression in RT112 cells. We tested the
effectiveness of 2 21-mer siRNAs targeting different sites within
the exons or 30 -UTR regions of Ku80 and RAD51 (Supplementary Table S1), using pSilencer2.1-U6 neomycin, which drives
expression of a shRNA from the human U6 promoter. The
hairpin RNA is then processed into an siRNA, which induces
RNAi of the target gene. RT112 cells were stably transfected
with each of the vectors and clones picked and tested using
Western blotting and ionizing radiation clonogenic assays. An
individual clone for each of Ku80 (C13, coding region) and
RAD51 (795J) was then selected for drug-ionizing radiation
clonogenic assays. Densitometric analysis of representative

drug, before irradiation and plating followed by 14 days incubation, before staining and counting. Drug doses were chosen
at approximately IC40 (high) and at IC10 nontoxic (low) levels.
Radiation survival curves were generated for each cell line
after normalization for the level of cell killing induced by drug
alone. As shown in Fig. 4A–C, 3 mmol/L imatinib had a
signiﬁcant radiosensitizing effect on Ku80KD cells (SER 1.27;
P ¼ 0.03) but no signiﬁcant effect in parental RT112 cells (SER
¼ 1.07; P ¼ 0.051) or RAD51KD cells. At 6 mmol/L concentration, equivalent to approximately IC40, imatinib produced an
SER of 1.69 in Ku80KD cells (P ¼ 0.03) but only an SER of 1.34 in
the RT112 parental cell line (P ¼ 0.03; P ¼ 0.046 compared with
Ku80KD 6 mmol/L imatinib survival curve) and 1.11 in the
RAD51KD cells (P ¼ 0.03; P ¼ 0.04 compared with Ku80KD 6
mmol/L imatinib survival curve).
In contrast, lapatinib radiosensitized RT112 cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4D; SER ¼ 1.13 and 1.30 for 0.6 mmol/L;
P ¼ 0.02 and 2.4 mmol/L; P ¼ 0.01) but had no radiosensitizing
effect on Ku80KD cells at either low (0.6 mmol/L) or high (2.4
mmol/L) concentrations (Fig. 4E). However, in contrast to
imatinib, lapatinib had a dramatic radiosensitizing effect in
RAD51KD cells, even at low dose (SER ¼ 1.27; P ¼ 0.02), with
the high dose resulting in inhibition of RAD51KD cell colony
formation, even without ionizing radiation (Fig. 4F).

Western blot analyses revealed a 30% reduction in Ku80
protein expression in C13 cells and 75% reduction in RAD51
expression in 795J cells compared with parental RT112 cells

Ku80 or RAD51 interference causes a decreased viability
of RT112 after X-ray exposure
We examined the radiosensitizing effect of siRNA-mediated
downregulation of Ku80 and RAD51 expression in RT112 cells
using clonogenic assays. We found a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in radiosensitivity for the Ku80KD (P ¼ 0.01) and
RAD51KD (P ¼ 0.02) cells as compared with parental RT112
and RT112-pSilencer vector control cells (Fig. 3).

We then tested our hypothesis that imatinib radiosensitizes
NHEJ-deﬁcient Ku80KD cells, whereas having less effect on the
parental RT112 cells with an intact NHEJ pathway, due to
targeting the ionizing radiation-induced increase in RAD51.
We conducted clonogenic assays on RT112, Ku80KD, and
RAD51KD cells using relevant drug–ionizing radiation combinations. Cells were incubated for 24 hours with or without

Imatinib as Radiosensitizer in Bladder Cancer

Cell-cycle effects of imatinib and lapatinib
To determine whether the drug-mediated enhancement of
radiosensitivity was due to cellular synchronization into a
radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle, PI staining and ﬂow
cytometry were used to determine the cell-cycle phase distribution of samples used in each independent clonogenic assay.
Neither imatinib nor lapatinib caused obvious cell-cycle arrest
in treated cells of each cell type, except for a small increase in
G1 fraction in RAD51KD cells treated by lapatinib at both drug
concentrations (Fig. 5; P ¼ 0.02 low dose; P ¼ 0.04 high dose).
Effects of imatinib and lapatinib on RAD51 and EGFR
We also measured expression of ABL, EGFR, HER2, and
RAD51 using Western blotting (Fig. 6). Cells were incubated
with or without drug for 24 hours and then irradiated to 8 Gy or
left untreated. Forty-eight hours later, cells were lysed for
Western blotting. RT112, Ku80KD (C13) and RAD51KD
(759J) cells all had detectable baseline levels of ABL, EGFR,
and RAD51 although RAD51 levels were markedly reduced in

the RAD51KD cells. HER2 was not detectable in any of the cell
lines. We found no major increase in RAD51 levels following 8
Gy ionizing radiation. Imatinib treatment was associated with
reduced RAD51 levels in RT112 and Ku80KD cells both alone
and following 8 Gy ionizing radiation but no effect on ABL
levels; lapatinib had no effect on RAD51 levels.

Discussion
Radiotherapy is a valid option in the radical treatment of
muscle-invasive bladder cancer, with similar survival rates to
cystectomy in our recent study (2). Cytotoxic chemotherapy is
often combined with radiotherapy to improve survival rates
(3–5), but this can be at the expense of late side effects.
Moreover, many patients with bladder cancer who elect to
have radiotherapy are elderly with poor renal function, and
therefore cannot tolerate cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. There is therefore an urgent need to identify less toxic
agents suitable for these patients.

Our immunohistochemistry data show that ABL is
expressed in more than 80% of muscle-invasive bladder
tumors, suggesting that imatinib might be useful in such
patients. EGFR and HER2 staining was positive in more than
95% of bladder tumors. While the Kaplan–Meier survival
curves (Fig. 1B) showed no prognostic signiﬁcance, our sample
numbers were relatively small, with only 73% power to detect a
HR of 0.4, with 35 cause-speciﬁc survival events at P ¼ 0.05.
Also, we used a scoring system developed for another tumor
type and have not validated our ﬁndings in an independent
patient cohort, so results should be treated with caution. As we
did not have access to a patient cohort treated with a TKI and
radiotherapy, we cannot comment on the potential predictive
value of such markers.
We established that both imatinib and lapatinib are cytotoxic in the RT112 bladder cancer cell-line, which has modest
ABL and EGFR expression levels (Fig. 2). Choudhury and
colleagues (17) found an IC50 value of 20 mmol/L for imatinib
in RT112 cells, whereas ours was 8 mmol/L; McHugh and
colleagues found the IC50 for lapatinib in RT112 cells was
1.1 mmol/L MTT assay (32), ours being 3.5 mmol/L on clonogenic assay, perhaps reﬂecting differences in experimental
systems. We then successfully knocked-down both Ku80 and
RAD51, using shRNA technology, in TP53 wild-type RT112 cell
lines (Fig. 3). Negroni and colleagues (24) used the same
method to knockdown Ku80 in RT112 cells and showed
radiosensitivity and reduced Ku–DNA binding. We previously
observed the latter in muscle-invasive bladder tumor extracts.
We then showed the radiosensitizing effects of both imatinib
and lapatinib in RT112, Ku80KD, and RAD51KD cells (Fig. 4).
Imatinib was an effective radiosensitizer in Ku80KD cells but
less effective in parental RT112 cells. Although it did not affect

1618

Cancer Res; 73(5) March 1, 2013

ABL expression levels (Fig. 6) in both parental RT112 cells and
Ku80KD cells, imatinib treatment was associated with reduced
RAD51 expression levels both with and without ionizing radiation. As imatinib had no radiosensitizing effect at low dose
and only limited effects at high dose in RAD51KD cells, this
seems to support our hypothesis that imatinib works through
the homologous recombination pathway but not the NHEJ
pathway. In contrast, lapatinib had no radiosensitizing effect
on Ku80KD cells but a marked effect in RAD51KD cells and also
sensitized parental RT112 cells, consistent with lapatinib
acting via NHEJ rather than homologous recombination.
Recently, Myllynen and colleagues (33) showed that both
homologous recombination and NHEJ are involved in regulation of DSB repair by EGFR, using an I-SceI–based reporter
system, with reduction of homologous recombination by the
TKI erlotinib at 0.5 mmol/L and less so by the monoclonal
antibody cetuximab at 30 nmol/L concentration. However, our
experiments suggest that lapatinib does not act on homologous recombination at 0.6 or 2.4 mmol/L. Other than a small
effect on G1 arrest for lapatinib at both concentrations in
RAD51KD cells, neither drug affected cell-cycle progression at
24 hours. Lapatinib has been found to induce G1 arrest in
bladder cancer (RT112, 45%–65% G1 cells after 72 hours of 1.1
mmol/L lapatinib; ref. 34) and gastric cancer cell lines (58% G1
to 70% after 24 hours of 1 mmol/L lapatinib; ref. 35). Treatment
with imatinib (5–6 mmol/L) for 48 to 72 hours caused a slight
increase in the number of cells in G1-phase in head-and-neck
squamous carcinoma cell lines (47% G1 to 58%; ref. 36), ovarian
cancer cell lines (80% G1 to 94%; ref. 37) but not in small-cell
lung carcinoma cell lines (38).
Our data support the role of DNA repair in both imatinib and
lapatinib's radiosensitizing effects. They suggest that imatinib

Imatinib as Radiosensitizer in Bladder Cancer

may be a useful radiosensitizer in muscle-invasive bladder
cancer, as our tumors so far have all shown the MMEJ phenotype, with defective Ku–DNA binding and defective TP53
function, whereas superﬁcial tumors had intact NHEJ (21). We
are currently testing further tumor sample extracts. If some
muscle-invasive tumors show intact NHEJ, imatinib would not
be appropriate as a radiosensitizer in these patients, and there
would be a need to develop a preradiotherapy predictive endjoining assay for use in patients with muscle-invasive bladder
cancer. An advantage of imatinib as a radiosensitizer in this
context, unlike lapatinib, is that we would expect normal tissue
sparing and an increase in therapeutic ratio.
