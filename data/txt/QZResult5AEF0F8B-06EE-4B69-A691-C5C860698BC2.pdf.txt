Abstract:

The Pim kinases are weak oncogenes. However, when co-expressed with a strong
oncogene, such as c-Myc, Pim kinases potentiate the oncogenic effect resulting in
an acceleration of tumorigenesis. In this study we show that the least studied Pim
kinase, Pim-3, is encoded by a gene directly regulated by c-Myc via binding to one
of the conserved E-boxes within the Pim3 gene. Accordingly, lymphomas arising
in Myc-transgenic mice and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines exhibit elevated levels of
Pim-3. Interestingly, inhibition of Pim kinases by a novel pan-Pim kinase inhibitor,
Pimi, in Myc-induced lymphoma results in cell death that appears independent of
caspases. The data indicate that Pim kinase inhibition could be a viable treatment
strategy in certain human lymphomas that rely on Pim-3 kinase expression.

Introduction

transgenes [6-8]. However, when co-expressed with Myc
they strongly accelerate Myc-driven lymphomagenesis
[6, 9-11]. The Pim kinase genes are located on different
chromosomes but they encode proteins with similar sizes
and with a high degree of homology [12].
The Pim kinases phosphorylate a wide variety
of cellular targets involved in regulating the cell cycle,
including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and
p27 [13-15], cell cycle proteins such as CDC25A and
CDC25C [16, 17]and suppressors of cytokine signaling
SOCS1 and SOCS3 [18, 19]. Moreover Pim kinases also
phosphorylate proteins involved in translation such as
eIF4B [20] and 4EBP1 [21], pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
member Bad [21-24] and transcriptional regulators such
as Myc [25], Myb [26], RUNX1 and RUNX3 [27].
Recently it was shown that Pim-1 can bind the Myc-Max
complex and so get recruited to E-boxes from where
Pim-1 can phosphorylate serine 10 on histone H3 [28].
This phosphorylation regulates up to 20% of the Myc
transcriptional targets, some of which are needed for Myc
driven transformation. It is not known whether all of the
above-described functions represent separable functions

Tumorigenesis is a multistep process where several
acquired genetic alterations, or hallmarks, occur leading to
transformation of a cell [1]. c-Myc is a transcription factor
with more than 1000 target genes (www.myccancergene.
org), many of which directly impinge on the hallmarks
of cancer. Therefore, Myc expression is often selected
for during various steps in the genesis of many types of
human cancer. To avoid transformation, normal cells can
respond to Myc overexpression by undergoing apoptosis
or senescence [2, 3]. Thus, for Myc overexpression
to drive transformation additional genetic alterations
affecting apoptotic signaling are required [4], thereby
allowing the state of genomic instability that facilitates
the required accumulation of mutations.
The Pim kinase family is a group of three serine/
threonine kinases encoded by genes that were identified
as hotspots for proviral integration of Moloney murine
leukemia virus (Pim) in retrovirus-induced lymphomas
[5]. The three kinases, Pim-1, Pim-2 and Pim-3, are
considered weakly oncogenic when expressed as

Figure 2: The Pim3 gene has evolutionary conserved E-boxes, which mediate Myc-regulated transcription. (A)

Schematic representation of mouse and human Pim3 loci, which contain two evolutionarily conserved E-boxes (CACGTG). (B) NIH
3T3 fibroblasts carrying a MycER construct were treated with the estrogen receptor (ER) agonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) with or
without the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) for 4 h and were then harvested for qRT-PCR analysis of Pim expression. Srm,
a Myc target gene with five E-boxes, was used as a positive control. (C) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was run on λ820
cells using a Myc antibody to immunoprecipitate the E-box regions. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was subsequently analyzed by qPCR
utilizing primers directed against E-box regions of the Myc target genes Srm and Odc but also against the E-box1 in the Pim3 locus. As
a negative control primers designed not to recognize the Pim3 gene (Pim3-ctrl) were used. Percent total chromatin immunoprecipitated
was calculated using the equation % total = 2 (Ct input - Ct ChIP) x % input and was presented as “Relative fold increase” calculated accordingly,
% total sample / % total negative control. The negative control value was generated by immunoprecipitation using normal rabbit IgG.
Shown is one of two independent experiments yielding similar results. (D) The human BL cell line P493-6 carrying a tetracycline (tetoff) regulatable system for Myc expression was cultured with 0.1μg/ml tetracycline (tet) or without tet for 8 hours, after which cells were
harvested for qRT-PCR analysis of Pim and Myc transcripts (E) P493-6 cells from the same experiment were also harvested for western blot
analysis of Pim-3 and Myc protein expression. (F) P493-6 cells were cultured with tetracycline for 72 hours and then divided into two subcultures, one with tetracycline (myc off) and one without (myc on), and were cultured for another 8 hours before being harvested for ChIP
analysis. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using a Myc antibody and the qPCR was run with primers directed against the PIM3 E-box1,
primers not recognizing the PIM3 gene as negative controls, and primers against CCND2 as a positive control. Percent total chromatin
immunoprecipitated was calculated as described above. Data were presented as “Fold increase (%total – tet / %total+tet)”. Shown is one of

l enhancer. To our surprise we find that the most highly
expressed Pim kinase in these lymphomas is Pim3, and that Pim3 is a Myc target gene. These data may
partly explain why proviral activation of Pim1 and
Pim2 in Eµ-Myc mice occurs most frequently – Pim3
is already activated by Myc. Importantly, we also show
that inhibition of Pim kinases induces cell death of Mycinduced lymphomas.

overexpressed.

Pim3 is a direct Myc transcriptional target
Myc transcription is mediated through E box
sequences, most often CACGTG [30-37]. To investigate
if the high levels of Pim-3 in Myc-expressing cells and
tumors were due to a direct induction of transcription, we
first analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the Pim3 locus
and found that it contains two potential E-boxes, which
were conserved in mice and man (Figure 2A). We then
infected NIH3T3 fibroblasts with a retrovirus expressing
Myc-ER, an inducible form of Myc that can be activated
by adding the estrogen analog 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)
to the culture medium. Addition of 4-HT, with or without
the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, showed that the
mRNA of the direct Myc target Srm could be induced
2-fold even when translation was inhibited, as could Pim3
mRNA (Figure 2B). Because Pim3 also was induced by
cycloheximide, which complicates interpretation of these
types of experiments, we analyzed whether Myc binds
the E-boxes of the Pim3 locus by performing chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) on formaldehyde
cross-linked DNA from a λ-Myc transgenic mouse B-cell
lymphoma cell line, λ820, established in our laboratory
[38]. Indeed, when ChIP was performed using primers
designed to flank E-box 1 of Pim3, the signal obtained
was comparable to that of the signal obtained with primers
against Srm and Odc (Figure 2C), two confirmed Myc
transcriptional targets [39, 40]. Primers against a sequence
one kb downstream of the Pim3 gene was used as negative
control, and yielded signals 3-7 times weaker. To assess if
Myc directly regulates PIM3 in human cells we used the
P493-6 lymphoma cell line, which has a tetracycline (Tet)
regulatable Myc cassette, which is silent in the presence of
tetracycline [41]. P493-6 cells were incubated 72 hours in
the presence of tetracycline (Myc off) after which they were
split in two cell culture flasks, one culture with tetracycline
(Myc off) and one culture without tetracycline (Myc on).
The two cultures were then incubated for 8 hours, after
which cells were harvested for mRNA, protein and ChIP
analysis. We ran a qRT-PCR on mRNA harvested from
these samples to measure the PIM levels with and without
Myc expression. In accordance with the mouse results
expression of Pim-3 kinase, but not Pim-1 or Pim-2, was
induced by Myc activation at the transcriptional (Figure
2D) and translational level (Figure 2E). Moreover, ChIP
experiments performed using a Myc antibody showed that
the PIM3 E-box 1 was immunoprecipitated from the same
P493-6 cell preparation, although to a lesser extent than
the Myc target gene Cyclin D2 (CCND2) [42-44] (Figure
2F). Taken together, our results confirm that E-box 1 in
the PIM3 locus is a functional target of Myc-mediated
transcription in both human and mouse lymphoma cells.

Results
Pim-3 kinase protein levels are elevated in Myc
over expressing tumors
Although considered weak oncogenes, all Pim
kinase family members have been shown to strongly
potentiate Myc driven tumorigenesis as proviral insertion
targets or transgenes [6, 9-11]. Although these landmark
studies established a genetic link between Myc and Pim
kinases, they did not address whether this synergy could
be established spontaneously in a reciprocal manner.
To partly address this we analyzed B-cell tumors from
λ-Myc transgenic mice for Pim kinase mRNA expression
levels. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)
showed that elevated RNA levels of Pim1 and Pim2 could
be observed in some tumors but that Pim3 was the only
Pim kinase family member with significantly elevated
mRNA levels in all tumors as compared to wildtype B
cells (Figure 1A). Interestingly, elevated Pim3 mRNA and
Pim-3 protein were seen not only in tumors but also in B
cells harvested from 4-6 week old precancerous mice with
no signs of lymphoma (Figure 1A and 1 B). Moreover,
tumor cell lines established from λ-Myc and Eµ-Myc
transgenic mouse B cell tumors still exhibited elevated
mRNA levels of Pim3, suggesting the importance of
maintaining expression even in conditions of surplus
growth factors (Figure 1C). To analyze which of the
Pim kinases were expressed in human lymphomas, we
analyzed a set of human Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines
by qRT-PCR. When Pim kinase expression in the human
BL cell line DG75 was set to 1, it appeared as if Pim1
and Pim2 mRNA is elevated in all the BL cells (Figure
1D). However, when analyzing the Ct values it became
obvious that Pim3 was the more abundant Pim transcript
because a signal was obtained at cycle 21, as opposed to
cycle 23 or higher for Pim1 and Pim2 mRNAs. Moreover,
immunohistochemistry analysis of Pim-3 expression
in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma
(FL), diffuse large cell B-­cell lymphoma (DLCBL) and
BL showed that BL is the lymphoma-type that exhibits
the highest Pim-3 expression (Figure 1E). Taken together,
the data indicate that Pim-3 is the main Pim kinase
overexpressed in Myc-induced lymphomas from mice and
patients whereas Pim-1 and Pim-2 are more sporadically

phosphorylation of Serine10 on histone H3 (H3S10) [28].
The phosphorylation is mediated by Pim-1 interacting
with Myc in the transcriptional active Myc-Max dimer,
thus recruiting Pim-1 to E-boxes of active transcription.
Since inhibition of Myc signaling in Myc-driven tumors
can lead to growth arrest, senescence and cell death we
entertained the idea that the observed effect of Pimi could
be mediated by inhibition of Myc function. We therefore
treated the mouse B cell lymphoma cell line Eµ239 with
10 μM Pimi for 24 hours, harvested mRNA and analyzed
it using qRT-PCR for the Myc regulated genes Amd1 [39]
, Aurkb [64], Cad [65], Shmt1, Shmt2 [66] and Srm [39].
Interestingly, several of the Myc-regulated target genes
were down-regulated in Pimi-treated cells compared
to DMSO controls (Figure 3E). On the other hand,
expression of the disputed Myc target gene Id2 [67, 68],
was induced by Pimi.

The Pim kinase inhibitor Pimi hampers cellular
proliferation and causes a reduction in Myc
regulated transcripts
Pim kinase expression has been associated with
poor outcome in several different tumor types [4558] and chemoresistance have been seen in tumor cells
overexpressing the Pim kinases [59-62]. This has inspired
efforts to inhibit the Pim kinases as a cancer treatment.
Since the triple knockout Pim kinase mice are viable and
fertile, this suggests that inhibition of the Pim kinase
family could be possible without severe side effects
[12]. To test this notion we obtained a specific pan-Pim
kinase inhibitor (Compound 14j [63] [A953864.1] or from
now on Pimi) generated by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott
Park, IL). This inhibitor exhibits low nanomolar activity
against Pim-3, Pim-1 and Pim-2 (0.5 nM, 2 nM, 3 nM,
respectively) and shows high degree of selectivity for
Pim kinases (personal communication, Dr. Joel Leverson,
Abbott Laboratories). To investigate if this inhibitor
hits the expected targets, Pim kinases, and exhibits antiproliferative activity in Myc-induced lymphomas, we
treated the mouse B-cell lymphoma cell lines Eµ239 and
λ820 with Pimi and Pim-ci, a 1000-fold less potent Pim
inhibitor from the same chemical series. As seen in Figure
3A, Western Blot analysis revealed that phosphorylation
of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member
Bad on Ser112, which is believed to be a specific Pim
kinase site, started to become decreased at 10 nM and
was abolished in cells treated for 8 h with 10 µM Pimi,
whereas Pim-ci did not affect phosphorylation. Moreover,
measurement of incorporation of 3H-thymidine following
48 h of treatment with 10 nM to 10 µM Pimi demonstrated
an EC50 of 2.6 µM or 6 µM for Eµ239 and λ820 cells,
respectively (not shown). Since Pim-ci and the vehicle,
DMSO, did not exert any anti-proliferative effects when
added in the same relative quantities, we did not calculate
EC50s for them.
To gain insight into the anti-proliferative effect of
Pimi we generated growth curves on B cell lymphoma
lines from mice and BL patients. Much like what was
suggested from the 3H-thymidine incorporation assay,
Eµ239 cells were sensitive to 10 µM Pimi, manifest as
both slower growth and induction of cell death (Figure
3B). Surprisingly however, the anti-proliferative effect
was only observed in a few human BL cell lines and
growth curves and DNA histograms from FACS analysis
of propidium iodide-labeled samples of the cell lines
showed that Pimi was cytotoxic in Akata cells but only
cytostatic in Daudi and Raji-EBNA6 cells (Figure 3C and
3D).
Pim-1 has been reported to facilitate transcriptional
activation of 20% of Myc transcriptional targets through
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Pimi treatment induces Caspase-3 independent
cell death
Phosphorylation of Bad by Akt or Pim kinases
renders this protein inactive as an inducer of apoptotic
cell death. Since Pimi blocked Bad phosphorylation and
since we observed cells with a sub-G1 DNA content
in Pimi-treated cells, we wanted to investigate if the
cells died by classical caspase-dependent apoptosis.
Immunofluorescense on cells treated with Pimi for 24 and
48 hours with antibodies directed against the cleaved form
of the death effector caspase-3 showed marked increase in
caspase-3 positive cells in Pimi-treated cells (Figure 4A).
This was confirmed by FACS analysis on the same cells
run in parallel. To define which phase of the cell cycle
Pimi-treated cells died in, we performed a FACS analysis
of fixed cells labeled with an antibody targeting cleaved
caspase-3. Co-staining of DNA using 7-aminoactinomycin
D (7-AAD) enabled us to analyze how caspase-3 positive
cells were distributed in the cell cycle. As shown in
Figure 4B, Pimi treatment led to caspase-3 activation in
the G2/M phase (region 4) and in cells with hyperdiploid
DNA content (>4n, region 5), suggesting that cells were
undergoing death because of a problem in mitosis. To test
whether Pimi-induced cell death is caspase-dependent,
the pan-caspase inhibitor QVD-OPH was used together
with Pimi. Immunofluorescense and FACS analyses
showed that QVD-OPH reduces the intensity of caspase-3
staining but does not block Pimi-activated cell death
(Figure 4C). These data indicate that inhibition of Pim
kinases either results in caspase-independent cell death or
that the caspase inhibition required to block death is not
pharmacologically achievable.

Discussion
Here we show that the Pim3 gene contains conserved

E-boxes, one of which is bound by Myc, resulting in
induction of transcription. This is the first time Myc has
been implicated in regulation of a Pim kinase family
member and it explains the high levels of Pim-3 found in
Myc overexpressing mouse B cell lymphomas and human
BL. It may also explain why Pim1 and Pim2 are more
frequently trapped by proviral insertions of retroviruses
in Myc-transgenic mice and why these two genes need to
be deleted in order to see selection for Pim3 trapping [9].
This in turn indicates that Pim-1 and Pim-2 kinases have
non-redundant functions when expressed at normal levels
but that they can be replaced by massive overexpression
of Pim-3. Taken together these data indicate that the

best rationale for developing Pim kinase inhibitors is
to generate pan-inhibitors of all three family members,
especially since triple knockout Pim kinase mice are
viable.
Regulation of the Pim kinase family has focused
mostly on Pim-1 and Pim-2, which are regulated by
the Jak/STAT-pathway and by NfκB [6, 10, 69-75].
Significantly less is known about how Pim-3 expression
is regulated, albeit one report shows that Pim-3 can be
regulated by the Ets family of transcription factors in NIH
3T3 and human Ewing’s sarcoma cells [76]. Later studies
showed that Pim-3 is activated by the Ets-1 transcription
factor in pancreatic cancer cells [77]. Considering that

Pim kinases are constitutively active and protein levels are
mainly regulated through transcriptional activation and
proteosomal degradation [21, 78], our finding that Pim-3
is regulated by Myc represents a significant addition to our
understanding of Pim-3 regulation. It may also constitute
an example of a feed-forward loop, since Pim-3 recently
was shown to stabilize c-Myc [79]. This could offer an
alternative explanation to why Myc’s transcriptional
activity is decreased by Pimi-treatment in Eµ239 cells.
New targeted therapies are needed [80] and
inhibition of Pim kinases has evoked a lot of interest
but thus far no inhibitor has been granted approval for
clinical use. Here we show that Myc-induced B cell
lymphomas are sensitive to a new Pim kinase inhibitor
generated at Abbott Laboratories, Pimi [63]. Whether or
not Pim-3 is the sole target whose inhibition is the cause
of the observed effect is not formally proven since RNAi
against Pim3 yielded incomplete and thereby inconclusive
knockdown data (not shown). Nevertheless, Pimi induces
cell death that correlates with but may be independent
of caspase-3 activation. The reason why we cannot
exclude caspase-dependent death is that there is a debate
whether or not complete caspase inhibition is achievable
pharmacologically [81]. Here we observe a considerable
reduction in cleaved caspase-3 with QVD-OPH but the
remaining amount may be sufficient to trigger death.
If it is not classical caspase-dependent apoptosis then
autophagy and/or programmed necrosis are candidate
mechanisms. Indeed, autophagy was recently shown to
be triggered by Pim-3 inhibition [79]. Given that Myc
regulates metabolism [82] it would be plausible that
interference with Myc’s transcriptional function would
induce major changes in tumor cell metabolism that could
result in apoptosis, autophagy and/or necrosis.

NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection and where cultured
in Dulbecco´s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented
with 10 % fetal calf serum FCS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1
mM sodium pyruvate and 1 x antibiotic-antimycotic
cocktail (penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone; Invitrogen).
Human lymphoma cell lines P493-6 (a kind gift from Dr.
Georg Bornkamm), human Burkitt Lymphoma cell lines;
Akata, BJAB, Daudi, DG75, Louckes, P3HR1, Raji,
Raji-EBNA6 and mouse lymphoma cell lines established
from tumors arising in either λ-Myc or Eµ-Myc transgenic
mice [29, 83] were cultivated in RPMI1640 medium
supplemented with 10 % FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 µM
β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1875 % sodium bicarbonate and 50
µg/ml gentamicin. For Myc-ER experiments cells were
grown in the presence or absence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4-HT) and/or cycloheximide (both from Sigma) for 4 h
followed by RNA harvest and analysis.

Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis
For cell cycle analysis, suspension cells were
harvested by centrifugation after which the pellet was
dissolved in Vindelöv´s solution (10 mM Tris, 10 mM
NaCl, 75 µM propidium iodide, 0.1% Igepal and 700 units/
liter RNase adjusted to pH 8.0) to a final cell concentration
of 1*105 - 1*106 c/ml. The cells were then analyzed in a
FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) plotting
cell cycle distribution in linear mode in the FL3 channel
on the x-axis. Apoptotic cells were analyzed as having
less than a diploid genome and depicted as sub-G1 cells
in a logarithmic FL-2 channel. For cleaved caspase-3
analysis, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde-PBS
and permeabilized in ice-cold 90% methanol. Incubation
with primary antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Cell
signaling) was performed overnight and was followed
by incubation with a FITC-conjugated secondary
antibody (Dako) for 1 h. Cells were then stained with
7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD; Sigma) and analyzed by
FACS analysis on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) using the FL1 (cleaved caspase-3) and FL2
(7-AAD) channels.

Materials and methods
Reagents
Primary antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling (Pim-3 (D17C9), pBad (Ser112, 40A9),
Myc (D84C12), p4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), and Caspase-3
(Asp175)), Santa Cruz (Pim-1(12H8), Pim-2(1D12),
and Myc (N262)), Abcam (Pim-3) and Sigma (β-actin).
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against
mouse and rabbit antibodies were from GE Healthcare
Life Sciences. The pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH
was obtained from Biovision. The Pim inhibitor, Pimi
(2-Dimethylaminomethyl-8-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-3Hbenzo[4,5]thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one), and the nonactive control substance, Pim-ci, were obtained from
Abbott Laboratories.

Protein extraction and western blotting
Cells and harvested lymphomas were snapfrozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ̊C until further
processing. Lymphomas were crushed in liquid nitrogen
before addition of Tween-20 lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes,
pH 7.5 /150 mM NaCl /1 mM EDTA/2.5 mM EGTA/0.1%
Tween-20/ 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/10mM

control for quantitative PCR. Percentage total chromatin
immunoprecipitated was calculated using the equation
% total = 2 (Ct input - Ct ChIP) x % input used for chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP). As positive controls for
Myc transcriptional regulation, primers directed against
the established Myc target genes Srm and Odc were used
in the ChIP assay on λ820 cells, whereas primers against
CCND2 were used for P493-6 cells. Sequences for primers
are available on request.

was pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm (5 minutes, 4
̊C) and supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Protein
concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein
determination kit. 50 μg of protein samples were separated
on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Schleicher-Schuell) activated in deionized
water. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S Red dye
to visualize equal loading and all subsequent steps were
carried out in TBS-Tween (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,
150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) either containing
5% milk (blocking and antibody incubations) or 2 %
BSA (phosphospecific antibody incubations). Antibody
binding was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
using the SuperSignal West Dura or Pico reagents from
Pierce and either an X-ray film or a LAS4000 imaging
system (Fujifilm Lifescience).

Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
Following treatment cells were harvested by cytospin
onto glass slides. The cells were fixed and permeabilized
with a PBS solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde
and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 minutes and then washed
in PBS and blocking solution (5% FCS in PBS). After 1
hour of blocking, primary Caspase-3 antibody in blocking
solution was added, and the slides were incubated
overnight at 4°C in a moisture chamber. The cells were
washed and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)–conjugated secondary antibody and subsequently
stained with Hoechst and mounted. The slides were
analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.
For immunohistochemistry, 2-μm sections of
lymphoma paraffin blocks were deparaffinized. Antigen
retrieval was performed by pressure cooking in citrate
buffer (pH6) for 7min. Primary antibodies against Pim3 (Abcam) were incubated overnight at 4°C. Antibody
detection was performed using the DAKO REALTM
detection kit (DAKO) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

RNA preparation and analysis
RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
or the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel). Synthesis
of cDNA was made with iScript first strand synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad) on 1 μg RNA. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
was performed using the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit
(Kapa Biosystems), cDNA and primers directed against
Pim1, Pim2, Pim3, Srm, Myc, Amd1, Aurkb, Cad, Shmt1,
Shmt2 or Ub (Ubiquitin) on an iCycler iQ5 real-time
PCR machine (Bio-Rad). Relative mRNA levels were
calculated using the ∆∆CTmethod. Primer sequences are
available on request.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

[3H]-thymidine incorporation

P493-6 cells were grown in the presence of 0.1 ug/
ml tetracycline (Myc off) for 72 hours after which they
were cleared of dead cells by centrifugation on a Ficoll
(GE healthcare) gradient. One culture was continuously
cultured in the presence of tetracycline (Myc off) whereas
the other culture was grown in media only (Myc on).
After 8 hours aliquots from each culture were taken
for protein and mRNA analysis and the rest of cells
(approximately 30 *10 6 cells) where cross-linked using 1
% formaldehyde for 10 minutes. λ820 cells were expanded
in normal media to correct cell density and were then
cross-linked and handled as described before. The ChIP
protocol was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (SimpleChIP enzymatic chromatin IP kit,
Cell Signaling). Immunoprecipitations was performed
using Myc antibodies (λ820 cells; D84C12, Cell
Signaling, P493-6 cells; N262, SantaCruz). qPCR was
run on immunoprecipitated and control chromatin using
primers against E-boxes in the mouse and human Pim3 gene. Control primers were designed against a region
outside the Pim3 gene. A 1:50 volume of chromatin
was processed without antibody and used as total input
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 48 h in the
presence of either DMSO or various concentrations of
Pimi. The last 2 h of incubation, 20 μCi of [3H]-thymidine
(Amersham)/ml media was added and the cells were
harvested by a semiautomatic cell harvester (Inotech
CH-5605 Dottikon). [3H]-thymidine incorporation
was measured using a liquid scintillation counter
(PerkinElmer).
