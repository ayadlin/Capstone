Abstract
Certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide (CTX), can enhance the antitumor efficacy of
immunotherapy because of their capacity to modulate innate and adaptive immunity. Indeed, it has been argued
that this capacity may be more significant to chemotherapeutic efficacy in general than is currently appreciated.
To gain insights into the core mechanisms of chemoimmunotherapy, we methodically profiled the effects of CTX
on gene expression in bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood, and on cytokine expression in plasma and bone
marrow of tumor-bearing mice. Gene and protein expression were modulated early and transiently by CTX,
leading to upregulation of a variety of immunomodulatory factors, including danger signals, pattern recognition
receptors, inflammatory mediators, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors. These
factors are involved in sensing CTX myelotoxicity and activating repair mechanisms, which, in turn, stimulate
immunoactivation events that promote efficacy. In particular, CTX induced a T-helper 17 (Th17)-related gene
signature associated with an increase in Th17, Th1, and activated CD25þCD4þFoxp3 T lymphocytes and a slight
recovery of regulatory T cells. By analyzing gene and protein expression kinetics and their relationship to the
antitumor efficacy of different therapeutic schedules of combination, we determined that optimal timing for
performing adoptive immunotherapy is approximately 1 day after CTX treatment. Together, our findings highlight
factors that may propel the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy, offering a mechanistic glimpse of the important
immune modulatory effects of CTX. Cancer Res; 71(10); 3528–39. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Although immunotherapy represents a promising nontoxic
anticancer strategy, the different treatment modalities
employed so far in the clinical setting resulted in limited
and sporadic successes, highlighting the need for the identification of effective strategies to enhance its clinical efficacy
(1). Mounting evidence suggests that combination therapies
may produce synergistic antitumor responses and that certain
chemotherapeutic agents, rather than being immunosuppressive can, under defined conditions, act as strong adjuvants for
either adoptive or active immunotherapy (2, 3). Currently,
cyclophosphamide (CTX) represents the gold standard immunomodulatory chemotherapeutic drug, and the antitumor
efficacy of its combination with immunotherapy has long

been studied in preclinical models (4–7), as well as in clinical
trials (8–11).
Several mechanisms have been considered to explain this
paradoxical phenomenon, among them great relevance was
attributed to the reduction of regulatory T-cell (Treg) number
and function, observed in both the mouse model (12, 13) and
cancer patients (14). Additional CTX-mediated immunoactivating effects include increased tumor infiltration by lymphocytes, functional activation of B and T cells, and homeostatic
proliferation, occurring during the recovery phase that follows
chemotherapy-mediated myelolymphodepletion and that, as a
bystander effect, can promote antitumor immunity (5, 6, 15,
16). Notably, preconditioning the host with CTX also induces
the expression of type I IFN, leading to the expansion of CD4þ
and CD8þ T cells exhibiting a memory phenotype (17). More
recent data indicate that CTX can restore an activated polyfunctional helper phenotype in tumor-specific adoptively
transferred CD4þ T cells through an IFN-a/b-dependent
mechanism (18). Further studies underscore the effects of
this drug not only on the adaptive but also on the innate
immune system. In this regard, it was shown that CTXinduced expansion of vaccine-specific CD8þ T cells is associated with increased number and activation status of dendritic cells (DC; refs. 19, 20).
In a previous study, we had shown that CTX acts through
the production of hitherto unidentified soluble factors

Mechanisms of Antitumor Efficacy of Chemoimmunotherapy

sustaining the proliferation, survival, and activity of transferred lymphocytes (5). Subsequently, we reported that the
synergistic anticancer activity of chemotherapy and immunotherapy was associated with the induction of a "cytokine
storm," occurring primarily in the bone marrow of treated
mice (16). Upregulated factors included hematopoietic
growth factors [granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-1b], cytokines regulating homeostatic expansion and memory CD8þ T-cell survival (IL-7, IL-15, IL-2, and IL-21) and cytokines involved in
the polarization toward a T-helper (Th)1 type of immune
response (IFN-g). The present study aims at investigating
the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory activity
of CTX by means of genomic and proteomic approaches. In
particular, we evaluated the effect of CTX on the gene
expression of bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the protein levels of 32
cytokines in plasma and bone marrow lysates of tumorbearing mice at different times after a single chemotherapeutic treatment. The overall results provide new insights
into the mechanisms by which CTX can render immune
lymphocytes capable of eradicating metastatic tumors and
provide a scientific rationale for performing adoptive immunotherapy early after chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Animals, tumor cells, and chemoimmunotherapy
Six- to 7-week-old DBA/2 mice (Harlan) were implanted
with 2  106 IFN-a/b-resistant, in vivo passaged, highly
metastatic 3Cl-8 Friend leukemia cells (3Cl-8 FLC; ref. 21).
CTX (Sigma–Aldrich) was administered intraperitoneally
4 days after tumor injection. Five hours later, some mice
received the adoptive transfer of 40  106 lymphomonocytes
derived from spleens of tumor-immunized mice, prepared as
in ref. 16. Vaccination was carried out with IFN-a-producing
tumor cells (IFN-a1-Cl-11; ref. 22). Mice were vaccinated with
either irradiated (100 Gy) cells or a tumor lysate obtained from
3 freeze-thaw cycles. Vaccination was carried out twice (3
times for lysates) at a time interval of 2 weeks. The experimental protocols were approved by the Istituto Superiore di
Sanita Review Board.
RNA isolation, labeling, and hybridization
Total RNA was obtained by TRIZOL reagent extraction
(Invitrogen) for spleens and by RNeasy (Qiagen) purification
for bone marrow cells (femurs and tibias) and PBMC
(obtained by gradient centrifugation with Lympholyte-Mammals-Cederlane).
Amino-allyl modified antisense RNA (aRNA) was synthesized in 1 amplification round from 2 mg total RNA by using
the Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit
(Ambion), in accordance with manufacturer's instructions,
and its quality was assessed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies). aRNAs were coupled to monoreactive Cy3 or
Cy5 dyes (GE Healthcare), fragmented (RNA Fragmentation
Reagents, Ambion), mixed, and cohybridized overnight in
humidifying chambers at 42 C onto prehybridizated micro-

array slides, and printed with 13,443 70mer oligonucleotides
(Operon version 1.1; CRIBI Microarray Service, University of
Padua, Italy). The platform has been submitted to the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession GPL5098).
Data analysis
Scanning and image file processing were carried out with
the GenePix 4200A instrument (Axon Instruments), and the
obtained data were filtered with BRB ArrayTool (23) to
exclude spots below a minimum intensity (200), flagged
and with diameters less than 25 mm and normalized by using
Lowess Smoother. Only genes expressed in 70% of samples
were analyzed in subsequent statistical analyses (all done by
using the log2-tranformed ratios).
Average linkage unsupervised hierarchical clustering, with
Pearson correlation distance measure, was carried out with
genes whose expression differed by at least 1.5-fold from the
median in at least 20% of samples. Following median centering, results were visualized with Treeview software (24).
Statistically significant (P  0.001) differentially expressed
genes between posttherapy and pretreatment samples were
identified with supervised class comparison (parametric ttest) and further analyzed by using Cluster and TreeView
softwares.
Gene annotation and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes) pathway analyses were carried out by means of
DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) bioinformatic tool (25). Enriched biological
processes and pathways were ranked according to EASE score,
indicating the abundance of genes fitting each class in proportion to the number of genes expected to be in each class by
chance, calculated on the global composition of the array.
Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry
Splenocytes were stratified over Lympholyte-M Gradient
(Cederlane) for lymphocyte enrichment. For Treg and activated CD4þ lymphocyte analyses, cells were stained with antiCD4-FITC and anti-CD25-PE (BD Biosciences), and fixed,
permeabilized, and stained with anti-Foxp3-APC according
to the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience).
For Th1 and Th17 analyses, cells were stimulated overnight
with 100 ng/mL PMA and 1 mg/mL Ionomycin, in the presence
of 1 mg/mL Brefeldin-A and 0.7 mg/mL Monensin (GolgiPlug,
GolgiStop, BD-Bioscience) to prevent cytokine secretion. Following staining with anti-CD4-FITC, cells were fixed and
permeabilized, and intracellular staining was carried out by
using anti-IFN-g-PE-Cy7 and anti-IL-17-APC (e-Bioscience).
Acquisition and analysis were carried out with FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD-Bioscience) and FlowJo software. Production of IFN-g and IL-17 was evaluated in CD4þ in both
unstimulated (data not shown) and PMA/I stimulated samples.
Multiplex proteomic analysis of cytokines, chemokines,
and growth factors
bone marrow cells were obtained from femurs and tibias.
After lysing erythrocytes through a 3-minute incubation in
0.16 mol/L Tris-buffered NH4Cl (pH 7.2), cells were lysed in

The combination of CTX and adoptive immunotherapy
results in complete tumor regression
A highly metastatic tumor model, 3Cl-8 FLC (21), was used
to assess the antitumor effectiveness of the combination of a
single CTX injection and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of
lymphomonocytes from tumor-vaccinated syngeneic mice,
according to previously published protocols (5). Donor mice
were vaccinated with either irradiated (Fig. 1A) or lysed
(Fig. 1B) IFN-a–producing tumor cells (IFN-a1-Cl-11), based
on the fact that these cells were shown to be effective cancer
vaccines (22).
ACT alone had no significant effect on tumor growth (Fig. 1)
and mouse survival (data not shown), whereas CTX alone
induced a transient delay in tumor growth but ultimately
tumors developed in all mice. In contrast, the sequential treatment with CTX and ACT from mice vaccinated with irradiated

IFN-a1-Cl-11 resulted in complete tumor regression in 100% of
mice with no recurrences or metastases (Fig. 1A). ACT from
nonvaccinated mice had no effect either alone or in combination with CTX (data not shown). Noteworthy, when chemotherapy was followed by ACT from tumor lysate-vaccinated mice,
tumor growth was delayed (more than with CTX alone), but no
tumor regressed (Fig. 1B). These results, along with previously
published data (5, 16), show that the therapeutic effectiveness of
this chemoimmunotherapy approach depends on CTXmediated immunomodulatory mechanisms potentiating adoptive immunotherapy and that also the quality of the antitumor
immunity induced in donor mice has an impact on the outcome. Irradiated tumor cells may, in fact, still produce IFN-a,
which influences the quality of the vaccine-induced immune
response (26). In addition, irradiation has been shown to induce
an immunogenic cell death leading to optimal immunization of
mice against subsequent tumor challenge (27).
Global gene expression analysis of the effects of CTX on
bone marrow, spleen, and PBMC
To gain insights into the CTX-mediated effects responsible
for the antitumor efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy, we evaluated the impact of a single CTX treatment on the gene
expression of primary (bone marrow) and secondary (spleen)
lymphoid organs and of PBMC. Microarray analysis, evaluating the expression of 13,443 genes, was carried out before (ctr)
and at different times (1, 2, and 5 days) after chemotherapy.
The experiment was carried out in tumor-bearing mice to take
into account the possible immunomodulation induced by the
tumor implant itself. The data discussed in this article have
been deposited in National Center for Biotechnology
Information's GEO and are accessible through GEO Series
accession number GSE27440 (28).
To get an overall picture of the transcriptional modulation
by CTX and of its kinetics, data were preliminarily subjected to
unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis (Fig. 2A). In both
lymphoid organs and PBMC, this analysis segregated samples
into 2 principal clusters reflecting distinct gene expression
patterns, one including ctr and samples taken 5 days posttreatment and the other containing samples from day 1 and 2,
showing that CTX has a strong impact on gene expression,
inducing at early time points (1–2 days) the modulation of
a large number of genes, that, however, return to baseline by
day 5.
To identify genes undergoing a statistically significant differential expression, microarray data were reanalyzed by using
a supervised approach (class comparison), followed by clustering analysis. Class comparison was conducted gathering in one
class samples from day 1 and 2 and comparing them with ctr
samples, based on the fact that, on separate comparisons
between day 1, day 2, and day 5 versus ctr, most genes undergoing a statistically significant modulation of expression at
day 1 showed a similar profile at day 2 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
In the bone marrow, 1 to 2 days after CTX administration,
the expression of 1,123 genes was significantly (P  0.001)
modulated with respect to ctr (580 overexpressed and 543
downregulated; Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S1). Most
transcripts returned to baseline levels at day 5.

Figure 2. Gene expression profiles induced by CTX in bone marrow (BM; 5 mice), spleen (5 mice), and PBMC (4 pools of 4 mice) of tumor-bearing mice.
RNA was isolated either before (ctr; indicated as sample A in the dendrograms) or at day 1 (sample B), day 2 (sample C), and day 5 (sample D) after CTX
treatment. After amplification, aRNAs were labeled with Cy5, mixed with Cy3-labeled "reference" aRNA (from a pool of the BM of untreated mice) and
hybridized to 13.5 k oligonucleotide-based microarray. Each oligonucleotide was spotted as duplicate on the slide allowing technical replicates for
each sample (indicated as -a and -b). A, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of genes displayed a 1.5-fold change from the median expression value for that
gene in no less than 20% of samples. B, cluster analyses of statistically significantly (P  0.001) modulated genes. Class comparison (BRB-ArrayTools)
was carried out gathering in one class samples taken 1 and 2 days following CTX treatment and comparing them to ctr samples. The result of a
global permutation test (which indicates the probability of selecting those numbers of genes if there were no real differences between the classes) was zero.
Treeview software was used for visualization of results. For each gene, expression levels above or below the median are shown in red or green, respectively.

In case of spleen, 868 genes were significantly differentially
expressed at day 1–2 (445 overexpressed and 423 downregulated; Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S2). Noteworthy, day 5
samples were more similar to day 1–2 samples than to ctr,
indicating that gene expression changes in the spleen are
more durable than in the bone marrow.
In PBMC, 1,084 genes were significantly modulated by CTX
(557 overexpressed and 527 downregulated), all of which went
back to baseline by day 5 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S3).
Functional classification of genes differentially

KEGG pathway analysis
To characterize the observed transcriptional profiles
according to biological function and to identify functional
and molecular pathways involved in CTX-mediated immunomodulation, the lists of upregulated and downregulated genes

www.aacrjournals.org

were subjected to gene ontology–based and KEGG pathwaybased annotation by means of the DAVID bioinformatic tool
(29). Interestingly, the biological processes found to be more
significantly (P  0.05) stimulated by CTX in the bone marrow
included genes regulating defense response, developmental
processes, and response to external/chemical stimuli (see
Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4, for a detailed list of
upregulated genes). The most significantly represented KEGG
pathways included chemokine and B-cell-receptor (BCR) signaling pathways, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, and
apoptosis (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Both
analyses indicated that upregulated genes comprised mostly
immune-related genes.
Increased transcripts included several chemokines, that is,
CCL21C, CCL21B (ligands for CCR7), CXCL2 (MIP-2, chemotactic for polymorphonuclear leukocytes and hematopoietic
stem cells, HSC), CXCL7 (proplatelet basic protein) and

CXCL12, (chemoattractant for CD133þHSC). Upregulated chemokine receptors included CCR6, CCR9, and IL8RB (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Tables S1 and S4). Of note, CTX treatment
also induced increased expression of genes involved in cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways (JAK3, GRK6, PIK3CG,
VAV2, IKBKG, and NFkB; Supplementary Fig. S3A). Accordingly, IL1B (IL-1b) and NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2), important mediators of inflammation, were upregulated
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S4).
In addition, the receptors for granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF; CSF3R), for VEGF (FLT1, KDR), and for TNF–
related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; TNFRSF10B) were
upregulated at day 1–2. Noticeably, the upregulation of IL17B
and of its receptor IL17R was accompanied by increased expression of IL1B, of the receptor for TGF-b (TGFBR2), and of FOXH1
and GREM1 (TGF-b signaling pathway), which are essential for
Th17 differentiation (30; Supplementary Tables S1 and S4).
Among the immune-related genes that CTX induced in the
bone marrow, we also found immunoglobulin heavy chain-2
(IGH-2) CD22 (BCR coreceptor), and BCR signaling molecules
(VAV2, PIK3CG, NFkB; Supplementary Fig. S3B). Moreover,
calreticulin (CALR), whose exposure is required for the immunogenicity of cell death, 2 alarmins (DEFB2 and DEFCR4), the
stress response factor (HSF2), and several soluble and cellassociated pattern recognition receptors (PRR) responsible for
the recognition of apoptotic/necrotic cells, such as mannose
binding lectin (MBL1), FCN1 (ficolin A), PFC (complement
protein properdin), and complement component C1q subunits (C1QA and C1QB), were upregulated 1 to 2 days after
treatment (Supplementary Tables S1 and S4).
The functional classification of downregulated genes
showed that the most significantly enriched biological classes
included genes regulating cell division, RNA processing, metabolic processes, establishment of cellular localization, and
chromosome segregation (Table 1). These results suggest that
CTX induces the reduction of biosynthetic/metabolic processes and cell cycle presumably as a consequence of its
cytotoxic activity and that, at the same time, it stimulates
the expression of a plethora of immune-related genes.
Functional classification of genes differentially
expressed in spleen and PBMC by gene ontology
and KEGG pathway analysis
As is the case with bone marrow, the most significantly
enriched biological classes of genes upregulated in the spleen
were related to the regulation of immune response, whereas
cell cycle, chromosome segregation, and metabolic process
classes were enriched for downregulated genes (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S4). Also, KEGG pathway enrichment
analysis showed a great similarity between bone marrow and
spleen, because enriched pathways included chemokine and
BCR signaling pathways, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, and apoptosis. In addition, in the spleen lysosome and
TGF-b signaling pathways were also enriched (Fig. 3B and
Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5).
Within immune-related transcripts, some were increased
also in bone marrow (CCL21C, CXCL7, CXCL12, IL1B, CD22,
TGFBR2), whereas others were peculiarly overexpressed in the

Figure 3. Plots illustrating KEGG pathways significantly enriched within genes upregulated by CTX and Venn diagrams indicating the degree of
overlap between gene expression profiles of bone marrow (BM), spleen, and PBMC. (A, B, C) The genes upmodulated 1–2 days after CTX treatment were
clustered in different KEGG pathways by using DAVID and the significantly enriched pathways (P  0.05, EASE score) are shown for BM (A), spleen
(B), and PBMC (C). The lists of genes significantly up- (D) and downregulated (E) 1–2 days following CTX treatment were used to create the Venn diagrams. The
number of genes exhibiting common (or uncommon) modulation of expression in each tissue is shown.

spleen, such as the C-type lectin receptors (CLR) CLEC4A2
(DCIR), CD209B (SIGNR-1), CLEC4N (Dectin-2), and CLEC7A
(Dectin-1), involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells by DC, and
genes involved in CLR signal-transduction pathway (SYK, BCL10). Noteworthy, PTX3, which inhibits the capture of apoptotic
cells by DC, was downregulated after treatment. Moreover, we
observed the induction of genes associated with various
processes of DNA repair, cell death, autophagy, and drug
resistance (DDIT4, HIF1A, CLU, ATG7, HSP70–2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S4).
Additional upregulated genes comprised AHR (regulator of
Treg and Th17 cell differentiation), factors regulating inflammation (IL-1 family members IL1B, IL1R1, IL1RAP) and cell
proliferation (TNFSF13-APRIL, TNFSF13B-BAFF), and growth
factors acting on different cell populations (FGF1, HBEGF,
IGF1, PDGFB, VEGFA; Supplementary Fig. S4 and Tables S2
and S4). Noticeably, IL2RG (IL-2 receptor g chain), which is
involved in the response to homeostatic cytokines IL-2, IL-7,
IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, was overexpressed following treatment,
corroborating previous findings indicating that CTX increases
the expression of homeostatic cytokines (16).
Although in PBMC no significant enrichment of any biological process class was found within upregulated genes, we
could identify some cytokine-encoding transcripts (IL12A,

www.aacrjournals.org

IL1F8, IL17A). As is the case with the spleen, CTX induced
the expression of CD164 (expressed by primitive HSC), of the
CLR CD209B and of HIF1A (Supplementary Table S3). Only one
biological process (establishment of cellular localization) was
enriched within downregulated genes (data not shown). Moreover, the results of KEGG pathway analysis were not similar to
to those for bone marrow or spleen (Fig. 3C).
To directly compare the correspondence of bone marrow,
spleen, and PBMC transcriptional profiles, the overlap of the
gene lists was examined in Venn diagrams. Interestingly, the
spleen displayed a profile intermediate between bone marrow and PBMC, which were the least similar to each other
(Fig. 3D and E); this could be related to the fact that, in mice,
the spleen is an active hematopoietic organ and, at the same
time, comprises fully mature cells. The most significantly
enriched biological classes of genes simultaneously upregulated in bone marrow and spleen were defense response and
response to stress and to external stimuli (data not shown).
Altogether these results suggest that hematopoietic organs
(spleen and bone marrow) are the most responsive organs to
the damage mediated by CTX and react to it by activating
immune-related genes.
To validate the results obtained by transcriptional profiling,
the expression of selected genes was assessed by real-time

FL4-H: IL-17

Figure 4. Effect of CTX treatment on CD4þ T-cell subsets. A, representative FACS analysis (out of 2 independent experiments) showing the effect of
CTX on the absolute number of IFN-g-producing (Th1), IL-17-producing (Th17), and activated (CD4þCD25þFoxp3) T-helper cells and Treg cells
(CD4þCD25þFoxp3þ) in the spleen. Analyses were conducted by gating on lymphocytes. Results are shown as fold change of absolute numbers of each cell
subtype with respect to untreated mice. Data represent the mean fold change of 3 individual mice versus 3 untreated mice. *, P  0.05, unpaired t-test.

PCR. In accordance with the results obtained by microarray,
CARL and CLU transcript levels were augmented early after
treatment in bone marrow and spleen (but not in PBMC).
Moreover, although the expression of IL1B was increased at
day 2 and decreased at day 5 in all tissues, CDCA8 was
downregulated at day 2 and returned to baseline by day 5
(Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Methods).
Effect of CTX on T-helper subpopulations
Because Th17 cells were shown to exert a protective role
against murine cancer by providing a more significant help
than Th1 cells for tumor-specific CD8þ T cells (31), the novel
observation of a Th17-related gene signature induced by CTX
prompted us to evaluate, in the spleen, the modulation of this
T-cell subtype at different times following CTX injection. The
modulation of Th1, Th17, Tregs (CD4þ/CD25þ/Foxp3þ), and
activated CD4þ T cells (CD4þ/CD25þ/Foxp3) was examined
simultaneously by intracellular staining followed by FACS
analysis. Interestingly, the absolute numbers of IFN-g– and
IL-17–producing CD4þ T cells and those of activated CD4þ/
CD25þ/Foxp3 lymphocytes underwent a transient decrease
7 days following chemotherapy and were significantly (P 
0.05) augmented above the levels of untreated mice at day 10
and 14 (Fig. 4A). Th1, as expected, showed the most pronounced expansion, reaching a 6-fold increase compared with
untreated mice, and Th17 and activated CD4þ T cells underwent a 2.5 and a 3.8 increment, respectively. We did not find
CD4þ T cells coexpressing IL-17 and IFN-g (data not shown).
In contrast, Treg cell numbers, although showing kinetics of
depletion similar to those of the other CD4þ subpopulations,

3534

Cancer Res; 71(10) May 15, 2011

exhibited a lower rebound, evident at a later time (significant
only at day 14; Fig. 4A). These results indicate that CTX
induces an imbalance in CD4þ T-cell subtypes, favoring
effective immunity and disadvantaging tolerance, and corroborate recent findings suggesting that CTX induces Th17 cells
in cancer patients (32). However, it should be noted that Tregs
are only held back with respect to other CD4þ populations,
because their number is anyway restored to pretreatment
level, indicating that this is a transient imbalance and not a
permanent depletion. In Fig. 4B, the effect of CTX on lymphocytes and CD4þ T cells is shown. CTX injection induced a
transient depletion of lymphocytes followed by a rebound of
their number above baseline without significantly altering the
proportion of CD4þ T cells (Fig. 4B).
CTX treatment stimulates a "storm" of
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors
To characterize the cytokine response to CTX at the protein
level, plasma and bone marrow lysates from tumor-bearing
mice were subjected to Bio-Plex cytokine assays, which
allowed the simultaneous analysis of 32 analytes.
Three days (7 for IL-9) after chemotherapy, the levels of
IL-3, IL-5, IL-9, CCL2, CCL4, CCL11, G-CSF, and GM-CSF
were significantly (P  0.05) increased in plasma with
respect to untreated mice, whereas IL-12, CXCL2, and
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were
reduced (Fig. 5A, B, and C).
Regarding the bone marrow, CTX induced a transient
depletion of cell numbers (and accordingly of their total
protein content) at day 3, and a rebound, overcoming baseline,

Days after tumor implant

at day 10 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Nevertheless, the analysis of
cytokine expression per cell, that is, after normalizing the
concentration of each cytokine to the number of cells at each
time point, showed that the amount of several cytokines (IL1b, IL-9, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and IFN-g) increased significantly
(P  0.05) at day 3 and went back to baseline or below baseline
by day 7 (Fig. 5D). Noticeably, the chemokines CCL2, CCL3,
CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, and LIF and the growth
factors platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-basic, fibroblast
growth factor (FGF)-2, M-CSF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF followed
the same kinetics (Fig. 5E-F). Of note, in both plasma and bone
marrow, the majority of protein expression changes took place
early (day 3), immediately following gene expression modulation (day 1 and 2) and preceding the recovery of cell numbers
and, as for transcript, the protein expression modulation was
transient.
These data not only represented the validation at the
protein levels of some of the changes in gene expression
assessed either by microarray analysis (i.e., IL-1b, CXCL2,
PDGF, FGF) or previously by real-time PCR (IL-15, IFN-g,
GM-CSF; ref. 16), but also further expanded this information pointing out the many cytokines, chemokines, and
growth factors regulating the recovery of bone marrow
cells after the myelosuppressive stress exerted by CTX
and constituting the microenvironment capable of supporting HSC proliferation, differentiation, and mobilization to
the circulation.

Cancer Res; 71(10) May 15, 2011

The antitumor efficacy of the combined therapy
depends on the timing of combination
The kinetics of gene and protein expression modulation
showed that CTX-mediated immunomodulation is induced
early after treatment and rapidly turned off. On the basis of
these results, we investigated whether the timing of optimal
combination of CTX and ACT was congruent, and possibly
dependent, on the kinetics. As shown in Fig. 6, the antitumor
efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy was maximal when ACT
was carried out either 5 hours or 1 day after chemotherapy (i.
e., at the time of the majority of gene expression changes),
resulting in the cure of 5 out of 6 and 4 out of 6 tumor-bearing
mice, respectively, and was completely lost if donor cells were
infused 3 days after chemotherapy, indicating that transferred
cells should be infused as early as possible to enable the
benefit of the CTX-mediated cytokine milieu.

Discussion
Different studies have addressed systematically the effects
of CTX on several of the multiple cells and factors driving
tumor-induced tolerance and antitumor immunity (reviewed
in ref. 2). However, such hypothesis-driven approaches,
although deeply clarifying the contribution of each single
actor, do not take into account the complexity of CTXmediated immunomodulation. High-throughput analyses,
such as genomics and proteomics, can efficiently complement

Mechanisms of Antitumor Efficacy of Chemoimmunotherapy

these type of studies, giving a comprehensive picture of a
complex situation, uncovering unknown factors and driving
new hypotheses. Previously, the antitumor efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy was believed to mainly rely on the induction of lymphopenia by chemotherapy, which creates "room"
for the adoptive transfer of tumor-specific lymphocytes (10,
11), or on the selective depletion of Tregs (12, 14). Although
CTX indeed depletes Tregs in vivo, we and others have shown
that these cells can repopulate the periphery (Fig. 4; ref. 33),
highlighting the transient and possibly limiting nature of this
hypothesis. We argued that the tolerogenic milieu induced by
tumors is multifactorial and includes Tregs as well as other
factors and that CTX conditioning can not only mitigate
tolerogenic mechanisms but also produce a multifactorial
immunogenic milieu favoring immunotherapeutic interventions. Consistent with such a view, the present study was
designed to unravel the multiple factors underlying the ability
of CTX to potentiate cancer immunotherapy. Taken together,
microarray analyses show that CTX modulates the expression
of an unexpectedly high number of genes in lymphoid organs,
leading on one hand to the downregulation of genes involved
in cell cycle and metabolic processes, which is in accordance
with the inherent toxicity of an anticancer agent, and, on the
other hand, to the upmodulation of immunomodulatory
genes. An important finding, stemming from both genomic
and proteomic analyses, is that CTX-mediated immunomodulation is early and transient, as previously shown in a
different tumor model (RBL-5 lymphoma), by real-time PCR
analyses of a limited panel of cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-1 b, IL-7,
IL-15, IL-2, IL-21, IL-13, and IFN-g); ref. 16). These data point
out that, to be effective, chemotherapy and immunotherapy
should be combined within a short time window. Remarkably,
this hypothesis was confirmed by tumor growth experiments
showing that the synergistic antitumor effectiveness of CTX
and ACT strictly depends on the timing of combination and is
progressively lost as days pass between 1 treatment and the
other (Fig. 6).
Recent data suggest that the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy (especially anthracyclines) depends on the induction of immunogenic apoptosis of tumor cells that stimulate
antitumor immunity (34). Key elements dictating the immunogenicity of anthracycline-mediated cell death are the surface exposure of CARL and the release of HMGB1, which, in
turn, activate TLR-4 (27). Studies from our group showed that
CTX induces CARL exposure and release of DC-activating
soluble factors by apoptotic tumor cells, resulting in increased
cross-presentation of tumor antigens to CD8þ T cells (35).
Here we show for the first time that CTX can augment, in bone
marrow cells, the simultaneous expression of CARL and of 2
PRRs (MBL1 and C1Q) involved in its recognition and in
apoptotic cell clearance (36). In addition, CTX augmented
the transcript levels of other danger signals, that is, the
alarmins DEFCR4 (defensin-a-4) and DEFB2 (defensin-b-2),
the first involved in macrophage and T-cell chemoattraction
and the second able to induce DC maturation via TLR-4 (the
same receptor of HMGB1; ref. 37).
Interestingly, additional DC-specific CLRs were upregulated
in the spleen, namely SIGNR1 and DCIR, involved in CD8þ T-

cell cross-priming (38) and Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, whose role
in the clearance of apoptotic cells has been recently underscored (39), and that, after ligand engagement, are able to
induce DC activation and Th1/Th17 differentiation via a SYKdependent signaling pathway that leads to the activation of
NFkB (40–42). Strikingly, the upregulation of Dectins was
associated with increased expression of SYK and of the
adaptor BCL-10. Of note, it is possible to speculate that the
Th17 signature induced by CTX and the expansion of Th1 and
Th17 cells observed in the rebound phase after chemotherapy
depends on the activation of this signaling pathway after
"sensing" the damage of chemotherapy by PRR. In this regard,
early after CTX injection, we observed the induction of genes
associated with DNA repair, cell death, autophagy, and drug
resistance (DDIT4, HIF1A, CLU, ATG7, and HSP70–2; ref. 43–
45).
In physiologic settings, the engulfment of apoptotic cells by
phagocytes inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines and
leads to T-cell tolerance. The perception of danger signals may
have a role in tipping the balance from tolerance to inflammation and effective T-cell activation (46). Accordingly, we
show here that after CTX treatment several IL-1 family
members are upregulated in the spleen and both transcript
and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-17,
IL-18, IFN-g, LIF) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5;
ref. 47) are augmented in bone marrow. Remarkably, IL-1b and
IL-18, the most important mediators of inflammation, control
innate and adaptive (including Th1-Th17) responses (48).
Moreover, CTX increased the expression of NOS2, an enzyme
responsible for the generation of free radical NO and involved
in inflammation, the expression of which has been shown to
be triggered by IL-17 via the transcription factor NFkB (49).
The proinflammatory action of IL-17 induces the expression of
target genes such as CXCL1, CXCL2, and defensins (50), which
were indeed augmented in bone marrow and plasma. IL-17 is
also an important modulator of hematopoiesis through the
induction of GM-CSF, G-CSF, and CCL2 (51), which were
augmented in bone marrow lysates and plasma. Moreover,
HIF1A and its target gene VEGFA levels were increased in the
spleen, which is in accordance with data showing that CTX
induces hypoxia along with HIF1A and VEGFA upregulation,
playing a key role in inflammation and hematopoiesis (52).
The hypothesis stemming from these data is that CTX
induces an immunogenic apoptosis not only of tumor cells
but also of host bone marrow and spleen cells and, at the same
time, activates inflammatory mediators, leading to the promotion of hematopoiesis and immune response. In accordance with this hypothesis, the apoptosis of self T cells was
shown to elicit self-reactive CD8þ T cells, thus inducing a
systemic immunoactivation during HIV infection (53). This
premise also suggests that CTX may be suitable for enhancing
the efficacy of immunotherapy in adjuvant settings, in which
mounting an effective vaccine-induced antitumor immunity
in the absence of tumor burden is fundamental to prevent
recurrences. In this regard, we have recently shown that
dacarbazine, an alkylating agent similar to CTX, can enhance
CD8þ memory T-cell responses to peptide-based vaccination
in resected melanoma patients (54).

Moschella et al.

We have previously shown that the antitumor effectiveness
of chemoimmunotherapy depends on adoptively transferred
CD4þ T cells (16) and, among them, Th17 was proved to
exhibit a stronger therapeutic efficacy than Th1 (31). Several
authors reported differential effects of CTX on CD4þ T cells,
including a Th2 to Th1 shift in cytokine production (16, 55).
The present data reveal for the first time that CTX induces an
environment simultaneously favoring Th1, Th17, and activated CD4þ T cells, suggesting that this milieu may condition
not only host cells but also transferred tumor-specific CD4þ
T cells, thus leading to improved tumor control.
Taken together, our data sustain the fascinating hypothesis that CTX-mediated immunomodulation stems directly
from its cytotoxicity that produces DNA damage, cell cycle
arrest, and cell homeostasis perturbation not only of tumor
cells but also of host highly proliferating cells, such as bone
marrow and splenocytes. DNA-damage responses are complex and involve "sensor" proteins perceiving danger and
transmitting signals to "transducer" proteins, which, in turn,
convey signals to "effector" factors (56). Cells damaged or
killed by CTX within lymphoid organs would therefore
expose/release danger signals that in turn, through PRR
signaling, would transiently activate proinflammatory pathways and create a beneficial environment aimed at repairing
the damage and able, as a bystander effect, to promote
innate and adaptive immunity, including Th1 and Th17
responses. When an immune intervention (vaccination or
ACT) is carried out during the recovery phase, also tumorspecific immune cells can take advantage of this drug-

mediated immunomodulation. Although with the present
experimental design we could not ascertain in which cell
subtype the expression of a certain gene or protein was
modulated, this study describes for the first time all the
sensor, transducer, and effector factors involved in the host
response to CTX, opens novel hypotheses that may guide
further experimentation, and, lastly, supplies a clear-cut
indication of the short time window in which chemotherapy
and ACT should be combined to maximize chemoimmunotherapy effectiveness against cancer.
