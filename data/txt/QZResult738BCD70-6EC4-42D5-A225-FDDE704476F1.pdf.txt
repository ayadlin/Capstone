Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable plasma cell malignancy and drug
resistance persists as the major cause of treatment failure leading to fatal outcomes.
The phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is constitutively hyperactivated in
MM to promote disease progression and drug resistance. While inhibiting PI3K induces
apoptosis in MM and is predicted to increase tumor susceptibility to anticancer therapy,
early-generation pan-PI3K inhibitors display poor clinical efficacy as well as intolerable
side effects. Here, we found that PI3K activity is significantly upregulated in MM cell
lines and patient tumor cells resistant to bortezomib and that the majority of PI3K
activity in MM cells is dependent upon the p110-δ isoform. Genetic or pharmacologic
inhibition of p110-δ substantially reduced myeloma viability and enhanced cellular
sensitivity to bortezomib. Chemical library screens then identified a novel compound,
DT97, that potently inhibited p110-δ kinase activity and induced apoptosis in MM cells.
DT97 was evaluated in the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cell types and anticancer
activity was greatest against MM, leukemia and lymphoma cells. Co-treatment with
DT97 and bortezomib synergistically induced apoptosis in MM patient cells and
overcame bortezomib-resistance. Although bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) promote
MM growth, the pro-survival effects of BMSCs were significantly reduced by DT97
treatment. Co-treatment with bortezomib and DT97 reduced the growth of myeloma
xenotransplants in murine models and prolonged host survival. Taken together,
the results provide the basis for further clinical evaluation of p110-δ inhibitors, as
monotherapy or in synergistic combinations, for the benefit of MM patients.

Introduction

dependency, and consequently, exquisite sensitivity to
certain PI3K inhibitors. Controlling key growth-promoting
pathways with small molecule drugs is an emerging
strategy that can improve treatment of MM patients.
Class I PI3Ks consist of regulatory subunit (p85 or
p101) bound to a catalytic subunit of the class 1A (p110-α,
-β, and -δ) or class 1B (p110-γ) isoforms [9]. The genes
PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD and PIK3CG express the
PI3K/p110-δ, β, γ and δ isoforms. Expression of p110-γ
is largely restricted to leukocytes, whereas the expression
of p110-α and p110-β appears ubiquitous. PIK3CA,
PIK3CB, PIK3CD or PIK3CG gene mutations in MM
cells have not been reported [10–12]. PI3K inhibitors

Despite recent advances in understanding
myelomagenesis and the discovery of proteasome
inhibitors (PIs) and immunomodulatory agents, the
majority of multiple myeloma (MM) patients continue to
have a relapse and MM remains nearly uniformly fatal
[1–3]. Drug resistance is a common cause of poor patient
outcome, however, the precise mechanisms that underlie
drug resistance remain poorly defined and effective
strategies to prevent or revert resistance are lacking [4–8].

have shown promise in mouse models of cancer and led
to the development of multiple agents currently being
evaluated in clinical trials. The PI3K isoforms appear to
fulfill distinct roles during physiologic and pathologic
conditions, suggesting that isoform-specific inhibitors
may more target tumor growth [13, 14]. Moreover, panPI3K inhibitors have not been successful in clinical
studies and have yielded numerous adverse effects in
patients. Therefore, inhibitors that are selective for a
single PI3K isoform may offer more refined activity
with reduced adverse effects. p110-δ has a crucial role
in a plethora of leukocyte and B cell functions, including
proliferation, antibody secretion, survival and migration
[15–18]. Genetic or pharmacologic inactivation of p110-δ
demonstrates its critical importance in B-cell signaling and
survival [19–23].
We sought to identify small molecules that inhibited
p110-δ activity and potentiated the anti-myeloma effect
of bortezomib. Our studies were fueled by the remarkable
success of the FDA-approved p110-δ inhibitor idelalisib
(Zydelig®) that exhibits significant activity for the
treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
relapsed of follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)
or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) [19]. However,
idelalisib is not effective in treating MM and can generate
numerous severe, adverse effects [21]. Development of
p110-δ inhibitors that overcome the drawbacks associated
with current p110-δ-targeting drugs and that are effective
in MM patients represents an urgent and unmet need.

to bortezomib treatment (Figure 1B). PI3K kinase
activity was greater in CD138+ cells from bortezomib
non-responders compared to bortezomib responders.
RPMI8226 cells resistant to PIs were generated as
described [38] and results indicated that PI3K activity was
also greater in cells the cells resistant to PIs -resistant cells
compared to those that were drug-naïve (Figure 1C).

RESULTS

High-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical
libraries represents a systematic and inexpensive method
to rapidly identify novel compounds that specifically
inhibit protein targets that promote or maintain tumor
growth. Based upon the comparison of chemical structures
for the pan-PI3K inhibitor GSK2126458 and the p110δ-specific inhibitor CAL-101, we performed virtual
screening to identify novel chemical compounds that
potentially inhibited p110-δ kinase activity (Figure 3A).
Virtual screening of 360,000 compounds in the
University of Cincinnati Drug Discovery Library was
performed using the Accelrys Pipeline Pilot Software.
Similarity searches compared the molecular fingerprints
of chemical compounds to those of the pan-PI3K and
p110-δ inhibitors. The top 96 compounds identified in
the screen were then obtained and tested for ability to
reduce the viability of myeloma cells in a cell-based
in vitro assay using RPMI8226 cells (Figure 3B). The antimyeloma effect of the 96 compounds was simultaneously
compared to a panel of 68 known PI3K/AKT/mTOR
inhibitors. We identified the most potent compounds that
exhibited anti-myeloma activity and that also reduced
PIP3 production. In this manner, we identified several
promising hits with diverse scaffolds that ultimately
led to the identification of our lead compound, DT97
(Figure 3C). DT97, (N-[4-hydroxy-3-(8-quinolinylthio)-

Genetic inactivation of p110-δ reduces MM
growth and sensitizes cells to bortezomib
We determined the effect of shRNA knockdown of
individual PI3K isoforms on MM growth. RPMI8226 cells
were transfected using shRNA to specifically inactivate
the individual p110 isoforms. Knockdown of p110–δ most
significantly reduced the growth rate of RPMI8226 MM
cells (Figure 2A). The role of p110-δ has been studied
in vivo in a p110-δ null mouse and in a p110-δ kinasedead mouse (p110-δD910A/D910A) [23]. Phenotypic analyses,
in vitro and ex vivo studies determined that p110-δ is
the predominant PI3K isoform that regulates the B cell
phenotype. Moreover, using cells derived from p110-δ
kinase-dead mice, it was shown that 90% of the PI3K
kinase activity was dependent on p110-δ. Importantly,
knockdown of PIK3CD also preferentially sensitized MM
cells to proteasome inhibition (Figure 2B).

PI3K activity is increased in PCs from
MM patients relative to those from healthy
individuals or MGUS patients
The contribution of PI3K kinase activity in MM
remains poorly understood. To investigate the role
of PI3K, we directly measured PI3K kinase activity
in CD138+ cells that had been isolated from healthy
individuals, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown
significance (MGUS) or MM patients (Figure 1A).
MGUS is a pre-malignant condition that nearly uniformly
precedes the development of MM. PI3K kinase activity
was directly measured by quantitating production of
phosphatidylinositol [3, 4, 5]-trisphosphate (PIP3) using
a colorimetric ELISA assay. PI3K activity was greater in
PCs from MM patients compared to PCs from MGUS or
healthy individuals (Figure 1A).

compound that reduced myeloma viability, reduced PIP3
production and that also possessed favorable physicochemical properties (Figure 3D).

reduced PIP3 production in RPMI8226 cells, while
knockdown of p110-α reduced PIP3 production by ~20%.
Knockdown of p110-β and p110–γ had minimal effect on
PIP3 production. The results were consistent with prior
studies to indicated that the majority of PI3K activity in
plasma cells (PCs) is dependent upon p110-δ [22, 23].
The dose-dependent effect of DT97 on PIP3 production
by individual p110-isoforms was then determined
(Figure 4B). The results indicated that DT97 inhibited
the production of PIP3 most potently against the p110-δ
isoform and had weaker activity against p110-α and no
effect on p110-β or p110-γ. By comparison, idelalisib
(formerly CAL-101) predominantly inhibits the p110-δ
isoform but also reduces p110-γ activity (Table 1) [32].

DT97 inhibits p110-δ kinase activity
We next determined the effect of individual p110
isoforms on PI3K kinase activity in RPMI8226 cells.
Cells were transfected with isoform-specific shRNA
to individually knockdown p110 isoforms, cultured in
the presence of puromycin and PIP3 production then
measured in the transfected cells (Figure 4A). Results
indicated that the knockdown of p110-δ dramatically

DT97 did not significantly inhibit a number of other
kinases that have been targeted to treat human cancers
(Table 1).
To more rigorously define the on-target effect of
DT97 on MM cytotoxicity, we then demonstrated that
PIK3CD knockdown significantly reduced the effect of
DT97 on the viability of RPMI8226 cells (Figure 4C).
Treatment with DT97 had little effect on RPMI8226
cells after shRNA knockdown of PIK3CD. The in vitro
growth inhibitory effect of DT97 on RPMI8226 cells
was then determined and compared to that of idelalisib
(Figure 4D). DT97 reduced the viability of parental and
drug-resistant MM cells more potently than idelalisib. The
p110-δ isoform is critical for transformation in CLL and
activates the serine (Ser)–threonine (Thr) kinases AKT
and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However,
CXCR4, CD40 and CD49d, also play important roles in
this process. Idelalisib is a potent, p110-δ inhibitor that is

FDA-approved for the treatment of CLL. While idelalisib
more effectively reduced the viability of CLL cells, DT97
more potently reduced the viability of MM cells. DT97
treatment generated more apoptotic MM cells than CLL
cells while idelalisib had a more potent effect on CLL cells
that DT97 (Figure 4E).

DT97 overcomes bortezomib-resistance and
inhibits chemotaxis
Results indicated that co-treatment with DT97 and
either bortezomib or carfilzomib overcame resistance
to PIs (Figure 5A). Importantly, results indicated that
DT97 affected drug-resistant RPMI8226 cells but did
not induce apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) (Figure 5B). BMSCs induce the migration
and homing (chemotaxis) of MM cells to BM. To
investigate the effect of DT97 on chemotaxis, RPMI8226

Figure 3: High-throughput screening of chemical compounds to identify novel p110-δ inhibitors. (A) Target structures were
searched using 360,000 compounds in the drug discovery library and Accelrys Pipeline Pilot Software. Similarity searches were performed
through comparison of molecular fingerprints. The Accelrys Pipeline Pilot (version 8.0.1.600) was used to generate 18 connectivity, 2
pharmacophore and 1 MDLKeys fingerprints for each compound to serve as the basis for comparisons. The two pharmacophore fingerprints
were averaged due to strong redundancy, leaving a total of 21 fingerprint types for the analysis. These are circular fingerprints based on
substructure environments of a specific length (2, 4, or 6 atoms) centered about each atom of the molecule. Each atom of the molecule
generates such an integer string, with each integer representing an atom within x atoms of the initial point. The composite of these strings
is a matrix of character strings representing the entire molecule, i.e., the aggregate of the parts is the whole). Different fingerprints have
slightly different strengths and weaknesses, so the UC DDC executes each compound search as 21 parallel searches that are combined as
shown in the graphic below. (B) Viability of MM cells after treatment with either the 96 compounds identified in the virtual screen or with

cells were labeled using the CellTrace reagent CFSE
(5(6)-carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimidyl, a cell
permeant, pro-dye that permits the tracing single cell types
in mixed cell type populations. The CellTrace method
employs a bright, single-peak green fluorescent stain
that enables visualization of tumor cells co-cultured with
BMSCs. CFSE covalently binds intracellular proteins and
is well-retained in cells for several days, is non-toxic and
does not adversely affect growth. Intracellular esterases
in live cells then cleave CFSE-acetate to generate the
green fluorescent carboxy-fluorescein. MM cells were
placed in the upper chamber separated from BMSCs in
the lower chamber by a semi-permeable membrane.

DT97 treatment reduced the migration of MM cells into
the lower chambers with BMSCs (Figure 5C). We then
demonstrated that the culture media from BMSCs (BM
sup) also promoted the migration of MM cells and that
the effect of BM sup on migration was reduced by DT97
treatment (Figure 5D). In addition, treatment with DT97
did not significantly reduce the viability of BMSCs
(Figure 5E). Co-culture of MM cells with BMSCs
significantly increased the production of the cytokines Il-6
and CXCR12 but the induction was inhibited by DT97
treatment (Figure 5F, 5G). It appears that DT97 treatment
prevents MM migration, in part, through the reduction of
cytokine production.

two drugs added together by determining a combination
index (CI). By definition, CI = 1 reflects an additive
effect, CI < 1 reflects drug synergism and CI > 1 reflects
drug antagonism [24–26]. Co-treatment with DT97 and
bortezomib synergistically increased the number of
apoptotic cells. CI values for bortezomib at 3 nM and
DT97 added at 100, 200 or 300 nM were < 1 indicating
that the effect of this combination was synergistic. AKT
and ERK1/2 are downstream targets of PI3K. DT97
treatment reduced the phosphorylation of AKT at Ser308/
Thr473 and ERK1/2 at Thre202/Tyr-204 (Figure 7C).

The anticancer effect of DT97 was externally
validated using the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cells
(Figure 6). The anticancer efficacy of DT97 prioritized to
MM, leukemia and lymphoma cancer cell lines (Table 2).
The most potent effect was seen in the MM cell line
RPMI8226 (IC50 ~450 nM).

CFSE-labeled MM cells were grown in culture with
BMSCs and the number of CFSE-positive cells counted
at 72 h. The number of RPMI8226 cells was greater in the
fraction grown with BMSCs than those grown cells alone
(Figure 8A). MM cells grown with BMSCs were also
less sensitive to bortezomib than those MM cells cultured
alone (Figure 8B). RPMI8226 cells grown with BMSCs
were treated with bortezomib, DT97 or both as indicated
(Figure 8C). Importantly, CFSE-labeled MM cells grown

together with BMSCs were more sensitive to co-treatment
with both agents than with either agent alone.

bortezomib and DT97. Treatment with bortezomib alone
or bortezomib with DT97 dramatically reduced tumor
growth (Figure 9A). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
indicated that treatment with bortezomib and DT97 also
improved overall survival (OS) relative those mice treated
with vehicle, DT97 or bortezomib alone (Figure 9B).
OS for untreated mice was 14 days, DT97 treatment
alone was 16 days, bortezomib alone was 20 days and
DT97+bortezomib was 23 days (p < 0.05).
Publically available datasets were analyzed to
compare expression of the different p110 isoforms in
MGUS, Smoldering MM (SMM) and MM versus healthy
PCs (Figure 10). Dataset GDS4968 compared expression
of p110 isoforms from PCs of healthy individuals, MGUS,
SMM and MM patients [27]. Importantly, the expression
of PIK3CA, PIK3CB and PIK3CG was actually lower
in PCs from MM patients than in healthy PCs. The

only PIK3C isoform expressed at greater levels in PCs
from MM patients compared to healthy individuals
was PIK3CD. These findings support the importance of
targeting the p110-δ isoform in MM. In addition, dataset
GDS2643 was analyzed to compare PIK3CD expression
in B lymphocytes and PCs from healthy, Waldenstrom’s
Macroglobulinemia (WM), CLL and MM patients [28]
(Figure 11A). Again, PIK3CD expression was greater in
PCs from MM patients than from healthy individuals.
PIK3CD expression was also greater in B lymphocytes
and PCs isolated from WM patients than from healthy
individuals. Moreover, we found that the mean expression
of PIK3CD was actually lower in B lymphocytes from
CLL patients than in B lymphocytes isolated from healthy
individuals. Analysis of dataset GDS4167 also supported
the finding that PIK3CD expression was greater in healthy
B cells than those from CLL patients [29] (Figure 11B).

The anti-tumor screening was performed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Developmental Therapeutics Program
(DTP), Bethesda, Maryland. Compounds were subjected to the NCI’s in vitro disease-oriented human cells screening panel
assay. 60 cell lines of nine tumor subpanels were incubated with five concentrations (0.01–100 mM) of DT97 to create log
concentration vs % growth inhibition curves. Three response parameters, median growth inhibition (GI50), total growth
inhibition (TGI) and median lethal concentration (LC50), were calculated for each cell line. The GI50 value corresponds
to the compound’s concentration causing 50% decrease in net cell growth, the TGI value is the compound’s concentration
resulting in total growth inhibition and the LC50 value is the compound’s concentration causing a net 50% loss of initial
cells at the end of the incubation period.

DISCUSSION

is the Ser/Thr protein kinase AKT, which is activated by
phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473. DT97 treatment
of MM cells reduced AKT phosphorylation at both sites.
Previously, AKT phosphorylation was shown to be a major
determinant of bortezomib sensitivity [33]. In related
studies, bortezomib treatment downregulated phosphoAKT levels in drug sensitive hepatocellular carcinoma
cells (HCC) but no alterations of phospho-AKT were
observed in drug resistant HCC cells. We speculate that
DT97 reduces AKT phosphorylation to overcome drug
resistance. Future studies will further investigate the role
of DT97 in AKT signaling in MM tumor cells.
Related studies also indicate that treatment of
hematologic cancer cells with proteasome inhibitors
activates Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) [34]. Bortezomib
co-treatment with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in drugresistant lymphoma also led to AKT inactivation [35]. The
BM microenvironment has also been proposed to promote
drug resistance and DT97 treatment effectively reduced MM
growth and enhanced the anti-myeloma effect of bortezomib
in presence of BMSCs [36]. In summary, we identified a
novel small molecule that inhibits p110-δ activity to reduce
MM growth and that holds promise for lead compound
optimization, pharmacokinetic studies and early phase
clinical trials. Combination of DT97 with existing therapies
is a rational strategy to improve MM treatment.

Despite
the
introduction
of
PIs
and
immunomodulatory agents into the clinic, MM remains
incurable. While most patients initially respond to PIs,
drug resistance emerges and represents the primary factor
for treatment failure. Despite the availability of numerous
salvage regimens, once drug resistance has emerged,
median survival is less than one year. Only ~25% of
MM patients respond to bortezomib or carfilzomib
when administered as monotherapy, leaving substantial
room for improvement. Each PI3K isoform fulfill a
unique role in cancer and has prompted development
of isoform-selective inhibitors. The lack of efficacy of
idelalisib in MM, as well as in acute myeloid leukemia
and myeloproliferative neoplasms, is attributed to a
highly variable p110-δ active site and a high degree of
conformational flexibility that leads to poor inhibitor
binding. Structures of p110-δ in complex with a broad
panel of isoform- and pan-selective PI3K inhibitors
revealed that selectivity toward p110-δ can be achieved
by exploiting the sequence diversity and conformational
flexibility of the p110-δ active site [11, 30–32].
We used these observations to rationalize the design of a
selective p110-δ inhibitor with greatly improved potencies
to treat MM. An important downstream effector of PI3K

MATERIALS AND METHODS

PIK3C isoform knockdown
shRNA in pLKO.1-TCR lentiviral cloning
vectors were transfected into 293T packaging cells with
packaging and envelope vector using lipofectamine
2000 (Thermo-Fisher). Viral supernatants were used to
transduce myeloma cells. After 48 h, virus was collected
and RPMI8226 cells transduced with vectors expressing
scrambled (control) or p110-specific shRNA. Cells were
mixed with virus and polybrene (8 µg/mL), centrifuged
at 2000 × rpm for 90 min, incubated overnight, media
changed and selected in puromycin.

Myeloma cell lines and patient tumor cells
MM cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were
cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with fetal calf serum (Hyclone), penicillin-streptomycin,
L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate and β-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma-Aldrich,
St.
Louis,
MO).
AMCL1,
AMCL2, leukemic, lymphoma and Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia cell lines were cultured as described
[37, 38]. Bortezomib and carfilzomib were from Selleck
Chemicals (Houston, TX). Human bone marrow stromal
cell line HS-5 (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM. Patient
bone marrow aspirates were obtained after Institutional
Review Board approval or from ConversantBio
(Huntsville, AL) and CD138+ cells then isolated by
microbead selection (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA).
Cells were cultured at 37°C in humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.

Quantitation of PI3K activity
To directly assess PI3K activity, PI3K was isolated
by immunoprecipitation using an antibody to the p85
adapter subunit and the ability of the co-precipitated
catalytic p110 subunit to convert PIP2 to PIP3 in a
kinase reaction assessed by measuring the amount of
PIP3 generated using a competitive ELISA [40, 41].
1 × 106 cells were washed thrice with 137 mM NaCl,
20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,
0.1 mM Na orthovanadate (Sigma) (buffer A) and
lysed in 1 mL of the same supplemented with 1 mM
phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma) and 1%
nonyl phenoxylpolyethoxylethanol (NP40) (Calbiochem,
Darmstadt, Germany) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were
centrifuged at 13,000 × rpm for 10 min and supernatants
stored at −80°C. Frozen lysates were thawed and PI3K
immunoprecipitated with 5 μl anti-PI3K p85 (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for 1 h at 4°C,
followed by the addition of 60 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein
A agarose beads for 1 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitate
was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × rpm for 10 sec,
washed 3 times in buffer A + 1% NP40, thrice with 0.1 M
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM LiCl, 0.1 mM Na orthovanadate
and twice with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1 mM
Na orthovanadate. Pellets resuspended in 110 μl of the
kinase reaction buffer containing 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.0, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 25 μM ATP. Reactions were incubated for 3 h at
37°C with 40 pmol PIP2 (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake
City, UT). Reactions were stopped with EDTA (5 mM)
and centrifuged at 13,000 × rpm at 4°C. Supernatants
were transferred to a microtitre plate for a competitive
ELISA (Echelon Biosciences) to quantify PIP3 generated.
Triplicate reactions were incubated with anti-PIP3
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Reactions were then
transferred to plates coated with PIP3 and incubated for 1 h.
After 3 washes with TBS + 0.05% Tween20 (TBST), 100 μl
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody to
the anti-PIP3 was added and incubation continued for
1 h in the dark. Following 3 washes with TBST, 100 μl

XTT viability assay
Cells were plated, treated as indicated for 72 h
and 2, 3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) added (Sigma-Aldrich) after
activation with N-methyl dibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate
(Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance was measured and the effect
on myeloma viability determined as previously described
[37–39]. Assays were performed in triplicate and the mean
and standard deviation determined. Relative cell viability
(mean ± SD) was calculated compared to readings from
untreated cells.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were treated as indicated and incubated for
18 h at 37°C. Cells were collected, centrifuged at 200 × g
for 5 min, supernatant discarded and the pellet was washed
with 1× buffer. Cells were then resuspended in 90 µl
of 1 × buffer and 10 µl of FITC-conjugated annexin V
(Molecular Probes®, Grand Island, NY), incubated in the
dark and analyzed using a Coulter® epics® XL-MCL.

Generation of PI-resistant cell lines
RPMI8226 cells were grown under standard
conditions and exposed to successively increased
concentrations of the PIs bortezomib, carfilzomib or
ixazomib over 6 months to generate PI-resistant cells. As
controls, parental cells were exposed to DMSO vehicle
under the same algorithm as resistant cells.

of tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate was added
and reactions were stopped after 20 min with 100 μl
0.5 M H2SO4. Absorbance was measured (450 nm) and
PIP3 quantified using a standard curve generated with
experimental samples and plotted on a log scale.

To evaluate the anti-myeloma effect of DT97
in vivo, 5–6 week old female athymic NCr (nu/nu)
mice (Charles River, Frederick, MD) were injected
subcutaneously with 2 × 106 KMS28BM cells in serumfree medium. After tumors were detected (> 50 mm3),
mice were randomized to 4 groups (7/group). Mice
received intravenous injection of either vehicle (PBS in
10% DMSO); bortezomib (0.5 mg/kg), DT97 (10 mg/kg)
or both bortezomib and DT97. Tumor volume (TV)
measurements were made using a vernier caliper and
calculated using the formula: TV = 0.5 (a × b2) where a
is the long diameter and b the short diameter. Mice were
euthanized when tumors reached 2 cm3, became ulcerated
or elicited neurologic or musculoskeletal complications
that limited mobility and feeding.

Drug synergy
The Compusyn software and program was used to
determine the effect of drug combinations and general
dose-effects and is based on the median-effect principle
and the Chou-Talalay Combination Index-Isobologram
Theorem (24–26). The Chou-Talalay method for drug
combination is based on the median-effect equation,
derived from the mass-action law principle, which
provides the common link between single entity and
multiple entities, and first order and higher order dynamics.
This general equation encompasses the Michaelis-Menten,
Hill, Henderson-Hasselbalch, and Scatchard equations.
The resulting combination index (CI) theorem of ChouTalalay offers quantitative definition for additive effect
(CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI > 1) in
drug combinations.
