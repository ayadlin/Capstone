Abstract
TRPM7 encodes a Ca2þ-permeable nonselective cation channel with kinase activity. TRPM7 has been
implicated in control of cell adhesion and migration, but whether TRPM7 activity contributes to cancer
progression has not been established. Here we report that high levels of TRPM7 expression independently
predict poor outcome in breast cancer patients and that it is functionally required for metastasis formation in a
mouse xenograft model of human breast cancer. Mechanistic investigation revealed that TRPM7 regulated
myosin II–based cellular tension, thereby modifying focal adhesion number, cell–cell adhesion and polarized cell
movement. Our ﬁndings therefore suggest that TRPM7 is part of a mechanosensory complex adopted by cancer
cells to drive metastasis formation. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4250–61. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Metastasis formation is a complicated multistep process
involving tumor cell dissemination from the primary tumor,
matrix invasion, entry into the circulatory system, extravasation through capillary endothelium, and, ﬁnally, the outgrowth of secondary tumors in distant organs. Each of these
events requires extensive and continuous Ca2þ-dependent
remodeling of the actomyosin cytoskeleton as well as close
interactions with the surroundings of a cell, mediated by
dynamic adhesive structures, such as focal adhesions and
adherens junctions. These specialized cell adhesion sites
convey mechanical cues across the plasma membrane,
affecting both the physical properties of their surroundings
as well as intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics. As the formation and maturation of focal adhesions and adherens
junctions is dependent on the applied mechanical forces,
these structures are considered to function as mechanosen-

sors that integrate mechanical cues from inside and outside
the cell (1–5). The complex protein–protein interactions
within these adhesion sites signiﬁcantly contribute to tumor
progression and metastasis formation. Hence, proteins that
regulate adhesion formation or turnover represent interesting therapeutic targets to limit the metastatic potential of
cancer cells (6).
Members of the mammalian transient receptor potential
(TRP) cation channel family are considered key players in
mechanosensory signaling (7–11). TRP channels organize into
large macromolecular complexes linked to the actomyosin
cytoskeleton, which may serve to localize signal transduction
pathways and/or enhance the rate of signal transmission
(7, 12, 13). Tethered to the cytoskeleton, their ion conducting
properties can be modulated by different stimuli, including
mechanical cues, resulting in a variety of cellular responses. In
earlier work, we and others identiﬁed TRPM7, a Ca2þ-permeable nonselective cation channel with kinase activity, as a
regulator of actomyosin contractility, cell adhesion, and directed cell migration (14–16). However, a role for this bifunctional
channel in cancer progression has not been examined. Here we
show that high TRPM7 expression, at the time of diagnosis,
predicts poor therapy outcome in a large cohort of breast
cancer patients. Moreover, TRPM7 is a critical determinant of
breast cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis formation
in vivo.

TRPM7 Drives Breast Cancer Metastasis

TRPM7 expression measurements in patient samples
Our discovery cohort consisted of 368 early-stage breast
cancer samples, described in a previous study (17). The
validation cohort consisted of 144 patients with unilateral
breast cancer who had undergone resection of their primary tumor between November 1987 and December 1997
(18). TRPM7 expression levels in tumor samples derived
from the discovery cohort were determined by microarray
analysis using Affymetrix U133B Genechips (Affymetrix).
Raw data are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus
repository database (GEO accession number: GSE6532).
TRPM7 expression levels in the validation cohort were
determined by quantitative PCR reactions on cDNA samples derived from primary tumors, using power SYBR-green
reagent (Applied Biosystems) in combination with TRPM7speciﬁc primers (forward: TAGCCTTTAGCCACTGGAC;
reverse: GCATCTTCTCCTAGATTTGC) according to manufacturer's recommendations. TRPM7 gene expression
levels were normalized to the HPRT housekeeping gene
(forward: GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT; reverse: TGACACTGGCAAAACAATGCA) and calculated according to
the cycling threshold method (19). Statistical analyses were
carried out using SPSS software (version 16.0; SPSS). Discovery and validation cohorts were dichotomized using
median TRPM7 expression as cut-off. Survival curves were
visualized by Kaplan–Meier plots, using recurrence-free
and distant metastasis-free survival as endpoints and compared using log-rank tests. HRs were estimated by univariate Cox regression analysis. The independent prognostic
value of TRPM7 was assessed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis on combined discovery and
validation cohorts.
Generation and validation of cell lines
Human TRPM7 short hairpin RNAs (shRNA; #1: 5GCGCTTTCCTTATCCACTTAA-3; #2: 5-CAGCAGAGCCCGATATTATTT-3) were introduced in MDA-MB-231 [HTB-26,
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] and human
TRPM7 shRNA#1 was introduced in MCF7 human breast
cancer cells (HTB-22, ATCC), using the pLKO lentiviral
expression vector according to manufacturer's instructions
(Sigma Aldrich). A nonfunctional shRNA (5-GCTACAAGAGAAACCAAATCT-3) was used as negative control. Transduced cells were selected with 1 mg/mL puromycin. For
bioluminescent imaging, control and TRPM7 knockdown
MDA-MB-231 cells were cotransduced with a retroviral
pLZRS luciferase reporter construct and selected with
0.5 mg/mL Zeocin. For rescue of TRPM7 expression levels,
HA-tagged mouse TRPM7, containing one mismatch with
respect to the human-speciﬁc shRNA (14), was introduced in
MDA-MB-231 TRPM7 shRNA cells. Transduced cells were
selected with 1 mg/mL G418. TRPM7 mRNA expression
levels were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase
PCR with the additional use of mouse-speciﬁc TRPM7
primers (forward: TAGCCTTTAGCCACTGGACC; reverse:
GCATCTTCTCCTAGATTGGCAG). TRPM7 protein levels
were determined by radioactively labeling the TRPM7 kinase
domain as described previously (14).

Cell viability and proliferation measurements
The effect of TRPM7 knockdown on cell viability and proliferation was assessed by MTS assays according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Cell-cycle distribution of the
different cell lines was determined by ﬂuorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analysis on cells stained with propidium
iodide. Cells were harvested and the cell pellet was incubated
in staining solution (1 mg/mL sodium citrate, 0.1 mg/mL
RNAseA, 20 mg/mL propidium iodide, and 0.1% Triton X-100).
Cells were washed and subjected to FACS analysis. Cell-cycle
distribution was quantiﬁed using FlowJo analysis software.
Mouse xenograft experiments
All animal work was carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Welfare Committee (DEC-NKI10.034). Immunodeﬁcient Rag2/IL2rg/ mice were used for
metastasis experiments. MDA-MB-231-Luc control and
TRPM7 knockdown cells were collected and washed with PBS.
Subsequently, 0.2 mL PBS containing 5  105 cells was injected
into a tail vein. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging from day 7 onwards. Beetle luciferin (Promega)
was dissolved at 15 mg/mL in PBS and stored at 20 C.
Animals were anaesthetized with 2% to 3% isoﬂurane. Luciferin solution was injected intraperitonially (0.01 mL/g body
weight). Light emission was measured 15 minutes later, using a
cooled CCD camera (IVIS; Xenogen), coupled to Living Image
acquisition and analysis software over an integration time of 1
minute. Signal intensity was expressed as ﬂux (photons/sec)
integrated over the lung region. Lung tissue was collected at
day 30 after injection. Tissues were ﬁxed in EAF (ethanol–
acetic acid–formol saline ﬁxative, 40:5:10:45% v/v) and processed for histology. Parafﬁn sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. All microscopic images were acquired
using IP-Lab software (Scanalytics Inc.) in combination with a
monochrome CCD camera (Retiga SRV, 1,392  1,040 pixels)
and a RGB ﬁlter (Slikder Module; QImaging) attached to a
motorized microscope (Leica DM6000). Quantiﬁcation of
tumor size and number was carried out by ImageJ image
analysis software.
Cell migration, elongation, and scatter experiments
Following overnight serum starvation, cells were harvested
and resuspended in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM) containing 0.1% FBS. Subsequently, 50,000 cells were
applied to a transwell insert with 8-mm pore size (Corning Life
Sciences), which was incubated in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS. Cells were allowed to migrate for 8 hours at 37 C.
Migrated cells were ﬁxed (75% methanol and 25% acetic acid)
and stained (0.25% Coomassie blue, 45% methanol, and 10%
acetic acid in H2O). Single cell migration on vitronectin-coated
(500 ng/mL) culture dishes was followed for 24 hours by timelapse microscopy and analyzed using ImageJ image analysis
software. Cell elongation was determined based on length and
width ratios, measured after 24 hours. A cell was considered
elongated when the ratio length/width was larger than 2. MCF7
cell scattering on vitronectin-coated (500 ng/mL) culture
dishes was visualized by time-lapse microscopy in DMEM
supplemented with 0.1% FBS. Gap closure assays were carried

out according to manufacturer's recommendations (Applied
Biophysics). In short, 40,000 MCF7 cells were seeded per insert
and cultured overnight. After removal of the insert, cells were
allowed to migrate for 24 hours, and migration was followed by
time-lapse microscopy. Where indicated, cells were incubated
in the presence of different concentrations Y27632 (SigmaAldrich) and GSK429286 (Seleckbio) Rho-kinase inhibitors.
Fluorescent staining of focal adhesions, E-cadherin, and
F-actin
Images were taken with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal (Leica
Microsystems) equipped with a 63 water-immersion objective and LAS-AF acquisition software (Leica Microsystems).
Cells were cultured overnight on vitronectin-coated (500
ng/mL) glass coverslips in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS.
Where indicated, cells were next incubated for 2 hours in
the presence of 5 mmol/L Y27632 Rho-kinase inhibitor
(Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were ﬁxed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained for pTyr118
paxillin (1:100; Life Technologies), E-cadherin (1:200; BD
Biosciences) and F-actin, using Alexa-568–conjugated Phalloidin (1:100; Life Technologies). The average number of focal
adhesions per cell was quantiﬁed using an ImageJ analysis
routine (macro). Series of paxillin images (pixel size, 0.11 
0.11 mm2) were normalized with respect to intensity/contrast, background was subtracted and cell boundaries were
detected by manually setting the appropriate threshold. The
original image was subjected to a rolling ball ﬁlter of radius
10 pixels, which effectively suppresses staining irregularities
while retaining contrast in the focal adhesions. Further
thresholding and the "Analyze Particles" plugin (settings:
particle size 30–500 pixels; circularity 0.1–1.0) were used to
determine the number of focal adhesions. Photomicrographs
of at least 60 cells were analyzed for each condition.
Detection of pSer19 myosin light chain and focal
adhesion–associated pTyr118 paxillin on Western blot
For detection of pSer19 myosin light chain in control and
TRPM7 shRNA–transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, cells were
lysed in Laemmli buffer supplemented with 1 mmol/L MgCl2
and 1:200 Benzoase Nuclease (Merck) and left on ice for 30
minutes. Focal adhesion–associated proteins were extracted
from MDA-MB-231 cells, as described previously (20). Proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane. Blots were incubated with rabbit
polyclonal anti-pTyr118 paxillin antibody (1:750; Life Technologies) or anti-pSer19 myosin light chain antibody (1:1,000; Life
Technologies) and mouse monoclonal g-tubulin (1:10,000;
Sigma Aldrich) antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000; Dako). Proteins were detected using ECL Western blot reagent (GE
Healthcare) and exposing the blots to ﬁlm.
Statistical analysis
Statistical data are expressed as mean  SD or  SEM, as
indicated in the text. Statistical differences were tested with 2sided, unpaired Student t tests, and P less than 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results and Discussion
TRPM7 mRNA expression levels in primary tumors are
associated with breast cancer progression and
metastasis formation, independent from standard
clinical parameters
Immunohistochemistry on primary breast cancer tissue
samples showed that TRPM7 protein is expressed by epithelial
cells that align mammary glands and by breast tumor cells.
Perinuclear staining of breast carcinoma cells was observed
with accentuation of the nuclear membrane, with or without
diffuse staining of the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). We explored the
prognostic value of TRPM7 mRNA levels in breast cancer,
using microarray-based gene expression data from breast cancer specimens, obtained by resection of the primary tumor at
diagnosis (discovery cohort; n ¼ 368) (Supplementary Table S1;
ref. 17). After dichotomization based on the median TRPM7
expression level, the TRPM7-high group (n ¼ 184) was found
to exhibit a signiﬁcantly shorter recurrence-free survival as
compared with the TRPM7-low group (n ¼ 184; HR, 1.42; 95%
CI, 1.01–2.01, P ¼ 0.042; Fig. 1B). Even stronger was the
association of TRPM7 with distant metastasis-free survival
interval (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.22–2.81, P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 1B).
In 3 additional breast cancer cohorts (n ¼ 190, 244, and
n ¼ 216), we did not detect a signiﬁcant association of
TRPM7 with disease outcome. Discordances between microarray-based datasets remain a serious problem, often reﬂecting
differences in patient populations, probe selection, and mRNA
abundance. We therefore sought for independent validation
by carrying out quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments in a highly similar, independent breast cancer patient
cohort (validation cohort; n ¼ 144; Supplementary Table S1).
TRPM7 mRNA expression was associated with disease recurrence (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.06–3.33, P ¼ 0.029) and occurrence
of distant metastases. Although the HR was similar as in the
discovery cohort, the latter association did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 0.91–3.71, P ¼ 0.085), possibly
because of a lower number of events (Fig. 1C).
We next assessed the association between TRPM7 expression and standard clinical parameters using the combined
discovery and validation cohorts (n ¼ 512). In support of its
association with disease progression, TRPM7 was found
enriched in high-grade primary tumors (P ¼ 0.02; Supplementary Table S2A). Other prognostic parameters, including tumor
size and ER status, were not associated with TRPM7 expression
levels and TRPM7 expression was similar between breast
cancer subtypes (P ¼ 0.28; Supplementary Table S2B and C).
However, because the dominant prognostic feature in all
microarray studies of ER-positive breast cancer is proliferation,
we cannot exclude that TRPM7 is an indirect indicator of
proliferation in the ER-positive subgroup of tumors.
Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that histologic
grade, tumor size, and TRPM7 expression levels are strong
predictors of both disease recurrence and the occurrence of
distant metastases (Table 1; P < 0.01). Importantly, multivariate analysis revealed that TRPM7 mRNA expression is
an independent prognostic marker for both disease recurrence
(P ¼ 0.02) and occurrence of metastases at distant sites
(P ¼ 0.01; Table 1), after correction for standard clinical

indicated a strong and independent association between
TRPM7 expression levels and breast cancer progression.
TRPM7 knockdown interferes with the metastatic
potential, but not proliferation, of invasive, triplenegative breast cancer cells in vivo
To establish a causal relation between TRPM7 expression
levels and metastasis formation, shRNA-mediated knockdown
was carried out by lentiviral transduction of invasive, triplenegative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Knockdown efﬁciency was about 80%, as determined both by qPCR and by

measuring TRPM7 autophosphorylation using an in vitro
kinase assay (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). A number of
studies has shown that TRPM7 knockdown can affect cell
viability and proliferation in vitro (21, 22). However, we
observed that MDA-MB-231 TRPM7 shRNA cells proliferated
normally and showed no loss in cell viability (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S2A). We next compared in vivo metastasis
formation of MDA-MB-231 control and TRPM7 shRNA cells
that were made to express a luciferase reporter gene. Following
injection of cells in the tail vein of immunodeﬁcient Rag2/
IL2rg/ mice, luciferase-based noninvasive bioluminescence
imaging was used to monitor dissemination and growth of
tumor cells in vivo. Consistent with earlier reports describing

this experimental metastasis model (23), tumor cells were
initially trapped in the lungs, probably because of size restrictions of the mouse lung capillaries (Fig. 2B). The progressive
increase of the bioluminescent signal in mice injected with
control cells indicates that these cells effectively developed into
pulmonary metastases (Fig. 2C). At day 30 after injection,
metastatic spread of tumor cells throughout the body was
observed in all of the control mice. One mouse had to be taken
out of the experiment 22 days after injection because of a large
tumor mass in the head of the animal (Fig. 2D). TRPM7
knockdown led to a strong reduction in bioluminescent signal
intensity from day 7 onwards, which remained mostly restricted to the lungs (Fig. 2C and D). Similar results were obtained
from an independent experiment in which an additional
TRPM7 knockdown cell line, derived using a second shRNA,
was included (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B and Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). These observations suggested that TRPM7
knockdown impairs the initial establishment of tumors in the
lung and dissemination to other parts of the body. Quantitative
analysis of tumor size in HE-stained lung sections conﬁrmed
that TRPM7 knockdown did not affect proliferation [mean
tumor size, control: 0.045 mm2  0.0047 (n ¼ 474) vs. TRPM7

0.29; Fig 2E and G and Supplementary Fig. S2D]. However,
TRPM7 knockdown signiﬁcantly reduced the number of lung
tumors per mouse (control: 158.33  11.7 vs. TRPM7 shRNA:
43.67  5.33, 3 mice per group, P < 0.001; Fig. 2F and G). Overall,
these experiments showed that a reduction of TRPM7 protein

expression effectively interferes with the metastatic potential
of invasive human breast cancer cells in vivo.
TRPM7 knockdown impairs migratory properties of
invasive, triple-negative breast cancer cells in vitro
To examine how TRPM7 may affect the ability of tumor cells
to spread to distant sites, we studied the consequences of
TRPM7 knockdown on cytoskeletal organization and cell
behavior. Whereas control MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a
characteristic spindle-shaped (mesenchymal) morphology
with actin-rich protrusions at the leading edge, this elongated
morphology was lost upon TRPM7 knockdown (percentage
elongated control cells: 63.3%  2.8% vs. TRPM7 shRNA: 30.0%
 2.5%, n > 400, 4 independent experiments, P < 0.001; Fig. 3A
and B). Moreover, loss of TRPM7 expression effectively interfered with the ability of these cells to migrate toward a serum
gradient, as determined in a transwell migration assay (control:
100% vs. TRPM7 shRNA: 50.56%  9.15%, 5 exp, P < 0.01;
Fig. 3C). By time-lapse microscopy, we observed that TRPM7
knockdown affected cell migration speed, resulting in significantly shorter migration trajectories (control: 29.7  2.2 mm/h
vs. TRPM7 shRNA: 17.2  1.1 mm/h, n > 200, 4 exp, P < 0.01;
Fig. 3D and E).
Similar results were obtained with the second TRPM7
knockdown cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B, Supplementary Fig. S3). We additionally reexpressed a mouse
TRPM7 cDNA into the TRPM7 knockdown cells, which
contained one mismatch with respect to the (human

In addition to the functional changes, immunoﬂuorescent

the number of focal adhesions, especially in the periphery of
TRPM7 knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells, relative to mocktransduced control cells (control: 13.8  0.62, TRPM7

adhesions are mechanosensitive adhesion structures whose
assembly and disassembly need to be tightly regulated by a
combination of myosin II–based cellular tension and local
Ca2þ signaling events to allow optimal cell migration (24–
29). Increased focal adhesion assembly is generally associated with high cytoskeletal tension, accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion components such as
paxillin as well as increased myosin light chain (MLC)
phosphorylation (24). Indeed, the increase in focal adhesions
observed in the TRPM7 knockdown cells was reﬂected by a
rise in Tyr118-phosphorylated paxillin and Ser19-phosphorylated MLC on a Western blot (Fig. 4C and Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Reexpression of TRPM7 reduced focal adhesion
content (18.2  0.89, n ¼ 45, P < 0.001) and reverted paxillin
phosphorylation (Fig. 4).

ER-positive breast cancer cells exhibit reduced cell
migration speed and enforced cell–cell adhesions upon
TRPM7 knockdown
In addition to basal-like tumors, represented by the triplenegative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer model, a large part of
the patient dataset consisted of ER-positive, luminal type
breast cancer patients. To validate our observations in these
tumors, we knocked down TRPM7 in noninvasive, ER-positive MCF7 human breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.
S1E). This signiﬁcantly reduced migration of MCF7 cells in
gap-closure assays (control: 11.5  0.5% vs. TRPM7 shRNA:

www.aacrjournals.org

21.2  1.7% gap remaining after 24 hours, 3 exp, P < 0.01; Fig.
5A and B). In these epithelial-like cells, TRPM7 knockdown
predominantly affected cell–cell adhesion rather than cellsubstrate adhesion. Unlike the control shRNA-transduced
cells, the TRPM7 knockdown cells were able to maintain
cell–cell contacts upon serum deprivation, a condition
known to induce scattering of epithelial cells (ref. 30; Fig.
5C). Although increased MLC and paxillin phosphorylation
were not observed in MCF7 TRPM7 shRNA cells (data not
shown), confocal microscopy revealed profound effects on
cytoskeletal organization and cell–cell contacts (Fig. 5D).

Similar to our observations in MDA-MB-231 cells, TRPM7
knockdown induced the redistribution of ﬁlamentous actin
to the cell cortex. Moreover, cell–cell interactions seemed to
be enforced in MCF7 TRPM7 shRNA cells, evident from
increased cell–cell contact area and enrichment of E-cadherin at these interfaces. Cadherin-containing cell–cell
adhesions, known as adherens junctions, show functional
and structural similarities to focal adhesions (4). Like focal
adhesions, adherens junctions are highly dynamic multiprotein complexes that act in close association with the
actomyosin cytoskeleton to translate mechanical signals
into cellular responses. Moreover, their formation and
size are directly associated with myosin II–based cellular
tension (5).

Pharmacologic inhibition of cytoskeletal tension rescues
the TRPM7 knockdown phenotype
Our results indicated that TRPM7 knockdown confers a
contractile phenotype onto breast cancer cells and consequently, impairs their migratory and metastatic properties.
Consistent with this notion, inhibition of myosin II–based
cytoskeletal tension using the Y27632 Rho-kinase inhibitor
(31) was sufﬁcient to revert the phenotype of TRPM7 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells to the characteristic elongated
morphology of control cells (elongated cells: 54.5%  3.0%,
n > 100, 2 exp, P < 0.05; Fig. 6A), while reducing MLC- and
paxillin phosphorylation, and the number of focal adhesions

already signiﬁcantly increased gap-closure speed of MCF7
control cells. However, much higher concentrations of these
compounds were required to maximize gap-closure speed of
MCF7 TRPM7 shRNA cells, supporting the notion that
TRPM7 knockdown increases cellular tension.
Although our observations are not in agreement with the
general notion that increases in Rho-ROCK signaling positively
correlate with cell migration and metastasis formation
(6, 33, 34), it is well known that actomyosin contractility,

adhesion dynamics, and the mechanical properties of the
substrate have to be tightly balanced to maximize migration
velocity (26, 27, 35, 36). Hence, overassembly of either focal
adhesions or adherens junctions in the TRPM7 knockdown
cells, both a consequence of increased cytoskeletal tension,
likely interferes with optimal cell migration (Supplementary
Fig. S4E). Altogether, our results indicated that TRPM7 is part
of the mechanosensory machinery that regulates cellular tension and steers adhesion dynamics to allow cell migration and
metastasis formation.

Conclusions
TRP channels play a prominent role in translating mechanical forces into biochemical signals, although in most cases it
remains to be established whether they are directly activated
by mechanical stimulation. Activation of these proteins not
only leads to changes in local Ca2þ concentrations but also
triggers other signaling mechanisms that inﬂuence cell behavior and differentiation (37). Mice deﬁcient in TRPM7 show
widespread defects in early embryonic development, pointing
at a nonredundant role for this channel kinase in organ
development (38). Defects in mechanotransduction, especially
those that affect cellular tension, are known to contribute to
disease progression (39, 40). Hence, we propose that TRPM7guided cell adhesion and migration are normal attributes of
epithelial and mesenchymal cells, required during organ development, but when spuriously activated in cancer cells contribute to metastasis formation.
