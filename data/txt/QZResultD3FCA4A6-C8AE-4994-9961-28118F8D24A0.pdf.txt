Abstract
Three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities to assess responses to anticancer therapies are needed to minimize sampling
errors common to two-dimensional approaches as a result of
spatial heterogeneity in tumors. Recently, the feasibility and
reproducibility of 3D ultrasound molecular imaging (3D USMI)
using contrast agents, which target molecular markers, have greatly
improved, due to the development of clinical 3D matrix array
transducers. Here we report preclinical proof-of-concept studies
showing that 3D USMI of VEGFR2/KDR expression accurately
gauges longitudinal treatment responses to antiangiogenesis therapy in responding versus nonresponding mouse models of colon

cancer. Tumors in these models exhibited differential patterns of
VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI signals during the course of antiangiogenic treatment with bevacizumab. In responding tumors, the
VEGFR2 signal decreased as soon as 24 hours after therapy was
started, whereas in nonresponding tumors there was no change in
signal at any time point. The early decrease in VEGFR2 signal was
highly predictive of treatment outcome at the end of therapy.
Our results offer preclinical proof that 3D USMI can predict
responses to antiangiogenic therapy, warranting further investigation of its clinical translatability to predicting treatment outcomes
in patients. Cancer Res; 76(14); 4081–9. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

angiogenic drug approved by the FDA in the United States in
patients with metastasized colorectal cancer (5). Although multicenter randomized controlled trials showed that the addition of
bevacizumab to chemotherapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer, the overall tumor response rate was only 44.8% (6).
Inherent or acquired resistance is one of the major challenges
associated with antiangiogenic therapy (7). Therefore, there is a
critical need for developing and validating predictive biomarkers
for earlier identiﬁcation of responders from nonresponders to
minimize unnecessary treatments and associated adverse effects
and to allow earlier transition to next-line therapy. However,
traditional endpoints based on anatomical oncologic imaging has
been shown to be insufﬁcient for the evaluation of antiangiogenic
treatments (8).
Molecular imaging allows visualization and quantiﬁcation of
speciﬁc molecular markers expressed in diseased tissues, thereby
facilitating earlier evaluation of treatment response before overt
anatomic changes occur. Ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI)
using contrast microbubbles targeted at molecular markers
expressed on the tumor neovasculature is emerging as a promising
tool to assess expression levels of angiogenic markers such as
VEGFR2 for earlier cancer detection (9–12) and monitoring
antiangiogenic therapy (13, 14). USMI combines the advantages
of ultrasound such as relatively low cost, wide availability and
portability, and lack of ionizing radiation with those of molecular
imaging to allow quantitative monitoring of disease processes at
the molecular level. Recent studies have highlighted the need for
three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities of USMI, which is
critically needed for longitudinal monitoring of treatment
response in cancer due to the known spatial heterogeneity of

Tumor angiogenesis, the spouting of neoangiogenic vessels
from preexisting vasculature, is a crucial process for tumor progression and metastasis (1). Among the signal pathways involving
angiogenesis, VEGF-A has been shown to be one of the key
mediators of physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis (2).
VEGF-A, a signaling protein released by tumor cells and associated
stroma, predominantly binds to VEGF receptor type 2 (VEGFR2)
and the activation of the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway stimulates endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and vascular permeability (3).
Given the eminent role of VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway in tumor
angiogenesis, growth, and progression, targeting VEGF or its
receptors for therapeutic purposes has been proposed more than
10 years ago (4), and various types of VEGF inhibitors are
currently in different stages of clinical development. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF-A humanized mAb, has been the ﬁrst anti1

molecular markers of neovasculature caused by focal areas of
hypoxia, necrosis, or hemorrhage in cancer. This can result in
sampling errors on consecutive USMI exams with substantial
over- and underestimation of treatment response if only a twodimensional (2D) imaging approach is used (15, 16). Recent
advances in ultrasound transducer technology with the introduction of 3D matrix array transducers have led to a marked improvement of 3D USMI imaging and have made 3D ultrasound molecular imaging (3D USMI) feasible and reproducible (17). However, it is not known whether 3D USMI allows prediction of
longitudinal treatment response of antiangiogenic therapy in
responding and nonresponding tumors.
Therefore, the purpose of our study was to assess whether
VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI using a clinical matrix array transducer
and clinical ultrasound system allows prediction of treatment
response to antiangiogenic therapy in two animal models of colon
cancer that simulate clinical responders and nonresponders.

Materials and Methods
Murine models of responding and nonresponding colon cancer
to antiangiogenic treatment
All experiments involving animals were approved by the Institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. To
simulate clinical responders and nonresponders, two colon cancer cell lines were used: (i) the human colon cancer cell line
LS174T (obtained from ATCC in January 2015), which has been
shown to be sensitive to the treatment of VEGF pathway blockade
(18); and (ii) the murine colon cancer cell line CT26.WT
(obtained from ATCC in February 2015), which has been shown
to be resistant to VEGF pathway blockade (19, 20). Both cell lines
were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco),
penicillin (50 U/mL), and streptomycin (50 mg/mL) at 37 C in a
humidiﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere. Tumor cells were collected after
trypsinization, and 4  106 LS174T cells or 1  106 CT26 cells
suspended in 50 mL PBS and 50-mL Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were
injected subcutaneously on the right lower hind limb of 6–8
weeks old female nude mice (Charles River Laboratories).
Antiangiogenic treatment
Both LS174T and CT26 tumors were allowed to grow for 10
days after cancer cell injection when the tumor reached a maximum diameter of 6–13 mm (mean, 10 mm) as measured by
using an electronic caliper available on the ultrasound system.
Animals with either tumor type were randomized into (i) the
treatment group (n ¼ 8 from each cell type; total, 16 tumors) and
(ii) the control group (n ¼ 8 each; total, 16 tumors). Animals in
the treatment group received bevacizumab (Avastin, 10 mg/kg
injected intravenously; Genentech) on days 0, 3, and 7, and the
control group received sterile saline (Fig. 1).
Three-dimensional ultrasound molecular imaging with
VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles
Three dimensional USMI was performed in all animals on days
0, 1, 3, 7, and 10 by using a clinical ultrasound scanner (EPIQ 7;
Philips Healthcare) and a clinical matrix array transducer (X6-1,
6.0-1.0 MHz frequency, 9212 elements; Philips). To reduce artifacts in the near-ﬁeld zone of the clinical transducer, a 3-cm
customized standoff ultrasound gel was placed on the skin of
mice. In all tumors, 3D USMI was performed in power modulation contrast imaging mode using the following imaging settings:

center frequency, 3.2 MHz, mechanical index, 0.09; volume rate, 1
Hz; dynamic range, 52 dB; imaging focus, 5 cm. All imaging
settings were kept constant during all experiments. The transducer
was ﬁxed in stable position with a clamp to minimize motion
artifacts. All mice were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane in room
air (administered at 2 L/minute) during imaging and placed on a
heated support to maintain constant body temperature for the
whole duration of the experiment. The greatest longitudinal,
transverse, and anteroposterior dimensions of tumors were measured in grayscale imaging using electronic calipers. Tumor volume was determined using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid
(volume ¼ p/6  L  W  H, where L is length, W is width, and H
is height).
Clinical-grade VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles (MBVEGFR2,
BR55, Bracco Suisse; refs. 12, 21), were used for 3D USMI.
MBVEGFR2 is a perﬂuorobutane and nitrogen gas–ﬁlled, phospholipid-shelled microbubble with a mean diameter of 1.5  0.1 mm
(range, 1–3 mm) as assessed by using a cell counter and sizer
(Multisizer III Coulter Counter, Beckman Coulter), and functionalized with a VEGFR2-binding heterodimeric peptide (5.5 kDa;
dissociation constant, Kd ¼ 0.5 nmol/L; refs. 22, 23). The mean
number of heterodimeric peptides per square micrometer of the
microbubble shell was 34,200  1,300 (range, 31,800–36,600;
ref. 13).
MBVEGFR2 (5  107 microbubbles;100 mL) were injected at a
constant injection rate within 5 seconds by using an infusion
pump (Kent Scientiﬁc) through a 27G needle catheter (Vevo
Micromarker; VisualSonics) placed in a tail vein. Four minutes
after microbubbles injection, which allowed the microbubbles to
circulate through the whole tumor volume and attach to VEGFR2,
a sequence of two high-power ultrasound pulses (mechanical
index, 0.72) was applied for a 2-second duration to destroy all
bound and unbound microbubbles in the tumor volume. Sixty
seconds after microbubble destruction (the time needed to fully
replenish the tumor vessels within the tumor volume in the
animal models used, according to our experience), imaging signal
was measured a second time and the 3D USMI imaging signal
intensity from molecularly bound MBVEGFR2 was quantiﬁed as the
difference in imaging signals before and after the high-power
ultrasound pulses as described previously (17, 24, 25). The entire

Monitoring Antiangiogenic Treatment with 3D USMI

3D USMI imaging sequence was recorded in real time by using a
built-in Digital Navigation Link of the ultrasound system with
custom in-house MevisLab modules written in Cþþ (26).
To conﬁrm binding speciﬁcity of MBVEGFR2 to VEGFR2, a subset
of mice with either LS174T (n ¼ 6) or CT26 (n ¼ 6; both randomly
chosen from control mice during the treatment course and from
treated mice at day 0 before antiangiogenic treatment), was
imaged with nontargeted control microbubbles (MBControl with
the same composition as MBVEGFR2 except the lack of VEGFR2speciﬁc lipopeptide) after two separate sequential microbubble
injections. A minimum of 30 minutes of waiting time between
MBControl and MBVEGFR2 injections was allowed for clearance of
microbubbles from previous injections (27, 28).
Image analysis of 3D USMI datasets
All 3D USMI datasets were analyzed by one reader blinded to
the treatments status with a custom software, which was developed by using the software package of MeVisLab (29). A volume
of interest (VOI) was manually contoured covering the whole
tumor visualized on sagittal, longitudinal, and coronal planes.
Results obtained from the selected VOI represented a linear
depiction of the signal intensity from molecularly attached microbubbles, and the intensity is linked to microbubble concentration
(30). Tumor volume and 3D USMI signals intensities after treatment were normalized to the baseline values (day 0).

3D USMI signal intensities in the same tumor by using targeted
versus nontargeted microbubbles were performed by using a
paired-samples Wilcoxon rank test. To assess whether relative
changes in 3D USMI signal intensity at day 1 could predict
treatment response at a later time point at day 10, imaging signals
were compared with the relative change of tumor volume at day
10 with tumor progression deﬁned as a 4-fold or more increase in
tumor volume. The proportions of true positives and negatives
were estimated and the 95% conﬁdence intervals were constructed with exact method due to small sample sizes. All
analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc). A
P value of < 0.05 or less was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Effect of antiangiogenic treatment on tumor growth
Before treatment (day 0), tumor volumes were not signiﬁcantly
different between control and treated mice for both responding
(LS174T, P ¼ 0.226) and nonresponding (CT26, P ¼ 0.833) colon
cancer. In responding tumors, tumor volumes increased signiﬁcantly more in saline-treated mice (by 537%; P ¼ 0.001) compared with bevacizumab-treated mice (by 86%). On days 3, 7, and
10, the relative increase in tumor volume (P ¼ 0.001) in bevacizumab-treated mice was signiﬁcantly smaller compared with
saline-treated mice, while there was no signiﬁcant difference at
day 1 (P ¼ 0.674). In contrast, in nonresponding tumors, tumor
volumes in both bevacizumab-treated (by 799%) and salinetreated (by 839%) mice signiﬁcantly increased (P ¼ 0.012) at all
four time points. There were no signiﬁcant differences in relative
increase of tumor volumes compared with baseline between
bevacizumab-treated and saline-treated at any timepoint (P ¼
0.345–0.916) in nonresponding tumors (Fig. 2).

Ex vivo analysis of tumors
All mice were sacriﬁced at day 10 after imaging and tumors were
excised for ex vivo analysis. Tumor tissues were ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and PBS solution for 24 hours, followed by
30% sucrose and PBS solution (Sigma Aldrich) for up to 3 days.
Tumor tissues were embedded in optimum cutting temperature
(OCT, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), and then sectioned into 10-mm
slices for immunoﬂuorescence staining. Standard methods for
immunoﬂuorescence were used. Brieﬂy, the sections were rinsed
with PBS for 10 minutes to remove remaining OCT and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X 100 for 10 minutes. Incubation in a
solution containing 3% BSA (Sigma), 3% goat serum (Sigma),
and 3% donkey serum (Sigma) for up to 5 hours was performed to
block nonspeciﬁc proteins. Sections were then simultaneously
incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies [1:100 rat
anti-mouse CD31 antibody (eBioscience) and 1:50 rabbit antimouse VEGFR2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology)], followed
by incubation of secondary antibodies of 1:250 AlexaFluor 546
goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; Invitrogen) and 1:250
AlexaFluor488 donkey anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes.
Samples were mounted by using ProLong Gold (BiogeneX).
Fluorescent micrographs were captured by using a LSM510 metaconfocal microscope (Zeiss) attached to a digital camera (AxioCam MRc) using a 20 objective. Quantitative immunoﬂuorescence of VEGFR2 expression and the percentage area of blood
vessels per ﬁeld of view was performed by using ImageJ software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD) as the average value from 5 randomly
selected ﬁelds of view (single ﬁeld of view area, 0.19 mm2).

Longitudinal change of VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI signal and
prediction of treatment response
In responding tumors, although tumor volume (normalized to
baseline) of treated and control mice were not signiﬁcantly
different (P ¼ 0.674) at 1 day after the initiation of bevacizumab
treatment, 3D USMI signal was signiﬁcantly lower (by on average
64%; P ¼ 0.001) in bevacizumab-treated compared with salinetreated mice at day 1 as well as on all subsequent time points
(by 73% at days 3, P ¼ 0.001; by 88% at day 7, P ¼ 0.001; and by
88% at day 10, P ¼ 0.001). 3D USMI signal did not signiﬁcantly
change in saline-treated mice on the ﬁrst three time points (day 1:
P ¼ 0.106; day 3: P ¼ 1.0; day 7: P ¼ 0.139), but then signiﬁcantly
decreased at day 10 by 51% (P ¼ 0.018), likely due to tumor
necrosis (see Discussion).
In contrast, in nonresponding tumors, there were no signiﬁcant
differences in 3D USMI signals in bevacizumab- or saline-treated
mice on anytime point (P ¼ 0.752–0.916; Table 1; Figs. 3 and 4).
At 30% or more decrease of the 3D USMI signal at day 1 after
initiation of antiangiogenic therapy, a positive treatment response
could be predicted in 100% of responding and nonresponding
tumors, respectively (95% CI, 68.5%–100%).

Statistical analysis
Paired-samples Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare the
changes in 3D USMI signal intensity and tumor volume after
treatment. Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare tumor
volume, 3D USMI signal, and ex vivo VEGFR2 expression levels in
antiangiogenic treated and control groups. Comparisons of

Binding speciﬁcity of targeted microbubbles to VEGFR2
In a subset of 6 mice per tumor type, both MBVEGFR2 and
MBControl were injected during the same imaging session. In both
tumor types, the 3D USMI signal was signiﬁcantly higher (P ¼
0.028) after MBVEGFR2 injection (6.57  105  3.88  105 a.u. in
LS174T and 5.35  105  2.94  105 a.u. in CT26 tumors)

compared with saline-treated tumors (1,150  227 a.u., P ¼

In contrast, in nonresponding tumor, there were no significant differences in both the percentage area of blood vessels
between bevacizumab-treated and saline-treated tumors. The
percentage area of blood vessels was 4.84%  0.85% in bevacizumab-treated and 4.77%  0.98% in saline-treated tumors
(P ¼ 0.798). Likewise, VEGFR2 ﬂuorescence signal was not
signiﬁcantly different (P ¼ 0.721) in bevacizumab-treated
(1,298.40  117.63 a.u.) compared with saline-treated tumors
(1,331.49  112.40 a.u.; Fig. 5).

Discussion
Our results showed that VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI signal
changes differently over the course of a 10-day antiangiogenic
treatment regimen in two colon cancer types simulating responding and nonresponding tumors in mice. In responding tumors,
VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI signal substantially decreased as early
as 24 hours after treatment initiation, while in nonresponding
tumors there was no change at any time point. Furthermore, early
change of VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI at day 1 was predictive of

treatment response at day 10 while tumor volume was not
predictive of treatment response.
Although clinical trials have shown that antiangiogenic therapy, either alone or in combination with ﬁrst-line chemotherapy,
is beneﬁcial in several cancers including colon cancer (5), lung
cancer (31), and hepatocellular carcinoma (32), resistance to
angiogenic inhibitors may occur; this can lead to disease recurrence, one of the major challenges associated with antiangiogenic
therapy (7, 33). To simulate patients that developed resistance
and those that respond to antiangiogenic therapy in preclinical
experiments, two different colon cancer cell lines were used in our
study. The LS174T human colon cancer cell line, which has been
previously shown to be sensitive to the treatment of bevacizumab
(18, 34), was used to represent responding tumors in our study. As
expected, bevacizumab treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited the
growth of LS174T colon cancer compared with saline-treated
mice in our study. The CT26 murine colon cancer cell line was
used to represent nonresponding tumors in our study. Previous
studies have shown that CT26 colon tumors are resistant to VEGF
pathway blockade as tumor neoangiogenesis can occur via VEGFindependent mechanisms in CT26 tumors (19, 20). Furthermore,
bevacizumab, which is a humanized VEGF-neutralizing mAb, is
species speciﬁc with no interaction with murine VEGF (35, 36). A
recent study showed no growth inhibition of bevacizumab in
CT26 tumors in mice (37), which was conﬁrmed in our study with
tumor volumes increasing by 839% and 799%, respectively, at
day 10 in both bevacizumab- and saline-treated tumors. The use
of the two tumor types to simulate responding and nonresponding colon cancers was further corroborated by quantitative immunoﬂuorescence used as reference standard in our study. Treated
LS174T tumors showed a substantial decrease in percentage area

relatively low cost allowing to perform repetitive exams during the
course of treatment, in particular during the early course of
treatment, to assess whether early changes of imaging signal may
be predictive of treatment response. With the use of molecularly
targeted contrast microbubbles, 2D USMI has been shown to be
feasible for monitoring tumor antiangiogenic treatment (13, 14).

However, one of the major limitations of 2D USMI in monitoring
tumor response compared with whole body imaging modalities
such as CT, MRI, or PET is the limited ﬁeld of view only representing a small fraction of the imaged tumor volumes. This can result
in substantial sampling errors as shown previously for 2D USMI
(15, 17) due to the known spatial heterogeneity of the neovasculature in cancer with heterogeneous expression of angiogenic
markers such as VEGFR2 across the tumor volume (42, 43). This
becomes particularly problematic when repetitive imaging is
required during longitudinal assessment of treatment response.
Therefore, 3D USMI allowing for volumetric assessment of
VEGFR2 expression across the entire tumor volume is critically
needed to allow for a more robust longitudinal evaluation of
treatment response in cancer using ultrasound.
Recently, 3D USMI has been shown to be technically feasible
and highly reproducible for assessing tumor angiogenesis with
the use of a previous generation IU22 clinical US system (17). In
that study (17), the importance of 3D capabilities in USMI has
been highlighted with an average variability in signal change of
on average 27% (ranging between 2% and 73%) between 3D
and 2D USMI in tumors treated with antiangiogenic therapy. In

4086 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

our study, we extend those initial ﬁndings and bring them into a
more clinical context by investigating whether 3D USMI could
be used to monitor antiangiogenic treatment response over
several treatment cycles up to 10 days and whether differentiation between responding from nonresponding tumors is possible based on the magnitude of volumetric VEGFR2-targeted
USMI signal intensities using a clinical-grade VEGFR2-targeted
contrast microbubble and the latest generation clinical EPIQ7
US system, further optimized for molecular ultrasound imaging.
Our results showed that VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI signal was
signiﬁcantly decreased compared with baseline values in
responding tumor as early as one day after initiation of bevacizumab treatment, while there were no signiﬁcant changes in
VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI in nonresponding tumors. This early
decrease in 3D USMI signal was predictive of later time point
treatment response assessed at day 10. We chose day 10 as
treatment response endpoint as the longest time point as
beyond that time both tumor types became substantially necrotic. Occurrence of tumor necrosis in large subcutaneous tumor
models is a well-described phenomenon (44, 45). As we used a
clinical transducer primarily used for abdominal imaging in

Monitoring Antiangiogenic Treatment with 3D USMI

patients with a center frequency of 3.2 MHz, after tumor cell
inoculation we waited until a critical tumor diameter of at least
6 mm was reached in mice. By day 10, most tumors reached a
critical size beyond 20 mm, which mandated sacriﬁcing animals
per our institutional guidelines. Interestingly, at day 3 and at
later time points, 3D USMI signal spontaneously decreased in
both tumor types (in LS174T tumors after saline treatment and
in CT26 tumors after bevacizumab or saline treatment). This
may be due to a combination of downregulation of VEGFR2
and evolving tumor necrosis once tumors grow beyond a certain
size, as previously shown for subcutaneous ovarian, pancreatic,
and breast cancers (46).
We acknowledge several limitations of our study. First, as
mentioned above, we could only monitor treatment response
for 10 days due to the fast tumor growth in mice and our
model therefore cannot simulate and assess longer term treatment outcome assessment usually performed between 8 and
12 weeks after treatment initiation in cancer patients. As such a
long treatment cycle is challenging to simulate in preclinical
animal models, future studies in patients are warranted to
assess the prognostic value of early changes in VEGFR2-targeted 3D USMI signal in terms of longer term treatment outcomes. Second, a cell line that is known to be resistant to
VEGF pathway blockade was used to simulate clinical nonresponders, which might not fully represent the clinical situation with tumor resistance evolving during antiangiogenic
treatment (7).Therefore, as a next step, clinical translational
studies are needed to assess the potential of 3D USMI to
predict early treatment response in cancer patients. The
VEGFR2-targeted contrast microbubble used in our study has
recently received FDA investigational new drug (IND) approval and a phase II clinical trial is ongoing in the United States to
evaluate its safety and efﬁcacy to assess VEGFR2 expression in
cancer patients (47). Finally, for the 3D USMI protocol, we
chose to wait 60 seconds after the destructive pulse to obtain
postdestructive 3D USMI data as in the colon cancer tumor
models used in our study it takes that long for all tumor vessel
to fully replenish based on our experience. This is substantially
longer than the few seconds commonly used for 2D USMI and
might have inﬂuences our absolute USMI signal values using
targeted and control microbubbles in at least two ways: First,
during the waiting time of 60 seconds, the targeted contrast
agent had time to bind again to the molecular target; this may
have increased the postdestructive pulse 3D USMI signal,
thereby decreasing the calculated signal. Second, as nonattached microbubbles are cleared via the reticular endothelial
system, the signal from freely circulating microbubbles may
have been further decreased compared with the predestructive
pulse during the 60-second interval, which may have increased
the calculated signal. Alternative strategies of quantifying
USMI are currently being explored (48–50) that allow more

real-time measurements of the targeted USMI signal without
the need for a destructive pulse or a long enough waiting time
until nonattached freely circulating microbubbles have fully
cleared from the circulation. Such strategies are eventually
needed when moving 3D USMI into the clinics as high powered destructive pulses as used in our study for diagnostic
purposes may cause unwarranted biologic effects (51, 52) and
as real-time imaging without the need of postprocessing
improves the workﬂow of USMI.
In conclusion, our study suggests that 3D USMI using a clinical
US system with a clinical 3D transducer and clinical grade
VEGFR2-targeted contrast microbubbles allows longitudinal
monitoring of antiangiogenic treatment response in two colon
cancer models simulating clinical responders and nonresponders
to antiangiogenic therapy. As US is widely available, relatively
inexpensive, and does not expose patients to radiation, our study
lays the foundation to further develop 3D USMI for clinical
translation to allow assessment of early treatment response at
the molecular level in cancer patients.
