ABSTRACT
Prognosis for patients suffering from T-ALL is still very poor and new strategies
for T-ALL treatment are urgently needed. Our study shows potent anti-leukemic
effects of the myxobacterial V-ATPase inhibitor Archazolid A. Archazolid A reduced
growth and potently induced death of leukemic cell lines and human leukemic
samples. By inhibiting lysosomal acidification, Archazolid A blocked activation of the
Notch pathway, however, this was not the mechanism of V-ATPase inhibition relevant
for cell death induction. In fact, V-ATPase inhibition by Archazolid A decreased the
anti-apoptotic protein survivin. As underlying mode of action, this work is in line
with recent studies from our group demonstrating that Archazolid A induced S-phase
cell cycle arrest by interfering with the iron metabolism in leukemic cells. Our study
provides evidence for V-ATPase inhibition as a potential new therapeutic option for
T-ALL.

INTRODUCTION

Notch1 activating cleavage have been widely tested in
preclinical models and clinical trials. However, the role
of Notch in leukemia is still not entirely clear: on the
one hand, it was shown that Notch signaling promotes
cell survival and apoptosis resistance in leukemia [4, 5]
and that Notch blockade by γ-secretase inhibition exerts
pro-apoptotic effects in leukemia [6]. On the other hand,
activation of Notch or of the Notch downstream target
Hes1 inhibits leukemia development, growth and survival
[7-9]. Furthermore, GSIs have shown only modest
and temporary responses in leukemia therapy. These
controversial results about Notch in leukemia demand for
better understanding of the mechanisms that contribute
to Notch signaling in leukemia in order to develop novel
strategies to inhibit Notch1 signaling with alternative
mechanism different from GSIs as potential promising
approaches for T-ALL therapy.
Besides Notch activation at the plasma membrane

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an
aggressive hematopoietic malignancy. Despite advances
in understanding of the molecular basis of T-ALL and
intensified treatment regimens that have improved
outcome of therapy, some patients fail conventional
chemotherapy and T-ALL remains fatal in 20% of children
and more than 50% of adults [1]. Along this line, new
therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to improve
patient prognosis.
Activating mutations in Notch1 occur in more than
50% of T-ALLs, highlighting Notch1 as key player in
T-ALL [2, 3]. In fact, constitutive activation of Notch1
signaling represents the most prominent oncogenic
pathway in T-cell transformation [1]. Therefore, targeted
therapies to inhibit the Notch1 pathway have been
developed. γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) that prevent

where ligand binding initiates y-secretase dependent
cleavage of the Notch receptor, and subsequently NICD
generation and translocation to the nucleus, Notch
signaling in part depends on endocytosis. Recent reports
showed that Notch can be activated in endosomes: in
drosophila, Notch signaling is abolished when endosomal
entry is blocked but is enhanced when endosomal retention
is increased [10]. Moreover, in drosophila, acidification
of endosomes by the V-ATPase is required for Notch
activation [11].
Along this line, we hypothesized that inhibition
of V-ATPase might be a promising strategy for T-ALL
treatment. V-ATPase is an ATP-dependent proton pump
that regulates pH homeostasis by translocating protons
across membranes. The main function of V-ATPase is to
regulate the acidification of intracellular compartments
like lysosomes [12, 13]. V-ATPases are multisubunit
heteromeric protein complexes with two functional
domains: the V1 domain that is composed of eight subunits
(A-H) mediates ATP hydrolysis and the V0 domain that
is composed of five subunits (a, c, c’’, d, e) regulates
proton translocation [14]. The V-ATPase is localized at
endosomes and lysosomes and is essential for endocytotic
processes, receptor internalization and recycling, and
finally lysosomal degradation [13]. Therefore, V-ATPase
is implicated in fundamental physiological processes,
like neurotransmitter uptake, renal acidification, bone
resorption or sperm maturation and is associated with
pathologic conditions including osteopetrosis, renal
tubular acidosis and disease-related processes such as
entry of toxins and viruses [13].
Recent reports indicate important functions of
V-ATPase in tumors. Augmented expression of V-ATPase
in cancer cells was demonstrated to contribute to
metastasis, survival and growth of cancer cells [15-18].
Localization of V-ATPase at the plasma membrane was
associated with invasiveness of various types of cancer
including breast, pancreatic, prostate, and melanoma
cancer cells [14, 19-21]. V-ATPase was shown to localize
to the plasma membrane in sarcoma cells as well and
was elucidated as a promising target for Ewing sarcoma,
osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma
[22, 23] as well as glioblastoma [24, 25]. Along this line,
V-ATPase inhibition could represent a promising approach
for tumor therapy. Although only few V-ATPase inhibitors
have been described so far, their V-ATPase binding
properties and mode of action are well-investigated.
Amongst others, a class of natural compounds - the
Archazolids - inhibits V-ATPase activity by binding to
the V-ATPase V0 subunit [26-28] that is responsible for
proton transport across the membrane [29]. Archazolids
are macrolides that have originally been isolated from
the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra [30], and are
available also by chemical synthesis [31, 32]. Archazolids
have attracted attention as highly potent V-ATPase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitors that exert promising anti-tumor effects [15-18,
33-36].
Because Notch signaling activation in part depends
on endocytosis [10, 11, 37] and V-ATPase has therefore
been linked with the Notch pathway [35, 38], we
hypothesized that V-ATPase inhibition might represent
an alternative option to target leukemic cells. Therefore,
we had a closer look on the functional effects and the
mechanism of action, including the Notch pathway
and cellular stress response, of the V-ATPase inhibitor
Archazolid A in leukemic cells.

RESULTS
V-ATPase in leukemic cells
First, we analyzed the expression of the V-ATPase
subunits in different leukemic cell lines including the
T-ALL cell lines Jurkat and CEM, the AML cell line HL60,
and the CML cell line K562 in comparison to non-tumor
primary human PBMCs. Most of the V-ATPase subunits
were comparably expressed in non-tumor PBMCs, Jurkat,
CEM, and HL60 cells and some subunits were increased
in K562 cells (Table 1). Immunostainings show that
subunit c ATP6V0C which is targeted by Archazolid A,
is localized to the lysosomal system and to the plasma
membrane of leukemic cells (Figure 1A). As V-ATPase
is essential for endo-lysosomal function, we analyzed
the size of the endo-lysosomal compartment. In fact,
the size of the endosomal compartment was increased in
leukemic cell lines compared to non-tumor primary human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Figure 1B).
This set of data suggests a potential function of V-ATPase
in leukemia.

V-ATPase inhibition by Archazolid A impairs
growth and induces death of leukemic cell lines
Archazolid A inhibited V-ATPase activity in
leukemic cells as shown by staining of lysosomes with a
pH-sensitive fluorescence dye (LysoTracker) (Figure 2A).
Archazolid A impaired proliferation of leukemic cell lines
Jurkat (EC50 0.56 nM) and CEM (EC50 0.51 nM) (Figure
2B, 2C). In line, clonogenic growth of Jurkat and CEM
cells was reduced by V-ATPase inhibition (Figure 2D, 2E).
Moreover, as shown by Nicoletti assay (Figure 3A,
3B) and Annexin V staining (Figure 3C), Archazolid A
potently induced death of leukemic cell lines. In line with a
previous report from our group [15], Archazolid A induced
cleavage of procaspase-3, procaspase-9, and PARP,
increased the pro-apoptotic protein BNIP3, and decreased
the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in leukemic cells (Figure
3D). Moreover, the pan-caspase inhibitor QVC-OPh

repetitive in vitro testing on viable patient-derived cells,
by passaging primary tumor cells in severely immunocompromised mice. These cells resemble the primary
patient cells to a very high extent [39, 40]. In accordance
with cell culture experiments, Archazolid A reduced
viability (Figure 4A) and induced death of PDX human
leukemic cell samples from different patients which was
again shown by PI exclusion assays (Figure 4B) and
Annexin V staining (Figure 4C). Moreover, Archazolid
A induced cleavage of procaspase-3 in PDX samples
(Figure 4D). This set of data demonstrates that V-ATPase

least partially mediated via the mitochondrial pathway.

Because Archazolid A did not induce cell death of nontumor primary human PBMCs (Figure 4E) it might
represent an option for anti-leukemic treatment.

Inhibition of y-secretase impairs growth but does
not induce death of leukemic cell lines

V-ATPase inhibition by Archazolid A addresses
Notch1 signaling in leukemic cells, but the Notch
pathway is not responsible for Archazolid A
induced cell death

DBZ-mediated γ-secretase inhibition reduced
proliferation of leukemic cell lines Jurkat (EC50 15.5
µM) and CEM (EC50 12.7 µM) (Figure 7A, 7B) as well
as clonogenic growth (Figure 7C, 7D). However, DBZ
neither induced death of leukemic cell lines (Figure 7E7G), nor of human leukemic PDX samples (Figure 7H).
This set of data suggests that the Notch1 pathway is not
essential for the effects of Archazolid A on leukemic cell
death.

In order to evaluate the mechanism of Archazolid A
to induce leukemic cell death, the Notch pathway gained
our attention. Expression of the Notch1 downstream
target Hes1 was reduced by Archazolid A as well as by
the y-secretase inhibitor (GSI) Dibenzazepine (DBZ)
that served as positive control for Notch signaling
inhibition (Figure 5A). Archazolid A reduced levels of
Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) and the Notch1
downstream target c-myc (Figure 5B). As expected, DBZ
treatment decreased NICD and c-myc as well. NICD
expression revealed that the Notch1 pathway was active
in PDX samples (Figure 5C). Archazolid A-mediated
decrease of NICD (Figure 5C) proved that Archazolid A
addressed the Notch1 pathway in PDX cells. Archazolid A
induced cell death in these PDX samples as well (Figure
4C and 10A), suggesting sensitivity of leukemic cells
with Notch1 pathway activation towards Archazolid A.
Moreover, Archazolid A increased levels of the Notch1
whole receptor (Figure 5B). This was further analyzed by
immunostainings which demonstrate again that Archazolid
A abrogated NICD levels whereas the Notch1 whole
receptor was increased (Figure 5D). Stainings for the
lysosomal marker LAMP1 revealed large lysosomes that
contained increased amounts of Notch1 in Archazolid A
treated cells (Figure 5E). This suggested that Archazolid
A inhibits Notch1 signaling in a way different from GSI:
by capturing the Notch1 whole receptor in lysosomes and
therefore inhibiting Notch1 cleavage and NICD generation
at endolysosomal membranes.
However, NICD overexpression could not rescue
from Archazolid A-mediated cell death (Figure 6A),
suggesting no causal relationship between the Notch1
pathway and Archazolid A-induced leukemic cell death.
Nevertheless, NICD overexpression induced Notch1
downstream target gene expression (Figure 6B) and
rescued DBZ-induced inhibition of proliferation (Figure
6C), proving that NICD overexpression was functional.
In order to better understand the inter-connection between
V-ATPase and Notch1, we analyzed whether Notch
inhibition affects levels of V-ATPase c-subunit. V-ATPase
c-subunit expression was not affected by DBZ treatment
(Figure 6D). This set of data indicated that Notch1
signaling inhibition is not the major relevant downstream
signaling of Archazolid A in leukemic cell death induction.

Archazolid A decreases survivin by inducing
cell cycle arrest and interfering with the iron
metabolism in leukemic cells
In search for other pathways of Archazolid A
responsible for cell death, we analyzed the anti-apoptotic
protein survivin, a crucial regulator of cell death in
leukemic cells [41-43]. In fact, Archazolid A decreased
survivin protein levels (Figure 8A, 8B and Supplementary
Figure 1) which was not due to changed survivin mRNA
(Figure 8C). In contrast, DBZ showed no significant effect
on survivin (Figure 8A-8C), again providing evidence
that Archazolid A-mediated anti-leukemic effects are not
based on Notch1 inhibition. Because survivin expression
strongly depends on the cell cycle [41-43], subsequently,
cell cycle analysis was performed. In fact, cells without
Archazolid A treatment pass S-phase (8h) to reach (16h)
and accumulate (20h, 24h) in G2-phase. In contrast,
Archazolid A treated cells accumulate in S-phase (8h,
16h, 20h) but do not traverse to G2-phase. This suggests
that Archazolid A treated cells die during S-phase which is
confirmed by cell death analysis showing that Archazolid
A-induced S-phase arrest is in parallel with apoptosis
induction (Figure 8D).
In line with recent studies from our group [15, 44]
that elucidated that interference of Archazolid with the
iron metabolism leads to S-phase cell cycle arrest in breast
cancer, Archazolid A stabilized Hif1α in leukemic cells
(Figure 9A-9C) which was abrogated by simultaneous
treatment with iron citrate (Figure 9C). In contrast, Notch
inhibition by DBZ did not affect Hif1α (Figure 9D). As
shown previously [44], Archazolid A-mediated cell death
was partially rescued by iron citrate (Figure 9E). Because
Hif1α stabilization is generally pro-proliferative, but
also anti-proliferative and cell death inducing properties
have been described [45-48], we analyzed the effects of
Hif1α induction on cell death and survivin expression in
leukemic cells. Induction of Hif1α by deferoxamine (DFO)
induced leukemic cell death and decreased survivin,
which was even enhanced by concomitant Archazolid A
treatment (Figure 9F, 9G). This set of data suggests that
interference of Archazolid A with the iron metabolism

Finally, coincident with apoptosis induction,
survivin levels were decreased by Archazolid A treatment
of PDX human patient samples as shown for the PDX
samples PDX ALL-363 and PDX ALL-256 (Figure 10A,
Figure 4C). Moreover, survivin overexpression partially
rescued Archazolid A induced cell death in leukemic cells
(Figure 10B). This set of data suggests decreased survivin
as relevant mechanism of Archazolid A to induce leukemic
cell death.

V-ATPase inhibition as potential option for T-ALL
treatment.
During recent years, V-ATPase has emerged as
interesting target for cancer therapy. Amongst others,
including various studies of our group, it has been shown
that V-ATPase is implicated in cancer cell metastasis [16,
49], invasion [50, 51], tumor cell death [15, 52], anoikis
resistance [17], cellular stress response [15], breast cancer
trastuzumab resistance [34], and regulation of the secretion
profile of cancer and cancer-associated cells [18, 53]. Only
few reports point to a function of V-ATPase in leukemia or

leukemic cell adhesion [56] and V-ATPase inhibition by
Bafilomycin A reduced leukemic cell growth [35].
In search for the signaling pathway responsible
for the anti-leukemic effects of Archazolid A-mediated
V-ATPase inhibition, first the Notch pathway was
analyzed as it is one of the most prominent oncogenic
pathways in T-ALL [57]. Targeted therapies addressing
the Notch pathway have been proposed as auspicious
options for T-ALL treatment. Despite promising in vitro
results and initial clinical effectiveness of GSIs that block
Notch activatory cleavage, this benefit only in some
studies translates into improved overall survival [5860]. In fact, most human T-ALL cell lines are resistant
to GSIs that fail to induce leukemic cell death [57].
Therefore, to inhibit Notch signaling with a mechanism
different from GSIs might be a promising approach. Our
study shows that V-ATPase reduces Notch1 signaling by
capturing the Notch whole receptor in the endolysosomal
compartment and inhibiting its activatory cleavage.
This is in line with reports demonstrating that impaired
endolysosomal function by V-ATPase inhibition blocks
γ-secretase mediated Notch activatory cleavage at the
endolysosomal membrane [11, 35, 37, 38]. However,
our rescue experiments revealed that leukemic cell death
by Archazolid A was not caused by inhibition of Notch
signaling. Moreover, although our results revealed that
GSI treatment reduced leukemic cell growth, cell death
was not induced. Thus, Archazolid A-mediated induction
of leukemic cell death was not based on Notch1 pathway
inhibition.
Our work suggests the anti-apoptotic protein
survivin as target addressed by Archazolid A to induce
leukemic cell death. Survivin exerts multiple cellular
functions: it participates in the regulation of cell
division, apoptosis, stress response, migration, and
metastasis. Whereas it is nearly absent in normal tissues,
it is overexpressed in most human tumors, including
hematopoietic malignancies [42, 43, 61-63]. Survivin
expression has been associated with leukemia progression
and poor clinical outcome [64-66]. In consequence,
survivin is addressed in cancer therapy by molecular
antagonists like antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA, or
hammerhead ribozymes, as well as small molecules or
cancer immunotherapeutics [67]. Inhibition of survivin
has shown clinical benefits and chemosensitizing effects
in leukemia [42, 43, 68-70]. By describing potent antileukemic effects of Archazolid A, our study probably
expands the class of small molecule survivin antagonists.
Survivin expression strongly depends on the cell
cycle, i.e. survivin is upregulated and stabilized during
G2-phase [41]. Besides regulation at the transcriptional
level, changes in protein stability essentially contribute
to survivin expression during the cell cycle: proteasomedependent destruction of survivin has been shown
in interphase cells whereas at metaphase, mitotic
phosphorylation of survivin by Cdk1 has been associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with increased protein stability [71]. In fact, in line with
recent studies from our group addressing V-ATPase
in cancer [15, 44], our results presented here suggest
that Archazolid decreased survivin at the protein level
by inducing S-phase cell cycle arrest in leukemic cells
which probably was due to its interference with the iron
metabolism.
In line with previous studies from our group
showing that Archazolid B led to cellular stress response
and induction of Hif1α [15, 44], our present study suggests
that the induction of Hif1α contributes to Archazolid A
induced leukemic cell death. Although the stabilization
of Hif1α during hypoxia is generally pro-proliferative
as stabilization of Hif1α influences the survival of tumor
cells, Hif1α has also tumor-inhibiting properties. In
detail, Hif1α overexpression inhibits cell proliferation by
expressing cell cycle inhibitors like p53, p21, and p27 and
promotes apoptosis by inducing pro-apoptotic molecules
such as p53, Nip3, and Noxa [45-48].
A recent study from our group demonstrated that
inhibition of V-ATPase by Archazolid B led to iron
depletion by disruption of transferrin receptor recycling
which subsequently reduced ribonucleotide reductase
(RNR) activity, induced S-phase cell cycle arrest and
finally caused cell death [44]. Interestingly, iron overload
due to inefficient erythropoiesis or blood transfusion
represents a major problem in patients suffering from
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), clonal disorders
with ineffective hematopoiesis and an increased risk of
transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. Iron overload
is associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis in these
patients [72, 73]. In consequence, V-ATPase inhibition in
hematopoietic diseases might be an interesting object for
further studies.
To conclude, our study provides evidence for
V-ATPase inhibition as new alternative strategy and
Archazolid A as interesting new compound for T-ALL
therapy.

Reagents

Tansfection of cells

The γ-secretase inhibitor DBZ was purchased from
Merck Millipore. The pan-caspase inhibitor QVD-OPh
(551476) was purchased from Calbiochem. Deferoxamine
(DFO) was purchased from Sigma.

Cell transfection was performed by using the
Amaxxa system with the cell line nucleofector kit V
(Lonza, VCA-1003) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 1×106 cells were electroporated (program
X-001). NICD plasmid was from addgene (20183).
Survivin plasmid was from Sino Biologicals (pCMV3BIRC5-myc, HG10356-CM G09AU4M62). For respective
assays, cells were used 24h (NICD) or 48h (survivin) after
transfection.

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) leukemic cells
The xenograft mouse model, the transplantation of
patient’s primary tumor cells, and the cell amplification
have been described previously [39, 40]. In detail,
primary leukemic cells were obtained from diagnostic
bone marrow aspiration or peripheral blood sampling
before onset of treatment. Xenografts were established
by injecting 107 fresh or frozen/thawed primary leukemic
cells into NSG mice (NOD SCID gamma mice, i.e. mice
with dysfunctional gamma chain of the IL-2R receptor)
by tail vein injection. Development of leukemia was
monitored by repetitive blood sampling in mice and by
determining human leukemic cells in flow cytometry
upon staining of murine CD45 and human CD38. At clear
leukemic engraftment or by latest after 25 weeks, mice
were sacrificed and human patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) leukemic cells were isolated either from bone
marrow or from spleens of mice using Ficoll purification.
Phenotypic markers and genetic aberrations in PDX cells
compared to primary leukemic tumor cells remained
mainly stable as shown before [25]. For stimulation and
during experiments, cells were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium containing 20% FCS and 1% glutamine. Freshly
isolated PDX leukemic cells were stimulated as indicated
in vitro.

Proliferation
CellTiter-Blue® assay was performed according
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded
(96 well plates, 3×103 cells/well) for 24 h, treated with
Archazolid A or DBZ at indicated concentrations and
incubated for 70 h. CTB solution (20μl) was added and
cells were incubated for 2h. Fluorescence was measured
with a Tecan reader (Maennedorf, Austria).

PDX viability
PDX leukemic cells were seeded (96 well
plates, 1x105 cells/well) and the cells were treated with
Archazolid A at indicated concentrations for 72h. Cell
Titer Blue assay was performed according manufacturer’s
instructions as described before at “proliferation”. For
calculating viability, the value from the time of plating
was subtracted.

Apoptosis and cell cycle

Primary non-tumor human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were performed
according to the Nicoletti method [74]. In brief, cells were
seeded (24 well plates, 0.5×104 cells/well for 48 h, 2.5×104
cells/well for 72 h) and treated with Archazolid A or DBZ
at indicated concentrations. For DNA staining, cells were
permeabilized and stained by resuspension in hypotonic
fluorochrome solution (HFS) containing propidium
iodide (PI, 50 µg/ml) and incubated at 4°C overnight.
Subsequently, flow cytometry was performed on a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).
The sub-G1 peak accounts for apoptotic cells and was
determined according to Nicoletti [74]. Cell cycle was
analyzed by using FlowJo 7.6 (Tree Star Unc., Ashland,
USA).

Isolation of primary non-tumor human PBMCs was
performed using the “Ficoll-Paque PLUS” kit from GE
Healthcare according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, EDTA (1.5mg/ml) blood (2 ml) was mixed with
balanced salt solution (2 ml), added on top of Ficoll-Paque
PLUS (3ml) in a 15ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuged
(400×g, 40min, RT). Afterwards, PBMCs were carefully
withdrawn from the interface between the upper plasma
layer and the lower Ficoll-Paque PLUS layer, washed
twice by 3 volumes of balanced salt solution, centifuged
(100×g, 10 min, RT) and resuspended in culture medium
(RPMI 1640+20%FCS+1%Glutamine). PBMCs were
directly used for the respective assays.
For FACS analysis, gating of lymphocytes was
performed and only these cells were included in the
evaluation.

concentrations. Subsequently, cells were incubated with
PI (5 μg/ml, 5 min) that was added to the cell suspension
before analysis by flow cytometry. Subsequently, flow
cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) using the Fl-2 laser.
As cells were not permeabilized, PI staining was
exclusive for dead cells, whereas viable cells were not
stained by PI. For quantification, PI positive dead cells
can be seen in dot plots at the left and in histograms at the
right and are shown in red; PI negative viable cells can be
seen in dot plots at the right and in histograms at the left
and are shown in green (Figure 4A).

Immunoblotting was performed as described
[76]. The following primary antibodies were used: actin
(MAB1501 Millipore), BCL-XL (2762 Cell Signaling),
BNIP3 (ab10433 Abcam), Caspase 3 (sc-7148 Santa
Cruz), Caspase 9 (9506 Cell Signaling), Hif1α (610958
BD), IAP-1 (4952 Cell Signaling), IAP-2 (3130 Cell
Signaling), NICD (4147 Cell Signaling), Notch1 (4380
Cell Signaling), c-Myc (sc-788 Santa Cruz), survivin
(2803 Cell Signaling), β-tubulin (2164 Cell Signaling),
XIAP (610717 BD).

Annexin V/PI staining

RT-PCR

Annexin V/PI staining was performed by using the
Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (eBioscience
Dx, BMS500FI/300CE) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, cells were treated as indicated, collected,
centrifuged (600g, 4 oC, 10min), washed with PBS,
centrifuged again (600g, 4 oC, 10min) and resuspended
in binding buffer. 5μl AnnexinV-FITC were added to
195μl of cell suspension, cells were mixed and incubated
at RT for 10 min (cover from light), centrifuged (600g,
4 oC, 10min), washed with 200μl Binding Buffer and
resuspended in Binding Buffer. 10μl PI (20μg/ml) was
added to 190 µl of cell suspension and FACS analysis was
performed using Fl-2 and Fl-3 lasers. AnnexinV positive
cells have been considered as apoptotic. AnnexinV
positive and PI negative cells have been considered as
early apoptotic.
For primary PDX leukemic cells, the specific
apoptosis was calculated according to the following
formula: % specific apoptosis = 100 × (% total apoptosis
of treated cells - % total apoptosis of untreated cells) /
(100 - % total apoptosis untreated cells) [75].
For primary non-tumor human PBMCs, gating of
lymphocytes was performed and only these cells were
included in the evaluation.

mRNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini
Kit. For reverse transcription the High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) was
used. RT-PCR was performed with the 7300 Real Time
PCR System.
For RT-PCR of Notch downstream targets, the
following Taqman gene expression assays were used: Hes1
Hs00172878, HEY1 Hs00232618, HEY2 Hs00232622,
NRARP Hs01104102 (Life Technologies Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). GAPDH was used as housekeeper.
For RT-PCR for V-ATPase subunits, SYBR® Green
PCR Master Mix (4309155, Life Technologies) was used.
A list with the primer sequences for all V-ATPase subunits
is included in Supplementary Table 1.

Confocal microscopy

treated as indicated, collected, resuspended and seeded
on chrome alum-gelatin (0.05% CrK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.4%
gelatine in H2O) coated coverslips (30 min). Cells were
fixed (4% PFA, 10mins), permablized (0.2% Triton X
100 in PBS, 5min), blocked (0.2% BSA in PBS, 1 h),
incubated with primary antibodies (0.2% BSA in PBS,
1h) and subsequently secondary antibodies (0.2% BSA in
PBS, 1h) and mounted. The following primary antibodies
were used: EEA1 (sc-6415, Santa Cruz), LAMP1 (H4A3,
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), NICD (4147
Cell Signalling), Notch1 (4308, Cell Signaling). Alexa
Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes)
were used.
