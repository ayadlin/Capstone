ABSTRACT
Introduction
To explore the ability of gefitinib to penetrate blood brain barrier (BBB) during
whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).

Patients and Methods
Enrolled in this study were eligible patients who were diagnosed with BM from
NSCLC. Gefitinib was given at 250 mg/day for 30 days, then concurrently with WBRT
(40 Gy/20 F/4 w), followed by maintenance. Serial CSF and blood samples were
collected on 30 day after gefitinib administration, and at the time of 10, 20, 30 and
40 Gy following WBRT. CSF and plasma samples of 13 patients without BM who were
treated with gefitinib were collected as control. CSF and plasma gefitinib levels were
measured by LC-MS/MS.

Results
Fifteen BM patients completed gefitinib plus WBRT. The CSF-to-plasma ratio of
gefitinib in patients with BM was higher than that in patients without BM (1.34% vs.
0.36%, P < 0.001). The CSF-to-plasma ratio of gefitinib increased with the increased
dose of WBRT and reached the peak (1.87 ± 0.72%) at 30 Gy, which was significantly
higher than that 1.34 ± 0.49% at 0 Gy (P = 0.01). The median time to progression of
brain lesions and the median overall survival were 7.07 and 15.4 months, respectively.

Conclusion
The BBB permeability of gefitinib increased in accordance with escalated dose
of WBRT.

INTRODUCTION

Studies have found that BBB could be destroyed by
radiation [21, 30–31]. Some studies [6, 32–34] reported that
brain radiotherapy increased the penetration of anticancer
drugs such as irinotecan, MTX and cisplatin into the CSF.
Qin et al [33] reported that after irradiation of the brain with
a dose of 20 Gy and intravenous administration of MTX to
patients with brain tumors, the CSF-MTX concentration
increased up to threefold. However, whether addition of
WBRT could increase the permeability of gefitinib across
the BBB remains unknown. In this prospective study, we
evaluated the permeability of gefitinib across the BBB
during WBRT in an attempt to obtain information about the
efficacy and safety of gefitinib treatment with concurrent
WBRT in NSCLC patients with BM.

About 20–40% patients with non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) develop brain metastasis (BM) [1–3]. The
prognosis of BM from NSCLC is very poor with a median
overall survival (OS) about 3–6 months in patients who
received whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). There
are controversies over the role of systemic chemotherapy
because of the limited ability of most potential agents to
cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) [4].
Studies [5] demonstrated that the integrity of BBB was
disrupted in the presence of BM, and the BBB was leaky in
a BM mouse model with tumors > 0.25 mm. In addition,
BM-related blood vessels were dilated and contained
many dividing endothelial cells. Qin et al [6] reported the
image intensity was 22% higher in brain tumor area than
normal brain area by collecting Count/pixel data in 99MTcGH imaging for a patient with BM which demonstrated the
destructive effect of the BBB by brain tumor.
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) play an important treatment
role for NSCLCpopulations worldwide. Gefitinib and
erlotinib are oral EGFR-TKIs and have been approved
in Asia for advanced NSCLC patients who have failed
prior chemotherapy, or as first-line therapy for those with
EGFR activating mutations [7–10]. Recently, gefitinib and
erlotinib have been used for the treatment of patients with
BM from NSCLC and reported effective against BM with
a response rate (RR) of 10–58.3% and a disease control
rate (DCR) of 22–77% in non-selected patients, bringing
a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3–9.7 months
and a median OS of 8.3–18.9 months [11–17]. Whereas
for patients harboring EGFR mutation, Park reported that
the RR in brain was much higher as 83% [18]. Another
study also reported the longer PFS for EGFR-mutated
versus wide-type patients [19].
The role of EGFR-TKI with concurrent WBRT
for NSCLC patients with BM is uncertain. A few
studies showed that the combination of EGFR-TKI with
concurrent WBRT has promising clinical activity. Ma et al
[20] reported that the RR and DCR were 81% and 95%
respectively in 21 NSCLC patients (EGFR non-selected)
with BM treated by concurrent WBRT and gefitinib. Welsh
et al [19] reported that the RR was 86% and the median
OS was 11.8 months in patients treated with concurrent
erlotinib and WBRT. There is no consensus regarding such
treatment in NSCLC patients with BM. Future studies
should focus on the role of EGFR-TKI with concurrent
WBRT in patients with BM for more evidence.
Based on the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs, the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) penetration of EGFR-TKIs is currently being
investigated. Small-molecular-weight gefitinib may have
the ability to penetrate the BBB [5, 21–22]. Studies reported
that the CSF penetration rates of gefitinib and erlotinib were
about 1–1.3% and 2.77–7%, respectively [22–29]. The CSF
penetration rate of EGFR-TKI is relatively low.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the medical ethics
committee of Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center
(Guangzhou, China). Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients before initiation of the study.

Patients
The main inclusion criteria were pathologically
confirmed NSCLC and clinically measurable brain metastases
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Patients with
1–3 brain metastases were also eligible if they refused to
receive neurosurgical or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
Other eligibility criteria included age ≥ 18 years,
ECOG PS of 0–3, a life expectancy > 3 months, and
evidence of adequate hematologic and hepatic function.
All patients were pretreated with at least one line of
chemotherapy regimens or chemotherapy-naïve patients
with EGFR mutations.
The main exclusion criteria included prior WBRT
for BM, prior EGFR inhibitor therapy, uncontrolled active
infection or other serious concomitant disorders, pregnant
patients and patients with mental disorders. Also, those who
had significant neurologic symptoms or signs were excluded,
but those with asymptomatic or controlled symptomatic brain
metastases by corticosteroids or mannitol were included.
In addition, in order to compare the baseline gefitinib
CSF levels in non-BM patients with that in BM patients
before WBRT, the study enrolled 13 patients without BM
as control. They were pathologically confirmed NSCLC
and in the absence of BM by MRI. The patients were
pretreated with at least one line of chemotherapy or
chemotherapy-naïve patients with EGFR mutations and
appropriate for gefitinib treatment.

Treatment
For NSCLC patients with BM, Gefitinib was
administered orally at a daily dose of 250 mg for 30 days,
continued concurrently with WBRT (40 Gy/20 F) for
8367

Oncotarget

4 weeks, and then maintained at the same dosage before
occurrence of severe or intolerable toxicity, disease
progression, or death. For NSCLC patients without BM,
gefitinib was administered orally at a daily dose of 250
mg before occurrence of severe or intolerable toxicity,
disease progression, or death. Tumor tissue specimens
were collected to detect EGFR mutations by DNA direct
sequencing. The study design is shown in Figure 1.
For patients with BM, serial CSF and blood samples
were collected on day 30 after gefitinib administration
before WBRT, and at the time of 10, 20, 30 and 40 Gy
following WBRT. For patients without BM, blood and
CSF samples only on day 30 after gefitinib administration
were collected.

quantified by the internal standard reference method in the
MRM mode by monitoring the transition m/z 447.2→128.1
for the analyte gefitinib and m/z 475.6→112.0 for the
internal standard vandetanib. Standard curves were linear (r2
> 0.99) over the range of 1–600 ng/ml. The lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) of the method was 1 ng/ml. The
extraction recovery for vandetanib in plasma at 50 ng/ml
was 80.62%. For detection of gefitinib in plasma samples,
the extraction recovery of gefitinib at 1, 3, 300, 480 ng/ml
was found in the range of 74.47–84.52%. The intra- and
inter-batch precisions (RSD %) and the intra- and interbatch accuracies were within 15%.

Pharmacokinetic data

Baseline assessment was performed within 2 weeks
before gefitinib treatment, including medical history,
physical examination, hematology and biochemistry test,
chest CT and brain MRI. Chest CT scan and brain MRI were
performed 30 days after gefitinib treatment and completion
of WBRT, and then at 2-month intervals before death or loss
to follow-up. Tumor response was evaluated according to
the RECIST version 1.0 [36]. Toxicity evaluation was based
on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCICTC) version 3.0 and assessed monthly.

Efficacy and safety analyses

Gefitinib as primary standard and vandetanib as
internal standard were supplied by AstraZeneca.

Blood and CSF sampling and detection of
gefitinib levels
Plasma and CSF concentrations of gefitinib were
determined by a validated high-performance liquid
chromatographic method (HPLC) with tandem mass
spectrometric detection (LC/MS/MS), as described
previously [35]. Plasma and CSF were isolated by
centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min. Plasma and
CSF analytes were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction
using methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Supernatants were
evaporated to dryness and reconstituted with mobile phase.
The samples were injected onto the liquid chromatography/
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system, chromatographed
with an Inertsil ODS3 column (2.1*150 mm*3 um) at
25°C column temperature, and detected using a PE Sciex
API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a turbo
ionspray source interfaced to an Agilent-1200 HPLC system.
The mobile phase consisted of 0.02 M ammonium acetateacetonitrile (70:30, v/v, pH = 3). The flow rate was set at
0.25 ml/min, and all separations were carried out at 25°C.
The running time of each sample was 6 min. Samples were

Statistical methods
PFS was calculated from the initiation of gefitinib
administration to disease progression or death from
any cause. Time to progression (TTP) was calculated
from the initiation of gefitinib administration to disease
progression. OS was calculated from the initiation of
gefitinib administration to death from any cause. This study
had an 90% power in order to detect a 1% higher in mean
CSF-to-plasma ratio of gefitinib after WBRT compared
with that before WBRT, with Standard deviation 1% and
20% drop rate at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.
(see Supplementary Material File). Two independent
sample t-test was used to determine difference of CSF-toplasma of gefitinib between BM and no BM. Paired sample
t-test were used to determine the gefetinib concentration

The number (single vs. multiple) and size (≤20 mm

permeability of the BBB to gefitinib.

of different durations. The relationships between CSF and
serum concentrations of gefetinib were determined by
linear regression. The survival curves were generated using
the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate analysis of patient
characteristics and tumor responses was conducted by
Pearson chi-square test or the Fisher exact test. Multivariate
analysis was evaluated using a logistic regression model to
predict the clinical response to the treatment regimen. The
following variables were included: gender, age, performance
status, smoking history, number and size of brain metastases,
EGFR mutation status, and extracranial metastases. The Cox
regression method was used to identify the most important
independent prognostic factors and estimate the hazard
ratio. All tests and confidence intervals (CIs) were two sided
and a significance level was 0.05. Statistical analyses were
performed by using SPSS software, Version 13.0.

Efficacy outcomes
Five patients treated with gefitinib and concurrent
WBRT were alive at the time of this analysis, and the median
follow-up time was 15.4 months (range 4.1–28.23 months).
The median PFS and OS were 6.17 and 15.40 months,
respectively. The median TTP for intracranial and lung lesions
were both 7.07 months. Tumor responses of extracranial
lesions and brain metastases were similar (Table 3).
The treatment response and survival analysis of the
15 patients according to the EGFR mutation status were
shown in Table 3. The median PFS and OS in patients with
EGFR mutations were significantly longer, compared with
patients with EGFR wild type (P < 0.05, Figure 4A, 4B). The
median TTP of either brain lesions or primary lung lesions
was significantly longer in EGFR mutant patients (P < 0.05)
(Figure 4C, 4D). In addition, the RR of BM was higher in
patients with EGFR mutant disease than that in patients with
wild-type disease (83.33% vs.11.11%) (Table 4).

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
From October 2009 to March 2011, 19 NSCLC
patients with BM were enrolled, of whom four patients
progressed 30 days after gefitinib treatment, and the
remaining 15 patients received gefitinib with concurrent
WBRT. The baseline characteristics of these 15 patients are
listed in Table 1. All the 15 patients underwent EGFR testing,
finding 6 patients who had EGFR mutations, including 5
exon 19 deletions and 1 exon 21 L858R point mutations.

Toxicity and safety
All 15 patients were included in the toxicity analysis.
The reported adverse events (AEs) are summarized in
Table 5. The most common AEs reported were rash
(53.3%, 8/15) outside the radiation field, acne (33.3%,
5/15), radiation field dermatitis (20%, 3/15), paronychia
(20%, 3/15), pruritus (20%, 3/15), fatigue (26.7%, 4/15),
diarrhea (33.3%, 5/15), and vomiting (20%, 3/15). We
saw no cases of radiation enhancing the gefitinib-related
rash in the portal treatment area. All toxicities were grade
1 or 2. The reported neurotoxicities during the combined
treatment were headache (20%), dizziness (6.7%), memory
impairment (6.7%), and hydrocephalus (6.7%). We saw no
cases of leukoencephalopathy and cognitive disturbance.
No statistically significant differences were found between
gefitinib-WBRT group and the historical WBRT group in
the proportion of patients with evidence of neurotoxicity.
Patients had no treatment related ocular symptoms.

Pharmacokinetic results
Samples from the 13 patients without BM and the
15 patients with BM were collected and analyzed.
The plasma concentrations of gefitinib were similar
between patients with and without BM. Both the mean
CSF concentration of gefitinib and the CSF-to-plasma ratio
of gefitinib in patients with BM were significantly higher
than those in patients without BM (Table 2, P < 0.001).
A good correlation (R2 = 0.57) between plasma and CSF
concentrations of gefitinib in 15 patients with BM before
WBRT was demonstrated (P = 0.001, Figure 2A). Similarly,
a good correlation (R2=0.70) between plasma and CSF
concentrations of gefitinib was demonstrated in 13 patients
without BM (P = 0.004, Figure 2B). The CSF concentration
of gefitinib and the CSF-to-plasma ratio increased with
escalation of the WBRT dose (Figure 3A, 3B). The mean CSF
concentration of gefitinib at 30 and 40 Gy was statistically
higher than that at 0 Gy. The CSF-to-plasma ratio of gefitinib
reached the peak (1.87 ± 0.72%) at 30 Gy, which was
significantly higher than 1.34 ± 0.49% at 0 Gy (P = 0.01).
Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the addition of WBRT
enhanced gefitinib’s ability of penetration in CSF.
The mean CSF concentration of gefitinib at 20–40
Gy (4.85–5.82 ng/ml) reached IC50 (4.46–8.9 ng/mL /10–
20 nM/L) for EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines [37].

DISCUSSION
Brain metastases are associated with poor prognosis,
for which there is no effective treatment at present. WBRT
is a standard treatment for BM. The low CSF penetration
of chemotherapeutic drugs remains a significant factor
contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes for BM patients.
Small-molecular-weight (446.9 daltons) gefitinib may
have the ability to penetrate the BBB [5, 21–22]. Some
studies [21] reported that BM and WBRT could disrupt the

BBB. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of WBRT
on gefitinib permeability across the BBB has not been
previously reported. The major objective of our study was
to evaluate whether WBRT could affect BBB permeability
of gefitinib in BM patients.
For years, brain metastasis has been considered
to increase the permeability of the BBB [38]. Our study
presented evidence that gefitinib could only reach a rather
low level in patients without BM, with a CSF-to-plasma
gefitinib ratio about 0.36% ± 0.18%. Our study showed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that CSF level of gefitinib was 4.15 ng/ml and the CSF-toplasma ratio of gefitinib before WBRT was only 1.34%,
which is similar to that reported in other studies [22–24,
39]. The CSF-to-plasma gefitinib ratio in patients with BM
before WBRT was significantly higher than that in patients
without BM. Although BM could disrupt the BBB, the
CSF penetration ability of gefitinib remains low.
WBRT can disrupt the BBB. d’Avella et al [30,
32] reported that WBRT (40 Gy/20 F) induced changes
in BBB function with the significant increase of transport

of 14C-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid across the BBB in the
cerebral cortex 15 days after WBRT. Qin et al [6, 33]
observed that radiotherapy enhanced the destruction of
the BBB and the degree of the destructive effect on the
BBB in the irradiated normal area directly proportional
to the radiation dose, and the ratio of MTX concentration
in blood and CSF increased by 1.43 fold after 40 Gy
WBRT. Some studies [33–34] reported that brain radiation
could increase the penetration of anticancer drugs such
as irinotecan and cisplatin into the CSF. However, there
are no current data to support the effect of WBRT on
gefitinib permeability across the BBB in patients with BM
from advanced NSCLC. Our study also showed that the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CSF-to-plasma ratio of gefitinib increased with the
increased dose of WBRT and reached the peak (1.87 ±
0.72%) at 30 Gy, which is significantly higher than 1.34
± 0.49% at 0 Gy (P = 0.01). In addition, Gow et al [40]
reported that the administration of EGFR TKI during
WBRT conferred radiosensitivity in brain metastasis of
lung adenocarcinoma. WBRT may enhance the efficacy
of gefitinib for BM patients.
The mean CSF concentration of gefitinib at 20–40
Gy was 4.85–5.82 ng/mL, reaching the IC50 of gefitinib
in vitro of EGFR-mutant cell lines [37]. This may explain
the high disease control of brain lesions (RR 83.33%; DCR
100%) in EGFR mutant patients with BM. Therefore,

BM patients with EGFR mutations could benefit more
from gefitinib. In addition, we also found that the CSF
concentration of gefitinib was well correlated with its
plasma concentration. Some studies [22, 41] reported that
administration of high-dose EGFR-TKIs could achieve a
higher CSF concentration and clinical efficacy as compared
with standard dosing. One study [22] reported that the CSF
concentration of gefitinib increased with the increased dose
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of gefitinib, ranged from 6.2 to 18 nM at a 500-mg dose,
and reached 42 nM at a 1,000-mg dose in patients with
leptomeningeal metastasis. Clarke et al [41] reported that
patients with NSCLC leptomeningeal metastases treated

strategy to treat central nervous system (CNS) metastases
from NSCLC with EGFR wild-type. Grommes et al [42]
reported that pulsatile erlotinob at approximately 1500 mg
per week was safe and had activity in patients with CNS
diseases from EGFR mutant NSCLC even when systemic
resistance had developed and been confirmed.
Our study showed that penetration of gefitinib into
CSF was facilitated under the condition of BM- and WBRTinduced BBB disruption, which supports the beneficial effect
of using gefitinib with concurrent WBRT in patients with
BM. However, previous studies on the efficacy of EGFRTKIs with concurrent WBRT have yielded conflicting results.
Pesce et al [43] reported that the median OS in their 16
patients with BM treated with gefitinib and concurrent WBRT
was 6.3 months, showing no clinical benefit compared with
historical controls receiving gefitinib alone [12, 14, 17, 44].
Welsh et al [19] reported that in their 40 patients treated with
erlotinib plus WBRT, the median OS for those with EGFR
wild type and EGFR mutations were 9.3 and 19.1 months,
respectively. Despite clinically significant findings, it still
has some limitations. The relatively small number of patients
recruited should be considered when interpreting the results.
In addition, EGFR status was confirmed using samples from
lung lesions and not with intracranial lesions. Further studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are needed to confirm the clinical benefit of EGFR-TKIs and
concurrent WBRT in patients with BM.
Pharmacokinetically, our study supports the
combination of EGFR-TKIs with concurrent WBRT in
treating patients with BM, especially for patients with
activating EGFR mutations. Further studies could be made
to compare concurrent and sequential therapy of gefitinib
and WBRT. It remains unknown whether EGFR-TKI
with concurrent WBRT is superior to EGFR-TKI alone in
NSCLC with BM, especially for patients with activating
EGFR mutations. In addition, CSF level of gefitinib may
not be the same as that in patients with brain lesions, and
disruption of the BBB in BM may be more severe than
that in the surrounding tissues. It seems more reasonable
to study the drug concentration within the brain tumor in
study of CNS pharmacokinetics of anticancer therapies.
