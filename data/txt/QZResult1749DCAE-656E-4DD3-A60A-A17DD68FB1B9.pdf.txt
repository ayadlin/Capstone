Abstract
Germline mutations in BRCA1 predispose carriers to a high incidence of breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1
functions to maintain genomic stability through critical roles in DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, and transcriptional control. A major question has been why BRCA1 loss or mutation leads to tumors mainly in
estrogen-regulated tissues, given that BRCA1 has essential functions in all cell types. Here, we report that
estrogen and estrogen metabolites can cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in estrogen receptora–negative breast cells and that BRCA1 is required to repair these DSBs to prevent metabolite-induced
genomic instability. We found that BRCA1 also regulates estrogen metabolism and metabolite-mediated DNA
damage by repressing the transcription of estrogen-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP1A1, in breast cells.
Finally, we used a knock-in human cell model with a heterozygous BRCA1 pathogenic mutation to show how
BRCA1 haploinsufﬁciency affects these processes. Our ﬁndings provide pivotal new insights into why BRCA1
mutation drives the formation of tumors in estrogen-regulated tissues, despite the general role of BRCA1 in
DNA repair in all cell types. Cancer Res; 74(10); 2773–84. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor protein that functions to
preserve genomic stability by regulating key cellular processes,
including homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA
repair, cell-cycle checkpoint control, transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and postreplicative repair (1–3).
Despite playing a role in processes essential to all cells, BRCA1
mutation predisposes to tumors predominantly in estrogenregulated tissues, such as the breasts and ovaries. Indeed,
germline mutations in a single BRCA1 allele confer a lifetime
risk of up to 90% of developing breast cancer and 30% to 40% of
ovarian cancer (4, 5).

Several observations suggest that estrogen has an important
role in the development of BRCA1-dependent breast cancer.
Pre- or postmenopausal oophorectomy in BRCA1 mutation
carriers signiﬁcantly reduces the risk of breast cancer onset
and recurrence (6–8). Furthermore, pregnancy increases the
risk of early-onset breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers, in
contrast with noncarriers for whom pregnancy is protective
(9). It has also been reported that BRCA1 represses the expression of CYP19A1 (aromatase), which converts androgens to
bioactive estrogens (10). Thus BRCA1 loss may increase CYP19
expression and subsequent estrogen production, further driving tumorigenesis (11).
Estrogen is postulated to promote tumorigenesis directly
through stimulation of the estrogen receptor-a (ER-a) and the
downstream activation of promitogenic transcriptional programs. However, this is confounded by observations that
approximately 70% to 80% of BRCA1-mutated breast tumors
are ER-a negative (12, 13). Furthermore, BRCA1 drives ER-a
expression, suggesting the role of estrogen in BRCA1-dependent tumor, development may be independent of ER-a (14).
Consistent with this, estradiol (E2; the predominant estrogen)
induces tumor formation in ER-a knockout mice (15). In these
mice, reduction of endogenous E2, by either oophorectomy or
treatment with aromatase inhibitors, delayed tumorigenesis,
whereas the ER-a antagonist fulvestrant had no effect (15).
The endogenous conversion of estrogen to genotoxic metabolites has been reported as an alternative, potentially ER-a
independent mechanism for estrogen-dependent breast tumorigenesis. Estrogen is hydroxylated to form the catechol estrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE1(E2)) and 4-hydroxyestradiol

(4-OHE1(E2)), a process that is catalyzed by a number of
cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes, including CYP1A1, CYP1A2,
CYP1B1, and CYP3A4. The catechol estrogens are further
oxidized (by the same enzymes) into semiquinone and quinone
forms, the latter of which can react with DNA to form adducts.
Interestingly, urinary levels of 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 are elevated
in patients with breast cancer compared with healthy controls
(16), and 4-OHE2 concentrations have been reported to be up to
three times higher in breast cancer biopsies compared with
normal breast tissue (17). Moreover, in vivo studies have demonstrated that exogenous 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 can induce
kidney and uterine cancers in mice (18, 19). The DNA adducts
induced by these metabolites produce apurinic sites in the DNA
that require repair, error-prone repair of which can lead to A-T
to G-C mutations in DNA in the form of G.T heteroduplexes (20–
22). Furthermore, high levels of depurinated estrogen adducts
have been observed in serum and urine samples from patients
with breast cancer and women with a strong family history of
breast cancer (23, 24). It has been suggested that these depurinating adducts are repaired through the nucleotide excision
repair (NER) and base excision repair pathways; however, a
study that examined chromosomal aberrations in DT40 cells
after treatment with 4-OHE2 observed no difference between
wild-type cells and cells depleted of XPA, a key protein in NER
(25, 26). In contrast, there were enhanced chromosomal breaks
following 4-OHE2 treatment of rad54- and ku70-mutant DT40
cells, both of which are required for repair of double-strand
breaks (DSB) by HR and non-homologous end joining, respectively. This suggests that estrogen metabolites may produce
DNA DSBs.
The idea that estrogen metabolites may cause DNA DSBs,
coupled with the role of BRCA1 in DSB repair, lead us to
hypothesize that BRCA1-deﬁcient cells may be more susceptible to estrogen metabolite-induced DNA damage and subsequent genomic instability. We therefore examined whether
estrogen and its metabolites 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 can cause
DSBs in human breast cells and examined the role of BRCA1 in
both the induction and repair of estrogen metabolite-induced
DNA damage.

Estrogen-Induced Genomic Instability in BRCA1-Deﬁcient Cells

Results
Estrogen metabolites induce DNA DSBs in breast cells
To determine whether estrogen metabolites can generate
DNA DSBs, we ﬁrst assessed whether the parent hormone, E2,
induces DSBs in breast cells. Normal like, ER-a–negative

MCF10A breast cells were treated with either E2 or mock
treated for 3 hours and stained with the DSB markers 53BP1
and gH2AX. Treatment with E2 resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in 53BP1 and gH2AX foci, respectively, compared
with controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 1A and B). To investigate whether

estrogen metabolites cause DSBs, we treated MCF10A cells
with the metabolic intermediates 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 for
3 hours and stained with 53BP1 and gH2AX. Similar to E2
treatment, we found that both metabolites induced a signiﬁcant increase in DSB foci (P < 0.01; Fig. 1C and D). These ﬁndings
were also conﬁrmed in the ER-a–positive breast cancer cell
line, MCF7, indicating that E2 metabolite-induced DSB induction is independent of ER-a (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
To further conﬁrm that 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 induce DSBs, we
performed neutral comet assays. Indeed, MCF10A cells treated
with 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 demonstrated a greater percentage of
tail DNA, tail moment, and tail length, indicative of increased
DSBs (Fig. 1E and F and Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D).
DNA DSBs are known to result in activation of the ATM
kinase, which is activated through autophosphorylation of
ATM at serine-1981. In keeping with this, 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2
treatment resulted in a 2.27-fold and 3.37-fold increase in
ATMpSer1981 foci (colocalized with 53BP1 foci) compared with
mock controls (Supplementary Fig. S1E and S1F). Taken
together, these data suggest that 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 induce
DNA DSBs in breast cells.
Interestingly, when carrying out these experiments, we
consistently observed uneven distribution of estrogen metabolite-induced DSBs and rather than all cells containing slightly
more foci than mock-treated cells, we consistently observed
that a fraction of cells ( 25%–30%) incurred a greater number
of DNA DSBs following 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment. For
example, in cells treated with 2-OHE2, 23% had no 53BP1 foci,
whereas 26% of cells had six or more foci (Fig. 1G). This
suggested that estrogen metabolite-mediated DNA damage
may be affected by cell-cycle distribution. To test this, we
costained 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2-treated MCF10A cells with
gH2AX and cyclin A, which is speciﬁcally expressed during S
and G2 phases of the cell cycle. We found that the vast majority
of estrogen metabolite-mediated DNA damage occurred in
cyclin A-positive cells, suggesting that 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2
speciﬁcally induce DNA damage during S–G2 phase cells (Fig.
1H and I). To conﬁrm this, MCF10A cells treated with 2-OHE2
and 4-OHE2 were pulse labeled with 5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine,
which is incorporated into DNA during replication. Cells were
then costained for gH2AX and EdU. Indeed, signiﬁcantly more
gH2AX foci were observed in EdU-positive cells compared with
EdU-negative cells following estrogen metabolite treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S1G and S1H). This suggests that the DNA
DSBs produced by 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment occur speciﬁcally during S phase.
Estrogen metabolite-mediated DNA damage is
exacerbated by BRCA1 loss and not efﬁciently repaired in
BRCA1-deﬁcient cells
BRCA1 is known to play a pivotal role in DNA DSB repair. In
addition, a role for BRCA1 in the postreplicative repair of bulky
DNA adducts induced by UV, which are structurally similar to
E2 metabolite adducted bases, has been recently described (3).
In light of this, we examined whether BRCA1 was required for
the repair of estrogen-induced DSBs. Endogenous BRCA1
expression was depleted using two independent siRNAs
(siBRCA1) compared with a nontargeting scrambled siRNA

2776

(siSCR) and the cells treated with 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 for 3
hours. Cells were then allowed to recover for 24 hours following
treatment, before being ﬁxed and stained for 53BP1 and gH2AX
(Fig. 2A–C and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). No significant difference in 53BP1 and gH2AX foci number was
observed in siSCR cells treated with 2-OHE2 or 4-OHE2 relative
to untreated control cells, suggesting that DSBs generated
during estrogen metabolite treatment had been efﬁciently
repaired. In contrast, signiﬁcantly more 53BP1 and gH2AX
foci remained in BRCA1-depleted cells treated with 2-OHE2
and 4-OHE2 compared with controls (P < 0.001), indicating that
BRCA1 is required for efﬁcient repair of E2 metabolite-induced
DSBs. This was visualized at multiple time points following
3 hours of 2-OHE2 or 4-OHE2 treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2C and S2D). In addition, given that E2-metabolites induce
DNA damage during S phase, taken together with the known
role for BRCA1 in the postreplicative repair of bulky DNA
adducts, we assessed whether depletion of BRCA1, using two
independent siRNAs, caused replication fork stalling, marked
by residual pS4/8 RPA32 foci (3). Consistent with a role for
BRCA1 in repairing E2-metabolite-induced DNA damage in S
phase cells, we observed a dramatic increase in pS4/8 RPA32positive cells upon BRCA1 depletion following 2OHE2 and
4OHE2 treatment (Fig. 2D).
We next examined whether 2-OHE2 and 4OHE2 treatment
also induced chromosomal instability in BRCA1-depleted cells.
We assessed chromosomal aberrations in control and BRCA1depleted MCF10A cells 24 hours following treatment with
2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2. Structural rearrangements were visualized and quantiﬁed in metaphase spreads using chromosome 1
and 2 FISH staining (Fig. 2E and F). BRCA1 depletion resulted
in a marked increase in chromosomal aberrations following
both 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment, demonstrating that E2
metabolite treatment induces genomic instability in BRCA1deﬁcient cells. Intriguingly, when we examined DSB production in these cells immediately following 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2
treatment (3 hours), we found that 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in 53BP1 and gH2AX foci
in BRCA1-depleted cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2G
and H and Supplementary Fig. S2E). In addition, similar to that
demonstrated earlier, E2 metabolite-mediated DNA damage
occurred speciﬁcally in S–G2 phase of the cell cycle in BRCA1depleted cells (Supplementary Fig. S2F). Because of the relatively short treatment time (3 hours), it is unlikely that this
increase in DSBs observed in BRCA1-depleted cells is solely due
to defective DNA repair. To conﬁrm that this occurred at early
time points and was not confounded by the dose and/or time
points of E2-metabolite treatment used, we assessed gH2AX
marked DNA damage in control and BRCA1-depleted cells
following treatment with 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, and 1 mmol/L
E2, 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 at various time points (Supplementary
Fig. S3A–S3C). This revealed increased DNA damage in BRCA1depleted cells at all doses and treatment time points assessed.
Taken together, these data indicate that loss of BRCA1
expression results in delayed repair kinetics but also increased
levels of DNA damage following treatment with E2 metabolites.
To further conﬁrm this, we examined induction and repair of
DNA DSBs following 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment in BRCA1-

increased DNA damage induction at short time points (3 hours)

in the BRCA1-deﬁcient cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Similarly, defective repair of 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2-induced DSBs
was observed in BRCA1-deﬁcient cells in comparison with
BRCA1 reconstituted cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C).

Given that BRCA2 is also involved in HR-mediated DSB
repair and mutations in this gene also predispose to tumors in
the breast and ovaries, we examined the effect of BRCA2
depletion on 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2-induced DNA damage in
both MCF10A and MCF7 cells. Intriguingly, BRCA2 depletion
resulted in slightly increased DSBs following treatment with 2OHE2 and 4-OHE2 for 3 hours, which seemed to remain
unrepaired at 24 hours following recovery from 2-OHE2 and
4-OHE2 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5). Nevertheless, the
increased level of DNA damage observed following treatment
with 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 in BRCA2-depleted cells was minimal
in comparison with that observed in BRCA1-depleted cells. In
addition, the defective repair of these DSBs in BRCA2-depleted
cells is consistent with BRCA2's role in HR-mediated DSB
repair.
BRCA1 regulates the expression of estrogenmetabolizing enzymes
We have previously proposed that BRCA1 may transcriptionally repress the expression of estrogen metabolizing genes.
Speciﬁcally, we have demonstrated that CYP1A1, the enzyme
responsible for conversion of E2 to 2-OHE2 and semiquinone/
quinone metabolites, is repressed by BRCA1 in a number of
breast cancer cell lines (32). In addition, BRCA1 has been found
to transcriptionally activate a number of detoxiﬁcation/antioxidant genes, including NAD(P)H quinone oxoreductase 1
(NQO1), which reduces genotoxic quinones to nonreactive
hydroquinones (33). This led us to hypothesize that the exacerbated DNA damage observed in BRCA1-depleted cells at
short time points following 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment may
be due to, at least in part, increased estrogen metabolism in
these cells, mediated by upregulated expression of estrogenmetabolizing enzymes, and/or downregulated expression of
detoxiﬁcation enzymes such as NQO1. To assess this, we
examined the expression of a panel of estrogen-metabolizing
and detoxiﬁcation genes, including CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP1A2,
CYP3A4, NQO1, and COMT, using qRT-PCR, in MCF10A and
MCF7 cells transfected with control and BRCA1-depleting
siRNAs (Fig. 3A and B). This revealed that CYP1A1 and CYP3A4
are consistently upregulated upon BRCA1 loss, suggesting that
BRCA1 represses the expression of these genes. In addition,
NQO1 was consistently downregulated upon BRCA1 depletion
in both cell lines. We also examined the expression of these
genes in BRCA1-mutant MDA-MB-436 cells, stably transfected
with EV or BRCA1 Fig. 3C). Ectopic expression of BRCA1 in
these cells repressed expression of CYP1A1, but had a limited
effect on CYP3A4 and NQO1 expression.
To assess whether BRCA1 regulates the transcription of
these genes directly, we performed BRCA1 ChIP-qPCR assays
from MCF10A cells, using primers speciﬁc to the promoter
regions of CYP1A1, CYP3A4, NQO1, and COMT as a negative
control (Fig. 3D). We observed enrichment of BRCA1 at all of
these promoters with the exception of COMT, which is neither
transcriptionally regulated by BRCA1 nor promoter bound by
BRCA1.
To conﬁrm that this occurs in BRCA1-deﬁcient tumors, we
assessed the levels of CYP1A1, the most highly deregulated
gene upon BRCA1 loss, using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in

2778

Cancer Res; 74(10) May 15, 2014

a panel of 21 BRCA1-mutant and 75 BRCA1 wild-type breast
tumors. Intratumoral CYP1A1 expression was scored by a
pathologist and an independent scorer as very weak/absent
¼ 1, moderate ¼ 2, or strong ¼ 3 (Fig. 3E and F). This revealed
that the mean expression of CYP1A1 expression is signiﬁcantly
upregulated in this cohort of BRCA1-mutant tumors compared
with BRCA1 wild-type sporadic tumors (P ¼ 0.0007).
Given that we observed a slight increase in E2 metaboliteinduced DNA damage in BRCA2-depleted cells treated with 2OHE2 and 4-OHE2, we also assessed the role of BRCA2 in
regulating the expression of CYP1A1 in both MCF10A and
MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). This revealed no
signiﬁcant difference in CYP1A1 expression between control
and BRCA2-depleted cells.
BRCA1 suppresses estrogen metabolite-mediated DNA
damage by suppressing estrogen metabolism
As BRCA1 depletion results in increased levels of CYP1A1
and CYP3A4 enzymes and decreased NQO1 expression, we
hypothesized that the levels of 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 and 2,3/3,4
quinone products would be increased in BRCA1-depleted cells
compared with control cells following E2 treatment. Quinone
and semiquinone metabolites are extremely unstable and have
a very limited half-life making them difﬁcult to quantify. In
contrast, 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 (which are generated by CYP1A1
and CYP3A4 in breast cells) are relatively stable. We therefore
developed an UPLC/MS-MS method for the detection of 2OHE2 and 4-OHE2. The method was optimized for baseline
chromatographic separation and the accurate identiﬁcation
and quantiﬁcation of both isomeric forms of the hydroxylestradiol metabolite (Fig. 4A). Using this method, we found that
the relative concentration of 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 was significantly higher in BRCA1-depleted cells compared with control
cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 4B).
As CYP1A1 was the most robustly upregulated estrogenmetabolizing gene upon BRCA1 depletion, we sought to
examine the role of this enzyme in estrogen-dependent DNA
damage. To investigate this, BRCA1 and CYP1A1 were codepleted in MCF10A cells and DNA DSBs assessed 3 hours
following treatment with E2 (Fig. 4C and D). BRCA1 and
CYP1A1 depletion was assessed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary
Fig. S6C and S6D). Strikingly, CYP1A1 depletion lead to a
marked reduction in estrogen-mediated DSBs in BRCA1depleted cells (P < 0.001), suggesting that estrogen-mediated
DNA damage in BRCA1-depleted cells is, at least in part, due to
increased CYP1A1 levels in these cells.
This suggests that BRCA1, apart from mediating repair of E2
metabolite-mediated DNA damage, transcriptionally regulates
estrogen-metabolizing enzymes and subsequently represses
estrogen metabolism, thereby protecting cells against estrogen-induced DNA damage. This is particularly important in
breast and ovarian cells, which are exposed to much higher
levels of estrogen than other tissues within the body (34).
Nevertheless, to conﬁrm whether this mechanism may drive
genomic instability in nonbreast cells, we assessed E2 metabolite-induced DNA damage in HEK293, kidney cells (Supplementary Fig. S6E and S6F). This revealed that, although 2-OHE2
and 4-OHE2 are capable of inducing DNA DSBs in these cells,

they induce much lower levels of DSBs in comparison with
breast cells. In addition, 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment (3
hours) did not induce increased levels of DSBs in BRCA1depleted cells (Supplementary Fig. S6E). Moreover, we
observed similar low levels of DNA damage in both BRCA1and BRCA2-depleted cells. In contrast, consistent with the role
of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DSB repair, both BRCA1 and BRCA2
were required for repair of E2 metabolite-induced DNA damage
in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S6F). Given that much lower
levels of DNA damage were observed in these cells and that we
did not observe any increased DNA damage in BRCA1-depleted
cells in comparison with control, or BRCA2-depleted cells, we
hypothesized that BRCA1 may not regulate the expression of
CYP1A1 in these cells. Intriguingly, we were unable to detect
any CYP1A1 transcript in these cells, suggesting that these cells
may not metabolize estrogen at the same rate as breast cells
(data not shown).

Estrogen metabolite-mediated DNA DSBs are
exacerbated in BRCA1 heterozygous breast cells
Taken together, our data suggest that in BRCA1-deﬁcient
breast cells, deregulated estrogen metabolism results in
increased levels of genotoxic metabolites resulting in increased
DNA damage, which, coupled with defective DNA repair, leads
to genomic instability, a key hallmark of cancer initiation and
progression. However, clinical evidence suggests a direct role
for estrogen in breast cancer development in BRCA1 mutation
carriers, suggesting that heterozygous loss of BRCA1 may
result in haploinsufﬁciency in at least one of BRCA1's functions. Indeed, a number of studies have reported increased
sensitivity to ionizing radiation in BRCA1 carrier/heterozygous
cells, suggesting that DNA DSB repair may be impaired in
carriers (35). In addition, a recent study by Konishi and
colleagues, using somatic cell gene targeting to introduce the
common pathogenic BRCA1 mutation 185delAG into a single

Estrogen-Induced Genomic Instability in BRCA1-Deﬁcient Cells

BRCA1 allele in MCF10A cells, demonstrated that this heterozygous BRCA1 mutation confers impaired HR-mediated DSB
repair, hypersensitivity to genotoxic stress, and increased
genomic instability (27). We therefore set out to determine
whether heterozygous mutation of BRCA1 affects estrogen
metabolite-mediated DNA damage and estrogen metabolism.
Using the same cell line model developed by Konishi and
colleagues, heterozygous BRCA1 185delAG (BRCA1þ/) and
control (BRCA1þ/þ) MCF10A cells were treated with 2-OHE2
and 4-OHE2 for 3 hours and the media replaced with normal
media for 24 hours, before ﬁxing and staining for 53BP1 and
gH2AX. Consistent with a defect in BRCA1 function, a significant number of unresolved DNA damage foci were visible in 2OHE2- and 4-OHE2-treated BRCA1þ/ cells in comparison with
control BRCA1þ/þcells (P < 0.001; Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, the level
of unrepaired DNA DSBs was similar to that observed in BRCA1depleted MCF10A cells, suggesting that BRCA1 haploinsufﬁciency imparts a major defect in repair of E2 metabolitemediated DNA damage. We next examined whether estrogen
metabolites generate more DSBs in BRCA1þ/ cells. Indeed,
although short-term (3 hours) 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment
induced DNA damage in BRCA1þ/þ cells, signiﬁcantly more
DNA DSB foci were observed in BRCA1þ/ cells (P < 0.01; Fig.
5B). In support of this, we treated normal primary breast
progenitor cells, isolated from breast tissue obtained from a
woman undergoing elective breast reduction, as well as
BRCA1þ/ primary breast progenitor cells from a BRCA1 mutation carrier undergoing a risk-reducing mastectomy, with both
2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 and examined both DNA damage induction
at 3 hours posttreatment, as well as their ability to repair E2
metabolite-induced DNA damage 24 hours following treatment
with 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2. In keeping with our previous ﬁndings,
2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment for 3 hours induced more DNA
damage in the BRCA1þ/ mammary progenitor cells compared
with the BRCA1 wild-type cells and this DNA damage was not
repaired as efﬁciently in the BRCA1þ/ cells compared with the
BRCA1 wild-type cells (Fig. 5C and D). Taken together these
data suggest that like BRCA1-depleted cells, BRCA1þ/ cells
may have increased rates of estrogen metabolism as well as
defective repair of E2 metabolite-induced DNA damage.
To examine this, we assessed the expression levels of the same
panel of estrogen metabolizing and detoxiﬁcation enzymes in
BRCA1þ/þ and BRCA1þ/ cells. Indeed, as in BRCA1-depleted
cells, CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 were upregulated in BRCA1þ/
compared with BRCA1þ/þ cells (Fig. 5E). Intriguingly, NQO1
expression was maintained at similar levels in both cells lines,
suggesting that BRCA1 haploinsufﬁciency does not negatively
impact all BRCA1-regulated transcriptional targets. Finally,
consistent with the defective DSB repair observed in these cells
following 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment, we found that treatment with either of these metabolites induced genomic instability in BRCA1þ/ cells but not BRCA1þ/þ cells (Fig. 5F).

Discussion
One of the most perplexing features of BRCA1 biology is that
despite playing a central role in the DNA damage response and
DSB repair pathways in all cells, mutation carriers predominantly

www.aacrjournals.org

develop tumors in the breast and ovaries; both estrogen-driven
tissues exposed to high levels of estrogen. Here, we show that
treatment with both E2 and the E2 metabolites 2-OHE2 and 4OHE2, induces DNA DSBs in human breast cancer cells in an ERa independent manner. We also found that E2 metabolitemediated DSBs occur speciﬁcally in S phase cells, suggesting
that induction of these lesions is coupled to DNA replication. We
hypothesize that E2 metabolite adducted DNA bases represent
replication barriers, which lead to replication fork stalling during
DNA synthesis. Indeed, a number of studies have shown that 4hydroxyequilenin (4-OHEN), a metabolite of the equine estrogen
equilenin (which is almost identical to 4OHE-2 in humans),
causes identical DNA adducts to those caused by 4-OHE2 and
that these adducts cause replication fork stalling (36, 37).
In general, stalled replication forks do not collapse and form
DSBs, but are instead stabilized by the ATR kinase through the
signaling and recruitment of a plethora of checkpoint signaling
and repair proteins, resulting in resolution of the stalled fork
through a HR-mediated repair process involving BRCA1. However, recent studies have shown that E2 inhibits ATR signaling,
suggesting that E2 and its metabolites may lead to replication
fork stalling and subsequent fork collapse and DSB formation
through the combined effect of replication fork stalling and
ATR inhibition (38). Further to this, BRCA1 has been shown to
be required for both resolution of stalled replication forks as
well as HR-mediated repair of DSBs caused following stalled
fork collapse (39). BRCA1 is also required for the removal and
repair of bulky base adducts, a mechanism through which
BRCA1 may suppress adduct-induced mutagenesis (3). Consistent with this, we observed a dramatic increase in pS4/8
RPA32-positive cells, upon BRCA1 depletion in 2OHE2- and
4OHE2-treated cells.
Interestingly, we found that BRCA1 depletion also resulted
in increased levels of E2 metabolite-induced DNA damage, even
at very early time points. This suggested that BRCA1 may also
play a more direct role in regulating the physical levels of DNA
damage induced by estrogen metabolites. Previous data from
our laboratory had indicated that BRCA1 loss leads to upregulation of CYP1A1, a major regulator of E2 metabolism in
breast tissues (32). We therefore tested whether BRCA1 may
also regulate the expression of other estrogen metabolizing
enzymes, thereby regulating the levels of estrogen-derived
metabolites. This analysis revealed that BRCA1 directly
represses the transcription of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 and promotes the expression of the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase,
NQO1. We conﬁrmed, using IHC in a cohort of BRCA1-mutant
and matched BRCA1 wild-type tumors, that CYP1A1, the major
enzyme involved in conversion of E2 to 2-OHE2 in breast
tissues, is signiﬁcantly upregulated in BRCA1-mutant tumors.
This is consistent with the increased levels of both 2-OHE2 and
4-OHE2 observed in BRCA1-depleted cells. We also demonstrated that depletion of CYP1A1 signiﬁcantly reduces the
amount of DNA damage induced in BRCA1-depleted cells
exposed to short-term E2 treatment, conﬁrming that E2-mediated DNA damage in BRCA1-depleted cells is, at least in part,
due to increased estrogen metabolism. Intriguingly, when
examining the impact of BRCA2 on estrogen metaboliteinduced DNA damage, we found that although BRCA2 is

Estrogen-Induced Genomic Instability in BRCA1-Deﬁcient Cells

required for the repair of these breaks, loss of BRCA2 does not
lead to deregulated estrogen metabolism and the associated
increased DNA damage. Perhaps this explains why BRCA2
mutations are less penetrant than BRCA1 mutations in predisposing carriers to breast and ovarian cancers.
We have also demonstrated that 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 treatment leads to increased DSB production in MCF10A cells and
primary breast cells harboring a pathogenic heterozygous
BRCA1 mutation, and that like BRCA1-depleted cells, these
cells are unable to repair E2 metabolite-mediated DNA damage, leading to increased genomic instability. Importantly, we
found that BRCA1 heterozygous mutant cells also have upregulated levels of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4, suggesting that increased estrogen metabolism may contribute to E2-mediated
DNA damage in these cells. Consistent with this, higher levels
of urinary excreted 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 have been observed in
BRCA1 carriers compared with healthy control women with no
BRCA1 mutation (40).
Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that exposure to
estrogen and its subsequent metabolism in BRCA1-deﬁcient
breast cells is capable of driving genomic instability, a welldeﬁned early event in breast cancer development. Given that
estrogen levels in normal/benign breast tissue are known to be
six to seven times that of circulating estrogen levels, our
ﬁndings suggest a mechanism through which BRCA1 carriers,
through enhanced production of DNA-damaging estrogen
metabolites, may acquire the genetic alterations that initiate
neoplastic transformation in breast tissue (34). Similarly, levels
of estrogen in ovarian tissues greatly exceed that of circulating
estrogen, suggesting that this model may also explain the
substantially increased risk of ovarian cancer in BRCA1 carriers
(41).
A phase III trial termed, Prevention of Breast Cancer by
Letrozole in Postmenopausal Women carrying a BRCA1/2
Mutation (LIBER), (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00673335)
is currently enrolling postmenopausal women for treatment
with letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, to evaluate its ability to
prevent the development of breast cancer in patients with a
BRCA1/2 mutation. Our results coupled with the ﬁnding that
aromatase levels are substantially higher in prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy tissue from BRCA1 carriers (10),
provides further mechanistic data to support this approach.
However, aromatase inhibitors may have little preventative
effect in premenopausal women, in whom the majority of
BRCA1-linked tumors develop, and in whom estrogen production occurs predominantly in the ovaries through an aroma-

tase-independent biosynthesis pathway. In these women,
oophorectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of breast
cancer by up to 60% (42). Taking our ﬁndings into account, it
may also be worth considering the use of aromatase inhibitors
as an additional chemopreventative strategy in premenopausal
women, who have undergone risk-reducing oophorectomy
without mastectomy.
Finally, in premenopausal women who have opted not to
undergo risk-reducing oophorectomy or mastectomy, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists, may prove useful
as chemopreventative agents. These drugs cause reversible
ovarian suppression/ablation and are currently used in combination with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of premenopausal women with ER-a–positive breast
cancer (43, 44).
