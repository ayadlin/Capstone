ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) express high levels of drug efflux transporters and
antioxidant genes, and are therefore believed to be responsible for cancer recurrence
following chemo/radiotherapy intervention. In this study, we investigated the role
of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a master regulator of antioxidant gene expression,
in the growth and stress resistance of CSC-enriched mammosphere. The MCF7
mammospheres expressed significantly higher levels of the NRF2 protein and target
gene expression compared to the monolayer. As underlying mechanisms, we observed
that proteolytic activity and expression of the proteasome catalytic subunits were
decreased in the mammospheres. Additionally, mammospheres retained a high level
of p62 and the silencing of p62 was observed to attenuate NRF2 activation. NRF2
increase was confirmed in sphere-cultures of the colon and ovarian cancer cells. The
functional implication of NRF2 was demonstrated in NRF2-knockdown mammospheres.
NRF2-silenced mammospheres demonstrated increased cell death and retarded
sphere growth as a result of target gene repression. Moreover, unlike the control
mammospheres, NRF2-knockdown mammospheres did not develop anticancer drug
resistance. Collectively, these results indicated that altered proteasome function and
p62 expression caused NRF2 activation in CSC-enriched mammospheres. In addition,
NRF2 appeared to play a role in CSC survival and anticancer drug resistance.

characteristics. CSCs present reduced levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and higher expression levels of
drug efflux transporters than non-stem cells [9]. These
changes can help in facilitating the extracellular efflux of
anticancer drugs and enhance the protection against ROS
damage, which results in chemo/radioresistance.
Since Reynold et al. [10] reported a neurosphere
culture system using neuronal cells from the striatum of
mouse brain, nonadherent sphere culture has been applied
to assess self-renewal and pluripotency of CSCs in vitro.
In anchorage-independent conditions, normal epithelial
cells cannot survive because the loss of the cell-matrix
interaction triggers anoikis, a form of programmed cell
death [11]. On the other hand, undifferentiated cells such
as stem cells or early progenitor cells can survive and
form spheres in the same conditions [10, 12]. Dontu and
colleagues developed a 3-dimensional nonadherent culture
system using mammary epithelial cells from normal breast
tissues. This system is called a mammosphere culture

INTRODUCTION
The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept was first
introduced in a study by Bonnet et al. [1], which
demonstrated that a subpopulation of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) cells was capable of tumor initiation
in non-obese diabetic mice. Ignatova et al. [2] reported
that the human cortical glial tumors contain tumor stemlike cells. After these reports, CSCs were identified and
characterized in various human tumors, including the
cancers of the brain, breast, and colon [3, 4]. CSCs and
normal stem cells share many properties such as selfrenewal and differentiation capacities. Additionally,
normal stem cells and CSCs are controlled by common
signaling pathways such as Notch-1 and Wnt signaling
for maintenance of the stem cell linage [5, 6]. The
existence of CSCs is considered as the main cause of
tumor relapse after chemo/radiotherapy in the clinic [7, 8].
The resistance can be explained by several molecular

system [13]. They also found that these mammospheres
are enriched in stem and early progenitor cells that can
differentiate into epithelial linages. Similarly, more than
95% of the cells in mammospheres from breast cancer cell
lines and primary breast tumors were CD44-positive and
CD24-negative linages, which indicates that most of the
cells in mammospheres are breast CSCs [14]. Hence, the
mammosphere culture system has been utilized to screen
or test anticancer drugs against breast CSCs along with the
induced pluripotent stem cell [15, 16].
NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a transcription
factor that protects cells against oxidative damage by
up-regulating the expression of various genes encoding
detoxifying/antioxidant proteins, including NAD(P)H
quinine oxidoreductase (NQO-1), heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1), glutathione (GSH) generation enzymes, and
GSH peroxidase (GPx) as well as drug efflux transporters
[17, 18]. Under normal conditions, NRF2 remains inactive
through the formation of a complex with Kelch-like ECHassociated protein 1 (KEAP1), and this complex leads to the
Cullin 3 (CUL3)-based E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination
and proteasome-dependent degradation of NRF2 [19, 20].
Canonical NRF2 activators such as sulforaphane induce the
modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues, leading to the
blockage of KEAP1/CUL3-mediated NRF2 degradation,
and consequent transcription of the antioxidant response
element (ARE)-bearing genes [21, 22]. In addition to this
canonical pathway, several endogenous proteins such
as p62 and p21 could increase NRF2 activity as a noncanonical way [23–25]. Particularly, p62, which is known
as a linker molecule between ubiquitinated proteins and
the autophagy system, was found to bind to specific
residues of KEAP1 and, thereby, induce the dissociation
of the NRF2-KEAP1 complex [24–26]. Although the
essential role of NRF2 in normal cell redox homeostasis
has been firmly established, a number of studies suggest
that a high level of NRF2 in cancer cells results in growth
enhancement and chemoresistance (reviewed by Hayes
et al. [17]). In agreement with these data, our previous
reports demonstrated that NRF2 silencing suppressed
tumor growth and chemoresistance in colon cancer cells
[27] and ovarian cancer cells [28]. Moreover, recent
evidence started to indicate the association of NRF2 with
CSCs function. In neural stem/progenitor cells, NRF2
overexpression enhanced neurospheres formation and
neuronal differentiation [29]. Zhu et al. [30] demonstrated
that NRF2 knockdown in primary human glioblastoma
cells decreased self-renewal capacity of glioma stem cells
(GSCs).
Since NRF2 governs the expression of genes
encoding detoxifying/antioxidant proteins and drug efflux
transporters, it can be hypothesized that chemoresistance
and low ROS levels in CSCs can be mediated by NRF2
signaling. Herein, we investigated the role of NRF2
signaling in CSC survival and resistance by using a
CSC-enriched MCF7 mammosphere culture system.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We observed NRF2 signaling activation in MCF7
mammospheres as well as other type of cancer spheres,
and suggested its underlying molecular mechanisms by
demonstrating the diminished proteasome activity and
elevated p62 level. Finally, NRF2-mediated up-regulation
of detoxifying/antioxidant genes and efflux transporters
was shown to be responsible for enhanced mammosphere
growth and anticancer drug resistance.

RESULTS
Up-regulation of drug transporters and
detoxifying/antioxidant genes in MCF7
mammospheres
In order to establish an experimental system of
tumor sphere formation, the human breast carcinoma
MCF7 cell line was grown in an ultralow attachment
plate with the sphere culture medium for 7 d. Then, the
expression of CSCs markers such as KLF4, NANOG,
and SOX2 was monitored by immunoblot analysis. As
previously reported, protein levels of these CSCs markers
were higher in mammospheres than in monolayer
cultured MCF7 cells (Figure 1A). Specific cell surface
markers are used to characterize CSCs. In breast
CSCs, expression of CD44+/CD24– has been associated
with CSCs characteristics [31]. In our mammosphere
system, the level of the CD44 transcript was 4 times
higher in mammospheres than in the MCF7 monolayer
(Supplementary Figure S1). Additionally, cell population
with expression of CD44+/CD24– was more than 90%
in mammosphere MCF7 (Supplementary Figure S2).
These confirm that MCF7 mammospheres are a CSCsenriched experimental system. Then, we examined
whether MCF7 mammospheres acquired resistance
to the anticancer drug, doxorubicin, and the oxidative
stressor, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When the cells
were incubated with doxorubicin (0.625 and 1.25 μM)
for 24 h, the number of viable cells was higher in the
mammosphere than in the monolayers. Thirty six percent
of cells were viable in monolayers, while 55% were
viable in the mammospheres after 0.625 μM doxorubicin
(Figure 1B). Similarly, MCF7 mammospheres were
relatively more resistant to H2O2 treatment than MCF7
monolayers (Figure 1C). These results confirm that the
MCF7 mammosphere system possesses the core features
of CSCs, including stemness gene expression and
anticancer drug resistance.
Next, the expression of drug transporter genes
was investigated in MCF7 CSCs by real-time reverse
transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Levels of multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs; ABCCs)
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; ABCG2)
were higher in mammospheres. In particular, MRP2 and
MRP3 transcript levels were elevated by 13-fold and
50-fold, respectively, compared to MCF7 monolayers

and 3.8–fold, respectively, in MCF7 mammospheres

when compared to MCF7 monolayers (Figure 1E). Taken
together, these results suggest that efflux transporters and

mammospheres.

Activation of NRF2 signaling in MCF7
mammospheres

(Figure 3A). These results indicate that enhanced NRF2
level in mammospheres is due to protein stabilization.
Nonetheless, there was no significant difference in
KEAP1 levels between monolayers and mammospheres
(Figure 3B). In addition, CUL3 protein level was relatively
higher in mammospheres, which does not support NRF2
stabilization.
Since NRF2 stabilization did not accompany
KEAP1 change in mammospheres, we next determined
ubiquitinated NRF2 levels. Endogenous NRF2 in the
monolayers and mammospheres was immunoprecipitated
with an NRF2 antibody and immunoblotted using an
ubiquitin (Ub) antibody. The results showed that the level
of ubiquitinated NRF2 was higher in the mammospheres
than in the monolayers (Figure 3C). Accumulation
of ubiquitinated NRF2 in mammospheres was also
confirmed by Ub immunoprecipitation followed by
NRF2 immunoblotting (Figure 3D). These data indicate
that NRF2 protein stabilization can be associated with
repressed degradation of ubiquitinated NRF2.

Based on the elevated expression of detoxifying/
antioxidant genes and drug efflux transporters, we
investigated whether the NRF2 signaling pathway
was activated in MCF7 mammospheres. First, western
blot analysis revealed that the level of NRF2 protein
was substantially higher in mammospheres than in the
monolayers. NRF2 protein levels in the total cell lysate
as well as in the nuclear fraction were higher in the
mammospheres (Figure 2A). Accordantly, we observed
that ARE-driven luciferase activity was significantly
enhanced in mammospheres (Figure 2B), indicating that
NRF2 activity increased in the MCF7 mammospheres. In
addition, the level of the NRF2 transcript was 1.8 times
higher in the mammospheres than in the monolayers
(Figure 2C). It is noteworthy that the increase in the
level of NRF2 was sphere culture-specific. When MCF7
mammospheres were dissociated and re-differentiated
in normal adherent plates for 3 d, the level of NRF2
protein in the total cell lysate returned to the level
observed in MCF7 monolayers (Figure 2D). These results
indicate the increase in NRF2 signaling is mammospherespecific. Nonetheless, NRF2 activation could be associated
with particular components in the sphere culture medium,
such as growth factors. In order to exclude this possibility,
we cultured MCF7 cells in a normal adherent plate with
the sphere culture medium for 3 d. In these conditions,
MCF7 did not form spheres (Figure 2E) and, in contrast
to what was observed in the MCF7 mammosphere
cultures, NRF2 and KLF4 protein levels were not elevated
(Figure 2F). This also verified the mammosphere-specific
NRF2 activation. In addition, we could confirm the NRF2
increase in sphere-cultured colon carcinoma HCT116
and ovarian carcinoma A2780: levels of NRF2 protein
along with CSC marker KLF4 were significantly higher in
spheres when compared to corresponding monolayer cells
(Figure 2G). Collectively, these results indicate that NRF2
activation may be involved in the enhanced expression of
efflux transporters and detoxifying/antioxidant genes in
MCF7 mammospheres.

Reduced proteasome function in MCF7
mammospheres
In an attempt to elucidate causative mechanisms of
NRF2 accumulation, proteasome function was assessed
in MCF7 mammospheres. For this, we evaluated the
level of proteasome substrate accumulation using the
pLKO.1-ODCpdd-luciferase plasmid. In this construct,
the proteasome destruction domain (pdd) from ornithine
decarboxylase (ODC) was fused to the luciferasecontaining pLKO.1 plasmid. The plasmid was transfected
in MCF7 to monitor the proteasome function. In
mammospheres, the proteasome sensitive luciferase
activity was significantly high when compared to MCF7
monolayers. The luciferase activity was similar to that
of the MG132-treated monolayer group (Figure 4A),
indicating that proteolytic proteasome activity is reduced
in the mammospheres. Protease activity of the 26S
proteasome is mediated by three catalytic subunits. The
catalytic core subunits of the proteasome are PSMB5,
PSMB6, and PSMB7, presenting chemotrypsin-like,
caspase-like, and trypsin-like peptidase activities,
respectively. When these peptidase activities were
determined using fluorogenic substrates, the proteasome
protease activities were reduced in mammospheres.
In particular, trypsin-like and caspase-like activities
were significantly low in mammospheres compared to
monolayers (Figure 4B). In addition, PSMB5, PSMB6,
and PSMB7 protein levels were consistently reduced
in mammospheres (Figure 4C). These results indicated
that reduced proteasome activity might be responsible
for the enhanced ubiquitinated NRF2 accumulation in
mammospheres.

Stabilization of NRF2 protein in MCF7
mammospheres
In order to elucidate the mechanism involved
in the increase of NRF2 protein in mammospheres, we
monitored NRF2 protein stability in the presence of
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). When
cells were incubated with CHX (10 μg/mL) for 0–80 min,
NRF2 protein levels rapidly diminished with time in
MCF7 monolayers, while NRF2 protein levels did not
show any decrease up to 80 min in MCF7 mammospheres

an increased autophagy activity (Figure 5A). In addition,
both protein and mRNA levels of p62 were increased in the
mammospheres (Figure 5A and 5B). Since p62 can regulate
NRF2 via a non-canonical pathway [25], these data suggest
that altered autophagy activity in mammospheres may be
an additional contributing factor to NRF2 stabilization. To
investigate a potential correlation between p62 and NRF2,
we established the p62-knockdown stable cell line (shp62)
and examined NRF2 expression in mammospheres. Our
established knockdown cells displayed a 52% reduction
in p62 mRNA level when compared to the nonspecific
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sc control cell line (Figure 5C). After mammosphere
formation, the increase in p62 was not observed in shp62
cells, confirming p62 knockdown (Figure 5D). Importantly,
we found that p62 knockdown suppressed NRF2 increase
in mammospheres. NRF2 protein levels in total cell lysates
were not elevated in the p62 knockdown group (Figure 5E).
Accordantly, the increase in AKR1c1 and MRP2 transcript
levels was significantly repressed by p62 knockdown
(Figure 5F). Taken together, these data imply that the
increased p62 level in the mammosphere is also associated
with NRF2 accumulation and consequent activation.

was 86 μm (Figure 6D). Similarly, among 38 spheres in
the microscopic area, the number of mammospheres with
over 100 μm diameter was significantly lower in the NRF2
knockdown MCF7 (Figure 6E). These results indicate that
NRF2 facilitates mammosphere formation and growth.

Thus, it can be hypothesized that NRF2 knockdown also
affects CSC marker expression. To verify this hypothesis,
the levels of KLF4 and NANOG, two CSC markers, were
measured by immunoblot analysis. Unlike our hypothesis,
there were no noticeable differences in KLF4 and NANOG
expression between sc control and shNRF2 mammospheres
(Figure 6F and 6G).

CSC, were decreased in NRF2 knockdown mammospheres
(Figure 8C). Differential transporter increases can lead
to sensitization to anticancer drug treatment. Indeed,
NRF2 knockdown mammospheres accumulated higher
amount of doxorubicin than sc control mammospheres
(Figure 8D). In addition, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis after
a 72 h-doxorubicin incubation revealed that shNRF2
mammospheres did not develop doxorubicin resistance
in contrast to the sc control mammospheres (Figure 8E).
Similarly, the sc control MCF7 acquired 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) resistance after sphere formation, whereas
shNRF2 mammospheres showed a similar response to
5-FU cytotoxicity compared to monolayers (Figure 8F).
Collectively, these data suggested that mammosphere
anticancer resistance, which is one of CSC characteristics,
is largely mediated by NRF2 activation.

Enhanced ROS and cell death in shNRF2
mammospheres
It was apparent that NRF2 stabilization led to
elevated detoxifying/antioxidant gene expression in
mammospheres. This phenomenon may be an underlying
mechanism of delayed mammosphere growth in the
NRF2 knockdown group. Indeed, the increase in AKR1c1,
NQO1, and HO-1 in mammospheres was suppressed by
NRF2 knockdown. AKR1c1 increase in sc mammospheres
was 44-fold higher than monolayers, while the value
in shNRF2 mammospheres was 19-fold increase
(Figure 7A). In addition, mammosphere GSH reductase
(GSR) and ROS detoxifying GPx increases were repressed
in shNRF2 mammospheres (Figure 7B). Similar patterns
were observed in immunoblot analysis using antibodies
against HO-1 and AKR1c1 (Figure 7C). Mammosphere
ARE luciferase activity was also much lower in NRF2
knockdown cells (Figure 7D).
When intracellular ROS level was visualized by
confocal microscopy using a fluorogenic dye carboxy2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA),
shNRF2 mammospheres exhibited a higher level of ROS
than sc mammospheres (Figure 7E). Next, to monitor cell
death in mammospheres, sc and shNRF2 mammospheres
were dissociated into single cells and then stained with
an early apoptosis-specific marker, Annexin V, or a late
apoptosis/necrosis-specific marker, PI. The analysis
revealed that shNRF2 mammospheres retained a greater
number of Annexin V- and PI-positive cells than the
sc control mammospheres (Figure 7F). These results
suggested that a low expression of antioxidant genes could
result in elevated ROS and enhanced cell death in NRF2
knockdown mammospheres, further leading to delayed
mammosphere growth.

DISCUSSION
Mounting evidence showed the correlation between
NRF2 and cancer resistance. In a number of human
tumors and cancer cell lines, NRF2 level increases and
the resulting target gene expression confers cancer cell
protection against the oxidizing microenvironment,
anticancer therapy, and ionizing radiations [17]. CSCs
are highly resistant to the conventional cancer therapies;
therefore the existence of CSC populations in tumors
is considered as the main cause of tumor relapse and
aggressiveness [7, 8]. In the present study, we observed
that NRF2 activity and its target genes expression were
elevated in nonadherent MCF7 mammospheres, which
are considered as a CSCs-enriched system. As underlying
molecular mechanisms, the proteasome function was
reduced and p62 level increased in mammospheres.
NRF2-driven expression of detoxifying/antioxidant genes
and ABC transporters in mammospheres facilitated sphere
growth and anticancer drugs resistance. Notably, NRF2
increase in cultured tumor spheres could be observed
in other type of cells such as colon cancer and ovarian
cancer cells, indicating the universal role of NRF2 in
CSCs-enriched system. These results suggest that NRF2
is implicated in the survival/growth and stress resistance
of breast CSCs.
Increased expression of ABC transporters has been
recognized as a representative characteristic of CSCs
[33, 34]. As a molecular mechanism, the involvement of
several stemness transcription factors in ABC transporters
expression has been demonstrated. In chemoresistant
cancer cells, a stemness transcription factor OCT4
showed a positive correlation with MDR1 and BCRP
expression levels [35]. SOX2 enhanced MRP3 and MRP6
expression in patient-derived GCS, resulting in significant
chemoresistance [36]. We observed that the levels of
NRF2 and ABC transporters were elevated in MCF7
mammospheres, and the ABC transporters increase was

Anticancer drug sensitization of mammospheres
by NRF2 knockdown
Mammosphere chemoresistance can be related
with NRF2 activation and consequent drug efflux. In
NRF2 knockdown mammospheres, the increase in efflux
transporters such as BCRP and MRP2 were significantly
attenuated when compared to the sc control mammospheres
(Figure 8A). Repressed expression of efflux transporters
was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using MRP2
and BCRP antibodies (Figure 8B). Accordingly, Hoechst

significantly affected by NRF2 knockdown, indicating the
role of NRF2 in mammosphere transporter expression. As
the increase in stemness factors such as KLF4, NANOG,
SOX2, and OCT4 was not affected in NRF2 knockdown
mammospheres, NRF2 decrease can be responsible for the
reduced ABC transporters expression. The involvement of
NRF2 in transporter expression has been demonstrated in
various cell types. MRP2 gene induction was observed in
human and mouse hepatoma cells after exposure to NRF2
activators such as butylated hydroxyanisole [37]. The
human BCRP gene promoter presents the ARE sequence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and NRF2 can transactivate BCRP expression in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells [38]. Together with these
reports, our data suggest a novel role of NRF2 in breast
CSCs phenotype by elevating ABC transporters.
Intracellular redox state is one important modulator
in stem cell maintenance and pluripotency. In atm-deficient
mice, ROS level is increased in various organs due to
repressed expression of catalase, superoxide dismutase
(SOD), and GPx. Thus, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
from atm-deficient mice showed decreased reconstitution
capacity with high ROS level [39]. HSCs population with
8178

Oncotarget

low ROS presented higher levels of Notch1 expression
and self-renewal capacity than HSCs with high ROS
[40]. In addition, treatment of high ROS HSCs with an
antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), could recover HSC
function. Based on these, it can be hypothesized that,
similar to HSCs, CSCs in tumors may retain low ROS
levels. Indeed, in the CSC population from primary human
breast cancers, the expression of GSH synthesis enzymes
was significantly higher than in the corresponding nontumorigenic cells [34]. The leukemia stem cell population
expressed higher GPx levels and, thereby, contained lower
ROS level [41]. All together, these results suggest the
importance of the ROS detoxifying system in stem cell
maintenance. Thus, the potential contribution of NRF2
signaling to CSC biology could be an area of interest. We
provided evidence that NRF2 signaling is elevated in CSCsenriched mammospheres and this increase appears to play
a role in ROS reduction and sphere growth enhancement.
Similarly, several recent reports have demonstrated the
increase of NRF2 signaling in CSCs. In alveolar basal
stem cells (ABSCs), dynamic ROS increase could activate
NRF2, which, in turn, stimulates Notch-1 signaling to
enhance self-renewal of ABSCs [42]. A very recent study
by Wu et al. showed that mammospheres have higher
chemoresistance and lower ROS levels than monolayer
cells, and suggested that NRF2 activation can be a cause
[43]. Specifically, this study described that the treatment of
mammospheres with NRF2 inhibitor could control sphere
chemoresistance. On the other hand, Achuthan et al [44]
demonstrated that persistent drug treatment generated stable
colonies with tumor stem cell phenotypes and indicated that
these cells retained low ROS levels and increased NRF2
activity [44]. In addition, this study presented the reduced
proteasome activity and increased p21 as underlying
signaling events in drug-induced tumor stem cells. Together
with these reports, our study strengthens the role of NRF2
in CSC characteristics by using knockdown spheres and
different cancer cell lines. Moreover, we elucidated that the
proteasome dysfunction and p62 elevation are the driving
signaling changes to elevate NRF2 in mammospheres.
The link between the proteasome and CSCs has been
described in several previous reports. A study by Vlashi et al.
showed that proteasome activity is low in breast and glioma
cancer cell line spheres when compared to monolayer
cells [45, 46]. Particularly, they showed that the cancer
cell population with low proteasome activity exhibited an
enhanced sphere forming capacity and increased CSCs
marker expression; therefore they proposed that the low
proteasome activity can be a novel marker of CSCs. As
supportive clinical evidence, proteasome subunit expression
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissues was
negatively correlated with patient survival [47]. These data
suggest that the alteration of proteasome function can have
a specific role in CSCs. For instance, a recent study showed
that the RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 could mediate
proteasome down-regulation and, consequently, Notch-1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is stabilized and CSCs signaling could be enhanced [48].
As additional evidence, our data support the role of
proteasome alteration in CSC phenotypes: the decreased
proteasome function contributed to stress resistance and
growth facilitation of CSC-enriched cancer spheres by
stabilizing NRF2. Since NRF2 activation can be achieved
by the incubation of cells with proteasome inhibitors [49],
accumulated ubiquitinated NRF2 and total NRF2 protein in
mammospheres can activate target gene expression. On the
other hand, there is a report showing a distinct phenomenon.
In a study by Jang et al, NRF2 expression was high in human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and in turn, NRF2 elevated
proteasome activity by increasing the proteasome chaperone
expression [50]. It was concluded that high levels of NRF2
and proteasome contributed to the self-renewal activity of
hESCs; however, activated proteasome appeared to affect
NRF2 level eventually, leading to NRF2 decrease upon
differentiation. Overall, this study showed the involvement
of dynamic interplay between proteasome and NRF2 in
stemness development. Although the status of proteasome
activity is not coherent, these reports support the potential
importance of proteasome and NRF2 in CSCs biology.
One of the novel findings of our study would
be the role of autophagy-associated p62 increase in
mammospheres, and its role in CSCs phenotypes.
Although the proteasome function was reduced, we
found that the total level of ubiquitinated proteins
was not higher in mammospheres than in monolayer
cells. This implies that an alternative pathway takes
charge of protein degradation. Indeed, LC3-II level,
which is accepted as a marker of autophagy activity,
was found to be elevated, indicating that autophagic
protein degradation maintains protein homeostasis
in mammospheres. Whereas, it was notable that both
the transcript and protein levels of p62, a substrate of
autophagy, were elevated in mammospheres. Since the
regulation mechanism of p62 protein is highly complex
[51], we hypothesized that p62 increase may have a
specific role in cancer spheres. In particular, there have
been lines of evidence indicating a positive regulation of
NRF2 by p62. Overexpression of p62 led to disruption
of NRF2-KEAP1 binding through the direct interaction
with KEAP1, resulting in NRF2 stabilization [25, 26]. In
other system, KEAP1 protein was constantly degraded
by the autophagy process through the action of p62 [52].
These indicate that p62 can activate NRF2 signaling in
certain conditions. In effect, a number of human tumors
accumulate p62 and this phenomenon was associated
with NRF2 activation [53]. Our current data adduce an
additional role of p62 in CSC-enriched mammospheres,
showing that p62 activates NRF2 signaling. As direct
evidence, p62 knockdown MCF7 mammospheres
displayed lower levels of NRF2 and its target gene
expression. The relative contribution of the proteasome
and p62 to NRF2 activation remains elusive. Rather than
a separate contribution, these two phenomena could be
8179

Cell culture

dynamically linked. For example, p62 is also a known
NRF2 target gene, generating a positive feedback loop
between NRF2 and p62 [24]. Our results show that p62
mRNA level was also increased in mammospheres and
this raises the possibility that the proteasome reductionmediated NRF2 increase may cause p62 increase and a
further activation of NRF2. Additionally, proteasome
dysfunction is known to be a stimulator of autophagy as
a compensatory mechanism. In mutant mice with reduced
liver proteasome activity, autophagic activity was
enhanced and p62 protein level was increased, leading
to NRF2 activation [54]. Although p62 knockdown
did not affect NRF2 activation level in this study, the
results suggest that proteasome reduction may lead to
autophagic activation. Thus, it can be suggested that an
altered proteasome function in mammospheres could
lead to NRF2 stabilization and this in turn, could result
in p62 elevation and additional feed forward activation
of NRF2. At the same time, reduced proteasome function
in mammospheres activates autophagy system and
this compensation appears to maintain sphere protein
homeostasis favoring specific activation of signaling
molecules for sphere survival.
Collectively, our data showed the role of NRF2
increase in CSC phenotypes using the CSC-enriched
cancer cell spheres. In particular, we revealed that
proteasome reduction and p62 accumulation contributed to
NRF2 protein stabilization and enhanced sphere growth/
survival and stress resistance.

The human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 was
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, MD, USA). MCF7 cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (HyClone,

bromide. Transduction was continued for 48 h and followed
by a 24 h-recovery in complete medium. For the selection
of stable transgene-expressing cells, puromycin (2 μg/mL)
incubation was continued for up to 4 weeks.

A-sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ,
USA) at 4°C for 2 h, washed three times with RIPA buffer
and boiled for 5 min in sample loading buffer (200 mM Tris
[pH 6.8], 400 mM DTT, 8% SDS, 0.08% bromophenol blue,
and 40% glycerol). The protein samples were separated by
electrophoresis on 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman GmbH,
Dassel, Germany) using a Trans-Blot Semi-Dry Cell (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membrane was blocked
with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h, and then incubated with
the antibodies. Following the addition of the enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Scientific), images
were detected using a GE Healthcare LAS-4000 mini
imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

Total RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the
TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). For the synthesis
of cDNA, RT reactions were performed by incubating
200 ng of total RNA with a reaction mixture containing
0.5 μg/μL oligo dT12–18 and 200 U/μL moloney murine
leukemia virus RT (Life Technologies). Real-time
RT-PCR was carried out using a Roche Light Cycler
(Mannheim, Germany) with the Takara SYBR Premix
ExTaq System for relative quantification. Primers were
synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon, Republic of Korea)
and primer sequences for the human genes are described
in our previous studies [56, 57]. PCR primers for CD44
are 5′-AGCAGCACTTCAGGAGGTTAC-3′ and
5′-TGCCTCTTGGTTGCTGTCTC-3′.

Measurement of ROS
Cellular ROS levels were determined using
the fluorescent carboxy-H2DCFDA. Briefly, MCF7
mammospheres were incubated with 30 μM carboxyH2DCFDA for 30 min and fluorescence images were
obtained using appropriate filters (488/524 nm) in a LSM
710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

MTT assay
Viable cell numbers were determined by MTT
assay. MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103
cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated with the relevant
compounds (doxorubicin, H2O2, or 5-FU) for the indicated
times. MTT solution (2 mg/mL) was added to the cells and
further incubated for 4 h. The MTT solution was removed,
100 μL/well of DMSO was added, and the absorbance was
measured at 540 nm using a SPECTRO StarNano (BMG
LABTECH GmbH, Allmendgruen, Ortenberg, Germany).

Measurement of ARE-luciferase activity
The cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density
of 2.0 × 104 cells/well and grown overnight. The next
day, the transfection complex containing 0.5 μg of the
ARE-luciferase plasmid along with 0.05 μg of pRLtk
control plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the
transfection reagent (WelGENE Inc.) was added to each
well. After 18 h, the transfection complex was removed
and the cells were incubated in a complete medium
for 24 h. The cells were then lysed. Renilla and Firefly
luciferase levels were measured using the Dual Luciferase
Assay System (Promega) as described previously [58].

Nuclear protein extraction
Cells were lysed with homogenization buffer (2 M
sucrose, 1 M HEPES, 2 M MgCl2, 2 M KCl, 30% glycerol,
0.5 M EDTA, 1 M dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor cocktail,
and 10% NP-40) and followed by centrifugation at 12000 g
for 15 min to collect crude nuclear fractions. Nuclear
proteins were then extracted by incubating crude nuclear
fractions with extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9),
1.5 mM MgCl2, 420 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM
EDTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30 min on ice.

Annexin V-PI staining
For the assessment of apoptotic cells in mammo­
spheres, Annexin V (for early apoptosis) and PI (for late
apoptosis) were incubated in cells and fluorescent intensities
were monitored. MCF7 mammospheres were collected
by gentle centrifugation and were dissociated into single
cells using trypsin. After washing with cold PBS, cells
were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated annexin V antibody and PI at room temperature
for 10 min. Fluorescence images were then obtained using a
LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss).

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% NP40) containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma–Aldrich). The protein
concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid
assay (BCA) kit (Thermo Scientific, Middletown, VA,
USA). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiUb antibody or anti-NRF2 antibody at 4°C overnight.
The immune complexes were then incubated with protein

(ODC) [59] was fused to the luciferase-coding region
and was then inserted into pLKO.1 plasmid (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA, USA) to generate the pLKO.1-ODCpddluciferase plasmid. For the measurement of the proteasome
proteolytic activity, the pLKO.1-ODCpdd-luciferase
plasmid was transfected into cells and luciferase activity
was monitored 24 h after transfection.

Measurement of the proteasome peptidase
activity
The peptidase activities of the 19S proteasome
catalytic subunits were measured by mixing cell lysates
with 50 μM of fluorogenic substrates Suc-LLVY-AMC
(chymotrypsin-like proteases; PSMB5), Z-LLE-AMC
(caspase-like proteases; PSMB6), or Z-ARR-AMC
(trypsin-like proteases; PSMB7) in a final volume of
100 μL of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, 20
mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). The mixture
was incubated at 37°C for 20 min and the reaction was
then stopped by addition of an equal volume of 125 mM
sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0) containing 7.5% ethanol.
The fluorescence of the cleaved AMC moiety was
measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and
emission wavelength of 460 nm using a SpectraMax M5
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
