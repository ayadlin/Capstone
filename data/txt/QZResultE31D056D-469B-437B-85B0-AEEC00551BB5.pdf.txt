action (also known as genomic action or nuclear-initiated steroid
signaling; ref. 2), substantial experimental evidence for nongenomic
action of ER has also recently solidified (3). This nongenomic
action of ER (also known as membrane-initiated steroid signaling (MISS; ref. 2) may be mediated by the interaction between the
small fraction of ER that resides in or at the vicinity of the plasma
membrane and may activate various components of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, such as insulin-like growth
factor receptor-IR (IGF-IR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR;
or HER1), and HER2 (4–6).
Tamoxifen is a selective ER modulator, with mixed ER agonist/
antagonist activities, that is thought to work by competitive blockade of the ER, thereby inhibiting estrogen-dependent gene transcription and tumor growth (7). Despite its benefit in patients with
all stages of ER-positive breast cancer (8), the major obstacle to its
use is treatment resistance, which either occurs de novo or is later
acquired after initial benefit. The underlying mechanisms for
tamoxifen resistance are probably multifactorial but remain largely
unknown. In recent years, however, compelling evidence suggests
that increased growth factor signaling, in particular the EGFR/
HER2 pathway, contributes to this resistance (9). Results from
numerous, although not all, clinical studies suggest that breast
cancers with overexpression of HER2 and/or EGFR are less likely to
benefit from tamoxifen (10–13). Using a preclinical model of breast
cancer, we have recently shown that overexpression of HER2 leads
to increased cross talk between ER and the EGFR/HER2 pathways,
as well as enhanced MISS activity of ER. MISS is activated by both
estrogen and selective ER modulators, causing tamoxifen to behave
as an estrogen agonist and to stimulate growth as the mechanism
of de novo resistance in xenograft tumors (9). When these cells are
grown in tissue culture in vitro, short-term tamoxifen treatment
also functions as an agonist on estrogen-regulated genes (9).
Less is known about the mechanisms of acquired tamoxifen
resistance in breast tumors with initially low or normal levels of
EGFR/HER2. Because biomarker data from human tumors progressing on tamoxifen are limited, preclinical models are crucial
tools to study mechanisms and new strategies to overcome resistance. The goal of the present study was to investigate tamoxifen
resistance mechanisms in vivo by studying ER-dependent genomic
and nongenomic functions, as well as growth factor signaling,
which has been implicated in resistance to endocrine therapy.
We studied an experimental model of tamoxifen resistance using
ER-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells grown as xenografts
in athymic nude mice (14). Tamoxifen treatment suppresses tumor
growth for several months, but growth eventually resumes as the
tumors become stimulated by tamoxifen (15). Here, we show that
activation of EGFR/HER2 and IGF-IR signaling, at least in part via

Abstract
Not all breast cancers respond to tamoxifen, and many develop
resistance despite initial benefit. We used an in vivo model
of estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer (MCF-7
xenografts) to investigate mechanisms of this resistance and
develop strategies to circumvent it. Epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and HER2, which were barely detected in
control estrogen-treated tumors, increased slightly with
tamoxifen and were markedly increased when tumors became
resistant. Gefitinib, which inhibits EGFR/HER2, improved the
antitumor effect of tamoxifen and delayed acquired resistance,
but had no effect on estrogen-stimulated growth. Phosphorylated levels of p42/44 and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinases (both downstream of EGFR/HER2) were increased in
the tamoxifen-resistant tumors and were suppressed by
gefitinib. There was no apparent increase in phosphorylated
AKT (also downstream of EGFR/HER2) in resistant tumors, but
it was nonetheless suppressed by gefitinib. Phosphorylated
insulin-like growth factor-IR (IGF-IR), which can interact with
both EGFR and membrane ER, was elevated in the tamoxifenresistant tumors compared with the sensitive group. However,
ER-regulated gene products, including total IGF-IR itself and
progesterone receptor, remained suppressed even at the time
of acquired resistance. Tamoxifen’s antagonism of classic ER
genomic function was retained in these resistant tumors and
even in tumors that overexpress HER2 (MCF-7 HER2/18) and
are de novo tamoxifen-resistant. In conclusion, EGFR/HER2
may mediate tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer
despite continued suppression of ER genomic function by
tamoxifen. IGF-IR expression remains dependent on ER but is
activated in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors. This study
provides a rationale to combine HER inhibitors with tamoxifen in clinical studies, even in tumors that do not initially
overexpress EGFR/HER2. [Cancer Res 2008;68(3):826–33]

Introduction
The estrogen receptor (ER) is a nuclear ligand–dependent
transcription factor that is believed to communicate most of
estrogen’s mitogenic and survival stimuli in breast cancer via direct
modulation of gene expression (1). In addition to this mode of ER

peroxidase–labeled antirabbit (1:2,000) as secondary antibody (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were then washed in PBST, after which the
labeled protein was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system (Amersham Pharmacia) and exposure of the membranes
on X-ray film (Kodak). All gels were run thrice (except for p-IGF-IR, which
was run twice). Individual tumors for each shown marker were from gels
that were run simultaneously. Representative blots are presented.
Affymetrix microarray analysis. Gene expression patterns of three
estrogen-stimulated and four tamoxifen citrate–resistant/stimulated tumor
xenografts were determined using U133plus2 Affymetrix Genechip Arrays;
each profile was from a different tumor grown in a different mouse (seven
profiles in all). RNA extraction was carried out in BioRobot EZ1 workstation
using an EZ1 RNA universal tissue kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis, cRNA labeling, and array hybridization were performed as previously described (19). Arrays were normalized
and compared using DNA Chip Analyzer software (dChip; ref. 20). Array
data has been deposited in the public Gene Expression Omnibus database
(accession GSE7327). Transcripts with average estimated expression in the
bottom 50% of the dataset were removed from the analysis. Two-sample
t tests using log-transformed data were performed as criteria for determining significant differences in mean gene mRNA levels between groups of
samples. Fold changes between groups were estimated by taking the ratio
between the average of the estimated expression values of the one group
versus that of the other. Expression values were visualized as color maps
using the Cluster and Java TreeView software (21, 22). Expression patterns
from the xenograft tumor profile dataset were examined in the public
profile datasets (23, 24) by joining the Affymetrix probe set identifier, and
the statistical significance of the overlap between the gene sets was
examined by a one-sided Fisher’s exact.
Statistical analysis. Tumor growth curves were constructed using the
mean tumor volume at each time point of measurement with error bars
representing SEs. Median time to progression was calculated using KaplanMeier survival curves with 95% confidence intervals, and tumor volume
tripling was used as the end point for progression for each tumor. Comparison among groups was accomplished using ANOVA. After significant
differences among groups were established, contrasts were generated to
perform pairwise comparisons between any two groups of Fgefitinib with
adjustment in P values due to multiple testing based on the permutation
method. The two-sample t test was used for two-group comparisons. To
compare the mean tumor volumes in the tamoxifen citrate group with
those in the tamoxifen citrate + gefitinib group, the difference in tumor
volume from each day (day 7, day 14, day 21, day 28, day 35, day 42, day 49)
versus day 0 was calculated. A growth curve model on the log of this
difference was fitted to compare slopes between tamoxifen citrate and
tamoxifen citrate + gefitinib groups. All P values were two-tailed.

ER nongenomic mechanisms, mediates growth in the tamoxifenresistant tumors, whereas classic ER genomic function remains
suppressed. We also show that targeting HER signaling using the
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa)
can improve tamoxifen benefit and delay acquired resistance to
therapy.

Materials and Methods
Reagents, hormones, and antibodies. Tamoxifen citrate was purchased
from Sigma. Gefitinib was provided by AstraZeneca. Immunoblotting
antibodies included total EGFR, total HER2, IGF-IR, phosphorylated IGF-IR
(p-IGF-IR), Akt (Ser437), p42/44 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), total MAPK, and
phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) from Cell Signaling Technology and ERa (H184), progesterone receptor (A and B), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1),
BCL-2, and cyclin D1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Xenograft studies. MCF-7 cells were maintained in culture as previously
described (15). MCF-7 xenografts were established in ovariectomized 5week-old to 6-week-old nu/nu athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley)
supplemented with 0.25 mg 21-day release estrogen pellets (Innovative
Research) by inoculating s.c. 5  106 cells as previously described (16).
When tumors reached the size of 150 to 200 mm3 (3–5 weeks), the animals
were randomly allocated (n = 12 per group) to continued estrogen (E2),
estrogen withdrawal alone ( E2, by removal of the estrogen pellets),
estrogen withdrawal plus tamoxifen citrate (500 Ag/animal in peanut oil by
s.c. injection 5 days/week), with either gefitinib (100 mg/kg, 5 days/week) or
vehicle (1% Tween 80) given by gavage. Tumor growth was assessed, and
tumor volumes were measured as described previously (16). Tumors were
harvested for molecular studies after 3 weeks of treatment (sensitive
tumors, n = 3–4) and when they became resistant to treatment and reached
the size of 1,000 mm3 (n = 8). Each tumor analyzed was from a different
mouse; tumor tissues were removed from each individual mouse and kept
at 190jC for later analyses. Mice were maintained and sacrificed
according to institutional guidelines. In a separate xenograft experiment,
MCF-7 HER2-18 cells (MCF-7 cells engineered to overexpress HER2; refs. 9,
17) were used to establish tumors in ovariectomized nu/nu athymic nude
mice supplemented with estrogen pellets as previously described (9, 18).
When tumors reached the size of f200 mm3 (2–4 weeks), the animals were
randomly allocated (n = 12–16 per group) to receive continued estrogen
supplementation alone (E2), estrogen supplementation plus tamoxifen
(+E2 + TAM), estrogen withdrawal alone ( E2), or estrogen withdrawal plus
tamoxifen ( E2 + TAM). Tumor growth curves were constructed as previously described (18).
Tumor extracts and immunoblots. Three to four individual frozen
tumors from each of the different treatment groups were manually
homogenized in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with
10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Tumor lysates were
collected, sonicated (5 for 5 s on ice), and microcentrifuged at 15,300g
for 20 min at 2jC. Supernatants of the lysates were aliquoted and stored at
70jC. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to manufacturer’s directions. Equivalent amounts of protein from each sample were separated under
denaturing conditions by electrophoresis on 8% to 10% polyacrylamide gels
containing SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were first stained with
Ponceau S to confirm uniform transfer of all samples and confirm
equivalent loading and then immunoblotted with the specific antibodies
according to the manufacturer’s directions. Briefly, blots were blocked with
blocking buffer [5% w/v nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.3% Trition X-100 (pH
7.5) and 0.9% NaCl containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST)] for 1 h and then
reacted with primary antibodies at dilutions per the manufacturer’
directions for all phosphorylated antibodies in 5% bovine serum albumin
in PBST overnight at 4jC or otherwise in blocking buffer for 2 h at room
temperature. The blots were washed thrice in PBST and then incubated for
1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST and horseradish

Results
Acquired tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7 tumors is associated with increased EGFR/HER2 expression. First, we examined
the levels of EGFR and HER2 in tumors that were treated with
tamoxifen (given along with estrogen withdrawal) and in tumors
treated with estrogen withdrawal alone (Fig. 1). Compared with the
control estrogen-stimulated tumors, in which EGFR was undetectable, levels of EGFR increased in the tamoxifen-sensitive tumors
and increased markedly when tumors progressed, suggesting
that this pathway may play a role in acquired tamoxifen resistance
(Fig. 1A). In contrast, levels of EGFR were not increased in tumors
resistant to estrogen withdrawal alone, suggesting that EGFR does
not contribute to acquired resistance to this type of endocrine
therapy in this model. Levels of HER2 were also very low or
undetectable in estrogen-stimulated tumors, but upon estrogen
withdrawal, whether alone or with tamoxifen, there was a modest
induction of HER2 expression that persisted at the time of acquired
resistance (Fig. 1B).

of EGFR in these tumors and suggests that estrogen-stimulated
growth does not rely on EGFR signaling (Fig. 2A). Gefitinib significantly improved the antitumor effect of tamoxifen, however, as
evidenced by the lower mean tumor volume in the combination
group compared with the tamoxifen alone group (as measured
by the difference in tumor volume on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42,
P = 0.05; see Materials and Methods). Importantly, the median time
to development of resistance in the tamoxifen plus gefitinib group
was significantly prolonged; 161 days with gefitinib [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 154–210] compared with 105 days (95% CI,
77–161) with tamoxifen alone (P = 0.0149; Fig. 2A).
Because EGFR expression is highest in resistant tumors, we
investigated whether using gefitinib later would be more effective

Gefitinib improves tamoxifen response and delays acquired
resistance in MCF-7 tumors. Because acquired resistance to
tamoxifen was associated with increased EGFR and HER2 levels,
we hypothesized that an EGFR/HER2 pathway inhibitor might
delay the emergence of resistance. Mice bearing MCF-7 tumors
established in the presence of estrogen were randomized to receive
continued estrogen supplementation (control), estrogen withdrawal alone, or estrogen withdrawal plus tamoxifen, each group
either alone or in combination with gefitinib (an EGFR TKI that
inhibits signaling from EGFR homodimers and heterodimers of
EGFR with HER2 and HER3; Fig. 2; refs. 9, 25, 26). There was no
growth inhibition using gefitinib as a single agent to treat estrogenstimulated tumors, which is consistent with the undetectable levels

the different tumor groups (Fig. 3B). P-IGF-IR levels were reduced
in the tamoxifen-inhibited tumors compared with the control
estrogen-stimulated tumors, suggesting that activation of IGF-IR is
mainly dependent on ER in these MCF-7 tumors. Indeed, gefitinib
had little effect on phosphorylation of IGF-IR in the estrogenstimulated tumors (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, however, p-IGF-IR levels
were increased in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors compared with
the tamoxifen-sensitive group, although total IGF-IR levels were
markedly reduced as shown in the next figure (Fig. 4A).
Tamoxifen activates growth factor–regulated transcription
but continues to suppress ER genomic function at the time of
resistance. We have previously shown that MCF-7 xenografts that
become resistant to tamoxifen continue to express high levels of ER
(28). Interestingly, when we studied the expression levels of proteins known to be regulated by ER (progesterone receptor, IGF-IR,
IRS-1, BCL-2, cyclin D1) in these resistant MCF-7 tumors, we found
that levels continued to be effectively suppressed at the time of
acquired resistance to tamoxifen, except for cyclin D1, which is
also known to be up-regulated by growth factor signaling (Fig. 4A;
ref. 29). The markedly reduced levels of total IGF-IR suggest
that IGF-IR is dependent on ER for expression and is therefore
reduced upon ER inhibition. However, despite the very low total
IGF-IR level at the time of acquired tamoxifen resistance, remaining IGF-IR is strongly phosphorylated and therefore activated,
suggesting that it may contribute to the development of resistance
in this model.
To determine whether the observed down-regulation of selected
ER-inducible gene targets in tamoxifen resistance was a result of
a systematic shutdown of the estrogen signaling pathway, we
compared global gene expression profiles of tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 xenograft tumors with estrogen-supplemented tumors.
Analysis of the data revealed 1,113 RNA transcripts that were
differentially expressed between the two xenograft groups (P < 0.01,
fold change > 1.5; Fig. 4B, panel 1). A set of 369 RNA transcripts,
representing f249 unique-named genes, had consistently higher

than earlier when EGFR is lower. One group of mice was treated
with tamoxifen alone, and then gefitinib was added on day 49
(tamoxifen plus late gefitinib group; Fig. 2B). Although there was a
trend for delayed resistance in the late gefitinib group compared
with tamoxifen alone (median time to resistance of 122 days;
95% CI, 91–147), this difference was not statistically significant
(P = 0.5296). Median time to the development of resistance in this
tamoxifen plus late gefitinib group, however, was statistically
significantly shorter than the group receiving tamoxifen and
gefitinib from the outset (P = 0.0137). When gefitinib was combined
with estrogen withdrawal, there was a trend for delayed resistance
compared with estrogen withdrawal alone with a median time to
resistance of 84 days (95% CI, 70–89) versus 42 days (95% CI,
21–133; Fig. 2C), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.1911).
Gefitinib inhibits phosphorylation of EGFR/HER2 downstream signaling kinases in tamoxifen-treated MCF-7 tumors.
To explore the potential mechanisms by which gefitinib may delay
the EGFR-mediated tamoxifen resistance, we examined the levels
of phosphorylated MAPK (p-MAPK) 42/44, phosphorylated AKT
(p-AKT), and the stress signaling intermediate p-p38 MAPK, all of
which are activated downstream of EGFR/HER2 (Fig. 3A). Whereas
p-MAPK 42/44 was increased in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors
compared with the tamoxifen-sensitive ones, p-AKT was only
minimally changed at the time of resistance. P-p38 MAPK, on the
other hand, increased slightly in the tamoxifen-sensitive tumors
compared with the control estrogen-stimulated tumors and
increased further at the time of acquired resistance to tamoxifen
as previously shown (Fig. 3A; ref. 27). Gefitinib reduced the levels of
p-MAPK 42/44 and p-AKT both in the control estrogen and in the
tamoxifen-treated tumors. Gefitinib also reduced the level of p-p38
in the tamoxifen-treated tumors.
In view of recent data suggesting that the IGF-IR, via dimerizing
with or indirectly activating of EGFR, may play a role in mediating
ER activation of EGFR (6), we next measured levels of p-IGF-IR in

although it did not reach the predefined level of 1.5-fold change.
In addition to the dataset of estrogen targets in vitro (23), we
considered two independently derived profile datasets of estrogeninducible genes, one from profiling MCF-7 xenografts deprived of
estrogen for 24 to 48 h in vivo (653 genes with P < 0.001; ref. 23) and
one of 151 up-regulated estrogen-responsive genes found to be
adjacent to ER-binding sites (30). Both of these gene sets were also
highly enriched within the 249 genes down-regulated in our in vivo
tamoxifen-resistant set, with 52 genes of the first dataset (23)
overlapping at P of <1e 30 by one-sided Fisher’s exact test and
40 genes of the second dataset (30) overlapping at P of <1e 40).
In contrast, from the gene expression profile data, 744 transcripts, representing f579 unique genes, were consistently higher
in the tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 xenograft tumors compared with
the estrogen-stimulated tumors (Fig. 4B, panel 1). The expression

expression in the estrogen-stimulated tumors compared with the
tamoxifen-resistant tumors.
To further characterize these differentially expressed genes for
the recognition of molecular pathways associated with tamoxifen
resistance, we identified a subset of these 1,113 transcripts that
were commonly represented in expression array platforms used
in previous studies of similar and relevant breast cancer models
(23, 24) and included 639 transcripts. Two hundred seventeen of
these 639 transcripts (Fig. 4B, panel 2), representing f173 uniquenamed genes, were overexpressed in the estrogen-stimulated
tumors. Of these genes, 61 were also found to be rapidly induced
by estrogen in breast cancer cell cultures in a previously published
dataset (ref. 23; Fig. 4B, panel 3); this overlap between the two
gene sets was highly significant (P < 1e 20; one-sided Fisher’s
exact test). These genes included those for which the protein
products are displayed in Fig. 4A, except for cyclin D1, which was

such treatment and serve to identify new targets to overcome
resistance. Data from cell culture models suggest that EGFR plays a
role in tamoxifen resistance in vitro, where it may provide alternate
survival mechanisms that reduce cancer cell dependence on ER
(31). Other published work in a model of long-term tamoxifen
treatment and tumor retransplantation also supports a role for the
HER family members in acquired tamoxifen resistance (32). EGFR
is not infrequently expressed in clinical breast cancer and may
indeed predict reduced benefit from tamoxifen (11, 33–35).
Inhibition of EGFR can reverse tamoxifen resistance in breast
cancer cells in vitro (36, 37), suggesting a role for EGFR as a target
to modulate endocrine response.
In this paper, we report, using an in vivo model of ER-positive
breast cancer, that acquired resistance to tamoxifen is associated
with elevated levels of EGFR and activation of its downstream
kinase signaling and gene expression program. We further reveal
that this phenotype of tamoxifen’s agonist effect on tumor growth
occurs while it retains its antagonist effect on classic ER-mediated
gene expression, and suggest that nongenomic ER-mediated
activation of EGFR may be a predominant mechanism of acquired
resistance. Moreover, our new observation that ER-mediated gene
expression remains suppressed by tamoxifen in vivo even in the
de novo resistant HER2-overexpressing MCF-7 xenografts supports
the idea that in vivo tamoxifen resistance/stimulated growth in
these two models is driven by nongenomic actions of ER. Of
significant note, there is currently no direct evidence or complete
molecular details portraying the nongenomic ER action responsible
for tamoxifen resistance in vivo. However, previous observations
showed that these EGFR-overexpressing tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 tumors retain expression of ER and remain sensitive to
subsequent endocrine therapy with fulvestrant (15), suggesting that
resistance cannot be driven solely by EGFR (or HER2) and that ER
must share a role in the resistance mechanism. This concept is
supported by parallel in vitro cell culture models of tamoxifen
resistance (5, 9).
Our finding that classic ER function remains suppressed in
tamoxifen-resistant tumors was shown both at the level of protein expression of selected classically ER-dependent genes and by
global gene expression microarray studies. The comparison of
global gene expression profiles between the tamoxifen-resistant
tumors and the estrogen-stimulated ones clearly showed that
whereas classic estrogen-induced gene expression profiles were
absent in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors, other growth factor
pathway–dependent expression profiles, especially of the EGFR/
HER2 pathway and its downstream Raf/Mek signaling, now
became established. This is in contrast to our previous observations in vitro involving HER2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells in which
tamoxifen induced both classic genomic and nongenomic ER
functions (9). Our new findings suggest that tamoxifen resistance
in vivo is predominantly mediated by nongenomic mechanisms
and that classic ER genomic action does not play a major role,
although other nonclassic ER genomic mechanisms could also
potentially play a role in this system (38). The relative contribution of genomic versus nongenomic ER functions to tamoxifen
resistance may therefore involve a spectrum rather than a single
mechanism, and this may depend on multiple factors, including the
tumor milieu and the duration of tamoxifen exposure (9, 32, 39).
Confirming the functional role of EGFR in acquired tamoxifenstimulated growth, the EGFR TKI gefitinib markedly delayed
acquired resistance when used in combination with tamoxifen in
this in vivo model. Of note, gefitinib improved the antitumor effect

patterns for these genes were also examined in a published profile
dataset of MCF-7 cultures, with stably overexpressed EGFR or
constitutively activated HER2, Raf, or MAP/extracellular signalregulated kinase kinase, which had resulted in these cell lines
exhibiting hyperactivation of MAPK and estrogen-independent
growth (Fig. 4B, panel 4; ref. 24). Interestingly and in agreement
with our data from the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A), genes
showing up-regulation by tamoxifen treatment in our xenograft
model shared extensive overlap with genes that were activated
in vitro by the HER growth factor receptor signaling. Of the 354
tamoxifen-induced genes represented in the cell culture dataset
(Fig. 4B, panel 2), 81 showed up-regulation (P < 0.01) by HER2 and
45 showed up-regulation by EGFR (Fig. 4B, panel 4). The extent
of gene overlap was highly significant in each case (P < 1e 11 and
P < 1e 6, respectively; one-sided Fisher’s exact test). In addition,
extensive overlap was observed between the genes down-regulated
in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors and genes down-regulated by
growth factor receptor signaling (Fig. 4B, panel 4). Collectively, data
from this model suggest that acquired tamoxifen resistance occurs
relatively independent of classic ER-regulated genomic function
and is largely mediated by activation of growth factor receptor
signaling, possibly through a nongenomic ER-driven mechanism
that is inhibited by the HER inhibitor gefitinib.
Previously, we reported that when HER2 is overexpressed in
MCF-7 cells, the resultant derivative clone (MCF-7 HER2/18)
develops enhanced bidirectional cross talk between ER and HER2,
resulting in activation of both genomic and nongenomic ERmediated signaling upon tamoxifen treatment in vitro (9). To
investigate whether HER2 augments ER-dependent classic transcription functions in vivo, we measured the levels of the same ERdependent proteins from Fig. 4A in MCF-7 HER2/18 xenografts,
which we have previously shown are de novo stimulated by
tamoxifen (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, even with marked overexpression
of HER2 in these xenografts, levels of these classically ERdependent genes remained markedly suppressed in tamoxifenstimulated tumors, similar to the tumors that are inhibited by
estrogen withdrawal. This suggests that tamoxifen has no
demonstrable agonist effect on these ER-dependent classic
transcription functions and indeed may continue to function as a
partial estrogen antagonist for these genes even in tumors with
marked HER2 overexpression.
To investigate whether tamoxifen can still inhibit estrogenstimulated growth of tumors that overexpress HER2, we next
randomized mice bearing established MCF-7/HER2-18 tumors to
receive either continued estrogen alone, estrogen withdrawal alone,
tamoxifen plus estrogen, or tamoxifen plus estrogen withdrawal
(Fig. 4D). Remarkably, whereas tamoxifen showed agonist activity
on tumor growth as we have previously shown (9), it effectively
inhibited estrogen-stimulated tumor growth, thus exhibiting
simultaneous agonist and antagonist effects on ER function. Based
on our data, tamoxifen’s agonist effect in vivo is largely mediated by
activation of growth factor receptor signaling driven by ER
nongenomic function or perhaps other mechanisms, whereas
tamoxifen maintains its antagonist effect on at least some ERdependent genomic activities even at the time of therapeutic
resistance.

forms of endocrine therapy could help predict patient benefit from

release of heparin-bound epidermal growth factor, which in turn
activates EGFR and downstream signaling through MAPK and
possibly other signaling intermediates. Thus, activated IGF-IR may
mediate the interaction between ER and EGFR and could be responsible for tamoxifen resistance in this model. Recent in vitro data
in MCF-7 cells suggest that gefitinib can inhibit MAPK phosphorylation induced by IGF-I (50), presumably by blocking the interaction
between IGF-IR and EGFR (48, 51), supporting a potential role for
IGF-IR in cross-activation of EGFR. Further work is needed to clarify
this ER/IGF-IR/EGFR interaction in vivo and the potential role of
IGF-IR inhibitors in modulating tamoxifen resistance.
Another interesting finding in our model is the increase in p-p38
levels that begins during the tumor growth inhibition phase and
intensifies at the time of acquired tamoxifen resistance. Gefitinib
reduces p-p38 levels in these tamoxifen-sensitive tumors, suggesting that this kinase is regulated by EGFR and that it may contribute
to the development of the tamoxifen agonist effect. In other model
systems, p38 has been reported to phosphorylate both the ER and
its coactivator AIB1 in vitro (52, 53), enhance the agonist activity of
tamoxifen-bound ER on a specific subset of genes, and contribute
to tamoxifen resistance (54). Recent clinical reports of increased
p-p38 and HER2 in tumors progressing on tamoxifen also support a
role for p38 in tamoxifen resistance (42). Phosphorylated p42/44
MAPK, which is elevated in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors, may
contribute to tamoxifen’s agonist effect, and protein kinase Cy may
also play a role (55), suggesting that multiple and redundant intracellular signaling pathways may contribute to tamoxifen resistance,
especially in advanced stages of the disease.
In summary, data from this in vivo breast tumor model provide
strong evidence that tamoxifen resistance is mediated by activation
of HER family signaling, at least partly through ER-driven
nongenomic mechanisms, whereas classic ER genomic functions
remain largely suppressed by tamoxifen at the time of resistance.
These data add new insights about the mechanisms of breast
cancer resistance to tamoxifen and provide a strong rationale for
using HER pathway inhibitors to improve tamoxifen response and
delay emergence of resistance.

of tamoxifen from the outset, suggesting that the intrinsic agonist
effect of tamoxifen, driven in part by EGFR even when this receptor
is expressed at relatively low levels, is manifest from the very start.
This agonist growth–stimulating effect of tamoxifen increases over
time as EGFR/HER2 expression and signaling increase until it
eventually surpasses its estrogen antagonistic effects on genomic
ER activity leading to tumor progression. Because tamoxifen
induces expression of EGFR and HER2 from the beginning of
treatment, it is tempting to rationalize that tamoxifen may actually
generate a target for HER inhibitors, in contrast to the estrogenstimulated tumors which have very low EGFR expression and are
therefore not sensitive to gefitinib. This finding is consistent with
the limited efficacy of gefitinib when used as monotherapy in
unselected patients with advanced breast cancer (40).
Of potential clinical relevance, gefitinib had only a modest effect
when combined with estrogen deprivation in our model, in which
tumor resistance was not accompanied by an increase in EGFR
levels. HER2, on the other hand, seems to be modestly increased in
the estrogen-deprived tumors, similar to reported data from other
models (41), suggesting that HER2 may be preferentially upregulated by estrogen deprivation. Although no specific clinical
data exist about HER2 up-regulation in patients progressing on
estrogen deprivation therapies, there is evidence that HER2 levels
can increase over time in patients given endocrine therapy in
general (42, 43). Interestingly, preclinical studies, as well as recent
clinical studies, support combining aromatase inhibitors with
growth factor pathway inhibitors in the subset of breast cancers
overexpressing HER2 (18, 44), whereas using growth factor pathway
inhibitors in combination with aromatase inhibitors was not
beneficial in unselected patients with breast cancer (45, 46).
An interesting observation in this model is the dissociation
between the level of total IGF-IR and that of its phosphorylated
form (p-IGF-IR) in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors. Because IGF-IR
is an ER-dependent gene product, it is not surprising that tamoxifen, which effectively inhibits classically ER-dependent transcription, can effectively reduce its expression. Even at the time of
acquired resistance to tamoxifen, IGF-IR levels remain suppressed
by tamoxifen, similar to previously reported observations from
in vitro cell systems (47, 48). In contrast, p-IGF-IR, although initially
reduced in the tamoxifen-sensitive tumors, is increased at the time
of resistance. This suggests that IGF-IR becomes activated at the
time of acquired resistance and then augments important cell
survival pathways. A recent model proposed by Song et al. (49)
suggests that ER outside the nucleus, which can be activated by
estrogen and tamoxifen, may associate with IGF-IR in the cell
membrane as part of a receptor complex that includes Shc and
EGFR. Subsequently, activation of metalloproteinases leads to
