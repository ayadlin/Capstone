BACKGROUND: Most patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) harbor residual disease, as evidenced by
molecular techniques even after treatment with high-dose imatinib (ie, 800 mg/d). Interferon alpha (IFN a) is efficacious in CML likely due to its immunomodulatory properties, and is synergistic in vitro with imatinib and granulocyte
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). METHODS: A study was undertaken to determine whether adding
pegylated (PEG) IFN a-2b and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib may improve the complete molecular response rate in
patients with CML in chronic phase. Ninety-four patients were treated with imatinib 800 mg/d for the first 6 months,
then randomly assigned to continue high-dose imatinib alone (n ¼ 49) or in combination with PEG IFN a-2b 0.5 lg/
kg/wk and GM-CSF 125 mg/m2 3 weekly (n ¼ 45). RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 54 months
(range, 7-70 months). There were no differences in the rates of complete cytogenetic response (87% vs 90%; P ¼
1.0), or of major (77% vs 77%; P ¼ 1.0) or complete (11% vs 13%; P ¼ 1.0) molecular response (on the international
scale) at 12 months between the 2 arms, or at any time during the study. Adverse events led to PEG IFN a-2b discontinuation in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of PEG IFN a-2b and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib therapy
does not improve significantly the cytogenetic or molecular response rates compared with high-dose imatinib alone.
The high dropout rate in the PEG IFN a-2b arm may have compromised its potential immunomodulatory benefit.

Standard dose imatinib mesylate therapy (ie, 400 mg/d) is associated with complete hematologic response (CHR)
and complete cytogenetic response rates of 98% and 82%, respectively, in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
in chronic phase.1 High-dose imatinib (ie, 800 mg/d) renders complete cytogenetic response rates of 89% in chronic phase
CML after interferon-alpha (IFN a) failure,2 and of 90% in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML.3 Achieving a complete
molecular response (ie, undetectable BCR-ABL) may further improve event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).4
Alternatively, patients who fail to achieve a major molecular response (ie, 3-log reduction or 0.1%) may have an
increased risk of losing their cytogenetic response,5 and of developing ABL1 kinase domain mutations.6 Most patients
treated with imatinib harbor residual molecular disease, which supports the notion that imatinib fails to eradicate quiescent BCR-ABL1-positive stem cells.7-9
IFN a produces complete cytogenetic response rates ranging from 5% to 27%,10-13 and many of those who achieved
a major molecular response have not progressed after long-term follow-up (even after IFN a discontinuation),14 which
has been linked to the immunomodulatory properties of IFN a.15 IFN a synergizes in vitro with imatinib,16 which suggests that IFN a may enhance the clinical activity of imatinib. Pegylated (PEG) IFN a-2b, a more tolerable form of IFN a

with a longer half-life, in combination with imatinib rendered major cytogenetic response rates of 80% at 6
months in the frontline setting, and of 60% in patients after IFN a failure, suggesting in vivo synergism.17 The
combination of IFN a and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a potent stimulus of
dendritic cell differentiation of CML mononuclear
cells.18 The addition of GM-CSF to IFN a has been
reported to be well tolerated and has resulted in excellent
results compared with other IFN a-based regimens in
early chronic phase CML.19,20 Based on these data, we
designed a randomized phase 2 study to investigate
whether adding PEG IFN a-2b and GM-CSF to highdose imatinib would increase the rate of major molecular
response and prolong remission duration in patients with
early chronic phase CML compared with high-dose imatinib therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients aged 18 years with CML in early chronic phase
(<12 months from diagnosis) were eligible. Except for
hydroxyurea, patients should have received no or minimal
prior therapy (<1 month of IFN a and/or standard-dose
imatinib). Other eligibility criteria were: 1) performance
status 2 by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
scale; 2) serum creatinine and total bilirubin <1.5 the
upper limit of normal; 3) patients with clonal evolution
were eligible in the absence of other signs of accelerated
phase (AP); 4) women of childbearing potential were
required to practice effective contraception methods; and
5) signed informed consent.
Treatment Schedule
Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 arms at the time of
study entry. Both arms received imatinib 400 mg twice
daily for the first 6 months as a single agent. After 6
months, patients randomized to Arm A continued therapy
with single-agent imatinib 400 mg twice daily or at the
same dose they were receiving at the 6-month mark if
dose reductions were required during the first 6 months of
therapy. Those randomized to Arm B continued imatinib
400 mg twice daily (or current dose at the 6-month mark)
plus PEG IFN a-2b (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ)
0.5 lg/kg subcutaneously weekly and GM-CSF (Berlex,
Seattle, Wash) 125 lg/m2 3 per week. Hydroxyurea
and/or anagrelide were allowed before and during the first
6 weeks of therapy for white blood debulking.

No further imatinib dose escalation beyond 800 mg daily.

Dose Modifications
Dose adjustments were done as per Table 1. An individual
drug could be discontinued in the event of excessive toxicity after appropriate dose reductions and management.
Toxicities were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0. Drugs
were dose-adjusted as follows (Table 1).
PEG IFN a-2b

For grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicities, therapy
was held until toxicity resolved to grade 1 and then
resumed with 1 dose level reduction; for persistent grade 2
toxicity not responsive to supportive measures, therapy
was reduced by 1 dose level.
Imatinib

For grade 2 nonhematologic toxicity unresponsive
to therapy, imatinib was withheld until resolution to
grade 1 and then resumed at the same dose or at the
next lower dose level if the toxicity was recurrent; for grade
3-4 toxicity, imatinib was withheld until resolution to
grade 1 and then resumed at the next lower dose level.
Imatinib was also held when the absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) was <0.5  109/L or platelets were <40 
109/L. Therapy was then resumed at the same dose level if
recovery (granulocytes >1  109/L or platelets >60 
109/L) occurred within 2 weeks or at the next lower dose
level if this occurred beyond 2 weeks. The lowest and
highest imatinib dose allowed were 300 mg/d and 800
mg/d. In patients with prior dose reductions, imatinib
could be dose-escalated if the patient remained free of toxicity requiring dose adjustments for at least 1 month.
Patients with dose reductions who did not achieve a molecular remission 6 months after randomization and had
no toxicities could have their dose escalated back to 400
mg twice daily.

GM-CSF

GM-CSF dose could be reduced by 1 dose level if
white blood cell (WBC) count was 20  109/L or escalated by 1 dose level if ANC was <0.5  109/L. For grade
3-4 nonhematologic toxicity related to GM-CSF, this was
discontinued until it resolved to grade 1 and then resumed
at the next lower dose level.
Patient Evaluation
Before the start of study treatment, all patients had a complete history taken and received a complete physical examination, a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive
biochemistry panel, a bone marrow (BM) aspirate with
cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH). A CBC with differential was obtained every 1 to
2 weeks for 4 weeks, every 4 to 6 weeks for the first 12
months of therapy, and every 3 to 4 months thereafter.
Total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate
aminotransferase, and creatinine were obtained every 2 to
4 weeks for 1 month, then every 4 to 6 weeks for the first
12 months of therapy, and every 3 to 4 months thereafter.
BM aspirate and cytogenetics (FISH, when cytogenetic
studies were unevaluable) were performed every 3 to 4
months for 1 year, then every 6 to 12 months during therapy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed every 3 for the first 12 months and every 6
months thereafter. BM and/or peripheral blood samples
with undetectable levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts were
confirmed by nested PCR as previously reported.5 Results
were expressed according to the international scale (IS).
Response criteria were as previously described.10 A major
molecular response was defined as a BCR-ABL1 IS transcript levels of 0.1%, and a complete molecular response
as undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript levels confirmed by
nested PCR.
Statistical Considerations
An accrual of 98 patients was initially planned. Assuming
randomization of 92 patients and a 1-sided significance
level of .05, the trial provided 80% power to detect a doubling in the rate of major molecular response. Patients
were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Arms A and B. The study
was designed to be stopped before 98 patients were
accrued if the probability of showing a significant benefit
for the combination arm (Arm B) over the high-dose imatinib arm (Arm A) was <5% or >95% by 12 months.
The chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to compare patient characteristics and response rates between
both treatment arms. Survival was estimated by the

574

Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.
OS was calculated from the start of high-dose imatinib to
the date of death from any cause or last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the start of
high-dose imatinib to unsatisfactory response (similar to
the European Leukemia Net recommendations for definition of failure), loss of complete cytogenetic response or
CHR, progression to AP or blast phase, or death. For calculation of EFS, events included failure to achieve major cytogenetic response by 12 months, treatment discontinuation
due to toxicity, loss of CHR, loss of major cytogenetic
response, increasing WBC count, death resulting from any
cause, or progression to AP or blast phase.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between May 2003 and July 2005, 94 patients with newly
diagnosed Philadelphia-positive chronic phase CML were
randomized to high-dose imatinib (Arm A; 49 patients)
or to high-dose imatinib with PEG IFN a-2b and GMCSF (Arm B; 45 patients) (Table 2). The median time
from CML diagnosis to randomization was 25 days
(range, 2-193 days). Fifteen (16%) patients had received
therapy with single-agent imatinib for a median of 16
days (range, 7-30 days). Thirty-two (34%) patients were
receiving hydroxyurea or anagrelide but discontinued
within 7 days of study entry. The median follow-up for all
patients was 54 months (range, 7-70 months).
Response and Outcome
Ninety-one (97%) of 94 patients have been followed for
3 months. One patient in Arm A (lost to follow-up) and
2 in Arm B (1 for noncompliance, 1 for treatment refusal)
were taken off study before the 3-month first cytogenetic
assessment. In addition, in Arm B, 11 (24%) patients
were noncompliant with PEG IFN a-2b. Table 3 summarizes the reported response rates. CHR was achieved in 89
(95%) patients, whereas complete cytogenetic response
and partial cytogenetic response were attained in 82
(90%) and 3 (3%) patients, respectively. Seventy-eight
(91%) of 86 evaluable patients achieved major cytogenetic
response at 12 months, including 76 (88%) with complete cytogenetic response. The rates of major cytogenetic
response, complete cytogenetic response, and partial cytogenetic response were 90%, 89%, and 1% at 24 months
(82 patients evaluable) and 89%, 89%, and 0% at 30
months (81 patients evaluable), respectively. Overall cytogenetic responses by arm were as follows: 44 (92%) of 48

Toxicity
The most frequent nonhematologic toxicities for the total
population were fatigue (n ¼ 79, 87%), periorbital edema
(n ¼ 67, 74%), diarrhea (n ¼ 65, 71%), nausea (n ¼ 64,
70%), and peripheral edema (n ¼ 61, 67%) (Table 4).
Toxicities during the first 6 months of therapy were similar to those reported in prior studies of high-dose imatinib
and comparable between the 2 arms.2,3 In Arm A, highdose imatinib-related toxicity declined significantly after
6 months of therapy. Higher rates of fatigue (59%), fever
(51%), influenza-like syndrome (36%), rash (31%),
injection site reaction (31%), myalgia (28%), pruritus
(28%), and depression (18%) were reported after the
addition of PEG IFN a-2b and GM-CSF in Arm B when
compared with Arm A. Grade 3-4 toxicities in Arm B
were mainly fatigue (31%), headache (10%), and diarrhea
(8%). Only 6 patients developed grade 3-4 toxicity in
Arm A, with the most frequent being peripheral edema
(4%) and elevated liver enzymes (4%). After 6 months,
significant differences were observed in the incidence of
neutropenia grade 3-4 (4% vs 12%), and thrombocytopenia of any grade (8% vs 20%) between both arms.
Eleven (24%) and 12 (27%) of the 45 patients
treated in Arm B never started therapy with PEG IFN a2b or GM-CSF, respectively. The main reasons were

Dose Intensity
Because toxicity precluded the administration of the
planned treatment in some patients, we determined the
intensity of therapy delivered in both arms. The median
duration on high-dose imatinib in Arm A was 48 months
(range, 1-68 months) and the median number of days off
imatinib therapy was 7 (range, 0-200 days). The median
imatinib dose intensity in Arm A was 93% (range, 46%100%). Twenty-five (51%) of 49 patients received 90%
to 100% of the planned imatinib dose, 16 (33%) received
70% to 89%, and 8 (16%) received 0% to 69%. Seventeen (35%) of 49 patients had to reduce imatinib dose to

400 mg for a median of 392 days (range, 1-1347 days).
In contrast, the median time on high-dose imatinib
among patients in Arm B was 44 months (range, 1-70
months), and the median time off imatinib was 16 days
(range, 0-306 days). Imatinib dose intensity in Arm B was
92% (range, 45%-100%). Twenty-five (56%) of 45
patients received 90% to 100% of the planned imatinib
dose, 9 (20%) received 70% to 89%, and 11 (24%)
received 0% to 69%. Twenty (44%) of 45 patients had to
reduce the dose to 400 mg or lower for a median number
of 117 days (range, 2-1653 days).
The median time on PEG IFN a-2b therapy for the
34 (76%) patients in Arm B who received this agent was
335 days (range, 7-1191 days), the median time off PEG
IFN a therapy 14 days (range, 0-118 days), and the median time that PEG IFN a-2b had to be dose-reduced was
38 days (range, 0-1105 days). Patients received GM-CSF
for a median time of 249 days (range, 1-1234 days), which
was interrupted for a median of 10 days (range, 0-96
days).

DISCUSSION
The poor efficacy of imatinib in rendering complete molecular response has been linked to the inherent resistance
of CML stem cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.21 A
mathematical tetra-compartmental model postulates that
CML cells are hierarchically organized into leukemic
stem cells (with limitless ability to self-renew), leukemic
progenitor cells (devoid of self-renewal capacity), differentiated leukemic cells (evolving toward specialized cell
types), and terminally differentiated cells.22 Imatinib
induces an initial dramatic decrease in BCR-ABL transcripts (5% per day), reflecting the rapid depletion of
mature differentiated and terminally differentiated cells
and a slower (0.8% per day) gradual turnover of leukemic progenitor cells.22 However, CML stem cells remain
unaffected, in keeping with the observation that Philadelphia-positive CD34þ cells, colony-forming cells, and
long-term culture-initiating cells can be readily isolated
even after the achievement of complete cytogenetic
response.23,24 BCR-ABL–expressing CD34þ/Lin leukemic stem cells obtained from patients with CML in
chronic phase remained quiescent but viable even in the
presence of growth factors and imatinib,8 providing a reservoir for the generation and expansion of imatinib-resistant mutant clones.25
The mechanism of action of IFN a involves restoration of the adhesion of leukemic stem cells to marrow

578

stroma, down-regulation of BCR-ABL expression, activation of transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis,26-30 and generation of
dendritic cells that can present CML-specific antigens and
enhance the immune recognition and elimination of leukemic cells.18 Importantly, IFN a has been recently
shown to activate dormant hematopoietic stem cells by
facilitating their transition from a quiescent G0 phase to
an active cell cycle state,31 whereas imatinib would act on
more differentiated leukemic cells, thus suggesting that
IFN a may sensitize (prime) CML cells to imatinib therapy. Therapy with imatinib 400 mg/d in combination
with variable weekly doses of PEG IFN a-2b (50 lg, 100
lg, or 150 lg) given to 76 patients with untreated chronic
phase CML rendered major cytogenetic response and
complete cytogenetic response rates of 83% and 70%,
respectively, and 68% of patients with a complete cytogenetic response also achieved major molecular response.32
Forty-five (59%) patients discontinued PEG IFN a-2b
therapy, and the median administered dose ranged from
32 lg to 36 lg weekly. The recently reported SPIRIT
study randomized patients with CML in early chronic
phase to receive standard-dose imatinib, high-dose imatinib (600 mg/d), imatinib þ cytarabine, or imatinib þ
PEG IFN a-2a.33 At 18 months, the PEG IFN a-2a–containing combination rendered the highest rate of major
molecular response (62%) compared with standard-dose
(41%) or high-dose imatinib (52%), as well as the highest
rate of BCR/ABL1 transcript levels (IS) 0.1% (36%)
compared with 19% to 25% in the other arms.33 In the
present study, however, no differences in major molecular
response rates were observed on addition of PEG IFN a2a to high-dose imatinib. Several differences between the
2 studies could explain these discrepancies. First, in the
SPIRIT trial, PEG IFN a-2a was initiated from the start
of therapy, whereas in our study this was added after 6
months of single-agent high-dose imatinib. Second, PEG
IFN a-2a was used in the French study, whereas we
employed PEG IFN a-2b. Third, in our study, patients
received high-dose imatinib together with PEG IFN a2b, whereas in the SPIRIT trial patients receiving the
combination used standard-dose imatinib. It is possible
that when using high-dose imatinib, the addition of PEG
IFN a may add little to the response rate. Finally, in our
study, GM-CSF was used in addition to PEG IFN a-2b.
The possibility that the concomitant use of this growth
factor counteracted the potential benefit of interferon
should be entertained. However, it is still possible that
PEG IFN a-2b may prolong response duration, although
Cancer

such effect has not been seen in our study after a median
follow-up of 54 months.
Several factors may have accounted for the nonsuperiority of the combination arm. First, although the imatinib
dose intensity between arms was virtually identical (93% vs
92%), the overall treatment intensity in the combination
arm was significantly handicapped, because 11 (24%) of the
45 patients did not start PEG IFN a-2b. Second, 32% of
patients receiving PEG IFN a-2b discontinued therapy
within 12 months due to toxicity. Thus, only 23 (51%) of
45 patients randomized to receive combination therapy at 6
months were actually receiving PEG IFN a-2b at 12
months. In the SPIRIT trial, 45% of patients have also discontinued PEG IFN a-2a by 12 months.33 Third, treatment-related toxicity required the discontinuation of GMCSF in 25 (56%) patients by 12 months. Thus, in all
patients randomized to Arm B, the intended treatment
approach eventually failed as determined by the inability to
continue the combination therapy (although most continued imatinib as a single agent). However, analyzing only
those patients who received 6 months of PEG IFN a-2b,
we still did not observe a difference in response rate or longterm outcome (data not shown).
In summary, the combination of high-dose imatinib
with PEG IFN a-2b and GM-CSF has not impacted significantly the achievement of cytogenetic or major molecular response after 12 months of therapy at the dose
schedule employed in the present study. The high dropout rate observed in the combination arm due to toxicity
may have compromised any potential benefit from the
proposed immune modulation. These results should be
considered in the future design of more efficacious and
tolerable therapies targeting minimal residual disease that
may lead to the cure for CML.
