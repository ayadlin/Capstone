BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is effective in gastric cancer treatment, but with severe dose-dependent
toxicities. A novel prodrug of doxorubicin (Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM) is designed to deliver free doxorubicin relying
on cathepsin B and reduce side effects. The authors examined the antitumor effect and toxicities of Ac-PheLys-PABC-ADM against gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis. METHODS: SGC-7901 gastric cancer cell line was
used for the study. The in vitro study investigated the effects of doxorubicin and Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM on cell
growth dynamics and cell cycle. The in vivo study investigated the efficacy and toxicity of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM
on a nude mice model of peritoneal carcinomatosis, with doxorubicin as positive control. RESULTS: In the in vitro
study, Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM had a lower dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SGC-7901 cells. In the in vivo study of
control, doxorubicin, and Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM groups, the median experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis
indexes were 6, 1.5, and 1, respectively (P ¼ .004); the body weights were 24.32  1.40 g, 18.40  2.97 g, and 23.61 
0.80 g, respectively (P ¼ .000). Biochemical studies showed that Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM had significantly lower
toxicities on the bone marrow, liver, kidney, and particularly heart. Histopathological studies of the control, doxorubicin, and Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM groups found significant myocardium toxicities in 3, 7, and 4 animals, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM could be an effective molecular targeting drug to treat gastric cancer peritoneal

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer (GC) is among the most common malignancies in developing countries, where it ranks second in terms
of incidence rate and third in terms of mortality rate among the male population, and ranks fourth in terms of both incidence rate and mortality rate among the female population, according to the most recent global statistics.1 GC is also the
third leading cause of cancer mortality in China,2 where >80% of GC has already become clinically advanced by the time
of surgical exploration, so that curative treatment is no longer possible.3 It has long been recognized that GC tends to have
lymphatic, hematogenous, or intra-abdominal metastasis because of its pathophysiological heterogeneity. To some extent,
extended lymphadenectomy, regional radiotherapy, and adjuvant antitumor chemotherapy could prolong overall survival.
This has been proven by some large-scale international studies, including the INT-0116 trial, the MAGIC trial, and the

ACTS-GC trial.4-6 However, these studies also show that
regardless of whether patients receive surgery alone or surgery combined with perioperative or postoperative chemoradiotherapy, locoregional recurrence, especially
abdominal metastasis, is the most common pattern of cancer recurrence.
GC is prone to intra-abdominal metastasis, mainly
because of free cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity. Free
GC cells in peritoneal lavage fluid are detected in up to
24% of stage IB and 40% of stage II or III GC patients.7
Peritoneum seeded with free cancer cells forming peritoneal
carcinomatosis is a characteristic feature of GC spread. As a
result, >30% of advanced GC patients have developed
peritoneal carcinomatosis when diagnosed, and 60% of all
GC patients die of peritoneal carcinomatosis.8,9
During the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis, GC cells secret enzymes to facilitate cancer cells seeding and colonization on the peritoneum. Cathepsin B is
among the key enzymes in this critical process, overexpressed in GC as well as other cancers,10-12 and actively
involved in cancer invasion.13-15 Conversely, its expression is extremely low in normal cells, and it is inactive or
loses activity as soon as it is dispersed in aqueous media
away from cells.16 Thus, cathepsin B has long been considered a candidate target in cancer therapy.17
It was established in the MAGIC trial that the
anthracycline-contained regimen is a useful chemotherapy
for GC.5 Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is a typical representative of anthracyclines. Although doxorubicin is an
important drug in chemotherapy, its toxicities are also
well known, such as cardiac toxicities and bone marrow
suppression. To retain the therapeutic effect while reducing the side effects, we designed a smart prodrug of doxorubicin, Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM (Fig. 1A).18-20 In this
modified doxorubicin, Phe-Lys is a dipeptide specific for
cathepsin B, and PABC (para-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl)
is a self-immolative spacer. The prodrug is inactive when
there is little cathepsin B activity, such as in normal tissues
and peripheral blood, thus avoiding the side effects on
normal tissue. During cancer invasion, activated cathepsin
B is overexpressed on the exterior membrane of the invading cancer cells, which cleaves the Phe-Lys dipeptide at
the Lys-PABC bond. Then the exposed PABC spacer can
self-hydrolyze upon deacylation, and free doxorubicin
molecules are released, resulting in direct killing of the
invading cancer cells.
The in vitro release study of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM showed that the half-life of doxorubicin release at
37 C was 16 minutes in cathepsin B solution, but no

changes were observed over 6 to 7 hours in human
plasma.18 However, the prodrug has not yet been evaluated in a real life cancer model. This in vitro and in vivo
study was to evaluate this prodrug for targeted treatment
of peritoneal carcinomatosis from GC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Agents and Cells
Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM was synthesized (by Y.-P.H.)
according to the previously reported chemical process.18-20
The molecular weight of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM
hydrochloride is 1045.50. In terms of equivalent mole
content, 1.8 mg Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM hydrochloride
is equivalent to 1 mg doxorubicin hydrochloride (molecular weight, 579.99). Other agents were obtained commercially, including Doxorubicin Hydrochloride for
Injection (Pharmacia, Milan, Italy), RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, Utah) and standard newborn
bovine serum (Zhengzhou Ben BioTech, Zhengzhou,
China) for cell culture, propidium iodine (PI) agents kit
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif) for flow cytometric
analysis, rabbit anticathepsin B polyclonal antibody
(Lot No.3190-100; BioVision, Mountain View, Calif),
and peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat antirabbit
IgG (H þ L) (Lot No.88,813; Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, Pa) for immunohistochemical study. The
human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC-7901 was
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
standard newborn bovine serum in the 5% CO2, saturated
humidity, 37 C incubator (Shel Lab, Cornelius, Ore).
Animals
Male BALB/c nude mice, 5 to 6 weeks old, were from
Beijing HFK Bio-Technology (Beijing, China; animal
quality certificate No. SCXK[Jing] 2009-0004) and
maintained in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory at
the Animal Experimental Center of Wuhan University.
After 3 days of adaptation, the animals were used for in
vivo study, and the protocols were approved by the animal
care committee of Wuhan University.
In Vitro Cell Growth and Cell Cycle Study
SGC-7901 cells at exponential growth phase were planted
in 24-well culture plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at a
density of 1  105/well. After 48 hours, cell numbers
were determined by direct cell counting of 3 wells, which
was designated as cell number of day 1. Then the
cells were divided into 6 groups, treated with normal
saline (100 lL), doxorubicin (0.5 lg/mL), doxorubicin

2988

(1.0 lg/mL), Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM (0.9 lg/mL),
Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM (1.8 lg/mL), and Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM (3.6 lg/mL), respectively, at 3 wells per group.
Cells in each group were harvested and counted daily from
day 2 to day 7. The cell growth curve was plotted.
For cell cycle study, SGC-7901 cells at exponential
growth phase were treated for 24 hours with normal saline
(25 lL), doxorubicin (0.25 lg/mL), and Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM (0.45 lg/mL). The cells were treated after a
standard protocol and stained with PI kit. Cell cycle
analysis was performed by flow cytometry with FC 500
(Beckman Coulter).
In Vivo Pilot Dosage Study
Because this was the first animal study, it was necessary to
establish a workable dose range. Therefore, we first performed a pilot dosage study on 4 nude mice, which were
divided into groups A (n ¼ 2) and B (n ¼ 2). The
reported median lethal dose (LD50) of doxorubicin was
13.2 mg/kg when given intraperitoneally (i.p.)21 and
12.0 mg/kg when given intravenously for mice.22
Therefore, we performed this tentative study based
on these dosages. For group A, we used 24.0 mg/kg of
Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM, which is equivalent to the
LD50 of doxorubicin for i.p. injection. The dosage of
group B (36.0 mg/kg) was 1.5 higher than that of group
A. The mice were observed daily, and body weight
was recorded every 3 days. If the status of mice was stable
in 7 days, additional administrations were given. After 4
consecutive administrations, the mice showed signs of
toxicity. They were sacrificed, and the heart, liver, and
kidney were obtained for histopathology study. The blood
was used for biochemical studies, including cardiac,
hepatic, and renal functions.
In Vivo Efficacy Study
SGC-7901 cells (5  106/0.2 mL per mouse) were
injected i.p. into 29 nude mice on day 0. On day 8, the
mice were randomized into 3 groups: control group (normal saline 10 mL/kg, i.p., n ¼ 9), doxorubicin group
(doxorubicin 2.0 mg/kg, i.p., n ¼ 10), and Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM group (Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM 7.2 mg/
kg, i.p., n ¼ 10). Treatment was conducted on days 8, 12,
16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36, respectively. The total dosages
were based on a previous report23 and the above pilot dosage study. The mice were observed daily, and body weight
was recorded every 4 days. On day 40, all animals were euthanized, and autopsy was conducted. An experimental
peritoneal carcinomatosis index system was developed to

evaluate the efficacy that took into consideration tumor
nodule sizes, distributions, and the characteristics of ascites. In this system, the abdominal cavity of the mouse was
divided into 4 regions: region I, subdiaphragm; region II,
the liver, spleen, stomach, and affiliated ligaments; region
III, small intestine, colon, mesenterium, and abdominal
wall; and region IV, pelvic cavity, urogenital system, and
rectum. The detailed scoring criteria were modified from
a similar reporting system on a rat peritoneal carcinomatosis model24 and set as follows: score 0, no tumor nodules
throughout the region; score 1, nodule size 2 mm in
greatest diameter; score 2, nodule size >2 mm and up to
5 mm; score 3, nodule size >5 mm. If bloody ascites
occurred, it was set as score 1. The sum of all the scores
was the experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis index of
the animal (ranging from 0 to 13).
Toxicities Study
Potential toxicities to major organ systems were evaluated.
On days 16, 24, and 32 of the efficacy study, 80 lL of
blood was obtained from tail veins for routine hematological study by Sysmex KX-21 automated hematology
analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). On day 40, blood

Cancer

was collected for biochemical study, including alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase,
blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatine kinase, creatine
kinase-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase by Aeroset Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
Ill). At autopsy, major organs including the heart, liver,
kidneys, spleen, and lungs were examined for any toxic
changes. Any organs involved by the tumor and the tumor
nodules were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut
at 5 lm thickness for histopathological study after hematoxylin and eosin staining.
Immunohistochemical Study
To determine the cathepsin B level in this tumor model,
we performed immunohistochemical studies on tumor
tissue from control mice, after the detailed procedure
developed in our group.25
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed on SPSS software version 13.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). The differences in body weight
and blood routine among different groups were tested
using analysis of variance at each time point, and the

the least significant difference test. Because of the small
sample size, the experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis

RESULTS
Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM Showed Lower
Inhibition on Cell Growth and Cell Cycle
In Vitro
As shown in Figure 1B, both doxorubicin and Ac-PheLys-PABC-ADM could inhibit cell growth in a dose-dependent fashion, compared with control. At the endpoint
(day 7), the inhibition rates of doxorubicin (0.5 lg/mL),
doxorubicin (1.0 lg/mL), Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM (0.9
lg/mL), Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM (1.8 lg/mL), and AcPhe-Lys-PABC-ADM (3.6 lg/mL) were 80.2%, 96.3%,
38.0%, 33.0%, and 62.3%, respectively. Figure 1C shows
that doxorubicin had a significant effect on the cell cycle.
In doxorubicin-treated cells, a prominent apoptosis peak
was observed. In comparison, Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADMtreated cells did not show significant apoptosis, and
the DNA content distribution was similar to that of the
control group.
Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM Had Higher Maximum
Tolerated Dose
In the pilot dosage study, the actual total dosage delivered
was 96.0 mg/kg for group A and 144.0 mg/kg for group
B. There were no obvious changes in body weight among
all the 4 animals for the first 3 injections. After the fourth
administration (36.0 mg/kg for group A and 54.0 mg/kg
for group B), however, persistent body weight decreases
were observed. On the basis of these results, we set the
ceiling dosage of <96.0 mg/kg for the formal in vivo test.
No obvious damages were observed according to
histopathological study of major organs. The maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM is
>4 higher than that of doxorubicin.
Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM Retained a Better
Antitumor Effect Than Doxorubicin
In the full-scale study, the actual total dosage of Ac-PheLys-PABC-ADM (57.6 mg/kg) was 2 that of doxorubicin (16 mg/kg) in terms of equal mole content. As
shown in Figure 2, both Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM and
doxorubicin reduced the experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis index compared with control. The median
(range) experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis index
scores were 6 (1-10) for the control group, 1.5 (0-6) for
the doxorubicin group, and 1 (1-4) for the Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM group, respectively (Fig. 2A, B; P ¼ .004;
doxorubicin vs control, P ¼ .008; Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM vs control, P ¼ .003). Lung metastasis was found in
1 nude mouse in the control groups (Fig. 2C), but there

was no lung metastasis in any mouse of the Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM and doxorubicin groups.
Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM Maintained Better
General Status and Reduced General Toxicity
In terms of general status and body weight, Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM had significantly less negative impact
(Fig. 3). The body weight of the doxorubicin group
showed significant decrease on day 24, and the drop
became increasingly prominent thereafter. Conversely,
the body weight of the Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM group
was similar to that of the control group throughout the
whole study period.
The hematological effects of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM and doxorubicin are shown in Table 1. Of particular note is the consistent drop in red blood cells and lymphocytes across all 3 time points. The doxorubicin group
had significantly lower red blood cell and lymphocyte
counts than the control and the Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM
groups. Conversely, there were no differences between the

Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM Reduced Toxicities to
Liver, Kidney, and Particularly Heart
As shown in Figure 4, both Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM and
doxorubicin had adverse effects on liver and kidney functions. For Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM, among the 4 major
parameters studied, only ALT levels achieved statistical
significance between the Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM and
control groups. For doxorubicin, however, 3 of the 4 parameters achieved statistical significance between the doxorubicin and control groups. Histopathological study
confirmed that Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM reduced liver
and renal toxicities.
Potential cardiac toxicity was also studied in greater
detail, as shown in Figure 5. Histopathological studies
found significant myocardium toxicities in 3, 7, and 4 animals in the control, doxorubicin, and Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM groups, respectively. The Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM
group has significantly lower myocardium toxicities than
the doxorubicin group.

Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM Works via the
Cathepsin B Pathway
As shown in Figure 6, prominent cathepsin B expression
was observed in tumor cells, suggesting that Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM works via the cathepsin B pathway.

DISCUSSION
In the multidisciplinary treatment of GC, chemotherapy
plays an important role, because meta-analysis has shown
that adjuvant chemotherapy could reduce the risk of death
and improve overall survival for GC.27,28 In currently
available chemotherapeutic regimens, anthracyclines are
important drugs, as is well demonstrated in the MAGIC
trial.4,29,30 Anthracyclines cause cell damage by intercalating into DNA, leading to chromatin unfolding and aggregation, which ultimately results in apoptosis.31
However, like many cytotoxic agents, anthracyclines
can cause serious organ damage. With doxorubicin, toxicity to the heart and bone marrow are usually dose limiting,
with the MTD far below the minimum curative dose.
Therefore, strategies to shield the heart and marrow by
excluding doxorubicin from them have long been a top

priority. Another strategy has been to target the drug to
the tumor by attaching it to some tumor-binding moiety,
for example, a tumor-specific monoclonal antibody
(MoAb) such as trastuzumab used in chemotherapy for
human epidermal growth receptor 2-positive GC.32
Drawbacks to the use of MoAbs have been that 1) the tumor Ag that binds the MoAb is never completely tumor
specific, so that some of the drug goes where it does harm;
2) foreign MoAbs are often immunogenic; and 3) MoAb
therapy is very expensive.
In the present study, normal organs are protected by
masking the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin with a simple
dipeptide that renders it nontoxic. At the tumor, the mask
is removed by cathepsin B, a ubiquitous proteolytic
enzyme that is so destructive to tissue that normally it
occurs only within cells, encased in lysosomes. Only tumor cells secrete cathepsin B externally, confined to their
plasma membranes, for the purpose of penetrating basement membrane and extracellular barriers as they spread.
The prodrug Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM is rapidly cleaved
by cathepsin B at the Lys-PABC bond. The resulting
PABC-doxorubicin decomposes at once to para-aminobenzyl alcohol, CO2, and free doxorubicin. The PABC
self-immolating linker33 is necessary because the cathepsin

molecule, but the smaller PABC fits into the active site.
Free doxorubicin released right on the cancer cells
penetrates them readily, killing them. To be sure, a certain
portion of the free drug may drift away from the tumor,
but the concentration ratio tumor/heart-bone marrow
should be much higher than if the doxorubicin is given as
the free drug, when the expected ratio is about 1. In this
way, even without a positive targeting agent like a MoAb,
it is possible to raise the MTD without significantly raising the minimum curative dose. The goal is to raise the
MTD above the minimum curative dose, where cures
become possible, but even short of that, a rise in the
MTD/minimum curative dose ratio will enhance the
effect.
This is the first study to systematically evaluate the
in vitro and in vivo efficacy and side effects of Ac-PheLys-PABC-ADM. The predominant in vitro finding was
that doxorubicin and Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM had dosedependent effects on cell growth, and that Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM could retard cell growth. In terms of pure
doxorubicin content, an equal amount of Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM inhibits cell growth less than doxorubicin
itself. This suggests that 1) cells in vitro do not produce

much external cathepsin B, so Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM
is not converted to doxorubicin; and 2) Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM affects cell metabolism through a mechanism different from that of doxorubicin. Indeed, our flow
cytometry study revealed that Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM
mainly blocked the cell cycle at phase S. In comparison,
there was a significant apoptosis peak in the doxorubicintreated cells, suggesting that Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM
inhibits cell growth by a cytostatic mechanism, but doxorubicin by a cytotoxic mechanism.
There are 2 requirements this program must meet:
first, the masking group must be somatically stable, to
prevent inappropriate release of free doxorubicin in nontumor locales; second, the release of free doxorubicin at
the tumor must be fast enough to kill cancer cells. Both
these requirements had been met in vitro, but not yet
demonstrated in vivo.

2994

We have now found that Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM is indeed both stable and effective in vivo. Free
doxorubicin produced toxicity in the mice, evidenced
by weight loss beginning on day 20, which was not seen
in either the control or Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM groups
up to day 40. This shows that the amount of free
doxorubicin released from Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM
by hydrolysis outside the tumor was small if any. However, although somatically stable, Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM released free doxorubicin efficiently at the tumor,
with antitumor power equivalent to that of free
doxorubicin.
All animals in the control group developed clinically significant peritoneal carcinomatosis, with tumor
nodules seeding on the abdominal wall, diaphragm, liver
capsule, small intestine surface, and mesenterium. Prominent angiogenesis was also observed in the abdominal
tumor nodules. All these testify to the success of our
model system. To more objectively evaluate efficacy, we
established an experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis
index system, similar to a clinical peritoneal carcinomatosis index system developed by Portilla et al34 and several rat experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis index
systems.24 Compared with control, Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM and doxorubicin reduced the experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis index by 83.3% (5 of 6) and 75%
(4.5 of 6), respectively. The results also suggest that AcPhe-Lys-PABC-ADM may have better antitumor
effect than doxorubicin in this model system, where the
dosage of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM was twice that of
doxorubicin.
Also encouraging is the finding that the antitumor
efficacy of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM was accompanied by
significantly better general status, blood profiles, and
organ system tolerability. Animals in the Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM group maintained body weight throughout
the study similar to those in the control group (23.61 
0.80 g vs 24.32  1.40 g), whereas there was significant
body weight reduction in the doxorubicin group beginning at the halfway point (18.40  2.97 g; Fig. 3). In
terms of the routine peripheral blood test, both Ac-PheLys-PABC-ADM and doxorubicin had a negative effect
on bone marrow function. However, Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM had a much smaller impact on red blood cells and
lymphocytes than doxorubicin (Table 1). Thus, the masking group apparently made Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM less
toxic to the hemopoietic system. Biochemical studies also
indicated that Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM had smaller toxicities to major organs such as the liver, the kidneys, and

particularly the heart. In addition, histopathology showed
prominent tissue structure and cell morphology changes,
in agreement with these biochemical alterations. All these
results indicate that the toxicity of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABCADM is much reduced by the Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC masking
group.
To test whether Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM achieved
its effects via the cathepsin B pathway, we performed immunohistochemical studies, which clearly showed that the
SGC-7901 tumor indeed produced a large amount of cathepsin B. As was previously shown,18 Ac-Phe-LysPABC-ADM was stable in human plasma, but rapidly
cleaved in cathepsin B-rich medium. We can conclude
with reasonable confidence that in this animal model system, Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM inhibited peritoneal carcinomatosis development and progression through the
cathepsin B mechanism.
Apart from the promising results, this study also has
limitations. First, it focused on only a single model system, which did not reveal the entire antitumor spectrum
of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM. Different model systems of
gastric cancer could help evaluate this prodrug more
extensively. Other solid tumors with high cathepsin B
expression are also potential targets for this prodrug. Second, pharmacological and pharmacodynamic studies have
not yet been completely conducted, even in this model
system. As this study is an initial experiment primarily
focused on in vivo efficacy, we assigned lower priority to
pharmacologic and metabolic studies. Although the current in vivo dosage produced good results, the LD50 and
optimal dosages are yet to be found. Third, the study suggests that Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM might have mechanisms of action yet unknown, different from those of
doxorubicin.
In conclusion, this study is the first to systematically
evaluate Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-ADM in any animal model
(peritoneal carcinomatosis). The results suggest that AcPhe-Lys-PABC-ADM is a promising prodrug with better
antitumor efficacy and much reduced toxicities.
