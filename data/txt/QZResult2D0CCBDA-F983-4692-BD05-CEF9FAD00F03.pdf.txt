BACKGROUND: Epigenetic therapy has had a significant impact on the management of hematologic malignancies,
but its role in the treatment of ovarian cancer remains to be defined. The authors previously demonstrated that treatment of ovarian and breast cancer cells with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can
up-regulate the expression of imprinted tumor suppressors. In this study, demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors
were tested for their ability to induce re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, inhibiting growth of ovarian cancer
cells in culture and in xenografts. METHODS: Ovarian cancer cells (Hey and SKOv3) were treated with demethylating
agents (5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine [DAC] or 5-azacitidine [AZA]) or with HDAC inhibitors (suberoylanilide hydroxamic
acid [SAHA] or trichostatin A [TSA]) to determine their impact on cellular proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, autophagy, and re-expression of 2 growth inhibitory imprinted tumor suppressor genes: guanosine triphosphatebinding Di-RAS-like 3 (ARHI) and paternally expressed 3 (PEG3). The in vivo activities of DAC and SAHA were
assessed in a Hey xenograft model. RESULTS: The combination of DAC and SAHA produced synergistic inhibition of
Hey and SKOv3 cell growth by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. DAC induced autophagy in Hey cells that was
enhanced by SAHA. Treatment with both agents induced re-expression of ARHI and PEG3 in cultured cells and in
xenografts, correlating with growth inhibition. Knockdown of ARHI decreased DAC-induced autophagy. DAC and
SAHA inhibited the growth of Hey xenografts and induced autophagy in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of DAC
and SAHA inhibited ovarian cancer growth while inducing apoptosis, G2/M arrest, autophagy, and re-expression of

Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States and has the highest fatalityto-case ratio.1 Despite advances in surgery and chemotherapy, the cure rate is <30% for advanced stage ovarian cancer,2
underscoring the urgent need for more effective therapy based on a better understanding of the biology of the disease.

Combined Activity of DAC and SAHA/Chen et al

Molecular mechanisms underlying the development
and progression of ovarian cancer remain poorly understood. Genetic alterations have been detected in different
ovarian cancers with activating mutations and amplification of oncogenes as well as inactivating mutations and
loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes.3
Epigenetic changes also have been implicated in
malignant transformation and progression of different
cancers, including ovarian cancer.4 Aberrant DNA
methylation in the CpG islands within promoter
regions is associated with silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which is considered equivalent to the effect
of inactivating mutations or deletion of tumor suppressor genes.5 Aberrant DNA methylation can be
reversed with hypomethylating agents, such as 5-azacitidine (AZA), and 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (decitabine;
DAC).5,6 Re-expression of genes that inhibit growth,
promote apoptosis, and induce autophagy could exert
antitumor activity. Although significant therapeutic
activity has been reported in patients with hematopoietic malignancies,7 few trials have been performed
in solid tumors, including ovarian cancer. Recent
studies with AZA suggest that re-expression of
silenced genes can be achieved and that sensitivity to
carboplatin can be restored in a fraction of patients
with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.8
Epigenetic regulation of tumor suppressor genes
also occurs through histone modification. Acetylation
of histones H3 and H4 is associated with active gene
transcription, whereas deacetylation represses gene
expression. These changes are catalyzed by histone
acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAC).
Several compounds, including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and trichostatin A (TSA), inhibit
HDAC activity and can induce global and genespecific hyperacetylation, enhancing the expression of
numerous genes. It has been demonstrated that these
compounds can inhibit cancer growth in different
preclinical models, and they are being evaluated in
clinical trials with SAHA (vorinostat) for treating
patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.9,10 When it
was used as a single agent in platinum-refractory ovarian cancer, SAHA was well tolerated but had minimal
activity.11 A recent phase 1b-2a study to assess the
effects of hypomethylating agent azacitidine in patients
with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory epithelial ovarian cancer indicated that treatment with a
hypomethylating agent could partially reverse platinum
resistance.8

Combined use of demethylating agents and HDAC
inhibitors have achieved greater antitumor activity12,13;
however, the mechanisms underlying their activity are
not well defined but may relate to the up-regulation of
growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic genes that have
been silenced during oncogenesis by hypermethylation and histone deacetylation. Although both growthinhibitory and growth-stimulatory genes may be
up-regulated by these inhibitors, it is believed that tumor
progression during oncogenesis involves the silencing of
tumor suppressor genes in excess of oncogenes. Thus,
growth-inhibitory genes may be up-regulated preferentially by treatment with demethylating agents and
HDAC inhibitors. Early clinical trials have demonstrated that demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors
can be administered together at effective doses to treat
hematologic malignancies.13
Several putative tumor suppressor genes are
imprinted and expressed from only a single, nonimprinted allele in normal cells. In our previous studies, we
identified 7 imprinted tumor suppressor genes that are
down-regulated in ovarian cancers.14 Among these genes,
guanosine triphosphate-binding Di-RAS-like 3 (ARHI)
and paternally expressed 3 (PEG3) are the most markedly
down-regulated with reduced expression in approximately
63% to 88% and 75% of ovarian cancers, respectively.15,16 ARHI and PEG3 can be down-regulated by
loss of heterozygosity or can be silenced by promoter
hypermethylation of both alleles.16 In addition, ARHI
expression is down-regulated transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally in ovarian cancer cells.17 Re-expression
of ARHI can be achieved in cancer cells by treatment
with AZA and TSA that, in combination, can stimulate
transcription from both the imprinted and nonimprinted alleles.18 Re-expression of ARHI and PEG3
strongly inhibit clonogenic growth of ovarian cancers.16
Re-expression of ARHI causes autophagic death of
cultured human ovarian cancer cells and induces tumor
dormancy in xenografts.19 Autophagy is characterized by
the accumulation of multilamellar vacuoles that engulf
cytoplasm and organelles, forming autophagosomes
marked by microtubule-associated protein light chain 3
(MAP-LC3). Autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes,
releasing their contents for hydrolysis, which can temporarily sustain energy production by stressed cells but can
prove lethal if prolonged.20
In the current study, we measured the antiproliferative activity of 2 demethylating agents (DAC and AZA)
and 2 HDAC inhibitors (SAHA and TSA) individually

and in combination against human Hey and SKOv3
ovarian cancer cells. To identify mechanisms underlying
growth inhibition, we measured changes in cell cycle,
apoptosis, and autophagy. We have tested the hypothesis
that growth inhibition would be associated with
re-expression of growth-inhibitory tumor suppressor
genes, including ARHI and PEG3, and that these genes
might be used as biomarkers for effective dosing of
demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors in cell
culture and in xenografts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and Cells
AZA (Pharmion Corp., Boulder, Colo), and DAC
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo) were dissolved in distilled
water. TSA (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol.
SAHA was synthesized according to Gediva et al21 and
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The characterization of
SAHA is in agreement with the reference, and the purity
is >95% based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640
medium (Hey cells) or McCoy 5A medium (SKOv3 cells)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mM
L-glutamine, 100 lg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL
penicillin. The identity of both cell lines was confirmed
by DNA satellite signature analysis.
Cell Growth Assays
The growth of Hey and SKOv3 cells was evaluated by sulforhodamin B (SRB) staining as described previously.19
Briefly, Hey cells (1.5  103) and SKOv3 cells (2  103)
were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates for 24 hours and
treated with DAC, AZA, SAHA, and TSA individually or
in combination with serial, 2-fold dilutions of the 2
agents. Culture media were changed daily with freshly
added inhibitors. Cells were harvested on Day 5 for SRB
assays, and the values were normalized to untreated
controls.
RNA Extraction and Real-Time Reverse
Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Expression of ARHI and PEG3 was measured using
real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction, as described previously.16 The primers
for ARHI and PEG3 were purchased from Applied
Biosystems (Foster City, Calif). Relative levels of
ARHI and PEG3 messenger RNA (mRNA) were normalized to a concurrent determination for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. All samples

4426

were measured in triplicate, and each experiment was
repeated twice.
Measurement of Apoptosis Induction
Cultured cells were treated with DAC, SAHA, or
both agents combined for 5 consecutive days without
changing the medium. Caspase 3 and 7 activities were
measured using the Caspase-Glo 3 of 7 Assay (Promega,
Madison, Wis).
Cell Cycle Analysis
Cells were grown for 24 hours and treated with DAC,
SAHA, or their combination for 1 day, 3 days, or 5 days.
Cell viability was assessed by staining with propidium
iodide (PI) and was analyzed by flow cytometry.
Detection of Autophagy With Green
Fluorescence Protein-Tagged MAP-LC3
Cultured cells were treated with DAC, SAHA, or both
agents combined for 3 days. On Day 3, the cells were
transfected with green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged
MAP-LC3 (GFP-LC3) plasmid. After 24 hours, the cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes and
mounted for confocal microscopy. GFP fluorescence was
observed under a confocal microscope, and autophagic
cells that demonstrated punctate GFP-LC3 staining were
counted.
Detection of Autophagy With Acridine
Orange Staining
Ovarian cancer cells were seeded and treated as described
above for the cell cycle assays. At the indicated times, the
cells were incubated with medium containing 0.5 lg/mL
acridine orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Ore) for
15 minutes in the dark, detached by trypsinization,
washed, and analyzed by fluorescence-activating cell
sorting analysis.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to
confirm morphologically the induction of autophagy by
examining alterations in the subcellular structures of Hey
cells in culture and in xenografts. Cells were cultured and
treated with DAC and/or SAHA for 5 days. Cultured cells
and tumor xenografts were fixed and prepared for TEM as
described previously.19 Representative areas were chosen
for ultrathin sectioning and viewed with a JEM 1010
transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan).

Small Interfering RNA Transfection
Hey cells were cultured and treated with DAC and/or
SAHA for 3 days. Transfection with control or ARHI
small interfering RNA (siRNA) was performed on Day 2
using the DharmaFECT-4 reagent (Dharmacon
Research, Lafayette, Colo). A mixture of siRNA (100 nM
final concentration) and transfection reagents was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes and then added
to the cells. After incubation for 48 hours, the cells were
harvested for confocal microscopy with GFP-LC3 or flow
cytometry with acridine orange staining.
Growth of Ovarian Cancer Xenografts in
Nude Mice
In vivo studies with Hey ovarian cancer xenografts were
carried out in 6-week-old female Balb-c nu/nu mice
according to protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Twenty mice were
divided into 4 treatment groups. Twelve additional mice
were divided into 4 groups for histologic studies on Day
22. All mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1  106
Hey cells in 200 lL RPMI-1640 media. Two days later,
the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1) vehicle
(control group), 2) DAC (0.8 mg/kg/3 times weekly), 3)
SAHA (12.5 mg/kg/5 times weekly), or 4) a combination
of DAC and SAHA at the same dose as the single-agent
treatments. Treatment was continued for 21 days. On
Day 22, tumors from 3 mice of each group were collected
and prepared for TEM. The remaining 5 mice from each
group were evaluated daily for morbidity and mortality.
Biostatistical Analysis
All experiments were repeated independently at least
twice. To assess in vitro growth inhibition and synergistic
inhibition, we used the SYNERGY22 program, which estimates dose-response curves for each agent, either alone or
combined, and quantifies drug interaction at different
inhibitory levels. One may conclude synergy when the
interaction index is <1 and its 95% confidence interval is
<1. The analysis is based on the median-effect principle
and the combination index method.23 Regression-based
analysis was used to test for associations between growth

inhibition and gene expression. For in vivo studies, the
statistical significance of differences in survival between
mice was analyzed using the log-rank test.24 We used the
Efron method25 to handle observations that had tied survival times. P values were obtained by 1-sided analysis,
and significance was assumed at P < .05.

RESULTS
DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors and HDAC
Inhibitors Decrease Growth of Ovarian
Cancer Cells
To identify optimal drugs, we compared the antiproliferative activity of 2 DNA methylation inhibitors (DAC and
AZA) and 2 HDAC inhibitors (SAHA and TSA) in 2
human ovarian cancer cell lines. Hey cells and SKOv3 cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of DAC
(0-100 lM), AZA (0-100 lM), SAHA (0-32 lM), or
TSA (0-2 lM). Growth was measured after 5 days of treatment. The viability of both Hey cells and SKOv3 cells was
reduced in a dose-dependent manner for all 4 agents
(Fig. 1). For cells that were treated with DAC, the reduction in viability at increasing doses could be fitted by
hyperbolic curves, which decreased to asymptotes at
approximately 30% for Hey cells and 60% for SKOv3
cells. In SKOv3 cells, there was no further increase in the
antiproliferative activity of DAC at concentrations >32
lM. However, treatment with AZA at doses >50 lM
killed all Hey cells and decreased SKOv3 cells at an asymptote of 15%. In contrast to the DNA methylation inhibitors, both HDAC inhibitors were very toxic to cells, and
all cells were killed at concentrations >8 lM and >0.72
lM for SAHA and TSA, respectively (Fig. 1). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and the IC75 for each agent,
individually and in combination, are presented in Table 1.
DAC and SAHA Exert Synergistic Inhibition
of Cell Growth
To explore the potential interaction between DNA
methylation inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors, we treated
Hey cells and SKOv3 cells with DAC or AZA in combination with SAHA or TSA. The concentrations for each
agent were determined based on the combination design
proposed by Chou,26 in which a mixture of 1 DNA

assays. The data plotted represent the optical density of SRB-stained cells that were treated with the different agents normalized

Treatment With DAC and SAHA Induces
Apoptosis
To examine whether the antiproliferative effect of DAC
and SAHA could be attributed to the induction of apoptosis, caspase 3/7 activities were analyzed in Hey and
SKOv3 cells that had been treated for 5 days with DAC
and/or SAHA at concentrations that resulted in 50% inhibition of cell growth. Treatment with DAC and SAHA
alone induced caspase activity in SKOv3 cells but not
in Hey cells, as illustrated in Figure 2. However, the combination of DAC and SAHA increased caspase activity
synergistically in both cell lines.

cycle analyses were performed on cells that were treated
for 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days. The percentages of cells in
G1, S, and G2/M phase are illustrated in Figure 3. When
used individually, treatment with SAHA had only a modest and inconsistent effect on the cell cycle over the course
of the experiment. DAC arrested a progressively greater
number of cells in G2/M over time with 16.1% of cells
arrested on Day 1, 28.7% arrested on Day 3, and 35.3%
arrested on Day 5 in Hey cells. DAC alone failed to affect
the fraction of SKOv3 cells in G2/M, but the combination of the 2 agents produced G2/M arrest in both cell
lines. In Hey cells, treatment with a combination of DAC
and SAHA increased the fraction of cells in G2/M progressively from 23.8% on Day 1 to 44.9% on Day 5. A
more modest effect was observed with SKOv3 cells on
Day 5, in which 20.4% of cells that were treated with the
combination were in G2/M compared with 14.1% for the
controls. Although both cell lines responded to the combination treatment by increasing the fraction of cells in
G2/M phase, the change in Hey cells was more evident.
The underlying mechanism that contributes to this
dichotomous effect is not clear. We also quantified the
sub-G0/G1 fraction as an additional assessment of apoptosis. Consistent with the caspase activity, DAC alone
produced a modest increase in the fraction of sub-G0/G1
cells, whereas SAHA had no effect. Combination treatment with DAC and SAHA resulted in a synergistic
increase in apoptotic cells (Fig. 2C,D).

DAC and SAHA Induce Autophagy in Hey
Ovarian Cancer Cells
DAC and SAHA inhibited the proliferation of both Hey
and SKOv3 cells by apoptosis and G2/M arrest. A third

methylation inhibitor and 1 HDAC inhibitor with the
diagonal constant ratio ([IC50 of DAC or AZA]:[IC50 of
SAHA or TSA]) was serially diluted before addition to the
cells. In every set of experiments, the combination of 1
DNA methylation inhibitor and 1 HDAC inhibitor
resulted in a significantly more pronounced cell kill compared with treatment using each single agent (Fig. 1,
Table 1). When results for each combination of inhibitors
were analyzed for additive, synergistic, or antagonistic
effects, the most prominent synergistic interaction was
observed between DAC and SAHA for both Hey and
SKOv3 cells. Other combinations resulted in primarily
additive toxicity. On the basis of these results, we chose
the combination of DAC and SAHA at their IC50 values
for all subsequent cell culture studies.

Figure 2. 5-Aza-20 -deoxycytidine (DAC) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) induce apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.
Ovarian cancer cells were treated with DAC and SAHA for 5 days at their respective 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) (see Table 1). Apoptosis in control and treated cells were determined by analysis of caspase 3/7 activities in (A) Hey cells or (B) SKOv3
cells or by flow cytometry in (C) Hey cells or (D) SKOv3 cells. RLU indicates relative light units.

possible mechanism that could contribute to their growth
inhibitory effects is autophagic cell death. To assess this
possibility, Hey and SKOv3 cells were transiently transfected with a GFP-LC3 plasmid, treated with DAC and
SAHA for 3 days, and then examined under a confocal
fluorescence microscope. Treatment of Hey cells with
DAC induced autophagy, as indicated by an increase in
GFP-LC3 puncta (Fig. 4A). Although SAHA alone did
not induce autophagy, it enhanced the ability of DAC to
induce autophagy. When the GFP-LC3 puncta were
counted in Hey cells, the number of puncta increased
from 60 puncta per 100 cells for the control cells to 150
puncta per 100 cells for the cells treated with combination
of DAC and SAHA. In contrast, autophagy was not
observed in SKOv3 cells after treatment with these agents.
To confirm that these agents induced autophagy, we
used acridine orange staining followed by flow cytometry.
Figure 4B indicates that DAC induced autophagy in Hey
cells with 36% acridine-positive cells on Day 3 and 35%

4430

acridine-positive cells on Day 5. Consistent with the
GFP-LC3–transfected cells, SAHA alone did not induce
autophagy, but the combination of SAHA and DAC
increased acridine-positive cells to 49% on Day 3 and to
51% on Day 5. No autophagy was observed for SKOv3
cells in any treatment group. Finally, we used TEM to
document autophagy in Hey cells that were treated for 5
days with diluent, DAC, SAHA, or both agents. Figure
4C indicates that treatment with DAC induced the formation of autophagosomes compared with the control
group. Whereas SAHA alone did not induce autophagy,
the addition of DAC þ SAHA further enhanced the number of autophagosomes.

that their expression can be increased by treatment with
demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors.16 In the current study, we evaluated whether the induction of ARHI
and PEG3 in ovarian cancer cells was correlated with the
inhibition of growth by DAC and SAHA. The expression
of ARHI and PEG3 in Hey and SKOv3 cells was quantified after treatment for 5 days with DAC, SAHA, or both
agents combined (Fig. 5). Cell growth was measured in
parallel cultures.
Treatment of Hey cells with DAC dramatically
induced ARHI and PEG3 expression and was associated
with a decrease in cell growth (Fig. 5A). Treatment with
SAHA alone had little effect on ARHI or PEG3 expression
but completely inhibited cell growth. The combination of
DAC and SAHA was more potent for inhibiting cell
growth and produced a dose-dependent increase in ARHI
and in PEG3 mRNA. These data indicate that levels of
ARHI and PEG3 are correlated inversely with growth
inhibition produced by a combination of DAC and SAHA.
For SKOv3 cells, DAC induced PEG3 and, to a
lesser extent, ARHI but had little effect on cancer cell
growth (Fig. 5B). Like what we observed in Hey cells,

Cancer

SAHA alone failed to induce ARHI or PEG3 expression
in SKOv3 cells but inhibited growth by >90%. A combination of DAC plus SAHA produced dose-dependent
induction of ARHI and PEG3 and >90% inhibition of
cancer cell growth.
A regression-based analysis was used test for an association between growth inhibition and gene expression.
We fit a regression model to the gene expression data,
adjusting for cell line, drug, and gene. Association was
determined by significance in the regression slope coefficients. Significance was assumed at P < .05. Growth inhibition of Hey cells was correlated with the induction of
ARHI after treatment with DAC (P ¼ .000004) or with a
combination of DAC and SAHA (P ¼ .00002). PEG3
levels appeared to vary inversely with growth inhibition
by DAC or a combination of DAC and SAHA, but a
slight depression in PEG3 levels at IC75 precluded a statistically significant correlation in each case. Growth inhibition by DAC or a combination of DAC and SAHA
in SKOv3 cells was correlated with ARHI (P ¼ .03 and
P ¼ .01, respectively) and with PEG3 levels (P ¼ .00009
and P ¼ 2.21E-13, respectively).

Significance was assumed at P < .05. Although SAHA
alone did not improve survival (P ¼ .135), treatment with
DAC alone (P ¼ .0169) or DAC combined with SAHA
(P ¼ .00184) for 3 weeks significantly increased survival.

were transfected with control small interfering RNA (siRNA)
(siControl) or with ARHI siRNA (siARHI) and then treated

with DAC and SAHA. Induction of autophagy was quantified by acridine orange staining and flow cytometry.
Knockdown of ARHI expression dramatically reduced
autophagy induced by DAC or DAC þ SAHA, as
indicated in Figure 6.
To examine whether growth inhibition produced by
DAC and SAHA also may depend, at least in part, on the
re-expression of ARHI and PEG3, Hey and SKOv3 cells
were transfected with control siRNA or with a mixture of
ARHI siRNA and PEG3 siRNA before they were treated
with a combination of DAC and SAHA. Changes in cell
proliferation were measured by SRB analysis. Our results
demonstrated that knockdown of ARHI and PEG3 had
no effect on DAC-induced or SAHA-induced growth inhibition (data not shown), suggesting that the observed
growth inhibition was mediated by other DAC-responsive
and SAHA-responsive genes.
DAC and SAHA Exhibit Additive Inhibition of
Ovarian Cancer Xenograft Growth
To further validate our in vitro studies, we used nude
mice with intraperitoneal human Hey ovarian cancer xenografts. Groups of mice were treated intraperitoneally
with 1 of the 4 treatments described above (see Materials
and Methods). The effect of treatment on survival was
evaluated, and the presence of autophagosomes was
examined by TEM. Figure 7A displays the Kaplan-Meier
survival curves for each of the 4 treatment groups. A test
of significance of each difference from the control was
provided by the log-rank test using the Efron method25
to resolve observations that had tied survival times.

Autophagy Is Observed in Ovarian Cancer
Xenografts After DAC and SAHA Treatment
To determine whether the action of DAC and SAHA in
vivo was associated with the induction of autophagy,
3 mice in each group were killed after 21 days of treatment, and their xenograft tumors were harvested for
TEM to examine for the presence of autophagosomes.
Although no or a few autophagosomes were detected in
the control and SAHA-treated groups, the number of
autophagosomes was significantly increased in the DACtreated groups, and the group that was treated with a combination of DAC and SAHA had the greatest number of
autophagosomes (Fig. 7B). Thus, the additive inhibition
of xenograft growth observed with DAC and SAHA may
be caused in part by the autophagic death of ovarian
cancer cells.
Treatment With DAC and SAHA Reactivates
the Expression of ARHI and PEG3 in Hey
Ovarian Cancer Xenografts
The combined treatment of DAC þ SAHA reactivated
both ARHI and PEG3 expression in cultured cells
(Fig. 5), as discussed above. To determine whether the
combined treatment also could reactivate the expression
of ARHI and PEG3 in xenografts, we quantified ARHI
and PEG3 transcripts in xenografts from mice that were
treated with DAC þ SAHA and compared the results
with those from control mice. Both ARHI and PEG3
transcripts were increased by approximately 1.5-fold in
xenografts from DAC þ SAHA-treated mice, as indicated
in Figure 8. The increase in ARHI expression was demonstrated further by increased immunohistochemical
staining with anti-ARHI antibody.

DISCUSSION
Our current study demonstrates that a combination of a
demethylating agent and a HDAC inhibitor can exert
synergistic inhibition of growth in ovarian cancer. This
principle may apply to a variety of cancers that arise from
different sites.27-30 Previous reports from the ovarian cancer literature have documented that demethylating
agents31 and histone deacetylating agents32,33 can inhibit
the growth of multiple cell lines and primary cultures
of ascites tumor cells,32 enhancing the activity of

enhanced the activity of cisplatin, which is associated
with the up-regulation of human mutL homolog 1

between DAC and belinostat in the absence of cisplatin.
In our study, maximally tolerated doses of DAC significantly inhibited Hey xenograft growth, and treatment
with DAC in combination with SAHA provided superadditive inhibition of xenograft growth that approached

statistical significance (P ¼ .068). Differences in outcome
between cell cultures and xenografts may relate to
pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic considerations,
particularly for SAHA. For patients with myelodysplastic
syndrome35,36 or chronic myelogenous leukemia,37 the
administration of low-dose DAC as an intravenous infusion has produced therapeutic responses. However, we
chose to use maximally tolerated doses of DAC because of
the route of administration (intraperitoneal vs intravenous) and because we wanted to maximize the inhibitory
effect of DAC and SAHA in the growth of Hey tumor
xenografts. The mice appeared to tolerate these doses and
regimens, because there were no early deaths or significant
weight losses with the combination treatment.
The growth inhibition produced in cell cultures and
xenografts with demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors may relate to the re-expression of growth-inhibitory
tumor suppressor genes. Although many genes may be
up-regulated or down-regulated when cells are treated
with demethylating agents alone38,39 or in combination
with HDAC inhibitors,40 a combination of the 2 agents

4436

can facilitate the re-expression of hypermethylated40 and/
or imprinted18 tumor suppressor genes, including ARHI
and PEG3. Treatment with DAC increased the expression
of ARHI and PEG3 in both cell lines. Although treatment
with SAHA alone had minimal effect on ARHI and
PEG3 expression, the combination of DAC and SAHA
had a greater effect on the induction of both ARHI and
PEG3. Growth inhibition produced by the combined
treatment correlated inversely with levels of ARHI and
PEG3.
The mechanisms by which DAC and SAHA inhibit
tumor growth are multiple and may vary between different ovarian cancers. Both ARHI and PEG3 can inhibit
clonogenic growth, and ARHI produces cell cycle arrest.16
In the current study, the combination of DAC and SAHA
produced apoptosis in both Hey and SKOv3 cell lines.
In previous reports, treatment with SAHA has produced
apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells,32,33 but, to our knowledge, the induction of autophagy has not been noted
previously. Treatment with DAC induced autophagy
in Hey ovarian cancer cells, and autophagy could be

enhanced by concomitant treatment with both DAC and
SAHA. Because it has been demonstrated that ARHI can
induce autophagy,19 increased levels of this gene may contribute to autophagic cell death. Knockdown of ARHI
reduced autophagy, consistent with the importance of
ARHI in regulating this function.
Taken together, our data suggest that a combination
of a demethylating agent and an HDAC inhibitor should
have greater impact on ovarian cancer than either treatment alone, and this finding deserves further evaluation in
the clinic. Re-expression of ARHI and PEG3 may provide
useful biomarkers for identifying biologically optimal
doses of the inhibitors.
