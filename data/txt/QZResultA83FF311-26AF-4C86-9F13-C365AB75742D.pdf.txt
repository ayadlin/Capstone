of choice. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens encompass single-agent and
combination therapy and sequential treatment. For this report, the author
reviewed the literature to determine which regimen, if any, was most beneficial.
The results indicated that studies have yielded a wide range of response rates,
but no single regimen has emerged as a clear leader. The literature is compounded further by lack of standardized criteria to determine pathologic complete response (which is predictive of survival benefits) and between-study
variation in the stringency by which this endpoint is defined. Given the lack of a
preferred treatment regimen in the neoadjuvant setting, identifying patients who
are likely to respond to specific agents could inform treatment decisions, improve
treatment outcomes, and aid in avoiding unnecessary exposure to potential toxicities. The development of novel agents for use alone or in combination with
existing agents may improve response rates further in the neoadjuvant setting,
especially because a significant proportion of breast tumors can be resistant to
many current antineoplastic agents. Particularly noteworthy are the epothilones
and their analogs because of their low susceptibility to common tumor-resistance
mechanisms. Initial data have indicated that ixabepilone, which is an epothilone
analog, has activity in the neoadjuvant setting, and predictive factors for response
have been identified. The future of neoadjuvant therapy lies in tailoring treatment to individual patients by identifying response predictors and developing
novel agents. This ultimately may lead to improved outcomes for women with
breast cancer. Cancer 2007;110:2394–407.  2007 American Cancer Society.

eoadjuvant chemotherapy is currently the standard of care for
the management of locally advanced, stage III invasive breast
cancer (BC) and for some stage IIA and IIB breast tumors. Ultimately,
the goal of therapy is to extend survival and improve quality of life.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plays an important role in achieving this
goal, although uncertainty remains about the impact timing of chemotherapy (neoadjuvant vs adjuvant) on survival outcome. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is included in treatment guidelines for patients
with locally advanced, invasive BC.1 However, a recent update of the
B-18 trial provided suggestive evidence that preoperative systemic
therapy may be superior to postoperative adjuvant therapy. (Norman

Preoperative Chemotherapy for Breast CA/Buzdar

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was sued first in
1973 in patients with inoperable, locally advanced
disease to afford tumor shrinkage and to render
these tumors treatable by radical mastectomy
or radiotherapy.2,3 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has
evolved since to use in operable breast tumors with
the objective of down staging the tumor so that
breast-conserving surgery (BCS) could become a
viable alternative to radical mastectomy.3 Several studies have attempted to assess whether, in the clinical
setting, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can impair metastatic growth and provide the survival benefits that
are concomitant with the eradication of metastases,
including metastases that are occult at the time of
surgery. Those studies included the use of a variety
of classes of chemotherapeutic agents as monotherapy, combination regimens, or sequential/alternating
therapies.
This article is a review of clinical experience with
the different neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens
that provides insight into treatment decisions and
highlights data from some of the newer classes of
agents in the neoadjuvant setting. Before reviewing
these studies, however, it is important to outline the
most meaningful markers of response, ie, those that
are most predictive of survival when using neoadjuvant therapy for the treatment of BC.

PATHOLOGIC COMPLETE RESPONSE—
A MEANINGFUL MARKER OF RESPONSE
IN NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY
A variety of endpoints can be used to measure outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for BC other
than directly measuring survival (both disease-free
survival [DFS] and overall survival [OS]), which, of
course, requires long-term follow-up. These include
overall response, clinical response (determined by
physical examination), radiologic response (determined by mammography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), pathologic response
(determined by histologic examination), and the rate
of BCS. The results from several clinical trials have
indicated that, of these outcome measures, pathologic complete response (pCR) is most predictive of
survival.4–8
Despite the proven predictive value of pCR in
this context, there is no consensus on the measurement of this important endpoint. Three of the most
commonly used criteria in the literature are those of
Sataloff et al.,7 Chevallier et al.,9 and Feldman et al.4
These 3 sets of criteria have some overlap (particularly Chevallier et al. and Feldman et al., because the
criteria described by Chevallier et al. are a modified

2395

version of those described by Feldman et al.) but, for
the most part, differ from each other (Table 1). Sataloff et al. provided specific criteria for both the primary tumor and the axillary lymph nodes. To add to
the complexity, the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
uses pCR criteria that are distinct from other pCR
methodologies; these criteria also are stringent and
are defined by no evidence of clinically invasive cancer in either the breast or the axilla.10,11
Differences in pCR evaluation criteria are compounded further by the different sites from which tissue can be sampled for pathologic evaluation and by
the various number of samples that may be collected
for evaluation. These discrepancies are highlighted in
the studies discussed here, in which an enormous
amount of variation was observed in the criteria
used for the measurement of pCR. Standardization of
pCR evaluation is needed before between-study comparisons of pCR rates can be possible.

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH NEOADJUVANT
CHEMOTHERAPY—COMPARING THE EVIDENCE
Although few would question the value of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the management of both operable and inoperable BC, currently, there is no
consensus about which chemotherapy regimen is the
best. To evaluate this further, a systematic review of
the literature was conducted using the Medline and
EMBASE databases. The search terms used were
‘‘neoadjuvant’’ or ‘‘preoperative,’’ and ‘‘breast cancer.’’ The search was open to all languages but was
restricted to clinical trials only and to dates between
1993 and September 2006. Abstract databases for
recent key congresses (American Society of Clinical
Oncology, 2002–2006; San Antonio Breast Cancer
Symposium, 2002–2005) also were searched. Because
between-study comparisons are limited by differences in study design, patient types, and criteria
used to measure response, only randomized clinical
trials were included in the literature analysis, thus
allowing direct comparison between chemotherapy
regimens within a robust study design.
Randomized clinical trial publications that were
identified from this search encompassed studies of
patients with inoperable and operable BC. To evaluate only the most clinically meaningful data, studies
with <30 patients were excluded from the analysis,
which left a total of 49 publications.

therapies or anthracycline monotherapy in terms of
clinical responses and, to a lesser extent, with pCR
(Table 2). It is important to note that studies may differ in terms of the criteria used to determine pCR;
thus, direct comparison of pCR rates across trials
should be made with caution. In an M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center study comparing paclitaxel monotherapy with combined fluorouracil (5-FU)/doxorubicin/
cyclophosphamide (FAC) before local therapy, the
clinical complete response (cCR) rates were 27% and
24%, respectively; however, the pCR rate (pCR criteria
from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) was lower
with paclitaxel than with FAC neoadjuvant therapy
(8% vs 17%; P value nonsignificant [NS]).12 Another
study compared neoadjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by adjuvant docetaxel with
neoadjuvant docetaxel followed by adjuvant AC.13
Although the overall response rate (ORR) was similar
between the 2 regimens, neoadjuvant docetaxel alone
afforded greater therapeutic benefit with respect to
pCR (pCR criteria not specified) and BCS rates, with
the largest between-treatment difference observed
with respect to the pCR rate (12.5% vs 4.8%; P 5 .2).

However, in a study comparing neoadjuvant docetaxel
with neoadjuvant AC, similar ORR rates (65% and
57%, respectively) and pCR rates (9.4% vs 7.7%; pCR
criteria not specified) were observed in the docetaxel
and AC groups (no P values were provided).14
Increased responses to single-agent neoadjuvant
chemotherapy have been demonstrated after the
addition of radiation treatment. For example, the
addition of radiation to paclitaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy slightly improved the ORR (68% vs 86%; P
value NS) and, it is worth noting, substantially
increased the pCR rate (defined as clearance of invasive cancer in the breast and axilla) from 5% to 16%
(no P value was provided). However, limited data
support the concomitant use of irradiation and taxanes, and further safety evaluations will be necessary
before such treatments become part of regular clinical practice15,16 (Table 212–18).

Comparison of combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy
The 23 publications that described clinical studies
comparing combination chemotherapy (summarized
in Table 3) fell broadly into 2 groups: those that

compared regimens with 2 agents and those that
compared regimens with 3 agents.

Two-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens
Ten randomized studies of 2-agent neoadjuvant clinical trials were identified (Table 3), and 4 of those studies compared different 2-agent regimens,19–22 5
which compared differing numbers of cycles of the
same regimen23–27 and 1 of which compared the
same regimen presurgery and postsurgery.8 The latter
study was one of the first studies to directly compare
neoadjuvant AC and adjuvant AC.8 At 9-years of follow-up, the DFS and OS rates were similar in both
groups.
Combination therapy of doxorubicin with either
paclitaxel (AP) or cyclophosphamide (AC) also has
been assessed.20 ORR and cCR rates were higher with
the AP regimen than with the AC regimen (ORR, 89%
vs 70%; cCR, 15% vs 7%; no P values were provided)
(Table 3). The pCR rate (Chevallier et al. criteria; the
Sataloff et al. criteria also were used to grade pathologic response by an independent pathologist) also
was higher with the AP regimen (no P values were
provided), with a range similar to that reported in
the single-agent studies (8–16% for the AP arm and
6–10% for the AC arm as assessed by investigators
and independent review). DFS rates were high in
both treatment arms (70% at 31-month follow-up).
In addition, BCS was more frequent in the AP arm
(58%) compared with the AC arm (45%; no P value
was provided). In an Anglo-Celtic Cooperative Oncology Group study comparing doxorubicin in combination with either docetaxel or cyclophosphamide, a

similar pattern was observed with respect to ORR
and cCR rates (both of which were slightly higher in
the taxane-containing arm; P value NS), but the pCR
rate (with pCR defined as the absence of invasive
cancer in the breast) was slightly, but not significantly, lower in the taxane-containing arm.21 The
rates of BCS in both arms were identical (20%), and
the OS and DFS rates were slightly higher (P value
NS) with the taxane-containing regimen.
The efficacy of vinorelbine/epirubicin (VE) as
neoadjuvant therapy in early BC was compared with
that of the standard neoadjuvant AC (the Trial of Preoperative Infusional Chemotherapy [TOPIC] 2 trial).
ORR and cCR rates were similar, and pCR rates were
identical (pCR criteria not specified) for the 2 arms.19
Therefore, VE was as effective as AC as neoadjuvant
treatment; it is noteworthy, however, that the toxicity
profile of VE generally was better than that of AC.
In studies that compared the same 2-agent
neoadjuvant therapy regimen with differing numbers
of treatment cycles, increasing the number of cycles
of chemotherapy generally increased the cCR and pCR
rates.23–27 In 3 instances, the difference in pCR rates
was statistically significant (P 5 .045,23 P 5 .0045,25
and P 5 .04).27

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens with ‡3 agents
Fourteen randomized studies provided head-to-head
comparisons of combination neoadjuvant regimens
that involved 3 agents (Table 3). Two of those studies compared the effect of a regimen as neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy.28,29 The studies
generally supported the use of neoadjuvant therapy

in the management of BC but did not provide insight
into the optimal combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic agents.
Among the studies that compared multiple-drug
combinations, the TOPIC trial compared the efficacy of
continuous infusional 5-FU (5-FU)-based chemotherapy (plus epirubicin and cisplatin) with conventional
bolus AC chemotherapy. 5-FU–based chemotherapy
was no more active than the conventional treatment,
and no trend was observed toward a significant effect
on survival. The pCR rate (pCR criteria not specified) in
both arms was 16%.30
Several studies have investigated the value of
anthracyclines in combination chemotherapy regimens. Some improvement in ORR with the inclusion
of doxorubicin was observed in women who were
randomized to receive either 4 cycles of neoadjuvant
AC plus 5-FU or 4 cycles of the alkylating agent thiotepa plus cyclophosphamide and 5-FU (ORR, 75% vs
59%, respectively; P 5 .01).31 The 5-year OS and DFS
rates, however, were slightly higher in the thiotepa
arm (P value NS), and rates of BCS were similar
between the 2 cohorts (Table 3). Combinations of
another anthracycline (epirubicin) with a taxane
(paclitaxel) or with cyclophosphamide and 5-FU as
neoadjuvant therapy both were effective regimens.32
ORRs were higher in the double-agent arm (79.2%)
compared with the triple-agent arm (50%; no P value
was provided), although cCR rates were low in both
groups (4%), and no patients achieved a pCR (pCR
criteria not specified).
Direct comparison of anthracycline-containing
FAC with the combined cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU (CMF) regimen was made in
patients with locally advanced BC.33 ORRs were identical (67%) in both groups.
Dose intensification has been used as an
approach to increasing the efficacy of anthracyclinebased neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 3 studies, all of
which reported no benefit with this approach. In a
European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer-National Cancer Institute of Canada-Swiss
Study Group for Clinical Cancer Research study,
patients with locally advanced BC were randomized
to receive either a standard (cyclophosphamide
75 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2, and 5-FU 500 mg/m2
for 6 cycles every 28 days) or a dose-intensified (cyclophosphamide 830 mg/m2 and epirubicin 120 mg/m2
for 6 cycles every 14 days) anthracycline-based regimen.34 No measurable therapeutic benefit for dose
intensification was observed. Similar results were
observed in a study of anthracycline dose intensification in patients with operable BC that compared
4 cycles of high-dose neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide/

2399

epirubicin (100 mg/m2)/5-FU with standard-dose
cyclophosphamide/epirubicin (60 mg/m2)/5-FU.35 An
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center study investigated doseintensified FAC administered at doses of 1200 mg/m2,
60 mg/m2, 1000 mg/m2 and compared with standard
FAC (1000 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2, and 500 mg/m2).
Although the ORR was significantly higher on the doseintensified arm (76% vs 90%; P 5 .01), neither the pCR
and BCS rates nor the 5-year DFS and OS rates differed
significantly between the 2 treatment arms. Moreover,
there was substantially greater toxicity on the doseintensified standard regimen, precluding further development of this schedule36 (Table 38,19–41).

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens with sequential
or alternating regimens
Since the first suggestion that sequential chemotherapy potentially was superior,42 many studies have
investigated this approach. Sequential chemotherapy
can mean either the administration of multiple drugs
in a preplanned sequence with no breaks or the
administration of each new drug after disease progression on the prior drug. Either way, its use often
results in survival rates comparable to those achieved
with combination regimens and allows each drug to
be administered to its maximum tolerated dose while
minimizing cross-toxicity risk.43 It is noteworthy that
several trials have demonstrated that sequential
chemotherapy is an effective means of increasing the
pCR rate.
The National and Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project (NSABP)-27 trial evaluated the use of
1) sequential docetaxel after neoadjuvant AC, 2)
neoadjuvant AC alone, and 3) neoadjuvant AC followed by adjuvant docetaxel44 (Table 4). Preoperative
response results for Groups 1 and 3 (neoadjuvant AC
alone) were pooled and compared with those for
Group 1 (neoadjuvant AC 1 docetaxel). The addition
of docetaxel to the neoadjuvant AC regimen resulted
in significantly increased pCR rates (with pCR
defined as the absence of invasive cancer in the
breast), from 12.9% to 26.1% (P < .001), and cCR
rates increased from 40.1% to 63.6% (P < .001). There
was no significant difference in the rate of BCS
between patients who received neoadjuvant docetaxel compared with those who did not, which the
authors noted was not surprising, because the
addition of docetaxel resulted only in a 6% increase
in the number of patients who had an objective clinical response (Table 4). Full results of this study indicated that neoadjuvant docetaxel, but not adjuvant
docetaxel, significantly improved DFS in patients
who achieved a pCR after AC and that pCR was a

significant predictor of OS regardless of treatment
(P < .0001).6
The German Preoperation Adriamycin Docetaxel
Trial (Gepar-DUO) study from the German Breast
Group45 compared responses between 4 cycles of
doxorubicin and docetaxel (ADOC) with 4 cycles of
AC followed sequentially by 4 cycles of docetaxel
(AC-DOC). Like in the NSABP-27 trial, sequential use
of docetaxel resulted in a higher pCR rate (14.3%;
pCR defined as the absence of invasive cancer in the
breast and axilla) compared with combination use
(7%; P < .001). Moreover, the increased rate of BCS
with AC-DOC was of borderline significance (ACDOC, 63.4%; ADOC, 58.1%; P 5 .05).
Another clinical benefit of adding sequential
docetaxel, this time after combined cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CVAP)
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, was demonstrated in the
Aberdeen trial.46,47 Responders to 4 cycles of CVAP
were randomized to receive either 4 additional cycles
of CVAP or 4 cycles of docetaxel. Responses were higher
in the docetaxel group, with a cCR rate of 56% versus
33% in the CVAP-only group (no P value was provided).
Moreover, the pCR rate in the docetaxel group (30.8%)
was higher than in the CVAP-only group (15.4%;
P 5 .04). OS and DFS rates also were increased in the
docetaxel group along with the rate of BCS (data not
supplied). The authors noted that, in 2002, the pCR rate
(pCR defined as absence of invasive cancer in the
breast) of 19% among all patients (both initially responsive and nonresponsive to CVAP) who were treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel was one of the highest
reported among such patients.
An advantage of adding sequential docetaxel also
was observed in a study of patients who were randomized to receive 5-FU, doxorubicin or epirubicin,
and cyclophosphamide (FAC and FEC, respectively),
or FEC followed by docetaxel.48 ORRs with docetaxel
were 70% versus 41.4% (no P value was provided) in
the FAC/FEC only group. In contrast, however, pCR
rates (based on Japanese Breast Cancer Society criteria) with sequential docetaxel were approximately
half those reported in the FAC/FEC group (no P
value was provided) (Table 4). In a separate study, no
increases in ORR or cCR were observed on treatment
with docetaxel before doxorubicin and AC versus AC
alone; pCR rates (pCR criteria not specified) also
were comparable between the 2 treatment arms.49
Similar results were reported in a Hoosier Oncology
Group trial that involved patients with newly diagnosed stage II or noninflammatory stage II BC.50 The
clinical response rates were similar in both treatment
arms (sequential doxorubicin 3 3 followed by docetaxel 3 3 or both drugs in combination 3 4) (Table

2401

4); however, pCR rates (pCR defined as the absence
of invasive cancer in the breast and axilla) were
slightly higher among patients in the sequential
group, who also had fewer positive lymph nodes
than patients in the combination group (mean, 2.17
vs 4.81 positive lymph nodes; P 5 .037) and were
more likely to undergo BCS (37% vs 19%, respectively; no P value was provided). It is noteworthy that
there was an unexpected incidence of grade 3 of 4
hand-foot syndrome in the sequential group, suggesting that sequential chemotherapy does not
improve toxicity in all instances.
A German Gynecologic Oncology Breast Cancer
Study Group trial compared 2 epirubicin- and paclitaxel-containing regimens given either as dose-dense
sequential chemotherapy or in a standard dose as
neoadjuvant therapy for primary BC.51 Both the pCR
rate (defined as the absence of invasive tumor in the
breast) and the BCS rate were significantly higher in
patients who received the sequential regimens
(P 5 .030 and P 5 .016, respectively), although the
finding that dosing levels and frequencies varied
between the 2 treatment arms makes a direct
between-treatment comparison difficult. An increased
rate of BCS also was reported after the large European
Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer trial, in
which women were to either 1) undergo surgery followed by 4 cycles each of doxorubicin then CMF; or 2)
undergo surgery followed by 4 cycles each of doxorubicin-paclitaxel (AT) then CMF; or 3) receive 4 cycles
each of AT then CMF followed by surgery.52 The rate of
BCS in the adjuvant groups (Groups 1 and 2) was significantly lower at 34% than in the neoadjuvant group
(Group 3; 65%; P < .001).
A different study, Gepar-TRIO, failed to demonstrate a difference in response in patients who had
not responded to treatment with docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and subsequently were treated with either further TAC or
sequential vinorelbine and capecitabine.53 The cCR
rates in the 2 arms were 22.5% and 21.9%, respectively, whereas the pCR rates were 7.3% and 3.1%,
respectively (no P values were provided). Further
accrual into the Phase III study should allow a more
thorough analysis. Patients with an early response to
TAC 3 2 were randomized to receive either 4 or 6
additional cycles of TAC. The overall pCR was 17%,
and there was a moderate increase in toxicity in the
patients who received 8 cycles.54
The potential benefits of noncross-resistance in
sequential doxorubicin-based chemotherapy were
suggested in an M. D. Anderson Cancer Center study.
Patients were treated with 3 cycles of neoadjuvant
vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and

2402

CANCER

prednisone (VACP) followed by surgery.55 The ORR
was 83.4% and the pCR rate was 12.2%; both types of
responses were predictive of improved survival. Poor
responders to this neoadjuvant regimen were randomized after surgery to receive either 5 more cycles of
VACP or 5 cycles of noncross-resistant treatment:
vinblastine, methotrexate with calcium leukovorin
rescue and 5-FU (VbMF). Recurrence-free survival
and OS were higher in patients who received VbMF
compared with patients who received further VACP,
although the difference did not reach statistical significance. It is possible that alternative postsurgery
regimens, based on this principle of noncross-resistance, may prove more successful.
Another study from the M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center and the Brown University Oncology Group
has demonstrated that increasing the dosing frequency of a single component of a sequential chemotherapy regimen can afford multiple efficacy
benefits. Patients were randomized to receive weekly
paclitaxel (at a dose dependent on lymph node status) followed with FAC versus paclitaxel given every
3 weeks followed by the same FAC regimen.56
Although the weekly and every-3-week schedules
resulted in similar rates of cCR (34% vs 24%, respectively; P value NS) and pCR (defined as the absence
of invasive tumor in the breast; 30.5% vs 21.3%,
respectively; P 5 .2), the schedule that contained
weekly paclitaxel resulted in significantly higher pCR
(defined as absence of invasive tumor in the breast
and axilla; 28.2% vs 15.7%; P 5 .02) and BCS (47% vs
38%; P 5 .05) (Table 4).6,44–62

THE FUTURE OF NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN
BREAST CANCER
The results from the literature review described in
this report illustrate 2 key points. First, no clear
patterns emerged that may identify the optimal
neoadjuvant treatment regimen for all patients.
Anthracycline-based regimens are used frequently
because they have demonstrated activity as adjuvant
therapy. When taxanes are used, it appears that
paclitaxel is administered weekly more often and, if
it is included in a sequence, as the first agent in the
series. Docetaxel, in contrast, has been administered
more frequently every 3 weeks and after other chemotherapy when it is used sequentially. Second, in
those studies in which pCR rates were reported,
there was enormous variation in the criteria used for
the measurement of pCR. This highlights the need
for standardization of pCR evaluation, which would
facilitate simpler between-study comparisons. It is
noteworthy that a new continuous measure of patho-

logic response, residual cancer burden (RCB), has
been proposed.63 This is calculated as an index combining pathologic measurements of primary tumor
(size and cellularity) and lymph node metastases
(number and size). It has been demonstrated that
RCB is predictive of distant recurrence-free survival,
and RCB identified a larger group of high-risk
patients compared with post-treatment revised
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging. Such a
measure may prove to be more predictive of survival
and better able to define chemotherapy resistance in
future trials than current pCR assessments.
The apparent lack of a trend toward a particular
regimen as the optimal neoadjuvant treatment in
this literature summary underscores the finding that
it is highly unlikely that a single neoadjuvant regimen will become the ‘‘magic bullet’’ in all types of
patients. Therefore, identifying which patients are
most likely to respond to a specific regimen could
significantly improve neoadjuvant treatment outcomes. The use of individualized neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens opens the door to potential
improvements in prognosis without increasing the
potential for unwanted side effects that are experienced needlessly by patients who are resistant to
specific types of chemotherapy.

Identifying new agents for neoadjuvant therapy in
breast cancer
The use of novel agents, either alone or in combination with existing agents, potentially could improve
response rates to neoadjuvant regimens in patients
with both operable and inoperable BC. New agents
currently are under evaluation in this setting in both
Europe and the United States, because information on efficacy and safety can be obtained easily
with neoadjuvant treatment. The combination of a
chemotherapeutic agent with nonchemotherapeutic
agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, is clearly an
avenue for further studies. One study has compared
neoadjuvant docetaxel monotherapy with docetaxel
plus the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. Although
data were presented for the 2 groups combined with
no between-treatment comparisons, clinical response
was favorable, with an ORR of 79.6% and a cCR rate
of 14.3%.17,18 The addition of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab to paclitaxel was assessed by comparing 2 different 2-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy
regimens: paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with
HER2-negative BC compared with paclitaxel/trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive BC. The latter
regimen was associated with a pCR rate (pCR criteria
not specified) almost 3 times as high as that in the
HER2-negative patients (78% vs 29%; Table 3).22 It

Preoperative Chemotherapy for Breast CA/Buzdar

also has been demonstrated that the addition of trastuzumab to docetaxel and carboplatin generates a
much higher pCR rate than the chemotherapeutic
agents alone (36.4% vs 9%), reaffirming the benefit of
trastuzumab as an addition to combination chemotherapy.41
The therapeutic benefit of adding trastuzumab
to sequential chemotherapy (4 cycles of paclitaxel
followed by 4 cycles of 5-FU, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) in HER2-positive patients also has
been demonstrated.57 The addition of trastuzumab
improved cCR rates from 47.4% to 86.9% and
improved pCR rates (defined as the absence of invasive cancer in the breast and axilla) from 26.3% to
65.2% (P 5 .016). The original protocol was modified
to include 22 additional patients in the trastuzumab
arm.58 In these additional patients, the pCR rate was
54.5%, and the pCR rate among all patients on
chemotherapy plus trastuzumab was 60%. It is worth
noting that a follow-up analysis has indicated no
recurrences in patients who were randomized to
receive chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, and the
estimated DFS at both 1 years and 3 years was 100%.
Despite the push to identify new agents, neoadjuvant trials that currently are recruiting (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov) mainly involve familiar classes
of agent, including various combinations of chemotherapy agents (eg, taxanes and anthracyclines),
hormone therapies (eg, letrozole, triptorelin, and exemestane), or kinase inhibitors (eg, lapatinib, gefitinib,
and AZD2171). One novel agent, the mammalian target
of rapamycin inhibitor and immunosuppressant everolimus, is being studied in combination with letrozole in
women with newly diagnosed estrogen-receptor (ER)positive BC.
Of the novel chemotherapeutic agents, the
epothilone analog class may be of particular interest.
Epothilones and their analogs are a novel class of antineoplastic agents that promote tumor cell death by
stabilizing microtubules and inducing apoptosis.64,65
Derived from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, epothilones and their analogs are 16-membered
macrolides with unique antibiotic and antifungal
properties.66,67 Natural epothilones A and B are of
greatest interest from a therapeutic perspective,
because they inhibit the growth of human cancer
cells in vitro at nanomolar or even subnanomolar
concentrations. Since 1996, several synthetic and
semisynthetic analogs have been synthesized from
epothilone B (EPO-906, patupilone).68 Of these, ixabepilone (BMS247550) is the furthest along in terms
of clinical development and has shown promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile in a range of
tumor types, including multiresistant BC.69–75 EPO-

2403

906 also has shown promising activity in a Phase II
trial of gastric cancer,76 and patients currently are
being recruited for a Phase III trial in ovarian cancer
(see www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00262990). In addition, epothilone D (KOS-862) is undergoing Phase II
clinical evaluation in BC and lung cancer.77,78
The development of this novel class of antineoplastic agents is particularly relevant given the high
rate of resistance developed by breast tumors to
many current antineoplastic agents, including the
anthracyclines and taxanes. A major cause of both
intrinsic and acquired tumor resistance is overexpression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and multidrug-resistance–associated protein (MRP) genes,
resulting in the removal of drugs from tumor cells by
the protein efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and
MRP. Ixabepilone does not induce tumor cells to
overexpress MDR1 or MRP, and it has low susceptibility to the encoded efflux pumps.79 Similarly, it has
been demonstrated that EPO-906 possesses anticancer activity in in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies,
including paclitaxel-resistant models in which cancer
cells overexpress P-gp.80 Additional mechanisms
through which tumor cells derive resistance to antimicrotubule agents, such as paclitaxel, is through
point mutations in b-tubulin or preferential overexpression of the bIII-tubulin isotype, which is not targeted by paclitaxel. Because the tubulin-binding
mode of ixabepilone affects the microtubule dynamics
of multiple b-tubulin isoforms, including bIII-tubulin,
the drug still was active in a paclitaxel-resistant tumor
cell model in which bIII-tubulin was overexpressed.81
Currently, these preclinical observations are translating
into clinical effects: Adjuvant ixabepilone has demonstrated antitumor activity in taxane-refractory patients
in Phase I and II studies.69,82 Tumor response to EPO906 also has been demonstrated in Phase I trials in
patients with several cancers, including BC, and Phase
II studies are in progress.
The full results are eagerly awaited from a clinical trial evaluating ixabepilone in the neoadjuvant
setting, specifically in treatment-naive patients with
locally advanced BC (stage IIA-IIIB). Early analyses
(to date, presented only in abstract form) are promising, with an acceptable safety profile and pCR rate in
the breast of 18%.83,84 To put this into context,
recently published studies of single-agent taxane
neoadjuvant therapy with docetaxel achieved a pCR
rate in the range from 9% to 12.5% (Table 2).13,14
Moreover, ixabepilone maintained activity in ERnegative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and
HER2-negative (triple-negative) patients, with a pCR
in breast of 26% and a pCR in breast and lymph
nodes of 19%.85 It is worth noting that the pCR rate

2404

CANCER

was evaluated in the ixabepilone study using the criteria of Sataloff et al.,7 which, as highlighted above in
this review, are stringent pCR criteria.

Identifying pharmacogenomic predictors of response to
neoadjuvant therapy
Clinical trials of neoadjuvant therapy provide an
ideal scenario for determining prognostic and predictive factors of response to specific regimens, because
biopsies can be taken before chemotherapy and
compared with tumors after surgical removal. HER2
status, ER/PR status, and p53 and Ki67 levels are just
some of the pharmacogenomic markers that already
have been correlated with response to chemotherapy
using this approach.84,86–88
With respect to the epothilone analogs, the trial
mentioned above in which ixabepilone is being evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting is assessing gene
expression for the prediction of pCR to ixabepilone
as the primary endpoint. The ER and several genes
that are part of the ER pathway appear to be predictive of response to ixabepilone.84 Such a predictive
model could be used in future trials with the objective of selecting those patients who are likely to benefit from ixabepilone.

CONCLUSIONS
For years, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been the
cornerstone of BC treatment in both inoperable and
operable tumors. To date, research has provided
many answers with regard to neoadjuvant therapy
for BC but also has raised numerous questions. The
answers include patient selection (patients with stage
IIA, IIB, and III disease are considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including patients with operable
disease and those with inoperable disease) and the
use of pCR as a reasonable surrogate endpoint for
survival. The unanswered questions include the following: What should be the standardized method for
determining pCR (primary tumor or primary tumor
and lymph node assessment)? Which drug or drug
combinations are preferred based on efficacy and
toxicity? And which regimens (drugs, dosing, intervals, sequencing, and number of cycles) are recommended? Currently, there is no ‘‘gold standard’’
neoadjuvant regimen, and no single regimen has
emerged to date as a clear leader in terms of treatment outcomes. What is clear, however, is that pCR
is highly predictive of survival benefits and that
standardization of this measure is needed.
The future of neoadjuvant chemotherapy lies in
the ability to predict response to specific chemother-

apeutic agents, including newer agents in development, such as the epothilone analogs. By combining
these avenues of research, treatment could be tailored to be of greatest benefit to the individual
patient and ultimately should improve outcomes for
women with BC in the long term.
