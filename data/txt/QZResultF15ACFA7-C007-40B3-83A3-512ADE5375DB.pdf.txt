BACKGROUND: B-cell lymphoma, Unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, for convenience referred to here as unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma, is a category in
the 2008 World Health Organization system used for a group of histologically aggressive neoplasms that are difficult
to classify definitively. Currently, there is no established standard therapy for these neoplasms. METHODS: The
authors assessed MYC status and correlated it with treatment response and outcome in a group of 52 patients with
unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma treated with either a standard DLBCL regimen (R-CHOP [rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone-related therapy]) or more intensive regimens, such as R-hyperCVAD (rituximab plus hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating
with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine). The regimens were selected by the treating clinicians based on the
overall clinical and pathological findings. RESULTS: Thirty (58%) unclassifiable B-cell lymphomas had MYC abnormalities (MYCþ) including 27 with rearrangement, 2 with amplification, and 1 with both. The MYCþ and MYC groups were
similar in their age distribution and International Prognostic Index scores. Progression-free survival of patients with
MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma treated initially with R-CHOP was significantly worse than patients treated with
R-hyper-CVAD (P ¼ .0358). In contrast, for the MYC unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma group, some patients responded
to R-CHOP, and others were refractory to R-hyper-CVAD. CONCLUSIONS: MYC aberrations are common in unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma. The presence of MYC aberrations identifies a patient subset that requires more aggressive
therapy than R-CHOP. In contrast, MYC unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma patients responded variably to either RC 2011 American
CHOP or aggressive therapy, and the latter showed no survival advantage. Cancer 2012;118:1566-73. V

INTRODUCTION
Although criteria for classifying a high-grade B-cell lymphoma as either diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or
Burkitt lymphoma (BL) are established, a subset of neoplasms exhibit morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap and
therefore are difficult to classify. These neoplasms have been referred to in the literature as gray zone or borderline highgrade B-cell lymphomas.1 Gene expression profiling studies have shown that the gene signature of these neoplasms is part
of a spectrum between DLBCL and BL.2,3 Formally recognizing these gray zone or borderline neoplasms, the 2008 World
Health Organization (WHO) classification proposed a new category designated as ‘‘B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with
features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma.’’4 The category, which for

convenience we will refer to as unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma, is stated to be ‘‘a heterogeneous category that is
not considered a distinct disease entity, but is useful in
allowing the classification of cases not meeting criteria for
classical Burkitt lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.’’4 MYC gene rearrangement, which is characteristic of BL and occurs in 5% to 10% of cases of
conventional DLBCL, is detectable in a substantial number of unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma cases.5
Although the unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma category captures the histological and immunophenotypic
spectrum of disease and is convenient for classifying an
individual neoplasm, this category does not address the
issue of therapy. Patients with BL are usually treated with
highly aggressive chemotherapy regimens, such as rituximab with R-hyper-CVAD (rituximab plus hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and
dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate
and cytarabine) at our institution.6 By contrast, patients
with DLBCL are usually treated with R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
and prednisolone-related therapy). The optimal therapy
for patients with neoplasms categorized as unclassifiable
B-cell lymphoma is currently unknown.
To address this issue, we retrospectively analyzed 52
patients who had lymphomas that met the criteria for
unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma and assessed the importance of MYC status for predicting therapeutic response.
Our results suggest that MYC assessment has prognostic
importance in patients with unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma, as those with a MYCþ neoplasm had a better progression-free survival when treated with aggressive
chemotherapy regimens. Our results further suggest that
patients with MYC unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma represent a heterogeneous group, as some patients respond to
R-CHOP, and others are refractory to either R-CHOP or
more aggressive chemotherapy regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was undertaken after the approval of the institutional review board (IRB) and was conducted in accordance with the regulations of health information
protection policies. Clinical information was obtained
from the corresponding medical records.
Case Selection
As the category of B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with
features intermediate between DLBCL and BL was only

Cancer

March 15, 2012

introduced in the 2008 WHO classification, we could not
search for cases labeled as such. Instead, we searched for
cases accessioned between 2001 and 2007 that had diagnoses thought likely to include at least a subset of cases
that would meet the 2008 WHO criteria for unclassifiable
B-cell lymphoma. Cases with the diagnosis of typical BL
and DLBCL were not included in this search, as neither
group is included in the unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma
category of the WHO classification. The diagnostic terms
that were searched included high-grade B-cell lymphoma,
not otherwise specified (NOS); diffuse aggressive B-cell
lymphoma, NOS; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with
high-grade (or aggressive) features; high-grade B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like; and Burkitt-like lymphoma. Patients
with a history of low-grade lymphoma (such as follicular
lymphoma), human immune deficiency virus-related
high-grade B-cell lymphoma, or primary central nervous
system lymphoma were excluded. The search was not
extended past 2007 to allow for adequate clinical followup. Cases without clinical follow-up were excluded. After
retrospective review, a subset of 52 cases fit within the category of unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma.
All lymphomas included in the study group had 2 or
more of the following features: starry-sky pattern, high
mitotic rate, abundant apoptosis, or a high proliferation
rate as assessed by Ki-67 immunohistochemical analysis.
Until publication of the 2008 WHO classification,
the approach in our department for cases of high-grade Bcell lymphoma in which the differential diagnoses of
DLBCL and BL were not clear was to issue a provisional diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and then perform
additional immunohistochemical studies (if needed) as well
as cytogenetic analysis. For the latter, fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) for MYC rearrangements was performed, usually on fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections,
but in some cases results of conventional cytogenetic analysis were available on fresh tissue of the diagnostic biopsy
specimen or a concurrent positive bone marrow aspiration
and biopsy specimen. Once the results of additional studies
including MYC/8q24 rearrangement status became available, an attempt was made to establish a more definitive diagnosis. Individual pathologists weighed the morphologic,
immunophenotypic, and MYC/8q24 evidence somewhat
differently, but in most cases the pathologist attempted to
further classify the neoplasm as closer to DLBCL or BL,
although some neoplasms could not be further classified.
This information was added as an addendum to the pathology report. The addendum to the report typically took 1 to
2 weeks to be issued. For many patients telephone

1567

Original Article

conversations between the pathologist and oncologist also
occurred, usually within 2 to 3 days of biopsy.
Patients were subsequently treated by several oncologists at our institution, on an individual basis and not as
a part of a specific protocol, either with R-CHOP or more
intensive chemotherapy regimens. This decision was
based on the judgment of the oncologist, informed by
clinical and laboratory findings. Although in retrospect all
cases were unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma, at the time of
diagnosis, the pathologist’s opinion as to whether the lymphoma was closer to BL or DLBCL, albeit with atypical
features, also may have played a role in the selection of a
treatment regimen.
Clinical Findings
The treatment regimens used for this study cohort were divided into 2 categories: patients treated initially with RCHOP versus patients treated with more intensive
regimens, including R-hyper-CVAD or CODOX (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, leucovorin, methotrexate, and vincristine). Patient age, Ann Arbor clinical
stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, number of extranodal sites, and performance status obtained from the medical record were used to calculate the International
Prognostic Index (IPI).7 Overall survival (OS), progressionfree survival (PFS), and response to therapy were evaluated.
Immunophenotype
Immunohistochemical studies were performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of biopsy
specimens according to standard procedures described
previously.8 The monoclonal antibodies used were specific for CD10 (1:70), BCL2 (1:200), BCL6 (1:40), and
Ki-67 (MIB-1, 1:100) (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif). Flow
cytometric immunophenotypic analysis was performed
on a subset of cases using a panel of antibodies including
CD5, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD38, kappa, and lambda
as described previously.9
Conventional Cytogenetics and FISH
Conventional analysis (G-band karyotype) was performed
in a subset of cases using standard procedures as previously described.10
FISH analysis was performed using fixed, paraffinembedded tissue sections or metaphase slides if available.
Hybridization signals were analyzed using a fluorescent
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with appropriate
filters. MYC was assessed using an LSI MYC dual-color
breakapart rearrangement probe (Vysis, Downers Grove,

IL). The results were considered positive for MYC rearrangement if there were 3 signals in a nucleus, 1 orange, 1
green, and 1 yellow. FISH analysis for BCL2 rearrangement
was performed in a subset of cases using an LSI BCL2 dualcolor breakapart probe or a LSI IGH/BCL2 dual color, dual
fusion translocation probe (Vysis). Cases were positive for
t(14;18)(q32;q21) if the signals were 1 orange, 1 green, and
2 yellow (fusion)(IGH/BCL2 translocation probe), or positive for BCL2 rearrangement if the signals were 1 orange, 1

were captured using the Cyto Vision imaging system
(Applied Imaging, Santa Clara, CA).
Statistics
Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the probability of OS and PFS, and log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests
were performed to compare subgroups of patients. Fisher
exact test was used to compare clinical, immunohistochemical, and pathologic data. For the purpose of statistical analysis, cases that were considered closer to DLBCL
were designated as having large-cell morphology.

different in their clinical and laboratory features or their
IPI scores.

between the cells of DLBCL and BL, had variable numbers of large cells (large-cell morphology), or had an
immunophenotype (BCL2þ, CD10, or Ki67 < 95%)
inconsistent with BL. The MYCþ group included 3 neoplasms with atypical morphologic features that had an
immunophenotypic profile (BCL2, CD10þ, Ki67 >
95%) typical of BL, and 4 neoplasms that morphologically closely resembled BL with Ki-67 > 95%, but had
bright BCL2 expression inconsistent with BL. In the
MYC unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma group, the neoplasms showed a similar spectrum of morphologic and
immunophenotypic features. As MYC rearrangement was
absent, the diagnosis of BL was not considered.
The MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma group
was more often CD10þ than the MYC unclassifiable Bcell lymphoma group (P ¼ .0078). There was no significant difference between the MYCþand MYC groups in
the frequency of large-cell morphology, or BCL2 or
BCL6 expression. The proliferation (Ki67) rate was similar in the MYCþ and MYC groups. The MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma group more often had tumors that
were BCL2þ, CD10þ, and Ki67 > 95% (P ¼ .033).
The MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma group
included 27 cases with rearrangement, 2 cases with
amplification, and 1 case with both rearrangement and
amplification. The proportion of cells that carried abnormal MYC signals ranged from 30% to 90%, with a median
of 70%. In 4 of 6 cases analyzed by conventional cytogenetics, 8q24/MYC rearrangement was identified as part of
a complex karyotype.
Thirty-six cases were evaluated for BCL2 gene rearrangement. Sixteen (46%) unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma
cases had BCL2 rearrangement in addition to MYC
abnormalities, including 13 with concurrent MYC rearrangement, 2 with MYC amplification, and 1 with both
MYC amplification and rearrangement. Eight MYCþ
cases were negative for BCL2 rearrangement. BCL2 analysis failed in 1 MYCþ case. Of the 12 MYC cases analyzed, 3 were positive for BCL2 rearrangement, 1 had
BCL2 amplification, 7 were negative, and 1 failed. BCL2
gene rearrangement was more common in MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma tumors, but this achieved only
marginal significance (67% vs 27%; P ¼ .06).

Treatment and Outcome
Nineteen patients with MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma were treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens: 18 with R-hyper-CVAD and 1 with CODOX. The

1570

remaining 11 patients were treated with R-CHOP. Thirteen patients with MYC unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma
were treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens: 11
with R-hyper-CVAD, 2 with CODOX (Magrath) regimen, which consisted of cyclophosphamide, cytarabine,
doxorubicin, leucovorin, methotrexate, prednisone, and
vincristine. The remaining 9 patients were treated with RCHOP.
Seventeen patients with unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma developed relapsed disease, including 11 in the
MYCþ group and 6 in the MYC group. In the MYCþ
group, 8 patients were initially treated with R-CHOP and
3 with an intensive regimen. In the MYC group, 4
patients were initially treated with an intensive regimen
and 2 with R-CHOP. For salvage therapy, these patients
were treated with R-ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, cisplatin), RICE (rituximab, ifosfamide,
carboplatin, etoposide), BEAM-R (carmustine, etoposide,
cytarabine, melphalan and rituximab), or R-hyperCVAD with or without stem cell transplantation.
The OS and PFS of patients in the study group are
shown in Figure 2. The median follow-up period was 995
days. The OS of patients treated with R-CHOP versus
more intensive therapy was not significantly different
(Fig. 2A), but there was a trend for MYCþ patients to
have a shorter OS (Fig. 2B). Further analysis showed that
MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma patients treated
with R-CHOP had marginally poorer OS than MYC
unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma patients (P ¼ .0854) (Fig.
2C). In contrast, the PFS of MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell
lymphoma patients treated with R-CHOP was significantly shorter than that of MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell
lymphoma patients treated more intensively (P ¼ .0358)
(Fig. 2D). The OS and PFS of patients with MYC
unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma were not significantly different for the 2 treatment groups (P ¼ .4084 and P ¼
.5803, respectively). A subset of MYC unclassifiable Bcell lymphoma patients, however, was refractory to intensive therapy, with a short OS.
The OS and PFS of 14 patients who had unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma associated with MYC and BCL2
rearrangements, also known as double hit or MYC/BCL2
lymphoma (Fig. 2E, F), was also assessed. The OS of these
14 patients was not significantly different from that of 10
patients with unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma associated
with only MYC rearrangement (P ¼ .2681), although
there was a trend for a shorter PFS for patients with MYC/
BCL2 lymphoma (P ¼ .0968). Patients with MYC/BCL2
lymphoma treated with R-hyper-CVAD did not appear

We also assessed the prognostic impact of BCL2

and PFS than patients with unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma without BCL2 expression (P ¼ .011 and P ¼

Analysis of the patients with MYCþ unclassifiable Bcell lymphoma found no significant differences between
the R-CHOP–treated group versus the intensively treated
group with regard to age, stage of disease (P ¼ .44), number of extranodal sites involved (P ¼ .71), IPI score (P ¼
.69), and frequency of BCL2 expression (P ¼ .71). However, more patients with a better performance status (0-1)
were in the intensively treated group than in the RCHOP–treated group (P ¼ .03).

DISCUSSION
In the 2008 WHO classification, a new category of lymphoma was introduced, designated as ‘‘B-cell lymphoma,
unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma.’’4 This
new category, which is recognized to be heterogeneous
and not a single biologic entity, encompasses aggressive Bcell lymphomas that show morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap with both DLBCL and BL, but do not fit
into either category. Gene expression profiling of these
neoplasms has shown a profile intermediate between
DLBCL and BL.2,3 A subset of these neoplasms is known
to carry MYC rearrangement (MYCþ). Unclassifiable Bcell lymphoma poses a therapeutic challenge, as traditional treatment protocols have been designed for either
DLBCL or BL. Patients with DLBCL are generally
treated with R-CHOP, whereas patients with BL are
treated with more intensive regimens, such as R-hyperCVAD.
In this study, we retrospectively collected cases that
met the current WHO classification criteria for unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma to assess their response to chemotherapy and evaluate the prognostic impact of MYC.
Patients with MYCþ unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma had
an overall poorer outcome when treated with R-CHOP
compared with more intensive regimens such as R-hyperCVAD, which yielded improved OS and PFS. The inferior OS of patients treated with R-CHOP was statistically
significant during the early course of the disease and
became less evident later. We believe that this is most
likely explained by patients receiving more intensive treatment, such as RICE and stem cell transplantation, once
their disease relapsed, thereby ameliorating to some extent
the suboptimal effects of R-CHOP therapy. We also
believe that the significantly lower rate of relapse and
improved PFS in the more intensively treated group suggest that more intensive therapy is indicated and that R-

1572

CHOP is insufficient therapy for patients with MYCþ
unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma.
MYC is a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family transcription factor that regulates approximately 15%
of all cellular genes and is involved in cell cycle control,
apoptosis, metabolism, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis.11
MYC aberrations are likely to confer a powerful growth
advantage for lymphoma cells. Recently, Savage and colleagues reported a series of DLBCL patients treated with
R-CHOP. They found that MYCþ patients had a worse
survival and higher rate of central nervous system relapse
than MYC patients.12 Other studies of patients treated
with CHOP have shown that patients with DLBCL
associated with MYC aberrations have a poorer
prognosis.13-16
A significant subset of unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma cases associated with MYC gene rearrangements
also carried BCL2 gene rearrangement. These neoplasms
are also known as double hit or MYC/BCL2 lymphomas.
Affected patients have been shown to have an aggressive
clinical course and likely constitute a distinct biological
group.17-23 Two patients with unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma associated with MYCþ and BCL2 translocations
treated with R-hyper-CVAD in this study remained in
complete remission at 21 and 27 months. The OS of 14
patients who had double hit or MYC/BCL2 lymphoma
was not significantly different from that of patients with
unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma who carried only MYC
rearrangements in this study group. Furthermore, patients
with MYC/BCL2 lymphoma treated with R-hyperCVAD did not appear to sustain longer survival than
those treated with R-CHOP. There are at least 2 possible
explanations for these results. One is that several previous
studies have included patients who had a history of follicular lymphoma. We excluded such patients in this study.
The other possibility is that the poor outcome of patients
with these aggressive tumors can, to some degree, be ameliorated by early recognition and more intensive therapy.
Three cases in this series had extra MYC signals consistent with amplification. Interestingly, all of these neoplasms also had BCL2 rearrangement, and 2 of 3 patients
died during the follow-up period. The behavior of unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma with MYC amplification is not
well documented in the literature. Our experience suggests that these tumors are generally aggressive and have
an association with BCL2 rearrangement. Therefore,
MYC amplification appears to be associated with a poor
prognosis similar to MYC translocation in the unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma patient group.

The therapeutic responses of patients with unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma that lacked a MYC abnormality
were heterogeneous and can be subdivided into 2 subsets.
One patient group was refractory to therapy, including intensive chemotherapy, and had very poor survival. The
second group responded to treatment (either R-CHOP or
R-hyper-CVAD) and had a low recurrence rate during the
follow-up period. The less favorable outcome observed in
some patients with MYC unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma
was somewhat unexpected, especially in cases that displayed a germinal center immunophenotype. Two MYC
unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma patients who both died
within 1 year because of refractory disease had aberrant
BCL2 findings; 1 with BCL2 rearrangement and the other
with extra BCL2 signals shown by FISH, raising the possibility that BCL2 aberrations may be involved in refractoriness to therapy. We also showed that expression of BCL2
protein was associated with both shorter OS and shorter
PFS in this cohort. These results suggest that additional
studies and novel therapeutic approaches are needed for
these patients, rather than simply intensifying therapy.
In summary, this study shows that knowledge of
MYC status is useful in predicting response to chemotherapy in patients with B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with
features intermediate between DLBCL and BL, as
recently defined in the 2008 WHO classification. MYC
aberrations in unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma identify a
group of patients who had a poor response to R-CHOP,
but seemed to benefit from more aggressive therapeutic
regimens. We suggest that assessment of the MYC gene be
included in the workup of all histologically aggressive Bcell lymphomas that may fit within the category of unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma.
