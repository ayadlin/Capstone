Cyclin D Interacting Protein Inactivation by Ras Associated
with Diabetes in Cancer Cells under Doxorubicin Treatment

Abstract
Ras associated with diabetes (Rad) is a Ras-related GTPase that promotes cell growth by accelerating cell
cycle transitions. Rad knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and premature senescence without additional cellular stress in multiple cancer cell lines, indicating that Rad expression might be critical for the cell cycle in
these cells. To investigate the precise function of Rad in this process, we used human Rad as bait in a yeast
two-hybrid screening system and sought Rad-interacting proteins. We identified the Grap2 and cyclin D interacting protein (GCIP)/DIP1/CCNDBP1/HHM, a cell cycle–inhibitory molecule, as a binding partner of Rad.
Further analyses revealed that Rad binds directly to GCIP in vitro and coimmunoprecipitates with GCIP from
cell lysates. Rad translocates GCIP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the tumor suppressor
activity of GCIP, which occurs in the nucleus. Furthermore, in the presence of Rad, GCIP loses its ability to
reduce retinoblastoma phosphorylation and inhibit cyclin D1 activity. The function of Rad in transformation is
also evidenced by increased telomerase activity and colony formation according to Rad expression level.
In vivo tumorigenesis analyses revealed that tumors derived from Rad knockdown cells were significantly
smaller than those from control cells (P = 0.0131) and the preestablished tumors are reduced in size after
the injection of siRad (P = 0.0064). Therefore, we propose for the first time that Rad may promote carcinogenesis at least in part by inhibiting GCIP-mediated tumor suppression. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4357–65. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Subtractive hybridization initially identified the gene encoding Ras associated with diabetes (Rad) as being overexpressed in type II diabetic muscle (1, 2). Rad is a 35-kDa
Ras-related GTPase encoded by a gene located at human
chromosome 16q22 (1). Rad differs from the other Rasrelated GTPases in several properties, including its lack of
several characteristic domains including prenylation motifs,
a GTP-binding domain, and NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions (3). Rad is a nonlipid-dependent cytosolic protein (3)
that is overexpressed in tumor tissue, interacts with nm23,
and is associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients (4). Rad participates in Ca2+-triggered signaling events,
such as the CaMKII serine/threonine kinase cascade, in
which it interacts with calmodulin (5), calmodulin-dependent

protein kinase II (5), and tropomyosin (6). Previously, Tseng
and colleagues reported that Rad promotes cell growth by
accelerating cell cycle transitions (4). However, the exact
function of Rad in the cell cycle is not yet known.
Senescence, which is defined as an irreversible cell cycle
arrest, is an inherent tumor suppression mechanism (7, 8).
In the process of identifying senescence-associated genes,
we found that Rad was significantly suppressed in cancer
cells that had undergone doxorubicin-induced cell cycle arrest. Notably, knockdown of Rad resulted in cell cycle arrest
and premature senescence without additional cellular
stress in multiple cancer cells. To investigate the connection between Rad knockdown and cell cycle arrest, we
screened for intracellular molecules capable of interacting
with Rad.
This study presents results showing a novel physical interaction between Rad and the Grap2 and cyclin D interacting
protein (GCIP; ref. 9). GCIP is a human homologue of the
MAID protein and the D-type cyclin–interacting protein 1.
GCIP is a 40-kDa helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein (10,
11) that is expressed mainly in terminally differentiated tissues (10), with lower expression levels observed in human
breast, prostate, and colon tumor tissues (12). The gene encoding GCIP is located on chromosome 15q15, which is frequently deleted in tumor tissues, including those of the colon,
breast, lung, and bladder (13). GCIP is known to interact with
Grap2 (9), cyclin D1 (9), and SirT6 (12), and has been shown
to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter,

decrease the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at Ser780, slow cell cycle progression, and decrease susceptibility to carcinogenesis (10, 11, 14, 15).
In the present study, we explored the role of Rad in regulating cellular senescence and sought to identify some of the
involved mechanisms. Specifically, we investigated the effects
of Rad expression on the cellular response to DNA-damaging
agents. Our results revealed that Rad expression led to decreased senescence and increased doxorubicin resistance.
Furthermore, Rad expression downregulated multiple genes
involved in growth arrest or senescence, and decreased the
protein levels of p27 in doxorubicin-treated cells. Telomerase
activity and colony formation were increased by Rad expression and in vivo tumorigenesis in athymic nude mice was
found to differ based on the Rad expression level of the tumorigenic cells. Finally, we showed for the first time that Rad
interacts with GCIP, and inhibits GCIP-mediated decreases
in cyclin D activity and Rb phosphorylation, which are critical for both the cell cycle and senescence (16). Based on
these novel findings, we propose that this function of Rad
may significantly contribute to tumor progression through
the inhibition of senescence.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, and plasmids
293T cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies Life
Science). Human prostate (PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP), stomach (SNU638, MKN74, and SNU668), and breast (MDA-MB468)
cancer cells were grown in RPMI (Life Technologies Life Science).
Normal human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), purchased
from Lonza, were grown in PeEBM (Lonza). Immortalized
(RWPE-1) and transformed (RWPE-2) prostate epithelial cells
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were
grown in K-SFM (Life Technologies). All constructs were
generated by PCR using primers designed from the coding
regions of the relevant human cDNAs. The full-length Rad
open reading frame was cloned from HeLa mRNA for Flagtagged cloning into pCMVTaq2B (Clonetech). HA-taggedGCIP constructs were ligated into pCMVTaq4C (Clonetech).
Stable cell lines overexpressing Rad were selected with
changes of fresh medium containing G418 (600 μg/mL). Radtargeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) and control siRNA
were obtained from Dharmacon. Cells were transfected with
siRNA or plasmids using Effectine (Qiagen) or the Amaxa
electroporation system (Amaxa), according to the supplier's
protocol. Antibodies against Rb, p21, p27, E2F-1, cyclin A,
cdc2, cyclin D1, Flag, and β-actin were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against pRbS780 and Rad were
purchased from Cell Signaling and Abnova, respectively.
Yeast two-hybrid analysis
Yeast two-hybrid screening with human Rad was performed with the activation domain (AD)-tagged HeLa cDNA
library. Yeast strain PBN204 (Panbionet) was cotransformed
with two hybrid plasmids, a bait plasmid pBCT-Rad that
encodes a GAL4 DNA BD-fused Rad cDNA, and a pACT2

4358

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

plasmid that encodes the human HeLa cell cDNA fused
to GAL4 AD. Three different reporter genes, URA3, ADE2,
and lacZ, each of which was under the control of different
GAL4-binding sites, were used to minimize false positives.
The transformants were spread on selective media lacking
leucine, tryptophan, and uracil and containing 2% glucose
(SD-LWU), in which the transformants can grow when
BD-Rad interacts with AD-prey proteins. One hundred
thirty-five independent colonies grew on selective media
SD-LWU. Colonies grew on selective media lacking leucine,
tryptophan, and adenine, and containing 2% glucose (SDLWA). Colonies showed a blue color in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, which was confirmed by filter
assay to allow for the detection of β-galactosidase expression.
pBCT-polypyrimidine tract binding protein and pACT2polypyrimidine tract binding protein served as the positive control for the protein-protein interaction (17). pBCT (Panbionet)
and pACT2 (Clontech) were used as the negative control.
In vitro transcription, translation, and glutathione
S-transferase pull-down assay
The Rad cDNA was in-frame cloned into pGEX4T-1
(Amersham) to produce the glutathione S-transferase (GST)
fusion proteins for GST-pull-down assay. GST, GST-Rad fusion
proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads
(Amersham) and incubated with normalized 10 μL of GCIP
labeled with [35S]methionine in a buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.6), 50 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% NP40, and
10% glycerol]. The beads were then washed and the bound
proteins were eluted with the SDS-loading buffer containing
5% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed
by autoradiography. GCIP labeled with [35S]methionine was
prepared by subcloning cDNA into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen)
and in vitro translation using the TNT quick-coupled rabbit
reticulocyte system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation, 293T cells were transfected
with pFlag-Rad or pHA-GCIP, washed with cold PBS, and
lysed in a buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L β-glycerophosphate, 1%
Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail]. The cell lysates
underwent centrifugation at 14,000 g at 4°C for 15 minutes.
Anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling) was incubated with protein G-agarose overnight in PBS at 4°C. The immunecomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting.
Immunofluorescence
Cells (293T) were transfected with plasmids using Effectine. After 24 hours, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS buffer, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100,
and blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin.
Fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibodies
overnight, washed with PBS, and incubated with the secondary antibodies conjugated to either Alexa 488 or

of a cyclin D1– and a phosphorylated Rb–responsive element, were used. For Rb phosphorylation reporter assays,
cells were transfected with either empty vector pHA-GCIP,
pFlag-Rad, or a combination of plasmids together with luciferase vector. After 48 hours, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined according to the supplier's
protocol (Promega). Luciferase activity is given as mean

In vivo tumorigenesis
To examine the effect of Rad expression in tumor formation,
1.5 × 106 PC-3 cells were implanted s.c. into 4-week-old female
BALB/c nude mice and the tumor growth was monitored using
calipers every 3 to 4 days. For a treatment model, exponentially
growing PC-3 cells (1.5 × 106/injection) were implanted s.c. into
the nude mice for tumor formation. When tumors reached an
average size of 40 to 50 mm3 (∼4 wk), mice were divided into
two groups: siControl (siC) and siRad. The mice received two
(day 1 and day 7) intratumoral injections of siRNA as a mixture
of siRNA (50 nmol/L) in 100 μL of Effectene per injection. Tumor
volume was calculated using the formula (a × b2) × 0.5, in which a is
a long axis and b is a short axis in millimeters. All mice were
obtained from the Charles River Laboratory, maintained and
sacrificed according to institutional guidelines, and the procedures
were approved by the Institutional Committee on the Use and Care
of Animals and Recombinant DNA research.

Results
Identification of Rad as a cell cycle–associated molecule
Doxorubicin is an anticancer agent frequently used to treat
a variety of solid tumors and triggers DNA damage–induced
premature senescence (8, 18, 19). Low-dose doxorubicin reduced
Rad expression (Fig. 1A, top) and induced a senescence-like
growth arrest 5 days after the treatment in PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells (Fig. 1A, bottom), as evidenced by flat,
enlarged, SA-β-Gal–positive cells (Fig. 1B, left). However, overexpression of Rad prevented the doxorubicin-induced growth
arrest (Supplementary Fig. S1A; Fig. 1B, left) and improved cell
growth compared with doxorubicin-treated control cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). These results indicate that Rad suppresses DNA damage–induced cell cycle arrest and induction

of premature senescence in PC-3 cells. Importantly, a clonogenic survival assay revealed a shift in the doxorubicin dose
response among Rad-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B, right), indicating that Rad expression increased doxorubicin resistance.
We next examined whether the decrease of Rad might be related to this drug-induced cell growth inhibition. An assay of
cell viability using trypan blue staining revealed that siRad specifically inhibited cell growth, whereas the control siRNA did
not (Fig. 1C). Notably, the cell growth inhibition was siRad dose
dependent. As shown in Fig. 1D, Rad overexpression effectively
rescued cells from siRad-induced premature senescence, indicating that these biological changes were Rad mediated.
Rad knockdown induces cell cycle arrest and senescence
We next examined the effect of siRad on the cell cycle
progression of PC-3 cells. Knockdown of Rad significantly
arrested cell growth inducing premature senescence, compared
with siC-treated cells, and the percentage of SA-β-Gal–
positive cells increased gradually until the 5th day after
siRad transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). As

shown in Supplementary S2A and Fig. 2A, siRad-transfected
cells were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Propidium iodide/Annexin staining (Supplementary Fig. S3A)
and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling assays (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C)
confirmed that siRad-transfected cells failed to undergo
cell death by either apoptosis or necrosis.
Senescence is defined as irreversible growth arrest,
which is associated with cell cycle inhibitors (20, 21).
Rad knockdown increased the level of p27 and decreased
Rb phosphorylation; these effects were accompanied by a
decrease in the S-phase proteins cdc2, cyclinA, and E2F1
(Fig. 2B).
To test whether Rad knockdown–induced senescence is a
general phenomenon in cancer cells derived from different
tissues, several cell lines were evaluated for Rad expression
and siRad-induced senescence. The tested cancer cells from
different tumor tissues displayed senescence after transfection with siRad (Fig. 2C). Previously, we reported that doxorubicin induced senescence in PC-3 and LNCaP cells but not
in DU145 cells (22, 23). However, DU145 cells, which contain
mutated forms of p53, pRb, and p16, developed senescence in
response to Rad knockdown, which is consistent with previous studies (8, 24) showing premature senescence in

breast tumor cells and colon cancer cells that lack functional p16. The previously reported senescence marker proteins PAI-1 (25), osteonectin (26), and transglutaminase
(27) were increased in some cell lines after Rad knockdown in the tested diverse cancer cell lines (Fig. 2D), providing further confirmation of senescence induction by Rad
knockdown.
Rad interacts with GCIP and induces its translocation
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
To define the precise mechanism of Rad-mediated cell
cycle control, we used the full-length Rad cDNA as bait in
a yeast two-hybrid system, screened a HeLa cDNA library,
and identified several clones that seemed to specifically
interact with Rad. DNA sequencing and basic alignment
searches of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database allowed us to identify one of the positive
clones as corresponding to GCIP (Fig. 3A), which was previously reported as a cell cycle inhibitory molecule (13, 14).
To examine whether GCIP is able to interact with Rad in
mammalian cells, we transfected GCIP-HA or Rad-encoding
expression vectors into human 293T cells and performed
immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, Rad was detected
by Western blot analysis after coimmunoprecipitation with an

strain PBN204 was cotransformed with the GAL4-BD fusion plasmid pBCT or pBCT-Rad, and GAL4-AD fusion plasmid pACT2 or pACT2-GCIP.
Transformants were streaked on selective media SD-LWU, SD-LWA, and a SD medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside.

SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Coomassie-stained GST fusion proteins from the same gel are aligned to show protein levels. D, cytoplasmic

anti-HA antibody. The results revealed that Rad specifically
interacted with GCIP. Coimmunoprecipitation assays with
in vitro translated GCIP and recombinant GST-Rad revealed
that the GCIP protein directly interacted with GST-Rad but
not with GST alone (Fig. 3C). To examine where the GCIPRad binding may occur in cells, we fractionated cell lysates
from 293T cells transfected with Rad and/or GCIP, and subjected cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions to immunoblot analysis. The results indicated that Rad was present mainly in the
cytoplasm, whereas GCIP was translocated from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm in the presence of Rad (Fig. 3D, left). To further investigate whether GCIP associates with Rad in vivo, we
transfected 293T cells with GCIP alone, or Rad and GCIP, and
subjected the cells to immunofluorescent staining. Consistent
with a previous report (28), GCIP transfectants showed
fluorescence almost exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 3D,
right). Notably, however, cotransfection of Rad with GCIP
resulted in the translocation of GCIP from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). Rad-induced GCIP translocation
was also observed in PC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
GCIP-mediated inhibition of Rb phosphorylation and
cyclin D1 is repressed by Rad
To determine whether the interaction between GCIP and
Rad has any effect on GCIP-modulated Rb phosphorylation
and cyclin D1 activation, we cotransfected 293T cells with

Rad- or GCIP-expressing plasmids plus ppRb-TA-Luc or
pGL3-cyclin D1-Luc. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, the activities
of both reporters were decreased in cells transfected with the
plasmid encoding GCIP (lane 1 versus 2; ppRb-TA-Luc,
P = 0.001; pGL3-cyclin D1-Luc, P = 0.0008) but not with that
encoding Rad (lane 1 versus 3, P > 0.05). Cotransfection of
vectors encoding both Rad and GCIP relieved the downregulation of the reporter activities seen in GCIP-expressing cells
(lane 2 versus 4, P < 0.0001). To further confirm the inactivation of GCIP by Rad in carcinoma cells, we performed the
same experiment using PC-3 cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, expression of recombinant GCIP downregulated
Rb phosphorylation and cyclin D1 activity in PC-3 cells expressing GCIP alone (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively),
but not in PC-3 cells coexpressing Rad (lane 3 versus 4,
P > 0.05).
Rad overexpression increases cyclin D1 expression and
Rb phosphorylation
Because GCIP has been reported to inhibit the expression
of cyclin D1 (13), we examined whether Rad overexpression
might enhance cyclin D1 levels. Western blot analysis
showed that cyclin D1 expression was increased in Radoverexpressing 293T cells (Fig. 4C, top). In addition, phosphorylation of Rb at Ser780, a site exclusively phosphorylated
by cyclin D1-Cdk4 (29), was also enhanced in Rad-expressing

cells exhibit increased cyclin D1 and pRbS780. Cell lysates from 293T-derivative transfectants were separated from SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblotting (top). Bottom, expression of Rad enhances 293T cell proliferation. Stable 293T cell clones (1 × 102) were seeded in six-well culture plates.
At the indicated times, cells in triplicate wells were analyzed using trypan blue staining. D, a model based on our studies illustrates that Rad inhibits
GCIP by cytoplasmic sequestration, thereby increasing the levels of cyclin D1 expression and Rb phosphorylation.

clones (C2 and C20) compared with the empty vector control (V) cells. In contrast, the protein levels of pRb appeared
unchanged across all tested cells. These results suggest that
Rad may increase carcinogenesis by inhibiting the GCIPmediated downregulation of cyclin D1. Rad-overexpressing
cells showed a significant increase in the cell proliferation
compared with its empty vector–transfected cells (Fig. 4C,
bottom). A model based on our studies is presented in
Fig. 4D.
Rad modulates long-term colony formation and
telomerase activity
When we determined the levels/localization of Rad and
GCIP in normal, immortalized, and transformed human prostate cell lines, including prostate cancer–derived cell lines, we
observed that the cellular Rad levels increased with malignant
progression (Fig. 5A, top). Furthermore, Rad expression
caused the majority of the expressed GCIP to shift from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A, bottom). To examine
whether ectopic expression of Rad affects long-term colony
formation and telomerase activity, we established PC-3 clones
stably overexpressing Rad and a negative control stably containing the empty vector. Interestingly, our results revealed
that colony formation and telomerase activity was significantly and dose-dependently higher in Rad-overexpressing cells

relative to controls (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B; Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, overexpression of GCIP abrogated Rad-induced
colony formation, cyclin D1 expression, and Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 5C).
Rad knockdown decreases in vivo tumorigenesis
Then we compared the tumor formation of stable Radtransfectant PC-3 and the control cells after s.c. implantation of cells into athymic nude mice. Rad-expressing
cells formed tumor in 12 of 15 mice, whereas control
cells formed none of five mice during 6 weeks after the
transplantation (P = 0.0036; Supplementary Table S1). Our
results also revealed that tumorigenesis was significantly
and dose-dependently higher in Rad-overexpressing cells
than in controls (P = 0.0104, t test comparing vector to
Rad-10; Fig. 6A). Lastly, we investigated whether Rad knockdown could suppress tumor formation in vivo. When PC-3
cells transfected with siRad or siC were transplanted s.c. into athymic nude mice, the control cells formed tumors with
an average size of 424 ± 68 mm3 over 6 weeks. In contrast,
siRad-transfected cells developed tumors that averaged
93 ± 28 mm3 in size during the same period (P = 0.0131;
Fig. 6B). More interestingly, in a tumor treatment model,
the preestablished tumors progressed much more slowly
after injecting siRad twice, which has been introduced

directly into the tumors (P = 0.0064; Fig. 6C), which strongly
suggested that Rad could be an effective molecular target
for cancer therapy.

Discussion
Senescence, which is defined as an irreversible growth arrest,
is an important response by solid tumors following conventional
chemotherapy or γ-irradiation. Conversely, escape from therapyinduced cellular senescence may form the basis of cancer
recurrence or progression (17, 30, 31). To improve our understanding of how malignant cells escape senescence, we sought
to define some of the genes that control cell cycle arrest. In a
cDNA microarray hybridization analysis, we found that DNA
damage–induced cell cycle arrest selectively inhibited a set of
genes that included Rad. We subsequently found that Rad
knockdown alone could induce cell growth arrest, which seemed
to occur through senescence-like cell cycle arrest, but not cell
death, in multiple cancer cells. Intriguingly, Rb, p53, and p16
were not required for siRad-induced cell cycle arrest. Indeed,
among the tested cell lines, DU145 cells (which are resistant to
doxorubicin treatment and contain mutations in p53, pRb, and
p16) and PC-3 cells (which do not have functional p53 or p16)
both entered growth arrest following Rad knockdown.
To understand how Rad regulates the cell cycle, we
searched for Rad-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid
system and HeLa cDNA library. Although Rad was previously reported to interact with nm23 (4), calmodulin (5),
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (5), and tropomyosin (6), this is the first study to show that Rad is capable of modulating the cell cycle through an interaction
with GCIP. Several previous studies have suggested that
GCIP may function as a potential tumor suppressor in

4364

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

human cancers. For example, GCIP was shown to interact
with cyclin D1 and inhibit its transcriptional activity (9),
and also decrease Rb phosphorylation, thereby downregulating cell cycle progression (10, 12). Lack of GCIP promotes the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma,
suggesting that the absence of GCIP can contribute to
a higher tumor incidence (13, 14, 32), and overexpression
of GCIP in cancer cells has been associated with marked
inhibition of cell growth (11, 12). GCIP associates with
nuclear protein p29 and appears to execute its tumor
suppressive functions in the nucleus (33). Therefore, it
is perhaps unsurprising that the cytoplasmic sequestration
of GCIP by Rad is associated with decreases in the inhibition of the GCIP-mediated cyclin D1 activity and increased cell cycle progression.
Although amplification of the gene encoding cyclin D1 is frequently observed in human cancers (34), cyclin D1 protein
overexpression is more common than its gene amplification
(35), suggesting that additional mechanisms may exist to cause
the overexpression of cyclin D1 in human cancers. Increased
Rad expression has been observed in human cancers and
has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer (4).
Here, we show that Rad can enhance cyclin D1 protein
expression by inhibiting the GCIP-mediated downregulation
of Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). In view of the fact that
GCIP is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, the
increased expression of Rad may be an important factor
contributing to the cyclin D1 overexpression frequently seen
in cancer tissues. Furthermore, our findings indicate that
Rad-overexpressing cells are resistant to growth arrest and
can proliferate in the presence of DNA damage–inducing
agent that would normally induce senescence. Finally, this
work provides in vivo evidence of differential tumorigenesis
according to Rad knockdown.

Rad Inhibits GCIP

In sum, we herein show for the first time that Rad interacts with GCIP and inhibits GCIP-mediated reductions of Rb
phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis.
