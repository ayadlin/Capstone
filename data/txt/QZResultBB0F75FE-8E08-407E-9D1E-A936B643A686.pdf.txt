Breast Cancer Subtype-SpeciÔ¨Åc Interactions with the
Microenvironment Dictate Mechanisms of Invasion
Tuyen T. Dang, Amanda M. Prechtl, and Gray W. Pearson

Abstract
Most ductal breast carcinoma cells are weakly invasive in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that components of their
microenvironment may facilitate a transition from in situ to invasive stages during progression. Here, we report
that coculture of mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts speciÔ¨Åcally triggers invasive behavior in basal-type breast cancer cells
through a ligand independent mechanism. When cultured alone in organotypic culture, both basal- and luminaltype breast cancer cells formed noninvasive spheroids with characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In
contrast, when cocultured with mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts, basal-type spheroids exhibited invasive character whereas
the luminal-type spheroids retained a benign and noninvasive duct-like architecture. Real-time imaging and
functional studies revealed that the speciÔ¨Åcity of invasion was linked to a unique capacity of basal-type breast
cancer cells to move within spheroids. Mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts induced invasion by triggering basal-type breast
cancer cells to convert from a noninvasive program of mammary epithelial morphogenesis to an invasive program
of sprouting endothelial angiogenesis. Contrary to the existing invasion models, soluble ligands produced by the
Ô¨Åbroblasts were not sufÔ¨Åcient to trigger invasion. Instead, basal-type invasion relied upon a Cdc42-dependent
reorganization of collagen Ô¨Åbers in the extracellular matrix by Ô¨Åbroblasts. Inhibiting basal-type cell movement
with clinically relevant drugs blocked invasion both in organotypic culture and in animals, suggesting a new
treatment strategy for early-stage patients. Together our Ô¨Åndings establish that Ô¨Åbroblast recruitment by basaltype breast cancer cells into early-stage tumors is sufÔ¨Åcient to trigger their conversion from a benign, noninvasive
DCIS-like stage to a malignant invasive stage. Furthermore, our Ô¨Åndings suggest that different subtypes of breast
cancer may require distinct types of contributions from the microenvironment to undergo malignant progression. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6857‚Äì66. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The progressive loss of epithelial architecture underlies the
development of invasive breast cancer (1). Neoplastic cells Ô¨Årst
accumulate within the lumen of the ductal epithelial bilayer
and later migrate out of the ducts and into the breast stroma
(2). In addition, the Ô¨Åbrous connective tissue is reorganized
around invasive tumors (3), sometimes into linear paths that
intersect with blood vessels (4). So, rather than solitary neoplastic cells charting their own distinct paths out of ducts and
into blood vessels, invasive tumors contain a structural framework that supports the dissemination of tumor cells on identical paths along collagen tracks (5).

The contribution of tumor cells to the induction of invasion
may vary from patient to patient depending on the heterogeneity of primary breast tumors, which can be divided into 5
different subtypes (6). The claudin-low subtype has the characteristics of Ô¨Åbroblasts (7) and can independently accomplish
the tasks required for invasion, including traversing a model
basement membrane (8) and reorganizing collagen Ô¨Åbers into
linear paths for later tumor cells to follow (9). However, the
claudin-low subtype accounts only for 10% of diagnosed breast
cancers (10). The remaining breast cancer subtypes are poorly
invasive when cultured alone (8, 11). Thus, the vast majority of
breast cancers likely require nontumor cells in the microenvironment to trigger invasion and create a structural system
that supports metastatic dissemination (12, 13). Determining
the nature of the cooperation between tumor cells and the
microenvironment that leads to invasion could assist in revealing the risk of metastatic recurrence after surgery and may
identify therapeutic strategies that could thwart the spread of
the disease.

Collection. HCC1143, HCC1806, HCC1954, HCC1569, and
HCC1428 cells (14) were a gift from Michael Peyton and
John Minna [University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center (UTSW)] and validated by Powerplex genotyping
before use. Cells were cultured as described (8, 14). Mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts were isolated from both benign breast
tissue and invasive ductal breast carcinoma cases treated
at UTSW. The tissue samples were minced with a scalpel
and digested with 0.25 mg/mL collagenase I overnight in a
rotary shaker. Mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts were then separated
from the tissue samples by differential centrifugation. The
Ô¨Åbroblasts were grown in 10% FBS/DMEM-F12 and used
within the 17 passages after initial isolation. Cell lines stably
expressing pCLNRX-H2B:GFP and pBABE mCherryCAAX
were generated as described (15). pBOB-GFP (16) and
PGK-H2B:mCherry (17) lentivirus were generated as
described (17). For detailed list of reagents, see Supplementary Methods.
QuantiÔ¨Åcation of invasion
In all experiments, a spheroid was classiÔ¨Åed as invasive if at
least 3 cells collectively invaded away from a main mass of 15 or
more cells. A total of 50 spheroids were counted per condition
in 3 independent experiments.

Real-time imaging of organotypic cultures,
immunoÔ¨Çuorescence, and immunoblot analysis
Cultures were imaged with a PerkinElmer Ultraview ERS
spinning disk confocal microscope enclosed in a 37 C chamber supplemented with humidiÔ¨Åed CO2 (Solent) and a CCD
camera (Orca AG; Hamamatsu). Western blotting and immunostaining were carried out as described (15). ImmunoÔ¨Çourescence images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-E
confocal microscope. For details, see Supplementary Methods.
Xenografts
Female severe combined immunodeÔ¨Åcient mice (purchased
from an in-house vendor) between 6 and 8 weeks of age were
injected in the number 4 fat pad with 50,000 MCFDCIS cells and
200,000 mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts in a 50% Matrigel/DMEM-F12
mixture. Mice were treated daily starting 14 days after fat pad
injection with diluent or 25 mg/mL PD0325901 by oral gavage
and sacriÔ¨Åced on day 21 with CO2 according to UTSW Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Tumors
were removed, Ô¨Åxed in formalin, and embedded in parafÔ¨Ån for
immunohistochemistry by standard protocols. ParafÔ¨Ånembedded tumor slices were stained with the indicated antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Results
Organotypic culture
In each organotypic culture experiment, the breast cancer
cells and Ô¨Åbroblasts were plated in 8-well chamberslides
for immunoÔ¨Çuorescence staining (Falcon) and live imaging
(Nunc) as described (15, 18) with the modiÔ¨Åcations
described in the Supplementary Methods. Organotypic
cultures were immunostained or imaged on the indicated
day of growth.
Fibroblast conditioned media
Fibroblast conditioned medium was generated by plating
Ô¨Åbroblasts in 10% FBS/DMEM-F12. The next day, the Ô¨Åbroblasts were washed twice with PBS and cultured in serum-free
DMEM-F12. After 48 hours, the Ô¨Åbroblast conditioned medium
was removed and supplemented with 2% Matrigel and 5%
horse serum before addition to day 2 organotypic cultures.
Transfection of Ô¨Åbroblasts
A total of 20,000 mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts per well in a 96-well
plate were reverse transfected with RNAiMax (Invitrogen),
using ON-TARGETplus SMART pools (Thermo Fisher ScientiÔ¨Åc). Nontargeting control (001810-10-05) or Cdc42 (J-00505705: CGGAAUAUGUACCGACUGU; J-005057-06: GCAGUCACAGUUAUGAUUG; J-005057-07: GAUGACCCCUCUACUAUUG;
and J-005057-08: CUGCAGGGCAAGAGGAUUA) siRNAs were
used at a Ô¨Ånal concentration of 100 nmol/L. Cdc42 targeting
was conÔ¨Årmed with 2 individual siRNAs from the siGENOME
SMART pool (005057-05 and 005057-07). Mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts
were harvested 24 hours after transfection, and 2,500 Ô¨Åbroblasts were re-plated in organotypic culture for analysis of
Ô¨Åbroblast-induced reorganization of collagen I (5 days after
transfection) or Ô¨Åbroblast-induced tumor cell invasion (7 days
after transfection).

Fibroblast-induced invasion is dependent on breast
cancer intrinsic subtype
Mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts are prominent components of the
tumor microenvironment and accumulate around noninvasive
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions, which are a direct
precursor of invasive breast cancer (1, 19). The ability of
mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts to accelerate the transition from DCIS
to invasive breast cancer in a xenograft model suggests a
functional role for Ô¨Åbroblasts in promoting invasion (20). To
determine how Ô¨Åbroblasts induce breast cancer invasion, we
developed an organotypic coculture model. Organotypic culture models can be used to study the initial steps of invasion
because the breast cancer cells form multicellular spheroids
that reconstitute many features of the primary tumor (18). We
Ô¨Årst investigated the interaction between MCFDCIS cells and
mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts to determine whether our organotypic
model could recapitulate the induction of invasion that is
observed in vivo. Consistent with their behavior in the xenograft model (Fig. 1A), MCFDCIS cells formed multicellular
DCIS-like spheroids that were induced to invade by mammary
Ô¨Åbroblasts in organotypic culture (Fig. 1B and C and Supplementary Fig. S1). With our organotypic coculture model established, we identiÔ¨Åed 7 breast cancer cell lines that formed
noninvasive spheroids with characteristics of human DCIS and
determined whether Ô¨Åbroblasts could induce their invasion. A
subgroup of 4 breast cancer cell lines was induced to invade by
mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts, indicating that they harbored a unique
set of characteristics that permitted Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion (Fig. 1D and E). Consistent with this possibility, the 4
invasive breast cancer cell lines had a basal-like mRNA signature whereas the 3 cell lines that were noninvasive when
cocultured with Ô¨Åbroblasts were classiÔ¨Åed as luminal (8, 21).

Our results suggest that Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion could

Mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts induce the sprouting invasion of
motile neoplastic cells
Although our data indicated that there was a correlation
between the basal intrinsic subtype and the ability of Ô¨Åbroblasts to induce invasion, the mechanism of invasion remained
unknown. The growth of cells beyond the conÔ¨Ånes of the

www.aacrjournals.org

basement membrane can occur either through proliferative
expansion or through migratory collective invasion (23). To
determine whether invasion was driven by proliferative expansion or motile collective invasion, we investigated the behavior
of MCFDCIS spheroids and mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts in real time
at single-cell resolution. We found that MCFDCIS spheroids
contained motile cells that could exchange cell‚Äìcell interacting
partners while migrating within the duct-like spheroid (Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). These motile cells did not
become invasive over time and remained conÔ¨Åned within a

laminin-5‚Äìbased basement membrane (Fig. 1B). This noninvasive motility is similar to the movement that is induced by
the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases
extracellular signal-regulated 1/2 (ERK1/2) in MCF10A mammary epithelial spheroids (15, 24) and during the branching
morphogenesis of mouse mammary epithelial organoids (25).
We term this motility within multicellular lesions "intraspheroid motility" to distinguish it from single-cell migration.
During Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion, the MCFDCIS cells
remained adherent to each other as the Ô¨Årst invasive cell
extended away from the spheroid while converting from an
orientation of lateral and apical contacts to a tip-to-tail orientation (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Movie S3) analogous to
sprouting invasion that occurs during the development of
vascular endothelium (26). The leading cell was then followed
by additional motile cells from the primary spheroid (Fig. 2B
and C, Supplementary Fig. S2, and Supplementary Movies S4,
S5, S6, and S7). Sprouting invasion was the mechanism of
invasion for all spheroids. We did not observe single cells

dissociating from any of the spheroids either during the
initiation of invasion or after cells left the spheroids and
entered the organotypic stroma. Although single-cell motility
requires only directional propulsion (26), our live-imaging
experiments revealed that the invading cells were both motile
and modulated cell‚Äìcell contacts while changing interacting
partners, indicating that the main features of intraspheroid
motility were directly contributing to invasion (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Fig. S2, and Supplementary Movie S7). Invasion did
not correlate with the size of the spheroid, as small lesions
could rapidly invade toward Ô¨Åbroblasts (Supplementary Movie
S8). These results show that Ô¨Åbroblasts induce motile collective invasion.
Intraspheroid motility is a unique property of basal-type
breast cancer cells
To determine whether intraspheroid motility was the basis
for the selectivity of Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion, we imaged
spheroids from 2 basal-type and 2 luminal-type cell lines in real

time. The HCC1806 and HCC1954 spheroids displayed intraspheroid motility, whereas the HCC1428 and T47D spheroids
contained proliferating cells that were not motile (Fig. 3A,
Supplementary Fig. S3, and Supplementary Movies S9, S10, S11,
and S12). When cocultured with Ô¨Åbroblasts, the HCC1954 and
HCC1806 spheroids converted to sprouting invasion and
migrated toward Ô¨Åbroblasts, identical to results obtained in
the MCFDCIS coculture model (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Movies S13, S14, S15, and S16). In contrast, coculturing the
HCC1428 or T47D spheroids with Ô¨Åbroblasts did not induce
either movement of the breast cancer cells or sprouting
invasion (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Movies S17, S18, S19,
and S20). Taken together, our Ô¨Åndings suggest that the induction of invasion requires intraspheroid motility and that
intraspheroid motility is a unique characteristic of basal-type
breast cancer cells.
The ability of cells in the basal-type spheroids to move and
change cell‚Äìcell interacting partners suggested that there was
a reduction in the expression of cell‚Äìcell adhesion proteins in
the basal-type cells, which could serve as biomarkers to identify
motile cells with the potential for Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion.
We analyzed the expression of E-cadherin by Western blotting
and found that there was a modest decrease in the expression
of E-cadherin in the basal-type HCC1954 and HCC1569 cells
compared with the luminal-type HCC1428 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). These results are similar to a previous
comparison of these cell lines and the HCC1143, T47D, and
MCF-7 cells (8). Although the marginal decrease in E-cadherin
expression would likely be difÔ¨Åcult to determine by immuno-

histochemical staining of patient samples, reduced E-cadherin
expression can correlate with a loss of the majority of Ecadherin at the sites of cell‚Äìcell contact (15), which would be
detectable. However, no pronounced difference in E-cadherin
localization was observed when comparing luminal HCC1428
and basal HCC1954 spheroids (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Furthermore, we found that E-cadherin was expressed in the
invading HCC1954 cells and that any detectable E-cadherin
remained localized to the sites of cell‚Äìcell contact when
cocultured with Ô¨Åbroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Although these results indicate that changes in E-cadherin
expression or localization may not be useful tools to predict the
risk of Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion, it is possible that a modest
or transient change in E-cadherin expression at cell‚Äìcell contacts occurs speciÔ¨Åcally in the invading basal-type cells. Consistent with the sustained expression and localization of Ecadherin that was observed, the invading subpopulation of
basal-type cells also retained their epithelial character, as
indicated by the expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecules (Supplementary Fig. S4D; ref. 27). To conÔ¨Årm these
Ô¨Åndings in vivo, we immunostained MCFDCIS xenografts and
found that E-cadherin was expressed at similar levels and at the
sites of cell‚Äìcell contact in the DCIS and invasive lesions,
indicating that Ô¨Åbroblasts do not trigger invasion through Ô¨Årst
inducing a reduction or relocalization of E-cadherin in a large
fraction of the DCIS cells in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S4E).
Taken together, our results indicate that evaluating the expression or localization of E-cadherin or other epithelial differentiation markers will not be sufÔ¨Åcient to determine whether

breast cancer cells are capable of intraspheroid motility or at
risk for Ô¨Åbroblast-induced collective invasion.
Fibroblasts reorganize collagen Ô¨Åbers to induce
collective invasion
Hepatocyte growth factor can induce MCFDCIS invasion
in organotypic culture (28) and Ô¨Åbroblasts can trigger distinct gene expression changes in basal-type breast cancer
cells compared with luminal-type breast cancer cells (29),
suggesting that paracrine signals from the Ô¨Åbroblasts were
inducing invasion. However, we found that the conditioned
medium from mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts was not sufÔ¨Åcient to
induce MCFDCIS invasion in organotypic culture (Fig. 4A
and B). Although these results did not rule out a role for
paracrine signaling in promoting invasion, they did indicate
an additional requirement for Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion.
The collagen in our organotypic cocultures was reorganized
from a lattice-like mesh into linear Ô¨Åbers, which suggested
that the Ô¨Åbroblasts reorganized collagen to induce invasion
(Fig. 4C). Collagen Ô¨Åbers surrounding collectively invading
mammary tumor cells in patient samples (3) and transgenic
mice (30) are reorganized, which indicated that our organotypic culture model was reconstituting a feature of tumor
invasion in vivo. To determine whether collagen reorganization occurred before invasion, we imaged the MCFDCIS
cells, Ô¨Åbroblasts, and Ô¨Çuorescein isothiocyanate‚Äìcollagen in
real time before MCFDCIS invasion. The collagen was indeed
reorganized in areas surrounding the Ô¨Åbroblasts before the
tumor cells invaded, as indicated by the increased local
concentration of collagen (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig.
S5), which is the result of the interaction and contraction of
collagen Ô¨Åbers by Ô¨Åbroblasts (31). The MCFDCIS cells exclusively invaded toward Ô¨Åbroblasts located within areas of
reorganized collagen (Fig. 4D, Supplementary Fig. S5 and
Supplementary Movies S21 and S22). The leading MCFDCIS
cell remained attached to the collectively invading group of
cells (Supplementary Movies S23 and S24), consistent with
our earlier results (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S2, and Supplementary Movies S5, S6, and S7). Rho-family small GTPbinding proteins (G-proteins) regulate Ô¨Åbroblast-mediated
collagen reorganization (31), so we transfected mammary
Ô¨Åbroblasts with siRNAs that target the small G-protein
Cdc42 to determine whether collagen reorganization was
required for invasion. Reduced expression of Cdc42 (Supplementary Fig. S6) was sufÔ¨Åcient to prevent cell elongation
and reduced the degree of reorganization of the collagen
Ô¨Åbers in Ô¨Åbroblasts (Fig. 4E). Correspondingly, invasion was
reduced when HCC1954 cells were cocultured with Ô¨Åbroblasts transfected with Cdc42 siRNAs (Fig. 4F and G). These
results show that Ô¨Åbroblast-mediated collagen reorganization is necessary for basal-type breast cancer invasion in
organotypic culture.
Therapeutic targeting of intraspheroid motility blocks
Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion
The fact that Ô¨Åbroblasts did not induce invasion through the
de novo stimulation of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition
suggested that therapeutic targeting of the intrinsic intras-

pheroid motility of the basal-type breast cancer cell spheroids
could prevent Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion. We previously
found that the activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinases was
sufÔ¨Åcient to induce the intraspheroid motility of MCF10A
human mammary epithelial cells in organotypic culture
(15, 24), suggesting that ERK1/2 activity may be necessary for
intraspheroid motility in the basal-type breast cancer cells. To
determine whether ERK1/2 activity was required for intraspheroid motility and sprouting invasion, we treated MCFDCIS
cocultures with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901. We found
that within 48 hours of treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor,
both the velocity and displacement of cell movement were
reduced (Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Movies S25 and
S26). In addition, treatment with either PD0325901 or the
epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib blocked
Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion of both MCFDCIS and HCC1806
spheroids (Fig. 5C and D and Supplementary Fig S7). Treatment of mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts with PD0325901 or erlotinib did
not alter Ô¨Åbroblast morphology or block collagen reorganization (Supplementary Fig. S8), indicating that the inhibition of
invasion was due to the suppression of cell movement and not
by antagonizing the proinvasive action of the Ô¨Åbroblasts. In
comparison, treatment with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632
reduced Ô¨Åbroblast-induced collagen reorganization (Supplementary Fig. S8), similar to previous Ô¨Åndings (32).
To determine whether ERK1/2 activity was necessary for the
Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion of MCFDCIS cells in vivo, mice
were treated daily with either vehicle or 25 mg/mL of the
MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901 (33) between day 14 and day 21 of
tumor growth. In mice treated with vehicle, mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts induced MCFDCIS invasion by day 21 (Fig. 5E and
Supplementary Fig. S8). In contrast, the tumors in mice treated
with the MEK1/2 inhibitor were both noninvasive and dramatically reduced in size (Fig. 5E and F and Supplementary Fig.
S9). The small lesions in the MEK1/2 inhibitor treated mice
were not invasive; however, we were not able to conclusively
determine whether the blockade of invasion was related to
the suppression of movement or the general growth and
survival of tumor cells. Nevertheless, our data show that
targeting ERK1/2-dependent signaling pathways can prevent
the progression of tumors past small duct-like nodules. Taken
together, our Ô¨Åndings using organotypic culture and xenograft
models indicate that there are overlapping molecular requirements for movement and collective invasion. These results
suggest that clinically approved drugs may be able to delay or
prevent the progression of early-stage tumors into invasive
breast cancer.

Discussion
Here, we Ô¨Ånd that the reorganization of collagen Ô¨Åbers by
mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts creates avenues for invasion that can
be exploited by the motile breast cancer cells in our organotypic culture model. The movement observed in the breast
cancer cells seemed to be triggered by the induction of a
preexisting biological program for mammary gland development (25). The concept of a preexisting biological program contributing to the metastatic cascade has been

for 6 days, immunostained with a-laminin-5 antibody (basement membrane, red), and counterstained with Hoechst (nuclei, blue). Conditioned medium
from the mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts was added on day 2 and day 4. The white arrow identiÔ¨Åes an area of invasion. Scale bars, 100 mm. B, quantiÔ¨Åcation of the
frequency of invasion. Data are the mean  SD.  , P < 0.05 versus no Ô¨Åbroblast control by the t test. C, confocal slices of organotypic cultures
immunostained with anti-collagen I (red) and anti-E-cadherin (green) antibodies and counterstained with Hoechst (nuclei, blue) are shown. A solid
white arrow indicates the direction of invasion, and a dotted white arrow shows a nearby Ô¨Åbroblast. Scale bars, 100 mm. D, confocal slices of MCFDCISmCherryCAAX cells (red) cultured alone or with mammary Ô¨Åbroblasts. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled collagen I is shown in green. The invasion of
MCFDCIS-mCherryCAAX cells at 2-hour intervals over 6 hours total is shown. The area of collagen remodeling, indicated by increased Ô¨Çuorescent
signal intensity, is outlined with a white rectangle. Photobleaching decreases the FITC‚Äìcollagen signal over time. The solid white arrow indicates where the
MCFDCIS cell begins sprouting invasion away from the main spheroid. The dotted white arrow indicates a branch point in the invasion as the MCFDCIS cells
spread through the perpendicular region of reorganized collagen containing a Ô¨Åbroblast. Scale bars, 20 mm. The results are representative of 30
spheroids imaged per condition over 3 independent experiments. E, confocal slices of transfected Ô¨Åbroblasts after 4 days in organotypic culture were
immunostained with anti-collagen I antibody (green) and counterstained with phalloidin (F-actin, red) and Hoechst (nuclei, blue). Scale bars, 100 mm. F,
confocal slices of HCC1954 spheroids cocultured with Ô¨Åbroblasts transfected with the indicated siRNA pools are shown. Cultures were Ô¨Åxed and stained with
phalloidin (F-actin, red) and Hoechst (nuclei, blue) after 6 days of growth. Dashed white arrows identify areas containing Ô¨Åbroblasts. G, quantiÔ¨Åcation
of the frequency of invasion. The mean  range of at least 2 independent experiments is shown.

Figure 5. EGFR and ERK1/2 are necessary for intraspheroid motility and Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion. A, MCFDCIS cocultured with unlabeled Ô¨Åbroblasts were
treated on day 4 and day 6 with diluent or 100 nmol/L PD0325901. Real-time imaging of the MCFDCIS spheroids was carried out on day 6. The movement of
cells over time is indicated by the length of the tracks. The H2B:mCherry‚Äìlabeled nuclei are in red and are located at their respective positions after
8 hours of tracking. The results shown are representative of at least 10 spheroids imaged per condition in 3 independent experiments. Scale bars, 40 mm. B,
quantiÔ¨Åcation of average cell speed in spheroids cocultured with Ô¨Åbroblasts and treated with diluent or 100 nmol/L PD0325901 on day 4 and then
imaged for 14 hours. Data are the mean  SD of 15 spheroids imaged over 3 independent experiments.  , P < 0.05 by the t test. C, MCFDCIS cocultures were
grown for 4 days and then treated with diluent, 100 nmol/L PD0325901, or 1 mmol/L erlotinib. On day 6, the cultures were Ô¨Åxed and immunostained
with a-laminin-5 antibody (green, basement membrane) and counterstained with Hoechst (blue, nuclei). A white arrow identiÔ¨Åes an example area of invasion.
Scale bars, 100 mm. D, quantiÔ¨Åcation of the frequency of invasion for inhibitor treated cocultures. Data are the mean  SD.   , P < 0.01 by the t test
compared with Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion. E, MCFDCIS xenografts were treated daily with either diluent or 25 mg/kg PD0325901 starting on day 14 of tumor
growth until the animals were sacriÔ¨Åced on day 21. ParafÔ¨Ån-embedded tumor sections were immunostained with anti‚Äìsmooth muscle actin antibody.
Representative examples of at least 8 mice per treatment condition are shown. Scale bars, 500 mm. F, quantiÔ¨Åcation of the tumor weights of the control and
PD0325901-treated mice. Mean  SEM is shown.   , P < 0.01 by the t test compared with corresponding diluent-treated control.

previously suggested (34). However, instead of a dramatic
switch from an epithelial to a Ô¨Åbroblast-like phenotype,
which occurs during embryonic development (34), a tissue-speciÔ¨Åc mammary gland branching morphogenesis program was engaged that permits movement within multicellular clusters and the exchange of cell‚Äìcell interacting
partners. A similar type of intraspheroid motility has been
observed during the development of additional epithelial
tissues, such as the salivary gland (35), kidney (36), and lung
(37). Furthermore, intraspheroid motility is an evolutionarily
conserved feature of development that is observed during
the morphogenesis of nonepithelial tissues in mammals (26).
Thus, the direct modulation of intraspheroid motility by
tumor-associated Ô¨Åbroblasts may trigger invasion in multi-

ple tumors types. Consistent with this possibility, motile
squamous carcinoma cells can invade into tracks created by
Ô¨Åbroblasts (38). Like breast cancer, squamous cancer can be
divided into intrinsic subtypes (39). However, whether the
Ô¨Åbroblasts induced the invasion of a speciÔ¨Åc subtype of
squamous cancer was not determined (38). Further investigation is needed to determine whether intraspheroid
motility is a unique feature of intrinsic subtypes in additional carcinomas that makes neoplastic cells exquisitely
sensitive to Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion out of ductal
epithelium.
Our results suggest that the recruitment of Ô¨Åbroblasts to
basal-type DCIS tumors is sufÔ¨Åcient to trigger invasion. In
comparison, luminal-type tumors may require additional

contributions from the microenvironment, such as secreted
factors from macrophages, to promote the intraspheroid
motility that is necessary for invasion. If a more complex series
of events is necessary for luminal-type invasion, basal-type
tumors may progress to invasion more rapidly than luminaltype tumors. An accelerated transition to invasive breast
cancer is consistent with the lack of correlation between
primary tumor size and lymph node involvement in patients
with basal-type breast cancer (40), as well as a greater risk of
future metastasis (22). Further investigation is needed to
precisely deÔ¨Åne the contribution of Ô¨Åbroblast-induced invasion of basal-type breast cancer cells to these known poor
clinical phenotypes and develop new intervention modalities.
