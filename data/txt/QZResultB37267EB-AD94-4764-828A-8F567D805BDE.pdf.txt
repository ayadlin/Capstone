ABSTRACT
Background: We previously showed that growth hormone-releasing hormone
(GHRH) agonists are cardioprotective following myocardial infarction (MI). Here,
our aim was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo activities of highly potent new GHRH
agonists, and elucidate their mechanisms of action in promoting cardiac repair.
Methods and Results: H9c2 cells were cultured in serum-free medium, mimicking
nutritional deprivation. GHRH agonists decreased calcium influx and significantly
improved cell survival. Rats with cardiac infarction were treated with GHRH agonists or
placebo for four weeks. MI size was reduced by selected GHRH agonists (JI-38, MR-356,
MR-409); this accompanied an increased number of cardiac c-kit+ cells, cellular
mitotic divisions, and vascular density. One week post-MI, MR-409 significantly
reduced plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α compared to placebo. Gene
expression studies revealed favorable outcomes of MR-409 treatment partially result
from inhibitory activity on pro-apoptotic molecules and pro-fibrotic systems, and by
elevation of bone morphogenetic proteins.
Conclusions: Treatment with GHRH agonists appears to reduce the inflammatory
responses post-MI and may consequently improve mechanisms of healing and cardiac
remod­eling by regulating pathways involved in fibrosis, apoptosis and cardiac repair.
Patients with cardiac dysfunction could benefit from treatment with novel GHRH agonists.

INTRODUCTION

and dysfunction, suggesting a regenerative process [4, 5].
Most recently, boosting the cardiac reparative capacity
by improving the intrinsic healing process has been
increasingly considered as a novel therapeutic approach
to complement repair deficiencies [25–27]. Accordingly,
our group synthesized and investigated for their biological
activity and cardioprotective effects additional new and
more potent GHRH analogs. By incorporating non-natural
amino acid substitutions into these synthetic analogs, we
have increased their resistance to degradation, and their
physiologic half-life. Thus the new GHRH agonists have
significantly improved endocrine activity and stability
making these agonists even more suitable for use in clinical
settings [28]. The aim of the current study was to evaluate
the in vitro and in vivo activities of these highly potent new
GHRH analogs, and elucidate their mechanisms of action
in promoting and/or enhancing cardiac repair.

Current management of congestive heart failure (HF)
serves to maximize the effectiveness of the remaining heart
tissue in order to maintain an adequate cardiac output.
However, even with the most advanced medical therapies
for HF, morbidity and mortality remain high. Moreover, the
susceptibility of the heart to injury and disease progression
are markedly increased in advanced age. Consistent with
the report from the American Heart Association Statistics
Committee and Stroke Statistics Subcommittee, the
incidence of HF per year rises to ~10 per 1000 population
after 65 years of age [1]. Therefore, novel and innovative
therapeutic approaches are urgently needed.
Besides the well-known renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, other mechanisms play an important
role in the pathophysiology of HF, including those
based on vasopressin, natriuretic peptides, endothelin,
and TNF-α [2]. Secretory events which occur in
cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts play a critical role in the
progression of myocardial remodeling leading to heart
failure [3]. Both of these cell types secrete a variety of
growth factors, cytokines, and hormones that influence
cardiomyocyte growth and fibroblast activation in
paracrine and autocrine manners. Our group reported
recently that receptors for growth hormone-releasing
hormone (GHRH-R) are present on the cell membranes
of both cardiomyocytes [4,  5] and fibroblasts [6], and
mediate the direct effects of this hormone. GHRH itself
functions as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor in benign
conditions [7–15] and various malignancies [16–22].
In addition, agonists of GHRH improve the survival
and growth of many cell types such as pancreatic β cells
[31] and cardiac stem cells (CSCs) [23]. GHRH has also
been shown to stimulate proliferation and migration of
mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro and to accelerate
wound healing in vivo [6].
Recently, Granata et al. found that GHRH promotes
cardiomyocyte survival and protects against ischemia/
reperfusion injury in the isolated rat heart [24]. Our
group has reported that after an experimental MI in rats,
treatment with the GHRH agonist, JI-38, significantly
decreased the degree of subsequent cardiac remodeling

RESULTS
Presence of GHRH ligand and GHRH receptor
in H9c2 rat cardiomyoblast cell line
Reverse-transcribed mRNA from H9c2 cells and
rat pituitary was subjected to RT-PCR. The amplicons for
GHRH (195 bp), GHRH-R (110 bp), and β-actin (133 bp)
were detected at their expected sizes (Figure 1).

Effect of GHRH agonists on H9c2 cell survival
in a nutritionally deprived environment
H9c2 cells were cultured in a nutritionally deprived
environment for 72 hours, their media containing various
GHRH-agonists at 100 nmol/L concentration. Cells in
a serum free medium without any hormonal additions
served as controls. All the tested GHRH-agonists, except
JI-38 and MR-502, significantly improved the viability of
the cardiac cells after 72 hours of starvation, compared
to their control. The survival of H9c2 cells was increased
from 67.8% to 87.3% after the treatment with MR-361,
from 67.8% to 85.8% with MR-367, from 74.5% to 87.6%
with MR-403, and from 74.5% to 85.7% with MR-409
(Figure 2A).

Effect of GHRH agonists on calcium
mobilization in a nutritionally deprived
environment

potentially related to cell death, senescence and cardiac
remodeling. After treatment with MR-409 more than 20
genes in the H9c2 cells exhibited significant transcriptional
change in mRNA expression relative to control, and
also relative to cells cultured in a nutritionally deprived
environment without exposure to GHRH agonists (Table 1).
Importantly, expression of axin-2, cyclin dependent
kinase inhibitor 1A (Cdkn1A), fos-like antigen 1
(Fosl1) and inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) genes
were markedly downregulated (−8.11, −4.99, −7.57
and −6.15 fold, respectively) by MR-409 (Table 1).
Similarly, transcription of genes encoding pro-apoptotic
proteins, including Bcl-2 binding component 3 and
Bcl-2 related protein A1d, was decreased (−3.53 and −14.2
fold, respectively) compared to the control group. We
demonstrated a significant increase (4.53 and 5.98
fold, respectively) in the transcription of genes of bone
morphometric proteins 2 and 4 (BMP2 and BMP4),
respectively, in response to MR-409 treatment (Table 1).
In addition, MR-409 decreased transcription of Serpine-1
gene, which encodes the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1), a protein which is involved in extracellular matrix
(ECM) synthesis and remodeling.

Calcium influx is associated with cell death,
and increase in intracellular calcium indicates ensuing
apoptosis and necrosis. H9c2 cells were kept in a serum
free medium for 72 hours, while they were exposed to
various GHRH agonists at 1 μmol/L concentrations. Cells
cultured in a medium containing FBS served as negative
control, and cardiac cells in a nutritionally deprived
medium, without any treatment, were the positive control.
When compared to the positive control, all the tested
GHRH-agonists significantly decreased the calcium
influx in the H9c2 cells, 175.6% increase in the positive
control vs. 146.3%, 119.1%, 147.9%, 141.3%, 105.1%,
90.2%, and 137.9%, in the cells treated with JI-38, MR356, MR-361, MR-367, MR-403, MR-409, and MR-502,
respectively (Figure 2B). However, two of these analogs,
MR-403 and MR-409, which almost completely inhibited
calcium influx, showed no significant difference when
compared to the negative control.

Effect of GHRH agonists on the expression
of genes responsible for signal transduction
activation and inhibition in H9c2 cell line

Impact of GHRH analogs on myocardium
infarct burden, scar thickness and vessel
formation

We investigated the actions of GHRH and its
signaling in H9c2 cell line to determine mechanisms
responsible for the survival observed in the treated cells.
The Rat Signal Transduction Pathway Finder PCR array
used in our study provided a simple and sensitive tool
for profiling the expression of 84 key genes responsible
for signal transduction pathway activation or inhibition.
We identified important functional molecules affected by
treatment with the GHRH agonists and selected genes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To explore the mechanism by which agonists of
GHRH improve cardiac performance following acute
MI [4, 28], we selected three GHRH agonists (JI-38,
MR-356 and MR-409) and examined their relationship to
proliferative capacity of myocytes, vascular density and
infarct size.
Infarct size was determined by morphometric
measurements [29]. Our previous results [28] showed

that size of the MI was substantially reduced by­
GHRH-agonists, JI-38 (42 ± 1%), MR-356 (37 ± 2.5%)
and MR-409 (42 ± 2.4%) vs. placebo (49 ± 2%, p < 0.05
for all) confirming the agonists’ cardioprotective effect. In
addition, most of the hearts treated with GHRH analogs
showed presence of viable myocardium in the scar area
in contrast to the untreated hearts; in general, the average
infarct wall thickness in the mid ventricle tended to be
thicker than in the placebo group (Figure 3A and 3B).
Next combined isolectin and smooth muscle
22 alpha (SM22A) staining was used to identify arterioles
(Figure 4), since they are of obvious importance for
myocardium perfusion and oxygen supply. All animals

treated with GHRH analogs showed higher vascular
density (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). We also observed an
inverse correlation between infarct size and vascular
density (p = 0.0002, r = −0.7562).

Effect of GHRH agonists on the magnitude of
cardiomyocyte turnover and on cell proliferation
Cardiomyocyte mitotic division and c-kit expression
were assessed by immunofluorescence. Treatment with
GHRH analogs increased the number of endogenous cardiac
c-kit+ cells and the cellular mitotic division (mitotic marker
pH3) in the myocardium (Figure 5A and 5B, respectively).

of GHRH treatment on LV remodeling. Normally,
following MI, pro-inflammatory factors secreted by
cardiac tissue, including cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts,
may amplify cardiac injury and fibrosis [30]. Several
factors are involved in the pathogenesis of maladaptive
cardiac remodeling. Inflammatory reactions, including
those mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) may play important roles in
the progression of CHF. For instance, circulating levels of
interleukin 6 (IL-6) are elevated after MI and are associated
with increased morbidity and mortality [31]. Early
inhibition of inflammatory cytokines in the treated group
may thus preserve myocardial tissue, contribute to more
effective tissue healing with reduced scar tissue formation,
and thereby decrease mortality and morbidity. Importantly,
our results demonstrate that administration of GHRH
agonist, starting two hours after MI, reduces the levels
of circulating inflammatory cytokines (IL2, IL-6 IL-10
and TNF-α) at one-week following MI. These findings
suggest that GHRH-R activation can abolish the feedback
loop of inflammation in the myocardium after ischemia.
We next examined the impact of treatment with these
GHRH analogs on mRNA levels of ECM related genes. Our
data show a substantial upregulation of genes related to the
fibrosis pathway. The main action of TIMPs is to inhibit
MMPs, but several groups have reported that TIMPs also
have cell growth promoting, anti-apoptotic, steroidogenic
and antiangiogenic activities [30, 32, 33], which are in part
independent of their inhibition of MMP. Importantly, both
TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may activate the growth of fibrobasts
in vitro [32–34], in addition to their MMP suppression. Thus,
TIMPs may favor cardiac fibrosis not just by inhibiting
MMPs, but also by separate direct pro-fibrotic mechanisms.
As the use of animals in experimental research is
discouraged, H9c2, a clonal myogenic cell line derived
from embryonic rat heart, has served as a surrogate for
cardiac and skeletal cells and has become an important
tool for toxicology [35] and signal transduction studies

Furthermore, an inverse correlation was identified between
MI size and c-kit expression (p = 0.0084, r = −0.5471) and
cardiomyocyte mitotic division (p = 0.0096, r = −0.5390).

Effect of administration of GHRH on levels of
inflammation-related cytokines post-MI
Next, we investigated the action of GHRH
agonist on the levels of inflammatory cytokines after MI
(Figure 6). One week after starting the treatment with
MR-409, there was a significant reduction in plasma IL-2,
IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in comparison to placebo group
(p < 0.05, n = 3 for each group).

Effects of GHRH agonist therapy on the
expression of genes related to ECM
Relative gene expression levels of tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) and 2 (TIMP-2), collagen
types I and III, and insulin-like growth factor binding
protein 5 (IGFBP5) were assessed by RT-PCR in the
placebo and in the MR-409 groups (Figure 7; Table 2).
Hearts treated with MR-409 showed markedly increased
expression of genes related to ECM (  p < 0.05 vs. placebo),
with the exception of IGFBP5 (  p = ns).

DISCUSSION
This work confirms and extends findings that
GHRH agonists are cardioprotective following myocardial
injury [4, 5, 28] . Consistent with our previous report,
the reductions on MI size by GHRH agonists were
accompanied by an increased number of resident cardiac
c-kit+ cells, an increase in the number of cellular mitotic
divisions in the myocardium, and also by increased
vascular density in the myocardium.
In order to further investigate the mechanisms
involved, we examined the levels of circulating
inflammatory cytokines to elucidate the influence

a significant reduction in plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in comparison to the placebo group (*p < 0.05, n = 3 for each group).

in the heart. Accordingly, our in vitro results show that
treatment of H9c2 cells with GHRH agonists improved
the cell viability in the presence of nutritionally deprived
serum. The survival of the H9c2 cells with GHRH
agonist treatment increased by an average of 22.02%

when compared to the positive control. In addition,
the starvation-induced increase in calcium influx
was abolished by GHRH agonist treatment. Next, we
investigated multiple signal transduction pathways
involved on these effects.

Interestingly, our array data show that axin-2
(a classical target of the canonical Wnt pathway), a negative
regulator of beta-catenin, was suppressed by MR-409,
indicating modulation of the beta-catenin pathway. The
exact role of beta-catenin in adult cardiac remodeling
in vivo is still not understood; however, downregulation of
beta-catenin is required for adaptive cardiac hypertrophy.
mRNA levels of axin-2 were significantly increased
in human fibrotic diseases and in murine experimental
fibrosis [36]. Mastri et al showed that reduction of axin-2
expression, following downregulation of secreted Frizzledrelated protein 2 (sFRP2) by mesenchymal stem cell
therapy and sFRP2 antagonism by antibody blockage,
counteracts the fibrogenic pathway and improves
myocardial injury repair [37]. Accordingly, axin-2 appears
to promote ECM accumulation and fibrosis through the
Wnt-dependent pathway. Our present data thus suggest that
beneficial effects of GHRH agonists on cardiac remodeling
may involve suppression of Wnt signaling; however,
further analysis is required to confirm this mechanism.
Noteworthy, MR-409 markedly suppressed the
expression of Serpine 1. Overall, fibrosis in multiple
tissues has been associated with increased expression of
Serpine 1, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1) [38]. Serpine 1 is an inhibitor of plasmin action
and was shown to be a target of TGF-β1, which implicates
cross-talk between the members of the pro-fibrotic
systems [39]. In addition, elevated levels of PAI-1 are
associated with increased occurrence of thrombosis; and
the decrease in its mRNA level may also protect against
further ischemic events.
Recently, senescent cells are emerging as an
important target in stem cell–based therapies, particularly,
in the elderly population [40]. During the remodeling
phase, senescent cells play a role in limiting scar formation
by dissolving the fibrous proteins placed during the
proliferative phase [41]. MR-409 limited the expression
of Cdkn1A, an age-related gene tightly controlled by the
p53 gene, which can modulate cell-cycle, differentiation,
apoptosis, and senescence [42]. Torella et al [43] reported
that downregulation of this gene can delay organ aging
and heart dysfunction. On the other hand, Li et al [44]
demonstrated that an increase in Cdkl1A expression occurs
with an increase in apoptotic cells in rats with spontaneous
heart failure.
The present findings also identified another factor
related to age, Fosl1, a negative regulator of beta-catenin
that plays an important role in limiting cell proliferation
and differentiation [45]. Fosl1 has been characterized
as a contributor to the AP-1 protein dimer complexes
that regulate extracellular matrix, proliferation, and cell
survival. In the presence of oxidative stress, FOSL1 can
impair cell cycle entry or contribute to apoptosis.
Our data also show an overexpression of BMP2 and
BMP4 genes. Accordingly, Wu et al. has reported that

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

human recombinant BMP4 promotes survival in a cardiac
muscle cell line after H2O2 injury, and also protects adult
mouse cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-reoxygenation
injury [46]. Therefore, this may be another one of the key
mechanisms for the protection of the myocardium by the
agonists.
In conclusion, activation of GHRH receptor in the
heart by GHRH agonists may reduce the inflammatory
response after MI and consequently improve the healing
and cardiac remodeling by regulating pathways involved
in fibrosis, apoptosis and mobilization of progenitor
cells. This leads to significant recovery of the damaged
myocardium and restitution of cardiac function. The
reduction of MI size and increase in the number of mitotic
cardiomyocytes provide evidence that administration of
GHRH agonists enhances myocyte renewal and stimulates
cardiac growth after MI, providing an effective therapeutic
strategy to rescue/repair the infarcted heart. All three
structural classes of the new compounds: methylamide
analogs (MR-406 and MR-409), ethylamide analogs
(MR-420 and MR-421) and C-terminal agmatine analogs
(MR-356) are endowed with important endocrine and
cardioprotective activities, and therefore such agonists
could be useful for therapy of cardiovascular diseases,
targeting specifically fibrogenic pathways.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptides and reagents
In a search for more potent GHRH agonists, we
synthesized, purified, and tested, both in vitro and in vivo,
a series of new human GHRH(1–29) analogs. GHRHagonists JI-38, MR-356, MR-361, MR-367, MR-403,
MR-409, and MR-502 were synthesized by solid phase
methods and purified by reversed-phase high-performance

of the compounds were checked by HPLC before the
experiments. For in vitro studies, the peptides were
dissolved in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) to final
concentrations that did not exceed 0.1%. For in vivo
studies, the peptides were dissolved in 0.1% DMSO in
sterile aqueous 10% propylene glycol (vehicle).

Recently, our group reported the endocrine and
cardioprotective activities of several GHRH agonists
[33]. Based on our findings, we selected tissues from three
groups with enhanced activities in the heart for further
analysis. Plasma (obtained at 1 week post-MI) and basal
portions of hearts, free of fibrotic tissue, were flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen for total RNA isolation. Remaining
tissue was fixed in 10% formalin (EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA) for histology. All animal procedures were
carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health,
revised 2011) and approved by the University of Miami
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Cell line
Rat cardiomyoblast cell line, H9c2, was obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) and maintained in culture using Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagles’s Medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin).
Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified 95% air/5%
CO2 atmosphere.

Total RNA isolation and Reverse TranscriptionPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)

Cell survival assay (MTS assay)

The expression of full-length pituitary GHRH
receptor (pGHRH-R) and GHRH was detected by RT-PCR.
Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin kit (MachereyNagel Inc., Bethlehem, PA). The yield and quality of total
RNA was determined spectrophotometrically using 260 nm
and 260/280 nm ratio, respectively. Genomic DNA was
eliminated using Turbo DNA-free kit (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). One and a half μg of RNA was reverse
transcribed into cDNA with the RevertAid H minus RT Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using a VeritiTM
96-well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). We evaluated the mRNA expression of GHRH-R,
GHRH, and β-actin by using the Go Taq Flexi DNA
polymerase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with primers and
method described previously [4, 47]. Normal rat pituitary
was used as positive control. A sample that contained
DNAse digested RNA and no enzyme during reverse
transcription was used as negative control for RT-PCR.
In addition, total RNA from the remote area of left
ventricle was isolated by the TriZol method (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) as previously described [16]. We determined
the mRNA expression of genes involved in ECM. Samples
tested were obtained from 3–5 independent experiments.

Cells (104/well) were seeded onto 96-well plates
in 100 μl of culture medium containing 10% FBS,
cultured overnight, then starved for 72 hours in a medium
without fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells in starving
medium were exposed to hGHRH(1–29)NH2, or one of
the GHRH agonists JI-38, MR-356, MR-361, MR-367,
MR-403, MR-409, or MR-502, at a concentration of
100 nmol/L. Cell viability was evaluated by using a 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfonphenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (CellTiter
96 Aqueous 1 Solution Cell Proliferation Assay;
Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a
Victor 3 Multilabel Counter (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham,
MD). All experiments were done in quadruplicate and
were repeated 3 times. The inhibition of cell proliferation
was expressed as the percentage of vehicle control (0.1%
DMSO in the culture medium).

Fluorescent assay for calcium mobilization
Cells (104/well) were seeded onto 96-well plates
with 100 μl of culture medium containing 10% FBS,
cultured overnight, then starved for 72 hours in medium
without FBS. Cells in starving medium were exposed to
hGHRH, or one of the GHRH agonists JI-38, MR-356,
MR-361, MR-367, MR-403, MR-409, or MR-502 at a
concentration of 1 μmol/L. Calcium mobilization was
evaluated by using (Fluo-Forte® Calcium Assay Kits,
Enzo Life Sciences, Framingdale, NY) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence intensity
was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths
of 485 nm and 535 nm, respectively, with a Victor
3 Multilabel Counter. Intracellular calcium mobilization
was expressed as a percentage of vehicle control (0.1%
DMSO in the culture medium).

Histology
Slides were prepared with H&E and Masson’s
trichrome stain to assess cardiac structure and the presence
and extent of fibrosis and myocardial scar, respectively.
The infarct size was determined by morphometric
measurements calculated as previously described with
minor modifications [35]. Briefly, MI size was calculated
by dividing the perimeter of the infarcted wall by the total
LV perimeter wall using Adobe Photoshop-CS3 (Adobe
Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). An average of four
sections of each heart was used to measure the infarct
size. To evaluate the scar thickness, we measured the scar

at midventricular level, averaging 3 measurements along
the infarct wall. All measurements were performed blindly
(n = 4–6 for each group) to avoid sampling bias.

Immunofluorescence staining
Heart sections were deparaffinized with xylene
and rehydrated in alcohol series and water as previously
described [4]. Omission of the primary antibodies on
parallel sections was used as negative control. Nuclei
were labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The total numbers
of positively-stained cells at midventricular level were
quantified per slide to calculate the number of cells per
square mm (mm2) on each sample. All images were
obtained with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX81,
Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA) or a LSM710
Zeiss confocal laser-scanning module (Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging, Germany).
Dual fluorescence immunostaining for isolectin
B4 conjugated to Alexa 568 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
and α-SM22A (rabbit polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) followed by donkey anti-rabbit FITC (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was
carried out to quantify arteriole density. The whole heart
section at midventricular level was used for counting
vessel profiles and the vascular density was expressed as
arterioles per square mm (mm2).

Detection of inflammatory cytokines using
ELISA
The panel of inflammatory cytokines was measured
in plasma samples collected from control and MR-409
treated groups at 1 week after treatment (n = 3 for each
group) using the rat cytokine Multi-analyte Elisarray kit
(Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The arrays were performed
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance
was measured at 450 nm within 30 minutes of stopping
the reaction. We measured production of the following
cytokines: IL1α, IL1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL12,
IL13, IFN-γ, TNF-α, granulocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and RANTES.
