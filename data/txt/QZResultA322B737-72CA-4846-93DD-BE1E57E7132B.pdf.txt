Chemotherapy in the United States

BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that thromboprophylaxis is beneficial in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
cancer outpatients, but this is not widely adopted because of incomplete understanding of the contemporary incidence of VTE and
concerns about bleeding. Therefore, the authors examined the incidence and predictors of VTE in ambulatory patients with bladder,
colorectal, lung, ovary, pancreas, or gastric cancers. METHODS: Data were extracted from a large health care claims database of commercially insured patients in the United States between 2004 and 2009. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the cancer
cohort (N ¼ 17,284) and an age/sex-matched, noncancer control cohort were evaluated. VTE incidence was recorded during a
3-month to 12-month follow-up period after the initiation of chemotherapy. Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of VTE and bleeding. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 64 years, and 51% of patients were
women. VTE occurred in 12.6% of the cancer cohort (n ¼ 2170) over 12 months after the initiation of chemotherapy versus 1.4% of controls (n ¼ 237; P < .0001); incidence ranged by cancer type from 19.2% (pancreatic cancer) to 8.2% (bladder cancer). Predictors of
VTE included type of cancer, comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score or obesity), and commonly used specific antineoplastic or supportive care agents (cisplatin, bevacizumab, and erythropoietin). CONCLUSIONS: This large, contemporary, real-world analysis confirmed high rates of VTE in select patients with solid tumors and suggested that the incidence of VTE is high in the real-world
setting. Awareness of the benefits of targeted thromboprophylaxis may result in a clinically significant reduction in the burden of VTE

INTRODUCTION
The association between cancer and venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is well established.1-3 Malignancy is characterized by activation of the coagulation system, and
this prothrombotic state is exacerbated further by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and surgery.4-6 Cancer is 1 of the
most common and important acquired risk factors for VTE,7 and patients with active malignancy have a 4-fold to 7-fold
higher incidence of symptomatic VTE than the general population.8,9
Historically, VTE has been observed most frequently in hospitalized cancer patients admitted for surgery or acute
medical illness.10,11 The risk of cancer-associated VTE varies markedly; however, population-based case-control studies
indicate a 2-year cumulative incidence of 0.6% to 7.8%, depending on the population studied.12-14 This wide variation
reflects the multitude of influences on VTE risk in cancer patients, including disease-related factors (eg, tumor type, disease stage), patient-related factors (eg, comorbidity), and treatment-related factors (eg, chemotherapy, antiangiogenic
therapy).9,15 Systemic chemotherapy increases the risk of VTE 6-fold to 7-fold,16 and the rise in cancer-associated VTE
over recent decades16,17 may have been caused in part by the introduction of therapies with direct effects on the vascular
endothelium.18 It has been demonstrated that thromboprophylaxis is beneficial in reducing VTE in hospitalized, acutely
ill medical patients, including those with cancer.19 Recent large studies have suggested that outpatient thromboprophylaxis also is beneficial in cancer outpatients.20,21 However, outpatient prophylaxis has not been widely adopted clinically
because of an incomplete understanding of contemporary rates of VTE.16,22 In addition, concerns regarding the risk of
bleeding may lead to low compliance with prophylaxis in the cancer population, and little is known about the

contemporary prevalence of bleeding in cancer patients or
the risk factors for bleeding. The primary objective of this
large, retrospective cohort analysis was to examine the
real-world incidence and predictors of VTE in a contemporary cohort of ambulatory patients undergoing current
chemotherapy regimens for select advanced or metastatic
solid tumors compared with an age-matched and sexmatched control population of noncancer patients. We
chose to focus on 6 common solid tumors at high risk of
VTE that were included in recent large studies of thromboprophylaxis.20,21 We also examined the incidence and
predictors of all-cause bleeding events in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

This retrospective, observational cohort study was based
on health care data collected from the IMS/PharMetrics
Patient-Centric database (IMS Health, Inc., New York,
NY) for the period from January 2004 through December
2009. This large database provides integrated enrollment,
medical, and prescription claims information from more
than 90 managed care organizations and Medicare, and it
represents the health services of over 58 million patients
across the United States. It includes both inpatient and
outpatient diagnoses (in International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM]
format) and procedures (in Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition [CPT-4] and Health Care Common
Procedure Coding System [HCPCS] formats) and outpatient prescription records. Additional data elements
include patient demographics (age, sex, US Census Bureau geographic region), health plan type, payer type, provider specialty, and health plan enrollment dates. All
patient records that we used were deidentified in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; therefore, the study was exempt from
institutional review board overview.

‘‘index event identification period’’) were selected from
the database. Receipt of chemotherapy was indicated by
health care claims with relevant National Drug Code
(NDC) or HCPCS codes. For study inclusion, patients
also were required to have continuous medical and prescription drug coverage for 12 months before and 3 to
12 months after their earliest (index) cycle of chemotherapy during the index event identification period. Patients
who received biologic agents alone, in the absence of
chemotherapy, were excluded from the study. Patients
who had a diagnosis of VTE (ICD-9-CM codes 415.1,
451.1, 451.2, 451.81, 451.83, 451.84, 451.9, 453.4,
453.8, and 453.9), severe renal impairment, hemorrhagic
stroke, or thrombocytopenia during the 12-month preindex period, or major bleeding (including gastrointestinal
or ulcer-related bleeding) within the 3-month period immediately before the index date were excluded from the
study. In addition, patients who received antithrombotic/
thrombolytic treatment, as indicated by health care claims
with NDC and HCPCS codes for heparin, enoxaparin,
dalteparin, tinzaparin, fondaparinux, bivalirudin, warfarin, alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, or urokinase <2
weeks before the index date were excluded.
Matched control cohort

Noncancer patients who were selected from the
same database were matched individually (1:1) to cancer
patients on age, sex, geographic region, and medical and
prescription coverage status to form a matched control
cohort. The control cohort served to demonstrate the
magnitude of VTE burden in real-world patients initiating chemotherapy for solid tumors. Each control patient
was assigned the index date of the corresponding matched
cancer patient. Control patients also were required to
have continuous medical and prescription drug coverage
data for 12 months before and 3 months after the
index date.
Data Collection and Outcome Measures

Cohort Selection

Patient characteristics and treatment patterns

Cancer cohort

Information on patient demographics (sex, age,
geographic region, and health plan) and clinical characteristics (medical conditions/comorbidities, Charlson
Comorbidity Index [CCI] [an overall composite measure
of the severity of illness23]), during the 12-month preindex period was collected for both patient cohorts. Medical
conditions/comorbidities of interest included hypertension, stroke/transient ischemic attack, type 2 diabetes,
congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and obesity (all identified
by ICD-9-CM codes).

Patients aged 18 years who had an inpatient diagnosis of malignant neoplasm of the lung (ICD-9-CM
codes 162.0, 162.2-162.5, 162.8, and 162.9), pancreas
(ICD-9-CM codes 157.0-157.4, 157.8, and 157.9), gastrointestinal system (ICD-9-CM codes 151.0-151.6,
151.8, and 151.9), colon/rectum (ICD-9-CM codes
153.0-154.3 and 154.8), bladder (ICD-9-CM codes

Receipt of anticoagulation and cancer therapy over
the 3-month to 12-month postindex period was determined for both patient cohorts. Receipt of anticoagulants
was indicated by the presence of an outpatient health care
claim with an NDC or HCPCS code for heparin, warfarin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, or fondaparinux.
Receipt of cancer therapy was indicated by the corresponding NDC or HCPCS code for cisplatin, doxorubicin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, cetuximab,
erythropoietin, or myeloid growth factors.
Clinical outcomes

Incidence rates of VTE and bleeding events over the
postindex follow-up period were determined from documented outpatient or inpatient claims with relevant ICD9CM, CPT-4, and HCPCS codes. VTE events were separately classified as any VTE event (DVT or PE), DVT
only (ICD-9-CM codes 451.1, 451.2, 451.8, 451.9,
453.4, 453.8, and 453.9), PE only (ICD-9-CM code
415.1), and DVT þ PE, as previously defined.24 Major
bleeding was defined based on clinical input as the presence of appropriate ICD-9-CM codes (431, 432, 767,
767.11, 362.81, 376.32, 377.42, 430, or 719.1-719.19)
or CPT-4 codes (36,430 or 36,455). Minor bleeding was
defined as all other bleeding. Patients who had transfusion
codes alone without diagnostic codes for bleeding events
(based on HCPCS codes) were excluded from counts of
bleeding. Predictors of VTE and bleeding in cancer
patients were determined using a multivariate regression
model that included demographic variables (age, sex,
health plan type) and clinical variables (preindex surgery,
comorbidity, CCI score, cancer type, and index cancer
therapy).
Statistical Analysis

Demographic and clinical characteristics for each patient
cohort were summarized with descriptive statistics. Intercohort comparisons of patient demographic, clinical, and
treatment characteristics and clinical outcomes were performed with Student t tests (continuous variables) and
chi-square tests (categorical variables). A P value < .05
was considered statistically significant. Logistic regression
was performed for a predictor analysis. Statistical analyses
were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Clinical
Characteristics

In total, 63,453 patients who had a diagnosis of bladder,
colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, or gastric cancer who
650

were receiving chemotherapy during the index event identification period were identified from the database. Of
these, 17,284 patients with cancer fulfilled the study
inclusion criteria, with the majority having either lung
(38.9%) or colorectal (26.3%) cancer (Fig. 1). The control cohort comprised 17,284 noncancer patients who
matched the cancer cohort on age, sex, geographic region,
and enrollment status.
The mean age in both cohorts was 63.7 years, and
51.1% of patients were women (Table 1). The mean preindex CCI score was significantly higher in the cancer
cohort than in the control cohort (6.3 vs 0.6; P < .0001),
and the majority of individuals in the cancer cohort had a
CCI score 5 (59.8% vs 1.8% in noncancer controls;
P < .0001). Compared with the noncancer cohort,
patients in the cancer cohort also had a significantly (P <
.0001) higher prevalence of hypertension, stroke, diabetes
mellitus, congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, atrial fibrillation, and obesity (Table 1).
Venous Thromboembolism Incidence and
Predictors

VTE occurred significantly more commonly in the cancer
cohort than in the noncancer cohort over 12 months after
the initiation of chemotherapy (12.6% vs 1.4%; P <
.0001) (Fig. 2). Similarly, the cancer cohort experienced a
significantly higher incidence of DVT only (7.7% vs 1%;
P < .0001), PE only (2.4% vs 0.2%; P < .0001), and
DVT plus PE (2.5% vs 0.2%; P < .0001) compared with
the control cohort. The incidence of VTE differed significantly (P < .0001) across cancer types, with the highest
rates observed in patients with pancreatic cancer (19.2%)
and the lowest rates observed in patients with bladder cancer (8.2%) (Fig. 3). Although DVT was most frequent in
patients with pancreatic cancer (12.6%), PE was most frequent in those with lung (3.6%) and gastric (3.3%) cancer. The majority of VTE events in the cancer cohort
occurred shortly after initiation of chemotherapy: among
the patients with VTE, 18.1% had their first event within
the first month, 47% had their first event within the first
3 months, and 72.5% had their first event within the first
6 months (Fig. 4).

were associated with the greatest risk of VTE (Fig. 5, top).
Bleeding Incidence and Predictors

All-cause bleeding occurred in a significantly greater
proportion of the cancer cohort compared with the noncancer cohort (17.7% vs 7%; P < .0001) during followup. Both major bleeding events (0.9% vs 0.1%; P <
.0001) and minor bleeding events (16.8% vs 6.9%; P <
.0001) were more common in the cancer cohort than in
the control cohort. Predictors of bleeding differed from
predictors of VTE, and bladder cancer (OR, 4.09; 95%
CI, 3.58-4.68; P < .0001), gastric cancer (OR, 2.16; 95%
CI, 1.77-2.65; P < .0001), atrial fibrillation/flutter (OR,
1.46; 95% CI, 1.29-1.65; P < .0001), receipt of erythropoietin (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.48-1.74; P < .0001),
receipt of cetuximab (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.15-1.87; P <
.05), and receipt of bevacizumab (OR, 1.39; 95% CI,
1.23-1.57; P < .0001) were associated with the greatest
risk of bleeding (Fig. 5, bottom).
DISCUSSION
The principal finding of the current population-based
study is the high overall incidence of VTE (12.6%) docuCancer

mented in a large, contemporary, nationally representative, real-world cohort of ambulatory patients who were
initiating conventional chemotherapy for common cancers (lung, gastric, pancreas, colon/rectum, bladder, and
ovary). In this cohort, we identified multiple clinical risk
factors, including specific cancer-associated drug treatments, for VTE (erythropoietin, bevacizumab, and cisplatin) and bleeding (erythropoietin, bevacizumab, and
cetuximab). The study is important because it provides a
contemporary estimate of VTE and bleeding rates in the
ambulatory setting, which is where the vast majority of
cancer care now occurs.
The incidence of cancer-associated VTE reported in
previous epidemiologic studies varies from 0.6% to
7.8%,3,12,13 reflecting differences in patient population,
clinical setting, duration of follow-up, receipt of chemotherapy, method of detecting VTE, and time frame of the
analysis, with a higher incidence reported in more recent
studies. Nevertheless, differences in the time frame do not
fully explain the markedly greater overall incidence of
VTE (12.6%) noted in our study. The PROTECHT
study,21 which enrolled ambulatory cancer patients
between 2003 and 2007, reported an incidence of thromboembolic events (a composite of symptomatic venous or

arm (n ¼ 381) with a treatment duration of 4 months.
Another, more recent clinical trial (SAVE-ONCO), in
which selection criteria similar to those in the current
study were used, reported a rate of thromboembolic
events (a composite of symptomatic DVT, nonfatal PE,
and VTE-related death) of 3.4% in the placebo arm (n ¼
1604) with a median treatment period of 3.5 months.20
In our real-world study, the incidence of VTE among ambulatory patients with cancer over a similar timeframe
(the first 4 months after initiating chemotherapy) was
markedly higher at 7.2%, which may reflect the selection
bias inherent in clinical trials (ie, cancer patients with better performance status and fewer comorbidities) or perhaps geographic differences in surveillance/treatment
(frequency and resolution of scanning, chemotherapeutic
regimens). Alternatively, it is possible that the use of ICD9 diagnosis codes for the identification of patients with

VTE may result in an overestimate of the incidence of
clinical disease. It should be noted, however, that our
choice of ICD-9 diagnosis codes for the identification of
VTE was more selective than the methods used in several
previous database studies of VTE epidemiology.25-28 In
addition, the overwhelming majority of DVT events that
we identified in the database were site-specific, and <5%
of events fell into the ‘‘DVT with unspecified site’’ category (ICD-9 code 451.9). Furthermore, there is a large
body of published literature to substantiate the use of
ICD-9 codes as surrogate diagnostic markers for clinically
documented VTE27-31 and major bleeding32-35 in retrospective claims data analyses.
The SAVE-ONCO and PROTECHT studies also
provided clear evidence that prophylactic pharmacologic
anticoagulation is effective in reducing clinically important VTE in selected cancer outpatients who are receiving
chemotherapy. The SAVE-ONCO study, which was a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial of an ultra-lowCancer

molecular-weight heparin (semuloparin) in patients who
were initiating chemotherapy for common solid tumors,
indicated a significant reduction in the thromboembolic
event rate (1.2% vs 3.4%; P < .001) yet similar rates of
major bleeding (1.2% vs 1.1%) with semuloparin compared with placebo.20 In the PROTECHT study, a lowmolecular-weight heparin (nadroparin) significantly
reduced thromboembolic events compared with placebo
in ambulatory cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy (2.0% vs 3.9%; P ¼ .02). Although PROTECHT
was not powered to assess differences in major bleeding
events between the 2 treatment arms, 5 patients (0.7%) in
the nadroparin group and no patients in the placebo
group had major bleeding events.21
Our observations that the risk of VTE depends
heavily on the primary site of cancer and that pancreatic,
gastric, and lung cancers were significant predictive factors
for developing VTE in this patient cohort are consistent
with earlier epidemiologic findings.10,12,13,17 Similarly,
our identification of erythropoietin, bevacizumab, and
cisplatin therapies as significant predictors for the development of VTE is in accordance with earlier evidence
implicating platinum-based therapy,36,37 erythropoiesisstimulating agents,38,39 and antiangiogenic agents18,40,41
in the pathogenesis of VTE. Furthermore, several risk factors, including obesity, type of cancer, and the receipt of
erythropoietin, further validate variables that were
included in a previously developed predictive model for
chemotherapy-associated VTE.42
In the case of bevacizumab, the impact on the risk of
VTE remains controversial based on data from clinical
trials and meta-analyses.43-45 In the current study, bevacizumab was received by 10.6% of patients across all tumor
types, and it was associated independently with a 1.43Cancer

25% of patients (n ¼ 1135) in the colorectal cancer subcohort from this study, in whom it was associated with a
1.66-fold increase in the risk of VTE.46 In contrast to the
653

Original Article

more controlled environment of clinical trials, our study
addresses the real-world impact of initiating bevacizumab
in ambulatory patients with solid tumors while controlling for other risk factors. It is noteworthy that the US
Food and Drug Administration recently amended the prescribing information for bevacizumab to include concerns
regarding an increased risk of VTE.47
Like VTE, bleeding in cancer patients arises through
the complex interplay of disease-related and treatmentrelated factors. In the current study, the high incidence of
bleeding noted in the cancer cohort (approximately 3-fold
higher than in the control cohort) suggests causes other
than anticoagulation. Unfortunately, we were not able to
adjust for anticoagulation, because antiplatelet therapy
was not accurately captured. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to provide contemporary,
real-world risk factors for bleeding in cancer patients. Predictors for bleeding differed from predictors for VTE. For
instance, the type of cancer with the greatest risk of bleeding was bladder cancer, which had the lowest risk of VTE.
The association of bevacizumab with bleeding is well
documented.47,48 The association of erythropoietin with
bleeding has not previously been reported, but it may be
indicative of the receipt of erythropoietin to treat cancerassociated anemia rather than indicating causality. The
association of cetuximab with bleeding is novel and may
be related to the cancer stage or site (typically, colorectal
or head and neck) for which this agent is used; however,
the association was significant even after adjusting for cancer site. In the context of thromboprophylaxis, it is
encouraging to note that major bleeding rates were not
elevated in recent large clinical trials with the use of
anticoagulation.20,21,49,50
Like all studies that use administrative claims databases, the current investigation has several limitations.
The IMS/PharMetrics Patient-Centric database covers
the commercially insured population and may be unrepresentative of those with government-funded health care
and the uninsured. Information on clinical risk factors for
bleeding and thrombosis (eg, tumor stage, histologic subtype, and leukocyte and platelet counts), duration of
chemotherapy, and anticoagulant/chemotherapy dose was
unavailable. Similarly, the specific details of bleeding
events could not be determined, and it was not possible to
differentiate between symptomatic versus asymptomatic
VTE events. The use of claims data precludes verification
of diagnoses and possibly introduces coding errors.
Despite these limitations, retrospective analyses using
administrative claims data provide valuable information
that reflects contemporary, real-world clinical practice.
654

In conclusion, in the current large, contemporary
analysis, we observed high rates of VTE in patients initiating chemotherapy for solid tumors. The risk of VTE
was 9-fold greater among cancer patients who were
receiving chemotherapy than in noncancer controls. Furthermore, the incidence of VTE (approximately 8%19%, depending on cancer type) reported in this realworld analysis of patients with solid tumors was considerably higher than the incidence reported in recent studies of thromboprophylaxis. Improved awareness on the
part of oncologists of the risks and clinical consequences
of cancer-associated VTE is an essential first step toward
reducing the clinical burden of this condition. Predictors
of VTE differ from predictors of bleeding. Results from
large, randomized studies suggest that outpatient thromboprophylaxis is feasible, safe, and effective. Targeting
cancer patients who have the greatest risk of VTE with
appropriate prophylaxis may reduce the clinical burden
of VTE and its consequences.
