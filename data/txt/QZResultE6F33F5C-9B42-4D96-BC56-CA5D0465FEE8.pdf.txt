BACKGROUND. Few studies have assessed formally whether treatment outcomes
have improved substantially over the years for patients with advanced nonsmall
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) enrolled in Phase III trials. The objective of the current
investigation was to determine the time trends in outcomes for the patients in
those trials.

METHODS. The literature was searched to identify trials that addressed the role of
chemotherapy regimens in the first-line setting for the treatment of advanced
NSCLC. Trends were tested by using multiple regression analysis.

RESULTS. In total, 121 Phase III trials were identified that involved 42,768 patients
with 263 chemotherapy arms and 11 best supportive care (BSC) arms, all of

which were initiated between 1982 and 2002. Although the number of randomized patients and the proportion of patients with metastatic disease had
increased over the years, the number of patients with a poor performance status
who were accrued into the trials had decreased. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy
was been investigated most frequently during the period. The multiple regression
analysis revealed a significant improvement in median survival and in the median time to disease progression over the years, with annual prolongations of
0.1203 months (3.609 days) and 0.0617 months (1.851 days), respectively
(P < .0001 and P < .0130, respectively). In addition, the use of cisplatin and carboplatin was associated significantly with survival prolongation. The median survival for patients who received BSC also increased progressively over the years

CONCLUSIONS. The survival of patients with NSCLC in Phase III trials improved
slowly but steadily over time, although the main factors responsible for this
improvement remain unknown. Nonetheless, the current results also suggested
that novel targets and new agents will be required in the future fight against
advanced NSCLC. Cancer 2007;109:939–48.  2007 American Cancer Society.

n relation to first-line treatment of advanced nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), the results from a meta-analysis that was conducted in 1995 indicated that cisplatin-based chemotherapy produced a modest but significant clinical benefit compared with best
supportive care (BSC) alone in patients with advanced NSCLC.1
Since that meta-analysis, newer antineoplastic agents with novel
mechanisms of action (paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine) have been developed, and Phase III trials of
those agents produced a significant survival advantage in patients
with NSCLC.2 Currently, a combination of cisplatin and 1 of these

newer agents is considered the standard regimen for
these patients.3,4 In addition, carboplatin was developed to help circumvent some of the toxicities of cisplatin and initially was evaluated in clinical trials in
1981.4 Thereafter, several Phase III trials compared
the survival benefit produced by carboplatin-based
chemotherapy with that produced by cisplatin-based
chemotherapy.5,6
More recently, a better understanding of tumor
biology has led to the development of molecular-targeted agents that act on specific molecules involved
in tumor proliferation and survival.7 Some of these
agents were evaluated previously in Phase III trials;
and, when combined with standard chemotherapy
regimens, bevacizumab, an antibody directed against
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), produced
a survival advantage compared with standard chemotherapy alone.8
Thus, currently, it is believed widely that the development of these newer agents has had a significant impact on the treatment of advanced NSCLC
and that the outcomes of patients enrolled in Phase
III trials have improved substantially over the years.
However, in the history of systemic chemotherapy
for advanced NSCLC, few studies have investigated
whether the overall survival of patients with
advanced NSCLC enrolled in randomized Phase III
trials truly has improved over the years. Breathnach
et al. previously investigated the outcomes of 33
Phase III trials of systemic chemotherapy for
advanced NSCLC that were initiated between 1973
and 1994. Their results indicated that patient survival
improved with the passage of time.9 However, the
majority of the trials that were included in their analysis were investigations of older chemotherapeutic
regimens, and they included scarcely any trials that
investigated the efficacy of newer developed agents
or molecular-targeted agents. Thus, the more recent
trends in outcomes from clinical trials for patients
with advanced NSCLC remain unclear.
In another relevant study, Wakelee et al. reported
survival prolongation in patients with advanced
NSCLC after 1990 versus before 1990 by using a database of 3398 patients who were entered on Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Trials.10 This
patient series from a single major oncology group
trial may yield uniform and reliable results; however,
data from all existing Phase III trials that were conducted by various oncology groups may be more representative of the real-world population of patients
with advanced NSCLC, even in the absence of an
individual patient data (IPD)-based analysis. In this
report, we demonstrate the trends in trial characteristics and patient outcomes by using data from 121

Phase III trials that included >40,000 patients and
investigated newer agents, molecular-targeted agents,
and older generation agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search for Trials
We searched for trials that were reported between
January 1991 and May 2006, because previous
reports investigated studies within the past 15 to 20
years.9,10 To avoid publication bias, both published
and unpublished trials were identified through a
computer-based search of the PubMed database and
abstracts from the 10 past conferences of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. We conducted the
search by using the following search terms: lung neoplasm, carcinoma, nonsmall cell, chemotherapy, and
randomized controlled trial. The search also was
guided by a thorough examination of reference lists
from original articles, review articles, relevant books,
and the Physician Data Query registry of clinical
trials.
Selection of Trials
Phase III trials were eligible if they compared firstline, systemic chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC that contained cytotoxic agents or molecular-targeted agents. Trials were excluded if they
only investigated immunotherapy regimens. Trials
that initially were designed to assess combined-modality treatment, including radiotherapy and surgery,
also were considered ineligible.
Data Abstraction
To avoid bias in the data-abstraction process, 2
observers (K.H. and Y.F.) independently abstracted
the data from the trials and subsequently compared
the results. The following information was obtained
from each report: the year of trial initiation (year
when the first patient was accrued), the number of
patients enrolled and randomized, the median age,
the proportion of patients who had a poor performance status (2; defined mainly according to ECOG
or World Health Organization criteria), the proportion of patients who were women, the proportion of
patients with stage IV disease (mostly defined
according to published staging criteria11,12), the
chemotherapy regimen, the median survival, and the
median time to progression (TTP) (per treatment
arm). In the data-abstraction process for each trial
that we identified, if the trial had none of the relevant information mentioned above, then the trial
was excluded from the analysis for that information.
In addition, for each trial, data defined according to

Phase III Trial and Survival in Lung CA/Hotta et al.

941

criteria that varied from that mentioned above also
were considered nonevaluable. Docetaxel, paclitaxel,
vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and irinotecan were defined as newer chemotherapeutic agents.13 Drugs
that reportedly act on known specific molecular targets, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, neutralizing
antibodies, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, and
antisense oligonucleotides were defined as molecular-targeted agents.7 All data were checked for internal consistency, and disagreements were resolved by
discussion among the investigators.

Quantitative Data Synthesis
The Kruskall-Wallis test and chi-square tests were
used for comparisons among groups, as appropriate.
Data from Phase III trials were evaluated by using
multiple, stepwise regression analysis (with the following stepping method criteria: probability of F to
enter the model, .05; to remove from the model,
.10). The data analyzed included the year of trial
initiation, cisplatin use, carboplatin, newer agents,
molecular-targeted agents, the number of agents
combined, the number of randomized patients, the
median patient age, the proportion of patients with a
poor performance status, the proportion of women
patients, and the proportion of patients with stage IV
disease. These data were used to determine whether
each factor had an independent impact on the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC who were
treated on the Phase III studies over time. All P
values corresponded to 2-sided tests, and significance was set at a P value <.05.

RESULTS
Trial Flow and Trends in the Characteristics
of Eligible Trials
A time chart of this study is shown in Figure 1. In
total, 121 trials that involved 42,768 patients with
advanced NSCLC were identified by the computerbased and manual searches for relevant articles,
abstracts, and references. Of the 42,768 enrolled
patients, 40,894 patients were allocated randomly to
263 chemotherapy arms, and 1167 patients were allocated to 11 BSC alone arms. The baseline characteristics of the trials are listed in Table 1. The trials
were initiated between 1982 and 2002, and the 121
trials were divided simply into 3 generations on the
basis of the year of trial initiation. Each period was
considered as follows: the early period, when mainly
old cytotoxic agents and cisplatin were investigated
(1982–1988); the middle period, when new cytotoxic
agents and carboplatin were introduced into Phase

III trials (1989–1995); and the late period, when molecular-targeted agents were introduced into Phase
III trials (1996–2002). Although we observed that the
number of randomized patients per trial and the proportions of patients with stage IV disease increased
with the passage of time during the study period
(Kruskall-Wallis test; P < .0001 and P < .0412, respectively) (Fig. 2A,B), the proportion of patients with a
poor performance status decreased during the same
period (P < .0001) (Fig. 2C). Conversely, the proportion of patients who were women remained consistent over the years (P ¼ .1991) (Fig. 2D).

the most frequently investigated regimens throughout the study period (61%), as expected, although
the proportion of this type of regimen investigated in
Phase III trials decreased during the study period
(chi-square test; P ¼ .0055) (Fig. 3). However, combinations of cisplatin with the newer agents have been
studied increasingly with the passage of time
(P < .0001). There were few Phase III trials that evaluated carboplatin-based chemotherapy before 1995;
however, thereafter, it has been investigated extensively (P < .0001). Nonplatinum chemotherapy with
newer agents also was evaluated increasingly over
the observed period (P < .0001). Molecular-targeted
agents combined with chemotherapy were investigated in 10 arms. All of those trials were initiated
after 1999.

Trend in Survival for Patients in the Chemotherapy Arms
Data on survival were available from all 121 trials
with 263 chemotherapy arms. For the current study,
we analyzed survival data from each treatment arm
and, first, assessed the associations between several
clinical patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. Results of the univariate analysis revealed a
significant association between median survival and
the percentage of patients with a poor performance
status (P < .0001), as expected.
Next, we focused on trends in the survival of
patients who were allocated to the chemotherapy
arms over the entire study period. The median survival was 7.3 months (range, 4.8–12.0 months) in the
early period and 9.0 months (range, 5.1–12.2 months)
in the middle period; whereas. in the late period, it

943

was 9.3 months (range, 4.2–14.8 months). The median survival for each chemotherapeutic regimen
also is listed in Table 2. Overall, the regimens that
contained cisplatin combined with newer agents or
molecular-targeted agents seemed to yield favorable
overall survival. A scattergram of the 2 parameters,
ie, the year of trial initiation and median survival in
263 chemotherapy arms, demonstrates the progressive improvement in median survival for patients
with advanced NSCLC who were enrolled in Phase
III trials over the years (P < .0001) (Fig. 4). The
results of a multiple, stepwise, linear regression analysis showed a significant association between the
year of trial initiation (more recent years) and longer
median survival (an increase of 0.1203 months [3.609
days] per year; P < .0001) (Table 3). In addition, the
use of cisplatin and carboplatin and the proportion
of patients with a poor performance status and with
stage IV disease affected median survival significantly, as reported previously.14,15
The median TTP was 3.2 months (range, 1.8–6.0
months) in the early period, 4.9 months (range, 1.9–
8.5 months) in the middle period, and 5 months
(range, 2.1–9.0 months) in the late period. Thus, the
median TTP for patients with NSCLC who were enrolled in Phase III trials also improved progressively
over the years (P ¼ .0267). The multivariate analysis
also revealed that the year of trial initiation significantly influenced the median TTP, with an increase
of 0.0617 months (1.851 days) per year (P ¼ .0130)
(Table 4). The use of cisplatin, the use of carboplatin,
and the proportion of patients who were women and
patients with stage IV disease also were associated
significantly with the median TTP.

Survival of Patients in the BSC Alone Arms
We also evaluated the survival of 1167 patients who
were allocated to the BSC arms, which had not been
investigated fully. Their median survival was 4.8
months (range, 2.4–5.9 months). We also observed
that the median survival of patients who were allocated to the BSC arms was associated significantly
with the year of trial initiation (P ¼ .0487) (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
The current results demonstrated a slow but steady
improvement in patient outcomes over the years
in Phase III trials of systemic chemotherapy for
advanced NSCLC performed by various oncology
groups around the world, with an increase of 0.1203
months (3.609 days) per year. Our results were consistent with those from a previous IPD-based analysis of ECOG trials, which reported improved survival
in more recent NSCLC trials.10 Breathnach et al., who
investigated the changes in trial characteristics and
outcomes of 33 Phase III trials that were initiated
from 1973 to 1994 in North America, reported an
improvement in survival over time (P ¼ .0214), with

an increase of approximately 0.1 month per year,9
which also was consistent with our study results.
Thus, the outcomes of patients with advanced
NSCLC from around the world who were enrolled in
Phase III trials, along with the outcomes of patients
entered on trials that were conducted in North America, seem to have improved consistently over the
years.
Breathnach et al. also noted that platinum-based
therapy was associated independently with survival
prolongation (P ¼ .0318).9 Wakelee et al. observed a
significant survival advantage from cisplatin in their
patients with NSCLC (hazard ratio, 0.882; P < .0001).10
In addition, we observed a significant survival benefit
from cisplatin-based regimens compared with noncisplatin-containing regimens irrespective of the year of
trial initiation (an increase of 0.9631 months [28.89
days] with cisplatin; P < .0001) (Table 3). These findings were consistent with the results from 2 metaanalyses, which indicated a survival advantage of cisplatin-based chemotherapy over nonplatinum-based
chemotherapy16 and BSC alone.1 Based previous
reports10 and our own results, we conclude that cisplatin should remain the key agent for the treatment
of patients with advanced NSCLC and that the introduction and frequent use of cisplatin in Phase III
trials have clearly contributed to the survival improvement in these patients over the years.
Carboplatin was assessed frequently in the late
period of the current study (Table 2) and independently yielded a significant survival advantage, with a
survival increase of 0.6777 months (20.33 days) associated with its use according to our multivariate
results (P ¼ .0400) (Table 3). Thus, the introduction

of carboplatin into Phase III trials also may have
contributed to improved treatment outcomes over
the years, especially in the late period of this study.
The survival prolongation observed with the use of
carboplatin, however, seemed to be shorter than that
observed with the use of cisplatin, as observed in
several randomized Phase III trials of cisplatin/carboplatin and in a recent meta-analysis6,17,18; the
TAX326 study, 1 of these large Phase III trials, indicated a trend toward improved survival in the docetaxel plus cisplatin arm compared with the docetaxel
plus carboplatin arm, although that trial was
designed to compare the 2 docetaxel arms not with
each other but with the comparator vinorelbine plus
cisplatin arm.
Newer cytotoxic agents were introduced in the
early 1990s and now are common doublet partners
with the platinums in the treatment of NSCLC.
Indeed, we found that they were investigated frequently in the middle and late periods of this study
(Table 2). These agents also are tolerated better than
the platinums and exhibit single-agent activity.2
Indeed, several recent Phase III trials that compared

Thus, initially, we speculated that regimens containing the newer agents administered as first-line chemotherapy could yield a significant survival advantage
over regimens that did not contain these agents;
however, we failed to confirm that speculation in the
current study (Table 3), which either may reflect on
their genuine antitumor activity or simply may represent a chance observation. In addition, although it
remains a matter of speculation, these newer cytotoxic agents may offer better antitumor activity in
the second-line setting than in the first-line setting:
Wakelee et al. demonstrated an increase in the interval from the date of disease progression after the
administration of first-line chemotherapy to death
with the passage of time during their study period
(2.7 months before 1990 vs 4.2 months after 1990)10
in fact, and recent studies have demonstrated that
second-line regimens indeed can improve survival.21,22
In the first-line setting, the use of molecular-targeted agents was not associated with survival prolongation (Table 3); therefore, those agents did not seem
to contribute directly to the improvement of patient
survival over the study period. This observation contradicts a recent report that bevacizumab prolonged
survival when it was combined with chemotherapy.8
The discordance may be attributable mainly to the

Phase III Trial and Survival in Lung CA/Hotta et al.

limited number of trials of molecular-targeted agents
that were included in our analyses; in addition, the
results reported were somewhat premature. It is
worth noting that we assessed all molecular-targeted
agents together in our study, although these agents
have different mechanisms of action7; and, theoretically, different target patient populations would benefit most from different molecular-targeted agents.
Unlike cytotoxic agents, the therapeutic potential of
molecular-targeted agents should be evaluated further and stratified at least according to the types of
agents with similar target molecules (ie, epidermal
growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
antibodies to VEGF, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, etc) or according to the populations most likely
to benefit from these agents in the future.
There may be several confounding factors in the
current study other than the development of newer
chemotherapeutic agents that may have contributed
to the prolongation of survival observed with the
passage of time, such as improved supportive care,
general medical management of cancer patients,
more selective inclusion criteria for the more recent
trials, stage migration because of improved surgical
and imaging staging techniques, and potential leadtime bias.9,23,24 Indeed, the median survival of
patients allocated to the BSC alone arms in the
Phase III trials also appeared to have increased during the observation period despite the very small
sample size, and the fitted lines of the chemotherapy
arms and the BSC alone arms were nearly parallel
(Fig. 4). Surely, considerable progress has been made
in supportive care, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factors for febrile neutropenia and sepsis
after the administration of chemotherapeutic agents,
intrabronchial stents for fatal bronchial stenosis
caused by tumor, and bisphosphonates for hypercalcemia.25,26 Furthermore, the performance status of
patients enrolled in Phase III trials has become more
selective; consequently, there has been a decrease in
the number of patients with a poor performance status accrued to Phase III trials (Table 1, Fig. 2). We
also observed an increase in the percentage of
patients with stage IV disease enrolled in Phase III
trials, which may be attributable to stage migration.23
Thus, the numbers of patients expected to have a
favorable prognosis that were accrued to chemotherapy trials may have increased over the years. With
regard to potential lead-time bias,23,24 patients who
were enrolled in the later period were more likely to
have been treated earlier in the natural history of
their disease not only because of the improved staging techniques but also because systemic chemotherapy was initiated more quickly once it was

947

understood that patients with advanced NSCLC
would benefit from it. In addition, experimental regimens may have been adopted as either control and
or experimental treatment arms in subsequent trials.
All of these factors may complicate interpretation of
the true impact on patient survival of improvements
in the activity of chemotherapeutic drugs during the
study period.
In this study, we used only Phase III trial data
and no Phase II trial data; because, in Phase III trials,
patient survival is evaluated as the primary endpoint,
and, in general, very large patient cohorts are followed over longer periods. These possible advantages
of Phase III trials may be expected to yield a more
reliable and accurate assessment of the median survival and the TTP. In addition, we categorized all 121
trials that we identified through the search into 3
periods stratified by the year initiated; although, in
the process of literature search in our study, we did
not intend to search for trials by the year initiated
but by the year reported. Because this procedure
possibly may have led to biased results when we
assessed the trends in trial characteristics and patient
outcomes, our results should be interpreted with
caution.
In conclusion, the results of our analysis clearly
suggest that, regardless of the reason, the survival of
patients with advanced NSCLC who were enrolled in
Phase III trials improved significantly over the years.
However, this improvement still is only very modest,
indicating clearly that patient management remains
unsatisfactory and that novel targets, newer agents,
and comprehensive patient care will be essential in
the future fight against lung cancer.
