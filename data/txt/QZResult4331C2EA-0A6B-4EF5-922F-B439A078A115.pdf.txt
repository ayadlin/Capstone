Abstract
The estrogen receptor-a (ERa) determines the phenotype of breast cancers where it serves as a positive
prognostic indicator. ERa is a well-established target for breast cancer therapy, but strategies to target its
function remain of interest to address therapeutic resistance and further improve treatment. Recent findings
indicate that proteasome inhibition can regulate estrogen-induced transcription, but how ERa function might
be regulated was uncertain. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome-wide effects of the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib on estrogen-regulated transcription in MCF7 human breast cancer cells and showed that
bortezomib caused a specific global decrease in estrogen-induced gene expression. This effect was specific
because gene expression induced by the glucocorticoid receptor was unaffected by bortezomib. Surprisingly, we
observed no changes in ERa recruitment or assembly of its transcriptional activation complex on ERa target
genes. Instead, we found that proteasome inhibition caused a global decrease in histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1), leading to transcriptional elongation defects on estrogen target genes and to decreased
chromatin dynamics overall. In confirming the functional significance of this link, we showed that RNA
interference–mediated knockdown of the H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF40 decreased ERa-induced gene transcription. Surprisingly, RNF40 knockdown also supported estrogen-independent cell proliferation and activation of
cell survival signaling pathways. Most importantly, we found that H2Bub1 levels decrease during tumor
progression. H2Bub1 was abundant in normal mammary epithelium and benign breast tumors but absent
in most malignant and metastatic breast cancers. Taken together, our findings show how ERa activity is blunted
by bortezomib treatment as a result of reducing the downstream ubiquitin-dependent function of H2Bub1. In
supporting a tumor suppressor role for H2Bub1 in breast cancer, our findings offer a rational basis to pursue
H2Bub1-based therapies for future management of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5739–53. 2011 AACR.

of physiologic processes, including development, fertility,
cardiovascular function, and bone metabolism (1), by
inducing rapid and dramatic changes in gene expression.
Importantly, over two thirds of breast tumors express ERa
and depend upon its activity for their growth (1, 2). As such,
antiestrogen therapies such as tamoxifen, fulvestrant (Faslodex), and aromatase inhibitors have become standard treatments for ERa-positive breast cancer. Nevertheless, about
one third of ERa-positive breast cancers become resistant
to antiestrogen therapy and develop into more aggressive
hormone-independent tumors (3). Thus, more effective
therapies which act on additional aspects of ERa function
may help to eliminate ERa-positive tumors at an earlier
stage and increase overall patient survival (4).
One potential target of breast cancer therapy may be the
ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS; ref. 5). The conjugation of
multiple ubiquitin moieties (polyubiquitination) linked to one
another through lysine residue 48 (K48) of ubiquitin generally
lead to the degradation of the target protein by the 26S
proteasome (6). Ubiquitination is carried out by ubiquitin
ligases which frequently contain either RING or HECT

domains. Several ubiquitin ligases, such as RNF12 (7), have
been shown to bind directly to ERa and regulate its activity.
Furthermore, a number of studies have suggested that proteasome inhibition alters ERa-dependent gene transcription,
although different effects and mechanisms have been suggested (8–12). Proposed mechanisms of action for proteasome
inhibition included decreased ERa mobility within the
nucleus (10, 11) and decreased ERa binding and recruitment
of cofactors (10). In addition, changes in RNA polymerase
(RNAP) II phosphorylation have been observed following
proteasome inhibition (13). However, most of these studies
utilized the laboratory proteasome inhibitor MG132, which is
not suitable for clinical use, and were mostly based on the
investigation of a limited number of target genes.
Recently, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade)
was shown to be safe for clinical use (14) and was approved by
the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma (15). Although clinical
trials for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer were
initially disappointing when used as a single agent (14), a
new study combining the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant with
bortezomib suggests that the combination of antiestrogen
therapies with proteasome inhibition may indeed increase
treatment efficacy (16). In line with these results, clinical trials
utilizing the combination of bortezomib and fulvestrant are
currently underway for the treatment of ER-positive metastatic tumors in postmenopausal patients (NCT01142401).
Therefore, a more complete understanding of the effects
of proteasome inhibition on ERa activity are essential for
assessing the molecular mechanisms involved and determining which types of tumors (i.e., nonmetastatic vs. metastatic;
ERa-positive vs. ERa-negative) may respond better to proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib.
In this study, we sought to determine the effects of the
clinically safe proteasome inhibitor bortezomib on the rapid
induction of estrogen-regulated gene transcription in MCF7
breast cancer cells. We provide evidence that bortezomib
blocks estrogen-induced gene transcription by a unique posttranscriptional initiation mechanism involving a loss of histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) and changes in
chromatin dynamics. Moreover, we observe a dramatic loss
of H2Bub1 during tumor progression which may lead to
estrogen-independent cell proliferation and increased metastatic properties.

Methods
Cell culture, transfections, and siRNAs
MCF7 cells were obtained from K. Pantel (University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and A549 cells
were obtained from M. Dobbelstein (University of G€
ottingen).
Both cell lines were grown in phenol red–free high-glucose
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (Thermo Scientific). The identity of both the cell lines was routinely verified
microscopically on the basis of cellular morphology and the
expression of ERa and estrogen responsiveness (for MCF7
cells). Prior to hormone treatments, MCF7 and A549 cells were

grown in DMEM containing 5% charcoal-dextran–treated FBS
(CSS; HyClone) 1 to 2 days prior to treatment with 10 nmol/L
17b-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) or 100 nmol/L dexamethasone
(Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, as indicated. For blocking proteasome activity, cells were pretreated for 15 minutes with 1 of
the 3 following chemical proteasome inhibitors: 50 nmol/L
bortezomib (LC Laboratories), 20 mmol/L MG132 (Biomol), or
1 mmol/L epoxomicin (Biomol). MCF10A cells were obtained
from M. Oren (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel)
and grown in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 5%
horse serum (Sigma), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF;
Sigma), 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma), 0.1 mg/mL cholera
toxin (Sigma), and 10 mg/mL insulin (Sigma). Cellular identity
was regularly verified microscopically on the basis of cell
morphology. Transfections were done using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for siRNAs and Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) for plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's
instructions. siRNAs are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Chromatin fractionation, Western blot, and tissue
microarray analysis
Chromatin fractionation was done as described (17) and
analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies and dilutions
listed in Supplementary Table S6. Tissue microarray analyses
were carried out essentially as described previously (7, 18)
with the modifications listed in Supplementary Methods using
the newly generated anti-H2Bub1 mouse monoclonal antibody 7B4 and the tissue microarrays BR8010 and BR951
(Biomax) containing normal mammary epithelial tissue samples, as well as benign, malignant, and metastatic samples.
Cell migration, colony formation, and apoptosis assay
Cell migration was assayed by seeding 100,000 MCF10A
cells 48 hours after transfection with the respective siRNAs
into 8.0-mm PET track-etched membrane cell culture inserts
(BD Bioscience). Cells were grown for another 48 hours before
fixation with methanol for 10 minutes. Migrated cells were
visualized by crystal violet staining [0.1% (w/v) crystal violet,
10% (v/v) formaldehyde] for 10 minutes. For determining
proliferative capacity, 20,000 MCF7 cells were plated in normal
growth medium which was replaced 10 hours later by hormone-deprived medium. Cells were treated with 17b-estradiol
for 7 days. Subsequently, colonies were fixed with 70% methanol for 30 minutes on ice before staining with crystal violet
solution for 2 hours. Apoptosis was analyzed using the Guava
Nexin Assay (Guava Technologies, Millipore) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
For fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
analyses, MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with a
plasmid in which the open reading frame of ERa was cloned
in frame into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech Laboratories)
and grown for 48 hours in estrogen-free medium before
conducting analyses. Eight-bit time lapse images of cells were
acquired at a frame rate of 3 frames per second with a confocal
microscope setup and its software (TCS SP2 AOBS; Leica) with
a 40 oil immersion objective (Type HCX PL Apo CS, NA 1.25;

Leica). The pinhole was set at 81.40 mm and the zoom factor
was adjusted to obtain 62.5  62.5 mm2 images with voxel size
of 244.26  244.26 nm2. After recording 10 images, the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in a 13.2  2.9 mm2 region
within a nucleus was bleached with a 488-nm laser beam and
120 postbleaching images were taken. To correct the intensity
from imaging bleaching and background signal in the
bleached region of the postbleaching series, the formula

 Iref ðtÞ  Ibg
Icorr ðtÞ ¼ Iori ðtÞ  Ibg 
Iref ð0Þ  Ibg
was used, where Icorr (t) represents the corrected intensity at a
certain time point; Iori represents the original intensity; Ibg is
the average background signal in the series; and Iref is the GFP
signal from another nucleus in the same image field used for
measuring the GFP bleaching from image acquisition. The
fluorescence recovery of the bleached region was then fitted
with a simple exponential function using the SigmaPlot (Systat
t

Software) with 3 variables, Itheor ðtÞ ¼ y0  a  e b , where y0
is the theoretical maximum intensity and b is the time
constant. The Welchs two-sample t test was carried out using
the free statistical software R (19) for statistical computing
and graphics to evaluate the significance of the data.
Gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and
quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was isolated from cells with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One
microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random
nonamer primers (Metabion). Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) and subsequent real-time PCR analyses were conducted
essentially as previously described (7, 20) with modifications
described in Supplementary Methods and the antibodies listed
in Supplementary Table S6. ChIP and input samples were
quantified using a standard curve made from ChIP input
DNA. ChIP samples were normalized to their corresponding
input samples and expressed as "percent input." cDNA samples
were quantified using a standard curve made from all cDNA
samples. Prior to statistical analysis, all quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) samples were normalized to an internal reference gene (28S ribosomal RNA or hnRNPK). The expression
levels were determined relative to the vehicle-treated control
sample and expressed as "relative mRNA expression."
Microarray analyses
Total RNA for microarray experiments was isolated and
transcriptome-wide gene expression analysis was conducted
on samples treated for 24 hours using GeneChip Human Gene
1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix) carried out at the Transcriptome
Analysis Laboratory, University of G€
ottingen. For mRNA expression profiling after 6-hour treatments, RNA samples were prepared in the same way and Illumina whole-genome gene
expression analysis using a human HT-12 v4 beadchip was
conducted by the Vancouver Prostate Centre Laboratory for
Advanced Genome Analysis, Vancouver, Canada. Gene expression data were analyzed using log2 transformation and quantile
normalization of expression levels (21). To determine significant
differences of expression levels between the different groups, a

www.aacrjournals.org

moderated Student's t test was computed on a gene-by-gene
basis using the empirical Bayes statistics in the "LIMMA"
package (22). To avoid a high number of false positives and
to stay below a false discovery rate of 5%, P values were adjusted
for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method
(23). All analyses were conducted using the free statistical
software R (version 2.12.2; ref. 19). All gene expression data
have been deposited into the Geo Expression Omnibus repository under the accession numbers GSE30931 and GSE31118.
Chromosome conformation capture
Chromosome conformation capture (3C) analysis was done
as described (24) with the modifications described in the
Supplementary Methods section. For comparison of interactions, DNA derived from bacterial artificial chromosome
clones (BAC information in Supplementary Table S5) was
isolated, digested, and ligated similarly to 3C samples and
used for serial dilutions and quantitative analyses essentially
as described (25). qRT-PCR analysis is described in Supplementary Methods. 3C values were normalized with values
from an amplicon located between restriction sites to control
for equal amounts of input DNA. The normalized levels were
graphed relative to the nontreated control sample (set to 1)
and represented as "normalized relative interaction."

Results
Bortezomib blocks proteasome activity in MCF7 breast
cancer cells
To investigate the effects of a clinically utilized proteasome
inhibitor on ERa activity, we validated the ability of bortezomib to block proteasome activity and determined the
optimal concentration of bortezomib for blocking proteasome
activity in ERa-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S1A, bortezomib effectively increased
polyubiquitination of cellular proteins already at a concentration of 10 nmol/L and exhibited a similar efficiency to that of
the laboratory proteasome inhibitors MG132 and epoxomicin
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Knockdown of the proteasome
subunits PSMB3 or PSMB5 induced a similar accumulation
of polyubiquitinated proteins compared with bortezomib
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Surprisingly, in contrast
to previous reports (16, 26), whereas bortezomib effectively
decreased estrogen-induced proteasomal degradation of ERa
(Supplementary Fig. S1D) in a manner similar to that reported
for MG132 (9, 27), we observed little or no effect of bortezomib
on fulvestrant-induced ERa downregulation (Supplementary
Fig. S1E).
Bortezomib does not affect RNAPII carboxy-terminal
domain phosphorylation and only mildly impairs ERa
nuclear mobility
A previous study suggested that proteasome inhibition
affected glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated transcription
by increasing the global phosphorylation of the RNAPII
carboxy-terminal domain (CTD; ref. 13). Therefore, we tested
whether bortezomib treatment also affects RNAPII phosphorylation in MCF7 cells. However, as shown in Figure 1A, no

major changes in the phosphorylation of any of the commonly
phosphorylated residues (Ser2, Ser5, or Ser7) of the RNAPII
CTD were observed following bortezomib treatment.
Decreased nuclear mobility of ERa following proteasome
inhibition was also proposed as a mechanism by which
MG132 treatment impairs ERa binding to target genes
and estrogen-regulated transcription (10, 11). We substantiated these data using FRAP where we observed a dramatic
decrease in ERa mobility following MG132 treatment with
essentially no recovery observed up to 30 seconds after
photobleaching (Fig. 1B). However, in comparison to
MG132, bortezomib only mildly decreased ERa mobility
(Fig. 1C), with effects more similar to those of estrogen.

To test for secondary effects caused by the induction of
apoptosis, we investigated the effects of 24- or 48-hour bortezomib treatment and transfection of siRNAs against the

apoptosis in MCF7 cells. Only after prolonged bortezomib
treatment (48 hours) were apoptotic effects observed. Therefore, all subsequent experiments were carried out at time
points of 24 hours or less.
Bortezomib blocks estrogen-induced gene expression
To determine the transcriptome-wide effects of bortezomib
treatment on estrogen-regulated gene expression, we carried
out microarray analyses using MCF7 cells treated with estrogen alone or a combination of bortezomib and estrogen for
either 24 hours (Fig. 2A and B) or 6 hours (Supplementary
Fig. S4). We also compared these effects with those of knocking
down the proteasome subunits PSMB3 and PSMB5 (Fig. 2A–C).
Our microarray results for both 24 and 6 hours of estrogen or
combined estrogen and bortezomib treatment show that
proteasome inhibition dramatically decreases estrogeninduced gene expression (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary
Fig. S4). These effects were specific because an overwhelming
majority of estrogen-induced genes (209 of 302) were decreased
in their induction (Fig. 2B). In contrast, although bortezomib
also had a significant effect on the expression of non–estrogenregulated or estrogen-repressed genes, these conditions
showed a similar number of genes whose expression was
decreased or increased by proteasome inhibition. The effects
of bortezomib on estrogen-induced gene transcription are
specifically due to proteasome inhibition because siRNAmediated knockdown of PSMB3 or PSMB5 resulted in similar
effects on estrogen-induced gene expression (Fig. 2A and B)
with a significant overlap in the changes observed (Fig. 2C).
To verify the results of these microarray studies, we also
conducted qRT-PCR studies on several representative genes
following 2, 6, or 24 hours of estrogen, bortezomib, or combined
treatments. As shown in Figure 2D, the estrogen-induced
expression of all genes tested (CXCL12, GREB1, TFF1, PGR,
PKIB, and WISP2) was dramatically decreased by bortezomib
treatment at each time point, except for TFF1 which showed
decreased induction at both 2 and 6 hours but an increased
induction at 24 hours (Fig. 2D). The effects observed on the
TFF1 gene at 24 hours seem to be due to indirect effects most
likely caused by changes in the stability or expression of a
gene-specific cofactor. Consistent with the absence of an
effect of bortezomib on the fulvestrant-induced decrease in
ERa protein levels, we observed no effect of bortezomib on
the fulvestrant-induced decreases in ERa-dependent gene
transcription and ERa binding (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Further microarray studies conducted after 6 hours of
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4) showed similar, albeit
weaker, effects of bortezomib treatment on estrogeninduced transcription. Therefore, we conclude that proteasome inhibition most likely decreases ERa-dependent estrogen-induced gene transcription by a direct mechanism in a
manner distinct from that of the antiestrogen fulvestrant.
GR activity is not affected by bortezomib treatment
The laboratory proteasome inhibitor MG132 has significant
effects on GR-dependent gene expression (13). Thus, we also
tested the specificity of proteasome inhibition toward ERadependent gene transcription by treating the glucocorticoid-

www.aacrjournals.org

responsive A549 lung cancer cell line with bortezomib and
dexamethasone. In contrast to the effects observed with ERa,
we observed no effects of bortezomib treatment on the rapid
induction of the 4 glucocorticoid-responsive genes investigated (FKBP5, GILZ, SGK1, and SLC19A2; Fig. 3A). Furthermore, no effect of bortezomib on GR binding to these genes
was observed (Fig. 3B).
Bortezomib treatment does not affect ERa binding or
cofactor recruitment to estrogen-induced genes
On the basis of the results of a previous study investigating
the effects of MG132 on the TFF1 gene (10), we utilized ChIP
analyses to test whether proteasome inhibition by bortezomib
affects ERa binding to endogenous estrogen-induced genes
and the subsequent assembly of factors involved in transcriptional activation. However, no significant decrease in ERa
binding to any of the 10 investigated binding sites was
observed (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Figs. S5 and 6A). Given
the importance of the p160 family of nuclear receptor coactivators in controlling estrogen-induced gene transcription and
cellular proliferation (28), we also investigated whether the
binding of GRIP1 (also called SRC2 and TIF2) was affected by
bortezomib treatment. Like ERa, GRIP1 showed an increased
recruitment to several ERa binding sites following estrogen
treatment, and this recruitment was unaffected by bortezomib
treatment (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S6B).
The induction of long-range chromosomal interactions
does not require proteasome activity
Unbiased chromosome- and genome-wide studies showed
that a large fraction of ERa binding sites are greater than 10 kb
away from the genes that they regulate (29). Consistently, ERa
frequently colocalizes with the cohesin component STAG1
(30) and thereby induces dramatic changes in higher order
chromatin structure by inducing long-range chromosomal
interactions between different ERa binding sites (25). Components of the mediator complex, which has been shown to
play an essential role in regulating ERa function (31), also
colocalize and cooperate with cohesin to regulate tissuespecific gene expression (32). Therefore, we also examined
the recruitment of MED12 (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Fig. S6C)
and STAG1 (Fig. 4D, Supplementary Fig. S6D) to ERa-binding
sites which nucleate long-range chromosomal interactions
(25) and were previously shown to colocalize with cohesin
(30). These studies revealed that neither MED12 nor STAG1
recruitment was affected by bortezomib treatment. Consistent with the preserved recruitment of both MED12 and
cohesin to ERa binding sites, we also observed no effect of
bortezomib treatment on estrogen-induced changes in longrange chromosomal interactions as assessed by 3C analyses
on the CXCL12, GREB1, and TFF1 genes (Fig. 4E; Supplementary Figs. S6E and F and S7).
Proteasome inhibition does not affect transcriptional
initiation steps but decreases efficient transcriptional
elongation
On the basis of the normal recruitment of ERa, transcriptional coactivators, and the induction of long-range chromo-

somal interactions, we next tested which subsequent transcriptional step may be affected by proteasome inhibition. Given the
significant role of histone H3 acetylation (H3Ac) during transcriptional initiation, we investigated whether estrogeninduced changes in this epigenetic mark near the transcriptional start site (TSS) of ERa target genes may be affected by
bortezomib treatment. However, no effect of bortezomib on
H3Ac was observed on any of the investigated genes (Fig. 4F;
Supplementary Fig. S8A). Despite the significant decrease
observed in their mRNA levels (Fig. S2D), the recruitment of
RNAPII to the TSS was also unaffected on both the CXCL12 and
GREB1 genes and only mildly affected on the TFF1 gene (Fig. 4G;
Supplementary Fig. S8B). These results are supported by a
previous study which concluded that many ERa target genes
are regulated primarily at the level of transcriptional elongation
(33). Therefore, we concluded that a posttranscriptional initiation step such as transcriptional elongation likely leads to the
decrease in mRNA expression observed on most ERa target
genes following bortezomib treatment.
Phosphorylation of RNAPII at serine 2 of its CTD by cyclindependent kinase-9 (CDK9) plays a critical role during transcriptional elongation by serving as a scaffold to promote the
binding of transcriptional regulatory and chromatin-modifying proteins (34). Therefore, we investigated the effects of
bortezomib treatment on CDK9 recruitment to the TSS of
CXCL12, GREB1, and TFF1 following estrogen, bortezomib, or
combined treatments in MCF7 cells. As shown in Figure 4H
and Supplementary Figure S8C, bortezomib had little or no
effect on CDK9 recruitment in the presence of estrogen. Thus,
we next tested whether the ability of RNAPII to traverse ERa
target genes was affected by proteasome inhibition. Indeed, as
shown in Figure 4I and Supplementary Figure S8D, we
observed a decrease in the elongating (Ser2 phosphorylated)
form of RNAPII at the 30 end of the investigated estrogenregulated genes, whereas the total levels of Ser2 phosphorylation were unchanged (see Fig. 1A).
Proteasome inhibition decreases H2B
monoubiquitination and affects histone exchange
On the basis of the normal recruitment of CDK9 but
decreased ability of RNAPII to transcribe the entire length
of the investigated ERa target genes, we hypothesized that
bortezomib-induced changes in chromatin structure may
prevent transcriptional elongation. One histone modification
which is associated with the transcribed regions of active
genes (35) is dependent upon Ser2 phosphorylation of the

RNAPII CTD (20) and has been implicated in transcriptional
elongation is histone H2Bub1 (36). Furthermore, proteasome
inhibition causes a rapid decrease in H2Bub1 within minutes
of treatment (35, 37). In contrast to the stabilizing effect of
proteasome inhibition on many ubiquitinated proteins, the
effect on H2Bub1 is related to the transient nature of
H2Bub1 and is a consequence of a rapid depletion of the
pool of free ubiquitin in the nucleus (37, 38). Consistent with
the previously published results for other proteasome inhibitors (35, 37), we observed a significant decrease in H2Bub1
following bortezomib treatment (Fig. 5A). These effects were
specific for H2Bub1 because other histone modifications
associated with active genes and mark transcriptional initiation (H3 lysine 9/14 acetylation; H3Ac) and elongation (H3
lysine 36 trimethylation; H3K36me3) were unaffected by
bortezomib treatment.
H2Bub1 functions during transcriptional elongation by
cooperating with the facilitates chromatin transcription
(FACT) histone chaperone complex to increase histone
exchange and open chromatin structure to allow passage of
RNAPII through chromatin during transcription (36). Importantly, H2Bub1 is localized exclusively in a chromatin-associated form (39) and seems to be a prerequisite for both
transcription-associated (36) and DNA repair–associated histone exchange (39). Therefore, we tested whether the bortezomib-induced decrease in H2Bub1 levels also leads to
decreased recruitment of the FACT complex to chromatin
by separating the nucleoplasmic and chromatin-bound fractions from MCF7 cells treated with estrogen, bortezomib, or
combined treatments. Indeed, as shown in Figure 5B and
consistent with the global decrease in H2Bub1 levels, the
recruitment of the FACT component SSRP1 to chromatin
was significantly impaired by bortezomib treatment.
The positive effect of histone chaperones such as FACT
during transcriptional elongation and other DNA-associated
processes is achieved by the removal and reinsertion of
components of the core nucleosome. This effect can be
observed by analyzing the soluble fraction (i.e., "non-chromatin bound fraction") of core histones such as H3. A recent
report showed that H2Bub1 is essential for DNA damage–
induced changes in the pool of free H3 (39). Consistently, we
also observed that the bortezomib-induced loss of total
(Fig. 5A) and chromatin-bound H2Bub1 (Fig. 5B) resulted
in decreased nucleoplasmic H3 (Fig. 5B). Thus, bortezomib
seems to decrease histone exchange by blocking H2B monoubiquitination.

Bortezomib Reduces ERa Activity by Decreasing H2Bub1

H2Bub1 mediated by knockdown of RNF40 might affect
estrogen-dependent cellular proliferation. Interestingly,
RNF40 knockdown led to estrogen-independent proliferation
of MCF7 cells (Fig. 5E and F). This effect was not further
potentiated by estrogen treatment. In contrast, control transfected cells depended upon estrogen treatment of proliferation (Fig. 5E, top).
ERa-independent proliferation is frequently associated
with increased activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathways (42). To determine whether a loss of RNF40
expression also leads to the activation of estrogenindependent cell proliferation signaling, we examined the
activation of both AKT and ERK. Interestingly, RNF40 knockdown was sufficient to significantly activate both signaling
pathways (Fig. 5F).
H2Bub1 decreases during tumor progression
Although our previous study indicated a potential tumor
suppressor role for RNF20 (41), no study to date has investigated the presence of H2Bub1 in normal and cancerous
tissues. Therefore, we developed a new H2Bub1-specific monoclonal antibody using a previously published branched-peptide
antigen strategy (35) and carried out immunohistochemical
analyses of tissue microarrays containing normal mammary
epithelial tissue as well as benign, malignant, and metastatic
breast cancer samples. These studies yielded a total of 109
interpretable results in which the nuclei of both normal
mammary ductal epithelial cells (Fig. 6A) and all 18 benign
tumor samples stained positive for H2Bub1 (Fig. 6B and C).
In contrast, only 21 of 64 malignant breast cancer samples
(32%) stained positive for H2Bub1 and only 3 of the 19
metastatic tumor samples stained positive for H2Bub1
(Fig. 6B and C; Table 1). As a control, we also stained normal
and tumor samples for (total) H2B (Supplementary Fig. S10).
As expected, all samples stained positive for H2B, confirming
that the decreased H2Bub1 staining during breast cancer
progression is due to decreased monoubiquitination of H2B
and not a loss of nuclear histones. Thus, decreased H2B
monoubiquitination correlates with breast cancer progression and metastasis in a small cohort of tumor samples.
Furthermore, on the basis of these results and the importance of cell migration for metastasis, we also investigated
the effects of RNF40 knockdown on the migratory potential
of a normal mammary epithelial cell line. Consistent with a
central role for H2Bub1 in suppressing metastasis, increased
AKT and ERK activity following RNF40 knockdown, and with
our previous study with RNF20 (41), siRNA-mediated knockdown of RNF40 resulted in increased migration of MCF10A
cells (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Inhibition of proteasome activity has been shown to be
effective in treating some types of cancers including multiple
myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. However, its effectiveness in the treatment of breast cancer is not clear. Moreover,

www.aacrjournals.org

its utility for different stages and subtypes of breast cancer
needs to be determined. On the basis of the proposed necessity of proteasome activity for ERa-induced gene transcription
(9, 10), we sought to determine the effects of the clinical
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib on estrogen-regulated gene
transcription and investigated its mechanism of action. We
provide the first evidence that bortezomib-mediated proteasome inhibition functions to limit transcriptional elongation
of estrogen-induced genes by causing a global decrease in
H2Bub1 levels. This in turn prevents histone chaperone
recruitment to chromatin and increased nucleosome
dynamics on ERa target genes.
This "nonproteolytic" effect of proteasome inhibition challenges the general assumption that proteasome inhibition
functions primarily by preventing the degradation of specific
proteins required for essential cellular processes (43, 44).
Although these mechanisms likely influence the ultimate
inhibition of cell-cycle progression and the induction of
apoptosis after prolonged bortezomib treatment in MCF7
cells, they do not seem to be responsible for the rapid effects
on estrogen-induced gene transcription that we have
observed.
A recent study reported a combinatorial effect of fulvestrant
and bortezomib on the induction of apoptosis and laid the
ground work for ongoing clinical trials combining these 2
treatments (16). In this study, we were unable to see any
effects of bortezomib treatment on the rapid fulvestrantinduced ERa downregulation and the repression of ERa target
gene transcription or ERa binding. Thus, as suggested by the
reported induction of an unfolded protein response, the longterm effects of combined bortezomib and fulvestrant treatment are probably not due to changes in ERa-dependent gene
transcription but rather a secondary effect induced by the
accumulation of a highly polyubiquitinated protein. However,
additional experiments are clearly needed to address whether
and how these 2 therapies work synergistically, their mechanism of action, and the contribution of altering ERa transcriptional activity in eliciting their effects.
According to our data, we propose a new mechanism
whereby bortezomib treatment decreases the ability of ERa
to activate estrogen-responsive genes by leading to a rapid and
global loss of H2Bub1. This effect is due to a rapid depletion of
free ubiquitin in the nucleus (37, 38). On the basis of the very
dynamic nature of H2B monoubiquitination (20), the depletion of nuclear ubiquitin prevents new ubiquitination of H2B
and causes a rapid loss of H2Bub1 levels. This is in stark
contrast to most previously proposed models which invoked
the degradation of specific transcriptional complexes as being
essential for ERa activity. Although a stabilization of some
gene-specific coactivator proteins following bortezomib treatment likely influences the regulation of some estrogen-responsive genes at later time points (e.g., TFF1), our data suggest
that H2Bub1-dependent recruitment of the FACT histone
chaperone complex and the subsequent changes in nucleosome dynamics which allow passage of transcribing RNAPII
through ERa target genes is a likely mechanism whereby
bortezomib very rapidly decreases the majority of estrogeninduced gene transcription.

Consistent with the data presented here on estrogen-regulated genes, we and others have shown that H2Bub1 is
probably most important for signal-specific induction of gene
expression (36, 41). These effects are likely to be due to the
need for major changes in chromatin structure caused by
disruption of the 30-nm chromatin fiber by monoubiquitination of H2B (45). Genes which are already active or repressed
may not require the presence or absence of H2Bub1 to remain
in these states. In contrast, the activation of silent or lowly
expressed genes which lie within a specific chromatin context
is more likely to require the addition or loss of H2Bub1
because the activation of these genes will require dynamic
alterations in the structure of the surrounding chromatin.
Interestingly, these effects seem to be signal specific because
the activation of gene transcription by GR did not require
RNF40 expression.
A particularly striking and potentially therapy-relevant
finding of this study is the correlation of a loss of H2Bub1
with tumor progression and the effects of RNF40 knockdown on both cellular proliferation and migration. Despite
a significant decrease in the induction of estrogenregulated gene transcription, we observed no significant
effect of RNF40 knockdown on cellular proliferation in
the presence of estrogen. Instead, RNF40 knockdown
allowed for estrogen-independent proliferation of MCF7
cells. These paradoxical findings were initially very surprising. However, our findings that the AKT and ERK cell
survival and proliferative signaling pathways are activated
suggest that the effects of RNF40 knockdown may extend
beyond its effects on chromatin structure. Consistent with
this hypothesis, the obligate heterodimeric partner of
RNF40, RNF20, has been shown to interact with both isoforms of EBP1 (46) which has been implicated in directly
controlling the activity of nuclear AKT (47) and the EGF
receptor (48). Although, it is likely that the increased
activation of the ERK and AKT pathways may be related
to this interaction, it is presently unknown how or if RNF40
affects the activity of EBP1. Thus, a loss of RNF40 or RNF20
activity during tumor progression may be an important
step in the development of hormone-independent breast
cancer by simultaneously decreasing ERa-dependent cell
differentiation and activating cell survival and proliferative
signaling.

www.aacrjournals.org

We hypothesize that the loss of H2Bub1 during tumor
progression and metastasis may lead to decreased cellular
differentiation and reversion to a stem cell–like phenotype. In
support of this, the mRNA levels of the H2B deubiquitinating
enzyme USP22 correlate with an undifferentiated stem-like
phenotype in multiple types of cancer (49), and its protein
expression was shown to correlate with breast cancer progression and patient outcome (50). Thus, multiple mechanisms which diminish H2B monoubiquitination such as
decreased RNF20 or RNF40 expression or increased USP22
expression may similarly lead to a loss of H2Bub1 and reversion to a stem cell–like phenotype.
In this study, we have uncovered a novel mechanism
whereby proteasome inhibition blocks ERa-activated gene
expression by interfering with histone H2B monoubiquitination and histone exchange. Moreover, we provide the first
evidence that H2Bub1 decreases during tumorigenesis. Additional studies into the various mechanisms of proteasome
inhibitor action need to be conducted to determine which
tumors may respond best to bortezomib treatment. For
example, more differentiated ERa/H2Bub1-positive tumors
might be predicted to respond to H2Bub1-reducing therapies
such as bortezomib which simultaneously decrease ERadependent gene transcription and induce apoptosis. In contrast, more advanced, less differentiated, ERa/H2Bub1-negative tumors may benefit from therapies which increase
H2Bub1 levels and lead to a more differentiated phenotype.
To address these aspects, additional immunohistochemical
studies investigating the presence of H2Bub1 in a larger cohort
of patients with more extensive immunohistologic characterization, patient follow-up information and hormone responsiveness as well as in vivo animal model studies should be
conducted. We hypothesize that H2Bub1 may represent an
important new diagnostic marker and potential therapeutic
target in breast cancer.
