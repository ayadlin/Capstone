ABSTRACT
The Hippo signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating tissue homeostasis,
organ size, tumorigenesis and cancer chemoresistance when deregulated.
Physiologically, the Hippo core kinase cassette that consists of mamma-lian STE20-like
protein kinase 1/2 (MST1/2), and large tumour suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2), together
with the adaptor proteins Salvador homologue 1 (SAV1) and MOB kinase activator 1
(MOB1), tightly restricts the activities of homologous oncoproteins Yes-associated
protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) to low
levels. However, how the Hippo kinase cassette core components are simultaneously
inhibited, to exhibit constitutively inactivated Hippo signaling and activated YAP/TAZ in
cancer remains puzzling. Herein, we reported that miR-181c directly repressed MST1,
LATS2, MOB1 and SAV1 expression in human pancreatic cancer cells. Overexpression
of miR-181c induced hyperactivation of the YAP/TAZ and enhanced expression of the
Hippo signaling downstream genes CTGF, BIRC5 and BLC2L1, leading to pancreatic
cancer cell survival and chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, high miR181c levels were significantly correlated with Hippo signaling inactivation in pancreatic
cancer samples, and predicted a poor patient overall survival. These findings provide
a novel mechanism for Hippo signaling inactivation in cancer, indicating not only a
potentially pivotal role for miR-181c in the progression of pancreatic cancer, but also
may represent a new therapeutic target and prognostic marker.

been only about six months, mostly because of an almost
complete resistance against chemotherapies [3, 4]. Hence,
it would be of great clinical value to further understand
the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer
chemoresistance and to identify effective early markers for
the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease as well as novel
therapeutic targets.
The Hippo signaling pathway is dysregulated in
various human cancers and plays important roles in
tumorigenesis as well as many other important biological
processes [5–7]. Recently, accumulating evidence
strongly suggested that the Hippo pathway may play
important roles in chemotherapeutic drug resistance
as well [8]. YAP and TAZ are the two major effectors

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal
gastrointestinal tract malignancies and the seventh most
common cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. The
overall prognosis for patients diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer remains dismal, with 5-year survival rates averaging
<5% [1]. This tumor is usually presented at advanced
stage, when the surgical therapy is limited. Indeed, only
15–20% of patients are operable; for the majority of cases,
the only therapeutic promise is cytostatic treatment [2].
Despite chemotherapy involving multiple drugs, including
gemcitabine, the median survival time of patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer over the past decades has

a novel regulatory mechanism for Hippo signaling
inactivation, and might also provide a potential therapeutic
target for pancreatic cancer.

and inhibited by Hippo pathway [9, 10]. Studies have
consistently demonstrated that upregulation of YAP
or TAZ rendered resistance of mammary and ovarian
cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs taxol and cisplatin
[11–15]. Moreover, hepatocellular carcinoma cells
with high levels of YAP expression were doxorubicinresistant, and hyper-activation of YAP was observed in
5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant colon cancer cells and
castration-resistant prostate tumor samples [16–18].
Additionally, downregulation of the Hippo pathway
components mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1/2
(MST1/2) and large tumour suppressor1/2 (LATS1/2)
were observed in cancers, contributing to their resistance
to diverse chemotherapeutic drugs [19–24]. Importantly,
TAZ downregulation or MST1 upregulation were found
to sensitize breast cancer and prostate cancer cells to
taxol and cisplatin [15, 21]. Accordingly, the Hippo
pathway is considered as an important regulator in
cancer chemoresistance, and better understanding of the
mechanisms that regulate Hippo pathway may provide
new clues for more effective cancer therapy.
In the mammalian Hippo pathway, there are four
core kinase cassette components: kinases MST1/2 and
LATS1/2, as well as the adaptor proteins SAV1 and
MOB1 [7]. Physiologically, the Hippo kinase cassette
tightly balances YAP and TAZ activities, both spatially
and temporally, to low levels through phosphorylation–
ubiquitination mechanisms. When Hippo signaling
is active, YAP and TAZ are phosphorylated by core
complexes, then restricted to the cytoplasm and degraded
[10, 25, 26]. Conversely, when Hippo signaling is
absent, unphosphorylated YAP1/TAZ enter the nucleus
and induce the transcriptional activity of TEA domain
(TEAD) family members (TEAD1–TEAD4), by acting
as the transcriptional co-activators [27–29]. In turn, the
activated TEADs transcriptionally upregulate multiple
downstream effectors to exert a pleiotropic role in tumor
progression, including connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF), baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5) and
BCL2-like 1 (BCL2L1), leading to the promotion of cell
survival and chemoresistance [15, 30–32]. However, how
MST1/2, LATS1/2, SAV1, and MOB1 are simultaneously
repressed to exhibit constitutively activated YAP/TAZ in
cancer remains unclear.
It has been well-established that microRNAs
(miRNAs) are able to simultaneously repress a
variety of target genes by binding to their mRNA 3′
untranslated regions (3′UTRs), and play important roles
in tumorigenesis and malignant progression of human
cancers [33, 34]. Herein, public microarray data and our
results together suggested that miR-181c was substantially
overexpressed in clinical pancreatic cancer samples and
significantly correlated with poor prognosis. miR-181c
directly repressed MST1, LATS2, MOB1 and SAV1,
leading to YAP/TAZ activation and subsequent promotion
of pancreatic cancer cell survival and chemoresistance

RESULTS
Upregulation of miR-181c correlates with
pancreatic cancer progression
Analysis using a published microarray (NCBI/GEO/
GSE24279; n = 185, including 22 normal, 27 pancreatitis
and 136 pancreatic cancer samples), we found that
miR-181c levels remained low in normal pancreatic
tissues but became markedly higher in patients with
pancreatitis and further elevated in pancreatic cancer
patients (Figure  1A). We further confirmed miR-181c
expression in pancreatic cancer tissues using real-time
PCR. As shown in Figure 1B, miR-181c expression was
markedly increased in 124 pancreatic cancer samples
compared with that in 10 non-cancerous pancreatic tissues.
In the pancreatic cancer samples, statistical analysis
revealed that increased miR-181c expression strongly
correlated with TNM stage and histological differentiation
(all P < 0.05) (Supplementary Table 1 and 2). Importantly,
patients with high miR-181c expression had a significantly
poorer overall survival compared to patients with low
miR-181c expression (P = 0.001; hazard ratio = 2.03, 95%
CI = 1.33–3.11; Figure 1C). Thus, these results suggest
that upregulation of miR-181c might be involved in
human pancreatic cancer progression.

MiR-181c directly targets the core components
of the Hippo signaling pathway
Recent studies indicated that the Hippo signaling
is deregulated and plays an important role in the
development and progression of pancreatic cancer [35–37].
Interestingly, using the publicly available algorithms
TargetScan and miRanda, we found that the core
components of the Hippo signaling pathway, i.e., MST1,
LATS2, MOB1 and SAV1 might be potential targets of
miR-181c (Figure 2A). We exogenously overexpressed
miR-181c via miR-181c mimic transfection, and
endogeneously silencing miR-181c by transfecting
antagomiR-181c (Supplementary Figure 1). Western
blotting analysis revealed that miR-181c overexpression
significantly suppressed expression levels of MST1,
LATS2, MOB1 and SAV1, and phosphorylation levels
of downstream effectors YAP (p-YAPser127) and TAZ
(p-TAZser89). In contrast, miR-181c inhibition increased
them, suggesting that miR-181c negatively regulated these
proteins (Figure 2B). Furthermore, luciferase assay showed
that miR-181c overexpression attenuated, while inhibition
of miR-181c elevated the reporter activities driven by the
3′UTRs of these transcripts (Figure 2C). However, ectopic

expression of the miR-181c did not exhibit repressive
effects on the reporter activities driven by the mutant
3′UTRs of these transcripts within miR-181c–binding
seed regions (Supplementary Figure  2A). Moreover,
microribonucleoprotein (miRNP) immunoprecipitation
(IP) assay revealed a selective association of miR-181c
with MST1, LATS2, MOB1 and SAV1, but not with YAP,
TAZ or GAPDH (Figure 2D), further indicating the
specific effects of miR-181c on these targets. In addition,
individual overexpression of these targets potently
inhibited the TEAD activity in miR-181c-overexpressing
cells (Supplementary Figure  2B), demonstrating that
MST1, LATS2, MOB1 and SAV1 were functional effectors
of miR-181c on regulating TEAD activation. Collectively,
our results suggest that miR-181c directly targets MST1,
LATS2, MOB1 and SAV1.

of miR-181c increased, while silencing miR-181c
reduced the binding capability of TEAD1 with CTGF
promoter (Supplementary Figure 3). Moreover, cellular
fractionation and fluorescent immunostaining assays
revealed that overexpression of miR-181c increased
nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ, while silencing
of miR-181c reduced nuclear YAP and TAZ expression
(Figure 3C and 3D). Therefore, our results suggest that
miR-181c inactivates the Hippo signaling pathway.

MiR-181c promotes chemoresistance in
pancreatic cancer in vitro
Since resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs is crucial for the inefficient
therapy, and recent evidence strongly suggests that
Hippo pathway inactivation plays important roles in
chemotherapeutic drug resistance [8, 11–15], we then
investigated the role of miR-181c upregulation in the
drug-resistant survival. Annexin V and TUNEL assays
demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-181c reduced
the apoptosis rate of PANC-1 and BxPC3 pancreatic
cancer cells by resisting to the chemotherapeutic
agent  gemcitabine (Figure 4A and 4B). Meanwhile,
gemcitabine treatment had no effect on miR-181c
expression in pancreatic cancer cells  (Supplementary
Figure 4A). Moreover, the effect of miR-181c on apoptotic
protection was confirmed by  examining the cleavages
of pro-caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) in pancreatic cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4C,
cleavages of both caspase 3 and PARP were suppressed

MiR-181c inactivates the tumor-suppressive
Hippo signaling pathway
The tumor-suppressive Hippo signaling pathway
was identified as a major regulator of cellular apoptosis by
the nuclear translocation of YAP and TAZ and interaction
with TEAD transcription factors. We further examined
the role of miR-181c in Hippo signaling pathway. As
shown in Figure 3A and 3B, we found that miR-181c
overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells significantly
increased, but silencing of miR-181c reduced TEADdependent luciferase activity, and expression levels of
the Hippo downstream genes CTGF, BIRC5 and BCL2L1
in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, overexpression

in the miR-181c-overexpressing cells treated with
gemcitabine. Importantly, the colony formation assay
indicated that overexpression of miR-181c rendered
resistance of pancreatic cancer cells in the presence of
gemcitabine, 5-FU, or paclitaxel to form many more
colonies as compared to the control (Figure 4D and
Supplementary Figure 4B).
Conversely, the role of miR-181c in pancreatic
chemoresistance was further examined by endogenously
silencing miR-181c. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, we
found that silencing of miR-181c increased the apoptosis
rate of PANC-1 and BxPC3 pancreatic cells under the
treatment of gemcitabine. Moreover, we also found that
neither overexpression of miR-181c nor silencing of
miR-181c had an effect on the apoptotic percentage
of PANC-1 and BxPC3 cell lines without chemo-drug
treatment, suggesting that miR-181c exerted its effects
on pancreatic cancer cell survival in the presence
of gemcitabine (Supplementary Figure 4C and 4D).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Consistently, cleavages of both caspase 3 and PARP
were increased in the miR-181c–silenced cells treated
with gemcitabine (Figure 5C). Moreover, gemcitabine,
5-FU, and paclitaxel treatment significantly reduced the
number of colonies formed by the miR-181c–silenced
pancreatic cancer cells. Collectively, these results suggest
that miR-181c promotes pancreatic cancer cell resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro.

cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs in vivo
The promotive effect of miR-181c on pancreatic
cancer cell chemoresistance was further examined in vivo.

or antagomiR-181c (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline
[PBS] at 2 mg/ml) three times per week for four weeks,
combined with intraperitoneal injection of gemcitabine
(50  mg/kg) weekly (Figure 6A and Supplementary
Figure 5). The tumor volumes and weight were increased in
the miR-181c plus gemitabine group, but were decreased in
the antagomiR-181c plus gemcitabine group, as compared
to the controls, respectively (Figure 6A–6C). Significantly,
the combined antagomiR-181c and gemcitabine
treatment markedly restricted the tumor growth to low
volumes (Figure 6C). These results suggested that
miR-181c promoted gemcitabine resistance and tumor
growth, while injection of antagomiR-181c dramatically
sensitized PANC-1 cells to gemcitabine treatment and
inhibited tumor growth. Meanwhile, tumors injected with
miR-181c mimic had decreased TUNEL-positive apoptotic
cells, whereas tumors injected with antagomir-181c had
a higher percentage of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells
(Figure 6D). Taken together, these findings suggest that
miR-181c upregulation promotes pancreatic cancer cell
chemoresistance, and inhibition of miR-181c sensitizes
pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine in vivo.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We then explored the functional significance of
Hippo signaling in the chemoresistance of pancreatic
cancer cells by silencing of the two key kinases MST1
and LATS2. As shown in Figure 7A and Supplementary
Figure 6A, either silencing of MST1 or LATS2 increased
the TEAD activity. MST1 or LATS2 silencing protected the
apotosis induced by gemcitabine, and rendered pancreatic
cancer cells to form more colonies in the presence of
gemcitabine (Figure 7B and 7C). Thus, these results
suggest that inactivation of Hippo signaling plays an
important role in the chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer.
Furthermore, we investigated whether activation
of the downstream effectors YAP/TAZ is essential for
miR-181c-induced chemoresistance. As expected, the
stimulatory effect of miR-181c on TEAD luciferase
activity and expression of CTGF, BIRC5 and BCL2L1
were inhibited by YAP or TAZ silencing (Figure 7D
and Supplementary Figure 6B, 6C). Moreover, YAP
or TAZ silencing abrogated the promotive effects, but

overexpression of YAP or TAZ rescued the repressive
effects of miR-181c on gemcitabine resistance, as indicated
by the TUNEL and colony formation assays (Figure 7E,
7F and Supplementary Figure 6D). Collectively, these
results indicate that activation of YAP/TAZ is critical for
miR-181c–induced chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer
cells.

clinically relevant. As shown in Figure 8, miR-181c levels
in 10 freshly collected pancreatic cancer samples were
significantly positively correlated with mRNA levels of
the Hippo downstream genes CTGF (r = 0.767, P = 0.010)
and BIRC5 (r = 0.795, P = 0.006), as well as nuclear
expression levels of YAP (r = 0.762, P = 0.010) and
TAZ (r = 0.661, P = 0.038). Consistently, IHC staining
results revealed that YAP/TAZ was strongly expressed
in pancreatic cancer cells but not in the surrounding
stromal cells, and nuclear YAP/TAZ expression correlated
with miR-181c expression (Supplementary Figure 7).
Collectively, these results further support the notion that
upregulation of miR-181c inactivates the Hippo signaling,
and results in poor clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer.

DISCUSSION

indicated that YAP and TAZ are constitutively activated
in a wide range of tumor types and are involved in tumor
progression by promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation,
resistance to apoptosis and even distant metastasis [7, 38].
However, how cancer cells override the negative regulation
induced by MST1, LATS2, MOB1, and SAV1 to exhibit
constitutively inactivated Hippo signaling and activated
YAP/TAZ remains puzzling. Herein, we demonstrated that
miR-181c was substantially overexpressed in pancreatic
cancer and induced hyper-activation of YAP/TAZ via
directly targeting MST1, LATS2, SAV1 and MOB1.
Therefore, our findings represent a novel mechanism that
simultaneously disrupts the negative regulation by the

The YAP and TAZ transcriptional co-factors are
two key downstream effectors of the Hippo signaling
pathway, and exert pleiotropic roles in both physiological
and pathological processes, such as organ size control,
tissue regeneration, differentiation, stem cell renewal,
and tumorigenesis [6, 9, 10]. Under physiological
conditions, YAP and TAZ are largely restricted to a low
level of activities by the Hippo kinase cascade consisting
of MST1, LATS2, MOB1 and SAV1, which sequentially
phosphorylate YAP/TAZ to restrict in cytoplasm and
degradate [10, 25, 26]. In contrast, mounting evidence has

core kinase cassette, leading to constitutive YAP/TAZ
activation in cancer cells.
The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is rather poor,
partly because it is frequently diagnosed at an advanced
stage precluding surgical resection, and partly because it
is characterized by a chemoresistant phenotype. Acting
as a nucleoside analog drug, gemcitabine is now one of
the first-line chemotherapeutic drugs in pancreatic cancer
by inducing faults and damage in DNA replication.
However, gemcitabine-resistance was observed in part of
the pancreatic cancer patients, suggesting that there might
be some other mechanisms responsible for the survival of
pancreatic cancer cells. Although different mechanisms,
including ineffective metabolic drug conversion, abnormal
membrane receptor transport, increased DNA repair,
and apoptotic pathway alteration have been identified,
the molecular mechanism of pancreatic cancer cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemoresistance remains poorly understood. Recent
evidence indicated that Hippo signaling inactivation
and YAP/TAZ hyperactivation played important roles in
chemotherapeutic drug resistance, rendering different
cancers insensitive to drug-induced apoptosis, suggesting
that Hippo signaling might be a novel target for cancer
chemotherapy [8, 11–15]. Our results revealed that
miR-181c upregulation promoted pancreatic cancer cell
chemoresistance by inactivating Hippo signaling and
subsequently activating YAP/TAZ. In contrast, silencing
of miR-181c upregulated MST1, LATS2, SAV1 and
MOB1, and reconstituted the Hippo signaling, leading
to increased sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis. More
importantly, the delivery of antagomiR-181c dramatically
sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment
in vivo, suggesting an effective role of antagomiR-181c in
pancreatic cancer chemotherapy. Taken together, our results

not only suggest miR-181c–induced Hippo signaling
inactivation as a novel mechanism for pancreatic cancer
chemoresistance; but also propose that miR-181c might be
a potential therapeutic target for human pancreatic cancer.
Recent evidence has revealed that Hippo signaling
pathway inactivation plays an important role in the
development of human cancers [7]. In fact, many of
the genes involved in the Hippo signaling pathway
are recognized as tumor suppressors, while YAP/TAZ
is identified as an oncogene. Transgenic mice with
liver-specific YAP overexpression exhibit dramatically
increased liver size and eventually develop tumors,
while LATS1 knockout leads to soft tissue sarcoma
and ovarian tumor development [39–41]. Consistently,
amplification of YAP or loss-of-function mutation of
Hippo pathway components such as MOB1 and SAV1
have been identified in a series of human cancers [14, 42,
43]. Notably, upregulated YAP expression is also found
in human pancreatic cancer, and ectopic YAP expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transforms non-tumorigenic human pancreatic epithelial
cells and drives recurrence and progression of pancreatic
cancer, suggesting that Hippo signaling might be involved
in pancreatic cancer development [36, 37]. Interestingly,
using published microarray–based high-throughput
assessment, we found that miR-181c expression was
markedly higher in patients with pancreatitis, which
was an early event of pancreatic cancer development.
Moreover, miR-181c inactivated the Hippo signaling
and induced YAP activation. Thus, our findings suggest
that miR-181c might be involved in the development of
pancreatic cancer by inactivating the Hippo signaling.
However, the biological role of miR-181c in pancreatitis
and its relationship with pancreatic cancer development in
cirrhotic tissues require further investigation.
MiR-181c has been found to be upregulated in
multiple human cancers, and upregulation of miR-181c
contributes to cancer cell proliferation, migration and
invasion via different mechanisms [44–47]. However,

the expression of miR-181c has also been shown to be
downregualted in glioblastoma multiforme, and predicted
a poor patient survival [48]. These findings indicate that
miR-181c functions as both an oncomir and tumorsuppressive miRNA, depending on the tumor type.
To investigate the clinical significance and the precise
mechanism of action of miR-181c in pancreatic cancer
pathogenesis, we examined miR-181c expression in
pancreatic cancer samples and found that miR-181c was
markedly upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues as
compared to normal tissues. Upregulation of miR-181c
significantly correlated with the clinicopathological
features and poorer overall survival of pancreatic cancer
patients, suggesting that miR-181c might be associated
with the progression of pancreatic cancer. Consistently,
miR-181c dramatically promoted pancreatic cancer cell
chemoresistance by inactivating the Hippo signaling
pathway, further demonstrating the tumor-promoting role
of miR-181c in pancreatic cancer. Of note, by analysis
of the promoter region of miR-181c using the CONSITE
program, we found two typical response elements of the
transcriptional factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which
is hyperactivated in pancreatic cancer [49]. Meanwhile,
the miR-181c locus is located in a region within 19p13
reported to be amplified in different human cancers
[47, 50], suggesting that miR-181c overexpression in
pancreatic cancer might be associated with genomic
amplification. Thus, it would be of great interest to
further investigate whether upregulation of miR-181c in
pancreatic is attributed to genomic amplification and/or
NF-κB-mediated transcriptional upregulation.

In summary, our study has revealed that miR-181c
upregulation plays an important role in pancreatic cancer
progression and miR-181c is a critical repressor of Hippo
signaling by targeting the core kinase cassette, i.e., MST1,
LATS2, SAV1 and MOB1. Understanding the precise
role of miR-181c in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and
in the Hippo signaling pathway promises to increase our
knowledge of the biological basis of cancer development
and may also facilitate the development of new therapeutic
strategies against pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
The pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and
BXPC3 were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS
(HyClone, Logan, UT, USA).

Patient information and tissue specimens
The 124 paraffin-embedded, archived pancreatic
cancer samples used in this study were histopathologically
and clinically diagnosed at the Hubei Cancer Hospital
between 2008 and 2011. Clinical staging and
clinicopathological TNM classification were determined
according to the criteria proposed by International Union
Against Cancer (UICC) criteria. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients prior to the study. The
Institutional Research Ethics Committee approved the

use of the clinical specimens for research purposes. The
clinicopathological characteristics of the samples are
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Freshly collected
pancreatic cancer tissue specimens were each collected
from 10 patients, and were frozen and stored in liquid
nitrogen until used.

Apoptotic DNA fragmentation was examined
using an in situ DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL
System assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were plated in
24-well flat-bottom plates and treated with gemcitabine
(5 μM) for 36 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
at 4°C for 30 min, permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100,
and labelled with fluorescein-12-dUTP using terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The localised green
fluorescence of apoptotic cells from the fluorescein-12dUTP was detected by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert
100M, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Plasmid, oligonucleotides, and transfection
The TEAD Luciferase Reporting system was
purchased from lifeome (Oceanside, CA, USA). The
3′UTR regions of human MST1, LATS2, MOB1 and
SAV1, generated by PCR amplification from PANC-1
pancreatic cancer cell line, were cloned into the pGL3
luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI).
We purchased miR-181c mimic, miR-181c antagonist
(antagomiR-129-5p), and controls from RiboBio
(Guangzhou, China). Transfection of the plasmids,
siRNAs, miR-181c mimic, and antagomiR-181c were
performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Xenografted tumor model and staining
BALB/c-nu mice (5–6 weeks old, 18–20 g) were
purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the
Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine and housed
in barrier facilities on a 12-h light/dark cycle. The
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yatsen University approved all experimental procedures. The
mice were randomly assigned to groups (n = 8/group).
The mice in groups were inoculated subcutaneously
with PANC-1 cells (5 × 106) in the left dorsal flank, and
two weeks later, injected intratumorally with 100 μL
miR-181c mimic, mimic control, antagomiR-181c control
or antagomiR control (diluted in PBS at 2 mg/mL)
three times per week for 4 weeks, combining with
intraperitoneal injection of gemcitabine (50 mg/kg)
weekly. Tumors were examined every 4 days; length,
width, and thickness were measured with callipers, and
tumor volumes were calculated. Tumor volume was
calculated using the equation (L × W2)/2. On day 42,
tumors were detected by an IVIS imagining system
(Caliper), then animals were euthanized, tumors were
excised, weighed and paraffin-embedded. Apoptotic index
was measured by percentage of TUNEL-positive cells.

Western blotting analysis
Cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and heated
for 5 min at 100°C. Equal quantities of denatured protein
samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels,
and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). After blocking with 5% non-fat
dry milk in TBS/0.05% Tween 20, membranes were
incubated with a specific primary antibody, followed by
a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody.
Proteins were visualised using ECL reagents (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). Antibodies against MST1, LATS2,
MOB1, SAV1, YAP, TAZ and p84 were purchased from
Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). The membranes were
stripped and reprobed with an anti–α-tubulin antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as the loading
control.

MiRNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR

Luciferase assay

Total miRNA from cultured cells and fresh surgical
pancreatic tissues was extracted using a mirVana miRNA
Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. We synthesised cDNA
from 10 ng total RNA using a TaqMan miRNA reverse
transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA), and quantified the expression levels of miR-181c
using a miRNA-specific TaqMan MiRNA Assay Kit
(Applied Biosystems). The expression of miRNA was
defined based on the Ct, and relative expression levels
were calculated as 2-[(Ct of miR-181c) – (Ct of U6)] after normalisation
with reference to expression of U6 small nuclear RNA.

Cells (4 × 104) were seeded in triplicate in
24-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Cells were transfected
with 100 ng TEAD reporter luciferase plasmid [27],
or pGL3-MST1-3′UTR, or pGL3-LATS2-3′UTR, or
pGL3-MOB1-3′UTR, or pGL3-SAV1-3′UTR luciferase
plasmid, plus 5 ng pRL-TK Renilla plasmid (Promega)
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. Luciferase and Renilla
signals were measured 36 h after transfection using a Dual
Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
