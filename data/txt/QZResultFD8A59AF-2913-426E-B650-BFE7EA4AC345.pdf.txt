BACKGROUND: Rates of nonadherence to aromatase inhibitors (AIs) among Medicare beneficiaries with hormone receptor-positive
early breast cancer are high. Out-of-pocket drug costs appear to be an important contributor to this and may be addressed by eliminating copayments and other forms of patient cost sharing. The authors estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing
Medicare beneficiaries with full prescription coverage for AIs compared with usual prescription coverage under the Medicare Part D
program. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to simulate AI use and disease progression in a hypothetical
cohort of postmenopausal Medicare beneficiaries with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. The analysis was conducted
from the societal perspective and considered a lifetime horizon. The main outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which
was measured as the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: For patients receiving usual prescription coverage,
average quality-adjusted survival was 11.35 QALYs, and lifetime costs were $83,002. For patients receiving full prescription coverage,
average quality-adjusted survival was 11.38 QALYs, and lifetime costs were $82,728. Compared with usual prescription coverage, full
prescription coverage would result in greater quality-adjusted survival (0.03 QALYs) and less resource use ($275) per beneficiary.
From the perspective of Medicare, full prescription coverage was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $15,128 per
QALY gained) but not cost saving. CONCLUSIONS: Providing full prescription coverage for AIs to Medicare beneficiaries with
hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer would both improve health outcomes and save money from the societal perspective.

INTRODUCTION
Clinical practice guidelines recommend a 5-year course of aromatase inhibitors (AIs), administered as initial monotherapy
or after tamoxifen, for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer.1,2 Despite their proven benefits over tamoxifen,3 adherence to AIs remains suboptimal, and only a half of all patients complete the recommended 5-year course of therapy.4-6 Failure to complete the recommended AI treatment is associated with an increased
risk of death.7 Although efforts to promote medication adherence have received substantial attention,8-10 there are limited
data regarding the efficacy of such interventions for patients with breast cancer.11
Currently, the cost of a 1-month supply of AIs can vary from $15 for generic anastrozole to $500 for brand-name
letrozole, compared with $15 for generic tamoxifen.12 Although Medicare provides coverage for AIs, patient copayments for these agents can be $30 or more per month.13 Medication adherence reportedly was significantly lower
among AI users who experienced higher out-of-pocket costs ($15 per month).6,14,15 Out-of-pocket costs may be even
higher once patients enter the “doughnut hole” in the Medicare Part D program, and reaching this coverage gap is associated with substantial reductions in adherence to AIs.15 Recent evidence suggests that reducing or removing patient
cost sharing for essential drugs is a potential cost-effective strategy for enhancing medication adherence and improving
health outcomes in patients with various chronic health conditions.16-18 We sought to evaluate the long-term health
and economic impact of providing full prescription coverage of AIs for Medicare beneficiaries with hormone receptorpositive early breast cancer.

Full Coverage for Aromatase Inhibitors/Ito et al

Figure 1. The Markov model structure is illustrated. At the decision node, patients were assigned to usual or full prescription coverage. Patients entered the model in the disease-free state. Depending on the type of prescription coverage, patients could discontinue aromatase inhibitors (AIs), continue but become nonadherent to AIs, or continue and remain adherent to AIs over the
initial 5-year treatment period (see definitions in the text). Every year, patients were at risk for locoregional recurrence, contralateral tumor, or distant metastases. Throughout the patients’ lifetime, all patients were at risk for death from causes unrelated to
breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model

We developed a Markov state-transition model simulating the use of AIs and the progression of breast cancer
based on a previously published model (Fig. 1).19 Over
the initial 5-year treatment period, patients could discontinue AIs (defined as having a 180-day gap during which
no prescription was filled in a given year), continue but
become nonadherent to AIs (defined as having a medication possession rate <80%), or continue and remain
adherent to AIs (defined as having a medication possession rate 80%).5 In the base case, we assumed that 30%
of patients who stopped taking AIs switched to tamoxifen
and completed the 5-year course of adjuvant hormone
therapy.6,20,21 Transition probabilities between health
states were determined as a function of the use of adjuvant
hormone therapy. The model used 1-year cycles, and the
cohort was followed over its lifetime. All analyses were
performed using TreeAge Pro Healthcare 2011 software
(TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, Mass).
Population

The model simulated the prognosis of a hypothetical
cohort of postmenopausal Medicare beneficiaries aged 65
years with hormone receptor-positive, stage I or II breast
cancer beginning a 5-year course of adjuvant AIs after primary therapy (mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery

with or without radiation).3,22 The cohort’s age was varied
in sensitivity analyses.
Interventions

We compared the impact of full prescription coverage for
AIs with the usual prescription coverage provided by the
Medicare Part D program. Under usual prescription coverage, it was assumed that Medicare covered 67% of the
drug cost of AIs (ie, $40 per month), and patients received
AIs by paying 33% of the drug cost (ie, $20 per
month).12,13,23 Under full prescription coverage, it was
assumed that Medicare paid for 100% of drug costs for
those patients who were adherent to therapy.
Parameters

The model parameters are summarized in Table 1 and are
described in greater detail in below.
Use of adjuvant hormone therapy

We simulated the temporal pattern of AI use based on an
analysis of pharmacy claims in a health maintenance organization in California.5 We modeled a linear decrease in
both continuation and adherence rates between years 1
and 5. Because the impact of full prescription coverage on
medication adherence among patients with breast cancer
has not been tested, we applied the improvement in adherence to statins observed in the Post-Myocardial

Clinical events

Incidence rates of breast cancer recurrence were taken
from the previous cost-effectiveness analysis and the 8year follow-up analysis of the Breast International Group
(BIG) 1-98 trial.24,25 Patients treated with 5 years of AIs
continue to derive a carry-over benefit, with a lower risk
of cancer recurrence, for an additional 5 years after the
2496

completion of therapy.24-26 Because there are no data on
whether such a carry-over benefit exists for patients who
did not complete the full 5-year course of AIs, we conservatively assumed that the length of treatment offset period
was equal to the duration of treatment, during which the
benefit of AIs declined linearly over time to zero. Incidence rates of breast cancer recurrence in patients who
received no adjuvant hormone therapy were estimated by
dividing rates of recurrence for patients who received 5
years of tamoxifen by the proportional recurrence reductions of tamoxifen from a meta-analysis by the Early

Quality of life

We assigned a utility to each health state that reflected the
preference for, or desirability of, that health state. Utilities
for breast cancer-related health states and adjuvant hormone therapy were taken from a published metaregression
of standard gamble scores collected from community
samples.29
Costs

Direct medical costs of breast cancer-related health states
were based on health insurance claims in a large Midwestern health care system.24,30 The societal cost of informal
caregiving for patients who received treatment for cancer
recurrence was obtained from a nationally representative
survey.31 We calculated a weighted average price of AIs
using an online pharmacy database12 and the current US
market share (ie, 58% for generic anastrozole, 29% for
generic letrozole, 9% for generic exemestane, 2% for
brand-name letrozole, 1% for brand-name anastrozole,
and 1% for brand-name exemestane).23 In sensitivity
analyses, we evaluated an alternate assumption that the
drug cost of AIs fell to that of the least expensive AIs (ie,
$15 per month for generic anastrozole). Because of the
substantial variation in the benefits offered by Medicare
Part D plans, we calculated a mean patient copayment for
each AI using an online Medicare plan finding tool.13 All
costs were inflated to 2011 dollars using the Consumer
Price Index for Medical Care for All Urban Consumers.32
Base-Case Analysis

In the base-case analysis, using the societal perspective, we
assumed that drug costs were entirely covered by society
(ie, patients and/or Medicare) for both usual and full prescription coverage, and providing full prescription coverage increased total drug spending only as a result of
improved adherence. We calculated the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of a target strategy as its addiCancer

tional cost divided by its additional health benefit compared with the competing strategy. Health benefits were
measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
We assumed a discount rate of 3% per year for both health
benefits and costs.33
Sensitivity Analyses

To assess the robustness of our findings, we performed
extensive deterministic sensitivity analyses. We obtained
ranges tested from 95% confidence intervals when available; otherwise, we used from 50% to 200% of the basecase estimates. In a secondary analysis, we examined the
perspective of Medicare. We also conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis in which the model was run using a
value for each parameter down randomly from the distribution assigned to that parameter.34 We ran 10,000 iterations to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve
demonstrating the probability that full prescription coverage is cost-effective at various willingness-to-pay thresholds compared with usual prescription coverage.
Model Validation

In the simulated cohort (mean age, 61 years), the 8-year
disease-free and overall survival rates were 72% and 82%,
respectively. These estimates calibrated well with observed
data from the BIG 1-98 trial.25
RESULTS
Base-Case Analysis

For patients receiving usual prescription coverage, average
quality-adjusted survival was 11.35 QALYs, and lifetime
costs were $83,002 (Table 2). For patients receiving full
prescription coverage, average quality-adjusted survival
was 11.38 QALYs, and lifetime costs were $82,728. Compared with usual prescription coverage, full prescription
coverage improved quality-adjusted survival by 0.03
QALYs per beneficiary and reduced costs by about $275
per beneficiary. Because it yielded greater health benefits
at a lower cost, full prescription coverage dominated the
strategy of usual prescription coverage. Savings from full

Sensitivity Analyses

At a conventional cost-effectiveness threshold of
$100,000 per QALY gained, our findings were robust to all model parameters (Fig. 2). Full prescription coverage would remain preferred as long as the
absolute increase in adherence from full prescription
coverage was at least 0.1%. Full prescription coverage
would remain cost saving (ie, would save both lives
and money) compared with usual prescription coverage if the absolute increase in adherence from full
prescription coverage was greater than 1.2%. Assuming a lower drug cost of AIs (ie, $15 per month for
generic anastrozole), cost saving from full prescription coverage increased to $359 per beneficiary.
2498

Repeating our analysis from the payer’s perspective,
the Medicare program incurred a larger increase in the
prescription drug cost of AIs under full prescription coverage than that incurred under the base-case assumption of
societal perspective. In contrast, full prescription coverage
resulted in smaller incremental savings in nondrug health
care costs from the perspective of Medicare, because the
cost of informal caregiving is not incurred by Medicare.
Overall, full prescription coverage cost Medicare an additional $518 per beneficiary. By using the perspective of
Medicare, the ICER for full prescription coverage was
$15,128 per QALY gained (Table 3). At a conventional
cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 per QALY
gained, full prescription coverage would remain preferred
as long as the absolute increase in adherence from full prescription coverage was at least 1.4%. Full prescription
coverage would become cost saving compared with usual
prescription coverage if the absolute increase in adherence

from full prescription coverage was greater than 17%.
Assuming a lower drug price of AIs (ie, $15 per month for
generic anastrozole), full prescription coverage reduced
the Medicare costs by $117 per beneficiary.
The results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis are
displayed in the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. From
the societal perspective, full prescription coverage was cost
saving from the societal perspective in 96% of simulations,
and its ICER was less than $100,000 per QALY gained in
99% of simulations (Fig. 3). From the Medicare perspective, full prescription coverage was cost saving in 0.04% of
simulations, and its ICER was less than $100,000 per
QALY gained in 98% of simulations (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
Our cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that, compared
with the current Medicare Part D drug benefit, eliminating patient cost sharing for AIs for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer would both improve health
outcomes and save money from the societal perspective.
We observed that the incremental cost of full prescription
coverage for AIs could be offset entirely by the cost reductions from additional cancer recurrences that are averted.
Average cost reductions of approximately $275 per beneficiary would save society almost $17 million for the

approximately 60,000 Medicare beneficiaries who receive
treatment for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer every year.22,35 Our results were robust to most of the
model assumptions. In particular, full prescription coverage would continue to be reasonably cost-effective even if
the increase in adherence was substantially smaller than
our base-case estimate.
Cost sharing is a ubiquitous feature of the US health
care system.36-38 And, as the burden of cost sharing continues to grow, patients may increasingly avoid essential
medical interventions.36,39,40 Studies of patients with a
variety of chronic health conditions have indicated that a
10% increase in patient cost sharing is associated with a
reduction of 1% to 6% in spending on prescription drugs
and an increase in the use of other resources, such as emergency departments and inpatient services.36,41 One-third
of patients with breast cancer report difficulty paying for
medical bills, and almost half report skipping treatment
or not filling prescriptions because of the cost.42,43 For
example, in a recent analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database evaluating
beneficiaries with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, those who had copayments greater than $15 per
month were >4 times more likely to abandon AIs than
those who had copayments of less than $4.99 per

month.15 Furthermore, 3.4 million (14%) Medicare Part
D beneficiaries reach the coverage gap each year.44 A lack
of financial assistance to help pay for drugs after reaching
the coverage gap has been associated with a doubling in
discontinuing essential drugs, including AIs.15,45
One logical response to these observations is to base
cost sharing on value, rather than acquisition costs. This
framework, widely known as value-based insurance design
(VBID), is an approach to encourage the use of potentially
life-saving, high-value services (ie, those that provide important health benefits relative to costs) by reducing or
removing copayments.46-48 For example, in a recent
randomized controlled trial of commercially insured
patients who were discharged from hospital after myocardial infarction, the elimination of patient cost sharing for
evidence-based therapies not only increased medication
adherence but also reduced the rates of major vascular
events without increasing overall health spending.17
Although VBID is encouraged by the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act and has been implemented
increasingly in the management of chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus,
and asthma,16,18,49 the concept of VBID is relatively novel
in cancer care.50 Our findings support a reconsideration
of how Medicare structures its benefits, especially for
2500

drugs with proven efficacy that are underused because of
cost constraints.51-54 In fact, in a sensitivity analysis conducted from the perspective of the Medicare program, we
observed that full prescription coverage for AIs, although
not cost saving, had a modest ICER and would be considered cost-effective relative to many interventions currently
covered by Medicare.55 While concerns mount over
increasing Medicare budgets, our analysis suggests that
lowering the drug cost of AIs to the level of the least expensive AI (ie, generic anastrozole) would make full prescription coverage cost saving also from the perspective of
the Medicare program.
Our analysis is subject to several limitations. First,
the estimated impact of eliminating patient cost sharing
was not based on breast cancer-specific studies. Although
our conclusion was robust to a range of assumptions about
model parameters, prospective studies in patients with
breast cancer are warranted. Second, we did not model
predictors of nonadherence to AIs, such as larger tumor
size, higher cytochrome P450 2D activity, history of mastectomy and radiation therapy, and follow-up by nononcologists.56 These predictors may have an independent
impact on the prognosis of breast cancer. Third, we did
not model the influence of toxicity profile of adjuvant
hormone therapy on drug use.57

Breast cancer is a costly disease for patients, health
care systems, and society. Thus, as the population ages
and the number of Medicare beneficiaries increases relative to the rest of the population, so will the number of
Medicare beneficiaries with hormone receptor-positive
early breast cancer and the share of national health expenditures allocated to cancer recurrence after primary therapy. This cost-effectiveness analysis of a hypothetical
cohort of Medicare beneficiaries suggests that, compared
with the current Medicare Part D drug benefit, the
elimination of patient cost sharing for adjuvant AIs for
hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer would both
improve health and save money from the societal
perspective.
