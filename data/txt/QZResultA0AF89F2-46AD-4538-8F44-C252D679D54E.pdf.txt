Abstract

Author Manuscript

Mechanisms that maintain cancer stem cells are crucial to tumor progression. The ID2 protein
underpins cancer hallmarks including the cancer stem cell state. HIFα transcription factors, most
notably HIF2α, are expressed in and required for maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs).
However, the pathways that are engaged by ID2 or drive HIF2α accumulation in CSCs have
remained unclear. We report that DYRK1A and DYRK1B kinases phosphorylate ID2 on
Threonine-27 (T27). Hypoxia down regulates this phosphorylation via inactivation of DYRK1,
whose activity is stimulated in normoxia by the oxygen sensing prolyl hydroxylase PHD1. ID2
binds to the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex, displaces VHL-associated Cullin-2, and impairs
HIF2α ubiquitylation and degradation. Phosphorylation of ID2-T27 by DYRK1 blocks ID2-VHL
interaction and preserves HIF2α ubiquitylation. In glioblastoma ID2 positively modulates HIF2α
activity. Conversely, elevated expression of DYRK1 phosphorylates ID2- T27, leading to HIF2α

destabilization, loss of glioma stemness, inhibition of tumor growth, and a more favorable
outcome for patients with glioblastoma.
The HIFα (Hypoxia Inducible Factors alpha) transcription factors are the key mediators of
the hypoxia response1. HIFα protein de-regulation in cancer can be triggered by mutation of
the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene, an event that hinders the negative control of HIFα
protein stability by the ubiquitin ligase activity of VHL. This notion has been especially
validated for HIF2α, the HIF isoform preferentially up-regulated in VHL-mutant tumors and
recently implicated as driver of cancer stem cells2-5. However, signaling events that link the
stem cell-intrinsic transcriptional machinery to pivotal mechanisms of HIF2α regulation in
cancer remain to be charted.

ID proteins (ID1 to ID4) are master regulators of stem cells that are hijacked during
tumorigenesis and foster self-renewal and angiogenesis6,7. While the pro-tumorigenic role of
ID proteins has been linked to the accumulation of mRNAs and proteins, it remains unclear
whether other mechanisms exist that deregulate ID activity in cancer cells. Among ID
proteins, ID2 is essential for tumor angiogenesis and glioma stemness and is a component of
the signature that predicts poor outcome in patients with high-grade glioma8-10.
We show that ID2 activity is restrained by DYRK1 kinase-mediated phosphorylation on T27
and hypoxia impairs this event by inhibiting DYRK1 activity. In hypoxic brain tumor cells,
active ID2 binds to and disrupts the VHL complex, thus preventing ubiquitin-mediated
proteasomal degradation of HIF2α. This is a novel mechanism that fosters cancer stem cells
and aggressiveness of human cancer.

Hypoxia regulates phosphorylation of ID2 by DYRK1

Author Manuscript

We used mass spectrometry to identify the phosphorylation sites of human ID2. Beside
Serine-511, we found that ID2 is phosphorylated on Serine-14 and Threonine-27 (Extended
Data Fig. 1a-c). A sequencing analysis of the ID2 gene in cancer revealed that the colorectal
cancer cell line HRT-18 harbors and expresses a mutant ID2-T27A protein (Extended Data
Fig. 2a, b). Threonine-27 of ID2 is highly conserved throughout evolution (Extended Data
Fig. 2c). The primary role of ID proteins is to preserve stem cell properties, a function
widely documented in neural stem cells (NSCs)12,13. Therefore, to interrogate the
significance of the ID2-T27A mutation, we tested the self-renewing capacity of ID2-null
NSCs reconstituted with wild type (WT) or ID2-T27A (Fig. 1a). Introduction of ID2-T27A
in ID2-null NSCs increased neurosphere formation in serial passages by more than 50%
when compared with WT ID2 (p = 0.00883-0.000229; t ratio = 4.772-12.597) and caused a
2.4-fold increase in cell expansion rate (40.5±1.7 vs. 16.7±0.831; p < 0.0001, Fig. 1b-d).
From the analysis of 18 candidate kinases, the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylationregulated protein kinases 1A and 1B (DYRK1A and DYRK1B) emerged as the only
enzymes able to phosphorylate T27 of ID2 (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2d). The sequence
surrounding the T27 residue in ID2 resembles the DYRK1 phosphorylation consensus motif
RX(X)(S/T)P and is highly conserved in different species (Extended Data Fig. 2c)14.
Antibodies against a phospho-T27-ID2 peptide confirmed that ID2 is phosphorylated by WT
but not the inactive DYRK1B-K140R kinase (Fig. 1a, f-h)15. Endogenous and exogenous

ID2 and ID2-T27A co-precipitated endogenous DYRK1A and DYRK1B (Fig. 1i, Extended
Data Fig. 2e). Treatment of glioma cells with harmine, a small molecule inhibitor of
DYRK116, or combined shRNA-mediated silencing of DYRK1A and DYRK1B reduced
ID2-T27 phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 2f, Fig. 3f).

Next, we sought to identify the regulatory mechanisms controlling ID2-T27
phosphorylation. Exposure of human GBM-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) to hypoxia or
hypoxia-mimicking agent cobalt chloride (CoCl2) caused loss of T27 phosphorylation (Fig.
2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a). Determination of ID2-T27 phosphorylation stoichiometry in the
neuronal cell line SK-N-SN revealed that 21.08% of ID2 was phosphorylated on T27 in
normoxia but the fraction dropped to 2.28% in hypoxic environment (Extended Data Fig. 3b,
c). Mirroring the reduction of ID2-T27 phosphorylation, CoCl2 reduced DYRK1 kinase
activity (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3d) and DYRK1 auto-phosphorylation, an event
required for the activity of DYRK1 kinase17 (Extended Data Fig. 3e-g). Similarly, exposure
of GSCs to low oxygen decreased tyrosine DYRK1A and DYRK1B auto-phosphorylation
(Fig. 2c, d).

Prolyl hydroxylases PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3 operate as direct sensors of cellular oxygen
concentration18,19. Immunoprecipitation using an antibody that recognizes hydroxyprolines
showed that DYRK1A and DYRK1B carry hydroxylated prolines and CoCl2 abrogated
DYRK1 prolyl hydroxylation (Fig. 2e). DYRK1A and DYRK1B interacted in vivo with
PHD1 (Fig. 2f) and the expression of PHD1 enhanced prolyl hydroxylation of both kinases
(Extended data Fig. 3h). In particular, DYRK1B interacted with PHD1 through the kinase
domain (Fig. 2g). The activity of DYRK1A and DYRK1B towards ID2-T27 was potentiated
by PHD1 in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2h, i). Thus, oxygen deprivation induces a constitutively
active ID2 by inactivating DYRK1 kinases, which are positively regulated substrates of
PHD1.

DYRK1 mediated phosphorylation of ID2 destabilizes HIF2α
We used human GSCs to interrogate the effects of DYRK1 and ID2-T27A on HIF2α and
glioma stemness. Lentiviral transduction of the DYRK1-resistant ID2-T27A mutant in
GSC#48 resulted in elevation of HIF2α and enhanced tumor sphere forming capacity as
measured by limiting dilution assay (LDA, Extended Data Fig. 4a-d). ID2-T27A-induced
accumulation of the HIF2α protein was independent of transcription (Extended Data Fig.
4e). When detectable, HIF1α mirrored HIF2α but with more limited changes (Extended
Data Fig. 4f).

Author Manuscript

Expression of DYRK1 in GSC#34 and GSC#31 reduced HIF2α, the HIF2α target TGFα
and the glioma stem cell marker SOX2 (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 4g, h). Also in this case
HIF2α mRNA was unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 4h, j). LDA and serial clonal
experiments showed that DYRK1-induced decrease of HIF2α attenuated glioma stemness
(Fig. 3b-d, Extended Data Fig. 4k). However, accumulation of HIF2α, expression of SOX2
and frequency of GSCs were restored by co-expression of DYRK1 and ID2-T27A but not
ID2 WT (Fig. 3a-d, Extended Data Fig. 4k). DYRK1-mediated inhibition of gliomasphere
formation was overridden by co-expression of non-degradable HIF2α (HIF2α-TM,

Extended Fig. 4l)20. Furthermore, silencing of DYRK1A or DYRK1B up-regulated HIF2α
and reduced pT27-ID2, with maximal effects after co-silencing of both kinases (Fig. 3e).
Next, we investigated the effects of DYRK1 and ID2-T27A on ubiquitylation and stability of
HIFα. DYRK1-mediated phosphorylation of T27 triggered HIFα ubiquitylation and
expression of ID2-T27A reverted DYRK1 effect (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Figure 5a).
Similarly, expression of DYRK1B prevented accumulation of HIF2α under hypoxia and coexpression of ID2-T27A abrogated this response (Fig. 3g). DYRK1 accelerated the decay of
HIF2α during recovery from exposure to CoCl2 and reduced HIF2α half-life and ID2-T27A
countered these effects (Fig. 3h, i, Extended Data Figure 5b, c).

ID2 binds and disrupts the VCB-Cul2 complex

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Mass spectrometry analysis of ID2 immunoaffinity complexes revealed that Elongin C, a
component of the VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase complex that includes VHL, Elongin C,
Elongin B, Cullin 2, and RBX1 is an ID2-associated protein (Supplementary Tables 1, 2).
The direct interaction of ID2 with Elongin C and VHL was confirmed in vitro and in vivo
(Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 5d, e). Conversely, ID2 was unable to bind to HIFα proteins
(Extended Data Fig. 5d). VHL and Elongin C interacted strongly with ID2, weakly with ID1
and ID3 and did not bind to ID4 (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 5f, g). The interaction between
ID2 and VHL was mediated by the N-terminal region of ID2 that includes T27 and did not
require the HLH domain (amino acids 35-76, Fig. 4c). A more detailed mapping of the
regions involved in the VHL-ID2 interaction revealed that amino acids 15-35 of ID2 and the
SOCS box of VHL (amino acids 154-174) were required for the binding (Fig. 4d, e).
Interestingly, mutation of lysine 159 (K159E), which provides the VHL contact surface for
binding to Cul221,22, impaired the interaction with ID2 (Fig. 4e). Consistent with ID2
deletion mapping analysis, an ID2 peptide composed of amino acids 14-34 bound to both
VHL and components of the VCB complex pre-assembled in insect cells. However, addition
of a phosphate to T27 or mutation of T27 to a bulky hydrophobic amino acid (T27W)
prevented the binding to both VHL and the VCB complex (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 5h).
These findings were corroborated by computational molecular docking whereby a Nterminally-derived ID2 peptide (amino acids 15-31) docked preferentially to a groove on the
molecular surface of VHL:Elongin C22 with the N-terminal half of its interaction surface
contacting the SOCS box of VHL that binds Cul2 (primarily K159) and the C-terminal half
(including T27) fitting snugly into a hydrophobic pocket mostly contributed by the Elongin
C surface (Extended Data Fig. 6a, c, d). Mutating T27 to phospho-T27 and re-docking
resulted in unfavorable energy and displacement of the peptide from this location on the
complex (Extended Data Fig. 6b). DYRK1 disrupted the interaction between VHL and WT
ID2 but did not affect the binding of VHL to ID2-T27A (Fig. 4g). Conversely, the
phosphomimic ID2-T27E mutant failed to bind VHL and did not promote accumulation of
HIF2α (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b). Next, we developed an in vitro assay using purified
proteins that included bacterially expressed FLAG-ID2, enzymatically active recombinant
DYRK1B and baculovirus-expressed VCB-Cul2 complex or purified VHL. In this system,
ID2 bound to VCB-Cul2 complex and VHL in the absence of active DYRK1B but the
interaction was disrupted by DYRK1-mediated phosphorylation of T27 (Fig. 4h, Extended
Data Fig. 7c).

In the VCB-Cul2 complex the Cul2 subunit provides the scaffold module for the interaction
with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)23,24. As we expressed ID2-T27A, ID2 was
loaded onto VCB and Cul2/RBX1 module dissociated from the complex in the absence of
changes in the total cellular levels of Cul2 and RBX1 (Fig. 4i). We also found that
challenging the pre-assembled VCB complex with increasing amounts of recombinant
FLAG-ID2 resulted in progressive dissociation of Cul2 (Fig. 4j). Expression of ID2-T27A
triggered comparable block of Elongin C-Cul2 association whereas it did not affect the
assembly of a Cul5-based complex containing SOCS2, a SOCS protein that cannot bind to
ID2-T27A (Extended Data Fig. 7d, e). Finally, in glioma cells in which ID2 and VHL are
present at a molar ratio of 5.8:1 (Extended Data Fig. 7f), hypoxia signaling promoted the
association between endogenous VHL and ID2 while dissociating Cul2 (Fig. 4k, Extended
Data Fig. 7g). Silencing of ID2 rescued the dissociation of Cul2 from VCB complex and
prevented HIF2α elevation (Fig. 4k). Together, these findings indicate that ID2 activation
stabilizes HIF2α by disabling VCB ubiquitin ligase via dissociation of Cul2.

A DYRK1-ID2 pathway controls HIF2α in glioma

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To ask whether activation of ID2 enhances HIF2α transcriptional activity in an unbiased
fashion, we used CINDy, an algorithm for high-fidelity reconstruction of post-translational
causal dependencies to interrogate whether ID2 can affect the activity of HIF2α on its
targets in the context of GBM25. When applied to a collection of 548 TCGA-derived GBM
samples, ID2 activity emerged as the modulator of the transcriptional connection between
HIF2α and its activated target genes (Fig. 5a, b). The activity of ID2 is estimated by the
VIPER algorithm, a computational tool designed to infer protein activity from gene
expression data26. When GBM samples were divided into two groups based on ID2 activity,
samples with higher ID2 activity showed significantly stronger correlation between HIF2α
and its targets than a set of random genes (p=0.001, Fig. 5a). This positive correlation was
absent in the cohort of GBM with low ID2 activity (p=0.093, Fig. 5b). Consistent with these
observations, we detected a marked reduction of HIF2α protein following acute deletion of
the ID2 gene in a mouse model of malignant glioma (Extended Data Fig. 8a)9. We
interrogated the effect of DYRK1 expression in mouse models of human glioma.
Tetracycline-induced expression of DYRK1B at levels comparable to normal brain
(Extended Data Fig. 8b), down-regulated HIF2α in glioma cells in vitro and in subcutaneous xenografts and reduced the expression of the HIF2α targets that promote stem cell
functions (Fig. 5c-e). Expression of DYRK1B also inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vivo,
resulting in tumor reduction (Fig. 5f, Extended Data Fig. 8c, d). Next, we evaluated the
antitumor effects of DYRK1B WT or the kinase inactive K140R mutant in an orthotopic
model of glioma (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Animals bearing glioma cells that expressed WT
DYRK1B manifested significantly increased survival and tumor latency relative to mice
bearing DYRK1B-K140R or vector transduced cells (Fig. 5g, h). Two out of seven mice in
the DYRK1B WT group developed tumors that failed to express exogenous DYRK1B
(Extended Data Fig. 8f). This result suggests that active DYRK1 kinase is incompatible with
tumor growth in this glioma model. Finally, higher DYRK1A and DYRK1B predicted a
more favorable clinical outcome for GBM patients, thus supporting the clinical significance
of DYRK1 activity in glioma (Fig. 5i, Extended Data Fig. 9a).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Here we report a novel mechanism of functional inactivation of the VHL ubiquitin ligase
that is independent of genetic mutations of the VHL gene. This mechanism is centered on
the ability of active ID2 to disrupt the VCB-Cul2 complex, leading to HIF2α stabilization.
We also unravel a hypoxia-directed cascade of events that by overriding the restraining effect
of DYRK1-mediated phosphorylation of ID2 on T27, culminates with ID2 activation and
HIF2α stabilization. The transcriptional activation of the ID2 gene, a HIFα target27, by
HIF2α generates a feed-forward ID2-HIF2α loop that further supports cancer stem cells and
glioma aggressiveness (Extended Data Fig. 10). By showing that PHD1-mediated prolyl
hydoxylation enhances the enzymatic activity of DYRK1 kinases towards ID2, our findings
provide a clue to the mechanism of DYRK1 inhibition in hypoxia. Thus, inhibition of
DYRK1 kinases is an oxygen-sensing signal that disables VBC-Cul2. The gene coding for
DYRK1A is gained in Down's syndrome, a disease characterized by impaired neural
proliferation during development28-30, reduced self-renewal and premature withdrawal from
cell cycle31. These findings are consistent with the notion that activation of DYRK1A and
DYRK1B inhibits proliferation and activates a cellular quiescence program32-37. It is
plausible that DYRK1-activating signals are negative regulators of self-renewal of both
normal and cancer stem cells. By phosphorylating ID2 on T27 DYRK1 weakens the core of
the stemness machinery centered on the ID2-HIF2α pathway. We suggest that together with
the control of ID2 activity, regulation of Sonic Hedgehog/Gli signaling and CREB-mediated
transcription by DYRK kinases cooperate to restrain stem cell functions and tumorigenesis
in the nervous system38-40. The glioma inhibitory effect of DYRK1 in the mouse and the
predictive value of DYRK1 expression on GBM patient survival support the tumor
suppressor function of DYRK1 kinases in vivo. Whereas there is consistency for the
negative role of DYRK1 towards stemness and cell proliferation31,35, the broad spectrum of
DYRK kinase substrates may account for the pro-tumorigenic functions of DYRK1 reported
by other studies41. It has been proposed that loss of DYRK1 and accumulation of ID2 and
HIF2α drive tumor progression of other cancer types, beside GBM. The mechanism
reported here might operate broadly during the transition of cancer cells towards the more
aggressive stem-like state that drives maintenance and progression of solid tumors.

Mouse neurosphere assay was performed by plating 2,000 cells in 35 mm dishes in collagen
containing NSC medium to ensure that distinct colonies were derived from single cells and
therefore clonal in origin43. We determined neurosphere formation over serial clonal
passages in limiting dilution semi-solid cultures and the cell expansion rate over passages,
which is considered a direct indication of self-renewing symmetric cell divisions44. For
serial sub-culturing we mechanically dissociated neurospheres into single cells in bulk and
re-cultured them under the same conditions for six passages. The number of spheres was
scored after 14 days. Only colonies >100 μm in diameter were counted as spheres.
Neurosphere size was determined by measuring the diameters of individual neurospheres
under light microscopy. Data are presented as percent of neurospheres obtained at each
passage (number of neurospheres scored/number of NSCs plated × 100) in three
independent experiments. p-value was calculated using a multiple t test with Holm-Sidak
correction for multiple comparisons. To determine the expansion rate, we plated 10,000 cells

from 3 independent P1 clonal assays in 35 mm dishes and scored the number of viable cells
after 7 days by Trypan Blue exclusion. Expansion rate of NSCs was determined using a
linear regression model and difference in the slopes (p-value) was determined by the
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Inc.). Limiting dilution assay
for human GSCs was performed as described previously45. Briefly, spheres were dissociated
into single cells and plated into 96-well plates in 0.2 ml of medium containing growth
factors at increasing densities (1-100 cells/well) in triplicate. Cultures were left undisturbed
for 14 days, and then the percentage of wells not containing spheres for each cell dilution
was calculated and plotted against the number of cells per well. Linear regression lines were
plotted, and we estimated the minimal frequency of glioma cells endowed with stem cell
capacity (the number of cells required to generate at least one sphere in every well = the
stem cell frequency) based on the Poisson distribution and the intersection at the 37% level
using Prism 6.0 software. Data represent the means of three independent experiments
performed in different days for the evaluation of the effects of ID2, ID2-T27A in the
presence or in the absence of DYRK1B. LDA for the undegradable HIF2α rescue
experiment was performed by using three cultures transduced independently on the same
day.
Identification of phosphorylation sites of ID2

Author Manuscript

To identify the sites of ID2 phosphorylation from IMR32 human neuroblastoma cells, the
immunoprecipitated ID2 protein was excised, digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin and LysC and the peptides extracted from the polyacrylamide in two 30 μl aliquots of 50%
acetonitrile/5% formic acid. These extracts were combined and evaporated to 25 μl for MS
analysis. The LC-MS system consisted of a state-of-the-art Finnigan LTQ-FT mass
spectrometer system with a Protana nanospray ion source interfaced to a self-packed 8 cm ×
75 mm id Phenomenex Jupiter 10 μm C18 reversed-phase capillary column. 0.5-5 μl
volumes of the extract were injected and the peptides eluted from the column by an
acetonitrile/0.1 M acetic acid gradient at a flow rate of 0.25 μl/min. The nanospray ion
source was operated at 2.8 kV. The digest was analyzed using the double play capability of
the instrument acquiring full scan mass spectra to determine peptide molecular weights and
product ion spectra to determine amino acid sequence in sequential scans. This mode of
analysis produces approximately 1200 CAD spectra of ions ranging in abundance over
several orders of magnitude. Tandem MS/MS experiments were performed on each
candidate phosphopeptide to verify its sequence and locate the phosphorylation site. A
signature of a phosphopeptide is the detection of loss of 98 daltons (the mass of phosphoric
acid) in the MS/MS spectrum. With this method, three phosphopeptides were found to carry
phosphorylations at residues Serine-5, Serine-14 and Threonine-27 of the ID2 protein.

Generation of phospho-ID2-T27 antibody
The anti-phospho-T27-ID2 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a short
synthetic peptide containing the phosphorylated T27 (CGISRSK-pT-PVDDPMS) (Yenzym
Antibodies, LLC). A two-step purification process was applied. First, antiserum was crossabsorbed against the phospho-peptide matrix to purify antibodies that recognize the
phosphorylated peptide. Then, the anti-serum was purified against the un-phosphorylated

bacterially purified GST-ID substrates were incubated with 10-20 ng each of the
recombinant active kinases. The reaction mixture included 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP
(PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM βglycerophosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.2

In vivo kinase assay in GSCs and glioma cells was performed using endogenous or
exogenously expressed DYRK1A and DYRK1B. Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer
[50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 50
mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM β-glycerolphosphate and
EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. DYRK1 kinases were immunoprecipitated
using DYRK1A and DYRK1B antibodies (for endogenous DYRK1 proteins) or GFP
antibody (for exogenous GFP-DYRK1 proteins) from 1 mg cellular lysates at 4°C.
Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer four times followed by two washes in
kinase buffer as described above and incubated with 200 ng purified ID2-FLAG protein in
kinase buffer for 30 min at 30°C. Kinase reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by western blot using p-T27-ID2 antibody.
Protein half-life and stoichiometry
HIF2α half-life was quantified using ImageJ processing software (NIH). Densitometry
values were analyzed by Prism 6.0 using the linear regression function. Stoichiometric
quantification of ID2 and VHL in U87 cells was obtained using recombinant ID2-FLAG and
His-tagged-VHL as references. The chemiluminescent signal of serial dilutions of the

(1×106 U87 cells) was calculated. Triplicate values±SEM were used to estimate the
ID2:VHL ratio/cell. The stoichiometry of pT27-ID2 phosphorylation was determined as
described46. Briefly, SK-N-SH cells were plated at density of 1×106 in 100 mm dishes.
Forty-eight h later 1.5 mg of cellular lysates from cells untreated or treated with CoCl2
during the previous 24 h were prepared in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated using 4 μg
of pT27-ID2 antibody or rabbit IgG overnight at 4°C. Immune complexes were collected
with TrueBlot anti-rabbit IgG beads (Rockland), washed 5 times in lysis buffer, and eluted in
SDS sample buffer. Serial dilutions of cellular lysates, IgG and pT27-ID2
immunoprecipitates were loaded as duplicate series for SDS-PAGE/western blot analysis
using ID2 or p-T27-ID2 antibodies. Densitometry quantification of the chemiluminescent
signals was used to determine i) the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation using the
antibody against p-ID2-T27 and ii) the ratio between efficiency of the immunoprecipitation
evaluated by western blot for p-T27-ID2 and total ID2 antibodies. This represents the
percent of phosphorylated T27-ID2 present in the cell preparation.
Identification of ID2 complexes by mass spectrometry

Author Manuscript

Cellular ID2 complexes were purified from the cell line NCI-H1299 stably engineered to
express FLAG-HA-ID2. Cellular lysates were prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl,
0.2% NP40, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. FLAG-HAID2 immunoprecipitates were recovered first with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated M2
agarose (Sigma) and washed with lysis buffer containing 300 mM NaCl and 0.3% NP40.
Bound polypeptides were eluted with FLAG peptide and further affinity purified by anti-HA
antibody-conjugated agarose (Roche). The eluates from the HA beads were analyzed
directly on long gradient reverse phase LC-MS/MS. A specificity score of proteins
interacting with ID2 was computed for each polypeptide by comparing the number of
peptides identified from our mass spectrometry analysis to those reported in the CRAPome
database that includes a list of potential contaminants from affinity purification-mass
spectrometry experiments (www.crapome.org). The specificity score is computed as
[(#peptide*#xcorr)/(AveSC*MaxSC* # of Expt.)], #peptide, identified peptide count; #xcorr,
the cross-correlation score for all candidate peptides queried from the database; AveSC,
averaged spectral counts from CRAPome; MaxSC, maximal spectral counts from
CRAPome; and # of Expt., the total found number of experiments from CRAPome.

Docking of ID2 peptide to the VCB complex

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A previously described47, highly accurate flexible peptide docking method implemented in
ICM software (Molsoft LLC, La Jolla CA) was used to dock ID2 peptides to VCB or
components thereof. A series of overlapping peptides of varying lengths were docked to the
complex of VHL and Elongin C (EloC), or VHL or EloC alone, from the recent
crystallographic structure22 of the VHL-CRL ligase. Briefly, an all-atom model of the
peptide was docked into grid potentials derived from the X-ray structure using a stochastic
global optimization in internal coordinates with pseudo-Brownian and collective
“probability-biased” random moves as implemented in the ICM program. Five types of
potentials for the peptide-receptor interaction energy – hydrogen van der Waals, nonhydrogen van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobicity and electrostatics – were
precomputed on a rectilinear grid with 0.5 Å spacing that fills a 34 Å × 34 Å × 25 Å box
containing the VHL-EloC (V-C) complex, to which the peptide was docked by searching its
full conformational space within the space of the grid potentials. The preferred docking
conformation was identified by the lowest energy conformation in the search. The preferred
peptide was identified by its maximal contact surface area with the respective receptor.

ab initio folding and analysis of the peptides was performed as previously described48,49. ab
initio folding of the ID2 peptide and its phospho-T27 mutant showed that both strongly
prefer an α-helical conformation free (unbound) in solution, with the phospho-T27 mutant
having a calculated free energy almost 50 kcal-equivalent units lower than the unmodified
peptide.

Mice were housed in pathogen-free animal facility. All animal studies were approved by the
IACUC at Columbia University (#AAAE9252; AAAE9956). Mice were 4-6 week old male
athymic nude (Nu/Nu, Charles River Laboratories). No statistical method was used to
predetermine sample size. No method of randomization was used to allocate animals to
experimental groups. Mice in the same cage were generally part of the same treatment. The
investigators were not blinded during outcome assessment. In none of the experiments did
tumors exceed the maximum volume allowed according to our IACUC protocol, specifically
20 mm in the maximum diameter. 2×105 U87 cells stably expressing a doxycycline
inducible lentiviral vector coding for DYRK1B or the empty vector were injected
subcutaneously in the right flank in 100 μl volume of saline solution (7 mice per each
group). Mice carrying 150-220 mm3 subcutaneous tumors (21 days from injection)
generated by cells transduced with DYRK1B were treated with vehicle or Doxycycline by
oral gavage (Vibramycin, Pfizer Labs; 8 mg/ml, 0.2 ml/die)51; mice carrying tumors
generated by cells transduced with the empty vector were also fed with Doxycycline. Tumor
diameters were measured daily with caliper and tumor volumes estimated using the formula:
width2 × length/2 = V (mm3). Mice were euthanized after 5 days of doxycycline treatment.
Tumors were dissected and fixed in formalin for immunohistochemical analysis. Data are
means ± s.d. of 7 mice in each group. Statistical significance was determined by the analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software package (GraphPad Inc.).

Orthotopic implantation of glioma cells was performed as described previously using 5×104
U87 cells transduced with pLOC-vector, pLOC-DYRK1B WT or pLOC-DYRK1B-K140R
mutant cells in 2 μl phosphate buffer42. In brief, 5 days after lentiviral infection, cells were
injected 2 mm lateral and 0.5 mm anterior to the bregma, 2.5 mm below the skull of 4-6
week old athymic nude (Nu/Nu, Charles River Laboratories) mice. Mice were monitored
daily for abnormal ill effects according to AAALAS guidelines and euthanized when
neurological symptoms were observed. Tumors were dissected and fixed in formalin for
immunohistochemical analysis and immunofluorescence using V5 antibody (Life
technologies, 46-0705) to identify exogenous DYRK1B and an antibody against human
vimentin (Sigma, V6630) to identify human glioma cells. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve
was generated using the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software package (GraphPad Inc.). Points on
the curves indicate glioma related deaths (n = 7 animals for each group, p was determined by
log rank analysis). We did not observe non-glioma related deaths. Mice injected with U87
cells transduced with pLOC-DYRK1B WT that did not show neurological signs on day 70
were sacrificed for histological evaluation and shown as tumor free mice in Fig. 5g.

Computational analysis of dependency of the HIF2α regulon on ID2 activity

Author Manuscript

To infer if ID2 modulates the interactions between HIF2α and its transcriptional targets we
used a modified version of MINDy53 algorithm, called CINDy25. CINDy uses adaptive
partitioning method to accurately estimate the full conditional mutual information between a
transcription factor and a target gene given the expression or activity of a signaling protein.
Briefly, for every pair of transcription factor and target gene of interest, it estimates the
mutual information i.e. how much information can be inferred about the target gene when
the expression of the transcription factor is known, conditioned on the expression/activity of
the signaling protein. It estimates this conditional mutual information by estimating the
multidimensional probability densities after partitioning the sample distribution using
adaptive partitioning method. We applied CINDy algorithm on gene expression data for 548
samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Since the activity level and not
the gene expression of ID2 is the determinant of its modulatory function i.e. the extent to
which it modulates the transcriptional network of HIF2α, we used an algorithm called
Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon analysis (VIPER) to infer the
activity of ID2 protein from its gene expression profile26. VIPER method allows the
computational inference of protein activity, on an individual sample basis, from gene
expression profile data. It uses the expression of genes that are most directly regulated by a
given protein, such as the targets of a transcription factor (TF), as an accurate reporter of its
activity. We defined the targets of ID2 by running ARACNe algorithm on 548 gene
expression profiles and use the inferred 106 targets to determine its activity (Supplementary
Table 3).

Author Manuscript

We applied CINDy on 277 targets of HIF2α represented in Ingenuity pathway analysis
(IPA) and for which gene expression data was available (Supplementary Table 4). Of these
277 targets, 77 are significantly modulated by ID2 activity (p-value ≤ 0.05). Among the set
of target genes whose expression was significantly positively correlated (p-value ≤ 0.05)
with the expression of HIF2α irrespective of the activity of ID2, i.e. correlation was
significant for samples with both high and low activity of ID2, the average expression of
target genes for a given expression of HIF2α was higher when the activity of ID2 was high.
The same set of target gene were more correlated in high ID2 activity samples compared to
any set of random genes of same size (Fig. 5a), whereas they were not in ID2 low activity

samples (Fig. 5b). We selected 25% of all samples with the highest/lowest ID2 activity to
calculate the correlation between HIF2α and its targets.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether regulation of ID2 by hypoxia might impact the correlation between
high ID2 activity and HIF2α shown in Fig. 5a, b we compared the effects of ID2 activity
versus ID2 expression for the transcriptional connection between HIF2α and its targets. We
selected 25% of all patients (n=548) in TCGA with high ID2 activity and 25% of patients
with low ID2 activity and tested the enrichment of significantly positively correlated targets
of HIF2α in each of the groups. This resulted in significant enrichment (p-value < 0.001) in
high ID2 activity but showed no significant enrichment (p-value = 0.093) in low ID2 activity
samples. Moreover, the difference in the enrichment score (ΔES) in these two groups was
statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). This significance is calculated by randomly
selecting the same number of genes as the positively correlated targets of HIF2α, and
calculating the ΔES for these randomly selected genes, giving ΔESrand. We repeated this step
1000 times to obtain 1000 ΔESrand that are used to build the null distribution (Extended Data
Fig. 9b). We used the null distribution to estimate p-value calculated as (# ΔES > ΔESrand)/
1000. Enrichment was observed only when ID2 activity was high but not when ID2 activity
was low, thus suggesting that ID2 activity directionally impacts the regulation of targets of
HIF2α by HIF2α. Consistently, the significant ΔES using ID2 activity suggests that ID2
activity is determinant of correlation between HIF2α and its targets.

Author Manuscript

Conversely, when we performed similar analysis using ID2 expression instead of ID2
activity, we found significant enrichment of positively correlated targets of HIF2α both in
samples with high expression (p-value=0.025) and low expression of ID2 (p-value=0.048).
Given the significant enrichment in both groups, we did not observe any significant
difference in the enrichment score in the two groups (p-value of ΔES = 0.338). Thus, while
the determination of the ID2 activity and its effects upon the HIF2α-targets connection by
VIPER and CINDy allowed us to determine the unidirectional positive link between high
ID2 activity and HIF2α transcription, a similar analysis performed using ID2 expression
contemplates the dual connection between ID2 and HIF2α.
Kaplan Meier analysis for DYRK1A and DYRK1B in human GBM

Author Manuscript

To test if expression of DYRK1A and DYRK1B are predictor of prognosis, we divided the
patients into two cohorts based on their relative expression compared to the mean expression
of all patients in GBM. First cohort contained the patients with high expression of both
DYRK1A and DYRK1B (n=101) and the other cohort contained patients with low
expression (n=128). We used average expression for both DYRK1A and DYRK1B, which
individually divide the patient cohort into half and half. However, when we use the condition
that patients should display higher or lower average expression of both these genes, then we
select approximately 19% for high expression and 24% for low expression. Selection of
these patients was entirely dependent on the overall expression of these genes in the entire
cohort rather than a predefined cutoff. Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed the significant
survival benefit for the patients having the high expression of both DYRK1A and DYRK1B
(p-value = 0.004) compared to the patients with low expression. When similar analysis was
performed using only the expression of DYRK1A or DYRK1B alone, the prediction was

compared to the predictions using the expression of both genes.

Extended Data Figure 10. Model for the regulation of HIFα stability by the DYRK1 kinase-ID2
pathway

Author Manuscript

In cellular contexts that favor HIFα protein instability (normal oxygen levels, but also low
ID2 expression and high DYRK1 expression) prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1) is active and
positively regulates DYRK1 kinases. Active, tyrosine phosphorylated DYRK1 kinases keep
ID2 under functional constraint by phosphorylation of Thr-27. The VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin
ligase complex efficiently ubiquitylates HIFα (left). With decreasing oxygenation and
PHD1 inactivation but also in the presence of downregulation of DYRK1, elevated
expression of ID2, or ID2-T27A mutation, the un-phosphorylated/un-phosphorylatable pool
of ID2 exerts an inhibitory function towards the VCB-Cul2 complex by binding directly
VHL and Elongin C proteins and displacing Cul2. This results in HIFα accumulation (right).
The transcriptional activation of the ID2 gene, a HIFα target, by HIF2α generates a feedforward ID2-HIF2α loop that amplifies the effects.

a, Phosphorylation of ID2 but not ID2-T27A by GFP-DYRK1B down-regulates glioma stem
cells markers in GSC#31. b, In vitro LDA of parallel cultures shows that decreased
frequency of gliomaspheres by DYRK1B is rescued by ID2-T27A. Data are means of 3
biological replicates ± s.d.; **: p = 0.0031 (vector versus DYRK1B); ***: p = 0.00022
(DYRK1B versus DYRK1B plus ID2-T27A). c, Microphotographs of representative cultures
in b. d, Serial clonal experiments of cells in b. Data are means of 3 biological replicates ±
s.d. of percent gliomaspheres; ***: p=0.00059-0.00007 for vector versus DYRK1B plus
vector; ***: p=0.0089-0.0008 for ID2-T27A plus DYRK1B versus DYRK1B plus vector;
n.s.: p=0.061-0.249 for ID2-T27A plus DYRK1B versus vector. e, Silencing of DYRK1
down-regulates pT27-ID2 and increases HIF2α in U87 cells. f, Ubiquitylation of HIF2α is
enhanced by DYRK1B and reduced by the ID2-T27A as evaluated by in vivo ubiquitylation
(left panels, MYC-Ub immunoprecipitation/HA-HIF2α western blot; right panels, whole
cell lysates, WCL). g, ID2-T27A elevates HIF2α and counters DYRK1B-mediated reduction
of HIF2α during hypoxia. h, ID2-T27A reverts DYRK1B-mediated decrease of HIF2α halflife during recovery from exposure to CoCl2. U87 were exposed to CoCl2 for 3 h followed
by CoCl2 washout. i, Quantification of HIF2α protein from the experiment in h.
