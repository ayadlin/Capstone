BACKGROUND: The combination of 3 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) and a
tailored, extended irradiation schedule has been used to treat patients with early Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the
authors’ group since 1981. The randomized H97-E trial (1997-2004) was designed to assess the impact of a slightly
reduced irradiation dose on the freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) rate. METHODS: Patients with supradiaphragmatic HL at clinical stages I and II who had 2 affected lymph node areas and a mediastinal mass ratio <0.33 were
randomized into an experimental arm (EA) and a control arm (CA). Patients in the EA received 3 cycles of ABVD followed by irradiation at 36 grays (Gy) to initially involved sites and 24 Gy to adjacent sites, the upper infradiaphragmatic area, and the spleen. Patients in the CA received the same chemotherapy regimen and the same irradiation
given at doses of 40 Gy and 30 Gy, respectively. Two hundred two patients who had received the CA treatment in 2
previous trials served as a historic control group (HCG). RESULTS: The 10-year FFTF and overall survival rates were
similar for the 89 patients in the EA (88.6% and 97.8%, respectively), for the 99 patients in the CA (92.6% and 95%,
respectively), and for the 202 patients in the HCG (91.9% and 92.9%, respectively). Surprisingly, the 10-year incidence
of severe or fatal complications was nil in the EA but reached 15.5% in the CA (P < .003) and 11.1% in the HCG.
CONCLUSIONS: Slightly lowering the radiation dose did not have an impact on the excellent cure rate among
patients with early HL but significantly reduced the rate of long-term, radiation-induced complications.

and prednisone (MOPP), 1 of the first multiagent chemotherapy regimens to be used in cancer treatment, were
associated with complete remission (CR) rates that peaked
at 70% to 80% in patients with advanced HL.2
Thus, at the beginning of the 1970s, an attractive
therapeutic option was to combine both types of therapies. In 1972, the St. Louis Hospital Group of Hematologists designed the H7210 study. This phase 2 trial
included 166 patients with supradiaphragmatic HL at CS
IA and CS II2A (ie, 2 lymph node sites) who received 3
cycles of MOPP followed by a mantle-field irradiation
(40 grays [Gy] to initially involved sites and 30 Gy to noninvolved sites). After this treatment, the CR rate reached
almost 100%: The rate of infradiaphragmatic recurrence
was 10% (vs 30%-50% after mantle-field irradiation3),
and the 7-year overall survival (OS) rate reached 93.5%.4
It was in that setting that, in 1981, the French West-East
Treatment Group for Leukemias and Other Blood Diseases (‘‘Groupe Ouest-Est d’Etudes des Leucémies et
Autres Maladies du Sang’’ [GOELAMS]) initiated a series
of prospective trials for treating HL at early stages.
From 1981 to 1988, 262 patients with supradiaphragmatic CS I and CS II HL were included in the H81-12
trial. That phase 2 study combined 3 courses of chemotherapy followed by a high-dose irradiation step. However, the 3 courses of MOPP that were used in the H7210
study were replaced by 3 courses of combined doxorubicin (Adriamycin), bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), a regiment that reportedly was at least as
powerful but less toxic in terms of secondary leukemias
and male sterility.5,6 ABVD-responding patients received
mantle-field irradiation (40 Gy to initially involved sites,
30 Gy to noninvolved sites) tailored according to the
patient’s initial HL clinical presentation. Moreover, to
sterilize the occult infradiaphragmatic disease that potentially was not eradicated by initial chemotherapy, an infradiaphragmatic irradiation field (from thoracic vertebra 12
[T12] to lumbar vertebra 3 [L3]) that included the spleen
(30 Gy) was added.7
This approach was maintained in the second GOELAMS study, the randomized H90-NB trial (19901996). In that trial, the control arm received the same
treatment that was received by the patients included in the
H81-12 trial (3 cycles of ABVD plus high-dose, tailored,
extended irradiation), whereas the experimental arm
received 3 courses of combined epirubicin, bleomycin,
vinblastine, methotrexate, and methylprednisolone
(EBVMP), a potentially low-toxicity regimen, followed
by the same irradiation. Although the 10-year OS rate was

Cancer

similar in both arms, the postchemotherapy CR and freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) rates in the experimental arm were lower than those in the control arm,
indicating that 3 courses of EBVMP had lower efficacy
than 3 courses of ABVD.8
In 1997, a third GOELAMS study, the randomized
H97-E trial, was designed for patients with early stage
HL. The control arm remained the same as in previous
GOELAMS trials, and the experimental arm was designed
to test whether reduced doses of radiation could be given
after the 3 cycles of ABVD without having an impact on
the FFTF and OS rates.
In the current study, we analyzed the 10-year results
of the H97-E study from 188 patients. Results from the
trial also were compared with the results from an historic
control group of 202 patients who had the same initial
characteristics and were treated between 1981 and 1996
according to the H81-12 trial and the control arm of the
H90-NB trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Staging of the Patients
All patients aged 18 years to 65 years with untreated HL
who were seen at 19 centers between October 1981 and
December 2004 were candidates for inclusion in the prospective trials designed by GOELAMS and approved by
the Ethical Committee of Ile de France. Initial investigations included lymph node biopsy for diagnosis and histologic classification, physical examination, systemic
symptoms evaluation, chest x-ray, lymphangiography
(until 1992) and thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scans (from 1993 onward), bone marrow
biopsy, and biologic evaluation, including blood count,
sedimentation rate, and kidney and liver chemistries. No
functional imaging studies (such as gallium scintigraphy
or positron emission tomography scans) were used to
stage or follow patients. The mediastinal mass ratio
(MMR) (ie, the maximum mediastinal tumor width divided by the thoracic width at vertebra T6) was measured
in all patients who had mediastinal disease. Patients were
staged in CS IA to CS IVB according to Ann Arbor
criteria.9
The H97-E Trial
Patients who were included in the H97-E trial had supradiaphragmatic CS I and II (A or B) disease with 2 characteristics: 1) an MMR <0.33 or no mediastinal disease and
2) 2 lymph node areas involved by disease among the

following sites: Waldeyer ring, right/left cervical lymph
nodes, right/left axillary lymph nodes, or mediastinal area
(including hilar lymph nodes). After verification of inclusion criteria by the central secretariat, patients signed an
informed consent form and then were randomized into 2
arms: the control arm and the experimental arm. Randomization tables were prepared centrally for each center
in blocks of 6 patients.
Patients in both arms received the same initial chemotherapy, which consisted of 3 cycles of ABVD (intravenously on Days 1 and 15: doxorubicin 25 mg/m2,
bleomycin 10 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2 plus methylprednisolone 120 mg/m2).
Patients with peripheral CS IA disease who were in CR
after the surgical excision of a unique, involved lymph
node received only 1 course of ABVD. From the second
cycle, chemotherapy (always given at the full dose) was
postponed until neutrophil and platelet counts were
>1000/lL and >80,000/lL, respectively. No neutrophil
growth factors were given except very occasionally.
Two to 3 weeks after chemotherapy was completed,
the remission status of patients in both arms was evaluated. CR was defined as the disappearance of all clinical
and radiologic signs of HL; partial remission (PR) was
defined as a decrease 50% in the size lymph nodes
lesions; and persistent/progressive disease was defined as a
decrease <50% in the size of lymph node lesions, or their
progression, or their reappearance.
The irradiation of chemotherapy-responding
patients in both arms started 4 to 5 weeks after the last
ABVD infusion. Target volumes were determined a few
days before the start of irradiation based on the patient’s
post-CT status. Supradiaphragmatic areas were treated
with 25-MeV photons generated by linear accelerators.
Conversely, the spleen and the upper infradiaphragmatic
field were treated with 15 MeV photons. Since 1995/
1996, the ‘‘record and verify’’ procedure was used by all
radiation therapy centers.
All patients received the same tailored supradiaphragmatic irradiation that patients received in previous
GOELAMS trials. The upper cervical areas (above the
level of cervical vertebra 3 [C3]) were irradiated only in
patients who had initially involved upper cervical lymph
nodes; the mediastinal area was irradiated only in patients
who initially had mediastinal disease or isolated, involved
right or left supraclavicular lymph nodes; and the axillary
area was irradiated only in patients who had involved axillary or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes. Two to 4
weeks after the completion of supradiaphragmatic irradia-

tion, patients in both arms received prophylactic irradiation of the spleen and the upper infradiaphragmatic area
(from T12 to L3) (Fig. 1).
Patients of the control arm who were in CR after
chemotherapy received full-dose irradiation, ie, 40 Gy to
initially involved sites (10 Gy per week) and 30 Gy to adjacent lymph node areas, the spleen, and the upper infradiaphragmatic area. Patients in the experimental arm who
were in CR after chemotherapy received reduced doses of
irradiation, ie, 36 Gy to initially involved sites (10 Gy per
week) and 24 Gy to adjacent uninvolved lymph nodes,
the upper infradiaphragmatic area, and the spleen.
Patients in both arms who were in PR after chemotherapy received the same irradiation dose as patients in
the control arm (40/30 Gy). Patients with progressive disease after chemotherapy received salvage therapies.

Evaluation of Post-Treatment
Status and Follow-Up
Four to 6 weeks after treatment completion, patients’
remission status was re-evaluated. A CR was defined as
the disappearance of all clinical and radiologic signs of
HL. Patients with a residual mediastinal mass, whether it
had remained stable or had decreased under irradiation,
also were considered in CR. Patients in both arms who
had progressive disease after irradiation received secondline treatments.
Remission status was checked every 3 months during the first year, then twice a year until the fifth year,
once a year until the 10th year, and every 18 to 24 months
thereafter. Thoracic and abdominal CT scans were
obtained every year during the first 5 years and each time
a disease recurrence was suspected.

Recurrences were diagnosed by biopsy or by fineneedle aspiration. Patients with recurrent disease received
intensive chemotherapy and focal irradiation whenever
possible. Second tumors, cardiac complications, and all
severe or life-threatening events were recorded carefully
along with all causes of death.
Historic Control Group
The 264 patients in the H81-12 trial and the 200 patients
in the H90-NB trial control arm received the same 3
cycles of ABVD and the same high-dose, tailored,
extended irradiation that was received by patients in the
H97-E control arm. Among them, 202 patients had the
same initial characteristics as patients in the H 97-E trial
and constituted the historic control group for the current
study.
Statistical Analysis
The randomized H97-E trial was designed using a pragmatic approach.10 Briefly, the objective of the trial design
was to select 1 of the 2 randomized treatments assuming
only that the retained treatment was not worse than the

Cancer

September 1, 2010

other treatment.11 Schwartz and Lellouch named this risk
c and demonstrated that this class of pragmatic trials has
an a risk equal to 1 and a b risk equal to zero.11 The main
consequence of this approach is that the trial conclusion
consists of selecting the best trial arm, which, eventually,
is adjusted by a tolerance margin.
The number of patients needed was determined
under the hypothesis that the 5-year FFTF rate was 95%
in the control arm and 95% in the experimental arm.
Assuming an error risk c of 10% and using the corresponding binomial approximations,12 the required sample size for the H97-E randomized trial was 180 patients.
The chi-square test or, when appropriate, the Fisher
exact test (2-tailed) was used to compare qualitative data.
All survival curves were calculated from the starting date
of chemotherapy, and observations were censored at the
stop date of December 2008. Curves were computed
according to the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared by using the log-rank test. A P value of .05 (2-sided)
was considered the limit of significance for each analysis.
To calculate FFTF, adverse events included the
lack of CR at treatment completion, the occurrence of

4057

Original Article

a disease recurrence, and death from any cause. To calculate OS, the events included were deaths from any
cause.
The primary endpoint of the trial was the 5-year
FFTF rate, and the secondary endpoint was the 5-year OS
rate. No interim analysis was planned. Patients were analyzed according to their group assignment (intention-totreat analysis).

RESULTS
Between May 1997 and December 2004, 197 patients
were assigned randomly to 1 of the 2 arms of the H97-E
trial. However, 9 patients dropped out of the study after
randomization, including 2 patients because they did not
fulfill criteria of early HL (they had >2 involved lymph
node areas), 6 other patients because they did not have
classic HL according to a central slide review by 1 of us
(J.B.; 5 patients had nodular lymphocyte-predominant
HL, and 1 patient had a non-HL), and 1 patient refused
the planned treatment.
Overall, 188 patients effectively participated in the
randomized H97-E trial. The 99 patients in the control
arm and the 89 patients in the experimental arm were similar in terms of age, sex, histologic subtypes, number and
sites of involved lymph node areas, and presence of systemic symptoms (Table 1).
At the completion of chemotherapy, 165 patients
(88.2%) patients were in CR, 21 patients were in PR, and
2 patients had persistent/progressive disease (generating 1
death). In total, 186 patients received radiation therapy.
Among the 165 patients in postchemotherapy CR, 164
patients remained in CR after radiation therapy, and 1
patient (in the control arm) died of febrile neutropenia
within 1 month after the completion of treatment. Conversely, the 21 patients who were in PR after chemotherapy entered into CR after full-dose radiation therapy.
Overall, 186 patients (98.4%) had achieved CR at the
completion of treatment.
Five recurrences developed 25 months to 91 months
(median, 54 months) after treatment completion (3 in the
control arm and 2 in the experimental arm). All patients
who developed recurrent disease entered into second, sustained CR. However, 1 of those patients later developed a
fatal T-cell non-HL (Fig. 2).
Three patients died in first CR, 1 from a road accident after 25 months in CR (experimental arm) and 2
from myocardial infarction that occurred 33 months and
63 months after the completion of treatment; in both

patients, the mediastinum was irradiated (40 Gy; control
arm) (Fig. 2).
Seven other patients suffered from severe or lifethreatening events in first CR, including myocardial infarction in 1 patient (mediastinal area not irradiated), cardiac arrhythmia in 1 patient (mediastinal area irradiated,
40 Gy), abdominal aortic stenosis in 1 patient (abdominal
area not irradiated), melanoma in 1 patient (area irradiated, 30 Gy), breast cancer in 2 patients (area irradiated in
both patients, 40 Gy), and esophageal cancer in 1 patient
(area not irradiated). All of these events developed in the
control arm. Overall, among the 9 lethal or life-threatening adverse events, 6 developed in an irradiated area (30
Gy, 1 patient; 40 Gy, 5 patients).
The 202 patients in the historic control group had
the same demographic characteristics as patients in the
H97-E trial (Table 1). At the completion of chemotherapy, 183 patients (90.6%) had achieved CR, 18 patients
were in PR, and 1 patient had persistent/progressive disease (and was rescued with intensive chemotherapy but
eventually died from bladder cancer). The 183 patients in

CR after ABVD remained in CR after radiation therapy,
whereas the 18 patients in PR after chemotherapy entered

(99.5%) patients had achieved CR at the completion of
treatment.
Seven recurrences developed 12 months to 71
months (median, 33 months) after treatment completion.
Six of seven patients who developed recurrent disease
entered into second CR, but it was only transitory in 5 of
those patients. Overall, only 1 patient remained alive in
second CR after 166 months, whereas the 6 other patients
died after 17 to 162 months.
In total, 9 patients died in first CR after 3 to 180
months in CR. Six patients died from a solid tumor,
including a colon tumor in 1 patient (area not irradiated),
an ovarian tumor in 1 patient (area not irradiated), a sarcoma in 1 patient (area irradiated, 40 Gy), a lung tumor
in 1 patient (area not irradiated), an esophageal tumor in
1 patient (area irradiated, 40 Gy), and a breast tumor in 1
patient (area irradiated, 40 Gy). Moreover, 1 patient died
of cardiac insufficiency (area irradiated, 40 Gy), 1 patient
died of an autoimmune disease, and 1 patient died from a
surgical shock during a pleural biopsy.
Twelve other patients suffered from severe adverse
events after 24 to 118 months (median, 63 months) in
first CR, including myocardial infarction in 3 patients
(area irradiated in 2 patients, 30 Gy), angina pectoris in 3
patients (area irradiated in 2 patients, 40 Gy), cardiac arrhythmia in 1 patient (area not irradiated), carotid stenosis in 1 patient (area irradiated, 40 Gy), melanoma in 1
patient, breast cancer in 1 patient (area irradiated, 40 Gy),
myelodysplastic syndrome in 1 patient, and acute myelocytic leukemia in 1 patient. Overall, among the 21 fatal or
life-threatening adverse events, 11 events developed in an
irradiated area (30 Gy in 2 patients, 40 Gy in 9 patients).
In December 2008, the median follow-up of the
182 living patients from the H97-E trial was 75 months
(range, 48-167 patients), and 158 of those patients had
been followed for >5 years. Conversely, the median follow-up for the 171 patients who remained alive in the historic control group was 190 months (range, 63-288
months).
The 5-year FFTF rate was similar in the experimental arm and the control arm of the H97-E trial (96.6% 
3.7% and 95.7%  4.1%, respectively), and the FFTF
rate for the historic control group also was almost the
same (95.1  2.9%). By 10 years, the FFTF rate remained
similar in the experimental arm (88.6%  11.4%), in the
control arm (92.6%  5.9%; P ¼ nonsignificant), and in

the historic control group (91.9%  3.7%; P ¼ nonsignificant) (Fig. 3A).
Conversely, the 10-year OS rate still was almost the
same in the experimental arm (97.8%  3.1%), in the
control arm (95%  4.9%; P ¼ nonsignificant), and in
the historic control group (92.9%  3.5%) (Fig. 3B).
The 10-year incidence of severe or fatal complications was
measured in both arms of the trial and in the historic control group. It was nil in the experimental arm versus
15.5%  10.4% in the control arm of the H97-E trial
(P < .003) and 11.1%  4.5% in the historic control
group (H97-E vs the historic control group: P ¼ nonsignificant) (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
The combination of a brief anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen with a tailored, extended irradiation
course started testing by the GOELAMS in 1981.7 This
combined approach is now used widely to treat patients
with early HL, because it definitely has been confirmed in
randomized studies that both the FFTF rate and the OS
rate are higher after combined treatment than after radiation therapy alone13-17 or chemotherapy alone.18
When we designed the H97-E trial, we decided to
conserve the previously used control arm (3 cycles of
ABVD with a tailored, extended irradiation at 40 Gy and
30 Gy).7 That more-than-focal irradiation was maintained
to sterilize any supradiphragmatic or infradiaphragmatic
foci of lymph node disease that initially may have passed
unnoticed or potentially may not have been eradicated by
initial chemotherapy. Currently, after initial chemotherapy,
focal radiation therapy is used more and more frequently,
because it has produced similar FFTF and OS rates as larger
fields of radiation19; irradiation of the para-aortic/splenic
region no longer is used for the same reasons.19
The experimental arm of the H97-E trial was
designed to test whether reduced doses of radiation (36
Gy and 24 Gy) could be given after chemotherapy without having an impact on FFTF and OS rates. This issue
was raised after the observation that the long-term incidence of solid tumors and cardiac events was correlated
with the irradiation dose, and particularly with the dose to
the mediastinum.20-22
Results from the H97-E trial demonstrated that, after 3 cycles of ABVD, the 2 slightly different doses of irra-

4060

diation did not have an impact on the 5-year or 10-year
rates of FFTF and OS. At the same time, these 2 doses of
irradiation generated a significant difference in the 10year incidence of fatal or severe complications (P ¼
.003). The observation that the incidence of these complications was similar in the historic control group and
the control arm (with the same proportion of bad events
developing in irradiated sites: 6 of 9 events in the H97-E
control arm and 11 of 21 events in the historic control
group) reinforced the robustness of the control treatment. The possibility cannot be excluded that such a
highly significant difference in the incidence of complications (for such a small difference in the radiation dose)
also may be caused in part by chance. However, recent
retrospective studies have confirmed that, the lower the
irradiation dose, the lower the incidence of secondary
tumors and cardiac complications.23-30 Because it was
demonstrated recently that doses of 30 Gy were sufficient to sterilize lymphadenopathies that already had disappeared under chemotherapy,31-33 it is plausible that,
in patients with early HL who are in CR after a brief regimen of ABVD chemotherapy, irradiation doses of 25 Gy
to 30 Gy limited to initially involved sites might be sufficient to maintain the high rate of FFTF observed in the
current trial.32,33
The recent demonstration of the excellent negative
predictive value of a new imaging technology,34-37 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDGPET), to assess remission status after a brief time on chemotherapy38 potentially opens a new possibility of treating
early stage HL with chemotherapy alone. Whether a negative FDG-PET result after 2 ABVD cycles will not allow
use of radiation therapy (at the price of 2 or 3 supplementary ABVD cycles) is so far unknown and awaits the
results of ongoing randomized trials.39
