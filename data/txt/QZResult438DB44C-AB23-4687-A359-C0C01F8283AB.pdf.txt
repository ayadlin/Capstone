Abstract

Author Manuscript

Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells, and its pathogenesis is poorly
understood. Here we report the massively parallel sequencing of 38 tumor genomes and their
comparison to matched normal DNAs. Several new and unexpected oncogenic mechanisms were
suggested by the pattern of somatic mutation across the dataset. These include the mutation of
genes involved in protein translation (seen in nearly half of the patients), genes involved in histone
methylation, and genes involved in blood coagulation. In addition, a broader than anticipated role
of NF-κB signaling was suggested by mutations in 11 members of the NF-κB pathway. Of
potential immediate clinical relevance, activating mutations of the kinase BRAF were observed in
4% of patients, suggesting the evaluation of BRAF inhibitors in multiple myeloma clinical trials.
These results indicate that cancer genome sequencing of large collections of samples will yield
new insights into cancer not anticipated by existing knowledge.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of mature B-lymphoid cells, and its
pathogenesis is only partially understood. About 40% of cases harbor chromosome
translocations resulting in over-expression of genes (including CCND1, CCND3, MAF,
MAFB, WHSC1/MMSET and FGFR3) via their juxtaposition to the immunoglobulin heavy
chain (IgH) locus1. Other cases exhibit hyperdiploidy. However, these abnormalities are

likely insufficient for malignant transformation because they are also observed in the premalignant syndrome known as monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS).
Malignant progression events include activation of MYC, FGFR3, KRAS and NRAS and
activation of the NF-κB pathway1-3. More recently, loss-of-function mutations in the histone
demethylase UTX/KDM6A have also been reported4.
A powerful way to understand the molecular basis of cancer is to sequence either the entire
genome or the protein-coding exome, comparing tumor to normal from the same patient in
order to identify the acquired somatic mutations. Recent reports have described the
sequencing of whole genomes from a single patient5-9. While informative, we hypothesized
that a larger number of cases would permit the identification of biologically relevant patterns
that would not otherwise be evident.

Landscape of MM mutations

Author Manuscript

We studied 38 MM patients (Supplementary Table 1), performing whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) for 23 patients and whole-exome sequencing (WES; assessing 164,687
exons) for 16 patients, with one patient analyzed by both approaches (Supplementary
Information). WES is a cost-effective strategy to identify protein-coding mutations, but
cannot detect non-coding mutations and rearrangements. We identified tumor-specific
mutations by comparing each tumor to its corresponding normal, using a series of
algorithms designed to detect point mutations, small insertions/deletions (indels) and other
rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. 1). Based on WGS, the frequency of tumor-specific
point mutations was 2.9 per million bases, corresponding to approximately 7,450 point
mutations per sample across the genome, including an average of 35 amino acid-changing
point mutations plus 21 chromosomal rearrangements disrupting protein-coding regions
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The mutation-calling algorithm was found to be highly
accurate, with a true positive rate of 95% for point mutations (Supplementary text,
Supplementary Tables 4 and 5, and Supplementary Fig. 2).

Author Manuscript

The mutation rate across the genome rate varied greatly depending on base composition,
with mutations at CpG dinucleotides occurring 4-fold more commonly than mutations at A
or T bases (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In addition, even after correction for base composition,
the mutation frequency in coding regions was lower than that observed in intronic and
intergenic regions (p < 1×10−16; Supplementary Fig. 3b), potentially owing to negative
selective pressure against mutations disrupting coding sequences. There is also a lower
mutation rate in intronic regions compared to intergenic regions (p < 1×10−16), which may
reflect transcription-coupled repair, as previously suggested10, 11. Consistent with this
explanation, we observed a lower mutation rate in introns of genes expressed in MM
compared to those not expressed (Fig. 1a).

Frequently mutated genes
We next focused on the distribution of somatic, non-silent protein-coding mutations. We
estimated statistical significance by comparison to the background distribution of mutations
(Supplementary Information). 10 genes showed statistically significant rates of proteinaltering mutations (‘significantly mutated genes’) at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of ≤0.10

(Table 1). To investigate their functional importance, we compared their predicted
consequence (based on evolutionary conservation and nature of the amino acid change) to
the distribution of all coding mutations. This analysis showed a dramatic skewing of
functional importance (FI) scores12 for the 10 significantly mutated genes (p = 7.6×10−14;
Fig. 1b), supporting their biological relevance. Even after RAS and p53 mutations are
excluded from the analysis, the skewing remained significant (p < 0.01).
We also examined the non-synonymous:synonymous (NS:S) mutation rate for the
significantly mutated genes. The expected NS:S ratio was 2.82 ± 0.15, whereas the observed
ratio was 39:0 for the significant genes (p < 0.0001), further strengthening the case that these
genes are likely drivers of the pathogenesis of MM, and are unlikely to simply be passenger
mutations.

Author Manuscript

The significantly mutated genes include three previously reported to have point mutations in
MM: KRAS and NRAS (10 and 9 cases, respectively (50%), p < 1×10−11, q < 1×10−6), and
TP53 (3 cases (8%), p = 5.1×10−6, q = 0.019). Interestingly, we identified 2 point mutations
(5%, p = 0.000027, q = 0.086) in CCND1 (cyclin D1), which has long been recognized as a
target of chromosomal translocation in MM, but for which point mutations have not been
observed previously in cancer.
The remaining 6 genes have not previously been known to be involved in cancer, and
suggest new aspects of the pathogenesis of MM.

Mutations affecting RNA processing and protein homeostasis

Author Manuscript

A striking finding of this study was the discovery of frequent mutations in genes involved in
RNA processing, protein translation and the unfolded protein response. Such mutations were
observed in nearly half of the patients.

Author Manuscript

The DIS3/RRP44 gene harbored mutations in 4/38 patients (11%, p = 2.4x10-6, q = 0.011).
DIS3 encodes a highly conserved RNA exonuclease which serves as the catalytic component
of the exosome complex involved in regulating the processing and abundance of all RNA
species13, 14. The four observed mutations occur at highly conserved regions (Fig. 2a) and
cluster within the RNB domain facing the enzyme's catalytic pocket (Fig. 2b). Two lines of
evidence suggest that the DIS3 mutations result in loss of function. First, 3 of the 4 tumors
with mutations exhibited loss of heterozygosity via deletion of the remaining DIS3 allele.
Second, two of the mutations have been functionally characterized in yeast and bacteria,
where they result in loss of enzymatic activity leading to the accumulation of their RNA
targets15, 16. Given that a key role of the exosome is the regulation of the available pool of
mRNAs available for translation17, these results suggest that DIS3 mutations may
dysregulate protein translation as an oncogenic mechanism in MM.
Further support for a role of translational control in the pathogenesis of MM comes from the
observation of mutations in the FAM46C gene in 5/38 (13%) patients (p < 1.8×10−10, q =
1×10−6). There is no published functional annotation of FAM46C, and its sequence lacks
obvious homology to known proteins. To gain insight into its cellular role, we examined its
pattern of gene expression across 414 MM samples and compared it to the expression of 395

gene sets curated in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), using the GSEA
algorithm18-20. The expression of FAM46C was highly correlated (q = 0.034 after multiple
hypothesis correction; Fig. 2c) to the expression of the set of ribosomal proteins, which are
known to be tightly co-regulated21. Strong correlation with eukaryotic initiation and
elongation factors involved in protein translation was similarly observed. While the precise
function of FAM46C remains unknown, this striking correlation provides strong evidence
that FAM46C is functionally related in some way to the regulation of translation.

Author Manuscript

Notably, while not statistically significant on their own, we found mutations in 5 other genes
related to protein translation, stability and the unfolded protein responses (Supplementary
Table 6), further supporting a role of translational control in MM. Of particular interest, two
patients had mutations in the unfolded protein response gene XBP1. Over-expression of a
particular splice form of XBP1 has been shown to cause a MM-like syndrome in mice,
although no role of XBP1 in the pathogenesis of human MM has been described22.
Of related interest, mutations of the LRRK2 gene were observed in 3/38 patients (8%;
Supplementary Table 6). LRRK2 encodes a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates
translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP). LRRK2 is best known for its role in
the predisposition to Parkinson's disease23, 24. Parkinson's disease and other
neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease are characterized in part by
aberrant unfolded protein responses25. Protein homeostasis may be particularly important in
MM because of the enormous rate of production immunoglobulins by MM cells26-28. The
finding is also of clinical significance because of the success of the drug bortezomib
(Velcade) that inhibits the proteasome and which shows remarkable activity in MM
compared to other tumor types29.

Author Manuscript

Together, these results indicate that mutations affecting protein translation and homeostasis
are extremely common in MM (at least 16/38 patients; 42%), thereby suggesting that
additional therapeutic approaches that target these mechanisms may be worth exploring.

Identical mutations suggest gain-of-function oncogenes

Author Manuscript

Another way to recognize biologically significant mutations is to search for recurrence of
identical mutations indicative of gain-of-function alterations in oncogenes. Two patients had
an identical mutation (K123R) in the DNA-binding domain of the interferon regulatory
factor IRF4. Interestingly, a recent RNA interference screen in MM showed that IRF4 was
required for MM survival, consistent with its role as a putative oncogene30. Genotyping for
this mutation in 161 additional MM identified two more patients with this mutation. IRF4 is
a transcriptional regulator of PRDM1 (BLIMP-1), and two of 38 sequenced patients also
exhibited PRDM1 mutations. PRDM1 is a transcription factor involved in plasma cell
differentiation, loss-of-function mutations of which occur in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma31-35.

Clinically actionable mutations in BRAF
Some mutations deserve attention because of their clinical relevance. One of our 38 patients
harboured a BRAF kinase mutation (G469A). While BRAF G469A has not previously been

observed in MM, this precise mutation is known to be activating and oncogenic36. We
genotyped an additional 161 MM patients for the 12 most common BRAF mutations and
found mutations in 7 patients (4%). Three of these were K601N and 4 were V600E (the
most common BRAF mutation in melanoma37). Our finding of common BRAF mutations in
MM has important clinical implications because such patients may benefit from treatment
with BRAF inhibitors, some of which show dramatic clinical activity38. Our results also
support the observation that inhibitors acting downstream of BRAF (e.g. MEK) may have
activity in MM39.

Gene set mutations: NF-κB pathway
Another approach to identify biologically relevant mutations in MM is to look not at the
frequency of mutation of individual genes, but rather of sets of genes.

Author Manuscript

We first considered gene sets based on existing insights into the biology of MM. For
example, activation of the NF-κB pathway is known in MM, but the basis of such activation
is only partially understood 2, 3. We observed 10 point mutations (p=0.016) and 4 structural
rearrangements, affecting 11 NF-κB pathway genes (Supplementary Table 7): BTRC,
CARD11, CYLD, IKBIP, IKBKB, MAP3K1, MAP3K14, RIPK4, TLR4, TNFRSF1A, and
TRAF3. Taken together, our findings greatly expand the mechanisms by which NF-κB may
be activated in MM.

Gene set mutations: histone modifying enzymes

Author Manuscript

We next looked for enrichment in mutations in histone-modifying enzymes. This hypothesis
arose because of our observation that the homeotic transcription factor HOXA9 was highly
expressed in a subset of MM patients, particularly those lacking known IgH translocations
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). HOXA9 expression is regulated primarily by histone
methyltransferases (HMT) including members of the MLL family. Sensitive RT-PCR
analysis showed that HOXA9 was in fact ubiquitously expressed in MM, with most cases
exhibiting biallelic expression consistent with dysregulation via an upstream HMT event
(Supplementary Figs. 4b,c). Accordingly, we looked for mutations in genes known to
directly regulate HOXA9. We found significant enrichment (p = 0.0024), with mutations in
MLL, MLL2, MLL3, UTX, WHSC1, and WHSC1L1.

Author Manuscript

HOXA9 is normally silenced by histone-3 lysine-27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) chromatin
marks when cells differentiate beyond the hematopoietic stem cell stage40, 41. This
repressive mark was weak or absent at the HOXA9 locus in most MM cell lines (Fig. 3a).
Moreover, there was inverse correlation between H3K27me3 levels and HOXA9 expression
(Fig. 3b), consistent with HMT dysfunction contributing to aberrant HOXA9 expression.
To establish the functional significance of HOXA9 expression in MM cells, we knocked
down its expression with 7 shRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 5). In 11/12 MM cell lines,
HOXA9-depleted cells exhibited a competitive disadvantage (Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Fig. 6).

Page 7

Author Manuscript

These experiments suggest that aberrant HOXA9 expression, caused at least in part by HMTrelated genomic events, plays a role in MM and may represent a new therapeutic target.
Further supporting a role of HOXA9 as a MM oncogene, array-based comparative genomic
hybridization identified focal amplifications of the HOXA locus in 5% of patients
(Supplementary Fig. 7).

Discovering new gene set mutations

Author Manuscript

We next asked whether it would be possible to discover pathways enriched for mutations in
the absence of prior knowledge. Accordingly, we examined 616 gene sets in the MSigDB
Canonical Pathways database. One top-ranking gene set was of particular interest because it
did not relate to genes known to be important in MM. This gene set encodes proteins
involved in the formation of the fibrin clot in the blood coagulation cascade. There were 6
mutations in 5/38 patients (16%, q = 0.0054), encoding 5 proteins (Supplementary Table 8).
RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of 4 of the 5 coagulation factors in MM cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The coagulation cascade involves a number of extracellular
proteases and their substrates and regulators, but their role in MM has not been suspected.
However, thrombin and fibrin have been shown to serve as mitogens in other cell types42,
and have been implicated in metastasis43. These observations suggest that coagulation factor
mutations should be explored more fully in human cancers.

Mutations in non-coding regions

Author Manuscript

Analyses of non-coding portions of the genome have not previously been reported in cancer.
We focused on non-coding regions with highest regulatory potential (RP). We defined
2.4×106 RP regions (Supplementary Fig. 9), averaging 280 base pairs (bp). We then treated
these regions as if they were protein-coding genes, subjecting them to the same permutation
analysis used for exonic regions.
We identified multiple non-coding regions with high frequencies of mutation which fell into
two classes (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 9). The first corresponds to regions of known
somatic hypermutation. These have a 1000-fold higher than expected mutation frequency, as
expected for post-germinal center B-cells (Supplementary Table 9). These regions comprise
immunoglobulin-coding genes and the 5′-UTR of the lymphoid oncogene, BCL6, as
reported44. Interestingly, we also found previously unrecognized mutations in the intergenic
region flanking BCL6 in 5 patients, indicating that somatic hypermutation likely occurs in
regions beyond the 5′ UTR and first intron of BCL6 (Table 2). Whether such non-coding
BCL6 mutations contribute to MM pathogenesis remains to be established.

Author Manuscript

The second class consisted of 18 non-coding regions with mutation frequencies beyond that
expected by chance (q < 0.25) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 10). Four of the 18 regions
flanked genes that also harbored coding mutations. Interestingly, we observed 7 mutations in
5 of 23 patients (22%) within non-coding regions of BCL7A, a putative tumor suppressor
gene discovered in the B-cell malignancy Burkitt lymphoma45, and which is also deleted or
hypermethylated in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas46, 47. The function of BCL7A is unknown,
and the effect of its non-coding mutations in MM remains to be established.

Our preliminary analysis of non-coding mutations suggests that non-exonic portions of the
genome may represent a previously untapped source of insight into the pathogenesis of
cancer.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The analysis of MM genomes reveals that mechanisms previously suspected to play a role in
the biology of MM (e.g. NF-κB activation and HMT dysfunction) may in fact play broad
roles by virtue of mutations in multiple members of these pathways. In addition, potentially
new mechanisms of transformation are suggested, including mutations in the RNA
exonuclease DIS3 and other genes involved in protein translation and homeostasis. Whether
these mutations are unique to MM or are common to other cancers remains to be
determined. Furthermore, frequent mutations in the oncogenic kinase BRAF were observed
– a finding that has immediate clinical translational implications.
Importantly, the majority of these discoveries could not have been made by sequencing only
a single MM genome – the complex patterns of pathway dysregulation required the analysis
of multiple genomes. Whole-exome sequencing revealed the substantial majority of the
significantly mutated genes. However, we note that half of total protein-coding mutations
occurred via chromosomal aberrations such as translocations, most of which would not have
been discovered by sequencing of the exome alone. Similarly, the recurrent point mutations
in non-coding regions would have been missed with sequencing directed only at coding
exons.

Author Manuscript

The analysis described here is preliminary. Additional MM genomes will be required to
establish the definitive genomic landscape of the disease and determine accurate estimates
of mutation frequency in the disease. The sequence data described here will be available
from the dbGaP repository (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) and we have created a MM
Genomics Portal (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mmgp) to support data analysis and
visualization.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

Informed consent from MM patients was obtained in line with the Declaration of Helsinki.
DNA was extracted from bone marrow aspirate (tumor) and blood (normal). WGS libraries
(370-410 bp inserts) and WES libraries (200-350 bp inserts) were constructed and
sequenced on an Illumina GA-II sequencer using 101 and 76 bp paired-end reads,
respectively. Sequencing reads were procesed with the Firehose pipeline, identifying
somatic point mutations, indels, and other structural chromosomal rearrangements.
Structural rearrangements affecting protein-coding regions were then subjected to manual
review to exclude alignment artifacts. True positive mutation rates were estimated by
Sequenom mass spectrometry genotyping of randomly selected mutations. HOXA9 shRNAs
were introduced into MM cell lines using lentiviral infection using standard methods.
A complete description of the materials and methods are provided in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 1. Evidence for transcription-coupled repair and functional importance (FI) of
statistically significant mutations

Author Manuscript

(a) Intronic mutation rates subdivided by gene expression rates in MM. Rates of gene
expression were estimated by proportion of Affymetrix Present (P) calls in 304 primary MM
samples. Error bars indicate standard deviation. (b) FI scores were generated for all point
mutations and divided into distributions for non-significant mutations (upper histogram) and
significant mutations (lower). Comparison of distributions is via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
statistic.

(a) H3K27Me3 enrichment at the HOXA9 promoter in CD34 cells, CD19 cells, and MM cell
lines relative to H3K27Me3 methylation at the BC site, known to be hypomethylated in all
cells. (b) Relative HOXA9 expression vs. H3K27Me3 enrichment at the HOXA9 locus. (c)
GFP competition assay in MM cell lines. Following lentiviral infection with seven HOXA9
shRNAs or a control shRNA targeting luciferase, GFP-positive cells were monitored by
flow cytometry and compared to the proportion of GFP-positive cells present in the
population 3 days post-infection (designated day 0). Error bars indicate standard error of the
mean and represent a minimum of 3 independent experiments.
