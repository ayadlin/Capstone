Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common
mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and are
caused by activating mutations of the KIT or platelet-derived
growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) tyrosine kinases. GISTs
can be successfully treated with imatinib mesylate, a selective
small-molecule protein kinase inhibitor that was first clinically approved to target the oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion protein kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia, but which
also potently inhibits KIT and PDGFR family members. The
mechanistic events by which KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibition
leads to clinical responses in GIST patients are not known in
detail. We report here that imatinib triggers GIST cell apoptosis in part through the up-regulation of soluble histone
H2AX, a core histone H2A variant. We found that untreated
GIST cells down-regulate H2AX in a pathway that involves KIT,
phosphoinositide-3-kinase, and the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery, and that the imatinib-mediated H2AX up-regulation
correlates with imatinib sensitivity. Depletion of H2AX attenuated the apoptotic response of GIST cells to imatinib. Soluble
H2AX was found to sensitize GIST cells to apoptosis by aberrant
chromatin aggregation and a transcriptional block. Our results
underscore the importance of H2AX as a human tumor
suppressor protein, provide mechanistic insights into imatinib-induced tumor cell apoptosis and establish H2AX as a
novel target in cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2685–92]

Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common
mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and are caused
by activating mutations of the KIT or platelet-derived growth
factor receptor a (PDGFRA) tyrosine kinases (1–3). GISTs can
be successfully treated with imatinib mesylate (imatinib, STI-571,
Gleevec; Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland; ref. 4), a selective
small-molecule protein kinase inhibitor that was first clinically
approved to target the oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion protein kinase in
chronic myelogenous leukemia (5), but which also potently inhibits
the PDGFR family members (PDGFRA, PDGFRB) and KIT (6).
Despite high initial response rates, durable complete responses
are rare, and the majority of GIST patients acquire resistance to

imatinib over time (7). The mechanistic events by which KIT/
PDGFRA kinase inhibition leads to clinical responses in GIST
patients are not known in detail. By identifying the biochemical
mediators of imatinib-induced GIST cell death, it might be possible
to develop innovative strategies to induce more complete
responses, overcome imatinib resistance, and to enable more
effective disease control with an aim toward cure. Moreover, a
better understanding of the mode of action of imatinib may help to
identify other tumor types that can be treated with small-molecule
protein kinase antagonists.
Histone variant H2AX is a major regulator of the cellular
response to DNA damage and has previously been shown to be
associated with cell death after cytotoxic therapy (8). H2AX
differs from core histone H2A by a unique COOH-terminal tail
that contains a highly conserved SQE motif with a serine residue
at position 139 (9). Ser139 becomes rapidly phosphorylated in
response to DNA damage, and protein kinases that have been
implicated in this event include ataxia-telangiectasia mutated
(ATM), ATM and Rad3-related and DNA-dependent protein kinase
(10–12). The phosphorylated form of H2AX has also been referred
to as g-H2AX (13). Histone H2AX is not essential for the initial
recognition of DNA damage (14), but it governs the DNA damage
response through interactions with proteins that recognize
phosphorylated H2AX such as MDC1 (15). H2AX has recently been
implicated in chromatin remodeling and sister chromatid recombination (16–19). Cells from H2AX-deficient mice are defective in
DNA double-strand break repair and show chromosomal instability, but animals are not particularly prone to develop cancer unless
p53 is absent (20–23). Phosphorylation of H2AX by c-jun-N-kinase
has recently been implicated in the induction of apoptosis after UV
irradiation (24).
All of these H2AX functions are associated with its nucleosomal
localization. However, there is compelling evidence that histone
proteins have activities outside their normal nucleosomal context.
In yeast, a surveillance system has been identified that monitors
the level of free, non-nucleosomal histone proteins that arise
predominantly during S phase where newly synthesized histones
need to be incorporated into nucleosomes behind the replication
fork (25, 26). It is conceivable that such control mechanisms are
particularly important following perturbations of replication fork
progression (27). Failure to maintain a tight control over the pool of
free histones can lead to excessive amounts of free histones and
deleterious cellular consequences, including chromatin defects,
abrogated transcription (28, 29), genomic instability, and impaired
cell viability (25).
We report here that imatinib induces apoptosis in GIST cells
in part through the up-regulation of free histone H2AX. We found
that GIST cells can down-regulate H2AX protein levels in a

KIT-dependent manner, and that the imatinib-induced increase of
H2AX protein levels sensitizes tumor cells to undergo cell death by
blocking active gene transcription. Collectively, our results
highlight the role of histone-mediated cytotoxicity in GIST cell
death induced by imatinib and establish an unexpected role of
H2AX in this process.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfections. The human GIST cell line GIST882 was
derived from an untreated metastatic GIST and maintained in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Mediatech, Herndon, VA),
1% L-glutamine, 50 units/mL penicillin (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD), and
50 Ag/mL streptomycin (Cambrex) as described earlier (30). The GIST48
cell line was derived from an imatinib-resistant GIST and was maintained
in Ham’s F-10 supplemented with 15% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 50 units/mL
penicillin (Cambrex), 50 Ag/mL streptomycin (Cambrex), 30 Ag/mL bovine
pituitary extract (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and 0.5% MITO+ Serum
Extender (Fisher Scientific).
IMR90 non-neoplastic human lung fibroblasts were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained
according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
GIST882 cells were transiently transfected by nucleofection (Amaxa,
Cologne, Germany). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, and 3  106 cells per
experiment were transfected with 5 Ag of plasmid DNA.
NH2-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion plasmids encoding
wild-type H2AX and H2AX in which Ser139 has been substituted with alanine
(H2AX-S139A) were a generous gift of Joseph S. Siino (University of
California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA) and Nicolai Tomilin
(Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia;
ref. 31). An empty pCMV-GFP vector was included as control in all
experiments. A plasmid encoding myc-tagged H2A was a generous gift of
Brian Chadwick and Huntington F. Willard (Institute for Genome Sciences
& Policy, Duke University, Durham, NC).
Heterozygous KitV558#/+ mice. Heterozygous KitV558D/+ mice were
generated as described by Sommer et al. (32) and treated with imatinib as
reported by Rossi et al. (33). Briefly, mice selected for treatment had no
apparent signs of disease and were 3 to 5 months old. The animals were
treated with 45 mg/kg imatinib mesylate or placebo twice per day for a total
of 24 h and were killed 6 h after the last administration of the drug. Tumors
were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for
histology and immunohistochemistry.
Immunologic and cell staining methods. Protein lysates of cells
growing as monolayer were prepared by scraping cells into radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [1% NP40, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
100 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 30 mmol/L sodium PPi, 2 mmol/L sodium
molybdate, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate] containing
protease inhibitors (10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were incubated for 1 h with shaking
at 4jC and then cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4jC.
Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). Thirty micrograms of protein were loaded on a 4% to 12%
Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose
membrane.
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown on coverslips were briefly
washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room
temperature. Cells were then washed in PBS and permeabilized with 1%
Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by washing in
PBS and blocking with 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4jC in a humid chamber
and incubated for another 3 h at 37jC the next morning. After a brief wash
in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC–anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Jackson Immunoresearch) for at least 2 h at 37jC, washed with PBS, and
counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were analyzed using an Olympus (Center Valley,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

PA) AX70 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a SpotRT digital
camera.
For immunofluorescence analysis of paraffin sections, slides were baked
at 65jC overnight, deparaffinized in xylene, and dehydrated in 100%
ethanol. After rehydration in a graded ethanol series, slides were washed in
distilled H2O and microwave treated in 0.01 mol/L sodium citrate for a total
of 30 min. Slides were cooled for at least 15 min and then washed in distilled
H2O and PBS. Blocking was carried out in 10% normal donkey serum for
30 min at room temperature. Incubations with primary and secondary
antibodies were done as described above.
Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
were monoclonal phospho-H2AX S139 (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA),
polyclonal phospho-H2AX S139 (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), H2AX (Bethyl
Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), H2A (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), phosphoKIT Y703 (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), KIT (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA), PARP (Zymed Laboratories), mono-ubiquitin
(BD Biosciences PharMingen, San Jose, CA), myc-tag (Cell Signaling),
ORC2 (BD Biosciences PharMingen), actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), phosphorylated (S473) and total AKT (Cell Signaling), and phosphorylated
(S2448) and total mTOR (Cell Signaling).
Apoptotic cells were visualized using the In situ Cell Death Detection Kit
(Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
Inhibitor treatments. Cells were incubated in 1 Amol/L imatinib
mesylate (kindly provided by Novartis) dissolved in DMSO or mock treated
(0.1% DMSO) for up to 72 h. The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (EMD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA) was used at 100 Amol/L either alone or in
combination with 1 Amol/L imatinib for 24 h. Other treatments included
the proteasome inhibitor Z-L3VS (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) at
1 Amol/L, the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 at
increasing concentrations up to 25 Amol/L (EMD Biosciences) as indicated,
the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 at increasing concentrations up to 200 nmol/L
(EMD Biosciences) as indicated, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin at 20 nmol/L
(EMD Biosciences) and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor U0126 at 10 Amol/L
(EMD Biosciences), all in DMSO for 24 h. The RNA polymerase II inhibitor
a-amanitin (Sigma) was reconstituted in distilled H2O at 1 mg/mL and used
at the indicated concentrations.
Small interfering RNA. Pooled synthetic RNA duplexes were used to
reduce KIT or H2AX protein expression (siGENOME SmartPool, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, and Silencer, Ambion, Austin, TX, respectively). Briefly,
GIST882 cells were trypsinized, and 3  106 cells were transfected with 5 AL
of 20 Amol/L annealed RNA duplexes using nucleofection (Amaxa). Cells
were then transferred to 35-mm tissue culture dishes with 2 mL RPMI 1640
free of antibiotics. Experiments were done at the indicated time points.
Ubiquitination assay. To assess the ubiquitination of H2AX in GIST
cells, proteins from GIST882 cells were extracted in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
0.25 mmol/L EDTA containing 2 mmol/L DTT, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, and
10 Ag/mL aprotinin. The suspension was spun at 10,000  g for 10 min at
4jC, and the supernatant (S-10 fraction) was collected. Per ubiquitination
reaction, 0.5 Ag of recombinant human H2AX protein (Upstate) was
incubated in GIST882 cell extract containing an ATP-regeneration system
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L ATP, 10 mmol/L
phosphocreatine, 1.5 units/mL creatine phosphokinase], together with
1 Amol/L ubiquitin aldehyde, 100 Amol/L methyl ubiquitin (both Boston
Biochem, Cambridge, MA), 1 mmol/L DTT, and 10 nmol/L okadaic acid.
The reaction was carried out at 37jC for up to 90 min, and aliquots
were taken at various time points. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS
sample loading buffer and heating the samples to 95jC. Proteins were
separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and analyzed for ubiquitination of
H2AX by staining with a mouse monoclonal antibody to mono-ubiquitin
(BD Biosciences PharMingen).
Chromatin fractionation. Chromatin fractionation was done according
to Mendez and Stillman (34). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, collected by
centrifugation at 1,100 rpm for 10 min, and washed once with PBS. The cell
pellet was resuspended in Buffer A [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mmol/L
KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L NaF, 340 mmol/L sucrose, 10% glycerol,

1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 Ag/mL leupeptin, 5 Ag/mL
aprotinin] and incubated on ice for 5 min. The nuclear pellet (P1) was
collected by low-speed centrifugation at 1,300  g. The supernatant (S1) was
clarified by high-speed centrifugation at 16,000  g for 15 min at 4jC
yielding the soluble cytoplasmic fraction (S2). The nuclei were washed once
in Buffer A and then lysed in Buffer B (3 mmol/L EDTA, 0.2 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L PMSF, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
5 Ag/mL leupeptin, 5 Ag/mL aprotinin) for 10 min on ice. The insoluble
chromatin fraction (P3) was collected by centrifugation at 1,700  g at 4jC
for 5 min. The supernatant contained the soluble nuclear proteins (S3). The
chromatin pellet (P3) was washed once in Buffer B and resuspended in SDS
sample buffer. The DNA was sheared by sonication for 15 s in a 550 Sonic
Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific) at 15% amplitude.
In vitro transcription assay. In vitro transcription was measured by
using HeLa cell nuclear extract in a defined, cell-free system (HeLaScribe,
Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
In brief, the transcription reactions were carried out at 30jC for 60 min in
a total volume of 25 AL containing 3.4 AL of HeLa cell nuclear extract
(9 mg/mL), 400 nmol/L each of rATP, rCTP, and rUTP, 16 nmol/L rGTP,
10 ACi [a-32P] rGTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 20 mmol/L HEPES,
100 mmol/L KCl, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 20% glycerol, and
100 ng of a 1,188-bp DNA restriction fragment containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter (Promega). Various amounts
(0.01, 0.1, 1, and 5 Ag) of recombinant human histone H2AX (Upstate) were
added to the reaction as indicated. The reaction was stopped by adding
175 AL of 0.3 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.3 mol/L sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS,
2 mmol/L EDTA, and 3 Ag/mL tRNA. RNA was extracted with phenol/
chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and
70% ethanol and resuspended in 15 AL of nuclease-free water. An equal
amount of loading dye (98% formamide, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% xylene
cyanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) was added before heating the samples
at 90jC for 10 min and loading them onto a 6% Novex TBE-Urea gel
(Invitrogen). The gel was run at 180 V for 60 min, wrapped in plastic wrap,
and exposed to an X-ray film overnight at 70jC with an intensifying screen.

Results
Imatinib induces a delayed apoptotic response. To determine
the kinetics of GIST cell apoptosis following imatinib treatment,
we used the human GIST cell line GIST882, which carries a
constitutively activating homozygous KIT mutation in exon 13
(K642E) corresponding to the first lobe of the split kinase domain
(30). GIST882 is one of only a few GIST cell lines currently available
that are sensitive to imatinib. Cells were treated with 1 Amol/L
imatinib or mock treated with 0.1% DMSO for up to 72 h, and the
frequency of apoptotic cells was measured by terminal nucleotidyl
transferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Fig. 1A).
Although an increase of apoptosis became detectable after
24 h from 0.6% in controls to 5% in imatinib-treated populations
(P V 0.01), a major effect on cell viability was not observed until
72 h with an increase of apoptotic cells from 0.5% in controls to
61.4% in treated populations (P V 0.0001; Fig. 1B). These results
show that the apoptotic response of GIST cells to imatinib is time
dependent, and that a major increase of cell death occurs with a
considerable delay after onset of treatment.
Imatinib induces an up-regulation of soluble histone H2AX
in GIST cells. Histone H2AX has previously been implicated in
cell death following cytotoxic therapy (35). To explore mechanisms
of imatinib-induced tumor cell apoptosis, we analyzed g-H2AX
expression in imatinib and mock-treated GIST882 cells by immunoblotting. Imatinib induced a massive increase of g-H2AX levels
at 72 h, which was already evident at 8 h (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly,
this imatinib-induced g-H2AX overexpression was accompanied

by an increase in total H2AX protein levels (Fig. 2A). Remarkably,
no increase of core histone H2A was found in imatinib-treated cells
(Fig. 2B).
The fact that experiments were done using whole cell extracts
and a standard lysis buffer without acid histone extraction
prompted us to investigate whether the increase of g-H2AX and
H2AX was due to soluble H2AX proteins. We obtained subcellular
fractions (S2, cytoplasmic; S3, soluble nuclear; P3, chromatin;
ref. 34) from imatinib- and mock-treated GIST882 cells. Whereas in
mock-treated cells, both g-H2AX and H2AX were detected only in
the P3 fraction by immunoblotting, imatinib-treated cells showed
mislocalization of both g-H2AX and H2AX to soluble cytoplasmic,
and to a lesser extent, nuclear fractions (Fig. 2C), suggesting
that mostly soluble H2AX accounts for the massive increase shown
in Fig. 2A.
The up-regulation of soluble H2AX in imatinib-treated GIST882
was causally related to inhibition of the KIT oncoprotein because
an increase of g-H2AX and H2AX was seen in GIST cells after KIT
knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA; Fig. 2D). Moreover,
H2AX protein expression was not detected in tissue samples
obtained from untreated primary human GISTs with known
activating mutations of the KIT oncoprotein (data not shown).
We next explored whether imatinib-induced H2AX up-regulation
is due to increased protein stability. The ubiquitin-proteasome
machinery represents the major pathway that regulates protein
turnover in cells (36). When GIST882 and non-neoplastic human
fibroblasts (IMR90) were treated with a proteasome inhibitor,
increased g-H2AX and H2AX levels were detected in GIST882 cells

but not in IMR90 cells (Fig. 2E). Because these results suggest that
H2AX is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we tested
whether H2AX becomes polyubiquitinated in GIST cells. An in vitro
ubiquitination assay using recombinant human H2AX as substrate
showed that GIST882 cell lysate promotes the polyubiquitination
of human recombinant H2AX (Fig. 2F). These results suggest
that oncogenic KIT decreases H2AX levels through stimulation of
its ubiquitin-mediated degradation and is in line with findings that
H2AX mRNA levels were not up-regulated in a GIST mouse model
after imatinib treatment.7
Signaling events responsible for the up-regulation of H2AX
levels were evaluated by treating GIST882 cells with other smallmolecule inhibitors that target protein kinases downstream of
KIT. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 induced g-H2AX and H2AX

levels similar to imatinib, whereas the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126
did not (Fig. 2G). Treatment of GIST882 cells with ZSTK474, a
PI3K inhibitor that binds to different amino acid sites in the ATPbinding pocket of PI3K than LY294002 (37), likewise led to an
increase of g-H2AX and H2AX (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin did not trigger an increase of g-H2AX
and H2AX levels.
LY294002 is not a specific inhibitor of PI3K and, at the
concentration above, equally inhibits PI3K and mTOR (38). mTOR
exists in two functionally distinct complexes in mammalian
cells, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 (39). Rapamycin
only partially inhibits mTORC1, whereas LY294002 inhibits both,
mTORC1 and mTORC2. To investigate the role of PI3K in
comparison to mTOR inhibition in more detail, we did a doseresponse analysis of GIST882 cells treated with increasing
concentrations of LY294002. We found up-regulation of g-H2AX
and H2AX at concentrations that led to reduced levels of phosphoAKT and at the same time a reduced phosphorylation of mTOR at

S2448 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Our experiments therefore raise
the possibility that the up-regulation of H2AX is a consequence of a
combined effect of PI3K- and mTOR-inhibition. In line with this
notion is the finding that treatment of GIST882 cells with both
LY294002 and rapamycin has a synergistic effect on GIST cell
apoptosis (40).
To determine whether H2AX up-regulation correlates with
imatinib sensitivity in GIST, we compared H2AX induction in
imatinib-sensitive cells (GIST882) versus a cell line derived from a
clinically resistant GIST (GIST48) with a secondary KIT mutation in
exon 17 (D820A) conferring imatinib resistance. GIST48 cells did
not show H2AX up-regulation after imatinib treatment (Fig. 2H).
However, inhibition of the PI3K pathway with LY294002 led to a
significant increase of apoptotic cells in imatinib-resistant GIST48
compared with cells treated with DMSO or imatinib (data not
shown).
The up-regulation of soluble H2AX in GIST cells is a cause
and not a consequence of apoptosis. A release of free histone
proteins into the cytoplasm has been previously reported to occur
during apoptosis (41). Although our finding that core histone H2A
does not increase following imatinib treatment (Fig. 2B) suggests
that the up-regulation of H2AX is not due to a nonspecific release
of histone proteins, we did a series of additional experiments to
establish that H2AX up-regulation is a cause and not merely a
consequence of apoptosis.
Several lines of evidence support our hypothesis that H2AX has
direct proapoptotic activities. First and most importantly, ectopic
expression of H2AX was found to stimulate enhanced cell death.
GIST882 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged H2AX

or mutated H2AX in which Ser139 has been replaced by alanine
(H2AX-S139A; ref. 31). An immunoblot analysis of subcellular
fractions confirmed that transient transfection of H2AX or H2AXS139A results in free, non-nucleosomal histone proteins (data not
shown). Transfected cells were identified by GFP positivity, and
apoptotic cells were assessed based on nuclear morphology and
TUNEL staining (Fig. 3A). A 16.4-fold increase of apoptotic cells
was detected between empty GFP vector-transfected controls
(1.6%) and H2AX-transfected cells (26.2%; P V 0.005) at 24 h, and a
4.5-fold increase of apoptotic cells from 8.9% in empty vector
controls to 39.8% in H2AX-transfected cells at 48 h (P V 0.005;
Fig. 3B). This increase in apoptotic cells coincided with caspase-3
cleavage as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3C). Transfection
of cells with H2AX-S139A still caused a significant increase of
apoptotic cells at both time points (8.1% at 24 h and 19.6% at 48 h;
P V 0.05), albeit to a lesser extent than wild-type H2AX, suggesting
that proapoptotic functions of H2AX in GIST cells rely in only part
on activities associated with phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139.
Transfection of GIST cells with core histone H2A did not cause
enhanced apoptosis when compared with cells transfected with
empty control vector (Fig. 3D and E).
Second, we found that the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK effectively
inhibited apoptosis as measured by poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase
(PARP) cleavage in imatinib-treated GIST882 cells, but had no effect on
the imatinib-induced up-regulation of H2AX expression (Fig. 3F). This
finding stands in contrast to a previous report (41), in which the apoptotic release of free histone proteins into the cytoplasm was blocked
by Z-VAD-FMK, hence further supporting our hypothesis that in our
model, H2AX up-regulation is not simply a consequence of apoptosis.

Contributions of H2AX to imatinib-induced GIST cell death were
determined by siRNA-mediated knockdown of H2AX in imatinibtreated GIST882 cells (Fig. 4A). GIST882 cells were cotransfected
with DsRED as a transfection marker and analyzed for apoptotic
morphology (Fig. 4B). A 2.2-fold increase of surviving cells was
detected in imatinib-treated cell populations transfected with
H2AX siRNAs compared with cells transfected with control siRNA
(P V 0.01; Fig. 4C), indicating that up-regulation of H2AX is in part
involved in imatinib-induced apoptosis in GIST cells.
Collectively, these results suggest that the apoptotic effect of
imatinib on tumor cells expressing tyrosine kinase oncoproteins is
channeled, at least in part, through the induction of excessive levels
of soluble H2AX.
Up-regulation of ;-H2AX in a GIST mouse model following
treatment with imatinib. To determine the in vivo relevance of
g-H2AX up-regulation following imatinib treatment of GISTs, we
used a GIST mouse model in which animals that carry a
heterozygous Kit exon 11 activating mutation (Kit V558D/+; ref. 32)
were treated with imatinib or placebo (33). Tumor samples were
obtained after 24 h of imatinib therapy and analyzed for g-H2AX
by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). Scattered g-H2AX–
positive tumor cells were readily detectable in imatinib-treated
animals but not in mock-treated mice (Fig. 5A) and corresponded
well with the amount of cells positive for cleaved caspase-3 (33).
Remarkably, many tumor cells that were positive for g-H2AX in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

imatinib-treated animals also showed an altered nuclear morphology, most importantly chromatin aggregation (Fig. 5B).
Overexpression of H2AX causes a transcriptional block that
sensitizes GIST cells to apoptosis. Given the chromatin
alterations detected in GISTs of imatinib-treated Kit V558D/+ mice,
we sought to determine whether H2AX overexpression directly
induces changes of chromatin structure. A morphologic analysis of
GIST882 cells transiently transfected with H2AX revealed phenotypical changes that mimicked the chromatin aggregation detected
in mice, whereas such alterations were absent in cells transfected
with an empty GFP vector (Fig. 6A). Quantification of the
proportion of cells with chromatin aggregation showed a significant
increase after 24 h from 0% in empty vector controls to 8.9% in
H2AX-expressing cells (P V 0.0001) and 6% in H2AX-S139A–
expressing cells (P V 0.05; Fig. 6B). After 48 h, a major increase of
cells with chromatin aggregation was detected from 0% in controls
to 28.8% in H2AX-expressing cells (P V 0.01), whereas the increase in
H2AX-S139A-expressing cells to 8.9% was less pronounced albeit
still significant in comparison to controls (P V 0.05).
Chromatin aggregation induced by excess histone has previously
been shown to abrogate transcription (28). We therefore determined whether increased H2AX levels could interfere with ongoing
transcription using a nuclear runoff assay. In vitro transcription
from a CMV immediate early promoter was carried out in the
presence of increasing amounts of recombinant H2AX protein. A
dose-dependent decrease of the 363-nucleotide runoff transcript
was detected when increasing amounts of H2AX were added to the
reaction (Fig. 6C). These findings clearly indicate that excess H2AX
can block ongoing gene transcription.
To directly analyze whether abrogation of gene transcription
stimulates apoptosis in GIST cells, we treated GIST882 cells with
a-amanitin, a specific inhibitor of RNA polymerase II (pol II). This

inhibitor has been suggested to interact with the largest subunit of
RNA pol II, Rpb1, to inhibit transcription initiation and elongation
of mRNAs (42). We found that a-amanitin selectively induced GIST
cell apoptosis, whereas it had no or little effect in IMR90 normal
human fibroblasts (Fig. 6D). Statistically highly significant increases
(P V 0.0001) of apoptotic GIST882 cells were detected after
48 h treatment with a-amanitin at all concentrations used ranging
from 0.1 to 5 Ag/mL in comparison to IMR90 cells. Remarkably,
0.5 and 1 Ag/mL a-amanitin led to 16.9% and 39.8% of apoptotic
GIST cells with virtually no toxicity in normal IMR90 fibroblasts
(0% and 0.35%, respectively; Fig. 6D). a-Amanitin was active in both
cell populations as evidenced by a reduced expression of the
initiating form of RNA pol II (Ser5 phosphorylated) by immunoblotting (data not shown).
Taken together, our results suggest that overexpression of soluble
histone H2AX sensitizes GIST cells to apoptosis by abrogating
ongoing gene transcription.

Discussion
Here, we show that the proapoptotic activity of imatinib in GIST
cells involves an up-regulation of soluble histone H2AX. Integrity of
the COOH-terminal SQE motif of H2AX is not strictly required but
may enhance this activity because mutant H2AX-S139A was less
efficient in triggering cell death than wild-type H2AX. We propose
a model in which excessive levels of free histone H2AX cause
chromatin aggregation, which leads to impaired transcription (28)
and thereby sensitizes tumor cells to undergo apoptosis. GIST
cells seem to be particularly sensitive to reduced RNA pol II
transcription as shown here (Fig. 6D) and in a recent study (43).
The fact that depletion of H2AX protein by siRNA did not
completely prevent imatinib-induced cell death (Fig. 3) may be
related to an incomplete protein knockdown. However, given that
KIT activates several downstream signaling pathways, it is possible
that more than one mechanism contributes to GIST cell death.
Imatinib has been reported to modulate proapoptotic signaling
pathways in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (44), and a recent

www.aacrjournals.org

study suggests that imatinib can cause death of nontumor cells by
inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress (45).
Our finding that GIST cells can down-regulate H2AX in a
pathway that involves PI3K, mTOR, and the ubiquitin/proteasome
machinery lends important support to the relevance of H2AX as
a tumor suppressor because it is, to the best of our knowledge,
the first demonstration of its dynamic regulation in human tumor
cells. Moreover, these results may have implications for a broad
range of tumors that carry PI3K mutations (46) and underscore the
importance of PI3K and mTOR as drug targets (6, 47).
There are several scenarios that may explain why tumor cells with
constitutively activated protein kinases down-regulate H2AX. The
continuous proliferative signal of an oncogenically activated kinase
is likely to trigger unscheduled S phase entry and, thus, an increased
stalling of replication forks (48, 49). This DNA replication stress
may result in a frequent uncoupling of H2AX synthesis from its
incorporation into nucleosomes (50). Results in yeast show that
these events lead to excess soluble histone proteins, which is
associated with a remarkable cellular toxicity (25). Because
accumulation of free H2AX stimulates apoptosis as shown in the
present study, its down-regulation would allow tumor cells to escape
from cell death. Moreover, given the role of H2AX as a critical nexus
between chromatin and DNA damage signaling cascades, an overall
reduction of H2AX levels in chromatin due to rapid degradation
and decreased incorporation into nucleosomes might represent an
efficient way to abrogate growth-inhibitory mechanisms associated
with DNA damage. This idea is consistent with the clinical
observation that tumors expressing activated tyrosine kinase
oncoproteins are frequently resistant to DNA damage-dependent
apoptosis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy or irradiation (51).
Our results have various implications for cancer therapy. First, the
observation that H2AX up-regulation is critical for GIST cell
sensitivity to imatinib suggests novel therapeutic approaches in
which H2AX induction might be accomplished by alternative
mechanisms, such as proteasome inhibition, thereby countering
imatinib resistance. Second, the observation that PI3K inhibition
leads to induction of H2AX expression provides a novel mechanistic

basis for antiapoptotic roles of PI3K and suggests that PI3K is a
promising therapeutic target in GIST, either combined with KIT
inhibition or alone (47). Third, our findings suggest that H2AX upregulation by tyrosine kinase oncoprotein inhibitors may restore
tumor sensitivity to conventional chemo- or radiotherapy.
Further understanding of how oncogenic protein kinases
overcome anticancer barriers during tumor evolution is likely to
improve the therapeutic and preventive use of targeted smallmolecule inhibitors.
