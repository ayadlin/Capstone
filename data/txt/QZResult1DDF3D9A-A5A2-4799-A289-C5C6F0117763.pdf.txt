ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs have been proved to participate in multiple biological processes in
cancers. For developing resistance to cytotoxic drug, cancer cells, especially the cancer
stem cells, usually change their microRNA expression profile to survive in hostile
environments. In the present study, we found that expression of microRNA-27a was
increased in colorectal cancer stem cells. High level of microRNA-27a was indicated to
induce the resistance to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Knockdown
of microRNA-27a resensitized colorectal cancer stem cells to TRAIL-induced cell
death. Mechanically, the gene of Apaf-1, which is associated with the mitochondrial
apoptosis, was demonstrated to be the target of microRNA-27a in colorectal cancer
stem cells. Knockdown of microRNA-27a increased the expression level of Apaf-1, thus
enhancing the formation of Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex and subsequently promoting
the TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer stem cells. These findings suggested
that knockdown of microRNA-27a in colorectal cancer stem cells by the specific
antioligonucleotides was potential to reverse the chemoresistance to TRAIL. It may
represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating the colorectal cancer more effectively.

INTRODUCTION

In TNF superfamily, the cytokine of TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is considered as
a potential anti-tumor agent. Treatment with TRAIL
effectively kills multiple cancer cells, such as hepatocellular
carcinoma cells and colorectal cancer [11, 12]. As TRAIL
induces significant apoptosis selectively in tumor cells
without influencing the function of normal cells, it has
been tested in clinical trials for treatment of various cancers
[13]. However, CSCs, which are the special population in
cancers, are reported to be resistant to TRAIL treatment
[14]. It is significant to overcome this obstacle in TRAIL
therapy by targeting the colorectal CSCs.
MicroRNAs are small and non-coding RNAs
exist in cells. They are endogenous and involved in
regulating the expression of human genes. MicroRNAs
induce degradation of targeting mRNA by pairing with
partially complementary sequence in the 3′-untranslated
region [15]. As microRNAs regulate about 60% of the
human genes, they participate in various biological
processes in cells [16, 17]. In cancer, microRNAs are often
dysregulated. Correcting the dysregulation of microRNAs

Colorectal cancer represents the third most
common cancer around the world [1]. Because of the liver
metastases in early stage, colorectal cancer is realized as
the “leading killer”, which has become a serious threat to
human life and health [2, 3]. For treatment of colorectal
cancer, chemotherapy is efficient initially. However, as
the continuous use of anti-tumor drugs, colorectal cancer
cells show lower response to them gradually [4]. Recently,
studies demonstrate that cancer stem cells (CSCs)
are responsible for drug-resistance in various cancers
[5–7], which emphasizes the significance of targeting
CSCs in cancer therapy. CSCs are highly self-renewing
and tumorigenic cells in tumor. They show obvious
chemoresistance and play key roles in chemotherapy failure
and cancer relapse [8, 9]. Previous studies have identified
that CD133 on cell surface is the marker of colorectal
CSCs [10]. It is urgent to explore the mechanism by which
colorectal CSCs develop their resistance to anti-tumor drugs
for improving the efficiency of cancer therapy.

has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation, metastasis,
survival and chemoresistance of cancers [18–20]. In the
present study, we found that expression of microRNA-27a
(miR-27a) was increased in colorectal CSCs rather than
their corresponding colorectal cells. Moreover, knockdown
of miR-27a was found to sensitize the colorectal CSCs
to TRAIL treatment. We aim to explore the molecular
mechanism of miR-27a antioligonucleotides on promoting
the TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colorectal CSCs.

RESULTS

of TRAIL to HT29 CSCs reduced 69.5% after they
were transfected with miR-27a antioligonucleotides
(Figure 2C). Similarly, IC50 of TRAIL to SW480 nonCSCs reduced 38.9%, and IC50 of TRAIL to SW480
CSCs reduced 64.0% after they were transfected with
miR-27a antioligonucleotides (Figure 2D). These results
indicated that colorectal CSCs were more sensitive to
miR-27a knockdown rather than the colorectal non-CSCs
when they were treated with TRAIL. We demonstrated
that miR-27a antioligonucleotides resensitized colorectal
cancer stem cells to TRAIL-induced cell death.

Expression level of miR-27a is increased in
colorectal cancer stem cells

MiR-27a antioligonucleotides enhance TRAILinduced apoptosis in colorectal cancer stem cells

To explore the role of miR-27a in colorectal cancer
stem cells, we separated the CSCs population from the
HT29 and SW480 cell lines by using the CD133 antibody.
As shown in Figure 1A, isolated HT29 and SW480
CSCs expressed high level of CD133. On contrary, the
expression of CD133 on the surface of HT29 and SW480
non-CSCs was low. Next, we investigated the expression
of miR-27a in HT29 and SW480 CSCs and non-CSCs. We
observed that miR-27a was overexpressed in colorectal
cancer cells rather than the normal colorectal cell line
FHC. Moreover, the population of CSCs in HT29 and
SW480 colorectal cells expressed significantly higher level
of miR-27a compared to their corresponding non-CSCs
population (Figure 1B). To validate the overexpression
of miR-27a in colorectal CSCs, we collected the CSCs
and non-CSCs from the colorectal cancer patients’ tumor
tissues. We found that colorectal CSCs showed strongly
higher level of miR-27a rather than their corresponding
non-CSCs (Figure 1C). Taken together, we demonstrated
the increased expression level of miR-27a in colorectal
cancer stem cells.

TRAIL is an anti-tumor drug which induces
apoptosis selectively in cancer cells [13]. To investigate
the role of miR-27a antioligonucleotides and TRAIL in
apoptosis pathway of colorectal CSCs, flow cytometry
analysis was performed. As shown in Figure 3A, although
miR-27a antioligonucleotides didn’t induce apoptosis
directly in HT29 and SW480 CSCs, it significantly
enhanced the TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Results of western
blot analysis showed that miR-27a antioligonucleotides
promoted the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3
obviously in colorectal CSCs (Figure 3B). Interestingly,
however, TRAIL-induced cleavage of caspase-8 was not
influenced by knockdown of miR-27a (Figure 3C). In
addition, transfection with miR-27a antioligonucleotides
didn’t change the release of cytochrome c in colorectal
CSCs treated with TRAIL (Figure 3D).

MiR-27a antioligonucleotides increase the
expression of Apaf-1 in colorectal cancer stem cells
To explore the mechanism by which miR-27a
antioligonucleotides facilitated TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in colorectal CSCs, we searched the target gene of miR27a on the public microRNA database of TargetScan
(http://www.targetscan.org/). Apoptotic protease activating
factor-1 (Apaf-1), which was identified as pro-apoptotic
gene [21], contained conservative 3′ UTR sequence at the
miR-27a binding site (Figure 4A). In addition, results of
western blot analysis showed that expression of Apaf-1
was decreased in colorectal CSCs compared to their
corresponding non-CSCs (Figure 4B and 4C). Because
of the negative correlation between the expression of
miR-27a and Apaf-1, we inferred that Apaf-1 gene was
the target of miR-27a in colorectal CSCs. Luciferase
assays revealed that miR-27a mimics suppressed reporter
gene activity in both HT29 CSCs and SW480 CSCs. On
contrary, miR-27a antioligonucleotides increased the
reporter gene activity in them (Figure 4D). Furthermore,
after transfection with miR-27a antioligonucleotides, the
protein level of Apaf-1 was significantly increased in
both HT29 and SW480 CSCs (Figure 4E). These results

MiR-27a antioligonucleotides sensitize colorectal
cancer stem cells to TRAIL
We observed that colorectal CSCs exhibited
significant resistance to TRAIL treatment. IC50 of
TRAIL to HT29 CSCs was 3.38 fold higher than the
HT29 non-CSCs, and IC50 of TRAIL to SW480 CSCs
was 1.93 fold higher than the SW480 non-CSCs (Figure
2A). The results indicated that colorectal CSCs showed
obvious resistance to TRAIL. As the miR-27a was found
to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer stem cells,
we knockdown the miR-27a by its specific antisense
oligonucleotides to investigate the relationship between
miR-27a and sensitivity to TRAIL in colorectal cancer
(transfection efficiency of miR-27a antioligonucleotides
was shown in Figure 2B.). We showed that both colorectal
CSCs and non-CSCs were sensitized to TRAIL by miR27a antioligonucleotides. However, we found that IC50
of TRAIL to HT29 non-CSCs reduced 39.4%, and IC50

of Apaf-1 was shown in Figure 5A. Results of cell
viability assays showed that transfection with miR-27a
antioligonucleotides significantly enhanced the anti-tumor
effect of TRAIL on HT29 and SW480 CSCs. However,
the activity of miR-27a antioligonucleotides was inhibited
by Apaf-1 siRNA. Knockdown of Apaf-1 abolished the
promotion of miR-27a antioligonucleotides on TRAILinduced cell death (Figure 5B). Similarly, although miR27a antioligonucleotides increased the apoptotic rate of
HT29 and SW480 CSCs under the treatment of TRAIL,
its activity was significantly suppressed by transfection
with Apaf-1 siRNA (Figure 5C). These results indicated
that miR-27a antioligonucleotides sensitized colorectal

To investigate whether miR-27a antioligonucleotides

the downstream of TRAIL/caspase-8 signaling, TRAIL
treatment induced collapse of mitochondrial membrane
potential (∆Ψm). However, transfection with MiR-27a
antioligonucleotides as well as Apaf-1 siRNA didn’t
change the effect of TRAIL on (∆Ψm) in colorectal CSCs
(Figure 6B). In addition, as the results of ∆Ψm decrease,
TRAIL but not the miR-27a antioligonucleotides and
Apaf-1 siRNA, induced release of cytochrome c in
HT29 and SW480 CSCs (Figure 6C). In the presence
of cytochrome c, Apaf-1 conjugated to pro-caspase-9
and triggered it [22]. To investigate the role of miR-27a
antioligonucleotides and TRAIL in the formation of
Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex, co-immunoprecipitation
assay was performed. We found that TRAIL treatment
induced interaction with Apaf-1 and caspase-9.

MiR-27a antioligonucleotides promote the
formation of Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex in
TRAIL-treated colorectal cancer stem cells
Caspase-8 is the substrate of TRAIL-death
receptor complex [21]. However, results of western
blot analysis showed that transfection with miR-27a
antioligonucleotides didn’t influence the activation of
caspase-8 induced by TRAIL. Besides, Apaf-1 siRNA,
which inhibited the overexpression of Apaf-1 induced
by miR-27a antioligonucleotides, had no effect on the
cleavage of caspase-8 in colorectal CSCs (Figure 6A). As

Furthermore, although miR-27a antioligonucleotides
single treatment didn’t induce the formation of Apaf-1caspase-9 complex, it significantly enhanced the effect of
TRAIL on formatting this complex. However, in case of
Apaf-1 was transfected into colorectal CSCs, interaction
with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 induced by combination with
miR-27a antioligonucleotides and TRAIL was inhibited
(Figure 6D). We therefore demonstrated that miR-27a
antioligonucleotides promoted the formation of Apaf1-caspase-9 complex by increasing the expression of
Apaf-1 in TRAIL-treated colorectal CSCs. In addition,

as the results of Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex formation,
caspase-9 and its substrate caspase-3 was cleaved
and activated [23]. Consistent with this, results of
western blot showed that miR-27a antioligonucleotides
significantly enhanced the TRAIL-induced activation
of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (Figure  6E), which
finally induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results
demonstrated that miR-27a antioligonucleotides
promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colorectal CSCs
by increasing the expression of Apaf-1, which conjugated
to caspase-9 and triggered it.

DISCUSSION

Subsequently, cleaved caspase-8 decreases the potential
of mitochondrial membrane and induces the formation of
mitochondrial membrane pore. Cytochrome c, which is
recognized as an apoptotic inducer, is then released into
cytoplasm from the damaged mitochondria [34–37]. In
the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, pro-caspase-9
is recruited to Apaf-1 to form the Apaf-1/caspase-9
apoptosome. As the results, caspase-9 and its substrate of
caspase-3 are activated, and finally, apoptosis occurs [38].
In the present study, we proved that miR-27a
antioligonucleotides resensitized colorectal cancer stem
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, miR-27a
antioligonucleotides treatment didn’t promote the
activation of caspase-8 and release of cytochrome
c in TRAIL-treated colorectal cancer stem cells.
Mechanically, our results demonstrated that miR-27a
antioligonucleotides increased the expression of Apaf-1
in TRAIL-treated colorectal cancer stem cells. Therefore,
miR-27a antioligonucleotides increased the level of Apaf1/caspase-9 apoptosome, which caused the activation
of caspase-9 and subsequent activation of caspase-3.
Schema of the mechanisms implicated in miR-27a
antioligonucleotides-sensitized apoptosis in TRAILtreated colorectal cancer stem cells is shown in Figure 7.
Drug-resistance is a major obstacle for clinical use
of TRAIL treatment [39]. Here, we provide evidences
that miR-27a antioligonucleotides sensitize colorectal
cancer stem cells to TRAIL by promoting the formation of
Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex. Knockdown of miR-27a may
represent a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming the
resistance of cancer stem cells to TRAIL.

As microRNAs are important regulators in multiple
cellular processes, cancer cells, especially the cancer stem
cells, usually change the expression profile of microRNAs
to survive and proliferate rapidly [24]. In addition, studies
have demonstrated that drug-resistance of CSCs is usually
induced by dysregulation of microRNAs. Correcting the
expression profile of microRNAs is reported to resensitize
the CSCs to treatment of anti-tumor drugs [25, 26].
MicroRNA-27a (miR-27a) has been reported
to function as an oncogene in multiple cancers.
Overexpression of miR-27a was found to markedly
promote cell proliferation, migration, invasion and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in different cancers
including colorectal cancer [27–30]. Furthermore, previous
researches demonstrated that increased expression of
miR-27a is involved in resistance to chemotherapy in
cancers [31, 32]. In this study, we demonstrate that miR27a is overexpressed in colorectal cancer, especially in
the CD133 positive stem-like cell population of colorectal
cancer (colorectal CSCs). Interestingly, although the
colorectal CSCs showed obvious resistance to TRAIL
treatment, knockdown of miR-27a by its specific
antioligonucleotides resensitized them to TRAIL.
TRAIL has been considered as a promising new
therapeutic drug for cancers, which induces death of
cancers by triggering apoptosis pathway [33]. After
administration with TRAIL, it binds to death receptors
4/5 (DR4/5) to form a death-inducing signaling complex
(DISC). DISC then recruits pro-caspase-8 and triggers it.

Figure 7: Schema of the mechanisms implicated in miR-27a antioligonucleotides-sensitized apoptosis in TRAIL-treated
colorectal CSCs. MiR-27a antioligonucleotides promote TRAIL-dependent formation of Apaf-1/caspase-9 complex by increasing the
expression of Apaf-1. As a result, caspase-9 is triggered, followed by activation of caspase-3 and occurrence of apoptosis finally.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RiboBio Co. Ltd. (China). Apaf-1 siRNA was purchased
from Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (USA). These RNAs (50
pmol/ml) were transient transfected into HT29 CSCs (nonCSCs) and SW480 CSCs (non-CSCs) by using lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s guidance.

Tissue samples
A total of 25 primary colorectal cancer tissues and
their corresponding non-tumor normal tissues were obtained
from patients who underwent tumor resection in Cancer
Hospital of China Medical University from 2/2014 to
10/2016. Tumor tissues were digested by using collagenase
type III (Worthington Biochemical, USA) to obtain the
single cell suspension. The tumor specimens used in the
present study were obtained with the approval of the ethics
committee of Cancer Hospital of China Medical University,
and all of the patients had given their informed consent.

Luciferase reporter assays
To verify the miR-27a-targeted mRNA, wildtype
3′ UTR of Apaf-1 mRNA (ENST00000333991) was
PCR-amplified and inserted into the pMIR-REPORT
luciferase reporter vector (Ambion, USA). Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (TaKaRa) was used to create the pMIRREPORT luciferase reporter contained mutant sequence
of Apaf-1 3′ UTR at the complementary binding site of
miR-27a. Luciferase reporter assays were performed by
using dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. pRLTK vector (Promega) which expresses Renilla luciferase)
was used as an internal control.

Cell lines
Colorectal cancer cells lines HT29 and SW480 were
originated from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
USA). Primary cultures of human normal colorectal cell
line FHC was purchased from ATCC. Cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen,
USA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS)
in a 37°C humidified chamber with 5% CO2.

Detection of cytochrome c release
To separate mitochondria from cytoplasm in
HT29 and SW480 CSCs, mitochondria/Cytosol Fraction
Kit (BioVision, USA) was used according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Protein levels of cytochrome c in
mitochondria and cytoplasm were detected to evaluate the
release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytoplasm.

Analysis of CD133 by ﬂow cytometry and cell
sorting
CD133-FITC antibody (BD Pharmingen, USA)
was used for identifying CSCs in colorectal cancer cells.
Briefly, single cell suspension obtained from primary
colorectal cancer patients, HT29 and SW480 cells were
incubated with CD133-FITC antibody on ice for 40 min
in the dark. After incubation, these cells were analyzed on
FACSAria (BectonDickinson Biosciences) ﬂow cytometer.
CD133 positive HT29 and SW480 cells were considered
as the colorectal CSCs for sorting.

Cell viability assays
Colorectal cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well overnight. Cells were then
transfected with RNA oligonucleotides and treated with
different concentrations of TRAIL subsequently. After
treatment, CCK-8 detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was
used to measure cell viability according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, 20 µl/well CCK-8 was added to the
medium and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The absorbance at
450 nm was measured by a microplate reader to determine
viable cells. Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of
TRAIL to colorectal cancer cells was calculated according to
the cell viability curves conducted by CCK-8 assays.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from cultured HT29 and
SW480 cells and colorectal cancer patients’ tumor tissues
by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). One Step
PrimeScript miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa, China)
was used to synthesize the cDNA for miR-27a. The qRTPCR reactions for miR-27a were performed by using the
SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) on Applied Biosystems
7500 Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems,
USA). The relative expression of miR-27a was normalized
by U6 snRNA expression.

Co-immunoprecipitation
Cells were harvested and incubated with lysis buffer
(Cell Signaling Technologies, USA) for 10 min on ice.
Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min
at 12,000 g to collect the supernatant. Protein lysates were
incubated with primary antibody of Apaf-1 (Cell Signaling
Technologies) overnight at 4°C, followed by followed
by addition of protein G agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C.
Immunoprecipitates were washed with cold lysis buffer
three times, and subsequently boiled with sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) sample buffer.

Transient transfection with RNAs
Negative control oligonucleotides (NCO), miR-27a
mimics, miR-27a antioligonucleotides were purchased from

Proteins were extracted from cells by using Cell
Signaling lysis buffer. Subsequently, the proteins were
boiled with SDS sample buffer and separated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE). The separated proteins were then transferred to
PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). After trarsmembrane,
membranes contained proteins were incubated with the
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After incubation
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology), signals were detected using
enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo, USA).

Detection of apoptosis
Cells were incubated with Annexin-V-FITC and
propidium iodide (PI) following the instruction of apoptosis
detecting kit (Invitrogen). Apoptosis of colorectal cancer
cells was detected on flow cytometry (BectonDickinson
Biosciences).

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane
potential (∆Ψm)
Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured
to evaluate the damage of mitochondria. Cells were
incubated with 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl
imidacarbo cyanine iodide (JC-1, Molecular Probes,
USA). Red fluorescence was emitted by JC-1 polymer in
healthy mitochondria and detected by flow cytometry.

Statistical analysis
All values were depicted as mean ± standard deviation
and carried out by three independent experiments. All data
were statistically analyzed by Student’s t-test or one-way
ANOVA with a Bonferroni correction using SPSS 15.0
software. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.
