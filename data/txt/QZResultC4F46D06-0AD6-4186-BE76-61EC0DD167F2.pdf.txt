Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer and successful treatment of metastatic melanoma remains challenging. BRAF/MEK
inhibitors only show a temporary beneﬁt due to rapid occurrence of resistance, whereas immunotherapy is mainly effective in
selected subsets of patients. Thus, there is a need to identify new targets to improve treatment of metastatic melanoma. To this
extent, we searched for markers that are elevated in melanoma and are under regulation of potentially druggable enzymes. Here,
we show that the pro-proliferative transcription factor FOXM1 is elevated and activated in malignant melanoma. FOXM1 activity
correlated with expression of the enzyme Pin1, which we found to be indicative of a poor prognosis. In functional experiments, Pin1
proved to be a main regulator of FOXM1 activity through MEK-dependent physical regulation during the cell cycle. The Pin1-FOXM1
interaction was enhanced by BRAFV600E, the driver oncogene in the majority of melanomas, and in extrapolation of the correlation
data, interference with\ Pin1 in BRAFV600E-driven metastatic melanoma cells impaired both FOXM1 activity and cell survival.
Importantly, cell-permeable Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides repressed the proliferation of melanoma cells in freshly isolated human
metastatic melanoma ex vivo and in three-dimensional-cultured patient-derived melanoids. When combined with the BRAFV600Einhibitor PLX4032 a robust repression in melanoid viability was obtained, establishing preclinical value of patient-derived melanoids
for prognostic use of drug sensitivity and further underscoring the beneﬁcial effect of Pin1-FOXM1 inhibitory peptides as antimelanoma drugs. These proof-of-concept results provide a starting point for development of therapeutic Pin1-FOXM1 inhibitors to
target metastatic melanoma.

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer with an
average survival rate of 8–18 months when untreated.1,2 Treatment options mainly consist of immunotherapy, or targeted
therapies against activated oncogenic pathways, both of which
have limitations. Immunotherapy does provide a prolonged
clinical response, but is mainly effective in a subset of patients.3
Targeted therapies are generally designed around inhibition of the
pro-proliferative kinase MEK. MEK is constitutively activated in the
vast majority of all melanomas due to activating mutations in the
upstream kinases BRAF or NRAS, with V600E-mutated BRAF being
the oncogenic driver of ~ 50% of all melanomas.4 Repression of
mutated BRAF or MEK proved to strongly reduce the growth of
several melanomas.5,6 Indeed, small molecule inhibitors against
mutant BRAF such as Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib provide a
potent initial clinical beneﬁt and delay, but not prevent, patient
mortality.7,8 Unfortunately, additional mutations in the same or
parallel pathways occur rapidly, keeping MEK activity high and the
overall survival rate low.9
To improve patient survival, new therapies would either have to
enhance initial drug efﬁcacy, repress acquired drug resistance or
inhibit downstream targets of MEK in an alternative manner.
1

We focused on the latter approach by searching for new
druggable weak spots in malignant melanoma.
RESULTS
FOXM1 is elevated and active in melanomas
We initiated this study by performing a database analysis to
identify pro-proliferative and pro-survival factors that are elevated
in melanoma. MEK is chronically activated in the majority of
melanomas, and MEK activation is a prime cause of resistance to
BRAF inhibitors.10 Therefore, we focused on factors that are under
potential regulation of MEK signaling as we reasoned these could
be potential candidates for therapeutic intervention of melanomas resistant to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We used Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis on gene expression proﬁles from independent data sets
to identify molecular pathways that are activated in melanoma
compared with normal skin. One hit that was both projected to be
active by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and was also elevated in
melanoma was FOXM1 (Figure 1a), a MEK target.11 We found
FOXM1 to correlate with progressive disease status (Figure 1b),
suggesting FOXM1 may be relevant to melanoma development.
FOXM1 is a transcription factor that is expressed and activated
during active cell cycle progression,12 further underscoring

a potential role in tumor progression, and FOXM1 has been
implicated in the chemoresistance of other types of cancer.13,14
We thus set out to study whether FOXM1 could be a suitable
target of intervention against melanoma.
First, we analyzed whether the increase in FOXM1 expression in
melanomas could be due to gene ampliﬁcation. In contrast to
CDKN2A, which is known to be lost in many melanomas,15 we did
not observe signiﬁcant changes in FOXM1 gene copy number
(Figure 1c), suggesting the FOXM1 increase may be due to
elevated transcription.
FOXM1 is known to regulate its own transcription in a feedforward fashion.16,17 As FOXM1 activation could therefore be
responsible for elevations in its messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, we next searched for genes correlating with FOXM1
expression. We speciﬁcally focused on enzymes, reasoning that
they might be upstream regulators of FOXM1 activity and hence
candidates for therapeutic intervention. Co-expression analysis of
two independent melanoma data sets revealed several potential

enzymatic regulators of FOXM1. One enzyme, which convincingly
appeared in both data sets, was Pin1 (Figure 1d).
Pin1-FOXM1 signaling is elevated in metastatic melanoma and
indicative of poor disease outcome
Pin1 is a phospho-speciﬁc peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that induces a
cis-to-trans conversion of peptide backbones,18 thereby exposing
covered residues and allowing additional regulation of substrate
activity.19 Pin1 facilitates substrate isomerization through interaction with phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. During cell cycle
progression, FOXM1 is progressively phosphorylated on such
motifs.20 We therefore expanded our database search by
analyzing whether, in addition to FOXM1 gene expression, Pin1
correlates with FOXM1 activity in melanoma. CENPF and Cyclin B1
are two important FOXM1 targets that mediate the mitosisregulatory effects of FOXM1.20,21 Furthermore, FOXM1 and CENPF
were recently shown to have a synergistic interaction that drives

cancer malignancy.22 Therefore, we used CENPF and Cyclin B1 as
markers for FOXM1 activity. Individual melanomas from independent data sets showed that FOXM1, CENPF and Cyclin B1, but not
actin (control), signiﬁcantly correlated with Pin1 expression
(Figures 2a and b). Patients bearing tumors expressing high levels
of Pin1, FOXM1, CENPF and Cyclin B1 showed a markedly higher
mortality rate (Figure 2c), suggesting these markers may be
applicable as a prognostic tool for disease outcome.
To determine whether the increased mRNA levels result in
increased protein expression, we stained samples from a
BRAFV600E-inducible mouse model that spontaneously develops
melanomas,23 for Pin1 and FOXM1. Whereas the BRAFV600Einduced nevus showed only background staining for Pin1 and
FoxM1, both were strongly elevated in a BRAFV600E-derived
melanoma (Supplementary Figure A). We obtained the best
staining on mouse tissues using two rabbit-derived antibodies
against Pin1 and CENPF. Instead of performing co-staining, we
therefore stained sequential sections of a nevus and a derived
tumor. Although the nevus again only revealed background levels
of Pin1 expression, Pin1 was elevated in the adjacent melanoma.
Importantly, CENPF expression was elevated in the same area,
indicating that in the Pin1-positive melanoma FOXM1 signaling is
active (Figures 2d and e). Subsequently, we determined to what
extent these results hold true in humans, by using a patientderived skin and melanoma sample in which we were able to
perform direct co-staining using a mouse-Pin1 antibody. Although
the normal skin control failed to show signiﬁcant staining of Pin1
and CENPF, these were both elevated the melanoma, as seen in
the mouse situation and they strongly co-expressed within the
same cells (Figure 2f and Supplementary Figure B). A separate
staining for Cyclin B1 also revealed this FOXM1 target to be
elevated (Figure 2f). Thus, Pin1 correlates both with FOXM1
expression itself and FOXM1 activity in melanoma and high Pin1FOXM1 levels suggest a poor prognosis.
Pin1 is essential for FOXM1 activity
Our correlation data raised the possibility that FOXM1 signaling is
under direct control of Pin1. To address this, we determined
whether Pin1 regulates FOXM1 activity. As both proteins are active
during normal cell cycle progression, we ﬁrst addressed whether
Pin1 regulates FOXM1 under those conditions. FOXM1 expression
is minimal in non-proliferating cells.20 On cell cycle initiation,
FOXM1 is gradually stabilized and its transcriptional activity
increases. This results in a peak in FOXM1 expression and
activation during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, followed by
rapid degradation on mitotic exit. To determine whether Pin1
regulates FOXM1 activity during cell cycle progression, we
induced cell cycle arrest by growth factor withdrawal in wildtype or Pin1−/− mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) and subsequently followed how growth factor-induced cell cycle initiation
affected the expression of FoxM1 and CENPF. FoxM1 and CENPF
expression increased over the ensuing 24 h in wild-type MEFs as
expected, but only marginally increased in Pin1−/− MEFs
(Figure 3a). Single-cell analysis conﬁrmed that under proliferative
conditions, FoxM1 is present in wild-type, but only marginally in
Pin1−/− MEFs (Figure 3b).
To further address the importance of Pin1 for FOXM1 activity,
we next used an established cell line that stably expresses a
chimeric FOXM1 protein fused to the ligand-binding domain of
the estrogen receptor (ER).20 The resulting FOXM1-ER is inactive
until stabilized by 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for target gene
expression. Indeed, 4-hydroxytamoxifen signiﬁcantly elevated the
expression of FOXM1-ER and its target genes Cyclin B1 and CENPF
(Figure 3c). Strikingly, Pin1 depletion by RNA interference
abrogated 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced expression of CENPF
and Cyclin B1. Consistent with the results obtained using
Pin1−/− MEFs, this indicates that Pin1 is essential for FOXM1

activity and supports a causal link between elevated Pin1 and
FOXM1 activity in the melanoma samples of Figure 2.
Pin1 regulates FOXM1 through MEK-dependent physical
interaction
During cell cycle progression, FOXM1 is gradually phosphorylated
on multiple residues, including the Ser-Pro motifs S331 and
S704.11 Phosphorylation of these residues was shown to be MEKdependent, but it remains unaddressed whether this is mediated
by MEK itself or its target ERK1/2. We observed recombinant ERK1
to be able to phosphorylate FOXM1 in vitro, suggesting S331 and
S704 are ERK target sites, phosphorylated in a MEK-dependent
manner (Supplementary Figure C).
Interference with MEK activity or mutation of the MEK/ERK
target sites impairs the ability of FOXM1 to transactivate target
genes and entry into mitosis.11 As Ser/Thr-Pro sites are potential
Pin1-docking sites, we asked whether Pin1 can physically interact
with FOXM1. Before addressing this for endogenous proteins, we
ﬁrst performed interaction assays using ectopically expressed
epitope-tagged proteins. Under basal conditions, FOXM1 and Pin1
could be reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated (Figure 4a). Ectopically expressed FOXM1 could furthermore be pulled down using
bacterially produced, recombinant Glutathion-S-Transferase (GST)tagged Pin1, suggesting a direct interaction (Supplementary
Figure D).
Pin1 interacts with substrates through recognition of phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs by its WW-domain.18 To better
understand the nature of the Pin1-FOXM1 interaction, we asked
whether FOXM1 phosphorylation is required. Mutation of the
critical Pin1 phospho-binding residue W34 abrogated the interaction (Supplementary Figure D). Moreover, post-lysis dephosphorylation of FOXM1 by λ-phosphatase attenuated its interaction
with recombinant GST-Pin1 (Supplementary Figure E). These data
identify FOXM1 as a phospho-speciﬁc substrate of Pin1.
Next, we addressed under which physiological conditions Pin1
interacts with FOXM1. FOXM1 is phosphorylated by MEK/ERK at
the G2/M transition of the cell cycle to facilitate mitotic entry and
execution.11 To determine whether MEK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation of FOXM1 at this cell cycle stage is required for its
regulation by Pin1, we exposed the cells to Nocodazole, which
arrests cells in G2/M by impairing the microtubule polymerization
required for mitotic entry.20 FOXM1 extracted from G2/M-arrested
cells was a signiﬁcantly stronger interaction partner for GST-Pin1
than FOXM1 extracted from asynchronous cells (Figure 4b).
Importantly, this effect was lost upon chemical inhibition of MEK
(Figure 4c), indicating that MEK-mediated phosphorylation at the
G2/M boundary primes FOXM1 for Pin1 binding. In addition, we
generated a FOXM1 mutant in which both MEK-target sites Ser331
and Ser704 are mutated to Alanine, FOXM1S331/704A. In contrast to
wild-type FOXM1, recombinant GST-Pin1 failed to precipitate this
mutant (Figure 4d). Thus, Pin1 binds FOXM1 on its MEK/ERK target
sites at the G2/M boundary of the cell cycle.
As MEK is frequently hyperactivated in melanomas due to
oncogenic BRAF signaling, we also determined the effect of
oncogenic BRAF on Pin1-FOXM1 binding. Interestingly, BRAFV600E
signiﬁcantly increased the interaction in a fashion that was
abrogated on chemical MEK inhibition (Figure 4e). Altogether,
these experiments indicate that (I) Pin1 correlates with FOXM1
expression and activity in malignant melanoma, (II) Pin is causally
linked to FOXM1 activity through physical binding on MEK/ERK
target sites and (III) oncogenic BRAF stimulates the Pin1-FOXM1
interaction through MEK. This led us to address whether Pin1FOXM1 signaling can be exploited for therapeutic intervention of
BRAFV600E-driven melanomas.

Pin1 inhibition represses FOXM1 activity and growth of metastatic
BRAFV600E-driven melanoma cells
To investigate the importance of the elevated Pin1-FOXM1
signaling in melanoma, we searched for a representative cell line
that recapitulates these elevations. Compared with neonatal human
epidermal melanocytes, BRAFV600E-mutated Colo829 human melanoma cells showed enhanced expression of Pin1, FOXM1, CENPF
and Cyclin B1 both at the mRNA and protein levels (Figures 5a and
b). Similar to the human and mouse melanoma samples (Figures 2d
and f) and the MEF samples (Figure 3b), Pin1 and CENPF coexpressed in individual Colo829 cells (Figure 5c). Also, endogenous
Pin1 and FOXM1 co-immunoprecipitated in lysates from these cells
(Figure 5d), indicating an endogenous Pin1-FOXM1 interaction.

To determine the role of endogenous Pin1-FOXM1 signaling in
melanoma cells, we ﬁrst depleted FOXM1. This resulted in a
marked decrease in colony-forming potential (Supplementary
Figure F), indicating that FOXM1 is important for the proliferative
potential of Colo829. We also transiently repressed Pin1 expression
in these cells (Figure 5e). Consistent with our results in the Pin1−/−
MEFs and ER-FOXM1-overexpressing cells (Figures 3a and c), Pin1
inhibition reduced the expression of endogenous FOXM1, CENPF
and Cyclin B1 in Colo829 (Figure 5e). As Pin1 depletion might
arguably suppress cell cycle progression, which regulates FOXM1
activity, we determined the effect of Pin1 depletion on FOXM1
activity in Colo829 cells arrested in G1/S by Thymidine or G2/M by
Nocodazole.20 CENPF expression was detectable in G2/M arrested,

but not G1/S arrested, cells (Supplementary Figure G), showing
that, although being highly expressed under basal conditions,
CENPF expression in Colo829 is still cell cycle-dependent. Notably,
although transient knockdown of Pin1 did not affect the amount
of G2/M-arrested Colo829 cells by Nocodazole, it strongly reduced
CENPF expression. The effects of Pin1 inhibition on reduced
FOXM1 activity are therefore independent of potential changes in
cell cycle progression caused by Pin1 depletion. Encouraged by
these results, we wondered what would be the effect of Pin1
inhibition on the malignant proliferation of these cells. As small
interfering RNA is only effective for short periods of time, we
applied stable knockdown of Pin1 using lentiviral small hairpin
RNAs. Strikingly, prolonged repression of Pin1 markedly decreased
the colony-forming potential of Colo829 (Figure 5f). Together
these ﬁndings suggest that interference with the Pin1-FOXM1
interaction can be effective against melanoma progression.
Cell-permeable Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides repress FOXM1
activity and melanoma cell viability
To investigate whether the Pin1-FOXM1 interaction could be
targeted for therapeutic use, we developed a set of peptides
designed to interfere with the Pin1-FOXM1 interaction. These
peptides mimic the sequences in FOXM1 neighboring the Pin1binding sites S331 and S704 deﬁned in Figure 4d. We rendered
the peptides cell-permeable by fusion to the HIV TAT sequence24
(Figure 6a). Treatment of Colo829 with the S331/704 peptides
resulted in decrease in the endogenous Pin1-FOXM1 interaction
(Figure 6b), indicating that targeting the Pin1-FOXM1 interaction
in melanoma cells is feasible.
Next, we investigated the effect of these peptides on FOXM1
activity and the concomitant malignant proliferation. Incubation
of Colo829 with the Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides decreased
CENPF expression (Figure 6c), indicating decreased FOXM1
activity. In turn, the Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides reduced the
percentage of viable Colo829 melanoma cells but not normal

melanocytes (Figure 6d). These results suggest that inhibition of
the Pin1-FOXM1 interaction may be applicable against human
melanoma and provided a stepping stone for testing the efﬁcacy
of these peptides in a more physiologically relevant setting using
fresh patient-derived material.
Direct Pin1-FOXM1 inhibition represses metastatic tumor
progression in patient-derived melanoma slices ex vivo and
melanoma cell viability in 3D-cultured melanoids
As cell lines have typically been in culture for prolonged periods of
time, they have become adapted to tissue culture conditions and
differ from the original situation in human patients. We therefore
sought alternative models that better recapitulate this setting to
test the efﬁcacy of our Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides. Unfortunately, sequence alignment of human and mouse FOXM1 around
the sequence of our peptides showed the S704 to poorly align
with mouse FOXM1 (Supplementary Figure H), arguing against
their use in experiments in spontaneous BRAFV600E-induced
melanoma in mice such as the model described in Figures 2d and e.
To overcome these limitations, we therefore used two independent techniques using fresh patient material, the ﬁrst based on
ex vivo culture of melanoma metastases and the second on
three-dimensional (3D)-cultured melanoma organoids, here
dubbed melanoids.
For ex vivo melanoma metastasis culture, a stage IV metastatic
melanoma was sectioned in 300 μM thin slices, which were
individually placed in culture media (Figure 7a), similar to what we
previously showed for mammary carcinoma.25 The slices were
subdivided for either vehicle treatment or incubation with the
Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides. After 6 days the proliferative
potential of the cells inside the tumor material was determined by
measuring nuclear CENPF positivity and 24 h EdU incorporation.
Excitingly, both CENPF staining and EdU incorporation were
markedly reduced in the melanoma sections incubated with the
Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides (Figures 7b and c). In line with the

(a–c) The S331/704 peptides repress CENPF expression and malignant proliferation of a human metastatic melanoma biopsy. A melanoma was

were split into in 96-well plates and exposed to 0.25 μM PLX4032, 100 μM of the S704 DRI peptide or their combination. Cell viability

results showing that Pin1 regulates FOXM1 levels in culture
(Figures 3a and 5e) also FOXM1 expression was repressed in these
sections (Supplementary Figure I). Encouraged by these results, we
sought to further extrapolate these data. A major beneﬁt of
melanoma tumor slice culture is these largely preserve the
complexity and tumor-stromal interactions of the original tumor.
A downside, however, is that they only allow for few conditions to
be examined before the material is exhausted. To overcome this
limitation, we therefore used part of the material for 3D organoid
cultures, allowing for additional experiments to be performed on
near-primary material of the same patients. To this extent we
placed separate metastatic tumor sections in matrigel and allowed
tumor outgrowth to occur. After removal of the primary tumor slice,
clean melanoma cultures were obtained through multiple rounds of
passaging to remove contamination of ﬁbroblasts and other cell
types (Figure 7d). Thus, we were able to use these cultures to test
the effects of Pin1-FOXM1 inhibition on tumor growth.
So far, we used a combination of two independent peptides.
Clinical translation of such a combination of two drugs is
challenging as each will have to be separately tested for offtarget effects. In our earlier experiments, we observed the S704
peptide, but not the S331 peptide, to show partial anti-melanoma
activity on its own (not shown). To overcome this limitation of
having to use a combination of peptides, we therefore sought to
optimize the S704 peptide for use as single agent. To this extent,
we designed a D-Retro-Inverso (DRI) version of the S704 peptide,
which is potentially more effective, as was observed for other cellpermeable peptides.26 First, we tested the FOXM1-S704 DRI
peptide on 3D melanoid cultures using two independent
BRAFV600E-mutated cell lines, Colo829 and Malme-3M, both of
which are sensitive to the BRAFV600E-inibitor PLX4032 (Vemurafenib; Supplementary Figure J). A single dose of this peptide
reduced
Colo829
and
Malme-3M
melanoid
viability
(Supplementary Figure J), prompting us to determine the effects
of the peptide on melanoids grown straight from patient-derived
material. To this extent, we generated a melanoid culture to
faithfully mimic the majority of metastatic melanomas as
described in Figures 1 and 2, ErasmusMC Melanoma #5 (EM5).
EM5 was isolated from a stage III lymph node-resected metastatic
melanoma that was TP53 wild type, BRAFV600E-mutated and
CDKN2 A-deﬁcient (Figure 7d and Supplementary Figure K),
thereby passing these criteria. More potently than in the
established cell lines, FOXM1-S704 DRI reduced the number of
viable cells of this 3D melanoid culture (Figure 7d). As BRAF
inhibition is potent against metastatic melanoma, but allows for
recurrence in time, we ultimately set out to determine to what
extent this peptide could be complementary to the clinically
frequently prescribed BRAFV600E-inhibitor PLX4032, Vemurafenib.
Excitingly, whereas both PLX4032 and the FOXM1-S704 DRI
peptide individually reduced EM5 melanoid viability, their
combination decreased viability to levels below background,
indicating that FOXM1-S704 can be additive to BRAF inhibition
against human melanoma (Figure 7e).
Together, these independent ex vivo assays, using fresh patientderived metastatic melanoma slices or 3D melanoids, show that
direct inhibition of the Pin1-FOXM1 interaction can be used to
repress FOXM1 activity and malignant melanoma proliferation, the
latter of which is applicable to complement BRAF inhibition. These
results provide a starting point for further optimization and may
open opportunities for therapeutic intervention, in particular, of
high FOXM1-expressing metastatic melanomas.
DISCUSSION
To target metastatic melanoma, inhibitors of the RAF/MEK
pathway have shown partial clinical success,7,8 but their effectiveness is hampered due to development of resistance.27 To improve
the prognosis for melanoma patients, efforts now focus on either
Oncogene (2016) 2166 – 2177

intermittent treatment schedules for existing drugs,28 development of new RAF/MEK inhibitors,29,30 sequential treatment of
resistant tumors31 or combination therapies.27,32 Much less
attention has been devoted to targeting proteins that function
downstream of MEK and promote cell survival or cell cycle
progression. These potentially provide an uncharted ﬁeld of
targetable opportunities.
Here, we showed that many human melanomas express
elevated levels of the pro-proliferative and pro-survival MEKtarget FOXM1. Inhibition of its enzymatic regulator Pin1 or the
Pin1-FOXM1 interaction successfully repressed FOXM1 activity and
tumor proliferation ex vivo of in a freshly cultured human
melanoma tumor and in 3D-cultured patient-derived melanoids
(Figure 7). It should be noted that the effects in 3D were more
robust than in 2D and more efﬁcient in fresh patient-derived
samples than in established cell lines. Potentially cell–cell
interactions and cell–matrix interactions are therefore important
to take into account. FOXM1 has been associated with epithelialto-mesenchymal transition, E-Cadherin expression, migration and
secretion of inﬂammatory proteins (for example, reviewed in33 all
of which are more important in 3D, hence patients, than in 2D.
We also addressed apoptosis in 2D, but this did not appear to be
strongly affected by the FOXM1 peptides. Regardless of the cause,
these results provide a proof-of-concept that Pin1-FOXM1blocking peptides are functional against melanoma progression
in a physiological setting ex vivo and are a therefore potentially
applicable therapeutic tool to complement BRAF/MEK inhibitors to
clinically target metastatic melanoma (Figure 7e). It will be
interesting to see if further optimization of the peptides is
possible by using additional modes of delivery, altered sequences
or longer stretches of the peptide and whether these are
applicable against BRAF/inhibitor-resistant tumor from patients.
In this study, we speciﬁcally focused on the role of Pin1-FOXM1
signaling in melanoma. It is tempting to speculate that FOXM1
inhibition might be beneﬁcial to cancers other than melanoma.
FOXM1 is not only elevated in melanoma, but also in other types
of cancer (Supplementary Figure M). However, Pin1 expression
does not appear to signiﬁcantly correlate with FOXM1, CENPF
and Cyclin B1 expression in at least mammary, ovarian, renal and
endometrial carcinomas and glioblastoma (Supplementary Figure N),
suggesting the regulation of FOXM1 activity by Pin1 might be
restricted to subsets of cancers.
BRAFV600E is not only active in melanoma, but also in benign
nevi. In nevi, however, the CDK4/6 inhibitor p16ink4a induces
senescence and a strong G1/S arrest, which would restrain FOXM1
expression and its phosphorylation by MEK. Indeed, we observed
low FOXM1 expression in nevi (Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure A).
p16ink4a is frequently lost in melanoma due to genetic ablation15
(Figure 1c), which would allow FOXM1 expression. FOXM1 recently
gained interest as a target of the CDK4/6 complex that is inhibited
by p16ink4a.34 Thus, it is possible that, due to the defective
repression of CDK4/6 in p16ink4a-mutated cells, FOXM1 is initially
stabilized by this complex, allowing the subsequent MEKdependent phosphorylation and the recognition by Pin1 we
observed here. Interestingly, FOXM1 has been identiﬁed in
hepatocellular carcinoma as a target of Alternate Reading Frame
of the INK4a/ARF locus (CDKN2A), which also encodes p16ink4a.35
Arg-loaded peptides designed to interfere with ARF activity
showed to reduce FOXM1 expression. In melanomas, including
the cell line used here, however, expression of the CDKN2A locus
is frequently lost (see Figure 1c).15 This still results in excessive
expression of FOXM1 in melanomas (Figures 2a and f) and the
here used CDKN2A-deﬁcient cells (Figures 5a and c), indicating
that ARF1 expression is not critical to FOXM1 expression in
CDKN2A-depleted melanomas and FOXM1 inhibition cannot be
targeted this way. It may be interesting to determine whether the
Pin1-FOXM1 interaction can be perturbed by CDK4/6 inhibitors
such as PD033299134 leading to FOXM1 destabilization. The Pin1© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited

FOXM1 inhibitory peptides we designed in this study (Figure 6a
and Figure 7d) do show inhibitory potential toward FOXM1
activity and strongly repress tumor growth in a human melanoma
ex vivo and 3D-cultured melanoids, complimentary to PLX4032
and as single entities.
To study new anticancer therapies, cell lines are a frequent
starting point because they allow many experimental conditions
to be inexpensively and rapidly tested. It remains challenging,
however, to recapitulate the complexity of tumors and interactions between malignant cells and stroma in culture. Mice can
overcome this limitation, but present their own challenges.
Faithfully mimicking natural development of melanoma in mice
is still an ongoing task as there are notable differences in
melanoma development in humans and mice and mice generally
express less cutaneous melanocytes.36,37 Recent advances have
been made in generating inducible BRAFV600E mice either in
combination with PTEN loss.38,39 Targeting proteins in mice,
however, requires a high degree of sequence homology, which is
sometimes absent. Also in case of our Pin1-FOXM1-targeting
peptides the ability of targeting endogenous FOXM1 in mice is
low due to imperfect sequence similarity (Supplementary Figure H).
To overcome this limitation, we used two independent systems
using fresh patient-derived material instead, melanoma slice
culture and 3D melanoids. Melanoma slice culture allows multiple
experimental conditions to be tested on material from a single
patient, yet to a degree maintains the complexity and microenvironment of the original human tumor. Outcomes from
experiments performed on such ex vivo cultured metastasis
material may provide a direct functional answer on whether a
treatment is likely to succeed in that patient without having to
perform mouse xenografts studies or pharmacogenomics.
As metastases generally share a degree of genetic similarity,
results from experiments on ex vivo cultured material from a
metastatic cancer patient could potentially also be translated to
additional metastases in the same patient, thus providing a
powerful tool for the development of patient-speciﬁc therapies.
The 3D melanoids could also be used for prognostic use of drug
sensitivity, but have an added beneﬁt that they can be maintained
for longer periods of time. Though typically ignored, results in 2D
can differ from 3D. Though the FOXM1 peptide(s) did show certain
effects in long cultured cell lines in 2D, the effects in primary tissue
—either in slice culture or in melanoids, were more potent and
more reproducible. Thus, initial experiments on simple individual
melanoma slice cultures or 3D melanoids from a metastatic
patient may predict whether that individual could beneﬁt from
Pin1-FOXM1 inhibitory therapy. At least a subset of melanoma
patients display elevated Pin1-FOXM1 signaling (Figure 2a) in
combination with a poor prognosis and for these patients Pin1FOXM1-blocking peptides may be a new treatment option, either
alone or in combination with RAF/MEK inhibitors (see Figure 7).

the Netherlands). Of note, when obtained fresh from the supplier (ATCC),
the Colo829 cells contain many non-dividing senescent cells. We obtained the
best results using Colo829 populations in the early log phase of proliferation.
Similar effects hold true for Malme-3M (NCI, Rockville, MD, USA).

Quantitative real-time PCR
To detect mRNA expression, mRNA of three independent samples was
extracted using the Cells-to-Ct kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Quantitative
PCR was subsequently performed using the Universal Probe Library system
(Roche, Branchburg, NJ, USA) with the following primer/probe combinations: CENPF-UPL74–forward: 5′-gagtcctccaaaccaacagc-3′, CENPF-UPL74–
reverse: 5′-tccgctgagcaactttgac-3′, FOXM1-UPL11–forward: 5′-actttaagcacatt

ATCAA-3′ (shPin1-2) from Open Biosystems. pLK0.1-shGFP containing the
mature sequence 5′-GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCAT-3′ was used as a control.

Colony formation assay, AqueousOne Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay and TUNEL staining
Colo829 cells were stably transduced with the indicated lentiviral particles.
The next day the media was refreshed and 2 days later again with media
containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Three days later, cells were refreshed once
without puromycin. Twenty-four hours later equal numbers of cells were
plated in triplicate in six-well plates for each condition. Seven days later,
the cells were ﬁxed in MeOH and visualized after staining with 1% crystal
violet in 25% MeOH. In case of the S331/704 peptides, cells were similarly
ﬁxed and processed at 7 days after incubation with 50 μM of the mix. The
CellTiter96 AqueousOne Solution Cell Proliferation Assay was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega) in a 96-well plate
containing Colo829 cells treated on day 1 and 3 with 50 μM of the S331/704
peptide mix and measured at day 5. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling staining was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Roche).

Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides
Cell-permeable peptides designed to interfere with the Pin1-FOXM1
interaction were obtained from NeoBioSci and comprised the following
sequences (see Figure 6a):
FOXM1-S331: GRKKRRQRRRPPTLDQVFKPLDPGSPQLPEHLESQQKR (S331
underscored) and FOXM1-S704: GRKKRRQRRRPPDLISVPFGNSSPSDIDVPKPG
SPEPQVSGLAA (S704 underscored). The FOXM1-S704 DRI peptide has an
identical amino-acid sequence as the regular S704 peptide, but in a DRI isoform
and was ordered at 490% purity from PepScan (Lelystad, the Netherlands).

Melanoma biopsy isolation and treatment
Informed consent was obtained for use of the tumor sample in this study.
The human melanoma was excised and placed in a 50-ml conical tube
containing Dulbecco's modiﬁed eagle medium 10% FCS. Subsequently,
it was sliced in 300-μM sections using a Vibratome (Leica, Eindhoven,
the Netherlands). The sections were maintained under gentle rocking
(60 rpm) in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modiﬁed
eagle medium 10% FCS. The biopsy sections were incubated with FOXM1blocking peptides and 5 days later incubated with EdU. One day later, they
were ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence detection of CENPF or
cytochemical detection of EdU according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands).

3D-cultured melanoma cell line and patient-derived organoids
(melanoids)
For 3D-cultured patient-derived melanoids, a previously untreated stage III
human metastatic melanomas was resected from a lymph node and
processed for biopsy culture as described above. Subsequently, sections
were placed in Matrigel (Corning) in a 24-well plate and allowed to gellify
for 5 min at 37 °C after which they were incubated with Dulbecco's
modiﬁed eagle medium 10% FCS, Pen/Strep. Tumor cell outgrowth was
allowed to occur and the primary tumor section was removed. After
expansion, the melanoids were passaged through resuspension with a
Pasteur pipet, followed by mild centrifugation in 15-ml tubes. Subsequently, the tubes were cooled and ice-thawed Matrigel (Corning) was
added followed by plating in 24-well plates. This was continued for several
rounds to eliminate non-melanoma cells. Next-generation sequencing as
described,42 using a selected panel (Clo-TUM) of whole-gene mutation
analysis, hotspot analysis and single-nucleotide polymorphisms analysis,
showed BRAFV600E-mutation and CDKN2A mutation in 496% of the
population, conﬁrming the purity of the culture. For the experiments in
Figures 7d and e, the resuspended melanoids were plated in 96-well
plates, allowed to gellify and supplemented with growth media
(Dulbecco's modiﬁed eagle medium, 10% FCS, Pen/Strep). The next day
the melanoids were plated in quadruplo and incubated with the FOXM1
DRI and/or PLX4032 as indicated and cell viability was determined 36 days
later using AqueousOne Celltiter assay (Promega).
For 3D-culture of established human melanoma cell lines, 1000 cells
were placed in matrigel and allowed to form spheres in 24-well plates.
When sufﬁciently grown, these were split in triplicate into 96-well plates in
fresh Matrigel (2 µl/well). Following treatment with the FOXM1 DRI peptide
or PLX4032 as indicated, cell viability was determined as above.

Sequence alignments
To compare human and mouse FOXM1, the following sequences from
National Center for Biotechnology Information were used: Human FOXM1:
NP_973731, Mouse FOXM1: NP_032047.4.

Statistical analysis of database studies
The data from study 1–6 were obtained from the Oncomine database:
www.oncomine.org. For Figure 1a, the data from studies (43) and (44) were
analyzed for differential expression of melanoma vs using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis; Version build 242990. Shown are those factors that have
a predicted activation Z-score42, are themselves upregulated more than
twofold and are signiﬁcantly different between skin and melanoma
(P-valueo0.05; Student’s t-test). For Figures 1b, a differential expression
analysis comparing melanomas isolated from primary sites to metastases
was performed on the data from studies (44) and (45) analyzed using
Student’s t-test. For Figure 1c, the data from studies (46) and The Cancer
Genome Atlas melanoma (unpublished) were analyzed by one sample
t-test for foxm1 and cdkn2a gene copy numbers in melanoma and
cutaneous melanoma, respectively. For Figure 1d data from studies
(43) and (47) was processed for analysis of mRNAs that co-express with
FOXM1. The resulting analysis was further processed in Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis for 'upstream regulator' analysis. Shown are the top enzymes that
co-express with FOXM1 and their correlation score (r2). For Figure 2a, data
from (43, 44, 48) were analyzed for differential expression of Pin1, FOXM1,
CENPF, Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and actin (ACTA1), between the indicated
groups. All values, except for actin, were signiﬁcantly different between
skin and melanoma (study 2+3) or nevi and melanoma (study 3 only). For
Figure 2b, the r-values between the indicated mRNAs were determined to
address their correlation. For Figures 2c, z-score corrected expression
values of the indicated mRNAs were plotted and for each patient it was
determined whether a score was higher or lower than the experimental
mean. The number of markers higher than the experimental mean were
plotter for each patient and plotted in survival o1year or 42year.
Unpaired Student’s t-test analysis was used to compare the two cohorts.

Statistical analysis of experimental data
In all histograms, the s.d. is plotted, except for Celltiter AQueous One
(Promega) assays, where s.e.m. is plotted. In all cases Student’s t-tests were
applied to compare signiﬁcance between two groups. *P-value o0.05,
**P-value o 0.01.
