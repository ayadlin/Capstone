Inhibition of cholesterol metabolism underlies synergy between
mTOR pathway inhibition and chloroquine in bladder cancer cells
MA King1, IG Ganley2 and V Flemington3
Mutations to ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) signalling pathway
components (for example, PTEN loss, PIK3CA, AKT1, TSC1/2) are common in bladder cancer, yet small-molecule inhibitors of these
nodes (FGFR/PTENi) show only modest activity in preclinical models. As activation of autophagy is proposed to promote survival
under FGFR/PTENi, we have investigated this relationship in a panel of 18 genetically diverse bladder cell lines. We found that
autophagy inhibition does not sensitise bladder cell lines to FGFR/PTENi, but newly identify an autophagy-independent cell death
synergy in FGFR3-mutant cell lines between mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ)—an
anti-malarial drug used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials. The mechanism of synergy is consistent with
lysosomal cell death (LCD), including cathepsin-driven caspase activation, and correlates with suppression of cSREBP1 and
cholesterol biosynthesis in sensitive cell lines. Remarkably, loss of viability can be rescued by saturating cellular membranes with
cholesterol or recapitulated by statin-mediated inhibition, or small interfering RNA knockdown, of enzymes regulating cholesterol
metabolism. Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by atorvastatin and cholesterol is reproduced across numerous cell lines,
conﬁrming a novel and fundamental role for cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating LCD. Thus, we have catalogued the molecular
events underlying cell death induced by CQ in combination with an anticancer therapeutic. Moreover, by revealing a hitherto
unknown aspect of lysosomal biology under stress, we propose that suppression of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells should
elicit synergy with CQ and deﬁne a novel approach to future cancer treatments.

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer has a worldwide incidence of roughly 400 000
cases and 150 000 deaths per year, yet there are currently no
targeted therapeutics available to patients.1 The disease is
genetically complex and presents with a predominance of
activating mutations to ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3)
and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of
rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) (phosphatase and tensin homologue
(PTEN)) pathway, highlighting therapeutic opportunities at these
nodes.1–4 Nevertheless, small-molecule inhibitors to these kinases
have so far proven ineffective in preclinical models and there is
considerable interest in determining the modes of resistance to
FGFR and PTEN pathway inhibitors (FGFR/PTENi) in bladder cancer.
There is a direct and well-characterised link between AKT/mTOR
signalling and macroautophagy (autophagy), which may promote
cancer cell survival under PTEN pathway inhibition.5–9 Speciﬁcally,
the efﬁcacy of AKT inhibitors in bladder and prostate cancer
models, and EGFR/HER2 inhibition in breast and lung carcinomas,
is promoted by inhibiting autophagy with chloroquine (CQ).10–13
Autophagy describes the bulk sequestration of cytosol into
double-membraned vesicles and its fusion to the lysosome,
wherein substrates are degraded and recycled to support homeostasis under stress.14 Under normal conditions, mTOR represses
autophagy via the ATG13/ULK/FIP200 complex, which in turn
directs the nucleation of autophagosomes through the Beclin/
VPS34 complex.15–18 Following activation of autophagy, two

ubiquitin-like systems regulated by ATG7 mediate autophagosome maturation and completion by LC3 lipidation.19–21
We have investigated a function for autophagy in a panel of 18
bladder cancer cell lines treated with small-molecule inhibitors
targeting nodes of potential therapeutic relevance: FGFR, PI3Kβ/δ,
AKT and mTOR (FGFR/PTENi). Modulation of cell death was
quantiﬁed under these conditions and a function for autophagy
was assayed by knockdown of multiple essential components
(ATG13, ULK1/2, VPS34, ATG7, ATG3, ATG16L1 and ATG14),
CRISPR/Cas9 ATG7 knockout (KO) and chemical inhibitors including CQ, baﬁlomycin A1 (BafA1) and 3-methyladenine (3MA).
Our data reveal little evidence for autophagy in the promotion of
survival under FGFR/PTENi, but highlight an autophagyindependent synergistic cell death between AKT or mTOR
inhibition and CQ in FGFR-dependent cell lines.
Synergistic cell death showed features of lysosome-initiated
apoptosis, including cathepsin-dependent caspase activation. We
show that inhibition of FGFR/PI3Kα/AKT/mTOR nodes suppress the
expression of enzymes regulating cholesterol metabolism in FGFRdependent cell lines, correlating with the degree to which these
compounds potentiate CQ-induced cell death. This form of CQdriven synergistic cell death is profoundly inhibited by saturating
cellular membranes with cholesterol, or recapitulated by inhibiting
cholesterol metabolism with atorvastatin (Ato) and knockdown
of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes. Moreover, we found that
all FGFR3-mutant cell lines regulate cSREBP1 expression in
an mTORC1/2-dependent manner, sensitising these—but not

bladder cancer cell lines: FGFRi (AZD4547), PI3Kβ/δi (AZD8186),
AKTi (AZD5363) and mTORi (AZD2014); and assayed cell death
over 5 days.22–25 Data relating to RT112, which express
constitutively active FGFR3 (FGFR3-TACC3), are shown in
Figure 1 and used throughout this study to represent our major
ﬁndings.26 RT112 cultures showed marked sensitivity to both
FGFRi and mTORi, but tolerated AKTi and PI3Kβi (Figure 1a). This
pattern of cell death was also observed in MGH-U3—deﬁning
these two cell lines as FGFR-dependent—but absent across all
other cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1A). Nevertheless, FGFRi
signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation in all FGFR3-mutant cell lines,
whereas mTORi reduced proliferation across the panel
(Supplementary Figure S1C). Western blotting conﬁrms target
engagement, also showing that chronic AKT/mTOR inhibition
increases the efﬁciency of LC3 lipidation, but suppresses the volume
of LC3 ﬂux (Figure 1b and Supplementary Figures S1B–D).27
The contribution of autophagy to survival under FGFR/PTENi
was assayed by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated

FGFR-wild type (FGFR-WT)—cell lines to CQ-induced cell death
under mTORi. These results elucidate how CQ, which is currently
being used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials,
synergises with inhibitors of mTOR signalling and deﬁnes a patient
cohort predicted to respond to this combination. This work also
highlights a fundamental feature of lysosomal membrane biology,
suggesting that cancer therapeutics that impact cholesterol
metabolism should combine with CQ and provide an innovative
approach to cancer treatment.
RESULTS
Genetic inhibition of autophagy does not increase the sensitivity
of bladder cancer cell lines to FGFR/PTENi
Autophagy is reported to promote survival under RTK and AKT
inhibition in multiple preclinical cancer models. We therefore used
a selection of highly selective and potent kinase inhibitors
targeting relevant genetic aberrations along these pathways in

knockdown of key signalling components coupling mTOR to
autophagy activation: ATG13, ULK1/2 and VPS34; and the core
autophagy protein ATG7 (Figure 1c). Considerable suppression of
protein expression and autophagic ﬂux was achieved in RT112
cells (Figure 1d), and validated across six bladder cancer cell lines
(ATG13: 95% knockdown, 68% ﬂux inhibition; ULK: 97% knockdown, 61% ﬂux inhibition; VPS34: 94% knockdown, 56% ﬂux
inhibition; and ATG7: 96% knockdown, 51% ﬂux inhibition).
A functional consequence of autophagy inhibition by siRNA is
demonstrated by the exacerbation of cell death following
starvation in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) for 24 h
(Figure 1e). Importantly, in combination with FGFR/PTENi, inhibiting the activation of autophagy (ATG13, ULK and VPS34 siRNAs)
did not increase cell death in RT112 or any other bladder
cell line, irrespective of genetic aberrations to the PTEN pathway,
although proliferation was moderately suppressed (Figure 1f and
Supplementary Figures S2A–C).
RT112 cells showed some evidence for the potentiation of
FGFR/mTORi-induced cell death by ATG7 siRNA (Figure 1f);
however, on deconvolving the SMARTpool, we found signiﬁcant
variability in cytotoxicity despite similar ATG7 knockdown
(Supplementary Figure S2D). We therefore assayed the role of
core autophagy components downstream of ATG7 by siRNA
knockdown of ATG3, ATG16L1 and ATG14. Again, however, we
show that these components do not contribute to the innate
resistance of RT112 cells to FGFR/PTENi (Figures 1g and h). To
assay directly a function for ATG7, we generated ATG7 KO clones
from RT112 cultures using CRISPR/Cas9. RT112 ATG7 KO cultures
were disabled for LC3 lipidation and autophagy (Figure 1i), yet
showed no increase in sensitivity to FGFR/PTENi (Figure 1j).
Conversely, ATG7 KO cells showed increased tolerance for FGFRi
and mTORi, similar to that observed under ATG13, ULK and VPS34
knockdown (Figure 1f). Thus, neither the activation of autophagy
nor core autophagic processes contribute to the innate resistance
of bladder cancer cell lines to FGFR/PTENi.
Potentiation of CQ-induced cell death by AKTi is limited to
FGFR-dependent cell lines
As previous studies reported synergistic cell death between CQ
and AKTi, we next screened the bladder panel for combinations of
chemical autophagy inhibitors and AKTi or mTORi. CQ, BafA1 and
3MA were used to block autophagy, whereas rapamycin (Rapa)
was included to inhibit mTORC1. Over 4 days, a clear difference
emerged in the pattern of cell death across the bladder panel,
dividing the cell lines into three types (Figure 2a and
Supplementary Figure S3). Type-I cells displayed no evidence for
the potentiation of CQ-, BafA1- or 3MA-induced cell death with
AKT or mTOR inhibitors. Conversely, most lines showed signiﬁcant
protection against BafA1 or CQ cytotoxicity with mTORi (for
example, UM-UC-3 and SW1710), correlating with an inhibition of
BNIP3 induction, BID cleavage and caspase-3 (CASP3) activation
(Figure 2b). This protection was recapitulated by blocking cell
cycle progression with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, indicating
that BafA1-induced cell death is compounded by proliferation
(Supplementary Figures S3B and C). Type-II cells are deﬁned by
the moderate potentiation of CQ-induced cell death with mTORi,
all of which express activating FGFR3 mutations (for example, J82,
97-7). Finally, type-III cells show substantial potentiation of
CQ-induced cell death with both AKT and mTOR inhibitors. This
response was only observed in FGFR-dependent cell lines—MGHU3 and RT112—and correlated with BID cleavage and caspase-3
activation (Figures 2a and b). These cells also show moderate
potentiation of 3MA-induced cell death with AKTi and mTORi;
however, when compared with the exquisite selectivity of BafA1, it
is unlikely that this effect is related to inhibition of autophagic ﬂux
(Supplementary Figures S3F and G). Rapa treatment demonstrates
that type-III cells tolerate mTORC1 inhibition alone, but that

targeting this node is sufﬁcient to potentiate cell death with CQ.
In contrast, CQ-induced cell death is signiﬁcantly abated by
palbociclib, indicating that similar to BafA1, proliferation exacerbates CQ toxicity (Supplementary Figure S3H).
Disruption to autophagy by BafA1 and CQ is conﬁrmed by the
accumulation of LC3-II by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, revealing that lysosomes swell to 2–5 times their
original size under these conditions (Figures 2b–d). In contrast,
3MA showed little effect on LC3-II by immunoblotting, which is
reported for other VPS34 inhibitors, yet prevented LC3 punctation
by immunocytochemistry.28 Overall, this screen shows that
chemical autophagy inhibitors do not generally increase the
sensitivity of bladder cell lines to AKT or mTOR inhibitors, yet
highlights an intriguing response to these compounds in
combination with CQ in FGFR-dependent cells.
AKTi and mTORi enhance CQ-induced LCD
We reproduced the potentiation of CQ-induced cell death by AKTi
and mTORi in RT112 ATG7 KO cells, to demonstrate conclusively
that autophagy is unrelated to this cytotoxicity (Figure 3a).
Although RT112 ATG7 KO cells showed a small increase in CQ
tolerance (cell death EC50 (cdEC50) = 48 μM; P = 0.003) versus wildtype (WT) (cdEC50) = 30 μM), their ultimate sensitivity also conﬁrms
that CQ-induced cell death is autophagy-independent. CQ is
known to cause lysosomal membrane permeabilisation, cathepsin
leakage and activation of BID and caspases.29,30 We therefore
investigated the role of cathepsins in caspase activation and cell
death induced by CQ in combination with AKTi and mTORi. We
ﬁnd that CASP3 activity is only observed when AKTi or mTORi are
combined with CQ, whereas treatment with AKTi, mTORi or CQ
alone is not sufﬁcient to induce its activation (Figures 3c and d).
Moreover, CASP3 activation under these conditions is completely
suppressed by co-treatment with a cathepsin B/L inhibitor
(Ca-074Me) and partially suppressed by the pancathepsin
inhibitors E64D and pepstatinA.31 This assay clearly positions
cathepsins upstream of caspase activation in this mode of
cell death.
Cathepsin inhibition by Ca-074Me also considerably inhibited
RT112 cell death with CQ and mTORi (from 74%, ± s.e. 4% to 31%,
± s.e. 6%; P = 0.004; Figure 3e), supporting the relevance of
cathepsin-mediated caspase activation to cell death. Additionally,
both Ca-074Me and the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD rescued the
number of viable cells under mTORi+CQ treatment to roughly the
same value as that measured for mTORi treatment alone: from
35% (± s.e. 13%) to 96% ( ± s.d. 13%) with Ca-074Me and to 84%
( ± s.d. 28%) with zVAD. That E64D and pepstatinA did not robustly
protect against cell death or CASP3 activation under mTORiinduced potentiation of CQ toxicity is likely due to the hydrolysis
of E64d—which inhibits cathepsins B, H and L—in the culture
medium.31–33 To assay directly the role of CTSB in this model of
cell death and clarify the involvement of BID, we knocked down
these components by siRNA. Figure 3f shows that both BID and
CTSB siRNA robustly inhibited cell death induced by CQ in
combination with both AKTi and mTORi. The mechanism of
synergistic cell death is therefore autophagy-independent, showing characteristics of apoptosis cross-talk activated by lysosomal
membrane permeabilisation.29
Suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis by AKTi and mTORi
underlies synergy with CQ
Given that AKTi and mTORi only potentiate CQ-induced cell death
in FGFR-dependent cell lines, we investigated how FGFR3
signalling might regulate lysosomal cell death (LCD). A possible
link between these two pathways was found in reports showing
that (i) FGFR3 maintains the expression of genes required for fatty
acid and cholesterol biosynthesis via SREBP1; and (ii) lysosomal
cholesterol can regulate membrane integrity and LCD.34,35 FGFRi is

Figure 2. Potentiation of CQ-induced cell death by AKTi or mTORi is restricted to FGFR3-dependent cell lines. Bladder cancer cell lines were

known to induce cell death by suppressing SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA
desaturase-13) expression, which we now found to also underlie
mTORi cytotoxicity. Both FGFRi- and mTORi-induced cell death is
rescued by oleic acid, the product of SCD1 activity (Supplementary
Figure S4A), and correlates with complete suppression of SCD1
expression. However, as a lower dose of mTORi (0.25 μM) does not
induce cell death, but potentiates CQ-induced cell death, we used
this concentration for subsequent experiments.34
Immunoblotting shows that FGFRi and mTORi fully suppress the
expression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol enzymes in RT112 cultures,
whereas AKTi and PI3Kαi partially suppress this pathway
(Figures 4a and b). Remarkably, suppression of cSREBP1 by
FGFR/PTENi signiﬁcantly correlates with the exacerbation CQinduced cell death; Pearson’s r (R2) = 0.871 (P = 0.0065; Figures 4b–c).
Thus, CQ-induced cell death is not modulated by PI3Kβi (P = 0.9657
to ctrl), but similarly exacerbated by PI3Kαi (P = 0.0008 to ctrl) and
AKTi (P = 0.0002 to ctrl; P = 0.9013 to PI3Kαi). However, inhibition of
mTOR (Po0.0001 to ctrl) and FGFR (P = 0.0003 to ctrl) further
potentiate CQ-induced cell death, although the curve for FGFRi is
clearly different to the other conditions, suggesting interference

by additional factors. To further investigate cholesterol biosynthesis in CQ-induced LCD, we inhibited HMGCR—a rate-limiting
enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis—with Ato, or saturated
cellular membranes with water-soluble cholesterol.36,37 Figure 4d
shows that Ato exacerbates CQ-induced cell death, whereas
cholesterol is signiﬁcantly protective. Furthermore, we could
recapitulate the effects of AKTi on CQ toxicity by knocking down
the expression of HMGCS1 or DHCR7 (Figures 4e and f).
Importantly, at low doses of CQ, a clear synergy is observed with
mTORi and AKTi, which is robustly (mTORi) or completely (AKTi)
suppressed by cholesterol (Figures 4g and h). However, cholesterol did not protect against the monotherapy toxicity of either
FGFR or mTORi, nor other apoptotic insults including staurosporine, TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand) and proteasome inhibition, showing that it is not generally
protective against apoptosis (Supplementary Figures S4B and C).
Furthermore, cholesterol did not inhibit lysosomal neutralization
by CQ or BafA1, demonstrating that protection is conferred
downstream of the function of these compounds (Supplementary
Figures S4D and E). Suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol

Figure 3. Synergy between CQ and AKTi or mTORi is autophagy-independent and driven by cathepsins. RT112 ATG7 KO cells were incubated with
AKT/mTORi (1 μM) before the addition of CQ (20 μM). (a) Histogram shows quantiﬁcation of cell death at day 4, revealing synergy in autophagydisabled cells (n = 4; mean ± s.e.). (b) RT112 WT and ATG7 KO cells were incubated with CQ (1–80 μM) for 4 days and quantiﬁed for cell death. Line

RT112 cells were treated with the AKTi (c) or mTORi (d) and CQ (20 μM) in combination with Ca-074Me (10 μM), E64D and pepstatinA (E/P; 30 μM/
30 μM) and zVAD (20 μM) for 3 days. Cultures were incubated with the caspase-3 ﬂuorogenic substrate NucView-488 and imaged every 6 h for
ﬂuorescence (λ475(40)/535(45)) and cellular conﬂuency. Data are plotted as the number of ﬂuorescent nuclei divided by cellular conﬂuence (data

biosynthesis enzymes by FGFRi, mTORi and AKTi was also
conﬁrmed in the other type-III line, MGH-U3, wherein cholesterol
again signiﬁcantly protects against synergistic cell death induced
by CQ and AKTi (Figures 4i and j). However, MGH-U3 cultures do
not show suppression of cSREBP1 or potentiation of CQ-induced
cell death with PI3Kα inhibition, likely due to the expression of a
downstream AKT1(E17K)-activating mutation, which sustains AKT
activation and PRAS40 phosphorylation under PI3Kαi. Thus,
suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol biosynthesis pathway
correlates with the potentiation of CQ-induced cell death, which is
robustly inhibited by saturation of cellular membranes with
cholesterol.
Cholesterol depletion by AKTi sensitises lysosomes to CQ-induced
membrane permeabilisation
We used ﬁlipin to visualise cellular cholesterol and show that
whereas AKTi and Ato alone cause little measureable change to
cellular cholesterol, both compounds combine with CQ to deplete
severely intracellular cholesterol (Figure 5a). Under these conditions, cholesterol treatment rescues cellular cholesterol, saturating
intracellular vesicle-like structures throughout the cell. These
observations were also quantiﬁed by ﬂuorometric detection of
free cellular cholesterol (Supplementary Figure S4F). To assay
lysosomal membrane permeabilisation, we quantiﬁed the loss of
cathepsin immunoreactivity from punctate cytosolic structures
and the formation of galectin-3 foci, a marker for damaged
endomembranes.38 Figure 5b shows that the combination of CQ
with AKTi results in the substantial loss of punctate cathepsin
staining and a signiﬁcant increase in galectin-3 aggregates.
Remarkably, these changes were almost completely prevented
by cholesterol. Furthermore, lysosomal swelling induced by CQ
alone or in combination with AKTi is also robustly blocked by

cholesterol (Figure 5c). However, we could not detect the cytosolic
translocation of lysosomal cathepsins by microscopy or fractionation (indicating a short half-life once released). Nevertheless, we
found that the combination of CQ with AKTi causes lysosomal
cathepsin depletion, correlating with cytochrome c release, before
the onset of caspase activation (Supplementary Figure S4G). Taken
together, our data show that cellular cholesterol depletion and
lysosomotropic stress by AKTi+CQ causes lysosomal swelling,
damage, cathepsin release and cell death, which are profoundly
rescued by saturating cellular membranes with cholesterol.
Cholesterol availability is a general determinant to CQ sensitivity
Figure 6 shows that type-I and -II bladder cancer cell lines do not
show the same regulation of SREBP1 by FGFRi, PI3Ki and AKTi as
type-III cells (RT112 and MGH-U3), despite the presence (top) or
absence (bottom) of FGFR3 mutations. However, all cell lines
carrying FGFR3 mutations showed suppression of cSREBP1
expression by mTORi, which correlated with a signiﬁcant
exacerbation of CQ-induced cell death in four out of ﬁve cell
lines. All cell lines showed robust protection against CQ toxicity
with cholesterol, whereas Ato exacerbated cell death. We also
found that cholesterol signiﬁcantly protects against BafA1induced cholesterol loss, cell death and lysosomal swelling across
the bladder panel (Supplementary Figures S5A–D). However, Ato
did not potentiate BafA1 toxicity, indicating that maximal cell
death is elicited at normal cellular cholesterol concentrations; a
feature that mitigates its use as a therapeutic (Supplementary
Figure S5E).39 Moreover, cholesterol signiﬁcantly protects against
both CQ and BafA1 cytotoxicity in primary human ﬁbroblasts,
suggesting that a widespread mode of cell death induced by
these compounds is lysosomal destabilisation, as opposed to the
inhibition of autophagy (Supplementary Figure S5F).40–43 Overall,

this study indicates a general role for cholesterol homeostasis in
maintaining lysosomal membrane integrity under stress, which
supports a rationale for combinations of CQ with targeted
therapeutics that block cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells.
DISCUSSION
Despite the increasing number of reports suggesting a role for
autophagy in the response of cancers to therapeutics, little detail
has emerged to account for the molecular mechanisms that
elicit either prosurvival or prodeath autophagy.9 Nevertheless, CQ
is currently being used as an adjuvant to anticancer therapies in

over 30 clinical trials.9 Herein, we have shown across a
genetically diverse range of bladder cancer lines that synergy
between mTOR pathway inhibition and CQ is restricted to
FGFR3-mutant cancers, and that suppression of cholesterol
metabolism, not autophagy, underlies lysosomal destabilisation
and cell death.
Role of autophagy in bladder cancer
Our knockdown of numerous autophagy-targeting genes convincingly demonstrates that the activation of autophagy does not
contribute to the innate resistance of bladder cancers to FGFR/
PTENi. These experiments highlight the differential requirements

Figure 5. Water-soluble cholesterol saturates intracellular membranes under CQ treatment and rescues loss of cathepsin release, lysosomal

and stained with ﬁlipin to visualise cholesterol (green; Hoechst staining in blue; n = 3). High-magniﬁcation imaging reveals that Chol saturates
numerous punctate vesicle-like structures throughout the cytosol, consistent with endo/lysosomal localisation (right). (b and c) RT112 cells

for autophagy under genuine starvation, where autophagy
inhibition exacerbates cell death, compared with inhibitors of
mitogenic signalling, where suppression of autophagy does not
enhance cell death. Our data do however support a role for
autophagy in the optimal growth of bladder cancer cells, which
may underlie the trend for autophagy siRNAs or ATG7 KO to mildly
protect against FGFRi and mTORi.44,45 Furthermore, by robustly
blocking autophagosome degradation and recycling with CQ
and BafA1, we also rule out a role for constitutive bulk autophagic ﬂux as a cytoprotective pathway under AKTi and mTORi
in bladder cancers. These experiments did, however, identify a
synergy between CQ and AKT or mTOR inhibitors in FGFRdependent cancers. Our subsequent work brings together
recent ﬁndings describing the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by FGFR3 and the function of cholesterol in regulating

Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by inhibition of cholesterol
biosynthesis
The induction of LCD by CQ has been well characterised in HeLa
cells and recently shown to be potentiated by a dual PI3K/AKT
inhibitor in neuroblastomas.29,30,46,47 Our model shares signiﬁcant
similarities with these reports, as synergistic cell death is unrelated
to autophagy and requires cathepsin and BID activity upstream of
caspase activation. However, we further show that the degree to
which FGFR/PTENi potentiate CQ cytotoxicity correlates with
suppression of cSREBP1 and loss of cellular cholesterol. Importantly, both FGFRi and mTORi lower the EC50 of CQ to
therapeutically relevant concentrations ( ~6 μM), indicating that
CQ may considerably improve the efﬁcacy of these compounds
in vivo.42,48,49

Figure 6. Potentiation of CQ-induced cell death is linked to the suppression of cSREBP1 expression and recapitulated with atorvastatin (Ato),

pathway, suggests that FGFR regulates mTORC1/2-cSREBP1
through both PI3K/AKT-dependent and -independent (for
example, PLCγ or RAS/MAPK) signalling. This is consistent with
reports that SREBP1 is regulated by multiple pathways and
indicates that the complete suppression of cSREBP1 is required to
maximally potentiate CQ-induced cell death.50–52 Moreover, we
found that all FGFR3-mutant cell lines stabilise cSREBP1 via
mTORC1/2, yet do not show the same regulation of cSREBP1, or
potentiation of CQ-induced cell death, with FGFRi or AKTi
(Figure 6). Since S6 phosphorylation is also maintained under
these conditions, we interpret this data to indicate that other
mTORC1/2 signalling pathways are activated in these cells, which
are sufﬁcient to promote SREBP1 activation in the FGFR3 mutant
background. Interestingly, the presence of FGFR3 mutations
correlates with the potentiation of CQ-induced cell death in only
six of the seven cell lines. RT4 cells do not ﬁt this trend, possibly
due to a coincident RhoA(A161V) mutation that may alter
cholesterol or membrane dynamics.53 In contrast, FGFR3-WT cell
lines regulate cSREBP1 expression independently of mTORC1/2
and therefore do not show potentiation of CQ-induced cell death
with mTORi. Rather, many of these lines show signiﬁcant
protection against CQ toxicity with mTORi, suggesting that
whether mTORi potentiates or inhibits CQ-induced cell death
may be determined by the balance of its effects on cholesterol
availability versus inhibition of proliferation.

As activating FGFR3 mutations are found in up to 80% of lowgrade noninvasive bladder tumours, the combination of CQ with
mTOR pathway inhibitors may therefore beneﬁt a substantial
population of patients.26 Other transforming RTK mutations may
similarly control cholesterol biosynthesis and present opportunities for eliciting synergistic cell death between relevant
inhibitors and CQ. We provide proof of principle for this approach
by showing that inhibition of cholesterol metabolism with a statin,
or knockdown of key cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes, recapitulates synergistic cell death in numerous cell lines. However, in
RT112 cells, knockdown of HMGCS1 and DHCR7, or Ato treatment,
exacerbated cell death to a similar extent as AKTi, rather than to
the level observed with mTORi. Additionally, the suppression of
cSREBP1 by mTORi in FGFR3-mutant lines only partially inhibited
the expression of cholesterol enzymes, yet resulted in a similar
potentiation of CQ toxicity to Ato. Conversely, some FGFR3-WT
cells showed mTORi-induced suppression of cholesterol enzyme
expression in the absence of changes to cSREBP1 expression and
CQ-induced cell death. Thus, additional mechanisms may regulate
the expression of these enzymes and the availability of cellular
cholesterol, which will require further elucidation.

Figure 7. FGFR signalling and model for the role of cholesterol biosynthesis in the maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity under CQand BafA1-induced stress. (a) FGFR-dependent (blue text) and FGFR3-mutant (light blue text only) bladder cancer cell lines maintain cSREBP1
expression in an mTORC1/2-dependent manner (left). In contrast, FGFR3-WT cells (green text) maintain cSREBP1 independently of mTORC1/2
signalling. (b) CQ is a weak base that diffuses into lysosomes (grey circles), neutralises the pH and becomes trapped by protonation, inducing
osmotic stress, lysosomal swelling, cathepsin release and lysosomal cell death (LCD). Inhibition of FGFR, AKT or mTOR signalling in FGFRdependent cell lines or HMGCR (Ato) in all cell lines, depletes cellular cholesterol and accelerates LCD (Fast LCD). In contrast, saturation of
cellular membranes with water-soluble cholesterol (+Chol) prevents CQ-induced lysosomal swelling, cathepsin loss and cell death (Slow LCD).
Lysosomal membrane cholesterol is known to regulate permeability to water and ions; however, this is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate that
inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis underlies the potentiation of CQ-induced LCD in cancer cells. Furthermore, we propose that watersoluble cholesterol can be used to determine the relative contribution of LCD versus autophagy inhibition in future studies examining the
potentiation of therapeutic-induced cell death with lysosomal inhibitors.

lysosomotropic stress. These results can be explained by known
features of cholesterol homeostasis and lysosomal membrane
biology: (i) neutralisation of the endo/lysosomal system blocks the
processing of extracellularly derived cholesterol esters, rendering
cells dependent on the biosynthesis pathway; and (ii) lysosomal
membrane cholesterol decreases permeability to water and ions,
suppressing swelling and destabilization under osmotic stress.54–56
Thus, under inhibition of both cholesterol uptake (for example, CQ)
and cholesterol biosynthesis (for example, AKTi), osmotic stress is
enhanced, resulting in accelerated membrane permeabilisation,
cathepsin release and cell death (Figure 7; blue text).57 In contrast,
saturation of cellular membranes with cholesterol blocks CQ- and
BafA1-induced LCD upstream of swelling and membrane permeabilisation. Given the efﬁcacy by which water-soluble cholesterol
prevents both BafA1- and CQ-induced LCD, we propose that this
method can be used as a novel assay to clarify the contribution of
LCD versus autophagy inhibition in cell death studies combining
CQ with other therapeutics in vitro.38
Concluding remarks
Our results delineate for the ﬁrst time the mechanistic basis for
synergy between CQ and a targeted anticancer therapeutic and
stress caution in the interpretation of studies reporting enhanced
drug efﬁcacy in combination with CQ. These data also highlight
the exciting therapeutic potential for CQ in combination with
mTOR pathway inhibitors in patients with activating FGFR3
mutations. Finally, by revealing a role for cholesterol biosynthesis
in maintaining lysosomal integrity under stress, we propose that
therapeutics which suppress cholesterol metabolism in other
cancer types may present similar opportunities for eliciting
synergistic cell death with CQ, thereby deﬁning a novel approach
to future cancer treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Reagents were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA), except where
indicated. Cell lines were sourced from: RT112/84 (ECACC, Salisbury, UK);
TCC-SUP, J82, SW780, T24, 1A6, UM-UC-3, HT-1197, HT-1376, 5637, RT4,
SCaBER (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA); VM-CUB-1, 647-V, BFTC-905, KU-19-19,
SW1710 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany); MGH-U3 and 97-7 (LIMM,
Leeds, UK); and human ﬁbroblasts (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany). All
cell lines tested mycoplasma negative by Chan test. Cells were cultured in
DMEM (Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium) containing 10% fetal calf
serum and 1% L-glutamine at 37 °C (5% CO2) and passaged weekly. For
Oncogene (2016) 4518 – 4528

nutrient starvation, cells were washed three times in prewarmed EBSS
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). AZD4547, AZD8186, AZD8835, AZD5363,
AZD2014 and Ato were made by AstraZeneca (Macclesﬁeld, UK) and
resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide to 10 mM. All other reagents were
reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide except: CQ (200 mM phosphatebuffered saline (PBS)); 3MA (20 mM DMEM); cycloheximide (10 mg/ml
water), cholesterol (10 mg/ml PBS); and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (100 mM
DMEM). CA-074Me was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA).
Free cholesterol was quantiﬁed using ab65359 Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
SmartPOOL ON-TARGET siRNAs (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) were
resuspended in water at 10 μM and reverse transfected by adding
nine volumes of cell suspension to one volume of siRNA (10 nM
ﬁnal concentration) premixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) in OPTI-MEM (Gibco).

Microscopy and cell death assays
Cells were seeded at a density of 5 000/ml in 96-well plates and stained
with SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)
and Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) following treatment. Total and dead cells
were quantiﬁed using a Cellomics ArrayScan XTI (ArrayScan; 12 ﬁelds;
41000 cells) with appropriate ﬁlter settings. cdEC50s were calculated
using Origin 7.5 SR6 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). For
CASP3 activation assays, NucView-488 Caspase-3 substrate (Biotum,
Hayward, CA, USA) was incubated with cells at 1 μM in an IncuCyte ZOOM
(Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) for 5 days. The frequency of
NucView-488 signals was quantiﬁed using ZOOM GUI version 2014A, and
normalised for cell conﬂuency using processing deﬁnitions adapted for
each cell line.

Immunocytochemistry
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5–5x104/ml and
formalin-ﬁxed for 20 min following treatment. Cultures were washed three
times in PBS and blocked (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton) for 1 h
before overnight incubation (4 °C) with primary antibodies and 1 h
incubations with secondary antibodies. For LC3 and LAMP-I immunostaining, cultures were postﬁxed in 100% ice-cold methanol for 15 min.
Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signalling Technologies (Danvers,
MA, USA) except: anti-galectin-3 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), anticathepsin L (Abcam). Secondary antibodies from Molecular Probes were
used at a 1:500 and visualised by ArrayScan. LAMP-I puncta were
quantiﬁed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) by measuring the area
of the three largest and clearly deﬁned immunopositive structures per cell
(three ﬁelds; three independent experiments). Galectin-3-positive cells
were deﬁned by the presence of three or more cytosolic aggregates.
For ﬁlipin staining, ﬁxed cultures were quenched in glycine (1.5 mg/ml PBS;
10 min), rinsed and incubated with 25 μg/ml ﬁlipin-PBS (60 min) washed
and visualised by ArrayScan.

Immunoblotting
Cells were seeded at 0.5–2x105/ml and lysed in sodium dodecyl sulphatebased buffer following treatment. Lysates were normalised for protein
concentration (BCA assay; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), boiled in sample
buffer (NuPage+DTT; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and loaded
at 10 μg per lane on Criterion gels (4–20%). Gels were transferred to
nitrocellulose, blocked (5% milk-TBS-T) and incubated overnight (4 °C) with
primary antibodies. All antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology
except: cathepsin B (Calbiochem), HMGCS1 (Sigma), FRS-2 (R&D Systems)
and HMGCR, IDI-I and DHCR7 (Abcam). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h and visualised by ECL
(Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using ﬁlm (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden) or CCD (Chemigenius; Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA). Films were
scanned at 600 dpi and analysed for densitometry using ImageJ (NIH).
Cellular fractionation was performed using Kit No. 9038 from Cell
Signalling.

CRISPR
A sequence targeting ATG7 exon 1 (5′-AAGCTGAACGAGTATCGGC-3′) was
synthesised (Sigma) within a guide RNA plasmid also encoding
Cas9-GFP. The Cas9/gRNA was puriﬁed by Endo-free maxi prep (Qiagen,
Germantown, MD, USA), transfected using FuGENE HD (Promega,
Fitchburg, WI, USA). Cells were sorted for GFP ﬂuorescence after 48 h
(BD FACSAria Ilu, BD Biosciences) and seeded at 1 cell per well in 96-well
plates. Cultures were monitored for single clones until conﬂuency,
passaged and assayed for ATG7 and LC3-II expression by western blotting.

Statistics
Data were analysed for statistical signiﬁcance using one-way analysis of
variance followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test to compare treatment
means to control means (JMP12.0.1; SAS, Cary, NC, USA). Where indicated,
Student’s t-test was used to compare means from at least three
independent experiments.
