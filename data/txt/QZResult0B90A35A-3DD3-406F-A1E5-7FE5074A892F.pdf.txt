Abstract
Osteosarcoma is the most commonly occurring bone cancer in children and adolescents. Unfortunately,
treatment failures are common due to the development of chemoresistance, for which the underlying molecular
mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we implicate the DNA-binding protein HMGB1, which also exerts
immunoregulatory effects in its secreted form, in the development of drug resistance in osteosarcoma. Anticancer
agents including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate each induced HMGB1 upregulation in human
osteosarcoma cells, and RNA interference–mediated knockdown of HMGB1 restored the chemosensitivity of
osteosarcoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic investigation revealed that HMGB1 increased drug resistance
by inducing autophagy, an intracellular self-defense mechanism known to confer drug resistance. We found that
HMGB1 bound to the autophagy regulator Beclin1 and regulated the formation of the Beclin1–PI3KC3 [PI3KC3,
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class 3] complex that facilitates autophagic progression. In addition, we found that
interaction between HMGB1 and Beclin1 relied upon the autophagic complex ULK1–mAtg13–FIP200. Therefore,
through its role as a regulator of autophagy, HMGB1 is a critical factor in the development of chemoresistance,
and it offers a novel target for improving osteosarcoma therapy. Cancer Res; 72(1); 230–8. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Osteosarcoma is the most common form of childhood and
adolescent cancer, comprising 2.4% of all malignancies in
pediatric patients and approximately 20% of all primary bone
cancers (1). In the last 3 decades, the use of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in combination with surgery has increased the
long-term survival rate of osteosarcoma patients. Cisplatin,
doxorubicin, and methotrexate are commonly used anticancer
drugs in osteosarcoma (2, 3). Patients that do not respond to
these drugs have a poor prognosis. Moreover, the frequent
acquisition of drug-resistant phenotypes and the occurrence of
"secondary malignancies" are often associated with chemotherapy and are signiﬁcant obstacles to achieving favorable
outcomes. Thus, the analysis of the molecular mechanisms
underlying the resistance of osteosarcoma cancer cells to
chemotherapy is essential for the development of novel treatment strategies for this disease.

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a chromatin-binding
nuclear protein, is expressed in many types of cells and is
involved in several inﬂammatory diseases (4, 5). HMGB1
expression has also been linked to cancer development by
interfering with several signaling pathways (6). Autophagy is a
fundamental lysosomal process to confer stress tolerance and
involves a series of steps including the formation of the
phagophore, the autophagosome, and ﬁnally the autolysosome
(7, 8). A number of studies have shown a critical role for
autophagy in cancer development and therapy (9–11). Autophagy can promote or inhibit cancer cell growth depending on
tumor types. For example, autophagy promotes pancreatic
cancer growth (12) and inhibits breast carcinoma (13). In
addition, there is a complicated relationship between autophagy and apoptosis following antitumor therapy that culminates in the determination of cancer cell fate. Recent studies
suggest that HMGB1 plays a role in facilitating autophagy
following cytotoxic insults including starvation (14–17). However, the mechanism and signiﬁcance of HMGB1-mediated
autophagy in tumor therapy still remains largely unknown.
In this study, we show that HMGB1-mediated autophagy
contributes to chemotherapy resistance in osteosarcoma in
vivo and in vitro. Our experimental data suggest an important
role for HMGB1 in the regulation of autophagy through controlling the formation of Beclin 1–PI3KC3 [PI3KC3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class 3] complex. These ﬁndings reveal
novel potential targets for the treatment of osteosarcoma.

(ATCC) and characterized according to ATCC instructions.
These cells maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium
or McCoy's 5a Medium Modiﬁed supplemented with 10% FBS.
All cell lines were used within 20 passages. The antibodies to
actin, Beclin 1, PI3KC3, C-PARP, ULK1, and P-ULK1 were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The antibodies to
HMGB1 and mAtg13 antibody were obtained from Abcam. The
antibodies to LC3, FIP200, and Atg7 were obtained from
NOVUS. Other reagents were from Sigma.
Cell viability analysis
Cell viability was evaluated by the Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo Laboratories) test as previously described (18).
CCK-8 allows convenient cellular viability measurement using
the enzymatic substrate, WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt). WST-8 is reduced by dehydrogenase activity in
cells to yield a formazan dye, which is soluble in the tissue
culture media and detected colorimetrically at an absorbance
of 450 nm. The amount of the formazan dye is directly proportional to the number of living cells.
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared with cell lysis buffer [20 mmol/
L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mmol/L NaCl; 1 mmol/L Na2EDTA; 1
mmol/L EGTA; 1% Triton; 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate; 1 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate; 1 mmol/L Na3VO4;
1 mg/mL leupeptin; 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride
(PMSF); and 1 mmol/L PMSF]. The lysates were cleared
by centrifugation and total protein concentration was
measured with the bicinchoninic acid assay Kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Proteins were resolved on a denaturing 10%
SDS-PAGE gel and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes via semidry transfer. The membrane was then blocked in 5% dried milk or 3% bovine
serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (10
mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mmol/L NaCl; and 0.1% Tween20),
incubated with primary antibodies, and then with appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Actin protein was used as a loading
control.
Quantitative real-time PCR
cDNA from various cell samples were ampliﬁed by real-time
quantitative PCR with speciﬁc primers for HMGB1 (upper
TCAAAGGAGAACATCCTGGCCTGT, lower CTGCTTGTCATCTGCAGCAGTGTT) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; upper GGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGG,
lower GGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACGATACC) with the iQ SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Data were normalized to GAPDH
expression. The control group was set as 1.
Immunoprecipitation analysis
Cells were lysed at 4 C in RIPA buffer (Millipore). Prior to
immunoprecipitation, samples containing equal amounts of
proteins were precleared with Protein A sepharose (Millipore)
and subsequently incubated with various irrelevant immuno-

www.aacrjournals.org

globulin or speciﬁc antibodies in the presence of protein A
sepharose beads. The beads were washed 3 times with RIPA
buffer and the immune complexes were eluted from the beads
and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as
previously described (19, 20).
Gene transfection and RNAi
Transfection with pUNO1-HMGB1 cDNA (Invivogen) and/
or HMGB1-shRNA, Beclin 1-shRNA, PI3KC3-shRNA, and
Atg7 shRNA (Sigma) was carried out by the Lipofectamine
2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) according the manufacturer's instructions. As a control experiment (Fig. 2F),
another HMGB1-shRNA was obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.
Apoptosis assays
The degree of apoptosis in cells was assessed by an Annexin
V–propidium iodide Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen) by ﬂow cytometric analysis as previously described (17).
The degree of apoptosis in tissue was assessed with TUNEL
(terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling) kit from Roche Applied Science as previously
described (18). Caspase 3 activity was analyzed by Colorimetric
Caspase 3 Assay Kit (Merck) according the manufacturer's
instructions.
Autophagy assays
Formation of autophagic vesicles was monitored by
endogenous LC3 aggregation in cell lines by LC3 antibody
or mRFP–GFP–LC3 (Invitrogen). Autophagosomes have
both mRFP and GFP signals, whereas the autolysosomes
emit only mRFP signal because of the quenching of GFP in
the acidic lysosomal environment (21, 22). The protein levels
of LC3 and p62 was determined by Western blotting. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) assessment of autophagosomes-like structures was carried out as previously
described (23, 24).
Mice xenograft models
To generate murine subcutaneous tumors, 0.5  106 MG-63
cells transfected with control or HMGB1-speciﬁc shRNA were
injected subcutaneously to the right of the dorsal midline in
nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/
SCID) mice (The Jackson Laboratory) as previously described
(25). One week after injection, the subcutaneous tumor size
had reached a diameter of approximately 3 mm, and the mice
then received i.p. injections of doxorubicin (5 mg/kg) twice a
week thereafter. Tumor volumes were calculated by the following formula: length  width2  p/6 (18). All animal experiments strictly followed the guidelines of the Institutional
Review Board.
Statistical analysis
In all experiments, unless otherwise indicated, data are
reported as mean  SEM in at least 3 replicates per group.
Data were analyzed by 2-tailed Student t test or ANOVA least
signiﬁcant difference test, and P < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
Anticancer agents promote HMGB1 expression in
osteosarcoma cells
First, we assayed the effects of the anticancer agents doxorubicin (Dox), cisplatin (Cis), and methotrexate (Mtx) on the
expression of HMGB1. These drugs promoted signiﬁcantly
enhanced expression of HMGB1 in the human osteosarcoma
cell lines, MG-63, SaOS-2, and U-2 OS (Fig. 1A). Moreover, this
effect was time dependent in the case of cisplatin in cell lines
(Fig. 1B). In addition, a protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Chx) inhibited chemotherapy-induced HMGB1 protein expression (Fig. 1C). Real-time PCR revealed that HMGB1
mRNA was increased after treatment with these anticancer
agents (Fig. 1D). These ﬁndings show that HMGB1 is upregulated during chemotherapy in osteosarcoma cells.
Suppression of HMGB1 increases sensitivity to
chemotherapy in vitro
To explore the potential role for HMGB1 in the regulation of
cell death in osteosarcoma cells, a target-speciﬁc shRNA from
Sigma against HMGB1 was transfected into MG-63 and SaOS-2
cells. HMGB1 shRNA transfection led to a signiﬁcant decrease
of both HMGB1 protein and mRNA in these cells (Fig. 2A).
Knockdown of HMGB1 expression in these cells rendered them
signiﬁcantly more sensitive to doxorubicin-, cisplatin-, and
methotrexate-induced cell injury (Fig. 2B) and this was associated with high levels of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2C) and an
increase in cleaved PARP (Fig. 2D). Cleavage of PARP facilitates
cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing
apoptosis. Moreover, these anticancer agents induced the
activation of the proapoptotic protein caspase 3 to a greater
extent after HMGB1 knockdown (Fig. 2E). Moreover, addition

232

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

of the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK reversed the
increased caspase 3 activity (Fig. 2E). In addition, knockdown
of HMGB1 in MG-63 cells by another HMGB1 shRNA from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology also increased sensitivity to anticancer agent–induced cell injury and apoptosis (Fig. 2F). These
data suggest that HMGB1 increases the resistance of osteosarcoma cells to a variety of cytotoxic agents.
Overexpression of HMGB1 increases resistance to
chemotherapy in vitro
To further characterize the role of HMGB1 in osteosarcoma
cells after chemotherapy, we transfected MG-63 and SaOS-2
osteosarcoma cells with full-length human HMGB1 cDNA
(Fig. 3A). These HMGB1-overexpressing cells became resistant
to apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate (Fig. 3B), conﬁrming a potential antiapoptotic role for
HMGB1 in osteosarcoma cells. Autophagy and apoptosis are at
times triggered by common upstream signals and can result in
both initiation of both processes simultaneously (26). Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is widely used to
measure autophagy (21). Overexpression of HMGB1 increased
LC3 puncta formation after chemotherapy treatment (Fig. 3B).
To explore whether autophagy mediates the effects of HMGB1mediated resistance to the apoptotic response after treatment
with anticancer agents, we knocked down PI3KC3, Beclin 1,
and Atg7 (Fig. 3C), which are critical autophagic regulators in
mammalian cells. Silencing of these genes in MG-63 cells
inhibited HMGB1 overexpression–induced LC3-II formation
and prevented autophagic p62 degradation (Fig. 3C). Baﬁlomycin A1, an inhibitor of late phase autophagy (21), increased
overexpression of HMGB1-induced LC3-II expression, whereas
3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of early-phase autophagy (21),
inhibited overexpression of HMGB1-induced LC3-II expression

osteosarcoma cells were treated

and Mtx (50 mmol/L) for 24 hours and
then apoptosis was analyzed by
measuring positive percentage of
Annexin V cells in ﬂow cytometry
(C; n ¼ 3;  , P < 0.05), cleaved PARP
was analyzed by Western blotting
(D). E, indicated MG-63 and SaOS-2
cells were treated with Dox (0.2mg/
mL), Cis (20 mmol/L), and Mtx
(50 mmol/L) for 24 hours with or
without ZVAD-FMK (20 mmol/L) and
then the activation of caspase 3 was
analyzed (n ¼ 3;  , P < 0.05). F, MG-63
cells were transfected with control
shRNA and HMGB1 shRNA (Santa

then treated with Dox (0.2mg/mL), Cis
(20 mmol/L), and Mtx (50 mmol/L) for
24 hours. Cell viability was analyzed
by CCK-8 kit, and apoptosis was
analyzed by measuring Annexin
V–positive cells by ﬂow cytometry
(n ¼ 3;  , P < 0.05).

(Fig. 3D). This ﬁnding suggests that overexpression of
HMGB1 increases LC3 turnover but does not impair degradation of LC3. Moreover, silencing of these genes reversed
HMGB1-induced protection against chemotherapy (Fig. 3E)
accompanied by decreased autophagy (Fig. 3F) and increased
apoptosis (Fig. 3G). These ﬁndings suggest that autophagy is
required for this HMGB1-mediated antiapoptotic effect.
HMGB1 regulates autophagy during chemotherapy in
osteosarcoma cells
To explore whether HMGB1 regulates autophagy in osteosarcoma cells, we detected LC3-I to LC3-II conversion
by immunoblot analysis or LC3 puncta formation by ﬂuorescent imaging analysis. Knockdown of HMGB1 inhibited
chemotherapy-induced expression of LC3-II (Fig. 4A). When
autophagosomes form, LC3 is lipidated and recruited to the
autophagosomal membrane. Accumulation of LC3-II is
observed in the presence of baﬁlomycin A1 (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of HMGB1 inhibited accumulation of LC3 puncta in

www.aacrjournals.org

osteosarcoma cells by LC3 antibody or mRFP-GFP-LC3
construct (Fig. 4B). Moreover, ultrastructural analysis
revealed that HMGB1 shRNA cells exhibited few autophagosomes during chemotherapy compared with control shRNA
cells (Fig. 4C). To further investigate whether HMGB1 inﬂuences autophagic ﬂux, we evaluated the expression of
SQSTM1/sequestosome 1 (p62), which forms protein aggregates that are degraded by autophagy (27, 28). Indeed,
knockdown of HMGB1 inhibited autophagic p62 degradation (Fig. 4A). These ﬁndings support a critical role for
HMGB1 in the regulation of autophagy in osteosarcoma
cells. Rapamycin induces autophagy by inhibiting the protein mTOR. Consistently with previous studies (29, 30),
rapamycin pretreatment protected against doxorubicininduced apoptosis in HMGB1 wild-type cells (Fig. 4D).
However, rapamycin conferred less protection in HMGB1
knockdown cells due to diminished autophagic capacity
(Fig. 4E). These ﬁndings suggest that HMGB1 is an important regulator of autophagy-mediated cell survival.

HMGB1 regulates formation of Beclin 1–PI3KC3 complex
but not ULK1–mAtg13–FIP200 complex in autophagy
The process of mammalian autophagy is divided into several
principal steps: initiation, nucleation, elongation, closure, maturation, and ﬁnally degradation or extrusion (7). These steps
are themselves mediated by a core family of proteins—the ATG
proteins (31). To explore the potential mechanism of HMGB1mediated autophagy, we ﬁrst analyzed the early autophagic
signaling event of ULK1 complex formation. ULK1 is essential
for autophagy induction and is comprised of a large complex
that includes a mammalian homologue of Atg13 (mAtg13) and
the scaffold protein, FIP200 (an orthologue of yeast Atg17).
Knockdown of HMGB1 does not affect formation of ULK1–
mAtg13–FIP200 complex and phosphorylation of ULK1 at
Ser55 following doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 5A). However,
HMGB1 knockdown does inﬂuence the formation of the Beclin
1–PI3KC3 complex (Fig. 5B), which mediates vesicle nucleation
in autophagy. Consistent with previous studies (14, 32), endogenous HMGB1 formed a complex with Beclin1 which was
detected by coimmunoprecipitation in osteosarcoma cells
(Fig. 5C). Moreover, knockdown of ULK1 or FIP200 inhibited
the interaction between HMGB1 and Beclin 1 (Fig. 5C) and

234

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

increased sensitivity to anticancer agent–induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 5D). These studies suggest that HMGB1 is a downstream signal from ULK1–mAtg13–FIP200 complex formation
and facilitates autophagy in osteosarcoma cells by interacting
with Beclin 1. Inhibition of this pathway in autophagy will
increase drug sensitivity.
Suppression of HMGB1 increases sensitivity to
chemotherapy in vivo
To test whether targeted knockdown of HMGB1 also
increased sensitivity to chemotherapy in vivo, we inoculated
NOD/SCID mice with MG-63 tumor cells that had previously
been transfected with HMGB1-speciﬁc shRNA. Beginning at
day 7, mice were treated with doxorubicin. The growth of
HMGB1 knockdown tumor cells was signiﬁcantly inhibited
compared with control shRNA–transfected tumors after treatment (Fig. 6A). We observed that tumor cells transfected with
HMGB1-speciﬁc shRNA showed decreased autophagy and
increased apoptosis in vivo in response to therapy compared
with control shRNA-transfected tumor cells (Fig. 6B and C).
Together, these results show that HMGB1 is important in
modulating drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vivo.

Discussion
Many osteosarcoma patients develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs, and this phenomenon has been attributed to
different mechanisms including dysfunctional membrane
transport, resistance to apoptosis, and the persistence of stem
cell–like tumor cells. In this study, we showed that HMGB1mediated autophagy is a signiﬁcant contributor to drug resistance in osteosarcoma. Inhibition of HMGB1 or autophagy
increased the drug sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells.
HMGB1 is a nonhistone chromatin protein that acts as a
damage associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP) when
released into the extracellular milieu (33). As a redox sensitive
protein, HMGB1 has been implicated as an important factor in
both sterile inﬂammation and infection as well as in cancer,
diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases (5, 34). HMGB1 is a

www.aacrjournals.org

bone active cytokine and regulates the bone microenvironment (35, 36). For example, HMGB1 acts as a chemotactic
agent to osteoclasts and osteoblasts during endochondral
ossiﬁcation (36). Overexpression of HMGB1 is associated with
each of the hallmarks of cancer including unlimited mitosis,
the ability to recruit new vascular structures, evasion of
programmed cell death (apoptosis), avoiding immune destruction, self-sufﬁciency in growth signals, insensitivity to inhibitors of growth, tumor-promoting inﬂammation, dysregulation
of cellular energetics, genome instability and mutation, and
tissue invasion and metastasis (37–39).
One of the mechanisms by which chemotherapeutics
destroy cancer cells is by inducing cell death. We found that
doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate promote enhanced
expression of HMGB1 in human osteosarcoma cells. Moreover,
knockdown of HMGB1 by shRNA increased cell death and

addition, HMGB1 is also a negative regulator of drug-induced
cell death in other tumors such as leukemia (16), colon cancer
(17) and prostate cancer (40). As a DAMP, release of HMGB1 by
dead and dying cells triggers inﬂammation (41) and the
immune response (4). Thus, release of HMGB1 by dying tumor
cells is helpful to host dendritic cells which process and present
tumor antigens to immune effector cells (42). In addition to the

extracellular release HMGB1, its redox status is critical to
regulating cell death and survival in cancer cells. Reduced
exogenous HMGB1 protein promotes cell survival, whereas
oxidized HMGB1 induces apoptosis (17).
Cancer cells respond to chemotherapy in a variety of ways
ranging from the activation of survival pathways to the initiation of cell death. Increased autophagy is observed in osteosarcoma cells when exposed to chemotherapy drugs (43, 44).

HMGB1 and Osteosarcoma

In general, autophagy is a "programmed cell survival" mechanism because cells using autophagy to prevent the accumulation of damaged or unnecessary components, but also functions to facilitate the recycling of these components to sustain
homoeostasis. We found that inhibition of autophagy increases
osteosarcoma cell death and reverses HMGB1-mediated drug
resistance. Recently, a systematic chemical study on cells
exposed to 1,400 compounds showed that no single cytotoxic
agent can induce cell death by autophagy (45), conﬁrming that
autophagy is mostly a cytoprotective mechanism (8). Thus,
autophagic cell death may be a misnomer (46).
It has been reported that HMGB1 is a critical regulator of
autophagy. Cytosolic HMGB1 is an inducer of starvationmediated autophagy by binding to Beclin 1 in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts and colon cancer cells (14). In addition,
reduced extracellular HMGB1 induces autophagy through the
receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) in colon
and pancreatic cancer cells (17). Furthermore, nuclear HMGB1
regulates HSPB1 gene expression (15). Phosphorylation of
HSPB1 is necessary for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton,
which mediates the vesicular transport required for autophagy
in response to mitochondrial injury. Here, we found that
knockdown of HMGB1 decreased LC3 II levels, LC3 puncta
formation, and p62 degradation which was associated with a
decreased number of membraned autophagosomes by
detected by TEM in osteosarcoma cells. Notably, we showed
that the ULK1–FIP200 complex is required for the interaction
between HMGB1 and Beclin 1, which then promotes Beclin
1–PI3KC3 complex formation. However, the assembly of the

Beclin 1 complexes is complex and seems to differ in a cell- or
tissue-dependent fashion (47). AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) is a key molecular player in energy homeostasis and is
important for the activation of ULK1 (48). It is unknown
whether AMPK and other kinases are involved in the regulation
of the interaction between HMGB1 and Beclin 1.
In conclusion, we showed that chemotherapy-induced
HMGB1 expression in osteosarcoma cells promoted autophagy, which inhibited apoptosis and increased drug resistance.
Our in vitro and in vivo xenograft studies showed that suppression of HMGB1 expression signiﬁcantly increased drug
sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells. Thus, we believe these data
support an investigation of HMGB1 as a strategic target for
osteosarcoma therapy.
