Hepatoblastoma, Cisplatin, and
Ototoxicity
Good News on Deaf Ears
Michael J. Sullivan, MB, ChB, PhD

Hepatoblastoma, like several other solid tumors in children, is a good-news story: good news for
the spectacular improvement in survival for hepatoblastoma achieved over the past 30 to 40 years and also
good news for the manner in which this was achieved the remarkable level of collaboration by several
international cooperative clinical trials groups. Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant embryonal tumor of
the liver that occurs in young infants with a median age at diagnosis of 16 months.1 With an age-adjusted
frequency of 1.2 per million children aged 15 years, hepatoblastoma accounts for 1% of new cancer diagnoses in childhood.2 Ironically, it is the very rarity of hepatoblastoma that may have contributed to its
improved clinical outcome. Most pediatric oncology units, which treat between 50 and 150 new cases of
childhood cancer per year, will only diagnose 1 new case of hepatoblastoma per year or even less. However,
the treatment of a malignant liver tumor in a young infant requires a special level of interdisciplinary collaboration between oncologists, diagnostic radiology and pathology, and surgeons to ensure the best possible outcome. Seeking an improved outcome fostered the development of the first collaborative clinical
trials for infants with hepatoblastoma and, in doing so, has provided healthcare professionals with a clear
roadmap for the care of a rare malignant tumor based on the best available evidence.
In 1982, Evans et al reported what to our knowledge was the first collaborative trials for childhood liver
tumors. After the first chemotherapy trial, in which a 17% survival rate was achieved, a second study of 62
patients (Children’s Cancer Group [CCG]/Pediatric Oncology Group [POG], 1976-1978) who received postoperative vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and 5-flurouracil achieved a 30% survival rate and demonstrated for the first time that hepatoblastoma is a chemosensitive tumor.3 A later nonrandomized CCG trial
(CCG 823. 1986-1989) used cisplatin and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) for unresectable and metastatic hepatoblastoma and achieved 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rates of 55% and 30%, respectively.4 A similar study
from the POG that used cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine (C5V) achieved a similar 3-year EFS rate.5
Although later treatment approaches varied, subsequent cooperative clinical trials from the Intergroup Hepatoma Study, the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH), and the International Society
of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) Liver Tumor Study Group (SIOPEL) all produced dramatic improvements in overall
survival for hepatoblastoma; and central to that success was the use chemotherapy regimens that incorporated cisplatin. The Intergroup Study INT-0098 (1989-1992) of postoperative C5V or combined cisplatin and doxorubicin

produced a 3-year overall survival rate of 71%; and a similar
rate was produced in the German GPOH HB99 study,
which used postoperative chemotherapy with combined
ifosfamide, cisplatin, and doxorubicin.6,7
The first SIOP Liver Tumor trial, SIOPEL 1 (19901994), enrolled 155 patients to receive preoperative treatment with cisplatin and doxorubicin and achieved a 5year overall survival rate of 75%.1 In SIOPEL 2, 1 arm of
a risk-adapted strategy evaluated single-agent cisplatin
given preoperatively for standard-risk tumors and
achieved an impressive 3-year overall survival rate of
91%.8 The change from a largely fatal malignant tumor
to a mostly curable tumor using single-agent cisplatin and
expert surgery is a remarkable outcome.
However, cure comes at a cost. Cisplatin, which is
used widely in the treatment of childhood solid tumors
(notably, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumors, osteosarcoma,
medulloblastoma, and hepatoblastoma), causes measurable hearing loss in 25% to 90% of children.9
Risk factors for ototoxicity include preexisting hearing loss, young age, cumulative cisplatin dose (300 mg/
m2), dose schedule, coexisting renal dysfunction, and prior
cranial radiotherapy, especially when the cochlea is within
the radiation field.9,10 Hearing loss is particularly marked
in young children, especially those aged 5 years, who have a
relative risk of significant hearing loss that is 20-fold greater
than that for an individual aged 20 years who receives the
same cisplatin dose.10 Moreover, for very young, preverbal
infants, the impact of measurable hearing loss maybe
greatly underestimated, because cisplatin has its greatest
impact in the high and very high frequency ranges of hearing: the same frequency range that very young children
depend on as they acquire language, develop social skills,
and enter structured learning environments.9
However, not all children of the same age who receive
the same cumulative cisplatin dose experience hearing loss,
suggesting that genetic factors are involved. Indeed, the risk
of cisplatin hearing impairment is associated with specific
genotypes of glutathione S-transferase.11
Other platins (notably, carboplatin) are less ototoxic
than cisplatin but maybe less effective; therefore, despite the
high risk of ototoxicity, cisplatin remains the agent of choice
for hepatoblastoma and many other childhood solid tumors
for the foreseeable future. Seeking to prevent a lifetime of
treatment-related deafness, several recent trials have evaluated new agents aimed at reducing ototoxicity.

In this issue, Katzenstein et al report the hearing outcomes of a randomized trial of amifostine for reducing
platin-associated toxicity, most notably cisplatin-related
ototoxicity. In their Intergroup Hepatoblastoma study
(P9645),12 120 patients were randomized to treatment,
depending on disease stage, to either 4 cycles of C5V or 6
cycles of cisplatin and carboplatin (cumulative cisplatin
dose of 400-600 mg/m2), with or without amifostine.
Available data for 82 randomized patients were evaluated
for hearing loss using modified Brock criteria.
Amifostine is an aminothiol prodrug that is dephosphorylated rapidly to an active thiol. In normal tissues, it
acts as a reactive oxygen scavenger and also covalently binds
cisplatin.13,14 Originally developed as a radiation protectant, encouraging data from animal studies led to several
clinical trials in adults and children to assess its effectiveness
in preventing cisplatin ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.14
Although several early adult studies demonstrated efficacy against platin-related toxicity, in their current study,
Katzenstein et al demonstrate that amifostine did not protect against any level of detectable hearing loss compared
with controls. This result is in keeping with several smaller
studies in children in which amifostine did not prevent cisplatin-related hearing loss in osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma,
or germ cell tumors.15-17 However, in a recent study of 97
children with medulloblastoma, Fouladi et al demonstrated
that amifostine significantly reduced severe hearing loss in
patients who received craniospinal radiotherapy and doseintense, cisplatin-based chemotherapy.18
However, several crucial differences are apparent
between these 2 recent amifostine trials. First, the cumulative amifostine dosing and dose schedules differed: Katzenstein et al used a single dose of amifostine immediately
before cisplatin in their hepatoblastoma study, whereas
Fouladi et al gave an additional bolus dose of amifostine
after 3 hours of the cisplatin infusion to their patients
with medulloblastoma. Second, all patients with medulloblastoma received craniospinal radiotherapy, which itself
is ototoxic and also is a known contributor to cisplatinrelated hearing loss, whereas patients in the hepatoblastoma study (and in other solid tumor studies) received cisplatin-based chemotherapy alone. Third, the patients who
had hepatoblastoma were significantly younger (median
age, 1 year) compared with the patients who had medulloblastoma (median age, 8 years). and younger age carries a
greater risk of more severe cisplatin-related hearing loss.

Finally, the assessment of hearing and the classification of
hearing loss were not comparable between the 2 studies.
Although amifostine may play a role in reducing
ototoxicity in older children who are treated with cisplatin
and craniospinal radiotherapy, it has no benefit in preventing cisplatin hearing loss in the very young, and those
patients are at the greatest risk of hearing loss and in greatest need of preserving their hearing for their future development. However, several newer agents that currently are
entering clinical trials may reduce cisplatin-related toxicity, and specifically ototoxicity.13,14
Cisplatin ototoxicity results from the production of
reactive oxygen species within the cochlea, overwhelming
endogenous antioxidant mechanisms and causing irreversible free–radical-related apoptosis of cochlea outer hair
cells, spiral ganglion cells, and the stria vascularis.14 In
animal studies, cisplatin exposure to cochlea outer hair
cell induces the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphatase (NADPH) oxidase 3, which catalyzes superoxide synthesis and activates the intrinsic
mitochondrial apoptosis cascade, resulting in caspase 3induced and caspase 9-induced cell death. In the cochlea
lateral wall and stria vascularis, cisplatin exposure leads to
the activation of nuclear factor B and the formation of
nitric oxide (NO) by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) with
the induction of caspase 3-related apoptosis. While in the
spiral ganglion, cisplatin induces high mobility group 1
protein expression, which also leads to iNOS-related
apoptosis.13,14,19
In principle, preventing cisplatin-related hearing
loss requires agents that are capable of selectively protecting cochlea cells from apoptotic cell death while not
preventing tumor-related apoptosis. For practical reasons, local chemoprotectant therapy administered
directly into the inner ear is unlikely to be used in very
young children.
However, several systemic agents have been identified recently as candidates for preventing cisplatin-related
ototoxicity. The most promising is sodium thiosulfate
(STS), which, similar to amifostine, is a free–radical-scavenging thiol agent.19 In vitro, STS acts in several ways: it
directly inactivates cisplatin by the covalent binding of cisplatin to its thiol moiety to form an inactive complex, it
scavenges cisplatin-related reactive oxygen species, and it
may concentrate in the perilymph or endolymph, further
inactivating cisplatin in the inner ear.14,19,20

Recently, SIOPEL (including the German
GPOH, the Japanese Study Group for Pediatric Liver
Tumors, and several US centers) opened the first large
randomized trial of STS (SIOPEL 6) to reduce the burden of ototoxicity in children with hepatoblastoma.
That phase 3 trial will enroll 250 children with standard-risk hepatoblastoma for preoperative treatment
with single-agent cisplatin or cisplatin and STS, and
the STS will be given as a delayed infusion 6 hours after
cisplatin infusion to rescue cisplatin ototoxicity without compromising antitumor activity. A standardized
approach to the evaluation of ototoxicity has been
developed for the study. Secondary objectives of SIOPEL 6 will evaluate nephrotoxicity and investigate
genetic loci associated with cisplatin ototoxicity. In a
parallel study, the Children’s Oncology Group
recently activated a randomized phase 3 clinical trial
(ACCL0431) to evaluate the efficacy of STS for preventing cisplatin-related hearing loss in newly diagnosed children with hepatoblastoma, germ cell tumors,
medulloblastoma, and osteosarcoma.21
However, even the most thoroughly conducted
and controlled collaborative studies are only as good as
the data available to report. In the study reported here
by Katzenstein et al, 120 patients with hepatoblastoma
made up the evaluation cohort, but 30% of those
patients (n 38) had to be excluded from the analysis
because of incomplete audiologic or clinical data.
There is a need for future ototoxicity trials to use
common criteria for the assessment and reporting of
hearing loss in young children, as Katzenstein et al
observe.
This represents a significant challenge for the design
and comparison of future international collaborative studies in which toxicity reduction is the measurable endpoint.
There is a message in this. In the past, when the goal was
to assess treatment response and improve survival, data
quality has rarely been an issue. However, the goalposts
now have shifted to enhancing long-term survival, and
with this comes the need to ensure that the study design
and measurement of long-term toxicity, such as hearing
loss, become equally valued objectives.
