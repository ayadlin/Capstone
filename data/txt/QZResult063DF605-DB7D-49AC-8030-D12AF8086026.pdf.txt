ABSTRACT
Metastasis accounts for the high mortality rate associated with colorectal
cancer (CRC), but metastasis regulators are not fully understood. To identify a
novel gene involved in tumor metastasis, we used oligonucleotide microarrays,
transcriptome distance analyses, and machine learning algorithms to determine
links between primary and metastatic colorectal cancers. Aminopeptidase A (APA;
also known as ENPEP) was selected as our focus because its relationship with
colorectal cancer requires clarification. Higher APA mRNA levels were observed in
patients in advanced stages of cancer, suggesting a correlation between ENPEP
and degree of malignancy. Our data also indicate that APA overexpression in CRC
cells induced cell migration, invasion, anchorage-independent capability, and
mesenchyme-like characteristics (e.g., EMT markers). We also observed TWIST
induction in APA-overexpressing SW480 cells and TWIST down-regulation in HT29
cells knocked down with APA. Both APA silencing and impaired APA activity were
found to reduce migratory capacity, cancer anchorage, stemness properties, and
drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. We therefore suggest that APA enzymatic
activity affects tumor initiation and cancer malignancy in a TWIST-dependent
manner. Results from RT-qPCR and the immunohistochemical staining of specimens
taken from CRC patients indicate a significant correlation between APA and TWIST.
According to data from SurvExpress analyses of TWIST1 and APA mRNA expression
profiles, high APA and TWIST expression are positively correlated with poor CRC
prognosis. APA may act as a prognostic factor and/or therapeutic target for CRC
metastasis and recurrence.

INTRODUCTION

in different cancers—for example, promoting cell
proliferation via the angiotensin II-AT1 axis in human
prostate cancer [16] and in choriocarcinomas [17]. Others
have described APA up-regulation in uterine cervix
neoplastic lesions [18].
However, few efforts have been made to clarify the
influence of APA on tumor progression mechanisms, or the
functional role of APA in colorectal cancer. The primary
motivations for the present study are understanding how
APA performs its oncogenic role, and taking steps toward
identifying one or more possible metastasis promotion
mechanisms. The novel CRC metastasis-related gene
that we identified may serve as a useful CRC diagnostic
marker and/or therapeutic target.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most
diagnosed cancer in females and third in males worldwide.
CRC incidence rates, which are rapidly increasing in
many countries, are associated with risk factors such as
unhealthy diet, smoking and obesity [1]. Studies have
shown that nearly 43% of colon cancer patients developed
liver metastases and 25% of CRC patients had both liver
and lung metastases, with a five-year stage IV survival rate
of less than 10% [2, 3]. Accordingly, the early detection of
metastasis-associated genes may increase the lifespans of
CRC patients.
Cancer-related epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) is one of the most important mechanisms
accounting for initial metastatic development [4].
Transdifferentiation is stimulated by cancerous
microenvironments and triggered by transcription
factors (TFs) such as SNAI1 (snail), SNAI2 (slug),
the zinc-finger E-box-binding (ZEB) family, TWIST1
and TWIST2, among others [5]. EMT-related TFs are
associated with cancer stemness properties [6]. Cancer
cell mesenchymal phenotypes are linked with metastasis
and stem-like properties. For example, circulating tumor
cells (CTCs) express mesenchymal markers such as
vimentin, TWIST and N-cadherin, and stem cell markers
such as CD133high, ALDH1high and CD44high/CD24low [7,
8]. Combined, the evidence suggests that malignant cell
invasion and dissemination occurs via EMT-mediated
de-differentiation, with a change in self-renewal function
to achieve colonization via re-differentiation at distant
metastatic sites. Another factor in metastasis involves
cancer stem cells (CSCs)—a minor population of
malignant cancer cells with significant capabilities for selfrenewal, differentiation, and therapy resistance that are
strongly correlated with tumor recurrence [9]. Molecules
that promote CSC generation in EMT or metastatic
processes in CRC are still poorly understood.
Evidence from the high-throughput genomics
process used for this study indicate the elevated
expression of a unique gene, ENPEP, in metastatic
colorectal carcinomas compared to in situ primary
tumors. Glutamyl aminopeptidase—EC 3.4.11.7, also
known as aminopeptidase A (APA), gp160, and CD249
[10]—is a type II transmembrane zinc metallopeptidase
of the M1 family encoded by the ENPEP gene [11]. APA
is abundantly expressed in the brush borders of the small
intestine, renal glomeruli, and proximal renal tubules
of early B-lineage cells collected from mice [12]. This
ectopeptidase cleaves N-terminal glutamatic and aspartatic
amino acid residues from polypeptide substrates such as
angiotensin (Ang) II, cholecytokinin-8 (CCK8) in vitro,
and neurokinin B [13, 14]. APA enzymatic activity is
modulated by Ca2+ and brain renin–angiotensin system
(RAS) homeostasis by converting Ang II to Ang III [15].
Several research teams have described APA involvement

RESULTS
Elevated expression of Aminopeptidase A
(ENPEP) with CRC disease progression and cell
mobility in vitro
The ENPEP gene was selected from 157 genes
with significantly different expression patterns in
overlapping microarray data sets consisting of normal,
tumorous and metastatic samples (Supplementary Figure
1a). Results from a gene ontology analysis to predict an
APA biologic function tree indicate a link between APA
and cell migration (Supplementary Figure 1b). We found
that APA mRNA levels were significantly elevated in
stage III and liver metastasis tissue samples compared to
stage I samples (Figure 1A). According to these results,
a significant correlation exists between APA expression
and cancer progression. We used Western blotting to
compare endogenous APA expression levels in four
cell lines: SW480 (Dukes B), SW620 (Dukes C), HT29
(Dukes C) and HCT116 (Dukes D). Results indicate a
correlation between APA protein levels and tumor grading
sequences in SW480, SW620 and HT29 only (Figure
1B). This finding, which is consistent with our data for
ENPEP mRNA levels in stage IV patients suggests that
APA affects both Dukes B and Dukes C cells.
Due to their inclination toward lower APA expression,
SW480 cells were chosen for APA overexpression. To
assess the effects of APA overexpression on cell migration,
we performed transient transfection and used Western
blots to detect APA protein levels (Figure 1C, left). Results
indicate increased migration and invasion activity in APAoverexpressing cells compared to vector control cells
(Figure 1C, right). During cell motion, cells with high
motility expressed actin or microtubule polymerization and
lamellipodium protrusion [19]. This confirmed the effect of
APA on the protrusive force of migration by enhancing actin
filament polymerization at the leading edge. Stable APAoverexpressing SW480 and HT29 cell lines were established
by lentiviral transduction (Supplementary Figure 1c) and
subjected to immunofluorescence staining assays. As shown
21267

in Figure 1D, APA overexpression increased the formation
of fluorescence-labeled filamentous F-actin, lamellipodia,
and filopodia microspikes, thus contributing to elongated
cell shapes. Next, we looked at the potential of APA
overexpression to promote malignancy in vitro. Results from
a soft agar analysis indicate (a) that the number of colonies
increased in SW480 APA-overexpressing cells (Figure
1E, left), and (b) compared to a vector control, a colony
breadth advantage exists in terms of anchorage-independent
growth (Figure 1E, right). These data support our hypothesis
regarding APA participation in CRC tumorigenesis and
metastasis.

key molecules such as Snail, Slug and TWIST [20]. As
shown in Figure 2A, E-cadherin (CDH1) and vimentin
(VIM) mRNA levels revealed a mesenchymal phenotype
in SW480 APA-overexpressing cells compared to a
vector control. Primary EMT regulator expression was
determined by Western blots (Figure 2B). Results indicate
significant upregulation of the TWIST but not the Slug
protein during APA overexpression. We also observed a
two-fold increase of TWIST promoter activity in APAoverexpressing SW480 cells compared to a vector control
(Figure 2C).
Next, we looked at whether APA inhibition
downregulated TWIST expression. In HT29 cells, we
found that the APA knockdown process significantly
reduced TWIST expression in terms of both mRNA and
protein levels (Figure 2D), while concurrently attenuating
cell motility (Figure 2E). Further, TWIST1 mRNA
increased as APA mRNA levels increased—a finding that
was also applicable to our clinical CRC specimens (Figure

upregulating TWIST expression in both CRC cell lines
and clinical specimens, thus promoting tumor progression
and motility.

indicate spheroid formation in APA-overexpressing cells
starting on day 5 (Supplementary Figure 2a). Integral
spheroids were clearly observed on day 9 (Figure 3B,
upper), and spheroid numbers increased significantly
in APA-overexpressing SW480 cells after three weeks
(Figure 3B, lower). In contrast, APA knockdown in HT29
cells reduced their ability to form intact circular spheroids
(Figure 3C, left and Supplementary Figure 2b). Further,
the number of primary- and secondary-seeded spheroid
cells in APA-knocked down HT29 cells decreased
significantly (Figure 3C middle and right and Figure 3D).
ALDH1 activity has been reported as a reliable index of
CRC stem cells [21], and ALDH1 expression in CRC
is strongly associated with and dependent on TWIST
expression [22]. Our flow cytometry data show that
CD44+ and ALDH+ cell populations significantly declined
in APA-knocked down HT29 cells (Figure 3E and Figure
3F), suggesting that CSC-like characteristics are enhanced
by APA expression.

Aminopeptidase A-induced cancer cell stemness
via TWIST regulation
TWIST has been shown to promote tumor initiation
and cancer stem cell properties during the EMT process
[6]. We therefore used qRT-PCR to analyze stemness
and relative gene expression (Nanog, c-MYC, Oct-4 and
Sox2) in both APA and vector-only transfectants (Figure
3A). Our data indicate that APA transfectants expressed
a higher number of stemness genes. Inherent stemness
traits can be enriched under serum-free spheroid culture
conditions—the spheroids that are formed reflect the selfrenewal capability of stem cells or cancerous stem-like
cells. Observations during serum-free spheroid culturing

Aminopeptidase A mutation at metabolic activity
site impairs cell mobility and CSC properties

APAmut compared to SW480-APA cells and the vector
control (Figure 4C).
We attempted to determine the importance of APA
enzymatic activity for TWIST regulation and TWISTinduced phenotypes in cancer cells. Immunoblotting
assay results show that the APA mutation significantly
downregulated TWIST expression in SW480 cells
(Figure 4D). We found that APA overexpression increased
the number of cell colonies, but APA mutants formed
smaller numbers of colonies in SW480 cells (Figure 4E,
upper). Drug resistance (the primary reason for treatment
failure) is characteristic of cancer stem-like cells [25].
Our data indicate that cells overexpressing APA but not
APAmut showed greater resistance to 5-FU-induced
growth inhibition compared to the vector control (Figure
4E, lower). Combined, these data suggest that APA
peptidase activity is vital for APA-induced cell motility,
cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and cancer stemness
properties.

The CPRECESIC peptide specifically inhibits APA
enzymatic activity [23]. In the present study we found
that APA enzymatic activity was inhibited by treatment
with 1 mM of the CPRECESIC peptide in SW480-APA
cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Results from woundhealing assays indicate reduced cell motility following the
inhibition of APA activity. A negative charge for aspartatic
acid 221 is considered essential for the Ca2+ modulation of
human APA enzymatic activity [24]. To determine whether
the loss of APA activity exerted a negative effect on
metastasis, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct
two human APA mutants with D221A substitutions: pFlagAPAmut and pLAS3w.Ppuro-APAmut. APA enzymatic
activity in vector and SW480-APAmut cells were almost
undetectable, even after 60 min (Figure 4B). The number
of migratory cells decreased significantly in SW480-

APA-regulated TWIST expression via NF-κB
translocation

TWIST knockdown in APA-overexpressing cells
minimizes cell motion and CSC-like properties
induced by enzymatic activity

To maintain EMT phenotype and cancer
malignancy, the NF-κB pathway mediates several
EMT-TFs, including Snail, Slug, TWIST, Sip1, ZEB1
and ZEB2 [26, 27]. In breast cancer, activated NF-κB
p65 binds to a TWIST promoter and triggers EMT by
inducing TWIST expression [28]. We therefore tried
to determine whether a NFκB-TWIST1 signaling
axis exists in APA-induced EMT, and found that NFκB reporter activity was significantly upregulated in
APA-overexpressed SW480 cells (Figure 5A). We also
confirmed that APA induced NF-κB p65 translocation
to the cell nucleus, and enhanced TWIST expression
in nuclear fractions (Figure 5B). According to these
results, TWIST regulation by APA is dependent on NFκB signaling activation.

To confirm that the effects of cell motility were
mediated by TWIST due to APA overexpression, TWIST
expression was knocked down in APA-overexpressing
SW480 cells. Western blot results show that vimentin
levels decreased in both APAmut and APA-/TWIST1
knockdown cells (APA/shTWIST1#1 and #2) (Figure
5C). Similar to APAmut-overexpressing cells, TWIST
knockdown in APA-overexpressing SW480 cells
significantly reduced cell migration ability (Figure 5D).
Further, sphere formation assay results confirm that
spheroid numbers decreased markedly following TWIST1
knockdown—a finding that is in agreement with reduced
mRNA levels in stemness genes (Figure 5F and Figure
5E). Combined, the evidence indicates that APA-enhanced

that orthotopic CT26 tumor size increased noticeably in
the APA-overexpressing group compared to the vector
control group (Supplementary Figure 4).
According to these findings, APA expression and
activity are important factors in CRC tumor formation.
However, any clinical correlation between APA-plusTWIST and patient outcomes remains unclear. To
determine the prognostic significance of this potential
correlation, we used IHC to analyze APA-TWIST coexpression in colorectal cancer samples, and found (a)
significantly higher levels of APA and TWIST protein in
tumor tissue compared to paired normal tissue (Figure 6C)
and (b) large elevations of TWIST expression in nuclear
bases associated with upregulated APA in tumor stroma
(Figure 6D, upper). Results from double positive (59.4%)
and double negative (63.9%) staining indicate a significant
relationship between APA and TWIST (P <0.05), as
calculated by a Pearson’s chi-squared analysis (Figure
6D, lower). We increased the number of patient specimens
to 105 for a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and found
that patients with higher levels of APA expression had

APA expression affects patient prognoses and
tumorigenesis in vivo
To study the effects of APA on tumorigenicity,
HT29-shLuc and HT29-shAPA cells were injected
subcutaneously into nude mice. Data indicate that the
tumorigenic capacity of APA knockdown cells decreased
significantly compared to control cells (Figure 6A).
Xenograft experiments were used to compare the effects
of tumorigenesis in the presence or absence of APA
enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 6B, tumor growth
decreased in the absence of APA activity. However,
previous studies have shown that the APA amino acid
sequence is 78% homologous to that of the murine
BP-1/6C3 (APA) glycoprotein [29]. Mouse APA was
overexpressed in murine colon adenocarcinoma CT26
cells and subcutaneously injected into BALB/c mice to
examine the effects of APA on tumorigenesis. We observed

significantly lower disease-free survival (DFS) and
relapse-free survival (RFS) rates (Figure 6E). The
multivariate analysis (Cox regression model) data indicate
that metastasis was an independent significant prognostic
factor for poor disease-free survival and association with
APA expression (Table 1). Last, we used a SurvExpress
online biomarker validation tool and microarray database
to look for links between cancer gene expression and
clinical outcomes, and to investigate DFS probabilities
for patients with high levels of APA/TWIST expression.
Results indicate a strong and positive link between APA/
TWIST expression and cancer risk (Figure 6F). CRC
patients experienced significant reductions in DFS with
high APA/TWIST expression (Figure 6G). Combined,
the IHC staining and microarray data suggest that APA
expression induced increases in nuclear TWIST, and that
APA is associated with poor clinical outcomes in colon
cancer patients.

cancer patients (Figures 1C, 6C and 6D). TWIST has been
described as a CRC prognostic marker for overall survival
(OS) in stage II but not stage III cases, and for DSF only
in stage I cases [30]. However, our results suggest that
CRC patient prognoses can be improved by measuring
both APA and TWIST expression levels. Specifically, the
data indicate that APA may serve as an early indicator of
CRC progression—slightly upregulated during stage I, and
significantly elevated during stage II.
One research team has reported links between
TWIST1 expression and both male hormones and advanced
malignancies due to higher levels of TWIST1 mRNA in
males compared to females [31]. To confirm this gender
link and to determine the regulating role of APA, we
separated CRC specimens according to positive/negative
APA and TWIST expression. Our data did not indicate
any gender-related statistical differences (Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2).
TWIST is a highly conserved basic helix-loophelix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in biological
development and linked to oncogenes [31]. Few efforts
have been made to determine its malignant function, if
any, in CRC. We observed significant increases in sphere
formation (6-7 fold) in TWIST-upregulated cells induced
by APA overexpression, but also found that knocked down
TWIST in APA-overexpressing CRC cells eliminated this
sphere formation capacity. According to our data, TWISTinduced stemness, which is also found in colon epithelial
cells, can profoundly affect cancer stem cell populations.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the present study is the first
analysis of APA overexpression as a mediator for increased
cell migration and cell stemness in colorectal cancer. Our
data indicate an association between cancer promotion
and APA enzymatic activity resulting in NF-κB activation
and upregulated TWIST expression. Further, our clinical
data show a positive correlation between APA expression
and both metastasis and poor prognoses for colorectal

TWIST, which is frequently overexpressed or
hypermethylated, has important implications for tumor
metastasis in colon cancer [31, 32]. It is therefore
important to understand the role of upstream TWIST
regulation in production and regulation pathways, and
how it might provide benefits in terms of early cancer
treatment [33]. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)
[34] and NF-κB [35] are dominant upstream TWIST
inducers via their physical interaction. However,
common colon cancer cell lines such as SW480 have
KRAS mutations and NF-κB signaling cascades that
are initiated by phosphati-dylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt pathways during tumorigenesis [36]. We therefore
focused on the NF-κB-TWIST axis to determine whether
TWIST upregulation by APA occurs primarily via NFκB activation. Phosphorylated AKT has been reported
as promoting NF-κB activation and TWIST expression
in hepatocellular carcinoma cells during EMT under
hypoxic conditions [37]. The data indicate a direct link
from PI3K/AKT to NF-κB and TWIST under such
conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α rapidly
degrades due to proteasomes following ubiquitination by
the pVHL complex in the presence of oxygen [38, 39].
At least one research team has demonstrated that APA is
capable of regulating HIF-1α protein stability by partly
blocking proteasomal degradation during ischemiainduced angiogenesis, and that APA expression also
increases under hypoxic conditions [40]. However, HIF1α expression in CRC patients is correlated with tumor
growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and VEGF expression
[41]. In this study we failed to clarify the relationship
between HIF-1α and APA. Additional effort is required to
determine the mechanism underlying the role of HIF-1α in
CRC APA overexpression.
In only one instance in the M1 family is enzymatic
activity regulated by Ca2+: aminopeptidase [24]. We found
that APA mutation D221A in SW480-overexpressing
cells significantly impaired cancer malignancies both
in vivo and in vitro. However, the catalytic activity of
APA is dependent on a opened conformation which
composed by the homodimer structure on head domain
[42]. The conformational change was accompanied by
positional changes of catalytic residues [43]. Increasing
APA expression on the cell membrane may increase the
catalytic activity of APA and metastasis-related substrates,
such as angiotensin III.
One other aminopeptidase associated with tumor
progression and metastasis is aminopeptidase N (APN/
CD13), which is downstream of APA in the reninangiotensin system. APN participates in angiogenesis,
tumor cell invasion, and metastasis by induced extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation [44, 45]. Previous
studies also suggesting that APN as an indicator of poor
prognosis for lymph node metastasis in colon cancer [46].
An important direction for further work might be to study
the oncogenic effects of APN in APA-overexpressing CRC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

samples. However, the conformation of catalytic cavity
on mammalian APA are significantly narrower than APN,
indicating that APN could recognize more substrates than
APA but had poorer specificity. We suggest that substrates
size of APA is relatively narrow, so that to develop specific
inhibitors for APA activity may be better for metastatic
colon cancer treated.
Further, specific APA binding motifs (e.g., the
consensus sequence CPRECESIC) acted as inhibitors of
APA activity, suppressing both VEGF-induced migration
and endothelial cell proliferation [23]—results that are
consistent with our findings for epithelial tumor cells.
Monoclonal antibody treatment is currently considered
a successful therapeutic strategy for both hematologic
malignancies and solid tumors [47]. However, acute
albuminuria and other forms of toxicity are linked to
the targeting of the APA protein using the monoclonal
antibodies ASD-37 and ASD-41 [48]. Accordingly, we are
currently working on a CPRECESIC-based compound and
a compound similar to the selective APA inhibitor (S)-3amino-4-mercaptobutylsulphonic acid (EC33) [49], which
specifically targets APA-induced CRC malignancies.
In conclusion, our results suggest a potential
biomarker for use in early diagnosis, in metastasis-related
prognosis, and as a CRC therapeutic target. It is possible
that APA represents an upstream molecule that induces
TWIST expression via NF-κB activation. The APAinduced NF-κB-TWIST pathway plays an important role
in cell invasion, tumor initiation, and drug resistance, all
of which are enzymatic activity-dependent. To date, no
one has yet identified its APA substrates, which trigger
downstream signaling associated with CRC tumorigenesis.
Further studies are needed to clarify links between APA
substrates and tumor progression signaling, which may
provide clues for the development of drugs and other
treatment modalities.

sets downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus
21275

Oncotarget

Lentivirus production and infection

(GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) were used to
determine relationships between colorectal carcinomas
(CRC) and tumor metastasis. The sets include 17 for
normal human tissues (4 Taiwanese colon samples
plus 3 colon, 7 liver, and 3 lung tissue samples from
GEO accession number GSE3526) and 236 colorectal
adenocarcinomas (from the Expression Project for
Ontology number GSE2109). In addition, 157 metastasis
signature genes were collected from 162 patients (143
primary CRC and 19 metastasis); these were generated
pre-2007 by the International Genomics Consortium
[IGC]). Another set was collected from 78 patients
(71 primary CRC patients and 7 metastasis) generated
by the IGC in 2007, plus 2 paired Taiwanese primary
and liver metastatic CRCs. To clarify the biological
function of 157 genes identified in the Gene Ontology
(GO) database (DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 2008
interface), we used a graph theory evidence-based
method to agglomerate species-specific gene or protein
identifiers.

Soft agar mixtures (1.5 ml 0.5%; 2X Medium—
L15, 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 1% glutamine, 0.5% agar,
1% penicillin-streptomycin) were held in six-well plates
for solidification. Next, 2 ml of 0.33% cell-agar mixture
were added to the bottom layer and incubated for 2
weeks at 37°C with or without 5% CO2. Colonies were
observed under a microscope; images were captured
and analyzed by MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, CA,
USA), or colonies were stained with Giemsa solution for
quantification.

RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted with a TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, MA, USA) or RNA kit (Gene Mark, Taichung,
Taiwan). Extracted RNA samples (2 μg) were used to
synthesize cDNA with a RevertAid First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green
MasterMix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and a StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Gene expression levels were normalized
to human GAPDH and analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method.
Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3. All tests
were repeated a minimum of three times, with duplicate
PCR reactions for each sample. For the experiment shown
in Figure 3F, cDNA samples were randomly selected from
a previous experiment (Figure 1A) to confirm relative
TWIST1 mRNA levels.

Clonogenic assays
To determine long-term proliferation rates under
different treatment conditions, 1 x 103 CRC cells were
seeded into six-well plates with 10% FBS-containing
either DMSO or 5-FU (Sigma-Aldrich) at different
dosages and held for an additional 14 days. Colonies were
stained with 0.01% crystal violet and quantified using
ImageJ software.

Western blot analyses

Plasmid construction and site-directed
mutagenesis

Total cellular protein was extracted on ice using
RIPA buffer containing a protease-phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclear and cytoplasmic
protein separation was performed using NE-PER™
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kits
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each protein sample (40 μg)
was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF
membranes (Pall BioTrace, New York, USA) that were
probed with antibodies as previously described [50].

Cell migration and invasion assays

(2 x 105) were seeded in 24-well plates and transiently
co-transfected with the pFLAG-vector control, or with
pFLAG-APA (500 ng) and pNF-κB-luc (500 ng) plus
pRL-SV40 (50 ng). For TWIST1 luciferase activity
measurements, SW480 cells stably expressing the vector
control or APA were co-transfected with pXP2-TWIST1luc (1000 ng) and pRL-SV40 (100 ng). Cells were
harvested at 24 and 48 hours. A Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) was used to detect luciferase
activity according to manufacturer protocols.

pFlag-vector and pFlag-APA-transfected cell
migration and invasion assays were performed using
transwell insert chambers in 24-well plates according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Costar, 8 μm pores;
Corning, NY, USA). For invasion assays, the upper
chambers of each insert were coated with 50 μl BD
Matrigel Matrix (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). Inverted
microscopy was used to count migratory and invasive cells
in five representative fields for each insert.

ALDH activity assays

Wound healing assays

Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was measured
using ALDE-FLUOR kits (STEMCELL Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For details, see Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

SW480-APA, shTWIST#1, and shTWIST#2
cells were seeded in 12-well plates to confluence. Cell
monolayers were scratched with a 20 μl tip, followed
by medium removal, washing, and the addition of fresh
medium. Cells were cultured at 37°C for 48 h and
photographed by inverted microscopy at 0, 24 and 48 h.
Wound areas were measured using ImageJ.

spectrophotometrically as previously described [15].
Briefly, cells were trypsinized and adjusted to 1 x 106
cells/ml in 1 ml 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)/2.5 mm CaCl2
with 1.5 mM α-L-glutamic acid-p-nitroanilide (SigmaAldrich). Following incubation at 37°C for 15, 30, 45 or
60 min, 200 μl substrate were added to a microcentrifuge
tube with ice-cold PBS, centrifuged, and added with 200
μl supernatant to 96-well microtiter plates. APA enzymatic
activity was measured at 405 nm.

Immunofluorescence
SW480 and HT29 cells (3 x 105 each) were seeded
onto 12 mm glass coverslips and incubated for 24 h.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min,
followed by three washes with PBS and blocking with
3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 1
hour. Cells were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin
for 2 hours at RT. DAPI (1:10,000) was used for nuclear
counterstaining. Slides were observed using confocal
microscopy.

Sphere formation assays

Immunohistochemical analysis of human colon
tumor tissue microarrays

Cells were adjusted to 100, 500 or 1,000 cells/200 μl
suspended in sphere-forming medium consisting of serumfree DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10 ng/ml human
recombinant epidermal growth factor and 10 ng/ml basic
fibroblast growth factor. Cells were cultured for 7-30 days
prior to counting sphere numbers.

CRC patient specimens were provided by Dr. J.K.
Jiang following approval from the Institutional Review
Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. The TNM
staging system used for these analyses was from the
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) [51]. IHC
assays were used to analyze human BP1 and TWIST
protein expression. The clinicopathologic characteristics
of CRC patients that used in Figure 6E, Figure 6C and 6D
were shown in Supplementary Table 5 and Table 6. For
details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Animal experiments
HT29-shLuc and HT29-shAPA cells (1 x 105) were
subcutaneously injected into BALB/cAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/
CrlNarl mice (6-8 weeks old). CT26-V and CT26-mAPA
cells (5 x 104) were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c
mice (also 6-8 weeks old). Tumor volume was measured
once every 4 days and calculated using the formula tumor
volume (mm3) = (Length x Width2)/2.

Luciferase reporter constructs and
luciferase assays
Either the pXP2-TWIST1-luc or pNF-κB-luc
reporter construct was used to determine TWIST1 or
NF-κB promoter activity at the transcriptional level.
Luciferase activity was analyzed with a dual-luciferase
reporter assay system (Promega, Wisconsin, USA). For
NF-κB luciferase activity measurements, SW480 cells

at different stages of colorectal cancer, the Mann-Whitney
U-tests was performed because of samples did not indicate
a normal distribution. The Pearson correlation tests were
used to analyze correlations between two continuous
factors. Overall survival and disease-free survival were
analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank
test was applied to compare the cumulative survival
durations in different patient groups. For comparison of
correlation between expression of APA and TWIST on
paired tissue, the Chi-square test was performed used.
The multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to
analyzed relationships between APA and independent
effect of clinical pathological variables on survival. P <
0.05 was considered significant.
