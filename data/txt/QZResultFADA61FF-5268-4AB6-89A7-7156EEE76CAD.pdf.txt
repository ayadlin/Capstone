BACKGROUND: The time interval between surgery and initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) may impact survival in colorectal
and breast cancers. This is the first report describing the association between time to adjuvant chemotherapy (TTAC) and survival in
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: All cases of NSCLC diagnosed in Ontario, Canada, from 2004 to 2006 who underwent surgical resection (n ¼ 3354) were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry. TTAC was defined as the interval between dates
of surgery and initiation of ACT. Factors associated with TTAC greater than 10 weeks were evaluated by logistic regression. The Cox
proportional hazards model was used to describe the effect of delayed TTAC (analyzed as a continuous variable) on overall survival.
RESULTS: Among the 1032 cases treated with ACT, the median TTAC was 8 weeks (range, 1-16 weeks); 35% of cases initiated ACT
more than 10 weeks after surgery. Rates of TTAC greater than 10 weeks varied widely across regions (11%-50%, P ¼ .001). There was
no significant association between increased comorbidity and delayed TTAC; there was a trend toward greater delay in TTAC with
longer postoperative hospital stay (P ¼ .054) and postoperative readmission to hospital (P ¼ .056). Male sex, higher stage of disease,
greater comorbidity, and more extensive surgery were independently associated with inferior survival. TTAC was not associated with
overall survival (odds ratio ¼ 1.00, 95% confidence interval ¼ 0.99-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: One-third of NSCLC patients treated with
ACT in the general population start ACT beyond 10 weeks after surgery. Delayed TTAC does not appear to be associated with inferior

INTRODUCTION
On the basis of results of several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy has
become standard for eligible patients who undergo resection of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, we
reported uptake, practice patterns, and outcomes of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) for NSCLC in the general population
of Ontario, Canada.1,2 Adjuvant chemotherapy was adopted widely from 2004 onward and was not associated with any
increase in hospitalization rates. Moreover, survival at the population level improved after 2004, consistent with the results
of clinical trials. We also found that the drugs and regimens being used in the general population were consistent with
those evaluated in the relevant RCTs.
Several studies in colorectal and breast cancer have found an association between the interval from surgery to initiation
of ACT and survival. Meta-analyses in colorectal and breast cancer3-5 have recently reported that delayed time to adjuvant
chemotherapy (TTAC) is associated with inferior cancer-specific survival and overall survival. The optimal time of initiating ACT for NSCLC is unknown. In the contemporary NSCLC adjuvant trials, patients initiated ACT within approximately 8 to 9 weeks of surgery.6-9 To date, there is no literature to describe TTAC for NSCLC in the general population
and its impact on survival. To address this important gap in the literature, we undertook a population-based study of all
patients treated with ACT for NSCLC in the Canadian province of Ontario from 2004 to 2006. The objectives of this
report are to: 1) describe TTAC in the general population; 2) explore factors associated with delayed TTAC; and 3) evaluate the association between TTAC and survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Population

This report represents a substudy of a larger, population-based, retrospective cohort study that compared
the management and outcome of early-stage NSCLC in
the Canadian province of Ontario before and after
2004.1,2 Ontario has a population of approximately
11.4 million persons and a single-payer universal health
insurance program. The primary study population
included all incident cases of NSCLC diagnosed in Ontario from 2001 to 2006 who underwent surgical resection within 24 weeks of diagnosis. Detailed methods
and primary results have been reported previously.1,2 In
an effort to describe administration of ACT in the contemporary era, this report includes all cases diagnosed
from 2004 to 2006 (n ¼ 3354).
Data Sources

The Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR) is a passive, population-based cancer registry that captures diagnostic and demographic information on at least 98% of all incident
cases of cancer diagnosed in Ontario.10-12 The OCR provided the following information: International Classification of Disease (ICD), version 9 code; the ICD-O (ICDoncology) histology code; age, sex, place of residence; and
date of death. Complete information about vital status
was available up to December 2010. Indicators of the socioeconomic status of the community in which patients
resided at time of diagnosis were linked to the OCR as
described previously.13 Quintiles of the median household income were based on the household income distribution for the full province of Ontario. Quintile 1
represents communities where the poorest 20% of the
Ontario population resided.
A variety of electronic administrative health databases were linked to the OCR. Records of hospitalization
from the Canadian Institute for Health Information provided information about surgical interventions and hospitalizations.14 Physicians in Ontario submit billing codes
for chemotherapy to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan
for remuneration. Physician billing codes for chemotherapy from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database
were linked to the study database, allowing us to identify
which patients received chemotherapy in the complete
province. Clinical databases of Ontario’s 8 comprehensive
Regional Cancer Centers (RCCs) and Princess Margaret
Hospital provided additional records of chemotherapy
delivery. Stage of disease at diagnosis is only captured routinely for patients seen at RCCs. The study was approved
by the Research Ethics Board of Queen’s University.

Definitions of Comorbidity, Management, and
Outcomes

Comorbidity was classified using the Charlson Index
modified for administrative data based on all noncancer
diagnoses recorded on any hospital admission within 5
years prior to surgery.15,16 Surgical resection was defined
as pneumonectomy, lobectomy, or segmentectomy. Adjuvant therapy was defined as any chemotherapy identified
through physician billing records and/or treatment at
RCCs and/or Princess Margaret Hospital administered
within 16 weeks after surgery. TTAC was defined as the
interval between date of admission to hospital for surgery
and date of first chemotherapy treatment. Cases that initiated ACT more than 10 weeks after surgery were classified
as having delayed TTAC.
Statistical Analysis

Factors associated with TTAC > 10 weeks were evaluated
by logistic regression. Predictors were considered statistically significant at P < .05. Overall survival was determined from date of diagnosis, using the Kaplan-Meier
method; comparisons between groups were made using
the log-rank test. Deaths that were potentially related to
ACT were defined as any death that occurred within 16
weeks of starting ACT that was not associated with any
hospitalization ICD diagnostic code of metastatic disease.
The Cox proportional hazards model was used to describe
association between TTAC and survival. TTAC was modeled as a continuous variable (measured in days). All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patterns of Care

There were 15,164 patients diagnosed with NSCLC in
Ontario during 2004-2006, of whom 3354 (22%) underwent surgical resection. Among the surgical cases, 1032
(31%) were treated with ACT. The mean age of the ACT
study cohort was 62 years (range, 28-85 years) and median interval between diagnosis and surgery was 5 weeks
(range, 0-23 weeks). Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Median TTAC was 8 weeks
(range, 1-16 weeks; Fig. 1). Two-thirds of cases (65%)
initiated ACT within 10 weeks of surgery.

The Impact of TTAC on Survival

Survival curves for TTAC groups defined by time
intervals are shown in Figure 2. There was no significant difference in 4-year overall survival between
patients who started ACT within 1 to 10 weeks after
surgery and those who started ACT within 11 to 16
weeks (64% versus 61%, P ¼ .758). Results of the
Cox model are shown in Table 3. In both univariate
and multivariate analyses, TTAC was not associated
with survival. Sex, comorbidity, stage of disease, and
extent of surgery were independently associated with
survival. Women had improved survival compared with
men (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.80, 95% CI ¼ 0.650.99). Patients with substantial comorbidity (Charlson
score of 3þ) had inferior survival (HR ¼ 2.08, 95%

and lobectomy. Patients with squamous histology had a
reduced risk of death compared with patients who had
adenocarcinoma (HR ¼ 0.74, 95% CI ¼ 0.58-0.96).
To explore whether shorter TTAC was associated
with an increased risk of ACT-related toxic death, we determined the proportion of cases in each TTAC group that
died within 16 weeks of starting ACT. Sixteen deaths were
potentially attributable to ACT, and these deaths were
evenly distributed among cases treated 1 to 10 (10 of 666,
2%) and 11 to 16 (6 of 333, 2%) weeks after surgery.
DISCUSSION
Clinical trials reported in 2004 led to substantial uptake
of ACT in the Canadian province of Ontario.1 It is well

recognized that patients and medical care in the general
population may be quite different from that in clinical trials and for that reason, well-designed population-based
studies can provide important insights into how to optimize outcomes in the ‘‘real world’’.17,18 Here, we describe
the timing of ACT initiation relative to NSCLC surgery
in a large population with a universal health insurance
program. Several important findings have emerged from
this population-based study. First, although patients in
clinical trials started ACT within 8 to 9 weeks of surgery,
more than one-third of patients in the general population
began treatment beyond 10 weeks after surgery. Second,
the factor most strongly associated with TTAC is region
of residence, which suggests differences in practice and/or
1247

referral patterns. Third, our results did not demonstrate
that patients with increased comorbidity are more likely
to have delayed TTAC. However, there was a trend toward delayed TTAC among patients with longer postoperative stays in hospital and among cases readmitted to
hospital within 6 weeks of surgery. Finally, contrary to
findings in colorectal and breast cancer, the current study
did not find an association between TTAC and survival in
NSCLC.
A substantial body of literature describing the interval between surgery and initiation of ACT in colorectal
and breast cancers has led to 3 recent meta-analyses in
these disease sites. In our recent report of TTAC and colorectal cancer,3 we identified 10 eligible studies involving
15,410 patients. Meta-analysis demonstrated that a 4week increase in TTAC was associated with a significant
decrease in both overall survival (HR ¼ 1.14, 95% CI ¼
1.10-1.17) and disease-free survival (HR ¼ 1.14, 95% CI
¼ 1.10-1.18). Using a similar approach in breast cancer,5
we identified 9 eligible studies involving 14,357 patients.
Meta-analysis demonstrated that a 4-week increase in
TTAC was associated with a significant decrease in both
overall survival (HR ¼ 1.12, 95% CI ¼ 1.09-1.15) and
disease-free survival (HR ¼ 1.15, 95% CI ¼ 1.11-1.20).
In a second meta-analysis evaluating TTAC in colorectal
cancer, Des Guetz and colleagues also observed a statistically significant increase in mortality risk among patients
with delayed initiation of chemotherapy.4
There is a substantial theoretical rationale to initiate
ACT promptly after curative surgery. Animal models and
clinical data suggest that surgery may increase the numbers of circulating tumor cells and potentiate the growth
of metastatic deposits19-23 Furthermore, the classic mathematical model by Goldie and Coldman predicts that the
probability of mutations that lead to drug resistance
increases over time, dependent on mutation rate and tumor size.24
The relationship between wait times and clinical
outcomes for adjuvant radiotherapy has also been investigated.25,26 In the only systematic review on this subject,
Chen et al performed a meta-analysis on the effect of wait
time on local control rates for several cancers.27 The rate
ratio of local recurrence was 1.14 per 4 weeks of delay
(95% CI ¼ 1.09-1.21); this was consistent across specific
cancers including breast, head and neck, and sarcoma.
One limitation with the existing TTAC literature in
colorectal and breast cancers relates to the fact that many
studies lack information on comorbidity. It is reasonable
to assume that patients with greater comorbidity potentially may have increased postoperative complications and
1248

recovery time, thereby leading to delayed TTAC, or may
have reduced treatment delivery compared with cohorts
with lower comorbidity. Because patients with increased
comorbidity also may be at greater risk of death from any
cause, this is an important potential confounder. However, whereas differences in comorbidity may affect overall
survival, our previous results in colorectal cancer3 demonstrate an almost identical effect size in cancer-specific survival that would not be explained by comorbidity.
Nevertheless, in the current NSCLC study, we did not
find a significant association between comorbidity and
delayed TTAC; moreover, when adjusted for comorbidity, there was no association between TTAC and overall
survival.
To date, there are no published data to provide
insight into the optimal time of initiating ACT for
NSCLC. Within the relevant clinical trials, patients were
required to start ACT within approximately 8 to 9 weeks
of surgery.6,7 Delays between surgery and initiation of
ACT may reflect normal postoperative recovery time, surgical complications, delays in referral and/or consultation,
and patient preference. An important question that arises
from the current study is why is delayed TTAC associated
with inferior survival in colorectal and breast cancers but
not in NSCLC? The first and simplest answer is that
TTAC is associated with survival in NSCLC but that any
survival advantage to early initiation of ACT is offset by
increased risk of death from competing causes. To explore
this possibility, we evaluated whether there was an
increase in early deaths (ie, deaths within 16 weeks of
starting ACT, which potentially may be attributable to
treatment) among those patients with shorter TTAC.
However, our results did not show any increase in ACTrelated mortality among cases with TTAC of 1 to 10
weeks and therefore do not support the hypothesis that
early TTAC is associated with an increased risk of treatment-related death. An alternative explanation for our
study results is that TTAC may be associated with survival
but that the effect size is smaller than in colorectal cancer
(HR ¼ 1.14 per 4-week delay) and breast cancer (HR ¼
1.12 per 4-week delay).3,5 The HR per unit of 1 day in
our current study (HR ¼ 1.00, 95% CI ¼ 0.99-1.00)
translates to a HR per unit of 4 weeks of 0.98 (95% ¼ CI
0.85-1.13). Accordingly, the 95% CI we observed for
NSCLC (0.83-1.11) does not allow us to exclude a
smaller effect of TTAC on overall survival within this
range.
In the absence of additional studies to confirm or
refute the present findings, we are left with the current
result that TTAC is not associated with survival in

NSCLC. Although our data do not offer insight into why
these results differ from other solid tumor disease sites, it
is plausible that the host–tumor environment before and
after surgery for lung cancer may be quite different from
colorectal and breast cancers. Patients with lung cancer
may differ in important ways from patients with other
cancers, and surgical resection of a primary lung cancer is
usually a considerably greater undertaking than resection
of a breast or colon tumor.
Although this study is the first published report to
evaluate the association between delay of ACT and outcomes in patients with NSCLC, several methodologic
limitations merit comment. First, we acknowledge an inherent bias in the current analysis as well as all TTAC
analyses to date: the effect of a patient’s postoperative performance status on TTAC. Second, although the data
sources used in this study describe general aspects of disease, treatment, and outcome for all patients in Ontario,
detailed information related to chemotherapy administration, treatment toxicity, performance status, and stage of
disease is not available for all patients. Third, because cause
of death data currently are incomplete in the OCR, our
outcome results are limited to overall survival and do not
include information about cancer-specific survival. Fourth,
our definition of ACT included treatment that started
within 16 weeks of surgery. Accordingly, our data do not
address the issue as to whether delays in TTAC beyond 16
weeks are associated with inferior survival. Finally, our
study relies on nonrandomized and retrospective data.
However, it is unrealistic to expect that a randomized trial
of TTAC will ever be done; rather, analyses such as ours
are likely to provide the only evidence of such an effect.
Indeed, it has been argued that the parameters applied to
evidence that determines harm are not the same as evidence
required to describe therapeutic benefit.28
In addition to its very large sample size and resulting
statistical power, a major strength of the current study is
the fact that by virtue of the Ontario Cancer Registry, our
study population includes all cases of NSCLC within Ontario and is therefore unselected. By including the entire
population of interest, it is possible to minimize the referral and selection biases that plague traditional institutionbased observational studies.18 Furthermore, because our
data set includes an index of comorbidity for each patient,
we have been able to control for this potentially important
confounder in our survival analysis. Within the colorectal
and breast literature, we are aware of only 3 studies of
TTAC that have controlled for comorbidity.29-31
In summary, we found that one-third of patients in
the general population start ACT for NSCLC more than

10 weeks after surgery, but we could show no significant
association between TTAC and survival in this malignancy. However, our results do not exclude the possibility
of a smaller effect of TTAC on survival than that seen in
colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Further research is
needed to clarify the impact of ACT delays from surgery
in patients with NSCLC. In the meantime, we propose
that patients with NSCLC start ACT as soon as they are
medically fit to do so.
