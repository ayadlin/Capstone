Abstract
The targeted therapeutics sorafenib and vorinostat interact in a synergistic fashion to kill carcinoma cells by
activating CD95, and this drug combination is entering phase I evaluation. In this study, we determined how
CD95 is activated by treatment with this drug combination. Low doses of sorafenib and vorinostat, but not the
individual drugs, rapidly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+, and ceramide levels in gastrointestinal
tumor cells. The production of ROS was reduced in Rho zero cells. Quenching ROS blocked drug-induced CD95
surface localization and apoptosis. ROS generation, CD95 activation, and cell killing was also blocked by
quenching of induced Ca2+ levels or by inhibition of PP2A. Inhibition of acidic sphingomyelinase or de novo
ceramide generation blocked the induction of ROS; however, combined inhibition of both acidic sphingomyelinase and de novo ceramide generation was required to block the induction of Ca2+. Quenching of ROS did not
affect drug-induced ceramide/dihydro-ceramide levels, whereas quenching of Ca2+ reduced the ceramide
increase. Sorafenib and vorinostat treatment radiosensitized liver and pancreatic cancer cells, an effect that
was suppressed by quenching ROS or knockdown of LASS6. Further, sorafenib and vorinostat treatment
suppressed the growth of pancreatic tumors in vivo. Our findings show that induction of cytosolic Ca2+ by
sorafenib and vorinostat is a primary event that elevates dihydroceramide levels, each essential steps in
ROS generation that promotes CD95 activation. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6313–24. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
In the United States, hepatoma and pancreatic carcinomas
have 5-year survival rates of <10% and <5%, respectively
(1, 2). These statistics emphasize the need to develop novel
therapies against these lethal malignancies.
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
pathway is frequently dysregulated in neoplastic transformation (3–5). The ERK1/2 module comprises, along with c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), members of the MAPK super family.

These kinases are involved in responses to diverse mitogens
and stresses, and have also been implicated in survival processes. Activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is generally associated with survival, whereas induction of JNK1/2 and p38
MAPK pathways generally signals apoptosis. Although the
mechanisms by which ERK1/2 activation promote survival
are not fully characterized, several antiapoptotic effector proteins have been identified, including increased expression of
antiapoptotic proteins such as c-FLIP (6–11).
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that was originally
developed as an inhibitor of Raf-1, but which was subsequently shown to inhibit multiple other kinases, including
class III tyrosine kinase receptors such as platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) receptors 1 and 2, c-Kit, and FLT3 (12–14). The antitumor effects of sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma and in
hepatoma have been ascribed to antiangiogenic actions of
this agent through inhibition of the growth factor receptors
(15–17). Several groups have shown in vitro that sorafenib
kills human leukemia cells at concentrations below the
maximum achievable dose (C max ) of 15 to 20 μmol/L,
through a mechanism involving the downregulation of the
antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member MCL-1 (18, 19). In these
studies sorafenib-mediated MCL-1 downregulation occurred
through a translational rather than a transcriptional or

posttranslational process that was mediated by endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress signaling (20, 21). This suggests that the
previously observed antitumor effects of sorafenib are mediated by a combination of inhibition of Raf family kinases,
receptor tyrosine kinases that signal angiogenesis, and the
induction of ER stress signaling.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) represent a class
of agents that act by blocking histone deacetylation, thereby
modifying chromatin structure and gene transcription. HDACIs promote histone acetylation and neutralization of positively charged lysine residues on histone tails, allowing
chromatin to assume a more open conformation, which
favors transcription (22). HDACIs also induce acetylation of
other nonhistone targets, actions that may have plieotropic
biological consequences, including inhibition of HSP90 function, induction of oxidative injury, and upregulation of death
receptor expression (23–25). With respect to combinatorial
drug studies with a multikinase inhibitor such as sorafenib,
HDACIs are of interest in that they also downregulate multiple oncogenic kinases by interfering with HSP90 function,
leading to proteasomal degradation of these proteins. Vorinostat (Zolinza) is a hydroxamic acid HDACI that has shown
preliminary preclinical evidence of activity in hepatoma and
other malignancies with a Cmax of ∼9 μmol/L (26–28).
We have recently published that sorafenib and vorinostat
interact to kill in a wide range of tumor cell types through
activation of the CD95 extrinsic apoptotic pathway (29, 30).
The present studies have extended in greater molecular
detail our analyses to understanding how sorafenib and vorinostat interact to promote CD95 activation.

Transfection of cells with small interfering RNA or
with plasmids
Transfections were performed as described in refs. 29–32.
Assessment of reactive oxygen species generation and
cytosolic Ca2+ levels
Cancer cells were plated in 96-well plates. Cells were preincubated with dihydro-DCF (5 mmol/L for 30 min). Fluorescence measurements were obtained 0 to 30 minutes after
drug addition with a Vector 3 plate reader. Data are presented corrected for basal fluorescence of vehicle-treated
cells at each time point and expressed as a fold increase in
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Carcinoma cells, seeded
in 96-well plates, with fura-2 acetoxymethylester as an indicator. The ratio of Fura-2 acetoxymethylester emissions,
when excited at the wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, was
recorded, and analysis software were used to process and
statistically analyze data.
Mass spectrometric analysis of sphingolipids and
metabolites
Cells were washed extensively with PBS and detached
by trypsinization. An aliquot of cells was taken for protein
determination. For the remainder of cells, internal standards
were added; lipids were extracted; and individual ceramide
acyl chain species were quantified by liquid chromatography,
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (29).
Recombinant adenoviral vectors; infection in vitro
Cells were infected with adenoviruses at an approximate
multiplicity of infection of 50 (29–32).

Materials and Methods
Materials
Sorafenib tosylate (Bayer) and vorinostat (Merck) were
provided by the Cancer Treatment and Evaluation Program,
National Cancer Institute/NIH. Commercially available validated short hairpin RNA molecules to knock down RNA/protein levels were from Qiagen: CD95 (SI02654463; SI03118255).
The kit to assay PP2A activity was purchased from Millipore.
Reagents and performance of experimental procedures were
described in refs. 20, 21, 29–37.
Cell line authentication
HEPG2, HEP3B, Mia PaCa2, and PANC1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection on a regular basis (fresh cryo-preserved vials of cells have been
purchased at least once every 6 mo). Cells have not been authenticated in the corresponding author's laboratory.
Culture and in vitro exposure of cells to drugs
Cells were cultured as described refs. 29–32.
In vitro cell treatments
Cells were isolated at the indicated times and subjected to
trypan blue cell viability assay by counting in a light microscope, or alternatively, Annexin V/propidium iodide assays
were carried to confirm our cell viability data (29–32).

Animal studies
Mia Paca2 cells were injected s.c. (1 × 107), and 14 days
later, tumor volume was determined by calipers. Animals
were segregated into four groups of approximate mean
tumor volume ± SEM and then treated by oral gavage with
vehicle or sorafenib+vorinostat. Animals are treated once per
day for 5 consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the first
drug administration, animals are placed in a shielded container and either mock exposed or have the flanks irradiated
(2 Gy). Forty-eight hours after the first irradiation, a second
irradiation (2 Gy) is performed. Tumors were subjected to
two cycles of drug treatment/radiation exposure (total dose
4 × 2 Gy). Tumor mass is determined at least every 3rd day
after the initiation of drug treatment.
Data analysis
Comparison of the effects of various treatments was performed using ANOVA and the Student's t test. Differences with
a P value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All
experiments were performed on at least two separate occasions: each cell death or ceramide measurement experiment
had between 3 and 4 separate independent experimental data
points per experiment, and each ROS or Ca2+ measurement
had at least 8 to 12 independent data points per experiment.
Thus, experiments shown are the means of multiple individual
data points per experiment from multiple experiments (±SEM).

Vorinostat and Sorafenib

Results
Treatment of cells with low concentrations of sorafenib
and vorinostat, but not the individual agents, promoted activation of CD95 and the generation of ROS (Fig. 1A and B).
The rapid activation of CD95 was not reduced by incubation
with a neutralizing antibody to inhibit FAS ligand (data not
shown). The production of ROS was quenched using N-acetyl
cysteine or MnTBAP (Fig. 1C). Mitochondria-deficient rho
zero HuH7 cells were generated (29–32); cells lacking functional mitochondria exhibited a significantly reduced ability
to generate ROS in response to sorafenib and vorinostat
exposure (Fig. 1D).
Quenching of drug-induced ROS suppressed sorafenib
and vorinostat toxicity (Fig. 2A and B). Quenching of ROS
also suppressed CD95 activation (Fig. 2B, inset). Molecular
quenching of ROS using thioredoxin (TRX) suppressed ROS
generation, CD95 activation, and drug toxicity, whereas
molecular enhancement of ROS generation through expression of a mutant-inactive TRX protein enhanced ROS
generation, although not CD95 activation, and promoted
drug toxicity (Fig. 2C). HuH7 hepatoma cells do not express
CD95 and are relatively resistant to sorafenib and vorinostat-induced cell killing (29). Transfection of HuH7 cells
with a wild-type CD95-YFP construct, but not a construct
lacking two known sites of regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation CD95-YFP FF, facilitated sorafenib and vorinostat toxicity (Fig. 2D). Sorafenib and vorinostat treatment promoted
tyrosine phosphorylation and cell surface localization of
wild-type CD95-YFP but not of CD95-YFP YY-FF (data not
shown; Fig. 2D).
Low concentrations of either sorafenib (1–3 μmol/L) or
vorinostat (250–500 nmol/L) did not strongly increase
either ROS or Ca2+ levels, whereas we did observe, at 9 to
12 μmol/L sorafenib and >1 μmol/L vorinostat concentrations, measurable effects of the individual drugs on ROS
and Ca2+ levels (data not shown). Treatment of tumor cells
with low doses of sorafenib and vorinostat enhanced cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3A). Quenching of ROS did not block
drug-induced cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3B). Quenching of
Ca2+, using either BAPTA-AM or expression of Calbindin
D28, blocked drug-induced ROS induction (data not shown;
Fig. 3C). Expression of Calbindin D28 blocked endogenous
CD95 surface localization, CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation,
and CD95 association with caspase-8 (Fig. 3D, top section).
Expression of Calbindin D28 blocked sorafenib and vorinostat toxicity (Fig. 3D, bottom graph). Knockdown of CD95
neither blocked drug-induced cytosolic Ca 2+ levels nor
blocked capacitative Ca2+ entry into cells (Supplementary
Figs. S1–S3).
Prior studies using sorafenib and vorinostat had implicated ceramide as a mediator of CD95 activation. Loss of acidic sphingomyelinase expression (ASMase −/−) caused a
partial although statistically significant (P < 0.05) reduction
in drug-induced cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Fig. 4A). In contrast
to the partial effect observed on reducing Ca2+ levels, deletion of ASMase expression abolished drug-induced ROS
production (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of ASMase or inhibition

www.aacrjournals.org

of the de novo ceramide synthase pathway each caused a
partial reduction in drug-induced cytosolic Ca 2+ levels,
and complete blockade of ceramide generation abolished
Ca2+ induction (Fig. 4C). Combined knockdown of ASMase
expression and inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis in
hepatoma cells abolished sorafenib- and vorinostat-induced
ROS levels (Fig. 4D).
We next wished to place the sequence of ceramide
generation within the context of elevated ROS and Ca2+
levels. Knockdown of CD95 protected tumor cells from
sorafenib+vorinostat toxicity (Fig. 5A). CD95 activation
and sorafenib+vorinostat toxicity were blocked by knockdown of ASMase and by inhibition of de novo ceramide
synthesis (Fig. 5B). Knockdown of ceramide synthase
6 (LASS6) expression abolished drug-induced activation of
CD95 and significantly reduced drug toxicity (Fig. 5C).
Inhibition of ROS generation did not alter sorafenib+voriinostat-induced C16 ceramide or dihydro-ceramide levels
(Fig. 5D). However, inhibition of drug-induced cytosolic
Ca2+ levels or knock down of LASS6 significantly reduced
the amount of C16 dihydro-ceramide generated following
drug treatment (data not shown; Fig. 5D). In parallel
studies using SW620 colon cancer cells that lack LASS6
expression, transfected to express LASS6, we noted that reexpression of ceramide synthase 6 restored drug-induced
ROS generation levels (Supplementary Fig. S4).
As sorafenib+vorinostat exposure generated ceramide,
and the protein serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A can
play a pivotal role in ceramide-dependent signaling, as well
as in the regulation of ROS generation, we determined
whether modulation of PP2A function affected the actions
of this drug combination (29, 37). Sorafenib and vorinostat
activated PP2A in a LASS6-dependent fashion (Fig. 6A).
Expression of a wild-type PP2A inhibitory protein, whose
function can be blocked by ceramide or a mutant inhibitor
protein, whose function cannot be altered by ceramide,
suppressed drug combination–induced ROS generation
and cell death (Fig. 6B and C). Phosphorylation of mitochondria-localized signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3 (STAT3) S727 plays a key role in regulating
the rate of mitochondrial respiration and de facto mitochondrial ROS production, and STAT3 S727 is a PP2A substrate (38). Sorafenib and vorinostat treatment reduced
STAT3 S727 phosphorylation by ∼50% within 2 hours
(Fig. 6D). Expression of a dominant-negative form of
STAT3 S727A enhanced sorafenib and vorinostat lethality,
whereas expression of activated STAT3 S727D suppressed
drug toxicity (Fig. 6D).
Sorafenib and HDACI drug combination therapy is entering clinical phase I evaluation. Radiotherapy is known to
generate ROS and ceramide, and it is a primary therapeutic
modality for pancreatic cancer. Sorafenib and vorinostat
treatment radiosensitized pancreatic and liver cancer cells
in vitro (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). Radiosensitization
was blocked by expression of TRX or knockdown of LASS6
expression (Supplementary Fig. S5). Treatment of animals
carrying MiaPaca2 tumors with sorafenib and vorinostat significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo, which validates this

Low concentrations of sorafenib and vorinostat interacted
in a greater than additive manner to increase ROS levels.
The induction of ROS occurred in cells lacking expression of
CD95, strongly arguing against death receptor–induced activation of NADPH oxidases in this process. In rho zero cells, the

induction of ROS was reduced, arguing that mitochondria
represent the major source of drug-induced ROS generation. Quenching of ROS blocked CD95 activation and drug
combination–induced cell death. Sorafenib and vorinostat
treatment increased cytosolic Ca 2+ levels in an ROSindependent fashion, and quenching of Ca2+ blocked the increase in ROS levels, CD95 activation, and tumor cell killing.

Inhibition of ASMase or of de novo ceramide generation almost abolished drug combination–induced ROS levels and
CD95 activation, but individually blockade of either pathway
only caused a partial suppression in drug-induced cytosolic
Ca2+. Quenching of Ca2+, or knockdown of ceramide synthase
6, reduced drug-induced ceramide levels. Thus, our data argue
for drug combination–induced Ca2+ signaling (primary) and

ceramide generation (secondary) as two interdependent signaling processes that regulate each other, and that both signals act in concert to promote ROS generation, which is
essential for drug-induced CD95 activation and tumor cell
death (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Bile acids can promote ligand-independent, ASMase,
and ceramide-dependent activation of CD95 in hepatocytes
(11, 34–39). The generation of ceramide has been shown by
many groups to promote ligand-independent activation of
growth factor receptors through the clustering of these receptors and other signal facilitating proteins into lipid rich
domains (39). The six known ceramide synthase genes (LASS)
are localized in the ER, and different LASS proteins have been
noted to generate different chain length ceramide forms (40).
Based on our data, with increases in C16 dihydro-ceramide
levels, it was probable that vorinostat and sorafenib were modulating the activities of LASS6 and LASS5, respectively (40). We
identified ceramide synthase 6 (LASS6) as an essential enzyme
in the drug-induced induction of ceramide, in CD95 activity,
and in tumor cell killing. Treatment of cells with vorinostat
increased the acetylation of LASS6, suggesting that one mechanism of drug-induced LASS6 activity may be mediated in part
through this process.7 It is well known that other nonhistone
proteins are functionally regulated by reversible acetylation,
notably NFκB and HSP90 (22–25). Additional studies will be
required to define the precise site of acetylation in LASS6 and
to discover whether it truly is a site of regulatory acetylation.
The generation of ROS was significantly reduced in rho zero
cells, and we have documented a key role for mitochondria in
the production of ROS in response to various agents (e.g.,
ref. 41). In the present studies, ROS production was a tertiary
effect dependent on the actions of ceramide and Ca2+. It has
been widely documented that the release of Ca2+ from the ER
in to the cytosol rapidly alters Ca2+ levels in mitochondria, and
that changes in Ca2+ fluxes within mitochondria can stimulate
ROS production (e.g., ref. 42). Ceramide levels, independently of
Ca2+ fluxes, are causal in regulating mitochondrial ROS production, and we noted that whereas inhibition of both ASMase and
de novo ceramide generation was required to suppress Ca2+ signaling, inhibition of either de novo or ASMase actions blocked
ROS production. There are several probable modes of ceramide
action at the mitochondrion that could alter respiratory chain
complex activities, including modulation of membrane fluidity
as well as activation of PP2A (37, 43–45). The mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, as well as BCL-2 family proteins, are
heavily Ser/Thr phosphorylated, and ceramide has the potential
to regulate their function through PP2A. In this regard, drug
treatment reduced STAT3 S727 phosphorylation, and inhibition
of PP2A activity blocked sorafenib+vorinostat-induced ROS and
suppressed drug toxicity. The additional molecular targets of
PP2A beyond STAT3 in the regulation of mitochondrial ROS
generation will be explored in future studies.
Ligand-independent activation of CD95 is a complex process,
including tyrosine phosphorylation, altered subcellular localization and formation of the DISC, i.e., association with FADD and

procaspase-8 (37, 38). In our system, drug-induced activation of
CD95, as defined by formation of the DISC or by plasma membrane localization of CD95, was blocked by quenching of
Ca2+, suppressing ceramide formation or by quenching ROS
production. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD95 was essential
for drug-induced membrane localization and DISC formation,
but tyrosine phosphorylation of CD95 was only suppressed
by quenching Ca2+. Thus, at least two independent signals
downstream of drug-induced Ca2+ signaling act to promote
ligand-independent activation of CD95 in GI tumor cells. The
regulation of CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation has been proposed
to be catalyzed by ERBB1 and by Src family tyrosine kinases (38).
An additional question that remains unresolved is how
sorafenib and vorinostat treatment promote Ca2+ signaling,
and what the putative primary effectors for these drugs are.
Two likely targets of sorafenib and vorinostat may be LASS6
and the IP3 receptors that regulate ER Ca2+ fluxes. At present,
little is known about how the ceramide synthase proteins are
enzymatically regulated, and it is possible that sorafenib
reduces phosphorylation at a regulatory site or, alternatively,
that vorinostat promotes LASS6 acetylation, which facilitates
enzyme activation. Whether Ca2+-calmodulin signaling directly or through CaM kinase actions modulates ceramide
synthase function is unknown. It is also possible that the drug
combination causes inactivation of ceramidase enzyme activities that act to lower ceramide levels. IP3 levels are regulated
by phospholipase C and phosphodiesterase enzymes; at present, the effect of sorafenib and vorinostat exposure on the
activities of peritoneal lymphocytes (PLC) enzymes is unclear,
and data from many groups arguing that sorafenib inhibits
receptor tyrosine kinases such as the PDGF and VEGF receptors, and c-Kit would a priori predict for reduced activity of
PLC enzymes that would reduce IP3 levels (14, 15).
Sorafenib and HDACI combination therapy is entering phase
I evaluation at both Virginia Commonwealth University and at
Medical University of South Carolina in a variety of solid and
liquid tumor types. We have noted that sorafenib and vorinostat combination therapy shows in vitro efficacy against multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines (29, 30, 46). The present studies
showed that sorafenib and vorinostat treatment suppressed
the growth of pancreatic tumor cells in vivo, potentially validating this drug combination as a new therapeutic for pancreatic
cancer. Further studies, however, will be required to determine
whether sorafenib and HDACI combination therapy can radiosensitize GI tumors in a sequence-dependent fashion in vivo.
