BACKGROUND: The overall survival (OS) benefit of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
patients older than 70 years is debated. This study examines the outcomes of elderly patients receiving CRT versus radiotherapy (RT)
alone. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients older than 70 years with nonmetastatic oropharyngeal, laryngeal, or hypopharyngeal cancer (T3-4 or N(1)). CRT was defined as chemotherapy started within 14 days of the initiation of RT.
Univariate analysis, multivariate analysis (MVA), propensity score matching (PSM), and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) were performed. RESULTS: The study included 4042 patients: 2538 (63%) received CRT. The median follow-up was 19 months. The unadjusted
median OS was longer with the addition of CRT (P < .001). OS was superior with CRT in the MVA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.68; P < .001) and PSM analyses (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.80; P < .001) in comparison with RT alone.
According to RPA, CRT was associated with longer OS for patients 81 years or younger with low comorbidity scores and either T1-2/
N2-3 disease or T3-4/N0-3 disease. The survival benefit with CRT disappeared for 2 subgroups in the 71- to 81-year age range: those
with T1-2, N1, and Charlson-Deyo 0-1 (CD0-1) disease and those with T3-4, N11, and CD11 disease. Patients who were older than 81
years did not have increased survival with CRT. The receipt of CRT was associated with a longer duration of RT (odds ratio, 1.74; 95%
CI, 1.50-2.01; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients older than 70 years should not be denied concurrent chemotherapy solely on the basis of age; additional factors, including the performance status and the tumor stage, should be taken into account. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 45,000 new head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are diagnosed annually in the United
States, with at least one-quarter occurring in patients older than 70 years.1,2 Tailoring cancer therapy for older patients
with HNSCC can be challenging. Older patients (herein defined patients  71 years old) with HNSCC often have
comorbidities that may hinder their ability to receive optimal multimodality therapy. Although the addition of concurrent
chemotherapy to radiotherapy (RT) is the standard organ preservation approach for locally advanced HNSCC because of
improved overall survival (OS) in multiple prospective, randomized trials, it can be associated with increased short- and
long-term morbidity in comparison with RT alone.3-9
Older patients have been underrepresented in the prospective clinical trials that have defined standards of care. In
the seminal Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC), Pignon et al10 included 93
randomized trials with more than 17,000 patients and demonstrated an absolute OS improvement of 6.5% at 5 years with
the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to RT (CRT). In a subgroup analysis, they noted a decreasing survival benefit of

chemotherapy with age, specifically in patients who were
71 years old or older. However, only 692 of the 17,346
patients (4%) were older than 70 years. Thus, the outcomes of these trials may not be applicable to older
patients. In this study, we used the National Cancer Data
Base (NCDB) to evaluate whether the addition of chemotherapy to RT alone confers an OS benefit to HNSCC
patients who are 71 years old or older.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Patient Selection

The NCDB is a joint project of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. It is a hospital-based registry that
represents 70% of all cancer cases in the United States and
draws data from more than 1500 commission-accredited
cancer programs. The NCDB contains detailed information on disease stage, risk factors specific to HNSCC cancer, and receipt of treatment, including the radiation
dose, treatment site, and chemotherapy delivered during
the first course of treatment. The data used in the study
were derived from a de-identified NCDB file. The American College of Surgeons and the Commission on Cancer
have not verified and are not responsible for the analytic
or statistical methodology used or for the conclusions
drawn from these data by the investigator. The NCDB
has established criteria for ensuring that the data submitted meet specific quality benchmarks. The following
NCDB analysis was performed with the approval of our
local institutional review board.
We initially queried patients with oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer (all histologies) diagnosed between 1998 and 2011; nasopharyngeal, nasal
cavity, and oral cavity cases were not included (Fig. 1).
Patients included in the primary query received RT with
or without chemotherapy, had known follow-up, and had
complete TNM staging; patients with metastatic disease
at presentation and those undergoing upfront surgery
were excluded. The cohort was next limited to squamous
cell carcinoma histologic codes (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology [third edition] histology codes
8052 and 8070-8078), nonpalliative cases, and only those
who were 71 years old or older at diagnosis. The age cutoff
of 71 years was chosen to facilitate direct comparisons
with MACH-NC.10 The resulting cohort was then limited to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
stages III and IV (T1-2/N(1) or T3-4/N0-3) and known
comorbidity scores; T1-2/N0 patients were removed
because RT alone is considered the standard of care. In
1534

the final analysis, all patients considered to have received
CRT had a known chemotherapy start date 14 days before
or after the RT start date; chemotherapy outside the 14day window was not considered concurrent and was
excluded from the final analysis.
Patient Demographics and Treatment Variables

Potentially relevant patient and treatment characteristics
were included. Age was categorized as 71 to 76 or 77
years. Race was categorized as white, African American, or
other. The insurance status was defined by the NCDB
and included the following: not insured, private insurance/managed care, Medicaid, Medicare, other government, and unknown. Residence (metropolitan, urban, or
rural) was coded according to published files by the US
Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service.
The median household income in each patient’s zip code
was assessed as quartiles with respect to the US population. Patient comorbidities were categorized as 0, 1, or 2
according to the Charlson-Deyo (CD) comorbidity
score.11 The institution type was classified as a community cancer program, a comprehensive community cancer
program, or an academic/research program (including
National Cancer Institute–designated comprehensive
cancer centers). Clinical T and N categories were based on
the AJCC staging guidelines.12 Each patient stage was
based on the edition corresponding to the patient’s year of
diagnosis (5th, 6th, or 7th edition). Between editions, no
changes were made to the N category. Patients with T4a
or T4b were combined as T4 in the analysis because this
was a change between AJCC editions. The primary endpoint was OS.
Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 22.0
(SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Pearson chi-square tests were
used to assess associations between categorical variables
and treatment modalities.
The OS interval was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death. OS was first examined with
the Kaplan-Meier method. A survival univariate analysis
(UVA) was performed with the log-rank test and unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs); an HR > 1 corresponded to worse OS.
Patient and clinical variables were selected a priori. Variables included the following: age, receipt of concurrent
chemotherapy, sex, race, insurance, residence, distance
from facility, CD comorbidity score, facility type, year of
diagnosis, tumor site, T category, and N category. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed with OS as

the outcome with a significance level of P < .05. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed with a test of
Schoenfeld residuals for covariates in all final models, and
it returned no significant results.13 Subgroup analyses
including the same variables used in the Cox regression
model for the entire cohort were performed for the tumor
site (oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx) and for patients
documented as receiving a complete course of RT (n 5
1898). A complete course of RT was defined as 66 to 81.6
Gy with 1.2 to 2.0 Gy per fraction according to recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network guidelines and results from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9003 trial.14,15
Multivariate logistic regression models were used to
assess the association between the receipt of CRT and
patient/treatment characteristics, including age, race, faCancer

cility type, and duration of RT treatment (days between
the start and end of RT); the median of 51 days was chosen as the cutoff for RT duration.
To further account for confounding variables, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed for patients
treated with CRT or RT alone, and the same variables
used in the multivariate model were taken into account:
age, receipt of concurrent chemotherapy, sex, race, insurance, residence, distance from facility, CD comorbidity
score, facility type, year of diagnosis, tumor site, T category, and N category. The propensity score was calculated
with logistic regression to estimate the probability of
receiving CRT versus RT. One-to-one propensity matching without replacement was performed with the caliper
match algorithm described by Coca-Perraillon,16 with the
caliper width set to 0.05 times the standard deviation of

the logit of the propensity score.17 Survival outcomes
were assessed with a log-rank test, and the HR was determined by univariate Cox regression.
Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to
quantify the effect of CRT versus RT alone in all significantly different tumor subgroups. RPA was implemented
in the MatLab computing environment (MathWorks,
Inc, Natick, Mass) with the methods described by Ciampi
et al,18 which proceeded briefly as follows. In RPA, the
entire cohort of patients was broken into subsets based on
OS. The splitting of a group of patients (or a cluster in
RPA) by age, stage, and comorbidity score into subclusters
was a fully automated process and was not determined by
the statistician and/or clinician. The T category (T1, T2,
T3, or T4), N category (N0, N1, N2, or N3), and comorbidity score (0, 1, or 2) were analyzed as ordinal variables; age was continuous. At each node, the algorithm
recursively iterated through every possible binary partition
of these patients according to age, T category, N category,
and comorbidity score. The partition that resulted in the
most statistically significant difference in OS was used to
divide the cluster into 2 subclusters, and the process was
repeated. In this way, the algorithm continued to recursively partition the total patient population into smaller
and smaller subclusters until there were no longer any statistically significant partitions possible. Once the entire
cohort of patients had been partitioned, the effect of
chemotherapy was tested in each subcluster with multivariate Cox regression analysis (adjusted for the same factors
described previously).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

We initially queried patients with oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer. After the exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 4042 patients were included
in the study: 1504 (37%) received RT alone, and 2538
(63%) received CRT (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The median
follow-up for the entire cohort was 19 months (range, 2128 months). The median follow-up for surviving
patients was 38 months (range, 2-128 months). The median age of the entire cohort was 77 years (range, 71-90
years). The median age of patients undergoing RT alone
was 80 years (range, 71-90 years), whereas the median age
was 75 years (range, 71-90 years) for patients undergoing
CRT. The majority of CRT cases were laryngeal (51%);
they were followed by oropharyngeal cases (33%) and
hypopharyngeal cases (17%; Table 1)
1536

OS

The median OS for the entire cohort was 21.9 months
with 2- and 5-year OS rates of 48.0% and 24.5%, respectively. Unadjusted 2-year OS was better with CRT versus
RT (55.0% vs 35.1%), as was 5-year OS (30.3% vs
15.2%; HR, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.550.63; P < .001; Fig. 2A). Predictors for longer OS for elderly HNSCC patients under UVA included the addition
of chemotherapy, a distance from the hospital within 25
to 100 miles, and treatment in more recent years. Variables associated with decreased OS under UVA included
older age, female sex, Medicare insurance, higher comorbidity scores, hypopharyngeal carcinoma, and higher T
and N categories (Table 2).
In the multivariate analysis (MVA), elderly HNSCC
patients receiving CRT had longer OS than patients
receiving RT alone (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.58-0.68; P <
.001). Variables associated with inferior OS in the MVA
included older age, Medicare insurance, increasing
comorbidity scores, laryngeal or hypopharyngeal carcinoma, and higher T and N categories (Table 2). Under
logistic regression, after adjustments for patient characteristics, increasing age was associated with decreased odds of
receiving CRT (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.870.89; P < .001). The odds of receiving CRT were also less
likely with a comorbidity score  2 (OR, 0.69; 95% CI,
0.53-0.89; P 5 .003) and for African Americans (OR,
0.56; 95% CI, 0.45-0.69; P < .001). The receipt of CRT
was also associated with a longer duration of RT treatment (>51 days) from start to finish (OR, 1.74; 95% CI,
1.50-2.01; P < .001).
In the MVA, a subgroup analysis by tumor site
showed that the addition of CRT improved OS for all primary tumor sites: oropharynx (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.480.64; P < .001), larynx (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.59-0.74; P
< .001), and hypopharynx (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.550.80; P < .001). For patients who received a complete
course of RT, CRT was associated with longer OS (HR,
0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.87; P < .001).

PSM

PSM for all patients combined resulted in a cohort consisting of 2334 patients who were well matched and were
divided evenly between RT alone and CRT (n 5 1167;
Table 3). In agreement with the MVA, elderly patients
receiving CRT had longer 2- (51.0% vs 38.2%) and 5year survival (26.4% vs 18.1%; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.660.80; P < .001; Fig. 2B).

received CRT and 586 received definitive RT alone. The
following variables were included: age (continuous), T
category, N category, and CD comorbidity score. The
algorithm identified 9 terminal nodes based on these variables, and the effect of CRT was tested in each. To simplify the classification, terminal clusters were reabsorbed
into the parent cluster if no downstream differences in
treatment effect were observed; in this way, clusters were
reorganized to facilitate clinical decision making. Note
that the breakpoints between different cohorts (eg, the 81year age breakpoint) were not chosen by the authors;
rather, these breakpoints were identified in the RPA algorithm as resulting in the most statistically significant difference in OS.
Under RPA, CRT was associated with longer OS for
patients 81 years or younger with low comorbidity scores
and either T1-2/N2-3 disease or T3-4/N0-3 disease. This
survival benefit with the addition of chemotherapy disappeared for 2 subgroups in the 71- to 81-year age range:
those with T1-2, N1, and CD0-1 disease and those with
T3-4, N11, and CD11 disease. Patients who were older
than 81 years did not have increased survival with CRT
(Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based comparative analysis of elderly HNSCC patients undergoing
definitive CRT versus RT alone. Our study combines
data gathered from many institutions reflecting a representative cohort of elderly HNSCC patients. When we
examined the entire elderly population with head and
neck cancer in the NCDB, CRT was associated with
1538

improved median OS in UVA, MVA, and PSM analyses
in contrast to MACH-NC.10 Using RPA, we were then
able to identify several subgroups of elderly patients who
did not experience longer OS with CRT versus RT alone.
There was no association between longer OS and CRT for
patients who were older than 81 years. In the 71- to 81year age cohort, patients did not have longer OS with
CRT when they had (1) T3-4, N1-3, and CD11 or (2)
T1-2, N1, and CD0-1 disease. We hypothesize that the
lack of longer OS with CRT in these groups may have
resulted from excess toxicity with respect to age (age > 81
years), comorbidity (very advanced disease; CD11), or
the risk of disease (stage III). Importantly, most patients
(>70%) in this study were categorized as CD0. The RPA
model that was developed in this analysis may provide
helpful practice guidelines for clinicians to use when they
are discussing the risks and benefits of additional chemotherapy for locally advanced HNSCC treated with definitive RT. According to the final results of this NCDB
analysis, CRT is associated with longer median OS for
patients 81 years or younger with low comorbidity scores
and either T1-2/N2-3 disease or T3-4/N0-3 disease.
In contrast to our study, which showed an absolute
5-year survival difference of 8% in the PSM analysis for
the entire elderly population, MACH-NC demonstrated
no OS benefit with CRT versus RT alone in patients older
than 70 years.10 Although the increasing risk of death
from other causes may have led to this finding (termed the
dilution effect), that analysis had several limitations.
Although our study included 4042 patients, the MACHNC study included only 693 of 17,346 patients (4%) in
this age category; this limited its statistical power. Second,

patients represent nearly two-thirds of cancer patients,
they account for less than 10% of head and neck clinical
trial participants.19 The possible reasons for low trial par1540

physician concerns over the high rate of hospitalizations

Figure 3. Recursive partitioning analysis tree for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients who were 71 years old or older.
HRs, CIs, and P values evaluating the overall survival benefit of CRT versus RT alone are shown for each subgroup (age, T category, N category, and CD comorbidity score). CRT was associated with longer overall survival in patients 81 years or younger
with low comorbidity scores and either T1-2/N2-3 disease or T3-4/N0-3 disease. This survival benefit with the addition of chemotherapy disappeared for 2 subgroups in the 71- to 81-year age range: those with T1-2, N1, and CD0-1 disease and those with T3-4,
N11, and CD11 disease. Patients who were older than 81 years did not have increased survival with CRT. *An HR < 1 corresponds
to improved overall survival. CD indicates Charlson-Deyo; CI, confidence interval; CRT, chemoradiotherapy; HR, hazard ratio.

outcomes than clinical trials in this underrepresented
population.
One population-based analysis conducted by
VanderWalde et al23 used Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER)–Medicare analysis and came
to the reverse conclusion with respect to our study:
CRT is associated with an increased risk of mortality in
comparison with RT. There are several differences
between their study and ours. First, their study used
SEER-Medicare data, whereas we used the NCDB.
Second, their CRT group included patients who
received both induction chemotherapy and concurrent
chemotherapy, whereas our patient population
included the latter but not the former; current randomized trials have demonstrated no improvement in OS
with induction chemotherapy, and patients undergoing induction chemotherapy are often less likely to
complete definitive CRT, which can affect survival.24,25 Furthermore, the actual use of propensity
scores was different between the 2 studies. Although we
Cancer

May 15, 2016

performed matching with the propensity scores and a
subsequent analysis of the subset of observations by
which matching was performed, VanderWalde et al
used propensity score weighting to estimate HRs comparing CRT with RT. As argued by Rosenbaum,26
matching-based estimates (such as ours) are less susceptible to extrapolations in the data in comparison with
weighting approaches. Lastly, the distributions of covariates were different between the 2 studies. VanderWalde et al included surgical cases and additional sites
not included in our analysis (oral cavity, salivary gland,
nasopharynx, and middle ear). The stage was recorded
as the SEER summary stage and not as the AJCC stage
as in our study, and the majority of their patients had
unknown nodal staging. Their study also included
patients with higher comorbidity scores and cases diagnosed since 1992; this increased the likelihood of
including patients treated with older RT techniques,
which could contribute to toxicity and survival
outcomes.
1541

Original Article

We acknowledge that the findings of this study are
hypothesis-generating because information regarding toxicity, exact chemotherapy regimens, and the quality of
radiation delivery are not available in the NCDB. For
example, RT modality (3-dimensional vs IMRT) is not
well coded in the NCDB, with the majority of cases coded
as photons without specification of which modality.
However, there are modern data about the tolerability of
CRT in the elderly. Michal et al27 compared a cohort of
40 patients who were 70 years old or older and were
receiving CRT with comparably treated younger patients
receiving CRT and found similar 5-year disease specific
survival rates for the 2 groups, even though the older
patients again had higher rates of hospitalization, myelosuppression, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube dependence.27 A similar study comparing patients
who were 75 years old or older with patients younger than
75 years found no difference in treatment breaks, RT
completion, or treatment-related death between the 2
groups.28 Lastly, there are similar rates of toxicity in treatment completion for patients who are 70 years old or
older and patients who are younger than 70 years when
they are treated with IMRT and IGRT.29 Using the
SEER-Medicare database, Beadle et al30 demonstrated
improvements in OS when elderly patients with head and
neck cancer were treated with IMRT instead of nonIMRT techniques. These studies suggest that modern RT
and chemotherapy may improve treatment tolerance and
outcomes for older patients. Additional RT approaches,
including adaptive planning, judicious ipsilateral neck
RT, and organ-sparing techniques, may further reduce
RT toxicity in the elderly.31-34 However, as our study
demonstrates, elderly patients with comorbidities are less
likely to benefit from CRT and are more susceptible to
receiving a prolonged course of RT, likely because of
treatment breaks.
The NCDB confers several benefits over other population databases, including a large sample size and the
availability of RT details. However, the NCDB is limited
by its retrospective nature and the potential for miscoding. Moreover, human papillomavirus and smoking status, 2 key prognostic features for young and old patients
with HNSCC, were largely unknown for this patient population.35,36 Next, there may be an inherent selection bias
for those receiving CRT that is not accounted for by the
variables available in the NCDB. However, we note that
our results hold under PSM analysis, which attempts to
account for this bias. Other limitations include the lack of
documentation of the type of chemotherapy used.
Although the receipt and timing of chemotherapy were
1542

known, the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and number of cycles administered were unknown. In addition,
although the CD comorbidity score is a predictor for outcomes in population-based studies, it does not define the
severity of each comorbidity. Lastly, outcome measurements are limited to OS because the NCDB does not record data on locoregional control, distant disease, disease
recurrence, or cause of death, including cancer-specific
survival.
There continues to be an inverse relation between
age and CRT administration.37 Because only a minority
of elderly patients are included in prospective, randomized trials, it is difficult to evaluate treatment outcomes
for this growing patient population. In this nationally representative population database, with 23% of the patients
older than 70 years, we demonstrate that the subgroup of
elderly HNSCC patients who are 81 years old or younger
and have T1-2/N2-3 or T3-4/any N disease and low
comorbidity scores have longer median OS with CRT versus RT alone. With modern RT techniques, systemic
therapy, and supportive care, our findings should guide
future prospective trials to help confirm the benefit of
multimodality treatment in the elderly.
