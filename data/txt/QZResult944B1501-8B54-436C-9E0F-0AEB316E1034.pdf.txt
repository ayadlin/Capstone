Abstract
Interactions of hyaluronan with CD44 in tumor cells play
important cooperative roles in various aspects of malignancy
and drug resistance. Emmprin (CD147; basigin) is a cell
surface glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily
that is highly up-regulated in malignant cancer cells and
stimulates hyaluronan production, as well as several downstream signaling pathways. Emmprin also interacts with
various monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). Malignant
cancer cells use the glycolytic pathway and require MCTs to
efflux lactate that results from glycolysis. Glycolysis and
lactate secretion contribute to malignant cell behaviors
and drug resistance in tumor cells. In the present study, we
find that perturbation of endogenous hyaluronan, using small
hyaluronan oligosaccharides, rapidly inhibits lactate efflux
from breast carcinoma cells; down-regulation of emmprin,
using emmprin small interfering RNA, also results in
decreased efflux. In addition, we find that CD44 coimmunoprecipitates with MCT1, MCT4, and emmprin and colocalizes
with these proteins at the plasma membrane. Moreover, after
treatment of the cells with hyaluronan oligosaccharides,
CD44, MCT1, and MCT4 become localized intracellularly
whereas emmprin remains at the cell membrane. Together,
these data indicate that constitutive interactions among
hyaluronan, CD44, and emmprin contribute to regulation of
MCT localization and function in the plasma membrane of
breast carcinoma cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(4):1293–301]

Introduction
Emmprin (CD147), a multifunctional glycoprotein and member
of the immunoglobulin superfamily, was originally characterized as
an inducer of matrix metalloproteinase synthesis and shown to be
identical to basigin (1). Emmprin is highly expressed on the surface
of numerous types of malignant cancer cells (2), and experimental
up-regulation markedly enhances tumor growth and invasion
in vivo (3). However, it is now clear that emmprin interacts with a
wide range of binding partners (2), including monocarboxylate
transporters (MCT; ref. 4). At least 14 members of this family have
been cloned and distinguished by their kinetic properties and
tissue distribution. MCT1, MCT3, and MCT4 require association

with emmprin in the endoplasmic reticulum for trafficking to the
plasma membrane. The MCTs transport lactate across the plasma
membrane, and emmprin-MCT interaction is required for MCT
activity, as well as trafficking to the plasma membrane, in muscle
and retinal cells (5–7). Furthermore, MCT activity is fundamental to
the glycolytic phenotype that characterizes most malignant
cancers, wherein glycolysis is increased even in the presence of
oxygen: the so-called ‘‘Warburg effect.’’ Increased glycolysis in
cancers is associated with various conditions, such as hypoxia,
acidosis, and mitochondrial defects, which result in enhanced drug
resistance and malignancy (8–11). An outcome of increased
glycolysis is production of lactate, which must be pumped across
the plasma membrane via the proton-coupled MCTs to avoid
cytotoxic intracellular accumulation of lactate. Lactate efflux at the
leading edge of tumor cells acidifies the surrounding microenvironment, which can enhance cell invasion (12), metastasis (13), and
drug resistance (11). MCT1 is the most widely expressed member of
this family and is elevated in a variety of cancers, including
neuroblastoma (14), high-grade gliomas (15), and colorectal
carcinomas (9). MCT4 is expressed preferentially in tissues that
require high levels of glycolysis. Recently, MCT4 was shown to be
colocalized with emmprin in the plasma membrane of metastatic
MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, wherein trafficking of these two
proteins to the plasma membrane is mutually interdependent.
Moreover, suppressed expression of MCT4 resulted in decreased
migratory capacity in these cells, most likely due to inhibition of
emmprin function (16).
Studies in our laboratory have revealed that emmprin stimulates
production of the extracellular and cell surface–associated
polysaccharide, hyaluronan, in breast carcinoma cells (17). In
addition to its structural role in extracellular matrix assembly and
in hydrodynamic properties of tissues, hyaluronan has an
instructive, cell signaling function that is activated in malignant
cancer cells (18, 19). Hyaluronan signals through multivalent
interaction with several cell surface receptors, with CD44 being the
best characterized of these receptors in cancer cells. Variant
forms of CD44 with several exon combinations are commonly
up-regulated in carcinomas and have been implicated in numerous
aspects of cancer progression (20, 21). Many of the prooncogenic,
downstream effects of hyaluronan-CD44 interaction are also
induced by increased emmprin expression; correspondingly,
treatment with antagonists of constitutive hyaluronan-CD44
interactions reverses these effects of emmprin (17, 22, 23). One
means of antagonizing hyaluronan-CD44 interactions is treatment
with small hyaluronan oligosaccharides (oligomers) that act by
competitively replacing endogenous, multivalent hyaluronan
polymer with a monovalent ligand (24) or by inhibiting hyaluronan
production (25).

Figure 1. Inhibition of lactate efflux by emmprin siRNA and hyaluronan oligomers. A, emmprin is necessary for lactate efflux. MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells
were grown to 70% confluence, transfected for 24 h with control or emmprin siRNA, and subject to ECAR analysis as described in Materials and Methods. Equal cell
density was adjusted according to Ag protein per well. The inset shows the decreased level of emmprin associated with cells treated with emmprin siRNA (right )
compared with control siRNA (left ); emmprin was visualized by immunolabeling. B-D , hyaluronan oligomers decrease lactate efflux. MCF-7 (B), MDA-MB231 (C ), and
MDA-MB436 (D ) human breast carcinoma cells were grown to 70% confluence. After baseline acquisition, cells were treated with 100 Ag/mL hyaluronan oligomers
(o-HA ) and subject to ECAR analysis, as described in Materials and Methods. Error bars , SDs. Significant differences were observed (*, P < 0.05, compared with
control). A-D , representative of three or more independent experiments.

Two sets of observations indicate a possible relationship
of hyaluronan to MCT activity. The first of these, discussed
above, is that emmprin stimulates hyaluronan production and its
downstream effects. Second, lactate stimulates hyaluronan
synthesis and expression of CD44 variants in fibroblasts (26)
and melanoma cells (27), and lactate response elements are
present in several hyaluronan-related genes, e.g., CD44 and the
hyaluronidase HYAL1 (28). Thus, we have examined the
relationship of hyaluronan, CD44, and emmprin to MCT
expression and activity in breast carcinoma cells. We have found
that antagonizing hyaluronan interactions by treatment with
hyaluronan oligomers and knockdown of emmprin with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) both result in a decrease in lactate
secretion. Furthermore, we found that both emmprin and CD44
form complexes with MCT1 and MCT4 at the plasma membrane
and that treatment with hyaluronan oligomers leads to intracellular localization of CD44 and the MCTs. Together, the data
indicate that interactions among hyaluronan, CD44, and emmprin
contribute to MCT localization and function at the plasma
membrane.

Hyaluronan, CD44, Emmprin Regulate Lactate Transporters
Cell culture. MCF7, MDA-MB231, and MDA-MB436 cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 (R-8755) with 2.38 g/L HEPES, 2 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and
10% FBS (pH 7.4) and maintained at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2-95% air
incubator. For preparation of lysates from oligomer-treated cells, cells
were seeded in 10-cm dishes 48 h before oligomer treatment. For
preparation of confocal microscopy slides from cells treated with oligomer,
cells were seeded in eight-well multichamber culture slides (BD Biosciences)
48 h before oligomer treatment.
siRNA silencing. At 24 h after plating, cells were transfected with control
or emmprin siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations in serum-free medium for 24 h before
cell fixation or lactate efflux analysis.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. After a 1-h incubation with hyaluronan oligomers, whole-cell lysates were prepared for
immunoprecipitation or direct immunoblotting using a modified immunoprecipitation assay buffer provided with the Catch and Release immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate Biotechnology) modified to contain
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin and leupeptin,
2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mmol/L sodium fluoride. Protein

content was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and samples
containing 50 Ag or 500 Ag of protein were solubilized in SDS sample buffer
or used in immunoprecipitation, respectively. Immunoprecipitation was
carried out with the Catch and Release immunoprecipitation kit, according
to the manufacturer’s specifications, with resultant bound protein
solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Samples so collected were resolved on
Pierce 4% to 20% reducing polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose
(Osmonics) with a Pierce apparatus, and subject to immunoblot analysis.
Immunoblots were blocked, probed, and visualized, as previously described
(23), with antibodies as indicated.
Lactate efflux analysis. The XF Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse
Bioscience) is a 24-well instrument that continuously measures the uptake
and excretion of metabolic end products. The XF analyzer contains a sensor
cartridge, embedded with 24 pairs of fluorescent biosensors (O2 and pH),
which monitor substrate concentration changes by a fiber optic waveguide.
Lactate secretion was measured by analysis of extracellular acidification
rate (ECAR), which is caused by proton release and primarily reflects lactate
excretion (29) when repeated measurements are taken over a period of time,
i.e., f1 h (Seahorse Biosciences).

Figure 2. CD44 forms complexes with MCTs and
emmprin. A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells express
CD44 and MCTs. Cells were grown to 70% confluence
(48 h). After treatment with and without 100 Ag/mL
hyaluronan oligomers for 1 h, whole-cell extracts were
prepared, as described in Materials and Methods, and
50 Ag lysates were resolved on a 4% to 20% SDS-gel
and processed for Western blot analysis, as described
in Materials and Methods. Left, MCF-7 and MB231
cells express standard CD44 (s, molecular weight of
f85 kDa) and CD44 splice variants (v, molecular
weight of f130 kDa). Right, MCF-7 cells express
predominantly MCT1; MB231 cells express
predominantly MCT4. Multiple experiments showed
that treatment of the cells with hyaluronan oligomers
(o-HA ) had no significant effect on MCT1 or MCT4
expression. B, CD44 forms complexes with MCT1,
MCT4, and h-actin. Whole-cell extracts were prepared
identically to the blots in A from MB231 cells that
had been pretreated with and without 100 Ag/mL
hyaluronan oligomers for 1 h. The extracts were
immunoprecipitated (IP ) with antibodies to MCT1 (left ),
MCT4 (middle ), or CD44 (‘‘pan-CD44’’; right ), then
processed for Western blotting as indicated. Multiple
experiments showed that mainly variant CD44
coimmunoprecipitated with the MCTs and that
treatment with hyaluronan oligomers reproducibly
reduced the amount of this CD44 in the MCT
immunoprecipitates (left and middle ). Note that
standard CD44 was immunoprecipitated preferentially
with the ‘‘pan-CD44’’ antibody (right ), although more
variant CD44 than standard is present in these extracts
(A, left ); also note that cross-reaction occurred
between MCT secondary antibodies and this
‘‘pan-CD44’’ antibody (lane Ab ). The hyaluronan
oligomers decreased interaction of actin with the MCTs
(left and middle ) but not with CD44 (right ). C, CD44
interacts with emmprin. MB231 cells were treated,
and whole-cell extracts immunoprecipitated with
antibody against CD44 as in B, then processed for
immunoblotting as indicated. Although less variant
CD44 than standard CD44 was immunoprecipitated,
the f130-kDa variant form included the v3 exon
product. Emmprin, mainly the high molecular form, was
coimmunoprecipitated with CD44 (ns, nonspecific
band). The immunoblot in the inset shows high and low
molecular forms of emmprin in a whole cell extract
(WCE ) from nontreated cells. D, emmprin forms
complexes with MCTs and CD44. Whole-cell
extracts from MB231 cells, prepared as in A, were
immunoprecipitated with an antibody to emmprin.
Mainly variant CD44 was coimmunoprecipitated with
emmprin. Hyaluronan oligomer treatment of the cells
decreased emmprin-MCT interaction but did not
affect emmprin-CD44 interaction significantly. A–D,
representative of three or more independent
experiments.

Cells were seeded in XF24 cell culture microplates (Seahorse Biosciences)
at 5.0 to 6.0  104 per well in 100 AL serum medium and incubated at 37jC
in 5% CO2 for 24 h. The assay is initiated by aspirating the serum medium,
replacing it with 700 to 900 AL of prewarmed (37jC) assay medium (DMEM
without bicarbonate) containing 5 mmol/L glucose and 100 nmol/L insulin,
and then incubating the plate at 37jC. The assay medium is mixed by the
XF24 analyzer every 3 to 5 min to restore normal oxygen tension and pH in
the wells. After baseline ECAR measurements are taken, 70 to 100 AL of a
test compound prepared in assay media are injected into each well to final
working concentration. After injection, the solution in the wells is mixed,
after which the pH and O2 tension are measured every 22 s for f2 min,
during which time the O2 tension drops f30 mm Hg and the pH of the
medium declines up to 0.4 pH units. ECAR is calculated from the slope of
pH versus time, and it is reported in milli-pH per minute.
Confocal microscopy. Cells plated at low density on tissue culturetreated glass multichamber culture slides (BD Falcon) and treated as
indicated were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 23jC,
permeabilized by treatment with PBS containing 0.02% Triton X-100 for
10 min at 23jC, and blocked for nonspecific binding by incubation for
12 h at 4jC with PBS–3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were
incubated with antibodies as indicated in PBS–3% BSA overnight at 4jC.
After three 5-min washes with PBS, cells were incubated with AlexaFluor
(Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies and Draq5 nuclear stain (Biostatus
Limited) or AlexaFluor phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 2 h. After three
additional 5-min washes with PBS, mounting medium (Biomeda Corp.) was
added and coverslips were applied. Slides were viewed on a Leica Total
Confocal System, Spectral Prism 2, Acoustic Optical Beam Splitter (TCS SP2
AOBS) in the Molecular Morphology and Imaging Center in the Department
of Cell Biology and Anatomy.

Results
Inhibition of lactate efflux by emmprin siRNA and by
hyaluronan oligomers. As discussed in Introduction, emmprin is
a chaperone or cofactor for MCT1, MCT3, and MCT4 and is
essential for their trafficking to the plasma membrane and for
their function in various nontumor cell types. Emmprin-MCT
interactions also have been shown in human breast carcinoma cells
(16). Moreover, interaction of emmprin with MCT4 promotes
expression of both protein partners at the plasma membrane of
these cells (16). We show here that emmprin is also essential for
MCT function in breast carcinoma cells in that siRNA knockdown
of emmprin inhibits lactate efflux, as measured by analysis of ECAR
(Fig. 1A).
Because emmprin and hyaluronan activities interact at many
levels, we investigated whether an antagonist of constitutive
hyaluronan interactions also affects lactate efflux. Small hyaluronan
oligomers are competitive inhibitors of polymeric hyaluronan-CD44
interaction (24) and attenuate constitutive hyaluronan-CD44–
induced signaling (23, 30). In addition, they have been found to
inhibit hyaluronan production (25). We found that treatment with
hyaluronan oligomers inhibits lactate efflux in three different
human breast carcinoma cell lines. This inhibition occurred as
quickly as within 10 to 20 minutes of treatment and continued for
the 1-hour to 2-hour duration of the experiment (Fig. 1B–D).
Interaction of CD44 with emmprin, MCT1, and MCT4. The
functional results shown in Fig. 1 suggest that constitutive
hyaluronan-CD44 interactions influence MCT activity. Therefore,
it is possible that CD44, as well as emmprin, may interact directly
or indirectly with one or more of the MCTs. To begin investigating
this possibility, we analyzed lysates of MCF-7 and MDA-MB231
cells for the presence of CD44 and MCTs. Both cell types
express standard (f85 kDa) and variant (f130 kDa) forms of
CD44 (Fig. 2A, left). We chose to examine MCT1 and MCT4 because

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

they are the most common MCTs found in cancer cells and they are
known to interact with emmprin. MB231 cells express both MCT1
and MCT4, although the latter is predominant as found previously
for these cells (16); MCF-7 cells express mainly MCT1 (Fig. 2A,
right). We also examined the effect of treatment of the cells with
hyaluronan oligomers on expression of CD44 and the MCTs, but no
significant effects were obtained (Fig. 2A).
To determine whether CD44 interacts with MCT1 or MCT4, we
performed immunoprecipitations from lysates of MDA-MB231 cells
using antibodies against MCT1 and MCT4, then immunoblotted
with antibody against CD44. In both cases, we observed a single
band of CD44 (Fig. 2B, left and middle) that corresponds with the
f130 kDa variant form that was observed in immunoblots of
whole-cell lysates (Fig. 2A); although the amounts of CD44 that
coimmunoprecipitated were relatively small, they were consistent
in several experiments. In addition, we found that MCT1 and CD44,
mainly variant CD44, coimmunoprecipitate from MCF-7 cell lysates
on treatment with antibody against MCT1 (data not shown). We
also performed immunoprecipitations with antibody against CD44
and then immunoblotted for MCT1 and MCT4. Both MCTs were
found in the CD44 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B, right). It should be
noted, however, that the ‘‘pan-CD44’’ antibody used here preferentially immunoprecipitates standard CD44 (Fig. 2B, right), although
it clearly recognizes variants of CD44 in immunoblots (Fig. 2A, left).
In separate experiments, we immunoblotted with antibody raised
against the CD44v3 exon product, as well as with the ‘‘pan-CD44’’
antibody. We found v3 to be present within the same region of the
gel as the f130-kDa form of CD44 (Fig. 2C), thus confirming that
this band does contain variant CD44; a preference for standard
CD44 was again observed with the ‘‘pan-CD44’’ antibody. These
experiments indicate that CD44 forms complexes directly or
indirectly with MCT1 and MCT4 in breast carcinoma cells.
However, because only a small proportion of total CD44 seems to
immunoprecipitate with the MCTs (Fig. 2B, left and middle), it is
likely that the MCTs interact with a subfraction of CD44, most
likely a variant form.
As expected from previous studies (31, 32), both cell types
express high and low molecular weight forms of emmprin that
correspond to high and low glycosylated forms, respectively
(MB231, Fig. 2C, inset; MCF-7, not shown). Previous evidence
indicates that emmprin interacts directly with MCT1 and MCT4,
and our data above suggest that CD44 also interacts in some way
with these MCTs. Accordingly, we found here that emmprin and
CD44 coimmunoprecipitate from lysates of MB231 cells, whether
using antibody against CD44 (Fig. 2C) or emmprin (Fig. 2D). In the
former case, the emmprin in the immunoprecipitate is mainly the
high molecular weight, glycosylated form; in the latter case, CD44
in the immunoprecipitate is mainly variant CD44.
Previous work in our laboratory has shown that signaling
complexes containing receptor tyrosine kinases and CD44 are
dissociated by treatment of cells with antagonists of hyaluronanCD44 interaction, such as hyaluronan oligomers (23, 33). Thus,
we treated MB231 cells with hyaluronan oligomers to determine
whether interactions between CD44 and MCT1 or MCT4 are also
influenced constitutively by hyaluronan. We found that immunoprecipitates of MCT1 or MCT4 from lysates of cells that had been
pretreated with hyaluronan oligomers for 1 hour contained less
CD44 than immunoprecipitates from lysates of untreated cells
(Fig. 2B, left and middle). It also seemed that somewhat lower
amounts of MCT1 and MCT4 were present in immunoprecipitates obtained with antibody against CD44 from lysates of

were treated with and without 100 Ag/mL hyaluronan oligomers for 1 h. After fixation, permeabilization, and blocking of nonspecific binding, the cells were
immunolabeled for CD44 (green ), MCT1 or MCT4 (red), and emmprin (blue ) and visualized by confocal microscopy at a Z plane corresponding to the approximate
center of the cell. Arrows, areas shown at higher magnification in the insets. a, b, and b’, triple labeling for all three components; colocalization appears as a white

staining for CD44 is seen in the oligomer-treated cells in b. b’ in A is the same as in b, but is shown at higher gain than in a and b, to illustrate internalization of MCT1,
as well as CD44; increased gain is necessary for clear visualization because the MCT becomes highly dispersed in the cytoplasm after oligomer treatment. Similar
oligomer-induced internalization was observed for MCT4 (not shown). Emmprin seems to remain at the cell surface after hyaluronan oligomer treatment. c and d,

oligomer-treated cells than untreated cells (Fig. 2B, right), but
interference from cross-reaction with the CD44 antibody prevented
clear-cut interpretation of these gels. However, immunoprecipitation with emmprin antibody clearly yielded lower amounts of
MCTs from lysates of oligomer-treated cells than controls, although
coimmunoprecipitation of CD44 with emmprin was not significantly affected (Fig. 2D). These results support the possibility that
the hyaluronan oligomers interfere with CD44-MCT interactions in
some manner.
It is well known that CD44 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton
(19). Therefore, we also examined the interaction of h-actin with
the MCTs and the effects of treatment with hyaluronan oligomers.
We found that h-actin is present in immunoprecipitates of MCT1
and MCT4 but pretreatment of the cells with hyaluronan oligomers
reduced this interaction (Fig. 2B, left and middle). However,
oligomer treatment of the cells did not inhibit interaction of CD44
with h-actin (Fig. 2B, right). These experiments indicate that the
interaction of MCT1 and MCT4 with h-actin is most likely
mediated by CD44-actin interaction, but the latter interaction is
not affected by hyaluronan-CD44 interaction.
To further explore the associations between CD44, emmprin,
and the MCTs, we examined the localization of each protein
by confocal microscopy. Colocalization of CD44 (green), MCT1
(red), and emmprin (blue) was observed at the membrane of

www.aacrjournals.org

MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 3A, a and c) and MCF-7 cells (data not
shown). Similar colocalization of CD44 and emmprin with MCT4
was also observed in MB231 cells (Fig. 3B, a and c). These results
confirm that interactions between CD44, emmprin, and the MCTs
occur at the surface of breast carcinoma cells.
Internalization of CD44 and MCTs by treatment of cells with
hyaluronan oligomers. Although confocal microscopy showed
that CD44 colocalizes with MCT1 and MCT4 (Fig. 3) and treatment
with hyaluronan oligomers had a rapid and strong effect on MCT
function (Fig. 1), the effects of the oligomers on coimmunoprecipitation of CD44 and the MCTs were not always definitive (e.g., Fig.
2B, right). Nevertheless, these immunoprecipitation experiments
did suggest that treatment with hyaluronan oligomers may
decrease interactions between CD44 and the MCTs within a
subpopulation associated with emmprin (Fig. 2D). Therefore we
examined the cellular distribution of CD44, emmprin, and the
MCTs after treatment of MB231 cells with hyaluronan oligomers.
We found that this treatment induces dissociation of the MCTs
from cell surface CD44 and emmprin, as well as dispersion of the
MCTs and CD44 throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A and B, b, d, f,
and h); because of this dispersion, increased gain is necessary to
facilitate visualization of the MCTs (Fig. 3A, b’ and h’). The
intracellular CD44 and the MCTs seem to be within vesicles and
exhibit decreased colocalization.

v3-containing variant may be preferentially internalized (Fig. 4B,
h and k).
As opposed to CD44 and the MCTs, emmprin was not lost
from the cell membrane to a significant degree in response to
oligomer treatment (Fig. 3A and B, b). Thus we examined the
effects of transfection with emmprin siRNA on localization of CD44
and the MCTs. As previously reported, knockdown of emmprin
expression prevents trafficking of the MCTs to the plasma
membrane and leads to their degradation (16); we confirmed
this decrease in MCT1 and MCT4 at the plasma membrane in our
study (Fig. 5A and B). Interestingly, however, emmprin knockdown
did not cause significant change in localization of CD44 (Fig. 5A
and B, b, d, and f ).
To confirm that internalization of CD44 in response to treatment
with hyaluronan oligomers was an active cellular process, we
examined this effect in live cells by adding Alexa 488–conjugated
CD44 antibody to the medium an hour before fixation. After
fixation, actin filaments were stained with phalloidin. As in the
previous experiments, wherein antibody staining was performed
after fixation, we observed that CD44 became localized within the
cell after oligomer treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1b versus a).
Furthermore, we observed colocalization of CD44 with actin in the
oligomer-treated cells, as well as in the untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1c and d). This agrees with our immunoprecipitation
results showing that h-actin remains attached to CD44 after
treatment of cells with hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 2B, right).
Consistent with a role for actin in these events, we found that
treatment with latrunculin, an inhibitor of actin polymerization
(34), causes clustering of CD44 at the membrane (Supplementary
Fig. S1e) and decreases oligomer-induced internalization of CD44
(Supplementary Fig. S1f ). In separate experiments, wherein cells
were fixed and stained in routine fashion, we found that MCT1
(Supplementary Fig. S1) and MCT4 (data now shown) also
remained clumped at the cell surface, along with CD44, after
latrunculin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1g ) or latrunculin plus
oligomer treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1h).

Discussion
Figure 4. Hyaluronan oligomers, but not hyaluronan polymer, induce
internalization of CD44, CD44v3, and MCT4. A, MB231 cells were treated for
1 h with and without 100 Ag/mL hyaluronan oligomer (oHA ) or polymer (HA ).
After fixation, permeabilization, and blocking of nonspecific binding, the cells
were immunolabeled for CD44 (green) and MCT4 (red) and visualized by
confocal microscopy at a Z plane corresponding to the center of the cell.
Treatment with hyaluronan oligomer, but not polymer, results in internalization
of CD44 and MCT4 from the plasma membrane. B, MB231 cells were treated
and processed as in A but were immunolabeled for CD44 (green ; a, b, c ) and
CD44v3 (red ; d, e, f ). g, h, i, double labeling. Arrows, areas shown at higher
magnification in j, k, and l. CD44, including CD44v3, is present at the plasma
membrane in control and hyaluronan polymer-treated cells. CD44v3 seems to be
internalized preferentially in response to hyaluronan oligomer treatment (h, k,
and b versus e). Representative of three or more independent experiments.

As a control, we compared the effect of hyaluronan oligomers
with that of the hyaluronan polymer from which the oligomers
were prepared. Whereas treatment with the oligomers induced
internalization of CD44 and MCT4, the hyaluronan polymer had
no discernible effects (Fig. 4A). In addition, we analyzed the effects
of hyaluronan oligomers and polymer on v3-containing variant
CD44 and found that the oligomers, but not the polymer, induced
internalization (Fig. 4B). Double staining suggested that the

An almost universal property of malignant cancers is increased
glycolysis, which is detected clinically with positron emission
tomography by increased uptake of the glucose analogue tracer
18
fluorodeoxyglucose in many cancers (8). Fluctuations in hypoxia
most likely lead to increased glycolysis during early stages of tumor
progression, and subsequent adaptations may provide survival
advantages to cancer cells (8). Hypoxia, acidosis, and mitochondrial
defects that are associated with increased glycolysis result in
enhanced malignancy and drug resistance (8–13). An important
outcome of increased glycolysis is lactate production, and lactate
efflux via MCTs is essential to survival of glycolytic cells.
Trafficking of commonly expressed MCTs to the cell surface and
their lactate efflux function at the cell surface are dependent on
interaction with emmprin (4, 16). Conversely, emmprin may require
interaction with MCTs for its stable expression at the cell surface
and, therefore, its activity as an inducer of matrix metalloproteinases and invasiveness (16). We have found that emmprin
stimulates anchorage-independent growth (17), drug resistance
(22), and ErbB2 activation (23) in a hyaluronan-dependent manner.
Thus, we have examined relationships of hyaluronan-CD44
interaction, as well as emmprin to MCT1 and MCT4 localization
and function.

Hyaluronan, CD44, Emmprin Regulate Lactate Transporters

We find that CD44 forms complexes with MCT1, MCT4, and
emmprin at the surface of human breast carcinoma cells and that
these interactions most likely involve a variant form of CD44.
However, further work is required to clarify the specific
involvement of CD44 variants. Perturbation of hyaluronan
interactions by treating the cells with small hyaluronan oligomers
inhibits lactate secretion. Oligomer treatment also leads to
internalization of the hyaluronan receptor, CD44, implying that
the oligomers act via disruption of constitutive hyaluronan
polymer-CD44 interaction (24). Likewise, the oligomers cause
MCT1 and MCT4 to become dissociated from cell surface CD44
and emmprin and to be localized intracellularly. These results
suggest that constitutive hyaluronan-CD44 interaction stabilizes
complexes containing CD44, emmprin, and the MCTs at the plasma
membrane. It is also possible that the oligomers prevent initial
assembly of these complexes and that the loss of MCTs from the
cell surface is due to turnover. However, the latter alternative
seems less likely because the effects of the oligomers on function
take place within 10 to 20 minutes and the effects on
internalization within an hour. Previously, we found a similar role
for hyaluronan-CD44 interaction in assembly or stabilization of
complexes containing CD44, receptor tyrosine kinases, and other
signaling components (23, 33). Other investigators have also

documented analogous relationships between hyaluronan-CD44
interaction and receptor tyrosine kinases (35–38), the Na(+)-H(+)
exchanger 1 (39) and the ATP-binding cassette family drug
transporter, P-glycoprotein (40, 41). It seems then that hyaluronan-CD44 interaction has a wide-ranging effect on numerous
membrane-bound complexes. It remains to be determined whether
this is due to unique interactions with specific subfractions of
CD44, such as different CD44 variants, more general interactions
with membrane compartments, such as lipid rafts, or global effects
of a hyaluronan-based pericellular matrix that influences mechanocellular signaling interactions.
It should be emphasized that constitutive cell surface hyaluronan not only tethers the pericellular matrix to the cell surface but
also forms complexes with numerous other factors that may play a
role in stabilizing membrane-bound complexes (42). Of interest
also is the presence of thin plasma membrane protrusions within
hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrices and their stabilization
by one another (43). These microvilli-like protrusions are enhanced
by overexpression of hyaluronan and destroyed by treatment with
hyaluronidase or disruption of actin filaments. They contain lipid
rafts and, thus, may represent sites of assembly of signaling
complexes. However, although these structures incorporate CD44,
their structure is not dependent on CD44 and is not perturbed by

Figure 5. Emmprin siRNA inhibits membrane localization of MCT1 and MCT4 but not CD44. A, MCT1; B, MCT4. MB231 cells were transfected with emmprin
siRNA and then processed in the same way as in Fig. 3. A and B, a and b (and b’ ) are triple labeled for CD44 (green ), MCT1 or MCT4 (red), and emmprin (blue ); c and
d are double labeled for CD44 and MCT. Arrows, areas shown at higher magnification in the insets. Note that the levels of emmprin are highly reduced after
treatment with emmprin siRNA (b) compared with control siRNA (a). a and c show colocalization in a similar fashion to that shown in Fig. 3. e and f show CD44
only; g and h show the MCTs only. b and d show that CD44 is not significantly internalized after knockdown of emmprin, in contrast to the effect of hyaluronan oligomers
shown in Fig. 3. As explained in Fig. 3, increased gain (A, b’ and h’ ) is necessary to show dispersion of MCT1 in the cytoplasm; a similar result was obtained for
MCT4 (not shown). The increased gain used in b’ also shows that emmprin was not completely eliminated by siRNA treatment. The figure is representative of three or
more independent experiments.

treatment with hyaluronan oligomers (43). Nevertheless, perturbation of pericellular matrices, either with hyaluronan oligomers or
by other means, may lead to destabilization and internalization of
matrix components themselves, as well as associated membrane
complexes. For example, protease-generated fragments of aggrecan
that are complexed with hyaluronan, but not complexes of intact
aggrecan with hyaluronan, are internalized via hyaluronan-CD44
interaction in chondrocytes (44). Further investigation of the
relationships of pericellular matrix composition and perturbation
to plasma membrane–bound complex formation and stability is
needed to clarify these issues.
In addition to the role of hyaluronan-CD44 interactions
discussed above, it is apparent that emmprin cooperates in
regulating the localization, interactions, and activities of the MCTs
and other cell surface complexes. In this study, we found that
treatment with siRNA against emmprin had similar effects on
lactate secretion as the hyaluronan oligomers. In addition, we
showed that emmprin and CD44 coimmunoprecipitate and are
colocalized with one another and with the MCTs. However,
although knockdown of emmprin led to loss of MCTs from the
membrane, it did not cause a corresponding loss of CD44. This and
other observations imply that emmprin knockdown and treatment
with hyaluronan oligomers act via different pathways. Emmprin
knockdown has been shown in previous studies to inhibit
trafficking of MCTs to the plasma membrane (16), whereas the
oligomers most likely induce internalization of membrane-bound
complexes by perturbing CD44 interactions with the MCTs. CD44 is
directly linked to the actin cytoskeleton via factors such as ezrin
and ankyrin (19), and this relationship may underlie the failure of
hyaluronan oligomer-induced internalization of CD44 after treat-

ment with latrunculin. However, perturbing the actin cytoskeleton
disturbs many cellular pathways, including endocytic mechanisms
(45). Also, endocytosis of CD44 seems to occur by an unusual
pathway that does not involve clathrin-coated pits or caveolae (46)
and is regulated by palmitoylation-dependent association with
lipid rafts (47). Further work is clearly necessary to establish the
relationship of actin to internalization of CD44 and associated
macromolecules.
In summary, we have shown here that both CD44 and emmprin
interact with MCT1 and MCT4 at the plasma membrane of
malignant breast carcinoma cells. Perturbation of hyaluronanCD44 interaction or down-regulation of emmprin destabilize or
inhibit assembly of MCT1 and MCT4 complexes in the plasma
membrane and, consequently, suppress lactate efflux. These data
indicate that interactions among hyaluronan, CD44, and emmprin
contribute to the glycolytic phenotype of cancer cells, as well as to
other malignant properties described previously (18, 19).
