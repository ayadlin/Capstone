Targeting the Insulin-like Growth Factor Axis for the
Development of Novel Therapeutics in Oncology
Jin Gao1, Yong S. Chang1,2, Bahija Jallal1, and Jaye Viner1

Abstract
Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) are polypeptide hormones with potent anabolic and mitogenic effects that
regulate cell growth and differentiation. Dysregulation of the IGF axis has been well documented in the
development and progression of multiple types of cancer. As a result, compounds targeting the IGF axis have
become an area of intense preclinical and clinical research for cancer therapeutics. The IGF axis is intimately
involved with the insulin-signaling pathway because of their close homologies. This homology may explain
hurdles encountered in the clinical development of IGF-targeted therapies, such as less-than-expected antitumor
efﬁcacy that may arise from compensatory increases in the activity of insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A), in
response to IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) inhibition and perturbations in glucose homeostasis, arising from the
inhibition of insulin receptor isoform B (IR-B) activity. In this brief review, we compare differentiating factors that
characterize the 3 major classes of IGF-targeting compounds: therapeutic antibodies that target IGF-IR, small
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that inhibit kinase activities of IGF-IR and IR, and antibodies that target IGF
ligands. Cancer Res; 72(1); 3–12. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) are
polypeptide hormones produced mainly by the liver. They
mediate the activity of growth hormone and stimulate the
development of bone and skeletal muscle (for a detailed review,
see ref. 1). The IGFs are also produced locally by various
somatic tissues, making them the only hormones that regulate
cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival via endocrine,
paracrine, and autocrine pathways. The IGFs and insulin
exhibit strong sequence similarities. The primary IGF receptor,
namely IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), shares almost 60% homology
with the insulin receptor (IR). Both IGF-IR and IR belong to the
family of receptor tyrosine kinases. As a result, the IGF-signaling system, often referred to as the IGF axis (Fig. 1A), is
closely linked to insulin signaling. The IGF axis consists of
ligands IGF-I and IGF-II, receptors IGF-IR and IGF-IIR, 6 highafﬁnity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) 1 to 6, and a group of
proteases that degrade IGFBP. The IGFs exert their activities
primarily by binding and activating IGF-IR. Phosphorylation of
IGF-IR recruits the downstream signaling protein insulin
receptor substrate (IRS) 1 to 3 to the cell membrane, which
subsequently activates both phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) path-

ways. IRS proteins also mediate the effects of IR. By contrast,
IGF-IIR lacks intracellular kinase activity and functions as a
scavenger receptor that regulates the bioavailability of IGF-II.
Similarly, the bioavailability of IGFs is closely regulated by
IGFBPs, which also act as carrier proteins.
Two isoforms of IR, IR-A and IR-B, result from posttranscriptional alternative splicing. IR-A is a truncated version of
the IR that lacks exon 11 (36 base pairs that encode 12 amino
acids toward the C-terminus of the alpha subunit). IGF-II has
been shown to bind IR-A with greater afﬁnity than IGF-I. IGF-II
and insulin both stimulate IR-A, which, when activated by IGFII, results in mitogenic effects and increased survival, motility,
and invasiveness of cancer cells (2). In contrast, IR-B is activated by insulin and is mainly responsible for maintaining
glucose homeostasis. Hybrid receptors composed of IGF-IR
and IR, as well as IGF-IR and other receptor tyrosine kinases,
such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
HER2, contribute to complexities of IGF signaling and may
constitute pathways by which cancers resist IGF-targeted
therapies.

Role of IGF Signaling in Cancer
The role of IGFs in the development and progression of a
broad range of epithelial cancers is well documented (3).
Although mutations of IGF-IR have not been found in cancer
cells, increased IGF-signaling activity is associated with many
types of cancer. In addition, downregulation of IGF-IR expression and reduced signaling have been shown to inhibit tumor
growth and increase the susceptibility of cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic agents in vivo (4). Increased expression of
IGF-II and/or IR-A is reported during fetal development and

across a broad range of cancers, including breast, lung, colorectal, thyroid, bladder, primary liver, and various sarcomas.
Although posttranscriptional regulation and expression of
IR-A versus IR-B is not yet fully understood, overexpression
of IR-A and IGF-II (frequently caused by loss of imprinting of
the maternal IGF-II allele in certain tumors) has been proposed
as a potential mechanism of resistance to IGF-IR–directed
therapies (5). This review focuses on 3 major classes of therapeutic compounds targeting the IGF axis currently in clinical
development: antibodies that target IGF-IR, small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that inhibit kinase activities of
IGF-IR and IR, and antibodies that target IGF ligands.

Investigational Compounds That Target the
IGF Axis
Antibodies targeting IGF-IR inhibit the binding of IGF to
IGF-IR. They are furthest along in clinical development of all
IGF-targeting agents. Many of these antibodies induce IGF-IR
internalization and degradation upon binding to the receptor.
Although these antibodies do not bind to IR, many partially
modulate the activity of IR, including IR-B, by binding to IGFIR/IR-A or IGF-IR/IR-B hybrid receptors, which may contribute
to the hyperglycemia observed in clinical testing. These anti-

www.aacrjournals.org

bodies, however, do not inhibit the activation of IR-A homodimers by IGF-II (Fig. 1B).
TKIs are small-molecule compounds that bind to and inhibit
the kinase activity of receptor tyrosine kinases. Because of the
high degree of homology among the kinase domains, the
majority of IGF-IR–targeting TKIs inhibit not only IGF-IR but
also IR-A and IR-B (6). As a result, such TKIs can impair glucose
homeostasis, as shown by transient hyperglycemia documented in clinical trials (6). Small molecules typically have short
half-lives, and although adjusting the dose and schedule might
minimize this adverse effect, it might also reduce efﬁcacy by
intermittent inhibition of IGF-IR and IR (Fig. 1C). Cyclolignan
picropodophyllin (PPP), a unique TKI in early development,
shows potential to circumvent this problem. PPP speciﬁcally
decreases phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue Y1136 of
IGF-IR and leads to IGF-IR downregulation without interfering
with IR activity (7). This molecule apparently does not induce
hyperglycemia in mice, and it was even shown to reduce serum
glucose levels. It will be interesting to learn whether this
molecule affects the activity of IGF-IR/IR hybrid receptors
and, more broadly, to learn whether this activity translates
into an improved therapeutic index in patients with cancer.
Among the few monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that target
IGF ligands instead of the IGF-IR, the only one that has been

clinically tested to date is MEDI-573, an investigational human
monoclonal IgG2l antibody that speciﬁcally binds to both free
IGF-I and IGF-II [dissociation constant (KD) ¼ 294 and 2
picomolar units]. MEDI-573 recognizes epitopes that are
essential for IGF binding to IGF-IR, IR-A, and IGFBP3 and,
thus, renders the IGF ligands biologically inactive (8). MEDI573 inhibits IGF-stimulated phosphorylation of IGF-IR, IR-A,
and the downstream signaling proteins IRS-1, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Importantly, it
does not affect insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRs
and their downstream signaling. MEDI-573 inhibits IGF-II–
induced proliferation of cells that express only IR-A with the
same potency as cells that express only IGF-IR, as well as
heterogeneous cell populations that express both receptors. An
IGF-IR–speciﬁc antibody tested in the same studies did not
inhibit IGF-II activity mediated by IR-A, including in MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells, which express high levels of IR-A
along with moderate levels of IGF-IR that can hybridize with
IR-A receptors. In in vivo studies, MEDI-573 showed close to
90% tumor growth inhibition in mouse 3T3 tumors dependent
on autocrine IGF signaling by ectopically overexpressing
human IGF and IGF-IR. In these IGF-IR–dependent mouse
models, the activity of MEDI-573 was shown to be comparable
to that of IGF-IR–speciﬁc antibodies.
In summary, both IGF-IR and IR-A are involved in IGF
signaling and play signiﬁcant roles in the development and
progression of cancer. As a result, dual inhibition of IR-A and
IGF-IR may improve therapeutic efﬁcacy against IGF-driven
cancers. Antibodies speciﬁc for IGF-IR block IGF-IR and IGFIR/IR-A (or IGF-IR/IR-B) hybrid receptors, but IGF-II stimulation of IR-A homodimers remains intact. Furthermore,
because IGF-IR–speciﬁc antibodies induce internalization
and degradation of IGF-IR, a stoichiometric shift toward
formation of IR-A homodimers may occur and may contribute
to the less-than-expected efﬁcacy signals emerging from clinical trials to date. Small molecule TKIs achieve anticancer
effects by inhibiting both IGF-IR and IRs, and diabetogenic
effects have been documented in clinical trials. Whether a
ligand-neutralizing antibody like MEDI-573 sufﬁciently overcomes IGF activity and compensatory pathways by inhibiting
both IGF-IR and IR-A and, thereby, improves clinical outcomes, without limiting adverse effects, remains a provocative
hypothesis. Selective binding of IGFs by IGFBPs, although still
in early development, shows potential as an alternative to
IGF-IR targeting that also spares IR. IGFBPs regulate IGF
bioavailability and bioactivity, and high IGFBP levels have
been associated with decreased IGF signaling and the antitumoral activity. Thus far, IGFBP3 has shown the greatest
promise owing to antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities
in certain in vitro and in vivo models (9).

Highlights of Clinical Trial Results
The IGF axis has become an increasingly attractive target for
cancer research. Nine large and 6 small molecules have been
tested across approximately 150 phase I to III trials in 16 solid
tumor types and certain hematologic malignancies (e.g., multiple myeloma and leukemia; Table 1). Objective response to

6

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

IGF-IR–targeting mAb monotherapy is rare, with notable
occurrences in approximately 10% of patients with various
sarcomas, in particular the Ewing subset (34). Objective
responses, in some cases durable ones, have been reported in
phase I and phase II studies of mAbs that target IGF-IR (e.g.,
ﬁgitumumab, R1507, and ganitumumab) in adults and children
with heavily pretreated sarcomas. Nevertheless, disease stabilization, deﬁned as lack of objective response or progressive
disease at 12 weeks, remains the overwhelming efﬁcacy signal
(34). IGF-targeting agents are generally expected to show their
full potential by augmenting the efﬁcacy of endocrine, cytotoxic, or other targeted therapies, possibly by mitigating the
development of resistance to otherwise effective interventions.
Although combinations of large or small IGF-targeting
molecules with various standard-of-care therapies have generally shown a reasonable toxicity proﬁle, this strategy has yet
to translate preclinical promise into therapeutic efﬁcacy. Few
of the IGF-IR–targeting antibodies under investigation have
progressed to or completed phase III testing. As recently as
2010, 2 phase III clinical trials were testing ﬁgitumumab
(CP-751,871) globally, one in conjunction with paclitaxel plus
carboplatin [ﬁrst line for stage IV or recurrent nonadenocarcinoma non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)], and another with
erlotinib (second line or greater for refractory and/or relapsed
stage III or IV nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC). Both of these
pivotal ADVancing IGF-IR in Oncology (ADVIGO) trials were
discontinued after data showed an imbalance of serious
adverse events, including mortality, in the arm testing ﬁgitumumab and a low likelihood of meeting the primary endpoint
of improved overall survival (17). Prior testing did not expose
the potential for untoward events to undermine the mAb's
therapeutic beneﬁts. The phase II study of ﬁgitumumab plus
paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin
alone yielded improved objective response rates in the ﬁgitumumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus paclitaxel
plus carboplatin alone treatment arm (54% vs. 42%), and
subset analysis suggested that the addition of ﬁgitumumab
(20 mg/kg) to the paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen might
boost progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio of 0.56,
P ¼ 0.0153) as well as response rate (62% compared with
33%, P ¼ 0.0578) in patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell histology (14). The phase II to III randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of dalotuzumab (MK0646) with cetuximab and irinotecan in patients with KRAS
wild-type stage IV colorectal cancer was stopped prematurely
owing to worsened PFS and overall survival in patients randomized to the dalotuzumab arm (35). A phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ganitumab
(AMG-479) was recently initiated to test the mAb coadministered with gemcitabine in 825 patients with stage IV pancreatic
cancer. Only 1 IGF-targeting TKI has progressed into advanced
clinical testing; linsitinib (OSI-906), an oral small molecule, is
being tested in a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled monotherapy trial in 135 patients with locally
advanced or metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma.
MEDI-573 is the only mAb in clinical testing that exerts its
effects by neutralizing IGF-I and IGF-II ligands instead of by
directly binding to the IGF-IR receptors. Distinct from other

IGF-IR–targeting mAbs under development, MEDI-573 speciﬁcally inhibits IGF signaling through IGF-IR and IR-A, as well
as through their hybrid receptors. The ongoing phase I clinical
trial has shown stabilization of disease 3 months in 7 of
16 patients, most of whom had chemoresistant cancers (33).
Importantly, preliminary data strongly suggest that MEDI-573
might achieve this result without inducing hyperglycemia
(33). If conﬁrmed, this observation would be consistent with
expectations about ligand- versus receptor-based targeting of
the IGF axis, speciﬁcally with respect to the clinical consequences of sparing IR-B and its various hybrid receptors, each
of which has potential to alter glucose metabolism via interactions with insulin.
Transient hyperglycemia has been among the most common
treatment-related toxicities reported for every IGF-IR–targeting antibody and several TKIs. Serious glycemic complications
have been rare, and on the basis of published data, treatmentinduced hyperglycemia is unlikely to be a serious developmental liability for agents targeting the IGF axis. Nevertheless, the
impact of hyperglycemia and associated increases in insulin
levels may mitigate or potentially override antitumoral effects
of drugs that target IGF-IR. One plausible mechanism for
resistance to IGF-IR–targeting therapies may relate to the
unopposed effects of compensatory increases in insulin levels
and associated increases in IGF-I and glucose levels. This
ﬁnding has prompted recommendations to boost efﬁcacy and
reduce toxic consequences through coadministration of a
growth hormone antagonist or glucose-lowering agents. If
IGF-I and IGF-II ligand–neutralizing antibodies directly
achieve the same goal of antitumoral activity with negligible
impact on glucose homeostasis, then studying MEDI-573's
dual-targeting approach becomes even more compelling, particularly in tumors that overexpress IGF-IR or IR-A, either
together or alone.
MEDI-573 recently completed the weekly dose-escalation
phase of ﬁrst-time-in-human testing (exclusively solid tumors),
in which preliminary data have shown negligible perturbations
of glucose homeostasis in nondiabetic patients and no doselimiting toxicities. Treatment-related adverse events from this
ongoing study have been hematologic (anemia, leukopenia),
gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting),
and metabolic and/or nutritional (decreased appetite) disorders, as well as fatigue, all of which have been grade 1 or 2 in
severity (33).

Predictive Biomarkers
The 3 major classes of IGF-targeting compounds currently
under development differ in their mechanisms of action,
ranges of target speciﬁcity, preliminary efﬁcacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety proﬁles. A growing clinical database suggests
that efﬁcacy and toxicity of these compounds may be predicted
by quantiﬁable factors such as tumor IGF-IR or circulating-IGF
ligand levels. Target expression levels such as these, if validated, would serve as relatively straightforward predictive biomarkers for identifying patient subpopulations likely to
respond to IGF-targeted therapies. For IGF-IR antibodies,
elevated tumor IGF-IR expression and circulating IGF-I have

both been shown to correlate to some degree with responses
in early clinical trials. As noted above, data from the phase II
study testing the IGF-IR–speciﬁc mAb ﬁgitumumab in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin in NSCLC showed a
higher objective response rate in the subset of patients with
squamous cell carcinoma histology (78%; n ¼ 11 of 14). Despite
the limited sample size, these data are particularly compelling
in light of biomarker analysis showing the highest IGF-IR
expression in the squamous subtype. In addition, a higher
response rate to the combination of paclitaxel plus carboplatin
and ﬁgitumumab was observed in epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transitional tumors (71%), deﬁned by intermediate E-cadherin
and high IRS-1 expression, compared with those in the mesenchymal-like subset (32%), deﬁned by low expression of both
E-cadherin and IRS-1. By contrast, sample analysis showed
high plasma levels of free IGF-I and vimentin predictive of
clinical beneﬁt in the adenocarcinoma subtype.
Ancillary data from the NSCLC study of ﬁgitumumab
(described immediately above) showed improved PFS among
patients with high pretreatment-free IGF-I levels (at least 0.54
ng/mL; PFS > 6 months, P ¼ 0.007) compared with patients
with low pretreatment-free IGF-I levels (PFS < 3 months, P ¼
0.026), pointing to the potential role of this ligand as a
predictive marker (36). These intriguing data are indirectly
supported by interim results from a phase I to II study of
ﬁgitumumab in 31 patients with relapsed sarcoma, which suggested that pretreatment plasma levels of IGF-I > 110 ng/mL
conferred a signiﬁcant treatment advantage compared with
lower levels (10.5 vs. 4.5 months overall survival, P < 0.001). In
aggregate, these data suggest the value of evaluating circulating IGF-I as a possible predictive marker in studies of IGFtargeting agents and opportunities for enriching future study
populations (34).
A growing body of nonclinical and clinical data provide
valuable lessons for the development of ligand-based
approaches (such as MEDI-573) in terms of patient selection.
In particular, they provide a compelling rationale for a priori
identiﬁcation of patients with tumors that overexpress IR-A
and IGF-II in addition to IGF-IR, which may prove a critical
determinant of clinical response to monotherapy or combination regimens in molecularly deﬁned subpopulations. This
hypothesis has been supported by preclinical studies (8, 37) in
which high levels of IR expression and elevated mRNA levels of
IR-A compared with IR-B have been found in most of the
cancer cell lines tested. Other molecular markers may also
predict tumor response to IGF-targeting compounds. IRS-1
expression levels have been positively correlated with sensitivity of preclinical models to IGF-IR targeting (38). Increased
VEGF production by cancer cells following rapamycin treatment has been shown to correlate with synergistic responses
to rapamycin and IGF-IR antibody–combined therapy in certain sarcoma tumor models (39). Finally, elevated genomic
signatures associated with IGF-I signaling, evaluated by wholegenome array analysis, have been associated with worse prognosis in patients with estrogen receptor–positive compared
with estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer (40).
Among the cancers associated with dysregulation of the
IGF axis, increased IGF-II/IR-A signaling has been best

documented in breast cancer, in which conventional criteria
(e.g., estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor and/or
HER2 status, stage, grade, luminal type A vs. type B) together
with IR-A signatures may enable identiﬁcation of and enrichment for subpopulations likely to respond to dual targeting of
IGF-IR and IR-A (41). MEDI-573 has been shown to inhibit
IGF-induced proliferation of cells expressing IGF-IR or IR-A,
either together or alone, pointing to a distinct theoretical
advantage over IGF-IR–targeting antibodies in selected populations. A global clinical trial is currently testing whether
MEDI-573 in conjunction with an aromatase inhibitor
enhances therapeutic outcomes in patients with advanced
estrogen receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.
Whether these markers achieve the level of validation required
to predict for sensitivity to different types of IGF-targeted
agents has yet to be conﬁrmed by clinical testing.

Conclusions
The IGF axis has emerged as a meaningful therapeutic
target for oncology drug development that is strongly supported by preclinical studies and promising results from
early phase clinical trials. Nevertheless, this complex system
presents distinct developmental challenges, and demonstration of meaningful clinical beneﬁt remains elusive. The 3

major classes of IGF-targeted therapeutic compounds (i.e.,
IGF-IR–speciﬁc mAbs, small molecule TKIs targeting IGF-IR
and IR kinase domains, and an IGF-I and IGF-II ligand–
neutralizing mAb) differ in the range of target inhibition based on their ability to block activation of IGF-IR,
IGF-IR/IR-A hybrid, and IR-A. They also exhibit different
safety proﬁles, most notably with respect to modulation of
glucose metabolism, as well as through changes in circulating levels of IGF, insulin, and growth hormone. Although
agents that target the IGF axis typically have acceptable
toxicity proﬁles alone and in combination with chemotherapy, no speciﬁc factors have been conclusively associated
with improved clinical outcomes. The identiﬁcation of patient subsets likely to respond to IGF-targeting strategies and
selection of rational companion therapeutics are expected to
pave the way for signiﬁcant improvements in clinical outcomes and provide critical direction for multifunctional,
pathway-driven approaches to cancer treatment.
