BACKGROUND: Nilotinib is a selective, potent BCR-ABL inhibitor. Previous studies demonstrated the efficacy and
safety of nilotinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia patients in chronic phase (CML-CP)
or accelerated phase who failed prior imatinib. METHODS: This expanded access trial further characterized the safety
of nilotinib 400 mg twice daily in patients with CML-CP (N ¼ 1422). RESULTS: In this large, heavily pretreated population, nilotinib demonstrated significant efficacy, with complete hematologic response and complete cytogenetic
response achieved in 43% and 34% of patients, respectively. Responses were rapid, mostly occurring within 6 months,
and were higher in patients with suboptimal response to imatinib, with 75% and 50% achieving major cytogenetic
response and complete cytogenetic response, respectively. At 18 months, the progression-free survival rate was 80%.
Most patients achieved planned dosing of 400 mg twice daily and maintained the dose >12 months. Nonhematologic
adverse events (AEs) were mostly mild to moderate and included rash (28%), headache (25%), and nausea (17%).
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (22%), neutropenia (14%), and anemia (3%) were low and managed by dose reduction or brief interruption. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in serum bilirubin and lipase occurred in 4% and 7% of patients,
respectively. The incidence of newly occurring AEs decreased over time. Of patients who experienced a dose reduction because of AEs and attempted a re-escalation, 87% successfully achieved re-escalation to the full dose.
CONCLUSIONS: This large study confirms that nilotinib was well tolerated and that grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred infreC 2011 American Cancer
quently and were manageable through transient dose interruptions. Cancer 2012;118:118-26. V

as the standard of care for CML after results from the pivotal phase 3 International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) trial showed substantially better
efficacy and safety for the patients in the imatinib treatment arm.3
Nilotinib was rationally designed to be a more
potent and selective adenosine triphosphate-competitive
inhibitor of BCR-ABL than imatinib, while maintaining
a high level of activity against imatinib-resistant mutant
forms of the enzyme.4,5 Initial clinical trials demonstrated
a favorable safety profile for nilotinib and confirmed the
efficacy observed in preclinical animal models of leukemic
disease.6-8
In a pivotal phase 1-2 trial in patients with imatinibresistant or imatinib-intolerant CML in chronic phase
(CML-CP) and CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP),
nilotinib produced rapid and durable hematologic and
cytogenetic response rates, with a manageable safety profile.9 In 321 patients with CML-CP, the rate of major
cytogenetic response was 59%, with 44% of patients
achieving complete cytogenetic response at 24 months.9
Most responders achieved their response rapidly, within 3
months of starting nilotinib treatment. Nilotinib was generally well tolerated, with infrequent occurrence of grade
3 or 4 nonhematologic and hematologic adverse events
(AEs). On the basis of these data, nilotinib has gained approval in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinibintolerant Phþ CML-CP and CML-AP in >50 countries,
including the United States and the countries of the European Union. Nilotinib has also gained regulatory approval
in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and
other countries for the treatment of patients with newly
diagnosed CML-CP.
The Expanding Nilotinib Access in Clinical Trials
(ENACT) multinational trial is the largest safety trial of
any tyrosine kinase inhibitor in CML to date and evaluated the safety profile of nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant Phþ CML in all
phases. The ENACT study was initiated to provide
patients with Phþ CML who failed prior imatinib with
access to nilotinib before regulatory approval. It was
anticipated that the size of this study, as well as the inclusion of patients heavily pretreated with other therapeutic
regimens, would provide data that would more closely
reflect patients observed in everyday clinical practice,
which would provide physicians with guidance on how to
manage CML patients treated with nilotinib. Although
testing efficacy was not an objective of this study, guidelines for minimal efficacy assessment were included in the

protocol, and data on investigators’ assessment of
response were collected. The results presented a detailed
safety analysis for only the CML-CP patient cohort enrolled between January 2006 and June 2007 and up to the
data cutoff date of June 2, 2008.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Eligibility
This international multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized expanded access trial, conducted at 310 centers
worldwide, enrolled patients between January 2006 and
June 2007. Written informed consent was obtained
before any study procedures were performed. The study
and amendments were reviewed by the ethics committees
and review boards for each participating center. The study
was conducted according to the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Male or female patients at least 18 years of age were
eligible for entry if they had imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant Phþ CML-CP, CML-AP, or CML in blast
crisis. Chronic phase was defined as <15% blasts and
<30% of blasts plus promyelocytes in peripheral blood
and bone marrow, at least 50  109/L (50,000/mm3) platelets, and no evidence of extramedullary leukemic
involvement, excluding liver and spleen.
Inclusion criteria required patients to have World
Health Organization Performance Status of 2, serum
electrolytes within normal limits, and adequate hepatic,
renal, and pancreatic function. Patients with concurrent
severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions, abnormal
cardiac function, clinically significant heart disease, and
cytopathologically confirmed central nervous system infiltration were excluded from the trial. Any prolongation of
the QT interval, as calculated using the QTcF formula,
must have been <450 milliseconds at baseline for a
patient to be eligible for the study.
Imatinib resistance in CP was defined as any of the
following during imatinib therapy: failure to achieve a
complete hematologic response (CHR) after 3 months of
imatinib therapy; failure to achieve at least a minimal
cytogenetic response (Phþ 95%) at 6 months or major
cytogenetic response after 12 months (Phþ 35%); or
loss of CHR, minimal cytogenetic response, major cytogenetic response, or increase in bone marrow Phþ metaphase cells by 30% on 2 separate occasions. In addition,
patients with clonal evolution who did not meet any of
the other criteria outlined above were eligible for enrollment. To be eligible for the study, patients must have

received prior imatinib therapy 600 mg/d for a minimum of 3 months, unless they met the following 4 criteria: 1) they met the criteria outlined below for the
definition of imatinib intolerance; 2) there was evidence
of disease progression (a doubling of white blood cells,
basophils, blasts, or platelets) documented on 2 separate
occasions at least 1 week apart; 3) there was presence of
grade 3 or 4 disease-related symptoms (bone pain, fever,
weight loss, anorexia); or 4) mutations in the BCR-ABL
kinase domain (at amino acids L248, G250, Q252, Y253,
E255, T315, F317, or H396) were detected.
Patients were defined as imatinib intolerant if they
had discontinued imatinib therapy because of grade 3 or 4
AEs that persisted despite optimal supportive care measures, or experienced grade 2 AEs related to imatinib therapy that persisted for >1 month or that recurred >3,
whether the dose was reduced or discontinued.
Treatment With Nilotinib
All patients received oral nilotinib at a dose of 400 mg
twice daily. This dose was selected based on the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic profile in the phase 1-2 registration study. Patients were instructed to fast for at least 2
hours before and 1 hour after taking nilotinib. Dose escalation of nilotinib >400 mg twice daily was not permitted. Dose reduction to 400 mg once daily or interruption
was allowed for the management of toxicity, with re-escalation to 400 mg twice daily permitted after resolution of
AEs to grade 1 severity at the discretion of the investigator. For all other toxicities considered by the investigator
to be unlikely to develop into serious or life-threatening
events, treatment was continued at the same dose without
reduction or interruption. Permanent discontinuation of
nilotinib was indicated in the event of recurrent unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, or if the patient was
no longer benefiting from treatment. In addition, recurrent grade 2 or higher biochemical abnormalities, such as
hyperbilirubinemia, also mandated permanent discontinuation, even if the AE was asymptomatic. At the time of
discontinuation (before or at the end of this 1-year study),
patients could enter another nilotinib study if nilotinib
was not commercially available.
Cancer therapies other than nilotinib were prohibited while patients were enrolled in the study, with the
exception of hydroxyurea and anagrelide (to control elevated blast and/or platelet counts). Concomitant medications and therapies deemed necessary for the supportive
care and safety of the patient were allowed, including colony-stimulating growth factors (granulocyte colony stim-

120

ulating factor [CSF] and granulocyte macrophage CSF)
for grade 3 neutropenia and recombinant erythropoietin
for anemia. For safety, medications known to prolong the
QT interval or inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzyme
CYP3A4 were contraindicated unless deemed to be
absolutely necessary. Use of coumarin derivatives was
prohibited.
Patient Evaluation
Baseline assessments were performed within 4 weeks
before the first administration of nilotinib. Mandatory
safety evaluations included physical examination, weight,
vital signs, performance status, blood and serum chemistries, urinalysis, chest x-ray, and cardiac assessments,
including multiple gated acquisition scan or echocardiogram, and 12-lead electrocardiogram. Those with any abnormality in their chest x-ray were monitored by repeated
x-rays as clinically indicated.
AEs were evaluated throughout the study and graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Unlike
other clinical trials, in this expanded access study, laboratory tests were performed as scheduled in the protocol,
but the results were not recorded. Only laboratory abnormalities with grading information were recorded as AEs.
To better characterize the frequency of these events, the
laboratory abnormality-related AEs were grouped by
selected preferred terms. The safety population consisted
of all patients who received at least 1 dose of nilotinib and
had at least 1 postbaseline safety assessment.
Although testing efficacy was not an objective of this
study, the investigators’ assessment of response was recommended. Efficacy assessments of hematologic and
cytogenetic response and disease progression, performed
every 6 months at a minimum, included hematologic
analysis, bone marrow cytogenetics, and evaluation of
extramedullary disease and cancer-related symptoms to
ensure that nilotinib was being provided to patients who
were responding and that patients who progressed could
discontinue therapy. Hematologic responses were determined by assessment of complete blood counts and categorized by CHR and marrow response/no evidence of
leukemia. Patients with progressive disease and without
CHR or marrow response were considered nonresponders. All patients who achieved a CHR or marrow response
were assessed for a cytogenetic response based on the proportion of Phþ metaphases from at least 20 metaphase
cells from bone marrow aspirates or biopsies. In cases
where the standard metaphase cytogenetics were either

unsuccessful or unavailable, fluorescent in situ hybridization performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow was
used. Cytogenetic response was defined according to the
percentage of Phþ cells in metaphase: complete cytogenetic response (Phþ 0%), partial cytogenetic response
(Phþ range, 1%-35%), minor (Phþ range, 36%-65%),
and minimal (Phþ range, 66%-95%). Major cytogenetic
response was defined as the number of complete cytogenetic responses plus the number of partial cytogenetic
responses. Patients with minor or minimal cytogenetic
responses were considered neither responders nor nonresponders. Patients who discontinued nilotinib before either hematologic or cytogenetic response assessment at a
given time point were considered to be nonresponders for
that time point. In centers reporting molecular response
data, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (Q-RT-PCR) assessment of BCR-ABL was performed every 3 months according to International Stand-

defined as BCR-ABL/ABL ratio 0.1%IS. Major molecular response and BCR-ABL/ABL ratios 0.003%IS were
reported.
Statistical Analysis
The data were summarized with respect to demographic
and baseline characteristics, efficacy evaluation, and safety
observations and measurements. Continuous variables
were summarized by mean, standard deviation, median,
minimum, maximum (25% and 75% quartiles, as appropriate), and number of patients without missing data.
Categorical variables were summarized by frequencies and
percentages and by disease stage classifications. For efficacy evaluation, the number and percentage of responders
are presented as well as the associated 95% confidence
interval (CI). The efficacy analysis was conducted in the
intent to treat population based on patients who had
at least 1 postbaseline assessment on or before month 6
assessment, or who discontinued before response assessment. The safety analysis includes all patients who
received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at
least 1 postbaseline safety assessment.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Disposition
The ENACT CML-CP patient cohort consisted of 1422
patients (696 males, 726 females) enrolled between January 2006 and the data cutoff of June 2, 2008 at 310 centers worldwide. The median age of patients with CMLCP was 53 years (range, 17-85 years). The majority of
patients were imatinib resistant (59.6%) (Table 1). The
median duration of disease since diagnosis was 55.1
months (range, 2-328 months). Patients were heavily pretreated. Greater than 70% of patients had been treated
with 600 mg/d imatinib at study entry. Other than imatinib, the most common prior antineoplastic therapies
were hydroxycarbamide (85.7%), interferons (45.4%),
cytarabine (24.3%), dasatinib (15.3%), and busulfan
(7.6%). Furthermore, 77 CML-CP patients (5.4%) had
received prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
This was also a very resistant patient population, with
<1=3 of patients having achieved CHR on prior therapy.
Up to the data cutoff date of June 2, 2008, 60.3% of
patients completed the study on nilotinib. The most common reasons for discontinuation of nilotinib therapy were
drug-related toxicity (14.3%) and an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (15.6%).

Nilotinib Treatment
The median duration of exposure of patients with CMLCP to nilotinib was 266 days (range, 1-807 days), with
36.4% of patients receiving nilotinib for 12 months.
The median nilotinib dose delivered was 782.5 mg/d
(range, 104.3-937.9 mg/d), very close to the planned dose
of 800 mg/d. The maximum dose of nilotinib in the aforementioned range is because of a dose escalation of 4 of
1422 patients (<1%) who were treated with at least 1
daily dose of nilotinib 600 mg twice daily in error. These
4 patients have been included in the analysis. The median
dose intensity (total amount of drug received divided by
the number of days on treatment, including days of zero
dose) of nilotinib did not change over time on study. Over
progressive 3-month periods from initiation of therapy to
>12 months of therapy, nilotinib dose intensity was consistently high, between 794 and 800 mg/d (Fig. 1).
Dose reductions and interruptions lasting >5 days
occurred in 5.1% and 41.4% of patients, respectively, and
were most commonly because of AEs. The total duration
of dose interruptions was quite short, with a median of
only 11 days (range, 1-188 days). Re-escalation of nilotinib to the full planned dose after dose reduction was not
mandated in the protocol, but was permitted at the discretion of the investigator. Of 444 patients who received a
dose reduction of nilotinib to 400 mg once daily and
attempted re-escalation to 400 mg twice daily, 385 (87%)
successfully re-escalated the dose back to 400 mg twice
daily for at least 28 days without a dose interruption of
>5 days. The ability to successfully re-escalate nilotinib
did not differ across age groups (<60, 60, 70 years).
Safety and Tolerability
Nilotinib was well tolerated, with only 14.3% of all
patients having to discontinue treatment as a result of AEs

(with some of these as protocol-mandated discontinuations because of second episodes of asymptomatic
biochemical laboratory abnormalities) after a median follow-up of 266 days (range, 1-807 days). The most frequently reported nonhematologic AEs (any grade)
suspected to be drug-related were hyperbilirubinemia
(25.2%), rash (24.5%), headache (16.4%), and fatigue
(14.1%), and these were mostly of mild to moderate
(grade 1 or 2) intensity (Table 2). The most common
grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic AE was lipase elevation
(6.5%). In addition to hyperbilirubinemia and elevated
lipase, increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were reported in
13.6% and 8.5% of patients, respectively, although the
incidence of severe (grade 3 or 4) aminotransferase elevation was low (2.1% and 0.8%, respectively).

For each AE, only the first occurrence per patient is analyzed.

First occurrence of most frequent biochemical laboratory AEs (lipase elevation, hyperbilirubinemia, ALT/
AST elevation) were within the first 2 months of therapy
and were transient, lasting a median duration of 1 to 2
weeks (Table 3). These abnormalities were typically
asymptomatic and managed with protocol-mandated
dose reductions or brief dose interruptions when needed.
Concomitant medications were infrequently used to treat
laboratory abnormalities.
The incidence of all grade 3 or 4 AEs decreased over
time. The percentage of patients with at least 1 AE
decreased from the first 90 days of treatment (35%) to the
second 90 days of treatment (19%). Of the 19% of
patients with an AE in the second 90 days, only 13% had
a newly occurring AE.
Thrombocytopenia was the most commonly occurring hematologic AE, with grade 3 or 4 events occurring
in 21.7% of patients. Neutropenia and anemia were experienced by 17.2% and 11.3% of patients with CML-CP,
respectively, at all grades, and 14.3% and 3.2%, respectively, at grade 3 or 4 (Table 2). Myelosuppression was
generally manageable with dose reductions or interruptions, and was associated with discontinuation in only a
small proportion of patients (6.4% discontinued because
of thrombocytopenia; 2.7% because of neutropenia). Platelet transfusions and growth factor use occurred in 16%
and 15% of patients experiencing thrombocytopenia and
neutropenia events, respectively.
The most commonly observed drug-related grade 3
or 4 hepatobiliary disorder was hyperbilirubinemia in 59
patients (4.1%). However, hepatobiliary disorders overall
only resulted in 8 treatment discontinuations. Similarly,
despite the elevation in serum lipase levels, severe clinical
pancreatitis was only observed in 10 patients (0.7%).

Only 4 of these patients discontinued nilotinib because of
the pancreatitis. Eleven patients with CML-CP (0.1%)
had grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia suspected of being studydrug related, and only 1 patient (0.1%) discontinued
because of hyperglycemia.
Extensive cardiac monitoring was performed at
baseline and throughout the study. Although absolute
QTc interval of >480 milliseconds occurred in 30
patients (2.1%), an absolute QTc interval of >500 milliseconds was rare, occurring in only 4 patients (0.3%).
QTc increases from baseline of >60 milliseconds were
also rare, occurring in only 1.3% of patients. No patients
with absolute QTc prolongation >500 milliseconds or
QTc prolongation >60 milliseconds above baseline values reported any later cardiac serious AEs. The number of
QTc prolongation events decreased over time (conditional probability of .0141 in first 3 months of therapy vs
.0068 in months 3-6), and there were no incidences of
torsades de pointes.
In total, 19 of 1422 (1.3%) patients with CML-CP
died either during the study or within 28 days of discontinuing nilotinib. Very few deaths could be linked
unequivocally to nilotinib treatment. Three deaths were
classified by the sponsor as sudden deaths and occurred on
study or within 28 days after discontinuation of nilotinib:
1 death after triple-bypass surgery, not suspected to be
study drug related; 1 death of unknown cause, suspected
to be study drug related; and 1 death possibly related to
study drug and/or moxifloxacin. All had prior cardiac history (but not excluding them from study.) There were no
cardiac failures. There were 3 cardiac-related deaths, none
of which were suspected to be related to the study drug.
The safety profile of nilotinib was consistent across age
groups (<60, 60, 70 years).

Efficacy
Best hematologic and cytogenetic responses (investigator
assessment) to nilotinib for the overall study were similar
to prior reports.9 All 1422 patients had at least 1 postbaseline cytogenetic assessment during the study, or discontinued before response assessment. A hematologic response
was achieved in 63% of patients. Overall, 43% and 20%
of patients achieved CHR or a marrow response, respectively. With regard to cytogenetic response, 45% of
patients achieved major cytogenetic response, with the
majority of responses (approximately 75%) being complete cytogenetic response (34% overall). Responses to
nilotinib were higher in the subset of patients with prior
suboptimal response to imatinib (definition retrospectively applied to patients based on 6-month and
12-month cytogenetic response data), with 75% and 50%
achieving major cytogenetic response and complete
cytogenetic response, respectively. Moreover, the efficacy
of nilotinib was consistent across age groups (<60, 60,
70 years).
Complete efficacy data collection was performed in
the subset of ENACT patients (n ¼ 168) from France.
The number of French patients achieving major cytogenetic response (54%) and complete cytogenetic response
(45%) was higher than in the overall patient population
(45% and 34%, respectively). French patients were also
monitored for molecular response by Q-RT-PCR at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. As shown in Figure 2,
37% of the French subset of patients achieved major molecular response by 12 months, with nearly 20% of all

French patients achieving a molecular response of BCRABL/ABL 0.003%IS.
It is important to note that all response monitoring
was conducted via investigator assessment of both hematologic and cytogenetic results; no central laboratories
were used for these assessments. Although complete blood
counts were frequently performed, assessment of hematologic response was only reported on case report forms at
the time of bone marrow assessment every 6 months.
In the overall cohort of ENACT patients, the time
to progression (progression was as assessed by investigator) or death for the at-risk population is shown in Figure
3. At 18 months, the estimated rate of progression-free
survival (defined as progression to AP, blast crisis, or death
because of any cause) was 80% (95% CI, 0.77-0.83) for
the at-risk population.

DISCUSSION
The ENACT international, multicenter, expanded access
study further evaluated the safety of nilotinib in a large
patient population that more closely resembles clinical
practice. The trial also provided patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant Phþ CML in all phases
expanded access to nilotinib, outside of a registration
study. Before regulatory approval of nilotinib, these
patients had limited therapeutic options. The data from
ENACT presented in this report extend the findings of
the earlier, pivotal phase 2 study, affirming the safety of
nilotinib in patients with Phþ CML-CP who have been
heavily treated with prior antineoplastic therapies.
As in the phase 2 registration trial, nilotinib was well
tolerated.9 Patients achieved a median dose intensity of
782.5 mg/d, very close to the planned dose for the trial
(800 mg/d), despite dose escalation not being permitted.
The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity
and could be adequately managed by dose modification

or supportive treatment. Cytopenias were the most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 AEs; they were managed
effectively by dose reduction or interruption and seldom
caused nilotinib discontinuation (<8% of patients). Most
AEs first occurred within the first 2 months of therapy
and were short, lasting a median duration of 1 to 3 weeks.
The vast majority of patients who attempted dose re-escalation after reductions for AEs or other reasons were able
to do so successfully.
A consistent spectrum of AEs was observed in this
trial compared with the phase 1-2 registration trial of
nilotinib, and no new safety signals were observed compared with findings from the nilotinib registration program.9 Although 6.5% (93 of 1422) of patients
experienced grade 3 or 4 elevations in lipase, only 10
patients (0.7%) experienced pancreatitis, and only 4
patients (0.3%) discontinued because of the pancreatitis.
Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 4.1% (59
of 1422) of patients, and only 2 patients (0.1%) discontinued the study for this reason. Thus, these effects were
clinically manageable and usually resolved with continued therapy with or without dose reduction. Reports of
edema or pleural effusion associated with nilotinib in
this large cohort of patients were quite rare, with both
occurring in 0.1% of patients. This is significant
because a chest x-ray was performed in all patients at
baseline. Those with any clinically relevant chest x-ray
abnormality (27 of 1422 patients) or pleural effusion
(13 of 27 patients) at baseline were monitored by
repeated x-rays as clinically indicated. Twelve of the 13
patients with pleural effusions at baseline received dasatinib before the start of the study. None of these 12
patients had reported any AE related to pleural effusion
while receiving nilotinib. Only 1 grade 3 or 4 pleural
effusion was observed on nilotinib therapy. Overall, the
safety profile of this large cohort was consistent with
that observed in the nilotinib phase 1-2 registration trial
that included 321 patients with CML-CP.
Safety assessments in the nilotinib phase 1-2 registration trial showed that significant prolongation of QTc
intervals rarely occurred.10 Nevertheless, information on
the incidence of these events in a similar patient population is largely unknown because of the lack of available
age-matched and disease-matched controls. This study
confirms that the incidence of significantly prolonged
QTc intervals (>500 milliseconds) was rare and occurred
in only 4 of 1422 patients (0.3%). Furthermore, no
patients with absolute QTc prolongation of >500 milliseconds or increase from baseline of >60 milliseconds

reported any later cardiac serious AEs. This large study
also confirms the significant hematologic and cytogenetic
responses to nilotinib observed in the registration study in
patients with Phþ CML-CP.9
In summary, the results of this phase 3 trial in a
large patient population provide important supportive
safety data and confirm earlier published findings of
nilotinib in pivotal phase 1-2 studies. Safety and efficacy
results were consistent across age groups, including in
very elderly patients (70 years). Because clinical trial
populations tend to have much lower median ages than
would typically be seen in a real clinical setting, establishing the safety and efficacy of nilotinib in older
patients with such a large international dataset was an
important finding. Overall, these data support the excellent toxicity and efficacy profile for selective BCR-ABL
inhibition with nilotinib at 400 mg twice daily in
patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant
CML-CP.
