Abstract
Eker rats heterozygous for a dominant germline mutation in
the tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2) tumor suppressor gene were
used as a model to study renal carcinogenesis. Eker and
corresponding wild-type rats were exposed to genotoxic
aristolochic acid (AA) or non-genotoxic ochratoxin A (OTA)
to elucidate early carcinogen-specific gene expression changes
and to test whether Eker rats are more sensitive to carcinogeninduced changes in gene expression. Male Eker and wild-type
rats were gavaged daily with AA (10 mg/kg body weight) or
OTA (210 Mg/kg body weight). After 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of
exposure, renal histopathology, tubular cell proliferation, and
Affymetrix gene expression profiles from renal cortex/outer
medulla were analyzed. AA-treated Eker and wild-type rats
were qualitatively comparable in all variables assessed,
suggesting a Tsc2-independent mechanism of action. OTA
treatment resulted in slightly increased cortical pathology and
significantly elevated cell proliferation in both strains,
although Eker rats were more sensitive. Deregulated genes
involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-Tsc2-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, among other important
genes prominent in tumorigenesis, in conjunction with the
enhanced cell proliferation and presence of preneoplastic
lesions suggested involvement of Tsc2 in OTA-mediated
toxicity and carcinogenicity, especially as deregulation of
genes involved in this pathway was more prominent in the
Tsc2 mutant Eker rat. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4052–68]

Introduction
Eker rats, heterozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in the
tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2) tumor suppressor gene, seem ideal
models to study the etiology of renal carcinogenesis (1, 2). Heredity
of the Tsc2 mutation follows Mendelian genetics (1, 3), and
heterozygous progeny are predisposed to spontaneous development of multiple bilateral renal neoplasms originating from the
proximal tubular epithelium with complete penetrance by 1 year of
age (4). Approximately 60% of the spontaneous renal tumors in
Eker rats also exhibit a functional inactivation of the second Tsc2
allele, suggesting, in accordance with Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis,
that a second somatic mutation might be the rate-limiting step for

the development of renal cell carcinomas in Eker rats (5). Eker rats
have been employed to elucidate the mechanism of renal
carcinogens, primarily using histopathologic and statistical analyses of the number, multiplicity, and progression of renal lesions
(6, 7). Accordingly, treatment of Eker rats with dimethylnitrosamine resulted in a 70-fold increase in the induction of renal
adenomas and carcinomas, when compared with wild-type rats (6).
No increased lesion incidence, albeit an advanced lesion progression, was observed in Eker rats subchronically treated with the
tumor promoter sodium barbital (7). Although the latter data highlight that Eker rats are sensitive to genotoxic and non-genotoxic
compounds, the involvement of Tsc2 protein (tuberin) in renal
carcinogenesis remains to be established. Several studies suggest
that functional Tsc2 promotes the GTP hydrolysis of the Ras
homologue Rheb, thereby acting as a negative regulator of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-Tsc1/2-Rheb-mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Consequently, Tsc2 is suspected to play a central role in mediating growth factor, nutrient,
and energy sensing to regulate cell growth, proliferation, migration,
and differentiation (8).
The objective of this study was to elucidate whether short-term
exposure of Eker and wild-type rats to a non-genotoxic and a
genotoxic renal carcinogen would result in compound-specific
changes in renal nonneoplastic and preneoplastic pathology and
cell proliferation rates. Subsequently, the hypothesis was investigated, whether compound-specific changes in histopathology and
cell proliferation can be associated with respective changes in gene
expression, and whether Eker and wild-type rats respond differently.
This should allow identification of deregulated genes involved in
known and novel pathways possibly mediating carcinogen-induced
renal tumorigenesis. Accordingly, Eker and wild-type rats were
treated with daily doses of the genotoxic and the non-genotoxic
renal carcinogen aristolochic acid (AA) and ochratoxin A (OTA),
respectively, for which renal tumor induction in long-term in vivo
studies was previously shown (refs. 9, 10; see Supplementary Fig. S1
for compound structures).
Indeed, intragastric administration of 10 mg AA/kg body weight/
day [representing a mixture of structurally related nitrophenanthrene carboxylic acids (mostly AAI and AAII)] to rats over 3
months was shown to induce tumors in the forestomach, kidney,
and the urinary bladder (9). DNA reactivity of AA was confirmed in
that the most frequent and persistent dAdenin-AAI adduct could
lead to mutation and activation of the H-ras oncogene in the
forestomach but not in kidneys of rats (11, 12) or to p53 mutations
in urothelial tumors of humans (13). Despite the lack of H-ras
mutations, higher levels of AA adducts were found in renal tissues
than in the forestomach of orally treated Wistar rats (5 mg AA/kg
body weight/day) after only 1 week of exposure (14), suggesting
an H-ras–independent pathway of renal tumor induction. The

Carcinogen-Specific Gene Expression Profiles in Rats

genotoxic properties of AA are explained by the metabolic
activation of AA by several phase I enzymes to a DNA-reactive
aristolactam-nitriumion (15–17). Similarly, the mycotoxin OTA
increased the incidence of renal adenoma and carcinoma in rats
when exposed for up to 2 years to dietary OTA (18) or 210 Ag
OTA/kg body weight/day via gavage (10). However, as OTA has not
been convincingly shown to covalently interact with DNA, a nongenotoxic mechanism of action is assumed (19, 20).
The comparison of cell proliferation, pathology, and expression
profiles of AA- and OTA-treated Eker and wild-type rats should
allow for a more in-depth understanding of the involvement of the
Tsc2-mTOR pathway as well as of other early gene expression
changes in the etiology of carcinogen-induced renal tumors.

Materials and Methods
Compounds. OTA (>98% purity, benzene-free) was kindly provided by
Dr. M.E. Stack (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC). AA
sodium salt mixture (41% AAI and 56% AAII) was purchased from SigmaAldrich.
Animals. Six- to 10-week-old genotyped heterozygous Tsc2 mutant Eker
rats (Tsc2 +/ , Long Evans) were purchased from the M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center and maintained at the University of Konstanz animal research
facility under standard conditions with food and water ad libitum. Male rats
were randomly assigned to dose groups [three animals per compound (or
vehicle) and time point] and allowed to acclimatize to laboratory conditions
for 4 weeks. Two weeks before exposure, rats were handled daily to reduce
non–compound-related stress during exposure.
Heterozygous Eker rats were bred, and wild-type (Tsc2 +/+) genotypes of
the progeny were determined via PCR (21). Two weeks before exposure,
8- to 9-week-old genotyped male wild-type rats were randomly allocated
to dose groups and accustomed to daily handling (see above).
Animal treatment and sample collection. Eker and wild-type rats were
gavaged daily with OTA (210 Ag/ kg body weight) or AA (10 mg/ kg body
weight) dissolved in 0.1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate. Time-matched vehicle
controls were gavaged with 0.1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate. Following 1, 3, 7,
and 14 days of treatment, Narcoren (pentobarbital)–anesthetized rats were
sacrificed by exsanguination subsequent to retrograde perfusion with PBS.
Left kidneys were collected, cross-sectioned into 5-mm slices, and stored in
RNAlater (Qiagen) or in PBS-buffered histology fixative buffer containing 2%
paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde for subsequent paraffin embedding and sectioning.
Histopathology. For histopathologic examinations, H&E-stained sections were randomized, and pathologic analysis was carried out by light
microscopy at 40- to 400-fold magnification. Nonneoplastic changes were
classified as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), strong (3), and severe (4),
including intermediate classes (e.g., 0.5, 1.5, etc.), whereas total numbers of
preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions were counted.
Immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) using
monoclonal primary anti-PCNA antibody (PC-10; DAKO) in paraffinembedded kidney sections.
Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated in a decreasing alcohol series,
and washed with PBS. For antigen retrieval, slides were placed in 0.1 mol/L
sodium citrate buffer (pH 6), microwaved to boiling point thrice, and cooled
to room temperature for 20 min. Sections were denatured with 4 N HCl
(20 min at 37jC) and washed with PBS (2 5 min), and nonspecific protein
binding was blocked by preincubation with casein solution (Power Block,
BioGenex) for 20 min. Sections were incubated with PC-10 primary
antibody (diluted 1:50 in Power Block) at 4jC for 16 h. Antigen-antiserum
complexes were visualized using the super sensitive alkaline phosphatase–
labeled, biotin streptavidin–amplified detection system and Fast Red as
chromogen according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BioGenex).
Cell proliferation was quantified on PCNA-stained sections and
randomized across all treatment and control groups. Twenty microscopic
fields (10 ocular, 40 objective) were randomly chosen in the outer cortex

www.aacrjournals.org

and inner cortex/outer medulla. All tubule cell nuclei were counted,
concurrently differentiating between negative and positive PCNA staining.
Nuclear labeling indices (LI %) for PCNA (PCNA-positive nuclei/total
number of nuclei counted) were determined based on a minimum of at
least 2,000 nuclei evaluated.
RNA isolation and expression profiling. RNA isolation from RNAlaterfixed kidneys was done as described previously (22). Starting with 5 Ag of
total RNA with a 28S/18S rRNA peak ratio >1.7, biotin-labeled cRNA was
prepared and subsequently hybridized on Affymetrix Rat Genome RAE230A
arrays according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix; GeneChip
Expression Analysis 701194 Rev.1). This specific array contains 15,866 probe
sets, corresponding to f5,399 annotated rat genes and 10,467 expressed
sequence tags.
Microarray data processing and statistical analysis. Microarray
quality control was done as described previously (22), and gene expression
data were submitted to the GEO repository (accession no. GSE5923).3
Expressionist Analyst software (Genedata AG) was used for statistical
analysis. Significantly deregulated genes per compound were selected based
on the factors treatment and time as both single and interaction effects in a
two-way ANOVA with P cutoff of 0.005, combined with a 1.7-fold deregulation
threshold for at least one time point. Significantly deregulated genes were
divided into gene groups with distinct expression profiles over the time
course using self-organizing map (SOM) analysis. SOM analysis also allowed
deselection of genes showing inconsistent expression between the controls
at different time points. Using the adjusted data sets, gene expression ratios
of individual genes were calculated by dividing the respective expression
values of single treated replicate samples by the mean expression value of
all corresponding time-matched control samples. Heat maps were used to
graphically display the relative expression data, after one-dimensional
clustering of the genes ( for the validation of microarray data, see
Supplementary Information).
Functional analysis of microarray data. For functional analysis, each
significantly deregulated gene was characterized according to the
biochemical role of its encoded protein, whenever sufficient information
from databases [e.g., NetAffx from Affymetrix (update from August 2006),
Swissprot, Proteome, and Pubmed] was available. The consequence of the
direction of deregulation was interpreted specifically with regard to possible
downstream pathophysiologic effects. This allowed distribution of the
deregulated genes into toxicologic categories (Supplementary Table S1) and
facilitated the comparison of specific pathophysiologic pathways involved
in the response of Eker and wild-type rats to AA and OTA treatment. In
addition, the pathophysiologic pathways were compared with major
pathways suspected to be involved in AA- and OTA-induced carcinogenesis
(Tables 1 and 2) and histopathologic changes observed.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of histopathologic and cell
proliferation changes were carried out using GraphPad Prism 4 Software.
Statistically significant differences in nuclear labeling indices (LI %) or total
number of lesions in treated and control animals were analyzed by an
unpaired (two tailed) t test. A statistically significant effect of the treatment
time response was tested with a two-way ANOVA.

Results
Cell Proliferation Data
AA treatment resulted in no overt change in cell proliferation
rate (Fig. 1A and B) in either strain, despite that occasional AA
groups seemed to have a significantly lower proliferation then the
corresponding controls. Conversely, OTA treatment increased the
proliferation rate on day 14 (Fig. 1C and D; Fig. 2A and B) 3.8- and
3.4-fold above control in Eker and wild-type rats, respectively.
Moreover, Eker rats seemed to be more sensitive to OTA as an
increased cell proliferation rate was already observed at day 7 of
treatment.

NOTE: For the major toxicologic categories, the associated genes are listed together with their Genbank accession number. The main biochemical
functions or pathways in which these genes are involved are indicated in column 4. For Eker and wild-type rats, the fold deregulation ratios of genes that
were significantly deregulated over all time points according to one-way ANOVA are shown in the last eight columns. Genes meeting the significance
criteria are indicated in bold.
Abbreviations: Ek, Eker; wt, wild-type.

Preneoplastic and Neoplastic Pathology
Although no preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions (23) were observed
in any of the wild-type rat controls, the Eker rat control groups
presented with atypical tubules (Fig. 2C), atypical hyperplasia (Fig.
2D), and an occasional adenoma (see Supplementary Table S2).
Neither AA nor OTA treatment induced an increase in preneoplastic
or neoplastic lesions in wild-type rats. Similarly, AA treatment of Eker
rats resulted in no-significant increase in atypical tubules or atypical
hyperplasia. However, two carcinomas were observed in the day 14
AA-treated Eker group and an adenoma in the day one group. In
contrast, OTA treatment of Eker rats resulted in a significant increase
of atypical tubules on day 14 (Fig. 1E). However, no significant increase
in atypical hyperplasia or neoplastic lesions was observed.

Nonneoplastic Pathology
Overall, only marginal, strain-independent renal pathologic changes
were observed (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). AA treatment of
Eker and wild-type rats seemed to induce a slightly higher
inflammatory response in the cortex, corroborating earlier reports
by Chen et al. (24). Similarly, OTA treatment of Eker and wild-type rats
led to the previously reported (25) increased prevalence and severity of
apoptosis, karyomegaly, cell shedding, and tubular regeneration,
primarily in the P3 portion of the proxima (Fig. 2E and F). In addition,
an increased cell proliferation response was observed.

Gene Expression Profiles
Oral treatment of Eker and wild-type rats with AA and OTA,
respectively, led to a significant deregulation of gene expression

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

already after 1 day of exposure. Compared with the respective timematched controls, the number of significantly deregulated genes
increased with the duration of exposure in both strains. At all time
points, compound-treated Eker rats consistently showed a higher
number of significantly deregulated genes compared with their
wild-type counterparts (Fig. 3).
Overall, AA treatment led to the significant deregulation of 111
nonredundant genes in Eker rats compared with 81 genes in wild-type
rats. However, the visualization of the expression profiles of the union
of the Eker- and wild type–selected genes revealed a qualitatively
comparable profile in AA-treated Eker and wild-type rats. In contrast,
treatment with OTA resulted in 375 significantly deregulated,
nonredundant genes in Eker rats compared with 141 genes in wildtype rats, with a strikingly different expression profile of at least half of
the genes (Fig. 3).

Functional Analysis of Significantly Deregulated
Genes
Many of the nonredundant genes deregulated by AA (Table 1) or
OTA (Table 2) treatment in Eker and wild-type rats, respectively,
could be associated with major pathophysiologic processes
involved in renal toxicity and regeneration (see Supplementary
Table S1).

Genes deregulated by AA
Metabolism and bioactivation. Treatment of Eker and wild-type
rats with AA led to a prominent up-regulation of genes encoding
phase I or phase II biotransformation enzymes or drug transporters
(Table 1). Most of the genes were either constantly up-regulated

NOTE: For the major pathophysiologic categories, the associated genes are listed together with their Genbank accession number. The main biochemical
functions or pathways in which these genes are involved are indicated in column 4. For Eker and wild-type rats, the fold deregulation ratios of genes that
were significantly deregulated over all time points according to one-way ANOVA are shown in the last eight columns. Genes meeting the significance
criteria are indicated in bold.

over the whole exposure time frame or increasingly up-regulated
with prolonged duration of exposure in both Eker and wild-type
rats. In addition to the genes significantly deregulated in both
strains, some genes met the significance criteria only in one or the
other strain. Yet, the direction of deregulation was mostly
comparable (e.g., GSTM2 or CES3, apparently specific for Eker or
wild-type rats, respectively).
DNA damage response. p53 is inducible by DNA damage and
oxidative stress. The up-regulation of several p53 pathway genes, as
observed in Eker and wild-type rats, was therefore summarized as
DNA damage response (including oxidative stress). Most genes
involved in this category showed a time-dependent increase with
the highest deregulation values after 14 days of treatment and met
the significance criteria in both strains.
Inhibited cell survival and proliferation. In conjunction with the
DNA damage response described above, down-regulation of
antiapoptotic genes and genes involved in DNA replication and
cell cycle progression as well as the up-regulation of proapoptotic

www.aacrjournals.org

genes were observed. These genes showed a comparable timedependent increase in expression as the genes representing the
DNA damage response (see above), with the highest deregulation
values after 14 days of treatment. In contrast to the DNA damage
response genes, many of these genes showed an apparently strainspecific deregulation, yet again with a qualitatively similar
expression pattern for most of them in both strains. An exception
to the latter observation were genes directly involved in the G2-M
transition of the cell cycle, which were specifically and consistently
down-regulated in wild-type rats.
Enhanced cell survival/cell proliferation. Only three genes
were assigned to this category. The Tsc1 tumor suppressor
gene, which is known to be associated with Tsc2 (8), was
significantly down-regulated in Eker but not wild-type rat. Enhanced cell survival and proliferation induced by AA was suggested by the observed up-regulation of a positive regulator of cell
proliferation (KEG1) and the down-regulation of a proapoptotic
gene (WWOX).

Genes deregulated by OTA
Biotransformation. OTA treatment down-regulated the expression of several phase I and phase II enzymes and drug transporter
genes in both strains (Table 2). Although this effect seemed
constant over time for some genes, most deregulated genes
showed an enhanced down-regulation with increasing exposure
time. Besides the down-regulation of numerous genes coding for
components of the biotransformation machinery, OTA treatment
resulted in an increased up-regulation of the phase I gene
CYP4A12 in both strains and a consistent up-regulation of phase I
ALDH6A1 in Eker rats.
DNA damage response (including oxidative stress). OTA
treatment led to significant up-regulation of p53 pathway genes
in both strains. However, the up-regulation of these genes differed
between the two strains. Eker rather than wild-type rats showed an
up-regulation of genes known to be involved in oxidative stress
responses as well as down-regulation of genes that code for
products with extracellular antioxidant activities. The latter genes
and the up-regulated KEAP1, which suppresses the transactivation
of antioxidant responsive elements, were categorized as ‘‘enhanced
oxidative stress.’’

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

Cellular stress. A general stress response, as indicated primarily
by the up-regulation of several components of the stress-inducible
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, was predominantly
detectable in Eker rats because the latter genes were not
significantly deregulated in wild-type rats.
Inhibited cell survival and proliferation. Predominantly OTAtreated Eker rats presented with an up-regulated expression of
tumor suppressor, negative cell proliferation control, and proapoptotic response genes. However, in both strains, an inhibited cell
survival response could be inferred from the up-regulation of a
proapoptotic gene and the down-regulation of an antiapoptotic
and a DNA replication gene.
Enhanced cell survival and proliferation. Numerous genes
coding for regulators of cell survival signaling pathways [e.g., the
insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-PI3K-PKB pathway], antiapoptosis, mitosis, growth, and proliferation (including proto-oncogenes)
were primarily up-regulated in Eker rats, whereas a tumor
suppressor gene and a gene coding for a signal cascade inhibitor
(OVCA2) was down-regulated. In comparison, the latter genes
were not or only marginally deregulated in the wild-type rats
treated with OTA.

Carcinogen-Specific Gene Expression Profiles in Rats

Cell cycle progression and mitosis. Up-regulation of genes, more
directly involved in the cell cycle progression, was categorized
separately as they seemed as an entity distinct from the category
‘‘enhanced cell survival and proliferation.’’ Remarkably, gene
deregulation that would further cell cycle progression was
exclusively observed in Eker rats.
Cell structure remodeling. Similar to the effects observed for
genes involved in enhanced cell survival and proliferation (see
above), genes coding for components and regulators of the
cytoskeleton altered cell-cell adhesion or communication, and
components of the Rac and Rho signaling were almost exclusively
up-regulated in Eker rats.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition/fibrosis. This category
includes regulators of cell proliferation, growth factor activation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix known to be associated in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and/or fibrosis and that could be associated with the progression
of renal and urothelial tumors. Such increased expression of
components of the transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) pathway
and of a hepatocyte growth factor activator-inhibitor gene in

conjunction with a down-regulated expression of extracellular
matrix protease genes were predominantly deregulated in Eker
rats.

Discussion
As expected for the short-term duration and dose regimen
employed (9, 10), neither AA nor OTA induced pronounced
nonneoplastic renal pathology in either strain of rats. Although
AA-treated rats presented with a slightly higher inflammatory
response than the corresponding controls, OTA-treated rats
responded with the typical pathologic changes (e.g., karyomegaly,
apoptosis, cell shedding, regenerative proliferation, and an
inflammatory response in the renal cortex), as reported earlier
(10, 25). However, the AA- and OTA-induced nonneoplastic
pathology was clearly distinct from one another, and this was also
reflected in the cell proliferation assessment (Fig. 1). Lack of overt
cell necrosis and subsequent cell shedding and regeneration in the
tubuli of AA-treated rats coincided with absence of increased cell
proliferation, showing that AA had neither a cytotoxic nor a
mitogenic effect on the kidneys of either strain of rats. In contrast,

OTA-induced tubular toxicity and possibly mitogenic activity were
reflected in the overt cell regeneration observed with the
histopathologic and immunohistologic assessments. Moreover,
the observed effects increased with the duration of treatment
and were comparable in extent of effect in both strains. Based on
above observations, the age of animals used, and the duration and
type of exposure, the expectation was confirmed that no increased
prevalence (number of animals affected) or number (per animal) of
preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions were to be encountered in the
wild-type control and AA-treated rats. Moreover, AA treatment of
the arguably more susceptible Eker rats did not increase the
prevalence or number of lesions, suggesting that the Tsc2 mutation
was not critical for AA-induced effects. The two carcinomas
observed on day 14 in AA-exposed Eker rats cannot be conclusively
associated with AA treatment, as adenomas were also observed in
the corresponding Eker rat control and AA treatment groups
already on day 1 (see Supplementary Table S2). As the number of
animals employed for this experiment limited statistical evaluation,
a progression of already present adenomas to carcinomas due to
AA treatment cannot be excluded.
Similar to AA, OTA treatment was not associated with an
increased prevalence or number of lesions in wild-type rats despite
the clearly enhanced cell proliferative response in the renal cortex.
The latter observation corroborates numerous earlier findings
(10, 25), suggesting that non-genotoxic compound-induced renal
carcinogenesis can only be observed after a prolonged compound
exposure period. In contrast to the situation in the wild type, Eker
rats presented with a significantly increased prevalence and
number of atypical tubules on day 14 of OTA treatment (Fig. 1E;
Supplementary Table S2). The latter finding suggests that the
increased cell proliferative stimulus (Fig. 1C) provided for an

enhanced manifestation of the predisposition for renal neoplasia
mediated by the Tsc2 mutation and thus a direct or indirect
interaction of OTA with Tsc2 (tuberin) pathway.
At the outset of this experiment, it was assumed that each
compound would induce a distinct gene expression profile, which
is reflected by the short-term pathology but also displays
characteristic genes representative for pathways involved in the
compound-specific type of renal carcinogenesis. Consequently, the
genotoxic AA was expected to induce a gene expression profile,
most likely involving genes of cell cycle arrest and DNA damage
repair but not cell proliferation and most likely would not involve
Tsc2. Indeed, the expression profiles of AA-treated Eker and wildtype rats (Fig. 3) were not distinctly different and were similar to
expression profiles obtained with AA in kidneys of Big Blue
transgenic F344 rats (24). Several phase I genes were deregulated by
AA treatment from the first day of exposure. The gene product of
one of the up-regulated phase I genes (NQOI) was previously shown
to be capable of reducing the nitro group of AAI leading to
metabolic activation. NQOI up-regulation could, therefore, be at
least partly responsible for DNA adduct formation (16). Although
DNA adduct formation could not be measured with the study
design employed, previously published reports support the
assumption that AA DNA adducts are formed (14). Indeed, upregulation of several p53 pathway genes, including p53 target genes
carrying a p53 consensus sequence in the promoter region, was
most prominent on days 7 and 14 of exposure, indicating a DNA
damage response upon bioactivation of AA. This interpretation is
further supported by the fact that several of the p53 target genes
(e.g., MDM2, p21, or CCNG1) have also been shown to be upregulated in rat liver after short-term exposure to different known
genotoxic compounds (22). DNA damage and activation of p53

pathway genes are expected to result in cell cycle arrest (Fig. 4A)
followed by damage repair or programmed cell death (26). AA
treatment led to the deregulation of several genes involved in
apoptosis, with a comparable time profile to the p53 pathway and
target genes. Although cell cycle components are predominantly
regulated on the protein level, down-regulation of genes crucial for
the G2-M transition (e.g., CDC2, Cyclin B, TOME1, and CKS2) and
down-regulation of genes required for mitotic spindle formation,
like TUBA1 or HMMR , suggest a G2 arrest. Deregulation of the
latter genes in wild-type rats only may be explained by 12-fold
lower PI3K mRNA expression compared with Eker rats (27).
Increasing evidence suggest that constitutive activation of the PI3K
pathway could lead to defects in DNA damage checkpoint control
(28). Consequently, AA-induced G2-M arrest would, therefore, not
be readily detectable in Eker rats, although they responded with
up-regulation of proapoptotic genes as well as down-regulation of
Ki-67, an observation also supported by the cell proliferation and
pathologic analysis (Fig. 1A and B).
In contrast to AA, the gene expression profiles of OTA-treated
Eker and wild-type rats were distinctly different (Fig. 3). However,
in both strains, up-regulation of CYP4A12 and down-regulation of
other phase I and II genes could provide for increased generation
of reactive oxygen species and enhanced oxidative DNA damage
(19, 20), which could lead to cellular damage and regenerative cell
proliferation. Indeed, enhanced proximal tubular damage and cell
regeneration/proliferation (Fig. 1C and D) was observed in both rat
strains, corroborating the above interpretation. OTA-induced
oxidative stress and ensuing DNA damage in combination with
enhanced cell proliferation could increase the likelihood of
neoplastic transformation (29). The presence of oxidative DNA
damage, as also suggested by earlier findings (30–32), is supported
by the up-regulation of the p53 pathway genes SUPT16H in both
strains, MDM2 and CHEK2 in Eker rats, and RBBP6 in wild-type

www.aacrjournals.org

rats as well as by the time-dependent down-regulation of HSP 40-3,
CN1, MSRA, and MGST1, responsible for the protection of cells
against oxidative stress. Indeed, recent findings showed that
overexpression of glia maturation growth factor h (GMFB) resulted
in reduced antioxidant enzyme activities, subsequent accumulation
of H2O2, and finally enhanced oxidative injury of renal proximal
tubular cells (33). The 5.9-fold up-regulation of GMFB in Eker rats,
shown here, and the known reduced 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase expression in Eker rats (34) may suggest that Eker rats are
more susceptible to oxidative stress than wild-type rats. This interpretation is supported by the observation that Eker rats responded
with increased cell proliferation already on day 7 (Fig. 1C) and
increased formation of atypical tubules (Fig. 1E). However, OTAinduced regenerative proliferation may not have been the sole
contributor to the propagation of preneoplastic lesions. Indeed,
OTA has previously been assumed to have mitogenic properties
(35, 36), a hypothesis supported by down-regulation of IGFBP-4, a
negative regulator of the (IGF)-PI3K-AKT mitogenic pathway, in
Eker and wild-type rats. Despite this, only Eker rats showed a
significant increase of preneoplastic lesions. The latter can be
explained with the renal gene expression profile of OTA-treated
Eker rats that contains deregulated genes characteristic of the
most pertinent hallmarks involved in cancer progression (37): (a)
the evasion of programmed cell death via up-regulation of
antiapoptotic genes (e.g., PDC4, PEA15, or MCL1); (b) insensitivity
to growth inhibitory signals via up-regulation of proto-oncogenes
(e.g., MERTK, SMOH, V-KIT, and TMP); (c) self-sufficiency in growth
signals [e.g., via an activated (IGF)-PI3K-AKT pathway (PIK3CB,
AKT1S1, AKT2, or SBF1)]; (d) limitless replication potential [e.g., via
an up-regulation of genes involved in DNA replication (TOP1),
chromatin remodeling (SMARCA4), or mitotic spindle formation
(MAPRE1, AJUBA, NEK9)]; (e) sustained angiogenesis via upregulation of VEGF, VEZF1, and ANGPTL2; and ( f ) tissue invasion

and metastasis via a broad set of deregulated genes involved in cell
structure remodeling (e.g., Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor
ARHGEF11 or IQGAP1, an effector for CDC42 and RAC1) and EMT
(TGFbR-II, SMADs, CD44, and TIMP3).
As shown, OTA treatment of Eker rats led to the expression of
genes that could be intricately involved in, or are the result of,
activated mTOR signaling (38). Thus, OTA treatment and the Tsc2
mutation may have acted in concert or separately on the (IGF)PI3K-AKT pathway, thus resulting in a co-joint activation of mTOR
signaling. Additional stimulation of the mTOR pathway could be
possible by OTA-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) activation (35). Tsc2 was shown to be a direct substrate of
ERK (39). As Eker rats exhibit only one functional allele of the Tsc2
gene, OTA-mediated ERK-dependent inactivation of Tsc2 could
lead to more drastic and therefore earlier detection of proliferative
effects and neoplastic transformation in Eker rats (Fig. 4B).
In summary, gene expression profile comparisons with histopathologic findings from AA- and OTA-treated Eker and wild-type rats
discussed here highlight that gene expression analysis subsequent to
short-term in vivo assays may have the potential to identify
deregulated genes involved in compound- and strain-specific
pathology. Moreover, deregulation of genes, for which a similar

direction of deregulation has been reported for various types of
cancers, suggests that pathways linked to tumorigenesis may be
deregulated already after short-term carcinogen exposure. Whether
these changes in gene expression are transient or can be causally
linked to a compound-specific tumorigenicity cannot be determined
without gene expression profile analysis of the respective preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in rats chronically treated with AA or
OTA. This analysis, as currently carried out in this laboratory using
laser-capture microdissection (40), will provide further information
as to the relevance of the pathways identified in short-term
experiments for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying
AA- and OTA-induced renal carcinogenesis.
