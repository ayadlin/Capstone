ABSTRACT
The PI3K pathway is frequently hyperactivated in primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (T-ALL) cells. Activation of the PI3K pathway has been suggested as one
mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL, and patients harboring mutations
in the PI3K negative regulator PTEN may be at increased risk of induction failure and
relapse. By gene expression microarray analysis of T-ALL cells treated with the PI3K
inhibitor AS605240, we identified Myc as a prominent downstream target of the PI3K
pathway. A significant association was found between the AS605240 gene expression
signature and that of glucocorticoid resistance and relapse in T-ALL. AS605240 showed
anti-leukemic activity and strong synergism with glucocorticoids both in vitro and in a
NOD/SCID xenograft model of T-ALL. In contrast, PI3K inhibition showed antagonism
with methotrexate and daunorubicin, drugs that preferentially target dividing cells.
This antagonistic interaction, however, could be circumvented by the use of correct
drug scheduling schemes. Our data indicate the potential benefits and difficulties for
the incorporation of PI3K inhibitors in T-ALL therapy.

domain-containing proteins, which initiate the assembly
of signaling complexes that results in the activation of a
plethora of downstream effector molecules, including
protein kinase B (Akt) [4] and the mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) [5]. The PI3K pathway
is central to the control of cell survival, energy metabolism,
cellular motility and cell cycle progression [6–7].
Constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway in
hematological malignancies has been shown to support
tumor cell proliferation, viability and drug resistance in vitro
[8–10]. Moreover, PI3K signaling pathway is frequently
hyperactivated in primary T-ALL cells, for instance due
to microenvironmental stimulation, interleukin-7 receptor
(IL7R) oncogenic mutations or phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN) inactivation [11–15]. Activation of the
PI3K effector mTOR in T-ALL has been suggested to

INTRODUCTION
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is
an aggressive hematologic cancer [1]. The prognosis
of children with T-ALL has improved with modern
treatment protocols, based on the use of aggressive multiagent therapies [2]. However, T-ALL patients displaying
chemotherapy resistance show very poor survival.
Accumulating evidence indicates that the PI3K pathway is
linked to resistance to therapy in several types of cancer [3].
Class I PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases
predominantly activated by protein tyrosine kinases in
response to cell surface receptors. PI3K phosphorylates
phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) generating
phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3
serves as an anchor for pleckstrin homology (PH)

resulting from PI3K inhibition in T-ALL cell lines
correlated with signatures of classical PI3K inhibitors
(wortmannin and LY-294002), and rapamycin (sirolimus;
Supplementary Figure 2). Rapamycin is an inhibitor of
mTORC1, a complex downstream of PI3K signaling [5].
Although other interpretations may be possible, genes
downregulated by AS605240 were here considered to be
under positive transcriptional control of PI3K, whereas
those upregulated by AS605240 were considered under
negative control of PI3K.
GSEA analysis showed that AS605240 treatment
downregulated several gene sets related to cellular
growth in both T-ALL cell lines and primary cells,
including energy metabolism (glucose transport and
metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate
metabolism, and TCA cycle), transcription (nucleotide
metabolism, RNA polymerase III transcription, tRNA
and miRNA biosynthesis) and biosynthesis of a plethora
of compounds and cellular structures (biosynthesis
of purines, pyrimidines, amino acids, glucose, fatty
acids and steroids, and biogenesis of lysosome vesicles
and mitochondria). Among the top tier of gene sets
transcriptionally downregulated by AS605240 in both cell
lines and primary cells, four different gene sets represented
targets of Myc (Figure 1a–1d; Supplementary Figure 3a-b)
[28–30]. A fifth gene set representing a Myc oncogenic
signature [31] was downregulated by AS605240 in cell
lines (Supplementary Figure 3b).
The transcription factor Myc is a master regulator
of cell growth and multiple biosynthetic and metabolic
pathways [32], and its expression correlates with leukemia
initiating activity in T-ALL [33]. Myc inhibition by
AS605240 appeared to be Notch1-independent, since
Notch1 direct targets [34] were not transcriptionally
modulated (Figure 1e–1f). On the other hand, a broader
gene set of Notch1-responsive genes, which includes several
Myc targets [35], was significantly downregulated in cell
lines treated with AS605240 (Supplementary Figure 3c).
Although MYC mRNA levels were not significantly altered
after 6 h of AS605240 treatment (data not shown), western
blotting analysis evidenced decreased Myc protein levels in
Jurkat and Molt-4 cells after PI3K inhibition (Figure 1g).
Quantitative PCR confirmed downregulation of Myc
targets ALOX5AP, BCAT1, PRDX4 and LDHA in primary
cells treated with AS605240 (Supplementary Figure 3d).
BCAT1 was found to induce cell proliferation, migration
and invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [36]. LDHA
and PRDX4 were described as overexpressed in high-risk
neuroblastomas independently of other markers [37–38].
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that the
top biological functions downregulated by AS605240
in both cell lines and primary cells were related to
cholesterol biosynthesis (Supplementary Figure 4).
Glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL has been associated
to the upregulation of genes linked to cellular respiration,
biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, proliferation

represent one mechanism of resistance to glucocorticoids, a
common feature of relapse [16–17]. Moreover, synergistic
effects of inhibitors of the PI3K-downstream mTOR
pathway in T-ALL cell lines have been described [18–19].
We and others have shown that T-ALL patients harboring
PTEN mutations may be at increased risk of induction
failure and relapse [13, 20]. Importantly, PTEN aberrations
were associated with poor outcome and relapse in T-ALL
[20–22], suggesting that the level of PI3K activation may
influence resistance to treatment.
In this study, T-ALL cells were treated with a PI3K
inhibitor to identify a transcriptional PI3K activity signature.
PI3K inhibition downregulated genes associated with cellular
growth and targets of Myc. Moreover, the comparison of the
PI3K signature with gene expression data of primary T-ALL
samples indicates that higher PI3K activity is associated
with glucocorticoid resistance and worse clinical outcome.
We opted to use the PI3K inhibitor AS605240 in light of its
favorable pharmacological and biochemical characteristics
[23–24]. This allowed us to test the long term inhibition
effects of PI3K in a NOD/SCID xenograft model of T-ALL.
Functional assays demonstrated that PI3K inhibition
sensitizes T-ALL cells to glucocorticoids, but antagonizes
methotrexate (MTX) and daunorubicin (DNR), unless correct
drug scheduling is used.

RESULTS
PI3K activity is associated with increased
chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis in
T-ALL
Most cell lines are maintained in culture for years
and accumulate several genetic lesions not characteristic
of primary disease [25]. On the other hand, ALL primary
cells do not divide in vitro [26], which may affect their
response to small molecules [27]. Hence, we decided to
obtain transcriptional signatures of PI3K activity from
both cell lines and primary cells, which would provide
complementary aspects of gene expression modulation
by PI3K. To do so, seven T-ALL cell lines [GSE50998]
and 15 diagnostic T-ALL patient samples [GSE51000]
were treated with the PI3K inhibitor AS605240 or
vehicle for 6 h, and subjected to global gene expression
analysis using whole-transcript Affymetrix expression
arrays. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed
that most samples responded similarly to PI3K inhibition,
irrespectively of PTEN and NOTCH1 mutational status
(Supplementary Figure 1). Using paired Limma analysis,
we obtained 211 genes downregulated and 78 genes
upregulated in T-ALL primary cells (adjusted p-value <
0.05, FC > 1.5; Supplementary Table 1) and 174 genes
downregulated and 395 genes upregulated in T-ALL cell
lines (adjusted p-value < 0.05, FC > 1.5; Supplementary
Table 2) in response to AS605240 treatment. As expected,

and Myc. Notably, genes responsible for cholesterol
biosynthesis were found highly upregulated in
prednisolone resistant T-ALL [39], and ALL cells were
shown to be particularly dependent on endogenously
synthesized cholesterol, which is essential for the synthesis
of cellular membranes of highly proliferative cells [40].
Because PI3K inhibition targeted genes involved in Myc
signaling, cellular growth, and cholesterol biosynthesis,
we hypothesized that the AS605240-derived signature
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

would be correlated with gene expression patterns of
glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Indeed, GSEA
analysis showed that genes associated with prednisolone
resistance [39] were downregulated due to PI3K inhibition
(Figure 1h), whereas those associated with prednisolone
sensitivity [39] were upregulated (Figure 1i).
The PI3K activity signatures were then compared
against expression microarray data of 43 primary T-ALL
samples obtained at diagnosis from patients treated under

the GBTLI ALL-99 [41] and GBTLI-2009 protocols at
Centro Infantil Boldrini [GSE50999] (for clinical and
biological data, refer to Supplementary Table 3). GSEA
analysis showed that patients that underwent relapse had
higher expression of genes under positive control of PI3K
(downregulated by AS605240) and lower expression
values of genes under negative control of the pathway
(upregulated by AS605240; Figure 2). Altogether, our gene
expression data suggest that higher PI3K activity may be
associated with increased glucocorticoids resistance and
poor prognosis, which is in accordance with previous data
showing that PTEN mutated patients may be at increased
risk of early treatment failure and relapse [13, 20].

cells derived from one patient sample and randomized
eleven days later to receive AS605240 (20mg/kg) or
vehicle, intraperitoneally twice a day, 5 days a week.
Mice treated with the PI3K inhibitor showed decreased
leukemic progression in comparison to control mice, as
evaluated by the percentage of human CD45+ cells in
peripheral blood at different time points (Figure 3f).

AS605240 synergizes with glucocorticoids both
in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model of
T-ALL
To further evaluate the clinical potential of PI3K
inhibition for T-ALL treatment, we measured the cytotoxic
effect of AS605240 in combination with commonly
used chemotherapeutic drugs (Table 1). We observed
a synergistic interaction between AS605240 and a
glucocorticoid (prednisolone) in 5 out of 6 cell lines tested
(Figure 4a). Notably, cell lines intrinsically more resistant
to prednisolone (CCRF-CEM, HPB-ALL and Molt4) showed weaker synergism between AS605240 and
prednisolone, characterized by higher Combination Index
(CI) values (Figure 4a–4b). According to the COSMIC
database, cell lines CCRF-CEM, Jurkat and Molt-4 show
glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) missense mutations.
P12-ICHIKAWA and TALL-1 don’t show alterations in
NR3C1. The mutations identified in CCRF-CEM and
Jurkat have been associated with functionally defective
glucocorticoid receptors [42–43]. In agreement with that,
these cell lines were more resistant to prednisolone than
the remaining cell lines analyzed. Jurkat cells showed
the highest calculated IC50 value of prednisolone. For
this cell line, we were unable to measure the CI between
prednisolone and AS605240.
Accordingly,

Next, we sought to characterize the effects of
AS605240 against T-ALL cells, with the goal of preclinically assessing the potential benefits of PI3K inhibition
in T-ALL. AS605240 inhibited p-Akt (Figure 3a–3b) and
PIP3 (Figure 3c) accumulation and promoted apoptosis in
both T-ALL cell lines and primary cells, with activation
of Caspase-3 (Figure 3d, Supplementary Figure 5). The
IC50 concentrations of AS605240 in a 96 h assay ranged
from 12 to 22 μM depending on the cell line tested (Figure
3b, Supplementary Figure 6). These values are within
the same range necessary to inhibit approximately 75%
of PIP3 accumulation in Jurkat cells (Figure 3b). The
lower survival plateau reached zero in all cell lines and
no correlation was found between IC50 concentrations
and PTEN mutational status (data not shown). Notably,
T-ALL primary cells were significantly more sensitive to
AS605240 than normal human thymocytes (Figure 3e).

treatment with either drug alone (Figure 4c). Noteworthy,
no difference was observed in weight loss of T-ALL
transplanted NOD/SCID mice treated with AS605240
versus dexamethasone (Supplementary Figure 7). In
conclusion, our data strongly suggest that PI3K inhibition
potentiates the activity of glucocorticoids against T-ALL
cells both in vitro and in vivo.

and thus it is cytotoxic during the S-phase of the cell cycle.
AS605240 treatment completely abrogated MTX-induced
S-phase arrest in vitro (Figure 5b). Part of this antagonistic
interaction may result from AS605240-induced G0/
G1 cell cycle arrest, which decreases the number of
S-phase MTX-susceptible cells (Table 2, Figure 5b).
BrdU incorporation assays also showed decreased rate
of nucleotide incorporation during S-phase in Jurkat,
Molt-4 and P12-ICHIKAWA cells after 24 h treatment
with AS605240 (Table 2, Figure 5c). The lower rate of
DNA duplication in AS605240-treated cells may induce
increased tolerance to lower nucleotide availability under
MTX treatment [45]. Altogether, these results indicate
that both AS605240-induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and
the lower rate of DNA replication may contribute to the
antagonistic interaction between AS605240 and MTX.
Based on these evidences, we explored alternative
administration schedules to find possible therapeutic
windows for AS605240 use in the context of modern
ALL treatment protocols, which include MTX and other
anticancer drugs that target dividing cells. When AS605240

PI3K inhibition requires scheduling when
combined with drugs that target dividing cells
AS605240 showed an antagonistic interaction
in vitro with both MTX (Table 1; Figure 5a) and
DNR (Table 1) in all cell lines tested. MTX is an
antimetabolite that allosterically inhibits dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR), which participates in the synthesis of
tetrahydrofolate, an essential molecule for the biosynthesis
of purines, thymidylate and several amino acids [44].
MTX acts specifically during DNA and RNA synthesis,

Combination Index values for all cell lines tested. For MTX,
a synergistic interaction was present in P12-ICHIKAWA
cells and additive interactions were present in 3 out of 7 cell

slight synergism were present in 2 out of 3 cell lines (Table

most synergistic interactions were observed for the cell lines

is of major importance when considering the introduction
of PI3K inhibitors in T-ALL treatment schemes with
chemotherapeutic drugs that require cell division.

roles of PI3Kα, γ and δ in T-ALL leukemogenesis [13, 50],
suggesting that multiple isoforms of PI3K might play a role
in T-ALL.
Although the concentrations of AS605240 needed
to inhibit the PI3K pathway and induce cell death
in vitro were in the micromolar range, the drug was more
selective to leukemic cells than to normal thymocytes.
More importantly, the PI3K inhibitor prevented primary
T-ALL progression in vivo and may be given to mice for
months without inducing generalized toxicity [23–24].
Although this indicates the feasibility of AS605240 use to
treat T-ALL patients, we observed that mice had mobility
difficulties and remained immobile for several minutes
after AS605240 administration (Supplementary Video).
This raises the possibility of undesirable neurological side
effects not previously reported.
This is the first time that gene products downstream
of PI3K have been identified in T-ALL. Interestingly,
we observed a prominent effect of PI3K inhibition on
the expression of Myc target genes. The PI3K/Akt/
mTORC1 pathway is known to positively regulate Myc
protein abundance. Previous work in T-ALL demonstrated
that Akt phosphorylates and deactivates Gsk3-beta,
preventing phosphorylation of Myc and its degradation
through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway [51]. mTORC1
phosphorylates S6K1 which in turn enhances translation
of Myc mRNA by modulating the phosphorylation
of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4B [52]. At the
transcriptional level, in T-ALL, Myc is under control of
Notch1 [53]. Our microarray data showed no regulation
of Notch1 direct targets in response to AS605240,
suggesting that the effect of this drug on Myc targets most
likely occurred by posttranscriptional inhibition of Myc.
Accordingly, Myc protein levels were downregulated in
response to AS605240.
Glucocorticoids play a role of great importance in
contemporary ALL treatment protocols. Early response
to glucocorticoids is an informative prognostic factor
in childhood ALL [54] and glucocorticoid resistance

DISCUSSION
Aberrant activation of PI3K signaling pathways
has been implicated in many types of cancer [46].
PTEN mutations and elevated Akt activity were found
to be associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors
[47–48] and T-ALL [13, 20]. In this study, we show data
indicative of higher PI3K pathway activity in patients who
underwent relapse.
Given that PI3Kγ is predominantly expressed in the
hematopoietic system [49], the use of a PI3Kγ specific
inhibitor could offer an innovative rationale-based
therapeutic strategy for T-ALL. AS605240 was previously
described as an isoform-selective ATP-competitive
inhibitor of PI3Kγ with 30-fold selectivity over PI3K δ
and β, and 7.5-fold selectivity over PI3Kα [23]. However,
we found that AS605240 did not have cytotoxic effects
against T-ALL cells at concentrations expected to inhibit
solely PI3Kγ (0.1–0.2 μM) [23], being cytotoxic only at
concentrations high enough to inhibit more than 70% of
p-Akt accumulation (Figure 3b), presumably disrupting
the activity of several PI3K isoforms. All PI3K p110
subunits are highly expressed in primary T-ALL cells

transcriptional networks underlying resistance to one
drug may actually sensitize cells to the other. Translation
was suggested as one critical pathway determining the
balance between glucocorticoid and MTX sensitivity in
T-ALL [63]. We now provide evidence that this disparate
prednisolone/MTX transcriptional profile may be under
PI3K pathway control.
In summary, our gene expression analysis indicated
that PI3K activity is associated with chemotherapy
resistance in T-ALL. Accordingly, PI3K inhibition
sensitized T-ALL cells to glucocorticoids both in vitro
and in vivo. Furthermore, our data indicate that correct
scheduling will be of upmost importance when combining
PI3K inhibitors with drugs targeting dividing cells, which
are mainstream in current protocols against T-ALL.

is a well-documented feature of relapse [17, 55].
Glucocorticoid resistance was previously associated
with a proliferative phenotype involving upregulation
of glycolysis, cholesterol biosynthesis, and activation
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Myc signaling pathways [39,
56]. Indeed, fast growing T-ALL cell lines are more
resistant to both prednisolone and dexamethasone [39].
Previous studies observed a synergistic interaction
between rapamycin and dexamethasone in T-ALL [16,
57]. Moreover, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 sensitized
MLL-rearranged ALL cells to prednisolone in vitro [58].
In the present study, we showed that PI3K inhibition
promotes downregulation of metabolic and biosynthesis
pathways towards a gene expression profile more typical
of glucocorticoid sensitive ALL cases. The PI3K inhibitor
AS605240 synergized with glucocorticoids in vitro and the
combined use of AS605240 and dexamethasone enhanced
survival of mice engrafted with T-ALL. We observed
no difference between PTEN mutated and wild-type
transplanted leukemias with respect to AS605240 effect,
which raises the question if T-ALL patients may benefit
from PI3K inhibition irrespectively of PTEN mutational
status. Notably, we observed that T-ALL cell lines
intrinsically more resistant to prednisolone (CCRF-CEM,
HPB-ALL and Molt-4) showed weaker synergism between
AS605240 and prednisolone (Figure 4a–4b). This suggests
that the PI3K pathway is not the only pathway underlying
glucocorticoid resistance, corroborating previous findings
[59]. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown
that RAS mutations limit the effectiveness of PI3K
inhibitors [60–61].
AS605240 showed an antagonistic interaction with
MTX and DNR when both drugs were administered
simultaneously to cell cultures. MTX kills growing
tumor cells by limiting their supply of dTTP and purine
nucleotides, which leads to DNA repair defects, DNA
strand breaks and apoptosis. MTX-induced DNA strand
break accumulation is minimal in growth-arrested tumor
cells [45]. The anthracycline DNR increases the levels
of topoisomerase II:DNA covalently bound complexes,
generating DNA double strand breaks and inducing
apoptosis. Anthracyclines appear to be particularly toxic
during S-phase, when replication forks and transcription
complexes are both present [62]. Our results showed that
PI3K inhibition in leukemia cell lines not only induces cell
cycle arrest at G0/G1, but also decreases DNA synthesis
rate during cell division. This cytostatic effect is probably
responsible for the tolerance exhibited by AS605240treated cells to MTX and DNR. Our data also showed that
the antagonistic interaction with MTX and DNR could
be successfully circumvented by means of proper drug
scheduling in more than half of the cell lines studied in
vitro (Figure 5).
Recent evidence shows that genes most significantly
correlated with ALL resistance to prednisolone are
inversely correlated with MTX resistance, and that the

METHODS
Ethics Statement. Investigation has been conducted
in accordance with the ethical standards and according
to the Declaration of Helsinki and according to national
and international guidelines. The use of patient samples
was approved by the FCM/UNICAMP Research Ethics
Committee (CAAE: 0014.0.144.146–08) and informed
consent was obtained from parents. The use of the
xenograft animal model was approved by the CEEA/
UNICAMP Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee
(Protocol 1766–1).
Synthesis of AS605240. The water-soluble
potassium salt of AS605240 was synthesized according
to patent WO 2004007491. Identity and purity were
confirmed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic
resonance.
Primary T-ALL cells. Bone marrow mononuclear
cells were obtained from patients with newly diagnosed
T-ALL accrued from 2000 to 2013 at Centro Infantil
Boldrini, Campinas, Brazil. Treatment was performed
according to the Brazilian GBTLI ALL-99 [41] and
GBTLI ALL-2009 protocols. NOTCH1, PTEN and IL7R
were sequenced as described elsewhere [12, 20, 64].
Cell lines culture and survival assays. Cell
lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C
and 5% CO2. Medium was changed 12–24 h before all
experiments. To measure IC50 values, cells (2–6 × 104)
were incubated for 96 h with increasing concentrations
of AS605240, prednisolone, L-asparaginase, MTX
or DNR. To measure Combination Index (CI) values
between AS605240 and the other drugs, 2-fold ratios of
the calculated IC50 values (0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x or 4x) of
each drug were used either in combination or as single
drugs. Cells were treated for a total of 96 h. When drug
scheduling was applied, one of the drugs was added
48 h after the start of the experiment. Cell viability
was measured by the MTT assay. IC50 and CI values
were calculated with the GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad
13113

Oncotarget

Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and Calcusyn (Biosoft,
Cambridge, UK) [65] softwares, respectively. Calculated
IC50 values are shown in Supplementary Table 4.
PI3K gene expression signatures. Cell lines (5–
10 × 107) were cultured with the AS605240 IC50 value
or vehicle for 6 h, RNA was extracted by the phenolchloroform method and purified with the RNAeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). Samples were
processed with the One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control
Reagents Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and
hybridized on HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix).
Cryopreserved primary T-ALL cells were thawed, washed
in RPMI-1640 twice and viable cells were isolated with
the Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany). Approximately 3 × 106 cells were cultured with
20 μM of AS605240 or vehicle for 6 h in AIM-V medium
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 2
mM glutamine, 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin at
37°C and 5% CO2. RNA was extracted with the Illustra
RNAspin Mini RNA Isolation Kit (GE Healthcare,
Little Chalfont, UK), processed with the GeneChip WT
cDNA Synthesis and Amplification Kit (Affymetrix) and
hybridized on Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix).
Expression values were obtained with the iterPLIER+16
algorithm and expressed in a log2 scale. Paired Limma
analysis (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.12/
bioc/html/limma.html) was used to obtain differentially
expressed genes with FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05
and Fold-change > 1.5. Cells of each patient or cell
line treated with AS605240 or vehicle were assigned
as counterparts for the paired analysis. GSEA analysis
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/) [66] was performed
with 1000 phenotype permutations and default settings.
Only probesets/transcript clusters annotated with a Gene
Symbol were used in the analysis. For Connectivity Map
analysis (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/) [67], only
probesets identical in HG-U133A and HG-U133 Plus 2.0
arrays were used. Gene sets were considered significantly
regulated when p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.25. Ingenuity
Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City,
CA, USA) was performed with the Gene Symbols of
AS605240 responsive genes. Principal Component
Analysis was performed with the MultiExperiment Viewer
(http://www.tm4.org/mev.html).
Gene expression of diagnostic T-ALL. Total RNA
was extracted from T-ALL lysates preserved in guanidine
isothiocyanate solution using the Illustra RNAspin Mini
RNA Isolation Kit (GE Healthcare). RNA samples were
processed with the WT Expression Kit (Ambion, Austin,
TX, USA) and GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling and
Controls Kit (Affymetrix), and hybridized on Human
Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. Expression values were obtained
with the iterPLIER+16 algorithm and expressed in a log2
scale. GSEA analysis was performed with 1000 gene set
permutations. All array files used in this study are publicly

biological data, refer to Supplementary Table 3.
Quantitative PCR. RNA samples of T-ALL
primary cells treated with AS605240 or vehicle in
vitro were submitted to cDNA synthesis with the
ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega,
Madison, USA) and quantitative PCR with HOT
FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Mix Plus (Solis BioDyne,
Tartu, Estonia) in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). Expression was

Cell signaling assays. PIP3 quantification of
Jurkat cells (3 × 107) treated for 8 h with AS605240 IC50
value or vehicle was performed in duplicates using the
K-2500 PIP3 Mass ELISA Kit (Echelon Biosciences,
Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Phospho-Akt quantification of
Jurkat and Molt-4 cells treated for 24 h with increasing
concentrations of AS605240 or vehicle was performed
using the Akt [pS473] ELISA Kit (Invitrogen). Western
blotting analysis of Jurkat cells treated with AS605240
IC50 values or vehicle was performed using antibodies
against Akt (#4691, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA, USA), p-Akt (#4060, Cell Signaling Technology),
Myc (N-262, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) and β-actin (IM-0075, Rhea Biotech, Campinas,
Brazil).
Apoptosis analysis. Jurkat cells (1 × 106) treated
for 8 h with AS605240 IC50 value or vehicle and primary
T-ALL cells (1.5 × 106) treated for 6 h with 20 μM of
AS605240 or vehicle were analyzed for apoptosis. Cells
were either stained with PE Rabbit Anti-Active Caspase-3
(Becton Dickinson) according to manufacturer's
instructions, or incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes with
FITC-conjugated Annexin-V (Invitrogen Corporation)
and PI 5 μg/mL in Annexin-V binding buffer. Cells were
analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer.
Cell cycle and Brdu incorporation assays. For
cell cycle analysis, Molt-4 cells (2 × 105) were treated
with the IC50 values of AS605240, MTX and/or vehicle
for 24 h. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed with
PBS and incubated at 37°C for 15 min in 1 mL PI Buffer
(0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/mL RNAse, and 20 μg/
mL PI, in PBS). Ten thousand events were collected in
a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and data was analyzed
with the ModFit LT 3.3 software (Verity Software House,
Topsham, ME, USA). For Brdu incorporation assays,
13114

Oncotarget

Molt-4, P12-ICHIKAWA and Jurkat cells (1 × 106) were
treated for 24 h with AS605240 IC50 values or vehicle,
pulsed for 30 min with 10 μM BrdU and processed with
the BrdU Flow Citometry Assay Kit (Becton Dickinson).
Events (2 × 104) were analyzed in a FACSCanto flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
In vivo experiments. Primary T-ALL cells were
thawed, washed with PBS and 1 × 107 cells were injected
in NOD/SCID (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J) mice (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) via the tail
vein. After 10–12 weeks, successfully engrafted mice
were sacrificed, T-ALL cells were collected from spleen
and liver and 1 × 107 cells were immediately injected in
higher number of non-irradiated mice for the following
experiments. For disease progression experiments, mice
received 20 mg/Kg of AS605240 (n = 5) or vehicle
(n = 12), intraperitoneally twice a day, 5 days a week,
starting on the eleventh day after injection of leukemia cells.
Number of human CD45+ cells in the peripheral blood
after red blood cells lysis was regularly measured by flow
cytometry and exponential growth curves were compared
with the F test of the best-fit K values. For survival
analysis experiments, mice were randomly distributed
into the different treatment groups (5 animals per group)
when human CD45+ reached ≥ 0.5% of peripheral blood
cells in half of the animals. Mice were treated with
30 mg/Kg of AS605240 and/or 5 mg/Kg of dexamethasone,
intraperitoneally once a day, 5 days a week, for 35 days.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the
log-rank test with the GraphPad Prism 5 software.
