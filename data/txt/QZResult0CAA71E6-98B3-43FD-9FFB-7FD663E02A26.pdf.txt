ABSTRACT
Background: Gastrointestinal cancers are characterized by a male predominance,
suggesting a role of sex hormones. We hypothesized that digitalis medication, due to its
estrogenic properties, decreases the risk of male-predominated gastrointestinal cancers.
Results: Long -term digitalis use (≥2 years) was followed by decreased risk for
several gastrointestinal cancers, but associations were statistically significant only for
liver cancer (hazard ratio [HR]=0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.98). Shortterm (<1 year) use was associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (HR=1.79, 95% CI 1.01-3.17), colorectal cancer (HR=1.72, 95% CI
1.57-1.89), gallbladder cancer (HR=1.93, 95% CI 1.04-3.59), and pancreatic cancer
(HR=1.33, 95% CI 1.00-1.76), but no such increase was found among long-term users.
Methods: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study in Sweden.
Participants included 156,385 individuals using digitalis and a reference group of
551,933 users of organic nitrates between 2005 and 2013, who were identified in
the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. New diagnoses of gastrointestinal cancers
were identified from the Swedish Cancer Register. Hazard ratios of gastrointestinal
cancers in digitalis users compared to users of organic nitrates were calculated from
Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for sex, age, municipality of
residence and comorbidity.
Conclusions: This study suggests a decreased risk of male-predominated
gastrointestinal cancers, particularly of liver cancer, in long-term users of digitalis.
Short-term use may be associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gallbladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer.The use
of digitalis as preventive or therapeutic agents remains to be fully evaluated.

a protective role of estrogenic exposures, have been
hypothesized to be involved in the development of some
male-predominated gastrointestinal cancers, but the
existing evidence is inconclusive [1, 4–6].
Digoxin and other digitalis medications are widely
used in treating common cardiovascular diseases, i.e.
heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Interestingly, digitalis
resembles estrogen chemically and can bind to estrogen
receptors and exert estrogenic properties [7]. Recent

INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal cancers account for approximately
30% of all cancers worldwide. Most of them are
characterized by a remarkable male predominance
in incidence [1, 2]. Esophageal adenocarcinoma has
the highest male to female incidence ratio (up to 9:1),
which is not fully explained by known risk factors [1,
3]. Sex hormones and reproductive factors, particularly

pharmaco-toxicological studies suggest an anti-cancer
potential of digoxin in vitro, and anti-cancer effects are
being investigated in early-phase clinical cancer trials
[8–11]. If sex hormones play a role in the etiology of
gastrointestinal cancers, digitalis use may influence the
risk of these cancers. However, this hypothesis has rarely
been tested.
We hypothesized that digitalis use is associated with
a reduced risk of gastrointestinal cancers, and that the
magnitude of the association varies across anatomical sites
and histological types of these malignancies, depending on
the level of hormone-dependence. To test this hypothesis,
we examined the association between digitalis use and the
risk of gastrointestinal cancers in a nationwide populationbased cohort study in Sweden.

of organic nitrates included 551,900 individuals (and
2,653,833 person-years). Some characteristics of the
study participants using digitalis and organic nitrates only
are presented in Table 1. There were fewer male digitalis
users (46%) than male users of organic nitrates (53%). The
mean age at first known exposure was 77.5 years in users
of digitalis and 70.7 years in users of organic nitrates.

Risk of gastrointestinal cancer
Both digitalis users and users of organic nitrates
had elevated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for most
gastrointestinal cancers when compared to the general
population (Table 2). When comparing digitalis users
with users of organic nitrates, the IRRs were significantly
increased for esophageal cancer (IRR=1.22, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.46), colorectal cancer (IRR
1.23, 95% CI 1.17-1.29) and gallbladder cancer (IRR 1.63,
95% CI 1.19-2.25), but were closer to unity for most of the
other cancers studied (Table 2).
The hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox regression in
all digitalis users (Table 3) were similar to the IRRs
from Poisson regression (Table 2). Digitalis use was
associated with an increased HR for esophageal cancer
(adjusted HR=1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.51), colorectal
cancer (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.18-1.30), and gallbladder

DISCUSSION

duration of digitalis exposure in incident users indicated
reduced HRs for several types of gastrointestinal
cancers in participants who had used digitalis for at
least 2 years, but was statistically significant only
for liver cancer (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.16-0.98). Shortterm use (<1 year) of digitalis was associated with an
increased HR for esophageal cancer (HR=1.46, 95% CI
1.01-2.11), colorectal cancer (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.571.89), gallbladder cancer (HR=1.93, 95% CI 1.04-3.59)
and pancreatic cancer (HR=1.33, 95% CI 1.00-1.76)
(Table 3).
In analyses by histological type, an increased risk
of esophageal cancer in digitalis users was found for
squamous cell carcinoma (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22-2.13),
but only restricted in short-term users when analyzed
by duration of exposure (HR=1.79, 95% CI 1.01-3.17)
(Table 4). Digitalis use was associated with a reduced but
statistically insignificant HR for hepatocellular carcinoma
regardless of the duration of exposure, and there was
seemingly a trend toward lower HRs with longer duration
of exposure. Use of digitalis for 2 years or more was
associated with a possibly reduced HRs for esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma and
cholangiocarcinoma, but without statistical significance
(Table 4).
The inclusion of a restriction period of 6 months
or 1 year did not substantially alter the associations
between the duration of exposure to digitalis and the risk
of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer,
colorectal cancer, or gallbladder cancer (Figure 1).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

This study found some support for the hypothesis
that digitalis use for at least 2 years is associated with a
decreased risk of several types of gastrointestinal cancer,
although the results were statistically significant only for
liver cancer. Shorter term use (<2 years) of digitalis was
rather associated with an increased risk of esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gallbladder
cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
Strengths of this study include the large sample size,
population-based cohort design, valid data on exposures
and outcomes, complete follow-up of all participants and
the evaluation of confounding by adjustment for potential
confounders, including demographic characteristics and
comorbidities, and by using a reference cohort exposure
to organic nitrates. The use of a reference cohort and the
sensitivity analyses with restriction periods reduced the
risk of detection bias arising from more medical attention
being given to patients with cardiovascular diseases.
Despite the large sample size, a major limitation of the
study is the low statistical power to assess long-term use
of digitalis, which is likely the most important exposure
from a cancer etiology perspective. Despite strongly
reduced point estimates, most failed to reach the level of
statistical significance. We were unable to assess the sexspecific effects of digitalis use due to the limited number
of cancer patients, particularly the small number of
female patients. Moreover, considering the large number
of comparisons made in this report, the possibility of

false discoveries by chance due to multiple testing could
not be ruled out. Another limitation is that we were not
able to adjust for all potential confounders, introducing
a risk of residual confounding from unmeasured risk
factors of gastrointestinal cancers. There were more
patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
diabetes in digitalis users compared with users of nitrates
(Supplementary Table 1), indicating possible confounding
from risk factors shared by gastrointestinal cancers and
these conditions, e.g., tobacco smoking and dietary factors.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Such possible residual confounding, although partially
controlled for, might have contributed to the observed
increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer in digitalis users
and diluted expected inverse associations between digitalis
exposure and the risk of other gastrointestinal cancers. A
further weakness is that information on digitalis use was
not available until the start of the study date (July 1, 2005),
which introduced a risk of exposure misclassification. Any
such misclassification is likely to be non-differential and

should thus have attenuated the observed associations
rather than explained them. Finally, this study was based
on a relatively older Swedish population, and thus, our
findings may not be representative of other populations
or ethnicities.
Recent studies have revealed an increased risk of
cancers of the breast and uterus, and a decreased risk of
prostate cancer following digitalis use [12–17]. Our study
is the first to investigate digitalis use in relation to the risk
of gastrointestinal cancers other than colorectal cancer.
A case-control study from the United Kingdom found an
increased risk of colorectal cancer among users of digitalis
compared with non-users [18], a finding supported by
our study. These findings contradict the hypothesis of a
protective effect as suggested by previous epidemiological
findings of an inverse association between estrogens and
colorectal cancer risk in postmenopausal women [6, 19,
20], although increased risk of colorectal cancer associated
with estrogenic exposures has been reported in some other
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies [21, 22]. The possibly increased risk of esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gallbladder
cancer and pancreatic cancer among digitalis users in the
present study needs confirmation in other studies. Residual
confounding by e.g. tobacco smoking cannot be excluded,
particularly since no association was found among longterm users of digitalis.
The possibly decreased risk of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric
cancer, and liver cancer in long-term users of digitalis
is interesting and supports the estrogen hypothesis of
the study. An anti-cancer potential of digitalis has been
found in pharmaco-toxicological studies in vitro [8, 10,
11]. The possible biological mechanisms include, but are
not limited to, inhibition of proliferation in cancer cells,
controlling of the cell cycle, induction of apoptosis, and
anti-inflammatory properties [8, 10, 11, 23]. Digitalis
is a phytoestrogen that binds to the estrogen receptors
through a lower affinity than for estrogen itself [7, 24].

The decreased risk associated with long-term exposure
to digitalis for gastrointestinal cancers, particularly
liver cancer, may be explained by a protective role of
estrogenic exposures. This might contribute to the male
predominance in some of these tumors. On the contrary,
the increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
colorectal cancer, gallbladder cancer, and pancreatic
cancer may be related to non-estrogenic or pathways
other than the aforementioned mechanisms, which
merits further investigation. There is no strong reason
to believe that estrogens are involved in the etiology of
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer,
gallbladder cancer, or pancreatic cancer, which have
a weak-to-moderate male predominance explained by
other risk factors or even a female predominance. It is
well-established that the principal pharmacological effect
of digitalis is mediated through the inhibition of Na+/K+
ATPase, leading to alterations of downstream transduction

pathways [10, 11]. Particularly, alterations of intracellular
calcium homeostasis following the inhibition of Na+/K+
ATPase may influence the regulation of proliferation,
apoptosis, autophagy, and tumor differentiation, which
may lead to an altered cancer risk [25, 26]. Given the
complexity of the enzyme structure and the fact that its
exact function and regulation in normal cells and cancer
cells are largely unclear [10], the role of digitalis in cancer
development and whether it is dependent on specific
cellular contexts in given cancer tissues need to be further
explored. Although assessment of the anti-cancer activity
of digitalis has already reached early-phase clinical trials
[10, 11], the use of digitalis as preventive or therapeutic
agents remains to be fully evaluated.
In summary, this large population-based cohort
study suggests that long-term use of digitalis is followed
by a decreased risk of liver cancer, and possibly also
of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal

adenocarcinoma, and gastric cancer. Short-term use of
digitalis may increase the risk of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gallbladder cancer, and
pancreatic cancer. However, the statistical power was
limited by the rarity of these cancers, and these findings
remain to be confirmed in other large-scale investigations
with longer follow-up.

on comorbidities was obtained through linkage to the
Swedish Patient Register. We restricted the comorbidities
to diagnoses within 20 years before the end of followup and after 1 January 1987, from which the Patient
Register achieved complete nationwide coverage [29].
Candidate comorbidities included known risk conditions
for specific gastrointestinal cancers (e.g., gastroesophageal
reflux disease for esophageal adenocarcinoma), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease or
liver cirrhosis, and diabetes (Supplementary Table 1). The
latter three groups of comorbidities were used as indirect
indicators for tobacco smoking, heavy alcohol use, and
both, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design
The source population consisted of all residents in
Sweden from July 1, 2005 (when the Swedish Prescribed
Drug Register started) to December 31, 2013 [27]. The
cohort of digitalis users consisted of all individuals who
had been dispensed any digitalis with the Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code “C01AA”
according to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. To
counteract possible information bias and confounding
related to cardiovascular diseases and risk factors for
such diseases, we compared the exposed cohort to a
reference cohort of individuals who had been exposed
to the angina pectoris drugs organic nitrates (ATC code
C01DA), but had no digitalis medication. The 10-digit
unique personal identity number assigned to all Swedish
residents allowed us to obtain additional information
through linkage of study participants to other nationwide
registers. We used the Swedish Cancer Register to exclude
individuals with any diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancers
(codes according to the International Classification of
Diseases, version 7 [ICD-7]: 150-157) before their first
known exposure to digitalis or organic nitrates. Cohort
members were followed up until the occurrence of any
new gastrointestinal cancer, death (through linkage to the
Swedish Causes of Death Register), or December 31, 2013
(end of the study), whichever occurred first. This study
was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in
Stockholm, Sweden (Protocol Number: 2015/3: 8).

Statistical analysis
To facilitate the possible comparison with other
studies where when only tabulated data are available
instead of individual records, we calculated the IRRs of
gastrointestinal cancers separately for individuals exposed
to digitalis and those exposed to organic nitrates. The
IRRs were calculated by dividing the observed incidence
rates by the baseline incidence rates in the corresponding
population. We also computed the IRRs of these cancers
by directly comparing digitalis users with users of organic
nitrates. All IRRs and their 95% CIs were estimated by
log-linear Poisson regression with adjustment for age (in
5-year groups), sex, and calendar year, where the count of
cancer cases was the dependent variable with the natural
logarithm of person-time as the offset term [30].
We also performed Cox proportion hazards
regressions to estimate the HRs for gastrointestinal cancers
in digitalis users compared to users of organic nitrates
while adjusting for sex, age at first known exposure (<50
years, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥ 80 years), municipality
of residence, and cancer type-specific comorbidities.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was used as an
indirect marker for tobacco smoking and other respirable
environmental exposures, chronic liver disease or liver
cirrhosis as for heavy alcohol use, and diabetes as for
both. Considerations of other comorbidities to be included
in each adjustment were based on of their association
with the specific type of cancer. We further performed
analyses stratified by histological type, i.e., separately
for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ICD-7 codes:
150; histological codes using ICD for Oncology, version
3 [ICD-O-3]: 8050-8078, 8083-8084), adenocarcinoma of
esophagus and gastric cardia (ICD-7 codes: 150, 151.1;
histological codes: 8140-8141, 8143-8145, 8190-8231,
8260- 8263, 8310, 8401, 8480-8490, 8550-8551, 85708574, 8576), hepatocellular carcinoma (ICD-7 code: 155.0;
histological code: 8170-8176), and cholangiocarcinoma
(ICD-7 code: 155.0; histological codes: 8050, 5140-8141,
8160-8161, 8260, 8440, 8480-8500, 8570-8572; or ICD-7
codes: 155.1-155.9; histological codes: 8010, 8020, 8041,
8070, 8140, 8160, 8161, 8260, 8310, 8480, 8490, 8560,

Exposures, outcomes and covariates
We extracted all records of digitalis and organic
nitrates prescriptions dispensed during the study period
from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Obtained
information included dates of prescription and dispensing,
the dosage, and the amount of the prescribed drugs
in terms of the numbers of DDDs per package and the
number of dispensed packages.
New diagnoses of gastrointestinal cancers were
identified through linkage to the Swedish Cancer Register,
which has at least 96% coverage of all malignancies
in the whole nation and 99% of reported cases were
morphologically verified [28]. Potential confounding
factors included in the analyses were age, sex,
municipality of residence, and comorbidity. Information

8162-8163), given the known etiological heterogeneity
in cancers of different histological type even in the same
anatomical sites.
Since the dosage of digitalis was almost always
standard with a narrow range within Sweden, we
evaluated only potential dose-response associations in
terms of duration. Because a prescription is valid only for
up to 12 months in Sweden, we defined individuals with
their first prescription in the first 12 months of the study
as “prevalent users”, for whom information on exposure
prior to the study was unclear. The remaining individuals
were defined as “incident users”. The duration of exposure
in incident users was estimated by the DDDs dispensed
divided by 365.25 (days per year), and then categorized
into three groups: <1 year, 1-2 years, and ≥2 years of
duration. To assess potential detection bias from medical
attention related to digitalis use, which might have led to
an earlier diagnosis of cancer, we performed sensitivity
analyses ignoring exposure within a restriction period
of 6 months or 1 year before the cancer diagnosis was
identified. All statistical analyses were performed using
the statistical package SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA). A p value less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
