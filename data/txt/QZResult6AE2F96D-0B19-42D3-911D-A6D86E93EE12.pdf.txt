Abstract
Autophagy that is induced by starvation or cellular stress can enable cancer cell survival by sustaining energy
homeostasis and eliminating damaged organelles and proteins. In response to stress, cancer cells have been
reported to accumulate the protein p62/SQSTM1 (p62), but its role in the regulation of autophagy is controversial. Here, we report that the plant phytoalexin resveratrol (RSV) triggers autophagy in imatinib-sensitive and
imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells via JNK-dependent accumulation of p62. JNK inhibition or p62 knockdown prevented RSV-mediated autophagy and antileukemic effects. RSV also stimulated
AMPK, thereby inhibiting the mTOR pathway. AMPK knockdown or mTOR overexpression impaired RSVinduced autophagy but not JNK activation. Lastly, p62 expression and autophagy in CD34+ progenitors from
patients with CML was induced by RSV, and disrupting autophagy protected CD34+ CML cells from RSVmediated cell death. We concluded that RSV triggered autophagic cell death in CML cells via both JNK-mediated
p62 overexpression and AMPK activation. Our findings show that the JNK and AMPK pathways can cooperate to
eliminate CML cells via autophagy. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1042–52. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative syndrome linked to a hematopoietic stem cell disorder
leading to the increased production of granulocytes at all
stages of differentiation (1). Patients with CML carry the
t(9;22) (q34;q11) translocation (2). This translocation is responsible for the expression of a 210 kDa chimeric fusion
protein, p210 BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase
(3). The role of BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of CML is linked
to the activation of several downstream survival pathways including signal transducer and activator of transcription5/B
cell lymphoma/leukemia x, Ras/Raf, MAP kinase-ERK
kinase/Erk-1/2, Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase/Akt, and nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which collectively provide proliferative
advantages and resistance to apoptosis (4–6).

vention of cardiovascular diseases (7), and is currently being
used in phase I studies to treat obese and diabetic patients.
In addition, RSV has also been shown to exhibit potent anticancer properties in some epithelial tumors and leukemia
(8, 9). For instance, RSV has been reported to either protect
CML cell lines from stress-induced apoptosis mainly through
its antioxidant properties (10), or conversely, to induce cell
death when used alone (11). However, the molecular mechanisms by which RSV exerts its antileukemic effects in
CML cell lines remains incompletely understood (12). We
have previously reported that RSV induces apoptosis in
CML cell lines. More interestingly, we have shown that RSV
also triggered cell death in imatinib-resistant (IM-R) cell lines
and in Baf/3 cells carrying several mutated forms of BCRABL commonly found in resistant patients (13). However,
the effects of RSV in CML cells are only partly inhibited by
caspase inhibitors, strongly suggesting that RSV also exerts
its potent antileukemic effect through caspase-independent
cell death.
Autophagy is a catabolic process for the degradation and
recycling of macromolecules and organelles, which is activated during stress conditions (12). Autophagy is initiated by the
formation of double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes to form autophagolysosomes in which lysosomal hydrolases digest the vesicle
contents for recycling (12, 14). The formation of autophagosomes is a three-step process characterized by nucleation,
elongation, and completion of an isolation membrane or
phagophore. The phagophore recruits different Atg proteins
and its nucleation depends on PI3KCIII/Vps34 activity. Atg
proteins, including Atg12, Atg5, and Atg16L are involved in
the elongation of the isolation membrane, whereas LC3-II

RSV Mediates Autophagy in CML Cells via JNK and AMPK

and P62 act as structural components of the autophagosomes (15). Autophagy is induced by various stimuli such
as metabolic stress, energy need, and chemotherapy for instance (12, 16). Autophagy is considered as a survival mechanism induced in adverse conditions to maintain cell
integrity, but paradoxically, it is also involved in a particular
mode of death called autophagic cell death or type II cell
death (12, 17, 18).
There is compelling evidence in the literature that RSV is
capable of inducing autophagy in different cancer cell line
models (19–23) but nothing is known regarding its effect
on autophagy induction in leukemia. Moreover, the signaling
pathways by which RSV mediates autophagy induction and
exerts its antileukemic effects are far from being completely
elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to decipher the mechanism of action of RSV in CML cells and to
investigate whether autophagy contributes to the potent antileukemic effect of this compound. Here, we describe that
RSV triggers autophagy in CML cell lines and CD34+ primary
cells from CML patients through both AMPK-dependent production of phagophores and p62-dependent elongation and
accumulation of autophagosomes. Therefore, the remarkable
efficiency of RSV in IM-R cell lines is likely due to its capacity
to trigger both apoptotic and autophagic cell death.

Results
RSV induces autophagy in imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells. We previously reported that treatment of imatinib-sensitive (IM-S) or IM-R K562 cells with RSV for 24 to
48 hours resulted in loss of cell viability and induction of apoptosis (13). However, the effect of RSV was only partly inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, suggesting
that other modes of cell death were also induced (13). Accordingly, electronic microscopy images of IM-S and IM-R
cells treated for 48 hours with RSV showed typical images
of autophagy including accumulation of numerous vesicles
with distinct double membranes (Fig. 1A). RSV also induced
LC3-II accumulation, a hallmark of autophagy (Fig. 1B). In
the meantime, imatinib failed to induce LC3-II accumulation
in contrast with rapamycin, used as a positive control for autophagy induction. RSV-mediated induction of autophagy
was accompanied by increased expression of ATG3 and
p62 (Fig. 1B). The increased accumulation of p62 is consistent with RSV triggering stress-mediated autophagy. Thus,
autophagy may function to prevent the accumulation of
damaged organelles during RSV-induced metabolic stress.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis established that endogenous LC3 and p62 interacted together (Fig. 1C). Importantly,
both LC3-I and LC3-II were able to interact with p62 in IM-S
and IM-R cells and this interaction was increased in RSVtreated cells. Colocalization of p62 with GFP-LC3 was confirmed further by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1D). This is the
first evidence that LC3 and p62 could bind together in intact
cells.
Pharmacologic inhibition of caspases and vacuolar
ATPase prevents RSV-mediated loss of cell viability. We
have reported that RSV induced caspase activation in both
IM-S and IM-R K562 cells (13). We thus investigated whether
inhibition of caspases or targeting lysosomes altered the antileukemic effect of RSV. Inhibition of vacuolar ATPase by bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) or caspases by zVAD-fmk prevented
RSV-mediated loss of cell viability by 35% and 45% in IM-S
cells, respectively (Fig. 2A).
The combination of both inhibitors was most potent that
each one separately, inducing an overall 60% increase in cell
viability in RSV-treated cells. Although zVAD-fmk clearly protects K562 cells from imatinib-induced loss of cell viability,
Baf A1 had no effect. These results strongly suggest that
the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the effect of RSV and
imatinib are different. In addition, Baf A1 and zVAD-fmk
also protected IM-R cells from RSV-mediated loss of viability
(Fig. 2A, left).

In long-term clonogenic assays, the percentage of colonyforming IM-S cells was drastically reduced upon imatinib
and RSV treatment but only the RSV effect was prevented
by Baf A1 (Fig. 2A, right). As expected, the clonogenic potential of IM-R cells was not altered by imatinib treatment.
To investigate whether autophagy was involved in the effect of RSV, we inhibited it using LC3 or ATG5 siRNAs. None
of these siRNAs, which drastically reduced the expression of
both proteins (Fig. 2B), were capable of promoting increased
cell viability in the presence of imatinib (Fig. 2C). In contrast,
knockdown of ATG5 (Fig. 2C, left) or LC3 promoted protection against RSV-mediated cell death in IM-S and IM-R cells
(Fig. 2C, right). As RSV triggers both apoptosis and autophagy in K562 cells, we next analyzed whether these two
events could depend on each other. Caspase 3 activation
and LC3-II accumulation were detected for low doses of
RSV (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, both accounted
for RSV-mediated loss of cell metabolism because the combination of zVAD-fmk and Baf A1 was more potent in preventing RSV-induced cell death compared with each drug
separately (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
RSV activates the JNK pathway to induce p62. The molecular mechanisms underlying the antileukemic effect of
RSV are ill-defined. To further decipher the mode of action
of this compound, we analyzed the effect of RSV on the main
cellular signaling pathways that are constitutively modulated
in CML cells, including p38MAPK, JNK, ERK1/2, PI3K, mTOR,
PKA, and PKC. Pharmacologic inhibition suggested that JNK
was important for the RSV effect (data not shown). Accordingly, RSV triggered JNK activation, as soon as 2 to 4 hours
after its addition in IM-S and IM-R cells, a response maintained for at least 48 hours (Fig. 3A).
Of note, JNK activation correlated with an increased c-Jun
phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). As expected, the effect of RSV on
JNK activation and c-Jun phosphorylation were abrogated by
SP600125 (SP), a specific JNK inhibitor. Because RSV induced
p62 expression in K562 cells (Fig. 1), we investigated whether
JNK was implicated. In support of this, an RSV-mediated increase in p62 mRNA level was prevented by SP in IM-S and
IM-R clones as well (Fig. 3B). In addition, electron microscopy
images revealed that induction of autophagy by RSV was also
abrogated by SP (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, SP drastically reduced
both p62 expression and LC3-II accumulation (Fig. 3D). These
findings show that RSV triggered autophagy and p62 accumulation through the activation of JNK in CML cell lines.
p62 is required for RSV-mediated autophagy. To investigate whether p62 accumulation was responsible for RSVmediated autophagy and CML cell death, we knocked down
p62 using two different siRNAs. We verified that both siRNAs
abrogated p62 expression 4 days after their addition in the
culture medium (Fig. 4A). p62 knockdown resulted in a total
blockage of LC3-II accumulation, and importantly, promoted
increased cell viability in the presence of RSV in IM-S
(Fig. 4B, top) and IM-R cells (Fig. 4B, bottom). By contrast,
p62 inhibition failed to restore cell viability in the presence
of imatinib (data not shown).
RSV also regulates autophagy through AMPK-dependent
inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Because recent results in

because redundancy had been previously reported for these
isoforms (31).
The combination of both siRNAs led to a nearly complete
abrogation of AMPKα and LC3-II accumulation (Fig. 5B),
indicating that AMPK also mediated the effect of RSV on
autophagy. In agreement with these findings, the expression
of a constitutively activated mTOR plasmid in K562 cells
abrogated RSV-mediated LC3-II accumulation but increased
S6 ribosomal and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation, underlying the
role of AMPK in RSV-mediated autophagy (Fig. 5C). The
next question was to determine if the effect of RSV on
AMPK and JNK were interrelated. In a first approach, we
established that SP failed to inhibit the effect of RSV on
P70/85-S6K, S6 ribosomal and 4-EBP1 phosphorylations
suggesting that RSV activated AMPK and JNK independently or that AMPK acted upstream of JNK. Knockdown of
AMPK failed to inhibit RSV-mediated activation of JNK
(Fig. 5B) and p62 expression (data not shown), definitely
demonstrating the nonredundant role of both pathways in
the RSV effect. Interestingly, all the signal transduction
pathways mediated by RSV occurred in Baf/3-p210BCRABL wild-type and Baf/3-p210BCR-ABL T315I cells as well
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Next, we analyzed the possible relationship between apoptosis and autophagy in the RSV ef-

fect. Inhibition of RSV-mediated caspase activation by
zVAD-fmk neither modulated LC3-II accumulation nor
p62 induction (Supplementary Fig. S3A), indicating that caspases did not participate in autophagy. By contrast, knockdown of either LC3, Atg5, or AMPK (Supplementary Fig.
S3B–D) inhibited RSV-mediated caspase 3 activation as well
as the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Altogether, these findings indicate that impairing caspase activation has no effect on RSV-mediated autophagy, whereas
inhibition of autophagy inhibits RSV-induced caspase activation and apoptosis.
RSV-mediated autophagic cell death in CD34+ cells from
patients with CML. Finally, we investigated the effect of RSV
on CD34+ stem cells from patients with CML. CD34+ cells
were purified on magnetic beads coated with anti-CD34
monoclonal antibodies. For each patient, the purity of
CD34+ estimated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting was
found to be at least 90%. RSV induced LC3-II accumulation in
CD34+ cells are shown for a representative patient (Fig. 6A).
As in CML cell lines, this was accompanied by a net increase
in p62 expression and c-Jun phosphorylation.
In addition, RSV significantly reduced S6 and 4-EBP1
phosphorylation in CD34+ cell samples from patients with
CML as judged by phosphoflow experiments (Fig. 6B).

D, IM-S cells (105/mL) were stimulated for 48 h with RSV (25 and 50 μmol/L), SP (10 μmol/L), or the combination of both effectors. Cell lysates were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE and the phosphorylation status of AMPKα, p70/85-S6K, S6 ribosomal, and 4EBP1 proteins was analyzed with specific antibodies.
HSP60 was used as a loading control.

Next, we investigated the effect of RSV on CD34+ cell viability and metabolism. RSV induced the death of purified
CD34+ cells from CML patients with a maximal effect at
50 μmol/L as shown by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 6C).
Finally, cell viability was determined on CD34+ cells from five
different patients. RSV was found to be more effective than
imatinib in inhibiting cell viability (Fig. 6D). Baf A1 inhibited
RSV but not imatinib-mediated loss of cell metabolism, in
agreement with the result of Fig. 2, confirming the importance of lysosomes and autophagy in the RSV effect. In contrast, Baf A1 failed to prevent imatinib-mediated cell death in
CD34+ cells.

Discussion
The antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic effects of RSV
involved various signaling mechanisms including increased
antioxidant capacity through the induction of phase II enzymes, cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis of transformed cells, suppression of invasion and metastasis, and
sensitization to chemotherapy-triggered apoptosis (32). However, the signaling pathways mediated by RSV to induce its
complex antileukemic effects in cancer cells remain incompletely elucidated. We have previously reported that RSV induces caspase activation leading to the apoptosis of IM-S and

IM-R CML cell lines, a mechanism that explains, only in part,
its potent antileukemic effect (13).
In this study, we show that RSV induces autophagy in IM-S
and IM-R cells as well. This effect is mediated through both
the activation of AMPK and JNK that participate independently with the initiation and elongation steps of autophagy,
respectively. Indeed, RSV through AMPK-dependent mTOR
inhibition promotes the formation of phagophores, whereas
activation of JNK favors elongation via induction of p62 expression and its binding to LC3. In agreement with this model (Supplementary Fig. S4), blockage of autophagy by siRNAs
directed against LC3, p62, or AMPK promotes CML cell survival, suggesting that RSV induces autophagic cell death.
Scarletti and colleagues reported recently that RSV induces
caspase-dependent and -independent cell death in MCF7 cells
expressing caspase 3 but only caspase-independent cell death
in MCF7 cells lacking this caspase (21). Indeed, RSV activates
noncanonical Beclin-1–independent autophagy in both cell
lines that, however, acts as a caspase-independent cell death

mechanism only in MCF7 cells deficient for caspase 3. Accordingly, we reported earlier that in CML cells, RSV induces
both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death (13).
However, inhibition of caspase activation by zVAD-fmk neither affected RSV-induced LC3-II accumulation nor p62
expression, suggesting that RSV-mediated apoptosis did
not interfere with induction of autophagy (Supplementary
Fig. S3). By contrast, inhibition of RSV-mediated autophagy
partly prevented caspase 3 activation, suggesting that RSVmediated autophagy contributes to RSV-induced apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). Therefore, in CML cells, RSV mediated autophagic cell death by caspase-independent mechanisms. However, RSV-mediated autophagy is involved at least
partly in the induction of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4).
We also show that RSV triggered JNK activation and that inhibition of JNK by SP prevented RSV-mediated induction of autophagy and CML cell death. In contrast, JNK inhibition fails to
alter RSV-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5D). Therefore, JNK plays a
crucial role in RSV-mediated autophagic but not apoptotic cell

Figure 6. RSV increases autophagic cell death in CD34+ CML primary cells. A, CD34+ primary cells from patients were stimulated for 48 h with RSV.
LC3-I cleavage, p62 expression, and c-Jun phosphorylation and expression were analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. HSP60 was used
as a loading control. B, CD34+ cells from four patients were stimulated for 48 h with 50 μmol/L of RSV. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated
with anti–phosphorylated S6 or anti–phosphorylated 4EBP1 antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. C, CD34+ primary cells were left untreated or
stimulated with RSV (25 and 50 μmol/L) and photographed 48 h later (magnification, ×200). D, CD34+ primary cells were preincubated for 1 h with or without
zVAD-fmk (50 μmol/L), bafilomycin A1 (5 nmol/L), or the combination of both effectors and next exposed to imatinib (1 μmol/L) or RSV (50 μmol/L) for
the next 48 h. Cell viability was assessed using the XTT assay. Columns, mean of four different determinations; bars, SD (P < 0.05 was considered

RSV Mediates Autophagy in CML Cells via JNK and AMPK

death. The function of JNK in autophagy regulation is emerging. It has been reported that JNK activation elicited by IRE1 in
the early phase of endoplasmic reticulum stress is crucial for
autophagosome formation and accumulation (33). In the same
line, Li and colleagues described previously that SP could inhibit autophagy induction by ceramide (34). They proposed that
activation of the JNK pathway mediates Beclin-1 expression,
which in turn, plays a key role in autophagic cell death in cancer cells. Clearly, this is not the case in our study because RSV
fails to induce the expression of Beclin-1 (data not shown).
With regards to RSV, there are conflicting results in the literature regarding its effect on JNK modulation. Indeed, some
groups reported activation of JNK by this phytoalexin (35,
36), whereas others described inhibition (37, 38). Nevertheless,
our findings clearly show that in CML cells, RSV acts as a potent inductor of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation.
An interesting finding of our study is that RSV-mediated
JNK activation leads to increased expression of p62 mRNA
and protein levels. Although JNK has been associated with
an increase in autophagy gene expression (34, 39, 40), this
is to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence that p62
expression is regulated by JNK. Of note, we (27) and others
(41) have previously reported an increased expression of p62
with phorbol esters, whereas pangenomic profiles have identified p62 as a gene upregulated by RSV in both IM-S and IMR cells.7 However, whether or not this effect relies on JNK
activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate remains to be
determined. p62 plays an important role in the control of
bone homeostasis because p62 knockout mice display defects in osteoclastogenesis as a consequence of inefficient activation of NFκB in osteoclasts (42). p62 also has a role in the
control and the clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins,
thereby lessening toxicity and tissue damage (43). In addition, recent studies in the literature have highlighted a new
and important function of p62 in promoting tumorigenesis.
Indeed, Duran and colleagues showed that p62 is an important NFκB mediator in tumorigenesis in a Ras-induced model of lung carcinoma in mice (44). In addition, Mathew and
colleagues reported that autophagy induction triggered p62
elimination, thereby suppressing tumorigenesis (45). Although this suggested the potential function of p62 as a tumor suppressor, the role of NFκB in both studies seems
contradictory. RSV has been shown to inhibit tumor necrosis
factor-α–mediated NFκB activation in the K562 cell line (46).
Therefore, it is very unlikely that NFκB could be involved in
p62 expression in CML cells treated with RSV.

Puissant and colleagues, unpublished data.

RSV also induced phase II enzyme expression such as
NQO1 and HMOX-1 by activation of NRF2, a transcription
factor that binds to antioxidant response elements located
in the promoter region of phase II enzymes (47). Thus, an
interesting possibility would be that RSV triggered p62 expression through NRF2 activation. In addition, p62 expression is stimulated by Ras and during metabolic stress in
apoptosis and autophagy-deficient tumor cells (44).
Importantly, p62 mRNA expression is induced during Rasinduced transformation through both PI3K and Erk1/2. In
this study, it was shown that the p62 promoter could bind
activator protein-1 and that deletion or point mutation in
this site was sufficient to abolish p62 transcription in response to Ras. We (27) and others (41) have shown that phorbol esters drastically increased p62 expression in CML cells.
As JNK is known to induce activator protein-1 expression,
one interesting possibility would be that RSV increased p62
expression through activator protein-1.
It has been proposed that RSV might transduce part of its
effect through AMPK activation (29, 30). In agreement with
these findings, we report that RSV does activate AMPK in
CML cells. In addition, we showed that AMPK activation
by RSV is required for the formation of phagophores, but
not for JNK and p62-dependent elongation of phagophores.
Finally, these two pathways seem to be both necessary to
jointly induce autophagic cell death in CML cells.
In conclusion, we report here that RSV promotes autophagic cell death in CML cells through both JNK-mediated p62
expression and AMPK activation, an effect which participates
significantly to its antileukemic effects. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the JNK and
AMPK pathways cooperate to induce autophagic elimination
of CML cells. Therefore, induction of autophagic cell death
could be beneficial especially in IM-R CD34+ cells from
CML patients that displayed impaired-drug induced apoptotic cell death.
