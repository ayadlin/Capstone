Abstract
As the major barrier to curative cancer chemotherapy, chemoresistance presents
a formidable challenge to both cancer researchers and clinicians. We have previously
shown that the bladder cancer (BCa) cell line 5637 is significantly more sensitive to
the cytoxicity of five chemotherapeutic agents than H-bc cells. Using an RNA-seqbased omic analysis and validation at both the mRNA and protein levels, we found
that the inhibitor of growth 5 (ING5) gene was upregulated in 5637 cells compared
with H-bc cells, indicating that it has an inhibitory role in BCa chemoresistance. siRNAmediated inhibition of ING5 increased the chemoresistance and inhibited the DNA
damage response pathway in 5637 cells. Conversely, forced expression of EGFP-ING5
decreased the chemoresistance of and activated the DNA damage response pathway
in H-bc cells. We also showed that ING5 gene expression is inhibited by miR-193a3p and is instrumental in miR-193a-3p’s role in activating BCa chemoresistance. Our
results demonstrate both the role and mechanism of inhibition of BCa chemoresistance
by ING5.

Introduction

from post-surgery chemotherapy [3], recurrent disease
affects a high percentage of patients and is often resistant
to 2nd-round chemotherapy [4], regardless of previous
drug exposure [5]. Both intrinsic and acquired resistance
to chemotherapeutics are common and vary drastically
among cancer patients and among the different cancerous
lesions or different regions of the same lesion within a

Bladder cancer (BCa) is the fourth-most common
type of urogenital cancer in humans and the one that
causes the greatest mortality [1]. It is notorious for both
wide-spread resistance to drug treatments and high
recurrence rates [2]. Although 50% of patients benefit

single patient [6], making effective chemoresistance
prediction and therapy impossible tasks.
Despite years of intensive effort, our understanding
of multi-chemoresistance in cancer remains limited [710]. The mechanisms implicated include inefficient
cellular drug uptake and accumulation, activation of
the antioxidant glutathione system for detoxification,
enhancement of DNA repair, and up-regulation of antiapoptosis pathways [11-13]. The best-characterized genes
that have been implicated in this multi-chemoresistance
are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as
P-glycoprotein (P-gp); breast cancer resistance proteins
(BCRPs); and multi-drug resistance-associated proteins
(MRPs) [14-16], which are over-expressed in multichemoresistant cancer cells [17]. Other protein-coding
genes involved in BCa chemoresistance include ADAM10
[18], HIPK2 [19] and Nrf2 [20].
To find new protein-coding genes that are
instrumental in BCa multi-chemoresistance, we
conducted an RNA-seq-based omic analysis of a multichemosensitive BCa cell line (5637 cells) versus a resistant

cell line (H-bc) [21] and identified 9051 differentially
expressed protein-coding genes (not shown), including the
inhibitor of growth 5 (ING5) gene. In the present study,
we performed a systematic analysis of the ING5 gene
for its role in BCa chemoresistance and its mechanisms
of action. Furthermore, we showed that ING5 is a direct
target of miR-193a-3p and mediates a significant part of
miR-193a-3p’s effect on multi-chemoresistance in BCa.

chemoresistance-associated expression of the ING5 gene
was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis at the steady state
mRNA level and a Western blot analysis at the protein
level. The results showed that the ING5 protein (1.00:0.61,
Fig. 1A and C) and mRNA expression levels were higher
(RNA-seq-based omic: 1.00:0.28, and qRT-PCR analysis:
1.00:0.72, Fig. 1A and B) in 5637 cells than in H-bc cells.
To demonstrate its potential role in BCa
chemoresistance, we suppressed ING5 mRNA expression
to 33%, 47% and 21% of the NC control in 5637 cells
by transfection of si-ING5-1, -2 and -3, respectively
(Fig. 1D). The levels of drug-triggered cell death in the
transfected cells at the IC50 of various drugs (paclitaxel,
Pa; Adriamycin, Ad; cisplatin, Ci; pirarubicin, Pi;
epirubicin hydrochloride, EH) was then determined. The
most effective siRNA (si-ING5-1) relieved cell death in
the 5637 cells stressed by all five drugs except Pa. The
2nd most effective siRNA (si-ING5-3) failed to desensitize
5637 cells to the cell-killing effects of Pa and Ci, while
the least effective siRNA (si-ING5-2) was only able to
reduce cell death in the EH-treated 5637 cells. These
observations suggest that ING5’s effect on the drug

type-specific chemoresistance of 5637 cells is sensitive
to the expression of the ING5 gene within the cell (Fig.
1E). We further showed that forced upregulation of GFPtagged ING5 protein (by Western blot analysis, Fig. 1F,
and immunofluorescence analysis, Fig. S1) desensitized
the transfected H-bc cells to the cell death triggered by all
five drugs (Fig. 1G). In conclusion, ING5 had a significant
effect on drug-triggered cell death for four ( Ad, Ci, Pi and
EH) of the five drugs tested in BCa cells.

ING5 is a direct target of miR-193a-3p in BCa
cells
The critical role of microRNA (miR) genes in the
multi-chemoresistance of cancer has been well established
[22]. The eminent examples for BCa chemoresistance are
miR-30d, miR-181, miR-199a-5p [23] and miR-193a-3p
[21, 24]. The DNA methylation-regulated miR-193a3p confers 5-FU resistance to hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) by repressing SRSF2 expression [24]. MiR-193a3p also promotes multi-chemoresistance in BCa cells

by suppressing SRSF2, HIC2 PLAU, LOXL4, PSEN1
and HOXC9 and altering the activities of five signaling
pathways: DNA damage, Notch, NF-κB, Myc/Max
and oxidative stress [21-24]. The miR-193a-3p level is
significantly lower in 5637 than in H-bc cells, while its
target genes SRSF2, HIC2 and PLAU are lower in H-bc
than in 5637 cells [21], a pattern also displayed by ING5
in this pair of cell lines (Fig. 1A).
Incidentally, ING5 was on the list of miR-193a-3p
targets suggested by TargetScan software (http://www.
targetscan.org/). Therefore, we determined the ING5 level
in miR-193a-3p mimic-transfected 5637 and antagomiRtransfected H-bc versus NC (a scrambled-sequence
control)-transfected cells. In parallel with changes in
the miR-193a-3p level (Fig. 2A), miR-193a-3p mimic
transfection suppressed ING5 mRNA expression to nearly
76% (Fig. 2B) and protein expression to 25% (Fig. 2C)
of the NC level in 5637 cells. Transfection with the miR193a-3p antagomiR raised the ING5 mRNA level to 141%
(Fig. 2B) and the protein level to 145% of the level in the
NC-transfected H-bc cells (Fig. 2C).
Next, we inserted the ING5 UTR (1-1037 bp) with
either a wild-type or mutant miR-193-3p target sequence
downstream of the firefly luciferase gene into the pGL3control vector (Promega) to create the pGL3-ING5 UTR
WT or the pGL3-ING5 UTR Mut construct, respectively
(Fig. 2D). The pGL3-ING5 UTR WT, pGL3-ING5 UTR
Mut and pGL3 constructs were individually transfected
into 5637 and H-bc cells. The firefly luciferase activity
was measured to determine whether the differentially
expressed miR-193a-3p in this pair of cell lines was
functional. As shown in Fig. 2E, pGL3-ING5-UTR
WT but not the other 2 reporter constructs produced
significantly higher luciferase activity in 5637 than in H-bc
cells. Furthermore, only the luciferase activity of pGL3ING5-UTR WT was suppressed in the mimic-transfected
5637 cells and upregulated in the antagomiR-transfected
H-bc cells relative to the pGL3 control (Fig. 2E). In
conclusion, the ING5 gene is a direct post-transcriptional
target of miR-193-3p.
We further compared the levels of drug-triggered
cell death in 5637 cells transfected with miR-193a-3p
mimic versus ING5 siRNAs. Whereas miR-193a-3p
reduced the ING5 level to 40%, all three si-RNAs reduced
the ING5 protein level to no more than 30% of the NC
control and had no suppressive effects on the LOXL4
protein, another direct target of miR-193a-3p (Fig. 3A).
The ING5 mRNA level was also reduced by miR-193a3p and the siRNAs to comparable degrees (Fig. 3A).
Although the miR-193a-3p mimic had a relatively weaker
repressive effect on ING5, the mimic-transfected 5637
cells suffered less drug-triggered death in response to all
five IC50-dosed drugs (Fig. 3B), while only the most potent
siRNA (si-ING5-1) significantly (but to a reduced extent
in the cells stressed by Ad, Ci or Pi) decreased the level
of cell death in 5637 cells stressed by Ad, Ci, Pi or EH,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

but not Pa (Fig. 3B). The observed disparity between the
miR-193a-3p mimic and the most effective siRNA against
ING5 (si-ING5-1) in terms of drug-triggered cell death
is likely attributable to the downregulation of other miR193a-3p target proteins, such as SRSF2, PLAU, HIC2 and
LOXL4 (shown in Fig. 3A) in mimic-transfected but not
in si-ING5-1-transfected 5637 cells (Fig. 3B). Incidentally,
the siRNA (-1, -2 and -3, respectively)-mediated ING5
repression reduced the percentage of late-apoptotic (and
necrotic) cells from 11.4% (the right upper quadrant in
Fig. 3C) to 4.33%, 4.90%, and 4.62% and decreased the
percentage of early-stage apoptotic cells (the right lower
quadrant) from 2.96% to 1.23%, 1.20% and 1.89% (Fig.
3C and 3E). Intriguingly, although miR-193a-3p mimic
had the strongest resistance-promoting effect (Fig. 3B), it
had a lower anti-apoptotic effect than the ING5 siRNAs
(Fig. 3C), implying that other mechanisms, including
G2 arrest, may be involved. Indeed, we have previously
shown that miR-193a-3p mimic causes G2 arrest in 5637
cells [25, 26], an effect that was not observed in ING5
siRNA-transfected 5637 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
In the reverse experiment, the miR-193a-3p antagomiR
sensitized the H-bc cells to the cytotoxicity caused by all
five drugs, as did the GFP-ING5 expression constructs, to
an even greater extent (Fig. 3C and D).
All of these observations suggest that ING5 acts
as the downstream target of miR-193a-3p, mediating
a significant part of miR-193a-3p’s effect on BCa
chemoresistance to Ad, Ci, Pi and EH in 5637 cells (Fig.
1E and 3B) or to all five drugs in H-bc cells (Figs. 1G and
3D).

ING5 positively regulates the DNA damage
response pathway in the context of BCa multichemoresistance
We recently reported that miR-193a-3p regulates
multi-chemoresistance by repressing the expression of
three of its downstream targets (SRSF2, PLAU, HIC2,
LOXL4, PSEN1 and HOXC9) and in turn altering the
activities of five signaling pathways: DNA damage
response, Notch, NF-κB, Myc/Max and oxidative stress
[21-24]. It is desirable to determine which of these five
pathways are also affected by the forced changes in the
ING5 level in both 5637 and H-bc cells. In parallel with
the reduced ING5 levels (Fig. 3A), the activities of the
DNA damage response, NF-κB and Myc/Max pathways
were repressed by the ING5 siRNAs in a similar fashion
to miR-193a-3p mimic, but they differed in potency.
For example, the activity of the DNA damage response
pathway was reduced by ING5 siRNAs-1, -2 and -3 to
43%, 64% and 48% of the NC level, respectively, but
miR-193a-3p mimic reduced the activity to 17% of the
NC level. We further assessed the changes in the mRNA
levels of several genes in 5637 cells transfected with

of the DNA damage response pathway (CDKN1A and
EDN1) NF-κB (RelA) pathway, and Myc/Max pathway
(TERT and ODC1) as well as ING5. In parallel with

the reduced ING5 mRNA expression levels, both the
CDKN1A and ODC1 mRNA levels were downregulated
(Fig. 4B). Therefore, the ING5 connection to miR-193a-3p
in 5637 cells in the context of BCa multi-chemoresistance
(Figs. 1-3) is most likely attributable to its effect on the

activities of these three pathways that are regulated by
miR-193a-3p.
Last in this line of experiments, we transfected
H-bc cells with a GFP-ING5 expression construct or a
GFP (negative control) construct to overexpress ING5
(Fig. 3C). Only the activity of the DNA damage response
pathway among the pathways examined in 5637 cells
(Fig. 4A) was activated dramatically by both miR-193a3p antagomiR and EGP-ING5 overexpression (Fig. 4C).
Therefore, ING5’s role in mediating miR-193a-3p’s effect
on BCa chemoresistance is principally accomplished by its
impact on the DNA damage response pathway.

In our previous study, we showed that miR-193a3p promotes Pa chemoresistance in BCa cells in tumor
xenografts of nude mice by repressing three of its targets
in the tumor tissues: SRSF2, PLAU and HIC2 [21]. In the
present study, we semi-quantified the ING5 levels (Fig. 5)
in the same set of the xenografts by immunohistological
analysis. The injection of either miR-193a-3p agomiR
into 5637 tumor xenografts or of the antagomiR into
H-bc tumor xenografts indeed led the opposite changes

5). This observation further strengthens the notion that
ING5 has a role in miR-193a-3p’s effect promoting Pachemoresistance in BCa cells.

s1-transfected 5637 cells (Fig. S2). Furthermore, only
the DNA damage response pathway among the five
pathways affected by miR-193a-3p was influenced by
the changed level of ING5 protein in both 5637 and H-bc
cells (Fig. 4). MiR-193a-3p potently promotes multichemoresistance in both HCC [24] and BCa by repressing
its three downstream targets: SRSF2, PLAU, HIC2 ,
LOXL4, PSEN1 and HOXC9 [21-24]. siRNA-mediated
repression of each of these three genes only partially
reproduces the effects of miR-193a-3p mimic on 5637
cells in terms of drug-triggered cell death and pathway
activity [21]. The data suggest that the collective effects of
the reduced levels of those three proteins as well as ING5
(in this report) contribute to miR-193a-3p’s impact on
BCa chemoresistance, which cannot be fully reproduced
by altering the level of any single target in 5637 or H-bc
cells. It is therefore not unexpected that the most effective
siRNA against ING5 repressed ING5 protein more than
miR-193a-3p did but relieved drug-triggered cell death to
a lesser extent in the transfected 5637 cells in both a drug
type-specific and quantitative manner (Fig. 3B).
ING5 is the most recently discovered and least
characterized member of the inhibitor of growth (ING)
family. It is mutated at a significant frequency in all types
of cancers examined (COSMIC http://cancer.sanger.
ac.uk]). A network analysis performed by combining
literature data with an analysis of the public proteinprotein interaction databases Wiki-PI [http://severus.dbmi.

Discussion
Despite years of intensive research efforts, the
underlying mechanisms of cancer multi-chemoresistance
remain elusive. To identify new protein-coding genes
that are instrumental to BCa multi-chemoresistance, we
performed a comparative RNA-seq omic analysis of a
multi-chemosensitive (5637) and a resistant cell line (Hbc) and identified a panel of differentially expressed genes.
The ING5 gene, which was more highly expressed in 5637
than in H-bc cells, was systematically studied in both
cultured cells (Figs. 1-4) and tumor xenografts in nude
mice (Fig. 5). The ING5 gene is a direct target of miR193a-3p (Figs. 2-5). In forced-expression experiments,
ING5 improved cell survival in response to four (in 5637
cells) or five drugs (in H-bc cells), essentially mimicking
the effect of miR-193a-3p (Fig. 3). In agreement with a
previous report showing that forced knockdown of ING5
reduces cell apoptosis [27], the percentage of apoptotic
cells was reduced in the ING5 siRNA-transfected 5637
cells to a greater extent than following transfection with
a miR-193a-3p mimic (Fig. 3E). However, the G2 arrest
effect of miR-193a-3p was not observed in si-ING5-

pitt.edu/wiki-pi/] and BioGRID 3.2 [http://thebiogrid.org/]
has linked the ING5 gene to the DNA damage pathway.
ING5 directly interacts with p53 and EP300 (http://
severus.dbmi.pitt.edu/wiki-pi/index.php/search?q=ING5
and http://thebiogrid.org/124016/summary/homo-sapiens/
ing5.html) and acts as a key component of the HBO1containing HAT complex that increases the acetylation
states of both histone and nonhistone proteins such as p53
[28, 29]. It promotes p53-dependent pathways and in turn
induces apoptosis and negatively regulates tumorigenesis
[27, 30-32]. In this context, ING5 acts as an important
cofactor of the Tip60 (the catalytic subunit of the NuA4
histone acetyltransferase complex)-centered complex that
increases the K120 acetylation of p53 in stressed cells
where apoptosis and/or cell-cycle arrest are induced [27,
33]. ING5 can bind with p53 and EP300, a component
of the histone acetyl transferase complex, suggesting that
it is involved in a p53-dependent regulatory pathway
[33]. Indeed, the DNA damage response pathway with
p53 as the master transcription factor is the principal
pathway affected by both ING5 and its upstream regulator
miR-193a-3p (Fig. 4). The other two pathways likely
to be regulated are NF-κB and Myc/Max (Fig. 4A), as
suggested by our observations in 5637 cells but not in
H-bc cells (Fig. 4C). By qRT-PCR analysis, we showed
that CDKN1A (a target of the DNA damage response
pathway), RelA (a target of the NF-κB pathway), and

TERT and ODC1 (targets of the Myc/Max pathway) were
downregulated in ING5 siRNA-transfected 5637 cells
(Fig. 4C). Moreover, TIP60 is involved in transcriptional
activation principally by acetylating nucleosomal histones,
and it interacts with the NF-κB RelA/p65 subunit to
increase the transcriptional activity of p65 through
protein-protein interaction [34]. The NF-κB pathway is
functionally antagonistic to p53 in multiple tumor types
[35, 36]. Moreover, the transcriptional activation by
c-MYC relies in part on its ability to recruit the TIP60containing complexes and the subsequent acetylation [37].
As a crucial inhibitor of p53, MDM2 is transcriptionally
activated by both NF-κB and p53 and binds/inhibits the
p65 RelA subunit of NF-κB [38]. Additionally, there are
reports of functional links between the ING5 gene and
the Myc/Max pathway, chiefly involving p53 as a critical
mediator within the ARF–Mdm2–p53 regulatory loop [3941].
ING5 contains a PHD-finger domain, a common
motif in proteins with a chromatin remodeling function
[42], aiding in the acetylation of the core histones [43].
However, neither miR-193a-3p mimic transfection nor
the knockdown of ING5 in 5637 cells reduced the overall
acetylation level of histone H3 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
More research is needed to better understand ING5’s role
in the control of the overall acetylation state of the core
histones and therefore genomic transcriptional activities.

constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were
seeded into 96-well plates at approximately 1x104 cells per
well and transfected with a mixture of 50 ng of pGL3-lucING5 WT or Mut, 5 ng of Renilla plus 5 pmol of mimic
or NC nucleotide using the riboFECT CP transfection kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Both the
firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 18
hours after transfection by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) using a Promega GloMax 20/20
luminometer. The relative firefly luciferase activities of
the UTR constructs and pathway reporter constructs were
analyzed as previously reported [21].

In summary, we showed that the ING5 gene,
together with other downstream genes (SRSF2, PLAU
and HIC2), mediates a significant part of miR-193a3p’s positive impact on multi-chemoresistance in BCa
cells, mainly via its positive impact on the DNA damage
response pathway (summarized in Fig. 6).

Methods
Cell lines
BCa cell lines were purchased from the Chinese
Academy of Cell Resource Center (Shanghai, China):
5637 (ATCC NO. HTB-9) and H-bc (established by
the Cancer Research Institute of Kunming Medical
College, 1986). Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 (Invitrogen, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum
(Invitrogen, USA) and 1% glutamine at 37°C in 5% CO2.

Chemoresistance profiling (IC50 determination)
Clinical-grade (NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms,
http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary), pirarubicin (Pi, Wanle,
Shenzhen) paclitaxel (Pa, Taiji, Sichuan), Adriamycin (Ad,
Pfizer, Jiangsu), epirubicin hydrochloride (EH, Haizheng,
Zhejiang), and cisplatin (Ci, Haosen, Jiangsu) were
used. Relative IC50 values were determined as previously
described [21].

Reagents for the transient transfection assays
The mimic, agomiRs, antagomiRs, siRNAs, the
scrambled sequence (negative control, NC) and the
riboFECT CP transfection kit were supplied by Ribobio
(Guangzhou, China). The GFP-tagged overexpression
ING5 construct (construct from pReciever-M98) was
purchased from Genecopia, (Guangzhou ,China).
Transfection of both the ribonucleic acid reagents
mentioned above and the reporter plasmids was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Chemically modified mimic oligonucleotides
(agomiRs) were synthesized to regulate miR-193a-3p/5p
expression in vivo. The 3’ end of the oligonucleotides
was conjugated to cholesterol, and all of the bases were
2’-OMe modified. The agomiR oligonucleotides were
deprotected, desalted and purified by high-performance
liquid chromatography.
The siRNA sequences used for ING5 interference in
this study were as follows:
si-ING5-1:
5‘ CCAUGUACUUGGAGCACUA dTdT 3‘
3‘ dTdT GGUACAUGAACCUCGUGAU 5‘
si-ING5-2:
5‘ GGAAUACAGUGACGACAAA dTdT 3‘
3‘ dTdT CCUUAUGUCACUGCUGUUU 5‘
si-ING5-3:
5‘ CCUACGAGAUGGUGGAUAA dTdT 3‘
3‘ dTdT GGAUGCUCUACCACCUAUU 5‘

Apoptosis analysis
Cells were harvested and rinsed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) twice. Then, 5 μl of fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled enhanced Annexin V
and 5 μl (20 μg/ml) of propidium iodide were added to
the 100 μl cell suspension. Following incubation in the
dark for 15 min at room temperature, the samples were
diluted with 400 μl PBS. Flow cytometry was carried
out on a FACSCalibur instrument. The results were
analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
experiments were performed independently three times,
and a representative result is shown herein.

RNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the cells at the
logarithmic phase using TRIzol reagent (Tiangen Biotech
Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). For mRNA analysis, cDNA
primed by oligo-dT was generated using a PrimeScript RT
reagent kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China),
and the mRNA levels of the genes were quantified by
duplex-qRT-PCR analysis using TaqMan probes with a
different fluorescence for the β-actin (provided by Shing
Gene, Shanghai, China) and a FTC-3000P PCR instrument
(FUNGLYN BIOTECH INC, Canada). Using the 2-∆∆Ct
method, gene expression was normalized to β-actin and
then compared between groups. The sequences of the

peroxidase-conjugated antibody (LP1001b), and HRPconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (LP1002a) were
provided by Wuxiphama, Shanghai, China. The target
bands were revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence
reaction (Pierce), and the relative density of each protein
over GAPDH was quantified using a Gel-Pro Analyzer
(Media Cybernetics).

Bulge-Loop™ miRNA qRT-PCR

Data are presented as the means, and error bars
indicate the standard deviation (S.D.) or standard error
(S.E.). All of the statistical analyses were performed using
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) or Prism (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). The two-tailed Student’s
t-test, one-way analysis of variance or the Mann-Whitney
U test was used to calculate statistical significance. A
P-value of <0.05 was considered significant.

In vivo studies
Animal experiments were performed as previously
described [21]. ING5 protein expression was measured
using immunohistochemical analysis on 5-mm slices
of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor xenografts
in nude mice. To avoid inter-treatment bias, the tissue
slides from all six groups were made on a single slide and
subjected to the same immunostaining simultaneously.
Antigens were retrieved by pretreating dewaxed
sections in a microwave oven at 750 W for 5 min in a
citrate buffer (pH 6) processed with the Super Sensitive
Link-Labeled Detection System (Biogenex, Menarini,
Florence, Italy). The enzymatic activities were developed
using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Dako, Milan, Italy) as a
chromogenic substrate. Following counterstaining with
Mayer’s hematoxylin (Invitrogen), slides were mounted
in aqueous mounting medium (glycergel, Dako). Pictures
were taken using a LEICA DM 4000B microscope, while
the relative level of each protein was calculated using
LEICA software. The percentage of the mock- over the
chemotherapeutic-treated tumors was calculated and
plotted.

Statistical analysis

For detecting and quantifying the expression of
specific miRNAs, RNA was reverse-transcribed using the
Bulge-Loop™ miRNA qRT-PCR Primer Set (Ribobio) and
quantified by SYBR Green-based real-time PCR analysis
in a FTC-3000P (FUNGLYN BIOTECH INC, Canada).
The Ct values of the target miRNAs were normalized to
the Ct values of U6 RNA before quantification using the
2-ΔΔCt method.
