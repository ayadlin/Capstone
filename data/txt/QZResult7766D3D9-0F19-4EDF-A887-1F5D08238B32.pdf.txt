Abstract
The rapalogs everolimus and temsirolimus that inhibit
mTOR signaling are used as antiproliferative drugs in several
cancers. Here we investigated the inﬂuence of rapalogs-mediated immune modulation on their antitumor efﬁcacy. Studies
in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients showed that everolimus promoted high expansion of FoxP3þHeliosþKi67þ
regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs). In these patients, rapalogs
strongly enhanced the suppressive functions of Tregs, mainly
in a contact-dependent manner. Paradoxically, a concurrent
activation of spontaneous tumor-speciﬁc Th1 immunity also
occurred. Furthermore, a high rate of EomesþCD8þ T cells was
detected in patients after a long-term mTOR inhibition. We
found that early changes in the Tregs/antitumor Th1 balance

can differentially shape the treatment efﬁcacy. Patients presenting a shift toward decreased Tregs levels and high expansion of antitumor Th1 cells showed better clinical responses.
Studies conducted in tumor-bearing mice conﬁrmed the deleterious effect of rapalogs-induced Tregs via a mechanism
involving the inhibition of antitumor T-cell immunity. Consequently, the combination of temsirolimus plus CCR4 antagonist, a receptor highly expressed on rapalogs-exposed Tregs,
was more effective than monotherapy. Altogether, our results
describe for the ﬁrst time a dual impact of host adaptive
antitumor T-cell immunity on the clinical effectiveness of
rapalogs and prompt their association with immunotherapies.

Introduction

mTOR signaling induces several processes required for the
growth, survival, and proliferation of cancer cells (2). Thus, mTOR
inhibition has gained great interest in cancer therapy and many
rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are now being used in clinical
settings (3). Everolimus and temsirolimus are two rapalogs
approved for breast cancer, neuroendocrine carcinoma treatments, and relapsing metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC)
patients (4–7).
mTOR also represents a key regulator of immune responses.
Notably, this pathway is determinant for the differentiation,
homeostasis, and functional regulation of both CD4 and CD8
T-cell subsets (8). The lack of mTOR in na€ve CD4 T cells has been
shown to promote preferentially forkhead box transcription factor (FoxP3þ) regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the detriment of Th1, Th2,
or Th17 differentiation (9, 10). In solid organ transplantation,
rapalogs promote Tregs induction and create an immunosuppressive environment required to prevent from graft rejection (11, 12).
Interestingly, it has been recently reported that organ transplant
recipients treated with rapalogs have a lower risk of developing
cancer, suggesting an impact of mTOR inhibition on antitumor
immune responses (13). Indeed, recent immunologic studies
showed that blocking mTOR signaling can also promote memory
T-cell functions and tumor immunity in animal models (14–16).
However, the rapalogs-mediated modulation of antitumor T-cell
immunity and its impact on treatment efﬁcacy have not been
investigated in patients with cancer.
On the basis of the critical role played by adaptive T-cell
immunity in cancer (17, 18), we hypothesized that anticancer
rapalogs could promote suppressive Tregs, which in turn could

Immune-Mediated Antitumor Efﬁcacy of Rapalogs

be detrimental for host antitumor T-cell immunity. In this
regard, we recently described a striking modulation of T-cell
responses in a mRCC patient treated with everolimus (19).
This patient presented at the time of disease control a strong
antitumor Th1 response, which was completely lost upon
disease progression when high Tregs expansion occurred.
Here, we studied the modulation of both Tregs and antitumor
T-cell responses in a cohort of mRCC patients treated with everolimus. The inﬂuence of immune modulation on treatment
efﬁcacy was investigated in our cohort and conﬁrmed in mouse
tumor models.

Patients and Methods
Patients and sample collections
mRCC patients treated with everolimus were enrolled after
the signature of informed consent at the University Hospital
Minjoz (Besançon, France) between November 2011 and January 2015. Everolimus was administrated 10 mg daily, or 5 mg
daily when occurrence of adverse events. Blood samples were
collected at baseline and every 2 months. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density centrifugation on Ficoll-Hyperpaque gradient (Sigma-Aldrich) and
frozen until use. Disease was classiﬁed as deﬁned by Heng and
colleagues (20) and evaluation of response was performed
according to RECIST.
Monitoring of Tregs and telomerase-speciﬁc Th1 responses in
mRCC patients
Tregs staining protocol is detailed in Supplementary Materials
section. Samples were acquired on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with the Diva or FlowJo softwares.
Antitumor Th1 responses were assessed after in vitro stimulation
of PBMC with a mixture of HLA-DR–restricted peptides derived
from telomerase (TERT; 5 mg/mL) during 7 days (21, 22). The
presence of speciﬁc T cells was measured by IFNg-ELISPOT
Assay (Diaclone; ref. 21). Spot-forming cells were counted using
the C.T.L. Immunospot System (Cellular Technology Ltd). The
number of speciﬁc T cells expressed as spot-forming cells per
105 cells was calculated after subtracting negative control values
(background). Responses were positive when IFNg spots number was higher than 10 and more than twice the background.
Tregs suppressive assay
Tregs functions were evaluated in a CellTrace 5-(and 6-) carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled T-cell
Proliferation Assay (Invitrogen). Brieﬂy, 5  105 fresh allogenic
T cells from healthy donors labeled with CFSE were cocultured for
3 days at 1:2 ratio with freshly sorted Tregs from healthy donors or
patients, or at 1:1 ratio with sorted Tregs from in vitro culture in the
presence of coated anti-CD3 (2.5 mg/mL) and soluble anti-CD28
(5 mg/mL) antibodies (BD Biosciences). Cytokines production
was measured by ELISA (Diaclone). Proliferation suppression
assays were also performed using transwell columns (Merck
Millipore) to separate 3  105 Tregs (top chambers) from 3 
105 allogenic T cells (bottom chambers) in the presence of soluble
anti-CD3 (5 mg/mL) and anti-CD28 (5 mg/mL) antibodies (BD
Biosciences).
Tumor cell lines
The murine RCC RENCA and the melanoma-B16F10 cells
transfected with ovalbumin (B16-OVA) were kindly provided by

www.aacrjournals.org

E. Tartour (INSERM U970). The murine mammary carcinoma cell
line 4T1 was kindly provided by Dr. Apetoh (INSERM U866,
Dijon, France). All cells were periodically authenticated by morphologic and histologic inspection, and animal grafting for assessing their ability to grow. Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma using Myco Alert Kit (Lonza).
Mice
Female C57BL/6NCrl and BALB/cAnCrl mice, 6 to 8 weeks
old, were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and
housed under pathogen-free conditions. FoxP3-eGFP and
DEREG transgenic mice (23) were kindly provided by Dr.
Perruche (INSERM UMR1098, Besançon, France). All experimental studies were approved by the local ethics committee
(#58) and the French Ministry of Higher Education and
Research and were conducted in accordance with the European
Union's Directive 2010/63.
Tumor challenge and treatment
BALB/cAnCrl mice were subcutaneously injected with 5 
105 RENCA or 105 4T1 cells in 100 mL of saline buffer in the
abdominal ﬂank or in the mammary zone, respectively. C57BL/
6NCrl, FoxP3-eGFP, or DEREG mice were subcutaneously
injected with 2  105 B16-OVA cells in 100 mL of saline buffer
in the abdominal ﬂank. Tumor growth was monitored every 2
to 3 days and mice were euthanized when tumor mass reached
300 mm2. When tumors reach 20 mm2, mice were treated
either with 2 mg/kg of temsirolimus intraperitoneally every
3 days or with everolimus administrated orally everyday by
gavage at 0.65 mg/kg. The rapalogs were used at concentrations
based on the study of their pharmacokinetics in patients (24).
Mice from control groups were injected with the solvent used to
dissolve drugs. Rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was administrated
intraperitoneally at 75 mg/kg/day. The CCR4 antagonist
(AF399/420/18 025) provided by Dr. Bayry (INSERM U872)
was injected intraperitoneally at 1.5 mg/3 days.
In vivo T-cell depletion experiments
To study the implication of immune cells on the antitumor
effect of rapalogs, mice were injected intraperitoneally before
tumor graft then every 2 weeks with 200 mg of monoclonaldepleting antibodies (mAb). Anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5), CD8
(2.43), and CD25 (PC61.5) antibodies or isotype controls were
purchased from BioXcell. To deplete Tregs, mice were injected
intraperitoneally twice (day 4 and day 0) before tumor graft with
250 mg of PC61.5 mAb (BioXcell). DEREG mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 80 mg/kg of diphtheria toxin (SigmaAldrich) to deplete Tregs. Depletion efﬁciency was checked in the
blood.
Assessment of OVA-speciﬁc T-cell responses
The ovalbumin-speciﬁc T cells were analyzed ex vivo in splenocytes and in tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL). TILs were
recovered after tumor treatment with DNAse, hyaluronidase, and
collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich). The OVA257–264 (SIINFEKL, SL8)
Kb-Dextramer (Immudex) staining was used to quantify OVAspeciﬁc CD8 T cells. Functionality of OVA257–264-speciﬁc CD8 T
cells was analyzed by IFNg-ELISPOT on spleen-isolated CD8þ T
cells (Miltenyi Biotec; ref. 25). For anti-OVA CD4 T-cell responses,
spleen-isolated CD4þ T cells were cocultured in presence of

dendritic cells loaded with the OVA protein (10 mg/mL; SigmaAldrich) and T-cell reactivity was analyzed by IFNg-ELISPOT.
Functional analysis of CD4þ TILs was performed by cocultured
TILs in presence of the OVA protein or of a nonantigen-speciﬁc
stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. CD4þ TILs reactivity was
evaluated by using intracytoplasmic IFNg staining.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means  SEM. Statistical comparison
between groups was based on Student t test using Prism 6
GraphPad Software. P values lower than 0.05 ( ) were considered
signiﬁcant. Data cutoff for survival analysis was January 7, 2015.
To determine the impact of the everolimus-mediated immune
modulation on survival, we used a model based on the normalized variation after 2 months of both immune variables Treg
(DTreg) and anti-TERT Th1 (Danti-TERT Th1; Supplementary
Materials section). Mice and patients' survival was estimated using
the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-rank tests were used to compare survival distribution. The exponential regression model was
used to ﬁt the experimental data of the tumor growth (Supplementary Materials section).

Results
Everolimus treatment promotes expansion of highly
suppressive FoxP3þ Tregs in mRCC patients
A prospective immunomonitoring study was conducted in 23
mRCC patients treated with everolimus. The patients' main characteristics are depicted in Supplementary Table S1. The monitoring of FoxP3þ Tregs was performed within blood at baseline and
every 2 months (Supplementary Fig. S1). We observed that both
percentage and absolute number of Tregs gradually increased (at
least >20%) after treatment in 21 of 23 patients (91.3%) compared with baseline (Fig. 1A and B; 3.5% vs. 6.5%, P ¼ 0.0002 and
46 vs. 75  106 Tregs/L, P ¼ 0.0006, respectively, between baseline
and 6 months). In 7 patients, a ﬁrst drop of Tregs levels was
observed before a subsequent increase. Tregs presented the phenotype of natural Tregs (nTregs): CD25hiCD127loFoxP3þHeliosþ
(26) and expressed CTLA-4 and ICOS (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, a
higher expression of Ki67 in Tregs was detected after everolimus
treatment, suggesting a proliferation of this population in vivo
(Fig. 1D). The analysis of total blood lymphocytes showed a
relative stability of these cells during treatment; however, an
increase of total CD4þ T cells was observed, which could be
associated to Tregs expansion (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Tregs function of the patients was then evaluated by analyzing
their ability to inhibit allogenic T-cell proliferation in vitro. As
compared with Tregs of healthy donors, sorted Tregs of patients
exerted a higher inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Interestingly,
inhibition of T-cell proliferation was greatly increased in presence
of Tregs isolated after everolimus as compared with the baseline
(Fig. 1E and F). These results showed that everolimus promotes
expansion of highly suppressive Tregs in mRCC patients.
Rapalogs-exposed Tregs mediate contact-dependent T-cell
suppression in vitro
To conﬁrm the ability of rapalogs to promote highly functional Tregs, we isolated Tregs from PBMCs of healthy donors
cultured 10 days in presence or absence of everolimus or
temsirolimus (Fig 2A). We showed that rapalogs effectively
blocked the phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (ser235)

4102 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

but not Akt (ser473), the downstream targets of mTORC1 and
mTORC2, respectively (Fig. 2B and C).
As compared with nonexposed Tregs, rapalogs-exposed Tregs
strongly inhibited allogenic T-cell proliferation (Fig. 2D and E)
and decreased the effector cell production of IL2 and IFNg (Fig.
2F). To further dissect how rapalogs-exposed Tregs exerted their
suppressive activity, we ﬁrst measured the inhibitory cytokines
IL10 and TGFb1 in the supernatants from T-cell suppressive
assays. No signiﬁcant production of these cytokines was observed
(not shown). Although these Tregs highly expressed CTLA-4, ICOS,
GITR, CD39, and CCR4 (Fig. 2G), the addition of blocking
antibodies against these membrane receptors during T-cell stimulation did not affect the suppressive functions of these Tregs (not
shown). Finally, we performed the same suppressive assays as
before but using a transwell between rapalogs-exposed Tregs and
effector T cells. As shown in Fig. 2H and I, the inhibition of T-cell
proliferation was radically impaired when Tregs were separated
from stimulated allogenic T cells. Similarly, the production of IL2
and IFNg was totally recovered in absence of Tregs–T-cell contact
(Fig. 2J). Thus, rapalogs-exposed Tregs preferentially exert inhibitory activity in a cell contact–dependent manner.
Increase of spontaneous TERT-speciﬁc Th1 response and
Eomesþ CD8 T cells after everolimus treatment
Concurrent to Tregs monitoring, the spontaneous tumor-speciﬁc Th1 response was evaluated in this cohort. To this end, we
performed an IFNg-ELISPOT to measure the lymphocytes reactivity of patients to TERT, a shared tumor antigen overexpressed in
RCC (19, 27). At baseline, 11 of 23 patients' PBMCs (47.8%)
demonstrated a spontaneous anti-TERT Th1 response and this
frequency was increased to 17 of 23 patients (73.9%) 2 months
after the beginning of treatment, suggesting the de novo activation
of anti-TERT Th1 cells in 6 patients (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we
showed that the magnitude of this response was generally higher
after treatment (42 vs. 105 anti-TERT IFNg spots/105 cells, P ¼
0.01; Fig. 3B). Thus, everolimus treatment favored a higher tumorspeciﬁc Th1 immunity.
We further assessed whether the respective subpopulations
of na€ve (TNAIVE: CD8þCD45ROCD62LþCD127þ), central
(TCM: CD8þCD45ROþCD62LþCD127þ) or effector memory
(TEM: CD8þCD45ROþCD62LCD127þ) CD8 T cells were also
impacted by everolimus treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). No
signiﬁcant modulation was observed prior and after treatment
(Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of the transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes), a key driver of memory
T-cell differentiation (28), in CD8 T cells prior and after treatment.
As depicted in Fig. 3D, after a long-term everolimus exposure
(> 6 months), a higher percentage of EomesþCD8þ T cells was
detected in patients. Although no modulation of CD8þ
CD45ROþ/CD8þCD45RO ratio was observed (Fig 3E), the
CD8þCD45ROþ/Tregs ratio signiﬁcantly decreased after treatment
(Fig. 3F), suggesting a negative impact of Tregs induced following
everolimus treatment on memory CD8 T cells.
Inﬂuence of immune modulation on everolimus efﬁcacy in
mRCC patients
We next addressed the effect of this immune modulation on
everolimus clinical efﬁcacy. At the time of this analysis, treatment
was ongoing for 3 patients, 1 stopped for toxicity reasons and
19 patients had disease progression. At the time of disease

increase of circulating Tregs (Fig. 4A). This was associated with a
loss of the anti-TERT Th1 responses (10/13; Fig. 4B). Accordingly,
the anti-TERT Th1/Tregs ratio signiﬁcantly decreased when disease
progressed under everolimus treatment (Fig. 4C). The antiviral

Immune-Mediated Antitumor Efﬁcacy of Rapalogs

anti-TERT Th1 variation was insigniﬁcant (n ¼ 11). In the third
group (Dneg), the Tregs values of all patients (n ¼ 4) decreased,
whereas the anti-TERT Th1 values greatly increased. The patients
belonging to the group 3 showed a longer progression-free
survival (PFS; 13.2 months) than in the others groups (4.1 and
8 months for group 1 and group 2, respectively, P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 4G).
However, this early immune modulation had no signiﬁcant
impact on overall survival (not shown). Similar results were
observed when immune parameters were calculated by taking
into account the possible ﬂuctuations in the total lymphocytes
count into a distribution in two instead of three groups (Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar observations supporting these results
were noticed in patients with neuroendocrine tumors treated with
everolimus, in whom the survival correlated with a Tregs/anti-TERT
Th1 modulation (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Likewise, when focusing on CD8þ T cells, an increase of
memory CD8þ T cells was observed in mRCC patients belonging to the group 3 (where Tregs decreased early after treatment)
as compared with the two other groups (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Thus, a shift toward Tregs decrease and high expansion
of antitumor Th1 immunity improves the everolimus treatment
effectiveness.
T-cell subsets depletion differentially shapes the antitumor
effect of rapalogs in vivo
To analyze more extensively the role of T cells during rapalogs treatment, we performed in vivo T-cell depletion experiments in B16-OVA–bearing mice treated with rapalogs. We
showed that CD8 T-cell depletion signiﬁcantly reduced the
antitumor efﬁcacy of temsirolimus or everolimus against
B16-OVA (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A). In contrast to CD8 depletion, a
strong inhibition of B16-OVA growth was observed in mice
lacking CD4 T cells before rapalogs administration (P <
0.001; Fig. 5B). Furthermore, a loss of rapamycin or temsirolimus efﬁcacy was showed in B16-OVA–bearing mice when
both T-cell subsets were removed together (Supplementary Fig
S6). Similar experiments were also performed in renal carcinoma RENCA and mammary carcinoma 4T1 models. However,
the depletion of T cells in these models had a low impact on
treatment efﬁcacy (Supplementary Fig. S6). The results in B16OVA model supposed a deleterious effect of CD4 T cells
especially Tregs during rapalogs treatment. So we assessed
whether these drugs could promote Tregs expansion in B16OVA–bearing mice. An early decrease of blood Tregs levels was
observed in half rapalog-treated mice corresponding to what
was observed in patients (Fig. 5C). However, a nonsigniﬁcant
increase of Tregs in spleen and tumor was observed (Fig. 5D). As
tumor growth naturally induces Tregs, we estimated the Tregs
/tumor size ratio and showed that this ratio was highly
increased in mice after treatment, both in tumor and spleen
(Fig. 5E). Thus, like in human, rapalogs treatment promotes
Tregs induction in tumor-bearing mice.
The presence of Tregs in vivo altered the efﬁcacy of rapalogs via
the inhibition of antitumor T-cell immunity
To study the role exerted by Tregs during rapalogs treatment in
the B16-OVA tumor model, we used DEREG mice, which allow
to selectively deplete Tregs after injection of diphtheria toxin
(Fig. 6A). A strong tumor regression occurred in mice treated
with temsirolimus followed by diphtheria toxin injection. This
regression occurred at day 30, corresponding to Tregs elimina-

tion in vivo 5 days after toxin injection (Fig. 6B and C). This
temporary Tregs depletion signiﬁcantly increased the survival of
mice treated with temsirolimus as compared with control mice
(Fig. 6D).
Furthermore, we showed that Tregs ablation during temsirolimus treatment induced a higher expansion of functional antiOVA CD8 T cells in the spleen and the tumor (Fig. 6E and F). This
was also associated with the stimulation of potent IFNg-producing anti-OVA CD4 T cells in mice (Fig. 6G–I). These results suggest
that the rapalogs-induced Tregs abrogate antitumor T-cell functions in vivo. Accordingly, we evaluated in vivo the combination of
rapalogs with therapeutic agents that deplete Tregs or block their
suppressive functions (29). First, we showed that the anti-CD25
mAb (clone PC61.5; ref. 30) used to deplete Tregs in B16-OVA–
bearing mice prior to everolimus treatment induced a stronger
inhibition of tumor growth than everolimus alone (Fig. 7A and
B). Because high level of CCR4 expression was found on rapalogsexposed Tregs (Fig. 2G), we next combined temsirolimus with
CCR4 antagonist, a competitive class of Treg inhibitor (25). As
depicted in Fig. 7C and D, this association efﬁciently delayed the
B16-OVA growth and increased mice survival. Furthermore, mice
treated with the temsirolimus plus CCR4 antagonist showed a
signiﬁcant decrease of Tregs associated with a high number of antiOVA CD8 T cells within the TILs (Fig. 7E and F). Altogether, these
results highlighted the interest to combine Tregs inhibition with
anticancer rapalogs.

Discussion
The rapalogs everolimus and temsirolimus are two mTOR
inhibitors approved as antiproliferative drugs in several cancers
such as RCC (4, 5). On the basis of the critical role of mTOR on Tcell activation, the same drugs are also used in organ transplantation as immune suppressor agents (31). In this study, we
reported that anticancer rapalogs induce striking modulation of
host antitumor T-cell immunity, which in turn shapes the treatment efﬁcacy.
We showed that everolimus promotes an expansion of FoxP3þ
Tregs in mRCC patients. This Tregs increase started mostly 2 months
after the beginning of treatment and remained high in most
patients. Tregs induced after everolimus were Heliosþ, suggesting
that they arise from the nTreg pool and proliferated in vivo
according to the Ki67 expression (26, 32). Furthermore, everolimus exposure strongly increases patients' Tregs suppressive
functions. Indeed, rapalogs-exposed Tregs highly suppress allogenic T-cell proliferation and Th1 cytokines production in vitro.
Although the precise mechanism of suppression required future
investigations, rapalogs-exposed Tregs preferentially exerted a cellcontact immunosuppression as also described for nTregs (26).
Very few studies have investigated the modulation and function
of Tregs in cancer patients treated with rapalogs. A preliminary
study reported a signiﬁcant increase of FoxP3þ Tregs in 7 mRCC
patients treated with temsirolimus (33). One previous study did
not ﬁnd any modulation of Tregs after rapalog treatment but Tregs
were monitored only once at 1 month after the beginning of
treatment (34). However, an increase of Tregs was also reported in
prostate cancer patients treated with everolimus (35). Thus, like in
organ transplantation, mTOR inhibition increases Tregs number
and their suppressive functions in cancer patients (12, 36).
The antitumor CD4 Th1 immunity was concurrently explored
in mRCC patients. To this end, we tested the reactivity of patients'

be related to the ability of mTOR inhibition to promote

autophagy (37). Autophagy has been shown to be critical for the
antitumor immune response elicited by dying tumor cells (38). In
addition, this process improves antigen processing by MHC class
II molecules (39, 40). These results also support our previous
observation in one mRCC patient treated with everolimus that
presented an ampliﬁcation of antitumor Th1 cells followed by
Tregs induction (19). Furthermore, mTOR inhibition has been
shown to increase both the quantity and quality of memory T-cell
responses (14–16).
An important issue of this study is a potential correlation
between patients' survival (PFS) and immune modulation
observed after everolimus treatment. At the time of disease
progression under everolimus treatment, the majority of patients
totally lost the anti-TERT Th1 response in favor to a marked
increase of Tregs. Accordingly, we observed a high decrease of
CD8þCD45ROþ/Tregs and Th1/Tregs ratio at the same time. A
mathematical model based on the early variation of both Tregs
and anti-TERT Th1 cells was used to study the relationship
between immune modulation and patient's clinical outcome.
Our results suggested that an early establishment of a good
immune environment toward the decrease of Tregs and the
increase of antitumor Th1 immunity may enhance everolimus
clinical efﬁcacy. However, due to the small number of patients
enrolled in this study, our hypothesis deserves further conﬁrmation in a larger cohort of mRCC patients and in other tumors.

To dissect the role of T cells during rapalogs treatment, we used
various mouse tumor models. Our choice of models was based on
rapalogs indications in renal and breast carcinoma (4, 5, 7) and
their current evaluation in melanoma (41). In contrast with that in
RENCA and 4T1 tumors, we observed that T-cell subsets can
differentially shape the efﬁcacy of rapalogs against B16-OVA
tumor growth. While CD8 T-cell depletion reduces rapalogs
efﬁcacy on B16-OVA tumor growth, we showed that the removal
of CD4 T cells strongly increased the antitumor effect of these
drugs. The discrepancy in these tumor models may be related to
the difference in the genetic background of the mice. In this regard,
RENCA and 4T1 grow in Balb/c mice, a genetic background
commonly known to develop a weaker Th1 response than
C57BL/6 (42). Furthermore, B16-OVA was previously used in
several studies to evaluate the immune responses after mTOR
inhibition (43–45).
Because CD4 T-cell depletion increases rapalogs efﬁcacy, we
focused our attention on the role of Tregsin vivo. Like in patients,
we showed that everolimus or temsirolimus induced Tregs
expansion in mice and temporary depletion of these cells
during rapalogs treatment in DEREG mice drastically increased
treatment efﬁcacy. Interestingly, Tregs ablation during rapalogs
treatment promotes high expansion of both anti-OVA CD8 and
CD4 T cells within the tumor supporting an inhibitory effect of
rapalogs-exposed Tregs on antitumor T cells in vivo. Similar data

Immune-Mediated Antitumor Efﬁcacy of Rapalogs

have recently reported by Wang and colleagues, using a RENCA
expressing CA9 as tumor antigen in Balb/C mice (46). These
observations led us to combine rapalogs with strategies that
block Treg cells in vivo (29). Then we found that rapalogs efﬁcacy
was highly improved by combining with an antagonist of
CCR4, a CCL17 and CCL22 chemokines receptor (47) highly
expressed on rapalog-exposed Tregs. This association also promotes a high expansion of anti-OVA CD8þ TILs.
In conclusion, this study clearly indicates that anticancer rapalogs shape the host antitumor T-cell immunity and thereby affect
patients' clinical outcome. Because RCC is an immunogenic
tumor and is known to respond to immunotherapies (48, 49),
we believed that there is strong rational to combine rapalogs with
Tregs or immune checkpoint blockade to shift host immune
responses toward protective antitumor immunity.
