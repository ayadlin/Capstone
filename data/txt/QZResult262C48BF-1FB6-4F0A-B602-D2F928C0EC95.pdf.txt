Abstract
The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I, which adds a2-6–linked
sialic acids to substrate glycoproteins, has been implicated in
carcinogenesis; however, the nature of its pathogenic role
remains poorly understood. Here we show that ST6Gal-I is
upregulated in ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas, enriched in
metastatic tumors, and associated with reduced patient survival. Notably, ST6Gal-I upregulation in cancer cells conferred
hallmark cancer stem-like cell (CSC) characteristics. Modulating ST6Gal-I expression in pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells
directly altered CSC spheroid growth, and clonal variants with
high ST6Gal-I activity preferentially survived in CSC culture.
Primary ovarian cancer cells from patient ascites or solid
tumors sorted for a2-6 sialylation grew as spheroids, while
cells lacking a2-6 sialylation remained as single cells and lost

Introduction
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a subset of cancer cells endowed
with the potential to initiate and recapitulate the original
tumor. Intensive research is focused on the molecular identity
of these cells; however, studies of the CSC glycome are limited.
One predominant glycan structure enriched in both cancer and
stem cells is the a2-6 sialic acid linkage (1, 2). The b-galactoside a2-6 sialyltransferase 1, ST6Gal-I, is the primary enzyme
responsible for a2-6 sialylation of N-glycans on select glyco1

and enabled the formation of stably resistant colonies. Gemcitabine treatment of patient-derived xenograft tumors
enriched for ST6Gal-I–expressing cells relative to pair-matched
untreated tumors. ST6Gal-I also augmented tumor-initiating
potential. In limiting dilution assays, subcutaneous tumor
formation was inhibited by ST6Gal-I knockdown, whereas in
a chemically induced tumor initiation model, mice with conditional ST6Gal-I overexpression exhibited enhanced tumorigenesis. Finally, we found that ST6Gal-I induced expression of
the key tumor-promoting transcription factors, Sox9 and Slug.
Collectively, this work highlighted a previously unrecognized
role for a speciﬁc glycosyltransferase in driving a CSC state.

proteins (3), and its activity modulates cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and survival (reviewed in refs. 4, 5). As
examples, ST6Gal-I–mediated a2-6 sialylation of the b1 integrin receptor promotes tumor cell migration and invasion
(6–8), whereas a2-6 sialylation of the Fas and TNFR1 death
receptors blocks apoptosis (9, 10). EGFR is another ST6Gal-I
substrate, and a2-6 sialylation of EGFR impedes cell death
induced by the targeted therapeutic, geﬁtinib (11). ST6Gal-I
activity also inhibits cell death induced by cisplatin (12),
radiation (13), and galectins (14–16), highlighting the multiplicity of pathways through which ST6Gal-I serves as a tumor
cell survival factor.
Increased ST6Gal-I mRNA in tumors is well-documented
(reviewed in refs. 17, 18); however, few studies have evaluated
ST6Gal-I protein in malignant or normal tissues. Previously, we
reported that ST6Gal-I protein was highly expressed in colon
carcinomas, but largely absent from the normal differentiated
colonic epithelium (19). Unexpectedly, a subset of ST6Gal-I–
expressing cells was found within the base of colon crypts and
basal epidermal layer, two known stem cell niches. As well,
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells displayed a profound upregulation in ST6Gal-I relative to the ﬁbroblasts from which they
were derived (2, 19–21), hinting that ST6Gal-I may have some
stem cell–associated function. In colon cancer cells, ST6Gal-I
expression correlates with two CSC markers, CD133 and aldehyde
dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), and forced ST6Gal-I knockdown
reduces the number of CD133/ALDH1-positive CSCs (19). In a

ST6Gal-I Sialyltransferase Confers a Stem-like Phenotype

microarray analysis, ST6Gal-I was one of the top 39 genes selectively expressed in CD133-positive, versus CD133-negative, colon
CSCs (22).
In the current study, we examined ST6Gal-I expression in
ovarian and pancreatic cancer, and determined the role of
ST6Gal-I in promoting CSC behaviors. ST6Gal-I levels were high
in ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas, but negligible in the
normal differentiated epithelium of these organs, suggesting that
ST6Gal-I induction occurs during neoplastic transformation.
ST6Gal-I activity confers archetypal CSC characteristics including
spheroid growth, chemotherapy resistance, and tumor-initiating
potential. Strikingly, ST6Gal-I regulates the expression of two
stem cell–associated transcription factors, Sox9 and Slug, known
to play crucial roles in cancer initiation as well as maintenance of
normal stem/progenitor pools. These ﬁndings elucidate a novel
mechanistic pathway linking tumor cell glycosylation to the
promotion of a CSC-like state.

Materials and Methods
IHC
Carcinoma tissues and patient ascites ﬂuid were collected with
informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval. Parafﬁn-embedded tissues were incubated with anti-ST6Gal-I antibody (R&D Systems, AF5924; 1–5 mg/mL) for 1 hour at room
temperature using an IHC protocol extensively validated by our
group (19). Developed slides were imaged with a Nikon Eclipse
80i camera and ISCapture software. Quantitative IHC scoring was
conducted under blinded conditions by a pathologist. Survival
curves for the ovarian adenocarcinoma cohort were evaluated by
log-rank test.
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer or 50 mmol/L Tris buffer
containing 1% TritonX supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Cancer tissues were homogenized by
Polytron in Tris/Triton X-100 buffer and protein quantiﬁcation
was performed by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Immunoblots
were probed with antibodies to ST6Gal-I (R&D Systems, AF5924),
Sox-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-0095; Abcam, ab26414; or
Millipore, MABC672), Slug (Cell Signaling Technology, 9585S),
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9654S), b-actin
(Abcam), and b-tubulin (Abcam). Densitometry was performed
with ImageJ software.
Cell culture
BxPC3, MiaPaCa2, SKOV3, and HEK293 cells were purchased
from ATCC. OV4 cells were obtained from Dr. Timothy Eberlein
at Harvard University (Boston, MA), Suit2 cells were from
Dr. Michael A. Hollingsworth at the University of Nebraska
(Omaha, NE), and HD3 cells were from Dr. Eileen Friedman at
SUNY Syracuse (Syracruse, NY). All lines were initially obtained
several years ago; however, upon receipt, the cells were immediately expanded to prepare frozen cell stocks. Cells have been tested
to conﬁrm lack of mycoplasma contamination, and some RNA
sequencing was conducted; however, no additional authentication has been performed. Cells were grown in DMEM/F12 (OV4),
RPMI (SKOV3, BxPC3, Suit2), or DMEM (MiaPaCa2, HEK293)
containing 10% FBS and antibiotic/antimycotic supplements
(Invitrogen). HD3 cells were grown in low-glucose DMEM with
7% FBS and antibiotics. Stable polyclonal lines expressing the

human ST6Gal-I gene (Genecopoeia) or shRNA against ST6Gal-I
(Sigma) were created by lentiviral transduction and puromycin
selection. To verify that manipulation of ST6Gal-I expression
resulted in altered ST6Gal-I activity, stably transduced cells were
stained with the SNA lectin (Vector), which binds a2-6 sialic acid,
and then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (not shown). To monitor
spheroid growth, cells were cultured in ultra-low adherence plates
(Corning) in CSC media (DMEM/F12 or RPMI with 1 N1
supplement, 500 mg/mL insulin, 20 ng/mL EGF, and 10 ng/mL
bFGF, Sigma). Spheroid growth was evaluated by ATP measurement (CellTiter-Glo, Promega). Primary cancer cells were isolated
by centrifugation (ascites) or chemical and enzymatic dissociation [patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors]. Cells were stained
with SNA-FITC (Vector) and sorted by FACS. SNA high and low
populations were plated in CSC conditions, and spheroids
counted from multiple ﬁelds.
Ascites treatment
Fresh ovarian cancer ascites was centrifuged to remove cells. The
remaining soluble fraction was mixed in varying amounts with
serum-free media, and administered to OV4 cells. After 24 hours,
viability was assayed by a crystal violet assay. Three independent
experiments were performed, with each experiment performed in
triplicate.
Chemotherapy treatment
Unless otherwise indicated, gemcitabine (Selleck) treatments
were performed at 100 nmol/L. Acute gemcitabine treatment was
evaluated by examining cleaved caspase-3 at 24 hours. Cell
viability assays were conducted across a range of gemcitabine
dosages and time points using CellTiter-Glo (Promega). Three
independent experiments were performed, with each experiment
performed in triplicate. Treatment in spheroid conditions was
performed for 5 days. Stable resistance was determined by continuous gemcitabine exposure for 10 days. Live/Dead Cell Viability Staining (Invitrogen) was executed according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
PDX tumors
PDX models were maintained as described in ref. 23. Brieﬂy,
resected human pancreatic tumors were implanted into immunocompromised mice. When tumors reached approximately
200 mm3, intraperitoneal injections of saline or gemcitabine
(200 mg/kg) were administered once a week for 6 weeks.
Tumors were harvested and embedded in parafﬁn blocks for
analysis.
Limiting dilution tumor initiation assay
Animal procedures were done with prior approval from
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Cells were grown to 80%–
90% conﬂuency, passaged, and resuspended in serum-free
DMEM and kept on ice until injection. Cells were mixed 1:1
with Matrigel (Corning) and injected subcutaneously into the
ﬂanks of 5- to 6-week-old, female, athymic nude mice (Harlan)
at indicated dilutions (5 mice per group). Mice were evaluated
2 to 3 times per week for tumor formation and subsequent
growth using digital calipers. Tumor volume was determined
using the formula L  (W2)/2.

Analysis of mPanINs
C57BL/6 mice with a conditionally active KrasG12D allele
knocked into the endogenous Kras locus, or with the KrasG12D
mutation combined with a conditionally activated, heterozygous deletion of tp53 (KrasG12D;tp53þ/FL), were crossed
with Pdx1-Cre mice to produce pancreas-speciﬁc expression
or deletion of these factors. Mice were sacriﬁced at 3 months
(Pdx1-Cre;KrasG12D;tp53þ/FL) or 4 months (Pdx1-Cre;
KrasG12D), and pancreata were immunohistochemically stained
for ST6Gal-I.
Rosa26-ST6Gal-I mouse
C57BL/6 mice expressing ST6Gal-I under the Rosa-26 gene
promoter were generated by the UAB Transgenic Mouse
Facility. Brieﬂy, the human ST6Gal-I CDS was ampliﬁed
from a plasmid containing the St6gal1 gene (Origene) and
inserted into pRosa26-DEST (Addgene #21189). Primers used
were:
forward, BY3711: ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggcttaaccATGATTCACACCAACCTGAAG;
reverse, BY3712: ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtaTTAAACCTTATCGTCGTC
The ST6Gal-I targeting vector was electroporated into Primogenix B6 (C57BL/6 N-tac) embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells were
injected into tyrosinase-deﬁcient blastocysts to generate male
chimeras. Germline passage was obtained by crossing chimeric
males to albino C57BL/6 females.
Azoxymethane–dextran sulfate sodium salt
The Rosa26-ST6Gal-I mouse was crossed to a Villin-Cre mouse
[The Jackson Laboratory, B6.Cg-Tg(Vil-cre)997Gum/J] to generate intestinal-speciﬁc ST6Gal-I overexpression on a C57BL/6
background. Eight Rosa-ST6þ Creþ and eight Rosa-ST6þ Cre
littermate control mice were evaluated by the azoxymethane–
dextran sulfate sodium salt (AOM-DSS) chemical carcinogenesis
model as described in ref. 24. AOM was injected intraperitoneally
(10 mg/kg body weight) and after one week, 2% DSS was added to
the drinking water for 1 week. At 10 weeks, colons were evaluated
for tumor formation. Tumor area was analyzed using ImageJ
software.
ST6Gal-I adenovirus
HEK293T cells were transduced with ST6Gal-I–expressing adenovirus (Applied Biological Materials) for 6 hours at multiplicity
of infections of 100 and 1,000. Cells were lysed after 48 hours and
immunoblotted.

Results
ST6Gal-I is upregulated in ovarian carcinoma and correlates
with decreased patient survival
Immunohistochemical analyses of normal human ovary
revealed minimal ST6Gal-I expression in epithelium and
stroma (Fig. 1A), although a subset of inclusion cysts
expressed ST6Gal-I (not shown). In contrast, 34 of 35 ovarian
serous adenocarcinomas (98%) were positive for ST6Gal-I.
ST6Gal-I was present in tumor cells (Fig. 1B, arrow), but not
adjacent normal-appearing epithelium (arrowhead), and
staining was heterogeneous, reﬂecting ST6Gal-I upregulation
in speciﬁc tumor cell subpopulations. ST6Gal-I was also
detected in immune cells within the tumor stroma (not

3980 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

shown), consistent with the known expression of ST6Gal-I
in immune cells. Interestingly, we ﬁnd a subset of ST6Gal-I–
expressing cells within the normal fallopian tube (Fig. 1C), a
suggested stem cell reservoir, and putative-initiating site for
ovarian cancer.
Accompanying survival data for patients in the ovarian serous
adenocarcinoma cohort allowed a correlative analysis of ST6Gal-I
IHC expression with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS). Patients bearing tumors with high ST6Gal-I levels
had signiﬁcantly shortened survival by both measures (Fig. 1D
and E).
ST6Gal-I is upregulated in pancreatic cancer
We next evaluated a second organ, the normal and malignant pancreas, for ST6Gal-I expression by IHC. ST6Gal-I
levels were minimal in normal acinar cells (Fig. 1F, star),
and most ductal cells (Fig. 1F arrow), although a subset of the
larger ducts was ST6Gal-I–positive (not shown). Some endocrine cells within the normal pancreatic islets expressed
ST6Gal-I (Fig. 1F, arrowhead), the function of which is
unknown. In a cohort of epithelial pancreatic malignancies,
including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ST6Gal-I
was expressed in 14 of 21 tumors (Fig. 1G). ST6Gal-I was
also observed in areas of chronic pancreatitis within tumors
(not shown). Tissue was then obtained from 20 distinct
pancreatic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. IHC
revealed that 15 of 20 PDX tumors expressed ST6Gal-I (Fig.
1H). The primary pancreatic cancer cases, combined with
PDX tumors, demonstrate 29 of 41 (71%) tumors positive
for ST6Gal-I.
ST6Gal-I expression is enriched in metastatic tumors
To determine potential differences in ST6Gal-I expression as
a result of metastasis, we examined 9 primary, and 10 metastatic, unmatched ovarian tumors. While ST6Gal-I was found in
all tumor lysates by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A, see long blot
exposure; densitometry shown in Fig. 2B), metastatic lysates
showed a clear increase in ST6Gal-I (Fig. 2C; densitometry
shown in Fig. 2D). Both full-length ST6Gal-I (50 kDa) and
an approximately 37 kDa known cleaved form (25) were
detected. ST6Gal-I is cleaved by proteases including the BACE1
secretase (25). Consistent with other studies (19 and unpublished data), the cleaved ST6Gal-I isoform seems to be more
abundant in tumor tissues compared with cultured cell lines,
perhaps because of the proteolytic nature of the tumor
microenvironment.
Sufﬁcient tissue from the cohort described above was
available for IHC analysis of all 9 primary, and 8 of 10
metastatic, tumors (representative images, Fig. 2E and F). The
average percentage of the tumor positive for ST6Gal-I was
60% in the primary cases and 80% in the metastases (Fig.
2G). The data was further segregated to group tumors that
had 0%–33%, 33%–66%, or 66%–100% ST6Gal-I–positive
cells (Fig. 2H). Primary tumors were distributed across the
categories, whereas 7 of 8 metastatic tumors had >66%
ST6Gal-I–positive tumor cells. We also examined ST6Gal-I
expression by IHC in 13 matched primary and metastatic
ovarian tumors. Of these, 8 pairs had elevated ST6Gal-I
expression in the metastases, 4 pairs had higher expression
in the primary tumor, and 1 pair was unchanged. Together,

these results suggest that ST6Gal-I is elevated in the majority
of metastatic cases.
ST6Gal-I contributes to spheroid growth
To interrogate the function of ST6Gal-I in CSC behavior,
ST6Gal-I was stably knocked down in the MiaPaCa2 and BxPC3
pancreatic cancer lines, and cells were evaluated for spheroid
growth. Empty vector control (EV) or ST6Gal-I-knockdown
(ST6-KD) cells were grown for 2 weeks in CSC culture (nonadherent growth in serum-free media). As shown in Fig. 3A and B,
cell viability in spheroid conditions was decreased in ST6-KD
cells. To conﬁrm results in ovarian cancer cells, spheroid growth
was monitored in the SKOV3 ovarian line. SKOV3 cells have
relatively modest endogenous ST6Gal-I, therefore, ST6Gal-I was
both stably knockeddown (ST6-KD) and overexpressed (ST6OE), in this line. Viability in spheroid culture was diminished
in ST6-KD cells, but enhanced in ST6-OE cells (Fig. 3C).

www.aacrjournals.org

Spheroid culture selects for ST6Gal-I–expressing clones
Spheroid culture is an established method for isolating CSCs;
we thus hypothesized these conditions would select for subclones with high ST6Gal-I expression. SKOV3 cells were placed
into standard, or CSC, culture for 1 week and ST6Gal-I expression was quantiﬁed in the surviving population. Higher
ST6Gal-I levels were observed in EV cells grown in CSC conditions versus growth in FBS-containing media (Fig. 3D).
Signiﬁcantly, ST6-OE and ST6-KD cells also exhibited enrichment in ST6Gal-I after placement in CSC culture (Fig. 3D).
These cell lines are pooled polyclonal populations, and both
the shRNA and ST6Gal-I expression constructs are driven by
constitutive promoters. Hence, increased ST6Gal-I levels in CSC
spheroids likely result from selective survival of clones with
high ST6Gal-I expression rather than transcriptional upregulation of the gene. In addition, ST6Gal-I expression was examined
at varying time points in MiaPaCa-2 and SKOV3 cells after

as a function of increasing time (Fig. 3E and F).
Primary ovarian cancer cells sorted for ST6Gal-I activity
selectively survive in spheroid culture
Tumor cell–rich ascites ﬂuid was obtained from 3 ovarian cancer
patients and the harvested cells were stained for ST6Gal-I. ST6Gal-I
was expressed in the tumor spheroids of all 3 patients (representative image, Fig. 3G). We then sorted fresh ascites cells by FACS
using the SNA lectin, which detects a2-6 sialic acids added by
ST6Gal-I. SNA-high and SNA-low ascites cells were grown under
CSC culture conditions. SNA-high cells formed spheroids, whereas
SNA-low cells remained as single cells (Fig. 3H and I). The SNAhigh fraction survived in spheroid culture for at least a month,
whereas the SNA-low population showed morphologic signs of
cell death after several days. This experiment was repeated with
tumor cells dissociated from an ovarian cancer PDX tumor with
similar results (Fig. 3J).
ST6Gal-I promotes tumor cell survival within the ascites milieu
Ascites ﬂuid represents a proinﬂammatory microenvironment
that metastatic cells must navigate to seed tumors at distant sites.

3982 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

To test whether ST6Gal-I contributes to tumor cell survival within
ascites, the cytokine-rich soluble fraction of ascites was collected
(after removal of patient cells) and incubated with OV4 ovarian
cancer cells, which either lack ST6Gal-I (EV) or in which
ST6Gal-I was stably expressed (ST6-OE). After 24 hours, EV
cells exhibited marked cell death in the ascites microenvironment while ST6-OE cells were completely protected (Fig. 3K).
The graph depicts averages from three independent experiments using ascites from 3 distinct ovarian cancer patients,
demonstrating that ST6Gal-I consistently protects against ascites-induced cell death despite potential patient-speciﬁc differences in ascites composition.
ST6Gal-I confers resistance to gemcitabine
Inherent chemoresistance is another known CSC characteristic; we therefore tested whether ST6Gal-I protects against
gemcitabine, a ﬁrst-line treatment for pancreatic cancer. Compared with MiaPaCa2 EV cells, ST6-KD cells were sensitized
to gemcitabine-induced cell death, evidenced by increased
caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 4A). We next examined the viability
of cells exposed to gemcitabine across a range of dosages and
time points. At one day after gemcitabine treatment, no

major differences were noted in dose response (not shown).
However, at 3 and 5 days after gemcitabine treatment, KD
cells exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced survival compared with
EV cells (Fig. 4B). Response to gemcitabine was also examined in MiaPaCa2 spheroids, given that spheroids may better
recapitulate the in vivo tumor response to chemotherapy
than adherent cultures. As shown in Fig. 4C, untreated
EV cells exhibited more robust spheroid growth than untreated ST6-KD cells (consistent with results in Fig. 3A). However,
signiﬁcantly greater gemcitabine-induced cell death was
observed in ST6-KD cells after normalizing to the untreated
controls; 57% cell death was measured for ST6-KD cells and
30% for EV cells (P < 0.05). To assess ST6Gal-I involvement
in stable gemcitabine resistance, pancreatic cancer cells were
exposed to prolonged, high-dose gemcitabine (Fig. 4D). For
both BxPC3 and MiaPaCa2 lines, no apparent viable colonies
were noted in the gemcitabine-treated ST6-KD populations.
Conversely, many viable colonies, measured by Live/Dead
staining, were observed in the EV cultures.

ST6Gal-I expression is enriched in gemcitabine-treated
pancreatic PDX tumors
To evaluate ST6Gal-I's role in response to gemcitabine treatment in vivo, pancreatic PDX tumors were harvested from mice
treated with or without gemcitabine, and immunostained for
ST6Gal-I. We hypothesized that in heterogeneous tumor specimens, gemcitabine treatment would enrich for ST6Gal-I–expressing cells due to a survival advantage conferred by ST6Gal-I.
Tumors exposed to Gem in vivo had increased ST6Gal-I levels
relative to pair-matched na€ve tumors in 5 of 6 cases analyzed
(representative pair in Fig. 4E). In the single pair that did not show
enrichment, ST6Gal-I was not detected in either control (saline) or
gemcitabine-treated tumors. These data, combined with in vitro
studies of gemcitabine-induced tumor cell death, suggest that
ST6Gal-I contributes to a chemoresistant phenotype.
Tumor-initiating potential is enhanced by ST6Gal-I activity
To examine pancreatic tumor initiation, limiting dilution
assays were conducted. EV or ST6-KD MiaPaCa2 cells were

injected subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice at
increasing dilutions and tumor incidence and growth were measured (Fig. 5A–C). Tumors formed in all mice of both the EV and
ST6-KD groups when 106 cells were injected. However, after
injection with 105 cells, 5 of 5 mice in the EV group formed
tumors compared with 3 of 5 mice in theST6-KD group. ST6-KD–
derived tumors were smaller in size, and tumors from the ST6-KD
group took approximately 1 week longer to be detectable (Fig.
5B). In addition, two mice in the EV group, but none in the ST6KD group, had lymph node metastases. After injection of 104 cells,
tumors formed in 3 of 5 mice in the EV group compared with 2 of
5 mice in the ST6-KD group (Fig. 5C).

invasive pancreatic intraepithelial lesions (PanIN), the precursor to PDAC. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that
ST6Gal-I was expressed in the mPanINs from Pdx1-Cre;KrasG12D
mice (Fig. 5D). In addition, a second, more aggressive pancreatic cancer model with only a single copy of the tumor suppressor tp53 in addition to KrasG12D (28) was examined. mPanINs from this second model also expressed ST6Gal-I (not
shown). In both models, ST6Gal-I expression was noted in
ductal-like cells undergoing acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM;
not shown), a process thought to precipitate PanIN formation
(29). In contrast, ST6Gal-I expression was only apparent in the
islets of normal murine pancreata (Fig. 5E).

ST6Gal-I is upregulated in PanINs formed in genetically
engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer
Consistent with a tumor-initiating function, it was anticipated that ST6Gal-I would be upregulated early in the neoplastic process. Human pancreatic cancer is thought to be
initiated by activating mutations in the KRAS2 gene, present
in >90% of advanced pancreatic cancers (26). To model this
disease in mice, a mutated variant, KrasG12D, is introduced in
the pancreas by Cre-recombinase expressed under a pancreatic
promoter Pdx (27). The Pdx1-Cre;KrasG12D mice develop preinvasive lesions (mPanIN) that closely resemble human pre-

Chemically induced carcinogenesis is potentiated in ST6Gal-I

ST6Gal-I with a ﬂoxed stop codon was engineered into the Rosa26
locus (Rosa-ST6Gal-I) and crossed to mice with Cre-recombinase
expressed under the intestinal Villin promoter (Fig. 5F). AOMDSS–induced colon carcinogenesis (Fig. 5G) was examined in 8

transgene developed tumors in 8 of 8 cases, whereas only 5 of 8 of
the litter-matched controls formed tumors. The total area of
tumor tissue (Fig. 5H), as well as number of tumors per colon
(Fig. 5I), were signiﬁcantly greater in ST6Gal-I transgenic mice.
ST6Gal-I regulates the expression of stem cell transcription
factors Sox9 and Slug
Recent landmark studies suggest that de novo expression of the
stem cell transcription factor, Sox9, in pancreatic acinar cells is the
key initiating event in PDAC (29). Accordingly, MiaPaCa2 and
BxPC3 pancreatic cells were immunoblotted for Sox9. As shown
in Fig. 6A and B, ST6Gal-I knockdown reduced the levels of Sox9.
Similarly, Sox9 expression was repressed by ST6Gal-I knockdown
in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells, and HD3 colon cancer cells
(Fig. 6C and D). Contrarily, forced expression of ST6Gal-I in OV4
ovarian cancer cells induced Sox9 expression (Fig. 6E). Suit2
pancreatic cancer cells were transduced with increasing amounts
of lentivirus to produce populations with variant ST6Gal-I expression. In these lines, Sox9 protein increased in a dose-dependent
manner in correspondence with ST6Gal-I levels (Fig. 6F). To
evaluate ST6Gal-I regulation of Sox9 by an alternative method,
HEK293 cells were transiently transduced with adenovirus to
express ST6Gal-I. A marked increase in Sox9 was detected 48
hours after transduction (Fig. 6G). Evidence suggests Sox9 acts in
conjunction with the Slug (SNAI2) transcription factor to induce
stemness (30), therefore, we evaluated Slug expression in these
lines. ST6Gal-I was found to regulate Slug in ovarian, but not
pancreatic, cancer cells (Fig. 6H and I). The ﬁnding that ST6Gal-I
regulates expression of critical transcription factors such as Sox9
and Slug establishes a new role for cellular glycans in promoting
stem-like cell properties.

Discussion
Aberrant surface glycosylation was one of the earliest identiﬁed hallmarks of a tumor cell; however, the functional role of
speciﬁc glycosyltransferases in carcinogenesis remains unclear.
Herein, we show that ST6Gal-I is highly expressed in the

A

majority of ovarian and pancreatic cancers, whereas levels are
very low in the differentiated epithelium of these organs.
Combined with similar observations in the colon (19), these
results suggest ST6Gal-I upregulation is a common event in
epithelial transformation (although notably, some specialized
epithelia, such as the Brunner glands and hepatocytes, express
substantial ST6Gal-I, data not shown). Supporting this concept,
ST6Gal-I expression is induced in the early neoplastic lesions,
mPanINs, that develop in two murine models of pancreatic
carcinogenesis. In serous adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent
and deadly subtype of ovarian cancer, ST6Gal-I expression
correlates with decreased progression-free and overall patient
survival, and is enriched in mestastases. Others have determined that tumor cell a2-6 sialylation promotes metastasis in
animal models (31, 32), and in vitro studies point to a role for
ST6Gal-I in cell invasiveness (33–35). ST6Gal-I also facilitates
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an intermediate
step in metastasis (36).
A prior, unanticipated ﬁnding was that ST6Gal-I expression in
normal tissues is high in stem cell niches but not adjacent
differentiated epithelia, suggesting that ST6Gal-I expression is
repressed as cells transition away from the stem/progenitor compartment (19). Conversely, reversion of differentiated cells to a
stem cell state by forced expression of pluripotency-inducing
factors (Sox-2, Oct-4, Klf-4, and c-Myc) causes a dramatic induction of ST6Gal-I (2, 19, 20). In the polyoma middle T antigen
breast cancer model, tumors arising in ST6Gal-I–null mice were
more differentiated than those in wild-type mice (37). Similarly,
ST6Gal-I expression was inversely correlated with the level of
differentiation in human colon tumors (38). The upstream mediators that control the dynamic expression of ST6Gal-I during cell
differentiation or transformation are not well-deﬁned, although
oncogenic ras is known to stimulate ST6Gal-I expression (39, 40).
ST6Gal-I expression is induced by the master stem cell transcription factor, Sox2, as well (41).
In view of the putative association between ST6Gal-I, stem/
progenitor cells, and CSC markers (19), we hypothesized that
ST6Gal-I is a molecular driver of CSC behaviors. Using cell models

ST6Gal-I Sialyltransferase Confers a Stem-like Phenotype

with forced ST6Gal-I overexpression or knockdown, we show
ST6Gal-I regulates spheroid growth and response to gemcitabine.
Moreover, cells with high endogenous ST6Gal-I exhibit a survival
advantage when placed in spheroid culture, or after exposure to
chemotherapy, both well-accepted methods for isolating CSCs
from heterogeneous tumor cell populations. ST6Gal-I enrichment
was also observed in pancreatic PDX tissues harvested from
gemcitabine-treated versus untreated mice, providing in vivo evidence for the selective survival of cells with ST6Gal-I. The survival
advantage conferred by ST6Gal-I extends to primary ovarian
cancer cells isolated from solid tumors or patient ascites ﬂuid.
Ovarian cancer cells sorted for high levels of ST6Gal-I organized
into spheroids and grew for a prolonged interval in CSC culture,
while ST6Gal-I–deﬁcient cells remained as single cells and did not
survive initial seeding. We postulate ST6Gal-I may function to
foster ovarian tumor cell survival within the peritoneal milieu, a
critical event in ovarian cancer metastasis. To address this possibility, the acellular, cytokine-rich, soluble fraction of patient
ascites was incubated with ovarian cancer cell lines lacking
endogenous ST6Gal-I or engineered with ST6Gal-I overexpression. Ascites-induced cell death was observed in cells devoid of
ST6Gal-I, whereas ST6Gal-I–expressing cells were protected.
Our studies further suggest that ST6Gal-I participates in tumor
initiation. In the AOM-DSS chemical carcinogenesis model, transgenic mice with forced ST6Gal-I expression had a greater number
and overall area of colon tumors, relative to control littermates. As
a second tumor initiation model, limiting dilution assays were
conducted with pancreatic cancer cells with or without ST6Gal-I
knockdown. At lower numbers of cells injected, fewer mice in the
ST6-KD group developed tumors compared with controls, and the
tumors that did form from knockdown cells were smaller in size.
As well, some of the mice in the control group, but none in the
ST6-KD group, developed lymph node metastases
Importantly, we ﬁnd ST6Gal-I regulates the expression of a
crucial tumor-initiating factor, Sox9, in pancreatic, ovarian, and
colon cancer cells. Sox9 is a stem cell–associated transcription
factor strongly linked to the formation and growth of many types
of cancer (42). In normal adult tissues, Sox9 is found in the basal
colon crypt stem cell compartment (43), and is essential for
maintaining the pool of pancreatic (44) and breast (45) progenitor cells. Sox9-dependent acinar-to-ductal reprogramming serves
as the principal mechanism for initiation of PanINs and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (29). Sox9 prevents cell senescence

and cooperates with oncogenes such as ras to drive malignancy
(46). Furthermore, Sox9 can act synergistically with the Slug
transcription factor. Guo and colleagues reported that forced
coexpression of Sox9 and Slug was sufﬁcient to convert differentiated mammary cells into mammary stem cells (30). The ﬁnding
that Sox9 and Slug expression are regulated by a speciﬁc glycosyltransferase implicates tumor glycosylation as a mechanism for
functionally shifting cells to a less differentiated, stem-like state.
In the aggregate, these studies highlight a novel function for the
tumor glycome as an active contributor to the CSC phenotype.
