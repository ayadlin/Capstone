ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is associated with poor prognosis due to its resistance to
surgery, irradiation, and conventional chemotherapy. Thus, efficient therapeutic
approaches for the treatment of GBM are urgently needed. HSP70 is an antiapoptotic
protein that participates in the inhibition of both mitochondrial and membrane
receptor apoptosis pathways and is highly expressed in glioma tissues. Here, we
investigated a derivative of apoptin; specifically, a chicken anemia viral protein with
selective toxicity toward cancer cells that can inhibit hyperactive molecules, including
HSP70. Our earlier studies demonstrated that apoptin directly binds to the promoter of
HSP70 and inhibits HSP70 transcription, which contributes to HSP70 downregulation.
This study provides the first demonstration of the therapeutic potential of an apoptinderived peptide for the treatment of GBM by identifying the minimal region of the
apoptin domain required for interaction with the heat-shock element (HSE). This
apoptin-derived peptide (ADP) inhibits glioma cell proliferation and tumor growth
as well as exhibits an increased ability to promote apoptosis in GBM cells compared
with rapamycin and temozolomide. ADP treatment inhibited xenograft tumor growth
and increased the overall health and survival of nude mice implanted with GBM cells.
These effects were measured in tumors obtained from cell lines and were observed
in both intracranial and subcutaneous xenografts. In conclusion, we provide the first
demonstration that ADP has therapeutic potential for the treatment of human GBM.
Specifically, this study suggests that ADP is a potent candidate for drug development
based on its favorable toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles as well as its time- and
cost-saving benefits.

of care, specifically surgical resection followed by
radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) [2]. More recently,
two large randomized phase III trials (AVAglio and
RTOG 0825), which aimed to compare anti-angiogenic
therapy (bevacizumab) with the standard of care, failed
to demonstrate a significant improvement in OS [3–5].
Therefore, developing novel molecular therapies for
GBM is still a considerable obstacle for basic and clinical
medicine .

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common
intracranial malignancy and accounts for approximately
50% of all gliomas [1]. These tumors are characterized
by aggressive invasiveness, long-distance migration, and
neovascularization. GBM is one of the most aggressive
cancers and is associated with a median overall survival
(OS) of approximately 15 months with the standard

The 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) facilitates
the folding, assembly, transport, and degradation of
biological macromolecules. HSP70 inhibits the release
of cytochrome C and thereby prevents procaspase-9 from
forming apoptosis bodies, which are highly expressed in
tumor tissues and weakly expressed in normal tissues [6].
Based on these characteristics, HSP70 is considered a
single-molecule target in tumors. Using clinical samples
of GBM and normal para-cancerous tissues, we found
that HSP70 expression in cancer tissues is significantly
increased compared with that in adjacent tissues,
suggesting that HSP70 is useful for glioma diagnosis and
for pharmaceutical development [7].
We previously reported that apoptin binds to the
molecular chaperone HSP70 and the promoter of HSP70
and inhibits HSP70 transcription [8]. Studies assessing the
interaction between proteins and the nucleate identified
apoptin fragments containing the hydrophobic amino acids
in the leucine-rich stretch (LRS, amino acids 33–46), the
leucine nuclear export sequence (NES), the nuclear import
sequence with the SH3 domain NSL1 (amino acids 82–88),
and specific phosphorylation sites in NSL2 (amino acids
111-121). In addition, we added a TAT sequence on the N
terminus of the peptide to serve as a tag.
Apoptin, a 14-kDa viral protein (chicken anemia
virus protein-3, VP3), can induce apoptosis in cancer
cells without affecting normal cells [9, 10] because
of its cellular localization. When apoptin is located in
the nucleus, it promotes cell death; otherwise, it has no
influence on cell viability [7]. In this study, we found
high expression levels of HSP70, known as the putative
target of apoptin-derived-peptide (ADP), in human GBM
samples and a GBM cell line. We also found that ADP
retains the vast majority of the antitumor-specific target
capabilities of apoptin. In addition, ADP can strongly
inhibit HSP70 transcription in GBM cells and exerts
a stronger effect than apoptin in promoting tumor cell
apoptosis, reducing tumor growth, and improving animal
survival. Thus, our results suggest that the synthetic
apoptin-derived peptide has a better anti-tumor effect on
GBM. Given that HSP70 has a minimal or no expression
in normal cells, ADP appears to be an accurate and ideal
drug because of his biological characteristics and selective
inhibition of HSP70.

results showed that HSP70 expression was significantly
increased in gliomas compared with NBT (Figure 1B).
HSP70 expression in glioma tissues and GBM cells
representing different grades was analyzed by qRT-PCR,
and the results showed that HSP70 expression in glioma
tissues and GBM cells was significantly increased
compared with that in NBT (Figure 1C). We confirmed
that HSP70 was expressed in all GBM cell lines, and
expression variations were noted among the different cell
lines, in accordance with the results obtained for different
GBM samples. Therefore, these two GBM cell lines
represent appropriate models for the study of the antitumoral effects of HSP70 inhibition in GBM.

Design of an apoptin-derived peptide (ADP)
A screening of the domains of the structure shared
between apoptin and the HSE revealed that the induction of
HSP70 inhibits GBM cell death. A previous study conducted
by our laboratory showed that HSP70 is expressed at lower
levels in tumor cells treated with apoptin. Furthermore,
apoptin downregulates HSP70 in tumors by binding directly
to the HSE, which is the promoter of HSP70, and inhibiting
HSP70 expression [11]. Here, we found that both apoptin
and ADP can specifically interact with the SRC homology
3 (SH3) domain on the HSE.
First, we generated several apoptin fragments, which
included the LRS, NES, nuclear sequences that contain the
SH3 domain NSL1, and specific phosphorylation sites in
the NSL2 domain. Our electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA) results indicated that NLS1 and NLS2 strongly
interact with the HSE (data not shown) when equal
amounts of NSL1 and NSL2 are added simultaneously.
NSL1 was found to have a stronger ability to bind to
the HSE. In addition, combination strips with the HSE
increased significantly after NSL1 and NSL2 were added
simultaneously. A combination of NSL1 and NSL2
exhibited stronger binding capacity with the HSE (results
not shown). LRS sequences are rich in hydrophobic amino
acids. Therefore, we designed a peptide that contained the
NLS1 (amino acids 82-88), NLS2 (amino acids 111-121),
and LRS structural domain (amino acids 33-46), which
is rich in hydrophobic amino acids, from apoptin. We
hypothesized that ADP could bind multiple proteins.
In vitro pull-down assays using U87-MG glioma cell
lysates revealed that the ADP polypeptide interacts
with a GST tag. A subsequent electrophoresis analysis
revealed several protein bands (Figure 2B). To further
verify the interaction between the two domains in vivo,
we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to detect
the interaction between ADP and HSP70, and our results
revealed that ADP interacts with HSP70.
To examine the interaction between ADP and HSP70
in vivo, we performed an immunofluorescence analysis to
assess the impact of apoptin on the subcellular location of
HSP70. In U87-MG cells treated with PBS, HSP70 was

the expression of HSP70 in a series of frozen human GBM

glioma cells

evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas
in U87-MG cells treated with ADP, the HSP70 expression
levels were decreased after 6 hours, and the distribution of
HSP70 in the cytoplasm decreased (Figure 2C).

We evaluated the cytotoxic effect of ADP in the
U87-MG and U251-MG GBM cell lines using the MTT
assay. The IC50 (concentration required to inhibit 50%
of cell viability) values were 90 μg/mL for U87-MG
cells and 80 μg/mL for U251-MG cells (Figure 4A).
The proliferation of the cells grown in the absence of
the treatment was considered 100%, and cell survival
was expressed as a normalized average. As shown in
Figure  4A, after treatment with 80 μg/mL apoptinderived peptide for 24 hours, the survival rate of glioma
cells was significantly reduced compared with that of the
control group. This growth rate was also slightly lower
than that observed after apoptin treatment and higher than
that found after rapamycin (RAPA) treatment (32 μM).
Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry was performed to assess
U87-MG and U251-MG cells treated with the TAT-apoptin
derived peptide, and the level of apoptosis was assessed 24
hours later. RAPA (32 μM) was used as a positive control,
and an equal volume of PBS was used as a negative
control (Figure 4B).
The results of the apoptosis analysis, which are
presented in Figure 4B, revealed that TAT-apoptin-

molecular weight of ADP is 5.2 kDa, and its isoelectric
point is 13.18. ADP is hydrophilic, exhibits good solubility,
and can be dissolved in PBS. Schiffer-Edmundson helical
wheel modeling using DNAstar software suggested a
possible amphipathic α-helical conformation (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, 3D prediction models (PHYRE2 server)
(Figure 3C) and Ramachandran plot (UCLA-DOE LAB
server) analyses were performed (Figure 3D). The threedimensional structure of ADP showed an M shapelike structure. The ADP structure domain contains four
parts: a penetrating peptide TAT and the core NLS1,
LRS, and NLS2 sequences. The LRS structure forms a
flexible connection between the two nuclear sequences to
effectively maintain the original independent structure,
and TAT protects the peptide when entering cells.

derived peptides (80 μg/mL) promote apoptosis to a
greater extent than apoptin in glioma cells. Treatment
with ADP for 24 hours resulted in the highest apoptosis
level. These results further confirmed that the apoptinderived peptide, through its interaction with the HSE
domain, mediates glioma cell apoptosis. Notably,
compared with apoptin, apoptin-derived peptides
increased apoptosis in human astrocytes, but the extent
of apoptosis remained low compared with that in glioma
cells. Thus, we cannot rule out that the apoptin-derived
peptide-specific induction of apoptosis does not affect
normal cells.
To further analyze the mechanism through which
apoptin-derived peptides promote apoptosis in glioma
cells and inhibit growth, we performed Hoechst 33342
nuclear staining (Figure 4C). Our results indicate that
the cell nuclei in the control group appeared normal,
whereas in the apoptin group, glioma nuclei were
hyperchromatic, and chromatin was highly condensed
and marginalized. In addition, some parts of the nuclei
were fragmented, which is indicative of apoptosis. In the

apoptin-derived peptide group, the majority of cells were
fragmented, and apoptosis was significantly enhanced.
The effects of RAPA treatment were similar to those
obtained with the treatment with the apoptin-derived
peptide. Our results suggest that ADP efficiently induces
apoptosis in GBM.
Electron microscopy of identical tumors showed
large amounts of cell debris and liquid droplets scattered
within the visual field (Figure 4D). Blurring between
edema in the tissue and liquid on the tumor edges is
obtained. The amount of cell debris was markedly reduced
in cells treated with ADP. Electron microscopy revealed
filaments that formed structures mirroring that of other
cells to maintain the cell shapes. Between the filaments
were small fragments of cell debris. (Figure 4D-4). Actin
and intermediate filaments were indicated by structures
7 to 10 nm in thickness. Thus, we discovered that the
cytoskeleton of tumor cells presented characteristic
changes after ADP administration, which was coincident
with shriveling of tumor tissues and mitochondrial
autophagy (Figures 4D-5, 6).

ADP induces glioma cell apoptosis by reducing
HSP70 expression

significantly change in 293 cells, indicating that ADP
specifically induces apoptosis in tumor cells.

Apoptin induced apoptosis in cancer cells by
activating caspases via the intrinsic/mitochondrial death
pathway instead of the extrinsic/receptor-based pathway
[12]. To further confirm the characteristics of ADPinduced glioma cell death, we compared the nuclear
morphology of apoptin/ADP-untreated and apoptin/
ADP-treated 293 and U87-MG cells by analyzing the
apoptotic nuclei. In addition, we hypothesized that ADP
induces apoptosis in glioma cells by reducing HSP70
expression, a key target of cell survival. The results of
the Western blotting and immunocytochemistry indicated
that HSP70 was expressed (Figure 5A and 5C). In these
experiments, the apoptin treatment group showed obvious
apoptotic nuclear morphology, indicating that apoptin has
a strong ability to induce U-87 cell apoptosis (Figure 5A
and 5C). Our results showed that after ADP treatment,
HSP70 expression decreased in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 5B). In addition, we added an equal amount
of ADP to 293 cells and assessed HSP70 expression.
Our results demonstrated that the HSP70 levels did not

tumor cells
To investigate the role of HSP70 in ADP-induced
apoptosis in tumor cells, we constructed the HSP70
overexpression plasmid pcDNA3.1-HSP70. After we
transfected the plasmid into U87-MG cells. We then
employed AO/EB staining to detect ADP-induced
apoptosis in U87-MG cells with modulated HSP70
expression levels. Our results indicated that the high levels
of HSP70 expression strongly inhibited the proapoptotic
effect of ADP. The number of apoptotic cells was decreased
remarkably, and the vast majority of cells exhibited a
healthy morphology. In contrast, in cells treated with ADP,
most of the nuclei were stained an orange-red color, which
is indicative of nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation in
late apoptotic or dead cells (Figure 6A). We subsequently
performed Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining and a flow
cytometry analysis of apoptosis. The results revealed that
19.3% of ADP-treated U87-MG cells underwent apoptosis

the mice were randomly divided into the control group, the
apoptin-derived peptide group, and the RAPA group. The
tumor volume in all tumor-bearing mice was assessed over
30 consecutive days. The mice were then euthanized, and
the tumors were removed. As shown in Figure 7A, tumor
growth was significantly inhibited by ADP treatment, as
indicated by a significant decrease in tumor volume of
301.9 ± 3121.6 mm3 compared with that observed for the

increased rapidly in the control group, as shown in Figure
7B. The excised tumors from the control group weighed
0.98 ± 0.29 g, whereas the weights of the tumors from the
ADP-treated animals and RAPA-treated animals averaged
0.28 ± 0.16 g and 0.34 ± 0.11 g, respectively.
The tumors were sectioned and stained with
hematoxylin/eosin for conventional histology. As expected,
the histological examination revealed high cellularity in
all U87-MG subcutaneous tumors. Enlarged intercellular
spaces were observed in the treated tumors as a hallmark
of ADP efficacy (Figure 7C). Accordingly, U87-MG cell
proliferation was reduced in the treated tumors, revealing
apoptin-mediated tumor efficacy and a loss of cell structure
integrity. Moreover, electron microscopy analyses also
revealed differences between the treated tumors and the
control samples. As expected, the histological examination
revealed high cellularity in all U87-MG subcutaneous
tumors. Enlarged intercellular spaces were observed in
treated tumors, indicating the efficacy of ADP (Figure 7C).

Overall, these results demonstrate that ADP has a stronger
ability to inhibit tumor cell invasion in vivo compared
with RAPA.
For U87-MG subcutaneous tumors, the mice were
treated with ADP and TMZ or with vehicle from five to
14 days after cell implantation. A total of 12 orthotopic
intracranial tumors were generated in nude mice after the
stereotactic injection of U87-MG cells. Of the 12 mice,
four mice (U87-MG) were treated with ADP, four mice
(U87-MG) were treated with TMZ, and four mice were
treated with PBS.
After the experimental treatments, we extracted the
brains of the mice using U-type tweezers and stained the
tissues to look for tumors using a microscope. Only mice
bearing tumors were included in the survival analyses.
Interestingly, ADP treatment induced significant survival
benefits compared with vehicle injection (p < 0.001 for
U87-MG). The median survival was increased more than
two-fold in the ADP-treated mice. A similar improvement

in median survival was observed in the TMZ-treated mice.
The survival curve for the ADP group was essentially flat
(Figure 8A).
The apoptin-derived peptide was administered to
the mice via tail vein injection, and an abnormal reaction
was rarely observed. Dynamic MRI conducted for
seven consecutive days revealed tumor foci after ADP
administration. We measured the tumor volume using MRI
software and performed HE staining after the animals were
euthanized. As shown in Figure 8B, the tumor volume of
the control group increased over time.
The tumor volume was clearly reduced in the ADP
group, as indicated by the lack of detection of these tumors
by MRI. Moreover, the relative reduction in tumor volume
after TMZ administration was less than that observed
in the ADP group. After one week of continuous TMZ
administration, the tumor-bearing mice exhibited a loss of
appetite and decreased mobility. The treatment and control
groups presented statistically significant differences.
Conventional histology was analyzed using HE staining
and antibodies targeting either Ki-67 or glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP).
GBM cell proliferation was reduced in the treated
tumors, as demonstrated by decreased Ki-67 staining.
Moreover, an increase in GFAP staining in the ADPtreated tumors suggested U87-MG cell differentiation.
First, enlargement of the intercellular spaces was
noted in the ADP-treated tumors (Figure 8C f(1)). In
addition, the treatment induced chromatin aggregation
within the nuclei (Figure 8C f(2)) and glial filament
accumulation (Figure  8C. f(3)). The apoptotic bodies
simultaneously increased, indicating ongoing cell
death and differentiation. Interestingly, HE staining
indicated that ADP treatment could inhibit glioma cells
in vivo. Compared with the control group, the ADP group

surprisingly showed obvious reductions in both satellitelike cell masses and changes of apoptotic morphology
(Figure 8C). Electron microscopy analyses also revealed
differences between the treated and control tumors.
The histological analysis of HE-stained brain
sections revealed large lobular tumors in the PBS- and
ADP-treated groups (Figure 8D). Large tumors were also
observed in the PBS-treated mice. The mice treated with
PBS presented large numbers of ring-like tumors dispersed
around the striatum. We also observed tumors distant from
the U-87 cell injection site, and cell invasion was increased
along the corpus callosum. In the ADP treatment group,
only a few tumor cells were observed near the injection
site, and a small number of tumor masses were present at
the administration site, demonstrating significant inhibition
of tumor mass growth consistent with the MRI findings.
All of these results indicated that continuous injections of
ADP were the most efficient treatment against GBM.

DISCUSSION
HSP70 generally exhibits increased expression
in GBM tissues compared with normal brain tissues.
Endogenous HSP70 protects cancer cells from cell
apoptosis, thus conferring resistance to cell death. [13, 14].
Extracellularly, HSP70 is a danger signal that induces
antitumor immune responses. Preclinical data have
hinted that HSP70 release is significantly increased in
glioblastoma cell lines treated with fractionated radiation
at single doses of 2 Gy [11]. Intracellularly, increased copy
numbers of HSP70 mRNA are correlated with high-grade
gliomas. Interestingly, HSP70 expression was found to
be significantly increased in GBM compared with NBT.
Furthermore, we did not detect HSP70 expression in NBT
surrounding the tumor. The available data indicate that

HSP70 is expressed in the primary tumors and in relapsed
de novo GBM patients [7]. An increased expression of
extracellular HSP70 was noted in relapsed patients. The
significant increase in HSP70 expression observed in
relapsed patients might serve as a molecular target of
novel therapy approaches [12].
Our previous results showed that TAT-apoptin
inhibits HSP70 expression in tumor cells such as liver
cancer and gliomas, and the ensuing apoptosis was
dependent on the HSP70 expression levels. Furthermore,
apoptin inhibited the transcription of HSP70 by binding
to the HSE, which downregulated HSP70 expression [8,
15]. We further sought to identify the shortest sequence
of apoptin that could promote HSP70 downregulation
and mimic the inhibitory activity of apoptin. The current
EMSA results showed that NSL1 (amino acids: 82-88)
and NSL2 (amino acids: 111-121) strongly interact with
the HSE. LRS sequences are plentiful in hydrophobic
proteins. Using pull-down assays, we confirmed the
interaction between HSP70 and the domain of apoptin
corresponding to amino acids 33-46 (LRS). We aimed
to increase the ability of apoptin to induce tumor cell
apoptosis while reducing the length of its polypeptide
sequence. Thus, we removed the NES (amino acids: 97105) domain and retained the NLS1 and NLS2 domains,
which were connected by LRS. The LRS structure forms

a flexible connection between the two sequences in the
nucleus to effectively maintain the original independent
structure. The LRS is consistent with the notion that the
β-sheet structure on the surface can effectively interact
with HSP70. The TAT (penetrating peptide) sequence was
placed in the N-terminal peptide chain. TAT is effective
in protecting the apoptin-HSE polypeptide during cellular
entry. Furthermore, we tested the activity of ADP in GBM
cell lines (U87-MG, U251-MG) as well as in subcutaneous
and orthotopic glioma models and found that ADP is an
efficient treatment for GBM tumors.
Some apoptosis-related sequences are closely
related to the specific binding capacity of tumor cells. For
example, the pro-apoptosis activity of apoptin involves the
nuclear sequence (NLS), the NES, and the phosphorylation
of amino acid 108. The level of specifically targeted tumor
apoptosis was decreased slightly by the ADP structure
without nuclear sequences and no phosphorylation of
amino acid 108 [9, 16, 17]. We hypothesized that ADP
would not exhibit the ability to target tumor cells. A portion
of normal glial cells were killed in our experiments,
but ADP retained the vast majority of the antitumorspecific targeting capabilities of apoptin. When the T108
phosphorylation site is abolished, the nuclear localization
of apoptin in tumor cells does not change significantly.
[16, 18]. These confounding might be because both the

N- and C-terminal domains of apoptin can bind DNA. In
addition, phosphorylating (T108) is only required for the C
terminus, whereas the N terminus is not affected by tumorselective phosphokinases [10, 18, 19].
The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway serves an important
role in cell survival and cell death processes; different stimuli
elicit different effects [20–22]. The toxicity of apoptin
depends on hyperactivation of the PI3K-Akt pathway [19,
23], which results in the nuclear translocation of Akt [18].
Akt is normally localized in the cytoplasm but relocates to
the nucleus in the presence of apoptin [24]. Nuclear Akt
acts as an apoptosis stimulator rather than as a repressor
because it can interact with and phosphorylate a different
set of substrates in the nucleus [25]. Therefore, apoptin has
been proposed to ‘hijack’ the prosurvival PI3K/Akt pathway
[23]. Our results show that although ADP lacked most of

the apoptosis sequences of apoptin, it retained its ability to
interact with AKT. Thus, we hypothesized that ADP inhibits
the prosurvival PI3K/Akt pathway and induces apoptosis.
The direct interaction of apoptin with the SH3
domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K through its
proline-rich sequence is necessary for its cytotoxic activity
of apoptotic cells [19]. Recent studies by Panigrahi et al.
[26] and Jaganmohan et al. [27] suggested that TATapoptin not only strongly binds to the SH3 domain of BcrAbl but also modifies the phosphorylation state of Bcr-Abl
and the activity of its downstream targets. These changes
result in the induction of natural apoptosis in myeloid
leukemia cells. ADP (via PI3K/Akt signaling) inhibits
cell migration and invasion by blocking PI3K activity,
reducing p-Akt levels, and downregulating MMP-9
expression in tumor cells (data not shown).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The pathogenesis of GBM is complex, and there
are no effective treatments for this disease [28–31]. Aside
from surgical excision, temozolomide (TMZ), an orally
administered DNA alkylating agent, is the most effective
chemotherapy available for GBM patients [2]. However,
some patients develop resistance to TMZ, and the overall
outcome of GBM patients has not exponentially improved
[32]. This is an important finding because GBM therapies
fail due to tumor recurrence [33]. Our results show that the
anti-cancer activity of the ADP compares favorably with
those of temozolomide and rapamycin.
We believe that ADP is the most efficient treatment
against GBM tumors because ADP addresses three major
challenges in current GBM therapy: (i) Because ADP is
smaller than apoptin, it exhibits reduced immunogenicity.
In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that ADP exhibits
stronger antitumor activity against GBM. (ii) ADP is based
on the reduction of HSP70 in tumor cells targeted with
apoptin transformation-derived peptides. This molecule
more rapidly reduces HSP70 expression at the mRNA and
protein levels, suggesting stronger anti-tumor activity.
Thus, this molecule has stronger potential for treating
cancer. (iii) Although TMZ greatly improved the clinical
treatment of GBM, resistance mechanisms limit its use for
long periods of time. The combination of this treatment
with ADP might reduce or eliminate drug resistance, thus
providing a new method for GBM treatment.
In conclusion, our research explored the apoptin
domain region that interacts with the HSE and further
showed the anti-cancer effects of the cell-permeable
version of ADP in HSP70-expressing human cancer
cell lines. Our results provide the first demonstration
that the numbers of Ki-67- and GFAP-expressing cells
were decreased and increased, respectively, in xenografts
upon ADP administration. The treatment also induced
cell detachment in vitro and increased the sizes of
the intercellular spaces in vivo. Due to its cytotoxic
properties, ADP efficiently reduced disease progression
in vivo. Indeed, the treatment inhibited tumor xenograft
growth and increased the overall health and survival of
nude mice implanted with GBM cell lines. These effects
were measured in tumors obtained from cell lines and
were observed in both intracranial and subcutaneous
xenografts.
To conclude, we provide the first demonstration
that an apoptin-derived peptide, known as ADP, acts as
an effective therapeutic drug in human GBM. This study
supports ADP as a potent candidate for drug development
and offers the advantages of favorable toxicity and
pharmacokinetic profiles. In addition, its use offers
time- and cost-saving benefits. Further investigations to
determine its underlying mechanisms and its place among
the therapeutic strategies for the treatment of GBM are
warranted.

Cell lines, patient cohort, polypeptides, and
plasmids
The human glioma cell lines U87-MG and U251-MG
were obtained from the Department of the Third
Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University. Human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from
the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences Cell
Resource Center. Rat glioma cells (C6-RFP) and human
normal brain radial glial HA cells were purchased from
ATCC (China) and were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2
in complete DMEM (Beijing hiSoft Biological Chemical
Co., Ltd., China) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Zhejiang Tianhang Biological Technology
Co., Ltd., China). pcDNA3.1-SP70,pcDNA3.1plasmids
were constructed in our laboratory. The ADP and GSTADP were synthesized by the Chinese biotechnology
company Yaoqiang. Surgical specimens of the primary
tumor and the respective in-field tissues were received
from the archives of the Department of Pathology at the
Daqing Oilfield General Hospital. The use of animals was
approved by the Ethic Committees of Harbin Medical
University, and all experimental procedures were
conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Ethics
Committees of Harbin Medical University. Informed
consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was
approved.

Immunohistochemistry and HE staining
A morphological analysis of human glioma
tissues and BALB/c mouse gliomas through HE
staining was performed one week post-injection. All
samples were fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde
and embedded into liquid paraffin, and 3-μm sections
were then stretched in hot water, mounted onto
positively charged slides, and air-dried overnight at
37°C. HE-stained histological sections on the glass
slides were used to confirm the presence of tumor
tissue. Conventional immunohistochemistry for Ki-67
(ab136912, Abcam, USA), GFAP (ab194326, Abcam,
USA), and HSP70 (ab5444, Abcam, USA) was
performed. The sections were observed with a light
microscope (Olympus, Japan), and statistical analyses
were performed.

Real-time quantitative PCR
The total RNA from U87-MG, U251-MG, and HA
cells as well as NBT and GBM tissue was harvested using
the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s recommended protocol. cDNA synthesis
was performed using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
31129

Oncotarget

GST pull-down assay, protein identification, and
immunoprecipitation (IP)

Transcription Kit (Haigene, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The HSP70 mRNA levels
were quantified using the Fast SYBR Green Master Mix
(Haigene, China) and an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems, USA). GAPDH was used
as an internal standard for HSP70. PCR was performed
using the gene-specific primers NCBI accession number:
NM_005345; forward: GCAACGTGCTCATCTTTGA;
reverse: TCGCTTGTTCTGGCTGATGT (Jima, China).
Each sample was analyzed at least in triplicate. The internal
mRNA levels were standardized according to a method
described by Applied Biosystems. mRNA expression was
represented by the threshold cycle (Ct), and the relative
expression level of HSP70 was calculated using the
2−ΔΔCt method.

The GST and recombinant GST-ADP proteins were
purified using glutathione sepharose beads (Pierce, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol.
A GST pull-down assay was performed to detect the
interaction partners of apoptin. Briefly, either purified GST
or GST-ADP along with the total U87-MG cell lysate was
immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads overnight at
4°C in IP buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors.
For step-specific actions, refer to a previous study [30].

Tumor growth experiments
All animal experiments were approved by the
Harbin Medical University Subcommittee on Research
Animal Care (China) and were performed in accordance
with the guidelines and regulations set by the National
Institutes of Health. Female 4- to 6-week-old athymic
nude mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 100 mg/kg
ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine in 0.9% sterile saline. U87MG cells were intracranially injected at a rate of 0.4 μL/
minute using a Micro 4 Microsyringe Pump Controller
(Hamilton, Switzerland) attached to a syringe with a needle
(Gaoge, China) into the mid-left striatum at the following
coordinates from the bregma: +0.45 mm anterior-posterior,
+2.0 mm mediolateral, and –2.4 mm dorsoventral.
Each U87-MG glioma model mouse was injected with
approximately 3 × 105 U87-MG cells in 3 μL of DMEM. The
animals were examined daily for alertness, motor deficits,
and the presence of neurological signs, and their body
weights were measured daily. After two weeks, the tumor
size was measured by MRI, and the mice were injected with
ADP (5 mg/kg/day), PBS alone or TMZ (25 mg/kg/day)
via the intraperitoneal route. The mice belonging to the
ADP group were injected with 20 µg of bradykinin (BK) in
20 µL of PBS, and 15 minutes later, an injection of 20 mg of
ADP in 0.1 mL of PBS was administered. After one to two
weeks of continuous ADP administration, the tumor size
was measured by MRI. At the end of the experiment, the
mice were sacrificed for histopathological analysis. A 3.0-T
MRI machine (GE) at Daqing Oilfield General Hospital was
used to measure the tumor size through T1 WI, T2 WI, and
enhanced T1 WI and T2 WI scans.
For subcutaneous implantation, 5 × 105 cells were
subcutaneously injected in the right flanks of the mice.
Tumors were apparent one to two weeks after injection.
As soon as the subcutaneous tumors reached a volume of
2 to 4 mm3, the mice were randomized into two equivalent
groups and administered intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections
for 15 days of ADP (5 mg/kg) or RAPA (5 mg/kg) as a
positive control. The tumor size and general clinical status
were recorded every five days and calculated using the
following formula: volume (mm3) = (length × width2)/2.
After five weeks of treatment, the mice were euthanized,

Cell viability assay
A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to measure glioma
cell viability. Briefly, glioma cells (1×105 cells/well) were
seeded into a 96-well plate with ADP (China Peptides,
China) at final concentrations of 20, 40, 60, 80, and
100 μg/mL or 32 μM RAPA (Tasyl Diyi Pharmaceutical
Co., China) for 24 hours. In addition, U87-MG cells
were treated with 80 μg/mL ADP, and U251-MG cells
were treated with 90 μg/mL ADP, HA (90 μg/mL), or
C6 (90 μg/mL) for different amounts of time (12, 24, 36,
and 48 hours). Twenty microliters of MTT solution were
added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an
additional 4 hours. After the medium was discarded,
150  μL of DMSO was added, and the absorbance at
490 nm was recorded.
In addition, apoptosis was detected by flow
cytometry using an Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide
(PI) kit (Beyotime, China). Briefly, the cells were pelleted,
resuspended in 20 μg/mL Annexin-V-FITC, washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained with 5 μg/mL
PI. The samples were subjected to flow cytometry on a
BD FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson), and the data were
analyzed using FlowJo software.

Immunofluorescence and fluorescent imaging
The cells were cultured in DMEM and were treated
with ADP (80 μg/mL), apoptin (100 μg/mL), or PBS.
After culture for 6, 12, or 24 hours, the cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.1%
Triton X-100, and stained with either HSP70 (ab5444,
Abcam, USA) or TAT antibody (sc-376292, Santa Cruz,
USA) and then with their respective secondary antibodies
conjugated to Cy3. Twenty milliliters of Hoechst 33342
or DAPI nuclear dye were then added to each well for
20 minutes, and the cells were washed three times with
PBS and stained with AO/EB. The fluorescence signal
was acquired through multi-laser confocal microscopy.

and the tumors were excised and rinsed in PBS. A 1-mm3
portion was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The remaining
tumor was then fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
for histological analysis.
