Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cellular senescence both protects multicellular organisms from cancer and contributes to their
aging1. The preeminent tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in the induction and
maintenance of senescence, but how p53 carries out this function remains poorly understood1–3.
Additionally, while increasing evidence supports the notion that metabolic changes underlie many
cell fate decisions and p53-mediated tumor suppression, few connections between metabolic
enzymes and senescence have been established. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which
p53 links the functions. We show that p53 represses the expression of the tricarboxylic acid cycle
(TCA cycle)-associated malic enzyme 1 (ME1) and malic enzyme 2 (ME2). Both MEs are
important for NADPH production, lipogenesis, and glutamine metabolism, with ME2 having a
more profound effect. Through inhibiting MEs, p53 regulates cell metabolism and proliferation.
Down-regulation of ME1 and ME2 reciprocally activates p53 through distinct Mdm2 and AMPKmediated mechanisms in a feed-forward manner, bolstering this pathway and enhancing p53
activation. Down-regulation of ME1 and ME2 also modulates the outcome of p53 activation
leading to strong induction of senescence, but not apoptosis, while enforced expression of either
ME suppresses senescence. Our findings define physiological functions of MEs, demonstrate a
positive feedback mechanism that sustains p53 activation, and reveal a connection between
metabolism and senescence mediated by p53.

We previously found that p53 inhibits the important NADPH producer glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD)4. As this did not fully explain the effect of p53 on NADPH, we
investigated whether p53 controls expression of MEs, which catalyze the oxidative
decarboxylation of malate to generate pyruvate and either NADPH or NADH5,6
(Supplementary Fig. 1). In mammalian cells three ME isoforms have been identified: a
cytosolic NADP+-dependent isoform (ME1), a mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent isoform
(ME2), and a mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isoform (ME3), with ME1 and ME2 are the

major isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 2a)7. By recycling the TCA cycle intermediate malate
into the common TCA cycle carbon source pyruvate, MEs may have a regulatory role in
matching TCA flux to cellular demand for energy, reducing equivalents, and biosynthetic
precursors (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We knocked down p53 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells and normal diploid fibroblast
IMR90 cells using small hairpin (sh) RNA. This led to a significant increase in mRNA
levels of ME1 and ME2 (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2b), accompanied by elevated
protein levels and total enzymatic activity of ME1 and ME2 (Fig. 1a, c and Supplementary
Fig. 2c). Likewise, expression of ME1 and ME2 were substantially higher in p53 knockout
(p53−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to p53-wild-type (p53+/+) MEFs
(Fig. 1d). The normally short-lived p53 protein is stabilized by DNA damage signals. Cells
treated with the genotoxic agents etoposide (ETO) and doxorubicin (DOX) showed both
time- and concentration-dependent reductions in the expression of ME1 and ME2 (Fig. 1e
and Supplementary Fig. 2b, d–f). When p53 was knocked down, the expression of ME1 and
ME2 no longer responded to DNA damage (Fig. 1e). These results demonstrate that the
expression of ME1 and ME2 is controlled by p53 both at basal levels and when p53 is
stabilized by DNA damage signals.

By analyzing the ME gene sequences, we identified a putative p53 response element (RE)8
in the first intron of the ME1 gene (ME1-RE) and three putative REs in the first intron of the
ME2 gene (ME2-RE1 to ME2-RE3) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that p53 bound to the genomic regions of the
ME1-RE, ME2-RE1, and ME2-RE3, but not ME2-RE2. This binding was further enhanced
when p53 was stabilized by treatment with DOX (Fig. 1f). p53 repressed the expression of a
luciferase gene driven by the genomic fragments containing ME1-RE, ME2-RE1, or ME2RE3, but not ME2-RE2 (Supplementary Fig. 3b). p53-mediated repression of certain target
genes involves histone deacetylases (HDACs)9. Treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), an
inhibitor of HDACs, abrogated p53-mediated repression of ME1 and ME2 genes
(Supplementary Fig. 2g).
p53 deficiency also led to a strong increase in ME3 transcript (Supplementary Fig. 4a). A
putative p53 RE is present in the first intron of the ME3 gene (ME3-RE) (Supplementary
Fig. 4b). p53 bound to the genomic region of ME3-RE in cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c) and
reduced the expression of a luciferase reporter driven by this RE (Supplementary Fig. 4d).
Given the low abundance of ME3 expression in cell lines that have been tested
(Supplementary Fig. 2a)7, we focused on ME1 and ME2 in subsequent analyses.

Although ME1 and ME2 have been extensively characterized in vitro, there is a paucity of
information on their functions in cells. Silencing the expression of ME1 or particularly ME2
with small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced cellular NADPH levels (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Fig. 5a). This effect was also observed when a separate set of ME siRNAs,
as well as ME shRNAs, were used (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c). In contrast, forced expression
of ME1 or especially ME2, or the addition of an ME substrate (dimethyl L-malate), elevated
cellular NADPH levels (Fig. 2b, lanes 1–3; Supplementary Fig. 5d). To determine whether
the effect of MEs is due to their enzymatic activity, we generated two ME1 mutations

(ME1mut1 and ME1mut2) and three ME2 mutations (ME2mut1 to ME2mut3), each of which
exhibited little or no enzymatic activity in vitro as well as in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 6).
None of these mutants were able to increase cellular NADPH levels (Fig. 2b, lanes 4–10).
Thus, both ME1 and ME2 are required for maintaining cellular NADPH levels through their
enzymatic activity, with ME2 having a more profound effect. As previously observed4,
knockdown of p53 led to a significant increase in NADPH levels. This increase was partially
reversed through the silencing of ME1 and was near completely reversed through silencing
of ME2 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). These results indicate that p53 regulates
NADPH metabolism through the suppression of both MEs, particularly ME2.

As NADPH provides reducing equivalents for reductive biosynthesis, we examined the role
of MEs in lipid production. MEF cells and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured with a
cocktail that stimulated their differentiation into adipocytes4,10. Triglycerides and total lipid
levels in these cells declined when ME1 or particularly ME2 was depleted in these cells (Fig.
2c and Supplementary Fig. 7). In contrast, over-expression of ME1 or especially ME2, but
none of the ME1 and ME2 mutants, increased lipid abundance (Fig. 2d). Concordant with
previously published data4, we observed a marked increase in lipid levels in p53-deficient
cells compared to p53-proficient cells. ME1 knockdown partially reversed this increase,
while ME2 knockdown prevented it entirely correlating with its greater influence on cellular
NADPH levels (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 7). These results suggest that the enhanced
lipid accumulation in p53 deficient cells is dependent on the MEs, especially ME2.

Silencing of ME2, as well as ME1, did not significantly alter NADH levels or the NAD+/
NADH ratio in IMR90 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b), despite that ME2 is characterized as
either NADP+- or NAD+-dependent5,6. NADH can be oxidized by the electron transport
chain for ATP production. Silencing of each ME did not significantly alter the abundance of
cellular ATP or ADP in IMR90 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8c). In U2OS cells silencing of
ME1, but not ME2, reduced NADH levels and increased the NAD+/NADH ratio
(Supplementary Fig. 8d, e). These results are consistent with a cell-type specific role of ME1
and a minimal role of ME2 in maintaining cellular NADH and ATP levels.
Next we investigated the role of ME1 and ME2 in the metabolism of glucose and glutamine.
In p53−/− HCT116 cells silencing of either ME, especially ME2, strongly reduced glutamine
consumption (Fig. 2e), while silencing of either ME had a moderate effect on glucose
consumption. We extended this analysis by evaluating the rate of glutaminolysis. Depletion
of either ME1 or ME2 noticeably slowed down glutaminolytic flux (Fig. 2f). These results
suggest that both ME1 and ME2 have a major role in glutamine metabolism but a relative
minor role in glucose metabolism.

p53 plays a critical role in the induction and maintenance of senescence1–3. We noticed that
in IMR90 cells, a well-established senescence model, silencing of each ME by either siRNA
or shRNA caused a profound increase in cells expressing senescence-associated βgalactosidase (SA-β-gal) and stopping growth (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 9a–f). The
induction of senescence in ME-knockdown cells was also indicated by the dramatic
accumulation the promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs)11,12 (Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Fig. 9g). Remarkably, even a moderate reduction (20–30%) in either

ME1 or ME2 strongly elicited senescence (Supplementary Fig. 10a). ME loss-induced
senescence also occurred in tumor cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c). In p53-deficient
primary and tumor cell lines, senescence decreased markedly, and ME depletion lost its
ability to induce this phenotype (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Figs. 9b, c, f, g, 10c). In
contrast, ME depletion did not cause cell death (Supplementary Fig. 11a), and it induced the
expression of p53-target genes implicated in senescence2,13 but not apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. 11b). These data suggest that down-regulation of ME induces
senescence via p53.

We next examined the role of MEs in replicative senescence of normal human cells, a p53regulated process1,3. IMR90 cells were serially passaged in culture until a substantial
number of them (~50%) entered senescence. The expression of ME1 remained at
comparable levels at different passages, while the expression of ME2, which stayed
unchanged initially, noticeably declined at the late stage (Fig. 3d). To test whether the
decline in ME2 contributes to senescence in this setting, we evaluated the replicative
capacity of IMR90 cells forced to express ME2. Compared with control cells, ME2overexpressing cells could be cultured for extended passages with a greatly delayed onset of
senescence (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 12a). As ME1 expression was maintained
during replicative senescence, we were surprised to observe a delay in senescence when
ME1 expression was forced (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 12a). In contrast, forced
expression of any of the ME mutants did not delay senescence and instead moderately
promoted senescence (Supplementary Fig. 12b–d), possibly through a dominant negative
effect on the endogenous MEs. These results indicate that both MEs, and especially ME2,
are capable of suppressing senescence and suggest that the decline in ME2 may contribute to
replicative senescence.

Author Manuscript

To examine the effect of MEs on other scenarios of p53-regulated senescence, we found that
culturing IMR90 cells in medium containing no glutamine resulted in p53-dependent
senescence (Supplementary Fig. 13a). This senescence could be delayed by over-expression
of either ME1 or ME2 (Supplementary Fig. 13b), or the addition of the ME substrate malate
(Supplementary Fig. 13c). In contrast, exogenous ME expression did not influence
premature senescence of IMR90 cells induced by the oncogene RasV12 (Supplementary Fig.
13d), which is not dependent on p53 (Ref. 14,15). These results suggest that ME1 and ME2
expression suppress the specific way in which p53 induces senescence.

Author Manuscript

We investigated the mechanism for ME down-regulation-induced senescence. In IMR90 and
U2OS cells where the expression of either ME1 or ME2 was silenced by siRNA, even
moderately, p53 levels were elevated, accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of p53 and
induction of its target gene p21 (Fig. 2a, 4a and Supplementary Fig. 5a, 5b, 10a). In contrast,
over-expression of ME1 or ME2 in IMR90 cells substantially reduced p53 levels and
activity in late passages (Fig. 3f). Over-expression of ME1 or ME2 also diminished DNA
damage-induced p53 activation (Supplementary Fig. 14). These observations suggest a
strong role of MEs in the suppression of p53. They also indicate the existence of a positive
feedback loop for the p53-ME pathway: a higher p53 level leads to less ME expression,
which alleviates the inhibition of MEs on p53, leading to even higher p53 activation.

We examined the mechanism for the regulation of p53 by ME. In unstressed cells, Mdm2mediated ubiquitination maintains a low basal level of p53 (Ref. 2). When ME1 was
knocked down, the abundance of the Mdm2 protein and mRNA declined markedly (Fig. 4a
and Supplementary Fig. 15a, b), suggesting that ME1 down-regulation activates p53 through
a reduction in Mdm2 expression. ME2 knockdown did not significantly affect Mdm2 levels.
Instead, it turned on AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 15a,
b), an intracellular energy gauge that activates p53 via phosphorylation16. We tested whether
AMPK is required for induction of p53 by ME2 by knocking it down and by comparing
AMPK-null and -wild-type MEFs. In both situations, loss of AMPK prevented ME2
knockdown from activating p53 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 15c). Because silencing of
ME2 did not influence cellular ATP levels (Supplementary Fig. 8c), we examined other
pathways that could activate AMPK in ME2-depleted cells and observed a strong increase in
reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 16), correlating with a
strong reduction in NADPH levels (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). ROS are a known
activator of AMPK17. Treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) blocked
AMPK and p53 activation (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 17a, b), abrogated senescence,
and restored growth of ME2-knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 17c, d). These results
suggest that down-regulation of ME2 increases ROS levels leading to sequential activation
of AMPK and p53 and the induction of senescence. In comparison, depletion of ME1
increased ROS levels moderately in IMR90 cells and minimally in U2OS cells (Fig. 4c and
Supplementary Fig. 16), and NAC only slightly affected p53 activation, senescence, and
growth arrest in ME1-depeleted cells (Supplementary Fig. 17b–d).

Previous studies on limited tumor samples suggest that the activity of ME2 is highly
elevated in these tumors and correlates with tumor progression18–20. A survey of public
gene expression databases (http://www.oncomine.org) showed that both ME1 and ME2
expression was significantly up-regulated in a variety of human cancers (Supplementary Fig.
18). We investigated whether MEs could influence tumor cell growth. Depletion of ME1 or
ME2 in tumor cells, regardless of p53 status, strongly impaired their growth (Supplementary
Fig. 19), and reduced the number of cells at the S phase of the cell cycle (Supplementary
Fig. 20). In contrast, over-expression of ME1 or ME2, but none of the ME mutants,
enhanced tumor cell growth (Supplementary Fig. 21). In a soft agar assay, tumor cells
deprived of ME expression, unlike their control counterparts, failed to form anchorageindependent colonies (Supplementary Fig. 22a, b), while cells transduced with wild-type
MEs, but not any of the ME mutants, showed enhanced anchorage-independent growth
(Supplementary Fig. 22c, d).

To analyze MEs’ function in the tumor xenograft model, we injected immunocompromised
mice with p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 cells treated with ME or control siRNA. p53−/−
HCT116 cells gave rise to tumors that were twice the weight of tumors generated by p53+/+
HCT116 cells. When ME1 or especially ME2 was silenced in these cells, the tumor sizes
were markedly reduced (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 23a, b). p53+/+ HCT116 tumors
devoid of MEs showed extensive senescence and were substantially smaller compared to the
corresponding p53−/− HCT116 tumors (Supplementary Fig. 23c). Conversely, overexpression of wild-type ME1 or ME2, not mutant MEs, accelerated the growth of p53+/+

HCT116 tumors (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 23d). These observations indicate that MEs
are essential for tumor growth through both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Although p53 is able to induce a range of anti-proliferative responses, emerging evidence
indicates that senescence induction and metabolic regulation are central to its function as a
tumor suppressor13,21–25. Our results demonstrate a positive feedback loop comprising of
p53 and MEs that influences p53 activation and links metabolism with the onset of
senescence (Supplementary Fig. 24). p53 suppresses all ME (1, 2, and 3) expression by
directly binding to REs within these genes. Together with our recent finding that p53 targets
the NADPH producer G6PD through a distinct direct catalytic mechanism4, the current
study reveals p53 as a master immediate regulator of cellular NADPH levels. p53 is
reciprocally regulated by ME1 and ME2. The marked stabilization of p53 upon ME1 and
ME2 down-regulation is achieved through different mechanisms, via the decline in the
Mdm2 levels and ROS-induced AMPK activation, respectively. These findings support the
notion that p53 is a central sentinel for metabolic stresses and coordinates metabolic
pathways with cell fate decision.

Author Manuscript

Mutual regulation of p53 and MEs is likely a major mechanism that modulates cellular
senescence in both normal and tumor cells. Even moderate down-regulation of either ME1
or ME2 strongly induces p53 activation and senescence, while over-expression of either
enzyme delays these processes. Thus, MEs modulate not only the amplitude but also the
outcome of p53 activation. p53 is subjected to negative feedback regulation (e.g. the p53Mdm2 feedback loop) that restrains its activity2. The p53-MEs positive feedback loop is
likely important to alleviate the negative feedback regulation so that p53 can accumulate to
high levels. This may be particularly relevant in situations where robust and persistent p53
activation is desirable, such as the induction and maintenance of senescence. The
involvement of the p53-ME pathway in senescence demonstrates a close link between
metabolism and this irreversible fate of the cell.

Cell lysate fractionation and ME activity

Author Manuscript

Cell fractionation was carried out as described29. Cells were homogenized in 20 mM
HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM sodium EDTA, 1 mM sodium
EGTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol in the presence of 250 mM sucrose and protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). Homogenates were centrifuged at 500 g for 5
min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 10,000 g for 20 min
to obtain cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions.

Author Manuscript

ME1 activity was determined using cytosolic extracts as described30. The reaction buffer
contained 67 mM triethanolamine, 3.3 mM L-malic acid, 0.3 mM β-NADP+, and 5.0 mM
manganese chloride. For measuring ME2 activity, mitochondria were purified as described29
and re-suspended in mitochondrial lysis buffer (20 mM MOPS-KOH pH7.4, 250 mM
sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor
cocktail) on ice for 30 min by gentle vortexing for 5 s at 5 min intervals. Lysates were
centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C. The enzyme reaction mixtures contained 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM NAD+, and 3.3 mM L-malic acid. The
reactions were started by adding either cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts, and were
monitored by absorbance at 340 nm every 5 s for up to 10 min. Background control was run
without L-malic acid as substrate. Enzyme activity was determined by subtracting the
activity of the background control to each sample. The resulting changes of absorbance
versus time were normalized to protein contents, which were determined using the Bio-Rad
protein assay.
Analysis of ME gene sequence and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

We used the Genomatix Promoter Inspector software (URL: http://www.genomatix.de) to
search in ME genes for potential p53 REs with the consensus sequence 5’RRRCWWGYYY-(0–13bp spacer)-RRRCWW GYYY-3’, where R is a purine, Y a
pyrimidine, and W either A or T8. The sequences for the putative p53 REs in ME genes are:
ME1-RE, 5’-ttacctggttaactaggacttgccc-3’; ME2-RE1, 5’-aggcatgcaccaccatgccc-3’; ME2RE2, 5’-agaccagtcaaaaacatgtcc-3’; ME2-RE3, 5’-gggcatgatggcacatgcct-3’, and ME3-RE, 5’tgacttggtttggctttcttgtcc-3’.

For ChIP assay, cells were washed with PBS and cross-linked with a 1% formaldehyde
solution for 15 min at RT. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine
to 125 mM final concentration. Cell lysates were sonicated to generate DNA fragments with
the average size below 1000 bp and followed by immunoprecipitation with indicated
antibodies. Bounded DNA fragments were eluted and amplified by PCR. The primer pairs
were: ME1-RE: 5’-GCCTTAGTATGTGGATTC-3’ and 5’GGAAAGCGTAGGGAAGGA-3’; ME2-ME1: 5’-GTTGCCCAGGCTGGAGTG-3’ and 5’CTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3’; ME2-RE2: 5’-TCAGCACTTTGGGAGG-3’ and 5’GCGACAGAGTCTTGCC-3’; ME2-RE3: 5’-GGCTCAGTGGCTCACG-3’ and 5’GTGCAGTGGCATG-3’; ME3-RE: 5’-GTTGCGATCCCGTGGCTG-3’ and 5’ACCGCAGGTCAGACTGAC-3’; p21: CTGAAAACAGGCAGCCCAAG-3’ and 5’GTGGCTCTGATTGGCTTTCTG-3’ 28.

Triglyceride was measured using a Triglyceride Assay Kit (BioVision). Total lipids were
measured using Oil Red O staining10. For this, confluent cells were grown in medium with
10% FBS supplemented with insulin (5 µg/ml), dexamethasone (1 μM), troglitazone (5 μM)
and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.5 mM) for 2 days, and in medium supplemented with insulin
and rosiglitazone for an additional 5 days. The medium was changed every other day. Cells
were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature (RT), washed
with dH2O and 60% isopropanol, and stained with a filtered Oil Red O work solution at RT.
Stain was then removed and cells were washed 4 times in dH2O.
Measurement of glutaminolytic flux

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Malic enzyme-dependent glutaminolytic flux (ME flux) was determined by labeling the
malate pool with 13C from [U-13C5] glutamine and monitoring the conversion of malate to
pyruvate indirectly by detecting 13C-labeled lactate. 13C enrichments were determined with
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We observed that this approach results in
approximately 50% 13C enrichment and allows for the determination of glutaminolytic flux
through malic enzyme with high sensitivity. Cells cultured in 10 cm plates with around 60%
confluence were transfected with control, ME1, or ME2 siRNA. Cells were cultured in
regular medium for 60 h and in DMEM containing 12 mM glucose, 3 mM [U-13C5]
glutamine, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for an
additional 9 h. After medium was removed, cells were immediately quenched with cold 80%
methanol. The methanol/cell mass mixtures were centrifuged. The insoluble (protein/lipid)
fraction was analyzed for protein content. The soluble fraction was dried under a stream of
gaseous nitrogen at 40 °C and silylated with N-tertbutyldimethylsilyl-Nmethyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Regis, Morton Grove, IL, USA). The silylated cell
extracts were analyzed with an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph/5975C mass spectrometer
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Mass spectra were quantified with the MSD ChemStation
software (Agilent) and corrected for natural abundance contributions from 13C, 29Si and 30Si
using Isocor (www.python.org)31. The total lactate level was determined with the YSI 7100
Multiparameter Bioanalytical System. The glutaminolytic flux through malic enzymes was

calculated from the equation: FME= FL × (Lm+3)/(Mm+4), where FME = malic enzyme flux,
FL = total lactate flux, Lm+3= fraction of lactate enriched in all 3 carbons, and Mm+4=
fraction of malate enriched in all 4 carbons.
Measurements of ROS
ROS levels were determined as described32. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 µM 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2-DCFDA, Sigma). Afterwards, the cells were washed twice in PBS, treated
with trypsin, and re-suspended in PBS. Fluorescence was immediately measured using a
FACScan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).
Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity

Author Manuscript

The SA-β-gal activity in cultured cells was determined using a Senescence Detection Kit
(BioVision) following the manufacturer's instructions. Percentages of cells that stained
positive were calculated by counting 1,000 cells in random fields per cell line.
Immunofluorescence
Cells treated with siRNA for 48 h were washed with 1×PBS and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde. After being treated with 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were stained using
anti-PML antibody followed by Texas-red conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, and
mounted with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). The images
were acquired with a confocal microscope. 200 nucleuses were selected randomly and PMLNBs with each nucleus were counted.
Cell proliferation assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were treated with siRNAs for 24 h and seeded in 6-well cell culture dishes in
triplicates at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 2 ml of medium containing 10% FBS. The
medium was changed everyday. Cells were counted and cell number at the indicated time
points was determined.
Soft agar assay and xenograft tumor models

Author Manuscript

For soft agar assay, cells were suspended in 1 ml of 10% FBS DMEM medium containing a
0.3% agarose and plated on a firm 0.6% agarose base in 6-well plates (5,000 cells/well) as
described previously33. Cells were then cultured in a 37°C and 5% CO2 incubator for 2
weeks. Images were obtained and colonies were counted under a microscope. Each
experiment was done in triplicate. For mouse xenograft experiment, cells (2×106) were
injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 4- to 5-week-old athymic Balb-c nu/nu male mice
(Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA). Tumor growth was evaluated at 2 weeks postinjection. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines
and regulations and were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
