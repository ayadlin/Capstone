ABSTRACT
The hormone receptor (HR) status and human epidermal growth hormone
receptor 2 (HER2) status of patients with breast cancer may change following
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). This prospective observational study aimed to
evaluate the prognostic impact of receptor conversion in breast cancer patients
treated with NCT.Of the 423 consecutive patients who had residual disease in the
breast after NCT, 55 (13.0%) changed from HR (+) to HR (−), 23 (5.4%) changed
from HR (−) to HR (+), 27 (6.4%) changed from HER2 (+) to HER2 (−), and 13 (3.1%)
changed from HER2 (−) to HER2 (+). A total of 54 (12.8%) changed to the triplenegative (TN) tumor phenotype. The loss of HR positivity was an independent
prognostic factor for worse disease-free survival (DFS) and worse overall survival
(OS) in multivariate survival analysis. Furthermore, the switch to the TN phenotype
after NCT was another independent prognostic factor for worse survival for both DFS
and OS. In conclusion, patients with breast cancer may experience changes in HR
status, HER2 status and tumor phenotype after NCT. The loss of HR positivity and the
switch to the TN phenotype after NCT were associated with a worse patient outcome.

or the opposite conversion [from HR (−) to HR (+)] [6].
However, little information is available on the prognostic
impact of receptor conversion caused by NCT. The
purpose of our study was to assess the discordance rate
of the HR status and the HER2 status in patients with
residual tumors after NCT and to evaluate the prognostic
significance of multiple changes in these statuses.

INTRODUCTION
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) followed by
definitive surgical resection is a commonly utilized
therapeutic approach for locally advanced breast
cancer and is likely to improve the operability of these
patients by downstaging their primary tumors [1–3].
A core needle biopsy (CNB) is commonly performed
to confirm the diagnosis and determine the presence of
immunohistochemical (IHC) markers, such as human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and hormone
(estrogen and progesterone) receptor (HR), which are key
factors in the decision-making process regarding adjuvant
therapy as well as important prognostic indicators [4, 5].
Previous studies have shown that NCT can alter
the status of HR [6–11] and HER2 [8, 10–13]. Patients
showing a conversion from HR (+) to HR (−) tended to
benefit less from NCT compared to those with no change

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
A total of 121 of the 544 patients (22.2%) with
primary breast cancer who received NCT in our study
were considered pathologic complete response (pCR) after
NCT. These complete responders were excluded from
this prospective observational study due to the lack of
residual tumors. The remaining 423 patients (77.8%) with
9600

residual disease in the breast were included in this study
(Supplemental Figure 1). Of the 423 patients, 351 patients
(83.0%) were older than 40 years and 177 patients
(41.8%) were post-menopausal. The median tumor size
of the surgical specimens was three centimeters, and
the average number of lymph nodes involved was four.
All patients underwent one to six cycles of NCT using
a regimen of PC (Paclitaxel and Carboplatin, 24.8%),
CEF (Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil,
28.1%), NE (Navelbine and Epirubicin, 39.9%), TE
(Docetaxel and Epirubicin, 6.1%), or other agents (0.9%).
Approximately 146 patients (53.2%) had high Ki67
expression (Table 1).
We also compared the expression of Ki67 in
different receptor conversion groups. Significantly high
Ki67 expression was observed in the groups with loss of

HR status (mean, 39.0), loss of HER2 status (mean, 36.5)
and a discordant triple-negative (TN) tumor phenotype
(mean, 30.2) (Figure 1).

Discordance in receptor expression measurement
Patients with HR and HER2 status conversions
before and after NCT were divided into four groups:
(+) to (+), (−) to (−), (+) to (−) and (−) to (+). The HR
status of up to 78 patients (18.4%) was converted after
NCT, and this conversion was predominantly from HR
(+) to (−) (55 patients, 13.0%). A total of 23 patients
(5.4%) showed a change in their HR status from (−)
to (+). With regard to HER2 status, 40 patients (9.5%)
presented a discordant HER2 status; of these individuals,
27 (6.3%) were converted from HER2 (+) to HER2 (−),

patients with an HR status gain (HazR = 2.400, P = 0.013
for DFS; HazR = 3.834, P = 0.008 for OS). Loss of HER2
positivity alone was not significantly associated with
DFS or OS.
To exclude the influence of hormone therapy,
we next performed Kaplan–Meier plots to analyze the
prognostic impact of HR conversion among 190 patients
who received hormone therapy. Patients with loss of HR
status after NCT still had significantly worse survival
outcomes compared with patients with a concordant HR

and 13 (3.1%) changed from HER2 (−) to HER2 (+).
We defined the tumor phenotypes as HR (+)/HER2 (−),
HR (+)/HER2 (+), HR (−)/HER2 (+) and HR (−) /HER2
(−). Discordance in tumor phenotypes was observed in
100 patients (23.6%), and 54 patients (12.8%) converted
to TN (Table 1).

Prognostic impact of HR and HER2 conversion
Kaplan–Meier plots for disease-free survival (DFS)
and overall survival (OS) according to HR conversion and
HER2 conversion are shown in Figure 2. Patients showing
a change in their HR status from (+) to (−) after NCT
had significantly worse DFS than the other three groups
of patients (P < 0.001) (Figure 2a). Similar significant
differences in OS were also observed (P < 0.001)
(Figure  2b). According to the four HER2 conversion
groups, patients who remained HER2 (−) after NCT had
better DFS (P < 0.001) (Figure 2c) and OS (P = 0.007)
(Figure 2d).
To further evaluate the difference in patient
survival based on changes in their HR and HER2 statuses
after NCT, univariate and multivariate Cox regression
analyses of DFS and OS were carried out. The results
of univariate  Cox regression analysis are shown in
Supplemental Table 1. The multivariate model included all
variables that were statistically significant in the univariate
analysis except for interactive variables (Table  2). In
the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the number
of positive nodes at surgery (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001),
HR conversion (P  =  0.001 and P = 0.001) and HER2
conversion (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003) were statistically
significant for both DFS and OS; NCT regimens were only
significant for OS (P = 0.002). Among the groups showing
a change in HR status, patients with loss of HR positivity
had significantly worse survival outcomes (Hazard
ratios, HazR = 2.648, P < 0.001 for DFS; HazR = 3.460,
P < 0.001 for OS) compared with positive patients with
a concordant HR status (HazR = 1 for DFS and OS) and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Tumor phenotype conversion and patient
outcomes
Patients showing a conversion of the tumor
phenotype were divided into four groups: concordant nonTN (nTN): the tumor phenotype was unchanged and not
TN; concordant TN: the tumor phenotype was unchanged
and TN; discordant nTN: the tumor phenotype was
changed and the residual tumor was not TN; discordant
TN: the tumor phenotype was changed and the residual
tumor was TN. We performed Kaplan-Meier analyses
of the tumor phenotype conversion (Figure 3). Patients
who maintained the same tumor phenotype with no
changes had significantly better outcomes compared with
discordant cases (P < 0.001 for DFS and P = 0.001 for
OS) (Figure 3a and 3b).
Among these four groups, patients whose
tumor phenotype switched to TN had the worst DFS
(HazR  =  2.713, P < 0.001) and OS (HazR = 2.477,
P  =  0.003) compared with patients with concordant
nTN (HazR = 1 for DFS and OS) and discordant nTN
(HazR = 2.282, P = 0.027 for OS, not significant for
DFS) in multivariate analyses. Similar results are also
seen in Figure 3c and 3d. Patients with concordant TN
and concordant nTN did not reach statistical significance
for DFS or OS (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

The mechanism of the conversion of HR and HER2
status after NCT is complex. It is important to note that
intratumoral heterogeneity can result in the presence of
several different clones with different phenotypes within
individual tumors [18, 19]. Within the same tumor, some
clones are HR (+), while others are HR (−). Likewise,
HER2 (+) cells are also not distributed evenly within
individual tumors. The sensitivity to chemotherapy differs
between different clones. Tumor cells that are HR (−) are
more sensitive to chemotherapy than HR (+) tumors, and
HR (+) cells, known as insensitive tumor cells [20–22], are
left behind as part of the residual disease after NCT [8, 23].
Likewise, Thor et al [24], Quddus et al [13] and Wang et al
[25] have documented that HER2 (+) tumor cells are more
likely to be eliminated by chemotherapy, and patients with
a high percentage of HER2-positive tumor cells showed
a good pathologic response. We  concluded that the
differential sensitivity to NCT caused by the heterogeneity

Previous studies have presented conflicting results
regarding the conversion of the HR status and the HER2
status of patients with breast cancer during NCT. While
several studies have suggested that the expression of these
receptors is altered after NCT [6–13], others indicated that
they remained stable [14–17]. Few prospective studies
have focused on the prognostic value of a discordant status.
In our prospective observational study, we demonstrated
that patients showing a conversion from HR (+) to HR (−)
in their residual tumors after NCT had a worst outcome
(with or without hormonal therapy) compared with other
types of HR conversions. The conversion of HER2 status
alone did not have a significant impact on the prognosis.
A switch to TN breast cancer was associated with a worse
outcome compared to that of patients with concordant TN
and discordant nTN (only significant for OS).

of clones inside individual tumors may account for the
change in HR from (−) to (+) and the change in HER2
from (+) to (−) after NCT.
Another known mechanism of HR status conversion
is the downregulation of the estrogenic hormone receptor
caused by NCT itself. Bines et al and Rose et al described
that chemotherapy can suppress ovarian function and
adrenal glands [26, 27], and the decrease in the circulating
levels of hormone caused by this suppression may alter the
HR status of residual tumors from (+) to (−) after NCT [8].
This mechanism is considered to be the main cause for the
switch of HR (+) to HR (−) after NCT. However, falsenegative identification of the HR status and the HER2
status in CNB due to intratumoral heterogeneity has been
reported previously [28]. The conversion from HR (−) to
HR (+) and HER2 (−) to HER2 (+) may be due to the
availability of tumor material for CNB because CNB may
represent only a small proportion of clones of different
phenotypes. Other explanations for the conversion
of receptor status include genetic mutations [29, 30],
statistical errors and staining techniques [12].
Our research highlighted the prognostic value of
the discordance in IHC status and tumor phenotype after
NCT using the Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression.
We assessed the expression of Ki67 in surgical specimens
and observed relatively high levels of Ki67 expression
in patients with loss of HR status and alteration to the
TN phenotype after NCT. Ki67 is known to be a cellular
proliferation marker [31, 32], and tumors with high
expression of Ki67 exhibit relatively more aggressive
behavior [6]. The poor outcome of patients associated
with the conversion of HR status and the switch to the
TN phenotype after NCT might be the result of a high
proportion of proliferating cancer cells and their biological
behavior.
Inevitably, our study has several limitations. First,
as a prospective observational study, but not a clinical
trial, the NCT regimens we used were not uniform. It is
not easy to determine whether the receptor conversion
is attributable to a special agent or to several ones.
Furthermore, our study design did not evaluate the
contribution of anti-HER2 therapy. Future studies will
be needed to validate the prognostic value of receptor
conversion in prospective cohorts. Finally, the molecular
mechanisms underlying receptor conversions are
uncertain.
In conclusion, our prospective observational
study demonstrated the existence of discordance in the
HR status and HER2 status after NCT and the negative
prognostic impact of the loss of receptor positivity. These
findings might help optimize the choice of sequential
adjuvant therapy and improve patient survival. The
administration of NCT might be the main reason for the
change in receptor status, but the mechanism needs to be
characterized. In the future, further studies are required to
identify the mechanism for this switch in receptor status
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

after NCT and to validate the prognostic impact associated
with this switch.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Case selection
This prospective observational study was initiated
in 2003. We enrolled patients who were diagnosed with
primary breast cancer and received NCT followed
by modified radical mastectomy at Fudan University
Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) between January 1,
2003 and December 31, 2009. Patients who had received
any type of treatment prior to NCT or who had metastatic
disease prior to surgery were not eligible for this study.
Cases of bilateral breast cancer, male breast cancer and
inflammatory breast cancer were also excluded. For each
participant, we collected pre-NCT CNB samples and
post-NCT surgical specimens. Out of the 544 patients,
we further excluded an additional 121 patients who were
considered to have pCR after NCT. In total, 423 eligible
patients with residual invasive tumors were included in
this prospective observational study.
Data on the medical history, patient characteristics
(including age, menopausal status, tumor size, tumor
status, node status, histologic type, HR status, HER2
status, Ki67 expression at surgery, tumor phenotype, NCT
regimens and cycles, response to NCT, vascular invasion,
histologic grade and adjuvant therapies), local and distant
extent of disease (evaluated by chest CT, bone scan,
abdominal ultrasound, bilateral mammography, breast
ultrasound or breast MRI), and pathological assessments
of morphological and biological features were collected.
CNB was performed to confirm the diagnosis of invasive
breast cancer prior to NCT and to evaluate the HR
and HER2 status. To minimize the influence of tumor
heterogeneity, at least two core samples were obtained in
each of the tumors.
All patients were followed up every three months
for the first year and every 6 months until death. Follow-up
was completed on December 31, 2013. The median length
of follow-up was 44 months (range, 2 to 149 months).
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of FUSCC, and each participant signed an informed
consent document.

Treatment
The patients in our study received an NCT regimen
consisting of NE (Navelbine and Epirubicin), CEF
(Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil),
TE (Docetaxel and Epirubicin), PC (Paclitaxel and
Carboplatin) or other agents for a median of 3 cycles
(range, 1–6 cycles). The pCR was defined as complete
disappearance of invasive carcinoma in the breast and
regional lymph nodes. The clinical response to NCT was
9608

Oncotarget

evaluated by physical and imaging examinations according
to RECIST 1.1. The clinical response was regarded as a
partial response (PR) if the reduction in the greatest tumor
diameter exceeded 30%. Tumor reduction of less than 30%
or an increase of up to 20% in the greatest diameter was
regarded as stable disease (SD). An increase of more than
20% in the greatest diameter of the tumor or the appearance
of new disease was regarded as disease progression (PD).
Mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were
performed within four weeks of the completion of NCT.
Additional cycles of chemotherapy, including anthracyclinebased and/or taxane-based regimens, were administered after
the surgery; a total of six to eight cycles of chemotherapy
were completed at the discretion of the treating physician
on the basis of clinical and pathologic evaluations after
surgery. Radiation therapy was offered at the discretion of
the treating radiation oncologist after completion of adjuvant
chemotherapy. Five-year standard endocrine therapy
(tamoxifen for premenopausal patients, aromatase inhibitor
for postmenopausal patients or sequential tamoxifen and
aromatase inhibitor) was administered to 190 patients
with HR (+) status pre- or post-NCT. Trastuzumab was
recommended for HER2 (+) patients in the adjuvant setting
but was not included in any pre-operative treatment.

log-rank test was used to test for differences between
groups. HazR and their 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated using the Cox regression model.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were
performed by adjusting for possible prognostic variables
(P < 0.05 in univariate analysis) using a stepwise
selection method. One-way ANOVA was used to evaluate
the differences in variables among multiple groups. The
Bonferroni test was performed when necessary. The
results were considered statistically significant if the P
was < 0.05. The statistical analysis was carried out using
SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS Company, Chicago, IL).

Pathology
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using
standard procedures for breast tumor specimens from CNB
and surgical resections. HR status and HER2 status were
evaluated before and after NCT, but the Ki67 index was
only available for surgical specimens. Each specimen was
examined independently by two experienced pathologists.
Data regarding the expression of HR and  HER2 were
collected from a database at the pathological center of
FUSCC. The cut-off value for ER positivity and PR
positivity was set at 1% of tumor cells with positive nuclear
staining. HER2 (+) status was defined as 3(+) according to
circumferential membrane-bound staining (HercepTest; Dako
Cytomation) or amplification confirmed by fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH). Ki67 expression was divided
into two groups: Ki67 index ≥ 15% (high expression) and
Ki67 index < 15% (low expression) [6]. The following
antibodies were used for IHC: ER (M7047, clone 1D5, Dako,
Produktionsvej, Glostrup, Denmark), PR (M3569, clone
PgR636, Dako), HER2 (A0485, polyclonal rabbit antibody,
Dako) and ­Ki-67 (M7240, clone MIB-1, Dako).
