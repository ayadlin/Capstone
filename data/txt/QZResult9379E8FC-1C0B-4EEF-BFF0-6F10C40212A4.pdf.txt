Ototoxicity and Cancer Therapy
Wendy Landier PhD, CRNP

Ototoxicity is a well-established toxicity associated with a subgroup of antineoplastic therapies that includes platinum chemotherapy, radiation or surgery involving the ear and auditory nerve, and supportive care agents such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and
loop diuretics. The reported prevalence of ototoxicity in patients who have received potentially ototoxic therapy ranges from 4% to
90% depending on factors such as age of the patient population, agent(s) used, cumulative dose, and administration techniques.
The impact of ototoxicity on subsequent health-related and psychosocial outcomes in these patients can be substantial, and the
burden of morbidity related to ototoxic agents is particularly high in very young children. Considerable interindividual variability in
the prevalence and severity of ototoxicity has been observed among patients receiving similar treatment, suggesting genetic susceptibility as a risk factor. The development and testing of otoprotective agents is ongoing; however, to the author’s knowledge, no
US Food and Drug Administration-approved otoprotectants are currently available. Prospective monitoring for ototoxicity allows
for comparison of auditory outcomes across clinical trials, as well as for early detection, potential alterations in therapy, and audiC 2016 Amertory intervention and rehabilitation to ameliorate the adverse consequences of hearing loss. Cancer 2016;122:1647-58. V

INTRODUCTION
Ototoxicity, manifesting as hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vertigo, is a well-established toxicity associated with a subgroup
of antineoplastic therapies that include platinum chemotherapy and radiation or surgery involving the ear and auditory
nerve. Supportive care agents, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and loop diuretics, also may contribute to ototoxicity in
patients with cancer. The impact of ototoxicity on subsequent health-related and social outcomes in these patients can be
substantial. Long-term effects may include permanent, severe to profound hearing loss or deafness, resulting in problems
with communication and social interaction, and impaired health-related quality of life. In young children, ototoxicity also
may significantly impair cognitive performance and the development of language and social skills.
Magnitude of the Problem

The reported prevalence of ototoxicity in patients who have received potentially ototoxic therapy ranges widely, from 4%
to 90%,1-7 depending on many factors, such as agent(s) used, age of the patient population, cumulative dose, and administration techniques. A summary of the recent literature reporting the prevalence of ototoxicity associated with various cancer populations is presented in Table 1.1-13 It is interesting to note that the burden of morbidity related to ototoxic agents
is substantially higher in very young children2,3,6,14 and in those who receive higher cumulative doses of ototoxic
agents.2,3,13,14 However, interindividual variability in the prevalence and severity of ototoxicity, even in these vulnerable
populations, suggests that genetic susceptibility also may play an important role.15-18
Mechanisms of Ototoxicity
Normal anatomy and physiology of the ear

The ears comprise 3 compartments known as the external, middle, and inner ears (Fig. 1). The external ear serves to
amplify and direct sound toward the middle ear, in which the ossicles transform the sound waves into mechanical energy,
which is transmitted to the inner ear. In the inner ear, sound is transmitted by hydraulic waves in the cochlea that stimulate
the sensory hair cells lining the organ of Corti, releasing neurotransmitters that cause the eighth cranial nerve to fire and
transmit the neural impulses through the brainstem to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain (Fig. 2).

Although the ears are fully formed at birth, maturation of
neuronal pathways and auditory structures continues during infancy and early childhood, making young children
particularly vulnerable to the ototoxic effects of cancer
therapies.
Radiation-related toxicity

Ototoxicity related to radiation involving the auditory
structures is multifactorial in nature (Fig. 1).19 Patients
receiving higher (30 grays) doses of radiation to the posterior nasopharynx and mastoid are at risk of developing
serous otitis media and associated conductive hearing
loss.20 Radiation involving the external auditory canal
may result in an increased susceptibility to soft-tissue
infections as well as excessive cerumen production and/or
dry cerumen that may require periodic removal.21 Radiation to the cochlea may lead to sensorineural hearing loss,
the exact mechanism of which is unknown to our knowledge, but which is believed to be related to direct damage
to cochlear apparatus or damage to small vessels resulting
in hypoxia involving inner ear structures; in addition,
radiation damage to the brainstem may indirectly contribute to hearing loss.21 Sensorineural hearing loss related to
radiation is generally permanent and progressive; the
onset may occur during the acute phase of treatment or be
delayed for several years after the completion of therapy.22
Chemotherapy-related and drug-related toxicity

reactive oxygen species within the cochlea, with resultant
destruction of cochlear hair cells and damage to the stria
vascularis and spiral ganglion cells.23 Cochlear hair cell
damage is generally dose-dependent,23 bilateral, and irreversible.6,24 Given the tonotopic arrangement of cochlear
hair cells,25 the initial insult begins at the base of the cochlea, in which high-frequency sounds are processed; additional drug exposure results in damage that progresses
toward the cochlear apex, in which the processing of lower
(speech frequency) sounds occurs.6,24 In young children,
the implications of even mild to moderate high-frequency
hearing loss are particularly detrimental because they are
generally in the process of acquiring language and communication skills at the time that hearing loss occurs, and
therefore are dependent on the high-frequency fricative
sounds (eg, “th,” “s”) that are critical for speech discrimination,26 which may be unintelligible to a child with
high-frequency hearing loss. Once the cochlear sensory
hair cells are destroyed, they cannot regenerate; therefore,
drug-related sensorineural hearing loss is almost always
bilateral and irreversible, and also can be accompanied by
tinnitus and vertigo.27 The ototoxicity of loop diuretics is
believed to be associated with shifts in fluid and electrolyte
concentrations in the inner ear, which may result in
edema of cochlear tissue and an associated decrease in
endocochlear potential.28 Hearing loss associated with
loop diuretics alone is generally transient28; however, the
administration of these agents concomitantly with platinum chemotherapy or aminoglycosides may potentiate
the ototoxic effects of these drugs.29,30

Figure 1. Anatomy of the ear. The etiology of ototoxicity related to cancer therapy is multifactorial and may affect the structures
of the external or middle ear (eg, radiation-related toxicity resulting in conductive hearing loss) or the inner ear/cochlea (eg,
toxicity related to platinum-based chemotherapy resulting in sensorineural hearing loss). Tumor growth or surgical resection also
can result in damage to auditory structures with resultant hearing loss.

Surgery-related toxicity

Risk Factors for Ototoxicity

Tumors located in or near the auditory structures or auditory nerve may cause damage by placing pressure on or
infiltrating auditory apparatus. Surgical resection has the
potential to result in further damage to the ear and auditory nerve.31 Patients with central nervous system
tumors may experience rapid changes in intracranial
pressure associated with lumbar puncture, tumor resection, or ventriculostomy, which are associated with hearing loss; these patients also often require temporary or
permanent shunting of cerebrospinal fluid, which is independently associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity (Fig. 3).32

Chemotherapy

1650

Platinum-based chemotherapy is widely used and particularly effective against solid tumors involving the head and
neck, lung, ovary, testicle, and bladder in adults.18 In children, platinum compounds are commonly used in the treatment of neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, hepatoblastoma,
germ cell and central nervous system tumors.33 The 3 major
platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin) differ with regard to their chemical structure and
adverse effect profiles. A major adverse effect associated with
cisplatin is irreversible sensorineural hearing loss.34 Younger

of a central nervous system tumor, diminished renal function, rapid intravenous administration, and treatment with

cisplatin, although the risk increases substantially when this

nasopharyngeal carcinoma.10 The effects of radiation to
the ear appear to be dose-related, with sensorineural hearing loss generally occurring at doses >30 grays.40,42 However, the risk of ototoxicity increases in patients who
require multimodality therapy, such as those receiving
both radiation and platinum-based chemotherapy.43,44

tumors involving essential components of the auditory
system46 and the surgical shunting of cerebrospinal fluid32
also may result in ototoxicity.
Other ototoxic agents

Additional agents with known ototoxic properties that are
commonly used during therapy for cancer include aminoglycoside antibiotics30 and loop diuretics28; risk increases
with elevated serum trough levels,47 rapid intravenous
administration,28 and the administration of loop diuretics
concurrent with or shortly after the administration of
aminoglycosides.30
Genetic predisposition

Considerable interindividual variability in the prevalence
and severity of ototoxicity has been observed among
patients receiving similar treatment with agents of known
ototoxic potential, with some patients remaining unaffected at high cumulative doses whereas others experience
severe damage at low doses.2,48,49 This interindividual variation is likely to be at least partially explained by genetic
susceptibility to the ototoxic effects of therapy.15,17 Candidate genes identified as being potentially involved in ototoxicity related to cancer therapy include megalin50 (a
transport protein), glutathione-S-transferase51 (GSTs;
involved in cellular detoxification), excision repair crosscomplementation groups 1 and 252,53 (ERCC1 and
ERCC2; involved in repairing drug-induced damage), acylphosphatase 254 (ACYP2; involved in calcium and magnesium transport), and mutations in mitochondrial genes55
(essential mediators for some apoptotic pathways); the
biologic association between ototoxicity and variants in thi1652

opurine S-methyltranferase (TPMT) and catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT) are less clear.15,27 In what to
the author’s knowledge is the small body of genetic association studies of ototoxicity in cancer therapeutics published
to date, genetic variants in TPMT, COMT, and ACYP2
have been associated with platinum-related hearing loss in
children,49,54 variants of the megalin gene have been associated with platinum-related hearing loss in adults,50 mitochondrial mutations have been associated with
aminoglycoside ototoxicity,55 variants in GSTP1 have been
associated with increased susceptibility to radiation-related
hearing loss in children,56 and conflicting results have been
noted regarding associations between GSTs and platinumrelated hearing loss.51,57 A summary of candidate genes
potentially involved in ototoxicity related to cancer therapy
is presented in Table 2.49-58
Detection of Ototoxicity
Types of testing

Given the substantial risk of ototoxicity associated with
platinum chemotherapy and radiation involving the ear
and auditory nerve, prospective auditory evaluations to
allow for the early detection of hearing loss are indicated
for patients receiving therapy with ototoxic potential.
Pure-tone audiometry is the standard method used for
hearing assessments,59 and generally involves the presentation of sounds across a wide range of frequencies (ie, low
to high pitches, generally 500 to 8000 Hertz at minimum). Each sound is presented at increasing intensity (ie,
loudness, measured in decibels) until the patient is able to
hear it. The lowest level of intensity at which the patient
can first hear a sound at a given frequency approximately
50% of the time is considered the “pure-tone threshold;”
a normal pure-tone threshold is  20 decibels.60 Threshold shifts in patients with sensorineural hearing loss typically begin in the high-frequency range (>4000 Hertz),
and generally progress to the lower frequencies in a stairstep pattern over time with continued exposure to the ototoxic agent (Fig. 4).61 The majority of patients aged >5
years are able to complete conventional pure-tone audiometric testing in an acoustically treated (sound-attenuating) test booth. The technique can be adapted for younger
children using play (for those aged 3-5 years) or visual
reinforcement (for those aged 9-36 months) techniques.62
Patients who are too young or unable to cooperate
with behavioral testing can be assessed using electrophysiologic techniques, such as brainstem auditory-evoked
response.59 In addition, distortion product otoacoustic
emissions are objective, noninvasive measures that do not
require the child’s active participation and may be more

and refining these guidelines, particularly for young children.15,59 For older patients, less frequent testing may be
indicated; however, all patients receiving potentially ototoxic therapy should undergo auditory testing at baseline
and at the completion of therapy, at minimum, to determine whether auditory intervention or rehabilitation is
indicated.

sensitive to initial changes in auditory function than conventional auditory testing.63,64
Frequency of testing

The frequency of auditory testing indicated for an individual patient depends on several factors, including age,
planned therapy with potentially ototoxic agents, and personal risk profile. Because young children are at the highest risk of sustaining both ototoxicity and its related
adverse outcomes (ie, delays in linguistic development
and poor psychosocial and cognitive outcomes), baseline
and ongoing auditory monitoring (ie, before initial platinum dose and every 1-2 courses of platinum-based chemotherapy) is often recommended for children to allow for
early detection, auditory intervention, and, when possible,
modification of ototoxic therapy. Clinical practice guidelines for patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy
Cancer

June 1, 2016

Monitoring for ototoxicity after the completion of cancer
therapy is recommended in several standardized longterm follow-up guidelines.67-69 For patients with a history
of treatment with platinum chemotherapy, an auditory
assessment is generally recommended at the baseline longterm follow-up visit (usually  2 years after the completion of cancer therapy) and then as clinically indicated.
For patients who have received radiotherapy to the head
or ear, ongoing audiologic monitoring every 5 years (or
more frequently if clinically indicated) is advised due to
the potential for progression of hearing loss over time.22
Grading/classification of hearing loss

Several ototoxicity grading systems are currently in use
(Table 3).15,61,65,70-73 Due to significant variability
between grading scales,2,15 efforts are currently underway
to develop expert consensus regarding a uniform ototoxicity grading method.15 The accurate classification of hearing loss has implications for both the clinical management
of patients and for the evaluation and comparison of
audiologic outcomes on clinical trials.59 Across most
scales, hearing loss is assigned a grade ranging from 0 (normal hearing, or clinically insignificant loss) to 4 (severe or
profound hearing loss); however, there is significant

scales, and some scales are designed for use in children
whereas others are designed for use in adult populations.2,15,59,61,65,71,73 In addition, there are classification
systems designed to detect early ototoxicity3 that designate hearing solely as “normal” versus “impaired,” without assigning a severity grade.59
Management of Ototoxicity
Hearing aids

Hearing aids are a crucial component of the management
of significant hearing loss in both children and adults;
1654

however, it is important to understand that although hearing aids amplify sound, they do not restore normal hearing. Thus, in patients requiring hearing aids, hearing
quality will remain distorted to some extent, resulting in a
reduced ability to discriminate speech in noisy environments. The daily use and care of hearing aids, particularly
in young children, also can be challenging.74 Nevertheless, there are many types and models of hearing aids available, including behind-the-ear, in-the-ear, and in-thecanal models, and continued improvements in digital
technology have resulted in increased programmability

Approach

Benefits

Hearing aids

Cochlear implants

Assistive devices
(eg, auditory trainers,
telephone amplifiers,
audio streamers, use
of text messaging and
social media)
Special accommodations

Amplification of sound; numerous models and
features available; increased programmability
and advanced speech processing in newer
models
Direct stimulation of auditory neural pathway in the
cochlea provides a pathway for the
transmission of sound to the brain in patients
with severely damaged sensory hair cells
Provide augmentation to hearing aids or
supplementary communication; particularly
useful in noisy environments

Hearing quality remains distorted to some extent;
reduced ability to discriminate speech in noisy
environments; daily care required

Provision of specialized services at public
expense; particularly helpful for children,
adolescents, and young adults attending
school; free of charge to the patient/family

Requires awareness of applicable laws and
completion of appropriate applications and
evaluative procedures; often requires
reevaluation and renewal of service
authorizations on an annual basis

Cochlear implants

In patients with severe to profound hearing loss who are
unable to benefit from hearing aids, a cochlear implant
may provide significant benefit.76 Cochlear implants are
surgically placed devices that directly stimulate auditory
neural pathways in the cochlea. By circumventing the
damaged sensory hair cells, cochlear implants provide a
pathway for the transmission of sound waves to the
brain.77 Hybrid cochlear implants are specifically
designed for patients with severe to profound hearing loss
limited to the high frequencies and combine both acoustic
and electrical stimulation; these hybrid implants may be
particularly useful in adults with steeply sloping highfrequency sensorineural hearing loss typically noted after
exposure to ototoxic agents.78
Assistive devices

In addition to hearing aids, devices such as auditory trainers, telephone amplifiers, telephone devices for the deaf,
audio streamers, and more recently, the wide availability
of text messaging and social media provide alternate communication methods for patients with severe hearing
loss.79 These assistive devices can be used with compatible
hearing aids in difficult listening environments to
improve the delivery of sound directly to the affected
patient.
Special accommodations

Hearing loss is generally recognized as a disability under
the law. For example, in the United States, 2 public laws,

Limitations

Requires ongoing audiology and speech therapy
rehabilitation program

Some devices must be compatible with the
particular model of hearing aid; devices may
become outdated and need to be replaced as
technologies continue to rapidly evolve

Education Act Amendments of 1997, and related provisions in “Part B” of this law)80 and Public Law 101-336
(Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990), provide for
equal access and free and appropriate public education for
those with special needs such as hearing loss. This includes
the provision of specialized services and devices, provided
at public expense.81
A summary of approaches to the management of
ototoxicity is presented in Table 4.
Prevention of Ototoxicity
Monitoring during treatment

Implementation of standardized audiologic monitoring
protocols has the potential to allow for the early detection
of ototoxicity in patients receiving therapy for cancer, and
thus also may provide an opportunity for treatment modification, if possible, before auditory damage becomes
severe. Even when no reasonable alternative is available
and therapy with the ototoxic agent must continue, monitoring may still be of value in allowing for early intervention and auditory rehabilitation.
Otoprotective agents

Much preclinical work has been done to develop otoprotective agents, some of which have moved into clinical
studies. Trials of amifostine, an antioxidant, in children
receiving cisplatin for hepatoblastoma82 and germ cell
tumors83 failed to demonstrate otoprotection; however, a
more recent trial of amifostine in children with medulloblastoma demonstrated otoprotection in those with
average-risk but not high-risk disease.84 Several clinical
1655

Review Article

trials evaluating additional agents, including sodium thiosulfate, another antioxidant, currently are ongoing.
Because the mechanism of platinum-related cytotoxicity
to normal tissues, including the cochlea, may be similar to
the platinum-related cytotoxicity aimed at the tumor cells
(ie, interaction with nuclear DNA), the potential for otoprotectant interference with the efficacy of the chemotherapy has been raised as a concern.27 To the author’s
knowledge to date, there are no otoprotectants approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration that currently
are available for use in pediatric or adult oncology.27
Identification of patients at highest risk

Risk-prediction models for platinum-related ototoxicity,
based on age and cumulative dose, have been developed14;
however, these models do not accurately predict risk for
individual patients.27 Although there currently is not sufficient evidence to identify genetic predictors of susceptibility to ototoxicity before the implementation of therapy,
continued progress is being made in ototoxicity-related
pharmacogenomics, making the prospect of personalized
therapy based on the identification of high-risk genotypes
a future possibility for the prevention of ototoxicity.
Conclusions

Ototoxicity is a serious consequence associated with several agents commonly used in contemporary cancer therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy, radiation
and surgery involving the ear, and supportive care drugs
including aminoglycoside antibiotics and loop diuretics.
Progress has been made toward the early identification of
ototoxicity, and rehabilitative strategies are available to
help ameliorate the associated adverse social and educational consequences. Progress is also being made toward
the identification of those individuals at highest risk of
developing toxicity as a result of genetic susceptibility, as
well as the development of otoprotective agents to diminish toxicities associated with current regimens. Future
directions include the development of reliable profiles to
identify at-risk individuals, and the implementation of
personalized strategies such as the use of otoprotective
agents or avoidance of ototoxic drugs in susceptible individuals to decrease the prevalence of ototoxicity and
improve health-related quality of life in these patients.
