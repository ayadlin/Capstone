Abstract
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most commonly used
anticancer drugs in chemotherapy against various solid
tumors. 5-FU dose-dependently increased the expression levels
of intrinsic antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)
in human colon carcinoma KM12C cells and human breast
cancer MCF7 cells. We investigated the molecular basis for the
induction of TSP-1 by 5-FU in KM12C cells. Promoter assays
showed that the region with the Egr-1 binding site is critical
for the induction of TSP-1 promoter activity by 5-FU. The
binding of Egr-1 to the TSP-1 promoter was increased in
KM12C cells treated with 5-FU. Immunofluorescence staining
revealed that 5-FU significantly increased the level of Egr-1 in
the nuclei of KM12C cells. The suppression of Egr-1 expression
by small interfering RNA decreased the expression level of
TSP-1. Furthermore, 5-FU induced the phosphorylation of p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and heat shock
protein 27 (HSP27). Blockade of the p38 MAPK pathway by
SB203580 remarkably inhibited the phosphorylation of HSP27
induced by 5-FU and decreased the induction of Egr-1 and
TSP-1 by 5-FU in KM12C cells. These findings suggest that the
p38 MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in the induction of
Egr-1 by 5-FU and that induced Egr-1 augments TSP-1
promoter activity, with the subsequent production of TSP-1
mRNA and protein. [Cancer Res 2008;68(17):7035–41]

Introduction
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly used anticancer drug in
chemotherapy against various solid tumors (1). Recent clinical
studies have shown that UFT (a prodrug of 5-FU, Tegafur,
combined with uracil in a 1:4 molar ratio) is an active oral
chemotherapeutic agent in postoperative adjuvant settings for
completely resected early-stage lung, gastric, colorectal, and breast
cancer that does not exhibit any remarkable toxicity (2). UFT can
achieve a higher maximum plasma 5-FU level for a longer period
by inhibiting 5-FU degradation, thereby enhancing its antitumor

effect (3). Angiogenesis is an important therapeutic target for a
variety of malignant tumors. UFT-containing long-term chemotherapy significantly improved patient survival (4). The antiangiogenic effect of UFT might contribute, at least in part, to its clinical
efficacy. Recently, we examined the antitumor and antiangiogenesis activities of the 5-FU–based drug, S-1 (1 mol/L teagaful,
0.4 mol/L 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine, and 1mol/L potassium
oxonate), at a sub–maximum tolerated dose (sub-MTD) on human
colorectal cancer xenografts. The up-regulation of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), as well as down-regulation of microvessel
formation, has been shown (5). However, the molecular basis for
the suppression of angiogenesis by 5-FU has not been fully
elucidated (6).
TSP-1 has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis by inhibiting
endothelial cell migration, inducing endothelial cell apoptosis,
directly interacting with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
and inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 activation (7). In
addition, TSP-1 may inhibit angiogenesis by decreasing the level
of circulating endothelial cell progenitors (8). However, the
molecular basis for TSP-1 induction by 5-FU and other anticancer
agents is unknown (9).
In the present study, we found that 5-FU induced TSP-1 in
human colon carcinoma KM12C cells. A transcription factor, Egr-1,
was also induced by 5-FU and bound to the promoter of TSP-1,
enhancing its transcription and the subsequent production of
TSP-1 protein. Moreover, we present the evidence that p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays an important role
in 5-FU–induced Egr-1 transactivation.

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA (2 Ag) was reversetranscribed using a ReverTra Ace kit (Toyobo).
Reverse transcription–PCR. The expression levels of Egr-1 and TSP-1
were detected using reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR). Primer sequences
are given in Supplementary Table S1.
Real-time RT-PCR quantification. Expression levels of TSP-1 and Egr-1
were determined using real-time PCR (PRISM 7900HT, Applied Biosystems),
according to the manufacture’s protocol. The sets of primers and TaqMan
probes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), TSP-1 and
Egr-1 (4310884E, Hs00170236, and Hs00152928, respectively) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Human GAPDH was used for normalization. Target gene expression was quantified using the comparative cycle
threshold method, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Protein extraction and immunoblotting. KM12C and LOVO cells were
plated at a density of 1  106 per well in a six-well plate and were treated for
4 d in the absence or presence of 5-FU (0.5 and 1 Amol/L). The cells were

harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
25 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2 Ag/mL aprotinin,
0.5 mmol/L (p -amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L
DTT, and 2 Ag/mL leupeptin]. After lysis, the cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 14,000  g for 15 min at 4jC.
The proteins in the whole cell lysate (200 Ag) were separated using SDSPAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane and reacted with primary antibodies against TSP-1,
Egr-1, phosphorylated HSP27, a-tubulin, and HSP27. After incubation,
membranes were washed and incubated with antimouse or antirabbit
secondary antibodies (GE Health Science). The membranes were developed
using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham
Biosciences).
Inhibition of Egr-1 expression by Egr-1 small interfering RNA. Egr1–specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Transfections (40 nmol/L Egr-1 siRNA) were accomplished
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. As a control, the cells were treated with an equal amount of GFP
(eGFP) siRNA (Ambion). After transfection, the cells were exposed to 5-FU
(1 and 2 Amol/L) for 5 d and then harvested, and the effect of the siRNA on
the expression of TSP-1 and Egr-1 was assessed using real-time PCR,
RT-PCR, and immunoblotting, as described above.
TSP-1 promoter-reporter constructs. Three deletion mutants of pGL3TSP-1, namely ( 1,210/+750), ( 267/+750), and ( 71/+750), were prepared
as described previously (10).
The pGL3–TSP-1 ( 2,033/+750) plasmid was constructed as follows. The
TSP-1 promoter, ranging from 2,033 to +750, was amplified using PCR with
KOD plus polymerase (Toyobo) from the genomic DNA of KM12C cells using
a sense primer (5¶-CGGCTAGCCGTCTGCAGAGGCATTCCTACAATCCCTACAATCCCTCAGC-3¶) and an antisense primer (5¶-CCGCTCGAGATCCTGTAGCAGGAAGCACAAGAGCCGAGG-3¶). These primers contained an NheI
or an XhoI site at the 5¶ end, respectively.
The pGL3–TSP-1 ( 2,033/+750 DEgr-1) plasmid was derived from pGL3–
TSP-1 ( 2,033/+750) plasmid, deleting the StyI-NotI region, including the
Egr-1 binding site.
Transient transfection and dual luciferase reporter assay. KM12C
cells were plated at a density of 1  105 per well in 24-well plates and
pretreated with various concentrations of 5-FU for 3 d before transfection.
Transfection and dual-luciferase assay were performed as described
previously (11).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Cells treated with 5-FU, as
described above, were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37jC to
cross-link protein to DNA. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
was carried out using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The soluble DNA fraction was mixed with
an anti–Egr-1 antibody or nonimmunized mouse IgG (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and the precipitated DNA was amplified with primers
for the TSP-1 promoter [5¶-AACGAATGGCTCTCTTGGTGT-3¶ (sense) and
5¶-CTTTCCAGCTAGAAAGTAAG -3¶ (antisense)].
Confocal fluorescence microscopy. KM12C cells (7.5  104) were
cultured in the medium with or without 2 Amol/L 5-FU for 5 d on
coverslips, fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room
temperature, and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 10 min. Cells were
incubated with an antibody against Egr-1 at 4jC overnight. After washing
thrice in PBS, the cells were incubated with 200-fold diluted Alexa Fluor
546–labeled antirabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained by incubating
cells with 6 Amol/L 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The cells were
observed using confocal flurorescence microscopy (FV500, Olympus
Corporation).
Statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons were performed using
the Student’s t test. Quantitative data were expressed as the means F SD.
P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Induction of TSP-1 by 5-FU in KM12C cells

5-FU–based drug, S-1, at sub-MTD concentration has antiangiogenic function through up-regulation of TSP-1 in colorectal cancer
xenografts (5). To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the
specificity of this effect, human colon cancer cells were treated
with 5-FU at concentrations near or below IC50 for 4 days
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The expression of TSP-1 in two human
colon cancer cell lines was then determined by immunoblot
analysis using an antibody against TSP-1. When KM12C and LOVO
cells were treated with 5-FU at 1 Amol/L, the expression levels of
TSP-1 were 3-fold and 2-fold increased, compared with counterpart
untreated cells, respectively (Fig. 1A and B). Meanwhile, treatment
of the cells with 10 Amol/L 5-FU for 1 day also increased the
expression of TSP-1 protein in KM12C cells (data not shown).
In this study, we focused on the molecular basis for the induction
of TSP-1 by low-dose 5-FU. Because the TSP-1 protein level in
KM12C cells treated with 5-FU was considerably higher than that
in 5-FU–treated LOVO cells, we used KM12C cells for further study.

the cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were further incubated with or

determined. The luciferase activities were corrected for differences in
transfection efficiency among wells, as estimated using the Renilla luciferase
activities. Columns, representative of triplicate independent experiments; bars,

KM12C cells were treated with 5-FU at 1 and 2 Amol/L for 1, 3, and 5 d. The cells
were fixed with formaldehyde to form a DNA-protein complex and were
subjected to a ChIP assay, as described in the Materials and Methods. PCR for
the core promoter region of the TSP-1 gene was performed using DNA
extracted from the DNA-protein complex immunoprecipitated using an anti–Egr-1
antibody or nonimmune IgG.

Effect of 5-FU on the expression of the TSP-1 gene in KM12C
cells. The levels of TSP-1 mRNA in KM12C cells incubated in
the absence or presence of 5-FU were determined using realtime RT-PCR. Treatment of the KM12C cells with 5-FU at 1 and
2 Amol/L for 1, 3, and 5 days increased the TSP-1 mRNA levels in a
dose-dependent and time-dependent manner compared with those
in untreated cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the expression level of
TSP-1 mRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated
with 5-FU was f2-fold higher than in the untreated cells (data not
shown). These data suggested that 5-FU enhanced TSP-1 protein
expression in both cancer and endothelial cells by activating
transcription of TSP-1 gene.
Identification of the transcriptional regulatory element
necessary for transcriptional activation of the TSP-1 gene by
5-FU. To investigate which transcriptional regulatory elements in
the TSP-1 promoter contribute to the transcriptional activation of
the TSP-1 gene by 5-FU, we made wild-type and various deletion
constructs of the TSP-1 promoter (Fig. 2A). The 5¶-flanking region
up to 2,033 from the transcription initiation site contained
several putative binding sites for known transcription factors,
including an Egr-1 site and Sp-1 sites (GC boxes; Fig. 2A). The
longest construct ( 2,033/+750) showed the highest promoter
activity among the constructs in the cells treated with 5-FU, and
the activity was considerably decreased when the constructs lacked
the region including both the Egr-1 and Sp-1 binding sites (Fig. 2B).
These findings suggested that Egr-1 or Sp-1 transcription factors
might enhance the expression of the TSP-1 gene.
TSP-1 promoter and its in vivo Egr-1 recruitment. DNAdamaging agents can up-regulate the expression of the tumor
suppressor gene Egr-1 in both normal and cancer cells (12),
whereas Sp-1 plays a role in the EGF-induced activation of the
TSP-1 gene (10). We thus focused our study on Egr-1. To confirm
the recruitment of Egr-1 to the TSP-1 promoter in vivo, a ChIP
assay was performed (Fig. 2C). The Egr-1 recruitment was dosedependently and time-dependently enhanced by 5-FU in KM12C
cells. This enhancement was hardly detected when nonimmune
IgG was used (Fig. 2C, bottom). These results indicated the
enhanced binding of Egr-1 to the TSP-1 promoter in cells treated
with 5-FU.
Effect of 5-FU on Egr-1 expression in KM12C cells. The
expression of Egr-1 mRNA was also verified using RT-PCR and
real-time PCR (Fig. 3). It was dose-dependently and timedependently increased by 5-FU (Fig. 3A and B). To identify the
subcellular localization of Egr-1 induced by 5-FU, Egr-1 was
observed using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Egr-1 was
mainly localized in the nuclei of KM12C cells treated with 5-FU
but was not detected in the control cells (Fig. 3C).
Effect of Egr-1 knockdown on the induction of TSP-1 by
5-FU. To confirm that Egr-1 is involved in the enhanced expression
of TSP-1 by 5-FU, Egr-1 siRNAs were used to knockdown the
expression of Egr-1. The induction of Egr-1 mRNA and protein
expression by 5-FU was considerably suppressed by Egr-1 siRNA,
but not by GFP siRNA. Egr-1 knockdown resulted in the decreased
expression of TSP-1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 4A–D). These results
show that Egr-1 is required for the 5-FU–mediated induction of
TSP-1.
To examine whether Egr-1 is required for the 5-FU–mediated
induction of TSP-1 in other tumor cells, we determined the
expression levels of Egr-1 and TSP-1 in MCF7 cells. When MCF7
cells were treated with 1 and 2 Amol/L 5-FU at concentrations
near IC50 (Supplementary Fig. S2A), the expressions of Egr-1 and

expression levels of Egr-1 mRNA in KM12C cells

localization of Egr-1 was analyzed using confocal

with 2 Amol/L 5-FU for 5 d and stained with DAPI
(blue ) and an anti–Egr-1 antibody (green ). Top,
KM12C cells treated with 2 Amol/L 5-FU; bottom,

TSP-1 were also increased compared with those of untreated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B–D). TSP-1 protein levels in the
5-FU–treated MCF7 cells were suppressed when Egr-1 was
down-regulated by Egr-1 siRNA (data not shown). These results
suggest that our findings are not limited to KM12C cells.
Effect of 5-FU on the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway.
Several studies have indicated the activation of one or more
members of the MAPK family of intracellular signaling kinases by
cytotoxic agents (13). Among them, p38 often transmits the signal
generated by diverse stimuli (14). The p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580 attenuated the TSP-1 up-regulation induced by trastuzumab and transforming growth factor-h1 (TGF-h1; refs. 10, 15).
We thus focused our study on p38 MAPK. To examine whether
5-FU is involved in the activation of the MAPK pathways, the effect
of 5-FU on the phosphorylation of proteins involved in p38 MAPK
pathways was studied. The treatment of KM12C cells with 1 and
2 Amol/L 5-FU for 5 days increased the phosphorylation of p38,
whereas the expression level of p38 remained unchanged (Fig. 5A).
This indicated that the p38 MAPK pathway is activated by 5-FU.
Effect of p38 MAPK inhibitor on 5-FU–induced Egr-1 and
TSP-1 expression. To confirm that the activation of p38 MAPK
contributes to 5-FU–induced Egr-1 and TSP-1 expression, we
examined the effect of a p38 MAPK inhibitor on the expression of
Egr-1 and TSP-1. As shown in Fig. 5, the p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580 remarkably suppressed the expression of Egr-1, TSP-1
mRNA, and Egr-1 (Fig. 5B–D). The p38 MAPK signaling pathway

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

might play an important role in the 5-FU–induced expression of
Egr-1 and TSP-1 in KM12C cells. In accordance with these findings,
SB203580 attenuated the 5-FU–induced phosphorylation of HSP27,
one of the downstream molecules of p38 MAPK. However, it had no
effect on 5-FU–induced HSP27 expression (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Previous studies indicated that TSP-1 induced by low-dose
cyclophosphamide is implicated in the suppression of tumor
growth (16). Furthermore, our recent study showed that
5-FU–based drugs have antitumor function partially through
up-regulation of TSP-1 in colorectal cancer xenografts (5). In
accordance with these results, we also found that 5-FU enhanced
the expression of TSP-1 in human colon cancer (KM12C and
LOVO cells) and breast cancer MCF7 cells (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S2B and D). The expression level of TSP-1
mRNA in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell was also
increased by 5-FU (data not shown). Various extracellular stimuli
and compounds altered TSP-1 gene expression (17). It is generally
accepted that TSP-1 expression levels are tightly regulated at
the transcriptional level. Donoviel and colleagues (18) identified
the TSP-1 promoter region and found that the 5¶-flanking region
between 234 and +750 was important for the basal transcriptional activity (19). The promoter region of mouse TSP-1 contains
one Egr-1 binding site, and TSP-1 transcription is enhanced by

Egr-1 (20). In human hepatic HuH-7 cells, the TSP-1 promoter
region between 267 and 71 contained two GC boxes to which
Sp-1 bound. These boxes were found to be responsible for the
promoter activity enhanced by EGF (10). Consistent with these

studies, we also showed that TSP-1 promoter region ( 267/ 71)
is needed for the augmentation TSP-1 promoter activity by 5-FU,
and the deletion of the region in which the Egr-1 and SP-1
binding sites reside almost completely blocked the TSP-1

the p38 MAP kinase pathway, leading to the increased expression of Egr-1.
Egr-1 binds to the promoter of TSP-1 and enhances the transcription of the
TSP-1 gene and subsequently the expression of Egr-1.

promoter activity (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the increased binding of
Egr-1 to the TSP-1 promoter in cells treated with 5-FU was also
observed (Fig. 2C).
Egr-1 is a Cys2-His2–type zinc-finger transcription factor and
binds to GC-rich, cis-acting promoter elements, controlling the
expression of a wide variety of pathogenesis-relevant genes,
encoding growth factors, cytokines, receptors, adhesion molecules,
and proteases, many of which are involved in angiogenesis,
tumorigenesis (21), the response to ischemia (22), and the progress
of several vascular diseases (23). A number of reports also indicate
that Egr-1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Egr-1 is downregulated in several types of neoplasia, as well as an array of tumor
cell lines. Egr-1 is induced very early in the apoptotic process,
where it mediates the activation of downstream regulators, such as
p53 (24). Egr-1 also activates phosphatase and tensin homologue
tumor suppressor gene during UV irradiation (25), suppressing the
growth of transformed cells in both soft agar and athymic nude
mice (26). Sustained Egr-1 expression may cause the induction of
multiple pathways of antiangiogenesis, growth arrest, and apoptosis induction in proliferating cells leading to preferential inhibition
of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Egr-1 possesses a strong
inhibitory effect on the angiogenic activity of VEGF in vivo (27).
Our results showed that Egr-1 induced by 5-FU was needed for the
increased expression of TSP-1 in KM12C cells treated with 5-FU
(Figs. 3 and 4).
MAPK pathways have been implicated in the response to
chemotherapeutic drugs (28). c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and p38
kinase are important for controlling cell growth and apoptosis in
response to chemical stress, radiation, and growth factors (29). Our
results showed that 5-FU activated p38 MAPK (Fig. 5A). Activated

p38 MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP kinase 2, which in turn
phosphorylates HSP27 (30). SB203580 attenuated the 5-FU–
enhanced phosphorylation of HSP27, indicating that SB203580
effectively inhibited the activation of p38 pathway in 5-FU–treated
KM12C cells. SB203580 suppressed the expression of both Egr-1
and TSP-1 mRNAs, suggesting that the activation of the p38 MAPK
pathway by 5-FU is responsible for the induction of Egr-1 and
TSP-1 (Fig. 5B–D). Trastuzumab also stimulated sustained p38
activation, and SB203580 attenuated the TSP-1 up-regulation
induced by trastuzumab (15). SB203580 partially inhibited TGFh1–induced TSP-1 expression (10). These findings suggest that the
activation of p38 MAPK plays an important role in the induction of
TSP-1 by some anticancer agents and growth factors. Further study
is needed to determine the detailed mechanisms underlying the
regulation of the p38 MAPK pathway by 5-FU.
Several transcription factors are regulated by p38 MAPK, and
this kinase is involved in the control of the expression of various
genes. In vitro studies show that the transcription factor ATF2 is
phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPK. In addition, p38
MAPK activates the Elk-1, CHOP, MEF2C, and SAP-1 transcription
factors (31). Our finding that 5-FU activated p38 MAPK and then
increased the expression of Egr-1 may be useful for elucidating the
molecular basis for the chemopreventive and antitumor effects of
5-FU and its prodrugs.
HSP27 is a molecular chaperone that is constitutively expressed
in several mammalian cells, particularly during pathologic
conditions. This protein protects cells against toxicity mediated
by aberrantly folded proteins or oxidative inflammatory conditions.
In addition, this protein has antiapoptotic properties and is
tumorigenic when expressed in cancer cells (32). Some anticancer
agents, particularly cisplatin (33), vincristine, and colchicines (34),
also enhanced HSP27 expression. It is as yet unknown whether the
induced HSP27 affects the antitumor activity of these anticancer
agents.
A schematic representation of a proposed molecular basis for
the up-regulation of TSP-1 by 5-FU in KM12C cells is shown in
Fig. 6. Our findings show that 5-FU activated p38 MAPK and then
up-regulated Egr-1 expression, resulting in the expression of an
endogeneous antiangiogenic factor, TSP-1. Recently, we have
found that the expression of VEGF mRNA was suppressed by
5-FU using Genechip analysis (11). VEGF is produced in varying
quantities in tumors and seems to be an important modulator of
TSP function. Relative ratios of TSPs to VEGF might determine
whether vessels regress or proliferate (17). Further study is
needed to elucidate whether TSP-1 induced by 5-FU is involved in
the antitumor effect of 5-FU. A better understanding about the
mechanisms of the antiangiogenic and the antitumor effect of
5-FU might provide new approaches for the treatment of colon
and breast cancers.
