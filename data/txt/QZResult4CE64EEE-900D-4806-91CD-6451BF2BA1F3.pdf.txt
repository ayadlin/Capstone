ABSTRACT
Objectives
Mucosal melanomas (MM) are aggressive subtypes of common melanomas. It
remains unclear whether limitations in their resectability or their distinctive molecular
mechanisms are responsible for the aggressive phenotype.
Methods
In total, 112 patients with cutaneous melanomas (CM) and 27 patients with MM
were included. Clinical parameters were analysed using Chi square, Fisher exact and
student’s t-test. Survival rates were calculated by Kaplan–Meier. Analysis of p53,
p21, Mdm2, Hipk2, Gadd45, Puma, Bax, Casp9 and Cdk1 via quantitative PCR and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. TP53 induction after cisplatin treatment
was analysed in 10 cell lines (melanocytes, four MM and five CM) using western blot
(WB) and qPCR.
Results
The overall/recurrence-free survival differed significantly between MM (40
months and 30 months) and CM (90 months and 107 months; p < 0.001). IHC and
WB confirmed high p53 expression in all melanomas. Hipk2 and Gadd45 showed
significantly higher expressions in CM (p < 0.005; p = 0.004). QPCR and WB of wildtype cell lines demonstrated no differences for p53, p21, Mdm2, Bax and Casp9. WB
failed to detect Puma in MM, while Cdk1 regulation occurred exclusively in MM.
Conclusions
The aggressive phenotype of MM did not appear to be due to differential
expressions of p53, p21, Mdm2, Bax or Casp9. A non-functional apoptosis in MM may
have further clinical implications.

INTRODUCTION

We give a detailed assessment of the clinical
characteristics of 139 patients with malignant melanoma
of the head and neck, including 112 CM and 27 MM.
To investigate whether or not the aggressive phenotype
in MM is due to an aberrant p53 pathway we analysed
the protein and mRNA expression of p53 and its targets.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples
of 40 patients with head and neck CM and MM were
differentially analysed using immunohistochemistry and
real-time (RT-) PCR (qPCR). Furthermore, we investigated
the functional integrity of p53 in CM and MM melanoma
cell cultures by cisplatin incubation. Experimental data
was put into clinical context.

In Europe, 18 of 100,000 people are annually
diagnosed with malignant melanoma, and the incidence
is continuously increasing. Earlier detection by intensive
clinical efforts have led to an enhanced five-year survival
rate of 89%–94% [1]. Mucosal melanomas represent an
infrequent subtype representing 1% of the overall cohort
[2]. The majority of MM originates in the sinonasal region.
Other tumour sites such as the oral cavity, uvea, or the
urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts occur infrequently [3].
In contrast to their cutaneous counterparts, MM present a
highly aggressive subtype with a poor five-year survival rate
of approximately 17% [4]. The sinonasal region is a difficult
site to access surgically, often preventing a radical surgical
approach with sufficient R-status. Therefore, locoregional
recurrent disease might be a possible explanation for
the limited survival. Molecular mechanisms underlying
the highly aggressive phenotype remain unclear. While the
aetiology of MM is still unclear, molecular changes that
may contribute to tumour development in CM are widely
discussed [5–10]. While TP53 is mutated in many solid
tumours, mutations in CM and MM are rare [11]. However,
accumulation of wild-type p53 can be detected in the
majority of CM and MM. The mechanisms explaining the
p53 protein stabilisation remain unclear. Mutations in p53modifying proteins Mdm2 (mouse double minute 2) and
Hipk2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) can be
excluded [12]. Cellular stress, such as damage induced by
UV light and cytotoxic agents, leads to p53 stabilisation by
blocking its degradation through Mdm2 and posttranslational
modifications [13]. Once p53 is activated, it functions as a
transcription factor in the expression of a broad variety of
target genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair
and apoptosis [14]. MDM2 is a direct target gene, which
mediates p53 degradation. Under stress conditions, this
feedback loop is inhibited by phosphorylation of p53 on
Thr18 through Ck1 (casein kinase 1) thereby disrupting
Mdm2-p53 binding [15]. Stabilised and activated p53 can
induce cell cycle arrest by enhancing the expression of p21
which itself inhibits Cdk1 (cyclin dependent kinase 1) and
other Cdks, decelerating cell cycle progression [16]. The
influence of p53 in DNA repair was explored by inducing
the expression of GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA
damage-inducible 45). In addition, GADD45A is involved
in cell cycle regulation, survival and apoptosis [17]. The
p53-induced apoptosis is accomplished by expressing
the target genes PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of
apoptosis) and BAX. Through its BH3 domain, Puma binds
the anti-apoptotic proteins Bxl-XL and Bcl-2 prohibiting their
inhibitory function on Bax [18]. Active Bax permeabilizes
the mitochondrial membrane, releasing cytochrome c.
This leads to caspase activation resulting in apoptosis
[19]. Despite missing TP53 mutations in CM and MM,
the in vivo and in vitro response of classical p53-inducing
chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin is poor [20].

RESULTS
Epidemiology
A total of 139 patients with malignant melanoma
of the head and neck, treated in the Department of
Otorhinolaryngology, Technical University Munich, were
included in the current study. There were 112 patients with
CM and 27 patients with MM. Twenty-five patients with
MM demonstrated a sinonasal tumour manifestation, and
two patients had tumours in the oral cavity. Patients with
CM were significantly younger (mean age of 58 years,
SD: 15) than patients with MM (70 years, SD: 12, p <
0.001). Concordant with the UICC classification system,
the majority of MM was classified as T3 tumours. At the
time of diagnosis two patients (7%) with MM showed
locoregional lymph node involvement, as compared to
15 patients (13%) with CM (p < 0.396). Lymph node
involvement in MM exclusively occurred in oral MM.
In contrast, MM tended to exhibit less frequent distant
metastases at the time of diagnosis (p < 0.064) (Table 1).

Survival analysis
Recurrent disease was demonstrated in 10 (40%)
MM and 30 (19%) CM (p < 0.001). The mean diseasefree survival time in MM was significantly reduced (30
months) when compared with CM (107 months) (p <
0.001). After a mean follow-up of 89 months, the median
overall survival (OS) differed significantly between both
groups (MM: 40 months; CM: 99 months; p < 0.001)
(Figure 1).

p53 mutation status in MM cells and CM cell lines
Sequence analysis of the DNA-binding domain,
comprising exon 5–8, of TP53 revealed no aberration
in MM cells (TU-MM1-TU-MM4). The identification
of aberrations in CM cell lines (one missense mutation
SK-MEL 3: R267W and one frameshift deletion IGR-37:
C229DelTG) was previously described [21]. Whereas
IGR-37 expresses mutant transcript only, SK-MEL

MM, whereas 44% of CM showed Hipk2 positivity. Despite
the high number of p53-positive cases, the majority of MM
(58%) and CM (63%) showed a weak p21 staining. CM
demonstrated a significantly increased Gadd45a staining
in 100% of analysed samples. Ninety-two percent of MM
stained positive for Gadd45a ( p = 0.004). Of the CM cases,
94% stained positive for Puma and 62% were positive for
Bax; however, only 78% of the MM were positive for Puma
and 42% for Bax. The observed tendency failed to reach
statistical significance ( p = 0.08; p = 0.09). In contrast
to the high expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, the vast
majority of CM (92%) and MM (81%) were negative for
Casp9. Cell-cycle regulating protein Cdk1 was detected in
38% of CM and 63% of MM (Table 2).

Proteins involved in the p53 pathway
Immunohistochemical staining revealed p53
positivity in 94% of the CM and 80% of MM with a
significantly higher expression in CM. Mdm2 that is
directly involved in the p53 protein stabilisation was
positive in 71% of MM and 81% of CM without statistical
significance. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a
striking difference of Hipk2 staining patterns between
the groups ( p < 0.005). Hipk2, responsible for p53Ser46

cell lines when compared with primary melanocytes. A
significant and stepwise decrease can be observed in MM
cells, from melanoma cell lines harbouring wild-type p53 to
melanoma cell lines with mutated p53. GADD45A mRNA
was expressed equally in primary melanocytes and MM
cells; a significantly higher expression than that of CM cell
lines. BBC3 and BAX had significantly lower expression in
MM and CM cells. The lowest levels demonstrated p53knockout IGR-37. Analysis of CASP9 demonstrated a
significantly decreased mRNA expression when compared
with primary melanocytes. No differences were observed
for CDK1 expression levels in MM and CM, except IGR37 (Figure 3). To investigate the functional integrity of the
p53 downstream, cells were treated with 8 μM cisplatin.
There was no regulation of TP53 in the analysed cell lines.
All cell lines harbouring wild-type p53 demonstrated an
upregulation of MDM2, with the highest expression in
melanocytes and MM. HIPK2 was downregulated in
melanocytes and CM cell lines that expressed mutated p53.
Cell cycle regulation CDKN1A was upregulated in all cell
lines after treatment with cisplatin, while GADD45A was
upregulated only in melanocytes. BBC3 mRNA expression
increased in CM cell lines with wild-type p53 and in MM.
QPCR failed to demonstrate a regulation BAX or CASP9.
A CDK1 downregulation was exclusively seen in MM
(Figure 3).

QPCR of FFPE tumour samples did not show
significant differences in the expression of TP53, BBC3,
CASP9, BCL2A1, and CDK1. HIPK2, MDM2, CDKN1A,
and BAX mRNA expression was increased in MuM
demonstrating differences from 2.6- to 4.2-fold. GADD45
showed 2.4-fold decreased expression in MM (Figure 2).

Quantitative PCR of the p53 pathway in MM
cells and CM cell lines
QPCR of untreated MM cells and CM cell lines
revealed different expression patterns of analysed genes
due to the underlying p53 mutation status. Primary MM
cells and melanoma cell lines harbouring wild-type
p53 demonstrated a significantly lower TP53 mRNA
expression when compared with primary melanocytes.
The lowest TP53 mRNA levels were determined for p53knockout cell line IGR-37. Parallel with p53 mRNA levels,
significantly decreased mRNA levels were detected for p53
stabilizing HIPK2 in all p53 wild-type cell lines and IGR37. No differences were observed for melanoma cell lines
expressing mutated p53. Direct p53 target gene CDKN1A

is downregulated by cisplatin in MM cells, it is enhanced
in CM cells. All untreated cells demonstrated Casp9
expression. Cells did not regulate Casp9 after treatment with
cisplatin, nor did they show any cleave products (Figure 4).

To further analyse the p53 activation capability after
cisplatin treatment on protein level, the protein expression
was analysed in western blot experiments. Despite unaltered
TP53 mRNA levels, a stabilisation of p53 protein could be
observed in melanocytes and all MM cells. In SK-MEL
30, SK-MEL 3 and IGR-37 cisplatin incubation failed to
induce the p53 protein. Cell lines that showed p53 induction
demonstrated subsequent p21 upregulation. Independent of
p53 or p21 expression, all cell lines, except SK-MEL30,
showed an increased Mdm2 level, even though the protein
amount of MM cells was difficult to detect. Treatment with
cisplatin failed to induce a consistent response in the p53
downstream signalling. If detectable, Gadd45A and Puma
showed no significant regulations. Bax stabilisation was
seen in three out of four MM cells and weakly, but not
significant, in all CM cells excluding COLO-849. MM and
CM cells tended to regulate the cell-cycle regulating protein

DISCUSSION
MM represents a small subgroup of malignant
melanoma. The vast majority of MM originate in the
sinonasal region and are clinically aggressive. This study
includes 112 patients with CM and 27 with MM of the
head and neck region. The high percentage of MM can be
attributed to its sinonasal and oral origin and the
subsequent admission to our otorhinolaryngology
department. Similar to findings in the current literature,
our study showed that patients with MM were significantly
older than their cutaneous counterparts (MM 70 years, SD:
12, CM 58 years, SD: 15, p < 0.001) [4]. The prevalence

of women was not determined in this study. According to
the UICC staging system, most MM were classified as T3
tumours. At time of diagnosis no difference was seen in
the locoregional metastasis rate (MM 7%, CM 13%,
p < 0.396), but MM did demonstrated a tendency for less
frequent distant metastases at the time of diagnosis
(p < 0.064). A significant difference was seen in the
disease-free and overall survival in favour of CM
(p < 0.001). A multifocal tumor expansion and the difficult
anatomic site in the sinonasal system often prevent
resections with an appropriate R-status. Therefore,
recurrence rates are estimated to be about 50%–90% [22].
While systemic therapeutic approaches failed to improve
patients’ prognoses in MM, it remains unclear whether the
aggressive phenotype refers to a limited resectability in the
sinonasal region or to distinct biological mechanisms.
TP53 is frequently mutated in solid tumours, whereas
mutations in CM and MM are rare [12]. The mutation load
in MM is estimated to be five- to ten-fold smaller than in
CM [23]. Although protein stabilising mutations are rare,
an accumulation of wild-type p53 can be demonstrated in
the majority of CM and MM [24]. Recently, a disruption
of cell-cycle regulating proteins, Bcl-2, p53 and p16, were
associated with the carcinogenesis of primary oral mucosal
melanomas [25]. While wild-type p53 demonstrates a
short half-life of approximately 30 minutes, p53 is
physiologically stabilised after cellular stresses by a broad
variety of posttranslational modifications, including
acetylation, phosphorylation and sumoylation, increasing
its transcriptional activation, or enhancement of DNA and
promoter specific binding [26, 27]. An accumulation of the
p53 protein in untreated cells implies a disruption of its
functional integrity indicating a p53 mutation or an
interaction with viral oncogenes [28]. In the current
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cohort, all MM cells showed wild-type p53, while two
mutations were detected in five CM cell lines. In contrast,
western blot analysis demonstrated an accumulation of the
p53 protein in all cells, except p53-knockout IGR-37.
Immunohistochemical staining of 40 tumour samples
confirmed the high p53 expression level in CM and MM.
In our cohort, CM (92%) showed a significantly higher
p53 expression level than MM (72%; p < 0.04). In the
absence of protein stabilising mutations in seven of nine
tumour cell lines, other mechanisms have to be considered
to explain the abrogation of the p53 pathway, particularly
the induction of apoptosis, resulting in the accumulation of
wild-type p53. Blagosklonny constitutes a regulatory p53
feedback loop in which the loss of p53 function results in
a ‘compensatory’ p53 upregulation by decreasing its
degradation [28]. Therefore, the key point that leads to the
disruption of the p53 pathway has to be assessed in our
cohort. Recently, we demonstrated a functional p53
upstream in different melanoma cell lines [21]. In the
current cohort, western blot experiments revealed
cisplatin-induced p53 upregulation in all p53 wild-type
cells, except SK-MEL 30. The high p53 base level did not
result in further induction. Mdm2 and Hipk2 play a pivotal
role in the p53 stabilisation via phosphorylation at serine
residues. Overexpression of MDM2 by enhanced protein
translation was frequently observed in solid tumours and
was associated with tumour progression [29–31].
However, qPCR experiments demonstrated a significantly
higher expression of Mdm2 mRNA expression of primary
melanocytes when compared with CM and MM. QPCR
analysis of FFPE samples and cells revealed a significantly
higher MDM2 mRNA expression in MM when compared
with CM. Different qPCR levels did not result in a
different protein level in IHC or WB analysis, most likely
9892

due to posttranslational mechanisms or a TP53independent Mdm2 regulation. For example, a positive
feedback loop is described for p53-induced Caspase2mediated Mdm2 cleavage [32]. In addition, regardless of
the TP53 mutation status, Mdm2 mRNA expression was
upregulated after cisplatin treatment for CM and MM.
Importantly, the Mdm2 up-regulation of IGR-37 suggested
TP53 independent mechanisms. The hepatocyte growth
factor receptor and the insulin like growth factor 1 receptor
were found to regulate MDM2 translation by signalling
through PI3K and mTOR. Furthermore, several RNA
binding proteins were shown to interfere with TP53 and
MDM2 [29]. In contrast, CM with mutated p53 showed a
significantly higher HIPK2 mRNA expression compared
with wild-type cells. Pointing to an enhanced mutational
load in CM, IHC staining of 40 tumour samples validated
the higher expression in favour for CM [21, 23]. Cell lines
of a different mutational status failed to demonstrate a
significant HIPK2 mRNA regulation after cisplatin
treatment, which points to regulatory mechanisms on
protein levels. In agreement with the current literature, we
hypothesized a loss of p53 function in SK-MEL 30 which
resulted in an incapability to induce Mdm2, p21 and
Gadd45a [27]. This most likely indicates an interaction
with viral oncoproteins or cellular proteins that stabilise
non-functional wild-type p53 [28]. GADD45A, which is
involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation,
demonstrated inconclusive expression patterns. In FFPE
samples, qPCR and IHC detected a significantly higher
expression in CM, while cell experiments showed opposite
results. Untreated CM cell lines expressed Gadd45a in two
of five cases, including p53-knockout IGR-37, suggesting
TP53-independent mechanisms. FoxO3a, Egr-1, c-myc
and ZBRK have been identified as modulators of Gadd45a
expression [29]. CDK1 represents another cell cycle
regulation gene that is involved in the G2/M arrest.
Immunohistochemical staining, WB analysis and qPCR of
FFPE samples and cells revealed no differences in the
constitutional CDK1/Cdk1 expression. Interestingly, after
treatment with cisplatin, only MM cells decreased mRNA
and protein expression of CDK1/Cdk1, whereas CM cells
tended to stabilize Cdk1 protein and therefore promote the
maintenance of cell proliferation. Recently, the influence
of epigenetics in cutaneous melanoma gained in
importance. It was demonstrated that gene-specific
hypermethylation silences genes involved in cell cycle
regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis and cell signalling [33].
The potential impact of a distinct CDK1 mediated cell
cycle regulation in MM and CM remains elusive at this
point. Immunohistochemistry of FFPE samples and
tumour cells showed that the constitutional p53 expression
resulted in a significantly higher CDKN1A expression in
MM when compared with CM. Different CDKN1A mRNA
levels did not result in a different constitutional protein
expression as observed in IHC and WB. With respect to
Blagosklonny’s constitute of a compensatory upregulation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of wild-type p53 due to functional loss, elevated CDKN1A
mRNA levels are congruent with an accumulation of wildtype p53 but do not inevitably refer to a more
‘physiological’ behaviour, because a disruption of the
apoptotic cascade will result in an increased regulatory
feedback. TP53 downstream genes BBC3, BAX and
CASP9 showed no difference in the mRNA expression in
FFPE samples and untreated cells, except for a higher BAX
expression for MM in FFPE samples. These results were
verified on protein level. Immunohistochemical analysis of
staining patterns showed no significant differences
between the groups. Interestingly, despite a detectable
mRNA level in FFPE and cell lines, MM failed to detect
Puma in cell lines by WB experiments. Puma expression
correlates inversely with the melanoma malignancy grade,
and weak Puma expression is associated with poorer
overall survival, suggesting Puma as a marker for disease
aggressiveness [35, 36]. Recent studies demonstrated the
regulation of Puma by oncogenic miRNAs [34]. In human
oral squamous carcinoma cells, Puma was a direct target
of miR-222 and mediated the diminished apoptosis after
treatment with cisplatin [35]. Additionally, Puma
degradation in melanoma cells could be inhibited with
chloroquine, promoting apoptosis and demonstrating a
significant role of Puma in apoptosis of melanoma cells
[36]. In support of these results, we were not able to detect
an upregulation of CASP9 mRNA or protein after cisplatin
treatment. Recently, the impact of Puma was highlighted
in BRAF (V600E) melanoma cell lines. Unexpectedly,
treatment with MEK inhibitors led to an inhibition of
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in some cell lines via
activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway [37]. The PI3K-AKT
pathway was demonstrated to contribute to melanoma
resistance as well as its tumour initiation [38]. While
mutations in BRAF occur infrequently in MM, pAkt and
pErk expression were demonstrated in sinonasal MM [9,
39]. Interestingly, primary melanocytes do not regulate
pro-apoptotic proteins after cisplatin treatment. This
phenomenon is described for many normal cell types,
which are intrinsically apoptosis-resistant and results in
chemo-resistant tumours after malignant transformation
[40]. This may explain why melanoma is resistant to the
majority of chemotherapeutics [41]. Furthermore, Apaf-1
inactivation is described for melanoma cells, supporting
this hypothesis [42]. However, the disruption of Puma
mediated apoptosis in MM may contribute, despite the
challenging anatomic location, to the aggressive
phenotype. Therapeutic strategies inhibiting the PI3K-AktmTOR pathway or activating the apoptotic capability of
Puma are of major clinical import [39, 43].

CONCLUSIONs
Our study confirmed the highly aggressive
phenotype of MM. Comprehensive analysis of the p53
pathway in MM and CM revealed no differences in TP53

cells that represent the majority of MM and CM. The
regular induction of direct TP53 target genes failed to
induce apoptosis mediated by CASP9. A disruption of
BBC3 mediated apoptosis may result in the poor response
of MM after treatment with cisplatin, and developing
therapeutic approaches is of major clinical import. The
potential influence of a distinctive CDK1-dependent cell
cycle regulation has to be further investigated.

melanocytes (NHEM) were cultured in Melanocyte
Medium 2 (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were
treated with 8 μM cisplatin (Teva, Ulm, Germany) for
24 hours before protein or RNA was isolated.

MATERIALS and METHODS

RNA extraction from cells and FFPE

Patient selection

Cells were harvested from culture dishes and RNA
was prepared using the RNeasy-Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA from FFPE was isolated using the High Pure FFPE
RNA Micro Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The
RNA concentration and purity was determined with the
NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA).

The study included 139 patients with malignant
melanoma of the head and neck, including 112 patients
with CM and 27 patients with MM. Tumor samples were
obtained from the tissue collection of the Institute of
Pathology at the Technical University Munich. The tissue
collection was approved by the local ethical committee.
Tumor samples were histologically reviewed by at least
two experienced pathologists. Clinical parameters and
survival data were retrospectively collected including
age at diagnosis, sex, TNM-staging, recurrence, death
and loss to follow-up. Patients with lacking data,
incomplete staging, and refused or unfinished treatment
were excluded from survival analysis. The mean followup time was 89 months (range: 0–408 months). Paraffinembedded tumour (FFPE) samples from 16 CM and 24
MM were randomly selected and analysed with qPCR and
immunohistochemistry (IHC).

DNA extraction from cells and p53 sequencing
Cells were harvested from culture dishes and DNA
was isolated using the DNeasy-Kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer`s instructions. DNA concentration
and purity was determined with the NanoDrop system
(Thermo Fischer). For sequencing (Eurofins, Ebersberg,
Germany) TP53 exons 5–8 were amplified with KAPA
SYBR® FAST (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, United States)
using 60 ng DNA. The following TP53 primers were used:
exon5 for 5’- atctgttcacttgtgccctg, rev 5’- aaccagccctgt
cgtctctc, exon 6 for 5’- agggtccccaggcctctgat, rev 5’cacccttaacccctcctccc, exon7 for 5’- ccaaggcgcactg
gcctcatc, rev 5’- cagaggctggggcacagcagg, exon8 for
5’- ttccttactgcctcttgctt, rev 5’- tgtcctgcttgcttacctcg.

Statistical analysis
Differences between both groups were analysed using
the Chi square test and Fisher exact test for categorical and
the unpaired student’s t-test for continuous variables. As
main endpoints the overall survival (OS) and recurrencefree interval (RFI) were assessed measuring the time from
treatment to locoregional recurrence and death, and/or
distant metastasis. Survival rates by the log-rank test for
univariate analysis with p-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Quantitative real-time PCR
250 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using
the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, NY, USA)
or the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) for
cultured cells or FFPE sections, respectively. QPCR was
performed using KAPA SYBR® FAST (Kapa Biosystems)
and primers from the QuantiTect Primer Assay (Qiagen).
Results were evaluated using the 2-∆∆CT method. A fold
difference equal or larger than 2 was estimated to be
statistically significant.

Mammalian cell culture and treatment
Primary cells were obtained from mucosal melanoma
tumour tissue. The tumour tissue was cut into little pieces
and dried on culture dishes upside down for 30 minutes
before medium was added. After three to four days, the
tissue was removed and adhered mucosal melanoma cells
were cultured. The mucosal melanoma primary cells TUMM1–TU-MM4, as well as the melanoma cell lines SKMEL 30, IGR-37, MEL-JUSO, COLO-849 and SK-MEL
3 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were cultured under
standard conditions (37°C, 5% CO2, fully humidified
atmosphere) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium

Protein extraction and western blotting
experiments
Total protein extraction was performed using
cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The protein concentration in the supernatant was
determined with a Bradford assay. Western blotting was
performed using 15 μg protein per sample, which were
