Abstract
The transcription factor PPAR-g plays various roles in lipid metabolism, inﬂammation, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. PPAR-g agonists used to treat diabetes may have utility in cancer treatment.
Efatutazone is a novel later generation PPAR-g agonist that selectively activates PPAR-g target genes and
has antiproliferative effects in a range of malignancies. In this study, we investigated PPAR-g status in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and investigated the antiproliferative effects of efatutazone.
PPAR-g was expressed heterogeneously in ESCC, in which it exhibited an inverse relationship with Ki-67
expression. PPAR-g expression was associated independently with good prognosis in ESCC. Efatutazone, but
not the conventional PPAR-g agonist troglitazone, inhibited ESCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.
Mechanistic investigations suggested that efatutazone acted by upregulating p21Cip1 protein in the nucleus
through inactivation of the Akt pathway and dephosphorylation of p21Cip1 at Thr145 without affecting the
transcriptional activity of p21Cip1. We also found that treatment with efatutazone led to phosphorylation of
the EGF receptor and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Accordingly, the
combination of efatutazone with the antiepithelial growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab synergized to
negatively regulate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase–Akt and MAPK pathways. Together, our results suggest
that efatutazone, alone or in combination with cetuximab, may offer therapeutic effects in ESCC. Cancer Res;

Introduction
PPAR-g is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor
superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors (1).
PPAR-g plays a variety of roles in adipose cell differentiation,
modulation of metabolism, and the inﬂammatory response (2,
3). The protein interacts with and/or regulates multiple signaling pathways, including those associated with p21Cip1 (4, 5)
and p27 (6, 7) to regulate the cell cycle, with nuclear factor
kappa b (8) to reduce the expression of cytokines such as
interleukin-6, and interleukin-8, and with cyclooxygenase-2
and prostaglandin E2 to suppress inﬂammation (9, 10). Genetic
studies have indicated that PPAR-g functions as a tumor

suppressor in a variety of tissues, including the breast (11),
prostate (12), and colon (13).
Ligands for PPAR-g include endogenous ligands such as fatty
acids, D12,15 prostaglandin J2 (14), and exogenous ligands, such
as the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs including
troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone (15, 16). Numerous recent studies have demonstrated that PPAR-g ligands
exert antiproliferative effects. The ﬁrst-generation thiazolidinedione troglitazone showed antiproliferative effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (7), colorectal cancer (17, 18), and breast
cancer (19). However, these effects were limited, and small
clinical trials showed no beneﬁcial effects of these conventional
PPAR-g ligands (20, 21).
Efatutazone is a novel third-generation thiazolidinedione
PPAR-g agonist, which is at least 500-fold more potent than
troglitazone in terms of PPAR response–element activation
and inhibition of cancer cell growth, rather than inducing
apoptosis (4). Furthermore, efatutazone demonstrated antitumor effects in patients with advanced malignancies (22). This
agent therefore shows great potential for practical cancer
therapy.
Combination therapy using efatutazone with antitumor
agents represents an important means of achieving signiﬁcant
tumor regression (22). PPAR-g agonists have shown activity
both in vitro and in vivo in combination with conventional
anticancer drugs including platinum-based drugs (23), taxanes
(4), and irinotecan (24). However, the pathways affected by

treatment with efatutazone, and the most suitable combination therapy (in terms of molecular-targeted agents) based on
theoretical signaling mechanisms remain unclear.
Esophageal carcinoma affects more than 450,000 people
worldwide, and its incidence is increasing rapidly. SCC is the
predominant form of esophageal carcinoma worldwide (25).
Furthermore, esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive disease
with a propensity to spread both locoregionally and distally,
and multidisciplinary therapy has therefore been tested for
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC; refs. 26, 27). The
antiepithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody, cetuximab, was approved for head and neck SCC (28, 29), and new
molecular-targeted therapies have been expected for the treatment of ESCC (30).
The effects of PPAR-g are tissue and cancer speciﬁc. The
signiﬁcance of PPAR-g expression and antiproliferative effects
of PPAR-g agonists in ESCC have been reported in a few
studies, however these studies were limited because they only
evaluated the mRNA levels in small number of samples (31), in
adenocarcinomas (32), or using conventional PPAR-g agonists,
such as troglitazone (33). Therefore the expression of the
PPAR-g protein in ESCC and the antiproliferative effects of
the new generation PPAR-g agonist remained unclear. In this
study, we investigated the relationship between the expression
levels of PPAR-g and Ki-67 in patients with ESCC, and examined the antiproliferative effects and underlying mechanism of
efatutazone monotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. We also
investigated the effects of combination therapy using efatutazone with molecular-targeted agents, based on signaling analysis. The results of this study may provide a novel therapeutic
strategy for ESCC, and suggest that efatutazone, both alone and
in combination with an anti-EGFR antibody, may improve the
outcomes of patients with ESCC.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Efatutazone was kindly provided by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc..
Troglitazone, U0126, MK-2206 dihydrochloride, and cetuximab
were purchased from Cayman, Wako, Selleck Bio., and Kumamoto University Hospital, respectively. For the in vitro analyses,
efatutazone was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before
addition to cell cultures. Antibody information is provided in
the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Patients
This study involved 145 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection of ESCC at Kumamoto University
Hospital from January 2000 to December 2008 (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
Cell lines
ESCC cell lines (TE series) and HT-29 were obtained from
Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research Institute of
Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, the Riken
BioResource Center Cell Bank, and Keio University. The cell
lines have been tested and authenticated by Cell ID System in
October 2013. Cell lines (TE series and HT-29) were cultured in
5% CO2 at 37 C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS.

Xenograft model
Six-week-old nude mice (Balb-nu/nu slc) were inoculated
subcutaneously in the right ﬂank with 5  106 TE-4 cells in
200 mL PBS containing 50% Matrigel (BD, Becton, Dickinson
and Company). When the tumors reached approximately 80
mm3 in diameter, the mice were randomized into treatment
groups. This subcutaneous xenograft model was used to
assess the therapeutic effects of efatutazone (10 mg/kg) and
troglitazone (10 mg/kg) as single agents. Control animals
received 0.5 w/v% methylcellulose solution (vehicle). Efatutazone and troglitazone were suspended in 0.5 w/v% methylcellulose solution and administered to the animals daily by
oral gavage in a volume of 0.1 mL/10 g body weight, using an
animal-feeding needle. The anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab
(1 mg/injection) or placebo (PBS) was injected intraperitoneally twice a week to assess the effects of combination
therapy with efatutazone. Caliper measurements were made
twice a week using digital calipers, and the tumor volumes
were estimated using the following formula: V ¼ L  W  D
 p/6, where V is the tumor volume, L is the length, W is the
width, and D is the depth (30, 34).
Statistical analysis
Comparisons between treatment groups were made using 2tailed paired or unpaired Student t tests, as appropriate, based
on the results of F tests. The Mann–Whitney U test was used in
the event of a nonnormal distribution. The log-rank test was
used for survival analysis, and the Kaplan–Meier method was
used to assess survival time distribution. For analyses of
esophageal cancer-speciﬁc mortality, deaths as a result of
causes other than ESCC were censored. Univariate Cox regression analysis was also performed. The independent effect of
PPAR-g on mortality was assessed by performing multivariate
Cox regression analysis. Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as
a P value <0.05. All data were processed and analyzed using the
PASW Statistics 18 software program.
Study approval
All animal procedures and care were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Kumamoto University
(approval number H24347). Written informed consent was
obtained from the human subjects.

Results
PPAR-g expression in the normal epithelium and ESCC
We investigated PPAR-g expression in normal esophageal
epithelial samples and tumor lesions from 145 patients with
resectable ESCC using immunohistochemical analysis (Supplementary Table S1). PPAR-g was ubiquitously expressed in
the squamous layer of the normal esophageal epithelium in all
145 patients, and there was no variation (Fig. 1A). The positive
staining of PPAR-g was detected in 36 (24.8%) tumors in the
patients with ESCC. PPAR-g expression exhibited a signiﬁcant
inverse relationship with Ki-67 expression (P < 0.001, Mann–
Whitney U test; Fig. 1B–D).
A recent study reported on the relationship between PPAR-g
expression and prognosis in colorectal cancer (35), and PPAR-g
mRNA expression has demonstrated prognostic value in ESCC

(n ¼ 55; ref. 31). However, the relation between PPAR-g protein
expression and prognosis in ESCC remains unclear. According
to this study, PPAR-g expression was associated with a good
prognosis in terms of disease-free survival (log-rank P ¼
0.035; Fig. 1E) and esophageal cancer-speciﬁc survival (logrank P ¼ 0.033; Fig. 1F) in the 145 patients with ESCC according
to univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis (Supplementary Table S2).
We therefore hypothesized that PPAR-g was associated with
tumor-suppressive effects against ESCC, and that efatutazone,
a novel third-generation PPAR-g agonist, could be a potentially
useful anticancer agent in patients with ESCC.
PPAR-g expression in ESCC cell lines and
antiproliferative effects of efatutazone
PPAR-g expression was examined in 9 human ESCC cell lines
and in the colon cancer cell line HT-29, which was used as a
positive control for PPAR-g expression (36). Various levels of
PPAR-g expression were observed in the ESCC cell lines (Fig.
2A). However, efatutazone demonstrated antiproliferative
effects in all 9 ESCC cell lines (Fig. 2B). We investigated
antiproliferating effects and underlying mechanism of efatutazone using TE-4, TE-8, and TE-11, TE-6 cells, which express
high, medium and low levels of PPAR-g, respectively.

www.aacrjournals.org

We used 3 siRNAs for PPARG to conﬁrm that the antitumor
effects of efatutazone occurred in a PPAR-g–dependent manner. We selected TE-8 cells, because the PPAR-g expression of
TE-8 cells was strongly suppressed at both the mRNA and
protein levels using siRNAs for PPARG (Fig. 2C and D; Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). TE-8 ESCC cells were transfected with PPARG siRNA for 48 hours, followed by treatment
with control (DMSO) or 50 mmol/L efatutazone for 48 hours. In
the presence of the scrambled siRNA (negative control), efatutazone enhanced the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase isozyme-4 (PDK4), which is an established marker for
the activity of PPAR-g as a transcriptional factor (37, 38), by 2.5fold compared with the control level, but this effect was
blocked in the presence of PPARG siRNA (Fig. 2E). The
inhibition of proliferation by efatutazone was related to the
PDK4 mRNA level (Fig. 2F). Efatutazone inhibited the proliferation of the ESCC cell lines in a time-dependent manner (Fig.
2G), and PDK4 levels were also increased in a similarly timedependent manner and correlated with antiproliferative effect
of efatutazone (Fig. 2H). The mRNA level of PDK4 after
treatment with 25 mmol/L efatutazone was increased more
than after treatment with 25 mmol/L troglitazone (Supplementary Fig. S3A). No signiﬁcant antiproliferative effects of treatment with troglitazone were detected compared with the

control, however, the proliferation of both TE-4 and TE-8 cells
was inhibited by the treatment with efatutazone (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Because the antiproliferative effects of efatutazone were observed in various ESCC cell lines, we investigated
the mechanism underlying the antiproliferative effects of
efatutazone using TE-4 cells, which highly express PPAR-g.
In vitro antiproliferative effects of efatutazone in ESCC
cells and dependence on Akt-p21Cip1
Efatutazone was previously reported to inhibit cell cycle
progression via p21Cip1 in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (4,
5). In order to clarify the effects of efatutazone on the cell
cycle in ESCC, we subjected TE-4 and TE-11 cells to cell cycle
analysis by ﬂow cytometry. Accumulation of cells in the G1
phase, and reductions in the S and G2/M phases occurred
after treatment with efatutazone for 48 hours (Fig. 3A,
Supplementary Fig. S4A). In addition, PDK4 mRNA levels
were upregulated by treatment with efatutazone for 48
hours, whereas p21Cip1 mRNA levels remained unaffected
by the treatment (Fig. 3). However, p21Cip1 protein levels
were signiﬁcantly upregulated in Western blot analysis (Fig.

3C). We therefore focused on the posttranslational modiﬁcation of the p21 protein (39).
Activation of Akt, which associates with p21Cip1 and phosphorylates it at threonine 145 (Thr145), results in increased
cytoplasmic localization of p21Cip1 in breast cancer (40). We
therefore stimulated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–
Akt pathway with EGF (100 ng/mL) to investigate these
signaling changes in the ESCC cell lines. We found that Akt
was activated by treatment with EGF, and p21Cip1 was then
gradually phosphorylated at Thr145 in ESCC cells (Fig. 3D).
We treated TE-4 cells with efatutazone for 48 hours, followed
by stimulation with or without EGF for 10 minutes to determine if efatutazone was associated with inactivation of Akt.
Efatutazone reduced the phosphorylation of both Akt at Ser473
and p21 at Thr145 (Fig. 3E). Localization of p21Cip1 was
conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy. Some p21Cip1 protein was
detected in the cytoplasm in control cells, but strong staining
was detected in the nucleus following treatment with efatutazone for 48 hours (Fig. 3F).
The PPAR-g expression of TE-6 cells was lower (Fig. 2A) and
the antiproliferative effects of treatment with efatutazone were

lower than those observed in the other ESCC cell lines (Fig.
2B). We showed that the dephosphorylation of both Akt
Ser473 and p21 Thr145 in the TE-6 cells was lower than that
observed in TE4 cells (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Treatment with efatutazone could not dephosphorylate Akt
at Ser473 in TE-8 cells after treatment with siRNA for PPARG
(Supplementary Fig. 4C). These data indicated that inactivating the Akt pathway was one of the major targeted effects
of efatutazone.
Furthermore we used the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 to detect
the association between the antiproliferative effects of efatutazone and inactivation of Akt. The antiproliferative effects of
efatutazone compared with the control decreased with
increasing dose of MK-2206 (Fig. 3G). The antiproliferative
effects were correlated with p21 protein levels and were
inversely related to phosphorylation of p21 at Thr145 (Fig. 3H).
These data indicate that efatutazone regulates p21Cip1
protein levels in the nucleus by inactivating Akt and dephosphorylating p21 at Thr145, without affecting the transcription
of p21Cip1.

In vivo antiproliferative effects of efatutazone
To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have
demonstrated the antiproliferative effects of conventional
PPAR-g agonists, such as troglitazone, against ESCC cell lines
in vivo. We therefore compared 3 treatments in a mouse
xenograft model established using TE-4 ESCC cells. Animals
were divided into a control group, a troglitazone group and an
efatutazone group. Tumor volume did not differ signiﬁcantly
between the control group and the troglitazone group; however, a 49.6%  13.6% (average  SD) reduction in tumor
volume was observed in the efatutazone group compared with
the control group (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Fig. S5A). The mRNA
expression of PLIN2, one of the markers for the activity of
PPAR-g as a transcriptional factor, was doubled in the efatutazone group compared with the control group. The mRNA
expression levels of p21Cip1 and p27 were not increased by
efatutazone treatment (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S5B), but
p21Cip1 protein levels were signiﬁcantly upregulated (Fig. 4C).
We therefore investigated the phosphorylation status of
Akt at Ser473 and of p21 at Thr145. Inactivation of Akt and

dephosphorylation of p21 at Thr145 were detected more
frequently in the efatutazone group than the control group
(Fig. 4C). Immunohistochemical staining also demonstrated
dephosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and p21 at Thr145 in the
cytoplasm in the efatutazone group (Fig. 4D). We immunohistochemically examined the expression levels of both
p21Cip1 and Ki-67 in the nucleus and found that the rate of
positive staining for p21Cip1 was signiﬁcantly increased (Fig.
4D and E), whereas that for Ki-67 was signiﬁcantly decreased
(Fig. 4D and F) by efatutazone compared with both the control
and troglitazone groups.
Efatutazone activates EGFR/MAPK signaling
The antiproliferative effects of efatutazone were associated with dephosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. Because Akt is
downstream of EGFR signaling via the PI3K–Akt pathway,
we investigated the phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine
1068 (Tyr1068). We conﬁrmed that efatutazone inactivated
Akt pathway within 3 hours, whereas efatutazone gradually
phosphorylated EGFR at Tyr1068 for 24 hours in TE-4 cells in
vitro (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, using conditioned medium
(Supplementary Fig. S6), we found that phosphorylation
of EGFR was not caused by efatutazone directly, but was

580

Cancer Res; 74(2) January 15, 2014

induced by medium from efatutazone-treated in TE-4 cells
(Fig. 5B). These data indicated that secreted factors after
treatment with efatutazone stimulated phosphorylation of
EGFR at Tyr1068 in ESCC cells. We conﬁrmed that activated
EGFR was detected in 3 ESCC cell lines, TE-4, TE-8, and TE11 cells after treatment with efatutazone for 48 hours in vitro
(Fig. 5C). Tyr1068 of EGFR was signiﬁcantly phosphorylated
following treatment with efatutazone, and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was phosphorylated at
Thr202/Tyr204 in TE-4 xenograft tumor lysates, compared
with both control and troglitazone-treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). EGFR phosphorylation at
Tyr1068 and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204
were also detected in xenograft tumor lysates from all 3
cell lines (Fig. 5D). Immunohistochemical staining showed
activated EGFR at the membrane in TE-4 xenografts after
treatment with efatutazone (Fig. 5E).
In vitro effects of combination of efatutazone and MEK
inhibitor or anti-EGFR antibody
Importantly, the antiproliferative effects of efatutazone were
associated with inactivation of Akt, whereas EGFR/MAPK
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling was activated.

and the medium was collected. Conditioned medium (cond. med.) control and cond. med. efatutazone were adjusted to have the same density of both
efatutazone and DMSO. TE-4 cells were treated with these conditioned media (lanes 3, 4) for 10 minutes, and EGFR (p-EGFR) was then determined. C, Western

pretreated with or without cetuximab (300 mg/mL) for 6 hours, followed by stimulation with the conditioned media.

We therefore used molecular-targeted agents in combination
with efatutazone to suppress MAPK or EGFR signaling.
The MEK inhibitor U0126 (Supplementary Fig. S8A) was
used in combination with efatutazone. Dephosphorylation of
ERK 1/2 was detected after treatment with efatutazone combined with U0126. However, EGFR/Akt signaling was activated
by combined treatment, compared with treatment with efatutazone alone (Fig. 5F). The growth inhibitory effects of
U0126, efatutazone, and the combination of the 2 agents were
37.3  5.0, 31.1  3.6, and 51.6  3.9, respectively, compared
with the control (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Fig. S8B).
The anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Supplementary Fig.
S8C and S8D) was also investigated in combination with
efatutazone. Signiﬁcantly, phosphorylation of EGFR at
Tyr1068 caused by treatment with efatutazone was not
detected after treatment with the combination of efatutazone and cetuximab. Furthermore, both the PI3K–Akt and
MAPK pathways were inactivated by this combination ther-

apy (Fig. 5F). The growth inhibitory effects of cetuximab,
efatutazone, and efatutazone combined with cetuximab
were 19.7  6.1, 31.1  3.6, and 44.9  0.5, respectively,
compared with the control (Fig. 5H, Supplementary Fig.

medium for 10 minutes activated EGFR, however EGFR was
not phosphorylated at Tyr1068 when TE-4 cells were pretreated with cetuximab for 6 hours (Fig. 5I).
In vivo effects of combination therapy with efatutazone

Cetuximab exhibited better efﬁcacy than U0126 when used
in combination with efatutazone in vitro. We therefore investigated the antiproliferative effects of efatutazone combined
with cetuximab in a mouse TE-4 cell xenograft model. Mice
were divided into 4 treatment groups: control group, efatutazone group, cetuximab group, and combination group (Fig.

after 38 days (Fig. 6B).
EGFR was more dephosphorylated in the combinationtreatment group than in the control group, and inactivation
of both the PI3K–Akt and MAPK pathways was demonstrated (Fig. 6C). Activation of EGFR at the membrane in TE-4
xenografts after treatment with efatutazone was suppressed
in tumors of animals treated with efatutazone plus cetuximab, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining
(Fig. 6D).
The body weights of the mice were measured twice a week.
The mice treated with efatutazone alone tended to gain more
weight than control mice, but the body weights of mice treated
with efatutazone combined with cetuximab showed no significant difference from the controls (Fig. 6E).

Discussion
PPAR-g expression is tissue and cancer speciﬁc, and the
expression of PPAR-g protein in patients with ESCC and the
antiproliferative effects and mechanism of action of the new
generation PPAR-g agonists in ESCC remain unclear. We
therefore investigated the expression of PPAR-g in 145 patients
with ESCC, and clearly demonstrated the antiproliferative
effects and mechanism of action of the novel PPAR agonist,
efatutazone.

582

Cancer Res; 74(2) January 15, 2014

We demonstrated that PPAR-g was expressed in normal
esophageal squamous epithelium, and was expressed heterogeneously in ESCC tumors. It exhibited an inverse relationship
with Ki-67 expression, as determined by immunohistochemistry.
To the best of our knowledge, efatutazone is the ﬁrst PPAR-g
agonist shown to inhibit the proliferation of ESCC cell lines
both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the results of this study
suggest that the novel antiproliferative mechanism of efatutazone involves regulation of p21Cip1 protein levels in the
nucleus by inactivating Akt signaling and dephosphorylating
p21 at Thr145, without affecting the transcriptional activity of
p21Cip1.
The EGFR/MAPK pathway was activated by efatutazone,
and combined treatment with efatutazone and cetuximab
suppressed both the PI3K–Akt and MAPK pathways, leading
to synergistic antiproliferative effects (Fig. 7).
PPAR-g is affected by endogenous ligands such as D12,15
prostaglandin J2, and serves as a transcriptional factor in vivo
(14). However, the current investigation demonstrated that
PPAR-g expression seems to be heterogeneous during carcinogenesis. In addition, PPAR-g expression had an inverse
relationship with Ki-67 expression, and may be associated
with tumor-suppressive effects. We therefore investigated if
activation of PPAR-g by a high-afﬁnity PPAR-g ligand induced
antitumor effects in ESCC.
The conventional PPAR-g agonist troglitazone partially
inhibited ESCC proliferation in vitro in previous studies (41).
However, our results showed no signiﬁcant antiproliferative

Figure 7. Effects of treatment with efatutazone alone and in combination with cetuximab. A, no treatment. EGFR is phosphorylated by EGF stimulation,
and both the PI3K–Akt and MAPK pathways are activated. Activated Akt phosphorylates p21 Thr145 and leads to p21Cip1 translocation from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic localization of p21Cip1 is associated with survival pathways. B, efatutazone inactivates Akt, and p21 Thr145 is
dephosphorylated. This leads to an increase in the p21Cip1 protein level in the nucleus and G1 arrest. However, the EGFR/MAPK pathways are activated.

effect of troglitazone in ESCC cell lines, whereas efatutazone
caused a 49.6% reduction in proliferation of xenografted ESCC
cells, and the tumor-reduction rate was similar to the maximum effect of efatutazone against HT-29 colon cancer cells in a
previous xenograft study (24). This result suggests that efatutazone represents a promising antitumor agent for patients
with ESCC. However, the mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative effects of efatutazone are poorly understood.
This study demonstrated that efatutazone upregulated
p21Cip1 protein levels in the nucleus without affecting p21Cip1
mRNA. A previous study showed that Akt activation was
associated with phosphorylation of p21 at Thr145, which led
to p21Cip1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
(40). Cytoplasmic p21Cip1 has also been associated with
survival pathways (42) and a poor prognosis in breast cancer
(43). Interestingly, Akt activation by EGF stimulation also led to
phosphorylation of p21 at Thr145 in ESCC, whereas Akt
inactivation induced by efatutazone led to dephosphorylation
of p21 at Thr145, resulting in upregulation of p21Cip1 protein
levels in the nucleus in this study.
Signiﬁcant tumor regression may be typical for treatments
combining PPAR-g agonists with conventional cytotoxic anticancer agents (4, 23, 24). We found that additional antiproliferative effects were detected in ESCC cell lines when efatutazone was used in combination with 5-ﬂuorouracil, cisplatin
or docetaxel in vitro (data not shown); however, the antiproliferative effects and mechanism of action of efatutazone in
combination with molecular-targeted agents are unclear.
Importantly, EGFR/MAPK signaling was activated by efatutazone. EGFR was gradually activated after treatment with
efatutazone and the cause of the phosphorylation of EGFR
Tyr1068 was a secreted protein (factors) produced by the
efatutazone-treated cells. Activation of these pathways may
limit the antiproliferative effects of efatutazone, and the addition of molecular-targeted agents to efatutazone may help to

www.aacrjournals.org

suppress these growth pathways. We used U0126 in combination with efatutazone, but the additive effect was small. Recent
studies reported ERK-dependent negative feedback in several
cancers (44, 45). This ERK-dependent negative feedback was
lost after treatment with a MEK inhibitor, and the ability of
receptor tyrosine kinase ligands to activate growth signaling
was markedly enhanced (44, 46). Similar processes may have
been responsible for the effects observed when efatutazone
was combined with U0126. ERK-dependent negative feedback
was lost after treatment with U0126, and the secreted factors
produced by the efatutazone-treated cells stimulated EGFR,
followed by the remarkable activation of Akt pathway.
The activation of EGFR induced by the secreted factors
after treatment with efatutazone was not detected after
pretreating ESCC cells with cetuximab. We therefore used
cetuximab in combination with efatutazone, and demonstrated a notable synergistic effect based on signal analysis.
This combination therapy may have other beneﬁts. Although
the tolerability of efatutazone has been demonstrated in a
clinical study, more than half of the patients (51.6%) suffered
from peripheral edema, which is a recognized adverse effect
of efatutazone treatment (22). In our study, mice treated
with efatutazone alone also tended to gain more weight than
control mice, although this adverse weight gain was reduced
in mice treated with efatutazone combined with cetuximab.
A recent study showed that PPAR-g agonists rapidly stimulated sodium-coupled bicarbonate absorption from the
renal proximal tubule, followed by plasma volume expansion. The PPAR-g agonist–induced transport stimulation
was dependent on PPAR-g–Src–EGFR–ERK (47). In our
study, inactivation of MAPK pathway by efatutazone combined with cetuximab may have suppressed the sodiumcoupled bicarbonate absorption from the renal proximal
tubule and led to a reduction in the adverse weight gain
caused by treatment with efatutazone alone.

Sawayama et al.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated the tumor-suppressive effects and major underlying mechanism of efatutazone
involving inactivation of the Akt pathway. Treatment with
efatutazone combined with cetuximab produced a synergistic
effect by negatively regulating both the PI3K–Akt and MAPK
pathways. These results suggest that efatutazone could be used
both alone and in combination with cetuximab as a potential
therapeutic approach for ESCC.
