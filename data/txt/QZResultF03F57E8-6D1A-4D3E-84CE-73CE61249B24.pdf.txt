BACKGROUND. A multicenter phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate the safety
and feasibility of radiotherapy after paclitaxel, estramustine phosphate, and carboplatin (TEC) plus androgen deprivation therapy in previously untreated unfavorable-risk localized prostate cancer patients.

METHODS. Patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer were treated with 4
cycles (16 weeks) of continuous weekly paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 intravenously with
estramustine at 280 mg orally 3 times a day for 5 days a week and carboplatin
(area under the curve of 6) on Day 1 of every cycle followed by 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (total dose of 77.4 gray [Gy] in 1.8-Gy

therapies.1 Although the majority of tumors with
extracapsular disease remain responsive to androgen
withdrawal, this is only palliative and in most cases
evidence of progression is seen within an average of
12 to 18 months.2 Moreover, surgery and radiation
have proven inadequate as sole treatment options for
these patients.3-6 Patients with high-risk features
have a 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival rate
of approximately 35% after radiotherapy and about
45% after radical prostatectomy.7,8 Although attempts
to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of surgery alone
with neoadjuvant androgen ablation have yielded
lower positive surgical margin rates, they have not
demonstrated any long-term survival benefit.9,10
Given the lack of viable alternatives, these patients
are generally offered androgen ablation therapy with
or without external beam radiation therapy for local
control. Studies in unfavorable-risk patients have
demonstrated an improvement in local control and
biochemical relapse-free survival with the use of
neoadjuvant or adjuvant androgen ablation in combination with external-beam radiotherapy in contrast
to treatment with radiotherapy (RT) alone.11-13 However, there is substantial morbidity associated with
long-term androgen ablation.
Although long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has shown improved outcomes with
radiotherapy, the majority of those patients who
relapse post-ADT ultimately die because of their
castration-resistant disease, for which chemotherapy
may have an effect. The therapeutic challenge has
further prompted the use of combined modality
approaches incorporating chemotherapy and hormonal therapy with surgery and/or radiation aimed at
the intrinsically resistant cells and the micrometastatic disease that are both androgen sensitive and
resistant. In addition, it is hypothesized that more
aggressive treatment upfront with chemotherapy and
ADT would eliminate the need for long-term castration in these patients. Previous studies have investigated the use of estramustine and vinblastine in a
combined chemohormonal therapy followed by
radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.14 This was well tolerated, and long-term
progression-free survival (PFS) appeared to be
improved when compared with historical controls.
More recently, the taxane-based regimens were
shown to have an established clinical benefit in
patients with castration metastatic disease, and these
regimens may also act synergistically to further
enhance outcomes with localized radiotherapy and
ADT.
The combination of paclitaxel, estramustine, and
carboplatin (TEC) was developed to take advantage

of the unique properties of each of these agents,
including antigonadotropic effects, antitumor activity
in castration-resistant disease, and the ability of
these drugs to act as radiosensitizers.14,15 An unpublished pilot trial of neoadjuvant TEC followed by
high-dose radiotherapy performed at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center was shown to be tolerable
without significant adverse effects in a limited cohort
of patients (personal communications, Wm. Kelly).
Similar data in a multicenter study has not been
established. This study was conducted to see if it
was feasible and safe to administer this aggressive combined modality approach in a multicenter
setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Inclusion
Patients with newly diagnosed localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate with high-risk features were
eligible. High-risk features were defined as clinical
stage T1 to 2 with biopsy Gleason grade 7 to 10 and
serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 20 ng/mL, or
clinical stage T3b to 4 with any serum PSA or Gleason grade.16 Histological diagnosis and grade of prostate cancer was confirmed by central pathology
review in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) for each patient. All patients were 18 years
of age or older and had an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or
better. Adequate hematologic function (granulocyte
count 1500/lL; platelets 100,000/lL), hepatic
function (serum bilirubin 1.53 the upper limit of
normal; aspartate aminotransferase 1.53 the upper
limit of normal), and renal function (serum creatinine 1.53 the upper limit of normal) were required.
All patients underwent pretreatment evaluation with
bone scan, chest x-ray, and computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of
the abdomen and pelvis to rule out any evidence of
metastatic disease before enrollment.
Exclusion
Exclusion criteria included radiographic evidence of
metastatic disease on bone scan, chest x-ray, CT, or
MRI; prior radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
hormonal therapy beyond 4 weeks before treatment
on trial, or alternative therapy (eg, PC-SPES); the presence of any severe medical comorbidities including
cardiac disease (New York Heart Association class III
or IV), active angina, myocardial infarction, or cerebral vascular accident; and evidence of deep vein
thrombosis within the last 6 months.

Treatment
All CALGB institutions, comprised of 29 major university medical centers and their affiliates, were
approved to participate in this study, of which 10
CALGB sites enrolled patients as follows: site #1 (2
patients), site #2 (5 patients), site #3 (1 patient), site
#4 (3 patients), site #5 (1 patient), site #6 (2 patients),
site #7 (8 patients), site #8 (7 patients), site #9 (1
patient), and site #10 (4 patients), respectively. All
patients were started and maintained on a therapeutic dose of warfarin (Coumadin) before the initiation
of chemotherapy unless there was a contraindication;
this was discontinued before the start of radiotherapy. Patients were treated with 4 cycles (1 cycle 5 4
weeks) of chemotherapy consisting of continuous
weekly paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 intravenously with
estramustine at 280 mg by mouth 3 times a day for 5
of 7 days a week and carboplatin at an area under
the curve of 6 administered after paclitaxel infusion
on Day 1 of every cycle for 16 weeks followed by
radiation therapy to a total dose of 77.4 gray (Gy) in
1.8-Gy daily fractions. When the trial became activated, 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) planning was required and intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) was not permitted according to
National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines. Subsequently, IMRT guidelines were developed for use in
NCI-sponsored clinical studies, and the trial was
amended to allow either 3D-CRT or IMRT. The clinical target volume (CTV) included the prostate and
seminal vesicles, and the planning target volume
included the CTV plus a 1-cm margin except at the
prostate-rectal interface, where a margin of 0.6 cm
was used. Dose volume constraints were used for the
bladder and rectum. Radiotherapy data, including
diagnostic imaging, simulation films, portal films,
and dosimetric calculations, were reviewed by the
Quality Assurance Review Center (Providence, RI). All
patients received androgen ablation with either
goserelin acetate depot (3.6 mg) subcutaneously or
leuprolide acetate depot (7.5 mg) intramuscularly
every 4 weeks for 6 consecutive months (4 months
with chemotherapy and 2 months with radiotherapy).
All patients gave written institutional review boardapproved informed consent in accordance with institutional and existing federal guidelines.
Follow-up
Baseline laboratory tests including complete blood
counts (CBC), complete metabolic profile (CMP),
PSA, and serum testosterone were obtained before
registration. Thereafter, CBC, CMP, and PSA were
repeated every 4 weeks during Week 1 of each chemotherapy cycle. Serum testosterone was monitored in

addition to the American Urologic Association index
every 2 weeks during radiotherapy. After completion
of radiotherapy, patients were evaluated 6 weeks and
12 weeks after radiotherapy, then seen every 12
weeks thereafter for the first 24 months. Subsequent
follow-up was every 6 months until progression of
disease. Serum PSA and digital rectal examination
were performed at each visit.

Statistical Design and Data Analysis
Endpoints
The primary endpoints were acute and late toxicities
in patients with poor prognosis localized prostate
cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemohormonal
therapy followed by radiation therapy. Patients were
evaluated for acute toxicities defined as death or
grade 3 or greater cardiovascular (including venous
thrombosis), gastrointestinal, or genitourinary toxicity occurring during the period starting from treatment initiation until 90 days or less after the
completion of radiotherapy. Late toxicity was defined
as grade 3 or greater radiation-induced gastrointestinal, rectal, or genitourinary toxicity as defined by the
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Late
Radiation Morbidity Scale occurring >90 days after
the completion of radiotherapy.
Secondary endpoints were time to PSA failure,
PFS, and overall survival. According to the protocol,
the PSA progression was defined in 2 ways. The first
PSA progression was defined as 2 consecutive rises
in PSA with a rise of at least 0.2 ng/mL and above
1.0 ng/mL after radiation therapy; the date of PSA
failure is taken as the midpoint between the last PSA
before the rise and the first of the 2 PSAs that documented the rise. In addition, PSA progression (biochemical failure) was used according to the
American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology 1996 (ASTRO) criteria and defined as 3 consecutive rises in PSA after radiation therapy. The date
of PSA failure was taken as the midpoint between
the postirradiation nadir PSA and the first of the 3
consecutives rises. Furthermore, the revised ASTRO
criteria for PSA progression was used and was
defined as an increase of 2 ng/mL or more above the
PSA nadir, with the date of failure defined as the
date on which that PSA was measured.
PFS was defined as the interval between treatment initiation and the date of disease progression
(PSA, bone, tumor) or death, whichever occurred
first. Overall survival was defined as the interval
between treatment initiation and the date of death.
The target sample size was 50 patients allowing
for a 15% ineligibility rate. Sample size determination
was based on the late toxicity endpoint. A single-

3140

CANCER

stage design was used to test the null hypothesis that
the late unacceptable radiation toxicity probability at
2 years (P) is P  .05 versus the alternative hypothesis that toxicity probability at 2 years is P  .15.
Unacceptable toxicity was defined as grade 3 or
higher toxicity. If 4 or fewer patients experienced late
radiation toxicities at 2 years, the null hypothesis
would not be rejected, and the regimen would be
considered for a phase 3 study. If at least 5 patients
experienced late radiation toxicities at 2 years, the
null hypothesis would be rejected. This design had a
power of 89% and a type I error rate of 0.10.
With a sample size of 50 patients, the acute toxicity proportion could be estimated with a standard
error of no greater than 7.1%.
Acute and late toxicities at 2 years were estimated by proportions and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) based on the binomial distribution. In addition,
overall survival, PFS, and PSA PFS distributions were
estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method.
As part of the quality assurance program of the
CALGB, members of the Data Audit Committee visit
all participating institutions at least once every 3
years to review source documents. The auditors verify compliance with federal regulations and protocol
requirements, including those pertaining to eligibility, treatment, adverse events, tumor response, and
outcome in a sample of protocols at each institution.
Such on-site review of medical records was performed for a subgroup of 12 patients (35.3%) of the
34 patients under this study.
Patient registration and data collection were
managed by the CALGB Statistical Center. Data quality was ensured by careful review of data by CALGB
Statistical Center staff and by the study chairperson.
Statistical analyses were performed by CALGB statisticians.

respectively. Of the 27 patients, 9 patients (33.3%)
fulfilled all 3 criteria for the definition of high-risk

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Between May 15, 2001 and June 30, 2006, a total of
34 patients were enrolled in the study. The study was
closed early because of competing trials and slow
accrual. Of these 34 patients, 4 patients did not have
radiotherapy, 2 patients were ineligible, and 1 case
had limited follow-up data after radiotherapy. Final
analyses were performed on 27 patients. The laboratory and clinical characteristics of patients at baseline are presented in Table 1. The median age was 61
years (range, 52 to 75 years) with a median PSA of
29.1 (range, 2.7 to 356). The majority of patients had

grade 1 to 2 hematologic and nonhematologic (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary) toxicities included anemia (37%), leucopenia (18%),
neutropenia (23%), thrombocytopenia (15%), constipation (29%), diarrhea (33%), nausea (15%), transaminitis (15%), proctitis (19%), hematochezia (19%),
dysuria (33%), and urinary frequency (56%).

Late Toxicities Associated With Combined Therapy
The radiation-induced gastrointestinal, rectal, and
genitourinary toxicities as defined by the RTOG Late
Radiation Morbidity Scale were documented as
occurring 90 days after the completion of radiotherapy. There were no grade 3 or greater adverse
events observed during the late follow-up period.
The most common grade 1 to 2 toxicities reported
were proctitis (11%), dysuria (11%), and urinary fre-

quency/urgency (33%). Self-reported erectile impotence was reported in 37% of the patients; however,
no baseline or follow-up comprehensive erectile
function questionnaires were used in this study.

Clinical Outcomes
The median PSA nadir at the completion of chemotherapy and before radiotherapy was 0.30 ng/mL,
and the median time to PSA nadir was 2.94 months
(95% CI, 2.88-3.17). In contrast, the median PSA
nadir after radiotherapy was 0.10 ng/mL, and the
median time to PSA nadir was 9.95 months (95% CI,
7.44-14.8).
PFS
Figure 1 presents the Kaplan-Meier PFS plot. The
median PFS was 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.3-15.7).

One (3.7%) patient presented with local recurrence
and 3 (11.1%) patients relapsed with metastatic disease to the bone. All these patients had PSA progression before they had local or bone progression. The
median follow-up for 24 living patients was 38
months (95% CI, 29-42). Two of the 3 dead patients
died of prostate cancer. The third patient died of
metastatic pancreatic cancer.

PSA PFS
Of the 27 patients, 19 (70%) had biochemical failure
according to the old ASTRO criteria, with a median
PSA PFS of 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.3-15.7; Fig. 2A).
By using the CALGB definition, 18 patients experienced biochemical failures, and the median PSA PFS
was 17.1 (95% CI, 13.3-25.9; Fig. 2B). Sixteen patients
had PSA failures according to the new ASTRO definition with a median PSA PFS of 21.3 months (95% CI,
17.8-the upper bound not reached, Fig. 2C).

DISCUSSION
The optimal therapy for localized high-risk adenocarcinoma remains to be defined, given that local and
distant tumor relapse are both exceedingly common
after standard radiotherapy and androgen blockade.
Varied strategies have been undertaken in addressing
this population. Our trial emphasizes a proactive
treatment strategy incorporating measures aimed at
improving both local and distant tumor control. In
addition to using neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a
higher dose of radiotherapy was used in this study
compared with contemporaneous trials in locally
advanced disease. The dose of 7740 cGy is of interest
based on the randomized trial from M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center showing improved long-term PSA
control by increasing the radiotherapy dose from 70
Gy to 78 Gy.16 In that study, the benefit of dose escalation was limited to patients with a pretreatment
PSA of more than 10 ng/mL. Although the impact of
high-dose radiotherapy has not been definitively
established in the high-risk population, CALGB
99,811 established that combining chemohormonal
therapy with high-dose radiotherapy was both feasible and safe in this community, with minimal longterm genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicities.
Patient outcomes in this trial reflect the aggressive nature of the underlying disease. For example,
the median PSA was 29.1, and unlike other studies
there was no upper limit, which ranged to 356 ng/
mL. Most patients had T3 disease, and 78% of
patients had Gleason 8-10 disease. Although 1 study
hypothesis was that the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy might obviate the need for
extended androgen blockade, the results do not support this contention. For comparison, RTOG 92-02
demonstrated improved outcomes for high-risk

patients by increasing the duration of androgen
blockade from 4 months to 28 months.17 In the cohort
of patients with Gleason 8-10 disease, biochemical
disease control improved from 35% to 67% with the
administration of long-term androgen blockade.
Another area of current controversy is the importance
of irradiating regional pelvic lymph nodes in patients
with high-risk disease. RTOG 9413 suggested
improved PFS and biochemical control, but not overall survival, with the use of whole pelvic RT compared
with ‘‘prostate only’’ RT in localized prostate cancer
patients estimated to have a risk of lymph node metastases >15%.18 This benefit was only observed in
the subset of patients receiving neoadjuvant and concurrent hormonal therapy (as opposed to adjuvant
hormonal therapy), and the primary endpoints of the
trial were not met. Whether elective treatment of
draining lymph nodes is beneficial in the context of
systemic chemotherapy and high-dose RT is not
known, but pelvic RT may be a consideration in future
trials for this patient population.
The integration of chemotherapy with radiotherapy and androgen blockade for localized prostate
cancer has been evaluated in several pilot studies.
Previously, Khil et al reported the results of a pilot
study that combined estramustine phosphate and
weekly vinblastine concomitantly with radiotherapy
in 65 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.19 All patients received a total dose of 65 to 70 Gy
of radiation over 7 weeks, and no increase in adverse
effects over standard radiotherapy were observed.
After a median follow-up of 43 months, 63 of 65
patients (97%) were disease-free locally, and 44 of 65
(68%) were biochemically free of disease (PSA <4
ng/mL).19 A phase 2 trial reported by Zelefsky and
colleagues in 27 patients with similar high-risk features were treated with estramustine and vinblastine
concomitantly with high-dose radiotherapy (75.6
Gy).14 In this study, acute grade 2 gastrointestinal
(rectal) and genitourinary (urinary) symptoms were
observed in 35% and 48% of patients, respectively.
Acute grade 3 genitourinary toxicities developed in
11% of the patients. The 2-year actuarial likelihood
of late grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity was 20%. No
late grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicities were
observed. The 2-year actuarial likelihoods of late
grade 2 and 3 genitourinary toxicities were 25% and
12%, respectively. No grade 4 genitourinary toxicity
was observed. Although these investigators concluded that neoadjuvant and concomitant estramustine/vinblastine with 3D-CRT is feasible for patients
with high-risk prostate cancer, the incidence of late
gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities appeared
to be increased compared with 3D-CRT alone or in

combination with hormonal therapy. Ben-Josef
et al20 also investigated the tolerability and feasibility
of 2 21-day neoadjuvant cycles of oral estramustine
(10 mg/kg/d) and oral etoposide (50 mg/m2/d) followed by concurrent oral estramustine (10 mg/kg/d)
and 3D-CRT to 70.2 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fractions area in 18
patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Fourteen (78%) of 18 patients completed the entire
course of therapy. Two patients required discontinuation of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy because of
the development of grade 3 deep vein thrombosis
and grade 4 myocardial infarction. Acute major toxicities included alopecia (100%), anemia (69%), leukopenia (37%), and thrombocytopenia (19%).
In a subsequent effort to evaluate taxane-based
neoadjuvant regimens, Hussain and colleagues evaluated neoadjuvant docetaxel and estramustine in
patients with high-risk or locally advanced prostate
cancer.21 To minimize the hormonal effect, the duration of estramustine was limited to 3 days and
hormonal therapy was allowed after local therapy.
Twenty-one patients received a total of 98 cycles
(median, 5; range, 3-6) of chemotherapy with the
most frequent high-grade toxicities being grade 3 (8
patients) and 4 (1 patient) neutropenia and deep venous thrombosis (grade 3 in 2 patients) before institution of low-dose warfarin. Overall, therapy was well
tolerated. Additional therapy using surgery or radiotherapy was instituted as deemed clinically appropriate. Ten patients underwent radical prostatectomy,
with negative surgical margins in 7 patients, and 11
received radiotherapy with negative preradiotherapy
biopsies in 2.21 To decrease the morbidity of concomitant therapy and to further investigate taxanebased regimens in the neoadjuvant setting, an
unpublished pilot trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center evaluated TEC and ADT followed by
high-dose radiotherapy in localized high-risk prostate
cancer patients. Fifteen patients received the combined modality treatment without any observed
increase in early or late genitourinary or gastrointestinal complications; however, a quarter of these
patients developed a deep venous thrombosis (personal communication, Wm. Kelly). Because of the
high proportion of patients developing deep venous
thrombosis with TEC, we instituted prophylactic
anticoagulation with warfarin in the current study. As
a result, no venous thrombosis was observed in this
series of patients. Overall, the TEC regimen followed
by radiotherapy was well tolerated, with few doselimiting or severe toxicities. More importantly, there
has not been an increase in late gastrointestinal or
genitourinary toxicities, which are the major concerns for these combined modality approaches.

A subsequent phase 1 study reported by Kumar
et al investigated the use of concurrent docetaxel
and 3D-CRT for localized adenocarcinoma of the
prostate.22 Patients with unfavorable localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent daily 3D-CRT
to a total dose of 70.2 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fraction and concurrent docetaxel given once a week for 8 to 9 weeks.
With a determined maximum tolerated dose of 20
mg/m2 for weekly docetaxel, the overall incidence of
grade 2 diarrhea and grade 2 dysuria was 36% and
23%, respectively. One patient required intermittent
urinary catheterization 10 months post-therapy; however, this was resolved without need for any surgical
intervention. Seventeen patients have remained PSA
recurrence free, and all patients were alive at a median follow-up interval of 8 months (range, 2 months
to 27 months) at the time of publication. Importantly, direct comparisons between all of these studies is limited by the differences in protocol designs
(ie, phase I vs phase 2 trials), the various sequencing
strategies for combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy (ie, concurrent vs neoadjuvant/concurrent approach), and the different chemotherapeutic
agents. Nonetheless, relative assessments of the feasibility and tolerability of these different chemoradiotherapy regimens is useful.
A phase 3 study from the RTOG (RTOG 9902)
assessed the role of adjuvant oral estramustine, etoposide, and paclitaxel in high-risk localized prostate
cancer.23 The trial was stopped prematurely because
of the increased risk of thromboembolic events (despite the use of warfarin) related to the use of estramustine. A recent phase 3 study of more than 1000
patients showed improved survival for patients with
hormone-refractory prostate cancer receiving docetaxel and prednisone compared with mitoxantrone
and prednisone. These results call into question the
therapeutic index of estramustine-containing regimens. A recently activated trial conducted by the
RTOG (RTOG 0521) evaluates the role of adjuvant
docetaxel and prednisone (without estramustine) in
high-risk disease. Whether the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy earlier in the treatment course
(eg, neoadjuvant) offers superior benefit remains an
open question.
Overall, this study demonstrated the safety and
feasibility of using TEC neoadjuvant chemohormonal
therapy with high-dose radiotherapy in a multi-institutional setting in patients with high-risk localized
prostate cancer. Although biochemical relapse will
develop in a significant proportion of these patients
during follow-up, a median delay in disease recurrence of approximately 12 months can be reliably
achieved without long-term androgen ablation.

Whether this delay ultimately results in longer survival still remains to be determined. Further randomized clinical trials that use chemotherapy with
radiotherapy in patients with high-risk localized
prostate cancer need to be completed to see if this
aggressive approach will translate into an improved
clinical benefit for the patient.
