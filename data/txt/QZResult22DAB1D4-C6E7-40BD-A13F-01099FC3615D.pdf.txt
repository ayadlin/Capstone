Abstract
Gene expression and deacetylase activity of the class III
histone deacetylase SIRT1 are up-regulated in cancer cells due
to oncogene overexpression or loss of function of tumor
suppressor genes. SIRT1 induces histone deacetylation and
methylation, promoter CpG island methylation, transcriptional repression, and deacetylation of tumor suppressor proteins.
SIRT1 may play a critical role in tumor initiation, progression,
and drug resistance by blocking senescence and apoptosis,
and promoting cell growth and angiogenesis. SIRT1 inhibitors
have shown promising anticancer effects in animal models of
cancer. Further screening for more potent SIRT1 inhibitors
may lead to compounds suitable for clinical trials in patients.

Introduction
The class III histone deacetylases (HDAC), also known as the
sirtuins (SIRT1-7), are the silent information regulator 2 (Sir2)
family of proteins. Distinct from other HDACs, the sirtuins are not
modulated by the inhibitors of Class I, II, and IV HDACs, such as
SAHA. SIRT1, the founding member of the class III HDACs, shares a
catalytic domain of f275 amino acids with other sirtuins, and uses
NAD+ to mediate the deacetylation of histone and nonhistone
proteins. Although well-documented to extend the life span of yeast,
worms, flies, and mammals, SIRT1 has more recently been
implicated in the initiation and progression of various malignancies.

Modulation of SIRT1 Gene Expression and
Deacetylase Activity

The Biological Function of SIRT1 in Cancer

Modulation of SIRT1 mRNA expression by oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes. Overexpression of SIRT1 in cancer cells
occurs partly at the level of transcription. Two p53 binding sites in
the SIRT1 gene promoter normally repress SIRT1 gene transcription (Fig. 1A). The tumor suppressor hypermethylated in cancer 1
(HIC1) forms a transcription repression complex with SIRT1, and
this complex directly binds the SIRT1 promoter and represses its
transcription (1). Inactivation of HIC1 due to promoter hypermethylation in cancer cells results in up-regulated SIRT1 gene
expression. Importantly, HIC1/ mice are tumor prone and show
a SIRT1-dependent block in apoptosis induction (1). The oncogenic
RNA binding protein HuR associates with the 3¶ untranslated
region of SIRT1 mRNA, stabilizing the SIRT1 mRNA, and increasing

SIRT1 expression level (2). In contrast, the cell cycle checkpoint
kinase 2 (Chk2), a tumor suppressor, phosphorylates HuR and
reduces SIRT1 expression (2). Moreover, under cellular stress or
DNA damage, the cell cycle and apoptosis regulator E2F1 directly
induces SIRT1 transcription by binding to the SIRT1 promoter.
However, SIRT1 can bind and deacetylate E2F1, and inhibit E2F1induced transcription of target genes including SIRT1 itself (3).
Modulation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity by protein-protein
interaction and sumoylation. Through protein-protein interactions, the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 can be modulated by proteins
including active regulator of SIRT1 (AROS), the tumor suppressor
deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1), and the proapoptotic nuclear
desumoylase SENP1 (Fig. 1A). By direct binding to the NH2
terminus of SIRT1 protein, AROS enhances the deacetylase activity
of SIRT1, thereby increasing SIRT1-mediated p53 deacetylation,
both in vitro and in vivo, and inhibiting p53-mediated transcriptional activity (4). DBC1, which is homozygously deleted in some
breast cancer patients, acts as a native inhibitor of SIRT1 by direct
binding to the catalytic domain of SIRT1 protein (5). Depletion of
DBC1 stimulates SIRT1-mediated p53 deacetylation and inhibits
p53-mediated apoptosis; and these effects can be reversed in
cancer cells by concomitant knockdown of SIRT1, demonstrating
that DBC1 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis via SIRT1 inhibition
(5). Moreover, desumoylation by SENP1 reduces the deacetylase
activity of SIRT1. Under cellular stress, SENP1 directly binds to the
COOH terminus of SIRT1 protein, desumoylates and inactivates
SIRT1, resulting in p53 acetylation and activation of apoptosis (6).

SIRT1 regulates histone deacetylation and methylation.
Recruitment of SIRT1 to its target gene promoter results in
deacetylation of histone proteins at H1 lysine 26 (H1-K26Ac), H4
lysine 16 (H4-K16Ac), and H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9Ac; Fig. 1B; ref. 7).
SIRT1 has no effect on H3-K4 methylation, a mark associated with
open chromatin, but induces the production of H4 monomethyl
K20 (H4-mono-MeK20) and H3 tri-methyl K9 (H3-tri-MeK9), two
marks associated with repressed chromatin, and the production of
H3 dimethyl K79 (H3-di-MeK79), a ‘‘boundary’’ separating active
and inactive chromatin domains (7). SIRT1 not only directly
recruits and deacetylates suppressor of variegation 3 to 9
homologue 1 (SUV39H1), resulting in the trimethylation of H3K9
(8), but can also form a protein complex with SUV39H1 and
nucleomethylin. The protein complex binds histone H3 Lys9
(H3K9) in the rDNA locus, dimethylates (H3-di-MeK9) and
deacetylates H3K9 (H3K9Ac), and represses rRNA transcription,
thus establishing silent chromatin in the rDNA locus, and
protecting cells from energy deprivation and apoptosis (9).
Moreover, SIRT1 physically interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor to induce histone
hypoacetylation.

The Role of SIRT1 in Cancer

Figure 1. Modulation of SIRT1 gene expression and deacetylase activity (A ), and the diverse biological functions of SIRT1 in cancer (B ). A, SIRT1 gene expression is
modulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, and its deacetylase activity is modulated through protein-protein interaction and sumoylation at its
three protein domains. Pink ovals, tumor suppressor genes; bright green pentagons, oncogenes. Proteins that cannot be classified as typical tumor suppressors or
oncogenes are labeled with bright green squares for their stimulation of SIRT1 expression or activity, or with pink squares for their inhibition of SIRT1 expression.
Negative numbers, transcription factor-binding sites at SIRT1 promoter relative to the transcription start site (labeled with an arrow at the beginning of exon 1).
Red ?, inhibition; green arrows, enhancement. B, SIRT1 blocks cancer cell apoptosis and senescence and promotes cell proliferation by modulating histone
deacetylation, histone methylation, and promoter CpG island methylation, repressing tumor suppressor gene transcription and deacetylating nonhistone proteins.

SIRT1 induces heritable CpG island methylation at the gene
promoter. In cancer cells, SIRT1 localizes to promoter elements of
aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes in which 5 CpG islands
are densely hypermethylated, and inhibition of SIRT1 leads to the
re-expression of these genes (10). The tumor suppressor genes
repressed by SIRT1 include E-cadherin, which is often repressed
during epithelial tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis,
secreted frizzled-related proteins, mismatch repair gene MLH1,
the transcription factors GATA-4 and GATA-5, p27, and cellular
retinoid binding protein 1 (10). Importantly, in cells transfected
with exogenous E-cadherin promoter constructs, SIRT1 is recruited
to the promoter after the induction of DNA double-strand break,
and the recruitment of SIRT1 is required for the further
recruitment of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3h (DNMT3B)
and the subsequent heritable CpG island methylation of the
exogenous promoter (Fig. 1B; ref. 11).
SIRT1 deacetylates nonhistone proteins in cancer cells. The
nonhistone deacetylation targets of SIRT1 can be divided into three
groups: (a) transcription factors including p53, the proapoptotic
tumor suppressor FOXO proteins, E2F1, HIC1, BCL6, TAFI68,
retinoblastoma protein (Rb), PGC1a, peroxisome proliferator-

activated receptor g, p73, the androgen receptor, nuclear factor
nB, myocyte enhancing factor 2, MyoD, HDAC4, and others; (b) DNA
repair proteins (chromatin-related enzymes) including Ku-70 and
MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN); and (c) signaling factors such as
endothelial nitric oxide synthase and Smad7 (Fig. 1B). By directly
binding and deacetylating p53, FOXO1, FOXO3, E2F1, BCL6, and
TAFI68, SIRT1 suppresses the transcriptional activity of p53, FOXO1,
FOXO3, E2F1, and RNA polymerase I but, in contrast, enhances the
function of BCL6 (3, 12, 13), which is involved in the pathogenesis of
diffuse large-cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma.
SIRT1 blocks senescence, cell differentiation, and stressinduced apoptosis, and promotes cell growth, angiogenesis,
and vasodilation. It has been well-documented that SIRT1
overexpression can block stress-induced apoptosis by modulation
of histone deacetylation, histone methylation and promoter
methylation, repression of tumor repressor gene transcription,
and deacetylation of nonhistone proteins such as p53 (13), FOXO,
E2F1 (3), Rb, BCL6 (12), Ku-70, and Smad7 (Fig. 1B). Deacetylation
of Ku-70 blocks BAX conformational change and translocation into
the mitochondria, and consequent mitochondrial apoptosis.
However, it should be noted that SIRT1 is not always antiapoptotic

due to its ability to inhibit the trans-activation potential of nuclear
factor nB and to directly deacetylate h-catenin.
SIRT1 can promote cancer cell growth by blocking cellular
senescence and differentiation (Fig. 1B). The SIRT1 inhibitor,
sirtinol, can promote cell senescence in breast and lung cancer
cells. Overexpression of SIRT1 may block senescence by direct
deacetylation of p53, FOXO, E2F1, and/or RB, or by enhancing the
activation of S6K1 signaling, which decreases the expression of
p16. Moreover, SIRT1 represses the expression of differentiationassociated genes and retards cell differentiation, and SIRT1
expression in tumor cells correlates with a reduced histologic level
of tissue differentiation (14, 15).
SIRT1 is also a critical modulator of angiogenesis, vasodilation,
and blood supply. As a consequence of FOXO1 deacetylation, SIRT1
blocks endothelial cell senescence, promotes endothelial cell
growth, vascular sprouting, branching morphogenesis, and blood
vessel formation in mice. Moreover, by directly binding to and
deacetylating the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, SIRT1 stimulates its activity and increases the expression of endothelial nitric
oxide, leading to vasodilation, and increased blood supply.

Overexpression of SIRT1 during Experimental
Carcinogenesis and in Human Tumor Tissues
Overexpression of SIRT1 during experimental carcinogenesis. SIRT1 overexpression is an early event during the immortalization of normal human urothelial cells by hTERT, the catalytic
subunit of telomerase. In mouse epithelial JB6 cells, SIRT1 gene
expression is up-regulated by the carcinogenic aluminum oxide,
and the up-regulation of SIRT1 is essential for the activation of
activator protein-1, a well-established event associated with tumor
promotion. SIRT1 is, therefore, suggested to play an important role
in carcinogenesis induced by aluminum oxide nanoparticles (16).
Additionally, SIRT1 is recruited to the promoter region of DNA
double-strand break, and the recruitment of SIRT1 is required for
the subsequent heritable CpG island methylation of the promoter
(11), which is frequently associated with tumor initiation.
Overexpression of SIRT1 in human tumor tissues. SIRT1 is
consistently up-regulated in malignant cells or tissues from
patients with leukemia, glioblastoma, prostate, colorectal, or skin
cancer (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 14, 15). SIRT1 is the only
HDAC that is significantly overexpressed in leukemia lymphoblasts
as compared with normal lymphoblasts. In glioblastoma cells
purified from patients, SIRT1 expression is 4.9-fold higher in poorly
differentiated, stem cell marker CD133-positive tumor cells than
those more differentiated CD133-negative tumor cells (15). SIRT1 is
also significantly elevated in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, compared with normal counterparts, in three transgenic
mouse models of prostate cancer and in human prostate tumor
tissues (14). In colorectal cancer tissues, SIRT1 is consistently upregulated in cancer cells, compared with adjacent normal epithelial
cells, and up-regulation of SIRT1 has been suggested to be a useful
marker for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Moreover, overexpression of SIRT1 is frequently observed in tumor tissues from
skin cancer patients.
Overexpression of SIRT1 in chemo-resistant tumor cells and
tissues. Ectopic overexpression of SIRT1 induces P-glycoprotein
expression and renders cancer cells resistant to the chemotherapy
drug doxorubicin (17). SIRT1 is overexpressed in chemo-resistant
leukemia, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian, and breast
cancer cells, compared with their drug-sensitive counterparts.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (5). March 1, 2009

Biopsies from cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic
agents also express a higher level of SIRT1, compared with
untreated samples (17).

Small Molecule SIRT1 Inhibitors as Anticancer
Agents
A number of nonspecific and specific inhibitors of SIRT1 have
been discovered by testing natural products, by biochemical- or
cell-based screening of small molecule libraries using a forward
chemical genetics approach, or by chemical synthesis (reviewed in
ref. 18). These include the physiologic inhibitor nicotinamide, the
2-hydroxynaphthaldehyde derivative sirtinol, the coumarin derivative splitomicin, the splitomicin derivative HR73 and cambinol
(12), the tenovins (19), and the indole derivative EX527. The
structure and the biochemical character of some of the representative inhibitors are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.
Consistent with structural diversity, the inhibitors exert biological
functions through different mechanisms, such as SIRT1 protein
precipitation for sirtinol, competing with the histone peptide
substrate but not NAD+ for cambinol (12), and mimicking the effect
of nicotinamide for tenovins (19). Importantly, a number of
chemically synthesized epigenetic multiple ligands have been
found to simultaneously inhibit nonhistone and histone methyltransferases, SIRT1 and SIRT2, and induce dramatic differentiation
and apoptosis in cancer cells (20).
The only SIRT1 inhibitors that have been tested in animal
models of cancer are cambinol and the tenovins. Cambinol
selectively inhibits SIRT1 and SIRT2, causes BCL6 and p53
hyperacetylation and apoptosis in Burkitt lymphoma cells, and
enhances chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in various cancer cells.
In nude mice xenografted with Burkitt lymphoma cells, monotherapy with cambinol suppresses tumor growth (12). Tenovin 1
and tenovin 6 selectively inhibit SIRT1 and SIRT2, acetylate p53
and histone proteins, repress tumor cell growth, and induce
apoptosis in vitro. When injected into nude mice xenografted with
human melanoma cells as a monotherapy, tenovin 6 effectively
represses tumor growth (19).

Implications and Future Directions
SIRT1 expression and deacetylase activity are repressed in
normal nonmalignant cells by tumor suppressor proteins such as
p53, Chk2, HIC1, and DBC1. The overexpression of oncogenes or
the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes in precancer and
cancer cells leads to SIRT1 overexpression or enzymatic activation,
resulting in aberrant histone deacetylation and methylation,
promoter CpG island methylation, transcriptional repression,
deacetylation, and inactivation of nonhistone tumor suppressor
proteins such as p53, FOXO proteins, Rb, E2F1, and Ku-70. Because
these biological changes block senescence, cell differentiation, and
stress-induced apoptosis, and promote cell growth, angiogenesis,
blood supply, and resistance to chemotherapy, SIRT1 may play a
critical role in tumor initiation, progression, and drug resistance.
Further studies of the modulation of SIRT1 gene expression and
deacetylase activity by tumor suppressor proteins and oncoproteins will shed light on the role of SIRT1 in tumor initiation and
the role of SIRT1 inhibitors in cancer prevention. Further screening
for more potent SIRT1 inhibitors and in vivo testing of their
anticancer efficacy in animal models of cancer will eventually lead
to compounds suitable for clinical trials in patients with precancer
