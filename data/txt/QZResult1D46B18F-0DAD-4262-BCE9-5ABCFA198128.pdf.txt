Function-Blocking ERBB3 Antibody Inhibits the Adaptive
Response to RAF Inhibitor

Abstract
ERBB3/HER3 expression and signaling are upregulated in mutant BRAF melanoma as an adaptive, prosurvival
response to FDA-approved RAF inhibitors. Because compensatory ERBB3 signaling counteracts the effects of RAF
inhibitors, cotargeting ERBB3 may increase the efﬁcacy of RAF inhibitors in mutant BRAF models of melanoma.
Here, we corroborate this concept by showing that the ERBB3 function-blocking monoclonal antibody huHER3-8
can inhibit neuregulin-1 activation of ERBB3 and downstream signaling in RAF-inhibited melanoma cells.
Targeting mutant BRAF in combination with huHER3-8 decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death
in vitro, and decreased tumor burden in vivo, compared with targeting either mutant BRAF or ERBB3 alone.
Furthermore, the likelihood of a durable tumor response in vivo was increased when huHER3-8 was combined
with RAF inhibitor PLX4720. Together, these results offer a preclinical proof of concept for the application of
ERBB3-neutralizing antibodies to enhance the efﬁcacy of RAF inhibitors in melanoma to delay or prevent tumor
regrowth. As ERBB3 is often upregulated in response to other kinase-targeted therapeutics, these ﬁndings may
have implications for other cancers as well. Cancer Res; 74(15); 4122–32. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) is a
serine/threonine kinase that is mutated in approximately 50%
of melanomas. The prevailing BRAF mutation is a valine to
glutamic acid missense mutation at amino acid 600 (V600E)
that results in a constitutively active kinase (1). BRAFV600E
signals in a deregulated manner through the MEK–ERK1/2
pathway, which promotes cell-cycle progression, survival, and
invasion. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are small-molecule
inhibitors with selectivity toward mutant BRAF versus wildtype BRAF in melanoma cells (2, 3) and are FDA approved for
patients with metastatic BRAFV600E melanoma. In phase III
clinical trials, patients with BRAFV600E melanoma receiving
vemurafenib or dabrafenib had RECIST-criteria response rates
of 48% and 50%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) of
5.3 months and 5.1 months, respectively. These effects were a
signiﬁcant improvement compared with the 5% to 7% response
rate and 1.6 to 2.7 months PFS for patients on dacarbazine, the

previous standard of care. Unfortunately, approximately 15% of
patients fail to achieve any tumor shrinkage with vemurafenib
or dabrafenib treatment, and almost all responding patients
develop resistance within 1 year (3, 4). Mechanisms of acquired
resistance that develop following continued exposure of tumor
to vemurafenib frequently include expression of mutant RAS
and aberrant BRAF splice variants (5). In addition, the combination of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK
inhibitor trametinib has recently received accelerated FDA
approval for the treatment of patients with BRAFV600E melanoma. This was based on phase I/II clinical trial data showing a
RECIST-criteria response rate of 76% and a median survival of
9.4 months (6). Although the approval of the dabrafenib/
trametinib combination therapy marks an improvement in
the treatment of mutant BRAF melanomas, the issue of relapse
and the need to improve efﬁcacy remain.
One approach to improve the clinical beneﬁt of RAF inhibitors is to identify strategies that produce more effective
induction of tumor cell killing. In contrast to acquired resistance, much less is known about the adaptive mechanisms that
are rapidly switched on in the presence of RAF inhibitor and
promote cell survival. Initial preclinical models indicate a
resetting of the ERK1/2 pathway (7) and upregulation and
enhanced neuregulin-1 (NRG1) activation of ERBB3/HER3 in
BRAFV600 melanoma cells (8). Enhanced ERBB3 signals in
concert with ERBB2 leading to activation of the PI3K–AKT
(v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene) pathway, which has
been implicated in the survival of melanoma cells in response
to vemurafenib (9–11). Although there is much effort to
develop PI3K–AKT inhibitors to use in combination with RAF
inhibitors, their use clinically has been limited by toxicities
(12). Furthermore, experience from other tumor types indicates that the efﬁcacy of PI3K–AKT inhibitors will be

Blocking Adaptive Signaling in Mutant BRAF Melanomas

hampered by upregulation of ERBB3 signaling as a compensatory response (13). On the basis of these ﬁndings, we have
tested the signaling and antitumor effects of directly targeting
ERBB3 in combination with vemurafenib in BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells. These experiments showed that the antiERBB3 antibody, huHER3-8, inhibits the enhanced NRG1 signaling that is observed in RAF-inhibited melanoma cells, with
concomitant decreased proliferation and survival of cells in
vitro. The combination of RAF inhibition with huHER3-8 was
also more efﬁcacious than either treatment alone at inhibiting
tumor growth and promoting durable responses in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Inhibitors
Vemurafenib (PLX4032), PLX4720, and trametinib
(GSK1120212) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals LLC.
huHER3-8 is a humanized antagonistic ERRB3 antibody (14).
Cell culture
WM115, WM793, 1205Lu, and SK-MEL-28 cells were cultured in MCDB 153 with 2% FBS, 20% Leibovitz L-15 medium, 5
mg/mL insulin. A375 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10%
FBS. M238 cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and 2
mmol/L L-glutamine. All media contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37 C and 5% CO2 in a
humidiﬁed chamber.
Western blotting
Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane. Immunoreactivity was detected using horseradish protein conjugate secondary
antibodies (CalBioTech) and chemiluminescence substrate
(ThermoScientiﬁc) on the Versadoc Imaging System (BioRAD).
BRAF (sc-5284), ERK2 (sc-1647), and p-ERBB3 (Tyr1328, sc135654) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. ERBB3 (#4754), p-ERBB3 (Tyr1197, #4561), p-ERBB3
(Tyr1289, #4791), ERBB2 (#4290), p-ERBB2 (Tyr1196, #6942), pERBB2 (Tyr1221/1222, #2243), AKT (#9272), p-AKT (Ser473,
#6942), p-AKT (Thr308, #2965), p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204,
#9101), and GAPDH (#2118) antibodies were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology. Actin (A2066) antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
Reverse phase protein array analysis
A375 and 1205Lu cells were plated in 6-welled dishes at 2 
105 cells per well. Cells were treated with DMSO control or
1 mmol/L vemurafenib for 24 hours. huHER3-8 (10 mg/mL) was
then added for 45 minutes followed by 10 ng/mL NRG1 for an
additional 15 minutes or 24 hours. Cells were lysed in reverse
phase protein array (RPPA) lysis buffer, and proteins prepared
and analyzed by RPPA, as previously described (15). Lysates
were run against 172 validated antibodies, and analyses were
performed using normalized data.
Pathway analysis
Pathway analysis was performed using triplicate normalized
RPPA data that were transformed for use with the Gene Set

www.aacrjournals.org

Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software (16). To generate a single
value for each gene, RPPA values of phosphorylated proteins
were averaged and normalized to their unphosphorylated
counterpart when possible. These values were uploaded to
GSEA and analyzed comparing NRG1-treated versus NRG1 and
huHER3-8–treated samples in the presence of vemurafenib
using Gene Ontology gene sets available from MSigDB. Cytoscape interactomes were generated using signiﬁcantly (t test
metric ranking; normalized enrichment score  1.49; nominal
P value  0.01; gene sets  5 genes) enriched pathways (17).
Values used for GSEA analysis were then averaged and normalized to vemurafenib alone–treated samples to generate
color labeling of proteins associated with enriched pathways.
Annexin V staining
Cells were treated with 1 mmol/L vemurafenib for 24 hours.
Medium containing vemurafenib was then replenished and
cells treated with 10 mg/mL of huHER3-8 antibody for 45
minutes before stimulation with 10 ng/mL NRG1. After 72
hours, ﬂoating and adherent cells were washed and incubated
with 5 mL Annexin V-APC (BD Biosciences) in 100 mL 1
binding buffer (0.1 mol/L HEPES, 1.4 mol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L
CaCl2), and 0.2 mg/mL propidium iodide for 15 minutes at
room temperature. Cells were diluted in binding buffer and
analyzed on the FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer. Experiments
were performed in triplicate, and statistical analysis was done
using a two-tailed t test assuming unequal variance with error
bars representing SD.
EdU incorporation assays
A375 cells were treated with vemurafenib and huHER3-8,
and incubated with 10 mmol/L EdU (5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine). After 72 hours, cells were prepared according to the
Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Invitrogen) protocol, and analyzed using the FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer.
Experiments were performed in triplicate, and statistical analysis was done as in Annexin V protocol.
Crystal violet
A375 (3  103) cells were plated into 33-mm diameter
dishes and treated with vemurafenib for 24 hours before the
addition of huHER3-8 and NRG1. After 14 days, cells were
washed, ﬁxed, and stained with crystal violet. Pictures were
taken at 40 magniﬁcation on the Nikon ECLIPSE Ti (Nikon
Instruments Inc.). ImageJ was used to quantify percent plate
coverage.
In vivo assays
Female athymic mice (NU/J: Jackson) were injected intradermally with human melanoma cells (1.0  106), and cells
allowed up to 2 weeks to reach appropriate tumor volume.
huHER3-8 (100 mL of 1 mg/mL) was injected intraperitoneally every 3 days of the experiment. For shRNA experiments,
mice were given doxycycline (2 mg/mL) in the drinking
water 3 days before huHER3-8 treatment that was replenished every 3 days for the duration of the experiment. For
PLX4720 chow experiments, PLX4720 was formulated into
rodent chow at 90 mg/kg (Research Diets Inc.). Tumors were

using the formula V ¼ (L  W2)  0.52. Some animals were
euthanized due to the development of skin necrosis that
prevented them from reaching the maximum allowed tumor
volume (1,000 mm3). At the conclusion of each experiment,
tumors that were larger than 1.00 (progression), less than
1.00 (regression), or equal to 0.00 (complete regression) were
recorded. Animal experiments were performed at Thomas
Jefferson University (Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited) and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical analysis was performed using a mixed
effect model where error bars represent SE.

Results
NRG1–ERBB3 signaling in vemurafenib-treated mutant
BRAF melanoma cells is inhibited by huHER3-8
We tested the ability of the humanized anti-ERBB3
monoclonal antibody, huHER3-8, to inhibit ERBB3 phosphorylation in BRAFV600E/D melanoma cells. huHER3-8
binds within residues 20 and 342 of ERBB3 with an afﬁnity
of 0.17 nmol/L toward human ERBB3 in FACS assay using
SKBR3 human breast adenocarcinoma cells (14) and outcompetes NRG1 binding and prevents ERBB3 dimerization
with ERBB2. A 10 mg/mL dose of huHER3-8 was used for
experiments based on dose-dependent inhibition of NRG1mediated ERBB3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). In the mutant
BRAF cell lines, 1205Lu, M238, and A375, basal levels of
phosphorylated ERBB3 were low (Fig. 1A and B). Consistent

with our previous ﬁndings, NRG1 stimulates phosphorylation of ERBB3, an effect that was dramatically enhanced by
overnight pretreatment with vemurafenib (8). Pretreatment
with huHER3-8 efﬁciently inhibited NRG1-induced phosphorylation of ERBB3 in both untreated and vemurafenibtreated cells (Fig. 1B).
To better understand the effects of ERBB3 on mutant
BRAF melanoma cells, we performed an RPPA analysis on
1205Lu and A375 cells treated with vemurafenib and NRG1
in the absence/presence of huHER3-8 (15). PI3K/AKT pathway signaling was most affected by NRG1 treatment in both
cell lines (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Importantly,
pretreatment with huHER3-8 prevented the phosphorylation
of AKT induced by NRG1 (Fig. 2A and B). Analysis of the
RPPA data using Gene Ontology gene sets was performed to
determine the pathways affected by NRG1 and huHER3-8
treatment. In 1205Lu cells treated with vemurafenib and
NRG1, there was a signiﬁcant enrichment of cellular pathways involving phosphorylation and receptor signaling (Fig.
2C). By contrast, huHER3-8 pretreatment effectively inhibited the activation of NRG1-dependent signaling and significantly enriched pathways involved in the regulation of cell
death and apoptosis (Fig. 2D). A375 cells treated with
vemurafenib and NRG1 exhibited a signiﬁcant enrichment
of pathways involved in PI3K/AKT signaling, as well as other
cellular pathways (Supplementary Fig. S1). Pretreatment
with huHER3-8 in these cells prevented the enrichment of
these pathways, but did not result in a signiﬁcant enrichment of cell death and apoptosis pathways (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2 for full data set). Taken together, these data

suggest that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is activated by
NRG1 and inhibited by anti-ERBB3 antibodies in RAF-inhibited mutant BRAF melanoma cells.
huHER3-8 prevents NRG1/ERBB3-dependent long-term
activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in mutant BRAFV600
cell lines
Western blotting conﬁrmed RPPA data that NRG1 stimulated ERBB2 and AKT phosphorylation in RAF-inhibited
1205Lu, M238, and A375 cells and that these effects were
ablated by huHER3-8 treatment (Fig. 3A). huHER3-8 also
inhibited NRG1-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in
vemurafenib-treated cells. These results were dose-dependent
and observed in several other mutant BRAF melanoma cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). As the above experiments
used a short-term (15 minutes) stimulation with NRG1, we
performed a time course to support the RPPA data
that huHER3-8 elicits persistent effects. In six different
BRAFV600E/D melanoma cell lines, huHER3-8 inhibited phosphorylation of ERBB3 and AKT over a 24-hour time course (Fig.
3B). Notably, huHER3-8 caused a downregulation of ERBB3 in
all cell lines (Figs. 1A and B, 3B, and Supplementary Fig. S2A
and S2C). A small degree of reactivation of signaling was noted
in some cell lines (e.g., WM793 cells) after 24 hours (Fig. 3B). We
also observed an increase in ERK1/2 activation following NRG1
treatment of vemurafenib-treated cells (Fig. 3A and B). This
effect was independent of PTEN status, because overexpression of PTEN in PTEN-deﬁcient 1205Lu cells had no effect on
NRG1 stimulation of phospho-ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig.
S3). These results conﬁrm the RPPA data that huHER3-8
inhibits NRG1-stimulated phosphorylation of ERBB3 and AKT
in RAF inhibitor–treated mutant BRAFV600E/D melanoma cells.
huHER3-8 cooperates with vemurafenib to increase
cytotoxicity and decrease proliferation in BRAFV600
melanoma cell lines in vitro
Next, we investigated the effects of huHER3-8 in combination with vemurafenib on cell death and proliferation. As
measured by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, vemurafenib induced cell death in ﬁve of the six tested BRAF-mutant
human cell lines (Fig. 4A). In 1205Lu and other mutant BRAF
melanoma cells, NRG1 treatment reduced the levels of vemurafenib-induced cell death. Consistent with the pathway analysis, huHER3-8 signiﬁcantly enhanced cell death in vemurafenib-treated, NRG1-stimulated cells to levels similar to those
observed in cells treated with vemurafenib alone. Furthermore,
huHER3-8 treatment had no effect on cell death in DMSOtreated (Fig. 4B) or unstimulated cells, suggesting that the low
basal activation of ERBB3 does not play a role in cell survival.
Because A375 cells displayed intrinsic resistance to cell death
in this assay, consistent with previous data (10), we analyzed
effects on S phase entry in this cell line. NRG1 increased EdU
incorporation in vemurafenib-treated A375 cells by 5-fold (Fig.
4C). Notably, huHER3-8 signiﬁcantly reduced NRG1-induced
increase in EdU incorporation. The effects of huHER3-8 were
long lasting as huHER3-8 reversed NRG1-mediated stimulation
of A375 growth in 2-week colony growth assays (Fig. 4D). These

results suggest that targeting ERBB3 can reverse the protective
effects of NRG1 in BRAF-inhibited melanoma cells in vitro.
huHER3-8 combines with BRAF targeting to delay tumor
regrowth in vivo
Next, we generated 1205Lu and A375 tetracycline responsive
cells expressing an inducible shRNA targeted against BRAF.
Upon treatment with doxycycline, the reduced BRAF expression led to inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2 and upregulation of
ERBB3 and NRG1-dependent phosphorylated ERBB3, similar
to vemurafenib treatment (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig.
S4A). We used these cells to form xenografts in immune
compromised mice and tested the effects of huHER3-8 in
combination with targeting BRAF in vivo. In the absence of
BRAF depletion in vivo, huHER3-8 had no signiﬁcant effect on
tumor growth in 1205Lu xenografts (Fig. 5B). However, the
combination of BRAF targeting by shRNA and huHER3-8
treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of xenograft
growth (Fig. 5B). We also noted that 2 of 9 mice harboring
1205Lu xenografts in the BRAF shRNA plus huHER3-8 treatment combination had complete regressions compared with 0
of 8 mice in the BRAF-depleted alone 1205Lu xenografts (Fig.
5C). These effects were durable as indicated by their lack of
regrowth following doxycycline and huHER3-8 removal.
By contrast, effects of BRAF depletion alone and BRAF
depletion plus huHER3-8 treatment were comparable on the
growth of A375 xenografts, probably due to the strong initial
effect of BRAF knockdown in these cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4B and S4C). Thus, we examined the effect of huHER3-8 in
combination with pharmacologic inhibition of BRAFV600E
using 90 mg/kg PLX4720 chow, which produces plasma concentrations close to those detected in patients treated with
vemurafenib (G. Bollag, personal communication). Notably, 4
of 8 mice treated with PLX4720 in combination with huHER3-8
achieved complete (no detectable tumor) or near-complete
(94% reduction in tumor size) regression compared with only 1
of 8 mice treated with PLX4720 alone (Fig. 6C and D). To
determine whether the regressions were durable, these mice
were removed from treatment on day 27 and monitored for an
additional 30 days. No tumor regrowth was observed 30 days
after treatment in all mice that underwent complete regression; however, one xenograft in the combination group that
underwent 94% regression did regrow once removed from
treatment (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that the combination
of huHER3-8 treatment with BRAF inhibition in vivo may
increase the likelihood of a durable response. Together, these
results indicate that targeting ERBB3 may enhance the effects
of RAF inhibition in mutant BRAFV600E xenografts in vivo.

Discussion
There is strong interest in targeting ERBB3 in distinct tumor
types (18). Although ERBB3 is known to play an important
function in the melanocytic lineage during development (19),
its role in melanomas is poorly characterized. Here, we provide
evidence that supports the use of neutralizing ERBB3 antibodies in mutant BRAF melanoma as a part of combinatorial
approach to counteract adaptive resistance to RAF inhibitors.

response to lapatinib and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors
(13, 20), arguing for direct targeting of ERBB3. Initially, we

show that the neutralizing ERBB3 antibody, huHER3-8 (14)
inhibits NRG1-dependent ERBB3 activation in BRAFV600E/D
melanoma cells in vitro. RPPA and Western blot analyses
showed that AKT signaling is potently activated by NRG1 and
is inhibited by ERBB3 targeting. These data are consistent with

antitumor effects of vemurafenib (Fig. 7). An acute increase in
ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed following 15 minutes of
NRG1 treatment in RAF-inhibited BRAFV600E/D cells; however,
this phosphorylation subsided within 3 hours. Because sustained ERK1/2 activation has been linked to proliferation (22,
23), the acute effects observed here are unlikely to contribute to
the beneﬁcial growth provided by NRG1. ERK1/2 activation at
24 hours observed in some cell lines seemed to be NRG1independent and is more likely due to loss of negative feedback
inhibition on the ERK1/2 pathway (24). NRG1 provides strong

Blocking Adaptive Signaling in Mutant BRAF Melanomas

Figure 5. 1205LuTR BRAF shRNA-expressing cells mimic the effects of vemurafenib and combine with huHER3-8 to reduce tumor growth in vivo. A, 1205LuTR
cells expressing an inducible BRAF shRNA were grown in the absence/presence of 100 ng/mL doxycycline for 96 hours. 1205Lu parental cells were
grown in the presence of 1 mmol/L vemurafenib for 24 hours. Cells were then treated/untreated with 10 mg/mL huHER3-8 for 45 minutes followed by stimulation
with 10 ng/mL NRG1 for 15 minutes. Cells were then lysed and analyzed via Western blot. B, parental 1205Lu or 1205LuTR cells harboring an
inducible BRAF shRNA were injected intradermally into the backs of immune-deﬁcient mice. Tumors were allowed to form for approximately 2 weeks.
Doxycycline was added, where appropriate, to the drinking water 3 days before the start of the experiment. As indicated, mice were treated with huHER3-8
(parental, n ¼ 6; BRAFsh, n ¼ 9) or vehicle (parental and BRAFsh both n ¼ 8) via i.p. injection every 3 days. The graph indicates the mean tumor

Figure 6. PLX4720 and huHER3-8 combine to promote durable responses in A375 xenografts. A, A375 parental cells were injected intradermally into
the backs of immune-deﬁcient mice and allowed time to form tumors. PLX4720 mouse chow (90 mg/kg) was added at the start of the experiment and
replenished when needed for 27 days. Mice were treated with huHER3-8 (n ¼ 8) or vehicle (n ¼ 8) every 3 days. Tumor volumes on day 27 were categorized as
progression, regression, or complete regression as compared with day 0. B, fold change of tumor volumes compared with day 0 of individual xenografts

this upregulation was partially reduced by huHER3-8 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). A375 cells had intrinsically high levels of
MCL-1, which was unaffected by treatment with huHER3-8
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). Despite evidence of NRG1–ERBB3
regulation of p38/MAP kinase and JNK signaling in other
cancers (25, 26), we did not observe regulation of these pathways in BRAFV600E melanoma cells by RPPA analysis.
Enhanced effects of the anti-ERBB3 antibody/RAF inhibitor combinations versus either alone were also observed in
vivo. huHER3-8 combined with BRAF knockdown was more
effective than BRAF knockdown alone at inhibiting the
growth of mutant BRAF 1205LuTR cell xenografts. In
A375 cells, huHER3-8 gave no additive effect to BRAF
targeting when analyzing inhibition of xenograft growth,
but did increase the number of xenografts that underwent
complete and long-lasting regression. These data indicate
that ERBB3-neutralizing agents may have varied effects in
mutant BRAF melanomas. This is perhaps unsurprising
given the knowledge that the phosphorylation of multiple
receptor tyrosine kinases can be upregulated in response
to RAF inhibitors (13, 20). These data emphasize the need to
identify biomarkers that will predict the response to
huHER3-8 and other ERBB3 targeting agents.
Although other ERBB3-neutralizing antibodies such as MM121 (Merrimack) and LJM716 (Novartis) are currently being
tested in early-stage clinical trials (18), dual speciﬁc ERBBtargeting antibodies are also being developed. For example,

4130

Cancer Res; 74(15) August 1, 2014

MM-111 is a bispeciﬁc antibody with afﬁnity for both ERBB3
and ERBB2 (27), and MEHD7945A is a dual ERBB3/EGFR
targeting human IgG that is more efﬁcacious than monospeciﬁc ERBB3 and EGFR antibodies in xenograft models (28).
Recently, EGFR has been implicated in intrinsic resistance to
BRAF inhibitor (29, 30). We did observe a transient increase in
EGFR phosphorylation of the tyrosine 1068 but not tyrosine
1173 residue by RPPA analysis in RAF-inhibited A375 cells but
not RAF-inhibited 1205Lu cells following NRG1 treatment.
Future avenues will determine whether upregulated EGFR
serves as a biomarker for the weaker effects of anti-ERBB3
antibodies in some cell lines, in which case dual targeting
antibodies may prove more useful to counteract adaptive
responses to RAF inhibitors. It is also likely that combinations
of antibodies that solely target ERBB3 may elicit enhanced
effects in RAF-inhibited melanomas. This notion is based on a
recent breast cancer study where the combination of two
ERBB2-targeting antibodies, trastuzumab and pertuzumab,
with docetaxel improves median PFS versus trastuzumab plus
docetaxel (31).
Recent therapies designed to stimulate the immune
response to melanoma have resulted in durable responses in
patients. In addition to the antitumor effects of ERBB3 inhibition, the Fc regions on monospeciﬁc and dual targeting
antibodies interact with speciﬁc receptors on natural killer
cells and activate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC; ref. 32). For example, ADCC contributes to the

because ERBB3 upregulation in response to RAF inhibition has
been identiﬁed in thyroid carcinoma (34).
In summary, the data presented here show for the ﬁrst time
in melanoma that a clinically designed anti-ERBB3 antibody
combines with vemurafenib to increase cell death and decrease
cell proliferation in vitro, while reducing tumor growth and
increasing long-term response to RAF inhibition in vivo. Our
work highlights the potential beneﬁts of using ERBB3-targeting
antibodies in combination with ERK1/2 pathway inhibition for
the treatment of patients with mutant BRAFV600E melanoma.

Figure 7. Model for targeting ERBB3 adaptive response in mutant BRAF
melanoma. Vemurafenib treatment relieves a negative feedback on
ERBB3 transcription, resulting in an increase of ERBB3 at the membrane.
In the presence of its ligand (NRG1), ERBB3 heterodimerizes with ERBB2
to become active. Active ERBB3 recruits PI3K, which signals to the AKT
pathway promoting survival of mutant BRAF melanoma cells treated with
vemurafenib. Treatment with the anti-ERBB3 monoclonal antibody
huHER3-8 outcompetes NRG1 and prevents the activation of ERBB3 and
AKT signaling and enhances the efﬁcacy of vemurafenib treatment.

antitumor actions of trastuzumab (33). The ability of ERBB3targeting antibodies to induce ADCC may also contribute to
antitumor effects in patients with mutant BRAF melanoma,
indicating an advantage of incorporating targeted antibodies
into combinatorial approaches.
The recent approval of the dabrafenib and trametinib combination has provided a clinical beneﬁt to patients harboring
BRAFV600E melanoma. However, the response is heterogeneous
and the majority of patients (59%) still progress within 1 year
while on treatment (6), indicating that adaptive responses still
contribute to tumor survival. Upregulated ERBB3 signaling
following RAF/MEK inhibition was also inhibited by huHER3-8
(Supplementary Fig. S5C). Therefore, as the treatments for
targeting the ERK1/2 pathway evolve, ERBB3-targeting antibodies should be considered to improve efﬁcacy of treatment
and possibly increase the number of long-term responses seen
in patients. Importantly, our studies extend beyond melanoma
