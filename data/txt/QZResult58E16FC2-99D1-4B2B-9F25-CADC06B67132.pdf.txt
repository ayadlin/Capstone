Abstract
Patients with lung tumors harboring activating mutations in
the EGF receptor (EGFR) show good initial treatment
responses to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) erlotinib or geﬁtinib. However, acquired resistance invariably develops. Applying a focused shRNA screening approach to identify
genes whose knockdown can prevent and/or overcome
acquired resistance to erlotinib in several EGFR-mutant
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we identiﬁed
casein kinase 1 a (CSNK1A1, CK1a). We found that CK1a
suppression inhibits the NF-kB prosurvival signaling pathway.

Furthermore, downregulation of NF-kB signaling by approaches independent of CK1a knockdown can also attenuate
acquired erlotinib resistance, supporting a role for activated
NF-kB signaling in conferring acquired drug resistance. Importantly, CK1a suppression prevented erlotinib resistance in an
HCC827 xenograft model in vivo. Our ﬁndings suggest that
patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC might beneﬁt from a
combination of EGFR TKIs and CK1a inhibition to prevent
acquired drug resistance and to prolong disease-free survival.

Introduction

ondary mutations in the drug target, such as the T790M mutation
in EGFR, observed in 50% of EGFR-mutant lung cancers with
acquired resistance (5–7). Alternatively, key downstream signaling pathways can be reactivated through mechanisms independent of the original target, for example, through mutational
activation of components of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways or through activation of bypass RTKs, such as MET (8–10),
ErbB2 (11), IGF1R (12–14), FGFR1 (15), or AXL (16, 17).
Furthermore, activation of alternative pathways, such as upregulation of the prosurvival NF-kB signaling pathway, as well as a
switch from epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell morphology (EMT)
have been connected to both intrinsic and acquired resistance
to EGFR TKIs (16, 18, 19).
Cancer cell lines used to model acquired resistance show initial
sensitivity to the drug and undergo apoptosis, similar to the initial
treatment response observed in patients with cancer. However, as
in patients, the treatment response in cell lines is rarely complete,
resulting in a subpopulation of initially quiescent drug-tolerant
persisters (DTP), that eventually start proliferating in the presence
of the drug and give rise to a drug-resistant cell population
(3, 20, 21). In such initially drug-sensitive cancer cell lines, genetic
loss-of-function screens have been successfully applied to identify
genes whose suppression can confer resistance to the drug
(22–25). Loss-of-function screens to identify genes whose suppression enhance drug treatment and thereby potentially prevent drug tolerance or drug resistance are more challenging in
these cell line models. This is due to the fact that only a small
subpopulation of DTPs survives drug treatment, thus making it
more difﬁcult to achieve a high representation of individual
shRNAs and a robust signal-to-noise ratio in the screen.
Using loss-of-function genetic screens, we identiﬁed that suppression of casein kinase 1 a (CSNK1A1, CK1a) can prevent

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Approximately 85% of lung carcinomas are non–small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC), with adenocarcinoma representing the
most frequently occurring histologic subtype (1). About 10% to
40% of patients with adenocarcinoma harbor activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene EGF receptor
(EGFR) and frequently show good initial responses to treatment
with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) erlotinib and
geﬁtinib (1, 2). However, most patients eventually acquire resistance, resulting in a modest overall survival beneﬁt compared
with standard chemotherapeutics (1).
Modeling acquired resistance in cancer cell line models and
examining relapsed patient tumor samples has identiﬁed both
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of resistance to EGFR targeted
TKIs (3, 4). Most frequently, acquired resistance is achieved
through reactivation of signaling pathways that were originally
suppressed by RTK inhibition (3, 4). This can result from sec-

and/or overcome erlotinib resistance in several erlotinib-sensitive, EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines. Suppression of CK1a inhibits the NF-kB signaling pathway. Moreover, direct downregulation of NF-kB signaling, by approaches independent of CK1a
suppression, also attenuates the development of acquired resistance to erlotinib, supporting a role for activated NF-kB signaling
in conferring erlotinib resistance. Importantly, suppression of
CK1a can also prevent resistance to erlotinib in an HCC827
xenograft model in vivo, making CK1a a potential novel target
to attenuate resistance to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
HCC827, HCC4006, HCC2935, H3255, and HEK293T cells
were obtained and cultured as recommended by the ATCC. PC9
cells were kindly provided by Prof. Nishio (Kinki University of
Medicine, Osaka, Japan) and cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). All cell lines were authenticated by
SNP ﬁngerprinting and used for experiments within 20 passages.
Generation of lentiviruses
Viral constructs were packaged in HEK293T cells plated at 80%
to 90% conﬂuency in a 10-cm culture dish by cotransfection with
2.4 mg of shRNA-encoding plasmid, 0.6 mg of VSV-G envelope
plasmid, and 2.4 mg of D8.9 (gag/pol/rev) packaging plasmid,
using TransIT-293 reagent (Mirus) for transfection. Growth media
were exchanged the following day and lentivirus-containing
supernatant was harvested 48 hours later. Target cell lines were
transduced at MOI < 0.5.
RNAi
shRNA sequences were designed to include EcoRI and AgeI
restriction sites to allow subsequent cloning into the pLKO-TetOn inducible vector system in which the H1-TetO promoter had
been replaced with U6-TetO. The CTCGAG stem loop was used for
shNTC. For shCK1a#1, shCK1a#2, shCK1a#3, and shCK1a#4,
the Cellecta stem loop sequence GTTAATATTCATAGC was used
for the top oligonucleotide and GCTATGAATATTAAC for the
bottom oligonucleotide. The sequences of the oligonucleotides
used are as follows from 50 to 30 :
shCK1a#1-top: CCGGCATCTATTTGGCGATTAACATGTTAATATTCATAGCATGTTGATCGCCAAATAGATGTTTTT; shCK1a#1bottom: AATTAAAAACATCTATTTGGCGATCAACATGCTATGAATATTAACATGTTAATCGCCAAATAGATG; shCK1a#2-top: CCGGCTGCCTGTTTAATTGTGTTAGGTTAATATTCATAGCCTAGCACAATTAAGCAGGCAGTTTTT; shCK1a#2-bottom: AATTAAAAACTGCCTGCTTAATTGTGCTAGGCTATGAATATTAACCTAACACAATTAAACAGGCAG; shCK1a#3-top: CCGGCTGTACGAGAGTAAGCTTTATGTTAATATTCATAGCATAGAGCTTGCTCTCGTACAGTTTTT; shCK1a#3-bottom: AATTAAAAACTGTACGAGAGCAAGCTCTATGCTATGAATATTAACATAAAGCTTACTCTCGTACAG;

line–speciﬁc off-target effect(s). Therefore, shCK1a#4 was used in
HCC4006 cells. For viral transduction, 200,000 cells were plated
per 6-well dish, and virus-containing medium with 8 mg/mL
polybrene (Millipore) was added the following day. Twenty-four
hours later, fresh medium containing 2 mg/mL puromycin was
added, and cells were cultured for 1 week to eliminate nontransduced cells. shRNAs were induced with 100 ng/mL doxycycline
(Clontech).
Ectopic expression of mCK1a and IkBa superrepressor alleles
The kinase-dead mCK1a (D136N) was generated from the
murine CK1a-cDNA construct (Life Technologies, clone ID:
IOM18458), using the Q5 Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) with primers 50 -TATACACAGAAACATTAAACCAG-30 and
50 -AAATTCTTTGTATGCACATATTC-30 . Additional silent mutations were added to further increase the resistance of murine
CK1a to CK1a-shRNA#1 and #3 using the primers 50 -AATATAACCAATGGCGAGGAAGTG-30 and 50 -TATGGCTAGATAAATGTCCCCGAAAGAG-30 as well as 50 -TAAACTGTACAAGATTCTTCAAGGTGGGGTTG-30 and 50 -CTTTCGTACAGCAACTGGGGATGCCTGGC-30 , respectively. The stop codon was deleted with primers 50 -TACCCAGCTTTCTTGTAC-30 and 50 -GAAACCTGTGGGGGTTTG-30 , and constructs were cloned into pLenti6.3-V5-CMV
plasmid (Life Technologies) to generate V5-tagged fusion constructs. Plasmids were packaged into lentiviral particles, and after
infection, cells were selected with 25 mg/mL blasticidin for 1 week
to eliminate nontransduced cells. IkBa superrepressor was cloned
into a tetracycline-inducible pLKO-TREX plasmid. Lentivirustransduced cells were selected with 2 mg/mL puromycin. Expression of the IkBa superrepressor was induced with 100 ng/mL
doxycycline (Clontech).
shRNA screen
A custom shRNA library containing 6,500 shRNAs against
350 potentially cancer-relevant genes (17 shRNAs per gene)
described previously (26) was screened. Cells were transduced at
an MOI of 0.5. Selection with 2 mg/mL puromycin was started 24
hours after transduction and continued for 72 hours. Cells were
trypsinized and the percentage of positively transduced cells was
more than 90% for all cell lines screened as tested by RFP
expression. Fifteen million cells, representing the baseline of
shRNA representation, were harvested. The remaining cells were
plated for DMSO or 2 mmol/L erlotinib treatment, respectively.
DMSO-treated cells were split every 3 days, and at each time point,
20 million cells were replated. Erlotinib-treated cells were
retreated with fresh media and compound every 3 days. After
10 and 24 days of treatment, respectively, at least 15 million cells
were harvested per condition, ensuring a representation of more
than 2,000 cells per shRNA. Puriﬁcation of gDNA, PCR for library
production, and next-generation sequencing were performed as
described previously (26). Screens for all cell lines and conditions
were performed in duplicate.
shRNA screen data analysis
Sequencing counts from each sample were normalized to
15 million reads. The fold change of shRNA representation in
erlotinib-treated versus DMSO-treated condition was calculated.
In addition, the fold change of shRNA representation in DMSOtreated versus baseline condition was calculated to estimate
the effects of shRNAs on cell proliferation. A robust z-score was

CK1a Inhibition Prevents Erlotinib Resistance

calculated using the median and MAD for the calculated fold
changes across the entire shRNA library. For gene-based hit
calling, two statistical measures were used, redundant siRNA
activity (RSA; ref. 27) and Q1-z-score (26, 28). The RSA score is
a statistical score (P value) representing the probability of a gene
hit based on the collective activities of multiple shRNAs per gene.
It is a measure of how signiﬁcantly the rank order of shRNAs
against a given gene differs from the population of other shRNAs
in the library. In this approach, genes with multiple moderately
active shRNAs score higher than genes with few but highly active
shRNAs (27). The Q1-z-score represents the z-score of the shRNA
at the ﬁrst quartile (Q1), that is, the z-score of the fourth best (in a
library that contains an average of 16–17 shRNAs per gene)
performing shRNA per gene. By using both RSA-score and
Q1-z-score for hit calling, the most robust hits with both consistent and high shRNA activity are identiﬁed.
Cell viability and proliferation analysis
For short-term cell viability assays, 2,000 to 4,000 cells were
seeded in triplicate in 96 wells 1 day before compound addition
and incubated for 5 days with various concentrations of compounds. Cell viability was determined by CellTiter-Glo Luminescence Assay (Promega). Luminescence signal was recorded on an
EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer), and the inhibition of viability relative to DMSO-treated cells was calculated. For long-term
colony formation assays, 100,000 to 200,000 cells were plated per
6-well the day before the start of treatment. Cells were retreated
with fresh media with or without compound every 3 days until the
appropriate conﬂuency as estimated by the control condition was
reached. Each condition was done in triplicate. Plates were stained
with 0.2% crystal violet/10% formaline, and crystal violet signal
was quantiﬁed on Odyssey CLx (LI-COR) at 700 nm. To measure
proliferation over time, cells were plated at 10,000 cells per well in
a 24-well plate in triplicate. Twenty-four hours later, the indicated
treatment was started and conﬂuency measurements were taken
every 12 hours using an Incucyte Kinetic Imaging System (Essen
BioScience).

to cell viability assessed by CellTiter-Glo Luminescence Assay
(Promega).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).
cDNA was generated using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad).
The qRT-PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan Universal
PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies) and were run on 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probes for
Serpine1, TNFa, and b-actin were purchased from Life Technologies. All experiments were performed in triplicate and normalized to b-actin transcript levels using comparative CT method.
Microarray analysis
HCC827 and PC9 cells were treated for 8 or 30 days with DMSO
or 2 mmol/L erlotinib. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen). Gene expression proﬁling was performed
using Affymetrix U133Plus2 Arrays and data were analyzed as
described previously (29). Differential analysis was performed by
computing fold changes of erlotinib treatment relative to DMSO.
The data have been deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology information (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with the
accession number GSE67051). GeneGo pathway enrichment
analysis was performed to identify differentially regulated pathways between treated and untreated conditions.
Immunoblotting
Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer, and immunoblot analysis
was performed using standard methods. The following antibodies
were used: CK1a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6477), V5 (Invitrogen, 46-0705), GAPDH (Millipore, MAB374), pERK (T202,
Y204; CST, 4377S), ERK (CST, 4695S), pAKT (S473; CST, 4058L),
AKT (CST, 4685S), pEGFR (Y1086; Abcam, ab32086), EGFR
(CST, 4267S), and cleaved PARP (Asp214; CST, 5625S).

Luciferase assay
Cell lines stably expressing an NF-kB luciferase reporter plasmid (pLenti6-NF-kB-Luc2P) or a WNT-responsive Super-Topﬂash
(STF) luciferase reporter plasmid (pLenti6-STF) were generated by
lentiviral infection. Four thousand cells per 96-well were plated
and the luciferase signal was measured after 4 days using Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and normalized to cell viability
assessed by CellTiter-Glo Luminescence Assay (Promega). For
transient NF-kB luciferase reporter assays, cells were cotransfected
with ﬁreﬂy luciferase construct driven by NF-kB–binding
sequences (pTranslucent-NFkBI-Luc) and Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-SV40-Renilla) at a ratio of 25 to 1. Luciferase signal was
measured using Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega)
48 hours after transfection, and ﬁreﬂy luciferase signal was normalized to Renilla luciferase signal. All conditions were done in
triplicate.

Xenograft studies
Mice were handled in accordance with the Novartis Institutes
for BioMedical Research (NIBR) Animal Care and Use Committee
protocols and regulations. Ten million cells in 50% Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) were implanted subcutaneously into female athymic
nude mice (20–25 g; 7–8 weeks old). The cells were free of
mycoplasma and viral contamination (IMPACT VIII PCR Proﬁle,
IDEXX BioResearch). Treatment with compound (formulation
40% Captisol, 0.1 mol/L tartaric acid) and doxycycline-supplemented food (PharmaServ diet #5SL5: PharmaServ 5053 with 400
PPM doxycycline) started 10 to 14 days after implant when
average tumor volume reached approximately 350 mm3. Animals
were administered once daily with vehicle or erlotinib (LC Laboratories; 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg, oral) for the duration of the study.
Tumor volume was measured using calipers and calculated as
(length  width  width)/2. At the end of the study and 1 hour
after the last dose, tumor tissues were excised and snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen for biomarker analysis.

Results
shRNA screening identiﬁes CK1a as a synergizer with erlotinib
in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells
To identify novel genes involved in acquired resistance to the
EGFR TKI erlotinib, we performed loss-of-function genetic
screens in several EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines in the presence or absence of the drug. We screened three EGFR-mutant

NSCLC cell lines, HCC827, HCC4006, and PC9 cells, all of
which are highly sensitive to erlotinib (Fig. 1A, left and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) but acquire resistance upon
long-term treatment with the drug. We purposely chose highly
drug-sensitive cell lines in which treatment with the clinically
relevant dose of 2 mmol/L erlotinib allows only the survival
of a small subpopulation of DTPs, as an enhancer screen in

CK1a Inhibition Prevents Erlotinib Resistance

such cell models has the potential to identify genes whose
knockdown can prevent the occurrence of DTPs and thereby
prevent drug resistance in the long-term. In addition, to identify
genes whose knockdown can overcome drug resistance, we
screened an erlotinib-resistant PC9 cell line generated by continuous treatment and then maintained with a clinically relevant dose of erlotinib (2 mmol/L; Fig. 1A, right and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). Importantly, as described previously, erlotinib-resistant PC9 cells did not show any additional
resistance conferring mutations in the EGFR gene or in other
genes when analyzed by RNA sequencing (data not shown;
ref. 20). We then screened a focused, deep coverage (17 shRNAs
per gene) shRNA library of 6,500 shRNAs against about 350
potentially cancer-relevant genes (Supplementary Table S1;
ref. 26). The deep-coverage shRNA library of 17 shRNAs per
gene enables high-conﬁdence hit calling at the gene level rather
than analysis of individual shRNAs in the dataset. HCC827,
HCC4006, PC9 cells, and erlotinib-resistant PC9 cells were
infected with shRNA library containing lentiviral particles and
library-infected cells were cultured for 10 or 24 days in the
absence or presence of 2 mmol/L erlotinib (Fig. 1A), corresponding to approximately 50-fold of the IC50 in the cell lines
used (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). To avoid the follow-up
of cell line speciﬁc as opposed to more generalizable phenotypes, we focused on shRNA dropout hits that were shared
across several NSCLC cell lines. We prioritized those hits that
came up in the 10-day treatment condition, as long-term
culture can increase the noise of shRNA data.
Using these criteria for hit selection, CK1a (CSNK1A1) was
identiﬁed as a novel dropout hit that decreased cell survival
in the presence of erlotinib in parental HCC827, HCC4006,
and PC9 cells, as well as in erlotinib-resistant PC9 cells (Fig. 1B
and Supplementary Fig. S3). In the presence of DMSO, CK1a
shRNAs dropped out only in PC9 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2),
explaining the lower scores of CK1a in PC9 in the comparison
of erlotinib versus DMSO treatment (Fig. 1B). Other isoforms
of the CK1 family represented in the shRNA library, namely
CSNK1D (CK1d) and CSNK1E (CK1e), did not exhibit significant dropout in the presence of erlotinib (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting a speciﬁc role of CK1a in
resistance to erlotinib.
Suppression of CK1a increases the maximum dose response
and enhances the apoptotic response to erlotinib
To further conﬁrm the role of CK1a in cell survival in the
presence of erlotinib, we generated stable cell lines expressing
three independent doxycycline-inducible shRNAs against CK1a
or a nontargeting control (NTC) shRNA. Cells were initially
treated with or without doxycycline for 72 hours to induce
knockdown of CK1a. Subsequently, cells were plated in the
presence or absence of doxycycline and treated with different
concentrations of erlotinib for 5 days. Knockdown of CK1a
increased the maximum dose response (Amax) to erlotinib in
HCC827 and HCC4006 cells and sensitized erlotinib-resistant
PC9 cells to the drug in this short-term assay (Fig. 2A). No
separation of the dose–response curves was detectable upon
knockdown of CK1a in the presence of doxorubicin or cisplatin,
suggesting that CK1a knockdown speciﬁcally increases the
response to erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Because knockdown of CK1a speciﬁcally increased the
Amax rather than shift the IC50 in combination with erlotinib,

www.aacrjournals.org

the effect of CK1a knockdown on the apoptotic response to
erlotinib was examined. Indeed, knockdown of CK1a enhanced apoptosis in the presence of erlotinib in HCC827,
HCC4006, and erlotinib-resistant PC9 cells, as shown by
increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 2B) and increased caspase-3/7
activity (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these ﬁndings indicate that
knockdown of CK1a increases the maximum dose response,
at least in part, by increasing the extent of the apoptotic
response to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.
Knockdown of CK1a attenuates resistance to erlotinib in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells
To determine the effects of CK1a knockdown on the development of resistance to erlotinib in long-term colony formation assays, cell lines generated to express doxycycline-inducible CK1a- or NTC-shRNAs were cultured in erlotinib in the
presence or absence of doxycycline until colonies formed
(generally 21–35 days). Strikingly, in this long-term assay,
CK1a knockdown attenuated the development of resistance
to erlotinib in HCC827, HCC4006, and PC9 cells. The effects
of CK1a knockdown on cell proliferation in the absence
of erlotinib were less pronounced, with no signiﬁcant effect
in HCC827 cells, but moderate and signiﬁcant effects in
HCC4006 and PC9 cells (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig.
S5A). Interestingly, knockdown of CK1a was also effective
when induced in DTPs, that is, after initial erlotinib treatment
for 8 days, showing that CK1a knockdown can also attenuate
the outgrowth of DTPs to resistant clones (Supplementary Fig.
S6A, right), in addition to preventing the emergence of DTPs
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S6A, left). Furthermore,
knockdown of CK1a inhibited the proliferation of resistant
PC9 cells, and this effect was more pronounced in the presence
than in the absence of erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S6B). In
addition, the CK1a inhibitor D4476 (30) in combination with
erlotinib attenuated resistance to erlotinib in HCC827,
HCC4006, and PC9 cells, albeit with modest effects on cell
proliferation when D4476 was used as a single agent (Supplementary Fig. S7). We extended the ﬁnding that CK1a knockdown attenuates acquired resistance to erlotinib to two additional EGFR-mutant and erlotinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines,
HCC2935 and H3255, that were not part of the shRNA screen
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figs. S1A, S1B, and S5B). Taken
together, these data suggest that inhibition of CK1a can attenuate resistance to erlotinib across a panel of EGFR-mutant
NSCLC cell lines and that the synergy between CK1a inhibition
and erlotinib represents a general mechanism.
We next tested whether the effect of CK1a knockdown on
preventing resistance to erlotinib could be reversed by ectopic
expression of CK1a. To this end, we generated cell lines that
stably express V5-tagged shRNA-resistant murine wild-type
or kinase-dead mCK1a cDNA (31) and doxycycline-inducible CK1a- or NTC-shRNAs. As shown in Fig. 3D, shRNAresistant mCK1a-V5 was refractory to knockdown by the
human speciﬁc CK1a-shRNAs, and wild-type and kinase-dead
mCK1a-V5 were expressed at similar levels. Importantly,
expression of wild-type mCK1a-V5, but not kinase-dead

Knockdown of CK1a does not affect the MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT
survival pathways, neither does it inhibit Wnt signaling
Resistance to erlotinib often results from reactivation of key
downstream signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT and
MEK/ERK pathways. This is particularly true in the case of
erlotinib-resistant PC9 cells, which downregulate pEGFR but
maintain robust activation of pERK and pAKT even in the
presence of erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S8, bottom right).
To rule out a direct effect of CK1a on ERK/AKT signaling, we
investigated pERK and pAKT levels upon CK1a knockdown in
the erlotinib-resistant PC9 cells. pERK and pAKT levels were
not signiﬁcantly affected by CK1a knockdown either in the
presence or absence of erlotinib, suggesting an ERK/AKT pathway–independent mechanism for the synergy between CK1a
knockdown and erlotinib treatment (Supplementary Fig. S8,
bottom right). Consistent with these ﬁndings, CK1a knockdown also did not affect pERK, pAKT, or pEGFR levels in
HCC827, HCC4006, and PC9 cells under acute treatment
in the presence or absence of erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Previous studies have shown that CK1a, by virtue of being
part of the b-catenin destruction complex, plays a role in WNT
pathway regulation, with CK1a knockdown activating WNT
signaling in the gut (32–34). However, CK1a knockdown did
not activate WNT signaling in HCC827 and PC9 cells as
measured by a WNT-responsive Super-Topﬂash (STF) luciferase
reporter assay (Supplementary Fig. S9), thereby excluding WNT
pathway deregulation as the mechanism for preventing resistance to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Consistently,
GeneGo pathway enrichment analysis of erlotinib- versus
DMSO-treated HCC827 and PC9 cells did not suggest altered WNT signaling upon erlotinib treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S10A and S10B).
Knockdown of CK1a decreases NF-kB signaling and inhibition
of NF-kB signaling attenuates resistance to erlotinib
CK1a has been implicated in several cellular signaling pathways (35). To better understand the effect of erlotinib on EGFRmutant NSCLC cells, we generated microarray data from NSCLC
cells treated for 8 days (DTP) or 30 days (resistant cells) with
2 mmol/L erlotinib. GeneGO pathway enrichment analysis of
erlotinib- versus DMSO-treated cells revealed a prominent upregulation of NF-kB signaling in DTPs and in erlotinib-resistant cells
(Supplementary Fig. S10A and S10B). On the basis of these
ﬁndings, we hypothesized that upregulation of NF-kB signaling
contributes to tolerance/resistance to erlotinib and that
knockdown of CK1a attenuates resistance to erlotinib through
downregulation of NF-kB signaling. To test this hypothesis, we
generated HCC827 and PC9 cell lines stably expressing both an
NF-kB luciferase reporter and doxycycline-inducible CK1a- or
NTC-shRNAs. Knockdown of CK1a signiﬁcantly decreased the
NF-kB luciferase reporter signal (Fig. 4A). Consistent with these
ﬁndings, CK1a knockdown reduced the expression of the NF-kB
target genes TNFa and Serpine1 in the presence of erlotinib
(Supplementary Fig. S10C).
On the basis of these results, we next investigated whether
inhibition of NF-kB signaling by independent approaches
would prevent resistance to erlotinib. To this end, we generated
cell lines expressing a doxycycline-inducible dominant-negative version of IkBa, the IkBa superrepressor. Two point mutations at serine 32 and serine 36 to alanine in the IkBa superrepressor prohibit phosphorylation and thus degradation of

4944 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

IkBa, thereby inhibiting NF-kB signaling (36). Indeed, induction of the IkBa superrepressor by doxycycline decreased NF-kB
signaling, as measured by NF-kB luciferase reporter assay
(Fig. 4B). Importantly, expression of the IkBa superrepressor
attenuated resistance to erlotinib in HCC827 and PC9 cells,
whereas it only modestly affected cell proliferation in the
absence of erlotinib (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S11A and
S11B). These ﬁndings recapitulated the observations made for
CK1a knockdown, which also downregulated NF-kB signaling
and attenuated resistance to erlotinib.
Underscoring the importance of the NF-kB signaling pathway
in acquired resistance, combination treatment with erlotinib
and AFN700, an inhibitor of IkB kinase (IKKb; refs. 37, 38), the
primary kinase promoting IkBa phosphorylation and NF-kB
activation, attenuated resistance to erlotinib in HCC827,
HCC4006, and PC9 cells at concentrations where AFN700 alone
did not affect cell proliferation (Fig. 4C and Supplementary
Fig. S11C and S11D). Furthermore, treatment with AFN700
inhibited proliferation of resistant PC9 cells and this effect was
more pronounced in the presence than in the absence of
erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S11E), suggesting that resistant
PC9 cells depend on activated NF-kB pathway for survival and
that erlotinib modulates this dependency.
In summary, our data show that the development of drug
tolerance to erlotinib is associated with activated NF-kB signaling
in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines and that downregulation
of NF-kB signaling by CK1a knockdown, as well as by other
approaches can attenuate resistance to erlotinib.
Knockdown of CK1a attenuates resistance to erlotinib in an
HCC827 xenograft model
Because knockdown of CK1a attenuated acquired resistance
in vitro, we next investigated whether CK1a knockdown could
affect resistance to erlotinib in vivo. In an initial experiment,
we determined the minimum dose of erlotinib that was sufﬁcient to achieve maximum HCC827 tumor regression in vivo
to be 5 mg/kg (Fig. 5A). Treatment of mice with 5 mg/kg
erlotinib reduced pEGFR levels, demonstrating the effectiveness
of 5 mg/kg erlotinib on target modulation in vivo (Fig. 5B). In
addition, two CK1a-shRNAs, but not the NTC-shRNA, induced
robust knockdown of CK1a in vivo (Fig. 5B). Mice harboring
HCC827-derived tumors expressing doxycycline-inducible
CK1a- or NTC-shRNAs were kept on a diet supplemented with
or without doxycycline and dosed daily with vehicle or 5 mg/kg
erlotinib. As shown in Fig. 5C, CK1a knockdown alone did
not affect tumor growth in the vehicle treatment group. Treatment of mice with 5 mg/kg erlotinib strongly inhibited tumor
growth (relative to vehicle treatment), with resistance to erlotinib
starting to emerge after approximately 70 days of erlotinib treatment. Importantly, expression of two independent CK1ashRNAs but not of the NTC-shRNA prevented the emergence of
resistance to erlotinib in the HCC827 xenograft model (Fig. 5C).
These in vivo data further support a role for CK1a as a potential
target to prevent resistance to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

Discussion
We used a loss-of-function screening approach to investigate
mechanisms of acquired resistance to erlotinib across a panel of
EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. CK1a was identiﬁed as a novel hit
whose knockdown could both prevent and overcome acquired

resistance to erlotinib. Suppression of CK1a downregulated the
prosurvival NF-kB signaling pathway and NF-kB signaling was
upregulated in erlotinib-treated drug-tolerant NSCLC cells and in
resistant PC9 cells. In addition, inhibition of NF-kB signaling by
approaches independent of CK1a suppression similarly attenuated resistance to erlotinib, supporting a causal link between
increased NF-kB signaling and erlotinib resistance. Importantly,
suppression of CK1a in vivo also prevented resistance to erlotinib
in an HCC827 xenograft model. Together, our data suggest CK1a
inhibition as a novel combination treatment strategy with EGFR
TKIs to attenuate acquired resistance in patients with lung cancer
harboring activating EGFR mutations.

Functional shRNA screens have been successfully used in the
past to identify novel players in drug resistance. Several factors
determine the quality of shRNA screen data and the ability for
high-conﬁdence hit calling. First, the use of deep-coverage shRNA
libraries, in our case 17 shRNAs per gene, reduces the likelihood
of false-positive hit calling (39). Second, the recovery of sufﬁciently high cell numbers at the end of the screen is necessary to
ensure a high representation of each shRNA in the library and to
reduce noise in the screen (39). And third, screening a panel of
cell lines of the same lineage helps to avoid the follow-up of cell
line speciﬁc as opposed to more generalizable phenotypes. In
drug-sensitive cell lines, drug treatment often kills the bulk

CK1a Inhibition Prevents Erlotinib Resistance

population (20), hampering the recovery of sufﬁcient shRNAs per
gene. Therefore, most shRNA screens to date have been set up to
identify genes whose knockdown confers acquired resistance, for
which gene hits can also be identiﬁed at lower shRNA representation (22–25). Alternatively, shRNA screens with the aim
to identify drop-out hits have mostly been applied in cell
line models of intrinsic resistance that lack drug sensitivity
(18, 40, 41). In contrast, we successfully performed drop-out
shRNA screens in a panel of drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC
cells of acquired resistance in the presence of clinically relevant
erlotinib concentrations. One challenge of this approach is
that it requires the handling of initially large cell numbers to
account for the treatment-induced cell loss throughout the screen
and is therefore more applicable for screening of focused as
opposed to genome-wide shRNA libraries. Nonetheless, this
screening approach is highly valuable, as it can inform new
combination treatment strategies. In our study, it identiﬁed CK1a
as a potential novel target to prevent resistance to erlotinib in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
CK1a has previously been shown to play a role in NF-kB
signaling pathway in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL;
ref. 31). Suppression of CK1a was selectively lethal for activated
B-cell–like DLBCL cells that rely on constitutive NF-kB activation
for proliferation and survival, but not for NF-kB pathway independent germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL cells (31, 42). We
demonstrate that suppression of CK1a can downregulate NF-kB
pathway activity in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells and attenuate
resistance to erlotinib. Furthermore, we show that DTPs and
resistant PC9 cells show NF-kB activation and that downregulation of NF-kB signaling, through expression of the IkBa superrepressor or through treatment with an IKKb inhibitor, can
attenuate resistance to erlotinib. Together, these ﬁndings suggest
a causal role for activated NF-kB signaling in resistance to erlotinib
and provide evidence that inhibition of NF-kB signaling can
attenuate resistance to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.
Accordingly, it has been described previously that the extent of
NF-kB activity may determine the response to EGFR TKI treatment
in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer, with low IkB expression, an indicator of high NF-kB activation, being predictive of
worse progression-free survival and decreased overall survival of
patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib
(18). Furthermore, adaptive NF-kB activation has recently been

shown to enable survival of NSCLC cells upon initial EGFRtargeted therapy, thereby allowing tumor cell persistence manifesting as an incomplete tumor response that may ultimately
promote acquired resistance (19).
The present ﬁnding that CK1a knockdown is able to prevent as
well as overcome acquired resistance to erlotinib opens up some
interesting possibilities. Previous studies have shown that a variety of resistance mechanisms operate to drive acquired resistance
to erlotinib and that these can frequently co-occur in patients,
suggesting that completely overcoming all resistance mechanisms
in a patient may be extremely difﬁcult (4). Thus, preventing
acquired resistance has a better chance of being curative. In this
regard, the preventative potential of targeting CK1a in EGFRmutant NSCLC may be well worth exploring further.
