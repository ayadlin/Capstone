ABSTRACT
Dysregulation of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform one (NHE1) activity is a hallmark
of cells undergoing tumorigenesis and metastasis, the leading cause of patient
mortality. The acidic tumor microenvironment is thought to facilitate the development
of resistance to chemotherapy drugs and to promote extracellular matrix remodeling
leading to metastasis. Here, we investigated NHE1 as a co-adjuvant target in paclitaxel
chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer. We generated a stable NHE1-knockout
of the highly invasive, triple-negative, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The NHE1knockout cells proliferated comparably to parental cells, but had markedly lower rates
of migration and invasion in vitro. In vivo xenograft tumor growth in athymic nude
mice was also dramatically decreased compared to parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Loss
of NHE1 expression also increased the susceptibility of knockout cells to paclitaxelmediated cell death. NHE1 inhibition, in combination with paclitaxel, resulted in a
dramatic decrease in viability, and migratory and invasive potential of triple-negative
breast cancer cells, but not in hormone receptor-positive, luminal MCF7 cells. Our
data suggest that NHE1 is critical in triple-negative breast cancer metastasis, and its
chemical inhibition boosts the efficacy of paclitaxel in vitro, highlighting NHE1 as a
novel, potential co-adjuvant target in breast cancer chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

of various cell types including aortic and liver tissues, and
cardiomyocytes, suggesting that it is also involved in the
modulation of intranuclear pH [2]. Regulation of NHE1
activity is thus critical and tightly controlled by multiple
signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK, ERK1/2), and initiated
by growth factors or hormonal stimulation that either
directly or indirectly affect the phosphorylation state of
its C-terminal domain. In addition, several intracellular
proteins and lipids (e.g. PIP2, CHP1/2/3, actin binding
proteins ezrin-radixin-moesin, calmodulin, carbonic
anhydrase II) regulate Na+/H+ exchange via interaction
with the C-terminal tail of NHE1 [3]. Whether all these
protein and lipid associations are retained in breast cancer
cells is not clear [4].
In neoplastic cells, NHE1 activity is of special
importance. The dysregulation of NHE1 activity is now
considered a hallmark of cells undergoing tumorigenesis.
NHE1 becomes constitutively active in the transformed

In normal and neoplastic cells, the maintenance
of pH homeostasis is chiefly regulated by the Na+/H+
exchanger isoform one (NHE1). NHE1 is a ubiquitously
expressed, integral plasma membrane protein comprised of
a membrane-traversing domain that facilitates ion flux, and
a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain that regulates exchanger
activity. Ion flux occurs with the electroneutral exchange
of one intracellular proton for one extracellular sodium
ion, and is driven by the transmembrane Na+ gradient. In
conditions of low intracellular pH (pHi), excess protons
allosterically activate NHE1, facilitating proton extrusion
and a return to homeostatic pHi. NHE1 activity therefore
maintains pHi and has been shown to play an important
role in the regulation of cell volume and shape, while also
promoting cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis [1]. NHE1 is present on the nuclear membranes

phenotype, resulting in a reversal of the normal pH
gradient in many cancer cells. This raises pHi with a
concomitant decrease in extracellular pH. The low
extracellular pH (pHe) and decreased vascularization
associated with rapid tumor growth also stimulate directed
cell migration and invasion, resulting in the metastatic
dissemination of tumor cells to sites distant from the
primary tumor [5]. Importantly, the acidic extracellular
microenvironment stimulates extracellular protease
activity, extracellular matrix remodeling and cell invasion
[6]. It may also contribute to the development of multidrug
resistance of tumor cells to many chemotherapy drugs,
which also hinders immune rejection of these tumors [7].
Weakly basic chemotherapy agents (e.g. doxorubicin)
are likely protonated in acidic pHe, which impedes their
entrance into cells and prevents them from reaching their
intracellular molecular targets [8, 9]. In mice, xenograft
tumors of lowly invasive MCF7 breast cancer cells were
much more sensitive to doxorubicin at an extracellular
pH of 7.4 than 6.8 in vivo [10]. Paclitaxel, which has a
complex structure that includes both an acidic and basic
domain, is also less cytotoxic at low pHe [11]. To date,
there is no evidence to suggest that pharmacological
inhibitors of NHE1 could be effective chemotherapy
agents in humans [12]. However, it stands to reason that
manipulating the tumor microenvironment through the
modulation of NHE1 activity could aid in chemotherapy
treatment strategies in a co-adjuvant manner post-surgical
intervention or, alternatively, in a co-neoadjuvant manner
prior to surgery.
The initial development of NHE1-specific inhibitors
was driven by the need to counter the adverse effects
of excessive exchanger activity in the mammalian
myocardium. Amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic
that has been used clinically, is a NHE inhibitor [13,
14]. Several other drugs have since been developed and
investigated in terms of their increased selectivity and
potency towards NHE1 inhibition [15]. Testing these
NHE1 inhibitors for their anti-cancer properties is ongoing
[16]. The two major families of these compounds are:
the pyrazine derivatives (e.g. 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)
amiloride), 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride, 5-(N-ethyl-Nisopropyl-amiloride)), and the benzoylguanidines (e.g.
cariporide, eniporide, HOE-694) [13]. The successful use
of amiloride as an anti-cancer therapy in animal models
was recently reviewed [14].
Here, we propose that, since pH regulation is
pivotal in the switch from the normal to the neoplastic to
the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells, that inhibition
of NHE1 can be used as a target to increase the efficacy
of anti-cancer drugs. Recent studies have lent credence to
this hypothesis. One study examined MCF7 breast cancer
cells, representative of the estrogen receptor-positive
luminal subtype of breast cancer. NHE1 knockdown
or inhibition with 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride
sensitized these cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatin

[17].

Triple-negative breast cancer is a heterogeneous
disease that accounts for 10-20% of all metastatic
breast cancers. Triple-negative breast cancer lacks the
expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, and
human epithelial growth factor 2 receptors (HER2; also
known as ErbB2), and shares characteristics with basallike, claudin-low, and BRCA1-related breast cancer.
It is most commonly diagnosed in younger women (<
50 years) and ultimately results in poor prognosis [18].
To date, no targeted therapies exist for the treatment of
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer other than surgery
and cytotoxic chemotherapy, primarily with taxanes (e.g.
paclitaxel) or anthracyclines (e.g. doxorubicin) [19]. In
this study, we investigated NHE1 as a target for adjuvant
therapy in highly invasive, triple-negative breast cancer
cells. We used specific NHE1 inhibitors, HMA [5-(N,Nhexamethylene) amiloride)], representative of the
pyrazine class of amiloride derivatives, and EMD87580
[2-methyl-4,5-di-(methylsulfonyl)-benzoyl-guanidine)],
representative of the benzoylguanidines, to increase
the susceptibility of triple-negative breast cancer cells
to paclitaxel. Paclitaxel belongs to the taxane group of
pharmaceuticals that was introduced into the clinical
treatment of breast and ovarian cancer in the 1990s [20].
It is still considered the most effective treatment option
for breast cancer patients and is US-FDA approved as
a second line chemotherapy for those with advanced
metastatic disease [21]. We report that low-dose paclitaxelmediated cell death is increased by the simultaneous
administration of either EMD87580 or HMA in triplenegative breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we validate the
importance of NHE1 function by generating an NHE1knockout cell line (231-KO) for comparison with the
parental MDA-MB-231 cells that endogenously express
NHE1. The 231-KO cells showed markedly less xenograft
tumor growth than the parental MDA-MB-231 cells over
time. Taken together, our data show, for the first time, that
the chemical inhibition or loss of NHE1 expression in
invasive, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer cell lines
enhances their susceptibility to paclitaxel-mediated cell
death. This study enforces the idea that NHE1 may be key
in the development of novel, tumor microenvironmenttargeted chemotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of
triple-negative breast cancers.

RESULTS:
Na+/H+ exchange activity, but not NHE1
expression, is elevated in MDA-MB-231 (231-WT)
cells in tumor mimetic conditions
To examine the role of NHE1 in tumor cells we
made a knockout of the protein in the parental MDA1263

MB-231 cells (231-WT). Western blot analysis was
used to examine endogenous expression of NHE1 in
the NHE1-knockout (231-KO), compared to the 231WT cells, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. NHE1 was
consistently observed as a band at approximately 100
kDa in multiple lysate preparations (Fig. 1A). A second
smaller band was also observed and is typical of a
partially or de-glycosylated NHE1 protein. As expected,
the stable NHE1-knockout (231-KO) cells showed no
NHE1 protein expression. We also compared the level
of NHE1 protein in either stimulated (low-serum (0.2%)
media) or unstimulated (10%-serum supplemented media)
conditions as previously described [22]. When the level of
NHE1 was quantitatively compared to that of actin, there
was no up-regulation of NHE1 expression in any cell type
under stimulated conditions (N=5, see Fig. 1 for example).
We examined the NHE1 activity of the tumor cell
lines in stimulated or unstimulated conditions (Fig. 1B, C).
As expected, stable NHE1-knockout MDA-MB-231 (231KO) cells showed no demonstrable Na+/H+ exchanger
activity either in stimulated or unstimulated conditions.
When we examined the relative Na+/H+ exchange activity
of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 (P<0.001, N=8), and MDAMB-468 (P<0.01, N=8) breast cancer cells, we found that
it was significantly higher in cells that were serum-starved
for 24 hr. prior to measurement of pHi (Fig. 1B, C).
To further characterize differences between parental
and NHE1-knockout MDA-MB-231 cells, we studied cell
proliferation in unstimulated and stimulated conditions

over 48 hr. In serum-deprived conditions typical of the
tumor microenvironment, both 231-WT and 231-KO
cells were more proliferative compared to MCF7 and
MDA-MB-468 cells over 48 hr. (Fig. 2A; P<0.001,
N=5). There was no difference in proliferation rates
between stimulated 231-WT and 231-KO cells. All cell
types had similar rates of proliferation in unstimulated
conditions (data not shown). We also examined the effect
of increasing concentrations of paclitaxel on cell viability.
Interestingly, stimulated 231-KO cells appeared to be
more susceptible to paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity at
0.1 nM and higher concentrations (P<0.05 to P<0.001,
N=3) compared to 231-WT cells (Fig. 2B). In addition,
there were no significant changes in the viability of MCF7
and MDA-MB-468 cells in response to paclitaxel at the
tested concentrations. In other experiments, we examined
the effect of NHE1 inhibitors on cell viability. EMD87580
was not cytotoxic to cells at up to 100 μM, but high
concentrations of HMA (100 μM) resulted in less than

pH was examined in cells that were transiently acidified using

indicated for stimulated 231-WT cells (231s). An example of
recovery is indicated for unstimulated 231-WT cells (231u) and
MDA-MB-231 NHE1-knockout cells (231-KO). Fluorescence
of BCECF, a pH-sensitive indicator dye, was used to record
and quantify changes in pHi post-acute acid load induced by
ammonium chloride. NHE1 activity was calculated from the
slope of the first 20 sec of recovery from acidification and was
expressed as ∆pH/sec. C, Relative rate of Na+/H+ exchange
activity of 231-KO cells relative to 231-WT cells, and in MDAMB-468 and MCF7 cells. Values of ΔpH/sec from 231-WT and
231-KO cells were normalized to the unstimulated control values
for 231-WT cells. Data for MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 were
normalized to their control unstimulated values respectively. No
discernible exchanger activity was detected in the knockout cells.
Background drift and buffering capacity were not significantly
different between cell types. In stimulated conditions (0.2%
serum), NHE1 activity is significantly increased in 231-WT,
MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 cells [*P<0.001, +P<0.01, N=8].

with either 10 μM EMD87580 (Fig. 4A), or 10 nM HMA
(Fig 4B). This effect was significant when compared to
cells treated with paclitaxel, EMD87580, or HMA alone
at the same concentrations. Similar results were observed
in MDA-MB-468 cells (P<0.001, N=5), but not in MCF7
cells. In contrast, in unstimulated 231-WT cells, viability
was not further reduced by the combination of paclitaxel
and NHE inhibitors (not shown). Likewise, in 231-KO
cells, no significant differences were observed between
treatments; however, treatment with 1 nM paclitaxel alone
slightly but significantly reduced viability (P<0.05, N=5).

Knockout of NHE1 inhibits the growth of MDAMB-231-driven subcutaneous tumors in vivo in
athymic nude mice
To assess the tumor-promoting potential of MDAMB-231 cells in relation to NHE1 expression, tumor
growth of both 231-WT and 231-KO cells was examined
as xenografts in athymic nude mice over 60 days. As
shown in Fig. 3A, tumors derived from parental MDAMB-231 cells (N=8) increased in volume over time, while
the growth of 231-KO tumors was minimal, or not at all,
with small tumors formed in only 3 of 8 injection sites. At
28 days, the observed differences in tumor growth were
significant (P<0.05). At 35 days and onwards, growth of
231-WT tumors was markedly increased (P<0.001), but no
difference was observed in 231-KO tumor growth. While
heterogeneity of excised tumors was observed within
the 231-WT group, the importance of NHE1 in tumorpromotion was evident from the lack of tumor formation
with the 231-KO cells (Fig. 3B).

NHE1 inhibition enhances the effect of paclitaxel
on cell migration of triple-negative breast cancer
cells
We next examined the effect of NHE1 inhibition,
in combination with paclitaxel, on cell migration in the
three breast cancer cell lines. Stimulated (0.2% serum)
231-WT cells, migrated at a rate approximately 20%
faster than unstimulated (10% serum) cells at 18 hr. post-

NHE1 inhibition potentiates the effect of
paclitaxel on cell viability
As noted above, we found that stimulated 231-WT
cells have elevated Na+/H+ exchanger activity independent
of changes in protein expression. We hypothesized that
with NHE1 inhibition they would be more susceptible to
paclitaxel-induced cell death because of a dependence on
this elevated rate of Na+/H+ exchange. We indeed found
this to be the case. The viability of stimulated 231-WT
cells was significantly decreased (P<0.001, N=5) when
cells were treated with 1 nM paclitaxel in combination

scratch (P<0.001, N=10, Fig. 5A, B), whereas stimulated
MDA-MB-468 cells migrated at about 10% faster than
unstimulated cells (P<0.01, N=10). No differences were
observed in MCF7 migration between stimulated and
unstimulated cells. Interestingly, unstimulated 231KO cells migrated faster than stimulated cells (P<0.05,
N=10), a reversal of what is observed with the 231-WT.
There was no difference in the rate of migration between
unstimulated parental and NHE1-knockout MDA-MB-231
cells. Notably, when stimulated 231-WT or MDA-MB-468
cells were treated with paclitaxel in combination with
either NHE1 inhibitor EMD87580 or HMA, a marked
decrease in migration was observed (P<0.001, N=10, Fig.
5C, D). However, no such effect of drug treatments was
seen in stimulated 231-KO or MCF7 cells, or in any cell
type in unstimulated conditions (not shown).

various types of breast cancer cells. Cell invasion was
significantly reduced in 231-KO cells compared to 231WT parental cells cultured in either stimulated (0.2%
serum) or unstimulated (10% serum) conditions for 24
hr. prior to invasion. Additionally, stimulation of cells by
reduction of serum caused invasion to more than double in
231-WT cells, but had no effect on 231-KO cells (P<0.001,
N=4, Fig. 6A, B). A similar marked increase in invasive
potential was seen in another triple-negative breast cancer
cell line, MDA-MB-468 cells, with stimulation by reduced
serum. No detectable invasion was observed in MCF7
cells in this assay.
We also determined the effect of NHE1 inhibition
in combination with paclitaxel. When stimulated 231WT, 231-KO or MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with
paclitaxel in the presence or absence of NHE1 inhibitors,
EMD87580 or HMA, we found a significant reduction in
the number of invading 231-WT and MDA-MB-468 cells
after 24 hours (P<0.001, N=4, Fig. 6C, 6D), but no effect
on 231-KO cells.
Finally, we examined the role of NHE1 in a
study of 3-dimensional long-term invasion by breast
cancer cells. Cells were seeded onto a Matrigel matrixcoated scaffold that enabled 3-dimensional growth and

respectively. B, Excised tumors from all mice. 231-WT xenografted cells developed into significantly larger, heterogeneous tumors than the

the extracellular matrix in vivo. NHE1 knock out cells
(231-KO) cells did not survive in serum-deprived (0.2%
serum) conditions for 7 days in this assay, so the analysis
was limited to serum-supplemented conditions. Here, 231-

WT cells grown in 10% serum showed significantly more
invasion through and, greater proliferation within, the
scaffold than 231-KO cells (Fig. 7).

DISCUSSION
Both established and novel chemotherapeutic
strategies can have limited success in the treatment of
metastatic cancer, especially due to the development of
multidrug resistance [23]. This is particularly apparent
in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, which is
negative for the expression of estrogen and progesterone
receptors and HER2, and therefore not susceptible to
hormone or HER2-targeted therapy. Experimentation
has shown that enhanced NHE1 activity acidifies the
extracellular pH, and promotes metastasis of highly
invasive types of breast cancer cells [24-27]. The
phenomenon of NHE1 activation and acidification
promoting tumorigenesis and invasiveness is not specific
to breast cancer and also occurs in various forms in
malignant melanoma [28], in fibrosarcoma cells [29],
and in human colon cancer cells [29]. It stands to reason,
therefore, that manipulating the tumor microenvironment
through the modulation of NHE1 activity could augment
chemotherapy strategies and potentially lessen the
incidence of multidrug resistance. This approach might
prove useful wherever multidrug resistance occurs, in both
triple negative and non-triple negative breast cancers.
In the present study, we therefore investigated the
role of NHE1 in breast cancer cell invasion, migration
and in tumor formation. Additionally, we studied the role
of NHE1 in susceptibility to paclitaxel, one of the most
effective chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of
this disease. These studies represent the first work that
utilizes a complete, stable, and functional knockout of
NHE1 in metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
Unlike transient silencing of NHE1 with targeted siRNA
or partial knockdown of NHE1 with targeted shRNA, we
constructed a complete functional knockout of NHE1
in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using zinc finger
nucleases, thus enabling both in vivo and in vitro analysis
of the physiological role of the Na+/H+ exchanger.
We characterized the role of NHE1 in culture
conditions either supplemented with serum or serum
deprived. Serum deprivation occurs in vivo in the tumor
microenvironment and tumor cells respond differently
than normal cells to low-serum culture conditions. For
example, NHE1 becomes constitutively active when
serum is depleted [30, 31]. We found that the relative
Na+/H+ exchange activity in stimulated 231-WT cells
was markedly higher compared to unstimulated cells,
where a basal NHE1 activity was observed. We further
demonstrated that this elevated NHE1 activity in
stimulated cells was not due to an increased expression
of the NHE1 protein. Instead, it must have been due
to changes in the regulation of NHE1 consistent with

Figure 4: Effect of paclitaxel in combination with
NHE1 inhibitors on cell viability of wild type (231-WT)
and NHE1-knockout (231-KO) MDA-MB-231 cells,
and MDA-MB-468 (468) and MCF7 cells. Cells were

treated for 24 hours in reduced (0.2%) serum media (stimulated
conditions), with 1 nM paclitaxel (TAX), 10 μM EMD87580
(EMD) (A), or 10 nM HMA (HMA) (B), or with both paclitaxel
and EMD87580 (ET, A), or paclitaxel and HMA (HT, B)
[*P<0.001, +P<0.01, N=5]. Media only control cells (CTRL)
were left untreated. Viability was assessed by the catalytic
conversion of yellow MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to purple formazan in live cells.

was recorded as the optical density of the sample at 570 nm,
with background subtraction at 630 nm. All data are presented
as a ratio of sample means over mean control values for each
treatment for each cell type. In 231-KO cells, a significant loss of
viability is observed when cells are treated with paclitaxel alone
[+P<0.01, N=5]. In stimulated conditions, both triple-negative
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells showed significantly
reduced viability when treated with paclitaxel in the presence of
NHE1 inhibitors EMD87580 or HMA [*P<0.001, N=5]. MCF7
cell viability, however, was unaffected by drug treatments.

earlier observations [32]. Serum deprivation reduces
lactate production in both non-tumorigenic (MCF10A)
and tumorigenic (MCF7) breast epithelial cell lines, but
while it inhibits NHE1 activity in the non-tumorigenic
cells, depletion of serum stimulates exchanger activity
in tumor cells. This was earlier reported to be dependent
on phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), though it was not

known if PI3K phosphorylates NHE1 directly or through
some unknown intermediary [30]. Later observations
indicated that serum deprivation activates NHE1 in breast
cancer cells via a sequential RhoA/p160ROCK/p38MAPK
signaling pathway, gated by direct protein kinase A
phosphorylation and concurrent inhibition of RhoA [33].
Elevated activity of NHE1 in tumor cells can affect

intracellular ion concentrations. In vivo, the activity of Na+
transporters would result in cellular alkalinization that is
typical of tumor cells [34]. This results in a concomitant
increase in sodium loading. In cardiomyocytes [35], and
malignant gliomas [36], this increased NHE1 activity and
elevated intracellular Na+ causes elevated intracellular Ca2+
through reversed activity of the Na+/Ca+2 exchanger [37].
How important this pathway is in tumor cells is unclear at
this time, however, it is known that two important protein
regulators of NHE1, calmodulin and CHP (calcineurin
regulatory protein) are calcium dependent in their
association. One isoform of CHP, CHP2 is upregulated in
tumor cells and the CHP2-NHE1 interaction is suggested
to be key in maintenance of the cellular alkalinization
associated with malignantly transformed cells [38].
Further studies are ongoing to characterize the complex
regulation of NHE1 in breast cancer cells.
When we examined the role of NHE1 in triplenegative breast cancer cells overall, our results showed
that NHE1 has a facilitative role in breast cancer invasion
and metastasis, as well as a chemo-protective role in
highly invasive triple-negative breast cancer cells. These
metastasis-enhancing roles were not apparent in less
invasive, non-triple-negative, breast cancer cells. The
evidence for this statement comes from experiments both
in vivo and in vitro, and from experiments in which we
knocked out the NHE1 protein or inhibited its activity.
In summary, the experiments suggesting that NHE1
facilitates metastatic breast cancer are: 1, knockout of
NHE1 reduced the in vivo tumor-promoting capability of
MDA-MB-231 cells; 2, NHE1 deletion in MDA-MB-231
cells reduced their invasive capacity; and 3, specific
inhibition of NHE1 potentiated the effect of paclitaxel,
reducing cell viability, invasion and migration. These are
discussed below.
1, NHE1-Knockout: Knocking out NHE1 from the
highly tumorigenic MDA-MB-231 cells significantly
reduces their tumor-promoting capability in vivo. This
was demonstrated by the differences in subcutaneous
growth of tumor xenografts of parental and knockout cells
in athymic nude mice. Interestingly, despite comparable
rates of proliferation between the parental and NHE1knockout cells in vitro, little or no tumor development was
apparent in xenografts of 231-KO cells. These results are
the first such demonstration of the critical role of NHE1 in
tumor development of triple-negative breast cancer cells
in vivo. In this study, we also demonstrated that in an in
vitro invasion assay, NHE1-knockout cells were unable to
survive serum-depleted conditions over seven days. This
might account for their inability to promote tumor growth
in vivo.
2, Loss of NHE1 reduces cell migration and
invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells: Knockout
of NHE1 from MDA-MB-231 cells dramatically
decreased the migratory capacity of these cells, an effect
that is independent of their rates of proliferation over 18
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hours. In addition, the invasive potential of these normally
aggressively invasive breast cancer cells was markedly
reduced with the deletion of NHE1. Even in the presence
of serum, NHE1-knockout cells were significantly less
invasive through an extracellular matrix than parental
cells, particularly over several days, as shown by the
3-dimensional invasion assay data. This confirms that
NHE1 is critical to the molecular mechanisms involved in
invasion. Notably, while the viability of stimulated 231WT cells was unaffected by increasing doses of paclitaxel,
deletion of NHE1 in the knockout cells (231-KO) made
them more susceptible to paclitaxel-mediated cell death (at
doses upwards of 0.1 nM), suggesting a chemo-protective
role for NHE1 in MDA-MB-231 cells.
3, Specific inhibition of NHE1 potentiates effects
of paclitaxel: We found that two structurally different
NHE1 inhibitors, EMD87580 [(2-methyl-4,5-di(methylsulfonyl)-benzoyl)-guanidine], and HMA [5-(N,
N-hexamethylene)-amiloride] specifically potentiated
effects of paclitaxel on triple-negative breast cancer cells.
This included effects on cell migration, viability and
invasion when the combinatorial treatment of paclitaxel
in the presence of NHE1 inhibitors was applied to MDAMB-231 cells. Here, we found that paclitaxel alone
caused a slight but significant decrease in the migration
of stimulated triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 breast cancer cells. However, when paclitaxel
was used in the presence of NHE1 inhibitors, its effect
was greatly enhanced. Likewise, paclitaxel, EMD87580,
and HMA alone, all had an effect on the invasiveness of
these cells when stimulated, however, when paclitaxel was
used in combination with an NHE1 inhibitor, the reduction
in the rate of invasion was much more pronounced. These
effects did not occur in non-triple-negative MCF7 breast
cancer cells.
Our results are a novel finding with human
breast cancer cells. While one study has shown that the
amiloride analogue DMA, (5-(N,N-dimethyl) amiloridehydrochloride) potentiates paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis
[39], it is now known that MDA-MB-435 are in fact a
melanoma cell line [40]. Nevertheless, those results
support the idea that NHE1 inhibition can enhance the
effects of paclitaxel on cancer cells. The concept of
inhibiting NHE1 activity as a potential strategy to augment
existing chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor cells, and
in the management of tumor size, is intriguing. Our
experimental design used NHE1 inhibition with paclitaxel
treatment at doses much lower than the established IC50
of 2.4 nM for paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 cells [41].
The beneficial effects did not occur in unstimulated cells,
where the rate of NHE1 exchanger activity is minimal.
It therefore appears that this combinatorial treatment
effect may be contingent upon NHE1 hyper-activation,
as occurs when cells are serum-deprived in the tumor
microenvironment. Remarkably, these effects were also
observed in the moderately invasive, triple-negative,
1270

Oncotarget

basal-like MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, albeit to
a lesser extent. In contrast, we did not observe a similar
trend with the lowly invasive, hormone receptor-positive,
luminal MCF7 cells, at least with the drug concentrations
used in the present study. These data suggest that the
observed effects may be specific to triple-negative breast
cancers which have a constitutively activated NHE1
protein in the disease state [32].
The potential of NHE1 as a target in the development
of novel anti-cancer therapeutics was recently reviewed,
highlighting key characteristics of NHE1 that could
be exploited to combat the tumorigenic and metastatic
capacity of cancer cells [42]. The NHE1 gene, SLC9A1
is a redox regulated gene. Down-regulation of NHE1
expression decreases the capacity of cells to recover
from an acute acid load and sensitizes them to cell death
triggers [43]. One approach to down-regulation of NHE1
may be through PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor). A peroxisome proliferator response element was
identified in the promoter region of the NHE1. Expression
of PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ)
is increased in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast
tumors, and correlates with an acidic intracellular pH and
it was suggested that judicious use of PPARγ ligands at
low doses could have significant anti-cancer effects in
combination with chemotherapy [44]. Whether or not
the anti-cancer effects of down-regulation of NHE1 gene
expression are comparable to the chemical inhibition of
NHE1 activity, has yet to be explored in depth.
In this study, we suggest that NHE1 inhbition
may reduce the acidic extracellular pH of the tumor
microenvironment, thereby rendering paclitaxel more
effective. Could inhibition of NHE1 in vivo also
improve the efficacy of paclitaxel treatment? This idea
is supported by evidence suggesting that another NHE1
inhibitor, amiloride-HCl, though it has low NHE1
specificity, still might have anti-cancer properties [14].
Certainly, NHE1 inhibitors have been used in clinical
trials involving heart disease, however, there are still
challenges left before their use is approved [45]. Possibly,
the development of more selective NHE1 inhibitors, or
inhibitors that specifically target tumor cells, might be
productive in the treatment of breast cancer. The more
potent of new highly selective NHE1 inhibitors includes:
cariporide,
(N-(Diaminomethylene)-4-isopropyl-3(methylsulfonyl)benzamide); the phenoxazine derivative
Phx-3 (2-aminophenoxazine-3-one); and Compound 9t
(5-aryl-4-(4-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)piperididn-1yl)pyrimidine analog). The efficacies and specificity for
NHE1 inhibition of these compounds and their potential
for use in future clinical and/or pre-clinical trials should
be considered for the treatment of triple-negative breast
cancer, as well as for BRCA1-positive breast cancer.
Indeed, the use of selective NHE1 inhibitors can be
applied to the treatment of other human malignant tumors
in attempts to not only prevent tumor formation, but also
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

circumvent multidrug resistance [16, 27].
Since pH regulation plays an integral role in
the tumor microenvironment, it is highly plausible to
consider the modulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity
as a means of increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy,
particularly for triple-negative breast cancer, for which
targeted therapies do not currently exist. Realistically,
this synergistic approach using NHE1 inhibitors as coadjuvants to established chemotherapeutic drugs, could
arguably be effective in augmenting the targeted treatment
of the HER2-positive subtype of breast cancer as well.
Future experiments could address this in multiple breast
cancer subtypes. Moreover, modulating the pH of the
tumor microenvironment could conceivably decrease the
incidence and spread of multidrug resistance for anticancer agents in general. Overall, our data highlight a
novel putative, clinical role for NHE1 inhibitors targeted
to modulate pH in the tumor microenvironment and to
maximize the efficacy of breast cancer chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
Parental MDA-MB-231 (231-WT), 231-KO (NHE1knockout), MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 cells were cultured
in high-glucose modified DMEM (HyClone) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 10 mM HEPES,
and 1000 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) under
standard culture conditions (5% CO2, 37°C and high
humidity). Starvation media was supplemented with 0.2%
serum but otherwise identical in composition. Paclitaxel
(Taxol®, Sigma) and NHE1 inhibitors, EMD87580
[2-methyl-4,5-di-(methylsulfonyl)-benzoylguanidine,
gift from Merck] and HMA [5-(N, N-hexamethylene)amiloride, Sigma], were used at indicated concentrations.
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 cell lines were
authenticated by DNA analysis (DDC Medical, Ohio) and
showed >95% homology to the ATCC STR profile.

Generation of 231-KO (NHE1-knockout) cells
In MDA-MB-231 cells, endogenous NHE1
was excised using CompoZr® Knockout Zinc Finger
Nucleases (Sigma-Aldrich) specifically designed to target
the human NHE1 gene SLC9A1, and according to the
manufacturers’ protocols. Potential knockout cells were
screened by western blot using anti-NHE1 antibody (BD
Transduction Laboratories) and re-selected using the
proton suicide assay as described earlier [46]. Briefly, cells
are incubated in a Na+-free lithium chloride (LiCl) buffer
for two hours to allow for NHE1-mediated uptake of Li+
in the absence of Na+, which results in acidification of the
extracellular pH. LiCl buffer is then replaced with choline
1271

chloride buffer for one hour. NHE1 is unable to transport
choline, resulting in the reversal of proton exchange across
the plasma membrane and acidification of intracellular pH.
Intracellular proton accumulation becomes lethal in cells
with a functional exchanger whereas NHE1-knockout
cells survive, thereby ensuring the purity of the 231-KO
cell line.

or not (unstimulated) for 24 hr. prior to loading with
BCECF-AM for 20 minutes at 37°C. BCECF-AM is a
cell permeable, non-fluorescent dye that is de-esterified
to BCECF upon entry into cells. In cellulo, BCECF
fluoresces in response to changes in intracellular pH. After
incubation with BCECF, followed by incubation in a Na+containing equilibration buffer for 3 min, an acute acid
load is induced by treating cells with ammonium chloride
(50 mM × 3 min). After removal of NH4Cl, followed by
reperfusion with Na+-free and Na+-containing buffers,
cells are placed in Na+-free calibration buffer containing
nigericin and high K+ to calibrate signal ratios at pH 6,
7 and 8. The rate of recovery of pHi as indicated by the
ratio of BCECF fluorescence post-excitation at 440 nm
and 502 nm, and emission at 528 nm, was recorded using
a PTI Deltascan Illumination System (Photon Technology
International, New Jersey, USA). NHE1 activity was
calculated from the slope of the first 20 sec of recovery
from acidification and was expressed as ∆pH/sec.
Background drift in the absence of Na+ was subtracted
from rates of recovery in the presence of Na+, and all
data were normalized to controls to show relative Na+/H+
exchange activity between cell types. Buffering capacity
was calculated and shown to be similar across all cell
types.

Xenograft tumor growth experiments
All animal experiments/husbandry were approved
and follow the guidelines of the Canadian Animal Care
and Use Committee. Subcutaneous injection of tumor
cells was carried out as previously described [47].
Parental MDA-MB-231 and NHE1-knockout (231KO) cells were grown to confluence in 100 mm2 culture
dishes, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
trypsinized, and resuspended in complete media. After
centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, cells were washed
once in PBS and resuspended in a 4:1 mixture of serumfree media:Matrigel (BD #354234, 10 mg/ml of LDEVfree matrix). Two hundred microliter (containing ~ 2.5 X
106 cells) of cells:Matrigel suspension was subcutaneously
injected into the right and left dorsal flanks of female
athymic nude mice (Taconic Laboratories; #NCRNU-F,
CrTac:NCr-FoxN1Nu) to determine the tumor-promoting
potential of the 231-WT and 231-KO breast cancer cells.
Mice were monitored weekly to assess tumor growth and
euthanized at Day 60. Tumor volume was calculated based
on the volume of a sphere (V = [4/3)πr3] or the length
and width of the tumor mass (V = 0.5x X 2y, where x is
the length and y is the width of the tumor mass) wherever
appropriate.

Cytotoxicity, Viability and Proliferation assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1
x 105 cells/well, and left untreated (control) or treated with
paclitaxel and/or NHE1 inhibitors EMD87580 or HMA in
phenol red-free high-glucose modified DMEM (HyClone)
media supplemented with either 10% (unstimulated cells)
or 0.2% (stimulated cells) fetal calf serum and incubated
for 0 to 48 hr. under standard culture conditions. Unless
otherwise noted, drug concentrations were used as follows:
paclitaxel (1 nM), EMD (10 μM) and HMA (10 nM). MTT
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide, Sigma] assays with a final MTT concentration
of 0.5 mg/ml were used to assess cytotoxicity to drugs,
resultant cell viability (at 24 hr.) and proliferation (at 0, 24,
48 hr.). Absorbance was measured with a BioTek Synergy
MX microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc.) at 570
nm and background (at a reference wavelength of 630
nm) was subtracted. All viability data were normalized to
untreated controls. Proliferation data was represented as
a measure of the increase in the rate of cell proliferation
from time 0 hr.

Western blotting
Total protein from whole cell lysates was separated
by 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated overnight
with anti-NHE1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories)
and anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was
used as a loading control. Image J software was used to
quantify NHE1 expression.

cells, supplemented with media, and either left untreated
(control), or treated with paclitaxel and/or NHE1 inhibitors
with either 10% (unstimulated cells) or 0.2% (stimulated

acquired at 0, 18 and 24 hr. time-points. Arbitrary
measurements of gap closure were quantified with Image
Pro Plus software using a Leica DM IRB microscope (at
10X magnification). A minimum of three images/well and
five measurements/image was acquired for each treatment;
all treatments were done in triplicate. Data shown are
a representation of decrease in gap distance at 18 hr.

Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as means ± SEM and plotted
with KaleidaGraph 4.1 (Synergy Software, PA, US). Data
shown are a mean of N=3 to 10 independent experiments.
Statistical analysis was carried out using the two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare data between
groups with GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, CA,
US). Post hoc comparisons were made using Bonferroni’s
multiple-comparison tests. A P value less than 0.05 was
considered to be signiﬁcant.

Invasion assays

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Cell invasion assays were performed using
Boyden chamber 8 μm porous inserts (Corning) coated
with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, cells were
either serum-starved (stimulated) or not (unstimulated)
and/or treated with appropriate drugs for 24 hr. prior to
adding 1 × 105 cells per insert. Reservoir media contained
10% serum to promote chemotaxis. After 24 hr., cells
on the upper surface of the insert were removed with a
cotton swab and invading cells on the lower surface
were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in
100% methanol, and stained with Giemsa. Invasion was a
measure of how many cells traversed the membrane, and
was imaged at 10X magnification with Image Pro Plus
software using a Leica DM IRB microscope. Data shown
are a representation of 3 to 5 fields/insert over multiple
independent experiments. 3D invasion assays were carried
out with 6-well Alvetex® scaffold inserts (Reinnervate,
UK), which were coated with Matrigel according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, inserts were pretreated with 70% ethanol to prime scaffolds for cell
culture. After washing in PBS, scaffolds were coated with
0.8 mg/ml of Matrigel prior to adding cells. Cells were
seeded at a density of 1 x 106 cells in 100 μL of media
per insert and allowed to attach to the scaffold surface for
90 minutes prior to adding media. Serum supplemented
media (10%) was added for the first 24 hr. to facilitate
initial cell adhesion. After 24 hr., media was changed and
cells were either serum-starved (stimulated, 0.2% serum)
or not (unstimulated, 10% serum). Cells were allowed
to invade through the scaffold over 7 days with media
changes every 2 days. Scaffold discs were then excised
from the insert, embedded in paraffin, and longitudinally
sectioned into multiple 10 μm sections prior to staining
with hematoxylin and eosin. Invasion was a measure of
how many cells traversed the scaffold, and was imaged
at 20X magnification with a Zeiss ApoTome Microscope
and Zeiss AxioCam MRm imaging software. Data shown
are a representation of triplicate sections per slide with
