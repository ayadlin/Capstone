ABSTRACT
Myxofibrosarcomas are genetically complex and involve recurrently deleted
chromosome 9p, for which we characterized the pathogenically relevant target(s)
using genomic profiling. In 12 of the 15 samples, we detected complete or partial
losses of 9p. The only aggressiveness-associated, differentially lost region was
9p21.3, spanning the potential inactivated methylthioadenosine phosphorylase
(MTAP) that exhibited homozygous (4/15) or hemizygous (3/15) deletions. In
independent samples, MTAP gene status was assessed using quantitative- and
methylation-specific PCR assays, and immunoexpression was evaluated. We applied
MTAP reexpression or knockdown to elucidate the functional roles of MTAP and
the therapeutic potential of L-alanosine in MTAP-preserved and MTAP-deficient
myxofibrosarcoma cell lines and xenografts. MTAP protein deficiency (37%) was
associated with MTAP gene inactivation (P < 0.001) by homozygous deletion or
promoter methylation, and independently portended unfavorable metastasis-free
survival (P = 0.0318) and disease-specific survival (P = 0.014). Among the MTAPdeficient cases, the homozygous deletion of MTAP predicted adverse outcome.
In MTAP-deficient cells, MTAP reexpression inhibited cell migration and invasion,

D1. This approach also attenuated the tube-forming abilities of human umbilical
venous endothelial cells, attributable to the transcriptional repression of MMP-9, and
abrogated the susceptibility to L-alanosine. The inhibiting effects of MTAP expression
on tumor growth, angiogenesis, and the induction of apoptosis by L-alanosine were
validated using MTAP-reexpressing xenografts and reverted using RNA interference
in MTAP-preserved cells. In conclusion, homozygous deletion primarily accounts
for the adverse prognostic impact of MTAP deficiency and confers the biological
aggressiveness and susceptibility to L-alanosine in myxofibrosarcomas.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Myxofibrosarcoma is characterized by the
multinodular growth of spindle to polygonal sarcoma cells
within variably myxoid stroma containing long curvilinear
vessels [1, 2]. Clinically, increased tumor grades and
stages are frequently observed in myxofibrosarcomas
after local recurrence, and may cause metastatic diseases
[1–4]. However, histological evaluation is insufficiently
satisfactory to predict aggressiveness of individual cases,
indicating the need to elucidate the pathogenesis of
myxofibrosarcoma [2, 3].
Genetically, complex karyotypic changes are
characteristic of myxofibrosarcomas [4, 5] and a recent
large-scale genomic study indicated that a nonrandom
loss of chromosome 9, and particularly 9p, occurs in
myxofibrosarcomas [5]. By using ultrahigh-resolution
array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we
previously profiled the global copy-number alterations
(CNAs) in myxofibrosarcoma specimens and cell lines
and characterized SKP2 on 5p and CDK6 and MET on
7q as amplified oncogenes of pathogenic relevance
[6–8]. Regarding DNA losses, chromosome 9p
was the most frequently lost chromosomal arm in
myxofibrosarcomas [5], prompting the search for
potential tumor suppressor gene(s) underlying this
selection pressure for the loss of 9p. We characterized
methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) on 9p21.3
because whether the tumor-suppressive role of this
polyamine metabolism-regulating enzyme is independent
from the frequently co-deleted CDKN2A and CDKN2B
genes still remains debated [9–12].
In this study, MTAP protein deficiency in
myxofibrosarcomas was associated with a poor
prognosis and inactivated MTAP gene, caused by
either homozygous deletion or promoter methylation.
Functionally, MTAP deficiency yielded increased
aggression in myxofibrosarcoma cells. By restricting
the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) supply [13, 14],
L-alanosine induced prominent apoptosis in the MTAPdeficient myxofibrosarcoma cells and derived xenografts.
Collectively, the mechanistic and clinical evidence
reinforces MTAP as a functional tumor suppressor
gene exhibiting prognostic and therapeutic relevance in
myxofibrosarcomas.

Genomic profiling revealed recurrent 9p loss

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Chromosomal imbalances of varying degrees were
detected in all samples subjected to aCGH profiling,
indicating more recurrent deletions than gains, and
exhibiting characteristically high genomic complexity.
According to filter criteria, Nexus software revealed
recurrent DNA gains in 211 chromosomal regions
spanning 4577 genes in all of the genomes. However, 235
chromosomal regions were nonrandomly lost, involving
7871 named genes. In the long arm of chromosome 9,
the copy number alterations were predominantly of DNA
gains, except for the 9q34 region that exhibited DNA
losses. In contrast, the complete or partial losses of 9p
were detected in 12 of the 15 samples, and five major
deletion cores on 9p, recurrent in ≥ 20% of samples tested,
were interspersed with short stretches of DNA gains
(Figures 1A, B, Supplementary Table S1). Within the
9p22.2-p21.1 deletion core, the sole differentially deleted,
aggressiveness-associated region on 9p was narrowed
down to 9p21.3 (P = 0.0454). This result indicated
the implication of 9p21.3 in the myxofibrosarcoma
progression, in which MTAP and CDKN2A/CDKN2B
were homozygously deleted in 4 and 4 samples and
hemizygously deleted in 3 and 3 samples, respectively
(Table S2).

Associations of MTAP immunoexpression with
clinicopathological and gene statuses in primary
myxofibrosarcomas
The MTAP immunostain of 87 independent
primary myxofibrosarcomas (Figure 1C) demonstrated
an aberrant MTAP deficiency in 32 cases (37%). MTAP
gene dosage was successfully determined in 79 cases,
20 of which (25.3%) exhibited homozygous deletion
at an MTAP/PFKL ratio of < 0.2 (Table 1, Figure 1C).
Because 13 of the 29 MTAP protein-deficient tumors were
not homozygously deleted at the MTAP gene (Table 1),
methylation-specific PCR was adopted to examine whether
promoter hypermethylation alternatively caused protein
loss, and 10 of these 13 cases were hypermethylated
at the MTAP promoter (Table 1, Figure S1A).

homozygous deletion of the MTAP gene. Intratumoral nonneoplastic cells in MFS96b account for the less prominent loss of MTAP copies.

MTAP protein deficiency was strongly related to
inactivated MTAP genes (P < 0.001, Table 1), either by
homozygous deletion or promoter methylation. Regarding
the status of MTAP protein expression and promoter
methylation, no significant difference was detected in the
clincopathological features, including the tumor grading
and staging. By contrast, MTAP homozygous deletion
was significantly correlated with high histological grades
(P = 0.006, Figure 1C, Table 1) and a high mitotic rate
(P = 0.011, Figure S1B), and marginally correlated with
advanced clinical stages (P = 0.097).

aggressively and exhibited significantly shorter DSS
(P = 0.0129, Figure 2C) and MFS (P = 0.0150, Figure 2D)
values than did the cases lacking homozygous
deletion. Among the nonhomozygously deleted cases,
no difference in prognosis was observed between the
MTAP-expressing and MTAP-hypermethylated cases.
Compared with the homozygously deleted cases,
the MTAP-deficient tumors caused by methylation
exhibited a trend toward more favorable outcomes
(P = 0.0735, Figure 2C; P = 0.0881, Figure 2D). These
results suggested variable implications of distinct
inactivating mechanisms in MTAP-deficient tumors.
In the multivariate analysis (Table S4), MTAP protein
deficiency was the single independent prognosticator
of an inferior DSS (P = 0.0140, hazard ratio = 4.020)
and, along with high histological grades, could predict
inferior MFS (P = 0.0318, hazard ratio = 2.527).

Survival analyses
Univariate correlations of the clinical outcome
with various clinicopathological, immunohistochemical,
and molecular parameters are shown in Table S3 and
Figure 2. MTAP protein deficiency was a significant
adverse prognosticator of an adverse DSS (P = 0.0195,
Figure 2A) and was marginally predictive of a short
MFS (P = 0.0572, Figure 2B). Regarding various
mechanisms regulating MTAP expression, MTAPhomozygously deleted myxofibrosarcomas behaved

a bystander event concomitant with deletions of
CDKN2A/B [13, 14]. Until recently, scholars have
started noticing the tumor-suppressive attributes of
MTAP that may independently inhibit carcinogenesis
[9, 11]. We first characterized myxofibrosarcoma cell
lines regarding their MTAP gene status and endogenous
protein expression. Consistent with the aCGH findings,
homozygous deletion in OH931 and NMFH-2 cells was
confirmed using real-time PCR quantification without
a detectable MTAP DNA copy (Figures 3A, S2A),
reflective of the absence of MTAP protein expression.

Endogenously expressing MTAP, the NMFH-1 cells
were neither homozygously deleted at the MTAP gene
nor methylated at its promoter (Figure 3A, S1A).
Therefore, we applied MATP-bearing vectors and
shMTAP to decipher how inactivated MTAP modulates
myxofibrosarcoma phenotypes regarding various cancer
hallmarks. The stably transfected and knockdown clones
were validated using western blots (Figure 3B). In the
NMFH-1 cells, the silencing of the MTAP transcript with
2 stable clones of shMTAP was determined using realtime quantitation (Figure S2B).

Myxofibrosarcomas involving homozygously deleted MTAP genes yield significantly poor outcomes for both survival endpoints
(C, D) and MTAP-expressing and MTAP-methylated cases did not differ prognostically.

MTAP expression inhibited cell proliferation and
colony formation of myxofibrosarcoma primarily
through the downregulation of cyclin D1
To elucidate the potential MTAP-associated
antitumor function, we compared the BrdU readout of
myxofibrosarcoma cells engineered to manifest various
MTAP expression levels. In the MTAP-reexpressing
NMFH-2 myxofibrosarcoma transfectants, the readout
indicative of cell proliferation significantly reduced,
whereas shMTAP effectively promoted cell proliferation
in the NMFH-1 cells exhibiting endogenous MTAP
(Figure 3C). By using an ECIS assay, we measured
NMFH-2 cells for real-time cell proliferation,
revealing a significantly slow cell growth rate in
MTAP-reexpressing transfectants (Figure S2C). These
observations supported that MTAP may dampen
the proliferation of myxofibrosarcoma, prompting
investigating whether MTAP expression modulates

cell cycle regulators and inhibits colony formation. We
performed western blotting to evaluate alterations in the
G1- and G1/S-associated cyclins and cyclin-dependent
kinases. Among these, only cyclin D1 expression was
consistently downregulated in both MTAP-reexpressing
NMFH-2 cells and shLac-transfected NMFH-1 cells
(Figure 3C). However, the trend in alterations in cyclin
E and CDK2 expression varied between exogenous
expression and RNA interference approaches as well
as between 2 shMTAP clones. In the flow cytometric
analysis, MTAP-reexpressing NMFH-2 cells exhibited
significant cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and
concomitant low percentages of cells in the S and G2
phases (Figure S2D). In a soft-agar assay, significantly
small and few cell colonies were observed in MTAPreexpressing NMFH-2 transfectants, substantiating
the inhibition of MTAP in anchorage-independent
growth (Figure 3D). These findings imply that cyclin

CCD966SK fibroblasts, the OH931 and NMFH-2 cell lines were homozygously deleted at the MTAP gene; no DNA copy was detected
using real-time PCR (left) and the western blots exhibited no MTAP expression (right). Although the MTAP gene dosage was slightly
decreased, a western blotting assay revealed MTAP-expressing NMFH-1 cells. (B) Stable exogenous MTAP reexpression was achieved
in the OH931 (left) and NMFH-2 (middle) myxofibrosarcoma cell lines, and the western blots exhibited the expected bands using antiMTAP. Two clones of shMTAP stably downregulated MTAP expression in NMFH-1 cells exhibiting decreased protein abundance (right),
compared with the non-targeting shLacZ controls. (C) The BrdU readout, indicating the level of proliferative activity, was significantly
reduced in stable MTAP-transfected NMFH-2 cells (left), but increased in MTAP-silenced NMFH-1 cells (right), compared with the
corresponding controls. Depending on the MTAP expression status, only the expression level of cyclin D1 in western blots was consistently
altered as expected among the MTAP-reexpressing NMFH-2 cells and 2 MTAP-knockdown clones of the NMFH-1 cells. (D) Compared
with the empty controls (left), the MTAP-reexpressing NMFH-2 transfectants (middle) formed fewer colonies on soft agar, as expressed in
the histogram (bottom).

MTAP expression conferred antiangiogenic function

D1 represents the predominant cell cycle regulator
associated with the antiproliferative role of MTAP.

Recently, we reported that aberrant loss of
argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) caused by promoter
methylation may contribute to the enhanced angiogenesis
in myxofibrosarcomas [15]. Because MTAP is linked
to polyamine metabolism and adenine and methionine
salvage [16, 17], examining whether MTAP inactivation
promotes angiogenesis by perturbing the metabolic
balance of sarcoma cells is conceivable, similar to
the scenario involved in deregulated ASS1. Under
various experimental conditions used to manipulate
MTAP expression, 3 myxofibrosarcoma cell lines were

The results of wound-healing assays indicated
significantly rapid wound closure in both NMFH-2 cells

silenced against endogenous MTAP (Figure S3A,C).
According to matrigel invasion assays, the 2 conditions
also yielded significantly increased invading tumor cells
(Figure S3B), indicating enhanced metastatic propensity

assessed for the formation of HUVEC tubes incubated
with corresponding conditioned media. Using HUVEC
assays, the angiogenic capability significantly decreased
to 55% and 60% in the MTAP-reexpressing OH931 and
NMFH-2 transfectants, respectively, but significantly
increased up to 2~3-fold in the MTAP-silenced NMFH-1
cells (Figure 4A). Because of increased angiogenesis
in the MTAP-deficient state, we used an RT-PCR
expression array to explore the potential mediators
relevant to MTAP-regulated angiogenesis. Lacking
upregulated genes in this angiogenesis-associated panel,
MTAP-reexpressing NMFH-2 cells showed significantly
reduced mRNA expression of 6 candidates (Table S5).
Of these, CXCL-9, CXCL-10, and MMP-9 proteins
were concomitantly downregulated using western blots

in both NMFH-2 and OH931 MTAP-reexpressing cell
lines, the conditioned media of which also consistently
demonstrated decreased MMP-9 protein concentration
using ELISA (Figure 4B). Real-time RT-PCR showed
decreased expression of MMP-9 mRNA in both MTAPreexpressing myxofibrosarcoma cell lines (Figure 4C).
In the MTAP-silenced NMFH-1 cells used for
cross-validation, MMP-9 was the only molecule that
exhibited upregulated mRNA and protein expression
(Figure 4B, C). The luciferase activity of
MMP-9 promoter significantly reduced in the
MTAP-reexpressing OH931 and NMFH-2 cells
(Figure 4D). These data demonstrated that MTAP
deficiency enhanced the transcriptional upregulation of
MMP-9 to promote angiogenesis in myxofibrosarcomas.

Figure 4: MTAP governs tumor angiogenesis by the transcriptional repression of MMP-9. (A) The well-formed HUVEC

tubes decrease when exposed to conditioned media from MTAP-reexpressing transfectants of NMFH-2 and OH931 cells. Conversely,
MTAP knockdown promoted angiogenesis in both shMTAP-transduced clones of the NMFH-1 cells (left). The relative level of angiogenic
tube-forming activity is expressed in the histograms (right). (B) Of the differentially expressed genes identified from the RT-PCR expression
array, western blotting validation for both MTAP-reexpressing transfectants exhibited correspondingly decreased protein expression of
CXCL-9, CXCL-10, and MMP-9 (left). The MMP-9 protein concentration secreted into the conditioned media was significantly reduced in
MTAP-reexpressing NMFH-2 and OH931 cell lines (middle). Only the level of MMP-9 protein expression was significantly upregulated in
the cross-validation of MTAP-silenced NMFH-1 cells (right). (C) As a representative potential downstream mediator of MTAP, the MMP-9
mRNA expression levels were significantly downregulated in the MTAP-reexpressing NMFH-2 and OH931 cells (left) but elevated by
MTAP knockdown using quantitative RT-PCR (right). (D) Luciferase activity of MMP-9 promoter construct was significantly lower in the
NMFH-2 and OH931 cells transfected with the MTAP-expressing vector than in the empty controls. All experiments were performed in

susceptibility of myxofibrosarcoma cells to L-alanosine
(Figure 5B). This approach significantly reverted
the attenuated cell viability caused by L-alanosine,
indicating that its antitumor selectivity was attributable
to the MTAP deficiency in myxofibrosarcoma cells.
We evaluated the in vivo efficacy of L-alanosine
in NMFH-2 xenografts (Figure 5C). From Day 25
posttreatment until Day 42 at sacrifice, significantly
smaller tumor volumes were observed in both
groups treated with L-alanosine at 25 μM or 50 μM,
compared with the PBS controls. However, no dosedependent therapeutic effect was observed. The
control xenografts exhibited high-grade pleomorphic
histology characterized by frequent atypical mitoses,
whereas the L-alanosine-treated specimens exhibited
quiescent or apoptotic-appearing cells in a fibromyxoid
backdrop containing increased hyaline collagenous
fibers. In the L-alanosine-treated xenografts,
significantly increased TUNEL-labeled apoptotic cells
were observed (P  <  0.001), substantiating the in vivo
apoptosis-inducing effect of L-alanosine.

The in vivo inhibitory effect of MTAP on tumor
growth was analyzed in NMFH-2 xenografts exhibiting
ectopic MTAP reexpression versus empty controls
(Figure 5A). The xenografts reexpressing MTAP
exhibited a significantly small average tumor volume
from Day 7 until sacrifice on Day 30, on which the
excised specimens were evidently larger and heavier in
the controls than were those in the MTAP-reexpressing
group. The control xenografts exhibited more highgrade pleomorphic cells in a fibromyxoid matrix and
a higher mitotic rate (P < 0.001) compared with the
MTAP-reexpressing xenografts primarily composed
of low-grade spindle cells. Immunohistochemically,
MTAP-reexpressing xenografts exhibited a significantly
reduced labeling of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Ki-67, as well
as decreased intratumoral vessels stained with the CD31
endothelial marker, substantiating the antiproliferative and
antiangiogenic attributes of MTAP in vivo.
MTAP protein deficiency was associated with increases
of proliferative index, microvessel density, and MMP-9
expression level in primary myxofibrosarcomas

DISCUSSION

In a subset common cohort of 40 primary
myxofibrosarcomas yielding informative scoring results
(Table S6, Figure S4), we further corroborated the in vitro
findings in clinical samples that MTAP protein deficiency
was highly associated with increased Ki-67 labeling index
(p < 0.001), microvessel density (p = 0.002) assessed
by CD31 staining [18], and MMP-9 expression levels
(p < 0.001) evaluated by H-score method [19].

Myxofibrosarcoma is a common, and genetically
complex sarcoma of histological and biological
heterogeneity, and its therapeutic mainstay is conducting
radical surgery to achieve clear margins [2, 3]. The
lack of effective molecular markers and standardized
chemoradiotherapeutic
regimen(s)
dictates
an
unfavorable prognosis in primary advanced and recurrent
myxofibrosarcomas [2, 3]. By integrating various
methodologies, we identified the clinical, biological, and
therapeutic relevance of MTAP deficiency, which was
observed in 37% of primary myxofibrosarcomas, strongly
linked to homozygous deletion or promoter methylation,
and independently predictive of adverse survival. However,
no inactivating mechanism was detected in the 3 MTAPdeficient cases, suggesting that MTAP downregulation
was caused by alternative molecular defects such as
small deletions of 5’ regions [20, 21]. On the other hand,
homozygous deletion of MTAP gene was detected in four
cases interpreted as MTAP-expressing. This conflicting
finding was most likely attributable to the existence of
intratumoral heterogeneity. Whatever whole-block or
tissue microarray sections, the MTAP-positive tumor cells
only ranged from 10% to 20% at most, which might not be
isolated in the process of laser capture microdissection and
therefore result in an underestimated gene ratio skewed
toward homozygous deletion. Compared with the equally
indolent MTAP-hypermethylated and MTAP-expressing
myxofibrosarcomas, MTAP-homozygously deleted tumors
were often high-grade and clinically aggressive. This
variation in the prognostic effect of MTAP gene abrogation
between distinct mechanisms in myxofibrosarcoma

L-alanosine inhibited MTAP-deficient
myxofibrosarcoma cells and xenografts by
inducing apoptosis
Because L-alanosine can completely abrogate AMP
supply in MTAP-deficient cells, we investigated whether
L-alanosine can effectively inhibit this aggressive subset
of myxofibrosarcomas by targeting the methionine de
novo pathway [13]. All myxofibrosarcoma cell lines
were incubated with indicated doses of L-alanosine for
72 h; this attenuated the cell viability in only the MTAPdeficient parent NMFH-2 and OH931 cells yielding IC50
values of approximately 1 μM and 5 μM, respectively,
but not in the MTAP-expressing NMFH-1 cells
(Figure 5B). Flow cytometry demonstrated a
significantly increased sub-G1 population in both
L-alanosine-treated OH931 and NMFH-2 cells, and
the induction of apoptosis, particularly prominent in
the NMFH-2 cells, was validated using annexin V/
propidium iodide staining assays (Figure S5). Stable
MTAP-reexpressing OH931 and NMFH-2 cells were
employed to explore how MTAP expression affected the

MTAP-deficient NMFH-2 and OH931 myxofibrosarcoma cell lines, and MTAP-expressing NMFH-1 cells were relatively resistant to
L-alanosine, demonstrating >50% viable sarcoma cells, even at 100 μM (left). Unlike the sensitivity in the parent lines and empty controls,
MTAP reexpression caused decreased susceptibility to L-alanosine in the OH931 (middle) and NMFH-2 (right) cells. (C) The average
tumor volume was significantly larger in the PBS-treated group than in the groups treated with 25 μM and 50 μM of L-alanosine (left). On
Day 42, the excised xenografts remained macroscopically larger and heavier in the control group, exhibiting no dose-dependent difference
between the groups treated with 25 μM and 50 μM of L-alanosine (middle). In contrast to the high-grade pleomorphic histology in the
control xenografts lacking apparent apoptosis, the L-alanosine-treated group exhibited increased numbers of fibrohyaline collagen fibers
and TUNEL-labeled apoptotic cells (right).

growth and in vivo tumorigenicity [9]. Although mice
heterozygous for germline MTAP mutations did not fully
recapitulate the genetic events in clinical specimens, they
were prone to developing T-cell lymphomas; however,
homozygous inactivation was embryonically lethal in the
MTAP-knockout murine model [11]. Because of these
conflicting findings, whether the loss of MTAP activity
is pathogenically relevant remains debated [9,  11,  12].
Given the clinical relevance of MTAP deficiency in
myxofibrosarcomas, we characterized the biology of
MTAP expression to clarify its functional effects on
cancer hallmark-related phenotypes. The antiproliferative
function of MTAP by the downregulation of cyclin D1
was validated using both MTAP knockdown in MTAPexpressing NMFH-1 cells and MTAP-reexpression in
MTAP-deficient NMFH-2 cells. Regarding the latter
condition, the growth-inhibiting attribute of MTAP was
reinforced by the reduced proliferation evidenced in the
ECIS measurements, few colonies in the soft-agar assays,

progression was concordant with our previous findings
regarding GISTs [22], indicating the probable random
occurrence of MTAP promoter methylation in the early
phase of myxofibrosarcoma tumorigenesis. However,
MTAP homozygous deletion represents a relatively
late genetic event in the tumor progression, which may
confer survival advantage to aggressive subclones of
myxofibrosarcoma cells and thereby culminate in negative
prognostic impact.
MTAP depletion is not uncommon in human
malignancies and is primarily attributable to homozygous
deletions spanning 9p21.3. MTAP deficiency may
occur without the loss of adjoining CDKN2A in nonsmall cell lung cancers and gliomas [13, 14, 23–26].
Instead of genomic losses, promoter hypermethylation
represents the preponderant inactivating mechanism in
MTAP-deficient hepatocellular carcinomas [21].

and low-grade histology of the corresponding xenografted
specimens exhibiting an underexpression of Ki-67 and
cyclin D1. We also corroborated the suppressive role
of MTAP in metastasis, which is the leading cause of
sarcoma-associated mortality and critically involves the
regulation of cell motility and transgression through an
extracellular matrix [2, 27, 28]. In MTAP-reexpressing
NMFH-2 cells, delayed closure in wound-healing assays
and decreased invading cells through matrix-coated
wells were measured and cross-validated by the reverse
results of MTAP-silenced NMFH-1 cells. Clinically, the
independent effect of MTAP deficiency on adverse MFS
in myxofibrosarcomas was reflective of these MTAPassociated antimigratory and antiinvasive functions.
In MTAP-reexpressing and shLacZ-transduced
myxofibrosarcoma cells, angiogenic capability was
significantly impaired, as indicated by reduced levels
of HUVEC-derived tube formation. Collectively, these
findings corroborated endogenous MTAP as a functional
suppressor that governs myxofibrosarcoma pathogenesis
by inhibiting tumor proliferation, metastasis, and
angiogenesis. In the luciferase reporter assay, the
antiangiogenic effect of MTAP was determined to
primarily link to the transcriptional repression of MMP-9,
ultimately attenuating mRNA and protein expression
in the myxofibrosarcoma cells. In the MTAP-deficient
xenografts and myxofibrosarcoma specimens, MMP-9
overexpression was present in the tumor cells and
extracellular stroma and associated with increased
microvessel density. These exemplified the oncogenic
role of MMP-9 in myxofibrosarcoma pathogenesis and
corresponded with previous reports on its associations with
aggressiveness in various cancer types [15, 28]. Kiroviski
reported that MTAP knockdown upregulated MMP-9
expression through the accumulation of 5’-deoxy-5’methylthioadenosine in hepatocellular carcinomas [29].
However, they neither elucidated the mechanistic link
between MTAP deficiency and MMP-9 nor characterized
the functional effect of this perturbed regulatory chain on
angiogenesis and metastasis.
Because MTAP is not a transcriptional factor, it
is conceivable to hypothesize that MTAP deficiency
indirectly transactivates an MMP-9 promoter, causing
resultant aggressive phenotypes. Recently, we reported
that the antiangiogenic function of ASS1, a rate-limiting
enzyme converting citrulline into arginine in the urea
cycle, was also attributable to the inhibition of ASS1
on MMP-9 expression in myxofibrosarcomas [15].
Evidently, aberrant losses of both MTAP in methionine
salvage and ASS1 in arginine metabolism may upregulate
ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and subsequently induce
overproduction of putrescine and other polyamines
[17, 30, 31]. This alteration is one of the first processes
involved in proliferating cells preceding nucleic acid
and protein syntheses and recently has been reported to

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

promote tumor development and progression involving
multiple cancer hallmarks [16, 30]. For instance, ODC
transformants were reported to increase secreted MMP-2
in vitro to enhance matrix degradation [30]. Analogously,
MMP-9 overexpression in the ASS1-deficient and MTAPdeficient myxofibrosarcomas is likely mediated by
overexpressed ODC, which converges growth-promoting
signals to orchestrate transcriptional regulation.
The disabled methionine salvage in MTAPinactivated myxofibrosarcomas renders this aggressive
tumor subset a tumor-specific metabolic feature for use
in L-alanosine therapy, which targets adenylosuccinate
synthetase to abolish de novo AMP synthesis from
IMP [13, 14, 30]. In vitro and in vivo, the growth
inhibition of MTAP-deficient tumors by L-alanosine was
partially ascribed to the induction of apoptosis, which
was evidenced by increased Annexin-V and TUNEL
labeling in myxofibrosarcomas and reported to be
mitochondria-dependent in mantle cell lymphomas [24].
In addition, we demonstrated that myxofibrosarcomas
fundamentally depended on MTAP deficiency regarding
their susceptibility to L-alanosine, which effectively
inhibited the MTAP-deficient cell lines and derived
xenografts and was well-tolerated by the mice. Since
several antimetabolites targeting purine synthesis are
available and additional drugs are in development [32–34],
the findings of this study suggest that MTAP-deficient
myxofibrosarcomas may benefit from the chemoselective
targeting of the defects in methionine-adenine recycling
and AMP synthesis.
In
summary,
MTAP
deficiency
in
myxofibrosarcomas, and particularly that caused by
homozygous deletion, negatively affects prognosis.
In vitro and in vivo, MTAP may act as a tumor suppressor,
serving antiangiogenic, antiproliferative, and antimigratory
or antiinvasive functions, and its deficiency represents a
potential therapeutic target of myxofibrosarcomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of aCGH
Twelve
fresh
tumor
specimens
and
3  myxofibrosarcoma cell lines (OH931, NMFH-1, and
NMFH-2) underwent oligonucleotide-based aCGH
profiling (NimbleGen), as previously detailed [7, 15]. The
raw data from the aCGH profiling were log2-transformed
and output into Nexus software (BioDiscovery). To
delineate the breakpoints in the genome-wide array
probes, the gains and losses in the critical regions of
the CNAs were defined as log2 ratios of ≥ +0.20 and
≤ −0.20, respectively. The amplification and homozygous
deletion were defined as log2 ratios of ≥ +0.50 or ≤ −0.50,
respectively. To unravel causal genes exhibiting copy
number-driven deregulated expression, the common

primers targeting methylated and unmethylated promoters
of MTAP gene, as previously described [22].

Cell culture, transfection, and RNA interference

Tumor materials

The culture conditions of the OH931, NMFH-1,
and NMFH-2 myxofibrosarcoma cell lines, CCD966SK
dermal fibroblasts, and human umbilical venous
endothelial cells (HUVECs, H-UV001) were previously
described [15] and were authenticated using short tandemrepeat fingerprinting in December, 2013.
Regarding
the
MTAP reexpression
in
MTAP-deleted OH931 and NMFH-2 cells, a
full-length pMTAP-DDK-Myc expression plasmid and
empty pCMV6 vector were purchased from Origene
and validated using sequencing. In a 24-well plate, 105
cells from OH931 or NMFH-2 myxofibrosarcoma cell
lines were seeded and incubated with lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogene) for 4 h at 37°C to transfect various
plasmids (1.5 µg), then cultured for a further 24 h at
37°C, and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega).
Cells stably expressing MTAP or DDK-Myc tags alone
were selected using neomycin. The transfected cells
were analyzed for exogenous MTAP expression using
western blotting. To evaluate the MMP-9 promoter
activity, an empty pGL vector and pG-MMP-9-promoter
were cotransfected with a pCMV6 control or a pMTAPDDK-Myc vector into myxofibrosarcoma cells [35].
After 48 h, the cells underwent luciferase assays by using
a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and normalized for
the transfection efficiency of pRL vector.
To silence the endogenous MTAP expression
in NMFH-1 cells, lentiviral vectors were obtained
from the Taiwan National RNAi Core Facility. Viruses
were produced by transfecting HEK293 cells with
the control pLKO.1-shLacZ (TRCN0000072223:
5ʹ-TGTTCGCATTAT
CCGAACCAT-3ʹ)
and
pLKO.1-shMTAP
(TRCN0000005883:
5ʹ-CCTGAATGATTTAGACAAC-3ʹ
and
TRCN0000005885: 5ʹ-CCTTCTATGATGGAAGTCA-3ʹ)
using Lipofectamine 2000. For viral infection, 3 × 106
NMFH-1 cells were incubated with 8 mL of lentivirus in the
presence of polybrene, followed by puromycin selection to
produce stable clones of lentivirus-transduced cells.

An institutional review board (97-2190A3)
approved the retrieval of myxofibrosarcomas resected
with curative intent. Those undergoing neoadjuvant
radiation, chemotherapy or aCGH profiling were
excluded. Table 1 lists the 87 independent primary
formalin-fixed
myxofibrosarcomas
successfully
analyzed for MTAP gene dosage, promoter methylation,
and immunoexpression.

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue microarray sections were antigenretrieved, incubated with antibodies targeting MTAP
(1:100, Proteintech), Ki-67 (1:200, abcam), MMP-9
(1:50, Epitomics), and CD31 (1:50, BD Pharmingen),
and detected using the ChemMate EnVision kit. The
cutoff value of <  10% cytoplasmic reactivity to define
aberrant MTAP loss was previously described [22]. The
scoring criteria of determining the levels of intratumoral
microvessel density [18] and MMP-9 expression by
H-score method [19] were as previously reported. Whole
sections of xenografted specimens were stained with
MTAP (1:50, Proteintech), cyclin D1 (1:100, Epitomics),
cyclin E (1:20, Abcam), Ki-67 (1:200, abcam), MMP-9
(1:50, Epitomics), CD31 (1:50, BD Pharmingen), and
TUNEL (Roche) for labeling apoptotic cells.

MTAP dosage quantification
As described in Supplementary Method-S1, realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on
MTAP exon 8 in duplicate for each case to detect the MTAP
gene dosage. PIK3R1 (5q13.1) was the reference gene that
exhibited no detectable CNAs in the aCGH. Standard curves
were constructed using serial dilutions of human genomic
DNA (Clontech). For each specimen, approximately
3000 tumor cells were microdissected using the Veritas
LCM machine (Arcturus) to extract genomic DNA. The
MTAP/PIK3R1 ratio < 0.2 was considered a homozygous
deletion, assuming that the normal tissue contamination
and intratumoral heterogeneity accounted for < 20% of the
experimental deviation. Regarding the 3 myxofibrosarcoma
cell lines, homozygous deletion was determined when no
MTAP gene copy was detected but PIK3R1 was amplifiable,
i.e.the MTAP/PIK3R1 ratio approximating zero.

Quantification of transcripts of MTAP and
angiogenesis-associated genes
As detailed in Method-S2, real-time reversetranscription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using the
ABI StepOnePlus™ System to measure MTAP mRNA
abundance in all myxofibrosarcoma cell lines. To explore
antiangiogenic mediators of MTAP, an RT-PCR expression
array (PAHS-024, SABioscience) was profiled for NMFH2 cells. Those genes differentially expressed between

MTAP-reexpressing and empty conditions were identified
based on P < 0.001, > 5-fold changes, and Ct values  30
for both tested and housekeeping genes. These candidates
were further screened in all myxofibrosarcoma cell
lines using western blots to assay molecules exhibiting
corresponding protein alterations under varying MTAP
reexpression or knockdown experiments.

16 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice
(BioLasco) and allowed to grow until 30 d after cell
implantation. To analyze the in vivo therapeutic effect of
L-alanosine, 4 × 106 parent NMFH-2 cells were inoculated
into 24 SCID mice, which were allowed to grow until 10 d
postinjection (Day 0), and then randomized into 3 groups
(n = 8 each) receiving 25 μM or 50 μM of L-alanosine,
or PBS. The treatment was continued for 6 wk and the
mice were euthanized 42 d posttreatment. The tumor
volume was calculated using the formula: V=π/6 × length
(mm) × width (mm)2.

Western blots
To visualize protein expression alterations,
Method-S3 details the western blots, sources of primary
antibodies against MTAP, G1- and G1/S transitionassociated cell cycle regulators, and RT-PCR expression
array-selected angiogenesis-associated mediators. The
proteins consistently downregulated or upregulated by
MTAP reexpression in MTAP-deficient OH931 and
NMFH-2 cells were reappraised in endogenously MTAPexpressing NMFH-1 cells transduced with shMTAP or
shLacZ.

Statistical analysis
The associations and comparisons among various
parameters were evaluated using chi-square, Student t, or
Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate to assess the MTAP
gene status and MTAP immunoexpression. Follow-up data
were available for 83 patients, and the median follow-up
time was 30.6 mo. The endpoints were metastasis-free
survival (MFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).
Univariate survival analyses were compared using a logrank test. A multivariate model was performed using a Cox
regression, including parameters with univariate P < 0.05.
For cell line and xenograft samples, a Student’s t-test was
used to analyze the functional and pharmacological assays.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
After the aforementioned cross-validations were
conducted, the identified molecule(s) exhibiting the same
trend in changes in protein abundance, as modulated by
the MTAP expression level, underwent ELISA to quantify
their concentration in corresponding conditioned media, as
detailed in Method-S4.
