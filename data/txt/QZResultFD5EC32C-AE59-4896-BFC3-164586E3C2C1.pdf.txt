BACKGROUND: The anticipated clinical outcome of the standard/control arm is an important parameter in the design of randomized
phase 3 (RP3) trials to properly calculate sample size, power, and study duration. Changing patterns of care or variation in the study population enrolled may lead to a deviation from the initially anticipated outcome. The authors hypothesized that recent changes in patterns
of care in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have led to challenges in correctly estimating the outcome of control groups. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted for RP3 trials of EOC published between January 2000 and December 2010. The expected
outcome of the control arm as well as the actual outcome achieved by this cohort was collected and a ratio (actual-over-expected ratio)
was calculated. The estimation of outcome was deemed accurate if the outcome of the control arm was between 0.75 to 1.25 times the
anticipated outcome. RESULTS: A total of 35 trials were eligible for analysis. Fifteen trials had survival as the primary endpoint whereas
20 had a progression-based primary endpoint. In total, 12 of 15 trials with a survival-based endpoint significantly underestimated the outcome of the control arm, whereas only 4 of 20 trials with a progression-based endpoint did. Studies with a survival endpoint underestimated outcome more frequently than those with a progression endpoint (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival of the control arm has
frequently been underestimated in recent EOC RP3 trials. This underestimation means that the initial statistical assumptions of these trials
may have been inaccurate. Underestimating the outcome of the control arm may result in trials being underpowered to demonstrate the

INTRODUCTION
When designing a randomized phase 3 (RP3) trial, an appropriate sample size calculation is necessary to ensure adequate
study power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the experimental and standard arms. The majority
of trial designs estimate the required sample size by incorporating 2 variables: the expected outcome for the standard/control arm and the size effect hypothesized for the experimental treatment or, in other words, the magnitude of the benefit
the experimental arm is expected to confer relative to the standard arm.1 Thus, accurate estimation of the control arm outcome is necessary in order for initial sample size calculations to be precise and reliable.
The basic concepts of trial design evolve from the initial selection of the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The consequent treatment effect is intimately related and integral to the calculation of the sample size to achieve
adequate statistical power.2 Type I (a) errors and type II (b) errors are central concepts in this process.2 A type I error is the
probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when in fact it is true: a false-positive result.2 This in general is set at a low value
(conventionally 0.05).2 A type II error is the probability of accepting the null hypothesis when in fact it is false: a falsenegative result.2 The power of the study reflects the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (1-b).2 Sample
size calculation is an exercise in determining the number of participants required to simultaneously achieve both the
desired power and type I error.3 Although this is a simplistic explanation of the concepts of trial design and neglects many
of the important intricacies, it emphasizes that inaccurate estimation of any of these components potentially compromises
the ultimate results of the trial, even before it has started.
The expected outcome in the control arm is generally inferred from completed clinical trials, using historical data
from comparable patient populations treated with similar therapies. However, it is recognized that correctly estimating

the outcome of a contemporaneous population is difficult, because variations in patient population, changes in
treatment patterns, and random error can result in a significant deviation from even the most robust historical
data.4
Estimating the outcome of women treated for
advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) may be
particularly challenging given the surgical and therapeutic
advances made over the last decades, which have significantly influenced patient outcomes. Up until the early
1980s, standard-of-care chemotherapy for patients with
advanced-stage EOC was cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. In <30 years, platinum agents, taxanes, and several
other chemotherapeutic drugs have been incorporated
into the routine care of patients with EOC. This coupled
with improved access to standard therapy and surgery has
resulted in survival gains both in the first-line setting and
among patients with recurrent disease. In contrast to trials
performed in the early 1980s, in which the median survival in phase 2 and 3 trials ranged from 15 to 24
months,5,6 the median survival times published in the last
decade have ranged from 36 to 40 months.7,8
We hypothesized that this improvement in reported
survival in conjunction with changes in treatment patterns
and standard of care has led to challenges when estimating
the expected control arm outcome in RP3 trials reported
within the past decade. To test this hypothesis, a systematic literature review was conducted to assess the accuracy
of control arm outcome predictions in RP3 trials of
patients with advanced-stage EOC that were published or
reported from 2000 through 2010.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Selection

Trials with the following characteristics were included:
RP3 clinical trials performed among patients with EOC
comparing 1 systemic treatment (experimental arm) over
another (control arm). Only trials in which the primary
outcome was overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or time to disease progression (TTP) were
included. Trials reporting different primary endpoints
(eg, response rate, quality of life) were excluded. Trials
had to state explicitly the expected outcome of the control
arm used for sample size calculation (either in the publication or in an appendix) and the actual or estimated outcome of the control arm once the study was finished.
Trials with a non-inferiority design were excluded.
Data Analysis

Trials were screened for eligibility and data were collected
using standardized collection forms. Data retrieved
included publication details, methodological components, and trial characteristics such as sample size, interventions, and outcome measures. The expected control
arm outcome used for sample size calculation, hypothesized experimental arm outcome, and finally the actual or
estimated result achieved by the control arm in the trial
was recorded. To allow analysis, whenever the expected or
actual result was stated as a percentage of patients at a
given time point, the result was transformed to a median
using an exponential model. If the expected outcome of
the control arm and sample size were modified at an interim analysis because of significant imprecision, the parameters used at the time of the initial trial design were
used for the primary analysis. However, the revised interim parameters were collected for a separate analysis.

Search Strategy

A search in MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted for
studies published in the English language between January 2000 and December 2010. Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) terms were “random allocation” AND “ovarian
neoplasm.” Keywords were (“ovarian” AND “neoplasm”)
OR “ovarian neoplasm” OR (“ovarian” and “cancer”) OR
“ovarian cancer” AND (“random” AND “allocation”)
OR “random allocation” OR “randomized.”
Citation lists of relevant publications were also
reviewed for articles that might have been missed with the
search strategy. Finally, abstracts from the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology
(ESMO) from 2008 through 2010 were reviewed to
include reported yet unpublished trials.

Statistical Analysis

A simple ratio of the actual (A) outcome of the control
arm for the primary endpoint divided by the expected (E)
outcome used for sample size calculation was calculated
(the A/E ratio). When the expected outcome was stated as
a median, a ratio of the A/E median was calculated. When
the expected outcome was stated as a percentage of
patients at a precise time point, this was transformed to a
median result assuming an exponential distribution. For
example, if the 5-year survival rate was reported to be
40%, this was transformed to a median using the following calculation: median 5 (log (0.5)/log(0.4))*5 5 3.8. In
this scenario, the median survival would have been
reported to be 3.8 years. This allowed for the calculation
of a median when only 1 survival rate was known at a

prerequired criteria and were included in the current analysis. In addition, 3 additional unpublished trials met all
eligibility criteria: 2 from the ESMO annual meeting
abstracts and 1 from the ASCO annual meeting
abstracts.12-14 A total of 35 trials met all prespecified criteria and were included in the analysis (Fig. 1). Of these 35
trials, 15 had OS as a primary endpoint and 20 had either
PFS or TTP as a primary endpoint.
For 10 trials, the outcomes for the expected and/or
actual primary endpoint were transformed from a percentage of patients alive at a fixed time to a median survival assuming an exponential distribution.15-24 This was
then used to calculate the A/E ratio.

certain time point. Once the median value was calculated,
it was used to determine the A/E ratio.
An A/E ratio of 0.75 to 1.25 was defined as reflecting an accurate prediction. This was based on the premise
that a 25% difference in the actual versus expected outcome was likely to be clinically and statistically relevant. It
was believed that this degree of imprecision was sufficient
to cause inaccurate initial power calculations. Thus, a ratio of >1.25 was considered as underestimation whereas a
ratio of <0.75 was termed an overestimation. For analysis, studies were stratified by whether the primary endpoint was survival-based (OS) or progression-based (PFS
or TTP).
A Wilcoxon 2-sample test was used to compare the
A/E ratios of survival-based trials with those of
progression-based trials to assess whether one of the 2
strata tended to be more inaccurate than the other. The
significance level was set at an alpha error of .05.

Trials With a Survival-Based Primary Endpoint

Fifteen trials with OS as a primary endpoint met all criteria (Table 1).13,15,16,18-29 Twelve trials underestimated
the actual OS as defined by an A/E ratio >1.25, whereas 3
trials were accurate in predicting OS as defined by an A/E
ratio of 0.75 to 1.25. None of the trials overestimated the
actual OS. The range of A/E calculated was from 1.0 to
4.7, with no trial having an A/E ratio of <1 (Fig. 2). The
mean and median of all ratios was 2.0 and 1.5,
respectively.
In 2 of these 15 trials, survival was severely underestimated, as reflected by A/E ratios of 4.3 and 4.7, respectively.21,24 In both of these trials, the expected survival in
the control arm was revised in interim protocol amendments. This resulted in more precise estimations (A/E ratio of 1.1 and 1.0, respectively). When using these revised
parameters, the mean and median of all ratios still
remained elevated at 1.5 and 1.4, respectively.
Of the 15 trials, 10 underestimated the control arm
outcome by such a margin that the control arm did better
than hypothesis for the experimental arm. This highlights
the degree of the underestimation.
Trials With a Progression-Based Primary
Endpoint

Twenty trials met all criteria with either PFS or TTP as a
primary endpoint. Four trials underestimated the actual
outcome (A/E ratio of >1.25), Eleven trials were accurate
(A/E ratio of 0.75-1.25), and 5 trials overestimated the
outcome (A/E ratio of 0.75) (Table 2).12,14,17,30-46 The
A/E ratios ranged from 0.5 to 1.6, with a mean and median ratio of 1.0 and 1.0, respectively (Fig. 3).

Comparison of the Accuracy of Predictions
of Survival-Based And Progression-Based
Endpoints

When compared with the 20 trials with a progressionbased primary outcome, the 15 trials with OS as a primary
endpoint were found to be significantly more likely to
underestimate the control arm outcome (Wilcoxon 2sample test, P<.001).
To account for potential random error introduced
by the inclusion of trials with small sample sizes, the 2
groups were compared again after excluding those in
which the control group sample size was <100 patients. A
total of 3 and 7 studies were excluded from the OS15,23,29
and PFS17,36,38,42-45 analyses, respectively. This confirmed a statistically significant difference (P 5 .001). A
secondary analysis was performed to account for the 2 trials in which the expected survival was updated at an interim analysis.21,24 Even with the revised expected
survival, there was statistically more underestimation
noted among survival-based trials than progression-based
trials (P 5 .002).
DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrate that for
EOC trials published over the past decade there has been
significant imprecision when estimating the control arm
outcome in RP3 trials. This imprecision is present in trials
with both progression-based and survival-based primary
endpoints. However the data presented herein indicate
that trials with an OS endpoint were significantly more
likely to underestimate the outcome of the control arm
than those using PFS or TTP as the endpoint.
A limitation of the current review is that relatively
few RP3 trials met all eligibility criteria. Approximately
Cancer

one-half of the EOC RP3 trials were excluded, in most
instances because of missing information regarding sample size calculations. This finding is perhaps not surprising
because it has previously been reported that information
regarding sample size calculation is frequently missing in
clinical trial publications.47 A further limitation is that
some of the trials included had a small sample size, sometimes as a result of poor accrual, and as such are subject to
random error. To minimize the potential impact of this
confounding factor, a sensitivity analysis was performed
excluding those trials with a small sample size. This demonstrated similar results to those observed in the analysis
of all trials.
It is important to consider why OS was significantly
underestimated when designing systemic therapy trials in
EOC. It is possible that changing patterns of care and
improvements in survival for patients with EOC during
the years these trials were designed and conducted may
have rendered historical data obsolete, causing investigators to underestimate the outcome anticipated with standard therapy. Improved surgical techniques and
consequent stage migration may also have had an impact
on OS estimations.
The time between the initial trial design and the completion of accrual typically spans many years. After the
completion of accrual, more time elapses until enough
events have occurred to analyze survival. Thus, even when
factoring in differences in patterns of care between reported
historical data and available care at the moment of study
design, it is possible that evolving therapy during the conduct of the trial may further confound these estimations.
It should be noted that since 1990, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin have

demonstrated efficacy in patients with EOC and have
been approved for treatment.32,39,48 Most recently, antiangiogenic agents have demonstrated effectiveness in
EOC clinical trials.7,8 The progressive introduction of
these agents in trials and in routine care during the conduct of the majority of the EOC trials published within
the last decade may well have caused actual survival to
deviate from historical controls.
Moreover, for many of the clinical trials included in
the current analysis, the experimental agents studied (eg,
topotecan, anthracyclines, and gemcitabine) were commercially available either during or after the study was
conducted, thereby raising the potential for off-trial crossover with the experimental agent in a percentage of
patients, further confounding, and possibly increasing
observed OS in control arms.

As a consequence of the small sample size, our ability
to delineate whether underestimation of OS is becoming
more problematic with time is hindered, but one would
expect this to be the case, reflecting increasing therapeutic
options after disease progression and a longer time to
accrue patients to trials. This issue is likely to be clinically
relevant in both the first-line and recurrent setting and
should be considered in the design of future research.
It is perhaps not surprising that such a prominent
underestimation of outcome is not observed when trials
use a progression-based endpoint. In contrast to PFS, OS
is a composite of both PFS and survival after disease progression.49 Time from treatment initiation until either
disease recurrence or progression is not influenced by
post-trial treatment nor crossover, making historical publications regarding the efficacy of a single treatment more

reliable than estimates of survival that reflect a sequence of
treatments that dynamically evolve as new drugs become
available.
When patients with metastatic disease such as ovarian
cancer develop disease progression, there are several potential interventions available including: 1) crossover; 2) treatment with an alternative agent; 3) continuation with the
same agent if there is symptomatic benefit; or 4) no further
therapy.49 The heterogeneity of these options makes it difficult to assess the influence (if any) of the initial randomized
therapy on OS due to the confounding and diluting effect
from each subsequent intervention.49 Fewer variables come
into play when estimating TTP or PFS than when estimating time to death. Moreover, the time to the event is
shorter, thereby leading to more predictable estimates.
The finding that OS has been underestimated
when designing EOC trials has potentially important
implications both for interpreting recently published trials and for designing future trials. A significant underestimation of the anticipated control arm outcome means
that the observed event rate will be lower than anticipated during the time the trial is being conducted.
Because sample size is proportional to the square power
of the difference in the event rate between the control
and experimental arms, the trials become underpowered
to detect a difference of the magnitude they were
designed for. As the event rate decreases, the sample size
will need to increase exponentially to demonstrate the
same absolute difference in survival. Table 3 illustrates
how relatively small changes in observed outcome and
relative size effect studied affect the sample size required
to maintain adequate statistical power to demonstrate
the same benefit.
Discrepancies between the expected and actual outcome of the control arm can potentially result in clinically
relevant survival differences being missed because of a lack
of sufficient statistical power. When the result of an endpoint is underestimated owing to lower event rates, the
trial duration is likely to be longer and more expensive
than anticipated. Consequently, it is concerning that
EOC trials published within the past decade were potentially underpowered to demonstrate the magnitude of
absolute survival benefit they were designed for despite
being longer and potentially more costly.
The difficulty in predicting and detecting OS
improvements has significant ramifications for regulatory
agencies that rely on these trials and the accurate determination of the size of the benefit to make funding decisions.
Furthermore, the underestimation of OS in most EOC trials published to date highlights the challenges in adequately
420

designing trials that are powered to demonstrate differences
in survival due to the number of variables requiring consideration. These challenges may be more problematic in
malignancies with a longer survival and many available
treatment options, such as EOC, low-grade lymphomas, or
breast cancer, compared with those with limited treatment
options and short survival times such as metastatic pancreatic or lung cancer. In contrast, among diseases in which
the median survival after disease progression has been classically shorter (ie, <12 months), such as advanced colorectal
cancer and non-small lung cancer, a stronger correlation
between PFS and OS has been demonstrated.49-51 This
may mean that OS is easier to predict in these diseases.
Data regarding the accuracy of trial survival predictions in
other disease sites need to be collected to formerly test this
hypothesis. However, this report highlights that when
designing a trial that is properly powered to address differences in OS in cancers with many treatment options, correctly estimating the control arm outcome can be
challenging.
The data from the current study highlight the difficulty inherent in estimating the actual outcome of a
cohort of patients. In EOC, this has led to an almost routine underestimation of expected survival in recently
reported RP3 trials. These challenges should be addressed
when designing future phase 3 trials in EOC as well as
other malignancies. Severely underestimating the control
arm outcome can lead to a trial being more complex and
expensive to conduct than initially planned but remaining
statistically underpowered to demonstrate the clinically
meaningful survival difference it was designed to detect.
