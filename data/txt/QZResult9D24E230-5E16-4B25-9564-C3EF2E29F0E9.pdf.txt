Abstract
Tamoxifen is one of the most widely used endocrine agents for the treatment of estrogen receptor a (ERa)–
positive breast cancer. Although effective in most patients, resistance to tamoxifen is a clinically signiﬁcant
problem and the mechanisms responsible remain elusive. To address this problem, we performed a large
scale loss-of-function genetic screen in ZR-75-1 luminal breast cancer cells to identify candidate resistance
genes. In this manner, we found that loss of function in the deubiquitinase USP9X prevented proliferation
arrest by tamoxifen, but not by the ER downregulator fulvestrant. RNAi-mediated attenuation of USP9X was
sufﬁcient to stabilize ERa on chromatin in the presence of tamoxifen, causing a global tamoxifen-driven
activation of ERa-responsive genes. Using a gene signature deﬁned by their differential expression after
USP9X attenuation in the presence of tamoxifen, we were able to deﬁne patients with ERa-positive breast
cancer experiencing a poor outcome after adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen. The signature was speciﬁc in
its lack of correlation with survival in patients with breast cancer who did not receive endocrine therapy.
Overall, our ﬁndings identify a gene signature as a candidate biomarker of response to tamoxifen in breast
cancer. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3810–20. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
About 70% of human breast cancers are estrogen receptor a
(ERa)–positive and depend on this hormone receptor for their
proliferation (1), rendering ERa an ideal target for endocrine
treatment. Tamoxifen is one of the most commonly used drugs
in the management of ERa-positive breast cancer. In early
breast cancer, 5 years of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen
almost halves the rate of disease recurrence and reduces the
annual breast cancer-related death rate by one-third (2).
Despite this adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, one-third of
women still develop recurrent disease in the next 15 years (2),
illustrating that endocrine resistance is a major problem in the
management of breast cancer.
Several mechanisms may contribute to tamoxifen resistance. At presentation, not all ERa-positive tumors are
sensitive to tamoxifen. This intrinsic endocrine resistance
can be the result of ERa phosphorylation (3–5). In addition,
intrinsic resistance is found to correlate with increased

levels or activity of ERa coactivators (AIB1), growth factor
receptors (EGFR, HER2, and IGF1R), kinases (AKT and
ERK1/2) or adaptor proteins (BCAR1, c-SRC, and PAK1;
refs. 3, 6). Loss of CDK10 expression (7) and loss of insulin-like growth factor–binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) expression (8) can also lead to tamoxifen resistance. Furthermore,
high levels of lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) or CUEDC2
protein are associated with tamoxifen resistance (9, 10).
ERa-independent mechanisms can play a role in endocrine
therapy resistance, including the NOTCH pathway (11).
Acquired endocrine resistance develops in a certain proportion of metastatic ERa-positive breast cancer that was
initially sensitive to palliative tamoxifen treatment, but can
also occur in the adjuvant setting when a patient relapses
while on hormonal therapy. Possible mechanisms of this
resistance are upregulation of the PI3K–mTOR pathway (12–
14) and acquiring activating mutations in ESR1 (15). It is
nevertheless likely that additional mechanisms contribute to
unresponsiveness to endocrine treatment, which remains to
be identiﬁed.
Ubiquitination serves a role in both protein degradation and
regulation of protein function (16). The level of protein ubiquitination is highly regulated by two families of enzymes with
opposing activities: the ubiquitin ligases, which add ubiquitin
moieties to proteins and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) that
remove them (17). The X-linked deubiquitinase USP9X is a
member of the family of DUB enzymes and regulates multiple
cellular functions by deubiquitinating and stabilizing its substrates. USP9X is involved in a number of key cellular processes,
as the knockout of this gene in the mouse is embryonic lethal
(18). USP9X has been shown to regulate, among others, cell

adhesion molecules like b-catenin and E-cadherin, cell polarity, chromosome segregation, NOTCH, mTOR, and TGFb
signaling as well as apoptosis (18–27).
To elucidate novel mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance in
breast cancer, we performed an shRNA screen in the hormone-dependent human luminal breast cancer cell line ZR75-1 to identify genes in which knockdown could induce
tamoxifen resistance. We report here an unexpected role for
USP9X in ERa signaling: loss of USP9X enhances ERa/chromatin interactions in the presence of tamoxifen, leading to
tamoxifen-stimulated gene expression of ERa target genes
and cell proliferation.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
Phoenix cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FCS, 2 mmol/L glutamine and 100 mg/mL penicillin/
streptomycin. ZR-75-1 and T47D cells were cultured under
the same conditions in the presence of 1 nmol/L estradiol. Cell
lines were obtained from the ATCC (www.ATCC.org) and used
at low passage after receipt from the vendor.
Transfection and retroviral infection
Phoenix cells were transfected using calcium phosphate
precipitation. Viral supernatant was cleared through a
0.45-mm ﬁlter. Target cells were infected twice with the viral
supernatant using polybrene (8 mg/mL). For transient transfection of ZR-75-1 cells Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies)
was used.
The shRNA screen and recovery of shRNA inserts
Ecotropic receptor–containing ZR-75-1 cells were infected
with the retroviral NKi pRetroSuper-shRNA library (12,540
shRNA vectors targeting 4,180 genes; ref. 28) or pRS as control.
After puromycin selection, cells were cultured in DMEM with
1 mmol/L 4OH-tamoxifen for 6 weeks. Genomic DNA of individual colonies was isolated using DNAzol (Life Technologies).
PCR ampliﬁcation of the shRNA cassettes was performed using
the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche). Products
were digested with EcoRI/XhoI and recloned into pRS and
sequenced with Big Dye Terminator (PerkinElmer). Primers
are in Supplementary Table S4.
Cell proliferation analyses
For colony formation assays, infected cells were cultured in
DMEM containing 1 mmol/L 4OH-tamoxifen, 1 nmol/L estradiol, or 107 mol/L fulvestrant. After 2 to 6 weeks, cells were
photographed, ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde, and stained with
0.1% Crystal violet. Plate conﬂuence was assessed by measuring the percentage of cell-covered surface area. Alternatively,
Crystal violet was extracted with 10% acetic acid and absorbance was measured at 600 nm.
For dynamic cell proliferation analyses, cells were seeded in
a clear-bottom 96-well plate and proliferation was determined
by plate conﬂuency using an IncuCyte life cell imaging device
(Essen BioScience). Three wells were measured per condition.
Bars indicate SD.

Constructs
For retroviral transductions, ZR-75-1 and T47D cells were
stably infected with supernatant of the Phoenix amphotrophic virus packaging cell line transfected with pBabeHygro-Ecotropic Receptor or pLZRS-Ecotropic Receptor-IRESNeo. Short hairpin sequences targeting USP9X are in Supplementary Table S4.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
For coimmunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in ELB (250
mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 50 mmol/L Hepes pH 7.3) containing protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (SigmaAldrich). Supernatants were incubated with antibodies for
USP9X (ab99343; Abcam), or ERa (D-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) coupled to protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies).
Mixed normal mouse and rabbit serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as control. For Western blotting the following
antibodies were used: USP9X (ab99343; Abcam), ERa (clone
1D5; Dako), progesterone receptor (PR; clone 1A6; Novocastra),
and b-actin (clone AC-74; Sigma-Aldrich).
Luciferase assay
Monoclonal ZR-75-1 cells expressing pRS-USP9X or pRS–
GFP, were plated in triplicate in 6-well plates and were transiently transfected with 1.75 mg ERE-TATA-luciferase reporter
and 0.5 mg pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase (Promega) per well.
24 hours after transfection, ligand was added. Luciferase
activity was determined 48 hours after transfection using the
Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), with Renilla
luciferase as control, with vehicle set at 1.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies) or
using the Quick RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research). cDNA was
generated using Superscript II with random hexamer primers
(Life Technologies). The qRT-PCR reaction was performed
using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) on
an AB7500 Fast Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).
All reactions were run in parallel for GAPDH to control for the
amount of cDNA input.
PCR primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table
S4.
RNA expression analysis
RNA-seq reads (14–30 million 50-bp single-end) were
mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using TopHat
(29), supplied with a known set of gene models (Ensembl
version 64). HTSeq count was used to obtain gene expressions.
To identify differentially expressed genes, DEGseq (30) was
used, P < 0.05. Levels of expressed genes were increased by 1 to
avoid negative values after log2 transformation.
Chromatin immunoprecipitations
Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) were performed
as described before (31). For each ChIP, 10 mg ERa antibody
(HC-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 100 mL of Protein A
Dynabeads (Life Technologies) were used. For qPCR, primers
are in Supplementary Table S4.

Next-generation sequencing and enrichment analysis
ChIP DNA was ampliﬁed as described previously (31).
Sequences were generated by the Illumina Hiseq 2000 genome
analyzer (using 50 bp reads), and aligned to the Human
Reference Genome (assembly hg19; February 2009). Enriched
regions of the genome were identiﬁed by comparing the ChIP
samples with input using MACS (32) version 1.3.7.1. Details on
sequence reads are Supplementary Table S1.
Motif analysis, heatmaps, and genomic distributions of
binding events
ChIP-seq data snapshots were generated using the Integrative Genome Viewer IGV 2.1 (www.broadinstitute.org/igv/).
Motif analyses were performed through the Cistrome (cistrome.org), applying the SeqPos motif tool (33). The genomic
distributions of binding sites were analyzed using the cisregulatory element annotation system (34). If the binding
region is within a gene, 50 untranslated region (UTR), 30 UTR,
coding exon, or intron are determined. Promoter is deﬁned as
3 kb around RefSeq 50 start. If a binding site is >3 kb away from
the RefSeq transcription start site (TSS), it is considered distal
intergenic.
Survival analyses
Normalized mRNA expression for four patient series was
downloaded from GEO: GSE6532 (35), GSE22219 (36), GSE2034
(37), and GSE11121 (38). From these, two sets of ER-positive,
tamoxifen-treated patients (n ¼ 250, ref. 35; n ¼ 134, ref. 36),
and two sets of ER-positive–untreated patients (n ¼ 209, ref. 37;
n ¼ 158, ref. 38) were extracted, for which follow-up was
available. ER status for the Schmidt and colleagues data (38)
is absent in the publicly available data and was determined by
ﬁtting a two-component Gaussian mixture to the expression of
the ESR1 gene, which was veriﬁed to follow a bimodal distribution. Probes in the Buffa and colleagues (36), Wang and
colleagues (37), and Schmidt and colleagues (38) data were
median-centered before further processing; the Loi and colleagues data had already been median-centered. The 526 genes
of the USP9X knockdown tamoxifen signature were mapped to
the corresponding microarray platforms by selecting all probes
for matching genes, and ignoring genes not present on the
array. For the Loi and colleagues (35) data, these selected 949
probe sets represent 488 different genes. For the Buffa and
colleagues (36) data, 363 probes were selected representing 295
genes and for both the Wang and colleagues (37) and the
Schmidt and colleagues (38) datasets, 653 probe sets representing 391 genes were available. Of note, 254 of the signature
genes were present on all three array platforms. Patients were
stratiﬁed into two groups by applying a hierarchical completelinkage clustering using Pearson correlation distance, and
dividing by the ﬁrst split of the clustering. Signiﬁcant differences in distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) time between
these two groups were tested for using the log-rank test.
Survival times longer than 10 years were right-censored. The
array platform used for the untreated Wang and colleagues (37)
and Schmidt and colleagues (38) datasets provides a subset of
the probes available for the treated Loi and colleagues data
(653 of 949; ref. 35). To verify that this difference does not affect

3812

the comparison between treated and untreated, the Loi and
colleagues (35) samples were additionally clustered on the
basis of this subset only. This clustering was still able to stratify
patients according to prognosis (log-rank P ¼ 1.3  105). The
directionality of USP9X knockdown tamoxifen classiﬁcation
genes in the good and poor outcome patient groups in the Loi
and colleagues (35) cohort is shown in Supplementary Table
S2. Association of the USP9X knockdown tamoxifen signature
with outcome after chemotherapy was tested on the subset of
the 295 patients in the van de Vijver and colleagues cohort (39)
with ER-positive breast tumors, treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, but not with tamoxifen (n ¼ 56). Patients were
stratiﬁed in two groups and the difference in survival was
tested for as described above. The gene signature mapped to
758 probes representing 461 unique genes. PAM50 (40) subtyping by genefu package was applied to a pooled set of breast
cancer samples (n ¼ 1,570; GEO accession: GSE47561; ref. 41),
including the Loi and colleagues study, ensuring correct
assignment of molecular subtypes.

Results
An shRNA screen identiﬁes USP9X as a tamoxifen
resistance gene
To identify new genes involved in tamoxifen resistance, a
loss-of-function genetic screen was performed in the human
luminal breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1 that expressed the
murine ecotropic receptor. Cells were infected with retroviral
supernatants containing a selection of the NKi pRS–shRNA
library (12,540 shRNA vectors targeting 4,180 genes) or pRS as
control (Fig. 1A; ref. 28). Library-infected cells and control
cells were plated at low density and cultured in DMEM with
1 mmol/L 4OH-tamoxifen for 6 weeks. Individual colonies that
grew out in the presence of tamoxifen were collected, genomic
DNA was isolated and shRNA cassettes were recovered by PCR.
These shRNA cassettes were subsequently recloned and
sequenced. This led to the identiﬁcation of USP9X. To conﬁrm
that knockdown of USP9X was responsible for the rescue of the
tamoxifen-induced proliferation arrest, ZR-75-1 cells were
infected with high titer shUSP9X and control virus. Proliferation in the presence of estradiol (E2) or tamoxifen (4-OHT) was
determined in a colony formation assay (Fig. 1B). To exclude
that the escape from tamoxifen-induced proliferation arrest
was the result of an "off-target effect," ﬁve additional shRNAs
targeting different regions of the USP9X gene were designed. Figure 1C shows that three shRNAs had the identical
phenotype: Infected cells grew out despite tamoxifen treatment. Importantly, only the vectors that suppressed USP9X
mRNA (Fig. 1D) and protein levels (Fig. 1E) induced tamoxifen
resistance. To ask whether the rescue from tamoxifen-induced
proliferation arrest is independent of cellular context, we
tested two USP9X shRNA vectors for their ability to confer
tamoxifen resistance in a second luminal breast cancer cell
line: T47D. Knocking down USP9X in T47D cells enabled cell
growth in the presence of tamoxifen as well, suggesting that
USP9X suppression leads to tamoxifen resistance independent
of the cellular context (Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly,
knockdown of USP9X did not rescue cells from a proliferation

Knockdown of USP9X increases ERa activity through

Next, we examined whether the rescue from tamoxifeninduced proliferation arrest was the result of increased ERa
signaling. ZR-75-1 cells stably expressing pRS–USP9X

First, we tested whether knockdown of USP9X increased
ERa activity under the conditions used in the shRNA
screen. Figure 2A shows that USP9X knockdown (USP9XKD)
cells have increased luciferase activity, both when cultured
in normal culture media (DMEM/FCS) and when cultured
in the presence of 4OH-tamoxifen. Next, we performed
luciferase assays on cells grown in phenol red-free DMEM,
supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped (and hence
steroid-free) serum in the presence of vehicle, estradiol,

4OH-tamoxifen, or a combination of estradiol þ 4OHtamoxifen. Figure 2B shows that under all these conditions
ERa signaling is about 2.5 times higher in the USP9XKD cell line
as compared with the control cell line. To conﬁrm the stimulating effect of USP9X knockdown on ERa signaling, ZR-75-1
cells, stably expressing pRS–USP9X or pRS–GFP, cultured
in the presence of indicated ligand, were analyzed for ERa
target gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, knockdown
of USP9X resulted in increased mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein
levels (Fig. 2D) of PR, Trefoil factor 1 (TFF1/PS2), and of ERa
itself (42).
Given the functional interaction between USP9X and ERa, we
next tested whether ERa and USP9X physically interact. Figure
3 shows that ERa coimmunoprecipitates with USP9X in estradiol- and tamoxifen-treated ZR-75-1 cells, demonstrating the
existence of a physical complex of these proteins under

3814

physiologic conditions, which was recently also shown using
mass spectrometry by Stanisic and colleagues (43).
USP9X loss selectively enhances ERa/chromatin
interactions upon 4OH-tamoxifen treatment
Knockdown of USP9X gave rise to both tamoxifen resistance and ERa-responsive gene activation. Next, the effects of
USP9X knockdown on ERa/chromatin interactions were tested for hormone-depleted (vehicle), estradiol and tamoxifen
conditions, using ChIP, followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). ZR-75-1 cells stably expressing pRS–USP9X or
pRS–GFP (control) were plated in hormone-depleted medium
for 72 hours. Typically, ERa ChIP-seq experiments are performed after a treatment for 45 minutes with ligand (44, 45),
even though 3 hours of treatment is also used (46, 47). Because
USP9X suppression causes long-term resistance to tamoxifen,

USP9XKD cells as well as for the sites selectively induced by
USP9X knockdown (Fig. 4G).
Collectively, these data show that USP9X knockdown
induces ERa-binding events, selectively in the presence of
4OH-tamoxifen, that represent a subset of estradiol-induced
sites and do not deviate from normal ERa behavior with
respect to genomic distributions and DNA motif enrichment.

Figure 3. Physical interaction between USP9X and ERa. Hormonedeprived ZR-75-1 cells were treated with either E2 or 4-OHT.
Immunoprecipitations were performed with nonimmune serum (ni, lanes
3 and 6), anti-ERa (lanes 4 and 7), or anti-USP9X (lanes 5 and 8)
antibodies. Western blots were incubated with ERa and USP9X
antibodies. Lanes 1 and 2 show 5% input of the whole-cell lysate.

we studied ERa biology after continued ligand treatment
and the effects of USP9X knockdown thereon. Therefore, the
cells were treated with vehicle, estradiol or 4OH-tamoxifen for
48 hours before the ChIP assay. In control cells, estradiol
treatment greatly enhanced ERa/chromatin interactions,
although this was far less pronounced when treating the
cells with 4OH-tamoxifen. USP9X knockdown had no effect
on ERa/chromatin interactions in vehicle- and estradiol-treated cells, but signiﬁcantly increased chromatin binding upon
4OH-tamoxifen treatment, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 4A. Enhanced
ERa/chromatin interactions under tamoxifen conditions
were also observed when cells were treated for 45 minutes
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The stabilization of ERa/chromatin
interactions in the presence of 4OH-tamoxifen could be generalized throughout the genome, as illustrated by visualizing
the union of all peaks found for shGFP (5,855 sites) and
shUSP9X (6,828 sites) in a heatmap (Fig. 4B) and expressed
in a quantiﬁed format in a 2D graph (Fig. 4C). This increased
intensity of ERa/chromatin interactions in 4OH-tamoxifen–
treated cells also translated into a signiﬁcant increase in the
number of chromatin-binding events, representing a subset
of the estradiol-induced binding patterns under the same
conditions (Fig. 4D). The subgroups of binding sites for control
cells and USP9XKD cells, either or not shared between ligand
conditions (Fig. 4D), were separately analyzed in a heatmap
visualization and quantiﬁed (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Comparing control with USP9XKD under the same ligand
conditions showed gained sites both for estradiol and 4OHtamoxifen conditions, whereas this was not the case for
vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 4E). ERa rarely binds promoters
(5%), and the vast majority of ERa-binding events is found at
distal enhancers (44). We could conﬁrm these data for estradiol
and 4OH-tamoxifen conditions, both in control and USP9XKD
cells (Fig. 4F). Vehicle-treated cells showed enrichment of ERa
binding to promoters as was found before (46), which was not
inﬂuenced by knockdown of USP9X. The gained ERa-binding
events for USP9XKD cells under tamoxifen conditions showed
identical distributions as found for estradiol- and tamoxifentreated control cells. De novo DNA motif enrichment analyses
for ERa-binding sites in 4OH-tamoxifen–treated cells provided
ESR motifs, both for sites shared between control cells and

USP9X and global gene-expression analyses
Our ChIP-seq analyses indicate that USP9X knockdown
selectively enhances ERa/chromatin interactions in the presence of tamoxifen that are normally found enriched for estradiol conditions. We, therefore, tested whether USP9X knockdown in tamoxifen-treated cells would also give rise to a typical
estradiol-responsive gene set. To address this, we performed
RNA-seq on ZR-75-1 cells stably expressing pRS–USP9X or
pRS–GFP (control) that—after hormone depletion for
72 hours—were treated for 48 hours with vehicle, estradiol,
or 4OH-tamoxifen. Estradiol treatment resulted in altered
expression of 8,794 genes as compared with vehicle, whereas
after 4OH-tamoxifen treatment 1,906 genes were differentially
expressed. All altered transcripts under 4OH-tamoxifen conditions represented a subset of the estradiol-responsive genes
(Fig. 5A, left). 4OH-tamoxifen treatment in USP9XKD cells as
compared with 4OH-tamoxifen–treated control cells resulted
in an altered expression of 6,210 transcripts, 4,336 of which
were shared with estradiol induction in control cells (Fig. 5A,
right). Furthermore, integrating these differentially expressed
genes in 4OH-tamoxifen–treated USP9XKD cells with the ChIPseq data showed that a subgroup of these genes, 526 of 4,336
genes (Fig. 5B), is enriched for proximal ERa-binding events,
with a chromatin-binding event within 20 kb from the TSS. This
window of 20 kb represents the optimal window to identify
ERa-responsive genes (48). This is a selective enrichment over
the total genomic background, in which 3,001 of all 45,054
RefSeq genes were found to have a proximal ERa-binding event
(Fisher exact test; P ¼ 8.099E30). Analyzing the raw readcount of the ChIP-seq experiments under 4OH-tamoxifen
showed that also the ChIP-seq signal intensity of proximal
ERa-binding events was selectively increased after USP9X
knockdown (Fig. 5C).
A USP9X knockdown tamoxifen gene-expression
signature identiﬁes patients with breast cancer with a
poor outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment
The RNA-seq analyses revealed that the majority of genes
that were differentially expressed upon tamoxifen treatment in
the USP9XKD cells represented a subgroup of estradiol-induced
genes (4,336 of 8,794 genes; see Fig. 5A, right), of which 526 of
4,336 genes with a proximal ERa-binding site (Fig. 5B) are
expected to be under the direct control of ERa under 4OHtamoxifen conditions. This particular subgroup of genes most
likely represents a direct ERa target gene signature in contrast
with the (potentially indirectly regulated) genes that were not
enriched for ERa binding. Because these directly ERa-regulated genes would also be the genes that are directly affected
under tamoxifen-resistant conditions, differential expression
of these particular genes in breast tumors could hallmark

tamoxifen unresponsiveness. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether these genes were differentially expressed in a
publically available dataset of 250 predominantly postmenopausal patients with primary ERa-positive breast cancer with
known outcome (35). All these patients received adjuvant
tamoxifen. For all clinicopathologic parameters, see Supplementary Table S3. As visualized in a heatmap (Fig. 5D),
unsupervised clustering on the basis of our gene signature
resulted in the identiﬁcation of two distinct subgroups of
patients. These subgroups of patients were subsequently analyzed for differential distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)
after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Figure 5E, ﬁrst, shows that
this gene set identiﬁes a subgroup of patients with breast
cancer with a poor response to tamoxifen treatment (P ¼ 9.4 
105). These data could be validated using a second cohort of
134 mostly postmenopausal patients with ERa-positive breast
cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen (Fig. 5E, second; P ¼
7.3  103; ref. 36). We then tested our signature on two cohorts
of mainly postmenopausal patients with ERa-positive breast
cancer (37, 38) who did not receive any adjuvant endocrine
treatment. Importantly, in these patients the USP9X knockdown tamoxifen gene-expression signature did not correlate
with outcome, indicating that the gene signature is not prognostic (Fig. 5E, right). Patients identiﬁed as responsive, based
on our USP9X-based gene signature were mostly of the luminal
A subtype, whereas resistant-classiﬁed patients were more
often of the luminal B subtype, as identiﬁed by PAM50 (Fig.
5F; refs. 40, 41). However, still approximately 30% of luminal B
tumors were classiﬁed as tamoxifen sensitive and approximately 30% of luminal A tumors were classiﬁed as tamoxifen
resistant, suggesting that our gene signature can be used to
identify subgroups of luminal A and luminal B tumors that
beneﬁt most from adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. The gene
signature was selective for endocrine treatment, because our
signature was not able to classify patients with ERa-positive
tumors treated with adjuvant chemotherapy only, albeit this
group of patients was small (Supplementary Fig. S6; ref. 39).
The majority of genes that are differentially expressed upon
tamoxifen treatment in the USP9XKD cells were shared with
estradiol induction. However, 1,874 of the differentially
expressed genes were not estrogen affected (Fig. 5A, right).
These 1,874 genes were not linked with estrogen function or
endocrine resistance, but ingenuity pathway analysis enrichment and gene ontology analysis showed enrichment for
mitochondrial function (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).
Expression-based gene signatures for these 1,874 genes
did not classify patients in the Buffa and colleagues cohort
[P ¼ 0.25; HR, 1.4; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.8–2.4;
ref. 36], whereas our shUSP9X-based gene signature did
(P ¼ 6.5 104; HR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.7–9.3; Supplementary Fig.
S5A and S5B, right). Signiﬁcance was reached with the Loi and
colleagues series (P ¼ 0.035; HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.5; Supplementary Fig. S5A, left; ref. 35), which was outperformed by our
shUSP9X-based gene signature using the same cohort, even
though the conﬁdence intervals did overlap (P ¼ 9.4  105;
HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9–5.2; Supplementary Fig. S5B, left).
Cumulatively, we found USP9X knockdown to induce tamoxifen resistance in cell lines, and could apply a downstream gene

signature to identify tamoxifen-treated patients with breast
cancer with a poor response to therapy.

Discussion
We identify here a role for USP9X in regulation of the
response to tamoxifen in ERa-positive breast cancer. USP9X
affects the stability and activity of numerous regulatory proteins that inﬂuence cell survival. Earlier publications had
attributed a prosurvival role to USP9X in B- and mantle cell
lymphomas, chronic myeloid leukemia, and multiple myeloma,
through stabilization of MCL1 (49). USP9X can also act as a
tumor suppressor and plays a role in oxidative stress–induced
cell death through ASK1 (apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1;
ref. 18). In addition, USP9X was identiﬁed as a tumor-suppressor gene in pancreatic cancer (50).
The ﬁndings presented here establish a novel role for
USP9X acting as a mediator of the response to tamoxifen in
ERa-positive breast cancer. USP9X knockdown stabilizes
ERa–chromatin interactions, enables tamoxifen-induced
ERa activation, and stimulates ERa-responsive cell proliferation in the presence of tamoxifen. A gene-expression
signature composed of tamoxifen-responsive genes in
shRNA USP9X cells can identify patients with breast cancer
with a poor response to tamoxifen treatment. The tumors
identiﬁed as tamoxifen-responsive through the USP9X signature are more often of the luminal A type, whereas the
group with the resistant signature shows enrichment for
luminal B-type tumors. Still our gene signature is not merely
providing a distinction on the basis of the molecular subtype, because approximately 30% of the tumors classiﬁed as
tamoxifen-resistant were luminal A and a comparable percentage of the tamoxifen-sensitive tumors were luminal B
type. This ﬁnding is potentially of clinical relevance, as the
data indicate that our gene signature can identify luminal Atype tumors that respond poorly to tamoxifen treatment
and might beneﬁt from alternative treatment regimes.
Importantly, USP9X knockdown did not induce fulvestrant
resistance, thus providing an alternative treatment option
for patients classiﬁed as tamoxifen-resistant through our
signature.
Although USP9X physically interacts with ERa, as was
shown before (43), we were not able to show any deubiquitinating activity of USP9X toward ERa. We hypothesize that the
role of USP9X in ERa signaling lies in regulating its interactions
with chromatin, potentially facilitating cofactor recruitment
and/or deubiquitination of such ERa cofactors.
The USP9X knockdown tamoxifen gene-expression signature we identify here enables the identiﬁcation of patients
with breast cancer with a poor response to adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Because USP9X knockdown directly affects
the biology of ERa, other modes of tamoxifen resistance
might be recapitulated by the same gene signature, broadening the potential applicability of our ﬁndings. Importantly, evaluation of USP9X levels alone did not enable such a
patient stratiﬁcation (data not shown). This is not an
unexpected ﬁnding given that USP9X has many cellular
functions, and the identiﬁcation of our distinct gene-

expression signature enabled us to exclusively study the
consequences of USP9X loss on ERa function and tamoxifen
response.
Our shUSP9X-based gene signature was generated on
tamoxifen-treated cells in vitro, and was subsequently applied
on gene-expression data from tumor samples obtained before
endocrine therapy. This demonstrated that the signature is
capable of identifying intrinsic tamoxifen resistance in vivo.
Future clinical studies on tumor specimens collected pre- and
post-neoadjuvant tamoxifen treatment are required to further
investigate directionality of the differentially expressed genes
before and after tamoxifen treatment in relation to treatment
response.
In summary, we report here an unexpected role for USP9X in
ERa-positive breast cancer, as USP9X loss induces tamoxifenstimulatory effects on ERa action, leading to tamoxifen resistance. Furthermore, we show that a USP9X knockdown tamoxifen gene expression signature can be used as a potential
biomarker to identify patients with ERa-positive breast cancer
with a poor outcome after tamoxifen treatment.
