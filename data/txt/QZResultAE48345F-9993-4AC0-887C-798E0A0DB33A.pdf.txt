BACKGROUND. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis. There is no standard therapy for CCA, and
novel drugs for treating refractory CCA need to be identified. METHODS. The authors hypothesized that, if a drug could reverse the
gene expression signature of CCA, then it may inhibit the carcinogenesis of CCA and, hence, would be a potential therapeutic agent.
Thus, the gene expression signatures from patients with CCA were queried using the bioinformatic method Connectivity Map, resulting in the enrichment of heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors with therapeutic potentials. RESULTS. Two HSP90 inhibitors, 17AAG (tanespimycin) and the synthetic diarylisoxazole amide resorcinol NVP-AUY922, demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity
in in vitro studies. In a thioacetamide-induced animal model, NVP-AUY922 also had antitumor activity and resulted in objective tumor
regression. In addition, NVP-AUY922 reduced the expression of client oncoproteins involved in CCA oncogenesis and inhibited downstream proteins of both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit a/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 protein
kinase (PIK3/AKT) pathway and the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene/mitogen-activated protein kinase (KRAS/MAPK)
pathway. CONCLUSIONS. Preclinical data from the current study suggest that NVP-AUY922 may be an effective treatment option for

INTRODUCTION
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant cancer arising from the neoplastic transformation of the cholangiocytes that
line the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.1,2 CCA is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy, and
recent epidemiologic studies suggest that the incidence and mortality rates of CCA, especially intrahepatic CCA, are
increasing worldwide.2-4 Most patients with CCA are diagnosed with advanced disease, and curative surgical resection is
possible but is sometimes difficult to perform.4,5 Several molecular-targeted therapies have been assessed in clinical trials
and produced limited median progression-free survival ranging from 1.8 months to 7 months.6,7 However, to date, there
is no standard therapy for refractory CCA, and identifying additional therapeutic drugs is urgently needed.
We previously demonstrated that, if a drug could at least partially reverse the gene expression signature of cancer
cells, then it also may inhibit cancer-related pathways and, thus, treat cancer. We used the gene signatures of hepatocellular
carcinoma and the Connectivity Map (CMap) tool8—a combination of computational and experimental studies—and
screened antipsychotic drugs that could be used for human hepatocellular carcinoma.9 The CMap project hosts approximately 6100 gene expression profiles using Affymetrix gene chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif) from cultured human
cancer cell lines treated with bioactive small molecules and provides pattern-matching algorithms to mine these data.9
This platform-independent system uses a nonparametric, rank-based algorithm to calculate a score that indicates the
degree of similarity or dissimilarity between query gene signatures and profile gene signatures. A strong negative connectivity score (dissimilarity) indicates that an agent reverses the expression of corresponding gene signatures. Thus, agents
with strong negative connectivity scores may allow a transition from a particular diseased state to a more phenotypically
normal state.9-13 This concept was applied in the current study to identify drugs that could reverse the gene expression

signature of CCA. We collected gene signatures of intrahepatic CCA, queried the CMap database with the signatures, and identified potential therapeutic drugs. Our
analysis identified heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors as 1 class of candidate agents.
The molecular chaperone HSP90 plays an important role in the post-translational maturation and activation of many critical oncogenic client proteins that are
essential for facilitating malignant transformation and
increasing the survival, growth, and invasive potential of
cancer cells.13,14 HSP90 inhibitors induce proteasomemediated degradation of these client proteins and, thus,
inhibit the growth and survival of cancer cells. Herein, we
demonstrate that 2 HSP90 inhibitors, 17-AAG (tanespimycin) and the synthetic diarylisoxazole amide resorcinol
NVP-AUY922, exhibit potent antitumor activity at tolerated doses in a CCA model. Our preclinical data provide
a rationale to conduct clinical trials with NVP-AUY922
in patients with CCA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Tumor Type Validation

We prospectively collected pathologically proven intrahepatic CCA specimens from 8 patients who had undergone
hepatectomy at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board (IRB 94-672B) at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. There were 4 men and 4 women, and the median
patient age was 56.7 years. The tumor types of all 8 CCA
samples were validated histologically by positive immunoreactivity to the biliary cytokeratin (CK) CK7/CK19
(Dako, Carpinteria, Calif) and negative immunoreactivity
to HepPar1 (Dako).
Microarray Analysis

We used 8 pairs of human CCA specimens and normal
specimens in expression arrays that were manufactured for
gene expression analysis by NimbleGen (Madison, Wis).
The gene expression signature was based on a comparison
between 8 pairs of tumor tissue and nontumor, normal
liver tissue from the same individual.15,16 The microarrays
were analyzed using GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, Calif) with the default settings. The robust
multichip average with default settings was used for normalization and summarization of the data. T tests for
paired data were conducted, and genes that had P values
< .01 were selected for further analysis.
Connectivity Map Analysis

The steps involved in CMap analysis are illustrated in Figure 1. Genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated
294

were entered into the CMap database. Only drugs that
had negative scores and P values < .05 were considered
for further study. The sum of drug occurrences was used
to rank the drugs.
Cell Lines

Two intrahepatic CCA cell lines were obtained from the
following sources: HuCCT1 (Japanese Collection of
Research Bioresources, Osaka, Japan) and CGCCA
(Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan).17,18 HuCCT1 and CGCCA cells were routinely
cultured in RPMI1640 and Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY), respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,
100 lg/mL streptomycin, 100 lg/mL penicillin, and 2
mM l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2 at 37 C.
Chemicals

The drug 17-allylamino-demethoxy geldanamycin (17AAG) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo). A stock
solution was prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and stored at 20 C. The drug was diluted in
fresh media before each experiment. NVP-AUY922 was
provided by Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). For in vitro
experiments, stock solutions of NVP-AUY922 were prepared in 100% DMSO (10 mM) and stored at 20 C.
For subcutaneous injections, the free base of NVPAUY922 was formulated in 60 mM lactic acid or 2.5%
ethanol, 20% 50 mM tartaric acid, and 77.5% of 5% glucose in water containing 1% Tween-80 (volume/volume).
An optimized NVP-AUY922 salt with high solubility in
aqueous solution was formulated in 5% glucose in water
for subcutaneous administration and delivered in a volume of 10 mL/kg.
Cell Cycle Analysis

Cells were plated on 6-well plates, incubated for 24 hours,
and then treated with DMSO, 17-AAG, or NVPAUY922. For flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized and
fixed in 70% ethanol at 20 C, washed, and incubated
with 10 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma) for 15 minutes at
37 C. Next, the cells were stained with 200 lg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Cells were evaluated using a FACSCalibur machine (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson) for
modeling cell cycle distribution. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are expressed as the mean 
standard deviation.

Tetrazolium Salt 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide Cell Viability
Assay

The viability of the exposed cells was determined using
the TACS tetrazolium salt 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assay kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, Md) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. MTT is used to determine cell viability in cell proliferation and cytotoxicity
assays. Briefly, the cells were seeded at a concentration of
1500 cells per well (HuCCT1 cells) or 900 cells per well
(CGCCA cells) in 50 lL of culture medium into 96-well
microplates. At 24 hours postseeding, the cells were
treated with DMSO, 17-AAG, or NVP-AUY922. The
cells were exposed to different concentrations of the drugs
for 72 hours. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in
medium containing MTT for 2 hours. The optical density
at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Spectral Max250; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif).
Western Blot Analysis

Whole cell lysates from CCA cell lines were obtained
using a Pierce radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill). Protein samples were

Animal Studies

All animal studies were approved by the experimental animal ethics committee of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. All investigations conformed to the US National
Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.19 Twelve adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
(weight, 310  14 g) were used in the experiments. Animals were equally divided into a control group and an experimental group. The rats were housed in an animal
room with a 12-hour:12-hour light-dark cycle (light from
08:00 AM to 08:00 PM) at an ambient temperature of 22 
1 C. Food and water were provided ad libitum. The rats
were administered 300 mg thioacetamide (TAA) in 1 L of
drinking water daily for up to 24 weeks. In the experimental group, NVP-AUY922 (12.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously)
was administered once daily 5 days per week over a 2week period; specifically, the from the 21st week to the
22nd week. Rats in the control group received a subcutaneous injection of buffer according to the same schedule.
Positron Emission Tomography

To evaluate the changes in glycolysis in live animals with
liver tumors, we conducted 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-Dglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)
studies in rats at the molecular imaging center of the
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. In total, 12 rats were
received TAA and were subjected to serial PET scanning
in weeks 20, 22, and 24 using the Inveon system (Siemens
Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Knoxville, Tenn). Equal
numbers of animals were assigned to the control and treatment groups according to the baseline PET findings. In
other words, the control and treatment groups possessed
similar PET-positive rates. The details of radioligand
preparation, scanning protocols, and the determination of
optimal scanning time have been described previously by
our group.20 Briefly, animals were fasted overnight before
the scan. At 90 minutes after intravenous FDG injection,
30-minute static scans were obtained for all animals. All
imaging studies were performed using a temperature-controlled (set to 37 C) and anesthesia gas-controlled (2%
isoflurane in 100% oxygen) imaging bed (Minerve System; Bioscan, Wash, DC). PET images were reconstructed using the 2-dimensional-ordered subset
expectation-maximization method (4 iterations and 16
subsets) without attenuation or scatter corrections. All
imaging data were processed using the PMOD imageanalysis workstation (PMOD Technologies Ltd., Zurich,
Switzerland). The largest liver tumor was identified by
careful investigation of all 3 image sets for each rat. FDG
uptake into the biggest liver tumor and into apparently
296

normal liver tissue was quantified by calculating the standardized uptake value (SUV) according to the following
formula:
SUV ¼

Decay corrected tissue activity ðBq=mLÞ
:
Injected dose ðBpÞ=Body weight ðgÞ

These values were calculated according to the recommendations of the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer.21 The tumor regions
of interest were determined using transverse images of the
selected tumors and measuring the greatest dimension.
Normal liver regions of interest also were determined
using the same transverse images. The mean SUV (SUVmean) of the normal liver and tumor tissue was determined,
and the tumor-to-liver radioactivity ratio was calculated
for comparison.
Statistical Analysis

Two-sided Student t tests were used for statistical comparisons. All P values < .05 were considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Gene Signatures of Cholangiocarcinoma and
Connectivity Map Analysis

A t test with a P value threshold of .01 was used to analyze
the microarray data. Based on this cutoff value, 58 upregulated genes and 47 down-regulated genes were identified. Because the CMap platform was based on Affymetrix
arrays, a conversion step was required to match the NimbleGen probe sets into their corresponding Affymetrix
U133A probe sets (Table 1). Probe sets with the same
gene symbol annotations from both platforms were considered correct matches. Of the genes that had altered
expression, 11 up-regulated genes and 2 down-regulated
genes had no matches to the U133A platform. Because a
gene may match to multiple Affymetrix probe sets, 47 upregulated genes and 45 down-regulated genes were
matched to 73 up-regulated probe sets and 73 down-regulated probe sets, respectively. The up-regulated and
down-regulated probe sets were queried against CMap,
and the results were filtered at P values < .05. The top 10
drugs identified by CMap analysis are listed in Table 2.
Three of the top 10 drugs, 17-AAG (tanespimycin), geldanamycin, and alvespimycin, are HSP90 inhibitors,
which suggested that HSP90 may be a good drug target
for CCA (Fig. 2). We wanted to further validate the antitumor effects of HSP90 inhibitors in CCA, and we chose

of NVP-AUY922 were 40 nM and 15 nM, respectively
(Fig. 3B). Cellular potency, as determined from the
mean IC50 values for the 2 cell lines tested, was higher
for NVP-AUY922 than for 17-AAG by a factor of 1.5 in
CGCCA cells and by a factor of 3.1 in HuCCT1 cells
(Fig. 3B).

Arrest and Apoptotic Cell Death in
Cholangiocarcinoma Cells

We further demonstrated G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in
17-AAG-treated and NVP-AUY922-treated CGCCA
cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, Cdc25C, a key regulator of
G2/M cell division, was down-regulated in drug-treated
CGCCA and HuCCT1 cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, 17AAG and NVP-AUY922 induced apoptosis in the cancer
cell lines. This was evident by the time-dependent and
dose-dependent increase in the sub-G1 population and
cleaved PARP (Fig. 4B-D). PARP cleavage resulted in the
simultaneous activation of the caspase pathway, as indicated by an increase in the levels of cleaved caspase 3
(Fig. 4D).

The data demonstrating HSP70 as a marker of the heatshock transcription factor-1–dependent stress response
are provided in Figure 5. When CGCCA and HuCCT1
cells were treated with 5 times the IC50 value of 17-AAG
or NVP-AUY922, an increase in the level of HSP70 was
detected after 8 hours of treatment. Western blot analyses
of various HSP90 client protein expression levels in
response to NVP-AUY922 and 17-AAG treatment over a
72-hour period in the CGCCA and HuCCT1 cell lines
are provided in Figure 5. Both drugs depleted levels of the
main growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in
CCA cell lines, including the EGFR, IGF1R, c-MET,
and c-KIT client proteins. In both cell lines, 17-AAG and
NVP-AUY922 decreased the level of p-IjBa, although it
is not a client protein.

The decreased expression of AKT and B-raf, 2 important
HSP90 client proteins, was observed after NVP-AUY922
and 17-AAG treatment over a 72-hour period, as indicated in Figure 5. Reduced AKT and B-raf levels resulted
in the simultaneous abrogation of phosphatidylinositol 3kinase catalytic subunit a (PIK3A)/AKT pathway activity
and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
(KRAS)/ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activity, as indicated by a decrease in p-AKT and pERK levels (Fig. 5).

NVP-AUY922 Induces Tumor Regression in a
Thioacetamide-Treated Animal Model

In an in vivo experiment, we evaluated transverse, sagittal,
and coronal PET scan views of tumor tissues from animals
with TAA-induced CCA. The control and experimental
rats had at least 1 FDG-avid tumor with increased SUV in
the liver after treatment with TAA. Representative PET
images are provided in Figure 6A,B. The tumor/liver (T/
L) SUV ratios in the control and NVP-AUY922-treated
groups at different time points after TAA treatment are
illustrated in Figure 6C. The mean T/L SUV ratio
remained high up to the 24th week in the control group.
The mean T/L SUVmean ratio was significantly lower at 2
weeks post-treatment with NVP-AUY922 than that
determined in the control animals (control vs NVPAUY922: 1.81  0.18 vs 1.40  0.17; P < .05). The
PET analysis results suggested that NVP-AUY922 treatment resulted in partial but significant suppression of tumor growth in a rat CCA model.
DISCUSSION
To identify new therapeutic options for the treatment of
CCA, we collected CCA-related genes to query CMap
and demonstrated that HSP90 inhibitors are potential
therapies for human CCA. The HSP90 inhibitors 17AAG and NVP-AUY922 have significant proapoptotic
and antiproliferative effects in CCA cell lines in vitro.
Moreover, NVP-AUY922 induces tumor regression in a
TAA-induced CCA animal model as determined by PET
analysis.
The need to identify new drugs for the treatment of
CCA while ensuring cost effectiveness encouraged us to
explore a drug-repurposing methodology. With bioinformatics analysis tools, we exploited CCA gene signatures
and CMap8 to define associations between gene perturbations, diseases, and drug activities. This allowed us to systematically identify several potential therapeutic drugs. It
is noteworthy that 3 of the 10 top ranking drugs, namely,
tanespimycin, geldanamycin, and alvespimycin, were
HSP90 inhibitors. This finding prompted us to investigate the role of HSP90 inhibitors in CCA. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate antitumor
activity of HSP90 inhibitors in CCA.
Knowledge of the pathogenesis of tumors and its inhibition can help identify cancer-targeting agents. On the
basis of this rationale, several cancer-targeting agents have
been identified; for example, human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-blocking antibodies in breast
cancer,22 EGFR monoclonal antibodies in KRAS wildtype colon cancer,23 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors

in lung cancer with EGFR mutations.24 For CCA, several
important tumor-associated pathways, including the
KRAS/MAPK, EGFR, HER2/NEU, and IGF/PIK3 pathways, have been identified.6,7 We observed that 17-AAG
and NVP-AUY922 depleted EGFR and IGF1R, the main
client proteins involved in CCA oncogenesis, and inhibited
downstream proteins in both the PI3K/AKT pathway and
the KRAS/MAPK pathway; treatment also efficiently
inhibited their downstream proteins, p-AKT and p-ERK.
Because CCA arises through the cumulative action of multiple oncogenic changes, it may acquire resistance to targeted therapies by activating compensatory pathways.
Therefore, 17-AAG and NVP-AUY922, which can inhibit
several client oncoproteins and their downstream pathways,
may be considered therapeutic agents in CCA.
The geldanamycin analog 17-AAG (tanespimycin)
and alvespimycin have exhibited tumor responses in some
phase 1/2 clinical trials,25,26 and they in are the same class
of HSP90 inhibitors. Thus, we have provided the results
from 17-AAG in this study for comparison. However,
these compounds have some limitations, including severe
adverse events, such as hepatotoxicity.26 17-AAG also is
difficult to produce, and there is only limited time

remaining before the drug’s patent expires. Thus, the
pharmaceutical company halted development of 17-AAG
in 2010. In our bioinformatic analysis (Figs. 1, 2), we
identified HSP90 as a potential target for CCA. To translate our findings into future clinical practice, for the current study, we chose another novel HSP90 inhibitor that
is currently in development: NVP-AUY922. The synthetic diarylisoxazole amide resorcinol, NVP-AUY922, is
1 of the most potent small-molecule HSP90 inhibitors.27
The IC50 of NVP-AUY922 was lower than that of 17AAG, indicating that NVP-AUY922 is more potent.
NVP-AUY922 demonstrated antiproliferative activity in
both CCA cell lines that we studied and also decreased the
level of p-IjBa (Fig. 5). This suggests that the antiproliferative activity of NVP-AUY922 may be caused by inhibition of the nuclear factor jB pathway.28 NVP-AUY922
also reportedly demonstrated antiproliferative activity
against other tumors in previous preclinical trials.29-31
We previously developed a TAA-induced CCA rat
model that recapitulated the histologic progression of
human CCA.18 The results indicated that TAA rat model
may serve as a useful preclinical tool for evaluating therapeutic strategies in invasive CCA.18

current study, PET images were acquired sequentially
using FDG to conduct a lesion-by-lesion comparison
between control and experimental groups to determine
treatment efficacy. Although the accuracy of detecting
tumors >2 mm is high, animal PET analyses may miss
approximately 35% of tumors <1 mm.20 Our animal
PET scanner could not detect CCA tumors that measured
<2 mm in size, and invasive CCA in the TAA rat model
was not easily distinguished from the normal liver background because of the lack of distinct borders. Therefore,
we used the average T/L ratio instead of the SUV of the
tumor tissue alone as a quantitative method to measure
tumor growth.20 We demonstrated a decrease in the mean
T/L ratio of the SUVmean in NVP-AUY922-treated rats.
In conclusion, our bioinformatics analysis predicted
that HSP90 inhibitors would be potential therapeutic
agents in CCA. NVP-AUY922 had potent antitumor activity in the low-nanomolar range against CCA cells. In
addition, NVP-AUY922 depleted the main client proteins involved in CCA oncogenesis and inhibited downstream proteins in the PI3K/AKT and KRAS/MAPK
pathways. Tumor regression was demonstrated in the
TAA-induced CCA animal model in rats that received
NVP-AUY922. These preclinical data provide a rationale
to conduct clinical trials with NVP-AUY922 in patients
with CCA.

Figure 6. (A,B) These transverse 2-deoxy-2-(F-18) fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans at the
tumor level reveal (A) tumor progression in control rats and (B)
tumor regression after treatment with NVP-AUY922 (12.5 mg/
kg). The image intensity was normalized to normal liver tissue
for comparison. The color scale represents the intensity of the
specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) of the tumor to normal liver
(arrowheads indicate cholangiocarcinomas). (C) Tumor regression is apparent in the third PET scan from the treatment group
(NVP-AUY922 12.5 mg/kg; n ¼ 6) compared with the scan from
the control group (n ¼ 6). Each point represents the mean 
standard deviation. L/T ratio indicates liver-to-tumor ratio.

In recent years, tumor response to therapeutic agents
has been detected by using a combination of direct tumor
measurements and molecular imaging methods, including
FDG-PET. We have demonstrated that micro-PET analysis for conducting imaging studies in small animals
allows for the noninvasive, quantitative, and repetitive
imaging of biologic functions in living animals.20 In the
