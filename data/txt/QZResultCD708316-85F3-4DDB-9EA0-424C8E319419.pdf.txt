Abstract

$watermark-text

Human lung adenocarcinomas with activating mutations in EGFR (epidermal growth factor
receptor) often respond to treatment with EGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs),butthe magnitude
of tumour regression is variable and transient1,2. This heterogeneity in treatment response could
result from genetic modifiers that regulate the degree to which tumour cells are dependent on
mutant EGFR. Through a pooled RNA interference screen, we show that knockdown of FAS and
several components of the NF-κB pathway specifically enhanced cell death induced by the EGFR
TKI erlotinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. Activation of NF-κB through overexpression of
c-FLIP or IKK (also known as CFLAR and IKBKB, respectively), or silencing of IκB (also
known as NFKBIA), rescued EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells from EGFR TKI treatment. Genetic
or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-κB enhanced erlotinib-induced apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive
and erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer models. Increased expression of the NF-κB
inhibitor IκB predicted for improved response and survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients
treated with EGFR TKI. These data identify NF-κB as a potential companion drug target, together
with EGFR, in EGFR-mutant lung cancers and provide insight into the mechanisms by which
tumour cells escape from oncogene dependence.

Despite marked clinical successes achieved with inhibitors of ‘driver’ kinases that promote
tumour growth, responses are rarely complete and also vary in duration3,4. We hypothesized
that the heterogeneity of treatment response may result from genetic modifiers that regulate
the degree to which tumour cells are dependent upon the driver kinase and the response to
TKI treatment.

$watermark-text

Using lung cancer as a model to identify such modifiers, we conducted a screen for genes
that, when silenced, enhance EGFR dependence in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines. We
intentionally selected H1650 cells for the primary screen because they are insensitive to
EGFR TKIs despite expressing a mutant EGFR with an exon 19 deletion (ex19del) that
predicts for erlotinib sensitivity in patients. H1650 cells harbour no known EGFR TKI
resistance mechanisms other than functional PTEN loss, which does not fully account for
their insensitivity5. To identify small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that might restore dependence
on mutant EGFR in H1650 cells, we introduced a pooled, shRNA library targeting >2,000
‘cancer-relevant’ genes6 (Supplementary Table 1) and treated these cells with vehicle or
erlotinib, a standard EGFR TKI used in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients. Hairpins
targeting 36 genes reproducibly conferred erlotinib sensitivity in H1650 cells across three
replicates (threshold 1.5-fold depletion in erlotinib/vehicle, P < 0.1; Supplementary Table 2).

Among the primary screen hits, 18 of the targeted genes, including FAS, could be directly or
indirectly linked to NF-κB signalling, which is known to have a role in survival signalling
(Supplementary Table 2). Because recent data demonstrated that FAS and NF-κB signalling
can promote tumour growth7–9, we proposed that FAS–NF-κB may rescue EGFR-mutant
tumour cells from EGFR inhibition. First, we confirmed that shRNAs targeting six of the
highest scoring NF-κB pathway-associated genes identified in the primary pooled screen
effectively silenced expression of their targets in H1650 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Then
we validated their growth inhibitory effects in erlotinib-treated H1650 cells using
independent siRNAs (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1b). Importantly, this reduction in cell
viability was associated with increased caspase 3/7 activity (Fig. 1b), indicating that
knockdown of these genes promoted erlotinib-induced apoptosis. To address directly the
role of the NF-κB pathway in EGFR TKI sensitivity, we knocked down the major NF-κB
subunit RELA (not represented in the pooled library) and found that RELA knockdown also
induced erlotinib sensitivity in H1650 cells using short term viability and apoptosis readouts
as well as clonogenic assays (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2). Furthermore, this
sensitizing effect was specific to EGFR inhibition because stable RELA knockdown did not
alter sensitivity to cisplatin, paclitaxel or ultraviolet treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2) or
other TKI (imatinib) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Because c-FLIP and RIPK have been
implicated as intermediate signalling proteins linking FAS to NF-κB10, we asked if these
genes also regulate erlotinib sensitivity. Indeed, silencing of c-FLIP or RIPK induced
erlotinib sensitivity in H1650 cells (Fig. 1a, b). The effects of the entire panel of siRNAs
targeting nine different NF-κB pathway-associated genes were observed regardless of PTEN
status (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b).
Next we asked whether the NF-κB pathway genes that scored in H1650 cells show similar
effects in other EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines. Whereas H1650 cells express
EGFRex19del, 11-18 human lung cancer cells express EGFR(L858R) yet are also relatively
insensitive to erlotinib without a resistance mechanism validated in patients11. Each of the
siRNAs that scored in H1650 cells also scored in cell viability and survival assays in 11-18
cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). Silencing of the same set of genes also enhanced the
growth suppressive effects of erlotinib in HCC827 cells (expressing EGFRex19del) and in
H3255 cells (expressing EGFR(L858R)), both of which are relatively more sensitive to
EGFR TKIs (Supplementary Fig. 4e–h).

Because unknown alterations in human lung cancer cells could also influence erlotinib
sensitivity, we used an isogenic system of EGFR-transduced human bronchial epithelial
cells (HBEC) to test whether silencing of these genes cooperates with mutant EGFR to
induce oncogene dependence. Consistent with prior data12, human bronchial epithelial cells
(HBEC)-EGFR(L858R) and HBEC-EGFRex19del cells were not sensitive to erlotinib (100
nM). However, silencing of each of the nine genes studied in the lung cancer cell lines also
induced erlotinib sensitivity in HBEC-EGFRex19del (Fig. 1c) and HBEC-EGFR(L858R)
cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). Induction of erlotinib sensitivity seemed equivalent across
both the exon19del and L858R EGFR genotypes. The erlotinib-sensitizing effect of
silencing these genes was specific to mutant EGFR because no potentiating effect was seen
in wild-type HBEC-EGFRWT cells (Fig. 1d).
Because FAS knockdown promoted erlotinib-induced apoptosis, we measured the activation
state of three signalling pathways linked to cell survival (AKT, ERK, also known as
MAPK1, and NF-κB) to determine which, if any, was associated with erlotinib-induced cell
death. In erlotinib-sensitive HCC827 cells, erlotinib treatment alone led to reduced levels of
phosphorylated pAKT, pERK and pRELA (a measure of NF-κB activity), regardless of FAS
expression (Supplementary Fig. 6). But in erlotinib-resistant H1650 cells, these effects of
erlotinib were only observed when FAS was silenced (Supplementary Fig. 6). In HBECEGFR(L858R) cells, erlotinib suppressed AKT and ERK activation regardless of FAS
expression, but RELA phosphorylation was abolished only upon FAS silencing
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Together these data implicate persistent NF-κB signalling in
resistance to erlotinib-induced cell death.

$watermark-text

NF-κB signalling was recently shown to be essential for KRAS-driven tumour growth13.
Oncogenic KRAS and EGFR may drive tumour growth through a common signalling
pathway. Because in our studies NF-κB knockdown alone was not lethal in EGFR-mutant
lung cancer cell lines (HCC827, H3255), we compared the effect of silencing NF-κB in
HBEC-KRAS12V cells versus HBEC-EGFR(L858R) cells directly. Knockdown of RELA
alone impaired the growth of HBEC-KRAS12V but not HBEC-EGFR(L858R) cells
(Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that mutant EGFR does not function identically to mutant
KRAS in this model.

$watermark-text

To extend our findings to in vivo models, we used shRNAs targeting FAS, RELA or c-FLIP
(distinct from the primary screen) to achieve stable knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 8) of
the cognate protein in erlotinib-resistant H1650 cells. Silencing of each gene by stable
shRNA enhanced erlotinib sensitivity, with a 1–2 log-fold decrease in IC50 (half maximal
inhibitory concentration; Fig. 2a) and induction of apoptosis as measured by PARP cleavage
(Fig. 2b). Similar results were observed in 11-18 and HBEC-EGFR(L858R) cells
(Supplementary Fig. 9). We found that erlotinib treatment induced tumour regression and
apoptosis only upon knockdown of FAS or RELA (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 10a,
b) in H1650 human xenograft tumours.
We next asked whether activation of NF-κB might be sufficient to confer erlotinib
resistance in EGFR-mutant tumours. Canonical NF-κB signalling requires downregulation
of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB14. Therefore we predicted that decreased IκB levels, leading to
increased NF-κB signalling, might promote EGFR TKI resistance. First, we noted that IκB
expression was lower in three erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines that are
resistant to erlotinib compared with three sensitive cell lines (Fig. 3a and Supplementary
Fig. 11). Furthermore, we found that knockdown of IκB increased NF-κB phosphorylation
(Fig. 3b) and conferred partial resistance to erlotinib in HCC827 cells in vitro (Fig. 3c) and
in vivo (Fig. 3d–f). These effects were specific to EGFR inhibition because stable
knockdown of IκB did not protect HCC827 cells from cisplatin, paclitaxel or ultraviolet

treatment, as measured by clonogenic assays (Supplementary Fig. 12). c-FLIP has been
implicated as an intermediate signalling molecule that activates NF-κB downstream of
FAS10. Ectopic expression of c-FLIP induced persistent phosphorylation of RELA and
resistance to erlotinib in HCC827 cells (Supplementary Fig. 13). Together these data suggest
that NF-κB activation can rescue EGFR-mutant tumour cells from EGFR TKI.

$watermark-text

Acquired resistance to erlotinib in patients can occur through second site, drug-resistant
mutations in EGFR or through amplification of the MET kinase15,16. These same resistance
mechanisms can also evolve in vitro with prolonged growth in EGFR TKI17,18. We
therefore asked if NF-κB activation occurs naturally during the derivation of erlotinibresistant HCC827 cells through prolonged and continuous EGFR TKI treatment. In parental
HCC827 cells acute erlotinib treatment (100 nM, 24 h) inhibited EGFR, MET, AKT, ERK
and RELA phosphorylation. Continuous erlotinib treatment resulted in the outgrowth of
eight resistant HCC827 subclones (over >8 weeks) in which EGFR phosphorylation
remained inhibited by erlotinib. Consistent with prior data18, we observed compensatory
upregulation of phosphorylated MET in four erlotinib-resistant subclones. We also observed
increased FAS expression in the absence of MET upregulation in four additional subclones.
Increased RELA phosphorylation and decreased IκB expression were observed in three out
of four sub-clones in which FAS was upregulated (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Knockdown of
FAS in those subclones with FAS upregulation decreased pRELA and enhanced erlotinib
sensitivity, but did not result in decreased pAKT or pERK (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c).
Thus, FAS-mediated EGFR TKI resistance is distinct from MET-mediated EGFR TKI
resistance, which occurs primarily through reactivation of pERK and pAKT in HCC827
cells18. Our results are consistent with recent data establishing both MEK-dependent19 and
MEK-independent20 mechanisms of resistance of BRAF-mutant melanomas to the BRAF
inhibitor PLX4032.

$watermark-text

NF-κB pathway inhibition can be achieved through inhibition of IκB kinase (IKKβ, also
known as IKBKB), the primary kinase that promotes IκB instability leading to NF-κB
activation14. We therefore asked if pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of IKKβ enhances
erlotinib sensitivity in our erlotinib-resistant lung cancer models. Treatment of H1650 (Fig.
4a) or HBEC-EGFR(L858R) cells (Supplementary Fig. 15a, b) with the IKKβ inhibitor
BMS-345541 (ref. 21) inhibited RELA phosphorylation and restored erlotinib sensitivity.
Because BMS-345541 has suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties we used an shRNA to
knock down IKKβ in H1650 cells. The resulting H1650 cells, or those transduced with a
non-target control shRNA, were then grown as xenograft tumours and treated with either
vehicle or erlotinib. IKKβ knockdown resulted in increased levels of IκB and decreased NFκB phosphorylation, as expected. Erlotinib treatment induced tumour regression and
apoptosis only upon knockdown of IKKβ in this system (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig.
15c, d).
To determine the clinical relevance of our findings, we examined the status of NF-κB
activation in a cohort of 52 patients (part of a previously characterized cohort22) with EGFR
mutant lung cancer who were treated with erlotinib and did not have evidence of the T790M
mutation as a potential cause of erlotinib resistance. Because reduced IκB levels were
associated with erlotinib resistance in cell lines and tumour models, we asked if IκB
expression correlated with EGFR TKI response in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers.
Low IκB expression (‘high-NF-κB’ activation state) was predictive of worse progressionfree survival (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 4a) and decreased overall survival
(Supplementary Fig. 16a and Supplementary Table 4b). This finding was specific to
erlotinib because IκB expression did not predict outcome in a previouslycharacterized
cohort23 of 43 EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients that were not treated with EGFR TKIs but
instead with chemotherapy and surgery (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 16b). We also

observed a significant positive correlation between FAS expression and RELA, c-FLIP and
IκB levels in the erlotinib-treated patients (Supplementary Table 5). Together, our findings
suggest that the extent to which EGFR-mutant tumour cells engage the NF-κB pathway
may, in part, explain the non-uniform response to EGFR TKI treatment observed in EGFRmutant lung cancer patients and provide rationale for testing an IKK inhibitor in
combination with an EGFR TKI in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients.

METHODS SUMMARY
Compounds and cell culture

$watermark-text

H1650, 11-18, H3255, HCC827 cells were provided by W. Pao and were grown in RPMI
supplemented with 10% FBS. H1650 PTEN-reconstituted cells have been described
previously5. HBEC cell lines were provided by J. Minna and grown in K-SFM. Erlotinib
was from LC Labs. BMS-354541 was from Sigma-Aldrich.
Antibodies and immunoblots
All antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies and used at 1:1,000 dilution
according to manufacturer's instructions. Lysates from cell lines and xenograft tumours were
generated using standard methods and RIPA buffer and assayed by immunoblots.
Pooled shRNA screen

$watermark-text

H1650 cells were infected with 6,783 shRNAs targeting ~2,500 cancer-associated genes in a
pooled format. Abundance of each hairpin within the total population over time was
detected by hybridization to custom Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays with half-hairpin
and barcode probes corresponding to each shRNA6. The abundance difference for the
erlotinib-synthetic screen was determined as the average of the log2 signal from erlotinib
treated cells at later time points (day 10 and day 21) minus the average of this log2 signal
from vehicle treated cells at the later time points (day 10 and day 21). Significant hits were
defined as those altered by 1.5 fold, P < 0.1.
RNA interference assays

$watermark-text

Sequences for individual small interfering RNA (siRNA) or shRNA (from Sigma or Open
Biosystems) are shown in Supplementary Table 3. For siRNA experiments, cells were
treated in triplicate according to manufacturer's protocol. For shRNA experiments, cells
were spin-infected with shRNA virus. Where indicated cells were treated with vehicle or
erlotinib 24 h after RNAi treatment. Gene silencing was confirmed by mRNA isolation and
gene-specific quantitative RT PCR and by immunoblots. Cell viability or survival was
measured using CellTiter-Glo and Caspase-Glo, respectively, 24–96 h after drug treatment
according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to cells with a non-target siRNA
pool or shRNA hairpin.

mg erlotinib per kg per day or vehicle. Data are expressed as in Fig. 2c (+ s.e.m.). c, d,
Effects of IκkB expression on progression free survival in patients with EGFR-mutant lung
cancers (c) treated with single agent EGFR TKI (n = 52) or (d) chemotherapy and surgery (n
= 43). Clinical characteristics and responses were defined previously22. Median progressionfree survival and overall survival for the entire EGFR TKI-treated cohort were 20 months
(95% confidence interval, 13–26.9) and 33 months (95% confidence interval, 22.2–43.8),
respectively.
