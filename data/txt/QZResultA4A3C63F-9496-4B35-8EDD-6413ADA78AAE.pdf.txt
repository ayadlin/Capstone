Treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represent a success story in molecular medicine. The development of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
targeted against the causative Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in CML, has resulted in hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in all phases of CML. A significant proportion

of patients are resistant to imatinib or develop resistance during treatment. This
is often a result of mutated forms of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein to which imatinib
is unable to bind. Several strategies have been developed to overcome the problem of imatinib resistance, including high-dose imatinib, novel targeted agents,
and combination treatments. Novel agents include dasatinib, a potent TKI that
inhibits several critical oncogenic proteins and which has recently been approved
for patients with CML who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib; and nilotinib, a
potent selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor currently in clinical development. Other
agents in development include SKI-606 and INNO-406. Stem cell transplantation
remains a useful option, although it is not generally used as first-line treatment.
Overall, there are an increasing number of treatment options available for
patients with CML. Cancer 2007;109:2171–81.  2007 American Cancer Society.

hronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is one of the most extensively
studied and, arguably, best understood neoplasms.1–4 Approximately 4500 new cases of CML are diagnosed in the U.S. each year,
accounting for 13% of all leukemia diagnoses.5 The cytogenetic hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), created by a
reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9;22]
[q34;q11]). The conjugation of the breakpoint cluster region gene on
chromosome 22 and the Abelson kinase gene on chromosome 9 creates the BCR-ABL oncogene, which codes for a deregulated tyrosine
kinase. Bcr-Abl activates multiple signal transduction pathways,
including Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, STAT5/Janus kinase, and Myc. Bcr-Abl
activity leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, resulting in the malignant expansion of pluripotent stem cells in
bone marrow.
CML normally progresses through 3 clinically recognized
phases. Approximately 90% of patients are diagnosed during the
typically indolent chronic phase (CP), which is followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and a terminal blastic phase (BP). Although progression through all stages is most common, 20% to 25% of patients
progress directly from CP to BP. The time course for progression can
also be extremely varied. The mechanisms behind CML disease progression are not fully understood. As patients progress through the
different phases, cytogenetic abnormalities may be detected in addi-

tion to the Ph chromosome (termed clonal evolution).
Mutations and deletions in specific genes may also
occur (eg, p53, p16/INK4a, and RB). Increasing evidence suggests that Src family kinases may be
involved in CML disease progression through the
induction of cytokine independence and apoptotic
protection.6–8
Historically, CML was treated with conventional
busulfan or hydroxyurea chemotherapy and was
associated with a poor prognosis.3,9 Although these
agents controlled hematologic manifestations of the
disease, they did not delay disease progression.
Treatment with interferon-a (IFN-a) represented a
significant advance, producing hematologic and
cytogenetic responses in patients with CP CML, and
improving survival compared with previous treatments (5-year survival rate of 57% for IFN-a compared with 42% for chemotherapy; P < .00001).10
Combining cytarabine (a DNA synthesis inhibitor)
with IFN-a was found to produce additional benefits.11,12 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(SCT) also remains a useful treatment for some
patients. The current first-line therapy for CML is
imatinib.

Imatinib Mesylate
Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec1/Glivec1; Novartis,
Basel, Switzerland) is an orally available, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), and was the first
therapy designed to selectively target the causative
BCR-ABL oncogene in CML.13 Imatinib also inhibits
other signaling proteins, including platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and Kit,14 but not
other tyrosine kinases such as Src family kinases.
Imatinib acts by binding to the inactive form of BcrAbl, preventing a conformational switch to the active
form of the oncoprotein, and also by partially

occluding the enzyme’s ATP binding site (Fig. 1). This
prevents Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation, interfering
with its activation and blocking signal transduction.
The efficacy of imatinib was demonstrated in the
Phase III IRIS (International Randomized Study of
Interferon and STI571) trial, in which imatinib given
at a dose of 400 mg daily was compared with the
combination of IFN-a and cytarabine (a previous
treatment option) in patients with newly diagnosed
CP CML (n ¼ 1106).15 After a median follow-up of
19 months, imatinib was found to be significantly
better than the IFN-a–based treatment, as shown by
rates of complete hematologic response (CHR) (95%
vs 56%; P < .001) and major cytogenetic response
(MCyR)(35% Ph-positive [Ph1] cells in metaphase;
85% vs 22% [P < .001]) (see Table 1 for definitions).
Major molecular response (MMR) rates and progression-free survival were also found to be superior
with imatinib.15,16 Best responses after 5 years of follow-up are shown in Table 2.17 Adverse events (AEs)
associated with imatinib were generally mild or moderate, and included superficial edema, nausea, muscle cramps, and rashes (according to the common
terminology criteria rare version 3.0). Grade 3–4
events were uncommon except for neutropenia
(14%) and thrombocytopenia (8%).15 Recently, imatinib was reported to be associated with cardiotoxicity
and congestive heart failure,18 although this appears
to be uncommon in clinical practice.19

Imatinib resistance
Some patients are intrinsically resistant to imatinib
(primary resistance), and others may acquire resistance during treatment (secondary resistance [ie, imatinib treatment benefit is lost after an initial response]).3
Imatinib resistance is defined using several clinical,
hematologic, or molecular criteria (Table 3). Both

intrinsic and acquired resistance are more common
in patients with advanced phases of disease. In a
study of 300 patients followed for 4.5 years from a
single center, the percentages of patients in CP, AP, or
myeloid BP failing to achieve a CHR after initial imatinib treatment (intrinsic resistance) were 3%, 9%,
and 51%, respectively. The percentages of patients
experiencing hematologic recurrence after an initial
response (acquired resistance) were 22%, 32%, and
41%, respectively.20
The recent update from the IRIS study provides
a separate indication of imatinib resistance.17 After 5
years, 31% of patients (171 of 553 patients) initially
receiving imatinib had discontinued first-line treatment (including 4% for AEs, 11% for unsatisfactory
therapeutic effect, and 2.5% to cross over to IFN-a
treatment). When best observed response rates in
patients remaining on treatment are incorporated
(97% CHR rate and 89% MCyR rate), approximately

33% of imatinib-treated patients had not achieved a
CHR and 39% had not achieved a MCyR.
Various mechanisms may contribute to imatinib
resistance, including increased expression of Bcr-Abl
kinase through gene amplification, decreased intracellular imatinib concentrations caused by drug
efflux proteins, imatinib binding by plasma proteins,
and clonal evolution.3 In addition, Lyn and Hck are
overexpressed in some imatinib-resistant patient isolates and cell lines, suggesting that Src family kinases
may be involved in Bcr-Abl independence and progression to imatinib resistance.6–8 However, approximately 35% to 45% of cases of imatinib resistance
arise because of mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase
domains.20,21 Clinically relevant BCR-ABL mutations
disrupt critical contact points between imatinib and
the Bcr-Abl protein or induce structural alternations
that prevent imatinib binding, often by inducing a
transition from the inactive to the active conformation of the protein, to which imatinib is unable to
bind.3,22 With continued imatinib treatment, resistant
mutants are selected that eventually outgrow drugsensitive leukemic cells. The number of different
BCR-ABL mutations identified has steadily increased.22 Clusters of mutations have been described
in several areas of the Bcr-Abl molecule, including
the ATP binding site (P-loop), imatinib binding site,
activation loop (controlling kinase activation), and catalytic domain. Some Bcr-Abl mutations result in a
highly resistant phenotype in vitro; others remain relatively sensitive, meaning that resistance can be overcome by increasing the imatinib dose. Higher rates
of mutations are detected with increasing transcript
levels (eg, 2–5 fold), failure to achieve a MCyR, and
more advanced disease.23,24 Mutations in the P-loop

may be associated with a poor prognosis,23,25,26
although this was not confirmed in a separate analysis.24

High-dose imatinib
Imatinib dose escalation is an accepted clinical strategy for overcoming resistance. In patients with resistance or disease recurrence after imatinib at a dose of
300 or 400 mg/day, doubling the dose achieved hematologic or cytogenetic responses in greater than
half of patients.27 An improved level of efficacy was
achieved with higher starting doses (600 or 800 mg/
day) in Phase II trials of patients with AP or BP
CML.28,29 High-dose (HD) imatinib (800 mg/day) has
been evaluated as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed CP CML patients. Responses in 175 patients
(with a median follow-up of 30 months) were compared with historical controls (n ¼ 50) receiving
standard-dose (SD) imatinib (median follow-up of 53
months).30,31 Overall, 90% of HD-treated patients
achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR)
compared with 78% of those receiving SD imatinib
(P ¼ .03). The MMR rate at 12 months was 54% versus 24% with SD, respectively (P ¼ .001), and complete molecular remission rates (undetectable levels
of BCR-ABL transcripts) at 24 months were 27% and
10%, respectively. Some investigators have questioned the durability of responses after imatinib dose
escalation.32,33 As discussed above, dose escalation is
likely to be useful only in a subset of patients with
imatinib resistance (cytogenetic relapse). Alternative
treatment options are required for other patients.
New and Emerging Targeted Agents for CML
Several novel CML therapies have been designed to
inhibit wild-type and mutant forms of Bcr-Abl and
other molecular targets. One agent (dasatinib) has
been approved for clinical use, and others (eg, niloti-

nib/AMN107) are likely to follow. These novel agents
are now discussed.

Dasatinib
Dasatinib (SPRYCEL1; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New
York, NY) has recently been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with CP, AP, or myeloid or lymphoid
BP CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. Dasatinib is also indicated
for the treatment of adults with Ph1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia with resistance or intolerance to
prior therapy. Dasatinib is a novel, orally available,
multitargeted, potent TKI that inhibits several critical
oncogenic proteins, including Bcr-Abl, Src family of
kinases, Kit, PDGFR, and ephrin A receptor kinase.34–37
The structure of dasatinib is based on a different
chemical scaffold to imatinib. Dasatinib has a 325fold greater potency than imatinib for wild-type BcrAbl38 and, unlike imatinib, binds both the inactive
and active conformations of the protein (Fig. 1).39
Dasatinib effectively inhibits all imatinib-resistant kinase domain mutations tested, with the exception of
T315I.38,40 Src family kinase inhibition in Bcr-Ablexpressing cells induces growth arrest and apoptosis,41,42 suggesting that the wider target range of
dasatinib has the potential to provide additional
treatment benefits compared with more specific
agents.
Unlike imatinib, dasatinib is not a substrate of
multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1), an efflux
protein expressed on normal and leukemic hematopoietic stem cells.43,44 Efflux proteins might prevent
adequate intracellular concentrations of imatinib
being reached and may partly explain imatinib
insensitivity.45 Dasatinib may target an earlier progenitor population than imatinib in CML patient isolates, although the most primitive quiescent cells
may be inherently resistant to both drugs.46

Double-arm randomized trial.

Dasatinib has been clinically assessed in 1 dosefinding study and 5 subsequent studies involving
greater than 900 imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant patients (the START program). Phase I data
suggested that dasatinib was associated with a high
level of efficacy and durability.47 Results from the
START program demonstrated that treatment with
dasatinib at a dose of 70 mg twice daily resulted in
hematologic and cytogenetic responses across all
phases of CML in both imatinib-intolerant and imatinib-resistant patients (Table 4).48–52 In particular,
dasatinib was associated with molecular responses in
patients with imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML and
multiple Bcr-Abl mutations.53 Response rates were
similar regardless of whether patients had Bcr-Abl
mutations within the kinase domain.
Because dasatinib has higher potency than imatinib in vitro, it is of interest to compare this agent
with HD imatinib treatment. This was the purpose of
START-R, a randomized Phase II trial in patients with
CP CML and treatment failure after SD imatinib
(400–600 mg daily). Patients were randomized 2:1 to
receive either oral dasatinib at a dose of 70 mg twice
daily or imatinib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily
(n ¼ 150 patients). Data from a median follow-up of
15 months demonstrated that dasatinib was associated with higher response rates than HD imatinib.52 A MCyR was achieved in 52% of patients
treated with dasatinib versus 33% of imatinib-treated
patients and a CHR was observed in 93% versus 82%
of patients, respectively. In particular, a CCyR was
achieved in 40% versus 16% of patients, respectively,
indicating a greater depth of response for dasatinib
compared with HD imatinib. In patients with no

2175

prior cytogenetic response to imatinib therapy,
MCyRs occurred in 49% of dasatinib-treated patients
compared with 7% of those receiving HD imatinib.
There was a higher rate of myelosuppression and
pleural effusion with dasatinib. These data suggest
that dasatinib has the potential to delay disease progression to a greater extent than HD imatinib.
Throughout the START program, dasatinib was
generally well tolerated, with drug-related serious AEs
normally resolving after dose reduction or interruption.48–52 Imatinib-intolerant patients remained on
dasatinib longer than imatinib-resistant patients and
did not experience Grade 3–4 cross-intolerance. Grade
3–4 thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia occurred in
nearly 50% of patients. Nonhematologic AEs were generally mild to moderate. Pleural effusions were
observed in 5% to 35% of dasatinib-treated patients
(severe in 3–15% of patients), although the highest
incidence was noted in patients in advanced phases of
CML. With early recognition and appropriate measures (dose adjustments, steroids, and diuretics), pleural effusions can be effectively controlled.

Nilotinib
Nilotinib (AMN107, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is
an orally administered derivative of imatinib currently in clinical development that inhibits Bcr-Abl
with a 30- to 50-fold greater potency than imatinib.38
Similar to imatinib, nilotinib binds Bcr-Abl in its
inactive conformation only. Nilotinib has demonstrated activity against nearly all Bcr-Abl mutants
tested, although similar to dasatinib (and imatinib),
nilotinib is unable to inhibit the T315I mutation.
Nilotinib also inhibits PDGFR and Kit, but unlike
dasatinib, it does not inhibit Src family of kinases.
In a Phase I dose escalation study (n ¼ 119
patients), nilotinib demonstrated activity in patients
with imatinib-resistant CML.54 Nilotinib has also
been examined in 3 ongoing Phase II studies in
patients with CML and imatinib resistance or intolerance, and data are currently available from 326
patients who received nilotinib at a dose of 400mg
twice daily.55–57 The clinical activity of nilotinib was
observed in all phases of CML; CHRs were recorded
in 74%, 25%, and 13%, respectively, of patients with
CP, AP, and BP disease (Table 5). MCyRs were
recorded in 52% and 36% of CP and AP patients,
respectively. CHRs were observed in 6% of patients
with recurrent/refractory Ph1 acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL).
Overall, nilotinib treatment was associated with
a very favorable safety and tolerability profile. Frequently reported AEs in Phase I and II studies were
myelosuppression (Grade 3–4 in 10–20% of patients),

mild-to-moderate rashes, pruritus, nausea, and peripheral edema.54–57

Other targeted therapies in development
Several other Bcr-Abl inhibitors are currently in preclinical or early clinical development (Table 6).58–68
Similar to dasatinib, several of these agents have activity against both Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases,
and therefore have the potential for greater clinical
activity in CML. Two novel agents, bosutinib (SKI606) and INNO-406 (NS-187), have reached Phase I–
II trials. None of the agents discussed thus far are capable of inhibiting the T315I mutant of Bcr-Abl.
However, MK-0457 (previously VX-680), an ATP-competitive small molecule discovered as an aurora kinase inhibitor, inhibits Bcr-Abl kinase activity and
in vitro proliferation of cells expressing T315I.67 A
recent study has demonstrated clinical responses to
MK-0457 in 3 patients carrying the T315I mutation.68
ON012380, a non-ATP-targeted agent, has also shown
activity against imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants,
including T315I, both in vitro and in vivo.58
Targeting pathways downstream of Bcr-Abl may
provide an alternative therapeutic strategy in CML.

The Ras signaling pathway is downstream of Bcr-Abl
in CML cells, and inhibition of farnesyl transferase
activity blocks Ras activation.2,69 Two orally administered
farnesyl transferase inhibitors, lonafarnib (SCH66336)
and tipifarnib (R115777), have been associated with
hematologic and cytogenetic responses in pilot studies in CML.70–72

Combination strategies
Another approach for treating CML is to combine
imatinib with a different agent, including other targeted therapies. In vitro studies have shown combination with the Bcr-Abl/Src inhibitors dasatinib or
AP23464 enhanced imatinib’s activity for inhibiting
phosphorylation of wild-type Bcr-Abl. In addition,
imatinib did not appear to interfere with the inhibition of resistant Bcr-Abl mutants, although no effect
was observed on T315I.73 In early clinical studies in
patients with CML and imatinib treatment failure,
combined treatment with imatinib and either lonafarnib or tipifarnib was associated with hematologic
and cytogenetic responses in all 3 phases of CML
disease.74 It is interesting to note that lonafarnib
reduces the imatinib resistance of primitive quiescent CML cells, which may result in part from the
ability of lonafarnib to inhibit the MDR1 efflux pump
found in leukemic stem cells.75 Combination strategies involving imatinib and other agents currently
are under investigation, including homoharringtonine (a plant alkaloid that inhibits protein synthesis
and induces apoptosis), decitabine (a hypomethylating agent), and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (a
histone deacetylase inhibitor).74,76
Stem Cell Transplantation
Because of the success of Bcr-Abl inhibitors, allogeneic SCT has changed from being a preferred firstline therapy to a second-line or third-line option. Despite this, SCT remains an important treatment that
offers the potential for cure, although this needs to be

balanced with the possible risks, which include mortality, graft-versus-host disease, life-threatening infections, and the risk of secondary malignancy.77 Prior
imatinib treatment does not appear to adversely affect
SCT.78 Recent reports provide the best estimates of
current outcomes after SCT. Data were analyzed from
131 CP CML patients undergoing SCT (bone marrow
or peripheral blood) from related donors at a single
institution in the U.S. between 1995 and 2000.79 The
estimated probability of disease-free survival at 3
years was 78%, with survival and disease recurrence
rates estimated at 86% and 8%, respectively. The
Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the European
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)
has recently provided updated data.80 Among all European patients undergoing SCT for CML between
2000 and 2003 (n ¼ 3018), the 2-year survival rate was
61%, the transplant-related mortality rate was 30%,
and the rate of disease recurrence was 22%. However,
better outcomes were observed in patients who
underwent SCT at the time of first CP from a human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling (2-year survival rate of 74%, transplant-related mortality rate of
22%, and disease recurrence rate of 18%). These data
illustrate that outcome after SCT is highly dependent
on defined risk factors. In the EBMT study, favorable
risk factors were sibling donor, treatment at an early
stage of disease, younger recipient age (age < 20 years
vs ages 20–40 years vs age > 40 years); and < 12
months from the time of diagnosis to SCT.80,81 If successful, SCT can have long-term results. In a 10-year
study of patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow
from siblings (46 in first CP, and 43 in advanced
phases), the mean time to hematologic or cytogenetic
disease recurrence was 7.7 years and 46% of the longterm survivors (13 of 28 patients) never developed
disease recurrence.82
Because as many as two-thirds of patients do
not have a suitable HLA-matched sibling, SCT from
unrelated HLA-matched donors has been examined.
One study compared results from 2464 unrelated donor bone marrow transplantations with 450 HLAidentical sibling donor transplantations performed at
National Marrow Donor Program institutions in the
U.S. between 1988 and 1999.83 In the unrelated donor group, 63% were matched at HLA-A, HLA-B, and
HLA-DRB1 alleles. Multivariate analysis demonstrated
a significantly increased risk of graft failure and acute
graft-versus-host disease after transplantation from an
unrelated donor compared with a related donor, and
survival and disease-free survival were found to be
significantly worse for patients who received SCT
from unrelated donors. However, for patients with CP
CML undergoing transplantation within 1 year from

2177

diagnosis, the 5-year disease-free survival rate was
similar or only slightly inferior.

Immunotherapy for CML
Targeting CML with vaccines is an attractive option to
potentially eradicate minimal residual disease, and
several approaches are currently in early clinical development. The junction between the fused BCR and
ABL genes in CML creates a novel peptide sequence
that is unique to leukemic cells. In 2 trials of junction
peptide-based vaccination, peptide-specific T-cell
responses and clinical responses were observed,
including improved cytogenetic responses and transient undetectable levels of BCR-ABL transcripts.84,85
Vaccination with autologous tumor-derived heat
shock proteins, which are immunogenic and likely to
contain tumor-specific peptides, also has resulted in
improved cytogenetic or molecular responses in some
patients.86,87 Clinical effects have been associated
with other immunotherapy strategies, including vaccination with the PR1 peptide derived from proteinase
3,88 and a K562 cell-based vaccine expressing granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor.89

Disease Monitoring in CML and Residual Disease
In the imatinib era, more sophisticated methods
have been developed for monitoring disease status
and treatment response in patients with CML. After
initial treatment, hematologic and cytogenetic responses are most informative. In patients achieving a
CCyR, residual disease is assessed by measuring the
molecular response (ie, levels of BCR-ABL transcripts
in peripheral blood or bone marrow) using reverse
transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR).90,91 Early BCR-ABL measurements in peripheral blood or bone marrow are predictive of
subsequent cytogenetic response.92 In addition,
achieving a MMR (BCR-ABL:control gene ratio
reduced to 0.1%) after imatinib treatment has prognostic significance. In 2 studies, achieving a MMR
within 12 months was associated with significantly
longer durations of cytogenetic disease remission.93,94 In another trial, significant increases in progression-free survival (measured at 16.5 months)
could be predicted by molecular responses to imatinib at 4 weeks (P ¼ .01) or 3 months (P ¼ .003), and
these effects were found to be independent of
patient age and disease stage.95 In the IRIS study,
100% of patients achieving a CCyR and MMR at 18
months with imatinib were free of disease progression at 5 years, compared with 98% who achieved a
CCyR but not a MMR.17

A complete molecular response (CMR) (ie, undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts) may be useful for predicting long-term response. Because the sensitivity of
detection may vary between centers, results should
be interpreted with caution. In 1 study of 59 patients
with a CCyR after imatinib treatment, none of the
16 patients achieving an undetectable BCR-ABL level
experienced a cytogenetic disease recurrence, whereas
disease recurrence was observed in 30% of patients
without a CMR (13 of 43 patients) (median follow-up
of 43 months).96 Factors that were predictive of
CMR were CCyR at 3 months (P ¼ .024) or 6 months
(P ¼ .038). Although CMR indicates an extremely low
level of residual disease, studies have shown that this
does not represent ‘‘cure.’’ Across several reports, imatinib treatment has been discontinued in 32 patients
after achieving a CMR.97–102 Of these, 13 of 32 patients
(41%) continued to demonstrate a CMR without treatment, whereas 19 of 32 patients (59%) experienced
disease recurrence, which often occurred shortly after
treatment cessation.
An important part of molecular monitoring is to
identify mutations in BCR-ABL, which may signal
imatinib resistance.90,91 Alternative therapies can
then be considered at the earliest opportunity.

CONCLUSIONS
Imatinib has provided treatment benefits for a large
number of patients with CML. However, imatinib resistance represents a significant clinical problem that
may not be overcome by an increase in dose. Novel
treatment strategies have been investigated in
patients with CML and a failure of imatinib therapy.
Dasatinib, a novel agent targeting multiple kinases,
has demonstrated efficacy in patients with imatinib
intolerance or resistance and is now available. Nilotinib, a novel derivative of imatinib, has shown promise
in clinical trials. Both agents have the potential to be
effective in patients whose disease is caused by
mutated forms of Bcr-Abl that do not respond to imatinib. Although SCT remains an important treatment
option that may cure CML, it is now often used as
second-line or third-line therapy after the failure of
imatinib and second-generation TKIs. Other strategies currently are in clinical development, including
combination treatments and immunotherapy. Overall,
treatment options are increasing for patients with
CML, and this is likely to continue in the future.
