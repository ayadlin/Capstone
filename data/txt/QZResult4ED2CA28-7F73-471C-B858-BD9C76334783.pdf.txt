temozolomide (TMZ) in adults with recurrent low-grade spinal cord gliomas with
a primary objective of determining progression-free survival (PFS) was performed.

METHODS. Twenty-two patients (11 men and 11 women) aged 20 years to 55 years
(median, 35 years) with recurrent spinal cord gliomas (World Health Organization
grade 2 astrocytoma in 19 patients and oligoastrocytoma in 3 patients) were treated. All had previously been treated with surgery and involved-field radiotherapy.
Thirteen patients underwent repeat surgery. All patients were chemotherapy–
naive. TMZ was administered at a dose of 150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive
days every 4 weeks (operationally defined as a single cycle). Neurologic and neuroradiographic evaluations were performed every 8 weeks.

RESULTS. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. A total of 266
cycles of TMZ (median, 14 cycles; range, 2 cycles-24 cycles) was administered.
TMZ-related toxicity included constipation (9 patients, 1 with grade 3), lymphopenia (9 patients, 1 with grade 3), fatigue (7 patients, 1 with grade 3), neutropenia (6 patients, 2 with grade 3), and thrombocytopenia (6 patients, 2 with grade
3). Four (18%) patients demonstrated a partial radiographic response, 12 (55%)
demonstrated stable disease, and 6 (27%) had progressive disease after 2 cycles
of TMZ. Time to tumor progression ranged from 2 months to 28 months (median, 14.5 months). Survival ranged from 4 months to 39 months (median,
23 months). PFS at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months was 64%,
64%, 41%, and 27%, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. TMZ demonstrated modest efficacy with acceptable toxicity in
this cohort of adult patients with recurrent low-grade spinal cord gliomas. Cancer

rimary spinal cord tumors are infrequent, with approximately
1200 new adult cases per year in the US, and comprise 5% of all
primary central nervous system malignancies.1-10 Spinal cord
tumors are categorized by spinal compartment, with 20% to 40%
being intradural intramedullary. Approximately 80% of adult intramedullary spinal cord tumors are gliomas, of which 40% are astrocytomas. The majority (75%) of intramedullary spinal cord gliomas
are low-grade, with 5-year life expectancies exceeding 70%.1,4,9 Survival of intramedullary spinal cord tumors is a function of preoperative neurological function, tumor histology, and extent of surgical
resection.1,9 Standard therapy for newly diagnosed patients with intramedullary tumors is maximum safe resection and, in instances of

low-grade tumors, often observation, if a complete or
near–complete resection is performed.1-10 In patients
who undergo biopsy or subtotal surgical resection
only, involved-field radiotherapy is most often administered.4 Less clear is the utility of chemotherapy in
the management of intramedullary spinal cord gliomas, although anecdotal evidence exists for use at
the time of tumor recurrence.11-16 The majority of
reports using chemotherapy in this context have
used nitrosourea-based chemotherapy. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral methylating chemotherapy, has
profoundly altered the management of adult intracranial gliomas, and is now considered standard
therapy for adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.17
The present report is a retrospective series of 22
adults with surgery- and radiation-refractory, recurrent, low-grade intramedullary spinal cord gliomas
(SC-LGA). The primary objective was to determine
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent SC-LGA treated with TMZ.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The retrospective study was performed at the University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive
Cancer Center and Hospital and the University of
South Florida H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and
Research Institute. Patients were treated between
January 2000 and June 2007. Approval for the retrospective analysis was obtained from the university
human investigation committee. Consent was
obtained from each subject after disclosing the
potential risks of TMZ and discussion of potential alternative treatment, including no treatment.

Objectives and Endpoints
The 2 primary objectives of this retrospective study
were determination of efficacy and toxicity of TMZ
in the treatment of adults with surgery- and radiation-refractory recurrent SC-LGA. The primary endpoint was PFS (at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months,
and 24 months). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to disease progression, and
response.
Patient Selection
Patients had a histologically proven SC-LGA (World
Health Organization [WHO] grade II glioma) that
was recurrent neuroradiographically. All patients had
developed disease progression after definitive radiotherapy and surgery. All patients were chemotherapy–
naive. At least 3 months must have elapsed since
radiotherapy, and patients must have recovered from

the adverse effects of prior therapy. Patients were
required to have radiographically measurable intramedullary disease wherein recurrent tumor was bidimensionally measurable (at least 0.5 cm 3 0.5 cm)
by spinal contrast-enhanced or fluid-attenuated
inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histologic confirmation of tumor recurrence was not required for entry into the study.
Pregnant or lactating women were not permitted
to participate. Patients of child-bearing potential
were required to implement adequate contraceptive
measures during chemotherapy. Patients had a Karnofsky performance status 50 and a life expectancy
>3 months.
Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic functions were required, and were defined by the following: absolute granulocyte count >1500/dL or white
blood cell count >4000/dL, platelet count >100,000/
dL, total bilirubin level <1.8 mg/dL, transaminase
level <4 times the upper limit of normal, and creatinine concentration <1.8 mg/dL (or creatinine clearance 60 mL/m2/1.73).
Patients with carcinomatous meningitis were not
eligible, nor were patients with pilocytic astrocytomas. No serious concurrent medical illnesses or
active infection could be present that would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive TMZ therapy.
Patients could not have an active concomitant malignancy except skin cancer (squamous cell or basal
cell). Patients could range in age from 18 years to
80 years.

Drug Schedule
TMZ (Temodar; Schering-Plough, NJ) was administered orally for 5 consecutive days (at a dose of 150200 mg/m2 in a single daily dose) every 4 weeks
(operationally defined as a cycle of therapy). TMZ
was obtained commercially and billed to third-party
payers. No pharmaceutical sponsorship was provided
in the conduct of this retrospective study. Every
8 weeks and after 2 cycles of TMZ, patients were reevaluated with MRI of the spine. If clinically and
radiographically stable or improved, patients were
then retreated with TMZ in the same manner. Subsequent clinical and neuroradiographic evaluations
were performed every other month. Alternative glioma-directed therapy (or no therapy) was offered to
patients who radiographically progressed. Complete
blood counts were obtained on Days 1 and 23 of
each 28-day TMZ cycle. Concurrent medications
were permitted, and included narcotics (15 patients),
anticonstipation medication (14 patients), anticonvulsants (gabapentin; 10 patients), dexamethasone (8
patients), bladder antispasmodics (8 patients), mus-

Temozolomide for Recurrent Spinal Cord Gliomas/Chamberlain

cle relaxants (diazepam; 6 patients), and anticoagulants (2 patients). Modified neuroradiographic response
criteria as defined by Macdonald et al, van den Bent
et al, and Karim et al were used.18-20
Concurrent dexamethasone was permitted for
control of neurologic signs and symptoms. Premedication included antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, or dolasetron) that were given 1 to 2 hours
before TMZ dosing. Postchemotherapy medication
included prochlorperazine for nausea or vomiting.
Treatment with TMZ was repeated every 28 days,
provided that all hematologic toxicity from the previous cycle had resolved to grade 2 or less, and all
nonhematologic toxicity had recovered to grade 1 or
less. If recovery had not occurred by Day 21, the subsequent cycle of TMZ was delayed until these criteria
were met. All toxicities including hematologic due to
TMZ therapy were rated according to the National
Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria (version
3.0).
A single dose escalation of TMZ was permitted,
from 150 mg/m2/d to 200 mg/m2/day. Dose reduction for toxicity was by 25% in patients with grade
3 toxicity after recovery from myelosuppression.
Only 2 dose reductions were allowed. Patients having
grade 3 toxicity of any type after 2 dose reductions
were removed from the study, as were patients
delayed >2 weeks from their next scheduled chemotherapy.
Oral dexamethasone was used concurrently in 8
patients, and was added for 6 patients with clinical
disease progression. Dexamethasone dose was
decreased in 3 patients as patient clinical status permitted.

Method of Evaluation
Blood counts were obtained on Days 1 and 22 of
each TMZ cycle (or more often if clinically indicated), neurologic examination was performed every
4 weeks, and contrast-enhanced spine MRI was performed every 8 weeks after 2 cycles of TMZ.
Modified neuroradiographic response criteria as defined
by Macdonald et al, Macdonald et al, van den
Bent et al, and Karim et al were used18-20
In patients with stable disease, partial response, or
complete response, 2 additional cycles of TMZ were
administered, after which patients were assessed
again as described. Patients continued to receive
TMZ therapy until documentation of progressive disease, at which time patients discontinued TMZ, and
were either monitored or offered alternative therapy.
PFS and overall survival (OS) were defined as the
time from the first day of treatment with TMZ until

1021

disease progression or death (PFS) or death (OS).
Patients discontinued TMZ if there was progressive
disease, development of unacceptable toxicity, or
patient refusal or noncompliance with treatment.

RESULTS
Study Population
Twenty-two patients (11 men and 11 women) aged
20 years to 55 years (median, 35 years), with recurrent SC-LGA (original pathology reviewed and confirmed in all cases) were treated with TMZ (Table 1).
Recurrent SC-LGA was defined by objective neuroradiographic disease progression (>25% increase in
tumor size) as compared with prior baseline neuroradiographic images, using a modification of criteria
reported by Macdonald et al, Macdonald et al, van
den Bent et al, and Karim et al.18-20 All neuroradiography was reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists blinded
to treatment and by the treating neuro-oncologist.
All patients underwent spine MRI demonstrating
progressive disease within 2 weeks of TMZ administration. Thirteen (59%) patients underwent a reoperation (subtotal in all), in which repeat tumor
histology was consistent with SC-LGA.
Patients presented at the time of tumor recurrence with the following signs and symptoms: worsening myelopathy (16 patients), bladder or bowl
disturbance (10 patients), pain (9 patients), gait disturbance (6 patients), and sensory loss (5 patients).
Patient performance status using the Karnofsky scale
ranged from 50 to 90 (median, 70) at the time of
documented tumor recurrence and the initiation of
TMZ therapy. Tumor locations were as follows: cervical (9 patients), cervicothoracic (3 patients), thoracic
(8 patients), and thoracolumbar (2 patients). Six
patients had a tumor-associated syrinx. Pathology
demonstrated all tumors to be grade 2 gliomas
(astrocytoma in 19 patients and oligoastrocytoma in
3 patients) based on WHO criteria.
All patients had been treated previously with surgery in which a complete resection was accomplished in 7 patients, a partial resection in 8 patients,
and biopsy only in 7 patients (Table 1). Thirteen
(59%) patients underwent a second surgery (all subtotal resections) before TMZ chemotherapy with confirmation of original pathology.
All patients had previously been treated with
limited-field radiotherapy (adjuvant in 15 patients
and at time of first recurrence in 6 patients) (Table 1).
In all, conventional fractionated radiotherapy was
used in which 1.8 to 2.0 grays (Gy) was administered
daily, with a median tumor dose of 54 Gy (range, 54
Gy-56 Gy). Two patients were in addition treated
with stereotactic radiotherapy (CyberKnife).

TMZ was administered by the standard 5-day
schedule and initiated after documentation of tumor
progression as demonstrated by neuroradiographic
progression (in all patients) or clinical disease progression (in 60% of patients). The median time to the
initiation of TMZ after initial surgery was 65 months,
with a range of 38 to 122 months. The median time
to the initiation of TMZ after radiotherapy (including
CyberKnife) was 40 months, with a range of 16
months to 119 months. A total of 266 cycles of TMZ
were administered. A minimum of 2 cycles of TMZ
were administered to each patient, with a median of
14 cycles (range, 2 cycles-24 cycles). TMZ was administered at the prescribed dose in all patients. No
other antiglioma agents aside from dexamethasone
were used during the study. Fourteen patients
received another chemotherapy session after developing disease progression while receiving TMZ.

Toxicity
Toxicity was recorded for all grades for all patients by
type using the National Cancer Institute’s Common

Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Table 2 lists all grade 2
to 5 toxicities observed, with each figure representing
the sum of the highest grade of toxicity attained, per
toxicity, per cycle for all patients. A total of 266 treatment cycles were administered, of which there were
11 (4%) grade 3 adverse events (AE) and no grade 4
or 5 AE. The most common grade 3 AE were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (<1% of the total number of TMZ cycles each). No patient required
transfusion, nor were there any episodes of neutropenic fever. No treatment-related death occurred.
Three patients required a dose reduction (to 150 mg/
m2/day for 5 days); otherwise all patients were treated at a dose of 200 mg/m2/day 3 5 days after a single cycle at 150 mg/m2/day 3 5 days.

Response
All patients were assessable for response and 19
patients were assessable for survival (Table 1). After 2
cycles of TMZ, 6 patients (27%) demonstrated progressive disease. Fifteen (68%) patients %received 6
cycles of TMZ. At the conclusion of TMZ, Karnofsky

performance status ranged from 30 to 80, with a median of 60, in the entire study group.
No patient demonstrated a complete response, 4
(18%) patients demonstrated a neuroradiographic
partial response (1 treated by the 150 mg/m2/day
dosing schedule and 3 treated by the 200 mg/m2/day
dosing schedule), and 12 (55%) patients demonstrated stable disease. Thed overall median time
to tumor progression was 14.5 months (range,
2 months–28 months), and the median survival was
23 months (range, 4 months–39 months). The probability of survival at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months,
and 24 months was 64%, 64%, 41%, and 27%, respectively. At the time of last follow–up, 19 patients had
died and 3 were alive and receiving alternative
therapy. All deaths were either directly or indirectly
attributable to the effects of progressive tumor.
Fourteen patients were treated with a platinoid
(carboplatin) after failure on TMZ. None of these 14
patients demonstrated a response to the platinoid;
however, 3 patients had prolonged stable disease patterns (>6 month PFS) and at the time of last follow–
up were continuing to receive treatment.

DISCUSSION
The treatment of recurrent low-grade spinal cord
gliomas in adults is problematic for several reasons.
In addition from surgery and radiotherapy, to our
knowledge there are few data regarding the utility of
chemotherapy in the treatment of spinal cord gliomas.11-16 Trials of chemotherapy for recurrent spinal
cord gliomas are challenging because these tumors
are infrequent (10-fold less common than brain
tumors), and consequently have not been considered

1023

by brain tumor consortia. Therefore, the literature
regarding chemotherapy of spinal cord tumors is
comprised of case reports that provide limited practical guidance. Most often, these case reports, similar
to the current study, use chemotherapy regimens
used for intracranial gliomas.11-16
Increasingly, stereotactic reradiation is administered for spinal cord tumors through the CyberKnife
radiotherapy system, a therapy used in 2 patients in
this series. To our knowledge, the role of reradiation
of spinal cord tumors is unclear because there are no
prospective trials that address this issue. However,
not all recurrent SC-LGAs will be amenable to CyberKnife reradiation, nor is the system at present widely
available.
Reoperation may provide palliation for recurrent
gliomas, and was used in 59% of patients in the current series. Although 13 of 22 patients in this present
study underwent reoperation with second pathology
again demonstrating a low-grade glioma, it is likely
that some patients manifested a recurrence as a
high-grade glioma.5 This is a potential problem in all
chemotherapy trials of low-grade gliomas, regardless
of tumor location.19-21
Evaluating spinal cord gliomas radiographically
can be difficult, because image quality varies considerably more than brain MRI. Furthermore, the small
size of the spinal cord makes tumor measurements
challenging. In addition, because to our knowledge
there are no prospective chemotherapy trials of spinal cord gliomas, there are no validated MRI
response criteria as compared with brain. Consequently, this study used a modification of brain
response criteria of Macdonald et al for determining
response to TMZ chemotherapy by measuring tumor
using both FLAIR and T1W postcontrast MR imaging.18 This method of evaluation is similar to that
used in randomized trials of intracranial low-grade
gliomas in adults.19-21
This retrospective study suggests TMZ, when
used at this dosage, has modest efficacy as reflected
in the PFS (18-month PFS: 41%; 24-month PFS: 27%)
and median survival (23 months) for recurrent adult
SC-LGA. Because to our knowledge there are no prospective studies demonstrating a benefit of chemotherapy for recurrent spinal cord gliomas, there are
no baseline studies to compare with the current retrospective trial. Nonetheless, similar data exist
regarding the efficacy of TMZ in treating intracranial
LGA.22-27 Strategies to improve TMZ effectiveness,
such as extended or dose-intense TMZ schedules,
the blockade of alkylation DNA repair (ie, using alkyl
guanine transferase suicide substrates), or the inhibition of base excision repair, are being evaluated for

1024

intracranial gliomas, and may be adapted for the
treatment of spinal cord gliomas.28-30 Increasingly,
clinical trials of intracranial gliomas stratify patients
based on tumor content of the DNA repair enzyme
O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT).31
Patients with low tumor MGMT expression appear
most likely to respond to alkylator-based chemotherapy. However, tumor MGMT analysis was not performed in the current study, and it is uncertain
whether MGMT expression predicts TMZ response
in spinal cord gliomas, as it does in intracranial
gliomas.
Alternative chemotherapy regimens, including
targeted therapies, may in addition have efficacy
comparable or superior to TMZ, although the side
effect profile of TMZ (4% grade 3 toxicity in the current study) is appealing both to patients and to treating physicians.
In conclusion, TMZ demonstrated modest efficacy with acceptable toxicity in this cohort of adult
patients with recurrent low-grade spinal cord gliomas
who had failed prior surgery and radiotherapy.
