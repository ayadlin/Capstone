BACKGROUND: In elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), the addition of bortezomib to standard,
combined oral melphalan and prednisone (MP) significantly increases the response rate and event-free survival compared with MP
alone. METHODS: In this phase 1/2 trial, the authors assessed the dosing, efficacy, and safety of a lower dose-intensity MP schedule
plus weekly bortezomib as salvage treatment for elderly patients with MM. To assess the maximum tolerated dose, 19 patients who
had relapsed/refractory MM after 1 or 2 lines of treatment entered the first phase of the study. They received melphalan at a dose of
24 mg for 28 days; bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; and prednisone at a dose of 50 mg every other day of a 28-day
cycle for a total of 9 cycles. At the end of the first phase, based on the good efficacy and acceptable toxicity of this combination, an
additional 23 patients were enrolled. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 21 months, of 42 patients who relapsed, 24 (57%)
obtained at least a partial response, 4 had stable disease, and 11 had progressive disease. The median time to progression was 18
months, and the median overall survival was 30 months. Grade 3 and 4 toxicity was observed in 16 of 42 patients (38%) and was
more frequent during the early cycles. CONCLUSIONS: A weekly infusion of bortezomib associated with lower dose-intensity MP
induced a high proportion of responses and was well tolerated in elderly patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Cancer 2013;119:971-7.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a uniformly fatal malignancy of the plasma cells. The median age of patients at diagnosis is
approximately 70 years, and approximately 33% of patients are aged 75 years. Recently, new advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MM have led to the introduction of agents that hit multiple pathways of malignant plasma
cells and their cross-talk with the bone marrow microenvironment. Melphalan is 1 of the most active drugs for the treatment of MM1 and is used in association with prednisone and, more recently, with new drugs for elderly patients or for
younger patients at a high dose with hematopoietic stem cell support (autologous or allogeneic). Among the new drugs,
bortezomib was the first proteasome inhibitor to enter the clinic and to be approved for the treatment of MM.2 The
rationale for combining bortezomib with combined melphalan and prednisone (MP) chemotherapy is based on the different mechanisms of action and the potential synergism of bortezomib with melphalan and steroids. In vitro, it has been
demonstrated that bortezomib restores melphalan sensitivity to melphalan-resistant cell lines and synergizes with melphalan in killing myeloma cells, thereby allowing the use of lower concentrations of melphalan.3 Bortezomib (Velcade;
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass) plus standard MP (VMP) significantly increased response rates and
remission durations compared with historic controls who received MP alone.4 The VMP combination has been approved
for previously untreated patients who are ineligible for stem cell transplantation; in addition, bortezomib alone or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has been approved for patients with relapsed MM.5,6 The recommended
dose and schedule of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 administered as a bolus intravenous injection on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a
21 day cycle.7 The limitation of this schedule is the peripheral neuropathy, a well known and important side effect of bortezomib,8 which produces a primarily small fiber and painful, axonal, sensory distal neuropathy and often leads to dose

modifications and drug discontinuation.9 To reduce toxicity and improve patient compliance, a weekly infusion
of bortezomib has been used in different trials. In a study
by Reeder et al,10 after the first 33 patients received twiceweekly bortezomib, an additional series of 30 patients
received weekly infusions. The rate of grade 3 and 4
adverse events was lower in the group that received onceweekly bortezomib compared with the group that received
twice-weekly bortezomib (grade 3, 37% vs 48%; grade 4,
3% vs 12%). In an Italian Group for Adult Hematologic
Diseases (GIMEMA) study,11 nonhematologic grade 3
and 4 adverse events were reported in 35% of patients
who received once-weekly treatment and in 51% of
patients who received twice-weekly treatment. The incidence of grade 3 and 4 peripheral neuropathy was 8% in
the once-weekly group and 28% in the twice-weekly
group. In both studies, improvement in the safety profile
was not associated with any reduction in the regimen’s efficacy. Concerning adverse events, hematologic toxicity is
the main, unfavorable, dose-limiting effect of oral melphalan and is manifested mainly by leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia when used at the standard dose of 0.18
mg/kg (50 mg per month). Myelosuppression usually
occurs after 2 to 3 weeks of melphalan therapy, but leukopenia may occur in a proportion of patients after 5 days.
Leukocyte and platelet counts usually return to normal
levels during the fifth week, but leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia may persist for 6 weeks or longer after drug
discontinuation. However, irreversible bone marrow
depression has been reported in some patients who
received the drug; therefore, the patient’s hematologic status must be carefully monitored. Lower doses of melphalan may offer clinical utility, overcoming this adverse
event. In a phase 1/2 study, Berenson et al12 defined the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as 1.0 mg/m2 bortezomib and 0.10 mg/kg melphalan, which, in patients with
relapsed or refractory MM, led to a response rate of 68%.
These encouraging results led us to use low-dose melphalan; and, based on our previously experience,13 we chose
the continuous administration. It is well documented that
glucocorticoids have antitumor activity in MM, and several
different doses and schedules of prednisone have been
used. According to Southwest Oncology Group trial
9210l,14 we used a prednisone dose of 50 mg every other
day. We designed the current study to determine whether a
novel VMP schedule (lower melphalan dose intensity at 24
mg for 28 days and weekly bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2) is
safe and capable of inducing a significant partial response
(PR) rate in elderly patients with relapse/refractory MM,
including patients aged 75 years who are vulnerable
972

because of their comorbid conditions, which complicate
the presentation and management of the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

Between March 2008 and February 2010, 42 patients
with MM were enrolled in the current study. We obtained
informed consent from all patients, the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,
and the protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. To take part in this study, patients had to have
relapsed or refractory disease after receiving 1 or 2 lines of
treatment, including high-dose chemotherapy with stem
cell support, conventional polychemotherapy, thalidomide, and bortezomib and melphalan-based regimens;
and they had to exhibit any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not necessarily, an immunoglobulin G M-protein level >1 g/dL and an
immunoglobulin A M-protein level >0.5 g/dL) and,
when applicable, a urine light-chain excretion level >200
mg/24 hours or nonsecretory myeloma, >30% plasma
cells in the bone marrow, and at least 1 plasmacytoma
level >2cm, as determined by clinical examination or applicable imaging studies (ie, magnetic resonance image or
computed tomography scan). Patients who had pre-existing peripheral neuropathy or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment were excluded.
Study Design

The primary objective of this phase 1/2, multicenter, Italian, noncomparative, open-label study was to assess the
safety and efficacy (a PR or better) of the VMP regimen as
salvage treatment for elderly patients with advanced and
refractory MM. The secondary objectives were to determine the durations of progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS). In the first stage of the study, prednisone was combined with different dose levels of melphalan and different schedules of bortezomib in 19 patients
to define the MTD, which was evaluated after the first 3
cycles of VMP. The MTD dose was defined by 2 parameters (Table 1): the number of patients who obtained a
response (at least 5 PRs) and the number of patients
(<10) who presented with the following toxicities: grade
4 neutropenia for >4 weeks or grade 4 hematologic toxicity, except for neutropenia, or any grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. The plan was to test the dose levels of
melphalan and bortezomib described below.
Level 0: Starting dose

The starting dose consisted of melphalan 24 mg for
28 days for a total of 9 cycles (2 mg on Monday,

Level 21

The next dose level was melphalan 24 mg for 28
days for a total of 9 cycles (2 mg on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday every week for a total of 9 cycles) and bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 as a bolus intravenous injection on days 1,

total of 5 cycles.
Level 11

The þ1 dose level was melphalan 48 mg for 28 days
for a total of 9 cycles (4 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday every week for a total of 9 cycles) and bortezomib
1.3 mg/m2 as a bolus intravenous injection on days 1, 8,
15, and 22. Each cycle was repeated every 28 days for a
total of 9 cycles.
Patients were observed through the first 3 cycles of
therapy to evaluate side effects and response rates. At the
end of this first phase, an additional series of 23 patients
was enrolled.
Drug Administration

In this trial, we started with a reduced dose of melphalan
(24 mg for 28 days: 2 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday every week), bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 as a bolus
intravenous injection on days 1, 8, 15, and 22), and
prednisone (50 mg every other day) for a total of 9 cycles,
as soon as the screening visits of the pretreatment period
had been completed. The plan was to modify the dose of
bortezomib and/or melphalan in accordance with the
toxicity registered during the first phase of the study. A
new cycle was allowed if the neutrophil count was >1 
109/L, the platelet count was >50  109/L, and nonhematologic adverse events were grade <2. A delay of 2
weeks was allowed without any dose modification. A

Efficacy and Safety Assessments

Blood samples were collected at screening, during the
treatment period at each scheduled bortezomib administration, and during long-term follow-up until the development of confirmed disease progression. Treatment
response was monitored by measuring serum and urine
protein levels using uniform response criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group to define responses.15
All adverse events were assessed at each visit and graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (version 3).16 Treatment outcome was
evaluated in terms of PFS and OS. PFS was calculated
from the time of initial diagnosis to the time of progression, relapse after response, or death from any cause. Follow-up for patients who did not experience 1 of these
events was censored at the date of last contact. OS was calculated from the time of initial diagnosis to the time of
death from any cause, and the follow-up of surviving
patients was censored at the last contact date.
Statistical Analysis

The study design, according to the Bryant and Day
method,17 was a 2-stage phase 1/2 trial. Nineteen patients
were required for the first phase; and, based on the firstphase results, the study was allowed to continue to a second stage, which included an additional group of 23
patients (for a total of 42 patients). Estimates of PFS and
OS distribution were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method,18 and time-to-event distributions were compared using the log-rank test.19
RESULTS
Patients

Between March 2008 and February 2010, 42 elderly

The median patient age was 73 years (interquartile range
[IQR], 70-79 years), and 18 patients were aged >75
years. The median hemoglobin value was 10.5 g/dL
(IQR, 9.75-11.8 g/dL), and 7 patients (16.7%) had renal
insufficiency (creatinine >1.5 mg/dL). Eleven of 42
patients (26%) had received 2 lines of therapy, including
a bortezomib-based regimen in 26% of patients. Prior
therapies included steroids, alkylating agents, anthracyclines, thalidomide, lenalidomide, or a combination of
these agents. Thirty-three percent of patients had
received prior high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell
transplantation. The median time from diagnosis to the
first dose of VMP therapy was 40 months (IQR, 24-64
months). All patients were analyzed for response on the
date of follow-up.
Dose Findings

After 3 cycles of dose level 0 (melphalan 24 mg for 28
days and bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22
repeated every 28 days), the first 19 patients were evaluated for side effects and response rate. The 12 PRs
obtained and the 7 episodes of grade 3 and 4 toxicities
observed allowed us to continue the same dose for the subsequent 23 patients.

Efficacy

After a median follow-up of 21 months (IQR, 17-26
months), 24 patients achieved at least a PR. The overall
response rate (ORR) was 57%, and it rose to 66.5%
when patients who had stable disease were considered
(Table 3). The median time to progression was 18
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.8-20.2
months), and the PFS rate at 37 months was 21% (95%
CI, 10%-45%) (Fig. 1). Sixteen patients died of from disease progression, 1 patient died from acute heart failure,
1 patient died from pulmonary edema, and 2 patients
died from infections. The median OS was 30 months
(95% CI, 17.2-37 months), and the OS rate at 37
months was 44% (95% CI, 28%-69%) (Fig. 2).
Safety

During the first phase of our study, grade 3 and 4 toxicity

reduced to 1 mg/m2 and were able to continue the treatment. Because of toxicity, 4 patients discontinued treatment, including 1 patient who had a near complete
response, 2 patients who had a PR, and 1 patient with
stable disease. Two patients received granulocyte colonystimulating factor support; and, with the receipt of acyclovir prophylaxis, no herpes reactivation was recorded.

Nonhematologic Toxicity

DISCUSSION
MM is an incurable malignancy, and the majority of
patients relapse, regardless of their initial treatment. For
relapsed patients, a combination regimen based on the
receipt of a novel agent backbone is an attractive therapeutic option that has the potential to allow a longer duration
of response compared with previous regimens.20 Therefore, personalized therapy using dose-adjusted regimens is
urgently needed for patients aged 75 years who are vulnerable because of their comorbid conditions, which complicate the presentation and management of the disease.
In the current phase 1/2 study of elderly patients with
relapsed/refractory MM, we evaluated the efficacy and
safety profile of a novel VMP schedule (melphalan 24 mg
for 28 days, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 weekly, and prednisone 50 mg every other day). In our 2-stage, phase 1/2
trial, the response and toxicity observed among the initial
19 patients of the first phase of the study allowed us to
continue with the same drug doses in an additional 23
patients. We designed this trial on the basis of the results
reported in the literature. The results from the ‘‘Velcade
as Initial Standard Therapy in Multiple Myeloma: Assessment With Melphalan and Prednisone’’ (VISTA) trial21
identified VMP as 1 of the new standards of care for the
initial treatment of patients with newly diagnosed MM
who were not eligible for high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. However, approximately
half (46%) of the patients who received VMP in on
975

Original Article

VISTA protocol experienced serious adverse events, and
approximately 33% discontinued VMP treatment or discontinued only bortezomib because of adverse events.
Neuropathy is a key iatrogenic toxicity in patients with
MM, often leading to dose modifications and drug discontinuation. In newly diagnosed patients, bortezomibinduced neuropathy occurs in 47% to 64% of patients,
and rates of dose modification and drug discontinuation
of 14% to 30% attributable to neuropathy have been
reported.4,8 In view of the high incidence of discontinuation using twice-weekly bortezomib, the once-weekly
schedule has been used in different trials. The randomized
phase 3 GIMEMA trial,22 in which VMP plus thalidomide followed by maintenance with bortezomib and thalidomide was compared with VMP, was amended; and, in
both treatment arms, the schedule of bortezomib was
reduced from twice weekly to once weekly. Although the
overall rate of grade 3 and 4 hematologic adverse events
was similar between the once-weekly and twice-weekly
groups, thrombocytopenia, which is a major side effect of
bortezomib, was slightly less frequent in the once-weekly
group. Similarly, the rate of grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic adverse events was lower in the once-weekly group
compared with the twice-weekly group. The main doselimiting toxicity, as expected, was neuropathy, which was
predominantly sensory. The rates of discontinuation (5%
vs 15%) and of dose reduction (17% vs 41%) as a result of
neuropathy were significantly lower in the once-weekly
group versus the twice-weekly group, resulting in similar
cumulative doses of bortezomib in the 2 groups. In a study
by the Spanish Cooperative Group for the Treatment of
Hematologic Malignancies (PETHEMA),23 in which 1
cycle of twice-weekly bortezomib was followed by onceweekly dosing, the rate of grade 3 and 4 neuropathy with
VMP was 5%, confirming an improvement in the safety
profile without a reduction in the efficacy of the regimen.
The current results demonstrate that our VMP schedule is
well tolerated, with predictable and manageable toxicities,
and that it is associated with clinical activity in elderly
patients with relapsed or refractory MM. The combination of melphalan 24 mg for 28 days, bortezomib 1.3 mg/
m2 weekly, and prednisone 50 mg every other day provides an alternative treatment option for elderly patients,
for those who have an increased risk of experiencing significant morbidities from these agents, and for patients
aged 75 years. In our study using these 3 drugs, the
ORR was 57%, consistent with the rate of 67% obtained
using 4 drugs (bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone, and
thalidomide24) in 30 patients with relapsed MM who
were younger than our cohort. Berenson et al25 demon976

strated that significant clinical activity can be achieved
using lower doses of melphalan and a longer and more
convenient 28-day cycle of bortezomib. In their study,
responses occurred in 32 of 46 (70%) evaluable patients.
The median PFS in our study was 18 months, which was
longer than that obtained with bortezomib in the ‘‘Assessment of Proteasome Inhibition for Extending Remissions’’ (APEX) study (8 months) or with lenalidomide
and dexamethasone (12 months).26 In our patients,
adverse events were manageable and predictable: Thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse event, and
neutropenia was less common. Severe grade 3 and 4 neuropathy was observed in only 3 patients.
Taken together, the results from the current study
demonstrate that VMP can be administered safely and
effectively to elderly patients with relapsed/refractory
MM. The schedule is specially tailored for elderly patients
who are not eligible for intensive treatment, a group for
which the ability to ensure an advantage in terms of
response and survival, with an associated low rate of toxicity, is a primary unmet medical need.
