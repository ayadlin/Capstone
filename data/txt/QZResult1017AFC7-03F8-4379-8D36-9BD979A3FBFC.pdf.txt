Summary
Acquired resistance to ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) through ABL1 kinase domain
mutations, particularly the gatekeeper mutant T315I, is a significant problem for chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) patients. Using structure-based drug design, we developed compounds that bind
to residues (Arg386/Glu282) ABL1 uses to switch between inactive and active conformations. The
lead “switch-control” inhibitor, DCC-2036, potently inhibits both unphosphorylated and
phosphorylated ABL1 by inducing a type II inactive conformation, and retains efficacy against the
majority of clinically relevant CML resistance mutants, including T315I. DCC-2036 inhibits
BCR-ABL1T315I-expressing cell lines, prolongs survival in mouse models of T315I-mutant CML
and B-lymphoblastic leukemia, and inhibits primary patient leukemia cells expressing T315I in
vitro and in vivo, supporting its clinical development in TKI-resistant Ph+ leukemia.

Introduction
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and a subset of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BALL) are characterized by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and its product, the fusion
tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1, which recapitulates CML-like myeloproliferative disease when
expressed in hematopoietic stem cells in mice (Daley et al., 1990). Motivated by this,
imatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of ABL1, was developed for the
treatment of CML (Deininger and Druker, 2003). Structural studies demonstrate that
imatinib binds to the kinase domain of ABL1 in an inactive conformation, referred to as the
“DFG-out” or Type II conformation (Nagar et al., 2003; Schindler et al., 2000), in which the

ABL1 activation loop tyrosine 393 is unphosphorylated and acts as pseudo-substrate to
impair access to the substrate pocket, while the ATP pocket is blocked by the DFG Phe382.
Such inactive kinase conformations provide unique binding pockets that are distinct from
the corresponding active (Type I) conformations, and targeting of these unique inactive
conformations provides a general strategy for designing selective kinase inhibitors (Huse
and Kuriyan, 2002) that exploit additional binding sites adjacent to the ATP pocket (Liu and
Gray, 2006). The search for robust approaches for the development of Type II inhibitors
remains an intense area of research.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Imatinib induces durable hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in the majority of CML
patients (Druker et al., 2006), but a significant proportion eventually experience disease
progression, frequently as a consequence of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain that
render the enzyme resistant to the drug (Gorre et al., 2001). To date, more than 50 different
point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain have been detected in imatinib-resistant patients
(Shah et al., 2002), some of which confer resistance by impairing the “induced fit” binding
of imatinib to the kinase domain (Roumiantsev et al., 2002). The second generation BCRABL1 TKIs dasatinib (Shah et al., 2004), nilotinib (Kantarjian et al., 2006), and bosutinib
(Puttini et al., 2006) inhibit many of these BCR-ABL1 mutants and provide clinical
responses in imatinib-resistant CML. However, mutation of the gatekeeper residue,
threonine 315, to isoleucine (T315I) causes virtually absolute resistance to all four TKIs, in
part through steric interference with drug binding (Gorre et al., 2001). ABL1 mutations may
also confer imatinib resistance by driving ABL1 towards the active conformation to which
imatinib cannot bind (Azam et al., 2003), which we refer to as conformational escape.
Interestingly, the T315I mutation has been shown to activate c-ABL1 (Azam et al., 2008) by
conformational escape through stabilization of a “hydrophobic spine” that is a structural
feature shared by many activated kinases (Kornev et al., 2006). Conformational escape may
also underlie the resistance of secondary mutants of the c-KIT kinase to imatinib and
sunitinib in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Gajiwala et al., 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In CML, T315I accounts for ~15% of the mutations recovered from patients with imatinib
resistance, but represents the predominant mechanism of acquired resistance to multiple
TKIs (Shah et al., 2007). Mutation of gatekeeper residues in epidermal growth factor
receptor and c-KIT also leads to resistance to TKIs, including gefitinib and erlotinib in lung
cancer (Pao et al., 2005), and imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Wardelmann et al.,
2005). Hence, the development of TKIs that retain potency for gatekeeper mutants is of
major clinical importance. While there are ongoing efforts to develop agents to treat CML
with the T315I BCR-ABL1 mutation, no drugs have yet won approval for this indication.
The aurora kinase inhibitors MK-0457 and PHA-739358 inhibit T315I mutant BCR-ABL1
in vitro (Giles et al., 2007; Gontarewicz et al., 2008), but hematologic responses observed in
clinical trials of these agents may be due predominantly to inhibition of Aurora kinase rather
than BCR-ABL1 (Donato et al., 2010). AP-24534, a TKI that inhibits T315I BCR-ABL1,
has been described recently (O’Hare et al., 2009), and is currently in clinical trials for the
treatment of refractory CML.
We have approached the general problem of inhibitor resistance, and specifically the issue
of conformational escape resistance, by using the concept of ‘switch control pocket’
inhibition to guide drug design (Flynn and Petillo, 2004). When a tyrosine kinase adopts the
active Type I conformation, the transition is promoted by specific “switch control” amino
acids that interact with and stabilize the phosphorylated activation loop tyrosine. These
switch control residues adopt alternative orientations in the inactive, unphosphorylated Type
II state. A switch control inhibitor is designed to interact with these residues in the inactive
conformation, providing a thermodynamic bias for stabilizing the inhibitor-bound Type II
conformation, even in the face of phosphorylation or mutations that otherwise predispose

escape of the kinase to the Type I active conformation. We refer to this type of durable Type
II inhibition as conformational control inhibition. Here, we report on structure-based design
activities that have culminated in the discovery and development of DCC-2036, a
conformational control inhibitor of ABL1, including the BCR-ABL1T315I mutant.

Structure-based design of ABL1 kinase inhibitors that engage the Type II conformation

Although there is currently no reported structure of apo-ABL1 in its active, phosphotyrosine 393 (pY393) Type I conformation, the structure of pY393-ABL1 in complex with
dasatinib (Tokarski et al., 2006) has been reported and shows that pY393 makes binding
interactions with both the catalytic loop arginine 362 (R362) and an activation loop arginine
386 (R386) (Figure S1A). The same R362 and R386 residues make electrostatic interactions
with Y393 in the active conformation co-crystal structure of H396P ABL1 with VX-680
((Young et al., 2006); Figure S1B), while in the structure of activated LCK (Yamaguchi and
Hendrickson, 1996), the homologous R363 and R387 residues also interact with the
activation loop pY394. Thus in both ABL1 and LCK kinases, R386 or its homolog R387
functions as a crucial conformational switch residue to stabilize the activation loop phosphotyrosine in the active Type I state. When ABL1 is dephosphorylated and assumes the Type
II inactive conformation, as inferred from the co-crystal structure with imatinib (Nagar et al.,
2003), the interaction between Y393 and R386 is disrupted: Y393 moves to occupy the
substrate pocket, while R386 moves to a unique inhibitor-accessible region under the Chelix in close proximity to E282 (Figure S1C). The E282/R386 amino acid pair therefore
provides a design element for inhibitor binding to the inactive Type II conformation that is
not available in the Type I conformation.

To this end, several prototype diarylurea inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and
evaluated. From this effort, compounds 1 and 2 were identified (Figures 1A and 1B).
Compound 1 contains a tetrahydro-isoquinoline (THIQ) ring system wherein a basic ring
basic nitrogen was designed for hydrogen bonding to the acidic ABL1 E282 residue and a
pendant carboxylic acid moiety (R = CO2H) was included for hydrogen bonding to the basic
ABL1 R386 residue. Compound 1 also contains a urea moiety to allow a hydrogen bond
with the conserved K271-E286 salt bridge of ABL1, a t-butyl moiety to bind into the
hydrophobic spine at the third pocket position (Kornev et al., 2006), and a 2,3dichlorophenyl ring to stabilize the DFG-phenylalanine F382 in the Type II-out
conformation. Compound 1 exhibited an IC50 of 57 nM for ABL1native and an IC50 of 773
nM for ABL1T315I. Compound 2 replaced the tetrahydro-isoquinoline ring with a quinoline
ring, designed to interact with E282 through an electrostatic interaction. Electrostatic
potential calculations revealed that the C2 carbon of the quinoline ring exhibits the highest
partial positive charge (Figure S1D), focusing and orienting the positive charge toward
E282. Compound 2 exhibited an IC50 of 140 nM for ABL1native and an IC50 of 711 nM for
ABL1T315I. Analogs of compounds 1 and 2 lacking the THIQ or the most distal nitrogencontaining portion of the quinoline ring system were essentially inactive against ABL1 (IC50
>5 μM, Figure S1E), emphasizing the significance of the E282/R386 switch control residues
as an inhibitor-anchoring site.
To confirm the mode of binding of compound 1, an X-ray crystal structure was obtained in
complex with the ABL1native kinase domain (Figure S1F). This structure revealed that the
THIQ ring system of 1 does indeed bind to the E282/R386 switch control residues, with the
THIQ ring basic nitrogen and carboxylic acid moiety making hydrogen bond interactions
with the acidic side chain of E282 (3.26 Å) and the guanidinyl side chain of R386 (3.32 Å),
respectively. Other features of inhibitor binding include hydrogen bond formation between

the urea moiety and the K271-E286 salt bridge, binding of the t-butyl moiety into the third
pocket of the hydrophobic spine, and orientation of the 2,3-dichlorophenyl ring to stabilize
F382 in an edge-face π-interaction. The key bonding interactions between compound 1 and
ABL1native are summarized in Table S1. It is noteworthy that this binding mode affords a 57
nM inhibitor of ABL1 kinase without relying on binding into the ATP pocket hinge region,
a typical requirement of classical Type II and ATP-competitive Type I inhibitors.
Design of dual-anchoring inhibitors of ABL1 that bind both the Glu282/Arg386 switch pair
and the ATP pocket hinge Met318
To improve potency, we next designed inhibitors that provided dual docking sites to both the
switch control pocket E282/R386 pair and also to the ATP hinge, reasoning that such a dualanchoring inhibitor might provide the increased binding energy required to stabilize
oncogenic and resistant forms of ABL1 in the Type II conformation. To probe docking of
inhibitor only to the ATP hinge region, we prepared compound 3 (Figure 1C), which
contains a carboxamide-substituted pyridine ring to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone
of the ATP hinge residue M318. However, compound 3 does not extend in the direction of
the activation loop to engage the switch control E282/R386 residues. Compound 3 exhibited
an IC50 of 88 nM vs. ABL1native, similar in potency to compounds 1 and 2, indicating that
either inhibitor-anchoring mode affords similar potency.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We then combined both E282/R386 switch control-binding and M318-ATP hinge-binding
moieties by synthesizing compound 4 (Figure 1D), and DCC-2036 (Figure 1E). Compound
4 and DCC-2036 exhibited IC50 values of 9 nM and 0.8 nM vs. ABL1native, respectively.
Significantly, these dual-anchoring inhibitors also showed potent inhibition of the
gatekeeper mutant ABL1T315I, with IC50 values of 17 nM and 4 nM, respectively. Thus,
incorporation of the additional switch control pocket-binding quinoline ring in DCC-2036
leads to a 100-fold improvement in potency vs. ABL1native and a 20-fold improvement in
potency vs. gatekeeper mutant ABL1T315I, compared to the prototypic Type II compound 3.
Structure of DCC-2036 bound to ABL1native and gatekeeper mutant ABL1T315I

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Co-crystal structures of DCC-2036 with ABL1native (Figure S2A) and with ABL1T315I
(Figure 2A and Figure S2B) were solved (Table S2). In both structures, DCC-2036 binds to
the DFG-out Type II conformation. Similar to compound 1, the quinoline ring of DCC-2036
forms an electrostatic interaction with E282 (d = 4.06 Å in ABL1native, 3.30 Å in
ABL1T315I; Table S1). In the ABL1native structure, E282 is held in place to retain a
hydrogen bond with R386 (d = 2.76 Å). The urea nitrogens form two hydrogen bonds with
the conserved K271-E286 salt bridge and an additional hydrogen bond between the urea
carbonyl and the backbone amino group of D381, the t-butyl moiety binds into the
hydrophobic spine pocket, thereby forcing the DFG F382 (yellow) out into the mouth of the
ATP pocket, and the carboxamide-substituted pyridine ring forms two hydrogen bonds with
the ATP hinge residue M318. The fluorine substituent on the central phenyl ring is
positioned ortho- to the urea moiety, providing stereoelectronic bias for inducing planarity
of the fluoro-phenyl ring and the urea function. Such stereoelectronic restriction optimally
orients the phenyl ring for π-interaction with F382.
Recently, an activating hydrophobic spine of ABL1T315I has been described (Azam et al.,
2008), wherein a vertical cluster of hydrophobic amino acids stabilizes the Type I active
state. This hydrophobic cluster includes L301, M290, F382, H331, and the additional mutant
I315 as a fifth reinforcing hydrophobic residue further stabilizing the Type I active state
((Modugno et al., 2007), Figure S2C). In the co-crystal structure of DCC-2036 with
ABL1T315I, this activating spine has been disrupted by outward movement of F382 (Figure
2B), which is stabilized by the central 2-fluoro phenyl ring of DCC-2036. The inhibitor also

makes productive hydrophobic contact with the mutant gatekeeper I315 and spine residues
M290 and H361, while the t-butyl residue of DCC-2036 occupies the third position of the
hydrophobic spine as a surrogate of F382, effectively establishing an inhibitory hydrophobic
spine in the interior of the kinase, which includes L301, M290, the inhibitor (DCC-2036 tbutyl moiety), and H361 (Figure 2B).
DCC-2036 inhibits unphosphorylated ABL1native, phospho-ABL1native, ABL1H396P, and
ABL1T315I in a non-ATP-competitive manner

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate the biochemical mechanism of ABL1 inhibition by DCC-2036, we compared
the inhibitory activity of DCC-2036 to that of imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib (Table 1)
against purified native ABL1 in unphosphorylated (u-ABL1native) and phosphorylated (pABL1native) forms, unphosphorylated and phosphorylated gatekeeper mutant ABL1T315I,
and the activation loop mutant ABL1H396P. Consistent with the structural data in Figure
S2A, DCC-2036 potently (IC50 0.82 nM) inhibited u-ABL1native, which is thought to exist
predominantly in the inactive type II conformation. In addition, DCC-2036 also strongly
inhibited p-ABL1native (IC50 2 nM), which more readily adopts an active, Type I
conformation. More significantly, DCC-2036 potently inhibited both u-ABL1T315I (IC50 5
nM) and p-ABL1T315I (IC50 4 nM), both of which exist predominately in the Type I
conformation due to stabilization of an activating hydrophobic spine by the T315I mutation
(Azam et al., 2008). DCC-2036 also potently inhibited ABL1H396P (IC50 1.4 nM), which,
like ABL1T315I, is predisposed to exist predominately in a Type I activated conformation
due to the restricted backbone torsional angles imposed by the mutant Pro396 (Young et al.,
2006). Together, these results argue that DCC-2036 can effectively inhibit forms of ABL1
predisposed to adopt active, DFG-in conformations by forcing the kinase domains into
inhibitor-bound, inactive Type II conformations. By comparison, imatinib had moderate
inhibitory activity only for u-ABL1native (IC50 75 nM) while losing significant potency for
those forms that are predisposed to exist predominately in the ‘switch on’ activated
conformation (p-ABL1native, ABL1H396P, and ABL1T315I). As previously reported (Shah et
al., 2004;Weisberg et al., 2006), dasatinib and nilotinib retained potency for p-ABL1native
and ABL1H396P, but were essentially inactive against mutant ABL1T315I (IC50 >10,000 and
3,800 nM, respectively).
DCC-2036 inhibits ABL1 kinase in a non-ATP-competitive manner and exhibits prolonged
kinase residency time

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For ATP competitive inhibitors such as imatinib, an increase of ATP concentration can
result in significant loss of inhibitor potency. However, DCC-2036 lost little activity against
AblT315I even in the presence of high (5 mM) ATP concentrations that are typical of the
intracellular milieu (Table S3). DCC-2036 exhibited very prolonged off rates (koff) from its
complex with all three ABL1 forms (Table S4). The koff value of 0.00172 min−1 for pABL1native corresponds to a t1/2 value of 402 minutes, demonstrating that DCC-2036, once
bound, exhibits prolonged residency time in complex with ABL1. This off-rate is
considerably longer than the respective values obtained for dasatinib (153 min) and nilotinib
(180 min).
Kinase inhibition profile of DCC-2036
In addition to ABL1, DCC-2036 also inhibited the SRC family kinases SRC, LYN, FGR,
and HCK, and the receptor TKs KDR, FLT3, and TIE2 (Table 2). Notably, DCC-2036
spared c-KIT (IC50 481 nM). DCC-2036 was further evaluated against a broad panel of
human kinases, but did not inhibit a significant number of kinases outside this ensemble
(Table S5).

DCC-2036 inhibits cellular proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing native or mutant BCRABL1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next tested the ability of DCC-2036 to inhibit proliferation of Ba/F3 cells transformed to
interleukin-3-independence by BCR-ABL1native or a series of TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1
mutants arising in the P-loop, the interior N-lobe, the E-helix proximal to the catalytic loop,
the catalytic loop, the activation loop, and the hinge/gatekeeper region (Table 3). Similar to
imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, DCC-2036 effectively inhibited the proliferation of Ba/F3
cells expressing native BCR-ABL1native (IC50 5.4 nM), but DCC-2036 also retained potency
against Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1 mutants that are resistant to imatinib, dasatinib
(T315A), and nilotinib (L248R, Y253H, E255V, F359C), as well as the gatekeeper mutant
BCR-ABL1T315I (IC50 13 nM), where all three FDA-approved TKIs were ineffective.
DCC-2036 also inhibited proliferation of the Ph+ cell line K562 (IC50 5.5 nM), and induced
apoptosis in both BCR-ABL1-expressing Ba/F3 and K562 cells at nanomolar concentrations
(data not shown). Importantly, the growth of parental Ba/F3 cells (in the presence of IL-3)
was not appreciably inhibited by DCC-2036 until concentrations exceeded 3 μM,
demonstrating that the drug is not generally cytotoxic. By contrast, the dual Aurora A/ABL1
kinase inhibitor MK-0457 did not discriminate between parental and BCR-ABL1transformed Ba/F3 cells, indicative of global cytostatic activity (Table 3). In addition to the
T315I mutant, DCC-2036 also inhibited proliferation of several common TKI-resistant
mutants of BCR-ABL1, including G250E, Q252H, Y235F, E255K, V299L, F317L, and
M351T, at IC50 values ranging from 6-150 nM (Table 3). Collectively, these mutants
mediate the majority of clinical TKI resistance in CML patients (O’Hare et al., 2009;Shah et
al., 2002).
DCC-2036 inhibits mutant BCR-ABL1T315I signaling and prolongs survival in a mouse Ba/
F3 cell allograft model
We examined the ability of DCC-2036 to inhibit the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL1 and its
downstream targets STAT5 and CrkL in transformed Ba/F3 cells (Figure 3A). At
concentrations that correlated with its cytotoxic effects, DCC-2036 effectively inhibited
autophosphorylation of BCR-ABL1native (IC50 29 nM) and BCR-ABL1T315I (IC50 18 nM),
as well as the phosphorylation of STAT5 in both cell lines (IC50 28 nM and 13 nM,
respectively). Phosphorylation of the BCR-ABL1 substrate CrkL was also inhibited,
although to a lesser extent, in both cell lines (BCR-ABL1native IC50 495 nM; BCRABL1T315I IC50 2,600 nM). Importantly, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib all failed to
inhibit phosphorylation of BCR-ABL1, STAT5, and CrkL in Ba/F3 cells expressing BCRABL1T315I (IC50 values > 5 μM; data not shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BCR-ABL1-transformed Ba/F3 cells can efficiently engraft syngeneic Balb/c mice
following intravenous injection (Ilaria and Van Etten, 1995), proliferating in blood, marrow
and spleen and eventually causing morbidity and death of the recipients. A single oral dose
of DCC-2036 at 100 mg/kg afforded circulating plasma levels that exceeded 12 μM for up to
24 hours (data not shown), and effectively inhibited BCR-ABL1 signaling for up to 8 hours
in Ba/F3-BCR-ABL1T315I leukemia cells isolated from BM and spleen of tumor-bearing
mice, as assessed by intracellular flow cytometric staining for phospho-STAT5 (Figure 3B)
and immunoblotting of tissue extracts for phospho-BCR-ABL1 and phospho-STAT5 (Figure
3C). Treatment of mice bearing Ba/F3-BCR-ABL1T315I leukemia cells with DCC-2036 at
100 mg/kg once daily by oral gavage significantly prolonged their survival, while imatinib
at 100 mg/kg twice daily was ineffective (Figure 3D). In this aggressive allograft model,
DCC-2036 was as effective for treatment of BCR-ABLT315I leukemia as imatinib at 100 mg/
kg twice daily was for treatment of BCR-ABL1native leukemia, and reduced the leukemia
cell burden in the spleens of treated mice (Figure 3E).

DCC-2036 demonstrates efficacy in retroviral transduction/transplantation mouse models
of BCR-ABL1T315I CML and Ph+ B-ALL

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To extend these results to primary myeloid and lymphoid leukemias induced by BCRABL1, we employed a well-characterized retroviral BM transduction/transplantation model
system. When BM from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated donors is transduced with BCR-ABL1
retrovirus and transplanted intravenously into irradiated mice, recipients develop an
aggressive and fatal CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), characterized by
massive expansion of and extensive organ infiltration by of maturing myeloid cells (Li et al.,
1999). The CML-like MPN arises from hematopoietic stem cells (Hu et al., 2006), and is
transplantable (Li et al., 1999) and responsive to TKI therapy (Hu et al., 2004). When
donors are not treated with 5-FU, recipients of BCR-ABL1-transduced BM instead develop
aggressive precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL), arising from
early lymphoid progenitors (Hu et al., 2006) and characterized by involvement of the BM,
spleen, lymphatics, and pleural cavity (Li et al., 1999).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the CML model, treatment of recipients of BCR-ABL1T315I-transduced BM with
DCC-2036 at 100 mg/kg once daily significantly prolonged their survival from a median of
20 days to 32 days (Figure 4A), and was associated with an improvement in the circulating
leukocyte counts in treated mice (Figure 4B). In BCR-ABL1-induced B-ALL, genetic
studies in mice have implicated SRC family kinases in the disease pathogenesis (Hu et al.,
2004), suggesting that the inhibitory activity of DCC-2036 towards LYN, FGR, and HCK
(Table 2) might be of therapeutic benefit in this disease. Indeed, a previous report suggested
that dasatinib, which also inhibits SRC kinases, has therapeutic activity against B-ALL
induced by T315I BCR-ABL1 in mice (Hu et al., 2006). Accordingly, we also compared the
activity of DCC-2036 against imatinib and dasatinib in mice with B-ALL induced by BCRABL1T315I. DCC-2036 had efficacy that was superior to both imatinib and dasatinib (Figure
4C), significantly prolonging the survival of treated mice (median survival 47 days),
although all mice in this cohort eventually succumbed to B-ALL. Interestingly, we noted
that the histopathology of the B-lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma appeared to be altered in
DCC-2036-treated mice. Rather than developing the malignant hemorrhagic pleural effusion
that was the predominant cause of death in the other three cohorts, the majority (10/14) of
DCC-2036-treated recipients had absent or minimal (<0.1 mL) pleural effusions, but instead
developed hind limb paralysis due to lymphomatous involvement of vertebral spinal cord
(data not shown). This suggests that effective treatment of disease outside the central
nervous system by DCC-2036 might have altered the natural history of the leukemia and
selected for malignant cells residing in a privileged site. Together, these results demonstrate
that oral DCC-2036 has efficacy against primary myeloid and lymphoid leukemias induced
by BCR-ABL1T315I in mice.

DCC-2036 inhibits BCR-ABL1, including the T315I mutant, in primary patient cells in vitro
and in vivo
We tested the ability of DCC-2036 to inhibit myeloid colony formation from BM
mononuclear cells from a patient with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, and a patient
with relapsed CML in accelerated phase who was intolerant of imatinib. DCC-2036
inhibited the formation of myeloid colonies in a concentration-dependent manner that was
equivalent to clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib (Figure 5A). Importantly,
DCC-2036 had minimal toxicity to normal hematopoietic colony-forming cells at
concentrations up to 2000 nM (Figure 5A and data not shown). In leukemic blasts from a
patient with relapsed/refractory Ph+ B-ALL with the T315I mutation, DCC-2036 inhibited
phosphorylation of BCR-ABL1, STAT5, and CrkL (Figure 5B) and decreased cell viability
in vitro (Figure S3A). DCC-2036 also inhibited phosphorylation of CrkL in primary
leukemia cells from a patient with chronic phase CML and L298V mutation (Figure 5B).

Based on these preclinical results, DCC-2036 has been advanced to a phase 1 clinical trial in
patients with Ph+ leukemia that has relapsed or been refractory to at least two of the FDAapproved TKIs (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00827138). In a patient with CML chronic
phase and the T315I mutation who received DCC-2036 (tosylate salt) at a 300 mg dose
level, we observed significant (~65%) suppression of STAT5 phosphorylation in peripheral
blood leukemia cells that was maximum about 2 h following the initial day one dose, with
more sustained inhibition observed following a week of continuous daily dosing (Figure
S3B). In two additional patients, significant inhibition of CrkL phosphorylation in
circulating leukemic cells was observed in the first cycle of treatment, with sustained
inhibition apparent in the second week of therapy (Figure 5C). Together, these results
demonstrate that DCC-2036 is capable of suppressing BCR-ABL1 activity in primary
leukemic cells, both in vitro and in vivo, from patients with Ph+ leukemia who are refractory
to multiple TKIs, including those with the T315I mutation.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Kinases are involved in a broad range of essential cellular functions, and are regulated in
vivo by adopting different conformations. Disruption of kinase conformational regulation
through protein fusions, deletions, or missense mutations can lead to pathologic conditions,
including cancer. We have initiated a broad-based approach to kinase inhibition through
identification of key amino acid residues that are critical for the fluxing of kinases between
conformational states, and the design of inhibitors that bind to such residues.
In ABL1, R386 is a critical anchoring partner for stabilizing pY393 in the active
conformation. In the inactive Type II conformation, R386 and Y393 separate from each
other, with Y393 moving to occupy the substrate pocket, and R386 shifting to the interior of
the kinase towards E282 (Figure S1C). This alternative disposition of E282/R386 provides a
basis for rational inhibitor design. Here, we have demonstrated the utility of this E282/R386
anchor for design of ABL1 inhibitors, culminating in the discovery of DCC-2036. Prototype
inhibitor compounds 1 and 2 (Figure 1), which orient a THIQ or quinoline basic ring system
toward the E282-R386 inhibitory anchor, exhibited potencies in the 57-140 nM range for
ABL1native, whereas close structural analogs lacking functionality for interaction with E282
or R386 were inactive (Figure S1E). It is noteworthy that this level of inhibition, which is
equivalent to the potency of imatinib for ABL1native, is achieved without extending inhibitor
binding into the ATP hinge region. Additionally, compounds 1 and 2 also exhibit potencies
in the 700 nM range for the gatekeeper mutant ABL1T315I. A similar level of potency was
realized by compound 3, which anchors into the ATP hinge but does not extend to the
switch E282-R386 salt bridge.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Combining both an ATP hinge binding anchor and an E282/R386 binding anchor within a
single inhibitor led to compound 4 and DCC-2036, which exhibit much greater potency vs.
ABL1native (IC50 of 9 and 0.8 nM, respectively) and against mutant ABL1T315I (17 and 4
nM, respectively). While compound 3 is equipotent against ABL1native and ABL1T315I and
must therefore avoid steric clash with substitutions at the gatekeeper residue, the ability to
bind both the ATP hinge and the switch control regions is what affords DCC-2036 the
potency (100-fold decrease in ABL1native IC50 vs. compound 3) required for a clinical drug
candidate. A derivative of DCC-2036 lacking the 2-fluorine substituent on the phenyl ring
maintained full potency for inhibiting ABL1native and ABL1T315I (IC50 1 nM and 7 nM,
respectively), demonstrating that the orientation of this fluorine is not critical for inhibition
of the gatekeeper mutant by DCC-2036 (data not shown). The structure of DCC-2036 with
u-ABL1native also revealed an ideal hydrogen bond (2.76 Å) between the carboxylate side
chain of E282 and the guanidinium side chain of R386. We speculate that this Type II

switch state E282/R386 hydrogen bond induced by DCC-2036 contributes to its high
potency vs. u-ABL1native (IC50 0.8 nM).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DCC-2036’s mode of binding provides a durable mode of Type II inhibition that affords a
prolonged off-rate, resiliency to high ATP concentrations, and overcomes the clinical
problem of conformational escape resistance by making interactions within the Type II state
(Figure 2A) that override the effect of point mutations that drive ABL1 towards the active
Type I state. We refer to this type of inhibition as conformational control inhibition.
DCC-2036 inhibits both ABL1T315I and ABL1H396P (IC50 values of 4 nM and 1.4 nM,
respectively), which are known to exist predominantly in the Type I active conformation
(Azam et al., 2008; Young et al., 2006). Structural data (Figure 2B) suggest that DCC-2036
may, in part, lead to conformational control of ABL1 by invoking an inhibitor-participating
hydrophobic spine (Azam et al., 2008; Kornev et al., 2006) in which a portion of DCC-2036
substitutes for phenylalanine in the third spine position while also making interactions with
the second and fourth spine residues, M290 and H361 (Figure 2B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DCC-2036 exhibits high potency against cell lines expressing mutant forms of BCR-ABL1,
including T315I and H396P, that collectively account for more than 85% of TKI-resistant
CML patients in whom ABL1 kinase mutations are identified (Shah et al., 2002; Shah et al.,
2007). ABL1 mutants involving the P-loop residue E255 (E255V/K) were relatively less
sensitive to DCC-2036 (Table 3), and are also refractory to the type II inhibitors imatinib
and nilotinib. In the native ABL1 structure, the acidic side chain of E255 makes an
electrostatic interaction with a lysine residue on the other arm of the loop, and disruption of
this interaction might distort the nearby ATP hinge region into which DCC-2036 binds. A
Ba/F3 cell-based mutagenesis screen for resistance to DCC-2036 recovered no BCR-ABL1
mutations at higher drug concentrations, while mutations at Y253 and E255 emerged at
lower concentrations (T. O’Hare, personal communication). However, pharmacokinetic data
from the phase 1 clinical trial have demonstrated that DCC-2036 can achieve plasma levels
well above these concentrations (data not shown). There were no mutations recovered that
are known to destabilize the inactive conformation of BCR-ABL1 towards its active, Type I
conformation (Azam et al., 2003; Sherbenou et al., 2010), nor were there mutations
identified in the switch control amino acids E282/R386, which may be required for
assembly of the catalytically active state (Kornev et al., 2006). Together, these observations
suggest that acquired resistance to DCC-2036 therapy in CML may be less frequent than for
the three ATP-competitive ABL1 inhibitors in current clinical use.

DCC-2036 inhibits BCR-ABL1, STAT5, and CrkL phosphorylation in BCR-ABL1expressing cells. In a Ba/F3 cell allograft model, oral administration of DCC-2036 resulted
in sustained inhibition of phosphorylation of both BCR-ABL1T315I and STAT5, a
significant reduction in leukemic burden, and prolonged survival (Figure 3). Oral
administration of DCC-2036 at doses of 60-100 mg/kg/d prolonged survival and reduced
circulating leukemia cells in physiologically relevant mouse models of CML-like
myeloproliferative neoplasia and Ph+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia induced by BCRABL1T315I (Figure 4) but had no effect on hematopoiesis in normal mice (data not shown).
Whereas plasma concentrations of DCC-2036 exceeding 50 μM were observed in recipient
mice, after accounting for protein binding (97-99%) the active in vivo drug concentrations
were in the range of 100-1000 nM (data not shown). Tested against primary patient cells in
vitro, DCC-2036 suppressed Ph+ myeloid colony formation and inhibited BCR-ABL1T315I
kinase activity and phosphorylation of STAT5 and CrkL at these concentrations but did not
significantly inhibit growth of normal BM progenitors at concentrations up to 2 μM (Figure
5A). Together, these results demonstrate a differential inhibitory effect of DCC-2036 against
BCR-ABL1-expressing vs. normal hematopoietic cells at clinically relevant concentrations.

Based on its composite properties and these positive preclinical results, DCC-2036 was
selected for clinical development. Correlative studies from the Phase 1 clinical trial of
DCC-2036 have demonstrated sustained inhibition of phospho-BCR-ABL1, phosphoSTAT5, and phospho-CrkL in refractory CML patients. In summary, DCC-2036 represents
a potential therapeutic option for patients with Ph+ leukemia who have relapsed on or are
refractory to conventional TKIs. Exploiting the diversity of switch control mechanisms
among different kinases is a promising strategy to develop molecularly targeted therapies for
hematologic neoplasms, solid tumors, and non-malignant diseases.

Experimental Procedures
Tyrosine kinase expression, purification, crystallography, and kinase assays
His-tagged ABL1 kinase domain proteins were overexpressed in Sf9 cells via a baculovirus
vector, and unphosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins purified by sequential Hi-Trap Ni
and POROS HQ chromatography. Crystals of ABL1-inhibitor complexes were grown by
vapor diffusion and diffraction data obtained with the beam source, data collection and
refinement statistics provided in Table S2. Purified ABL1 kinases were assayed by
quantitation of ADP production by coupling with the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase
system (Schindler et al., 2000). Detailed protein methods are provided in Supplemental
Information.

Cell Proliferation Assays
Ba/F3 cells (3×103 cells/well) or primary Ph+ leukemia cells (5×104 cells/well) were plated
in triplicate in 96-well plates containing test compounds. After 72h, viable cells were
quantified by resazurin (O’Brien et al., 2000) or MTT (Roumiantsev et al., 2002) assay as
described. Results represent an average of at least three independent experiments.
Immunoblotting Assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

2 × 106 Ba/F3 cells expressing native or BCR-ABL1T315I were incubated for 6 h in media
containing test compounds, then lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). In the case of Ba/F3 cells isolated from allografted mice or primary human
leukemia samples, mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation through FicollHypaque and cell pellets solubilized by direct boiling in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer
(InVitrogen). Protein was quantitated by the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay Reagent, equal
protein amounts loaded onto NuPAGE 5-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes (InVitrogen LC2001) by electroblotting. Blots were probed
using phospho-specific antibodies and bands were detected using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ) and a Molecular Devices Storm 840 phosphorimager in fluorescence
detection mode. Band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant software and
normalized for loading differences based on eIF4E content. Blots were stripped and
reprobed with the corresponding total antibodies. Antibodies against pABL1, pCrkL, ABL1,
STAT5, and eIF4E were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, pSTAT5 (pTyr694)
from BD Biosciences, and CrkL from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Allograft and retroviral BM transduction/transplantation mouse models of BCR-ABL1induced leukemia
Retroviral stocks were generated and titered as previously described (Li et al., 1999). Ba/F3
cells (1×106) transformed to interleukin-3 independence by transduction with either BCRABL1native or BCR-ABL1T315I retrovirus were injected intravenously into syngeneic Balb/c
recipients, as described (Ilaria and Van Etten, 1995). Beginning day 3 post-injection, mice
were treated with imatinib (100 mg/kg in water twice daily via oral gavage) or with

DCC-2036 (100 mg/kg in 0.5% CMC/1% Tween-80, once daily via oral gavage) or with
vehicle (0.5% CMC/1% Tween-80) alone. For induction of CML-like leukemia, bone
marrow (BM) from male Balb/c donor mice was harvested 4d after intravenous
administration of 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), transduced with BCR-ABL1T315I
retrovirus, and 5×105 cells injected intravenously into sublethally irradiated (400 cGy) Balb/
c recipients. Beginning at d5 post-transplant, cohorts were treated once daily by oral gavage
with vehicle alone, or DCC-2036 at 100 mg/kg. For induction of B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, BM from donors not pretreated with 5-FU was transduced once with BCRABL1T315I retrovirus and 1×106 cells injected into sublethally irradiated Balb/c recipients.
Beginning at d8 post-transplant, cohorts were treated twice daily by oral gavage with vehicle
alone, with DCC-2036 at 60 mg/kg, with imatinib at 100 mg/kg (in water), or with dasatinib
at 10 mg/kg (in 80 mM citric acid pH 3.1). All mouse experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of Tufts Medical Center.
Pharmacodynamic analysis of BCR-ABL1T315I inhibition in mice by DCC-2036

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Balb/c mice were inoculated with 1×106 Ba/F3 cells co-expressing BCR-ABL1T315I and
GFP as described above. On day 9 post-injection, leukemia-bearing mice were given a
single dose of 100 mg/kg DCC-2036 by oral gavage. At the indicated times post-dose, pairs
of mice were sacrificed, BM and spleen harvested, and single cell suspensions prepared. As
a positive control, cultured Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1T315I were used, while the
negative control was parental Ba/F3 cells starved of serum and IL-3 for 4h. For flow
cytometric analysis of pSTAT5 inhibition, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with ice-cold 95% methanol with vortexing, and stored at −20°C overnight.
For analysis, samples were rehydrated with 3 volumes phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% BSA
on ice for 1 hour, then incubated in FACS buffer containing Alexa 647-conjugated antiphospho-STAT5 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) in the dark for 30 min. Samples
were washed once and analyzed on a Cyan flow cytometer, gating on the GFP+ population.
Inhibition of pBCR-ABL1T315I was assessed by immunoblot analysis, as described above.
Inhibition of primary CML myeloid colony formation in vitro
Primary BM cells from a patient with newly diagnosed CML and from a normal individual,
and PB mononuclear cells from a patient with CML-AP and imatinib intolerance, were
plated (5×104 cells/plate) in triplicate in methylcellulose cultures (H5434, Stem Cell
Technologies), either without or with kinase inhibitors at the indicated concentrations.
Neither patient had detectable ABL1 kinase domain mutations. Colonies (CFU-GM) of >50
cell size were scored at d14.

Collection of patient samples
Clinical samples were obtained with informed consent and under the approval of the
Institutional Review Board of Tufts Medical Center. Peripheral blood or bone marrow from
patients or healthy subjects were separated by centrifugation in CPT tubes (BectonDickinson) for isolation of mononuclear cells.
Inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity in leukemic cells in vitro
Peripheral blood blasts from a patient with relapsed and refractory Ph+ B-ALL and
detectable T315I mutation (allele frequency 40%) were incubated overnight (initial cell
viability >90%) in IMDM supplemented with 100 μM 2-mecaptoethanol and 0.5% BSA,
and either without drug or with imatinib (1 μM) or DCC-2036 (50, 200, and 1000 nM).
After incubation, cells were lysed and protein extracts subjected to immunoblot analysis as
described above. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (7.5 ×105) from a patient with chronic

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Kinase inhibitors have ushered in an era of targeted therapeutics in oncology. In chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib
are now standard treatment, but acquired resistance due to kinase domain mutations is a
significant problem, particularly the T315I “gatekeeper” mutation that causes resistance
to all approved TKIs. DCC-2036 is an orally active TKI developed to exploit
evolutionarily conserved amino acids that regulate switching of ABL1 from inactive to
active conformations. DCC-2036 has efficacy against BCR-ABL1T315I in preclinical
models and in primary patient cells, and represents a treatment option for patients who
fail conventional TKIs. Rational design of “switch-control” inhibitors is a promising
strategy for targeting the kinome in cancer and other diseases.

Figure 1. Structures of switch-control inhibitors of ABL1 kinase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Compound 1 contains a tetrahydro-isoquinoline (THIQ) ring nitrogen that interacts with
switch control amino acid E282; a pendant carboxylic acid moiety that interacts with switch
control amino acid R386; a t-butyl moiety to bind into the hydrophobic spine position #3
pocket; and a 2,3-dichlorophenyl ring to bind into the extended hydrophobic pocket of
ABL1. (B) Compound 2 replaces the THIQ ring with a quinoline ring. (C) Compound 3
contains a pyridine ring nitrogen and a pendant carboxamide-NH moiety to form hydrogen
bonds with M318 at the ATP hinge. (D) Compound 4 incorporates the THIQ ring of
compound 1 and the carboxamide containing pyridine ring of compound 3. (E) DCC-2036
incorporates the quinoline ring of compound 2 and the carboxamide containing pyridine ring
of compound 3. The IC50 of each compound for inhibition of the kinase domains of purified
ABL1native and ABL1T315I (see Experimental Procedures) are indicated. See also Figure S1
and Table S1.

Figure 2. Co-crystal structure of DCC-2036 bound to ABL1T315I kinase

(A) Ribbon diagram of the Type II conformation of ABL1T315I in complex with DCC-2036.
Note the trajectory of the quinoline C2 carbon oriented towards E282 (d = 3.30 Å). The
activation-loop internal switch (green) is in the ‘off state’, with F382 occluding the ATP
pocket and Y393 occluding the substrate-binding pocket, making a hydrogen bond with
D363. DCC-2036 makes additional hydrogen bonds with E286 (2.80 and 2.90 Å), and with
the ATP hinge residue M318 (2.95 and 3.18 Å). Key hydrogen bonds and electrostatic
interactions are highlighted as dashed lines. (B) View of the DCC-2036/ABL1T315I
complex. The activating hydrophobic spine is disrupted by displacement of F382.
DCC-2036 makes stabilizing interactions with spine residues M290, H361, and the
displaced residue F382. DCC-2036 (t-Bu moiety) occupies the third position in this
‘inhibitory’ hydrophobic spine. Key interactions of the inhibitor quinoline ring with the
E282/R386 switch pair are also shown. See also Figure S2 and Tables S1 and S2.

Figure 3. DCC-2036 inhibits BCR-ABL1 signaling in Ba/F3 cells in vitro and in a mouse
allograft model

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Inhibition of BCR-ABL1 signaling in Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1native (top
panel) or BCR-ABL1T315I (bottom panel) by different concentrations of DCC-2036.. (B)
Complete and sustained inhibition of pSTAT5 in mice bearing Ba/F3-BCR-ABL1T315I
leukemia cells following a single oral dose of DCC-2036 at 100 mg/kg. At the indicated
time after the dose, mice were sacrificed and the level of phosphorylation of STAT5
assessed in leukemic (GFP+) cells by intracellular staining with anti-pSTAT5 antibody and
flow cytometric analysis. The grey histogram represents the level of STAT5 activation prior
to the dose, while the pink curve is from parental Ba/F3 cells starved of IL-3 and serum,
representing baseline STAT5 activation. (C) Immunoblot analysis of phospho-BCRABL1T315I and phospho-STAT5 levels in spleen tissue extracts from the experiment in (B).
Note that due to contributions from non-leukemic cells, the extent of pSTAT5 inhibition is
not as great as in panel (B). (D) Survival curve of cohorts of mice injected on day 0 with 106
Ba/F3 cells expressing either BCR-ABL1native or BCR-ABL1T315I, and treated beginning on
day 3 with either imatinib at 100 mg/kg twice daily or DCC-2036 at 100 mg/kg once daily
by oral gavage. The survival of the T315I DCC-2036-treated cohort was significantly longer
than either the T315I imatinib-treated or vehicle-treated cohorts (P<0.0001, Wilcoxon test).
(E) Box-style plot of spleen weights (mg) from Ba/F3-BCR-ABL1T315I leukemia-bearing
mice treated with vehicle or DCC-2036, assessed at the time of morbidity or death. The
difference in spleen weight of the DCC-2036-treated and the vehicle-treated cohorts was of
borderline significance (p = 0.06, unpaired t-test).

Figure 4. DCC-2036 has efficacy in mouse models of CML and Ph+ B-ALL

(A) Survival curve for recipients of 5-FU-treated BM transduced with BCR-ABL1T315I
retrovirus, treated by oral gavage beginning at day 5 post-transplant with vehicle (red line,
n=10) or DCC-2036 at 100 mg/kg once daily (green line, n=14). All recipient mice
succumbed to CML-like MPN. The difference in survival between the two cohorts is
significant (p = 0.007, Wilcoxon test). (B) Scatter plot of peripheral blood leukocyte counts
vs. time from the cohorts in panel (A). Red squares represent individual vehicle-treated
mice, while green circles represent individual DCC-2036-treated mice. The difference in
mean leukocyte counts on d20 between DCC-2036- and vehicle-treated cohorts was
significant (p = 0.0002, unpaired t-test). (C) Survival curve for Balb/c recipients of non-5FU-treated BM transduced with BCR-ABL1T315I retrovirus, treated by oral gavage beginning
at day 10 post-transplant with vehicle (red line, n=6), imatinib at 100 mg/kg once daily
(black line, n=7), dasatinib at 10 mg/kg twice daily (blue line, n=10), or DCC-2036 at 60
mg/kg twice daily (green line, n=14). The survival of the DCC-2036-treated cohort was
significantly prolonged (Wilcoxon tests) compared to cohorts treated with vehicle (p =
0.0184), imatinib (p = 0.0474), and dasatinib (p < 0.0001).

Figure 5. DCC-2036 inhibits BCR-ABL1 in patient leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Inhibition of BM-derived myeloid colonies (mean + SD) from a newly diagnosed CML
chronic phase patient (left panel), a patient with relapsed CML in accelerated phase who was
intolerant of imatinib (middle panel), and a normal individual (right panel). In the left and
middle panels, the differences between any of the drug-treated cultures and Untreated were
significant (p < 0.001, t-test), while none of the differences in the right panel were
statistically significant. (B) Inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity and signaling by
DCC-2036 in leukemic blasts from patients in vitro. Left panel: Patient with Ph+ B-ALL and
the T315I mutation, which had an allele frequency of 40% estimated from DNA sequencing
data. The relative levels of phospho-BCR-ABL1T315I, phospho-STAT5, and phospho-CrkL
vs. untreated are shown. Note that this patient expressed the p190 isoform of BCRABL1T315I. Right panel: Patient with CP-CML and a L298V mutation. PB leukocytes were
incubated for 3h with the indicated concentrations of DCC-2036, and CrkL phosphorylation
quantitated by immunoblot analysis of quadruplicate blots. Data (mean normalized pCrkL ±
SD) were fitted to a sigmoidal curve (GraphPad Prism) and an IC50 value calculated. (C)
Pharmacodynamic analysis of inhibition of CrkL phosphorylation by DCC-2036 (tosylate
salt in formulated tablets, 100 mg BID dose level) in circulating CML cells in vivo obtained
on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 of treatment in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Left panel: patient with
CML chronic phase and V299L mutation (note that on day 8, samples before and 0.5-2 h
after dosing were not obtained). Right panel: patient with CML accelerated phase and no
detectable BCR-ABL1 mutation. pCrkL levels (mean + SD) normalized to percent of day 1
pre-dose level are shown below. See also Figure S3.
