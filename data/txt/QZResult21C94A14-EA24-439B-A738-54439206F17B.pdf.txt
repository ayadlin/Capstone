Abstract
The lung is an organ that is sensitive to mutations induced by
chemicals in ambient air, and transgenic mice harboring
guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene as a target
gene are a well-established model system for assessing
genotoxicity in vivo. Transcription factor Nrf2 mediates
inducible and constitutive expression of cytoprotective
enzymes against xenobiotics and mutagens. To address
whether Nrf2 is also involved in DNA protection, we generated
nrf2 +/ ::gpt and nrf2 / ::gpt mice. The spontaneous mutation frequency of the gpt gene in the lung was approximately
three times higher in nrf2-null (nrf2 / ) mice than nrf2
heterozygous (nrf2 +/ ) and wild-type (nrf2 +/+) mice, whereas
in the liver, the mutation frequency was higher in nrf2 / and
nrf2 +/ mice than in nrf2 +/+ wild-type mice. By contrast, no
difference in mutation frequency was observed in testis
among the three genotypes. A single intratracheal instillation
of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) increased the lung mutation frequency 3.1- and 6.1-fold in nrf2 +/ and nrf2 / mice,
respectively, compared with BaP-untreated nrf2 +/ mice,
showing that nrf2 / mice are more susceptible to genotoxic
carcinogens. Surprisingly, mutation profiles of the gpt gene in
BaP-treated nrf2 +/ mice was substantially different from
that in BaP-untreated nrf2 / mice. In nrf2 / mice, spontaneous and BaP-induced mutation hotspots were observed
at nucleotides 64 and 140 of gpt, respectively. These results
thus show that Nrf2 aids in the prevention of mutations in vivo
and suggest that Nrf2 protects genomic DNA against certain
types of mutations. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5643–8]

degradation via Keap1-Cullin 3 E3 interactions (4). However,
oxidative or electrophilic modification of Keap1 triggers Nrf2
stabilization (5, 6). During oxidative conditions, Nrf2 translocates
into the nucleus and activates cytoprotective gene expression by
heterodimerizing with small Maf family members and binding to
antioxidant-responsive elements (ARE) or electrophile-responsive
element in regulatory regions of cytoprotective genes.
Nrf2-mediated induction of cytoprotective enzymes plays an
important role in mitigating the adverse effects of mutagens and
oxidants. In Nrf2-deficient mice, which have attenuated basal and
inducible expression of these enzymes (7): (a) DNA adduct
formation is accelerated after diesel exhaust exposure (8); (b)
hepatotoxicity is enhanced after acetaminophen administration (9);
and (c) benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)–induced DNA adduct and neoplasm
formation in forestomach is more prevalent than in wild-type mice
(10, 11). Taken together, Nrf2 attenuation or malfunction may be an
important aspect of diseases caused by environmental mutagens or
oxidants, although the mechanism linking Nrf2 deficiency and
mutation frequency is not well understood.
Transgenic guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) delta mice
are a model system for detecting in vivo mutations (12). In this
mouse system, the gpt gene is integrated into the genome as a
target gene for detecting mutations, and when the gpt gene is
rescued from genomic DNA to Escherichia coli, gpt mutants can be
randomly selected as rescued E. coli colonies that form on plates
containing 6-thioguanine (6-TG). To assess whether Nrf2 deficiency
increases the mutational risk following exposure to BaP, the current study uses nrf2 / ::gpt mice to analyze mutagenic activity
in vivo. Furthermore, alterations in the mutation spectrum between
nrf2 +/ and nrf2 / mice were assessed after exposure to BaP.

Introduction
Nrf2 is an essential transcription factor for inducible and
constitutive expression of several phase II detoxification enzymes,
including glutathione S-transferase-a (GST-a) and GST-k and UDPglucuronosyl transferase 1A6 (1). Nrf2 also regulates the expression
of antioxidant enzymes, including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 and heme oxygenase-1, in response to oxidative stress (2, 3).
Keap1 acts to harness Nrf2 to the cytoplasm, and Nrf2 in this
complex rapidly undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal

Materials and Methods
Mice. C57BL/6J nrf2 knockout mice (7) and gpt delta mice (C57BL/6J
background; ref. 12) were as described previously, and gpt mice were
obtained from Japan SLC. Nrf2-deficient mice (nrf2 / ) were crossed
with gpt delta transgenic mice (nrf2 +/+::gpt/gpt), and the resultant F1
mice (nrf2 +/ ::gpt/0) were crossed again with Nrf2-deficient mice (nrf2 / )
to produce nrf2 knockout gpt mice that are homozygous (nrf2 / )
or heterozygous (nrf2 +/ ) to the nrf2 knockout allele (nrf2 +/ ::gpt and
nrf2 / ::gpt, respectively). Genotyping for nrf2 was accomplished by PCR
amplification of genomic DNA isolated from tails. PCR primers were as
follows: 5¶-TGGACGGGACTATTGAAGGCTG-3¶ (sense for both genotype)
and 5¶-GCCGCCTTTTCAGTAGATGGAGG-3¶ (antisense for wild-type mice)
and 5¶-GCGGATTGACCGTAATGGGATAGG-3¶ (antisense for LacZ). The
presence of the gpt transgene was confirmed by PCR as previously
described (12). Nine male Nrf2-deficient gpt delta mice (nrf2 / ::gpt) and
nine male heterozygous nrf2 knockout gpt delta mice (nrf2 +/ ::gpt), both
7 to 9 weeks old, were obtained from this breeding scheme. Experiments

were done according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at National Institute for Environmental Studies.
Mouse treatment. BaP (Wako Pure Chemical) was dissolved
in tricaprylin [CH3(CH2)6COOCH2]2CHOCO(CH2)6CH3 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Five nrf2 +/ ::gpt mice and four nrf2 / ::gpt mice were treated with 1 mg
BaP dissolved in 50 AL tricaprylin given in a single intratracheal instillation
under anesthesia with halothane for mutation analysis as previously
reported (13). Vehicle (50 AL tricaprylin) was given to five nrf2 +/ ::gpt mice
and four nrf2 / ::gpt mice as BaP-untreated groups. For immunoblot
analysis, three nrf2 +/ or nrf2 / mice were used for each group. Mice were
sacrificed 1 and 14 days after BaP administration under anesthesia with
ethyl ether for Western blotting and mutation analysis, respectively. Lungs
were removed, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC until
the DNA was isolated.
gpt mutation assay. Genomic DNA was extracted from the lungs using
the RecoverEase DNA Isolation kit (Stratagene). Lambda EG10 phages were
recovered from the genomic DNA using Transpack Packaging Extract
(Stratagene). E. coli (YG6020 expressing Cre recombinase) were infected
with the recovered phage harboring the gpt gene and the chloramphenicol
(Cm) acethyltransferase (cat) gene (a selection marker), and these genes
were rescued as a plasmid (14). The gpt mutants can be detected as colonies
arising on plates containing Cm and 6-TG. The bacteria were then spread
onto M9 salts plates containing Cm and 6-TG, which were incubated for
72 h at 37jC for selection of the colonies harboring a plasmid carrying a
mutated gpt gene and cat gene. The 6-TG–resistant colonies were streaked
onto selection plates for confirmation of the resistant phenotype. The cells
were then cultured in Luria-Bertani broth containing 25 Ag/mL of Cm at
37jC and collected by centrifugation. The bacterial pellets were stored at
80jC until DNA sequencing analysis was done. Mutant frequencies for the
gpt gene were calculated by dividing the number of colonies growing on
(M9 + Cm + 6-TG) agar plates by the number of colonies growing on (M9 +
Cm) agar plates, which is the number of colonies harboring the plasmid. To
ensure determination of the mutant frequency, mutant colonies were
selected from over 300,000 colonies (15).
PCR and DNA sequencing analysis of 6-TG–resistant mutants. A 739bp DNA fragment containing the gpt gene was amplified by PCR using
primer 1 and primer 2, as described previously (13). The reaction mixture
contained 5 pmol of each primer and 200 mmol/L of each deoxynucleotide
triphosphate. PCR amplification was carried out using Ex Taq DNA
polymerase (Takara Bio) and done with a Model PTC-100 Thermal Cycler
(MJ Research). After the PCR products were purified, sequencing reactions
were done by using a DYEnamic ET Terminator kit (Amersham

Biosciences). The sequencing primers (primer A and primer C) were as
described previously (13).
Immunoblot analysis of GSTs. Frozen lung was homogenized with 2 mL
of 50 mmol/L HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
DTT, and 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by glass-Teflon
homogenizer chilled with ice. The homogenates were subjected to two steps
of centrifugation at 4jC (15,000  g for 15 min followed by 100,000  g for
60 min) according to Chanas et al. (16). Resulting 100,000  g supernatants
(cytosol fractions) were stored at 80jC until use. After the cytosol fractions
mixed with sample buffer containing 1% SDS were heated at 95jC, 9 Ag
protein ( for detecting GST A1/2) or 3 Ag protein ( for detecting GST A3 and
GST P1/2) from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE with 15%
polyacrylamide gel (17). Proteins separated on the gel were transferred to
Immobilon-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). GST A1/2, GST A3
(18–20), and GST P1/2 were immunochemically detected using anti-mouse
GST A1/2 and A3 rabbit sera (kindly provided by Dr. J.D. Hayes, University
of Dundee, United Kingdom) and GST P1/2 rabbit serum (kindly provided by
Dr. I. Hatayama, Aomori Prefecture Institute of Public Health and
Environment, Japan), respectively, and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled
with horseradish peroxidase (16). ECL-plus and Typhoon 9400 BioImage
analyzer (Amersham Biosciences) were used to visualize bands.
Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as mean F SD. Statistical
significance of mutant frequency was evaluated using the Student’s t test.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical comparisons of
mutational spectra were done using the Adams-Skopek test (21).

Results and Discussion
The frequency of spontaneous mutations in the lung, liver, and
testis was compared among gpt delta mice (nrf2 +/+), heterozygous
mice (nrf2 +/ ), and homozygous mice (nrf2 / ). In the lung and
liver, the mutation frequency was significantly elevated in nrf2 /
mice, compared with nrf2 +/+ mice (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table
S1). The mutant frequency in the lung was approximately three
times higher in nrf2 / mice (1.40 F 0.28  10 5) than nrf2 +/
and nrf2 +/+ mice (0.48 F 0.05  10 5 and 0.50 F 0.16  10 5,
respectively), whereas the mutant frequency was significantly
higher in both nrf2 / and nrf2 +/ mice (1.24 F 0.13  10 5 and
1.47 F 0.15  10 5, respectively) than nrf2 +/+ mice in liver (0.72 F
0.24  10 5). In contrast, no difference in mutation frequency was
observed in testis among the three genotypes (Fig. 1A). Whereas

the DNA repair system is quite efficient in the testis (22),
metabolically active tissues, such as the liver and lung, seem to
be unable to efficiently repair the DNA adducts produced by
reactive oxygen species and/or endogenous mutagens without the
presence of Nrf2. These results suggest that Nrf2 acts to suppress
spontaneous mutagenesis in the lung and liver.
We aimed to quantitatively determine how Nrf2 deficiency
affects mutagenicity in vivo in the lung using a single intratracheal
instillation of BaP as a model environmental mutagen/carcinogen
(13). BaP in cigarette smoke or ambient air is readily oxidized to
reactive intermediates, such as BaP diol epoxide, by phase I
detoxifying enzymes (23), and these intermediates are subsequently
metabolized to hydrophilic conjugates by phase II detoxifying
enzymes that are under Nrf2 regulation. However, unconjugated
reactive intermediates, which often form, lead to DNA adduct
formation (24). DNA adducts cause mispairing of DNA bases and
induce gene mutations through the DNA replication process
(25, 26). This process has been confirmed by in vitro experiment
using BaP adduct-containing DNA as a template (27, 28). Indeed, a
single intratracheal instillation of BaP into gpt delta mice resulted
in a statistically significant and dose-dependent increase in the
mutant frequency in the lungs of gpt delta mice, and the most
frequent mutation induced by BaP was G:C to T:A transversion
(13), which is characteristic of BaP mutagenesis (25, 26).

Therefore, nrf2 / ::gpt and nrf2 +/ ::gpt mice were given a
carcinogenic dose (1 mg; ref. 29) of BaP through trachea, which
resulted in a significant increase in the mutation frequency in lungs
of both nrf2 +/ and nrf2 / mice. Importantly, BaP-treated nrf2 /
mice had a 2-fold higher mutant frequency (2.93 F 0.56  10 5)
than BaP-treated nrf2 +/ mice (1.47 F 0.31  10 5; Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Table S2). The increment of mutant frequency by
BaP treatment was higher in nrf2 / mice than in nrf2 +/ mice.
We thought that the expression level of Nrf2-regulated
cytoprotective enzymes may explain both the higher basal mutant
frequency in the Nrf2-deficient mouse and that following treatment
of Nrf2-deficient mouse with BaP. Because Chanas et al. have
shown that the class k GST isozymes are expressed at substantially
lower levels in the livers of Nrf2-deficient mice than in wild-type
mice (16). Because a thorough study of pulmonary GSTs in Nrf2deficient mice has not been described in the literature, we decided
to examine whether expression of GSTs was actually suppressed in
the lungs of BaP-treated and BaP-untreated nrf2 / mice by
immunoblotting. In this study, we have examined expression of
GST A1/2, GST A3, and GST P1/2, as these GSTs are known to be
under the regulation of the Nrf2-ARE system (7) and are essential
for the detoxification of BaP (30). Showing very good agreement
with the report by Chanas et al. (16), which analyzed the expression
of these enzymes in the mouse livers, the expression level of GST
A1/2 was suppressed in the lungs of nrf2 / mice compared with
that in the nrf2 +/ mice (Fig. 2), and the level of GST A3 was also
low in Nrf2-deficient mice (data not shown). Under the experimental condition, GST A1/2 level was not elevated substantially by
the BaP treatment in the lungs of nrf2 +/ mice. Similarly, the
expression level of GST P1/2 was also suppressed in the lungs of
nrf2 / mice compared with that in the nrf2 +/ mice. GST P1/2
level was elevated by the BaP treatment in the lung of nrf2 +/ mice,
but there was no such difference in nrf2 / mice. As the change in
this immunoblotting experiment was relatively small, we repeated
this experiment and found that the result was reproducible (data
not shown). These results thus suggest that Nrf2 keeps the
mutation frequency at low level in the lungs of mice by directing
the expression the GSTs. As the changes in this GST immunoblotting experiments was relatively small, we speculate that lack of the

other Nrf2 target genes may also contribute to the mutant
frequency in Nrf2-deficient mice.
To further characterize the mutational profile in the lungs of
nrf2 / ::gpt and nrf2 +/ ::gpt mice after BaP exposure, we did DNA
sequence analysis of 178 gpt mutant lung samples (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Table S3). In nrf2 / mice, the predominant

58), G:C to A:T transition (24%, 14 of 58), and base deletions (19%,
11 of 58; Supplementary Table S3). A previous report of gpt delta
mice (mmh/ogg1::gpt) suggested that accumulation of 8-hydroxyguanine in cells was the primary cause of increase in G:C to T:A
transversion (31). 8-Hydroxyguanine may also play a role in the

induction of G:C to T:A transversion in the lungs of nrf2 / mice
because the level of antioxidant enzymes were suppressed in
nrf2 / mice, and subsequently, generation of reactive oxygen
spices was probably accelerated.
The BaP treatment increased base substitutions at G:C pairs
and one base deletion both in nrf2 +/ and nrf2 / mice (Fig. 3).
Among the G:C substitutions, G:C to T:A and G:C to C:G
transversions were markedly elevated in nrf2 / mice after BaP
treatment. Consistent with our previous studies with gpt delta
mice (13), the predominant mutation provoked by BaP treatment
was a G:C to T:A transversion (a major base substitute induced by
the BaP-DNA adduct formation) in both nrf2 +/ (32%, 14 of 44)
and nrf2 / (34%, 21 of 62) mice (Supplementary Table S2), and
the mutant frequency of this transversion was higher in BaPtreated nrf2 / mice than BaP-treated nrf2 +/ mice (Fig. 3). In
the lungs of nrf2 / mice, DNA adducts are probably accumulated in the higher level than those in nrf2 +/ mice because the
expression levels of phase II enzymes that detoxify BaP by
forming conjugates (32) and antioxidant enzymes are low in
nrf2 / mice comparing to nrf2 +/ mice. We surmise that this
increase of DNA adduct formation might elevate the mutant
frequency of G:C to T:A transversion in the Nrf2-deficient
condition. Additionally, generation of oxidative DNA adduct due
to BaP-derived quinines (33) may be accelerated in nrf2 / mice
and play a role, albeit partly, in elevating the mutant frequency in
nrf2 / mice. Indeed, BaP adduct formation was accelerated f2fold in Nrf2-deficient mouse forestomach compared with wildtype mice (11), supporting our contention that the increase in the
amount of DNA adduct enhanced the frequency of these
transversions at G:C pairs.
To delineate the mode of mutation in Nrf2-deficient mice, the
mutation positions in the gpt gene of BaP-treated and BaPuntreated mice were determined (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S4).
Of the mutations found in BaP-treated mice (shown in lower side of
the gpt sequence; Fig. 4A), G:C to T:A transversions at nucleotides
140, 143, and 189 were observed in three or more mice, including
both nrf2 +/ and nrf2 / mice. Thus, these nucleotides are the
hotspots of BaP-induced mutation. These nucleotides coincide
with those previously reported (i.e., nucleotides 115, 140, 143, 189,
and 413; ref. 13), which are shown with green arrows in Fig. 4A. The
frequency of mutation at these hotspots was rather low in BaPuntreated mice (shown in upper side of the gpt sequence; Fig. 4A).
Because mutations were accumulated at relatively high level in
the gpt gene of nrf2 / mice even without BaP treatment, we
assumed that we could assess hotspots of spontaneous mutation in
these mice. Indeed, G:C to A:T transition at nucleotides 64 was
observed in three BaP-untreated mice and one BaP-treated mouse.
This mutation is exclusive in nrf2 / mice. Thus, nucleotide 64 is
the spontaneous mutation hotspot in Nrf2-deficient condition. In
contrast, nucleotides 110 and 115 are common hotspots in BaPtreated and BaP-untreated mice; G:C to A:T transition at position
110 was observed in three BaP-untreated and three BaP-treated
mice, and G:C to T:A transversion was also induced in three BaPuntreated mice.
Figure 4B shows mutation hotspots in the gpt gene. We found
that one of the major trinucleotide sequences with BaP-induced
guanine nucleotide mutation in this gene was CGT (nucleotides
110, 143, and 189). This is in good agreement with the previous
observation that the instillation of BaP into the lung of gpt delta
mice induced mutations frequently in CGT trinucleotide of the
gene (13). CGG (nucleotides 64, 115, and 413) was another

www.aacrjournals.org

frequently found trinucleotide with guanine nucleotide mutations,
but no link was found between this mutation and BaP treatment. It
should be noted that guanine centered in CGC at position 140 was
a frequent target of BaP-induced mutation in Nrf2-deficient
condition, whereas previous experiments showed mutations were
little in CGC of wild-type mice (13).
Whereas there was no significant difference in the mutation
frequency, the position of the mutation was significantly different
between BaP-untreated nrf2 / mice and BaP-treated nrf2 +/ mice
(Fig. 4A; P < 0.05, Adams-Skopek test). This result suggests that
chemical mutagenesis and spontaneous mutation in the nrf2 /
mice arise through different mechanisms. Thus, the Nrf2 deficiency
had a marked affect on the mutational profile that arose either
spontaneously or by BaP induction. However, further studies are
required to clarify how Nrf2 deficiency alters the mutation profile,
and whether nucleotides surrounding the guanine nucleotide are
important for the mutation frequency in BaP-treated mice and in
BaP-untreated nrf2 / mice.
Several lines of recent evidence have pointed towards a role for
Nrf2 in prevention of carcinogenesis. One of the salient examples
is that Nrf2 could prevent the formation of DNA adduct and
gastric tumors from occurring after BaP administration (10, 11).
Furthermore, Nrf2-deficient mice are sensitive to the alkylating
agent [N-nitrosobutyl(4-hydrixybutyl)amine] and rapidly form
bladder tumors after administration (34). This study shows that
Nrf2 can prevent increase in the number of spontaneous and
inducible mutations that occur in the gpt gene in mouse lung and
liver and can prevent the induction of mutations at the hotspots,
such as nucleotides 64 and 140 in the lung. We surmise that
through induction of phase II and antioxidant enzyme activities
as well as cross-talk with phase I detoxifying system (35), Nrf2
can mitigate the effects of mutagens, such as BaP, on adduct
formation, leading to protection from neoplasm and tumor
formation and ultimately aiding in prevention of pulmonary
diseases that arise, such as lung cancer from tobacco smoke (36),
or from hyperoxic injury (37).
The results presented in this study suggest that Nrf2 deficiency is
a possible risk factor for development of lung cancer or other lung
diseases caused by mutagens or oxidants in ambient air. Whereas
molecular mechanisms by which Nrf2 deficiency changes the
mutation profile still require clarification, one plausible explanation is that Nrf2 deficiency may allow accumulation of specific
reactive oxygen intermediates or electrophiles. We are now
examining how exaggerated mutagenesis in the Nrf2-deficient
condition quantitatively contributes to the enhanced carcinogenicity. We believe that the Nrf2-deficient gpt delta mice will provide
useful information for revealing the relationship between in vivo
mutagenesis and carcinogenicity.
